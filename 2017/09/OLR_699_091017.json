{"text": " Orange Lounge Radio Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki Tonight, prepare your brains for a huge retcon, one that takes Mario down a notch or two, allowing him to only be able to rely on the skills of his entire gaming history. Stay tuned for this and the rest of the week's gaming news, hopefully not all as shocking, starting right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice. Orange Lounge Radio Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio, live tonight on September the 10th of 2017, episode number 699 of our show. Here to talk about video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle with all of you guys out there on the entire internet, all of it, and my co-host here in studio, DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers up first. Sup? Hi, how are you? I'm full now. You're full? Full of garbage? I'm just kidding. No, you ate my food and it was delicious. Yes, yes. DarkSakura cooked a chicken or something. What was- Well, Dan, I made Dan grill it, but I marinated it. Oh, you worked together! I made a marinade. Aww, it was like a very husband-wife thing to do, cook together. Yeah. Aww. Did you enjoy the week off? How was your labor day? Laborious? No, I was out in 105 degree weather watching Peppermint perform. Yeah, yes, I missed all that. Well, I mean, the rainbow festival and all that that you were doing sounds like it was awesome, but the heat wave? No thanks. I went home pretty sick. I think it says something pretty strongly that Atlanta was having perfect weather. The humidity wasn't even that bad, or I'm just used to it now after five years of Dragon Con. The humidity wasn't even that bad. When I was reading all the stuff back home about 115 degrees here in Sacramento, I was like, nope. No thanks. I went out to work the rainbow festival, and it was nice doing something good for the community, but there were fewer vendors than there were last year. Last year was actually my first year going. But I have to say, though, Taryn Through You was, of course, the hostess, local queen, who was always amazing to watch. And Mercury Rising performed, who's another local queen, who is also just a really nice person. And then finally Peppermint came on stage and sang. Oh nice. Like legit sang, didn't lip sync. Okay. And it was a really good performance, but by the time I was done with it, I was way too hot. And so I couldn't get like cool until I got home under the cold tap. So it was really bad. I got a little hot heat sick. Yeah, the heat was no joke. I would not have wanted to been out in it if I was here. So I'm kind of really glad I missed it for that reason. Yeah. Well, I also missed him. Say hello to Techmaster Loki. How are you doing? I'm doing fine. And happy birthday early. Tomorrow is Loki's birthday, for those that are unaware. What, 36? 37. 37? In a row? Oh, there we go. It's this year. Yay. In a row? Thank you, DarkSaga. Well, happy early birthday to you. And I noticed that the misses kind of went in on a gift for you with you. Obviously, it's your money too. Yeah. I mean, not to play it down or anything, we were shopping for a car. Anyways, it just happened that we found on this weekend. Sure. So you got a new car. Yeah, I got a brand new car. Nice. So I had a 2008 fit and I traded in for a 2017 fit. There you go. And now it's not red, it's white. Okay. And the next one can be blue because America. Exactly. Even though it's a Japanese car. But I have something. I was going with some sort of- I was going with Mexico, I think. I was going with some sort of reference there. Great. Well, happy early birthday and glad to hear you got the new car. We'll check in with everyone's gaming weeks in just a little bit and get into our kickoff topic. But first, I want to say hello to our chatters over at live.vognetwork.com because we do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice Geeks Network, vognetwork.com. Six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show. And some folks in chat tonight commenting that the quality of the show seems different, which is weird because I did not make any changes except I uninstalled and reinstalled Skype to get that to work. Well, I also have a new microphone. That's right. Loki does have a new microphone. So that might be worth mentioning because some of you guys were mentioning a couple weeks ago. I think we found there was a short in the cable or something like that. So Loki may sound different. I would expect that. But I wouldn't expect the entire quality of the show to be different. That's the weird- God, no. Lower those expectations. Well, we'll see. Hopefully the podcast sounds the same. Maybe it just has something to do with the live broadcasting or something. Who knows? I don't know. Maybe it sounds better. I don't know. Anyway. Hey, if you are discovering Orange Launch Radio because of Dragon Con and the podcast track of the Dragon Con event, I just want to say hi and welcome because the podcast track was awesome in having me on several panels this year. And I got to do a lot of networking. I had a great time at Dragon Con. This was my fifth year there. And I almost feel like this is the best one yet in many ways. And a lot of great motivation coming from Dragon Con and the podcast track. I really want to thank Brian Dunaway from Film Sack. And I want to thank Charles McFall from Pokemon Go Podcast and everyone really involved in the podcast track. Because I don't remember all the names and podcasts off the top of my head. But I want to thank everybody for having me as a guest this year and letting me participate in panels because I'm sure it was very motivating for other people, but it was also very motivating for myself. And yeah, I just had a great time. So welcome to our little show if it's your first time listening and you found out about it over at Dragon Con. I'll give you the elevator pitch on Orange Launch Radio real quick. We're on episode 699 tonight. So we've been going for 15 years. 15 years ago, myself, Loki, and DarkSakura, we all met playing a little video game called Dance Dance Revolution. Yes, where the arrows scroll up the screen and cheesy techno dance music plays all the time. But we loved it. And there was a whole community around that game and all the music games that Konami was putting out around that time in a series known as Bamani Beat Mania. So we all got together being fans of that. And we started this little show for that community to monitor the tournaments, to monitor the new releases of these games. Because, you know, there were six or seven games in the series that were all getting new updates. So we were about music games in the beginning. But as the Mamani series kind of started to slow down, we had a little lull before Guitar Hero 2 really took off and I think changed the industry kind of back into music games with that and rock band. We kind of shifted to, it was right around the time podcasting got bigger. So we kind of shifted to a show that's now podcast about all video games. Because it turns out there's more games we like than just DDR. Right, Dark Sakura? There were other games that you played back then besides just DDR. Like you would use your dance mat to play Soul Calibur, right? I'm just kidding. I feel like you tried that at one point. I did. Yes, I knew it. But I beat the game with Rod Calibur. Nice. Okay. See, there you go. There you go. It works best with Siegfried. I remember you were the first one that ever introduced me to, well actually, when I was first getting into DDR, I mean, I always knew that obviously I knew gaming in Japan was a scene and that they had games that we did it and all that. But it was really because of DDR and meeting people like Dark Sakura that like my eyes really got opened up to how like, oh, what do you mean it's called Bust a Move in Japan and all the songs are different and most of them are actually better. And what do you mean that there's this whole Castlevania game that I never got to play here in the US and all this other stuff like my eyes really got opened all that. So, you know, now here we are 15 years later. Welcome to the world of imports. Yeah. Right. Right. That was what it is. You taught me how to mod my first PlayStation. Actually, it wasn't. You didn't really have to teach me much. You were like, here, I have like Here's a paperclip. No, here is this plug because I have 5000 extras. You put this plug in the back of your PlayStation. Have fun. Yeah. Yours was the one that you use like the five point switch for. But it still had the I.O. port in the back, which meant all you have to do is just use the plug. Yes. We still have a first gen PlayStation that takes like you use a paperclip. Yeah. Or a really stiff twist tie. Just hold the button in and then switch your desks. So, yeah. So we all learn from each other about this great gaming culture. And we invite all you to do it every week because, you know, we used to play DDR. And after we were done playing DDR, we'd all go to the food place out front of Roseville Golf Land. And we'd sit there and have dinner and talk a little smack about our favorite hobbies. So that's kind of this is the world's biggest diner table is how I envision it. And we're just here to talk a little smack about gaming news. I don't think we're going to break gaming news here. I think there's plenty of blogs and Twitter and all that stuff that's going to break the news. But we're going to we're going to discuss it and try to learn, you know, from each other's perspectives about it. So there you go. That's Orange Launch Radio in a nutshell for those that are new. I probably should have saved that spiel for next week, being that it's 700 next week. But I can always just refer back. Go listen to last week's episode. Talk more about what Orange Launch Radio is. All right. Anyway, SSU100 Matt in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says you're just missing the mozzarella sticks. And let me tell you, the mozzarella sticks at this place is it's I think it's a local chain called Brookfield's. The mozzarella sticks, they're bomb. They're really good. Like some of the best. So anyway, just saying, just saying. All right. Let's get into our kickoff topic tonight, which actually for our kickoff topic tonight, we want to talk about some of the news that we missed while we were out. So I picked three big headlines from last week leading into Labor Day that I thought we could talk about here at the top of the show. First off, Nintendo announced last week, well, I don't think they really I guess they did announce it, but it was kind of obviously they don't want to make a big deal of it. But they did mention that as of November 8th, Nintendo TV, Wii U chat and Miiverse will be discontinued. Those services on the Wii U are no longer. So effectively, the Wii U is being taken out back and shot on November 8th at three o'clock in the afternoon Japan time. The official Miiverse site, including what you see on the Wii U and the 3DS even, are not going to be there. However, Super Mario Maker, it says that will still be working. Details to be announced later, but my assumption is they're going to do a patch that routes things a little differently and kind of removes that Miiverse element. But everything else that associates with Miiverse is going to be closed. There will be error codes when you try to access Miiverse, but it is gone. TV, on the other hand, that was, you may not be aware, that already went away in North America. TV is going to be leaving in Japan as well, where I think it's still been going. But obviously Miiverse is kind of the big thing out of that. So folks here in studio, folks in chat, what do you think? Are you surprised to hear that Miiverse is sending hiccups this fast? Or is it one of those things where you're like, not really surprised that Nintendo is quickly pulling the plug on a console that is just done, pretty much? It's just kind of weird that they developed something like this and then didn't carry it over to the Switch. And they have nothing to replace it. Well, I mean, as far as nothing to replace it, what's interesting about the Switch is that it feels like it's built in to just games natively on the Switch. Like Splatoon 2 kind of worked around it. Like Splatoon 2 has this very Miiverse-esque thing in it. Yeah, but it's all separate. It is separate. Miiverse was all kind of one community and now you're splitting everybody off in their own communities, which is kind of dumb. But, was it a community worth saving? Like, here's just real talk. I mean, there was a lot I did like about Miiverse. There was, I kind of feel like Nintendo kind of unlocked something a little bit charming with Miiverse. But, it was kind of slow and clunky, not really fun to browse on the Wii U sometimes. You know, just kind of had that Nintendo clunk to it when it comes to online. So, it wasn't something where I was like, oh, I got to wake up and check Miiverse the same way I check Twitter or Facebook. Like, it didn't really snap the same way, so it didn't encourage me to check Miiverse as often. But, I mean, then why even carry it forward then in Splatoon 2 then? Why even bother doing something like that if they're like, oh, this is terrible? Because I think, well, okay, that's great. Oh, it's terrible, but it's not terrible, but it's still terrible. That's a good question, but maybe it's something that that team wanted to keep going. Because I will admit, seeing some of the trends in the pictures and stuff that you get on Splatoon 2 have been kind of charming. Like, there was the whole trend with all the furry stuff going on. And then there was all the pro-trans stuff, which I thought was awesome that you were seeing a lot of that in the game. And that was kind of, you know, there was about a week of that. And then people were talking about the whole, I wish blank was real. You know, like, it feels like Splatoon 2 is kind of like this meme play field for all these things. Although, you know, we're talking about rights and stuff, that's not really a meme. But you know what I mean, like, there's definitely like that topic of the week, be it a serious thing or a meme, that feels like it's going on in Splatoon 2. And it's a fascinating thing to watch in that community, in my opinion. I don't know. But you're right, it's me versus nothing. But those are the same terrible people that were on Miiverse that are now in Splatoon 2, so. But what's it- It's just like, they want it both ways. Well, but what's interesting about that is because of the way it's designed in Splatoon 2, the terrible stuff doesn't get elevated. Because you can only like things, and the things with the most likes tend to get elevated. You can't dislike things. You couldn't dislike things in Miiverse either. I'm trying to think. No, you couldn't. But I think Splatoon, to be fair, I don't think anything's changed in that regard since Splatoon 1. Splatoon 1 had all its memes that made it, you know, what it was too. Alright, whatever. It's different. It's still the same. Whatever. It's terrible. Let's put it back in there. Except don't lean on this game and separate everybody out. Because this is what we think the consumer wants. JD in chat says, you can also report things that are super bad. That's true. JD also points out, my Nintendo account still gives bonuses for logging into Miiverse. Well, I imagine that's going to be changing relatively soon. I wonder what it's going to do to me, Tomo. That's a- Ooh, that's a great- Because there was just an update. That's a very good question. But does Mi- Tomo isn't really powered by Miiverse. Mi Tomo's a separate thing. Does anybody still play that? Yeah, Jamie does. Okay, aside from Jamie. Tons of people. There's dozens of them. Not as many as in the first week, but I know, like my buddy Jonko says, was trying to get me to check in on it. So there's, there's other people that check in on it. Well, um, at any rate, they just put out an update to go with the, um, I think some of the other Mi options for- I'll have to look at the, the update history. There was an update just a week ago. So. Uh, Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, more people play Mi Tomo than Pokemon Go. That's probably not true. I can't argue with that logic. But, but I would bet more people play Mi Tomo than Ingress. That I would bet. So, you know, you can't say that it's totally an itch thing. Uh, anyway, let's see. Um, what was the other thing I wanted to say? Oh, Kaizhudo in chat says, my Mi verse wasn't slow and clunky at all. Maybe your wi fi was janky. Well, it runs this show okay. So I don't know. It just, it just didn't- Like, you know how the internet just kind of snaps when you're on your phone, you bring up Facebook and snap, there's your feed. Like in Mi verse, it was like- Blum, blum, blum, blum, blum, blum, blum, blum, blum, blum, blum, blum, bling. And then like you click into something else? Blum, blum, blum, blum, blum, blum, blum, blum, blum, blum, blum, blum. It's an invisible hamster right on the wheel. You just don't see the little hamster in my Wii U that powers It doesn't have enough processing power to render the hamster. Like don't don't get me wrong I'm not trying to dog on Miiverse like there was some good stuff that came out of it, but it wasn't perfect You know and there's a lot of Nintendo's online ventures aren't but I mean But Nintendo did it Nintendo's way and it brought some new things to the table as a result. So I'm What? For me it's it's like Nintendo Throwing darts at a dartboard, you know They have all these things that are gonna revolutionize something and it doesn't and it just doesn't do anything Or it's just not as like fantastic as they had talked it up to be like remember the whole Wasn't the whole face chat thing with the Wii U wasn't that supposed to be like a revolutionary thing? No that fucking went nowhere because they didn't leave supported. Well you first was that a revolutionary thing Yeah for a short period of time and it went nowhere that way obviously nowhere enough to carry them You know it to the next platform. You know what I will give you that I do feel that Nintendo did kind of put out these features and then really did nothing to Elevate it I think would be the right word because for example, like you say the the video chat on Wii U was pretty rad Imagine if that could have been hooked in through 3ds somehow I mean there's a lot of stuff and this goes back like even further than that I mean if you talk about like the whole AR support with the 3ds Fucking did nothing with that and to be fair Sony did fucking nothing with that either with the Vita So right, I mean there's that it's not unique to Nintendo in that so it's just I Don't know like what's the newest thing that they're seeing is like revolutionary? Okay, the switch being able to take it places and play with people and stuff like that. Mm-hmm Okay, so how are they gonna fuck that up? I mean, I just got to figure it Well, but but Loki you're you're assuming that Nintendo fucks everything up and I would say no They don't because for example the the Wii itself was a gamble and the fact that you know the motion control But I mean we tennis Elevated that and sold the shit out of the yeah They got lucky and they're trying to recapture that magic and they're just not it's not happening that was that was a dart that connected and TV on the other hand was a dart that missed but I think Nintendo really I Think Nintendo missed out on trying to elevate the fact that you could participate in TV along with shows like American Idol Yeah, it was pretty cool and you could do it and like you would never know it because Nintendo was really bad at elevating that So I that that's my criticism of Nintendo We should do that now like have an app call it watch party and they have different things. Okay Game of Thrones We're doing Game of Thrones tonight or something like that Like Why isn't that a thing? That's such a low-hanging fruit idea. No, I'm with you. I'm with you. I don't know I am. All right. Anyway, let me look and see if there's any other comments in our chat room over at live Vogue network comm let's see Kaiju doing chat says Nintendo made the big mistake and forgot that most gamers over 12 years old or Antisocial and like to play alone and not communicate. They only communicate when they want to complain about something But now when I play with friends when I play with strangers, maybe but not when I play with friends I want to talk a lot when I play the friend I get it cuz I feel very Antisocial when I want to play on like is I really I would like to just play friends Mm-hmm. I don't really like playing with strangers I'll do it. Like the only time is like if I'm you know, like even Grand Theft Auto 4 was like a game I really play heavily in or call of duty or something that play strangers just wasn't as fun as playing with friends So I feel that Let's see, I don't remember where this came up from but dungeon buster says more games should bring back the sound test feature Why not? Yes. Yes, they should they should also have creepy Hidden messages Allah sonic CD. Yes, or they should have these sounds that you play them in the sound test You're like that wasn't in the fucking game. What is that? That's like a woman moaning. What is Test that was when we used to put the PlayStation disc and rip all of the sound files off of it How some of us found out that the demo disc for Jammer Lamy still had the health statement All right. Let's talk a little bit about moving on to Sonic Mania So obviously Sonic Mania was a huge game that came out a few weeks ago And in the last week when we weren't here They've released the PC version which a lot of people were looking forward to well Unfortunately, there was a little bit of a gotcha in the PC version that it was using a DRM system That's pretty controversial known as de nouveau Meaning that from what I understand usually this DRM kind of requires the game to always be online Allah Diablo 3 Allah any MMO that's gonna be connected but Sonic Mania supposed to be a single-player experience So people were really not happy about that because you shouldn't have to be online to play a game like Sonic now to be fair Since the controversy from last week My understanding is that there has been an update the DRM is still being used But once you log in to activate it, you don't have to stay connected to steam anymore You can actually play it offline. That is the fix that went in place According to Sega on their face just don't put it in there in the first place How about that people really don't like their DRM on PC? That's for sure But I also I think it's also because that it's more of that That particular DRM like it basically it's almost like malware. It just it doesn't uninstall itself You know when you uninstall the game it's just it's a pain and they're even saying that with it enabled The performance of the game wasn't as good Alright so yeah, that's true when that's hogging up resources it can it can really clog up the game And yeah a pin and then on top of that. Here's the best part about it So because the game was delayed a week or something like that. Mm-hmm. They gave everybody on Steam, you know, hey, here's a copy of code for Sonic 1 Well, guess what that actually con or that counted as the purchase date then on on This the game so then once the game finally did get released you had less time or no time to File a refund if you wanted to do that through Steam All right, yeah, and then also the other follow-up is that that whole DRM was cracked in eight days because of court You know what? They say hackers gonna hack, right? So they're only motivated when it's Yeah, so there you go. Anyway, that was a thing that happened now Let's move on to some positive news and I definitely wanted to mention this at some point towards the top of the show But obviously we have a lot of listeners out there that have been affected by these storms that have been going on around the country You know, obviously there's a lot of focus right now on Irma and what's happening with Florida and we have quite a few listeners in Florida area so of course, you know thinking about you guys, you know I'm talking to some of you on discord and on Twitter and I know everybody's doing what they need to do to stay safe So that's great. But still it's like just one of those like wow, this is really awful but I mean this is right on the heels of what happened in Houston and with with Harvey and Just seeing what happened there is is awful and you know believe it or not here in California in the 90s I lived in a neighborhood that flooded that was pretty bad and so, you know I kind of know what it's like and I'm not gonna say I know exactly what it's like I kind of know what it's like to go through something like that and it sucks like it really really sucks and it's scary and so But most importantly I just hope that everybody that listens to OLR is safe. That's the most important thing. Everything else is stuff Granted some of it is very sentimental stuff, but you know stuff at the end of the day It can be replaced you cannot so yeah, I hope everybody is safe and all that stuff so thinking about you guys and a lot of the gaming community coming together to do some good for support of victims and games done quick Which of course does though what awesome games done quick and they do Summer games don't quick is the other one. They really threw together a fast Marathon and they did it virtually which you know, of course you have to do if it's last-minute But they did a Harvey relief done quick and they raised $225,000 that's almost a quarter of a million dollars for the Houston food bank, which is really cool Houston food bank providing meals cleaning supplies disinfection product products for people that were Affected by Harvey's so really happy to hear about gamers doing that. I'm sad I wasn't able to catch any of it Obviously I was out of town this past weekend, but I heard it was a lot of fun So I didn't even know what's going on. Oh, no, because I would have watched it Well, I'm sure they archived it all and put it on Twitter and all that stuff And yeah, if you still want to donate I'm sure they would not be opposed to that. So check that out All right. So anyhow That was something else. I wanted to bring up at least some good news from the past week So that is that's what's been going on in gaming this past week We will get into this week's headlines But first I want to go around and check in with our hosts and talk a little bit about how was your gaming week? Dark soccer. How was your gaming week? Um Um What did I play I played some pinball I played Simpsons pinball party at a leather bar It was in bad shape I Actually back in Sims 4 I've been looking for houses by Good designers, but maybe not be super famous. Like I'm not doing Frank Lloyd Wright houses. I'm not doing falling water but I'm looking for Contemporary designers like 50s and up and trying to recreate their houses in the Sims and then trap the people inside the walls of said Houses know those people live on like a 20 by 20 lot in a square room that has no toilet. I Want to see and I'm sure it's been done because it's the internet. Of course I want to see someone recreate like the saw houses or saw like facilities and put the Sims in there I'm sure there's some mods or something. I'm sure somebody somewhere has done it or the Winchester Mystery House I'm sure has been done. Yeah, someone's done that if Jamie hasn't done it herself I don't have time for that, but someone else did it for Sims 3 and I had it downloaded for a while I love the Winchester Mystery House though. I've never been do you know that you're fixing this Rob? Underwhelming you think no, it's just it's not tall people friendly cuz miss Winchester was four foot nine For those that don't know it's it's like a two it's one of those tourist attractions in Northern California. It's in San Jose It's like the nutshell. Yeah, mrs. Winchester is the wife of the Winchester gun bang bang Yep, and she thought that she was being haunted by all the ghosts of the people killed by her husband's guns Hired a psychic who said the only way to prevent them from killing you is to never stop construction on the house When construction stops you die Ironically which sounds like a trap and saw But anyway, but there's there's a seance room that has a door that leads to nothing to the outside from the third story There are stairs that go up to the ceiling and go nowhere There's all kinds of weird ghost traps in there and all the stairs because she was very arthritic very old and four foot nine So there's a little teeny like two inch stairs all the way through the house and then her collection of Tiffany lamps so There you go. There's your architectural and crazy person history of the day and You and sorry we were talking about the Sims though before we got But someone took the time to do the full version of the Winchester mystery house The what was it seven stories before the earthquake in? 1915 uh-huh wasn't that when that earthquake was with the big San Francisco one. Yeah, six six But yeah before that it had someone like seven or eight stories and now it's like at four yeah So they didn't rebuild all those and I've never been and they've also uncovered now other parts of the house And so I was watching this one person has like different revisions Based on different versions of the house, and then I I forgot and it's so weird too Cuz you think it would be like out in the middle of nowhere. It's right next to a movie theater It's like it is how well I mean movie theater the build-up around there the movie theater wasn't there when she built But it's just so weird to see like you kind of think spooky house on a hill or something like that. No Middle of downtown San Jose practically. Yeah, it's funny when because I went with with Kristen and we did like the The the full tour that took you under the house and everything too and the gardens and all that and then we went to see Pan's Labyrinth fun. I need to do one of the Halloween flashlight tours. I don't even like They do it on Halloween and every Friday the 13th. Ah Okay, but the one we did underground we had to wear hard hats and they did ghost stories. Oh boy Yeah, all right. All right Too spooky for me. I won't even go and see it I'm not gonna go see it because of what I heard that they did with the one minority character in it Hmm Alan really wants to see it cuz he likes scary movies, but I'm just like Brutal. Yeah, I don't wanna do jumpscares. All right. Anyway, let's get back to video games Loki. How was your gaming week? Um, I didn't play a whole ton of stuff. I did play some things. I went back and played Lewis Skyrim and I also played some The Lego movie game which is pretty fun and I also played some more of the office space. I don't clicker game on the phone because It's just on my phone and convenient but yes this week has been Like I Last weekend. I took a trip to the Lego store. I kind of wish I hadn't gone to the legos. Oh, I Bought a nice set is you know large. Let me guess for your kids knows from me No, I bought them their own sets but I I got this set for me I'm not ashamed that You know, I have a buzz it shouldn't be but it's just like it's like diving back into that whole like scene it's like wow, there's a lot of stuff out there, but yeah, and I don't want to go back to the story because it's There come my god And what's the $800 in the Millennium Falcon? Thank God. I'm not a star that big of a Star Wars fan now, however Then then Jago City looks pretty awesome and I'm not fanning Jago either but that's a pretty cool-looking set All right, anything else for your gaming week outside of all that Lego stuff? Uh, no, okay My gaming week, so I'm not a lot of new stuff. I've kind of been going back to stuff I used to play I did a stream earlier this week on no man's sky Which I'd kind of already done a couple weeks ago just kind of re-exploring kind of a lot of the changes So I started another new file from the very beginning on stream because I finally moved my PlayStation 4 Into the office where I do the live streaming so I can actually stream from PlayStation 4 Which I'm still trying to decide if I'm gonna do tonight or not. I'm on the fence about what I'm gonna stream tonight so yeah, there's that and Yeah, I've been playing PlayStation 4 games in there Otherwise, I've been playing like overwatch fall fancy 14 a lot of the same stuff I also randomly just kind of picked up heroes of the storm again Which I've been playing a lot of versus AI in heroes of the storm to get my little daily quest done So I could save up gold and I saved up 10,000 gold this past week and I bought diva Character for who's of course one of the big overwatch characters who was recently not that long ago Probably about a month or two ago put into heroes of the storm So I actually bought her so I could use her in play But I haven't really done a lot of player versus player just because I still feel like I'm I'm understanding the here's my thing With heroes of the storm and and a lot of MOBAs where I where I hit a wall in general I Understand kind of like the general rules how to play what to do what not to do and I kind of generally understand the operation my character What I'm still learning about that makes it very hard and I think to put my foot into the player versus player is that I'm not Familiar enough with what all the other players do because you know in a game like here's the storm There's like 40 different people you can pick from and I know the moves for the five or six ones that I like to play But then I'll be playing against somebody and I'm like, whoa He just did a move where he like froze me in place from across the battlefield How did that happen, you know, and I'm still kind of like learning about all that So I don't know when it's safe to you know, like Yolo and run in there And I don't know when I got a hold back. So there's a lot of that stuff I'm still learning about and you know when you get into When you get into some of the competitive stuff people get a lot more heated if you don't know your stuff so I've just been a little little sheepish and getting in there, but I'm gonna find somebody who plays a lot more than I do to take me under their wing and go maybe a Grandpa from courthouse plays a lot of heroes of the storm I don't know if you guys know but he's like level 400 probably so I'm gonna try to get him to take me into some matches and Check it out and play a little more of that. So that's that's You know pretty much a game that I've been playing quite a bit of this week But yeah, not really otherwise not a lot of new stuff I mean when I went to Dragon Con I played like enough Splatoon to have participated in the Splatfest Which we ended up losing anyway But at least the theme was better than the catch-up mayo thing At least this the invisibility of flight was like, okay flight one and that's not the team I picked But at least I'm not like offended by that Let's see and then I got to play some of the cool arcade stuff that they had Dragon Con cuz you know they get they have Tokyo Attack was there who brings a lot of Japanese and import arcade machines to conventions and then they have like a classic bar In the area brought in some classic arcade machines So I was able to play some of those too. Are they supposed to be bringing the table flipping game in there? Yeah, they had two at the table flipping game at Dragon Con. Yeah, it was cool I I never got around to playing that I was playing neon FM because it's the first time I'd seen a neon FM Neon FM that had Korean songs in it and I was like what so I had to play, you know, like mr Simple and some of the songs that I recognized, you know from what kpop I've been exposed to I had to play that stuff because I thought it was awesome that that was in neon FM So I hope that's in all the machines and not just the ones the Tokyo attack is moving around cuz I want to play all Those songs cuz yeah kpop is awesome What else I want to say, oh the classic arcade I will say this the classic arcade the the joystick bar I think it was called that brought these games in they had a Donkey Kong remix Machine and the Donkey Kong jr. Remix machine I didn't get to play jr. Somebody else is on that but I played Donkey Kong remix and basically I mean it feels like it's just a ROM hack basically of the original Donkey Kong But like with modified levels basically and it's it's flippin hard. I couldn't even get past like halfway You know, the first board is like climbing up You know the rafters and ladder I couldn't even get like halfway through that board I guess I'm not a real gamer But I couldn't even get like halfway through that board like it was crazy hard, so Yeah, so Donkey Kong remix means Donkey Kong hard as hell Basically, that's all about so but it was it was cool to have played one kaizo kong That would be a good alternate name for it, but that's uh, yeah, that's what it is All right. Anyhow, uh Let's see going to our chat over at live dot vog network comm act Def says that diva got introduced in heroes of the storm when the officer diva skin got introduced into overwatch Oh, that was a few months ago. I guess I've just been kind of out of it. Oh, yeah, Bobby Blackwolf reminds me We did play pac-man vs Because he has the Namco thing on the switch and then I downloaded that app that lets you play Pac-man vs. So we played that on the switch. That was fun. I like that. That was a good party game So, I mean, it's a bummer We didn't get to play it with more people because it was just Bobby and I and then like two computer ghosts So wasn't as thrilling as I'm sure a room full of people is but we had fun. It was a fun game. So alright We're gonna move on to some other Announcements such as please follow us on twitter twitter.com slash olr We're also on facebook at orange lounge radio as far as upcoming shows off. I can't think of any I think we're gonna be here for the foreseeable future We'll probably take something off around the holiday, but no more conventions or anything like that Sadly I'm not I'm not even gonna go to magfest this next year sadly, and it's nothing against magfest. They're great I just go to dragcon with me next year. I I'd love to actually go to that at some point I just I have no more time off work after everything that happened over the summer I burned all my time off. So I have to make some cutbacks I had to take the time off to go to drag gun con had to take that unpaid So but it was worth it. It was totally worth it. I'm quitting Wow, you're quitting Wow Yeah, no one plays anymore and it's it's true not fun playing by myself Oh, well, what about what about trying to find a new posse to play with like, yeah I bet there's some great like like-minded gamers out there. Like well, here's the bummer I would say talk to the ladies from girls gone Wow, right like raven each other server. They would what's that international? They don't have an international server. That's the problem They don't have an international server because I bet those ladies would love to have super like flying around though If Final Fantasy 14 had flying around and not shitty, you know leveling system then I would go back You do have flying around in the later areas You know, you don't have jumping off of things and extending wings and getting into places. You're not supposed to go You do have jumping off of things with your wings in the later areas You have to get in heaven's ward, but you could do it, but it's your wings Yeah, you get a you get mounts that fly. I don't want a flying mount. I want like demon hunter powers Oh That type of demon hunters are fucking fun. No, then no, you don't have that in in file man Demon hunters are fucking fun. You need to I know you don't like first-person shooters, but in overwatch Mercy made me nauseously sick. Oh, that's a bummer because Mercy's getting a new ability It's gonna let her fly around anywhere and it's fun to play with and go to places You're not supposed to go to on the political show. So not nauseously sick. That's a bummer. Sorry to hear that They should consider a third-person mode that might help with that If it was third person, I could probably have no problem playing it see and it would I wouldn't think it would be that hard To implement because you can spectate other people Maybe or maybe there is a way to do it and I just don't know maybe our chatters know over at live dot vog network calm Let's see. I'm also looking at our chat. Oh, I remembered what other games we played Go ahead before we get into news we played we put we broke out the Neo Geo. Oh Yeah, I saw some your picture played summer. I should own two well ours is a Japanese once the summer my spirits to and the first summer I show down and I think some magician Lord So we played the Neo Geo with the huge cartridges the size of someone's head at least a small child's head About a little bigger than a baby a little bigger than a baby. All right Let's get into some gaming news and I'm gonna there's there's a lot of controversial stuff this week guys I I I guess this was the week where everything blew up So brace yourselves, but we're gonna be we're gonna be tactful as we dive into the controversy tonight starting with this whopper, right? Logie, so South Park factory hole is gonna be coming out I'm thinking next year now and so they've been doing some like kind of gaming It's actually in six weeks. If I if I remember I'd it's like six like end of October in it. I got delayed No, I thought I got delayed My will look into that just so we are accurate, but I thought I thought it had been delayed to this one I was looking forward to oh, maybe maybe I'm thinking that I don't know I know it's one I was looking forward to so maybe hopefully it's coming out soon, but it is yeah worldwide October 17th That's what I thought. Hey, you're getting yeah, you got confused because it was delayed It wouldn't be surprised if it's That's fair. It's fair. But yes, it's so Should be coming out soon and Of course, they're doing you know with that the whole media blitzing where their gameplay previews and stuff and so one of the very beginning parts of the game is creating your character and so like Unlike actually the first South Park game you can actually play as a girl or even a transgendered person in this one But there is a portion of the game where it's asking me to pick your skin color and it says with that, you know it's also your game difficulty and With Cartman says he actually makes a comment. Don't worry. This doesn't actually affect combat It's just every other aspect of your whole life, which I think is kind of funny So actually a pretty good commentary it to be crystal clear the easy mode You have light skin the difficult mode. You have dark skin now basically, it's gonna be it's gonna the way that's gonna work is it's a the amount of money that you get from You know different events and also how characters treat you in the game so There could be some hilarious, you know South Park stuff, you know with the police I'm sure you know like the whole Michael Jackson episode. Mmm. Well, you know, go ahead Darcyra. I honestly think that it's Not in there to be crass per se but it's in there as part of I think Commentary on current society, but they're also though. I mean they also have it in there where you can be a transgender character Yeah, after picking your skin color you meet with mr. Mackey who? okay about your Gender identification so that includes male female or other and then even after choosing one of those you can choose specify if your cisgender or Transgender and I guess he like if he calls your parents to confirm all that stuff as well Because there's they kind of played back to the joke, you know, cuz the original game all you could be is a boy in there Yeah, and so like that's so weird. You know, we thought this whole time that you were a boy. I mean It's just like kind of funny. Okay. Okay. I watched the scene where a person picked a cisgender female It's like you mean you knew she was a girl the whole time Yes Okay It was pretty funny so so here's the thing, you know what I got I'm gonna admit my gut reaction when I saw that whole like difficulty slider thing I was like, wow, that's fucked up. But then I was like, it's really fucked up in real life, too So that was that was pretty much my reaction to that, you know South Park doesn't really shy away from that type of stuff But and let me go to our chat over at live dot vog network comm cuz that guys you don't in our chat see Here's here's the part where I'm having difficulty because I I'm not black neither is Loki neither is darsakha But I know many of you we have many different colors out there that listen to the show, which is awesome And Kai's you don't in chat says I'm black and I find that hilarious and true. What's the controversy? Well from what you know because I haven't said a lot on this I've just been trying to read what other people have to say on this Some of what I'm seeing on Twitter from people of color just some of what I've seen, you know retweeted in my timeline and stuff some of the negative I'm seeing is that My or the the life experiences and I'm gonna try to summarize best I can here So, I'm sorry if I'm misrepresenting it But the life experiences and the things that I've gone through are not a joke Like this is not something to be belittled by a game type of thing. I don't know that it's in there is a joke But like even if it is a joke I don't think yeah, I get it that you're offended by it and great You can be offended by that but they make fun of everything Everything everybody everything is a joke everything. So Yeah, you'll be you'll be offended by this thing and then the next thing they do someone else is gonna be offended by that It's I mean what they had abortion jokes in the last game I mean, there's all sorts of I'm offended that sixth graders are bad guys There's all sorts of like jokes that are it's it's offensive and yes, it's okay to be offended It's not okay for you to expect them to change the game because you're offended by it I think you know It's it for me and you know kind of trying to think about this and process those sort of responses and try to weigh Like, you know the the negatives that I am hearing as well It's like the positives from people of color that like, you know, like I should have just said in chat Like what's the problem? This is you know funny or whatever so And when I come in turn away with that is that it kind of goes back to in my mind this whole video games are Art type of thing right and we've you know speaking of controversy That's been one of the age-old controversy in the video game community our video games art Well art is meant to provoke response So I would say in some ways, you know, he did this whole conversation that's happening right now is In a way and some people are gonna you know But but this is just honestly where my gut my gut is is going with this is that this whole conversation? We're having right now just kind of proves the fact that video games are art and the art may not be making a statement That you like but it's making a statement and it is a reflection on an art is a reflection on culture and it is Definitely a reflection on culture be it very a very sassy one, but it's you know, there's a lot of Serious fucking shit out there and reasons why there's things that exist like Black Lives Matter and so forth and to an extent I wonder why some people get offended About things that don't necessarily affect them. Does that make sense? Mm-hmm. Oh, yeah Call like I see it. I see all the time on tumblr all the time on tumblr not to say everybody on tumblr is bad That's not what I'm saying. But you get you get that stuff. We're like, um, what was that post? Oh some post that made its way onto like a Facebook screen cap where somebody Retweeted a picture of a little girl doing a Japanese tea ceremony and one tumblr user was like This is so effed up and it's cultural appropriation to the dot and then a person in Japan Responded to that saying actually we we love it type of thing kind of kind of similar with the Mexico and Mario Odyssey thing with a sombrero. It's like actually we kind of like it I will rather go on a limb and say though that there is a very very very long history of Japanese culture Adopting things from surrounding areas and making it something uniquely Japanese So I would think that seeing other countries do that may not be such a big deal, you know That being said what offended me is that number one the kimono was wrong It was done wrong All right, I'm gonna go to our chat because I do I was trying to make a joke I wasn't sure dark Sakura some things. I don't know. All right In in our chat over at live dog network calm Bobby black wolf says this and I think that this is a fair response by black wolf says controversy is this a black person who wants to play a character that looks like them has to either deal with The harder difficulty or play someone who doesn't look like them That's why some people are upset but it's not everything like to say it's it's just like money payouts in the game Yes, I get that. Yeah, I Kind of annoying it would be it would be nice if maybe after they make the point Then there's like something where it's like press square to change, you know So, you know, maybe maybe like after they make their point you can actually because I know the combat you can tweak how difficult the combat Is yeah, like you can make that easier or harder depending on and you can keep change that throughout the game Yeah, so and I don't know like honestly playing the game but like last time with the money and stuff I don't think you ever run into a problem with it's probably just gonna be very minor. Mm-hmm It's just more of like ha ha it's like a silly thing that we did some of the controversial some of the one Positive I was gonna mention is they mentioned that the game is not gonna be censored in any country Unlike it was last time Oh with the whole anal probing stuff. They're not gonna censor it. I'm in a country So Australia is probably not gonna sell it. So it's gonna be exactly, you know as it is in all countries Much love to our Australian listeners, but you know that they there's games that get censored there all the time So anyway, Mortal Kombat and all that. All right. Anyway, I also would like to go out on a limb if I may Yeah, where people talk about Issues of appropriation and things like that and trying to like in the case of the game, you know Taking something that's going on in real life and making it an undisputable undeniable factor I think the thing that people need to realize is that I'm trying to figure out how to say this the right way sure that everyone is gonna borrow from everybody That's the whole point of having multiple cultures in one place Yeah, when you live in a melting pot like America things are going to melt You know and and yes, I realize there's a lot going on on a much higher level and stuff that you know Makes you wonder sometimes if America really is a melting pot But I think there's a lot of us that love that part about America Well as a share 100 Matt makes a good phrase in here in the last game You could pick a Jew class it changed the way the game was played. You also got different payouts and story and stuff Hi. Yeah, you know, um, I Think that maybe we might need a little bit more of these things desensitizing people a little bit, you know bringing those things to light instead of putting it in a Convenient package that we can get offended about for five seconds argue on the internet and then Conveniently put aside in our lives, you know, I think that's the big thing is that we are so enamored with that moment of Being the right one being right being right, you know that after a while It becomes the focus instead of actually going out there and doing good. So I'm glad it's in the game I'm glad it's bringing attention to things that people should be talking about instead of just putting on the back burner All right, and you know what? I invite other responses out there too. Like I said, I think on a topic like this I'm just kind of trying to listen to the different perspectives and you know interpret the art that way So I certainly invite all the feedback if you don't feel like your point was represented here tonight Participate at orange lounge radio comm come on up to the table. Like I said earlier It's a big diner table and let's hear from all those different perspectives in the meantime, though I'd like to move on with some more gaming news because it is only a three-hour show so let's talk about something going on on the Nintendo switch and This is controversial in a much different way, but literally a gaming controversy really Here's the deal is that you know I think a lot of people were drawn to the whole cartridge idea of the switch because oh well Then I'm not gonna really you know It's okay if there's only 32 gigs of storage or whatever it is on the switch because I can get stuff on cartridges and it's not really Taking a memory and you know, it's it's different right when you had an old-school Super Nintendo You didn't have to have a cartridge based or I mean you didn't have to have any type of like on Board storage or anything like that, right? So anyhow, um Excuse me Well, it turns out that may not be the case and I want to thank our discord for submitting this to us if you want To join our discord server and bounce us ideas throughout the week. You can vog network comm slash discord will get you an invite It's an open server I think it was dungeon buster that submitted this and I'm sorry if I if I get this wrong so anyway In the future some switch games are going to require you to actually own a micro SD card in order to play NBA 2k 18 is going to be the first game that's gonna require that additional storage to be present So yep, you can't actually fit all of 2k NBA 2k 18 onto just the cartridge You're gonna have to actually install some of it to the extra micro SD card your storage card now Here's the deal a portion of the title will be available outside the box But you I guess slowly download the rest of it while you're actually playing Representative for Nintendo of America actually said in a quote that yes a micro SD card will be needed for certain Nintendo switch games that contain an Especially large amount of content and require additional storage for players to enjoy the full experience If you purchase a physical version of a game that requires an additional micro SD memory card You'll be able to play a portion of the game right out of the box specific levels or mode to enjoy the full game Downloading additional data is required. So Apparently cartridges won't hold the whole game sometime I'm sure they would but they just have to have to pay for more expensive cartridges that hold more data God forbid we do that because then that would cut into our margin Yeah maybe this optical media stuff was Maybe that's why they do it because it's so fucking cheap could G why is the whole industry doing that? I don't fucking know why well, but to be fair in a portable environment I mean it worked. All right on the PSP, I guess but maybe optimal reading and stuff isn't I mean even the Vita used cartridges for a reason so maybe Optical discs and things weren't really the best in a portable environment. I mean, I guess the PSP worked Okay, but I'm sure even it had its limitations and you could make it skip if you shook it hard enough You know, I mean, so it's never I'm just saying low key in that regard I'm not saying that those I don't think we're that easy to duplicate as well. Well, here's what here's what it is Loki, let's be right. Here's what it is This is more a commentary on the fact that Nintendo's default out-of-the-box on storage space is way too small Exactly. That's that's the real problem. Was it 32 gigs? Uh-huh, cuz 32 gigs with fucking too small in the Wii U No, it's still fucking too small with this shit if that's just ridiculous, but but never fear Loki they'll be the 2018 model of the switch that comes in neon red and Fluorescent green and it comes with 128 gigs of storage fuck No, it'll come with like 64 gigabytes of storage or like 48 gigabytes or something stupid Now SSG 100 Matt kind of thrown it back a little bit saying I remember sports games dating back to the Dreamcast days Required that you played with a memory card. You wouldn't be able to continue without having a memory card inserted Well, I Mean you missed a lot on the Dreamcast without those awesome little VM you things which by the way Happy birthday Dreamcast because yesterday nine nine, you know all the way back to nine nine ninety nine was the Dreamcast birthday But you would miss out on stuff without those little VM use Well, it's also I think that was more of like Cashy and stuff because that was the only storage that there was on that system. So it was I Kind of always felt we had Tamagotchi to thank a little bit for that that it was kind of Dark sacrifice just gave me the biggest no face in the world But I kind of feel like that was in a way from that, you know, no you don't agree. Not at all All right. What's your take on it? I think that they wanted Something that was gonna make the system more unique and offer a more interactive type of play Mm-hmm. I mean cuz things like that had existed for years. Anyway having the little you know digital toys I mean if you want to go really I Would probably put the origin more in those little tiger toys or the game and watch so We're looking much further back and Akuma JP correcting my pronunciation Tamagotchi, I think I think we got spoiled here in the USA in Tamagotchi not not because the whole like stupid American thing But like gotcha was really ingrained in the culture with Pokemon and all that stuff So I think a lot of people would say gotcha as opposed like, you know Cuz that's that's what we kind of knew with Pokemon. Anyway, I'm just excusing my ignorance. Sorry But Tamagotchi and it's so you know what the name it's it would be a portmanteau Tamago for egg and Now my brain just forgot Chi Tamado Chi Oh Doesn't friend. Oh Okay, it's an egg friend. Okay, see I didn't but I actually didn't know that Okay, and I'm sure that they had no idea from the get-go that this would be an issue And that's why it's never been mentioned up until this point That this was gonna be a necessity. It's funny how after everyone's purchases systems it. Oh by the way This isn't gonna work exactly how you thought. Oh and this oh and that oh and that one other thing, too Yeah, have you heard some of the rumors about Nintendo having I know this isn't on the show world I've heard some of the rumors about Nintendo having a direct this week. Have you seen some of that? I don't fucking care cuz Apple's doing a thing this week So, you know where Apple goes Nintendo missed They're gonna blow them on stage because I mean seriously I don't care this point well actually actually Don't count it out Nintendo has shown up on the Apple stage before when they did Super Mario run and we know Nintendo's cooking a Zelda game in an Animal Crossing game So it is possible that Nintendo could come out and blow to fully look forward to that Zelda game I'm sure that's gonna be fucking don't knock it. They tried it. No. Yeah. I'm not saying that's not it's not possible for them To do is all the game like that cuz like I said, you know the DS games the DS All the games were pretty good and you could do those with mostly just the touch screen So it had a good control system for that However, I feel that they're gonna be tempted by the current, you know Mobile game scene and you're gonna get like a tapper game or some shit like that. It's gonna be like well That's not what I wanted but I would rather they give us a tapper game then try to bring breath of the wild To the phone cuz like you're not gonna be able to control that with a phone. I'm sorry I would rather it just be a fucking tapper game if that's you know, wrote the phone to throw the boomerang All right, but okay. Look we're getting away from the point. So Apple's doing a thing on Tuesday We all know they're expected to announce phones That's what all the rumors say Which is good news for me because I'm ready to upgrade from my six So I eagerly anticipate what they're gonna say But anyway Nintendo is rumored to do one on Wednesday now some people are kind of taking the ball and running with it and saying oh, this is when they're gonna announce Netflix and All the other things that we've been waiting for we're bringing Netflix to consoles for the first time ever It's never been done ever before. Well, okay. Well on this console Loki you joke but Nintendo and I've said this before on the show because and when we went back to Is it a big deal that Netflix is on it or not? I said this in the beginning I think yes Nintendo can make a huge argument that with certain Netflix shows because you know You can download a good chunk of Netflix library, right? You can start watching it on TV and then oh I got to make the bus click a little snap and I'm gonna pick it up and watch it on the go and continue my Netflix without an internet connection because It's been downloading in the background as I'm watching it. Like yes, Nintendo could say this is an experience You can't really do right now Except on my phone that I have in my pocket that I can do the exact You know the whole pick it up and go, you know, there's a twist to it But my phone certainly doesn't have 32 gigabytes worth of storage. I mean, it's just a phone You can't possibly fit that much data into a phone. It's Clearly this console is the only thing could do that It's just how about how are you just instead of fucking announcing Netflix, which really should have been there from the get-go How do we announce all the fucking shit that also should have been there from the get-go console virtual console a Web browser does that thing even fucking have a web browser? Yes. Okay. How do you think the e-shop works? Yes, but can you actually use a web browser on it? My understanding is it's been hacked because the e-shop or no the the network Okay The network thing has okay cuz like when I okay when I wanted to log into the Wi-Fi at the hotel during dragoncon To do Splatfest it actually because the hotel Wi-Fi you have to log into that right because you have to put in either the passphrase Or your last name and your room number to use hotel Wi-Fi, right? So believe it or not you try to connect to the network The switch is smart enough which not all game systems the password smart enough It pops up a browser window and it has the Hyatt's little screen Please put in your information that it added and all that and then it closes it and you're connected to the internet So yes there is a web browser and my understanding is people have kind of backdoored that because What you do is you use that same trick except the web page that you put on your personal network that you present is Whatever website you're really trying to get on the switch, which could be a flash game, you know I don't know if it's flash game, but you know, like games or something something else. So that's Okay, so it doesn't have a web browser that you can just click an icon and it works Okay. No, but there is it is is there a web browser in there? Yes. Can you use it? Not really that's Fucking makes sense that makes all the sense of the world Fucking hell, I swear whatever. You know what SSJ 100 Matt says, can you use the web browser for porn? I'm asking for a friend. All right, of course if you if you see me real, let's be real Nintendo needs to just have the real talk All right, Nintendo needs to have the real talk and give the gamers what they really want. All right, here's what needs to happen Excuse me Reggie fees and may needs to do a special 10 o'clock at night in Nintendo Direct Okay, he's gonna come out on this Nintendo Direct and say listen guys. I Know what it is. You really want out of your web browser I know what it really what it is. You really want out of your consoles. We're gonna give you all the porn you want And here's is the web browser. Yes, the Nintendo switch what you do. It's gonna it's gonna jack into sites such as Porn hub. Okay the new porn hub app for the Nintendo switch so you can start new me verse But it's you can start watching ever Yeah, you the wee wee verse so you can start watching pornography on the big screen But then when you hear the garage door open that somebody's coming home Just take it off the and take it back into your bedroom and finish what you started. I Got you guys love Reggie fees and may But in order to have a separate would sell billions. You'd have a separate phone app and fucking like all the tethering cables possible They Would still find a way to fuck that up They would still find a way I know but seriously though like JD and chat says so Rob phones plus a Chromecast can pretty much already do this Well, you know what? Some people are gonna do it just because it's Nintendo. Let's be real Now we're cutting work cutting edge with you know, the 3d technology because you could view 3d porn on the 3ds Which is kind of cool. Yes. Yes, you could I mean granted It was just very low-res pictures in 3d, but it was 3d. I think I saw a blurry tit Kind of poked out. Yeah a little bit But no, seriously They just need to announce what the hell their fucking virtual console plans are because right now when the hell is that launching do we even? No, no, and I was again again I I am ready to accept the fact that virtual console my quote II fingers this time around is gamecube games and Maybe Nintendo Wii and Wii U stuff That's mostly just fucking make a stupid like fuck this NES classic bullshit And he has caught you know, the super NES classic just make a virtual console Done you plug it in your TV download all that shit. That's basically what it is. Anyway, here's here's what really okay So we've been talking for like five minutes about a rumored Nintendo Direct. We don't even know if it's happening or not Here's the thing guys lower them expectations lower them y'all cuz Mario Odyssey They got to get the pre-orders in for that. So I would bet if they're having a direct it's an expanded Look at Mario Odyssey. Oh, it's gonna be there fucking amiibo. There's a Metroid game out on Friday Did you hear so maybe it's gonna be an extended look at the new Metroid game, which by the way I think you all would want to know I Pre-ordered that Samus 3dsx. Yeah, you said no you ordered it. I ordered it and already gave them money. Yes All Right, anyhow, I just gave up my best smartass smile. Yeah, I see that a lot from you. All right, let's move on dark soccer Why don't you why don't you give us a story then and I'll be a smartass to you speaking of other Unnecessary prefixes. I'm only going to use the word once and then I will no longer use it so that you know what I'm referring to Microtransactions because they are a transaction. You don't need to quantify them with how big they are If I buy penny candy, is that a micro transaction? No, but I'm only spending pennies No That is just a transaction Okay, transactions are not necessarily quantifiable Except by the actual amount that you've spent on it anyway, so destiny fans are pissed. What else is new? They brought about this You know in-game stuff that you could buy for the original destiny and so they're bringing it back for destiny, too But this one is even Worse, I think they're selling shaders that you can change the color of your armor and then One I mean in the original game when the shaders were unlocked you could have them across all of your characters and Then delete them and pick them up later, but in destiny two shaders are one-time use they're consumable You would be spending money for a consumable That you will never have access to again real money for shit. You can't use again. I Will leave that there The only way you'd ever be able to get another one is either with like a blind loot box Again that you can get with real money Or buy them straight up. So yeah stupid and There are people who love to make their armor look certain ways. They would be buying it You can I mean you can earn them through leveling and chests and whatnot, but yeah people It's well, it's it's also the fact that in the first game it operated a lot differently than it does in this game That's that's what's really cheese and people it sounds like now granted. I haven't played destiny 2 yet I've been hearing actually outside of this controversy I'm hearing a lot of good things about destiny 2 and I'm really excited to check it out My only issue is that I I've already decided I want to get it on PC so I can keyboard and mouse it up But the PC release is a few weeks away. It's the end of October. Mm-hmm. So hmm. No destiny for me Excuse me yet. I did I did play I didn't talk about in my game I played like 20 minutes of the beta on PC because you know The PC beta was like the night before my flight to Dragon Con at 6 in the morning So I played like 20 I downloaded like 14 gigs to play for 20 minutes and I did enjoy my 20 minutes with destiny 2 also, I have to say that I Had the same thought that Bobby did just for my rendering classes He said when I first read the story I thought shaders was in the game was in the game development term for how your light sources get shaded and I was like wait You're paying for light source effects. And I was like that was the first thing that I thought of too, but it's more like color Yeah, it's basically like, you know how World of Warcraft you get a piece of armor from this dungeon a piece of armor for that dungeon and you look like like You look like a thrift store nightmare, right? Like you're mismatched all over the place, right? Well because of transmogrification some of that you don't you can fix that No, now everyone's got particular sets and you can still make the sets look like they match They just give you a particular type for your body type. Okay, we'll have different colors apply to it Well in a nutshell imagine that wasn't the case you still had mismatched stuff a shader will let you just dye it all matching colors and stuff like right off the bat and usually they are Shinier colors than what you might see native and I think I didn't play the original game But isn't the original game like the shader was used for like everything wasn't the full set or was it? per-piece I From what I recall you did the whole set like once you unlocked it you had it Yeah, it was the whole set and you can use it as many times you want So if you upgrade your armor, you can just change it again and all that stuff now You have to use it purse per piece. It's You can't change it out It's you know Basically once you've used it It's gone to consumable and then on top of that the only way to get it is through these loot boxes That you have to pay real money for And I guess you get some of them in the game But that's not even really the whole thing that people are getting pissed off People are also getting pissed off that there's mods in here and the mods basically grant you abilities to help you play better And so in a sense, it's kind of pay to win Because obviously someone that has more disposable Income and spends money on this are gonna have better mods or more mods to be able to be more competitive in a PvP scenario So, yeah, all right. Well, I can see why people are irritated but we'll see, you know a blizzard an Activision I mean, I know blizzards not the makers of destiny 2 it's Bungie, but Because there's the PC release and it's on an Activision has been known to throw in loot boxes and shit in the game Yes fucking EA started that but um, but I I think they might listen to some of the feedback. We'll see. We'll see I mean, I don't think they're gonna do a 180 on the system, but they've been pretty odd They won't listen to the feedback because they've already made a comment on it regarding the thing and so their comment was Well, no one's complaining about it. It's just you know, it's just Appearances and you know, anyways, you're gonna be swimming in those shaders. So it's not a big deal That was basically their comment I'm paraphrasing obviously But all right, let's move on. All right, so, um Blizzard is building their own eSports arena. So, of course, you know Starcraft is pretty popular and the eSports realm and of course, you know hearth storm and pretty much a lot of their line, you know games overwatch all that so now they're gonna be creating I guess the Blizzard arena Los Angeles, which is gonna be located in Burbank Studios It's gonna be one of the first arenas in the u.s Built specifically with eSports in mind and they're gonna actually open it up not too long from now October 7th, and that's gonna launch with the overwatch contender season 1 playoffs So, so are we gonna go take a tour go go see something there go see a show I'm not driving down there. I'll just take the word for it. We go to Disneyland while we're there. Why not? That's cool All right Moving on virtual tour moving on in news that will surprise. Absolutely. No one and and just Loki I already know what you're gonna say. We don't need to relive this every week. All right, but look, here's the thing I'm just gonna get it out there. So Nintendo switch. It's selling really well, of course We all know that and good old Reggie fisa made me to comment this week in an interview with variety Talking about supply for this holiday Certainly certainly the demand is there and our supply chain is there are we going to have enough for the holiday? That's what we're focused on Which was said in a way that makes it sound like it could actually be a challenge So, yep There that you may you may still have a problem getting enough of those on the shelves during the holidays now to be fair He didn't come out and say we're gonna have challenges during the holidays But the with the phrasing it kind of chose made it sound like he's not ready to guarantee it either Well, he's you know preparing people for that inevitability I'll be hopeful and hope that they do have enough supply but at this point it's like I Mean, I can't even be surprised by this. It's like like how How would you not get this yet? How do you not? Coordinate this stuff. Here we go. Here we go. I'm just shocked. I'm not like mad even I'm just like like bewildered Like how is it that company can't prepare like this? They you know, this part of the year is coming yet Yet somehow Well, we just can't do it then. Okay, my god, then maybe I don't know. I don't know what to do. I I'm just gonna send Nintendo my thoughts and prayers and see if that's as useful as This same thing that they've been pulling for 20 years. I'm just gonna I'm thoughts and prayers for Nintendo. It's like it's holidays I mean seriously, it seems intentional at this point I mean, they're they're either the most inept company when it comes to supply issues or They're doing it on purpose I mean because really that's really the only two options that there are right now because like how can you consider? consistently Not be prepared this many years in a row. I mean how many years has this been going on for? several years almost a decade if not more like How is it that you're just so ill-prepared for this every it's got to be fucking intentional. It's gotta be at this point There's no way that they're this dumb prove. It's not Reggie. It's seriously it's like I I don't want to feel if they're like this indicative company that's purposely doing this but Like going I don't know We'll certainly give it or we'll give it to college. Try. I mean like my god Bob coffee giving the fair Perspective here in Chad at live dog network comm saying might not be Nintendo's fault in this case Switch uses some of the same components smartphones use it's never their fault and with a lot of big smartphones coming out could be actual component shortages could it be Satan Yes, it's saying in a party like it's 1994 because They didn't know that you know Every year. I mean, I'm sorry it no, let's not we're not gonna blame other people for Nintendo's fault It's it's okay. What component shortages are there? They're used by smartphones that fucking super NES classic editions that are using because those have fucking supply problems, too That's not we're not gonna blame cell phones for this shit What we as they're going in the production again, they all have enough supply to fucking make those SNES classic editions What's the excuse there? JD in chat says it's the vegans fault If Nintendo would just go vegan and tell everybody that Satan so I mean stop it stop I know some wonderful vegans in my life. And yes, it was the church lady for The timing of you dropping that was was immaculate and caused MXC to say I love this show Well, we love you all that turn out every week and listen to know what else I love we do it for you, bro what I Don't know I don't have a heart I ripped it out and sacrificed it, you know, what else I love what tell me I don't know. I Love indifference. I love uncertainty. I love not knowing things. I love Keeping me. Thank you. Thank you. My keyboard kept my three keyboard cat moon shirt if you've never seen it I want to get a moon moon shirt a moo moo moon moon moon the stupid wolf moon moon Do you do do you know I have an official three wolves crying at the moon shirt? Yeah, I have it somewhere in the big laundry pile in the other room the cats probably said I almost wore it to Dragon Con That was gonna be one of the outfits I was gonna wear one day to Dragon Con but then I was like People might think I'm like not I saw your daddy outfit. Did you see? Oh, yeah, we didn't get to talk about that My cosplay. Yeah Dragon Con my I didn't even play the game and I knew what it was my lazy fucking cosplay Okay, so I did end up bringing two cosplay outfits to Dragon Con both of them were not quite bare enough for that So the first one the first one I did was I did Sami Zayn Because everybody fucking tells me I look especially Rama's Rama out there Rama Rama tells me I look like Sami Zayn and Some of my friends in the Bay Area my good buddy Kath who lives in the Bay Area She tells me I look like Sami Zayn. So she actually was so far to buy me a shirt You know who Sami Zayn is Loki nope, the wrestler a wrestler world World WWE it's because of my hat He wears gray cabbie hats like I do and has a red beard I don't think you look like him because of that were twinsies. So your nose isn't as big. Oh, thank you So anyway, I wore that and I was Sami Zayn for one day So but then the next day on Sunday, I did Brian from dream daddy who wears the green Hawaiian shirt I had a little pet corgi. They took her out on me. You're not quite that much of a bear Well, I'm getting I'm I'm not sure. I want Jamie to be like gay Categorizing me right now on olr. I we're not we're a show of non labels, okay You probably need another hundred on you. All right that well, I'm not sure whether to say thank you or not But Loki Loki, do you know the difference between a bear and a cub? Do you know I'm guessing its size? Yeah, or sometimes age age age, you know Bears or bears are big big men Harry usually big hairy men and I've obviously I'm you know No, not lacking in that department. But yeah, I'm I'm not big but I got fluff and stuff You're still younger gent. Yes, I guess I guess but I'm 39, honey At what age do I become a bear? 70 JD and chat says one day you'll be a daddy bear JD and chat says we ought to move on from this topic stop. He says how about a manther? My life heard man sir, but I kind of love it actually older gent version of the cougar I'm just like thinking of like I'm picturing welcome the orange tar with like, you know, like a panther body It's like the dude version of the cougar very fast yet awkward. You're Rob. What you're stiffers mom. What? Welcome to orange lounge radio rar. I'm your manthur in charge Rob Roberts now Rob's a furry There's nothing there's nothing wrong with furries. There's anything wrong with it. But now we know your fursona. I just you're the manthur I said there's nothing wrong first cuz I was about to follow that up with but I'm not a furry, you know. Mm-hmm. Yeah You heard it here first Rob's a manthur the white manthur I Hate everybody Well, it's it's really unfortunate that we couldn't make it to 700 but this is the end. Good night everybody All right, let's move on Dark soccer once tell us about another game a game that I am happy about and have been fucking waiting for two years for Do you hear me? What pumpkin man versus manthur? Oh Goddamn, I'm never gonna let that go now Who's who said that it's a stoppie stoppie stoppie should a trademark patent pending that shit And he we'd have to owe him a quarter every time we said it, but he didn't huh? so I Love my home stuck. I still love home stuck I have gone back and reread part of home stuck Even though it's like a rabbit hole that you can never get out of it's like a singularity of the Internet Well, we have a release date for hive swap Which is the game that was funded with like two million dollars on Kickstarter and So it is going to be a point-and-click Kind of adventure game that will not yell at you if you try to do these items will work together It has like a bajillion responses for many different things. You could do combinations of stuff So it's be really neat, but it's going to be out on September 14th. I am going to be playing the shit out of this game The music though is done by Toby Fox as an undertale who also did do stuff for Homestuck, so this is gonna be Megalovania came from Homestuck. So this is basically gonna be like the capital of meme. Yes okay, but you can play as a Couple of different characters in the The first part actually with the part one that comes out you play as Joey Claire Who is a teen girl trapped in her room in? 1994 or as Jude Harley who is her bizarre who is her kid brother trapped in his treehouse Or you can play as a couple of trolls But what happens basically they get switched from planet to planet so she goes to Alternia which is the troll planet and Troll boys come to earth There you go and much fanfic was written and there was much wank and Faye go to being drunk and and Juggalos taking over the government You know a bunch of people lost their shit because the whole juggalo March Happening at the same time in Washington DC is some drunk bullshit. Yeah, I heard yeah and But there were a lot of homestucks that were like, oh it happened in the comics it's happening for real man Cuz it did cuz juggalos took over the government Whatever I Have a reason to bust out the Ben Nye again JD and chat says fanfic and wank are two sides of the same coin. That is that is correct All right Anyhow, I might be making scale mates again. Just a few more stories for you guys in the classic game of the week Loki So there's been a lot of issues with Shadow of War The new Lord of the Rings game that's gonna be coming out pretty shortly so one of that has to do well with this kind of commemoration of one of the producers on the game executive producer Michael forgery and he Our 4g I guess is Anyways, he apparently died of cancer on March 3rd. And so with that they were going to do this kind of Memorialize them as a character in the game. So there is gonna be a character called fourth hog orc Slayer who kind of be like the like in fallout they have the The mysterious stranger that appears randomly and will kill your enemies for you so he would kind of appear and you know kill an orc for you or something in the game and It was gonna be offered as DLC at launch now in Most scenarios you would assume that okay. This is gonna be some free DLC This is kind of a way that they're you know honoring their new fellow You know employee and stuff friend or whatever But then they decided that they're gonna charge $4.99 for the DLC because this is fucking Warner Brothers, but hey That's alright because we're gonna be donating $3.50 of that $4.99 to the family which to be fair not unheard of because like blizzard has done pets for Wow that are 5050 for like make a wish or something like that Wasn't the first time something like that's been done and my assumption is that 350 is probably the cut they get After right the stores take their cut right so that that's fine to be fair. That's fine however There's fine print here as with a lot of things so the fine print that came under fire is well It's only valid actually in the United States so except for Alabama, Hawaii, Illinois Massachusetts, Mississippi and South Carolina Because apparently they have laws regarding fundraising and that type of thing and This DLC is not being sold just in the u.s.. It's being sold worldwide so They didn't come out and say that oh, we're gonna donate all the proceeds from like worldwide sales It's only for the sales that are in the US in these states that are not listed on this fine print So in a sense they are profiting from a dead person Okay, but didn't they come out on Twitter and say that's not like that They are not making any money off of this they said neither Warner Brothers interactive nor monolith will profit from any sales of Fort Hogg the orc slayer DLC regardless of the territory in which the DLC is sold so why can't we take that at face value? Why are we saying? Oh, they're profiting off? Why can't we just say okay? They can't advertise in these states because and You can't yes It is based off a law and I was when I saw this original story I was I was kind of floored that the law was not referenced in the story But there is it's not hard to Google you just Google those state names and charity law and there is a charity law that says Some states require what's called a CCV which is this whole split basically? Raising to register with the state Alabama, Massachusetts Specifically require bonds in the amounts of ten thousand dollars and twenty five thousand dollars respectively so in Massachusetts They would have to post a bond for twenty five thousand dollars to even do this fundraiser Well, they just do it in the way that we're gonna match the we're gonna match the sales of these DLCs in donation That way it's not tied to it. It's just them independently doing it You know and then they can do that with any state that would have been a way to get around that I would think or Just just they're gonna donate the money anyway wink wink nudge nudge. They just can't advertise it in these states They're doing what they're doing in these states keep themselves in the clear legally How much is not fucking charged for in the first place and just open up hey Well, we want to you know, we want to do something for this guy. We've opened up, you know It go fund me or something like that. You guys can donate to that. I again They've the idea of charity fundraisers and games through sales has kind of been done Like I said in Warcraft and there's other MMOs never been like controversial like this So that's the thing and I'll tell you actually actually I'm sorry but in Blizzard Yeah, because some people were like why only 50% going to make a wish Why why is Blizzard keeping the or Activision or whatever keeping the other 50%? So, I mean there it wasn't paying their designers and programmers, you know Well, it's the same with like humble bundle only a portion of that goes to these charities All right, I mean, I guess you could set it to be like the full thing but now granted there is also a difference between just general charity like in the sense of Make-a-wish or whatever. This is money that they weren't quote-unquote expecting or relying on or anything I think this is like it is literally a charitable donation But in this other case, like you said you have somebody who's passed that it might kind of I don't want to say Put a damper on the person's memory, but I think that's kind of the well conclusion I think you also here's the other reason why it's kind of skewing against them is because This is a game that everybody was looking forward to and then before this whole announcement because this is like the third announcement That they've made Regarding this game. The first one was oh, hey, by the way, you know that great single-player game that you have We're fucking put in loot boxes bitches. We're fucking put in loot boxes. And guess what? It's not just cosmetic shit It's fucking orcs and stuff stuff that you can get the aim basically pay the win. Oh, but don't worry It's not really pay the win because it's a single-player game Oh, but we got a multiplayer portion as well that you can use all this shit that you unlocked in your loot boxes And it's fucking like the whole meld your solid thing where they had, you know The bases that you would basically would be online and if they got attacked you could lose some of this stuff So it's basically this churning cycle of bullshit because they're fucking loot boxes. Once again a loot box They didn't need to be in a game Oh then by the way, we're gonna do also a fucking you know thing with Totino's pizza rolls because sure let's just do that and you can get codes and unlock shit and It's so it's all that greedy shit up front that's been in the headlines for the last few weeks and then this is like the fucking you know the end of it they announce this shit and it's like Really? You know, I mean you're charging for it. What the fuck? I mean, it's just it's a big mess I think there's better ways they could have done it and it doesn't help that this bullshit about their whole Blue box and DLC shit came out wait before all this happened Okay, you know you're getting some comments and chat over at live dog network calm stop He says in that case with what you're saying. Why do we need the DLC at all? Why can't gamers be generous to someone without expecting DLC in return? Exactly. I don't think they do you need to just say Say hey, you know what? We feel bad for this guy and his family We want to help out if you want to help out, you know, you you enjoy this game, you know think about you know Donating to you know his family with through this thing. This is how you can donate they get it done after a blog post done There's nothing that they need to do and then later on if they wanted to you know Because we really love this guy. We want to memorialize them, you know, we can put them in the game Like for example all those people that like played, you know in World of Warcraft and stuff that were hardcore of that and there's a few that died and became characters in the game They have fucking charge for DLC for that character. It was just something that they put in the game A lot of them are NPCs and statues exactly They're just NPCs or something like why did it have to be this big old playable character thing that you invested money on just like Why can't you do something nice to be nice instead of fucking charging for it? like I get I can will assume that your intentions were noble, but It just doesn't look good after you know, you're asking people to pay for money that shit was free before I just I Don't know it's not it just doesn't look good Bobby Blackwell and Chad says I probably wouldn't have donated straight like that for someone I never met but I probably would buy DLC like This so, you know another perspective. All right anyway in the interest of time. I'm gonna go ahead and move on Because we're already how far into the show are we like an hour and a half into the show and I already know a part A so in the interest of time, I'm gonna move on and I want to talk quickly about this one more here Another story that was submitted from our discord server about the Nintendo Wii. Yes that system from 2006 Apparently has infringed a Dallas inventors patent and a jury has awarded 10.1 million to this Dallas medical motion detection company I life is the name of the company who sued Nintendo in 2013 after they filed lawsuits In 2012 against four other companies it did go to trial in Dallas and the verdict found that Nintendo did infringe on the patent first filed in 1999 describing systems and methods for evaluating movement of a body Relative to an environment this 10.1 million was less than 10% of what I life's attorneys were asking for They wanted a hundred and forty four million That was how much the lawsuit was basically for at this point And of course Nintendo has said it will appeal the verdict the company told Glixel which is the Rolling Stones video game arm Nintendo disagrees with the decision as Nintendo does not infringe I life's patent and the patent is invalid Nintendo looks forward to raising those issues with the district court and with the court of appeals So don't expect Nintendo to write a check just yet But it is sure fascinated that this system came out over ten years ago. And here we are still arguing over patents I don't know the details of that patent but just sounding like it sounds like one of those patent roll pan patents that they have, you know, just I Don't know it to me and I know like in Texas. There's a there's a certain districts in there I'm not I don't think this is one of them that a lot of these patent troll cases go to yeah Sounds it sounds fishy, but Whatever they're gonna write it out until they get you know, they've got more money than this dude does I'm sure so yep Just bleed them dry they'll write it out And I think it's just more goes to show that and if it wasn't that case we would have had enough switches for holiday God, damn it Yeah, it's technically that technology existed in the Wii U is too as well didn't it? So Anyway, let's go back to a simpler time when patent trolls didn't exist Okay, maybe they did but I just like to think they didn't it's a simpler time when dark soccer is gonna walk into the gaming Vault and find a game that she thinks hey you little brats stop swinging your Wii around and Come play this game. Hey come into the sewer grate over here. I got a game for you to play It's the classic game of the week dark soccer. Oh, what is the classic game of the week this week? Excalibur 2097 the whole reason I picked this is because I went on like a 90s music rampage It was listening to a lot of psychosonic Which I loved psychosonic a whole lot when I was in early college and They did the soundtrack for the American version of this game. So in Japan, it was called sword maniac had a completely different soundtrack But in the u.s. It was called Excalibur 2097 had kind of a different story and the soundtrack was done by psychosonic Which if anyone bothered with anything about Mortal Kombat Annihilation They were one of the artists from that soundtrack Really just dance the electronic music really good stuff. Let me turn this up a little bit just for our listeners to hear This is actually the version of welcome to my mind Awesome anyway The game is also fairly interesting Basically you've got a big ton of different characters that are in this but it is It's notable for being a side-scrolling adventure game where at the same time though You Had your boss fights kind of turn it into a fighting game. It was pretty interesting But really I mean the biggest thing is notable is that either there was this involvement with a major with a major Band I should say at the time You feeling okay over there yeah, I am I'm trying to find something because one of my links I forgot to send you oh But it's okay a Couple of the things about it is that the art style in it was pretty dark But you had all kinds of just neat different characters You could you would pick up along the way, but you started off playing in the American version this someone named slash who basically went around to make peace and order of the world with his sword and And then You also could pick well. There's also like you rescued his partner Alex who was taken hostage and she then Like gets possessed and all kinds of stuff and there's all kinds of you know different characters in there you have to beat so It was a pretty neat game You know fairly average for side-scrolling, but I think it was the soundtrack that was the most notable thing about it, so there you go All right there. It is your classic game of the week Excalibur 2097 known as sword me sword mani sword mania X Mania X just kidding, but that's what it was called over in Japan play sword mania X You know what's funny is that in YouTube on that audio YouTube recommends the killer instinct theme as a related video And it's kind of because I actually kind of hear that whole like killer in so if you want to play just a few Seconds though of what the song came from Although if people listen to the show all the way through they'll Yes, I can hear it play a little bit of what inspired that here. Let's listen to oh My god ultimate dance party right there on the night Well that's not killer instinct, but yeah, it's still still that was that was like 1994 for me that's like the original song of what we heard in the other game, so yeah the Excalibur Yeah, all right, so so there you go sweet all right there. It is your classic Okay, game, but hey it's that whole era of cyberpunk game cyberpunk games, so I got you I got you all right We're gonna take a quick break though when we come back there is plenty more orange lounge radio to come including The emails that you guys submitted it to us as well as your phone calls at orange lounge Radio on Skype all one word.

But you know, I was out of town for a little bit anyway We have some late breaking news to get into tonight before we get into rapid-fire news Do I still have my special report break music? I think I have it here Let me see if we have our special report breaking news theme while news is shattering Yes a Breaking news on this Sunday just a few hours before we went live here at orange lounge radio a Incredibly popular youtuber who has over millions and millions of subscribers on YouTube He dropped the n-word while using a stream dot while doing a stream today His name is it Matt it's like p.u. I'm eating a pie or something like that. Oh, so Not the first time that man's mouth's gotten him into a little bit of trouble and you know Didn't even really apologize for it like the moment that it happened because it just man I debated if I should play the clip or not, and I'm not gonna because I don't want to promote this person but Just the way that that word just kind of just fell out of that guy's mouth when it really probably shouldn't be a part of his vocabulary is a little bit worrisome, especially with as many followers as he has and You know that people learn that behavior from somewhere, and you know what he's doing um And the way he kind of played it off He kind of did a little oh, sorry you know kind of like under his breath or whatever is kind of well It's kind of crap. Let's be real and again not the first time this guy has done something so I would also Like to know why do we keep making stupid people famous? You know what what is it about our culture that we keep because unfortunately this guy's Name was trending on Twitter after the incident which I yes I realized a lot of it was negative and so forth But it's like it's just so irritating to me because there's so many hard-working independent streamers And I'm not not even myself like I'm I'm fortunate to have more followers than some other people out there we're probably better at it than I am and And yet these people aren't the ones getting recognition. It's guys like this guy that are so I don't know when this guy's gonna get cancelled, but it didn't happen the last time I doubt it's gonna happen this time either. I don't know stop watching him I don't like the way he talks. I mean that that's what I wish people would stop doing Let's see Bob coffee and chat says shocking news racist little shit is a racist little shit mmm Kai's you don't chat says he did that before and got in trouble Yep, all right anyway Let's move on that was some late-breaking news Let's do some rapid-fire news and hopefully something a little more positive right Loki. Yeah, so this week They made an announcement regarding LA noir, which is like what? Rocks are what so LA noir is being remastered for the Nintendo switch PlayStation 4 and VR and it's not just one game, but actually three different games So LA noir the VR case files will be coming to the HTC vive and apparently it's gonna be Seven of the original cases from the LA noir game, and then they've of course adapted those for VR LA noir is gonna be coming to the switch with unique game features all additional content Joycon mode with gyroscopic and gesture based controls and in rumble and all that fun stuff And of course LA noir for PlayStation 4 and Xbox one It's gonna be remastered there have 4k for the PlayStation 4 Pro and Xbox 1x And yeah, and that's gonna be coming out Later, although I don't think they have a date on that yet. I never 14 I guess it's neat that it's coming to switch but that game's kind of old old blank I I hope that's not some freakin benchmark for Rockstar on how they can do on the switch because this isn't exactly the greatest litmus test to my well It's it's an okay title. Like it wasn't one I ever got into I Don't know. It's not as action-packed as like say a Red Dead Redemption or Grand Theft Auto It would be cool to see like a Grand Theft Auto 4 remaster or something like that come to the switch But yes, I think that's asking a little too much With those with that data problem that they're having fitting all that content on to you know cartridge Why don't they just do multiple cartridges, you know, like back in the room you probably have to switch back and forth It probably won't look so well expensive. Yeah, maybe I don't know what else Loki And then of course, I'm speaking of more remasters. This is more of a rumored port, but you know Bayonetta and Vanquish were just remastered on PC Well, the rumors are that it's gonna be coming to PlayStation 4 and Xbox one as well. So they haven't announced it yet, but Soon apparently there are some retail listings that have appeared for it. Oh my god, Loki Does this mean Bayonetta 2 and and here's the best part about it. It's a 2-pack. So it's actually gonna be both games together For 60 bucks. No, I'm just kidding We don't know we don't know how much yet, but probably probably not that much but there's rock start So I think Bayonetta on Steam is only what was it 15 bucks 20 bucks. It wasn't it wasn't 30 Yeah, so right now it's as expected in 2017 but I don't know it's It'd be interesting to see what happens with that and although I joke with Loki don't expect Bayonetta 2 again Nintendo You know, they may they may have a time thing on it Like it may be like after five years But I would assume that five years is the minimum on that sort of agreement when did Bayonetta 2 come out was it? 2015 at this point, so it's gonna see still got a few more years to wait Before something like that would happen. So anyway Moving on a story that you heard referenced in our introduction that actually also came from discord this week Thanks to you folks that use our discord over a vog network comm slash discord But apparently a new newly updated official Japanese language profile about Mario Has made it clear that he's retired from the world of plumbing. He is no longer a plumber The profile explains all-around sporty whether it's tennis or baseball soccer or car racing He does everything cool as a matter of fact He also seems to have worked as a plumber a long time ago Hence the past tense of worked now if you want to get technical back when Mario was known as jump man When he was in Donkey Kong, he was a carpenter in that game But you know, I know a lot of people that have worked several different types of jobs in their lives But it seems like Mario has retired from the world of plumbing My assumption would be that after all the times that he's rescued Princess Peach when you know, she's not helping herself out That she must be a sugar mama or something, right? He's got he's got he's getting some of that castle money some of that Mushroom Kingdom coin that happening. No. Yeah. All right I mean got it. It's easy to make the joke that he's Plumbed the princess but no Who cares I mean It's a really good question who fucking cares fucking cares. I mean, it's like I Do Loki I need the background for my fan. I can't enjoy this if I know that he's a plumber I don't like thing. So why he did play, you know He'll be he'll who gives a shit who gives a shit when his fucking Occupations because it never is once played into the game aside from the fact that he's in pipes and sewers and Jake He's a pipe and the movie Loki the movie a pipe in overall enthusiasts. Okay, he just likes that sort of shit He's an urban explorer. Let's make him like all Dark Sakura has your world been turned upside down by the news that Mario is no longer a plumber whoopty shit Brad from pod culture in our chat who by the way also celebrating a birthday today. So happy birthday, buddy Brad from bog cod Blah blah blah, maybe I could pronounce the fucking name on his birthday Brad from pod culture says Mario has laid enough pipe You Know Mario is huh? He's a fucking cold-hearted murderer is what he is because he just wow Indiscriminately kills all sorts of creatures in the Mushroom Kingdom and he trapped that poor gorilla And tried to electrocute his child. I mean, he's a fucking sociopath So that is what he fucking is Mario Mars a fucking asshole Oh, but we don't pay attention to all the death and murder. It's what is his occupation? I know that death death and murder is fine as long as he doesn't have sex better yet Since this came from Japan did his blood type change too? Because that is very important information. I need to know his blood type I need to know it Orange right in chat says he caused that turtle to bounce between those two pipes for eternity What about Luigi? Is he a plumber or is he now a ghost hunter because you know One of those a legitimate job one is not a legitimate job. I Mean, what's Luigi? Wow, everybody everybody in chat just fucking let it out when it comes to Mario fifth dream says he has a shitty mustache What about Waluigi and Wario? There's all these people that are not plumbers, but it sure is a hell a lot of fucking overalls and shit going on Maybe that's just the fashion in the mushroom. So if he's not a plumber Then he's just a guy that likes swimming in the fucking sewer He just loves diving down pipes of shit and jumping around the sewer And none of this makes any sense anymore Who thought it would be a good I mean, okay So I get it that he's not plumber now because honestly the guy's been taking quite the vacation from his job So that may probably got fired. He's like, well, he isn't he he's been missing for fucking decades now I'm assuming the guy's dead probably on a Meth binge or something like that. Who knows? Moving on Speaking of Mario shroom head just despite all your fucking issues with Mario. Everybody's suddenly venting Yeah, I always hated that guy. Fuck Mario. Everybody's just coming out and airing their grievances with Mario I know you're all still excited about Mario Odyssey. Don't fucking lie Mario Odyssey is coming out of course on the switch in October and some more information has come out including I guess the box art is out there now and Also some new kingdoms have been announced in the game so there's a video floating around there on the internet and you can check out some of the new kingdoms in the game as Well as a brand new move called the hip drop jump. That's right You jump in the air after doing a ground pound So you use the momentum you get from the ground pound to jump a little bit higher The princess is very familiar with this move the hip the hip drop jump After you do a ground pound you gotta jump over here Dar Sakura save me fucking porn star now man with all those kind of moves save me from this discussion. How about balls? No Pinball fx3 Is getting a release date. Whoo. It'll be out on September 26 for our PlayStation 4 Xbox one and PC and comes with the Universal Classics Set jaws back to the future and et Yay I can play pinball at home for real Yeah, but I like these I still like these RK because I think that's the new thing right 4k For is it 4k? Is it 4k? And there's also a demo out for a 16-bit version of Resident Evil for the Sega Megadrive slash Genesis Bobby black wolf and chat by the way saying not all of us can play it at home for real Start soccer. You're like dark soccer. You need to check your pinball privilege. You know what what people could just come to my house So Bobby's invited to your house Come on out Bobby. So he can't use that excuse anymore That sounds fair there's nothing wrong with this plan a little bit of an aside huh at coin up they have Lexi light speed No Lexi light speed is supposed to it's a prototype modular pinball table that has a Monitor built into the play field so you can reprogram the monitor and change out the modular parts and then make it a new game But just saying for folks in this area go to quite up and play Lexi light speed Bobby has also and he's talked about this on his show. He's moved into a new house That Is soon to be he will have that basement full of pinball stuff, so he's he's complaining now But later I don't think it's gonna be an issue And I still one of these days one of these days are sorry I will have my baby pac-man machine one of these days. We looked at one. Did you really it was like six grand? Six grand for baby pac-man for working fully shopped. Oh my god It can wear again pimple pimple prices have gone way up Like you could get a medieval madness for maybe five grand Eight nine now Wow seriously all right on the anyway a 16-bit Resident Evil blah blah blah in the meantime pinball FX will work That was the other story, but that was it that was it 16-bit Resident Evil blah blah cares pinball Rob we need to do the pinball cast I'm not as a pinball as you are it needs to be called look at my balls I'll call it that why not shiny balls I Think I think you should find another surely there are other female pinball enthusiasts out there You should all band together and do a cast a lady cast a lady called look at my balls Show of hands in chat would you listen to a lady pinball cast called look at my balls? Look at my shiny balls They would they'd listen to it ever since you were young boy. Did you play the silver ball? It only works if you sing it it doesn't it doesn't work right if you just recite it all right So just just just to say the website doing that Resident Evil 16-bit PS CD. Are you? To visit those types of places at your own risk, but There's a demo for the Sega Mega Drive slash Genesis of basically a remake of Resident Evil But in 16-bit, I thought you would have been into that dark Sakura, but you got distracted by pin I got distracted by balls all right by the way balls some comments in chat Brad says best name ever Let's see Brad also says fuck. Yes, that's two and I'm at says yes for three says yes Rage Nader says sign me up come on Noel Gus says sounds like Manthur daddy needs a sugar daddy When it comes to my baby Batman machine Why now do I have Hedvig in my head? Oh my god? I got a Tangent time I got a snapchat from our pal Victoria who has she ever been on this show Maybe once like a long time ago, cuz she doesn't really play a lot of game. Well. She'll tell you she's now the cosplay Queen Okay, she'll tell you she doesn't play video games But then she'll be like I just ran an all-female D&D campaign where we do I'm like bitch you play games you play games up. Yeah, so anyway um But she sent me a snap she was watching Hedwig earlier today and exposing one of her friends to it And if you've never seen this movie called Hedwig is a good word for it It's it's like one of the greatest movies one of my absolute favorite movies ever It's a few years old at this point, and they did a Broadway revival that was well known with Neil Patrick Harris But the movie is great too, so that was my tangent. Thank you very much All right Bobby black wolf and chat says I write an actual factual thing that's neat about pinball fx3 and it gets ignored for man They're baby. Oh hi this must be your first episode of orange launch radio welcome to the show as I mentioned We're three friends that all met playing DDR fine. Here's the comment Blackwell says the great thing about pinball fx3 is that they have a game mode that actually teaches you the way to play Proper pinball today as in how to do the objectives and stuff Keep the ball in play as long as possible ball flips that's right All right if anyone wants to see a really good multi ball run I did put video up of Dan playing cactus Canyon continued And you don't always hit both flippers at the same time. That's a total fucking noob move You hit one or the other maybe once in a while you hit both But two rules right now what look at the layout of the field and don't play the Simpsons pinball party at the ball bolt If there are two things I know about bit ball that could be the first episode there's two things I know look we're gonna talk about my two balls my two big balls right at the top of the show Number one look at the play field number two don't play Simpsons party at the bolt now I know that may be low-hanging balls there Good first topic Y'all are on fire tonight, what's that we take a week off Should the show move to every other week because we're funnier after we have a week off or anyway Let's get to what is in stores this week travel around the world.

There's two by the same person. Oh all right two it is Okay, oh no, I think I already read this one I thought I did you might have I feel like one is a follow-up to the other yeah I think one's a follow-up to the other read the follow-up delete deleted I Got my Raspberry Pi in case a few days after the first email I wrote it was really easy to set up only took a few hours now I have a mini classic system the place way more than 30 games actually about 200 times more So far with a lot of room for another few thousand. I've been enjoying some other three a couple of Metroid games I missed in the past and some gamer 80d fueled random classic arcade game sessions I just thought I'd let you guys know it was up and running I encourage anyone who missed out on Nintendo's minis or anyone who does love classic games to give it a go and put one of These together themselves. They're great. Thanks again fifth dream By the way fifth dreams in chat right now saying we never did read the original email It must it must have come in the week that we were gone So well, I look I've actually been following his saga a little bit on Twitter and Facebook I'm sure I did cuz I was like, but I have one But anyway, well, we'll summarize a little bit. So it's quick. I'll read it. Okay. Okay. Hope you guys did it I hope you're proud of yourselves. You finally pushed me over the edge to purchase a Raspberry Pi kit to make a classic gaming rig I really wanted the NES classic the games on it were great and it was worth the price to get the games officially and legally But of course, I couldn't obtain one. I'm I'm mildly considered a Raspberry Pi but never bothered I wasn't really interested in this NES classic and after hearing the effery effery involving that system too and The discussion of last episode you guys convinced me to look into the pie is an alternative for easy retro gaming on my TV It doesn't seem too complicated and I have a little extra money at the moment So I went for it as an actual if you did intend to cue the F you music I also you don't have to Rob. I also had it ready to go. I had it ready to go. I Also purchased a case for it that looks like a mini nest if Nintendo won't let me buy the thing from them I'll have to go ahead and make my own Anyway, thanks guys for inspiring me to take the plunge and do this soon. I'll be gaming like it's 1985 I'm a brand new homemade classic system fifth dream. Don't blame me. I Bought one I I think it would have been great if Nintendo would have made enough of them So you didn't feel you had to turn to this route, but seeing as they didn't and you did I'm glad to hear it's running. Well, I'm glad it's working for you, but I Don't know I have I've got ever drive So as long as you as long as you did that put the guardian legend on it for me, bro Put the guardian ledges you put the guardian legend on it for three Did you see speaking of the guardian legend and I should have fucking brought this up There is an alpha build of a guardian legend kind of remix Oh, yes. I saw it floating around your Facebook. I think actually yeah I'm chatted with one of the testers of it over YouTube and I'm actually pretty pretty impressed with it I haven't had a chance to sit down and play it yet. Just given, you know work and everything especially next week But I I have it downloaded and the music is really good it looks like it's got some preliminary issues with collision detection and Tweaking the difficulty level some but it's an early fan made game. It's gonna have it looks really good. That's great All right, too bad that franchise can't seem to live on officially. I want the guys saying it compile I want the guys who made blaster master zero to get their hands on this Like who do I have to blow to make that happen the entirety of compile? Line them up all three people left for the company line them up All right Anyway That's it for the mailbag if you want to send us an email for a future week participate at orange lounge radio.com We do have some more news stories for you guys, and then we're gonna open up the skype line Yes, Skype is back tonight. Yay Orange lounge radio all one word on Skype Loki you first though alright, so Let's talk a little bit about YouTube again Unfortunately, so there's a whole csgo gambling foot of fiasco I guess with these different independent run gambling sites that basically allowed you to bet on our Different like loot boxes and stuff and all that so the the problem was that there's these two guys a Trevor Martin or a T T Martin and Thomas syndicate castle who were running These sites and they were also promoting them on their YouTube channels But not necessarily showing that they you know that disclosing that they own these sites in fact They even faked videos showing that oh, yeah, they're winning all this valuable loot and basically kind of promoting this stuff So they did run afoul with the FTC However, there was no penalty because FTC said it normally can't find defendants for a first offense however, it did say that they could face up to More than 40,000 per violation if they fail to clearly and conspicuously disclose any future activity Of course a lot of people aren't too happy about that because they feel that these guys have already deceived Quite a few people, but I guess they get a warning for now, and hopefully they discontinue their activities You've been warned you've been given a stern warning don't do it again Even though you write millions of dollars on this don't do it anymore Right So moving over to Nintendo and something that I think a lot of us have been asking Nintendo for for some time not everybody Though to be fair is an achievement system on Nintendo's console obviously You know Xbox the 360 and one have the achievement points system The Sony PlayStation has the trophy thing, but Nintendo systems don't have anything at least not for now What's kind of interesting is that there was a ask me anything that happened this past week and one of the developers? From crunching koalas was doing an ask me anything over the Nintendo switch game at licked spear I hope I said that right now apparently as part of this AMA He may have let it slip that there is actually an achievement system coming out See I'm trying to find the specific quote here in the AMA thread where it is He said That Sorry I didn't have it up as soon as I was ready to go to the story here I here we go so he was responding to somebody who asked does your game have online rankings and he replied and said Nintendo doesn't have an official support for achievements and leaderboards like Sony or Microsoft, but we know that they're working on it We'll see how it goes and we'll add the rankings along the way Also the game has multiple levels game modes difficulty levels etc etc so he said we know they're working on it now Could this be that this is something that's about to get unveiled when Nintendo wants your money? It's the first time ever that achievements have been brought to consoles Nintendo is such an innovator well They could put I I said this a long time ago Is that Nintendo could do it like coins and you could actually like you get coins when you do stuff in games? I guess this is kind of like the mind Nintendo system But then you could actually use those coins for dinky rewards or maybe heck tie it into the mind Nintendo system Why not me Tomo I remember that was one of the big reasons to play me Tomo is you actually got coins From doing stuff that you could buy like it was really it was mostly dippy stuff It was like backgrounds and 3ds themes You know, but but it's still something and I think at one point they gave away like for a thousand of those coins You could get p-cross Zelda version of 3ds like there was actual like games you could get now see it Yes, Nintendo actually would be groundbreaking if they did stuff like that I'm not gonna hold my breath, but even a basic achievement system would be more than they've got now. I Agree with you. However however Microsoft used to do that with the Xbox achievements where certain achievements would unlock stuff for your Avatars, all right movie and stuff. So it's been done Okay, that's true, but I'm sure they would like to tout themselves as groundbreaking with some stupid shit like that Yes, I mean, but I also realize not everybody out there is into the achievement thing and that's cool But I think Nintendo has such a rich catalog Especially if they are gonna go back if they're gonna go back and update 8-bit games like balloon fight Let's say to play online then if they're gonna be in there having to update it to do online Anyway, then why not sneak in some achievements while you're at it I mean, I realize this is not something that could be done for the entire catalog, but you know some of your biggest classics Why not? I don't know. Yeah, we'll see Oh rage nator says I can you buy stuff with you play achievements, too That is true. You play has that actually Pretty useful. Yeah, you can get like dance remixes and just dance and things like that. All right, so I use it I use why did use it for South Park Oh Costume unlocks, right? Okay. Well, maybe okay, so Nintendo wouldn't necessarily be innovative in this department, but it would be Nintendo So you all wouldn't care trust Dark saga. What do you have for us? Well, it's a little tiny bone thrown out to to Silent Hill fans, but in an interview A Kiriyama Oka was saying that he would love to work on another Silent Hill title if the series was revived and he said Several times that he really wanted to work on another Silent Hill game It was mentioned at gamescom. He said I am NOT against it, but it's hard to say Because everyone has evolved and maybe the mindset has changed as well so At least we know we can count on somebody for Silent Hill Well, I guess if a Bomberman revival happened any and DDR still chugging along over there Konami anything's possible But I'm just not gonna hold my breath. I'm not gonna get my hopes up over anything Yeah, I still need to watch that Castlevania anime though. I just So much to do so little time to do it when I need to nap. I Was I was too busy watching the Twin Peaks revival I don't know. I don't know what I'm gonna do tonight after my live stream There's no more Twin Peaks revival to watch it ended last week Did you know that and I had to wait I had to wait till Monday to see it I had to avoid Twitter for 24 hours because I was worried about being spoiled. Oops. I know I know Sacrifices, I know the sacrifices I make my eyes hurt now anyway from rolling But I will give a shout out to John from critical myth because he wrote a great review of the finale on our website vog network.com there. He has the whole little section there and him and his staff for the TV reviews and He did a great one for the Twin Peaks finale. It's filled with spoilers So don't read it unless you unless you never plan to watch it or you don't care about Probably watch it then cuz I'm not gonna watch it. Yeah, but he did a really good review I thought so good. I just want to give I just want to give props where props is due. All right And act deft and chat says spoilers it ends I don't know if that's true anyway Loki what do you have for us? All right, so apparently steam has been blocked in Malaysia And the reason it was blocked is because there's this game that's actually on steam right now Called fight of the gods and so it's an early access and basically stars different god type characters From different Mythologies fighting against each other. So you have Jesus Christ versus Zeus versus Odin versus This doesn't sound controversial whatsoever. And they also have like Moses and wait, isn't this right? Huh? Isn't this might you're describing? I don't know. It's a joke. It's a joke. But yeah, it looks like it's a silly fighting game but of course, you know they took offense to it because You know Jesus in a fighting game is offensive to some people yes. Yes. Yeah, so basically yeah, I Like there They have like I guess they're saying that His fight introduction and there's a voice-over result. I'm back for the people He rips his himself off the cross and uses like I guess some of the blocks of wood still You know nailed to his hands as weapons Wow Well, you know what Hey people are free to make whatever game they want sounds I mean the game itself I mean, it's not you know, it's still very early. It's rough Bobby black wolf says in chat the trailer says he's back and he's cross Okay Anyhow Yeah, some country some countries don't appreciate that type of stuff. So if he really wants to piss people off He'll put the Prophet Muhammad in there, too Don't go there. All right Moving on one more story JD says Bobby real really nailed that one and Bobby's like no I'm not kidding. Like that wasn't a joke. That was really really in the trailer. All right Moving on one more story for you guys tonight our last story tonight, and I hope there is a particular listener of ours That's paying attention to this story that I'm about to talk about because I don't bring this game up very often on the show But I felt it was worthy to bring up tonight Magic the gathering that's right Wizards of the coast unveiled this week magic the gathering arena. It's a free-to-play title So I think this listener it's like two favorite things combined magic the gathering and free So it's a free-to-play title and it's being made by digital games studio If you would like you can get in the closed beta, which you can get into a magic wizards calm Slash en slash MTG arena or you can probably google it and you'll find it that way The game is targeting a PC release, but they're looking to do other platforms as well The beta is going to start with constructed play where you can build decks using all 279 cards from the upcoming expansion set I Shall on am I saying that right? It's I X a la n but I think when you have an X in that context between two vowels is the noise, right? I think each along draft draft and ranked constructed are coming later the goal for launch to include all standard legal magic cards The focused of the arena game will be on the newest cards and game mode because of this We know that magic online which is a library of nearly every card ever printed from the game's entire history Will continue to offer experiences to players that are unique to magic online Development on magic online will continue with new card sets new updates and ongoing tournaments So you there's both games that are going to be covered there They are trying to go after live streaming with this and they are hoping that MTG arena will be one of the most viewed streams On twitch and I gotta say looking at the layout of this game they definitely know some of the things that work well with Hearthstone because um I'm kind of reminded of it. But to be fair Hearthstone owes a lot to magic the gathering as well So it's kind of neat that how these two games have kind of helped each other out. So imagine the gathering arena I like the free Portion of that that definitely is motivating to check that out. So check that out Alright, we're gonna open up the skype line right now orange lounge radio all one word on skype and by the way, if you didn't catch the reference their rage inator who calls into this show likes free games and Often talks about magic the gathering So if you didn't catch the joke just just you know I just wanna explain it for you guys one of our frequent caller If you want to be a frequent caller or a first-time caller orange lounge radio all one word on skype and sure enough Wow, it's lighting up right now. So let's get to it. We have some calls coming in coming in We're gonna start with this one higher on orange launch radio. Who's this? Hey, what's going on? Everyone? It's Ron Hey Rama, good to talk to you. How are you? I'm good. I'm relaxing. I've done all my adult chores I'm kicking back with an adult beverage. Good job. You adulthood do something adult. Mm-hmm. All right, what's on your mind, buddy? Well first things first, you know, I totally forgot about Metroid coming out. I know bad gamer bad gamer. It's so there's a lot happening. So it's okay I am so I'm trying to track down a copy of the Deluxe the deluxe edition. I'm hoping that target pulls through for me on this Yeah Yeah, you know what? I couldn't find a deluxe edition either So I just I ended up ordering the regular one because I don't think there was that big a difference between the deluxe and the Regular I think it's extra because of the CD soundtrack is some other stuff. If anything I just go to a GameStop You know how they do know Yeah, they'll just kind of like be like, alright here you go. If we don't we didn't sell them all or whatever There you go. But um, this is something I want to call in and talk about real quick I don't know. This has been this has been talked about but this is my theory on the whole Microsoft Sony Nintendo cross-platform gaming thing We haven't talked about it tonight but this has definitely come up in previous episodes, especially when games like rocket league come up and I think Specifically that one because of the fact that rocket league will be out on Nintendo platforms before the end of the year So what are your thoughts? Oh First things first now when you play on Xbox Live, those are centralized Microsoft servers They handle all of that first party third party. They handle all of that. Yep This is the main reason why you can't PC play whereas on PC the third party companies handle their own servers and Also when it comes to Sony you connect to their central servers first before you go out to the PC servers now for Unified play you would need a Microsoft account. It's what whatever email address you use to log in with Xbox Live That's your Microsoft account So you could tie that to your Nintendo account and if you notice on various sites You could tie your Nintendo account to your Facebook account your Google account, whatever That that's all said and good and I believe that is the main reason why Sony does not want to play with Nintendo like that Because they don't want people tying their Sony IDs to the Microsoft accounts I feel that they don't want Sony they don't want Microsoft to deal with the services. They can't handling everything You know what I'm saying? Yeah my game my rules, but isn't it interesting that Final Fantasy 14 exists now granted. It's not on Xbox one, but it's Sony and PC cross play true But when I'm just saying when that time comes when it comes out on on Xbox one We will not be able to play together because that's separate separate centralized servers unless Sony or square whoever decide to you know, let's try to make this work Well square is flat-out said if they won't do that, then they're not releasing it done They're not gonna release on Xbox unless they drop that whole thing. And that's what it is. That's that Microsoft is not gonna let that happen But yet well they but they did with Final Fantasy 11 which was cross play between Xbox 360 and PlayStation 2 granted I know that was years ago, but it is still an example of they can make it work true Maybe my theory is it worked. Well, but probably higher up. So Microsoft will just wasn't feeling it Maybe it was a deal. Maybe I don't know it was absolutely it was absolutely deal It was we want square on Microsoft platform. So fucking badly. We will do anything Oh, how about our MMO that we could make more money off of with your platform that caters to the America audience How about that? And yep. Okay. Sounds good. Yep. Great MMO 360 Let's do it and they didn't give a fuck about the PC and PlayStation element because they finally got a square release on their console That's why I did it and I think with with FF 11 once you connected the Microsoft servers You bounced off to the square servers to play Yes, which ironically play online at the time play online doesn't really exist anymore at least not in that form but Play online was a joint venture between Square and Sony. So you were it was like you were using a Sony service on your Xbox 360 I'm stretching it a little bit But still it's it's not the type of thing that would exist today and it's weird to think that just what God that was what? Treasures of Otter gone was maybe a 2008 release. This wasn't a horrifically long time ago pretty much. Yeah They could make it work if they want to well my isn't minecraft. Haven't they also said that minecraft will be playable between It's basically everything but Sony. Yeah, cuz it's pretty much When when Microsoft when it comes out for the switch You're gonna be connecting to Microsoft servers logging in with a Microsoft account to keep it all together Because the majority of players are pretty much PC Xbox and you play on the PC you're logging in with your Microsoft account there or if you if you if you've been playing micro for a long time and You get it for the switch and you see a login says log with your Microsoft account that person will be like, oh easy I don't have to create no new account. No, I could just jump right in and play. Yep Yeah It's gonna be interesting but you know people people don't seem to be threatened by Nintendo when it comes to the online space fancy that Cuz nobody's ever like fu Nintendo. You can't join in on this Well, usually it's Nintendo your system is incapable of joining in on this but with the switch some of that seems to be changing I guess between rocket League and minecraft and whatever else Slowly, but surely but I am getting impressed by the switch. Am I getting one? Not just yet. I'm still waiting. Will you be able to get one when you want one thoughts and prayers? Something like that, but I will say this The next my next console will be an Xbox one. Will it be an S or an X? We will see as the holidays come down Might also depend on is crackdown 3 out yet, right? Yeah And like I said, the only reason why I'm getting an Xbox one as as you've always said it's the golden rule of games It's the only reason why my first next-gen console at time was an Xbox 360 that console has all the games I will sit there and play the fuck out of yes, sir. That's the most important if it has the games you want Absolutely. All right, my friend. I'm gonna let you go to see if we get any more calls but thank you as always for the call and Everybody should check out anime jam session, even if none of you went to Dragon Con No, but what one of my staffers it you go. She did go and I told her to find you that weekend Go down to the podcasting tracks find a vlog staff Give Rob a hug. Oh, I I did not run into her sadly, but Dragon Con is a huge 80,000 people this year She's quite a precious little cinnamon roll. Well, there's always next year cuz we I will be back next year Might just see a unlockable character come down next year Oh, I miss actually I think I'm allowed to say this because I think has he said it on Twitter All right, maybe I'll get in trouble, but I'm gonna say it anyway, my understanding is that Travis Donovan's back next year and This is a this is a big fucking deal. Just see so I so I heard I think we need to get the all of Bob Together, you know if we're gonna do it we're gonna do it up Yeah, hell yeah who wants to get Raven and EJ plane tickets? Get girls gone Wow represented and Dark Sakura, I know I you I've been begging you to come to Dragon Con. I don't have money I know I know it's it's something you got to save and plan for it's shall I make a go fund me I will throw money towards it We'll see. All right Alright, I'm gonna let you go to get more calls. But thank you so much for the call. No problem. Stay fabulous Rob Thank you. Stay stay stay Stay safe Well, I'm trying to think of something new to tell you Okay, I thought you was trying not to say to because you might be offensive you forget I'm the hardest person to offend in this world. No, no stay black is the longest-running joke in all our history I'm just trying to we're coming up on episode 700 Rama. We got to we got to innovate a little bit here. I Guess you say stay we bitch or whatever because you know, that's how I am. I'm idle trash. Weeb trash. Whatever. No, I got it I got it. Stay drunk All right, take care buddy Bye Alright Bobby Blackwell says stay plumbing because he's no longer a plumber because he dresses as Luigi I like that that was good orange lounge radio all one word on Skype light before I take another call here Um any last-minute stories we want to get out Loki. Yes There's a rumor that the 2018 Call of Duty game is gonna be set in the modern setting The reason for that is because Treyarch has a job posting for some, you know Combat designer with triple-a competitive shooter experience deep knowledge of firearms and modern military Technology and you also have to be prestige one or above in black ops 3 multiplayer. So maybe another modern warfare game Let's just hope it's not North Korea cuz I might hit a little close to home right now with all that's going on in The world just saying IJS Let's get to another call. Hello. You're on orange launch radio. Who's this? Hi Hi, this is Regenator. Hey, Regenator. What's up, buddy? I You know, I can't hear me we can hear you. Can you hear us? Oh, yeah Sorry, I thought I hit the mute button for whatever reason. That's all right. Yeah, what's on your mind tonight, buddy? Well, you know, I heard a certain someone say my two favorite words free in magic Yeah Yeah, no, I figure you know when If you mention it, but do you know when this the magic arena is coming out? I don't think they've announced a date my assumption is that most this kind of stuff you usually want to get out by holiday, but free to play games are usually kind of held to a different standard because you know They it's supposed to be like kind of ongoing continuous income So, you know You would hope that something like this if they're trying to target the mobile market would try to be out by the time that Apple's new devices are out which you know times running out because they're likely to announce new phones next week And what it's usually only about two weeks after the announcement for those bad boys come out. So But I don't think it's gonna be that fast with the fact that they're trying to do this whole beta. So Hell for all we know it could be next spring before this thing is out It just really depends on what the developers want to do Well, I just hope this comes to steam cuz now he is anyone on my friends list gonna Test ooh, I played the ever-living crap out of the previous magic the gallery games. I mean collectively I may put Good news rage in our houses and say PC is what they're targeting. So they're not even really actually targeting right now The the actual mobile market PC's what they're targeting. They haven't said steam per se, but does it matter? Yeah, really exactly. That's what I thought. That's like as long as this PC somewhere. I think you're gonna be okay Yeah, no for the main reason that I was gonna initially call before you even brought up magic the gallery. Sure No You know, it's a safe to say that the three of you are at least somewhat familiar with the RPG maker series available Available. Oh, sorry. I know I'm familiar with it RPG maker you guys you guys probably all know it I mean, I've seen it in yeah, I just didn't have Patience for it as I say I was gonna ask if any of you guys have ever used it I'm aware of a long time ago. Okay, so I never have like I I probably picked it up in a humble thing at some Way, but I've played things that were a result of that because I believe to the moon was out of that Yeah that RPG maker right? So I've seen what it can do. Let's put it that way So that's about my familiarity with it. But have I done a game in it? No All right. Well, I The main reason I'm big enough is I got two questions regarding that um first now hypothetically speaking now if I were to Make it make a game, you know be a decent game or crappy one And would I be you know legally allowed to let's say hand it off to So I involved a lot to play with that No, and be if I would do that dude, they you know, where'd they be able to play the game? Just with the file itself that I make or where they need the actual RPG maker software to actually write them like using like For like a better almost like every later Okay, my assumption and chats gonna have to help me out here because I'm not familiar enough with the RPG maker But my assumption is that there's probably like a really cheap version that would allow you to make games But not really publish them and then there's probably a more expensive version that does allow you to publish them where you can run the exe is independently now obviously RPG maker has to have some sort of functionality like that somewhere because we've seen games like to the Moon come out as opposed to how much does it cost to make something like that? That's the part I'm not sure of okay Bobby says RPG maker has a binary on PC so you can distribute the game So whatever it is that you make you would be able to distribute on PC and you'd have to kind of carefully read the license Agreement, I don't know what you're allowed to sell and so forth But if you're gonna give it to a friend That you know through vog or something that are posted on our discord for people to freely download or something I think that's actually encouraged like RPG maker like wants you to do that That's what it's for like it would kind of be stupid if you built this whole game Then you couldn't share it with somebody so I think usually the sticky situations get into but then you profit off it And I'm not sure what happens from there I'd have to see the license agreement a little more carefully with that But yeah, if you want to just design something for friends to play like that's that's what the shit is for Absolutely do it. Oh, oh, all right. That's great cuz no, no, I Honestly picked up one of the versions of RPG maker from humble bundles some time ago I haven't really touched yet, but I've been thinking of doing something now With it throwing a whole bunch of vog references in it like what you did with the head off one Thing you did for typing up the dead. No, like put in Quotes and like they're like have a character like Bobby. They were mentioned No, VR, you know have another character they would say Yeah, we checked off, you know reject false icons stuff like that No, you want it you want to do a vog parody RPG of some sort? Basically, yeah. Well, I'm flattered But here's here's my honest suggestion to you with all that and this is the total opposite of what Loki does but listen to me Don't start off with your most ambitious project I would say what you need to start with since I know you love dick and fart jokes make a five-minute fart joke RPG Just so you can get in there and do it and make something and feel like you've accomplished something Because if you try to take on the most ambitious project first, you'll probably never finish it Well, honestly, I can't work here just yet cuz Frankly, I've been PC issues. I won't get into that here. But once I get that resolved I'll start working on and chances are once it all that is being said and done chances are I'll give my project down long before time to car comes out Say sorry Loki had to throw that shit out By the way, Bobby black will found you might want to link us to the website You got this from to Bobby, but he did find this whole can I sell my games created with RPG maker? Thank you for doing the research. I Couldn't do because I'm trying to talk to Our caller but can I sell my games? The answer is yes You can distribute games you created with RPG maker or IG maker using its included or add-on materials as freeware or commercial wear You're also add allowed to modify the materials with other software like Photoshop provided They are only used within RPG maker or IG maker software and not sold or distributed So anyway, Bobby linked an FAQ to you check it out and read it and I think all your concerns will be resolved All right, cool, thanks, I'll definitely walk into that you're welcome anybody listening podcast who's curious It's all part of their official website RPG maker web.com Well, thanks again, and I guess I'll clear up the line just in case act after someone else wants to call him no worries But have a nice night though. You too. Good luck with your game. See ya. Yep. Yep. Bye. Bye You know, I seem to remember years ago and I feel terrible because I forget the listeners name But he stopped listening some time ago. He made like a text adventure RPG Do you remember that somebody made a text adventure RPG? We actually had it on the olr website for a time and I played it and it was cute It wasn't even it wasn't even done in like twine because this show is so fucking old. I don't think twine existed yet Yeah, I just looked now Apparently I've gotten in a few of those RPG maker bundles because I have 2003 and VX ace. Yeah Yeah, I'm pretty I'm pretty sure at some point I would have picked one up to have like a game guru like his game Guru is like the shittiest like build your own game engine like a lot of shit. I mean, it's just shit Yeah, but you can make a first-person shooter game with it, but it'll be shit Should we do should we do an RPG maker game jam at some point? Sounds like a lot of hard that it's complicated. All right listeners Tell me RPGs are probably the hardest thing to make because they're very complicated Yeah, Bobby Black Wolf and chats is what we need to have another game jam. I actually yes, we do need another game I feel a little more encouraged or something like RPG maker than I do like or we could do like Would you do what like what they do down here in Sacramento with the IGDA is the progressive game jam? Well, it's a longer period of time like that you work on shit I bet you if we did want to actually do another game jam I bet those guys would support us a thousand percent. I bet they would it's like I would totally get in on their progressive game Jam stuff because that way I think we've been more motivating because you're with other people The problem is I can't meet every Saturday or yeah I'll I think they meet one Saturday a month, which isn't so bad But it's hard enough for me to get away from the house. So I Yeah, I get it. I get it. I would love to do something like that. I want to be motivated It's just it's hard like this week like actually the last two weeks It's been car shopping just car shopping car shopping car shopping. So that was Unfortunately, what's been taking up my time there? All right. Well, I think the I think the Skypline is dying.
