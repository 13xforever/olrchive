00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,120
This week Good Ol' Games continues its improvements by providing universal cloud save support

2
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:21,280
to every game they sell without the games needing updates to support it.

3
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:24,560
This is just one bonus to delight gamers and we have much more to tell you about starting

4
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:28,480
right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

5
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:35,000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,680
where every gamer has a voice.

7
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:43,560
It is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight with episode number 681 for this March 26th of

8
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:45,080
2017.

9
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:51,460
My name is Rob Roberts joining you every week here at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com

10
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:55,420
Sunday nights at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf

11
00:00:55,420 --> 00:01:01,540
show and if you are listening live you can join us in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.

12
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:04,620
Just a quick note for the live listeners, our website has been acting a little funky

13
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:07,060
today because they've been doing some maintenance.

14
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:10,700
So I've been trying to make the show live so y'all can check in because if you didn't

15
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:14,300
know you can do that, you can actually check in over at vognetwork.com and you get points

16
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:19,300
for listening to the show and same thing on the podcast if you're not able to be here

17
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:22,660
live because you got something else going on Sunday nights, you can listen on the podcast

18
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:25,980
feed, there will be a little interruption somewhere in the show and then Jason comes

19
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:30,020
on and says to register participation use this pass phrase and he'll tell you what

20
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:33,180
it is and you just go type it at the main page of vognetwork.com and you get the same

21
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:37,220
check in all the live people get, same same, so don't say we don't love you podcasters

22
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:42,260
but the website's acting funky, I can't turn it live although it just came up as

23
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:45,400
I've been ranting here so maybe it was just one of those little hiccups while they've

24
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,660
been doing maintenance.

25
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:51,260
So while I mess with that, I should turn over here to my right and introduce Techmaster

26
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:52,900
Loki joining me in the studio.

27
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:53,900
Hello.

28
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:54,900
Hi Loki, how are you?

29
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:55,900
I have food in my mouth.

30
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:56,900
Yeah, great, great.

31
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:58,940
So we got all these radio problems going on, we got a busted website.

32
00:01:58,940 --> 00:01:59,940
That's alright.

33
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:00,940
You're trying to talk with your mouth full.

34
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:01,940
Well, how are you, Loki?

35
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:02,940
I'm doing fine.

36
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:04,340
So you were telling me about a trip to the movies?

37
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:08,380
Yeah, I went and saw Lego Batman yesterday because I wanted to take my son to go see

38
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:12,340
it because my wife doesn't want to go see it and he always likes to go in the movie

39
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:13,340
for years.

40
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:14,340
So we went and saw that yesterday.

41
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:20,460
And it was fucking awesome because it's the Lego movies and the Lego movies are just fantastic.

42
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:25,900
It was kind of cool about Lego Batman though, minor spoilers I guess.

43
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:30,540
There's a lot of different villains from different movie series that come out in this

44
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:35,080
because they go to the Phantom Zone and pull all these bad guys.

45
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:41,100
So it feels a lot like Lego Dimensions the movie if they were going to do that.

46
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:45,140
Mine is, of course, you know, Wild Cell and Gandalf and all that shit that are normally

47
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:47,060
in the Lego Dimensions game.

48
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:49,380
But they've got a lot of humor in it.

49
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:53,400
It's just really funny, especially if you've watched all the other Batman movies because

50
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:58,180
they make lots of references to stuff that happened in those and it was pretty awesome.

51
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:00,980
That's funny that you went to the movies because you guys know, and I talk about this on the

52
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:02,720
show, I never get to movies anymore, right?

53
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,640
So I did get dragged to the movies this weekend.

54
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:10,580
So my buddy, Shane, who comes on this show a lot and hosts another show here on the network,

55
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:15,340
Power Ranger Pridecast, obviously he's very hyped about the Power Rangers movie.

56
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:17,160
So he dragged me to go see that.

57
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:20,560
In the fancy new theaters in Sacramento, and if you happen to be a local person, you know

58
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:24,420
exactly which theaters I'm talking about, they tore down what we used to call the boobies

59
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:27,420
because there were these big dome theaters that you could see from miles away and they

60
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:28,420
were the boobies, right?

61
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:35,340
So they tore down the boobies, they're gone, and then they put this large, very, it's just

62
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:38,540
a very rectangular plane building now, it's not as exciting.

63
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:43,760
But inside, it's super exciting because it has like the recliner seats that full recline,

64
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:47,320
like I'm talking like Lazy Boys where you put your feet up and all this stuff, which

65
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:49,360
I guess is the new trend in movies.

66
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:54,260
You guys have this in your areas, where you can literally put your feet up and lean back

67
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:57,260
and all this, or is this just like a local thing that's starting to spread?

68
00:03:57,260 --> 00:04:01,060
I imagine the Bay Area had to probably get it first.

69
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:02,580
Usually they do.

70
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:07,660
But yeah, so I went and saw Power Rangers in the fancy theater and I liked it.

71
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:12,580
I know the critics are kind of saying it's kind of a mess, but I liked it well enough.

72
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:18,740
It had issues, but I don't like super get into the show, obviously the same way Shane

73
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:20,220
does, but I'm not a hater either.

74
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:22,100
I'm just like, okay, cool, Power Rangers.

75
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:26,700
I actually think the best way Shane ever kind of like, not that anyone should have to justify

76
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:30,600
their fandom, but you know, Power Rangers sometimes get seen as more of a kid's show

77
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,580
because it's like what, the Saturday morning show or something, right?

78
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:37,180
But I think the best way he ever justified it in that way and kind of made me go, oh,

79
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:41,500
was when he said, well, people get super into Marvel movies and Marvel heroes.

80
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:44,220
So if these are the heroes you're into, what's the difference?

81
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:46,140
And I was like, all right, fair.

82
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:47,140
You made a good point.

83
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:52,260
So I went and saw the Power Rangers just kind of approaching it as a Marvel movie because

84
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:54,340
that's clearly what they wanted it to be.

85
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:55,860
They're clearly trying to make a Marvel franchise.

86
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:58,500
Everybody's trying to make a Marvel franchise now, right?

87
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:01,980
So I saw it and I didn't think it was that bad.

88
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:08,540
I felt that like one character was way better developed than the other four, but I'm not

89
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:11,100
going to be spoilery, but I just, it was very obvious.

90
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:15,580
Like one character was like really, really well developed and like, you know, the audience

91
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:19,160
really like sympathizes with this person who gets into it and all this stuff.

92
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:22,520
And then the other four are just kind of like, oh yeah, here's our little one note things

93
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:24,740
that make us unique and that whole thing.

94
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:28,420
So and I liked Rita Repulsa.

95
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:33,120
I like Elizabeth Banks as Rita Repulsa, even though it's like totally not the campy version

96
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,340
from the nineties TV show.

97
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:38,140
Cause I do remember that I've seen enough of the show to know that, uh, totally different.

98
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:41,620
But like, I like seeing Elizabeth banks in a different role and I think she kind of knew

99
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:43,260
what movie she was in.

100
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:46,480
Like, you know, she, she knew what it was, so she had fun with it.

101
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:50,960
So look, I know it's, I know it's not a movie podcast, it's a video game podcast, but it's

102
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:54,100
inevitable that the two worlds collide once in a while.

103
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:55,100
Right?

104
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:56,100
Yeah, exactly.

105
00:05:56,300 --> 00:06:00,780
So you might be wondering why I have not introduced yet tonight, Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers.

106
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:03,280
Sadly, she is not here on tonight's show.

107
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:06,620
And I know she's very frustrated because she wants to be here with you guys and she will

108
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:09,300
join us on the Skype line a little later.

109
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:11,460
But I asked her, I asked her if I could tell you guys what's going on.

110
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:15,500
She said I could, so I'm not telling you all her business without getting permission first.

111
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,980
But she ended up in the hospital this week.

112
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:22,020
She had kidney stone, which if any y'all have ever gone through that, you know, they're

113
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:23,340
no fun at all.

114
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:28,420
My understanding is it was not large enough to qualify for the little sound thingy that

115
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:29,560
they usually do.

116
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:33,200
So she is currently waiting for nature to take its course.

117
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:35,680
And so she obviously didn't want to do that here.

118
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,200
So fair enough.

119
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:41,860
So anyway, we send Get Well vibes to Dark Sakura, who I think has been dealing with

120
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:44,760
a multitude of afflictions since the beginning of the year.

121
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:49,640
So I want to put that poor girl in the bubble when she's better.

122
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:51,940
Stay safe, Dark Sakura 2017.

123
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:55,020
So anyway, we will hear from her a little later in the show.

124
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:56,580
She's going to call in.

125
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:59,980
And if she happens to be listening, there's a lot of folks in chat that are sending their

126
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:01,480
well wishes.

127
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:05,900
Because again, we do tape live and you can join us at live.vognetwork.com, which Stapi

128
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:06,900
says that sucks.

129
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:10,340
And come on, Noel Gus says, oh, no, that sucks, poor Dark Sakura.

130
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:13,580
And on Mass Effect week two, right, right?

131
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:18,100
That's what I was hoping to get into at the top of the show this week, was talking a little

132
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:20,180
bit about the Mass Effect Andromeda launch.

133
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:22,700
So here's the other funny thing going on this week.

134
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:27,180
I mean, I don't know if it's the Mass Effect launch to blame for this or what's going on,

135
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:29,180
but like everything's broken, you guys.

136
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:33,740
So since we're doing that maintenance, right, over at vognetwork.com, that kind of kept

137
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:38,940
the website going up and down at the time that I usually go in to produce an episode

138
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:39,940
of the show.

139
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:43,680
We don't script the show, obviously, but we do like to have a nice little outline that

140
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,860
says Loki's going to talk about this, then Jamie's going to talk about this.

141
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:50,140
We like to have a nice little outline so we don't step on each other's feet and, you know,

142
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:53,660
talk about things twice and so forth, so there's a little order to the show.

143
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:57,060
Yeah, couldn't do that tonight because of the maintenance.

144
00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:01,420
Oops, I didn't, and they told us about the maintenance on Thursday, but I wasn't thinking

145
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:05,100
at that time, oh, Rob, you're going to need to get in the website then so you can produce

146
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:06,100
the night show.

147
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:09,740
I'm just thinking, oh, good, it'll be done by five o'clock when Bobby's live and when

148
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:13,020
we're live and so it won't really affect the listeners or whatever.

149
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:17,820
So I don't know what we're going to talk about tonight.

150
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:23,860
He's put some things together for us, though, and I've agreed to just shut up and comment

151
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:28,380
tonight so that I'm not stealing stories from Loki and, you know, he can talk about whatever

152
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:32,620
he wants, but if we did a kickoff topic tonight, I probably would have wanted to talk about

153
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:36,900
Mass Effect Andromeda, but unfortunately, Dark Sakura's not here, but obviously that

154
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:41,500
was a big release that has a lot of people's attention, although, Loki, you don't, I know

155
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:44,860
you, you're not super into Mass Effect, but has anything about Andromeda kind of caught

156
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:45,860
your eye?

157
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:49,660
Well, I watched a 20 minute video of all the features.

158
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:52,180
When you say features, you mean bugs, right?

159
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:56,620
Well, it wasn't, some of it's bugs and some of it's just like story stuff that just doesn't

160
00:08:56,620 --> 00:09:01,820
make any sense and like, don't get me wrong, I mean, I've been playing a ton of Skyrim,

161
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:11,380
so I'm well aware of bugs in games and stuff, but it's kind of like, you know, harming the

162
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:15,060
series, I think, you know, the fact that this is the quality that's coming out and you kind

163
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:19,220
of wonder, like, and I know there's been a lot of people, you know, developers and animators

164
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:22,660
and stuff that have come out in defense of it, it's like, the animation's hard.

165
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:28,900
I get that, but why wasn't it hard for three, two, and one, you know, and now all of a sudden

166
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:30,300
it's really hard.

167
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:33,580
It's just like, especially when you look at like the previous game, it's like, holy shit,

168
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:40,980
you know, there's been a very severe downgrade in the quality of, you know, even the facial

169
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:46,620
appearance and everything versus like the other games, but I don't know, some of the

170
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:50,380
like story stuff didn't seem to make any sense, like the reactions were just like kind of,

171
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:53,060
like they dial, phoned it in, I guess.

172
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:57,340
Here's the thing, I agree with you and I don't, like, now that I've spent, and I've spent

173
00:09:57,340 --> 00:10:01,220
a good, like, I think I've spent 20 hours, I think is what the clock is up to, and I'm

174
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:06,180
only like 23% or something all the way through the game, like, I've probably barely scratched

175
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:09,500
the surface on this, and that's not even counting multiplayer, that's just my single player

176
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:10,500
file.

177
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:14,260
That's not even counting, I've probably spent easy another four hours on multiplayer so

178
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:17,060
far, but anyway, I agree and I don't agree.

179
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:21,300
I think at the end of the day for me, Mass Effect, and you guys know I'm a fan of the

180
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:25,620
series and have been very vocal of how much I enjoy this series, so if you want to claim

181
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:29,740
that my opinion is biased, I'm using my quotey fingers, then fine.

182
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:32,860
But I can also recognize that this game is not a 10 out of 10.

183
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:36,260
This, Mass Effect Andromeda is not going to be a 10 out of 10.

184
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:40,740
I don't think, though, it's 7.5 or whatever Metacritic's saying out of 10 either.

185
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:44,460
We talked about the whole critic thing last week, I'm not going to double-talk that too

186
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:50,500
much, but I think the internet is giving this a little bit too much shit unnecessarily.

187
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:56,860
Yes, there are bugs in the game, clearly well-documented by some of these gifs and YouTubes and things,

188
00:10:56,860 --> 00:11:01,140
but like you said, there's a lot of games out there that have bugs in them when they

189
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:04,540
come out and then we hail them as game of the year, Skyrim.

190
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:08,660
Not that I'm excusing the bugs and all that, it's an issue, and it's one of Mass Effect

191
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:14,020
Andromeda's biggest issues, and what I feel is keeping Mass Effect Andromeda from being

192
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:19,260
a 10 out of 10 game, whereas Zelda Breath of the Wild is a 10 out of 10 game.

193
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:26,740
Yeah, and I think it comes to fandom again, that 10 out of 10 for Zelda, I think a lot

194
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:32,260
of these reviews overlooked those bugs, whereas in Mass Effect, they definitely paid attention

195
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:33,260
to the bugs.

196
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:38,180
Yes, yes, thank you for saying that, because I absolutely believe some of that is coming

197
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:39,180
into play.

198
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:44,180
And I don't want to turn to the darker things on the internet, and the whole social justice

199
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:46,540
warrior versus Twitter and all this-

200
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:48,580
I don't understand that complaint at all.

201
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:52,060
I don't, like, fucking quit it!

202
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:58,900
I'm not even going to say much more than that, my eyes roll to the back of my head so far

203
00:11:58,900 --> 00:11:59,900
I can see my brain.

204
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:02,020
What was the complaint about it, was it that they're saying that because the social justice

205
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:05,580
warriors were involved in it, that's why the facial animations were terrible, or are

206
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:07,860
they talking about being able to romance people of different genders?

207
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:12,060
I'm not even fucking sure, something about Bioware needing to pander to-

208
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:18,100
Oh, I remember the stupid argument, they wanted to make the characters uglier because apparently

209
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:22,220
social justice warriors are uglier or something, and so it's the pander-

210
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:23,220
What?!

211
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:27,580
I don't know, the whole argument was very stupid, so I was just like, whatever, I don't

212
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,140
understand what the point of this is, but-

213
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:35,140
I fucking can't, and I know it's a radio show, but I am using my hand to throw that out of

214
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:38,460
the ballpark because I don't give a fuck about all of that.

215
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:42,060
I don't understand what they were trying to accomplish with the argument, and I don't

216
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:46,780
understand how social justice warriors even come into play at all with this, but whatever.

217
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:50,260
I'm gonna tell you what it is, I'm gonna tell you what it is with the whole animations and

218
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:51,260
all of it.

219
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:56,600
And again, why Zelda is a 10 out of 10 game, and why Mass Effect Andromeda is not, okay?

220
00:12:56,600 --> 00:13:01,740
The reason is, Mass Effect Andromeda should have been delayed, again.

221
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:06,360
And I know, out of a 5 year development cycle, and right at the end of the fiscal year, that's

222
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:09,680
the last thing you want to hear a fan of the series who's been very adamant about waiting

223
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:12,760
for this game a long time to say, but that's the reality.

224
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:17,920
Because when they delayed Zelda, ain't nobody noting now that Zelda should have been a holiday

225
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:24,760
2016 game, because everybody's losing their shit over it, because it's really good, and

226
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:30,560
what draws a lot of people into Zelda are those little intricacies, right?

227
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:36,560
That cute little fucking dog that chases its tail, the fact that when you walk towards

228
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:41,000
the edge of a bridge, the guardsmen will say, no, don't do it, don't jump.

229
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,140
Like those little intricacies in the animations and things like that, that could only be done

230
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:51,020
because Zelda had time to cook in the oven until it was absolutely finished.

231
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:56,980
Mass Effect Andromeda did not, and that is what's very clear about this game.

232
00:13:56,980 --> 00:14:03,980
Because as I'm playing it, I'm going, did anyone at BioWare play this game from start

233
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:06,380
to finish?

234
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:10,660
Because a lot of these issues would have been very obvious, and I'm actually not even talking

235
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:15,700
about the animations and that stuff, I'm gonna be honest, that stuff honestly doesn't bother

236
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:19,740
me the way it seems to be bothering a lot of people, because I don't really notice it.

237
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:24,860
I'm not fixating in on five seconds that went wrong out of 20 hours that I've been playing.

238
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:28,980
Yes, I noticed in one scene my character was floating when he shouldn't have been.

239
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:31,100
That was really weird, okay?

240
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:35,580
But okay, it happened one time out of 20 hours, and I kind of just forgot about it and I moved

241
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:36,540
on.

242
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:42,180
But there's other weird shit that happens too, like for example, and I'm gonna choose

243
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:46,880
my words very carefully here because I'm trying to stay spoiler free, but in the beginning

244
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:52,160
of the game you go to a planet, and you might stay on that planet for a while and then obviously

245
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:56,040
the story is gonna take you to another planet, that's what you expect in a sci-fi game, right?

246
00:14:56,040 --> 00:15:02,720
Well you can go back to this planet and continue to do work on this planet to go even further.

247
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:08,400
Well at one point I did that, I went back to that planet and I did like just about everything

248
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:13,160
you could do on that planet, or at least when the game gave me a trophy for doing enough

249
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:14,160
on that planet.

250
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,160
Wink, nudge.

251
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,760
I'm trying to stay very spoiler free.

252
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:22,120
So then when I go to this other planet I then progress the story and I'm doing all this

253
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:25,560
stuff and then my crew members go, hey, did you hear?

254
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:30,320
The base over at the one planet had the problems fixed with the radiation, we should go back

255
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,560
and see what's going on.

256
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:35,200
And I'm like, I fucking did that two hours ago, like why are you just now having this

257
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,200
conversation?

258
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:40,280
Okay, let me bring this back to Skyrim.

259
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:45,440
I heard they're reforming the Dawnguard, you know, some sort of vampire hunters or something.

260
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:49,160
My god, every, you think Arrow to the Knee is fucking annoying?

261
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:57,280
After that fucking DLC update, every fucking guard has to tell me about the fucking Dawnguard.

262
00:15:57,280 --> 00:16:02,320
It's like, yes, I'm fucking aware of this stupid castle that, you know, these group

263
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:06,240
of people that fight vampires, it's like fucking shut up about it.

264
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,360
And Shane was telling me he had a weird issue too.

265
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:14,200
Like he had something where he went to the planet, the very first planet, and he met

266
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:17,940
two people that are supposed to join your squad, but they hadn't joined yet.

267
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:21,800
But then he went back to the ship, even though the story doesn't give you a reason to go

268
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:25,280
back to the ship, he wanted to go back there because he felt he could progress one of the

269
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:26,880
romance storylines.

270
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:30,280
And those people who had not yet joined his squad on the ship.

271
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:35,280
So there's like weird shit going on with the flags in the game that should be pretty obvious

272
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:39,440
to anyone that played the game start to finish in some different ways, you know, which is

273
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,800
what you do in QA.

274
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:47,840
So, and I'm not blaming Bioware or EA's QA department, because my thought is, they're

275
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:52,320
probably, these issues are probably well aware and documented, but there was a mandate that

276
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:56,960
that game had to be out by the end of the financial year, and that was the mistake.

277
00:16:56,960 --> 00:17:03,000
Because even though it sounds like I'm being very negative on the game, I actually, like,

278
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,520
it's pretty fucking amazing.

279
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:10,640
Like the scope of the game, the scope of all there is to do in the game, and that's even

280
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:13,440
without bringing multiplayer into it.

281
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:18,440
And the vast variety of conversations you can have, and all this stuff that's going

282
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:25,180
on, like, I actually feel like this is a incredibly epic game underneath all that shit that should

283
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:29,400
have been better, like, underneath all that, it's a pretty amazing game.

284
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:33,880
And so it kind of sucks that they rushed this out, because I think this game could have

285
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:37,160
been a 10 out of 10 if it had come out holiday 2017.

286
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,160
Probably.

287
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:41,520
Because they would have had time to iron out the bucks, and it still very well could get

288
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:44,240
better with bug patches and stuff like that.

289
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:47,000
Yeah, but now, who's gonna care now?

290
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Because...

291
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
People care when they patch it in that new ending.

292
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,400
A game kind of lives and dies by its, you know, release week, or what have you.

293
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:57,900
Which, you know, for better or for worse, not that I necessarily agree with it, but,

294
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:01,360
you know, will they slice the price of the game down to 30 bucks and then try to make

295
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,360
the money on DLC?

296
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:03,360
They already cut the price of the game.

297
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,360
What?

298
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:06,520
Yeah, I think they dropped about 24% of these.

299
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:08,760
I saw an article somewhere that said that.

300
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:11,000
Wow, that's something else if it's already dropped.

301
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:16,880
I mean, but here's the other unfortunate thing, is that for those of you guys that are rooting

302
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:21,160
for this game to fail, like, eat my entire ass.

303
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:25,800
Like seriously, like, as a fan of Mass Effect, eat my ass.

304
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:32,400
Because I don't want you guys to fuck this up and rob me of a sequel for Mass Effect

305
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:33,440
Andromeda.

306
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:38,720
Because I think back to the original trilogy and Mass Effect 1, 2, and 3.

307
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:42,240
And Mass Effect 1 kind of had a lot of issues too.

308
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:46,120
And especially when it came to driving, which this game has those same issues when it comes

309
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:48,240
to driving, right?

310
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:53,560
I feel like Mass Effect Andromeda 2 could be really, really fucking amazing, just like

311
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:56,640
Mass Effect 2 was, and then the third game could be great too.

312
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:00,320
But now I'm worried because of all of this fuckery that's going on on the internet, we're

313
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:03,240
not going to get that, and that would be a tragedy.

314
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:06,400
It would be a tragedy if we don't get a Mass Effect Andromeda 2.

315
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:12,000
I hope they do it the right way, and I hope they give it the time it needs to develop,

316
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:17,640
but I'm worried that all of this negativity is going to be a fucking snowball down the

317
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:21,200
mountain, and we're not going to end up seeing a Mass Effect Andromeda 2 because of it.

318
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:28,000
Because people, you know, were swayed by GIFs and ten second YouTube clips and things.

319
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,880
We'll see what the sales do.

320
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,720
Of what went wrong.

321
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:34,680
And some of that onus is on EA as well, I don't think they should have done the ten

322
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:36,520
hour preview.

323
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:39,000
Especially if the game was only half done and a lot of these issues are going to come

324
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
to light.

325
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:46,040
You need to sell those thirty dollar passes to play, you know, games early.

326
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:48,160
Pay for Violin Street Date.

327
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:53,820
Okay, so going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com, Dungeon Buster I think really feels similarly

328
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:58,400
to how I do, that says I could go on but it would sound like I actually hate the game,

329
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:02,460
which weirdly I don't because there are things that I actually like in it, but damn, what

330
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:05,280
the fuck happened to quality control?

331
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,960
And that's exactly where my head's at right here.

332
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:11,760
Tech2030 in chat says, is it the first game in a new trilogy?

333
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:15,640
I would assume that is the plan, but we'll see.

334
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:21,280
Dungeon Buster, with a hopeful comment that may make me feel a little better about things

335
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:24,760
and what's happening on the internet, Dungeon Buster says, Assassin's Creed Unity hasn't

336
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:27,880
stopped that franchise.

337
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:30,120
I hope you're right, I hope you're onto something with that comment.

338
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:38,600
It's okay, Mass Effect Andromeda, it was a development variation.

339
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:42,000
There's other things I could kind of get into in Mass Effect as well, and I feel like I

340
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:47,800
need to address some of these things, although I'm opening a whole can of worms, but I'm

341
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,360
just going to fucking say it.

342
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:52,520
So obviously there's a lot of controversy going on out there because, I don't know if

343
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:55,280
you've heard about this, Loki, I know you probably don't follow all this as closely

344
00:20:55,280 --> 00:21:01,000
as I do, but you are aware that part of a big draw to Mass Effect games is that the

345
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:06,800
subtitle should just be, Mass Effect Andromeda, who do I get to fuck?

346
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:07,800
That's what a lot of these games are about.

347
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:08,800
That's what people want to know.

348
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,360
Who do you get to fuck?

349
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:11,360
Is it everybody?

350
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:12,360
No.

351
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:13,360
No.

352
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:19,800
And that's part of what's happening here, because as a player who wants to play a gay

353
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:23,040
male shepherd, you have two romance options in the game.

354
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,040
I hope that isn't spoilery.

355
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:26,840
I'm sorry if, I'm very sorry if this is spoilery.

356
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:27,840
Gay writer, I guess.

357
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,960
I will not say who they are, okay?

358
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:36,720
So gay writer has two options on who he can romance, and in one of the romance scenes,

359
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:41,020
it does like a whole little flirtatious thing, and they're kind of like, they're kissing

360
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:44,800
and stuff, and then they kind of get into bed, and it fades to black, right?

361
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:49,040
The dot, dot, dot, and you know what happens after that.

362
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:52,560
In one of the, I think there are, somebody may have to correct me on this number, I believe

363
00:21:52,680 --> 00:22:00,080
there are at least four heterosexual male love scenes, so females, there are four females

364
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,080
you can romance, right?

365
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:06,680
I'm thinking in my high mind, there's her, there's her, there's her, and I think there's

366
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:07,680
one other.

367
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:08,680
So I think there's at least four.

368
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:09,680
I could be wrong.

369
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:10,680
There might be more.

370
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:11,680
Impressionator.

371
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:17,420
So in one of the scenes that I caught on YouTube of what happens with the male heterosexual

372
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:21,700
writer and one of the females, it's fucking porn.

373
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:28,820
Like it is, her titties are out, his ass is on display, she's sitting up on the counter,

374
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:32,540
he's pounding her, I'm not fucking kidding.

375
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:35,180
That's the soft core porn in the game.

376
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:43,820
Now look, I understand that anal might make some people uncomfortable, and I'm not saying

377
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:49,020
that that whole thing necessarily needs to be on the same display and all this, but why

378
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:50,020
is it?

379
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:51,020
You can do it tastefully.

380
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:55,140
You can do it tastefully, exactly, because that's what they're going to say about this

381
00:22:55,140 --> 00:23:00,900
whole male and female writer thing is that, well, it was done tastefully.

382
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:03,900
It's a tasteful Cinemax scene.

383
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:05,340
There's a discrepancy there.

384
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:09,440
There's a discrepancy in how it was done, and there's a discrepancy in how many options

385
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,380
you have.

386
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:13,860
Gay men have yet to be able to fuck an alien.

387
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:16,980
I just want to point that out.

388
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:19,600
Straight men, not a problem since the very first game.

389
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:24,620
You could have your way, it's well documented in Mass Effect 1, you can bed an asari character

390
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:28,220
in that game, and that trend kind of continues on into this game.

391
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:31,700
And there's female on female.

392
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:32,940
Where are my gay women at?

393
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:35,280
Hey, they have plenty of options as well.

394
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:39,240
Gay women have, I think, the same four options.

395
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:43,500
I'm sorry, I did not commit to memory all these different options, but gay women have

396
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:48,360
more options than gay men do.

397
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:53,880
By the way, there's a trophy in the game for romancing three different people throughout

398
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:55,680
the course of the game.

399
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:58,460
Now, think about that for a minute.

400
00:23:58,460 --> 00:24:02,680
How many did I just tell you gay writer gets to romance?

401
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:03,800
Two.

402
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:12,120
So you can't earn that trophy if you're gay writer, and of course, here's the witty retort,

403
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:17,380
here comes the tweet from the egg icon on Twitter, well, you could still get the, you're

404
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:22,000
not banned from getting the trophy, all you have to do is sleep with a woman.

405
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:26,880
Right, because I haven't fucking heard that line over my 38 years of existence.

406
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,280
Again, here's the spoon.

407
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:31,240
It's just for the trophies, okay?

408
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:32,240
It means nothing, but.

409
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:36,080
And drama is about procreation, which is funny because they get into that whole thing, and

410
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:39,840
I actually thought that part was well done because one of the gay characters feels a

411
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:44,060
little bit of guilt about the fact that there's supposed to be procreation, but I actually

412
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:46,240
thought that was well done, but I digress.

413
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:53,720
So anyway, but here's my worry, and I understand there is a trans character in the game that's

414
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:56,480
getting a lot of pushback as well.

415
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:01,720
I am not trans myself, so I feel like I can't really present this in the same way about

416
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:08,840
how this is offensive, but essentially, imagine it's this.

417
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:13,560
So I'm gonna walk up to you, hey, Loki, how you doing today?

418
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:16,680
By the way, did you know that I used to be a woman and my name was blank?

419
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:22,480
Like that's kinda how it's done in Mass Effect Andromeda.

420
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:26,440
That's the thing, it's like, I actually was, it was one of these videos that was complaining

421
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:30,620
about the social justice stuff, and I happened to watch it, and they were talking about that

422
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:34,180
this isn't the first game Bioware has done this, like they said they did that in Dragon

423
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:40,080
Age Inquisition as well, like one of the characters you meet, she's just like, hi, I'm such and

424
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:45,580
such, IP standing up, it's like, where the fuck did that come from?

425
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:47,440
Just ridiculous stuff.

426
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:52,980
So it's something that they've done in previous games, but it's like, kind of almost seems

427
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:57,780
like that they're doing it not to be progressive, it's just like, oh, we're just ticking the

428
00:25:57,780 --> 00:26:02,220
box because we wanna make sure this market's being taken care of.

429
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:09,100
Funny enough, even though that might not be the best way to come to that conclusion, but

430
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:14,340
I feel like that's kinda it, like this is where a lot of people who appreciate the diversity

431
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:18,060
or have in the past that Bioware's been trying to go for in some of these games are getting

432
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:22,060
a little annoyed, because now it's starting to feel like we're ticking boxes.

433
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:27,300
And again, I'm not trans myself, but so you guys understand, if you don't happen to know

434
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:32,820
anybody who's trans, what I'm told is to just come out and blurt what they call your

435
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:33,820
dead name.

436
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:40,620
Essentially, that was the name before you transitioned, right?

437
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:42,540
That's like something that doesn't fucking happen.

438
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:45,980
Like you don't go up to somebody and just say like, hi, did you know my name used to

439
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:46,980
be blank?

440
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:48,980
Like that's just not the way it works.

441
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:55,980
But you have to wonder, and again, if we happen to have any trans people out there listening,

442
00:26:55,980 --> 00:27:00,000
I would love to hear your perspective on this, if you're okay with the way it was done,

443
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,860
or if it pisses you off and why, because I would like to hear from that perspective,

444
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:09,580
but I'm trying to represent you all the best I can.

445
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:17,860
But this whole thing is like, did they have to do it that way so that maybe the people

446
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:22,540
who don't know somebody who's trans or who doesn't have that in their life would not

447
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:25,140
be able to get confused?

448
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:34,700
I mean, I don't know, and I'm not saying that's how they should have done it at all.

449
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:39,020
I'm just like, who thought that was a good idea?

450
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:44,620
That was just a weird way to do it, or at least get to know that character a little

451
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:46,540
bit first.

452
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:51,380
Make that character, I mean, heaven forbid we go there, make that character a romanceable

453
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:52,380
option.

454
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:56,060
And when you get to know that character more and more, then maybe she unveils a little

455
00:27:56,060 --> 00:28:01,340
bit more about her past, doesn't necessarily blurt out what her name used to be, but maybe

456
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:07,100
explains a little more about what, oh my God, can you imagine some of those egg icons on

457
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:08,100
Twitter?

458
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:13,100
What would happen if like, oh yeah, and see, then the problem is like, oh, hey, I romance

459
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:15,580
this hot female and you can guess what happened.

460
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:21,060
But that plays into another really bad trope that I can understand why Bioware would not

461
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:25,860
want to go down that road, because, you know, that's a whole slippery slope of its own.

462
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:29,940
Or here's what you could have done in the first place, why the fuck did you even have,

463
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:31,860
like, why the fuck did you decide in this game?

464
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:34,500
Yeah, we're gonna let you fuck the crew members.

465
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:37,440
Why even have that in a sci-fi game?

466
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:40,620
Why are we even bringing sexuality into these games in the first place?

467
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:44,900
Just have it be a game without, like, who cares?

468
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:49,460
Because in a two-hour movie that's dramatic, sometimes the characters have sex, Loki.

469
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:56,020
Like, it's the same thing in space, in a 60-hour plus epic game about drama, sometimes

470
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:58,180
you get closer to the characters and sometimes you have sex with them.

471
00:28:58,180 --> 00:28:59,180
Like that's what it is.

472
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:04,340
You just fucking do it the Saints Row four way, which is, you can fuck everyone.

473
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:05,900
That's it.

474
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:12,060
Okay, going to chat over at live.voggenetwork.com, let's see, William Murderface says, I know

475
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:17,740
a couple people who are, and I think mentioning trans, and yeah, many don't tend to talk about

476
00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:18,780
their dead names.

477
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:22,580
Of course, there are some who just don't give a fuck, but they seem to be a statistical

478
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:24,740
anomalies in that regard.

479
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:26,720
Dungeon Buster, I think, sums it up very well here.

480
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:27,720
This is nice.

481
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:31,940
The writing could have opened up more opportunities to learn more about that specific character

482
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:34,900
instead of just putting out a verbal billboard.

483
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:38,820
And Alex P. Carson answering your question, Loki says, sex.

484
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:39,820
Just because.

485
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:40,820
Sex.

486
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:41,820
Sex sounds like it.

487
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:45,100
I get it, but if they're not gonna do it smart, then what's the point, you know?

488
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:47,740
Don't implement a feature you can't implement correctly.

489
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:53,380
Alright, so anyway, I had to mention some of those issues, and here's...

490
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:58,220
And yes, I didn't like Saints Row IV, not because you could romance everybody, because

491
00:29:58,220 --> 00:30:04,620
I get the parody of that, but because it's not fucking Saints Row, it's just ridiculous

492
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:06,100
bullshit, the game.

493
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:10,260
Speaking of parody games, you posted that trailer on Twitter this week for that goat

494
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:13,660
simulator game, the goat simulator in space or whatever.

495
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:16,460
That looked fucking hilarious.

496
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:20,220
It was hitting on everything that Mass Effect is known for, including the romance scenes,

497
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:26,700
and I was like, well, brava, goat simulator developers, brava on you.

498
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:28,300
I'm excited to play that at some point.

499
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:29,620
I think it came out this week, actually.

500
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:30,620
Oh, did it come out this week?

501
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:31,620
The DLC, yeah.

502
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:32,620
I'm gonna have to check that out.

503
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:33,620
Here's...

504
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:37,100
Okay, this is the one other thing I want to say with all this social justice stuff and

505
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:43,060
all the trans representation and the gay male representation and so forth, is there's a

506
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:46,820
lot of this negativity that BioWare is getting in the reception because they should have

507
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:50,820
done better rather than just tick a box.

508
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:56,880
My concern is, are they going to then not do this in the future?

509
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:00,520
Because they're gonna say like, well, if we put a trans character or we put a gay character

510
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:04,780
or we put a XYZ character in the game, we're just gonna get all this hate mail, so next

511
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:05,960
time we're not gonna bother.

512
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:09,780
Try harder then, instead of just giving up because you failed the first time.

513
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:10,780
You gotta fail fast.

514
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:14,860
You gotta just, you try something, you take your feedback, you make it better.

515
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:16,900
Not just, oh, people didn't like it.

516
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:18,220
Well, too fucking bad.

517
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:19,220
You know what?

518
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:20,760
You try harder next time.

519
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:22,380
I am fucking proud of you, Loki.

520
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:23,500
Give me a high five.

521
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:30,300
That was, I, guys, that was Loki that just gave that statement.

522
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:34,300
You know, for every person that comes to me and says, when is Loki gonna shut the fuck

523
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:35,620
up about Nintendo?

524
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:36,620
Never.

525
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:39,460
I'm gonna play that back because you're okay, Loki.

526
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:41,020
At the end of the day, you're okay.

527
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:45,660
But it's, I mean, seriously, it's, I think the frustrates me the most about some people

528
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:48,620
is just like, willing to give up so easily.

529
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:52,820
It's just, why don't you just take the feedback from it and learn from it?

530
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:57,780
There's always gonna be people, you can't appease everyone, but do it in a way that

531
00:31:57,780 --> 00:32:03,420
makes sense instead of just, hi, my name is, you know, so and so.

532
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:04,780
Did you know I used to have a penis?

533
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:07,940
I mean, like, that's stupid, you know, just have them.

534
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:12,500
Nobody does that, or at least very few people probably do that.

535
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:19,500
But I just think there's easier ways to just develop it and more naturally, better writing.

536
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:20,500
Get better writers.

537
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:23,500
So, and here's, here's the thing.

538
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:25,700
I mean, as much as, how long has the show been on now?

539
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:26,700
Half an hour.

540
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:29,900
We've been talking about Mass Effect for half an hour.

541
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:30,900
It's like Jamie's here.

542
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:34,780
And it's, well, to be fair, I'm as bad as she is.

543
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:37,780
And for the most part, we've been shitting on a lot of elements of Mass Effect.

544
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:41,780
But I want to stress, there's a lot of good in Mass Effect.

545
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:44,860
There's a lot, a lot of, lot of good.

546
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:52,220
But it's extraordinarily frustrating to see these things that flopped, that could have

547
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:56,940
been fixed if the game had just gone through another few months of quality check.

548
00:32:56,940 --> 00:33:00,540
And at the end of the day, that's, that's what, like, even, even some of these things

549
00:33:00,540 --> 00:33:06,380
we're talking about with, with the representation of the different minorities, like, maybe if

550
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:11,060
the game had had a longer QA period, they could have brought in some more gay men, some

551
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:15,820
more trans individuals, some more, you know, to play the game and give that, give this

552
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:18,300
feedback that now they're getting on Twitter.

553
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:19,300
So.

554
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:21,980
I would be surprised if they don't have that feedback already.

555
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:22,980
I mean, cause come on.

556
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:25,180
I mean, they've been doing this for how many games now?

557
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:26,180
Yeah.

558
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:28,340
Like, so that should be there.

559
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:32,420
And I mean, I think EA is a pretty progressive company.

560
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:33,420
They have staff for-

561
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:38,060
To be fair, I know EA has gotten a lot of shit over the years, but EA was there at the

562
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:45,160
very first GamerX, EA is in the pride parades, EA's, EA's, EA's trying to do the right thing.

563
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:49,980
You know, so I, I can't believe I'm going to say it, but just, just go back to what

564
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:55,100
Loki said a little bit ago, take the feedback and do better.

565
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:56,100
There it is.

566
00:33:56,100 --> 00:34:00,940
Ah, uh, William Ritterface in chat says, isn't it the case that we often criticize that which

567
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:05,940
we want to see succeed most, not because we hate it, but because we want it to do well.

568
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:09,820
So this is not surprising, which by the way, since I just, I mentioned it, it's kind of

569
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:14,860
a joke a minute ago, but it's, it's so the case again, listen to this, Loki, isn't it

570
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:18,700
the case that we often criticize that which we want to see succeed most?

571
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:19,700
Nintendo.

572
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:20,700
Yes.

573
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:26,100
It, well, we criticize Nintendo because we know that they're capable of better.

574
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:27,660
And that's, that's the frustration.

575
00:34:27,660 --> 00:34:31,380
And it's like, dude, you used to be fucking phenomenal.

576
00:34:31,380 --> 00:34:33,940
There's their games were fucking phenomenal.

577
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:38,260
And it's like now they're just hitting, they're like setting the bar so low for themselves.

578
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:41,420
It's just like, come on you guys, I know you can do better.

579
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:43,100
You got an A on the last report.

580
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:45,900
Why are you getting C's now?

581
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:49,020
That's kind of spoken like a true father.

582
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:50,020
That's the thing.

583
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:53,200
It's like my, my kids do this all the time and that's, you know, comes with the frustration

584
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:56,900
of quitting because it's like, oh, I don't want to do this cause it's hard cause they

585
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:57,900
got it wrong.

586
00:34:57,900 --> 00:34:58,900
Or I know I'm going to get it wrong.

587
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:02,380
Well, you're not trying and that pisses me off even more than you failing.

588
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:05,540
Well, not that pissing, not that you failing would piss me off.

589
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:08,220
It's just, you know, try it.

590
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:09,620
God damn it.

591
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:14,600
Um, tiger Han chat says, sky, what do you think of games and comic book movies trying

592
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:17,740
to shoehorn LGBT characters just to appeal?

593
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:20,220
I think it's appeal, not appear to the demographic.

594
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:22,900
Uh, yeah, that's quite obvious actually.

595
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:24,980
I think here's the thing.

596
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:28,540
I'll bring up the power Rangers movie cause that was all in the news, right?

597
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:33,100
The fact like, OMG, it's the first like gay superhero or what have you, right?

598
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:39,060
Like honestly, it's not, how do I phrase this?

599
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:43,300
I want to say it's not a huge moment in the movie, although it kind of is during a key

600
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:47,220
moment as to what is bringing these five individuals together and so forth.

601
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:51,340
Um, so, but, but what, what I'm trying to say is that the, I don't want to say it's

602
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:55,740
a throwaway line, but it's just one of those things that's kind of like quickly like, yeah,

603
00:35:55,740 --> 00:35:56,820
that's kind of what's going on.

604
00:35:56,820 --> 00:36:02,540
And then it's like we move on into the discussion and that's kind of, I don't know, in some

605
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:09,540
ways, I kind of like that as when I tell people that I happen to be gay and I'm married to

606
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:13,140
a man, I kind of like that they can just go, all right, cool.

607
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:15,380
So do you guys have a cat?

608
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:17,420
You know, like that's, that's it, right?

609
00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:21,860
Like that's, that's kind of how I prefer the conversations to go is that it's not a big

610
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:22,860
fucking deal.

611
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:25,900
Like if people have questions, I'm happy to answer as long as it comes from a place of

612
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:26,900
education.

613
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:32,340
But, you know, don't ask the question like, well, well, well, who's on top in that relationship?

614
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:33,340
That's not your fucking business.

615
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:34,420
It should be like that.

616
00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:38,900
It's just like if you saw an interracial couple, oh, your, your, your wife's black.

617
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:40,780
I mean, like, so how's that work?

618
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:46,220
I mean, like no one does that anymore because it's, it's such a, a normal thing and that's,

619
00:36:46,220 --> 00:36:47,220
well, well, okay.

620
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:53,380
Most people don't, when I say everyone, I mean every sane person.

621
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:56,580
So most people don't say that.

622
00:36:56,580 --> 00:36:58,460
It's like, it's not even a thing that you think about.

623
00:36:58,460 --> 00:37:01,180
And I think we're almost, we'll be there soon.

624
00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:03,540
You know, where it's just like, oh, you guys are married.

625
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:04,540
Cool.

626
00:37:04,540 --> 00:37:05,540
I mean, that's it.

627
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:07,540
I mean, that's how it should be.

628
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:09,180
It shouldn't even be a thing.

629
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:10,180
Yeah.

630
00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:11,180
I know.

631
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:12,540
I'm trying to fantasize about people naked.

632
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:19,700
So next time somebody, not, not that anybody's dumb enough to actually ask me who's on top

633
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:20,700
in that relationship.

634
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:24,060
I I'm going to, I mean, would you like to know, I'm trying to picture me naked.

635
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:25,300
Do you want to just see me naked?

636
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:27,420
Like is that what we're getting at here?

637
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:28,740
Um, but okay.

638
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:30,460
So back to the whole power ranger thing, right?

639
00:37:30,460 --> 00:37:33,620
So actually the way they did it in the movie was fine.

640
00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:41,100
It's the whole fucking internet fuck fest that's going on on like the whole, like, oh

641
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:44,860
my God, it's a lesbian power ranger.

642
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:49,540
They, this whole big thing is so this stuff that's going on and the fact that it's like

643
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:54,260
a adult rated movie in Russia and all this stuff is going on, that's just kind of like,

644
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:58,060
that's the part where I'm going like, fucking calm down.

645
00:37:58,060 --> 00:38:00,060
It's 2017.

646
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:01,140
Don't get me wrong.

647
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:03,340
I appreciate the representation.

648
00:38:03,340 --> 00:38:10,140
I think it's fucking fantastic that this ranger can say, yeah, I'm having girlfriend problems.

649
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:12,300
And the other rangers are like, okay, cool.

650
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:14,580
And, and like moving on, like I'm cool.

651
00:38:14,580 --> 00:38:20,980
And so that way, if there is a little girl out there who has some, well, you know, I

652
00:38:20,980 --> 00:38:24,260
need to choose my words carefully here because nobody under a certain age should probably

653
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:27,700
be having romantic feelings of any kind, but you know, a teenage, when I say a little,

654
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:32,940
I mean like a teenage girl, who's the age in the movie is having these conflicting feelings.

655
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:35,980
Being able to see some of that representation, like, oh fuck, there's like somebody like

656
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:37,380
me out there.

657
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:38,380
Right.

658
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:43,580
And this is a battle that continues on for racial minorities too.

659
00:38:43,580 --> 00:38:47,780
And that whole thing, like, you know, why did we have this whole thing with the Oscars

660
00:38:47,780 --> 00:38:52,620
a couple of years ago, where it was the Oscar so white and all this stuff, because, you

661
00:38:52,620 --> 00:38:57,940
know, I think a lot of black individuals like to see themselves in movies and there was

662
00:38:57,940 --> 00:39:04,340
a lot of great talent and great movies that were going extremely like unrecognized and

663
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:05,340
so forth.

664
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:13,460
A lot changed for the better this year, but I would, I would, we're not there yet, but

665
00:39:13,460 --> 00:39:18,020
things are going in the right direction where now we are acknowledging and hopefully at

666
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:25,340
the end of the day, opening up more roles for people that are not just like white men.

667
00:39:25,340 --> 00:39:27,100
You know, that's, that's what it is.

668
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:30,940
Anyway, I don't want to get too preachy on the show, but that's, you know how it goes.

669
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:33,420
Go into chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

670
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:36,540
Tiger claw and chat says, sky, you heard the internet is going ape shit over wonder

671
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:38,300
woman's armpit.

672
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:39,300
What the fuck?

673
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:40,300
No.

674
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:41,300
What does she not shave it or something?

675
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:42,940
Is that a thing?

676
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:43,940
Gives a shit.

677
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:46,060
Who's actually free streaming that shit to check.

678
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:50,820
If she grew up in the fucking jungle, I would think that she probably doesn't shave her

679
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:55,300
armpit and that's probably historically accurate, which I can't believe I'm saying about a comic

680
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:56,300
book movie.

681
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:59,860
But I mean, yeah, somebody's got too much time on their hands.

682
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:00,860
You know why?

683
00:40:00,860 --> 00:40:03,020
You know why somebody noticed it?

684
00:40:03,020 --> 00:40:06,940
Because it took them out of the sexualization of wonder woman for a minute.

685
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:10,220
Like I can't fap to her now.

686
00:40:10,220 --> 00:40:16,380
She doesn't, she doesn't, she doesn't buy these products to, to conform to some sort

687
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:18,180
of standard that magazines has put out there.

688
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:21,060
I can't fap to her anymore.

689
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:22,460
That's why somebody noticed it.

690
00:40:22,460 --> 00:40:25,940
Once again, people just giving up before they actually try.

691
00:40:25,940 --> 00:40:26,940
Oh, is it?

692
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:28,620
Oh, Brad's telling me it's the other way around.

693
00:40:28,620 --> 00:40:30,020
It's because she does shave.

694
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:31,180
Oh my God.

695
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:33,500
No one is fucking happy about anything.

696
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:34,500
Nobody's happy with anything.

697
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:35,500
Who cares?

698
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:39,500
Again, stop staring at her armpits.

699
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:40,500
It's okay.

700
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:43,020
Cause she has a massive bush under her fucking costume.

701
00:40:43,020 --> 00:40:46,940
See, it's just, it's, it's even now.

702
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:48,940
Okay.

703
00:40:48,940 --> 00:40:52,460
God, people are so complaining.

704
00:40:52,460 --> 00:40:56,780
I swear people just want to fucking complain about anything on the internet because they'll

705
00:40:56,780 --> 00:40:58,940
get fucking attention for it.

706
00:40:59,380 --> 00:41:01,380
It's like everything.

707
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:09,540
I broke Rob.

708
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:14,580
I think we need to move on.

709
00:41:14,580 --> 00:41:16,180
All right, let's do that.

710
00:41:16,180 --> 00:41:19,220
Uh, wait, we need to talk about other games we've been playing this week besides just

711
00:41:19,220 --> 00:41:23,140
Mass Effect and the same man called How Was Your Game?

712
00:41:23,140 --> 00:41:24,740
Loki, how was your gaming week?

713
00:41:24,740 --> 00:41:29,540
Um, so this week I actually played, well, I was going to play more, um, Zelda, but you

714
00:41:29,540 --> 00:41:32,340
know, honestly, I haven't felt compelled to do it.

715
00:41:32,340 --> 00:41:36,420
That weapon, you know, the weapon damage to something is really bothering me.

716
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:38,460
So I just, I haven't gotten around to it.

717
00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:43,420
Um, instead I played more Skyrim, so I made it through which storylines now?

718
00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:48,140
So I went through the rest of the actual Civil War storylines.

719
00:41:48,140 --> 00:41:49,140
That's all done.

720
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:57,100
Um, I think I did, um, I can't remember if I had finished the whole actual, like, Dragonborn,

721
00:41:57,100 --> 00:42:02,820
not the DLC Dragonborn storyline, but the actual All the Winds storyline in the game.

722
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:04,140
So I did that.

723
00:42:04,140 --> 00:42:09,220
Um, I started doing the Bard stuff now, which is completely boring, but I'm going to get

724
00:42:09,220 --> 00:42:10,220
through that pretty quick.

725
00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:15,060
And then it's going to be on to Dawnguard because I figure if I complete the Dawnguard

726
00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:19,860
DLC, then they can stop fucking telling me about stupid Dawnguard, and that's really

727
00:42:19,860 --> 00:42:22,420
my only motivation to finish that DLC.

728
00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:25,340
So I finished it before when I had mods on there, but now that I'm playing a whole new

729
00:42:25,340 --> 00:42:30,060
save, I got to do it again, but my god, it's seriously irritating.

730
00:42:30,060 --> 00:42:33,700
Um, so then the other thing I've been doing, um, like, because I was unaware that they

731
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:37,140
have this going on, this whole water festival thing in Pokemon, I just thought, like, this

732
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:39,820
is a weird glitch, that there's, like, fish everywhere.

733
00:42:39,820 --> 00:42:43,060
And so then finally I read up, oh, it's an event going on.

734
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:47,740
So I thought the game was just broken, which, you know, wouldn't be that far off.

735
00:42:47,740 --> 00:42:52,820
So I've been playing quite a bit to get, um, you know, as many new Pokemon as I can, because,

736
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:56,880
you know, I don't normally go near water, I'm not going to San Francisco or anything,

737
00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:00,980
so a lot of these are brand new for my stuff, and it just, it's a good way to kill time

738
00:43:00,980 --> 00:43:05,380
when I have to sit at a birthday party, for example, like I did today.

739
00:43:05,380 --> 00:43:08,740
Um, and then what else did I play?

740
00:43:08,740 --> 00:43:16,460
Um, I played briefly, because I installed it for my son, Super Mario Run, on Android,

741
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:21,540
so I put it on his tablet for him, and the only thing that really pisses me off about

742
00:43:21,540 --> 00:43:25,700
Super Mario Run is the forced tutorial that they have in the beginning, because all I

743
00:43:25,700 --> 00:43:30,380
wanted to do was, like, quickly install it on there, and just pay for it so that the

744
00:43:30,380 --> 00:43:33,780
app is unlocked, and then go, and let my son just play the game.

745
00:43:33,780 --> 00:43:38,060
But no, I had to do, they had to show me every fucking element from the stupid game, it took

746
00:43:38,100 --> 00:43:43,500
for goddamn ever just to finish the thing, and it plays okay, I just don't, it's not

747
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:47,140
a game I'm interested in, he really loves it, he's been playing it, like, all the last

748
00:43:47,140 --> 00:43:51,340
two days, so, um, you know, he got that going for him, plus it's easy enough for him to

749
00:43:51,340 --> 00:43:54,860
be able to play, you know, he's just like, oh, I really like the fact that I can play

750
00:43:54,860 --> 00:43:59,060
this, you know, because, um, he can put the easy mode on if he dies or something like

751
00:43:59,060 --> 00:44:04,500
that, and he's almost finished all the levels, so it's, you know, props to them for that.

752
00:44:05,060 --> 00:44:09,900
I think it's worth the money for his entertainment, it's not something I would buy for myself,

753
00:44:09,900 --> 00:44:15,940
but kids like it, I guess that's kind of the demographic, so, um, so yeah, and then that's

754
00:44:15,940 --> 00:44:22,180
what I played, and then, um, that was really it, yeah, I bought a 3D printer, I haven't

755
00:44:22,180 --> 00:44:25,380
Did you, that's right, I knew you were gonna get that, you actually bought it, huh?

756
00:44:25,380 --> 00:44:26,540
Yeah, I decided to do it.

757
00:44:26,540 --> 00:44:27,540
That's awesome.

758
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:28,540
What are you gonna print?

759
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:29,540
A gun?

760
00:44:29,540 --> 00:44:34,380
If I want to, but no, I'm not gonna print a gun, um, no, actually, there's a lot of

761
00:44:34,420 --> 00:44:38,780
projects, like, that I want to make stuff that, you know, requires, like, 3D printing

762
00:44:38,780 --> 00:44:42,820
or something of the sort, and so I thought it'd be just, you know, kind of fun to be

763
00:44:42,820 --> 00:44:47,940
able to get one of those, so I got a TiVo Tarantula, which is like a Prusa i3 Chinese

764
00:44:47,940 --> 00:44:54,300
knockoff thing, so it's not perfect when I get it, so I have to do a lot of fixes and

765
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:58,140
mods to it, which will be fun, because I get to learn the process, and there's a lot of

766
00:44:58,140 --> 00:45:03,700
troubleshooting with those, which is not exactly ideal for some people, but I like the challenge

767
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:10,180
of it, so I'm very curious to see how that's gonna go, um, so yeah, I ordered it, they

768
00:45:10,180 --> 00:45:14,220
haven't shipped it yet, because they have, they drop ship, and so they'll probably ship

769
00:45:14,220 --> 00:45:19,820
it sometime in the next week, so hopefully I should have it probably, uh, probably a

770
00:45:19,820 --> 00:45:22,260
couple weeks, so be able to try it.

771
00:45:22,260 --> 00:45:27,540
Ragenator in chat with the question, what's the TTP on that 3D printer, Loki OLR, and

772
00:45:27,540 --> 00:45:34,140
if you're new to OLR, TTP is timed penis, which is whenever game makers give you something

773
00:45:34,140 --> 00:45:39,540
where you can create, i.e. LittleBigPlanet, i.e. Super Mario Maker, whatever, how long

774
00:45:39,540 --> 00:45:40,940
until somebody does a penis?

775
00:45:40,940 --> 00:45:41,940
It's usually a matter of seconds.

776
00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:46,340
I'm sure that they probably, someone's already, I'm sure someone's already 3D printed a penis,

777
00:45:46,340 --> 00:45:50,920
if whether I'm gonna 3D print a penis, probably not, because prints take like several hours,

778
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:55,780
that's a lot of dedication and like, money, I mean, I don't see the need to print a 3D

779
00:45:55,780 --> 00:46:06,020
penis for anything, so, I probably, I probably will not print a 3D penis on there, um, but

780
00:46:06,020 --> 00:46:08,860
never say never, so, you know.

781
00:46:08,860 --> 00:46:14,180
Alright, uh, come on, Noel Gust in chat says, print OLR bobbleheads, there you go, that'll

782
00:46:14,180 --> 00:46:18,780
give you something a little, you've got other products, there's something up your sleeve

783
00:46:18,780 --> 00:46:21,020
you're gonna want to print, you bought it for something.

784
00:46:21,020 --> 00:46:24,900
I just bought it because I wanted to buy something, I don't know, it's either that or upgrade

785
00:46:24,900 --> 00:46:29,780
my computer, and upgrading my computer was, uh, more expensive, so I decided, I decided

786
00:46:29,780 --> 00:46:33,460
just to do this, because it was only actually out the door, I think it was only like $2.65,

787
00:46:33,460 --> 00:46:37,980
so, not bad at all, plus it's a kit, I could build it, it's even better.

788
00:46:37,980 --> 00:46:38,980
Fun!

789
00:46:38,980 --> 00:46:39,980
Awesome.

790
00:46:39,980 --> 00:46:42,900
Uh, let's see, my gaming week, so obviously I've been playing a crap ton of Mass Effect

791
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:46,560
Andromeda, that's really been the game that's dominating my week, which again, despite everything

792
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:50,660
we talked about in the beginning of the game, I really think there is like, I, I don't,

793
00:46:50,660 --> 00:46:56,060
I don't know how else to explain it, it's like, there's this fantastic, like, core game

794
00:46:56,060 --> 00:46:59,740
that's amazing, and there's all these worlds to see, and then it's like, it's wrapped in

795
00:46:59,740 --> 00:47:00,740
tin foil.

796
00:47:00,740 --> 00:47:05,140
Like, I, I don't, I don't know how else to, to describe it, uh, I, I do think there's

797
00:47:05,140 --> 00:47:09,980
more good than bad in Andromeda, but unfortunately these bad things need to be talked about,

798
00:47:09,980 --> 00:47:14,660
because I think, I, I really do think when people kind of go back at the end of the year,

799
00:47:14,660 --> 00:47:18,540
we're talking about the game of the year, which will undoubtedly be Zelda, I don't,

800
00:47:18,540 --> 00:47:22,580
I mean, unless there's some big holiday surprises at the end of the year.

801
00:47:22,580 --> 00:47:23,580
Reddit Redemption 2?

802
00:47:23,580 --> 00:47:24,580
That's probably 2018.

803
00:47:24,580 --> 00:47:28,460
Well, I, I, I just, I really don't see how Zelda Breath of the Wild isn't like game of

804
00:47:28,460 --> 00:47:33,060
the year at this point, and why, why it's Zelda and not Mass Effect Andromeda.

805
00:47:33,060 --> 00:47:36,660
I just need to give it more time, same with like Final Fantasy 15, man, all these games

806
00:47:36,660 --> 00:47:40,620
are in my backlog now that, like, I was really looking forward to those, and it's kind of

807
00:47:40,620 --> 00:47:45,140
like, eh, when they came out, you know, it's, yeah, I don't know.

808
00:47:45,140 --> 00:47:48,700
But you know, I think we're gonna look back and say, God, they really should have delayed

809
00:47:48,700 --> 00:47:51,380
Mass Effect Andromeda, and it probably could have been game of the year if it came out

810
00:47:51,380 --> 00:47:55,640
during the holiday, but, you know, EA wants to make, you know, be in, be in the black

811
00:47:55,640 --> 00:47:59,020
for their financial year, so they didn't want to delay it again, but we'll see, we'll see

812
00:47:59,020 --> 00:48:01,140
if that costs them.

813
00:48:01,140 --> 00:48:03,180
Anyway, so I did play other games.

814
00:48:03,180 --> 00:48:07,300
I played, of course, I always play Final Fantasy 14, that's always kind of, even if I'm, like,

815
00:48:07,300 --> 00:48:09,980
binging on Mass Effect, like, there just comes a point where I'm like, okay, I can't play

816
00:48:09,980 --> 00:48:13,980
any more Mass Effect tonight, I'm gonna just do something else, because, you know, I just

817
00:48:13,980 --> 00:48:16,660
need to take my mind off Mass Effect for a little bit and do something else, so I'll

818
00:48:16,660 --> 00:48:21,020
play a little bit of Final Fantasy 14, or there's been a couple other games as well.

819
00:48:21,020 --> 00:48:25,100
I didn't talk about this last week, so I need to bring it up now, but Loki, an old favorite

820
00:48:25,100 --> 00:48:31,300
of yours, and mine, came out on the PlayStation 4 a week ago, Clicker Heroes, on the PlayStation

821
00:48:31,300 --> 00:48:35,300
4, believe it or not, which, Yes, I've purposely avoided that.

822
00:48:35,300 --> 00:48:39,140
Look, and if you don't know, So is it, like, button press heroes now?

823
00:48:39,140 --> 00:48:43,180
Yeah, it's basically button press heroes, square, square heroes, because you get square

824
00:48:43,180 --> 00:48:46,100
over and over as the click.

825
00:48:46,100 --> 00:48:49,380
It's the same game, there's not a lot to say about it, it's one of those colossal fucking

826
00:48:49,380 --> 00:48:52,360
time wasters, it's a calculator game, right?

827
00:48:52,360 --> 00:48:56,980
Just like cookie clickers, one plus one equals, equals equals equals equals equals equals

828
00:48:56,980 --> 00:48:59,660
equals equals equals, so you just watch the number grow.

829
00:48:59,660 --> 00:49:02,140
That's what these games end up being, like, that non-stop night we were playing on the

830
00:49:02,140 --> 00:49:06,900
phone for a little bit that Brad from Pop Culture got us into, all those games are calculator

831
00:49:06,900 --> 00:49:11,500
games, and so is Clicker Heroes, except it's on the PlayStation 4, and, do you know how

832
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:16,620
that fucking game sucked me into, like, come on, one more time, Rob Roberts, come on, I

833
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:21,580
know, I know we, you played way too much of me on the PC, but come on, Rob, one more time,

834
00:49:21,580 --> 00:49:22,860
you know what got me in?

835
00:49:22,860 --> 00:49:23,860
Trophies.

836
00:49:23,860 --> 00:49:28,840
They fucking put trophies in it, in a free-to-play game, and so, of course, I was like, well,

837
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:33,980
I mean, I can get that bronze trophy really easy, ascend one time, that doesn't take that

838
00:49:33,980 --> 00:49:34,980
long to do.

839
00:49:34,980 --> 00:49:38,860
So is it all the trophies that they had, like, in the game before, like, but now with actual

840
00:49:38,860 --> 00:49:39,860
trophies?

841
00:49:39,860 --> 00:49:43,220
No, because there was a ton of trophies in the game, like, the little mini-achievements

842
00:49:43,220 --> 00:49:46,860
and stuff, those are all still there, but you only actually get trophies for, like,

843
00:49:46,860 --> 00:49:51,260
maybe ten different things, and there's no platinum, so I think you could probably knock

844
00:49:51,260 --> 00:49:54,660
a few of them out in an hour, but then if you want to get the rest, you're gonna have

845
00:49:54,660 --> 00:49:59,460
to invest some serious stuff, like, one of them is, like, get to zone 3600, which I think

846
00:49:59,460 --> 00:50:07,480
is a gold, but, I mean, it's gonna take a long time to get to zone 3600, so, you know.

847
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:11,800
But it's a cute little time waster, again, in between sessions of other games, I just,

848
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:15,520
the one thing I'm gonna complain about that game is that it doesn't work in sleep mode.

849
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:20,320
If you put it in sleep mode, and then, you know, wake up your PlayStation 4 later, you

850
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:22,720
don't get any coins from when it was sleeping.

851
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:24,280
You have to close the game.

852
00:50:24,280 --> 00:50:25,520
Oh, yeah, yeah.

853
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:28,840
That needs to be fixed, and that's the one complaint I have about it.

854
00:50:28,840 --> 00:50:32,760
I understand why they don't do that, because stuff's not supposed to persist, it's basically,

855
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:37,440
like, a save state, so you're freezing everything, so I understand that part of it.

856
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:41,320
Yeah, I mean, I understand why it's happening, but it's stupid, they need to figure out how

857
00:50:41,320 --> 00:50:42,320
to fix that.

858
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:46,360
Like, save the game right before it sleeps, and then reload it, or do something, I don't

859
00:50:46,360 --> 00:50:47,360
know.

860
00:50:47,360 --> 00:50:48,360
But anyway.

861
00:50:48,360 --> 00:50:54,480
I'm just too, the problem with those games is that I'm too compelled to cheat, and I

862
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:59,000
will find a way to cheat, whether that means modding a controller to, like, put a timing

863
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:00,000
switch in there.

864
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
Get one of those little woodpecker things.

865
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:06,960
Auto-fire triggers or something, you know, I will find a way to cheat in that game, and

866
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
then it'll be just like, okay, this is stupid.

867
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:10,000
Yeah.

868
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:15,560
All right, so there's Clicker Heroes, and then on the Switch this week, I checked out

869
00:51:15,560 --> 00:51:20,280
Splatoon 2 during the test fire, which, over this weekend, I think it's done now, I think,

870
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:23,320
or the last one might be at 8 o'clock tonight, no, I think it actually wrapped up this morning,

871
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:27,120
I don't think there are any more play periods, but there were six play periods, I checked

872
00:51:27,120 --> 00:51:32,160
out two of them, and I played a little bit of Splatoon 2, and there really wasn't a lot

873
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:36,920
to it, because you couldn't customize the characters, you could pick one of four weapons,

874
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:41,800
you couldn't play with friends, you couldn't really control anything, but again, it was

875
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:46,400
a free test fire, they really just wanted to test the server capabilities, and for the

876
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:51,160
most part, for me anyway, it ran fine, like, from the internet does it work perspective,

877
00:51:51,160 --> 00:51:52,160
it was great.

878
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:54,560
I hope no one bought the system for that beta.

879
00:51:54,560 --> 00:52:00,000
I doubt it, but it's a nice little, like, well, if you bought the system now and you

880
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,960
don't own Zelda, like, what are you doing?

881
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:05,080
Like, I don't know what else you would have right now.

882
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:08,400
Much before the movie, they had, like, a big ol' thing about the Switch, where they

883
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:13,640
show off one, two Switch, that is literally the stupidest thing to show.

884
00:52:13,640 --> 00:52:18,160
That's what they're trying to get the casuals with, is those games, so.

885
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:21,680
But what happened with getting the casuals with The Legend of Zelda when the first Nintendo

886
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:22,680
came out?

887
00:52:22,680 --> 00:52:26,720
Fuck that, just playing, like, The Legend of Zelda, it's not casual, it's just, it's

888
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:28,880
a fucking great game.

889
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:35,040
So anyway, I enjoyed Splatoon enough, I mean, it was pretty much the same as the first game,

890
00:52:35,560 --> 00:52:40,800
because you can't really peel back all the new layers, because this is just one particular

891
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:41,800
element of the game.

892
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:47,360
So again, I can't review Splatoon 2 based off an extremely limited demo of the game,

893
00:52:47,360 --> 00:52:52,840
but I mean, it was that, it was that same game that I got into during Splatoon 1, and

894
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:56,280
I'm really excited to be able to play this with friends, like, again, the convention

895
00:52:56,280 --> 00:53:00,320
thing is gonna be off the hook, like, I can't wait for that.

896
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:05,200
I did, okay, and somebody will correct me if I don't say, there is a new weapon, and

897
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:08,160
some of the new abilities are different, and there are, you know, things like that, but,

898
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:12,480
I mean, come on, those are incremental upgrades you'd kind of expect with a new Splatoon game,

899
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:17,360
so there's not a lot I can really say about it besides that, but I had fun that I played,

900
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:22,000
even though I think I only won, like, one match out of all the ones I played, but a

901
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:26,020
lot of them, we ended up four versus three, and a lot of them, I don't know if there were

902
00:53:26,020 --> 00:53:30,700
people having connection problems, or just that many people were quitting, but, like,

903
00:53:30,700 --> 00:53:35,360
I don't think I was losing because we were necessarily bad, we were losing because we

904
00:53:35,360 --> 00:53:40,420
kept fucking being under, underrepresented, we only had three people to their four, and

905
00:53:40,420 --> 00:53:44,460
of course you're gonna lose, so Nintendo does, I think, maybe need to figure out, can they

906
00:53:44,460 --> 00:53:49,940
mitigate that problem somehow, can they have a robot that comes in and plays while it tries

907
00:53:49,940 --> 00:53:54,060
to fill the space, like, I don't know, I, anyway.

908
00:53:54,100 --> 00:53:57,980
I was gonna say, Bobby insists that there were no casual gamers when the original Zelda

909
00:53:57,980 --> 00:54:02,620
came out, well, that's not true, there were casual arcade game players, so I would say

910
00:54:02,620 --> 00:54:05,300
that there were casual game players, but.

911
00:54:05,300 --> 00:54:06,300
But not the same way we think about it today.

912
00:54:06,300 --> 00:54:09,700
Not the same way, yeah, exactly, and I think it's stupid to even say someone's a casual

913
00:54:09,700 --> 00:54:14,600
game player, it's just like, can you have a casual movie watcher, I mean, I'm sorry,

914
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:19,340
you're not, you know, skilled enough to watch this movie, but watch this other movie, it's,

915
00:54:19,340 --> 00:54:23,020
I don't know, it seems like a silly argument.

916
00:54:23,020 --> 00:54:27,140
So I did try to do some of the other weapons besides just the roller, because I like to

917
00:54:27,140 --> 00:54:33,180
play roller in Splatoon, and I can't stand playing Splatoon with motion controls, so

918
00:54:33,180 --> 00:54:36,460
thank God I was able to turn those off, but that turned into a whole debate on Twitter.

919
00:54:36,460 --> 00:54:41,060
I think it's because I play the roller, I don't enjoy motion controls, if I played something

920
00:54:41,060 --> 00:54:45,340
that needed more aim, because I did try to play that new dual weapon thing, and like,

921
00:54:45,340 --> 00:54:48,780
I was really horrible at aiming with it, and I was like, you know what, maybe this is why

922
00:54:48,780 --> 00:54:52,640
you need motion controls, because you can aim so much better with it, but like, when

923
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:57,000
I play with motion controls, I'm having to hit that reset, the Y button will like, reorient

924
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:00,240
the camera, I'm hitting that like, repeatedly, but again, with a roller, you don't really

925
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:04,980
have to aim the same way, I mean, you do for some things, but for the most part, you don't,

926
00:55:04,980 --> 00:55:10,040
so I don't know, I can get away with having motion controls off, but, eh, I don't know.

927
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:13,880
Still trying to shove it down your throat with the stupid motion controls, it's like

928
00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:16,040
you- I don't know if they're necessarily shoving

929
00:55:16,040 --> 00:55:21,840
it down your throat, then the fact that it does give you like, it's almost like it's

930
00:55:21,880 --> 00:55:26,160
a trackball, like, imagine the motion controls and using the tilt controls is more like using

931
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:29,840
a trackball, and I mean, you can turn it off if you don't like it lowkey, so I don't think

932
00:55:29,840 --> 00:55:34,680
they're necessarily shoving it down your throat, but it's like, a way to have something more-

933
00:55:34,680 --> 00:55:40,560
because you know, like a mouse, it's the whole keyboard and mouse versus a right analog stick,

934
00:55:40,560 --> 00:55:44,560
which I'm really noticing playing Mass Effect multiplayer, like I played a lot of Mass Effect

935
00:55:44,560 --> 00:55:50,280
multiplayer with 3 on the PC, and now it's like, I have the hardest time aiming on the

936
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:57,080
two analog nubs on Playstation, like I kind of need a mouse, and so I think the motion

937
00:55:57,080 --> 00:56:00,400
controls is to substitute for the mouse a little bit, even though yes, it's very very

938
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:04,480
different, it's not- I don't think it's what you think it is, Loki, when you say the forced

939
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:08,360
motion control thing, because it's just another way to be able to aim, basically.

940
00:56:08,360 --> 00:56:09,880
No, I understand, it's like Zelda.

941
00:56:09,880 --> 00:56:16,120
Yeah. So. Alright. Um, let's see, so that's it, I played a little Splatoon 2, I'm gonna

942
00:56:16,120 --> 00:56:19,680
check out the game when it comes out, I'll get the retail version, just to be able to

943
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:26,480
play with friends, because I hope, I mean, if it comes out that the matchmaking sucks,

944
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:30,560
then I might reconsider that, but you know, I guess that's kind of an unknown element

945
00:56:30,560 --> 00:56:34,640
right now, because I would have expected we would have had a hint as to what to expect

946
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:38,520
with the Nintendo app and all this stuff for the test fire this weekend, but none of that

947
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:42,320
was there, it was just, it was just, you got thrown in a match with random other people

948
00:56:42,320 --> 00:56:47,960
and that was that. So, I wanna hear a little bit more about how that's all gonna work,

949
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:53,400
I mean, I would imagine now that's gonna have to be in place for Mario Kart 8, right? Mario

950
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:59,720
Kart 8's gonna need that. I don't know, we'll see. I don't know, I don't know. Alex P. Carson

951
00:56:59,720 --> 00:57:03,840
in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com says, we're not gonna get into the mouse keyboard

952
00:57:03,840 --> 00:57:08,760
versus controller thing, it'll never end, ain't that the truth? Alright, we're gonna

953
00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:12,400
do at least one or two stories here, and then I gotta get to Dark Soccer and the classic

954
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:15,520
game of the week, because I said we'd call her at about 7, but oops, we ranted a little

955
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:18,720
too long in the beginning. So, we'll get to a couple stories here, but I do wanna do

956
00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:23,160
a quick housekeeping. Next week on the show, you don't even know this, Loki, surprise,

957
00:57:23,160 --> 00:57:27,920
Gabe's gonna be back next week to talk about SacIGDA and the Sac Indie Arcade, I'm hoping

958
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:31,720
Bree's gonna come too, I don't know if they're both coming or just him, but obviously they're

959
00:57:31,720 --> 00:57:35,440
both welcome, and who knows, maybe they'll bring another friend that's involved, but

960
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:41,840
we're gonna talk about the SacIGDA, Sac Indie Arcade, which is going to happen April 8th,

961
00:57:41,840 --> 00:57:45,000
so it's coming up, it's less than two weeks away. I know, I've been looking forward to

962
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:49,680
it. So that's coming up, and VOG will be broadcasting all day that Saturday, I'll let you know the

963
00:57:49,680 --> 00:57:53,740
times next week, because I'm not sure exactly when we'll start and when we'll end, but it's

964
00:57:53,740 --> 00:57:57,580
at the same venue we did last time, and so we were able to broadcast AOK, because they

965
00:57:57,580 --> 00:58:02,640
got us a wired, I remember we had to run a wire out a window and down, but we got a wired

966
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:06,120
connection there, so we were able to do the stream in OK, so I think we're in the exact

967
00:58:06,120 --> 00:58:09,880
same place we were last year, so if you are local in the Sacramento area, check it out,

968
00:58:09,880 --> 00:58:13,840
it's gonna be at the West Sacramento Convention Center on April 8th, so definitely come out

969
00:58:13,840 --> 00:58:16,400
and check that out. That's gonna be a very busy day for me, because I'm hosting Rocky

970
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:21,800
Horror that night, and you know what's funny? The after-party to the whole thing is at Cafe

971
00:58:21,800 --> 00:58:25,780
Colonial, the venue where the thing was at the first year, right? Now it's the after-party

972
00:58:25,780 --> 00:58:31,240
is there. Well, that's right next door to where we're doing Rocky Horror. So, the producer

973
00:58:31,240 --> 00:58:36,720
already knows, I'm gonna come on stage, tell my jokes, get things started, and then I'm

974
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:41,960
going next door to hang out while the movie's going, because I've seen the movie a million

975
00:58:41,960 --> 00:58:48,000
times, so anyway, that'll be a fun day, April 8th. OK, let's do some news. Loki, at least

976
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,840
let's get one story here, and then we'll probably get Dark Soccer on the line here.

977
00:58:50,840 --> 00:58:55,760
We can talk a little bit about the evil G, so GameStop is anticipating that there's gonna

978
00:58:55,760 --> 00:59:01,560
be shortage problems this year as well for the Nintendo Switch, and even for the PlayStation

979
00:59:01,560 --> 00:59:06,440
VR, so they're saying that the demand is incredibly strong for this, as soon as we get any in

980
00:59:06,440 --> 00:59:12,320
our stores, it's out within hours. We anticipate we're gonna be chasing supply this entire

981
00:59:12,320 --> 00:59:17,760
year. Of course, Nintendo has insisted that, no, they've got it worked out, but I guess

982
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:23,840
we'll have to see, and then of course, PlayStation VR. The PS4 levels, they're expecting that

983
00:59:23,840 --> 00:59:29,280
for the Scorpio launch, that it's gonna be, anticipation's higher or equal to the PlayStation

984
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:34,980
4 levels, so that's gonna be a problem too once that comes out. The other thing, which

985
00:59:34,980 --> 00:59:39,540
is kind of interesting, I guess GameStop's not doing all that well, or at least as well

986
00:59:39,540 --> 00:59:47,420
as they had hoped. They had a week, or holiday sales, so they're anticipating with that,

987
00:59:47,420 --> 00:59:55,180
that they're gonna be closing 150 stores across the US. So yeah, they dropped, the hardware

988
00:59:55,180 --> 01:00:03,900
sales dropped about 29%, and software down 19% as well, and I think a lot of that has

989
01:00:03,900 --> 01:00:07,820
to do with people buying digitally also. That probably has got to at least account

990
01:00:07,820 --> 01:00:08,820
for some of it.

991
01:00:08,820 --> 01:00:13,620
Well, it might also be some of the same retail stuff that's, you know what's interesting?

992
01:00:13,620 --> 01:00:17,300
I think on the show last week, I said something about how Sears and Kmart was gonna be the

993
01:00:17,300 --> 01:00:21,100
next thing to go away, and then did you know during last week, there was actually a story

994
01:00:21,100 --> 01:00:26,220
that came out that was like, Sears doesn't know if it actually came out that Sears said,

995
01:00:26,220 --> 01:00:28,740
we don't know if we're still gonna be here in a few years. They said something along

996
01:00:28,740 --> 01:00:32,940
those lines that made the investors freak out. So it was just kind of interesting that

997
01:00:32,940 --> 01:00:37,380
like, wow, I need to keep my mouth shut on OLR sometimes. But anyway, I wonder if some

998
01:00:37,380 --> 01:00:41,800
of that isn't coming into play too. Just more people are turning to online. Some of it digital,

999
01:00:41,800 --> 01:00:42,800
some of it Amazon.

1000
01:00:42,800 --> 01:00:46,220
Some of it like Amazon, exactly. Especially when you get this bullshit where you pre-order

1001
01:00:46,220 --> 01:00:51,780
something and you want it, and you can't get it from them because they're out of it. Especially

1002
01:00:51,780 --> 01:00:57,380
now Amazon's doing a lot of that Amazon Now, the Prime Now stuff, where if I wanted a Switch

1003
01:00:57,380 --> 01:01:02,180
and they happen to have it, I could order it and it'd be to my house in a couple hours

1004
01:01:02,180 --> 01:01:09,680
versus having to order it through GameStopper pre-order, whatever the case may be. But also

1005
01:01:09,680 --> 01:01:15,580
I think too, some of that is probably even hardware sales too. Like with the PlayStation

1006
01:01:15,580 --> 01:01:22,820
4 Pro coming out, people anticipating the Switch coming out, PlayStation VR coming out.

1007
01:01:22,820 --> 01:01:26,540
A lot of people probably weren't picking up as many games because they just dropped $400

1008
01:01:26,540 --> 01:01:32,120
on a new system. So that probably plays into it somewhat as well.

1009
01:01:32,120 --> 01:01:36,400
Do you think the GameStop's days are limited? Because I feel like we've seen this coming

1010
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:37,400
for a while now.

1011
01:01:37,400 --> 01:01:42,280
No, because you've got to have a channel for someone to sell hardware and all the other

1012
01:01:42,280 --> 01:01:47,920
stuff that digitally is just not going to work out. And also sometimes you can get better

1013
01:01:47,920 --> 01:01:53,680
deals there, especially with Nintendo, for example, not dropping the price of their games.

1014
01:01:53,680 --> 01:01:57,360
You may end up finding new stuff. They do have their place and they've also started

1015
01:01:57,360 --> 01:02:01,880
to see the writing on the wall a little bit and they're diversifying a lot more. So you're

1016
01:02:01,880 --> 01:02:08,620
seeing them get into more of like the toys and like hobby stuff, toys and apparel stuff.

1017
01:02:08,620 --> 01:02:13,280
So they are aware that they need to have more higher margin. That's the whole reasons they're

1018
01:02:13,280 --> 01:02:19,160
getting in higher margin items that are going to offset the drop in sales a little bit.

1019
01:02:19,160 --> 01:02:23,800
But they're always going to have, for one, they're still the biggest player in this.

1020
01:02:23,800 --> 01:02:28,240
And they're of course going to make sure that they're going to stay the biggest player by,

1021
01:02:28,240 --> 01:02:33,280
they have good control over these publishers. They fucking listen to when GameStop wants

1022
01:02:33,280 --> 01:02:37,280
them to do something. So until we get to that point where the publisher is like, well, we

1023
01:02:37,280 --> 01:02:40,440
don't need you anymore, but they do. So that's not going to ever happen.

1024
01:02:40,440 --> 01:02:45,380
Plus I imagine the used thing still does very well for GameStop because nobody else really

1025
01:02:45,380 --> 01:02:49,720
gets into that the same way, right? I mean, like I know others have tried. I know Best

1026
01:02:49,720 --> 01:02:53,840
Buy has tried. Amazon has a thing, but you know, when you think of buying used games,

1027
01:02:53,840 --> 01:02:57,960
you don't really think of Amazon, to be honest. Like I don't, can you even get used games?

1028
01:02:57,960 --> 01:02:59,680
I know you can trade them in, but what happens to them?

1029
01:02:59,680 --> 01:03:04,240
You can buy used games from Amazon. See, I just, I, I think people think more

1030
01:03:04,240 --> 01:03:08,520
about GameStop. I think GameStop still has done well in, in controlling that conversation

1031
01:03:08,520 --> 01:03:14,320
for better or for worse. The GameStop's credit, you with used games,

1032
01:03:14,320 --> 01:03:18,440
you kind of know what you're getting from when you go there. Like you, when you're buying

1033
01:03:18,440 --> 01:03:22,660
something on eBay or Amazon or something like that, you're not entirely sure what the quality

1034
01:03:22,660 --> 01:03:26,500
is going to be. I mean, they may have pictures and stuff, but at least with like GameStop,

1035
01:03:26,500 --> 01:03:30,420
you see the disc right in front of you. You can tell, okay, this looks like shit or, you

1036
01:03:30,420 --> 01:03:35,420
know, this is a bad condition. I mean, you kind of have that. Plus they have the quick,

1037
01:03:35,420 --> 01:03:39,260
you know, seven day warranty thing on it. So like if it does end up not working, I've

1038
01:03:39,260 --> 01:03:44,420
had that happen. You just take it right back and exchange it out without the hassle. So

1039
01:03:44,420 --> 01:03:47,180
I think it's a little bit more convenient in that sense, but yeah, I mean, there's other

1040
01:03:47,180 --> 01:03:50,740
places you're going to be able to find deals all over the place.

1041
01:03:50,740 --> 01:03:53,820
Now Bobby Black Wolf is pointing out in her chat room over at live.vognetwork.com that

1042
01:03:53,820 --> 01:03:58,300
Walmart is the biggest player and the evil G doesn't come close when it comes to, you

1043
01:03:58,300 --> 01:04:01,460
know, who's selling the games. I could, I could definitely see that, you know, depends

1044
01:04:01,460 --> 01:04:04,980
on your part of the country. See living here in California, we probably don't think of

1045
01:04:04,980 --> 01:04:09,080
that as much, even though Walmart's a big player here, it's probably something that's

1046
01:04:09,080 --> 01:04:10,580
much more apparent in other parts of the country.

1047
01:04:10,580 --> 01:04:14,540
They're a big retail player, but I think game wise, I think that they're doing more business

1048
01:04:14,540 --> 01:04:16,540
through GameStop. Really?

1049
01:04:16,540 --> 01:04:20,180
At least there was when I was working in the distribution business.

1050
01:04:20,180 --> 01:04:24,740
I was like, you got any receipts to back that up? Cause that's, even I'm having a hard time

1051
01:04:24,740 --> 01:04:25,740
doing that.

1052
01:04:25,740 --> 01:04:29,460
I can only, I can only go by what, what the reps said at the time. So then again, that

1053
01:04:29,460 --> 01:04:31,500
was three years ago. So who knows?

1054
01:04:31,500 --> 01:04:36,020
What is it? I will say this. It is, it is interesting. I would also believe that Walmart

1055
01:04:36,020 --> 01:04:38,940
is probably a bigger player than GameStop at the end of the day for what it's worth.

1056
01:04:38,940 --> 01:04:43,540
But it is interesting to me that most of the GameStops around here, if they're not in the

1057
01:04:43,540 --> 01:04:45,180
mall or in a Walmart parking lot.

1058
01:04:45,420 --> 01:04:46,420
Well, isn't that weird?

1059
01:04:46,420 --> 01:04:50,260
It is weird. Yeah. But the other thing too, let me look at like, if you want to talk about

1060
01:04:50,260 --> 01:04:54,460
who's the big players, I mean, look at, you know, who's getting exclusive DLC. It was

1061
01:04:54,460 --> 01:05:00,100
Walmart getting exclusive DLC or GameStop getting exclusive DLC. I mean, so that

1062
01:05:00,100 --> 01:05:03,420
Walmart gets a thing here and there, but okay. GameStop does get more.

1063
01:05:03,420 --> 01:05:07,340
They get quite a bit more and it's because they do a lot more marketing push for these

1064
01:05:07,340 --> 01:05:12,060
games as well. And a lot of people, I mean, they, people will go to Walmart, but they're

1065
01:05:12,060 --> 01:05:16,500
not going to necessarily, I don't think too many people are pre-ordering physically through

1066
01:05:16,500 --> 01:05:20,860
Walmart. Some people will. I mean, it usually, if they say that Walmart still does midnight

1067
01:05:20,860 --> 01:05:24,380
sales and stuff and does, I mean, so does Target. So does, you know, it just depends.

1068
01:05:24,380 --> 01:05:29,860
I think people now are starting to not necessarily rely as heavily on GameStop. They realize

1069
01:05:29,860 --> 01:05:36,180
that like, Oh, internet, I can, I can shop around now and it's a lot easier to shop around.

1070
01:05:36,180 --> 01:05:38,180
I think that's kind of what's hurting them more.

1071
01:05:38,300 --> 01:05:43,460
Well, Walmart certainly killed music stores and that, I mean, piracy really killed music

1072
01:05:43,460 --> 01:05:49,260
stores, but Walmart also had a huge hand in that too. So it's, it's interesting that GameStop

1073
01:05:49,260 --> 01:05:55,820
has persevered where a place like Tower Records or The Warehouse or whatever, you know,

1074
01:05:55,820 --> 01:06:02,260
music stores you can think of did not. So anyway, I do want to make sure we get to Dark

1075
01:06:02,260 --> 01:06:06,580
Sakura because she's patiently awaiting our call. So we're going to get her on the line

1076
01:06:06,620 --> 01:06:10,140
here and you can give us a call a little later in the show, but we're going to give Dark

1077
01:06:10,140 --> 01:06:13,940
Sakura's telephone a ring right now and get her on the show to check in with her. Cause

1078
01:06:13,940 --> 01:06:17,940
I know y'all are dying to hear her thoughts on Mass Effect Andromeda, as well as get into

1079
01:06:17,940 --> 01:06:22,420
the classic game of the week for tonight. And I'm hoping that she's near her phone cause

1080
01:06:22,420 --> 01:06:26,940
I'm about to get her voicemail. Even though I just checked in with her. All right, that

1081
01:06:26,940 --> 01:06:33,500
is bad. Cause she's not standing by your phone. Live radio. What can you do? Loki, you got

1082
01:06:33,500 --> 01:06:37,180
something short you can help fill time with here? Yeah, we can talk about the new classic

1083
01:06:37,180 --> 01:06:43,940
game of the week Halo. You bet that that's going to be your ass next week. So Nintendo

1084
01:06:43,940 --> 01:06:50,860
or I should say Reggie is promising that Nintendo is going to have a big E3 this year. And of

1085
01:06:50,860 --> 01:06:56,980
course his PR spin. E3 is always a big time for Nintendo. We look at each E3 as a unique

1086
01:06:56,980 --> 01:07:01,140
opportunity to tell our story. We're going to have a big E3 this year. We're showcasing

1087
01:07:01,140 --> 01:07:06,500
a variety of games, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, and some secrets

1088
01:07:06,500 --> 01:07:15,300
and 3DS. Yeah. This was an interview they had with Fox News. Are they going to do a

1089
01:07:15,300 --> 01:07:20,980
press conference thingy again? Probably. They're, they're not going to be, um, I don't think

1090
01:07:20,980 --> 01:07:25,300
they're actually, well, I mean, they didn't really say they're going to have a press conference,

1091
01:07:25,300 --> 01:07:31,300
but I think they're probably going to do the directs. So, I don't know. I know E3 or

1092
01:07:31,300 --> 01:07:35,980
EA is not going to be at E3 again. They're going to be doing their little, like we're,

1093
01:07:35,980 --> 01:07:39,860
we're doing E3, but at the same time as E3, but not really at E3. Oh, is that what they're

1094
01:07:39,860 --> 01:07:44,620
playing this year? That's what they're doing. Um, as I alluded to earlier in the show, when

1095
01:07:44,620 --> 01:07:49,300
I made fun of Mass Effect Andromeda, I was saying that this was actually coming from

1096
01:07:49,300 --> 01:07:54,740
Nintendo. So there's been some issue with Joy-Cons and they're having some issues, not

1097
01:07:54,740 --> 01:08:00,780
syncing or disconnecting because of some manufacturing variations, as Nintendo puts

1098
01:08:00,780 --> 01:08:08,080
it. So people have found, um, you know, that when they've come back being fixed from Nintendo,

1099
01:08:08,080 --> 01:08:12,420
that now they're adding this like piece of conductive foam in there that's supposed to

1100
01:08:12,420 --> 01:08:17,340
help with the signal or something like that. But yeah, they said there's no issue or no

1101
01:08:17,340 --> 01:08:23,300
design issue with the Joy-Con controllers and no widespread, um, proactive repair or

1102
01:08:23,300 --> 01:08:29,060
replacement effort is underway. And manufacturing variation has resulted in wireless interference

1103
01:08:29,060 --> 01:08:34,860
with a small number of left Joy-Cons. Moving forward, this will not be an issue as manufacturing

1104
01:08:34,860 --> 01:08:38,580
variation has been addressed.

1105
01:08:38,580 --> 01:08:43,100
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com,

1106
01:08:43,100 --> 01:08:46,220
use the passphrase, black.

1107
01:08:46,220 --> 01:08:49,180
Let me, uh, I hate to do this. I got to do it. There's no other way I can do this to

1108
01:08:49,180 --> 01:08:53,620
do this live. She's saying it's not ringing for her, um, for some reason. So I'm just

1109
01:08:53,620 --> 01:08:56,060
making sure that our phone is actually working. So what I'm doing right now is I'm actually

1110
01:08:56,060 --> 01:09:01,900
calling my own cell phone here, live on air. Okay. It's ringing. So I know I can call out.

1111
01:09:01,900 --> 01:09:05,600
So we're going to, we're going to try to do this again. That was my cell phone. So let's

1112
01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:10,180
try this one more time with Dark Sakura. Maybe she was trying to call us as we were calling

1113
01:09:10,180 --> 01:09:16,260
her, but we're going to see if it rings now. It's not even okay. There it is. What are

1114
01:09:16,260 --> 01:09:21,540
you eating? And I think, hello, hi, dark soccer. There you are. It rained this time.

1115
01:09:21,540 --> 01:09:25,340
There you go. Yeah, it's weird. We're having phone problems, but, uh, hooray. You're here.

1116
01:09:25,340 --> 01:09:32,940
How are you? How are you feeling? Um, I hurt, but I'm okay. Usually hanging in there. Yeah,

1117
01:09:32,940 --> 01:09:39,160
I, uh, I don't recommend to anybody to get kidney stones. Just don't do it. I'm not sure

1118
01:09:39,160 --> 01:09:43,260
it's something that'll just sound device in your house. I don't think, uh, you, you really

1119
01:09:43,260 --> 01:09:49,080
get a choice in the matter usually. Well, yeah, that's true, but it's the worst pain

1120
01:09:49,080 --> 01:09:55,440
I've ever felt in my life. Well, feel better. I hope, uh, I hope everything passes with

1121
01:09:55,440 --> 01:10:03,960
minimal pain. Um, so, uh, at the top of the show. Okay. So we spent like 45 minutes talking

1122
01:10:03,960 --> 01:10:07,380
about mass effect and drama tonight. And by the way, dark soccer, I hope you can hear

1123
01:10:07,380 --> 01:10:10,580
the show at some point. I think it'd be very proud of Loki tonight. Some of the things

1124
01:10:10,580 --> 01:10:14,820
he said, but anyway, I'll leave it at that. But the, uh, our listenership is dying to

1125
01:10:14,820 --> 01:10:19,240
know what are your thoughts early on with mass effect Andromeda? I'm pretty happy with

1126
01:10:19,240 --> 01:10:25,700
it actually. Although the character creation is derp, tastic, and I'm waiting for the modders

1127
01:10:25,700 --> 01:10:33,640
to step up their game. Um, for the most part, I really enjoyed all the characters. Um, there

1128
01:10:33,640 --> 01:10:39,640
just been certain things that I've rolled my eyes at just, you know, in game stuff that

1129
01:10:40,080 --> 01:10:44,940
one would know as a person living in their universe. I'm like, well, this isn't revisionist

1130
01:10:44,940 --> 01:10:51,940
history. Um, I, I was kind of thinking of going after the Turian lady, but I don't know.

1131
01:10:51,940 --> 01:10:57,940
She's a little bit more bestie and, you know, I don't want to do like a Garrett's replacement.

1132
01:10:57,940 --> 01:11:03,540
So, uh, it's, but she's been cool. She's been like her and Drack are my favorite characters

1133
01:11:03,540 --> 01:11:09,180
so far. So I like the Turian and the Krogan. All right. Good, good. What about one thing

1134
01:11:09,180 --> 01:11:12,320
we spent a lot of time talking about where some of the bugs that are going on with the

1135
01:11:12,320 --> 01:11:16,160
game, are you, are you encountering, are you encountering bugs? Is it, I mean, you mentioned

1136
01:11:16,160 --> 01:11:19,360
the character creators kind of derpy, but are you, are you running into bugs that are

1137
01:11:19,360 --> 01:11:26,360
ruining it for you? I actually had to adjust my, um, my, uh, graphic settings a few times,

1138
01:11:27,120 --> 01:11:31,440
um, because it would like freeze in certain parts of the dialogue and then the mouse would

1139
01:11:31,440 --> 01:11:38,440
keep moving. So I was getting that issue happening, um, and a little bit of jerkiness. Weird.

1140
01:11:38,860 --> 01:11:45,140
But um, you know, and there, there actually were a few, um, I wouldn't call it a bug,

1141
01:11:45,140 --> 01:11:51,740
but it's just a weird animation issue as like if you go up to talk to a character and you

1142
01:11:51,740 --> 01:11:55,780
approach them at just the wrong angle, of course the camera tries to move over your

1143
01:11:55,780 --> 01:12:00,620
shoulder and then you just got the character there continuing whatever animation they were

1144
01:12:00,620 --> 01:12:05,460
doing beforehand, you know, or whatever cycle of animation, instead of having them just

1145
01:12:05,480 --> 01:12:12,480
turn and talk to you. So it's like, I'm talking to you, but I'm also scanning this thing and

1146
01:12:12,480 --> 01:12:17,920
doing an interpretive dance. Yeah. So there's, that's sort of how it came out. There's some

1147
01:12:17,920 --> 01:12:21,480
weird things that maybe if it, maybe if they'd waited just a little longer to release the

1148
01:12:21,480 --> 01:12:24,800
game, they could have, um, worked out, but then we would have had to wait longer to play

1149
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:29,160
the game. So I don't know. I would have been fine with that. Yeah. All right. That's, that's

1150
01:12:29,160 --> 01:12:33,440
fair. I think, uh, and a lot of people in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com

1151
01:12:33,440 --> 01:12:37,780
have been invoking the good old Miyamoto quote in our chat room about how a bad game

1152
01:12:37,780 --> 01:12:43,340
is bad forever, but a good game. Nobody remembers that it gets delayed. Just like Zelda people,

1153
01:12:43,340 --> 01:12:48,260
you know, that game was supposed to be out. I think originally it was like a holiday 2015

1154
01:12:48,260 --> 01:12:52,620
game, wasn't it? And then they pushed it back several times. Yeah. To make it, to make it

1155
01:12:52,620 --> 01:12:57,500
happen. But now nobody cares cause Zelda's awesome. Well, we've seen both of the endings

1156
01:12:57,500 --> 01:13:02,900
for that now. Yeah. It was good. Yeah, it was pretty good. I mean, you've got to get

1157
01:13:02,900 --> 01:13:07,800
all of the memories and a few other things to get like the true ending. But one thing

1158
01:13:07,800 --> 01:13:12,000
that disappointed me about that is that I was kind of under the impression that after

1159
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:17,240
you beat the games and you've got more game, you know, like, like post end game stuff.

1160
01:13:17,240 --> 01:13:21,860
Um, and instead it doesn't quite work out that way, which I would have liked to have

1161
01:13:21,860 --> 01:13:27,680
like the whole post game rebuilding Hyrule thing, but it's not meant to be. Maybe that's

1162
01:13:27,680 --> 01:13:33,120
the DLC. We'll see. Maybe. See, that was, it was the whole existence of DLC is what

1163
01:13:33,120 --> 01:13:38,700
made me think that might be it, but oh well. All right. Well, we're going to, we're going

1164
01:13:38,700 --> 01:13:44,700
to go back to a more classic time when there wasn't any DLC. You know what? The game came

1165
01:13:44,700 --> 01:13:49,860
out and it is what it is. Either you like it or you don't. It's the classic game. And

1166
01:13:49,860 --> 01:13:56,360
then you had to go stand in line to do a return and then find your receipt. Uh, dark soccer

1167
01:13:56,420 --> 01:14:00,140
is going to jump into the gaming vault and find a game that she thinks, Hey, you guys

1168
01:14:00,140 --> 01:14:05,480
should be playing this game this week. If you don't, you are ignorant and you've picked.

1169
01:14:05,480 --> 01:14:09,360
I, this is one of those games this week where I'm like, this is a 10 year old game. Yes,

1170
01:14:09,360 --> 01:14:14,720
of course it is. Oh my gosh. I can't believe this qualifies 11 year old game. All right.

1171
01:14:14,720 --> 01:14:18,040
Dark soccer. What is the classic? And it is a classic. What is the classic game of the

1172
01:14:18,040 --> 01:14:25,040
week? Cooking mama. I decided to pick cooking mama and part of this, I am actually going

1173
01:14:26,400 --> 01:14:32,840
to say thank you to Game Tim who I found on YouTube who does the cooking with cooking

1174
01:14:32,840 --> 01:14:39,840
mama and we have chatted a little bit back and forth on Twitter and I would like to welcome

1175
01:14:40,480 --> 01:14:45,520
them as a listener to the show. So thank you for listening to us. Um, love to have them

1176
01:14:45,520 --> 01:14:50,660
on the show, but going back into the game, uh, it is cooking mama, which came out in

1177
01:14:50,660 --> 01:14:57,660
Japan on March 23rd, 2006 and in North America, September 12th, 2006. Sorry, my voice is still

1178
01:14:59,420 --> 01:15:04,900
a little icky today. Um, it was published by Taiko, um, in Japan, in the U S it was

1179
01:15:04,900 --> 01:15:11,900
by Majesco and, and how regions five Oh five games. It was awarded IDN's best of E3 award

1180
01:15:13,420 --> 01:15:20,420
for 2006. You want to know what's funny? We were at 2006, um, E3. We were, that was the

1181
01:15:21,100 --> 01:15:26,700
Paris Hilton year. Oh yeah, that's, that's brilliant. We started on that and we call,

1182
01:15:26,700 --> 01:15:32,820
we call it that because we had to walk a completely different direction because Paris Hilton was

1183
01:15:32,820 --> 01:15:37,580
at the booth and heaven forbid we get too close to a celebrity we don't give a fuck

1184
01:15:37,580 --> 01:15:43,060
about and it was like, Hey, I did meet John Cena and that was cool. We were walking like

1185
01:15:43,060 --> 01:15:47,260
behind and it wasn't like it was like we were walking behind a wall where she might've been

1186
01:15:47,260 --> 01:15:50,380
on the other side. It was so frustrating, but it was also more people are remembered

1187
01:15:50,420 --> 01:15:55,420
as the year that we was unveiled the last big year before the airport years. But anyway,

1188
01:15:55,420 --> 01:16:02,420
yes. Well anyway, in cooking mama as one might guess it has to do with cooking. Basically

1189
01:16:02,660 --> 01:16:08,860
follow the instructions that mama gives you. Um, you use your stylus on the 3DS to do different

1190
01:16:08,860 --> 01:16:15,300
tasks. Like you could chop the vegetables and slice meat or flip food or even down to

1191
01:16:15,340 --> 01:16:21,340
your plating of your food. So that's, I mean, I thought that didn't touch as well, but you've

1192
01:16:21,340 --> 01:16:27,740
also have kind of mundane tasks like pouring the water and things like that. And it's got

1193
01:16:27,740 --> 01:16:34,740
different recipes that you can make as well. Um, in fact, some of the mechanics and the

1194
01:16:35,060 --> 01:16:39,580
little mini games kind of make me think of how music games go, like where they have you

1195
01:16:39,580 --> 01:16:46,580
do things a certain way or cut across a certain way, kind of like, um, um, you know, where

1196
01:16:49,580 --> 01:16:56,580
it moves across the screen a certain way. So it's got kind of that in there too, but

1197
01:16:56,580 --> 01:17:03,580
now you can, with the 3DS, you actually have to use the first part of the screen to show

1198
01:17:04,340 --> 01:17:10,260
you your instructions for doing what you have to do on the bottom screen. So if you screw

1199
01:17:10,260 --> 01:17:17,060
up or if the time expires without making enough progress, then it's considered a failure.

1200
01:17:17,060 --> 01:17:22,980
And then you get mama pissed off with the caption that says, don't worry, mama will

1201
01:17:22,980 --> 01:17:29,980
fix it. And basically as you perform each of the tasks in the mini games, your performance

1202
01:17:30,700 --> 01:17:37,700
is rated by the time you get to the end of that level. And you can make all kinds of

1203
01:17:37,700 --> 01:17:42,700
interesting dishes in the game. Now, the let's cook part, honestly, I think I like the food

1204
01:17:42,700 --> 01:17:49,700
prep part better than the let's cook part just because, um, the cooking part is, it

1205
01:17:50,700 --> 01:17:54,700
seems a little subjective and it doesn't always make sense to me. Like, turn it down, turn

1206
01:17:54,700 --> 01:17:57,700
it up, turn it down, turn it up. Like, make up your mind. You're supposed to do it all

1207
01:17:58,700 --> 01:18:05,700
at certain times anyway. And like, some of the ingredients are kind of bizarre to me,

1208
01:18:06,700 --> 01:18:12,700
but hey, it is what it is. Like, I don't put cucumbers on a sandwich. Um, and then you

1209
01:18:12,700 --> 01:18:18,700
can, um, you know, basically it's just all these different modes in that you combine

1210
01:18:18,700 --> 01:18:23,700
things, you cook things, you chop things, like bring skills like peeling and stewing

1211
01:18:23,700 --> 01:18:29,700
and all of that. And some of the dishes in the game, honestly enough, are really pretty

1212
01:18:29,700 --> 01:18:36,700
good. Um, I may or may not have used a couple of inspirations in the past, although I'll

1213
01:18:37,700 --> 01:18:44,700
be honest, I've gone back and looked up other recipes myself. So, um, Cooking Mama was actually

1214
01:18:44,700 --> 01:18:51,700
considered kind of average, um, when it released. Um, Famitsu gave it a 28 out of 40. Um, it

1215
01:18:52,700 --> 01:18:58,700
was, though, considered to be a great title for being a budget title. Um, it was $20 at

1216
01:18:58,700 --> 01:19:05,700
release, it was pretty inexpensive and a very solid and replayable game. Um, and it really

1217
01:19:06,700 --> 01:19:11,700
is something that you can sit down and play casually. Like, you can do a few recipes here

1218
01:19:11,700 --> 01:19:17,700
and then save it, and then do a few recipes other and save it. So, um, the first game

1219
01:19:17,700 --> 01:19:23,700
Cooking Mama made, uh, they actually sold over 500,000 copies in the US, and, um, that's

1220
01:19:24,700 --> 01:19:31,700
as of August 15th, 2007, and over a million in the TAO regions. So, um, and believe it

1221
01:19:32,700 --> 01:19:36,700
or not, Miley Cyrus was a big fan of the series. She came in like a Cooking Mama.

1222
01:19:37,700 --> 01:19:38,700
That's so random.

1223
01:19:39,700 --> 01:19:43,700
Now, here's the fun thing. You remember, cause we even made fun of this on the show, when

1224
01:19:44,700 --> 01:19:45,700
PETA had their, their panties in a bunch over it.

1225
01:19:45,700 --> 01:19:46,700
Yes, I do remember that.

1226
01:19:47,700 --> 01:19:54,700
It was Cooking Mama, Mama kills animals. And so, the press release response was hilarious.

1227
01:19:55,700 --> 01:20:01,700
It's Mama saying, I would never put rat in my ratatouille, and pointed out the vegetarian

1228
01:20:02,700 --> 01:20:07,700
recipes. And then PETA kinda got their panties unplifted when Gardening Mama came out.

1229
01:20:08,700 --> 01:20:10,700
So, I know, right?

1230
01:20:11,700 --> 01:20:12,700
It's funny.

1231
01:20:12,700 --> 01:20:19,700
So, there, there were sequels. Um, one of, um, one of them was Cooking Mama Cook-Off.

1232
01:20:20,700 --> 01:20:24,700
It came out, um, for the Wii, and it used the Wiimote for the cooking, kinda like how

1233
01:20:25,700 --> 01:20:28,700
the, uh, the surgery, the surgery game, by the way, stopped using the Wiimote, I'm just

1234
01:20:29,700 --> 01:20:34,700
saying. And then we got another DS game, which is Cooking Mama to Dinner with Friends.

1235
01:20:35,700 --> 01:20:40,700
And it has, like, different mini-games and other modes. On top of that, it has Mama speaking

1236
01:20:40,700 --> 01:20:46,700
with a very, very thick accent. So, um, there's also Cooking Mama World Kitchen for Wii.

1237
01:20:47,700 --> 01:20:53,700
Um, and then there is another DS sequel, Cooking Mama 3 Stop and Chop, um, that came out, um,

1238
01:20:54,700 --> 01:20:59,700
in October 2009. Uh, Mama has been in other games too, like Babysitting Mama. Did you see

1239
01:21:00,700 --> 01:21:01,700
that baby thing that comes with it? It's creepy.

1240
01:21:02,700 --> 01:21:03,700
Yeah, it's super creepy.

1241
01:21:04,700 --> 01:21:06,700
And then Crafty Mama, Gardening Mama.

1242
01:21:07,700 --> 01:21:09,700
Where she teaches you, she teaches you how to cook crack.

1243
01:21:10,700 --> 01:21:17,700
And then Gardening Mama 2, Forest Friends. There is also Cooking Mama 4, Kitchen Magic

1244
01:21:18,700 --> 01:21:24,700
for the 3DS, and Cooking Mama 5, Bon Appetit. And there's also kind of a pseudo-sequel called

1245
01:21:25,700 --> 01:21:32,700
Cooking Mama Sweet Shop that was on the 3DS as well. Um, now, what I would like to stop

1246
01:21:33,700 --> 01:21:40,700
and reference for a moment is that it, believe it or not, it kind of has gameplay items in

1247
01:21:41,700 --> 01:21:48,700
common with a Super Nintendo era game. And that game was called, um, Multiple-Chan No

1248
01:21:50,700 --> 01:21:55,700
Wonder Kitchen. And I had to bring this up because I actually have played a little bit

1249
01:21:56,700 --> 01:22:01,700
of this game. I had it on an emulator way back in the day and I was like, eh, it's cute.

1250
01:22:02,700 --> 01:22:07,700
Basically, Multiple-Chan No Wonder Kitchen, um, was one of those advertising games, you

1251
01:22:08,700 --> 01:22:15,700
know, like how Joki Doki Panic was and all that. It was sponsored by, um, Aji no Moto,

1252
01:22:16,700 --> 01:22:22,700
um, the company that does, like, they sell, like, MSD additive and, and like some brands

1253
01:22:23,700 --> 01:22:28,700
of dashi. They're basically kitchen, uh, condiments. And this game came out in 1993 for the

1254
01:22:28,700 --> 01:22:34,700
Super Famicom. It was cut in, uh, sorry, point and click. And you even got, like, seals

1255
01:22:35,700 --> 01:22:40,700
for their brand of mayonnaise or something to get the game. Um, but the cooking aspect

1256
01:22:41,700 --> 01:22:46,700
of the game, the meal preparation is more than a little bit similar to Cooking Mama

1257
01:22:47,700 --> 01:22:51,700
and it makes me think that that was where the idea for Cooking Mama came from, if that

1258
01:22:52,700 --> 01:22:57,700
makes sense. Yeah. Now, I'm trying to find some of the Cooking Mama recipes so I can

1259
01:22:58,700 --> 01:23:04,700
tell you what's in there because it actually, it's fairly international. Um, I, I will say

1260
01:23:05,700 --> 01:23:12,700
from all of the, um, uh, watching Cooking with Dog and, uh, you know, just my own hunt

1261
01:23:13,700 --> 01:23:23,700
down of recipes and what I know about Japanese cooking is that, um, it, um, really is very

1262
01:23:23,700 --> 01:23:29,700
still, I'd say, Japanese oriented for the style of cooking and ingredients. Um, but

1263
01:23:30,700 --> 01:23:34,700
I was trying, hopefully trying to find some of the, the recipes in it. Like, I know that

1264
01:23:35,700 --> 01:23:43,700
you can do Salisbury steak or potato salad or, um, pizza. Um, and then of course there's,

1265
01:23:44,700 --> 01:23:50,700
uh, okonomiyaki I think was one. You can do instant ramen. But, but the best part, the

1266
01:23:50,700 --> 01:23:56,700
best part Dark Saga is when you fuck up the food, what happens? Mama has to fix it. Don't

1267
01:23:57,700 --> 01:24:03,700
worry, Mama will fix it. Exactly right. Ok, so here's, here's some of the other episodes

1268
01:24:04,700 --> 01:24:08,700
in here. So you can do, um, ogakodon in there, which is like one of my favorite ever Japanese

1269
01:24:09,700 --> 01:24:15,700
dishes. Although it calls it chicken and egg rice bowl. You have, uh, chicken and tomato

1270
01:24:15,700 --> 01:24:22,700
sauce. You have wontons, you have soba, uh, agidashi doku is in it. You get a US one.

1271
01:24:23,700 --> 01:24:27,700
So there's all kinds of stuff. It's really great. And yeah, but, but can Mama fix my

1272
01:24:28,700 --> 01:24:34,700
life? Cause it's pretty broken. I don't think your life is broken. Tiny Mama. You did even

1273
01:24:35,700 --> 01:24:42,700
better than Mama. That's very sweet of you to say. It doesn't affect it when. Alright.

1274
01:24:43,700 --> 01:24:48,700
You give me Mama to fix America. Anything else to say about Cookie Mama, the game of

1275
01:24:49,700 --> 01:24:54,700
the week? I am super hungry and I'm actually going to be making something tonight in my

1276
01:24:55,700 --> 01:24:59,700
kitchen. There, oh, well, and if you fuck it up, don't worry, Dan will have to clean

1277
01:25:00,700 --> 01:25:07,700
it up. Dan will fix it. No, I'm a good cook. I'm making, um, uh, nut bread. Mmm, yummy.

1278
01:25:07,700 --> 01:25:11,700
We'll save some for next week. We have guests here in studio next week, so save some. We'll

1279
01:25:12,700 --> 01:25:16,700
see about, we'll see about that. Alright. Alright, well, uh, Dark Saga is joining us

1280
01:25:17,700 --> 01:25:21,700
and that was the classic game of the week, Cooking Mama, um, available on the 3DS, which

1281
01:25:22,700 --> 01:25:25,700
I'm sure a lot of you guys have played. If you haven't, you should go check it out and

1282
01:25:26,700 --> 01:25:30,700
don't worry if you fuck it up, Mama will fix it. One last little thing that I think is

1283
01:25:31,700 --> 01:25:35,700
worth mentioning. You know that, um, uh, ragtime piano player whose site reads video game

1284
01:25:35,700 --> 01:25:41,700
music? Yeah. There's one of him doing the Cooking Mama theme. Oh, that's funny. Yeah,

1285
01:25:42,700 --> 01:25:44,700
cause you can kind of hear that in the background. It's really cool. It's like a ragtime piano

1286
01:25:45,700 --> 01:25:50,700
theme that plays during the whole game. Exactly, so it's, it's, and once he starts doing improvisation

1287
01:25:51,700 --> 01:25:55,700
it's amazing, but I think that's worth a listen as well. Very cool. Alright, well, Dark

1288
01:25:56,700 --> 01:25:58,700
Saga, I'm going to let you go so we can get to break, but, uh, feel better, okay, and

1289
01:25:59,700 --> 01:26:03,700
then, uh, have fun cooking tonight. Thank you, have fun breaking things. We will, bye.

1290
01:26:03,700 --> 01:26:07,700
Alright, we're going to go ahead and take a break. Uh, when we come back though, with

1291
01:26:08,700 --> 01:26:11,700
more of Orange Lounge Radio, lots more news because we barely scratched the surface on

1292
01:26:12,700 --> 01:26:14,700
news, right? So we have a lot more news to come up. Yes. When we come back to the show

1293
01:26:15,700 --> 01:26:19,700
and of course your calls as well, uh, over Orange Lounge Radio on Skype and we will get

1294
01:26:20,700 --> 01:26:22,700
to the mailbag as well. I know we have at least one email we got to get to tonight.

1295
01:26:23,700 --> 01:26:25,700
There might've been more too, so we'll get to all that when we come back after this break

1296
01:26:26,700 --> 01:26:27,700
with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1297
01:26:27,700 --> 01:26:39,700
And welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio. Live tonight, episode number 681 for

1298
01:26:40,700 --> 01:26:46,700
March 26th of 2017. If you're just joining us over at VOG Network, you missed a fun little

1299
01:26:47,700 --> 01:26:50,700
spirited discussion about Mass Effect Andromeda at the beginning of the show and talking

1300
01:26:51,700 --> 01:26:54,700
about some other games from this week. Talking a little bit about Nintendo needing to amp

1301
01:26:54,700 --> 01:26:58,700
up supplies to the Switch and some of the things the GameStop's going through this week.

1302
01:26:59,700 --> 01:27:03,700
But we've got some more news to come, right, Loki? Yes we do. So we can talk a little bit

1303
01:27:04,700 --> 01:27:08,700
about rumors because everybody loves rumors. Yay! Rumor has it. And these are all, these

1304
01:27:09,700 --> 01:27:13,700
are all Activision rumors. Oh boy. So, uh, the first one, which actually I believe did

1305
01:27:14,700 --> 01:27:17,700
get confirmed, was that Destiny 2 was supposed to be out in September. When we say got

1306
01:27:18,700 --> 01:27:21,700
confirmed, like Activision said? I want to say I saw on Twitter there was someone that

1307
01:27:21,700 --> 01:27:27,700
was in the know, I can't remember who it was, this was a while ago, I saw this on,

1308
01:27:28,700 --> 01:27:32,700
someone saw, it was a poster that got leaked out there, and then there was someone that

1309
01:27:33,700 --> 01:27:42,700
did confirm. Way to ruin E3. There was going to be an announcement. So, yeah, interesting.

1310
01:27:43,700 --> 01:27:48,700
So Destiny 2, that'll be something we can hopefully expect this year. So in September.

1311
01:27:48,700 --> 01:27:52,700
In September. Cool. And this is according to a poster. And that's the whole, we knew

1312
01:27:53,700 --> 01:27:55,700
it was coming because they had that whole discussion about that you can't transfer your

1313
01:27:56,700 --> 01:27:59,700
characters, anything besides like cosmetic stuff. And we knew it was coming this year

1314
01:28:00,700 --> 01:28:03,700
because they did announce that it was coming in the fall. Yeah. So, I mean, it makes sense

1315
01:28:04,700 --> 01:28:10,700
because Destiny 1 came out in September, so, sure. But that was, god, almost three, four

1316
01:28:11,700 --> 01:28:14,700
years ago at this point, right? Has it been that long? It has been a little while. It's

1317
01:28:14,700 --> 01:28:18,700
been over a year, probably three years ago. Probably three years ago. The other rumor

1318
01:28:19,700 --> 01:28:26,700
is another also promotional piece, and this is a promotional poster or something for Call

1319
01:28:27,700 --> 01:28:34,700
of Duty World War II. So kind of saying that this would take Call of Duty back to its roots,

1320
01:28:35,700 --> 01:28:41,700
so kind of pulling a fucking, you know, EA and Battlefield 1, you know, now let's take

1321
01:28:41,700 --> 01:28:46,700
it back because our modern or future warfare shit just ain't flying. Let's just take it

1322
01:28:47,700 --> 01:28:50,700
back to modern warfare. Let's just go back to our roots. Just go back to modern warfare,

1323
01:28:51,700 --> 01:28:54,700
just do a modern warfare four. Let's just go back and punch some Nazis in the face.

1324
01:28:55,700 --> 01:29:01,700
And just do it. World War II, Call of Duty was still fun, so I'm down to check that out.

1325
01:29:02,700 --> 01:29:06,700
I do like the modern warfare games, though, because I got spoiled after I played, you

1326
01:29:06,700 --> 01:29:11,700
know, the old ones, so we'll see. I'm curious. Stoppy in chat says, I do miss World War II

1327
01:29:12,700 --> 01:29:15,700
shooters. So there you go. Yeah, and everyone was sick of them for a while. It just proves

1328
01:29:16,700 --> 01:29:21,700
you got to, like, give it some time, you know, space that shit out. All right. Some other

1329
01:29:22,700 --> 01:29:25,700
stuff we can talk about. Let's talk about Sony. So there's another rumor coming out

1330
01:29:26,700 --> 01:29:30,700
that they're prepping yet another revision of the PlayStation 4. So apparently there's

1331
01:29:30,700 --> 01:29:35,700
going to be an even slimmer model that's going to be coming out. And this is coming

1332
01:29:36,700 --> 01:29:42,700
from Digitimes saying that they're prepping a thinner version of the PlayStation 4. This

1333
01:29:43,700 --> 01:29:47,700
is not unlike Sony because they did revisions on the PlayStation 2 and 3 a few times.

1334
01:29:48,700 --> 01:29:51,700
I know three went through at least two revisions and even Microsoft did the same thing

1335
01:29:52,700 --> 01:29:57,700
with the Xbox 360. So it makes sense. What I what I would be curious about would be

1336
01:29:57,700 --> 01:30:02,700
would this slimmer version get the pro specs? Could this be a slim pro? Or is the

1337
01:30:04,700 --> 01:30:09,700
PlayStation Pro kind of like it's already over? But okay. Now, one thing I know we

1338
01:30:10,700 --> 01:30:12,700
talked a lot about Mass Effect Andromeda at the beginning of the show. But one thing,

1339
01:30:13,700 --> 01:30:16,700
you know, I need to mention some positives, you know, because I talk about the story

1340
01:30:17,700 --> 01:30:20,700
still really good, the exploration. But one of the other like big positives is that

1341
01:30:21,700 --> 01:30:25,700
it's really gorgeous. Like a lot of the scenery that you go through and the backgrounds

1342
01:30:25,700 --> 01:30:29,700
I mean, it's like when you're in some of these vaults that you go into is fucking

1343
01:30:30,700 --> 01:30:34,700
gorgeous. And yeah, I've been playing this on a PlayStation 4 Pro. Granted, I don't

1344
01:30:35,700 --> 01:30:38,700
have a 4K TV. So yeah, I don't know why I own a pro either. I guess I was hoping to

1345
01:30:39,700 --> 01:30:43,700
get those increased frame rates. But for what it's worth in Andromeda, it's been a

1346
01:30:44,700 --> 01:30:47,700
smooth experience, even though, you know, there's been some of those bugs that we

1347
01:30:48,700 --> 01:30:52,700
talked about, like everything still renders really smooth and so forth. So I'm kind

1348
01:30:52,700 --> 01:30:57,700
of curious if maybe if PlayStation is going to slim things down again, might the

1349
01:30:58,700 --> 01:31:01,700
pro specs be a new standard, especially if this is something that's going to happen

1350
01:31:02,700 --> 01:31:05,700
towards the end of the year? You know, the price of the technology should have come

1351
01:31:06,700 --> 01:31:12,700
down, right? I would hope, yeah. It'll be interesting to see. Yeah. Let's talk about

1352
01:31:13,700 --> 01:31:18,700
Blizzard, I should say. It's also sort of Activision. Sort of. So they got this whole

1353
01:31:18,700 --> 01:31:23,700
remaster of Starcraft coming out this summer. So I haven't actually heard about

1354
01:31:24,700 --> 01:31:27,700
this yet, but apparently the remastered version is going to include all the same

1355
01:31:28,700 --> 01:31:32,700
content from the original game, including the Brood War expansion. And they're

1356
01:31:33,700 --> 01:31:38,700
going to give it a graphical overhaul with 4K Ultra HD updated audio and matchmaking

1357
01:31:39,700 --> 01:31:43,700
support. And they're saying that they are also doing new illustrations to enhance

1358
01:31:43,700 --> 01:31:49,700
the storytelling during the camping missions and cloud saves and custom made maps

1359
01:31:50,700 --> 01:31:54,700
and key binds and all that fun stuff. You know, this was rumored during the last

1360
01:31:55,700 --> 01:31:58,700
BlizzCon, which was a little bit, you know, it was kind of a lackluster BlizzCon.

1361
01:31:59,700 --> 01:32:02,700
They didn't really announce a lot of big, big stuff besides what the Overwatch League,

1362
01:32:03,700 --> 01:32:06,700
which we still don't even know much about, the Diablo Necromancer when everybody

1363
01:32:07,700 --> 01:32:12,700
wanted an expansion or Diablo 4. But anyway, so the Starcraft remaster was

1364
01:32:13,700 --> 01:32:16,700
rumored a few months ago. It's interesting. They chose to announce it now. I

1365
01:32:17,700 --> 01:32:20,700
understand there was a, there was an event in Korea that they did this at, right?

1366
01:32:21,700 --> 01:32:23,700
There's like an I heart Starcraft thing. And there's another cool thing too, is

1367
01:32:24,700 --> 01:32:28,700
like with Brood War, they're also patching that they're doing an update. 1.18 is

1368
01:32:29,700 --> 01:32:33,700
going to actually add some more bug features, improvements, and even observer

1369
01:32:34,700 --> 01:32:37,700
mode and the ability to rebind keys. So that's something, even if you own the

1370
01:32:38,700 --> 01:32:41,700
game, like part of the Starcraft anthology or something like that, you can

1371
01:32:41,700 --> 01:32:44,700
actually download that and be able to update your game as well.

1372
01:32:45,700 --> 01:32:48,700
Yeah, well, Blizzard's been patching like their games like ten years after the

1373
01:32:49,700 --> 01:32:52,700
fact. Diablo 2 got a patch like a couple years ago. So, you know, it happens.

1374
01:32:53,700 --> 01:32:58,700
But you guys have to remember, Starcraft is still huge in many places. And, you

1375
01:32:59,700 --> 01:33:01,700
know, yes, Starcraft 2 is a thing. And yes, there's people that play that

1376
01:33:02,700 --> 01:33:05,700
instead. But the original Starcraft is still like huge. So it's a pretty big

1377
01:33:06,700 --> 01:33:09,700
deal for Blizzard to come out and say basically that we're not going to touch

1378
01:33:09,700 --> 01:33:15,700
anything with balance. This is just like a cosmetic overhaul and that's it.

1379
01:33:16,700 --> 01:33:18,700
Well, I guess there's also some things probably with the matchmaking and the

1380
01:33:19,700 --> 01:33:23,700
fact that it'll actually be integrated with, I keep wanting to say Battle Net,

1381
01:33:24,700 --> 01:33:27,700
but the Blizzard launcher, whatever the hell they're calling it now, Battle Net,

1382
01:33:28,700 --> 01:33:30,700
they're basically integrating it into the same system that used the Overwatch.

1383
01:33:31,700 --> 01:33:36,700
Battle Not. They Battle Not. Diablo 3 and World of Warcraft and all that use

1384
01:33:36,700 --> 01:33:38,700
this. So now you should be able to see your friends as they're playing the

1385
01:33:39,700 --> 01:33:43,700
original Starcraft should all be integrated into that. The HD version

1386
01:33:44,700 --> 01:33:47,700
anyway. But I don't know if you were going to get into this. So sorry if I'm

1387
01:33:48,700 --> 01:33:51,700
ruining something. But I believe I heard they're going to give away the original

1388
01:33:52,700 --> 01:33:55,700
Starcraft as part of this, right? Or like just in like the coming week or

1389
01:33:56,700 --> 01:33:59,700
something, you can actually get the old school Starcraft for free. Not the

1390
01:34:00,700 --> 01:34:02,700
redo. You'll have to pay for that. I don't know how much you're going to charge

1391
01:34:03,700 --> 01:34:05,700
for that. But if you've never gotten into Starcraft, you'll be able to get

1392
01:34:06,700 --> 01:34:08,700
the original in the expansion just for free. They're just going to give it away

1393
01:34:09,700 --> 01:34:13,700
even though they've sold it for 20 bucks. 20 bucks for a game from 1997 until now.

1394
01:34:14,700 --> 01:34:16,700
And now they're finally just going to make it free for everybody. So that part's

1395
01:34:17,700 --> 01:34:22,700
pretty cool. Yeah. Yeah. So, um, I'm, I'm fucking terrible at Starcraft, so I

1396
01:34:23,700 --> 01:34:26,700
don't know if anything's going to make me better. I do own Starcraft 2, but I

1397
01:34:27,700 --> 01:34:30,700
like all the arcade game things you can do in that. I don't, I'm terrible at the

1398
01:34:31,700 --> 01:34:33,700
game itself. When you watch the people that are good at that game, like they

1399
01:34:33,700 --> 01:34:38,700
have all of their key binds down. They're like building stuff like it's so fast.

1400
01:34:39,700 --> 01:34:41,700
Like the way people move in that game. It's just like, I can't, I can't operate

1401
01:34:42,700 --> 01:34:45,700
on that level. I just can't. So, but I think it's cool that they're remastering

1402
01:34:46,700 --> 01:34:51,700
the game. Yeah. Like not trying to reinvent the wheel, but like, Hey, this

1403
01:34:52,700 --> 01:34:57,700
game is still popular. Almost God, 20 years. We are here 20 years after the

1404
01:34:58,700 --> 01:35:01,700
fact, this game is still popular. So we're just gonna give it a new coat of

1405
01:35:01,700 --> 01:35:05,700
paint and that's it. We're not gonna fuck with what makes it still a loved

1406
01:35:06,700 --> 01:35:09,700
game all these years later. So, um, I want to make sure I throw in a story here

1407
01:35:10,700 --> 01:35:13,700
as well, because it's something that, uh, Jason had brought up in the intro to

1408
01:35:14,700 --> 01:35:18,700
the show tonight, uh, is that good old galaxy or GOG, uh, also got an upgrade

1409
01:35:19,700 --> 01:35:23,700
this week. GOG is, uh, up to version 1.2 of GOG galaxy, which is their front

1410
01:35:24,700 --> 01:35:27,700
end. If you haven't used enough GOG, it's kind of like the steam client, if you

1411
01:35:27,700 --> 01:35:31,700
will. God galaxy is their front end, which includes the store as well as the

1412
01:35:32,700 --> 01:35:34,700
games that you bought. Now, obviously God kind of started with a lot of the retro

1413
01:35:35,700 --> 01:35:39,700
stuff, but now they have a lot of more modern stuff, especially in the things, uh,

1414
01:35:40,700 --> 01:35:43,700
in the marketplace as well. Yeah. Um, well, one of the big perks about the new

1415
01:35:44,700 --> 01:35:48,700
version of God galaxy is that now there are universal cloud saves. Note this,

1416
01:35:49,700 --> 01:35:53,700
it doesn't matter which game you're using for any game on GOG. They don't have

1417
01:35:53,700 --> 01:35:57,700
to build an extra support for this. Galaxy 1.2 will let your saves be stored

1418
01:35:58,700 --> 01:36:02,700
and synced online. So my assumption is it must tell these games that you have

1419
01:36:03,700 --> 01:36:05,700
another drive on your computer that is actually located in the clouds. That's,

1420
01:36:06,700 --> 01:36:08,700
I haven't used it yet, but that's my assumption, how something like this must

1421
01:36:09,700 --> 01:36:12,700
work and work in every game is that it's putting a new cloud drive on your

1422
01:36:13,700 --> 01:36:17,700
computer where all this stuff can pretty much be saved. So, uh, and this is cool

1423
01:36:18,700 --> 01:36:21,700
because if you ever upgrade your PC, you won't lose your save files. They're all

1424
01:36:21,700 --> 01:36:24,700
right there. I'm assuming if you go to a friend's house and log in or something,

1425
01:36:25,700 --> 01:36:29,700
your cloud files will be right there. So, you know, GOG has to find ways to

1426
01:36:30,700 --> 01:36:33,700
differentiate itself from steam because steam is still kind of the behemoth there

1427
01:36:34,700 --> 01:36:37,700
and everybody flips the fuck out about steam sales, but not as many people flip

1428
01:36:38,700 --> 01:36:42,700
the fuck out about GOG sales except I appreciate the rage nator will call into

1429
01:36:43,700 --> 01:36:45,700
the show whenever there is a GOG sale, but you know what I mean? Like GOG has

1430
01:36:46,700 --> 01:36:49,700
its proponents, but it's far outnumbered by the number of people that are still

1431
01:36:49,700 --> 01:36:53,700
talking about steam. So, um, you know, GOG has to think of these other ways to

1432
01:36:54,700 --> 01:36:58,700
push themselves forward. Um, something else that galaxy is going to be doing in

1433
01:36:59,700 --> 01:37:03,700
1.2, there's a new in game overlay, so you can hit shift tab just like you can in

1434
01:37:04,700 --> 01:37:07,700
steam and it brings up an overlay so you can have a chat system, notifications,

1435
01:37:08,700 --> 01:37:11,700
achievements, and all that stuff. Also a screenshots now built in when you have

1436
01:37:12,700 --> 01:37:16,700
F12. Um, so that's pretty cool, which, you know, I hate to say it, but that is all

1437
01:37:16,700 --> 01:37:19,700
functionality that does exist within steam, but still good to try to bring, you

1438
01:37:20,700 --> 01:37:23,700
know, a little bit of parody and, and, you know, the other feature they said that

1439
01:37:24,700 --> 01:37:27,700
was a pretty major feature of 1.2 is that they're going to be allowing users to

1440
01:37:28,700 --> 01:37:32,700
that customize what galaxies features are. Um, so they can turn off things that

1441
01:37:33,700 --> 01:37:37,700
they don't want to unbloat the client basically. So they can, you know, um,

1442
01:37:38,700 --> 01:37:41,700
also they have like a hibernate mode that's going to drop CPU usage and

1443
01:37:41,700 --> 01:37:45,700
decrease battery life when you're, you know, getting mobiley or something like

1444
01:37:46,700 --> 01:37:52,700
that. An FPS counter, bandwidth limiter, screenshot capturing, achievement rarity,

1445
01:37:53,700 --> 01:37:59,700
stuff like that. Cool. Um, so, um, yeah, you can, uh, I think you have to be in

1446
01:38:00,700 --> 01:38:03,700
their little preview thing or opt into betas to actually see this now. I don't

1447
01:38:04,700 --> 01:38:06,700
think this rolls out for everybody till April, but I don't think they have a

1448
01:38:07,700 --> 01:38:10,700
closed beta thing like, like Xbox one does or anything. I think you just opt in

1449
01:38:11,700 --> 01:38:14,700
if you want to check it out. Although it might have bugs. So don't blame me if

1450
01:38:15,700 --> 01:38:18,700
there's bugs. All right. Uh, look, you have something else for us. Then maybe

1451
01:38:19,700 --> 01:38:21,700
we'll get to mailbag here soon. Yeah. We can talk about some of the Xbox one

1452
01:38:22,700 --> 01:38:25,700
updates. So Xbox one is going to be adding some tournament features with their

1453
01:38:26,700 --> 01:38:30,700
next update. So they're going to be adding support for ESL back tournaments in a

1454
01:38:31,700 --> 01:38:35,700
thing called arena. Um, I guess the world of tanks is going to be one of the

1455
01:38:36,700 --> 01:38:40,700
first games to support that. And you can join ranked matches and be notified of

1456
01:38:41,700 --> 01:38:46,700
tournament progress and see the results. And they're saying that also that, um,

1457
01:38:47,700 --> 01:38:51,700
along with that, they're going to add some more games to it later on. They're

1458
01:38:52,700 --> 01:38:56,700
also going to be adding the ability to upload custom gamer pics so you can put

1459
01:38:57,700 --> 01:39:00,700
your own gear picks on there now instead of just whatever they're offering you,

1460
01:39:01,700 --> 01:39:05,700
which is kind of nice. And then, um, they're saying though that that's not

1461
01:39:06,700 --> 01:39:09,700
going to be, they're going to be building that from your mobile phone or PC or

1462
01:39:09,700 --> 01:39:13,700
even console. Um, and there, I didn't really see how they're going to police

1463
01:39:14,700 --> 01:39:18,700
that. So if you see Dick pics on there and then, well, it's a work in progress.

1464
01:39:19,700 --> 01:39:24,700
Um, and then of course, uh, with that, they're allowing you to log into a wifi

1465
01:39:25,700 --> 01:39:30,700
network, uh, which needs browser for sign in authenticity. So you can actually,

1466
01:39:31,700 --> 01:39:35,700
you know, it'll pop up your browser within there if you need to do that.

1467
01:39:35,700 --> 01:39:40,700
So like you're at, you know, a school or something. Hmm. Yeah.

1468
01:39:42,700 --> 01:39:46,700
Um, and then of course also they're allowing you to filter your library via

1469
01:39:47,700 --> 01:39:52,700
Xbox 360 or Xbox one. You can pin items and to your activity feed and auto zoom

1470
01:39:53,700 --> 01:39:55,700
using connect when you're using Skype. That's good.

1471
01:39:56,700 --> 01:39:59,700
Cause my library on Xbox one's getting really bloated with all the Xbox 360

1472
01:40:00,700 --> 01:40:01,700
backwards compatibility and the games with gold.

1473
01:40:01,700 --> 01:40:04,700
Like there's a lot to scroll through. So I'm, I'm kind of glad they're,

1474
01:40:05,700 --> 01:40:08,700
they're changing that up a little bit. Yeah. Um, some other cool stuff.

1475
01:40:09,700 --> 01:40:13,700
There's some, some, they announced the games for games of gold for April.

1476
01:40:14,700 --> 01:40:17,700
So you're going to get rise on Xbox one for the whole month of April.

1477
01:40:18,700 --> 01:40:23,700
Um, and then I guess, uh, April 16th through May 15th,

1478
01:40:24,700 --> 01:40:27,700
you're going to get the walking dead season two on Xbox one.

1479
01:40:27,700 --> 01:40:30,700
And then on Xbox 360 for the first half of April,

1480
01:40:31,700 --> 01:40:35,700
Darksiders in the second half, Assassin's Creed revelations.

1481
01:40:36,700 --> 01:40:39,700
Um, cool. Let's see the rises on there. Yeah.

1482
01:40:40,700 --> 01:40:42,700
Rise was one of the launch titles, right? Yeah, it was. Yeah.

1483
01:40:43,700 --> 01:40:46,700
And then finally there is also some more backwards compatibility, um,

1484
01:40:47,700 --> 01:40:51,700
information including yes, including they have added backwards compatibility

1485
01:40:52,700 --> 01:40:54,700
support for Daytona USA.

1486
01:40:57,700 --> 01:41:10,700
I've been waiting to play that song for years. Years.

1487
01:41:11,700 --> 01:41:16,700
Always. We always need an excuse to do that. Um, so yeah, that's pretty awesome.

1488
01:41:17,700 --> 01:41:21,700
And so along with that, you can also, um, I guess stacking and tower blocks

1489
01:41:22,700 --> 01:41:25,700
deluxe was another, um, two titles that were added on there.

1490
01:41:25,700 --> 01:41:28,700
Who fucking cares? Daytona. Exactly. Daytona.

1491
01:41:29,700 --> 01:41:31,700
Sorry to the developers who worked very hard on those games,

1492
01:41:32,700 --> 01:41:35,700
but maybe if you included a really catchy theme songs, right?

1493
01:41:36,700 --> 01:41:38,700
That's right. Then, you know, exactly.

1494
01:41:39,700 --> 01:41:40,700
So you really only have yourselves a blame for that.

1495
01:41:43,700 --> 01:41:44,700
Uh, let's get to the mailbag.

1496
01:41:50,700 --> 01:41:53,700
Every week you guys email us participate at orange long trader.com

1497
01:41:53,700 --> 01:41:56,700
is the place to send your emails and we dive into the mailbag and pick

1498
01:41:57,700 --> 01:42:00,700
some emails to read here on the show. Uh, or in the case of this week,

1499
01:42:01,700 --> 01:42:04,700
we have one loan email to read on the show tonight, but it's a good one.

1500
01:42:05,700 --> 01:42:07,700
So I'm going to jump into that right now since dark soccer is not here.

1501
01:42:08,700 --> 01:42:10,700
I will, um, fulfill as, as the runner up at the pageant,

1502
01:42:11,700 --> 01:42:13,700
I will fulfill her duties, uh, as a queen of the show.

1503
01:42:14,700 --> 01:42:17,700
So, uh, participate at orange launch radio again,

1504
01:42:18,700 --> 01:42:19,700
if you want to send us an email for a future week.

1505
01:42:19,700 --> 01:42:23,700
Uh, but this email tonight comes to us from our pal James Nighthawk,

1506
01:42:24,700 --> 01:42:26,700
who says salutations from across the pond.

1507
01:42:27,700 --> 01:42:28,700
James Nighthawk here writing in from England.

1508
01:42:29,700 --> 01:42:30,700
I've been meaning to mail for a while, but as we know,

1509
01:42:31,700 --> 01:42:32,700
all know life gets in the way.

1510
01:42:33,700 --> 01:42:36,700
I'm writing to hopefully trigger further conversation about the services

1511
01:42:37,700 --> 01:42:39,700
provided on modern gaming consoles with some different perspectives

1512
01:42:40,700 --> 01:42:41,700
to stir into the mix.

1513
01:42:42,700 --> 01:42:44,700
You've recently been discussing the lack of streaming services

1514
01:42:45,700 --> 01:42:46,700
and apps available on launch for the Nintendo switch.

1515
01:42:46,700 --> 01:42:48,700
I agree with, or at least understand your arguments

1516
01:42:49,700 --> 01:42:51,700
for many of the points you have all raised.

1517
01:42:52,700 --> 01:42:53,700
However, I would like to offer some counterpoints.

1518
01:42:54,700 --> 01:42:55,700
Please note when reading this,

1519
01:42:56,700 --> 01:42:57,700
I'm not sure where I stand on this matter yet,

1520
01:42:58,700 --> 01:42:59,700
so this is all good debate from my perspective.

1521
01:43:00,700 --> 01:43:03,700
You mentioned that the landscape has changed since the launch days

1522
01:43:04,700 --> 01:43:05,700
of the 360 PlayStation 3 Wii era.

1523
01:43:06,700 --> 01:43:09,700
Netflix, YouTube, et al are now standard parts of our lives.

1524
01:43:10,700 --> 01:43:12,700
Whereas back in 2006, the consoles were not weaker

1525
01:43:13,700 --> 01:43:14,700
for lacking these services. This is true.

1526
01:43:14,700 --> 01:43:16,700
The addition of Netflix and so forth to these systems

1527
01:43:17,700 --> 01:43:19,700
arguably extended the lifespans of these consoles.

1528
01:43:20,700 --> 01:43:23,700
I for one know many people for whom the Wii was the Netflix machine

1529
01:43:24,700 --> 01:43:26,700
after the charm of Wii Sports started to wane.

1530
01:43:27,700 --> 01:43:30,700
However, I proffer that the landscape has changed further still.

1531
01:43:31,700 --> 01:43:33,700
Many televisions have built-in streaming services.

1532
01:43:34,700 --> 01:43:37,700
The likes of Roku, Amazon, Fire Stick, Apple TV, and so on

1533
01:43:38,700 --> 01:43:40,700
each offer cheap, quick methods for streaming.

1534
01:43:41,700 --> 01:43:42,700
Running a games console for Netflix

1535
01:43:42,700 --> 01:43:45,700
is arguably a needless use of electricity for many people

1536
01:43:46,700 --> 01:43:48,700
when a light device with a convenient remote control

1537
01:43:49,700 --> 01:43:51,700
or a built-in smart TV app does the job better.

1538
01:43:52,700 --> 01:43:55,700
Not to mention the phones, tablets, laptops, and so forth many of us have.

1539
01:43:56,700 --> 01:43:58,700
Let us consider the Kindle. No, not the Kindle Fire,

1540
01:43:59,700 --> 01:44:00,700
the humble Kindle. Kindle, the e-reader.

1541
01:44:01,700 --> 01:44:03,700
The Kindle of today does less than the older Kindles.

1542
01:44:04,700 --> 01:44:06,700
My first Kindle had an experimental browser.

1543
01:44:07,700 --> 01:44:08,700
The experiment, I can only assume,

1544
01:44:09,700 --> 01:44:10,700
was to see how long the average person would use it

1545
01:44:10,700 --> 01:44:13,700
before rolling their eyes, guffawing comically,

1546
01:44:14,700 --> 01:44:16,700
and grabbing any other device to browse the internet.

1547
01:44:17,700 --> 01:44:19,700
It was slow, monochrome, and unresponsive.

1548
01:44:20,700 --> 01:44:22,700
It was a concept, a bad concept, that went no further.

1549
01:44:23,700 --> 01:44:25,700
The Kindle does one thing. It does books, and it does books well.

1550
01:44:26,700 --> 01:44:28,700
When I read on my tablet, notifications tempt me away.

1551
01:44:29,700 --> 01:44:31,700
The ease of access to social media is omnipresent.

1552
01:44:32,700 --> 01:44:33,700
Distractions, distractions, distractions.

1553
01:44:34,700 --> 01:44:37,700
Equally, a tablet hasn't the right kind of screen for reading lengthy texts in bed,

1554
01:44:37,700 --> 01:44:40,700
nor are they light enough to hold in one hand for hours at a time.

1555
01:44:41,700 --> 01:44:43,700
The Kindle does one thing, and it does it well.

1556
01:44:44,700 --> 01:44:45,700
Now, on to Nintendo.

1557
01:44:46,700 --> 01:44:47,700
Like Rob, I've been thoroughly enjoying my Switch.

1558
01:44:48,700 --> 01:44:49,700
I enjoy the light nature of the OS.

1559
01:44:50,700 --> 01:44:51,700
It is snappy and simple, and when I'm using it,

1560
01:44:52,700 --> 01:44:53,700
I'm doing one thing. I'm gaming.

1561
01:44:54,700 --> 01:44:55,700
In an age where every device offers every service,

1562
01:44:56,700 --> 01:44:58,700
having certain devices do one thing well is refreshing.

1563
01:44:59,700 --> 01:45:02,700
Nintendo can't compete on gaming spec with Sony and Microsoft.

1564
01:45:03,700 --> 01:45:05,700
They can't compete on apps with Apple or Android.

1565
01:45:05,700 --> 01:45:08,700
What they do have in their corner are some of the most solid games in existence,

1566
01:45:09,700 --> 01:45:11,700
in a flexible form that is both portable and dockable.

1567
01:45:12,700 --> 01:45:15,700
By providing a simple, malleable gaming system that does nothing else,

1568
01:45:16,700 --> 01:45:17,700
they can be seen as focusing their energies.

1569
01:45:18,700 --> 01:45:20,700
I would like to reiterate, I'm not sure if this argument holds water.

1570
01:45:21,700 --> 01:45:22,700
It will be interesting to see what happens in the coming few years.

1571
01:45:23,700 --> 01:45:24,700
The iPhone killed the iPod.

1572
01:45:25,700 --> 01:45:27,700
But this is because, in terms of sound quality and convenience,

1573
01:45:28,700 --> 01:45:29,700
the iPhone made the iPod largely irrelevant.

1574
01:45:30,700 --> 01:45:32,700
The iPhone does not make console gaming irrelevant,

1575
01:45:33,700 --> 01:45:34,700
as touch gaming is no substitute for real controls.

1576
01:45:35,700 --> 01:45:38,700
Equally, the Xbox One and PlayStation 4 do not make the Switch irrelevant,

1577
01:45:39,700 --> 01:45:41,700
as they are not as flexible, nor do they have the Nintendo games.

1578
01:45:42,700 --> 01:45:43,700
Nintendo may be on to something here.

1579
01:45:44,700 --> 01:45:48,700
Choice is, yes, this is a long email, but it's good, so I'm going to read it all.

1580
01:45:49,700 --> 01:45:50,700
Choice is, of course, paramount.

1581
01:45:51,700 --> 01:45:52,700
Nintendo can offer Netflix, YouTube, and so on,

1582
01:45:53,700 --> 01:45:54,700
and I can choose not to use them.

1583
01:45:55,700 --> 01:45:57,700
But I do wonder how vital such apps are to the sales of the system.

1584
01:45:58,700 --> 01:46:01,700
Most Switch owners are likely swimming in app-laden devices already.

1585
01:46:01,700 --> 01:46:04,700
They purchase, or want to purchase, a Switch to play Nintendo games.

1586
01:46:05,700 --> 01:46:09,700
Indeed, for the last five years, Nintendo has arguably scared off potential customers.

1587
01:46:10,700 --> 01:46:12,700
Hear ye, hear ye, come play Nintendo's awesome games, they cry.

1588
01:46:13,700 --> 01:46:15,700
Buy a Wii U for our awesome games, they exclaim.

1589
01:46:16,700 --> 01:46:19,700
Oh, and a 3DS2 for other awesome games, they siren, louder still,

1590
01:46:20,700 --> 01:46:23,700
now with beads of sweat congealing on their collective brows.

1591
01:46:24,700 --> 01:46:26,700
In the end, many people chose to buy neither system,

1592
01:46:27,700 --> 01:46:29,700
baffled by the choice of hardware and the division of games.

1593
01:46:29,700 --> 01:46:32,700
The Switch is Nintendo's chance to rally Nintendo games

1594
01:46:33,700 --> 01:46:35,700
and Nintendo fans behind one system, a gaming system.

1595
01:46:36,700 --> 01:46:40,700
The rest is the cream on the, hopefully very tempting, piece of gadget pudding.

1596
01:46:41,700 --> 01:46:43,700
Thanks for reading, and I hope my English vernacular hasn't befuddled you

1597
01:46:44,700 --> 01:46:45,700
or your listeners too much.

1598
01:46:46,700 --> 01:46:47,700
P.S. Jamie, you might like this.

1599
01:46:48,700 --> 01:46:50,700
Well, she's not here tonight, but we'll try to enjoy it on her behalf.

1600
01:46:51,700 --> 01:46:52,700
Regarding your use of the word hysterical

1601
01:46:53,700 --> 01:46:55,700
when describing the internet dickheads threatening the EA worker last week,

1602
01:46:55,700 --> 01:46:59,700
the word hysterical is derived from the Latin hysteria, meaning womb.

1603
01:47:00,700 --> 01:47:04,700
Hysteria was originally defined as a neurotic condition peculiar to women

1604
01:47:05,700 --> 01:47:07,700
and thought to be caused by a dysfunction of the uterus.

1605
01:47:08,700 --> 01:47:10,700
A rather delicious linguistic irony there.

1606
01:47:11,700 --> 01:47:12,700
I am a fan of irony.

1607
01:47:13,700 --> 01:47:15,700
A good day to all, and to Jamie, resist.

1608
01:47:16,700 --> 01:47:17,700
James Nighthawk.

1609
01:47:18,700 --> 01:47:19,700
Wonderful email, thank you for sharing.

1610
01:47:20,700 --> 01:47:21,700
I'm sure Jamie would give you a gold star if she was here,

1611
01:47:22,700 --> 01:47:23,700
so I will give you a gold star in her steed.

1612
01:47:23,700 --> 01:47:25,700
I think you do bring up good points in your email,

1613
01:47:26,700 --> 01:47:28,700
but here's the one problem for me,

1614
01:47:29,700 --> 01:47:31,700
and I think the one thing that you overlooked in your examples

1615
01:47:32,700 --> 01:47:33,700
and the thing that I keep coming back to as to

1616
01:47:34,700 --> 01:47:35,700
why am I holding Nintendo to a different standard

1617
01:47:36,700 --> 01:47:37,700
with this whole Netflix thing.

1618
01:47:38,700 --> 01:47:39,700
Yes, your TVs can do it.

1619
01:47:40,700 --> 01:47:41,700
Yes, your phones can do it.

1620
01:47:42,700 --> 01:47:45,700
But what your TV can't do is come off of the television

1621
01:47:46,700 --> 01:47:48,700
and go into your pocket out the front door.

1622
01:47:49,700 --> 01:47:50,700
And that's something the Switch does.

1623
01:47:50,700 --> 01:47:55,700
And Nintendo has been selling the Switch for doing this for games,

1624
01:47:56,700 --> 01:48:00,700
which is cool, but not all the, for lack of a better term,

1625
01:48:01,700 --> 01:48:02,700
excuse me for this example,

1626
01:48:03,700 --> 01:48:04,700
not all of the soccer moms out there,

1627
01:48:05,700 --> 01:48:07,700
oh, excuse me, excuse me, football moms.

1628
01:48:08,700 --> 01:48:09,700
Gotta forget I'm speaking to somebody on the other side of the pond.

1629
01:48:10,700 --> 01:48:13,700
But all joking aside, we call them soccer moms here in the US.

1630
01:48:14,700 --> 01:48:16,700
So all the soccer moms out there probably aren't gonna get it

1631
01:48:17,700 --> 01:48:19,700
when it comes to games, but show them the moms.

1632
01:48:20,700 --> 01:48:22,700
Show them the movie, the Netflix on the TV that,

1633
01:48:23,700 --> 01:48:26,700
oh, gotta go sit in the doctor's office for this appointment.

1634
01:48:27,700 --> 01:48:30,700
Obviously you don't want to encourage people to watch TV when they drive.

1635
01:48:31,700 --> 01:48:33,700
So they're gonna have to kind of dance around that issue and that whole thing.

1636
01:48:34,700 --> 01:48:35,700
But, you know, they could, even with the kids,

1637
01:48:36,700 --> 01:48:37,700
the kids are watching a TV show and, oh,

1638
01:48:38,700 --> 01:48:39,700
we gotta get going to grandma's or whatever.

1639
01:48:40,700 --> 01:48:42,700
You can pick that show up right off the TV

1640
01:48:43,700 --> 01:48:44,700
and take it with you right on out to the car.

1641
01:48:45,700 --> 01:48:48,700
Now, although you may think right now with Netflix

1642
01:48:48,700 --> 01:48:52,700
that's not possible because Netflix requires an always stable internet connection,

1643
01:48:53,700 --> 01:48:57,700
remember a few months ago Netflix introduced the whole downloading things.

1644
01:48:58,700 --> 01:49:00,700
So there's no reason why you couldn't queue something up on the Switch

1645
01:49:01,700 --> 01:49:03,700
and as you watch it, the rest of the episode downloads.

1646
01:49:04,700 --> 01:49:05,700
So at a certain point while you're watching it,

1647
01:49:06,700 --> 01:49:09,700
now that thing is saved on your device, that movie or whatever you're watching.

1648
01:49:10,700 --> 01:49:12,700
I realize Netflix's onboard storage could be a challenge with this,

1649
01:49:13,700 --> 01:49:17,700
but I downloaded a movie to watch on a plane

1650
01:49:18,700 --> 01:49:20,700
and it's only like 600 megabytes or something because, you know,

1651
01:49:21,700 --> 01:49:23,700
it's only in like 720p, you know, or whatever.

1652
01:49:24,700 --> 01:49:26,700
It's not, you know, the highest definition picture

1653
01:49:27,700 --> 01:49:29,700
because those tablets aren't the highest definition things.

1654
01:49:30,700 --> 01:49:34,700
But anyway, I think maybe that's my point with all this is that,

1655
01:49:35,700 --> 01:49:37,700
okay, it's one thing to show the games up and on the go,

1656
01:49:38,700 --> 01:49:41,700
but you could bring in even more people to buy this device for their families

1657
01:49:42,700 --> 01:49:44,700
if you could show it with the TV as well.

1658
01:49:45,700 --> 01:49:46,700
And that's kind of been my point.

1659
01:49:46,700 --> 01:49:48,700
Like otherwise, sure, I agree with you.

1660
01:49:49,700 --> 01:49:51,700
You don't need Netflix on every single device.

1661
01:49:52,700 --> 01:49:54,700
The thing is the Switch does it differently

1662
01:49:55,700 --> 01:49:57,700
and even Nintendo is trying to sell that in their argument.

1663
01:49:58,700 --> 01:49:59,700
The Switch does gaming differently.

1664
01:50:00,700 --> 01:50:02,700
Now you can pick it up and take it with you on the go wherever you want.

1665
01:50:03,700 --> 01:50:06,700
So I just find it a missed opportunity, if you will,

1666
01:50:07,700 --> 01:50:09,700
that they're not doing this with Netflix, Hulu,

1667
01:50:10,700 --> 01:50:12,700
whatever movie technology would allow them to download on the go

1668
01:50:13,700 --> 01:50:14,700
and all this and do it.

1669
01:50:14,700 --> 01:50:16,700
Will they build in that technology by holiday?

1670
01:50:17,700 --> 01:50:18,700
They might. That could be something that could happen.

1671
01:50:19,700 --> 01:50:20,700
So I don't think this is a, you know,

1672
01:50:21,700 --> 01:50:22,700
certainly not something they can't just, you know,

1673
01:50:23,700 --> 01:50:24,700
backdoor into the system at some point or what have you.

1674
01:50:25,700 --> 01:50:26,700
Is this something that's going to wreck the system

1675
01:50:27,700 --> 01:50:28,700
if they never introduce it?

1676
01:50:29,700 --> 01:50:31,700
Clearly not. The system's doing pretty well as it is right now.

1677
01:50:32,700 --> 01:50:35,700
It definitely looks like it's going to have a more favorable outcome than Wii U

1678
01:50:36,700 --> 01:50:39,700
and if Nintendo gets what they want, it might even end up better than the Wii.

1679
01:50:39,700 --> 01:50:45,700
But I just think those types of apps can really kind of push it beyond just gamers.

1680
01:50:46,700 --> 01:50:49,700
You know, and I know, I know, I know you guys are probably rolling your eyes

1681
01:50:50,700 --> 01:50:51,700
because you're like, wait a minute, Rob.

1682
01:50:52,700 --> 01:50:57,700
You can't sit there and go, well, Microsoft talks about TVs and movies

1683
01:50:58,700 --> 01:51:01,700
and all this shit too much, but yet Nintendo doesn't talk about it enough.

1684
01:51:02,700 --> 01:51:04,700
Yeah, but the difference is the technology.

1685
01:51:05,700 --> 01:51:06,700
It's like James said in the email.

1686
01:51:06,700 --> 01:51:11,700
The Xbox and what it was doing was reductive to what your television can already do.

1687
01:51:12,700 --> 01:51:14,700
The Switch offers this new thing.

1688
01:51:15,700 --> 01:51:16,700
You can pick it up and take it on the go.

1689
01:51:17,700 --> 01:51:18,700
You can't do that with your TV.

1690
01:51:19,700 --> 01:51:20,700
The only thing I can think of where maybe you could do that

1691
01:51:21,700 --> 01:51:23,700
is if you had an Apple TV and an iPhone.

1692
01:51:24,700 --> 01:51:27,700
I suppose that may exist, but that is two separate pieces of hardware,

1693
01:51:28,700 --> 01:51:29,700
not one piece of hardware like the Switch is.

1694
01:51:30,700 --> 01:51:33,700
So that's all. I just, I see it as a missed opportunity.

1695
01:51:33,700 --> 01:51:37,700
But I think it's one Nintendo will probably inject into the system sooner rather than later.

1696
01:51:38,700 --> 01:51:39,700
I don't know. Any, any thoughts, Loki?

1697
01:51:40,700 --> 01:51:42,700
It's just added value. And even it would be nice just to take, like,

1698
01:51:43,700 --> 01:51:47,700
not necessarily even Netflix movies, but it'd be nice if it would just do any sort of media playback,

1699
01:51:48,700 --> 01:51:50,700
you know, throw some movies onto, because obviously, you know,

1700
01:51:51,700 --> 01:51:53,700
you're not gonna always have Wi-Fi with the Switch and stuff.

1701
01:51:54,700 --> 01:51:56,700
So say you're going on a plane or something like that

1702
01:51:57,700 --> 01:51:58,700
and you want to watch some movies on a flight instead of having, like,

1703
01:51:59,700 --> 01:52:01,700
to buy a tablet or have your phone or something to do that.

1704
01:52:01,700 --> 01:52:06,700
You throw some movies onto, you know, the SD card and away you go.

1705
01:52:07,700 --> 01:52:08,700
That'd be just nice.

1706
01:52:09,700 --> 01:52:12,700
I'm reading some comments in chat over at live.vog network.com.

1707
01:52:13,700 --> 01:52:14,700
Do I even know our own website?

1708
01:52:15,700 --> 01:52:16,700
William Ritterface in chat says,

1709
01:52:17,700 --> 01:52:19,700
Sky, you could conceivably do that with a laptop or a netbook.

1710
01:52:20,700 --> 01:52:24,700
Okay, but, like, seriously, I realize the demographic listening to this show

1711
01:52:25,700 --> 01:52:26,700
is not the every demographic out there,

1712
01:52:27,700 --> 01:52:28,700
but how many people have their laptops hooked up to their TV?

1713
01:52:29,700 --> 01:52:30,700
Not a lot.

1714
01:52:31,700 --> 01:52:32,700
I mean, soccer moms of America.

1715
01:52:33,700 --> 01:52:35,700
Do they all have their laptops hooked up to their TV and all this stuff?

1716
01:52:36,700 --> 01:52:37,700
I don't think they do.

1717
01:52:38,700 --> 01:52:39,700
Or how about kids?

1718
01:52:40,700 --> 01:52:41,700
Laptops are kind of bulky, you know what I mean?

1719
01:52:42,700 --> 01:52:44,700
Again, it's part of that magic of the Switch system.

1720
01:52:45,700 --> 01:52:46,700
It just fucking works.

1721
01:52:47,700 --> 01:52:49,700
If I didn't have a Wii U, let's just, like, switch it for the Switch,

1722
01:52:50,700 --> 01:52:52,700
because really that's what my son uses the Wii U for,

1723
01:52:53,700 --> 01:52:55,700
is he plays games on it and he'll watch YouTube on it.

1724
01:52:56,700 --> 01:53:00,700
So, like, you know, if we didn't have the Wii U

1725
01:53:01,700 --> 01:53:04,700
and he had the Switch instead, he could watch, you know, YouTube on that,

1726
01:53:05,700 --> 01:53:07,700
or, like, you know, play games on that as well, like a tablet.

1727
01:53:08,700 --> 01:53:10,700
I mean, he has a tablet now, too, but he didn't always have one.

1728
01:53:11,700 --> 01:53:12,700
And even still, even though he does have a tablet,

1729
01:53:13,700 --> 01:53:15,700
he still prefers to play some games on there.

1730
01:53:16,700 --> 01:53:17,700
Like, he'll want to play Minecraft on there.

1731
01:53:18,700 --> 01:53:19,700
He has Minecraft on the tablet, too.

1732
01:53:20,700 --> 01:53:21,700
But he plays Minecraft on the Wii U, because it has the controls,

1733
01:53:22,700 --> 01:53:23,700
and it's easier for him.

1734
01:53:24,700 --> 01:53:25,700
Akdeft in chat says,

1735
01:53:26,700 --> 01:53:28,700
Just wait for the holiday season. Netflix will be on the system by then.

1736
01:53:28,700 --> 01:53:31,700
I do think at the end of the day you're probably right with that.

1737
01:53:32,700 --> 01:53:34,700
Elliot B. in chat over at live.fognetwork.com says,

1738
01:53:35,700 --> 01:53:37,700
How many consoles have launched with media stuff and dropped it later?

1739
01:53:38,700 --> 01:53:40,700
3DS, Xbox One, Vita, question mark.

1740
01:53:41,700 --> 01:53:44,700
Has the media stuff been dropped totally from any of those?

1741
01:53:45,700 --> 01:53:48,700
I don't think Xbox One for sure. They have tons of media stuff on there.

1742
01:53:49,700 --> 01:53:51,700
Yeah, Xbox One is still pushing that, and so does PlayStation 4.

1743
01:53:52,700 --> 01:53:54,700
I mean, I still use a lot of Twitch on PlayStation 4,

1744
01:53:55,700 --> 01:53:56,700
and I do use Netflix on PlayStation 4.

1745
01:53:56,700 --> 01:53:58,700
I use 3DS because it's underpowered.

1746
01:53:59,700 --> 01:54:02,700
I'm pretty sure 3DS still has Netflix, though.

1747
01:54:03,700 --> 01:54:04,700
See, but here's the thing with the Vita.

1748
01:54:05,700 --> 01:54:07,700
Sony dumped the Vita, at least in America.

1749
01:54:08,700 --> 01:54:09,700
In Japan, different story.

1750
01:54:10,700 --> 01:54:12,700
And maybe this is the other element of all that,

1751
01:54:13,700 --> 01:54:14,700
and I honestly don't know the answer to this,

1752
01:54:15,700 --> 01:54:19,700
is how big is Netflix and all that stuff in Japan?

1753
01:54:20,700 --> 01:54:22,700
And maybe that's something I need to consider,

1754
01:54:23,700 --> 01:54:25,700
because Nintendo is going to make decisions,

1755
01:54:26,700 --> 01:54:28,700
not just based on what happens here in the U.S.,

1756
01:54:29,700 --> 01:54:30,700
but what happens in Japan.

1757
01:54:31,700 --> 01:54:33,700
Would there be a need for that, to have this type of Netflix type thing

1758
01:54:34,700 --> 01:54:35,700
where you pick up and move in Japan,

1759
01:54:36,700 --> 01:54:40,700
where transit is much more popular and all that stuff?

1760
01:54:41,700 --> 01:54:42,700
Kaijuto in chat says,

1761
01:54:43,700 --> 01:54:45,700
Vita has Netflix, just hasn't updated it.

1762
01:54:46,700 --> 01:54:47,700
Elliot B says,

1763
01:54:48,700 --> 01:54:49,700
Xbox One abandoned a lot of the TV stuff, right?

1764
01:54:50,700 --> 01:54:54,700
I think that stuff where you direct plug in your cable into the back

1765
01:54:54,700 --> 01:54:57,700
and your Xbox One was basically functioning as your cable box,

1766
01:54:58,700 --> 01:55:00,700
I don't think that functionality is gone, per se,

1767
01:55:01,700 --> 01:55:02,700
but I think it's just kind of flat-lined,

1768
01:55:03,700 --> 01:55:04,700
like it's not really getting updated anymore.

1769
01:55:05,700 --> 01:55:08,700
Like, the Wii U's TV thing, that got shut the fuck down.

1770
01:55:09,700 --> 01:55:10,700
That's gone.

1771
01:55:11,700 --> 01:55:12,700
That's something that got eliminated,

1772
01:55:13,700 --> 01:55:14,700
but I don't think the Xbox One got rid of any of that.

1773
01:55:15,700 --> 01:55:17,700
And certainly in the Netflix-style applications,

1774
01:55:18,700 --> 01:55:19,700
your voodoos, your crackles,

1775
01:55:20,700 --> 01:55:22,700
all the stuff that, when we say Netflix,

1776
01:55:22,700 --> 01:55:24,700
we mean all this other stuff too,

1777
01:55:25,700 --> 01:55:27,700
I think Xbox still has a lot of that stuff.

1778
01:55:28,700 --> 01:55:33,700
But again, I think a lot of it is in low maintenance territory.

1779
01:55:34,700 --> 01:55:38,700
Even Twitch, they just introduced communities on Twitch

1780
01:55:39,700 --> 01:55:40,700
and all that stuff, right?

1781
01:55:41,700 --> 01:55:42,700
I think the mobile versions of Twitch have that now,

1782
01:55:43,700 --> 01:55:45,700
but I'm not sure the PlayStation 4 ones do.

1783
01:55:46,700 --> 01:55:47,700
And I haven't used the Xbox Twitch in a little while,

1784
01:55:48,700 --> 01:55:50,700
if they have that whole element in them now.

1785
01:55:50,700 --> 01:55:53,700
But anyway.

1786
01:55:54,700 --> 01:55:55,700
Alright.

1787
01:55:56,700 --> 01:55:57,700
Thanks for the email.

1788
01:55:58,700 --> 01:55:59,700
It was still a good discussion.

1789
01:56:00,700 --> 01:56:01,700
I still appreciate the perspective and so forth,

1790
01:56:02,700 --> 01:56:03,700
and I realize there are a lot of you

1791
01:56:04,700 --> 01:56:05,700
that are very happy that they're focusing on the games.

1792
01:56:06,700 --> 01:56:07,700
Don't get me wrong, I am too.

1793
01:56:08,700 --> 01:56:09,700
I just see it as a missed opportunity

1794
01:56:10,700 --> 01:56:13,700
if they really want to get those Wii-like numbers

1795
01:56:14,700 --> 01:56:17,700
that are in the stratosphere of selling with a game console.

1796
01:56:18,700 --> 01:56:19,700
But we'll see.

1797
01:56:20,700 --> 01:56:21,700
I kind of think it's just going to end up there by holiday.

1798
01:56:22,700 --> 01:56:25,700
I think the Switch today versus the Switch in December

1799
01:56:26,700 --> 01:56:27,700
is going to look very, very, very different,

1800
01:56:28,700 --> 01:56:29,700
which is why we did the whole time capsule joke a few episodes ago,

1801
01:56:30,700 --> 01:56:33,700
to see what that's going to look like in December.

1802
01:56:34,700 --> 01:56:35,700
Alright, if you want to email us for our future episode,

1803
01:56:36,700 --> 01:56:39,700
participate at orangeloungeradio.com.

1804
01:56:40,700 --> 01:56:42,700
In the meantime, I'm thinking Loki might have a couple more stories for us.

1805
01:56:43,700 --> 01:56:44,700
Yeah, well, we can also probably do release dates.

1806
01:56:45,700 --> 01:56:46,700
Oh, yeah, that whole thing.

1807
01:56:47,700 --> 01:56:48,700
I guess I should probably try to find the Japanese release dates.

1808
01:56:48,700 --> 01:56:50,700
Okay, why don't you talk about what's happening in the US while I...

1809
01:56:51,700 --> 01:56:54,700
Sure. So, this week we actually do have quite a few things coming out.

1810
01:56:55,700 --> 01:56:57,700
So, starting off, Has-Been Heroes is coming out on PC,

1811
01:56:58,700 --> 01:57:01,700
the Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

1812
01:57:02,700 --> 01:57:04,700
Also, we have Kingdom Hearts HD 1.5 Remix

1813
01:57:05,700 --> 01:57:10,700
and Kingdom Hearts HD 2.5 Remix coming out on PlayStation 4.

1814
01:57:11,700 --> 01:57:14,700
MLB The Show 17 on PlayStation 4.

1815
01:57:14,700 --> 01:57:18,700
A game called Old Time Hockey on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

1816
01:57:19,700 --> 01:57:22,700
Parappa the Rapper Remastered on PlayStation 4.

1817
01:57:23,700 --> 01:57:29,700
Walking Dead Season 3 Episode 3 on pretty much all the different formats that that's on.

1818
01:57:30,700 --> 01:57:33,700
PC, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and mobile.

1819
01:57:34,700 --> 01:57:39,700
Attack on Titan Escape from Certain Death on the 3DS.

1820
01:57:40,700 --> 01:57:42,700
Blue Reflection on PlayStation 4 and Vita.

1821
01:57:42,700 --> 01:57:45,700
The Alliance Alive on 3DS.

1822
01:57:46,700 --> 01:57:48,700
This one's actually pretty awesome. I'm looking forward to playing this.

1823
01:57:49,700 --> 01:57:54,700
Thimbleweed Park. Remember that was the game that was the old LucasArts style point-and-click game.

1824
01:57:55,700 --> 01:57:59,700
It's actually done by... What's his name? I can't remember now.

1825
01:58:00,700 --> 01:58:03,700
The guy that did the original Maniac Mansion games and stuff like that.

1826
01:58:04,700 --> 01:58:06,700
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. I know what you're talking about.

1827
01:58:07,700 --> 01:58:09,700
Ron Gilbert? Yeah, Ron Gilbert. Okay.

1828
01:58:10,700 --> 01:58:14,700
And, let's see, Musostars on PlayStation 4 and Vita.

1829
01:58:15,700 --> 01:58:19,700
Oh, and in case I didn't mention, Thimbleweed Park. That's Xbox One and PC, Mac, and Linux.

1830
01:58:20,700 --> 01:58:27,700
And finally, Overload on PC, Mac, Linux, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

1831
01:58:28,700 --> 01:58:31,700
I want to say there was one other one on here. I didn't see it.

1832
01:58:32,700 --> 01:58:35,700
But I know I had it on the other list here.

1833
01:58:35,700 --> 01:58:41,700
I'm not positive because I don't see it on this list, but I want to say Strafe, I think, was coming out this week as well.

1834
01:58:42,700 --> 01:58:48,700
And that's kind of like a Quake, Duke Nukem style first-person shooter game.

1835
01:58:49,700 --> 01:58:51,700
So it's like that retro 90s stuff that's on PC.

1836
01:58:52,700 --> 01:58:54,700
That was a busy week. You know what else is this week?

1837
01:58:55,700 --> 01:58:59,700
There's a patch in Final Fantasy XIV, which, you know, for me, because I'm into that game, so that's a big deal.

1838
01:58:59,700 --> 01:59:05,700
But also, Final Fantasy XV, the Gladio DLC, is this week, as is the Chapter XIII redo.

1839
01:59:06,700 --> 01:59:07,700
So I guess I'll have to go back and play XV then.

1840
01:59:08,700 --> 01:59:12,700
Yeah, so it's a pretty big week. I mean, Square's dumping a lot on us with the Kingdom Hearts thing, too.

1841
01:59:13,700 --> 01:59:18,700
This is actually the week I've been waiting for for a couple years now.

1842
01:59:19,700 --> 01:59:22,700
Because, you know, I didn't buy the Kingdom Hearts 2.5 thing when it came out.

1843
01:59:23,700 --> 01:59:26,700
Because I said, they're going to put this on PlayStation 4 eventually, just like they did Final Fantasy X.

1844
01:59:26,700 --> 01:59:27,700
Of course.

1845
01:59:28,700 --> 01:59:32,700
So here we are. It's finally coming out, so I'm finally going to pick it up and might as well get the one.

1846
01:59:33,700 --> 01:59:39,700
Even though I did buy the Final Fantasy I, because that was a few years ago, I bought the 1.5 or whatever on the PlayStation 3.

1847
01:59:40,700 --> 01:59:41,700
It'll be nice to have that all on the PlayStation 4.

1848
01:59:42,700 --> 01:59:49,700
Because, you know, I'll have time to jump into another, what, probably 300 hours worth of RPGs in between the Mass Effect and Dromedan.

1849
01:59:50,700 --> 01:59:51,700
I'm trying to still beat, so yeah.

1850
01:59:52,700 --> 01:59:55,700
Anyway, let's travel to Japan and check out what's coming out over there.

1851
01:59:56,700 --> 02:00:05,700
In Japan this week, on March 28th, oh no, excuse me, I've got to push out to March 30th to get to Chaos, Child, Love, Chuchu on the PlayStation 4.

1852
02:00:06,700 --> 02:00:09,700
Musou Stars, also out there as well this week.

1853
02:00:10,700 --> 02:00:18,700
Also in Japan, Re Zero, Kada, Hajime-ru, Isekai, Sekkatsu, Death of Kiss in regular and limited edition.

1854
02:00:19,700 --> 02:00:22,700
And Darius Burst, Chronicle Saviors, also out in Japan this week.

1855
02:00:22,700 --> 02:00:29,700
Lastly, Blue Reflection, Maboroshi, Ni-mao, Shouju no Ken, also out in Japan this week.

1856
02:00:30,700 --> 02:00:33,700
And then on the Vita this week, that Musou Star is also being released on the Vita.

1857
02:00:34,700 --> 02:00:39,700
Zero, Kada, Hajime-ru, Isekai, Sekkatsu, Death of Kiss, also on the Vita.

1858
02:00:40,700 --> 02:00:48,700
As is Tokyo Xanadu, Blue Reflection, Maboroshi, Ni-mao, Shoujo no Ken, and Chaos, Child, Love, Chuchu.

1859
02:00:48,700 --> 02:00:52,700
So a lot of those same games on PlayStation 4 are also on the Vita over in Japan.

1860
02:00:53,700 --> 02:00:58,700
Lastly, checking the Switch, I don't think there's anything out on the Switch.

1861
02:00:59,700 --> 02:01:02,700
It looks like there's one game, there's Sango Kushi 13 with a power-up kit.

1862
02:01:03,700 --> 02:01:05,700
And I think this is another one of those, like, Romance of the Three Kingdoms types of games.

1863
02:01:06,700 --> 02:01:08,700
That's out on the Switch this week over in Japan.

1864
02:01:09,700 --> 02:01:10,700
So, there you go.

1865
02:01:12,700 --> 02:01:14,700
The UK, do you happen to have those handy?

1866
02:01:15,700 --> 02:01:16,700
Yes I do.

1867
02:01:16,700 --> 02:01:18,700
Oh my gosh, saves the day. What's up going on in the UK?

1868
02:01:19,700 --> 02:01:22,700
So in the UK we've got Strafe coming out on PC and Mac.

1869
02:01:23,700 --> 02:01:27,700
We've got Snake Pass on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.

1870
02:01:28,700 --> 02:01:36,700
And last but not least, Atari Flashback Classic Volume 1 and Classic Volume 2 on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

1871
02:01:37,700 --> 02:01:38,700
Those have been out here for a little bit.

1872
02:01:39,700 --> 02:01:43,700
It's like just getting a flashback console in game form, so whatever.

1873
02:01:43,700 --> 02:01:46,700
Yeah, so, that's it.

1874
02:01:47,700 --> 02:01:50,700
Alright, let's see, you got some more news for us to talk about?

1875
02:01:51,700 --> 02:01:55,700
Sure, let's talk about Castlevania Symphony Night, it's turned 20.

1876
02:01:56,700 --> 02:01:57,700
Oh my god.

1877
02:01:58,700 --> 02:01:59,700
It's been a long time.

1878
02:02:00,700 --> 02:02:01,700
Congratulations, everybody's old.

1879
02:02:02,700 --> 02:02:03,700
Exactly.

1880
02:02:04,700 --> 02:02:10,700
Let's see, so this is a little bit of drama, but there's that game, Yooka-Laylee, that's coming out.

1881
02:02:10,700 --> 02:02:20,700
And apparently a YouTuber by the name of JonTron, or Jon Jafari, who you may have recognized from social media recently because he said some choice things.

1882
02:02:21,700 --> 02:02:26,700
He has been dropped from the game because of his comments.

1883
02:02:27,700 --> 02:02:36,700
Playtronic basically made the comment, JonTron is a talented video presenter who we were initially two years ago happy to include as a voice contributor in our game.

1884
02:02:36,700 --> 02:02:47,700
However, in light of the recent personal viewpoints, or his personal viewpoints, we have made the decision to remove JonTron's inclusion from the game via a forthcoming content update.

1885
02:02:48,700 --> 02:03:00,700
We would like to make it absolutely clear that we do not endorse or support JonTron's personal viewpoints, and that as an external fan contributor, he does not represent Playtronic in any capacity.

1886
02:03:01,700 --> 02:03:03,700
So, drama be drama.

1887
02:03:04,700 --> 02:03:05,700
Whelp.

1888
02:03:06,700 --> 02:03:09,700
Freedom of speech does not mean freedom from consequence, that's all it is.

1889
02:03:10,700 --> 02:03:11,700
This is very true.

1890
02:03:12,700 --> 02:03:13,700
That's what it boils down to.

1891
02:03:14,700 --> 02:03:16,700
And I got nothing else to say about that.

1892
02:03:17,700 --> 02:03:19,700
What's up next?

1893
02:03:20,700 --> 02:03:22,700
How do we follow that?

1894
02:03:23,700 --> 02:03:26,700
Let's see, what should we talk about next?

1895
02:03:27,700 --> 02:03:33,700
I should have had the little bleep bleep, that's all folks queued up, because that seems the only thing that's appropriate for that moment.

1896
02:03:34,700 --> 02:03:37,700
Let's just follow that with some awkward silence.

1897
02:03:38,700 --> 02:03:44,700
Since we just talked about the anniversary of Symphony Night, I think it's only fair that we talk a little bit about Bloodstained.

1898
02:03:45,700 --> 02:03:50,700
So Bloodstained, I'm sure it's going to come as a shock, it's officially not coming out for the Wii U.

1899
02:03:51,700 --> 02:03:52,700
Oh my god!

1900
02:03:53,700 --> 02:03:54,700
So basically they said, you know...

1901
02:03:54,700 --> 02:03:56,700
I feel like we've reported this three times now.

1902
02:03:57,700 --> 02:04:01,700
I think we just assumed that it wasn't coming out for the Wii U, but now it's not officially coming out.

1903
02:04:02,700 --> 02:04:09,700
So, you know, thank you for supporting us, and the people that backed the Wii U version during the campaign.

1904
02:04:10,700 --> 02:04:13,700
The Wii U was the height of popularity, and because of...

1905
02:04:14,700 --> 02:04:16,700
Okay, maybe that's a little stretch, but whatever.

1906
02:04:17,700 --> 02:04:18,700
Those are some very nice things to say.

1907
02:04:19,700 --> 02:04:21,700
It was at the height of its popularity.

1908
02:04:21,700 --> 02:04:22,700
Okay, okay.

1909
02:04:23,700 --> 02:04:24,700
That's fair.

1910
02:04:25,700 --> 02:04:29,700
But the situation has drastically changed after the release of the Nintendo Switch.

1911
02:04:30,700 --> 02:04:35,700
This change has made it difficult to receive the necessary support from the hardware maker, which has led us to drop the Wii U development.

1912
02:04:36,700 --> 02:04:38,700
And shift the development to the Nintendo Switch.

1913
02:04:39,700 --> 02:04:41,700
Well that sucks if it's Nintendo's fault that they're not able to do that, but...

1914
02:04:42,700 --> 02:04:47,700
Okay, wait, I gotta hear more about this comment over on chat over at live.vognumber.com.

1915
02:04:48,700 --> 02:04:51,700
Stoppy in chat says Kickstarter scans and underdelivers once again.

1916
02:04:52,700 --> 02:04:53,700
I...

1917
02:04:54,700 --> 02:04:55,700
So is this...

1918
02:04:56,700 --> 02:04:58,700
Are you mad it's not coming to Wii U because you don't have a Switch yet?

1919
02:04:59,700 --> 02:05:01,700
I mean, I guess that's the one section of people I could see that are pissed.

1920
02:05:02,700 --> 02:05:05,700
Is that you own a Wii U but you don't own a Switch because you don't have the money for a Switch yet.

1921
02:05:06,700 --> 02:05:07,700
So you were kinda hoping to get this game on Wii U.

1922
02:05:07,700 --> 02:05:16,700
For the most... I imagine most people that are Nintendo fans have already moved on to the Switch or will be planning to by the time this game comes out.

1923
02:05:17,700 --> 02:05:18,700
Because it's still a next year game, right?

1924
02:05:19,700 --> 02:05:20,700
Still 2018.

1925
02:05:21,700 --> 02:05:23,700
So there's still plenty of time to get on board with the Switch or what have you.

1926
02:05:24,700 --> 02:05:25,700
So I'm assuming...

1927
02:05:27,700 --> 02:05:29,700
I'm assuming, yeah, most Nintendo people are gonna make that Switch.

1928
02:05:30,700 --> 02:05:34,700
However, I also know money ain't everywhere.

1929
02:05:34,700 --> 02:05:37,700
So some people really... you know, you can't just go out and buy a Switch today.

1930
02:05:38,700 --> 02:05:39,700
You have to save up and do that.

1931
02:05:40,700 --> 02:05:44,700
So it's kinda... it can probably be irritating if you bought this game already with Kickstarter or what have you.

1932
02:05:45,700 --> 02:05:48,700
And then now here it is that it's not even gonna be coming out on the Wii U and it's gonna come out on the Switch.

1933
02:05:51,700 --> 02:05:53,700
Oh, Stoppy says I was being sarcastic.

1934
02:05:54,700 --> 02:05:55,700
Oh, okay.

1935
02:05:56,700 --> 02:05:59,700
Well, dammit, I was actually looking for some counter perspective here.

1936
02:06:00,700 --> 02:06:04,700
Where every gamer has a voice, even your sassy ass voice.

1937
02:06:05,700 --> 02:06:06,700
Alright, so okay.

1938
02:06:07,700 --> 02:06:11,700
I guess that is the only counterpoint I can think of is that not everybody can just run out and buy a Switch.

1939
02:06:12,700 --> 02:06:18,700
But you do have a year to save up, so you just start putting $5 in the piggy bank every week.

1940
02:06:19,700 --> 02:06:22,700
So here's another thing, a little tease I guess.

1941
02:06:23,700 --> 02:06:33,700
The official Secret of Mana Twitter account has shown a clip of Seiken Densetsu 3 running on the Switch.

1942
02:06:34,700 --> 02:06:39,700
Of course, that game never left Japan and it is a Japanese Twitter account.

1943
02:06:40,700 --> 02:06:42,700
Looks like it might be running in Virtual Console.

1944
02:06:43,700 --> 02:06:44,700
Oh, did you... you didn't see the follow up for this.

1945
02:06:45,700 --> 02:06:48,700
They actually did release this... they did announce the Seiken Densetsu collection.

1946
02:06:49,700 --> 02:06:50,700
So that was... so you must have missed that.

1947
02:06:50,700 --> 02:06:51,700
I did miss that.

1948
02:06:52,700 --> 02:06:53,700
That's why I'm here.

1949
02:06:54,700 --> 02:06:56,700
They are going to release in Japan and I think it's in June.

1950
02:06:57,700 --> 02:06:58,700
Somebody in chat correct me if I'm wrong on that.

1951
02:06:59,700 --> 02:07:00,700
Because again, we're winging it tonight.

1952
02:07:01,700 --> 02:07:04,700
If you're just joining us, we didn't get to produce tonight's show due to some website errors that were happening.

1953
02:07:05,700 --> 02:07:06,700
So we're winging it a little bit.

1954
02:07:07,700 --> 02:07:08,700
So that's okay that Loki didn't pick this up.

1955
02:07:09,700 --> 02:07:10,700
But, oh yeah, when I saw this come out on Twitter I was all over this.

1956
02:07:11,700 --> 02:07:12,700
So it's official, the Seiken Densetsu collection is happening.

1957
02:07:13,700 --> 02:07:14,700
So it's going to be 1, 2, and 3.

1958
02:07:15,700 --> 02:07:16,700
So that's Secret of Mana and Seiken Densetsu 3.

1959
02:07:16,700 --> 02:07:24,700
And then what is Final Fantasy Legend on Gameboy here will all be released on one Switch cart in Japan.

1960
02:07:25,700 --> 02:07:31,700
Now because the Switch is region free... you could buy that here in the US as well.

1961
02:07:32,700 --> 02:07:35,700
However, all those games are still in Japanese.

1962
02:07:36,700 --> 02:07:41,700
And the pack is going to cost like... was it 4,500 yen?

1963
02:07:41,700 --> 02:07:48,700
So it's like, it's going to be at least $40 for 3 old games.

1964
02:07:49,700 --> 02:07:51,700
Now, you know, they're not just any 3 old games.

1965
02:07:52,700 --> 02:07:53,700
4,800 yen.

1966
02:07:54,700 --> 02:07:57,700
Yeah, 4,800 yen. So again, that's around like 45 bucks, 40 bucks.

1967
02:07:58,700 --> 02:08:05,700
So if they release that in the US, well I don't know, are they going to translate those games for the US?

1968
02:08:06,700 --> 02:08:07,700
We'll have to see what happens with that.

1969
02:08:07,700 --> 02:08:13,700
I think that could be huge though. I think there will be people that will pay $40 for an English translation in Seiken Densetsu 3.

1970
02:08:14,700 --> 02:08:15,700
It doesn't matter that that game is fucking old.

1971
02:08:16,700 --> 02:08:19,700
They would also translate Mother 3 and they would probably pay a lot of money for that too.

1972
02:08:20,700 --> 02:08:26,700
You know what? You know what? Depending on... Loki, this is a different time now.

1973
02:08:27,700 --> 02:08:31,700
I think that may not necessarily be off the table, if that makes sense.

1974
02:08:31,700 --> 02:08:38,700
Especially if they do translate this to English, and it does well, and I don't want to get too excited.

1975
02:08:39,700 --> 02:08:44,700
I'm tempering my enthusiasm because I don't expect that they're going to go back and make an English translation in Seiken Densetsu 3.

1976
02:08:45,700 --> 02:08:48,700
Well, do you want to hear my controversial opinion on this?

1977
02:08:49,700 --> 02:08:53,700
Why not? Why not? Let Rob get some hate mail for a change because not everybody is going to agree with me on this.

1978
02:08:54,700 --> 02:08:58,700
I think they should just snatch the translation that's already been done and put it out.

1979
02:08:58,700 --> 02:09:06,700
And some of you are going to be like, the fuck? That was a fan translation that people did. Yeah, well...

1980
02:09:07,700 --> 02:09:08,700
What are you going to do about it?

1981
02:09:09,700 --> 02:09:10,700
It was Square's game. What are they going to do about it?

1982
02:09:11,700 --> 02:09:12,700
You going to sue them?

1983
02:09:13,700 --> 02:09:16,700
It was Square's game that you all translated so you could play it free in an emulator for a year.

1984
02:09:17,700 --> 02:09:18,700
That would suck.

1985
02:09:19,700 --> 02:09:21,700
It's time for Square to get some of their money back, so to speak.

1986
02:09:22,700 --> 02:09:24,700
I know that opinion is not going to be popular, but...

1987
02:09:25,700 --> 02:09:26,700
But it is something they could do.

1988
02:09:26,700 --> 02:09:30,700
If that's what they have to do to get the game out in English...

1989
02:09:31,700 --> 02:09:39,700
It may be what they're doing. Remember, there was the virtual console games that had ROM dumps that were done by other people that somehow ended up in there, so...

1990
02:09:40,700 --> 02:09:42,700
It's possible they could do that.

1991
02:09:43,700 --> 02:09:48,700
JD in chat says, what's the licensing on the fan translation? The answer I'm giving is, does it matter?

1992
02:09:50,700 --> 02:09:54,700
Again, I know that's not an opinion everybody's going to like, but does it matter?

1993
02:09:57,700 --> 02:10:00,700
It was Square Enix's game. It was their words originally, right?

1994
02:10:01,700 --> 02:10:13,700
It technically still is their game, and they could argue that you're in violation of the copyright by reverse engineering the game, so they could take it down the fan translation, even though that is something that people do.

1995
02:10:14,700 --> 02:10:29,700
Now JD does have a more reasonable counterargument here, saying the game company's lawyers are not going to use it unless the translation was done under the most copyleft license, meaning it was a broad license or whatever, because it leaves them open to a lawsuit.

1996
02:10:30,700 --> 02:10:31,700
But, I mean...

1997
02:10:32,700 --> 02:10:33,700
It's just words.

1998
02:10:36,700 --> 02:10:38,700
It would be interesting. I'm just saying it would be interesting.

1999
02:10:39,700 --> 02:10:40,700
It would be an interesting lawsuit.

2000
02:10:40,700 --> 02:10:47,700
I don't think that's what Square is really going to do. Now, to put all this wank aside, Square would localize it themselves.

2001
02:10:48,700 --> 02:10:51,700
They could do it. It would be morally wrong, I think.

2002
02:10:52,700 --> 02:10:54,700
It's going to be a very strange group. That would be a hell of a court case.

2003
02:10:55,700 --> 02:10:59,700
They could do it because, I mean, it's a big company versus just some people that did it for fun.

2004
02:11:00,700 --> 02:11:02,700
Who may not even care anymore. I don't know. I don't remember who did it.

2005
02:11:02,700 --> 02:11:07,700
They don't have the money to defend themselves, so, I mean, really, a big company could do this.

2006
02:11:08,700 --> 02:11:13,700
Though, people might not think too highly of them after they did that, but I don't know.

2007
02:11:14,700 --> 02:11:20,700
Interesting. So, Elliott B. in chat says, it's just words, me pirating a million ebooks.

2008
02:11:21,700 --> 02:11:30,700
Here's the thing, though. Now, did the fan translation, didn't they translate words that were already written?

2009
02:11:33,700 --> 02:11:36,700
Technically, yes. Or did they rewrite it?

2010
02:11:37,700 --> 02:11:38,700
They may have done both.

2011
02:11:39,700 --> 02:11:44,700
Okay, if they rewrote it, then I get that argument a lot more than if they just translated what was already written.

2012
02:11:45,700 --> 02:11:46,700
Because then I think that's a little apples and oranges.

2013
02:11:47,700 --> 02:11:53,700
It's technically derivative, but I don't know. That would be kind of a weird gray area. I don't know how that would necessarily work.

2014
02:11:54,700 --> 02:11:59,700
Let's see, BlackWolf in our chat over at live.vognetware.com says, podcasts are just words.

2015
02:12:00,700 --> 02:12:06,700
Well, I can make money off this show? When's that gonna happen? It's only year 15.

2016
02:12:07,700 --> 02:12:10,700
Well, you see, we need to have a Kickstarter and then a Patreon.

2017
02:12:11,700 --> 02:12:17,700
Oh, I gotta tell people it costs $35,000 a year to do a podcast. That's right. I gotta tell them we have studio fees to pay for.

2018
02:12:18,700 --> 02:12:20,700
We have to pay people to produce it for us.

2019
02:12:20,700 --> 02:12:22,700
You said the hookers aren't gonna pay for themselves, okay?

2020
02:12:23,700 --> 02:12:26,700
That's right, that's right. I forgot about all that stuff. Anyway.

2021
02:12:27,700 --> 02:12:31,700
Buying pizza almost every week is expensive.

2022
02:12:32,700 --> 02:12:38,700
Anyway, all this wank aside and the shade y'all are throwing at me, it's not gonna happen.

2023
02:12:39,700 --> 02:12:42,700
If Square Enix does the English translation, they will do it themselves in-house.

2024
02:12:42,700 --> 02:12:46,700
And we'll see. I'm just curious if they are gonna do it or not.

2025
02:12:47,700 --> 02:12:54,700
Because that is gonna be resources that are way more than probably packaging these three games otherwise on the Switch.

2026
02:12:55,700 --> 02:12:59,700
But the whole wild card with this is the fact that it is region free.

2027
02:13:00,700 --> 02:13:03,700
You will be able to buy this and it will play on your North American Switch.

2028
02:13:04,700 --> 02:13:06,700
So surely Square Enix has to realize that.

2029
02:13:06,700 --> 02:13:13,700
But, you know, I doubt there are a ton of gamer people there in North America that are fluent in Japanese.

2030
02:13:14,700 --> 02:13:20,700
It's all math. So if it makes sense for them and they can make money from it, then they'll do it.

2031
02:13:21,700 --> 02:13:25,700
It's all about what investment they put in it and what the return is gonna be. That's what it comes down to.

2032
02:13:26,700 --> 02:13:31,700
So let's hope that they experiment with something and it does well, then it just leads to more other things.

2033
02:13:31,700 --> 02:13:36,700
Yeah. I mean, come on. How long would it take to translate a game like that?

2034
02:13:37,700 --> 02:13:41,700
You already have people doing it. They could kind of crib some of that shit. I'm just saying, you know.

2035
02:13:42,700 --> 02:13:44,700
Don't open that door again. I already got enough shades.

2036
02:13:45,700 --> 02:13:51,700
But I will say this. It is at this point old technology.

2037
02:13:51,700 --> 02:14:01,700
So do they have all the old Super Nintendo stuff available to go in and crack the ROMs the way they could, you know, 20 years ago?

2038
02:14:02,700 --> 02:14:04,700
That may be the thing, is that they don't have the tools to do it anymore.

2039
02:14:05,700 --> 02:14:14,700
That's like handing me a reel, an audio reel, and asking me to edit it together when it's like, dude, everything went digital years ago.

2040
02:14:15,700 --> 02:14:20,700
They don't have the tools. I was unaware that these companies have no access to the internet.

2041
02:14:21,700 --> 02:14:25,700
It was so befuddling to me that they couldn't figure this out.

2042
02:14:26,700 --> 02:14:35,700
I think if people that are not associated with this company can make tools to do that, I'm pretty sure these companies can make tools to do that if they don't already have tools.

2043
02:14:36,700 --> 02:14:40,700
Because guess what? They put out virtual console games, so they obviously have some shit to adjust those ROMs.

2044
02:14:41,700 --> 02:14:44,700
Come on. Don't quit before you've even started.

2045
02:14:45,700 --> 02:14:48,700
All right. Let's move on. Let's go to another story.

2046
02:14:48,700 --> 02:14:54,700
All right, so this is kind of fun. Speaking of, like, I was talking about that whole water festival thing.

2047
02:14:55,700 --> 02:14:59,700
Guess what came out with the water festival thing for Pokemon Go?

2048
02:15:00,700 --> 02:15:04,700
The fucking thing breaking my Pokemon Go Plus all the time now, whatever that version of it is?

2049
02:15:05,700 --> 02:15:15,700
Yes, it does that, but no, I'm talking about something that'd be more interesting to a certain somebody that listens to the show and also has a show on our network who happens to be obsessed by this.

2050
02:15:15,700 --> 02:15:16,700
Shinies.

2051
02:15:17,700 --> 02:15:19,700
That's right. Only Magikarp.

2052
02:15:20,700 --> 02:15:22,700
Only Magikarp, but they have a shiny Magikarp now.

2053
02:15:23,700 --> 02:15:27,700
And so, yeah, it's a yellow Magikarp, turns into a red Gyarados.

2054
02:15:28,700 --> 02:15:32,700
By the way, for the record, on the way to the movie, I asked said person about that.

2055
02:15:33,700 --> 02:15:42,700
Because I actually, we were right by. I had to get work done on my car this weekend, so he was good enough to come pick me up at the car place so we could go to the movie while I was getting the car worked on.

2056
02:15:42,700 --> 02:15:48,700
And the car is right by one of the big Ingress farms out in Folsom, right?

2057
02:15:49,700 --> 02:15:56,700
So I was like, oh, well, while we're here, do you want to just drive through? Because I know this is a big farm for Ingress, so it's got to be a ton of PokeStops. You want to drive through and get PokeBalls?

2058
02:15:57,700 --> 02:16:00,700
He's like, I don't play Pokemon Go. I was like, did you not hear about the shinies?

2059
02:16:01,700 --> 02:16:07,700
So, by the way, if y'all want to know what happened to PokeStop Podcast, that's what happened to PokeStop Podcast.

2060
02:16:10,700 --> 02:16:11,700
Just saying.

2061
02:16:13,700 --> 02:16:14,700
Alright.

2062
02:16:15,700 --> 02:16:19,700
Anyways, so this is another thing that's going on with the Nintendo Switch.

2063
02:16:20,700 --> 02:16:28,700
So there's this company, Game Truck, who does these mobile trucks that you can rent and they bring them to locations and they have games inside of them.

2064
02:16:29,700 --> 02:16:38,700
Well, Nintendo's partnered with them now and they're going to have some that are going to be, 100 of the game trucks are going to have playable versions of 1-2 Switch and Legends all the breath of the wild on Switch systems.

2065
02:16:38,700 --> 02:16:41,700
And, of course, they're going to be adding Mario Kart 8 later on when it comes out in April.

2066
02:16:42,700 --> 02:16:47,700
So you can reserve your game truck now and they're going to have that promotion going on through June 20th.

2067
02:16:50,700 --> 02:16:51,700
That sounds incredibly boring.

2068
02:16:52,700 --> 02:16:57,700
I mean, I get it, the game truck thing and stuff, but who would want to watch you play Zelda?

2069
02:16:58,700 --> 02:16:59,700
It's a one player game.

2070
02:17:00,700 --> 02:17:08,700
Like, I get mobile, I get some land stuff going on there and Mario Kart would be a good choice for that, but it's like, I'm playing Zelda. Wow, that's cool.

2071
02:17:09,700 --> 02:17:14,700
Isn't that what Twitch lets me do? Like, whoa, I'm playing Zelda, other people can watch me. That's Twitch.

2072
02:17:15,700 --> 02:17:22,700
I mean, shit, even the PlayStation 4 SharePlay, if I don't want to be public about it, because Twitch is very public, right?

2073
02:17:22,700 --> 02:17:36,700
But I've done that where I play on SharePlay on PlayStation 4, so it's private, so that I'm not actually streaming online, I'm just streaming for somebody who, you know, wanted to see the game that can ask specific questions or whatever.

2074
02:17:37,700 --> 02:17:48,700
That's a very, uh, I mean, it's like, it's just like a, I don't know, camper show, like a, not a mobile home, but like a camper that they have games inside.

2075
02:17:49,700 --> 02:17:56,700
It's a very small room, they have like this stupid video on their website where all the kids are, like, cheering, the truck's coming down the street, I'm like, no, no they're not. No, they're not doing that.

2076
02:17:58,700 --> 02:18:03,700
Um, but like, they're all playing, let's see what games are they playing, they're playing Halo, they're playing fucking Halo.

2077
02:18:03,700 --> 02:18:06,700
They should have had those pictures of Donald Trump driving the truck.

2078
02:18:06,700 --> 02:18:09,700
They're playing, they're playing, they have eight player land Halo going on.

2079
02:18:09,700 --> 02:18:11,700
Okay, that's kind of cool though.

2080
02:18:11,700 --> 02:18:19,700
Yeah, and see, a mature rated game, by the way, nobody gives a shit about the fucking rated, you know, M rated games.

2081
02:18:20,700 --> 02:18:30,700
We had a conversation about this with some of the parents, because they were talking about like, you know, oh my god, that game has sexuality, that game doesn't have sex in it, because my son plays Call of Duty and like that stuff, you know.

2082
02:18:30,700 --> 02:18:32,700
No, just blowing people's faces off the guns, that's all.

2083
02:18:32,700 --> 02:18:37,700
Yeah, I'm like, yeah, you find people, you know, blowing heads off, but you're not finding sex, yeah, that's right.

2084
02:18:37,700 --> 02:18:44,700
Don't show them that scene from Mass Effect Andromeda, because I'm telling you, titty, Loki, there's full on titty in that game.

2085
02:18:46,700 --> 02:18:47,700
Uh, yeah.

2086
02:18:47,700 --> 02:18:48,700
Yeah.

2087
02:18:50,700 --> 02:18:53,700
Alright, should we open up Skype line? Want to open that up?

2088
02:18:53,700 --> 02:18:54,700
Let's do it.

2089
02:18:54,700 --> 02:18:58,700
Let's do it. Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype, if you want to give us a call.

2090
02:18:58,700 --> 02:19:02,700
Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype, if you'd like to give us a call.

2091
02:19:02,700 --> 02:19:07,700
We'll talk about whatever, or maybe we missed something that you want to talk about tonight, we can certainly do that.

2092
02:19:07,700 --> 02:19:09,700
If you want to do it the old fashioned way, you can do it that way too.

2093
02:19:09,700 --> 02:19:13,700
Actually, no you can't, because we got a call coming in right now, so let's get to it.

2094
02:19:13,700 --> 02:19:15,700
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

2095
02:19:15,700 --> 02:19:17,700
Hey, hey, it's...

2096
02:19:17,700 --> 02:19:21,700
Hey, you're cutting up a little bit there, but I think it's Rama, right Rama?

2097
02:19:21,700 --> 02:19:27,700
Yeah, I just had to finish doing a bunch of rebuilding on my machine, so it's a little temperamental right now.

2098
02:19:27,700 --> 02:19:29,700
Yeah, I'm getting that echo thing too, but what's on your mind?

2099
02:19:29,700 --> 02:19:38,700
Well, two things. Earlier in tonight's broadcast, you talked about people being gay and lesbian, and my thing is this, I don't care what you are.

2100
02:19:38,700 --> 02:19:41,700
Are we still going to the bar later? Yes or no?

2101
02:19:41,700 --> 02:19:43,700
Perfect, I'm fine with that.

2102
02:19:43,700 --> 02:19:51,700
Exactly. Do whatever you want to do to make sure you're... as long as you're happy, fuck it. I don't care.

2103
02:19:51,700 --> 02:19:55,700
As long as we can still chill, hang out, have a good time, that's all that matters.

2104
02:19:55,700 --> 02:19:58,700
Thank you very much. That and equal tax laws, that's all we have.

2105
02:19:59,700 --> 02:20:05,700
And secondly, the whole JonTron thing, I'm just going to put it like this.

2106
02:20:05,700 --> 02:20:19,700
When you are that type of person where you do camming, web shows, podcasting, you should not use that platform for your own political thoughts and views.

2107
02:20:19,700 --> 02:20:29,700
It's one thing to tell your listeners to fight for what you believe in, as opposed to saying, well, my views is dah, dah, dah, dah. That's the way it should be.

2108
02:20:29,700 --> 02:20:38,700
And if you know you have controversial views after throwing it out there the first time, maybe you should just kind of like keep that shit to yourself.

2109
02:20:41,700 --> 02:20:44,700
Well, it's complicated.

2110
02:20:44,700 --> 02:20:45,700
It's complicated.

2111
02:20:45,700 --> 02:20:46,700
Oh, I know. I know.

2112
02:20:46,700 --> 02:20:55,700
Because we sometimes say political things on this show. But as I mentioned a minute ago, I haven't made a dime off this show in 15 years.

2113
02:20:56,700 --> 02:21:12,700
Yeah, but Rob, the difference is what you've said on here isn't really political. It's like, it is, but at the same time, you say it in an aspect of, you know, what is wrong in this world, what we have to do, as opposed to going against the grain. You see what I'm saying?

2114
02:21:12,700 --> 02:21:18,700
No, I do. I do. And I would never, I would never encourage hateful rhetoric. Ever.

2115
02:21:19,700 --> 02:21:20,700
Exactly.

2116
02:21:21,700 --> 02:21:27,700
Anyway, I'm hearing myself through your speakers, so I have to wrap up a little bit. But any other last thoughts for us, Rama?

2117
02:21:28,700 --> 02:21:33,700
No last thoughts. I will be up for a while putting my machine back together.

2118
02:21:33,700 --> 02:21:34,700
Alright, have fun.

2119
02:21:34,700 --> 02:21:35,700
Have fun.

2120
02:21:35,700 --> 02:21:36,700
You too.

2121
02:21:36,700 --> 02:21:37,700
We'll talk to you on Tuesday. Bye.

2122
02:21:37,700 --> 02:21:38,700
Bye.

2123
02:21:38,700 --> 02:21:54,700
Anime Jam Session, of course, Tuesday nights here at the Voice Geeks Network, vog.network.com. Sorry, I hate cutting Rama short, but could you guys hear it too? I mean, I know you can hear it in the studio, you can hear myself coming back through, right? I don't know if that carried over over the air, but that was a lot going on there. Let's get to another call. Hi, you're on Orange Lawn's Radio, who's this?

2124
02:21:56,700 --> 02:21:58,700
Hi, can you hear me?

2125
02:21:58,700 --> 02:22:00,700
Hi, hello, you're on Orange Lawn's Radio, who's this?

2126
02:22:00,700 --> 02:22:02,700
Hi, this is Elliot B.

2127
02:22:02,700 --> 02:22:04,700
Hi, Elliot B. Wow, aren't you on the other side of the pond?

2128
02:22:04,700 --> 02:22:07,700
Not any longer, I actually moved to New York last year.

2129
02:22:07,700 --> 02:22:14,700
Oh, well, welcome, I suppose, even though I'm a year late, but what's on your mind? What's on your mind tonight?

2130
02:22:14,700 --> 02:22:31,700
Well, I was lucky enough to pick up a Nintendo Switch on Tuesday. I went by the Nintendo store at lunchtime, because I work in Midtown Manhattan, and they said, oh, we don't have any in stock at the moment, but if you subscribe to, you know, if you follow us on Twitter.

2131
02:22:32,700 --> 02:22:43,700
So I turned on Twitter notifications on my phone, and they happened to, and then 15 minutes later, they tweeted, oh, we've got some, we're going to have some in stock at three o'clock in the afternoon.

2132
02:22:45,700 --> 02:22:54,700
And that was at 2.30, I think. So I rushed out my office and got in line. There was about 20 people ahead of me already by that point.

2133
02:22:56,700 --> 02:23:00,700
And yeah, I got one, so I've been playing tons and tons of Zelda.

2134
02:23:00,700 --> 02:23:13,700
Congratulations. That's kind of a miracle that you happen to be in the right place and see that tweet and everything. That's everything lining up perfectly. That says a lot to the 20 people were still there ahead of you.

2135
02:23:13,700 --> 02:23:18,700
My question is, how many of those 20 people were scalpers? Dirty, filthy scalpers?

2136
02:23:19,700 --> 02:23:31,700
That's a good question. I don't know. I was only speaking to the people. There were a couple of people in front of me that was like a 15-year-old kid with his dad. I don't know how they both managed to get there, you know, with 10 minutes.

2137
02:23:32,700 --> 02:23:41,700
But yeah, it seemed like genuine fans in the queue. It didn't seem like, in the line, sorry, I'm still learning American English.

2138
02:23:41,700 --> 02:23:48,700
That's okay. We can figure some of the things out. We know a lift. We know a lift is an elevator. You know, same thing. We figured it out.

2139
02:23:49,700 --> 02:23:51,700
It's also not a taxi here.

2140
02:23:52,700 --> 02:23:53,700
It's not a what?

2141
02:23:53,700 --> 02:23:54,700
A lift.

2142
02:23:54,700 --> 02:24:08,700
Oh, I see what you did. Sorry, that was a little too complex for even me. I'm a big stupid American. I don't understand. Anyway, so you've been playing Zelda on the Switch and it sounds like you're having a good time?

2143
02:24:08,700 --> 02:24:21,700
Yes. I just beat the first Divine Beast today. And yeah, I'm sort of like, I beat that bit and then I'm used to kind of pass those. They're like, okay, now go on to the desert or something.

2144
02:24:22,700 --> 02:24:30,700
And now they're like, yeah, you've got this huge entire map that you can now explore. It's kind of overwhelming. But no, I'm loving the game.

2145
02:24:31,700 --> 02:24:35,700
I was thinking, do you remember when the first trailers came out for Twilight Princess?

2146
02:24:36,700 --> 02:24:37,700
Yes.

2147
02:24:37,700 --> 02:24:42,700
The Zelda that I was imagining from that trailer, this feels like that game finally, like a decade later.

2148
02:24:43,700 --> 02:24:54,700
A decade late. But no, I mean, just the openness of it. I mean, even Twilight Princess. I mean, I still enjoy Twilight Princess for what it is. But you were still in these narrow areas where your exploration was very limited.

2149
02:24:55,700 --> 02:25:06,700
Or at least in Heinz. I mean, I don't know, it didn't feel so limiting at the time. It just kind of felt like the way games were. But now in retrospect, hell yeah, those games feel so limiting compared to how open Breath of the Wild is, you know?

2150
02:25:07,700 --> 02:25:09,700
Oh, yeah, yeah.

2151
02:25:10,700 --> 02:25:17,700
Let me ask you this. Are you playing anything besides Zelda on the Switch? Because we know everybody with the Switch is probably playing Zelda, but have you checked anything else out?

2152
02:25:18,700 --> 02:25:26,700
Not really. I downloaded the... there's a demo. The only demo on the store is for that game. It's a co-op game where you have to cut each other out.

2153
02:25:27,700 --> 02:25:28,700
Oh, the Snipperclips?

2154
02:25:29,700 --> 02:25:33,700
Snipperclips, yeah. Which I quite like the demo to. It's kind of hilarious. Have you played it?

2155
02:25:33,700 --> 02:25:44,700
I actually have a little bit. A friend of ours had it and brought it over. We were playing for... I was watching him and Alan play. I didn't get to play a lot, but I did play a little bit of it.

2156
02:25:45,700 --> 02:25:52,700
It's definitely because it's a puzzle game, you have to kind of communicate. But I was getting really frustrated at one of the puzzles because I'm like, this is too hard.

2157
02:25:53,700 --> 02:26:02,700
Yeah, my girlfriend and I were playing the demo and I was getting so frustrated with her that I thought if I actually dropped the $20 on the real game, it might lead to some sort of breakup.

2158
02:26:03,700 --> 02:26:05,700
That's not good.

2159
02:26:06,700 --> 02:26:21,700
Not to throw shade on her gaming abilities or anything, but yes. It requires a lot of cooperation and a lot of trying to explain. Yeah, if you cut me in kind of exactly that exact shape, yeah, like more of a curve sort of thing.

2160
02:26:22,700 --> 02:26:29,700
Well, don't get Mario Kart or Mario Party either because those games can also end relationships, so be careful. Be careful.

2161
02:26:29,700 --> 02:26:35,700
Well, that probably is the next game I'm going to get, Mario Kart. I'm looking forward to that one. I need a good multiplayer game for this system.

2162
02:26:36,700 --> 02:26:49,700
I'm looking forward definitely to the multiplayer capabilities when you're in one room. I don't know if you do the conventions and all that stuff or just meetups with other gamers, but I think something like Mario Party is really going to kick ass in that sort of setting.

2163
02:26:50,700 --> 02:26:55,700
I just love the idea of carrying it somewhere and breaking out the Joy-Cons and passing them around.

2164
02:26:55,700 --> 02:27:07,700
Yeah, for sure, for sure. Alright, well congratulations on getting a Switch and getting down there to the store with, oh gosh, in 20 minutes. That's amazing that you were able to get over there so fast and end up getting a Switch.

2165
02:27:08,700 --> 02:27:13,700
Well, hopefully more will become available, as Loki was saying earlier, but there's still a scarcity right now.

2166
02:27:14,700 --> 02:27:16,700
It's amazing. They're out of stock in about half an hour.

2167
02:27:17,700 --> 02:27:22,700
Oh my gosh, wow, wow. Well, that's better than NES Classic Mini.

2168
02:27:22,700 --> 02:27:24,700
Whatever happened to that?

2169
02:27:25,700 --> 02:27:27,700
Oh, I'm sure they have one monkey working on that now.

2170
02:27:28,700 --> 02:27:35,700
I don't know about that. I think they're trying to get us to forget about that system even though it was like the biggest thing at Christmas, but whatever, whatever.

2171
02:27:36,700 --> 02:27:39,700
Alright, well, Elliot, thanks for the call and good to hear from you.

2172
02:27:40,700 --> 02:27:41,700
Yeah, cool.

2173
02:27:42,700 --> 02:27:43,700
Keep enjoying the Switch. Alright, take care.

2174
02:27:44,700 --> 02:27:45,700
Bye.

2175
02:27:45,700 --> 02:27:56,700
Bye-bye. Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype if you want to give us a call. Loki, I'll check in with you once again here before we close up the Skype line. See if you have any other stories you want to get out here.

2176
02:27:57,700 --> 02:28:00,700
Uh, no. I think we covered pretty much everything.

2177
02:28:01,700 --> 02:28:02,700
What?

2178
02:28:02,700 --> 02:28:20,700
Well, there's one article that's about Nintendo not necessarily going towards microtransactions in their mobile platforms, so they're saying, you know, I guess the Super Mario Run did not meet their expectations in terms of actually making money, even though it was downloaded 78 million times.

2179
02:28:21,700 --> 02:28:23,700
And they just released it on Android this week too, which is kind of a big deal, right?

2180
02:28:23,700 --> 02:28:34,700
They said that, um, they said that about 4 of the 78 million people, or, you know, 4 million of those, did buy the game, which is about 5%.

2181
02:28:35,700 --> 02:28:43,700
So they made $40 million. Well, no, because the store, okay, because Apple and so forth get a cut of, what, about 30%, right? So they made...

2182
02:28:44,700 --> 02:28:46,700
Like 20-some-odd million dollars on it?

2183
02:28:47,700 --> 02:28:54,700
Yeah, okay. Let's say we'll say half the money, because marketing, etc. I mean, they probably made more than 20 million, but still, we'll say that.

2184
02:28:55,700 --> 02:28:58,700
For an Android game. I think that's pretty damn good.

2185
02:28:59,700 --> 02:29:03,700
Interesting. Well, maybe they learned some things in the whole experience, though.

2186
02:29:04,700 --> 02:29:10,700
Well, in the figure, I mean, the Android version just came out, so, I mean, that was only a small portion of the marketplace out there.

2187
02:29:11,700 --> 02:29:16,700
They did wait an awful long time to put that on Android. I don't know if they had some sort of deal with Apple where they couldn't.

2188
02:29:17,700 --> 02:29:22,700
Well, remember, they were, I thought they were worried about the whole, like, copy protection garbage or something.

2189
02:29:23,700 --> 02:29:25,700
I don't know, that's a weird thing to worry about, but whatever.

2190
02:29:26,700 --> 02:29:29,700
Yeah, they were worried about piracy on the Android. That's what they were worried about.

2191
02:29:30,700 --> 02:29:36,700
But, I mean, but that didn't stop them with, what, Fire Emblem? Although, Fire Emblem, like, consistently talks to the, well, so does Super Mario Run.

2192
02:29:36,700 --> 02:29:38,700
Does it say Fire Emblem has to continuously talk to the only server?

2193
02:29:39,700 --> 02:29:44,700
Yeah, it does, it does, because my son's in the middle of a level, and I had to reset the router, and he's like, Dad, it stopped working!

2194
02:29:45,700 --> 02:29:46,700
Oh, no.

2195
02:29:47,700 --> 02:29:48,700
Which is stupid, yes, it is absolutely stupid.

2196
02:29:49,700 --> 02:29:50,700
You kicked your son off the game, you're so cruel.

2197
02:29:51,700 --> 02:29:52,700
I know. It's so terrible.

2198
02:29:53,700 --> 02:29:55,700
One more shout-out for calls, and then we'll close up the Skype line.

2199
02:29:56,700 --> 02:29:59,700
Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype, if you want to give us a call.

2200
02:29:59,700 --> 02:30:11,700
Rama and Chad Agreen, they should have gone to Android first, bigger install base. I don't necessarily agree they needed to go to either one first, just don't make it, like, how many months has it been since it came out on my phone?

2201
02:30:12,700 --> 02:30:28,700
Well, they're saying that even though, even the whole thing, the point was, though, even though they didn't make as much as they had thought they would on Super Mario Run, and even though Fire Emblem Heroes is doing pretty good, even with the microtransactions, they said they still want to stick with that kind of, you know, one price point.

2202
02:30:29,700 --> 02:30:34,700
Format that they don't sell the microtransactions. I think it's because they're kind of used to that.

2203
02:30:35,700 --> 02:30:39,700
Which is good. Any company that gets out of microtransactions is a good thing, I think.

2204
02:30:40,700 --> 02:30:45,700
Alright. Well, I guess nobody else is calling us, Loki. I think that's going to wrap it up for the Skype line.

2205
02:30:46,700 --> 02:30:52,700
But if you were just being shy, you can always email us as well. Participate at OrangeLoungeTrader.com if you'd like to send us an email.

2206
02:30:53,700 --> 02:31:04,700
Otherwise, I think that's probably going to do it for tonight's OLR. Not bad for having, you know, no production really going into tonight's episode, but luckily we had a game we ran about for a little while at the top of the show there.

2207
02:31:05,700 --> 02:31:15,700
Hopefully Dark Soccer is feeling better, and we'll be back next week. We're also going to be joined, as mentioned, next week by SacIGDA in preparation for the Sac Indie Arcade event.

2208
02:31:15,700 --> 02:31:25,700
I do want to remind people there will be no show that Sunday, so April 9th, there will not be an OLR because April 8th, we will have been broadcasting all day long.

2209
02:31:26,700 --> 02:31:32,700
There's so much going on on that weekend. I have not just one now, but two people coming in from out of town.

2210
02:31:33,700 --> 02:31:40,700
So I have plans. I know I have a rough life, right? But I have plans Friday night, I have plans all day Saturday, and now I have plans Sunday night when we would usually be doing OLR.

2211
02:31:40,700 --> 02:31:44,700
It's just like when it rains, it pours. But I'm looking forward to that weekend. It'll be a lot of fun.

2212
02:31:45,700 --> 02:31:53,700
It will be. It will. So looking forward to broadcasting from the Sac Indie Arcade event. We'll talk to Gabe about that next week, and hopefully Brie will be here too, whoever else might be coming from the event.

2213
02:31:54,700 --> 02:32:07,700
And then we'll be doing that on Saturday. I'm hoping maybe we can wrap all the post-production of that up real fast so that maybe Sunday night instead of OLR, if you miss the broadcast on Saturday.

2214
02:32:07,700 --> 02:32:15,700
I'm not going to promise this yet until I know I can turn it around fast, but maybe we can re-run it on into Sunday night when OLR would usually be on.

2215
02:32:16,700 --> 02:32:23,700
That's what I'm going to try to aim for. Even though it is quote-unquote all day, it really only ends up being like five hours maybe.

2216
02:32:23,700 --> 02:32:34,700
I think that's going to do it. Let's go around and get final thoughts. Oh, I do have to give a quick shout out as always.

2217
02:32:35,700 --> 02:32:41,700
If you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Launch Radio, please tell a friend or two about the show. Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice.

2218
02:32:42,700 --> 02:32:51,700
But not if the voices ain't here. So a nice five-star review on a place like iTunes or Google or wherever it is you found this show, that all goes an awful long way as well.

2219
02:32:51,700 --> 02:32:56,700
So we really appreciate all of that. Otherwise, do we have any final thoughts from Loki tonight?

2220
02:32:57,700 --> 02:33:14,700
I ordered some filament in preparation for my printer to be shipped at some point. But I ordered orange filament and purple filament. So maybe I'll make something related to one of the shows.

2221
02:33:15,700 --> 02:33:16,700
Why not?

2222
02:33:17,700 --> 02:33:18,700
That's why I ordered the printer though.

2223
02:33:18,700 --> 02:33:22,700
Yeah, start cranking out some stuff I can give away at DragonCon this year. You're a factory now.

2224
02:33:23,700 --> 02:33:24,700
A factory.

2225
02:33:25,700 --> 02:33:38,700
That's it. My final thought tonight is I'm looking forward to enjoying more Mass Effect because yes, overall I am enjoying it and trying to get better at multiplayer because right now it's pretty hideous, you guys.

2226
02:33:38,700 --> 02:33:50,700
It's pretty hideous. We'll see you in seven days to do it all over again. But until then, have a great week everybody. We'll see you next time here on Orange Lounge Radio. Thanks again for tuning in and staying with us. Good night.

2227
02:33:51,700 --> 02:34:07,700
