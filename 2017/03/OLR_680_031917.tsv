0	27000	This week, Rocket League Season 3 finally comes to an end, and while the Championship Series continues until one team is crowned, the rest of us get to start ranking all over again. Enjoy your new wheels, there's plenty more to discuss, and it all starts right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.
27000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	51000	Hello my friends out there on the internet, welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight with the 680th episode of our show for this March 19th of 2017. My name is Rob Roberts, here with you in studio with my co-host, say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
52000	57000	And is that what she wrote? Is that the murder she wrote?
57000	59000	I don't know.
59000	67000	Or as RuPaul says, which I don't talk a lot about the other podcasts I listen to on this show, but I had a five hour car ride today, which I'll get into later.
67000	76000	So I listened to a bunch of RuPaul's What's the Tea, because that could be a fun show. I like that show not just because it's RuPaul, and I'm sure you all like, you know, oh Rob likes Drag Race.
76000	79000	And congrats to RuPaul's marriage, by the way.
79000	83000	Thank you Techmaster Loki, who butted in the conversation, but hi Techmaster Loki as well.
83000	89000	Yes, congrats to Ru, who I think may have got married right around the same time I did. So hey, how about that?
89000	90000	Yay my Ru.
90000	99000	But what I wanted to say about that is, she was talking on the show today about murder she wrote, but she calls it this, she said, murder she done sat down and wrote.
100000	112000	So now I can't, and like in that RuPaul voice, so now I can't, like I can't get that out of my head. Like I'm worried halfway through tonight's show I might be like, Dark Sakura, let's talk about Squarespace.
116000	121000	The ads on some of these podcasts are pretty shameless, but I understand there's bills to pay, there's bills to pay.
121000	126000	Well Tech 2030 in the chat room said I should bring back, sup bitches.
126000	129000	And hello to the chat, everybody's getting introduced early tonight, hi chatters.
129000	130000	Sup bitches.
131000	136000	And if you want Dark Sakura to call you a bitch, you can join our live chat room over at live.voggenetwork.com.
136000	138000	I'll call anyone a bitch for free.
138000	145000	Where we do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice Geeks Network, voggenetwork.com, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show, 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern.
145000	151000	Dark Sakura, by the way, I'm going to embarrass her a little bit on the show, but I just want to give a very big thank you for Kitty sitting.
151000	152000	Oh yes.
152000	153000	Over the weekend.
153000	154000	I petted your pussy.
154000	157000	Because I, and you took pictures.
157000	158000	I took pictures of it too.
158000	159000	Without her consent.
159000	164000	But you, okay, so Alan and I took a little road trip out of town this weekend.
164000	169000	Did what we call an emergency trip to Disneyland and Universal.
169000	174000	So those of you that listen to OLR a long, long time know that Dark Sakura and I love Disneyland.
174000	177000	Why was it, Loki has to love Disneyland at least a little bit.
177000	181000	Not on the same crazed level that Dark Sakura and I are at, but Loki.
181000	183000	He has kids, he probably hates it now.
183000	185000	Did kids ruin Disneyland?
185000	188000	Well, no, they do ruin everything, so that makes sense.
188000	191000	But no, I haven't taken them to Disneyland yet.
191000	192000	Okay.
192000	193000	And you know what, that's fine.
193000	199000	I know a lot of newer parents that are like, oh, I've got to take the kids to Disneyland when they're two or when they're three.
199000	200000	I'm like, don't bother.
200000	202000	They're not going to remember until they're like six or seven.
202000	203000	No, no, no.
203000	205000	But it's free before they're five.
205000	206000	I thought it was only like three.
206000	210000	Disney wants that money.
210000	213000	There ain't no Squarespace paying Disney bills.
213000	216000	That's why Becky waited to take Julian until he was about to turn five.
216000	220000	Okay, well that, all right, if you're doing it to get around the entry fee, then that I get.
220000	225000	But yeah, I just, you know, don't pay for the kid if they're too young to have the memories.
225000	226000	That's all I'm saying.
226000	230000	Because I apparently went to Disneyland when I was four, but I don't remember at all.
230000	233000	But I went to Disneyland when I was eight, and I remember a lot more of that.
233000	235000	So anyway, where were we?
235000	237000	Dark Sakura, kitty sitting.
237000	243000	So Dark Sakura sat for the cat and it's not exactly, we don't exactly live around the corner either.
243000	249000	So Dark Sakura really had to take like a 20 minute trip out here to feed the cat a couple of times, which, you know, Alan and I do appreciate.
249000	250000	So thank you very much.
250000	251000	I had to bribe her.
251000	254000	Well, you got video and stuff and you were putting it all over Facebook.
254000	259000	Well, I only did it once on Facebook, but I sent the other one to you guys.
259000	265000	But I had to bribe her out of your underwear, someone's underwear.
265000	266000	Wait a minute.
266000	267000	She was literally sitting.
267000	268000	Wait a minute.
268000	269000	I don't know.
269000	270000	Hold on.
270000	271000	What just came?
271000	272000	What just?
272000	277000	Talk about, talk about murder she sat down and she wrote.
277000	281000	What kind of revelation just came up in episode 680 of the show?
281000	283000	The Dark Sakura was fucking digging through our underwear when we were home.
283000	284000	No, I wasn't.
284000	285000	She was, okay.
285000	294000	It was more that she was sitting on like a pair of pants and she was sitting inside the pants like she was about to put them on her legs and go to work.
294000	295000	Okay.
295000	296000	Okay.
296000	298000	And I was like Sanrio.
298000	302000	And then I heard meep.
302000	303000	She, she does that though.
303000	314000	She, she cuddles up against, so, so like a lot of married couples, the mister and I have a dirty laundry monster in our bedroom, especially, you know, right before a trip or something like that.
314000	316000	So it's something about cats.
316000	317000	I think a lot of cats do this.
317000	320000	They like to find the owner's dirty laundry and snuggle up against it.
320000	322000	And she does that a lot.
322000	326000	So she was sitting in the middle of pants, like she was going to wear them.
326000	331000	And so I bring out the bull, shake, shake, shake, shake, Katie, shake, shake, shake, shake.
331000	335000	And then I hear, she's got a little noise.
335000	336000	She's probably hungry.
336000	342000	And so I go in the hall and I put down a piece and she's like looking like, what, what do I do?
342000	344000	I don't, you're a different human.
344000	346000	She's super shy around people she doesn't know.
346000	349000	And even though she, she ought to know Jamie by now, but she just, she doesn't.
349000	350000	Food one.
350000	351000	Yeah.
351000	352000	Food one.
352000	353000	Food one.
353000	354000	So I lured her into where the rest of her food was.
354000	358000	And she's like, and let me touch her.
358000	359000	Nice.
359000	360000	So I petted the pussy.
360000	361000	Well, thank you very much.
361000	362000	It's much appreciated.
362000	364000	You know, Alan and I are trying to favor some time.
364000	368000	So you got to, you got to get to, have you been to Universal in the past couple of years?
368000	369000	No.
369000	370000	Okay.
370000	371000	I've never been.
371000	372000	Oh, okay.
372000	373000	Now here's the thing.
373000	380000	I do think overall Disney is more to do than Universal, but girl, Harry Potter, that ride
380000	381000	kicked ass.
381000	383000	Like I was really blown away by that ride.
383000	384000	That was amazing.
384000	385000	So.
385000	386000	I watched the making of it.
386000	387000	Do that.
387000	388000	Do that for real.
388000	392000	And just to answer and chat over at LiveDogNetwork.com Dungeon Buster says, did you try Butterbeer
392000	393000	Sky?
393000	394000	Of course I fucking did.
394000	397000	I don't drive all the way to Universal Studios and not have Butterbeer.
397000	398000	Yes, I had it.
398000	401000	And it was, it was really like, I almost want to get in the car and go back, just have more.
401000	406000	But I think all it really is, is a cream soda icy with like melted whipped cream on top.
407000	411000	And by the way, Alan is showing off his new Stein that he paid like fucking 30 bucks for
411000	412000	at the park.
412000	413000	Cause hello theme park.
413000	415000	Where's most Slytherin one?
415000	416000	We'll have to go back.
416000	418000	I have to go back.
418000	419000	Anyway.
419000	421000	Now that I have officially been resorted again.
421000	422000	Resorted again.
422000	423000	Well.
423000	424000	On Pottermore.
424000	426000	You definitely, you know, Alan and I will catsit.
426000	430000	You and you and Mr. Dan need to go plan a trip to a Universal and do the.
430000	431000	We have money and time.
431000	432000	You can do it.
432000	433000	You can do it.
433000	434000	I believe in you.
434000	435000	All right, look, we got to get to video games.
435000	437000	Say hello to tech master Loki.
437000	438000	And how are you?
438000	439000	Fine.
439000	440000	Good.
440000	443000	And by the way, folks, tech master Loki producing tonight's show since I had the road trip home,
443000	446000	uh, I thought tonight was going to be a wing it show.
446000	447000	We could have done that too.
447000	448000	But look, but look, you saved the day.
448000	451000	No, I mean, I, I, I, I, a little structure is good.
451000	453000	Like the show is not scripted people.
453000	457000	We don't, obviously it's the fun of live radio, but we'd like to have a little structure or
457000	458000	else this would just be a comp.
458000	462000	Like it, it's, it would be a complete cluster fuck of a podcast as opposed to the kind of
462000	464000	cluster fuck of podcasts that it is.
464000	465000	Yeah.
465000	466000	So appreciate it.
466000	469000	So if you don't like something we talk about tonight, blame Loki this time.
469000	470000	No, just teasing.
470000	471000	But, uh, yeah.
471000	474000	Um, everything else is going well this week.
474000	477000	Our programming, is that still a thing that you've been working on?
477000	482000	I took a break on Friday just because I'd been going at, you know, doing it solid for
482000	483000	the last few weeks.
483000	484000	So I took a break from it.
484000	491000	But the thing I was programming, um, which is basically a demo for a presentation we
491000	492000	were doing.
492000	493000	Um, that came out.
493000	494000	All right.
494000	497000	I guess for what it was, it's, you know, it's a prototype.
497000	501000	So, um, it was neat.
501000	503000	All right.
503000	508000	And they liked it because, you know, it's fancy compared to some of the other prototypes
508000	509000	we made.
509000	510000	All right.
510000	512000	Well, I'm, I'm excited to, uh, try something that you create.
512000	516000	Uh, if you ever get something that's a public release, I don't know how much I'm going
516000	521000	to work on that one because that's more of like, it's a prototype for something that
521000	524000	another team may eventually decide to develop.
524000	526000	I still may develop it later on.
526000	533000	Um, I don't know how interested anyone would be to try it, but, uh, it's, it's, it's different
533000	534000	I guess.
534000	536000	Um, and, but I actually do want to work.
536000	538000	Now that I've done that, I want to work on my own stuff.
538000	540000	So I may go back to that.
540000	541000	All right.
541000	543000	Although I've been playing Skyrim and stuff.
543000	545000	So, you know, that, that does eat into it.
545000	548000	We were talking about this before the show because, uh, over, over on Mr. Bobby Blackwell
548000	552000	show tonight, he was, I don't know if his chat room was teasing him or just pointing
552000	555000	out the fact that he has not progressed as far in Zelda.
555000	559000	Some other people have, but you know, every, everybody does what they can do with the time
559000	560000	they have the game.
560000	561000	Dan fell asleep playing it.
561000	562000	Yeah.
562000	563000	It's just, you do what you can do.
563000	566000	And I honestly, I'm probably not much further than he is, but Loki, I said, well, Loki,
566000	568000	how far did you get into it?
568000	569000	And he said, what would you say?
569000	571000	I played a little bit and then I went back to Skyrim.
571000	572000	Yeah.
572000	573000	A couple hours.
573000	575000	And then I went back to Skyrim.
575000	579000	So at least Bobby's probably further along than you are because of that.
579000	582000	I'm in this playthrough of Skyrim 80 hours in.
582000	583000	Oh my gosh.
583000	584000	Oh my gosh.
584000	585000	All right.
585000	586000	Anyway.
586000	587000	Uh, let's see.
587000	590000	I have my kids play, but I don't think they have multiple save slots in that game.
590000	591000	Do they?
591000	592000	In Zelda?
592000	593000	Zelda.
593000	594000	I don't think they do.
594000	595000	I think you're right.
595000	596000	Yeah.
596000	597000	So that was the only thing.
597000	598000	It's like, no, no, they do.
598000	599000	They do.
599000	600000	But there's just a ton of auto.
600000	601000	I take that back.
601000	602000	There's just a ton of auto saves in there.
602000	607000	That's why I'm like, because I remember the first time I played it, but he can't read
607000	609000	stuff and he's going to screw up my save if I let him do it.
609000	616000	So like if I just let him run around and like set fire to things, um, you know, I don't
616000	617000	know.
617000	619000	I may let him do that next week.
619000	620000	All right.
620000	624000	Uh, we're going to get into video game news stuff this week with you guys in our chat
624000	626000	room over at live.vognetwork.com.
626000	629000	Uh, talk about our gaming weeks as well in a moment, but I want to get into tonight's
629000	631000	kickoff topic, which is kind of a big one.
631000	635000	It's a controversial one, but it's one that's been talked a lot about on social media this
635000	636000	week.
636000	639000	So I want to get your take, uh, here in studio for my co-host.
639000	643000	And then I want to get the take out there online, um, as well, uh, in our chat room
643000	644000	over at live.vognetwork.com.
644000	647000	Um, and it has to do with reviews.
647000	649000	So y'all probably already know where I'm going with this.
649000	651000	That's the one word I have to say, and y'all know where I'm going with this.
651000	656000	Um, we talk about reviews oftentimes here on OLR, but I'm curious for you guys, how
656000	659000	much do reviews ultimately really matter to you?
659000	665000	And the reason why I bring this up, of course, is the hubbub of blue about, uh, Jim Sterling's
665000	666000	review.
666000	668000	And he's a, you know, he's a popular guy online.
668000	669000	He has his fans and so forth.
669000	677000	Um, he, he dared, dared OMG to give breath of the wild a mere seven out of 10.
677000	683000	And in, you know, true Twitter fashion has been cyber bully because of it essentially,
683000	690000	because I believe his score ultimately lowered the Metacritic score of Zelda by one point
690000	694000	and the Metacritic is another whole little thing we can get into, which, but Zelda went
694000	700000	down from a 98 to a 97, although to go for it to have been a 98 in the first place, somebody
700000	702000	else gave it lower than 10 out of 10.
702000	703000	Right.
703000	708000	So anyway, he gave it a lower score and what were the reasons he cited?
708000	712000	He, he talked about the, the, uh, durability system, the durability system, to be fair,
712000	713000	annoys me too.
713000	717000	Honestly, like all of his critiques were basically what I share with that.
717000	720000	I mean, they were just, the durability system is stupid.
720000	725000	It's, it's, I don't know what the purpose of it being in here is other than they want
725000	729000	you to try the other weapons maybe, or they're just trying to lengthen the, I don't know
729000	731000	what the point of it is.
731000	735000	But it's interesting because I feel like, and this is also, I think a difference between
735000	739000	you and me is that like, I recognize those things and I say, yes, they're negative, but
740000	743000	was my overall experience affected by it?
743000	746000	No, I probably would still rate this game very highly.
746000	751000	Um, I don't think I've played enough with it to settle on a final score of probably
751000	756000	what will be either ultimately a nine or 10, but I still feel like I would not have maybe
756000	761000	been as negative, but Jim Sterling has a right to use whatever criteria he wants and a seven
761000	762000	out of 10 isn't exactly bad.
762000	763000	DarkSakura, I know you're trying to jump in.
763000	768000	I want to ask all of these people, what does these people, everyone who's been getting
769000	775000	fussy at this guy, why the fuck do you care about someone else's opinion if it doesn't
775000	776000	match your own?
776000	777000	End of story.
777000	778000	That's it.
778000	779000	That goes to religion.
779000	780000	It goes to fucking politics.
780000	786000	Why did the fuck does it matter so much to you that you want to send death threats and
786000	791000	DDoS someone's site just for having a different fucking opinion?
791000	792000	Well, okay.
792000	799000	And to be fair, then let's take that statement and apply it to fucking reviews in general.
799000	807000	Why is our industry, I say are the games industry so fixated on reviews in the first place?
807000	813000	Because they want some sort of validation for the product that they've put out.
813000	820000	And these people are also probably paid voices and other people are too.
820000	825000	A good number of people in this world are really weak willed.
825000	827000	I'm going to just flat out and say it.
827000	833000	Some people only base their opinion off of the opinions of other people or use that as
833000	837000	their selling point rather than fucking try it for yourself.
837000	845000	But okay, I agree to that to a point, but there are friends of mine, you guys included
845000	850000	in that, where if you told me that, Rob, you just should stay the hell away from this game
850000	852000	or Rob, you should really take a look at this game.
852000	855000	I would let that weigh on whether I might play a game or not.
855000	856000	Does that make sense?
856000	858000	But you actually trust our opinions.
858000	859000	I do.
859000	860000	The thing is, this is a complete fucking stranger.
860000	861000	Am I a fool?
861000	862000	Just kidding.
862000	863000	This is a complete fucking stranger.
863000	869000	Okay, but some people feel connected to him the way that some of our listeners, this feels
869000	874000	really weird to say, but some of our listeners, I think we are in a position of responsibility
874000	878000	where sometimes the things we say may have an effect.
878000	883000	I'm not trying to sound delusional here, but may have an effect on whether our listeners
883000	884000	buy a game or not.
884000	885000	You know what I mean?
885000	888000	I still don't think that people should necessarily take our word for it.
888000	892000	They need to think for themselves, try it for themselves.
892000	899000	And there are ways of, you know, you can go to wherever to buy a game, play it for a couple
899000	904000	of days, and if you decide that it is not to your liking, return it.
904000	907000	There's still rental services out there online.
907000	911000	You know, there are ways to try before you buy.
911000	913000	No one is infallible.
913000	915000	Going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
915000	920000	SSJ100Matt says, I wish Metacritic existed when I spent my money on Silver Surfer NES
920000	921000	as a kid.
921000	924000	Alex P. Carson says, but you're God.
924000	926000	Well, I know that, but.
926000	927000	Now, now.
927000	930000	No, but still, you know.
930000	935000	So I was going to say, you know, I'm in the reviews here.
935000	936000	I just thought I'd read some of the comments.
936000	937000	OK.
937000	939000	Because, you know, you're not supposed to ever read the comments.
939000	941000	But we're going to for the sake of entertainment.
941000	945000	So the featured comment is drink bleach, you fat, miserable cunt.
945000	946000	That's just.
946000	947000	That's unnecessary.
947000	948000	It's unnecessary.
948000	951000	And it's just it's just that's just straight up cyberbullied.
951000	955000	Like, I laugh, but I laugh because it's fucking awkward.
955000	956000	You know what I mean?
956000	957000	Like, it's like, ha ha ha.
957000	961000	My this person might be a mass murderer and I got to go like.
961000	966000	Well, the other the other thing, too, though, is that I mean, when we ask our friends something,
966000	968000	we know things about our friends.
968000	970000	We know things.
970000	971000	We know their personality.
971000	973000	We know the other kind of games they like.
973000	989000	And if you've ever played a game that they enjoy and you enjoyed it, chances are their opinion will matter because they like the same things that you do in that or because, you know, oh, this person really is into adventure games and they'll be really critical of it.
989000	998000	And if they say, you know what, I enjoyed this game, then you know that this person who's normally critical of the genre enjoyed themselves and then you can buy the game.
998000	1012000	But I think, though, that you also have to look for the sake because as far as I'm aware, this Jim Sterling guy tends to like to shake things up anyway to give an unpopular opinion because it gives him attention.
1012000	1017000	In the long run, that's really is this whole attention grabbing thing.
1017000	1024000	And so that's why I really don't want to put a lot of stock into his words, because he does shit like that.
1024000	1031000	I'm also just bringing it up because he is the focus of all this right now and, you know, the comment that Loki read, you know, he's getting it.
1031000	1039000	But you do offer a fair criticism that it could be for attention.
1039000	1042000	It's not. And that's kind of the misunderstanding.
1042000	1043000	Go ahead. Go ahead.
1043000	1051000	That's kind of the misunderstanding with under, you know, he takes on a lot of different issues with different opinions on that stuff.
1051000	1055000	But I wouldn't say he does things strictly for the attention.
1055000	1059000	Yeah. I mean, now, don't get me wrong. I think there are things he does do for attention.
1059000	1063000	The whole the whole thing with the monetization on YouTube.
1063000	1065000	He made a brilliant counter argument for all that.
1065000	1070000	I think it's because it's yeah, it's it's just I think he figured that out by accident.
1070000	1072000	Yeah. But anyway, that whole thing.
1072000	1078000	But I mean, but that's not. Yes. Again, it's like not necessarily bad in a way, too.
1078000	1085000	I think his criticisms of Zelda were fine, like, and it's OK that he only gave it a seven of 10.
1085000	1090000	I think so. I'm not saying that matches my opinion or whatever, but I also recognize.
1090000	1094000	OK, flip the tables a little bit and let's say we're talking about movies.
1094000	1100000	Has there ever been an Oscar winning movie where you were like, that was a fucking bad movie?
1100000	1104000	It's not even like right. Probably just within the last 10 of them that won an Oscar.
1104000	1106000	You can probably think of one where you were like, you know, that movie wasn't very good.
1106000	1108000	I was super glad La La Land didn't win one.
1108000	1115000	All right. Or but OK. But as much as people are saying, you know, there's this backlash against La La Land,
1115000	1120000	it still did get 14 nominations. Right. So and I haven't seen it. I have no opinion.
1120000	1127000	But so there's a lot of that, whereas a lot of people disagree with the fact that that film should have even got nominated 14 things.
1127000	1134000	So our Suicide Squad one one, which I'm not I'm going to say I liked the makeup job in it, which was what it went for.
1134000	1139000	But it wasn't really that great of a move. That was all it was bad.
1139000	1143000	That was all it was was some good makeup, some good beaten. It wasn't even great makeup.
1143000	1149000	I mean, it was OK. It was I think there's other other movies that did way better.
1150000	1155000	But I mean, on top of that, though, I.
1155000	1164000	It's just I think that if you were going to go to look at a reviewer, don't just look at the the number read, read what they say about.
1164000	1168000	Yes. Yes. Don't do it. Yes. Yes. Don't do it too long. Didn't read.
1168000	1175000	I bet. I bet to a lot of people out there, if you took the score away from Jim Sterling's article
1175000	1182000	and you took the score away from another, let's say, nine out of 10 article to somebody who really didn't know the styles of the two reviewers,
1182000	1185000	I bet somebody would not be able to tell the difference is easy.
1185000	1189000	What? And you ask them, like, what score did this game ultimately get from this reviewer?
1189000	1193000	I bet. I bet you would get different answers. You know what I mean?
1193000	1201000	Well, and on top of that, you know, I the types of reviews that I enjoy, if they're going to do some kind of summary to the effect,
1201000	1213000	then they should have a pro con list, you know, and on top of that, too, reviews are opinions, you know, and opinions are like genitals.
1213000	1220000	Some people have to some people have different ones, but everyone doesn't look the same.
1220000	1228000	And you don't necessarily want to get into someone's pants to find out now before before some I get the email on this because I know it's going to be coming.
1228000	1233000	There's going to be an email or something or a chat. I'm surprised the chat comment hasn't happened yet that says, well, wait a minute, Rob.
1233000	1237000	What about a vog network dot com? Don't you guys review things and you leave scores?
1237000	1241000	Yes, we do. But a we use a different scoring system than out of 10.
1241000	1251000	And a lot of thought went into that because especially with things like video games, you're you like we use the schoolhouse grading basically because an F is failure.
1251000	1255000	Everything above an F at least has like some redeeming qualities to it.
1255000	1262000	Right. Whereas I feel like in gaming, anything below a five out of 10 or fuck now in this case, a seven out of 10 is viewed as a failure.
1262000	1265000	And I feel like the great how schooling gives you a little more leeway with that.
1265000	1272000	But the more important thing is that we also encourage on our website for people to leave their own counter opinions right there.
1272000	1277000	And as long as you don't say, what was that drink bleach, you fat cunt or whatever those get moderated out.
1277000	1287000	But as long as the review is intelligent, we're perfectly happy to put here is a dissenting opinion right next to the review score that we gave it.
1287000	1293000	But I still don't think that people should in general put their soul.
1293000	1299000	Right. Judgment right on the opinion of somebody else, even on a review that's on our site.
1299000	1307000	And who cares if it's Metacritic went from 98 to 97. Oh, shit. It's 97. I'm sorry. I can't buy that game anymore.
1307000	1312000	But on top of that, though, it's just like I have I have a friend.
1312000	1319000	I mean, I'm sure everyone in this room knows this particular friend of mine who will was always only saying, well, they got bad reviews.
1319000	1323000	I don't want to play it. It got bad reviews. I don't want to play it. And then I'll go and play the game.
1323000	1326000	I'll be like, whatever. This was really great.
1326000	1335000	You know why? And there's there's some games that you're going to like more than another gamer, just because it's the type of game that you're into.
1335000	1340000	For example, or or and music games. Right.
1340000	1346000	I'm going to openly admit I'm always going to have a little more leeway in my heart for a music based game.
1346000	1354000	That's just, you know, music games are part of the reason why this show exists. Music games are, you know, a big part of my passion and so forth.
1354000	1360000	So there's always going to be a little bit part of me that just because it's a music game, I'm going to kind of look over and be like, oh, maybe I should try that one.
1360000	1365000	Now, of course, one could argue it also can make me more critical of a bad music game.
1365000	1368000	Being groovy. Yeah. Well, that that's just a bad game period.
1368000	1376000	But, you know, there's there's a little bit of that coming on is that sometimes your your own little like personal like genres that you're into and things like that are going to going to come into play.
1376000	1380000	The other thing I would say with this, OK, like Blaster Master Zero.
1380000	1383000	I've been playing a lot of that game since it came out on the switch.
1383000	1387000	And I think that game is getting like maybe eights, sevens and eights.
1387000	1390000	Like it's it's doing good, but it's not like Zelda good. Right.
1390000	1397000	But like for me, that game is a 10 out of 10 for me.
1397000	1404000	But even if I were to like review that on VOG, I wouldn't necessarily give it an A plus because I recognize that the game is flawed.
1404000	1411000	But for me, I still embrace it flaws and all because it's the type of game that I just I really enjoy.
1411000	1418000	Well, and to go back to what I was saying about, you know, it wasn't the right term I meant for it, but the weak willed comment.
1418000	1425000	It more has to do, I think, with people who are so looking for a validation of their own opinion.
1425000	1429000	Yeah. That the moment something gets a contrary score.
1429000	1435000	Yeah. They take it as personal insult. Yeah. And no, that means you need you need help.
1435000	1446000	I mean, seriously, when you go in and you think that it's OK to call somebody something like that because of a difference of opinion, you know, that's not OK.
1446000	1457000	Now, when this difference of opinion is being used to repress entire groups or to take away health care from people, that's a different story.
1457000	1461000	But if it is just I don't like this game that you like.
1461000	1465000	Fuck you. It's entertainment. You don't. These are all this is all entertainment.
1465000	1471000	It's not that serious. You don't have the right to be a shit to somebody just because they don't like the same game you do.
1471000	1476000	Something you want to interject, Loki? Oh, I said or DDoS their site. Yeah.
1476000	1480000	Yeah, of course. Trying to look in chat, of course, over at live.vognetwork.com.
1480000	1484000	MXC says to me, review scores don't deserve to be viewed as particularly important.
1484000	1489000	It's the words of a review which really tell you someone's view. But no one wants to read words.
1489000	1496000	That's why I made the review score on my site images of alpacas because it's mostly meaningless and cute.
1496000	1501000	I like that. Bobby, we should talk about alpacas.
1501000	1507000	Let's see. They're floofy. What's that? They're floofy. They are very floofy and fun.
1507000	1513000	And you can make hats out of their fur. Although then again, we probably shouldn't steal a scoring system from someone else's site.
1513000	1520000	So I will retract that comment. Tigerclawnchat says, it's things like that why I distance myself from fandom in general.
1520000	1525000	When someone crosses the line, you want no part of it. We'll rate them based on like cuteness of a puppy.
1525000	1531000	So we'll have like a really ugly picture of a puppy. Yeah, but even ugly dogs can be cute. Like that's that's all subjective.
1531000	1539000	Exactly. Isn't there like an ugly dog's website and like like uglydogoftheday.com or something and like people will go there and be like,
1539000	1547000	Oh God, that dog is so ugly. It's so precious. I love it. You know, right? Like there's no such thing as an ugly dog.
1547000	1554000	Let's see. SH2100matt in chat says, the sad thing is that the Internet will forget this reviewer and their review in a few weeks.
1554000	1561000	Angry Internet has a short attention span, which is sad that they cause all this damage for what they will care about for a short time.
1561000	1567000	So let me let me transition into this a little bit. I know we have other news stories about this game later on tonight.
1567000	1574000	I don't want to I don't want to put the cart before the horse. But speaking of reviews and all this stuff, it goes without saying,
1574000	1578000	I have to bring up some of this early stuff that's coming up for Mass Effect Andromeda.
1578000	1585000	So there is a lot of like early stuff out there. We'll get into some of the nitty gritty of it a little later.
1585000	1593000	But Dark Sakura, knowing that people are playing Mass Effect Andromeda on Origin right now and seeing some of the feedback out there,
1593000	1600000	does that affect your anticipation for the game whatsoever? No. No. Me neither.
1600000	1607000	You know why? I'm taking a lot of that stuff with a grain of salt right now because A, the Blaster Master Zero comment I made,
1607000	1617000	some things I'm just going to be more into than others. And that's OK. And B, just the fact that after what happened with Mass Effect 3,
1617000	1625000	I don't trust social media in general to get it right. I just don't. After what happened with Mass Effect 3's ending and all that bullshit,
1625000	1633000	like, in my opinion, although yes, Extended Cut made the Mass Effect 3 ending stronger and I'm glad it exists,
1633000	1640000	I think the internet got way fucking bent out of shape with Mass Effect's ending and it was a total fucking mob mentality
1640000	1643000	and I feel like the same thing is happening with Andromeda.
1643000	1653000	I've seen some of the videos that they're posting of like, here's some of the bad animations and honestly I have to stare at them like I don't see what the bad animation is.
1653000	1658000	I mean there were some that were silly, like I got stuck in a crouch animation, which is fine, it's a glitch.
1658000	1664000	But I didn't see anything that was like, holy shit, my face is missing Ubisoft type thing.
1664000	1671000	Yeah, and it's like, OK, a lot again. Not that I'm giving the industry a pass, I mean games need to be tested.
1671000	1676000	But, I mean, god, don't we see the same shit in Ubisoft games? Bethesda games?
1676000	1684000	I think, oh god, Bethesda's no for that shit. I think it's even worse with Ubisoft games.
1685000	1693000	I don't know, I mean I haven't really seen anything too bad yet, and so what, I like watching those videos, I think it's funny.
1693000	1702000	Yeah, well you know, I can take a fucking joke, like there's the Mass Effect, what are those videos that Alan watches, I don't even know if he's listening,
1702000	1709000	is it called YouTube Poop or something like that where they do the bad cutscenes and they take the dialogue and they splice it together
1709000	1715000	and that's the one where Shepard's like, well bang, OK. That shit is funny to me, that's OK.
1715000	1718000	Or they make the really ugly characters.
1718000	1725000	And sometimes there are bugs in video games and yet those bugs can actually be a little charming.
1725000	1732000	And that goes all the way back to the NES days. Sometimes there are funky things that happen with retro titles that actually make them a little charming.
1732000	1741000	Hell, that character in Zelda II The Adventure Link, where it goes, I am error, wasn't that whole thing a mistranslation or something?
1741000	1743000	It was supposed to be like Errol or something.
1743000	1747000	Yeah, and now you see that shit on t-shirts.
1747000	1756000	So, anyway, I don't know, I just, yeah, TigerKlineChad says, Mass Effect Andromeda is the result of fans wanting more Mass Effect,
1756000	1760000	so the developers have to come up with something that doesn't shit on what happened during the previous games.
1760000	1766000	Well, I mean, I get that's why the story is what it is and they had to distance it from the initial trilogy,
1766000	1772000	but I don't know, I just, this is one of those games where I'm not going to fucking listen to the internet,
1772000	1776000	I'm going to play it for myself and see what I think, I'll let you all know what I think,
1776000	1780000	and then you can take my opinion and let it weigh on yours or not.
1780000	1784000	I'll tell you whose opinion I've taken into account has been Shane's.
1784000	1786000	He's only played multiplayer.
1787000	1792000	No, he played single player. He finally cracked. He played single player.
1792000	1796000	But I took his opinion on multiplayer because I know he would be critical of it.
1796000	1797000	Right.
1797000	1801000	And so his opinion mattered to me. It was the type of opinion I was looking for.
1801000	1806000	But he's also a friend who's as enthusiastic about Mass Effect as you are,
1806000	1811000	and so you expect that his opinion is going to align closely with your own.
1811000	1818000	And that is why I think that going to a reviewer, a stranger,
1818000	1824000	doesn't necessarily make a good reason to try or not try a game.
1824000	1826000	You should go to the people you know.
1828000	1835000	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, run.
1835000	1839000	And also maybe in the case of Jim Sterling, because certainly he has his fans,
1839000	1844000	and he makes funny YouTube videos like we were talking about earlier,
1844000	1848000	that make good points sometimes with the whole YouTube money thing and all that.
1848000	1851000	Well yeah, that's just YouTube bullshit that he figured that out by mistake because...
1851000	1855000	Or the Konami shit. He did a great job with that. He really did.
1855000	1856000	Yeah, fuck Konami.
1856000	1858000	So he did a great job with all this stuff.
1861000	1864000	Again, I kind of go, but a 7 out of 10 is also not a terrible score.
1864000	1867000	It's not, it's just people overreacting. That's what it is.
1867000	1870000	Anyway, am I into Zelda games? I'm probably going to be okay with it.
1870000	1874000	He's got to take it in your gut reaction. It's like, okay, was that overreacting? Yes, that's overreacting.
1874000	1881000	But also, read or listen to, depending on what you're doing with him, what he's saying,
1881000	1884000	and make your judgment based on that because maybe you'll be reading the thing and say,
1884000	1891000	oh, it's just durability and these things. Like, I don't think, that just sounds like a harder Zelda game,
1891000	1893000	and I've been looking for that. I'm okay with that.
1894000	1900000	But there's a difference between a harder Zelda game like Zelda 2 and bullshit durability system Zelda
1900000	1906000	with the fucking Radio Tower shit where you got climate. That is fucking dumb. It is pretty dumb.
1906000	1908000	No, I like the towers.
1908000	1917000	Zelda isn't perfect, but it is one of the most well polished games in a very, very long time.
1917000	1921000	No, I'm not going to argue that it's not polished, but my god, they didn't need the durability system in there.
1921000	1926000	You know I agree with you, but it doesn't ruin the game for me.
1926000	1933000	They can tone it down like a sword shouldn't be breaking. Maybe you can have it where it just does less damage after a while.
1933000	1939000	I would love for there, and some people are going to strongly disagree with me, so have at it.
1939000	1945000	I would love for there to just be an easy mode in Zelda, and in easy mode, the weapons take three times as long to break.
1945000	1947000	Or they don't.
1948000	1950000	I could see where you'd get overburdened, because everybody's telling me like,
1950000	1954000	oh Rob, at the end of the game you get weapons so fast that you don't even know what's going on.
1954000	1960000	Okay, that's great if I'm going to make it to the end of the game, because I'm getting annoyed at the beginning of it.
1960000	1964000	Then perhaps don't do that. If you have so many weapons that it's just an onslaught.
1964000	1970000	Like right now, I find myself using the weakest weapons that I have against enemies.
1970000	1972000	Because I'm like, oh shit, I want to break these good ones.
1972000	1976000	And that's kind of a stupid way to play. I would think you'd want to use the most powerful weapon.
1977000	1979000	It's because of the stupid system.
1979000	1982000	Granted, I've only played it for two hours, so it doesn't really bother me too much.
1982000	1989000	But I play Skyrim where I'm carrying literally, I mean granted I've, you know, glitched that game out to all hell.
1989000	1991000	Weapons break in that game, though.
1991000	1992000	No, they don't.
1992000	1993000	Oh, I thought they did wear down.
1993000	1995000	No, they don't. They never break.
1995000	1997000	You have to go to the blacksmith and...
1997000	1999000	To smith new weapons, to make new weapons.
1999000	2001000	I thought I had a durability thing.
2001000	2003000	No durability at all.
2003000	2005000	Alright, anyway.
2005000	2010000	So, you know, one other thing I'll say on this, and I swear I'll move on.
2010000	2017000	You know, you can take the opinions of your friends and the people online that you participate with.
2017000	2020000	Whether it be us or another show, or a YouTube or whatever.
2020000	2026000	You can take all that with a grain of salt and then form your own opinion on the games and have fun with whatever game it is you're into.
2027000	2032000	But the other thing that I've grown to really appreciate is the rise of streaming in all this.
2032000	2035000	With, you know, we were talking about this a little bit last week at Tava Show.
2035000	2042000	I think streaming has become a great way for me to check out, quote unquote, a game that I'm on the fence about.
2042000	2048000	And I have been swayed both ways on the fence on a game I was on the fence about by checking out streaming.
2048000	2054000	Because it lets me see a little more of the game in its natural habitat.
2054000	2060000	Outside of the parameters of what the PR team approved for cutting to be released and all that stuff.
2060000	2061000	You know what I mean, right?
2061000	2064000	Like, when you're seeing streaming, you're seeing the raw game being played.
2064000	2071000	So, that's another way that I, at least myself, will certainly, especially when I'm on the fence, have my decision made.
2071000	2072000	But anyway.
2072000	2076000	Let's talk about, well thank you SJ100Matt over in chat.
2076000	2080000	SJ100Matt says, this show has sold me on many games in the past.
2080000	2081000	Well, we appreciate that.
2081000	2085000	At the end of the day, if you like something we didn't like, we'll still take your call.
2085000	2086000	We still want to hear from you.
2086000	2092000	If you hated a game that we did like and you want to yell at us for having you spent 60 bucks you shouldn't have spent.
2092000	2096000	We will caution you that, hey buddy, you're the one that made the decision at the end of the day.
2096000	2099000	But we will still allow your counter opinion on the show.
2099000	2101000	We're happy to have it.
2101000	2109000	Anyway, let's talk about where our hard earned spent money has gone this week in a segment about the types of video games that we have been playing this week.
2109000	2110000	How is your gaming week?
2110000	2111000	DarkSakura.
2111000	2114000	It has been all Zelda all the time.
2114000	2117000	And some World of Warcraft.
2117000	2118000	Miitomo.
2118000	2119000	Best Move.
2119000	2122000	And Pokemon Go.
2122000	2123000	Busy busy.
2123000	2125000	Not really.
2125000	2126000	Alright.
2126000	2127000	And that's it.
2127000	2128000	That's it.
2128000	2129000	Loki, how about you?
2129000	2130000	How was your gaming week?
2130000	2133000	My gaming week, I played a little bit of Pokemon Go.
2133000	2137000	Just because I was still in midtown so there was lots of PokeStops there.
2138000	2142000	I played, I bought Zelda on Friday.
2142000	2146000	So I picked up that and I played a couple hours on Friday night.
2146000	2149000	But I haven't really played it since then.
2149000	2152000	Just because I've been really into Skyrim.
2152000	2155000	So in Skyrim I've been finishing, I've been doing different quest lines.
2155000	2160000	So now I've finished the Dark Brotherhood quest line.
2160000	2166000	I'm starting the whole Stormcloaks quest line.
2166000	2171000	And I'm going to be doing probably the Way of the Voice stuff as well.
2171000	2173000	So just kind of doing all that stuff.
2173000	2176000	And then maybe once I get around to it, do some of the side quests.
2176000	2179000	Clean all that radiant quest stuff I have up.
2183000	2185000	I'm really enjoying it quite a bit.
2185000	2189000	With Zelda, like I said, I played it a couple hours.
2189000	2191000	It was a pretty game. I liked it.
2191000	2197000	One thing that kind of annoyed me from the get-go is like I was trying to not use tilt controls.
2197000	2200000	Because I didn't realize it was turned on.
2200000	2205000	And so I was using the right analog stick and I kept wondering why I couldn't aim very well.
2205000	2207000	Because it just kept moving my cursor around.
2207000	2210000	And it's because the tilt controls are on.
2210000	2212000	Like they put that on default.
2212000	2217000	Because Nintendo has to fucking push their goddamn fucking tilt controls for every goddamn thing.
2217000	2224000	I wish there was like, hey, this is an option. Do you want tilt controls or do you want to use your fucking analog stick?
2224000	2231000	I wish that was given to me instead of just, hey, you're a Nintendo user so you're going to love those fucking tilt controls.
2231000	2234000	Because we need to justify putting that shit in there.
2234000	2240000	But once I figured that out, then that was alright.
2240000	2244000	Durability hasn't really bothered me too much yet, but still very early in the game.
2245000	2247000	It is kind of annoying.
2247000	2251000	But I think what's even worse is it's no whole inventory management shit.
2251000	2255000	It's fucking feeling a lot like No Man's Sky.
2255000	2261000	Where I'm getting all these weapons and it's like, oh shit, I got to manage my inventory and drop shit that I don't need.
2261000	2264000	So I was like, I don't need to be doing this and it was all the game.
2264000	2267000	I shouldn't be doing it. Just don't hand out as many weapons then.
2269000	2270000	I don't know.
2270000	2271000	So that's it.
2271000	2272000	Alright.
2272000	2278000	My gaming week, I must admit, was a little light because of the theme park trip that I did this weekend.
2278000	2281000	So that really ate into my gaming week.
2281000	2286000	Unless you want to count doing Buzz Lightyear and Midway Mania as gaming.
2286000	2289000	Because you know I got to ride those rides when I'm at Disneyland.
2289000	2293000	But yeah, I didn't really play a lot of games.
2293000	2296000	I was driving too, so I didn't really get to play on the trip or anything.
2296000	2298000	No Pokemon Go at Disneyland?
2298000	2300000	Okay, funny you should bring that up.
2300000	2303000	I binged on Pokemon Go. Thank god I have the plus, right?
2303000	2306000	So like, oh man, just everywhere.
2306000	2308000	Just walking around, it's like boop boop boop boop.
2308000	2313000	Not a lot of rare stuff, although we did spot an Aerodactyl, which I know is a 10k of a lot of people.
2313000	2316000	I have three of them by now, but I've hatched a bunch of them.
2316000	2322000	But I know that was the one Pokemon that a friend of mine, who by the way never gets super into video games.
2322000	2326000	He's always been like a casual gamer, but he's like fucking super into Pokemon Go.
2326000	2328000	Like he's further along than I am.
2328000	2334000	And yeah, the Aerodactyl was the one thing he needed to complete his Gen 1 decks, right?
2334000	2339000	So like I always would give him shit, and every time I see one or I hatch one, I'd send him a screenshot and I'd say,
2339000	2342000	Hey, you should come visit, or whatever.
2342000	2345000	So funny enough, I did that when I was at Disneyland.
2345000	2348000	I sent like a screenshot and I said, hey, look at what's over here at Disneyland.
2348000	2349000	Do you have an excuse to come?
2349000	2352000	And like five minutes after I sent that, he said, look what just hatched.
2353000	2354000	OMG, I'm shaking.
2354000	2356000	And he got his Aerodactyl finally.
2356000	2357000	So it was funny.
2357000	2362000	But anyway, Meryl's were the thing that I don't see a lot of otherwise.
2362000	2365000	So I don't know if there was a nest there at California Adventure or something, but that was that.
2365000	2367000	But here's the thing.
2367000	2374000	So finally at night, around probably like 8 or 9 o'clock, like every time I would catch a Pokemon,
2374000	2377000	my Pogo Plus would be like, you've been disconnected.
2377000	2378000	And I'm like, what the fuck?
2378000	2380000	And I was getting really, really annoyed.
2380000	2384000	Well, it turns out, reading some stuff online and so forth, my battery died on the trip.
2384000	2387000	So I used that Pogo Plus all day long.
2387000	2392000	And keep in mind, I use that thing when I do lunch breaks at work to get walking credit for the eggs.
2392000	2398000	I've walked around downtown for, God, just when JD was visiting last week, we walked around downtown
2398000	2400000	and I was using that thing nonstop.
2400000	2403000	So I'm not surprised the battery just fucking finally died.
2403000	2407000	But unfortunately, I didn't plan ahead and bring a spare watch battery.
2407000	2409000	So I didn't get to do any Pokemon.
2409000	2411000	They're not rechargeable?
2411000	2413000	No, they use watch batteries.
2413000	2415000	Oh, fucking hell.
2415000	2416000	You didn't realize that? No.
2416000	2417000	That's so stupid.
2417000	2418000	Yep, they use watch batteries.
2418000	2419000	Way to go.
2419000	2423000	Well, to be fair, they last a long time.
2423000	2425000	I mean, I'm a power user for those things, Loki.
2425000	2426000	They last a long time.
2426000	2427000	It doesn't matter, then that's fine.
2427000	2428000	Have a rechargeable...
2428000	2429000	That's dumb.
2429000	2430000	Yeah, no, that's not rechargeable.
2430000	2431000	That's so fucking dumb.
2431000	2434000	So, I guess get a rechargeable watch battery or something.
2434000	2435000	But yeah, so I have to switch it out.
2435000	2437000	I didn't get to use it at all at Universal.
2437000	2439000	So, I was really irritated.
2439000	2443000	But at the same time, I was like, okay, hey, your inventory...
2443000	2446000	Well, yeah, and I did to get my bonuses and here and there.
2446000	2448000	But that thing is a fucking drain on your phone.
2448000	2457000	We had to bring, excuse me, our giant battery that is the highest amount of volts of a battery you can bring on an airplane.
2457000	2464000	That's what we brought with us to Disneyland and had in our little bag so we could charge with us.
2464000	2466000	And so that was good for Disney that day.
2466000	2476000	But yeah, the amount of power I used when I couldn't play Pokemon Go versus when I was playing it on Saturday was just like a crazy difference.
2476000	2479000	So anyway, yes, there was that.
2479000	2481000	I did play a lot of Pokemon Go.
2481000	2484000	Otherwise, I continued playing Blaster Master Zero.
2484000	2487000	Honestly, didn't get to do a lot of Zelda this week.
2487000	2490000	And this may come as a surprise to some people too.
2490000	2494000	I know the Mass Effect Andromeda thing is on the early access for the EA subscribers.
2494000	2496000	I chose not to do it.
2496000	2502000	As much as Shane tried to get me on it, I don't know if he did this to you too, Dark Sakura,
2502000	2505000	but he was really trying to convince me to get the EA access thing.
2505000	2506000	But two things.
2506000	2511000	A, I knew I would be out of town all this weekend so the only time I would have got to play that would have been Thursday night.
2511000	2517000	And tomorrow night, assuming I don't get it early from Amazon, which sometimes happens,
2517000	2520000	but after the whole Switch debacle, I don't know if it will or not.
2520000	2525000	But also, B, I just kind of didn't want to support what EA was doing with that.
2525000	2531000	I just didn't want to support the whole, oh, you have to be a member of our Netflix thing to get a 10-hour early access.
2531000	2534000	I can fucking wait five more days to do it.
2534000	2540000	The fact that I did theme parks over the weekend I think helps, but I didn't want to do it.
2540000	2542000	So that was all.
2542000	2543000	Shane tried to tempt me.
2543000	2549000	I think multiplayer would have been a lot of fun, but I was like, no, I can pack on Thursday night and do things to take my mind off it
2549000	2555000	and then I'll be ready for it on Tuesday when it arrives on PlayStation 4, which is where I'm doing it
2555000	2559000	because I'm curious about the whole PlayStation 4 Pro and all the stuff they've been doing with that.
2559000	2562000	I'm curious to see how that's going to look.
2562000	2564000	So we'll see.
2564000	2565000	All right.
2565000	2567000	Let's get into some gaming news.
2567000	2570000	I do want to just mention some quick housekeeping.
2570000	2573000	We will, I believe we are not going to be here.
2573000	2575000	I don't know if we firmly, firmly figured that out.
2575000	2578000	I don't think we're going to be here April 9th.
2578000	2584000	But that is the day after Sac Indie Arcade, which I think we did in years past anyway.
2584000	2592000	We're going to be broadcasting all day long that Saturday from the West Sacramento Convention Center with our pals at Sacramento IGDA.
2592000	2595000	Looks like some of the speakers have come out for this year's show.
2595000	2596000	It's going to be a lot of fun.
2596000	2600000	That will be all day long on VOG starting at about, I don't have the exact times yet.
2600000	2604000	I think it's going to be about noon Pacific for about five hours.
2604000	2607000	So we'll be broadcasting for the West Sacramento Convention Center that.
2607000	2613000	But the next day there won't be an OLR because of the fact that we would have streamed all day long before that.
2613000	2618000	And Jamie and I have a longtime friend who is going to be in town visiting from Japan that day.
2618000	2620000	So sorry, not sorry, guys.
2620000	2625000	But if we are giving you five hours the day before, we're going to take the night off to hang with our friend.
2625000	2629000	So that will be April 9th when that show will not be here.
2629000	2632000	So let's move on.
2632000	2635000	Otherwise, twitter.com slash OLR, facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.
2635000	2637000	Let's get into some gaming news for the night.
2637000	2638000	Loki.
2638000	2644000	Yeah. So according to a Wall Street Journal, Nintendo is supposed to be increasing their production of the switch.
2644000	2647000	So that's going to be up.
2647000	2653000	I guess they're going to be producing 16 million units for the next financial year.
2653000	2660000	So between, I guess, April 1st and March 31st of 2018.
2660000	2667000	Apparently, I guess they're saying that the switch broke the 48-hour sales record for console debut from Nintendo.
2667000	2670000	So that's pretty awesome.
2670000	2671000	Yeah.
2671000	2673000	Didn't we get into that last week, though? That's a little bit.
2673000	2679000	Yeah, a little bit. I mean, but this is kind of just more of just confirming that they're going to be making more.
2679000	2682000	These are kind of the receipts to what Reggie Fils-May was saying earlier.
2682000	2686000	Right. Well, that's more. I think it's still Reggie saying that to Wall Street Journal.
2686000	2687000	OK. Fair enough.
2687000	2689000	Yeah, it's still what they're saying.
2689000	2691000	The production going up is...
2691000	2693000	It is a good thing.
2693000	2695000	I want to see if the demand is going to sustain.
2695000	2698000	Why doesn't the classic NES production ever double?
2698000	2699000	That's what I'd like to know.
2699000	2700000	What the fuck is up with that?
2700000	2704000	I still like to pick up one at some point if they're even making them anymore.
2704000	2705000	I haven't seen one.
2705000	2708000	Well, I've never seen one on the fucking shelf. Never.
2708000	2711000	But it's ridiculous.
2711000	2715000	They shouldn't be able to produce a Linux computer that quickly.
2715000	2719000	I just figured at some point they were going to like fold that into the Switch.
2719000	2728000	Like they were just going to put out like a classic NES pack game for the Switch that was just going to be like a $30 game that would just have those same 30 titles.
2728000	2731000	And your Switch, voila, is an NES.
2731000	2733000	I'm just waiting for that.
2733000	2736000	At least the controllers would go further.
2736000	2738000	So here's something funny.
2738000	2744000	The Switch, of course, like most modern gaming consoles, has parental controls built into the Switch.
2744000	2749000	So you can monitor when your kids are playing and for how long and that type of stuff.
2749000	2754000	However, apparently it can be bypassed by merely going offline.
2754000	2761000	So if you take your Switch offline, then it will stop the tracking of playtime.
2761000	2763000	Whoops.
2763000	2772000	Well, but it does show an interesting component of how Nintendo's smartphone apps are tapped in through the internet through some type of central Nintendo server.
2772000	2779000	I'm thinking ahead to this whole voice chat thing that they're doing because I'm still really curious like how is that going to look through the app and all this.
2779000	2786000	And the bits and pieces that you're picking up about Nintendo is that this app is going to have more than just a fucking telephone.
2786000	2791000	Like they talk about what the whole schedule playtime session was with your friends and stuff like that.
2791000	2794000	Like they want to have something a little more robust than that.
2794000	2801000	So it's interesting how for a company that we razz over and over again for never being able to understand online,
2801000	2808000	it's interesting how Nintendo is now almost tapped, as this story might lead you to believe, too much into online.
2808000	2814000	Yeah, because apparently one of the things with the way this works, like so you set like, okay, my kids can play for four hours.
2814000	2819000	So if they take it offline, if they don't take it offline, then the console shuts off after four hours.
2819000	2824000	If they take it offline, it stops ticking that timer and then...
2824000	2828000	Because the console doesn't read the time online or whatever or something.
2828000	2836000	Yeah, which is weird that it couldn't just read the clock on the console and, you know, cache that stuff to the console because, you know, that would make sense in case of any sort of hiccups.
2836000	2843000	Unless what's really happening is that Nintendo's central server is sending the message that says shut off, playtime's over.
2843000	2847000	Like that message isn't, that message is coming from the cloud. Everything's being controlled from the cloud.
2847000	2853000	Wow, that'd be scary that that couldn't be exploited somehow if there's a way to send all those consoles to shut off.
2853000	2857000	Well, after clouds showed up in Smash Brothers, he's fucking everywhere now, Loki.
2857000	2858000	He is.
2859000	2860000	I'm gonna...
2860000	2864000	Just be glad, be glad, just be glad the parental controls are not run by Bayonetta.
2864000	2868000	He's gonna bust your gameplay by shutting your console.
2872000	2875000	Is this parental control, would you use this app with your kids, Loki?
2875000	2879000	No, I would just go fucking turn the system off. I'd be like...
2879000	2883000	You're gonna do it the old school way, like the parents just take the fucking cord.
2883000	2888000	It's not even that. Like, for example, now with their tablets, hey, time to turn your tablet off, which I know what that means.
2888000	2891000	I'm not gonna fucking turn my tablet off until you rip it out of my hands.
2891000	2897000	And that's what I do. I'm like, fuck it, I told you to turn that shit off. I'm taking it away now.
2897000	2900000	And occasionally I forget to charge it. You know, that too.
2900000	2906000	Has the kid ever given you a line like Jamie gave her parents, which she told on this show, didn't Jamie...
2906000	2909000	Didn't your mom take the cord away or something and you threatened to sue her?
2909000	2916000	She took my TV out of my room. I went and got it back and I said, this doesn't belong to you, it was given to me.
2918000	2921000	What happens when the kid pulls that, Loki?
2922000	2927000	I'll just put it up on a high shelf. He's short, he can't get up in there.
2927000	2928000	Fair enough.
2928000	2929000	I had a step stool.
2930000	2932000	He can get a ladder, he still can't reach it.
2932000	2938000	Just don't let your kids hang out with Aunt Jamie too long. Small doses.
2938000	2941000	I'll just delete his fucking app. He doesn't know how to download it.
2942000	2948000	Alright. Yeah, that was the old school way. My mom would just march in and she'd be like, where's the light?
2948000	2950000	Where's the light? And she'd hit it until she found the power button.
2950000	2956000	Especially if it's like the switch or something like that. It's like, fuck that, it's my turn to play that shit.
2957000	2964000	I didn't do that crap all the time. My daddy, I want to play stuff on the TV. No, it's my time. You go away.
2964000	2969000	Alright, well apparently there's this Wi-Fi glitch going on with the Switch.
2969000	2977000	I haven't seen a lot of this. In my bedroom where I play the Switch, sometimes before bed, and in my living room where the TV is,
2977000	2982000	I get three bar signal on Switch, but I'm told some people have issues with the Switch.
2982000	2987000	The Switch will lose, or the Switch is having bad Wi-Fi signal in other parts of the house.
2987000	2996000	Like just in places where it shouldn't be getting bad signal. Like my phone has perfect signal right next to the freaking router,
2996000	3003000	but my Nintendo Switch like loses Wi-Fi completely. So apparently there's some weird things going on with the Switch and Wi-Fi.
3003000	3008000	Now this is going around the internet. I don't know if y'all are experiencing this, but there's some sources out there.
3008000	3014000	Nintendo Life compiled a few of them that basically says that there are some frame rate drops happening on the Switch,
3014000	3021000	and this could be a flaw with the Wi-Fi feature. Apparently it's because of the auto-connect feature,
3021000	3025000	because if you go in and turn that feature off, you get a smoother frame rate.
3025000	3033000	So the rumor is that this auto-connecting that keeps trying to connect back to Wi-Fi is causing a frame rate performance issue in Breath of the Wild,
3033000	3038000	which I always assumed was just the game wasn't running as well at 900.
3038000	3045000	But I guess maybe people are seeing things like drop out where it was running smooth before.
3045000	3049000	I think that was pointed out by the developer Fast RMX.
3049000	3050000	Oh, interesting.
3050000	3056000	They realized that was the issue that they were getting. I thought maybe. Maybe I'm getting my stories confused.
3056000	3058000	Are they having problems with their online play or something?
3058000	3060000	No, I think they were having problems with their frame rate maybe.
3060000	3061000	Wow.
3061000	3066000	Maybe. I don't remember. I could be getting those two crossed, but I remember they made a comment about something.
3066000	3068000	I just assumed it was Zelda.
3068000	3070000	Maybe it could be Zelda.
3070000	3077000	Look at your friends list. It's like 19 of them are playing Zelda, and one of them is getting Binding of Isaac this week.
3077000	3079000	Very interesting.
3079000	3085000	So anyway, it does seem Nintendo is working on some type of firmware update for this,
3085000	3093000	but of course Nintendo is working on firmware updates anyway because the Switch OS is not totally done.
3093000	3101000	Again, we still don't know what the full online picture looks like, and we have a Splatoon test fire coming up next week.
3101000	3105000	So it's going to be an interesting weekend for the Switch.
3105000	3108000	I'd be curious if we get a big firmware update this weekend. We'll see.
3108000	3111000	I don't know. Anyway, moving on. Let's talk about something else.
3111000	3113000	Star Sakura, what do you got for us?
3113000	3114000	Sonic stuff.
3114000	3120000	So basically, Project Sonic 2017 is now named Sonic Forces.
3120000	3129000	I don't know if it's going to be any better than some of the other more current Sonic 3D games, but who knows?
3129000	3133000	It also has a logo, which looks very military.
3133000	3141000	But in other Sonic news, Sega is actually going to be holding back Sonic Mania.
3141000	3153000	It was supposed to be in spring 2017, but now it's going to be in summer for Switch PC, PlayStation 4, Xbox One.
3153000	3160000	So it's supposed to be a classic Sonic take, so maybe it'll be good.
3160000	3163000	Yeah, but Sonic 4 was supposed to be a classic Sonic take too.
3163000	3166000	Well, Sonic 4 was kind of crap.
3166000	3172000	Some comments in our chat over at live.vog.net.com. Dungeon Busters saying the Sonic Forces footage looked interesting.
3172000	3177000	Dark Tetsuya says, the vibe I got from the preview footage was very Sonic adventure-esque.
3177000	3179000	Yeah, but Sonic Adventure 2 was kind of crap.
3179000	3181000	So hopefully in a good adventure kind of way.
3181000	3185000	Act Def says, yeah, both Sonic Mania and Forces look great.
3185000	3192000	Alex P. Carson says, I really, really want a good Sonic game. We're overdue for one. Sweet Jesus.
3192000	3195000	Well, Generations wasn't bad, right? I don't know.
3195000	3196000	Generations was pretty good.
3196000	3202000	Yeah, I was kind of into Generations. And I always cut the, oh, those aren't really Sonic games. Or are they?
3202000	3205000	The racing games. Are those SEGA racing? No, they're Sonic racing, right?
3205000	3206000	I think they're SEGA racing.
3206000	3207000	I thought it was Sonic and-
3207000	3209000	Sonic and SEGA racing.
3209000	3214000	Oh, that's what it was. Sonic and- Sonic, his shitty friends, and SEGA pals all go racing.
3214000	3219000	I like those games, I think, a little more than the rest of the internet.
3220000	3225000	No, that's- I'm sorry, no, it was Sonic and SEGA All-Stars Racing is what it was.
3227000	3228000	Okay, that's- is that what it-
3228000	3229000	Sonic is-
3229000	3230000	Well, there was two- there was also two of them.
3230000	3234000	Yes, there was All-Stars Racing and All-Stars Racing Transformed.
3234000	3242000	Okay, that's it, that's it. So, looking in chat over at live.vognetwork.com, let's see, Act Def says Generations is one of the best.
3242000	3247000	Ice P in chat says, Alex P. Carson, try Sonic Utopia.
3247000	3249000	Oh, yeah, isn't that that fan one?
3249000	3250000	Yes.
3250000	3254000	Yeah, yeah, yeah. I never did get to try that, I wanted to, so, cool.
3254000	3260000	S200Matt says, I love Sonic and SEGA All-Stars Transformed, was amazing, I wish they would make more of that.
3260000	3266000	I kind of do, too. If nothing else, it's a reason to keep putting Ooh La La in games, so, you know, I'm all for that. Anyway.
3266000	3267000	Dark Soccer?
3267000	3269000	I want Space Michael to drive a car.
3269000	3275000	Are we at the point where that would be okay to do, or, you know, is this-
3275000	3280000	Oh, you wanna, okay, Complete Tangent, Theme Park Tangent, you ready for this? Okay.
3280000	3284000	So, guess what we learned about Star Tours?
3284000	3285000	What?
3285000	3292000	So, apparently, you know, you can ride that ride. If you've ridden the ride Star Tours before, you know there's several different configurations you can get.
3292000	3296000	And this is the new version that launched, what, about, god, it was almost five years ago at this point.
3296000	3298000	Still haven't been on it. Well, the original.
3298000	3311000	Okay, well, they have the new one, and so you get these different configurations where you might go to Hoth as the first planet, or you might go to, I keep wanting to say Terrain, like it's fucking Metroid.
3311000	3315000	I mean to say Tatooine. You can go to, like, these different planets, and then you get different closing planets.
3315000	3324000	But the middle segment is always a message from somebody, and the message can be from Admiral Ackbar, it can be from Princess Leia, it can be from Yoda,
3324000	3329000	or they just added recently BB-8, can also now deliver the message too in the middle.
3329000	3336000	But here's the thing, so Victoria, who's a dear friend of mine who I was going to see on this trip, she's like a Disney whore.
3336000	3342000	And I mean that in the best possible way. She actually dresses as the whore in Pirates of the Caribbean.
3342000	3345000	So I say that as a term of empowerment because she pulls it off great.
3345000	3347000	We wants the redhead.
3347000	3351000	Exactly. No, seriously, if you saw her dress, she's fucking amazing.
3352000	3362000	So anyway, we did the ride, she says, every time I ride this, I always brace myself in this middle portion that Princess Leia's going to show up, and I'm just going to fucking lose it.
3362000	3366000	And I said, Victoria, and sure enough, we rode it, we got Ackbar, right?
3366000	3368000	She's like, God, I'm seeing Ackbar all the time lately.
3368000	3373000	So I said, Victoria, I bet you anything, they pulled Leia out.
3373000	3380000	Because if you're afraid that you're going to have a reaction, think about all these other people, like 20 and 30-somethings are going to be riding a fucking ride at Disneyland
3380000	3383000	and then losing their shit halfway through because Leia shows up.
3383000	3388000	And so what did we do? We asked a cast member. We said point blank, did you take Leia out of the rotation?
3388000	3393000	And they just quietly like look around to see if anybody else is there and then kind of whispered to us, yes, we did.
3393000	3397000	So you can't get Leia on Star Tours right now.
3397000	3399000	I'm glad I've seen her.
3399000	3402000	Yeah. And it's not that they won't ever bring her back.
3402000	3410000	But now to loop this back to what you were just saying, you have to answer that question of when now will it be okay to do that,
3410000	3417000	where people aren't going to have that, and I know this phrase is overused online, but it's what it is, that trigger response.
3417000	3420000	That's what it is. This whole thing we're talking about is a trigger response.
3420000	3426000	So when are we going to be far enough from that? Is it a year? Is it five years? I don't know.
3427000	3433000	So that's what I'm asking with Space Michael. Can we put Space Michael in the game or is that still going to be raw for some people?
3433000	3435000	I think it's been long enough myself.
3435000	3437000	Yeah, it's been long enough.
3437000	3442000	Anyway, so go into chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
3442000	3445000	Bobby Blackwell says they added that when Force Awakens came out.
3445000	3449000	Yeah, I hadn't been in three years though, or the BB-8 thing is what he's referring to.
3449000	3455000	I hadn't seen that in three years, so I was actually hoping to get the BB-8 and the new stuff.
3455000	3459000	But sadly, we got Hoth and Ackbar, although I think Hoth is the best first configuration.
3459000	3462000	The Hoth sequence is pretty fucking rad, I gotta say.
3462000	3464000	Now, did you do Soarin' Over the World?
3464000	3468000	We did do Soarin' Over the World. I'm glad you asked.
3468000	3475000	So they changed Soarin' Over California to Soarin' Over the World, which now instead of going over all these random-ass places in California,
3475000	3482000	you go over famous landmarks like the Great Wall of China, the Taj Mahal, and these beautiful mountains and stuff.
3482000	3486000	So here's the thing. Yeah, I wrote it, and I walked off, I looked at Alan, and I said,
3486000	3489000	did that look fucking fake to you? Because the entire thing looked fake to me.
3489000	3492000	And Alan was kind of like, it was fake? He's like, the Taj Mahal looked really fake.
3492000	3497000	He said, but I think the rest of it was real. I'm like, oh no, that was all CGI.
3497000	3503000	That was all CGI. The animals, like the whales, he's like, well of course the animals were CGI,
3503000	3506000	but I'm like, no, it was all CGI. All of it.
3506000	3513000	So that's my only complaint with Soarin' is that it looks so good, because it's an HD movie now too,
3513000	3518000	but because it's HD, its fakeness is very apparent to me.
3518000	3525000	I almost wish for the film quality one back, but I think that one was really film,
3525000	3530000	except they probably added in the dude on the paraglider and the things that were in the old version of it,
3530000	3532000	but I think there was a lot that was legit.
3532000	3535000	They probably just like filmed it with a helicopter and took like, they also had like,
3535000	3538000	they capture the motion of it and everything so they can sink into it.
3538000	3546000	But I'm telling you, the Taj Mahal is the fucking fakest thing I've seen in a Disney ride in a long time.
3546000	3552000	It was like really obviously fake. But again, and then Alan perfectly summed it up in the way he always does.
3552000	3557000	He said, gosh Rob, it's almost as if they made that ride for kids or something.
3559000	3560000	And I was like, fine.
3560000	3565000	Yeah, but you know what? Okay, and then fine. Here's what they should do then instead.
3565000	3572000	Say fuck that's soaring over California, fuck soaring over the world, it should be fucking soaring with goddamn light planes.
3572000	3574000	Like fucking out of Tron, you know?
3574000	3575000	Yes.
3575000	3576000	That's what they should do.
3576000	3578000	Bring Tron back to Disney.
3578000	3583000	Alright, sorry. I know we got on a Disney tangent, but of course that happens here on the show.
3583000	3585000	I have to get to some of the comments in chat here.
3586000	3589000	S2100Matt says, Rob dropping the insider info.
3589000	3594000	Kaijuto saying, that person that spilled the beans on the Star Wars tour was thrown into a rancor pit after.
3594000	3600000	I hope not. He was a nice guy to tell us that. Be very blunt with us for that.
3600000	3606000	BobbyBlackWolf says, there is literally nothing on the internet that says anything about Leia being removed.
3606000	3609000	I think we just broke a story. Time to go to Wikipedia. Really?
3609000	3615000	Well, she's... But then, okay, you know what's gonna happen? Bobby, I'm gonna tell you what's gonna happen.
3615000	3623000	The minute you go and post it that Leia's been removed, somebody's gonna reply, nuh-uh, I just saw her.
3623000	3629000	Or, I have a friend that was just to Disneyland that just saw her and you vog people are a bunch of fucking liars.
3629000	3633000	It's gonna be that whole Shazam effect.
3633000	3635000	Or no, is it Shazam or Kazam?
3635000	3636000	Kazam.
3636000	3638000	Which one's the fake movie? Okay, Kazam.
3638000	3644000	I don't even fucking know anymore. I don't even know anymore. There's so many alternative facts on the internet.
3644000	3646000	I don't even fucking know anymore what's real and what's not.
3646000	3650000	Shaquille O'Neal, real. Sinbad, fake.
3650000	3656000	They'll be like, drink bleach, you fat, miserable cunt, vog network. I just saw Leia.
3659000	3661000	I shouldn't be laughing.
3661000	3666000	But you did tie that together very well. That was a good callback.
3666000	3668000	What do we call that? That was a good callback. Alright.
3670000	3671000	Anyway.
3671000	3673000	Hey, Dark Sakura.
3675000	3677000	How you doing over there?
3679000	3685000	Are you ready to go on Soarin' Over the World? Would you be okay if Soarin' Over the World just looked like total CGI?
3685000	3686000	No.
3686000	3687000	No?
3687000	3688000	I don't wanna go on it, actually.
3688000	3690000	Because you trust my opinion?
3690000	3695000	Not just that. I think the Soarin' Over the World thing was dumb. I would prefer Soarin' Over California.
3695000	3697000	Yeah, and now it no longer smells like oranges.
3697000	3700000	Yeah, but the place didn't actually smell like oranges to begin with.
3700000	3705000	When you fly over Fiji, it does, like, that's the only part of the ride that smelled to me was Fiji.
3705000	3711000	In a pleasant way, it smelled, before you guys think I'm making a joke here, that Fiji smelled like the beach.
3711000	3718000	And I was like, oh, that's nice. But that was the only part of the whole ride that I actually caught a smell with, was the Fiji part. So.
3718000	3724000	Soarin' Over California used to just give me, like, bad vertigo when you go over the mountain.
3724000	3728000	And so I just, I don't even think that I wanna watch the fakeness.
3728000	3732000	They didn't have you soar over, like, the middle of, like, China and just, like...
3732000	3733000	No, the Great Wall. You did the Great Wall.
3733000	3737000	No, just, like, spraying, like, a bunch of smog or whatever.
3737000	3740000	No, it wasn't that part of China. It was the beautiful Great Wall.
3740000	3746000	But I will say this. The one thing they knew not to change, and they didn't, was the beautiful music they used on Soarin'.
3746000	3755000	They did not really change the music except, okay, when you go through China, then the music gets all, like, starts being on a mandarin, right?
3755000	3756000	And all that stuff. When you go to the...
3756000	3757000	A mandarin?
3757000	3758000	Or what? What? What?
3758000	3759000	Mandolin.
3759000	3760000	Thank you. A mandolin.
3760000	3761000	A mandarin is an orange.
3761000	3766000	You know what? I've just been driving for five hours, so I don't wanna hear it.
3766000	3770000	Let's go squish, squish, squish, squish. Squish, squish, squish, squish.
3770000	3775000	I'm just missing that orange smell on Soarin', okay? Faken' leave me alone.
3775000	3777000	Soarin' was the ride I'd go on when my feet hurt.
3777000	3783000	And then, then the Taj Mahal got very, like, you know, like, total cultural appropriation, but...
3783000	3786000	So it was then played on, like, a sitar or something?
3786000	3788000	So it's like the, it's a small world after all.
3788000	3794000	Yes. It's, it's like the Disney version where it's like, ah, you let him get away with it because it's Disney and it's cute, you know?
3794000	3801000	Well, the best part about Soarin', though, is the intro done by the tick. Or the guy who played the tick.
3801000	3803000	And he's still, he's still there. Patrick Warburton is still there.
3803000	3804000	I love him.
3804000	3807000	They, they, they actually, they recycled the same fuckin' thing.
3807000	3808000	Yeah.
3808000	3809000	And it works. So...
3809000	3812000	We're gonna be soarin' over at the world today.
3814000	3819000	Alright, now everybody in chat is giving me shit. Bobby Blackwolf is like, the Mandarin was a Marvel villain.
3822000	3824000	MXC says, music on a Mandarin, lol.
3824000	3827000	ComeOnNoga says, problematic, lol. You know what?
3827000	3832000	They make that joke actually in the Lego Marvel cartoon where they all, who's on the phone?
3832000	3836000	Oh, the Mandarin. Ooh, I'll get my juicer. No, not that Mandarin.
3837000	3843000	And Dungeon Buster says, aw, looks like they replaced the Captain EO return with a Pixar short film festival feature now.
3843000	3850000	Actually, that would have been cool. A Pixar, I mean, Captain EO will forever live on in my heart, but a Pixar short film festival would have been awesome.
3850000	3856000	Disneyland has another fuckin' Star Wars thing in the theater. I mean, don't get me wrong. I love Star Wars.
3856000	3866000	But, Space Mountain right now. Star Wars. Star Tours. Star Wars. The old Eothear. Star Wars. Like, it's just, innovations turn into Star Wars.
3866000	3868000	Matterhorn. Star Wars.
3868000	3871000	It's being refurbished right now, so be careful what you wish for.
3872000	3874000	Alright, we need to get back to video games.
3874000	3878000	O.M.G., this 30 minute tangent on Disney. Loki, what do you have next for us?
3879000	3890000	So, Injustice 2 is going to be coming out with an unlock system using source crystals, which are basically in-game currency that you have to buy.
3890000	3901000	It's meant to be used for purchasing outfits or gear colors, but you can also use it to level up your characters as well.
3901000	3910000	So, for example, after you've leveled the character to the max level of 20, you can use source crystals to take another character of your choosing up to level 20 as well.
3910000	3915000	But, that can only be done if you have one level at 20. One character at 20.
3915000	3929000	So, apparently, they're saying that it's not going to be used for pay-to-win, but, yeah, I mean, you are technically speeding up the process of leveling up different characters.
3930000	3940000	And it's only for, you know, costumes, but different colors for outfits, different costumes.
3940000	3949000	Wasn't that a fucking staple in fighting games? Just fucking pallet swaps? Because I'm looking at this fucking picture of Harley Quinn here, and that's a fucking pallet swap.
3949000	3952000	I mean, that is a goddamn pallet swap right there.
3953000	3965000	She has a green and blue costume, or a pink and blue costume, or a black and red costume. It's a pallet swap. And you're charging money for that.
3965000	3972000	Well, if it's minimal in-game currency that you can earn anyway to get said pallet swap, then, okay, that's a little more in line with the Christmas shit.
3972000	3976000	No, I don't think you can actually earn this. You have to buy this. This is with real money.
3976000	3978000	What? No. Oh my god, that sucks.
3978000	3983000	Because they have another type of in-game currency, or another type of credits that you get for the actual gear.
3983000	3998000	So they have, like, stuff that you purchase new gear and stuff like that. But I don't think the source crystals you can actually use, I don't believe that you can actually use, like, you can't earn them in-game.
3999000	4005000	Wow. So, I mean, I'm gonna take a look and get some more information here to see.
4005000	4014000	So, their official announcement is source crystals can be purchased with real money, but aren't required to progress or advance in the game.
4014000	4020000	Can't be used to purchase gear or an advantage in gameplay. Doesn't say they can be earned in-game.
4020000	4029000	Source crystals can only be used to purchase cosmetic items and various shaders for different character costumes.
4029000	4034000	Yeah, literally purchasing skins and shaders. I mean, that's...
4034000	4043000	Yep, I hear ya. Back in the old Street Fighter II days, it was, you know, press the start button to get the pallet swap instead of one of the other buttons.
4043000	4046000	Like, I get it.
4046000	4052000	It says, do I have to pay for source crystals? Yes, real money is used to purchase source crystals.
4052000	4061000	That is fucking stupid. I just, I know, like, people are, like, gung-ho with, like, Overwatch and everything like that with, you know, loot crates and stuff like that.
4061000	4070000	Please, please, please, people that buy this game, don't support this kind of crap. Because this is ridiculous. It's only gonna get worse.
4071000	4076000	Alright. Well, let's move on. Let's talk about an emulator story.
4076000	4085000	So, you know, emulators, they're this grey legal area. I think all these game companies are aware that people use them.
4085000	4091000	And Nintendo probably is the only one that really goes after people like crazy for the emulator stuff.
4091000	4096000	At least, not like individuals who use them, but sites that create them and host them and so forth.
4096000	4102000	But this puts an interesting little wrinkle in that whole thing, because there's this Wii emulator out there called Dolphin.
4102000	4108000	Now, I've never used Dolphin, but maybe some of you have. Have you? Is it a good emulator?
4108000	4112000	Yeah, it's good. It does GameCube and Wii emulation.
4112000	4115000	Okay, I always thought, yeah, I remember hearing Dolphin back when it was a GameCube emulator.
4115000	4119000	I don't know if it does Wii U as well, but I know it does Wii and GameCube.
4119000	4134000	Well, here's the thing. The newest version of Dolphin apparently will emulate Nintendo's console to a point where you can actually use the Wii Shop Channel and actually use it to make purchases through your emulated Wii.
4134000	4139000	So you can, which yes, the Wii Shop Channel is still open. I know a lot of stuff on Nintendo's service closed.
4139000	4143000	But of course Nintendo is gonna keep the thing open the longest where they can take money from you.
4143000	4146000	So you can actually go onto the Wii Shop Channel, buy games.
4146000	4152000	Shit, you can get an emulator in an emulator. Go buy a virtual console title on the Wii in an emulator.
4152000	4155000	And yo, dawg, I heard you like emulators. So here it is.
4155000	4159000	So you can do that now. That's, uh, wow, that's very interesting.
4159000	4171000	Something else that is worth noting about Dolphin, you know, as much as Nintendo may not like the whole emulator thing, Dolphin does upscale Wii games into HD resolutions.
4171000	4177000	The original Wii was locked to 480p. So you can play things like Super Mario Galaxies and you can play Chronicles.
4177000	4186000	You can do this in HD through Dolphin. Dolphin will also allow you to export data to an SD card just like a regular Wii does.
4186000	4192000	So does that mean I can play something on the emulator, export it to my card, then take it to a real Wii and play?
4192000	4194000	I mean, it seems like that's a given at this point.
4194000	4198000	I don't know if you would be able to do that, but I could see maybe game saves?
4198000	4200000	Yeah.
4200000	4205000	So you could play, like, your game saves on there and then, I mean, that's pretty, pretty awesome.
4205000	4209000	I don't know why they don't do that anyways for just, like, different systems.
4209000	4215000	Like, imagine, like, the PSP and you could just have, like, an emulated version of the PSP, download the PSP app.
4215000	4218000	It's like you have the console and you buy digitally.
4218000	4223000	Uh, Brad from Pod Culture and Chat says, uh, wasn't Dolphin the name for a console, codename for a console?
4223000	4224000	GameCube.
4225000	4232000	And that was answered by Bobby Blackwolf in our chat, who also pointed out that I actually, apparently me, I have used Dolphin and I didn't even realize it.
4232000	4238000	That was the emulator that was running the F-Zero GX game that I tried in the Oculus Rift.
4238000	4242000	That apparently was a version of the Dolphin emulator but running on the Oculus Rift, so I didn't realize that.
4242000	4244000	So, okay, I have used Dolphin.
4244000	4250000	I bet Dolphin will run pretty well on your PC, get some F-Zero GX going on there, all HD and shit.
4250000	4253000	Yeah, that's tempting. That's super tempting.
4253000	4258000	I mean, here's the question I ask you guys.
4258000	4264000	Is it ethical? I'm not gonna ask is it legal, because the answer would be no, at least according to Nintendo.
4264000	4271000	Would it be ethical for me to use an emulator when I purchase the system and I purchase the game?
4271000	4275000	Is it ethical for me to use the emulator then to upgrade the game?
4275000	4276000	I think it would be.
4276000	4279000	Because, if I'm not mistaken, Dolphin runs off those disks, right?
4279000	4280000	Because you could pitch it.
4280000	4289000	I used an ISO for, the one I did mine for last time was the practice, because we had that Smash tournament for the little rotation thing that I did.
4289000	4294000	So I played Smash Brothers Melee using that, just to kind of play it a little bit.
4294000	4298000	And my laptop, it ran like shit, you know, it was okay.
4298000	4307000	Well, I wouldn't try to put those tiny disks in a laptop drive, but like DVD drives still had like the whole 3-inch disk instead of the inset.
4307000	4313000	I don't think that they would read those, because they're technically not DVD format, or they're not supposed to be DVD format.
4313000	4319000	They're supposed to be something different, but I think it does read the ISOs, but I mean, fuck, who cares?
4319000	4321000	I mean, granted, Nintendo would say it's illegal.
4321000	4324000	Oh, fuck what they care, I don't care.
4324000	4329000	But you have the game, you have the system, who gives a shit?
4329000	4336000	Yeah, and that's kind of where I'm at, where it's like, okay, well, I bought the system, I bought the game, so it's like Nintendo didn't lose any money here.
4336000	4347000	It's just that now I'm choosing to take said game and apply some filters to it to play it a little, maybe in a different way than the publisher intended, which is where Nintendo would say the problem is.
4347000	4356000	Well then that's their fucking fault, because you know what, they could be doing this shit with their consoles, where it's up-rezzing this stuff and looking nice, but they just refuse to do it.
4357000	4371000	So that comes down to the whole, why was Napster fucking popular or these online sharing sites for MP3s, because it was easier to get the MP3s through those sites than it was to buy them from the actual makers of the music.
4371000	4375000	So when it becomes easier to purchase it legit, then it will be.
4375000	4384000	Like imagine, say the Switch or something like that, let's just pretend that the Switch actually is powerful enough to run these games in HD, then imagine you could purchase them.
4384000	4395000	Like, okay, hey, we've got this back calendar, f0gx, okay, you can play it now in 1080p, 60 frames per second, it looks fantastic, it runs great, and you can do it with your Switch console.
4395000	4403000	Yeah, people will be dropping money for that shit like crazy, but no, Nintendo doesn't do that, because I don't know why.
4405000	4408000	Alright, I'm just looking at some of the comments in chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
4409000	4416000	Let's see, S2100Matt says, I wish the GameCube was named Dolphin. Yeah, well, the Wii was codenamed Revolution, remember that?
4416000	4420000	And it was like, god, that name was so much better for a lot of people, but they kind of made Wii work, though.
4420000	4428000	Anyway, Dungeon Buster says, if I own the game in the system, using an emulator and play them on another system seems fine, if not a bit grey to me.
4428000	4433000	Stoppy says, what if you own the game but not the console? Is it okay to play the game on your PC?
4433000	4439000	That's even more of a grey area. I think some would argue yes, because the game is what you purchased and you bought the software.
4439000	4443000	Technically they don't make anything off the console anyways, they may actually lose money, so...
4443000	4445000	Well, that's another issue.
4445000	4447000	In a sense, you're doing them a favor.
4447000	4456000	I would say it's one of the, it's a different shade of grey. I'm not saying there's 50 shades of grey, but there's a few shades of grey, and that's a little darker grey.
4456000	4462000	I'm surprised that they don't try to come out with something official to do this shit for older consoles.
4462000	4468000	Like, Wii consoles, why wouldn't you want to have more platforms for your games to be on?
4468000	4474000	Why wouldn't you want, like, this shop is open, you're literally putting out a program that you can go downslope stuff legit.
4474000	4478000	What's the problem there? I don't understand why you would have a problem with that.
4478000	4487000	Alright. Well, I have to say, ethical or not, especially now that you bring up this F-Zero thing, I'm like, I kind of want to check this out after the show.
4487000	4497000	And I own a GameCube, I've bought every system Nintendo's ever made, and I have a legit copy of F-Zero GX, so I feel like I should be able to do this.
4497000	4502000	Well, think about the virtual console games that you've bought over and over and over again, and then you probably own the original at some point.
4502000	4503000	Yes.
4503000	4506000	I mean, it's like, how many times have you paid Nintendo for the same product over and over?
4506000	4510000	I know, right? Like, you all love to give me shit over this Mass Effect 3 thing.
4510000	4515000	You all love to give me shit about how many times I've bought Mass Effect 3 and on what platforms.
4515000	4518000	Ask me how many times I've bought Super Mario Bros. 3.
4518000	4524000	The original NES version, right? The Super Nintendo remake and Lost Levels.
4524000	4529000	The Wii Virtual Console. I think I have it on 3DS Virtual Console, I think.
4530000	4538000	The Wii U Virtual Console. Oh, Super Mario Bros. Advance 4, also on Wii U, I have that too.
4538000	4548000	Exactly. So you spend that kind of money, you've bought that game dozens of times over, and they're gonna still call you a thief and a terrible person for downloading something.
4548000	4558000	Fuck them. Fuck you, Nintendo. Fuck you. I will download it and I will play wherever the fuck I want and go fuck yourselves.
4558000	4560000	Calm down. Calm down. Alright.
4562000	4567000	Let's see. Alex B. Carson in chat says, download a ROM and tweak the fuck out of it, Rob. You own it.
4567000	4571000	I wouldn't know what to do except change the sprites to dicks.
4571000	4574000	And that's what everybody did when ROM hacking first came out.
4574000	4577000	You had Super Penis Brothers, The Legend of Penis.
4577000	4582000	All the particles in, like, F-Zero, the dicks, just dicks flying into the creek.
4583000	4588000	Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, how do you really feel, Loki? I really wish you wouldn't censor yourself.
4588000	4590000	I know, I'm sorry.
4591000	4594000	And Stoppy gives you a nice hardy. You go, girl.
4595000	4598000	Alright. Dark Sock, right?
4598000	4601000	I'm sorry, just interrupt real quick.
4601000	4603000	I'm sorry, I'm used to men interrupting me.
4603000	4605000	Hey now. Hey now.
4606000	4614000	It's just like, you know, this even coming off of, like, Nintendo wanting a portion of your YouTube video profit
4614000	4619000	because they feel that they deserve that. Fuck them. I mean, seriously, fuck them.
4620000	4624000	I'm reaching for my volume down lever right now for Loki.
4625000	4628000	And I apologize if your eardrums got blown out a minute ago.
4629000	4631000	So how about something about Capcom?
4631000	4632000	How about you go, girl?
4632000	4641000	Of course. They are reproducing the Disney Afternoon with the Disney Afternoon collection. Yay!
4641000	4650000	We are going to be getting Chippendales Rescue Rangers 1 and 2, Darkwing Duck, you know, the terror that flaps in the night,
4650000	4657000	DuckTales, DuckTales 2, and TailSpin in one big collection for 20 bucks.
4657000	4661000	And it comes out the day before my birthday. Someone buy it for me.
4661000	4663000	All because of Darkwing Duck, really.
4664000	4665000	But all those games are awesome.
4666000	4672000	Yeah, but 20 bucks for the whole thing. It's going to be on Xbox, on Xbone, PlayStation 4, and PC.
4673000	4676000	That's great. So, okay, there's a couple weird things about this, though.
4677000	4682000	Well, one, this isn't a weird thing, but this is totally the sequel to the Mega Man collection, in a weird way.
4682000	4688000	Like, I think we have the Mega Man Legacy collection to thank for this. Some of the same people are involved, right?
4688000	4693000	I think some of the people we were talking about last week are involved with this as well. So that's kind of neat.
4694000	4702000	But the other thing that's really weird to me about this, okay, all those games in this collection, if I'm not mistaken, are NES games, right?
4702000	4706000	We don't have any Genesis games in there, right? They're all NES original games, right?
4706000	4709000	Yet, the Nintendo platform is the one that's missing.
4710000	4711000	Yeah.
4711000	4713000	So that part's a little weird to me. I mean, don't get me wrong.
4713000	4721000	Also, these screens, though, it looks like they've got them on smaller screens within the screen, which, I mean, maybe it's for the aspect ratio.
4722000	4731000	But it just seems kind of ridiculous to me. Like, I have no idea. It just seemed pointless.
4731000	4746000	I guess it's the same thing that happened with, oh, what was that game? Was it Mega Man X3 on Saturn had that kind of window around it? So I think it's kind of dumb.
4746000	4753000	Well, with a lot of the classic games that come out, like, now for the HD borders and stuff, they draw those borders.
4753000	4759000	I think, I'm pretty sure Mega Man Legacy had something like that as well. But you can also, you can futz with the aspect ratio.
4759000	4768000	It may not be locked to that. That might just be something they're using for the screenshots, Jamie, but sometimes with those games, you can, like, turn it off and play it at, like, original ratio or zoomed.
4768000	4771000	Those games usually give you control. I know Mega Man Legacy did.
4771000	4776000	And no bonkers or, uh, you know, goof troop game?
4777000	4779000	Still not good enough for you, unlucky.
4779000	4784000	Well, they're both Capcom games. They're both Super Nintendo games, so maybe that's the issue.
4784000	4795000	Maybe the sequel, maybe the sequel. I just, I kind of wish this collection was on the Switch. I'm like, now I'm turning into that guy where it's like, okay, I would like to be able to play this game on my TV or on the go.
4795000	4797000	Yeah, I'll tell you why.
4797000	4798000	I already know why, Loki.
4798000	4799000	You know why?
4799000	4803000	Because the same reason I bought Super Mario Brothers 3 17 times.
4803000	4807000	Because they're gonna, they potentially could release it on virtual consoles?
4807000	4808000	Individually, yes.
4808000	4809000	Yep, I know.
4809000	4810000	Because Nintendo are fucking greedy bastards.
4810000	4814000	However, however, however, wasn't Mega Man Legacy on Wii U? Am I wrong?
4814000	4820000	I may not, I honestly don't know because I didn't buy it on Wii U. I know the DuckTales remake was on Wii U.
4820000	4825000	But that was also, I believe, way forward that did that and not Digital Eclipse.
4825000	4827000	Did somebody in chat know? Was the Mega Man collection on Wii U?
4827000	4831000	I think it may have been. The only thing is that they would have had...
4831000	4834000	Okay, they are saying no. Alright, I'm wrong there.
4834000	4835000	Oh.
4835000	4839000	So I was confusing it because of the fact that DuckTales was on Wii U, but that was a different company that made it.
4839000	4843000	Because you would be devaluing their platform, Rob, with their virtual...
4843000	4850000	No, I'm serious. I know, I say this like, very like, ridiculously, but that is how they think.
4850000	4855000	They literally think that. That it would devalue their platform.
4855000	4858000	That's why fucking Animal Crossing doesn't have NES ROMs in it anymore.
4858000	4862000	I feel devalued on a regular basis sometimes.
4862000	4866000	And Nintendo, it's the horrible relationship we have with them.
4866000	4871000	Alright, give somebody else a try, Loki. Stop picking on Nintendo. Let's talk about somebody else.
4871000	4875000	Fine, fine. I'll talk about Sony.
4875000	4885000	So, Sony has, and this is, I equally love this service as much as some of the other Nintendo things I've been ragging on just now.
4885000	4889000	But PlayStation Now has got PlayStation 4 games coming to it.
4889000	4891000	Hooray!
4891000	4894000	So yeah, they're going to be adding those to it, and...
4894000	4896000	Can't wait to play Knack.
4896000	4898000	Yes, so...
4898000	4900000	I'm sure that, are those the games that are coming out for it?
4900000	4907000	It's not going to be Horizon Zero Dawn and the new shit. It's going to be the first wave of PlayStation 4 games, right?
4907000	4912000	I don't know that you really say what games are going to be coming out for.
4912000	4916000	But this is going to be starting, I guess, this year.
4916000	4922000	Now, the reason for that as well is because they're dropping PlayStation 3 and Vita support from PlayStation Now.
4922000	4928000	So you can't play those systems on the Vita or PS3.
4928000	4930000	But...
4930000	4935000	Yeah, so right now they've got 483 PlayStation 3 games on the service.
4935000	4939000	And they're saying that they're going to be adding PlayStation 4 games to it as well.
4939000	4941000	You know what would be neat?
4941000	4949000	I'm not going to expect that this is going to happen, but maybe Sony can give this one a little thought as to something they could sweeten the pot with at the E3 conference.
4950000	4958000	What if I already bought a game digitally, and so instead of having to have that game take up space on my hard drive,
4958000	4962000	because it's on my account, I can play it through PlayStation Now.
4962000	4964000	And now I'm not taking up space on my hard drive.
4964000	4969000	Granted, I'd be using my bandwidth through my cable provider, but at least I can make the choice.
4969000	4974000	Do I want to clear space on my hard drive to install this game, or do I want to play through PlayStation Now,
4974000	4982000	maybe this huge backlog of games I've bought with the PlayStation Plus service, and stream those instead?
4982000	4984000	Wouldn't that be kind of cool?
4984000	4986000	Yeah, that would be something.
4986000	4991000	And then same with all those PlayStation 2 games I bought on the PlayStation 3 or PlayStation 3 games I bought.
4991000	4993000	I wouldn't want to devalue the platform.
4993000	4995000	You wouldn't want to devalue the platform.
4995000	5004000	So the powerful PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 4 Pro are so powerful that they're unable to emulate PlayStation 1 or PlayStation 2 games.
5004000	5006000	This is just a broken record at this point.
5006000	5013000	Can Sony please just come out at E3 and say, okay, done. PlayStation 1 and PlayStation 4, done.
5013000	5016000	The PSP could fucking do that shit. I mean, come on.
5016000	5024000	You all have talked about how you want to buy a PS4 Pro, spend $400 on it so you can play PlayStation 1 games.
5024000	5026000	Fine. Here you go. Click.
5026000	5027000	I mean, seriously.
5027000	5031000	There's a tiny little button on the stage that they push. There you go. It's done.
5031000	5035000	They are getting their asses kicked by Microsoft when it comes to backwards compatibility,
5035000	5039000	because on top of that, like the backwards compatible games on Microsoft, I can play those on PC,
5039000	5043000	which begs the question, because I would have this conversation with a GameStop employee,
5043000	5046000	why would I want to buy an Xbox One at this point?
5046000	5050000	Because I can just get a PC and fucking have an Xbox One, basically.
5050000	5057000	Well, and interesting in that whole space as well, we were talking last week about PlayStation Now's competitor,
5057000	5062000	now with Microsoft, and the fact that in that program, you will be able to just download the games.
5062000	5069000	Exactly. Come on. Come the fuck on. You guys are getting your asses beat. It's so pathetic at this point.
5069000	5071000	And then the other thing was that...
5071000	5076000	But, Loki, to be fair, when it comes to the sales, and that's what really counts, Loki, they're not.
5076000	5081000	I mean, we can look at it with the critic eye, but at the end of the day,
5081000	5085000	and how did this point never come up in the beginning, opening moments of our show?
5085000	5087000	Then allow me to make it now.
5087000	5091000	At the end of the day, it doesn't fucking matter what any reviewer says.
5091000	5094000	It doesn't matter what you say. It doesn't matter what your friend on Twitter says.
5094000	5102000	None of it fucking matters. What does matter? Sales. 100%. That's what's important.
5102000	5106000	Will the game sell or not? That's why pre-orders are vicious.
5106000	5113000	Especially, you know, getting the pre-orders in before the embargo is lifted on games that might end up being stinkers and so forth.
5113000	5115000	So, at the end of the day, it's fucking sales.
5115000	5122000	So, that's what I'm saying, Loki, is that you could say, like, oh, well, Microsoft is dancing circles around Sony,
5122000	5126000	and I don't disagree with you, but at the end of the day, it doesn't fucking matter. You know why?
5126000	5130000	Because PlayStation 4 is dancing circles around Microsoft when it comes to hardware.
5130000	5136000	Because they have good first-party exclusives because they're making stuff in-house and they're making deals to get those titles,
5136000	5139000	which, you know, more power to them because they're great titles.
5139000	5146000	I wish Crackdown would come out, but, you know, that may be 2018 next time I hear about it.
5146000	5149000	I have a good feeling it'll be this year.
5149000	5156000	One thing I was also going to mention, in Japan, they are finally anti-production of the PlayStation 3 after 11 years.
5156000	5161000	So, that's going to be ending very soon.
5161000	5168000	I have to admit, this is kind of one of those Zsa Zsa Gabor was still alive pieces of news.
5168000	5174000	Like, you know, with all respect, when Zsa Zsa Gabor passed away, a lot of people were like, she was still alive.
5174000	5179000	So, that's kind of how I feel about the PlayStation 3 ending production.
5179000	5180000	Like, oh, that didn't already happen?
5180000	5184000	I still have my launch George Foreman, man. That thing is still running.
5184000	5189000	PlayStation 3 ended up being a great system. Didn't start as one, but it ended up being a great system.
5189000	5192000	So, I mean, it's sad to see it's day, but...
5192000	5195000	I didn't pay for it, so it's fine.
5196000	5197000	Alright.
5197000	5201000	I'd like a new Resistance game, though. I would like a new Resistance game.
5201000	5205000	Well, maybe somebody out there will hear your prayers.
5205000	5211000	Well, I know that finally I got my prayers heard and there's going to be a new Mass Effect game and I hope it's good.
5211000	5215000	I hope it's good, but this stuff gives me hope because this stuff sounds kind of neat.
5215000	5222000	Mass Effect Archives, it's a website that is coming and it will allow you to put your Mass Effect character where?
5222000	5224000	In the cloud!
5224000	5225000	That's right.
5225000	5230000	You can launch them into the actual space, the cloud of the internet.
5230000	5236000	This is something that folks with early access to Mass Effect Andromeda and the EA thing have noticed.
5236000	5238000	There's this thing called the Mass Effect Archives.
5238000	5244000	And so what you can do in the game, Character Creator, you can upload your character data or import it through Mass Effect Archives.
5244000	5248000	Is this for sick people like me who want to bring in their character from one platform to another?
5248000	5249000	It might be.
5249000	5254000	Anyway, you do need an internet connection to use the feature and that's about all we know yet,
5254000	5260000	but I'm sure we'll know a little more when Mass Effect Andromeda officially releases on Tuesday.
5262000	5267000	But in the meantime, you know what, while you wait for Mass Effect Andromeda and all these newfangled games,
5267000	5271000	you could take five minutes out of your damn day to appreciate a classic.
5273000	5277000	And that's what Dark Sakura does for a few minutes here on every week of Orange Lounge Radio.
5277000	5280000	She's going to dive into the gaming vault and find a game that she thinks,
5280000	5284000	hey, this game, wait, not you, you're Halo.
5284000	5289000	This game is a classic and you should be paying it a little bit of respect.
5289000	5294000	So Dark Sakura, what is the classic game of the week?
5294000	5296000	This is an unexpected pick from you, Dark Sakura.
5296000	5302000	Yeah, it's and it's a game that I had remembered playing right when it came out on Sega CD.
5302000	5309000	So it's Microcosm, which maybe not the best game, but it certainly was one of the early ones of its type.
5309000	5311000	It is a 3D rail shooter.
5311000	5315000	It was published by Psygnosis in 1993.
5315000	5320000	And one of the reasons I mentioned this because it was actually developed for the FM Towns,
5320000	5322000	which I brought up as a classic console.
5322000	5330000	It had been ported to Sega CD, Amiga CD32 and the 3DO consoles and MS-DOS.
5330000	5337000	So this one, the only real, I would say more widespread knowledge that people would have of it,
5337000	5340000	would quite likely be from the Sega CD.
5340000	5345000	It had it had full motion video animation backgrounds.
5345000	5350000	The rendering of such were done by Silicon Graphics.
5350000	5354000	And depending on where you're playing, it's either first person or third person.
5354000	5365000	So basically, you were playing inside of a body of a company presence is like set way in the future or something.
5365000	5373000	So you basically are having like what is the Fantastic Voyage or whatever it was in a body fighting off
5373000	5382000	different little nano droids that are trying to control this president guy and take over everything.
5382000	5386000	So the demo for this game came out in 1991.
5386000	5393000	It was for the Amiga CD TV and they had a port for the CD I cancel planned and then was canceled.
5393000	5395000	There is a prototype out there.
5395000	5404000	So then it was funded by Fujitsu to make it a launch title for the FM Towns Marty.
5404000	5418000	It was then released later on on other systems and it had a soundtrack done by Rick Wakeman and another version done by Tim Wright.
5418000	5421000	It had to do with licensing.
5421000	5428000	Looking up Rick Wakeman, he was a pretty much a prog rock guy.
5428000	5435000	So you can imagine the soundtrack microcosm really did get some very,
5435000	5440000	very high ratings for graphics, but not so necessarily great for gameplay.
5440000	5443000	It was really simplistic, to be honest.
5443000	5447000	I mean, for 1993, this game looks fucking great.
5447000	5450000	Yeah. For 1993, the game was amazing looking.
5450000	5452000	Now you look at it and you're like, oh, OK.
5452000	5456000	But you know, this this comes from a very particular era of gaming.
5456000	5460000	It does. Especially when we talk about computing like the Amiga and stuff.
5460000	5463000	And the really the big thing about it is that, like I said,
5463000	5474000	while it wasn't the greatest game of all time forever, it was notable that it was it was very.
5474000	5478000	What's the word I'm thinking of? It was a sign of its time.
5478000	5488000	It really displayed where people imagined games going with the full motion video, with the high end animation for its time.
5488000	5493000	And we had there were quite a few other games like that that came out like.
5493000	5498000	What's another one? Philosoma. Do you remember that one? I don't.
5498000	5503000	In fact, that was almost a classic game. But I brought up microcosm because I was trying to think of a game which was in.
5503000	5508000	Which means spoiler alert in a future week. I'm teasing.
5508000	5516000	Well, no, but hold on. I'm going to find something real quick about Philosoma, because it was.
5516000	5522000	It was originally what I was going to do. So, yeah, Philosoma was done in 1995.
5522000	5528000	It was for PlayStation. And the thing about it is that it was for a shooter.
5528000	5535000	It switched various directions, different points of view from it, really good music, too.
5535000	5543000	But it was more or less a in the same vein as Microcosm.
5543000	5549000	I would like to say that Microcosm was a precursor to this.
5549000	5555000	Of course, the sequel for Philosoma was Face Paradox, but I'll go into that if I ever do this game again.
5555000	5565000	But it was just really that mid early early to mid 90s kind of game where they wanted it to look a lot more.
5565000	5569000	It wanted it to be more immersive and have so much more going on.
5569000	5573000	And the technology, the time lent itself very well to doing it as full motion.
5573000	5579000	Like what were the other games of that era? Like Sewer Shark, for example, kind of along the same lines.
5579000	5583000	So more like Night Trap you did last week in a different in a different kind of way.
5583000	5587000	But it wasn't the game overlay on top of full motion.
5587000	5589000	I guess that's true. I guess that's true.
5589000	5594000	So I would say, but, you know, on its own, there were limited editions of this that came out.
5594000	5604000	The PC one and the Omega CD 32 came with the game, the manual, a soundtrack and a T-shirt.
5604000	5607000	So that's it. It's Microcosm.
5607000	5610000	Right. There it is, your classic of the week, Microcosm.
5610000	5616000	And we're looking at it in studio here on the Amiga, which is a system that doesn't get enough love here on O.L.R.
5616000	5620000	But it was on like a million systems in that era.
5620000	5626000	And it wasn't I would say that many. They were just more niche systems at the time.
5626000	5628000	Yeah. Yeah.
5628000	5632000	The Sega CD was probably the better accessible of them.
5632000	5637000	But there I mean, again, it was the FM Towns. They had a version set for the Marty.
5637000	5643000	The Amiga systems weren't that well spread around. And the 3DO. I mean, did you know anyone who had a 3DO?
5643000	5649000	JCPenney in the display. Did they ever sell a gaming system? Why did I name them?
5649000	5654000	I associated it with the mall. I think I meant to say Sears. Sears would have one in the display.
5654000	5657000	Montgomery Ward. Montgomery Ward. That's where I got my killer instinct.
5657000	5665000	I had 3DO. I was just I was just having this discussion with Alan today because you know where we went for the very first time in our lives.
5665000	5672000	I'd never been to before a super target because there's only one of them in Nor Calis that I know of.
5672000	5678000	And it's on the drive home from L.A. because we took the ninety nine back because I guess there was construction on five.
5678000	5682000	Ninety nine is the best. You pass the Bravo cheese farm.
5682000	5685000	And you know, we stopped there to a fucking love Bravo.
5685000	5689000	Get me some sage cheese. Oh, I didn't know you like that stuff. I would like garlic in the sage.
5689000	5694000	But anyway, well, we'll be back to L.A. someday. But anyway, not just that, but there's a super target in fucking Merced of all places.
5695000	5699000	And so I was like, well, I want to see what makes super target super. And I knew I knew it was like the grocery thing.
5699000	5703000	And I'm told and there's probably folks in chat that are like, what's the big fucking deal?
5703000	5708000	I'm told these are all over the place in the Midwest and stuff, but I had never been one been to one before.
5708000	5711000	And they do. They have the full fucking grocery there. So I went there.
5711000	5714000	So that led to this whole discussion about retail stores that aren't around anymore.
5714000	5718000	We were talking about Montgomery Ward. We're talking about Gemco. I've never heard of Gemco.
5718000	5722000	And best. Are these all California only things I get? Maybe.
5722000	5728000	I think I'd seen the best when it went out of business here because it had the thing that lifted up.
5728000	5734000	Yeah. And now it's our best buy, which I think is funny. Circuit City.
5734000	5737000	Yes. Circuit. Oh, Circuit City did not come up in our discussions.
5737000	5744000	But yes, that is a that is so weird to me because I remember a time when Circuit City was still open and we were doing this show because it was the we launch.
5744000	5748000	Yeah. Circuits. We went over there when they would launch the we over there. Anyway.
5748000	5750000	I bought headphones on the way out of business.
5750000	5755000	Going to our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
5755000	5759000	Act F says best. They still exist. Holy fuck. No, we were talking about we were talking about stores that were gone.
5759000	5766000	They're no longer there. Mervyn's was another one we mentioned. And what was the other clothing store that was gone?
5766000	5772000	Maybe it was Montgomery Ward still. Come on, Noel Gustin chat says, oh, my parents bought my Mac at Montgomery Ward's.
5772000	5777000	And Rama says Computer City. I've never heard of that. That must be a thing. CompUSA. How about that?
5777000	5783000	CompUSA is still around. They were purchased and are along the lines now of Tiger Direct and Newegg.
5783000	5788000	They also do like tutoring computer classes. I think it's still a thing that CompUSA does.
5788000	5792000	But anyway, we're going to take a break. We're going to we're to reminisce a little more after the break.
5792000	5798000	We get to rapid fire news. We're going to get to your phone calls at Orange Lounge Radio.
5798000	5804000	Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype. When we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this break.
5810000	5819000	And welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio. Live tonight, our 680th episode for this March 19th, 2017.
5819000	5825000	That's right. Not only are we going to hit 15 years in a couple of months here, we'll also hit Episode 700 before the end of the year.
5825000	5831000	A lot of a lot of big stuff for OLR going on this year. Thank you guys for joining us for the ride, whether it be for 15 years.
5831000	5837000	Some of you in chat. Shout out, Dark Tetsuya. Or if it's only been, you know, if it's only been 15 minutes.
5837000	5843000	Welcome to your first episode of OLR. Hope you've been having fun. Let's get into some other gaming news.
5843000	5848000	I do want to get to rapid fire news, but I want to talk a little bit about what our announcer Jason brought up at the top of the show.
5848000	5853000	I know he's a big fan of Rocket League, so I'm not surprised that he brought it up there at the top of the show.
5853000	5856000	But, Loki, you've been reading what's going on with Rocket League, right?
5856000	5864000	Yeah, so they're going to be doing an update. It's a new mode coming on March 22nd called Drop Shot, and it's kind of like their take on volleyball.
5864000	5871000	So, unlike the current Rocket League game where it's, you know, you're trying to get into a goal or the net or whatever,
5871000	5877000	you would actually be trying to hit floor panels by destroying them by throwing the ball into the air.
5877000	5888000	So, it's got a new arena called the Core 707, and it's got a bunch of small hexagons in that arena that you destroy to score points.
5888000	5895000	And it says each panel needs two hits to break. So, it's going to have a new record stat, which is called damage.
5895000	5899000	Have you been playing Rocket League online at all?
5899000	5901000	Nope, I have yet to play this game.
5901000	5903000	Oh my god, Loki, it's so fun. You've got to try it.
5903000	5904000	I haven't, I just...
5904000	5909000	Oh, just seriously, take like five seconds, fire it up, and just try it, because a round is quick.
5909000	5912000	It's only going to take you like three minutes, and you don't even have to play real people.
5912000	5917000	Like, I pretty much only play AI. I have done real people. I'll do real people with friends.
5917000	5921000	Like, some of you guys may know Princess Irene. She's been on the show before.
5921000	5926000	Like, I remember playing a few rounds with her before. Like, she would just pull me into these matches that she'd be playing with some of her friends,
5926000	5929000	and we jump in, and it's a lot of fun, Loki. You really should try it.
5929000	5933000	Like, you don't have to invest a lot of time in it, and it's stupid easy to learn, too.
5933000	5939000	So, but, I think all this stuff is cool, even though I don't personally get really involved with the competitiveness,
5939000	5946000	but it is neat to see this little title that I don't, I don't think people thought it was going to go very far,
5946000	5949000	because it was like, what, it was a PlayStation Plus title that was, you know, given away in the beginning,
5949000	5955000	and it's just become like a huge thing in gaming, going on to, what, now it's fourth season, right?
5955000	5959000	So, going in chat for some comments over at live.vognetware.com.
5959000	5962000	S2100matt says, I haven't played Rocket League in a couple months.
5962000	5964000	Actf says, Rocket League is pretty awesome.
5964000	5969000	And Kaijutoan says, so now we have soccer, basketball, hockey, volleyball.
5969000	5971000	Good job, Rocket League.
5971000	5972000	There you go.
5972000	5975000	Dartetsuya says, my brother plays a lot of Rocket League.
5975000	5978000	He made it sound like it's Breakout, this new mode.
5978000	5979000	Oh, that's pretty cool.
5979000	5981000	A little bit of retro stuff.
5981000	5987000	All right, let's get into some rapid fire news and talk about what else has been going on in the gaming industry at a rapid pace. Loki.
5987000	5993000	All right, so, I mean, I haven't really been anticipating it, but it's coming out right around the corner.
5993000	5997000	Super Mario Run's coming to Android next week.
5997000	5999000	So, March 23rd is when it's going to release.
6001000	6003000	Hooray, it'll be...
6003000	6005000	Will you be picking it up?
6005000	6008000	I'll try the demo, I guess.
6008000	6011000	But I'm not all that excited for it.
6011000	6013000	Yeah, maybe my son.
6013000	6016000	I might get that for Josh or something.
6016000	6018000	Because he likes Mario.
6018000	6020000	So, that'll be coming out.
6020000	6022000	They're going to offer the first three levels for free.
6022000	6023000	$10 for the full game.
6023000	6025000	Kind of like it is on iOS.
6025000	6027000	So, look for that.
6027000	6030000	Like we were talking a little bit earlier about backwards compatibility on Xbox One.
6030000	6032000	They're going to be getting some new games as well.
6032000	6035000	So, Street Fighter IV is the major title that's part of this release.
6036000	6041000	Luxor 2, Poker Smash, and Madballs in Babo Evasion.
6041000	6043000	I remember interviewing those guys.
6043000	6045000	Or talking to them over E3.
6045000	6047000	Oh, yeah. I remember that. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
6047000	6049000	So, they're going to be...
6049000	6051000	Those are going to be added to the backwards compatibility list.
6051000	6053000	So, it's...
6053000	6056000	I got to say, I'm just surprised that it's got all this stuff on there.
6056000	6058000	I want to say I think I have...
6058000	6060000	I think I have those.
6060000	6062000	At least a few of those.
6062000	6065000	Yeah, Street Fighter IV, the original I certainly have.
6065000	6067000	But I'm not sure I'd want to go back and play that on Xbox One.
6067000	6073000	Because to be fair, I have like the super uber version on PlayStation 4 I bought on some sale.
6073000	6075000	And I have it on Steam.
6075000	6077000	So, it's kind of like, eh.
6077000	6079000	I don't need the vanilla one.
6079000	6081000	Oh, interesting case.
6081000	6083000	But I know that Poker Smash was like...
6083000	6086000	Wasn't that game kind of like in some way similar to Rocket League?
6086000	6088000	Where it was like this really small little release.
6088000	6090000	And it kind of has a huge cult following.
6090000	6094000	I thought that was that game that like really kind of blew up on Xbox Live.
6094000	6096000	I could be wrong. I don't know.
6096000	6099000	Anyway, let's talk about South by Southwest.
6099000	6101000	That happened recently.
6101000	6103000	I didn't even realize that happened this past week.
6103000	6105000	But that's apparently been going on.
6105000	6107000	It's a music, games, and film festival that was underway this past week.
6107000	6109000	And they had the Video Games Award Show.
6109000	6112000	This is the fourth year of the South by Southwest Video Games Award Show.
6112000	6117000	And the Game of the Year awarded by South by Southwest, Uncharted 4, A Thief's End.
6117000	6119000	That was the big winner there.
6119000	6121000	Some of the other awards, I'm not going to read these all,
6121000	6125000	but some of the other big winners for musical score, Doom by Bethesda.
6125000	6128000	Let's see, Excellence in Multiplayer, Overwatch.
6128000	6132000	Excellence in Convergence, Batman, the Telltale series.
6132000	6136000	Excellence in Gameplay also went to Doom.
6136000	6142000	The Matthew Crump Cultural Innovation Award went to That Dragon Cancer,
6142000	6146000	which, you know, that was a game that came out I think much earlier in 2016
6146000	6149000	that certainly had a very, very strong story to it
6149000	6151000	that affected a lot of people.
6151000	6154000	And the Mobile Game of the Year was? Any guesses?
6154000	6156000	Any guesses? Big mobile game? Almost everybody played it.
6156000	6157000	Pokemon Go?
6157000	6159000	That's right, Pokemon Go was the Mobile Game of the Year.
6159000	6162000	Again, that was the South by Southwest Awards.
6162000	6165000	I think I might have mentioned this a little bit at the top of the show,
6165000	6167000	but just in case, I want to reiterate it now.
6167000	6171000	The Splatoon 2 Global Test Fire is coming up.
6171000	6175000	It's going to start on March 24th and run through March 26th.
6175000	6181000	But keep in mind, there are only six very specific one-hour periods
6181000	6182000	that you can play.
6182000	6185000	As a reminder, it's for one hour beginning at these times.
6185000	6189000	On March 24th, noon, and 8 p.m. Pacific.
6189000	6193000	On March 25th, 4 a.m., noon, and 8 Pacific.
6193000	6197000	On March 26th, 4 a.m. Pacific.
6197000	6199000	So those are the six time frames you can do it.
6199000	6204000	Now, you can download the app or whatever you want to call it on Switch.
6204000	6207000	You can actually download the Test Fire client right now.
6207000	6212000	And I will say this for the Switch, loading games is fast.
6212000	6214000	Like, I downloaded that client pretty fast.
6214000	6218000	I don't know if that's because, again, I'm not having the same Wi-Fi issues
6218000	6220000	it seems a lot of other people are having.
6220000	6223000	But yeah, it was pretty easy to get that installed on the Switch.
6223000	6228000	So my advice before March 24th and the first hour of this,
6228000	6231000	you probably want to get this installed on your thing.
6231000	6233000	And remember, it's free.
6233000	6237000	So don't be butt hurt if it goes up and down during that hour
6237000	6242000	because that is what it's for, is to test and make sure it works.
6242000	6245000	Meanwhile, let's go to Dark Sakura with some more news.
6245000	6249000	There is an emulator that will play Pokemon Yellow.
6249000	6252000	And guess what it's on? The Apple Watch.
6252000	6258000	There is a Game Boy emulator that basically is still under testing.
6258000	6262000	It doesn't have many games available to do on it yet,
6262000	6266000	but they are working on getting Pokemon Yellow to run well.
6266000	6268000	And the emulator is called Giovanni.
6268000	6271000	Of course, now it's not anything official,
6271000	6274000	but it looks kind of neat to see it in motion.
6274000	6279000	I mean, other people have tried to bring Doom over,
6279000	6282000	which I don't know how that would work, but whatever.
6283000	6292000	And then, in other news, Rock Band 4 is going to be getting some crossovers.
6292000	6296000	We will be getting some with Mass Effect and Archer.
6296000	6307000	So basically, Sterling Archer is going to be a character model for Rock Band 4.
6307000	6309000	Nice.
6309000	6315000	And then there's also some Mass Effect Andromeda-themed outfits,
6315000	6319000	including a Normandy base and N7 armor.
6319000	6321000	That sounds ridiculous.
6321000	6324000	That does sound ridiculous. Sign me up.
6324000	6325000	That's it.
6325000	6330000	Alright, let's travel around and check out what's coming out in stores at retail this week.
6330000	6332000	The important thing to mention about that last story, though,
6332000	6336000	is that they're releasing the song or Kenny Loggins' Danger Zone.
6336000	6338000	They go along with the Sterling Archer.
6338000	6340000	Ah, Jesus.
6340000	6343000	How is that not already there?
6343000	6345000	That's news, too.
6345000	6347000	How is that not already there?
6347000	6349000	Alright, that's cool, though.
6349000	6354000	Anyways, so this week we've got Mass Effect Andromeda coming out on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.
6354000	6356000	Eeeee!
6356000	6361000	Tokidin 2 on PC, PlayStation 4, and Levita.
6361000	6365000	Troll NI on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.
6365000	6368000	There's a lot of people on the internet that can relate to that.
6368000	6370000	Yep.
6370000	6375000	And then Dreamfall Chapters, the longest journey on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
6375000	6379000	A 3DS game, Mario Sports Superstars on 3DS.
6379000	6386000	And last but not least, Zero Escape, the Nonary games on PC, PlayStation 4, and Vita.
6386000	6389000	Alright, let's go to Japan. Hi, Japan.
6389000	6394000	Let me butcher some pronunciations for you of your releases coming up on March 23rd on the PlayStation 4.
6394000	6397000	Deus Ex, Mankind Divided, released in Japan.
6397000	6403000	Also on March 23rd, Eagle Flight and Farming Simulator 17 are released.
6403000	6409000	WRC 6 Fia World Rally Championship, and Gen'Dai Daisen Ryaku comes out.
6409000	6413000	Oh, excuse me, 2017, specifically, comes out this week.
6413000	6418000	That is one of those airplane-type games, which it looks like it's half a mix between one of those
6418000	6423000	those, uh, strategical games, like in Advance War, mixed with plane fighting type of thing.
6423000	6428000	So, because I think those types of, like, Ace Combat games tend to do a little better overseas.
6428000	6432000	Not that they don't do well here, but they do really well overseas, I believe.
6432000	6438000	Uh, in Japan this week, you can look forward to Tokaiden 2, Hatsuyuki Sakura in regular and limited edition,
6438000	6446000	Sidekicks, and Biohazard Revelations 2 gets a price reduction as it moves into the best series on the Vita.
6446000	6449000	And, let me see if they have anything listed for retail on the Switch.
6449000	6455000	No, nothing on retail for the Switch this week, which, you know, is kind of the same thing here.
6455000	6458000	Uh, we're just getting our stuff on the online digital stuff.
6458000	6466000	So, uh, the 3DS, however, uh, not seeing their Mario Sports Superstars until March 30th,
6466000	6468000	so you're gonna have to wait another week for that.
6468000	6470000	And, of course, the matching Amiibo cards.
6470000	6473000	So, in the meanwhile, we'll have to move over to the UK.
6474000	6475000	Uh-oh.
6475000	6476000	I'd like to, I'd like to move there.
6476000	6477000	Yes, yes.
6477000	6478000	For wheels.
6478000	6485000	Um, on the 23rd, we have Bye Bye Box Boy for 3DS and Mass Effect Andromeda, yay!
6485000	6496000	On the 24th, Dreamfall Chapters for several systems, uh, Tokaiden 2 for PC, PlayStation Vita, and for PlayStation 4.
6496000	6497000	That's it.
6497000	6498000	Alright.
6498000	6502000	Well, we're about to go back to Dark Sakura, because every week you guys send us emails.
6503000	6507000	Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to send us emails.
6507000	6514000	And, of course, Dark Sakura always prepares in advance by opening up the email bag earlier before the show even starts
6514000	6518000	to find the emails that she's gonna be reading for you tonight.
6518000	6521000	To find nothing, you think?
6521000	6522000	Parts, nice.
6522000	6523000	Oh, there's some stuff.
6523000	6526000	I was like, I thought I saw one from our favorite emailer.
6526000	6527000	Okay.
6527000	6528000	Um, this-
6528000	6530000	One of our fa- I don't play favorites, sorry.
6530000	6531000	Hey.
6531000	6532000	Reedon.
6532000	6533000	Sorry.
6533000	6537000	I just received a Kindle Fire tablet that I was gifted from Valentine's Day.
6537000	6541000	Only real complaints were that the touchscreen isn't as sensitive as it probably should be.
6541000	6545000	The volume is pretty low, plus there's a lot of Android apps not on the App Store.
6545000	6550000	Among the apps I checked out to download was the Twitch app, and I realized, of course, it is on the Fire.
6550000	6558000	What I usually watch on Twitch is the Salty Bet feed, even though I don't have an account to gamble virtual currency.
6558000	6563000	I have tried joining Jackbox games that streamers didn't have locked down to subscribers.
6563000	6567000	Fun, although the ten second delay made some of the games tough to play.
6567000	6575000	Also, as far as YouTube LPs, or I guess long plays, I have been watching Game Grumps Ross's wife, Commander Holly, playing Night in the Woods.
6575000	6580000	I stopped watching only because I really want to play that myself, assuming my 2009 MacBook could run it.
6580000	6581000	Upgrade.
6581000	6582000	It's time to upgrade.
6582000	6590000	Mostly I'm still watching the custom Super Mario World roms and indie games played by Rail Cow, I guess.
6590000	6592000	That comes from Robert M.
6594000	6597000	Alright, awesome. I don't think I picked up a question in there.
6597000	6598000	It's just an email.
6598000	6600000	But thank you for the update.
6600000	6602000	Alright. Hello, LR.
6604000	6606000	Just a few thoughts on last week's very busy episode.
6607000	6613000	On the subject of Switch's forthcoming video streaming apps, we learned the importance of first impressions with Street Fighter V.
6613000	6617000	Yes, many features and improvements have been added since the game released 13 months ago.
6617000	6621000	But the folks that looked at version 1.0 and said, nope, did not all come around.
6621000	6624000	Most of them came, saw, and left.
6624000	6626000	Onto the Switch.
6626000	6631000	Already on Amazon.com, multiple people have asked, does it play Netflix?
6631000	6634000	And of course, the answers all say no.
6634000	6639000	Once the public understands that it does not play Netflix, how will they later be convinced that it does?
6639000	6643000	Generally, the word of mouth on device happens when the device comes out.
6643000	6647000	This might happen a second time around the holidays, but that is in no way assured.
6647000	6653000	I'm not sure Nintendo will be able to convince the public at large that it plays Netflix later, even if it actually does.
6653000	6655000	I hope I'm wrong, though.
6656000	6661000	Robby pointed out that with Switch, it's easy to bring a game to a friend's house.
6661000	6666000	I will point out that if you use an external hard drive on Xbox One, it was already very easy to do that.
6666000	6669000	Except you can do it with digital games as well.
6669000	6676000	Simply plug in your external drive with installed games into a friend's Xbox One, then sign into their console.
6676000	6680000	Give it a few minutes to index what's on the drive and you'll be able to play everything on it with no hassle.
6680000	6684000	You can even use your own save file because your cloud save will follow you there.
6684000	6689000	Honestly, I feel that this is currently the overall most user friendly solution across all platforms.
6689000	6693000	I really don't have anything else to say, so I will challenge you to say this seven times fast.
6693000	6696000	Sally sells six switches, Sally sells six switches, whatever.
6696000	6699000	Now I'm running away. Well, I also have throat problems.
6699000	6702000	And that comes from YYR.
6702000	6707000	Hi, YYR. I did not know that about the Xbox One. That's pretty cool.
6707000	6710000	But you did have to use the word if, and it's for a good reason.
6710000	6714000	It's not something that's kind of like natively a part of the console.
6714000	6716000	I mean, it is and it isn't. You know what I mean?
6716000	6720000	Like, you have to have this external hard drive and you have to put your files on it.
6720000	6724000	It's not quite the same thing, although I will give you certainly the props.
6724000	6730000	It is an additional feature that I certainly wasn't aware of before, so there you go.
6730000	6733000	Bobby Blackwolf in chat over at live.fognetwork.com says,
6733000	6736000	The Wii didn't play Netflix when it first came out either.
6736000	6739000	Neither did the Xbox or PlayStation 3.
6739000	6743000	To be fair, though, the landscape ten years ago, we lived in a world before House of Cards
6743000	6748000	and before Orange is the New Black, which those shows really transformed Netflix into something different.
6748000	6751000	The landscape is different now than it was then.
6751000	6756000	I still kind of stand by what I said about the Netflix stuff.
6756000	6758000	I think it's something that will be important.
6758000	6764000	I'm not so sure that I totally agree with what you're saying here, YYR,
6764000	6772000	because Nintendo is kind of different in the fact that they can get Reggie Fils-Aime booked on any talk show that they want.
6772000	6776000	I mean, he was just on CBS This Morning in some clip.
6776000	6780000	They get him on The Tonight Show all the time, and if they want to try to get a different thing out there
6780000	6784000	and get him to show Netflix on these consoles and stuff, they'll do it.
6784000	6791000	So I just feel like they can kind of control the conversation a little better than some other people can.
6791000	6793000	So I don't know.
6793000	6799000	I sort of think around the holidays they're really going to push that narrative with whatever happens.
6799000	6805000	I think the Switch is going to look a lot different around the holiday than it does right now.
6805000	6813000	But I will also say the longer I'm kind of having my Switch and using it, I'm really liking it a lot more just as a console.
6813000	6819000	I'm really liking this whole handheld TV thing a lot more than I originally thought I would.
6819000	6823000	The longer I'm with it, the more I'm really into it, especially as more games are coming out that aren't just Zelda.
6823000	6825000	So pretty cool.
6825000	6829000	I'm still, you know, I don't think it's perfect, and there's still a lot of things that bug me about it.
6829000	6834000	The $70 Pro Controller being one of them, but damn, it is a nice controller.
6834000	6837000	Anyway, thanks for the email. Nonetheless, YYR.
6837000	6840000	That was it for emails tonight, right?
6840000	6841000	That was all.
6841000	6846000	All right. Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you wish to send us an email in the future.
6846000	6848000	Here we go.
6848000	6853000	I want to say before we get back to news, because Bobby's bringing this up as well and it's worth responding to.
6853000	6860000	I love that 10 years ago we all bitched about how our game consoles being less about games and more about media devices,
6860000	6867000	and now we're bitching about our game consoles are too much about games and not spending enough time talking about TV and sports.
6867000	6870000	Here's the thing.
6870000	6875000	I'm not approaching this necessarily as a gamer.
6875000	6879000	I always use this analogy all the stinkin' time with Nintendo.
6879000	6883000	If y'all haven't seen the YouTube clip by now, what's stopping you?
6883000	6891000	You need to go look up Tyra Banks yells at contestant when she was on America's Next Top Model going,
6891000	6895000	We were rooting for you! We were all rooting for you! How dare you!
6895000	6897000	And all this stuff.
6897000	6900000	The reason why, and this is me in particular, and I don't know if Bobby directed that comment to me.
6900000	6907000	He might not have, but I still want to just say from my perspective why I do think Nintendo should put Netflix on this thing,
6907000	6910000	even though yes I am a gamer first and all this stuff,
6910000	6916000	is that I also realize Nintendo is able to reach an audience of a lot of different type of people because they did it with the Wii,
6916000	6921000	and they reached that soccer mom audience, and they reached a larger audience of people that weren't just gamers.
6921000	6928000	And the way that they can do that is through some of these apps and things that maybe we as gamers don't necessarily like.
6928000	6934000	But it's like this whole fact that you can do Netflix on TV or on the device,
6934000	6939000	pick it up, take it with you, pick up from where you left off because Netflix will let you download your shows now,
6939000	6942000	depending on what show it is and all this stuff.
6942000	6947000	It's one of those things where it's more a missed opportunity to sell the system further.
6947000	6949000	And that's what it is for me.
6949000	6953000	Especially, I would think that you would want to put a lot of the tablet features that they have out there,
6953000	6960000	like different apps and things, for those people that may not necessarily game all the time or more casual gamers.
6960000	6966000	I would say you can even go as far as putting books on there.
6966000	6971000	Because it has a tablet, use it for reading books.
6971000	6975000	I mean, I wouldn't use a tablet for that, but it's something that people could use it for.
6975000	6979000	Or streaming media or a lot of different things.
6979000	6982000	I mean, I think why cut yourself short?
6983000	6990000	Someone develops the app for it, say Barnes and Noble or whatever wants to develop their stupid Nook app for it.
6990000	6993000	Who gives a shit? So what if no one downloads it?
6993000	6999000	Oh my God, I would be so happy if they did a TuneIn app on that thing so people could listen to Vogue and Network.
6999000	7004000	Granted, there's no cellular networks, they couldn't do it on the go unless there's Wi-Fi, but still it would be pretty cool.
7004000	7008000	Yeah, I mean, who cares? If people don't utilize it, no big deal.
7008000	7011000	But at least it's there for the people who do want to utilize it.
7011000	7015000	So yes, I'm going to ask, as a gamer, I'm going to ask, where are the games?
7015000	7020000	And we're seeing Nintendo answer that a little bit, to be fair to Nintendo.
7020000	7028000	Even though that first week it looked a little dicey, the two weeks that have followed up, at least online, have been pretty strong.
7028000	7031000	Especially compared to Wii U, especially compared to Wii U.
7031000	7034000	So I do feel like Nintendo's making improvements there, awesome.
7034000	7048000	I think this other thing, this Netflix thing and some of the things that Loki's bringing up there, could really transform this this holiday into these talking pieces that are going to get more non-gamers or casual gamers invested in the system.
7048000	7053000	And then that's a win-win for all of us because now third parties are going to want to come back to Nintendo.
7053000	7061000	But as somebody in chat pointed out over at live.vognetwork.com, who said this here? Somebody had said that the system's selling anyway.
7061000	7067000	So it seems to be doing well right now. And yeah, so the system is doing pretty well right now.
7067000	7078000	So it's based on the sales numbers earlier. So maybe Nintendo doesn't need my stinking advice, but I do feel like those things are going to be there by year's end.
7078000	7081000	But that's the whole reason we did the time capsule. We'll find out.
7081000	7088000	Alright, let's get back into some other news. We want to get into what Loki was going to talk about here.
7088000	7098000	Yeah, so the PlayStation blog announced that Drawn to Death is going to be coming to the PlayStation 4 April 4th.
7098000	7102000	And what's kind of cool is it will be free for PlayStation Plus subscribers.
7102000	7110000	So this is, if you're not familiar with it, it is the new game by David Jeff, who did like the Twisted Metal series.
7110000	7116000	And it's kind of a third-person, over-the-top third-person shooter that exists in a notebook.
7116000	7120000	So it looks like sketches done by a high school student or something like that.
7120000	7125000	So it looks cool. And the fact they get to play it for free is another bonus.
7125000	7135000	They haven't really announced yet what additional games are going to be coming out for April's, you know, games of the PlayStation Plus stuff.
7135000	7138000	But at least we know one of them.
7138000	7145000	There you go. I'm excited to check this out. That trailer looked neat, so I'm curious to see.
7145000	7147000	You know, free is a great price.
7147000	7155000	And as we were just talking about at the top of the segment with Rocket League, did very well for itself as a free game originally, and now is everywhere.
7155000	7158000	Maybe this game will do very well for itself as well.
7158000	7165000	All right. Hey, do you remember, this was probably almost a year ago at this point, maybe longer, that we were talking about this.
7165000	7169000	Primal Rage had a canceled sequel. You guys remember that?
7169000	7176000	Now obviously the canceled sequel is old. I remember talking about this, that it was unearthed or something relatively recently.
7176000	7181000	So Atari was going to do a sequel to Primal Rage, which was the dinosaur fighting game. Remember that?
7181000	7187000	And that was when Jurassic Park was first out. So this was the type of shit that people wanted.
7187000	7192000	It was dinosaurs beating each other up, right? And then what, Turok was around that same time too, right?
7192000	7200000	Well, Killer Instinct, I mean, that's kind of almost like a, I don't know if that came up before or after, but was it sort of like a claymation-ish game?
7200000	7201000	Clay Fighters.
7201000	7208000	Well, Clay Fighters was that, but the animation that was in this game, wasn't it claymation or did they do like CG rendered to like sprites?
7208000	7217000	I think it was like CG rendered sprite type of things. So, but anyway, Atari was working on a sequel that was going to be released in 96, but it was shelved around 1995.
7217000	7219000	They didn't actually end up releasing it.
7219000	7229000	However, get this, it is now out there available to play in an emulator. There's still some buggy stuff in the game. It's not going to be perfect because the game was never actually released.
7229000	7232000	I think that you can only play one round before you have to restart the whole thing.
7232000	7239000	Yeah, but you can, you can still check that out. It was, by the way, it was, it was stop motion fighting is what they did.
7239000	7243000	Okay, stop motion. Yeah, it did definitely have a look to it.
7243000	7253000	So, uh, pretty cool. You can check that out. There's a whole emulator available on a Weebly site. You could probably just Google for Primal Rage 2 and find that if you would like to give it a try.
7253000	7261000	I'm sure that they'll have a running in, well, it probably already runs in MAME. I'm curious to see if they can fix some of the bugs in it.
7261000	7276000	Yeah, same. Uh, it's kind of like, um, God, what was that game? There was some game that was released really recently where the guy, it was like the only copy of it out there, but the guy went in to try to fix some things and everybody was like, no, you need to put it out. Remember that? Remember that?
7276000	7283000	Yeah. Well, I mean, now the pure game is out there. Primal Rage 2, the pure game is out there. So now try to fix it, Internet.
7283000	7286000	Or at least now fix it so that it doesn't crash after each level.
7286000	7287000	Yeah.
7288000	7293000	I mean, that, that's kind of just functionality. I, I don't see a problem in fixing that type of thing.
7293000	7299000	All right. Just a few more stories for you guys. We're going to open up the Skype line, but first we're gonna hear from Dark Sakura.
7299000	7301000	Yeah, do I gotta?
7301000	7305000	I guess you don't have to. It's a volunteer show.
7305000	7319000	Seriously. Um, and this one is, it just pisses me off so much because I would have hoped that the gamergate people would have learned that we don't care what they think and want them to shut up.
7321000	7325000	I'm, I'm just shocked that term is still out there all this time later.
7325000	7327000	Right? It's fucking stupid.
7327000	7336000	Dear men, women are not out to oppress you. You've been in charge for the last few million years. You know, shut up.
7336000	7338000	So what's happening this time?
7338000	7353000	Well, now there's an online harassment campaign that's been directed at a former EA employee who is blaming her for the animation problem in Mass Effect Andromeda.
7353000	7358000	And so basically Bioware put out a statement, actually Aaron Flynn put out a statement and I'll just read it.
7358000	7366000	Recently, a former EA employee was misidentified as a lead member of the Mass Effect Andromeda development team. Those reports are false.
7366000	7375000	We respect the opinions of our players and community and welcome feedback on our games, but attacking individuals regardless of their involvement in the project is never acceptable.
7375000	7378000	Good on EA for making a statement like that, to be honest.
7378000	7389000	That's from Aaron Flynn, the Bioware GM. So it's basically, um, they just need to shut up really.
7389000	7397000	And it turns out that she was a writer or she, she was not as involved as people were pigging her out to be, right?
7397000	7402000	Like she was a part of a team of people, if I'm not mistaken. Am I right?
7402000	7410000	Yeah. A former, uh, it looks like she had been a former facial animator, but she's, she wasn't with the company and didn't work on Mass Effect Andromeda.
7410000	7413000	It just basically people...
7413000	7421000	In general, it's, I'm going to make a broad generalization here, but I'm going to do it with purpose. Mob mentality needs to fucking stop.
7421000	7424000	It does. And the internet makes it so easy.
7424000	7425000	It does.
7425000	7433000	People need to break away from this hive mind of hate.
7433000	7441000	This is, this is literally the modern version. I don't, I don't even have to say a particular group's name or anything like that.
7441000	7447000	This is literally the modern version of she's a witch. Burn the witch.
7447000	7448000	Yeah, it is.
7448000	7450000	Think about it. Think about it.
7450000	7451000	It's hysteria.
7451000	7458000	When you read that shit in the history books, don't you go, wow, those people were fucking nuts.
7458000	7459000	Think about it.
7459000	7462000	It's, it's hysteria for the sake of hysteria.
7462000	7466000	You know, fueled by unfounded fear is really what it is.
7466000	7478000	It's people letting their own fear, their own insecurities and their own prejudices running wild and sucking other people into their vacuum of stupid.
7478000	7482000	And Kaijuto in chat says, even if she did work on it, she shouldn't be attacked.
7482000	7486000	Yes. Very good point that I should have also made sure to say.
7486000	7487000	So very good point.
7487000	7498000	Even if she, even, even if she like single handedly wrote the game from start to finish herself, like, go, go do something positive with your life for God's sake.
7498000	7500000	Go do something.
7500000	7502000	Go, go help a charity.
7502000	7504000	Go volunteer for something you do believe in.
7504000	7506000	Don't, don't attack this person.
7506000	7507000	Or how about this?
7507000	7508000	Over a game.
7508000	7509000	How about this?
7509000	7510000	Stop.
7510000	7511000	Just stop.
7511000	7515000	If you're going to say something hateful, stop.
7515000	7517000	No one cares what you think.
7517000	7521000	Do y'all send shit to Adam Sandler for the movies?
7521000	7524000	Do y'all do this to Rob?
7524000	7527000	Do y'all do this to David Spade?
7527000	7531000	Well, she turned me into a newt.
7531000	7533000	A newt?
7534000	7537000	I got better.
7537000	7540000	So she weighs the same as a duck.
7540000	7542000	She's made of wood.
7542000	7545000	And therefore, a witch.
7545000	7552000	No, I, I just think that, I think we need to stop paying attention to these fuckers.
7552000	7553000	I mean, seriously.
7553000	7558000	Well, you brought them up, Dark Sakura, maybe you shouldn't have.
7558000	7562000	I brought it up because it has to do with Mass Effect.
7562000	7567000	To be fair, is it gamer gay people or is it people just flipping out because they have
7567000	7569000	shit they don't like, like they did with the Jim Sterling article?
7569000	7571000	It's some people who have been associated with gamer.
7571000	7573000	I'm going to back up.
7573000	7577000	I don't give a fuck who they are or what they call themselves.
7577000	7581000	They're being a mob and the angry mob needs to fucking stop.
7581000	7583000	I don't care what the label is.
7583000	7586000	If you're participating in this, stop.
7586000	7590000	Sometimes it has to be addressed to tell them off.
7590000	7593000	It just, it's a whole group of people.
7593000	7597000	You know, I was going back to people not thinking for themselves or being weak willed.
7597000	7599000	This is fucking weak willed bullshit.
7599000	7604000	This is one person says something and other people are using this person to enable them.
7604000	7607000	Hello, American election system.
7607000	7614000	You know, it's people is the one person who will be vocal about the bullshit that assholes think about.
7614000	7618000	And they all rally to the head asshole.
7618000	7622000	So anyway, if you're going to, if you're going to accuse somebody of being a witch,
7622000	7624000	you better bring the receipt that she turns you into a newt.
7624000	7626000	You better have some proof.
7626000	7628000	Let's see some warts.
7628000	7631000	All right. Moving on. A couple more stories for you guys. Loki.
7631000	7637000	So Telltale's CEO, Kevin Brunner has stepped down.
7637000	7643000	So apparently he's been with the company since 2015.
7644000	7652000	And, you know, oversaw development of the Minecraft story mode, The Walking Dead, and the Batman Telltale series.
7652000	7658000	Of course, now that he has stepped down, it looks like the former founder or the co-founder,
7658000	7664000	who was the CEO role before Dan Conners, is going to be taking the place of him.
7667000	7668000	Interesting.
7668000	7673000	Yeah. Very interesting what this could mean for the future direction of the company or what have you.
7673000	7678000	But they seem to have cut themselves out a little bit of a niche for themselves with the storytelling games.
7678000	7681000	And, you know, a lot of them do very well. The Walking Dead stuff.
7681000	7684000	Looking for the Guardians of the Galaxy game is supposed to come down.
7684000	7687000	I still need to play that Batman one. I really, really wanted to play that.
7687000	7694000	I just, it's one of those games that just got lost to the something shiny is out to play.
7694000	7696000	Yes, it is. That is very true.
7696000	7701000	Alright. And lastly, but not leastly tonight, get this.
7701000	7708000	So, we like to bitch about how there's download content that is actually pay-to-unlock content,
7708000	7710000	because it's stored on the disc.
7710000	7715000	In fact, checking back to that story about Street Fighter IV on Xbox One,
7715000	7718000	wasn't Street Fighter IV one of those first games that had that?
7718000	7720000	Like, some of those characters were actually on the disc?
7720000	7722000	I thought that was the thing.
7722000	7728000	I remember if it was Street Fighter IV, I know that, like, Marvel vs. Capcom 3 had that stuff on there.
7728000	7733000	Maybe it was Street Fighter IV. I know Dead Rising was one of them, I thought.
7733000	7740000	Well, what we thought started with, oh, say, the Xbox 360, may have actually been in place a little bit earlier.
7740000	7744000	There was a game called Flosian Brothers. I don't even know how to pronounce this.
7744000	7748000	Flosian Brothers. Do you know this game? It was a Dreamcast game, developed by Visual Concepts.
7749000	7757000	They now do work on 2K games titles, but Flosian Brothers was released in 2001, and it had Episode 1 in its title.
7757000	7761000	So, it was supposed to come out with more episodes later, but then the Dreamcast kind of...
7761000	7763000	I thought it was Phloygen.
7763000	7765000	Maybe that's it. Maybe it's Phloygen.
7765000	7767000	Yeah, it wasn't, like, that great of a game.
7767000	7772000	Well, maybe that's why it never got past Episode 1, that and the fact that the Dreamcast ended up folding up.
7772000	7773000	It had Frank Welker in it.
7773000	7775000	Did it? Oh, cool.
7775000	7782000	So, anyway, apparently, there was going to be download content for the first 12 months of the first episode.
7782000	7789000	Well, get this. The developers behind the game went back into an on-disk security measure they had,
7789000	7795000	and so they've actually released those 12 pieces of DLC on a place called Dreamcast Live,
7795000	7800000	so you can put the files on a Dreamcast VMU and play them in the original game.
7800000	7805000	In other words, these additional 12 steps were on the disk already.
7805000	7807000	They were just, like, encrypted or something.
7807000	7813000	They were locked away, and now the key is out there all these years later since they never were able to be released.
7813000	7819000	So, if you want to check that out, you can check out dreamcastlive.net if you happen to own this game.
7819000	7822000	But, again, this is one... I have to admit, I never heard of this,
7822000	7828000	but this also came out in that, like, four-year period where I really wasn't playing a lot of video games, to be fair,
7828000	7835000	before I kind of got back into gaming when I picked up a Dreamcast and a GameCube and all that stuff way after the fact.
7835000	7840000	So, anyway, that's going to do it for our news tonight,
7840000	7845000	but we're going to open up the Skype line at OrangeLoungeRadio, all one word on Skype.
7845000	7850000	If you'd like to give us a call, again, that's OrangeLoungeRadio, all one word on Skype.
7850000	7853000	Let me check in with some last-minute stories you guys might have.
7853000	7856000	DarkSakura? Loki? Anything you guys want to talk about?
7856000	7860000	Oh, actually, hold that thought, because we've got a call coming in right now.
7860000	7862000	Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?
7862000	7864000	Hey, everyone, it's Ronbo.
7864000	7866000	Hey, buddy, how you doing?
7866000	7867000	Old.
7867000	7869000	You're old?
7869000	7871000	Yes, Rob, I'm old.
7871000	7873000	Well, I know that.
7873000	7879000	Yes, but due to some of the stuff you talked about tonight, you made me feel old.
7879000	7881000	Uh-oh.
7881000	7884000	What did I say, Rama?
7884000	7892000	Okay, first whole topic about stores that we used to go to as a kid.
7892000	7896000	Okay, because there was a chain of stores around here called Kaldor's,
7896000	7901000	and it was the Kohl's of its time, and I used to shop there all the time,
7901000	7905000	but they're no longer there, and I used to buy my games from there.
7905000	7908000	You probably remember another one called Consumers as well.
7908000	7910000	We didn't have them out here.
7910000	7912000	We had Woolworth's.
7912000	7916000	Yeah, Woolworth's. Aren't they still around, but overseas?
7916000	7917000	Not in the U.S.
7917000	7918000	Yeah, overseas.
7918000	7920000	It'll thrill you, yes. I asked them to.
7920000	7923000	Yeah. No, and there's restaurants.
7923000	7928000	I was just thinking Howard Johnson's was a chain of restaurants before it was a hotel, right?
7928000	7931000	And now there's one left in America somewhere?
7931000	7934000	I think there's still one somewhere around here somewhere.
7934000	7937000	I don't remember, but I think there is.
7938000	7941000	Act Efton Chat says, I miss KB Toys.
7941000	7944000	Yeah, I remember KB Toys.
7944000	7949000	We got these little Toys R Us Express locations, but they're not the same.
7949000	7950000	No, they're not the same.
7950000	7953000	Yeah, those kind of replaced a lot of the KB's around here too,
7953000	7956000	although Toys R Us I think has been doing pretty well,
7956000	7962000	but a lot of these big retail stores are really struggling in the era of online,
7962000	7967000	and Amazon is really killing a lot of people when it comes to the online stuff,
7967000	7971000	and I really think the next big one that's going to bite the dust
7971000	7974000	is sadly going to be Sears and K-Mart.
7974000	7978000	I mean, every year you hear something about how they're cutting back stores
7978000	7979000	and things are changing.
7979000	7983000	I mean, I'm kind of surprised there's any K-Marts left open at this point, to be honest.
7983000	7988000	Oh, it ain't K-Mart, but it's Radio Shack.
7988000	7989000	Oh, yeah.
7990000	7992000	We were like, are we not surprised?
7992000	7994000	I think everyone had their watch.
7994000	7997000	We're like, yeah, I called this, so let me collect on this bet here, you know?
7997000	8002000	Yeah, well, Radio Shack was trying to carve a niche.
8002000	8005000	It's the whole cell phone thing, which seemed to be the logical direction for them,
8005000	8008000	but I guess it wasn't enough.
8010000	8013000	Pretty much, but here's the reason why I called.
8013000	8016000	Now, top of the show, you were talking about game reviews and stuff,
8017000	8021000	and I've always said that I'm the average gamer.
8021000	8024000	I like what I like, you like what you like.
8024000	8029000	I pick my games based off what you like, you like, and you like.
8029000	8033000	Now, I've got friends who have pretty much, on my Facebook,
8033000	8037000	have ripped Breath of the Wild apart as pretty much a shit game,
8037000	8041000	anywhere from storyline to graphics.
8041000	8045000	Now, from part of the storyline I picked up, I find it interesting.
8045000	8048000	I'm not too big on the graphics, but that's just me.
8048000	8052000	But I will say, because of everybody talking about it,
8052000	8058000	I decided to play Ocarina of Time because I picked it up for 3DS.
8060000	8064000	And I'm still in the boat of, I do not like the 3D Zelda games.
8064000	8067000	I'm playing them just to say that I have played them.
8067000	8071000	Well, in my opinion, Rama, here's the problem.
8071000	8074000	I am not a big fan of the 3D Zelda games either,
8074000	8078000	but I think Breath of the Wild and Ocarina of Time can't be compared.
8078000	8081000	I really don't think those two games are hardly the same thing
8081000	8086000	because I feel like Ocarina of Time came from a different era of development
8086000	8090000	that does share a lot with, yes, Twilight Princess, even Skyward Sword,
8090000	8094000	but I really feel like Breath of the Wild comes from a different,
8094000	8097000	like we're entering this newer era of development within Nintendo
8097000	8100000	where you can see the influence of things like,
8100000	8103000	as we checked at the top of the show,
8103000	8106000	things like Dark Souls was what I was getting to,
8106000	8109000	and Skyrim and things like that.
8109000	8115000	So I think for that reason, there's more to this new era of 3D Zeldas
8115000	8118000	than just the fact that it's 3D.
8118000	8122000	Yeah, I mean, I get it.
8122000	8127000	The new 3D game is pulling elements from other games to make it work,
8127000	8128000	and I'm okay with that.
8128000	8131000	But I was reading a review about how you pick up weapons in the game
8131000	8133000	after two or three hits they're destroying.
8133000	8135000	I'm like, you know what?
8135000	8137000	I don't know if I could deal with the game like that,
8137000	8139000	whether it's Zelda or not, you know?
8139000	8143000	And it's the most controversial part of the game's design.
8143000	8145000	I'll leave it at that for now.
8145000	8147000	But I have to say this.
8147000	8149000	I have to say this.
8149000	8154000	For someone to call this new Zelda a shit game,
8154000	8158000	that's a little bit sensationalistic to me.
8158000	8161000	Now, hey, everybody's welcome to their opinion,
8161000	8164000	and if they truly believe in their heart of hearts that it's a shit game,
8164000	8166000	then so be it.
8166000	8170000	Them and I have a completely different taste in gaming.
8170000	8172000	But it is going to make me go in the future
8172000	8174000	when that person says something about a different video game,
8174000	8176000	I'm going to be like,
8176000	8179000	isn't this the same person that called Zelda a shit game?
8179000	8181000	I have done that.
8181000	8184000	I've had friends say this game is shit, but they praise this.
8184000	8188000	I'm just like, well, you know, how do you say this and that?
8188000	8191000	We get our friendly banter back and forth.
8191000	8195000	Like I said, everybody is welcome to their opinion.
8195000	8200000	But to call it a shit game, I mean, a 7 out of 10 even,
8200000	8204000	at least I kind of go, okay, sure, different strokes for different folks.
8204000	8206000	The durability thing is kind of frustrating.
8206000	8210000	Yeah, I could see where somebody probably ended up giving it a 7 out of 10.
8210000	8213000	That's not what I would have given it, but okay.
8213000	8218000	But a shit game, it's a stretch.
8218000	8220000	Again, they're welcome to that opinion,
8220000	8226000	but I probably won't be using that opinion on their other gaming habits
8226000	8228000	to make my decisions, if that makes sense.
8228000	8230000	Fair enough.
8230000	8233000	All right, well, Rama, anything else you want to get out before I let you go?
8233000	8237000	I want to agree with something that Loki has said about
8237000	8239000	how Nintendo makes money left and right.
8239000	8241000	Let me tell you.
8241000	8246000	You still get Ocarina of Time for 40 bucks for 3DS,
8246000	8252000	and you can also get the Nintendo Selects version for $20.
8252000	8257000	I just think that's one of the most amazing scams Nintendo has ever come up with.
8257000	8262000	And can't you get the Virtual Console version for 10 bucks on Wii?
8262000	8264000	I don't have a Wii.
8264000	8266000	Well, now you have an emulator. You can check.
8266000	8269000	Maybe, but I'm just saying.
8269000	8271000	I'm like, I'm going to pick up the Selects version.
8271000	8274000	I go pick it up. I see right next to it the original version for $40,
8274000	8277000	and I'm just like, nah, Nintendo.
8277000	8279000	You're not getting my full 40.
8279000	8281000	That ain't happening. Not today.
8281000	8283000	Not this time. Not today, Satan. Not today.
8283000	8286000	Exactly, my dude. Exactly.
8286000	8289000	All right. My friend, I'm going to let you go to try to squeeze in a couple more calls,
8289000	8290000	but thanks for calling.
8290000	8292000	Well, let's try again, man. Thanks a lot, man.
8292000	8293000	Take care. Bye.
8293000	8294000	Yeah, bye.
8294000	8297000	Let's see. TigerColladChat over at live.vognetwork.com says,
8297000	8300000	If someone called Sky's favorite game a shit game, the claws will come out.
8300000	8303000	Hey, what did the guy before us say about Mass Effect, huh?
8303000	8306000	I know he doesn't call it that.
8306000	8310000	And as I said, different people are into different types of things,
8310000	8313000	and not everybody's going to be into Mass Effect, and that's okay.
8313000	8316000	Shit, I didn't get Mass Effect at first.
8316000	8319000	I had to approach it kind of with a different perspective,
8319000	8325000	and even my own evolutions as a gamer from 2007 when that series first came out
8325000	8330000	to, what was it, probably 2012 or, God, the years just all fucking blurred together at some point,
8330000	8334000	2012 when I finally did approach the series and give it another go, you know what I mean?
8334000	8336000	So, yeah.
8336000	8341000	ActAftonChat says, Black Wolf doesn't call it shit. He calls it crap.
8341000	8343000	Remember, it's a family show. Yes.
8343000	8345000	I'm teasing him. I'm teasing him.
8345000	8351000	But, you know, there's probably games that he's into that I'm not as into, and that's okay.
8351000	8357000	If everybody had the exact same opinion all the time, the world would probably be a little bit more boring.
8357000	8361000	Any last minute stories we want to get to? Loki?
8361000	8363000	No?
8363000	8367000	Wow. All right. I guess it was a little bit slower of a news week.
8367000	8372000	Now that the new console launched, E3 is still a couple months away.
8372000	8375000	Are there still tickets available for E3?
8375000	8380000	They were still available as of a week or two ago, and that really surprised me.
8380000	8391000	But I guess it's just so expensive and so forth that people are not going to it because it's in the middle of the week or what have you.
8391000	8394000	Or maybe, who knows?
8394000	8400000	Let's see. In chat over at live.vognetwork.com, Bobby Black Wolf in chat says,
8400000	8405000	I'm going to tweet on Tuesday about how much I don't care about Mass Effect because people need to know.
8405000	8411000	Actually, you know what's interesting about that, Bobby, is that I probably won't see that tweet because I won't be reading tweets.
8411000	8413000	I won't be playing Mass Effect.
8413000	8418000	While I'm at work, I won't be playing Mass Effect. But then when I get home, I'm going to go straight to Mass Effect.
8418000	8428000	Clearly, I'm very tired, and I should just take this lack of calls and this dinner being placed in front of me as a sign that maybe we should wrap up the show.
8428000	8431000	Let's see. A couple other comments here in chat mentioned here.
8431000	8434000	Bobby is also saying E3 is turning away industry people, too.
8434000	8442000	Yeah, a lot of podcasters and smaller journalistic sites that I know of not getting in the way they were before
8442000	8446000	because now ESA expects them to pay a couple hundred bucks to do it.
8446000	8451000	So it will be interesting to see what that changed coverage is going to look like.
8451000	8457000	As the show on 100 Mountain wants to know what's for dinner, Chipotle, did you bring enough for the class? No.
8457000	8464000	All right. Well, I guess I'll take this lack of phone calls as a sign. We're going to wrap it up.
8464000	8467000	But you can always email us if you were too shy to call tonight.
8467000	8470000	Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to send us an email.
8470000	8474000	That's going to do it, though, for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
8474000	8479000	Thank you guys so much for tuning into our show, and if you liked what you heard here at Orange Lounge Radio,
8479000	8482000	please don't forget to tell a friend or five about the show.
8482000	8485000	Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice,
8485000	8490000	but if those voices aren't out there, we can't put them out there, so come have them join us.
8490000	8496000	A nice five-star review on a place like iTunes or what have you goes an awful long way as well, so we really appreciate that.
8496000	8500000	We shall go around now and get everybody's final thought for the night.
8500000	8503000	Dark Soccer, your final thought?
8503000	8507000	I have been chatting with someone who I don't know who they are,
8507000	8512000	and I don't even know adding them to my friends list, so I'm totally removing them.
8512000	8514000	And also, resist.
8514000	8519000	Okay. All right. My final thought tonight is, mmm, steak.
8519000	8521000	And, Loki, last but not least, your final thought?
8521000	8524000	I have to go back to my regular job this week.
8524000	8529000	Aww. Oh, that breakout job? Is it still going? I would have thought that would have been a really long-term thing.
8529000	8530000	It's only six weeks.
8530000	8532000	Oh, wow. Time flies.
8532000	8533000	Yeah, time does fly.
8533000	8535000	All right. Well, enjoy what's left of it.
8535000	8538000	Until the next time, we'll see you in seven days,
8538000	8544000	and certainly next week we're going to hear what Dark Soccer and I have to say about Mass Effect Andromeda,
8544000	8547000	as well as you guys out there, and whatever else might be happening in gaming.
8547000	8551000	I know Loki doesn't really care about Mass Effect the same way we do.
8551000	8552000	Nope. Do not care.
8552000	8556000	Well, then you play something else, and let us... Play Rocket League, for fuck's sake.
8556000	8558000	Spend five minutes with that game and tell us what you thought about it.
8558000	8563000	Never wants me to play Overwatch on PC, but I don't think this laptop runs Overwatch.
8563000	8565000	There you go. Overwatch would be a good one.
8565000	8566000	It doesn't run in...
8566000	8569000	I think Orisa's hitting the feeds this week.
8569000	8571000	This won't run Overwatch.
8571000	8572000	That sucks.
8572000	8574000	But it may have to get a new computer.
8574000	8577000	All right. Well, that's going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
8577000	8580000	We'll see you in seven days. Have a good one, everybody. Take care.
