0	17640	It's here, it's here, the latest release of worldly travel with technology along the
17640	18640	way.
18640	21800	That's right, Horizon Zero Dawn is finally out to scratch all your mechanical overload
21800	22800	survival dr...
22800	23800	No.
23800	24800	What?
24800	25800	The Switch.
25800	26800	What, like a light switch?
26800	27800	No, the Nintendo Switch.
27800	33320	What's a Nintendo Switch?
33320	36160	This week, the Nintendo Switch was released.
36160	43840	Stay tuned for more!
43840	46880	Jason just totally pulled in, I don't even know her there in the intro.
46880	49360	Hi everybody, my friends out there on the internet.
49360	53920	Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice, it is Orange Lounge
53920	59440	Radio, live tonight, March the 5th of 2017, episode number 678 of our show.
59440	64680	My name is Rob Roberts, joining me in studio, as always, say hello to DarkSakura, or Jamie
64680	65680	Summers.
65680	66680	Words.
66680	67680	Hello.
67680	68680	Greetings.
68680	71120	Sorry to hear you're still sick, but you sound a lot better, you look a lot better.
71120	74520	I feel better, well I've also got a lot of makeup on.
74520	78600	I feel a lot better than I did.
78600	81440	But you have this weird thing with your taste buds, like you were telling me earlier that
81440	83000	chocolate tastes like soap.
83000	87960	Yeah, actually everything tastes vaguely soap-like.
87960	94200	I don't know if it's the Zithromax, but it started happening before I was on azithromycin.
94200	100000	I've been on two different antibiotics, but I feel a lot better than I have in a while.
100000	103960	Well good, feeling better is good, that's where we want you to be.
103960	109920	I feel like Frank, even smiling makes my face ache.
109920	114360	It's funny because when you were talking about that you don't taste things the same, my first
114360	118920	thought y'all was, I want her to lick a Nintendo Switch cartridge live on air.
118920	121600	And I was going to bypass that whole thing because I'm like, okay, that joke is like
121600	127360	played out, like everybody who wanted clicks watched me lick a thing.
127360	132920	And to think, that girl that licked the PSP was a fame whore at that time.
132920	135680	But now y'all licking Nintendo Switch cartridges like the candy.
135680	138440	This would be science.
138960	141280	And then you'd have my DNA on your games.
141280	148280	Yes, and now I'm like Dark Sakura, now we have a reason why for science, exactly, that
148280	151920	maybe she does need to lick a Nintendo Switch cartridge because I want to know if under
151920	156360	the right chemical thing, maybe it tastes like soap as well.
156360	158440	Well if you want, it's your stuff.
158440	162240	Alright, I'm going to think about it while we introduce Tech Master Loki.
162240	165080	The other thing is what it would taste like with those little miracle berries.
165080	167920	Alright, Tech Master Loki, how are you?
168400	169400	I'm fine.
169400	170400	Yeah, good?
170400	171400	Yeah.
171400	175360	You sound a little exhausted when you say that, I'm fine, like it's been a real long
175360	176360	week or something.
176360	180560	It's exhausting eating those 11 breadsticks.
180560	182440	The Dark Sakura ate one, she's like...
182440	187200	I was wondering, you know, for science, you know, since she's tried chocolate and it tastes
187200	190440	like soap, maybe soap tastes like chocolate.
190440	193240	I'm not going to lick soap.
193240	194240	That's unhealthy.
194320	195320	Dark Sakura.
195320	199360	I love the coffee, it's like I'm getting a hint of what the flavor would have tasted
199360	200360	like.
200360	201360	And then soap.
201360	205600	Like freaking ivory bar soap, seriously.
205600	210160	Now I'm sure Dark Sakura, you might be wondering like, why is Dark Sakura eating soap?
210160	211160	To know this.
211160	217640	But I'm sure as a child, she had soap in her mouth a lot and got to know the taste very
217640	218640	well.
218640	223480	Well, a good way to know how something tastes is to smell it.
223800	227760	Because your olfactory scents, which I have none right now, and your sense of taste are
227760	228760	tied.
228760	235480	And when one of those is depressed or whatever, then the other is going to be affected.
235480	238200	And that's the exact thing with the Nintendo Switch cartridge for me.
238200	243640	Like I don't need to lick it because you can smell that new case smell that isn't exactly
243640	244640	pleasant.
244640	245640	It's not a new car smell.
245640	246640	A new car smells nice.
246640	251280	A new cartridge, when you open that, you know, Zelda case for the first time, it's kind of...
251280	252880	I don't even know if I'd go that far.
252880	257200	Like it just smells like, like a chemical that I don't want to eat.
257200	258200	That's what it smells like.
258200	259200	A chemical.
259200	264760	Well, it's just, well, and everything vaguely smells either like soap or blood.
264760	266240	There's no in between.
266240	270040	This is the stupidest sick I've ever had, next to walking pneumonia.
270040	273320	Or is Dark Sakura just cleaning her victims before she kills them?
273320	277200	So if they put that stuff on the cartridge because they don't want to eat, do they put
277200	278200	it on the controllers?
278200	279800	Because I don't think they put it on the controllers.
279800	281440	I don't think they did put it on the controllers.
281440	283240	Have your kids put it in their mouth yet?
283240	285560	I don't, I'm sure I don't have, you know, kids.
285560	289000	I'm sure a kid is, what are you talking about?
289000	291960	You should do have kids.
291960	292960	Ask Nellie.
292960	293960	Hold on a minute.
293960	295840	Did Loki just come out here and be like, I don't have kids.
295840	299480	Like why, why, why are you a pathological liar on tonight's OLR, Loki?
299480	301840	Yes, you do have kids.
301840	307640	It's just my, my path to presidency, right?
307640	309000	I don't have kids, Rob.
309000	310000	You have kids.
310000	313160	I don't think you're the one that has the kids, these are my kids.
313160	314520	They're yours now.
314520	317520	Bringing them over, bye.
317520	318720	Touched them less.
318720	320520	You're the one that's been wiretapping my house.
320520	321520	All right.
321520	322520	Anyway.
322520	323520	Anyway.
323520	327880	No, I don't have a Switch, so obviously I can't eat anything that's in the Switch box.
327880	328880	Right.
328880	331160	So you have, you don't have, you have kids, but you don't have a Switch.
331160	332160	That's, that's the difference.
332160	334440	Yeah, I have kids and no Switch.
334440	338960	And I'm not planning on buying a Switch and I also didn't buy Zelda because I don't have
338960	341080	$60 right now to spend on Zelda.
341080	345080	So I will just wait a couple of weeks and play it then.
345080	346360	Money, serious business.
346360	350400	Well, I could, I could buy it now, but then there may be a chance that I won't be able
350400	351920	to afford food later in the week.
351920	352920	That would be unfortunate.
352920	353920	Yeah.
353920	357200	I would just rather not do that because I don't need to.
357200	359480	I'm already playing Skyrim, so I don't need that.
359480	360480	All right.
360480	362960	We'll talk a little more about the Switch here in a moment because it's that thing everybody's
362960	363960	talking about.
363960	366880	But I want to get to our chat room, of course, and acknowledge you guys live in our chat
366880	370720	room because we do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock
370720	373560	Eastern at vognetwork.com.
373560	378600	That's V-O-G network.com right after the Bobby Black Wolf show, who talked also a lot tonight
378600	379960	about the Nintendo Switch.
379960	383880	Now, obviously there's a, there was a lot that happened in games this week.
383880	385020	It could be easy to sit here.
385020	387320	We could probably talk for three hours about the Nintendo Switch.
387320	389880	However, there's a ton of other stuff that happened in gaming.
389880	392160	Game developers conference happened this week.
392160	393160	Hello.
393160	394160	But it was interesting.
394220	398240	We didn't really get a lot of news out of game developers conference, did we?
398240	404120	We got like weird little like tidbits and insight, like w w like that eight bit Zelda
404120	408260	picture that came up where everybody was like, Oh my God, it's Zelda maker.
408260	413320	But no, like a Nintendo would not announce a Zelda maker at a GDC type event.
413320	418460	B what it ended up really being was that, you know, Breath of the Wild was basically
418460	424020	created in that eight bit environment to build some of the, you know, ideas that they
424020	428580	had going into that game were kind of executed in the eight bit format before they, they
428580	435300	did the big fancy world that they have now making a long story prototyping the, the concepts.
435300	436300	Yeah.
436300	438660	There's a lot of talk about like what goes into game development.
438660	439660	That's really it.
439660	443780	I mean, there's other little things here and there, like the first 10 minutes of the, um,
443780	445300	gone home successor, was it Tacoma?
445300	448140	So what it's called like, I think like the first 10 minutes of that were shown, it's
448140	451660	just like some little tidbits here and there, but not a very news filled game developers
451660	456900	conference, nothing like on the scale of like PlayStation move or anything, which again,
456900	461420	game developers conferences, not E3, it is, it is for those types of, but I would totally
461420	467460	go for more, you know, a better PlayStation move if you will.
467460	471500	Well, isn't that kind of what they're trying to do with the VR and those controllers and
471500	472500	everything?
472500	473500	Right.
473500	475040	But I mean, like the PlayStation is not doing that.
475040	476740	They're like, yeah, we have these move controllers.
476740	477740	Those will work.
478340	483100	Uh, some comments in chat over at live.vognetwork.com, uh, because of course, again, we tape live
483100	484100	on Sunday nights.
484100	487400	I want to get to some of our chatters, uh, SSU100Matt talking about the taste test for
487400	491580	Dark Sakura says, the real question we need to know, what does pinkberry taste like?
491580	494180	I think someone should go get her some to test this.
494180	496020	I agree with this, but I will tell you this.
496020	500020	I have orange sherbet at home and it tastes kind of off too.
500020	501420	Does it taste like soap?
501420	506060	Not quite like soap, but like orange medicine.
506060	507100	Oh.
507460	508460	Like Dayquil or something.
508460	509460	Kinda.
509460	510460	Yeah.
510460	514340	It's like the edge between, this tastes really good to, this tastes like fucking Dayquil.
514340	515340	Mm hmm.
515340	516340	So, or like Theraflu.
516340	521540	Uh, Darktosea in chat says, I just thought that thing was neat, interesting way to prototype
521540	522540	for Breath of the Wild.
522540	525620	Uh, yeah, I thought it was a neat, uh, discussion too.
525620	530060	Um, and that's, you know, again, what GDC is really for is about like here, here's how
530060	531620	the sausage is made type of thing.
531620	535500	Here's the thought process that went into what we made and yeah, Black Wolf kind of
535500	539020	echoing there in chat, GDC shouldn't be for news anyway.
539020	544820	Um, yeah, I can agree with that to a point, but you also in the past, they have dropped
544820	548460	a few bombshells here and there, but that's usually Sony that's done that, right?
548460	552660	They did the move one year and they did, they announced something else one year.
552660	555460	Was it the VR or was it something else they announced GDC?
555460	557540	I want to say it was another one of those things that kind of came a win.
557540	562180	I don't think it was the VR, but anyway, like, you know, sometimes with those tech development,
562180	565580	you might get a little, little few drops here and there because while you have all these
565580	570300	game developers there, they want these developers to think about, Ooh, how could I develop for
570300	571300	that?
571300	572300	Right.
572300	574580	That's why you announced the PlayStation move early like that is, Ooh, how can I develop
574580	575580	for this?
575580	579520	But you know, you're not going to get like, Oh my God, Half Life 3, like that's not going
579520	581340	to fucking happen at a game developers conference.
581340	586400	So, you know, it, it is for talks and, um, a lot of networking that goes on at the, those
586400	587400	events for sure.
587400	592000	Uh, wheeling and dealing of those sorts, but, um, otherwise, yeah, it's, it's, it is for
592000	593000	the developers.
593000	594880	Uh, thank you, Bobby Black Wolf.
594880	595880	That's it.
595880	597280	PlayStation home was announced to GDC.
597280	598280	That's right.
598280	599280	That was the other thing I was thinking of.
599280	600280	Thank you.
600280	601280	Uh, let's see.
601280	607240	Also in chat, um, over at live.vognetwork.com actdeft is wondering, did dark soccer confuse
607240	609480	dove soap with dove chocolate?
609480	611480	That's a, that's a great question.
611480	614920	Very, you know, your products at a supermarket, very well done.
615880	616880	Let's see.
616880	621880	Uh, Stoppy talking about the, uh, eight bit Zelda thing says, uh, I call that BS.
621880	625440	It's like saying checkers was a prototype for tactical RPGs.
625440	626440	I don't know.
626440	627440	I kind of thought it was neat.
627440	631080	There's a lot of, there, there is a lot of stuff from Zelda one that I see in the new
631080	633960	Zelda, but we'll, we'll get to that in a little bit.
633960	636360	Being that I was doing prototyping all this week.
636360	637360	Yeah.
637360	640880	Um, no, that is how you do prototyping because you don't want to spend a ton of time and
640880	646040	money on an elaborate prototype when you're just prototyping certain concepts like the
646040	651160	fire spreading thing and trying to solve, you know, puzzles in multiple ways.
651160	652560	You don't need anything elaborate.
652560	655360	You just want to try it so that you can get feedback right away.
655360	656360	I'm kind of surprised.
656360	659840	I mean, again, I don't know all the insides of your, your project you're doing and I know
659840	664260	I'm not supposed to, but I'm kind of surprised you guys didn't go to GDC for a day or anything
664260	665260	like that.
665260	666260	I was kind of surprised.
666260	669360	So, yeah, we don't think we need to not in the budget.
669360	673800	Well, not in the budget and not really needed at this point yet.
673800	674800	Fair enough.
674800	675800	Fair enough.
675800	676800	All right.
676800	678120	Um, so let's talk about here for our kickoff topic tonight.
678120	679320	Let's talk about the Nintendo switch.
679320	681920	What do y'all think over in chat over at live.fognetwork.com?
681920	685120	Those of you that picked one up, do you, do you think it was worth the money?
685120	687560	Uh, do you, are you happy with your purchase?
687560	689560	Where, where's your head out with the Nintendo switch?
689560	692600	Um, I'll talk about my thoughts in a little bit.
692600	697160	Um, I want to get to dark soccer though, because you spent, even though you and Dan did not
697160	703140	buy a switch, but you did buy Zelda Breath of the Wild on Wii U and you played a buddy's
703140	706240	switch for a good 30 minutes or something like that.
706240	707240	Yeah.
707240	708640	Um, he brought his switch to work.
708640	711120	So while he was working, I was on lunch.
711120	712120	I played for a little bit.
712120	714800	So you didn't walk away that impressed with it, huh?
714800	715800	Not really.
715800	718520	It's nothing that I would want to go out and spend money on right away or would have waited
718520	721560	for the reservation or anything like that.
721560	731400	So for, for me, the, there was two, I don't know, the controller when using just the controller
731400	736400	felt too lightweight, too almost flimsy to me.
736400	740560	I mean, the buttons were nice, they were responsive, but it didn't feel substantial.
740560	745340	It had the same comfort of the Saturn analog controller, which as I'm sure everyone knows
745340	751860	is my favorite home controller, but, um, it didn't have the same sturdiness and heft
751860	752860	to it.
752860	755860	Are we talking about the controllers attached to the screen or are we talking about that
755860	758060	little puppy dog shell, the controller shell?
758060	759060	Okay.
759060	760060	Okay.
760060	761060	Just the control.
761060	762060	Cause we had the little screen out independently.
762060	763060	Right.
763060	766580	And graphically I didn't see too much of a difference except it was a little bit harder
766580	771340	to see cause that smaller screen, it's still actually was cause even on the Wii U there's
771340	776060	a, uh, uh, areas where you'll get draw distance issues and the same thing was happening on
776060	777460	that little screen.
777460	782820	And then, um, the other thing is that it was kind of hard to see, like the motion was a
782820	785580	little bit harder to detect on that smaller screen.
785580	790980	And then, um, with it connected with the, the joy con connected on either side and at
790980	793560	that point then felt too bulky.
793560	796860	So it just like there wasn't a happy medium with it.
796860	799060	Um, I haven't tried it on a TV yet.
799060	804840	I would, I'm curious, but, um, I would actually be more curious to see it on my TV so that
804840	806980	I can actually switch channels.
806980	812900	Um, this is something that Dan and I did with, um, Symphony of the Night where we had the
812900	818820	PlayStation one and the Saturn one and we're switching between, uh, channels to see what,
818820	821020	you know, do a graphical comparison.
821020	826560	I'd really like to get to the same place in both games and then switch channels to see
826560	832640	what it looks like to compare because I think doing it on two different TVs wouldn't be
832640	836900	a really good test because different TVs display different ways, but I'd like to see it like
836900	839180	on my TV both ways.
839180	844840	So even though your perception of Zelda in particular was a little more negative, these
844840	848980	first impressions of the Switch, you're still kind of like, I'm still open to get one when
848980	851120	the games start coming out a little later on, right?
851120	852120	That's, that's kind of the sense I got from you.
852120	856400	There is no reason for me to have one right now, because I mean, there's no Animal Crossing
857240	864640	Um, the other game that I wanted, Puyo Puyo Tetris, I already own, I have it on PS4.
864640	869200	And so there's, there's legitimately no reason for me to have one.
869200	873880	But when we start talking about the Splatoon twos and the Mario Odyssey's and whatever
873880	874880	other surprises.
874880	875880	I haven't played the first Splatoon.
875880	876880	Oh, you're missing out.
876880	877880	So I'm not excited.
877880	878880	It's fun.
878880	879880	You're missing out.
879880	880880	I'm sure it is, but I'm not excited.
880880	885840	I mean, I have no basis of comparison and Mario, I mean, I'll be honest, I'm not as
886280	892160	excited over Mario games these days, you know, I want there to be something that is going
892160	895880	to, uh, I think be more exciting.
895880	900320	I want something unique, something different, you know, I mean, the only thing out right
900320	905440	now that I would want to play is Binding of Isaac two and even then, you know, and that's
905440	906440	not actually out yet.
906440	907440	Yeah.
907440	908440	It's not on the story yet.
908440	912440	At least not in the U S they had the, um, the advanced orders.
912440	915240	I think it's like soon it's within the next couple of weeks.
915240	918760	I think they're really trying to use the Indies to kind of pace out some of the releases
918760	921360	a little bit like blaster master is next week.
921360	922360	Yeah.
922360	926040	So, and that's, I'm really excited about that is happier about that, but I'm still not,
926040	928160	I'm still not sold.
928160	932280	And I mean, I went into two different game stops today, um, because I was looking for
932280	937700	Wii U pro controller, which they didn't have, I got it at target, although I did get a Jessica
937700	942080	Jones pop figure cause it's the only place I've seen it, but you know, and I was just
942080	945600	talking to the staff, you know, just, you know, shooting the shit.
945600	949960	And they're like, yeah, they all went out really quickly, but you know, we haven't had,
949960	953520	you know, other than that, there hasn't been too many people in asking about them.
953520	959160	So it was kind of like that initial rush, but you haven't had a lot of like either just
959160	962680	people kind of know they're gone or yeah, they just like, yeah, we're going to get some
962680	968140	more, but right now the only ones that we have in stock are, um, our, uh, orders.
968140	972420	And they said that, um, even then no one's come to pick some of those up.
972420	978040	Um, going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com, uh, come on, Noel, Gus and chat says it's
978040	979040	been underwhelming.
979040	983540	I love breath of the wild, but other than that, it feels like a generic Android tablet.
983540	986960	If I could play Overwatch on it, I probably wouldn't complain, but yeah, it sucks.
986960	989020	There aren't other games to play.
989020	992760	And then, uh, let's see, act deft in chat over at live.vognetwork.com said I would give
992760	995700	my opinion on the switch, but we all know what happened.
996260	998660	Amazon apparently fucked a lot of people over.
998660	1005940	Um, and I feel kind of bad because I got, I ordered from Amazon and I got it.
1005940	1010700	Uh, I was a little worried though for a minute, which is the whole reason why I had the two
1010700	1012780	systems pre-ordered in the very beginning.
1012780	1017060	I also had one from Best Buy, but I was able to find a home for the Best Buy one and I
1017060	1020220	don't, I don't scalp, I charged exactly what I paid for it.
1020220	1024760	So it worked out all in the end or what have you, but yeah, Amazon really screwed a lot
1024760	1025760	of people over.
1025760	1030320	Uh, and apparently they were like charging cards when they didn't really have the inventory
1030320	1034460	or they were, they weren't charging, they were putting the hold on them and Amazon had
1034460	1035680	no reason to do that.
1035680	1040040	So I was, because they didn't have the stock for it, they didn't make good on the delivery.
1040040	1044840	And I think Amazon has a big part of its, its case that it tries to do with Amazon Prime
1044840	1046780	is that you get the release day delivery.
1046780	1051040	So a lot of the crap they've been pulling from what I'm hearing, again, my experience
1051040	1056600	ended up being fine, but I know several people, not just Act Deaf, but I know quite a few
1056600	1059440	other people that were having problems with Amazon.
1059440	1063880	So I think that was kind of bullshit on Amazon's part and I'm kind of glad they're getting
1063880	1067080	dragged through the media for it and I sort of think it's unacceptable they didn't have
1067080	1068080	an answer yet.
1068080	1074280	Um, so I, I hope that Amazon comes out on Monday to talk a little more about how they're
1074280	1078480	going to prevent that kind of crap in the future because that was, uh, that was, um,
1078480	1082920	really just, it makes a lot of people question if they want to order stuff from Amazon in
1082920	1083920	the future.
1083920	1088800	Uh, when it comes to like release day delivery and all that stuff, I mean, ordering a Blu-ray
1088800	1092160	that you don't need right away or something is one thing, but you know, when you want
1092160	1095720	something on the day it releases because that's where all the hype is at or whatever, like
1095720	1096960	that's what you expect.
1096960	1098800	So, um, yeah.
1098800	1102120	The worst part to me is the fact that Amazon put a hold on the cards.
1102120	1105040	Uh, that's, that's the part that I can't reconcile in my mind.
1105040	1110160	Like it would be one crime for them to, well, not, not actual crime, but it'd be customer
1110160	1111160	service crime.
1111160	1114760	It'd be one thing for them to not deliver on the promise they made, but it's a whole,
1114760	1119320	like it's even worse that they put the holds on the cards and still didn't deliver on it.
1119320	1123640	That is really fucked up and, uh, Amazon needs to answer for that.
1123640	1128480	I, I, I told one of my friends to file a complaint with a better business bureau, but my friend
1128480	1131840	was like, oh, that never does anything and that I'm like, well, it doesn't do anything
1131840	1134840	because everybody's, everybody, well, everybody's
1134840	1138040	he sits there and says, I'm, it's not going to do anything.
1138040	1140920	If everybody who sat there and says, it's not going to do anything, did something, then
1140920	1145640	it would force Amazon to at least answer the question about what's going on.
1145640	1151300	And I, they may have put, I think I did, they, they put some, you know, very general type
1151300	1156680	of thing out there, but it is really messed up that Amazon had, they were saying, come
1156680	1158080	to our bookstores.
1158080	1163040	We've got the Amazon's or the Nintendo switch here at our Amazon bookstores come to this
1163040	1167580	and, and was advertising all these other ways, but yet they could not fulfill the obligations
1167580	1172840	that they had in the other side to, to me that says, is Amazon too big of a company?
1172840	1174380	Does it need to be broken up?
1174380	1178080	Cause it doesn't know what the other ends of the company are doing, but I will go there,
1178080	1186320	but I'm just, no, you know what they should do instead sell more games through other platforms.
1186320	1187320	I see what you did there.
1187320	1188320	Yeah.
1188320	1189320	We'll get to that a little later.
1189320	1190320	Okay.
1190320	1191320	Um, okay.
1191320	1195040	Let me talk about me and the Nintendo switch though, because, um, I'm, I'm walking away
1195040	1196960	from it feeling more positive.
1196960	1201100	I think a lot of the complaints that have been put out here on this show, especially
1201100	1206320	in regards to, um, the amount of software that's out right now and all that stuff.
1206320	1212200	Uh, the fact that the OS is, is pretty much half baked, that there's a lot to come soon.
1212200	1214160	That all still kind of holds true.
1214160	1218040	But I will say this, I walked away from it feeling different than dark Sakura.
1218040	1221360	I thought the controllers in the shell, I really liked the way that felt.
1221360	1226720	Um, and especially when I was playing a game like fast racing remix, when the HD vibrations
1226720	1229960	came into play, which you can even feel in the shell, like I thought that was a really
1229960	1231720	good feel for the game.
1231720	1234980	Um, so I actually liked the controller.
1234980	1238760	It is a little bulky when you have the controllers on the side and you're playing it as a tablet.
1238760	1241620	That was not my favorite way to play.
1241620	1243200	And I don't think I'll be doing that a lot.
1243200	1246800	Like I, I, you know, tried it a couple of times this weekend.
1246800	1251000	Like I would lay in bed and play Zelda or something like that, which it is kind of a
1251000	1253960	small screen for a game like Zelda.
1253960	1255140	There's a lot going on.
1255140	1258360	I think that small screen probably works, works a lot better with something like probably
1258360	1262740	the one, two switch game or like fast racing Neo or something where there's not as much
1262740	1267400	like writing or small details in the distance things you're looking for, uh, that probably
1267400	1268400	work a little better.
1268400	1272860	Um, on a television, they do that, that, that, uh, tablet.
1272860	1280340	But to the tablet's credit, I was like, wow, this is a very bright, vibrant, detailed screen.
1280340	1284140	And I, I thought it was a neat little piece of technology.
1284140	1287380	And I think the whole thing feels really sleek to me.
1287380	1292220	Like it feels like something Apple would have put out, honestly, like the, the switch feels
1292220	1293980	really nice in that regard.
1293980	1299340	And one thing I do like about the OS is that everything really snaps.
1299340	1304020	Everything is very fast and I've gotten to come to accept with Nintendo systems that
1304020	1305920	they're very slow and clunky.
1305920	1310540	Like the Wii, it's like now loading the everybody votes channel, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
1310540	1311540	whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
1311540	1313900	Like in that whole thing or the eShop, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, like it's
1313900	1318100	like one loading screen turns into another loading screen turns into like, it's really,
1318100	1319220	really slow.
1319220	1322920	But on the switch, everything is pretty fast.
1322920	1328380	Like going in, going into your picture gallery to edit the picture and share the picture
1328420	1330300	is like navigating a website.
1330300	1335860	It's really fast and not like a clunky mess.
1335860	1340420	Like it kind of is on the 3DS trying to share things to Miiverse.
1340420	1344940	I am a little surprised though that Nintendo did not take the opportunity to, when you
1344940	1348920	have this friends list and you have these things that you're sharing, I'm really surprised
1348920	1353820	that it didn't create a newsfeed type of thing like you have on PlayStation 4.
1353820	1355300	Maybe that's something that will come in the future.
1355300	1361260	I don't know, but the OS on the Switch, as we all know, is very bare bones right now.
1361260	1363600	There is really not a lot there.
1363600	1367860	One of the other big things that came out this week, the whole fact that friend codes
1367860	1372380	are back and they're on the Nintendo Switch, which we thought Nintendo was fucking done
1372380	1375620	with, but it looked like they weren't.
1375620	1379680	However, this is a big however, it does function very differently.
1379680	1385640	It's not quite as bad as it was on the Wii because, picture this, instead of a gamer
1385640	1388540	tag right now, you have a barcode number.
1388540	1389960	That's basically how it works.
1389960	1393080	So if somebody knows your barcode number, they can still send you a friend request.
1393080	1396120	You don't have to do that whole thing where it's like, I'm going to add you, then you're
1396120	1399080	going to add me, and then if we both added each other, we'll be friends.
1399080	1400760	You don't have to wait for that whole process.
1400760	1403720	You still send a friend request like you do on the other consoles.
1403720	1408160	The other thing is that strangely, even though on the Switch you can't search Twitter and
1408160	1412120	Facebook for your friends, even though the system connects to Twitter and Facebook for
1412120	1418160	the sharing of the pictures, you can see who you've added on Miitomo and who you've added
1418160	1421280	on Super Mario Run.
1421280	1426360	I still have not played the Fire Emblem game, but I imagine that's there too.
1426360	1429520	Those games will connect to your Twitter and your Facebook.
1429520	1433520	So since I added most of my Facebook Nintendo peeps through those games, they're all showing
1433520	1434520	up on my list.
1434520	1441240	My only grievance is that the list that's showing up is like everybody's first name
1441240	1445320	because it's not showing their tags or their Nintendo Network names or whatever.
1445320	1449680	It's showing whatever they use to sign into their console at home, which most people use
1449680	1451000	their first name.
1451000	1457280	Now I use Rob Roberts just because that's just become synonymous with my identity online
1457280	1458280	and everything.
1458280	1460560	So I know when I'm sending friend requests to people, they see Rob Roberts, and it's
1460560	1462760	pretty easy to know who I am.
1462760	1464300	Bobby was talking about this on his show.
1464300	1465420	His name is Black Wolf.
1465420	1467180	So I know who that was.
1467180	1472260	But then I'll get a friend request from Chris and I'm like, who the hell is Chris?
1472260	1474760	And I'm like, this me doesn't look very familiar to me.
1474760	1479940	I know like five different Chris's and maybe this is somebody on Twitter where like, if
1479940	1483620	it was their Twitter handle, I'd know who it is instantly or if it's their Twitter picture.
1483620	1484620	Yeah.
1484620	1485620	New Switch, who dis?
1485620	1489680	That's exactly the game that I've been playing all week.
1489680	1490940	But here's the other thing.
1490940	1494660	And the reason why I haven't been giving out my friend code or really seeking out to expand
1494660	1499580	my friends list right now, why, why do I need friends on the Switch?
1499580	1505700	There's literally nothing it does, except I can see when they're online and what they're
1505700	1506700	playing.
1506700	1508000	Can't send them messages.
1508000	1511740	I don't have any games that I can, I have Zelda and I have fast remix and I probably
1511740	1515100	will end up buying Shovel Knight before the week is up and I'll probably get Blaster Master
1515100	1516100	next week.
1516100	1518820	That's a pretty, that's a nice little set of games there for the first two weeks of
1518820	1524980	a console, but none of them connect to online and use my friends list yet.
1524980	1529700	Fast Rebracing is supposed to do that in its first update, but otherwise what's the point
1529700	1530700	of a friends list right now?
1530700	1531700	There really isn't one.
1531700	1535980	It's just kind of like you're building it out because you hope that later on when Splatoon
1535980	1540980	2 comes out, which is really going to need that online thing to be done, then you have
1540980	1544780	your friends list built up so that you have lots of people to splatter with point paint
1544780	1546980	a little later on.
1546980	1555100	So even though there's some weird shit with the friend codes and these other things that
1555100	1560900	are definitely like half baked and under finished in the OS, what it does do, it does very well
1560900	1562460	and it does it fast.
1562460	1567780	And it does have me excited for like, wow, when this gets to the holiday and Nintendo
1567780	1572700	really sees out its roadmap and you know there's a roadmap because you go to one thing and
1572700	1576460	it'll be like, this feature will be enabled when we go online in June.
1576460	1580460	This feature will be enabled when such and such launches in October.
1580460	1584020	This feature will be enabled when we figure out how to do networking.
1584020	1589540	It's like you see everything's got a month with it, but I am excited to see what it's
1589540	1594100	going to look like towards the end of the year because I think at the end of the year,
1594100	1598020	this is going to function a lot more like we kind of thought it was going to in the
1598020	1602060	beginning and maybe some of these shortcomings will be fixed.
1602060	1606860	Which brings me to the other thing I want to do here at the top of the show, which was
1606860	1608300	something we talked about last week.
1608300	1612740	So last week I said, what we need to do is we need to, since we know the Switch is going
1612740	1617160	to change a lot before December, we need to have the world's smallest time capsule or
1617160	1618740	shortest time capsule.
1618740	1623660	So we're going to actually build one here in studio that we will open at the end of
1623660	1626420	the year for either the Christmas show or the New Year's show.
1626420	1628780	So here's the deal.
1628780	1631540	Stoppy in chat says, Sky, did you remember to bring the sock?
1631540	1632660	No, good news.
1632660	1633940	We don't have to do the sock tonight.
1633940	1636660	Well, maybe I'll put a sock in there, but here's the thing.
1636660	1640300	Dark Sakura found a target in the discount aisle or something.
1640300	1643460	She's got this little like Darth Vader looking thing.
1643460	1645500	Is this like a kid's bank or something?
1645500	1649700	Yeah, it's like a little coin bank, but it has the shape I wanted.
1649700	1651020	It has the shape.
1651020	1652020	It's perfect.
1652020	1655980	It actually looks like something that you could like shove up an elephant's butt.
1655980	1657640	That's what it looks like to me.
1657680	1659160	It's an elephant suppository.
1659160	1660160	Exactly.
1660160	1662560	But that's, I guess that's what a time capsule should be, right?
1662560	1667120	So we're going to, we're going to put some things now in the time capsule.
1667120	1668360	What are we going to put in here?
1668360	1675680	We want to put, what are our grievances with Nintendo Switch that we hope they fix by holiday?
1675680	1678920	What do we hope the Switch looks like by holiday?
1678920	1681840	That's what we're going to put here inside the time capsule.
1681840	1686080	So I'm going to get some pieces of paper here and I brought two pieces of paper.
1686080	1688800	Sorry, I guess we'll have to share a little bit, but Loki, here you go.
1688800	1692640	I'll give you a piece of paper, save one for me because I want to start writing.
1692640	1694320	I did not prepare well for this.
1694320	1699160	Oh, if you guys in chat over at live.vognetwork.com have some ideas.
1699160	1700160	No, I think that's-
1700160	1701160	I don't get to contribute.
1701160	1702160	No, you get to contribute.
1702160	1703160	We just have to share a little bit.
1703160	1704160	Geez.
1704160	1705160	But you have to tell-
1705160	1706160	I don't want to share.
1706160	1707160	On my own.
1707160	1708160	Tough.
1708160	1709160	I'm going to wash, I'm going to wash your mouth out with soap.
1709160	1711320	I'm going to wash your mouth out with chocolate.
1711320	1712760	All right.
1712760	1716040	Anyway, I'm going to get a pen over here.
1716040	1717800	We need to start talking about the grievances.
1717800	1720540	Loki, I know you have some grievances.
1720540	1722960	What are you going to put in the time capsule, Loki?
1722960	1724960	I don't know.
1724960	1728040	I haven't actually played the system yet.
1728040	1732520	I mean, I have lots of grievances, mainly stop releasing unfinished consoles, goddammit.
1732520	1733520	But that's not-
1733520	1734520	Okay.
1734520	1735520	Hold on.
1735520	1736520	Hold on.
1736520	1737520	That's not a grievance.
1737520	1738520	Yeah, I know that they can fix.
1738520	1739520	Yeah.
1739520	1743140	Well, it is one they could fix, but that's not going to be fixed for several years.
1743140	1745860	That's not something they can do by the end of the year.
1745860	1746860	That's the problem.
1746860	1749820	Is it supposed to be like what I think the grievances are going to be by then?
1749820	1750820	So like if I say-
1750820	1751820	No.
1751820	1752820	Here, let me give you an example.
1752820	1755740	Here's the first thing I'm going to put in the time capsule.
1755740	1759000	Did they bundle?
1759000	1760000	Did they bundle?
1760000	1761000	I'm actually writing.
1761000	1762000	That's what I'm talking about.
1762000	1767840	Did they bundle one, two, switch in yet?
1767840	1769100	That's the first thing I'm going to put in.
1769100	1770620	Did they bundle one, two, switch in yet?
1770620	1772100	I'm going to put a statement.
1772100	1773100	Aw, fucking hell.
1773100	1776700	They delayed the new Super Mario Brothers game again.
1776700	1779580	There, you could put that in there.
1779580	1780580	You write that.
1780580	1784420	I bet they delayed Mario Brothers there.
1784420	1786060	And we're going to sign these too.
1786060	1788220	You have to be responsible for the crap you put in there.
1788220	1789220	All right.
1789220	1790220	So there's my first.
1790220	1791820	Did they bundle one, two, switch in yet?
1791820	1792820	Signed Rob.
1792820	1794380	So Loki's putting in.
1794380	1796500	Did they delay the Mario game?
1796500	1798180	All right.
1798180	1800620	Dark Soccer, I see you writing over there.
1800620	1801620	What are you writing?
1802140	1803140	Virtual Console.
1803140	1804420	Oh, yeah.
1804420	1806580	Where's my damn Virtual Console?
1806580	1808020	I had another one too.
1808020	1809420	And what's that you're going to write?
1809420	1816820	The DS Store or like some of the old games like they had on the DS Store.
1816820	1819540	So like, did they add DS to Virtual Console?
1819540	1822500	Well, they did do that on the Wii U though.
1822500	1825420	I don't know how they would do that with the switch because there's just the one screen.
1825420	1826620	I don't know if they would do that.
1826620	1828020	I guess they might.
1828820	1833220	You could do something where maybe you tilt the tablet vertically and it could be two
1833220	1834220	screens.
1834220	1835220	Just scrap that.
1835220	1836220	Okay.
1836220	1837220	I would go with augmented reality.
1837220	1838220	Oh.
1838220	1841860	It doesn't have a camera on it, but if it had, it doesn't have a camera on it, does
1841860	1842860	it?
1842860	1843860	No, it doesn't have a camera on it.
1843860	1844860	What about virtual reality?
1844860	1846980	Some people suspect they could go that direction with it.
1846980	1849420	No, I want augmented reality.
1849420	1854980	Like for example, if it had like a camera attachment, you could then, you know, like
1854980	1857820	things like Ingress or, you know.
1857820	1858820	Pokemon Go.
1858820	1859820	Or Pokemon Go.
1859820	1860820	Exactly.
1860820	1861820	Okay.
1861820	1862820	Okay.
1862820	1863820	Now I see where you're going with this.
1863820	1868500	Because you can, we do know Nintendo is going, you might think like, well, that's not going
1868500	1872020	to work, Jamie, because the tablet has nothing in it besides wifi.
1872020	1877020	However, we know the tablet is going to connect to your phone through an app because that's
1877020	1878540	how the voice chat's going to work.
1878540	1885020	So theoretically, what's stopping that tablet from being like a Pokemon Go Plus or something?
1885020	1888300	Doesn't it work in the same way where it's using the information from your phone to get
1888300	1889300	the data it needs?
1889300	1893980	Or even so, like the way that, you know, I have a first gen Apple watch and it doesn't
1893980	1898820	have the built in GPS, but it'll still, I can go walk around the block, come back and
1898820	1904040	sync my data and it would pull my GPS based off my phone, my phone location.
1904040	1908140	So the same thing in theory could work on the Wii U, I mean not the Wii U, but the Switch.
1908140	1909140	Yeah, I know.
1909140	1912100	I see the people in chat saying there's, you need a GPS attachment for that.
1912100	1913240	There's no GPS.
1913240	1915440	If it does Bluetooth though, it'll connect to the phone.
1915440	1919000	It could, I think it is a stretch, but why not?
1919000	1920000	Yeah.
1920000	1921000	Just a tad.
1921000	1925120	It's, it's like, Hey, I've got this phone that could totally run, you know, Pokemon
1925120	1929840	Go with the GPS and the data, but instead I'm going to tether to this large cumbersome
1929840	1930840	thing.
1930840	1935360	I'm not saying specifically Pokemon Go, I'm saying you can have a more advanced augmented
1935360	1936360	reality.
1936360	1941880	But the money was in Pokemon Go, so why wouldn't there be something else AR that Nintendo is
1941880	1942880	going to try?
1942920	1947400	I'm going to be this year myself, but, but that would be something I think would be definitely
1947400	1948880	something that would get more people to buy it.
1948880	1949880	All right.
1949880	1950880	Well write it down.
1950880	1951880	What the fuck?
1951880	1952880	All right.
1952880	1953880	Good.
1953880	1954880	All right.
1954880	1955880	Uh, let's see.
1955880	1956880	Um, go into it.
1956880	1957880	I'm looking into chat over at live.fognetwork.com.
1957880	1959280	JD has a good one.
1959280	1960800	Better me import.
1960800	1965380	It's dumb that it can't pull from the Nintendo account or me Tomo.
1965380	1966380	That's a good point.
1966380	1967380	We're going to write that.
1967380	1969880	We're going to write that one down and we'll credit that to JP.
1969880	1971680	Oh, do you write that one down for JD?
1971680	1972680	Okay.
1972680	1973680	I was trying that one for JD.
1973680	1975180	I was thinking of it too.
1975180	1976180	So I totally agree with that.
1976180	1977180	So you stole it.
1977180	1978180	All right.
1978180	1979180	No, no, no, no.
1979180	1981680	I credited it to him, but I was thinking I would like me verse.
1981680	1982680	Fair enough.
1982680	1983680	Fair enough.
1983680	1984680	Uh, Oh, okay.
1984680	1985680	Here's a good one from dungeon buster.
1985680	1986680	I'm going to write this one down.
1986680	1987680	Okay.
1987680	1992120	Dungeon buster said, has Nintendo lowered the bullshit pricing for their pro controller
1992120	1993120	yet?
1993120	1994120	And I liked, yes.
1994120	1995120	What do you mean?
1995120	1997480	The Wii U pro controller went down.
1997480	2000680	I'd imagine that the switch pro controller, not in a year, not in the first year.
2000680	2001680	It's not going to happen.
2001680	2003720	Not in the first year, but I'll write it down.
2003720	2004720	I'll just write down.
2004720	2006480	Did any of the accessories go down in price yet?
2006480	2010480	Cause they're all that fucking was it the doc or whatever.
2010480	2016040	I saw the tear down video that is not $90 with a tech as just fucking plastic and like
2016040	2018960	some pastors and that's it.
2018960	2019960	Some bullshit.
2019960	2022040	That's what that is.
2022040	2023040	Okay.
2023040	2024040	Dungeon buster.
2024040	2028080	You know, this whole writing thing doesn't make for very good radio.
2028080	2029520	Well, I can read mine then.
2029520	2030520	All right.
2030520	2031520	All right.
2032360	2033360	And this is only obvious.
2033360	2039280	I bet the system's hacked already.
2039280	2040960	Two months to Linux.
2040960	2043200	I don't even give it that.
2043200	2044200	Yeah.
2044200	2048160	It's, they're already trying to find exploits and it's only going to piss people off more
2048160	2053520	that they block out, you know, features that most of their consumers like, you know, like
2053520	2056320	being able to back up their data and stuff like that.
2056320	2058720	And you know, being able to transfer saves.
2058720	2061000	But of course we're so afraid that they're going to get hacked.
2061000	2062000	Oh my goodness.
2062000	2063000	We're so afraid.
2063000	2064000	It's going to get hacked anyway.
2064000	2066400	So you know what?
2066400	2067400	There's nothing you can do.
2067400	2069000	There's nothing you can do.
2069000	2072000	It's just going to happen.
2072000	2080280	Well, there's a whole thing about the, the, the save States and all that.
2080280	2084760	I know, I know you're mentioning, but um, they go online or they'll, they'll work around
2084760	2085760	it.
2085760	2086760	Hacker's going to hack, right?
2086760	2087760	Right.
2087760	2088760	They're already trying to exploit it through the web browser.
2088760	2091560	That doesn't exist, but does exist.
2091560	2096360	People have actually exploited that to create a web browser for it already.
2096360	2101520	Um, let's see what else to, uh, what else do I want to put in the time capsule?
2101520	2104760	Um, I think the virtual console one was good.
2104760	2107560	That was the one I was thinking of as well, but you already got that in there.
2107560	2114980	Um, Oh, maybe with the virtual console though, maybe the whole, like, can we really play
2114980	2117580	the games online virtual console?
2117580	2119980	Like they said on the website, that's what I want to know.
2119980	2121700	I'm going to write that down.
2121700	2122700	Okay.
2122700	2128780	I also would, would like to see better, like some kind of streaming incorporation too,
2128780	2132260	you know, like, uh, kind of like how the PS four does.
2132260	2136780	I mean, if you could take screenshots and post them, you know, what's to say they can't
2136780	2140380	get like recordings eventually.
2140380	2142620	And they're supposed to be doing something like that.
2142620	2148940	So that's not a bad idea either streaming or, um, or like, you know how like you can
2148940	2152860	record video in the Sims.
2152860	2157060	So yeah, or like even Mario Kart, you could sort of do it even though Mario Kart kind
2157060	2158060	of cheated.
2158060	2163500	Mario Kart would, uh, do the replay in a higher rendering, uh, than the actual game was.
2163500	2166300	But I mean, it's still, it worked very well.
2166300	2167300	All right.
2167300	2169300	Uh, let's wrap up.
2169300	2170300	Let's wrap up.
2170460	2172980	Get the last ones written down there and throw them in the time capsule and then we will
2172980	2175900	seal it away to open up towards the end of the year.
2175900	2178320	Fruit flavors of the cartridges.
2178320	2179320	Fruit flavored cartridges.
2179320	2180320	No, no, no, no.
2180320	2181320	We don't want that.
2181320	2182320	All right.
2182320	2185160	Um, so yeah, let's go ahead and get those last few down.
2185160	2187180	So Loki, what are you writing now?
2187180	2188180	I've got three.
2188180	2189180	All right.
2189180	2191820	I bet the online services still shit.
2191820	2197860	Um, no less than two Wii U remakes announced at E3.
2197860	2198860	Okay.
2199860	2204220	Dungeon Buster also suggested that we had our EA and Ubisoft still committed to making
2204220	2205220	games for it.
2205220	2206260	Ooh, I like that one.
2206260	2207300	I like that one.
2207300	2209740	Are EA and Ubisoft still committed to making games for the Switch?
2209740	2211620	Are they committed to the games already?
2211620	2214900	I mean, they were easily committed to the FIFA.
2214900	2219620	So then they come out on stage though and do the whole, just like they did with Wii U.
2219620	2220620	FIFA!
2220620	2221620	FIFA!
2221620	2222620	All right.
2222620	2223620	That was it.
2223620	2224620	All right.
2224620	2225620	We're going to fill the, I don't want the segment to go on too long.
2225620	2228660	So we're going to get the rest of it out there and put them in the time capsule and
2228660	2229660	seal them away.
2229660	2230660	Date it with today.
2230660	2231660	All right.
2231660	2232660	Well, we'll know when it was done.
2232660	2233660	All right.
2233660	2234660	I'm doing it anyway.
2234660	2236660	It was a couple of days after the Switch was released.
2236660	2237660	All right.
2237660	2239220	I'm going to pass this down.
2239220	2243000	And then just for fun, I'm not going to tell you what this one is because it really has
2243000	2246580	nothing to do with games, but it's just a question I want to know the answer to.
2246580	2248380	I want to see if we come back in December.
2248380	2251780	I'll read this question in December when we open the capsule again.
2251780	2253300	And no, my game won't be done by then.
2253300	2257380	I'll show, I'll show my co-host what I'm going to put in there that has nothing to
2257380	2263580	do with video games, but I'm just going to put that question there to see if come December,
2263580	2264900	we find out what the answer is.
2264900	2268180	I think we should each put in like, though, also, you know, when we add these later, we
2268180	2272260	should also do like our top three things that we're playing this month.
2272260	2273260	Okay.
2273260	2274260	All right.
2274260	2275900	We should do that on another piece.
2275900	2276900	All right.
2276900	2277900	Let's do that.
2277900	2279020	We won't see all the time capsule yet.
2279020	2282540	Let's do that when we come back for part B. We'll add those in here as well.
2283140	2284140	All right.
2284140	2291380	So, I'm going to add that last question in for me and everybody else.
2293780	2295100	This is the best radio ever.
2295100	2296100	I know, right?
2296100	2299300	We should have probably done this before we went live tonight, but that's all right.
2299300	2302820	Oh, sorry Dungeon Buster, we've already put up our papers.
2302820	2303820	All right.
2303820	2304820	Put them in.
2304820	2305820	Here we go.
2305820	2306820	All right.
2306820	2309820	We're not going to seal the time capsule yet, but soon, because we'll come back and put
2309820	2313620	in the games we're playing right now, a little later.
2313620	2314620	Good Lord Loki.
2314620	2315620	You could make that smaller pieces.
2315620	2316620	Nope.
2316620	2317620	All right.
2317620	2318620	Well, we needed another part for the next question.
2318620	2319620	No, we don't.
2319620	2321620	Well, we have to put in the time capsule.
2321620	2324620	I'll remember what I've been playing, because I'll be playing Skyrim by then.
2324620	2325620	No, we'll have more.
2325620	2326620	I have more paper over here.
2326620	2327620	It's fine.
2327620	2328620	All right.
2328620	2329620	All right.
2329620	2330620	Wasteful.
2330620	2331620	All right.
2331620	2334600	Speaking of things you're playing, let's talk about our gaming weeks.
2334600	2335740	How is your gaming week?
2335740	2337260	What types of video games have you been playing this week?
2337260	2338260	Dark soccer.
2338260	2341260	Well, it's kind of like Dan and I are both playing Breath of the Wild, because he misses
2341260	2342260	a bunch of shit.
2342260	2343260	So I'm like, hey, hubby.
2343260	2344260	Did you see that?
2344260	2345260	Did you see that?
2345260	2348380	I bet you can steal that meat.
2348380	2350420	Try shooting him in the head.
2350420	2351420	You know, it's just like this.
2351420	2353540	I'm like, no, you're ... Go the other way.
2353540	2356580	I'm backseat driving Breath of the Wild right now.
2356580	2363860	And wow, because I want to do the Gul'dan fight so much in every ... Okay.
2363860	2367620	Every time I get in a group, and we get all the way through everybody, and everything's
2367620	2368620	looking awesome.
2368620	2369620	And then like, oh, we're tired.
2369620	2371260	We don't want to do this one anymore.
2371260	2372260	Quit.
2372260	2380120	I want to beat the last ... Anyway, so I've been playing, and I have been playing a lot
2380120	2386180	of Bust-A-Move lately, trying to beat my 2 million point score, which I haven't yet,
2386180	2389860	because eventually I'll just go, oh, fuck this shit, and stop playing.
2389860	2395340	And Pokemon Go, and Miitomo, just like to make outfits.
2395340	2397860	I've so far made Katya in it.
2397860	2400100	I've made Bianca Del Rio.
2400100	2401100	I've made Lonk.
2401100	2402100	I've made Petch.
2402100	2403100	Lonk and Petch.
2403100	2407860	Oh, so I thought you were going to just have a whole drag queen family, but you just did
2407860	2408860	two.
2408860	2409860	Yeah, I just did two.
2409860	2410860	All right.
2410860	2411860	I might make another one, though.
2411860	2415560	I'm thinking about making Anjina, just because I want a bald me in there.
2415560	2416560	So I don't know.
2416560	2421620	I'm trying to think who else would be totally iconic in appearance.
2421620	2422620	Maybe Violet Chachki.
2422620	2423620	I don't know.
2423620	2428300	But so far, I just have my favorites, Bianca and Katya.
2428300	2432420	And then, although, okay, other complaint time.
2432420	2436500	There's this person who's making this little tiny me called Alice, and I'm fucking sick
2436500	2442500	of seeing Alice all over the fucking little fashion show crap that they have after you
2442500	2443500	do the closet.
2443500	2444500	Alice, stop.
2444500	2447540	Get a life, girl.
2447540	2449540	Seriously.
2449540	2452540	Did Alice go away yet?
2452540	2455820	All right.
2455820	2456820	Anything else for game week?
2456820	2457820	No.
2457820	2458820	All right.
2458820	2459820	Loki, how was your game week?
2459820	2462100	It was just basically Skyrim.
2462100	2469020	I played a little bit of Pokemon Go, just to, you know, I don't know, for some reason,
2469020	2474500	kill time, because I'm in my car and driving relatively slow through an area that's full
2474500	2475500	of Poke stops.
2475500	2477380	You had to get a party Pikachu.
2477380	2481060	I had to get a party Pikachu, but they don't have party Pikachus, because apparently Niantic's
2481060	2487740	like, hey, we're going to release this Pikachu hat thing, and now we're going to make Pikachu
2487740	2489940	never spawn ever again.
2489940	2495300	I finally got my two Pikachus today, and I say two because one, I have to evolve to Raichu.
2495300	2498860	I just had to drive around the neighborhood and just pull over at every Poke stop I knew
2498860	2500380	of in every park.
2500380	2505940	And finally, at one of the parks where there's a gym, there was a party Pikachu, and then
2505940	2509660	as I was giving up, I was like, all right, I'm just going to have the one, I just won't
2509660	2510740	have a Raichu, whatever.
2510740	2514680	As I was driving home, at my home park here, it was on the radar.
2514680	2517020	There was another party Pikachu, and I was like, yes.
2517020	2519620	So I was able to get my Pikachus.
2519620	2520620	Party.
2520620	2521620	Party.
2521620	2525900	But then, yeah, in Skyrim, I've been just doing the quest lines.
2525900	2531700	So I finished the Thieves Guild stuff, which those radiant quests are fucking stupid.
2531700	2533060	I'm so glad I'm done with that.
2533060	2537580	And the fact that they had that actually based, you know, one of the achievements is based
2537580	2542820	on doing like 20 of those was annoying, because they weren't hard at all.
2542820	2547900	It was just annoying, because it's random, and you have to do five in each of the holds.
2547900	2551980	And once you get down to that last hold, it's like, all right, I got to quit this.
2551980	2552980	Do it again.
2552980	2553980	Quit it.
2553980	2554980	Do it again.
2554980	2555980	Quit it.
2555980	2556980	Do it again.
2556980	2557980	Quit it.
2557980	2558980	Oh, I finally got one for the hold I need.
2558980	2559980	It was just irritating.
2559980	2566140	And then, of course, I also finished the Mages College quest line as well.
2566140	2568700	So I'm just going through some of that stuff.
2568700	2572900	So next, I'll be doing the Dark Brotherhood, and maybe I'll finally do the mainline stuff.
2572900	2573900	I don't know.
2573900	2574900	But, yeah.
2574900	2575900	That's it.
2575900	2577260	All right.
2577260	2581180	My gaming week, up until Friday, was pretty much a lot of the same old stuff I've been
2581180	2586540	playing, like Final Fantasy XIV still, Overwatch, playing a little bit of that still, trying
2586540	2591300	to get my loot box bonuses, forcing myself to play capture the flag mode, even though
2591300	2592300	I really don't like it.
2592300	2596460	But I did it once on PlayStation 4 and once on PC to get my extra loot boxes.
2596460	2601220	So I kind of found that if I do Lucio and capture the flag, I don't feel so freaking
2601220	2604340	useless because I'm healing.
2604340	2606300	I'm decent enough with Lucio.
2606300	2610140	I just can't really screw around with characters that are just fun to play right now.
2610140	2612100	I like playing Sombra for fun.
2612100	2613980	I'm not really good with her.
2613980	2614980	Same thing with Ana.
2614980	2617300	I like playing Ana for fun, even though I'm not really good with her.
2617300	2621180	But Lucio, the nice thing is the healing thing is more like an aura, so you don't really
2621180	2622180	have to think...
2622180	2625380	He's kind of a little easier to play for that, so I feel like I'm more effective playing
2625380	2627500	with Lucio.
2627500	2631820	But then the other character I find that I'm getting better and better with, who I really
2631820	2635900	didn't like at first, but now as I'm playing with her more, I'm really getting to like
2635900	2640300	her is Mei, because I keep getting her in Mystery Heroes, and I can actually stay alive
2640300	2642820	as Mei for a little while.
2642820	2647980	Just being the covert Mei that everybody freaking hates coming up behind people, freeze!
2647980	2648980	And then...
2648980	2649980	I want to cosplay.
2649980	2650980	I'm going to cosplay her.
2651780	2652780	You should.
2652780	2653780	I'm going to cosplay her.
2653780	2654780	It's a cute outfit.
2654780	2655780	In the winter.
2655780	2657180	In the winter, yes.
2657180	2658180	So that was that.
2658180	2660700	And then of course, Friday, Nintendo Switch.
2660700	2663460	So I've been playing this weekend.
2663460	2665500	Just a little bit of fast racing remix.
2665500	2669700	I just jumped into that just a little bit, probably not enough to really talk about impressions
2669700	2674460	except for, yes, it's fast, and it looks very nice.
2674460	2678380	I can tell it's a little better than the Wii U one, even though not like a huge difference,
2678380	2679380	but you know, enough.
2679860	2682700	But then I've been spending a lot of time this weekend with Zelda Breath of the Wild,
2682700	2687580	which you know, it really is a pretty tremendous game.
2687580	2691780	I mean, it's just, the scope of the game is gigantic.
2691780	2695620	Like you just don't even really believe it at first, because you start in this one little
2695620	2699140	area and you're like, oh, okay, this is like going to be the world that I'm playing in
2699140	2700140	right here.
2700140	2703300	And then you realize, oh no, that's just one little blip on the giant map.
2703300	2706260	It's like, oh shit.
2706260	2710740	The interesting thing about Breath of the Wild that I'm finding is the whole, like,
2710740	2714340	how there's more than one way to solve a puzzle type of thing.
2714340	2716780	That's very, very interesting.
2716780	2721340	And I know there's a lot that's inspired by Zelda 1, because you might remember from the
2721340	2725900	original original Zelda, the original Zelda didn't handhold you a whole lot.
2725900	2728860	You kind of had to go find level one, obviously level one's easy.
2728860	2730780	You had to go find level two, find level three.
2730780	2731780	You could play them out of order.
2731780	2732780	Yeah, you could.
2732780	2733780	Well...
2733780	2734780	Mostly.
2734780	2735780	Mostly.
2736300	2737300	You could play out of order.
2737300	2738300	There were a couple you could play out of order.
2738300	2741620	Like usually you would like, you have to get the raft to go to the next level and then
2741620	2742620	you get...
2742620	2747060	There's some like that, but there are a few, like I would think the first three, you don't
2747060	2748620	need anything.
2748620	2749620	Maybe bombs.
2749620	2750940	No, you need bombs to beat some of the bosses.
2750940	2751940	But anyway, like...
2751940	2756660	You can go through the whole game without the sword until you get to the last level.
2756660	2757660	Yes.
2757660	2759060	And there are different ways to exploit it and so forth.
2759060	2764400	So you know, and how did we, especially in the second quest of Zelda, where it's like
2764400	2769580	you had to burn the fucking right tree or bomb just the right rock to find levels.
2769580	2773380	Like you had to really talk to people and compare notes to figure these things out.
2773380	2778180	And I see a lot of this in this Zelda game as well, except there might not necessarily
2778180	2780940	be just one way to do it.
2780940	2784520	Like I was talking a little bit about this on Bobby's show.
2784520	2787800	One way to survive the cold might be to cook a meal.
2787800	2789100	That's how I did it.
2789100	2790820	Or you can find an item.
2790820	2794440	That's how Shane did it when we were comparing notes talking on the phone.
2794440	2798240	We might be to skin an enemy and wear his skin and coat.
2798240	2801760	You have to cook their teeth and do an elixir or something.
2801760	2806760	There's different ways to solve the problem, which kind of throws you off at first because
2806760	2810940	sometimes we're used to video games being so linear that there's only one way, one solution
2810940	2811940	to the problem.
2811940	2813460	But Zelda is really not like that.
2813460	2818960	And even Zelda, once you complete the beginning area, the little, I guess, tutorial area,
2818960	2823620	for lack of a better term, once you beat that little area, you can go straight to the castle
2823620	2825220	and try to beat the game.
2825220	2829940	It's probably not going to go well for you, but theoretically you're supposed to be able
2829940	2831540	to go to the castle and do what you need to do.
2831540	2835680	I just, I don't know if it would really be possible without ultimate precision, but that's
2835680	2840340	going to be the real fun to watch speed runners do later on.
2840340	2843180	So anyway, yeah, there's just, there's more than one way to do things.
2843180	2849040	And so, yeah, you really just kind of sit back and just enjoy the ride and just exploring
2849040	2850240	these different areas.
2850240	2854720	And there's that very Skyrim element to it where it's like in Skyrim, it's, oh, there's
2854720	2855760	this side dungeon.
2855760	2856760	What's going to be in here?
2856760	2858800	Well, now it's, oh, there's this shrine.
2858800	2863440	What's going to be over in here and, oh, I can chop down this tree or pick these plants
2863440	2865680	or what can I cook?
2865680	2867600	What do you mean nobody's going to tell me what to cook?
2867600	2868820	Like I just have to figure it out.
2868820	2873040	If I mix these ingredients together, I'm going to get this, or I compare notes with friends
2873040	2874500	or I go online.
2874500	2877180	That's part of the Breath of the Wild experience.
2877180	2884480	But it's, it's, I think it is a truly an amazing accomplishment of a game.
2884480	2885880	Probably going to be the game of the year.
2885880	2887620	I should have put that in the time capsule.
2887620	2891260	So a Zelda game of the year, because it probably already is.
2891260	2895620	And the interesting thing to me is that honestly, I think probably the way I would describe
2895620	2901180	Zelda Breath of the Wild is it's probably the best video game of the last generation
2901180	2903120	because it is a Wii U game after all.
2903120	2905920	It's the best video game of the last generation.
2905920	2907780	It's probably where this game is going to end up.
2907780	2911440	So it's an interesting, interesting way to kick off the Switch.
2911440	2916080	But yeah, I mean, it's a stellar, stellar game and you don't even, I don't even think
2916080	2920480	you need to be a huge Zelda fan to be into it because it doesn't really play a lot like
2920480	2921680	the other Zeldas to me.
2921680	2924780	I've always been a little eh with 3D Zeldas.
2924780	2927240	Like I didn't get into Ocarina of Time the way everybody did.
2927240	2930480	I know that's like sacrilege in some circles, but I didn't get into that.
2930480	2933140	Yeah, the only one I've ever gotten into was Wind Waker.
2933140	2936380	Uh, I liked Wind Waker HD and Twilight Princess on the Wii.
2936380	2939700	I don't know if that was just the novelty of the Wii or all that, but that Twilight
2939700	2943660	Princess kind of held my attention for a while for the 3D Zeldas and I really enjoyed that
2943660	2944660	when it came out.
2944660	2945660	But yeah.
2945660	2947580	Uh, let's see.
2947580	2953060	Looking in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com, Dark Tetsuya says the reviews I've seen it's
2953060	2954900	getting nines and tens all over the place.
2954900	2955900	Yeah.
2955900	2957540	I mean, honestly it, it deserves it.
2957540	2961280	And Dark Tetsuya says, yeah, speedrunners have a really weird order of doing the dungeons.
2961280	2965760	Like if I recall correctly, they start with level three probably in the original Zelda.
2965760	2966760	Probably.
2966760	2967760	They probably do.
2967760	2968760	Uh, come on.
2968760	2973960	No Gus in chat says, I wish I could find like 20 arrows at a time instead of just five.
2973960	2975840	There are places you can buy arrows.
2975840	2980800	So my question is, because this looked absolutely annoying when I saw them talking about it,
2980800	2982180	is the weapon durability.
2982180	2984160	Is that fucking annoying?
2984160	2985160	Yes.
2985160	2986680	I don't have an, I don't have a nice way to say it.
2986680	2987680	Yes.
2987680	2988680	It's very annoying.
2988680	2989680	Did you get the lightsaber yet?
2989680	2990680	No.
2990680	2991680	It's not the lightsaber.
2991680	2992680	It's called like the guardian sword.
2992680	2993680	Oh yes.
2993680	2994680	That I had, I had it for like five seconds.
2994680	2995680	And then it broke.
2995680	2996680	Yeah.
2996680	2997680	Or the, what?
2997680	2998680	The eightfold sword.
2998680	2999680	Yeah.
2999680	3000680	That one was awesome.
3000680	3001680	And it, it broke like five seconds later.
3001680	3004080	The durability on the weapons is not so hot.
3004080	3008760	And I, I don't know if there's a, because the, see, I got to watch my spoiler.
3008760	3011360	So I'm going to really try to speak in vague terms.
3011360	3015820	One of the other complaints I had in the beginning of the game was you can't even hold more than
3015820	3020740	like four shields and with as fast as all these things break, what the F am I going
3020740	3021740	to do?
3021740	3022940	Like this is, this is crazy talk.
3022940	3028300	Well, it turns out there are ways to work with that later on.
3028300	3030820	So I'm hoping the weapon thing is the same thing.
3030820	3036000	I could swear somebody was saying something on Twitter about that there is either you
3036000	3039940	buy them or there's like a blacksmith who helps you make stronger ones.
3039940	3042120	So maybe some of those issues will be resolved later on.
3042120	3043660	I just haven't found the answer to that yet.
3043660	3044660	And it is annoying.
3044660	3048020	You should get that out of the game in the first place because weapon durability is just
3048020	3052060	an artificial way to inflate the length of the game.
3052060	3055260	Well, yes and no, I would say yes to that.
3055260	3060620	If the game didn't hand out new weapons like candy, like the monsters will drop weapons
3060620	3063980	and you can pick that weapon up and beat the shit out of them with that weapon.
3063980	3068340	And, and that's that in some case with their own arm and yes, in some cases with their
3068340	3069340	own arm.
3069340	3073740	Um, and that, that also, by the way, that whole thing is really part of what makes this
3073740	3078940	Zelda game quite tremendous is that like the detail that goes into that, like when
3078940	3084620	you go and if you actually like pick up a weapon that's a monster was using, they'll
3084620	3087500	actually point and go, what are you doing?
3087500	3088500	Like that whole time.
3088500	3091980	And they go, they scream at you like they throw it straight into their eyes.
3091980	3094860	And that's when you throw it straight into their eye or you throw a bomb at them or something
3094860	3095860	like that.
3095860	3101340	And just, yeah, like the detail on the monsters and the way they kind of react to different
3101340	3102340	situations.
3102340	3106800	Like you could kind of watch them for a while and it's, it's, it's pretty neat.
3106800	3108980	Like the level of detail that goes into that.
3108980	3114300	So, uh, bonds double 06 says, so it's like border land, Zelda version.
3114300	3117820	Um, that's not some Assassin's Creed, not too far off.
3117820	3120360	It's that Borderlands is smart and didn't have weapon durability.
3120360	3123340	So they win, uh, come on.
3123340	3125740	No Gus says there's such a limited inventory though.
3125740	3128820	It's just weird having to drop something to pick something else up.
3128820	3130420	Yeah, it is a little weird.
3130420	3133740	At least the materials don't seem to be limited on inventory.
3133740	3139040	So I can pick up all the apples and plants and all that crap to my heart's content.
3139040	3141720	It really just seems to be the weapons and shields and that type of stuff.
3141720	3145500	So, but, uh, I'm enjoying it so far and I definitely want to play more of it.
3145500	3147740	Um, that will probably fill my gaming time.
3147740	3150060	Uh, although I don't know, a blaster master zero next week.
3150060	3151060	I'm really looking forward to that.
3151060	3152820	And I really hope that game doesn't let me down.
3152820	3157340	Um, but then there's mass effect in three weeks, so we'll see.
3157340	3158340	Anyway.
3158340	3159340	All right.
3159340	3160620	So that was my gaming week.
3160620	3165220	Let's get to, uh, some housekeeping, visit on Twitter, twitter.com slash O L R. We're
3165220	3168620	also on Facebook, facebook.com slash orange lounge radio.
3168620	3172420	Um, I don't think we have any shows scheduled off for a bit.
3172420	3175420	Uh, we'll, we'll still be here over the next few weeks.
3175420	3177480	Um, yeah, I can't think of it.
3177480	3180860	There's no, uh, expos I can think of that we're doing, uh, that I'm going to be gone
3180860	3185020	all weekend except for the SAC indie arcade is, is starting to sneak up on us.
3185020	3186160	That's April 8th.
3186160	3188820	So that's like a month away at this point.
3188820	3189820	Wow.
3189820	3190820	And now I'm working on Saturdays.
3190820	3191820	Oh no.
3191820	3195020	You don't have to be able to do it with us.
3195020	3196020	Oh shit.
3196020	3197020	I didn't even think of that.
3197020	3199700	Not unless I can come up, figure something out.
3199700	3200700	All right.
3200700	3203700	Well at least Loki and I'll be, Oh, you hope you're there or we're going to have room.
3203700	3204700	I got to get away from the kids.
3204700	3205700	Yes.
3205700	3206700	I'll be there.
3206700	3209540	The only two Saturdays that I were able to get off for to go see drag queens.
3209540	3214060	Well, I'm seeing Bianca Del Rio and I'm going to the thing that they canceled in December
3214060	3216660	or because of all the weather.
3216660	3219140	Well, we'll, we'll see, we'll see.
3219140	3223180	Hopefully our soccer can make it, but if not, it's April 8th is the, uh, indie arcade and
3223180	3225340	Loki and I'll, we'll be there for sure.
3225340	3229140	Hopefully our soccer or we'll have to get a stand in, uh, for that day.
3229140	3230140	See what happens.
3230140	3231140	Yeah.
3231140	3232940	Uh, we'll be broadcasting from the event over in West Sacramento.
3232940	3235700	Uh, so we had a lot of fun doing that the past couple of years.
3235700	3237860	So I'm really looking forward to this year as well.
3237860	3242100	Uh, so look forward to that, but otherwise I'm not traveling for anything until like
3242100	3243100	dragon cons.
3243100	3244100	The first thing on my agenda.
3244540	3247900	I don't think I have, Oh, mag West is supposed to be a thing too.
3247900	3250460	That's technically the week before dragon con.
3250460	3253100	Um, but I don't have all the details on mag West yet.
3253100	3255620	So two more to come on that.
3255620	3257660	Let's get into some other gaming news.
3257660	3261380	There's still a lot that happened this week outside of GDC and the switch, right?
3261380	3262380	Yeah, there was.
3262380	3265900	And then I was actually kind of surprised cause I was doing research on other stuff
3265900	3270200	when I read this and I was like, Holy shit, this is pretty awesome.
3270200	3273420	So Microsoft announced this Xbox game pass.
3273420	3279140	It's a nine 99 a month service for Xbox one and PC that allows you to play a rotating
3279140	3285060	catalog of downloadable, um, Xbox one and backwards compatible Xbox three 60 games.
3285060	3290460	I didn't even realize you can play the Xbox three 60 games on the PC.
3290460	3291460	I didn't eat.
3291460	3294860	Well, you can do the whole streaming thing from your Xbox one.
3294860	3295940	I have done that.
3295940	3299460	I was playing dungeon siege three that way cause they were getting that away at one point
3299460	3301900	how that works with some of these other ones, you know, whatever.
3301900	3303280	Um, what the case may be.
3303280	3309520	So basically it's a rotating, a catalog of a hundred titles from all different publishers,
3309520	3315580	a two K Capcom, Sega Bandai Namco, THQ, deep silver, you know, blah, blah, blah.
3315580	3319880	And some of the games they're kind of showing in their little graphic here, they have like
3319880	3327760	halo five saints row, four mad max NBA, two K 16, uh, Lego Batman three, you know, it
3327760	3329760	looks like some pretty decent titles.
3329760	3335980	Um, it's going to be, you know, cycled out each month, so there'll be titles that rotate
3335980	3336980	out of there.
3336980	3343600	Um, it is basically said it's, um, I don't think you need to have Xbox live gold, but
3343600	3349520	if you do have gold, you get, um, you can get to try this out before it actually launches.
3349520	3354320	And then along with that too, they're going to be offering DLC a little bit cheaper if
3354320	3355520	you do subscribe to this.
3355520	3359700	So you'll be getting discounts off of, um, I think also probably full purchases of games
3359700	3360920	as well.
3360920	3366040	But honestly that is way better than fucking PlayStation now, as far as I'm concerned.
3366040	3370000	Well, I was about to ask, what's the difference between the two, but PlayStation now is all
3370000	3371920	PlayStation three and older stuff, right?
3371920	3373720	There's nothing newer on it, right?
3373720	3374720	Older games.
3374720	3377160	And this is not streaming.
3377160	3378160	This is downloading.
3378160	3379160	Yeah.
3379160	3380160	Okay.
3380160	3382800	So you can download it and play it off your hard drive and you don't need to be connected.
3382800	3387360	In fact, I believe they said, you know, you just need to connect once a month to, you
3387360	3389800	know, keep utilizing those games.
3389800	3391120	I think that's fantastic.
3391120	3395520	That's the perfect Netflix way to address that.
3395520	3398520	Why Sony hasn't done that beyond me.
3398520	3402320	I mean, I think this is how they should treat, you know, well, this is going to light a fire
3402320	3403320	for Sony to respond.
3403320	3408120	That'll be definitely, they've been like kicking ass as far as backwards compatibility support.
3408120	3412760	And now this service, I think that's pretty, that's a great revenue source and hello.
3412760	3418720	Fucking Nintendo, dude, you have this catalog of like hundreds of virtual console games.
3418720	3421400	You can't tell me you can't put out a service like this.
3421400	3423680	Are you saying that your games are worse, more than this shit?
3423680	3429640	I mean, to be fair, we don't know yet because virtual console, they might, I highly doubt
3429640	3430640	it.
3430640	3435220	I say that as I'm holding back laughter, but they technically Loki, we don't know.
3435220	3438440	Technically we don't know because virtual console is now yet and they haven't announced
3438440	3442240	what the virtual plan, a console plans are on the switch yet specifically.
3442240	3446860	So they could do a Netflix style model still, and we don't know about it, but I know we're
3446860	3450040	all kind of looking at it going, well, we all know what's going to happen to Rob.
3450040	3453780	It's going to be five bucks again, unless maybe you get a credit for owning it before
3453780	3457840	you can upgrade to a dollar and maybe the new little thing is that it has online.
3457840	3463080	I think that's what we're all anticipating, but Hey, if this whole move that Microsoft
3463080	3467760	is doing forces Nintendo to do a response, I kind of think Nintendo doesn't, I kind of
3467760	3471720	think Nintendo can get away with doing what they've been doing as far as virtual console
3471720	3472720	goes.
3472720	3478680	I, I, I'm not thrilled about it either, but I, I think Nintendo can get away with it and
3478680	3479680	they will.
3479680	3482200	Of course they will.
3482200	3486160	So and I probably am, aren't helping because I'll probably buy a lot of those games, at
3486160	3487320	least the ones I want to play again.
3487320	3490080	See now this won't be something that I'll be picking up, right?
3490080	3493300	You know, well I don't have an Xbox one, so it's definitely not something to be paying
3493300	3497160	for right away, but it might be something I'd be interested in maybe.
3497160	3502400	Although then again, I do have a back catalog of over, you know, 200 games or about 200
3502400	3506440	games on the PlayStation and 500 games on Steam.
3506440	3510560	Yeah, I probably should play through some of those first before I'm getting more older
3510560	3511560	games.
3511560	3514600	And plus a lot of these that are showing in the rotation there were included in those
3514600	3520440	like, you know, PlayStation plus, um, the Xbox live games of gold and stuff like that.
3520440	3523120	So I may already have those in my catalog.
3523120	3528660	Like I have NBA two K 16 on PlayStation, not that I'm really interested in playing it,
3528660	3529660	but I've got it.
3529660	3530660	Saints are a four.
3530660	3533160	I bought, you know, Halo five would be fun.
3533160	3537080	I think where this is going to really prove itself useful is that like, let's say you
3537080	3543820	buy like a grand kid or a kid or whatever, like their first Xbox one console or something.
3543820	3548180	This is a great way to have like an instant library of games to like catch up on stuff.
3548180	3552540	I think that's where this is going to really, and it's probably where Microsoft's being
3552540	3558480	smart with it because they want to lure more people and new people into Microsoft's, uh,
3558480	3559580	you know, library.
3559580	3562020	So this is a, this is a really neat way.
3562020	3563020	And look at it this way.
3563020	3568580	If you're like budget conscious, $10 a month is really not all that much.
3568580	3569580	Not that bad.
3569580	3570580	That's like lunch.
3570580	3571700	I mean, that's, it's really not that bad.
3571700	3575740	And I mean, if you're not looking to play like the newest, greatest thing.
3575740	3576740	How much is the EA thing?
3576740	3580500	Isn't the eighth EA thing like 20 is like much more than that.
3580500	3582220	I want to say it's at least like 20 bucks.
3582220	3583660	Does somebody in chat know the answer to that?
3583660	3584660	How much is the EA thing?
3584660	3588420	Yeah, I can look it up, but I want to see there's as much more than that.
3588420	3592920	And that's kind of, I would assume no EA games on this service because EA wants you to use
3592920	3595460	their more expensive thing for the EA game.
3595460	3596980	I don't see EA on there.
3596980	3600860	Um, I do see everybody else, but EA.
3600860	3601860	What a shot.
3601860	3603700	I don't care, honestly.
3603700	3605700	Not missing it.
3605700	3607300	All right.
3607300	3609260	Uh, Jamie checking in with you real quick.
3609260	3616300	Do you think there's a market for this type of Netflix style Xbox gaming thing?
3616300	3617300	I guess.
3617300	3623900	I mean, Netflix itself came really popular and killed Blockbuster.
3623900	3628220	Netflix has the, even though we keep saying it's Netflix of games and stuff, it's like,
3628220	3632900	it's the old Netflix of games because now I think Netflix has enough of its own original
3632900	3633900	stuff.
3633900	3637260	And that's, Netflix kind of knew it to their credit, kind of knew they had to go there.
3637260	3639780	It's $4.99.
3639780	3641340	The EA thing is only $4.99?
3641340	3642900	$4.99 a month.
3642900	3643900	Okay.
3643900	3649500	Well, $4.99 a month, one publisher versus $9.99 a month, a lot of publishers.
3649500	3652100	Well, Stan corrected and apologized to EA.
3652100	3654240	I thought it was a lot more money when I went in there and looked.
3654240	3657780	Maybe I was looking at some type of like three month pricing or something, but I'm okay with
3657780	3658780	it.
3658780	3662740	I mean, it'd be interesting, but I think a lot of people still like, you know, owning
3662740	3664660	their thing too.
3664660	3665660	That's very true.
3665660	3667540	$4.99 a year.
3667540	3670140	Oh, maybe that was something I was looking at.
3670140	3671140	All right.
3671140	3672140	Anyway.
3672140	3677820	Um, still, I don't know if I myself would buy something like this, you know, just because
3677820	3682620	I'm kind of like where, what Jamie said is that some people kind of like to own it and
3682620	3686220	I feel like the games that are going to be in this are not going to be the newest stuff,
3686220	3688660	which is usually going to be the stuff that I'm going to end up buying anyway.
3688660	3694140	It's kind of like, I don't know, you know, when I was back, back when I had like the
3694140	3699060	NES and the super NES, I was not all gung ho about owning stuff.
3699060	3702300	It was just renting it then playing it and then being done with it.
3702300	3706620	I think there's a lot of games that you could just get that experience where you just burned
3706620	3708580	through it and then you're done with it.
3708580	3710580	There's not a lot of replayability on them.
3710580	3712220	That's a good point.
3712220	3713220	We'll see.
3713220	3716980	Uh, bonds, double O six and chat over at live.vog network.com says they won't get money for
3716980	3717980	me.
3717980	3718980	I'm sorry.
3718980	3722260	Ninty and Sony 59 a year is enough for online features.
3722260	3726740	Brad from pod culture pointing out Blockbuster killed Blockbuster, unnecessary 100 Matt saying,
3726740	3731960	I'm sure come there E3 direct, we will know hopefully a lot more.
3731960	3732960	So we'll see.
3732960	3737300	Um, I, it sounds very interesting and I'd like to know exactly, you know, what that
3737300	3741260	list of games is going to ultimately end up being when it first comes out.
3741260	3745220	Um, I don't know if there's, I'm kind of like you, Loki, I have a big enough backlog as
3745220	3750740	it is like, I would be, I would be amazed with myself if I actually am able to take
3750740	3753860	the time to beat Zelda breath of the wild before something else comes out.
3753860	3754860	Yeah.
3754860	3756460	And I already have like a few EA tiles.
3756460	3760440	Like I was looking at the other day, I was like, maybe I should install need for speed
3760440	3762860	on my system or dragon age inquisition.
3762860	3768980	I have these like games today, my catalog, they just haven't played to register participation
3768980	3772280	for this week's episode of orange lounge radio at vog network.com.
3772280	3773940	Use the passphrase trunk.
3773940	3777880	All right, well moving on, let's get back to the switch for a minute because there's
3777880	3779660	some other things going on.
3779700	3782940	Maybe not just necessarily in the U S with the switch, you know, we talked a little bit
3782940	3786780	about the U S has switched lineup, but, uh, in other countries, the lineup is a little
3786780	3787780	bit different.
3787780	3793600	And, uh, on the switch over in Japan, there's a game called voice or voice.
3793600	3798500	I think it might be pronounced like voice or something voice, uh, it's V O E Z is the
3798500	3799500	game.
3799500	3800500	It's a rhythm music game.
3800500	3805460	So right up our alley here at, uh, O L R there's 116 songs in this game and it's in Japan with
3805460	3808380	the console's launch, but yours was interesting about the game.
3808380	3810740	You can't play it in TV mode.
3810740	3813780	The game is only for tablet mode.
3813780	3817860	The reason why, because it's a touch screen music game.
3817860	3820580	And when you're on the TV, there's no touch screen.
3820580	3822680	There's no more infrared sensor bar or whatever.
3822680	3826780	So you can't even really use motion controllers like a pseudo mouse or something like that
3826780	3827780	to emulate touchscreen.
3827780	3828780	I know.
3828780	3829780	Right.
3829780	3830780	So that's gone.
3830780	3835100	So, uh, interesting that there are going to be games available on switch that will only
3835100	3836660	be in the tablet mode.
3836660	3840860	And you do see this, like even if you're browsing through the eShop, there's little icons that
3840860	3844220	show you in what modes the game is playable.
3844220	3846620	And one of them is the dock with the controller.
3846620	3850540	One of them is just the two joy cons disconnected with the screen.
3850540	3853480	And then the other is with the joy cons attached to the screen.
3853480	3857380	So there's different icons that show up and pretty much everything out that's in the U
3857380	3858940	S market supports all of them.
3858940	3860940	So you don't even really notice it.
3860940	3864560	Maybe if you own one, two switch, there's some mini games that will give you a sense
3864560	3868440	of this, how not everything can be done in every configuration.
3868440	3873620	But it is interesting that here we have a launch title nonetheless that won't play in
3873620	3875240	one of the configurations.
3875240	3881240	So it probably won't be the last of the switch titles to require the touch pad.
3881240	3886720	Kind of interesting, but, um, yeah, I, I don't know again, how many games in the future are
3886720	3890480	going to plan to do this, but, uh, we could see a few.
3890480	3896120	So, um, I have not seen a lot of this game, but since it is a music game, I'm already
3896120	3897400	interested a little bit.
3897400	3903920	I do know it has a TBD date for the U S but if you really wanted to get this game again,
3903920	3907400	because the Nintendo switch is region free, you can just make an account, you just make
3907400	3911600	a second account on your system and set it to Japan or Europe.
3911600	3914880	If you want to check out their store, obviously you have to pick a country, but you know,
3914880	3918280	set it to Germany or, or, you know, something like that.
3919060	3923080	And then you can go into their store and get their demos and their games and what have
3923080	3925000	you. And apparently it's like really easy to do.
3925000	3929640	I've even seen people on my friends list that have stuff from the arcade archives, the Neo
3929640	3931840	geo stuff that's out in Japan.
3931840	3932840	That's not out here.
3932840	3934120	I don't know if it was wild arms or something.
3934120	3935120	I don't know what it was.
3935120	3939340	Is that stuff like integrate with all your other games on like your little home screen
3939340	3942320	or does that going to be different based on which account you're logged into?
3942320	3945800	No, uh, then once you go back to your U S account, the game shows up there and it shows
3945800	3949960	up in your, like, uh, the, the person I'm thinking of is captain spike from game buoy.
3949960	3955160	If I go into his profile, you can see that he has the ACA Neo geo stuff right in there
3955160	3957680	with Zelda one, two switch, whatever else he's playing.
3957680	3962640	That's like, um, PlayStation, I think did that or something.
3962640	3963640	Someone did it.
3963640	3964640	Yeah.
3964640	3965640	I think it was PlayStation.
3965640	3966640	Yeah.
3966640	3968400	So the region free is working very well, which does kind of beg the question.
3968400	3975640	So why are we waiting so long to get voice here in the U S does that like English language
3975640	3976640	support?
3976640	3979760	Apparently you don't need to really understand, uh, Japan.
3979760	3980760	Oh yeah.
3980760	3983080	The game does have English language support apparently.
3983080	3984920	So there's really, yeah, I know.
3984920	3985920	Right.
3985920	3987580	Is it, could it be a music license thing?
3987580	3992100	I don't know if these 116 songs, if any of them are like, you know, Britney Spears type
3992100	3993100	of thing.
3993100	3994100	So there's music.
3994100	3995100	I can't imagine.
3995100	4000000	This sounds like a smaller indie title that long to new sharp licensing in other countries.
4000000	4001000	I would think.
4001000	4002000	Yeah.
4002000	4003000	I don't know.
4003000	4004000	So, Hmm.
4004000	4005000	Uh, interesting.
4005000	4006000	Uh, let's see.
4006000	4010760	Brad from pod culture says, uh, I'm calling it by the time switch to arrives the console
4010760	4012760	and the handheld will be one biz.
4012760	4014440	No more game boy slash DS.
4014440	4018120	You're going to have to wait for the next time capsule next year, Brad.
4018120	4019480	All right.
4019480	4022160	Anyhow, uh, we'll keep you up to date.
4022160	4026120	I'm not really going to go and make a Japanese account just to get this game.
4026120	4030040	Um, cause there's plenty else to play right now, but I will be curious to check it out
4030040	4033960	when it does come out in the U S meanwhile, dark Sakura.
4033960	4036680	Another game we're looking forward to at least you and I are, even if everybody else
4036680	4039920	has some soft core space porn.
4039920	4040920	Okay.
4040920	4043760	Well, it's just mass effect Andromeda.
4043760	4048160	I mean, but we knew that there was going to be alien stripping going on.
4048160	4049160	Right.
4049160	4060040	So, um, there was a, uh, a post by Aaron Flynn, um, regarding, um, the, uh, uh, rating for
4060040	4061040	a mass effect Andromeda.
4061040	4066000	And there was the note that said, remember we lost the partial nudity rating and got
4066000	4067480	full nudity.
4067480	4073560	Um, so basically he's just going back and forth with the, with the fans and pretty much
4073560	4074560	responded.
4074560	4075560	Yes.
4075560	4076560	It's totally soft core space porn.
4076560	4077560	It could be a joke.
4077560	4079560	So that means we could get alien Dick.
4079560	4083560	There's well, I don't know if it's going to be Dick or, or Bush or anything.
4083560	4085200	I think it's going to be dead ass.
4085200	4086720	We have alien twat.
4086720	4089720	Like we had an, well, like in dragon age with Dorian, right?
4089720	4091480	Was Dorian the only one that had booty?
4091480	4092480	No.
4092480	4094360	But like you totally saw ass.
4094360	4095360	There was ass.
4095360	4097600	Well you did actually in the first mass effect.
4097600	4099040	Was there ass in the first mass effect?
4099040	4101160	Um, for the lady romance.
4101160	4103140	Oh, see, I never did the lady romance.
4103140	4107080	You got shepherd's butt or Liara's butt, depending on who you were going with.
4107080	4110320	Liara putting the ass in mass effect.
4110320	4115800	I actually did like on my little lol effect thing, I did three cheers for shepherd's butt
4115800	4118400	and posted shepherd's butt.
4118400	4126520	So yeah, but there was also, um, apparently some really steamy, steamy dialogue and one
4126520	4130360	that children shouldn't play under a certain age.
4130360	4136720	Um, so yeah, it's, it's going to be, uh, the rating is going to be a little bit more on
4136720	4138440	the adult level.
4138440	4144640	Um, and it's going to be, uh, giving into what fans want, which is alien shtipping.
4144640	4145640	Hooray.
4145640	4147640	I can't wait.
4147640	4152520	Uh, low key alien fucking isn't going to get you over to the mass effect franchise.
4152520	4153520	That's a gimmick.
4153520	4156480	I mean, I don't know.
4156480	4162360	Fucking on a unicorn might give me the play Witcher three, but it's just at the end of
4162360	4163360	the day, it's just a gimmick.
4163360	4167600	I mean, it's just, I don't know if the game's good.
4167600	4168600	Maybe.
4168600	4169600	I didn't play any of the other ones.
4169600	4172560	I just don't really feel the compulsion to play.
4172560	4173880	There's enough porn on the internet.
4173880	4174880	Okay.
4175240	4181000	I don't need to play a game strictly for the soft core pornography, which payoff porn.
4181000	4184600	I'm just going to say, remember the very first time I played mass effect, I wrote it off
4184600	4186080	and I was like, I don't, I'm not into this.
4186080	4187080	What is this?
4187080	4191960	And it wasn't until years later when Shane sat me down and said, no, you have to watch
4191960	4194440	this and made me watch on YouTube.
4194440	4200880	The Caden Shepard scene in mass effect three, I was like, I must play this game.
4200880	4202280	I must play this entire game.
4202320	4208360	I must lose 120 hours of my life to this franchise by playing it start to finish and a worth
4208360	4209360	it.
4209360	4210360	Thank you very much.
4210360	4211360	All right.
4211360	4216880	Uh, come on, no, Gus and chat says, I want Justin Trudeau to be a playable character
4216880	4219080	in ass effect.
4219080	4223400	The young Justin Trudeau, that's been making the rounds on a right on Twitter this week.
4223400	4225600	I knew he had to have been pretty when he was young.
4225600	4226600	Cause he's pretty now.
4226600	4230600	I was going to say, not that he's bad looking plank.
4230600	4235320	That means he's got core strength and that's important.
4235320	4238640	All right, moving on Loki, something that's not porn.
4238640	4242720	So Twitch is going to start selling games as well.
4242720	4247920	Basically what's going to happen is if you're playing a game, you can have it where a developer
4247920	4251840	can enable their game to be, um, sold on Twitch.
4251840	4256280	So like say you see someone playing Overwatch, you can purchase Overwatch, um, developers
4256280	4258360	are going to get 70% of the revenue.
4258360	4261600	Um, streamers will get 5% of that.
4261600	4266600	And then companies, I guess Ubisoft and telltale have already signed up.
4266600	4270420	They're saying though, the games bought on Twitch can be played through the Twitch launcher
4270420	4277200	through the developer slash publishers, existing services such as you play boo.
4277200	4279000	You play boo.
4279000	4280360	That's not a positive.
4280360	4283360	Nobody wants to play through you play ever.
4283360	4290000	Um, esteem an option because like, boo, why the fuck would I, I mean, I decided to give
4290000	4295040	money to the, the streamer, which is just throw them like a donation or something if
4295040	4296040	you're here and do that.
4296040	4297040	But fuck that.
4297040	4300040	I am not playing through you play for anything.
4300040	4301400	It's vital by Ubisoft games.
4301400	4303480	Here's the, here's the other question I have about all that.
4303480	4309800	Cause when I was first reading about it, it was only partnered streamers get that 5% kickback.
4309800	4313160	I don't know if they went back and changed it because I was like, yeah, it is only partnered
4313160	4314360	streamers.
4314360	4318120	So that's kind of a, that's kind of a dick.
4318120	4319120	Exactly.
4319120	4321780	Cause there's a lot of smaller streamers who aren't partnered.
4321780	4325280	Why do suddenly they lose out on this?
4325280	4328840	I don't understand that difference to drive that whole partnership thing.
4328840	4330280	Honestly, you know what?
4330280	4334840	5% revenue from something it's, you know what?
4334840	4335840	It's going to take a while.
4335840	4336840	I understand.
4336840	4339560	Do, do the YouTube thing where it's, well, don't totally do the YouTube thing cause YouTube
4339560	4342960	has its own issues, but the YouTube thing is what you don't get a check until you actually
4342960	4345840	make a hundred dollars in revenue type of thing and do that sort of thing for the smaller
4345840	4346840	people.
4346840	4350120	Then if they're, if they're worried about that, like there's going to be streamers that
4350120	4355400	just like don't ever make it, but it just, it just seems silly to, um, or just, you know,
4355400	4357200	it's Ubisoft and telltale games.
4357200	4360640	Do we really need to ha do you really need to purchase after Twitch?
4360640	4364200	Have you not heard of like telltale games or Ubisoft games?
4364200	4367000	Just fucking buy them through the respective platforms.
4367000	4368360	I mean, I don't know.
4368360	4369360	What's what's the point.
4369600	4373200	Do I still get my prime discount if I sell by the games this way?
4373200	4374200	Probably not.
4374200	4375200	Cause the prime discounts only when it's pre-orders.
4375200	4376200	Huh?
4376200	4377200	Does it work?
4377200	4378600	No, it does work for games that are already out, right?
4378600	4380280	I can't, I can't even remember.
4380280	4383120	It's been so long since I bought a game after it was already out, but I think when I bought
4383120	4384120	I think it's silly.
4384120	4390040	I mean like, uh, why would I like if I was going to buy a telltale game through like,
4390040	4394040	let's just say Twitch, okay, I'm gonna buy through Twitch.
4394040	4397800	I'd just go buy it through Amazon if I was really going to do that since it's the same
4397800	4398800	service anyways.
4398800	4400480	At least then I'd probably get steam code.
4400480	4403720	But don't you want to support your favorite streamer?
4403720	4404720	You know what?
4404720	4407760	There's a lot of ways to support my favorite streamer if I was going to do that.
4407760	4410880	And fucking, this is not needed is what it is.
4410880	4416600	It's not really needed because if I wanted to support them, what, 5% of a $20 game.
4416600	4417800	I mean, what is that?
4417800	4418800	Like a buck?
4418800	4419800	Yeah.
4419800	4420800	Throw them a dollar.
4420800	4424240	If you really want to do that or throw them, you can, and plus, plus if you donated or
4424240	4428680	subscribe to their channels, I'm like you get extra emoticons or whatever shit that
4428680	4430480	they incentivize people with.
4430480	4436160	I mean, I think that's more worthwhile than this nonsense where I have to play it through
4436160	4437160	you playing it.
4437160	4439240	I don't get steam code or some shit like that.
4439240	4440240	Fuck that.
4440240	4441780	No, I don't think so.
4441780	4446680	I've been trying to do more and more streaming lately and build up my presence over on Twitch.
4446680	4448160	Cheap plug, Rob Roberts.
4448160	4451560	I don't really do the whole donations thing because I don't, I'm still kind of weirded
4451560	4453120	out by the whole begging for money thing.
4453120	4454200	For me.
4454200	4457840	You do what works for you on your streams and the charity streams, of course, obviously
4457840	4459960	I think those are great and so forth.
4459960	4465840	I still have this weird area to like, do I want to make money off this?
4465840	4467440	How do I do it?
4467440	4472080	Feeling like I'm giving my viewers what they're paying for type of thing.
4472080	4476560	Long story short, if you want to support me, send me food.
4476560	4477560	I love food.
4477560	4478560	Send me cookies.
4478560	4482160	Send me, uh, I'll take Mountain Dew and Doritos.
4482160	4483160	Fuck.
4483160	4484160	I will.
4484160	4485160	Just send me food.
4485160	4489680	Or like in the case of this, like we're, let's say Girl Scout cookies are in season, Loki.
4489680	4493580	You can do the Samoas or whatever they call them now, but there'll always be Samoas.
4493580	4496980	Send me lots of Samoas.
4496980	4501400	Or just like put yourself, like get a partner link for Amazon and just fucking link that
4501400	4505880	shit in your channel instead and you probably more revenue from that stuff.
4505880	4508320	I mean, why, why would you do this?
4508320	4509320	I don't know.
4509320	4515760	It's just, the only way it makes sense to me is if it's just automatic.
4515760	4519760	Like it's like a thing that you can just tick a box or something like that and then when
4519760	4522240	you play those games that it just happens to do that.
4522240	4527780	But honestly, with the games that are streamed through Twitch, I don't think any of these
4527780	4531840	are at the top or even anywhere near at the top of the list.
4531840	4535960	Maybe, maybe with, um, you know, the new Ghost Recon game or something like that.
4535960	4541800	But yeah, that's kind of a stretch for the rest of those.
4541800	4542800	Let's see.
4542800	4547280	Uh, some folks in chat over at live.vognetwork.com JD says Girl Scout cookies just ended last
4547280	4548280	week.
4548280	4549280	Why you gotta go and ruin everything JD?
4549280	4553320	Why you gotta go, you gotta just, just take a big fat crap on this show.
4553320	4554880	No, I'm just kidding.
4554880	4559080	I, aren't they still trying, I know they're still trying to unload those cookies though.
4559080	4562320	I've been seeing the statuses on Facebook, like who wants to buy these cookies?
4562320	4565640	Uh, let's see, Brad from Paw Culture suggests Stroopwafel.
4565640	4569080	Oh, now I like that idea, the Stroopwafel.
4569080	4574040	Why not I could do a fund on Twitch to raise alcohol money.
4574040	4578920	That's like, it's, it's like that honest, it's that quote unquote honest beggar that
4578920	4583520	you see that says, you know, I just want to buy booze.
4583520	4586520	You know, I'm gonna, I'm gonna give that guy a dollar cause you know what, he's, he's honest
4586520	4588060	about what he's going for.
4588060	4590700	So maybe, maybe that's what I need to do on, on Twitch.
4590700	4592500	Just beg for alcohol money.
4592500	4597540	Uh, come on, Noel Gus suggests that, uh, I'd send Sky some socks.
4597540	4599220	Hey, you know, you know what?
4599220	4603900	I, socks are awesome, especially like those, like the designer cute socks that you get
4603900	4606060	like, like they have sock stores at the mall now.
4606060	4611920	I got these, the socks that I'm wearing right now are these weird, like my mother-in-law,
4611920	4617180	they went to, uh, Monterey and they brought me back socks for some reason.
4617180	4619900	And I was like, what socks?
4619900	4620980	I'm like, okay, thank you.
4620980	4621980	Thank you.
4621980	4622980	That's nice.
4622980	4626740	But those socks are fucking comfortable.
4626740	4628180	I wear them all the time.
4628180	4629180	They're fucking warm.
4629180	4632900	Those Donkey Kong socks from Vans are really cute.
4632900	4635900	They're not anything special, but man, they are fucking comfortable.
4635900	4637100	And why stop at socks?
4637100	4638300	Why not underwear too?
4638300	4641660	I mean, I'm not going to be able to show that off on Twitch cause that's a violation of
4641660	4644660	the terms of service and let's both be thankful for that.
4644660	4648860	But you and I'll know a little secret.
4648860	4652860	I'm gaming very comfortably this week.
4652860	4654860	All right.
4654860	4656180	I took it to an awkward place.
4656180	4657180	Sorry.
4657180	4662780	Let's go to a news about Overwatch, a game that a lot of people are playing on Twitch.
4662780	4665980	Are they going to be able to sell Overwatch on Twitch?
4665980	4666980	Depends on Blizzard.
4666980	4670220	I think, I think eventually they'll probably be like, fuck you guys.
4670220	4671220	We don't need you.
4671660	4673580	Overwatch sells itself.
4673580	4676820	Blizzard has revealed its latest character.
4676820	4682780	And as many people thought, the 11 year old girl that builds robots that they introduced
4682780	4688300	last week, Effie, she is not the new hero, but she built the robot.
4688300	4689300	Who is the hero?
4689300	4691540	The new hero is Orisa.
4691540	4693100	Orisa not Doomfist.
4693100	4699100	A lot of people said, oh, maybe Effie like did something where she was creating something
4699100	4700860	to help Doomfist or whatever.
4700860	4702340	No, it's actually the opposite.
4702340	4709540	Orisa was created to try to, I guess, stop Doomfist because Orisa was attacked by Doomfist.
4709540	4712180	And so that's kind of how she fits into the story.
4712180	4716660	I actually did play a little bit with Orisa on the test realm and I'm enjoying her as
4716660	4717660	a character.
4717660	4721660	She almost feels a little overpowered to me, but I think all new characters do at first.
4721660	4725300	I was getting into a Twitter discussion about it and I was like, man, her barrier is like
4725300	4726640	really strong.
4726640	4730620	But then one of my friends was like, how easy would it be as Junkrat to just fire bombs
4730620	4732580	right over the barrier or Pharah?
4732580	4734460	That barrier ain't going to do shit to a Pharah.
4734460	4736060	I was like, oh yeah, these are good points.
4736060	4739500	So, you know, people will be kind of thinking of the different counters to Orisa.
4739500	4743780	But Orisa is still fun to play and I think will be one of the more fun tank characters
4743780	4744780	to play.
4744780	4745780	So that's pretty cool.
4745780	4750200	Bastion just got a lot of changes too in the most recent update in Overwatch.
4750200	4754980	So yeah, Bastion, in fact, may be too powerful.
4754980	4758740	Some people complaining and bitching and moaning on the forums because that's what people do.
4758740	4765260	The Bastion is almost too powerful and you see Bastion in almost every game at this point.
4765260	4770220	So there was actually one of the directors, Jeff Kaplan, from Overwatch actually went
4770220	4773340	on to the Battle.net forum to kind of talk about what they were going to do with this.
4773340	4776860	He actually said, over the past few nights I've played with and against Bastion.
4776860	4779440	My perception is that he's a little too powerful right now.
4779440	4782660	In particular, in one match I was playing Bastion and the enemy Tracer was trying to
4782660	4783660	hunt me down.
4783660	4788060	The Tracer player was clearly a better player than I am, a very skilled individual.
4788060	4792400	I relied heavily on myself heal and the Tracer could not finish me off, but I was able to
4792400	4795500	kill Tracer in recon mode almost through attrition.
4795500	4797180	That part felt wrong to me.
4797180	4802300	So interesting that the director gets in there, plays the game and even recognizes, even though
4802300	4805540	he's the director, there's people at the game better than he is and that yeah, he should
4805540	4806900	have lost that particular round.
4806900	4811740	So I think they did make a small Bastion nerf in the most recently micro patch they just
4811740	4815660	rolled out in the past couple days and they may do some more fine tuning with Bastion.
4815980	4820620	But I mean the biggest thing they did is that Bastion's self heal you can use while moving
4820620	4824460	now and like you can pretty much like bring yourself back up to full health as you're
4824460	4825520	moving along the map.
4825520	4827940	So it's pretty crazy what he can do.
4827940	4831580	So I think they need to find like the right medium for that.
4831580	4833940	But that's what's going on in Overwatch.
4833940	4839100	So all right, moving on, DarkSakura.
4839100	4845020	Well something that I think would make, well first of all, number one, it's making me happy
4845020	4853460	and it would also make other fans of the series very happy is Danganronpa news, which
4853460	4856780	you haven't played any of them yet, have you?
4856780	4857780	No I have not.
4857780	4859860	I hear you talk about them all the time, but I haven't played them.
4859860	4868780	I got Shain in on it because he was wanting something to fill the, great now I can't think
4868780	4873100	of it, Phoenix Wright itch and so Danganronpa was it.
4873100	4879060	Anyway, Danganronpa V3 is going to be available on PC, they've confirmed.
4879060	4881340	Spike Chunsoft has confirmed.
4881340	4887860	So that means that it will be out on September 26th for that PS4 and Vita.
4887860	4894460	And Spike Chunsoft itself is going to be doing the publishing for PC instead of NIS America,
4894460	4899380	who's doing it for the Sony platforms.
4899380	4905660	The other games were ported by Abstraction Games who did some pretty good stuff.
4905660	4911240	So I'm really excited because I kind of didn't want to play it on something with a controller.
4911240	4918420	I much prefer playing the Danganronpa series on my computer because then it's easier to
4918420	4921540	pause, I can walk away from it, I don't hurt my hands so much.
4921540	4924580	So for me, this is really good news.
4924580	4930260	And then it's also easier of course to screenshot, so Danganronpa.
4930260	4933660	One of those series I'll get into on a rainy day at some point.
4933660	4934660	You should.
4934660	4937500	So much stuff to play.
4937500	4939100	There's better stuff to play.
4939100	4943180	Alright, moving on, just a couple more stories for you guys.
4943180	4947100	Then the classic game of the week, ooh and the classic game this week is a pretty good
4947100	4948100	one.
4948100	4952220	I mean I could say that every week but let's be real, she picks some real stinkers sometimes.
4952220	4953900	And purpose.
4953900	4955820	This one is a stinker but it's a good one.
4955820	4956820	Anyway, I'll leave it at that.
4956820	4957820	Loki.
4957820	4964100	Alright, so GDC, they announced the new Xbox Live Creators Program.
4964100	4969380	So what's kind of different than the current ID at Xbox program that they have right now
4969380	4972660	is they're lowering the barrier of entries.
4972660	4976640	So right now, and I think this is kind of what they hinted at before were any Xbox to
4976640	4978540	be used as a dev kit.
4978540	4985780	Anyone with an Xbox One in conjunction with different game engines like Construct 2, MonoGame
4985780	4994060	and Unity, you can develop a game for it and the Windows 10 store with Xbox Live's integration
4994060	4999780	and they also, with that, they're going to have their own sections in both of those stores.
4999780	5004900	Microsoft does not have to provide concept approval for the game in order to appear on
5004900	5005900	the store.
5005900	5006900	Oh.
5006900	5007900	Or, yeah.
5008260	5013020	So, yeah, real easy barrier to entry there.
5013020	5015500	So are we kind of getting back to the indie game thing then?
5015500	5018100	That's what this is starting to sound like, yeah.
5018100	5023340	But how do they know, because they used to have the peer review process, right, to kind
5023340	5024340	of filter out some of the crap?
5024340	5026820	I don't know if they're going to continue to have that.
5026820	5032520	I would imagine that maybe they have some sort of review program in there.
5032520	5037500	But yeah, you can already sign up for it in developer or Microsoft.com.
5037500	5040380	It was the Xbox Live Creators Program.
5040380	5043980	Which is why we are out there, because I need to know if this means we're getting Bungee
5043980	5046740	Ferret tossing on Xbox One.
5046740	5050060	That's what the minute I heard about this and the fact that, oh, it's Xbox One's answer
5050060	5053280	to the indie games thing, that was the first question.
5053280	5057100	Some of the other differences that are on this between the two different programs, because
5057100	5060460	I'm not sure if they're going to keep both programs on there as well.
5060460	5063020	Well, indie games is gone or they were there.
5063020	5064020	All right.
5064020	5066220	I know the indie games is gone, but they had ID at Xbox.
5066220	5067860	So there's two different things right now.
5067860	5071940	So yeah, I guess you can apply for either one.
5071940	5077740	So the Creators Program, for example, the presence on the storefront is a little bit
5077740	5079700	more basic.
5079700	5084300	The multiplayer is not supported.
5084300	5087740	And achievements are not supported.
5087740	5091200	Which is, that was all in line with indie games, if I remember right.
5091200	5094460	So you could do like leaderboards on indie games, maybe, but that was about it.
5094460	5095460	Yeah, multiplayer, though.
5095460	5096460	Did they?
5096460	5101500	But wait, we heard Xbox Live integration, so that doesn't really seem to jive with that
5101500	5102500	article.
5102500	5106740	I think it's something like you can do leaderboards, but you can't do like full on frickin' like
5106740	5107740	multiplayer at the same time.
5107740	5109260	They have multiplayer, though, in indie games.
5109260	5112100	Because I remember they have those really shitty Minecraft clones that you could do
5112100	5113100	multiplayer in.
5113100	5114100	I don't know.
5114100	5116100	I mean, it's a neat idea.
5116100	5120740	I'd be willing to check it out whenever I get an Xbox One.
5120740	5124220	Okay, Bobby's helping out with some of the answers to the question I have about YYR.
5124220	5128020	Bobby Blackwell says, he'd have to convert Bungee Ferret tossing to Unity and make it
5128020	5129700	a universal Windows app.
5129700	5130980	I forgot about that, of course.
5130980	5134940	XNA was a whole other language that you could make, so that would be a challenge in itself.
5134940	5136500	I get that.
5136500	5141420	Bobby continues, you're creating universal Windows program apps with the Xbox One Creators
5141420	5145580	Club, not actual Xbox One games, and XNA isn't supported.
5145580	5150340	You could do leaderboards only, but not achievements, not sure about online play.
5150340	5152020	So okay, that makes a little more sense.
5152020	5156060	So this is where basically, but you could put, so hypothetically, you could put Time
5156060	5160500	to Car on Xbox One, if you ever finished the fucking thing, because you did it in Unity.
5160500	5161500	I could.
5161500	5163220	I wouldn't want to.
5163220	5164220	But you could.
5164220	5165220	I could.
5165220	5166220	You could.
5166220	5167220	Or I could make just something else for it.
5167220	5169220	I mean, yeah.
5169220	5172540	I'm going to be very curious, especially now that we're going to be meeting with a ton
5172540	5175840	of indie gamers in a month's time, I'm going to be very, I want to poll some of these folks
5175840	5181220	to talk about, like, what is this going to mean for them and what they're doing?
5181220	5182940	I'm very curious to hear that.
5182940	5183940	So, yeah.
5183940	5184940	All right.
5184940	5189340	Well, we'll see what continues to develop with this and what indie folks we know that
5189340	5191940	might take advantage of it.
5191940	5196500	One other game that a lot of folks are still playing and getting ready for its sequel,
5196500	5198020	which, you know, we know one's happening.
5198020	5201440	We just don't know when exactly, but that's Destiny.
5201440	5206380	So Destiny is a game that many people are still playing online and having a good time
5206380	5211020	with, and some folks were ready for Destiny 2 to come out so they could take all that
5211020	5215460	character and all the progress they've built and move it into Destiny 2, except Bungie
5215460	5219400	said this week, it's not going to work that way, actually.
5219400	5226140	The characters that you made in Destiny 1 will be reset going into the new game.
5226140	5231020	So everything you've earned in Destiny, like your money, your points, and all that stuff,
5231020	5232700	not going to happen.
5232700	5238220	However, if you have, I guess, like, cool outfits and things like that, you can bring
5238220	5239720	those over to Destiny 2.
5239720	5244600	Some of that stuff will come over as far as the more look type of things.
5244600	5250780	But your powers, your possessions, Eververse-related items and currency will be stuck in the first
5250780	5251780	game.
5251780	5252780	That's it.
5252780	5256640	Personalizations, if you got past level 20 and did the Black Garden story mission, that
5256640	5258300	will carry over.
5258300	5263000	Some people kind of see that as a little harsh reboot, but at the same time, I kind of look
5263000	5264800	at this and go, it is a separate game, though.
5264800	5268500	If Destiny 2 is supposed to be a separate game, they want everybody to start over.
5268500	5271540	That's part of the reason I haven't really got back into Destiny myself is because I
5271540	5275540	played it in the very beginning and, you know, it was fun, but then I didn't really have
5275540	5278300	time for all these expansions and things like that.
5278300	5281000	And now it's like, well, I don't really want to get back into it because everybody else
5281000	5282740	is like so far along.
5282740	5286940	So Destiny 2 is going to kind of hit the reset button on that a little bit, I think.
5286940	5289260	I guess it's like EverQuest 1 and EverQuest 2, right?
5289260	5292720	Your characters didn't really carry over there either, but that ended up being a bad thing
5292720	5298000	for EverQuest 2 because a lot of folks wanted to stay behind and play EverQuest 1.
5298000	5300880	You could look at Final Fantasy 11 and 14 kind of the same way.
5300880	5304120	Not everybody, you know, the two games don't really have anything in common.
5304120	5308360	There's some people, not a ton, but some people who stayed behind and would rather play the
5308360	5310420	older game.
5310420	5311420	But I don't know.
5311420	5314360	Destiny is also much different than your other traditional MMOs.
5314360	5318520	I don't know if Destiny is going to have that same problem that those other games I mentioned
5318520	5321920	had because it's still going to be a very similar type of game.
5321920	5327780	So anyway, Kaijuto does bring up an interesting counterpoint, though, going, didn't they
5327780	5330940	sell Destiny as this ongoing story that you live in?
5330940	5333540	Oh yeah, it was that whole 10-year plan for Destiny.
5333540	5334540	Remember that?
5334540	5339020	Well, that doesn't sound like it worked out so well.
5339020	5341100	Kind of like the PlayStation 4's 10-year life cycle.
5341100	5343860	Well, I mean, it sort of worked out.
5343860	5349620	I mean, if we want to not consider this new console a new console.
5349620	5353700	Here's the thing, too, with Destiny is that they would probably tell you that Destiny
5353700	5356260	2 is part of that life cycle.
5356260	5359240	And there are some things you're carrying over.
5359240	5361420	You're carrying the essence of your...
5361420	5362420	Oh, fuck them.
5362420	5364340	The essence, Loki.
5364340	5370420	The essence, the O'Day character is coming over from the original Destiny.
5370420	5372420	That's what you get.
5372420	5374940	All right.
5374940	5375940	You know what?
5375940	5381140	We need to take a trip down memory lane, back to simpler times.
5381140	5386220	When there was no expectation of this online system and things that carried over, you play
5386220	5389220	the game, you beat it, and then you threw it in the trash.
5389220	5390220	Just kidding.
5390220	5391220	You didn't do that.
5391220	5394540	You put it in the gaming vault where DarkSakura walks into every week to find a game that
5394540	5401500	she thinks, hey, look, brats, put down your Switch.
5401500	5402500	Why don't you switch?
5402500	5403500	I'll switch you.
5403500	5404500	I'll switch you.
5404500	5406420	Go pick your own Switch.
5406420	5410140	And here it is, the classic game of the week, DarkSakura.
5410140	5412740	What is the classic game that the kids should be playing this week?
5412740	5413740	Night Trap.
5413740	5414740	Oh, God.
5414780	5416700	Maybe kids actually shouldn't be playing this game.
5416700	5417900	No, they shouldn't be playing it.
5417900	5423100	Actually, it's really not that great of a game, but it's iconic, I will say.
5423100	5425980	Yes, it is a legendary video game, if nothing else.
5425980	5428780	Starring the late Dana Plato.
5428780	5429780	R.I.P.
5429780	5436100	Who had a shithole of life after different strokes, but still.
5436100	5441380	It is an interactive movie game that was done by Digital Pictures for the Sega CD, and it
5441380	5445380	came out in North America on October 15th, 1992.
5445380	5451700	It had ports for the Sega 32X, the 3DO, MS-DOS, and Mac OS.
5451700	5459060	It was basically 90 minutes of full motion video that basically the advent of the CD
5459060	5462220	ROM pretty much is what made a game like this possible.
5462220	5469340	So basically, the plot of the game is that these young women of various states of dress
5469380	5474460	are the targets of these things called augurs, who are vampiric kind of beings who want to
5474460	5476740	steal their blood.
5476740	5480860	And so you have to switch between these different hidden cameras and activate traps to catch
5480860	5484300	them to save the women.
5484300	5489900	Now the thing that makes this game notable, even though it's not that great of a game,
5489900	5495880	is that it was really a source of controversy, because in 1993, people had an even bigger
5495880	5500800	stick up their ass, and it was really mature, really mature.
5500800	5505280	There was a bathroom scene where the girl's wearing a towel, and she screams for like
5505280	5509560	seven minutes with a pipe in her throat, well, the little augur thing.
5509560	5512600	They like this hook that goes around your throat, and it looks like it's got a pump
5512600	5513600	attached to it.
5513600	5514600	Okay, gross, gross, gross.
5514600	5516360	Yeah, anyway.
5516360	5523000	In the US, it was actually one of the games that contributed to the creation of the ESRB,
5523000	5525680	the Entertainment Software Rating Board.
5525680	5530560	In the UK, it got a 15 rating.
5530560	5533700	So basically back to Night Trap, the game itself.
5533700	5544200	So you have an undercover agent whose name is Kelly, played by Dana Plato, who has infiltrated
5544200	5546080	one of these parties.
5546080	5552600	And these women are staying at Mr. and Mrs. Martin's house, and they seem like a normal
5552600	5556600	family, but five other girls who had stayed at this house before disappeared, so why other
5556600	5560360	people are wanting to go the fuck to this house, I have no idea.
5560360	5569300	And so they send in the Sega Control Attack Team, also SCAT, on other systems it was changed
5569300	5577960	to Special Control Attack Team, so yes, the SCAT team sends Kelly in, and you are monitoring
5577960	5579720	the whole situation through hidden cameras.
5579720	5583160	I don't even know how the fuck they got the hidden cameras in the house, but you know,
5583160	5585000	a lot of magic.
5585000	5589080	Finally some actual people too, like the whole first five minutes of this was just watching
5589080	5594600	these guys get, fall through trap doors, and fall through curtains and things like that.
5594600	5597640	But now we actually, I was like, where's the chicks in bikinis?
5597640	5598640	Where's that part?
5598640	5601880	And now we're finally at least seeing people, even though these are not.
5601880	5605360	I was promised girls in panties, pillow fighting.
5605360	5610920	Where is that?
5610920	5618840	The game is called the trap em up genre, so you have the events that are going on in different
5618840	5624220	areas of the house, and you can only view one at a time, and so you can actually see
5624220	5629160	the augers creep into the house, and you have to spot them and use traps to capture them,
5629160	5638280	they have to get to certain places and you trigger the trap kinda, I mean, kinda like
5638280	5643980	Dragon's Lair, I guess, a little bit, but more like, more timed in certain places, so.
5643980	5648680	We need a crossover between this and Five Nights at Freddy's.
5648680	5649680	They've gone into the wrong house.
5649680	5651680	Five Nights at Scaddy's.
5651680	5657280	Anyway, you, the way that you do, actually, I don't think it would be too off from Five
5657280	5659840	Nights at Freddy's, just a little bit less interactive.
5659840	5663000	You know, it's more scripted, I think, than this, where Five Nights at Freddy's tends
5663000	5665120	to be a bit more random.
5665120	5673720	But anyway, you have access codes that pop up on the screens, and the codes change the
5673720	5678120	different parts of the course of the game, so you have to keep the accurate code by listening
5678120	5685080	to the different conversations, and so you actually have to play the game multiple times
5685080	5687800	to get what these codes are.
5687800	5694040	The game is real-time, it cannot be rewound, and if you miss too many of the augurs, the
5694040	5698440	game will end, or if certain characters are taken away, or if the host of the slumber
5698440	5702320	party disconnects your access to the traps.
5702320	5706600	You know, there's even, like, one part where, like, your boss in the control center cans
5706600	5713200	you, for sucking, he yells at you for letting all those poor, poor half-naked women die.
5713200	5714740	Aw.
5714740	5721980	So it was actually filmed in Culver City, three weeks in 1987, and it was originally
5721980	5729980	developed for Hasbro's control vision video game system that was codenamed Nemo, and it
5729980	5733340	used VHS tapes instead of ROM cartridges.
5733340	5738820	But Hasbro discontinued the production, and so the footage went into an archive until
5738820	5743060	the founders of Digital Pictures purchased it in 1991.
5743060	5749740	So they imported everything over for a CD-ROM format, put it out on the Sega CD, and then
5749740	5754820	later there was the 32X, 3DO, and PC versions that had higher quality.
5754820	5758900	There also was a Mac OS version.
5758900	5764540	You had, for actors in there, you also had, apart from Dana Plato, you had Arthur Burghardt,
5764540	5768060	Blake Gibbons, and Andrus Jones, which I don't know what else the fuck they were in.
5768060	5769700	I've never heard any of those people.
5769700	5772220	I was just looking at the names of the actors, I was like, who are they?
5772220	5775100	The only one I recognize is Dana Plato.
5775100	5780220	So with the release, basically the mentions of Sega products were removed from the 3DO
5780220	5788500	and PC and Mac versions, so they actually replaced some of the videos with the original
5788500	5794540	footage that was made for the first release for the Hasbro control vision.
5794540	5802120	Some of the other versions were also giving higher quality video, because the Sega CD
5802120	5807000	didn't really have the best resolution for video.
5807000	5813480	The 3DO version had an on-screen map with the color codes for the different rooms.
5813480	5821080	The PC and Mac one had a save function within the game, and a pause menu, so you could look
5821080	5823560	at the house on the pause menu.
5823560	5831560	It also had the documentary called Dangerous Games that was about this game and the controversy
5831560	5832560	around it.
5832560	5843880	There was also never released footage for the VHS-1 that is viewable on the Sega CD
5843880	5848480	version by entering a button code, and the credits will read, In Memory of Steven D.
5848480	5851600	Hasenfeld.
5851600	5857640	The footage is basically Hasbro executives looking at the original version's scene of
5857640	5862640	the crime back in 1987.
5862640	5869040	In 2014, the creator of Night Trap said he wanted to re-release it with better resolution
5869040	5870040	and gameplay.
5870040	5876440	There was a Kickstarter out for it, but the developers said that if it was successful,
5876440	5882580	that they would have done other of the Digital Pictures title, or making a sequel to the
5882580	5883880	game.
5883880	5888960	There is a mobile prototype that showed up on YouTube, but nothing else about it.
5888960	5893280	The game actually sold really well, but because of the controversy over it, it only had an
5893280	5895600	initial print run.
5895600	5897800	It was a best seller in the UK.
5897800	5906400	However, ratings themselves were pretty, pretty, I'd say on the low end.
5906400	5911240	But it was novel that they were using live actors and that you had to play through the
5911240	5917080	game multiple times to see everything, so it had great replayability.
5917080	5926840	Electronic Games give them an 89% overall, but EGM, Electronic Games Monthly, gave it
5926840	5931760	a really mediocre review.
5931760	5938020	It's kind of not so great, really.
5938020	5942380	People who have reviewed it since then just really gave it a kind of snore rating.
5942380	5949820	And Night Trap was voted the 12th worst video game of all time in an EGM article.
5949820	5956700	And yeah, basically, it's just, you know, it wasn't all that great.
5956700	5961740	But like I said, still novel for a time, and the big thing about it is the controversy.
5961740	5972300	So in 1993, right before Christmas, the game was removed from shelves at Toys R Us and
5972300	5978700	KB after they received complaints that were part of, as they figured out after the fact,
5978700	5984180	it was a type of telephone campaign, but they still stalked Mortal Kombat and other violent
5984180	5985180	games.
5985180	5993360	That actually led to a 1993 joint State Judiciary and Government Affairs Committee having a
5993360	5995800	hearing on the video games.
5995800	6000700	And so basically, it was announced later that there would be a censored version.
6000700	6007460	But no, the ones that were co-chairing this was Joseph Lieberman and Herbert Kohl, who
6007460	6011860	thought it was shameful, ultra-violent, sick and disgusting, and encouraged an effort to
6011860	6012860	trap and kill women.
6012860	6016380	Like, people don't know it's a fucking video game.
6016380	6018340	But it made, like, all the news everywhere.
6018340	6023900	I even remember this, you know, as a teen, you know, that it was in USA Today, it was
6023900	6029860	in New York Times, Washington Post, the local papers, it was all over the place.
6029860	6036900	And it was also pretty much, I mean, the characters in the games, and this is actually outlined
6036900	6045880	in that Dangerous Games documentary that's also in the PC version, is that the producers
6045880	6051540	and the cast members said that they thought that it was for the sake of, to prevent the
6051540	6056420	trapping and killing of women, and that the blood draining device was intended to look
6056420	6059580	unrealistic, which honestly, it looks fucking unrealistic.
6059580	6064180	Like I was like, how the fuck is that a thing, really?
6064180	6070580	But then, you know, there's no nudity in the game, or no extreme violence.
6070580	6074820	But people were saying, oh no, it's really, it's violent, I mean, they might be scantily
6074820	6076900	clad, but they weren't fucking naked.
6076900	6078980	You know, it's just boobs.
6078980	6079980	What the hell.
6079980	6080980	Everyone's got boobs.
6080980	6081980	There's worse in movies.
6081980	6082980	Men have boobs.
6082980	6083980	Okay?
6083980	6084980	Everyone's got boobs.
6084980	6091380	Anyway, there were a lot of people who just thought that it was a really sexist game.
6091380	6098820	I mean, yeah, I think that it is a bit, yeah, it's sexist, I mean, it's meant to play on
6098820	6104220	the whole horror movie genre with the, you know, girls in pillow fights and bikinis and
6104220	6105220	shit like that.
6105220	6112220	But at the same time, it wasn't overt, you know, it's not like it was a snuff game, you
6112220	6113220	know.
6113220	6119220	At any rate, the game did get ported even after the controversy.
6119220	6129540	The ports were done in 1994, and later on the MS-DOS and Mac versions were out in 1995.
6129540	6134300	They had a different cover on each of them, but all of them had pictures of Dana Plato
6134300	6139300	on it, which the Sega CD one was purely illustrated.
6139300	6142060	So and that's it, Night Trap.
6142060	6148020	I actually really want to see the documentary now though, because I knew about it, but I
6148020	6149020	hadn't seen it.
6149820	6152620	All right, there it is, your classic game of the week.
6152620	6154500	But is it a classic though?
6154500	6155500	Night Trap.
6155500	6158900	Well, no, it absolutely changed gaming.
6158900	6164500	I mean, even though it's a ridiculous freaking game, it did change gaming for better or for worse.
6164500	6169860	And that's, you know, one of the things about the classic game segment is not just an outline,
6169860	6173380	oh, this game was great, it's an instant classic and blah, blah, blah.
6173380	6175580	It's a classic like the Mustang.
6175580	6181460	It's also how did it contribute to gaming and I will interspace shitty games that contributed
6181460	6182460	to gaming.
6182460	6183460	Of course.
6183460	6184460	So there you go.
6184460	6185460	Of which there's been plenty.
6185460	6188900	And this is actually even considered the same genre as Lode Runner.
6188900	6189900	Why?
6189900	6191260	Because it's a trap game.
6191260	6192860	Oh, God.
6192860	6195420	That's a stretch in my opinion.
6195420	6197340	I guess puzzle games, maybe.
6197340	6198340	I don't know.
6198340	6199340	Anyway.
6199340	6200340	All right.
6200340	6203100	There it is, your classic game of the week, Night Trap starring Dana Plato.
6203100	6204100	Rest in peace.
6204140	6205140	We're going to take a break.
6205140	6206660	When we come back from the break, we're going to continue it.
6206660	6209420	We're going to finally seal this time capsule away.
6209420	6212220	And then we're going to get into some rapid fire news.
6212220	6216700	Your calls pretty soon here at Orange Lounge Radio on Skype when we come back after this
6216700	6219140	break with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
6225140	6228380	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.
6228380	6233780	Live tonight, March the 5th of 2017 with episode number 678 of our show already in
6233780	6234780	progress.
6234780	6238940	Now, I want to give a quick shout out to our pals over at Anime Jam Session, also here
6238940	6240220	on the Voice of Geeks Network.
6240220	6244060	Now, I falsely said a couple of weeks ago that they were going to be having their 300th
6244060	6246580	episode because I figured, well, what comes after 299?
6246580	6247580	300.
6247580	6251260	Well, I got fooled because they actually had a 299.5.
6251260	6254620	And then as Rama said when he called in the show last week, they took a week off.
6254620	6259060	But episode 300 is finally happening with Anime Jam Session this Tuesday.
6259060	6261540	So y'all should check it out live.
6261540	6262540	Be here.
6262540	6263540	All right.
6263540	6264540	Are you going to check it out, Dark Sakura?
6264540	6266540	You need to be there for Ran-chan.
6266540	6267540	Maybe.
6267540	6268540	Maybe.
6268540	6271820	Well, if you can't be here live, there's always the podcast feed.
6271820	6272820	Yes.
6272820	6273820	You can always check that out.
6273820	6276660	All the shows that make up the Voice of Geeks Network, you can check out their podcast feeds
6276660	6278940	over at vognetwork.com and all the way to the shows.
6278940	6281220	Sometimes work gets in the way, that nasty necessity.
6281220	6282220	Oh, yeah.
6282220	6283220	That whole thing.
6283820	6285420	Man, if only we could just ban work.
6285420	6286420	All right.
6286420	6289020	Before we get into rapid fire news, we need to finish the time capsule.
6289020	6292620	So somebody had that idea of putting in, what is it?
6292620	6293620	What are we putting in here?
6293620	6295740	The three games we just can't stop playing right now?
6295740	6296740	Yeah.
6296740	6298020	To see if that changes by the end of the year.
6298020	6299020	Yeah.
6299020	6300020	All right.
6300020	6302020	So even though Loki's like, I don't want to fill it out, then put one-
6302020	6303020	What the fuck were we thinking?
6303020	6306260	Then put one Skyrim, two Skyrim, three Skyrim.
6306260	6308620	You get this tiny piece of paper to write on, Loki.
6308620	6309620	All right.
6309620	6310620	All right.
6310620	6311620	And make sure to sign it because I don't know who's going to do what.
6311620	6312620	All right.
6313020	6316300	So I'm going to put number one, obviously it will be Final Fantasy 14 because I play
6316300	6317300	way too much of that.
6317300	6322540	I was going to see if I ever beat Danganronpa 2, which I'm still halfway through.
6322540	6328580	Number two, I'm going to put Overwatch because I do play a lot of that with Alan.
6328580	6332540	I want to know if Alan's still playing Overwatch 2 at that point.
6332540	6334900	Now the third one's a little harder to pick.
6334900	6336820	What am I obsessed with right now?
6336820	6338980	I'm not sure what I play.
6338980	6342500	I mean, like obviously this particular weekend I've been playing a lot of Breath of the
6343380	6344380	Wild, but does that count?
6344380	6345380	Yeah.
6345380	6350540	Can I put number three, overcome with anticipation for Mass Effect Andromeda?
6350540	6353220	Maybe we could do a second list of what we're looking forward to this year.
6353220	6354220	Okay.
6354220	6356220	That time capsule is only so big and we don't want that segment to be our own.
6356220	6358220	We'll just use little pieces of paper, Loki.
6358220	6359660	Let's see.
6359660	6370780	I'm just going to put, um, I'm just going to put number three, um, overcome with feelings
6370780	6375980	about Andromeda.
6375980	6378980	I'll just put Breath of the Wild, even though I'm not playing that yet.
6378980	6379980	But you're not playing it.
6379980	6380980	You're cheating.
6380980	6382980	But I will be in like a couple of weeks.
6382980	6383980	All right.
6383980	6384980	All right.
6384980	6385980	Overcome with feelings about Andromeda.
6386300	6393260	D.S. was the gay sex good?
6393260	6394260	Question mark.
6394260	6397300	That's an important question I want to answer in December, right?
6397300	6401500	I just put OMG Mass Effect Andromeda in big letters, but since I'm playing through Breath
6401500	6403660	of the Wild is sort of an afterthought.
6403660	6404660	Right.
6404660	6409300	Oh, I should, even though I totally know my own handwriting, I will still sign this with
6409300	6413060	my name there.
6413060	6414300	Fold it up.
6414300	6415300	Put it in the time capsule.
6415620	6416620	Okay.
6416620	6417620	What'd you put on your list?
6417620	6418620	Dark Sakura.
6418620	6419620	Um, I put World of Warcraft.
6419620	6420620	Okay.
6420620	6421620	Yeah.
6421620	6422620	You have been playing.
6422620	6426020	I should specify that it's Legion, although they haven't announced the next, uh, thing.
6426020	6429580	They probably will at the next BlizzCon just in time for the end of the year.
6429580	6432940	Danganronpa 2, cause I haven't beaten it yet and I'm still trying to.
6432940	6434940	And then Breath of the Wild cause Dan and I are doing it together.
6434940	6437060	And then in big letters, I did OMG Mass Effect Andromeda.
6437060	6438060	Okay.
6438060	6439940	So you actually, you actually did put three games.
6439940	6441380	Now what'd you put, Loki?
6441380	6445060	Skyrim Remastered, Until Dawn, Rush of Blood, and Skyrim Remastered.
6445060	6446060	Okay.
6446060	6447060	Good enough.
6447060	6448060	All right.
6448060	6449060	I accept that answer.
6449060	6450060	I didn't put my name on there, but I mean.
6450060	6451060	Fine.
6451060	6452060	We'll deal with it.
6452060	6453060	Is it Skyrim?
6453060	6454060	We know it's you.
6454060	6455060	If it's Skyrim, we know it's you.
6455060	6456060	Or Alan snuck one in there.
6456060	6457060	All right.
6457060	6458060	So here we go.
6458060	6459060	Let's make the seal it away.
6459060	6460060	Tape it.
6460060	6461060	Noises.
6461060	6462060	You're sealing it away.
6462060	6463060	I don't want to go get tape.
6463060	6464060	Tape it.
6464060	6465060	Tape it.
6465060	6467660	And you know what's funny is as I'm talking to this, I just realized we have a whole like
6467660	6470300	Tootsie Roll thing that we're holding the pens in, but this works great.
6470300	6471300	But that one doesn't have a lid.
6471300	6472300	It doesn't have a lid.
6472300	6473780	It doesn't have any Tootsie Rolls in it.
6473780	6474780	Where are we?
6474780	6475780	Oh yeah.
6475780	6476780	Where are we going to put candy?
6476780	6478260	We're going to put a Tootsie Roll in there.
6478260	6481420	And some of my hair to see what color it is.
6481420	6482780	I sealed it away.
6482780	6484620	So there's a hole on the top.
6484620	6485620	Done.
6485620	6486620	All right.
6486620	6487620	There it is.
6487620	6488620	All right.
6488620	6489620	So where am I going to put this now?
6489620	6490620	I guess I'll just put it here.
6490620	6491620	Yep.
6491620	6492620	There.
6492620	6493620	It'll sit.
6493620	6494620	To be opened December 2017.
6494620	6495620	We should cover it with like stickers.
6495620	6496620	Like randomly.
6496620	6497620	All right.
6497620	6498620	There it is.
6498620	6499620	Come on.
6499620	6500620	No Gus suggests lick it shut.
6500620	6501620	No.
6501940	6504140	I haven't decided if I'm licking Rob's cartridges yet.
6504140	6507980	Apparently I saw a picture of someone's dog that did shoot up one of those cartridges.
6507980	6509980	So that stuff doesn't really seem to stop dogs.
6509980	6511900	Yeah, but dogs also have weird senses of taste.
6511900	6512900	It doesn't affect pets.
6512900	6513900	Dogs eat their own shit.
6513900	6514900	Okay.
6514900	6517200	Well, which is why he was chewing on one, two switch.
6517200	6519620	So it is kind of the equivalent of eating shit.
6519620	6520620	So that makes sense.
6520620	6524000	Uh, it's two one hundred Matt and Chad says, put it up on a shelf that is away from San
6524000	6525000	Rio.
6525000	6526000	A, San Rio 17.
6526000	6527880	She doesn't do that shit anymore.
6527880	6530120	But B, we did, I did put it up on a shelf.
6530560	6534380	In our studio here, we have an elevated television that we use for the PlayStation three because
6534380	6538080	we actually use tune in to listen to Bobby Black Wolf here in studio before the show
6538080	6539080	goes live.
6539080	6543080	It almost makes me think if you painted that green, it would sort of look like a cactuar.
6543080	6544080	It does.
6544080	6545080	Like with the little arms sticking out.
6545080	6546920	It would look like a cactuar if you painted it green.
6546920	6552800	I'm going to put it up on, um, on my, uh, Facebook fan page.
6552800	6553800	Jamie Summers on Facebook.
6553800	6554920	You have a Facebook fan page?
6554920	6555920	I do.
6555920	6556920	All right.
6556920	6557920	Why wouldn't I?
6557920	6558920	You have fans?
6558920	6559920	Yeah.
6560720	6561720	Y'all need fan pages.
6561720	6563720	You don't have fans without a fan page.
6563720	6564720	I'm sorry.
6564720	6565720	My ego's not that big.
6565720	6566720	I have a Twitch.
6566720	6567720	You can follow me.
6567720	6568720	You can stroke my ego on Twitch.
6568720	6571720	I did it because I was doing other shit too.
6571720	6572720	That's fair.
6572720	6573720	I'm just, I'm just giving you crap.
6573720	6575520	Well, you always give me crap.
6575520	6576520	Stop crapping.
6576520	6577520	All right.
6577520	6578520	There we go.
6578520	6579520	You kind of need to crap.
6579520	6580520	Nevermind.
6580520	6584320	Ah, let's get into some rapid fire news and hopefully some non crappy things that happened
6584320	6585520	in gaming this week.
6585520	6586520	Loki.
6586520	6587520	Yes.
6588120	6592320	So one of the things during GDC that was talked about was Unreal Engine.
6592320	6597320	And of course with that, um, they made some more updates about Fortnite.
6597320	6601120	Hey, remember that game that was supposed to be coming out on Unreal Engine 4?
6601120	6602120	No.
6602120	6606920	It was supposed to be like a zombie survival game that was, you know, building your own
6606920	6608820	base and stuff like that.
6608820	6610120	So it's still coming.
6610120	6616360	Um, it's supposed to be coming out this year on PC according to Tim Sweeney.
6616360	6617360	All right then.
6617400	6619200	So yeah, we'll look forward to it then.
6619200	6624200	Um, something else that's going to be in development as well is Sleeping Dogs, the movie.
6624200	6629600	So that's that Hong Kong action, open world action game that they had.
6629600	6636360	Um, now it's supposed to, I guess, star, who do they have starring in there?
6636360	6642200	Uh, it's being produced by Neil H. Morris, who did the Fast and the Furious, I am Legend
6642200	6644320	21 Jump Street.
6644360	6648640	And it's going to star Donnie Yen, who is, you know, definitely well known in the Hong
6648640	6651760	Kong, um, you know, movie scene.
6651760	6660160	It Man, Rogue One, um, and of course, uh, triple X Return of Xander Cage.
6660160	6661160	I'm down.
6661160	6662160	That'd be pretty awesome.
6662160	6665280	That movie or the game was pretty cinematic as it was.
6665280	6671960	So I don't need really an excuse to go see Hong Kong action movies.
6671960	6675840	Not everyone is excited about it because, you know, in our chat over at live.vog network.com
6675840	6682400	says Sleeping Dogs, the movie, no, I feel like I should shake the Vader thing.
6682400	6683400	No.
6683400	6684400	Shake.
6684400	6685400	Shake.
6685400	6686400	Shake.
6686400	6687400	All right.
6687400	6688400	Uh, let's see.
6688400	6689400	Um, yeah.
6689400	6693960	Uh, I don't know if, uh, it needs a movie, but okay.
6693960	6696640	I mean, we could really use a good video game movie.
6696640	6698240	That would be nice.
6698240	6701000	At least we have some good sportsmanship in the video game world.
6701040	6705840	Uh, the switch of course being released on Friday, believe it or not lent to some official
6705840	6711280	comments from the PlayStation and the Xbox Twitter accounts that were very nice.
6711280	6714760	Uh, the PlayStation account tweeting today's a big day for Nintendo.
6714760	6715760	Congrats on launch.
6715760	6721800	We can't wait to play with a little blue heart blue cause PlayStation, uh, whereas, uh, Microsoft
6721800	6725900	wrote a little tweet on their Xbox account that said at Nintendo, it's not every day
6725900	6729360	you get to throw the switch on a new console.
6729400	6730400	So, uh, congrats.
6730400	6732080	Hashtag Nintendo switch at Nintendo.
6732080	6734960	They did a little animation that did like achievement unlocked.
6734960	6738780	So even though they were gradually Nintendo, they had a very Microsoft thing and she'd
6738780	6739920	been unlocked.
6739920	6748240	We have achievements and you don't, that should, now that would have been the classless thing
6748240	6749240	to do.
6749240	6753200	Uh, Microsoft does what intend don't type of thing to respond, but isn't it nice though
6753200	6755600	to see these, this has come a long way.
6755600	6757260	What did Denny's and Arby's say?
6757260	6760160	That's really what we want to know.
6760160	6761160	That's a really good point.
6761160	6762880	I think Denny's tweeted one of those pictures.
6762880	6765480	It's like, look left, look right.
6765480	6766720	You're having an existential crisis.
6766720	6767720	There's, I don't know.
6767720	6768720	It was really funny.
6768720	6771640	I think I retweeted it, but yes, we need to know what did the Arby's account have to say?
6771640	6772640	That's the most important.
6772640	6774240	Or was it the Sonic account?
6774240	6775240	That's very...
6775240	6776240	Sonic the Hedgehog.
6776240	6778400	Oh, I'm pretty sure they had tweeted something too.
6778400	6779400	It's important.
6779400	6783400	Uh, anyway, so, uh, also, which I thought was neat, uh, somebody else had tweeted, uh,
6783400	6788240	like a reply that said, love when companies congratulate each other, makes it seem like
6788240	6792640	we are all united and Xbox replied, it's all for the love of the games with the thumbs
6792640	6793640	up emoji.
6793640	6795800	So that was nice.
6795800	6800200	But also I think the fact that it's Nintendo and you know, obviously Nintendo marches to
6800200	6801800	the beat of their own drum.
6801800	6806560	And so I think the competition is especially a little lesson there and come on guys.
6806560	6813500	I'm sure the people that work at Sony and Microsoft probably play Nintendo.
6813500	6814500	You know what?
6814500	6818520	I bet the guys at Sony play Xbox and the guys at Microsoft play PlayStation.
6818520	6822880	These two companies, they're not worried about Nintendo because they know the last couple
6822880	6825720	of generations, it hasn't really eaten into their profits too much.
6825720	6833000	They're probably just like, good job, good job, you know, putting out a console, you
6833000	6834000	know.
6834000	6838080	But look, the reality is too, that the games industry is like a small place too.
6838080	6842160	So like, it's like, okay, look, Sony is not going to write a tweet that says, get fucked
6842160	6843160	Nintendo.
6843160	6849640	They're not going to write that tweet because then when like, you know, the, the social
6849640	6853920	media person at one of these companies wants to go get a job somewhere else, they're going
6853920	6858020	to be like, what was up with that tweet you sent to Nintendo that told me to become president
6858020	6861440	someday, right?
6861440	6865360	That's that's the only time you're going to be able to get away with, you know, as much
6865360	6870400	as Trump tweets, he is really missing some, get fucked in there.
6870400	6876780	I mean, cause that would just be like, hilarious, hilarious in the fact that like, Oh, Hey,
6876780	6882580	there's blue flames coming off of the fire now, uh, dungeon buster and chat over at life.com
6882580	6886760	says, if I recall correctly, major Nelson tweeted a picture of breath of the wild saying
6886760	6890880	it was for research in quotes, see, it's cute.
6890880	6897360	Come on, come on, look, there's a lot of gamers out there like me who are sick and own everything
6897360	6898360	anyway.
6898360	6899920	So you know what?
6899920	6900920	It's a win.
6900920	6905600	All right, let's move on to a Marvel and, uh, their, their gaming universe, which of
6905600	6909840	course, Marvel versus Capcom infinite is going to be a big release in that universe.
6909840	6914240	There's also though, don't forget the whole square Enix, uh, the, uh, crystal dynamics
6914240	6919400	square, um, uh, Marvel project that's going on too, which I'm down for because it's Marvel
6919400	6920400	cinematic universe.
6920400	6924920	And I like the Marvel said, well, actually, apparently Marvel versus Capcom infinite.
6924920	6929480	Um, they have the freedom to tell their story and they want to make an original story.
6929480	6933440	It is not going to be a part of the cinematic universe.
6933440	6938520	Uh, so, uh, Marvel games goal is to not force a games development timeline to match up with
6938520	6942360	any upcoming movie, TV show or comic book.
6942360	6947020	So these games are not directly tied to the universes in any way.
6947020	6949420	They get to do their own thing.
6949420	6950420	That makes sense.
6950420	6953420	And with that said, I love the Deadpool two teaser.
6953420	6954420	That was, I haven't seen it.
6954420	6957940	I haven't even seen the Deadpool movie, but to be fair, I haven't seen like any movies.
6957940	6958940	I know.
6958940	6960660	Watch the Deadpool movie.
6960660	6961660	Seriously.
6961660	6962660	Go on.
6962660	6963660	Last movie I saw in theaters was Warcraft.
6963660	6965060	That was almost a year ago.
6965060	6966420	Oh God, no.
6966420	6968100	So I was bored enough on Saturday.
6968100	6971580	I mean, obviously I was playing a lot of Zelda, but you have to come up for air once in a
6971580	6972580	while.
6972580	6973580	Right?
6973580	6974580	So I actually started looking, I was looking at this brand new theater.
6974580	6978140	They just opened up with the whole now recliner seats is the big deal, right?
6978140	6981700	And they sell booze at theaters and this is an assigned seating thing, right?
6981700	6985540	So I went onto the website and I was like, well, I want to see this get out because everybody's
6985540	6988340	telling me it's fucking great and it looks good, so I'll go see it.
6988340	6992180	So I was just, just for fun, I was going to pitch to Alan, like, let's go see, get out,
6992180	6993460	I'll go get us tickets.
6993460	6999220	But then as I'm looking online, like completely sold out for seven o'clock completely sold
6999220	7001900	out except for like two seats in the front row for 10 o'clock.
7001900	7005980	And it's like, now that you can buy your seats online, all this stuff like these things,
7005980	7009420	these movies are sold out forever in advance.
7009420	7012580	Like you can't just walk up to the theater anymore and go, yeah, I just want to see whatever
7012580	7013580	movies coming up next.
7013580	7014580	You can't really do that now.
7014580	7018700	And I think the fact that all these theaters have giant recliners means there's less seats
7018700	7019700	in the theater.
7019700	7022780	Um, yeah, they're pretty large.
7022780	7026940	So anyway, so no, I did not see, I haven't seen Logan.
7026940	7031220	I haven't seen Deadpool, but, but don't take it personally, movie fans.
7031220	7036380	I just haven't seen any movies because Alan and I also work the different schedules.
7036380	7038820	So it's hard for us to go see movies together.
7038820	7042300	You know, it's like when we have the time together, we have to do the really exciting
7042300	7049140	things that married folks do and go grocery shopping and go pay bills.
7049140	7050820	We don't have time for movies.
7050820	7051820	Anyway.
7051820	7055060	All right, uh, let's move on.
7055060	7056060	More rapid fire news.
7056060	7057060	Dark Sakura.
7057900	7063220	Ah, if I don't unplug my phone, my, uh, mic here.
7063220	7064220	Geez.
7064220	7067780	So how about some PlayStation Plus?
7067780	7070100	How's that sound?
7070100	7071100	Yeah.
7071100	7077700	Um, there are going to be free offerings, including a disc jam and tear away unfolded.
7077700	7088540	Um, also included is earth defense force 2025 under night in birth exe, I guess late, whatever
7088540	7094820	the fuck that is severed for Vita and Lumo for Vita, um, with cross by on PS4.
7094820	7100220	Um, this goes live on the seventh, which is to use a day.
7100740	7108420	Um, and also Disney stop, stop.
7108420	7113500	Disney wants to reboot Tron with Jared Leto.
7113500	7114500	Yeah.
7114500	7119660	Cause that worked out so well when they put Jared Leto as the joker in suicide squad.
7119660	7121100	She wasn't bad as the joker.
7121100	7125100	Like Jared Leto is just kinda everywhere.
7125100	7127140	I don't, I don't get it.
7127140	7128140	It's like one of those things.
7128140	7133980	And again, I didn't see suicide squad refer to our earlier conversation now.
7133980	7141860	So riddle me this, if Tron legacy, if Tron legacy was so bad that they can't warrant
7141860	7145360	a sequel, then why are they rebooting it?
7145360	7150500	Why warrant another movie then if it was the whole thing, make the fucking third Tron movie,
7150500	7152220	just make that movie.
7152220	7156260	Everything I've heard is that star Wars killed Tron.
7156260	7159980	When Disney got star Wars, they didn't need Tron anymore, so they threw it away.
7159980	7164500	But now it seems like somebody's thinking maybe that wasn't such a good idea that maybe
7164500	7171180	gasp both these movies could exist in the same place where Marvel's spitting out two
7171180	7172900	or three movies a year.
7172900	7177660	Surely Disney can put out two science fiction movies that may I point out are really fucking
7177660	7178660	different.
7178660	7180620	Are Tron and star Wars that similar?
7180620	7181620	I don't fucking think so.
7181620	7186740	They left it open to like at the end of legacy for like a really interesting like story.
7186740	7188100	Let's just throw that out.
7188100	7191740	I had heard this thing that Jared Leto was maybe supposed to be like another character
7191740	7192740	in the third.
7192740	7193740	I'm totally cool.
7193740	7194740	Fine.
7194740	7195740	Cool.
7195740	7199580	Although I thought they had totally set it up for Cillian Murphy.
7199580	7200580	Killian Murphy.
7200580	7201580	I forget how to pronounce his name.
7201580	7205420	They totally said that guy that played the scarecrow, who was awesome in that original,
7205420	7207420	in that first Batman.
7207420	7210500	But he was supposed to be the new villain, right?
7210500	7213260	He'd set up as the guy from the first movie's kid.
7213260	7216260	So he would be the villain in the third movie.
7216260	7219500	So I mean, like there, the plot was fucking there.
7219500	7220940	Make that movie.
7220940	7223940	Why do you need to reboot Tron?
7223940	7226340	I don't doesn't make sense.
7226340	7228580	It doesn't seem like that would, I mean, I don't know.
7228580	7237660	It just just, I, I'm happy if Tron can at least continue somehow, like I'll take a reboot
7237660	7241460	over nothing, but I'm not hyped about it.
7241460	7246860	Like, if they're worried that too much time has passed since Tron Legacy, they waited
7246860	7250020	like 25 years to make Tron Legacy.
7250020	7254140	So, so fucking what if like seven years have gone by since Tron Legacy?
7254140	7255380	Make a third Tron movie.
7255380	7256680	It will be fine.
7256680	7257680	And you know what?
7257680	7258780	Put a ride at Disney.
7258780	7263280	Take the ride from, so I don't have to go to China, take the ride at Shanghai Disney
7263280	7268600	and put it at California adventure or something because I want to go on that ride.
7268600	7273240	Anyway, Tiger Claw in chat says, maybe that's what the movie is going to be called Tron
7273240	7275560	rebooted or Tron reboot.
7275560	7276560	Oh, get, get it?
7276560	7280280	Cause it's play on computer stuff.
7280280	7281360	That's where the confusion was.
7281360	7286880	Maybe the third movie is just going to be Tron reboot and Oh, what a mind fuck that
7286880	7287880	is.
7287880	7290520	If that's the case, maybe that's just the third movie is Tron reboot.
7290520	7292720	All right, moving on.
7292720	7295520	Let's travel around and look at what's in stores this week.
7295520	7296520	Loki.
7296520	7300840	Although I wouldn't be too, um, too optimistic about it.
7300840	7302800	So this week, uh, not a whole lot.
7302800	7310360	Uh, we've got Altair, uh, Furis, the alchemists of, and the mystery, mysterious journey.
7310360	7313000	It's on PC, PlayStation four and the Vita.
7313000	7320280	Lego worlds out on PC, PlayStation four and Xbox one near automata on PlayStation four
7320280	7325880	and Tom Clancy's ghost recon wild lands on PC, PlayStation four and Xbox one.
7325880	7326880	That's it.
7326880	7328120	All right.
7328120	7331040	Let's travel over to Japan and look at what's coming out in Japan.
7331040	7336120	Um, this week starting on the, I think the ninth is when all the games hit.
7336120	7337120	Yep.
7337120	7340220	Kingdom hearts, HD 1.5 and 2.5 remix.
7340220	7341220	That's a pretty big deal.
7341220	7342880	That's hitting the PlayStation four in Japan this week.
7342880	7345200	I'm looking forward to the U S release of that for sure.
7345200	7346800	Uh, let's see.
7346840	7351040	Croylier Sigma comes out in Japan this week on PlayStation four, let it die.
7351040	7353440	Gets an uncle prime edition in Japan this week.
7353440	7355800	I'm assuming because that's a free to play game.
7355800	7359240	There's some type of box diversion that comes with game credit or something like that.
7359240	7363200	There's a green camouflage colored controller coming out this week as well for the PlayStation
7363200	7367720	four and ultimate Marvel versus Capcom three gets a Japanese release this week.
7367720	7368760	I thought it was already out there.
7368760	7372320	Maybe this is some type of box diversion over there as well.
7372320	7377120	Um, moving on to the Nintendo 3DS, I think is pretty slow this week.
7377120	7380880	Yeah, no, I mean, Nintendo has obviously been focusing on the switch, which I'm not sure
7380880	7383360	we have anything to report on the switch this week.
7383360	7384360	No, we don't.
7384360	7386320	I'm not starting to see switch releases fill in for Japan yet.
7386320	7388240	Uh, that's probably going to take a little bit.
7388240	7392680	And as we know, the Indies online is kind of what's really going to try to carry a Nintendo
7392680	7394520	through these first few months here.
7394520	7396680	So that's it for Japanese releases.
7396680	7399040	How about the United Kingdom?
7399040	7400040	Nothing.
7400040	7401040	Nothing.
7401040	7402040	Nothing.
7402040	7405680	I guess when a new console comes out, that kind of takes the attention for a while.
7405680	7407600	Nothing else happens.
7407600	7409040	Tumbleweed is rolling by.
7409040	7411920	All right, let's go to the mailbag.
7411920	7417440	Every week you guys email us at participate at orange lounge radio.com and dark soccer
7417440	7423840	dives in the mailbag and finds an email that she thinks, Hey, I'm going to read this on
7423840	7424840	air.
7424840	7425840	Dark soccer.
7425840	7426840	Do we have email this week?
7426840	7427840	I think we have one, right?
7427840	7428840	We will.
7428840	7429840	Yeah.
7429840	7430840	One actually came at the end of last week.
7430840	7431840	So I'm just going to read it.
7431840	7440440	It's from Y Y R it's labeled floater and the body is, this is a crusty poop heart Aaron.
7440440	7441640	That's disgusting.
7441640	7445160	But I think that's because you said something about throwing poop emails in the mailbag
7445160	7446160	or something.
7446160	7447160	Maybe I said it.
7447160	7448160	I don't know.
7448160	7449160	Thanks.
7449160	7450160	Gross.
7450160	7451160	We got another one from Fabrice from Belgium.
7451160	7452160	Just real quick.
7452160	7453160	I'm just want to throw this out there.
7453160	7457800	If you ever do end up coming up with a pixel shits too, I think the subtitle floater would
7457800	7458800	be appropriate.
7458800	7464320	It should be pixel shits too, should be turds in a river.
7464320	7466440	Next thing you have to sink the floaters.
7466440	7470240	All right, that's telling him how to live his life.
7470240	7471240	Hello.
7471240	7477680	O L R. I wonder what is your go to your to go game when you want to relax a game with
7477680	7483080	no stress, something easy going yours truly Fabrice from Belgium.
7483080	7485600	Skyrim H D remastered.
7485600	7486600	Yeah.
7486600	7489480	The Skyrim remastered is your go to answer for everything.
7489480	7491140	It's pretty well, it's just relaxing.
7491140	7497160	It's what I do the relax cause it's not really that hard.
7497160	7500900	For me, it could be the MMO, Final Fantasy 14, although that's not always a relaxing
7500900	7504880	thing if I'm trying to do like, you know, content that's, you know, newest and greatest
7504880	7505880	it's like farming.
7505880	7506880	And wow.
7506880	7507880	Yeah.
7507880	7509920	Well there's some of the like Zen things you can do.
7509920	7513360	You know what's always been a very Zen game to me, like just kind of get in the mood and
7513360	7518620	just, you know, do whatever Minecraft is a game like that for me actually digging holes
7518620	7519620	with that music.
7519620	7520620	Exactly.
7520620	7521620	Yeah.
7521620	7523520	I actually think I find Minecraft to be a very relaxing game.
7523520	7530200	Now granted, I don't play on super hard difficulty, but I don't play on, um, what is it peaceful
7530200	7531840	mode or whatever they call the creative.
7531840	7532840	Yeah.
7532840	7533840	Creative.
7533840	7534840	I don't really play in that mode either.
7534840	7538000	I do play in the survival, but I play on like the lowest difficulty setting.
7538080	7542160	So it's like, there's a creeper once in a while who's going to piss me off, but it's,
7542160	7543480	it's manageable.
7543480	7545280	So I like Minecraft for game.
7545280	7549560	Um, sometimes music games, I mean, it's been a long time since I really been able to just
7549560	7551840	pop in, beat me into 2DX and do that.
7551840	7556360	But even something like rez right now is kind of like that Zen thing for me.
7556360	7557360	Animal crossing.
7557360	7558360	Oh, is that your answer?
7558360	7559360	Yeah.
7559360	7563520	I mean, I kind of, I've kind of slacked off on it cause I need a new game to keep up with,
7564040	7567360	but I've really enjoyed, you know, just about every animal crossing is something that's
7567360	7569880	really relaxing and hanging out.
7569880	7571680	It's just really easy.
7571680	7576840	And then of course my reoccurring addiction to bust a move or puzzle bobble.
7576840	7581440	You know what else for me is relaxing is watching other people play video games on Twitch, honestly,
7581440	7586280	like sometimes I just want to lie on the couch and watch somebody else play a game.
7586280	7587280	So I do that too.
7587280	7589000	I have Dan for that.
7589000	7590000	There you go.
7590000	7595080	See, no, actually it's kind of stressful as I'm like, you just missed the thing.
7595080	7597920	Go no, go, go backseat driver.
7597920	7602320	If you don't fucking crouch and shoot that goat in the head, I'm leaving and he'll be
7602320	7607080	like promise.
7607080	7608600	This is what gaming is like in my house.
7608600	7609600	Yeah, no, no.
7609600	7613120	Um, see, Alan does most of his gaming on computer, so I can't exactly just be like, what'd you
7613120	7614120	do?
7614120	7617620	And I will do that once in a while, but I can't really like watch him play, uh, oblivion,
7617620	7621300	which I know is what he's doing right now because he played the shit out of Skyrim.
7621300	7626000	Then he played this shit out of Morrowind and obviously what was left is, well, he played
7626000	7627000	five and three.
7627000	7628080	When's he going to do four?
7628080	7631300	So now he's making his way through oblivion right now with mods galore.
7631300	7636080	So you know, though I do have an account for elder scrolls online and I probably should
7636080	7641140	play it so that, you know, I didn't care for it, but I'm willing to give it another shot.
7641140	7642900	It's been a while since I tried it last.
7642900	7645300	I keep promising Tiara that I'll play more of it.
7645300	7646300	Oh yeah, she's, she's super.
7646300	7649100	Someone should be playing well with me.
7649100	7650700	Somebody should give me money to do that.
7650700	7651700	You know what?
7651700	7652700	I'll do it.
7652700	7653700	No, don't do it.
7653700	7654700	Don't do that.
7654700	7655700	I'm threatening it now.
7655700	7656700	No, don't.
7656700	7657700	That's mean.
7657700	7663660	Besides, wait for the mass effect thing to wear off because I'm not going to get a month
7663660	7665180	out of it with mass effect on the horizon.
7665180	7668780	Wait for that to wear off and then, and then we'll think about that.
7668780	7669780	All right.
7669780	7671780	Is that it for the mailbag?
7671780	7672780	Yeah.
7672780	7673780	All right.
7673780	7676620	Let's get to some other gaming news and then we're going to get to your calls.
7676620	7679020	Orange Lounge Radio on Skype, but first Loki.
7679020	7682940	See, this is the kind of thing that makes me wish I could go to GDC because of this
7682940	7684060	kind of stuff.
7684060	7689500	So Microsoft revealed, um, they're one of their first, remember they were, I think,
7689500	7694900	was it said, um, God, I'm trying to remember when they announced the, like their headsets
7694900	7698700	that they were coming, but I know it was relatively recent that they announced that they're going
7698700	7701980	to be developing some actual VR headsets and stuff.
7701980	7707060	Um, but anyways, one of the first ones that they were talking about, of course, um, Acer,
7707060	7712780	ASUS and Dell were going to develop mixed reality headsets and they showed off the one
7712780	7713780	from Acer.
7713780	7718260	And so apparently if you went to this event, you also got one of the free dev kits, which
7718260	7723780	I totally would want, um, but then what the Acer windows, uh, mixed reality development
7723780	7731260	edition, it has two screens that are 1440 by 1440 and a native 90 Hertz refresh rate
7731260	7733900	built in audio and a headphone Jack.
7733900	7740860	Plus what's kind of cool is it, uh, doesn't require, um, any, uh, built in tracking.
7740860	7750060	So it's going to basically allow developers not have to extern or, or rely on external,
7750060	7754700	um, tracking, you know, like they have with like the vibe and stuff like that.
7754700	7759500	So it's gonna, I guess it has some way to track built on in the actual headset.
7759660	7764020	Um, the little video that they kind of showed demonstrating, it looks neat.
7764020	7768020	It's more of like kind of what they were showing with the whole windows holographic, where,
7768020	7771300	you know, more of like an office setting, you know, you can have it interact with the
7771300	7772300	stuff that's in your room.
7772300	7779020	I mean, they have like a picture in this of like Skype and some virtual dog thing.
7779020	7783580	And you know, I don't know, outlook or something like that.
7783580	7788540	Not too exciting, but I still think I'm pretty excited by like doing that virtual offices
7788540	7790060	would be pretty sweet.
7790060	7794780	Um, no word when they're actually going to be released, but it's neat to see that stuff
7794780	7801220	is coming along and hopefully with that coming along, it won't require such a powerful PC
7801220	7802220	to run.
7802220	7807100	Uh, the other cool thing, Oculus announced that they're cutting the price of the Oculus
7807100	7810420	Rift and touch bundles to $598.
7810420	7812340	That is down $200.
7812340	7818260	Plus not only that, you can get the controller set, um, for $99 instead of $199.
7818260	7819260	Wow.
7819260	7820260	They're still allowed to sell them.
7820260	7821260	Good point.
7821260	7825860	I actually thought about them like they're trying to get rid of those as quickly as possible.
7825860	7829180	That was my first thought is like, wow, they're going to try to sandbag this shit before they
7829180	7830740	can't sell them anymore.
7830740	7831860	It's kind of interesting.
7831860	7835740	Although obviously I would hope that doesn't happen, but you know, I mean that lawsuit
7835740	7838200	was kind of interesting, fascinating.
7838200	7841900	So they're saying though, um, you know, they're talking about also as I mentioned, you know,
7841900	7845780	expensive PC, the village nowadays, so with the hardware it's coming out, it's getting
7845780	7846780	cheaper and cheaper.
7846780	7848540	They own a PC that can actually be VR ready.
7848540	7849540	Yeah.
7849540	7852700	So they're saying that when the Oculus first came out, you know, PC like that would cost
7852700	7857160	about a thousand dollars nowadays though, it's about 700 and they said you can even
7857160	7860620	get by with a PC that's built for like 400 at minimum specs.
7860620	7868500	So that's not bad, not bad at all, but definitely need to do I get up off my ass and redo what
7868500	7874380	I wanted to do here in the studio with a upgrade in OLR because I'm very curious with the new
7874380	7878380	AMD Ryzen chips that they had come out to see those are supposed to perform pretty well.
7878380	7883880	So I, and they're cheaper than the Microsoft chips or you know, the Intel chips.
7883880	7887580	So I don't know, I'm a kind of an Intel fanboy.
7887580	7893120	I've got AMD in my laptop and I don't really care for it too much, but the Ryzen chips
7893120	7894120	sound good.
7894120	7899800	I'm going to our chat over at live.vognetwork.com I'm still fascinated on this whole relaxing
7899800	7900800	game talk.
7900800	7901800	There's been a lot of talk in there.
7901800	7903860	I've just catching up while he was reading that story.
7903860	7906060	So back to back on the relaxing thing for a minute.
7906060	7909660	Brad from Pod Culture suggesting No Man's Sky is a great Zen game.
7909660	7911640	Yeah, that game had a lot in common with Minecraft.
7911640	7915900	Like I understand that game is riddled with controversy, but you know, again, we've talked
7915900	7919620	about this to death, but for what it is, there's a lot to enjoy about it.
7919620	7922740	And yeah, there's definitely a lot of relaxing stuff in No Man's Sky.
7922740	7926020	Kossen in chat says Stardew sounds like it could be my Zen game.
7926020	7927020	Oh yeah.
7927020	7929260	A lot of people are into Stardew Valley for that for sure.
7929260	7931800	Dungeon Buster agreeing Stardew is pretty Zen.
7931800	7934080	You don't need to rush into stuff and you can just grow things.
7934080	7935920	Do they have that out on the Switch already?
7935920	7936920	I know that was...
7936920	7937920	It's coming.
7937920	7938920	It's not out yet.
7938920	7939920	It wasn't a launch title.
7939920	7940920	Pardon me.
7940920	7941920	It wasn't a launch title.
7941920	7946360	They were saying that it is going to be the first place you can do multiplayer.
7946360	7948180	Stardew Valley will be on the Switch.
7948180	7950520	So that's what Nintendo is getting.
7950520	7951520	That's a little special.
7951520	7957360	Sg100mata is pointing out, I remember at Magfest where they did yoga for gamers, they played
7957360	7959520	Minecraft music during it.
7959520	7965040	JD saying Mini Metro is a good Zen game.
7965040	7968000	William Murderface says Terraria is my chill game.
7968000	7969000	Gotta mind them 2D pixels.
7969000	7971760	Yeah, kind of like a 2D version of Minecraft.
7971760	7974880	My relaxing game of course is Until Dawn Rush of Blood.
7974880	7976600	It's not relaxing at all.
7976600	7979120	It can't be if you played it enough.
7979120	7984120	That's like saying I'm going to go play Resident Evil 7 just to chill out and relax a little
7984120	7985120	bit.
7985120	7986120	That's a nice easy evening.
7986120	7987120	Stress free.
7987720	7993440	I'm going to play Slenderman just to, you know, chill out.
7993440	7994440	I have the hiccups.
7994440	7995440	This is the worst.
7995440	7996440	All right.
7996440	7998080	Let me try to get through this story.
7998080	8002120	One of the games that is on the Switch for launch is Shovel Knight.
8002120	8007880	I haven't picked this up yet because I already own Shovel Knight on I think PlayStation 4
8007880	8008880	and Wii U.
8008880	8012800	So I was kind of like, do I really want to buy this game again?
8012800	8016000	But this Shovel Knight, they have Specter of Torment separately, right?
8016000	8017720	The prequel or whatever it is.
8017720	8021720	They have that separate, but this Shovel Knight actually has all the original DLC included
8021720	8024780	with it, which is pretty cool.
8024780	8030460	And also with Shovel Knight, they are actually allowing you to do gender swapping in this
8030460	8032640	new version of Shovel Knight.
8032640	8034960	Although they're calling it body swap.
8034960	8035960	I should be clear there.
8035960	8043240	It's called body swap, but you can actually change the look and the text of Shovel Knight,
8043240	8048680	Shield Knight, Black Knight, Plague Knight, and Propeller Knight to be male or female.
8048680	8054640	So you could be a male Shovel Knight trying to save a male Shield Knight, or you could
8054640	8059120	be like a female Shovel Knight trying to save a male Shield Knight or whatever the hell
8059120	8061080	it is that you want to do.
8061080	8063640	You can change that in the characters.
8063640	8067280	What's cool is there's been a whole little like, kind of like looking into how these
8067280	8071820	characters were designed, then you actually get to see a little bit that goes into it
8071820	8076620	where it's not just like the female versions have a bow in their hair.
8076620	8077620	They're very different.
8077620	8078660	And sometimes it's very subtle.
8078660	8082660	Like when I look at the female Shovel Knight, I have a really hard time seeing the difference,
8082660	8085820	but there is, there is a difference and they kind of, they point out some of the stuff
8085820	8086820	there.
8086820	8091140	So does female Shovel Knight have more boobs or I mean, yes, but it's not like over the
8091140	8092140	top.
8092140	8097340	I mean, yes, women have breasts, so there is a breast area, but it's not like dead or
8097340	8098840	alive breasts.
8098840	8100840	You know what I mean?
8100840	8101840	Yes.
8101840	8102840	I get it.
8102840	8107960	It's what you would expect a normal woman to look like in a, but in a, in a Knight outfit.
8107960	8112840	Nobody ever said dead or alive was set on earth, so.
8112840	8117160	And sometimes the fun way to play it is with gravity from the moon, right?
8117160	8123120	It's just gravity from the moon, only in the chest area that that's really everywhere else.
8123120	8125920	You know, it's, it's its own thing.
8126000	8131160	Uh, let's see, SSU 100 Matt says, it's funny that Shane all of a sudden is going crazy
8131160	8132160	over Shovel Knight.
8132160	8135680	Now he's not here to defend himself, although I've told him he can come on the show whenever
8135680	8137800	he wants.
8137800	8142720	But yes, I think it's funny too, cause I tried to like play that game before for him, but
8142720	8146280	now that it's on the Switch, Shane is all about the Switch.
8146280	8149800	I almost wish he was here tonight to kind of be a nice little counterbalance to maybe
8149800	8153600	some of the negativity cause Shane is like nothing but positive on Switch right now.
8153600	8159200	So maybe I'll get him here on a future week, but now that Shovel Knight's on the Switch,
8159200	8160200	he's checking that out.
8160200	8162200	So interesting.
8162200	8169800	All right, moving on, let's get to another story from Dark Sakura.
8169800	8173640	There is some smart garbage out there.
8173640	8179640	It's actually a trash can that has a game built into it.
8179640	8187800	So it's called the Tetra bin and it basically rewards you for throwing away garbage by having
8187800	8190420	a little game built into it.
8190420	8196120	I couldn't see too much about it, but like pretty much the way that it works, it looks
8196120	8198820	almost like it's got a duck hunt screen on it.
8198820	8206120	And when you drop your can in, there is a, like a, birds will like go and try to catch
8206120	8209200	the garbage on the digitized screen.
8209200	8213480	And they, and there's like dogs and bats and oh yeah, they're bats, not birds.
8213480	8215360	They fly around going, feed me, feed me.
8215360	8220960	And so when you feed them, you get a code that can be redeemed on the Tetra bin website
8220960	8227120	so that, um, you can get like stuff in the mail, like freebies and samples and things
8227120	8228120	like that.
8228120	8231720	So the cycle never ends.
8231720	8236580	But the whole thing is it's meant to encourage other people to get into the habit of picking
8236580	8239420	up trash that you see around and throw away.
8239420	8242860	So which everyone should fucking be doing, actually, everyone should just be throwing
8242860	8244700	away their own garbage.
8244700	8245700	Don't leave your shit.
8245700	8246700	Throw it away.
8246700	8247700	There's a trash can.
8247700	8249780	And don't leave your dog shit either.
8249780	8251480	Yes, that too.
8251480	8256020	If you don't have a trash can handy, put it in a bag or something and then wait until
8256020	8257020	you can throw it away.
8257020	8261220	It's not that fucking hard, but anyway, it's, it's a good incentive and I think it's a cute
8261220	8262220	idea.
8262220	8265780	So, but the real question is, can you install Linux on it?
8265780	8266780	Probably.
8266780	8267780	I bet it's running on Linux.
8267780	8268780	Yeah.
8268780	8269780	I was gonna say it's probably running Linux.
8269780	8270780	That's true.
8270780	8271780	It probably is.
8271780	8272780	That's it on that.
8272780	8273780	All right.
8273780	8274780	Just a couple more stories for you guys.
8274780	8278020	And then the Skypline at Orange Lounge Radio.
8278020	8285020	So Riot Games has won a lawsuit against a website called LeagueSharp and LeagueSharp
8285020	8292640	was a website running, um, it allowed you to sign up for $15 to $50 a month for access
8292640	8297760	to numerous bot scripts that would allow players to perform maneuvers that they would,
8297760	8302080	you know, be very difficult for them to do otherwise in League of Legends.
8302080	8305600	And so of course, you know, they went after them because that's, you know, a big no-no
8305600	8311440	and, um, they won $10 million.
8311440	8314560	$10 million?
8314560	8315560	That's a lot of money.
8315560	8316560	Yep.
8316560	8317560	Wow.
8317560	8324400	Being that they won the, uh, you know, websites no more.
8324400	8327400	But that software is still out there for people to use, right?
8327400	8329120	I'm just kidding.
8329120	8331120	Once on the internet, always on the internet.
8331120	8333080	All right.
8333080	8335520	Um, so, uh, yeah.
8335520	8340720	Don't, don't write cheat programs for games that rely on these things to make money, right?
8340720	8342560	Or you might find yourself in court too.
8342560	8343560	Don't cheat in online games.
8343560	8344560	There you go.
8344560	8345560	That's a very good way of putting it.
8345560	8346560	Don't cheat in online games.
8346560	8347560	That's very good.
8347560	8348560	All right.
8348560	8349840	I'm going to try to get through this.
8349840	8353880	I have hiccups though, and this is the worst possible thing that could happen on the radio
8353880	8354880	in my opinion.
8354880	8357040	But, um, anyway, I'm trying, trying to get through this.
8357040	8362040	Um, the, uh, this week launched the Video Game History Foundation.
8362040	8363960	Um, this is pretty cool.
8363960	8368880	Uh, being launched by a former games journalist and developer, uh, Frank Sifaldi, uh, who
8368880	8373360	was involved with the, um, you know, what's funny is that was on a podcast he was on,
8373360	8374880	but we were on at different times.
8374880	8378520	And, uh, so we weren't like on there together, but like, I know they were promoting that
8378520	8381760	he was coming up next after me, um, or the other way around.
8381760	8385680	But anyway, he, he was involved with the, um, Mega Man collection.
8385680	8389120	So I know he does a lot with the retro video games and, uh, I want to say, didn't he drop
8389120	8392400	hints that there might be something else coming with that whole Mega Man thing?
8392400	8395040	Well, uh, anyway, he does a lot with video game restoration.
8395040	8403660	I think the, also the story that was going around about the joust game that Iwata had
8403660	8405780	been involved with on the NES.
8405780	8406780	We talked about a few months ago.
8406780	8409340	I think he was involved with that as well.
8409340	8413220	So it seems like when there is a digging up something in video games past thing going
8413220	8415680	on, this guy does seem to be involved.
8415680	8420700	So yeah, this is a guy that seems to be a good fit for this, working with this Video
8420700	8421780	Game History Foundation.
8421780	8428020	It's a nonprofit organization dedicated to preserving the past of video games, not just
8428020	8435700	code, but the printed materials, advertisements, and other things that go into video games.
8435700	8438260	So the first project launched this week.
8438260	8445780	It's a digital archive of pamphlets and ads surrounding the NES's original launch in 1985.
8445780	8450500	So they are on Patreon if you want to support them there, or you can check out their website,
8450500	8455780	gamehistory.org, and you can actually do a tax deductible donation over there.
8455780	8460940	You know, this is something they are saying is important because, especially when it comes
8460940	8464740	to CD-ROMs, which was a huge era of gaming, right?
8464740	8468780	Our classic game of the week, part of that CD-ROM era of gaming, right?
8468780	8470900	CD-ROMs don't last forever.
8470900	8475900	And some of the CD-ROMs out there are really starting to break down, so they want to preserve
8475900	8481020	as much as possible of this so that future generations kind of know what the history
8481020	8482920	of video gaming looked like.
8482920	8486720	You know, unrelated to this, but maybe related a little bit, I was reading a story this week
8486720	8494040	about, I guess, like the old CRT televisions that go in old video game cabinets.
8494040	8495680	Like they don't make them anymore.
8495680	8500360	Like as of this past couple weeks, they don't make CRT TVs anymore.
8500360	8501360	They're done.
8501360	8507800	So if you want to replace like a TV in a video game cabinet and you can't get one to recycle,
8507800	8511960	you have to get like an LCD monitor, which isn't a pure way to do it.
8511960	8517400	You know, it's going to be different on an LCD screen versus the old CRTs.
8517400	8521600	So that is an era of gaming that's going away too.
8521600	8524200	Wasn't the process of making those actually kind of dangerous, and that's part of the
8524200	8525640	reason why they don't do it that way anymore?
8525640	8529560	Like there's like gas inside the tubes that make it run and all that stuff, right?
8529560	8531280	So I think that's a part of the reason why they don't do that.
8531280	8535120	Well, they were in a vacuum and if, you know, they had like really high capacitors in them
8535120	8539680	and stuff that you got to be careful to, you know, discharge that stuff before you start
8539680	8546600	working on them as you don't electrocute yourself, I mean, yeah, it's less than ideal,
8546600	8551160	but you know, it's still good, you know, good tech if you're into like, you know, fighting
8551160	8553320	games and stuff like that.
8553320	8557160	Dungeon Buster in chat says older magazines are also getting harder to come by, which
8557160	8562360	is why it's nice that places such as archive.org have a lot of these scanned copies there.
8562360	8563600	Yeah, that's very true.
8563600	8564600	All right.
8564600	8567640	Well, we're going to open up the Skype line right now.
8567640	8570480	It's time for you to give us a call if you want to talk about anything we've talked about
8570480	8574240	in this part of the show, or maybe the first part of the show, or whatever is on your mind
8574240	8575240	tonight.
8575240	8579320	Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype if you want to give us a call, and it's already
8579320	8580760	lighting up over there.
8580760	8581760	Let's get to it.
8581760	8582760	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
8582760	8583760	Who's this?
8583760	8584760	Hey, this is Akdeft.
8584760	8585760	Hey, Akdeft.
8585760	8587760	How are you, my friend?
8587760	8590760	I'm doing okay, mostly.
8590760	8595480	Yeah, I know you were one of those people that got screwed by Amazon, huh?
8595520	8602840	Yeah, one of the many, but I want to focus on something really great that we talked on
8602840	8604600	Twitter the other day.
8604600	8606040	Sure, go for it.
8606040	8614720	Yeah, we were talking about, well, Breath of the Wild, that's an American dub.
8614720	8621920	And while it's not something new that games have recently done, at least in the past few
8621920	8629200	years it has grown, I'm still really happy to see that Nintendo has adopted this onto
8629200	8632600	their games.
8632600	8639080	And I was not hearing about only Breath of the Wild, also Want to Switch also has Latin
8639080	8640600	American dubs.
8640600	8649280	So it's really awesome to see that game companies, even right now Sony and Microsoft, back in
8649280	8655240	the 360 days, it's something that they have done.
8655240	8665880	And as a person that, well, speaks English and also Spanish in the native way, it's really
8665880	8675680	good to see that they're adopting this to sell their games on other countries.
8676680	8685000	Yeah, the back and forth that we were having on Twitter was that you had posted a clip
8685000	8690920	of your Overwatch play of the game, and I noticed that it was using, obviously, the
8690920	8694000	Latin American language.
8694000	8700440	And I thought it was neat because it kind of emulates that robotic voice that goes,
8700440	8701720	play of the game.
8701720	8704320	It says it in Spanish instead.
8704360	8706960	And then it kind of got me thinking about how, oh yeah, you have all these other voice
8706960	8711160	actors who kind of emulate the whole like McCree going, it's high noon, you know, probably
8711160	8715280	saying it in a very similar way, but in the Latin American dialogue, this is kind of interesting
8715280	8717200	to me to listen to that sometimes.
8717200	8722880	And I watched the Twitch screens, the streams on Twitch, where they have like Japanese voice
8722880	8726120	acting and all that stuff as well, which I think is neat.
8726920	8736600	Yeah, also Blizzard did the, well, sorry, did the Overwatch dub for Latin America, and
8736600	8742880	many other countries, it has so many dubs in many languages that it's pretty amazing
8742880	8745880	to see.
8745880	8752400	And something curious, because at least in PC, you can have like the English text and
8752400	8762480	have another language be the voice, like have it in Japanese or have it in Spanish.
8762480	8769600	And again, it's really great to see something like this and, sorry, I'm going to repeat
8769600	8776720	myself again, but it's really amazing to see because it's something that, even in the PlayStation
8776720	8784800	2 era, like in that generation, we did see games in Spanish, but many developers were
8784800	8792920	like really, really lazy and used Spaniard, the Spanish that is used in Spain, which it
8792920	8802640	ain't that much different from Latin America, but it does sound different and we don't use
8802640	8808680	in Latin America the same language they use in, or at least the same words.
8808680	8813440	There's a whole like, there's a whole verb conjugation that you don't use in Latin America
8813440	8815080	that they do in Spanish, right?
8815080	8816080	Vosotros?
8816080	8818680	That doesn't even exist really in Latin America, right?
8818680	8827040	Yeah, in Spain, sorry, they use vosotros, which is basically like you and plural.
8827040	8834560	What we use in Latin America, what is status, that is you plural for us, so yeah, it's not
8834560	8841080	even the same and it's another verb conjugation and again, it is said that we don't understand
8841080	8848960	it because it's like something that was teach even, not even like 30 years ago, so maybe
8848960	8854660	some people do know about it, but still, it sounds weird, so well, again, it's something
8854660	8862900	like really, really lazy because they didn't even give a chance for a Latin American dub
8862900	8867380	or even a translation or adaptation to be done.
8867380	8873100	JD's asking in chat, I'm curious about Latin American localizations, do they pick a country's
8873100	8880580	dialect to standardize on since there's some variation between Caribbean, Central American,
8880580	8884620	but wouldn't that be, I mean, technically you could say even within North America, the
8884620	8890500	USA, somebody in California is going to sound somebody different from somebody in Alabama,
8890500	8891500	right?
8891500	8896700	Dark Sakura, sometimes her Alabama sidekicks in, right, versus in the Northeast where somebody
8896700	8901920	might say Wicked Awesome, which is like not something you hear here ever, so, you know,
8901920	8903980	like there's little things like that, right?
8903980	8910240	I mean, yeah, yeah, but there's definitely things like that and sorry for the interruption,
8910240	8919080	but yeah, we in Mexico, we have even like so many dialects, so many accents also, but
8919080	8925680	speaking like of Latin America as a whole, pretty much each region, Mexico, Central America,
8925680	8932120	South America have distinct accents, so it's not necessarily the same and not even the
8932120	8941840	same use of words, but most, at least as of recent, most companies, speaking of movies,
8941840	8951040	television, and all that, and now games, try to use like a neutral standard, neutral Spanish,
8951040	8960760	so it doesn't use like words that we maybe use in Mexico that aren't used in other countries.
8960760	8965560	Like hella, we say hella in Northern California, but nobody else says that, so we wouldn't
8965560	8968160	put hella in a video game.
8968160	8976000	Yeah, and that's like your character is from California and you're gonna try to emphasize
8976000	8983000	that, but other than that, like for example, and I'm gonna put the example of McCree, since
8983240	8994240	he's a cowboy, he does have like a typical Northern Mexican accent, somewhat, so at least
8994760	9001760	he doesn't use that many words, like specialized words, or, I lost the word specifically for
9005360	9012360	it, but, like idioms, or, sorry, but yeah, you get the idea.
9014000	9021000	But yeah, there's the voice actor for Lucio in Latin America, he does like this fake Brazilian
9024560	9031560	accent too, so yeah, it sounds funny also, and it's really great to see stuff like this
9034800	9041800	and to talk about this, because it's something that I really appreciate as a translator myself.
9042200	9046280	No, I think it's really fascinating, I think it's cool, I like to just listen to the games
9046280	9052320	in the other languages and hear those small nuances and things like that, and yeah, I
9052320	9057960	think it's great that it makes the game more accessible to other players, which I think
9057960	9059320	is a great thing, of course.
9059320	9061480	Oops, excuse me, still have those hiccups.
9061480	9067260	But the problem is, or not the problem, but the interesting thing with Zelda is that there's
9067260	9072340	not a lot of dialogue that they're going to have to localize either, well, the written
9072340	9077900	dialogue, yes, but the voice acting isn't everywhere, I mean, it's still weird to hear
9077900	9084560	voice acting in a Zelda game at all, but they still use the general, like, uh, uh, like,
9084560	9088820	in some places, like those little noises, they use that a lot.
9088820	9093040	But there is definitely some scenes that are voice acted, and yeah, it's kind of interesting
9093040	9097220	to hear in the Zelda series, but now our friends in Latin America will get to hear it in the
9097220	9098620	in their native language.
9098620	9107700	Yeah, and hopefully Nintendo doesn't cut this trend, like, oh, it's only for this few games.
9107700	9114220	I hope to see this become a trend, like, probably with Xenoblade, it would be, like, really
9114220	9121120	awesome to see, with Xenoblade 2 coming this year, to see, like, a Latin American dub.
9121120	9127440	So hopefully, but we'll see, at least, uh, we're taking, the game companies in general
9127440	9133320	are taking steps toward, uh, localizing stuff, like, for region, not especially specifically
9133320	9136800	for language, so that's really, really great.
9136800	9137800	Baby steps.
9137800	9138800	Yeah.
9138800	9139800	Alright.
9139800	9143520	Act F, I'm gonna let you go, but thanks so much for the phone call, my friend.
9143520	9144960	Hey, thanks for having me.
9144960	9147600	Thank you, bye-bye.
9147600	9151680	Orange Lounge Radio on Skype, if you want to give us a call and, uh, talk to me while
9151680	9153080	I have the hiccups here.
9153080	9155440	Let me check in with Loki to see if there's any last minute stories.
9155440	9159880	Sure, yeah, we can talk about a few things, so how about the games that are coming out
9159880	9161440	for PlayStation Plus in March?
9161440	9162800	So you're gonna get Tearaway-
9162800	9165720	I think Dark Soccer covered those during Rapid Fire.
9165720	9167800	My mistake, wasn't paying attention.
9167800	9175440	Alright, and then how about, uh, we talk about, uh, the campaign here, so the GoFundMe campaign
9175440	9182480	for a new Nick Arcade show, um, starring, uh, Phil Moore is gonna be launching, and
9182480	9188600	that's for, uh, Battle Arcade, and it's supposed to be kind of the same type of premise, um,
9188600	9189600	that's awesome.
9189600	9197080	I'm down with that, especially with that reboot of, uh, Starrcade coming back as well, so.
9197080	9198080	And-
9198080	9199080	Everything old is new again.
9199080	9200080	Yeah.
9200080	9204200	And then the other thing, um, you know, just kind of a PSA, I guess, um, don't put adhesives
9204200	9209160	on your Switch console, because I guess it takes off the paint, because of whatever paint
9209160	9214280	or coating they put on it, it's not as durable as some of the other systems out there.
9214280	9217360	Be careful with that stuff when it's not officially licensed, for sure.
9217360	9221360	Well, even, yeah, I mean, dbrand is the one that kind of pointed that out, because they're
9221360	9226920	developing skins for that console, and they're like, hey, you know, we've, you know, got
9226920	9231260	the retail version, and we found that it's been pulling paint up, so we're canceling
9231260	9234160	all your orders for that stuff, you know, just to let you know, don't do that.
9235120	9237120	Which is kind of nice of them.
9237120	9238640	Please do not do that.
9238640	9239640	Alright.
9239640	9243780	Well, um, our phone's not really ringing, so I think I'm going to go ahead and shut
9243780	9245320	it down and wrap up the show tonight.
9245320	9248120	My hiccups are going crazy, so I think it's time to, uh-
9248120	9249240	We didn't do a fuse.
9249240	9250800	I think it's time to shut that down.
9250800	9252360	You need to do some FUs tonight, Darzagra?
9252360	9253360	Yeah.
9253360	9254880	Alright, let's get to it then, before we say goodnight.
9254880	9256360	The FUs of the week!
9256360	9278760	FU to Sinus Infections, and FU to dealing with Kaiser over all of this shit.
9278760	9280480	I'm ready to be done.
9280480	9281680	Fuck it.
9281680	9285560	Also, FU to not being able to finish an entire cool damn fight.
9285560	9290000	FU to the hiccups.
9290000	9293760	What did I do to deserve this, other than maybe drinking water a little fast?
9293760	9296520	Because I was trying to get to the next story.
9296520	9300360	Man, Loki, do you have anything to get off your chest tonight?
9300360	9305280	I just wish I hadn't eaten 11 breadsticks, other than that, I'm fine.
9305280	9307160	Look at this, FU to 11 breadsticks.
9307160	9308800	Maybe like 6 breadsticks next time.
9308800	9313400	I always say 6 breadsticks, but then I'm like, I'm so hungry, and I mean, I was hungry
9313400	9316200	not to eat 11, so, you know, 6 might not have been enough.
9316200	9317720	Pretty hungry, it's pretty hungry.
9317720	9320920	Alright, that is going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
9320920	9323720	Thank you guys so much for tuning into our show tonight.
9323720	9326360	If you like what you heard here at Orange Lounge Radio, please tell a friend or five
9326360	9327360	about the show.
9327360	9331520	Help us spread the word, we don't have any big magazine behind us or anything like that.
9331520	9334720	Word of mouth is all we got, so we can be the show where every gamer has a voice, but
9334720	9337920	only if the voices are here to air on air.
9337920	9341760	A nice five star review on a place like iTunes goes a long way as well.
9341760	9345280	If you have not yet written a review for the show on iTunes, please consider doing
9345280	9346280	that.
9346280	9347640	I really, really, really appreciate that.
9347640	9352360	Again, not asking you to donate money or anything like that, just take 15 seconds to write a
9352360	9353360	review.
9353360	9354480	It would be awesome.
9354480	9356560	Really appreciate that.
9356560	9357560	That's going to do it.
9357560	9362520	Let's go around and get everybody's final thought for the night, Dark Sakura.
9362520	9368540	I really am enjoying the new Jessica Jones comic, which really goes into the regular
9368540	9371040	Marvel universe and not the TV series.
9371040	9372220	Only worth a read.
9372220	9374640	Also resist.
9374640	9378040	My final thought is, I'm sorry, I'm not going to be doing streaming after the show tonight,
9378040	9381640	even though I wanted to start making that a regular thing after last week went very
9381640	9382640	well.
9382640	9387040	Thank you guys for checking that out at Twitch TV slash Rob Roberts, cheap plug.
9387040	9392200	But I'm actually going to get a new monitor for my studio so I can fix some problems that
9392200	9394080	I'm having with the ratio.
9394080	9398880	And I haven't had a chance to test the switch broadcasting yet, so I'm not ready to do that
9398880	9399880	yet tonight.
9399880	9404760	I'm hoping that I can do maybe some Blaster Master next week or whatever game I decide
9404760	9405760	I want to do.
9405760	9408480	But yeah, so I'm not going to be doing that for the show tonight, which is fine anyway
9408480	9414340	because my hiccups are, yeah, I need to go lie down and breathe into a paper bag or something.
9414340	9417820	So anyway, last but not least, Loki, your final thought.
9417820	9422400	My final thought is, I'm tired.
9422400	9424320	That's it.
9424320	9428000	Alright, right, that's going to do it for another episode of Orange Launch Radio.
9428120	9430120	Thank you guys so much for tuning in tonight.
9430120	9433480	We will see you in seven days to do it all over again.
9433480	9436820	Until then, don't be a jerk to people online.
9436820	9437820	Don't give people the hiccups.
9437820	9438820	And have a good night.
9438820	9439320	Bye.
9458000	9462200	The hiccups in this program do not necessarily reflect those of the staff of Orange Launch
9462200	9467000	Radio or VOG Network, but you know they were all still true.
9470000	9471000	See you next week.
9488000	9490000	See you next time.
