0	27000	This week, Harmonix officially announces its next release, DropMix, allows anyone to bring out their inner mashup artist and create the amalgamation they always wanted. This is just one of tonight's stories, so stay tuned for so much more, starting right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.
28000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
32000	46000	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio. Live tonight, episode number 679 of our show for this March the 12th of 2017.
46000	62000	My name is Rob Roberts, joining you live from Studio N7 in Sacramento, California, where we're live every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com, 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show. I hope you all made it back here with the time change.
63000	72000	I also hate that whole losing an hour of sleep with daylight savings time as much as the rest of you do, but I'm not going to lie, the hour of daylight is nice. It is still light in the OLR studio.
72000	75000	I've just taken one hour of your life. How does it feel?
76000	80000	Surprisingly, Dark Sakura has not turned to ash with all the daylight in the studio.
81000	93000	You want to know what's funny? I even drove with the windows down and the sun blaring on my freshly washed purple hair and listening to Lady Gaga. I still have perfect illusion in my head because I was singing with it.
94000	95000	Sure, sure. Get on with your bad self.
96000	99000	With what voice I have because I actually have enough voice to attempt to sing today.
99000	110000	I know you're still kind of plagueish, but you sound just fine. You sound recovered even though I know you're still having treatment for that sinus infection from hell or whatever it is you've been going through.
111000	125000	I still hurt, but I'm feeling remarkably better. My voice just wears out still quickly, so I've been preserving my voice, drinking warm things, and apparently I have a legit Stroopwafel, which I freaking love legit Stroopwafels.
125000	139000	Yes, our guest tonight actually brought Stroopwafel to the show, and this is hilarious. So I was talking about it on Twitter, and I got followed by the official, or I don't know if it's official or whatever, it's some redistributor of all these Stroopwafel products.
140000	147000	I mean, they're overseas, so it costs an arm and a leg to actually have them sent over here. But yeah, it's just funny, which by the way, we're going to get to an email.
148000	153000	We're going to get to an email tonight that may blow your mind. We may have been saying Stroopwafel wrong this whole time.
153000	154000	Stroopwafel?
154000	157000	Yeah, we're going to get to that later in the email segment, so we'll get to that later.
157000	158000	But it's Stroopwafel.
158000	167000	We'll see, we'll see. I'll leave you with that teaser. Anyway, this episode of OLR is brought to you by The Dark. Also, we're sitting in the dark tonight. We don't have our usual light on because it's kind of warm in here.
168000	170000	It's 76 degrees outside.
170000	179000	Yeah. When did summer show up? Like we went from like three weeks of nonstop rain where I thought we would have to build an arc in order to do OLR and then suddenly it's like, hi, summer showed up.
180000	183000	So anyway, but global warming, not a thing. Just so you know, Dark Sakura. Anyway.
184000	185000	I will say this.
185000	186000	What? Then I got to introduce the other guy.
187000	193000	And eating the Stroopwafel. Sweet things still taste like soap to me. However, the aftertaste is delicious Stroopwafel.
194000	195000	There you go.
195000	209000	So I am quite pleased that yes, I do have a very large amount of dove taste in my mouth and not the delicious pigeon type bird that people would eat in the Victorian era when they were poor.
211000	215000	But it is delicious and the texture is amazing. I love Stroopwafel.
216000	225000	I'm being yelled at by chatters. Hi, chat over in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com. Again, Sunday nights live after Bobby Blackwolf at the Voicegeeks Network, vognetwork.com.
226000	236000	Rama in chat says, fuck your summer weather. We got a nor'easter blowing down my door. Yeah, I heard. Meanwhile, while we're trying to deal with the heat, like they're saying like 18 inches of snow, which I guess is a lot.
236000	247000	I mean, like you just put flakes here in California and works and schools close everywhere. But 18 inches of snow, I guess in the middle of, I hope I'm getting that right, in the middle of New York.
248000	256000	Which sounds right, though, because I remember a couple years ago was when I went to PAX East, right? And PAX East was this weekend, right?
256000	268000	And there was still like Boston was having their hell snowmageddon thing going on, which is probably every year. But this was like bigger than most the last time I was at PAX East. So this still this still sounds right to me. Anyway.
269000	283000	In mobile, yeah, one year. I mean, it will snow like every so often, like an inch. But people treat it like it's a freaking hurricane. Actually, they treat it worse than it's a hurricane. You can find no bread in the store. You have to live on hot dog buns.
284000	295000	All right. Well, look here to rock you like a hurricane. Say hello to Techmaster Loki. Hello. Hi, Loki. How are you? I'm fine. Yeah, good. Good. You didn't bring food to the show tonight. I was shocked. I was like, what's going on here?
296000	311000	That's because I diet. No, I know I was making Irish stew. So I had just finished cooking at about five. So I just didn't have time to like I was cooking it for a while. So I was like, I'm just gonna cook.
311000	323000	Yeah, I do that all the time. Nice. I Irish stew. Does that mean lots of bacon and Guinness and Irish stew? It's just potatoes and carrots. And you can put Guinness in the. No, no, no.
324000	335000	When I made it, we did Guinness in the broth. He probably wants his kid. I mean, I guess alcohol cooks out, but he still probably wants. No, it's not like a beer broths, you know, stew or anything. That's just straight up, you know, onions, carrots.
335000	346000	And I usually put like celery in there as well. And garlic, even though it doesn't call for garlic crock pot, you got to get one more crock pot meal in before winter's officially over. Basically, it was a crock pot on the stove.
347000	359000	So did that. And then, of course, on top of that, we recommend it is that you also make an a herb butter that you can pour over the potatoes. So I poured that over. It was fucking. You should you should have a cooking show on YouTube.
359000	368000	I think you would know, I would think people out there would not guess that Loki like cooks like this. And you would I think you do very well with the cooking show recipes.
369000	383000	Except I didn't measure anything. Cooking with Loki. It's not that hard. It's not just follow the recipes. God. That would be the show is that Loki is having to supervise someone else cooking and Loki just gets very angry like follow the recipe.
384000	386000	That would be a lot of fun.
387000	391000	You know that there is a channel that's cooking with Cooking Mama.
392000	393000	Really?
394000	402000	Yeah. And that's actually what gave me the inspiration that to make pizza because I watched him make pizza and it looked actually kind of good. So I made pizza.
403000	404000	Is that a is that a Twitch thing?
405000	406000	No, it's on YouTube.
407000	411000	OK, because I know Twitch has the whole cooking section now, too, or at least eating. If they have eating, they surely have cooking.
411000	413000	I think you should do. Well, I can make a channel based on that. That's easy.
414000	415000	There you go. There you go.
416000	418000	It'll be entitled like each episode. Special K again.
419000	420000	OK.
421000	422000	Some days I don't want to make anything.
423000	429000	I think you should do something like the walk with Jan where you have like an apron that's got a different like bacon pun on it.
430000	432000	But his raw like walk puns like walk on the wild side.
434000	435000	I like it. Do you remember that show?
436000	437000	It's long.
438000	439000	Jan can cook that one? Yeah, Jan can cook.
439000	440000	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
441000	444000	Maybe it was called something else, but it was like Martin Yan was his name.
445000	449000	Yeah, he's got a he had a few different shows on PBS. I only remember Yan can cook, but he had other ones.
450000	453000	He also had like a restaurant, I thought, or like a chain of restaurants or something.
454000	457000	I never saw more Food Network in my life than the years I lived with Loki.
458000	459000	I said my mom, the Martin Yan cookbook.
460000	463000	Of course, Food Network game works. You don't have cable, but you know.
464000	465000	Well, these are the pre Netflix days, too.
466000	467000	So, you know, it was Food Network and Chill.
467000	468000	It wasn't Netflix and Chill.
469000	470000	It was like Food Network can get hungry.
471000	474000	All right, I got to introduce our guest here tonight.
475000	476000	Oh, very, very familiar voice on the show.
477000	479000	It's been probably been at least a month or two since we've heard from him.
480000	481000	But welcome back to the show tonight, JD.
482000	483000	Hi.
484000	485000	Hi, JD. How are you doing?
486000	487000	I'm pretty good.
488000	489000	Yeah, good. Good to have you back. How are you doing?
490000	491000	Don't forget to get that microphone nice and close so we can hear you.
492000	493000	Otherwise, it's a struggle.
494000	495000	I'm doing pretty well.
495000	496000	I appreciate that.
497000	498000	Great. I'm glad you like him.
499000	500000	So JD actually didn't bring the Stroopwafel with him.
501000	502000	He had it shipped here from. Did you get it on Amazon?
503000	504000	I got it on Amazon.
505000	511000	So which is funny because that's not the first time in 2017 Stroopwafel has magically shown up at my doorstep.
512000	513000	Not that this is a trend I'm upset with at all.
514000	519000	I mean, like, you know, we don't beg for donations or T-shirt sales or anything like that here on OLR.
520000	521000	I mean, we really should, but we don't.
522000	524000	But if you want to pay us a Stroopwafel, I really can't complain.
525000	535000	So, I mean, cool. But so this box shows up on my doorstep, but it has my stage name on it because you all know Rob Roberts is my real name, but it's just the name I've had online for years and years.
536000	543000	So it has my stage name on it. And I'm like, okay, somebody sent something to the house that knows my address, but doesn't know my real name.
544000	549000	And so I opened it up and I, you know, first, you know, Alan's like, well, is it ticking?
550000	554000	No, it's not. So I went ahead and opened it up and I saw what it was, but there was no packing slip.
555000	558000	There was nothing in there besides the Stroopwafel to let me know who sent it.
559000	563000	I just forgot to mark it as a gift because I assumed that Amazon would say who it was from.
564000	569000	So no, it didn't. So I had to like write this tweet, like, well, thanks for whoever sent the Stroopwafel.
570000	572000	I have no idea who you are. And then when you showed up, you were like, oh yeah, it was me.
573000	575000	For all I know, you're just taking credit for it. No, I'm kidding. I'm kidding.
576000	577000	Well, I know you're a man of your wood.
578000	581000	I know you're a man of your wood. You have the receipts. Good, good.
582000	583000	So what's new with you?
584000	585000	Not a whole lot.
586000	590000	Any adventures to arcades lately? You told me, since it is a video game show, we should get off food and get on video games for a minute.
591000	593000	You've been traveling around to Bay Area arcades, right?
594000	598000	Yeah, so Dave and Buster's recently opened up, maybe like just in the next city south of me.
599000	603000	So I've been going there fairly regularly and they have the latest DDR version, Ace.
604000	608000	So I got myself an EMU's card and I've been tracking scores and it's been fun.
609000	611000	Yeah, but they don't really have any other music based games.
611000	612000	They have grand piano keys.
613000	616000	That's the ticket spinning game? I rule at that game. I love grand piano keys.
617000	626000	When they first set it up, it was right next to the DDR machine, so the two of them are almost competing because two music games next to each other is a problem sometimes.
627000	630000	But then they moved it the next time I was there and now it's a giant Pac-Man.
631000	636000	I feel like my whole life playing Beatmania type games prepared me to win a lot of tickets and grand piano keys.
636000	646000	If you haven't seen grand piano keys, you guys, it's this giant oversized piano that you would imagine a 7-year-old would just go crazy banging on the keys because it's like this gigantic keyboard.
647000	649000	And they do, and so forth. But you're supposed to follow the notes on the screen.
650000	655000	Well, you know what? It's also fun to be a 38-year-old banging on these gigantic keys.
656000	660000	It's really relaxing. You can go at your own tempo. The key to doing it is...
661000	662000	No, you gotta go fast. Gotta go fast.
663000	664000	Well, that's what I mean.
664000	665000	Do you want tickets?
666000	670000	You know, you have to read the notes and stuff, but it's not like a timing game like most of the music games that we play.
671000	677000	Akuma JP says, like, the big movie. No, but it's not one with your feet. See, when you think of big, you think of the one with your feet.
678000	683000	This one's more elevated, like you're sitting at a piano bench. It's a lovely concert you're going to and you sit at the piano bench.
684000	685000	But would you say that the keys are comically large?
686000	688000	Yeah, there's only four of them and it's huge.
689000	690000	Hilariously large.
690000	692000	So, yes. Yeah, there's only like four keys on the keyboard.
693000	694000	Four keys per player.
695000	697000	Oh, well that's just easy. You just need two doubles, right?
698000	699000	I know, right? Yeah.
700000	701000	Come on, I grew up on seven keys.
702000	703000	Four?
704000	705000	This thing dropped it down to four. This is for babies.
706000	707000	If they had a doubles, I would be playing it.
708000	709000	I know, they need the doubles mode. It'd be awesome.
710000	714000	Anyway, I'm glad to hear you're having fun still touring the arcades in the Bay Area.
715000	716000	I have to check out this Dave & Buster's that's new.
716000	720000	I always only knew the one in Milpitas as far as Bay Area is concerned.
721000	723000	And then they built the one here in Roseville, which is sad.
724000	726000	It's a sad Dave & Buster's. It's small.
727000	731000	You can go to the Dave & Buster's because it's in Daly City and then you can go to the Steak & Shake, which is almost next door.
732000	736000	Fuck yes, that's great. Steak & Shake is still a novelty to us here in California.
737000	739000	That Daly City one is the first one in California, right?
740000	742000	I haven't had Steak & Shake, but I like Steak and I like Shake.
743000	744000	It's all about the banana chocolate combo.
744000	748000	It's also, temper your expectations, it's not actual steak. It's a steak burger.
749000	750000	Steak burger, yeah. I'm fine with steak burger.
751000	752000	But they're good and they have amazing onion rings.
753000	754000	I go there for Chili Mac.
755000	757000	God, food with you people all the fucking time.
758000	759000	We gotta get into video games because that's what we're here to talk about.
760000	765000	Video games, gamer culture, and the gamer lifestyle every Sunday night live with you guys at vognetwork.com.
766000	768000	Kick off topic tonight, start things off.
769000	773000	I want to talk a little bit about a company that's been in the news a lot this week.
774000	780000	A lot. And this is something that's really been shifting gaming culture quite a bit over the years.
781000	782000	And that is Twitch.
783000	787000	I don't know if you guys realize, Twitch has been in the news a lot this week.
788000	792000	So last week we talked about the whole fact that they were going to start selling games.
793000	794000	That was a big shift for Twitch.
795000	797000	But it's also, it's totally logical.
798000	803000	And even though we kind of, I voiced my concern with the system is that only these larger streamers are getting rewarded.
804000	805000	The smaller streamers aren't.
806000	809000	I do still feel like there's time for Twitch to kind of hear all that and process that.
810000	811000	And we'll see what ultimately comes of that.
812000	813000	I'm not taking any of that as like the final word.
814000	816000	But then there was a lot more that came out on Twitch this week.
817000	823000	For example, I'm going to start with something a little more negative because this is really unfortunate.
824000	829000	But you guys may have heard of the marathon streamer who is streaming on Twitch who passed away in the middle of his stream.
829000	833000	He was 22 hours into his 24 hour charity stream and he passed away.
834000	836000	And I'm not here to joke or make light of that situation.
837000	838000	It's really awful.
839000	846000	But the unfortunate thing is the way we kind of obsess with media or what have you, this type of news information gains a lot of speed.
847000	853000	And it gets a lot of re-blogs and so forth that like, OMG this guy passed away while he was doing a marathon.
853000	860000	Well it kind of, it also kind of blows the situation out of proportion because my understanding is the guy had stepped away to have a cigarette.
861000	865000	And that's when he passed out and ultimately passed away.
866000	872000	And I apologize, I don't have the source in front of me, but I think it was heart related complications probably from staying up for so long.
873000	879000	And potentially, I don't know, but potentially having just pre-existing health things that maybe were coming into play here.
879000	884000	And I'm thinking if he stepped away to have a cigarette, he probably felt something was coming on.
885000	890000	So my point is, thank God it didn't happen on camera because people are sick and you know, but anyway.
891000	894000	So despite the fact that that's not such a good thing, it's a very bad thing.
895000	903000	It's gaining a lot of traction and clicks and people are realizing like wow, a lot of people watch this Twitch stuff that happens live.
904000	906000	And they are there to watch the unexpected moments.
906000	915000	Obviously that is not an unexpected moment you're tuning in for, but you know, just the, on a lighter note, the sillier things that happen, the unexpected moment.
916000	924000	Which, this didn't happen on Twitch per se, but a perfect example of something that very well could have happened on Twitch was that guy that was on the BBC or something doing a live interview.
925000	928000	And then his kid comes in through the door and you know, is like crashing the interview, right?
929000	932000	That video is everywhere this week, right? Because people like to see when things go wrong.
933000	935000	And that kind of stuff happens on Twitch like all the time, right?
936000	937000	That whole type of thing.
938000	948000	Anyway, this is causing Twitch to show up in the mass media, like NPR did a whole little feature on Twitch this week, you know.
949000	956000	And even though I think we as gamers and folks that consume gaming media on the regular, we're all very familiar with Twitch.
956000	968000	Well, let me ask this. How much do you watch Twitch or other, when I say Twitch, my umbrella that encompasses Beam, YouTube, Live, and the other stuff too.
969000	973000	How much do you do the streaming? Yes. How much do you watch that stuff? Dark Soccer, do you watch that stuff?
974000	975000	Not at all.
976000	977000	Really?
978000	979000	No, not really.
980000	981000	But you guys do YouTubes, don't you?
982000	985000	No, but I'm going to be starting it up. Dan and I are talking about basically just recording us arguing while playing games.
986000	989000	Well, people said they'd listen to it, so whatever. I've streamed though.
990000	991000	Yeah.
992000	997000	I'll pick a game that I'm like, okay, this game is WTF worthy. Like, I did the entirety of Hot to Full Boyfriend.
998000	1003000	And now, yes, I dated Pigeons and played the final scenario.
1004000	1005000	Oh, I have all the achievements.
1006000	1008000	Took four hours. Oh my god, but it was great and fucked up.
1009000	1010000	I wanted a sequel.
1010000	1018000	Well, there's the other ones. There's Holiday Star, and then there's a couple others, which I have now, and I'm planning on doing Holiday Star next.
1019000	1023000	So I will stream, but sometimes it's kind of boring for me to watch other people's streams.
1024000	1031000	And I don't like to listen to people talk over games. It's just annoying to me. I would rather enjoy the game.
1032000	1035000	So I will look for long plays on YouTube instead.
1036000	1037000	Ah, okay.
1037000	1041000	Unless it's like, play along with me, and then they want your input.
1042000	1046000	And some people like having you talk to them. I guess that's okay.
1047000	1053000	When I stream, I talk and I interact with the listeners, but I'll tell you my pet peeve. This is what I don't do.
1054000	1057000	My pet peeve is reading dialogue boxes in silly voices.
1058000	1059000	Yeah, that's annoying.
1060000	1064000	But however, I'm not shading you if you do do that because I know other people that love that.
1065000	1066000	I know other people that love that.
1067000	1068000	I just, I don't.
1069000	1074000	I think Markiplier is annoying. He is, you know, maybe an okay person.
1075000	1080000	He's got a nice voice. I loved his Five Nights at Freddy's one because those were meant to be entertaining.
1081000	1084000	But I don't really like many of his other videos, and I don't find them really that funny.
1085000	1088000	I've only seen one video of his. I don't know the guy to be able to say anything positive or negative.
1089000	1091000	If he's doing charity streams, then that's positive.
1092000	1093000	Yeah, I'm okay with charity.
1094000	1103000	So, but like, the ones that I think are really entertaining are the ones that add something to the game.
1104000	1109000	You know, ones that are an interactive element but not overshadowing the game.
1110000	1114000	It's not necessarily about the player. You are a part of the experience.
1115000	1118000	And they are there to bring you into the experience in a way you wouldn't normally be.
1118000	1124000	So that is kind of where I am about those streams. I don't know if I'm the only person in this room that feels that way.
1125000	1134000	I don't really watch Twitch, although more recently I have been watching a little bit of it just because of my day job, which is ironic.
1135000	1138000	But I haven't even really watched too much of that.
1139000	1143000	Preferably, I normally watch stuff on YouTube, but not even live stuff. It's more rebroadcast.
1143000	1151000	The most you'll see me watching actual streams would be kind of like, Awesome Games Done Quick rebroadcasts, or the archives of those.
1152000	1163000	So I'll watch those occasionally, and I'll watch like, occasionally, I forget the guy's actual name, but he goes by CarlSagan42 on YouTube.
1164000	1171000	He does a lot of the very technical Mario Maker levels. He also speedruns Mario games and stuff like that.
1171000	1179000	So I don't remember the guy's actual name though. But I watch him. He's pretty entertaining. Although I haven't been watching him pretty lately.
1180000	1181000	But, I don't know.
1182000	1191000	I like those things too. When it adds to the experience of the game. Like, when they're explaining what they're doing in a speedrun, or like you're doing talking about the technical aspects of it.
1191000	1201000	Well it's great because he'll play through the levels, and then at the very end when he's like, he'll figure, like you're kind of watching with him and he's figuring it all out, then he'll just break the world record for it.
1202000	1208000	Because that's what he doesn't. Like he just speedruns the solely technical level and gets the world record for each one of them. Just kind of funny.
1209000	1216000	I guess I must watch much more of the livestream stuff than you do. I find, you know, I probably watch more of it at this point than I do Netflix, to be honest.
1216000	1228000	Like, you know, especially if I'm just kind of bored and hanging out on the couch, I'll fire up the Playstation 4. Especially if friends of mine are broadcasting. I'm ten times more likely to watch, like if a friend of mine is live, I'll just go tune into the stream.
1229000	1233000	Because it's kind of like you're hanging out with a friend long distance, right? That's kind of what this show is in a way.
1234000	1242000	I would love to do more streaming if it wasn't going to totally annoy my wife because, you know, I'd be talking and so it'd be interrupting whatever she's doing.
1242000	1247000	But if I had my own room that was soundproof that I could actually do that, then hell yeah I'd do that.
1248000	1250000	We need the Nelly commentary Twitch channel.
1251000	1253000	No we don't. Actually, I don't think we do.
1254000	1265000	Well, obviously I enjoy doing the livestreaming more and more, but I've been watching more and more too and I actually have been dipping in more and more often to strangers and people that I don't recognize.
1265000	1275000	Just because none of my friends are streaming and so I just want to watch somebody play Overwatch or something and maybe it's somebody, sometimes I even watch streams that aren't in English.
1276000	1283000	Like just to kind of hear the voiceovers and dubs in another language and just to hear and just kind of see competition around the world I think is really interesting to me.
1284000	1291000	So I've been watching more of it than I was probably a few years ago. In fact, I would think I probably was one of the people in the very beginning that was like,
1291000	1298000	who wants to watch somebody else play a video game? I'm sure you can probably go back to old OLRs and hear me saying that, but opinions evolve, they change.
1299000	1304000	As more and more people get in there and do things with it, you start to see the other sides of it at the end of the day.
1305000	1307000	So I think I came full circle and I really became a fan of the whole thing.
1308000	1318000	But it's just interesting how much more mainstream stuff that now Twitch is starting to get with, they have this whole NPR thing as well.
1318000	1329000	Sorry, I'm reading in chat over at live.vognetwork.com. Dungeonbuster in chat says it's hard though, not all streamers are as entertaining to me, but their gameplay can also be great background noise, especially if they're playing something obscure.
1330000	1344000	Bobby Blackwolf in chat, who you might remember, used to host a show called Friday Night Gaming that was, in a way, really ahead of its time because that show was playing live video games and doing the show over it, but this was before Twitch had really taken off.
1344000	1348000	I think Justin TV was still on, but Twitch hadn't really taken off yet.
1349000	1356000	So Blackwolf says, I got told that all the time, that's why Friday Night Gaming got cancelled. Nobody wanted to watch other people play video games on the internet on a Friday night.
1357000	1361000	The store didn't want anything to do with it, nobody wanted to be the one playing, and only a couple dozen people watched online.
1362000	1369000	So it's like it was one of those things where it was an idea ahead of its time, and I'm not sure what finally made that take off.
1369000	1379000	I don't know, I don't know if it just became, as Bobby you were kind of mentioning as you scrolled up, you only need a quarter of the software today than you needed back then.
1380000	1394000	Maybe the technology and the fact that it's so easy for anyone to do so that it can be instead of strange people that I don't know on the internet at all doing it, it's like my friends and people that I know from great distances are doing it, maybe that helped break down the walls.
1394000	1403000	Well yeah, and also the equipment, because before you used to have to have a capture card and all the software and a PC running set up to do all the streaming and everything, and now these consoles have it built in.
1404000	1405000	That's very true, some of them.
1406000	1407000	Well all the modern consoles do.
1408000	1409000	The Switch doesn't yet.
1410000	1411000	Like I said, all the modern consoles do.
1412000	1424000	But it's very easy to set up the Switch on streaming, I'm going to stream on the Nintendo Switch after tonight's show, so it's not impossible to do. Getting the Wii U set up was harder, honestly.
1425000	1426000	I have to completely derail us for a second.
1427000	1428000	Uh oh.
1429000	1436000	I went looking on eBay for a game that I wanted my collection, and I found something. I linked it to you. I linked it in the chat room.
1437000	1438000	What is this?
1439000	1440000	Who's got $79,000 handy?
1441000	1444000	$79,000? What is it? Is it a sealed copy of Stadium Events or something?
1445000	1446000	Uh, it might be included.
1447000	1458000	Okay, what is this? So on eBay, massive huge video game mega collection, 122 console systems, plus 3 coin ops. What the heck?
1459000	1460000	60 peripherals and 3 coin ops.
1461000	1463000	Somebody's cleaning house. Okay, but it's being sold out of Italy.
1464000	1465000	Yeah, but still.
1466000	1467000	That's going to be way too much shipping.
1468000	1469000	50 bucks. But still.
1469000	1473000	I mean, if you have $79,000, 50 bucks of shipping isn't going to make that much of a difference.
1474000	1475000	Jeez Louise.
1476000	1484000	Yeah, I figured that was worth a momentary derailment for. I maybe have half of that, and the other systems in there are a lot of European systems, too.
1485000	1489000	Boy, I wonder why somebody would completely gut their collection like that, or maybe it's a game store that's gone under.
1490000	1493000	Oh, there are multiples? It actually looks like it was a library. They have an XI there.
1494000	1497000	If you wanted to start some retro game store, though, here's all you need to get started.
1497000	1509000	It looks like a few special edition systems to Japanese Saturn and American Saturn. Yeah, there are multiple versions of the system, just different iterations of it.
1510000	1515000	Including a DDR second mix for Dreamcast, which I have.
1516000	1520000	You'd be set to stream for life if you bought this thing. But anyway, back to streaming for a minute.
1521000	1524000	No, that's okay. JD, what's your take on streaming? Do you participate with it?
1524000	1533000	I haven't really gotten into it. Mostly, I mean, I don't find myself with all that much free time sometimes, and usually I'm like, well, if I have time, I could be playing games or I could be watching them.
1534000	1537000	And I usually just fall on the side of playing them, because I have so many games in my backlog.
1538000	1549000	I guess I didn't realize I was the only one that was really participating in that stuff on the regular. Well, something might bring you guys into the fold soon enough. Who knows?
1549000	1561000	Anyway, something else that Twitch has launched somewhat recently is Twitch IRL, which the NPR article also got into was talking about how now people stream real life stuff on Twitch, which is hilarious.
1562000	1572000	Because, of course, those of us that were around when Justin.TV was around saw this go the other way, that Justin.TV was set up to be an IRL thing, that then the video game section really took off and Twitch kind of dominated the conversation.
1572000	1586000	They ended up essentially closing Justin.TV, although I know when they first launched IRL, they really tried to set out, here's the differences between the two, but come on, it's still kind of funny in a way to see the IRL lead to Twitch lead back to IRL.
1587000	1591000	I just thought that was interesting. Well, anyhow, there's still other news about Twitch and what's going on.
1592000	1602000	Twitch also streams IRL programs. Like, they had the Bob Ross thing not that long ago, right? And that was awesome. Did you guys not watch the Bob Ross thing?
1603000	1604000	I did not watch the Bob Ross, but it sounded awesome.
1605000	1607000	I used to watch Bob Ross when he was on PBS, so I've probably seen them all.
1608000	1610000	I watch Bob Ross on Netflix nowadays.
1610000	1622000	But it's something else to say, you know, like when Bob Ross is going, I'm going to beat the devil out of that brush, I'm just going to beat the devil out of that brush, to see the chat light up going, devil wrecked, RIP devil, devil get fucked, you know, all this stuff.
1623000	1626000	You know, because along the nice things that Bob Ross does.
1627000	1635000	Well, Twitch is going to be hosting, get this, a 17-day marathon of the Power Rangers. Is Shane out there from Ranger Pride?
1635000	1644000	Surely, and he watches more streaming than I do. I'm sure he's aware of this and Captain Spike over there at Ranger Pride, but they're going to be doing a 17-day marathon of the Power Rangers.
1645000	1652000	It's going to start on March 15th, run through the 30th, 23 seasons and 831 episodes of 19 different television series.
1653000	1660000	The whole thing, I think, is supposed to be a lead up into the movie, of course, which they're, aren't there like Krispy Kreme Power Rangers donuts at this point?
1661000	1662000	Like, they're really trying to get the marketing out there for the Power Rangers.
1663000	1664000	So the movie was already out.
1665000	1668000	The 24th is when the movie, there's like a new movie, are you aware?
1669000	1671000	Yeah, the new live action one, but I thought that came out back in January.
1672000	1677000	No, trailer did, but the movie's finally going to be here just a couple weeks, so that's a pretty big deal.
1678000	1683000	So yeah, that is something you can check out there. That's going to be on the Twitch Presents channel.
1684000	1691000	That's going to be part of Twitch's monthly subscription offering, but if you're an Amazon Prime person, which a lot of you are, you're going to just have that built in.
1691000	1697000	So, let's see, going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com, Bobby Blackwolf says,
1698000	1704000	The Bob Ross chat room was the only time I enjoyed watching Twitch chat just because I thought the spamming was hilarious.
1705000	1712000	Yeah, during that Bob Ross thing, it was hilarious. There is a lot of toxic stuff that happens sometimes in Twitch chat.
1712000	1716000	For example, chicken in chat says more like racist ranges.
1717000	1724000	But I gotta say, I was actually, I was just watching Twitch over the weekend, actually.
1725000	1732000	And I was watching a streamer I was not familiar with at all, and I don't even remember his name, but I know he was overseas because he had an accent, and he was playing Overwatch.
1733000	1739000	And somebody, I didn't watch, I wasn't watching the chat, but somebody I think was acting up in his chat and saying like nasty things.
1739000	1745000	But I thought it was really cool that this dude bro-ish guy shut it down.
1746000	1751000	Like he said, come on dude, that's not cool, don't say that kind of stuff or you can't hang out here.
1752000	1759000	I want this to be a positive place. And I was like, is this the internet that I know? Is this the Twitter view?
1760000	1765000	So, I have to applaud people on Twitch that don't put up with that shit.
1765000	1775000	And if you don't make a space for it and you let them know that that type of racist shit is not welcome here, then I think that's awesome that people are doing that.
1776000	1786000	And that just helps Twitch in the long run to get that bullshit out of their community, which is why a lot of people, not to get too off topic, but it's why a lot of people are still very frustrated with Twitter.
1787000	1794000	Because Twitter doesn't really take that same type of action against people that it probably needs to take action against.
1795000	1803000	I digress. Anyway, let's see. Dungeon Buster says, was it Flame Hopper? He's like a super positive streamer that plays H1Z1.
1804000	1808000	I honest to God don't remember the guy's name, but he was playing Overwatch and I think he plays Overwatch a lot.
1809000	1815000	I think that's like his bread and butter is that. Because he kept talking about how he usually streams competitive mode, but this particular day he wasn't.
1816000	1819000	He was streaming just quick plays. So, I thought that was really cool.
1819000	1826000	Anyway, so as if all that was enough, that's not the rest of the news. So, there's more stuff that Twitch was doing into this week.
1827000	1834000	So, Twitch is going to be launching, funny enough as I just said that Twitter can't seem to take a lot of the garbage out of it.
1835000	1843000	Twitch is going to launch a type of Twitter competitor. It's called Pulse. It's going to be a feed that updates photos, images, text from Twitch users.
1843000	1850000	Which essentially is going to be for people probably plugging their upcoming streams or maybe discussing gaming and so forth.
1851000	1854000	But it's going to be interesting to see how this IRL spin is going to be on it.
1855000	1858000	I don't think everybody is in Pulse yet. I think it's something they're slowly rolling out to people.
1859000	1864000	But it definitely seems like Twitch wants to go for some of that Facebook or Twitter money.
1865000	1870000	What do you guys think about Twitch trying to get into that whole social feed element?
1870000	1872000	How long before they duplicate Snapchat?
1873000	1877000	Yeah, how long before they duplicate, right? No, that's Facebook that keeps ripping off Snapchat at every angle.
1878000	1882000	Loki, do you think Twitch has an opportunity to take a bite out of Twitter and Facebook and all that?
1883000	1884000	They can definitely try.
1887000	1891000	Tigerclaw points out in chat, I believe Twitch has an automod thing to help moderate the chat. That is true.
1892000	1896000	You can choose how strong or soft you want that automod to be.
1896000	1902000	But you're right, I forgot about that. There is an automod system on there that is on, I think, a medium level by default.
1903000	1909000	So to get rid of the most garbage comments, but if you still want to have a little rough chat, you can have it.
1910000	1915000	Also, then there's Pulse, which we'll see what impact that has as it starts to roll out more.
1916000	1921000	And then, if you guys forgot, Twitch picked up Curse not that long ago.
1921000	1926000	Which, if you've played World of Warcraft in the past, you're probably aware of Curse because they did a lot of automods.
1927000	1930000	Darkstalker, do you use any of the Curse stuff to install your mods, or do you do it all by hand?
1931000	1932000	Yeah, I use Curse for all of my mods.
1933000	1934000	Well, I don't know if you know, but that's Twitch program now.
1935000	1936000	Yeah, I know.
1937000	1939000	So, coming out very soon, a rebranding of Curse, it's going to be...
1940000	1941000	They've already replaced the app.
1942000	1943000	Oh, have they replaced it with all their branding?
1944000	1947000	Yeah, they've already replaced it with all of the Twitch stuff, and honestly, it works far better than it did before.
1948000	1950000	Instead of having to pay for Curse Premium, it just works.
1951000	1954000	The official launch of the Twitch desktop app is going to be March 16th.
1955000	1960000	And so, now you hear this whole Twitch is trying to get into buying and selling the games directly.
1961000	1963000	Twitch is getting into trying to replace Facebook.
1964000	1968000	Twitch is already on the desktops of most World of Warcraft players, which is one of the biggest PC games out there.
1969000	1974000	You really start to see how Twitch is trying to get a lot more than just, come watch what we're doing.
1974000	1980000	Out of curiosity, Dark Soccer, since I haven't played WoW in a while, and Fallout SE 14 doesn't support add-ons, so Curse doesn't really use it,
1981000	1984000	does this Twitch app now try to encourage you to watch live feeds while you're on it too?
1985000	1986000	No.
1987000	1989000	Oh, interesting. I bet it will. It's going to be interesting if that's coming.
1990000	1993000	I just always keep up the add-on manager, so I never see it.
1994000	1999000	Interesting. Bobby Blackwolf in chat points out the Twitch desktop is going after Discord with that Apple.
2000000	2002000	It seems like everybody wants a piece of Slack right now.
2002000	2004000	Discord's freaking annoying.
2005000	2009000	Everybody wants a piece of that Slack right now. It's not just Discord, but it's Slack.
2010000	2014000	Google split Hangouts this week, right? Or they're going to be.
2015000	2020000	Hangouts is going to have their whole video component, but then their text component is basically going to be Google Slack.
2021000	2025000	Microsoft's got a Slack competitor they're working on as well. That's the whole new thing.
2025000	2032000	Slack is basically the IRC thing that you guys are participating with at live.vog.net.com.
2033000	2041000	Slack is just a modern version of IRC that has more support for when you paste in a link, it automatically shows you what the preview is.
2042000	2045000	You can insert photos in natively. It's a more modern version of IRC.
2046000	2051000	I'm in some ways kind of surprised. We here at VOG haven't tried to.
2051000	2057000	Well, actually, somebody asked me about that point blank once. Why haven't we tried to go to something like Slack?
2058000	2063000	A, that costs money. B, it's also harder to integrate. Something like Slack, you have to invite people to.
2064000	2070000	The nice thing about live.vog.net.com, it's built right into that page. You go, you sign in, you can use it.
2071000	2075000	If you misbehave, Bobby Banhammer Blackwolf will make sure you don't get to get in there again.
2075000	2082000	But it's built into the website very easy to get into. Where as Slack and Discord even, you kind of have to invite people.
2083000	2085000	Well, Discord has links.
2086000	2091000	But again, it's not really something that's built into websites, but I don't know.
2092000	2099000	With Slack, it's built with the workplace paradigm, so you have to trust everyone you invite. There's no abuse controls, so it can get out of hand a lot easier.
2099000	2106000	Yeah. Interesting. Bobby's perspective over at live.vog.net.com. Slack was started as the chat engine for an MMO.
2107000	2115000	The MMO died, but they learned the chat engine was marketable. Yeah. Or even IRC. I mean, do a lot of people still use IRC?
2116000	2122000	I think so. I think IRC is still popular with a lot of, especially more tech-savvy communities, I think are still kind of built in IRC.
2123000	2124000	What is our chat room running on?
2125000	2126000	No, I know, I know, but I'm outside of us.
2127000	2128000	Oh, well, we offer some things.
2129000	2132000	I've been using it since probably 2000 and, you know, off and on.
2133000	2140000	Yeah. I know, I know I used to use it a lot in college, but now it's really just vog stuff is really all I use it for.
2141000	2142000	I still keep up with my LiveJournal people on IRC.
2143000	2144000	Do you really? Yep.
2145000	2146000	I guess it's hard to let some things go, isn't it?
2147000	2153000	Because the LiveJournal, the fact that you're even still hanging with LiveJournal people says something because that website kind of...
2154000	2157000	Well, I mean, I don't use that site anymore, but the people are still around.
2157000	2161000	Yeah. And Tiger Claw in chat says, but it won't be long until we see vog on Curse or Discord.
2162000	2168000	No, no, no, I'm not saying anything like that is happening. I am saying that other people have asked me why we haven't gone that way.
2169000	2172000	And usually I'll just kind of, you know, that's not my department. Bobby does the tech stuff.
2173000	2178000	But no, but I also, I know very well the whole reason Slack wasn't going to work was the fact that we didn't want to have to invite people.
2179000	2182000	We wanted it to be an open door. That was a big barrier for the whole Slack thing.
2182000	2191000	So, I mean, I'm not going to say we're never going to go that direction, but there's going to have to be a compelling argument for us to fix something that's not broken.
2192000	2194000	Does that make sense? IRC and this whole thing, it's not broken.
2195000	2198000	So there has to be a compelling argument to evolve that, if that makes sense.
2199000	2203000	So anyway, yeah, I'm curious. Why do you dislike Discord, DarkSakura? I use it.
2204000	2207000	I hate it out of spite for all of those times I want to raid.
2207000	2212000	And it says, must have Discord. Fuck you. I don't want to talk to any of you people.
2213000	2215000	That's not Discord's problem. That's the community's problem.
2216000	2218000	And the fact that they rely on Discord for all of it.
2219000	2221000	I see. It's annoying. I don't want to be pigeonholed into it.
2222000	2229000	But all these people just, when I was playing, not even two years ago, it was Team Speaker Ventrilo. Just replace Discord with Team Speaker.
2230000	2233000	Why? Because it was easier. I liked it better. And I'm old fashioned.
2233000	2241000	No, the thing is, I just hate that it's become a requirement for so many things. Especially when my voice wasn't working.
2242000	2245000	Okay. No, I get that. So it's a different...
2246000	2247000	I hate the dependence on it.
2248000	2253000	Okay, so it's not the software you have a problem with. It's what a crutch it's become for some people, I suppose.
2254000	2256000	Yeah, exactly. And they only want it to be voice chat.
2256000	2262000	And I'm like, you can just as well type in the raid chat as you can in whatever their chat is.
2263000	2271000	Well, and without going too far down this alley, but I know this is an issue. Some girls don't like to get on voice chat.
2272000	2283000	Because, especially if it's strangers, some guys are trash when they hear a girl. Not all. Some become instant trash when they hear a girl get on the chat. Right? Am I right?
2283000	2291000	Yeah, but I'll tell you what is funny. We had a raid a couple weeks ago that was probably 70% women.
2292000	2302000	And this one guy just started being a shit and everyone just went off on him. It was like that lioness photo where they all attacked the lion. And then we booted him out.
2303000	2306000	So there's no room for that in my life.
2307000	2309000	Behave yourself, boys and girls. But everybody behave yourself.
2310000	2311000	The future is female.
2313000	2319000	Alright. Let's see. I'm looking in chat over at live.fognetwork.com.
2320000	2326000	Bonds006 says, DarkSakura, these kids and their newfangled chat programs. Back in my day, Yahoo chat was all you need.
2327000	2328000	I never used Yahoo chat.
2329000	2331000	Aim. Aim for life. AOL instant messenger.
2332000	2333000	ICQ.
2334000	2338000	What about just the fucking AOL chat rooms? Not even aim.
2339000	2345000	You know what's funny now is that when I went to what store? It was freaking 99 cent whatever store.
2346000	2353000	When you would go pay for something, the little register thing would go, uh oh. And I'm like, it's the ICQ sound. Oh my god, it's followed me.
2354000	2367000	Triggered by the past. I love it. Alright. Anyway, so yeah, I just wanted to kind of get into like, wow, Twitch has been in the press a lot lately and I want to talk a little bit about live streaming and what you guys all think of this.
2368000	2373000	What this could be for the future of, you know, because Twitch is a pretty big part of the gaming community.
2374000	2380000	And not, you know, I keep saying Twitch, Twitch, Twitch, Twitch. But we also know that YouTube clearly wants a piece of this.
2381000	2386000	You know, they've tried to launch their thing. And this whole Microsoft Beam is kind of a wild card right now, I think.
2387000	2394000	It depends how fast Microsoft kind of ramps that up. I'm very curious to see what they unveil at E3 that they might do with Beam.
2394000	2398000	Because Beam has the whole thing where you get rewarded for participating. You get the little sparks.
2399000	2406000	And usually that's just so you can play noises in other people's streams. Like, that's the only thing that people really thought to do with it yet. The, uh oh, you can play it in somebody's stream.
2407000	2415000	But I'm sure there's going to be other things before too long that Beam wants to do because they're more about, like, especially the interactive games.
2415000	2420000	They want to do more of that stuff too where it's like, it's not just dropping sounds, but you can actually control the game.
2421000	2425000	And like maybe for a thousand sparks you could drop an enemy into somebody playing Dark Souls on Beam.
2426000	2435000	So that is still kind of a wild card that's lurking. But that whole live stream thing is really like, I mean, even five years ago we were looking at the future of live streaming.
2436000	2442000	And I feel like in some ways it's only just beginning. Because this was all about the shift for the gamers to get into it.
2442000	2447000	But now you see the mainstream starting to get into it more and more too. It's going to be very interesting. Very interesting in the coming years.
2448000	2451000	Any other thoughts on Twitch before we get into our gaming weeks? Streaming and all? Alright.
2452000	2459000	Let's get into our gaming weeks. Every week we like to talk about the types of video games that we have been playing this week to set the stage for where our gamer brains are at.
2460000	2461000	Dark Soccer, how was your gaming week?
2461000	2465000	It's been mostly Breath of the Wild. Dan and I are doing kind of our co-playing thing.
2468000	2473000	Because I basically just spot a lot more things while he might be focused on something else.
2474000	2477000	So there's that. I've actually been playing a lot less WoW since we've been doing that.
2478000	2482000	But they finally put out the last LFR for the Nighthold.
2483000	2486000	So I did the Gul'dan raid and it's like, oh my god.
2487000	2495000	Dear Tanks, there's a site called WoWhead. And if you've never done the fucking raid before, study it.
2496000	2499000	There's also a channel that does raids in two minutes.
2500000	2502000	Maybe you should get on Discord and explain it to me.
2503000	2508000	Girl, no. I ended up having done the fight before, just never finished it.
2508000	2511000	Telling the Tank how to tank. And I don't tank.
2512000	2513000	Maybe you should tank.
2514000	2518000	No. I remember when I tried. For like a hot minute when I had Rebecca Black.
2519000	2522000	Who was permanently at level 85 and is now my bank alt.
2523000	2526000	But you only play her on Friday, Friday.
2530000	2533000	My heart weeps. Don't cry for me Argentina.
2533000	2536000	Now, you may have hurt Bobby's feelings in our chat.
2537000	2540000	Bobby Blackwolf says, the anti-tank rant is why I quit Final Fantasy XIV.
2541000	2543000	Because I was dumb and my first character was a tank.
2544000	2552000	No, no, no. There's a difference between people criticizing your tanking style and going into a fight fully ignorant.
2553000	2555000	Bobby would also listen to what anybody told him.
2556000	2557000	Like if we said, Bobby do this. He'd be like, okay.
2557000	2566000	Yeah. That's okay. If you take your feedback or if someone says, hey, try this instead. This mechanic's gonna happen. That's fine.
2567000	2573000	The guy we had would not do anything that people suggested. Had no idea.
2574000	2580000	And I'm like, finally I'm copying and pasting out of Wowhead. Tanks. This.
2581000	2582000	And then we finish the fight.
2583000	2585000	Congrats. GG. I'm beating it.
2586000	2587000	Thank you.
2588000	2589000	You're welcome.
2590000	2591000	But, oh my God. Oh my God.
2592000	2593000	Alright.
2594000	2597000	Oh yeah. And I'm still kind of on best of move in Pokemon Go.
2598000	2601000	Awesome. Let's go to Loki. How was your gaming week?
2602000	2608000	I didn't really play that much this week. I've been having to actually program. So that's what I've been doing.
2608000	2613000	But I did play a little bit of Skyrim and just the bare minimum of Pokemon Go.
2614000	2616000	And that's really it.
2617000	2618000	That's it?
2619000	2620000	Yeah.
2621000	2622000	Alright. How about you, JD? How was your gaming week?
2623000	2628000	Pretty good. I mean, the Switch is still new to me. So I've been playing a bit of Zelda. I've been playing some of the other games like Voice.
2629000	2634000	And I bought Snipperclips. And that was a lot of fun to play around with.
2635000	2640000	It's like two joy cons. And we only figured out the two player mode. But apparently it supports up to four.
2641000	2644000	And that was a lot of fun. It's a cooperative puzzle game.
2645000	2649000	I've also been playing with my 3DS a lot. I still take that back and forth to work with me.
2650000	2653000	So I've been doing Street Passes and Rhythm Heaven Megamix.
2655000	2660000	How do you enjoy, as a music game fan, how do you enjoy Voice? Do you think it's a good addition to the Switch?
2661000	2663000	Or do you think it's kind of a cash in or what?
2664000	2669000	I mean, I liked it. I've played a couple hours on it. Or maybe an hour or so. And it was alright.
2670000	2674000	I tried it on my phone first because it's free there and I wanted to see if I would like it.
2675000	2679000	And comparing my Android with the Switch, I was impressed by the size of the screen.
2680000	2684000	I'm like, this makes a touchscreen music game a lot easier because you have more room to maneuver around with.
2685000	2691000	I liked it. I don't know any of the songs. And for music games, that's often a bonus if you know stuff.
2691000	2696000	But I like the soundtrack well enough. The play style seems great.
2699000	2703000	We tried the first couple and it was really easy. And the difficulty definitely scales up.
2704000	2708000	Yeah, well you figure the easy level first few songs are going to certainly be easy.
2709000	2714000	And also you have the luxury of, you've played a lot of music games so a lot of it just kind of comes naturally to you.
2715000	2719000	Like, tap here when this happens. Okay, well I've played Elite Beat Agents before. I'm already a leg up, right?
2719000	2725000	Yeah. Cool. So you're enjoying the Nintendo Switch overall? You didn't own a Wii U, right?
2726000	2730000	I bought a Wii U in January because I'm like, if I'm going to get one at all, it needs to happen.
2731000	2733000	Oh, you wanted one before they were gone for good. Got it.
2734000	2736000	Because there are still Wii U exclusive games that I wanted to have.
2737000	2738000	For now.
2739000	2740000	Well, okay.
2741000	2743000	For all you know, Mario Maker will show up on 3DS. Well, Mario Maker's already on 3DS.
2744000	2747000	It did show up on 3DS, but on Switch and all that stuff before too long.
2747000	2754000	Yeah, but I mean, the Wii U I got also because there were a couple of Wii games I didn't find, so it made it really easy to buy those digitally as well.
2755000	2760000	But yeah, I didn't manage to get a pre-order for Switch, so I waited six hours at Best Buy.
2761000	2762000	Wow.
2763000	2764000	I mean, that's better than a lot of people had to wait, so.
2765000	2767000	And that was six hours in the Bay Area, which is where all the tech nerds are.
2768000	2773000	In San Francisco, and it was like, I don't know, like 40 degrees out or something. It was cold that weekend.
2774000	2776000	I had to get my husband to deliver me blankets and a burrito.
2777000	2779000	Important stuff to get through the weekend.
2780000	2781000	Yeah.
2782000	2783000	But, well, you got your Switch though and all as well.
2784000	2785000	Yeah.
2786000	2789000	Good, good. Alright, let's see, my gaming week. So, I've also been playing quite a bit of Nintendo Switch.
2790000	2792000	I mean, there's always still like, you know, the Final Fantasy XIV, the Overwatch as well.
2793000	2799000	But, I was playing a little bit of Zelda earlier on in the week, but then I actually kind of started to drift away from that for a little bit.
2800000	2804000	I mean, nothing's wrong with Zelda. It's still a great game, but it's just like, oh, this console plays other games too.
2804000	2810000	I started playing Shovel Knight. I said I was not going to buy Shovel Knight. I swore a banana wasn't going to buy Shovel Knight.
2811000	2817000	And then I was like, maybe I'll just buy it again. I'll get the Treasure Trove, because it has the Plague of Shadows and all the other stuff.
2818000	2826000	I'll just buy it again. So, I might own Shovel Knight on as many platforms as I own Mass Effect 3 on now. I might be at that point.
2827000	2830000	But at least Shovel Knight is awesome, just like Mass Effect 3. So, I was playing some of that.
2831000	2837000	And then on Friday, a game that I was really anticipating on the Switch came out, and that is Blaster Master Zero.
2838000	2844000	And I really tried to temper my expectations, because you might remember there was Blaster Master Overdrive, I think it was called on the Wii.
2845000	2852000	And it was okay. I didn't hate Blaster Master Overdrive, but it didn't really capture the magic of the original, and I think a lot of that was just like,
2853000	2858000	I think some of the physics was kind of reinvented, and so it felt a little clunkier than the original did.
2858000	2864000	Something felt off the whole time I played Overdrive, and it wasn't bad, but it was weird.
2865000	2872000	So, I was kind of expecting to go through something similar with Blaster Master Zero, but I have to confess, I really like Blaster Master Zero.
2873000	2879000	I like it a lot, and it really brings back a lot of the spirit of the original Blaster Master.
2880000	2884000	So, here's the thing, because people are wondering, is this a remake? Is this a sequel? What the hell are they doing here?
2884000	2893000	Here's the thing, Blaster Master Zero is to Blaster Master on the NES, what Metroid Zero was to Metroid on the NES.
2894000	2900000	So, it's like the first part of the game is pretty much the same, but then you start to get into other levels, and different things start happening.
2901000	2907000	There's more bosses, there's slight differences to the level, like Area 2, they completely changed the setup for it.
2908000	2913000	They make it a housing area or something like that, whereas in the NES version, it was like another swampy area or something.
2914000	2920000	They changed things very subtle like that, but I noticed you still kind of go through a very similar progression with items and so on.
2921000	2929000	So, yeah, that's kind of the best way I can describe it. If you have played Blaster Master on the NES, Blaster Master Zero is kind of like what they did with Metroid Zero.
2930000	2934000	However, some other things they've added, some huge quality of life improvements from the original.
2935000	2940000	You now have the ability to save your game, you have restart points, you don't have lives anymore.
2940000	2945000	You just have restart points that once you cross it, you can restart from that point, and you have maps.
2946000	2950000	You can use a map, and so it actually feels a lot more like Metroid, which the original kind of did.
2951000	2963000	Maybe the only thing I could say that actually is kind of surprising me about Blaster Master Zero so far that may get it some backlash or whatever is that it's pretty darn easy.
2963000	2975000	Like, it's really easy. Actually, I have not really had a struggle in anything until I hit the part of the game where it's like you have to time a jump just right to land on a ladder.
2976000	2982000	And that part of the game was actually really infuriating me because it's like, God, the rest of the game has been so fucking easy right up to this point.
2983000	2988000	But I think part of the reason why Blaster Master Zero is a lot easier is A, those two quality of life changes I just talked about,
2988000	2995000	and B, the fact that your gun is way easier to power up than it was in the original, and it does different stuff.
2996000	3003000	In the original, when you powered up your gun, it kind of changed the shape and things like that, and it was cool. You could get it really strong.
3004000	3013000	But in this one, as your gun powers up, you get a charge shot, an auto shot, a flame thrower, and then you get this super powerful wave beam that just cuts through walls.
3013000	3025000	And if you can hang on to that, it's really easy. Because in the original Blaster Master, every time you took damage, not only did your health go down by one, but your gun power went down by one.
3026000	3032000	In this one, that is still the case, but the gun power ups are handed out like candy, so it's really easy to get back up to eight.
3032000	3043000	And then you get an item really early on that's like a shell, like spoiler alert, but it's not a big deal, it's like a shell for your gun meter that basically you can get hit one time without losing any gun power.
3044000	3051000	And that shell regenerates after like 30 seconds. So it's like you're allowed to make one fuck up every 30 seconds so you don't lose gun power.
3052000	3061000	And so it really makes the game a lot easier than the original. But you know what? I'm not as good at video games as I was when I was nine when the original Blaster Master came out.
3062000	3071000	There's a part of me that actually kind of appreciates the scale down and difficulty. Now I don't know if maybe a harder mode is going to open up when I beat it or something. I'm not through the whole game yet. I'm up to area five.
3072000	3079000	But I'm not sure where that's all going to go. But yeah, I'm just really enjoying the game from a nostalgia standpoint.
3080000	3091000	And I think the thing that's important to note too is that it's only $10. Which for games nowadays, especially like launch titles on a new console, that's really pretty darn reasonable.
3092000	3098000	So that's great. Because that's how much virtual console games would cost almost in some cases. So I'm glad to hear about that.
3099000	3107000	TigerConChat asks, does the new Blaster Master game use the story about the boy and his frog? Because it wouldn't be Blaster Master if it wasn't about that.
3108000	3115000	Here's the thing about that. Yes it does. It does use that story. But it goes a little further with it. Here's the crazy part.
3116000	3124000	So do you guys remember, years ago, there used to be a bunch of books that were written on NES video games. It was the Worlds of Power books.
3125000	3133000	And they did one on like Castlevania, Simon's Quest, and there was Ninja Gaiden. And there was all these different games that they did the books on.
3134000	3143000	So they did a book for Blaster Master. Well, that book introduced a character into the universe called Eve. Eve is in the game.
3143000	3153000	So I don't think it's the first time she's appeared. I think she showed up in either the Wii one or the Game Boy one they did a long time ago.
3154000	3165000	So I don't think it's the first time Eve has shown up. But it's still neat to me that this character that was created in a book that was totally a side story that wasn't really part of canon, kind of became canon.
3165000	3175000	So I thought that was really cool that they did that. So Eve is now a character in the game. I'm not going to spoil much more than that, like why she's there or anything like that, but you will see that.
3176000	3178000	So I think that's kind of cool that the books inspired that.
3179000	3183000	So, Stoppy in chat says the book is canon. Yeah, I guess it is now.
3183000	3196000	And Dark Tetsuya points out, to be fair, that wasn't even in the Japanese original. That was all the US Division's idea. Yeah, the whole frog thing, the boy losing his frog, that was not in the Japanese original because they localized that like years later.
3197000	3203000	Yeah, Stoppy points out Eve was in the PS1 Blaster Master. That's what it was. But I just think it's funny that she shows up here too.
3204000	3209000	Anyhow, I really enjoyed Blaster Master Zero and I would recommend it. And Shovel Knight is a good game too.
3209000	3217000	Okay, but I will talk about one game that I didn't really care for. And I'm sorry, JD, because it's a game that you brought over, but you already know how I feel about this.
3218000	3229000	And that is, I did not enjoy that new Bomberman game at all. And that's probably because I don't really, like, I kind of think the Bomberman franchise is kind of overhyped.
3229000	3238000	Like, as far as classic games go. Like, everybody's got something, right? So, if you are thinking I'm crazy by saying that, then you're probably going to just feel different by nature about Bomberman Zero.
3239000	3246000	But, you know, Shane was really trying to tell me I should get Bomberman Zero. I want to get Bomberman Zero. We can play multiplayer. But I was like, no, I don't really care for Bomberman.
3247000	3254000	And I don't know what this game is going to do to make it any better. And it doesn't, like, the controls feel, like, JD, is it just me? The controls feel kind of sluggish in that game.
3254000	3257000	No, I think you're right. Like, I noticed, like, it felt a little weird.
3258000	3259000	Yeah, there is something patching that out, too.
3260000	3271000	Well, I don't think it's a delay thing, because I was noticing that, just, like, with a regular controller, also, it was, like, it just, something about, I mean, it feels kind of silly to say physics in a 2D top-down game, but it feels like the physics are off.
3272000	3275000	And the voice acting is super annoying.
3276000	3280000	Oh, it's hilarious. Like, especially as you play as Aqua and you start winning, and, yeah, no, it's funny.
3280000	3302000	Okay, so I was playing as the Black Bomberman, because this thing I saw on Twitter made him look hilarious. And as you are circling around the outside, because when, okay, that was one thing I thought was kind of a neat little change on the formula, was that when you get knocked out in Bomberman, you revive on the edge of the plat field, and you can fire bombs as a ghost into the, back into the field, and if you knock somebody else out, you take their place.
3303000	3304000	Yeah, Revenge has been around for a couple of...
3305000	3307000	Oh, has it? That shows you how often I've been playing these games.
3307000	3308000	Yeah.
3309000	3318000	So anyway, so, okay, so the Revenge thing is there, but every time you fire a bomb as the Black Bomberman, take that! Take that! Take that! And I'm like, shut up!
3319000	3323000	All of the characters give a line when they throw a bomb as Revenge, and that is kind of annoying.
3324000	3331000	Yeah, so I'm just, I'm not hearing, I'm not feeling the Bomberman game, but if you guys are enjoying it, good for you. Hooray.
3331000	3335000	But yeah, I'm glad I didn't spend the money on that, but there's other great Switch games to check out.
3336000	3342000	Zelda, Zelda, Zelda, Zelda, and, you know, Barman, or Bla, Barman, Blaster Master Zero I think is great,
3343000	3349000	and Shovel Knight, of course, if for some reason you've missed Shovel Knight until now, that's a great game too.
3350000	3353000	I still haven't had my hands on 1-2 Switch yet, I'll probably get there eventually.
3354000	3357000	And then what, next week we're going to have Binding of Isaac, a new version of that is out on the Wii U.
3357000	3365000	Get your systems together, Rob, on the Switch, so that'll be really exciting too. Cool!
3366000	3373000	Tigerclaw in chat says, Sky, maybe the character should have said bombs away, bombs away, bombs away.
3374000	3375000	I mean, there are eight characters.
3376000	3382000	One of them probably does. Anyhow, that's my gaming week. That's enough, I've gone on long enough.
3382000	3388000	So, housekeeping tonight, I don't have a lot, except I do want to promote for sure, Sac Indie Arcade is coming up,
3389000	3393000	it's coming up on April the 8th, we're going to be broadcasting all day from the West Sacramento Convention Center,
3394000	3398000	if you are in Northern California, I highly encourage you to make the drive and check it out.
3399000	3401000	Sac Indie Arcade is going to be a lot of fun, we'll be there live all day.
3402000	3406000	This time I'll go to all of the rooms instead of realizing there was an extra room they didn't go to at the very end.
3406000	3413000	Yes, and I'm hoping we might have extra help this year so that we don't have to be at the table 24-7 so that we can actually go play some more of the games.
3414000	3416000	That'll be very exciting, so that'll be cool.
3417000	3419000	Dan will be running the Atari Party table again too.
3420000	3423000	Oh, so Atari Party is making a cameo again, that's great. Atari Party was fun.
3424000	3427000	So, it's not just indie games, but kind of a celebration of other gaming too.
3428000	3432000	I will definitely make sure we get Gabe and Brie back on the show before that day if they are available,
3432000	3437000	so we can talk all about what to expect at this year's Indie Arcade, because I know they have all new speakers, it's going to be a good time.
3438000	3439000	So, look forward to that.
3440000	3442000	I do not know if we will end up having a show the next night.
3443000	3446000	Something has come up where Jamie and I may have other obligations the very next night,
3447000	3451000	and we figure if we are broadcasting all day long the day before, then perhaps we deserve a night off.
3452000	3457000	So, more to come on that as we approach April, that would be April 9th would be the show date for that,
3458000	3459000	we'll let you guys know as that gets closer.
3459000	3466000	Anyhow, in the meantime, let's get into some gaming news and what's going on in gaming this week. Loki.
3467000	3474000	Alright, so Nintendo talked a little bit about, hey, where the heck are those streaming services that are not on the Switch?
3475000	3482000	And, well, they said that Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon will be coming in some time.
3483000	3492000	And, you know, they basically said, you know, what they basically were saying is that their system is more of like about the games on the system.
3493000	3499000	And then, of course, they're talking to other companies about bringing those services, because they said that they're not differentiators.
3500000	3505000	What differentiates the Nintendo Switch is, you know, the games and how they're played.
3506000	3509000	That sounds like a cop-out to me, if you really got to ask.
3509000	3514000	I do think it's a bit of a cop-out, but it's one they can kind of get away with right now.
3515000	3520000	Like, you know, there's enough stuff on the Switch right now, especially with how freaking good Zelda is,
3521000	3523000	there's enough stuff on the Switch they can kind of get away with right now.
3524000	3530000	So, it's, you know, and I think it's a great line, the whole, like, we just want the system to be about games.
3531000	3537000	But I just can't believe that in their, you know, five-year plan for the system, their ten-year plan, however long they want the Switch to be viable,
3537000	3541000	I just don't believe that they wouldn't try to ever bring in some of this other stuff.
3542000	3545000	And again, I think it's just one of those things that will show up this holiday.
3546000	3550000	And then, suddenly, and the reason why I bring this up, because I'm sure some of you guys, I'm not even looking at chat at the moment,
3551000	3553000	I'm sure some of you guys are saying, yes, Rob, a gaming console should be about the games.
3554000	3562000	Look, my point I'm making is that that line that they're saying right now is going to do a 180 this holiday when they do launch Netflix and that stuff.
3562000	3570000	That's my point, is that it's just a convenient line right now for what they have available, but come holiday when they do have the rest of that stuff,
3571000	3578000	they're going to say, well, not only did we want to be the best gaming system with the best games like Zelda and Splatoon 2, we wanted to bring you even more!
3579000	3580000	And that's the thing, I'm calling it right now.
3581000	3588000	It's not a differentiator. It actually is a differentiator, because you're launching with an online service that's not as robust as your competition. Period.
3588000	3595000	That's how it is. And yes, your system is different in the way it plays games. That is also a differentiator.
3596000	3603000	But you can't dismiss that this is not a differentiator, especially when, as you said, a few months from now, they're just going to fucking flip that line anyways.
3604000	3608000	It is. Just accept it, say yes, it'll come in time. That's it.
3609000	3610000	Which is essentially what he said.
3611000	3614000	Right. Pretty much. With the differentiator part added in there.
3614000	3618000	Stoppy in chat says, you don't think there's enough on the Switch? Wait till it gets hacked.
3619000	3630000	Look, here's the thing. It's not that I don't necessarily think there's enough on the Switch at this point, you know, especially, I mean, that was a pretty, for one week after launch, that was a pretty good week the Switch had last week.
3631000	3636000	I really enjoy Blaster Master Zero. JD says voice is worth it if you're a music game fan.
3637000	3643000	You had the Neo Geo games, which I'm surprised Dark Sakura hasn't kind of poked her head in, what's this? But you probably have the original Neo Geo games.
3644000	3649000	But that's available now on the Switch. What is it? World Heroes Champions is one of them. One of the Metal Slug games.
3650000	3651000	World Heroes is...
3652000	3653000	There's four or five games.
3654000	3662000	All these indies and old titles can, you know, keep the Switch going, but it's going to take third party support aside from indies.
3663000	3670000	And that's what the major consoles have right now, except for the Switch. Doesn't it really have a lot of stuff coming out third party wise right now?
3670000	3680000	But here's my point. Here's my point. The week that the Switch just had this last week, the Wii U did not have a week like that one week after launch.
3681000	3692000	The Wii didn't have a week like that one week after launch. So if this is the trend for Nintendo is going to be pumping out like a pretty big, even if third party, indie, whatever it is,
3692000	3705000	if the Switch is able to pump out like a title at least worth turning your head at, and Nintendo's did a pretty good job with that news thing that it does seem to update in your sleep and it doesn't connect to the internet.
3706000	3716000	So it kind of lets you know right when you turn on the system, hey, this game is available. Nintendo may not have that whole problem with, oh gosh, there's no games available on it that they had with the Wii U.
3717000	3728000	But the Wii U launched with a ton of titles. I bought a lot of those titles. So that's not really an argument. They launched with way more titles than the Switch. I don't remember what the Wii U had, but I know the Wii U had...
3729000	3732000	There was a bunch of crap that was on PS3 and Xbox already, except now it was the touchscreen.
3733000	3740000	This is true. They did have a lot of things like that, but that's what they're doing now with the Switch. It's stuff that was on the Wii U, but now it's on the Switch.
3741000	3748000	So it's the same thing, except now they just aren't releasing them right at day one. Instead they're saying, hey, look, it's coming out in April.
3749000	3765000	I literally watched their trailer for the whole Mario Kart 8 on the Switch, because it's a fucking Wii U title, and showing what the features are and the new differentiators as I use his line.
3765000	3778000	It's nothing. It's literally two characters and, oh shit, we put Battle Mode back in there because it fucking should have been in the first place. And now you get two items. Big fucking deal.
3779000	3788000	See, that's Loki's opinion, but I'm looking in chat over at live.voggenetware.com. A10 in chat is asking, are you going to get Mario Kart 8, Rob? Yes. I will rebuy it.
3789000	3792000	I'm hoping they don't try to pull the $60 price tag on it.
3792000	3801000	Oh, you bet your ass. You bet your ass that shit's gonna be fucking $60. We'll see. I'm betting all the DLC characters in that purchase.
3802000	3812000	I'm pretty sure they are, but it doesn't matter. I already bought it on Wii U. But I will rebuy it on the Switch to have it portable and to be able to play, because you'll get Mario Kart 8 as well, right, JD?
3813000	3820000	Yeah, I didn't actually get Mario Kart 8 for Wii U, because I just bought it recently, and I was like, well, I'll just wait until it comes out on the Switch, and the same with Splatoon.
3820000	3824000	But then when you come over and play Mario Kart 8, we'll both be able to play on our Switch. It'll be awesome.
3825000	3841000	The other thing I have to admit was kind of neat about the Switch. Since JD did bring his system over, it was so easy and fucking convenient to want to play Bomberman, all we had to do was take my Switch out of the dock, put JD's in, Bomberman time. It was that easy.
3842000	3845000	So, I mean, actually, no, not with Bomberman, we just moved the cart.
3846000	3849000	Bomberman was a cartridge, so we just switched the game out for Snipperclips.
3850000	3851000	That was at Snipperclips.
3852000	3853000	Which is DLC only.
3854000	3863000	But still, that made it awfully convenient to show off another game or what have you. This is something that isn't as easy on PlayStation 4 or Xbox One, if you don't have it on disc.
3864000	3867000	And pairing the Joy-Cons was also really easy. All you have to do is just attach them to the console.
3867000	3878000	Yeah, for sure. Let's see, so, TigerClaw in chat says, is the new Mario Kart 8 going to have all the DLC from the Wii U version, and I mean stuff like playing as Link and some other Nintendo characters outside of Mario.
3879000	3884000	Yes, and I think it's going to have more, too, because it's going to have the Splatoon Kids and King Boo.
3885000	3887000	Well, the Splatoon Kids were in there already, I thought.
3888000	3889000	No, not the Splatoon Kids. They weren't there.
3890000	3895000	No, Animal Crossing was there, and I haven't even seen them, but I'm sure they're in this one.
3896000	3898000	Animal Crossing and Zelda were the big DLC packs.
3899000	3900000	I thought that they were in there.
3901000	3902000	Nope, they're new.
3903000	3904000	Oh, who gives a shit?
3905000	3914000	Well, I'm not that big on the characters, but again, it's more about the fact that now I'll have it portable, and the battle mode stuff will be neat, so I'm very excited about it.
3914000	3920000	So, there we go. Let's see, going to chat over at live.fognetwork.com.
3921000	3923000	BbBlackWolf says, I give a shit. LOL.
3926000	3930000	Let's see, ActDeft also says, I'm one of those that give a shit. So, low-key, some folks give a shit.
3931000	3935000	And you know who else gives a shit? People that buy fucking Apple products year after year after release.
3936000	3940000	It's fine, if you want to buy the same product over and over again, then more power to you. I'm just not going to do it.
3940000	3944000	That's why everybody gets to have an opinion, I suppose.
3945000	3946000	Even if they're wrong.
3947000	3958000	Alright. Well, here's the thing, low-key, interesting sales news about this, but it is coming from Nintendo, so I suppose you could take a skeptic's angle to this.
3959000	3971000	However, in an interview that was in the New York Times with NOA President Reggie Fils-Aime, he mentioned that the Switch in America and Canada has outsold the Wii in a two-day period.
3972000	3979000	This means the Switch has surpassed 600,000 in sales if you break the numbers down in that same region.
3979000	3989000	So that could mean that if you consider worldwide, because Japan sold another 313,000, they probably sold a million at least in that first week, which certainly is outpacing Wii U.
3990000	3996000	Now, I'm going to say it before you can, because I totally understand the skeptic's angle to this.
3997000	4000000	It's much easier to sell them when you made enough to put them on the fucking shelves.
4001000	4012000	Exactly. Because they would have sold a ton more. I guarantee if they had an infinite amount of product available, they would have sold more of the Wii than they would have the Switch.
4013000	4017000	J.D., when you were at that Best Buy, were there people that got turned away who couldn't buy a Switch because they ran out?
4018000	4029000	I didn't stay long enough to find out. My Best Buy had two lines, so the people who were in the no pre-order line, they let some of them in, and then some of the pre-order people, and just alternated.
4030000	4032000	So I left it at 1230, and I was fine.
4033000	4034000	Gotcha. I figured there might be some people who left it there.
4035000	4041000	And how nice of them to be able to see them, Nintendo, being the ones that actually control that shit as far as how much product is available.
4042000	4045000	How nice to say that, oh, look at the Switch is doing so much better than the Wii.
4046000	4051000	Okay, I get that, but that skepticism aside, at least there is a positive I see with this.
4052000	4056000	Is that the Wii U didn't have a supply problem.
4057000	4058000	Oh no, it did have a fucking supply problem.
4058000	4064000	I was able to find one that morning that it launched without waiting in line, I just casually went into Target and picked one up.
4065000	4072000	I mean, I think after maybe that initial period, then yeah, there was a supply problem, but you didn't see it fly off the fucking shelf like the Wii did.
4073000	4075000	Oh yeah, no one's gonna argue that the Wii U was a strong platform at all.
4076000	4086000	But then I would say that is good news for Nintendo, because they have to do better than they did with Wii U, and it looks like the Switch is doing better than Wii U.
4086000	4089000	Well, just saying.
4090000	4092000	I mean, that's such a low bar to explain.
4093000	4096000	Well yes, it was a low bar, but Nintendo had to overcome it.
4097000	4098000	Good job.
4099000	4100000	How does it compare with the original Wii, though?
4101000	4104000	Because I know the original Wii was selling really well, because of Wii Sports and all that.
4105000	4110000	It did, but not until it was already out for a year, because nobody could fucking buy one when it was first out.
4110000	4118000	Yeah, and they're not gonna fucking play that angle. They're not gonna say, well, our fucking distribution line was fucked up like crazy, and now it's just less fucked up.
4119000	4125000	Okay, I'm gonna really try to think back. Dark Soccer, think back with me. You gotta go back in your brain ten years. You ready?
4126000	4132000	Remember when y'all went to that Target, and Xtifer was there, and you were there, and Maggie and Chris went too, right?
4133000	4135000	It was just, actually it was me and Kristen.
4136000	4137000	I thought Xtifer was with you.
4137000	4139000	I thought Xtifer was with you, or did he go to a different store?
4140000	4141000	He went to a different store, I think.
4142000	4143000	Okay.
4144000	4145000	Because we went to the Target in Citrus Heights.
4146000	4147000	Maybe he went somewhere else. All right, but all that stuff aside.
4148000	4149000	We bribed our way in line.
4150000	4155000	How many Wiis were sold? Like 14 or something, right?
4156000	4159000	Something like that? No, there were more, because everyone who was in line got one.
4160000	4161000	But it wasn't that...
4162000	4163000	It was like 20.
4163000	4167000	JD, were there more than 20 people in the pre-order line to get a Switch?
4168000	4172000	I was like 20th in line, and I got there at 6pm. There were definitely lots more people than that in line.
4173000	4177000	So the point is, they had 20 Wiis on day one, and way more Switches on day one.
4178000	4184000	Yeah, they were giving out tickets, and they were continuing on around the corner of the building where I was, so they definitely had more stock.
4185000	4189000	Now granted, I am comparing Target in Sacramento to Best Buy in the heart of the Bay Area.
4189000	4192000	However, I would wage your money. This is still a safe comparison.
4193000	4195000	I mean, it's only one of two Best Buys in the city, so...
4196000	4200000	Yeah, so there's just plenty more availability of the Switch.
4201000	4210000	Okay, then perfect. And I hope that they do have that availability going forward, because they're not going to have any excuses then if it still doesn't outperform the Wii.
4211000	4213000	Then they're going to have no excuses.
4213000	4218000	Holiday is going to be fascinating. Holiday is going to be very, very fascinating for the Switch.
4219000	4228000	Because it will be fascinating to see if the Switch still has that same momentum, like that must-have system going into Holiday, and what Nintendo's going to do to it to really kick it in the ass.
4229000	4233000	It's going to be more than a Mario game, and I think this is what they're saving the Netflix angle for.
4234000	4242000	I'm telling you, this is what Switch is going to do. It's going to have Netflix, but you're going to be able to watch Netflix on the TV, and then thanks to downloading Netflix, you can pick up...
4243000	4250000	It's not a differentiator. It really doesn't matter. It doesn't matter at all that it doesn't have Netflix or has Netflix, because it's not a differentiator.
4251000	4260000	Alright, anyway. Moving on, the Switch is selling, but how well it's selling, I suppose, is open to how you want to read into that.
4261000	4266000	We'll hopefully see some harder numbers in about a month's time, especially when Nintendo's financial year ends.
4266000	4275000	Meanwhile, though, we're going to go on to a different topic. I know Nintendo's really been dominating the conversation the past few weeks. It is a new system after all, but other gaming news going on as well, right, DarkSakura?
4276000	4277000	Kind of weird. Weird news.
4278000	4279000	How so?
4280000	4289000	Well, basically, two unlikely game developers are getting in bed and making sweet, sweet music game love.
4290000	4291000	Oh my god, yes.
4292000	4293000	Except not in the way that you think it is.
4293000	4301000	So it's Hasbro and Harmonix. And they are putting together a music card game.
4302000	4312000	So, and I had to bring this one up because, you know, we started off as a music game show and we, you know, had our long line with harmonix through the life of the show.
4313000	4314000	Of course.
4315000	4326000	Doing a card game called DropMix. It was basically you play different cards that have the bass, the beat loops or vocals of a song on a DropMix board.
4327000	4335000	And when the card is played, the corresponding piece of music goes on with a phone, be it iOS or Android, that's connected to the board.
4335000	4340000	So as multiple cards are placed, the app starts merging them into a track.
4341000	4353000	And basically it's using the NFC to be read by the board. And it's got actually a pretty decent list of songs. I mean, just different.
4354000	4357000	It's got like Earth, Wind and Fire, September. It has the final countdown.
4360000	4362000	I wonder who's going to build a sequence. It's just nothing but that.
4362000	4364000	We've got Run DMC, It's Tricky.
4365000	4366000	Oh wow.
4366000	4371000	Some friends for Nan Afrijack, Bruno Mars, Young MC. So Busta Move is in there.
4372000	4373000	That'll be fun.
4373000	4377000	Weezer's King of the World, A Tribe Called Quest Scenario, some Skrillex, whatever.
4379000	4381000	Can you mix, can you mix the songs together?
4382000	4383000	It's got churches in it.
4384000	4385000	Interesting.
4385000	4386000	That makes me happy.
4386000	4387000	Can you, can you mix the songs together?
4387000	4389000	It doesn't say anything about it, but it's going to go for a hundred.
4390000	4391000	Uh huh.
4391000	4400000	It's available in September and it will have a 16 and no, it has an additional 16. And okay, let me start over.
4401000	4410000	It comes with 60 cards in the game board. It comes with an additional 16 and five card packs will be released for 15 and $5 respectively.
4411000	4414000	And new cards coming out through 2017.
4414000	4421000	I love that we've still got DLC in a harmonics music game, even though, you know, the card games have done this for years.
4422000	4424000	So it's funny to me. This is their version of DLC.
4425000	4428000	Yeah, it's more like BC, Buyable Content.
4429000	4431000	Well as long as you're only buying the songs you want, it's not so bad.
4432000	4433000	Unless they're mixed up.
4434000	4437000	Well with card games, this is the fucking norm. Like take any card game, this is the norm.
4438000	4439000	Who in this room played Magic?
4440000	4441000	Cards Against Humanity. Hello?
4442000	4443000	No, no, Magic's even worse than that.
4444000	4447000	But anyway, who in this room still plays Magic?
4448000	4449000	Rageinator, raise your hand.
4450000	4451000	It got way too expensive.
4452000	4453000	I'm sorry?
4454000	4455000	I played the Pokemon trading card game a little.
4456000	4458000	Keep in mind, I've sold two full collections of Magic cards.
4459000	4464000	I was going to say, I sold my Magic the Gathering trading card deck my junior year of high school. That's how long that fucking game's been around.
4465000	4466000	I played all the way through my first round of college.
4467000	4468000	But it's a fun game. No disrespect.
4469000	4478000	But I wanted to say about this, I love the concept of how they're utilizing smartphones as a game controller.
4479000	4486000	Very similar, like Jackbox Party Pack kind of rethought that whole thing to how to do a party game with a bunch of cell phone controllers.
4487000	4488000	It's kind of like Harmonix has done that in a different way though.
4489000	4495000	They're using it now with an analog game, I suppose, or a more traditional board game, the smartphone controllers,
4495000	4497000	as opposed to a video game like what we saw at Jackbox.
4498000	4499000	It's the marriage of genre right there.
4500000	4505000	I just had a thought. What is Jackbox going to do with the Joy-Cons on the Switch? Because that would be amazing.
4506000	4512000	I don't know, but if I remember right, the whole trilogy, the Jackbox trilogy, I think shows up on that.
4513000	4516000	Indie games coming for Switch, so they're doing something.
4516000	4525000	Yeah, I don't know. We'll have to email our friends over there and see if they want to come on to talk about the Switch version when it releases.
4526000	4532000	And why we're going to buy their game again, just like I buy fucking Shovel Knight and Mass Effect 3 and all this other stuff.
4533000	4538000	Kaijuto in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says, we have the living card game now, Rob.
4539000	4543000	The trading card game is getting phased out, so not every card game has that now.
4543000	4546000	I thought deck building games were all the rage right now.
4547000	4548000	Ascension and Dominion.
4549000	4551000	Ascension, Dominion, and I played one that was all DC comic.
4552000	4556000	Oh yeah, there's the DC deck building game, which is the actual name of it. There's also a Marvel one called Legendary.
4557000	4562000	What's the one where it's like a PvE type of card game, where you're fighting a boss sentries of the...
4563000	4564000	Sentinels of the Multiverse?
4565000	4569000	Sentinels of the Multiverse, that's it. I thought deck building was the huge thing right now in card gaming.
4569000	4571000	Yeah. I mean, it is one of the...
4572000	4576000	It's fun! I love the concept of a PvE card game as opposed to a PvP card game.
4577000	4583000	I mean, the concept is like you're playing a comic book thing out and you choose your character based on which deck you pick out.
4584000	4585000	Yeah.
4586000	4587000	I mean, it's very comics-flavored. It's a lot of fun.
4588000	4591000	Alright, let's move on. Boy, our first part of the show is going along tonight, but that's okay.
4592000	4597000	It always seems like the slower news weeks, which, yes, I know PAX happened this weekend. We're on the wrong coast.
4597000	4602000	It seems like it was kind of a slower news week this week because everybody's too busy playing fucking Zelda, which I understand.
4603000	4607000	But it's the slow news weeks. They always have longer shows. Go figure. Loki.
4608000	4611000	So, Share Factory is getting quite the update on PlayStation 4.
4612000	4616000	So, the biggest part about it is you can actually import your own clips now.
4617000	4622000	Or external clips, I should say, using like a USB flash drive so you can put your own photos, your own video clips.
4622000	4631000	Along with that, they've also added over 30 textures that you can use to personalize text in the game.
4632000	4643000	They also have a new infomercial theme. There's a new photo mode collage thing, new stickers, and then, of course, updates to the overall UI.
4644000	4650000	I might have read this wrong, but didn't I hear that you can put GIFs in now? Like, you can load GIFs into your videos?
4650000	4660000	Maybe. Because if so, like, it's over. Like, I'm going to go to town with GIFs because my favorite thing is on Twitter and Share Factory.
4661000	4667000	Which, you know, when that first came out, I was playing around a lot with Share Factory. I think I still have something up on my YouTube channel.
4668000	4672000	Like, I compiled all these Final Fantasy XIV things into something in Share Factory.
4672000	4678000	You know, it's a pretty powerful little tool that I think is really underutilized. Probably because it takes a little time to learn.
4679000	4685000	But I'd be very curious how these new features kind of might make it better. And now the fact that you can kind of mix in your own stuff, too, would be really cool.
4686000	4690000	I have to say, one advantage of Slack over IRC is that you can do GIFs so much easier.
4691000	4696000	That is true. That is true. William Ritterface in chat says, can you import your own snipper clips, though?
4696000	4705000	Well, if you can import your own video, yes, you could. You would capture the footage of snipper clips on your PC or whatever, holding a phone up to the screen if you have to.
4706000	4713000	And then you could import that into your PlayStation video. So maybe I want to make a video in Share Factory that's nothing but my favorite Forza Horizon clips.
4714000	4717000	That's funny. Alright, anyway.
4717000	4726000	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, corn.
4727000	4733000	Moving on. Nintendo making money this week, but no, not from the Switch. Something else.
4734000	4739000	And honestly, even though they're making money in theory, they probably won't see any of this money for a good long time.
4739000	4750000	Here's the deal. It's $12.76 million Canadian dollars. Sorry, it's Canadian dollars because a Canadian federal court ruled in the favor of Nintendo America.
4751000	4764000	This was Nintendo America taking GoCyber Shopping Limited and the owner, Jeremy King, to court this week because this company was distributing circumvention devices, flash carts, mod chips, game copiers, all the things that Loki loves.
4764000	4770000	Sky 3DS, Gateway 3DS, and all those similar devices the court ruled is illegal.
4771000	4777000	And so he was found, I guess, guilty of being a distributor of all these game copy devices and so on.
4778000	4784000	And so I guess at one point he used to kind of boast about what he did, or at least that's what I'm reading about in these stories.
4785000	4791000	I don't have an example of that though. But now he's going to have to apologize on his website for the damage that he caused Nintendo.
4791000	4799000	Nintendo in a statement saying, Nintendo continues to be a leader in bringing innovative gaming platforms and software to our fans and millions of gamers across the globe.
4800000	4806000	Blah, blah, blah, track record, blah, blah, blah. We will vigorously enforce our intellectual property rights against those that attempt to steal or misuse them.
4807000	4808000	Yeah, like making YouTube videos of them.
4809000	4817000	Yeah, but no $12.6 million judgment in a YouTube case. Although I'm not going to argue Nintendo and some of their YouTube rules are pretty shitty.
4817000	4827000	But there's a big difference between Zelda music in a YouTube video and flash carts, game copiers, mod chips with the intent to copy software.
4828000	4832000	Not to Nintendo. That's the problem. There's no difference to that.
4833000	4837000	So do you think they're going to take me to court because I did a video on Legend of Zelda 8-bit on YouTube?
4838000	4839000	They'll monetize it.
4839000	4848000	I'm sure, I think they already did. No, I demonetized the video because I'm like, if I can't make money, neither can you. Ha ha ha ha ha. That's what I did.
4849000	4852000	But if you were making money, they would, they still may put ads on it.
4853000	4858000	Please. I'm not going to make, I'm not going to make money on YouTube. Let's be real. Let's start there.
4859000	4866000	Stopian Chat over at live.vognetwork.com says, that is so Canadian. His sentence is to apologize.
4869000	4872000	Come on. Anyway, let's see.
4873000	4879000	Dark Tetsuya Chat says, reminds me of when they nailed the guy behind the 76,001 Nintendo 64 Famiclone system.
4880000	4882000	There was a huge magazine ad about it when he got in trouble.
4883000	4889000	And aren't, people are reselling those mini NES classics with a bunch of games loaded into them, right?
4890000	4891000	So they're just asking for too much.
4892000	4893000	Who's selling them because I haven't found any in the stores.
4894000	4897000	Speaking of supply issues and fuckery in Nintendo.
4899000	4900000	Can't even get that system out.
4901000	4903000	Alright, anyhow, moving on. Just a few more stories before we get to the classic game of the week.
4904000	4905000	But first, our Sakura.
4906000	4907000	Mass Effect. Of course.
4908000	4909000	Ermagerd, it's almost here.
4910000	4911000	I know, right?
4912000	4913000	Have you watched any of the stuff that's come out of PAX?
4914000	4915000	Tried not to.
4916000	4917000	Are you trying to keep yourself spoiler free?
4918000	4919000	Yeah, except for the important things like character customization.
4920000	4921000	Yeah.
4922000	4923000	Because that's all I care about.
4924000	4925000	Of course.
4926000	4927000	And hey, can you fuck that? There's that too.
4927000	4936000	One of the things that got let out under Twitter is that you can pick which of the twins that you start with.
4937000	4939000	But then you can change your mind while doing customization.
4940000	4944000	So in effect, that means you can customize each of the rider twins.
4945000	4948000	And looks like a bunch of customization will go in.
4948000	4957000	So there also will be a lot more in the way of decision making that's going to affect the outcome in that.
4958000	4964000	But they said that the Mass Effect Andromeda character selection and character creation will be a lot like Fallout 4's.
4965000	4969000	Where you have them switch back and forth while they, you know, you can customize each character.
4970000	4976000	And then once you are in that position, then you can no longer customize it.
4976000	4980000	Although I know the community, there's going to be mod tools out before too long.
4981000	4983000	So that's cool stuff.
4984000	4990000	Yeah, I like the fact that the whole like the parent or the dad I guess kind of looks like how you customize the twins.
4991000	4992000	It's kind of interesting.
4993000	4995000	Well, they kind of did the same thing in Dragon Age 2, remember?
4996000	5003000	Where whichever of the siblings that you had, their appearance was based on what you chose for your hawk.
5003000	5010000	So to probably a much lesser extent since I doubt that it was as sophisticated as what Andromeda.
5011000	5012000	Frostbite is going to help.
5013000	5021000	But it'll be fun. And given what I've played in Frostbite games already, having played Dragon Age Inquisition, I'm looking forward to the level of customization.
5022000	5031000	I mean if someone can make What's His Face from the Wild Thornberries in Dragon Age or Nicolas Cage in Dragon Age because he's in everything ever.
5032000	5035000	They can do that for Mass Effect.
5036000	5039000	I'm very excited from what I'm hearing on Mass Effect multiplayer.
5040000	5043000	It sounds like it's going to be faster paced than Mass Effect 3, which is already pretty fast paced.
5044000	5048000	But that they're not really changing the core. It sounds like it's still going to be very similar. The core elements the same.
5048000	5055000	But the nice thing is you're not going to be required to play it at all. They're not doing that galactic readiness thing they did in Mass Effect 3 or any of that.
5056000	5062000	So you won't be required to play it to get the good ending. I think it's something about you can send out strike teams to do things.
5063000	5069000	And either you just send them out and they do it, or you are a part of that strike team in the multiplayer.
5070000	5071000	Like that's how it works.
5072000	5073000	In Inquisition?
5074000	5075000	Oh yeah, it was like the same thing in Inquisition, yeah.
5075000	5080000	Yeah, you'd have your table missions and then it would unlock certain parts of the map for you.
5081000	5085000	And as you walked through Skyhold, you did run into the multiplayer characters.
5086000	5087000	Yeah, I bet it's a similar thing.
5088000	5090000	You couldn't talk to them, but they were hanging out there. Except Isabella, dammit.
5091000	5093000	I was tickled when they put Isabella in multiplayer.
5094000	5099000	So maybe, I don't know, maybe magically Blasto will show up.
5099000	5100000	Blasto will show up.
5101000	5106000	What are the characters that we know and love or will love in the new Mass Effect game will show up.
5107000	5111000	But not a lot of plot spoilers leaking out still, which good. That's the stuff we don't want to be spoiled on.
5112000	5113000	That's the stuff that Dark Soccer doesn't want to hear about.
5114000	5118000	But people are going to start playing it, what, Thursday, right? Is when EA Access or whatever that thing is.
5119000	5123000	Origin is going to get that 10 hour preview or whatever of Mass Effect.
5124000	5127000	So look out because spoilers are incoming on Thursday.
5127000	5130000	That's why I'm getting the heck out of town this weekend.
5131000	5134000	Alright, moving on. Loki.
5135000	5143000	Alright, so Bethesda has kind of talked about what the actual free to play model for Quake Champions is going to be.
5144000	5151000	So basically you start off with the Ranger and that's kind of your free character in the game.
5151000	5159000	If you feel like you want to try a different character, you can buy access to each of the characters for some sort of price.
5160000	5167000	And then, yeah, so you get one free but you have to buy the rest.
5170000	5176000	You get only one free. Did you say it's rotating or you just get to pick one and that's the one you get?
5177000	5185000	Yeah, well you get one. So here's the other thing though. You can also, if you don't want to pay for the actual players like the other characters,
5186000	5190000	you can also earn that money with in-game currency called favor.
5191000	5196000	And that will also unlock the characters for a set period of time.
5197000	5202000	So you can also buy backpacks and brooms and whatever.
5203000	5208000	So basically it just sounds like a free to play model for a game. Not that surprising.
5209000	5214000	I'll still check it out. I like Quake games and so if it's free to play, why not? Just check it out at least.
5215000	5221000	And the other thing, they showed off a little bit of one of the new champions that they have.
5221000	5234000	So they have Nyx who, let's see, I guess she's pretty agile and she has an ability called Ghost Walk that allows her to move between dimensions.
5235000	5238000	So while she does that, she's invisible and immune to damage.
5239000	5241000	So she's Sombra.
5242000	5243000	Yeah.
5244000	5246000	Since I think we all know what game may have inspired Quake Champions.
5246000	5249000	You don't say. The Game of Money? Is that what it is?
5250000	5251000	Yes.
5252000	5257000	Alright. Well also, a game that's no stranger to making money, Parappa the Rappa. That's right.
5258000	5262000	Parappa the Rappa. Remember they're re-releasing it again, but it's the remastered version for the...
5263000	5266000	How can you remaster that? I mean it's pretty basic looking as it is.
5267000	5268000	Yeah, but they were very pixely.
5269000	5273000	Well, and it's widescreen supported now. Remember the original was PlayStation 1 so it was a 3-4 ratio.
5274000	5275000	That's kind of a stretch.
5276000	5279000	Yes, that's what they're doing. They're stretching the image out to fill an HDTV.
5280000	5288000	So, Parappa the Rappa, you guys already forgot. They released Stage 1 during the PlayStation experience, I think it was, a couple months ago.
5289000	5290000	So I think folks forgot this is coming.
5291000	5292000	Yeah, they did. Surprise!
5293000	5300000	Well, it's been dated and dollared. It's going to come out March 8th for us in North America, which means it's out, I guess.
5301000	5303000	Did Parappa the Rappa remaster come out and I've missed it?
5303000	5306000	I think so. March 8th, I guess, I totally missed.
5307000	5311000	Oh, wow. I've been too busy with the fucking Switch to notice that this came out.
5312000	5316000	This might not have been the best time to release Parappa the Rappa stealthily on the PlayStation 4.
5317000	5319000	But it is $20 is what it's going to cost you there.
5320000	5324000	So, April 4th in Europe for $11.99, local currency.
5325000	5329000	And in Japan, April 20th, you get that on $420 for 1,800 yen.
5329000	5332000	So, there it is. ActDeftInChat says, you gotta believe that it's already released.
5333000	5339000	Yeah, I haven't really checked on what released on the PlayStation 4 store this week because I've been distracted with Zelda.
5340000	5341000	They should have released it the week before the Switch came out.
5342000	5350000	Yeah, or something. Also, one reason why Japan has to wait a little longer for it, there's actually going to be a physical release of this in Japan.
5351000	5355000	So, you can actually get a Japanese copy of the game with the box art, which looks really cute.
5355000	5361000	You can check that out. That will come out with the game on April 20th.
5362000	5369000	Also, don't forget, LocoRoco remastered and Patapon remastered are also scheduled for the PlayStation 4 at some point this year after this.
5370000	5371000	So, exciting stuff.
5372000	5374000	Alright, well, we're going to take a trip down memory lane.
5377000	5382000	And every week, DarkSakura steps into the gaming vault and finds a game that she thinks ought to be remastered.
5382000	5386000	But once in a while in 2017, she brings out the whole damn system.
5387000	5388000	Yep.
5389000	5391000	DarkSakura, what is the classic console of the month of March?
5392000	5394000	Of March. The WonderSwan.
5395000	5399000	And I think that at least two people in this room own some kind of WonderSwan.
5400000	5404000	I do. A very generous listener of the show. I don't know if he listens anymore, but actually, um, Ram-
5405000	5406000	He's got a WonderSwan crystal, right?
5407000	5411000	Yeah, Ram like a gaming company thing that resold this stuff and got me one, so that was really nice.
5412000	5416000	I have a WonderSwan color. I actually have the Final Fantasy I and II WonderSwan color.
5417000	5423000	So, but let's go back into the original WonderSwan, which actually, your ex-roommate had a WonderSwan color.
5424000	5425000	No, a regular WonderSwan.
5426000	5429000	And that's where I played Beatmania on WonderSwan, which is now background music for us.
5430000	5434000	It was the best home version of Beatmania as well. All the music was perfect.
5435000	5439000	So anyway, the WonderSwan was a handheld game console that was released by Bandai.
5439000	5445000	It was actually developed by Gunpei Yokoi's company, Koto Laboratory, with Bandai.
5446000	5451000	So, um, it came out in 1999 amongst the fifth generation of consoles.
5452000	5457000	And then there were two later versions, as I just mentioned, the WonderSwan color and the Swan crystal.
5458000	5466000	All of them being supported until 2003, so there were no releases of this outside of Japan.
5466000	5478000	It was a 16-bit system, but it actually had a really, really long battery life in comparison to the Game Boy Color at the time and the Neo Geo Pocket Color.
5479000	5480000	Those were its contemporaries.
5481000	5482000	And it had a lower price point.
5483000	5486000	Honestly enough, I think the games looked a bajillion times better on it, too.
5487000	5494000	It had different upgrades to it, you know, like I said, that add color and it had great audio.
5494000	5496000	I mean, just listen to this for a second.
5497000	5499000	Yes, I will. This is a sample from Beatmania.
5508000	5509000	Here we go.
5513000	5514000	Remember that thing?
5515000	5516000	Yeah, the cat song.
5517000	5518000	But doesn't that sound perfect?
5519000	5520000	Yes, it sounds purrrfect.
5521000	5523000	But this is on a handheld.
5524000	5528000	Keep in mind, the Game Boy Color one at the time was shit. Sorry, it was shit.
5529000	5532000	Comparing the Beatmania GB to this is like night and day.
5533000	5548000	Yeah, so the awesome thing about the WonderSwan is that you can play it horizontally or vertically, which the Klonoa game, which I've got for WonderSwan, it uses both orientations for some of the levels.
5549000	5550000	So it's really cool.
5551000	5557000	It had a lot of good third party support, mostly from Square, Namco, and Taito.
5558000	5569000	They sold something like, for all of its iterations, something like 3.5 million units in Japan and had 8% of the Japanese handheld market at the time before the Game Boy Advance came out.
5570000	5572000	Ooh, this is the other video of some of that third party stuff, huh?
5573000	5574000	Yeah.
5581000	5583000	Maybe not the most riveting music of the game.
5584000	5586000	Let's see how far we're going to...
5587000	5588000	Let's try to see if we can go here.
5589000	5590000	I gotta wait for it to load now.
5592000	5593000	Little crystals coming together.
5594000	5595000	There we go.
5596000	5597000	Exactly.
5598000	5599000	There we go. That's the song I know.
5600000	5602000	This is what I bought my WonderSwan color for.
5603000	5604000	I played the crap out of this.
5604000	5616000	So anyway, in the past, Bandai had done a bunch of handheld games.
5617000	5623000	They did a lot of licensing, like they had Tetsu on Adam, which we got as Astro Boy.
5624000	5626000	They did LCD games in the 70s.
5627000	5631000	They did the Intellivision in Japan.
5632000	5633000	They worked a lot for the Famicom.
5634000	5637000	And then they had, of course, the Tamagotchi and Digimon.
5638000	5639000	So we knew that that was a thing.
5640000	5645000	So they basically went in a bit further and kind of did this on their own without other support.
5648000	5652000	We also knew that Yokoi created the Game Boy for Nintendo.
5653000	5661000	But after the Virtual Boy kind of went kaput, he created Kodoo Laboratories so that they could work with Bandai to make the WonderSwan to compete with the Game Boy.
5661000	5666000	So basically, he kind of parented two systems here, right?
5667000	5671000	So moving onward, they picked the name WonderSwan because of its aesthetics.
5672000	5674000	It had a 30 hour battery life.
5675000	5678000	I don't think it really was that close to it, but it did okay.
5679000	5680000	It came with all kinds of colors. Nine colors.
5681000	5683000	Some of them discontinued later on.
5684000	5688000	And I mean, as you can hear, the music was amazing.
5688000	5694000	So I would say it was more on par with the Game Gear and Lynx as far as its capabilities.
5695000	5703000	And then later on, the WonderSwan Color came out that had the full color screen and had backward compatibility with the WonderSwan games.
5704000	5710000	And it came in different colors and had the special edition for Final Fantasy 1 and 2, which is the one that I have.
5711000	5713000	I forgot to take a picture or I would show everybody.
5713000	5727000	And then the Swan Crystal came out in 2002 and it was actually 7800 yen, which was about 1000 yen less than the Game Boy Advance.
5728000	5730000	And it looked better and it sounded better.
5731000	5738000	It had a much better screen on it, but Nintendo already had a little bit more of the name recognition and it was only released in Japan.
5738000	5744000	So it didn't have the international support, you know, that Nintendo of course had with a lot of this.
5745000	5751000	They also were powered, get this, by a single AA battery. All of them.
5752000	5753000	As crazy.
5754000	5759000	Yes. The Swan series were all from the single AA battery.
5760000	5771000	The WonderSwan Color, just double checking, it actually had 512 kilobits of RAM, which for the handheld at its time, was pretty amazing.
5772000	5777000	The WonderSwan Color would last about 20 hours with the battery.
5777000	5786000	In this one, Crystal actually had a little bit less because it was also a more powerful system, but it lasted 15 hours.
5787000	5789000	So really kind of negligible because who's going to sit and play it for 15 hours, right?
5790000	5798000	There were also other accessories. There's one called the Wonder Witch, which is a software development kit for amateur programmers.
5799000	5800000	Which is what I call myself on the weekends.
5801000	5805000	Girl. But it also allowed people to develop games and see.
5805000	5811000	There was an adapter for headphones, because it didn't have a headphone port.
5812000	5819000	Kind of like what they did with the, which of the Game Boy models was it that had this, the SP.
5820000	5821000	Like the adapter for that.
5822000	5829000	It also had a remote controlled robot called the WonderBorg, that you could operate with your WonderSwan.
5829000	5837000	It can be connected to a pocket station to transfer save files, and it used a device called the WonderWave to do that.
5838000	5847000	So, and it also became one of the early internet capable handhelds that used a phone network.
5848000	5849000	So really great stuff.
5850000	5851000	She got on the internet too? Jesus.
5852000	5855000	Right? I mean the thing was really ahead of its time.
5856000	5857000	Sorry.
5858000	5863000	So other games that came out on it, of course, and I'm even just thinking of the ones that I have.
5864000	5866000	They had a version of Go to Pay, of course.
5867000	5873000	It had Final Fantasy, Final Fantasy II, Final Fantasy IV, Space Invaders, Densha de Go!
5874000	5877000	We had Beat Mania. We had some Clone Ola games.
5878000	5881000	I've got a Digimon game myself. I think I might have mentioned it.
5881000	5886000	There was, um, hold on, I'm going to pull up the list of games here real quick.
5887000	5890000	So, let's see.
5891000	5893000	So we've also had Ark of the Lad on it.
5894000	5898000	Um, and I'm looking at just the color games here. A ton of Digimon, a Dragon Ball game.
5899000	5906000	We had Final Fantasy III was scheduled for it and cancelled, Front Mission came out, Golden Axe, Guilty Gear Petite, that's the other game I have.
5906000	5912000	Um, uh, Hatsuraku Chocobo, which is Working Chocobo, another Square game.
5913000	5918000	Um, Inuyasha games. We had a bunch of Gundam games.
5919000	5924000	Um, Makai Toshi Saga, Mr. Driller, Namco Super Wars.
5925000	5927000	Um, Romancing Saga, Rockman EXE.
5928000	5933000	And I think that on the original one there was, um, Rockman and Bass, wasn't it?
5933000	5937000	Came out. They were going to put Secret of Mana on it and that got cancelled.
5938000	5942000	Uh, had Super Robot Tyson compact. Uh, had a Yamato game.
5943000	5948000	Just all kinds of stuff. It was, it was pretty amazing. Great library.
5949000	5956000	Um, there are, and by the way, there are emulators out there, like I, though I wouldn't say emulate it, but maybe the only way you can try some of these games.
5957000	5960000	Yeah, maybe. Unless you want to pay like 800 bucks for one on eBay of somebody linked in our chat room.
5960000	5965000	Yeah. Well, I've got mine and it'll play everything that I want it to, but, you know.
5966000	5967000	So screw everybody else.
5968000	5971000	You know, the one thing though is that I kind of want a black and white one because of Beatmania.
5972000	5975000	Because Beatmania had a little add-on that was the scratch wheel.
5976000	5981000	And it doesn't fit very well on the, um, the color. Because the color's a little thicker.
5982000	5983000	Yeah, yeah.
5984000	5988000	But, um, it was really fun playing Beatmania with that because you just have to figure out, you know, map where your buttons are and then there you go.
5988000	5996000	So, um, I honestly think that if someone has a chance to get their hands on a WonderSwan, totally go for it.
5997000	6001000	Even if it's just the first model WonderSwan, it's an amazing little handheld system.
6002000	6007000	And, um, I even think to this day it's still pretty excellent competition.
6008000	6012000	Yeah, especially just considering like how ahead of its time it was in some ways. It's just, you know, we just didn't get it here.
6012000	6018000	It's like a lot of the systems that I've, you know, put on the list were, I'd honestly say, ahead of their time.
6019000	6023000	You know, but the WonderSwan color is probably, um, among one of my favorites.
6024000	6028000	Alright. There it is, your classic console of the month, the WonderSwan family.
6029000	6032000	Oh, another point? When I bought my WonderSwan color, it was at Game Masters and Burlingame.
6032000	6033000	Uh-huh.
6034000	6041000	No, was it Game Masters? I forgot. You know the store. I also bought my copy of, um, uh, great.
6042000	6047000	The name, the little stick figure with the music. Vib ribbon.
6048000	6049000	Vib ribbon? Yeah.
6050000	6052000	Yeah. I got my copy of Vib ribbon the same day and Kitty the Cool.
6053000	6054000	Nice. Best day ever.
6055000	6060000	Right? I came out of that game that day making out like a bandit and Dan picked up like a bunch of Saturn games.
6060000	6061000	Cool.
6061000	6062000	So, I just remember that was a good day.
6063000	6068000	Alright. There it is, your classic console of the month. Dark Soccer will be back with a game next week.
6069000	6074000	But in the meantime, we're going to take a quick break. There is more Orange Lounge Radio to come, including news on No Man's Sky.
6075000	6076000	That's right. We're going to talk about that when we come back.
6077000	6080000	And we're going to talk a little bit about the Final Fantasy VII remake and a little bit about Zelda Breath of the Wild as well.
6081000	6084000	And of course, your phone calls, Orange Lounge Radio on Skype.
6084000	6087000	Your emails participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
6088000	6091000	And much more when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
6098000	6102000	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio. Live tonight, March the 12th of 2017.
6103000	6106000	Episode number 679 of our show already in progress.
6107000	6110000	We'll be getting to your call soon at Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.
6110000	6117000	And then, of course, we always have our chat room as well over at live.voggenetwork.com where why are we talking about the N-Gage in chat right now?
6118000	6121000	What is the N-Gage chat happening right now in chat?
6122000	6123000	I had one.
6124000	6126000	You had one? You did? I forgot about that.
6127000	6129000	Yeah, remember I was like the only one who went over to the N-Gage booth at E3?
6130000	6131000	Because they looked lonely.
6132000	6133000	Yeah, they did look lonely. They didn't give you an N-Gage though, did they?
6134000	6136000	No, Dan and I had N-Gages. Both of us did.
6137000	6138000	Oh, I don't even remember that.
6138000	6142000	We did a couple of other friends because, well, I think at the time Dan was working at Gamestop.
6143000	6144000	Yeah.
6145000	6146000	But something like that.
6147000	6148000	Yeah, so probably, you know, got one as a preview or whatever.
6149000	6150000	Yeah.
6151000	6152000	To talk it up to potential sales.
6153000	6154000	Yeah.
6155000	6160000	Yeah. Oh, dear N-Gage. The good old taco phone. How I miss they. Anyway, we were enjoying some nice food there during the break. Some Stroopwafel, of course.
6161000	6162000	You know, the must have here at OLR.
6162000	6167000	And then, so you or Alan, somebody found those marshmallow Peep cookies.
6168000	6169000	I saw them and I had to have them.
6170000	6173000	But they're, okay, they're not, they don't taste like Peeps at all.
6174000	6181000	Like I know DarkSakura, not a fan of the marshmallow stuff, but those cookies don't, like they taste like nothing to me. They literally, it tastes like nothing.
6182000	6183000	It doesn't taste like soap, but it tastes like nothing to me.
6184000	6186000	I mean, to me, I think they're better than Oreos, but worse than Peeps.
6187000	6191000	I guess so. And then, there's Carrot Cake Hershey's Kisses.
6192000	6198000	Which I saw at Rite Aid and it was one of those, like, I have to just buy this to see like if this is for real.
6199000	6201000	And then DarkSakura was willing to try one of those, but you were like, it tastes like soap.
6202000	6207000	Yeah. I just, anything that tastes that sweet that I would have normally liked before, it just tastes absolutely bizarre.
6208000	6209000	I'm sorry.
6210000	6213000	I don't know if it's the antibiotics or if it's my own fucked up nose or whatever.
6214000	6215000	Or I just wanted to wash your mouth out with soap.
6216000	6219000	I'm way beyond washing my mouth out with soap.
6219000	6223000	I'd have to, like, deep throat an assembly line at Dove.
6224000	6227000	Dove chocolates or Dove soap? Alright, anyway.
6228000	6229000	We'll see.
6230000	6235000	Alright, let's do some rapid fire news, some other quick news stories here that happened in the past week in games. Loki.
6236000	6240000	The closed beta for Gran Turismo Sports is going to be starting actually in a few days. Looks like on March 17th.
6240000	6245000	Select PlayStation Network users will get invited to participate in the beta.
6246000	6251000	And when you do get invited, you get the selection of cars you can check out each day.
6252000	6259000	And of course, you know, it has like the driver profile and stuff that tracks your sportsmanship and race performance.
6260000	6267000	So cool. I wonder if they have the VR in there as well, because I know that's a feature of the game, but that'd be cool to try that out.
6267000	6269000	Yeah. I'd be curious what that looks like.
6270000	6274000	Now I completely forgot that they were doing a live action movie for this, but apparently they are.
6275000	6281000	So Just Cause, they have their lead actor in the film, Jason Momoa.
6282000	6291000	And you may remember Jason from such roles as Khal Drago in Game of Thrones, or he's also going to be Aquaman in the new Justice League movie.
6292000	6300000	But apparently he is going to be playing Rico Rodriguez, which I don't know how they can do that in the movie, but it sounds awesome.
6301000	6303000	So I'm down to check it out.
6304000	6310000	Yeah. We'll see if they finally make a good video game movie, but let's just say my hopes aren't very high.
6311000	6316000	You just can't really capture the nonsense that's in Just Cause with a movie, but I hope that they do.
6316000	6321000	Well, some folks in chat are excited about that. Bonds006 says, nice. I will watch a Just Cause film.
6322000	6326000	Brad from Pod Culture points out Ronan from Stargate Atlantis.
6327000	6334000	But I know that Aquaman made a cameo in the Batman and Superman movie, right? Which I watched on the plane, and I was like, this is ridiculous.
6335000	6337000	That was my whole feedback on Batman vs Superman.
6338000	6340000	Aquaman and the Brave and the Bold, though, was fucking hilarious.
6341000	6342000	That's pretty funny.
6342000	6346000	The best thing about Batman vs Superman, no joke, was Wonder Woman. It was the whole reason to watch the damn movie.
6347000	6349000	That's the only good thing I've heard anybody say about that movie.
6350000	6351000	What's that?
6352000	6353000	Actually, the new trailer looks pretty good.
6354000	6355000	I'll check out the Wonder Woman movie.
6356000	6357000	That will be the first DC movie I pay money for.
6358000	6367000	I mean, the movie, to me, looks exactly like Captain America. It's like, this is fucking Captain America with Wonder Woman, which is fine. I mean, it looks cool. It just gets so many Captain America vibes from it.
6367000	6372000	I wonder if they're going to have her weakness in it, where if she's bound by a man, she loses her powers.
6373000	6374000	I hope they have her truth lasso.
6375000	6379000	Well, you know how she was created, right? She was created by the polygraph inventor.
6380000	6388000	And her lasso was supposed to be, but he was also really into BDSM, so that's why her weakness came in as being bound.
6389000	6393000	It's also the reason there's a super dickery site, you know, all of these panels.
6394000	6395000	Yeah. Ugh.
6395000	6403000	Alright, well, we'll see. VidPower in chat says, the audience erupted when Wonder Woman came on screen in Buffy vs Superman.
6404000	6405000	Buffy would win.
6406000	6414000	Why did I read BvS as Buffy vs Superman? Just instantly my mind went to Buffy. Because everybody's been talking about Buffy because of the anniversary this week.
6415000	6417000	Well, it's also because Buffy was abbreviated BTVS.
6418000	6420000	Yeah, that's what it is. Thank you, JD.
6421000	6424000	Is Superman going to be like a vampire in that?
6425000	6426000	How's that going to work?
6427000	6430000	We already know Buffy will beat Edward Cullen.
6431000	6437000	Okay, thank you, Act F, just pointing out BvS Buffy Vampire Slayer. So that is a common acronym that's used there.
6438000	6443000	So it's not crazy that I instantly went to Buffy vs Superman, which is the movie they really should have made, let's be real.
6444000	6450000	Alright, anyway, let's talk about Bloodstained Ritual of the Night, a video game that could be better than Buffy.
6450000	6454000	Nah, I don't know if anything will be better than Buffy, but Bloodstained will be pretty cool.
6455000	6462000	It is confirmed, Bloodstained Ritual of the Night, it is coming to the Switch. Confirmed through a Nintendo of Europe advertisement.
6463000	6469000	Bloodstained is now slated for the Switch. This game, of course, is already bumped back to 2018, so they have plenty of time to put it together.
6470000	6478000	No clue if it will still release on Wii U. There has been no formal word on that yet, but I have a feeling Nintendo's probably going to pull the plug on Wii U before 2018.
6478000	6488000	They're probably going to shut that thing down as fast as they can. Although, it's worth pointing out, we didn't bring it up earlier, but even though the Switch had all these releases this week,
6489000	6496000	Nintendo Wii U did get a release this week on Virtual Console of all places, because I guess since there is still a Virtual Console on Wii U,
6497000	6505000	Bomberman 64 was released on the Wii U this week, so if you are a Bomberman fan, I think Bomberman 64 is one of the ones that a lot of people remember.
6505000	6514000	So, they may not pull the plug on Wii U that fast, but yeah, so it'll be interesting to see if Bloodstained still releases on Wii U, but I'm thinking probably not.
6515000	6521000	You should probably plan on picking it up on the Switch, but at least that is confirmed that that will be coming there to no one's surprise whatsoever.
6522000	6531000	Let's see, meanwhile, Wonder Boy the Dragon's Trap, another game that's slated for the Nintendo Switch, but this one will also be on the PlayStation 4 and the Xbox One,
6531000	6540000	and then there will be a PC version later in the spring. This game is slated for April the 18th of 2017, that's when it's going to be hitting all those platforms.
6541000	6547000	Remember, this is the one that lets you switch between the current graphics and the really cool hand-drawn graphics just by tapping a button, really.
6548000	6559000	And what's also cool is that if you have old passwords, they work in the new game, so everything that you remember about Wonder Boy from the Sega Master System will come over to this game.
6559000	6564000	So, Dark Soccer, do you still have Sega Master System codes for Wonder Boy written down somewhere?
6565000	6568000	Probably somewhere. Well, and if not, there's the internet.
6569000	6576000	There is this place called the internet, yes. So you can put in all the codes you want there on the remake, so that's pretty cool. Moving on, Dark Soccer.
6577000	6588000	Well, for those who are excited about Mario Kart 8, it has a new unlockable character for beating the hardest difficulty, which is a gold palette swap for Mario.
6589000	6596000	And no one curr. That's neat. Yeah. Period.
6597000	6603000	And then, happiness, Wreck-It Ralph 2 is a year away! Yay! I love Wreck-It Ralph.
6604000	6611000	But they basically, you're getting the voice cast back and everything is going to be awesome, and I see Qbert, so that makes me happy.
6612000	6616000	And I see Eggman and Balrog, or Bison, so that makes me happy too.
6616000	6629000	So, I wonder if we're going to see actual other video game stuff, as opposed to in the first movie it was mostly made up things, like Sugar Rush was a made up thing, and the whole Fix-It Felix and Wreck-It Ralph, that was all a made up thing.
6630000	6639000	I remember, of course, the Street Fighter characters showed up, and there was cameos, but you didn't really get to see those other worlds, so I wonder if you'll get to see the other worlds this time.
6639000	6645000	There's also Alan Tudyk's in it. He was King Candy before, but he's pretty versatile with voices, so I'm pretty excited.
6646000	6651000	Maybe there'll be a flashback, or maybe there's Robo King or something. Maybe he's back.
6652000	6657000	Or they get another, whatever he was supposed to be, Roadblasters. Or Turbo, whatever.
6658000	6661000	Turbo, that's it. He probably comes back from the dead one way or another, I'm sure.
6662000	6664000	Oh yes, because it wouldn't be without it.
6665000	6666000	Of course not.
6667000	6668000	Yeah, but that's it.
6669000	6673000	Let's travel around the world and check out what is coming out in game stores this week, starting here in the US. Loki.
6674000	6678000	So we've got Danganronpa 1-2 Reload on PlayStation 4.
6679000	6680000	Pass. Just kidding.
6681000	6682000	Bitch.
6683000	6685000	You still need to sit and play it.
6686000	6688000	Now if you may pass on that, this might be something you might be more interested in.
6689000	6692000	Star Trek Bridge Crew on the Vive, Rift, and PlayStation VR.
6693000	6697000	Well I don't have any of those VR things, but maybe I will borrow yours.
6698000	6703000	I want to see the folks at the Starboard Power Coupling play this game together.
6704000	6717000	I think it would be hilarious to get Dr. Ken Rip Roaring Drunk and Captain Matt and Lieutenant Eddie and get him high on life.
6718000	6723000	And make him eat the whole bag of Peeps cookies and then play this game.
6724000	6726000	I think they'd have a lot of fun with that.
6727000	6730000	Anyway, hopefully that'll be a thing that happens.
6731000	6737000	And then Styx Shards of Darkness on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.
6738000	6744000	Excel World vs Sword Art Online Millennium Twilight on PlayStation 4 and the Vita.
6745000	6750000	We have Kona on PC, Mac, and Linux, Xbox One, and PlayStation 4.
6751000	6754000	And Nier Automata on PC.
6754000	6758000	And last but not least, Senran Kagura Peach Beach Splash.
6759000	6763000	For those of you who may not know, Senran Kagura is a big breasted ninja game.
6764000	6771000	And this one of course goes the whole route of like, hey, we're just giving you some other excuses to have them in bikinis.
6772000	6775000	So they're literally squirting water on each other.
6776000	6778000	Yay!
6779000	6783000	Dark Sakura! Let's do Let's Play.
6786000	6790000	Yes, it's interesting. Just by the screenshots.
6791000	6794000	Sorry, this game is also in my Japanese releases.
6795000	6800000	And as I was going to put really quickly, just this quote from the page on Wikipedia for it.
6800000	6801000	Yes.
6812000	6816000	So it's literally a wet t-shirt contest as a game. That is literally what this is.
6817000	6821000	So this game is also out in Japan this week. Senran Kagura Peach Beach Splash.
6822000	6827000	And if you look at the cover, it's just ladies in white bikinis and super soakers.
6828000	6830000	This is the best version of Splatoon yet.
6835000	6837000	It would only be good if it had the same music.
6838000	6840000	The whole little like da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.
6841000	6844000	The little like ska music that like the little kids sing. It'll be hilarious.
6845000	6847000	Alright, anyway. Check that out coming to a...
6848000	6851000	I'm sorry, I have to look at some of these screenshots. It's one of those like I need to see it to believe.
6852000	6853000	Yep, I believe it.
6854000	6856000	This is so stupid.
6857000	6862000	Anyway, you can get that in a regular version in Japan on the 16th.
6863000	6865000	You can also get it in a new, new DX pack.
6866000	6867000	Ooh, DX.
6868000	6871000	Or a 5th anniversary DX pack. And if you say that real fast, it's Dix pack.
6872000	6875000	So you can get a 5th anniversary Dix pack in Japan.
6876000	6886000	You can also pick up a game this week in Japan on the 16th on the PlayStation 4 called Kono Yono Hatte de Koi wa Yutao Shuzhou Yuno in a regular and limited edition.
6887000	6889000	It's called Rewrite out in Japan this week.
6890000	6895000	And Excel World vs Sword Art Online Millennium Twilight, which I think Loki referenced here in the US.
6896000	6899000	And then Disgaea 5 gets a price reduction this week as well in Japan.
6900000	6902000	So pretty exciting time for you folks over there.
6903000	6906000	On the Vita this week, that same Sword Art Online vs Excel World game is there as well.
6907000	6912000	As well as that Kono Yono Hatte de Koi wa Yutao Shuzhou is out there as well.
6913000	6915000	However, Peach Beach nowhere to be seen on the Vita.
6915000	6920000	So I'm sorry you need the full 1080p experience on your PlayStation 4 for that one.
6921000	6926000	On the Nintendo Switch this week, nothing in Japan. At least not retail.
6927000	6929000	I don't know what their online service looks like. I don't get those dates.
6930000	6935000	But I do have some dates for the 3DS, which include Monster Hunter XX is out on the 18th.
6936000	6941000	That's a pretty big deal and you get all the accessories that come with it as well as the limited edition new 3DS XL.
6942000	6943000	LL as they call it over there.
6943000	6948000	And then another game that dares to compete against it just two days sooner, Future Card Buddy Fight Mezase.
6949000	6952000	Buddy Champion is released in Japan this week.
6953000	6954000	How about the UK?
6955000	6956000	One thing.
6957000	6958000	Yeah, too dark for PC.
6959000	6960000	How dark?
6961000	6962000	Two.
6963000	6964000	Oh, the number two.
6965000	6966000	So dark they made a movie about it.
6967000	6968000	It was perfect.
6968000	6973000	Alright, moving on. Let's get back into some news. No, we're going to do the mailbag first.
6974000	6975000	I apologize. We got to get to our emailers.
6976000	6979000	Participate at orangelaungeradio.com to send us emails every week.
6980000	6984000	Dark Soccer is going to dive in the mailbag and find emails that are worthy of her attention.
6985000	6986000	Sticky!
6987000	6991000	Hello, OLR. First of all, a very belated congratulations to Rob and Alan for getting married.
6992000	6993000	I hope you guys are enjoying married life.
6994000	6995000	Smile!
6995000	7001000	I wanted to comment on last week's episode about Mass Effect Andromeda getting a mature rating because of some full nudity in the game.
7002000	7003000	Yay!
7004000	7005000	An email about nudity.
7006000	7007000	Naked.
7008000	7012000	I was watching a trailer for the game and it hit me how violent it is shooting various alien races in the face.
7013000	7015000	This does not seem to earn it a mature rating.
7016000	7017000	Sorry.
7018000	7020000	Loki's laughing in the kitchen for some reason at this whole thing.
7021000	7022000	What?
7023000	7024000	Shooting alien races in the face.
7025000	7027000	This does not seem to earn an immature rating.
7028000	7029000	Yet the sex does. How typical.
7030000	7031000	I'm sure I'm preaching to the choir here.
7032000	7035000	Well, I don't think, I mean, yes, you shoot things in the face.
7036000	7037000	I don't think it's blood goes everywhere.
7038000	7039000	I don't recall that in the older games.
7040000	7041000	But it's still violence.
7042000	7045000	It is. It is. But it's more like the Star Trek phasers never really cause blood to show up.
7046000	7047000	It's kind of that whole violence.
7048000	7049000	It should have cauterization burned.
7049000	7065000	Yeah, you know, but that, I always kind of saw that as the violence in, but I mean, granted, you could set things on fire, you could ice them and then shatter the ice and stuff, but it just, it was like, but that would happen in Super Nintendo Mortal Kombat as well, which was sanitized for violence.
7066000	7071000	So I think it's just that there's not blood everywhere kind of helps it in that regard.
7072000	7081000	However, I do want to say that a well done lovemaking scene in a video game does add a lot as it can, as it can do in a movie.
7082000	7087000	In The Witcher 3, for example, there's plenty of lovemaking to be done if you romance the right characters.
7088000	7090000	I do think it adds something meaningful to the storytelling.
7091000	7094000	It would be too bad if games were to shy away from this for fear of a mature rating.
7095000	7097000	That's it. Love the show as always. Martin the Belgian.
7097000	7106000	P.S. being a native Dutch speaker, I'd like to inform you of the correct pronunciation of, ah, I was right the second time, stropwafel.
7107000	7112000	So it's stropwafel, like the ah versus the oh.
7113000	7124000	I respect that we're probably saying it wrong. However, in this instance, I'm going to play my big stupid American card and be willfully ignorant because I'm sorry, strupwafel sounds cooler.
7125000	7126000	And I like stropwafel.
7127000	7131000	If you're going to look for strupwafel on the store shelf, you'll know exactly how to spell it.
7132000	7140000	Pronounce the oh oh as you would pronounce the oh in hope, not the word hoop. Like it were stropwafel.
7141000	7142000	Stropwafel.
7143000	7144000	That actually sounds cooler. Strupwafel.
7145000	7146000	I like strupwafel.
7147000	7150000	The word strop means syrup in Dutch. So it literally is a pressed waffle with syrup in the middle.
7151000	7152000	What's strop mean? Does it mean like...
7153000	7154000	He just said it means...
7155000	7156000	Penis or something?
7157000	7158000	What's strup mean?
7159000	7160000	Okay, Martin, tell us.
7162000	7164000	Give us an answer, please.
7165000	7170000	You know, actually, it's funny. A Dutch person corrected me on how to say my last name. My real one.
7171000	7172000	Oh, really? Interesting.
7173000	7176000	But I was like, but it's been Americanized.
7177000	7181000	I know my actual last name is also Dutch, and I'm sure we're saying it wrong, too, but whatever.
7182000	7190000	s2100matt points out in chat over at live.vognetwork.com that same reason why some New Yorkers pronounce Mario differently. They say Mario, right?
7191000	7200000	And that's kind of, I don't, when I hear Mario, I go, oh, it's not it. But then, you know, everybody has a different accent and we have to respect that, you know.
7201000	7202000	We don't have to respect stupid people, though.
7203000	7205000	Hey, well, I just because somebody says Mario doesn't make him stupid.
7206000	7210000	I didn't say it made him stupid. Just stupid people have stupid opinions sometimes and they're stupid.
7211000	7212000	And wrong.
7213000	7217000	Like me saying Stroopwafel. I'm going to be willfully stupid in this case. I don't care.
7218000	7219000	You ignorant.
7220000	7221000	That's right.
7222000	7223000	Ignorant.
7224000	7227000	I claim this name, or I claim Stroop, I claim it in the name of America. All your Stroopwafel are belong to us.
7228000	7232000	I'm going to say Stroopwafel. Stroopwafel. That just sounds cooler.
7233000	7234000	Ellen!
7235000	7236000	Stroopwafel or Stroopwafel?
7237000	7238000	Stroopwafel.
7239000	7240000	Ellen agrees with me.
7241000	7242000	Stroopwafel.
7243000	7244000	Stroopwafel. Whatever.
7245000	7248000	Hello, LR. Of course, I'm going to email you guys about Xbox Live Creators Program.
7249000	7250000	Oh, I already know who this is. Hi, YYR.
7251000	7252000	Well, who else sends us hello, LR?
7253000	7256000	Thanks for covering it on last week's show. I figured I'd clarify a few things about it.
7257000	7260000	First and foremost, yes, it is most definitely the new Xbox Live indie games.
7261000	7265000	Similarly, there is very little barrier to entry and there will be little to no curation.
7265000	7269000	Likewise, it will be separated from the main Xbox One store.
7270000	7277000	Just as with Xbox Live indie game XBLIG. I'm going to call it XBLIG because it's fun.
7278000	7281000	Games published on the service will not be allowed to have achievement.
7282000	7289000	As far as peer review, nothing has been announced yet regarding this, but I have a hard time believing there will be no peer review or final approval of any kind.
7290000	7294000	Otherwise, games can be released with crash bugs, inappropriate content, copyrighted material, etc.
7295000	7297000	I have a feeling there will be something.
7298000	7300000	XBLIG. It's just funny calling it XBLIG.
7301000	7303000	Titles were allowed to have Xbox Live multiplayer features.
7304000	7307000	Interestingly, titles published through this new program will not.
7308000	7312000	Games featuring online multiplayer will have to be published via ID at Xbox instead.
7313000	7317000	However, one Xbox Live feature we will now have access to is leaderboards.
7318000	7321000	XBLIG previously did not allow these.
7321000	7326000	Having a portfolio consist mostly of arcade style games makes this relevant to my interests.
7327000	7334000	One major difference this time is that Microsoft is not giving a specific development software as they did with XNA last time.
7335000	7340000	To create these games, we can use anything that can produce UWP or Universal Windows Platform apps.
7341000	7343000	This includes frameworks like Unity and MonoGame.
7344000	7347000	MonoGame, by the way, is an open source replacement for XNA.
7348000	7351000	Porting XNA games to MonoGame generally takes a negligible amount of time.
7352000	7355000	So XBLIG ports are definitely going to be a thing.
7356000	7359000	I have already ported several of my own games to the MonoGame framework.
7360000	7362000	There's no need to recreate them or reinvent the wheel.
7363000	7367000	Speaking of those games, it is too early to make any announcements.
7368000	7372000	I can't even get into the program yet, but I guarantee you we'll see bungee ferret tossing again.
7373000	7377000	Maybe with added construction cranes and more ninjas. And more blood. A lot more blood.
7378000	7379000	We have to use that extra blood.
7380000	7381000	And nudity.
7382000	7383000	They just need to be random boobs.
7384000	7386000	Although, sadly, nudity would probably get him booted from the program.
7387000	7391000	He can put as much fake pixel blood as he wants in there, but the minute somebody in the background is like,
7392000	7397000	I love you ferret, and whips her tits out, it's going to get declined in the peer review.
7398000	7401000	We just need to have a space where that can go.
7401000	7406000	I understand that usually when you think of nudity, it's like adult games.
7407000	7411000	But I want, like, why can't we just have a decent game that also has nudity?
7412000	7416000	If nothing else, ladies in white bikinis, and men in white bikinis too, to be fair,
7417000	7419000	because we're equal opportunity here, shooting each other with squirt guns in the background.
7420000	7422000	Because at least you know that's okay.
7425000	7428000	A lot more blood, and we have to use that extra power somehow, right?
7429000	7430000	Please look forward to it.
7431000	7433000	I'm probably still heading home from round one while you're reading this,
7434000	7436000	but if you have more questions, I'll hear them out on the podcast.
7437000	7439000	Have a great week, Erin Yyr.
7440000	7445000	And moving on to the next email, if we're ready.
7446000	7448000	Hey, OLR crew, AZHP here.
7449000	7453000	On last week's show, you all mentioned that people should complain to the Better Business Bureau
7454000	7456000	when Amazon did not fulfill their launch day delivery switch promises.
7456000	7460000	While I'm all for consumer protection, the Better Business Bureau is not necessarily the best place to go
7461000	7463000	when that protection is necessary.
7464000	7467000	The reason for this is that the BBB is not actually any sort of governing entity,
7468000	7471000	but is basically a more official sounding Yelp, long before Yelp was a thing.
7472000	7476000	However, since the popular belief is that the BBB has some kind of authority,
7477000	7480000	BBB used this as leverage to make companies pay them to increase their rating.
7481000	7485000	It's extremely devious, and basically the business equivalent of the infamous
7486000	7489000	engagement ring must be two months salary, marketing campaign,
7490000	7493000	originated by DBears, which is so ingrained in the public consciousness
7494000	7497000	that people believe it to be an infallible rule.
7498000	7506000	I will also point out offhand, though, that having that review does reflect on the business,
7507000	7508000	so I'll go ahead and keep going.
7509000	7511000	Honestly, the best thing you can do in this case as a consumer
7512000	7514000	is that if you were affected, complain to Amazon's customer service.
7514000	7516000	You'll probably get a month extension on your Prime membership,
7517000	7520000	and a 10% refund on your order. $30 is nothing to sneeze at.
7521000	7523000	Meanwhile, I'm enjoying Zelda on my Wii U.
7524000	7530000	Sure, it's only 720p, but the framerate is the same as the game is on Switch in console mode,
7531000	7534000	although the portable mode apparently runs at a higher framerate.
7535000	7539000	I can explain this in a future email if you're interested in the technical details.
7539000	7547000	Sure, I can't play it on the Bart going to work or on my lunch break,
7548000	7553000	but I didn't have to purchase or anxiously wait for another console to arrive in time for me to play it.
7554000	7555000	You're truly AZHP.
7556000	7560000	That's fascinating about the Better Business Bureau, and I honestly didn't know that,
7561000	7564000	especially the whole fact that it's just basically an old-school type of Yelp service.
7565000	7568000	I understand every time I read Yelp, I'm only going to see the bad stuff,
7569000	7573000	and the good stuff is probably a question mark, because it's probably the friends and relatives that wrote that,
7574000	7576000	and then people only go on that site to write reviews and they have problems,
7577000	7578000	so I understand there's issues with Yelp.
7579000	7581000	But the whole thing with Better Business Bureau, I thought there was a thing where you,
7582000	7583000	and I'm actually seeing it in chat, too.
7584000	7587000	SG100Matt says, the thing about BBB is that businesses have to respond to any claim against it.
7588000	7593000	If they have no power when it comes to governing or whatever, how does a business have to respond to it?
7593000	7599000	Or is that the whole, I guess, like, gotcha with the money thing that he's kind of referencing there?
7600000	7602000	Well, it's like SEO, you know, if you don't respond to it, it's still your name of your business,
7603000	7605000	and it shows up in a source that people think is reputable.
7606000	7609000	Which is kind of the same strong army that Yelp does, which is kind of making them controversial in a way.
7610000	7615000	Well, that's fascinating, but I just, here's the thing, so, okay, so you know something I didn't there about that,
7616000	7620000	so thank you for sharing about that, but I just, I kind of disagree when it's the whole,
7620000	7626000	well, then the only avenue is to go to Amazon customer service and accept the pitillants that they give you,
7627000	7630000	you know, a month free of their own service type of thing.
7631000	7635000	It's kind of one of those things where it's like, all I really wanted in this scenario,
7636000	7638000	and honestly, I haven't checked in the past week to see if this has happened,
7639000	7641000	so I'm going to just say that up front. I don't know if this happened.
7642000	7647000	ActDeft, I know you got screwed by Amazon, so I'm curious if you got this.
7647000	7653000	Did Amazon, like, accept responsibility and apologize in that?
7654000	7656000	Did they accept responsibility and apologize?
7657000	7661000	I don't mean some person in customer service that's paid to do that on every single call.
7662000	7667000	Did the corporation accept responsibility and apologize and tell us how it's not going to happen again,
7668000	7670000	and what they're going to do different next time?
7671000	7673000	That's what I'm curious about. ActDeft in chat says not really, no.
7673000	7677000	That's the only thing I really want in this scenario, I think,
7678000	7681000	you know, is that Amazon needs to have their feet held to the fire a little bit
7682000	7685000	before we consider purchasing another system through them in the future.
7686000	7689000	I mean, disclosure, sorry, just disclosure, I had no issue with Amazon.
7690000	7693000	I got my switch through them, and I had no issue, but I understand a lot of other people did,
7694000	7699000	and so I think that's messed up for the people that also did the same thing I did. Sorry, Judy.
7699000	7703000	I was just going to say, I think that given how huge a company Amazon is,
7704000	7706000	they may not even care if it makes them look bad, you know?
7707000	7709000	I don't expect them to put anything out about this.
7710000	7712000	I kind of always thought that wasn't the case with Amazon, though,
7713000	7715000	that they were very, like, customer service oriented,
7716000	7718000	because don't they own that shoe site, Zappos or whatever?
7719000	7720000	I think they bought them.
7721000	7723000	Zappos is a huge thing as customer service.
7724000	7725000	That's like a huge thing for Zappos.
7726000	7727000	Right, but Amazon is like the everything store now.
7727000	7729000	Like maybe 10 years ago they would have cared, but now, I mean,
7730000	7734000	they just have so many different things that I don't think it's a big deal to them.
7735000	7737000	But don't forget, everything we said at the top of the show,
7738000	7741000	everything we said at the top of the show this week about Twitch and Amazon Company.
7742000	7743000	Alright.
7744000	7746000	Something to think about. Anyway, thank you very much for the email.
7747000	7750000	And all the emails, that was it tonight, yes?
7751000	7755000	Participate at orangelauntrader.com if you would like to email us in the future.
7755000	7757000	In the meantime, we still have some news to catch up on
7758000	7761000	before we get to your calls at Orange Lounge Radio. Loki.
7762000	7766000	Alright. So, No Man's Sky's getting an update.
7767000	7769000	And No Man Cares.
7770000	7773000	I haven't played it even before the last update, so.
7774000	7777000	Well, here's the thing. You know how PlayStation 4 got that boost mode this week?
7778000	7781000	Okay, so it doesn't do anything for Overwatch, but I wasn't expecting it to,
7782000	7783000	because I think Overwatch was after the pro was out anyway.
7783000	7785000	But I heard that No Man's Sky...
7786000	7787000	No Overwatch wasn't when the pro was out?
7788000	7791000	Well, I thought it supported the pro, but only like 4K menus.
7792000	7794000	It doesn't really enhance the game. Anyway, that stuff aside,
7795000	7798000	I heard that No Man's Sky gets a boost out of this boost mode,
7799000	7802000	so I do want to go back and check out that game now that boost mode is a thing.
7803000	7809000	I haven't tried playing Final Fantasy XV, I'm feeling a little shafted on this pro thing.
7810000	7812000	How about XIV? Oh, you don't play XIV on PS4 though?
7813000	7817000	But I heard that XIV also got a boost from this, so I guess I need to go back and check out that one.
7818000	7819000	So, anyway.
7820000	7825000	Anyway, so the Pathfinder update was a new update that's coming out,
7826000	7830000	and it's, I guess, some of the updates along with that.
7831000	7837000	On the PC version, it's going to allow players to share bases online through the online Steam workshop,
7837000	7844000	and also letting other people use and discover those bases and customize outposts.
7845000	7849000	Also, there's an Exocraft vehicle that's coming.
7850000	7855000	So, can you drive that?
7856000	7858000	That's what it sounds like. It sounds like it's a little moon buggy type of thing,
7859000	7862000	like the Mako in Mass Effect, but hopefully more drivable.
7862000	7869000	That's pretty cool. And then they said also that there's going to be ground, I guess, with a ground transport,
7870000	7874000	are going to be able to, that's one of the things that's coming with the ground transports,
7875000	7878000	and then you can also mine the store resources with the bases.
7879000	7887000	They're supposed to be adding a photo mode and improving the visuals for 4K on the PlayStation 4 Pro,
7887000	7898000	and better rail solutions on the PlayStation 4 and PC, including a permadeath mode, multi-tool specializations, and ship classes.
7899000	7901000	I'll tell you what, I'll play this game when they're done patching it.
7902000	7909000	I mean, like, I think I'll just start over, because I don't remember what I was doing, and fuck if I care anyways.
7910000	7913000	I'll start over when it's fun to play again.
7913000	7921000	Like, it's not just this inventory management hell, which I think it's gotten better, but it'll be nice, there'll be a whole new game again.
7922000	7923000	So you're saying, wake me up when the final version's out.
7924000	7928000	Exactly. Wake me up when the game of the year, okay, when it's complete edition.
7929000	7933000	Well, yeah, and to Hello Games' credit, they're not charging for any of this.
7934000	7935000	Yeah, exactly.
7936000	7937000	Because, oh my god, I can't even imagine.
7938000	7939000	It was a $60 game, they better not be fucking charged for any of this.
7939000	7941000	I can't even imagine the tweets they'd be getting if they were.
7942000	7944000	That would be very upsetting.
7945000	7951000	Alright, well good luck to them in putting that game together, and who knows, maybe they can turn it around like Diablo 3 got turned around.
7952000	7956000	If they fix Diablo 3 in the original Final Fantasy XIV, anything's possible.
7957000	7964000	Anyhow, Final Fantasy VII Remake, hopefully that's a good game when it comes out, but y'all better be ready for some changes.
7964000	7980000	This probably isn't going to surprise anybody, but Tetsuya Nomura mentioned in an interview with Famitsu this week that showed off some new Final Fantasy VII Remake screenshots, there will not be the battle system that you're used to in the original. That's gone.
7981000	7983000	Of course not, because they ripped the whole engine from XV.
7983000	7994000	Yeah, they don't confirm that, and they don't really talk about what the system is that's replacing it, but I mean, you look at these screenshots, it's like this was built in XV's engine very, very clearly.
7995000	8009000	It was, and even the stupid, remember in the whole shimmying along the little narrow wall areas and stuff like that, they have the same animation in the VII demo video thing that they add online.
8009000	8016000	So it's obviously in the XV engine, that's why they're not there, it's like, fuck, we don't want to implement a new battle system, we'll just use the one we fucking have.
8017000	8026000	What's worrying me about this is that it talks about how there's cover, and in an explanation, this is coming through a translation however, but in an explanation Nomura said,
8026000	8035000	in the story, in situations where you're sneaking around, you won't just be able to march down the middle of the path. The original version had random encounters, and such parts were in the realm of imagination.
8036000	8045000	But since this title is seamless, and you see the path that you're infiltrating, I decided it was necessary for the sake of realism. So you have stealth type of things instead of random encounters.
8045000	8056000	That sounds fucking awful, especially considering how chapter 13 in Final Fantasy XV turned out, which, spoiler alert, heavily involved stealth. And it was awful.
8057000	8074000	So, this concerns me big time. However, seeing as we only have a couple screenshots to go off of, and a translated quote, I'll give this a benefit of the doubt, I'm not going to come out and say, worst game ever, I'm over it, fuck it, you know, I'm not going to say any of that.
8075000	8087000	Just, I have concerns that I hope will be alleviated when there is a demo for this game, or some type of something more playable, which I'm imagining will have to be this year's E3, we'll really start to see more about this.
8088000	8090000	Well didn't they fix chapter 13, or are they going to fix chapter 13?
8091000	8093000	I think it is dated around the Gladio DLC release.
8094000	8102000	So maybe if they're fixing whatever the problem was, then they're going to fix it for this, or I don't know what exactly they're fixing, because I still haven't played past chapter 1.
8102000	8119000	Let's hope. Let's hope. So, anyway, I do want to say that also it was pointed out that you could just run into enemies and fight them if you prefer, but Barret can use cover as well, there's a special element in Gunners, but they're not saying anything on it yet.
8120000	8129000	There's also a screenshot out there of Cloud and Barret actually fighting the first boss in the game, which is, you know, you might remember from the original Final Fantasy VII, but it's totally different now, everything is different.
8129000	8143000	So, are they still, are they actually going to release this game as Final Fantasy VII Remake? Is that the actual name they're going to put on the box and sell it as? That's a weird name to me. Why don't they just call it Final Fantasy VII, or Reimagined or something?
8144000	8154000	Or Alterna VII. Or just 2017 edition, I don't know, it's weird to me. By the way, I'll just mention it here, because I thought I had it elsewhere on the show, but I don't see it.
8154000	8174000	Final Fantasy XII, they've been talking about that at PAX a little bit, and there are some special editions going up on sale right now. The Super Hela Mega Special Edition actually comes with Judge Busts, little metal busts of some of the judges in the game, which you might remember are kind of the antagonists in the game.
8174000	8191000	So, yeah. I mean, if you want to spend $200 on the Uber Special Limited Edition of Final Fantasy XII, you can get that, but I think I'll just take that regular one that's in a tin, thanks. But I'm super looking forward to Final Fantasy XII. Really looking forward to that. Anyhow, DarkSakura, what do you have for us?
8192000	8203000	Well, there's some news about Breath of the Wild. The whole reason that Link isn't wearing his little pointy hat, anyone want to guess why? It didn't look good.
8203000	8225000	It basically said, and this is the quote from Satoru Takazawa, as the graphic fidelity has increased, it becomes more difficult to make that hat look cool. As the game becomes more realistic, it's difficult to present it in a way that's appealing. So basically, it made him look like a big dork. Although there is a way to get it.
8225000	8230000	I was going to say, I thought somebody had shared on Twitter, like they had an outfit where they had the pointy hat.
8230000	8236000	You have to beat, well to get other parts of it, you have to beat all 120 shrines.
8236000	8238000	That's a lot.
8238000	8241000	We've maybe done like 50.
8241000	8243000	I'm like, have I even found 12?
8243000	8246000	Some of them are really close to each other too.
8246000	8251000	Stop having stupid rewards for really hard challenges, is what I'm saying.
8251000	8253000	They're not that hard.
8253000	8256000	I feel like a costume throwback is not a stupid reward.
8257000	8263000	It goes like, was it the metal skin, the gold Mario for being, it's like that's stupid.
8263000	8266000	You know what would be a great reward is a weapon that doesn't break.
8266000	8268000	That will happen.
8268000	8270000	The master sword apparently.
8270000	8272000	The master sword.
8273000	8277000	The royal claymore and the royal bow, those have been really good.
8277000	8282000	But we kind of skipped the Gerudo part. Not the Gerudo part, we've skipped the Goron part.
8282000	8287000	Or as we've been calling them, the Morons, the Gorgonzola. We've come up with all kinds of names.
8287000	8292000	We figured that the Gorons and the Zoras were once a race called the Gorgonzolas.
8292000	8294000	So anyway.
8294000	8299000	You know that this has the cartridges. I wonder if they can do like a Game Genie pro-action replay type thing with it.
8299000	8301000	Doubt it.
8301000	8305000	What I was saying is we're now where the bird people are.
8305000	8309000	And it's actually interesting. We go into different parts and get things that help you with other parts.
8309000	8311000	So just the interplay is pretty awesome.
8311000	8314000	I'm where the water people are. That's what I'm doing right now.
8314000	8316000	Yeah, that part was cool.
8316000	8318000	You're at the heffalump.
8318000	8320000	Yes.
8320000	8327000	Also, I do see the screenshots floating around Twitter of where I guess if you were Link and you walk up to the edge of a bridge or whatever.
8327000	8332000	Somebody walking on the bridge will actually tell you, don't do it. There's a lot to live for and all this stuff.
8332000	8336000	There's so many little intricacies in the game.
8336000	8340000	Was it the dog where if you run in circles next to a dog, the dog will chase its tail?
8340000	8342000	Yeah, the dog will chase its tail.
8342000	8345000	There's just little ridiculous things that are what make this game so great.
8345000	8352000	Get this. Pick up a cuckoo. The chickens go out in front of an enemy.
8352000	8354000	I saw this. I saw that GIF on Twitter.
8354000	8355000	I haven't seen it.
8355000	8357000	The chicken barrage comes back.
8357000	8363000	But you get it to attack the enemy. You throw the chicken in front of the enemy when it attacks the enemy.
8363000	8365000	You have to hold the chicken while it attacks you.
8365000	8369000	And when it hits the chicken, all of its chicken buddies come out and beat the shit out of it.
8369000	8371000	And it will kill a Hinox.
8371000	8372000	Nice.
8372000	8373000	That's pretty cool.
8373000	8375000	I can see that they're in a Ganon fight.
8375000	8378000	Can I use the chicken to beat Ganon? That would be awesome.
8378000	8379000	That would be great.
8379000	8381000	Excuse me, Calamity Ganon.
8381000	8386000	Well, at this point though, I may have to excuse myself.
8386000	8387000	Sure.
8387000	8391000	Because I am still recovering, as you can hear in my voice.
8391000	8392000	Yep.
8392000	8396000	So I would like to bid our listeners a fond adieu for the evening.
8396000	8398000	Farewell, DarkSakura. Thank you for being here.
8398000	8399000	Thank you for having me.
8399000	8401000	Do you have any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?
8401000	8402000	Resist.
8402000	8405000	Alright. Feel better, and we'll see you in seven days.
8405000	8406000	Thank you.
8406000	8407000	Awesome.
8407000	8411000	Alright, well, while DarkSakura decides to head out for the evening to take care of herself,
8411000	8414000	we're going to move on with just a couple more stories for you guys here. Loki.
8414000	8421000	So, Pokemon Go has hinted to have, actually, the legendary Pokemon starting to appear later this year.
8421000	8424000	Or at least it's been hinted at several times before.
8424000	8430000	But now, with an interview with John Hank of Niantic,
8430000	8435000	basically said, I can safely say we'll see more of it this year.
8435000	8438000	Which could be, you know, more new Pokemon.
8438000	8444000	Apparently it was out of a German article that was regarding the legendary Pokemon, but...
8444000	8448000	Or it could just be a fucking cock tease so they don't have any fucking plans whatsoever for you.
8448000	8451000	Well, see more announcements of it later this year, yes.
8451000	8453000	I can see it now.
8453000	8456000	Look, I do like Niantic a lot.
8456000	8458000	I've lost a lot of fucking free time to Ingress.
8458000	8461000	A lot of fucking free time to Ingress.
8461000	8463000	And now Pokemon Go.
8463000	8465000	I don't even play Ingress as much as I used to.
8465000	8467000	Now Ingress is one of those things where it's like,
8467000	8470000	Oh, there's a field over my house, I guess I should go fuck it up.
8470000	8472000	You know, that's my Ingress playing now.
8472000	8475000	Pokemon Go, I still kind of roll with that.
8475000	8479000	And I still get pissed off at all these memes that are like,
8479000	8481000	No one plays Pokemon Go or no one cares about Pokemon Go.
8481000	8484000	Because I probably do more walking because of Pokemon Go.
8484000	8488000	But I can say that and at the same time still go.
8488000	8492000	It is really like kind of bullshit some of the things Niantic is doing with this whole like,
8492000	8494000	you know, the legendary still aren't in the game.
8494000	8497000	They don't seem to be doing any type of live events or any of this stuff.
8497000	8500000	And I get they got to space things out to make things more exciting,
8500000	8503000	but they have, oh, five more generations worth of Pokemon
8503000	8507000	that they're still going to be like teasing over the next years and years and years to be working with.
8507000	8509000	So, I don't know.
8509000	8511000	SSG100Matt in chat says,
8511000	8513000	Speaking of which, I need to cash out of gyms right now.
8513000	8517000	Yeah, that's the thing that I would like Niantic to kind of work on is like make the gym interesting.
8517000	8521000	Like it's the gym game is stupid right now. It's really stupid.
8521000	8522000	All it is...
8522000	8523000	It's like no point.
8523000	8525000	It's Rhyhorn's, Vaporeon's, Blissey's.
8525000	8527000	Uh, what else? What am I missing?
8527000	8528000	Gyrodos.
8528000	8529000	Snorlax.
8529000	8530000	Snorlax.
8530000	8531000	Then that's it.
8531000	8532000	Lapras maybe?
8532000	8534000	Maybe Lapras or one of, no, Lapras got nerfed.
8534000	8535000	Dragonite's.
8535000	8536000	Okay, Dragonite's. That's it.
8536000	8541000	So, my point is out of the now 250 Pokemon in this game,
8541000	8546000	it's the same fucking 10, and that's being generous because it's really more like 6,
8546000	8549000	but it's the same fucking 10 that are always the ones that take gyms.
8549000	8551000	Just wait until we get legendaries.
8551000	8552000	Ugh.
8552000	8553000	Ugh.
8553000	8554000	Ugh.
8554000	8555000	Ugh.
8555000	8557000	Anyway, it's just, it's not interesting.
8557000	8558000	That's the thing.
8558000	8561000	So, that's why, but I'm not really super getting into the gym game,
8561000	8568000	but it's like, well, I would like to have all that fucking gold so I can buy things like, you know, incubators would be great.
8568000	8569000	Anyway.
8569000	8571000	Teddy Ursa. I saw a Teddy Ursa on a gym.
8571000	8572000	Teddy Ursa?
8572000	8573000	Not a Teddy Ursa, the Ursa.
8573000	8574000	Ursa Ring.
8574000	8575000	Yeah.
8575000	8576000	I saw one of those on a gym.
8576000	8577000	But that was a new-
8577000	8578000	For like a hot minute.
8578000	8580000	Who didn't know what they were putting down, or they were putting it down to Prestige.
8580000	8581000	It was pretty buff.
8581000	8582000	Prestige the gym.
8582000	8584000	Ursa Ring is up there in stats.
8584000	8586000	It's not like the best, but it's not bad either.
8586000	8587000	Yeah.
8587000	8588000	You can buff them pretty well.
8588000	8589000	Alright.
8589000	8591000	That's my last tidbit before I go.
8591000	8594000	Hey, by the way, since I'm reading, piggybacking off of something I see in chat,
8594000	8598000	can we call you, like, can we change your name from Dark Sakura to Calamity Jamie?
8599000	8601000	I like that name.
8601000	8603000	That is pretty good.
8603000	8604000	Calamity Jamie.
8604000	8605000	That's my sub, Nick.
8608000	8609000	That's the remix edition.
8609000	8610000	Alright.
8610000	8612000	Calamity Jamie's on her way out for the night.
8612000	8614000	Have a good one. Feel better.
8614000	8617000	I'm gonna do a bunch of not talking, except when I yell at Dan for going the wrong way.
8617000	8619000	Well, try not to yell so loud.
8619000	8620000	Bye.
8620000	8621000	Alright. Bye-bye.
8621000	8624000	And last but not least tonight, before we open up the Skype line at Orange Lounge Radio,
8625000	8629000	I know a lot of you will be very excited to hear about a new Steven Universe game.
8629000	8630000	That's right.
8630000	8633000	Steven Universe Save the Light is going to be coming out this summer.
8633000	8636000	It's a sequel to Attack the Light.
8636000	8638000	This time it is Save the Light.
8638000	8642000	This time, though, the game will be out on consoles, not phones.
8642000	8644000	So Attack the Light was out on phones.
8644000	8645000	It was a mobile RPG.
8645000	8648000	This one is actually gonna be something that's available on consoles.
8648000	8651000	There'll be an updated battle system, fully customizable character selection,
8651000	8654000	more emphasis on exploration and puzzle solving in 3D environments,
8654000	8660000	and an all-new story from Rebecca Sugar and this team behind Steven Universe.
8660000	8662000	This game was shown at PAX East.
8662000	8666000	They even did a whole little panel on Saturday at 10 a.m.
8666000	8667000	However, I wasn't there.
8667000	8672000	But maybe somebody here was and wants to give us a call and talk about PAX East.
8672000	8678000	Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype, is the place to call if you'd like to give us a call and say hello.
8678000	8679000	Let's get to the Skype line.
8679000	8680000	We got a call coming in right now.
8680000	8682000	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?
8682000	8684000	It's Raginator.
8684000	8686000	Hey, Raginator, it's been a while. What's on your mind, buddy?
8686000	8688000	No, hold on.
8688000	8693000	Sorry, I wasn't able to listen live last week, but...
8693000	8698000	Well, as long as you have a permission slip, we'll excuse you this once.
8698000	8699000	Yeah.
8699000	8707000	But anyway, the reason for my call, you know, I want to bring up two things real quick.
8707000	8717000	First, although it's a little too late for both the live listeners and those that may be listening on the podcast,
8717000	8733000	I just wanted to mention that GLG just recently had their spring sale, which ended at 7 p.m. Eastern, 4 p.m. Pacific.
8733000	8735000	Well, damn it, I just did.
8735000	8747000	Yeah, they had a lot of good stuff on sale, ranging from the Ultimate Games to Mirror's Edge,
8747000	8755000	some old LucasArts point-and-click adventure games, you name it.
8756000	8764000	Their entire library was on sale, but a good chunk of it was on sale nonetheless.
8764000	8772000	Well, I'm not sure when their sale could be starting. Probably not for a while.
8773000	8783000	But as a word of advice, just keep an eye on the site and try picking up some games.
8784000	8800000	I would definitely recommend GLG over Steam, if only for the reason that for the games that are on both Steam and GOG,
8800000	8813000	9 times out of 10, the GOG version will have the nice little added bonuses of having the soundtracks included or screensavers included.
8830000	8839000	Because I bought Covert Action and some stuff on GOG, you actually got PDF manuals and stuff that's really cool.
8860000	8868000	With Indiana Jones point-and-click adventure games, The Dig, and I forget what else.
8868000	8884000	Moving on to the second part of my call. Since the talk on tonight's episode of OR has been mostly RPG heavy, I thought I would pose this question.
8884000	8901000	What RPGs did you play over the years that really made you stop and think, huh, you know what?
8901000	8917000	I never really paid attention to RPGs before, never really cared for them, but this particular game or games makes the genre look interesting. I think it may stick with this genre.
8931000	8942000	Fuck, I even played Adventure on Atari 2600 and Sword Quest, which is interesting because I didn't transition from Dungeons and Dragons as a lot of people did.
8942000	8952000	I did play a little bit of D&D in high school, a little bit but not a lot of it. It was one of those things that would happen on a weekend every other month, there would be a sleepover or something.
8952000	8973000	I always enjoyed the RPGs. There was always a real story in them that you could get into. I think that became especially true with Final Fantasy 2, which obviously is 4 as we all know it as now, but it's going to be 2 for me on the Super Nintendo.
8973000	8986000	That was really the first one where it was like, OMG, it's not just the game elements where you have that progression and you feel your character level up and you get stronger and all this stuff, but it's like, OMG, the story is so freaking good.
8986000	8996000	I think that's when I was like, oh, I'm a fan of this type of series for life. And then Final Fantasy 2 just led into things like Secret of Mana, which was also an amazing game.
8997000	9006000	Chrono Trigger, I know we get into fun banters on this show about Chrono Trigger vs. Super Metroid, but at the end of the day, Chrono Trigger is still an amazing game, and it is.
9006000	9019000	And other RPGs that we get into PlayStation. For me, it goes all the way back. RPGs never really needed a chance. I kind of get where you're going with the question, where it's kind of like, what's the RPG that really sold you on it?
9019000	9030000	But I didn't need to be sold too. Loki, JD, was it the same for you guys? Or maybe you still don't like RPGs. I don't know. Loki, what about you?
9030000	9032000	I don't like RPGs.
9032000	9035000	I know you played enough Final Fantasy 11, you gotta like RPGs.
9035000	9049000	Yeah, I mean, I don't know. I just haven't played any really great ones. I mean, aside from Skyrim. I don't really pick up a whole lot of JRPGs or anything like that right now. It's more of just more open world games.
9049000	9054000	Skyrim's kind of a weird intersect, because I like sandbox-y open world games, and I like RPGs.
9054000	9056000	And she'll have a Grand Theft Auto.
9056000	9063000	Right, and so it's just like, boom. It's just like, okay, I like that. And then Fallout 4 is kind of like, hey, it's Skyrim, but it's futuristic.
9063000	9067000	You really need this new Zelda game. You really need the new Zelda game, Loki.
9067000	9070000	I will. I'll get it this week, but I just was waiting to get paid.
9070000	9071000	I know, I know.
9071000	9074000	So once Wednesday hits, yeah, I'll pick it up.
9074000	9081000	I'm just saying, knowing as much as you love open world stuff, this new Zelda thing, you're gonna eat it up.
9081000	9083000	JD, what about you and RPGs?
9083000	9084000	I mean, my first video games-
9084000	9086000	Don't forget to get a little closer to the mic there.
9086000	9090000	My first video games were Pokemon Red and Blue, so I got started with RPGs.
9090000	9095000	But, you know, as I've gotten older, I don't have the attention span for it anymore.
9095000	9097000	Like, all of the grinding and all of the, you know, whatever.
9097000	9101000	I'm just like, they don't click the same way for me they used to.
9101000	9105000	I see. That's fair. But that's Pokemon Red and Blue.
9105000	9110000	God, especially for people of a certain age, you know, the age you're at, JD.
9110000	9113000	That was like the first game for a lot of 20-somethings.
9113000	9115000	Yeah, it wasn't at all.
9115000	9117000	Yeah, so that's a darn good point there.
9117000	9121000	What about you, RageNator, real quick? What was the first RPG for you?
9121000	9127000	You know, the funny thing is, I had the original Final Fantasy and Dragon Warrior for NES.
9127000	9135000	I think anyone that subscribed to Nintendo Power for a certain length of time got Dragon Warrior for free.
9135000	9140000	But, even with that being said, I never really cared for RPGs back then.
9140000	9142000	I thought they were a total snore.
9142000	9150000	But, in effect, my father mainly bought Final Fantasy for himself more than anything.
9150000	9154000	But, I didn't even play any RPGs on the Super Nintendo.
9154000	9163000	But, once I got myself a PlayStation 1, early on, I got myself three RPGs.
9163000	9173000	Wild Arms, trying to think of, it's made by Konami.
9173000	9174000	Suikoden.
9174000	9180000	No, not Suikoden. Something Heart, Valiant Heart, Vagrant Heart, something like that.
9180000	9181000	Vagrant Story?
9181000	9187000	No, I think Vagrant Story.
9187000	9189000	Vandal Hearts, says Ronda.
9189000	9192000	Square Enix. What I'm thinking of is by Konami.
9192000	9193000	Vandal Hearts?
9193000	9194000	Oh yeah, Vandal Hearts.
9194000	9195000	There it is.
9195000	9198000	And then, of course, obviously Final Fantasy VII.
9198000	9208000	But, those three, kind of made me say, wow, I've been such an idiot.
9208000	9212000	These games are actually fun.
9212000	9214000	I should have been playing RPGs all along, you know?
9214000	9216000	It's like me and Mass Effect.
9216000	9221000	I didn't care for it the first time, then I went back years later and I was like, wow, I was a real idiot the first time.
9221000	9229000	You know, Dark Tetsuya said something about Shadow Run, but that made me think of another, like, I would kind of consider this an RPG of a real different type on the NES.
9229000	9234000	It made me think of Shadow Gate, which was another game that really made me love.
9234000	9238000	It's a very different type of RPG. It's not like the whole RPG with hit points and everything.
9238000	9244000	Some would more consider that a point-and-click game, but I think there's a certain RPG element to it that I really love.
9244000	9247000	Anyway, Rage Nator, great question. I'm going to let you go, though, so we can get more calls.
9247000	9249000	Sure, have a nice night.
9249000	9250000	Take care, my friend.
9250000	9253000	OrangeLoungeRadio, all one word on Skype if you want to give us a call.
9253000	9260000	If you want to talk about RPGs or you want to talk about something else, you want to talk about the Nintendo Switch or maybe something else we have not addressed yet tonight, we can do that.
9260000	9265000	Let me check in with Loki to see if there's any last-minute stories we want to talk about while we wait for a call at OrangeLoungeRadio on Skype.
9265000	9267000	Sadly, no.
9267000	9268000	No?
9268000	9269000	No.
9269000	9270000	Oh.
9270000	9272000	I mean, it's a slow news week and there's no news tonight.
9272000	9278000	Yeah, it was a little slower of a news week this week, so let's see, let me go to some chat comments here.
9279000	9282000	DungeonBuster has a good point here about RPGs in 2017. DungeonBuster says,
9282000	9286000	The first few months of 2017 have been nuts with RPGs.
9286000	9296000	Tales of Berseria, Yakuza 0, Horizon Zero Dawn, Nier Automata, Torment, Tides Into Minera, and coming up are Andromeda and Persona 5.
9296000	9302000	Yeah, isn't this weird where, like, I think a lot of people are forgetting, well, probably not a lot.
9302000	9306000	I keep forgetting that Persona 5 is coming out sooner rather than later.
9307000	9309000	Because, yeah, Persona 5 is like the first week of April, right?
9309000	9313000	Was it supposed to be Valentine's Day weekend and then they, like, bumped it back a little further?
9313000	9314000	I don't remember.
9314000	9318000	I thought it was for some reason. Maybe I'm confusing it with something else.
9318000	9322000	But, yeah, Persona 5 is going to be just a few weeks away.
9322000	9324000	I think it's only, like, a week or two after Mass Effect Andromeda.
9324000	9328000	So, they, okay, Act Def confirms, yes it was, so I'm not crazy.
9328000	9330000	It was bumped back just a little bit there.
9330000	9335000	But, you know, Persona is a huge, that is, like, the RPG series for a lot of people.
9335000	9340000	So, you know, that's going to be a big, Mass Effect's a big series, Persona's a big series.
9340000	9343000	Whew! Anyway, we got another call coming in. Let's get to it.
9343000	9345000	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?
9345000	9347000	Hey, hey, hey, it's Aranma.
9347000	9349000	Hey, Aranma, how you doing?
9349000	9352000	I'm pretty good besides my usual trip to IKEA.
9352000	9356000	Slowly still getting past that whole flooding I mentioned before.
9356000	9361000	I'm now putting in new and improved bookcases to organize all my hobbies.
9362000	9367000	So, Rama, I know you called in with something else, but I have to derail for a minute because you're going to want to know about this.
9367000	9374000	I got confirmation. I will be in your area the weekend of October 13th when you're not going to be there.
9374000	9376000	God damn it!
9376000	9386000	However, Alan and I are currently trying to plan, like, do we want to go, because the ceremony is on Friday the 13th, as I suspected.
9386000	9389000	She's that type of gal who wanted her wedding on Friday the 13th.
9389000	9395000	So, we may come in, like, Tuesday, because the wedding is actually in Connecticut.
9395000	9399000	But Alan's never been to New York and has kind of wanted to see it.
9399000	9405000	So, I'm kind of like, maybe we need to fly in a few days early so we can be the big stupid tourists that go see something on Broadway and go out.
9405000	9407000	You know, it just depends how much time off work we can get.
9407000	9412000	So, I don't know when you leave for your other engagement, but either we're going to come in a few days early or we're going to stay a few days extra.
9412000	9416000	And I just have to figure out all those details, but it's still a few months away.
9416000	9421000	So, guess what, Northeast, I'm going to be back in October.
9421000	9427000	That's going to work, and it's kind of interesting you say that, because I was hanging out with one of my close friends last night.
9427000	9430000	She was actually going to get married on Friday the 13th.
9430000	9438000	It must be a trend. Maybe Alan and I will renew our vows while we're there. No, I would never try to upstage my friend.
9438000	9442000	So, because I'd get beat up.
9443000	9446000	Anyway, what did you want to call in to talk about before I derailed us?
9446000	9451000	Alright, couple things. Number one, at the top of the show, you made a mention to the movie Big.
9451000	9452000	Yes.
9452000	9456000	I don't know if you know, but F.A.O. Schwartz is no longer there.
9456000	9460000	That's right. It turned into Toys R Us for a bit, right? And now that's gone too, right?
9460000	9469000	No, no, no. The location, F.A.O. Schwartz was like much further up. It was pretty much next door to the Apple Store, the 24-hour Apple Store.
9469000	9470000	Oh.
9470000	9475000	Yeah. Due to rent, that closed. The big Toys R Us due to rent, that closed.
9475000	9479000	Oh, so they were not the same building. I got that wrong. Okay.
9479000	9485000	And also, you mentioned earlier about snow conventions and PAX East.
9485000	9488000	Brother, let me tell you a quick story.
9488000	9489000	Can't wait.
9489000	9494000	This is my first Catsacon. And I'm so hot hot hot to go, whatever.
9494000	9502000	And, you know, we do our thing. Saturday night, halfway through masquerading all of that, it starts snowing.
9502000	9511000	And I'm talking blizzard-conditioned snow. And there's signs around the convention telling people how much snow is expected and what to do.
9511000	9514000	Some people say fuck it, pack they shit, and leave that night.
9514000	9520000	They were the smart ones. The rest of us are like, you know, it's probably not going to be that bad.
9520000	9526000	They'll be shoveled in the morning. We can leave sometime Sunday. Famous last words.
9526000	9537000	Wake up that morning, we find out that Jersey has shut down, Virginia has shut down, and New York was getting close to being shut down as well.
9537000	9544000	Oh, no. Oh, no. You were trapped in a five-star hotel with copious amounts of liquor and anime geeks.
9544000	9546000	Give me a break. That was the best convention ever.
9546000	9550000	Hold up. All that liquor was gone Saturday night. I'm talking about Sunday.
9550000	9558000	All that liquor was gone on Saturday. Fair retort, sir. You win.
9558000	9566000	First thing we do is grab our stuff and we go to the CVS, and lo and behold, you know it's an anime con because all the ramen is gone.
9567000	9573000	So we're like, what the hell are we going to eat? We grab chips and cookies and soda and we're like, we will live off of that.
9573000	9578000	One of the people in our party, yes, it was like a Final Fantasy party, the four of us.
9578000	9584000	One suggested, well, why don't we go to McDonald's? We look across the street at McDonald's, even in the snow.
9584000	9588000	There are people standing outside for food. I said, no, that's okay.
9588000	9594000	Wow. So when did it end up happening? Did you end up having to stay longer or what happened?
9594000	9605000	Yes. The hotel extended the rates. They let everyone stay Sunday for free because of what was going on, and then they extended the rate for Monday.
9605000	9610000	So people were rebooking and rerooming to save a few dollars.
9610000	9622000	And what was also great was the hotel said, if we were to raise $500, they would give us two of the big rooms downstairs and make it into one so we could extend the convention.
9622000	9628000	So we kind of figured out where all the con goers were. We were knocking on their doors, sort of like Girl Scouts.
9628000	9638000	In this case, we're anime scouts, whatever, cosplay scouts, telling people, you know, we're trying to raise money so we can extend the con by one day and get food.
9638000	9649000	We end up raising about a grand and we end up getting like food platters from a supermarket up the way because it was enough snow plowed out, you know, we can get some stuff delivered.
9649000	9663000	So from like 3pm until like 1, 2 o'clock in the morning, we're downstairs in the basement of the, I believe it's the Hyatt, Regent, Hyatt Plaza, Regency, whatever hotel, which was really awesome.
9663000	9674000	We have one section that was DDR, one section was AMVs, one section was D&D buffer stores fighting this, this and that, and just platters of food. So we end up making the best of it.
9674000	9682000	That's awesome. That's a great convention story, even though, you know, it sucks about the weather, just that whole community and you killed me with anime scouts.
9682000	9685000	What's sad, though, is it's not the first time I've heard that story.
9685000	9694000	When I went to Katsucon, you kept telling me about that epic year because I think it would only been like two or three years before the year I went.
9694000	9708000	Yeah, and see, and what was happening was, now from that point on, whenever there is weather about snow when it comes to Katsucon, if it's before, which has happened, people will go down instead of Thursday, they'll go down Wednesday night to beat the storm.
9708000	9714000	Or if they hear a talk of snow on Sunday, people will leave and be like, uh-uh, not happening.
9715000	9729000	That's, that's so awesome. I love that story. That's great. So any conventions that should be on our radar coming up, Rama? You're the king of conventions here on the network with your buddies, of course, at Anime Jam Session.
9730000	9744000	Zenkai Con, that's the big convention my whole squad, we are so hyped for. It's like the really awesome down-home convention. It's a mix of anime, video games, fantasy, sci-fi, it's a little bit of everything.
9744000	9758000	One of the guests of honor is Steve Blum, as we all know, as from Cowboy Bebop. Why is his name, I'm missing his name right now, he voices on Cowboy Bebop, but we all know Steve Blum.
9758000	9760000	That is awesome.
9760000	9769000	Yeah, and he's also the main guy behind the whole voice actor strike. He's the one that kind of got it going, kind of spearheaded it.
9769000	9772000	Is that still going with the video games?
9772000	9778000	I have no idea. It probably is, but I haven't heard anything from my VA friends, so...
9778000	9793000	Will you do me a favor? Will you poke some of your VA friends and see if that strike's still going? And if it is, I want to talk to some voice actors about it, because I think a lot of gamers, you know, we kind of forgot about it during the holiday and through this console hysteria, but if there's still no resolution, that's not good.
9793000	9797000	I got you. I will do what I can. I got you on that, you know?
9797000	9803000	I appreciate it. All right. Well, my friend, I'm gonna let you go, so we wrap up the show, but thanks for the call.
9803000	9807000	Hey, you know, by the way, we say Mario, not Mario, it's Mario.
9807000	9809000	Mario's fine.
9809000	9817000	Yeah, I've never heard it pronounced any other way. It's like anime and anime and people look at you and they're like, who taught you that?
9817000	9824000	I've heard Super Mario, but I didn't necessarily pin that as a New York thing, just a wrong thing.
9824000	9825000	There you go.
9825000	9826000	All right. Take care, my friend.
9826000	9828000	You too. Stay awesome, dude.
9828000	9829000	You too. Bye.
9829000	9830000	Bye.
9830000	9835000	All right. We're gonna close up Skype for now, but if you didn't get through and you want to, you can always tweet at us, at OLR.
9835000	9840000	You can always email us, of course. Participate at Orangelaunchradio.com, but that is gonna do it for tonight's episode.
9840000	9845000	We already said good night to Dark Sakura, but we'll say good night now to our guests, JD, as well as Loki.
9845000	9849000	Let me first, of course, pimp a good, good cheer.
9849000	9852000	If you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Launch Radio, please tell a friend or two about the show.
9852000	9858000	Help us spread the word. A nice five-star review on iTunes goes an awful long way as well to help spread the word,
9858000	9862000	because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but we can only spread those voices if they're here.
9862000	9864000	So, yeah, help us spread the word.
9864000	9869000	Five-star reviews on iTunes go a long, long, long way, or wherever it is that you heard about this podcast.
9869000	9872000	JD, thanks so much for being here and sitting in the studio. Hope you had a good time tonight.
9872000	9873000	Yeah, it's always fun.
9873000	9877000	Enjoy playing more Switch. I hope to see you back here.
9877000	9879000	You said you were debating coming up for Indie Arcade, huh?
9879000	9880000	Yeah.
9880000	9884000	That'd be cool. So, sadly, Mario Kart won't be out then yet, but we'll hopefully have some more Switch games to play.
9884000	9885000	Right.
9885000	9887000	Exactly. Any final thoughts for listeners tonight?
9887000	9889000	Um, not really.
9889000	9893000	Not really. All right. Just, you know, take care of each other, I guess. Don't be mean.
9893000	9899000	All right. Thank you, JD. Loki, here we are at the end of our 679th episode.
9899000	9902000	Good luck. I hope you're able to get Zelda this week. Hope Pay Day's good to you.
9902000	9903000	Okay.
9903000	9905000	All right. Any final thoughts for listeners tonight?
9905000	9912000	No. It's funny. I'm working. I've been doing game programming all week. Sadly, it's probably not something you'll ever see.
9912000	9914000	Well, no.
9914000	9916000	It's not always the case, Loki?
9916000	9920000	No, no, no. It's a work-related project, so that's why it's...
9920000	9923000	All right. So, when you get paid to do it, then you actually do it.
9923000	9927000	No, it's more for a presentation, but my presentation looks fucking awesome.
9927000	9931000	All right. All right. That's going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
9931000	9936000	Thank you guys so much for listening. My final thought tonight? Pizza. Mmm. Delicious.
9936000	9940000	Have a good week, everybody. We'll see you back here in seven days to do it all over again.
9940000	9947000	Thanks for your support. It means the world. In the meantime, enjoy your Switch or your PlayStation 4 or whatever it is you happen to be playing.
