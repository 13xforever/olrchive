This week, Harmonix officially announces its next release, DropMix, allows anyone to bring out their inner mashup artist and create the amalgamation they always wanted. This is just one of tonight's stories, so stay tuned for so much more, starting right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.

Orange Lounge Radio

3
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio. Live tonight, episode number 679 of our show for this March the 12th of 2017.

4
00:00:46,000 --> 00:01:02,000
My name is Rob Roberts, joining you live from Studio N7 in Sacramento, California, where we're live every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com, 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show. I hope you all made it back here with the time change.

5
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I also hate that whole losing an hour of sleep with daylight savings time as much as the rest of you do, but I'm not going to lie, the hour of daylight is nice. It is still light in the OLR studio.

6
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I've just taken one hour of your life. How does it feel?

7
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Surprisingly, Dark Sakura has not turned to ash with all the daylight in the studio.

8
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:33,000
You want to know what's funny? I even drove with the windows down and the sun blaring on my freshly washed purple hair and listening to Lady Gaga. I still have perfect illusion in my head because I was singing with it.

9
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Sure, sure. Get on with your bad self.

10
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
With what voice I have because I actually have enough voice to attempt to sing today.

11
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I know you're still kind of plagueish, but you sound just fine. You sound recovered even though I know you're still having treatment for that sinus infection from hell or whatever it is you've been going through.

12
00:01:51,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I still hurt, but I'm feeling remarkably better. My voice just wears out still quickly, so I've been preserving my voice, drinking warm things, and apparently I have a legit Stroopwafel, which I freaking love legit Stroopwafels.

13
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Yes, our guest tonight actually brought Stroopwafel to the show, and this is hilarious. So I was talking about it on Twitter, and I got followed by the official, or I don't know if it's official or whatever, it's some redistributor of all these Stroopwafel products.

14
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I mean, they're overseas, so it costs an arm and a leg to actually have them sent over here. But yeah, it's just funny, which by the way, we're going to get to an email.

15
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,000
We're going to get to an email tonight that may blow your mind. We may have been saying Stroopwafel wrong this whole time.

16
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Stroopwafel?

17
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Yeah, we're going to get to that later in the email segment, so we'll get to that later.

18
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
But it's Stroopwafel.

19
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:47,000
We'll see, we'll see. I'll leave you with that teaser. Anyway, this episode of OLR is brought to you by The Dark. Also, we're sitting in the dark tonight. We don't have our usual light on because it's kind of warm in here.

20
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
It's 76 degrees outside.

21
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Yeah. When did summer show up? Like we went from like three weeks of nonstop rain where I thought we would have to build an arc in order to do OLR and then suddenly it's like, hi, summer showed up.

22
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
So anyway, but global warming, not a thing. Just so you know, Dark Sakura. Anyway.

23
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I will say this.

24
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
What? Then I got to introduce the other guy.

25
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:13,000
And eating the Stroopwafel. Sweet things still taste like soap to me. However, the aftertaste is delicious Stroopwafel.

26
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
There you go.

27
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:29,000
So I am quite pleased that yes, I do have a very large amount of dove taste in my mouth and not the delicious pigeon type bird that people would eat in the Victorian era when they were poor.

28
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
But it is delicious and the texture is amazing. I love Stroopwafel.

29
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I'm being yelled at by chatters. Hi, chat over in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com. Again, Sunday nights live after Bobby Blackwolf at the Voicegeeks Network, vognetwork.com.

30
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Rama in chat says, fuck your summer weather. We got a nor'easter blowing down my door. Yeah, I heard. Meanwhile, while we're trying to deal with the heat, like they're saying like 18 inches of snow, which I guess is a lot.

31
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I mean, like you just put flakes here in California and works and schools close everywhere. But 18 inches of snow, I guess in the middle of, I hope I'm getting that right, in the middle of New York.

32
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Which sounds right, though, because I remember a couple years ago was when I went to PAX East, right? And PAX East was this weekend, right?

33
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:28,000
And there was still like Boston was having their hell snowmageddon thing going on, which is probably every year. But this was like bigger than most the last time I was at PAX East. So this still this still sounds right to me. Anyway.

34
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:43,000
In mobile, yeah, one year. I mean, it will snow like every so often, like an inch. But people treat it like it's a freaking hurricane. Actually, they treat it worse than it's a hurricane. You can find no bread in the store. You have to live on hot dog buns.

35
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:55,000
All right. Well, look here to rock you like a hurricane. Say hello to Techmaster Loki. Hello. Hi, Loki. How are you? I'm fine. Yeah, good. Good. You didn't bring food to the show tonight. I was shocked. I was like, what's going on here?

36
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:11,000
That's because I diet. No, I know I was making Irish stew. So I had just finished cooking at about five. So I just didn't have time to like I was cooking it for a while. So I was like, I'm just gonna cook.

37
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Yeah, I do that all the time. Nice. I Irish stew. Does that mean lots of bacon and Guinness and Irish stew? It's just potatoes and carrots. And you can put Guinness in the. No, no, no.

38
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:35,000
When I made it, we did Guinness in the broth. He probably wants his kid. I mean, I guess alcohol cooks out, but he still probably wants. No, it's not like a beer broths, you know, stew or anything. That's just straight up, you know, onions, carrots.

39
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:46,000
And I usually put like celery in there as well. And garlic, even though it doesn't call for garlic crock pot, you got to get one more crock pot meal in before winter's officially over. Basically, it was a crock pot on the stove.

40
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:59,000
So did that. And then, of course, on top of that, we recommend it is that you also make an a herb butter that you can pour over the potatoes. So I poured that over. It was fucking. You should you should have a cooking show on YouTube.

41
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I think you would know, I would think people out there would not guess that Loki like cooks like this. And you would I think you do very well with the cooking show recipes.

42
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Except I didn't measure anything. Cooking with Loki. It's not that hard. It's not just follow the recipes. God. That would be the show is that Loki is having to supervise someone else cooking and Loki just gets very angry like follow the recipe.

43
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
That would be a lot of fun.

44
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,000
You know that there is a channel that's cooking with Cooking Mama.

45
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Really?

46
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Yeah. And that's actually what gave me the inspiration that to make pizza because I watched him make pizza and it looked actually kind of good. So I made pizza.

47
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Is that a is that a Twitch thing?

48
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
No, it's on YouTube.

49
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,000
OK, because I know Twitch has the whole cooking section now, too, or at least eating. If they have eating, they surely have cooking.

50
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I think you should do. Well, I can make a channel based on that. That's easy.

51
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
There you go. There you go.

52
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
It'll be entitled like each episode. Special K again.

53
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
OK.

54
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Some days I don't want to make anything.

55
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I think you should do something like the walk with Jan where you have like an apron that's got a different like bacon pun on it.

56
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
But his raw like walk puns like walk on the wild side.

57
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I like it. Do you remember that show?

58
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
It's long.

59
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Jan can cook that one? Yeah, Jan can cook.

60
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

61
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Maybe it was called something else, but it was like Martin Yan was his name.

62
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Yeah, he's got a he had a few different shows on PBS. I only remember Yan can cook, but he had other ones.

63
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
He also had like a restaurant, I thought, or like a chain of restaurants or something.

64
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I never saw more Food Network in my life than the years I lived with Loki.

65
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I said my mom, the Martin Yan cookbook.

66
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Of course, Food Network game works. You don't have cable, but you know.

67
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Well, these are the pre Netflix days, too.

68
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
So, you know, it was Food Network and Chill.

69
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
It wasn't Netflix and Chill.

70
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
It was like Food Network can get hungry.

71
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
All right, I got to introduce our guest here tonight.

72
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Oh, very, very familiar voice on the show.

73
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
It's been probably been at least a month or two since we've heard from him.

74
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
But welcome back to the show tonight, JD.

75
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Hi.

76
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Hi, JD. How are you doing?

77
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I'm pretty good.

78
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Yeah, good. Good to have you back. How are you doing?

79
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Don't forget to get that microphone nice and close so we can hear you.

80
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Otherwise, it's a struggle.

81
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I'm doing pretty well.

82
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I appreciate that.

83
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Great. I'm glad you like him.

84
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
So JD actually didn't bring the Stroopwafel with him.

85
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
He had it shipped here from. Did you get it on Amazon?

86
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I got it on Amazon.

87
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:31,000
So which is funny because that's not the first time in 2017 Stroopwafel has magically shown up at my doorstep.

88
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Not that this is a trend I'm upset with at all.

89
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I mean, like, you know, we don't beg for donations or T-shirt sales or anything like that here on OLR.

90
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I mean, we really should, but we don't.

91
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
But if you want to pay us a Stroopwafel, I really can't complain.

92
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:55,000
So, I mean, cool. But so this box shows up on my doorstep, but it has my stage name on it because you all know Rob Roberts is my real name, but it's just the name I've had online for years and years.

93
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:03,000
So it has my stage name on it. And I'm like, okay, somebody sent something to the house that knows my address, but doesn't know my real name.

94
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:09,000
And so I opened it up and I, you know, first, you know, Alan's like, well, is it ticking?

95
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,000
No, it's not. So I went ahead and opened it up and I saw what it was, but there was no packing slip.

96
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
There was nothing in there besides the Stroopwafel to let me know who sent it.

97
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I just forgot to mark it as a gift because I assumed that Amazon would say who it was from.

98
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:29,000
So no, it didn't. So I had to like write this tweet, like, well, thanks for whoever sent the Stroopwafel.

99
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I have no idea who you are. And then when you showed up, you were like, oh yeah, it was me.

100
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
For all I know, you're just taking credit for it. No, I'm kidding. I'm kidding.

101
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Well, I know you're a man of your wood.

102
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I know you're a man of your wood. You have the receipts. Good, good.

103
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
So what's new with you?

104
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Not a whole lot.

105
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Any adventures to arcades lately? You told me, since it is a video game show, we should get off food and get on video games for a minute.

106
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
You've been traveling around to Bay Area arcades, right?

107
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Yeah, so Dave and Buster's recently opened up, maybe like just in the next city south of me.

108
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,000
So I've been going there fairly regularly and they have the latest DDR version, Ace.

109
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,000
So I got myself an EMU's card and I've been tracking scores and it's been fun.

110
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Yeah, but they don't really have any other music based games.

111
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
They have grand piano keys.

112
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
That's the ticket spinning game? I rule at that game. I love grand piano keys.

113
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:26,000
When they first set it up, it was right next to the DDR machine, so the two of them are almost competing because two music games next to each other is a problem sometimes.

114
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
But then they moved it the next time I was there and now it's a giant Pac-Man.

115
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I feel like my whole life playing Beatmania type games prepared me to win a lot of tickets and grand piano keys.

116
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:46,000
If you haven't seen grand piano keys, you guys, it's this giant oversized piano that you would imagine a 7-year-old would just go crazy banging on the keys because it's like this gigantic keyboard.

117
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
And they do, and so forth. But you're supposed to follow the notes on the screen.

118
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Well, you know what? It's also fun to be a 38-year-old banging on these gigantic keys.

119
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,000
It's really relaxing. You can go at your own tempo. The key to doing it is...

120
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
No, you gotta go fast. Gotta go fast.

121
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Well, that's what I mean.

122
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Do you want tickets?

123
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,000
You know, you have to read the notes and stuff, but it's not like a timing game like most of the music games that we play.

124
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Akuma JP says, like, the big movie. No, but it's not one with your feet. See, when you think of big, you think of the one with your feet.

125
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:23,000
This one's more elevated, like you're sitting at a piano bench. It's a lovely concert you're going to and you sit at the piano bench.

126
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
But would you say that the keys are comically large?

127
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Yeah, there's only four of them and it's huge.

128
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Hilariously large.

129
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
So, yes. Yeah, there's only like four keys on the keyboard.

130
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Four keys per player.

131
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Oh, well that's just easy. You just need two doubles, right?

132
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I know, right? Yeah.

133
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Come on, I grew up on seven keys.

134
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Four?

135
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
This thing dropped it down to four. This is for babies.

136
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
If they had a doubles, I would be playing it.

137
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I know, they need the doubles mode. It'd be awesome.

138
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Anyway, I'm glad to hear you're having fun still touring the arcades in the Bay Area.

139
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I have to check out this Dave & Buster's that's new.

140
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I always only knew the one in Milpitas as far as Bay Area is concerned.

141
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
And then they built the one here in Roseville, which is sad.

142
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
It's a sad Dave & Buster's. It's small.

143
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,000
You can go to the Dave & Buster's because it's in Daly City and then you can go to the Steak & Shake, which is almost next door.

144
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Fuck yes, that's great. Steak & Shake is still a novelty to us here in California.

145
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
That Daly City one is the first one in California, right?

146
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I haven't had Steak & Shake, but I like Steak and I like Shake.

147
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
It's all about the banana chocolate combo.

148
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,000
It's also, temper your expectations, it's not actual steak. It's a steak burger.

149
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Steak burger, yeah. I'm fine with steak burger.

150
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
But they're good and they have amazing onion rings.

151
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I go there for Chili Mac.

152
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
God, food with you people all the fucking time.

153
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
We gotta get into video games because that's what we're here to talk about.

154
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Video games, gamer culture, and the gamer lifestyle every Sunday night live with you guys at vognetwork.com.

155
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Kick off topic tonight, start things off.

156
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I want to talk a little bit about a company that's been in the news a lot this week.

157
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:00,000
A lot. And this is something that's really been shifting gaming culture quite a bit over the years.

158
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
And that is Twitch.

159
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I don't know if you guys realize, Twitch has been in the news a lot this week.

160
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,000
So last week we talked about the whole fact that they were going to start selling games.

161
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
That was a big shift for Twitch.

162
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
But it's also, it's totally logical.

163
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:23,000
And even though we kind of, I voiced my concern with the system is that only these larger streamers are getting rewarded.

164
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
The smaller streamers aren't.

165
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I do still feel like there's time for Twitch to kind of hear all that and process that.

166
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
And we'll see what ultimately comes of that.

167
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I'm not taking any of that as like the final word.

168
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
But then there was a lot more that came out on Twitch this week.

169
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:43,000
For example, I'm going to start with something a little more negative because this is really unfortunate.

170
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:49,000
But you guys may have heard of the marathon streamer who is streaming on Twitch who passed away in the middle of his stream.

171
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,000
He was 22 hours into his 24 hour charity stream and he passed away.

172
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
And I'm not here to joke or make light of that situation.

173
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
It's really awful.

174
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:06,000
But the unfortunate thing is the way we kind of obsess with media or what have you, this type of news information gains a lot of speed.

175
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:13,000
And it gets a lot of re-blogs and so forth that like, OMG this guy passed away while he was doing a marathon.

176
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Well it kind of, it also kind of blows the situation out of proportion because my understanding is the guy had stepped away to have a cigarette.

177
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,000
And that's when he passed out and ultimately passed away.

178
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:32,000
And I apologize, I don't have the source in front of me, but I think it was heart related complications probably from staying up for so long.

179
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:39,000
And potentially, I don't know, but potentially having just pre-existing health things that maybe were coming into play here.

180
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:44,000
And I'm thinking if he stepped away to have a cigarette, he probably felt something was coming on.

181
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:50,000
So my point is, thank God it didn't happen on camera because people are sick and you know, but anyway.

182
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
So despite the fact that that's not such a good thing, it's a very bad thing.

183
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:03,000
It's gaining a lot of traction and clicks and people are realizing like wow, a lot of people watch this Twitch stuff that happens live.

184
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
And they are there to watch the unexpected moments.

185
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Obviously that is not an unexpected moment you're tuning in for, but you know, just the, on a lighter note, the sillier things that happen, the unexpected moment.

186
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Which, this didn't happen on Twitch per se, but a perfect example of something that very well could have happened on Twitch was that guy that was on the BBC or something doing a live interview.

187
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
And then his kid comes in through the door and you know, is like crashing the interview, right?

188
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
That video is everywhere this week, right? Because people like to see when things go wrong.

189
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
And that kind of stuff happens on Twitch like all the time, right?

190
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
That whole type of thing.

191
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Anyway, this is causing Twitch to show up in the mass media, like NPR did a whole little feature on Twitch this week, you know.

192
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:56,000
And even though I think we as gamers and folks that consume gaming media on the regular, we're all very familiar with Twitch.

193
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Well, let me ask this. How much do you watch Twitch or other, when I say Twitch, my umbrella that encompasses Beam, YouTube, Live, and the other stuff too.

194
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,000
How much do you do the streaming? Yes. How much do you watch that stuff? Dark Soccer, do you watch that stuff?

195
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Not at all.

196
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Really?

197
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
No, not really.

198
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
But you guys do YouTubes, don't you?

199
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
No, but I'm going to be starting it up. Dan and I are talking about basically just recording us arguing while playing games.

200
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Well, people said they'd listen to it, so whatever. I've streamed though.

201
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Yeah.

202
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:37,000
I'll pick a game that I'm like, okay, this game is WTF worthy. Like, I did the entirety of Hot to Full Boyfriend.

203
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:43,000
And now, yes, I dated Pigeons and played the final scenario.

204
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Oh, I have all the achievements.

205
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Took four hours. Oh my god, but it was great and fucked up.

206
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
I wanted a sequel.

207
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Well, there's the other ones. There's Holiday Star, and then there's a couple others, which I have now, and I'm planning on doing Holiday Star next.

208
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:03,000
So I will stream, but sometimes it's kind of boring for me to watch other people's streams.

209
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:11,000
And I don't like to listen to people talk over games. It's just annoying to me. I would rather enjoy the game.

210
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,000
So I will look for long plays on YouTube instead.

211
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Ah, okay.

212
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Unless it's like, play along with me, and then they want your input.

213
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,000
And some people like having you talk to them. I guess that's okay.

214
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:33,000
When I stream, I talk and I interact with the listeners, but I'll tell you my pet peeve. This is what I don't do.

215
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
My pet peeve is reading dialogue boxes in silly voices.

216
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Yeah, that's annoying.

217
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,000
But however, I'm not shading you if you do do that because I know other people that love that.

218
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
I know other people that love that.

219
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
I just, I don't.

220
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:54,000
I think Markiplier is annoying. He is, you know, maybe an okay person.

221
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:00,000
He's got a nice voice. I loved his Five Nights at Freddy's one because those were meant to be entertaining.

222
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
But I don't really like many of his other videos, and I don't find them really that funny.

223
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
I've only seen one video of his. I don't know the guy to be able to say anything positive or negative.

224
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
If he's doing charity streams, then that's positive.

225
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Yeah, I'm okay with charity.

226
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:23,000
So, but like, the ones that I think are really entertaining are the ones that add something to the game.

227
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:29,000
You know, ones that are an interactive element but not overshadowing the game.

228
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,000
It's not necessarily about the player. You are a part of the experience.

229
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
And they are there to bring you into the experience in a way you wouldn't normally be.

230
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:44,000
So that is kind of where I am about those streams. I don't know if I'm the only person in this room that feels that way.

231
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:54,000
I don't really watch Twitch, although more recently I have been watching a little bit of it just because of my day job, which is ironic.

232
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
But I haven't even really watched too much of that.

233
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Preferably, I normally watch stuff on YouTube, but not even live stuff. It's more rebroadcast.

234
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:11,000
The most you'll see me watching actual streams would be kind of like, Awesome Games Done Quick rebroadcasts, or the archives of those.

235
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:23,000
So I'll watch those occasionally, and I'll watch like, occasionally, I forget the guy's actual name, but he goes by CarlSagan42 on YouTube.

236
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:31,000
He does a lot of the very technical Mario Maker levels. He also speedruns Mario games and stuff like that.

237
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:39,000
So I don't remember the guy's actual name though. But I watch him. He's pretty entertaining. Although I haven't been watching him pretty lately.

238
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
But, I don't know.

239
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:51,000
I like those things too. When it adds to the experience of the game. Like, when they're explaining what they're doing in a speedrun, or like you're doing talking about the technical aspects of it.

240
00:19:51,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Well it's great because he'll play through the levels, and then at the very end when he's like, he'll figure, like you're kind of watching with him and he's figuring it all out, then he'll just break the world record for it.

241
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Because that's what he doesn't. Like he just speedruns the solely technical level and gets the world record for each one of them. Just kind of funny.

242
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:16,000
I guess I must watch much more of the livestream stuff than you do. I find, you know, I probably watch more of it at this point than I do Netflix, to be honest.

243
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Like, you know, especially if I'm just kind of bored and hanging out on the couch, I'll fire up the Playstation 4. Especially if friends of mine are broadcasting. I'm ten times more likely to watch, like if a friend of mine is live, I'll just go tune into the stream.

244
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Because it's kind of like you're hanging out with a friend long distance, right? That's kind of what this show is in a way.

245
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:42,000
I would love to do more streaming if it wasn't going to totally annoy my wife because, you know, I'd be talking and so it'd be interrupting whatever she's doing.

246
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:47,000
But if I had my own room that was soundproof that I could actually do that, then hell yeah I'd do that.

247
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
We need the Nelly commentary Twitch channel.

248
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
No we don't. Actually, I don't think we do.

249
00:20:54,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Well, obviously I enjoy doing the livestreaming more and more, but I've been watching more and more too and I actually have been dipping in more and more often to strangers and people that I don't recognize.

250
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Just because none of my friends are streaming and so I just want to watch somebody play Overwatch or something and maybe it's somebody, sometimes I even watch streams that aren't in English.

251
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Like just to kind of hear the voiceovers and dubs in another language and just to hear and just kind of see competition around the world I think is really interesting to me.

252
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:31,000
So I've been watching more of it than I was probably a few years ago. In fact, I would think I probably was one of the people in the very beginning that was like,

253
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:38,000
who wants to watch somebody else play a video game? I'm sure you can probably go back to old OLRs and hear me saying that, but opinions evolve, they change.

254
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:44,000
As more and more people get in there and do things with it, you start to see the other sides of it at the end of the day.

255
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
So I think I came full circle and I really became a fan of the whole thing.

256
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:58,000
But it's just interesting how much more mainstream stuff that now Twitch is starting to get with, they have this whole NPR thing as well.

257
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Sorry, I'm reading in chat over at live.vognetwork.com. Dungeonbuster in chat says it's hard though, not all streamers are as entertaining to me, but their gameplay can also be great background noise, especially if they're playing something obscure.

258
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Bobby Blackwolf in chat, who you might remember, used to host a show called Friday Night Gaming that was, in a way, really ahead of its time because that show was playing live video games and doing the show over it, but this was before Twitch had really taken off.

259
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,000
I think Justin TV was still on, but Twitch hadn't really taken off yet.

260
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:36,000
So Blackwolf says, I got told that all the time, that's why Friday Night Gaming got cancelled. Nobody wanted to watch other people play video games on the internet on a Friday night.

261
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:41,000
The store didn't want anything to do with it, nobody wanted to be the one playing, and only a couple dozen people watched online.

262
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:49,000
So it's like it was one of those things where it was an idea ahead of its time, and I'm not sure what finally made that take off.

263
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:59,000
I don't know, I don't know if it just became, as Bobby you were kind of mentioning as you scrolled up, you only need a quarter of the software today than you needed back then.

264
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Maybe the technology and the fact that it's so easy for anyone to do so that it can be instead of strange people that I don't know on the internet at all doing it, it's like my friends and people that I know from great distances are doing it, maybe that helped break down the walls.

265
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Well yeah, and also the equipment, because before you used to have to have a capture card and all the software and a PC running set up to do all the streaming and everything, and now these consoles have it built in.

266
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
That's very true, some of them.

267
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Well all the modern consoles do.

268
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
The Switch doesn't yet.

269
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Like I said, all the modern consoles do.

270
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:44,000
But it's very easy to set up the Switch on streaming, I'm going to stream on the Nintendo Switch after tonight's show, so it's not impossible to do. Getting the Wii U set up was harder, honestly.

271
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
I have to completely derail us for a second.

272
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Uh oh.

273
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:56,000
I went looking on eBay for a game that I wanted my collection, and I found something. I linked it to you. I linked it in the chat room.

274
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
What is this?

275
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Who's got $79,000 handy?

276
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,000
$79,000? What is it? Is it a sealed copy of Stadium Events or something?

277
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Uh, it might be included.

278
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Okay, what is this? So on eBay, massive huge video game mega collection, 122 console systems, plus 3 coin ops. What the heck?

279
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
60 peripherals and 3 coin ops.

280
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Somebody's cleaning house. Okay, but it's being sold out of Italy.

281
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Yeah, but still.

282
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
That's going to be way too much shipping.

283
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
50 bucks. But still.

284
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:33,000
I mean, if you have $79,000, 50 bucks of shipping isn't going to make that much of a difference.

285
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Jeez Louise.

286
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Yeah, I figured that was worth a momentary derailment for. I maybe have half of that, and the other systems in there are a lot of European systems, too.

287
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Boy, I wonder why somebody would completely gut their collection like that, or maybe it's a game store that's gone under.

288
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Oh, there are multiples? It actually looks like it was a library. They have an XI there.

289
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,000
If you wanted to start some retro game store, though, here's all you need to get started.

290
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:09,000
It looks like a few special edition systems to Japanese Saturn and American Saturn. Yeah, there are multiple versions of the system, just different iterations of it.

291
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Including a DDR second mix for Dreamcast, which I have.

292
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:20,000
You'd be set to stream for life if you bought this thing. But anyway, back to streaming for a minute.

293
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,000
No, that's okay. JD, what's your take on streaming? Do you participate with it?

294
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:33,000
I haven't really gotten into it. Mostly, I mean, I don't find myself with all that much free time sometimes, and usually I'm like, well, if I have time, I could be playing games or I could be watching them.

295
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,000
And I usually just fall on the side of playing them, because I have so many games in my backlog.

296
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:49,000
I guess I didn't realize I was the only one that was really participating in that stuff on the regular. Well, something might bring you guys into the fold soon enough. Who knows?

297
00:25:49,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Anyway, something else that Twitch has launched somewhat recently is Twitch IRL, which the NPR article also got into was talking about how now people stream real life stuff on Twitch, which is hilarious.

298
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Because, of course, those of us that were around when Justin.TV was around saw this go the other way, that Justin.TV was set up to be an IRL thing, that then the video game section really took off and Twitch kind of dominated the conversation.

299
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:26,000
They ended up essentially closing Justin.TV, although I know when they first launched IRL, they really tried to set out, here's the differences between the two, but come on, it's still kind of funny in a way to see the IRL lead to Twitch lead back to IRL.

300
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:31,000
I just thought that was interesting. Well, anyhow, there's still other news about Twitch and what's going on.

301
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Twitch also streams IRL programs. Like, they had the Bob Ross thing not that long ago, right? And that was awesome. Did you guys not watch the Bob Ross thing?

302
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
I did not watch the Bob Ross, but it sounded awesome.

303
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
I used to watch Bob Ross when he was on PBS, so I've probably seen them all.

304
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
I watch Bob Ross on Netflix nowadays.

305
00:26:50,000 --> 00:27:02,000
But it's something else to say, you know, like when Bob Ross is going, I'm going to beat the devil out of that brush, I'm just going to beat the devil out of that brush, to see the chat light up going, devil wrecked, RIP devil, devil get fucked, you know, all this stuff.

306
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,000
You know, because along the nice things that Bob Ross does.

307
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Well, Twitch is going to be hosting, get this, a 17-day marathon of the Power Rangers. Is Shane out there from Ranger Pride?

308
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Surely, and he watches more streaming than I do. I'm sure he's aware of this and Captain Spike over there at Ranger Pride, but they're going to be doing a 17-day marathon of the Power Rangers.

309
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:32,000
It's going to start on March 15th, run through the 30th, 23 seasons and 831 episodes of 19 different television series.

310
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:40,000
The whole thing, I think, is supposed to be a lead up into the movie, of course, which they're, aren't there like Krispy Kreme Power Rangers donuts at this point?

311
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Like, they're really trying to get the marketing out there for the Power Rangers.

312
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
So the movie was already out.

313
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,000
The 24th is when the movie, there's like a new movie, are you aware?

314
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Yeah, the new live action one, but I thought that came out back in January.

315
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:57,000
No, trailer did, but the movie's finally going to be here just a couple weeks, so that's a pretty big deal.

316
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:03,000
So yeah, that is something you can check out there. That's going to be on the Twitch Presents channel.

317
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:11,000
That's going to be part of Twitch's monthly subscription offering, but if you're an Amazon Prime person, which a lot of you are, you're going to just have that built in.

318
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:17,000
So, let's see, going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com, Bobby Blackwolf says,

319
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:24,000
The Bob Ross chat room was the only time I enjoyed watching Twitch chat just because I thought the spamming was hilarious.

320
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Yeah, during that Bob Ross thing, it was hilarious. There is a lot of toxic stuff that happens sometimes in Twitch chat.

321
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:36,000
For example, chicken in chat says more like racist ranges.

322
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:44,000
But I gotta say, I was actually, I was just watching Twitch over the weekend, actually.

323
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:52,000
And I was watching a streamer I was not familiar with at all, and I don't even remember his name, but I know he was overseas because he had an accent, and he was playing Overwatch.

324
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:59,000
And somebody, I didn't watch, I wasn't watching the chat, but somebody I think was acting up in his chat and saying like nasty things.

325
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:05,000
But I thought it was really cool that this dude bro-ish guy shut it down.

326
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Like he said, come on dude, that's not cool, don't say that kind of stuff or you can't hang out here.

327
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:19,000
I want this to be a positive place. And I was like, is this the internet that I know? Is this the Twitter view?

328
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:25,000
So, I have to applaud people on Twitch that don't put up with that shit.

329
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:35,000
And if you don't make a space for it and you let them know that that type of racist shit is not welcome here, then I think that's awesome that people are doing that.

330
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:46,000
And that just helps Twitch in the long run to get that bullshit out of their community, which is why a lot of people, not to get too off topic, but it's why a lot of people are still very frustrated with Twitter.

331
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Because Twitter doesn't really take that same type of action against people that it probably needs to take action against.

332
00:29:55,000 --> 00:30:03,000
I digress. Anyway, let's see. Dungeon Buster says, was it Flame Hopper? He's like a super positive streamer that plays H1Z1.

333
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:08,000
I honest to God don't remember the guy's name, but he was playing Overwatch and I think he plays Overwatch a lot.

334
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:15,000
I think that's like his bread and butter is that. Because he kept talking about how he usually streams competitive mode, but this particular day he wasn't.

335
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,000
He was streaming just quick plays. So, I thought that was really cool.

336
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Anyway, so as if all that was enough, that's not the rest of the news. So, there's more stuff that Twitch was doing into this week.

337
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:34,000
So, Twitch is going to be launching, funny enough as I just said that Twitter can't seem to take a lot of the garbage out of it.

338
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:43,000
Twitch is going to launch a type of Twitter competitor. It's called Pulse. It's going to be a feed that updates photos, images, text from Twitch users.

339
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:50,000
Which essentially is going to be for people probably plugging their upcoming streams or maybe discussing gaming and so forth.

340
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,000
But it's going to be interesting to see how this IRL spin is going to be on it.

341
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,000
I don't think everybody is in Pulse yet. I think it's something they're slowly rolling out to people.

342
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:04,000
But it definitely seems like Twitch wants to go for some of that Facebook or Twitter money.

343
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:10,000
What do you guys think about Twitch trying to get into that whole social feed element?

344
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
How long before they duplicate Snapchat?

345
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Yeah, how long before they duplicate, right? No, that's Facebook that keeps ripping off Snapchat at every angle.

346
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:22,000
Loki, do you think Twitch has an opportunity to take a bite out of Twitter and Facebook and all that?

347
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
They can definitely try.

348
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:31,000
Tigerclaw points out in chat, I believe Twitch has an automod thing to help moderate the chat. That is true.

349
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:36,000
You can choose how strong or soft you want that automod to be.

350
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:42,000
But you're right, I forgot about that. There is an automod system on there that is on, I think, a medium level by default.

351
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:49,000
So to get rid of the most garbage comments, but if you still want to have a little rough chat, you can have it.

352
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:55,000
Also, then there's Pulse, which we'll see what impact that has as it starts to roll out more.

353
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:01,000
And then, if you guys forgot, Twitch picked up Curse not that long ago.

354
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Which, if you've played World of Warcraft in the past, you're probably aware of Curse because they did a lot of automods.

355
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Darkstalker, do you use any of the Curse stuff to install your mods, or do you do it all by hand?

356
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Yeah, I use Curse for all of my mods.

357
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Well, I don't know if you know, but that's Twitch program now.

358
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,000
Yeah, I know.

359
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
So, coming out very soon, a rebranding of Curse, it's going to be...

360
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
They've already replaced the app.

361
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,000
Oh, have they replaced it with all their branding?

362
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,000
Yeah, they've already replaced it with all of the Twitch stuff, and honestly, it works far better than it did before.

363
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
Instead of having to pay for Curse Premium, it just works.

364
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:34,000
The official launch of the Twitch desktop app is going to be March 16th.

365
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:40,000
And so, now you hear this whole Twitch is trying to get into buying and selling the games directly.

366
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
Twitch is getting into trying to replace Facebook.

367
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:48,000
Twitch is already on the desktops of most World of Warcraft players, which is one of the biggest PC games out there.

368
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:54,000
You really start to see how Twitch is trying to get a lot more than just, come watch what we're doing.

369
00:32:54,000 --> 00:33:00,000
Out of curiosity, Dark Soccer, since I haven't played WoW in a while, and Fallout SE 14 doesn't support add-ons, so Curse doesn't really use it,

370
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:04,000
does this Twitch app now try to encourage you to watch live feeds while you're on it too?

371
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,000
No.

372
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Oh, interesting. I bet it will. It's going to be interesting if that's coming.

373
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,000
I just always keep up the add-on manager, so I never see it.

374
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:19,000
Interesting. Bobby Blackwolf in chat points out the Twitch desktop is going after Discord with that Apple.

375
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
It seems like everybody wants a piece of Slack right now.

376
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
Discord's freaking annoying.

377
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:29,000
Everybody wants a piece of that Slack right now. It's not just Discord, but it's Slack.

378
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Google split Hangouts this week, right? Or they're going to be.

379
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Hangouts is going to have their whole video component, but then their text component is basically going to be Google Slack.

380
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:45,000
Microsoft's got a Slack competitor they're working on as well. That's the whole new thing.

381
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Slack is basically the IRC thing that you guys are participating with at live.vog.net.com.

382
00:33:53,000 --> 00:34:01,000
Slack is just a modern version of IRC that has more support for when you paste in a link, it automatically shows you what the preview is.

383
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,000
You can insert photos in natively. It's a more modern version of IRC.

384
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:11,000
I'm in some ways kind of surprised. We here at VOG haven't tried to.

385
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:17,000
Well, actually, somebody asked me about that point blank once. Why haven't we tried to go to something like Slack?

386
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:23,000
A, that costs money. B, it's also harder to integrate. Something like Slack, you have to invite people to.

387
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:30,000
The nice thing about live.vog.net.com, it's built right into that page. You go, you sign in, you can use it.

388
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:35,000
If you misbehave, Bobby Banhammer Blackwolf will make sure you don't get to get in there again.

389
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:42,000
But it's built into the website very easy to get into. Where as Slack and Discord even, you kind of have to invite people.

390
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
Well, Discord has links.

391
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:51,000
But again, it's not really something that's built into websites, but I don't know.

392
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:59,000
With Slack, it's built with the workplace paradigm, so you have to trust everyone you invite. There's no abuse controls, so it can get out of hand a lot easier.

393
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:06,000
Yeah. Interesting. Bobby's perspective over at live.vog.net.com. Slack was started as the chat engine for an MMO.

394
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:15,000
The MMO died, but they learned the chat engine was marketable. Yeah. Or even IRC. I mean, do a lot of people still use IRC?

395
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:22,000
I think so. I think IRC is still popular with a lot of, especially more tech-savvy communities, I think are still kind of built in IRC.

396
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,000
What is our chat room running on?

397
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,000
No, I know, I know, but I'm outside of us.

398
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Oh, well, we offer some things.

399
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:32,000
I've been using it since probably 2000 and, you know, off and on.

400
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:40,000
Yeah. I know, I know I used to use it a lot in college, but now it's really just vog stuff is really all I use it for.

401
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,000
I still keep up with my LiveJournal people on IRC.

402
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Do you really? Yep.

403
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
I guess it's hard to let some things go, isn't it?

404
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:53,000
Because the LiveJournal, the fact that you're even still hanging with LiveJournal people says something because that website kind of...

405
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,000
Well, I mean, I don't use that site anymore, but the people are still around.

406
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:01,000
Yeah. And Tiger Claw in chat says, but it won't be long until we see vog on Curse or Discord.

407
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:08,000
No, no, no, I'm not saying anything like that is happening. I am saying that other people have asked me why we haven't gone that way.

408
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,000
And usually I'll just kind of, you know, that's not my department. Bobby does the tech stuff.

409
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:18,000
But no, but I also, I know very well the whole reason Slack wasn't going to work was the fact that we didn't want to have to invite people.

410
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:22,000
We wanted it to be an open door. That was a big barrier for the whole Slack thing.

411
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:31,000
So, I mean, I'm not going to say we're never going to go that direction, but there's going to have to be a compelling argument for us to fix something that's not broken.

412
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
Does that make sense? IRC and this whole thing, it's not broken.

413
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:38,000
So there has to be a compelling argument to evolve that, if that makes sense.

414
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:43,000
So anyway, yeah, I'm curious. Why do you dislike Discord, DarkSakura? I use it.

415
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,000
I hate it out of spite for all of those times I want to raid.

416
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:52,000
And it says, must have Discord. Fuck you. I don't want to talk to any of you people.

417
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
That's not Discord's problem. That's the community's problem.

418
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
And the fact that they rely on Discord for all of it.

419
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
I see. It's annoying. I don't want to be pigeonholed into it.

420
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:09,000
But all these people just, when I was playing, not even two years ago, it was Team Speaker Ventrilo. Just replace Discord with Team Speaker.

421
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,000
Why? Because it was easier. I liked it better. And I'm old fashioned.

422
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:21,000
No, the thing is, I just hate that it's become a requirement for so many things. Especially when my voice wasn't working.

423
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,000
Okay. No, I get that. So it's a different...

424
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,000
I hate the dependence on it.

425
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:33,000
Okay, so it's not the software you have a problem with. It's what a crutch it's become for some people, I suppose.

426
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
Yeah, exactly. And they only want it to be voice chat.

427
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:42,000
And I'm like, you can just as well type in the raid chat as you can in whatever their chat is.

428
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:51,000
Well, and without going too far down this alley, but I know this is an issue. Some girls don't like to get on voice chat.

429
00:37:52,000 --> 00:38:03,000
Because, especially if it's strangers, some guys are trash when they hear a girl. Not all. Some become instant trash when they hear a girl get on the chat. Right? Am I right?

430
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:11,000
Yeah, but I'll tell you what is funny. We had a raid a couple weeks ago that was probably 70% women.

431
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:22,000
And this one guy just started being a shit and everyone just went off on him. It was like that lioness photo where they all attacked the lion. And then we booted him out.

432
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:26,000
So there's no room for that in my life.

433
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
Behave yourself, boys and girls. But everybody behave yourself.

434
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,000
The future is female.

435
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:39,000
Alright. Let's see. I'm looking in chat over at live.fognetwork.com.

436
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:46,000
Bonds006 says, DarkSakura, these kids and their newfangled chat programs. Back in my day, Yahoo chat was all you need.

437
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,000
I never used Yahoo chat.

438
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
Aim. Aim for life. AOL instant messenger.

439
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
ICQ.

440
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:58,000
What about just the fucking AOL chat rooms? Not even aim.

441
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:05,000
You know what's funny now is that when I went to what store? It was freaking 99 cent whatever store.

442
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:13,000
When you would go pay for something, the little register thing would go, uh oh. And I'm like, it's the ICQ sound. Oh my god, it's followed me.

443
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:27,000
Triggered by the past. I love it. Alright. Anyway, so yeah, I just wanted to kind of get into like, wow, Twitch has been in the press a lot lately and I want to talk a little bit about live streaming and what you guys all think of this.

444
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:33,000
What this could be for the future of, you know, because Twitch is a pretty big part of the gaming community.

445
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:40,000
And not, you know, I keep saying Twitch, Twitch, Twitch, Twitch. But we also know that YouTube clearly wants a piece of this.

446
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:46,000
You know, they've tried to launch their thing. And this whole Microsoft Beam is kind of a wild card right now, I think.

447
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:54,000
It depends how fast Microsoft kind of ramps that up. I'm very curious to see what they unveil at E3 that they might do with Beam.

448
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:58,000
Because Beam has the whole thing where you get rewarded for participating. You get the little sparks.

449
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:06,000
And usually that's just so you can play noises in other people's streams. Like, that's the only thing that people really thought to do with it yet. The, uh oh, you can play it in somebody's stream.

450
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:15,000
But I'm sure there's going to be other things before too long that Beam wants to do because they're more about, like, especially the interactive games.

451
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:20,000
They want to do more of that stuff too where it's like, it's not just dropping sounds, but you can actually control the game.

452
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:25,000
And like maybe for a thousand sparks you could drop an enemy into somebody playing Dark Souls on Beam.

453
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:35,000
So that is still kind of a wild card that's lurking. But that whole live stream thing is really like, I mean, even five years ago we were looking at the future of live streaming.

454
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:42,000
And I feel like in some ways it's only just beginning. Because this was all about the shift for the gamers to get into it.

455
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:47,000
But now you see the mainstream starting to get into it more and more too. It's going to be very interesting. Very interesting in the coming years.

456
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:51,000
Any other thoughts on Twitch before we get into our gaming weeks? Streaming and all? Alright.

457
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:59,000
Let's get into our gaming weeks. Every week we like to talk about the types of video games that we have been playing this week to set the stage for where our gamer brains are at.

458
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
Dark Soccer, how was your gaming week?

459
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:05,000
It's been mostly Breath of the Wild. Dan and I are doing kind of our co-playing thing.

460
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:13,000
Because I basically just spot a lot more things while he might be focused on something else.

461
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,000
So there's that. I've actually been playing a lot less WoW since we've been doing that.

462
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:22,000
But they finally put out the last LFR for the Nighthold.

463
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:26,000
So I did the Gul'dan raid and it's like, oh my god.

464
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:35,000
Dear Tanks, there's a site called WoWhead. And if you've never done the fucking raid before, study it.

465
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,000
There's also a channel that does raids in two minutes.

466
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
Maybe you should get on Discord and explain it to me.

467
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:48,000
Girl, no. I ended up having done the fight before, just never finished it.

468
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:51,000
Telling the Tank how to tank. And I don't tank.

469
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,000
Maybe you should tank.

470
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:58,000
No. I remember when I tried. For like a hot minute when I had Rebecca Black.

471
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:02,000
Who was permanently at level 85 and is now my bank alt.

472
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:06,000
But you only play her on Friday, Friday.

473
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:13,000
My heart weeps. Don't cry for me Argentina.

474
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:16,000
Now, you may have hurt Bobby's feelings in our chat.

475
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:20,000
Bobby Blackwolf says, the anti-tank rant is why I quit Final Fantasy XIV.

476
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
Because I was dumb and my first character was a tank.

477
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:32,000
No, no, no. There's a difference between people criticizing your tanking style and going into a fight fully ignorant.

478
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
Bobby would also listen to what anybody told him.

479
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,000
Like if we said, Bobby do this. He'd be like, okay.

480
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:46,000
Yeah. That's okay. If you take your feedback or if someone says, hey, try this instead. This mechanic's gonna happen. That's fine.

481
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:53,000
The guy we had would not do anything that people suggested. Had no idea.

482
00:42:54,000 --> 00:43:00,000
And I'm like, finally I'm copying and pasting out of Wowhead. Tanks. This.

483
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,000
And then we finish the fight.

484
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
Congrats. GG. I'm beating it.

485
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,000
Thank you.

486
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,000
You're welcome.

487
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,000
But, oh my God. Oh my God.

488
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,000
Alright.

489
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:17,000
Oh yeah. And I'm still kind of on best of move in Pokemon Go.

490
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:21,000
Awesome. Let's go to Loki. How was your gaming week?

491
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:28,000
I didn't really play that much this week. I've been having to actually program. So that's what I've been doing.

492
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:33,000
But I did play a little bit of Skyrim and just the bare minimum of Pokemon Go.

493
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
And that's really it.

494
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,000
That's it?

495
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,000
Yeah.

496
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,000
Alright. How about you, JD? How was your gaming week?

497
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:48,000
Pretty good. I mean, the Switch is still new to me. So I've been playing a bit of Zelda. I've been playing some of the other games like Voice.

498
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:54,000
And I bought Snipperclips. And that was a lot of fun to play around with.

499
00:43:55,000 --> 00:44:00,000
It's like two joy cons. And we only figured out the two player mode. But apparently it supports up to four.

500
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:04,000
And that was a lot of fun. It's a cooperative puzzle game.

501
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:09,000
I've also been playing with my 3DS a lot. I still take that back and forth to work with me.

502
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:13,000
So I've been doing Street Passes and Rhythm Heaven Megamix.

503
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:20,000
How do you enjoy, as a music game fan, how do you enjoy Voice? Do you think it's a good addition to the Switch?

504
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
Or do you think it's kind of a cash in or what?

505
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:29,000
I mean, I liked it. I've played a couple hours on it. Or maybe an hour or so. And it was alright.

506
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:34,000
I tried it on my phone first because it's free there and I wanted to see if I would like it.

507
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:39,000
And comparing my Android with the Switch, I was impressed by the size of the screen.

508
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:44,000
I'm like, this makes a touchscreen music game a lot easier because you have more room to maneuver around with.

509
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:51,000
I liked it. I don't know any of the songs. And for music games, that's often a bonus if you know stuff.

510
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:56,000
But I like the soundtrack well enough. The play style seems great.

511
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:03,000
We tried the first couple and it was really easy. And the difficulty definitely scales up.

512
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:08,000
Yeah, well you figure the easy level first few songs are going to certainly be easy.

513
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:14,000
And also you have the luxury of, you've played a lot of music games so a lot of it just kind of comes naturally to you.

514
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:19,000
Like, tap here when this happens. Okay, well I've played Elite Beat Agents before. I'm already a leg up, right?

515
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:25,000
Yeah. Cool. So you're enjoying the Nintendo Switch overall? You didn't own a Wii U, right?

516
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:30,000
I bought a Wii U in January because I'm like, if I'm going to get one at all, it needs to happen.

517
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
Oh, you wanted one before they were gone for good. Got it.

518
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
Because there are still Wii U exclusive games that I wanted to have.

519
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,000
For now.

520
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,000
Well, okay.

521
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
For all you know, Mario Maker will show up on 3DS. Well, Mario Maker's already on 3DS.

522
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:47,000
It did show up on 3DS, but on Switch and all that stuff before too long.

523
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:54,000
Yeah, but I mean, the Wii U I got also because there were a couple of Wii games I didn't find, so it made it really easy to buy those digitally as well.

524
00:45:55,000 --> 00:46:00,000
But yeah, I didn't manage to get a pre-order for Switch, so I waited six hours at Best Buy.

525
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,000
Wow.

526
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,000
I mean, that's better than a lot of people had to wait, so.

527
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
And that was six hours in the Bay Area, which is where all the tech nerds are.

528
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:13,000
In San Francisco, and it was like, I don't know, like 40 degrees out or something. It was cold that weekend.

529
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
I had to get my husband to deliver me blankets and a burrito.

530
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
Important stuff to get through the weekend.

531
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,000
Yeah.

532
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,000
But, well, you got your Switch though and all as well.

533
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,000
Yeah.

534
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:29,000
Good, good. Alright, let's see, my gaming week. So, I've also been playing quite a bit of Nintendo Switch.

535
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
I mean, there's always still like, you know, the Final Fantasy XIV, the Overwatch as well.

536
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:39,000
But, I was playing a little bit of Zelda earlier on in the week, but then I actually kind of started to drift away from that for a little bit.

537
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:44,000
I mean, nothing's wrong with Zelda. It's still a great game, but it's just like, oh, this console plays other games too.

538
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:50,000
I started playing Shovel Knight. I said I was not going to buy Shovel Knight. I swore a banana wasn't going to buy Shovel Knight.

539
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:57,000
And then I was like, maybe I'll just buy it again. I'll get the Treasure Trove, because it has the Plague of Shadows and all the other stuff.

540
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:06,000
I'll just buy it again. So, I might own Shovel Knight on as many platforms as I own Mass Effect 3 on now. I might be at that point.

541
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:10,000
But at least Shovel Knight is awesome, just like Mass Effect 3. So, I was playing some of that.

542
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:17,000
And then on Friday, a game that I was really anticipating on the Switch came out, and that is Blaster Master Zero.

543
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:24,000
And I really tried to temper my expectations, because you might remember there was Blaster Master Overdrive, I think it was called on the Wii.

544
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:32,000
And it was okay. I didn't hate Blaster Master Overdrive, but it didn't really capture the magic of the original, and I think a lot of that was just like,

545
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:38,000
I think some of the physics was kind of reinvented, and so it felt a little clunkier than the original did.

546
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:44,000
Something felt off the whole time I played Overdrive, and it wasn't bad, but it was weird.

547
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:52,000
So, I was kind of expecting to go through something similar with Blaster Master Zero, but I have to confess, I really like Blaster Master Zero.

548
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:59,000
I like it a lot, and it really brings back a lot of the spirit of the original Blaster Master.

549
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:04,000
So, here's the thing, because people are wondering, is this a remake? Is this a sequel? What the hell are they doing here?

550
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:13,000
Here's the thing, Blaster Master Zero is to Blaster Master on the NES, what Metroid Zero was to Metroid on the NES.

551
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:20,000
So, it's like the first part of the game is pretty much the same, but then you start to get into other levels, and different things start happening.

552
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:27,000
There's more bosses, there's slight differences to the level, like Area 2, they completely changed the setup for it.

553
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:33,000
They make it a housing area or something like that, whereas in the NES version, it was like another swampy area or something.

554
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:40,000
They changed things very subtle like that, but I noticed you still kind of go through a very similar progression with items and so on.

555
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:49,000
So, yeah, that's kind of the best way I can describe it. If you have played Blaster Master on the NES, Blaster Master Zero is kind of like what they did with Metroid Zero.

556
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:54,000
However, some other things they've added, some huge quality of life improvements from the original.

557
00:48:55,000 --> 00:49:00,000
You now have the ability to save your game, you have restart points, you don't have lives anymore.

558
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:05,000
You just have restart points that once you cross it, you can restart from that point, and you have maps.

559
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:10,000
You can use a map, and so it actually feels a lot more like Metroid, which the original kind of did.

560
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:23,000
Maybe the only thing I could say that actually is kind of surprising me about Blaster Master Zero so far that may get it some backlash or whatever is that it's pretty darn easy.

561
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:35,000
Like, it's really easy. Actually, I have not really had a struggle in anything until I hit the part of the game where it's like you have to time a jump just right to land on a ladder.

562
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:42,000
And that part of the game was actually really infuriating me because it's like, God, the rest of the game has been so fucking easy right up to this point.

563
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:48,000
But I think part of the reason why Blaster Master Zero is a lot easier is A, those two quality of life changes I just talked about,

564
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:55,000
and B, the fact that your gun is way easier to power up than it was in the original, and it does different stuff.

565
00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:03,000
In the original, when you powered up your gun, it kind of changed the shape and things like that, and it was cool. You could get it really strong.

566
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:13,000
But in this one, as your gun powers up, you get a charge shot, an auto shot, a flame thrower, and then you get this super powerful wave beam that just cuts through walls.

567
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:25,000
And if you can hang on to that, it's really easy. Because in the original Blaster Master, every time you took damage, not only did your health go down by one, but your gun power went down by one.

568
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:32,000
In this one, that is still the case, but the gun power ups are handed out like candy, so it's really easy to get back up to eight.

569
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:43,000
And then you get an item really early on that's like a shell, like spoiler alert, but it's not a big deal, it's like a shell for your gun meter that basically you can get hit one time without losing any gun power.

570
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:51,000
And that shell regenerates after like 30 seconds. So it's like you're allowed to make one fuck up every 30 seconds so you don't lose gun power.

571
00:50:52,000 --> 00:51:01,000
And so it really makes the game a lot easier than the original. But you know what? I'm not as good at video games as I was when I was nine when the original Blaster Master came out.

572
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:11,000
There's a part of me that actually kind of appreciates the scale down and difficulty. Now I don't know if maybe a harder mode is going to open up when I beat it or something. I'm not through the whole game yet. I'm up to area five.

573
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:19,000
But I'm not sure where that's all going to go. But yeah, I'm just really enjoying the game from a nostalgia standpoint.

574
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:31,000
And I think the thing that's important to note too is that it's only $10. Which for games nowadays, especially like launch titles on a new console, that's really pretty darn reasonable.

575
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:38,000
So that's great. Because that's how much virtual console games would cost almost in some cases. So I'm glad to hear about that.

576
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:47,000
TigerConChat asks, does the new Blaster Master game use the story about the boy and his frog? Because it wouldn't be Blaster Master if it wasn't about that.

577
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:55,000
Here's the thing about that. Yes it does. It does use that story. But it goes a little further with it. Here's the crazy part.

578
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:04,000
So do you guys remember, years ago, there used to be a bunch of books that were written on NES video games. It was the Worlds of Power books.

579
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:13,000
And they did one on like Castlevania, Simon's Quest, and there was Ninja Gaiden. And there was all these different games that they did the books on.

580
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:23,000
So they did a book for Blaster Master. Well, that book introduced a character into the universe called Eve. Eve is in the game.

581
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:33,000
So I don't think it's the first time she's appeared. I think she showed up in either the Wii one or the Game Boy one they did a long time ago.

582
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:45,000
So I don't think it's the first time Eve has shown up. But it's still neat to me that this character that was created in a book that was totally a side story that wasn't really part of canon, kind of became canon.

583
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:55,000
So I thought that was really cool that they did that. So Eve is now a character in the game. I'm not going to spoil much more than that, like why she's there or anything like that, but you will see that.

584
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
So I think that's kind of cool that the books inspired that.

585
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:03,000
So, Stoppy in chat says the book is canon. Yeah, I guess it is now.

586
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:16,000
And Dark Tetsuya points out, to be fair, that wasn't even in the Japanese original. That was all the US Division's idea. Yeah, the whole frog thing, the boy losing his frog, that was not in the Japanese original because they localized that like years later.

587
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:23,000
Yeah, Stoppy points out Eve was in the PS1 Blaster Master. That's what it was. But I just think it's funny that she shows up here too.

588
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:29,000
Anyhow, I really enjoyed Blaster Master Zero and I would recommend it. And Shovel Knight is a good game too.

589
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:37,000
Okay, but I will talk about one game that I didn't really care for. And I'm sorry, JD, because it's a game that you brought over, but you already know how I feel about this.

590
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:49,000
And that is, I did not enjoy that new Bomberman game at all. And that's probably because I don't really, like, I kind of think the Bomberman franchise is kind of overhyped.

591
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:58,000
Like, as far as classic games go. Like, everybody's got something, right? So, if you are thinking I'm crazy by saying that, then you're probably going to just feel different by nature about Bomberman Zero.

592
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:06,000
But, you know, Shane was really trying to tell me I should get Bomberman Zero. I want to get Bomberman Zero. We can play multiplayer. But I was like, no, I don't really care for Bomberman.

593
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:14,000
And I don't know what this game is going to do to make it any better. And it doesn't, like, the controls feel, like, JD, is it just me? The controls feel kind of sluggish in that game.

594
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:17,000
No, I think you're right. Like, I noticed, like, it felt a little weird.

595
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,000
Yeah, there is something patching that out, too.

596
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:31,000
Well, I don't think it's a delay thing, because I was noticing that, just, like, with a regular controller, also, it was, like, it just, something about, I mean, it feels kind of silly to say physics in a 2D top-down game, but it feels like the physics are off.

597
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:35,000
And the voice acting is super annoying.

598
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:40,000
Oh, it's hilarious. Like, especially as you play as Aqua and you start winning, and, yeah, no, it's funny.

599
00:54:40,000 --> 00:55:02,000
Okay, so I was playing as the Black Bomberman, because this thing I saw on Twitter made him look hilarious. And as you are circling around the outside, because when, okay, that was one thing I thought was kind of a neat little change on the formula, was that when you get knocked out in Bomberman, you revive on the edge of the plat field, and you can fire bombs as a ghost into the, back into the field, and if you knock somebody else out, you take their place.

600
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:04,000
Yeah, Revenge has been around for a couple of...

601
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
Oh, has it? That shows you how often I've been playing these games.

602
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:08,000
Yeah.

603
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:18,000
So anyway, so, okay, so the Revenge thing is there, but every time you fire a bomb as the Black Bomberman, take that! Take that! Take that! And I'm like, shut up!

604
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:23,000
All of the characters give a line when they throw a bomb as Revenge, and that is kind of annoying.

605
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:31,000
Yeah, so I'm just, I'm not hearing, I'm not feeling the Bomberman game, but if you guys are enjoying it, good for you. Hooray.

606
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:35,000
But yeah, I'm glad I didn't spend the money on that, but there's other great Switch games to check out.

607
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:42,000
Zelda, Zelda, Zelda, Zelda, and, you know, Barman, or Bla, Barman, Blaster Master Zero I think is great,

608
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:49,000
and Shovel Knight, of course, if for some reason you've missed Shovel Knight until now, that's a great game too.

609
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:53,000
I still haven't had my hands on 1-2 Switch yet, I'll probably get there eventually.

610
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:57,000
And then what, next week we're going to have Binding of Isaac, a new version of that is out on the Wii U.

611
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:05,000
Get your systems together, Rob, on the Switch, so that'll be really exciting too. Cool!

612
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:13,000
Tigerclaw in chat says, Sky, maybe the character should have said bombs away, bombs away, bombs away.

613
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:15,000
I mean, there are eight characters.

614
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:22,000
One of them probably does. Anyhow, that's my gaming week. That's enough, I've gone on long enough.

615
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:28,000
So, housekeeping tonight, I don't have a lot, except I do want to promote for sure, Sac Indie Arcade is coming up,

616
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:33,000
it's coming up on April the 8th, we're going to be broadcasting all day from the West Sacramento Convention Center,

617
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:38,000
if you are in Northern California, I highly encourage you to make the drive and check it out.

618
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
Sac Indie Arcade is going to be a lot of fun, we'll be there live all day.

619
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:46,000
This time I'll go to all of the rooms instead of realizing there was an extra room they didn't go to at the very end.

620
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:53,000
Yes, and I'm hoping we might have extra help this year so that we don't have to be at the table 24-7 so that we can actually go play some more of the games.

621
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
That'll be very exciting, so that'll be cool.

622
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000
Dan will be running the Atari Party table again too.

623
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:03,000
Oh, so Atari Party is making a cameo again, that's great. Atari Party was fun.

624
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:07,000
So, it's not just indie games, but kind of a celebration of other gaming too.

625
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:12,000
I will definitely make sure we get Gabe and Brie back on the show before that day if they are available,

626
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:17,000
so we can talk all about what to expect at this year's Indie Arcade, because I know they have all new speakers, it's going to be a good time.

627
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:19,000
So, look forward to that.

628
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
I do not know if we will end up having a show the next night.

629
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:26,000
Something has come up where Jamie and I may have other obligations the very next night,

630
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:31,000
and we figure if we are broadcasting all day long the day before, then perhaps we deserve a night off.

631
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:37,000
So, more to come on that as we approach April, that would be April 9th would be the show date for that,

632
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:39,000
we'll let you guys know as that gets closer.

633
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:46,000
Anyhow, in the meantime, let's get into some gaming news and what's going on in gaming this week. Loki.

634
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:54,000
Alright, so Nintendo talked a little bit about, hey, where the heck are those streaming services that are not on the Switch?

635
00:57:55,000 --> 00:58:02,000
And, well, they said that Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon will be coming in some time.

636
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:12,000
And, you know, they basically said, you know, what they basically were saying is that their system is more of like about the games on the system.

637
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:19,000
And then, of course, they're talking to other companies about bringing those services, because they said that they're not differentiators.

638
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:25,000
What differentiates the Nintendo Switch is, you know, the games and how they're played.

639
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:29,000
That sounds like a cop-out to me, if you really got to ask.

640
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:34,000
I do think it's a bit of a cop-out, but it's one they can kind of get away with right now.

641
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:40,000
Like, you know, there's enough stuff on the Switch right now, especially with how freaking good Zelda is,

642
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,000
there's enough stuff on the Switch they can kind of get away with right now.

643
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:50,000
So, it's, you know, and I think it's a great line, the whole, like, we just want the system to be about games.

644
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:57,000
But I just can't believe that in their, you know, five-year plan for the system, their ten-year plan, however long they want the Switch to be viable,

645
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:01,000
I just don't believe that they wouldn't try to ever bring in some of this other stuff.

646
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:05,000
And again, I think it's just one of those things that will show up this holiday.

647
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:10,000
And then, suddenly, and the reason why I bring this up, because I'm sure some of you guys, I'm not even looking at chat at the moment,

648
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,000
I'm sure some of you guys are saying, yes, Rob, a gaming console should be about the games.

649
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:22,000
Look, my point I'm making is that that line that they're saying right now is going to do a 180 this holiday when they do launch Netflix and that stuff.

650
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:30,000
That's my point, is that it's just a convenient line right now for what they have available, but come holiday when they do have the rest of that stuff,

651
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:38,000
they're going to say, well, not only did we want to be the best gaming system with the best games like Zelda and Splatoon 2, we wanted to bring you even more!

652
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:40,000
And that's the thing, I'm calling it right now.

653
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:48,000
It's not a differentiator. It actually is a differentiator, because you're launching with an online service that's not as robust as your competition. Period.

654
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:55,000
That's how it is. And yes, your system is different in the way it plays games. That is also a differentiator.

655
00:59:56,000 --> 01:00:03,000
But you can't dismiss that this is not a differentiator, especially when, as you said, a few months from now, they're just going to fucking flip that line anyways.

656
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:08,000
It is. Just accept it, say yes, it'll come in time. That's it.

657
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:10,000
Which is essentially what he said.

658
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:14,000
Right. Pretty much. With the differentiator part added in there.

659
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:18,000
Stoppy in chat says, you don't think there's enough on the Switch? Wait till it gets hacked.

660
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:30,000
Look, here's the thing. It's not that I don't necessarily think there's enough on the Switch at this point, you know, especially, I mean, that was a pretty, for one week after launch, that was a pretty good week the Switch had last week.

661
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:36,000
I really enjoy Blaster Master Zero. JD says voice is worth it if you're a music game fan.

662
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:43,000
You had the Neo Geo games, which I'm surprised Dark Sakura hasn't kind of poked her head in, what's this? But you probably have the original Neo Geo games.

663
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:49,000
But that's available now on the Switch. What is it? World Heroes Champions is one of them. One of the Metal Slug games.

664
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:51,000
World Heroes is...

665
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:53,000
There's four or five games.

666
01:00:54,000 --> 01:01:02,000
All these indies and old titles can, you know, keep the Switch going, but it's going to take third party support aside from indies.

667
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:10,000
And that's what the major consoles have right now, except for the Switch. Doesn't it really have a lot of stuff coming out third party wise right now?

668
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:20,000
But here's my point. Here's my point. The week that the Switch just had this last week, the Wii U did not have a week like that one week after launch.

669
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:32,000
The Wii didn't have a week like that one week after launch. So if this is the trend for Nintendo is going to be pumping out like a pretty big, even if third party, indie, whatever it is,

670
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:45,000
if the Switch is able to pump out like a title at least worth turning your head at, and Nintendo's did a pretty good job with that news thing that it does seem to update in your sleep and it doesn't connect to the internet.

671
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:56,000
So it kind of lets you know right when you turn on the system, hey, this game is available. Nintendo may not have that whole problem with, oh gosh, there's no games available on it that they had with the Wii U.

672
01:01:57,000 --> 01:02:08,000
But the Wii U launched with a ton of titles. I bought a lot of those titles. So that's not really an argument. They launched with way more titles than the Switch. I don't remember what the Wii U had, but I know the Wii U had...

673
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:12,000
There was a bunch of crap that was on PS3 and Xbox already, except now it was the touchscreen.

674
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:20,000
This is true. They did have a lot of things like that, but that's what they're doing now with the Switch. It's stuff that was on the Wii U, but now it's on the Switch.

675
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:28,000
So it's the same thing, except now they just aren't releasing them right at day one. Instead they're saying, hey, look, it's coming out in April.

676
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:45,000
I literally watched their trailer for the whole Mario Kart 8 on the Switch, because it's a fucking Wii U title, and showing what the features are and the new differentiators as I use his line.

677
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:58,000
It's nothing. It's literally two characters and, oh shit, we put Battle Mode back in there because it fucking should have been in the first place. And now you get two items. Big fucking deal.

678
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:08,000
See, that's Loki's opinion, but I'm looking in chat over at live.voggenetware.com. A10 in chat is asking, are you going to get Mario Kart 8, Rob? Yes. I will rebuy it.

679
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:12,000
I'm hoping they don't try to pull the $60 price tag on it.

680
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:21,000
Oh, you bet your ass. You bet your ass that shit's gonna be fucking $60. We'll see. I'm betting all the DLC characters in that purchase.

681
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:32,000
I'm pretty sure they are, but it doesn't matter. I already bought it on Wii U. But I will rebuy it on the Switch to have it portable and to be able to play, because you'll get Mario Kart 8 as well, right, JD?

682
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:40,000
Yeah, I didn't actually get Mario Kart 8 for Wii U, because I just bought it recently, and I was like, well, I'll just wait until it comes out on the Switch, and the same with Splatoon.

683
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:44,000
But then when you come over and play Mario Kart 8, we'll both be able to play on our Switch. It'll be awesome.

684
01:03:45,000 --> 01:04:01,000
The other thing I have to admit was kind of neat about the Switch. Since JD did bring his system over, it was so easy and fucking convenient to want to play Bomberman, all we had to do was take my Switch out of the dock, put JD's in, Bomberman time. It was that easy.

685
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:05,000
So, I mean, actually, no, not with Bomberman, we just moved the cart.

686
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:09,000
Bomberman was a cartridge, so we just switched the game out for Snipperclips.

687
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:11,000
That was at Snipperclips.

688
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:13,000
Which is DLC only.

689
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:23,000
But still, that made it awfully convenient to show off another game or what have you. This is something that isn't as easy on PlayStation 4 or Xbox One, if you don't have it on disc.

690
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:27,000
And pairing the Joy-Cons was also really easy. All you have to do is just attach them to the console.

691
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:38,000
Yeah, for sure. Let's see, so, TigerClaw in chat says, is the new Mario Kart 8 going to have all the DLC from the Wii U version, and I mean stuff like playing as Link and some other Nintendo characters outside of Mario.

692
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:44,000
Yes, and I think it's going to have more, too, because it's going to have the Splatoon Kids and King Boo.

693
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,000
Well, the Splatoon Kids were in there already, I thought.

694
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:49,000
No, not the Splatoon Kids. They weren't there.

695
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:55,000
No, Animal Crossing was there, and I haven't even seen them, but I'm sure they're in this one.

696
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,000
Animal Crossing and Zelda were the big DLC packs.

697
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:00,000
I thought that they were in there.

698
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:02,000
Nope, they're new.

699
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:04,000
Oh, who gives a shit?

700
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:14,000
Well, I'm not that big on the characters, but again, it's more about the fact that now I'll have it portable, and the battle mode stuff will be neat, so I'm very excited about it.

701
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:20,000
So, there we go. Let's see, going to chat over at live.fognetwork.com.

702
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,000
BbBlackWolf says, I give a shit. LOL.

703
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:30,000
Let's see, ActDeft also says, I'm one of those that give a shit. So, low-key, some folks give a shit.

704
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:35,000
And you know who else gives a shit? People that buy fucking Apple products year after year after release.

705
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:40,000
It's fine, if you want to buy the same product over and over again, then more power to you. I'm just not going to do it.

706
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:44,000
That's why everybody gets to have an opinion, I suppose.

707
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:46,000
Even if they're wrong.

708
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:58,000
Alright. Well, here's the thing, low-key, interesting sales news about this, but it is coming from Nintendo, so I suppose you could take a skeptic's angle to this.

709
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:11,000
However, in an interview that was in the New York Times with NOA President Reggie Fils-Aime, he mentioned that the Switch in America and Canada has outsold the Wii in a two-day period.

710
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:19,000
This means the Switch has surpassed 600,000 in sales if you break the numbers down in that same region.

711
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:29,000
So that could mean that if you consider worldwide, because Japan sold another 313,000, they probably sold a million at least in that first week, which certainly is outpacing Wii U.

712
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:36,000
Now, I'm going to say it before you can, because I totally understand the skeptic's angle to this.

713
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:40,000
It's much easier to sell them when you made enough to put them on the fucking shelves.

714
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:52,000
Exactly. Because they would have sold a ton more. I guarantee if they had an infinite amount of product available, they would have sold more of the Wii than they would have the Switch.

715
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:57,000
J.D., when you were at that Best Buy, were there people that got turned away who couldn't buy a Switch because they ran out?

716
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:09,000
I didn't stay long enough to find out. My Best Buy had two lines, so the people who were in the no pre-order line, they let some of them in, and then some of the pre-order people, and just alternated.

717
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
So I left it at 1230, and I was fine.

718
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:14,000
Gotcha. I figured there might be some people who left it there.

719
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:21,000
And how nice of them to be able to see them, Nintendo, being the ones that actually control that shit as far as how much product is available.

720
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:25,000
How nice to say that, oh, look at the Switch is doing so much better than the Wii.

721
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:31,000
Okay, I get that, but that skepticism aside, at least there is a positive I see with this.

722
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:36,000
Is that the Wii U didn't have a supply problem.

723
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:38,000
Oh no, it did have a fucking supply problem.

724
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:44,000
I was able to find one that morning that it launched without waiting in line, I just casually went into Target and picked one up.

725
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:52,000
I mean, I think after maybe that initial period, then yeah, there was a supply problem, but you didn't see it fly off the fucking shelf like the Wii did.

726
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,000
Oh yeah, no one's gonna argue that the Wii U was a strong platform at all.

727
01:07:56,000 --> 01:08:06,000
But then I would say that is good news for Nintendo, because they have to do better than they did with Wii U, and it looks like the Switch is doing better than Wii U.

728
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:09,000
Well, just saying.

729
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
I mean, that's such a low bar to explain.

730
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:16,000
Well yes, it was a low bar, but Nintendo had to overcome it.

731
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:18,000
Good job.

732
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:20,000
How does it compare with the original Wii, though?

733
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:24,000
Because I know the original Wii was selling really well, because of Wii Sports and all that.

734
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:30,000
It did, but not until it was already out for a year, because nobody could fucking buy one when it was first out.

735
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:38,000
Yeah, and they're not gonna fucking play that angle. They're not gonna say, well, our fucking distribution line was fucked up like crazy, and now it's just less fucked up.

736
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:45,000
Okay, I'm gonna really try to think back. Dark Soccer, think back with me. You gotta go back in your brain ten years. You ready?

737
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:52,000
Remember when y'all went to that Target, and Xtifer was there, and you were there, and Maggie and Chris went too, right?

738
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,000
It was just, actually it was me and Kristen.

739
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:57,000
I thought Xtifer was with you.

740
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,000
I thought Xtifer was with you, or did he go to a different store?

741
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:01,000
He went to a different store, I think.

742
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:03,000
Okay.

743
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:05,000
Because we went to the Target in Citrus Heights.

744
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:07,000
Maybe he went somewhere else. All right, but all that stuff aside.

745
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:09,000
We bribed our way in line.

746
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:15,000
How many Wiis were sold? Like 14 or something, right?

747
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:19,000
Something like that? No, there were more, because everyone who was in line got one.

748
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:21,000
But it wasn't that...

749
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:23,000
It was like 20.

750
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:27,000
JD, were there more than 20 people in the pre-order line to get a Switch?

751
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:32,000
I was like 20th in line, and I got there at 6pm. There were definitely lots more people than that in line.

752
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:37,000
So the point is, they had 20 Wiis on day one, and way more Switches on day one.

753
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:44,000
Yeah, they were giving out tickets, and they were continuing on around the corner of the building where I was, so they definitely had more stock.

754
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:49,000
Now granted, I am comparing Target in Sacramento to Best Buy in the heart of the Bay Area.

755
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:52,000
However, I would wage your money. This is still a safe comparison.

756
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,000
I mean, it's only one of two Best Buys in the city, so...

757
01:09:56,000 --> 01:10:00,000
Yeah, so there's just plenty more availability of the Switch.

758
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:10,000
Okay, then perfect. And I hope that they do have that availability going forward, because they're not going to have any excuses then if it still doesn't outperform the Wii.

759
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:13,000
Then they're going to have no excuses.

760
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:18,000
Holiday is going to be fascinating. Holiday is going to be very, very fascinating for the Switch.

761
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:28,000
Because it will be fascinating to see if the Switch still has that same momentum, like that must-have system going into Holiday, and what Nintendo's going to do to it to really kick it in the ass.

762
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:33,000
It's going to be more than a Mario game, and I think this is what they're saving the Netflix angle for.

763
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:42,000
I'm telling you, this is what Switch is going to do. It's going to have Netflix, but you're going to be able to watch Netflix on the TV, and then thanks to downloading Netflix, you can pick up...

764
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:50,000
It's not a differentiator. It really doesn't matter. It doesn't matter at all that it doesn't have Netflix or has Netflix, because it's not a differentiator.

765
01:10:51,000 --> 01:11:00,000
Alright, anyway. Moving on, the Switch is selling, but how well it's selling, I suppose, is open to how you want to read into that.

766
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:06,000
We'll hopefully see some harder numbers in about a month's time, especially when Nintendo's financial year ends.

767
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:15,000
Meanwhile, though, we're going to go on to a different topic. I know Nintendo's really been dominating the conversation the past few weeks. It is a new system after all, but other gaming news going on as well, right, DarkSakura?

768
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:17,000
Kind of weird. Weird news.

769
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:19,000
How so?

770
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:29,000
Well, basically, two unlikely game developers are getting in bed and making sweet, sweet music game love.

771
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:31,000
Oh my god, yes.

772
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:33,000
Except not in the way that you think it is.

773
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:41,000
So it's Hasbro and Harmonix. And they are putting together a music card game.

774
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:52,000
So, and I had to bring this one up because, you know, we started off as a music game show and we, you know, had our long line with harmonix through the life of the show.

775
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:54,000
Of course.

776
01:11:55,000 --> 01:12:06,000
Doing a card game called DropMix. It was basically you play different cards that have the bass, the beat loops or vocals of a song on a DropMix board.

777
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:15,000
And when the card is played, the corresponding piece of music goes on with a phone, be it iOS or Android, that's connected to the board.

778
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:20,000
So as multiple cards are placed, the app starts merging them into a track.

779
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:33,000
And basically it's using the NFC to be read by the board. And it's got actually a pretty decent list of songs. I mean, just different.

780
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:37,000
It's got like Earth, Wind and Fire, September. It has the final countdown.

781
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,000
I wonder who's going to build a sequence. It's just nothing but that.

782
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,000
We've got Run DMC, It's Tricky.

783
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:46,000
Oh wow.

784
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:51,000
Some friends for Nan Afrijack, Bruno Mars, Young MC. So Busta Move is in there.

785
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:53,000
That'll be fun.

786
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:57,000
Weezer's King of the World, A Tribe Called Quest Scenario, some Skrillex, whatever.

787
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:01,000
Can you mix, can you mix the songs together?

788
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:03,000
It's got churches in it.

789
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:05,000
Interesting.

790
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:06,000
That makes me happy.

791
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:07,000
Can you, can you mix the songs together?

792
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,000
It doesn't say anything about it, but it's going to go for a hundred.

793
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:11,000
Uh huh.

794
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:20,000
It's available in September and it will have a 16 and no, it has an additional 16. And okay, let me start over.

795
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:30,000
It comes with 60 cards in the game board. It comes with an additional 16 and five card packs will be released for 15 and $5 respectively.

796
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:34,000
And new cards coming out through 2017.

797
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:41,000
I love that we've still got DLC in a harmonics music game, even though, you know, the card games have done this for years.

798
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,000
So it's funny to me. This is their version of DLC.

799
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:48,000
Yeah, it's more like BC, Buyable Content.

800
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:51,000
Well as long as you're only buying the songs you want, it's not so bad.

801
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:53,000
Unless they're mixed up.

802
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:57,000
Well with card games, this is the fucking norm. Like take any card game, this is the norm.

803
01:13:58,000 --> 01:13:59,000
Who in this room played Magic?

804
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:01,000
Cards Against Humanity. Hello?

805
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:03,000
No, no, Magic's even worse than that.

806
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:07,000
But anyway, who in this room still plays Magic?

807
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:09,000
Rageinator, raise your hand.

808
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:11,000
It got way too expensive.

809
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:13,000
I'm sorry?

810
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:15,000
I played the Pokemon trading card game a little.

811
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,000
Keep in mind, I've sold two full collections of Magic cards.

812
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:24,000
I was going to say, I sold my Magic the Gathering trading card deck my junior year of high school. That's how long that fucking game's been around.

813
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:26,000
I played all the way through my first round of college.

814
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:28,000
But it's a fun game. No disrespect.

815
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:38,000
But I wanted to say about this, I love the concept of how they're utilizing smartphones as a game controller.

816
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:46,000
Very similar, like Jackbox Party Pack kind of rethought that whole thing to how to do a party game with a bunch of cell phone controllers.

817
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:48,000
It's kind of like Harmonix has done that in a different way though.

818
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:55,000
They're using it now with an analog game, I suppose, or a more traditional board game, the smartphone controllers,

819
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:57,000
as opposed to a video game like what we saw at Jackbox.

820
01:14:58,000 --> 01:14:59,000
It's the marriage of genre right there.

821
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:05,000
I just had a thought. What is Jackbox going to do with the Joy-Cons on the Switch? Because that would be amazing.

822
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:12,000
I don't know, but if I remember right, the whole trilogy, the Jackbox trilogy, I think shows up on that.

823
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:16,000
Indie games coming for Switch, so they're doing something.

824
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:25,000
Yeah, I don't know. We'll have to email our friends over there and see if they want to come on to talk about the Switch version when it releases.

825
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:32,000
And why we're going to buy their game again, just like I buy fucking Shovel Knight and Mass Effect 3 and all this other stuff.

826
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:38,000
Kaijuto in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says, we have the living card game now, Rob.

827
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:43,000
The trading card game is getting phased out, so not every card game has that now.

828
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:46,000
I thought deck building games were all the rage right now.

829
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:48,000
Ascension and Dominion.

830
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:51,000
Ascension, Dominion, and I played one that was all DC comic.

831
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:56,000
Oh yeah, there's the DC deck building game, which is the actual name of it. There's also a Marvel one called Legendary.

832
01:15:57,000 --> 01:16:02,000
What's the one where it's like a PvE type of card game, where you're fighting a boss sentries of the...

833
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:04,000
Sentinels of the Multiverse?

834
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:09,000
Sentinels of the Multiverse, that's it. I thought deck building was the huge thing right now in card gaming.

835
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:11,000
Yeah. I mean, it is one of the...

836
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:16,000
It's fun! I love the concept of a PvE card game as opposed to a PvP card game.

837
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:23,000
I mean, the concept is like you're playing a comic book thing out and you choose your character based on which deck you pick out.

838
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:25,000
Yeah.

839
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:27,000
I mean, it's very comics-flavored. It's a lot of fun.

840
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:31,000
Alright, let's move on. Boy, our first part of the show is going along tonight, but that's okay.

841
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:37,000
It always seems like the slower news weeks, which, yes, I know PAX happened this weekend. We're on the wrong coast.

842
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:42,000
It seems like it was kind of a slower news week this week because everybody's too busy playing fucking Zelda, which I understand.

843
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:47,000
But it's the slow news weeks. They always have longer shows. Go figure. Loki.

844
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:51,000
So, Share Factory is getting quite the update on PlayStation 4.

845
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:56,000
So, the biggest part about it is you can actually import your own clips now.

846
01:16:57,000 --> 01:17:02,000
Or external clips, I should say, using like a USB flash drive so you can put your own photos, your own video clips.

847
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:11,000
Along with that, they've also added over 30 textures that you can use to personalize text in the game.

848
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:23,000
They also have a new infomercial theme. There's a new photo mode collage thing, new stickers, and then, of course, updates to the overall UI.

849
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:30,000
I might have read this wrong, but didn't I hear that you can put GIFs in now? Like, you can load GIFs into your videos?

850
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:40,000
Maybe. Because if so, like, it's over. Like, I'm going to go to town with GIFs because my favorite thing is on Twitter and Share Factory.

851
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:47,000
Which, you know, when that first came out, I was playing around a lot with Share Factory. I think I still have something up on my YouTube channel.

852
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:52,000
Like, I compiled all these Final Fantasy XIV things into something in Share Factory.

853
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:58,000
You know, it's a pretty powerful little tool that I think is really underutilized. Probably because it takes a little time to learn.

854
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:05,000
But I'd be very curious how these new features kind of might make it better. And now the fact that you can kind of mix in your own stuff, too, would be really cool.

855
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:10,000
I have to say, one advantage of Slack over IRC is that you can do GIFs so much easier.

856
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:16,000
That is true. That is true. William Ritterface in chat says, can you import your own snipper clips, though?

857
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:25,000
Well, if you can import your own video, yes, you could. You would capture the footage of snipper clips on your PC or whatever, holding a phone up to the screen if you have to.

858
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:33,000
And then you could import that into your PlayStation video. So maybe I want to make a video in Share Factory that's nothing but my favorite Forza Horizon clips.

859
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:37,000
That's funny. Alright, anyway.

860
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:46,000
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, corn.

861
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:53,000
Moving on. Nintendo making money this week, but no, not from the Switch. Something else.

862
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:59,000
And honestly, even though they're making money in theory, they probably won't see any of this money for a good long time.

863
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:10,000
Here's the deal. It's $12.76 million Canadian dollars. Sorry, it's Canadian dollars because a Canadian federal court ruled in the favor of Nintendo America.

864
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:24,000
This was Nintendo America taking GoCyber Shopping Limited and the owner, Jeremy King, to court this week because this company was distributing circumvention devices, flash carts, mod chips, game copiers, all the things that Loki loves.

865
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:30,000
Sky 3DS, Gateway 3DS, and all those similar devices the court ruled is illegal.

866
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:37,000
And so he was found, I guess, guilty of being a distributor of all these game copy devices and so on.

867
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:44,000
And so I guess at one point he used to kind of boast about what he did, or at least that's what I'm reading about in these stories.

868
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:51,000
I don't have an example of that though. But now he's going to have to apologize on his website for the damage that he caused Nintendo.

869
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:59,000
Nintendo in a statement saying, Nintendo continues to be a leader in bringing innovative gaming platforms and software to our fans and millions of gamers across the globe.

870
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:06,000
Blah, blah, blah, track record, blah, blah, blah. We will vigorously enforce our intellectual property rights against those that attempt to steal or misuse them.

871
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:08,000
Yeah, like making YouTube videos of them.

872
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:17,000
Yeah, but no $12.6 million judgment in a YouTube case. Although I'm not going to argue Nintendo and some of their YouTube rules are pretty shitty.

873
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:27,000
But there's a big difference between Zelda music in a YouTube video and flash carts, game copiers, mod chips with the intent to copy software.

874
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:32,000
Not to Nintendo. That's the problem. There's no difference to that.

875
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:37,000
So do you think they're going to take me to court because I did a video on Legend of Zelda 8-bit on YouTube?

876
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:39,000
They'll monetize it.

877
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:48,000
I'm sure, I think they already did. No, I demonetized the video because I'm like, if I can't make money, neither can you. Ha ha ha ha ha. That's what I did.

878
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:52,000
But if you were making money, they would, they still may put ads on it.

879
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:58,000
Please. I'm not going to make, I'm not going to make money on YouTube. Let's be real. Let's start there.

880
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:06,000
Stopian Chat over at live.vognetwork.com says, that is so Canadian. His sentence is to apologize.

881
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:12,000
Come on. Anyway, let's see.

882
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:19,000
Dark Tetsuya Chat says, reminds me of when they nailed the guy behind the 76,001 Nintendo 64 Famiclone system.

883
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,000
There was a huge magazine ad about it when he got in trouble.

884
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:29,000
And aren't, people are reselling those mini NES classics with a bunch of games loaded into them, right?

885
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:31,000
So they're just asking for too much.

886
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:33,000
Who's selling them because I haven't found any in the stores.

887
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:37,000
Speaking of supply issues and fuckery in Nintendo.

888
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:40,000
Can't even get that system out.

889
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:43,000
Alright, anyhow, moving on. Just a few more stories before we get to the classic game of the week.

890
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:45,000
But first, our Sakura.

891
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:47,000
Mass Effect. Of course.

892
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:49,000
Ermagerd, it's almost here.

893
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:51,000
I know, right?

894
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:53,000
Have you watched any of the stuff that's come out of PAX?

895
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:55,000
Tried not to.

896
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:57,000
Are you trying to keep yourself spoiler free?

897
01:21:58,000 --> 01:21:59,000
Yeah, except for the important things like character customization.

898
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:01,000
Yeah.

899
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:03,000
Because that's all I care about.

900
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:05,000
Of course.

901
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:07,000
And hey, can you fuck that? There's that too.

902
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:16,000
One of the things that got let out under Twitter is that you can pick which of the twins that you start with.

903
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:19,000
But then you can change your mind while doing customization.

904
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:24,000
So in effect, that means you can customize each of the rider twins.

905
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:28,000
And looks like a bunch of customization will go in.

906
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:37,000
So there also will be a lot more in the way of decision making that's going to affect the outcome in that.

907
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:44,000
But they said that the Mass Effect Andromeda character selection and character creation will be a lot like Fallout 4's.

908
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:49,000
Where you have them switch back and forth while they, you know, you can customize each character.

909
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:56,000
And then once you are in that position, then you can no longer customize it.

910
01:22:56,000 --> 01:23:00,000
Although I know the community, there's going to be mod tools out before too long.

911
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:03,000
So that's cool stuff.

912
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:10,000
Yeah, I like the fact that the whole like the parent or the dad I guess kind of looks like how you customize the twins.

913
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:12,000
It's kind of interesting.

914
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:15,000
Well, they kind of did the same thing in Dragon Age 2, remember?

915
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:23,000
Where whichever of the siblings that you had, their appearance was based on what you chose for your hawk.

916
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:30,000
So to probably a much lesser extent since I doubt that it was as sophisticated as what Andromeda.

917
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:32,000
Frostbite is going to help.

918
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:41,000
But it'll be fun. And given what I've played in Frostbite games already, having played Dragon Age Inquisition, I'm looking forward to the level of customization.

919
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:51,000
I mean if someone can make What's His Face from the Wild Thornberries in Dragon Age or Nicolas Cage in Dragon Age because he's in everything ever.

920
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:55,000
They can do that for Mass Effect.

921
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:59,000
I'm very excited from what I'm hearing on Mass Effect multiplayer.

922
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:03,000
It sounds like it's going to be faster paced than Mass Effect 3, which is already pretty fast paced.

923
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:08,000
But that they're not really changing the core. It sounds like it's still going to be very similar. The core elements the same.

924
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:15,000
But the nice thing is you're not going to be required to play it at all. They're not doing that galactic readiness thing they did in Mass Effect 3 or any of that.

925
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:22,000
So you won't be required to play it to get the good ending. I think it's something about you can send out strike teams to do things.

926
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:29,000
And either you just send them out and they do it, or you are a part of that strike team in the multiplayer.

927
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:31,000
Like that's how it works.

928
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:33,000
In Inquisition?

929
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:35,000
Oh yeah, it was like the same thing in Inquisition, yeah.

930
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:40,000
Yeah, you'd have your table missions and then it would unlock certain parts of the map for you.

931
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:45,000
And as you walked through Skyhold, you did run into the multiplayer characters.

932
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:47,000
Yeah, I bet it's a similar thing.

933
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,000
You couldn't talk to them, but they were hanging out there. Except Isabella, dammit.

934
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:53,000
I was tickled when they put Isabella in multiplayer.

935
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:59,000
So maybe, I don't know, maybe magically Blasto will show up.

936
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:00,000
Blasto will show up.

937
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:06,000
What are the characters that we know and love or will love in the new Mass Effect game will show up.

938
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:11,000
But not a lot of plot spoilers leaking out still, which good. That's the stuff we don't want to be spoiled on.

939
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:13,000
That's the stuff that Dark Soccer doesn't want to hear about.

940
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:18,000
But people are going to start playing it, what, Thursday, right? Is when EA Access or whatever that thing is.

941
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:23,000
Origin is going to get that 10 hour preview or whatever of Mass Effect.

942
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:27,000
So look out because spoilers are incoming on Thursday.

943
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:30,000
That's why I'm getting the heck out of town this weekend.

944
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:34,000
Alright, moving on. Loki.

945
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:43,000
Alright, so Bethesda has kind of talked about what the actual free to play model for Quake Champions is going to be.

946
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:51,000
So basically you start off with the Ranger and that's kind of your free character in the game.

947
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:59,000
If you feel like you want to try a different character, you can buy access to each of the characters for some sort of price.

948
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:07,000
And then, yeah, so you get one free but you have to buy the rest.

949
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:16,000
You get only one free. Did you say it's rotating or you just get to pick one and that's the one you get?

950
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:25,000
Yeah, well you get one. So here's the other thing though. You can also, if you don't want to pay for the actual players like the other characters,

951
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:30,000
you can also earn that money with in-game currency called favor.

952
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:36,000
And that will also unlock the characters for a set period of time.

953
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:42,000
So you can also buy backpacks and brooms and whatever.

954
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:48,000
So basically it just sounds like a free to play model for a game. Not that surprising.

955
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:54,000
I'll still check it out. I like Quake games and so if it's free to play, why not? Just check it out at least.

956
01:26:55,000 --> 01:27:01,000
And the other thing, they showed off a little bit of one of the new champions that they have.

957
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:14,000
So they have Nyx who, let's see, I guess she's pretty agile and she has an ability called Ghost Walk that allows her to move between dimensions.

958
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:18,000
So while she does that, she's invisible and immune to damage.

959
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:21,000
So she's Sombra.

960
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:23,000
Yeah.

961
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:26,000
Since I think we all know what game may have inspired Quake Champions.

962
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:29,000
You don't say. The Game of Money? Is that what it is?

963
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:31,000
Yes.

964
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:37,000
Alright. Well also, a game that's no stranger to making money, Parappa the Rappa. That's right.

965
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:42,000
Parappa the Rappa. Remember they're re-releasing it again, but it's the remastered version for the...

966
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:46,000
How can you remaster that? I mean it's pretty basic looking as it is.

967
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:48,000
Yeah, but they were very pixely.

968
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:53,000
Well, and it's widescreen supported now. Remember the original was PlayStation 1 so it was a 3-4 ratio.

969
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:55,000
That's kind of a stretch.

970
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:59,000
Yes, that's what they're doing. They're stretching the image out to fill an HDTV.

971
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:08,000
So, Parappa the Rappa, you guys already forgot. They released Stage 1 during the PlayStation experience, I think it was, a couple months ago.

972
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:10,000
So I think folks forgot this is coming.

973
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:12,000
Yeah, they did. Surprise!

974
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:20,000
Well, it's been dated and dollared. It's going to come out March 8th for us in North America, which means it's out, I guess.

975
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:23,000
Did Parappa the Rappa remaster come out and I've missed it?

976
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:26,000
I think so. March 8th, I guess, I totally missed.

977
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:31,000
Oh, wow. I've been too busy with the fucking Switch to notice that this came out.

978
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:36,000
This might not have been the best time to release Parappa the Rappa stealthily on the PlayStation 4.

979
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:39,000
But it is $20 is what it's going to cost you there.

980
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:44,000
So, April 4th in Europe for $11.99, local currency.

981
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:49,000
And in Japan, April 20th, you get that on $420 for 1,800 yen.

982
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:52,000
So, there it is. ActDeftInChat says, you gotta believe that it's already released.

983
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:59,000
Yeah, I haven't really checked on what released on the PlayStation 4 store this week because I've been distracted with Zelda.

984
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:01,000
They should have released it the week before the Switch came out.

985
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:10,000
Yeah, or something. Also, one reason why Japan has to wait a little longer for it, there's actually going to be a physical release of this in Japan.

986
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:15,000
So, you can actually get a Japanese copy of the game with the box art, which looks really cute.

987
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:21,000
You can check that out. That will come out with the game on April 20th.

988
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:29,000
Also, don't forget, LocoRoco remastered and Patapon remastered are also scheduled for the PlayStation 4 at some point this year after this.

989
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:31,000
So, exciting stuff.

990
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:34,000
Alright, well, we're going to take a trip down memory lane.

991
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:42,000
And every week, DarkSakura steps into the gaming vault and finds a game that she thinks ought to be remastered.

992
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:46,000
But once in a while in 2017, she brings out the whole damn system.

993
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:48,000
Yep.

994
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:51,000
DarkSakura, what is the classic console of the month of March?

995
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:54,000
Of March. The WonderSwan.

996
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:59,000
And I think that at least two people in this room own some kind of WonderSwan.

997
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:04,000
I do. A very generous listener of the show. I don't know if he listens anymore, but actually, um, Ram-

998
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:06,000
He's got a WonderSwan crystal, right?

999
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:11,000
Yeah, Ram like a gaming company thing that resold this stuff and got me one, so that was really nice.

1000
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:16,000
I have a WonderSwan color. I actually have the Final Fantasy I and II WonderSwan color.

1001
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:23,000
So, but let's go back into the original WonderSwan, which actually, your ex-roommate had a WonderSwan color.

1002
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:25,000
No, a regular WonderSwan.

1003
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:29,000
And that's where I played Beatmania on WonderSwan, which is now background music for us.

1004
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:34,000
It was the best home version of Beatmania as well. All the music was perfect.

1005
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:39,000
So anyway, the WonderSwan was a handheld game console that was released by Bandai.

1006
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:45,000
It was actually developed by Gunpei Yokoi's company, Koto Laboratory, with Bandai.

1007
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:51,000
So, um, it came out in 1999 amongst the fifth generation of consoles.

1008
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:57,000
And then there were two later versions, as I just mentioned, the WonderSwan color and the Swan crystal.

1009
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:06,000
All of them being supported until 2003, so there were no releases of this outside of Japan.

1010
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:18,000
It was a 16-bit system, but it actually had a really, really long battery life in comparison to the Game Boy Color at the time and the Neo Geo Pocket Color.

1011
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:20,000
Those were its contemporaries.

1012
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:22,000
And it had a lower price point.

1013
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:26,000
Honestly enough, I think the games looked a bajillion times better on it, too.

1014
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:34,000
It had different upgrades to it, you know, like I said, that add color and it had great audio.

1015
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:36,000
I mean, just listen to this for a second.

1016
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:39,000
Yes, I will. This is a sample from Beatmania.

1017
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:49,000
Here we go.

1018
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:54,000
Remember that thing?

1019
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:56,000
Yeah, the cat song.

1020
01:31:57,000 --> 01:31:58,000
But doesn't that sound perfect?

1021
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:00,000
Yes, it sounds purrrfect.

1022
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:03,000
But this is on a handheld.

1023
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:08,000
Keep in mind, the Game Boy Color one at the time was shit. Sorry, it was shit.

1024
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:12,000
Comparing the Beatmania GB to this is like night and day.

1025
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:28,000
Yeah, so the awesome thing about the WonderSwan is that you can play it horizontally or vertically, which the Klonoa game, which I've got for WonderSwan, it uses both orientations for some of the levels.

1026
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:30,000
So it's really cool.

1027
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:37,000
It had a lot of good third party support, mostly from Square, Namco, and Taito.

1028
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:49,000
They sold something like, for all of its iterations, something like 3.5 million units in Japan and had 8% of the Japanese handheld market at the time before the Game Boy Advance came out.

1029
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:52,000
Ooh, this is the other video of some of that third party stuff, huh?

1030
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:54,000
Yeah.

1031
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:03,000
Maybe not the most riveting music of the game.

1032
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:06,000
Let's see how far we're going to...

1033
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:08,000
Let's try to see if we can go here.

1034
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:10,000
I gotta wait for it to load now.

1035
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:13,000
Little crystals coming together.

1036
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:15,000
There we go.

1037
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:17,000
Exactly.

1038
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:19,000
There we go. That's the song I know.

1039
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:22,000
This is what I bought my WonderSwan color for.

1040
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:24,000
I played the crap out of this.

1041
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:36,000
So anyway, in the past, Bandai had done a bunch of handheld games.

1042
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:43,000
They did a lot of licensing, like they had Tetsu on Adam, which we got as Astro Boy.

1043
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:46,000
They did LCD games in the 70s.

1044
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:51,000
They did the Intellivision in Japan.

1045
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:53,000
They worked a lot for the Famicom.

1046
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:57,000
And then they had, of course, the Tamagotchi and Digimon.

1047
01:33:58,000 --> 01:33:59,000
So we knew that that was a thing.

1048
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:05,000
So they basically went in a bit further and kind of did this on their own without other support.

1049
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:12,000
We also knew that Yokoi created the Game Boy for Nintendo.

1050
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:21,000
But after the Virtual Boy kind of went kaput, he created Kodoo Laboratories so that they could work with Bandai to make the WonderSwan to compete with the Game Boy.

1051
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:26,000
So basically, he kind of parented two systems here, right?

1052
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:31,000
So moving onward, they picked the name WonderSwan because of its aesthetics.

1053
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:34,000
It had a 30 hour battery life.

1054
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:38,000
I don't think it really was that close to it, but it did okay.

1055
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:40,000
It came with all kinds of colors. Nine colors.

1056
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:43,000
Some of them discontinued later on.

1057
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:48,000
And I mean, as you can hear, the music was amazing.

1058
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:54,000
So I would say it was more on par with the Game Gear and Lynx as far as its capabilities.

1059
01:34:55,000 --> 01:35:03,000
And then later on, the WonderSwan Color came out that had the full color screen and had backward compatibility with the WonderSwan games.

1060
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:10,000
And it came in different colors and had the special edition for Final Fantasy 1 and 2, which is the one that I have.

1061
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:13,000
I forgot to take a picture or I would show everybody.

1062
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:27,000
And then the Swan Crystal came out in 2002 and it was actually 7800 yen, which was about 1000 yen less than the Game Boy Advance.

1063
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:30,000
And it looked better and it sounded better.

1064
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:38,000
It had a much better screen on it, but Nintendo already had a little bit more of the name recognition and it was only released in Japan.

1065
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:44,000
So it didn't have the international support, you know, that Nintendo of course had with a lot of this.

1066
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:51,000
They also were powered, get this, by a single AA battery. All of them.

1067
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:53,000
As crazy.

1068
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:59,000
Yes. The Swan series were all from the single AA battery.

1069
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:11,000
The WonderSwan Color, just double checking, it actually had 512 kilobits of RAM, which for the handheld at its time, was pretty amazing.

1070
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:17,000
The WonderSwan Color would last about 20 hours with the battery.

1071
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:26,000
In this one, Crystal actually had a little bit less because it was also a more powerful system, but it lasted 15 hours.

1072
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:29,000
So really kind of negligible because who's going to sit and play it for 15 hours, right?

1073
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:38,000
There were also other accessories. There's one called the Wonder Witch, which is a software development kit for amateur programmers.

1074
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:40,000
Which is what I call myself on the weekends.

1075
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:45,000
Girl. But it also allowed people to develop games and see.

1076
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:51,000
There was an adapter for headphones, because it didn't have a headphone port.

1077
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:59,000
Kind of like what they did with the, which of the Game Boy models was it that had this, the SP.

1078
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:01,000
Like the adapter for that.

1079
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:09,000
It also had a remote controlled robot called the WonderBorg, that you could operate with your WonderSwan.

1080
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:17,000
It can be connected to a pocket station to transfer save files, and it used a device called the WonderWave to do that.

1081
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:27,000
So, and it also became one of the early internet capable handhelds that used a phone network.

1082
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:29,000
So really great stuff.

1083
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:31,000
She got on the internet too? Jesus.

1084
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:35,000
Right? I mean the thing was really ahead of its time.

1085
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:37,000
Sorry.

1086
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:43,000
So other games that came out on it, of course, and I'm even just thinking of the ones that I have.

1087
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:46,000
They had a version of Go to Pay, of course.

1088
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:53,000
It had Final Fantasy, Final Fantasy II, Final Fantasy IV, Space Invaders, Densha de Go!

1089
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:57,000
We had Beat Mania. We had some Clone Ola games.

1090
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:01,000
I've got a Digimon game myself. I think I might have mentioned it.

1091
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:06,000
There was, um, hold on, I'm going to pull up the list of games here real quick.

1092
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:10,000
So, let's see.

1093
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:13,000
So we've also had Ark of the Lad on it.

1094
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:18,000
Um, and I'm looking at just the color games here. A ton of Digimon, a Dragon Ball game.

1095
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:26,000
We had Final Fantasy III was scheduled for it and cancelled, Front Mission came out, Golden Axe, Guilty Gear Petite, that's the other game I have.

1096
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:32,000
Um, uh, Hatsuraku Chocobo, which is Working Chocobo, another Square game.

1097
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:38,000
Um, Inuyasha games. We had a bunch of Gundam games.

1098
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:44,000
Um, Makai Toshi Saga, Mr. Driller, Namco Super Wars.

1099
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:47,000
Um, Romancing Saga, Rockman EXE.

1100
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:53,000
And I think that on the original one there was, um, Rockman and Bass, wasn't it?

1101
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:57,000
Came out. They were going to put Secret of Mana on it and that got cancelled.

1102
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:02,000
Uh, had Super Robot Tyson compact. Uh, had a Yamato game.

1103
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:08,000
Just all kinds of stuff. It was, it was pretty amazing. Great library.

1104
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:16,000
Um, there are, and by the way, there are emulators out there, like I, though I wouldn't say emulate it, but maybe the only way you can try some of these games.

1105
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:20,000
Yeah, maybe. Unless you want to pay like 800 bucks for one on eBay of somebody linked in our chat room.

1106
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:25,000
Yeah. Well, I've got mine and it'll play everything that I want it to, but, you know.

1107
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:27,000
So screw everybody else.

1108
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:31,000
You know, the one thing though is that I kind of want a black and white one because of Beatmania.

1109
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:35,000
Because Beatmania had a little add-on that was the scratch wheel.

1110
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:41,000
And it doesn't fit very well on the, um, the color. Because the color's a little thicker.

1111
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:43,000
Yeah, yeah.

1112
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:48,000
But, um, it was really fun playing Beatmania with that because you just have to figure out, you know, map where your buttons are and then there you go.

1113
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:56,000
So, um, I honestly think that if someone has a chance to get their hands on a WonderSwan, totally go for it.

1114
01:39:57,000 --> 01:40:01,000
Even if it's just the first model WonderSwan, it's an amazing little handheld system.

1115
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:07,000
And, um, I even think to this day it's still pretty excellent competition.

1116
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:12,000
Yeah, especially just considering like how ahead of its time it was in some ways. It's just, you know, we just didn't get it here.

1117
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:18,000
It's like a lot of the systems that I've, you know, put on the list were, I'd honestly say, ahead of their time.

1118
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:23,000
You know, but the WonderSwan color is probably, um, among one of my favorites.

1119
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:28,000
Alright. There it is, your classic console of the month, the WonderSwan family.

1120
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:32,000
Oh, another point? When I bought my WonderSwan color, it was at Game Masters and Burlingame.

1121
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:33,000
Uh-huh.

1122
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:41,000
No, was it Game Masters? I forgot. You know the store. I also bought my copy of, um, uh, great.

1123
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:47,000
The name, the little stick figure with the music. Vib ribbon.

1124
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:49,000
Vib ribbon? Yeah.

1125
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:52,000
Yeah. I got my copy of Vib ribbon the same day and Kitty the Cool.

1126
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:54,000
Nice. Best day ever.

1127
01:40:55,000 --> 01:41:00,000
Right? I came out of that game that day making out like a bandit and Dan picked up like a bunch of Saturn games.

1128
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:01,000
Cool.

1129
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:02,000
So, I just remember that was a good day.

1130
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:08,000
Alright. There it is, your classic console of the month. Dark Soccer will be back with a game next week.

1131
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:14,000
But in the meantime, we're going to take a quick break. There is more Orange Lounge Radio to come, including news on No Man's Sky.

1132
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:16,000
That's right. We're going to talk about that when we come back.

1133
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:20,000
And we're going to talk a little bit about the Final Fantasy VII remake and a little bit about Zelda Breath of the Wild as well.

1134
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:24,000
And of course, your phone calls, Orange Lounge Radio on Skype.

1135
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:27,000
Your emails participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

1136
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:31,000
And much more when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1137
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:42,000
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio. Live tonight, March the 12th of 2017.

1138
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:46,000
Episode number 679 of our show already in progress.

1139
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:50,000
We'll be getting to your call soon at Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.

1140
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:57,000
And then, of course, we always have our chat room as well over at live.voggenetwork.com where why are we talking about the N-Gage in chat right now?

1141
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:01,000
What is the N-Gage chat happening right now in chat?

1142
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:03,000
I had one.

1143
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:06,000
You had one? You did? I forgot about that.

1144
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:09,000
Yeah, remember I was like the only one who went over to the N-Gage booth at E3?

1145
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:11,000
Because they looked lonely.

1146
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:13,000
Yeah, they did look lonely. They didn't give you an N-Gage though, did they?

1147
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:16,000
No, Dan and I had N-Gages. Both of us did.

1148
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:18,000
Oh, I don't even remember that.

1149
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:22,000
We did a couple of other friends because, well, I think at the time Dan was working at Gamestop.

1150
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:24,000
Yeah.

1151
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:26,000
But something like that.

1152
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:28,000
Yeah, so probably, you know, got one as a preview or whatever.

1153
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:30,000
Yeah.

1154
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:32,000
To talk it up to potential sales.

1155
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:34,000
Yeah.

1156
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:40,000
Yeah. Oh, dear N-Gage. The good old taco phone. How I miss they. Anyway, we were enjoying some nice food there during the break. Some Stroopwafel, of course.

1157
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:42,000
You know, the must have here at OLR.

1158
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:47,000
And then, so you or Alan, somebody found those marshmallow Peep cookies.

1159
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:49,000
I saw them and I had to have them.

1160
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:53,000
But they're, okay, they're not, they don't taste like Peeps at all.

1161
01:42:54,000 --> 01:43:01,000
Like I know DarkSakura, not a fan of the marshmallow stuff, but those cookies don't, like they taste like nothing to me. They literally, it tastes like nothing.

1162
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:03,000
It doesn't taste like soap, but it tastes like nothing to me.

1163
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:06,000
I mean, to me, I think they're better than Oreos, but worse than Peeps.

1164
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:11,000
I guess so. And then, there's Carrot Cake Hershey's Kisses.

1165
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:18,000
Which I saw at Rite Aid and it was one of those, like, I have to just buy this to see like if this is for real.

1166
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:21,000
And then DarkSakura was willing to try one of those, but you were like, it tastes like soap.

1167
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:27,000
Yeah. I just, anything that tastes that sweet that I would have normally liked before, it just tastes absolutely bizarre.

1168
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:29,000
I'm sorry.

1169
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:33,000
I don't know if it's the antibiotics or if it's my own fucked up nose or whatever.

1170
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:35,000
Or I just wanted to wash your mouth out with soap.

1171
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:39,000
I'm way beyond washing my mouth out with soap.

1172
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:43,000
I'd have to, like, deep throat an assembly line at Dove.

1173
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:47,000
Dove chocolates or Dove soap? Alright, anyway.

1174
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:49,000
We'll see.

1175
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:55,000
Alright, let's do some rapid fire news, some other quick news stories here that happened in the past week in games. Loki.

1176
01:43:56,000 --> 01:44:00,000
The closed beta for Gran Turismo Sports is going to be starting actually in a few days. Looks like on March 17th.

1177
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:05,000
Select PlayStation Network users will get invited to participate in the beta.

1178
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:11,000
And when you do get invited, you get the selection of cars you can check out each day.

1179
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:19,000
And of course, you know, it has like the driver profile and stuff that tracks your sportsmanship and race performance.

1180
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:27,000
So cool. I wonder if they have the VR in there as well, because I know that's a feature of the game, but that'd be cool to try that out.

1181
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:29,000
Yeah. I'd be curious what that looks like.

1182
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:34,000
Now I completely forgot that they were doing a live action movie for this, but apparently they are.

1183
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:41,000
So Just Cause, they have their lead actor in the film, Jason Momoa.

1184
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:51,000
And you may remember Jason from such roles as Khal Drago in Game of Thrones, or he's also going to be Aquaman in the new Justice League movie.

1185
01:44:52,000 --> 01:45:00,000
But apparently he is going to be playing Rico Rodriguez, which I don't know how they can do that in the movie, but it sounds awesome.

1186
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:03,000
So I'm down to check it out.

1187
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:10,000
Yeah. We'll see if they finally make a good video game movie, but let's just say my hopes aren't very high.

1188
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:16,000
You just can't really capture the nonsense that's in Just Cause with a movie, but I hope that they do.

1189
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:21,000
Well, some folks in chat are excited about that. Bonds006 says, nice. I will watch a Just Cause film.

1190
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:26,000
Brad from Pod Culture points out Ronan from Stargate Atlantis.

1191
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:34,000
But I know that Aquaman made a cameo in the Batman and Superman movie, right? Which I watched on the plane, and I was like, this is ridiculous.

1192
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:37,000
That was my whole feedback on Batman vs Superman.

1193
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:40,000
Aquaman and the Brave and the Bold, though, was fucking hilarious.

1194
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:42,000
That's pretty funny.

1195
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:46,000
The best thing about Batman vs Superman, no joke, was Wonder Woman. It was the whole reason to watch the damn movie.

1196
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:49,000
That's the only good thing I've heard anybody say about that movie.

1197
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:51,000
What's that?

1198
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:53,000
Actually, the new trailer looks pretty good.

1199
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:55,000
I'll check out the Wonder Woman movie.

1200
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:57,000
That will be the first DC movie I pay money for.

1201
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:07,000
I mean, the movie, to me, looks exactly like Captain America. It's like, this is fucking Captain America with Wonder Woman, which is fine. I mean, it looks cool. It just gets so many Captain America vibes from it.

1202
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:12,000
I wonder if they're going to have her weakness in it, where if she's bound by a man, she loses her powers.

1203
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:14,000
I hope they have her truth lasso.

1204
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:19,000
Well, you know how she was created, right? She was created by the polygraph inventor.

1205
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:28,000
And her lasso was supposed to be, but he was also really into BDSM, so that's why her weakness came in as being bound.

1206
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:33,000
It's also the reason there's a super dickery site, you know, all of these panels.

1207
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:35,000
Yeah. Ugh.

1208
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:43,000
Alright, well, we'll see. VidPower in chat says, the audience erupted when Wonder Woman came on screen in Buffy vs Superman.

1209
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:45,000
Buffy would win.

1210
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:54,000
Why did I read BvS as Buffy vs Superman? Just instantly my mind went to Buffy. Because everybody's been talking about Buffy because of the anniversary this week.

1211
01:46:55,000 --> 01:46:57,000
Well, it's also because Buffy was abbreviated BTVS.

1212
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:00,000
Yeah, that's what it is. Thank you, JD.

1213
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:04,000
Is Superman going to be like a vampire in that?

1214
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:06,000
How's that going to work?

1215
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:10,000
We already know Buffy will beat Edward Cullen.

1216
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:17,000
Okay, thank you, Act F, just pointing out BvS Buffy Vampire Slayer. So that is a common acronym that's used there.

1217
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:23,000
So it's not crazy that I instantly went to Buffy vs Superman, which is the movie they really should have made, let's be real.

1218
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:30,000
Alright, anyway, let's talk about Bloodstained Ritual of the Night, a video game that could be better than Buffy.

1219
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:34,000
Nah, I don't know if anything will be better than Buffy, but Bloodstained will be pretty cool.

1220
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:42,000
It is confirmed, Bloodstained Ritual of the Night, it is coming to the Switch. Confirmed through a Nintendo of Europe advertisement.

1221
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:49,000
Bloodstained is now slated for the Switch. This game, of course, is already bumped back to 2018, so they have plenty of time to put it together.

1222
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:58,000
No clue if it will still release on Wii U. There has been no formal word on that yet, but I have a feeling Nintendo's probably going to pull the plug on Wii U before 2018.

1223
01:47:58,000 --> 01:48:08,000
They're probably going to shut that thing down as fast as they can. Although, it's worth pointing out, we didn't bring it up earlier, but even though the Switch had all these releases this week,

1224
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:16,000
Nintendo Wii U did get a release this week on Virtual Console of all places, because I guess since there is still a Virtual Console on Wii U,

1225
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:25,000
Bomberman 64 was released on the Wii U this week, so if you are a Bomberman fan, I think Bomberman 64 is one of the ones that a lot of people remember.

1226
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:34,000
So, they may not pull the plug on Wii U that fast, but yeah, so it'll be interesting to see if Bloodstained still releases on Wii U, but I'm thinking probably not.

1227
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:41,000
You should probably plan on picking it up on the Switch, but at least that is confirmed that that will be coming there to no one's surprise whatsoever.

1228
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:51,000
Let's see, meanwhile, Wonder Boy the Dragon's Trap, another game that's slated for the Nintendo Switch, but this one will also be on the PlayStation 4 and the Xbox One,

1229
01:48:51,000 --> 01:49:00,000
and then there will be a PC version later in the spring. This game is slated for April the 18th of 2017, that's when it's going to be hitting all those platforms.

1230
01:49:01,000 --> 01:49:07,000
Remember, this is the one that lets you switch between the current graphics and the really cool hand-drawn graphics just by tapping a button, really.

1231
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:19,000
And what's also cool is that if you have old passwords, they work in the new game, so everything that you remember about Wonder Boy from the Sega Master System will come over to this game.

1232
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:24,000
So, Dark Soccer, do you still have Sega Master System codes for Wonder Boy written down somewhere?

1233
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:28,000
Probably somewhere. Well, and if not, there's the internet.

1234
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:36,000
There is this place called the internet, yes. So you can put in all the codes you want there on the remake, so that's pretty cool. Moving on, Dark Soccer.

1235
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:48,000
Well, for those who are excited about Mario Kart 8, it has a new unlockable character for beating the hardest difficulty, which is a gold palette swap for Mario.

1236
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:56,000
And no one curr. That's neat. Yeah. Period.

1237
01:49:57,000 --> 01:50:03,000
And then, happiness, Wreck-It Ralph 2 is a year away! Yay! I love Wreck-It Ralph.

1238
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:11,000
But they basically, you're getting the voice cast back and everything is going to be awesome, and I see Qbert, so that makes me happy.

1239
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:16,000
And I see Eggman and Balrog, or Bison, so that makes me happy too.

1240
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:29,000
So, I wonder if we're going to see actual other video game stuff, as opposed to in the first movie it was mostly made up things, like Sugar Rush was a made up thing, and the whole Fix-It Felix and Wreck-It Ralph, that was all a made up thing.

1241
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:39,000
I remember, of course, the Street Fighter characters showed up, and there was cameos, but you didn't really get to see those other worlds, so I wonder if you'll get to see the other worlds this time.

1242
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:45,000
There's also Alan Tudyk's in it. He was King Candy before, but he's pretty versatile with voices, so I'm pretty excited.

1243
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:51,000
Maybe there'll be a flashback, or maybe there's Robo King or something. Maybe he's back.

1244
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:57,000
Or they get another, whatever he was supposed to be, Roadblasters. Or Turbo, whatever.

1245
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:01,000
Turbo, that's it. He probably comes back from the dead one way or another, I'm sure.

1246
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:04,000
Oh yes, because it wouldn't be without it.

1247
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:06,000
Of course not.

1248
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:08,000
Yeah, but that's it.

1249
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:13,000
Let's travel around the world and check out what is coming out in game stores this week, starting here in the US. Loki.

1250
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:18,000
So we've got Danganronpa 1-2 Reload on PlayStation 4.

1251
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:20,000
Pass. Just kidding.

1252
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:22,000
Bitch.

1253
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:25,000
You still need to sit and play it.

1254
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:28,000
Now if you may pass on that, this might be something you might be more interested in.

1255
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:32,000
Star Trek Bridge Crew on the Vive, Rift, and PlayStation VR.

1256
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:37,000
Well I don't have any of those VR things, but maybe I will borrow yours.

1257
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:43,000
I want to see the folks at the Starboard Power Coupling play this game together.

1258
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:57,000
I think it would be hilarious to get Dr. Ken Rip Roaring Drunk and Captain Matt and Lieutenant Eddie and get him high on life.

1259
01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:03,000
And make him eat the whole bag of Peeps cookies and then play this game.

1260
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:06,000
I think they'd have a lot of fun with that.

1261
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:10,000
Anyway, hopefully that'll be a thing that happens.

1262
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:17,000
And then Styx Shards of Darkness on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

1263
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:24,000
Excel World vs Sword Art Online Millennium Twilight on PlayStation 4 and the Vita.

1264
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:30,000
We have Kona on PC, Mac, and Linux, Xbox One, and PlayStation 4.

1265
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:34,000
And Nier Automata on PC.

1266
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:38,000
And last but not least, Senran Kagura Peach Beach Splash.

1267
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:43,000
For those of you who may not know, Senran Kagura is a big breasted ninja game.

1268
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:51,000
And this one of course goes the whole route of like, hey, we're just giving you some other excuses to have them in bikinis.

1269
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:55,000
So they're literally squirting water on each other.

1270
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:58,000
Yay!

1271
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:03,000
Dark Sakura! Let's do Let's Play.

1272
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:10,000
Yes, it's interesting. Just by the screenshots.

1273
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:14,000
Sorry, this game is also in my Japanese releases.

1274
01:53:15,000 --> 01:53:20,000
And as I was going to put really quickly, just this quote from the page on Wikipedia for it.

1275
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:21,000
Yes.

1276
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:36,000
So it's literally a wet t-shirt contest as a game. That is literally what this is.

1277
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:41,000
So this game is also out in Japan this week. Senran Kagura Peach Beach Splash.

1278
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:47,000
And if you look at the cover, it's just ladies in white bikinis and super soakers.

1279
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:50,000
This is the best version of Splatoon yet.

1280
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:57,000
It would only be good if it had the same music.

1281
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:00,000
The whole little like da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.

1282
01:54:01,000 --> 01:54:04,000
The little like ska music that like the little kids sing. It'll be hilarious.

1283
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:07,000
Alright, anyway. Check that out coming to a...

1284
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:11,000
I'm sorry, I have to look at some of these screenshots. It's one of those like I need to see it to believe.

1285
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:13,000
Yep, I believe it.

1286
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:16,000
This is so stupid.

1287
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:22,000
Anyway, you can get that in a regular version in Japan on the 16th.

1288
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:25,000
You can also get it in a new, new DX pack.

1289
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:27,000
Ooh, DX.

1290
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:31,000
Or a 5th anniversary DX pack. And if you say that real fast, it's Dix pack.

1291
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:35,000
So you can get a 5th anniversary Dix pack in Japan.

1292
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:46,000
You can also pick up a game this week in Japan on the 16th on the PlayStation 4 called Kono Yono Hatte de Koi wa Yutao Shuzhou Yuno in a regular and limited edition.

1293
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:49,000
It's called Rewrite out in Japan this week.

1294
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:55,000
And Excel World vs Sword Art Online Millennium Twilight, which I think Loki referenced here in the US.

1295
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:59,000
And then Disgaea 5 gets a price reduction this week as well in Japan.

1296
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:02,000
So pretty exciting time for you folks over there.

1297
01:55:03,000 --> 01:55:06,000
On the Vita this week, that same Sword Art Online vs Excel World game is there as well.

1298
01:55:07,000 --> 01:55:12,000
As well as that Kono Yono Hatte de Koi wa Yutao Shuzhou is out there as well.

1299
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:15,000
However, Peach Beach nowhere to be seen on the Vita.

1300
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:20,000
So I'm sorry you need the full 1080p experience on your PlayStation 4 for that one.

1301
01:55:21,000 --> 01:55:26,000
On the Nintendo Switch this week, nothing in Japan. At least not retail.

1302
01:55:27,000 --> 01:55:29,000
I don't know what their online service looks like. I don't get those dates.

1303
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:35,000
But I do have some dates for the 3DS, which include Monster Hunter XX is out on the 18th.

1304
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:41,000
That's a pretty big deal and you get all the accessories that come with it as well as the limited edition new 3DS XL.

1305
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:43,000
LL as they call it over there.

1306
01:55:43,000 --> 01:55:48,000
And then another game that dares to compete against it just two days sooner, Future Card Buddy Fight Mezase.

1307
01:55:49,000 --> 01:55:52,000
Buddy Champion is released in Japan this week.

1308
01:55:53,000 --> 01:55:54,000
How about the UK?

1309
01:55:55,000 --> 01:55:56,000
One thing.

1310
01:55:57,000 --> 01:55:58,000
Yeah, too dark for PC.

1311
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:00,000
How dark?

1312
01:56:01,000 --> 01:56:02,000
Two.

1313
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:04,000
Oh, the number two.

1314
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:06,000
So dark they made a movie about it.

1315
01:56:07,000 --> 01:56:08,000
It was perfect.

1316
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:13,000
Alright, moving on. Let's get back into some news. No, we're going to do the mailbag first.

1317
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:15,000
I apologize. We got to get to our emailers.

1318
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:19,000
Participate at orangelaungeradio.com to send us emails every week.

1319
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:24,000
Dark Soccer is going to dive in the mailbag and find emails that are worthy of her attention.

1320
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:26,000
Sticky!

1321
01:56:27,000 --> 01:56:31,000
Hello, OLR. First of all, a very belated congratulations to Rob and Alan for getting married.

1322
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:33,000
I hope you guys are enjoying married life.

1323
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:35,000
Smile!

1324
01:56:35,000 --> 01:56:41,000
I wanted to comment on last week's episode about Mass Effect Andromeda getting a mature rating because of some full nudity in the game.

1325
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:43,000
Yay!

1326
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:45,000
An email about nudity.

1327
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:47,000
Naked.

1328
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:52,000
I was watching a trailer for the game and it hit me how violent it is shooting various alien races in the face.

1329
01:56:53,000 --> 01:56:55,000
This does not seem to earn it a mature rating.

1330
01:56:56,000 --> 01:56:57,000
Sorry.

1331
01:56:58,000 --> 01:57:00,000
Loki's laughing in the kitchen for some reason at this whole thing.

1332
01:57:01,000 --> 01:57:02,000
What?

1333
01:57:03,000 --> 01:57:04,000
Shooting alien races in the face.

1334
01:57:05,000 --> 01:57:07,000
This does not seem to earn an immature rating.

1335
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:09,000
Yet the sex does. How typical.

1336
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:11,000
I'm sure I'm preaching to the choir here.

1337
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:15,000
Well, I don't think, I mean, yes, you shoot things in the face.

1338
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:17,000
I don't think it's blood goes everywhere.

1339
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:19,000
I don't recall that in the older games.

1340
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:21,000
But it's still violence.

1341
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:25,000
It is. It is. But it's more like the Star Trek phasers never really cause blood to show up.

1342
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:27,000
It's kind of that whole violence.

1343
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:29,000
It should have cauterization burned.

1344
01:57:29,000 --> 01:57:45,000
Yeah, you know, but that, I always kind of saw that as the violence in, but I mean, granted, you could set things on fire, you could ice them and then shatter the ice and stuff, but it just, it was like, but that would happen in Super Nintendo Mortal Kombat as well, which was sanitized for violence.

1345
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:51,000
So I think it's just that there's not blood everywhere kind of helps it in that regard.

1346
01:57:52,000 --> 01:58:01,000
However, I do want to say that a well done lovemaking scene in a video game does add a lot as it can, as it can do in a movie.

1347
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:07,000
In The Witcher 3, for example, there's plenty of lovemaking to be done if you romance the right characters.

1348
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:10,000
I do think it adds something meaningful to the storytelling.

1349
01:58:11,000 --> 01:58:14,000
It would be too bad if games were to shy away from this for fear of a mature rating.

1350
01:58:15,000 --> 01:58:17,000
That's it. Love the show as always. Martin the Belgian.

1351
01:58:17,000 --> 01:58:26,000
P.S. being a native Dutch speaker, I'd like to inform you of the correct pronunciation of, ah, I was right the second time, stropwafel.

1352
01:58:27,000 --> 01:58:32,000
So it's stropwafel, like the ah versus the oh.

1353
01:58:33,000 --> 01:58:44,000
I respect that we're probably saying it wrong. However, in this instance, I'm going to play my big stupid American card and be willfully ignorant because I'm sorry, strupwafel sounds cooler.

1354
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:46,000
And I like stropwafel.

1355
01:58:47,000 --> 01:58:51,000
If you're going to look for strupwafel on the store shelf, you'll know exactly how to spell it.

1356
01:58:52,000 --> 01:59:00,000
Pronounce the oh oh as you would pronounce the oh in hope, not the word hoop. Like it were stropwafel.

1357
01:59:01,000 --> 01:59:02,000
Stropwafel.

1358
01:59:03,000 --> 01:59:04,000
That actually sounds cooler. Strupwafel.

1359
01:59:05,000 --> 01:59:06,000
I like strupwafel.

1360
01:59:07,000 --> 01:59:10,000
The word strop means syrup in Dutch. So it literally is a pressed waffle with syrup in the middle.

1361
01:59:11,000 --> 01:59:12,000
What's strop mean? Does it mean like...

1362
01:59:13,000 --> 01:59:14,000
He just said it means...

1363
01:59:15,000 --> 01:59:16,000
Penis or something?

1364
01:59:17,000 --> 01:59:18,000
What's strup mean?

1365
01:59:19,000 --> 01:59:20,000
Okay, Martin, tell us.

1366
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:24,000
Give us an answer, please.

1367
01:59:25,000 --> 01:59:30,000
You know, actually, it's funny. A Dutch person corrected me on how to say my last name. My real one.

1368
01:59:31,000 --> 01:59:32,000
Oh, really? Interesting.

1369
01:59:33,000 --> 01:59:36,000
But I was like, but it's been Americanized.

1370
01:59:37,000 --> 01:59:41,000
I know my actual last name is also Dutch, and I'm sure we're saying it wrong, too, but whatever.

1371
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:50,000
s2100matt points out in chat over at live.vognetwork.com that same reason why some New Yorkers pronounce Mario differently. They say Mario, right?

1372
01:59:51,000 --> 02:00:00,000
And that's kind of, I don't, when I hear Mario, I go, oh, it's not it. But then, you know, everybody has a different accent and we have to respect that, you know.

1373
02:00:01,000 --> 02:00:02,000
We don't have to respect stupid people, though.

1374
02:00:03,000 --> 02:00:05,000
Hey, well, I just because somebody says Mario doesn't make him stupid.

1375
02:00:06,000 --> 02:00:10,000
I didn't say it made him stupid. Just stupid people have stupid opinions sometimes and they're stupid.

1376
02:00:11,000 --> 02:00:12,000
And wrong.

1377
02:00:13,000 --> 02:00:17,000
Like me saying Stroopwafel. I'm going to be willfully stupid in this case. I don't care.

1378
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:19,000
You ignorant.

1379
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:21,000
That's right.

1380
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:23,000
Ignorant.

1381
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:27,000
I claim this name, or I claim Stroop, I claim it in the name of America. All your Stroopwafel are belong to us.

1382
02:00:28,000 --> 02:00:32,000
I'm going to say Stroopwafel. Stroopwafel. That just sounds cooler.

1383
02:00:33,000 --> 02:00:34,000
Ellen!

1384
02:00:35,000 --> 02:00:36,000
Stroopwafel or Stroopwafel?

1385
02:00:37,000 --> 02:00:38,000
Stroopwafel.

1386
02:00:39,000 --> 02:00:40,000
Ellen agrees with me.

1387
02:00:41,000 --> 02:00:42,000
Stroopwafel.

1388
02:00:43,000 --> 02:00:44,000
Stroopwafel. Whatever.

1389
02:00:45,000 --> 02:00:48,000
Hello, LR. Of course, I'm going to email you guys about Xbox Live Creators Program.

1390
02:00:49,000 --> 02:00:50,000
Oh, I already know who this is. Hi, YYR.

1391
02:00:51,000 --> 02:00:52,000
Well, who else sends us hello, LR?

1392
02:00:53,000 --> 02:00:56,000
Thanks for covering it on last week's show. I figured I'd clarify a few things about it.

1393
02:00:57,000 --> 02:01:00,000
First and foremost, yes, it is most definitely the new Xbox Live indie games.

1394
02:01:01,000 --> 02:01:05,000
Similarly, there is very little barrier to entry and there will be little to no curation.

1395
02:01:05,000 --> 02:01:09,000
Likewise, it will be separated from the main Xbox One store.

1396
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:17,000
Just as with Xbox Live indie game XBLIG. I'm going to call it XBLIG because it's fun.

1397
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:21,000
Games published on the service will not be allowed to have achievement.

1398
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:29,000
As far as peer review, nothing has been announced yet regarding this, but I have a hard time believing there will be no peer review or final approval of any kind.

1399
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:34,000
Otherwise, games can be released with crash bugs, inappropriate content, copyrighted material, etc.

1400
02:01:35,000 --> 02:01:37,000
I have a feeling there will be something.

1401
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:40,000
XBLIG. It's just funny calling it XBLIG.

1402
02:01:41,000 --> 02:01:43,000
Titles were allowed to have Xbox Live multiplayer features.

1403
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:47,000
Interestingly, titles published through this new program will not.

1404
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:52,000
Games featuring online multiplayer will have to be published via ID at Xbox instead.

1405
02:01:53,000 --> 02:01:57,000
However, one Xbox Live feature we will now have access to is leaderboards.

1406
02:01:58,000 --> 02:02:01,000
XBLIG previously did not allow these.

1407
02:02:01,000 --> 02:02:06,000
Having a portfolio consist mostly of arcade style games makes this relevant to my interests.

1408
02:02:07,000 --> 02:02:14,000
One major difference this time is that Microsoft is not giving a specific development software as they did with XNA last time.

1409
02:02:15,000 --> 02:02:20,000
To create these games, we can use anything that can produce UWP or Universal Windows Platform apps.

1410
02:02:21,000 --> 02:02:23,000
This includes frameworks like Unity and MonoGame.

1411
02:02:24,000 --> 02:02:27,000
MonoGame, by the way, is an open source replacement for XNA.

1412
02:02:28,000 --> 02:02:31,000
Porting XNA games to MonoGame generally takes a negligible amount of time.

1413
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:35,000
So XBLIG ports are definitely going to be a thing.

1414
02:02:36,000 --> 02:02:39,000
I have already ported several of my own games to the MonoGame framework.

1415
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:42,000
There's no need to recreate them or reinvent the wheel.

1416
02:02:43,000 --> 02:02:47,000
Speaking of those games, it is too early to make any announcements.

1417
02:02:48,000 --> 02:02:52,000
I can't even get into the program yet, but I guarantee you we'll see bungee ferret tossing again.

1418
02:02:53,000 --> 02:02:57,000
Maybe with added construction cranes and more ninjas. And more blood. A lot more blood.

1419
02:02:58,000 --> 02:02:59,000
We have to use that extra blood.

1420
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:01,000
And nudity.

1421
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:03,000
They just need to be random boobs.

1422
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:06,000
Although, sadly, nudity would probably get him booted from the program.

1423
02:03:07,000 --> 02:03:11,000
He can put as much fake pixel blood as he wants in there, but the minute somebody in the background is like,

1424
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:17,000
I love you ferret, and whips her tits out, it's going to get declined in the peer review.

1425
02:03:18,000 --> 02:03:21,000
We just need to have a space where that can go.

1426
02:03:21,000 --> 02:03:26,000
I understand that usually when you think of nudity, it's like adult games.

1427
02:03:27,000 --> 02:03:31,000
But I want, like, why can't we just have a decent game that also has nudity?

1428
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:36,000
If nothing else, ladies in white bikinis, and men in white bikinis too, to be fair,

1429
02:03:37,000 --> 02:03:39,000
because we're equal opportunity here, shooting each other with squirt guns in the background.

1430
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:42,000
Because at least you know that's okay.

1431
02:03:45,000 --> 02:03:48,000
A lot more blood, and we have to use that extra power somehow, right?

1432
02:03:49,000 --> 02:03:50,000
Please look forward to it.

1433
02:03:51,000 --> 02:03:53,000
I'm probably still heading home from round one while you're reading this,

1434
02:03:54,000 --> 02:03:56,000
but if you have more questions, I'll hear them out on the podcast.

1435
02:03:57,000 --> 02:03:59,000
Have a great week, Erin Yyr.

1436
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:05,000
And moving on to the next email, if we're ready.

1437
02:04:06,000 --> 02:04:08,000
Hey, OLR crew, AZHP here.

1438
02:04:09,000 --> 02:04:13,000
On last week's show, you all mentioned that people should complain to the Better Business Bureau

1439
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:16,000
when Amazon did not fulfill their launch day delivery switch promises.

1440
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:20,000
While I'm all for consumer protection, the Better Business Bureau is not necessarily the best place to go

1441
02:04:21,000 --> 02:04:23,000
when that protection is necessary.

1442
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:27,000
The reason for this is that the BBB is not actually any sort of governing entity,

1443
02:04:28,000 --> 02:04:31,000
but is basically a more official sounding Yelp, long before Yelp was a thing.

1444
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:36,000
However, since the popular belief is that the BBB has some kind of authority,

1445
02:04:37,000 --> 02:04:40,000
BBB used this as leverage to make companies pay them to increase their rating.

1446
02:04:41,000 --> 02:04:45,000
It's extremely devious, and basically the business equivalent of the infamous

1447
02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:49,000
engagement ring must be two months salary, marketing campaign,

1448
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:53,000
originated by DBears, which is so ingrained in the public consciousness

1449
02:04:54,000 --> 02:04:57,000
that people believe it to be an infallible rule.

1450
02:04:58,000 --> 02:05:06,000
I will also point out offhand, though, that having that review does reflect on the business,

1451
02:05:07,000 --> 02:05:08,000
so I'll go ahead and keep going.

1452
02:05:09,000 --> 02:05:11,000
Honestly, the best thing you can do in this case as a consumer

1453
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:14,000
is that if you were affected, complain to Amazon's customer service.

1454
02:05:14,000 --> 02:05:16,000
You'll probably get a month extension on your Prime membership,

1455
02:05:17,000 --> 02:05:20,000
and a 10% refund on your order. $30 is nothing to sneeze at.

1456
02:05:21,000 --> 02:05:23,000
Meanwhile, I'm enjoying Zelda on my Wii U.

1457
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:30,000
Sure, it's only 720p, but the framerate is the same as the game is on Switch in console mode,

1458
02:05:31,000 --> 02:05:34,000
although the portable mode apparently runs at a higher framerate.

1459
02:05:35,000 --> 02:05:39,000
I can explain this in a future email if you're interested in the technical details.

1460
02:05:39,000 --> 02:05:47,000
Sure, I can't play it on the Bart going to work or on my lunch break,

1461
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:53,000
but I didn't have to purchase or anxiously wait for another console to arrive in time for me to play it.

1462
02:05:54,000 --> 02:05:55,000
You're truly AZHP.

1463
02:05:56,000 --> 02:06:00,000
That's fascinating about the Better Business Bureau, and I honestly didn't know that,

1464
02:06:01,000 --> 02:06:04,000
especially the whole fact that it's just basically an old-school type of Yelp service.

1465
02:06:05,000 --> 02:06:08,000
I understand every time I read Yelp, I'm only going to see the bad stuff,

1466
02:06:09,000 --> 02:06:13,000
and the good stuff is probably a question mark, because it's probably the friends and relatives that wrote that,

1467
02:06:14,000 --> 02:06:16,000
and then people only go on that site to write reviews and they have problems,

1468
02:06:17,000 --> 02:06:18,000
so I understand there's issues with Yelp.

1469
02:06:19,000 --> 02:06:21,000
But the whole thing with Better Business Bureau, I thought there was a thing where you,

1470
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:23,000
and I'm actually seeing it in chat, too.

1471
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:27,000
SG100Matt says, the thing about BBB is that businesses have to respond to any claim against it.

1472
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:33,000
If they have no power when it comes to governing or whatever, how does a business have to respond to it?

1473
02:06:33,000 --> 02:06:39,000
Or is that the whole, I guess, like, gotcha with the money thing that he's kind of referencing there?

1474
02:06:40,000 --> 02:06:42,000
Well, it's like SEO, you know, if you don't respond to it, it's still your name of your business,

1475
02:06:43,000 --> 02:06:45,000
and it shows up in a source that people think is reputable.

1476
02:06:46,000 --> 02:06:49,000
Which is kind of the same strong army that Yelp does, which is kind of making them controversial in a way.

1477
02:06:50,000 --> 02:06:55,000
Well, that's fascinating, but I just, here's the thing, so, okay, so you know something I didn't there about that,

1478
02:06:56,000 --> 02:07:00,000
so thank you for sharing about that, but I just, I kind of disagree when it's the whole,

1479
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:06,000
well, then the only avenue is to go to Amazon customer service and accept the pitillants that they give you,

1480
02:07:07,000 --> 02:07:10,000
you know, a month free of their own service type of thing.

1481
02:07:11,000 --> 02:07:15,000
It's kind of one of those things where it's like, all I really wanted in this scenario,

1482
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:18,000
and honestly, I haven't checked in the past week to see if this has happened,

1483
02:07:19,000 --> 02:07:21,000
so I'm going to just say that up front. I don't know if this happened.

1484
02:07:22,000 --> 02:07:27,000
ActDeft, I know you got screwed by Amazon, so I'm curious if you got this.

1485
02:07:27,000 --> 02:07:33,000
Did Amazon, like, accept responsibility and apologize in that?

1486
02:07:34,000 --> 02:07:36,000
Did they accept responsibility and apologize?

1487
02:07:37,000 --> 02:07:41,000
I don't mean some person in customer service that's paid to do that on every single call.

1488
02:07:42,000 --> 02:07:47,000
Did the corporation accept responsibility and apologize and tell us how it's not going to happen again,

1489
02:07:48,000 --> 02:07:50,000
and what they're going to do different next time?

1490
02:07:51,000 --> 02:07:53,000
That's what I'm curious about. ActDeft in chat says not really, no.

1491
02:07:53,000 --> 02:07:57,000
That's the only thing I really want in this scenario, I think,

1492
02:07:58,000 --> 02:08:01,000
you know, is that Amazon needs to have their feet held to the fire a little bit

1493
02:08:02,000 --> 02:08:05,000
before we consider purchasing another system through them in the future.

1494
02:08:06,000 --> 02:08:09,000
I mean, disclosure, sorry, just disclosure, I had no issue with Amazon.

1495
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:13,000
I got my switch through them, and I had no issue, but I understand a lot of other people did,

1496
02:08:14,000 --> 02:08:19,000
and so I think that's messed up for the people that also did the same thing I did. Sorry, Judy.

1497
02:08:19,000 --> 02:08:23,000
I was just going to say, I think that given how huge a company Amazon is,

1498
02:08:24,000 --> 02:08:26,000
they may not even care if it makes them look bad, you know?

1499
02:08:27,000 --> 02:08:29,000
I don't expect them to put anything out about this.

1500
02:08:30,000 --> 02:08:32,000
I kind of always thought that wasn't the case with Amazon, though,

1501
02:08:33,000 --> 02:08:35,000
that they were very, like, customer service oriented,

1502
02:08:36,000 --> 02:08:38,000
because don't they own that shoe site, Zappos or whatever?

1503
02:08:39,000 --> 02:08:40,000
I think they bought them.

1504
02:08:41,000 --> 02:08:43,000
Zappos is a huge thing as customer service.

1505
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:45,000
That's like a huge thing for Zappos.

1506
02:08:46,000 --> 02:08:47,000
Right, but Amazon is like the everything store now.

1507
02:08:47,000 --> 02:08:49,000
Like maybe 10 years ago they would have cared, but now, I mean,

1508
02:08:50,000 --> 02:08:54,000
they just have so many different things that I don't think it's a big deal to them.

1509
02:08:55,000 --> 02:08:57,000
But don't forget, everything we said at the top of the show,

1510
02:08:58,000 --> 02:09:01,000
everything we said at the top of the show this week about Twitch and Amazon Company.

1511
02:09:02,000 --> 02:09:03,000
Alright.

1512
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:06,000
Something to think about. Anyway, thank you very much for the email.

1513
02:09:07,000 --> 02:09:10,000
And all the emails, that was it tonight, yes?

1514
02:09:11,000 --> 02:09:15,000
Participate at orangelauntrader.com if you would like to email us in the future.

1515
02:09:15,000 --> 02:09:17,000
In the meantime, we still have some news to catch up on

1516
02:09:18,000 --> 02:09:21,000
before we get to your calls at Orange Lounge Radio. Loki.

1517
02:09:22,000 --> 02:09:26,000
Alright. So, No Man's Sky's getting an update.

1518
02:09:27,000 --> 02:09:29,000
And No Man Cares.

1519
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:33,000
I haven't played it even before the last update, so.

1520
02:09:34,000 --> 02:09:37,000
Well, here's the thing. You know how PlayStation 4 got that boost mode this week?

1521
02:09:38,000 --> 02:09:41,000
Okay, so it doesn't do anything for Overwatch, but I wasn't expecting it to,

1522
02:09:42,000 --> 02:09:43,000
because I think Overwatch was after the pro was out anyway.

1523
02:09:43,000 --> 02:09:45,000
But I heard that No Man's Sky...

1524
02:09:46,000 --> 02:09:47,000
No Overwatch wasn't when the pro was out?

1525
02:09:48,000 --> 02:09:51,000
Well, I thought it supported the pro, but only like 4K menus.

1526
02:09:52,000 --> 02:09:54,000
It doesn't really enhance the game. Anyway, that stuff aside,

1527
02:09:55,000 --> 02:09:58,000
I heard that No Man's Sky gets a boost out of this boost mode,

1528
02:09:59,000 --> 02:10:02,000
so I do want to go back and check out that game now that boost mode is a thing.

1529
02:10:03,000 --> 02:10:09,000
I haven't tried playing Final Fantasy XV, I'm feeling a little shafted on this pro thing.

1530
02:10:10,000 --> 02:10:12,000
How about XIV? Oh, you don't play XIV on PS4 though?

1531
02:10:13,000 --> 02:10:17,000
But I heard that XIV also got a boost from this, so I guess I need to go back and check out that one.

1532
02:10:18,000 --> 02:10:19,000
So, anyway.

1533
02:10:20,000 --> 02:10:25,000
Anyway, so the Pathfinder update was a new update that's coming out,

1534
02:10:26,000 --> 02:10:30,000
and it's, I guess, some of the updates along with that.

1535
02:10:31,000 --> 02:10:37,000
On the PC version, it's going to allow players to share bases online through the online Steam workshop,

1536
02:10:37,000 --> 02:10:44,000
and also letting other people use and discover those bases and customize outposts.

1537
02:10:45,000 --> 02:10:49,000
Also, there's an Exocraft vehicle that's coming.

1538
02:10:50,000 --> 02:10:55,000
So, can you drive that?

1539
02:10:56,000 --> 02:10:58,000
That's what it sounds like. It sounds like it's a little moon buggy type of thing,

1540
02:10:59,000 --> 02:11:02,000
like the Mako in Mass Effect, but hopefully more drivable.

1541
02:11:02,000 --> 02:11:09,000
That's pretty cool. And then they said also that there's going to be ground, I guess, with a ground transport,

1542
02:11:10,000 --> 02:11:14,000
are going to be able to, that's one of the things that's coming with the ground transports,

1543
02:11:15,000 --> 02:11:18,000
and then you can also mine the store resources with the bases.

1544
02:11:19,000 --> 02:11:27,000
They're supposed to be adding a photo mode and improving the visuals for 4K on the PlayStation 4 Pro,

1545
02:11:27,000 --> 02:11:38,000
and better rail solutions on the PlayStation 4 and PC, including a permadeath mode, multi-tool specializations, and ship classes.

1546
02:11:39,000 --> 02:11:41,000
I'll tell you what, I'll play this game when they're done patching it.

1547
02:11:42,000 --> 02:11:49,000
I mean, like, I think I'll just start over, because I don't remember what I was doing, and fuck if I care anyways.

1548
02:11:50,000 --> 02:11:53,000
I'll start over when it's fun to play again.

1549
02:11:53,000 --> 02:12:01,000
Like, it's not just this inventory management hell, which I think it's gotten better, but it'll be nice, there'll be a whole new game again.

1550
02:12:02,000 --> 02:12:03,000
So you're saying, wake me up when the final version's out.

1551
02:12:04,000 --> 02:12:08,000
Exactly. Wake me up when the game of the year, okay, when it's complete edition.

1552
02:12:09,000 --> 02:12:13,000
Well, yeah, and to Hello Games' credit, they're not charging for any of this.

1553
02:12:14,000 --> 02:12:15,000
Yeah, exactly.

1554
02:12:16,000 --> 02:12:17,000
Because, oh my god, I can't even imagine.

1555
02:12:18,000 --> 02:12:19,000
It was a $60 game, they better not be fucking charged for any of this.

1556
02:12:19,000 --> 02:12:21,000
I can't even imagine the tweets they'd be getting if they were.

1557
02:12:22,000 --> 02:12:24,000
That would be very upsetting.

1558
02:12:25,000 --> 02:12:31,000
Alright, well good luck to them in putting that game together, and who knows, maybe they can turn it around like Diablo 3 got turned around.

1559
02:12:32,000 --> 02:12:36,000
If they fix Diablo 3 in the original Final Fantasy XIV, anything's possible.

1560
02:12:37,000 --> 02:12:44,000
Anyhow, Final Fantasy VII Remake, hopefully that's a good game when it comes out, but y'all better be ready for some changes.

1561
02:12:44,000 --> 02:13:00,000
This probably isn't going to surprise anybody, but Tetsuya Nomura mentioned in an interview with Famitsu this week that showed off some new Final Fantasy VII Remake screenshots, there will not be the battle system that you're used to in the original. That's gone.

1562
02:13:01,000 --> 02:13:03,000
Of course not, because they ripped the whole engine from XV.

1563
02:13:03,000 --> 02:13:14,000
Yeah, they don't confirm that, and they don't really talk about what the system is that's replacing it, but I mean, you look at these screenshots, it's like this was built in XV's engine very, very clearly.

1564
02:13:15,000 --> 02:13:29,000
It was, and even the stupid, remember in the whole shimmying along the little narrow wall areas and stuff like that, they have the same animation in the VII demo video thing that they add online.

1565
02:13:29,000 --> 02:13:36,000
So it's obviously in the XV engine, that's why they're not there, it's like, fuck, we don't want to implement a new battle system, we'll just use the one we fucking have.

1566
02:13:37,000 --> 02:13:46,000
What's worrying me about this is that it talks about how there's cover, and in an explanation, this is coming through a translation however, but in an explanation Nomura said,

1567
02:13:46,000 --> 02:13:55,000
in the story, in situations where you're sneaking around, you won't just be able to march down the middle of the path. The original version had random encounters, and such parts were in the realm of imagination.

1568
02:13:56,000 --> 02:14:05,000
But since this title is seamless, and you see the path that you're infiltrating, I decided it was necessary for the sake of realism. So you have stealth type of things instead of random encounters.

1569
02:14:05,000 --> 02:14:16,000
That sounds fucking awful, especially considering how chapter 13 in Final Fantasy XV turned out, which, spoiler alert, heavily involved stealth. And it was awful.

1570
02:14:17,000 --> 02:14:34,000
So, this concerns me big time. However, seeing as we only have a couple screenshots to go off of, and a translated quote, I'll give this a benefit of the doubt, I'm not going to come out and say, worst game ever, I'm over it, fuck it, you know, I'm not going to say any of that.

1571
02:14:35,000 --> 02:14:47,000
Just, I have concerns that I hope will be alleviated when there is a demo for this game, or some type of something more playable, which I'm imagining will have to be this year's E3, we'll really start to see more about this.

1572
02:14:48,000 --> 02:14:50,000
Well didn't they fix chapter 13, or are they going to fix chapter 13?

1573
02:14:51,000 --> 02:14:53,000
I think it is dated around the Gladio DLC release.

1574
02:14:54,000 --> 02:15:02,000
So maybe if they're fixing whatever the problem was, then they're going to fix it for this, or I don't know what exactly they're fixing, because I still haven't played past chapter 1.

1575
02:15:02,000 --> 02:15:19,000
Let's hope. Let's hope. So, anyway, I do want to say that also it was pointed out that you could just run into enemies and fight them if you prefer, but Barret can use cover as well, there's a special element in Gunners, but they're not saying anything on it yet.

1576
02:15:20,000 --> 02:15:29,000
There's also a screenshot out there of Cloud and Barret actually fighting the first boss in the game, which is, you know, you might remember from the original Final Fantasy VII, but it's totally different now, everything is different.

1577
02:15:29,000 --> 02:15:43,000
So, are they still, are they actually going to release this game as Final Fantasy VII Remake? Is that the actual name they're going to put on the box and sell it as? That's a weird name to me. Why don't they just call it Final Fantasy VII, or Reimagined or something?

1578
02:15:44,000 --> 02:15:54,000
Or Alterna VII. Or just 2017 edition, I don't know, it's weird to me. By the way, I'll just mention it here, because I thought I had it elsewhere on the show, but I don't see it.

1579
02:15:54,000 --> 02:16:14,000
Final Fantasy XII, they've been talking about that at PAX a little bit, and there are some special editions going up on sale right now. The Super Hela Mega Special Edition actually comes with Judge Busts, little metal busts of some of the judges in the game, which you might remember are kind of the antagonists in the game.

1580
02:16:14,000 --> 02:16:31,000
So, yeah. I mean, if you want to spend $200 on the Uber Special Limited Edition of Final Fantasy XII, you can get that, but I think I'll just take that regular one that's in a tin, thanks. But I'm super looking forward to Final Fantasy XII. Really looking forward to that. Anyhow, DarkSakura, what do you have for us?

1581
02:16:32,000 --> 02:16:43,000
Well, there's some news about Breath of the Wild. The whole reason that Link isn't wearing his little pointy hat, anyone want to guess why? It didn't look good.

1582
02:16:43,000 --> 02:17:05,000
It basically said, and this is the quote from Satoru Takazawa, as the graphic fidelity has increased, it becomes more difficult to make that hat look cool. As the game becomes more realistic, it's difficult to present it in a way that's appealing. So basically, it made him look like a big dork. Although there is a way to get it.

1583
02:17:05,000 --> 02:17:10,000
I was going to say, I thought somebody had shared on Twitter, like they had an outfit where they had the pointy hat.

1584
02:17:10,000 --> 02:17:16,000
You have to beat, well to get other parts of it, you have to beat all 120 shrines.

1585
02:17:16,000 --> 02:17:18,000
That's a lot.

1586
02:17:18,000 --> 02:17:21,000
We've maybe done like 50.

1587
02:17:21,000 --> 02:17:23,000
I'm like, have I even found 12?

1588
02:17:23,000 --> 02:17:26,000
Some of them are really close to each other too.

1589
02:17:26,000 --> 02:17:31,000
Stop having stupid rewards for really hard challenges, is what I'm saying.

1590
02:17:31,000 --> 02:17:33,000
They're not that hard.

1591
02:17:33,000 --> 02:17:36,000
I feel like a costume throwback is not a stupid reward.

1592
02:17:37,000 --> 02:17:43,000
It goes like, was it the metal skin, the gold Mario for being, it's like that's stupid.

1593
02:17:43,000 --> 02:17:46,000
You know what would be a great reward is a weapon that doesn't break.

1594
02:17:46,000 --> 02:17:48,000
That will happen.

1595
02:17:48,000 --> 02:17:50,000
The master sword apparently.

1596
02:17:50,000 --> 02:17:52,000
The master sword.

1597
02:17:53,000 --> 02:17:57,000
The royal claymore and the royal bow, those have been really good.

1598
02:17:57,000 --> 02:18:02,000
But we kind of skipped the Gerudo part. Not the Gerudo part, we've skipped the Goron part.

1599
02:18:02,000 --> 02:18:07,000
Or as we've been calling them, the Morons, the Gorgonzola. We've come up with all kinds of names.

1600
02:18:07,000 --> 02:18:12,000
We figured that the Gorons and the Zoras were once a race called the Gorgonzolas.

1601
02:18:12,000 --> 02:18:14,000
So anyway.

1602
02:18:14,000 --> 02:18:19,000
You know that this has the cartridges. I wonder if they can do like a Game Genie pro-action replay type thing with it.

1603
02:18:19,000 --> 02:18:21,000
Doubt it.

1604
02:18:21,000 --> 02:18:25,000
What I was saying is we're now where the bird people are.

1605
02:18:25,000 --> 02:18:29,000
And it's actually interesting. We go into different parts and get things that help you with other parts.

1606
02:18:29,000 --> 02:18:31,000
So just the interplay is pretty awesome.

1607
02:18:31,000 --> 02:18:34,000
I'm where the water people are. That's what I'm doing right now.

1608
02:18:34,000 --> 02:18:36,000
Yeah, that part was cool.

1609
02:18:36,000 --> 02:18:38,000
You're at the heffalump.

1610
02:18:38,000 --> 02:18:40,000
Yes.

1611
02:18:40,000 --> 02:18:47,000
Also, I do see the screenshots floating around Twitter of where I guess if you were Link and you walk up to the edge of a bridge or whatever.

1612
02:18:47,000 --> 02:18:52,000
Somebody walking on the bridge will actually tell you, don't do it. There's a lot to live for and all this stuff.

1613
02:18:52,000 --> 02:18:56,000
There's so many little intricacies in the game.

1614
02:18:56,000 --> 02:19:00,000
Was it the dog where if you run in circles next to a dog, the dog will chase its tail?

1615
02:19:00,000 --> 02:19:02,000
Yeah, the dog will chase its tail.

1616
02:19:02,000 --> 02:19:05,000
There's just little ridiculous things that are what make this game so great.

1617
02:19:05,000 --> 02:19:12,000
Get this. Pick up a cuckoo. The chickens go out in front of an enemy.

1618
02:19:12,000 --> 02:19:14,000
I saw this. I saw that GIF on Twitter.

1619
02:19:14,000 --> 02:19:15,000
I haven't seen it.

1620
02:19:15,000 --> 02:19:17,000
The chicken barrage comes back.

1621
02:19:17,000 --> 02:19:23,000
But you get it to attack the enemy. You throw the chicken in front of the enemy when it attacks the enemy.

1622
02:19:23,000 --> 02:19:25,000
You have to hold the chicken while it attacks you.

1623
02:19:25,000 --> 02:19:29,000
And when it hits the chicken, all of its chicken buddies come out and beat the shit out of it.

1624
02:19:29,000 --> 02:19:31,000
And it will kill a Hinox.

1625
02:19:31,000 --> 02:19:32,000
Nice.

1626
02:19:32,000 --> 02:19:33,000
That's pretty cool.

1627
02:19:33,000 --> 02:19:35,000
I can see that they're in a Ganon fight.

1628
02:19:35,000 --> 02:19:38,000
Can I use the chicken to beat Ganon? That would be awesome.

1629
02:19:38,000 --> 02:19:39,000
That would be great.

1630
02:19:39,000 --> 02:19:41,000
Excuse me, Calamity Ganon.

1631
02:19:41,000 --> 02:19:46,000
Well, at this point though, I may have to excuse myself.

1632
02:19:46,000 --> 02:19:47,000
Sure.

1633
02:19:47,000 --> 02:19:51,000
Because I am still recovering, as you can hear in my voice.

1634
02:19:51,000 --> 02:19:52,000
Yep.

1635
02:19:52,000 --> 02:19:56,000
So I would like to bid our listeners a fond adieu for the evening.

1636
02:19:56,000 --> 02:19:58,000
Farewell, DarkSakura. Thank you for being here.

1637
02:19:58,000 --> 02:19:59,000
Thank you for having me.

1638
02:19:59,000 --> 02:20:01,000
Do you have any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?

1639
02:20:01,000 --> 02:20:02,000
Resist.

1640
02:20:02,000 --> 02:20:05,000
Alright. Feel better, and we'll see you in seven days.

1641
02:20:05,000 --> 02:20:06,000
Thank you.

1642
02:20:06,000 --> 02:20:07,000
Awesome.

1643
02:20:07,000 --> 02:20:11,000
Alright, well, while DarkSakura decides to head out for the evening to take care of herself,

1644
02:20:11,000 --> 02:20:14,000
we're going to move on with just a couple more stories for you guys here. Loki.

1645
02:20:14,000 --> 02:20:21,000
So, Pokemon Go has hinted to have, actually, the legendary Pokemon starting to appear later this year.

1646
02:20:21,000 --> 02:20:24,000
Or at least it's been hinted at several times before.

1647
02:20:24,000 --> 02:20:30,000
But now, with an interview with John Hank of Niantic,

1648
02:20:30,000 --> 02:20:35,000
basically said, I can safely say we'll see more of it this year.

1649
02:20:35,000 --> 02:20:38,000
Which could be, you know, more new Pokemon.

1650
02:20:38,000 --> 02:20:44,000
Apparently it was out of a German article that was regarding the legendary Pokemon, but...

1651
02:20:44,000 --> 02:20:48,000
Or it could just be a fucking cock tease so they don't have any fucking plans whatsoever for you.

1652
02:20:48,000 --> 02:20:51,000
Well, see more announcements of it later this year, yes.

1653
02:20:51,000 --> 02:20:53,000
I can see it now.

1654
02:20:53,000 --> 02:20:56,000
Look, I do like Niantic a lot.

1655
02:20:56,000 --> 02:20:58,000
I've lost a lot of fucking free time to Ingress.

1656
02:20:58,000 --> 02:21:01,000
A lot of fucking free time to Ingress.

1657
02:21:01,000 --> 02:21:03,000
And now Pokemon Go.

1658
02:21:03,000 --> 02:21:05,000
I don't even play Ingress as much as I used to.

1659
02:21:05,000 --> 02:21:07,000
Now Ingress is one of those things where it's like,

1660
02:21:07,000 --> 02:21:10,000
Oh, there's a field over my house, I guess I should go fuck it up.

1661
02:21:10,000 --> 02:21:12,000
You know, that's my Ingress playing now.

1662
02:21:12,000 --> 02:21:15,000
Pokemon Go, I still kind of roll with that.

1663
02:21:15,000 --> 02:21:19,000
And I still get pissed off at all these memes that are like,

1664
02:21:19,000 --> 02:21:21,000
No one plays Pokemon Go or no one cares about Pokemon Go.

1665
02:21:21,000 --> 02:21:24,000
Because I probably do more walking because of Pokemon Go.

1666
02:21:24,000 --> 02:21:28,000
But I can say that and at the same time still go.

1667
02:21:28,000 --> 02:21:32,000
It is really like kind of bullshit some of the things Niantic is doing with this whole like,

1668
02:21:32,000 --> 02:21:34,000
you know, the legendary still aren't in the game.

1669
02:21:34,000 --> 02:21:37,000
They don't seem to be doing any type of live events or any of this stuff.

1670
02:21:37,000 --> 02:21:40,000
And I get they got to space things out to make things more exciting,

1671
02:21:40,000 --> 02:21:43,000
but they have, oh, five more generations worth of Pokemon

1672
02:21:43,000 --> 02:21:47,000
that they're still going to be like teasing over the next years and years and years to be working with.

1673
02:21:47,000 --> 02:21:49,000
So, I don't know.

1674
02:21:49,000 --> 02:21:51,000
SSG100Matt in chat says,

1675
02:21:51,000 --> 02:21:53,000
Speaking of which, I need to cash out of gyms right now.

1676
02:21:53,000 --> 02:21:57,000
Yeah, that's the thing that I would like Niantic to kind of work on is like make the gym interesting.

1677
02:21:57,000 --> 02:22:01,000
Like it's the gym game is stupid right now. It's really stupid.

1678
02:22:01,000 --> 02:22:02,000
All it is...

1679
02:22:02,000 --> 02:22:03,000
It's like no point.

1680
02:22:03,000 --> 02:22:05,000
It's Rhyhorn's, Vaporeon's, Blissey's.

1681
02:22:05,000 --> 02:22:07,000
Uh, what else? What am I missing?

1682
02:22:07,000 --> 02:22:08,000
Gyrodos.

1683
02:22:08,000 --> 02:22:09,000
Snorlax.

1684
02:22:09,000 --> 02:22:10,000
Snorlax.

1685
02:22:10,000 --> 02:22:11,000
Then that's it.

1686
02:22:11,000 --> 02:22:12,000
Lapras maybe?

1687
02:22:12,000 --> 02:22:14,000
Maybe Lapras or one of, no, Lapras got nerfed.

1688
02:22:14,000 --> 02:22:15,000
Dragonite's.

1689
02:22:15,000 --> 02:22:16,000
Okay, Dragonite's. That's it.

1690
02:22:16,000 --> 02:22:21,000
So, my point is out of the now 250 Pokemon in this game,

1691
02:22:21,000 --> 02:22:26,000
it's the same fucking 10, and that's being generous because it's really more like 6,

1692
02:22:26,000 --> 02:22:29,000
but it's the same fucking 10 that are always the ones that take gyms.

1693
02:22:29,000 --> 02:22:31,000
Just wait until we get legendaries.

1694
02:22:31,000 --> 02:22:32,000
Ugh.

1695
02:22:32,000 --> 02:22:33,000
Ugh.

1696
02:22:33,000 --> 02:22:34,000
Ugh.

1697
02:22:34,000 --> 02:22:35,000
Ugh.

1698
02:22:35,000 --> 02:22:37,000
Anyway, it's just, it's not interesting.

1699
02:22:37,000 --> 02:22:38,000
That's the thing.

1700
02:22:38,000 --> 02:22:41,000
So, that's why, but I'm not really super getting into the gym game,

1701
02:22:41,000 --> 02:22:48,000
but it's like, well, I would like to have all that fucking gold so I can buy things like, you know, incubators would be great.

1702
02:22:48,000 --> 02:22:49,000
Anyway.

1703
02:22:49,000 --> 02:22:51,000
Teddy Ursa. I saw a Teddy Ursa on a gym.

1704
02:22:51,000 --> 02:22:52,000
Teddy Ursa?

1705
02:22:52,000 --> 02:22:53,000
Not a Teddy Ursa, the Ursa.

1706
02:22:53,000 --> 02:22:54,000
Ursa Ring.

1707
02:22:54,000 --> 02:22:55,000
Yeah.

1708
02:22:55,000 --> 02:22:56,000
I saw one of those on a gym.

1709
02:22:56,000 --> 02:22:57,000
But that was a new-

1710
02:22:57,000 --> 02:22:58,000
For like a hot minute.

1711
02:22:58,000 --> 02:23:00,000
Who didn't know what they were putting down, or they were putting it down to Prestige.

1712
02:23:00,000 --> 02:23:01,000
It was pretty buff.

1713
02:23:01,000 --> 02:23:02,000
Prestige the gym.

1714
02:23:02,000 --> 02:23:04,000
Ursa Ring is up there in stats.

1715
02:23:04,000 --> 02:23:06,000
It's not like the best, but it's not bad either.

1716
02:23:06,000 --> 02:23:07,000
Yeah.

1717
02:23:07,000 --> 02:23:08,000
You can buff them pretty well.

1718
02:23:08,000 --> 02:23:09,000
Alright.

1719
02:23:09,000 --> 02:23:11,000
That's my last tidbit before I go.

1720
02:23:11,000 --> 02:23:14,000
Hey, by the way, since I'm reading, piggybacking off of something I see in chat,

1721
02:23:14,000 --> 02:23:18,000
can we call you, like, can we change your name from Dark Sakura to Calamity Jamie?

1722
02:23:19,000 --> 02:23:21,000
I like that name.

1723
02:23:21,000 --> 02:23:23,000
That is pretty good.

1724
02:23:23,000 --> 02:23:24,000
Calamity Jamie.

1725
02:23:24,000 --> 02:23:25,000
That's my sub, Nick.

1726
02:23:28,000 --> 02:23:29,000
That's the remix edition.

1727
02:23:29,000 --> 02:23:30,000
Alright.

1728
02:23:30,000 --> 02:23:32,000
Calamity Jamie's on her way out for the night.

1729
02:23:32,000 --> 02:23:34,000
Have a good one. Feel better.

1730
02:23:34,000 --> 02:23:37,000
I'm gonna do a bunch of not talking, except when I yell at Dan for going the wrong way.

1731
02:23:37,000 --> 02:23:39,000
Well, try not to yell so loud.

1732
02:23:39,000 --> 02:23:40,000
Bye.

1733
02:23:40,000 --> 02:23:41,000
Alright. Bye-bye.

1734
02:23:41,000 --> 02:23:44,000
And last but not least tonight, before we open up the Skype line at Orange Lounge Radio,

1735
02:23:45,000 --> 02:23:49,000
I know a lot of you will be very excited to hear about a new Steven Universe game.

1736
02:23:49,000 --> 02:23:50,000
That's right.

1737
02:23:50,000 --> 02:23:53,000
Steven Universe Save the Light is going to be coming out this summer.

1738
02:23:53,000 --> 02:23:56,000
It's a sequel to Attack the Light.

1739
02:23:56,000 --> 02:23:58,000
This time it is Save the Light.

1740
02:23:58,000 --> 02:24:02,000
This time, though, the game will be out on consoles, not phones.

1741
02:24:02,000 --> 02:24:04,000
So Attack the Light was out on phones.

1742
02:24:04,000 --> 02:24:05,000
It was a mobile RPG.

1743
02:24:05,000 --> 02:24:08,000
This one is actually gonna be something that's available on consoles.

1744
02:24:08,000 --> 02:24:11,000
There'll be an updated battle system, fully customizable character selection,

1745
02:24:11,000 --> 02:24:14,000
more emphasis on exploration and puzzle solving in 3D environments,

1746
02:24:14,000 --> 02:24:20,000
and an all-new story from Rebecca Sugar and this team behind Steven Universe.

1747
02:24:20,000 --> 02:24:22,000
This game was shown at PAX East.

1748
02:24:22,000 --> 02:24:26,000
They even did a whole little panel on Saturday at 10 a.m.

1749
02:24:26,000 --> 02:24:27,000
However, I wasn't there.

1750
02:24:27,000 --> 02:24:32,000
But maybe somebody here was and wants to give us a call and talk about PAX East.

1751
02:24:32,000 --> 02:24:38,000
Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype, is the place to call if you'd like to give us a call and say hello.

1752
02:24:38,000 --> 02:24:39,000
Let's get to the Skype line.

1753
02:24:39,000 --> 02:24:40,000
We got a call coming in right now.

1754
02:24:40,000 --> 02:24:42,000
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

1755
02:24:42,000 --> 02:24:44,000
It's Raginator.

1756
02:24:44,000 --> 02:24:46,000
Hey, Raginator, it's been a while. What's on your mind, buddy?

1757
02:24:46,000 --> 02:24:48,000
No, hold on.

1758
02:24:48,000 --> 02:24:53,000
Sorry, I wasn't able to listen live last week, but...

1759
02:24:53,000 --> 02:24:58,000
Well, as long as you have a permission slip, we'll excuse you this once.

1760
02:24:58,000 --> 02:24:59,000
Yeah.

1761
02:24:59,000 --> 02:25:07,000
But anyway, the reason for my call, you know, I want to bring up two things real quick.

1762
02:25:07,000 --> 02:25:17,000
First, although it's a little too late for both the live listeners and those that may be listening on the podcast,

1763
02:25:17,000 --> 02:25:33,000
I just wanted to mention that GLG just recently had their spring sale, which ended at 7 p.m. Eastern, 4 p.m. Pacific.

1764
02:25:33,000 --> 02:25:35,000
Well, damn it, I just did.

1765
02:25:35,000 --> 02:25:47,000
Yeah, they had a lot of good stuff on sale, ranging from the Ultimate Games to Mirror's Edge,

1766
02:25:47,000 --> 02:25:55,000
some old LucasArts point-and-click adventure games, you name it.

1767
02:25:56,000 --> 02:26:04,000
Their entire library was on sale, but a good chunk of it was on sale nonetheless.

1768
02:26:04,000 --> 02:26:12,000
Well, I'm not sure when their sale could be starting. Probably not for a while.

1769
02:26:13,000 --> 02:26:23,000
But as a word of advice, just keep an eye on the site and try picking up some games.

1770
02:26:24,000 --> 02:26:40,000
I would definitely recommend GLG over Steam, if only for the reason that for the games that are on both Steam and GOG,

1771
02:26:40,000 --> 02:26:53,000
9 times out of 10, the GOG version will have the nice little added bonuses of having the soundtracks included or screensavers included.

1772
02:27:10,000 --> 02:27:19,000
Because I bought Covert Action and some stuff on GOG, you actually got PDF manuals and stuff that's really cool.

1773
02:27:40,000 --> 02:27:48,000
With Indiana Jones point-and-click adventure games, The Dig, and I forget what else.

1774
02:27:48,000 --> 02:28:04,000
Moving on to the second part of my call. Since the talk on tonight's episode of OR has been mostly RPG heavy, I thought I would pose this question.

1775
02:28:04,000 --> 02:28:21,000
What RPGs did you play over the years that really made you stop and think, huh, you know what?

1776
02:28:21,000 --> 02:28:37,000
I never really paid attention to RPGs before, never really cared for them, but this particular game or games makes the genre look interesting. I think it may stick with this genre.

1777
02:28:51,000 --> 02:29:02,000
Fuck, I even played Adventure on Atari 2600 and Sword Quest, which is interesting because I didn't transition from Dungeons and Dragons as a lot of people did.

1778
02:29:02,000 --> 02:29:12,000
I did play a little bit of D&D in high school, a little bit but not a lot of it. It was one of those things that would happen on a weekend every other month, there would be a sleepover or something.

1779
02:29:12,000 --> 02:29:33,000
I always enjoyed the RPGs. There was always a real story in them that you could get into. I think that became especially true with Final Fantasy 2, which obviously is 4 as we all know it as now, but it's going to be 2 for me on the Super Nintendo.

1780
02:29:33,000 --> 02:29:46,000
That was really the first one where it was like, OMG, it's not just the game elements where you have that progression and you feel your character level up and you get stronger and all this stuff, but it's like, OMG, the story is so freaking good.

1781
02:29:46,000 --> 02:29:56,000
I think that's when I was like, oh, I'm a fan of this type of series for life. And then Final Fantasy 2 just led into things like Secret of Mana, which was also an amazing game.

1782
02:29:57,000 --> 02:30:06,000
Chrono Trigger, I know we get into fun banters on this show about Chrono Trigger vs. Super Metroid, but at the end of the day, Chrono Trigger is still an amazing game, and it is.

1783
02:30:06,000 --> 02:30:19,000
And other RPGs that we get into PlayStation. For me, it goes all the way back. RPGs never really needed a chance. I kind of get where you're going with the question, where it's kind of like, what's the RPG that really sold you on it?

1784
02:30:19,000 --> 02:30:30,000
But I didn't need to be sold too. Loki, JD, was it the same for you guys? Or maybe you still don't like RPGs. I don't know. Loki, what about you?

1785
02:30:30,000 --> 02:30:32,000
I don't like RPGs.

1786
02:30:32,000 --> 02:30:35,000
I know you played enough Final Fantasy 11, you gotta like RPGs.

1787
02:30:35,000 --> 02:30:49,000
Yeah, I mean, I don't know. I just haven't played any really great ones. I mean, aside from Skyrim. I don't really pick up a whole lot of JRPGs or anything like that right now. It's more of just more open world games.

1788
02:30:49,000 --> 02:30:54,000
Skyrim's kind of a weird intersect, because I like sandbox-y open world games, and I like RPGs.

1789
02:30:54,000 --> 02:30:56,000
And she'll have a Grand Theft Auto.

1790
02:30:56,000 --> 02:31:03,000
Right, and so it's just like, boom. It's just like, okay, I like that. And then Fallout 4 is kind of like, hey, it's Skyrim, but it's futuristic.

1791
02:31:03,000 --> 02:31:07,000
You really need this new Zelda game. You really need the new Zelda game, Loki.

1792
02:31:07,000 --> 02:31:10,000
I will. I'll get it this week, but I just was waiting to get paid.

1793
02:31:10,000 --> 02:31:11,000
I know, I know.

1794
02:31:11,000 --> 02:31:14,000
So once Wednesday hits, yeah, I'll pick it up.

1795
02:31:14,000 --> 02:31:21,000
I'm just saying, knowing as much as you love open world stuff, this new Zelda thing, you're gonna eat it up.

1796
02:31:21,000 --> 02:31:23,000
JD, what about you and RPGs?

1797
02:31:23,000 --> 02:31:24,000
I mean, my first video games-

1798
02:31:24,000 --> 02:31:26,000
Don't forget to get a little closer to the mic there.

1799
02:31:26,000 --> 02:31:30,000
My first video games were Pokemon Red and Blue, so I got started with RPGs.

1800
02:31:30,000 --> 02:31:35,000
But, you know, as I've gotten older, I don't have the attention span for it anymore.

1801
02:31:35,000 --> 02:31:37,000
Like, all of the grinding and all of the, you know, whatever.

1802
02:31:37,000 --> 02:31:41,000
I'm just like, they don't click the same way for me they used to.

1803
02:31:41,000 --> 02:31:45,000
I see. That's fair. But that's Pokemon Red and Blue.

1804
02:31:45,000 --> 02:31:50,000
God, especially for people of a certain age, you know, the age you're at, JD.

1805
02:31:50,000 --> 02:31:53,000
That was like the first game for a lot of 20-somethings.

1806
02:31:53,000 --> 02:31:55,000
Yeah, it wasn't at all.

1807
02:31:55,000 --> 02:31:57,000
Yeah, so that's a darn good point there.

1808
02:31:57,000 --> 02:32:01,000
What about you, RageNator, real quick? What was the first RPG for you?

1809
02:32:01,000 --> 02:32:07,000
You know, the funny thing is, I had the original Final Fantasy and Dragon Warrior for NES.

1810
02:32:07,000 --> 02:32:15,000
I think anyone that subscribed to Nintendo Power for a certain length of time got Dragon Warrior for free.

1811
02:32:15,000 --> 02:32:20,000
But, even with that being said, I never really cared for RPGs back then.

1812
02:32:20,000 --> 02:32:22,000
I thought they were a total snore.

1813
02:32:22,000 --> 02:32:30,000
But, in effect, my father mainly bought Final Fantasy for himself more than anything.

1814
02:32:30,000 --> 02:32:34,000
But, I didn't even play any RPGs on the Super Nintendo.

1815
02:32:34,000 --> 02:32:43,000
But, once I got myself a PlayStation 1, early on, I got myself three RPGs.

1816
02:32:43,000 --> 02:32:53,000
Wild Arms, trying to think of, it's made by Konami.

1817
02:32:53,000 --> 02:32:54,000
Suikoden.

1818
02:32:54,000 --> 02:33:00,000
No, not Suikoden. Something Heart, Valiant Heart, Vagrant Heart, something like that.

1819
02:33:00,000 --> 02:33:01,000
Vagrant Story?

1820
02:33:01,000 --> 02:33:07,000
No, I think Vagrant Story.

1821
02:33:07,000 --> 02:33:09,000
Vandal Hearts, says Ronda.

1822
02:33:09,000 --> 02:33:12,000
Square Enix. What I'm thinking of is by Konami.

1823
02:33:12,000 --> 02:33:13,000
Vandal Hearts?

1824
02:33:13,000 --> 02:33:14,000
Oh yeah, Vandal Hearts.

1825
02:33:14,000 --> 02:33:15,000
There it is.

1826
02:33:15,000 --> 02:33:18,000
And then, of course, obviously Final Fantasy VII.

1827
02:33:18,000 --> 02:33:28,000
But, those three, kind of made me say, wow, I've been such an idiot.

1828
02:33:28,000 --> 02:33:32,000
These games are actually fun.

1829
02:33:32,000 --> 02:33:34,000
I should have been playing RPGs all along, you know?

1830
02:33:34,000 --> 02:33:36,000
It's like me and Mass Effect.

1831
02:33:36,000 --> 02:33:41,000
I didn't care for it the first time, then I went back years later and I was like, wow, I was a real idiot the first time.

1832
02:33:41,000 --> 02:33:49,000
You know, Dark Tetsuya said something about Shadow Run, but that made me think of another, like, I would kind of consider this an RPG of a real different type on the NES.

1833
02:33:49,000 --> 02:33:54,000
It made me think of Shadow Gate, which was another game that really made me love.

1834
02:33:54,000 --> 02:33:58,000
It's a very different type of RPG. It's not like the whole RPG with hit points and everything.

1835
02:33:58,000 --> 02:34:04,000
Some would more consider that a point-and-click game, but I think there's a certain RPG element to it that I really love.

1836
02:34:04,000 --> 02:34:07,000
Anyway, Rage Nator, great question. I'm going to let you go, though, so we can get more calls.

1837
02:34:07,000 --> 02:34:09,000
Sure, have a nice night.

1838
02:34:09,000 --> 02:34:10,000
Take care, my friend.

1839
02:34:10,000 --> 02:34:13,000
OrangeLoungeRadio, all one word on Skype if you want to give us a call.

1840
02:34:13,000 --> 02:34:20,000
If you want to talk about RPGs or you want to talk about something else, you want to talk about the Nintendo Switch or maybe something else we have not addressed yet tonight, we can do that.

1841
02:34:20,000 --> 02:34:25,000
Let me check in with Loki to see if there's any last-minute stories we want to talk about while we wait for a call at OrangeLoungeRadio on Skype.

1842
02:34:25,000 --> 02:34:27,000
Sadly, no.

1843
02:34:27,000 --> 02:34:28,000
No?

1844
02:34:28,000 --> 02:34:29,000
No.

1845
02:34:29,000 --> 02:34:30,000
Oh.

1846
02:34:30,000 --> 02:34:32,000
I mean, it's a slow news week and there's no news tonight.

1847
02:34:32,000 --> 02:34:38,000
Yeah, it was a little slower of a news week this week, so let's see, let me go to some chat comments here.

1848
02:34:39,000 --> 02:34:42,000
DungeonBuster has a good point here about RPGs in 2017. DungeonBuster says,

1849
02:34:42,000 --> 02:34:46,000
The first few months of 2017 have been nuts with RPGs.

1850
02:34:46,000 --> 02:34:56,000
Tales of Berseria, Yakuza 0, Horizon Zero Dawn, Nier Automata, Torment, Tides Into Minera, and coming up are Andromeda and Persona 5.

1851
02:34:56,000 --> 02:35:02,000
Yeah, isn't this weird where, like, I think a lot of people are forgetting, well, probably not a lot.

1852
02:35:02,000 --> 02:35:06,000
I keep forgetting that Persona 5 is coming out sooner rather than later.

1853
02:35:07,000 --> 02:35:09,000
Because, yeah, Persona 5 is like the first week of April, right?

1854
02:35:09,000 --> 02:35:13,000
Was it supposed to be Valentine's Day weekend and then they, like, bumped it back a little further?

1855
02:35:13,000 --> 02:35:14,000
I don't remember.

1856
02:35:14,000 --> 02:35:18,000
I thought it was for some reason. Maybe I'm confusing it with something else.

1857
02:35:18,000 --> 02:35:22,000
But, yeah, Persona 5 is going to be just a few weeks away.

1858
02:35:22,000 --> 02:35:24,000
I think it's only, like, a week or two after Mass Effect Andromeda.

1859
02:35:24,000 --> 02:35:28,000
So, they, okay, Act Def confirms, yes it was, so I'm not crazy.

1860
02:35:28,000 --> 02:35:30,000
It was bumped back just a little bit there.

1861
02:35:30,000 --> 02:35:35,000
But, you know, Persona is a huge, that is, like, the RPG series for a lot of people.

1862
02:35:35,000 --> 02:35:40,000
So, you know, that's going to be a big, Mass Effect's a big series, Persona's a big series.

1863
02:35:40,000 --> 02:35:43,000
Whew! Anyway, we got another call coming in. Let's get to it.

1864
02:35:43,000 --> 02:35:45,000
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?

1865
02:35:45,000 --> 02:35:47,000
Hey, hey, hey, it's Aranma.

1866
02:35:47,000 --> 02:35:49,000
Hey, Aranma, how you doing?

1867
02:35:49,000 --> 02:35:52,000
I'm pretty good besides my usual trip to IKEA.

1868
02:35:52,000 --> 02:35:56,000
Slowly still getting past that whole flooding I mentioned before.

1869
02:35:56,000 --> 02:36:01,000
I'm now putting in new and improved bookcases to organize all my hobbies.

1870
02:36:02,000 --> 02:36:07,000
So, Rama, I know you called in with something else, but I have to derail for a minute because you're going to want to know about this.

1871
02:36:07,000 --> 02:36:14,000
I got confirmation. I will be in your area the weekend of October 13th when you're not going to be there.

1872
02:36:14,000 --> 02:36:16,000
God damn it!

1873
02:36:16,000 --> 02:36:26,000
However, Alan and I are currently trying to plan, like, do we want to go, because the ceremony is on Friday the 13th, as I suspected.

1874
02:36:26,000 --> 02:36:29,000
She's that type of gal who wanted her wedding on Friday the 13th.

1875
02:36:29,000 --> 02:36:35,000
So, we may come in, like, Tuesday, because the wedding is actually in Connecticut.

1876
02:36:35,000 --> 02:36:39,000
But Alan's never been to New York and has kind of wanted to see it.

1877
02:36:39,000 --> 02:36:45,000
So, I'm kind of like, maybe we need to fly in a few days early so we can be the big stupid tourists that go see something on Broadway and go out.

1878
02:36:45,000 --> 02:36:47,000
You know, it just depends how much time off work we can get.

1879
02:36:47,000 --> 02:36:52,000
So, I don't know when you leave for your other engagement, but either we're going to come in a few days early or we're going to stay a few days extra.

1880
02:36:52,000 --> 02:36:56,000
And I just have to figure out all those details, but it's still a few months away.

1881
02:36:56,000 --> 02:37:01,000
So, guess what, Northeast, I'm going to be back in October.

1882
02:37:01,000 --> 02:37:07,000
That's going to work, and it's kind of interesting you say that, because I was hanging out with one of my close friends last night.

1883
02:37:07,000 --> 02:37:10,000
She was actually going to get married on Friday the 13th.

1884
02:37:10,000 --> 02:37:18,000
It must be a trend. Maybe Alan and I will renew our vows while we're there. No, I would never try to upstage my friend.

1885
02:37:18,000 --> 02:37:22,000
So, because I'd get beat up.

1886
02:37:23,000 --> 02:37:26,000
Anyway, what did you want to call in to talk about before I derailed us?

1887
02:37:26,000 --> 02:37:31,000
Alright, couple things. Number one, at the top of the show, you made a mention to the movie Big.

1888
02:37:31,000 --> 02:37:32,000
Yes.

1889
02:37:32,000 --> 02:37:36,000
I don't know if you know, but F.A.O. Schwartz is no longer there.

1890
02:37:36,000 --> 02:37:40,000
That's right. It turned into Toys R Us for a bit, right? And now that's gone too, right?

1891
02:37:40,000 --> 02:37:49,000
No, no, no. The location, F.A.O. Schwartz was like much further up. It was pretty much next door to the Apple Store, the 24-hour Apple Store.

1892
02:37:49,000 --> 02:37:50,000
Oh.

1893
02:37:50,000 --> 02:37:55,000
Yeah. Due to rent, that closed. The big Toys R Us due to rent, that closed.

1894
02:37:55,000 --> 02:37:59,000
Oh, so they were not the same building. I got that wrong. Okay.

1895
02:37:59,000 --> 02:38:05,000
And also, you mentioned earlier about snow conventions and PAX East.

1896
02:38:05,000 --> 02:38:08,000
Brother, let me tell you a quick story.

1897
02:38:08,000 --> 02:38:09,000
Can't wait.

1898
02:38:09,000 --> 02:38:14,000
This is my first Catsacon. And I'm so hot hot hot to go, whatever.

1899
02:38:14,000 --> 02:38:22,000
And, you know, we do our thing. Saturday night, halfway through masquerading all of that, it starts snowing.

1900
02:38:22,000 --> 02:38:31,000
And I'm talking blizzard-conditioned snow. And there's signs around the convention telling people how much snow is expected and what to do.

1901
02:38:31,000 --> 02:38:34,000
Some people say fuck it, pack they shit, and leave that night.

1902
02:38:34,000 --> 02:38:40,000
They were the smart ones. The rest of us are like, you know, it's probably not going to be that bad.

1903
02:38:40,000 --> 02:38:46,000
They'll be shoveled in the morning. We can leave sometime Sunday. Famous last words.

1904
02:38:46,000 --> 02:38:57,000
Wake up that morning, we find out that Jersey has shut down, Virginia has shut down, and New York was getting close to being shut down as well.

1905
02:38:57,000 --> 02:39:04,000
Oh, no. Oh, no. You were trapped in a five-star hotel with copious amounts of liquor and anime geeks.

1906
02:39:04,000 --> 02:39:06,000
Give me a break. That was the best convention ever.

1907
02:39:06,000 --> 02:39:10,000
Hold up. All that liquor was gone Saturday night. I'm talking about Sunday.

1908
02:39:10,000 --> 02:39:18,000
All that liquor was gone on Saturday. Fair retort, sir. You win.

1909
02:39:18,000 --> 02:39:26,000
First thing we do is grab our stuff and we go to the CVS, and lo and behold, you know it's an anime con because all the ramen is gone.

1910
02:39:27,000 --> 02:39:33,000
So we're like, what the hell are we going to eat? We grab chips and cookies and soda and we're like, we will live off of that.

1911
02:39:33,000 --> 02:39:38,000
One of the people in our party, yes, it was like a Final Fantasy party, the four of us.

1912
02:39:38,000 --> 02:39:44,000
One suggested, well, why don't we go to McDonald's? We look across the street at McDonald's, even in the snow.

1913
02:39:44,000 --> 02:39:48,000
There are people standing outside for food. I said, no, that's okay.

1914
02:39:48,000 --> 02:39:54,000
Wow. So when did it end up happening? Did you end up having to stay longer or what happened?

1915
02:39:54,000 --> 02:40:05,000
Yes. The hotel extended the rates. They let everyone stay Sunday for free because of what was going on, and then they extended the rate for Monday.

1916
02:40:05,000 --> 02:40:10,000
So people were rebooking and rerooming to save a few dollars.

1917
02:40:10,000 --> 02:40:22,000
And what was also great was the hotel said, if we were to raise $500, they would give us two of the big rooms downstairs and make it into one so we could extend the convention.

1918
02:40:22,000 --> 02:40:28,000
So we kind of figured out where all the con goers were. We were knocking on their doors, sort of like Girl Scouts.

1919
02:40:28,000 --> 02:40:38,000
In this case, we're anime scouts, whatever, cosplay scouts, telling people, you know, we're trying to raise money so we can extend the con by one day and get food.

1920
02:40:38,000 --> 02:40:49,000
We end up raising about a grand and we end up getting like food platters from a supermarket up the way because it was enough snow plowed out, you know, we can get some stuff delivered.

1921
02:40:49,000 --> 02:41:03,000
So from like 3pm until like 1, 2 o'clock in the morning, we're downstairs in the basement of the, I believe it's the Hyatt, Regent, Hyatt Plaza, Regency, whatever hotel, which was really awesome.

1922
02:41:03,000 --> 02:41:14,000
We have one section that was DDR, one section was AMVs, one section was D&D buffer stores fighting this, this and that, and just platters of food. So we end up making the best of it.

1923
02:41:14,000 --> 02:41:22,000
That's awesome. That's a great convention story, even though, you know, it sucks about the weather, just that whole community and you killed me with anime scouts.

1924
02:41:22,000 --> 02:41:25,000
What's sad, though, is it's not the first time I've heard that story.

1925
02:41:25,000 --> 02:41:34,000
When I went to Katsucon, you kept telling me about that epic year because I think it would only been like two or three years before the year I went.

1926
02:41:34,000 --> 02:41:48,000
Yeah, and see, and what was happening was, now from that point on, whenever there is weather about snow when it comes to Katsucon, if it's before, which has happened, people will go down instead of Thursday, they'll go down Wednesday night to beat the storm.

1927
02:41:48,000 --> 02:41:54,000
Or if they hear a talk of snow on Sunday, people will leave and be like, uh-uh, not happening.

1928
02:41:55,000 --> 02:42:09,000
That's, that's so awesome. I love that story. That's great. So any conventions that should be on our radar coming up, Rama? You're the king of conventions here on the network with your buddies, of course, at Anime Jam Session.

1929
02:42:10,000 --> 02:42:24,000
Zenkai Con, that's the big convention my whole squad, we are so hyped for. It's like the really awesome down-home convention. It's a mix of anime, video games, fantasy, sci-fi, it's a little bit of everything.

1930
02:42:24,000 --> 02:42:38,000
One of the guests of honor is Steve Blum, as we all know, as from Cowboy Bebop. Why is his name, I'm missing his name right now, he voices on Cowboy Bebop, but we all know Steve Blum.

1931
02:42:38,000 --> 02:42:40,000
That is awesome.

1932
02:42:40,000 --> 02:42:49,000
Yeah, and he's also the main guy behind the whole voice actor strike. He's the one that kind of got it going, kind of spearheaded it.

1933
02:42:49,000 --> 02:42:52,000
Is that still going with the video games?

1934
02:42:52,000 --> 02:42:58,000
I have no idea. It probably is, but I haven't heard anything from my VA friends, so...

1935
02:42:58,000 --> 02:43:13,000
Will you do me a favor? Will you poke some of your VA friends and see if that strike's still going? And if it is, I want to talk to some voice actors about it, because I think a lot of gamers, you know, we kind of forgot about it during the holiday and through this console hysteria, but if there's still no resolution, that's not good.

1936
02:43:13,000 --> 02:43:17,000
I got you. I will do what I can. I got you on that, you know?

1937
02:43:17,000 --> 02:43:23,000
I appreciate it. All right. Well, my friend, I'm gonna let you go, so we wrap up the show, but thanks for the call.

1938
02:43:23,000 --> 02:43:27,000
Hey, you know, by the way, we say Mario, not Mario, it's Mario.

1939
02:43:27,000 --> 02:43:29,000
Mario's fine.

1940
02:43:29,000 --> 02:43:37,000
Yeah, I've never heard it pronounced any other way. It's like anime and anime and people look at you and they're like, who taught you that?

1941
02:43:37,000 --> 02:43:44,000
I've heard Super Mario, but I didn't necessarily pin that as a New York thing, just a wrong thing.

1942
02:43:44,000 --> 02:43:45,000
There you go.

1943
02:43:45,000 --> 02:43:46,000
All right. Take care, my friend.

1944
02:43:46,000 --> 02:43:48,000
You too. Stay awesome, dude.

1945
02:43:48,000 --> 02:43:49,000
You too. Bye.

1946
02:43:49,000 --> 02:43:50,000
Bye.

1947
02:43:50,000 --> 02:43:55,000
All right. We're gonna close up Skype for now, but if you didn't get through and you want to, you can always tweet at us, at OLR.

1948
02:43:55,000 --> 02:44:00,000
You can always email us, of course. Participate at Orangelaunchradio.com, but that is gonna do it for tonight's episode.

1949
02:44:00,000 --> 02:44:05,000
We already said good night to Dark Sakura, but we'll say good night now to our guests, JD, as well as Loki.

1950
02:44:05,000 --> 02:44:09,000
Let me first, of course, pimp a good, good cheer.

1951
02:44:09,000 --> 02:44:12,000
If you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Launch Radio, please tell a friend or two about the show.

1952
02:44:12,000 --> 02:44:18,000
Help us spread the word. A nice five-star review on iTunes goes an awful long way as well to help spread the word,

1953
02:44:18,000 --> 02:44:22,000
because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but we can only spread those voices if they're here.

1954
02:44:22,000 --> 02:44:24,000
So, yeah, help us spread the word.

1955
02:44:24,000 --> 02:44:29,000
Five-star reviews on iTunes go a long, long, long way, or wherever it is that you heard about this podcast.

1956
02:44:29,000 --> 02:44:32,000
JD, thanks so much for being here and sitting in the studio. Hope you had a good time tonight.

1957
02:44:32,000 --> 02:44:33,000
Yeah, it's always fun.

1958
02:44:33,000 --> 02:44:37,000
Enjoy playing more Switch. I hope to see you back here.

1959
02:44:37,000 --> 02:44:39,000
You said you were debating coming up for Indie Arcade, huh?

1960
02:44:39,000 --> 02:44:40,000
Yeah.

1961
02:44:40,000 --> 02:44:44,000
That'd be cool. So, sadly, Mario Kart won't be out then yet, but we'll hopefully have some more Switch games to play.

1962
02:44:44,000 --> 02:44:45,000
Right.

1963
02:44:45,000 --> 02:44:47,000
Exactly. Any final thoughts for listeners tonight?

1964
02:44:47,000 --> 02:44:49,000
Um, not really.

1965
02:44:49,000 --> 02:44:53,000
Not really. All right. Just, you know, take care of each other, I guess. Don't be mean.

1966
02:44:53,000 --> 02:44:59,000
All right. Thank you, JD. Loki, here we are at the end of our 679th episode.

1967
02:44:59,000 --> 02:45:02,000
Good luck. I hope you're able to get Zelda this week. Hope Pay Day's good to you.

1968
02:45:02,000 --> 02:45:03,000
Okay.

1969
02:45:03,000 --> 02:45:05,000
All right. Any final thoughts for listeners tonight?

1970
02:45:05,000 --> 02:45:12,000
No. It's funny. I'm working. I've been doing game programming all week. Sadly, it's probably not something you'll ever see.

1971
02:45:12,000 --> 02:45:14,000
Well, no.

1972
02:45:14,000 --> 02:45:16,000
It's not always the case, Loki?

1973
02:45:16,000 --> 02:45:20,000
No, no, no. It's a work-related project, so that's why it's...

1974
02:45:20,000 --> 02:45:23,000
All right. So, when you get paid to do it, then you actually do it.

1975
02:45:23,000 --> 02:45:27,000
No, it's more for a presentation, but my presentation looks fucking awesome.

1976
02:45:27,000 --> 02:45:31,000
All right. All right. That's going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

1977
02:45:31,000 --> 02:45:36,000
Thank you guys so much for listening. My final thought tonight? Pizza. Mmm. Delicious.

1978
02:45:36,000 --> 02:45:40,000
Have a good week, everybody. We'll see you back here in seven days to do it all over again.

1979
02:45:40,000 --> 02:45:47,000
Thanks for your support. It means the world. In the meantime, enjoy your Switch or your PlayStation 4 or whatever it is you happen to be playing.

1980
02:45:47,000 --> 02:45:49,000
Good night, everybody.
