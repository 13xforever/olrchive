WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:17.640
It's here, it's here, the latest release of worldly travel with technology along the

00:17.640 --> 00:18.640
way.

00:18.640 --> 00:21.800
That's right, Horizon Zero Dawn is finally out to scratch all your mechanical overload

00:21.800 --> 00:22.800
survival dr...

00:22.800 --> 00:23.800
No.

00:23.800 --> 00:24.800
What?

00:24.800 --> 00:25.800
The Switch.

00:25.800 --> 00:26.800
What, like a light switch?

00:26.800 --> 00:27.800
No, the Nintendo Switch.

00:27.800 --> 00:33.320
What's a Nintendo Switch?

00:33.320 --> 00:36.160
This week, the Nintendo Switch was released.

00:36.160 --> 00:43.840
Stay tuned for more!

00:43.840 --> 00:46.880
Jason just totally pulled in, I don't even know her there in the intro.

00:46.880 --> 00:49.360
Hi everybody, my friends out there on the internet.

00:49.360 --> 00:53.920
Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice, it is Orange Lounge

00:53.920 --> 00:59.440
Radio, live tonight, March the 5th of 2017, episode number 678 of our show.

00:59.440 --> 01:04.680
My name is Rob Roberts, joining me in studio, as always, say hello to DarkSakura, or Jamie

01:04.680 --> 01:05.680
Summers.

01:05.680 --> 01:06.680
Words.

01:06.680 --> 01:07.680
Hello.

01:07.680 --> 01:08.680
Greetings.

01:08.680 --> 01:11.120
Sorry to hear you're still sick, but you sound a lot better, you look a lot better.

01:11.120 --> 01:14.520
I feel better, well I've also got a lot of makeup on.

01:14.520 --> 01:18.600
I feel a lot better than I did.

01:18.600 --> 01:21.440
But you have this weird thing with your taste buds, like you were telling me earlier that

01:21.440 --> 01:23.000
chocolate tastes like soap.

01:23.000 --> 01:27.960
Yeah, actually everything tastes vaguely soap-like.

01:27.960 --> 01:34.200
I don't know if it's the Zithromax, but it started happening before I was on azithromycin.

01:34.200 --> 01:40.000
I've been on two different antibiotics, but I feel a lot better than I have in a while.

01:40.000 --> 01:43.960
Well good, feeling better is good, that's where we want you to be.

01:43.960 --> 01:49.920
I feel like Frank, even smiling makes my face ache.

01:49.920 --> 01:54.360
It's funny because when you were talking about that you don't taste things the same, my first

01:54.360 --> 01:58.920
thought y'all was, I want her to lick a Nintendo Switch cartridge live on air.

01:58.920 --> 02:01.600
And I was going to bypass that whole thing because I'm like, okay, that joke is like

02:01.600 --> 02:07.360
played out, like everybody who wanted clicks watched me lick a thing.

02:07.360 --> 02:12.920
And to think, that girl that licked the PSP was a fame whore at that time.

02:12.920 --> 02:15.680
But now y'all licking Nintendo Switch cartridges like the candy.

02:15.680 --> 02:18.440
This would be science.

02:18.960 --> 02:21.280
And then you'd have my DNA on your games.

02:21.280 --> 02:28.280
Yes, and now I'm like Dark Sakura, now we have a reason why for science, exactly, that

02:28.280 --> 02:31.920
maybe she does need to lick a Nintendo Switch cartridge because I want to know if under

02:31.920 --> 02:36.360
the right chemical thing, maybe it tastes like soap as well.

02:36.360 --> 02:38.440
Well if you want, it's your stuff.

02:38.440 --> 02:42.240
Alright, I'm going to think about it while we introduce Tech Master Loki.

02:42.240 --> 02:45.080
The other thing is what it would taste like with those little miracle berries.

02:45.080 --> 02:47.920
Alright, Tech Master Loki, how are you?

02:48.400 --> 02:49.400
I'm fine.

02:49.400 --> 02:50.400
Yeah, good?

02:50.400 --> 02:51.400
Yeah.

02:51.400 --> 02:55.360
You sound a little exhausted when you say that, I'm fine, like it's been a real long

02:55.360 --> 02:56.360
week or something.

02:56.360 --> 03:00.560
It's exhausting eating those 11 breadsticks.

03:00.560 --> 03:02.440
The Dark Sakura ate one, she's like...

03:02.440 --> 03:07.200
I was wondering, you know, for science, you know, since she's tried chocolate and it tastes

03:07.200 --> 03:10.440
like soap, maybe soap tastes like chocolate.

03:10.440 --> 03:13.240
I'm not going to lick soap.

03:13.240 --> 03:14.240
That's unhealthy.

03:14.320 --> 03:15.320
Dark Sakura.

03:15.320 --> 03:19.360
I love the coffee, it's like I'm getting a hint of what the flavor would have tasted

03:19.360 --> 03:20.360
like.

03:20.360 --> 03:21.360
And then soap.

03:21.360 --> 03:25.600
Like freaking ivory bar soap, seriously.

03:25.600 --> 03:30.160
Now I'm sure Dark Sakura, you might be wondering like, why is Dark Sakura eating soap?

03:30.160 --> 03:31.160
To know this.

03:31.160 --> 03:37.640
But I'm sure as a child, she had soap in her mouth a lot and got to know the taste very

03:37.640 --> 03:38.640
well.

03:38.640 --> 03:43.480
Well, a good way to know how something tastes is to smell it.

03:43.800 --> 03:47.760
Because your olfactory scents, which I have none right now, and your sense of taste are

03:47.760 --> 03:48.760
tied.

03:48.760 --> 03:55.480
And when one of those is depressed or whatever, then the other is going to be affected.

03:55.480 --> 03:58.200
And that's the exact thing with the Nintendo Switch cartridge for me.

03:58.200 --> 04:03.640
Like I don't need to lick it because you can smell that new case smell that isn't exactly

04:03.640 --> 04:04.640
pleasant.

04:04.640 --> 04:05.640
It's not a new car smell.

04:05.640 --> 04:06.640
A new car smells nice.

04:06.640 --> 04:11.280
A new cartridge, when you open that, you know, Zelda case for the first time, it's kind of...

04:11.280 --> 04:12.880
I don't even know if I'd go that far.

04:12.880 --> 04:17.200
Like it just smells like, like a chemical that I don't want to eat.

04:17.200 --> 04:18.200
That's what it smells like.

04:18.200 --> 04:19.200
A chemical.

04:19.200 --> 04:24.760
Well, it's just, well, and everything vaguely smells either like soap or blood.

04:24.760 --> 04:26.240
There's no in between.

04:26.240 --> 04:30.040
This is the stupidest sick I've ever had, next to walking pneumonia.

04:30.040 --> 04:33.320
Or is Dark Sakura just cleaning her victims before she kills them?

04:33.320 --> 04:37.200
So if they put that stuff on the cartridge because they don't want to eat, do they put

04:37.200 --> 04:38.200
it on the controllers?

04:38.200 --> 04:39.800
Because I don't think they put it on the controllers.

04:39.800 --> 04:41.440
I don't think they did put it on the controllers.

04:41.440 --> 04:43.240
Have your kids put it in their mouth yet?

04:43.240 --> 04:45.560
I don't, I'm sure I don't have, you know, kids.

04:45.560 --> 04:49.000
I'm sure a kid is, what are you talking about?

04:49.000 --> 04:51.960
You should do have kids.

04:51.960 --> 04:52.960
Ask Nellie.

04:52.960 --> 04:53.960
Hold on a minute.

04:53.960 --> 04:55.840
Did Loki just come out here and be like, I don't have kids.

04:55.840 --> 04:59.480
Like why, why, why are you a pathological liar on tonight's OLR, Loki?

04:59.480 --> 05:01.840
Yes, you do have kids.

05:01.840 --> 05:07.640
It's just my, my path to presidency, right?

05:07.640 --> 05:09.000
I don't have kids, Rob.

05:09.000 --> 05:10.000
You have kids.

05:10.000 --> 05:13.160
I don't think you're the one that has the kids, these are my kids.

05:13.160 --> 05:14.520
They're yours now.

05:14.520 --> 05:17.520
Bringing them over, bye.

05:17.520 --> 05:18.720
Touched them less.

05:18.720 --> 05:20.520
You're the one that's been wiretapping my house.

05:20.520 --> 05:21.520
All right.

05:21.520 --> 05:22.520
Anyway.

05:22.520 --> 05:23.520
Anyway.

05:23.520 --> 05:27.880
No, I don't have a Switch, so obviously I can't eat anything that's in the Switch box.

05:27.880 --> 05:28.880
Right.

05:28.880 --> 05:31.160
So you have, you don't have, you have kids, but you don't have a Switch.

05:31.160 --> 05:32.160
That's, that's the difference.

05:32.160 --> 05:34.440
Yeah, I have kids and no Switch.

05:34.440 --> 05:38.960
And I'm not planning on buying a Switch and I also didn't buy Zelda because I don't have

05:38.960 --> 05:41.080
$60 right now to spend on Zelda.

05:41.080 --> 05:45.080
So I will just wait a couple of weeks and play it then.

05:45.080 --> 05:46.360
Money, serious business.

05:46.360 --> 05:50.400
Well, I could, I could buy it now, but then there may be a chance that I won't be able

05:50.400 --> 05:51.920
to afford food later in the week.

05:51.920 --> 05:52.920
That would be unfortunate.

05:52.920 --> 05:53.920
Yeah.

05:53.920 --> 05:57.200
I would just rather not do that because I don't need to.

05:57.200 --> 05:59.480
I'm already playing Skyrim, so I don't need that.

05:59.480 --> 06:00.480
All right.

06:00.480 --> 06:02.960
We'll talk a little more about the Switch here in a moment because it's that thing everybody's

06:02.960 --> 06:03.960
talking about.

06:03.960 --> 06:06.880
But I want to get to our chat room, of course, and acknowledge you guys live in our chat

06:06.880 --> 06:10.720
room because we do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock

06:10.720 --> 06:13.560
Eastern at vognetwork.com.

06:13.560 --> 06:18.600
That's V-O-G network.com right after the Bobby Black Wolf show, who talked also a lot tonight

06:18.600 --> 06:19.960
about the Nintendo Switch.

06:19.960 --> 06:23.880
Now, obviously there's a, there was a lot that happened in games this week.

06:23.880 --> 06:25.020
It could be easy to sit here.

06:25.020 --> 06:27.320
We could probably talk for three hours about the Nintendo Switch.

06:27.320 --> 06:29.880
However, there's a ton of other stuff that happened in gaming.

06:29.880 --> 06:32.160
Game developers conference happened this week.

06:32.160 --> 06:33.160
Hello.

06:33.160 --> 06:34.160
But it was interesting.

06:34.220 --> 06:38.240
We didn't really get a lot of news out of game developers conference, did we?

06:38.240 --> 06:44.120
We got like weird little like tidbits and insight, like w w like that eight bit Zelda

06:44.120 --> 06:48.260
picture that came up where everybody was like, Oh my God, it's Zelda maker.

06:48.260 --> 06:53.320
But no, like a Nintendo would not announce a Zelda maker at a GDC type event.

06:53.320 --> 06:58.460
B what it ended up really being was that, you know, Breath of the Wild was basically

06:58.460 --> 07:04.020
created in that eight bit environment to build some of the, you know, ideas that they

07:04.020 --> 07:08.580
had going into that game were kind of executed in the eight bit format before they, they

07:08.580 --> 07:15.300
did the big fancy world that they have now making a long story prototyping the, the concepts.

07:15.300 --> 07:16.300
Yeah.

07:16.300 --> 07:18.660
There's a lot of talk about like what goes into game development.

07:18.660 --> 07:19.660
That's really it.

07:19.660 --> 07:23.780
I mean, there's other little things here and there, like the first 10 minutes of the, um,

07:23.780 --> 07:25.300
gone home successor, was it Tacoma?

07:25.300 --> 07:28.140
So what it's called like, I think like the first 10 minutes of that were shown, it's

07:28.140 --> 07:31.660
just like some little tidbits here and there, but not a very news filled game developers

07:31.660 --> 07:36.900
conference, nothing like on the scale of like PlayStation move or anything, which again,

07:36.900 --> 07:41.420
game developers conferences, not E3, it is, it is for those types of, but I would totally

07:41.420 --> 07:47.460
go for more, you know, a better PlayStation move if you will.

07:47.460 --> 07:51.500
Well, isn't that kind of what they're trying to do with the VR and those controllers and

07:51.500 --> 07:52.500
everything?

07:52.500 --> 07:53.500
Right.

07:53.500 --> 07:55.040
But I mean, like the PlayStation is not doing that.

07:55.040 --> 07:56.740
They're like, yeah, we have these move controllers.

07:56.740 --> 07:57.740
Those will work.

07:58.340 --> 08:03.100
Uh, some comments in chat over at live.vognetwork.com, uh, because of course, again, we tape live

08:03.100 --> 08:04.100
on Sunday nights.

08:04.100 --> 08:07.400
I want to get to some of our chatters, uh, SSU100Matt talking about the taste test for

08:07.400 --> 08:11.580
Dark Sakura says, the real question we need to know, what does pinkberry taste like?

08:11.580 --> 08:14.180
I think someone should go get her some to test this.

08:14.180 --> 08:16.020
I agree with this, but I will tell you this.

08:16.020 --> 08:20.020
I have orange sherbet at home and it tastes kind of off too.

08:20.020 --> 08:21.420
Does it taste like soap?

08:21.420 --> 08:26.060
Not quite like soap, but like orange medicine.

08:26.060 --> 08:27.100
Oh.

08:27.460 --> 08:28.460
Like Dayquil or something.

08:28.460 --> 08:29.460
Kinda.

08:29.460 --> 08:30.460
Yeah.

08:30.460 --> 08:34.340
It's like the edge between, this tastes really good to, this tastes like fucking Dayquil.

08:34.340 --> 08:35.340
Mm hmm.

08:35.340 --> 08:36.340
So, or like Theraflu.

08:36.340 --> 08:41.540
Uh, Darktosea in chat says, I just thought that thing was neat, interesting way to prototype

08:41.540 --> 08:42.540
for Breath of the Wild.

08:42.540 --> 08:45.620
Uh, yeah, I thought it was a neat, uh, discussion too.

08:45.620 --> 08:50.060
Um, and that's, you know, again, what GDC is really for is about like here, here's how

08:50.060 --> 08:51.620
the sausage is made type of thing.

08:51.620 --> 08:55.500
Here's the thought process that went into what we made and yeah, Black Wolf kind of

08:55.500 --> 08:59.020
echoing there in chat, GDC shouldn't be for news anyway.

08:59.020 --> 09:04.820
Um, yeah, I can agree with that to a point, but you also in the past, they have dropped

09:04.820 --> 09:08.460
a few bombshells here and there, but that's usually Sony that's done that, right?

09:08.460 --> 09:12.660
They did the move one year and they did, they announced something else one year.

09:12.660 --> 09:15.460
Was it the VR or was it something else they announced GDC?

09:15.460 --> 09:17.540
I want to say it was another one of those things that kind of came a win.

09:17.540 --> 09:22.180
I don't think it was the VR, but anyway, like, you know, sometimes with those tech development,

09:22.180 --> 09:25.580
you might get a little, little few drops here and there because while you have all these

09:25.580 --> 09:30.300
game developers there, they want these developers to think about, Ooh, how could I develop for

09:30.300 --> 09:31.300
that?

09:31.300 --> 09:32.300
Right.

09:32.300 --> 09:34.580
That's why you announced the PlayStation move early like that is, Ooh, how can I develop

09:34.580 --> 09:35.580
for this?

09:35.580 --> 09:39.520
But you know, you're not going to get like, Oh my God, Half Life 3, like that's not going

09:39.520 --> 09:41.340
to fucking happen at a game developers conference.

09:41.340 --> 09:46.400
So, you know, it, it is for talks and, um, a lot of networking that goes on at the, those

09:46.400 --> 09:47.400
events for sure.

09:47.400 --> 09:52.000
Uh, wheeling and dealing of those sorts, but, um, otherwise, yeah, it's, it's, it is for

09:52.000 --> 09:53.000
the developers.

09:53.000 --> 09:54.880
Uh, thank you, Bobby Black Wolf.

09:54.880 --> 09:55.880
That's it.

09:55.880 --> 09:57.280
PlayStation home was announced to GDC.

09:57.280 --> 09:58.280
That's right.

09:58.280 --> 09:59.280
That was the other thing I was thinking of.

09:59.280 --> 10:00.280
Thank you.

10:00.280 --> 10:01.280
Uh, let's see.

10:01.280 --> 10:07.240
Also in chat, um, over at live.vognetwork.com actdeft is wondering, did dark soccer confuse

10:07.240 --> 10:09.480
dove soap with dove chocolate?

10:09.480 --> 10:11.480
That's a, that's a great question.

10:11.480 --> 10:14.920
Very, you know, your products at a supermarket, very well done.

10:15.880 --> 10:16.880
Let's see.

10:16.880 --> 10:21.880
Uh, Stoppy talking about the, uh, eight bit Zelda thing says, uh, I call that BS.

10:21.880 --> 10:25.440
It's like saying checkers was a prototype for tactical RPGs.

10:25.440 --> 10:26.440
I don't know.

10:26.440 --> 10:27.440
I kind of thought it was neat.

10:27.440 --> 10:31.080
There's a lot of, there, there is a lot of stuff from Zelda one that I see in the new

10:31.080 --> 10:33.960
Zelda, but we'll, we'll get to that in a little bit.

10:33.960 --> 10:36.360
Being that I was doing prototyping all this week.

10:36.360 --> 10:37.360
Yeah.

10:37.360 --> 10:40.880
Um, no, that is how you do prototyping because you don't want to spend a ton of time and

10:40.880 --> 10:46.040
money on an elaborate prototype when you're just prototyping certain concepts like the

10:46.040 --> 10:51.160
fire spreading thing and trying to solve, you know, puzzles in multiple ways.

10:51.160 --> 10:52.560
You don't need anything elaborate.

10:52.560 --> 10:55.360
You just want to try it so that you can get feedback right away.

10:55.360 --> 10:56.360
I'm kind of surprised.

10:56.360 --> 10:59.840
I mean, again, I don't know all the insides of your, your project you're doing and I know

10:59.840 --> 11:04.260
I'm not supposed to, but I'm kind of surprised you guys didn't go to GDC for a day or anything

11:04.260 --> 11:05.260
like that.

11:05.260 --> 11:06.260
I was kind of surprised.

11:06.260 --> 11:09.360
So, yeah, we don't think we need to not in the budget.

11:09.360 --> 11:13.800
Well, not in the budget and not really needed at this point yet.

11:13.800 --> 11:14.800
Fair enough.

11:14.800 --> 11:15.800
Fair enough.

11:15.800 --> 11:16.800
All right.

11:16.800 --> 11:18.120
Um, so let's talk about here for our kickoff topic tonight.

11:18.120 --> 11:19.320
Let's talk about the Nintendo switch.

11:19.320 --> 11:21.920
What do y'all think over in chat over at live.fognetwork.com?

11:21.920 --> 11:25.120
Those of you that picked one up, do you, do you think it was worth the money?

11:25.120 --> 11:27.560
Uh, do you, are you happy with your purchase?

11:27.560 --> 11:29.560
Where, where's your head out with the Nintendo switch?

11:29.560 --> 11:32.600
Um, I'll talk about my thoughts in a little bit.

11:32.600 --> 11:37.160
Um, I want to get to dark soccer though, because you spent, even though you and Dan did not

11:37.160 --> 11:43.140
buy a switch, but you did buy Zelda Breath of the Wild on Wii U and you played a buddy's

11:43.140 --> 11:46.240
switch for a good 30 minutes or something like that.

11:46.240 --> 11:47.240
Yeah.

11:47.240 --> 11:48.640
Um, he brought his switch to work.

11:48.640 --> 11:51.120
So while he was working, I was on lunch.

11:51.120 --> 11:52.120
I played for a little bit.

11:52.120 --> 11:54.800
So you didn't walk away that impressed with it, huh?

11:54.800 --> 11:55.800
Not really.

11:55.800 --> 11:58.520
It's nothing that I would want to go out and spend money on right away or would have waited

11:58.520 --> 12:01.560
for the reservation or anything like that.

12:01.560 --> 12:11.400
So for, for me, the, there was two, I don't know, the controller when using just the controller

12:11.400 --> 12:16.400
felt too lightweight, too almost flimsy to me.

12:16.400 --> 12:20.560
I mean, the buttons were nice, they were responsive, but it didn't feel substantial.

12:20.560 --> 12:25.340
It had the same comfort of the Saturn analog controller, which as I'm sure everyone knows

12:25.340 --> 12:31.860
is my favorite home controller, but, um, it didn't have the same sturdiness and heft

12:31.860 --> 12:32.860
to it.

12:32.860 --> 12:35.860
Are we talking about the controllers attached to the screen or are we talking about that

12:35.860 --> 12:38.060
little puppy dog shell, the controller shell?

12:38.060 --> 12:39.060
Okay.

12:39.060 --> 12:40.060
Okay.

12:40.060 --> 12:41.060
Just the control.

12:41.060 --> 12:42.060
Cause we had the little screen out independently.

12:42.060 --> 12:43.060
Right.

12:43.060 --> 12:46.580
And graphically I didn't see too much of a difference except it was a little bit harder

12:46.580 --> 12:51.340
to see cause that smaller screen, it's still actually was cause even on the Wii U there's

12:51.340 --> 12:56.060
a, uh, uh, areas where you'll get draw distance issues and the same thing was happening on

12:56.060 --> 12:57.460
that little screen.

12:57.460 --> 13:02.820
And then, um, the other thing is that it was kind of hard to see, like the motion was a

13:02.820 --> 13:05.580
little bit harder to detect on that smaller screen.

13:05.580 --> 13:10.980
And then, um, with it connected with the, the joy con connected on either side and at

13:10.980 --> 13:13.560
that point then felt too bulky.

13:13.560 --> 13:16.860
So it just like there wasn't a happy medium with it.

13:16.860 --> 13:19.060
Um, I haven't tried it on a TV yet.

13:19.060 --> 13:24.840
I would, I'm curious, but, um, I would actually be more curious to see it on my TV so that

13:24.840 --> 13:26.980
I can actually switch channels.

13:26.980 --> 13:32.900
Um, this is something that Dan and I did with, um, Symphony of the Night where we had the

13:32.900 --> 13:38.820
PlayStation one and the Saturn one and we're switching between, uh, channels to see what,

13:38.820 --> 13:41.020
you know, do a graphical comparison.

13:41.020 --> 13:46.560
I'd really like to get to the same place in both games and then switch channels to see

13:46.560 --> 13:52.640
what it looks like to compare because I think doing it on two different TVs wouldn't be

13:52.640 --> 13:56.900
a really good test because different TVs display different ways, but I'd like to see it like

13:56.900 --> 13:59.180
on my TV both ways.

13:59.180 --> 14:04.840
So even though your perception of Zelda in particular was a little more negative, these

14:04.840 --> 14:08.980
first impressions of the Switch, you're still kind of like, I'm still open to get one when

14:08.980 --> 14:11.120
the games start coming out a little later on, right?

14:11.120 --> 14:12.120
That's, that's kind of the sense I got from you.

14:12.120 --> 14:16.400
There is no reason for me to have one right now, because I mean, there's no Animal Crossing

14:17.240 --> 14:24.640
Um, the other game that I wanted, Puyo Puyo Tetris, I already own, I have it on PS4.

14:24.640 --> 14:29.200
And so there's, there's legitimately no reason for me to have one.

14:29.200 --> 14:33.880
But when we start talking about the Splatoon twos and the Mario Odyssey's and whatever

14:33.880 --> 14:34.880
other surprises.

14:34.880 --> 14:35.880
I haven't played the first Splatoon.

14:35.880 --> 14:36.880
Oh, you're missing out.

14:36.880 --> 14:37.880
So I'm not excited.

14:37.880 --> 14:38.880
It's fun.

14:38.880 --> 14:39.880
You're missing out.

14:39.880 --> 14:40.880
I'm sure it is, but I'm not excited.

14:40.880 --> 14:45.840
I mean, I have no basis of comparison and Mario, I mean, I'll be honest, I'm not as

14:46.280 --> 14:52.160
excited over Mario games these days, you know, I want there to be something that is going

14:52.160 --> 14:55.880
to, uh, I think be more exciting.

14:55.880 --> 15:00.320
I want something unique, something different, you know, I mean, the only thing out right

15:00.320 --> 15:05.440
now that I would want to play is Binding of Isaac two and even then, you know, and that's

15:05.440 --> 15:06.440
not actually out yet.

15:06.440 --> 15:07.440
Yeah.

15:07.440 --> 15:08.440
It's not on the story yet.

15:08.440 --> 15:12.440
At least not in the U S they had the, um, the advanced orders.

15:12.440 --> 15:15.240
I think it's like soon it's within the next couple of weeks.

15:15.240 --> 15:18.760
I think they're really trying to use the Indies to kind of pace out some of the releases

15:18.760 --> 15:21.360
a little bit like blaster master is next week.

15:21.360 --> 15:22.360
Yeah.

15:22.360 --> 15:26.040
So, and that's, I'm really excited about that is happier about that, but I'm still not,

15:26.040 --> 15:28.160
I'm still not sold.

15:28.160 --> 15:32.280
And I mean, I went into two different game stops today, um, because I was looking for

15:32.280 --> 15:37.700
Wii U pro controller, which they didn't have, I got it at target, although I did get a Jessica

15:37.700 --> 15:42.080
Jones pop figure cause it's the only place I've seen it, but you know, and I was just

15:42.080 --> 15:45.600
talking to the staff, you know, just, you know, shooting the shit.

15:45.600 --> 15:49.960
And they're like, yeah, they all went out really quickly, but you know, we haven't had,

15:49.960 --> 15:53.520
you know, other than that, there hasn't been too many people in asking about them.

15:53.520 --> 15:59.160
So it was kind of like that initial rush, but you haven't had a lot of like either just

15:59.160 --> 16:02.680
people kind of know they're gone or yeah, they just like, yeah, we're going to get some

16:02.680 --> 16:08.140
more, but right now the only ones that we have in stock are, um, our, uh, orders.

16:08.140 --> 16:12.420
And they said that, um, even then no one's come to pick some of those up.

16:12.420 --> 16:18.040
Um, going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com, uh, come on, Noel, Gus and chat says it's

16:18.040 --> 16:19.040
been underwhelming.

16:19.040 --> 16:23.540
I love breath of the wild, but other than that, it feels like a generic Android tablet.

16:23.540 --> 16:26.960
If I could play Overwatch on it, I probably wouldn't complain, but yeah, it sucks.

16:26.960 --> 16:29.020
There aren't other games to play.

16:29.020 --> 16:32.760
And then, uh, let's see, act deft in chat over at live.vognetwork.com said I would give

16:32.760 --> 16:35.700
my opinion on the switch, but we all know what happened.

16:36.260 --> 16:38.660
Amazon apparently fucked a lot of people over.

16:38.660 --> 16:45.940
Um, and I feel kind of bad because I got, I ordered from Amazon and I got it.

16:45.940 --> 16:50.700
Uh, I was a little worried though for a minute, which is the whole reason why I had the two

16:50.700 --> 16:52.780
systems pre-ordered in the very beginning.

16:52.780 --> 16:57.060
I also had one from Best Buy, but I was able to find a home for the Best Buy one and I

16:57.060 --> 17:00.220
don't, I don't scalp, I charged exactly what I paid for it.

17:00.220 --> 17:04.760
So it worked out all in the end or what have you, but yeah, Amazon really screwed a lot

17:04.760 --> 17:05.760
of people over.

17:05.760 --> 17:10.320
Uh, and apparently they were like charging cards when they didn't really have the inventory

17:10.320 --> 17:14.460
or they were, they weren't charging, they were putting the hold on them and Amazon had

17:14.460 --> 17:15.680
no reason to do that.

17:15.680 --> 17:20.040
So I was, because they didn't have the stock for it, they didn't make good on the delivery.

17:20.040 --> 17:24.840
And I think Amazon has a big part of its, its case that it tries to do with Amazon Prime

17:24.840 --> 17:26.780
is that you get the release day delivery.

17:26.780 --> 17:31.040
So a lot of the crap they've been pulling from what I'm hearing, again, my experience

17:31.040 --> 17:36.600
ended up being fine, but I know several people, not just Act Deaf, but I know quite a few

17:36.600 --> 17:39.440
other people that were having problems with Amazon.

17:39.440 --> 17:43.880
So I think that was kind of bullshit on Amazon's part and I'm kind of glad they're getting

17:43.880 --> 17:47.080
dragged through the media for it and I sort of think it's unacceptable they didn't have

17:47.080 --> 17:48.080
an answer yet.

17:48.080 --> 17:54.280
Um, so I, I hope that Amazon comes out on Monday to talk a little more about how they're

17:54.280 --> 17:58.480
going to prevent that kind of crap in the future because that was, uh, that was, um,

17:58.480 --> 18:02.920
really just, it makes a lot of people question if they want to order stuff from Amazon in

18:02.920 --> 18:03.920
the future.

18:03.920 --> 18:08.800
Uh, when it comes to like release day delivery and all that stuff, I mean, ordering a Blu-ray

18:08.800 --> 18:12.160
that you don't need right away or something is one thing, but you know, when you want

18:12.160 --> 18:15.720
something on the day it releases because that's where all the hype is at or whatever, like

18:15.720 --> 18:16.960
that's what you expect.

18:16.960 --> 18:18.800
So, um, yeah.

18:18.800 --> 18:22.120
The worst part to me is the fact that Amazon put a hold on the cards.

18:22.120 --> 18:25.040
Uh, that's, that's the part that I can't reconcile in my mind.

18:25.040 --> 18:30.160
Like it would be one crime for them to, well, not, not actual crime, but it'd be customer

18:30.160 --> 18:31.160
service crime.

18:31.160 --> 18:34.760
It'd be one thing for them to not deliver on the promise they made, but it's a whole,

18:34.760 --> 18:39.320
like it's even worse that they put the holds on the cards and still didn't deliver on it.

18:39.320 --> 18:43.640
That is really fucked up and, uh, Amazon needs to answer for that.

18:43.640 --> 18:48.480
I, I, I told one of my friends to file a complaint with a better business bureau, but my friend

18:48.480 --> 18:51.840
was like, oh, that never does anything and that I'm like, well, it doesn't do anything

18:51.840 --> 18:54.840
because everybody's, everybody, well, everybody's

18:54.840 --> 18:58.040
he sits there and says, I'm, it's not going to do anything.

18:58.040 --> 19:00.920
If everybody who sat there and says, it's not going to do anything, did something, then

19:00.920 --> 19:05.640
it would force Amazon to at least answer the question about what's going on.

19:05.640 --> 19:11.300
And I, they may have put, I think I did, they, they put some, you know, very general type

19:11.300 --> 19:16.680
of thing out there, but it is really messed up that Amazon had, they were saying, come

19:16.680 --> 19:18.080
to our bookstores.

19:18.080 --> 19:23.040
We've got the Amazon's or the Nintendo switch here at our Amazon bookstores come to this

19:23.040 --> 19:27.580
and, and was advertising all these other ways, but yet they could not fulfill the obligations

19:27.580 --> 19:32.840
that they had in the other side to, to me that says, is Amazon too big of a company?

19:32.840 --> 19:34.380
Does it need to be broken up?

19:34.380 --> 19:38.080
Cause it doesn't know what the other ends of the company are doing, but I will go there,

19:38.080 --> 19:46.320
but I'm just, no, you know what they should do instead sell more games through other platforms.

19:46.320 --> 19:47.320
I see what you did there.

19:47.320 --> 19:48.320
Yeah.

19:48.320 --> 19:49.320
We'll get to that a little later.

19:49.320 --> 19:50.320
Okay.

19:50.320 --> 19:51.320
Um, okay.

19:51.320 --> 19:55.040
Let me talk about me and the Nintendo switch though, because, um, I'm, I'm walking away

19:55.040 --> 19:56.960
from it feeling more positive.

19:56.960 --> 20:01.100
I think a lot of the complaints that have been put out here on this show, especially

20:01.100 --> 20:06.320
in regards to, um, the amount of software that's out right now and all that stuff.

20:06.320 --> 20:12.200
Uh, the fact that the OS is, is pretty much half baked, that there's a lot to come soon.

20:12.200 --> 20:14.160
That all still kind of holds true.

20:14.160 --> 20:18.040
But I will say this, I walked away from it feeling different than dark Sakura.

20:18.040 --> 20:21.360
I thought the controllers in the shell, I really liked the way that felt.

20:21.360 --> 20:26.720
Um, and especially when I was playing a game like fast racing remix, when the HD vibrations

20:26.720 --> 20:29.960
came into play, which you can even feel in the shell, like I thought that was a really

20:29.960 --> 20:31.720
good feel for the game.

20:31.720 --> 20:34.980
Um, so I actually liked the controller.

20:34.980 --> 20:38.760
It is a little bulky when you have the controllers on the side and you're playing it as a tablet.

20:38.760 --> 20:41.620
That was not my favorite way to play.

20:41.620 --> 20:43.200
And I don't think I'll be doing that a lot.

20:43.200 --> 20:46.800
Like I, I, you know, tried it a couple of times this weekend.

20:46.800 --> 20:51.000
Like I would lay in bed and play Zelda or something like that, which it is kind of a

20:51.000 --> 20:53.960
small screen for a game like Zelda.

20:53.960 --> 20:55.140
There's a lot going on.

20:55.140 --> 20:58.360
I think that small screen probably works, works a lot better with something like probably

20:58.360 --> 21:02.740
the one, two switch game or like fast racing Neo or something where there's not as much

21:02.740 --> 21:07.400
like writing or small details in the distance things you're looking for, uh, that probably

21:07.400 --> 21:08.400
work a little better.

21:08.400 --> 21:12.860
Um, on a television, they do that, that, that, uh, tablet.

21:12.860 --> 21:20.340
But to the tablet's credit, I was like, wow, this is a very bright, vibrant, detailed screen.

21:20.340 --> 21:24.140
And I, I thought it was a neat little piece of technology.

21:24.140 --> 21:27.380
And I think the whole thing feels really sleek to me.

21:27.380 --> 21:32.220
Like it feels like something Apple would have put out, honestly, like the, the switch feels

21:32.220 --> 21:33.980
really nice in that regard.

21:33.980 --> 21:39.340
And one thing I do like about the OS is that everything really snaps.

21:39.340 --> 21:44.020
Everything is very fast and I've gotten to come to accept with Nintendo systems that

21:44.020 --> 21:45.920
they're very slow and clunky.

21:45.920 --> 21:50.540
Like the Wii, it's like now loading the everybody votes channel, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,

21:50.540 --> 21:51.540
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

21:51.540 --> 21:53.900
Like in that whole thing or the eShop, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, like it's

21:53.900 --> 21:58.100
like one loading screen turns into another loading screen turns into like, it's really,

21:58.100 --> 21:59.220
really slow.

21:59.220 --> 22:02.920
But on the switch, everything is pretty fast.

22:02.920 --> 22:08.380
Like going in, going into your picture gallery to edit the picture and share the picture

22:08.420 --> 22:10.300
is like navigating a website.

22:10.300 --> 22:15.860
It's really fast and not like a clunky mess.

22:15.860 --> 22:20.420
Like it kind of is on the 3DS trying to share things to Miiverse.

22:20.420 --> 22:24.940
I am a little surprised though that Nintendo did not take the opportunity to, when you

22:24.940 --> 22:28.920
have this friends list and you have these things that you're sharing, I'm really surprised

22:28.920 --> 22:33.820
that it didn't create a newsfeed type of thing like you have on PlayStation 4.

22:33.820 --> 22:35.300
Maybe that's something that will come in the future.

22:35.300 --> 22:41.260
I don't know, but the OS on the Switch, as we all know, is very bare bones right now.

22:41.260 --> 22:43.600
There is really not a lot there.

22:43.600 --> 22:47.860
One of the other big things that came out this week, the whole fact that friend codes

22:47.860 --> 22:52.380
are back and they're on the Nintendo Switch, which we thought Nintendo was fucking done

22:52.380 --> 22:55.620
with, but it looked like they weren't.

22:55.620 --> 22:59.680
However, this is a big however, it does function very differently.

22:59.680 --> 23:05.640
It's not quite as bad as it was on the Wii because, picture this, instead of a gamer

23:05.640 --> 23:08.540
tag right now, you have a barcode number.

23:08.540 --> 23:09.960
That's basically how it works.

23:09.960 --> 23:13.080
So if somebody knows your barcode number, they can still send you a friend request.

23:13.080 --> 23:16.120
You don't have to do that whole thing where it's like, I'm going to add you, then you're

23:16.120 --> 23:19.080
going to add me, and then if we both added each other, we'll be friends.

23:19.080 --> 23:20.760
You don't have to wait for that whole process.

23:20.760 --> 23:23.720
You still send a friend request like you do on the other consoles.

23:23.720 --> 23:28.160
The other thing is that strangely, even though on the Switch you can't search Twitter and

23:28.160 --> 23:32.120
Facebook for your friends, even though the system connects to Twitter and Facebook for

23:32.120 --> 23:38.160
the sharing of the pictures, you can see who you've added on Miitomo and who you've added

23:38.160 --> 23:41.280
on Super Mario Run.

23:41.280 --> 23:46.360
I still have not played the Fire Emblem game, but I imagine that's there too.

23:46.360 --> 23:49.520
Those games will connect to your Twitter and your Facebook.

23:49.520 --> 23:53.520
So since I added most of my Facebook Nintendo peeps through those games, they're all showing

23:53.520 --> 23:54.520
up on my list.

23:54.520 --> 24:01.240
My only grievance is that the list that's showing up is like everybody's first name

24:01.240 --> 24:05.320
because it's not showing their tags or their Nintendo Network names or whatever.

24:05.320 --> 24:09.680
It's showing whatever they use to sign into their console at home, which most people use

24:09.680 --> 24:11.000
their first name.

24:11.000 --> 24:17.280
Now I use Rob Roberts just because that's just become synonymous with my identity online

24:17.280 --> 24:18.280
and everything.

24:18.280 --> 24:20.560
So I know when I'm sending friend requests to people, they see Rob Roberts, and it's

24:20.560 --> 24:22.760
pretty easy to know who I am.

24:22.760 --> 24:24.300
Bobby was talking about this on his show.

24:24.300 --> 24:25.420
His name is Black Wolf.

24:25.420 --> 24:27.180
So I know who that was.

24:27.180 --> 24:32.260
But then I'll get a friend request from Chris and I'm like, who the hell is Chris?

24:32.260 --> 24:34.760
And I'm like, this me doesn't look very familiar to me.

24:34.760 --> 24:39.940
I know like five different Chris's and maybe this is somebody on Twitter where like, if

24:39.940 --> 24:43.620
it was their Twitter handle, I'd know who it is instantly or if it's their Twitter picture.

24:43.620 --> 24:44.620
Yeah.

24:44.620 --> 24:45.620
New Switch, who dis?

24:45.620 --> 24:49.680
That's exactly the game that I've been playing all week.

24:49.680 --> 24:50.940
But here's the other thing.

24:50.940 --> 24:54.660
And the reason why I haven't been giving out my friend code or really seeking out to expand

24:54.660 --> 24:59.580
my friends list right now, why, why do I need friends on the Switch?

24:59.580 --> 25:05.700
There's literally nothing it does, except I can see when they're online and what they're

25:05.700 --> 25:06.700
playing.

25:06.700 --> 25:08.000
Can't send them messages.

25:08.000 --> 25:11.740
I don't have any games that I can, I have Zelda and I have fast remix and I probably

25:11.740 --> 25:15.100
will end up buying Shovel Knight before the week is up and I'll probably get Blaster Master

25:15.100 --> 25:16.100
next week.

25:16.100 --> 25:18.820
That's a pretty, that's a nice little set of games there for the first two weeks of

25:18.820 --> 25:24.980
a console, but none of them connect to online and use my friends list yet.

25:24.980 --> 25:29.700
Fast Rebracing is supposed to do that in its first update, but otherwise what's the point

25:29.700 --> 25:30.700
of a friends list right now?

25:30.700 --> 25:31.700
There really isn't one.

25:31.700 --> 25:35.980
It's just kind of like you're building it out because you hope that later on when Splatoon

25:35.980 --> 25:40.980
2 comes out, which is really going to need that online thing to be done, then you have

25:40.980 --> 25:44.780
your friends list built up so that you have lots of people to splatter with point paint

25:44.780 --> 25:46.980
a little later on.

25:46.980 --> 25:55.100
So even though there's some weird shit with the friend codes and these other things that

25:55.100 --> 26:00.900
are definitely like half baked and under finished in the OS, what it does do, it does very well

26:00.900 --> 26:02.460
and it does it fast.

26:02.460 --> 26:07.780
And it does have me excited for like, wow, when this gets to the holiday and Nintendo

26:07.780 --> 26:12.700
really sees out its roadmap and you know there's a roadmap because you go to one thing and

26:12.700 --> 26:16.460
it'll be like, this feature will be enabled when we go online in June.

26:16.460 --> 26:20.460
This feature will be enabled when such and such launches in October.

26:20.460 --> 26:24.020
This feature will be enabled when we figure out how to do networking.

26:24.020 --> 26:29.540
It's like you see everything's got a month with it, but I am excited to see what it's

26:29.540 --> 26:34.100
going to look like towards the end of the year because I think at the end of the year,

26:34.100 --> 26:38.020
this is going to function a lot more like we kind of thought it was going to in the

26:38.020 --> 26:42.060
beginning and maybe some of these shortcomings will be fixed.

26:42.060 --> 26:46.860
Which brings me to the other thing I want to do here at the top of the show, which was

26:46.860 --> 26:48.300
something we talked about last week.

26:48.300 --> 26:52.740
So last week I said, what we need to do is we need to, since we know the Switch is going

26:52.740 --> 26:57.160
to change a lot before December, we need to have the world's smallest time capsule or

26:57.160 --> 26:58.740
shortest time capsule.

26:58.740 --> 27:03.660
So we're going to actually build one here in studio that we will open at the end of

27:03.660 --> 27:06.420
the year for either the Christmas show or the New Year's show.

27:06.420 --> 27:08.780
So here's the deal.

27:08.780 --> 27:11.540
Stoppy in chat says, Sky, did you remember to bring the sock?

27:11.540 --> 27:12.660
No, good news.

27:12.660 --> 27:13.940
We don't have to do the sock tonight.

27:13.940 --> 27:16.660
Well, maybe I'll put a sock in there, but here's the thing.

27:16.660 --> 27:20.300
Dark Sakura found a target in the discount aisle or something.

27:20.300 --> 27:23.460
She's got this little like Darth Vader looking thing.

27:23.460 --> 27:25.500
Is this like a kid's bank or something?

27:25.500 --> 27:29.700
Yeah, it's like a little coin bank, but it has the shape I wanted.

27:29.700 --> 27:31.020
It has the shape.

27:31.020 --> 27:32.020
It's perfect.

27:32.020 --> 27:35.980
It actually looks like something that you could like shove up an elephant's butt.

27:35.980 --> 27:37.640
That's what it looks like to me.

27:37.680 --> 27:39.160
It's an elephant suppository.

27:39.160 --> 27:40.160
Exactly.

27:40.160 --> 27:42.560
But that's, I guess that's what a time capsule should be, right?

27:42.560 --> 27:47.120
So we're going to, we're going to put some things now in the time capsule.

27:47.120 --> 27:48.360
What are we going to put in here?

27:48.360 --> 27:55.680
We want to put, what are our grievances with Nintendo Switch that we hope they fix by holiday?

27:55.680 --> 27:58.920
What do we hope the Switch looks like by holiday?

27:58.920 --> 28:01.840
That's what we're going to put here inside the time capsule.

28:01.840 --> 28:06.080
So I'm going to get some pieces of paper here and I brought two pieces of paper.

28:06.080 --> 28:08.800
Sorry, I guess we'll have to share a little bit, but Loki, here you go.

28:08.800 --> 28:12.640
I'll give you a piece of paper, save one for me because I want to start writing.

28:12.640 --> 28:14.320
I did not prepare well for this.

28:14.320 --> 28:19.160
Oh, if you guys in chat over at live.vognetwork.com have some ideas.

28:19.160 --> 28:20.160
No, I think that's-

28:20.160 --> 28:21.160
I don't get to contribute.

28:21.160 --> 28:22.160
No, you get to contribute.

28:22.160 --> 28:23.160
We just have to share a little bit.

28:23.160 --> 28:24.160
Geez.

28:24.160 --> 28:25.160
But you have to tell-

28:25.160 --> 28:26.160
I don't want to share.

28:26.160 --> 28:27.160
On my own.

28:27.160 --> 28:28.160
Tough.

28:28.160 --> 28:29.160
I'm going to wash, I'm going to wash your mouth out with soap.

28:29.160 --> 28:31.320
I'm going to wash your mouth out with chocolate.

28:31.320 --> 28:32.760
All right.

28:32.760 --> 28:36.040
Anyway, I'm going to get a pen over here.

28:36.040 --> 28:37.800
We need to start talking about the grievances.

28:37.800 --> 28:40.540
Loki, I know you have some grievances.

28:40.540 --> 28:42.960
What are you going to put in the time capsule, Loki?

28:42.960 --> 28:44.960
I don't know.

28:44.960 --> 28:48.040
I haven't actually played the system yet.

28:48.040 --> 28:52.520
I mean, I have lots of grievances, mainly stop releasing unfinished consoles, goddammit.

28:52.520 --> 28:53.520
But that's not-

28:53.520 --> 28:54.520
Okay.

28:54.520 --> 28:55.520
Hold on.

28:55.520 --> 28:56.520
Hold on.

28:56.520 --> 28:57.520
That's not a grievance.

28:57.520 --> 28:58.520
Yeah, I know that they can fix.

28:58.520 --> 28:59.520
Yeah.

28:59.520 --> 29:03.140
Well, it is one they could fix, but that's not going to be fixed for several years.

29:03.140 --> 29:05.860
That's not something they can do by the end of the year.

29:05.860 --> 29:06.860
That's the problem.

29:06.860 --> 29:09.820
Is it supposed to be like what I think the grievances are going to be by then?

29:09.820 --> 29:10.820
So like if I say-

29:10.820 --> 29:11.820
No.

29:11.820 --> 29:12.820
Here, let me give you an example.

29:12.820 --> 29:15.740
Here's the first thing I'm going to put in the time capsule.

29:15.740 --> 29:19.000
Did they bundle?

29:19.000 --> 29:20.000
Did they bundle?

29:20.000 --> 29:21.000
I'm actually writing.

29:21.000 --> 29:22.000
That's what I'm talking about.

29:22.000 --> 29:27.840
Did they bundle one, two, switch in yet?

29:27.840 --> 29:29.100
That's the first thing I'm going to put in.

29:29.100 --> 29:30.620
Did they bundle one, two, switch in yet?

29:30.620 --> 29:32.100
I'm going to put a statement.

29:32.100 --> 29:33.100
Aw, fucking hell.

29:33.100 --> 29:36.700
They delayed the new Super Mario Brothers game again.

29:36.700 --> 29:39.580
There, you could put that in there.

29:39.580 --> 29:40.580
You write that.

29:40.580 --> 29:44.420
I bet they delayed Mario Brothers there.

29:44.420 --> 29:46.060
And we're going to sign these too.

29:46.060 --> 29:48.220
You have to be responsible for the crap you put in there.

29:48.220 --> 29:49.220
All right.

29:49.220 --> 29:50.220
So there's my first.

29:50.220 --> 29:51.820
Did they bundle one, two, switch in yet?

29:51.820 --> 29:52.820
Signed Rob.

29:52.820 --> 29:54.380
So Loki's putting in.

29:54.380 --> 29:56.500
Did they delay the Mario game?

29:56.500 --> 29:58.180
All right.

29:58.180 --> 30:00.620
Dark Soccer, I see you writing over there.

30:00.620 --> 30:01.620
What are you writing?

30:02.140 --> 30:03.140
Virtual Console.

30:03.140 --> 30:04.420
Oh, yeah.

30:04.420 --> 30:06.580
Where's my damn Virtual Console?

30:06.580 --> 30:08.020
I had another one too.

30:08.020 --> 30:09.420
And what's that you're going to write?

30:09.420 --> 30:16.820
The DS Store or like some of the old games like they had on the DS Store.

30:16.820 --> 30:19.540
So like, did they add DS to Virtual Console?

30:19.540 --> 30:22.500
Well, they did do that on the Wii U though.

30:22.500 --> 30:25.420
I don't know how they would do that with the switch because there's just the one screen.

30:25.420 --> 30:26.620
I don't know if they would do that.

30:26.620 --> 30:28.020
I guess they might.

30:28.820 --> 30:33.220
You could do something where maybe you tilt the tablet vertically and it could be two

30:33.220 --> 30:34.220
screens.

30:34.220 --> 30:35.220
Just scrap that.

30:35.220 --> 30:36.220
Okay.

30:36.220 --> 30:37.220
I would go with augmented reality.

30:37.220 --> 30:38.220
Oh.

30:38.220 --> 30:41.860
It doesn't have a camera on it, but if it had, it doesn't have a camera on it, does

30:41.860 --> 30:42.860
it?

30:42.860 --> 30:43.860
No, it doesn't have a camera on it.

30:43.860 --> 30:44.860
What about virtual reality?

30:44.860 --> 30:46.980
Some people suspect they could go that direction with it.

30:46.980 --> 30:49.420
No, I want augmented reality.

30:49.420 --> 30:54.980
Like for example, if it had like a camera attachment, you could then, you know, like

30:54.980 --> 30:57.820
things like Ingress or, you know.

30:57.820 --> 30:58.820
Pokemon Go.

30:58.820 --> 30:59.820
Or Pokemon Go.

30:59.820 --> 31:00.820
Exactly.

31:00.820 --> 31:01.820
Okay.

31:01.820 --> 31:02.820
Okay.

31:02.820 --> 31:03.820
Now I see where you're going with this.

31:03.820 --> 31:08.500
Because you can, we do know Nintendo is going, you might think like, well, that's not going

31:08.500 --> 31:12.020
to work, Jamie, because the tablet has nothing in it besides wifi.

31:12.020 --> 31:17.020
However, we know the tablet is going to connect to your phone through an app because that's

31:17.020 --> 31:18.540
how the voice chat's going to work.

31:18.540 --> 31:25.020
So theoretically, what's stopping that tablet from being like a Pokemon Go Plus or something?

31:25.020 --> 31:28.300
Doesn't it work in the same way where it's using the information from your phone to get

31:28.300 --> 31:29.300
the data it needs?

31:29.300 --> 31:33.980
Or even so, like the way that, you know, I have a first gen Apple watch and it doesn't

31:33.980 --> 31:38.820
have the built in GPS, but it'll still, I can go walk around the block, come back and

31:38.820 --> 31:44.040
sync my data and it would pull my GPS based off my phone, my phone location.

31:44.040 --> 31:48.140
So the same thing in theory could work on the Wii U, I mean not the Wii U, but the Switch.

31:48.140 --> 31:49.140
Yeah, I know.

31:49.140 --> 31:52.100
I see the people in chat saying there's, you need a GPS attachment for that.

31:52.100 --> 31:53.240
There's no GPS.

31:53.240 --> 31:55.440
If it does Bluetooth though, it'll connect to the phone.

31:55.440 --> 31:59.000
It could, I think it is a stretch, but why not?

31:59.000 --> 32:00.000
Yeah.

32:00.000 --> 32:01.000
Just a tad.

32:01.000 --> 32:05.120
It's, it's like, Hey, I've got this phone that could totally run, you know, Pokemon

32:05.120 --> 32:09.840
Go with the GPS and the data, but instead I'm going to tether to this large cumbersome

32:09.840 --> 32:10.840
thing.

32:10.840 --> 32:15.360
I'm not saying specifically Pokemon Go, I'm saying you can have a more advanced augmented

32:15.360 --> 32:16.360
reality.

32:16.360 --> 32:21.880
But the money was in Pokemon Go, so why wouldn't there be something else AR that Nintendo is

32:21.880 --> 32:22.880
going to try?

32:22.920 --> 32:27.400
I'm going to be this year myself, but, but that would be something I think would be definitely

32:27.400 --> 32:28.880
something that would get more people to buy it.

32:28.880 --> 32:29.880
All right.

32:29.880 --> 32:30.880
Well write it down.

32:30.880 --> 32:31.880
What the fuck?

32:31.880 --> 32:32.880
All right.

32:32.880 --> 32:33.880
Good.

32:33.880 --> 32:34.880
All right.

32:34.880 --> 32:35.880
Uh, let's see.

32:35.880 --> 32:36.880
Um, go into it.

32:36.880 --> 32:37.880
I'm looking into chat over at live.fognetwork.com.

32:37.880 --> 32:39.280
JD has a good one.

32:39.280 --> 32:40.800
Better me import.

32:40.800 --> 32:45.380
It's dumb that it can't pull from the Nintendo account or me Tomo.

32:45.380 --> 32:46.380
That's a good point.

32:46.380 --> 32:47.380
We're going to write that.

32:47.380 --> 32:49.880
We're going to write that one down and we'll credit that to JP.

32:49.880 --> 32:51.680
Oh, do you write that one down for JD?

32:51.680 --> 32:52.680
Okay.

32:52.680 --> 32:53.680
I was trying that one for JD.

32:53.680 --> 32:55.180
I was thinking of it too.

32:55.180 --> 32:56.180
So I totally agree with that.

32:56.180 --> 32:57.180
So you stole it.

32:57.180 --> 32:58.180
All right.

32:58.180 --> 32:59.180
No, no, no, no.

32:59.180 --> 33:01.680
I credited it to him, but I was thinking I would like me verse.

33:01.680 --> 33:02.680
Fair enough.

33:02.680 --> 33:03.680
Fair enough.

33:03.680 --> 33:04.680
Uh, Oh, okay.

33:04.680 --> 33:05.680
Here's a good one from dungeon buster.

33:05.680 --> 33:06.680
I'm going to write this one down.

33:06.680 --> 33:07.680
Okay.

33:07.680 --> 33:12.120
Dungeon buster said, has Nintendo lowered the bullshit pricing for their pro controller

33:12.120 --> 33:13.120
yet?

33:13.120 --> 33:14.120
And I liked, yes.

33:14.120 --> 33:15.120
What do you mean?

33:15.120 --> 33:17.480
The Wii U pro controller went down.

33:17.480 --> 33:20.680
I'd imagine that the switch pro controller, not in a year, not in the first year.

33:20.680 --> 33:21.680
It's not going to happen.

33:21.680 --> 33:23.720
Not in the first year, but I'll write it down.

33:23.720 --> 33:24.720
I'll just write down.

33:24.720 --> 33:26.480
Did any of the accessories go down in price yet?

33:26.480 --> 33:30.480
Cause they're all that fucking was it the doc or whatever.

33:30.480 --> 33:36.040
I saw the tear down video that is not $90 with a tech as just fucking plastic and like

33:36.040 --> 33:38.960
some pastors and that's it.

33:38.960 --> 33:39.960
Some bullshit.

33:39.960 --> 33:42.040
That's what that is.

33:42.040 --> 33:43.040
Okay.

33:43.040 --> 33:44.040
Dungeon buster.

33:44.040 --> 33:48.080
You know, this whole writing thing doesn't make for very good radio.

33:48.080 --> 33:49.520
Well, I can read mine then.

33:49.520 --> 33:50.520
All right.

33:50.520 --> 33:51.520
All right.

33:52.360 --> 33:53.360
And this is only obvious.

33:53.360 --> 33:59.280
I bet the system's hacked already.

33:59.280 --> 34:00.960
Two months to Linux.

34:00.960 --> 34:03.200
I don't even give it that.

34:03.200 --> 34:04.200
Yeah.

34:04.200 --> 34:08.160
It's, they're already trying to find exploits and it's only going to piss people off more

34:08.160 --> 34:13.520
that they block out, you know, features that most of their consumers like, you know, like

34:13.520 --> 34:16.320
being able to back up their data and stuff like that.

34:16.320 --> 34:18.720
And you know, being able to transfer saves.

34:18.720 --> 34:21.000
But of course we're so afraid that they're going to get hacked.

34:21.000 --> 34:22.000
Oh my goodness.

34:22.000 --> 34:23.000
We're so afraid.

34:23.000 --> 34:24.000
It's going to get hacked anyway.

34:24.000 --> 34:26.400
So you know what?

34:26.400 --> 34:27.400
There's nothing you can do.

34:27.400 --> 34:29.000
There's nothing you can do.

34:29.000 --> 34:32.000
It's just going to happen.

34:32.000 --> 34:40.280
Well, there's a whole thing about the, the, the save States and all that.

34:40.280 --> 34:44.760
I know, I know you're mentioning, but um, they go online or they'll, they'll work around

34:44.760 --> 34:45.760
it.

34:45.760 --> 34:46.760
Hacker's going to hack, right?

34:46.760 --> 34:47.760
Right.

34:47.760 --> 34:48.760
They're already trying to exploit it through the web browser.

34:48.760 --> 34:51.560
That doesn't exist, but does exist.

34:51.560 --> 34:56.360
People have actually exploited that to create a web browser for it already.

34:56.360 --> 35:01.520
Um, let's see what else to, uh, what else do I want to put in the time capsule?

35:01.520 --> 35:04.760
Um, I think the virtual console one was good.

35:04.760 --> 35:07.560
That was the one I was thinking of as well, but you already got that in there.

35:07.560 --> 35:14.980
Um, Oh, maybe with the virtual console though, maybe the whole, like, can we really play

35:14.980 --> 35:17.580
the games online virtual console?

35:17.580 --> 35:19.980
Like they said on the website, that's what I want to know.

35:19.980 --> 35:21.700
I'm going to write that down.

35:21.700 --> 35:22.700
Okay.

35:22.700 --> 35:28.780
I also would, would like to see better, like some kind of streaming incorporation too,

35:28.780 --> 35:32.260
you know, like, uh, kind of like how the PS four does.

35:32.260 --> 35:36.780
I mean, if you could take screenshots and post them, you know, what's to say they can't

35:36.780 --> 35:40.380
get like recordings eventually.

35:40.380 --> 35:42.620
And they're supposed to be doing something like that.

35:42.620 --> 35:48.940
So that's not a bad idea either streaming or, um, or like, you know how like you can

35:48.940 --> 35:52.860
record video in the Sims.

35:52.860 --> 35:57.060
So yeah, or like even Mario Kart, you could sort of do it even though Mario Kart kind

35:57.060 --> 35:58.060
of cheated.

35:58.060 --> 36:03.500
Mario Kart would, uh, do the replay in a higher rendering, uh, than the actual game was.

36:03.500 --> 36:06.300
But I mean, it's still, it worked very well.

36:06.300 --> 36:07.300
All right.

36:07.300 --> 36:09.300
Uh, let's wrap up.

36:09.300 --> 36:10.300
Let's wrap up.

36:10.460 --> 36:12.980
Get the last ones written down there and throw them in the time capsule and then we will

36:12.980 --> 36:15.900
seal it away to open up towards the end of the year.

36:15.900 --> 36:18.320
Fruit flavors of the cartridges.

36:18.320 --> 36:19.320
Fruit flavored cartridges.

36:19.320 --> 36:20.320
No, no, no, no.

36:20.320 --> 36:21.320
We don't want that.

36:21.320 --> 36:22.320
All right.

36:22.320 --> 36:25.160
Um, so yeah, let's go ahead and get those last few down.

36:25.160 --> 36:27.180
So Loki, what are you writing now?

36:27.180 --> 36:28.180
I've got three.

36:28.180 --> 36:29.180
All right.

36:29.180 --> 36:31.820
I bet the online services still shit.

36:31.820 --> 36:37.860
Um, no less than two Wii U remakes announced at E3.

36:37.860 --> 36:38.860
Okay.

36:39.860 --> 36:44.220
Dungeon Buster also suggested that we had our EA and Ubisoft still committed to making

36:44.220 --> 36:45.220
games for it.

36:45.220 --> 36:46.260
Ooh, I like that one.

36:46.260 --> 36:47.300
I like that one.

36:47.300 --> 36:49.740
Are EA and Ubisoft still committed to making games for the Switch?

36:49.740 --> 36:51.620
Are they committed to the games already?

36:51.620 --> 36:54.900
I mean, they were easily committed to the FIFA.

36:54.900 --> 36:59.620
So then they come out on stage though and do the whole, just like they did with Wii U.

36:59.620 --> 37:00.620
FIFA!

37:00.620 --> 37:01.620
FIFA!

37:01.620 --> 37:02.620
All right.

37:02.620 --> 37:03.620
That was it.

37:03.620 --> 37:04.620
All right.

37:04.620 --> 37:05.620
We're going to fill the, I don't want the segment to go on too long.

37:05.620 --> 37:08.660
So we're going to get the rest of it out there and put them in the time capsule and

37:08.660 --> 37:09.660
seal them away.

37:09.660 --> 37:10.660
Date it with today.

37:10.660 --> 37:11.660
All right.

37:11.660 --> 37:12.660
Well, we'll know when it was done.

37:12.660 --> 37:13.660
All right.

37:13.660 --> 37:14.660
I'm doing it anyway.

37:14.660 --> 37:16.660
It was a couple of days after the Switch was released.

37:16.660 --> 37:17.660
All right.

37:17.660 --> 37:19.220
I'm going to pass this down.

37:19.220 --> 37:23.000
And then just for fun, I'm not going to tell you what this one is because it really has

37:23.000 --> 37:26.580
nothing to do with games, but it's just a question I want to know the answer to.

37:26.580 --> 37:28.380
I want to see if we come back in December.

37:28.380 --> 37:31.780
I'll read this question in December when we open the capsule again.

37:31.780 --> 37:33.300
And no, my game won't be done by then.

37:33.300 --> 37:37.380
I'll show, I'll show my co-host what I'm going to put in there that has nothing to

37:37.380 --> 37:43.580
do with video games, but I'm just going to put that question there to see if come December,

37:43.580 --> 37:44.900
we find out what the answer is.

37:44.900 --> 37:48.180
I think we should each put in like, though, also, you know, when we add these later, we

37:48.180 --> 37:52.260
should also do like our top three things that we're playing this month.

37:52.260 --> 37:53.260
Okay.

37:53.260 --> 37:54.260
All right.

37:54.260 --> 37:55.900
We should do that on another piece.

37:55.900 --> 37:56.900
All right.

37:56.900 --> 37:57.900
Let's do that.

37:57.900 --> 37:59.020
We won't see all the time capsule yet.

37:59.020 --> 38:02.540
Let's do that when we come back for part B. We'll add those in here as well.

38:03.140 --> 38:04.140
All right.

38:04.140 --> 38:11.380
So, I'm going to add that last question in for me and everybody else.

38:13.780 --> 38:15.100
This is the best radio ever.

38:15.100 --> 38:16.100
I know, right?

38:16.100 --> 38:19.300
We should have probably done this before we went live tonight, but that's all right.

38:19.300 --> 38:22.820
Oh, sorry Dungeon Buster, we've already put up our papers.

38:22.820 --> 38:23.820
All right.

38:23.820 --> 38:24.820
Put them in.

38:24.820 --> 38:25.820
Here we go.

38:25.820 --> 38:26.820
All right.

38:26.820 --> 38:29.820
We're not going to seal the time capsule yet, but soon, because we'll come back and put

38:29.820 --> 38:33.620
in the games we're playing right now, a little later.

38:33.620 --> 38:34.620
Good Lord Loki.

38:34.620 --> 38:35.620
You could make that smaller pieces.

38:35.620 --> 38:36.620
Nope.

38:36.620 --> 38:37.620
All right.

38:37.620 --> 38:38.620
Well, we needed another part for the next question.

38:38.620 --> 38:39.620
No, we don't.

38:39.620 --> 38:41.620
Well, we have to put in the time capsule.

38:41.620 --> 38:44.620
I'll remember what I've been playing, because I'll be playing Skyrim by then.

38:44.620 --> 38:45.620
No, we'll have more.

38:45.620 --> 38:46.620
I have more paper over here.

38:46.620 --> 38:47.620
It's fine.

38:47.620 --> 38:48.620
All right.

38:48.620 --> 38:49.620
All right.

38:49.620 --> 38:50.620
Wasteful.

38:50.620 --> 38:51.620
All right.

38:51.620 --> 38:54.600
Speaking of things you're playing, let's talk about our gaming weeks.

38:54.600 --> 38:55.740
How is your gaming week?

38:55.740 --> 38:57.260
What types of video games have you been playing this week?

38:57.260 --> 38:58.260
Dark soccer.

38:58.260 --> 39:01.260
Well, it's kind of like Dan and I are both playing Breath of the Wild, because he misses

39:01.260 --> 39:02.260
a bunch of shit.

39:02.260 --> 39:03.260
So I'm like, hey, hubby.

39:03.260 --> 39:04.260
Did you see that?

39:04.260 --> 39:05.260
Did you see that?

39:05.260 --> 39:08.380
I bet you can steal that meat.

39:08.380 --> 39:10.420
Try shooting him in the head.

39:10.420 --> 39:11.420
You know, it's just like this.

39:11.420 --> 39:13.540
I'm like, no, you're ... Go the other way.

39:13.540 --> 39:16.580
I'm backseat driving Breath of the Wild right now.

39:16.580 --> 39:23.860
And wow, because I want to do the Gul'dan fight so much in every ... Okay.

39:23.860 --> 39:27.620
Every time I get in a group, and we get all the way through everybody, and everything's

39:27.620 --> 39:28.620
looking awesome.

39:28.620 --> 39:29.620
And then like, oh, we're tired.

39:29.620 --> 39:31.260
We don't want to do this one anymore.

39:31.260 --> 39:32.260
Quit.

39:32.260 --> 39:40.120
I want to beat the last ... Anyway, so I've been playing, and I have been playing a lot

39:40.120 --> 39:46.180
of Bust-A-Move lately, trying to beat my 2 million point score, which I haven't yet,

39:46.180 --> 39:49.860
because eventually I'll just go, oh, fuck this shit, and stop playing.

39:49.860 --> 39:55.340
And Pokemon Go, and Miitomo, just like to make outfits.

39:55.340 --> 39:57.860
I've so far made Katya in it.

39:57.860 --> 40:00.100
I've made Bianca Del Rio.

40:00.100 --> 40:01.100
I've made Lonk.

40:01.100 --> 40:02.100
I've made Petch.

40:02.100 --> 40:03.100
Lonk and Petch.

40:03.100 --> 40:07.860
Oh, so I thought you were going to just have a whole drag queen family, but you just did

40:07.860 --> 40:08.860
two.

40:08.860 --> 40:09.860
Yeah, I just did two.

40:09.860 --> 40:10.860
All right.

40:10.860 --> 40:11.860
I might make another one, though.

40:11.860 --> 40:15.560
I'm thinking about making Anjina, just because I want a bald me in there.

40:15.560 --> 40:16.560
So I don't know.

40:16.560 --> 40:21.620
I'm trying to think who else would be totally iconic in appearance.

40:21.620 --> 40:22.620
Maybe Violet Chachki.

40:22.620 --> 40:23.620
I don't know.

40:23.620 --> 40:28.300
But so far, I just have my favorites, Bianca and Katya.

40:28.300 --> 40:32.420
And then, although, okay, other complaint time.

40:32.420 --> 40:36.500
There's this person who's making this little tiny me called Alice, and I'm fucking sick

40:36.500 --> 40:42.500
of seeing Alice all over the fucking little fashion show crap that they have after you

40:42.500 --> 40:43.500
do the closet.

40:43.500 --> 40:44.500
Alice, stop.

40:44.500 --> 40:47.540
Get a life, girl.

40:47.540 --> 40:49.540
Seriously.

40:49.540 --> 40:52.540
Did Alice go away yet?

40:52.540 --> 40:55.820
All right.

40:55.820 --> 40:56.820
Anything else for game week?

40:56.820 --> 40:57.820
No.

40:57.820 --> 40:58.820
All right.

40:58.820 --> 40:59.820
Loki, how was your game week?

40:59.820 --> 41:02.100
It was just basically Skyrim.

41:02.100 --> 41:09.020
I played a little bit of Pokemon Go, just to, you know, I don't know, for some reason,

41:09.020 --> 41:14.500
kill time, because I'm in my car and driving relatively slow through an area that's full

41:14.500 --> 41:15.500
of Poke stops.

41:15.500 --> 41:17.380
You had to get a party Pikachu.

41:17.380 --> 41:21.060
I had to get a party Pikachu, but they don't have party Pikachus, because apparently Niantic's

41:21.060 --> 41:27.740
like, hey, we're going to release this Pikachu hat thing, and now we're going to make Pikachu

41:27.740 --> 41:29.940
never spawn ever again.

41:29.940 --> 41:35.300
I finally got my two Pikachus today, and I say two because one, I have to evolve to Raichu.

41:35.300 --> 41:38.860
I just had to drive around the neighborhood and just pull over at every Poke stop I knew

41:38.860 --> 41:40.380
of in every park.

41:40.380 --> 41:45.940
And finally, at one of the parks where there's a gym, there was a party Pikachu, and then

41:45.940 --> 41:49.660
as I was giving up, I was like, all right, I'm just going to have the one, I just won't

41:49.660 --> 41:50.740
have a Raichu, whatever.

41:50.740 --> 41:54.680
As I was driving home, at my home park here, it was on the radar.

41:54.680 --> 41:57.020
There was another party Pikachu, and I was like, yes.

41:57.020 --> 41:59.620
So I was able to get my Pikachus.

41:59.620 --> 42:00.620
Party.

42:00.620 --> 42:01.620
Party.

42:01.620 --> 42:05.900
But then, yeah, in Skyrim, I've been just doing the quest lines.

42:05.900 --> 42:11.700
So I finished the Thieves Guild stuff, which those radiant quests are fucking stupid.

42:11.700 --> 42:13.060
I'm so glad I'm done with that.

42:13.060 --> 42:17.580
And the fact that they had that actually based, you know, one of the achievements is based

42:17.580 --> 42:22.820
on doing like 20 of those was annoying, because they weren't hard at all.

42:22.820 --> 42:27.900
It was just annoying, because it's random, and you have to do five in each of the holds.

42:27.900 --> 42:31.980
And once you get down to that last hold, it's like, all right, I got to quit this.

42:31.980 --> 42:32.980
Do it again.

42:32.980 --> 42:33.980
Quit it.

42:33.980 --> 42:34.980
Do it again.

42:34.980 --> 42:35.980
Quit it.

42:35.980 --> 42:36.980
Do it again.

42:36.980 --> 42:37.980
Quit it.

42:37.980 --> 42:38.980
Oh, I finally got one for the hold I need.

42:38.980 --> 42:39.980
It was just irritating.

42:39.980 --> 42:46.140
And then, of course, I also finished the Mages College quest line as well.

42:46.140 --> 42:48.700
So I'm just going through some of that stuff.

42:48.700 --> 42:52.900
So next, I'll be doing the Dark Brotherhood, and maybe I'll finally do the mainline stuff.

42:52.900 --> 42:53.900
I don't know.

42:53.900 --> 42:54.900
But, yeah.

42:54.900 --> 42:55.900
That's it.

42:55.900 --> 42:57.260
All right.

42:57.260 --> 43:01.180
My gaming week, up until Friday, was pretty much a lot of the same old stuff I've been

43:01.180 --> 43:06.540
playing, like Final Fantasy XIV still, Overwatch, playing a little bit of that still, trying

43:06.540 --> 43:11.300
to get my loot box bonuses, forcing myself to play capture the flag mode, even though

43:11.300 --> 43:12.300
I really don't like it.

43:12.300 --> 43:16.460
But I did it once on PlayStation 4 and once on PC to get my extra loot boxes.

43:16.460 --> 43:21.220
So I kind of found that if I do Lucio and capture the flag, I don't feel so freaking

43:21.220 --> 43:24.340
useless because I'm healing.

43:24.340 --> 43:26.300
I'm decent enough with Lucio.

43:26.300 --> 43:30.140
I just can't really screw around with characters that are just fun to play right now.

43:30.140 --> 43:32.100
I like playing Sombra for fun.

43:32.100 --> 43:33.980
I'm not really good with her.

43:33.980 --> 43:34.980
Same thing with Ana.

43:34.980 --> 43:37.300
I like playing Ana for fun, even though I'm not really good with her.

43:37.300 --> 43:41.180
But Lucio, the nice thing is the healing thing is more like an aura, so you don't really

43:41.180 --> 43:42.180
have to think...

43:42.180 --> 43:45.380
He's kind of a little easier to play for that, so I feel like I'm more effective playing

43:45.380 --> 43:47.500
with Lucio.

43:47.500 --> 43:51.820
But then the other character I find that I'm getting better and better with, who I really

43:51.820 --> 43:55.900
didn't like at first, but now as I'm playing with her more, I'm really getting to like

43:55.900 --> 44:00.300
her is Mei, because I keep getting her in Mystery Heroes, and I can actually stay alive

44:00.300 --> 44:02.820
as Mei for a little while.

44:02.820 --> 44:07.980
Just being the covert Mei that everybody freaking hates coming up behind people, freeze!

44:07.980 --> 44:08.980
And then...

44:08.980 --> 44:09.980
I want to cosplay.

44:09.980 --> 44:10.980
I'm going to cosplay her.

44:11.780 --> 44:12.780
You should.

44:12.780 --> 44:13.780
I'm going to cosplay her.

44:13.780 --> 44:14.780
It's a cute outfit.

44:14.780 --> 44:15.780
In the winter.

44:15.780 --> 44:17.180
In the winter, yes.

44:17.180 --> 44:18.180
So that was that.

44:18.180 --> 44:20.700
And then of course, Friday, Nintendo Switch.

44:20.700 --> 44:23.460
So I've been playing this weekend.

44:23.460 --> 44:25.500
Just a little bit of fast racing remix.

44:25.500 --> 44:29.700
I just jumped into that just a little bit, probably not enough to really talk about impressions

44:29.700 --> 44:34.460
except for, yes, it's fast, and it looks very nice.

44:34.460 --> 44:38.380
I can tell it's a little better than the Wii U one, even though not like a huge difference,

44:38.380 --> 44:39.380
but you know, enough.

44:39.860 --> 44:42.700
But then I've been spending a lot of time this weekend with Zelda Breath of the Wild,

44:42.700 --> 44:47.580
which you know, it really is a pretty tremendous game.

44:47.580 --> 44:51.780
I mean, it's just, the scope of the game is gigantic.

44:51.780 --> 44:55.620
Like you just don't even really believe it at first, because you start in this one little

44:55.620 --> 44:59.140
area and you're like, oh, okay, this is like going to be the world that I'm playing in

44:59.140 --> 45:00.140
right here.

45:00.140 --> 45:03.300
And then you realize, oh no, that's just one little blip on the giant map.

45:03.300 --> 45:06.260
It's like, oh shit.

45:06.260 --> 45:10.740
The interesting thing about Breath of the Wild that I'm finding is the whole, like,

45:10.740 --> 45:14.340
how there's more than one way to solve a puzzle type of thing.

45:14.340 --> 45:16.780
That's very, very interesting.

45:16.780 --> 45:21.340
And I know there's a lot that's inspired by Zelda 1, because you might remember from the

45:21.340 --> 45:25.900
original original Zelda, the original Zelda didn't handhold you a whole lot.

45:25.900 --> 45:28.860
You kind of had to go find level one, obviously level one's easy.

45:28.860 --> 45:30.780
You had to go find level two, find level three.

45:30.780 --> 45:31.780
You could play them out of order.

45:31.780 --> 45:32.780
Yeah, you could.

45:32.780 --> 45:33.780
Well...

45:33.780 --> 45:34.780
Mostly.

45:34.780 --> 45:35.780
Mostly.

45:36.300 --> 45:37.300
You could play out of order.

45:37.300 --> 45:38.300
There were a couple you could play out of order.

45:38.300 --> 45:41.620
Like usually you would like, you have to get the raft to go to the next level and then

45:41.620 --> 45:42.620
you get...

45:42.620 --> 45:47.060
There's some like that, but there are a few, like I would think the first three, you don't

45:47.060 --> 45:48.620
need anything.

45:48.620 --> 45:49.620
Maybe bombs.

45:49.620 --> 45:50.940
No, you need bombs to beat some of the bosses.

45:50.940 --> 45:51.940
But anyway, like...

45:51.940 --> 45:56.660
You can go through the whole game without the sword until you get to the last level.

45:56.660 --> 45:57.660
Yes.

45:57.660 --> 45:59.060
And there are different ways to exploit it and so forth.

45:59.060 --> 46:04.400
So you know, and how did we, especially in the second quest of Zelda, where it's like

46:04.400 --> 46:09.580
you had to burn the fucking right tree or bomb just the right rock to find levels.

46:09.580 --> 46:13.380
Like you had to really talk to people and compare notes to figure these things out.

46:13.380 --> 46:18.180
And I see a lot of this in this Zelda game as well, except there might not necessarily

46:18.180 --> 46:20.940
be just one way to do it.

46:20.940 --> 46:24.520
Like I was talking a little bit about this on Bobby's show.

46:24.520 --> 46:27.800
One way to survive the cold might be to cook a meal.

46:27.800 --> 46:29.100
That's how I did it.

46:29.100 --> 46:30.820
Or you can find an item.

46:30.820 --> 46:34.440
That's how Shane did it when we were comparing notes talking on the phone.

46:34.440 --> 46:38.240
We might be to skin an enemy and wear his skin and coat.

46:38.240 --> 46:41.760
You have to cook their teeth and do an elixir or something.

46:41.760 --> 46:46.760
There's different ways to solve the problem, which kind of throws you off at first because

46:46.760 --> 46:50.940
sometimes we're used to video games being so linear that there's only one way, one solution

46:50.940 --> 46:51.940
to the problem.

46:51.940 --> 46:53.460
But Zelda is really not like that.

46:53.460 --> 46:58.960
And even Zelda, once you complete the beginning area, the little, I guess, tutorial area,

46:58.960 --> 47:03.620
for lack of a better term, once you beat that little area, you can go straight to the castle

47:03.620 --> 47:05.220
and try to beat the game.

47:05.220 --> 47:09.940
It's probably not going to go well for you, but theoretically you're supposed to be able

47:09.940 --> 47:11.540
to go to the castle and do what you need to do.

47:11.540 --> 47:15.680
I just, I don't know if it would really be possible without ultimate precision, but that's

47:15.680 --> 47:20.340
going to be the real fun to watch speed runners do later on.

47:20.340 --> 47:23.180
So anyway, yeah, there's just, there's more than one way to do things.

47:23.180 --> 47:29.040
And so, yeah, you really just kind of sit back and just enjoy the ride and just exploring

47:29.040 --> 47:30.240
these different areas.

47:30.240 --> 47:34.720
And there's that very Skyrim element to it where it's like in Skyrim, it's, oh, there's

47:34.720 --> 47:35.760
this side dungeon.

47:35.760 --> 47:36.760
What's going to be in here?

47:36.760 --> 47:38.800
Well, now it's, oh, there's this shrine.

47:38.800 --> 47:43.440
What's going to be over in here and, oh, I can chop down this tree or pick these plants

47:43.440 --> 47:45.680
or what can I cook?

47:45.680 --> 47:47.600
What do you mean nobody's going to tell me what to cook?

47:47.600 --> 47:48.820
Like I just have to figure it out.

47:48.820 --> 47:53.040
If I mix these ingredients together, I'm going to get this, or I compare notes with friends

47:53.040 --> 47:54.500
or I go online.

47:54.500 --> 47:57.180
That's part of the Breath of the Wild experience.

47:57.180 --> 48:04.480
But it's, it's, I think it is a truly an amazing accomplishment of a game.

48:04.480 --> 48:05.880
Probably going to be the game of the year.

48:05.880 --> 48:07.620
I should have put that in the time capsule.

48:07.620 --> 48:11.260
So a Zelda game of the year, because it probably already is.

48:11.260 --> 48:15.620
And the interesting thing to me is that honestly, I think probably the way I would describe

48:15.620 --> 48:21.180
Zelda Breath of the Wild is it's probably the best video game of the last generation

48:21.180 --> 48:23.120
because it is a Wii U game after all.

48:23.120 --> 48:25.920
It's the best video game of the last generation.

48:25.920 --> 48:27.780
It's probably where this game is going to end up.

48:27.780 --> 48:31.440
So it's an interesting, interesting way to kick off the Switch.

48:31.440 --> 48:36.080
But yeah, I mean, it's a stellar, stellar game and you don't even, I don't even think

48:36.080 --> 48:40.480
you need to be a huge Zelda fan to be into it because it doesn't really play a lot like

48:40.480 --> 48:41.680
the other Zeldas to me.

48:41.680 --> 48:44.780
I've always been a little eh with 3D Zeldas.

48:44.780 --> 48:47.240
Like I didn't get into Ocarina of Time the way everybody did.

48:47.240 --> 48:50.480
I know that's like sacrilege in some circles, but I didn't get into that.

48:50.480 --> 48:53.140
Yeah, the only one I've ever gotten into was Wind Waker.

48:53.140 --> 48:56.380
Uh, I liked Wind Waker HD and Twilight Princess on the Wii.

48:56.380 --> 48:59.700
I don't know if that was just the novelty of the Wii or all that, but that Twilight

48:59.700 --> 49:03.660
Princess kind of held my attention for a while for the 3D Zeldas and I really enjoyed that

49:03.660 --> 49:04.660
when it came out.

49:04.660 --> 49:05.660
But yeah.

49:05.660 --> 49:07.580
Uh, let's see.

49:07.580 --> 49:13.060
Looking in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com, Dark Tetsuya says the reviews I've seen it's

49:13.060 --> 49:14.900
getting nines and tens all over the place.

49:14.900 --> 49:15.900
Yeah.

49:15.900 --> 49:17.540
I mean, honestly it, it deserves it.

49:17.540 --> 49:21.280
And Dark Tetsuya says, yeah, speedrunners have a really weird order of doing the dungeons.

49:21.280 --> 49:25.760
Like if I recall correctly, they start with level three probably in the original Zelda.

49:25.760 --> 49:26.760
Probably.

49:26.760 --> 49:27.760
They probably do.

49:27.760 --> 49:28.760
Uh, come on.

49:28.760 --> 49:33.960
No Gus in chat says, I wish I could find like 20 arrows at a time instead of just five.

49:33.960 --> 49:35.840
There are places you can buy arrows.

49:35.840 --> 49:40.800
So my question is, because this looked absolutely annoying when I saw them talking about it,

49:40.800 --> 49:42.180
is the weapon durability.

49:42.180 --> 49:44.160
Is that fucking annoying?

49:44.160 --> 49:45.160
Yes.

49:45.160 --> 49:46.680
I don't have an, I don't have a nice way to say it.

49:46.680 --> 49:47.680
Yes.

49:47.680 --> 49:48.680
It's very annoying.

49:48.680 --> 49:49.680
Did you get the lightsaber yet?

49:49.680 --> 49:50.680
No.

49:50.680 --> 49:51.680
It's not the lightsaber.

49:51.680 --> 49:52.680
It's called like the guardian sword.

49:52.680 --> 49:53.680
Oh yes.

49:53.680 --> 49:54.680
That I had, I had it for like five seconds.

49:54.680 --> 49:55.680
And then it broke.

49:55.680 --> 49:56.680
Yeah.

49:56.680 --> 49:57.680
Or the, what?

49:57.680 --> 49:58.680
The eightfold sword.

49:58.680 --> 49:59.680
Yeah.

49:59.680 --> 50:00.680
That one was awesome.

50:00.680 --> 50:01.680
And it, it broke like five seconds later.

50:01.680 --> 50:04.080
The durability on the weapons is not so hot.

50:04.080 --> 50:08.760
And I, I don't know if there's a, because the, see, I got to watch my spoiler.

50:08.760 --> 50:11.360
So I'm going to really try to speak in vague terms.

50:11.360 --> 50:15.820
One of the other complaints I had in the beginning of the game was you can't even hold more than

50:15.820 --> 50:20.740
like four shields and with as fast as all these things break, what the F am I going

50:20.740 --> 50:21.740
to do?

50:21.740 --> 50:22.940
Like this is, this is crazy talk.

50:22.940 --> 50:28.300
Well, it turns out there are ways to work with that later on.

50:28.300 --> 50:30.820
So I'm hoping the weapon thing is the same thing.

50:30.820 --> 50:36.000
I could swear somebody was saying something on Twitter about that there is either you

50:36.000 --> 50:39.940
buy them or there's like a blacksmith who helps you make stronger ones.

50:39.940 --> 50:42.120
So maybe some of those issues will be resolved later on.

50:42.120 --> 50:43.660
I just haven't found the answer to that yet.

50:43.660 --> 50:44.660
And it is annoying.

50:44.660 --> 50:48.020
You should get that out of the game in the first place because weapon durability is just

50:48.020 --> 50:52.060
an artificial way to inflate the length of the game.

50:52.060 --> 50:55.260
Well, yes and no, I would say yes to that.

50:55.260 --> 51:00.620
If the game didn't hand out new weapons like candy, like the monsters will drop weapons

51:00.620 --> 51:03.980
and you can pick that weapon up and beat the shit out of them with that weapon.

51:03.980 --> 51:08.340
And, and that's that in some case with their own arm and yes, in some cases with their

51:08.340 --> 51:09.340
own arm.

51:09.340 --> 51:13.740
Um, and that, that also, by the way, that whole thing is really part of what makes this

51:13.740 --> 51:18.940
Zelda game quite tremendous is that like the detail that goes into that, like when

51:18.940 --> 51:24.620
you go and if you actually like pick up a weapon that's a monster was using, they'll

51:24.620 --> 51:27.500
actually point and go, what are you doing?

51:27.500 --> 51:28.500
Like that whole time.

51:28.500 --> 51:31.980
And they go, they scream at you like they throw it straight into their eyes.

51:31.980 --> 51:34.860
And that's when you throw it straight into their eye or you throw a bomb at them or something

51:34.860 --> 51:35.860
like that.

51:35.860 --> 51:41.340
And just, yeah, like the detail on the monsters and the way they kind of react to different

51:41.340 --> 51:42.340
situations.

51:42.340 --> 51:46.800
Like you could kind of watch them for a while and it's, it's, it's pretty neat.

51:46.800 --> 51:48.980
Like the level of detail that goes into that.

51:48.980 --> 51:54.300
So, uh, bonds double 06 says, so it's like border land, Zelda version.

51:54.300 --> 51:57.820
Um, that's not some Assassin's Creed, not too far off.

51:57.820 --> 52:00.360
It's that Borderlands is smart and didn't have weapon durability.

52:00.360 --> 52:03.340
So they win, uh, come on.

52:03.340 --> 52:05.740
No Gus says there's such a limited inventory though.

52:05.740 --> 52:08.820
It's just weird having to drop something to pick something else up.

52:08.820 --> 52:10.420
Yeah, it is a little weird.

52:10.420 --> 52:13.740
At least the materials don't seem to be limited on inventory.

52:13.740 --> 52:19.040
So I can pick up all the apples and plants and all that crap to my heart's content.

52:19.040 --> 52:21.720
It really just seems to be the weapons and shields and that type of stuff.

52:21.720 --> 52:25.500
So, but, uh, I'm enjoying it so far and I definitely want to play more of it.

52:25.500 --> 52:27.740
Um, that will probably fill my gaming time.

52:27.740 --> 52:30.060
Uh, although I don't know, a blaster master zero next week.

52:30.060 --> 52:31.060
I'm really looking forward to that.

52:31.060 --> 52:32.820
And I really hope that game doesn't let me down.

52:32.820 --> 52:37.340
Um, but then there's mass effect in three weeks, so we'll see.

52:37.340 --> 52:38.340
Anyway.

52:38.340 --> 52:39.340
All right.

52:39.340 --> 52:40.620
So that was my gaming week.

52:40.620 --> 52:45.220
Let's get to, uh, some housekeeping, visit on Twitter, twitter.com slash O L R. We're

52:45.220 --> 52:48.620
also on Facebook, facebook.com slash orange lounge radio.

52:48.620 --> 52:52.420
Um, I don't think we have any shows scheduled off for a bit.

52:52.420 --> 52:55.420
Uh, we'll, we'll still be here over the next few weeks.

52:55.420 --> 52:57.480
Um, yeah, I can't think of it.

52:57.480 --> 53:00.860
There's no, uh, expos I can think of that we're doing, uh, that I'm going to be gone

53:00.860 --> 53:05.020
all weekend except for the SAC indie arcade is, is starting to sneak up on us.

53:05.020 --> 53:06.160
That's April 8th.

53:06.160 --> 53:08.820
So that's like a month away at this point.

53:08.820 --> 53:09.820
Wow.

53:09.820 --> 53:10.820
And now I'm working on Saturdays.

53:10.820 --> 53:11.820
Oh no.

53:11.820 --> 53:15.020
You don't have to be able to do it with us.

53:15.020 --> 53:16.020
Oh shit.

53:16.020 --> 53:17.020
I didn't even think of that.

53:17.020 --> 53:19.700
Not unless I can come up, figure something out.

53:19.700 --> 53:20.700
All right.

53:20.700 --> 53:23.700
Well at least Loki and I'll be, Oh, you hope you're there or we're going to have room.

53:23.700 --> 53:24.700
I got to get away from the kids.

53:24.700 --> 53:25.700
Yes.

53:25.700 --> 53:26.700
I'll be there.

53:26.700 --> 53:29.540
The only two Saturdays that I were able to get off for to go see drag queens.

53:29.540 --> 53:34.060
Well, I'm seeing Bianca Del Rio and I'm going to the thing that they canceled in December

53:34.060 --> 53:36.660
or because of all the weather.

53:36.660 --> 53:39.140
Well, we'll, we'll see, we'll see.

53:39.140 --> 53:43.180
Hopefully our soccer can make it, but if not, it's April 8th is the, uh, indie arcade and

53:43.180 --> 53:45.340
Loki and I'll, we'll be there for sure.

53:45.340 --> 53:49.140
Hopefully our soccer or we'll have to get a stand in, uh, for that day.

53:49.140 --> 53:50.140
See what happens.

53:50.140 --> 53:51.140
Yeah.

53:51.140 --> 53:52.940
Uh, we'll be broadcasting from the event over in West Sacramento.

53:52.940 --> 53:55.700
Uh, so we had a lot of fun doing that the past couple of years.

53:55.700 --> 53:57.860
So I'm really looking forward to this year as well.

53:57.860 --> 54:02.100
Uh, so look forward to that, but otherwise I'm not traveling for anything until like

54:02.100 --> 54:03.100
dragon cons.

54:03.100 --> 54:04.100
The first thing on my agenda.

54:04.540 --> 54:07.900
I don't think I have, Oh, mag West is supposed to be a thing too.

54:07.900 --> 54:10.460
That's technically the week before dragon con.

54:10.460 --> 54:13.100
Um, but I don't have all the details on mag West yet.

54:13.100 --> 54:15.620
So two more to come on that.

54:15.620 --> 54:17.660
Let's get into some other gaming news.

54:17.660 --> 54:21.380
There's still a lot that happened this week outside of GDC and the switch, right?

54:21.380 --> 54:22.380
Yeah, there was.

54:22.380 --> 54:25.900
And then I was actually kind of surprised cause I was doing research on other stuff

54:25.900 --> 54:30.200
when I read this and I was like, Holy shit, this is pretty awesome.

54:30.200 --> 54:33.420
So Microsoft announced this Xbox game pass.

54:33.420 --> 54:39.140
It's a nine 99 a month service for Xbox one and PC that allows you to play a rotating

54:39.140 --> 54:45.060
catalog of downloadable, um, Xbox one and backwards compatible Xbox three 60 games.

54:45.060 --> 54:50.460
I didn't even realize you can play the Xbox three 60 games on the PC.

54:50.460 --> 54:51.460
I didn't eat.

54:51.460 --> 54:54.860
Well, you can do the whole streaming thing from your Xbox one.

54:54.860 --> 54:55.940
I have done that.

54:55.940 --> 54:59.460
I was playing dungeon siege three that way cause they were getting that away at one point

54:59.460 --> 55:01.900
how that works with some of these other ones, you know, whatever.

55:01.900 --> 55:03.280
Um, what the case may be.

55:03.280 --> 55:09.520
So basically it's a rotating, a catalog of a hundred titles from all different publishers,

55:09.520 --> 55:15.580
a two K Capcom, Sega Bandai Namco, THQ, deep silver, you know, blah, blah, blah.

55:15.580 --> 55:19.880
And some of the games they're kind of showing in their little graphic here, they have like

55:19.880 --> 55:27.760
halo five saints row, four mad max NBA, two K 16, uh, Lego Batman three, you know, it

55:27.760 --> 55:29.760
looks like some pretty decent titles.

55:29.760 --> 55:35.980
Um, it's going to be, you know, cycled out each month, so there'll be titles that rotate

55:35.980 --> 55:36.980
out of there.

55:36.980 --> 55:43.600
Um, it is basically said it's, um, I don't think you need to have Xbox live gold, but

55:43.600 --> 55:49.520
if you do have gold, you get, um, you can get to try this out before it actually launches.

55:49.520 --> 55:54.320
And then along with that too, they're going to be offering DLC a little bit cheaper if

55:54.320 --> 55:55.520
you do subscribe to this.

55:55.520 --> 55:59.700
So you'll be getting discounts off of, um, I think also probably full purchases of games

55:59.700 --> 56:00.920
as well.

56:00.920 --> 56:06.040
But honestly that is way better than fucking PlayStation now, as far as I'm concerned.

56:06.040 --> 56:10.000
Well, I was about to ask, what's the difference between the two, but PlayStation now is all

56:10.000 --> 56:11.920
PlayStation three and older stuff, right?

56:11.920 --> 56:13.720
There's nothing newer on it, right?

56:13.720 --> 56:14.720
Older games.

56:14.720 --> 56:17.160
And this is not streaming.

56:17.160 --> 56:18.160
This is downloading.

56:18.160 --> 56:19.160
Yeah.

56:19.160 --> 56:20.160
Okay.

56:20.160 --> 56:22.800
So you can download it and play it off your hard drive and you don't need to be connected.

56:22.800 --> 56:27.360
In fact, I believe they said, you know, you just need to connect once a month to, you

56:27.360 --> 56:29.800
know, keep utilizing those games.

56:29.800 --> 56:31.120
I think that's fantastic.

56:31.120 --> 56:35.520
That's the perfect Netflix way to address that.

56:35.520 --> 56:38.520
Why Sony hasn't done that beyond me.

56:38.520 --> 56:42.320
I mean, I think this is how they should treat, you know, well, this is going to light a fire

56:42.320 --> 56:43.320
for Sony to respond.

56:43.320 --> 56:48.120
That'll be definitely, they've been like kicking ass as far as backwards compatibility support.

56:48.120 --> 56:52.760
And now this service, I think that's pretty, that's a great revenue source and hello.

56:52.760 --> 56:58.720
Fucking Nintendo, dude, you have this catalog of like hundreds of virtual console games.

56:58.720 --> 57:01.400
You can't tell me you can't put out a service like this.

57:01.400 --> 57:03.680
Are you saying that your games are worse, more than this shit?

57:03.680 --> 57:09.640
I mean, to be fair, we don't know yet because virtual console, they might, I highly doubt

57:09.640 --> 57:10.640
it.

57:10.640 --> 57:15.220
I say that as I'm holding back laughter, but they technically Loki, we don't know.

57:15.220 --> 57:18.440
Technically we don't know because virtual console is now yet and they haven't announced

57:18.440 --> 57:22.240
what the virtual plan, a console plans are on the switch yet specifically.

57:22.240 --> 57:26.860
So they could do a Netflix style model still, and we don't know about it, but I know we're

57:26.860 --> 57:30.040
all kind of looking at it going, well, we all know what's going to happen to Rob.

57:30.040 --> 57:33.780
It's going to be five bucks again, unless maybe you get a credit for owning it before

57:33.780 --> 57:37.840
you can upgrade to a dollar and maybe the new little thing is that it has online.

57:37.840 --> 57:43.080
I think that's what we're all anticipating, but Hey, if this whole move that Microsoft

57:43.080 --> 57:47.760
is doing forces Nintendo to do a response, I kind of think Nintendo doesn't, I kind of

57:47.760 --> 57:51.720
think Nintendo can get away with doing what they've been doing as far as virtual console

57:51.720 --> 57:52.720
goes.

57:52.720 --> 57:58.680
I, I, I'm not thrilled about it either, but I, I think Nintendo can get away with it and

57:58.680 --> 57:59.680
they will.

57:59.680 --> 58:02.200
Of course they will.

58:02.200 --> 58:06.160
So and I probably am, aren't helping because I'll probably buy a lot of those games, at

58:06.160 --> 58:07.320
least the ones I want to play again.

58:07.320 --> 58:10.080
See now this won't be something that I'll be picking up, right?

58:10.080 --> 58:13.300
You know, well I don't have an Xbox one, so it's definitely not something to be paying

58:13.300 --> 58:17.160
for right away, but it might be something I'd be interested in maybe.

58:17.160 --> 58:22.400
Although then again, I do have a back catalog of over, you know, 200 games or about 200

58:22.400 --> 58:26.440
games on the PlayStation and 500 games on Steam.

58:26.440 --> 58:30.560
Yeah, I probably should play through some of those first before I'm getting more older

58:30.560 --> 58:31.560
games.

58:31.560 --> 58:34.600
And plus a lot of these that are showing in the rotation there were included in those

58:34.600 --> 58:40.440
like, you know, PlayStation plus, um, the Xbox live games of gold and stuff like that.

58:40.440 --> 58:43.120
So I may already have those in my catalog.

58:43.120 --> 58:48.660
Like I have NBA two K 16 on PlayStation, not that I'm really interested in playing it,

58:48.660 --> 58:49.660
but I've got it.

58:49.660 --> 58:50.660
Saints are a four.

58:50.660 --> 58:53.160
I bought, you know, Halo five would be fun.

58:53.160 --> 58:57.080
I think where this is going to really prove itself useful is that like, let's say you

58:57.080 --> 59:03.820
buy like a grand kid or a kid or whatever, like their first Xbox one console or something.

59:03.820 --> 59:08.180
This is a great way to have like an instant library of games to like catch up on stuff.

59:08.180 --> 59:12.540
I think that's where this is going to really, and it's probably where Microsoft's being

59:12.540 --> 59:18.480
smart with it because they want to lure more people and new people into Microsoft's, uh,

59:18.480 --> 59:19.580
you know, library.

59:19.580 --> 59:22.020
So this is a, this is a really neat way.

59:22.020 --> 59:23.020
And look at it this way.

59:23.020 --> 59:28.580
If you're like budget conscious, $10 a month is really not all that much.

59:28.580 --> 59:29.580
Not that bad.

59:29.580 --> 59:30.580
That's like lunch.

59:30.580 --> 59:31.700
I mean, that's, it's really not that bad.

59:31.700 --> 59:35.740
And I mean, if you're not looking to play like the newest, greatest thing.

59:35.740 --> 59:36.740
How much is the EA thing?

59:36.740 --> 59:40.500
Isn't the eighth EA thing like 20 is like much more than that.

59:40.500 --> 59:42.220
I want to say it's at least like 20 bucks.

59:42.220 --> 59:43.660
Does somebody in chat know the answer to that?

59:43.660 --> 59:44.660
How much is the EA thing?

59:44.660 --> 59:48.420
Yeah, I can look it up, but I want to see there's as much more than that.

59:48.420 --> 59:52.920
And that's kind of, I would assume no EA games on this service because EA wants you to use

59:52.920 --> 59:55.460
their more expensive thing for the EA game.

59:55.460 --> 59:56.980
I don't see EA on there.

59:56.980 --> 01:00:00.860
Um, I do see everybody else, but EA.

01:00:00.860 --> 01:00:01.860
What a shot.

01:00:01.860 --> 01:00:03.700
I don't care, honestly.

01:00:03.700 --> 01:00:05.700
Not missing it.

01:00:05.700 --> 01:00:07.300
All right.

01:00:07.300 --> 01:00:09.260
Uh, Jamie checking in with you real quick.

01:00:09.260 --> 01:00:16.300
Do you think there's a market for this type of Netflix style Xbox gaming thing?

01:00:16.300 --> 01:00:17.300
I guess.

01:00:17.300 --> 01:00:23.900
I mean, Netflix itself came really popular and killed Blockbuster.

01:00:23.900 --> 01:00:28.220
Netflix has the, even though we keep saying it's Netflix of games and stuff, it's like,

01:00:28.220 --> 01:00:32.900
it's the old Netflix of games because now I think Netflix has enough of its own original

01:00:32.900 --> 01:00:33.900
stuff.

01:00:33.900 --> 01:00:37.260
And that's, Netflix kind of knew it to their credit, kind of knew they had to go there.

01:00:37.260 --> 01:00:39.780
It's $4.99.

01:00:39.780 --> 01:00:41.340
The EA thing is only $4.99?

01:00:41.340 --> 01:00:42.900
$4.99 a month.

01:00:42.900 --> 01:00:43.900
Okay.

01:00:43.900 --> 01:00:49.500
Well, $4.99 a month, one publisher versus $9.99 a month, a lot of publishers.

01:00:49.500 --> 01:00:52.100
Well, Stan corrected and apologized to EA.

01:00:52.100 --> 01:00:54.240
I thought it was a lot more money when I went in there and looked.

01:00:54.240 --> 01:00:57.780
Maybe I was looking at some type of like three month pricing or something, but I'm okay with

01:00:57.780 --> 01:00:58.780
it.

01:00:58.780 --> 01:01:02.740
I mean, it'd be interesting, but I think a lot of people still like, you know, owning

01:01:02.740 --> 01:01:04.660
their thing too.

01:01:04.660 --> 01:01:05.660
That's very true.

01:01:05.660 --> 01:01:07.540
$4.99 a year.

01:01:07.540 --> 01:01:10.140
Oh, maybe that was something I was looking at.

01:01:10.140 --> 01:01:11.140
All right.

01:01:11.140 --> 01:01:12.140
Anyway.

01:01:12.140 --> 01:01:17.820
Um, still, I don't know if I myself would buy something like this, you know, just because

01:01:17.820 --> 01:01:22.620
I'm kind of like where, what Jamie said is that some people kind of like to own it and

01:01:22.620 --> 01:01:26.220
I feel like the games that are going to be in this are not going to be the newest stuff,

01:01:26.220 --> 01:01:28.660
which is usually going to be the stuff that I'm going to end up buying anyway.

01:01:28.660 --> 01:01:34.140
It's kind of like, I don't know, you know, when I was back, back when I had like the

01:01:34.140 --> 01:01:39.060
NES and the super NES, I was not all gung ho about owning stuff.

01:01:39.060 --> 01:01:42.300
It was just renting it then playing it and then being done with it.

01:01:42.300 --> 01:01:46.620
I think there's a lot of games that you could just get that experience where you just burned

01:01:46.620 --> 01:01:48.580
through it and then you're done with it.

01:01:48.580 --> 01:01:50.580
There's not a lot of replayability on them.

01:01:50.580 --> 01:01:52.220
That's a good point.

01:01:52.220 --> 01:01:53.220
We'll see.

01:01:53.220 --> 01:01:56.980
Uh, bonds, double O six and chat over at live.vog network.com says they won't get money for

01:01:56.980 --> 01:01:57.980
me.

01:01:57.980 --> 01:01:58.980
I'm sorry.

01:01:58.980 --> 01:02:02.260
Ninty and Sony 59 a year is enough for online features.

01:02:02.260 --> 01:02:06.740
Brad from pod culture pointing out Blockbuster killed Blockbuster, unnecessary 100 Matt saying,

01:02:06.740 --> 01:02:11.960
I'm sure come there E3 direct, we will know hopefully a lot more.

01:02:11.960 --> 01:02:12.960
So we'll see.

01:02:12.960 --> 01:02:17.300
Um, I, it sounds very interesting and I'd like to know exactly, you know, what that

01:02:17.300 --> 01:02:21.260
list of games is going to ultimately end up being when it first comes out.

01:02:21.260 --> 01:02:25.220
Um, I don't know if there's, I'm kind of like you, Loki, I have a big enough backlog as

01:02:25.220 --> 01:02:30.740
it is like, I would be, I would be amazed with myself if I actually am able to take

01:02:30.740 --> 01:02:33.860
the time to beat Zelda breath of the wild before something else comes out.

01:02:33.860 --> 01:02:34.860
Yeah.

01:02:34.860 --> 01:02:36.460
And I already have like a few EA tiles.

01:02:36.460 --> 01:02:40.440
Like I was looking at the other day, I was like, maybe I should install need for speed

01:02:40.440 --> 01:02:42.860
on my system or dragon age inquisition.

01:02:42.860 --> 01:02:48.980
I have these like games today, my catalog, they just haven't played to register participation

01:02:48.980 --> 01:02:52.280
for this week's episode of orange lounge radio at vog network.com.

01:02:52.280 --> 01:02:53.940
Use the passphrase trunk.

01:02:53.940 --> 01:02:57.880
All right, well moving on, let's get back to the switch for a minute because there's

01:02:57.880 --> 01:02:59.660
some other things going on.

01:02:59.700 --> 01:03:02.940
Maybe not just necessarily in the U S with the switch, you know, we talked a little bit

01:03:02.940 --> 01:03:06.780
about the U S has switched lineup, but, uh, in other countries, the lineup is a little

01:03:06.780 --> 01:03:07.780
bit different.

01:03:07.780 --> 01:03:13.600
And, uh, on the switch over in Japan, there's a game called voice or voice.

01:03:13.600 --> 01:03:18.500
I think it might be pronounced like voice or something voice, uh, it's V O E Z is the

01:03:18.500 --> 01:03:19.500
game.

01:03:19.500 --> 01:03:20.500
It's a rhythm music game.

01:03:20.500 --> 01:03:25.460
So right up our alley here at, uh, O L R there's 116 songs in this game and it's in Japan with

01:03:25.460 --> 01:03:28.380
the console's launch, but yours was interesting about the game.

01:03:28.380 --> 01:03:30.740
You can't play it in TV mode.

01:03:30.740 --> 01:03:33.780
The game is only for tablet mode.

01:03:33.780 --> 01:03:37.860
The reason why, because it's a touch screen music game.

01:03:37.860 --> 01:03:40.580
And when you're on the TV, there's no touch screen.

01:03:40.580 --> 01:03:42.680
There's no more infrared sensor bar or whatever.

01:03:42.680 --> 01:03:46.780
So you can't even really use motion controllers like a pseudo mouse or something like that

01:03:46.780 --> 01:03:47.780
to emulate touchscreen.

01:03:47.780 --> 01:03:48.780
I know.

01:03:48.780 --> 01:03:49.780
Right.

01:03:49.780 --> 01:03:50.780
So that's gone.

01:03:50.780 --> 01:03:55.100
So, uh, interesting that there are going to be games available on switch that will only

01:03:55.100 --> 01:03:56.660
be in the tablet mode.

01:03:56.660 --> 01:04:00.860
And you do see this, like even if you're browsing through the eShop, there's little icons that

01:04:00.860 --> 01:04:04.220
show you in what modes the game is playable.

01:04:04.220 --> 01:04:06.620
And one of them is the dock with the controller.

01:04:06.620 --> 01:04:10.540
One of them is just the two joy cons disconnected with the screen.

01:04:10.540 --> 01:04:13.480
And then the other is with the joy cons attached to the screen.

01:04:13.480 --> 01:04:17.380
So there's different icons that show up and pretty much everything out that's in the U

01:04:17.380 --> 01:04:18.940
S market supports all of them.

01:04:18.940 --> 01:04:20.940
So you don't even really notice it.

01:04:20.940 --> 01:04:24.560
Maybe if you own one, two switch, there's some mini games that will give you a sense

01:04:24.560 --> 01:04:28.440
of this, how not everything can be done in every configuration.

01:04:28.440 --> 01:04:33.620
But it is interesting that here we have a launch title nonetheless that won't play in

01:04:33.620 --> 01:04:35.240
one of the configurations.

01:04:35.240 --> 01:04:41.240
So it probably won't be the last of the switch titles to require the touch pad.

01:04:41.240 --> 01:04:46.720
Kind of interesting, but, um, yeah, I, I don't know again, how many games in the future are

01:04:46.720 --> 01:04:50.480
going to plan to do this, but, uh, we could see a few.

01:04:50.480 --> 01:04:56.120
So, um, I have not seen a lot of this game, but since it is a music game, I'm already

01:04:56.120 --> 01:04:57.400
interested a little bit.

01:04:57.400 --> 01:05:03.920
I do know it has a TBD date for the U S but if you really wanted to get this game again,

01:05:03.920 --> 01:05:07.400
because the Nintendo switch is region free, you can just make an account, you just make

01:05:07.400 --> 01:05:11.600
a second account on your system and set it to Japan or Europe.

01:05:11.600 --> 01:05:14.880
If you want to check out their store, obviously you have to pick a country, but you know,

01:05:14.880 --> 01:05:18.280
set it to Germany or, or, you know, something like that.

01:05:19.060 --> 01:05:23.080
And then you can go into their store and get their demos and their games and what have

01:05:23.080 --> 01:05:25.000
you. And apparently it's like really easy to do.

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:29.640
I've even seen people on my friends list that have stuff from the arcade archives, the Neo

01:05:29.640 --> 01:05:31.840
geo stuff that's out in Japan.

01:05:31.840 --> 01:05:32.840
That's not out here.

01:05:32.840 --> 01:05:34.120
I don't know if it was wild arms or something.

01:05:34.120 --> 01:05:35.120
I don't know what it was.

01:05:35.120 --> 01:05:39.340
Is that stuff like integrate with all your other games on like your little home screen

01:05:39.340 --> 01:05:42.320
or does that going to be different based on which account you're logged into?

01:05:42.320 --> 01:05:45.800
No, uh, then once you go back to your U S account, the game shows up there and it shows

01:05:45.800 --> 01:05:49.960
up in your, like, uh, the, the person I'm thinking of is captain spike from game buoy.

01:05:49.960 --> 01:05:55.160
If I go into his profile, you can see that he has the ACA Neo geo stuff right in there

01:05:55.160 --> 01:05:57.680
with Zelda one, two switch, whatever else he's playing.

01:05:57.680 --> 01:06:02.640
That's like, um, PlayStation, I think did that or something.

01:06:02.640 --> 01:06:03.640
Someone did it.

01:06:03.640 --> 01:06:04.640
Yeah.

01:06:04.640 --> 01:06:05.640
I think it was PlayStation.

01:06:05.640 --> 01:06:06.640
Yeah.

01:06:06.640 --> 01:06:08.400
So the region free is working very well, which does kind of beg the question.

01:06:08.400 --> 01:06:15.640
So why are we waiting so long to get voice here in the U S does that like English language

01:06:15.640 --> 01:06:16.640
support?

01:06:16.640 --> 01:06:19.760
Apparently you don't need to really understand, uh, Japan.

01:06:19.760 --> 01:06:20.760
Oh yeah.

01:06:20.760 --> 01:06:23.080
The game does have English language support apparently.

01:06:23.080 --> 01:06:24.920
So there's really, yeah, I know.

01:06:24.920 --> 01:06:25.920
Right.

01:06:25.920 --> 01:06:27.580
Is it, could it be a music license thing?

01:06:27.580 --> 01:06:32.100
I don't know if these 116 songs, if any of them are like, you know, Britney Spears type

01:06:32.100 --> 01:06:33.100
of thing.

01:06:33.100 --> 01:06:34.100
So there's music.

01:06:34.100 --> 01:06:35.100
I can't imagine.

01:06:35.100 --> 01:06:40.000
This sounds like a smaller indie title that long to new sharp licensing in other countries.

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:41.000
I would think.

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:42.000
Yeah.

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:43.000
I don't know.

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:44.000
So, Hmm.

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:45.000
Uh, interesting.

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:46.000
Uh, let's see.

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:50.760
Brad from pod culture says, uh, I'm calling it by the time switch to arrives the console

01:06:50.760 --> 01:06:52.760
and the handheld will be one biz.

01:06:52.760 --> 01:06:54.440
No more game boy slash DS.

01:06:54.440 --> 01:06:58.120
You're going to have to wait for the next time capsule next year, Brad.

01:06:58.120 --> 01:06:59.480
All right.

01:06:59.480 --> 01:07:02.160
Anyhow, uh, we'll keep you up to date.

01:07:02.160 --> 01:07:06.120
I'm not really going to go and make a Japanese account just to get this game.

01:07:06.120 --> 01:07:10.040
Um, cause there's plenty else to play right now, but I will be curious to check it out

01:07:10.040 --> 01:07:13.960
when it does come out in the U S meanwhile, dark Sakura.

01:07:13.960 --> 01:07:16.680
Another game we're looking forward to at least you and I are, even if everybody else

01:07:16.680 --> 01:07:19.920
has some soft core space porn.

01:07:19.920 --> 01:07:20.920
Okay.

01:07:20.920 --> 01:07:23.760
Well, it's just mass effect Andromeda.

01:07:23.760 --> 01:07:28.160
I mean, but we knew that there was going to be alien stripping going on.

01:07:28.160 --> 01:07:29.160
Right.

01:07:29.160 --> 01:07:40.040
So, um, there was a, uh, a post by Aaron Flynn, um, regarding, um, the, uh, uh, rating for

01:07:40.040 --> 01:07:41.040
a mass effect Andromeda.

01:07:41.040 --> 01:07:46.000
And there was the note that said, remember we lost the partial nudity rating and got

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:47.480
full nudity.

01:07:47.480 --> 01:07:53.560
Um, so basically he's just going back and forth with the, with the fans and pretty much

01:07:53.560 --> 01:07:54.560
responded.

01:07:54.560 --> 01:07:55.560
Yes.

01:07:55.560 --> 01:07:56.560
It's totally soft core space porn.

01:07:56.560 --> 01:07:57.560
It could be a joke.

01:07:57.560 --> 01:07:59.560
So that means we could get alien Dick.

01:07:59.560 --> 01:08:03.560
There's well, I don't know if it's going to be Dick or, or Bush or anything.

01:08:03.560 --> 01:08:05.200
I think it's going to be dead ass.

01:08:05.200 --> 01:08:06.720
We have alien twat.

01:08:06.720 --> 01:08:09.720
Like we had an, well, like in dragon age with Dorian, right?

01:08:09.720 --> 01:08:11.480
Was Dorian the only one that had booty?

01:08:11.480 --> 01:08:12.480
No.

01:08:12.480 --> 01:08:14.360
But like you totally saw ass.

01:08:14.360 --> 01:08:15.360
There was ass.

01:08:15.360 --> 01:08:17.600
Well you did actually in the first mass effect.

01:08:17.600 --> 01:08:19.040
Was there ass in the first mass effect?

01:08:19.040 --> 01:08:21.160
Um, for the lady romance.

01:08:21.160 --> 01:08:23.140
Oh, see, I never did the lady romance.

01:08:23.140 --> 01:08:27.080
You got shepherd's butt or Liara's butt, depending on who you were going with.

01:08:27.080 --> 01:08:30.320
Liara putting the ass in mass effect.

01:08:30.320 --> 01:08:35.800
I actually did like on my little lol effect thing, I did three cheers for shepherd's butt

01:08:35.800 --> 01:08:38.400
and posted shepherd's butt.

01:08:38.400 --> 01:08:46.520
So yeah, but there was also, um, apparently some really steamy, steamy dialogue and one

01:08:46.520 --> 01:08:50.360
that children shouldn't play under a certain age.

01:08:50.360 --> 01:08:56.720
Um, so yeah, it's, it's going to be, uh, the rating is going to be a little bit more on

01:08:56.720 --> 01:08:58.440
the adult level.

01:08:58.440 --> 01:09:04.640
Um, and it's going to be, uh, giving into what fans want, which is alien shtipping.

01:09:04.640 --> 01:09:05.640
Hooray.

01:09:05.640 --> 01:09:07.640
I can't wait.

01:09:07.640 --> 01:09:12.520
Uh, low key alien fucking isn't going to get you over to the mass effect franchise.

01:09:12.520 --> 01:09:13.520
That's a gimmick.

01:09:13.520 --> 01:09:16.480
I mean, I don't know.

01:09:16.480 --> 01:09:22.360
Fucking on a unicorn might give me the play Witcher three, but it's just at the end of

01:09:22.360 --> 01:09:23.360
the day, it's just a gimmick.

01:09:23.360 --> 01:09:27.600
I mean, it's just, I don't know if the game's good.

01:09:27.600 --> 01:09:28.600
Maybe.

01:09:28.600 --> 01:09:29.600
I didn't play any of the other ones.

01:09:29.600 --> 01:09:32.560
I just don't really feel the compulsion to play.

01:09:32.560 --> 01:09:33.880
There's enough porn on the internet.

01:09:33.880 --> 01:09:34.880
Okay.

01:09:35.240 --> 01:09:41.000
I don't need to play a game strictly for the soft core pornography, which payoff porn.

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:44.600
I'm just going to say, remember the very first time I played mass effect, I wrote it off

01:09:44.600 --> 01:09:46.080
and I was like, I don't, I'm not into this.

01:09:46.080 --> 01:09:47.080
What is this?

01:09:47.080 --> 01:09:51.960
And it wasn't until years later when Shane sat me down and said, no, you have to watch

01:09:51.960 --> 01:09:54.440
this and made me watch on YouTube.

01:09:54.440 --> 01:10:00.880
The Caden Shepard scene in mass effect three, I was like, I must play this game.

01:10:00.880 --> 01:10:02.280
I must play this entire game.

01:10:02.320 --> 01:10:08.360
I must lose 120 hours of my life to this franchise by playing it start to finish and a worth

01:10:08.360 --> 01:10:09.360
it.

01:10:09.360 --> 01:10:10.360
Thank you very much.

01:10:10.360 --> 01:10:11.360
All right.

01:10:11.360 --> 01:10:16.880
Uh, come on, no, Gus and chat says, I want Justin Trudeau to be a playable character

01:10:16.880 --> 01:10:19.080
in ass effect.

01:10:19.080 --> 01:10:23.400
The young Justin Trudeau, that's been making the rounds on a right on Twitter this week.

01:10:23.400 --> 01:10:25.600
I knew he had to have been pretty when he was young.

01:10:25.600 --> 01:10:26.600
Cause he's pretty now.

01:10:26.600 --> 01:10:30.600
I was going to say, not that he's bad looking plank.

01:10:30.600 --> 01:10:35.320
That means he's got core strength and that's important.

01:10:35.320 --> 01:10:38.640
All right, moving on Loki, something that's not porn.

01:10:38.640 --> 01:10:42.720
So Twitch is going to start selling games as well.

01:10:42.720 --> 01:10:47.920
Basically what's going to happen is if you're playing a game, you can have it where a developer

01:10:47.920 --> 01:10:51.840
can enable their game to be, um, sold on Twitch.

01:10:51.840 --> 01:10:56.280
So like say you see someone playing Overwatch, you can purchase Overwatch, um, developers

01:10:56.280 --> 01:10:58.360
are going to get 70% of the revenue.

01:10:58.360 --> 01:11:01.600
Um, streamers will get 5% of that.

01:11:01.600 --> 01:11:06.600
And then companies, I guess Ubisoft and telltale have already signed up.

01:11:06.600 --> 01:11:10.420
They're saying though, the games bought on Twitch can be played through the Twitch launcher

01:11:10.420 --> 01:11:17.200
through the developer slash publishers, existing services such as you play boo.

01:11:17.200 --> 01:11:19.000
You play boo.

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:20.360
That's not a positive.

01:11:20.360 --> 01:11:23.360
Nobody wants to play through you play ever.

01:11:23.360 --> 01:11:30.000
Um, esteem an option because like, boo, why the fuck would I, I mean, I decided to give

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:35.040
money to the, the streamer, which is just throw them like a donation or something if

01:11:35.040 --> 01:11:36.040
you're here and do that.

01:11:36.040 --> 01:11:37.040
But fuck that.

01:11:37.040 --> 01:11:40.040
I am not playing through you play for anything.

01:11:40.040 --> 01:11:41.400
It's vital by Ubisoft games.

01:11:41.400 --> 01:11:43.480
Here's the, here's the other question I have about all that.

01:11:43.480 --> 01:11:49.800
Cause when I was first reading about it, it was only partnered streamers get that 5% kickback.

01:11:49.800 --> 01:11:53.160
I don't know if they went back and changed it because I was like, yeah, it is only partnered

01:11:53.160 --> 01:11:54.360
streamers.

01:11:54.360 --> 01:11:58.120
So that's kind of a, that's kind of a dick.

01:11:58.120 --> 01:11:59.120
Exactly.

01:11:59.120 --> 01:12:01.780
Cause there's a lot of smaller streamers who aren't partnered.

01:12:01.780 --> 01:12:05.280
Why do suddenly they lose out on this?

01:12:05.280 --> 01:12:08.840
I don't understand that difference to drive that whole partnership thing.

01:12:08.840 --> 01:12:10.280
Honestly, you know what?

01:12:10.280 --> 01:12:14.840
5% revenue from something it's, you know what?

01:12:14.840 --> 01:12:15.840
It's going to take a while.

01:12:15.840 --> 01:12:16.840
I understand.

01:12:16.840 --> 01:12:19.560
Do, do the YouTube thing where it's, well, don't totally do the YouTube thing cause YouTube

01:12:19.560 --> 01:12:22.960
has its own issues, but the YouTube thing is what you don't get a check until you actually

01:12:22.960 --> 01:12:25.840
make a hundred dollars in revenue type of thing and do that sort of thing for the smaller

01:12:25.840 --> 01:12:26.840
people.

01:12:26.840 --> 01:12:30.120
Then if they're, if they're worried about that, like there's going to be streamers that

01:12:30.120 --> 01:12:35.400
just like don't ever make it, but it just, it just seems silly to, um, or just, you know,

01:12:35.400 --> 01:12:37.200
it's Ubisoft and telltale games.

01:12:37.200 --> 01:12:40.640
Do we really need to ha do you really need to purchase after Twitch?

01:12:40.640 --> 01:12:44.200
Have you not heard of like telltale games or Ubisoft games?

01:12:44.200 --> 01:12:47.000
Just fucking buy them through the respective platforms.

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:48.360
I mean, I don't know.

01:12:48.360 --> 01:12:49.360
What's what's the point.

01:12:49.600 --> 01:12:53.200
Do I still get my prime discount if I sell by the games this way?

01:12:53.200 --> 01:12:54.200
Probably not.

01:12:54.200 --> 01:12:55.200
Cause the prime discounts only when it's pre-orders.

01:12:55.200 --> 01:12:56.200
Huh?

01:12:56.200 --> 01:12:57.200
Does it work?

01:12:57.200 --> 01:12:58.600
No, it does work for games that are already out, right?

01:12:58.600 --> 01:13:00.280
I can't, I can't even remember.

01:13:00.280 --> 01:13:03.120
It's been so long since I bought a game after it was already out, but I think when I bought

01:13:03.120 --> 01:13:04.120
I think it's silly.

01:13:04.120 --> 01:13:10.040
I mean like, uh, why would I like if I was going to buy a telltale game through like,

01:13:10.040 --> 01:13:14.040
let's just say Twitch, okay, I'm gonna buy through Twitch.

01:13:14.040 --> 01:13:17.800
I'd just go buy it through Amazon if I was really going to do that since it's the same

01:13:17.800 --> 01:13:18.800
service anyways.

01:13:18.800 --> 01:13:20.480
At least then I'd probably get steam code.

01:13:20.480 --> 01:13:23.720
But don't you want to support your favorite streamer?

01:13:23.720 --> 01:13:24.720
You know what?

01:13:24.720 --> 01:13:27.760
There's a lot of ways to support my favorite streamer if I was going to do that.

01:13:27.760 --> 01:13:30.880
And fucking, this is not needed is what it is.

01:13:30.880 --> 01:13:36.600
It's not really needed because if I wanted to support them, what, 5% of a $20 game.

01:13:36.600 --> 01:13:37.800
I mean, what is that?

01:13:37.800 --> 01:13:38.800
Like a buck?

01:13:38.800 --> 01:13:39.800
Yeah.

01:13:39.800 --> 01:13:40.800
Throw them a dollar.

01:13:40.800 --> 01:13:44.240
If you really want to do that or throw them, you can, and plus, plus if you donated or

01:13:44.240 --> 01:13:48.680
subscribe to their channels, I'm like you get extra emoticons or whatever shit that

01:13:48.680 --> 01:13:50.480
they incentivize people with.

01:13:50.480 --> 01:13:56.160
I mean, I think that's more worthwhile than this nonsense where I have to play it through

01:13:56.160 --> 01:13:57.160
you playing it.

01:13:57.160 --> 01:13:59.240
I don't get steam code or some shit like that.

01:13:59.240 --> 01:14:00.240
Fuck that.

01:14:00.240 --> 01:14:01.780
No, I don't think so.

01:14:01.780 --> 01:14:06.680
I've been trying to do more and more streaming lately and build up my presence over on Twitch.

01:14:06.680 --> 01:14:08.160
Cheap plug, Rob Roberts.

01:14:08.160 --> 01:14:11.560
I don't really do the whole donations thing because I don't, I'm still kind of weirded

01:14:11.560 --> 01:14:13.120
out by the whole begging for money thing.

01:14:13.120 --> 01:14:14.200
For me.

01:14:14.200 --> 01:14:17.840
You do what works for you on your streams and the charity streams, of course, obviously

01:14:17.840 --> 01:14:19.960
I think those are great and so forth.

01:14:19.960 --> 01:14:25.840
I still have this weird area to like, do I want to make money off this?

01:14:25.840 --> 01:14:27.440
How do I do it?

01:14:27.440 --> 01:14:32.080
Feeling like I'm giving my viewers what they're paying for type of thing.

01:14:32.080 --> 01:14:36.560
Long story short, if you want to support me, send me food.

01:14:36.560 --> 01:14:37.560
I love food.

01:14:37.560 --> 01:14:38.560
Send me cookies.

01:14:38.560 --> 01:14:42.160
Send me, uh, I'll take Mountain Dew and Doritos.

01:14:42.160 --> 01:14:43.160
Fuck.

01:14:43.160 --> 01:14:44.160
I will.

01:14:44.160 --> 01:14:45.160
Just send me food.

01:14:45.160 --> 01:14:49.680
Or like in the case of this, like we're, let's say Girl Scout cookies are in season, Loki.

01:14:49.680 --> 01:14:53.580
You can do the Samoas or whatever they call them now, but there'll always be Samoas.

01:14:53.580 --> 01:14:56.980
Send me lots of Samoas.

01:14:56.980 --> 01:15:01.400
Or just like put yourself, like get a partner link for Amazon and just fucking link that

01:15:01.400 --> 01:15:05.880
shit in your channel instead and you probably more revenue from that stuff.

01:15:05.880 --> 01:15:08.320
I mean, why, why would you do this?

01:15:08.320 --> 01:15:09.320
I don't know.

01:15:09.320 --> 01:15:15.760
It's just, the only way it makes sense to me is if it's just automatic.

01:15:15.760 --> 01:15:19.760
Like it's like a thing that you can just tick a box or something like that and then when

01:15:19.760 --> 01:15:22.240
you play those games that it just happens to do that.

01:15:22.240 --> 01:15:27.780
But honestly, with the games that are streamed through Twitch, I don't think any of these

01:15:27.780 --> 01:15:31.840
are at the top or even anywhere near at the top of the list.

01:15:31.840 --> 01:15:35.960
Maybe, maybe with, um, you know, the new Ghost Recon game or something like that.

01:15:35.960 --> 01:15:41.800
But yeah, that's kind of a stretch for the rest of those.

01:15:41.800 --> 01:15:42.800
Let's see.

01:15:42.800 --> 01:15:47.280
Uh, some folks in chat over at live.vognetwork.com JD says Girl Scout cookies just ended last

01:15:47.280 --> 01:15:48.280
week.

01:15:48.280 --> 01:15:49.280
Why you gotta go and ruin everything JD?

01:15:49.280 --> 01:15:53.320
Why you gotta go, you gotta just, just take a big fat crap on this show.

01:15:53.320 --> 01:15:54.880
No, I'm just kidding.

01:15:54.880 --> 01:15:59.080
I, aren't they still trying, I know they're still trying to unload those cookies though.

01:15:59.080 --> 01:16:02.320
I've been seeing the statuses on Facebook, like who wants to buy these cookies?

01:16:02.320 --> 01:16:05.640
Uh, let's see, Brad from Paw Culture suggests Stroopwafel.

01:16:05.640 --> 01:16:09.080
Oh, now I like that idea, the Stroopwafel.

01:16:09.080 --> 01:16:14.040
Why not I could do a fund on Twitch to raise alcohol money.

01:16:14.040 --> 01:16:18.920
That's like, it's, it's like that honest, it's that quote unquote honest beggar that

01:16:18.920 --> 01:16:23.520
you see that says, you know, I just want to buy booze.

01:16:23.520 --> 01:16:26.520
You know, I'm gonna, I'm gonna give that guy a dollar cause you know what, he's, he's honest

01:16:26.520 --> 01:16:28.060
about what he's going for.

01:16:28.060 --> 01:16:30.700
So maybe, maybe that's what I need to do on, on Twitch.

01:16:30.700 --> 01:16:32.500
Just beg for alcohol money.

01:16:32.500 --> 01:16:37.540
Uh, come on, Noel Gus suggests that, uh, I'd send Sky some socks.

01:16:37.540 --> 01:16:39.220
Hey, you know, you know what?

01:16:39.220 --> 01:16:43.900
I, socks are awesome, especially like those, like the designer cute socks that you get

01:16:43.900 --> 01:16:46.060
like, like they have sock stores at the mall now.

01:16:46.060 --> 01:16:51.920
I got these, the socks that I'm wearing right now are these weird, like my mother-in-law,

01:16:51.920 --> 01:16:57.180
they went to, uh, Monterey and they brought me back socks for some reason.

01:16:57.180 --> 01:16:59.900
And I was like, what socks?

01:16:59.900 --> 01:17:00.980
I'm like, okay, thank you.

01:17:00.980 --> 01:17:01.980
Thank you.

01:17:01.980 --> 01:17:02.980
That's nice.

01:17:02.980 --> 01:17:06.740
But those socks are fucking comfortable.

01:17:06.740 --> 01:17:08.180
I wear them all the time.

01:17:08.180 --> 01:17:09.180
They're fucking warm.

01:17:09.180 --> 01:17:12.900
Those Donkey Kong socks from Vans are really cute.

01:17:12.900 --> 01:17:15.900
They're not anything special, but man, they are fucking comfortable.

01:17:15.900 --> 01:17:17.100
And why stop at socks?

01:17:17.100 --> 01:17:18.300
Why not underwear too?

01:17:18.300 --> 01:17:21.660
I mean, I'm not going to be able to show that off on Twitch cause that's a violation of

01:17:21.660 --> 01:17:24.660
the terms of service and let's both be thankful for that.

01:17:24.660 --> 01:17:28.860
But you and I'll know a little secret.

01:17:28.860 --> 01:17:32.860
I'm gaming very comfortably this week.

01:17:32.860 --> 01:17:34.860
All right.

01:17:34.860 --> 01:17:36.180
I took it to an awkward place.

01:17:36.180 --> 01:17:37.180
Sorry.

01:17:37.180 --> 01:17:42.780
Let's go to a news about Overwatch, a game that a lot of people are playing on Twitch.

01:17:42.780 --> 01:17:45.980
Are they going to be able to sell Overwatch on Twitch?

01:17:45.980 --> 01:17:46.980
Depends on Blizzard.

01:17:46.980 --> 01:17:50.220
I think, I think eventually they'll probably be like, fuck you guys.

01:17:50.220 --> 01:17:51.220
We don't need you.

01:17:51.660 --> 01:17:53.580
Overwatch sells itself.

01:17:53.580 --> 01:17:56.820
Blizzard has revealed its latest character.

01:17:56.820 --> 01:18:02.780
And as many people thought, the 11 year old girl that builds robots that they introduced

01:18:02.780 --> 01:18:08.300
last week, Effie, she is not the new hero, but she built the robot.

01:18:08.300 --> 01:18:09.300
Who is the hero?

01:18:09.300 --> 01:18:11.540
The new hero is Orisa.

01:18:11.540 --> 01:18:13.100
Orisa not Doomfist.

01:18:13.100 --> 01:18:19.100
A lot of people said, oh, maybe Effie like did something where she was creating something

01:18:19.100 --> 01:18:20.860
to help Doomfist or whatever.

01:18:20.860 --> 01:18:22.340
No, it's actually the opposite.

01:18:22.340 --> 01:18:29.540
Orisa was created to try to, I guess, stop Doomfist because Orisa was attacked by Doomfist.

01:18:29.540 --> 01:18:32.180
And so that's kind of how she fits into the story.

01:18:32.180 --> 01:18:36.660
I actually did play a little bit with Orisa on the test realm and I'm enjoying her as

01:18:36.660 --> 01:18:37.660
a character.

01:18:37.660 --> 01:18:41.660
She almost feels a little overpowered to me, but I think all new characters do at first.

01:18:41.660 --> 01:18:45.300
I was getting into a Twitter discussion about it and I was like, man, her barrier is like

01:18:45.300 --> 01:18:46.640
really strong.

01:18:46.640 --> 01:18:50.620
But then one of my friends was like, how easy would it be as Junkrat to just fire bombs

01:18:50.620 --> 01:18:52.580
right over the barrier or Pharah?

01:18:52.580 --> 01:18:54.460
That barrier ain't going to do shit to a Pharah.

01:18:54.460 --> 01:18:56.060
I was like, oh yeah, these are good points.

01:18:56.060 --> 01:18:59.500
So, you know, people will be kind of thinking of the different counters to Orisa.

01:18:59.500 --> 01:19:03.780
But Orisa is still fun to play and I think will be one of the more fun tank characters

01:19:03.780 --> 01:19:04.780
to play.

01:19:04.780 --> 01:19:05.780
So that's pretty cool.

01:19:05.780 --> 01:19:10.200
Bastion just got a lot of changes too in the most recent update in Overwatch.

01:19:10.200 --> 01:19:14.980
So yeah, Bastion, in fact, may be too powerful.

01:19:14.980 --> 01:19:18.740
Some people complaining and bitching and moaning on the forums because that's what people do.

01:19:18.740 --> 01:19:25.260
The Bastion is almost too powerful and you see Bastion in almost every game at this point.

01:19:25.260 --> 01:19:30.220
So there was actually one of the directors, Jeff Kaplan, from Overwatch actually went

01:19:30.220 --> 01:19:33.340
on to the Battle.net forum to kind of talk about what they were going to do with this.

01:19:33.340 --> 01:19:36.860
He actually said, over the past few nights I've played with and against Bastion.

01:19:36.860 --> 01:19:39.440
My perception is that he's a little too powerful right now.

01:19:39.440 --> 01:19:42.660
In particular, in one match I was playing Bastion and the enemy Tracer was trying to

01:19:42.660 --> 01:19:43.660
hunt me down.

01:19:43.660 --> 01:19:48.060
The Tracer player was clearly a better player than I am, a very skilled individual.

01:19:48.060 --> 01:19:52.400
I relied heavily on myself heal and the Tracer could not finish me off, but I was able to

01:19:52.400 --> 01:19:55.500
kill Tracer in recon mode almost through attrition.

01:19:55.500 --> 01:19:57.180
That part felt wrong to me.

01:19:57.180 --> 01:20:02.300
So interesting that the director gets in there, plays the game and even recognizes, even though

01:20:02.300 --> 01:20:05.540
he's the director, there's people at the game better than he is and that yeah, he should

01:20:05.540 --> 01:20:06.900
have lost that particular round.

01:20:06.900 --> 01:20:11.740
So I think they did make a small Bastion nerf in the most recently micro patch they just

01:20:11.740 --> 01:20:15.660
rolled out in the past couple days and they may do some more fine tuning with Bastion.

01:20:15.980 --> 01:20:20.620
But I mean the biggest thing they did is that Bastion's self heal you can use while moving

01:20:20.620 --> 01:20:24.460
now and like you can pretty much like bring yourself back up to full health as you're

01:20:24.460 --> 01:20:25.520
moving along the map.

01:20:25.520 --> 01:20:27.940
So it's pretty crazy what he can do.

01:20:27.940 --> 01:20:31.580
So I think they need to find like the right medium for that.

01:20:31.580 --> 01:20:33.940
But that's what's going on in Overwatch.

01:20:33.940 --> 01:20:39.100
So all right, moving on, DarkSakura.

01:20:39.100 --> 01:20:45.020
Well something that I think would make, well first of all, number one, it's making me happy

01:20:45.020 --> 01:20:53.460
and it would also make other fans of the series very happy is Danganronpa news, which

01:20:53.460 --> 01:20:56.780
you haven't played any of them yet, have you?

01:20:56.780 --> 01:20:57.780
No I have not.

01:20:57.780 --> 01:20:59.860
I hear you talk about them all the time, but I haven't played them.

01:20:59.860 --> 01:21:08.780
I got Shain in on it because he was wanting something to fill the, great now I can't think

01:21:08.780 --> 01:21:13.100
of it, Phoenix Wright itch and so Danganronpa was it.

01:21:13.100 --> 01:21:19.060
Anyway, Danganronpa V3 is going to be available on PC, they've confirmed.

01:21:19.060 --> 01:21:21.340
Spike Chunsoft has confirmed.

01:21:21.340 --> 01:21:27.860
So that means that it will be out on September 26th for that PS4 and Vita.

01:21:27.860 --> 01:21:34.460
And Spike Chunsoft itself is going to be doing the publishing for PC instead of NIS America,

01:21:34.460 --> 01:21:39.380
who's doing it for the Sony platforms.

01:21:39.380 --> 01:21:45.660
The other games were ported by Abstraction Games who did some pretty good stuff.

01:21:45.660 --> 01:21:51.240
So I'm really excited because I kind of didn't want to play it on something with a controller.

01:21:51.240 --> 01:21:58.420
I much prefer playing the Danganronpa series on my computer because then it's easier to

01:21:58.420 --> 01:22:01.540
pause, I can walk away from it, I don't hurt my hands so much.

01:22:01.540 --> 01:22:04.580
So for me, this is really good news.

01:22:04.580 --> 01:22:10.260
And then it's also easier of course to screenshot, so Danganronpa.

01:22:10.260 --> 01:22:13.660
One of those series I'll get into on a rainy day at some point.

01:22:13.660 --> 01:22:14.660
You should.

01:22:14.660 --> 01:22:17.500
So much stuff to play.

01:22:17.500 --> 01:22:19.100
There's better stuff to play.

01:22:19.100 --> 01:22:23.180
Alright, moving on, just a couple more stories for you guys.

01:22:23.180 --> 01:22:27.100
Then the classic game of the week, ooh and the classic game this week is a pretty good

01:22:27.100 --> 01:22:28.100
one.

01:22:28.100 --> 01:22:32.220
I mean I could say that every week but let's be real, she picks some real stinkers sometimes.

01:22:32.220 --> 01:22:33.900
And purpose.

01:22:33.900 --> 01:22:35.820
This one is a stinker but it's a good one.

01:22:35.820 --> 01:22:36.820
Anyway, I'll leave it at that.

01:22:36.820 --> 01:22:37.820
Loki.

01:22:37.820 --> 01:22:44.100
Alright, so GDC, they announced the new Xbox Live Creators Program.

01:22:44.100 --> 01:22:49.380
So what's kind of different than the current ID at Xbox program that they have right now

01:22:49.380 --> 01:22:52.660
is they're lowering the barrier of entries.

01:22:52.660 --> 01:22:56.640
So right now, and I think this is kind of what they hinted at before were any Xbox to

01:22:56.640 --> 01:22:58.540
be used as a dev kit.

01:22:58.540 --> 01:23:05.780
Anyone with an Xbox One in conjunction with different game engines like Construct 2, MonoGame

01:23:05.780 --> 01:23:14.060
and Unity, you can develop a game for it and the Windows 10 store with Xbox Live's integration

01:23:14.060 --> 01:23:19.780
and they also, with that, they're going to have their own sections in both of those stores.

01:23:19.780 --> 01:23:24.900
Microsoft does not have to provide concept approval for the game in order to appear on

01:23:24.900 --> 01:23:25.900
the store.

01:23:25.900 --> 01:23:26.900
Oh.

01:23:26.900 --> 01:23:27.900
Or, yeah.

01:23:28.260 --> 01:23:33.020
So, yeah, real easy barrier to entry there.

01:23:33.020 --> 01:23:35.500
So are we kind of getting back to the indie game thing then?

01:23:35.500 --> 01:23:38.100
That's what this is starting to sound like, yeah.

01:23:38.100 --> 01:23:43.340
But how do they know, because they used to have the peer review process, right, to kind

01:23:43.340 --> 01:23:44.340
of filter out some of the crap?

01:23:44.340 --> 01:23:46.820
I don't know if they're going to continue to have that.

01:23:46.820 --> 01:23:52.520
I would imagine that maybe they have some sort of review program in there.

01:23:52.520 --> 01:23:57.500
But yeah, you can already sign up for it in developer or Microsoft.com.

01:23:57.500 --> 01:24:00.380
It was the Xbox Live Creators Program.

01:24:00.380 --> 01:24:03.980
Which is why we are out there, because I need to know if this means we're getting Bungee

01:24:03.980 --> 01:24:06.740
Ferret tossing on Xbox One.

01:24:06.740 --> 01:24:10.060
That's what the minute I heard about this and the fact that, oh, it's Xbox One's answer

01:24:10.060 --> 01:24:13.280
to the indie games thing, that was the first question.

01:24:13.280 --> 01:24:17.100
Some of the other differences that are on this between the two different programs, because

01:24:17.100 --> 01:24:20.460
I'm not sure if they're going to keep both programs on there as well.

01:24:20.460 --> 01:24:23.020
Well, indie games is gone or they were there.

01:24:23.020 --> 01:24:24.020
All right.

01:24:24.020 --> 01:24:26.220
I know the indie games is gone, but they had ID at Xbox.

01:24:26.220 --> 01:24:27.860
So there's two different things right now.

01:24:27.860 --> 01:24:31.940
So yeah, I guess you can apply for either one.

01:24:31.940 --> 01:24:37.740
So the Creators Program, for example, the presence on the storefront is a little bit

01:24:37.740 --> 01:24:39.700
more basic.

01:24:39.700 --> 01:24:44.300
The multiplayer is not supported.

01:24:44.300 --> 01:24:47.740
And achievements are not supported.

01:24:47.740 --> 01:24:51.200
Which is, that was all in line with indie games, if I remember right.

01:24:51.200 --> 01:24:54.460
So you could do like leaderboards on indie games, maybe, but that was about it.

01:24:54.460 --> 01:24:55.460
Yeah, multiplayer, though.

01:24:55.460 --> 01:24:56.460
Did they?

01:24:56.460 --> 01:25:01.500
But wait, we heard Xbox Live integration, so that doesn't really seem to jive with that

01:25:01.500 --> 01:25:02.500
article.

01:25:02.500 --> 01:25:06.740
I think it's something like you can do leaderboards, but you can't do like full on frickin' like

01:25:06.740 --> 01:25:07.740
multiplayer at the same time.

01:25:07.740 --> 01:25:09.260
They have multiplayer, though, in indie games.

01:25:09.260 --> 01:25:12.100
Because I remember they have those really shitty Minecraft clones that you could do

01:25:12.100 --> 01:25:13.100
multiplayer in.

01:25:13.100 --> 01:25:14.100
I don't know.

01:25:14.100 --> 01:25:16.100
I mean, it's a neat idea.

01:25:16.100 --> 01:25:20.740
I'd be willing to check it out whenever I get an Xbox One.

01:25:20.740 --> 01:25:24.220
Okay, Bobby's helping out with some of the answers to the question I have about YYR.

01:25:24.220 --> 01:25:28.020
Bobby Blackwell says, he'd have to convert Bungee Ferret tossing to Unity and make it

01:25:28.020 --> 01:25:29.700
a universal Windows app.

01:25:29.700 --> 01:25:30.980
I forgot about that, of course.

01:25:30.980 --> 01:25:34.940
XNA was a whole other language that you could make, so that would be a challenge in itself.

01:25:34.940 --> 01:25:36.500
I get that.

01:25:36.500 --> 01:25:41.420
Bobby continues, you're creating universal Windows program apps with the Xbox One Creators

01:25:41.420 --> 01:25:45.580
Club, not actual Xbox One games, and XNA isn't supported.

01:25:45.580 --> 01:25:50.340
You could do leaderboards only, but not achievements, not sure about online play.

01:25:50.340 --> 01:25:52.020
So okay, that makes a little more sense.

01:25:52.020 --> 01:25:56.060
So this is where basically, but you could put, so hypothetically, you could put Time

01:25:56.060 --> 01:26:00.500
to Car on Xbox One, if you ever finished the fucking thing, because you did it in Unity.

01:26:00.500 --> 01:26:01.500
I could.

01:26:01.500 --> 01:26:03.220
I wouldn't want to.

01:26:03.220 --> 01:26:04.220
But you could.

01:26:04.220 --> 01:26:05.220
I could.

01:26:05.220 --> 01:26:06.220
You could.

01:26:06.220 --> 01:26:07.220
Or I could make just something else for it.

01:26:07.220 --> 01:26:09.220
I mean, yeah.

01:26:09.220 --> 01:26:12.540
I'm going to be very curious, especially now that we're going to be meeting with a ton

01:26:12.540 --> 01:26:15.840
of indie gamers in a month's time, I'm going to be very, I want to poll some of these folks

01:26:15.840 --> 01:26:21.220
to talk about, like, what is this going to mean for them and what they're doing?

01:26:21.220 --> 01:26:22.940
I'm very curious to hear that.

01:26:22.940 --> 01:26:23.940
So, yeah.

01:26:23.940 --> 01:26:24.940
All right.

01:26:24.940 --> 01:26:29.340
Well, we'll see what continues to develop with this and what indie folks we know that

01:26:29.340 --> 01:26:31.940
might take advantage of it.

01:26:31.940 --> 01:26:36.500
One other game that a lot of folks are still playing and getting ready for its sequel,

01:26:36.500 --> 01:26:38.020
which, you know, we know one's happening.

01:26:38.020 --> 01:26:41.440
We just don't know when exactly, but that's Destiny.

01:26:41.440 --> 01:26:46.380
So Destiny is a game that many people are still playing online and having a good time

01:26:46.380 --> 01:26:51.020
with, and some folks were ready for Destiny 2 to come out so they could take all that

01:26:51.020 --> 01:26:55.460
character and all the progress they've built and move it into Destiny 2, except Bungie

01:26:55.460 --> 01:26:59.400
said this week, it's not going to work that way, actually.

01:26:59.400 --> 01:27:06.140
The characters that you made in Destiny 1 will be reset going into the new game.

01:27:06.140 --> 01:27:11.020
So everything you've earned in Destiny, like your money, your points, and all that stuff,

01:27:11.020 --> 01:27:12.700
not going to happen.

01:27:12.700 --> 01:27:18.220
However, if you have, I guess, like, cool outfits and things like that, you can bring

01:27:18.220 --> 01:27:19.720
those over to Destiny 2.

01:27:19.720 --> 01:27:24.600
Some of that stuff will come over as far as the more look type of things.

01:27:24.600 --> 01:27:30.780
But your powers, your possessions, Eververse-related items and currency will be stuck in the first

01:27:30.780 --> 01:27:31.780
game.

01:27:31.780 --> 01:27:32.780
That's it.

01:27:32.780 --> 01:27:36.640
Personalizations, if you got past level 20 and did the Black Garden story mission, that

01:27:36.640 --> 01:27:38.300
will carry over.

01:27:38.300 --> 01:27:43.000
Some people kind of see that as a little harsh reboot, but at the same time, I kind of look

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:44.800
at this and go, it is a separate game, though.

01:27:44.800 --> 01:27:48.500
If Destiny 2 is supposed to be a separate game, they want everybody to start over.

01:27:48.500 --> 01:27:51.540
That's part of the reason I haven't really got back into Destiny myself is because I

01:27:51.540 --> 01:27:55.540
played it in the very beginning and, you know, it was fun, but then I didn't really have

01:27:55.540 --> 01:27:58.300
time for all these expansions and things like that.

01:27:58.300 --> 01:28:01.000
And now it's like, well, I don't really want to get back into it because everybody else

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:02.740
is like so far along.

01:28:02.740 --> 01:28:06.940
So Destiny 2 is going to kind of hit the reset button on that a little bit, I think.

01:28:06.940 --> 01:28:09.260
I guess it's like EverQuest 1 and EverQuest 2, right?

01:28:09.260 --> 01:28:12.720
Your characters didn't really carry over there either, but that ended up being a bad thing

01:28:12.720 --> 01:28:18.000
for EverQuest 2 because a lot of folks wanted to stay behind and play EverQuest 1.

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:20.880
You could look at Final Fantasy 11 and 14 kind of the same way.

01:28:20.880 --> 01:28:24.120
Not everybody, you know, the two games don't really have anything in common.

01:28:24.120 --> 01:28:28.360
There's some people, not a ton, but some people who stayed behind and would rather play the

01:28:28.360 --> 01:28:30.420
older game.

01:28:30.420 --> 01:28:31.420
But I don't know.

01:28:31.420 --> 01:28:34.360
Destiny is also much different than your other traditional MMOs.

01:28:34.360 --> 01:28:38.520
I don't know if Destiny is going to have that same problem that those other games I mentioned

01:28:38.520 --> 01:28:41.920
had because it's still going to be a very similar type of game.

01:28:41.920 --> 01:28:47.780
So anyway, Kaijuto does bring up an interesting counterpoint, though, going, didn't they

01:28:47.780 --> 01:28:50.940
sell Destiny as this ongoing story that you live in?

01:28:50.940 --> 01:28:53.540
Oh yeah, it was that whole 10-year plan for Destiny.

01:28:53.540 --> 01:28:54.540
Remember that?

01:28:54.540 --> 01:28:59.020
Well, that doesn't sound like it worked out so well.

01:28:59.020 --> 01:29:01.100
Kind of like the PlayStation 4's 10-year life cycle.

01:29:01.100 --> 01:29:03.860
Well, I mean, it sort of worked out.

01:29:03.860 --> 01:29:09.620
I mean, if we want to not consider this new console a new console.

01:29:09.620 --> 01:29:13.700
Here's the thing, too, with Destiny is that they would probably tell you that Destiny

01:29:13.700 --> 01:29:16.260
2 is part of that life cycle.

01:29:16.260 --> 01:29:19.240
And there are some things you're carrying over.

01:29:19.240 --> 01:29:21.420
You're carrying the essence of your...

01:29:21.420 --> 01:29:22.420
Oh, fuck them.

01:29:22.420 --> 01:29:24.340
The essence, Loki.

01:29:24.340 --> 01:29:30.420
The essence, the O'Day character is coming over from the original Destiny.

01:29:30.420 --> 01:29:32.420
That's what you get.

01:29:32.420 --> 01:29:34.940
All right.

01:29:34.940 --> 01:29:35.940
You know what?

01:29:35.940 --> 01:29:41.140
We need to take a trip down memory lane, back to simpler times.

01:29:41.140 --> 01:29:46.220
When there was no expectation of this online system and things that carried over, you play

01:29:46.220 --> 01:29:49.220
the game, you beat it, and then you threw it in the trash.

01:29:49.220 --> 01:29:50.220
Just kidding.

01:29:50.220 --> 01:29:51.220
You didn't do that.

01:29:51.220 --> 01:29:54.540
You put it in the gaming vault where DarkSakura walks into every week to find a game that

01:29:54.540 --> 01:30:01.500
she thinks, hey, look, brats, put down your Switch.

01:30:01.500 --> 01:30:02.500
Why don't you switch?

01:30:02.500 --> 01:30:03.500
I'll switch you.

01:30:03.500 --> 01:30:04.500
I'll switch you.

01:30:04.500 --> 01:30:06.420
Go pick your own Switch.

01:30:06.420 --> 01:30:10.140
And here it is, the classic game of the week, DarkSakura.

01:30:10.140 --> 01:30:12.740
What is the classic game that the kids should be playing this week?

01:30:12.740 --> 01:30:13.740
Night Trap.

01:30:13.740 --> 01:30:14.740
Oh, God.

01:30:14.780 --> 01:30:16.700
Maybe kids actually shouldn't be playing this game.

01:30:16.700 --> 01:30:17.900
No, they shouldn't be playing it.

01:30:17.900 --> 01:30:23.100
Actually, it's really not that great of a game, but it's iconic, I will say.

01:30:23.100 --> 01:30:25.980
Yes, it is a legendary video game, if nothing else.

01:30:25.980 --> 01:30:28.780
Starring the late Dana Plato.

01:30:28.780 --> 01:30:29.780
R.I.P.

01:30:29.780 --> 01:30:36.100
Who had a shithole of life after different strokes, but still.

01:30:36.100 --> 01:30:41.380
It is an interactive movie game that was done by Digital Pictures for the Sega CD, and it

01:30:41.380 --> 01:30:45.380
came out in North America on October 15th, 1992.

01:30:45.380 --> 01:30:51.700
It had ports for the Sega 32X, the 3DO, MS-DOS, and Mac OS.

01:30:51.700 --> 01:30:59.060
It was basically 90 minutes of full motion video that basically the advent of the CD

01:30:59.060 --> 01:31:02.220
ROM pretty much is what made a game like this possible.

01:31:02.220 --> 01:31:09.340
So basically, the plot of the game is that these young women of various states of dress

01:31:09.380 --> 01:31:14.460
are the targets of these things called augurs, who are vampiric kind of beings who want to

01:31:14.460 --> 01:31:16.740
steal their blood.

01:31:16.740 --> 01:31:20.860
And so you have to switch between these different hidden cameras and activate traps to catch

01:31:20.860 --> 01:31:24.300
them to save the women.

01:31:24.300 --> 01:31:29.900
Now the thing that makes this game notable, even though it's not that great of a game,

01:31:29.900 --> 01:31:35.880
is that it was really a source of controversy, because in 1993, people had an even bigger

01:31:35.880 --> 01:31:40.800
stick up their ass, and it was really mature, really mature.

01:31:40.800 --> 01:31:45.280
There was a bathroom scene where the girl's wearing a towel, and she screams for like

01:31:45.280 --> 01:31:49.560
seven minutes with a pipe in her throat, well, the little augur thing.

01:31:49.560 --> 01:31:52.600
They like this hook that goes around your throat, and it looks like it's got a pump

01:31:52.600 --> 01:31:53.600
attached to it.

01:31:53.600 --> 01:31:54.600
Okay, gross, gross, gross.

01:31:54.600 --> 01:31:56.360
Yeah, anyway.

01:31:56.360 --> 01:32:03.000
In the US, it was actually one of the games that contributed to the creation of the ESRB,

01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:05.680
the Entertainment Software Rating Board.

01:32:05.680 --> 01:32:10.560
In the UK, it got a 15 rating.

01:32:10.560 --> 01:32:13.700
So basically back to Night Trap, the game itself.

01:32:13.700 --> 01:32:24.200
So you have an undercover agent whose name is Kelly, played by Dana Plato, who has infiltrated

01:32:24.200 --> 01:32:26.080
one of these parties.

01:32:26.080 --> 01:32:32.600
And these women are staying at Mr. and Mrs. Martin's house, and they seem like a normal

01:32:32.600 --> 01:32:36.600
family, but five other girls who had stayed at this house before disappeared, so why other

01:32:36.600 --> 01:32:40.360
people are wanting to go the fuck to this house, I have no idea.

01:32:40.360 --> 01:32:49.300
And so they send in the Sega Control Attack Team, also SCAT, on other systems it was changed

01:32:49.300 --> 01:32:57.960
to Special Control Attack Team, so yes, the SCAT team sends Kelly in, and you are monitoring

01:32:57.960 --> 01:32:59.720
the whole situation through hidden cameras.

01:32:59.720 --> 01:33:03.160
I don't even know how the fuck they got the hidden cameras in the house, but you know,

01:33:03.160 --> 01:33:05.000
a lot of magic.

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:09.080
Finally some actual people too, like the whole first five minutes of this was just watching

01:33:09.080 --> 01:33:14.600
these guys get, fall through trap doors, and fall through curtains and things like that.

01:33:14.600 --> 01:33:17.640
But now we actually, I was like, where's the chicks in bikinis?

01:33:17.640 --> 01:33:18.640
Where's that part?

01:33:18.640 --> 01:33:21.880
And now we're finally at least seeing people, even though these are not.

01:33:21.880 --> 01:33:25.360
I was promised girls in panties, pillow fighting.

01:33:25.360 --> 01:33:30.920
Where is that?

01:33:30.920 --> 01:33:38.840
The game is called the trap em up genre, so you have the events that are going on in different

01:33:38.840 --> 01:33:44.220
areas of the house, and you can only view one at a time, and so you can actually see

01:33:44.220 --> 01:33:49.160
the augers creep into the house, and you have to spot them and use traps to capture them,

01:33:49.160 --> 01:33:58.280
they have to get to certain places and you trigger the trap kinda, I mean, kinda like

01:33:58.280 --> 01:34:03.980
Dragon's Lair, I guess, a little bit, but more like, more timed in certain places, so.

01:34:03.980 --> 01:34:08.680
We need a crossover between this and Five Nights at Freddy's.

01:34:08.680 --> 01:34:09.680
They've gone into the wrong house.

01:34:09.680 --> 01:34:11.680
Five Nights at Scaddy's.

01:34:11.680 --> 01:34:17.280
Anyway, you, the way that you do, actually, I don't think it would be too off from Five

01:34:17.280 --> 01:34:19.840
Nights at Freddy's, just a little bit less interactive.

01:34:19.840 --> 01:34:23.000
You know, it's more scripted, I think, than this, where Five Nights at Freddy's tends

01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:25.120
to be a bit more random.

01:34:25.120 --> 01:34:33.720
But anyway, you have access codes that pop up on the screens, and the codes change the

01:34:33.720 --> 01:34:38.120
different parts of the course of the game, so you have to keep the accurate code by listening

01:34:38.120 --> 01:34:45.080
to the different conversations, and so you actually have to play the game multiple times

01:34:45.080 --> 01:34:47.800
to get what these codes are.

01:34:47.800 --> 01:34:54.040
The game is real-time, it cannot be rewound, and if you miss too many of the augurs, the

01:34:54.040 --> 01:34:58.440
game will end, or if certain characters are taken away, or if the host of the slumber

01:34:58.440 --> 01:35:02.320
party disconnects your access to the traps.

01:35:02.320 --> 01:35:06.600
You know, there's even, like, one part where, like, your boss in the control center cans

01:35:06.600 --> 01:35:13.200
you, for sucking, he yells at you for letting all those poor, poor half-naked women die.

01:35:13.200 --> 01:35:14.740
Aw.

01:35:14.740 --> 01:35:21.980
So it was actually filmed in Culver City, three weeks in 1987, and it was originally

01:35:21.980 --> 01:35:29.980
developed for Hasbro's control vision video game system that was codenamed Nemo, and it

01:35:29.980 --> 01:35:33.340
used VHS tapes instead of ROM cartridges.

01:35:33.340 --> 01:35:38.820
But Hasbro discontinued the production, and so the footage went into an archive until

01:35:38.820 --> 01:35:43.060
the founders of Digital Pictures purchased it in 1991.

01:35:43.060 --> 01:35:49.740
So they imported everything over for a CD-ROM format, put it out on the Sega CD, and then

01:35:49.740 --> 01:35:54.820
later there was the 32X, 3DO, and PC versions that had higher quality.

01:35:54.820 --> 01:35:58.900
There also was a Mac OS version.

01:35:58.900 --> 01:36:04.540
You had, for actors in there, you also had, apart from Dana Plato, you had Arthur Burghardt,

01:36:04.540 --> 01:36:08.060
Blake Gibbons, and Andrus Jones, which I don't know what else the fuck they were in.

01:36:08.060 --> 01:36:09.700
I've never heard any of those people.

01:36:09.700 --> 01:36:12.220
I was just looking at the names of the actors, I was like, who are they?

01:36:12.220 --> 01:36:15.100
The only one I recognize is Dana Plato.

01:36:15.100 --> 01:36:20.220
So with the release, basically the mentions of Sega products were removed from the 3DO

01:36:20.220 --> 01:36:28.500
and PC and Mac versions, so they actually replaced some of the videos with the original

01:36:28.500 --> 01:36:34.540
footage that was made for the first release for the Hasbro control vision.

01:36:34.540 --> 01:36:42.120
Some of the other versions were also giving higher quality video, because the Sega CD

01:36:42.120 --> 01:36:47.000
didn't really have the best resolution for video.

01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:53.480
The 3DO version had an on-screen map with the color codes for the different rooms.

01:36:53.480 --> 01:37:01.080
The PC and Mac one had a save function within the game, and a pause menu, so you could look

01:37:01.080 --> 01:37:03.560
at the house on the pause menu.

01:37:03.560 --> 01:37:11.560
It also had the documentary called Dangerous Games that was about this game and the controversy

01:37:11.560 --> 01:37:12.560
around it.

01:37:12.560 --> 01:37:23.880
There was also never released footage for the VHS-1 that is viewable on the Sega CD

01:37:23.880 --> 01:37:28.480
version by entering a button code, and the credits will read, In Memory of Steven D.

01:37:28.480 --> 01:37:31.600
Hasenfeld.

01:37:31.600 --> 01:37:37.640
The footage is basically Hasbro executives looking at the original version's scene of

01:37:37.640 --> 01:37:42.640
the crime back in 1987.

01:37:42.640 --> 01:37:49.040
In 2014, the creator of Night Trap said he wanted to re-release it with better resolution

01:37:49.040 --> 01:37:50.040
and gameplay.

01:37:50.040 --> 01:37:56.440
There was a Kickstarter out for it, but the developers said that if it was successful,

01:37:56.440 --> 01:38:02.580
that they would have done other of the Digital Pictures title, or making a sequel to the

01:38:02.580 --> 01:38:03.880
game.

01:38:03.880 --> 01:38:08.960
There is a mobile prototype that showed up on YouTube, but nothing else about it.

01:38:08.960 --> 01:38:13.280
The game actually sold really well, but because of the controversy over it, it only had an

01:38:13.280 --> 01:38:15.600
initial print run.

01:38:15.600 --> 01:38:17.800
It was a best seller in the UK.

01:38:17.800 --> 01:38:26.400
However, ratings themselves were pretty, pretty, I'd say on the low end.

01:38:26.400 --> 01:38:31.240
But it was novel that they were using live actors and that you had to play through the

01:38:31.240 --> 01:38:37.080
game multiple times to see everything, so it had great replayability.

01:38:37.080 --> 01:38:46.840
Electronic Games give them an 89% overall, but EGM, Electronic Games Monthly, gave it

01:38:46.840 --> 01:38:51.760
a really mediocre review.

01:38:51.760 --> 01:38:58.020
It's kind of not so great, really.

01:38:58.020 --> 01:39:02.380
People who have reviewed it since then just really gave it a kind of snore rating.

01:39:02.380 --> 01:39:09.820
And Night Trap was voted the 12th worst video game of all time in an EGM article.

01:39:09.820 --> 01:39:16.700
And yeah, basically, it's just, you know, it wasn't all that great.

01:39:16.700 --> 01:39:21.740
But like I said, still novel for a time, and the big thing about it is the controversy.

01:39:21.740 --> 01:39:32.300
So in 1993, right before Christmas, the game was removed from shelves at Toys R Us and

01:39:32.300 --> 01:39:38.700
KB after they received complaints that were part of, as they figured out after the fact,

01:39:38.700 --> 01:39:44.180
it was a type of telephone campaign, but they still stalked Mortal Kombat and other violent

01:39:44.180 --> 01:39:45.180
games.

01:39:45.180 --> 01:39:53.360
That actually led to a 1993 joint State Judiciary and Government Affairs Committee having a

01:39:53.360 --> 01:39:55.800
hearing on the video games.

01:39:55.800 --> 01:40:00.700
And so basically, it was announced later that there would be a censored version.

01:40:00.700 --> 01:40:07.460
But no, the ones that were co-chairing this was Joseph Lieberman and Herbert Kohl, who

01:40:07.460 --> 01:40:11.860
thought it was shameful, ultra-violent, sick and disgusting, and encouraged an effort to

01:40:11.860 --> 01:40:12.860
trap and kill women.

01:40:12.860 --> 01:40:16.380
Like, people don't know it's a fucking video game.

01:40:16.380 --> 01:40:18.340
But it made, like, all the news everywhere.

01:40:18.340 --> 01:40:23.900
I even remember this, you know, as a teen, you know, that it was in USA Today, it was

01:40:23.900 --> 01:40:29.860
in New York Times, Washington Post, the local papers, it was all over the place.

01:40:29.860 --> 01:40:36.900
And it was also pretty much, I mean, the characters in the games, and this is actually outlined

01:40:36.900 --> 01:40:45.880
in that Dangerous Games documentary that's also in the PC version, is that the producers

01:40:45.880 --> 01:40:51.540
and the cast members said that they thought that it was for the sake of, to prevent the

01:40:51.540 --> 01:40:56.420
trapping and killing of women, and that the blood draining device was intended to look

01:40:56.420 --> 01:40:59.580
unrealistic, which honestly, it looks fucking unrealistic.

01:40:59.580 --> 01:41:04.180
Like I was like, how the fuck is that a thing, really?

01:41:04.180 --> 01:41:10.580
But then, you know, there's no nudity in the game, or no extreme violence.

01:41:10.580 --> 01:41:14.820
But people were saying, oh no, it's really, it's violent, I mean, they might be scantily

01:41:14.820 --> 01:41:16.900
clad, but they weren't fucking naked.

01:41:16.900 --> 01:41:18.980
You know, it's just boobs.

01:41:18.980 --> 01:41:19.980
What the hell.

01:41:19.980 --> 01:41:20.980
Everyone's got boobs.

01:41:20.980 --> 01:41:21.980
There's worse in movies.

01:41:21.980 --> 01:41:22.980
Men have boobs.

01:41:22.980 --> 01:41:23.980
Okay?

01:41:23.980 --> 01:41:24.980
Everyone's got boobs.

01:41:24.980 --> 01:41:31.380
Anyway, there were a lot of people who just thought that it was a really sexist game.

01:41:31.380 --> 01:41:38.820
I mean, yeah, I think that it is a bit, yeah, it's sexist, I mean, it's meant to play on

01:41:38.820 --> 01:41:44.220
the whole horror movie genre with the, you know, girls in pillow fights and bikinis and

01:41:44.220 --> 01:41:45.220
shit like that.

01:41:45.220 --> 01:41:52.220
But at the same time, it wasn't overt, you know, it's not like it was a snuff game, you

01:41:52.220 --> 01:41:53.220
know.

01:41:53.220 --> 01:41:59.220
At any rate, the game did get ported even after the controversy.

01:41:59.220 --> 01:42:09.540
The ports were done in 1994, and later on the MS-DOS and Mac versions were out in 1995.

01:42:09.540 --> 01:42:14.300
They had a different cover on each of them, but all of them had pictures of Dana Plato

01:42:14.300 --> 01:42:19.300
on it, which the Sega CD one was purely illustrated.

01:42:19.300 --> 01:42:22.060
So and that's it, Night Trap.

01:42:22.060 --> 01:42:28.020
I actually really want to see the documentary now though, because I knew about it, but I

01:42:28.020 --> 01:42:29.020
hadn't seen it.

01:42:29.820 --> 01:42:32.620
All right, there it is, your classic game of the week.

01:42:32.620 --> 01:42:34.500
But is it a classic though?

01:42:34.500 --> 01:42:35.500
Night Trap.

01:42:35.500 --> 01:42:38.900
Well, no, it absolutely changed gaming.

01:42:38.900 --> 01:42:44.500
I mean, even though it's a ridiculous freaking game, it did change gaming for better or for worse.

01:42:44.500 --> 01:42:49.860
And that's, you know, one of the things about the classic game segment is not just an outline,

01:42:49.860 --> 01:42:53.380
oh, this game was great, it's an instant classic and blah, blah, blah.

01:42:53.380 --> 01:42:55.580
It's a classic like the Mustang.

01:42:55.580 --> 01:43:01.460
It's also how did it contribute to gaming and I will interspace shitty games that contributed

01:43:01.460 --> 01:43:02.460
to gaming.

01:43:02.460 --> 01:43:03.460
Of course.

01:43:03.460 --> 01:43:04.460
So there you go.

01:43:04.460 --> 01:43:05.460
Of which there's been plenty.

01:43:05.460 --> 01:43:08.900
And this is actually even considered the same genre as Lode Runner.

01:43:08.900 --> 01:43:09.900
Why?

01:43:09.900 --> 01:43:11.260
Because it's a trap game.

01:43:11.260 --> 01:43:12.860
Oh, God.

01:43:12.860 --> 01:43:15.420
That's a stretch in my opinion.

01:43:15.420 --> 01:43:17.340
I guess puzzle games, maybe.

01:43:17.340 --> 01:43:18.340
I don't know.

01:43:18.340 --> 01:43:19.340
Anyway.

01:43:19.340 --> 01:43:20.340
All right.

01:43:20.340 --> 01:43:23.100
There it is, your classic game of the week, Night Trap starring Dana Plato.

01:43:23.100 --> 01:43:24.100
Rest in peace.

01:43:24.140 --> 01:43:25.140
We're going to take a break.

01:43:25.140 --> 01:43:26.660
When we come back from the break, we're going to continue it.

01:43:26.660 --> 01:43:29.420
We're going to finally seal this time capsule away.

01:43:29.420 --> 01:43:32.220
And then we're going to get into some rapid fire news.

01:43:32.220 --> 01:43:36.700
Your calls pretty soon here at Orange Lounge Radio on Skype when we come back after this

01:43:36.700 --> 01:43:39.140
break with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:43:45.140 --> 01:43:48.380
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.

01:43:48.380 --> 01:43:53.780
Live tonight, March the 5th of 2017 with episode number 678 of our show already in

01:43:53.780 --> 01:43:54.780
progress.

01:43:54.780 --> 01:43:58.940
Now, I want to give a quick shout out to our pals over at Anime Jam Session, also here

01:43:58.940 --> 01:44:00.220
on the Voice of Geeks Network.

01:44:00.220 --> 01:44:04.060
Now, I falsely said a couple of weeks ago that they were going to be having their 300th

01:44:04.060 --> 01:44:06.580
episode because I figured, well, what comes after 299?

01:44:06.580 --> 01:44:07.580
300.

01:44:07.580 --> 01:44:11.260
Well, I got fooled because they actually had a 299.5.

01:44:11.260 --> 01:44:14.620
And then as Rama said when he called in the show last week, they took a week off.

01:44:14.620 --> 01:44:19.060
But episode 300 is finally happening with Anime Jam Session this Tuesday.

01:44:19.060 --> 01:44:21.540
So y'all should check it out live.

01:44:21.540 --> 01:44:22.540
Be here.

01:44:22.540 --> 01:44:23.540
All right.

01:44:23.540 --> 01:44:24.540
Are you going to check it out, Dark Sakura?

01:44:24.540 --> 01:44:26.540
You need to be there for Ran-chan.

01:44:26.540 --> 01:44:27.540
Maybe.

01:44:27.540 --> 01:44:28.540
Maybe.

01:44:28.540 --> 01:44:31.820
Well, if you can't be here live, there's always the podcast feed.

01:44:31.820 --> 01:44:32.820
Yes.

01:44:32.820 --> 01:44:33.820
You can always check that out.

01:44:33.820 --> 01:44:36.660
All the shows that make up the Voice of Geeks Network, you can check out their podcast feeds

01:44:36.660 --> 01:44:38.940
over at vognetwork.com and all the way to the shows.

01:44:38.940 --> 01:44:41.220
Sometimes work gets in the way, that nasty necessity.

01:44:41.220 --> 01:44:42.220
Oh, yeah.

01:44:42.220 --> 01:44:43.220
That whole thing.

01:44:43.820 --> 01:44:45.420
Man, if only we could just ban work.

01:44:45.420 --> 01:44:46.420
All right.

01:44:46.420 --> 01:44:49.020
Before we get into rapid fire news, we need to finish the time capsule.

01:44:49.020 --> 01:44:52.620
So somebody had that idea of putting in, what is it?

01:44:52.620 --> 01:44:53.620
What are we putting in here?

01:44:53.620 --> 01:44:55.740
The three games we just can't stop playing right now?

01:44:55.740 --> 01:44:56.740
Yeah.

01:44:56.740 --> 01:44:58.020
To see if that changes by the end of the year.

01:44:58.020 --> 01:44:59.020
Yeah.

01:44:59.020 --> 01:45:00.020
All right.

01:45:00.020 --> 01:45:02.020
So even though Loki's like, I don't want to fill it out, then put one-

01:45:02.020 --> 01:45:03.020
What the fuck were we thinking?

01:45:03.020 --> 01:45:06.260
Then put one Skyrim, two Skyrim, three Skyrim.

01:45:06.260 --> 01:45:08.620
You get this tiny piece of paper to write on, Loki.

01:45:08.620 --> 01:45:09.620
All right.

01:45:09.620 --> 01:45:10.620
All right.

01:45:10.620 --> 01:45:11.620
And make sure to sign it because I don't know who's going to do what.

01:45:11.620 --> 01:45:12.620
All right.

01:45:13.020 --> 01:45:16.300
So I'm going to put number one, obviously it will be Final Fantasy 14 because I play

01:45:16.300 --> 01:45:17.300
way too much of that.

01:45:17.300 --> 01:45:22.540
I was going to see if I ever beat Danganronpa 2, which I'm still halfway through.

01:45:22.540 --> 01:45:28.580
Number two, I'm going to put Overwatch because I do play a lot of that with Alan.

01:45:28.580 --> 01:45:32.540
I want to know if Alan's still playing Overwatch 2 at that point.

01:45:32.540 --> 01:45:34.900
Now the third one's a little harder to pick.

01:45:34.900 --> 01:45:36.820
What am I obsessed with right now?

01:45:36.820 --> 01:45:38.980
I'm not sure what I play.

01:45:38.980 --> 01:45:42.500
I mean, like obviously this particular weekend I've been playing a lot of Breath of the

01:45:43.380 --> 01:45:44.380
Wild, but does that count?

01:45:44.380 --> 01:45:45.380
Yeah.

01:45:45.380 --> 01:45:50.540
Can I put number three, overcome with anticipation for Mass Effect Andromeda?

01:45:50.540 --> 01:45:53.220
Maybe we could do a second list of what we're looking forward to this year.

01:45:53.220 --> 01:45:54.220
Okay.

01:45:54.220 --> 01:45:56.220
That time capsule is only so big and we don't want that segment to be our own.

01:45:56.220 --> 01:45:58.220
We'll just use little pieces of paper, Loki.

01:45:58.220 --> 01:45:59.660
Let's see.

01:45:59.660 --> 01:46:10.780
I'm just going to put, um, I'm just going to put number three, um, overcome with feelings

01:46:10.780 --> 01:46:15.980
about Andromeda.

01:46:15.980 --> 01:46:18.980
I'll just put Breath of the Wild, even though I'm not playing that yet.

01:46:18.980 --> 01:46:19.980
But you're not playing it.

01:46:19.980 --> 01:46:20.980
You're cheating.

01:46:20.980 --> 01:46:22.980
But I will be in like a couple of weeks.

01:46:22.980 --> 01:46:23.980
All right.

01:46:23.980 --> 01:46:24.980
All right.

01:46:24.980 --> 01:46:25.980
Overcome with feelings about Andromeda.

01:46:26.300 --> 01:46:33.260
D.S. was the gay sex good?

01:46:33.260 --> 01:46:34.260
Question mark.

01:46:34.260 --> 01:46:37.300
That's an important question I want to answer in December, right?

01:46:37.300 --> 01:46:41.500
I just put OMG Mass Effect Andromeda in big letters, but since I'm playing through Breath

01:46:41.500 --> 01:46:43.660
of the Wild is sort of an afterthought.

01:46:43.660 --> 01:46:44.660
Right.

01:46:44.660 --> 01:46:49.300
Oh, I should, even though I totally know my own handwriting, I will still sign this with

01:46:49.300 --> 01:46:53.060
my name there.

01:46:53.060 --> 01:46:54.300
Fold it up.

01:46:54.300 --> 01:46:55.300
Put it in the time capsule.

01:46:55.620 --> 01:46:56.620
Okay.

01:46:56.620 --> 01:46:57.620
What'd you put on your list?

01:46:57.620 --> 01:46:58.620
Dark Sakura.

01:46:58.620 --> 01:46:59.620
Um, I put World of Warcraft.

01:46:59.620 --> 01:47:00.620
Okay.

01:47:00.620 --> 01:47:01.620
Yeah.

01:47:01.620 --> 01:47:02.620
You have been playing.

01:47:02.620 --> 01:47:06.020
I should specify that it's Legion, although they haven't announced the next, uh, thing.

01:47:06.020 --> 01:47:09.580
They probably will at the next BlizzCon just in time for the end of the year.

01:47:09.580 --> 01:47:12.940
Danganronpa 2, cause I haven't beaten it yet and I'm still trying to.

01:47:12.940 --> 01:47:14.940
And then Breath of the Wild cause Dan and I are doing it together.

01:47:14.940 --> 01:47:17.060
And then in big letters, I did OMG Mass Effect Andromeda.

01:47:17.060 --> 01:47:18.060
Okay.

01:47:18.060 --> 01:47:19.940
So you actually, you actually did put three games.

01:47:19.940 --> 01:47:21.380
Now what'd you put, Loki?

01:47:21.380 --> 01:47:25.060
Skyrim Remastered, Until Dawn, Rush of Blood, and Skyrim Remastered.

01:47:25.060 --> 01:47:26.060
Okay.

01:47:26.060 --> 01:47:27.060
Good enough.

01:47:27.060 --> 01:47:28.060
All right.

01:47:28.060 --> 01:47:29.060
I accept that answer.

01:47:29.060 --> 01:47:30.060
I didn't put my name on there, but I mean.

01:47:30.060 --> 01:47:31.060
Fine.

01:47:31.060 --> 01:47:32.060
We'll deal with it.

01:47:32.060 --> 01:47:33.060
Is it Skyrim?

01:47:33.060 --> 01:47:34.060
We know it's you.

01:47:34.060 --> 01:47:35.060
If it's Skyrim, we know it's you.

01:47:35.060 --> 01:47:36.060
Or Alan snuck one in there.

01:47:36.060 --> 01:47:37.060
All right.

01:47:37.060 --> 01:47:38.060
So here we go.

01:47:38.060 --> 01:47:39.060
Let's make the seal it away.

01:47:39.060 --> 01:47:40.060
Tape it.

01:47:40.060 --> 01:47:41.060
Noises.

01:47:41.060 --> 01:47:42.060
You're sealing it away.

01:47:42.060 --> 01:47:43.060
I don't want to go get tape.

01:47:43.060 --> 01:47:44.060
Tape it.

01:47:44.060 --> 01:47:45.060
Tape it.

01:47:45.060 --> 01:47:47.660
And you know what's funny is as I'm talking to this, I just realized we have a whole like

01:47:47.660 --> 01:47:50.300
Tootsie Roll thing that we're holding the pens in, but this works great.

01:47:50.300 --> 01:47:51.300
But that one doesn't have a lid.

01:47:51.300 --> 01:47:52.300
It doesn't have a lid.

01:47:52.300 --> 01:47:53.780
It doesn't have any Tootsie Rolls in it.

01:47:53.780 --> 01:47:54.780
Where are we?

01:47:54.780 --> 01:47:55.780
Oh yeah.

01:47:55.780 --> 01:47:56.780
Where are we going to put candy?

01:47:56.780 --> 01:47:58.260
We're going to put a Tootsie Roll in there.

01:47:58.260 --> 01:48:01.420
And some of my hair to see what color it is.

01:48:01.420 --> 01:48:02.780
I sealed it away.

01:48:02.780 --> 01:48:04.620
So there's a hole on the top.

01:48:04.620 --> 01:48:05.620
Done.

01:48:05.620 --> 01:48:06.620
All right.

01:48:06.620 --> 01:48:07.620
There it is.

01:48:07.620 --> 01:48:08.620
All right.

01:48:08.620 --> 01:48:09.620
So where am I going to put this now?

01:48:09.620 --> 01:48:10.620
I guess I'll just put it here.

01:48:10.620 --> 01:48:11.620
Yep.

01:48:11.620 --> 01:48:12.620
There.

01:48:12.620 --> 01:48:13.620
It'll sit.

01:48:13.620 --> 01:48:14.620
To be opened December 2017.

01:48:14.620 --> 01:48:15.620
We should cover it with like stickers.

01:48:15.620 --> 01:48:16.620
Like randomly.

01:48:16.620 --> 01:48:17.620
All right.

01:48:17.620 --> 01:48:18.620
There it is.

01:48:18.620 --> 01:48:19.620
Come on.

01:48:19.620 --> 01:48:20.620
No Gus suggests lick it shut.

01:48:20.620 --> 01:48:21.620
No.

01:48:21.940 --> 01:48:24.140
I haven't decided if I'm licking Rob's cartridges yet.

01:48:24.140 --> 01:48:27.980
Apparently I saw a picture of someone's dog that did shoot up one of those cartridges.

01:48:27.980 --> 01:48:29.980
So that stuff doesn't really seem to stop dogs.

01:48:29.980 --> 01:48:31.900
Yeah, but dogs also have weird senses of taste.

01:48:31.900 --> 01:48:32.900
It doesn't affect pets.

01:48:32.900 --> 01:48:33.900
Dogs eat their own shit.

01:48:33.900 --> 01:48:34.900
Okay.

01:48:34.900 --> 01:48:37.200
Well, which is why he was chewing on one, two switch.

01:48:37.200 --> 01:48:39.620
So it is kind of the equivalent of eating shit.

01:48:39.620 --> 01:48:40.620
So that makes sense.

01:48:40.620 --> 01:48:44.000
Uh, it's two one hundred Matt and Chad says, put it up on a shelf that is away from San

01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:45.000
Rio.

01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:46.000
A, San Rio 17.

01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:47.880
She doesn't do that shit anymore.

01:48:47.880 --> 01:48:50.120
But B, we did, I did put it up on a shelf.

01:48:50.560 --> 01:48:54.380
In our studio here, we have an elevated television that we use for the PlayStation three because

01:48:54.380 --> 01:48:58.080
we actually use tune in to listen to Bobby Black Wolf here in studio before the show

01:48:58.080 --> 01:48:59.080
goes live.

01:48:59.080 --> 01:49:03.080
It almost makes me think if you painted that green, it would sort of look like a cactuar.

01:49:03.080 --> 01:49:04.080
It does.

01:49:04.080 --> 01:49:05.080
Like with the little arms sticking out.

01:49:05.080 --> 01:49:06.920
It would look like a cactuar if you painted it green.

01:49:06.920 --> 01:49:12.800
I'm going to put it up on, um, on my, uh, Facebook fan page.

01:49:12.800 --> 01:49:13.800
Jamie Summers on Facebook.

01:49:13.800 --> 01:49:14.920
You have a Facebook fan page?

01:49:14.920 --> 01:49:15.920
I do.

01:49:15.920 --> 01:49:16.920
All right.

01:49:16.920 --> 01:49:17.920
Why wouldn't I?

01:49:17.920 --> 01:49:18.920
You have fans?

01:49:18.920 --> 01:49:19.920
Yeah.

01:49:20.720 --> 01:49:21.720
Y'all need fan pages.

01:49:21.720 --> 01:49:23.720
You don't have fans without a fan page.

01:49:23.720 --> 01:49:24.720
I'm sorry.

01:49:24.720 --> 01:49:25.720
My ego's not that big.

01:49:25.720 --> 01:49:26.720
I have a Twitch.

01:49:26.720 --> 01:49:27.720
You can follow me.

01:49:27.720 --> 01:49:28.720
You can stroke my ego on Twitch.

01:49:28.720 --> 01:49:31.720
I did it because I was doing other shit too.

01:49:31.720 --> 01:49:32.720
That's fair.

01:49:32.720 --> 01:49:33.720
I'm just, I'm just giving you crap.

01:49:33.720 --> 01:49:35.520
Well, you always give me crap.

01:49:35.520 --> 01:49:36.520
Stop crapping.

01:49:36.520 --> 01:49:37.520
All right.

01:49:37.520 --> 01:49:38.520
There we go.

01:49:38.520 --> 01:49:39.520
You kind of need to crap.

01:49:39.520 --> 01:49:40.520
Nevermind.

01:49:40.520 --> 01:49:44.320
Ah, let's get into some rapid fire news and hopefully some non crappy things that happened

01:49:44.320 --> 01:49:45.520
in gaming this week.

01:49:45.520 --> 01:49:46.520
Loki.

01:49:46.520 --> 01:49:47.520
Yes.

01:49:48.120 --> 01:49:52.320
So one of the things during GDC that was talked about was Unreal Engine.

01:49:52.320 --> 01:49:57.320
And of course with that, um, they made some more updates about Fortnite.

01:49:57.320 --> 01:50:01.120
Hey, remember that game that was supposed to be coming out on Unreal Engine 4?

01:50:01.120 --> 01:50:02.120
No.

01:50:02.120 --> 01:50:06.920
It was supposed to be like a zombie survival game that was, you know, building your own

01:50:06.920 --> 01:50:08.820
base and stuff like that.

01:50:08.820 --> 01:50:10.120
So it's still coming.

01:50:10.120 --> 01:50:16.360
Um, it's supposed to be coming out this year on PC according to Tim Sweeney.

01:50:16.360 --> 01:50:17.360
All right then.

01:50:17.400 --> 01:50:19.200
So yeah, we'll look forward to it then.

01:50:19.200 --> 01:50:24.200
Um, something else that's going to be in development as well is Sleeping Dogs, the movie.

01:50:24.200 --> 01:50:29.600
So that's that Hong Kong action, open world action game that they had.

01:50:29.600 --> 01:50:36.360
Um, now it's supposed to, I guess, star, who do they have starring in there?

01:50:36.360 --> 01:50:42.200
Uh, it's being produced by Neil H. Morris, who did the Fast and the Furious, I am Legend

01:50:42.200 --> 01:50:44.320
21 Jump Street.

01:50:44.360 --> 01:50:48.640
And it's going to star Donnie Yen, who is, you know, definitely well known in the Hong

01:50:48.640 --> 01:50:51.760
Kong, um, you know, movie scene.

01:50:51.760 --> 01:51:00.160
It Man, Rogue One, um, and of course, uh, triple X Return of Xander Cage.

01:51:00.160 --> 01:51:01.160
I'm down.

01:51:01.160 --> 01:51:02.160
That'd be pretty awesome.

01:51:02.160 --> 01:51:05.280
That movie or the game was pretty cinematic as it was.

01:51:05.280 --> 01:51:11.960
So I don't need really an excuse to go see Hong Kong action movies.

01:51:11.960 --> 01:51:15.840
Not everyone is excited about it because, you know, in our chat over at live.vog network.com

01:51:15.840 --> 01:51:22.400
says Sleeping Dogs, the movie, no, I feel like I should shake the Vader thing.

01:51:22.400 --> 01:51:23.400
No.

01:51:23.400 --> 01:51:24.400
Shake.

01:51:24.400 --> 01:51:25.400
Shake.

01:51:25.400 --> 01:51:26.400
Shake.

01:51:26.400 --> 01:51:27.400
All right.

01:51:27.400 --> 01:51:28.400
Uh, let's see.

01:51:28.400 --> 01:51:29.400
Um, yeah.

01:51:29.400 --> 01:51:33.960
Uh, I don't know if, uh, it needs a movie, but okay.

01:51:33.960 --> 01:51:36.640
I mean, we could really use a good video game movie.

01:51:36.640 --> 01:51:38.240
That would be nice.

01:51:38.240 --> 01:51:41.000
At least we have some good sportsmanship in the video game world.

01:51:41.040 --> 01:51:45.840
Uh, the switch of course being released on Friday, believe it or not lent to some official

01:51:45.840 --> 01:51:51.280
comments from the PlayStation and the Xbox Twitter accounts that were very nice.

01:51:51.280 --> 01:51:54.760
Uh, the PlayStation account tweeting today's a big day for Nintendo.

01:51:54.760 --> 01:51:55.760
Congrats on launch.

01:51:55.760 --> 01:52:01.800
We can't wait to play with a little blue heart blue cause PlayStation, uh, whereas, uh, Microsoft

01:52:01.800 --> 01:52:05.900
wrote a little tweet on their Xbox account that said at Nintendo, it's not every day

01:52:05.900 --> 01:52:09.360
you get to throw the switch on a new console.

01:52:09.400 --> 01:52:10.400
So, uh, congrats.

01:52:10.400 --> 01:52:12.080
Hashtag Nintendo switch at Nintendo.

01:52:12.080 --> 01:52:14.960
They did a little animation that did like achievement unlocked.

01:52:14.960 --> 01:52:18.780
So even though they were gradually Nintendo, they had a very Microsoft thing and she'd

01:52:18.780 --> 01:52:19.920
been unlocked.

01:52:19.920 --> 01:52:28.240
We have achievements and you don't, that should, now that would have been the classless thing

01:52:28.240 --> 01:52:29.240
to do.

01:52:29.240 --> 01:52:33.200
Uh, Microsoft does what intend don't type of thing to respond, but isn't it nice though

01:52:33.200 --> 01:52:35.600
to see these, this has come a long way.

01:52:35.600 --> 01:52:37.260
What did Denny's and Arby's say?

01:52:37.260 --> 01:52:40.160
That's really what we want to know.

01:52:40.160 --> 01:52:41.160
That's a really good point.

01:52:41.160 --> 01:52:42.880
I think Denny's tweeted one of those pictures.

01:52:42.880 --> 01:52:45.480
It's like, look left, look right.

01:52:45.480 --> 01:52:46.720
You're having an existential crisis.

01:52:46.720 --> 01:52:47.720
There's, I don't know.

01:52:47.720 --> 01:52:48.720
It was really funny.

01:52:48.720 --> 01:52:51.640
I think I retweeted it, but yes, we need to know what did the Arby's account have to say?

01:52:51.640 --> 01:52:52.640
That's the most important.

01:52:52.640 --> 01:52:54.240
Or was it the Sonic account?

01:52:54.240 --> 01:52:55.240
That's very...

01:52:55.240 --> 01:52:56.240
Sonic the Hedgehog.

01:52:56.240 --> 01:52:58.400
Oh, I'm pretty sure they had tweeted something too.

01:52:58.400 --> 01:52:59.400
It's important.

01:52:59.400 --> 01:53:03.400
Uh, anyway, so, uh, also, which I thought was neat, uh, somebody else had tweeted, uh,

01:53:03.400 --> 01:53:08.240
like a reply that said, love when companies congratulate each other, makes it seem like

01:53:08.240 --> 01:53:12.640
we are all united and Xbox replied, it's all for the love of the games with the thumbs

01:53:12.640 --> 01:53:13.640
up emoji.

01:53:13.640 --> 01:53:15.800
So that was nice.

01:53:15.800 --> 01:53:20.200
But also I think the fact that it's Nintendo and you know, obviously Nintendo marches to

01:53:20.200 --> 01:53:21.800
the beat of their own drum.

01:53:21.800 --> 01:53:26.560
And so I think the competition is especially a little lesson there and come on guys.

01:53:26.560 --> 01:53:33.500
I'm sure the people that work at Sony and Microsoft probably play Nintendo.

01:53:33.500 --> 01:53:34.500
You know what?

01:53:34.500 --> 01:53:38.520
I bet the guys at Sony play Xbox and the guys at Microsoft play PlayStation.

01:53:38.520 --> 01:53:42.880
These two companies, they're not worried about Nintendo because they know the last couple

01:53:42.880 --> 01:53:45.720
of generations, it hasn't really eaten into their profits too much.

01:53:45.720 --> 01:53:53.000
They're probably just like, good job, good job, you know, putting out a console, you

01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:54.000
know.

01:53:54.000 --> 01:53:58.080
But look, the reality is too, that the games industry is like a small place too.

01:53:58.080 --> 01:54:02.160
So like, it's like, okay, look, Sony is not going to write a tweet that says, get fucked

01:54:02.160 --> 01:54:03.160
Nintendo.

01:54:03.160 --> 01:54:09.640
They're not going to write that tweet because then when like, you know, the, the social

01:54:09.640 --> 01:54:13.920
media person at one of these companies wants to go get a job somewhere else, they're going

01:54:13.920 --> 01:54:18.020
to be like, what was up with that tweet you sent to Nintendo that told me to become president

01:54:18.020 --> 01:54:21.440
someday, right?

01:54:21.440 --> 01:54:25.360
That's that's the only time you're going to be able to get away with, you know, as much

01:54:25.360 --> 01:54:30.400
as Trump tweets, he is really missing some, get fucked in there.

01:54:30.400 --> 01:54:36.780
I mean, cause that would just be like, hilarious, hilarious in the fact that like, Oh, Hey,

01:54:36.780 --> 01:54:42.580
there's blue flames coming off of the fire now, uh, dungeon buster and chat over at life.com

01:54:42.580 --> 01:54:46.760
says, if I recall correctly, major Nelson tweeted a picture of breath of the wild saying

01:54:46.760 --> 01:54:50.880
it was for research in quotes, see, it's cute.

01:54:50.880 --> 01:54:57.360
Come on, come on, look, there's a lot of gamers out there like me who are sick and own everything

01:54:57.360 --> 01:54:58.360
anyway.

01:54:58.360 --> 01:54:59.920
So you know what?

01:54:59.920 --> 01:55:00.920
It's a win.

01:55:00.920 --> 01:55:05.600
All right, let's move on to a Marvel and, uh, their, their gaming universe, which of

01:55:05.600 --> 01:55:09.840
course, Marvel versus Capcom infinite is going to be a big release in that universe.

01:55:09.840 --> 01:55:14.240
There's also though, don't forget the whole square Enix, uh, the, uh, crystal dynamics

01:55:14.240 --> 01:55:19.400
square, um, uh, Marvel project that's going on too, which I'm down for because it's Marvel

01:55:19.400 --> 01:55:20.400
cinematic universe.

01:55:20.400 --> 01:55:24.920
And I like the Marvel said, well, actually, apparently Marvel versus Capcom infinite.

01:55:24.920 --> 01:55:29.480
Um, they have the freedom to tell their story and they want to make an original story.

01:55:29.480 --> 01:55:33.440
It is not going to be a part of the cinematic universe.

01:55:33.440 --> 01:55:38.520
Uh, so, uh, Marvel games goal is to not force a games development timeline to match up with

01:55:38.520 --> 01:55:42.360
any upcoming movie, TV show or comic book.

01:55:42.360 --> 01:55:47.020
So these games are not directly tied to the universes in any way.

01:55:47.020 --> 01:55:49.420
They get to do their own thing.

01:55:49.420 --> 01:55:50.420
That makes sense.

01:55:50.420 --> 01:55:53.420
And with that said, I love the Deadpool two teaser.

01:55:53.420 --> 01:55:54.420
That was, I haven't seen it.

01:55:54.420 --> 01:55:57.940
I haven't even seen the Deadpool movie, but to be fair, I haven't seen like any movies.

01:55:57.940 --> 01:55:58.940
I know.

01:55:58.940 --> 01:56:00.660
Watch the Deadpool movie.

01:56:00.660 --> 01:56:01.660
Seriously.

01:56:01.660 --> 01:56:02.660
Go on.

01:56:02.660 --> 01:56:03.660
Last movie I saw in theaters was Warcraft.

01:56:03.660 --> 01:56:05.060
That was almost a year ago.

01:56:05.060 --> 01:56:06.420
Oh God, no.

01:56:06.420 --> 01:56:08.100
So I was bored enough on Saturday.

01:56:08.100 --> 01:56:11.580
I mean, obviously I was playing a lot of Zelda, but you have to come up for air once in a

01:56:11.580 --> 01:56:12.580
while.

01:56:12.580 --> 01:56:13.580
Right?

01:56:13.580 --> 01:56:14.580
So I actually started looking, I was looking at this brand new theater.

01:56:14.580 --> 01:56:18.140
They just opened up with the whole now recliner seats is the big deal, right?

01:56:18.140 --> 01:56:21.700
And they sell booze at theaters and this is an assigned seating thing, right?

01:56:21.700 --> 01:56:25.540
So I went onto the website and I was like, well, I want to see this get out because everybody's

01:56:25.540 --> 01:56:28.340
telling me it's fucking great and it looks good, so I'll go see it.

01:56:28.340 --> 01:56:32.180
So I was just, just for fun, I was going to pitch to Alan, like, let's go see, get out,

01:56:32.180 --> 01:56:33.460
I'll go get us tickets.

01:56:33.460 --> 01:56:39.220
But then as I'm looking online, like completely sold out for seven o'clock completely sold

01:56:39.220 --> 01:56:41.900
out except for like two seats in the front row for 10 o'clock.

01:56:41.900 --> 01:56:45.980
And it's like, now that you can buy your seats online, all this stuff like these things,

01:56:45.980 --> 01:56:49.420
these movies are sold out forever in advance.

01:56:49.420 --> 01:56:52.580
Like you can't just walk up to the theater anymore and go, yeah, I just want to see whatever

01:56:52.580 --> 01:56:53.580
movies coming up next.

01:56:53.580 --> 01:56:54.580
You can't really do that now.

01:56:54.580 --> 01:56:58.700
And I think the fact that all these theaters have giant recliners means there's less seats

01:56:58.700 --> 01:56:59.700
in the theater.

01:56:59.700 --> 01:57:02.780
Um, yeah, they're pretty large.

01:57:02.780 --> 01:57:06.940
So anyway, so no, I did not see, I haven't seen Logan.

01:57:06.940 --> 01:57:11.220
I haven't seen Deadpool, but, but don't take it personally, movie fans.

01:57:11.220 --> 01:57:16.380
I just haven't seen any movies because Alan and I also work the different schedules.

01:57:16.380 --> 01:57:18.820
So it's hard for us to go see movies together.

01:57:18.820 --> 01:57:22.300
You know, it's like when we have the time together, we have to do the really exciting

01:57:22.300 --> 01:57:29.140
things that married folks do and go grocery shopping and go pay bills.

01:57:29.140 --> 01:57:30.820
We don't have time for movies.

01:57:30.820 --> 01:57:31.820
Anyway.

01:57:31.820 --> 01:57:35.060
All right, uh, let's move on.

01:57:35.060 --> 01:57:36.060
More rapid fire news.

01:57:36.060 --> 01:57:37.060
Dark Sakura.

01:57:37.900 --> 01:57:43.220
Ah, if I don't unplug my phone, my, uh, mic here.

01:57:43.220 --> 01:57:44.220
Geez.

01:57:44.220 --> 01:57:47.780
So how about some PlayStation Plus?

01:57:47.780 --> 01:57:50.100
How's that sound?

01:57:50.100 --> 01:57:51.100
Yeah.

01:57:51.100 --> 01:57:57.700
Um, there are going to be free offerings, including a disc jam and tear away unfolded.

01:57:57.700 --> 01:58:08.540
Um, also included is earth defense force 2025 under night in birth exe, I guess late, whatever

01:58:08.540 --> 01:58:14.820
the fuck that is severed for Vita and Lumo for Vita, um, with cross by on PS4.

01:58:14.820 --> 01:58:20.220
Um, this goes live on the seventh, which is to use a day.

01:58:20.740 --> 01:58:28.420
Um, and also Disney stop, stop.

01:58:28.420 --> 01:58:33.500
Disney wants to reboot Tron with Jared Leto.

01:58:33.500 --> 01:58:34.500
Yeah.

01:58:34.500 --> 01:58:39.660
Cause that worked out so well when they put Jared Leto as the joker in suicide squad.

01:58:39.660 --> 01:58:41.100
She wasn't bad as the joker.

01:58:41.100 --> 01:58:45.100
Like Jared Leto is just kinda everywhere.

01:58:45.100 --> 01:58:47.140
I don't, I don't get it.

01:58:47.140 --> 01:58:48.140
It's like one of those things.

01:58:48.140 --> 01:58:53.980
And again, I didn't see suicide squad refer to our earlier conversation now.

01:58:53.980 --> 01:59:01.860
So riddle me this, if Tron legacy, if Tron legacy was so bad that they can't warrant

01:59:01.860 --> 01:59:05.360
a sequel, then why are they rebooting it?

01:59:05.360 --> 01:59:10.500
Why warrant another movie then if it was the whole thing, make the fucking third Tron movie,

01:59:10.500 --> 01:59:12.220
just make that movie.

01:59:12.220 --> 01:59:16.260
Everything I've heard is that star Wars killed Tron.

01:59:16.260 --> 01:59:19.980
When Disney got star Wars, they didn't need Tron anymore, so they threw it away.

01:59:19.980 --> 01:59:24.500
But now it seems like somebody's thinking maybe that wasn't such a good idea that maybe

01:59:24.500 --> 01:59:31.180
gasp both these movies could exist in the same place where Marvel's spitting out two

01:59:31.180 --> 01:59:32.900
or three movies a year.

01:59:32.900 --> 01:59:37.660
Surely Disney can put out two science fiction movies that may I point out are really fucking

01:59:37.660 --> 01:59:38.660
different.

01:59:38.660 --> 01:59:40.620
Are Tron and star Wars that similar?

01:59:40.620 --> 01:59:41.620
I don't fucking think so.

01:59:41.620 --> 01:59:46.740
They left it open to like at the end of legacy for like a really interesting like story.

01:59:46.740 --> 01:59:48.100
Let's just throw that out.

01:59:48.100 --> 01:59:51.740
I had heard this thing that Jared Leto was maybe supposed to be like another character

01:59:51.740 --> 01:59:52.740
in the third.

01:59:52.740 --> 01:59:53.740
I'm totally cool.

01:59:53.740 --> 01:59:54.740
Fine.

01:59:54.740 --> 01:59:55.740
Cool.

01:59:55.740 --> 01:59:59.580
Although I thought they had totally set it up for Cillian Murphy.

01:59:59.580 --> 02:00:00.580
Killian Murphy.

02:00:00.580 --> 02:00:01.580
I forget how to pronounce his name.

02:00:01.580 --> 02:00:05.420
They totally said that guy that played the scarecrow, who was awesome in that original,

02:00:05.420 --> 02:00:07.420
in that first Batman.

02:00:07.420 --> 02:00:10.500
But he was supposed to be the new villain, right?

02:00:10.500 --> 02:00:13.260
He'd set up as the guy from the first movie's kid.

02:00:13.260 --> 02:00:16.260
So he would be the villain in the third movie.

02:00:16.260 --> 02:00:19.500
So I mean, like there, the plot was fucking there.

02:00:19.500 --> 02:00:20.940
Make that movie.

02:00:20.940 --> 02:00:23.940
Why do you need to reboot Tron?

02:00:23.940 --> 02:00:26.340
I don't doesn't make sense.

02:00:26.340 --> 02:00:28.580
It doesn't seem like that would, I mean, I don't know.

02:00:28.580 --> 02:00:37.660
It just just, I, I'm happy if Tron can at least continue somehow, like I'll take a reboot

02:00:37.660 --> 02:00:41.460
over nothing, but I'm not hyped about it.

02:00:41.460 --> 02:00:46.860
Like, if they're worried that too much time has passed since Tron Legacy, they waited

02:00:46.860 --> 02:00:50.020
like 25 years to make Tron Legacy.

02:00:50.020 --> 02:00:54.140
So, so fucking what if like seven years have gone by since Tron Legacy?

02:00:54.140 --> 02:00:55.380
Make a third Tron movie.

02:00:55.380 --> 02:00:56.680
It will be fine.

02:00:56.680 --> 02:00:57.680
And you know what?

02:00:57.680 --> 02:00:58.780
Put a ride at Disney.

02:00:58.780 --> 02:01:03.280
Take the ride from, so I don't have to go to China, take the ride at Shanghai Disney

02:01:03.280 --> 02:01:08.600
and put it at California adventure or something because I want to go on that ride.

02:01:08.600 --> 02:01:13.240
Anyway, Tiger Claw in chat says, maybe that's what the movie is going to be called Tron

02:01:13.240 --> 02:01:15.560
rebooted or Tron reboot.

02:01:15.560 --> 02:01:16.560
Oh, get, get it?

02:01:16.560 --> 02:01:20.280
Cause it's play on computer stuff.

02:01:20.280 --> 02:01:21.360
That's where the confusion was.

02:01:21.360 --> 02:01:26.880
Maybe the third movie is just going to be Tron reboot and Oh, what a mind fuck that

02:01:26.880 --> 02:01:27.880
is.

02:01:27.880 --> 02:01:30.520
If that's the case, maybe that's just the third movie is Tron reboot.

02:01:30.520 --> 02:01:32.720
All right, moving on.

02:01:32.720 --> 02:01:35.520
Let's travel around and look at what's in stores this week.

02:01:35.520 --> 02:01:36.520
Loki.

02:01:36.520 --> 02:01:40.840
Although I wouldn't be too, um, too optimistic about it.

02:01:40.840 --> 02:01:42.800
So this week, uh, not a whole lot.

02:01:42.800 --> 02:01:50.360
Uh, we've got Altair, uh, Furis, the alchemists of, and the mystery, mysterious journey.

02:01:50.360 --> 02:01:53.000
It's on PC, PlayStation four and the Vita.

02:01:53.000 --> 02:02:00.280
Lego worlds out on PC, PlayStation four and Xbox one near automata on PlayStation four

02:02:00.280 --> 02:02:05.880
and Tom Clancy's ghost recon wild lands on PC, PlayStation four and Xbox one.

02:02:05.880 --> 02:02:06.880
That's it.

02:02:06.880 --> 02:02:08.120
All right.

02:02:08.120 --> 02:02:11.040
Let's travel over to Japan and look at what's coming out in Japan.

02:02:11.040 --> 02:02:16.120
Um, this week starting on the, I think the ninth is when all the games hit.

02:02:16.120 --> 02:02:17.120
Yep.

02:02:17.120 --> 02:02:20.220
Kingdom hearts, HD 1.5 and 2.5 remix.

02:02:20.220 --> 02:02:21.220
That's a pretty big deal.

02:02:21.220 --> 02:02:22.880
That's hitting the PlayStation four in Japan this week.

02:02:22.880 --> 02:02:25.200
I'm looking forward to the U S release of that for sure.

02:02:25.200 --> 02:02:26.800
Uh, let's see.

02:02:26.840 --> 02:02:31.040
Croylier Sigma comes out in Japan this week on PlayStation four, let it die.

02:02:31.040 --> 02:02:33.440
Gets an uncle prime edition in Japan this week.

02:02:33.440 --> 02:02:35.800
I'm assuming because that's a free to play game.

02:02:35.800 --> 02:02:39.240
There's some type of box diversion that comes with game credit or something like that.

02:02:39.240 --> 02:02:43.200
There's a green camouflage colored controller coming out this week as well for the PlayStation

02:02:43.200 --> 02:02:47.720
four and ultimate Marvel versus Capcom three gets a Japanese release this week.

02:02:47.720 --> 02:02:48.760
I thought it was already out there.

02:02:48.760 --> 02:02:52.320
Maybe this is some type of box diversion over there as well.

02:02:52.320 --> 02:02:57.120
Um, moving on to the Nintendo 3DS, I think is pretty slow this week.

02:02:57.120 --> 02:03:00.880
Yeah, no, I mean, Nintendo has obviously been focusing on the switch, which I'm not sure

02:03:00.880 --> 02:03:03.360
we have anything to report on the switch this week.

02:03:03.360 --> 02:03:04.360
No, we don't.

02:03:04.360 --> 02:03:06.320
I'm not starting to see switch releases fill in for Japan yet.

02:03:06.320 --> 02:03:08.240
Uh, that's probably going to take a little bit.

02:03:08.240 --> 02:03:12.680
And as we know, the Indies online is kind of what's really going to try to carry a Nintendo

02:03:12.680 --> 02:03:14.520
through these first few months here.

02:03:14.520 --> 02:03:16.680
So that's it for Japanese releases.

02:03:16.680 --> 02:03:19.040
How about the United Kingdom?

02:03:19.040 --> 02:03:20.040
Nothing.

02:03:20.040 --> 02:03:21.040
Nothing.

02:03:21.040 --> 02:03:22.040
Nothing.

02:03:22.040 --> 02:03:25.680
I guess when a new console comes out, that kind of takes the attention for a while.

02:03:25.680 --> 02:03:27.600
Nothing else happens.

02:03:27.600 --> 02:03:29.040
Tumbleweed is rolling by.

02:03:29.040 --> 02:03:31.920
All right, let's go to the mailbag.

02:03:31.920 --> 02:03:37.440
Every week you guys email us at participate at orange lounge radio.com and dark soccer

02:03:37.440 --> 02:03:43.840
dives in the mailbag and finds an email that she thinks, Hey, I'm going to read this on

02:03:43.840 --> 02:03:44.840
air.

02:03:44.840 --> 02:03:45.840
Dark soccer.

02:03:45.840 --> 02:03:46.840
Do we have email this week?

02:03:46.840 --> 02:03:47.840
I think we have one, right?

02:03:47.840 --> 02:03:48.840
We will.

02:03:48.840 --> 02:03:49.840
Yeah.

02:03:49.840 --> 02:03:50.840
One actually came at the end of last week.

02:03:50.840 --> 02:03:51.840
So I'm just going to read it.

02:03:51.840 --> 02:04:00.440
It's from Y Y R it's labeled floater and the body is, this is a crusty poop heart Aaron.

02:04:00.440 --> 02:04:01.640
That's disgusting.

02:04:01.640 --> 02:04:05.160
But I think that's because you said something about throwing poop emails in the mailbag

02:04:05.160 --> 02:04:06.160
or something.

02:04:06.160 --> 02:04:07.160
Maybe I said it.

02:04:07.160 --> 02:04:08.160
I don't know.

02:04:08.160 --> 02:04:09.160
Thanks.

02:04:09.160 --> 02:04:10.160
Gross.

02:04:10.160 --> 02:04:11.160
We got another one from Fabrice from Belgium.

02:04:11.160 --> 02:04:12.160
Just real quick.

02:04:12.160 --> 02:04:13.160
I'm just want to throw this out there.

02:04:13.160 --> 02:04:17.800
If you ever do end up coming up with a pixel shits too, I think the subtitle floater would

02:04:17.800 --> 02:04:18.800
be appropriate.

02:04:18.800 --> 02:04:24.320
It should be pixel shits too, should be turds in a river.

02:04:24.320 --> 02:04:26.440
Next thing you have to sink the floaters.

02:04:26.440 --> 02:04:30.240
All right, that's telling him how to live his life.

02:04:30.240 --> 02:04:31.240
Hello.

02:04:31.240 --> 02:04:37.680
O L R. I wonder what is your go to your to go game when you want to relax a game with

02:04:37.680 --> 02:04:43.080
no stress, something easy going yours truly Fabrice from Belgium.

02:04:43.080 --> 02:04:45.600
Skyrim H D remastered.

02:04:45.600 --> 02:04:46.600
Yeah.

02:04:46.600 --> 02:04:49.480
The Skyrim remastered is your go to answer for everything.

02:04:49.480 --> 02:04:51.140
It's pretty well, it's just relaxing.

02:04:51.140 --> 02:04:57.160
It's what I do the relax cause it's not really that hard.

02:04:57.160 --> 02:05:00.900
For me, it could be the MMO, Final Fantasy 14, although that's not always a relaxing

02:05:00.900 --> 02:05:04.880
thing if I'm trying to do like, you know, content that's, you know, newest and greatest

02:05:04.880 --> 02:05:05.880
it's like farming.

02:05:05.880 --> 02:05:06.880
And wow.

02:05:06.880 --> 02:05:07.880
Yeah.

02:05:07.880 --> 02:05:09.920
Well there's some of the like Zen things you can do.

02:05:09.920 --> 02:05:13.360
You know what's always been a very Zen game to me, like just kind of get in the mood and

02:05:13.360 --> 02:05:18.620
just, you know, do whatever Minecraft is a game like that for me actually digging holes

02:05:18.620 --> 02:05:19.620
with that music.

02:05:19.620 --> 02:05:20.620
Exactly.

02:05:20.620 --> 02:05:21.620
Yeah.

02:05:21.620 --> 02:05:23.520
I actually think I find Minecraft to be a very relaxing game.

02:05:23.520 --> 02:05:30.200
Now granted, I don't play on super hard difficulty, but I don't play on, um, what is it peaceful

02:05:30.200 --> 02:05:31.840
mode or whatever they call the creative.

02:05:31.840 --> 02:05:32.840
Yeah.

02:05:32.840 --> 02:05:33.840
Creative.

02:05:33.840 --> 02:05:34.840
I don't really play in that mode either.

02:05:34.840 --> 02:05:38.000
I do play in the survival, but I play on like the lowest difficulty setting.

02:05:38.080 --> 02:05:42.160
So it's like, there's a creeper once in a while who's going to piss me off, but it's,

02:05:42.160 --> 02:05:43.480
it's manageable.

02:05:43.480 --> 02:05:45.280
So I like Minecraft for game.

02:05:45.280 --> 02:05:49.560
Um, sometimes music games, I mean, it's been a long time since I really been able to just

02:05:49.560 --> 02:05:51.840
pop in, beat me into 2DX and do that.

02:05:51.840 --> 02:05:56.360
But even something like rez right now is kind of like that Zen thing for me.

02:05:56.360 --> 02:05:57.360
Animal crossing.

02:05:57.360 --> 02:05:58.360
Oh, is that your answer?

02:05:58.360 --> 02:05:59.360
Yeah.

02:05:59.360 --> 02:06:03.520
I mean, I kind of, I've kind of slacked off on it cause I need a new game to keep up with,

02:06:04.040 --> 02:06:07.360
but I've really enjoyed, you know, just about every animal crossing is something that's

02:06:07.360 --> 02:06:09.880
really relaxing and hanging out.

02:06:09.880 --> 02:06:11.680
It's just really easy.

02:06:11.680 --> 02:06:16.840
And then of course my reoccurring addiction to bust a move or puzzle bobble.

02:06:16.840 --> 02:06:21.440
You know what else for me is relaxing is watching other people play video games on Twitch, honestly,

02:06:21.440 --> 02:06:26.280
like sometimes I just want to lie on the couch and watch somebody else play a game.

02:06:26.280 --> 02:06:27.280
So I do that too.

02:06:27.280 --> 02:06:29.000
I have Dan for that.

02:06:29.000 --> 02:06:30.000
There you go.

02:06:30.000 --> 02:06:35.080
See, no, actually it's kind of stressful as I'm like, you just missed the thing.

02:06:35.080 --> 02:06:37.920
Go no, go, go backseat driver.

02:06:37.920 --> 02:06:42.320
If you don't fucking crouch and shoot that goat in the head, I'm leaving and he'll be

02:06:42.320 --> 02:06:47.080
like promise.

02:06:47.080 --> 02:06:48.600
This is what gaming is like in my house.

02:06:48.600 --> 02:06:49.600
Yeah, no, no.

02:06:49.600 --> 02:06:53.120
Um, see, Alan does most of his gaming on computer, so I can't exactly just be like, what'd you

02:06:53.120 --> 02:06:54.120
do?

02:06:54.120 --> 02:06:57.620
And I will do that once in a while, but I can't really like watch him play, uh, oblivion,

02:06:57.620 --> 02:07:01.300
which I know is what he's doing right now because he played the shit out of Skyrim.

02:07:01.300 --> 02:07:06.000
Then he played this shit out of Morrowind and obviously what was left is, well, he played

02:07:06.000 --> 02:07:07.000
five and three.

02:07:07.000 --> 02:07:08.080
When's he going to do four?

02:07:08.080 --> 02:07:11.300
So now he's making his way through oblivion right now with mods galore.

02:07:11.300 --> 02:07:16.080
So you know, though I do have an account for elder scrolls online and I probably should

02:07:16.080 --> 02:07:21.140
play it so that, you know, I didn't care for it, but I'm willing to give it another shot.

02:07:21.140 --> 02:07:22.900
It's been a while since I tried it last.

02:07:22.900 --> 02:07:25.300
I keep promising Tiara that I'll play more of it.

02:07:25.300 --> 02:07:26.300
Oh yeah, she's, she's super.

02:07:26.300 --> 02:07:29.100
Someone should be playing well with me.

02:07:29.100 --> 02:07:30.700
Somebody should give me money to do that.

02:07:30.700 --> 02:07:31.700
You know what?

02:07:31.700 --> 02:07:32.700
I'll do it.

02:07:32.700 --> 02:07:33.700
No, don't do it.

02:07:33.700 --> 02:07:34.700
Don't do that.

02:07:34.700 --> 02:07:35.700
I'm threatening it now.

02:07:35.700 --> 02:07:36.700
No, don't.

02:07:36.700 --> 02:07:37.700
That's mean.

02:07:37.700 --> 02:07:43.660
Besides, wait for the mass effect thing to wear off because I'm not going to get a month

02:07:43.660 --> 02:07:45.180
out of it with mass effect on the horizon.

02:07:45.180 --> 02:07:48.780
Wait for that to wear off and then, and then we'll think about that.

02:07:48.780 --> 02:07:49.780
All right.

02:07:49.780 --> 02:07:51.780
Is that it for the mailbag?

02:07:51.780 --> 02:07:52.780
Yeah.

02:07:52.780 --> 02:07:53.780
All right.

02:07:53.780 --> 02:07:56.620
Let's get to some other gaming news and then we're going to get to your calls.

02:07:56.620 --> 02:07:59.020
Orange Lounge Radio on Skype, but first Loki.

02:07:59.020 --> 02:08:02.940
See, this is the kind of thing that makes me wish I could go to GDC because of this

02:08:02.940 --> 02:08:04.060
kind of stuff.

02:08:04.060 --> 02:08:09.500
So Microsoft revealed, um, they're one of their first, remember they were, I think,

02:08:09.500 --> 02:08:14.900
was it said, um, God, I'm trying to remember when they announced the, like their headsets

02:08:14.900 --> 02:08:18.700
that they were coming, but I know it was relatively recent that they announced that they're going

02:08:18.700 --> 02:08:21.980
to be developing some actual VR headsets and stuff.

02:08:21.980 --> 02:08:27.060
Um, but anyways, one of the first ones that they were talking about, of course, um, Acer,

02:08:27.060 --> 02:08:32.780
ASUS and Dell were going to develop mixed reality headsets and they showed off the one

02:08:32.780 --> 02:08:33.780
from Acer.

02:08:33.780 --> 02:08:38.260
And so apparently if you went to this event, you also got one of the free dev kits, which

02:08:38.260 --> 02:08:43.780
I totally would want, um, but then what the Acer windows, uh, mixed reality development

02:08:43.780 --> 02:08:51.260
edition, it has two screens that are 1440 by 1440 and a native 90 Hertz refresh rate

02:08:51.260 --> 02:08:53.900
built in audio and a headphone Jack.

02:08:53.900 --> 02:09:00.860
Plus what's kind of cool is it, uh, doesn't require, um, any, uh, built in tracking.

02:09:00.860 --> 02:09:10.060
So it's going to basically allow developers not have to extern or, or rely on external,

02:09:10.060 --> 02:09:14.700
um, tracking, you know, like they have with like the vibe and stuff like that.

02:09:14.700 --> 02:09:19.500
So it's gonna, I guess it has some way to track built on in the actual headset.

02:09:19.660 --> 02:09:24.020
Um, the little video that they kind of showed demonstrating, it looks neat.

02:09:24.020 --> 02:09:28.020
It's more of like kind of what they were showing with the whole windows holographic, where,

02:09:28.020 --> 02:09:31.300
you know, more of like an office setting, you know, you can have it interact with the

02:09:31.300 --> 02:09:32.300
stuff that's in your room.

02:09:32.300 --> 02:09:39.020
I mean, they have like a picture in this of like Skype and some virtual dog thing.

02:09:39.020 --> 02:09:43.580
And you know, I don't know, outlook or something like that.

02:09:43.580 --> 02:09:48.540
Not too exciting, but I still think I'm pretty excited by like doing that virtual offices

02:09:48.540 --> 02:09:50.060
would be pretty sweet.

02:09:50.060 --> 02:09:54.780
Um, no word when they're actually going to be released, but it's neat to see that stuff

02:09:54.780 --> 02:10:01.220
is coming along and hopefully with that coming along, it won't require such a powerful PC

02:10:01.220 --> 02:10:02.220
to run.

02:10:02.220 --> 02:10:07.100
Uh, the other cool thing, Oculus announced that they're cutting the price of the Oculus

02:10:07.100 --> 02:10:10.420
Rift and touch bundles to $598.

02:10:10.420 --> 02:10:12.340
That is down $200.

02:10:12.340 --> 02:10:18.260
Plus not only that, you can get the controller set, um, for $99 instead of $199.

02:10:18.260 --> 02:10:19.260
Wow.

02:10:19.260 --> 02:10:20.260
They're still allowed to sell them.

02:10:20.260 --> 02:10:21.260
Good point.

02:10:21.260 --> 02:10:25.860
I actually thought about them like they're trying to get rid of those as quickly as possible.

02:10:25.860 --> 02:10:29.180
That was my first thought is like, wow, they're going to try to sandbag this shit before they

02:10:29.180 --> 02:10:30.740
can't sell them anymore.

02:10:30.740 --> 02:10:31.860
It's kind of interesting.

02:10:31.860 --> 02:10:35.740
Although obviously I would hope that doesn't happen, but you know, I mean that lawsuit

02:10:35.740 --> 02:10:38.200
was kind of interesting, fascinating.

02:10:38.200 --> 02:10:41.900
So they're saying though, um, you know, they're talking about also as I mentioned, you know,

02:10:41.900 --> 02:10:45.780
expensive PC, the village nowadays, so with the hardware it's coming out, it's getting

02:10:45.780 --> 02:10:46.780
cheaper and cheaper.

02:10:46.780 --> 02:10:48.540
They own a PC that can actually be VR ready.

02:10:48.540 --> 02:10:49.540
Yeah.

02:10:49.540 --> 02:10:52.700
So they're saying that when the Oculus first came out, you know, PC like that would cost

02:10:52.700 --> 02:10:57.160
about a thousand dollars nowadays though, it's about 700 and they said you can even

02:10:57.160 --> 02:11:00.620
get by with a PC that's built for like 400 at minimum specs.

02:11:00.620 --> 02:11:08.500
So that's not bad, not bad at all, but definitely need to do I get up off my ass and redo what

02:11:08.500 --> 02:11:14.380
I wanted to do here in the studio with a upgrade in OLR because I'm very curious with the new

02:11:14.380 --> 02:11:18.380
AMD Ryzen chips that they had come out to see those are supposed to perform pretty well.

02:11:18.380 --> 02:11:23.880
So I, and they're cheaper than the Microsoft chips or you know, the Intel chips.

02:11:23.880 --> 02:11:27.580
So I don't know, I'm a kind of an Intel fanboy.

02:11:27.580 --> 02:11:33.120
I've got AMD in my laptop and I don't really care for it too much, but the Ryzen chips

02:11:33.120 --> 02:11:34.120
sound good.

02:11:34.120 --> 02:11:39.800
I'm going to our chat over at live.vognetwork.com I'm still fascinated on this whole relaxing

02:11:39.800 --> 02:11:40.800
game talk.

02:11:40.800 --> 02:11:41.800
There's been a lot of talk in there.

02:11:41.800 --> 02:11:43.860
I've just catching up while he was reading that story.

02:11:43.860 --> 02:11:46.060
So back to back on the relaxing thing for a minute.

02:11:46.060 --> 02:11:49.660
Brad from Pod Culture suggesting No Man's Sky is a great Zen game.

02:11:49.660 --> 02:11:51.640
Yeah, that game had a lot in common with Minecraft.

02:11:51.640 --> 02:11:55.900
Like I understand that game is riddled with controversy, but you know, again, we've talked

02:11:55.900 --> 02:11:59.620
about this to death, but for what it is, there's a lot to enjoy about it.

02:11:59.620 --> 02:12:02.740
And yeah, there's definitely a lot of relaxing stuff in No Man's Sky.

02:12:02.740 --> 02:12:06.020
Kossen in chat says Stardew sounds like it could be my Zen game.

02:12:06.020 --> 02:12:07.020
Oh yeah.

02:12:07.020 --> 02:12:09.260
A lot of people are into Stardew Valley for that for sure.

02:12:09.260 --> 02:12:11.800
Dungeon Buster agreeing Stardew is pretty Zen.

02:12:11.800 --> 02:12:14.080
You don't need to rush into stuff and you can just grow things.

02:12:14.080 --> 02:12:15.920
Do they have that out on the Switch already?

02:12:15.920 --> 02:12:16.920
I know that was...

02:12:16.920 --> 02:12:17.920
It's coming.

02:12:17.920 --> 02:12:18.920
It's not out yet.

02:12:18.920 --> 02:12:19.920
It wasn't a launch title.

02:12:19.920 --> 02:12:20.920
Pardon me.

02:12:20.920 --> 02:12:21.920
It wasn't a launch title.

02:12:21.920 --> 02:12:26.360
They were saying that it is going to be the first place you can do multiplayer.

02:12:26.360 --> 02:12:28.180
Stardew Valley will be on the Switch.

02:12:28.180 --> 02:12:30.520
So that's what Nintendo is getting.

02:12:30.520 --> 02:12:31.520
That's a little special.

02:12:31.520 --> 02:12:37.360
Sg100mata is pointing out, I remember at Magfest where they did yoga for gamers, they played

02:12:37.360 --> 02:12:39.520
Minecraft music during it.

02:12:39.520 --> 02:12:45.040
JD saying Mini Metro is a good Zen game.

02:12:45.040 --> 02:12:48.000
William Murderface says Terraria is my chill game.

02:12:48.000 --> 02:12:49.000
Gotta mind them 2D pixels.

02:12:49.000 --> 02:12:51.760
Yeah, kind of like a 2D version of Minecraft.

02:12:51.760 --> 02:12:54.880
My relaxing game of course is Until Dawn Rush of Blood.

02:12:54.880 --> 02:12:56.600
It's not relaxing at all.

02:12:56.600 --> 02:12:59.120
It can't be if you played it enough.

02:12:59.120 --> 02:13:04.120
That's like saying I'm going to go play Resident Evil 7 just to chill out and relax a little

02:13:04.120 --> 02:13:05.120
bit.

02:13:05.120 --> 02:13:06.120
That's a nice easy evening.

02:13:06.120 --> 02:13:07.120
Stress free.

02:13:07.720 --> 02:13:13.440
I'm going to play Slenderman just to, you know, chill out.

02:13:13.440 --> 02:13:14.440
I have the hiccups.

02:13:14.440 --> 02:13:15.440
This is the worst.

02:13:15.440 --> 02:13:16.440
All right.

02:13:16.440 --> 02:13:18.080
Let me try to get through this story.

02:13:18.080 --> 02:13:22.120
One of the games that is on the Switch for launch is Shovel Knight.

02:13:22.120 --> 02:13:27.880
I haven't picked this up yet because I already own Shovel Knight on I think PlayStation 4

02:13:27.880 --> 02:13:28.880
and Wii U.

02:13:28.880 --> 02:13:32.800
So I was kind of like, do I really want to buy this game again?

02:13:32.800 --> 02:13:36.000
But this Shovel Knight, they have Specter of Torment separately, right?

02:13:36.000 --> 02:13:37.720
The prequel or whatever it is.

02:13:37.720 --> 02:13:41.720
They have that separate, but this Shovel Knight actually has all the original DLC included

02:13:41.720 --> 02:13:44.780
with it, which is pretty cool.

02:13:44.780 --> 02:13:50.460
And also with Shovel Knight, they are actually allowing you to do gender swapping in this

02:13:50.460 --> 02:13:52.640
new version of Shovel Knight.

02:13:52.640 --> 02:13:54.960
Although they're calling it body swap.

02:13:54.960 --> 02:13:55.960
I should be clear there.

02:13:55.960 --> 02:14:03.240
It's called body swap, but you can actually change the look and the text of Shovel Knight,

02:14:03.240 --> 02:14:08.680
Shield Knight, Black Knight, Plague Knight, and Propeller Knight to be male or female.

02:14:08.680 --> 02:14:14.640
So you could be a male Shovel Knight trying to save a male Shield Knight, or you could

02:14:14.640 --> 02:14:19.120
be like a female Shovel Knight trying to save a male Shield Knight or whatever the hell

02:14:19.120 --> 02:14:21.080
it is that you want to do.

02:14:21.080 --> 02:14:23.640
You can change that in the characters.

02:14:23.640 --> 02:14:27.280
What's cool is there's been a whole little like, kind of like looking into how these

02:14:27.280 --> 02:14:31.820
characters were designed, then you actually get to see a little bit that goes into it

02:14:31.820 --> 02:14:36.620
where it's not just like the female versions have a bow in their hair.

02:14:36.620 --> 02:14:37.620
They're very different.

02:14:37.620 --> 02:14:38.660
And sometimes it's very subtle.

02:14:38.660 --> 02:14:42.660
Like when I look at the female Shovel Knight, I have a really hard time seeing the difference,

02:14:42.660 --> 02:14:45.820
but there is, there is a difference and they kind of, they point out some of the stuff

02:14:45.820 --> 02:14:46.820
there.

02:14:46.820 --> 02:14:51.140
So does female Shovel Knight have more boobs or I mean, yes, but it's not like over the

02:14:51.140 --> 02:14:52.140
top.

02:14:52.140 --> 02:14:57.340
I mean, yes, women have breasts, so there is a breast area, but it's not like dead or

02:14:57.340 --> 02:14:58.840
alive breasts.

02:14:58.840 --> 02:15:00.840
You know what I mean?

02:15:00.840 --> 02:15:01.840
Yes.

02:15:01.840 --> 02:15:02.840
I get it.

02:15:02.840 --> 02:15:07.960
It's what you would expect a normal woman to look like in a, but in a, in a Knight outfit.

02:15:07.960 --> 02:15:12.840
Nobody ever said dead or alive was set on earth, so.

02:15:12.840 --> 02:15:17.160
And sometimes the fun way to play it is with gravity from the moon, right?

02:15:17.160 --> 02:15:23.120
It's just gravity from the moon, only in the chest area that that's really everywhere else.

02:15:23.120 --> 02:15:25.920
You know, it's, it's its own thing.

02:15:26.000 --> 02:15:31.160
Uh, let's see, SSU 100 Matt says, it's funny that Shane all of a sudden is going crazy

02:15:31.160 --> 02:15:32.160
over Shovel Knight.

02:15:32.160 --> 02:15:35.680
Now he's not here to defend himself, although I've told him he can come on the show whenever

02:15:35.680 --> 02:15:37.800
he wants.

02:15:37.800 --> 02:15:42.720
But yes, I think it's funny too, cause I tried to like play that game before for him, but

02:15:42.720 --> 02:15:46.280
now that it's on the Switch, Shane is all about the Switch.

02:15:46.280 --> 02:15:49.800
I almost wish he was here tonight to kind of be a nice little counterbalance to maybe

02:15:49.800 --> 02:15:53.600
some of the negativity cause Shane is like nothing but positive on Switch right now.

02:15:53.600 --> 02:15:59.200
So maybe I'll get him here on a future week, but now that Shovel Knight's on the Switch,

02:15:59.200 --> 02:16:00.200
he's checking that out.

02:16:00.200 --> 02:16:02.200
So interesting.

02:16:02.200 --> 02:16:09.800
All right, moving on, let's get to another story from Dark Sakura.

02:16:09.800 --> 02:16:13.640
There is some smart garbage out there.

02:16:13.640 --> 02:16:19.640
It's actually a trash can that has a game built into it.

02:16:19.640 --> 02:16:27.800
So it's called the Tetra bin and it basically rewards you for throwing away garbage by having

02:16:27.800 --> 02:16:30.420
a little game built into it.

02:16:30.420 --> 02:16:36.120
I couldn't see too much about it, but like pretty much the way that it works, it looks

02:16:36.120 --> 02:16:38.820
almost like it's got a duck hunt screen on it.

02:16:38.820 --> 02:16:46.120
And when you drop your can in, there is a, like a, birds will like go and try to catch

02:16:46.120 --> 02:16:49.200
the garbage on the digitized screen.

02:16:49.200 --> 02:16:53.480
And they, and there's like dogs and bats and oh yeah, they're bats, not birds.

02:16:53.480 --> 02:16:55.360
They fly around going, feed me, feed me.

02:16:55.360 --> 02:17:00.960
And so when you feed them, you get a code that can be redeemed on the Tetra bin website

02:17:00.960 --> 02:17:07.120
so that, um, you can get like stuff in the mail, like freebies and samples and things

02:17:07.120 --> 02:17:08.120
like that.

02:17:08.120 --> 02:17:11.720
So the cycle never ends.

02:17:11.720 --> 02:17:16.580
But the whole thing is it's meant to encourage other people to get into the habit of picking

02:17:16.580 --> 02:17:19.420
up trash that you see around and throw away.

02:17:19.420 --> 02:17:22.860
So which everyone should fucking be doing, actually, everyone should just be throwing

02:17:22.860 --> 02:17:24.700
away their own garbage.

02:17:24.700 --> 02:17:25.700
Don't leave your shit.

02:17:25.700 --> 02:17:26.700
Throw it away.

02:17:26.700 --> 02:17:27.700
There's a trash can.

02:17:27.700 --> 02:17:29.780
And don't leave your dog shit either.

02:17:29.780 --> 02:17:31.480
Yes, that too.

02:17:31.480 --> 02:17:36.020
If you don't have a trash can handy, put it in a bag or something and then wait until

02:17:36.020 --> 02:17:37.020
you can throw it away.

02:17:37.020 --> 02:17:41.220
It's not that fucking hard, but anyway, it's, it's a good incentive and I think it's a cute

02:17:41.220 --> 02:17:42.220
idea.

02:17:42.220 --> 02:17:45.780
So, but the real question is, can you install Linux on it?

02:17:45.780 --> 02:17:46.780
Probably.

02:17:46.780 --> 02:17:47.780
I bet it's running on Linux.

02:17:47.780 --> 02:17:48.780
Yeah.

02:17:48.780 --> 02:17:49.780
I was gonna say it's probably running Linux.

02:17:49.780 --> 02:17:50.780
That's true.

02:17:50.780 --> 02:17:51.780
It probably is.

02:17:51.780 --> 02:17:52.780
That's it on that.

02:17:52.780 --> 02:17:53.780
All right.

02:17:53.780 --> 02:17:54.780
Just a couple more stories for you guys.

02:17:54.780 --> 02:17:58.020
And then the Skypline at Orange Lounge Radio.

02:17:58.020 --> 02:18:05.020
So Riot Games has won a lawsuit against a website called LeagueSharp and LeagueSharp

02:18:05.020 --> 02:18:12.640
was a website running, um, it allowed you to sign up for $15 to $50 a month for access

02:18:12.640 --> 02:18:17.760
to numerous bot scripts that would allow players to perform maneuvers that they would,

02:18:17.760 --> 02:18:22.080
you know, be very difficult for them to do otherwise in League of Legends.

02:18:22.080 --> 02:18:25.600
And so of course, you know, they went after them because that's, you know, a big no-no

02:18:25.600 --> 02:18:31.440
and, um, they won $10 million.

02:18:31.440 --> 02:18:34.560
$10 million?

02:18:34.560 --> 02:18:35.560
That's a lot of money.

02:18:35.560 --> 02:18:36.560
Yep.

02:18:36.560 --> 02:18:37.560
Wow.

02:18:37.560 --> 02:18:44.400
Being that they won the, uh, you know, websites no more.

02:18:44.400 --> 02:18:47.400
But that software is still out there for people to use, right?

02:18:47.400 --> 02:18:49.120
I'm just kidding.

02:18:49.120 --> 02:18:51.120
Once on the internet, always on the internet.

02:18:51.120 --> 02:18:53.080
All right.

02:18:53.080 --> 02:18:55.520
Um, so, uh, yeah.

02:18:55.520 --> 02:19:00.720
Don't, don't write cheat programs for games that rely on these things to make money, right?

02:19:00.720 --> 02:19:02.560
Or you might find yourself in court too.

02:19:02.560 --> 02:19:03.560
Don't cheat in online games.

02:19:03.560 --> 02:19:04.560
There you go.

02:19:04.560 --> 02:19:05.560
That's a very good way of putting it.

02:19:05.560 --> 02:19:06.560
Don't cheat in online games.

02:19:06.560 --> 02:19:07.560
That's very good.

02:19:07.560 --> 02:19:08.560
All right.

02:19:08.560 --> 02:19:09.840
I'm going to try to get through this.

02:19:09.840 --> 02:19:13.880
I have hiccups though, and this is the worst possible thing that could happen on the radio

02:19:13.880 --> 02:19:14.880
in my opinion.

02:19:14.880 --> 02:19:17.040
But, um, anyway, I'm trying, trying to get through this.

02:19:17.040 --> 02:19:22.040
Um, the, uh, this week launched the Video Game History Foundation.

02:19:22.040 --> 02:19:23.960
Um, this is pretty cool.

02:19:23.960 --> 02:19:28.880
Uh, being launched by a former games journalist and developer, uh, Frank Sifaldi, uh, who

02:19:28.880 --> 02:19:33.360
was involved with the, um, you know, what's funny is that was on a podcast he was on,

02:19:33.360 --> 02:19:34.880
but we were on at different times.

02:19:34.880 --> 02:19:38.520
And, uh, so we weren't like on there together, but like, I know they were promoting that

02:19:38.520 --> 02:19:41.760
he was coming up next after me, um, or the other way around.

02:19:41.760 --> 02:19:45.680
But anyway, he, he was involved with the, um, Mega Man collection.

02:19:45.680 --> 02:19:49.120
So I know he does a lot with the retro video games and, uh, I want to say, didn't he drop

02:19:49.120 --> 02:19:52.400
hints that there might be something else coming with that whole Mega Man thing?

02:19:52.400 --> 02:19:55.040
Well, uh, anyway, he does a lot with video game restoration.

02:19:55.040 --> 02:20:03.660
I think the, also the story that was going around about the joust game that Iwata had

02:20:03.660 --> 02:20:05.780
been involved with on the NES.

02:20:05.780 --> 02:20:06.780
We talked about a few months ago.

02:20:06.780 --> 02:20:09.340
I think he was involved with that as well.

02:20:09.340 --> 02:20:13.220
So it seems like when there is a digging up something in video games past thing going

02:20:13.220 --> 02:20:15.680
on, this guy does seem to be involved.

02:20:15.680 --> 02:20:20.700
So yeah, this is a guy that seems to be a good fit for this, working with this Video

02:20:20.700 --> 02:20:21.780
Game History Foundation.

02:20:21.780 --> 02:20:28.020
It's a nonprofit organization dedicated to preserving the past of video games, not just

02:20:28.020 --> 02:20:35.700
code, but the printed materials, advertisements, and other things that go into video games.

02:20:35.700 --> 02:20:38.260
So the first project launched this week.

02:20:38.260 --> 02:20:45.780
It's a digital archive of pamphlets and ads surrounding the NES's original launch in 1985.

02:20:45.780 --> 02:20:50.500
So they are on Patreon if you want to support them there, or you can check out their website,

02:20:50.500 --> 02:20:55.780
gamehistory.org, and you can actually do a tax deductible donation over there.

02:20:55.780 --> 02:21:00.940
You know, this is something they are saying is important because, especially when it comes

02:21:00.940 --> 02:21:04.740
to CD-ROMs, which was a huge era of gaming, right?

02:21:04.740 --> 02:21:08.780
Our classic game of the week, part of that CD-ROM era of gaming, right?

02:21:08.780 --> 02:21:10.900
CD-ROMs don't last forever.

02:21:10.900 --> 02:21:15.900
And some of the CD-ROMs out there are really starting to break down, so they want to preserve

02:21:15.900 --> 02:21:21.020
as much as possible of this so that future generations kind of know what the history

02:21:21.020 --> 02:21:22.920
of video gaming looked like.

02:21:22.920 --> 02:21:26.720
You know, unrelated to this, but maybe related a little bit, I was reading a story this week

02:21:26.720 --> 02:21:34.040
about, I guess, like the old CRT televisions that go in old video game cabinets.

02:21:34.040 --> 02:21:35.680
Like they don't make them anymore.

02:21:35.680 --> 02:21:40.360
Like as of this past couple weeks, they don't make CRT TVs anymore.

02:21:40.360 --> 02:21:41.360
They're done.

02:21:41.360 --> 02:21:47.800
So if you want to replace like a TV in a video game cabinet and you can't get one to recycle,

02:21:47.800 --> 02:21:51.960
you have to get like an LCD monitor, which isn't a pure way to do it.

02:21:51.960 --> 02:21:57.400
You know, it's going to be different on an LCD screen versus the old CRTs.

02:21:57.400 --> 02:22:01.600
So that is an era of gaming that's going away too.

02:22:01.600 --> 02:22:04.200
Wasn't the process of making those actually kind of dangerous, and that's part of the

02:22:04.200 --> 02:22:05.640
reason why they don't do it that way anymore?

02:22:05.640 --> 02:22:09.560
Like there's like gas inside the tubes that make it run and all that stuff, right?

02:22:09.560 --> 02:22:11.280
So I think that's a part of the reason why they don't do that.

02:22:11.280 --> 02:22:15.120
Well, they were in a vacuum and if, you know, they had like really high capacitors in them

02:22:15.120 --> 02:22:19.680
and stuff that you got to be careful to, you know, discharge that stuff before you start

02:22:19.680 --> 02:22:26.600
working on them as you don't electrocute yourself, I mean, yeah, it's less than ideal,

02:22:26.600 --> 02:22:31.160
but you know, it's still good, you know, good tech if you're into like, you know, fighting

02:22:31.160 --> 02:22:33.320
games and stuff like that.

02:22:33.320 --> 02:22:37.160
Dungeon Buster in chat says older magazines are also getting harder to come by, which

02:22:37.160 --> 02:22:42.360
is why it's nice that places such as archive.org have a lot of these scanned copies there.

02:22:42.360 --> 02:22:43.600
Yeah, that's very true.

02:22:43.600 --> 02:22:44.600
All right.

02:22:44.600 --> 02:22:47.640
Well, we're going to open up the Skype line right now.

02:22:47.640 --> 02:22:50.480
It's time for you to give us a call if you want to talk about anything we've talked about

02:22:50.480 --> 02:22:54.240
in this part of the show, or maybe the first part of the show, or whatever is on your mind

02:22:54.240 --> 02:22:55.240
tonight.

02:22:55.240 --> 02:22:59.320
Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype if you want to give us a call, and it's already

02:22:59.320 --> 02:23:00.760
lighting up over there.

02:23:00.760 --> 02:23:01.760
Let's get to it.

02:23:01.760 --> 02:23:02.760
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:23:02.760 --> 02:23:03.760
Who's this?

02:23:03.760 --> 02:23:04.760
Hey, this is Akdeft.

02:23:04.760 --> 02:23:05.760
Hey, Akdeft.

02:23:05.760 --> 02:23:07.760
How are you, my friend?

02:23:07.760 --> 02:23:10.760
I'm doing okay, mostly.

02:23:10.760 --> 02:23:15.480
Yeah, I know you were one of those people that got screwed by Amazon, huh?

02:23:15.520 --> 02:23:22.840
Yeah, one of the many, but I want to focus on something really great that we talked on

02:23:22.840 --> 02:23:24.600
Twitter the other day.

02:23:24.600 --> 02:23:26.040
Sure, go for it.

02:23:26.040 --> 02:23:34.720
Yeah, we were talking about, well, Breath of the Wild, that's an American dub.

02:23:34.720 --> 02:23:41.920
And while it's not something new that games have recently done, at least in the past few

02:23:41.920 --> 02:23:49.200
years it has grown, I'm still really happy to see that Nintendo has adopted this onto

02:23:49.200 --> 02:23:52.600
their games.

02:23:52.600 --> 02:23:59.080
And I was not hearing about only Breath of the Wild, also Want to Switch also has Latin

02:23:59.080 --> 02:24:00.600
American dubs.

02:24:00.600 --> 02:24:09.280
So it's really awesome to see that game companies, even right now Sony and Microsoft, back in

02:24:09.280 --> 02:24:15.240
the 360 days, it's something that they have done.

02:24:15.240 --> 02:24:25.880
And as a person that, well, speaks English and also Spanish in the native way, it's really

02:24:25.880 --> 02:24:35.680
good to see that they're adopting this to sell their games on other countries.

02:24:36.680 --> 02:24:45.000
Yeah, the back and forth that we were having on Twitter was that you had posted a clip

02:24:45.000 --> 02:24:50.920
of your Overwatch play of the game, and I noticed that it was using, obviously, the

02:24:50.920 --> 02:24:54.000
Latin American language.

02:24:54.000 --> 02:25:00.440
And I thought it was neat because it kind of emulates that robotic voice that goes,

02:25:00.440 --> 02:25:01.720
play of the game.

02:25:01.720 --> 02:25:04.320
It says it in Spanish instead.

02:25:04.360 --> 02:25:06.960
And then it kind of got me thinking about how, oh yeah, you have all these other voice

02:25:06.960 --> 02:25:11.160
actors who kind of emulate the whole like McCree going, it's high noon, you know, probably

02:25:11.160 --> 02:25:15.280
saying it in a very similar way, but in the Latin American dialogue, this is kind of interesting

02:25:15.280 --> 02:25:17.200
to me to listen to that sometimes.

02:25:17.200 --> 02:25:22.880
And I watched the Twitch screens, the streams on Twitch, where they have like Japanese voice

02:25:22.880 --> 02:25:26.120
acting and all that stuff as well, which I think is neat.

02:25:26.920 --> 02:25:36.600
Yeah, also Blizzard did the, well, sorry, did the Overwatch dub for Latin America, and

02:25:36.600 --> 02:25:42.880
many other countries, it has so many dubs in many languages that it's pretty amazing

02:25:42.880 --> 02:25:45.880
to see.

02:25:45.880 --> 02:25:52.400
And something curious, because at least in PC, you can have like the English text and

02:25:52.400 --> 02:26:02.480
have another language be the voice, like have it in Japanese or have it in Spanish.

02:26:02.480 --> 02:26:09.600
And again, it's really great to see something like this and, sorry, I'm going to repeat

02:26:09.600 --> 02:26:16.720
myself again, but it's really amazing to see because it's something that, even in the PlayStation

02:26:16.720 --> 02:26:24.800
2 era, like in that generation, we did see games in Spanish, but many developers were

02:26:24.800 --> 02:26:32.920
like really, really lazy and used Spaniard, the Spanish that is used in Spain, which it

02:26:32.920 --> 02:26:42.640
ain't that much different from Latin America, but it does sound different and we don't use

02:26:42.640 --> 02:26:48.680
in Latin America the same language they use in, or at least the same words.

02:26:48.680 --> 02:26:53.440
There's a whole like, there's a whole verb conjugation that you don't use in Latin America

02:26:53.440 --> 02:26:55.080
that they do in Spanish, right?

02:26:55.080 --> 02:26:56.080
Vosotros?

02:26:56.080 --> 02:26:58.680
That doesn't even exist really in Latin America, right?

02:26:58.680 --> 02:27:07.040
Yeah, in Spain, sorry, they use vosotros, which is basically like you and plural.

02:27:07.040 --> 02:27:14.560
What we use in Latin America, what is status, that is you plural for us, so yeah, it's not

02:27:14.560 --> 02:27:21.080
even the same and it's another verb conjugation and again, it is said that we don't understand

02:27:21.080 --> 02:27:28.960
it because it's like something that was teach even, not even like 30 years ago, so maybe

02:27:28.960 --> 02:27:34.660
some people do know about it, but still, it sounds weird, so well, again, it's something

02:27:34.660 --> 02:27:42.900
like really, really lazy because they didn't even give a chance for a Latin American dub

02:27:42.900 --> 02:27:47.380
or even a translation or adaptation to be done.

02:27:47.380 --> 02:27:53.100
JD's asking in chat, I'm curious about Latin American localizations, do they pick a country's

02:27:53.100 --> 02:28:00.580
dialect to standardize on since there's some variation between Caribbean, Central American,

02:28:00.580 --> 02:28:04.620
but wouldn't that be, I mean, technically you could say even within North America, the

02:28:04.620 --> 02:28:10.500
USA, somebody in California is going to sound somebody different from somebody in Alabama,

02:28:10.500 --> 02:28:11.500
right?

02:28:11.500 --> 02:28:16.700
Dark Sakura, sometimes her Alabama sidekicks in, right, versus in the Northeast where somebody

02:28:16.700 --> 02:28:21.920
might say Wicked Awesome, which is like not something you hear here ever, so, you know,

02:28:21.920 --> 02:28:23.980
like there's little things like that, right?

02:28:23.980 --> 02:28:30.240
I mean, yeah, yeah, but there's definitely things like that and sorry for the interruption,

02:28:30.240 --> 02:28:39.080
but yeah, we in Mexico, we have even like so many dialects, so many accents also, but

02:28:39.080 --> 02:28:45.680
speaking like of Latin America as a whole, pretty much each region, Mexico, Central America,

02:28:45.680 --> 02:28:52.120
South America have distinct accents, so it's not necessarily the same and not even the

02:28:52.120 --> 02:29:01.840
same use of words, but most, at least as of recent, most companies, speaking of movies,

02:29:01.840 --> 02:29:11.040
television, and all that, and now games, try to use like a neutral standard, neutral Spanish,

02:29:11.040 --> 02:29:20.760
so it doesn't use like words that we maybe use in Mexico that aren't used in other countries.

02:29:20.760 --> 02:29:25.560
Like hella, we say hella in Northern California, but nobody else says that, so we wouldn't

02:29:25.560 --> 02:29:28.160
put hella in a video game.

02:29:28.160 --> 02:29:36.000
Yeah, and that's like your character is from California and you're gonna try to emphasize

02:29:36.000 --> 02:29:43.000
that, but other than that, like for example, and I'm gonna put the example of McCree, since

02:29:43.240 --> 02:29:54.240
he's a cowboy, he does have like a typical Northern Mexican accent, somewhat, so at least

02:29:54.760 --> 02:30:01.760
he doesn't use that many words, like specialized words, or, I lost the word specifically for

02:30:05.360 --> 02:30:12.360
it, but, like idioms, or, sorry, but yeah, you get the idea.

02:30:14.000 --> 02:30:21.000
But yeah, there's the voice actor for Lucio in Latin America, he does like this fake Brazilian

02:30:24.560 --> 02:30:31.560
accent too, so yeah, it sounds funny also, and it's really great to see stuff like this

02:30:34.800 --> 02:30:41.800
and to talk about this, because it's something that I really appreciate as a translator myself.

02:30:42.200 --> 02:30:46.280
No, I think it's really fascinating, I think it's cool, I like to just listen to the games

02:30:46.280 --> 02:30:52.320
in the other languages and hear those small nuances and things like that, and yeah, I

02:30:52.320 --> 02:30:57.960
think it's great that it makes the game more accessible to other players, which I think

02:30:57.960 --> 02:30:59.320
is a great thing, of course.

02:30:59.320 --> 02:31:01.480
Oops, excuse me, still have those hiccups.

02:31:01.480 --> 02:31:07.260
But the problem is, or not the problem, but the interesting thing with Zelda is that there's

02:31:07.260 --> 02:31:12.340
not a lot of dialogue that they're going to have to localize either, well, the written

02:31:12.340 --> 02:31:17.900
dialogue, yes, but the voice acting isn't everywhere, I mean, it's still weird to hear

02:31:17.900 --> 02:31:24.560
voice acting in a Zelda game at all, but they still use the general, like, uh, uh, like,

02:31:24.560 --> 02:31:28.820
in some places, like those little noises, they use that a lot.

02:31:28.820 --> 02:31:33.040
But there is definitely some scenes that are voice acted, and yeah, it's kind of interesting

02:31:33.040 --> 02:31:37.220
to hear in the Zelda series, but now our friends in Latin America will get to hear it in the

02:31:37.220 --> 02:31:38.620
in their native language.

02:31:38.620 --> 02:31:47.700
Yeah, and hopefully Nintendo doesn't cut this trend, like, oh, it's only for this few games.

02:31:47.700 --> 02:31:54.220
I hope to see this become a trend, like, probably with Xenoblade, it would be, like, really

02:31:54.220 --> 02:32:01.120
awesome to see, with Xenoblade 2 coming this year, to see, like, a Latin American dub.

02:32:01.120 --> 02:32:07.440
So hopefully, but we'll see, at least, uh, we're taking, the game companies in general

02:32:07.440 --> 02:32:13.320
are taking steps toward, uh, localizing stuff, like, for region, not especially specifically

02:32:13.320 --> 02:32:16.800
for language, so that's really, really great.

02:32:16.800 --> 02:32:17.800
Baby steps.

02:32:17.800 --> 02:32:18.800
Yeah.

02:32:18.800 --> 02:32:19.800
Alright.

02:32:19.800 --> 02:32:23.520
Act F, I'm gonna let you go, but thanks so much for the phone call, my friend.

02:32:23.520 --> 02:32:24.960
Hey, thanks for having me.

02:32:24.960 --> 02:32:27.600
Thank you, bye-bye.

02:32:27.600 --> 02:32:31.680
Orange Lounge Radio on Skype, if you want to give us a call and, uh, talk to me while

02:32:31.680 --> 02:32:33.080
I have the hiccups here.

02:32:33.080 --> 02:32:35.440
Let me check in with Loki to see if there's any last minute stories.

02:32:35.440 --> 02:32:39.880
Sure, yeah, we can talk about a few things, so how about the games that are coming out

02:32:39.880 --> 02:32:41.440
for PlayStation Plus in March?

02:32:41.440 --> 02:32:42.800
So you're gonna get Tearaway-

02:32:42.800 --> 02:32:45.720
I think Dark Soccer covered those during Rapid Fire.

02:32:45.720 --> 02:32:47.800
My mistake, wasn't paying attention.

02:32:47.800 --> 02:32:55.440
Alright, and then how about, uh, we talk about, uh, the campaign here, so the GoFundMe campaign

02:32:55.440 --> 02:33:02.480
for a new Nick Arcade show, um, starring, uh, Phil Moore is gonna be launching, and

02:33:02.480 --> 02:33:08.600
that's for, uh, Battle Arcade, and it's supposed to be kind of the same type of premise, um,

02:33:08.600 --> 02:33:09.600
that's awesome.

02:33:09.600 --> 02:33:17.080
I'm down with that, especially with that reboot of, uh, Starrcade coming back as well, so.

02:33:17.080 --> 02:33:18.080
And-

02:33:18.080 --> 02:33:19.080
Everything old is new again.

02:33:19.080 --> 02:33:20.080
Yeah.

02:33:20.080 --> 02:33:24.200
And then the other thing, um, you know, just kind of a PSA, I guess, um, don't put adhesives

02:33:24.200 --> 02:33:29.160
on your Switch console, because I guess it takes off the paint, because of whatever paint

02:33:29.160 --> 02:33:34.280
or coating they put on it, it's not as durable as some of the other systems out there.

02:33:34.280 --> 02:33:37.360
Be careful with that stuff when it's not officially licensed, for sure.

02:33:37.360 --> 02:33:41.360
Well, even, yeah, I mean, dbrand is the one that kind of pointed that out, because they're

02:33:41.360 --> 02:33:46.920
developing skins for that console, and they're like, hey, you know, we've, you know, got

02:33:46.920 --> 02:33:51.260
the retail version, and we found that it's been pulling paint up, so we're canceling

02:33:51.260 --> 02:33:54.160
all your orders for that stuff, you know, just to let you know, don't do that.

02:33:55.120 --> 02:33:57.120
Which is kind of nice of them.

02:33:57.120 --> 02:33:58.640
Please do not do that.

02:33:58.640 --> 02:33:59.640
Alright.

02:33:59.640 --> 02:34:03.780
Well, um, our phone's not really ringing, so I think I'm going to go ahead and shut

02:34:03.780 --> 02:34:05.320
it down and wrap up the show tonight.

02:34:05.320 --> 02:34:08.120
My hiccups are going crazy, so I think it's time to, uh-

02:34:08.120 --> 02:34:09.240
We didn't do a fuse.

02:34:09.240 --> 02:34:10.800
I think it's time to shut that down.

02:34:10.800 --> 02:34:12.360
You need to do some FUs tonight, Darzagra?

02:34:12.360 --> 02:34:13.360
Yeah.

02:34:13.360 --> 02:34:14.880
Alright, let's get to it then, before we say goodnight.

02:34:14.880 --> 02:34:16.360
The FUs of the week!

02:34:16.360 --> 02:34:38.760
FU to Sinus Infections, and FU to dealing with Kaiser over all of this shit.

02:34:38.760 --> 02:34:40.480
I'm ready to be done.

02:34:40.480 --> 02:34:41.680
Fuck it.

02:34:41.680 --> 02:34:45.560
Also, FU to not being able to finish an entire cool damn fight.

02:34:45.560 --> 02:34:50.000
FU to the hiccups.

02:34:50.000 --> 02:34:53.760
What did I do to deserve this, other than maybe drinking water a little fast?

02:34:53.760 --> 02:34:56.520
Because I was trying to get to the next story.

02:34:56.520 --> 02:35:00.360
Man, Loki, do you have anything to get off your chest tonight?

02:35:00.360 --> 02:35:05.280
I just wish I hadn't eaten 11 breadsticks, other than that, I'm fine.

02:35:05.280 --> 02:35:07.160
Look at this, FU to 11 breadsticks.

02:35:07.160 --> 02:35:08.800
Maybe like 6 breadsticks next time.

02:35:08.800 --> 02:35:13.400
I always say 6 breadsticks, but then I'm like, I'm so hungry, and I mean, I was hungry

02:35:13.400 --> 02:35:16.200
not to eat 11, so, you know, 6 might not have been enough.

02:35:16.200 --> 02:35:17.720
Pretty hungry, it's pretty hungry.

02:35:17.720 --> 02:35:20.920
Alright, that is going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

02:35:20.920 --> 02:35:23.720
Thank you guys so much for tuning into our show tonight.

02:35:23.720 --> 02:35:26.360
If you like what you heard here at Orange Lounge Radio, please tell a friend or five

02:35:26.360 --> 02:35:27.360
about the show.

02:35:27.360 --> 02:35:31.520
Help us spread the word, we don't have any big magazine behind us or anything like that.

02:35:31.520 --> 02:35:34.720
Word of mouth is all we got, so we can be the show where every gamer has a voice, but

02:35:34.720 --> 02:35:37.920
only if the voices are here to air on air.

02:35:37.920 --> 02:35:41.760
A nice five star review on a place like iTunes goes a long way as well.

02:35:41.760 --> 02:35:45.280
If you have not yet written a review for the show on iTunes, please consider doing

02:35:45.280 --> 02:35:46.280
that.

02:35:46.280 --> 02:35:47.640
I really, really, really appreciate that.

02:35:47.640 --> 02:35:52.360
Again, not asking you to donate money or anything like that, just take 15 seconds to write a

02:35:52.360 --> 02:35:53.360
review.

02:35:53.360 --> 02:35:54.480
It would be awesome.

02:35:54.480 --> 02:35:56.560
Really appreciate that.

02:35:56.560 --> 02:35:57.560
That's going to do it.

02:35:57.560 --> 02:36:02.520
Let's go around and get everybody's final thought for the night, Dark Sakura.

02:36:02.520 --> 02:36:08.540
I really am enjoying the new Jessica Jones comic, which really goes into the regular

02:36:08.540 --> 02:36:11.040
Marvel universe and not the TV series.

02:36:11.040 --> 02:36:12.220
Only worth a read.

02:36:12.220 --> 02:36:14.640
Also resist.

02:36:14.640 --> 02:36:18.040
My final thought is, I'm sorry, I'm not going to be doing streaming after the show tonight,

02:36:18.040 --> 02:36:21.640
even though I wanted to start making that a regular thing after last week went very

02:36:21.640 --> 02:36:22.640
well.

02:36:22.640 --> 02:36:27.040
Thank you guys for checking that out at Twitch TV slash Rob Roberts, cheap plug.

02:36:27.040 --> 02:36:32.200
But I'm actually going to get a new monitor for my studio so I can fix some problems that

02:36:32.200 --> 02:36:34.080
I'm having with the ratio.

02:36:34.080 --> 02:36:38.880
And I haven't had a chance to test the switch broadcasting yet, so I'm not ready to do that

02:36:38.880 --> 02:36:39.880
yet tonight.

02:36:39.880 --> 02:36:44.760
I'm hoping that I can do maybe some Blaster Master next week or whatever game I decide

02:36:44.760 --> 02:36:45.760
I want to do.

02:36:45.760 --> 02:36:48.480
But yeah, so I'm not going to be doing that for the show tonight, which is fine anyway

02:36:48.480 --> 02:36:54.340
because my hiccups are, yeah, I need to go lie down and breathe into a paper bag or something.

02:36:54.340 --> 02:36:57.820
So anyway, last but not least, Loki, your final thought.

02:36:57.820 --> 02:37:02.400
My final thought is, I'm tired.

02:37:02.400 --> 02:37:04.320
That's it.

02:37:04.320 --> 02:37:08.000
Alright, right, that's going to do it for another episode of Orange Launch Radio.

02:37:08.120 --> 02:37:10.120
Thank you guys so much for tuning in tonight.

02:37:10.120 --> 02:37:13.480
We will see you in seven days to do it all over again.

02:37:13.480 --> 02:37:16.820
Until then, don't be a jerk to people online.

02:37:16.820 --> 02:37:17.820
Don't give people the hiccups.

02:37:17.820 --> 02:37:18.820
And have a good night.

02:37:18.820 --> 02:37:19.320
Bye.

02:37:38.000 --> 02:37:42.200
The hiccups in this program do not necessarily reflect those of the staff of Orange Launch

02:37:42.200 --> 02:37:47.000
Radio or VOG Network, but you know they were all still true.

02:37:50.000 --> 02:37:51.000
See you next week.

02:38:08.000 --> 02:38:10.000
See you next time.
