This week, Rocket League Season 3 finally comes to an end, and while the Championship Series continues until one team is crowned, the rest of us get to start ranking all over again. Enjoy your new wheels, there's plenty more to discuss, and it all starts right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.

00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Orange Lounge Radio

3
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Hello my friends out there on the internet, welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight with the 680th episode of our show for this March 19th of 2017. My name is Rob Roberts, here with you in studio with my co-host, say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

4
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
And is that what she wrote? Is that the murder she wrote?

5
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I don't know.

6
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Or as RuPaul says, which I don't talk a lot about the other podcasts I listen to on this show, but I had a five hour car ride today, which I'll get into later.

7
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:16,000
So I listened to a bunch of RuPaul's What's the Tea, because that could be a fun show. I like that show not just because it's RuPaul, and I'm sure you all like, you know, oh Rob likes Drag Race.

8
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
And congrats to RuPaul's marriage, by the way.

9
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Thank you Techmaster Loki, who butted in the conversation, but hi Techmaster Loki as well.

10
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Yes, congrats to Ru, who I think may have got married right around the same time I did. So hey, how about that?

11
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Yay my Ru.

12
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:39,000
But what I wanted to say about that is, she was talking on the show today about murder she wrote, but she calls it this, she said, murder she done sat down and wrote.

13
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:52,000
So now I can't, and like in that RuPaul voice, so now I can't, like I can't get that out of my head. Like I'm worried halfway through tonight's show I might be like, Dark Sakura, let's talk about Squarespace.

14
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
The ads on some of these podcasts are pretty shameless, but I understand there's bills to pay, there's bills to pay.

15
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Well Tech 2030 in the chat room said I should bring back, sup bitches.

16
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
And hello to the chat, everybody's getting introduced early tonight, hi chatters.

17
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Sup bitches.

18
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000
And if you want Dark Sakura to call you a bitch, you can join our live chat room over at live.voggenetwork.com.

19
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I'll call anyone a bitch for free.

20
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Where we do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice Geeks Network, voggenetwork.com, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show, 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern.

21
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Dark Sakura, by the way, I'm going to embarrass her a little bit on the show, but I just want to give a very big thank you for Kitty sitting.

22
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Oh yes.

23
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Over the weekend.

24
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I petted your pussy.

25
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Because I, and you took pictures.

26
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I took pictures of it too.

27
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Without her consent.

28
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,000
But you, okay, so Alan and I took a little road trip out of town this weekend.

29
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Did what we call an emergency trip to Disneyland and Universal.

30
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,000
So those of you that listen to OLR a long, long time know that Dark Sakura and I love Disneyland.

31
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Why was it, Loki has to love Disneyland at least a little bit.

32
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Not on the same crazed level that Dark Sakura and I are at, but Loki.

33
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
He has kids, he probably hates it now.

34
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Did kids ruin Disneyland?

35
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Well, no, they do ruin everything, so that makes sense.

36
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
But no, I haven't taken them to Disneyland yet.

37
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Okay.

38
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
And you know what, that's fine.

39
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I know a lot of newer parents that are like, oh, I've got to take the kids to Disneyland when they're two or when they're three.

40
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I'm like, don't bother.

41
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
They're not going to remember until they're like six or seven.

42
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
No, no, no.

43
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
But it's free before they're five.

44
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I thought it was only like three.

45
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Disney wants that money.

46
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
There ain't no Squarespace paying Disney bills.

47
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
That's why Becky waited to take Julian until he was about to turn five.

48
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Okay, well that, all right, if you're doing it to get around the entry fee, then that I get.

49
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,000
But yeah, I just, you know, don't pay for the kid if they're too young to have the memories.

50
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
That's all I'm saying.

51
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Because I apparently went to Disneyland when I was four, but I don't remember at all.

52
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
But I went to Disneyland when I was eight, and I remember a lot more of that.

53
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
So anyway, where were we?

54
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Dark Sakura, kitty sitting.

55
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:03,000
So Dark Sakura sat for the cat and it's not exactly, we don't exactly live around the corner either.

56
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:09,000
So Dark Sakura really had to take like a 20 minute trip out here to feed the cat a couple of times, which, you know, Alan and I do appreciate.

57
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
So thank you very much.

58
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I had to bribe her.

59
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Well, you got video and stuff and you were putting it all over Facebook.

60
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Well, I only did it once on Facebook, but I sent the other one to you guys.

61
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:25,000
But I had to bribe her out of your underwear, someone's underwear.

62
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Wait a minute.

63
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
She was literally sitting.

64
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Wait a minute.

65
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I don't know.

66
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Hold on.

67
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
What just came?

68
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
What just?

69
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Talk about, talk about murder she sat down and she wrote.

70
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,000
What kind of revelation just came up in episode 680 of the show?

71
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
The Dark Sakura was fucking digging through our underwear when we were home.

72
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
No, I wasn't.

73
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
She was, okay.

74
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:54,000
It was more that she was sitting on like a pair of pants and she was sitting inside the pants like she was about to put them on her legs and go to work.

75
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Okay.

76
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Okay.

77
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
And I was like Sanrio.

78
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
And then I heard meep.

79
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
She, she does that though.

80
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:14,000
She, she cuddles up against, so, so like a lot of married couples, the mister and I have a dirty laundry monster in our bedroom, especially, you know, right before a trip or something like that.

81
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
So it's something about cats.

82
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I think a lot of cats do this.

83
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
They like to find the owner's dirty laundry and snuggle up against it.

84
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
And she does that a lot.

85
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
So she was sitting in the middle of pants, like she was going to wear them.

86
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,000
And so I bring out the bull, shake, shake, shake, shake, Katie, shake, shake, shake, shake.

87
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,000
And then I hear, she's got a little noise.

88
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
She's probably hungry.

89
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:42,000
And so I go in the hall and I put down a piece and she's like looking like, what, what do I do?

90
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I don't, you're a different human.

91
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
She's super shy around people she doesn't know.

92
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
And even though she, she ought to know Jamie by now, but she just, she doesn't.

93
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Food one.

94
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Yeah.

95
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Food one.

96
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Food one.

97
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
So I lured her into where the rest of her food was.

98
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
And she's like, and let me touch her.

99
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Nice.

100
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
So I petted the pussy.

101
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Well, thank you very much.

102
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
It's much appreciated.

103
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
You know, Alan and I are trying to favor some time.

104
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
So you got to, you got to get to, have you been to Universal in the past couple of years?

105
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
No.

106
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Okay.

107
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I've never been.

108
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Oh, okay.

109
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Now here's the thing.

110
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I do think overall Disney is more to do than Universal, but girl, Harry Potter, that ride

111
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
kicked ass.

112
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Like I was really blown away by that ride.

113
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
That was amazing.

114
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
So.

115
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I watched the making of it.

116
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Do that.

117
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Do that for real.

118
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
And just to answer and chat over at LiveDogNetwork.com Dungeon Buster says, did you try Butterbeer

119
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Sky?

120
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Of course I fucking did.

121
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I don't drive all the way to Universal Studios and not have Butterbeer.

122
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Yes, I had it.

123
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
And it was, it was really like, I almost want to get in the car and go back, just have more.

124
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:46,000
But I think all it really is, is a cream soda icy with like melted whipped cream on top.

125
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,000
And by the way, Alan is showing off his new Stein that he paid like fucking 30 bucks for

126
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
at the park.

127
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Cause hello theme park.

128
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Where's most Slytherin one?

129
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
We'll have to go back.

130
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I have to go back.

131
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Anyway.

132
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Now that I have officially been resorted again.

133
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Resorted again.

134
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Well.

135
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
On Pottermore.

136
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
You definitely, you know, Alan and I will catsit.

137
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
You and you and Mr. Dan need to go plan a trip to a Universal and do the.

138
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
We have money and time.

139
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
You can do it.

140
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
You can do it.

141
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I believe in you.

142
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
All right, look, we got to get to video games.

143
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Say hello to tech master Loki.

144
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
And how are you?

145
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Fine.

146
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Good.

147
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
And by the way, folks, tech master Loki producing tonight's show since I had the road trip home,

148
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
uh, I thought tonight was going to be a wing it show.

149
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
We could have done that too.

150
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
But look, but look, you saved the day.

151
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
No, I mean, I, I, I, I, a little structure is good.

152
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Like the show is not scripted people.

153
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
We don't, obviously it's the fun of live radio, but we'd like to have a little structure or

154
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
else this would just be a comp.

155
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Like it, it's, it would be a complete cluster fuck of a podcast as opposed to the kind of

156
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
cluster fuck of podcasts that it is.

157
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Yeah.

158
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
So appreciate it.

159
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
So if you don't like something we talk about tonight, blame Loki this time.

160
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
No, just teasing.

161
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
But, uh, yeah.

162
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Um, everything else is going well this week.

163
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Our programming, is that still a thing that you've been working on?

164
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I took a break on Friday just because I'd been going at, you know, doing it solid for

165
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
the last few weeks.

166
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
So I took a break from it.

167
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:11,000
But the thing I was programming, um, which is basically a demo for a presentation we

168
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
were doing.

169
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Um, that came out.

170
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
All right.

171
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I guess for what it was, it's, you know, it's a prototype.

172
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,000
So, um, it was neat.

173
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
All right.

174
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:28,000
And they liked it because, you know, it's fancy compared to some of the other prototypes

175
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
we made.

176
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
All right.

177
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Well, I'm, I'm excited to, uh, try something that you create.

178
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Uh, if you ever get something that's a public release, I don't know how much I'm going

179
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:41,000
to work on that one because that's more of like, it's a prototype for something that

180
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
another team may eventually decide to develop.

181
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I still may develop it later on.

182
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Um, I don't know how interested anyone would be to try it, but, uh, it's, it's, it's different

183
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I guess.

184
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Um, and, but I actually do want to work.

185
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Now that I've done that, I want to work on my own stuff.

186
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
So I may go back to that.

187
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
All right.

188
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Although I've been playing Skyrim and stuff.

189
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
So, you know, that, that does eat into it.

190
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
We were talking about this before the show because, uh, over, over on Mr. Bobby Blackwell

191
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
show tonight, he was, I don't know if his chat room was teasing him or just pointing

192
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
out the fact that he has not progressed as far in Zelda.

193
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Some other people have, but you know, every, everybody does what they can do with the time

194
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
they have the game.

195
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Dan fell asleep playing it.

196
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Yeah.

197
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
It's just, you do what you can do.

198
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
And I honestly, I'm probably not much further than he is, but Loki, I said, well, Loki,

199
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
how far did you get into it?

200
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
And he said, what would you say?

201
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I played a little bit and then I went back to Skyrim.

202
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Yeah.

203
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
A couple hours.

204
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
And then I went back to Skyrim.

205
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,000
So at least Bobby's probably further along than you are because of that.

206
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I'm in this playthrough of Skyrim 80 hours in.

207
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Oh my gosh.

208
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Oh my gosh.

209
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
All right.

210
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Anyway.

211
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Uh, let's see.

212
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I have my kids play, but I don't think they have multiple save slots in that game.

213
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Do they?

214
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
In Zelda?

215
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Zelda.

216
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I don't think they do.

217
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I think you're right.

218
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Yeah.

219
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
So that was the only thing.

220
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
It's like, no, no, they do.

221
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
They do.

222
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
But there's just a ton of auto.

223
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I take that back.

224
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
There's just a ton of auto saves in there.

225
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:07,000
That's why I'm like, because I remember the first time I played it, but he can't read

226
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
stuff and he's going to screw up my save if I let him do it.

227
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:16,000
So like if I just let him run around and like set fire to things, um, you know, I don't

228
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
know.

229
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I may let him do that next week.

230
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
All right.

231
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Uh, we're going to get into video game news stuff this week with you guys in our chat

232
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
room over at live.vognetwork.com.

233
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Uh, talk about our gaming weeks as well in a moment, but I want to get into tonight's

234
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
kickoff topic, which is kind of a big one.

235
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,000
It's a controversial one, but it's one that's been talked a lot about on social media this

236
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
week.

237
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
So I want to get your take, uh, here in studio for my co-host.

238
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,000
And then I want to get the take out there online, um, as well, uh, in our chat room

239
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
over at live.vognetwork.com.

240
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Um, and it has to do with reviews.

241
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
So y'all probably already know where I'm going with this.

242
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
That's the one word I have to say, and y'all know where I'm going with this.

243
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Um, we talk about reviews oftentimes here on OLR, but I'm curious for you guys, how

244
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
much do reviews ultimately really matter to you?

245
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:05,000
And the reason why I bring this up, of course, is the hubbub of blue about, uh, Jim Sterling's

246
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
review.

247
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
And he's a, you know, he's a popular guy online.

248
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
He has his fans and so forth.

249
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Um, he, he dared, dared OMG to give breath of the wild a mere seven out of 10.

250
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:23,000
And in, you know, true Twitter fashion has been cyber bully because of it essentially,

251
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:30,000
because I believe his score ultimately lowered the Metacritic score of Zelda by one point

252
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,000
and the Metacritic is another whole little thing we can get into, which, but Zelda went

253
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:40,000
down from a 98 to a 97, although to go for it to have been a 98 in the first place, somebody

254
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
else gave it lower than 10 out of 10.

255
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Right.

256
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:48,000
So anyway, he gave it a lower score and what were the reasons he cited?

257
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,000
He, he talked about the, the, uh, durability system, the durability system, to be fair,

258
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
annoys me too.

259
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Honestly, like all of his critiques were basically what I share with that.

260
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I mean, they were just, the durability system is stupid.

261
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:05,000
It's, it's, I don't know what the purpose of it being in here is other than they want

262
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,000
you to try the other weapons maybe, or they're just trying to lengthen the, I don't know

263
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
what the point of it is.

264
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,000
But it's interesting because I feel like, and this is also, I think a difference between

265
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,000
you and me is that like, I recognize those things and I say, yes, they're negative, but

266
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
was my overall experience affected by it?

267
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
No, I probably would still rate this game very highly.

268
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Um, I don't think I've played enough with it to settle on a final score of probably

269
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:36,000
what will be either ultimately a nine or 10, but I still feel like I would not have maybe

270
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:41,000
been as negative, but Jim Sterling has a right to use whatever criteria he wants and a seven

271
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
out of 10 isn't exactly bad.

272
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
DarkSakura, I know you're trying to jump in.

273
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I want to ask all of these people, what does these people, everyone who's been getting

274
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:55,000
fussy at this guy, why the fuck do you care about someone else's opinion if it doesn't

275
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
match your own?

276
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
End of story.

277
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
That's it.

278
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
That goes to religion.

279
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
It goes to fucking politics.

280
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Why did the fuck does it matter so much to you that you want to send death threats and

281
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:11,000
DDoS someone's site just for having a different fucking opinion?

282
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Well, okay.

283
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:19,000
And to be fair, then let's take that statement and apply it to fucking reviews in general.

284
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Why is our industry, I say are the games industry so fixated on reviews in the first place?

285
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Because they want some sort of validation for the product that they've put out.

286
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:40,000
And these people are also probably paid voices and other people are too.

287
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:45,000
A good number of people in this world are really weak willed.

288
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
I'm going to just flat out and say it.

289
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Some people only base their opinion off of the opinions of other people or use that as

290
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,000
their selling point rather than fucking try it for yourself.

291
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:05,000
But okay, I agree to that to a point, but there are friends of mine, you guys included

292
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:10,000
in that, where if you told me that, Rob, you just should stay the hell away from this game

293
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
or Rob, you should really take a look at this game.

294
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I would let that weigh on whether I might play a game or not.

295
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Does that make sense?

296
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
But you actually trust our opinions.

297
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I do.

298
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
The thing is, this is a complete fucking stranger.

299
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Am I a fool?

300
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Just kidding.

301
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
This is a complete fucking stranger.

302
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Okay, but some people feel connected to him the way that some of our listeners, this feels

303
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:34,000
really weird to say, but some of our listeners, I think we are in a position of responsibility

304
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,000
where sometimes the things we say may have an effect.

305
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I'm not trying to sound delusional here, but may have an effect on whether our listeners

306
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
buy a game or not.

307
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
You know what I mean?

308
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
I still don't think that people should necessarily take our word for it.

309
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,000
They need to think for themselves, try it for themselves.

310
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:59,000
And there are ways of, you know, you can go to wherever to buy a game, play it for a couple

311
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:04,000
of days, and if you decide that it is not to your liking, return it.

312
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
There's still rental services out there online.

313
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,000
You know, there are ways to try before you buy.

314
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
No one is infallible.

315
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

316
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:20,000
SSJ100Matt says, I wish Metacritic existed when I spent my money on Silver Surfer NES

317
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
as a kid.

318
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Alex P. Carson says, but you're God.

319
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Well, I know that, but.

320
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Now, now.

321
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
No, but still, you know.

322
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:35,000
So I was going to say, you know, I'm in the reviews here.

323
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
I just thought I'd read some of the comments.

324
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
OK.

325
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Because, you know, you're not supposed to ever read the comments.

326
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
But we're going to for the sake of entertainment.

327
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:45,000
So the featured comment is drink bleach, you fat, miserable cunt.

328
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
That's just.

329
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
That's unnecessary.

330
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
It's unnecessary.

331
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
And it's just it's just that's just straight up cyberbullied.

332
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Like, I laugh, but I laugh because it's fucking awkward.

333
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
You know what I mean?

334
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Like, it's like, ha ha ha.

335
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:01,000
My this person might be a mass murderer and I got to go like.

336
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Well, the other the other thing, too, though, is that I mean, when we ask our friends something,

337
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
we know things about our friends.

338
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
We know things.

339
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
We know their personality.

340
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
We know the other kind of games they like.

341
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:29,000
And if you've ever played a game that they enjoy and you enjoyed it, chances are their opinion will matter because they like the same things that you do in that or because, you know, oh, this person really is into adventure games and they'll be really critical of it.

342
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:38,000
And if they say, you know what, I enjoyed this game, then you know that this person who's normally critical of the genre enjoyed themselves and then you can buy the game.

343
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:52,000
But I think, though, that you also have to look for the sake because as far as I'm aware, this Jim Sterling guy tends to like to shake things up anyway to give an unpopular opinion because it gives him attention.

344
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:57,000
In the long run, that's really is this whole attention grabbing thing.

345
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:04,000
And so that's why I really don't want to put a lot of stock into his words, because he does shit like that.

346
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:11,000
I'm also just bringing it up because he is the focus of all this right now and, you know, the comment that Loki read, you know, he's getting it.

347
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:19,000
But you do offer a fair criticism that it could be for attention.

348
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
It's not. And that's kind of the misunderstanding.

349
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Go ahead. Go ahead.

350
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:31,000
That's kind of the misunderstanding with under, you know, he takes on a lot of different issues with different opinions on that stuff.

351
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:35,000
But I wouldn't say he does things strictly for the attention.

352
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Yeah. I mean, now, don't get me wrong. I think there are things he does do for attention.

353
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,000
The whole the whole thing with the monetization on YouTube.

354
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
He made a brilliant counter argument for all that.

355
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:50,000
I think it's because it's yeah, it's it's just I think he figured that out by accident.

356
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Yeah. But anyway, that whole thing.

357
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:58,000
But I mean, but that's not. Yes. Again, it's like not necessarily bad in a way, too.

358
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:05,000
I think his criticisms of Zelda were fine, like, and it's OK that he only gave it a seven of 10.

359
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:10,000
I think so. I'm not saying that matches my opinion or whatever, but I also recognize.

360
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,000
OK, flip the tables a little bit and let's say we're talking about movies.

361
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Has there ever been an Oscar winning movie where you were like, that was a fucking bad movie?

362
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,000
It's not even like right. Probably just within the last 10 of them that won an Oscar.

363
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
You can probably think of one where you were like, you know, that movie wasn't very good.

364
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I was super glad La La Land didn't win one.

365
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:35,000
All right. Or but OK. But as much as people are saying, you know, there's this backlash against La La Land,

366
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:40,000
it still did get 14 nominations. Right. So and I haven't seen it. I have no opinion.

367
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:47,000
But so there's a lot of that, whereas a lot of people disagree with the fact that that film should have even got nominated 14 things.

368
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:54,000
So our Suicide Squad one one, which I'm not I'm going to say I liked the makeup job in it, which was what it went for.

369
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:59,000
But it wasn't really that great of a move. That was all it was bad.

370
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:03,000
That was all it was was some good makeup, some good beaten. It wasn't even great makeup.

371
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:09,000
I mean, it was OK. It was I think there's other other movies that did way better.

372
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:15,000
But I mean, on top of that, though, I.

373
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:24,000
It's just I think that if you were going to go to look at a reviewer, don't just look at the the number read, read what they say about.

374
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Yes. Yes. Don't do it. Yes. Yes. Don't do it too long. Didn't read.

375
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:35,000
I bet. I bet to a lot of people out there, if you took the score away from Jim Sterling's article

376
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:42,000
and you took the score away from another, let's say, nine out of 10 article to somebody who really didn't know the styles of the two reviewers,

377
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
I bet somebody would not be able to tell the difference is easy.

378
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,000
What? And you ask them, like, what score did this game ultimately get from this reviewer?

379
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:53,000
I bet. I bet you would get different answers. You know what I mean?

380
00:19:53,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Well, and on top of that, you know, I the types of reviews that I enjoy, if they're going to do some kind of summary to the effect,

381
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:13,000
then they should have a pro con list, you know, and on top of that, too, reviews are opinions, you know, and opinions are like genitals.

382
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Some people have to some people have different ones, but everyone doesn't look the same.

383
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:28,000
And you don't necessarily want to get into someone's pants to find out now before before some I get the email on this because I know it's going to be coming.

384
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:33,000
There's going to be an email or something or a chat. I'm surprised the chat comment hasn't happened yet that says, well, wait a minute, Rob.

385
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:37,000
What about a vog network dot com? Don't you guys review things and you leave scores?

386
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Yes, we do. But a we use a different scoring system than out of 10.

387
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:51,000
And a lot of thought went into that because especially with things like video games, you're you like we use the schoolhouse grading basically because an F is failure.

388
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Everything above an F at least has like some redeeming qualities to it.

389
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Right. Whereas I feel like in gaming, anything below a five out of 10 or fuck now in this case, a seven out of 10 is viewed as a failure.

390
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
And I feel like the great how schooling gives you a little more leeway with that.

391
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:12,000
But the more important thing is that we also encourage on our website for people to leave their own counter opinions right there.

392
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:17,000
And as long as you don't say, what was that drink bleach, you fat cunt or whatever those get moderated out.

393
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:27,000
But as long as the review is intelligent, we're perfectly happy to put here is a dissenting opinion right next to the review score that we gave it.

394
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:33,000
But I still don't think that people should in general put their soul.

395
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Right. Judgment right on the opinion of somebody else, even on a review that's on our site.

396
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:47,000
And who cares if it's Metacritic went from 98 to 97. Oh, shit. It's 97. I'm sorry. I can't buy that game anymore.

397
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:52,000
But on top of that, though, it's just like I have I have a friend.

398
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:59,000
I mean, I'm sure everyone in this room knows this particular friend of mine who will was always only saying, well, they got bad reviews.

399
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:03,000
I don't want to play it. It got bad reviews. I don't want to play it. And then I'll go and play the game.

400
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000
I'll be like, whatever. This was really great.

401
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:15,000
You know why? And there's there's some games that you're going to like more than another gamer, just because it's the type of game that you're into.

402
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:20,000
For example, or or and music games. Right.

403
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:26,000
I'm going to openly admit I'm always going to have a little more leeway in my heart for a music based game.

404
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:34,000
That's just, you know, music games are part of the reason why this show exists. Music games are, you know, a big part of my passion and so forth.

405
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:40,000
So there's always going to be a little bit part of me that just because it's a music game, I'm going to kind of look over and be like, oh, maybe I should try that one.

406
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Now, of course, one could argue it also can make me more critical of a bad music game.

407
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Being groovy. Yeah. Well, that that's just a bad game period.

408
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:56,000
But, you know, there's there's a little bit of that coming on is that sometimes your your own little like personal like genres that you're into and things like that are going to going to come into play.

409
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,000
The other thing I would say with this, OK, like Blaster Master Zero.

410
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,000
I've been playing a lot of that game since it came out on the switch.

411
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:07,000
And I think that game is getting like maybe eights, sevens and eights.

412
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Like it's it's doing good, but it's not like Zelda good. Right.

413
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:17,000
But like for me, that game is a 10 out of 10 for me.

414
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:24,000
But even if I were to like review that on VOG, I wouldn't necessarily give it an A plus because I recognize that the game is flawed.

415
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:31,000
But for me, I still embrace it flaws and all because it's the type of game that I just I really enjoy.

416
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Well, and to go back to what I was saying about, you know, it wasn't the right term I meant for it, but the weak willed comment.

417
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:45,000
It more has to do, I think, with people who are so looking for a validation of their own opinion.

418
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Yeah. That the moment something gets a contrary score.

419
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Yeah. They take it as personal insult. Yeah. And no, that means you need you need help.

420
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:06,000
I mean, seriously, when you go in and you think that it's OK to call somebody something like that because of a difference of opinion, you know, that's not OK.

421
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Now, when this difference of opinion is being used to repress entire groups or to take away health care from people, that's a different story.

422
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:21,000
But if it is just I don't like this game that you like.

423
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Fuck you. It's entertainment. You don't. These are all this is all entertainment.

424
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:31,000
It's not that serious. You don't have the right to be a shit to somebody just because they don't like the same game you do.

425
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Something you want to interject, Loki? Oh, I said or DDoS their site. Yeah.

426
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Yeah, of course. Trying to look in chat, of course, over at live.vognetwork.com.

427
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:44,000
MXC says to me, review scores don't deserve to be viewed as particularly important.

428
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:49,000
It's the words of a review which really tell you someone's view. But no one wants to read words.

429
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:56,000
That's why I made the review score on my site images of alpacas because it's mostly meaningless and cute.

430
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:01,000
I like that. Bobby, we should talk about alpacas.

431
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Let's see. They're floofy. What's that? They're floofy. They are very floofy and fun.

432
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:13,000
And you can make hats out of their fur. Although then again, we probably shouldn't steal a scoring system from someone else's site.

433
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:20,000
So I will retract that comment. Tigerclawnchat says, it's things like that why I distance myself from fandom in general.

434
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:25,000
When someone crosses the line, you want no part of it. We'll rate them based on like cuteness of a puppy.

435
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:31,000
So we'll have like a really ugly picture of a puppy. Yeah, but even ugly dogs can be cute. Like that's that's all subjective.

436
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Exactly. Isn't there like an ugly dog's website and like like uglydogoftheday.com or something and like people will go there and be like,

437
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Oh God, that dog is so ugly. It's so precious. I love it. You know, right? Like there's no such thing as an ugly dog.

438
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Let's see. SH2100matt in chat says, the sad thing is that the Internet will forget this reviewer and their review in a few weeks.

439
00:25:54,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Angry Internet has a short attention span, which is sad that they cause all this damage for what they will care about for a short time.

440
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:07,000
So let me let me transition into this a little bit. I know we have other news stories about this game later on tonight.

441
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:14,000
I don't want to I don't want to put the cart before the horse. But speaking of reviews and all this stuff, it goes without saying,

442
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:18,000
I have to bring up some of this early stuff that's coming up for Mass Effect Andromeda.

443
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:25,000
So there is a lot of like early stuff out there. We'll get into some of the nitty gritty of it a little later.

444
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:33,000
But Dark Sakura, knowing that people are playing Mass Effect Andromeda on Origin right now and seeing some of the feedback out there,

445
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:40,000
does that affect your anticipation for the game whatsoever? No. No. Me neither.

446
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:47,000
You know why? I'm taking a lot of that stuff with a grain of salt right now because A, the Blaster Master Zero comment I made,

447
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:57,000
some things I'm just going to be more into than others. And that's OK. And B, just the fact that after what happened with Mass Effect 3,

448
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:05,000
I don't trust social media in general to get it right. I just don't. After what happened with Mass Effect 3's ending and all that bullshit,

449
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:13,000
like, in my opinion, although yes, Extended Cut made the Mass Effect 3 ending stronger and I'm glad it exists,

450
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:20,000
I think the internet got way fucking bent out of shape with Mass Effect's ending and it was a total fucking mob mentality

451
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,000
and I feel like the same thing is happening with Andromeda.

452
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:33,000
I've seen some of the videos that they're posting of like, here's some of the bad animations and honestly I have to stare at them like I don't see what the bad animation is.

453
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:38,000
I mean there were some that were silly, like I got stuck in a crouch animation, which is fine, it's a glitch.

454
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:44,000
But I didn't see anything that was like, holy shit, my face is missing Ubisoft type thing.

455
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Yeah, and it's like, OK, a lot again. Not that I'm giving the industry a pass, I mean games need to be tested.

456
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:56,000
But, I mean, god, don't we see the same shit in Ubisoft games? Bethesda games?

457
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:04,000
I think, oh god, Bethesda's no for that shit. I think it's even worse with Ubisoft games.

458
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:13,000
I don't know, I mean I haven't really seen anything too bad yet, and so what, I like watching those videos, I think it's funny.

459
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Yeah, well you know, I can take a fucking joke, like there's the Mass Effect, what are those videos that Alan watches, I don't even know if he's listening,

460
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:29,000
is it called YouTube Poop or something like that where they do the bad cutscenes and they take the dialogue and they splice it together

461
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:35,000
and that's the one where Shepard's like, well bang, OK. That shit is funny to me, that's OK.

462
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Or they make the really ugly characters.

463
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:45,000
And sometimes there are bugs in video games and yet those bugs can actually be a little charming.

464
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:52,000
And that goes all the way back to the NES days. Sometimes there are funky things that happen with retro titles that actually make them a little charming.

465
00:28:52,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Hell, that character in Zelda II The Adventure Link, where it goes, I am error, wasn't that whole thing a mistranslation or something?

466
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
It was supposed to be like Errol or something.

467
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:07,000
Yeah, and now you see that shit on t-shirts.

468
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:16,000
So, anyway, I don't know, I just, yeah, TigerKlineChad says, Mass Effect Andromeda is the result of fans wanting more Mass Effect,

469
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:20,000
so the developers have to come up with something that doesn't shit on what happened during the previous games.

470
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Well, I mean, I get that's why the story is what it is and they had to distance it from the initial trilogy,

471
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:32,000
but I don't know, I just, this is one of those games where I'm not going to fucking listen to the internet,

472
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:36,000
I'm going to play it for myself and see what I think, I'll let you all know what I think,

473
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:40,000
and then you can take my opinion and let it weigh on yours or not.

474
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:44,000
I'll tell you whose opinion I've taken into account has been Shane's.

475
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
He's only played multiplayer.

476
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:52,000
No, he played single player. He finally cracked. He played single player.

477
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:56,000
But I took his opinion on multiplayer because I know he would be critical of it.

478
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Right.

479
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:01,000
And so his opinion mattered to me. It was the type of opinion I was looking for.

480
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:06,000
But he's also a friend who's as enthusiastic about Mass Effect as you are,

481
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:11,000
and so you expect that his opinion is going to align closely with your own.

482
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:18,000
And that is why I think that going to a reviewer, a stranger,

483
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:24,000
doesn't necessarily make a good reason to try or not try a game.

484
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
You should go to the people you know.

485
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:35,000
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, run.

486
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:39,000
And also maybe in the case of Jim Sterling, because certainly he has his fans,

487
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:44,000
and he makes funny YouTube videos like we were talking about earlier,

488
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:48,000
that make good points sometimes with the whole YouTube money thing and all that.

489
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,000
Well yeah, that's just YouTube bullshit that he figured that out by mistake because...

490
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Or the Konami shit. He did a great job with that. He really did.

491
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Yeah, fuck Konami.

492
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
So he did a great job with all this stuff.

493
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Again, I kind of go, but a 7 out of 10 is also not a terrible score.

494
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,000
It's not, it's just people overreacting. That's what it is.

495
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Anyway, am I into Zelda games? I'm probably going to be okay with it.

496
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:14,000
He's got to take it in your gut reaction. It's like, okay, was that overreacting? Yes, that's overreacting.

497
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:21,000
But also, read or listen to, depending on what you're doing with him, what he's saying,

498
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:24,000
and make your judgment based on that because maybe you'll be reading the thing and say,

499
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:31,000
oh, it's just durability and these things. Like, I don't think, that just sounds like a harder Zelda game,

500
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
and I've been looking for that. I'm okay with that.

501
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:40,000
But there's a difference between a harder Zelda game like Zelda 2 and bullshit durability system Zelda

502
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:46,000
with the fucking Radio Tower shit where you got climate. That is fucking dumb. It is pretty dumb.

503
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
No, I like the towers.

504
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:57,000
Zelda isn't perfect, but it is one of the most well polished games in a very, very long time.

505
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:01,000
No, I'm not going to argue that it's not polished, but my god, they didn't need the durability system in there.

506
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:06,000
You know I agree with you, but it doesn't ruin the game for me.

507
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:13,000
They can tone it down like a sword shouldn't be breaking. Maybe you can have it where it just does less damage after a while.

508
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:19,000
I would love for there, and some people are going to strongly disagree with me, so have at it.

509
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:25,000
I would love for there to just be an easy mode in Zelda, and in easy mode, the weapons take three times as long to break.

510
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
Or they don't.

511
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
I could see where you'd get overburdened, because everybody's telling me like,

512
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:34,000
oh Rob, at the end of the game you get weapons so fast that you don't even know what's going on.

513
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Okay, that's great if I'm going to make it to the end of the game, because I'm getting annoyed at the beginning of it.

514
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Then perhaps don't do that. If you have so many weapons that it's just an onslaught.

515
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:50,000
Like right now, I find myself using the weakest weapons that I have against enemies.

516
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
Because I'm like, oh shit, I want to break these good ones.

517
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:56,000
And that's kind of a stupid way to play. I would think you'd want to use the most powerful weapon.

518
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
It's because of the stupid system.

519
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:02,000
Granted, I've only played it for two hours, so it doesn't really bother me too much.

520
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:09,000
But I play Skyrim where I'm carrying literally, I mean granted I've, you know, glitched that game out to all hell.

521
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
Weapons break in that game, though.

522
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,000
No, they don't.

523
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,000
Oh, I thought they did wear down.

524
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
No, they don't. They never break.

525
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
You have to go to the blacksmith and...

526
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
To smith new weapons, to make new weapons.

527
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
I thought I had a durability thing.

528
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
No durability at all.

529
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
Alright, anyway.

530
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:30,000
So, you know, one other thing I'll say on this, and I swear I'll move on.

531
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:37,000
You know, you can take the opinions of your friends and the people online that you participate with.

532
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Whether it be us or another show, or a YouTube or whatever.

533
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:46,000
You can take all that with a grain of salt and then form your own opinion on the games and have fun with whatever game it is you're into.

534
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:52,000
But the other thing that I've grown to really appreciate is the rise of streaming in all this.

535
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,000
With, you know, we were talking about this a little bit last week at Tava Show.

536
00:33:55,000 --> 00:34:02,000
I think streaming has become a great way for me to check out, quote unquote, a game that I'm on the fence about.

537
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:08,000
And I have been swayed both ways on the fence on a game I was on the fence about by checking out streaming.

538
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:14,000
Because it lets me see a little more of the game in its natural habitat.

539
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Outside of the parameters of what the PR team approved for cutting to be released and all that stuff.

540
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,000
You know what I mean, right?

541
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Like, when you're seeing streaming, you're seeing the raw game being played.

542
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:31,000
So, that's another way that I, at least myself, will certainly, especially when I'm on the fence, have my decision made.

543
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,000
But anyway.

544
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:36,000
Let's talk about, well thank you SJ100Matt over in chat.

545
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:40,000
SJ100Matt says, this show has sold me on many games in the past.

546
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,000
Well, we appreciate that.

547
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:45,000
At the end of the day, if you like something we didn't like, we'll still take your call.

548
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,000
We still want to hear from you.

549
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:52,000
If you hated a game that we did like and you want to yell at us for having you spent 60 bucks you shouldn't have spent.

550
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:56,000
We will caution you that, hey buddy, you're the one that made the decision at the end of the day.

551
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,000
But we will still allow your counter opinion on the show.

552
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
We're happy to have it.

553
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:09,000
Anyway, let's talk about where our hard earned spent money has gone this week in a segment about the types of video games that we have been playing this week.

554
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
How is your gaming week?

555
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,000
DarkSakura.

556
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:14,000
It has been all Zelda all the time.

557
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,000
And some World of Warcraft.

558
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,000
Miitomo.

559
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,000
Best Move.

560
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:22,000
And Pokemon Go.

561
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,000
Busy busy.

562
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
Not really.

563
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,000
Alright.

564
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000
And that's it.

565
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,000
That's it.

566
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,000
Loki, how about you?

567
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
How was your gaming week?

568
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,000
My gaming week, I played a little bit of Pokemon Go.

569
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:37,000
Just because I was still in midtown so there was lots of PokeStops there.

570
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:42,000
I played, I bought Zelda on Friday.

571
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:46,000
So I picked up that and I played a couple hours on Friday night.

572
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,000
But I haven't really played it since then.

573
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:52,000
Just because I've been really into Skyrim.

574
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,000
So in Skyrim I've been finishing, I've been doing different quest lines.

575
00:35:55,000 --> 00:36:00,000
So now I've finished the Dark Brotherhood quest line.

576
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:06,000
I'm starting the whole Stormcloaks quest line.

577
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:11,000
And I'm going to be doing probably the Way of the Voice stuff as well.

578
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
So just kind of doing all that stuff.

579
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:16,000
And then maybe once I get around to it, do some of the side quests.

580
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,000
Clean all that radiant quest stuff I have up.

581
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
I'm really enjoying it quite a bit.

582
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:29,000
With Zelda, like I said, I played it a couple hours.

583
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
It was a pretty game. I liked it.

584
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:37,000
One thing that kind of annoyed me from the get-go is like I was trying to not use tilt controls.

585
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:40,000
Because I didn't realize it was turned on.

586
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:45,000
And so I was using the right analog stick and I kept wondering why I couldn't aim very well.

587
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
Because it just kept moving my cursor around.

588
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:50,000
And it's because the tilt controls are on.

589
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
Like they put that on default.

590
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Because Nintendo has to fucking push their goddamn fucking tilt controls for every goddamn thing.

591
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:04,000
I wish there was like, hey, this is an option. Do you want tilt controls or do you want to use your fucking analog stick?

592
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:11,000
I wish that was given to me instead of just, hey, you're a Nintendo user so you're going to love those fucking tilt controls.

593
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:14,000
Because we need to justify putting that shit in there.

594
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:20,000
But once I figured that out, then that was alright.

595
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:24,000
Durability hasn't really bothered me too much yet, but still very early in the game.

596
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
It is kind of annoying.

597
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:31,000
But I think what's even worse is it's no whole inventory management shit.

598
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:35,000
It's fucking feeling a lot like No Man's Sky.

599
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Where I'm getting all these weapons and it's like, oh shit, I got to manage my inventory and drop shit that I don't need.

600
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:44,000
So I was like, I don't need to be doing this and it was all the game.

601
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,000
I shouldn't be doing it. Just don't hand out as many weapons then.

602
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,000
I don't know.

603
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,000
So that's it.

604
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,000
Alright.

605
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:58,000
My gaming week, I must admit, was a little light because of the theme park trip that I did this weekend.

606
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,000
So that really ate into my gaming week.

607
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Unless you want to count doing Buzz Lightyear and Midway Mania as gaming.

608
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,000
Because you know I got to ride those rides when I'm at Disneyland.

609
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:13,000
But yeah, I didn't really play a lot of games.

610
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:16,000
I was driving too, so I didn't really get to play on the trip or anything.

611
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
No Pokemon Go at Disneyland?

612
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
Okay, funny you should bring that up.

613
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,000
I binged on Pokemon Go. Thank god I have the plus, right?

614
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:26,000
So like, oh man, just everywhere.

615
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Just walking around, it's like boop boop boop boop.

616
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:33,000
Not a lot of rare stuff, although we did spot an Aerodactyl, which I know is a 10k of a lot of people.

617
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:36,000
I have three of them by now, but I've hatched a bunch of them.

618
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:42,000
But I know that was the one Pokemon that a friend of mine, who by the way never gets super into video games.

619
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:46,000
He's always been like a casual gamer, but he's like fucking super into Pokemon Go.

620
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
Like he's further along than I am.

621
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:54,000
And yeah, the Aerodactyl was the one thing he needed to complete his Gen 1 decks, right?

622
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:59,000
So like I always would give him shit, and every time I see one or I hatch one, I'd send him a screenshot and I'd say,

623
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Hey, you should come visit, or whatever.

624
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,000
So funny enough, I did that when I was at Disneyland.

625
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:08,000
I sent like a screenshot and I said, hey, look at what's over here at Disneyland.

626
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,000
Do you have an excuse to come?

627
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:12,000
And like five minutes after I sent that, he said, look what just hatched.

628
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,000
OMG, I'm shaking.

629
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
And he got his Aerodactyl finally.

630
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,000
So it was funny.

631
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:22,000
But anyway, Meryl's were the thing that I don't see a lot of otherwise.

632
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,000
So I don't know if there was a nest there at California Adventure or something, but that was that.

633
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
But here's the thing.

634
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:34,000
So finally at night, around probably like 8 or 9 o'clock, like every time I would catch a Pokemon,

635
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,000
my Pogo Plus would be like, you've been disconnected.

636
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,000
And I'm like, what the fuck?

637
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
And I was getting really, really annoyed.

638
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:44,000
Well, it turns out, reading some stuff online and so forth, my battery died on the trip.

639
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:47,000
So I used that Pogo Plus all day long.

640
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:52,000
And keep in mind, I use that thing when I do lunch breaks at work to get walking credit for the eggs.

641
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:58,000
I've walked around downtown for, God, just when JD was visiting last week, we walked around downtown

642
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
and I was using that thing nonstop.

643
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,000
So I'm not surprised the battery just fucking finally died.

644
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:07,000
But unfortunately, I didn't plan ahead and bring a spare watch battery.

645
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
So I didn't get to do any Pokemon.

646
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
They're not rechargeable?

647
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
No, they use watch batteries.

648
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
Oh, fucking hell.

649
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,000
You didn't realize that? No.

650
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,000
That's so stupid.

651
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,000
Yep, they use watch batteries.

652
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,000
Way to go.

653
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:23,000
Well, to be fair, they last a long time.

654
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
I mean, I'm a power user for those things, Loki.

655
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,000
They last a long time.

656
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,000
It doesn't matter, then that's fine.

657
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,000
Have a rechargeable...

658
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,000
That's dumb.

659
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,000
Yeah, no, that's not rechargeable.

660
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,000
That's so fucking dumb.

661
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:34,000
So, I guess get a rechargeable watch battery or something.

662
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,000
But yeah, so I have to switch it out.

663
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
I didn't get to use it at all at Universal.

664
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
So, I was really irritated.

665
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:43,000
But at the same time, I was like, okay, hey, your inventory...

666
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:46,000
Well, yeah, and I did to get my bonuses and here and there.

667
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
But that thing is a fucking drain on your phone.

668
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:57,000
We had to bring, excuse me, our giant battery that is the highest amount of volts of a battery you can bring on an airplane.

669
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:04,000
That's what we brought with us to Disneyland and had in our little bag so we could charge with us.

670
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
And so that was good for Disney that day.

671
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:16,000
But yeah, the amount of power I used when I couldn't play Pokemon Go versus when I was playing it on Saturday was just like a crazy difference.

672
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,000
So anyway, yes, there was that.

673
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
I did play a lot of Pokemon Go.

674
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:24,000
Otherwise, I continued playing Blaster Master Zero.

675
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,000
Honestly, didn't get to do a lot of Zelda this week.

676
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:30,000
And this may come as a surprise to some people too.

677
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:34,000
I know the Mass Effect Andromeda thing is on the early access for the EA subscribers.

678
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
I chose not to do it.

679
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:42,000
As much as Shane tried to get me on it, I don't know if he did this to you too, Dark Sakura,

680
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,000
but he was really trying to convince me to get the EA access thing.

681
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,000
But two things.

682
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:51,000
A, I knew I would be out of town all this weekend so the only time I would have got to play that would have been Thursday night.

683
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:57,000
And tomorrow night, assuming I don't get it early from Amazon, which sometimes happens,

684
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:00,000
but after the whole Switch debacle, I don't know if it will or not.

685
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:05,000
But also, B, I just kind of didn't want to support what EA was doing with that.

686
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:11,000
I just didn't want to support the whole, oh, you have to be a member of our Netflix thing to get a 10-hour early access.

687
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:14,000
I can fucking wait five more days to do it.

688
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:20,000
The fact that I did theme parks over the weekend I think helps, but I didn't want to do it.

689
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
So that was all.

690
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,000
Shane tried to tempt me.

691
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:29,000
I think multiplayer would have been a lot of fun, but I was like, no, I can pack on Thursday night and do things to take my mind off it

692
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:35,000
and then I'll be ready for it on Tuesday when it arrives on PlayStation 4, which is where I'm doing it

693
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:39,000
because I'm curious about the whole PlayStation 4 Pro and all the stuff they've been doing with that.

694
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:42,000
I'm curious to see how that's going to look.

695
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
So we'll see.

696
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,000
All right.

697
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
Let's get into some gaming news.

698
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:50,000
I do want to just mention some quick housekeeping.

699
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:53,000
We will, I believe we are not going to be here.

700
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
I don't know if we firmly, firmly figured that out.

701
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:58,000
I don't think we're going to be here April 9th.

702
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:04,000
But that is the day after Sac Indie Arcade, which I think we did in years past anyway.

703
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:12,000
We're going to be broadcasting all day long that Saturday from the West Sacramento Convention Center with our pals at Sacramento IGDA.

704
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:15,000
Looks like some of the speakers have come out for this year's show.

705
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,000
It's going to be a lot of fun.

706
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:20,000
That will be all day long on VOG starting at about, I don't have the exact times yet.

707
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:24,000
I think it's going to be about noon Pacific for about five hours.

708
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:27,000
So we'll be broadcasting for the West Sacramento Convention Center that.

709
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:33,000
But the next day there won't be an OLR because of the fact that we would have streamed all day long before that.

710
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:38,000
And Jamie and I have a longtime friend who is going to be in town visiting from Japan that day.

711
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
So sorry, not sorry, guys.

712
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:45,000
But if we are giving you five hours the day before, we're going to take the night off to hang with our friend.

713
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:49,000
So that will be April 9th when that show will not be here.

714
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:52,000
So let's move on.

715
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:55,000
Otherwise, twitter.com slash OLR, facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

716
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
Let's get into some gaming news for the night.

717
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,000
Loki.

718
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:04,000
Yeah. So according to a Wall Street Journal, Nintendo is supposed to be increasing their production of the switch.

719
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:07,000
So that's going to be up.

720
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:13,000
I guess they're going to be producing 16 million units for the next financial year.

721
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:20,000
So between, I guess, April 1st and March 31st of 2018.

722
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:27,000
Apparently, I guess they're saying that the switch broke the 48-hour sales record for console debut from Nintendo.

723
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:30,000
So that's pretty awesome.

724
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,000
Yeah.

725
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
Didn't we get into that last week, though? That's a little bit.

726
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:39,000
Yeah, a little bit. I mean, but this is kind of just more of just confirming that they're going to be making more.

727
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:42,000
These are kind of the receipts to what Reggie Fils-May was saying earlier.

728
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:46,000
Right. Well, that's more. I think it's still Reggie saying that to Wall Street Journal.

729
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,000
OK. Fair enough.

730
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
Yeah, it's still what they're saying.

731
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
The production going up is...

732
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
It is a good thing.

733
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
I want to see if the demand is going to sustain.

734
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:58,000
Why doesn't the classic NES production ever double?

735
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,000
That's what I'd like to know.

736
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,000
What the fuck is up with that?

737
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:04,000
I still like to pick up one at some point if they're even making them anymore.

738
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,000
I haven't seen one.

739
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:08,000
Well, I've never seen one on the fucking shelf. Never.

740
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:11,000
But it's ridiculous.

741
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:15,000
They shouldn't be able to produce a Linux computer that quickly.

742
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:19,000
I just figured at some point they were going to like fold that into the Switch.

743
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:28,000
Like they were just going to put out like a classic NES pack game for the Switch that was just going to be like a $30 game that would just have those same 30 titles.

744
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:31,000
And your Switch, voila, is an NES.

745
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
I'm just waiting for that.

746
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:36,000
At least the controllers would go further.

747
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
So here's something funny.

748
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:44,000
The Switch, of course, like most modern gaming consoles, has parental controls built into the Switch.

749
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:49,000
So you can monitor when your kids are playing and for how long and that type of stuff.

750
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:54,000
However, apparently it can be bypassed by merely going offline.

751
00:45:54,000 --> 00:46:01,000
So if you take your Switch offline, then it will stop the tracking of playtime.

752
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
Whoops.

753
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:12,000
Well, but it does show an interesting component of how Nintendo's smartphone apps are tapped in through the internet through some type of central Nintendo server.

754
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:19,000
I'm thinking ahead to this whole voice chat thing that they're doing because I'm still really curious like how is that going to look through the app and all this.

755
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:26,000
And the bits and pieces that you're picking up about Nintendo is that this app is going to have more than just a fucking telephone.

756
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:31,000
Like they talk about what the whole schedule playtime session was with your friends and stuff like that.

757
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:34,000
Like they want to have something a little more robust than that.

758
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:41,000
So it's interesting how for a company that we razz over and over again for never being able to understand online,

759
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:48,000
it's interesting how Nintendo is now almost tapped, as this story might lead you to believe, too much into online.

760
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:54,000
Yeah, because apparently one of the things with the way this works, like so you set like, okay, my kids can play for four hours.

761
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:59,000
So if they take it offline, if they don't take it offline, then the console shuts off after four hours.

762
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:04,000
If they take it offline, it stops ticking that timer and then...

763
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:08,000
Because the console doesn't read the time online or whatever or something.

764
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:16,000
Yeah, which is weird that it couldn't just read the clock on the console and, you know, cache that stuff to the console because, you know, that would make sense in case of any sort of hiccups.

765
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:23,000
Unless what's really happening is that Nintendo's central server is sending the message that says shut off, playtime's over.

766
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:27,000
Like that message isn't, that message is coming from the cloud. Everything's being controlled from the cloud.

767
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:33,000
Wow, that'd be scary that that couldn't be exploited somehow if there's a way to send all those consoles to shut off.

768
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:37,000
Well, after clouds showed up in Smash Brothers, he's fucking everywhere now, Loki.

769
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,000
He is.

770
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:40,000
I'm gonna...

771
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:44,000
Just be glad, be glad, just be glad the parental controls are not run by Bayonetta.

772
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:48,000
He's gonna bust your gameplay by shutting your console.

773
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:55,000
Is this parental control, would you use this app with your kids, Loki?

774
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:59,000
No, I would just go fucking turn the system off. I'd be like...

775
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:03,000
You're gonna do it the old school way, like the parents just take the fucking cord.

776
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:08,000
It's not even that. Like, for example, now with their tablets, hey, time to turn your tablet off, which I know what that means.

777
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:11,000
I'm not gonna fucking turn my tablet off until you rip it out of my hands.

778
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:17,000
And that's what I do. I'm like, fuck it, I told you to turn that shit off. I'm taking it away now.

779
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:20,000
And occasionally I forget to charge it. You know, that too.

780
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:26,000
Has the kid ever given you a line like Jamie gave her parents, which she told on this show, didn't Jamie...

781
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:29,000
Didn't your mom take the cord away or something and you threatened to sue her?

782
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:36,000
She took my TV out of my room. I went and got it back and I said, this doesn't belong to you, it was given to me.

783
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:41,000
What happens when the kid pulls that, Loki?

784
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:47,000
I'll just put it up on a high shelf. He's short, he can't get up in there.

785
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,000
Fair enough.

786
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,000
I had a step stool.

787
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
He can get a ladder, he still can't reach it.

788
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:58,000
Just don't let your kids hang out with Aunt Jamie too long. Small doses.

789
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:01,000
I'll just delete his fucking app. He doesn't know how to download it.

790
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:08,000
Alright. Yeah, that was the old school way. My mom would just march in and she'd be like, where's the light?

791
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
Where's the light? And she'd hit it until she found the power button.

792
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:16,000
Especially if it's like the switch or something like that. It's like, fuck that, it's my turn to play that shit.

793
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:24,000
I didn't do that crap all the time. My daddy, I want to play stuff on the TV. No, it's my time. You go away.

794
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:29,000
Alright, well apparently there's this Wi-Fi glitch going on with the Switch.

795
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:37,000
I haven't seen a lot of this. In my bedroom where I play the Switch, sometimes before bed, and in my living room where the TV is,

796
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:42,000
I get three bar signal on Switch, but I'm told some people have issues with the Switch.

797
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:47,000
The Switch will lose, or the Switch is having bad Wi-Fi signal in other parts of the house.

798
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:56,000
Like just in places where it shouldn't be getting bad signal. Like my phone has perfect signal right next to the freaking router,

799
00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:03,000
but my Nintendo Switch like loses Wi-Fi completely. So apparently there's some weird things going on with the Switch and Wi-Fi.

800
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:08,000
Now this is going around the internet. I don't know if y'all are experiencing this, but there's some sources out there.

801
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:14,000
Nintendo Life compiled a few of them that basically says that there are some frame rate drops happening on the Switch,

802
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:21,000
and this could be a flaw with the Wi-Fi feature. Apparently it's because of the auto-connect feature,

803
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:25,000
because if you go in and turn that feature off, you get a smoother frame rate.

804
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:33,000
So the rumor is that this auto-connecting that keeps trying to connect back to Wi-Fi is causing a frame rate performance issue in Breath of the Wild,

805
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:38,000
which I always assumed was just the game wasn't running as well at 900.

806
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:45,000
But I guess maybe people are seeing things like drop out where it was running smooth before.

807
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:49,000
I think that was pointed out by the developer Fast RMX.

808
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:50,000
Oh, interesting.

809
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:56,000
They realized that was the issue that they were getting. I thought maybe. Maybe I'm getting my stories confused.

810
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
Are they having problems with their online play or something?

811
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
No, I think they were having problems with their frame rate maybe.

812
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,000
Wow.

813
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:06,000
Maybe. I don't remember. I could be getting those two crossed, but I remember they made a comment about something.

814
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
I just assumed it was Zelda.

815
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
Maybe it could be Zelda.

816
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:17,000
Look at your friends list. It's like 19 of them are playing Zelda, and one of them is getting Binding of Isaac this week.

817
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
Very interesting.

818
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:25,000
So anyway, it does seem Nintendo is working on some type of firmware update for this,

819
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:33,000
but of course Nintendo is working on firmware updates anyway because the Switch OS is not totally done.

820
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:41,000
Again, we still don't know what the full online picture looks like, and we have a Splatoon test fire coming up next week.

821
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:45,000
So it's going to be an interesting weekend for the Switch.

822
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:48,000
I'd be curious if we get a big firmware update this weekend. We'll see.

823
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:51,000
I don't know. Anyway, moving on. Let's talk about something else.

824
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
Star Sakura, what do you got for us?

825
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:54,000
Sonic stuff.

826
00:51:54,000 --> 00:52:00,000
So basically, Project Sonic 2017 is now named Sonic Forces.

827
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:09,000
I don't know if it's going to be any better than some of the other more current Sonic 3D games, but who knows?

828
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:13,000
It also has a logo, which looks very military.

829
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:21,000
But in other Sonic news, Sega is actually going to be holding back Sonic Mania.

830
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:33,000
It was supposed to be in spring 2017, but now it's going to be in summer for Switch PC, PlayStation 4, Xbox One.

831
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:40,000
So it's supposed to be a classic Sonic take, so maybe it'll be good.

832
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:43,000
Yeah, but Sonic 4 was supposed to be a classic Sonic take too.

833
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:46,000
Well, Sonic 4 was kind of crap.

834
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:52,000
Some comments in our chat over at live.vog.net.com. Dungeon Busters saying the Sonic Forces footage looked interesting.

835
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:57,000
Dark Tetsuya says, the vibe I got from the preview footage was very Sonic adventure-esque.

836
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
Yeah, but Sonic Adventure 2 was kind of crap.

837
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
So hopefully in a good adventure kind of way.

838
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:05,000
Act Def says, yeah, both Sonic Mania and Forces look great.

839
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:12,000
Alex P. Carson says, I really, really want a good Sonic game. We're overdue for one. Sweet Jesus.

840
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:15,000
Well, Generations wasn't bad, right? I don't know.

841
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:16,000
Generations was pretty good.

842
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:22,000
Yeah, I was kind of into Generations. And I always cut the, oh, those aren't really Sonic games. Or are they?

843
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:25,000
The racing games. Are those SEGA racing? No, they're Sonic racing, right?

844
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:26,000
I think they're SEGA racing.

845
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:27,000
I thought it was Sonic and-

846
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
Sonic and SEGA racing.

847
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:34,000
Oh, that's what it was. Sonic and- Sonic, his shitty friends, and SEGA pals all go racing.

848
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:39,000
I like those games, I think, a little more than the rest of the internet.

849
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:45,000
No, that's- I'm sorry, no, it was Sonic and SEGA All-Stars Racing is what it was.

850
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:48,000
Okay, that's- is that what it-

851
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,000
Sonic is-

852
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:50,000
Well, there was two- there was also two of them.

853
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:54,000
Yes, there was All-Stars Racing and All-Stars Racing Transformed.

854
00:53:54,000 --> 00:54:02,000
Okay, that's it, that's it. So, looking in chat over at live.vognetwork.com, let's see, Act Def says Generations is one of the best.

855
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:07,000
Ice P in chat says, Alex P. Carson, try Sonic Utopia.

856
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
Oh, yeah, isn't that that fan one?

857
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:10,000
Yes.

858
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:14,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I never did get to try that, I wanted to, so, cool.

859
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:20,000
S200Matt says, I love Sonic and SEGA All-Stars Transformed, was amazing, I wish they would make more of that.

860
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:26,000
I kind of do, too. If nothing else, it's a reason to keep putting Ooh La La in games, so, you know, I'm all for that. Anyway.

861
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,000
Dark Soccer?

862
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
I want Space Michael to drive a car.

863
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:35,000
Are we at the point where that would be okay to do, or, you know, is this-

864
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:40,000
Oh, you wanna, okay, Complete Tangent, Theme Park Tangent, you ready for this? Okay.

865
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:44,000
So, guess what we learned about Star Tours?

866
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,000
What?

867
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:52,000
So, apparently, you know, you can ride that ride. If you've ridden the ride Star Tours before, you know there's several different configurations you can get.

868
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:56,000
And this is the new version that launched, what, about, god, it was almost five years ago at this point.

869
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
Still haven't been on it. Well, the original.

870
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:11,000
Okay, well, they have the new one, and so you get these different configurations where you might go to Hoth as the first planet, or you might go to, I keep wanting to say Terrain, like it's fucking Metroid.

871
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:15,000
I mean to say Tatooine. You can go to, like, these different planets, and then you get different closing planets.

872
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:24,000
But the middle segment is always a message from somebody, and the message can be from Admiral Ackbar, it can be from Princess Leia, it can be from Yoda,

873
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:29,000
or they just added recently BB-8, can also now deliver the message too in the middle.

874
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:36,000
But here's the thing, so Victoria, who's a dear friend of mine who I was going to see on this trip, she's like a Disney whore.

875
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:42,000
And I mean that in the best possible way. She actually dresses as the whore in Pirates of the Caribbean.

876
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:45,000
So I say that as a term of empowerment because she pulls it off great.

877
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
We wants the redhead.

878
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:51,000
Exactly. No, seriously, if you saw her dress, she's fucking amazing.

879
00:55:52,000 --> 00:56:02,000
So anyway, we did the ride, she says, every time I ride this, I always brace myself in this middle portion that Princess Leia's going to show up, and I'm just going to fucking lose it.

880
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:06,000
And I said, Victoria, and sure enough, we rode it, we got Ackbar, right?

881
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
She's like, God, I'm seeing Ackbar all the time lately.

882
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:13,000
So I said, Victoria, I bet you anything, they pulled Leia out.

883
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:20,000
Because if you're afraid that you're going to have a reaction, think about all these other people, like 20 and 30-somethings are going to be riding a fucking ride at Disneyland

884
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:23,000
and then losing their shit halfway through because Leia shows up.

885
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:28,000
And so what did we do? We asked a cast member. We said point blank, did you take Leia out of the rotation?

886
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:33,000
And they just quietly like look around to see if anybody else is there and then kind of whispered to us, yes, we did.

887
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:37,000
So you can't get Leia on Star Tours right now.

888
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,000
I'm glad I've seen her.

889
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:42,000
Yeah. And it's not that they won't ever bring her back.

890
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:50,000
But now to loop this back to what you were just saying, you have to answer that question of when now will it be okay to do that,

891
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:57,000
where people aren't going to have that, and I know this phrase is overused online, but it's what it is, that trigger response.

892
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:00,000
That's what it is. This whole thing we're talking about is a trigger response.

893
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:06,000
So when are we going to be far enough from that? Is it a year? Is it five years? I don't know.

894
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:13,000
So that's what I'm asking with Space Michael. Can we put Space Michael in the game or is that still going to be raw for some people?

895
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
I think it's been long enough myself.

896
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,000
Yeah, it's been long enough.

897
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:22,000
Anyway, so go into chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

898
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:25,000
Bobby Blackwell says they added that when Force Awakens came out.

899
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:29,000
Yeah, I hadn't been in three years though, or the BB-8 thing is what he's referring to.

900
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:35,000
I hadn't seen that in three years, so I was actually hoping to get the BB-8 and the new stuff.

901
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:39,000
But sadly, we got Hoth and Ackbar, although I think Hoth is the best first configuration.

902
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:42,000
The Hoth sequence is pretty fucking rad, I gotta say.

903
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
Now, did you do Soarin' Over the World?

904
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:48,000
We did do Soarin' Over the World. I'm glad you asked.

905
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:55,000
So they changed Soarin' Over California to Soarin' Over the World, which now instead of going over all these random-ass places in California,

906
00:57:55,000 --> 00:58:02,000
you go over famous landmarks like the Great Wall of China, the Taj Mahal, and these beautiful mountains and stuff.

907
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:06,000
So here's the thing. Yeah, I wrote it, and I walked off, I looked at Alan, and I said,

908
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:09,000
did that look fucking fake to you? Because the entire thing looked fake to me.

909
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:12,000
And Alan was kind of like, it was fake? He's like, the Taj Mahal looked really fake.

910
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:17,000
He said, but I think the rest of it was real. I'm like, oh no, that was all CGI.

911
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:23,000
That was all CGI. The animals, like the whales, he's like, well of course the animals were CGI,

912
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:26,000
but I'm like, no, it was all CGI. All of it.

913
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:33,000
So that's my only complaint with Soarin' is that it looks so good, because it's an HD movie now too,

914
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:38,000
but because it's HD, its fakeness is very apparent to me.

915
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:45,000
I almost wish for the film quality one back, but I think that one was really film,

916
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:50,000
except they probably added in the dude on the paraglider and the things that were in the old version of it,

917
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
but I think there was a lot that was legit.

918
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:55,000
They probably just like filmed it with a helicopter and took like, they also had like,

919
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:58,000
they capture the motion of it and everything so they can sink into it.

920
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:06,000
But I'm telling you, the Taj Mahal is the fucking fakest thing I've seen in a Disney ride in a long time.

921
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:12,000
It was like really obviously fake. But again, and then Alan perfectly summed it up in the way he always does.

922
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:17,000
He said, gosh Rob, it's almost as if they made that ride for kids or something.

923
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:20,000
And I was like, fine.

924
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:25,000
Yeah, but you know what? Okay, and then fine. Here's what they should do then instead.

925
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:32,000
Say fuck that's soaring over California, fuck soaring over the world, it should be fucking soaring with goddamn light planes.

926
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
Like fucking out of Tron, you know?

927
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:35,000
Yes.

928
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:36,000
That's what they should do.

929
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
Bring Tron back to Disney.

930
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:43,000
Alright, sorry. I know we got on a Disney tangent, but of course that happens here on the show.

931
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,000
I have to get to some of the comments in chat here.

932
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:49,000
S2100Matt says, Rob dropping the insider info.

933
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:54,000
Kaijuto saying, that person that spilled the beans on the Star Wars tour was thrown into a rancor pit after.

934
00:59:54,000 --> 01:00:00,000
I hope not. He was a nice guy to tell us that. Be very blunt with us for that.

935
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:06,000
BobbyBlackWolf says, there is literally nothing on the internet that says anything about Leia being removed.

936
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:09,000
I think we just broke a story. Time to go to Wikipedia. Really?

937
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:15,000
Well, she's... But then, okay, you know what's gonna happen? Bobby, I'm gonna tell you what's gonna happen.

938
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:23,000
The minute you go and post it that Leia's been removed, somebody's gonna reply, nuh-uh, I just saw her.

939
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:29,000
Or, I have a friend that was just to Disneyland that just saw her and you vog people are a bunch of fucking liars.

940
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:33,000
It's gonna be that whole Shazam effect.

941
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,000
Or no, is it Shazam or Kazam?

942
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:36,000
Kazam.

943
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
Which one's the fake movie? Okay, Kazam.

944
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:44,000
I don't even fucking know anymore. I don't even know anymore. There's so many alternative facts on the internet.

945
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
I don't even fucking know anymore what's real and what's not.

946
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:50,000
Shaquille O'Neal, real. Sinbad, fake.

947
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:56,000
They'll be like, drink bleach, you fat, miserable cunt, vog network. I just saw Leia.

948
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,000
I shouldn't be laughing.

949
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:06,000
But you did tie that together very well. That was a good callback.

950
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
What do we call that? That was a good callback. Alright.

951
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:11,000
Anyway.

952
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,000
Hey, Dark Sakura.

953
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,000
How you doing over there?

954
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:25,000
Are you ready to go on Soarin' Over the World? Would you be okay if Soarin' Over the World just looked like total CGI?

955
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:26,000
No.

956
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:27,000
No?

957
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:28,000
I don't wanna go on it, actually.

958
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
Because you trust my opinion?

959
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:35,000
Not just that. I think the Soarin' Over the World thing was dumb. I would prefer Soarin' Over California.

960
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,000
Yeah, and now it no longer smells like oranges.

961
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:40,000
Yeah, but the place didn't actually smell like oranges to begin with.

962
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:45,000
When you fly over Fiji, it does, like, that's the only part of the ride that smelled to me was Fiji.

963
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:51,000
In a pleasant way, it smelled, before you guys think I'm making a joke here, that Fiji smelled like the beach.

964
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:58,000
And I was like, oh, that's nice. But that was the only part of the whole ride that I actually caught a smell with, was the Fiji part. So.

965
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:04,000
Soarin' Over California used to just give me, like, bad vertigo when you go over the mountain.

966
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:08,000
And so I just, I don't even think that I wanna watch the fakeness.

967
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:12,000
They didn't have you soar over, like, the middle of, like, China and just, like...

968
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:13,000
No, the Great Wall. You did the Great Wall.

969
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:17,000
No, just, like, spraying, like, a bunch of smog or whatever.

970
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:20,000
No, it wasn't that part of China. It was the beautiful Great Wall.

971
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:26,000
But I will say this. The one thing they knew not to change, and they didn't, was the beautiful music they used on Soarin'.

972
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:35,000
They did not really change the music except, okay, when you go through China, then the music gets all, like, starts being on a mandarin, right?

973
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:36,000
And all that stuff. When you go to the...

974
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:37,000
A mandarin?

975
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:38,000
Or what? What? What?

976
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:39,000
Mandolin.

977
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:40,000
Thank you. A mandolin.

978
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:41,000
A mandarin is an orange.

979
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:46,000
You know what? I've just been driving for five hours, so I don't wanna hear it.

980
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:50,000
Let's go squish, squish, squish, squish. Squish, squish, squish, squish.

981
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:55,000
I'm just missing that orange smell on Soarin', okay? Faken' leave me alone.

982
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:57,000
Soarin' was the ride I'd go on when my feet hurt.

983
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:03,000
And then, then the Taj Mahal got very, like, you know, like, total cultural appropriation, but...

984
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:06,000
So it was then played on, like, a sitar or something?

985
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
So it's like the, it's a small world after all.

986
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:14,000
Yes. It's, it's like the Disney version where it's like, ah, you let him get away with it because it's Disney and it's cute, you know?

987
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:21,000
Well, the best part about Soarin', though, is the intro done by the tick. Or the guy who played the tick.

988
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,000
And he's still, he's still there. Patrick Warburton is still there.

989
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:24,000
I love him.

990
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:27,000
They, they, they actually, they recycled the same fuckin' thing.

991
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:28,000
Yeah.

992
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:29,000
And it works. So...

993
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:32,000
We're gonna be soarin' over at the world today.

994
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:39,000
Alright, now everybody in chat is giving me shit. Bobby Blackwolf is like, the Mandarin was a Marvel villain.

995
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,000
MXC says, music on a Mandarin, lol.

996
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:47,000
ComeOnNoga says, problematic, lol. You know what?

997
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:52,000
They make that joke actually in the Lego Marvel cartoon where they all, who's on the phone?

998
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:56,000
Oh, the Mandarin. Ooh, I'll get my juicer. No, not that Mandarin.

999
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:03,000
And Dungeon Buster says, aw, looks like they replaced the Captain EO return with a Pixar short film festival feature now.

1000
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:10,000
Actually, that would have been cool. A Pixar, I mean, Captain EO will forever live on in my heart, but a Pixar short film festival would have been awesome.

1001
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:16,000
Disneyland has another fuckin' Star Wars thing in the theater. I mean, don't get me wrong. I love Star Wars.

1002
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:26,000
But, Space Mountain right now. Star Wars. Star Tours. Star Wars. The old Eothear. Star Wars. Like, it's just, innovations turn into Star Wars.

1003
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
Matterhorn. Star Wars.

1004
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:31,000
It's being refurbished right now, so be careful what you wish for.

1005
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
Alright, we need to get back to video games.

1006
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:38,000
O.M.G., this 30 minute tangent on Disney. Loki, what do you have next for us?

1007
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:50,000
So, Injustice 2 is going to be coming out with an unlock system using source crystals, which are basically in-game currency that you have to buy.

1008
01:04:50,000 --> 01:05:01,000
It's meant to be used for purchasing outfits or gear colors, but you can also use it to level up your characters as well.

1009
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:10,000
So, for example, after you've leveled the character to the max level of 20, you can use source crystals to take another character of your choosing up to level 20 as well.

1010
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:15,000
But, that can only be done if you have one level at 20. One character at 20.

1011
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:29,000
So, apparently, they're saying that it's not going to be used for pay-to-win, but, yeah, I mean, you are technically speeding up the process of leveling up different characters.

1012
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:40,000
And it's only for, you know, costumes, but different colors for outfits, different costumes.

1013
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:49,000
Wasn't that a fucking staple in fighting games? Just fucking pallet swaps? Because I'm looking at this fucking picture of Harley Quinn here, and that's a fucking pallet swap.

1014
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:52,000
I mean, that is a goddamn pallet swap right there.

1015
01:05:53,000 --> 01:06:05,000
She has a green and blue costume, or a pink and blue costume, or a black and red costume. It's a pallet swap. And you're charging money for that.

1016
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:12,000
Well, if it's minimal in-game currency that you can earn anyway to get said pallet swap, then, okay, that's a little more in line with the Christmas shit.

1017
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:16,000
No, I don't think you can actually earn this. You have to buy this. This is with real money.

1018
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
What? No. Oh my god, that sucks.

1019
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:23,000
Because they have another type of in-game currency, or another type of credits that you get for the actual gear.

1020
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:38,000
So they have, like, stuff that you purchase new gear and stuff like that. But I don't think the source crystals you can actually use, I don't believe that you can actually use, like, you can't earn them in-game.

1021
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:45,000
Wow. So, I mean, I'm gonna take a look and get some more information here to see.

1022
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:54,000
So, their official announcement is source crystals can be purchased with real money, but aren't required to progress or advance in the game.

1023
01:06:54,000 --> 01:07:00,000
Can't be used to purchase gear or an advantage in gameplay. Doesn't say they can be earned in-game.

1024
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:09,000
Source crystals can only be used to purchase cosmetic items and various shaders for different character costumes.

1025
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:14,000
Yeah, literally purchasing skins and shaders. I mean, that's...

1026
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:23,000
Yep, I hear ya. Back in the old Street Fighter II days, it was, you know, press the start button to get the pallet swap instead of one of the other buttons.

1027
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:26,000
Like, I get it.

1028
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:32,000
It says, do I have to pay for source crystals? Yes, real money is used to purchase source crystals.

1029
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:41,000
That is fucking stupid. I just, I know, like, people are, like, gung-ho with, like, Overwatch and everything like that with, you know, loot crates and stuff like that.

1030
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:50,000
Please, please, please, people that buy this game, don't support this kind of crap. Because this is ridiculous. It's only gonna get worse.

1031
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:56,000
Alright. Well, let's move on. Let's talk about an emulator story.

1032
01:07:56,000 --> 01:08:05,000
So, you know, emulators, they're this grey legal area. I think all these game companies are aware that people use them.

1033
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:11,000
And Nintendo probably is the only one that really goes after people like crazy for the emulator stuff.

1034
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:16,000
At least, not like individuals who use them, but sites that create them and host them and so forth.

1035
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:22,000
But this puts an interesting little wrinkle in that whole thing, because there's this Wii emulator out there called Dolphin.

1036
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:28,000
Now, I've never used Dolphin, but maybe some of you have. Have you? Is it a good emulator?

1037
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:32,000
Yeah, it's good. It does GameCube and Wii emulation.

1038
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:35,000
Okay, I always thought, yeah, I remember hearing Dolphin back when it was a GameCube emulator.

1039
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:39,000
I don't know if it does Wii U as well, but I know it does Wii and GameCube.

1040
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:54,000
Well, here's the thing. The newest version of Dolphin apparently will emulate Nintendo's console to a point where you can actually use the Wii Shop Channel and actually use it to make purchases through your emulated Wii.

1041
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:59,000
So you can, which yes, the Wii Shop Channel is still open. I know a lot of stuff on Nintendo's service closed.

1042
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:03,000
But of course Nintendo is gonna keep the thing open the longest where they can take money from you.

1043
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:06,000
So you can actually go onto the Wii Shop Channel, buy games.

1044
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:12,000
Shit, you can get an emulator in an emulator. Go buy a virtual console title on the Wii in an emulator.

1045
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:15,000
And yo, dawg, I heard you like emulators. So here it is.

1046
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:19,000
So you can do that now. That's, uh, wow, that's very interesting.

1047
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:31,000
Something else that is worth noting about Dolphin, you know, as much as Nintendo may not like the whole emulator thing, Dolphin does upscale Wii games into HD resolutions.

1048
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:37,000
The original Wii was locked to 480p. So you can play things like Super Mario Galaxies and you can play Chronicles.

1049
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:46,000
You can do this in HD through Dolphin. Dolphin will also allow you to export data to an SD card just like a regular Wii does.

1050
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:52,000
So does that mean I can play something on the emulator, export it to my card, then take it to a real Wii and play?

1051
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,000
I mean, it seems like that's a given at this point.

1052
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:58,000
I don't know if you would be able to do that, but I could see maybe game saves?

1053
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
Yeah.

1054
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:05,000
So you could play, like, your game saves on there and then, I mean, that's pretty, pretty awesome.

1055
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:09,000
I don't know why they don't do that anyways for just, like, different systems.

1056
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:15,000
Like, imagine, like, the PSP and you could just have, like, an emulated version of the PSP, download the PSP app.

1057
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:18,000
It's like you have the console and you buy digitally.

1058
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:23,000
Uh, Brad from Pod Culture and Chat says, uh, wasn't Dolphin the name for a console, codename for a console?

1059
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:24,000
GameCube.

1060
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:32,000
And that was answered by Bobby Blackwolf in our chat, who also pointed out that I actually, apparently me, I have used Dolphin and I didn't even realize it.

1061
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:38,000
That was the emulator that was running the F-Zero GX game that I tried in the Oculus Rift.

1062
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:42,000
That apparently was a version of the Dolphin emulator but running on the Oculus Rift, so I didn't realize that.

1063
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,000
So, okay, I have used Dolphin.

1064
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:50,000
I bet Dolphin will run pretty well on your PC, get some F-Zero GX going on there, all HD and shit.

1065
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:53,000
Yeah, that's tempting. That's super tempting.

1066
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:58,000
I mean, here's the question I ask you guys.

1067
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:04,000
Is it ethical? I'm not gonna ask is it legal, because the answer would be no, at least according to Nintendo.

1068
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:11,000
Would it be ethical for me to use an emulator when I purchase the system and I purchase the game?

1069
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:15,000
Is it ethical for me to use the emulator then to upgrade the game?

1070
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:16,000
I think it would be.

1071
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:19,000
Because, if I'm not mistaken, Dolphin runs off those disks, right?

1072
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:20,000
Because you could pitch it.

1073
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:29,000
I used an ISO for, the one I did mine for last time was the practice, because we had that Smash tournament for the little rotation thing that I did.

1074
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:34,000
So I played Smash Brothers Melee using that, just to kind of play it a little bit.

1075
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:38,000
And my laptop, it ran like shit, you know, it was okay.

1076
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:47,000
Well, I wouldn't try to put those tiny disks in a laptop drive, but like DVD drives still had like the whole 3-inch disk instead of the inset.

1077
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:53,000
I don't think that they would read those, because they're technically not DVD format, or they're not supposed to be DVD format.

1078
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:59,000
They're supposed to be something different, but I think it does read the ISOs, but I mean, fuck, who cares?

1079
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:01,000
I mean, granted, Nintendo would say it's illegal.

1080
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:04,000
Oh, fuck what they care, I don't care.

1081
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:09,000
But you have the game, you have the system, who gives a shit?

1082
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:16,000
Yeah, and that's kind of where I'm at, where it's like, okay, well, I bought the system, I bought the game, so it's like Nintendo didn't lose any money here.

1083
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:27,000
It's just that now I'm choosing to take said game and apply some filters to it to play it a little, maybe in a different way than the publisher intended, which is where Nintendo would say the problem is.

1084
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:36,000
Well then that's their fucking fault, because you know what, they could be doing this shit with their consoles, where it's up-rezzing this stuff and looking nice, but they just refuse to do it.

1085
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:51,000
So that comes down to the whole, why was Napster fucking popular or these online sharing sites for MP3s, because it was easier to get the MP3s through those sites than it was to buy them from the actual makers of the music.

1086
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:55,000
So when it becomes easier to purchase it legit, then it will be.

1087
01:12:55,000 --> 01:13:04,000
Like imagine, say the Switch or something like that, let's just pretend that the Switch actually is powerful enough to run these games in HD, then imagine you could purchase them.

1088
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:15,000
Like, okay, hey, we've got this back calendar, f0gx, okay, you can play it now in 1080p, 60 frames per second, it looks fantastic, it runs great, and you can do it with your Switch console.

1089
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:23,000
Yeah, people will be dropping money for that shit like crazy, but no, Nintendo doesn't do that, because I don't know why.

1090
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:28,000
Alright, I'm just looking at some of the comments in chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

1091
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:36,000
Let's see, S2100Matt says, I wish the GameCube was named Dolphin. Yeah, well, the Wii was codenamed Revolution, remember that?

1092
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:40,000
And it was like, god, that name was so much better for a lot of people, but they kind of made Wii work, though.

1093
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:48,000
Anyway, Dungeon Buster says, if I own the game in the system, using an emulator and play them on another system seems fine, if not a bit grey to me.

1094
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:53,000
Stoppy says, what if you own the game but not the console? Is it okay to play the game on your PC?

1095
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:59,000
That's even more of a grey area. I think some would argue yes, because the game is what you purchased and you bought the software.

1096
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:03,000
Technically they don't make anything off the console anyways, they may actually lose money, so...

1097
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:05,000
Well, that's another issue.

1098
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:07,000
In a sense, you're doing them a favor.

1099
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:16,000
I would say it's one of the, it's a different shade of grey. I'm not saying there's 50 shades of grey, but there's a few shades of grey, and that's a little darker grey.

1100
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:22,000
I'm surprised that they don't try to come out with something official to do this shit for older consoles.

1101
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:28,000
Like, Wii consoles, why wouldn't you want to have more platforms for your games to be on?

1102
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:34,000
Why wouldn't you want, like, this shop is open, you're literally putting out a program that you can go downslope stuff legit.

1103
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:38,000
What's the problem there? I don't understand why you would have a problem with that.

1104
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:47,000
Alright. Well, I have to say, ethical or not, especially now that you bring up this F-Zero thing, I'm like, I kind of want to check this out after the show.

1105
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:57,000
And I own a GameCube, I've bought every system Nintendo's ever made, and I have a legit copy of F-Zero GX, so I feel like I should be able to do this.

1106
01:14:57,000 --> 01:15:02,000
Well, think about the virtual console games that you've bought over and over and over again, and then you probably own the original at some point.

1107
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:03,000
Yes.

1108
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:06,000
I mean, it's like, how many times have you paid Nintendo for the same product over and over?

1109
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:10,000
I know, right? Like, you all love to give me shit over this Mass Effect 3 thing.

1110
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:15,000
You all love to give me shit about how many times I've bought Mass Effect 3 and on what platforms.

1111
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:18,000
Ask me how many times I've bought Super Mario Bros. 3.

1112
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:24,000
The original NES version, right? The Super Nintendo remake and Lost Levels.

1113
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:29,000
The Wii Virtual Console. I think I have it on 3DS Virtual Console, I think.

1114
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:38,000
The Wii U Virtual Console. Oh, Super Mario Bros. Advance 4, also on Wii U, I have that too.

1115
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:48,000
Exactly. So you spend that kind of money, you've bought that game dozens of times over, and they're gonna still call you a thief and a terrible person for downloading something.

1116
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:58,000
Fuck them. Fuck you, Nintendo. Fuck you. I will download it and I will play wherever the fuck I want and go fuck yourselves.

1117
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,000
Calm down. Calm down. Alright.

1118
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:07,000
Let's see. Alex B. Carson in chat says, download a ROM and tweak the fuck out of it, Rob. You own it.

1119
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:11,000
I wouldn't know what to do except change the sprites to dicks.

1120
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:14,000
And that's what everybody did when ROM hacking first came out.

1121
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:17,000
You had Super Penis Brothers, The Legend of Penis.

1122
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:22,000
All the particles in, like, F-Zero, the dicks, just dicks flying into the creek.

1123
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:28,000
Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, how do you really feel, Loki? I really wish you wouldn't censor yourself.

1124
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,000
I know, I'm sorry.

1125
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:34,000
And Stoppy gives you a nice hardy. You go, girl.

1126
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:38,000
Alright. Dark Sock, right?

1127
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:41,000
I'm sorry, just interrupt real quick.

1128
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:43,000
I'm sorry, I'm used to men interrupting me.

1129
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:45,000
Hey now. Hey now.

1130
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:54,000
It's just like, you know, this even coming off of, like, Nintendo wanting a portion of your YouTube video profit

1131
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:59,000
because they feel that they deserve that. Fuck them. I mean, seriously, fuck them.

1132
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:04,000
I'm reaching for my volume down lever right now for Loki.

1133
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:08,000
And I apologize if your eardrums got blown out a minute ago.

1134
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:11,000
So how about something about Capcom?

1135
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:12,000
How about you go, girl?

1136
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:21,000
Of course. They are reproducing the Disney Afternoon with the Disney Afternoon collection. Yay!

1137
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:30,000
We are going to be getting Chippendales Rescue Rangers 1 and 2, Darkwing Duck, you know, the terror that flaps in the night,

1138
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:37,000
DuckTales, DuckTales 2, and TailSpin in one big collection for 20 bucks.

1139
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:41,000
And it comes out the day before my birthday. Someone buy it for me.

1140
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:43,000
All because of Darkwing Duck, really.

1141
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:45,000
But all those games are awesome.

1142
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:52,000
Yeah, but 20 bucks for the whole thing. It's going to be on Xbox, on Xbone, PlayStation 4, and PC.

1143
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:56,000
That's great. So, okay, there's a couple weird things about this, though.

1144
01:17:57,000 --> 01:18:02,000
Well, one, this isn't a weird thing, but this is totally the sequel to the Mega Man collection, in a weird way.

1145
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:08,000
Like, I think we have the Mega Man Legacy collection to thank for this. Some of the same people are involved, right?

1146
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:13,000
I think some of the people we were talking about last week are involved with this as well. So that's kind of neat.

1147
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:22,000
But the other thing that's really weird to me about this, okay, all those games in this collection, if I'm not mistaken, are NES games, right?

1148
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:26,000
We don't have any Genesis games in there, right? They're all NES original games, right?

1149
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:29,000
Yet, the Nintendo platform is the one that's missing.

1150
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:31,000
Yeah.

1151
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:33,000
So that part's a little weird to me. I mean, don't get me wrong.

1152
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:41,000
Also, these screens, though, it looks like they've got them on smaller screens within the screen, which, I mean, maybe it's for the aspect ratio.

1153
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:51,000
But it just seems kind of ridiculous to me. Like, I have no idea. It just seemed pointless.

1154
01:18:51,000 --> 01:19:06,000
I guess it's the same thing that happened with, oh, what was that game? Was it Mega Man X3 on Saturn had that kind of window around it? So I think it's kind of dumb.

1155
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:13,000
Well, with a lot of the classic games that come out, like, now for the HD borders and stuff, they draw those borders.

1156
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:19,000
I think, I'm pretty sure Mega Man Legacy had something like that as well. But you can also, you can futz with the aspect ratio.

1157
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:28,000
It may not be locked to that. That might just be something they're using for the screenshots, Jamie, but sometimes with those games, you can, like, turn it off and play it at, like, original ratio or zoomed.

1158
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:31,000
Those games usually give you control. I know Mega Man Legacy did.

1159
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:36,000
And no bonkers or, uh, you know, goof troop game?

1160
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:39,000
Still not good enough for you, unlucky.

1161
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:44,000
Well, they're both Capcom games. They're both Super Nintendo games, so maybe that's the issue.

1162
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:55,000
Maybe the sequel, maybe the sequel. I just, I kind of wish this collection was on the Switch. I'm like, now I'm turning into that guy where it's like, okay, I would like to be able to play this game on my TV or on the go.

1163
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:57,000
Yeah, I'll tell you why.

1164
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:58,000
I already know why, Loki.

1165
01:19:58,000 --> 01:19:59,000
You know why?

1166
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:03,000
Because the same reason I bought Super Mario Brothers 3 17 times.

1167
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:07,000
Because they're gonna, they potentially could release it on virtual consoles?

1168
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:08,000
Individually, yes.

1169
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:09,000
Yep, I know.

1170
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:10,000
Because Nintendo are fucking greedy bastards.

1171
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:14,000
However, however, however, wasn't Mega Man Legacy on Wii U? Am I wrong?

1172
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:20,000
I may not, I honestly don't know because I didn't buy it on Wii U. I know the DuckTales remake was on Wii U.

1173
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:25,000
But that was also, I believe, way forward that did that and not Digital Eclipse.

1174
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:27,000
Did somebody in chat know? Was the Mega Man collection on Wii U?

1175
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:31,000
I think it may have been. The only thing is that they would have had...

1176
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:34,000
Okay, they are saying no. Alright, I'm wrong there.

1177
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:35,000
Oh.

1178
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:39,000
So I was confusing it because of the fact that DuckTales was on Wii U, but that was a different company that made it.

1179
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:43,000
Because you would be devaluing their platform, Rob, with their virtual...

1180
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:50,000
No, I'm serious. I know, I say this like, very like, ridiculously, but that is how they think.

1181
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:55,000
They literally think that. That it would devalue their platform.

1182
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:58,000
That's why fucking Animal Crossing doesn't have NES ROMs in it anymore.

1183
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:02,000
I feel devalued on a regular basis sometimes.

1184
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:06,000
And Nintendo, it's the horrible relationship we have with them.

1185
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:11,000
Alright, give somebody else a try, Loki. Stop picking on Nintendo. Let's talk about somebody else.

1186
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:15,000
Fine, fine. I'll talk about Sony.

1187
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:25,000
So, Sony has, and this is, I equally love this service as much as some of the other Nintendo things I've been ragging on just now.

1188
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:29,000
But PlayStation Now has got PlayStation 4 games coming to it.

1189
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:31,000
Hooray!

1190
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:34,000
So yeah, they're going to be adding those to it, and...

1191
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,000
Can't wait to play Knack.

1192
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,000
Yes, so...

1193
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,000
I'm sure that, are those the games that are coming out for it?

1194
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:47,000
It's not going to be Horizon Zero Dawn and the new shit. It's going to be the first wave of PlayStation 4 games, right?

1195
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:52,000
I don't know that you really say what games are going to be coming out for.

1196
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:56,000
But this is going to be starting, I guess, this year.

1197
01:21:56,000 --> 01:22:02,000
Now, the reason for that as well is because they're dropping PlayStation 3 and Vita support from PlayStation Now.

1198
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:08,000
So you can't play those systems on the Vita or PS3.

1199
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,000
But...

1200
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:15,000
Yeah, so right now they've got 483 PlayStation 3 games on the service.

1201
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:19,000
And they're saying that they're going to be adding PlayStation 4 games to it as well.

1202
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:21,000
You know what would be neat?

1203
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:29,000
I'm not going to expect that this is going to happen, but maybe Sony can give this one a little thought as to something they could sweeten the pot with at the E3 conference.

1204
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:38,000
What if I already bought a game digitally, and so instead of having to have that game take up space on my hard drive,

1205
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:42,000
because it's on my account, I can play it through PlayStation Now.

1206
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,000
And now I'm not taking up space on my hard drive.

1207
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:49,000
Granted, I'd be using my bandwidth through my cable provider, but at least I can make the choice.

1208
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:54,000
Do I want to clear space on my hard drive to install this game, or do I want to play through PlayStation Now,

1209
01:22:54,000 --> 01:23:02,000
maybe this huge backlog of games I've bought with the PlayStation Plus service, and stream those instead?

1210
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,000
Wouldn't that be kind of cool?

1211
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,000
Yeah, that would be something.

1212
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:11,000
And then same with all those PlayStation 2 games I bought on the PlayStation 3 or PlayStation 3 games I bought.

1213
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:13,000
I wouldn't want to devalue the platform.

1214
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:15,000
You wouldn't want to devalue the platform.

1215
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:24,000
So the powerful PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 4 Pro are so powerful that they're unable to emulate PlayStation 1 or PlayStation 2 games.

1216
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,000
This is just a broken record at this point.

1217
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:33,000
Can Sony please just come out at E3 and say, okay, done. PlayStation 1 and PlayStation 4, done.

1218
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:36,000
The PSP could fucking do that shit. I mean, come on.

1219
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:44,000
You all have talked about how you want to buy a PS4 Pro, spend $400 on it so you can play PlayStation 1 games.

1220
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,000
Fine. Here you go. Click.

1221
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:47,000
I mean, seriously.

1222
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:51,000
There's a tiny little button on the stage that they push. There you go. It's done.

1223
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:55,000
They are getting their asses kicked by Microsoft when it comes to backwards compatibility,

1224
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:59,000
because on top of that, like the backwards compatible games on Microsoft, I can play those on PC,

1225
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:03,000
which begs the question, because I would have this conversation with a GameStop employee,

1226
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:06,000
why would I want to buy an Xbox One at this point?

1227
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:10,000
Because I can just get a PC and fucking have an Xbox One, basically.

1228
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:17,000
Well, and interesting in that whole space as well, we were talking last week about PlayStation Now's competitor,

1229
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:22,000
now with Microsoft, and the fact that in that program, you will be able to just download the games.

1230
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:29,000
Exactly. Come on. Come the fuck on. You guys are getting your asses beat. It's so pathetic at this point.

1231
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:31,000
And then the other thing was that...

1232
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:36,000
But, Loki, to be fair, when it comes to the sales, and that's what really counts, Loki, they're not.

1233
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:41,000
I mean, we can look at it with the critic eye, but at the end of the day,

1234
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:45,000
and how did this point never come up in the beginning, opening moments of our show?

1235
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:47,000
Then allow me to make it now.

1236
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:51,000
At the end of the day, it doesn't fucking matter what any reviewer says.

1237
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:54,000
It doesn't matter what you say. It doesn't matter what your friend on Twitter says.

1238
01:24:54,000 --> 01:25:02,000
None of it fucking matters. What does matter? Sales. 100%. That's what's important.

1239
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:06,000
Will the game sell or not? That's why pre-orders are vicious.

1240
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:13,000
Especially, you know, getting the pre-orders in before the embargo is lifted on games that might end up being stinkers and so forth.

1241
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:15,000
So, at the end of the day, it's fucking sales.

1242
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:22,000
So, that's what I'm saying, Loki, is that you could say, like, oh, well, Microsoft is dancing circles around Sony,

1243
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:26,000
and I don't disagree with you, but at the end of the day, it doesn't fucking matter. You know why?

1244
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:30,000
Because PlayStation 4 is dancing circles around Microsoft when it comes to hardware.

1245
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:36,000
Because they have good first-party exclusives because they're making stuff in-house and they're making deals to get those titles,

1246
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:39,000
which, you know, more power to them because they're great titles.

1247
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:46,000
I wish Crackdown would come out, but, you know, that may be 2018 next time I hear about it.

1248
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:49,000
I have a good feeling it'll be this year.

1249
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:56,000
One thing I was also going to mention, in Japan, they are finally anti-production of the PlayStation 3 after 11 years.

1250
01:25:56,000 --> 01:26:01,000
So, that's going to be ending very soon.

1251
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:08,000
I have to admit, this is kind of one of those Zsa Zsa Gabor was still alive pieces of news.

1252
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:14,000
Like, you know, with all respect, when Zsa Zsa Gabor passed away, a lot of people were like, she was still alive.

1253
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:19,000
So, that's kind of how I feel about the PlayStation 3 ending production.

1254
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:20,000
Like, oh, that didn't already happen?

1255
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:24,000
I still have my launch George Foreman, man. That thing is still running.

1256
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:29,000
PlayStation 3 ended up being a great system. Didn't start as one, but it ended up being a great system.

1257
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:32,000
So, I mean, it's sad to see it's day, but...

1258
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:35,000
I didn't pay for it, so it's fine.

1259
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:37,000
Alright.

1260
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:41,000
I'd like a new Resistance game, though. I would like a new Resistance game.

1261
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:45,000
Well, maybe somebody out there will hear your prayers.

1262
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:51,000
Well, I know that finally I got my prayers heard and there's going to be a new Mass Effect game and I hope it's good.

1263
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:55,000
I hope it's good, but this stuff gives me hope because this stuff sounds kind of neat.

1264
01:26:55,000 --> 01:27:02,000
Mass Effect Archives, it's a website that is coming and it will allow you to put your Mass Effect character where?

1265
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:04,000
In the cloud!

1266
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:05,000
That's right.

1267
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:10,000
You can launch them into the actual space, the cloud of the internet.

1268
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:16,000
This is something that folks with early access to Mass Effect Andromeda and the EA thing have noticed.

1269
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,000
There's this thing called the Mass Effect Archives.

1270
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:24,000
And so what you can do in the game, Character Creator, you can upload your character data or import it through Mass Effect Archives.

1271
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:28,000
Is this for sick people like me who want to bring in their character from one platform to another?

1272
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:29,000
It might be.

1273
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:34,000
Anyway, you do need an internet connection to use the feature and that's about all we know yet,

1274
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:40,000
but I'm sure we'll know a little more when Mass Effect Andromeda officially releases on Tuesday.

1275
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:47,000
But in the meantime, you know what, while you wait for Mass Effect Andromeda and all these newfangled games,

1276
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:51,000
you could take five minutes out of your damn day to appreciate a classic.

1277
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:57,000
And that's what Dark Sakura does for a few minutes here on every week of Orange Lounge Radio.

1278
01:27:57,000 --> 01:28:00,000
She's going to dive into the gaming vault and find a game that she thinks,

1279
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:04,000
hey, this game, wait, not you, you're Halo.

1280
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:09,000
This game is a classic and you should be paying it a little bit of respect.

1281
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:14,000
So Dark Sakura, what is the classic game of the week?

1282
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:16,000
This is an unexpected pick from you, Dark Sakura.

1283
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:22,000
Yeah, it's and it's a game that I had remembered playing right when it came out on Sega CD.

1284
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:29,000
So it's Microcosm, which maybe not the best game, but it certainly was one of the early ones of its type.

1285
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:31,000
It is a 3D rail shooter.

1286
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:35,000
It was published by Psygnosis in 1993.

1287
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:40,000
And one of the reasons I mentioned this because it was actually developed for the FM Towns,

1288
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:42,000
which I brought up as a classic console.

1289
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:50,000
It had been ported to Sega CD, Amiga CD32 and the 3DO consoles and MS-DOS.

1290
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:57,000
So this one, the only real, I would say more widespread knowledge that people would have of it,

1291
01:28:57,000 --> 01:29:00,000
would quite likely be from the Sega CD.

1292
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:05,000
It had it had full motion video animation backgrounds.

1293
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:10,000
The rendering of such were done by Silicon Graphics.

1294
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:14,000
And depending on where you're playing, it's either first person or third person.

1295
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:25,000
So basically, you were playing inside of a body of a company presence is like set way in the future or something.

1296
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:33,000
So you basically are having like what is the Fantastic Voyage or whatever it was in a body fighting off

1297
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:42,000
different little nano droids that are trying to control this president guy and take over everything.

1298
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:46,000
So the demo for this game came out in 1991.

1299
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:53,000
It was for the Amiga CD TV and they had a port for the CD I cancel planned and then was canceled.

1300
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:55,000
There is a prototype out there.

1301
01:29:55,000 --> 01:30:04,000
So then it was funded by Fujitsu to make it a launch title for the FM Towns Marty.

1302
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:18,000
It was then released later on on other systems and it had a soundtrack done by Rick Wakeman and another version done by Tim Wright.

1303
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:21,000
It had to do with licensing.

1304
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:28,000
Looking up Rick Wakeman, he was a pretty much a prog rock guy.

1305
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:35,000
So you can imagine the soundtrack microcosm really did get some very,

1306
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:40,000
very high ratings for graphics, but not so necessarily great for gameplay.

1307
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:43,000
It was really simplistic, to be honest.

1308
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:47,000
I mean, for 1993, this game looks fucking great.

1309
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:50,000
Yeah. For 1993, the game was amazing looking.

1310
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:52,000
Now you look at it and you're like, oh, OK.

1311
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:56,000
But you know, this this comes from a very particular era of gaming.

1312
01:30:56,000 --> 01:31:00,000
It does. Especially when we talk about computing like the Amiga and stuff.

1313
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:03,000
And the really the big thing about it is that, like I said,

1314
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:14,000
while it wasn't the greatest game of all time forever, it was notable that it was it was very.

1315
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:18,000
What's the word I'm thinking of? It was a sign of its time.

1316
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:28,000
It really displayed where people imagined games going with the full motion video, with the high end animation for its time.

1317
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:33,000
And we had there were quite a few other games like that that came out like.

1318
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:38,000
What's another one? Philosoma. Do you remember that one? I don't.

1319
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:43,000
In fact, that was almost a classic game. But I brought up microcosm because I was trying to think of a game which was in.

1320
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:48,000
Which means spoiler alert in a future week. I'm teasing.

1321
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:56,000
Well, no, but hold on. I'm going to find something real quick about Philosoma, because it was.

1322
01:31:56,000 --> 01:32:02,000
It was originally what I was going to do. So, yeah, Philosoma was done in 1995.

1323
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:08,000
It was for PlayStation. And the thing about it is that it was for a shooter.

1324
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:15,000
It switched various directions, different points of view from it, really good music, too.

1325
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:23,000
But it was more or less a in the same vein as Microcosm.

1326
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:29,000
I would like to say that Microcosm was a precursor to this.

1327
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:35,000
Of course, the sequel for Philosoma was Face Paradox, but I'll go into that if I ever do this game again.

1328
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:45,000
But it was just really that mid early early to mid 90s kind of game where they wanted it to look a lot more.

1329
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:49,000
It wanted it to be more immersive and have so much more going on.

1330
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:53,000
And the technology, the time lent itself very well to doing it as full motion.

1331
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:59,000
Like what were the other games of that era? Like Sewer Shark, for example, kind of along the same lines.

1332
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:03,000
So more like Night Trap you did last week in a different in a different kind of way.

1333
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:07,000
But it wasn't the game overlay on top of full motion.

1334
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:09,000
I guess that's true. I guess that's true.

1335
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:14,000
So I would say, but, you know, on its own, there were limited editions of this that came out.

1336
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:24,000
The PC one and the Omega CD 32 came with the game, the manual, a soundtrack and a T-shirt.

1337
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:27,000
So that's it. It's Microcosm.

1338
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:30,000
Right. There it is, your classic of the week, Microcosm.

1339
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:36,000
And we're looking at it in studio here on the Amiga, which is a system that doesn't get enough love here on O.L.R.

1340
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:40,000
But it was on like a million systems in that era.

1341
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:46,000
And it wasn't I would say that many. They were just more niche systems at the time.

1342
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:48,000
Yeah. Yeah.

1343
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:52,000
The Sega CD was probably the better accessible of them.

1344
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:57,000
But there I mean, again, it was the FM Towns. They had a version set for the Marty.

1345
01:33:57,000 --> 01:34:03,000
The Amiga systems weren't that well spread around. And the 3DO. I mean, did you know anyone who had a 3DO?

1346
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:09,000
JCPenney in the display. Did they ever sell a gaming system? Why did I name them?

1347
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:14,000
I associated it with the mall. I think I meant to say Sears. Sears would have one in the display.

1348
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:17,000
Montgomery Ward. Montgomery Ward. That's where I got my killer instinct.

1349
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:25,000
I had 3DO. I was just I was just having this discussion with Alan today because you know where we went for the very first time in our lives.

1350
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:32,000
I'd never been to before a super target because there's only one of them in Nor Calis that I know of.

1351
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:38,000
And it's on the drive home from L.A. because we took the ninety nine back because I guess there was construction on five.

1352
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:42,000
Ninety nine is the best. You pass the Bravo cheese farm.

1353
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:45,000
And you know, we stopped there to a fucking love Bravo.

1354
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:49,000
Get me some sage cheese. Oh, I didn't know you like that stuff. I would like garlic in the sage.

1355
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:54,000
But anyway, well, we'll be back to L.A. someday. But anyway, not just that, but there's a super target in fucking Merced of all places.

1356
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:59,000
And so I was like, well, I want to see what makes super target super. And I knew I knew it was like the grocery thing.

1357
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:03,000
And I'm told and there's probably folks in chat that are like, what's the big fucking deal?

1358
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:08,000
I'm told these are all over the place in the Midwest and stuff, but I had never been one been to one before.

1359
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:11,000
And they do. They have the full fucking grocery there. So I went there.

1360
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:14,000
So that led to this whole discussion about retail stores that aren't around anymore.

1361
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:18,000
We were talking about Montgomery Ward. We're talking about Gemco. I've never heard of Gemco.

1362
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:22,000
And best. Are these all California only things I get? Maybe.

1363
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:28,000
I think I'd seen the best when it went out of business here because it had the thing that lifted up.

1364
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:34,000
Yeah. And now it's our best buy, which I think is funny. Circuit City.

1365
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:37,000
Yes. Circuit. Oh, Circuit City did not come up in our discussions.

1366
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:44,000
But yes, that is a that is so weird to me because I remember a time when Circuit City was still open and we were doing this show because it was the we launch.

1367
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:48,000
Yeah. Circuits. We went over there when they would launch the we over there. Anyway.

1368
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:50,000
I bought headphones on the way out of business.

1369
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:55,000
Going to our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

1370
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:59,000
Act F says best. They still exist. Holy fuck. No, we were talking about we were talking about stores that were gone.

1371
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:06,000
They're no longer there. Mervyn's was another one we mentioned. And what was the other clothing store that was gone?

1372
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:12,000
Maybe it was Montgomery Ward still. Come on, Noel Gustin chat says, oh, my parents bought my Mac at Montgomery Ward's.

1373
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:17,000
And Rama says Computer City. I've never heard of that. That must be a thing. CompUSA. How about that?

1374
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:23,000
CompUSA is still around. They were purchased and are along the lines now of Tiger Direct and Newegg.

1375
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:28,000
They also do like tutoring computer classes. I think it's still a thing that CompUSA does.

1376
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:32,000
But anyway, we're going to take a break. We're going to we're to reminisce a little more after the break.

1377
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:38,000
We get to rapid fire news. We're going to get to your phone calls at Orange Lounge Radio.

1378
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:44,000
Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype. When we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this break.

1379
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:59,000
And welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio. Live tonight, our 680th episode for this March 19th, 2017.

1380
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:05,000
That's right. Not only are we going to hit 15 years in a couple of months here, we'll also hit Episode 700 before the end of the year.

1381
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:11,000
A lot of a lot of big stuff for OLR going on this year. Thank you guys for joining us for the ride, whether it be for 15 years.

1382
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:17,000
Some of you in chat. Shout out, Dark Tetsuya. Or if it's only been, you know, if it's only been 15 minutes.

1383
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:23,000
Welcome to your first episode of OLR. Hope you've been having fun. Let's get into some other gaming news.

1384
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:28,000
I do want to get to rapid fire news, but I want to talk a little bit about what our announcer Jason brought up at the top of the show.

1385
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:33,000
I know he's a big fan of Rocket League, so I'm not surprised that he brought it up there at the top of the show.

1386
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:36,000
But, Loki, you've been reading what's going on with Rocket League, right?

1387
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:44,000
Yeah, so they're going to be doing an update. It's a new mode coming on March 22nd called Drop Shot, and it's kind of like their take on volleyball.

1388
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:51,000
So, unlike the current Rocket League game where it's, you know, you're trying to get into a goal or the net or whatever,

1389
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:57,000
you would actually be trying to hit floor panels by destroying them by throwing the ball into the air.

1390
01:37:57,000 --> 01:38:08,000
So, it's got a new arena called the Core 707, and it's got a bunch of small hexagons in that arena that you destroy to score points.

1391
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:15,000
And it says each panel needs two hits to break. So, it's going to have a new record stat, which is called damage.

1392
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:19,000
Have you been playing Rocket League online at all?

1393
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:21,000
Nope, I have yet to play this game.

1394
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:23,000
Oh my god, Loki, it's so fun. You've got to try it.

1395
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:24,000
I haven't, I just...

1396
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:29,000
Oh, just seriously, take like five seconds, fire it up, and just try it, because a round is quick.

1397
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:32,000
It's only going to take you like three minutes, and you don't even have to play real people.

1398
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:37,000
Like, I pretty much only play AI. I have done real people. I'll do real people with friends.

1399
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:41,000
Like, some of you guys may know Princess Irene. She's been on the show before.

1400
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:46,000
Like, I remember playing a few rounds with her before. Like, she would just pull me into these matches that she'd be playing with some of her friends,

1401
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:49,000
and we jump in, and it's a lot of fun, Loki. You really should try it.

1402
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:53,000
Like, you don't have to invest a lot of time in it, and it's stupid easy to learn, too.

1403
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:59,000
So, but, I think all this stuff is cool, even though I don't personally get really involved with the competitiveness,

1404
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:06,000
but it is neat to see this little title that I don't, I don't think people thought it was going to go very far,

1405
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:09,000
because it was like, what, it was a PlayStation Plus title that was, you know, given away in the beginning,

1406
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:15,000
and it's just become like a huge thing in gaming, going on to, what, now it's fourth season, right?

1407
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:19,000
So, going in chat for some comments over at live.vognetware.com.

1408
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:22,000
S2100matt says, I haven't played Rocket League in a couple months.

1409
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:24,000
Actf says, Rocket League is pretty awesome.

1410
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:29,000
And Kaijutoan says, so now we have soccer, basketball, hockey, volleyball.

1411
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:31,000
Good job, Rocket League.

1412
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:32,000
There you go.

1413
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:35,000
Dartetsuya says, my brother plays a lot of Rocket League.

1414
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:38,000
He made it sound like it's Breakout, this new mode.

1415
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:39,000
Oh, that's pretty cool.

1416
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:41,000
A little bit of retro stuff.

1417
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:47,000
All right, let's get into some rapid fire news and talk about what else has been going on in the gaming industry at a rapid pace. Loki.

1418
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:53,000
All right, so, I mean, I haven't really been anticipating it, but it's coming out right around the corner.

1419
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:57,000
Super Mario Run's coming to Android next week.

1420
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:59,000
So, March 23rd is when it's going to release.

1421
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:03,000
Hooray, it'll be...

1422
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:05,000
Will you be picking it up?

1423
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:08,000
I'll try the demo, I guess.

1424
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:11,000
But I'm not all that excited for it.

1425
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:13,000
Yeah, maybe my son.

1426
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:16,000
I might get that for Josh or something.

1427
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:18,000
Because he likes Mario.

1428
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:20,000
So, that'll be coming out.

1429
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:22,000
They're going to offer the first three levels for free.

1430
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:23,000
$10 for the full game.

1431
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:25,000
Kind of like it is on iOS.

1432
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:27,000
So, look for that.

1433
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:30,000
Like we were talking a little bit earlier about backwards compatibility on Xbox One.

1434
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:32,000
They're going to be getting some new games as well.

1435
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:35,000
So, Street Fighter IV is the major title that's part of this release.

1436
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:41,000
Luxor 2, Poker Smash, and Madballs in Babo Evasion.

1437
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:43,000
I remember interviewing those guys.

1438
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:45,000
Or talking to them over E3.

1439
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:47,000
Oh, yeah. I remember that. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1440
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:49,000
So, they're going to be...

1441
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:51,000
Those are going to be added to the backwards compatibility list.

1442
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:53,000
So, it's...

1443
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:56,000
I got to say, I'm just surprised that it's got all this stuff on there.

1444
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:58,000
I want to say I think I have...

1445
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:00,000
I think I have those.

1446
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:02,000
At least a few of those.

1447
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:05,000
Yeah, Street Fighter IV, the original I certainly have.

1448
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:07,000
But I'm not sure I'd want to go back and play that on Xbox One.

1449
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:13,000
Because to be fair, I have like the super uber version on PlayStation 4 I bought on some sale.

1450
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:15,000
And I have it on Steam.

1451
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:17,000
So, it's kind of like, eh.

1452
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:19,000
I don't need the vanilla one.

1453
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:21,000
Oh, interesting case.

1454
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:23,000
But I know that Poker Smash was like...

1455
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:26,000
Wasn't that game kind of like in some way similar to Rocket League?

1456
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:28,000
Where it was like this really small little release.

1457
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:30,000
And it kind of has a huge cult following.

1458
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:34,000
I thought that was that game that like really kind of blew up on Xbox Live.

1459
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:36,000
I could be wrong. I don't know.

1460
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:39,000
Anyway, let's talk about South by Southwest.

1461
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:41,000
That happened recently.

1462
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:43,000
I didn't even realize that happened this past week.

1463
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:45,000
But that's apparently been going on.

1464
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:47,000
It's a music, games, and film festival that was underway this past week.

1465
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:49,000
And they had the Video Games Award Show.

1466
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:52,000
This is the fourth year of the South by Southwest Video Games Award Show.

1467
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:57,000
And the Game of the Year awarded by South by Southwest, Uncharted 4, A Thief's End.

1468
01:41:57,000 --> 01:41:59,000
That was the big winner there.

1469
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:01,000
Some of the other awards, I'm not going to read these all,

1470
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:05,000
but some of the other big winners for musical score, Doom by Bethesda.

1471
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:08,000
Let's see, Excellence in Multiplayer, Overwatch.

1472
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:12,000
Excellence in Convergence, Batman, the Telltale series.

1473
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:16,000
Excellence in Gameplay also went to Doom.

1474
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:22,000
The Matthew Crump Cultural Innovation Award went to That Dragon Cancer,

1475
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:26,000
which, you know, that was a game that came out I think much earlier in 2016

1476
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:29,000
that certainly had a very, very strong story to it

1477
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:31,000
that affected a lot of people.

1478
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:34,000
And the Mobile Game of the Year was? Any guesses?

1479
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:36,000
Any guesses? Big mobile game? Almost everybody played it.

1480
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:37,000
Pokemon Go?

1481
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:39,000
That's right, Pokemon Go was the Mobile Game of the Year.

1482
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:42,000
Again, that was the South by Southwest Awards.

1483
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:45,000
I think I might have mentioned this a little bit at the top of the show,

1484
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:47,000
but just in case, I want to reiterate it now.

1485
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:51,000
The Splatoon 2 Global Test Fire is coming up.

1486
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:55,000
It's going to start on March 24th and run through March 26th.

1487
01:42:55,000 --> 01:43:01,000
But keep in mind, there are only six very specific one-hour periods

1488
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:02,000
that you can play.

1489
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:05,000
As a reminder, it's for one hour beginning at these times.

1490
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:09,000
On March 24th, noon, and 8 p.m. Pacific.

1491
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:13,000
On March 25th, 4 a.m., noon, and 8 Pacific.

1492
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:17,000
On March 26th, 4 a.m. Pacific.

1493
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:19,000
So those are the six time frames you can do it.

1494
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:24,000
Now, you can download the app or whatever you want to call it on Switch.

1495
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:27,000
You can actually download the Test Fire client right now.

1496
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:32,000
And I will say this for the Switch, loading games is fast.

1497
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:34,000
Like, I downloaded that client pretty fast.

1498
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:38,000
I don't know if that's because, again, I'm not having the same Wi-Fi issues

1499
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:40,000
it seems a lot of other people are having.

1500
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:43,000
But yeah, it was pretty easy to get that installed on the Switch.

1501
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:48,000
So my advice before March 24th and the first hour of this,

1502
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:51,000
you probably want to get this installed on your thing.

1503
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:53,000
And remember, it's free.

1504
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:57,000
So don't be butt hurt if it goes up and down during that hour

1505
01:43:57,000 --> 01:44:02,000
because that is what it's for, is to test and make sure it works.

1506
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:05,000
Meanwhile, let's go to Dark Sakura with some more news.

1507
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:09,000
There is an emulator that will play Pokemon Yellow.

1508
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:12,000
And guess what it's on? The Apple Watch.

1509
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:18,000
There is a Game Boy emulator that basically is still under testing.

1510
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:22,000
It doesn't have many games available to do on it yet,

1511
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:26,000
but they are working on getting Pokemon Yellow to run well.

1512
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:28,000
And the emulator is called Giovanni.

1513
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:31,000
Of course, now it's not anything official,

1514
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:34,000
but it looks kind of neat to see it in motion.

1515
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:39,000
I mean, other people have tried to bring Doom over,

1516
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:42,000
which I don't know how that would work, but whatever.

1517
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:52,000
And then, in other news, Rock Band 4 is going to be getting some crossovers.

1518
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:56,000
We will be getting some with Mass Effect and Archer.

1519
01:44:56,000 --> 01:45:07,000
So basically, Sterling Archer is going to be a character model for Rock Band 4.

1520
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:09,000
Nice.

1521
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:15,000
And then there's also some Mass Effect Andromeda-themed outfits,

1522
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:19,000
including a Normandy base and N7 armor.

1523
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:21,000
That sounds ridiculous.

1524
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:24,000
That does sound ridiculous. Sign me up.

1525
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:25,000
That's it.

1526
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:30,000
Alright, let's travel around and check out what's coming out in stores at retail this week.

1527
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:32,000
The important thing to mention about that last story, though,

1528
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:36,000
is that they're releasing the song or Kenny Loggins' Danger Zone.

1529
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:38,000
They go along with the Sterling Archer.

1530
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:40,000
Ah, Jesus.

1531
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:43,000
How is that not already there?

1532
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:45,000
That's news, too.

1533
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:47,000
How is that not already there?

1534
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:49,000
Alright, that's cool, though.

1535
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:54,000
Anyways, so this week we've got Mass Effect Andromeda coming out on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

1536
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:56,000
Eeeee!

1537
01:45:56,000 --> 01:46:01,000
Tokidin 2 on PC, PlayStation 4, and Levita.

1538
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:05,000
Troll NI on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

1539
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:08,000
There's a lot of people on the internet that can relate to that.

1540
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:10,000
Yep.

1541
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:15,000
And then Dreamfall Chapters, the longest journey on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

1542
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:19,000
A 3DS game, Mario Sports Superstars on 3DS.

1543
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:26,000
And last but not least, Zero Escape, the Nonary games on PC, PlayStation 4, and Vita.

1544
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:29,000
Alright, let's go to Japan. Hi, Japan.

1545
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:34,000
Let me butcher some pronunciations for you of your releases coming up on March 23rd on the PlayStation 4.

1546
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:37,000
Deus Ex, Mankind Divided, released in Japan.

1547
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:43,000
Also on March 23rd, Eagle Flight and Farming Simulator 17 are released.

1548
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:49,000
WRC 6 Fia World Rally Championship, and Gen'Dai Daisen Ryaku comes out.

1549
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:53,000
Oh, excuse me, 2017, specifically, comes out this week.

1550
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:58,000
That is one of those airplane-type games, which it looks like it's half a mix between one of those

1551
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:03,000
those, uh, strategical games, like in Advance War, mixed with plane fighting type of thing.

1552
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:08,000
So, because I think those types of, like, Ace Combat games tend to do a little better overseas.

1553
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:12,000
Not that they don't do well here, but they do really well overseas, I believe.

1554
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:18,000
Uh, in Japan this week, you can look forward to Tokaiden 2, Hatsuyuki Sakura in regular and limited edition,

1555
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:26,000
Sidekicks, and Biohazard Revelations 2 gets a price reduction as it moves into the best series on the Vita.

1556
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:29,000
And, let me see if they have anything listed for retail on the Switch.

1557
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:35,000
No, nothing on retail for the Switch this week, which, you know, is kind of the same thing here.

1558
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:38,000
Uh, we're just getting our stuff on the online digital stuff.

1559
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:46,000
So, uh, the 3DS, however, uh, not seeing their Mario Sports Superstars until March 30th,

1560
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:48,000
so you're gonna have to wait another week for that.

1561
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:50,000
And, of course, the matching Amiibo cards.

1562
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:53,000
So, in the meanwhile, we'll have to move over to the UK.

1563
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:55,000
Uh-oh.

1564
01:47:55,000 --> 01:47:56,000
I'd like to, I'd like to move there.

1565
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:57,000
Yes, yes.

1566
01:47:57,000 --> 01:47:58,000
For wheels.

1567
01:47:58,000 --> 01:48:05,000
Um, on the 23rd, we have Bye Bye Box Boy for 3DS and Mass Effect Andromeda, yay!

1568
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:16,000
On the 24th, Dreamfall Chapters for several systems, uh, Tokaiden 2 for PC, PlayStation Vita, and for PlayStation 4.

1569
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:17,000
That's it.

1570
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:18,000
Alright.

1571
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:22,000
Well, we're about to go back to Dark Sakura, because every week you guys send us emails.

1572
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:27,000
Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to send us emails.

1573
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:34,000
And, of course, Dark Sakura always prepares in advance by opening up the email bag earlier before the show even starts

1574
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:38,000
to find the emails that she's gonna be reading for you tonight.

1575
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:41,000
To find nothing, you think?

1576
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:42,000
Parts, nice.

1577
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:43,000
Oh, there's some stuff.

1578
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:46,000
I was like, I thought I saw one from our favorite emailer.

1579
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:47,000
Okay.

1580
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:48,000
Um, this-

1581
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:50,000
One of our fa- I don't play favorites, sorry.

1582
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:51,000
Hey.

1583
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:52,000
Reedon.

1584
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:53,000
Sorry.

1585
01:48:53,000 --> 01:48:57,000
I just received a Kindle Fire tablet that I was gifted from Valentine's Day.

1586
01:48:57,000 --> 01:49:01,000
Only real complaints were that the touchscreen isn't as sensitive as it probably should be.

1587
01:49:01,000 --> 01:49:05,000
The volume is pretty low, plus there's a lot of Android apps not on the App Store.

1588
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:10,000
Among the apps I checked out to download was the Twitch app, and I realized, of course, it is on the Fire.

1589
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:18,000
What I usually watch on Twitch is the Salty Bet feed, even though I don't have an account to gamble virtual currency.

1590
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:23,000
I have tried joining Jackbox games that streamers didn't have locked down to subscribers.

1591
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:27,000
Fun, although the ten second delay made some of the games tough to play.

1592
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:35,000
Also, as far as YouTube LPs, or I guess long plays, I have been watching Game Grumps Ross's wife, Commander Holly, playing Night in the Woods.

1593
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:40,000
I stopped watching only because I really want to play that myself, assuming my 2009 MacBook could run it.

1594
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:41,000
Upgrade.

1595
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:42,000
It's time to upgrade.

1596
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:50,000
Mostly I'm still watching the custom Super Mario World roms and indie games played by Rail Cow, I guess.

1597
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:52,000
That comes from Robert M.

1598
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:57,000
Alright, awesome. I don't think I picked up a question in there.

1599
01:49:57,000 --> 01:49:58,000
It's just an email.

1600
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:00,000
But thank you for the update.

1601
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:02,000
Alright. Hello, LR.

1602
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:06,000
Just a few thoughts on last week's very busy episode.

1603
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:13,000
On the subject of Switch's forthcoming video streaming apps, we learned the importance of first impressions with Street Fighter V.

1604
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:17,000
Yes, many features and improvements have been added since the game released 13 months ago.

1605
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:21,000
But the folks that looked at version 1.0 and said, nope, did not all come around.

1606
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:24,000
Most of them came, saw, and left.

1607
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:26,000
Onto the Switch.

1608
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:31,000
Already on Amazon.com, multiple people have asked, does it play Netflix?

1609
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:34,000
And of course, the answers all say no.

1610
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:39,000
Once the public understands that it does not play Netflix, how will they later be convinced that it does?

1611
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:43,000
Generally, the word of mouth on device happens when the device comes out.

1612
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:47,000
This might happen a second time around the holidays, but that is in no way assured.

1613
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:53,000
I'm not sure Nintendo will be able to convince the public at large that it plays Netflix later, even if it actually does.

1614
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:55,000
I hope I'm wrong, though.

1615
01:50:56,000 --> 01:51:01,000
Robby pointed out that with Switch, it's easy to bring a game to a friend's house.

1616
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:06,000
I will point out that if you use an external hard drive on Xbox One, it was already very easy to do that.

1617
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:09,000
Except you can do it with digital games as well.

1618
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:16,000
Simply plug in your external drive with installed games into a friend's Xbox One, then sign into their console.

1619
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:20,000
Give it a few minutes to index what's on the drive and you'll be able to play everything on it with no hassle.

1620
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:24,000
You can even use your own save file because your cloud save will follow you there.

1621
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:29,000
Honestly, I feel that this is currently the overall most user friendly solution across all platforms.

1622
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:33,000
I really don't have anything else to say, so I will challenge you to say this seven times fast.

1623
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:36,000
Sally sells six switches, Sally sells six switches, whatever.

1624
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:39,000
Now I'm running away. Well, I also have throat problems.

1625
01:51:39,000 --> 01:51:42,000
And that comes from YYR.

1626
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:47,000
Hi, YYR. I did not know that about the Xbox One. That's pretty cool.

1627
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:50,000
But you did have to use the word if, and it's for a good reason.

1628
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:54,000
It's not something that's kind of like natively a part of the console.

1629
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:56,000
I mean, it is and it isn't. You know what I mean?

1630
01:51:56,000 --> 01:52:00,000
Like, you have to have this external hard drive and you have to put your files on it.

1631
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:04,000
It's not quite the same thing, although I will give you certainly the props.

1632
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:10,000
It is an additional feature that I certainly wasn't aware of before, so there you go.

1633
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:13,000
Bobby Blackwolf in chat over at live.fognetwork.com says,

1634
01:52:13,000 --> 01:52:16,000
The Wii didn't play Netflix when it first came out either.

1635
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:19,000
Neither did the Xbox or PlayStation 3.

1636
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:23,000
To be fair, though, the landscape ten years ago, we lived in a world before House of Cards

1637
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:28,000
and before Orange is the New Black, which those shows really transformed Netflix into something different.

1638
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:31,000
The landscape is different now than it was then.

1639
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:36,000
I still kind of stand by what I said about the Netflix stuff.

1640
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:38,000
I think it's something that will be important.

1641
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:44,000
I'm not so sure that I totally agree with what you're saying here, YYR,

1642
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:52,000
because Nintendo is kind of different in the fact that they can get Reggie Fils-Aime booked on any talk show that they want.

1643
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:56,000
I mean, he was just on CBS This Morning in some clip.

1644
01:52:56,000 --> 01:53:00,000
They get him on The Tonight Show all the time, and if they want to try to get a different thing out there

1645
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:04,000
and get him to show Netflix on these consoles and stuff, they'll do it.

1646
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:11,000
So I just feel like they can kind of control the conversation a little better than some other people can.

1647
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:13,000
So I don't know.

1648
01:53:13,000 --> 01:53:19,000
I sort of think around the holidays they're really going to push that narrative with whatever happens.

1649
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:25,000
I think the Switch is going to look a lot different around the holiday than it does right now.

1650
01:53:25,000 --> 01:53:33,000
But I will also say the longer I'm kind of having my Switch and using it, I'm really liking it a lot more just as a console.

1651
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:39,000
I'm really liking this whole handheld TV thing a lot more than I originally thought I would.

1652
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:43,000
The longer I'm with it, the more I'm really into it, especially as more games are coming out that aren't just Zelda.

1653
01:53:43,000 --> 01:53:45,000
So pretty cool.

1654
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:49,000
I'm still, you know, I don't think it's perfect, and there's still a lot of things that bug me about it.

1655
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:54,000
The $70 Pro Controller being one of them, but damn, it is a nice controller.

1656
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:57,000
Anyway, thanks for the email. Nonetheless, YYR.

1657
01:53:57,000 --> 01:54:00,000
That was it for emails tonight, right?

1658
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:01,000
That was all.

1659
01:54:01,000 --> 01:54:06,000
All right. Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you wish to send us an email in the future.

1660
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:08,000
Here we go.

1661
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:13,000
I want to say before we get back to news, because Bobby's bringing this up as well and it's worth responding to.

1662
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:20,000
I love that 10 years ago we all bitched about how our game consoles being less about games and more about media devices,

1663
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:27,000
and now we're bitching about our game consoles are too much about games and not spending enough time talking about TV and sports.

1664
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:30,000
Here's the thing.

1665
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:35,000
I'm not approaching this necessarily as a gamer.

1666
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:39,000
I always use this analogy all the stinkin' time with Nintendo.

1667
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:43,000
If y'all haven't seen the YouTube clip by now, what's stopping you?

1668
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:51,000
You need to go look up Tyra Banks yells at contestant when she was on America's Next Top Model going,

1669
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:55,000
We were rooting for you! We were all rooting for you! How dare you!

1670
01:54:55,000 --> 01:54:57,000
And all this stuff.

1671
01:54:57,000 --> 01:55:00,000
The reason why, and this is me in particular, and I don't know if Bobby directed that comment to me.

1672
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:07,000
He might not have, but I still want to just say from my perspective why I do think Nintendo should put Netflix on this thing,

1673
01:55:07,000 --> 01:55:10,000
even though yes I am a gamer first and all this stuff,

1674
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:16,000
is that I also realize Nintendo is able to reach an audience of a lot of different type of people because they did it with the Wii,

1675
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:21,000
and they reached that soccer mom audience, and they reached a larger audience of people that weren't just gamers.

1676
01:55:21,000 --> 01:55:28,000
And the way that they can do that is through some of these apps and things that maybe we as gamers don't necessarily like.

1677
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:34,000
But it's like this whole fact that you can do Netflix on TV or on the device,

1678
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:39,000
pick it up, take it with you, pick up from where you left off because Netflix will let you download your shows now,

1679
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:42,000
depending on what show it is and all this stuff.

1680
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:47,000
It's one of those things where it's more a missed opportunity to sell the system further.

1681
01:55:47,000 --> 01:55:49,000
And that's what it is for me.

1682
01:55:49,000 --> 01:55:53,000
Especially, I would think that you would want to put a lot of the tablet features that they have out there,

1683
01:55:53,000 --> 01:56:00,000
like different apps and things, for those people that may not necessarily game all the time or more casual gamers.

1684
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:06,000
I would say you can even go as far as putting books on there.

1685
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:11,000
Because it has a tablet, use it for reading books.

1686
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:15,000
I mean, I wouldn't use a tablet for that, but it's something that people could use it for.

1687
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:19,000
Or streaming media or a lot of different things.

1688
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:22,000
I mean, I think why cut yourself short?

1689
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:30,000
Someone develops the app for it, say Barnes and Noble or whatever wants to develop their stupid Nook app for it.

1690
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:33,000
Who gives a shit? So what if no one downloads it?

1691
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:39,000
Oh my God, I would be so happy if they did a TuneIn app on that thing so people could listen to Vogue and Network.

1692
01:56:39,000 --> 01:56:44,000
Granted, there's no cellular networks, they couldn't do it on the go unless there's Wi-Fi, but still it would be pretty cool.

1693
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:48,000
Yeah, I mean, who cares? If people don't utilize it, no big deal.

1694
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:51,000
But at least it's there for the people who do want to utilize it.

1695
01:56:51,000 --> 01:56:55,000
So yes, I'm going to ask, as a gamer, I'm going to ask, where are the games?

1696
01:56:55,000 --> 01:57:00,000
And we're seeing Nintendo answer that a little bit, to be fair to Nintendo.

1697
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:08,000
Even though that first week it looked a little dicey, the two weeks that have followed up, at least online, have been pretty strong.

1698
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:11,000
Especially compared to Wii U, especially compared to Wii U.

1699
01:57:11,000 --> 01:57:14,000
So I do feel like Nintendo's making improvements there, awesome.

1700
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:28,000
I think this other thing, this Netflix thing and some of the things that Loki's bringing up there, could really transform this this holiday into these talking pieces that are going to get more non-gamers or casual gamers invested in the system.

1701
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:33,000
And then that's a win-win for all of us because now third parties are going to want to come back to Nintendo.

1702
01:57:33,000 --> 01:57:41,000
But as somebody in chat pointed out over at live.vognetwork.com, who said this here? Somebody had said that the system's selling anyway.

1703
01:57:41,000 --> 01:57:47,000
So it seems to be doing well right now. And yeah, so the system is doing pretty well right now.

1704
01:57:47,000 --> 01:57:58,000
So it's based on the sales numbers earlier. So maybe Nintendo doesn't need my stinking advice, but I do feel like those things are going to be there by year's end.

1705
01:57:58,000 --> 01:58:01,000
But that's the whole reason we did the time capsule. We'll find out.

1706
01:58:01,000 --> 01:58:08,000
Alright, let's get back into some other news. We want to get into what Loki was going to talk about here.

1707
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:18,000
Yeah, so the PlayStation blog announced that Drawn to Death is going to be coming to the PlayStation 4 April 4th.

1708
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:22,000
And what's kind of cool is it will be free for PlayStation Plus subscribers.

1709
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:30,000
So this is, if you're not familiar with it, it is the new game by David Jeff, who did like the Twisted Metal series.

1710
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:36,000
And it's kind of a third-person, over-the-top third-person shooter that exists in a notebook.

1711
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:40,000
So it looks like sketches done by a high school student or something like that.

1712
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:45,000
So it looks cool. And the fact they get to play it for free is another bonus.

1713
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:55,000
They haven't really announced yet what additional games are going to be coming out for April's, you know, games of the PlayStation Plus stuff.

1714
01:58:55,000 --> 01:58:58,000
But at least we know one of them.

1715
01:58:58,000 --> 01:59:05,000
There you go. I'm excited to check this out. That trailer looked neat, so I'm curious to see.

1716
01:59:05,000 --> 01:59:07,000
You know, free is a great price.

1717
01:59:07,000 --> 01:59:15,000
And as we were just talking about at the top of the segment with Rocket League, did very well for itself as a free game originally, and now is everywhere.

1718
01:59:15,000 --> 01:59:18,000
Maybe this game will do very well for itself as well.

1719
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:25,000
All right. Hey, do you remember, this was probably almost a year ago at this point, maybe longer, that we were talking about this.

1720
01:59:25,000 --> 01:59:29,000
Primal Rage had a canceled sequel. You guys remember that?

1721
01:59:29,000 --> 01:59:36,000
Now obviously the canceled sequel is old. I remember talking about this, that it was unearthed or something relatively recently.

1722
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:41,000
So Atari was going to do a sequel to Primal Rage, which was the dinosaur fighting game. Remember that?

1723
01:59:41,000 --> 01:59:47,000
And that was when Jurassic Park was first out. So this was the type of shit that people wanted.

1724
01:59:47,000 --> 01:59:52,000
It was dinosaurs beating each other up, right? And then what, Turok was around that same time too, right?

1725
01:59:52,000 --> 02:00:00,000
Well, Killer Instinct, I mean, that's kind of almost like a, I don't know if that came up before or after, but was it sort of like a claymation-ish game?

1726
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:01,000
Clay Fighters.

1727
02:00:01,000 --> 02:00:08,000
Well, Clay Fighters was that, but the animation that was in this game, wasn't it claymation or did they do like CG rendered to like sprites?

1728
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:17,000
I think it was like CG rendered sprite type of things. So, but anyway, Atari was working on a sequel that was going to be released in 96, but it was shelved around 1995.

1729
02:00:17,000 --> 02:00:19,000
They didn't actually end up releasing it.

1730
02:00:19,000 --> 02:00:29,000
However, get this, it is now out there available to play in an emulator. There's still some buggy stuff in the game. It's not going to be perfect because the game was never actually released.

1731
02:00:29,000 --> 02:00:32,000
I think that you can only play one round before you have to restart the whole thing.

1732
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:39,000
Yeah, but you can, you can still check that out. It was, by the way, it was, it was stop motion fighting is what they did.

1733
02:00:39,000 --> 02:00:43,000
Okay, stop motion. Yeah, it did definitely have a look to it.

1734
02:00:43,000 --> 02:00:53,000
So, uh, pretty cool. You can check that out. There's a whole emulator available on a Weebly site. You could probably just Google for Primal Rage 2 and find that if you would like to give it a try.

1735
02:00:53,000 --> 02:01:01,000
I'm sure that they'll have a running in, well, it probably already runs in MAME. I'm curious to see if they can fix some of the bugs in it.

1736
02:01:01,000 --> 02:01:16,000
Yeah, same. Uh, it's kind of like, um, God, what was that game? There was some game that was released really recently where the guy, it was like the only copy of it out there, but the guy went in to try to fix some things and everybody was like, no, you need to put it out. Remember that? Remember that?

1737
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:23,000
Yeah. Well, I mean, now the pure game is out there. Primal Rage 2, the pure game is out there. So now try to fix it, Internet.

1738
02:01:23,000 --> 02:01:26,000
Or at least now fix it so that it doesn't crash after each level.

1739
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:27,000
Yeah.

1740
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:33,000
I mean, that, that's kind of just functionality. I, I don't see a problem in fixing that type of thing.

1741
02:01:33,000 --> 02:01:39,000
All right. Just a few more stories for you guys. We're going to open up the Skype line, but first we're gonna hear from Dark Sakura.

1742
02:01:39,000 --> 02:01:41,000
Yeah, do I gotta?

1743
02:01:41,000 --> 02:01:45,000
I guess you don't have to. It's a volunteer show.

1744
02:01:45,000 --> 02:01:59,000
Seriously. Um, and this one is, it just pisses me off so much because I would have hoped that the gamergate people would have learned that we don't care what they think and want them to shut up.

1745
02:02:01,000 --> 02:02:05,000
I'm, I'm just shocked that term is still out there all this time later.

1746
02:02:05,000 --> 02:02:07,000
Right? It's fucking stupid.

1747
02:02:07,000 --> 02:02:16,000
Dear men, women are not out to oppress you. You've been in charge for the last few million years. You know, shut up.

1748
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:18,000
So what's happening this time?

1749
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:33,000
Well, now there's an online harassment campaign that's been directed at a former EA employee who is blaming her for the animation problem in Mass Effect Andromeda.

1750
02:02:33,000 --> 02:02:38,000
And so basically Bioware put out a statement, actually Aaron Flynn put out a statement and I'll just read it.

1751
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:46,000
Recently, a former EA employee was misidentified as a lead member of the Mass Effect Andromeda development team. Those reports are false.

1752
02:02:46,000 --> 02:02:55,000
We respect the opinions of our players and community and welcome feedback on our games, but attacking individuals regardless of their involvement in the project is never acceptable.

1753
02:02:55,000 --> 02:02:58,000
Good on EA for making a statement like that, to be honest.

1754
02:02:58,000 --> 02:03:09,000
That's from Aaron Flynn, the Bioware GM. So it's basically, um, they just need to shut up really.

1755
02:03:09,000 --> 02:03:17,000
And it turns out that she was a writer or she, she was not as involved as people were pigging her out to be, right?

1756
02:03:17,000 --> 02:03:22,000
Like she was a part of a team of people, if I'm not mistaken. Am I right?

1757
02:03:22,000 --> 02:03:30,000
Yeah. A former, uh, it looks like she had been a former facial animator, but she's, she wasn't with the company and didn't work on Mass Effect Andromeda.

1758
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:33,000
It just basically people...

1759
02:03:33,000 --> 02:03:41,000
In general, it's, I'm going to make a broad generalization here, but I'm going to do it with purpose. Mob mentality needs to fucking stop.

1760
02:03:41,000 --> 02:03:44,000
It does. And the internet makes it so easy.

1761
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:45,000
It does.

1762
02:03:45,000 --> 02:03:53,000
People need to break away from this hive mind of hate.

1763
02:03:53,000 --> 02:04:01,000
This is, this is literally the modern version. I don't, I don't even have to say a particular group's name or anything like that.

1764
02:04:01,000 --> 02:04:07,000
This is literally the modern version of she's a witch. Burn the witch.

1765
02:04:07,000 --> 02:04:08,000
Yeah, it is.

1766
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:10,000
Think about it. Think about it.

1767
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:11,000
It's hysteria.

1768
02:04:11,000 --> 02:04:18,000
When you read that shit in the history books, don't you go, wow, those people were fucking nuts.

1769
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:19,000
Think about it.

1770
02:04:19,000 --> 02:04:22,000
It's, it's hysteria for the sake of hysteria.

1771
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:26,000
You know, fueled by unfounded fear is really what it is.

1772
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:38,000
It's people letting their own fear, their own insecurities and their own prejudices running wild and sucking other people into their vacuum of stupid.

1773
02:04:38,000 --> 02:04:42,000
And Kaijuto in chat says, even if she did work on it, she shouldn't be attacked.

1774
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:46,000
Yes. Very good point that I should have also made sure to say.

1775
02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:47,000
So very good point.

1776
02:04:47,000 --> 02:04:58,000
Even if she, even, even if she like single handedly wrote the game from start to finish herself, like, go, go do something positive with your life for God's sake.

1777
02:04:58,000 --> 02:05:00,000
Go do something.

1778
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:02,000
Go, go help a charity.

1779
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:04,000
Go volunteer for something you do believe in.

1780
02:05:04,000 --> 02:05:06,000
Don't, don't attack this person.

1781
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:07,000
Or how about this?

1782
02:05:07,000 --> 02:05:08,000
Over a game.

1783
02:05:08,000 --> 02:05:09,000
How about this?

1784
02:05:09,000 --> 02:05:10,000
Stop.

1785
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:11,000
Just stop.

1786
02:05:11,000 --> 02:05:15,000
If you're going to say something hateful, stop.

1787
02:05:15,000 --> 02:05:17,000
No one cares what you think.

1788
02:05:17,000 --> 02:05:21,000
Do y'all send shit to Adam Sandler for the movies?

1789
02:05:21,000 --> 02:05:24,000
Do y'all do this to Rob?

1790
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:27,000
Do y'all do this to David Spade?

1791
02:05:27,000 --> 02:05:31,000
Well, she turned me into a newt.

1792
02:05:31,000 --> 02:05:33,000
A newt?

1793
02:05:34,000 --> 02:05:37,000
I got better.

1794
02:05:37,000 --> 02:05:40,000
So she weighs the same as a duck.

1795
02:05:40,000 --> 02:05:42,000
She's made of wood.

1796
02:05:42,000 --> 02:05:45,000
And therefore, a witch.

1797
02:05:45,000 --> 02:05:52,000
No, I, I just think that, I think we need to stop paying attention to these fuckers.

1798
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:53,000
I mean, seriously.

1799
02:05:53,000 --> 02:05:58,000
Well, you brought them up, Dark Sakura, maybe you shouldn't have.

1800
02:05:58,000 --> 02:06:02,000
I brought it up because it has to do with Mass Effect.

1801
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:07,000
To be fair, is it gamer gay people or is it people just flipping out because they have

1802
02:06:07,000 --> 02:06:09,000
shit they don't like, like they did with the Jim Sterling article?

1803
02:06:09,000 --> 02:06:11,000
It's some people who have been associated with gamer.

1804
02:06:11,000 --> 02:06:13,000
I'm going to back up.

1805
02:06:13,000 --> 02:06:17,000
I don't give a fuck who they are or what they call themselves.

1806
02:06:17,000 --> 02:06:21,000
They're being a mob and the angry mob needs to fucking stop.

1807
02:06:21,000 --> 02:06:23,000
I don't care what the label is.

1808
02:06:23,000 --> 02:06:26,000
If you're participating in this, stop.

1809
02:06:26,000 --> 02:06:30,000
Sometimes it has to be addressed to tell them off.

1810
02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:33,000
It just, it's a whole group of people.

1811
02:06:33,000 --> 02:06:37,000
You know, I was going back to people not thinking for themselves or being weak willed.

1812
02:06:37,000 --> 02:06:39,000
This is fucking weak willed bullshit.

1813
02:06:39,000 --> 02:06:44,000
This is one person says something and other people are using this person to enable them.

1814
02:06:44,000 --> 02:06:47,000
Hello, American election system.

1815
02:06:47,000 --> 02:06:54,000
You know, it's people is the one person who will be vocal about the bullshit that assholes think about.

1816
02:06:54,000 --> 02:06:58,000
And they all rally to the head asshole.

1817
02:06:58,000 --> 02:07:02,000
So anyway, if you're going to, if you're going to accuse somebody of being a witch,

1818
02:07:02,000 --> 02:07:04,000
you better bring the receipt that she turns you into a newt.

1819
02:07:04,000 --> 02:07:06,000
You better have some proof.

1820
02:07:06,000 --> 02:07:08,000
Let's see some warts.

1821
02:07:08,000 --> 02:07:11,000
All right. Moving on. A couple more stories for you guys. Loki.

1822
02:07:11,000 --> 02:07:17,000
So Telltale's CEO, Kevin Brunner has stepped down.

1823
02:07:17,000 --> 02:07:23,000
So apparently he's been with the company since 2015.

1824
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:32,000
And, you know, oversaw development of the Minecraft story mode, The Walking Dead, and the Batman Telltale series.

1825
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:38,000
Of course, now that he has stepped down, it looks like the former founder or the co-founder,

1826
02:07:38,000 --> 02:07:44,000
who was the CEO role before Dan Conners, is going to be taking the place of him.

1827
02:07:47,000 --> 02:07:48,000
Interesting.

1828
02:07:48,000 --> 02:07:53,000
Yeah. Very interesting what this could mean for the future direction of the company or what have you.

1829
02:07:53,000 --> 02:07:58,000
But they seem to have cut themselves out a little bit of a niche for themselves with the storytelling games.

1830
02:07:58,000 --> 02:08:01,000
And, you know, a lot of them do very well. The Walking Dead stuff.

1831
02:08:01,000 --> 02:08:04,000
Looking for the Guardians of the Galaxy game is supposed to come down.

1832
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:07,000
I still need to play that Batman one. I really, really wanted to play that.

1833
02:08:07,000 --> 02:08:14,000
I just, it's one of those games that just got lost to the something shiny is out to play.

1834
02:08:14,000 --> 02:08:16,000
Yes, it is. That is very true.

1835
02:08:16,000 --> 02:08:21,000
Alright. And lastly, but not leastly tonight, get this.

1836
02:08:21,000 --> 02:08:28,000
So, we like to bitch about how there's download content that is actually pay-to-unlock content,

1837
02:08:28,000 --> 02:08:30,000
because it's stored on the disc.

1838
02:08:30,000 --> 02:08:35,000
In fact, checking back to that story about Street Fighter IV on Xbox One,

1839
02:08:35,000 --> 02:08:38,000
wasn't Street Fighter IV one of those first games that had that?

1840
02:08:38,000 --> 02:08:40,000
Like, some of those characters were actually on the disc?

1841
02:08:40,000 --> 02:08:42,000
I thought that was the thing.

1842
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:48,000
I remember if it was Street Fighter IV, I know that, like, Marvel vs. Capcom 3 had that stuff on there.

1843
02:08:48,000 --> 02:08:53,000
Maybe it was Street Fighter IV. I know Dead Rising was one of them, I thought.

1844
02:08:53,000 --> 02:09:00,000
Well, what we thought started with, oh, say, the Xbox 360, may have actually been in place a little bit earlier.

1845
02:09:00,000 --> 02:09:04,000
There was a game called Flosian Brothers. I don't even know how to pronounce this.

1846
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:08,000
Flosian Brothers. Do you know this game? It was a Dreamcast game, developed by Visual Concepts.

1847
02:09:09,000 --> 02:09:17,000
They now do work on 2K games titles, but Flosian Brothers was released in 2001, and it had Episode 1 in its title.

1848
02:09:17,000 --> 02:09:21,000
So, it was supposed to come out with more episodes later, but then the Dreamcast kind of...

1849
02:09:21,000 --> 02:09:23,000
I thought it was Phloygen.

1850
02:09:23,000 --> 02:09:25,000
Maybe that's it. Maybe it's Phloygen.

1851
02:09:25,000 --> 02:09:27,000
Yeah, it wasn't, like, that great of a game.

1852
02:09:27,000 --> 02:09:32,000
Well, maybe that's why it never got past Episode 1, that and the fact that the Dreamcast ended up folding up.

1853
02:09:32,000 --> 02:09:33,000
It had Frank Welker in it.

1854
02:09:33,000 --> 02:09:35,000
Did it? Oh, cool.

1855
02:09:35,000 --> 02:09:42,000
So, anyway, apparently, there was going to be download content for the first 12 months of the first episode.

1856
02:09:42,000 --> 02:09:49,000
Well, get this. The developers behind the game went back into an on-disk security measure they had,

1857
02:09:49,000 --> 02:09:55,000
and so they've actually released those 12 pieces of DLC on a place called Dreamcast Live,

1858
02:09:55,000 --> 02:10:00,000
so you can put the files on a Dreamcast VMU and play them in the original game.

1859
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:05,000
In other words, these additional 12 steps were on the disk already.

1860
02:10:05,000 --> 02:10:07,000
They were just, like, encrypted or something.

1861
02:10:07,000 --> 02:10:13,000
They were locked away, and now the key is out there all these years later since they never were able to be released.

1862
02:10:13,000 --> 02:10:19,000
So, if you want to check that out, you can check out dreamcastlive.net if you happen to own this game.

1863
02:10:19,000 --> 02:10:22,000
But, again, this is one... I have to admit, I never heard of this,

1864
02:10:22,000 --> 02:10:28,000
but this also came out in that, like, four-year period where I really wasn't playing a lot of video games, to be fair,

1865
02:10:28,000 --> 02:10:35,000
before I kind of got back into gaming when I picked up a Dreamcast and a GameCube and all that stuff way after the fact.

1866
02:10:35,000 --> 02:10:40,000
So, anyway, that's going to do it for our news tonight,

1867
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:45,000
but we're going to open up the Skype line at OrangeLoungeRadio, all one word on Skype.

1868
02:10:45,000 --> 02:10:50,000
If you'd like to give us a call, again, that's OrangeLoungeRadio, all one word on Skype.

1869
02:10:50,000 --> 02:10:53,000
Let me check in with some last-minute stories you guys might have.

1870
02:10:53,000 --> 02:10:56,000
DarkSakura? Loki? Anything you guys want to talk about?

1871
02:10:56,000 --> 02:11:00,000
Oh, actually, hold that thought, because we've got a call coming in right now.

1872
02:11:00,000 --> 02:11:02,000
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?

1873
02:11:02,000 --> 02:11:04,000
Hey, everyone, it's Ronbo.

1874
02:11:04,000 --> 02:11:06,000
Hey, buddy, how you doing?

1875
02:11:06,000 --> 02:11:07,000
Old.

1876
02:11:07,000 --> 02:11:09,000
You're old?

1877
02:11:09,000 --> 02:11:11,000
Yes, Rob, I'm old.

1878
02:11:11,000 --> 02:11:13,000
Well, I know that.

1879
02:11:13,000 --> 02:11:19,000
Yes, but due to some of the stuff you talked about tonight, you made me feel old.

1880
02:11:19,000 --> 02:11:21,000
Uh-oh.

1881
02:11:21,000 --> 02:11:24,000
What did I say, Rama?

1882
02:11:24,000 --> 02:11:32,000
Okay, first whole topic about stores that we used to go to as a kid.

1883
02:11:32,000 --> 02:11:36,000
Okay, because there was a chain of stores around here called Kaldor's,

1884
02:11:36,000 --> 02:11:41,000
and it was the Kohl's of its time, and I used to shop there all the time,

1885
02:11:41,000 --> 02:11:45,000
but they're no longer there, and I used to buy my games from there.

1886
02:11:45,000 --> 02:11:48,000
You probably remember another one called Consumers as well.

1887
02:11:48,000 --> 02:11:50,000
We didn't have them out here.

1888
02:11:50,000 --> 02:11:52,000
We had Woolworth's.

1889
02:11:52,000 --> 02:11:56,000
Yeah, Woolworth's. Aren't they still around, but overseas?

1890
02:11:56,000 --> 02:11:57,000
Not in the U.S.

1891
02:11:57,000 --> 02:11:58,000
Yeah, overseas.

1892
02:11:58,000 --> 02:12:00,000
It'll thrill you, yes. I asked them to.

1893
02:12:00,000 --> 02:12:03,000
Yeah. No, and there's restaurants.

1894
02:12:03,000 --> 02:12:08,000
I was just thinking Howard Johnson's was a chain of restaurants before it was a hotel, right?

1895
02:12:08,000 --> 02:12:11,000
And now there's one left in America somewhere?

1896
02:12:11,000 --> 02:12:14,000
I think there's still one somewhere around here somewhere.

1897
02:12:14,000 --> 02:12:17,000
I don't remember, but I think there is.

1898
02:12:18,000 --> 02:12:21,000
Act Efton Chat says, I miss KB Toys.

1899
02:12:21,000 --> 02:12:24,000
Yeah, I remember KB Toys.

1900
02:12:24,000 --> 02:12:29,000
We got these little Toys R Us Express locations, but they're not the same.

1901
02:12:29,000 --> 02:12:30,000
No, they're not the same.

1902
02:12:30,000 --> 02:12:33,000
Yeah, those kind of replaced a lot of the KB's around here too,

1903
02:12:33,000 --> 02:12:36,000
although Toys R Us I think has been doing pretty well,

1904
02:12:36,000 --> 02:12:42,000
but a lot of these big retail stores are really struggling in the era of online,

1905
02:12:42,000 --> 02:12:47,000
and Amazon is really killing a lot of people when it comes to the online stuff,

1906
02:12:47,000 --> 02:12:51,000
and I really think the next big one that's going to bite the dust

1907
02:12:51,000 --> 02:12:54,000
is sadly going to be Sears and K-Mart.

1908
02:12:54,000 --> 02:12:58,000
I mean, every year you hear something about how they're cutting back stores

1909
02:12:58,000 --> 02:12:59,000
and things are changing.

1910
02:12:59,000 --> 02:13:03,000
I mean, I'm kind of surprised there's any K-Marts left open at this point, to be honest.

1911
02:13:03,000 --> 02:13:08,000
Oh, it ain't K-Mart, but it's Radio Shack.

1912
02:13:08,000 --> 02:13:09,000
Oh, yeah.

1913
02:13:10,000 --> 02:13:12,000
We were like, are we not surprised?

1914
02:13:12,000 --> 02:13:14,000
I think everyone had their watch.

1915
02:13:14,000 --> 02:13:17,000
We're like, yeah, I called this, so let me collect on this bet here, you know?

1916
02:13:17,000 --> 02:13:22,000
Yeah, well, Radio Shack was trying to carve a niche.

1917
02:13:22,000 --> 02:13:25,000
It's the whole cell phone thing, which seemed to be the logical direction for them,

1918
02:13:25,000 --> 02:13:28,000
but I guess it wasn't enough.

1919
02:13:30,000 --> 02:13:33,000
Pretty much, but here's the reason why I called.

1920
02:13:33,000 --> 02:13:36,000
Now, top of the show, you were talking about game reviews and stuff,

1921
02:13:37,000 --> 02:13:41,000
and I've always said that I'm the average gamer.

1922
02:13:41,000 --> 02:13:44,000
I like what I like, you like what you like.

1923
02:13:44,000 --> 02:13:49,000
I pick my games based off what you like, you like, and you like.

1924
02:13:49,000 --> 02:13:53,000
Now, I've got friends who have pretty much, on my Facebook,

1925
02:13:53,000 --> 02:13:57,000
have ripped Breath of the Wild apart as pretty much a shit game,

1926
02:13:57,000 --> 02:14:01,000
anywhere from storyline to graphics.

1927
02:14:01,000 --> 02:14:05,000
Now, from part of the storyline I picked up, I find it interesting.

1928
02:14:05,000 --> 02:14:08,000
I'm not too big on the graphics, but that's just me.

1929
02:14:08,000 --> 02:14:12,000
But I will say, because of everybody talking about it,

1930
02:14:12,000 --> 02:14:18,000
I decided to play Ocarina of Time because I picked it up for 3DS.

1931
02:14:20,000 --> 02:14:24,000
And I'm still in the boat of, I do not like the 3D Zelda games.

1932
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:27,000
I'm playing them just to say that I have played them.

1933
02:14:27,000 --> 02:14:31,000
Well, in my opinion, Rama, here's the problem.

1934
02:14:31,000 --> 02:14:34,000
I am not a big fan of the 3D Zelda games either,

1935
02:14:34,000 --> 02:14:38,000
but I think Breath of the Wild and Ocarina of Time can't be compared.

1936
02:14:38,000 --> 02:14:41,000
I really don't think those two games are hardly the same thing

1937
02:14:41,000 --> 02:14:46,000
because I feel like Ocarina of Time came from a different era of development

1938
02:14:46,000 --> 02:14:50,000
that does share a lot with, yes, Twilight Princess, even Skyward Sword,

1939
02:14:50,000 --> 02:14:54,000
but I really feel like Breath of the Wild comes from a different,

1940
02:14:54,000 --> 02:14:57,000
like we're entering this newer era of development within Nintendo

1941
02:14:57,000 --> 02:15:00,000
where you can see the influence of things like,

1942
02:15:00,000 --> 02:15:03,000
as we checked at the top of the show,

1943
02:15:03,000 --> 02:15:06,000
things like Dark Souls was what I was getting to,

1944
02:15:06,000 --> 02:15:09,000
and Skyrim and things like that.

1945
02:15:09,000 --> 02:15:15,000
So I think for that reason, there's more to this new era of 3D Zeldas

1946
02:15:15,000 --> 02:15:18,000
than just the fact that it's 3D.

1947
02:15:18,000 --> 02:15:22,000
Yeah, I mean, I get it.

1948
02:15:22,000 --> 02:15:27,000
The new 3D game is pulling elements from other games to make it work,

1949
02:15:27,000 --> 02:15:28,000
and I'm okay with that.

1950
02:15:28,000 --> 02:15:31,000
But I was reading a review about how you pick up weapons in the game

1951
02:15:31,000 --> 02:15:33,000
after two or three hits they're destroying.

1952
02:15:33,000 --> 02:15:35,000
I'm like, you know what?

1953
02:15:35,000 --> 02:15:37,000
I don't know if I could deal with the game like that,

1954
02:15:37,000 --> 02:15:39,000
whether it's Zelda or not, you know?

1955
02:15:39,000 --> 02:15:43,000
And it's the most controversial part of the game's design.

1956
02:15:43,000 --> 02:15:45,000
I'll leave it at that for now.

1957
02:15:45,000 --> 02:15:47,000
But I have to say this.

1958
02:15:47,000 --> 02:15:49,000
I have to say this.

1959
02:15:49,000 --> 02:15:54,000
For someone to call this new Zelda a shit game,

1960
02:15:54,000 --> 02:15:58,000
that's a little bit sensationalistic to me.

1961
02:15:58,000 --> 02:16:01,000
Now, hey, everybody's welcome to their opinion,

1962
02:16:01,000 --> 02:16:04,000
and if they truly believe in their heart of hearts that it's a shit game,

1963
02:16:04,000 --> 02:16:06,000
then so be it.

1964
02:16:06,000 --> 02:16:10,000
Them and I have a completely different taste in gaming.

1965
02:16:10,000 --> 02:16:12,000
But it is going to make me go in the future

1966
02:16:12,000 --> 02:16:14,000
when that person says something about a different video game,

1967
02:16:14,000 --> 02:16:16,000
I'm going to be like,

1968
02:16:16,000 --> 02:16:19,000
isn't this the same person that called Zelda a shit game?

1969
02:16:19,000 --> 02:16:21,000
I have done that.

1970
02:16:21,000 --> 02:16:24,000
I've had friends say this game is shit, but they praise this.

1971
02:16:24,000 --> 02:16:28,000
I'm just like, well, you know, how do you say this and that?

1972
02:16:28,000 --> 02:16:31,000
We get our friendly banter back and forth.

1973
02:16:31,000 --> 02:16:35,000
Like I said, everybody is welcome to their opinion.

1974
02:16:35,000 --> 02:16:40,000
But to call it a shit game, I mean, a 7 out of 10 even,

1975
02:16:40,000 --> 02:16:44,000
at least I kind of go, okay, sure, different strokes for different folks.

1976
02:16:44,000 --> 02:16:46,000
The durability thing is kind of frustrating.

1977
02:16:46,000 --> 02:16:50,000
Yeah, I could see where somebody probably ended up giving it a 7 out of 10.

1978
02:16:50,000 --> 02:16:53,000
That's not what I would have given it, but okay.

1979
02:16:53,000 --> 02:16:58,000
But a shit game, it's a stretch.

1980
02:16:58,000 --> 02:17:00,000
Again, they're welcome to that opinion,

1981
02:17:00,000 --> 02:17:06,000
but I probably won't be using that opinion on their other gaming habits

1982
02:17:06,000 --> 02:17:08,000
to make my decisions, if that makes sense.

1983
02:17:08,000 --> 02:17:10,000
Fair enough.

1984
02:17:10,000 --> 02:17:13,000
All right, well, Rama, anything else you want to get out before I let you go?

1985
02:17:13,000 --> 02:17:17,000
I want to agree with something that Loki has said about

1986
02:17:17,000 --> 02:17:19,000
how Nintendo makes money left and right.

1987
02:17:19,000 --> 02:17:21,000
Let me tell you.

1988
02:17:21,000 --> 02:17:26,000
You still get Ocarina of Time for 40 bucks for 3DS,

1989
02:17:26,000 --> 02:17:32,000
and you can also get the Nintendo Selects version for $20.

1990
02:17:32,000 --> 02:17:37,000
I just think that's one of the most amazing scams Nintendo has ever come up with.

1991
02:17:37,000 --> 02:17:42,000
And can't you get the Virtual Console version for 10 bucks on Wii?

1992
02:17:42,000 --> 02:17:44,000
I don't have a Wii.

1993
02:17:44,000 --> 02:17:46,000
Well, now you have an emulator. You can check.

1994
02:17:46,000 --> 02:17:49,000
Maybe, but I'm just saying.

1995
02:17:49,000 --> 02:17:51,000
I'm like, I'm going to pick up the Selects version.

1996
02:17:51,000 --> 02:17:54,000
I go pick it up. I see right next to it the original version for $40,

1997
02:17:54,000 --> 02:17:57,000
and I'm just like, nah, Nintendo.

1998
02:17:57,000 --> 02:17:59,000
You're not getting my full 40.

1999
02:17:59,000 --> 02:18:01,000
That ain't happening. Not today.

2000
02:18:01,000 --> 02:18:03,000
Not this time. Not today, Satan. Not today.

2001
02:18:03,000 --> 02:18:06,000
Exactly, my dude. Exactly.

2002
02:18:06,000 --> 02:18:09,000
All right. My friend, I'm going to let you go to try to squeeze in a couple more calls,

2003
02:18:09,000 --> 02:18:10,000
but thanks for calling.

2004
02:18:10,000 --> 02:18:12,000
Well, let's try again, man. Thanks a lot, man.

2005
02:18:12,000 --> 02:18:13,000
Take care. Bye.

2006
02:18:13,000 --> 02:18:14,000
Yeah, bye.

2007
02:18:14,000 --> 02:18:17,000
Let's see. TigerColladChat over at live.vognetwork.com says,

2008
02:18:17,000 --> 02:18:20,000
If someone called Sky's favorite game a shit game, the claws will come out.

2009
02:18:20,000 --> 02:18:23,000
Hey, what did the guy before us say about Mass Effect, huh?

2010
02:18:23,000 --> 02:18:26,000
I know he doesn't call it that.

2011
02:18:26,000 --> 02:18:30,000
And as I said, different people are into different types of things,

2012
02:18:30,000 --> 02:18:33,000
and not everybody's going to be into Mass Effect, and that's okay.

2013
02:18:33,000 --> 02:18:36,000
Shit, I didn't get Mass Effect at first.

2014
02:18:36,000 --> 02:18:39,000
I had to approach it kind of with a different perspective,

2015
02:18:39,000 --> 02:18:45,000
and even my own evolutions as a gamer from 2007 when that series first came out

2016
02:18:45,000 --> 02:18:50,000
to, what was it, probably 2012 or, God, the years just all fucking blurred together at some point,

2017
02:18:50,000 --> 02:18:54,000
2012 when I finally did approach the series and give it another go, you know what I mean?

2018
02:18:54,000 --> 02:18:56,000
So, yeah.

2019
02:18:56,000 --> 02:19:01,000
ActAftonChat says, Black Wolf doesn't call it shit. He calls it crap.

2020
02:19:01,000 --> 02:19:03,000
Remember, it's a family show. Yes.

2021
02:19:03,000 --> 02:19:05,000
I'm teasing him. I'm teasing him.

2022
02:19:05,000 --> 02:19:11,000
But, you know, there's probably games that he's into that I'm not as into, and that's okay.

2023
02:19:11,000 --> 02:19:17,000
If everybody had the exact same opinion all the time, the world would probably be a little bit more boring.

2024
02:19:17,000 --> 02:19:21,000
Any last minute stories we want to get to? Loki?

2025
02:19:21,000 --> 02:19:23,000
No?

2026
02:19:23,000 --> 02:19:27,000
Wow. All right. I guess it was a little bit slower of a news week.

2027
02:19:27,000 --> 02:19:32,000
Now that the new console launched, E3 is still a couple months away.

2028
02:19:32,000 --> 02:19:35,000
Are there still tickets available for E3?

2029
02:19:35,000 --> 02:19:40,000
They were still available as of a week or two ago, and that really surprised me.

2030
02:19:40,000 --> 02:19:51,000
But I guess it's just so expensive and so forth that people are not going to it because it's in the middle of the week or what have you.

2031
02:19:51,000 --> 02:19:54,000
Or maybe, who knows?

2032
02:19:54,000 --> 02:20:00,000
Let's see. In chat over at live.vognetwork.com, Bobby Black Wolf in chat says,

2033
02:20:00,000 --> 02:20:05,000
I'm going to tweet on Tuesday about how much I don't care about Mass Effect because people need to know.

2034
02:20:05,000 --> 02:20:11,000
Actually, you know what's interesting about that, Bobby, is that I probably won't see that tweet because I won't be reading tweets.

2035
02:20:11,000 --> 02:20:13,000
I won't be playing Mass Effect.

2036
02:20:13,000 --> 02:20:18,000
While I'm at work, I won't be playing Mass Effect. But then when I get home, I'm going to go straight to Mass Effect.

2037
02:20:18,000 --> 02:20:28,000
Clearly, I'm very tired, and I should just take this lack of calls and this dinner being placed in front of me as a sign that maybe we should wrap up the show.

2038
02:20:28,000 --> 02:20:31,000
Let's see. A couple other comments here in chat mentioned here.

2039
02:20:31,000 --> 02:20:34,000
Bobby is also saying E3 is turning away industry people, too.

2040
02:20:34,000 --> 02:20:42,000
Yeah, a lot of podcasters and smaller journalistic sites that I know of not getting in the way they were before

2041
02:20:42,000 --> 02:20:46,000
because now ESA expects them to pay a couple hundred bucks to do it.

2042
02:20:46,000 --> 02:20:51,000
So it will be interesting to see what that changed coverage is going to look like.

2043
02:20:51,000 --> 02:20:57,000
As the show on 100 Mountain wants to know what's for dinner, Chipotle, did you bring enough for the class? No.

2044
02:20:57,000 --> 02:21:04,000
All right. Well, I guess I'll take this lack of phone calls as a sign. We're going to wrap it up.

2045
02:21:04,000 --> 02:21:07,000
But you can always email us if you were too shy to call tonight.

2046
02:21:07,000 --> 02:21:10,000
Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to send us an email.

2047
02:21:10,000 --> 02:21:14,000
That's going to do it, though, for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

2048
02:21:14,000 --> 02:21:19,000
Thank you guys so much for tuning into our show, and if you liked what you heard here at Orange Lounge Radio,

2049
02:21:19,000 --> 02:21:22,000
please don't forget to tell a friend or five about the show.

2050
02:21:22,000 --> 02:21:25,000
Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice,

2051
02:21:25,000 --> 02:21:30,000
but if those voices aren't out there, we can't put them out there, so come have them join us.

2052
02:21:30,000 --> 02:21:36,000
A nice five-star review on a place like iTunes or what have you goes an awful long way as well, so we really appreciate that.

2053
02:21:36,000 --> 02:21:40,000
We shall go around now and get everybody's final thought for the night.

2054
02:21:40,000 --> 02:21:43,000
Dark Soccer, your final thought?

2055
02:21:43,000 --> 02:21:47,000
I have been chatting with someone who I don't know who they are,

2056
02:21:47,000 --> 02:21:52,000
and I don't even know adding them to my friends list, so I'm totally removing them.

2057
02:21:52,000 --> 02:21:54,000
And also, resist.

2058
02:21:54,000 --> 02:21:59,000
Okay. All right. My final thought tonight is, mmm, steak.

2059
02:21:59,000 --> 02:22:01,000
And, Loki, last but not least, your final thought?

2060
02:22:01,000 --> 02:22:04,000
I have to go back to my regular job this week.

2061
02:22:04,000 --> 02:22:09,000
Aww. Oh, that breakout job? Is it still going? I would have thought that would have been a really long-term thing.

2062
02:22:09,000 --> 02:22:10,000
It's only six weeks.

2063
02:22:10,000 --> 02:22:12,000
Oh, wow. Time flies.

2064
02:22:12,000 --> 02:22:13,000
Yeah, time does fly.

2065
02:22:13,000 --> 02:22:15,000
All right. Well, enjoy what's left of it.

2066
02:22:15,000 --> 02:22:18,000
Until the next time, we'll see you in seven days,

2067
02:22:18,000 --> 02:22:24,000
and certainly next week we're going to hear what Dark Soccer and I have to say about Mass Effect Andromeda,

2068
02:22:24,000 --> 02:22:27,000
as well as you guys out there, and whatever else might be happening in gaming.

2069
02:22:27,000 --> 02:22:31,000
I know Loki doesn't really care about Mass Effect the same way we do.

2070
02:22:31,000 --> 02:22:32,000
Nope. Do not care.

2071
02:22:32,000 --> 02:22:36,000
Well, then you play something else, and let us... Play Rocket League, for fuck's sake.

2072
02:22:36,000 --> 02:22:38,000
Spend five minutes with that game and tell us what you thought about it.

2073
02:22:38,000 --> 02:22:43,000
Never wants me to play Overwatch on PC, but I don't think this laptop runs Overwatch.

2074
02:22:43,000 --> 02:22:45,000
There you go. Overwatch would be a good one.

2075
02:22:45,000 --> 02:22:46,000
It doesn't run in...

2076
02:22:46,000 --> 02:22:49,000
I think Orisa's hitting the feeds this week.

2077
02:22:49,000 --> 02:22:51,000
This won't run Overwatch.

2078
02:22:51,000 --> 02:22:52,000
That sucks.

2079
02:22:52,000 --> 02:22:54,000
But it may have to get a new computer.

2080
02:22:54,000 --> 02:22:57,000
All right. Well, that's going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

2081
02:22:57,000 --> 02:23:00,000
We'll see you in seven days. Have a good one, everybody. Take care.

2082
02:23:00,000 --> 02:23:03,000
You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
