This week, Harmonix officially announces its next release, DropMix, allows anyone to bring out their inner mashup artist and create the amalgamation they always wanted. This is just one of tonight's stories, so stay tuned for so much more, starting right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.

00:28.000 --> 00:31.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:32.000 --> 00:46.000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio. Live tonight, episode number 679 of our show for this March the 12th of 2017.

00:46.000 --> 01:02.000
My name is Rob Roberts, joining you live from Studio N7 in Sacramento, California, where we're live every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com, 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show. I hope you all made it back here with the time change.

01:03.000 --> 01:12.000
I also hate that whole losing an hour of sleep with daylight savings time as much as the rest of you do, but I'm not going to lie, the hour of daylight is nice. It is still light in the OLR studio.

01:12.000 --> 01:15.000
I've just taken one hour of your life. How does it feel?

01:16.000 --> 01:20.000
Surprisingly, Dark Sakura has not turned to ash with all the daylight in the studio.

01:21.000 --> 01:33.000
You want to know what's funny? I even drove with the windows down and the sun blaring on my freshly washed purple hair and listening to Lady Gaga. I still have perfect illusion in my head because I was singing with it.

01:34.000 --> 01:35.000
Sure, sure. Get on with your bad self.

01:36.000 --> 01:39.000
With what voice I have because I actually have enough voice to attempt to sing today.

01:39.000 --> 01:50.000
I know you're still kind of plagueish, but you sound just fine. You sound recovered even though I know you're still having treatment for that sinus infection from hell or whatever it is you've been going through.

01:51.000 --> 02:05.000
I still hurt, but I'm feeling remarkably better. My voice just wears out still quickly, so I've been preserving my voice, drinking warm things, and apparently I have a legit Stroopwafel, which I freaking love legit Stroopwafels.

02:05.000 --> 02:19.000
Yes, our guest tonight actually brought Stroopwafel to the show, and this is hilarious. So I was talking about it on Twitter, and I got followed by the official, or I don't know if it's official or whatever, it's some redistributor of all these Stroopwafel products.

02:20.000 --> 02:27.000
I mean, they're overseas, so it costs an arm and a leg to actually have them sent over here. But yeah, it's just funny, which by the way, we're going to get to an email.

02:28.000 --> 02:33.000
We're going to get to an email tonight that may blow your mind. We may have been saying Stroopwafel wrong this whole time.

02:33.000 --> 02:34.000
Stroopwafel?

02:34.000 --> 02:37.000
Yeah, we're going to get to that later in the email segment, so we'll get to that later.

02:37.000 --> 02:38.000
But it's Stroopwafel.

02:38.000 --> 02:47.000
We'll see, we'll see. I'll leave you with that teaser. Anyway, this episode of OLR is brought to you by The Dark. Also, we're sitting in the dark tonight. We don't have our usual light on because it's kind of warm in here.

02:48.000 --> 02:50.000
It's 76 degrees outside.

02:50.000 --> 02:59.000
Yeah. When did summer show up? Like we went from like three weeks of nonstop rain where I thought we would have to build an arc in order to do OLR and then suddenly it's like, hi, summer showed up.

03:00.000 --> 03:03.000
So anyway, but global warming, not a thing. Just so you know, Dark Sakura. Anyway.

03:04.000 --> 03:05.000
I will say this.

03:05.000 --> 03:06.000
What? Then I got to introduce the other guy.

03:07.000 --> 03:13.000
And eating the Stroopwafel. Sweet things still taste like soap to me. However, the aftertaste is delicious Stroopwafel.

03:14.000 --> 03:15.000
There you go.

03:15.000 --> 03:29.000
So I am quite pleased that yes, I do have a very large amount of dove taste in my mouth and not the delicious pigeon type bird that people would eat in the Victorian era when they were poor.

03:31.000 --> 03:35.000
But it is delicious and the texture is amazing. I love Stroopwafel.

03:36.000 --> 03:45.000
I'm being yelled at by chatters. Hi, chat over in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com. Again, Sunday nights live after Bobby Blackwolf at the Voicegeeks Network, vognetwork.com.

03:46.000 --> 03:56.000
Rama in chat says, fuck your summer weather. We got a nor'easter blowing down my door. Yeah, I heard. Meanwhile, while we're trying to deal with the heat, like they're saying like 18 inches of snow, which I guess is a lot.

03:56.000 --> 04:07.000
I mean, like you just put flakes here in California and works and schools close everywhere. But 18 inches of snow, I guess in the middle of, I hope I'm getting that right, in the middle of New York.

04:08.000 --> 04:16.000
Which sounds right, though, because I remember a couple years ago was when I went to PAX East, right? And PAX East was this weekend, right?

04:16.000 --> 04:28.000
And there was still like Boston was having their hell snowmageddon thing going on, which is probably every year. But this was like bigger than most the last time I was at PAX East. So this still this still sounds right to me. Anyway.

04:29.000 --> 04:43.000
In mobile, yeah, one year. I mean, it will snow like every so often, like an inch. But people treat it like it's a freaking hurricane. Actually, they treat it worse than it's a hurricane. You can find no bread in the store. You have to live on hot dog buns.

04:44.000 --> 04:55.000
All right. Well, look here to rock you like a hurricane. Say hello to Techmaster Loki. Hello. Hi, Loki. How are you? I'm fine. Yeah, good. Good. You didn't bring food to the show tonight. I was shocked. I was like, what's going on here?

04:56.000 --> 05:11.000
That's because I diet. No, I know I was making Irish stew. So I had just finished cooking at about five. So I just didn't have time to like I was cooking it for a while. So I was like, I'm just gonna cook.

05:11.000 --> 05:23.000
Yeah, I do that all the time. Nice. I Irish stew. Does that mean lots of bacon and Guinness and Irish stew? It's just potatoes and carrots. And you can put Guinness in the. No, no, no.

05:24.000 --> 05:35.000
When I made it, we did Guinness in the broth. He probably wants his kid. I mean, I guess alcohol cooks out, but he still probably wants. No, it's not like a beer broths, you know, stew or anything. That's just straight up, you know, onions, carrots.

05:35.000 --> 05:46.000
And I usually put like celery in there as well. And garlic, even though it doesn't call for garlic crock pot, you got to get one more crock pot meal in before winter's officially over. Basically, it was a crock pot on the stove.

05:47.000 --> 05:59.000
So did that. And then, of course, on top of that, we recommend it is that you also make an a herb butter that you can pour over the potatoes. So I poured that over. It was fucking. You should you should have a cooking show on YouTube.

05:59.000 --> 06:08.000
I think you would know, I would think people out there would not guess that Loki like cooks like this. And you would I think you do very well with the cooking show recipes.

06:09.000 --> 06:23.000
Except I didn't measure anything. Cooking with Loki. It's not that hard. It's not just follow the recipes. God. That would be the show is that Loki is having to supervise someone else cooking and Loki just gets very angry like follow the recipe.

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
That would be a lot of fun.

06:27.000 --> 06:31.000
You know that there is a channel that's cooking with Cooking Mama.

06:32.000 --> 06:33.000
Really?

06:34.000 --> 06:42.000
Yeah. And that's actually what gave me the inspiration that to make pizza because I watched him make pizza and it looked actually kind of good. So I made pizza.

06:43.000 --> 06:44.000
Is that a is that a Twitch thing?

06:45.000 --> 06:46.000
No, it's on YouTube.

06:47.000 --> 06:51.000
OK, because I know Twitch has the whole cooking section now, too, or at least eating. If they have eating, they surely have cooking.

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
I think you should do. Well, I can make a channel based on that. That's easy.

06:54.000 --> 06:55.000
There you go. There you go.

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
It'll be entitled like each episode. Special K again.

06:59.000 --> 07:00.000
OK.

07:01.000 --> 07:02.000
Some days I don't want to make anything.

07:03.000 --> 07:09.000
I think you should do something like the walk with Jan where you have like an apron that's got a different like bacon pun on it.

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
But his raw like walk puns like walk on the wild side.

07:14.000 --> 07:15.000
I like it. Do you remember that show?

07:16.000 --> 07:17.000
It's long.

07:18.000 --> 07:19.000
Jan can cook that one? Yeah, Jan can cook.

07:19.000 --> 07:20.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

07:21.000 --> 07:24.000
Maybe it was called something else, but it was like Martin Yan was his name.

07:25.000 --> 07:29.000
Yeah, he's got a he had a few different shows on PBS. I only remember Yan can cook, but he had other ones.

07:30.000 --> 07:33.000
He also had like a restaurant, I thought, or like a chain of restaurants or something.

07:34.000 --> 07:37.000
I never saw more Food Network in my life than the years I lived with Loki.

07:38.000 --> 07:39.000
I said my mom, the Martin Yan cookbook.

07:40.000 --> 07:43.000
Of course, Food Network game works. You don't have cable, but you know.

07:44.000 --> 07:45.000
Well, these are the pre Netflix days, too.

07:46.000 --> 07:47.000
So, you know, it was Food Network and Chill.

07:47.000 --> 07:48.000
It wasn't Netflix and Chill.

07:49.000 --> 07:50.000
It was like Food Network can get hungry.

07:51.000 --> 07:54.000
All right, I got to introduce our guest here tonight.

07:55.000 --> 07:56.000
Oh, very, very familiar voice on the show.

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
It's been probably been at least a month or two since we've heard from him.

08:00.000 --> 08:01.000
But welcome back to the show tonight, JD.

08:02.000 --> 08:03.000
Hi.

08:04.000 --> 08:05.000
Hi, JD. How are you doing?

08:06.000 --> 08:07.000
I'm pretty good.

08:08.000 --> 08:09.000
Yeah, good. Good to have you back. How are you doing?

08:10.000 --> 08:11.000
Don't forget to get that microphone nice and close so we can hear you.

08:12.000 --> 08:13.000
Otherwise, it's a struggle.

08:14.000 --> 08:15.000
I'm doing pretty well.

08:15.000 --> 08:16.000
I appreciate that.

08:17.000 --> 08:18.000
Great. I'm glad you like him.

08:19.000 --> 08:20.000
So JD actually didn't bring the Stroopwafel with him.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.000
He had it shipped here from. Did you get it on Amazon?

08:23.000 --> 08:24.000
I got it on Amazon.

08:25.000 --> 08:31.000
So which is funny because that's not the first time in 2017 Stroopwafel has magically shown up at my doorstep.

08:32.000 --> 08:33.000
Not that this is a trend I'm upset with at all.

08:34.000 --> 08:39.000
I mean, like, you know, we don't beg for donations or T-shirt sales or anything like that here on OLR.

08:40.000 --> 08:41.000
I mean, we really should, but we don't.

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
But if you want to pay us a Stroopwafel, I really can't complain.

08:45.000 --> 08:55.000
So, I mean, cool. But so this box shows up on my doorstep, but it has my stage name on it because you all know Rob Roberts is my real name, but it's just the name I've had online for years and years.

08:56.000 --> 09:03.000
So it has my stage name on it. And I'm like, okay, somebody sent something to the house that knows my address, but doesn't know my real name.

09:04.000 --> 09:09.000
And so I opened it up and I, you know, first, you know, Alan's like, well, is it ticking?

09:10.000 --> 09:14.000
No, it's not. So I went ahead and opened it up and I saw what it was, but there was no packing slip.

09:15.000 --> 09:18.000
There was nothing in there besides the Stroopwafel to let me know who sent it.

09:19.000 --> 09:23.000
I just forgot to mark it as a gift because I assumed that Amazon would say who it was from.

09:24.000 --> 09:29.000
So no, it didn't. So I had to like write this tweet, like, well, thanks for whoever sent the Stroopwafel.

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
I have no idea who you are. And then when you showed up, you were like, oh yeah, it was me.

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
For all I know, you're just taking credit for it. No, I'm kidding. I'm kidding.

09:36.000 --> 09:37.000
Well, I know you're a man of your wood.

09:38.000 --> 09:41.000
I know you're a man of your wood. You have the receipts. Good, good.

09:42.000 --> 09:43.000
So what's new with you?

09:44.000 --> 09:45.000
Not a whole lot.

09:46.000 --> 09:50.000
Any adventures to arcades lately? You told me, since it is a video game show, we should get off food and get on video games for a minute.

09:51.000 --> 09:53.000
You've been traveling around to Bay Area arcades, right?

09:54.000 --> 09:58.000
Yeah, so Dave and Buster's recently opened up, maybe like just in the next city south of me.

09:59.000 --> 10:03.000
So I've been going there fairly regularly and they have the latest DDR version, Ace.

10:04.000 --> 10:08.000
So I got myself an EMU's card and I've been tracking scores and it's been fun.

10:09.000 --> 10:11.000
Yeah, but they don't really have any other music based games.

10:11.000 --> 10:12.000
They have grand piano keys.

10:13.000 --> 10:16.000
That's the ticket spinning game? I rule at that game. I love grand piano keys.

10:17.000 --> 10:26.000
When they first set it up, it was right next to the DDR machine, so the two of them are almost competing because two music games next to each other is a problem sometimes.

10:27.000 --> 10:30.000
But then they moved it the next time I was there and now it's a giant Pac-Man.

10:31.000 --> 10:36.000
I feel like my whole life playing Beatmania type games prepared me to win a lot of tickets and grand piano keys.

10:36.000 --> 10:46.000
If you haven't seen grand piano keys, you guys, it's this giant oversized piano that you would imagine a 7-year-old would just go crazy banging on the keys because it's like this gigantic keyboard.

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
And they do, and so forth. But you're supposed to follow the notes on the screen.

10:50.000 --> 10:55.000
Well, you know what? It's also fun to be a 38-year-old banging on these gigantic keys.

10:56.000 --> 11:00.000
It's really relaxing. You can go at your own tempo. The key to doing it is...

11:01.000 --> 11:02.000
No, you gotta go fast. Gotta go fast.

11:03.000 --> 11:04.000
Well, that's what I mean.

11:04.000 --> 11:05.000
Do you want tickets?

11:06.000 --> 11:10.000
You know, you have to read the notes and stuff, but it's not like a timing game like most of the music games that we play.

11:11.000 --> 11:17.000
Akuma JP says, like, the big movie. No, but it's not one with your feet. See, when you think of big, you think of the one with your feet.

11:18.000 --> 11:23.000
This one's more elevated, like you're sitting at a piano bench. It's a lovely concert you're going to and you sit at the piano bench.

11:24.000 --> 11:25.000
But would you say that the keys are comically large?

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
Yeah, there's only four of them and it's huge.

11:29.000 --> 11:30.000
Hilariously large.

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
So, yes. Yeah, there's only like four keys on the keyboard.

11:33.000 --> 11:34.000
Four keys per player.

11:35.000 --> 11:37.000
Oh, well that's just easy. You just need two doubles, right?

11:38.000 --> 11:39.000
I know, right? Yeah.

11:40.000 --> 11:41.000
Come on, I grew up on seven keys.

11:42.000 --> 11:43.000
Four?

11:44.000 --> 11:45.000
This thing dropped it down to four. This is for babies.

11:46.000 --> 11:47.000
If they had a doubles, I would be playing it.

11:48.000 --> 11:49.000
I know, they need the doubles mode. It'd be awesome.

11:50.000 --> 11:54.000
Anyway, I'm glad to hear you're having fun still touring the arcades in the Bay Area.

11:55.000 --> 11:56.000
I have to check out this Dave & Buster's that's new.

11:56.000 --> 12:00.000
I always only knew the one in Milpitas as far as Bay Area is concerned.

12:01.000 --> 12:03.000
And then they built the one here in Roseville, which is sad.

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
It's a sad Dave & Buster's. It's small.

12:07.000 --> 12:11.000
You can go to the Dave & Buster's because it's in Daly City and then you can go to the Steak & Shake, which is almost next door.

12:12.000 --> 12:16.000
Fuck yes, that's great. Steak & Shake is still a novelty to us here in California.

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
That Daly City one is the first one in California, right?

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
I haven't had Steak & Shake, but I like Steak and I like Shake.

12:23.000 --> 12:24.000
It's all about the banana chocolate combo.

12:24.000 --> 12:28.000
It's also, temper your expectations, it's not actual steak. It's a steak burger.

12:29.000 --> 12:30.000
Steak burger, yeah. I'm fine with steak burger.

12:31.000 --> 12:32.000
But they're good and they have amazing onion rings.

12:33.000 --> 12:34.000
I go there for Chili Mac.

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
God, food with you people all the fucking time.

12:38.000 --> 12:39.000
We gotta get into video games because that's what we're here to talk about.

12:40.000 --> 12:45.000
Video games, gamer culture, and the gamer lifestyle every Sunday night live with you guys at vognetwork.com.

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
Kick off topic tonight, start things off.

12:49.000 --> 12:53.000
I want to talk a little bit about a company that's been in the news a lot this week.

12:54.000 --> 13:00.000
A lot. And this is something that's really been shifting gaming culture quite a bit over the years.

13:01.000 --> 13:02.000
And that is Twitch.

13:03.000 --> 13:07.000
I don't know if you guys realize, Twitch has been in the news a lot this week.

13:08.000 --> 13:12.000
So last week we talked about the whole fact that they were going to start selling games.

13:13.000 --> 13:14.000
That was a big shift for Twitch.

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
But it's also, it's totally logical.

13:18.000 --> 13:23.000
And even though we kind of, I voiced my concern with the system is that only these larger streamers are getting rewarded.

13:24.000 --> 13:25.000
The smaller streamers aren't.

13:26.000 --> 13:29.000
I do still feel like there's time for Twitch to kind of hear all that and process that.

13:30.000 --> 13:31.000
And we'll see what ultimately comes of that.

13:32.000 --> 13:33.000
I'm not taking any of that as like the final word.

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
But then there was a lot more that came out on Twitch this week.

13:37.000 --> 13:43.000
For example, I'm going to start with something a little more negative because this is really unfortunate.

13:44.000 --> 13:49.000
But you guys may have heard of the marathon streamer who is streaming on Twitch who passed away in the middle of his stream.

13:49.000 --> 13:53.000
He was 22 hours into his 24 hour charity stream and he passed away.

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
And I'm not here to joke or make light of that situation.

13:57.000 --> 13:58.000
It's really awful.

13:59.000 --> 14:06.000
But the unfortunate thing is the way we kind of obsess with media or what have you, this type of news information gains a lot of speed.

14:07.000 --> 14:13.000
And it gets a lot of re-blogs and so forth that like, OMG this guy passed away while he was doing a marathon.

14:13.000 --> 14:20.000
Well it kind of, it also kind of blows the situation out of proportion because my understanding is the guy had stepped away to have a cigarette.

14:21.000 --> 14:25.000
And that's when he passed out and ultimately passed away.

14:26.000 --> 14:32.000
And I apologize, I don't have the source in front of me, but I think it was heart related complications probably from staying up for so long.

14:33.000 --> 14:39.000
And potentially, I don't know, but potentially having just pre-existing health things that maybe were coming into play here.

14:39.000 --> 14:44.000
And I'm thinking if he stepped away to have a cigarette, he probably felt something was coming on.

14:45.000 --> 14:50.000
So my point is, thank God it didn't happen on camera because people are sick and you know, but anyway.

14:51.000 --> 14:54.000
So despite the fact that that's not such a good thing, it's a very bad thing.

14:55.000 --> 15:03.000
It's gaining a lot of traction and clicks and people are realizing like wow, a lot of people watch this Twitch stuff that happens live.

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
And they are there to watch the unexpected moments.

15:06.000 --> 15:15.000
Obviously that is not an unexpected moment you're tuning in for, but you know, just the, on a lighter note, the sillier things that happen, the unexpected moment.

15:16.000 --> 15:24.000
Which, this didn't happen on Twitch per se, but a perfect example of something that very well could have happened on Twitch was that guy that was on the BBC or something doing a live interview.

15:25.000 --> 15:28.000
And then his kid comes in through the door and you know, is like crashing the interview, right?

15:29.000 --> 15:32.000
That video is everywhere this week, right? Because people like to see when things go wrong.

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
And that kind of stuff happens on Twitch like all the time, right?

15:36.000 --> 15:37.000
That whole type of thing.

15:38.000 --> 15:48.000
Anyway, this is causing Twitch to show up in the mass media, like NPR did a whole little feature on Twitch this week, you know.

15:49.000 --> 15:56.000
And even though I think we as gamers and folks that consume gaming media on the regular, we're all very familiar with Twitch.

15:56.000 --> 16:08.000
Well, let me ask this. How much do you watch Twitch or other, when I say Twitch, my umbrella that encompasses Beam, YouTube, Live, and the other stuff too.

16:09.000 --> 16:13.000
How much do you do the streaming? Yes. How much do you watch that stuff? Dark Soccer, do you watch that stuff?

16:14.000 --> 16:15.000
Not at all.

16:16.000 --> 16:17.000
Really?

16:18.000 --> 16:19.000
No, not really.

16:20.000 --> 16:21.000
But you guys do YouTubes, don't you?

16:22.000 --> 16:25.000
No, but I'm going to be starting it up. Dan and I are talking about basically just recording us arguing while playing games.

16:26.000 --> 16:29.000
Well, people said they'd listen to it, so whatever. I've streamed though.

16:30.000 --> 16:31.000
Yeah.

16:32.000 --> 16:37.000
I'll pick a game that I'm like, okay, this game is WTF worthy. Like, I did the entirety of Hot to Full Boyfriend.

16:38.000 --> 16:43.000
And now, yes, I dated Pigeons and played the final scenario.

16:44.000 --> 16:45.000
Oh, I have all the achievements.

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
Took four hours. Oh my god, but it was great and fucked up.

16:49.000 --> 16:50.000
I wanted a sequel.

16:50.000 --> 16:58.000
Well, there's the other ones. There's Holiday Star, and then there's a couple others, which I have now, and I'm planning on doing Holiday Star next.

16:59.000 --> 17:03.000
So I will stream, but sometimes it's kind of boring for me to watch other people's streams.

17:04.000 --> 17:11.000
And I don't like to listen to people talk over games. It's just annoying to me. I would rather enjoy the game.

17:12.000 --> 17:15.000
So I will look for long plays on YouTube instead.

17:16.000 --> 17:17.000
Ah, okay.

17:17.000 --> 17:21.000
Unless it's like, play along with me, and then they want your input.

17:22.000 --> 17:26.000
And some people like having you talk to them. I guess that's okay.

17:27.000 --> 17:33.000
When I stream, I talk and I interact with the listeners, but I'll tell you my pet peeve. This is what I don't do.

17:34.000 --> 17:37.000
My pet peeve is reading dialogue boxes in silly voices.

17:38.000 --> 17:39.000
Yeah, that's annoying.

17:40.000 --> 17:44.000
But however, I'm not shading you if you do do that because I know other people that love that.

17:45.000 --> 17:46.000
I know other people that love that.

17:47.000 --> 17:48.000
I just, I don't.

17:49.000 --> 17:54.000
I think Markiplier is annoying. He is, you know, maybe an okay person.

17:55.000 --> 18:00.000
He's got a nice voice. I loved his Five Nights at Freddy's one because those were meant to be entertaining.

18:01.000 --> 18:04.000
But I don't really like many of his other videos, and I don't find them really that funny.

18:05.000 --> 18:08.000
I've only seen one video of his. I don't know the guy to be able to say anything positive or negative.

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
If he's doing charity streams, then that's positive.

18:12.000 --> 18:13.000
Yeah, I'm okay with charity.

18:14.000 --> 18:23.000
So, but like, the ones that I think are really entertaining are the ones that add something to the game.

18:24.000 --> 18:29.000
You know, ones that are an interactive element but not overshadowing the game.

18:30.000 --> 18:34.000
It's not necessarily about the player. You are a part of the experience.

18:35.000 --> 18:38.000
And they are there to bring you into the experience in a way you wouldn't normally be.

18:38.000 --> 18:44.000
So that is kind of where I am about those streams. I don't know if I'm the only person in this room that feels that way.

18:45.000 --> 18:54.000
I don't really watch Twitch, although more recently I have been watching a little bit of it just because of my day job, which is ironic.

18:55.000 --> 18:58.000
But I haven't even really watched too much of that.

18:59.000 --> 19:03.000
Preferably, I normally watch stuff on YouTube, but not even live stuff. It's more rebroadcast.

19:03.000 --> 19:11.000
The most you'll see me watching actual streams would be kind of like, Awesome Games Done Quick rebroadcasts, or the archives of those.

19:12.000 --> 19:23.000
So I'll watch those occasionally, and I'll watch like, occasionally, I forget the guy's actual name, but he goes by CarlSagan42 on YouTube.

19:24.000 --> 19:31.000
He does a lot of the very technical Mario Maker levels. He also speedruns Mario games and stuff like that.

19:31.000 --> 19:39.000
So I don't remember the guy's actual name though. But I watch him. He's pretty entertaining. Although I haven't been watching him pretty lately.

19:40.000 --> 19:41.000
But, I don't know.

19:42.000 --> 19:51.000
I like those things too. When it adds to the experience of the game. Like, when they're explaining what they're doing in a speedrun, or like you're doing talking about the technical aspects of it.

19:51.000 --> 20:01.000
Well it's great because he'll play through the levels, and then at the very end when he's like, he'll figure, like you're kind of watching with him and he's figuring it all out, then he'll just break the world record for it.

20:02.000 --> 20:08.000
Because that's what he doesn't. Like he just speedruns the solely technical level and gets the world record for each one of them. Just kind of funny.

20:09.000 --> 20:16.000
I guess I must watch much more of the livestream stuff than you do. I find, you know, I probably watch more of it at this point than I do Netflix, to be honest.

20:16.000 --> 20:28.000
Like, you know, especially if I'm just kind of bored and hanging out on the couch, I'll fire up the Playstation 4. Especially if friends of mine are broadcasting. I'm ten times more likely to watch, like if a friend of mine is live, I'll just go tune into the stream.

20:29.000 --> 20:33.000
Because it's kind of like you're hanging out with a friend long distance, right? That's kind of what this show is in a way.

20:34.000 --> 20:42.000
I would love to do more streaming if it wasn't going to totally annoy my wife because, you know, I'd be talking and so it'd be interrupting whatever she's doing.

20:42.000 --> 20:47.000
But if I had my own room that was soundproof that I could actually do that, then hell yeah I'd do that.

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
We need the Nelly commentary Twitch channel.

20:51.000 --> 20:53.000
No we don't. Actually, I don't think we do.

20:54.000 --> 21:05.000
Well, obviously I enjoy doing the livestreaming more and more, but I've been watching more and more too and I actually have been dipping in more and more often to strangers and people that I don't recognize.

21:05.000 --> 21:15.000
Just because none of my friends are streaming and so I just want to watch somebody play Overwatch or something and maybe it's somebody, sometimes I even watch streams that aren't in English.

21:16.000 --> 21:23.000
Like just to kind of hear the voiceovers and dubs in another language and just to hear and just kind of see competition around the world I think is really interesting to me.

21:24.000 --> 21:31.000
So I've been watching more of it than I was probably a few years ago. In fact, I would think I probably was one of the people in the very beginning that was like,

21:31.000 --> 21:38.000
who wants to watch somebody else play a video game? I'm sure you can probably go back to old OLRs and hear me saying that, but opinions evolve, they change.

21:39.000 --> 21:44.000
As more and more people get in there and do things with it, you start to see the other sides of it at the end of the day.

21:45.000 --> 21:47.000
So I think I came full circle and I really became a fan of the whole thing.

21:48.000 --> 21:58.000
But it's just interesting how much more mainstream stuff that now Twitch is starting to get with, they have this whole NPR thing as well.

21:58.000 --> 22:09.000
Sorry, I'm reading in chat over at live.vognetwork.com. Dungeonbuster in chat says it's hard though, not all streamers are as entertaining to me, but their gameplay can also be great background noise, especially if they're playing something obscure.

22:10.000 --> 22:24.000
Bobby Blackwolf in chat, who you might remember, used to host a show called Friday Night Gaming that was, in a way, really ahead of its time because that show was playing live video games and doing the show over it, but this was before Twitch had really taken off.

22:24.000 --> 22:28.000
I think Justin TV was still on, but Twitch hadn't really taken off yet.

22:29.000 --> 22:36.000
So Blackwolf says, I got told that all the time, that's why Friday Night Gaming got cancelled. Nobody wanted to watch other people play video games on the internet on a Friday night.

22:37.000 --> 22:41.000
The store didn't want anything to do with it, nobody wanted to be the one playing, and only a couple dozen people watched online.

22:42.000 --> 22:49.000
So it's like it was one of those things where it was an idea ahead of its time, and I'm not sure what finally made that take off.

22:49.000 --> 22:59.000
I don't know, I don't know if it just became, as Bobby you were kind of mentioning as you scrolled up, you only need a quarter of the software today than you needed back then.

23:00.000 --> 23:14.000
Maybe the technology and the fact that it's so easy for anyone to do so that it can be instead of strange people that I don't know on the internet at all doing it, it's like my friends and people that I know from great distances are doing it, maybe that helped break down the walls.

23:14.000 --> 23:23.000
Well yeah, and also the equipment, because before you used to have to have a capture card and all the software and a PC running set up to do all the streaming and everything, and now these consoles have it built in.

23:24.000 --> 23:25.000
That's very true, some of them.

23:26.000 --> 23:27.000
Well all the modern consoles do.

23:28.000 --> 23:29.000
The Switch doesn't yet.

23:30.000 --> 23:31.000
Like I said, all the modern consoles do.

23:32.000 --> 23:44.000
But it's very easy to set up the Switch on streaming, I'm going to stream on the Nintendo Switch after tonight's show, so it's not impossible to do. Getting the Wii U set up was harder, honestly.

23:45.000 --> 23:46.000
I have to completely derail us for a second.

23:47.000 --> 23:48.000
Uh oh.

23:49.000 --> 23:56.000
I went looking on eBay for a game that I wanted my collection, and I found something. I linked it to you. I linked it in the chat room.

23:57.000 --> 23:58.000
What is this?

23:59.000 --> 24:00.000
Who's got $79,000 handy?

24:01.000 --> 24:04.000
$79,000? What is it? Is it a sealed copy of Stadium Events or something?

24:05.000 --> 24:06.000
Uh, it might be included.

24:07.000 --> 24:18.000
Okay, what is this? So on eBay, massive huge video game mega collection, 122 console systems, plus 3 coin ops. What the heck?

24:19.000 --> 24:20.000
60 peripherals and 3 coin ops.

24:21.000 --> 24:23.000
Somebody's cleaning house. Okay, but it's being sold out of Italy.

24:24.000 --> 24:25.000
Yeah, but still.

24:26.000 --> 24:27.000
That's going to be way too much shipping.

24:28.000 --> 24:29.000
50 bucks. But still.

24:29.000 --> 24:33.000
I mean, if you have $79,000, 50 bucks of shipping isn't going to make that much of a difference.

24:34.000 --> 24:35.000
Jeez Louise.

24:36.000 --> 24:44.000
Yeah, I figured that was worth a momentary derailment for. I maybe have half of that, and the other systems in there are a lot of European systems, too.

24:45.000 --> 24:49.000
Boy, I wonder why somebody would completely gut their collection like that, or maybe it's a game store that's gone under.

24:50.000 --> 24:53.000
Oh, there are multiples? It actually looks like it was a library. They have an XI there.

24:54.000 --> 24:57.000
If you wanted to start some retro game store, though, here's all you need to get started.

24:57.000 --> 25:09.000
It looks like a few special edition systems to Japanese Saturn and American Saturn. Yeah, there are multiple versions of the system, just different iterations of it.

25:10.000 --> 25:15.000
Including a DDR second mix for Dreamcast, which I have.

25:16.000 --> 25:20.000
You'd be set to stream for life if you bought this thing. But anyway, back to streaming for a minute.

25:21.000 --> 25:24.000
No, that's okay. JD, what's your take on streaming? Do you participate with it?

25:24.000 --> 25:33.000
I haven't really gotten into it. Mostly, I mean, I don't find myself with all that much free time sometimes, and usually I'm like, well, if I have time, I could be playing games or I could be watching them.

25:34.000 --> 25:37.000
And I usually just fall on the side of playing them, because I have so many games in my backlog.

25:38.000 --> 25:49.000
I guess I didn't realize I was the only one that was really participating in that stuff on the regular. Well, something might bring you guys into the fold soon enough. Who knows?

25:49.000 --> 26:01.000
Anyway, something else that Twitch has launched somewhat recently is Twitch IRL, which the NPR article also got into was talking about how now people stream real life stuff on Twitch, which is hilarious.

26:02.000 --> 26:12.000
Because, of course, those of us that were around when Justin.TV was around saw this go the other way, that Justin.TV was set up to be an IRL thing, that then the video game section really took off and Twitch kind of dominated the conversation.

26:12.000 --> 26:26.000
They ended up essentially closing Justin.TV, although I know when they first launched IRL, they really tried to set out, here's the differences between the two, but come on, it's still kind of funny in a way to see the IRL lead to Twitch lead back to IRL.

26:27.000 --> 26:31.000
I just thought that was interesting. Well, anyhow, there's still other news about Twitch and what's going on.

26:32.000 --> 26:42.000
Twitch also streams IRL programs. Like, they had the Bob Ross thing not that long ago, right? And that was awesome. Did you guys not watch the Bob Ross thing?

26:43.000 --> 26:44.000
I did not watch the Bob Ross, but it sounded awesome.

26:45.000 --> 26:47.000
I used to watch Bob Ross when he was on PBS, so I've probably seen them all.

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
I watch Bob Ross on Netflix nowadays.

26:50.000 --> 27:02.000
But it's something else to say, you know, like when Bob Ross is going, I'm going to beat the devil out of that brush, I'm just going to beat the devil out of that brush, to see the chat light up going, devil wrecked, RIP devil, devil get fucked, you know, all this stuff.

27:03.000 --> 27:06.000
You know, because along the nice things that Bob Ross does.

27:07.000 --> 27:15.000
Well, Twitch is going to be hosting, get this, a 17-day marathon of the Power Rangers. Is Shane out there from Ranger Pride?

27:15.000 --> 27:24.000
Surely, and he watches more streaming than I do. I'm sure he's aware of this and Captain Spike over there at Ranger Pride, but they're going to be doing a 17-day marathon of the Power Rangers.

27:25.000 --> 27:32.000
It's going to start on March 15th, run through the 30th, 23 seasons and 831 episodes of 19 different television series.

27:33.000 --> 27:40.000
The whole thing, I think, is supposed to be a lead up into the movie, of course, which they're, aren't there like Krispy Kreme Power Rangers donuts at this point?

27:41.000 --> 27:42.000
Like, they're really trying to get the marketing out there for the Power Rangers.

27:43.000 --> 27:44.000
So the movie was already out.

27:45.000 --> 27:48.000
The 24th is when the movie, there's like a new movie, are you aware?

27:49.000 --> 27:51.000
Yeah, the new live action one, but I thought that came out back in January.

27:52.000 --> 27:57.000
No, trailer did, but the movie's finally going to be here just a couple weeks, so that's a pretty big deal.

27:58.000 --> 28:03.000
So yeah, that is something you can check out there. That's going to be on the Twitch Presents channel.

28:04.000 --> 28:11.000
That's going to be part of Twitch's monthly subscription offering, but if you're an Amazon Prime person, which a lot of you are, you're going to just have that built in.

28:11.000 --> 28:17.000
So, let's see, going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com, Bobby Blackwolf says,

28:18.000 --> 28:24.000
The Bob Ross chat room was the only time I enjoyed watching Twitch chat just because I thought the spamming was hilarious.

28:25.000 --> 28:32.000
Yeah, during that Bob Ross thing, it was hilarious. There is a lot of toxic stuff that happens sometimes in Twitch chat.

28:32.000 --> 28:36.000
For example, chicken in chat says more like racist ranges.

28:37.000 --> 28:44.000
But I gotta say, I was actually, I was just watching Twitch over the weekend, actually.

28:45.000 --> 28:52.000
And I was watching a streamer I was not familiar with at all, and I don't even remember his name, but I know he was overseas because he had an accent, and he was playing Overwatch.

28:53.000 --> 28:59.000
And somebody, I didn't watch, I wasn't watching the chat, but somebody I think was acting up in his chat and saying like nasty things.

28:59.000 --> 29:05.000
But I thought it was really cool that this dude bro-ish guy shut it down.

29:06.000 --> 29:11.000
Like he said, come on dude, that's not cool, don't say that kind of stuff or you can't hang out here.

29:12.000 --> 29:19.000
I want this to be a positive place. And I was like, is this the internet that I know? Is this the Twitter view?

29:20.000 --> 29:25.000
So, I have to applaud people on Twitch that don't put up with that shit.

29:25.000 --> 29:35.000
And if you don't make a space for it and you let them know that that type of racist shit is not welcome here, then I think that's awesome that people are doing that.

29:36.000 --> 29:46.000
And that just helps Twitch in the long run to get that bullshit out of their community, which is why a lot of people, not to get too off topic, but it's why a lot of people are still very frustrated with Twitter.

29:47.000 --> 29:54.000
Because Twitter doesn't really take that same type of action against people that it probably needs to take action against.

29:55.000 --> 30:03.000
I digress. Anyway, let's see. Dungeon Buster says, was it Flame Hopper? He's like a super positive streamer that plays H1Z1.

30:04.000 --> 30:08.000
I honest to God don't remember the guy's name, but he was playing Overwatch and I think he plays Overwatch a lot.

30:09.000 --> 30:15.000
I think that's like his bread and butter is that. Because he kept talking about how he usually streams competitive mode, but this particular day he wasn't.

30:16.000 --> 30:19.000
He was streaming just quick plays. So, I thought that was really cool.

30:19.000 --> 30:26.000
Anyway, so as if all that was enough, that's not the rest of the news. So, there's more stuff that Twitch was doing into this week.

30:27.000 --> 30:34.000
So, Twitch is going to be launching, funny enough as I just said that Twitter can't seem to take a lot of the garbage out of it.

30:35.000 --> 30:43.000
Twitch is going to launch a type of Twitter competitor. It's called Pulse. It's going to be a feed that updates photos, images, text from Twitch users.

30:43.000 --> 30:50.000
Which essentially is going to be for people probably plugging their upcoming streams or maybe discussing gaming and so forth.

30:51.000 --> 30:54.000
But it's going to be interesting to see how this IRL spin is going to be on it.

30:55.000 --> 30:58.000
I don't think everybody is in Pulse yet. I think it's something they're slowly rolling out to people.

30:59.000 --> 31:04.000
But it definitely seems like Twitch wants to go for some of that Facebook or Twitter money.

31:05.000 --> 31:10.000
What do you guys think about Twitch trying to get into that whole social feed element?

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
How long before they duplicate Snapchat?

31:13.000 --> 31:17.000
Yeah, how long before they duplicate, right? No, that's Facebook that keeps ripping off Snapchat at every angle.

31:18.000 --> 31:22.000
Loki, do you think Twitch has an opportunity to take a bite out of Twitter and Facebook and all that?

31:23.000 --> 31:24.000
They can definitely try.

31:27.000 --> 31:31.000
Tigerclaw points out in chat, I believe Twitch has an automod thing to help moderate the chat. That is true.

31:32.000 --> 31:36.000
You can choose how strong or soft you want that automod to be.

31:36.000 --> 31:42.000
But you're right, I forgot about that. There is an automod system on there that is on, I think, a medium level by default.

31:43.000 --> 31:49.000
So to get rid of the most garbage comments, but if you still want to have a little rough chat, you can have it.

31:50.000 --> 31:55.000
Also, then there's Pulse, which we'll see what impact that has as it starts to roll out more.

31:56.000 --> 32:01.000
And then, if you guys forgot, Twitch picked up Curse not that long ago.

32:01.000 --> 32:06.000
Which, if you've played World of Warcraft in the past, you're probably aware of Curse because they did a lot of automods.

32:07.000 --> 32:10.000
Darkstalker, do you use any of the Curse stuff to install your mods, or do you do it all by hand?

32:11.000 --> 32:12.000
Yeah, I use Curse for all of my mods.

32:13.000 --> 32:14.000
Well, I don't know if you know, but that's Twitch program now.

32:15.000 --> 32:16.000
Yeah, I know.

32:17.000 --> 32:19.000
So, coming out very soon, a rebranding of Curse, it's going to be...

32:20.000 --> 32:21.000
They've already replaced the app.

32:22.000 --> 32:23.000
Oh, have they replaced it with all their branding?

32:24.000 --> 32:27.000
Yeah, they've already replaced it with all of the Twitch stuff, and honestly, it works far better than it did before.

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
Instead of having to pay for Curse Premium, it just works.

32:31.000 --> 32:34.000
The official launch of the Twitch desktop app is going to be March 16th.

32:35.000 --> 32:40.000
And so, now you hear this whole Twitch is trying to get into buying and selling the games directly.

32:41.000 --> 32:43.000
Twitch is getting into trying to replace Facebook.

32:44.000 --> 32:48.000
Twitch is already on the desktops of most World of Warcraft players, which is one of the biggest PC games out there.

32:49.000 --> 32:54.000
You really start to see how Twitch is trying to get a lot more than just, come watch what we're doing.

32:54.000 --> 33:00.000
Out of curiosity, Dark Soccer, since I haven't played WoW in a while, and Fallout SE 14 doesn't support add-ons, so Curse doesn't really use it,

33:01.000 --> 33:04.000
does this Twitch app now try to encourage you to watch live feeds while you're on it too?

33:05.000 --> 33:06.000
No.

33:07.000 --> 33:09.000
Oh, interesting. I bet it will. It's going to be interesting if that's coming.

33:10.000 --> 33:13.000
I just always keep up the add-on manager, so I never see it.

33:14.000 --> 33:19.000
Interesting. Bobby Blackwolf in chat points out the Twitch desktop is going after Discord with that Apple.

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
It seems like everybody wants a piece of Slack right now.

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
Discord's freaking annoying.

33:25.000 --> 33:29.000
Everybody wants a piece of that Slack right now. It's not just Discord, but it's Slack.

33:30.000 --> 33:34.000
Google split Hangouts this week, right? Or they're going to be.

33:35.000 --> 33:40.000
Hangouts is going to have their whole video component, but then their text component is basically going to be Google Slack.

33:41.000 --> 33:45.000
Microsoft's got a Slack competitor they're working on as well. That's the whole new thing.

33:45.000 --> 33:52.000
Slack is basically the IRC thing that you guys are participating with at live.vog.net.com.

33:53.000 --> 34:01.000
Slack is just a modern version of IRC that has more support for when you paste in a link, it automatically shows you what the preview is.

34:02.000 --> 34:05.000
You can insert photos in natively. It's a more modern version of IRC.

34:06.000 --> 34:11.000
I'm in some ways kind of surprised. We here at VOG haven't tried to.

34:11.000 --> 34:17.000
Well, actually, somebody asked me about that point blank once. Why haven't we tried to go to something like Slack?

34:18.000 --> 34:23.000
A, that costs money. B, it's also harder to integrate. Something like Slack, you have to invite people to.

34:24.000 --> 34:30.000
The nice thing about live.vog.net.com, it's built right into that page. You go, you sign in, you can use it.

34:31.000 --> 34:35.000
If you misbehave, Bobby Banhammer Blackwolf will make sure you don't get to get in there again.

34:35.000 --> 34:42.000
But it's built into the website very easy to get into. Where as Slack and Discord even, you kind of have to invite people.

34:43.000 --> 34:45.000
Well, Discord has links.

34:46.000 --> 34:51.000
But again, it's not really something that's built into websites, but I don't know.

34:52.000 --> 34:59.000
With Slack, it's built with the workplace paradigm, so you have to trust everyone you invite. There's no abuse controls, so it can get out of hand a lot easier.

34:59.000 --> 35:06.000
Yeah. Interesting. Bobby's perspective over at live.vog.net.com. Slack was started as the chat engine for an MMO.

35:07.000 --> 35:15.000
The MMO died, but they learned the chat engine was marketable. Yeah. Or even IRC. I mean, do a lot of people still use IRC?

35:16.000 --> 35:22.000
I think so. I think IRC is still popular with a lot of, especially more tech-savvy communities, I think are still kind of built in IRC.

35:23.000 --> 35:24.000
What is our chat room running on?

35:25.000 --> 35:26.000
No, I know, I know, but I'm outside of us.

35:27.000 --> 35:28.000
Oh, well, we offer some things.

35:29.000 --> 35:32.000
I've been using it since probably 2000 and, you know, off and on.

35:33.000 --> 35:40.000
Yeah. I know, I know I used to use it a lot in college, but now it's really just vog stuff is really all I use it for.

35:41.000 --> 35:42.000
I still keep up with my LiveJournal people on IRC.

35:43.000 --> 35:44.000
Do you really? Yep.

35:45.000 --> 35:46.000
I guess it's hard to let some things go, isn't it?

35:47.000 --> 35:53.000
Because the LiveJournal, the fact that you're even still hanging with LiveJournal people says something because that website kind of...

35:54.000 --> 35:57.000
Well, I mean, I don't use that site anymore, but the people are still around.

35:57.000 --> 36:01.000
Yeah. And Tiger Claw in chat says, but it won't be long until we see vog on Curse or Discord.

36:02.000 --> 36:08.000
No, no, no, I'm not saying anything like that is happening. I am saying that other people have asked me why we haven't gone that way.

36:09.000 --> 36:12.000
And usually I'll just kind of, you know, that's not my department. Bobby does the tech stuff.

36:13.000 --> 36:18.000
But no, but I also, I know very well the whole reason Slack wasn't going to work was the fact that we didn't want to have to invite people.

36:19.000 --> 36:22.000
We wanted it to be an open door. That was a big barrier for the whole Slack thing.

36:22.000 --> 36:31.000
So, I mean, I'm not going to say we're never going to go that direction, but there's going to have to be a compelling argument for us to fix something that's not broken.

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
Does that make sense? IRC and this whole thing, it's not broken.

36:35.000 --> 36:38.000
So there has to be a compelling argument to evolve that, if that makes sense.

36:39.000 --> 36:43.000
So anyway, yeah, I'm curious. Why do you dislike Discord, DarkSakura? I use it.

36:44.000 --> 36:47.000
I hate it out of spite for all of those times I want to raid.

36:47.000 --> 36:52.000
And it says, must have Discord. Fuck you. I don't want to talk to any of you people.

36:53.000 --> 36:55.000
That's not Discord's problem. That's the community's problem.

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
And the fact that they rely on Discord for all of it.

36:59.000 --> 37:01.000
I see. It's annoying. I don't want to be pigeonholed into it.

37:02.000 --> 37:09.000
But all these people just, when I was playing, not even two years ago, it was Team Speaker Ventrilo. Just replace Discord with Team Speaker.

37:10.000 --> 37:13.000
Why? Because it was easier. I liked it better. And I'm old fashioned.

37:13.000 --> 37:21.000
No, the thing is, I just hate that it's become a requirement for so many things. Especially when my voice wasn't working.

37:22.000 --> 37:25.000
Okay. No, I get that. So it's a different...

37:26.000 --> 37:27.000
I hate the dependence on it.

37:28.000 --> 37:33.000
Okay, so it's not the software you have a problem with. It's what a crutch it's become for some people, I suppose.

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
Yeah, exactly. And they only want it to be voice chat.

37:36.000 --> 37:42.000
And I'm like, you can just as well type in the raid chat as you can in whatever their chat is.

37:43.000 --> 37:51.000
Well, and without going too far down this alley, but I know this is an issue. Some girls don't like to get on voice chat.

37:52.000 --> 38:03.000
Because, especially if it's strangers, some guys are trash when they hear a girl. Not all. Some become instant trash when they hear a girl get on the chat. Right? Am I right?

38:03.000 --> 38:11.000
Yeah, but I'll tell you what is funny. We had a raid a couple weeks ago that was probably 70% women.

38:12.000 --> 38:22.000
And this one guy just started being a shit and everyone just went off on him. It was like that lioness photo where they all attacked the lion. And then we booted him out.

38:23.000 --> 38:26.000
So there's no room for that in my life.

38:27.000 --> 38:29.000
Behave yourself, boys and girls. But everybody behave yourself.

38:30.000 --> 38:31.000
The future is female.

38:33.000 --> 38:39.000
Alright. Let's see. I'm looking in chat over at live.fognetwork.com.

38:40.000 --> 38:46.000
Bonds006 says, DarkSakura, these kids and their newfangled chat programs. Back in my day, Yahoo chat was all you need.

38:47.000 --> 38:48.000
I never used Yahoo chat.

38:49.000 --> 38:51.000
Aim. Aim for life. AOL instant messenger.

38:52.000 --> 38:53.000
ICQ.

38:54.000 --> 38:58.000
What about just the fucking AOL chat rooms? Not even aim.

38:59.000 --> 39:05.000
You know what's funny now is that when I went to what store? It was freaking 99 cent whatever store.

39:06.000 --> 39:13.000
When you would go pay for something, the little register thing would go, uh oh. And I'm like, it's the ICQ sound. Oh my god, it's followed me.

39:14.000 --> 39:27.000
Triggered by the past. I love it. Alright. Anyway, so yeah, I just wanted to kind of get into like, wow, Twitch has been in the press a lot lately and I want to talk a little bit about live streaming and what you guys all think of this.

39:28.000 --> 39:33.000
What this could be for the future of, you know, because Twitch is a pretty big part of the gaming community.

39:34.000 --> 39:40.000
And not, you know, I keep saying Twitch, Twitch, Twitch, Twitch. But we also know that YouTube clearly wants a piece of this.

39:41.000 --> 39:46.000
You know, they've tried to launch their thing. And this whole Microsoft Beam is kind of a wild card right now, I think.

39:47.000 --> 39:54.000
It depends how fast Microsoft kind of ramps that up. I'm very curious to see what they unveil at E3 that they might do with Beam.

39:54.000 --> 39:58.000
Because Beam has the whole thing where you get rewarded for participating. You get the little sparks.

39:59.000 --> 40:06.000
And usually that's just so you can play noises in other people's streams. Like, that's the only thing that people really thought to do with it yet. The, uh oh, you can play it in somebody's stream.

40:07.000 --> 40:15.000
But I'm sure there's going to be other things before too long that Beam wants to do because they're more about, like, especially the interactive games.

40:15.000 --> 40:20.000
They want to do more of that stuff too where it's like, it's not just dropping sounds, but you can actually control the game.

40:21.000 --> 40:25.000
And like maybe for a thousand sparks you could drop an enemy into somebody playing Dark Souls on Beam.

40:26.000 --> 40:35.000
So that is still kind of a wild card that's lurking. But that whole live stream thing is really like, I mean, even five years ago we were looking at the future of live streaming.

40:36.000 --> 40:42.000
And I feel like in some ways it's only just beginning. Because this was all about the shift for the gamers to get into it.

40:42.000 --> 40:47.000
But now you see the mainstream starting to get into it more and more too. It's going to be very interesting. Very interesting in the coming years.

40:48.000 --> 40:51.000
Any other thoughts on Twitch before we get into our gaming weeks? Streaming and all? Alright.

40:52.000 --> 40:59.000
Let's get into our gaming weeks. Every week we like to talk about the types of video games that we have been playing this week to set the stage for where our gamer brains are at.

41:00.000 --> 41:01.000
Dark Soccer, how was your gaming week?

41:01.000 --> 41:05.000
It's been mostly Breath of the Wild. Dan and I are doing kind of our co-playing thing.

41:08.000 --> 41:13.000
Because I basically just spot a lot more things while he might be focused on something else.

41:14.000 --> 41:17.000
So there's that. I've actually been playing a lot less WoW since we've been doing that.

41:18.000 --> 41:22.000
But they finally put out the last LFR for the Nighthold.

41:23.000 --> 41:26.000
So I did the Gul'dan raid and it's like, oh my god.

41:27.000 --> 41:35.000
Dear Tanks, there's a site called WoWhead. And if you've never done the fucking raid before, study it.

41:36.000 --> 41:39.000
There's also a channel that does raids in two minutes.

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
Maybe you should get on Discord and explain it to me.

41:43.000 --> 41:48.000
Girl, no. I ended up having done the fight before, just never finished it.

41:48.000 --> 41:51.000
Telling the Tank how to tank. And I don't tank.

41:52.000 --> 41:53.000
Maybe you should tank.

41:54.000 --> 41:58.000
No. I remember when I tried. For like a hot minute when I had Rebecca Black.

41:59.000 --> 42:02.000
Who was permanently at level 85 and is now my bank alt.

42:03.000 --> 42:06.000
But you only play her on Friday, Friday.

42:10.000 --> 42:13.000
My heart weeps. Don't cry for me Argentina.

42:13.000 --> 42:16.000
Now, you may have hurt Bobby's feelings in our chat.

42:17.000 --> 42:20.000
Bobby Blackwolf says, the anti-tank rant is why I quit Final Fantasy XIV.

42:21.000 --> 42:23.000
Because I was dumb and my first character was a tank.

42:24.000 --> 42:32.000
No, no, no. There's a difference between people criticizing your tanking style and going into a fight fully ignorant.

42:33.000 --> 42:35.000
Bobby would also listen to what anybody told him.

42:36.000 --> 42:37.000
Like if we said, Bobby do this. He'd be like, okay.

42:37.000 --> 42:46.000
Yeah. That's okay. If you take your feedback or if someone says, hey, try this instead. This mechanic's gonna happen. That's fine.

42:47.000 --> 42:53.000
The guy we had would not do anything that people suggested. Had no idea.

42:54.000 --> 43:00.000
And I'm like, finally I'm copying and pasting out of Wowhead. Tanks. This.

43:01.000 --> 43:02.000
And then we finish the fight.

43:03.000 --> 43:05.000
Congrats. GG. I'm beating it.

43:06.000 --> 43:07.000
Thank you.

43:08.000 --> 43:09.000
You're welcome.

43:10.000 --> 43:11.000
But, oh my God. Oh my God.

43:12.000 --> 43:13.000
Alright.

43:14.000 --> 43:17.000
Oh yeah. And I'm still kind of on best of move in Pokemon Go.

43:18.000 --> 43:21.000
Awesome. Let's go to Loki. How was your gaming week?

43:22.000 --> 43:28.000
I didn't really play that much this week. I've been having to actually program. So that's what I've been doing.

43:28.000 --> 43:33.000
But I did play a little bit of Skyrim and just the bare minimum of Pokemon Go.

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
And that's really it.

43:37.000 --> 43:38.000
That's it?

43:39.000 --> 43:40.000
Yeah.

43:41.000 --> 43:42.000
Alright. How about you, JD? How was your gaming week?

43:43.000 --> 43:48.000
Pretty good. I mean, the Switch is still new to me. So I've been playing a bit of Zelda. I've been playing some of the other games like Voice.

43:49.000 --> 43:54.000
And I bought Snipperclips. And that was a lot of fun to play around with.

43:55.000 --> 44:00.000
It's like two joy cons. And we only figured out the two player mode. But apparently it supports up to four.

44:01.000 --> 44:04.000
And that was a lot of fun. It's a cooperative puzzle game.

44:05.000 --> 44:09.000
I've also been playing with my 3DS a lot. I still take that back and forth to work with me.

44:10.000 --> 44:13.000
So I've been doing Street Passes and Rhythm Heaven Megamix.

44:15.000 --> 44:20.000
How do you enjoy, as a music game fan, how do you enjoy Voice? Do you think it's a good addition to the Switch?

44:21.000 --> 44:23.000
Or do you think it's kind of a cash in or what?

44:24.000 --> 44:29.000
I mean, I liked it. I've played a couple hours on it. Or maybe an hour or so. And it was alright.

44:30.000 --> 44:34.000
I tried it on my phone first because it's free there and I wanted to see if I would like it.

44:35.000 --> 44:39.000
And comparing my Android with the Switch, I was impressed by the size of the screen.

44:40.000 --> 44:44.000
I'm like, this makes a touchscreen music game a lot easier because you have more room to maneuver around with.

44:45.000 --> 44:51.000
I liked it. I don't know any of the songs. And for music games, that's often a bonus if you know stuff.

44:51.000 --> 44:56.000
But I like the soundtrack well enough. The play style seems great.

44:59.000 --> 45:03.000
We tried the first couple and it was really easy. And the difficulty definitely scales up.

45:04.000 --> 45:08.000
Yeah, well you figure the easy level first few songs are going to certainly be easy.

45:09.000 --> 45:14.000
And also you have the luxury of, you've played a lot of music games so a lot of it just kind of comes naturally to you.

45:15.000 --> 45:19.000
Like, tap here when this happens. Okay, well I've played Elite Beat Agents before. I'm already a leg up, right?

45:19.000 --> 45:25.000
Yeah. Cool. So you're enjoying the Nintendo Switch overall? You didn't own a Wii U, right?

45:26.000 --> 45:30.000
I bought a Wii U in January because I'm like, if I'm going to get one at all, it needs to happen.

45:31.000 --> 45:33.000
Oh, you wanted one before they were gone for good. Got it.

45:34.000 --> 45:36.000
Because there are still Wii U exclusive games that I wanted to have.

45:37.000 --> 45:38.000
For now.

45:39.000 --> 45:40.000
Well, okay.

45:41.000 --> 45:43.000
For all you know, Mario Maker will show up on 3DS. Well, Mario Maker's already on 3DS.

45:44.000 --> 45:47.000
It did show up on 3DS, but on Switch and all that stuff before too long.

45:47.000 --> 45:54.000
Yeah, but I mean, the Wii U I got also because there were a couple of Wii games I didn't find, so it made it really easy to buy those digitally as well.

45:55.000 --> 46:00.000
But yeah, I didn't manage to get a pre-order for Switch, so I waited six hours at Best Buy.

46:01.000 --> 46:02.000
Wow.

46:03.000 --> 46:04.000
I mean, that's better than a lot of people had to wait, so.

46:05.000 --> 46:07.000
And that was six hours in the Bay Area, which is where all the tech nerds are.

46:08.000 --> 46:13.000
In San Francisco, and it was like, I don't know, like 40 degrees out or something. It was cold that weekend.

46:14.000 --> 46:16.000
I had to get my husband to deliver me blankets and a burrito.

46:17.000 --> 46:19.000
Important stuff to get through the weekend.

46:20.000 --> 46:21.000
Yeah.

46:22.000 --> 46:23.000
But, well, you got your Switch though and all as well.

46:24.000 --> 46:25.000
Yeah.

46:26.000 --> 46:29.000
Good, good. Alright, let's see, my gaming week. So, I've also been playing quite a bit of Nintendo Switch.

46:30.000 --> 46:32.000
I mean, there's always still like, you know, the Final Fantasy XIV, the Overwatch as well.

46:33.000 --> 46:39.000
But, I was playing a little bit of Zelda earlier on in the week, but then I actually kind of started to drift away from that for a little bit.

46:40.000 --> 46:44.000
I mean, nothing's wrong with Zelda. It's still a great game, but it's just like, oh, this console plays other games too.

46:44.000 --> 46:50.000
I started playing Shovel Knight. I said I was not going to buy Shovel Knight. I swore a banana wasn't going to buy Shovel Knight.

46:51.000 --> 46:57.000
And then I was like, maybe I'll just buy it again. I'll get the Treasure Trove, because it has the Plague of Shadows and all the other stuff.

46:58.000 --> 47:06.000
I'll just buy it again. So, I might own Shovel Knight on as many platforms as I own Mass Effect 3 on now. I might be at that point.

47:07.000 --> 47:10.000
But at least Shovel Knight is awesome, just like Mass Effect 3. So, I was playing some of that.

47:11.000 --> 47:17.000
And then on Friday, a game that I was really anticipating on the Switch came out, and that is Blaster Master Zero.

47:18.000 --> 47:24.000
And I really tried to temper my expectations, because you might remember there was Blaster Master Overdrive, I think it was called on the Wii.

47:25.000 --> 47:32.000
And it was okay. I didn't hate Blaster Master Overdrive, but it didn't really capture the magic of the original, and I think a lot of that was just like,

47:33.000 --> 47:38.000
I think some of the physics was kind of reinvented, and so it felt a little clunkier than the original did.

47:38.000 --> 47:44.000
Something felt off the whole time I played Overdrive, and it wasn't bad, but it was weird.

47:45.000 --> 47:52.000
So, I was kind of expecting to go through something similar with Blaster Master Zero, but I have to confess, I really like Blaster Master Zero.

47:53.000 --> 47:59.000
I like it a lot, and it really brings back a lot of the spirit of the original Blaster Master.

48:00.000 --> 48:04.000
So, here's the thing, because people are wondering, is this a remake? Is this a sequel? What the hell are they doing here?

48:04.000 --> 48:13.000
Here's the thing, Blaster Master Zero is to Blaster Master on the NES, what Metroid Zero was to Metroid on the NES.

48:14.000 --> 48:20.000
So, it's like the first part of the game is pretty much the same, but then you start to get into other levels, and different things start happening.

48:21.000 --> 48:27.000
There's more bosses, there's slight differences to the level, like Area 2, they completely changed the setup for it.

48:28.000 --> 48:33.000
They make it a housing area or something like that, whereas in the NES version, it was like another swampy area or something.

48:34.000 --> 48:40.000
They changed things very subtle like that, but I noticed you still kind of go through a very similar progression with items and so on.

48:41.000 --> 48:49.000
So, yeah, that's kind of the best way I can describe it. If you have played Blaster Master on the NES, Blaster Master Zero is kind of like what they did with Metroid Zero.

48:50.000 --> 48:54.000
However, some other things they've added, some huge quality of life improvements from the original.

48:55.000 --> 49:00.000
You now have the ability to save your game, you have restart points, you don't have lives anymore.

49:00.000 --> 49:05.000
You just have restart points that once you cross it, you can restart from that point, and you have maps.

49:06.000 --> 49:10.000
You can use a map, and so it actually feels a lot more like Metroid, which the original kind of did.

49:11.000 --> 49:23.000
Maybe the only thing I could say that actually is kind of surprising me about Blaster Master Zero so far that may get it some backlash or whatever is that it's pretty darn easy.

49:23.000 --> 49:35.000
Like, it's really easy. Actually, I have not really had a struggle in anything until I hit the part of the game where it's like you have to time a jump just right to land on a ladder.

49:36.000 --> 49:42.000
And that part of the game was actually really infuriating me because it's like, God, the rest of the game has been so fucking easy right up to this point.

49:43.000 --> 49:48.000
But I think part of the reason why Blaster Master Zero is a lot easier is A, those two quality of life changes I just talked about,

49:48.000 --> 49:55.000
and B, the fact that your gun is way easier to power up than it was in the original, and it does different stuff.

49:56.000 --> 50:03.000
In the original, when you powered up your gun, it kind of changed the shape and things like that, and it was cool. You could get it really strong.

50:04.000 --> 50:13.000
But in this one, as your gun powers up, you get a charge shot, an auto shot, a flame thrower, and then you get this super powerful wave beam that just cuts through walls.

50:13.000 --> 50:25.000
And if you can hang on to that, it's really easy. Because in the original Blaster Master, every time you took damage, not only did your health go down by one, but your gun power went down by one.

50:26.000 --> 50:32.000
In this one, that is still the case, but the gun power ups are handed out like candy, so it's really easy to get back up to eight.

50:32.000 --> 50:43.000
And then you get an item really early on that's like a shell, like spoiler alert, but it's not a big deal, it's like a shell for your gun meter that basically you can get hit one time without losing any gun power.

50:44.000 --> 50:51.000
And that shell regenerates after like 30 seconds. So it's like you're allowed to make one fuck up every 30 seconds so you don't lose gun power.

50:52.000 --> 51:01.000
And so it really makes the game a lot easier than the original. But you know what? I'm not as good at video games as I was when I was nine when the original Blaster Master came out.

51:02.000 --> 51:11.000
There's a part of me that actually kind of appreciates the scale down and difficulty. Now I don't know if maybe a harder mode is going to open up when I beat it or something. I'm not through the whole game yet. I'm up to area five.

51:12.000 --> 51:19.000
But I'm not sure where that's all going to go. But yeah, I'm just really enjoying the game from a nostalgia standpoint.

51:20.000 --> 51:31.000
And I think the thing that's important to note too is that it's only $10. Which for games nowadays, especially like launch titles on a new console, that's really pretty darn reasonable.

51:32.000 --> 51:38.000
So that's great. Because that's how much virtual console games would cost almost in some cases. So I'm glad to hear about that.

51:39.000 --> 51:47.000
TigerConChat asks, does the new Blaster Master game use the story about the boy and his frog? Because it wouldn't be Blaster Master if it wasn't about that.

51:48.000 --> 51:55.000
Here's the thing about that. Yes it does. It does use that story. But it goes a little further with it. Here's the crazy part.

51:56.000 --> 52:04.000
So do you guys remember, years ago, there used to be a bunch of books that were written on NES video games. It was the Worlds of Power books.

52:05.000 --> 52:13.000
And they did one on like Castlevania, Simon's Quest, and there was Ninja Gaiden. And there was all these different games that they did the books on.

52:14.000 --> 52:23.000
So they did a book for Blaster Master. Well, that book introduced a character into the universe called Eve. Eve is in the game.

52:23.000 --> 52:33.000
So I don't think it's the first time she's appeared. I think she showed up in either the Wii one or the Game Boy one they did a long time ago.

52:34.000 --> 52:45.000
So I don't think it's the first time Eve has shown up. But it's still neat to me that this character that was created in a book that was totally a side story that wasn't really part of canon, kind of became canon.

52:45.000 --> 52:55.000
So I thought that was really cool that they did that. So Eve is now a character in the game. I'm not going to spoil much more than that, like why she's there or anything like that, but you will see that.

52:56.000 --> 52:58.000
So I think that's kind of cool that the books inspired that.

52:59.000 --> 53:03.000
So, Stoppy in chat says the book is canon. Yeah, I guess it is now.

53:03.000 --> 53:16.000
And Dark Tetsuya points out, to be fair, that wasn't even in the Japanese original. That was all the US Division's idea. Yeah, the whole frog thing, the boy losing his frog, that was not in the Japanese original because they localized that like years later.

53:17.000 --> 53:23.000
Yeah, Stoppy points out Eve was in the PS1 Blaster Master. That's what it was. But I just think it's funny that she shows up here too.

53:24.000 --> 53:29.000
Anyhow, I really enjoyed Blaster Master Zero and I would recommend it. And Shovel Knight is a good game too.

53:29.000 --> 53:37.000
Okay, but I will talk about one game that I didn't really care for. And I'm sorry, JD, because it's a game that you brought over, but you already know how I feel about this.

53:38.000 --> 53:49.000
And that is, I did not enjoy that new Bomberman game at all. And that's probably because I don't really, like, I kind of think the Bomberman franchise is kind of overhyped.

53:49.000 --> 53:58.000
Like, as far as classic games go. Like, everybody's got something, right? So, if you are thinking I'm crazy by saying that, then you're probably going to just feel different by nature about Bomberman Zero.

53:59.000 --> 54:06.000
But, you know, Shane was really trying to tell me I should get Bomberman Zero. I want to get Bomberman Zero. We can play multiplayer. But I was like, no, I don't really care for Bomberman.

54:07.000 --> 54:14.000
And I don't know what this game is going to do to make it any better. And it doesn't, like, the controls feel, like, JD, is it just me? The controls feel kind of sluggish in that game.

54:14.000 --> 54:17.000
No, I think you're right. Like, I noticed, like, it felt a little weird.

54:18.000 --> 54:19.000
Yeah, there is something patching that out, too.

54:20.000 --> 54:31.000
Well, I don't think it's a delay thing, because I was noticing that, just, like, with a regular controller, also, it was, like, it just, something about, I mean, it feels kind of silly to say physics in a 2D top-down game, but it feels like the physics are off.

54:32.000 --> 54:35.000
And the voice acting is super annoying.

54:36.000 --> 54:40.000
Oh, it's hilarious. Like, especially as you play as Aqua and you start winning, and, yeah, no, it's funny.

54:40.000 --> 55:02.000
Okay, so I was playing as the Black Bomberman, because this thing I saw on Twitter made him look hilarious. And as you are circling around the outside, because when, okay, that was one thing I thought was kind of a neat little change on the formula, was that when you get knocked out in Bomberman, you revive on the edge of the plat field, and you can fire bombs as a ghost into the, back into the field, and if you knock somebody else out, you take their place.

55:03.000 --> 55:04.000
Yeah, Revenge has been around for a couple of...

55:05.000 --> 55:07.000
Oh, has it? That shows you how often I've been playing these games.

55:07.000 --> 55:08.000
Yeah.

55:09.000 --> 55:18.000
So anyway, so, okay, so the Revenge thing is there, but every time you fire a bomb as the Black Bomberman, take that! Take that! Take that! And I'm like, shut up!

55:19.000 --> 55:23.000
All of the characters give a line when they throw a bomb as Revenge, and that is kind of annoying.

55:24.000 --> 55:31.000
Yeah, so I'm just, I'm not hearing, I'm not feeling the Bomberman game, but if you guys are enjoying it, good for you. Hooray.

55:31.000 --> 55:35.000
But yeah, I'm glad I didn't spend the money on that, but there's other great Switch games to check out.

55:36.000 --> 55:42.000
Zelda, Zelda, Zelda, Zelda, and, you know, Barman, or Bla, Barman, Blaster Master Zero I think is great,

55:43.000 --> 55:49.000
and Shovel Knight, of course, if for some reason you've missed Shovel Knight until now, that's a great game too.

55:50.000 --> 55:53.000
I still haven't had my hands on 1-2 Switch yet, I'll probably get there eventually.

55:54.000 --> 55:57.000
And then what, next week we're going to have Binding of Isaac, a new version of that is out on the Wii U.

55:57.000 --> 56:05.000
Get your systems together, Rob, on the Switch, so that'll be really exciting too. Cool!

56:06.000 --> 56:13.000
Tigerclaw in chat says, Sky, maybe the character should have said bombs away, bombs away, bombs away.

56:14.000 --> 56:15.000
I mean, there are eight characters.

56:16.000 --> 56:22.000
One of them probably does. Anyhow, that's my gaming week. That's enough, I've gone on long enough.

56:22.000 --> 56:28.000
So, housekeeping tonight, I don't have a lot, except I do want to promote for sure, Sac Indie Arcade is coming up,

56:29.000 --> 56:33.000
it's coming up on April the 8th, we're going to be broadcasting all day from the West Sacramento Convention Center,

56:34.000 --> 56:38.000
if you are in Northern California, I highly encourage you to make the drive and check it out.

56:39.000 --> 56:41.000
Sac Indie Arcade is going to be a lot of fun, we'll be there live all day.

56:42.000 --> 56:46.000
This time I'll go to all of the rooms instead of realizing there was an extra room they didn't go to at the very end.

56:46.000 --> 56:53.000
Yes, and I'm hoping we might have extra help this year so that we don't have to be at the table 24-7 so that we can actually go play some more of the games.

56:54.000 --> 56:56.000
That'll be very exciting, so that'll be cool.

56:57.000 --> 56:59.000
Dan will be running the Atari Party table again too.

57:00.000 --> 57:03.000
Oh, so Atari Party is making a cameo again, that's great. Atari Party was fun.

57:04.000 --> 57:07.000
So, it's not just indie games, but kind of a celebration of other gaming too.

57:08.000 --> 57:12.000
I will definitely make sure we get Gabe and Brie back on the show before that day if they are available,

57:12.000 --> 57:17.000
so we can talk all about what to expect at this year's Indie Arcade, because I know they have all new speakers, it's going to be a good time.

57:18.000 --> 57:19.000
So, look forward to that.

57:20.000 --> 57:22.000
I do not know if we will end up having a show the next night.

57:23.000 --> 57:26.000
Something has come up where Jamie and I may have other obligations the very next night,

57:27.000 --> 57:31.000
and we figure if we are broadcasting all day long the day before, then perhaps we deserve a night off.

57:32.000 --> 57:37.000
So, more to come on that as we approach April, that would be April 9th would be the show date for that,

57:38.000 --> 57:39.000
we'll let you guys know as that gets closer.

57:39.000 --> 57:46.000
Anyhow, in the meantime, let's get into some gaming news and what's going on in gaming this week. Loki.

57:47.000 --> 57:54.000
Alright, so Nintendo talked a little bit about, hey, where the heck are those streaming services that are not on the Switch?

57:55.000 --> 58:02.000
And, well, they said that Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon will be coming in some time.

58:03.000 --> 58:12.000
And, you know, they basically said, you know, what they basically were saying is that their system is more of like about the games on the system.

58:13.000 --> 58:19.000
And then, of course, they're talking to other companies about bringing those services, because they said that they're not differentiators.

58:20.000 --> 58:25.000
What differentiates the Nintendo Switch is, you know, the games and how they're played.

58:26.000 --> 58:29.000
That sounds like a cop-out to me, if you really got to ask.

58:29.000 --> 58:34.000
I do think it's a bit of a cop-out, but it's one they can kind of get away with right now.

58:35.000 --> 58:40.000
Like, you know, there's enough stuff on the Switch right now, especially with how freaking good Zelda is,

58:41.000 --> 58:43.000
there's enough stuff on the Switch they can kind of get away with right now.

58:44.000 --> 58:50.000
So, it's, you know, and I think it's a great line, the whole, like, we just want the system to be about games.

58:51.000 --> 58:57.000
But I just can't believe that in their, you know, five-year plan for the system, their ten-year plan, however long they want the Switch to be viable,

58:57.000 --> 59:01.000
I just don't believe that they wouldn't try to ever bring in some of this other stuff.

59:02.000 --> 59:05.000
And again, I think it's just one of those things that will show up this holiday.

59:06.000 --> 59:10.000
And then, suddenly, and the reason why I bring this up, because I'm sure some of you guys, I'm not even looking at chat at the moment,

59:11.000 --> 59:13.000
I'm sure some of you guys are saying, yes, Rob, a gaming console should be about the games.

59:14.000 --> 59:22.000
Look, my point I'm making is that that line that they're saying right now is going to do a 180 this holiday when they do launch Netflix and that stuff.

59:22.000 --> 59:30.000
That's my point, is that it's just a convenient line right now for what they have available, but come holiday when they do have the rest of that stuff,

59:31.000 --> 59:38.000
they're going to say, well, not only did we want to be the best gaming system with the best games like Zelda and Splatoon 2, we wanted to bring you even more!

59:39.000 --> 59:40.000
And that's the thing, I'm calling it right now.

59:41.000 --> 59:48.000
It's not a differentiator. It actually is a differentiator, because you're launching with an online service that's not as robust as your competition. Period.

59:48.000 --> 59:55.000
That's how it is. And yes, your system is different in the way it plays games. That is also a differentiator.

59:56.000 --> 01:00:03.000
But you can't dismiss that this is not a differentiator, especially when, as you said, a few months from now, they're just going to fucking flip that line anyways.

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:08.000
It is. Just accept it, say yes, it'll come in time. That's it.

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:10.000
Which is essentially what he said.

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:14.000
Right. Pretty much. With the differentiator part added in there.

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:18.000
Stoppy in chat says, you don't think there's enough on the Switch? Wait till it gets hacked.

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:30.000
Look, here's the thing. It's not that I don't necessarily think there's enough on the Switch at this point, you know, especially, I mean, that was a pretty, for one week after launch, that was a pretty good week the Switch had last week.

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:36.000
I really enjoy Blaster Master Zero. JD says voice is worth it if you're a music game fan.

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:43.000
You had the Neo Geo games, which I'm surprised Dark Sakura hasn't kind of poked her head in, what's this? But you probably have the original Neo Geo games.

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:49.000
But that's available now on the Switch. What is it? World Heroes Champions is one of them. One of the Metal Slug games.

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:51.000
World Heroes is...

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:53.000
There's four or five games.

01:00:54.000 --> 01:01:02.000
All these indies and old titles can, you know, keep the Switch going, but it's going to take third party support aside from indies.

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:10.000
And that's what the major consoles have right now, except for the Switch. Doesn't it really have a lot of stuff coming out third party wise right now?

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:20.000
But here's my point. Here's my point. The week that the Switch just had this last week, the Wii U did not have a week like that one week after launch.

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:32.000
The Wii didn't have a week like that one week after launch. So if this is the trend for Nintendo is going to be pumping out like a pretty big, even if third party, indie, whatever it is,

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:45.000
if the Switch is able to pump out like a title at least worth turning your head at, and Nintendo's did a pretty good job with that news thing that it does seem to update in your sleep and it doesn't connect to the internet.

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:56.000
So it kind of lets you know right when you turn on the system, hey, this game is available. Nintendo may not have that whole problem with, oh gosh, there's no games available on it that they had with the Wii U.

01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:08.000
But the Wii U launched with a ton of titles. I bought a lot of those titles. So that's not really an argument. They launched with way more titles than the Switch. I don't remember what the Wii U had, but I know the Wii U had...

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:12.000
There was a bunch of crap that was on PS3 and Xbox already, except now it was the touchscreen.

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:20.000
This is true. They did have a lot of things like that, but that's what they're doing now with the Switch. It's stuff that was on the Wii U, but now it's on the Switch.

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:28.000
So it's the same thing, except now they just aren't releasing them right at day one. Instead they're saying, hey, look, it's coming out in April.

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:45.000
I literally watched their trailer for the whole Mario Kart 8 on the Switch, because it's a fucking Wii U title, and showing what the features are and the new differentiators as I use his line.

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:58.000
It's nothing. It's literally two characters and, oh shit, we put Battle Mode back in there because it fucking should have been in the first place. And now you get two items. Big fucking deal.

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:08.000
See, that's Loki's opinion, but I'm looking in chat over at live.voggenetware.com. A10 in chat is asking, are you going to get Mario Kart 8, Rob? Yes. I will rebuy it.

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:12.000
I'm hoping they don't try to pull the $60 price tag on it.

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:21.000
Oh, you bet your ass. You bet your ass that shit's gonna be fucking $60. We'll see. I'm betting all the DLC characters in that purchase.

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:32.000
I'm pretty sure they are, but it doesn't matter. I already bought it on Wii U. But I will rebuy it on the Switch to have it portable and to be able to play, because you'll get Mario Kart 8 as well, right, JD?

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:40.000
Yeah, I didn't actually get Mario Kart 8 for Wii U, because I just bought it recently, and I was like, well, I'll just wait until it comes out on the Switch, and the same with Splatoon.

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:44.000
But then when you come over and play Mario Kart 8, we'll both be able to play on our Switch. It'll be awesome.

01:03:45.000 --> 01:04:01.000
The other thing I have to admit was kind of neat about the Switch. Since JD did bring his system over, it was so easy and fucking convenient to want to play Bomberman, all we had to do was take my Switch out of the dock, put JD's in, Bomberman time. It was that easy.

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:05.000
So, I mean, actually, no, not with Bomberman, we just moved the cart.

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:09.000
Bomberman was a cartridge, so we just switched the game out for Snipperclips.

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:11.000
That was at Snipperclips.

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:13.000
Which is DLC only.

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:23.000
But still, that made it awfully convenient to show off another game or what have you. This is something that isn't as easy on PlayStation 4 or Xbox One, if you don't have it on disc.

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:27.000
And pairing the Joy-Cons was also really easy. All you have to do is just attach them to the console.

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:38.000
Yeah, for sure. Let's see, so, TigerClaw in chat says, is the new Mario Kart 8 going to have all the DLC from the Wii U version, and I mean stuff like playing as Link and some other Nintendo characters outside of Mario.

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:44.000
Yes, and I think it's going to have more, too, because it's going to have the Splatoon Kids and King Boo.

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.000
Well, the Splatoon Kids were in there already, I thought.

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:49.000
No, not the Splatoon Kids. They weren't there.

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:55.000
No, Animal Crossing was there, and I haven't even seen them, but I'm sure they're in this one.

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000
Animal Crossing and Zelda were the big DLC packs.

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:00.000
I thought that they were in there.

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:02.000
Nope, they're new.

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:04.000
Oh, who gives a shit?

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:14.000
Well, I'm not that big on the characters, but again, it's more about the fact that now I'll have it portable, and the battle mode stuff will be neat, so I'm very excited about it.

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:20.000
So, there we go. Let's see, going to chat over at live.fognetwork.com.

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000
BbBlackWolf says, I give a shit. LOL.

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:30.000
Let's see, ActDeft also says, I'm one of those that give a shit. So, low-key, some folks give a shit.

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:35.000
And you know who else gives a shit? People that buy fucking Apple products year after year after release.

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:40.000
It's fine, if you want to buy the same product over and over again, then more power to you. I'm just not going to do it.

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:44.000
That's why everybody gets to have an opinion, I suppose.

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:46.000
Even if they're wrong.

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:58.000
Alright. Well, here's the thing, low-key, interesting sales news about this, but it is coming from Nintendo, so I suppose you could take a skeptic's angle to this.

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:11.000
However, in an interview that was in the New York Times with NOA President Reggie Fils-Aime, he mentioned that the Switch in America and Canada has outsold the Wii in a two-day period.

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:19.000
This means the Switch has surpassed 600,000 in sales if you break the numbers down in that same region.

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:29.000
So that could mean that if you consider worldwide, because Japan sold another 313,000, they probably sold a million at least in that first week, which certainly is outpacing Wii U.

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:36.000
Now, I'm going to say it before you can, because I totally understand the skeptic's angle to this.

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:40.000
It's much easier to sell them when you made enough to put them on the fucking shelves.

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:52.000
Exactly. Because they would have sold a ton more. I guarantee if they had an infinite amount of product available, they would have sold more of the Wii than they would have the Switch.

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:57.000
J.D., when you were at that Best Buy, were there people that got turned away who couldn't buy a Switch because they ran out?

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:09.000
I didn't stay long enough to find out. My Best Buy had two lines, so the people who were in the no pre-order line, they let some of them in, and then some of the pre-order people, and just alternated.

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.000
So I left it at 1230, and I was fine.

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:14.000
Gotcha. I figured there might be some people who left it there.

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:21.000
And how nice of them to be able to see them, Nintendo, being the ones that actually control that shit as far as how much product is available.

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:25.000
How nice to say that, oh, look at the Switch is doing so much better than the Wii.

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:31.000
Okay, I get that, but that skepticism aside, at least there is a positive I see with this.

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:36.000
Is that the Wii U didn't have a supply problem.

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:38.000
Oh no, it did have a fucking supply problem.

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:44.000
I was able to find one that morning that it launched without waiting in line, I just casually went into Target and picked one up.

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:52.000
I mean, I think after maybe that initial period, then yeah, there was a supply problem, but you didn't see it fly off the fucking shelf like the Wii did.

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.000
Oh yeah, no one's gonna argue that the Wii U was a strong platform at all.

01:07:56.000 --> 01:08:06.000
But then I would say that is good news for Nintendo, because they have to do better than they did with Wii U, and it looks like the Switch is doing better than Wii U.

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:09.000
Well, just saying.

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.000
I mean, that's such a low bar to explain.

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:16.000
Well yes, it was a low bar, but Nintendo had to overcome it.

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:18.000
Good job.

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:20.000
How does it compare with the original Wii, though?

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:24.000
Because I know the original Wii was selling really well, because of Wii Sports and all that.

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:30.000
It did, but not until it was already out for a year, because nobody could fucking buy one when it was first out.

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:38.000
Yeah, and they're not gonna fucking play that angle. They're not gonna say, well, our fucking distribution line was fucked up like crazy, and now it's just less fucked up.

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:45.000
Okay, I'm gonna really try to think back. Dark Soccer, think back with me. You gotta go back in your brain ten years. You ready?

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:52.000
Remember when y'all went to that Target, and Xtifer was there, and you were there, and Maggie and Chris went too, right?

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.000
It was just, actually it was me and Kristen.

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:57.000
I thought Xtifer was with you.

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.000
I thought Xtifer was with you, or did he go to a different store?

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:01.000
He went to a different store, I think.

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:03.000
Okay.

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:05.000
Because we went to the Target in Citrus Heights.

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:07.000
Maybe he went somewhere else. All right, but all that stuff aside.

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:09.000
We bribed our way in line.

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:15.000
How many Wiis were sold? Like 14 or something, right?

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:19.000
Something like that? No, there were more, because everyone who was in line got one.

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:21.000
But it wasn't that...

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:23.000
It was like 20.

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:27.000
JD, were there more than 20 people in the pre-order line to get a Switch?

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:32.000
I was like 20th in line, and I got there at 6pm. There were definitely lots more people than that in line.

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:37.000
So the point is, they had 20 Wiis on day one, and way more Switches on day one.

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:44.000
Yeah, they were giving out tickets, and they were continuing on around the corner of the building where I was, so they definitely had more stock.

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:49.000
Now granted, I am comparing Target in Sacramento to Best Buy in the heart of the Bay Area.

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:52.000
However, I would wage your money. This is still a safe comparison.

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.000
I mean, it's only one of two Best Buys in the city, so...

01:09:56.000 --> 01:10:00.000
Yeah, so there's just plenty more availability of the Switch.

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:10.000
Okay, then perfect. And I hope that they do have that availability going forward, because they're not going to have any excuses then if it still doesn't outperform the Wii.

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:13.000
Then they're going to have no excuses.

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:18.000
Holiday is going to be fascinating. Holiday is going to be very, very fascinating for the Switch.

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:28.000
Because it will be fascinating to see if the Switch still has that same momentum, like that must-have system going into Holiday, and what Nintendo's going to do to it to really kick it in the ass.

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:33.000
It's going to be more than a Mario game, and I think this is what they're saving the Netflix angle for.

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:42.000
I'm telling you, this is what Switch is going to do. It's going to have Netflix, but you're going to be able to watch Netflix on the TV, and then thanks to downloading Netflix, you can pick up...

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:50.000
It's not a differentiator. It really doesn't matter. It doesn't matter at all that it doesn't have Netflix or has Netflix, because it's not a differentiator.

01:10:51.000 --> 01:11:00.000
Alright, anyway. Moving on, the Switch is selling, but how well it's selling, I suppose, is open to how you want to read into that.

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:06.000
We'll hopefully see some harder numbers in about a month's time, especially when Nintendo's financial year ends.

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:15.000
Meanwhile, though, we're going to go on to a different topic. I know Nintendo's really been dominating the conversation the past few weeks. It is a new system after all, but other gaming news going on as well, right, DarkSakura?

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:17.000
Kind of weird. Weird news.

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:19.000
How so?

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:29.000
Well, basically, two unlikely game developers are getting in bed and making sweet, sweet music game love.

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:31.000
Oh my god, yes.

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:33.000
Except not in the way that you think it is.

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:41.000
So it's Hasbro and Harmonix. And they are putting together a music card game.

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:52.000
So, and I had to bring this one up because, you know, we started off as a music game show and we, you know, had our long line with harmonix through the life of the show.

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:54.000
Of course.

01:11:55.000 --> 01:12:06.000
Doing a card game called DropMix. It was basically you play different cards that have the bass, the beat loops or vocals of a song on a DropMix board.

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:15.000
And when the card is played, the corresponding piece of music goes on with a phone, be it iOS or Android, that's connected to the board.

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:20.000
So as multiple cards are placed, the app starts merging them into a track.

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:33.000
And basically it's using the NFC to be read by the board. And it's got actually a pretty decent list of songs. I mean, just different.

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:37.000
It's got like Earth, Wind and Fire, September. It has the final countdown.

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:42.000
I wonder who's going to build a sequence. It's just nothing but that.

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.000
We've got Run DMC, It's Tricky.

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:46.000
Oh wow.

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:51.000
Some friends for Nan Afrijack, Bruno Mars, Young MC. So Busta Move is in there.

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:53.000
That'll be fun.

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:57.000
Weezer's King of the World, A Tribe Called Quest Scenario, some Skrillex, whatever.

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.000
Can you mix, can you mix the songs together?

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:03.000
It's got churches in it.

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:05.000
Interesting.

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:06.000
That makes me happy.

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:07.000
Can you, can you mix the songs together?

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.000
It doesn't say anything about it, but it's going to go for a hundred.

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:11.000
Uh huh.

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:20.000
It's available in September and it will have a 16 and no, it has an additional 16. And okay, let me start over.

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:30.000
It comes with 60 cards in the game board. It comes with an additional 16 and five card packs will be released for 15 and $5 respectively.

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:34.000
And new cards coming out through 2017.

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:41.000
I love that we've still got DLC in a harmonics music game, even though, you know, the card games have done this for years.

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.000
So it's funny to me. This is their version of DLC.

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:48.000
Yeah, it's more like BC, Buyable Content.

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.000
Well as long as you're only buying the songs you want, it's not so bad.

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:53.000
Unless they're mixed up.

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:57.000
Well with card games, this is the fucking norm. Like take any card game, this is the norm.

01:13:58.000 --> 01:13:59.000
Who in this room played Magic?

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:01.000
Cards Against Humanity. Hello?

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:03.000
No, no, Magic's even worse than that.

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:07.000
But anyway, who in this room still plays Magic?

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:09.000
Rageinator, raise your hand.

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:11.000
It got way too expensive.

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:13.000
I'm sorry?

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:15.000
I played the Pokemon trading card game a little.

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.000
Keep in mind, I've sold two full collections of Magic cards.

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:24.000
I was going to say, I sold my Magic the Gathering trading card deck my junior year of high school. That's how long that fucking game's been around.

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:26.000
I played all the way through my first round of college.

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:28.000
But it's a fun game. No disrespect.

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:38.000
But I wanted to say about this, I love the concept of how they're utilizing smartphones as a game controller.

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:46.000
Very similar, like Jackbox Party Pack kind of rethought that whole thing to how to do a party game with a bunch of cell phone controllers.

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:48.000
It's kind of like Harmonix has done that in a different way though.

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:55.000
They're using it now with an analog game, I suppose, or a more traditional board game, the smartphone controllers,

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.000
as opposed to a video game like what we saw at Jackbox.

01:14:58.000 --> 01:14:59.000
It's the marriage of genre right there.

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:05.000
I just had a thought. What is Jackbox going to do with the Joy-Cons on the Switch? Because that would be amazing.

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:12.000
I don't know, but if I remember right, the whole trilogy, the Jackbox trilogy, I think shows up on that.

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:16.000
Indie games coming for Switch, so they're doing something.

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:25.000
Yeah, I don't know. We'll have to email our friends over there and see if they want to come on to talk about the Switch version when it releases.

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:32.000
And why we're going to buy their game again, just like I buy fucking Shovel Knight and Mass Effect 3 and all this other stuff.

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:38.000
Kaijuto in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says, we have the living card game now, Rob.

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:43.000
The trading card game is getting phased out, so not every card game has that now.

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:46.000
I thought deck building games were all the rage right now.

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:48.000
Ascension and Dominion.

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.000
Ascension, Dominion, and I played one that was all DC comic.

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:56.000
Oh yeah, there's the DC deck building game, which is the actual name of it. There's also a Marvel one called Legendary.

01:15:57.000 --> 01:16:02.000
What's the one where it's like a PvE type of card game, where you're fighting a boss sentries of the...

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:04.000
Sentinels of the Multiverse?

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:09.000
Sentinels of the Multiverse, that's it. I thought deck building was the huge thing right now in card gaming.

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.000
Yeah. I mean, it is one of the...

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:16.000
It's fun! I love the concept of a PvE card game as opposed to a PvP card game.

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:23.000
I mean, the concept is like you're playing a comic book thing out and you choose your character based on which deck you pick out.

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:25.000
Yeah.

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:27.000
I mean, it's very comics-flavored. It's a lot of fun.

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:31.000
Alright, let's move on. Boy, our first part of the show is going along tonight, but that's okay.

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:37.000
It always seems like the slower news weeks, which, yes, I know PAX happened this weekend. We're on the wrong coast.

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:42.000
It seems like it was kind of a slower news week this week because everybody's too busy playing fucking Zelda, which I understand.

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:47.000
But it's the slow news weeks. They always have longer shows. Go figure. Loki.

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:51.000
So, Share Factory is getting quite the update on PlayStation 4.

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:56.000
So, the biggest part about it is you can actually import your own clips now.

01:16:57.000 --> 01:17:02.000
Or external clips, I should say, using like a USB flash drive so you can put your own photos, your own video clips.

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:11.000
Along with that, they've also added over 30 textures that you can use to personalize text in the game.

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:23.000
They also have a new infomercial theme. There's a new photo mode collage thing, new stickers, and then, of course, updates to the overall UI.

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:30.000
I might have read this wrong, but didn't I hear that you can put GIFs in now? Like, you can load GIFs into your videos?

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:40.000
Maybe. Because if so, like, it's over. Like, I'm going to go to town with GIFs because my favorite thing is on Twitter and Share Factory.

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:47.000
Which, you know, when that first came out, I was playing around a lot with Share Factory. I think I still have something up on my YouTube channel.

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:52.000
Like, I compiled all these Final Fantasy XIV things into something in Share Factory.

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:58.000
You know, it's a pretty powerful little tool that I think is really underutilized. Probably because it takes a little time to learn.

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:05.000
But I'd be very curious how these new features kind of might make it better. And now the fact that you can kind of mix in your own stuff, too, would be really cool.

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:10.000
I have to say, one advantage of Slack over IRC is that you can do GIFs so much easier.

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:16.000
That is true. That is true. William Ritterface in chat says, can you import your own snipper clips, though?

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:25.000
Well, if you can import your own video, yes, you could. You would capture the footage of snipper clips on your PC or whatever, holding a phone up to the screen if you have to.

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:33.000
And then you could import that into your PlayStation video. So maybe I want to make a video in Share Factory that's nothing but my favorite Forza Horizon clips.

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:37.000
That's funny. Alright, anyway.

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:46.000
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, corn.

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:53.000
Moving on. Nintendo making money this week, but no, not from the Switch. Something else.

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:59.000
And honestly, even though they're making money in theory, they probably won't see any of this money for a good long time.

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:10.000
Here's the deal. It's $12.76 million Canadian dollars. Sorry, it's Canadian dollars because a Canadian federal court ruled in the favor of Nintendo America.

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:24.000
This was Nintendo America taking GoCyber Shopping Limited and the owner, Jeremy King, to court this week because this company was distributing circumvention devices, flash carts, mod chips, game copiers, all the things that Loki loves.

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:30.000
Sky 3DS, Gateway 3DS, and all those similar devices the court ruled is illegal.

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:37.000
And so he was found, I guess, guilty of being a distributor of all these game copy devices and so on.

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:44.000
And so I guess at one point he used to kind of boast about what he did, or at least that's what I'm reading about in these stories.

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:51.000
I don't have an example of that though. But now he's going to have to apologize on his website for the damage that he caused Nintendo.

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:59.000
Nintendo in a statement saying, Nintendo continues to be a leader in bringing innovative gaming platforms and software to our fans and millions of gamers across the globe.

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:06.000
Blah, blah, blah, track record, blah, blah, blah. We will vigorously enforce our intellectual property rights against those that attempt to steal or misuse them.

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:08.000
Yeah, like making YouTube videos of them.

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:17.000
Yeah, but no $12.6 million judgment in a YouTube case. Although I'm not going to argue Nintendo and some of their YouTube rules are pretty shitty.

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:27.000
But there's a big difference between Zelda music in a YouTube video and flash carts, game copiers, mod chips with the intent to copy software.

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:32.000
Not to Nintendo. That's the problem. There's no difference to that.

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:37.000
So do you think they're going to take me to court because I did a video on Legend of Zelda 8-bit on YouTube?

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:39.000
They'll monetize it.

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:48.000
I'm sure, I think they already did. No, I demonetized the video because I'm like, if I can't make money, neither can you. Ha ha ha ha ha. That's what I did.

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:52.000
But if you were making money, they would, they still may put ads on it.

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:58.000
Please. I'm not going to make, I'm not going to make money on YouTube. Let's be real. Let's start there.

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:06.000
Stopian Chat over at live.vognetwork.com says, that is so Canadian. His sentence is to apologize.

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:12.000
Come on. Anyway, let's see.

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:19.000
Dark Tetsuya Chat says, reminds me of when they nailed the guy behind the 76,001 Nintendo 64 Famiclone system.

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:22.000
There was a huge magazine ad about it when he got in trouble.

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:29.000
And aren't, people are reselling those mini NES classics with a bunch of games loaded into them, right?

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:31.000
So they're just asking for too much.

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:33.000
Who's selling them because I haven't found any in the stores.

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:37.000
Speaking of supply issues and fuckery in Nintendo.

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:40.000
Can't even get that system out.

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:43.000
Alright, anyhow, moving on. Just a few more stories before we get to the classic game of the week.

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:45.000
But first, our Sakura.

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:47.000
Mass Effect. Of course.

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:49.000
Ermagerd, it's almost here.

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:51.000
I know, right?

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:53.000
Have you watched any of the stuff that's come out of PAX?

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:55.000
Tried not to.

01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:57.000
Are you trying to keep yourself spoiler free?

01:21:58.000 --> 01:21:59.000
Yeah, except for the important things like character customization.

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:01.000
Yeah.

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:03.000
Because that's all I care about.

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:05.000
Of course.

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:07.000
And hey, can you fuck that? There's that too.

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:16.000
One of the things that got let out under Twitter is that you can pick which of the twins that you start with.

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:19.000
But then you can change your mind while doing customization.

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:24.000
So in effect, that means you can customize each of the rider twins.

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:28.000
And looks like a bunch of customization will go in.

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:37.000
So there also will be a lot more in the way of decision making that's going to affect the outcome in that.

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:44.000
But they said that the Mass Effect Andromeda character selection and character creation will be a lot like Fallout 4's.

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:49.000
Where you have them switch back and forth while they, you know, you can customize each character.

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:56.000
And then once you are in that position, then you can no longer customize it.

01:22:56.000 --> 01:23:00.000
Although I know the community, there's going to be mod tools out before too long.

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:03.000
So that's cool stuff.

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:10.000
Yeah, I like the fact that the whole like the parent or the dad I guess kind of looks like how you customize the twins.

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:12.000
It's kind of interesting.

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:15.000
Well, they kind of did the same thing in Dragon Age 2, remember?

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:23.000
Where whichever of the siblings that you had, their appearance was based on what you chose for your hawk.

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:30.000
So to probably a much lesser extent since I doubt that it was as sophisticated as what Andromeda.

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:32.000
Frostbite is going to help.

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:41.000
But it'll be fun. And given what I've played in Frostbite games already, having played Dragon Age Inquisition, I'm looking forward to the level of customization.

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:51.000
I mean if someone can make What's His Face from the Wild Thornberries in Dragon Age or Nicolas Cage in Dragon Age because he's in everything ever.

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:55.000
They can do that for Mass Effect.

01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:59.000
I'm very excited from what I'm hearing on Mass Effect multiplayer.

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:03.000
It sounds like it's going to be faster paced than Mass Effect 3, which is already pretty fast paced.

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:08.000
But that they're not really changing the core. It sounds like it's still going to be very similar. The core elements the same.

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:15.000
But the nice thing is you're not going to be required to play it at all. They're not doing that galactic readiness thing they did in Mass Effect 3 or any of that.

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:22.000
So you won't be required to play it to get the good ending. I think it's something about you can send out strike teams to do things.

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:29.000
And either you just send them out and they do it, or you are a part of that strike team in the multiplayer.

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:31.000
Like that's how it works.

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:33.000
In Inquisition?

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:35.000
Oh yeah, it was like the same thing in Inquisition, yeah.

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:40.000
Yeah, you'd have your table missions and then it would unlock certain parts of the map for you.

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:45.000
And as you walked through Skyhold, you did run into the multiplayer characters.

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:47.000
Yeah, I bet it's a similar thing.

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:50.000
You couldn't talk to them, but they were hanging out there. Except Isabella, dammit.

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:53.000
I was tickled when they put Isabella in multiplayer.

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:59.000
So maybe, I don't know, maybe magically Blasto will show up.

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:00.000
Blasto will show up.

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:06.000
What are the characters that we know and love or will love in the new Mass Effect game will show up.

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:11.000
But not a lot of plot spoilers leaking out still, which good. That's the stuff we don't want to be spoiled on.

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:13.000
That's the stuff that Dark Soccer doesn't want to hear about.

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:18.000
But people are going to start playing it, what, Thursday, right? Is when EA Access or whatever that thing is.

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:23.000
Origin is going to get that 10 hour preview or whatever of Mass Effect.

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:27.000
So look out because spoilers are incoming on Thursday.

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:30.000
That's why I'm getting the heck out of town this weekend.

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:34.000
Alright, moving on. Loki.

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:43.000
Alright, so Bethesda has kind of talked about what the actual free to play model for Quake Champions is going to be.

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:51.000
So basically you start off with the Ranger and that's kind of your free character in the game.

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:59.000
If you feel like you want to try a different character, you can buy access to each of the characters for some sort of price.

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:07.000
And then, yeah, so you get one free but you have to buy the rest.

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:16.000
You get only one free. Did you say it's rotating or you just get to pick one and that's the one you get?

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:25.000
Yeah, well you get one. So here's the other thing though. You can also, if you don't want to pay for the actual players like the other characters,

01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:30.000
you can also earn that money with in-game currency called favor.

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:36.000
And that will also unlock the characters for a set period of time.

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:42.000
So you can also buy backpacks and brooms and whatever.

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:48.000
So basically it just sounds like a free to play model for a game. Not that surprising.

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:54.000
I'll still check it out. I like Quake games and so if it's free to play, why not? Just check it out at least.

01:26:55.000 --> 01:27:01.000
And the other thing, they showed off a little bit of one of the new champions that they have.

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:14.000
So they have Nyx who, let's see, I guess she's pretty agile and she has an ability called Ghost Walk that allows her to move between dimensions.

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:18.000
So while she does that, she's invisible and immune to damage.

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:21.000
So she's Sombra.

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:23.000
Yeah.

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:26.000
Since I think we all know what game may have inspired Quake Champions.

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:29.000
You don't say. The Game of Money? Is that what it is?

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:31.000
Yes.

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:37.000
Alright. Well also, a game that's no stranger to making money, Parappa the Rappa. That's right.

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:42.000
Parappa the Rappa. Remember they're re-releasing it again, but it's the remastered version for the...

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:46.000
How can you remaster that? I mean it's pretty basic looking as it is.

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:48.000
Yeah, but they were very pixely.

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:53.000
Well, and it's widescreen supported now. Remember the original was PlayStation 1 so it was a 3-4 ratio.

01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:55.000
That's kind of a stretch.

01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:59.000
Yes, that's what they're doing. They're stretching the image out to fill an HDTV.

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:08.000
So, Parappa the Rappa, you guys already forgot. They released Stage 1 during the PlayStation experience, I think it was, a couple months ago.

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:10.000
So I think folks forgot this is coming.

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:12.000
Yeah, they did. Surprise!

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:20.000
Well, it's been dated and dollared. It's going to come out March 8th for us in North America, which means it's out, I guess.

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:23.000
Did Parappa the Rappa remaster come out and I've missed it?

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:26.000
I think so. March 8th, I guess, I totally missed.

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:31.000
Oh, wow. I've been too busy with the fucking Switch to notice that this came out.

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:36.000
This might not have been the best time to release Parappa the Rappa stealthily on the PlayStation 4.

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:39.000
But it is $20 is what it's going to cost you there.

01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:44.000
So, April 4th in Europe for $11.99, local currency.

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:49.000
And in Japan, April 20th, you get that on $420 for 1,800 yen.

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:52.000
So, there it is. ActDeftInChat says, you gotta believe that it's already released.

01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:59.000
Yeah, I haven't really checked on what released on the PlayStation 4 store this week because I've been distracted with Zelda.

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:01.000
They should have released it the week before the Switch came out.

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:10.000
Yeah, or something. Also, one reason why Japan has to wait a little longer for it, there's actually going to be a physical release of this in Japan.

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:15.000
So, you can actually get a Japanese copy of the game with the box art, which looks really cute.

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:21.000
You can check that out. That will come out with the game on April 20th.

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:29.000
Also, don't forget, LocoRoco remastered and Patapon remastered are also scheduled for the PlayStation 4 at some point this year after this.

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:31.000
So, exciting stuff.

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:34.000
Alright, well, we're going to take a trip down memory lane.

01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:42.000
And every week, DarkSakura steps into the gaming vault and finds a game that she thinks ought to be remastered.

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:46.000
But once in a while in 2017, she brings out the whole damn system.

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:48.000
Yep.

01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:51.000
DarkSakura, what is the classic console of the month of March?

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:54.000
Of March. The WonderSwan.

01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:59.000
And I think that at least two people in this room own some kind of WonderSwan.

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:04.000
I do. A very generous listener of the show. I don't know if he listens anymore, but actually, um, Ram-

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:06.000
He's got a WonderSwan crystal, right?

01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:11.000
Yeah, Ram like a gaming company thing that resold this stuff and got me one, so that was really nice.

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:16.000
I have a WonderSwan color. I actually have the Final Fantasy I and II WonderSwan color.

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:23.000
So, but let's go back into the original WonderSwan, which actually, your ex-roommate had a WonderSwan color.

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:25.000
No, a regular WonderSwan.

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:29.000
And that's where I played Beatmania on WonderSwan, which is now background music for us.

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:34.000
It was the best home version of Beatmania as well. All the music was perfect.

01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:39.000
So anyway, the WonderSwan was a handheld game console that was released by Bandai.

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:45.000
It was actually developed by Gunpei Yokoi's company, Koto Laboratory, with Bandai.

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:51.000
So, um, it came out in 1999 amongst the fifth generation of consoles.

01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:57.000
And then there were two later versions, as I just mentioned, the WonderSwan color and the Swan crystal.

01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:06.000
All of them being supported until 2003, so there were no releases of this outside of Japan.

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:18.000
It was a 16-bit system, but it actually had a really, really long battery life in comparison to the Game Boy Color at the time and the Neo Geo Pocket Color.

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:20.000
Those were its contemporaries.

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:22.000
And it had a lower price point.

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:26.000
Honestly enough, I think the games looked a bajillion times better on it, too.

01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:34.000
It had different upgrades to it, you know, like I said, that add color and it had great audio.

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:36.000
I mean, just listen to this for a second.

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:39.000
Yes, I will. This is a sample from Beatmania.

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:49.000
Here we go.

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:54.000
Remember that thing?

01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:56.000
Yeah, the cat song.

01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:58.000
But doesn't that sound perfect?

01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:00.000
Yes, it sounds purrrfect.

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:03.000
But this is on a handheld.

01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:08.000
Keep in mind, the Game Boy Color one at the time was shit. Sorry, it was shit.

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:12.000
Comparing the Beatmania GB to this is like night and day.

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:28.000
Yeah, so the awesome thing about the WonderSwan is that you can play it horizontally or vertically, which the Klonoa game, which I've got for WonderSwan, it uses both orientations for some of the levels.

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:30.000
So it's really cool.

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:37.000
It had a lot of good third party support, mostly from Square, Namco, and Taito.

01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:49.000
They sold something like, for all of its iterations, something like 3.5 million units in Japan and had 8% of the Japanese handheld market at the time before the Game Boy Advance came out.

01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:52.000
Ooh, this is the other video of some of that third party stuff, huh?

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:54.000
Yeah.

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:03.000
Maybe not the most riveting music of the game.

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:06.000
Let's see how far we're going to...

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:08.000
Let's try to see if we can go here.

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:10.000
I gotta wait for it to load now.

01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:13.000
Little crystals coming together.

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:15.000
There we go.

01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:17.000
Exactly.

01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:19.000
There we go. That's the song I know.

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:22.000
This is what I bought my WonderSwan color for.

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:24.000
I played the crap out of this.

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:36.000
So anyway, in the past, Bandai had done a bunch of handheld games.

01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:43.000
They did a lot of licensing, like they had Tetsu on Adam, which we got as Astro Boy.

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:46.000
They did LCD games in the 70s.

01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:51.000
They did the Intellivision in Japan.

01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:53.000
They worked a lot for the Famicom.

01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:57.000
And then they had, of course, the Tamagotchi and Digimon.

01:33:58.000 --> 01:33:59.000
So we knew that that was a thing.

01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:05.000
So they basically went in a bit further and kind of did this on their own without other support.

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:12.000
We also knew that Yokoi created the Game Boy for Nintendo.

01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:21.000
But after the Virtual Boy kind of went kaput, he created Kodoo Laboratories so that they could work with Bandai to make the WonderSwan to compete with the Game Boy.

01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:26.000
So basically, he kind of parented two systems here, right?

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:31.000
So moving onward, they picked the name WonderSwan because of its aesthetics.

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:34.000
It had a 30 hour battery life.

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:38.000
I don't think it really was that close to it, but it did okay.

01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:40.000
It came with all kinds of colors. Nine colors.

01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:43.000
Some of them discontinued later on.

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:48.000
And I mean, as you can hear, the music was amazing.

01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:54.000
So I would say it was more on par with the Game Gear and Lynx as far as its capabilities.

01:34:55.000 --> 01:35:03.000
And then later on, the WonderSwan Color came out that had the full color screen and had backward compatibility with the WonderSwan games.

01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:10.000
And it came in different colors and had the special edition for Final Fantasy 1 and 2, which is the one that I have.

01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:13.000
I forgot to take a picture or I would show everybody.

01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:27.000
And then the Swan Crystal came out in 2002 and it was actually 7800 yen, which was about 1000 yen less than the Game Boy Advance.

01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:30.000
And it looked better and it sounded better.

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:38.000
It had a much better screen on it, but Nintendo already had a little bit more of the name recognition and it was only released in Japan.

01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:44.000
So it didn't have the international support, you know, that Nintendo of course had with a lot of this.

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:51.000
They also were powered, get this, by a single AA battery. All of them.

01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:53.000
As crazy.

01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:59.000
Yes. The Swan series were all from the single AA battery.

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:11.000
The WonderSwan Color, just double checking, it actually had 512 kilobits of RAM, which for the handheld at its time, was pretty amazing.

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:17.000
The WonderSwan Color would last about 20 hours with the battery.

01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:26.000
In this one, Crystal actually had a little bit less because it was also a more powerful system, but it lasted 15 hours.

01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:29.000
So really kind of negligible because who's going to sit and play it for 15 hours, right?

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:38.000
There were also other accessories. There's one called the Wonder Witch, which is a software development kit for amateur programmers.

01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:40.000
Which is what I call myself on the weekends.

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:45.000
Girl. But it also allowed people to develop games and see.

01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:51.000
There was an adapter for headphones, because it didn't have a headphone port.

01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:59.000
Kind of like what they did with the, which of the Game Boy models was it that had this, the SP.

01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:01.000
Like the adapter for that.

01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:09.000
It also had a remote controlled robot called the WonderBorg, that you could operate with your WonderSwan.

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:17.000
It can be connected to a pocket station to transfer save files, and it used a device called the WonderWave to do that.

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:27.000
So, and it also became one of the early internet capable handhelds that used a phone network.

01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:29.000
So really great stuff.

01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:31.000
She got on the internet too? Jesus.

01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:35.000
Right? I mean the thing was really ahead of its time.

01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:37.000
Sorry.

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:43.000
So other games that came out on it, of course, and I'm even just thinking of the ones that I have.

01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:46.000
They had a version of Go to Pay, of course.

01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:53.000
It had Final Fantasy, Final Fantasy II, Final Fantasy IV, Space Invaders, Densha de Go!

01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:57.000
We had Beat Mania. We had some Clone Ola games.

01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:01.000
I've got a Digimon game myself. I think I might have mentioned it.

01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:06.000
There was, um, hold on, I'm going to pull up the list of games here real quick.

01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:10.000
So, let's see.

01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:13.000
So we've also had Ark of the Lad on it.

01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:18.000
Um, and I'm looking at just the color games here. A ton of Digimon, a Dragon Ball game.

01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:26.000
We had Final Fantasy III was scheduled for it and cancelled, Front Mission came out, Golden Axe, Guilty Gear Petite, that's the other game I have.

01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:32.000
Um, uh, Hatsuraku Chocobo, which is Working Chocobo, another Square game.

01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:38.000
Um, Inuyasha games. We had a bunch of Gundam games.

01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:44.000
Um, Makai Toshi Saga, Mr. Driller, Namco Super Wars.

01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:47.000
Um, Romancing Saga, Rockman EXE.

01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:53.000
And I think that on the original one there was, um, Rockman and Bass, wasn't it?

01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:57.000
Came out. They were going to put Secret of Mana on it and that got cancelled.

01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:02.000
Uh, had Super Robot Tyson compact. Uh, had a Yamato game.

01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:08.000
Just all kinds of stuff. It was, it was pretty amazing. Great library.

01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:16.000
Um, there are, and by the way, there are emulators out there, like I, though I wouldn't say emulate it, but maybe the only way you can try some of these games.

01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:20.000
Yeah, maybe. Unless you want to pay like 800 bucks for one on eBay of somebody linked in our chat room.

01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:25.000
Yeah. Well, I've got mine and it'll play everything that I want it to, but, you know.

01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:27.000
So screw everybody else.

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:31.000
You know, the one thing though is that I kind of want a black and white one because of Beatmania.

01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:35.000
Because Beatmania had a little add-on that was the scratch wheel.

01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:41.000
And it doesn't fit very well on the, um, the color. Because the color's a little thicker.

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:43.000
Yeah, yeah.

01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:48.000
But, um, it was really fun playing Beatmania with that because you just have to figure out, you know, map where your buttons are and then there you go.

01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:56.000
So, um, I honestly think that if someone has a chance to get their hands on a WonderSwan, totally go for it.

01:39:57.000 --> 01:40:01.000
Even if it's just the first model WonderSwan, it's an amazing little handheld system.

01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:07.000
And, um, I even think to this day it's still pretty excellent competition.

01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:12.000
Yeah, especially just considering like how ahead of its time it was in some ways. It's just, you know, we just didn't get it here.

01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:18.000
It's like a lot of the systems that I've, you know, put on the list were, I'd honestly say, ahead of their time.

01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:23.000
You know, but the WonderSwan color is probably, um, among one of my favorites.

01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:28.000
Alright. There it is, your classic console of the month, the WonderSwan family.

01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:32.000
Oh, another point? When I bought my WonderSwan color, it was at Game Masters and Burlingame.

01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:33.000
Uh-huh.

01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:41.000
No, was it Game Masters? I forgot. You know the store. I also bought my copy of, um, uh, great.

01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:47.000
The name, the little stick figure with the music. Vib ribbon.

01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:49.000
Vib ribbon? Yeah.

01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:52.000
Yeah. I got my copy of Vib ribbon the same day and Kitty the Cool.

01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:54.000
Nice. Best day ever.

01:40:55.000 --> 01:41:00.000
Right? I came out of that game that day making out like a bandit and Dan picked up like a bunch of Saturn games.

01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:01.000
Cool.

01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:02.000
So, I just remember that was a good day.

01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:08.000
Alright. There it is, your classic console of the month. Dark Soccer will be back with a game next week.

01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:14.000
But in the meantime, we're going to take a quick break. There is more Orange Lounge Radio to come, including news on No Man's Sky.

01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:16.000
That's right. We're going to talk about that when we come back.

01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:20.000
And we're going to talk a little bit about the Final Fantasy VII remake and a little bit about Zelda Breath of the Wild as well.

01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:24.000

01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:50.000
We'll be getting to your call soon at Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.

01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:57.000
And then, of course, we always have our chat room as well over at live.voggenetwork.com where why are we talking about the N-Gage in chat right now?

01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:01.000
What is the N-Gage chat happening right now in chat?

01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:03.000
I had one.

01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:06.000
You had one? You did? I forgot about that.

01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:09.000
Yeah, remember I was like the only one who went over to the N-Gage booth at E3?

01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:11.000
Because they looked lonely.

01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:13.000
Yeah, they did look lonely. They didn't give you an N-Gage though, did they?

01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:16.000
No, Dan and I had N-Gages. Both of us did.

01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:18.000
Oh, I don't even remember that.

01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:22.000
We did a couple of other friends because, well, I think at the time Dan was working at Gamestop.

01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:24.000
Yeah.

01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:26.000
But something like that.

01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:28.000
Yeah, so probably, you know, got one as a preview or whatever.

01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:30.000
Yeah.

01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:32.000
To talk it up to potential sales.

01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:34.000
Yeah.

01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:40.000
Yeah. Oh, dear N-Gage. The good old taco phone. How I miss they. Anyway, we were enjoying some nice food there during the break. Some Stroopwafel, of course.

01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:42.000
You know, the must have here at OLR.

01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:47.000
And then, so you or Alan, somebody found those marshmallow Peep cookies.

01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:49.000
I saw them and I had to have them.

01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:53.000
But they're, okay, they're not, they don't taste like Peeps at all.

01:42:54.000 --> 01:43:01.000
Like I know DarkSakura, not a fan of the marshmallow stuff, but those cookies don't, like they taste like nothing to me. They literally, it tastes like nothing.

01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:03.000
It doesn't taste like soap, but it tastes like nothing to me.

01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:06.000
I mean, to me, I think they're better than Oreos, but worse than Peeps.

01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:11.000
I guess so. And then, there's Carrot Cake Hershey's Kisses.

01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:18.000
Which I saw at Rite Aid and it was one of those, like, I have to just buy this to see like if this is for real.

01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:21.000
And then DarkSakura was willing to try one of those, but you were like, it tastes like soap.

01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:27.000
Yeah. I just, anything that tastes that sweet that I would have normally liked before, it just tastes absolutely bizarre.

01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:29.000
I'm sorry.

01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:33.000
I don't know if it's the antibiotics or if it's my own fucked up nose or whatever.

01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:35.000
Or I just wanted to wash your mouth out with soap.

01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:39.000
I'm way beyond washing my mouth out with soap.

01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:43.000
I'd have to, like, deep throat an assembly line at Dove.

01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:47.000
Dove chocolates or Dove soap? Alright, anyway.

01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:49.000
We'll see.

01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:55.000
Alright, let's do some rapid fire news, some other quick news stories here that happened in the past week in games. Loki.

01:43:56.000 --> 01:44:00.000
The closed beta for Gran Turismo Sports is going to be starting actually in a few days. Looks like on March 17th.

01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:05.000
Select PlayStation Network users will get invited to participate in the beta.

01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:11.000
And when you do get invited, you get the selection of cars you can check out each day.

01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:19.000
And of course, you know, it has like the driver profile and stuff that tracks your sportsmanship and race performance.

01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:27.000
So cool. I wonder if they have the VR in there as well, because I know that's a feature of the game, but that'd be cool to try that out.

01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:29.000
Yeah. I'd be curious what that looks like.

01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:34.000
Now I completely forgot that they were doing a live action movie for this, but apparently they are.

01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:41.000
So Just Cause, they have their lead actor in the film, Jason Momoa.

01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:51.000
And you may remember Jason from such roles as Khal Drago in Game of Thrones, or he's also going to be Aquaman in the new Justice League movie.

01:44:52.000 --> 01:45:00.000
But apparently he is going to be playing Rico Rodriguez, which I don't know how they can do that in the movie, but it sounds awesome.

01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:03.000
So I'm down to check it out.

01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:10.000
Yeah. We'll see if they finally make a good video game movie, but let's just say my hopes aren't very high.

01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:16.000
You just can't really capture the nonsense that's in Just Cause with a movie, but I hope that they do.

01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:21.000
Well, some folks in chat are excited about that. Bonds006 says, nice. I will watch a Just Cause film.

01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:26.000
Brad from Pod Culture points out Ronan from Stargate Atlantis.

01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:34.000
But I know that Aquaman made a cameo in the Batman and Superman movie, right? Which I watched on the plane, and I was like, this is ridiculous.

01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:37.000
That was my whole feedback on Batman vs Superman.

01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:40.000
Aquaman and the Brave and the Bold, though, was fucking hilarious.

01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:42.000
That's pretty funny.

01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:46.000
The best thing about Batman vs Superman, no joke, was Wonder Woman. It was the whole reason to watch the damn movie.

01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:49.000
That's the only good thing I've heard anybody say about that movie.

01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:51.000
What's that?

01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:53.000
Actually, the new trailer looks pretty good.

01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:55.000
I'll check out the Wonder Woman movie.

01:45:56.000 --> 01:45:57.000
That will be the first DC movie I pay money for.

01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:07.000
I mean, the movie, to me, looks exactly like Captain America. It's like, this is fucking Captain America with Wonder Woman, which is fine. I mean, it looks cool. It just gets so many Captain America vibes from it.

01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:12.000
I wonder if they're going to have her weakness in it, where if she's bound by a man, she loses her powers.

01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:14.000
I hope they have her truth lasso.

01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:19.000
Well, you know how she was created, right? She was created by the polygraph inventor.

01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:28.000
And her lasso was supposed to be, but he was also really into BDSM, so that's why her weakness came in as being bound.

01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:33.000
It's also the reason there's a super dickery site, you know, all of these panels.

01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:35.000
Yeah. Ugh.

01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:43.000
Alright, well, we'll see. VidPower in chat says, the audience erupted when Wonder Woman came on screen in Buffy vs Superman.

01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:45.000
Buffy would win.

01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:54.000
Why did I read BvS as Buffy vs Superman? Just instantly my mind went to Buffy. Because everybody's been talking about Buffy because of the anniversary this week.

01:46:55.000 --> 01:46:57.000
Well, it's also because Buffy was abbreviated BTVS.

01:46:58.000 --> 01:47:00.000
Yeah, that's what it is. Thank you, JD.

01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:04.000
Is Superman going to be like a vampire in that?

01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:06.000
How's that going to work?

01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:10.000
We already know Buffy will beat Edward Cullen.

01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:17.000
Okay, thank you, Act F, just pointing out BvS Buffy Vampire Slayer. So that is a common acronym that's used there.

01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:23.000
So it's not crazy that I instantly went to Buffy vs Superman, which is the movie they really should have made, let's be real.

01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:30.000
Alright, anyway, let's talk about Bloodstained Ritual of the Night, a video game that could be better than Buffy.

01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:34.000
Nah, I don't know if anything will be better than Buffy, but Bloodstained will be pretty cool.

01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:42.000
It is confirmed, Bloodstained Ritual of the Night, it is coming to the Switch. Confirmed through a Nintendo of Europe advertisement.

01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:49.000
Bloodstained is now slated for the Switch. This game, of course, is already bumped back to 2018, so they have plenty of time to put it together.

01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:58.000
No clue if it will still release on Wii U. There has been no formal word on that yet, but I have a feeling Nintendo's probably going to pull the plug on Wii U before 2018.

01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:08.000
They're probably going to shut that thing down as fast as they can. Although, it's worth pointing out, we didn't bring it up earlier, but even though the Switch had all these releases this week,

01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:16.000
Nintendo Wii U did get a release this week on Virtual Console of all places, because I guess since there is still a Virtual Console on Wii U,

01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:25.000
Bomberman 64 was released on the Wii U this week, so if you are a Bomberman fan, I think Bomberman 64 is one of the ones that a lot of people remember.

01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:34.000
So, they may not pull the plug on Wii U that fast, but yeah, so it'll be interesting to see if Bloodstained still releases on Wii U, but I'm thinking probably not.

01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:41.000
You should probably plan on picking it up on the Switch, but at least that is confirmed that that will be coming there to no one's surprise whatsoever.

01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:51.000
Let's see, meanwhile, Wonder Boy the Dragon's Trap, another game that's slated for the Nintendo Switch, but this one will also be on the PlayStation 4 and the Xbox One,

01:48:51.000 --> 01:49:00.000
and then there will be a PC version later in the spring. This game is slated for April the 18th of 2017, that's when it's going to be hitting all those platforms.

01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:07.000
Remember, this is the one that lets you switch between the current graphics and the really cool hand-drawn graphics just by tapping a button, really.

01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:19.000
And what's also cool is that if you have old passwords, they work in the new game, so everything that you remember about Wonder Boy from the Sega Master System will come over to this game.

01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:24.000
So, Dark Soccer, do you still have Sega Master System codes for Wonder Boy written down somewhere?

01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:28.000
Probably somewhere. Well, and if not, there's the internet.

01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:36.000
There is this place called the internet, yes. So you can put in all the codes you want there on the remake, so that's pretty cool. Moving on, Dark Soccer.

01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:48.000
Well, for those who are excited about Mario Kart 8, it has a new unlockable character for beating the hardest difficulty, which is a gold palette swap for Mario.

01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:56.000
And no one curr. That's neat. Yeah. Period.

01:49:57.000 --> 01:50:03.000
And then, happiness, Wreck-It Ralph 2 is a year away! Yay! I love Wreck-It Ralph.

01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:11.000
But they basically, you're getting the voice cast back and everything is going to be awesome, and I see Qbert, so that makes me happy.

01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:16.000
And I see Eggman and Balrog, or Bison, so that makes me happy too.

01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:29.000
So, I wonder if we're going to see actual other video game stuff, as opposed to in the first movie it was mostly made up things, like Sugar Rush was a made up thing, and the whole Fix-It Felix and Wreck-It Ralph, that was all a made up thing.

01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:39.000
I remember, of course, the Street Fighter characters showed up, and there was cameos, but you didn't really get to see those other worlds, so I wonder if you'll get to see the other worlds this time.

01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:45.000
There's also Alan Tudyk's in it. He was King Candy before, but he's pretty versatile with voices, so I'm pretty excited.

01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:51.000
Maybe there'll be a flashback, or maybe there's Robo King or something. Maybe he's back.

01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:57.000
Or they get another, whatever he was supposed to be, Roadblasters. Or Turbo, whatever.

01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:01.000
Turbo, that's it. He probably comes back from the dead one way or another, I'm sure.

01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:04.000
Oh yes, because it wouldn't be without it.

01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:06.000
Of course not.

01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:08.000
Yeah, but that's it.

01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:13.000
Let's travel around the world and check out what is coming out in game stores this week, starting here in the US. Loki.

01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:18.000
So we've got Danganronpa 1-2 Reload on PlayStation 4.

01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:20.000
Pass. Just kidding.

01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:22.000
Bitch.

01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:25.000
You still need to sit and play it.

01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:28.000
Now if you may pass on that, this might be something you might be more interested in.

01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:32.000
Star Trek Bridge Crew on the Vive, Rift, and PlayStation VR.

01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:37.000
Well I don't have any of those VR things, but maybe I will borrow yours.

01:51:38.000 --> 01:51:43.000
I want to see the folks at the Starboard Power Coupling play this game together.

01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:57.000
I think it would be hilarious to get Dr. Ken Rip Roaring Drunk and Captain Matt and Lieutenant Eddie and get him high on life.

01:51:58.000 --> 01:52:03.000
And make him eat the whole bag of Peeps cookies and then play this game.

01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:06.000
I think they'd have a lot of fun with that.

01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:10.000
Anyway, hopefully that'll be a thing that happens.

01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:17.000
And then Styx Shards of Darkness on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:24.000
Excel World vs Sword Art Online Millennium Twilight on PlayStation 4 and the Vita.

01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:30.000
We have Kona on PC, Mac, and Linux, Xbox One, and PlayStation 4.

01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:34.000
And Nier Automata on PC.

01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:38.000
And last but not least, Senran Kagura Peach Beach Splash.

01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:43.000
For those of you who may not know, Senran Kagura is a big breasted ninja game.

01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:51.000
And this one of course goes the whole route of like, hey, we're just giving you some other excuses to have them in bikinis.

01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:55.000
So they're literally squirting water on each other.

01:52:56.000 --> 01:52:58.000
Yay!

01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:03.000
Dark Sakura! Let's do Let's Play.

01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:10.000
Yes, it's interesting. Just by the screenshots.

01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:14.000
Sorry, this game is also in my Japanese releases.

01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:20.000
And as I was going to put really quickly, just this quote from the page on Wikipedia for it.

01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:21.000
Yes.

01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:36.000
So it's literally a wet t-shirt contest as a game. That is literally what this is.

01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:41.000
So this game is also out in Japan this week. Senran Kagura Peach Beach Splash.

01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:47.000
And if you look at the cover, it's just ladies in white bikinis and super soakers.

01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:50.000
This is the best version of Splatoon yet.

01:53:55.000 --> 01:53:57.000
It would only be good if it had the same music.

01:53:58.000 --> 01:54:00.000
The whole little like da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.

01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:04.000
The little like ska music that like the little kids sing. It'll be hilarious.

01:54:05.000 --> 01:54:07.000
Alright, anyway. Check that out coming to a...

01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:11.000
I'm sorry, I have to look at some of these screenshots. It's one of those like I need to see it to believe.

01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:13.000
Yep, I believe it.

01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:16.000
This is so stupid.

01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:22.000
Anyway, you can get that in a regular version in Japan on the 16th.

01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:25.000
You can also get it in a new, new DX pack.

01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:27.000
Ooh, DX.

01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:31.000
Or a 5th anniversary DX pack. And if you say that real fast, it's Dix pack.

01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:35.000
So you can get a 5th anniversary Dix pack in Japan.

01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:46.000
You can also pick up a game this week in Japan on the 16th on the PlayStation 4 called Kono Yono Hatte de Koi wa Yutao Shuzhou Yuno in a regular and limited edition.

01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:49.000
It's called Rewrite out in Japan this week.

01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:55.000
And Excel World vs Sword Art Online Millennium Twilight, which I think Loki referenced here in the US.

01:54:56.000 --> 01:54:59.000
And then Disgaea 5 gets a price reduction this week as well in Japan.

01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:02.000
So pretty exciting time for you folks over there.

01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:06.000
On the Vita this week, that same Sword Art Online vs Excel World game is there as well.

01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:12.000
As well as that Kono Yono Hatte de Koi wa Yutao Shuzhou is out there as well.

01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:15.000
However, Peach Beach nowhere to be seen on the Vita.

01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:20.000
So I'm sorry you need the full 1080p experience on your PlayStation 4 for that one.

01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:26.000
On the Nintendo Switch this week, nothing in Japan. At least not retail.

01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:29.000
I don't know what their online service looks like. I don't get those dates.

01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:35.000
But I do have some dates for the 3DS, which include Monster Hunter XX is out on the 18th.

01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:41.000
That's a pretty big deal and you get all the accessories that come with it as well as the limited edition new 3DS XL.

01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:43.000
LL as they call it over there.

01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:48.000
And then another game that dares to compete against it just two days sooner, Future Card Buddy Fight Mezase.

01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:52.000
Buddy Champion is released in Japan this week.

01:55:53.000 --> 01:55:54.000
How about the UK?

01:55:55.000 --> 01:55:56.000
One thing.

01:55:57.000 --> 01:55:58.000
Yeah, too dark for PC.

01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:00.000
How dark?

01:56:01.000 --> 01:56:02.000
Two.

01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:04.000
Oh, the number two.

01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:06.000
So dark they made a movie about it.

01:56:07.000 --> 01:56:08.000
It was perfect.

01:56:08.000 --> 01:56:13.000
Alright, moving on. Let's get back into some news. No, we're going to do the mailbag first.

01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:15.000
I apologize. We got to get to our emailers.

01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:19.000
Participate at orangelaungeradio.com to send us emails every week.

01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:24.000
Dark Soccer is going to dive in the mailbag and find emails that are worthy of her attention.

01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:26.000
Sticky!

01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:31.000
Hello, OLR. First of all, a very belated congratulations to Rob and Alan for getting married.

01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:33.000
I hope you guys are enjoying married life.

01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:35.000
Smile!

01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:41.000
I wanted to comment on last week's episode about Mass Effect Andromeda getting a mature rating because of some full nudity in the game.

01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:43.000
Yay!

01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:45.000
An email about nudity.

01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:47.000
Naked.

01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:52.000
I was watching a trailer for the game and it hit me how violent it is shooting various alien races in the face.

01:56:53.000 --> 01:56:55.000
This does not seem to earn it a mature rating.

01:56:56.000 --> 01:56:57.000
Sorry.

01:56:58.000 --> 01:57:00.000
Loki's laughing in the kitchen for some reason at this whole thing.

01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:02.000
What?

01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:04.000
Shooting alien races in the face.

01:57:05.000 --> 01:57:07.000
This does not seem to earn an immature rating.

01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:09.000
Yet the sex does. How typical.

01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:11.000
I'm sure I'm preaching to the choir here.

01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:15.000
Well, I don't think, I mean, yes, you shoot things in the face.

01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:17.000
I don't think it's blood goes everywhere.

01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:19.000
I don't recall that in the older games.

01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:21.000
But it's still violence.

01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:25.000
It is. It is. But it's more like the Star Trek phasers never really cause blood to show up.

01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:27.000
It's kind of that whole violence.

01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:29.000
It should have cauterization burned.

01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:45.000
Yeah, you know, but that, I always kind of saw that as the violence in, but I mean, granted, you could set things on fire, you could ice them and then shatter the ice and stuff, but it just, it was like, but that would happen in Super Nintendo Mortal Kombat as well, which was sanitized for violence.

01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:51.000
So I think it's just that there's not blood everywhere kind of helps it in that regard.

01:57:52.000 --> 01:58:01.000
However, I do want to say that a well done lovemaking scene in a video game does add a lot as it can, as it can do in a movie.

01:58:02.000 --> 01:58:07.000
In The Witcher 3, for example, there's plenty of lovemaking to be done if you romance the right characters.

01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:10.000
I do think it adds something meaningful to the storytelling.

01:58:11.000 --> 01:58:14.000
It would be too bad if games were to shy away from this for fear of a mature rating.

01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:17.000
That's it. Love the show as always. Martin the Belgian.

01:58:17.000 --> 01:58:26.000
P.S. being a native Dutch speaker, I'd like to inform you of the correct pronunciation of, ah, I was right the second time, stropwafel.

01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:32.000
So it's stropwafel, like the ah versus the oh.

01:58:33.000 --> 01:58:44.000
I respect that we're probably saying it wrong. However, in this instance, I'm going to play my big stupid American card and be willfully ignorant because I'm sorry, strupwafel sounds cooler.

01:58:45.000 --> 01:58:46.000
And I like stropwafel.

01:58:47.000 --> 01:58:51.000
If you're going to look for strupwafel on the store shelf, you'll know exactly how to spell it.

01:58:52.000 --> 01:59:00.000
Pronounce the oh oh as you would pronounce the oh in hope, not the word hoop. Like it were stropwafel.

01:59:01.000 --> 01:59:02.000
Stropwafel.

01:59:03.000 --> 01:59:04.000
That actually sounds cooler. Strupwafel.

01:59:05.000 --> 01:59:06.000
I like strupwafel.

01:59:07.000 --> 01:59:10.000
The word strop means syrup in Dutch. So it literally is a pressed waffle with syrup in the middle.

01:59:11.000 --> 01:59:12.000
What's strop mean? Does it mean like...

01:59:13.000 --> 01:59:14.000
He just said it means...

01:59:15.000 --> 01:59:16.000
Penis or something?

01:59:17.000 --> 01:59:18.000
What's strup mean?

01:59:19.000 --> 01:59:20.000
Okay, Martin, tell us.

01:59:22.000 --> 01:59:24.000
Give us an answer, please.

01:59:25.000 --> 01:59:30.000
You know, actually, it's funny. A Dutch person corrected me on how to say my last name. My real one.

01:59:31.000 --> 01:59:32.000
Oh, really? Interesting.

01:59:33.000 --> 01:59:36.000
But I was like, but it's been Americanized.

01:59:37.000 --> 01:59:41.000
I know my actual last name is also Dutch, and I'm sure we're saying it wrong, too, but whatever.

01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:50.000
s2100matt points out in chat over at live.vognetwork.com that same reason why some New Yorkers pronounce Mario differently. They say Mario, right?

01:59:51.000 --> 02:00:00.000
And that's kind of, I don't, when I hear Mario, I go, oh, it's not it. But then, you know, everybody has a different accent and we have to respect that, you know.

02:00:01.000 --> 02:00:02.000
We don't have to respect stupid people, though.

02:00:03.000 --> 02:00:05.000
Hey, well, I just because somebody says Mario doesn't make him stupid.

02:00:06.000 --> 02:00:10.000
I didn't say it made him stupid. Just stupid people have stupid opinions sometimes and they're stupid.

02:00:11.000 --> 02:00:12.000
And wrong.

02:00:13.000 --> 02:00:17.000
Like me saying Stroopwafel. I'm going to be willfully stupid in this case. I don't care.

02:00:18.000 --> 02:00:19.000
You ignorant.

02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:21.000
That's right.

02:00:22.000 --> 02:00:23.000
Ignorant.

02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:27.000
I claim this name, or I claim Stroop, I claim it in the name of America. All your Stroopwafel are belong to us.

02:00:28.000 --> 02:00:32.000
I'm going to say Stroopwafel. Stroopwafel. That just sounds cooler.

02:00:33.000 --> 02:00:34.000
Ellen!

02:00:35.000 --> 02:00:36.000
Stroopwafel or Stroopwafel?

02:00:37.000 --> 02:00:38.000
Stroopwafel.

02:00:39.000 --> 02:00:40.000
Ellen agrees with me.

02:00:41.000 --> 02:00:42.000
Stroopwafel.

02:00:43.000 --> 02:00:44.000
Stroopwafel. Whatever.

02:00:45.000 --> 02:00:48.000
Hello, LR. Of course, I'm going to email you guys about Xbox Live Creators Program.

02:00:49.000 --> 02:00:50.000
Oh, I already know who this is. Hi, YYR.

02:00:51.000 --> 02:00:52.000
Well, who else sends us hello, LR?

02:00:53.000 --> 02:00:56.000
Thanks for covering it on last week's show. I figured I'd clarify a few things about it.

02:00:57.000 --> 02:01:00.000
First and foremost, yes, it is most definitely the new Xbox Live indie games.

02:01:01.000 --> 02:01:05.000
Similarly, there is very little barrier to entry and there will be little to no curation.

02:01:05.000 --> 02:01:09.000
Likewise, it will be separated from the main Xbox One store.

02:01:10.000 --> 02:01:17.000
Just as with Xbox Live indie game XBLIG. I'm going to call it XBLIG because it's fun.

02:01:18.000 --> 02:01:21.000
Games published on the service will not be allowed to have achievement.

02:01:22.000 --> 02:01:29.000
As far as peer review, nothing has been announced yet regarding this, but I have a hard time believing there will be no peer review or final approval of any kind.

02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:34.000
Otherwise, games can be released with crash bugs, inappropriate content, copyrighted material, etc.

02:01:35.000 --> 02:01:37.000
I have a feeling there will be something.

02:01:38.000 --> 02:01:40.000
XBLIG. It's just funny calling it XBLIG.

02:01:41.000 --> 02:01:43.000
Titles were allowed to have Xbox Live multiplayer features.

02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:47.000
Interestingly, titles published through this new program will not.

02:01:48.000 --> 02:01:52.000
Games featuring online multiplayer will have to be published via ID at Xbox instead.

02:01:53.000 --> 02:01:57.000
However, one Xbox Live feature we will now have access to is leaderboards.

02:01:58.000 --> 02:02:01.000
XBLIG previously did not allow these.

02:02:01.000 --> 02:02:06.000
Having a portfolio consist mostly of arcade style games makes this relevant to my interests.

02:02:07.000 --> 02:02:14.000
One major difference this time is that Microsoft is not giving a specific development software as they did with XNA last time.

02:02:15.000 --> 02:02:20.000
To create these games, we can use anything that can produce UWP or Universal Windows Platform apps.

02:02:21.000 --> 02:02:23.000
This includes frameworks like Unity and MonoGame.

02:02:24.000 --> 02:02:27.000
MonoGame, by the way, is an open source replacement for XNA.

02:02:28.000 --> 02:02:31.000
Porting XNA games to MonoGame generally takes a negligible amount of time.

02:02:32.000 --> 02:02:35.000
So XBLIG ports are definitely going to be a thing.

02:02:36.000 --> 02:02:39.000
I have already ported several of my own games to the MonoGame framework.

02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:42.000
There's no need to recreate them or reinvent the wheel.

02:02:43.000 --> 02:02:47.000
Speaking of those games, it is too early to make any announcements.

02:02:48.000 --> 02:02:52.000
I can't even get into the program yet, but I guarantee you we'll see bungee ferret tossing again.

02:02:53.000 --> 02:02:57.000
Maybe with added construction cranes and more ninjas. And more blood. A lot more blood.

02:02:58.000 --> 02:02:59.000
We have to use that extra blood.

02:03:00.000 --> 02:03:01.000
And nudity.

02:03:02.000 --> 02:03:03.000
They just need to be random boobs.

02:03:04.000 --> 02:03:06.000
Although, sadly, nudity would probably get him booted from the program.

02:03:07.000 --> 02:03:11.000
He can put as much fake pixel blood as he wants in there, but the minute somebody in the background is like,

02:03:12.000 --> 02:03:17.000
I love you ferret, and whips her tits out, it's going to get declined in the peer review.

02:03:18.000 --> 02:03:21.000
We just need to have a space where that can go.

02:03:21.000 --> 02:03:26.000
I understand that usually when you think of nudity, it's like adult games.

02:03:27.000 --> 02:03:31.000
But I want, like, why can't we just have a decent game that also has nudity?

02:03:32.000 --> 02:03:36.000
If nothing else, ladies in white bikinis, and men in white bikinis too, to be fair,

02:03:37.000 --> 02:03:39.000
because we're equal opportunity here, shooting each other with squirt guns in the background.

02:03:40.000 --> 02:03:42.000
Because at least you know that's okay.

02:03:45.000 --> 02:03:48.000
A lot more blood, and we have to use that extra power somehow, right?

02:03:49.000 --> 02:03:50.000
Please look forward to it.

02:03:51.000 --> 02:03:53.000
I'm probably still heading home from round one while you're reading this,

02:03:54.000 --> 02:03:56.000
but if you have more questions, I'll hear them out on the podcast.

02:03:57.000 --> 02:03:59.000
Have a great week, Erin Yyr.

02:04:00.000 --> 02:04:05.000
And moving on to the next email, if we're ready.

02:04:06.000 --> 02:04:08.000
Hey, OLR crew, AZHP here.

02:04:09.000 --> 02:04:13.000
On last week's show, you all mentioned that people should complain to the Better Business Bureau

02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:16.000
when Amazon did not fulfill their launch day delivery switch promises.

02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:20.000
While I'm all for consumer protection, the Better Business Bureau is not necessarily the best place to go

02:04:21.000 --> 02:04:23.000
when that protection is necessary.

02:04:24.000 --> 02:04:27.000
The reason for this is that the BBB is not actually any sort of governing entity,

02:04:28.000 --> 02:04:31.000
but is basically a more official sounding Yelp, long before Yelp was a thing.

02:04:32.000 --> 02:04:36.000
However, since the popular belief is that the BBB has some kind of authority,

02:04:37.000 --> 02:04:40.000
BBB used this as leverage to make companies pay them to increase their rating.

02:04:41.000 --> 02:04:45.000
It's extremely devious, and basically the business equivalent of the infamous

02:04:46.000 --> 02:04:49.000
engagement ring must be two months salary, marketing campaign,

02:04:50.000 --> 02:04:53.000
originated by DBears, which is so ingrained in the public consciousness

02:04:54.000 --> 02:04:57.000
that people believe it to be an infallible rule.

02:04:58.000 --> 02:05:06.000
I will also point out offhand, though, that having that review does reflect on the business,

02:05:07.000 --> 02:05:08.000
so I'll go ahead and keep going.

02:05:09.000 --> 02:05:11.000
Honestly, the best thing you can do in this case as a consumer

02:05:12.000 --> 02:05:14.000
is that if you were affected, complain to Amazon's customer service.

02:05:14.000 --> 02:05:16.000
You'll probably get a month extension on your Prime membership,

02:05:17.000 --> 02:05:20.000
and a 10% refund on your order. $30 is nothing to sneeze at.

02:05:21.000 --> 02:05:23.000
Meanwhile, I'm enjoying Zelda on my Wii U.

02:05:24.000 --> 02:05:30.000
Sure, it's only 720p, but the framerate is the same as the game is on Switch in console mode,

02:05:31.000 --> 02:05:34.000
although the portable mode apparently runs at a higher framerate.

02:05:35.000 --> 02:05:39.000
I can explain this in a future email if you're interested in the technical details.

02:05:39.000 --> 02:05:47.000
Sure, I can't play it on the Bart going to work or on my lunch break,

02:05:48.000 --> 02:05:53.000
but I didn't have to purchase or anxiously wait for another console to arrive in time for me to play it.

02:05:54.000 --> 02:05:55.000
You're truly AZHP.

02:05:56.000 --> 02:06:00.000
That's fascinating about the Better Business Bureau, and I honestly didn't know that,

02:06:01.000 --> 02:06:04.000
especially the whole fact that it's just basically an old-school type of Yelp service.

02:06:05.000 --> 02:06:08.000
I understand every time I read Yelp, I'm only going to see the bad stuff,

02:06:09.000 --> 02:06:13.000
and the good stuff is probably a question mark, because it's probably the friends and relatives that wrote that,

02:06:14.000 --> 02:06:16.000
and then people only go on that site to write reviews and they have problems,

02:06:17.000 --> 02:06:18.000
so I understand there's issues with Yelp.

02:06:19.000 --> 02:06:21.000
But the whole thing with Better Business Bureau, I thought there was a thing where you,

02:06:22.000 --> 02:06:23.000
and I'm actually seeing it in chat, too.

02:06:24.000 --> 02:06:27.000
SG100Matt says, the thing about BBB is that businesses have to respond to any claim against it.

02:06:28.000 --> 02:06:33.000
If they have no power when it comes to governing or whatever, how does a business have to respond to it?

02:06:33.000 --> 02:06:39.000
Or is that the whole, I guess, like, gotcha with the money thing that he's kind of referencing there?

02:06:40.000 --> 02:06:42.000
Well, it's like SEO, you know, if you don't respond to it, it's still your name of your business,

02:06:43.000 --> 02:06:45.000
and it shows up in a source that people think is reputable.

02:06:46.000 --> 02:06:49.000
Which is kind of the same strong army that Yelp does, which is kind of making them controversial in a way.

02:06:50.000 --> 02:06:55.000
Well, that's fascinating, but I just, here's the thing, so, okay, so you know something I didn't there about that,

02:06:56.000 --> 02:07:00.000
so thank you for sharing about that, but I just, I kind of disagree when it's the whole,

02:07:00.000 --> 02:07:06.000
well, then the only avenue is to go to Amazon customer service and accept the pitillants that they give you,

02:07:07.000 --> 02:07:10.000
you know, a month free of their own service type of thing.

02:07:11.000 --> 02:07:15.000
It's kind of one of those things where it's like, all I really wanted in this scenario,

02:07:16.000 --> 02:07:18.000
and honestly, I haven't checked in the past week to see if this has happened,

02:07:19.000 --> 02:07:21.000
so I'm going to just say that up front. I don't know if this happened.

02:07:22.000 --> 02:07:27.000
ActDeft, I know you got screwed by Amazon, so I'm curious if you got this.

02:07:27.000 --> 02:07:33.000
Did Amazon, like, accept responsibility and apologize in that?

02:07:34.000 --> 02:07:36.000
Did they accept responsibility and apologize?

02:07:37.000 --> 02:07:41.000
I don't mean some person in customer service that's paid to do that on every single call.

02:07:42.000 --> 02:07:47.000
Did the corporation accept responsibility and apologize and tell us how it's not going to happen again,

02:07:48.000 --> 02:07:50.000
and what they're going to do different next time?

02:07:51.000 --> 02:07:53.000
That's what I'm curious about. ActDeft in chat says not really, no.

02:07:53.000 --> 02:07:57.000
That's the only thing I really want in this scenario, I think,

02:07:58.000 --> 02:08:01.000
you know, is that Amazon needs to have their feet held to the fire a little bit

02:08:02.000 --> 02:08:05.000
before we consider purchasing another system through them in the future.

02:08:06.000 --> 02:08:09.000
I mean, disclosure, sorry, just disclosure, I had no issue with Amazon.

02:08:10.000 --> 02:08:13.000
I got my switch through them, and I had no issue, but I understand a lot of other people did,

02:08:14.000 --> 02:08:19.000
and so I think that's messed up for the people that also did the same thing I did. Sorry, Judy.

02:08:19.000 --> 02:08:23.000
I was just going to say, I think that given how huge a company Amazon is,

02:08:24.000 --> 02:08:26.000
they may not even care if it makes them look bad, you know?

02:08:27.000 --> 02:08:29.000
I don't expect them to put anything out about this.

02:08:30.000 --> 02:08:32.000
I kind of always thought that wasn't the case with Amazon, though,

02:08:33.000 --> 02:08:35.000
that they were very, like, customer service oriented,

02:08:36.000 --> 02:08:38.000
because don't they own that shoe site, Zappos or whatever?

02:08:39.000 --> 02:08:40.000
I think they bought them.

02:08:41.000 --> 02:08:43.000
Zappos is a huge thing as customer service.

02:08:44.000 --> 02:08:45.000
That's like a huge thing for Zappos.

02:08:46.000 --> 02:08:47.000
Right, but Amazon is like the everything store now.

02:08:47.000 --> 02:08:49.000
Like maybe 10 years ago they would have cared, but now, I mean,

02:08:50.000 --> 02:08:54.000
they just have so many different things that I don't think it's a big deal to them.

02:08:55.000 --> 02:08:57.000
But don't forget, everything we said at the top of the show,

02:08:58.000 --> 02:09:01.000
everything we said at the top of the show this week about Twitch and Amazon Company.

02:09:02.000 --> 02:09:03.000
Alright.

02:09:04.000 --> 02:09:06.000
Something to think about. Anyway, thank you very much for the email.

02:09:07.000 --> 02:09:10.000
And all the emails, that was it tonight, yes?

02:09:11.000 --> 02:09:15.000
Participate at orangelauntrader.com if you would like to email us in the future.

02:09:15.000 --> 02:09:17.000
In the meantime, we still have some news to catch up on

02:09:18.000 --> 02:09:21.000
before we get to your calls at Orange Lounge Radio. Loki.

02:09:22.000 --> 02:09:26.000
Alright. So, No Man's Sky's getting an update.

02:09:27.000 --> 02:09:29.000
And No Man Cares.

02:09:30.000 --> 02:09:33.000
I haven't played it even before the last update, so.

02:09:34.000 --> 02:09:37.000
Well, here's the thing. You know how PlayStation 4 got that boost mode this week?

02:09:38.000 --> 02:09:41.000
Okay, so it doesn't do anything for Overwatch, but I wasn't expecting it to,

02:09:42.000 --> 02:09:43.000
because I think Overwatch was after the pro was out anyway.

02:09:43.000 --> 02:09:45.000
But I heard that No Man's Sky...

02:09:46.000 --> 02:09:47.000
No Overwatch wasn't when the pro was out?

02:09:48.000 --> 02:09:51.000
Well, I thought it supported the pro, but only like 4K menus.

02:09:52.000 --> 02:09:54.000
It doesn't really enhance the game. Anyway, that stuff aside,

02:09:55.000 --> 02:09:58.000
I heard that No Man's Sky gets a boost out of this boost mode,

02:09:59.000 --> 02:10:02.000
so I do want to go back and check out that game now that boost mode is a thing.

02:10:03.000 --> 02:10:09.000
I haven't tried playing Final Fantasy XV, I'm feeling a little shafted on this pro thing.

02:10:10.000 --> 02:10:12.000
How about XIV? Oh, you don't play XIV on PS4 though?

02:10:13.000 --> 02:10:17.000
But I heard that XIV also got a boost from this, so I guess I need to go back and check out that one.

02:10:18.000 --> 02:10:19.000
So, anyway.

02:10:20.000 --> 02:10:25.000
Anyway, so the Pathfinder update was a new update that's coming out,

02:10:26.000 --> 02:10:30.000
and it's, I guess, some of the updates along with that.

02:10:31.000 --> 02:10:37.000
On the PC version, it's going to allow players to share bases online through the online Steam workshop,

02:10:37.000 --> 02:10:44.000
and also letting other people use and discover those bases and customize outposts.

02:10:45.000 --> 02:10:49.000
Also, there's an Exocraft vehicle that's coming.

02:10:50.000 --> 02:10:55.000
So, can you drive that?

02:10:56.000 --> 02:10:58.000
That's what it sounds like. It sounds like it's a little moon buggy type of thing,

02:10:59.000 --> 02:11:02.000
like the Mako in Mass Effect, but hopefully more drivable.

02:11:02.000 --> 02:11:09.000
That's pretty cool. And then they said also that there's going to be ground, I guess, with a ground transport,

02:11:10.000 --> 02:11:14.000
are going to be able to, that's one of the things that's coming with the ground transports,

02:11:15.000 --> 02:11:18.000
and then you can also mine the store resources with the bases.

02:11:19.000 --> 02:11:27.000
They're supposed to be adding a photo mode and improving the visuals for 4K on the PlayStation 4 Pro,

02:11:27.000 --> 02:11:38.000
and better rail solutions on the PlayStation 4 and PC, including a permadeath mode, multi-tool specializations, and ship classes.

02:11:39.000 --> 02:11:41.000
I'll tell you what, I'll play this game when they're done patching it.

02:11:42.000 --> 02:11:49.000
I mean, like, I think I'll just start over, because I don't remember what I was doing, and fuck if I care anyways.

02:11:50.000 --> 02:11:53.000
I'll start over when it's fun to play again.

02:11:53.000 --> 02:12:01.000
Like, it's not just this inventory management hell, which I think it's gotten better, but it'll be nice, there'll be a whole new game again.

02:12:02.000 --> 02:12:03.000
So you're saying, wake me up when the final version's out.

02:12:04.000 --> 02:12:08.000
Exactly. Wake me up when the game of the year, okay, when it's complete edition.

02:12:09.000 --> 02:12:13.000
Well, yeah, and to Hello Games' credit, they're not charging for any of this.

02:12:14.000 --> 02:12:15.000
Yeah, exactly.

02:12:16.000 --> 02:12:17.000
Because, oh my god, I can't even imagine.

02:12:18.000 --> 02:12:19.000
It was a $60 game, they better not be fucking charged for any of this.

02:12:19.000 --> 02:12:21.000
I can't even imagine the tweets they'd be getting if they were.

02:12:22.000 --> 02:12:24.000
That would be very upsetting.

02:12:25.000 --> 02:12:31.000
Alright, well good luck to them in putting that game together, and who knows, maybe they can turn it around like Diablo 3 got turned around.

02:12:32.000 --> 02:12:36.000
If they fix Diablo 3 in the original Final Fantasy XIV, anything's possible.

02:12:37.000 --> 02:12:44.000
Anyhow, Final Fantasy VII Remake, hopefully that's a good game when it comes out, but y'all better be ready for some changes.

02:12:44.000 --> 02:13:00.000
This probably isn't going to surprise anybody, but Tetsuya Nomura mentioned in an interview with Famitsu this week that showed off some new Final Fantasy VII Remake screenshots, there will not be the battle system that you're used to in the original. That's gone.

02:13:01.000 --> 02:13:03.000
Of course not, because they ripped the whole engine from XV.

02:13:03.000 --> 02:13:14.000
Yeah, they don't confirm that, and they don't really talk about what the system is that's replacing it, but I mean, you look at these screenshots, it's like this was built in XV's engine very, very clearly.

02:13:15.000 --> 02:13:29.000
It was, and even the stupid, remember in the whole shimmying along the little narrow wall areas and stuff like that, they have the same animation in the VII demo video thing that they add online.

02:13:29.000 --> 02:13:36.000
So it's obviously in the XV engine, that's why they're not there, it's like, fuck, we don't want to implement a new battle system, we'll just use the one we fucking have.

02:13:37.000 --> 02:13:46.000
What's worrying me about this is that it talks about how there's cover, and in an explanation, this is coming through a translation however, but in an explanation Nomura said,

02:13:46.000 --> 02:13:55.000
in the story, in situations where you're sneaking around, you won't just be able to march down the middle of the path. The original version had random encounters, and such parts were in the realm of imagination.

02:13:56.000 --> 02:14:05.000
But since this title is seamless, and you see the path that you're infiltrating, I decided it was necessary for the sake of realism. So you have stealth type of things instead of random encounters.

02:14:05.000 --> 02:14:16.000
That sounds fucking awful, especially considering how chapter 13 in Final Fantasy XV turned out, which, spoiler alert, heavily involved stealth. And it was awful.

02:14:17.000 --> 02:14:34.000
So, this concerns me big time. However, seeing as we only have a couple screenshots to go off of, and a translated quote, I'll give this a benefit of the doubt, I'm not going to come out and say, worst game ever, I'm over it, fuck it, you know, I'm not going to say any of that.

02:14:35.000 --> 02:14:47.000
Just, I have concerns that I hope will be alleviated when there is a demo for this game, or some type of something more playable, which I'm imagining will have to be this year's E3, we'll really start to see more about this.

02:14:48.000 --> 02:14:50.000
Well didn't they fix chapter 13, or are they going to fix chapter 13?

02:14:51.000 --> 02:14:53.000
I think it is dated around the Gladio DLC release.

02:14:54.000 --> 02:15:02.000
So maybe if they're fixing whatever the problem was, then they're going to fix it for this, or I don't know what exactly they're fixing, because I still haven't played past chapter 1.

02:15:02.000 --> 02:15:19.000
Let's hope. Let's hope. So, anyway, I do want to say that also it was pointed out that you could just run into enemies and fight them if you prefer, but Barret can use cover as well, there's a special element in Gunners, but they're not saying anything on it yet.

02:15:20.000 --> 02:15:29.000
There's also a screenshot out there of Cloud and Barret actually fighting the first boss in the game, which is, you know, you might remember from the original Final Fantasy VII, but it's totally different now, everything is different.

02:15:29.000 --> 02:15:43.000
So, are they still, are they actually going to release this game as Final Fantasy VII Remake? Is that the actual name they're going to put on the box and sell it as? That's a weird name to me. Why don't they just call it Final Fantasy VII, or Reimagined or something?

02:15:44.000 --> 02:15:54.000
Or Alterna VII. Or just 2017 edition, I don't know, it's weird to me. By the way, I'll just mention it here, because I thought I had it elsewhere on the show, but I don't see it.

02:15:54.000 --> 02:16:14.000
Final Fantasy XII, they've been talking about that at PAX a little bit, and there are some special editions going up on sale right now. The Super Hela Mega Special Edition actually comes with Judge Busts, little metal busts of some of the judges in the game, which you might remember are kind of the antagonists in the game.

02:16:14.000 --> 02:16:31.000
So, yeah. I mean, if you want to spend $200 on the Uber Special Limited Edition of Final Fantasy XII, you can get that, but I think I'll just take that regular one that's in a tin, thanks. But I'm super looking forward to Final Fantasy XII. Really looking forward to that. Anyhow, DarkSakura, what do you have for us?

02:16:32.000 --> 02:16:43.000
Well, there's some news about Breath of the Wild. The whole reason that Link isn't wearing his little pointy hat, anyone want to guess why? It didn't look good.

02:16:43.000 --> 02:17:05.000
It basically said, and this is the quote from Satoru Takazawa, as the graphic fidelity has increased, it becomes more difficult to make that hat look cool. As the game becomes more realistic, it's difficult to present it in a way that's appealing. So basically, it made him look like a big dork. Although there is a way to get it.

02:17:05.000 --> 02:17:10.000
I was going to say, I thought somebody had shared on Twitter, like they had an outfit where they had the pointy hat.

02:17:10.000 --> 02:17:16.000
You have to beat, well to get other parts of it, you have to beat all 120 shrines.

02:17:16.000 --> 02:17:18.000
That's a lot.

02:17:18.000 --> 02:17:21.000
We've maybe done like 50.

02:17:21.000 --> 02:17:23.000
I'm like, have I even found 12?

02:17:23.000 --> 02:17:26.000
Some of them are really close to each other too.

02:17:26.000 --> 02:17:31.000
Stop having stupid rewards for really hard challenges, is what I'm saying.

02:17:31.000 --> 02:17:33.000
They're not that hard.

02:17:33.000 --> 02:17:36.000
I feel like a costume throwback is not a stupid reward.

02:17:37.000 --> 02:17:43.000
It goes like, was it the metal skin, the gold Mario for being, it's like that's stupid.

02:17:43.000 --> 02:17:46.000
You know what would be a great reward is a weapon that doesn't break.

02:17:46.000 --> 02:17:48.000
That will happen.

02:17:48.000 --> 02:17:50.000
The master sword apparently.

02:17:50.000 --> 02:17:52.000
The master sword.

02:17:53.000 --> 02:17:57.000
The royal claymore and the royal bow, those have been really good.

02:17:57.000 --> 02:18:02.000
But we kind of skipped the Gerudo part. Not the Gerudo part, we've skipped the Goron part.

02:18:02.000 --> 02:18:07.000
Or as we've been calling them, the Morons, the Gorgonzola. We've come up with all kinds of names.

02:18:07.000 --> 02:18:12.000
We figured that the Gorons and the Zoras were once a race called the Gorgonzolas.

02:18:12.000 --> 02:18:14.000
So anyway.

02:18:14.000 --> 02:18:19.000
You know that this has the cartridges. I wonder if they can do like a Game Genie pro-action replay type thing with it.

02:18:19.000 --> 02:18:21.000
Doubt it.

02:18:21.000 --> 02:18:25.000
What I was saying is we're now where the bird people are.

02:18:25.000 --> 02:18:29.000
And it's actually interesting. We go into different parts and get things that help you with other parts.

02:18:29.000 --> 02:18:31.000
So just the interplay is pretty awesome.

02:18:31.000 --> 02:18:34.000
I'm where the water people are. That's what I'm doing right now.

02:18:34.000 --> 02:18:36.000
Yeah, that part was cool.

02:18:36.000 --> 02:18:38.000
You're at the heffalump.

02:18:38.000 --> 02:18:40.000
Yes.

02:18:40.000 --> 02:18:47.000
Also, I do see the screenshots floating around Twitter of where I guess if you were Link and you walk up to the edge of a bridge or whatever.

02:18:47.000 --> 02:18:52.000
Somebody walking on the bridge will actually tell you, don't do it. There's a lot to live for and all this stuff.

02:18:52.000 --> 02:18:56.000
There's so many little intricacies in the game.

02:18:56.000 --> 02:19:00.000
Was it the dog where if you run in circles next to a dog, the dog will chase its tail?

02:19:00.000 --> 02:19:02.000
Yeah, the dog will chase its tail.

02:19:02.000 --> 02:19:05.000
There's just little ridiculous things that are what make this game so great.

02:19:05.000 --> 02:19:12.000
Get this. Pick up a cuckoo. The chickens go out in front of an enemy.

02:19:12.000 --> 02:19:14.000
I saw this. I saw that GIF on Twitter.

02:19:14.000 --> 02:19:15.000
I haven't seen it.

02:19:15.000 --> 02:19:17.000
The chicken barrage comes back.

02:19:17.000 --> 02:19:23.000
But you get it to attack the enemy. You throw the chicken in front of the enemy when it attacks the enemy.

02:19:23.000 --> 02:19:25.000
You have to hold the chicken while it attacks you.

02:19:25.000 --> 02:19:29.000
And when it hits the chicken, all of its chicken buddies come out and beat the shit out of it.

02:19:29.000 --> 02:19:31.000
And it will kill a Hinox.

02:19:31.000 --> 02:19:32.000
Nice.

02:19:32.000 --> 02:19:33.000
That's pretty cool.

02:19:33.000 --> 02:19:35.000
I can see that they're in a Ganon fight.

02:19:35.000 --> 02:19:38.000
Can I use the chicken to beat Ganon? That would be awesome.

02:19:38.000 --> 02:19:39.000
That would be great.

02:19:39.000 --> 02:19:41.000
Excuse me, Calamity Ganon.

02:19:41.000 --> 02:19:46.000
Well, at this point though, I may have to excuse myself.

02:19:46.000 --> 02:19:47.000
Sure.

02:19:47.000 --> 02:19:51.000
Because I am still recovering, as you can hear in my voice.

02:19:51.000 --> 02:19:52.000
Yep.

02:19:52.000 --> 02:19:56.000
So I would like to bid our listeners a fond adieu for the evening.

02:19:56.000 --> 02:19:58.000
Farewell, DarkSakura. Thank you for being here.

02:19:58.000 --> 02:19:59.000
Thank you for having me.

02:19:59.000 --> 02:20:01.000
Do you have any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?

02:20:01.000 --> 02:20:02.000
Resist.

02:20:02.000 --> 02:20:05.000
Alright. Feel better, and we'll see you in seven days.

02:20:05.000 --> 02:20:06.000
Thank you.

02:20:06.000 --> 02:20:07.000
Awesome.

02:20:07.000 --> 02:20:11.000
Alright, well, while DarkSakura decides to head out for the evening to take care of herself,

02:20:11.000 --> 02:20:14.000
we're going to move on with just a couple more stories for you guys here. Loki.

02:20:14.000 --> 02:20:21.000
So, Pokemon Go has hinted to have, actually, the legendary Pokemon starting to appear later this year.

02:20:21.000 --> 02:20:24.000
Or at least it's been hinted at several times before.

02:20:24.000 --> 02:20:30.000
But now, with an interview with John Hank of Niantic,

02:20:30.000 --> 02:20:35.000
basically said, I can safely say we'll see more of it this year.

02:20:35.000 --> 02:20:38.000
Which could be, you know, more new Pokemon.

02:20:38.000 --> 02:20:44.000
Apparently it was out of a German article that was regarding the legendary Pokemon, but...

02:20:44.000 --> 02:20:48.000
Or it could just be a fucking cock tease so they don't have any fucking plans whatsoever for you.

02:20:48.000 --> 02:20:51.000
Well, see more announcements of it later this year, yes.

02:20:51.000 --> 02:20:53.000
I can see it now.

02:20:53.000 --> 02:20:56.000
Look, I do like Niantic a lot.

02:20:56.000 --> 02:20:58.000
I've lost a lot of fucking free time to Ingress.

02:20:58.000 --> 02:21:01.000
A lot of fucking free time to Ingress.

02:21:01.000 --> 02:21:03.000
And now Pokemon Go.

02:21:03.000 --> 02:21:05.000
I don't even play Ingress as much as I used to.

02:21:05.000 --> 02:21:07.000
Now Ingress is one of those things where it's like,

02:21:07.000 --> 02:21:10.000
Oh, there's a field over my house, I guess I should go fuck it up.

02:21:10.000 --> 02:21:12.000
You know, that's my Ingress playing now.

02:21:12.000 --> 02:21:15.000
Pokemon Go, I still kind of roll with that.

02:21:15.000 --> 02:21:19.000
And I still get pissed off at all these memes that are like,

02:21:19.000 --> 02:21:21.000
No one plays Pokemon Go or no one cares about Pokemon Go.

02:21:21.000 --> 02:21:24.000
Because I probably do more walking because of Pokemon Go.

02:21:24.000 --> 02:21:28.000
But I can say that and at the same time still go.

02:21:28.000 --> 02:21:32.000
It is really like kind of bullshit some of the things Niantic is doing with this whole like,

02:21:32.000 --> 02:21:34.000
you know, the legendary still aren't in the game.

02:21:34.000 --> 02:21:37.000
They don't seem to be doing any type of live events or any of this stuff.

02:21:37.000 --> 02:21:40.000
And I get they got to space things out to make things more exciting,

02:21:40.000 --> 02:21:43.000
but they have, oh, five more generations worth of Pokemon

02:21:43.000 --> 02:21:47.000
that they're still going to be like teasing over the next years and years and years to be working with.

02:21:47.000 --> 02:21:49.000
So, I don't know.

02:21:49.000 --> 02:21:51.000
SSG100Matt in chat says,

02:21:51.000 --> 02:21:53.000
Speaking of which, I need to cash out of gyms right now.

02:21:53.000 --> 02:21:57.000
Yeah, that's the thing that I would like Niantic to kind of work on is like make the gym interesting.

02:21:57.000 --> 02:22:01.000
Like it's the gym game is stupid right now. It's really stupid.

02:22:01.000 --> 02:22:02.000
All it is...

02:22:02.000 --> 02:22:03.000
It's like no point.

02:22:03.000 --> 02:22:05.000
It's Rhyhorn's, Vaporeon's, Blissey's.

02:22:05.000 --> 02:22:07.000
Uh, what else? What am I missing?

02:22:07.000 --> 02:22:08.000
Gyrodos.

02:22:08.000 --> 02:22:09.000
Snorlax.

02:22:09.000 --> 02:22:10.000
Snorlax.

02:22:10.000 --> 02:22:11.000
Then that's it.

02:22:11.000 --> 02:22:12.000
Lapras maybe?

02:22:12.000 --> 02:22:14.000
Maybe Lapras or one of, no, Lapras got nerfed.

02:22:14.000 --> 02:22:15.000
Dragonite's.

02:22:15.000 --> 02:22:16.000
Okay, Dragonite's. That's it.

02:22:16.000 --> 02:22:21.000
So, my point is out of the now 250 Pokemon in this game,

02:22:21.000 --> 02:22:26.000
it's the same fucking 10, and that's being generous because it's really more like 6,

02:22:26.000 --> 02:22:29.000
but it's the same fucking 10 that are always the ones that take gyms.

02:22:29.000 --> 02:22:31.000
Just wait until we get legendaries.

02:22:31.000 --> 02:22:32.000
Ugh.

02:22:32.000 --> 02:22:33.000
Ugh.

02:22:33.000 --> 02:22:34.000
Ugh.

02:22:34.000 --> 02:22:35.000
Ugh.

02:22:35.000 --> 02:22:37.000
Anyway, it's just, it's not interesting.

02:22:37.000 --> 02:22:38.000
That's the thing.

02:22:38.000 --> 02:22:41.000
So, that's why, but I'm not really super getting into the gym game,

02:22:41.000 --> 02:22:48.000
but it's like, well, I would like to have all that fucking gold so I can buy things like, you know, incubators would be great.

02:22:48.000 --> 02:22:49.000
Anyway.

02:22:49.000 --> 02:22:51.000
Teddy Ursa. I saw a Teddy Ursa on a gym.

02:22:51.000 --> 02:22:52.000
Teddy Ursa?

02:22:52.000 --> 02:22:53.000
Not a Teddy Ursa, the Ursa.

02:22:53.000 --> 02:22:54.000
Ursa Ring.

02:22:54.000 --> 02:22:55.000
Yeah.

02:22:55.000 --> 02:22:56.000
I saw one of those on a gym.

02:22:56.000 --> 02:22:57.000
But that was a new-

02:22:57.000 --> 02:22:58.000
For like a hot minute.

02:22:58.000 --> 02:23:00.000
Who didn't know what they were putting down, or they were putting it down to Prestige.

02:23:00.000 --> 02:23:01.000
It was pretty buff.

02:23:01.000 --> 02:23:02.000
Prestige the gym.

02:23:02.000 --> 02:23:04.000
Ursa Ring is up there in stats.

02:23:04.000 --> 02:23:06.000
It's not like the best, but it's not bad either.

02:23:06.000 --> 02:23:07.000
Yeah.

02:23:07.000 --> 02:23:08.000
You can buff them pretty well.

02:23:08.000 --> 02:23:09.000
Alright.

02:23:09.000 --> 02:23:11.000
That's my last tidbit before I go.

02:23:11.000 --> 02:23:14.000
Hey, by the way, since I'm reading, piggybacking off of something I see in chat,

02:23:14.000 --> 02:23:18.000
can we call you, like, can we change your name from Dark Sakura to Calamity Jamie?

02:23:19.000 --> 02:23:21.000
I like that name.

02:23:21.000 --> 02:23:23.000
That is pretty good.

02:23:23.000 --> 02:23:24.000
Calamity Jamie.

02:23:24.000 --> 02:23:25.000
That's my sub, Nick.

02:23:28.000 --> 02:23:29.000
That's the remix edition.

02:23:29.000 --> 02:23:30.000
Alright.

02:23:30.000 --> 02:23:32.000
Calamity Jamie's on her way out for the night.

02:23:32.000 --> 02:23:34.000
Have a good one. Feel better.

02:23:34.000 --> 02:23:37.000
I'm gonna do a bunch of not talking, except when I yell at Dan for going the wrong way.

02:23:37.000 --> 02:23:39.000
Well, try not to yell so loud.

02:23:39.000 --> 02:23:40.000
Bye.

02:23:40.000 --> 02:23:41.000
Alright. Bye-bye.

02:23:41.000 --> 02:23:44.000
And last but not least tonight, before we open up the Skype line at Orange Lounge Radio,

02:23:45.000 --> 02:23:49.000
I know a lot of you will be very excited to hear about a new Steven Universe game.

02:23:49.000 --> 02:23:50.000
That's right.

02:23:50.000 --> 02:23:53.000
Steven Universe Save the Light is going to be coming out this summer.

02:23:53.000 --> 02:23:56.000
It's a sequel to Attack the Light.

02:23:56.000 --> 02:23:58.000
This time it is Save the Light.

02:23:58.000 --> 02:24:02.000
This time, though, the game will be out on consoles, not phones.

02:24:02.000 --> 02:24:04.000
So Attack the Light was out on phones.

02:24:04.000 --> 02:24:05.000
It was a mobile RPG.

02:24:05.000 --> 02:24:08.000
This one is actually gonna be something that's available on consoles.

02:24:08.000 --> 02:24:11.000
There'll be an updated battle system, fully customizable character selection,

02:24:11.000 --> 02:24:14.000
more emphasis on exploration and puzzle solving in 3D environments,

02:24:14.000 --> 02:24:20.000
and an all-new story from Rebecca Sugar and this team behind Steven Universe.

02:24:20.000 --> 02:24:22.000
This game was shown at PAX East.

02:24:22.000 --> 02:24:26.000
They even did a whole little panel on Saturday at 10 a.m.

02:24:26.000 --> 02:24:27.000
However, I wasn't there.

02:24:27.000 --> 02:24:32.000
But maybe somebody here was and wants to give us a call and talk about PAX East.

02:24:32.000 --> 02:24:38.000
Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype, is the place to call if you'd like to give us a call and say hello.

02:24:38.000 --> 02:24:39.000
Let's get to the Skype line.

02:24:39.000 --> 02:24:40.000
We got a call coming in right now.

02:24:40.000 --> 02:24:42.000
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

02:24:42.000 --> 02:24:44.000
It's Raginator.

02:24:44.000 --> 02:24:46.000
Hey, Raginator, it's been a while. What's on your mind, buddy?

02:24:46.000 --> 02:24:48.000
No, hold on.

02:24:48.000 --> 02:24:53.000
Sorry, I wasn't able to listen live last week, but...

02:24:53.000 --> 02:24:58.000
Well, as long as you have a permission slip, we'll excuse you this once.

02:24:58.000 --> 02:24:59.000
Yeah.

02:24:59.000 --> 02:25:07.000
But anyway, the reason for my call, you know, I want to bring up two things real quick.

02:25:07.000 --> 02:25:17.000
First, although it's a little too late for both the live listeners and those that may be listening on the podcast,

02:25:17.000 --> 02:25:33.000
I just wanted to mention that GLG just recently had their spring sale, which ended at 7 p.m. Eastern, 4 p.m. Pacific.

02:25:33.000 --> 02:25:35.000
Well, damn it, I just did.

02:25:35.000 --> 02:25:47.000
Yeah, they had a lot of good stuff on sale, ranging from the Ultimate Games to Mirror's Edge,

02:25:47.000 --> 02:25:55.000
some old LucasArts point-and-click adventure games, you name it.

02:25:56.000 --> 02:26:04.000
Their entire library was on sale, but a good chunk of it was on sale nonetheless.

02:26:04.000 --> 02:26:12.000
Well, I'm not sure when their sale could be starting. Probably not for a while.

02:26:13.000 --> 02:26:23.000
But as a word of advice, just keep an eye on the site and try picking up some games.

02:26:24.000 --> 02:26:40.000
I would definitely recommend GLG over Steam, if only for the reason that for the games that are on both Steam and GOG,

02:26:40.000 --> 02:26:53.000
9 times out of 10, the GOG version will have the nice little added bonuses of having the soundtracks included or screensavers included.

02:27:10.000 --> 02:27:19.000
Because I bought Covert Action and some stuff on GOG, you actually got PDF manuals and stuff that's really cool.

02:27:40.000 --> 02:27:48.000
With Indiana Jones point-and-click adventure games, The Dig, and I forget what else.

02:27:48.000 --> 02:28:04.000
Moving on to the second part of my call. Since the talk on tonight's episode of OR has been mostly RPG heavy, I thought I would pose this question.

02:28:04.000 --> 02:28:21.000
What RPGs did you play over the years that really made you stop and think, huh, you know what?

02:28:21.000 --> 02:28:37.000
I never really paid attention to RPGs before, never really cared for them, but this particular game or games makes the genre look interesting. I think it may stick with this genre.

02:28:51.000 --> 02:29:02.000
Fuck, I even played Adventure on Atari 2600 and Sword Quest, which is interesting because I didn't transition from Dungeons and Dragons as a lot of people did.

02:29:02.000 --> 02:29:12.000
I did play a little bit of D&D in high school, a little bit but not a lot of it. It was one of those things that would happen on a weekend every other month, there would be a sleepover or something.

02:29:12.000 --> 02:29:33.000
I always enjoyed the RPGs. There was always a real story in them that you could get into. I think that became especially true with Final Fantasy 2, which obviously is 4 as we all know it as now, but it's going to be 2 for me on the Super Nintendo.

02:29:33.000 --> 02:29:46.000
That was really the first one where it was like, OMG, it's not just the game elements where you have that progression and you feel your character level up and you get stronger and all this stuff, but it's like, OMG, the story is so freaking good.

02:29:46.000 --> 02:29:56.000
I think that's when I was like, oh, I'm a fan of this type of series for life. And then Final Fantasy 2 just led into things like Secret of Mana, which was also an amazing game.

02:29:57.000 --> 02:30:06.000
Chrono Trigger, I know we get into fun banters on this show about Chrono Trigger vs. Super Metroid, but at the end of the day, Chrono Trigger is still an amazing game, and it is.

02:30:06.000 --> 02:30:19.000
And other RPGs that we get into PlayStation. For me, it goes all the way back. RPGs never really needed a chance. I kind of get where you're going with the question, where it's kind of like, what's the RPG that really sold you on it?

02:30:19.000 --> 02:30:30.000
But I didn't need to be sold too. Loki, JD, was it the same for you guys? Or maybe you still don't like RPGs. I don't know. Loki, what about you?

02:30:30.000 --> 02:30:32.000
I don't like RPGs.

02:30:32.000 --> 02:30:35.000
I know you played enough Final Fantasy 11, you gotta like RPGs.

02:30:35.000 --> 02:30:49.000
Yeah, I mean, I don't know. I just haven't played any really great ones. I mean, aside from Skyrim. I don't really pick up a whole lot of JRPGs or anything like that right now. It's more of just more open world games.

02:30:49.000 --> 02:30:54.000
Skyrim's kind of a weird intersect, because I like sandbox-y open world games, and I like RPGs.

02:30:54.000 --> 02:30:56.000
And she'll have a Grand Theft Auto.

02:30:56.000 --> 02:31:03.000
Right, and so it's just like, boom. It's just like, okay, I like that. And then Fallout 4 is kind of like, hey, it's Skyrim, but it's futuristic.

02:31:03.000 --> 02:31:07.000
You really need this new Zelda game. You really need the new Zelda game, Loki.

02:31:07.000 --> 02:31:10.000
I will. I'll get it this week, but I just was waiting to get paid.

02:31:10.000 --> 02:31:11.000
I know, I know.

02:31:11.000 --> 02:31:14.000
So once Wednesday hits, yeah, I'll pick it up.

02:31:14.000 --> 02:31:21.000
I'm just saying, knowing as much as you love open world stuff, this new Zelda thing, you're gonna eat it up.

02:31:21.000 --> 02:31:23.000
JD, what about you and RPGs?

02:31:23.000 --> 02:31:24.000
I mean, my first video games-

02:31:24.000 --> 02:31:26.000
Don't forget to get a little closer to the mic there.

02:31:26.000 --> 02:31:30.000
My first video games were Pokemon Red and Blue, so I got started with RPGs.

02:31:30.000 --> 02:31:35.000
But, you know, as I've gotten older, I don't have the attention span for it anymore.

02:31:35.000 --> 02:31:37.000
Like, all of the grinding and all of the, you know, whatever.

02:31:37.000 --> 02:31:41.000
I'm just like, they don't click the same way for me they used to.

02:31:41.000 --> 02:31:45.000
I see. That's fair. But that's Pokemon Red and Blue.

02:31:45.000 --> 02:31:50.000
God, especially for people of a certain age, you know, the age you're at, JD.

02:31:50.000 --> 02:31:53.000
That was like the first game for a lot of 20-somethings.

02:31:53.000 --> 02:31:55.000
Yeah, it wasn't at all.

02:31:55.000 --> 02:31:57.000
Yeah, so that's a darn good point there.

02:31:57.000 --> 02:32:01.000
What about you, RageNator, real quick? What was the first RPG for you?

02:32:01.000 --> 02:32:07.000
You know, the funny thing is, I had the original Final Fantasy and Dragon Warrior for NES.

02:32:07.000 --> 02:32:15.000
I think anyone that subscribed to Nintendo Power for a certain length of time got Dragon Warrior for free.

02:32:15.000 --> 02:32:20.000
But, even with that being said, I never really cared for RPGs back then.

02:32:20.000 --> 02:32:22.000
I thought they were a total snore.

02:32:22.000 --> 02:32:30.000
But, in effect, my father mainly bought Final Fantasy for himself more than anything.

02:32:30.000 --> 02:32:34.000
But, I didn't even play any RPGs on the Super Nintendo.

02:32:34.000 --> 02:32:43.000
But, once I got myself a PlayStation 1, early on, I got myself three RPGs.

02:32:43.000 --> 02:32:53.000
Wild Arms, trying to think of, it's made by Konami.

02:32:53.000 --> 02:32:54.000
Suikoden.

02:32:54.000 --> 02:33:00.000
No, not Suikoden. Something Heart, Valiant Heart, Vagrant Heart, something like that.

02:33:00.000 --> 02:33:01.000
Vagrant Story?

02:33:01.000 --> 02:33:07.000
No, I think Vagrant Story.

02:33:07.000 --> 02:33:09.000
Vandal Hearts, says Ronda.

02:33:09.000 --> 02:33:12.000
Square Enix. What I'm thinking of is by Konami.

02:33:12.000 --> 02:33:13.000
Vandal Hearts?

02:33:13.000 --> 02:33:14.000
Oh yeah, Vandal Hearts.

02:33:14.000 --> 02:33:15.000
There it is.

02:33:15.000 --> 02:33:18.000
And then, of course, obviously Final Fantasy VII.

02:33:18.000 --> 02:33:28.000
But, those three, kind of made me say, wow, I've been such an idiot.

02:33:28.000 --> 02:33:32.000
These games are actually fun.

02:33:32.000 --> 02:33:34.000
I should have been playing RPGs all along, you know?

02:33:34.000 --> 02:33:36.000
It's like me and Mass Effect.

02:33:36.000 --> 02:33:41.000
I didn't care for it the first time, then I went back years later and I was like, wow, I was a real idiot the first time.

02:33:41.000 --> 02:33:49.000
You know, Dark Tetsuya said something about Shadow Run, but that made me think of another, like, I would kind of consider this an RPG of a real different type on the NES.

02:33:49.000 --> 02:33:54.000
It made me think of Shadow Gate, which was another game that really made me love.

02:33:54.000 --> 02:33:58.000
It's a very different type of RPG. It's not like the whole RPG with hit points and everything.

02:33:58.000 --> 02:34:04.000
Some would more consider that a point-and-click game, but I think there's a certain RPG element to it that I really love.

02:34:04.000 --> 02:34:07.000
Anyway, Rage Nator, great question. I'm going to let you go, though, so we can get more calls.

02:34:07.000 --> 02:34:09.000
Sure, have a nice night.

02:34:09.000 --> 02:34:10.000
Take care, my friend.

02:34:10.000 --> 02:34:13.000
OrangeLoungeRadio, all one word on Skype if you want to give us a call.

02:34:13.000 --> 02:34:20.000
If you want to talk about RPGs or you want to talk about something else, you want to talk about the Nintendo Switch or maybe something else we have not addressed yet tonight, we can do that.

02:34:20.000 --> 02:34:25.000
Let me check in with Loki to see if there's any last-minute stories we want to talk about while we wait for a call at OrangeLoungeRadio on Skype.

02:34:25.000 --> 02:34:27.000
Sadly, no.

02:34:27.000 --> 02:34:28.000
No?

02:34:28.000 --> 02:34:29.000
No.

02:34:29.000 --> 02:34:30.000
Oh.

02:34:30.000 --> 02:34:32.000
I mean, it's a slow news week and there's no news tonight.

02:34:32.000 --> 02:34:38.000
Yeah, it was a little slower of a news week this week, so let's see, let me go to some chat comments here.

02:34:39.000 --> 02:34:42.000
DungeonBuster has a good point here about RPGs in 2017. DungeonBuster says,

02:34:42.000 --> 02:34:46.000
The first few months of 2017 have been nuts with RPGs.

02:34:46.000 --> 02:34:56.000
Tales of Berseria, Yakuza 0, Horizon Zero Dawn, Nier Automata, Torment, Tides Into Minera, and coming up are Andromeda and Persona 5.

02:34:56.000 --> 02:35:02.000
Yeah, isn't this weird where, like, I think a lot of people are forgetting, well, probably not a lot.

02:35:02.000 --> 02:35:06.000
I keep forgetting that Persona 5 is coming out sooner rather than later.

02:35:07.000 --> 02:35:09.000
Because, yeah, Persona 5 is like the first week of April, right?

02:35:09.000 --> 02:35:13.000
Was it supposed to be Valentine's Day weekend and then they, like, bumped it back a little further?

02:35:13.000 --> 02:35:14.000
I don't remember.

02:35:14.000 --> 02:35:18.000
I thought it was for some reason. Maybe I'm confusing it with something else.

02:35:18.000 --> 02:35:22.000
But, yeah, Persona 5 is going to be just a few weeks away.

02:35:22.000 --> 02:35:24.000
I think it's only, like, a week or two after Mass Effect Andromeda.

02:35:24.000 --> 02:35:28.000
So, they, okay, Act Def confirms, yes it was, so I'm not crazy.

02:35:28.000 --> 02:35:30.000
It was bumped back just a little bit there.

02:35:30.000 --> 02:35:35.000
But, you know, Persona is a huge, that is, like, the RPG series for a lot of people.

02:35:35.000 --> 02:35:40.000
So, you know, that's going to be a big, Mass Effect's a big series, Persona's a big series.

02:35:40.000 --> 02:35:43.000
Whew! Anyway, we got another call coming in. Let's get to it.

02:35:43.000 --> 02:35:45.000
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?

02:35:45.000 --> 02:35:47.000
Hey, hey, hey, it's Aranma.

02:35:47.000 --> 02:35:49.000
Hey, Aranma, how you doing?

02:35:49.000 --> 02:35:52.000
I'm pretty good besides my usual trip to IKEA.

02:35:52.000 --> 02:35:56.000
Slowly still getting past that whole flooding I mentioned before.

02:35:56.000 --> 02:36:01.000
I'm now putting in new and improved bookcases to organize all my hobbies.

02:36:02.000 --> 02:36:07.000
So, Rama, I know you called in with something else, but I have to derail for a minute because you're going to want to know about this.

02:36:07.000 --> 02:36:14.000
I got confirmation. I will be in your area the weekend of October 13th when you're not going to be there.

02:36:14.000 --> 02:36:16.000
God damn it!

02:36:16.000 --> 02:36:26.000
However, Alan and I are currently trying to plan, like, do we want to go, because the ceremony is on Friday the 13th, as I suspected.

02:36:26.000 --> 02:36:29.000
She's that type of gal who wanted her wedding on Friday the 13th.

02:36:29.000 --> 02:36:35.000
So, we may come in, like, Tuesday, because the wedding is actually in Connecticut.

02:36:35.000 --> 02:36:39.000
But Alan's never been to New York and has kind of wanted to see it.

02:36:39.000 --> 02:36:45.000
So, I'm kind of like, maybe we need to fly in a few days early so we can be the big stupid tourists that go see something on Broadway and go out.

02:36:45.000 --> 02:36:47.000
You know, it just depends how much time off work we can get.

02:36:47.000 --> 02:36:52.000
So, I don't know when you leave for your other engagement, but either we're going to come in a few days early or we're going to stay a few days extra.

02:36:52.000 --> 02:36:56.000
And I just have to figure out all those details, but it's still a few months away.

02:36:56.000 --> 02:37:01.000
So, guess what, Northeast, I'm going to be back in October.

02:37:01.000 --> 02:37:07.000
That's going to work, and it's kind of interesting you say that, because I was hanging out with one of my close friends last night.

02:37:07.000 --> 02:37:10.000
She was actually going to get married on Friday the 13th.

02:37:10.000 --> 02:37:18.000
It must be a trend. Maybe Alan and I will renew our vows while we're there. No, I would never try to upstage my friend.

02:37:18.000 --> 02:37:22.000
So, because I'd get beat up.

02:37:23.000 --> 02:37:26.000
Anyway, what did you want to call in to talk about before I derailed us?

02:37:26.000 --> 02:37:31.000
Alright, couple things. Number one, at the top of the show, you made a mention to the movie Big.

02:37:31.000 --> 02:37:32.000
Yes.

02:37:32.000 --> 02:37:36.000
I don't know if you know, but F.A.O. Schwartz is no longer there.

02:37:36.000 --> 02:37:40.000
That's right. It turned into Toys R Us for a bit, right? And now that's gone too, right?

02:37:40.000 --> 02:37:49.000
No, no, no. The location, F.A.O. Schwartz was like much further up. It was pretty much next door to the Apple Store, the 24-hour Apple Store.

02:37:49.000 --> 02:37:50.000
Oh.

02:37:50.000 --> 02:37:55.000
Yeah. Due to rent, that closed. The big Toys R Us due to rent, that closed.

02:37:55.000 --> 02:37:59.000
Oh, so they were not the same building. I got that wrong. Okay.

02:37:59.000 --> 02:38:05.000
And also, you mentioned earlier about snow conventions and PAX East.

02:38:05.000 --> 02:38:08.000
Brother, let me tell you a quick story.

02:38:08.000 --> 02:38:09.000
Can't wait.

02:38:09.000 --> 02:38:14.000
This is my first Catsacon. And I'm so hot hot hot to go, whatever.

02:38:14.000 --> 02:38:22.000
And, you know, we do our thing. Saturday night, halfway through masquerading all of that, it starts snowing.

02:38:22.000 --> 02:38:31.000
And I'm talking blizzard-conditioned snow. And there's signs around the convention telling people how much snow is expected and what to do.

02:38:31.000 --> 02:38:34.000
Some people say fuck it, pack they shit, and leave that night.

02:38:34.000 --> 02:38:40.000
They were the smart ones. The rest of us are like, you know, it's probably not going to be that bad.

02:38:40.000 --> 02:38:46.000
They'll be shoveled in the morning. We can leave sometime Sunday. Famous last words.

02:38:46.000 --> 02:38:57.000
Wake up that morning, we find out that Jersey has shut down, Virginia has shut down, and New York was getting close to being shut down as well.

02:38:57.000 --> 02:39:04.000
Oh, no. Oh, no. You were trapped in a five-star hotel with copious amounts of liquor and anime geeks.

02:39:04.000 --> 02:39:06.000
Give me a break. That was the best convention ever.

02:39:06.000 --> 02:39:10.000
Hold up. All that liquor was gone Saturday night. I'm talking about Sunday.

02:39:10.000 --> 02:39:18.000
All that liquor was gone on Saturday. Fair retort, sir. You win.

02:39:18.000 --> 02:39:26.000
First thing we do is grab our stuff and we go to the CVS, and lo and behold, you know it's an anime con because all the ramen is gone.

02:39:27.000 --> 02:39:33.000
So we're like, what the hell are we going to eat? We grab chips and cookies and soda and we're like, we will live off of that.

02:39:33.000 --> 02:39:38.000
One of the people in our party, yes, it was like a Final Fantasy party, the four of us.

02:39:38.000 --> 02:39:44.000
One suggested, well, why don't we go to McDonald's? We look across the street at McDonald's, even in the snow.

02:39:44.000 --> 02:39:48.000
There are people standing outside for food. I said, no, that's okay.

02:39:48.000 --> 02:39:54.000
Wow. So when did it end up happening? Did you end up having to stay longer or what happened?

02:39:54.000 --> 02:40:05.000
Yes. The hotel extended the rates. They let everyone stay Sunday for free because of what was going on, and then they extended the rate for Monday.

02:40:05.000 --> 02:40:10.000
So people were rebooking and rerooming to save a few dollars.

02:40:10.000 --> 02:40:22.000
And what was also great was the hotel said, if we were to raise $500, they would give us two of the big rooms downstairs and make it into one so we could extend the convention.

02:40:22.000 --> 02:40:28.000
So we kind of figured out where all the con goers were. We were knocking on their doors, sort of like Girl Scouts.

02:40:28.000 --> 02:40:38.000
In this case, we're anime scouts, whatever, cosplay scouts, telling people, you know, we're trying to raise money so we can extend the con by one day and get food.

02:40:38.000 --> 02:40:49.000
We end up raising about a grand and we end up getting like food platters from a supermarket up the way because it was enough snow plowed out, you know, we can get some stuff delivered.

02:40:49.000 --> 02:41:03.000
So from like 3pm until like 1, 2 o'clock in the morning, we're downstairs in the basement of the, I believe it's the Hyatt, Regent, Hyatt Plaza, Regency, whatever hotel, which was really awesome.

02:41:03.000 --> 02:41:14.000
We have one section that was DDR, one section was AMVs, one section was D&D buffer stores fighting this, this and that, and just platters of food. So we end up making the best of it.

02:41:14.000 --> 02:41:22.000
That's awesome. That's a great convention story, even though, you know, it sucks about the weather, just that whole community and you killed me with anime scouts.

02:41:22.000 --> 02:41:25.000
What's sad, though, is it's not the first time I've heard that story.

02:41:25.000 --> 02:41:34.000
When I went to Katsucon, you kept telling me about that epic year because I think it would only been like two or three years before the year I went.

02:41:34.000 --> 02:41:48.000
Yeah, and see, and what was happening was, now from that point on, whenever there is weather about snow when it comes to Katsucon, if it's before, which has happened, people will go down instead of Thursday, they'll go down Wednesday night to beat the storm.

02:41:48.000 --> 02:41:54.000
Or if they hear a talk of snow on Sunday, people will leave and be like, uh-uh, not happening.

02:41:55.000 --> 02:42:09.000
That's, that's so awesome. I love that story. That's great. So any conventions that should be on our radar coming up, Rama? You're the king of conventions here on the network with your buddies, of course, at Anime Jam Session.

02:42:10.000 --> 02:42:24.000
Zenkai Con, that's the big convention my whole squad, we are so hyped for. It's like the really awesome down-home convention. It's a mix of anime, video games, fantasy, sci-fi, it's a little bit of everything.

02:42:24.000 --> 02:42:38.000
One of the guests of honor is Steve Blum, as we all know, as from Cowboy Bebop. Why is his name, I'm missing his name right now, he voices on Cowboy Bebop, but we all know Steve Blum.

02:42:38.000 --> 02:42:40.000
That is awesome.

02:42:40.000 --> 02:42:49.000
Yeah, and he's also the main guy behind the whole voice actor strike. He's the one that kind of got it going, kind of spearheaded it.

02:42:49.000 --> 02:42:52.000
Is that still going with the video games?

02:42:52.000 --> 02:42:58.000
I have no idea. It probably is, but I haven't heard anything from my VA friends, so...

02:42:58.000 --> 02:43:13.000
Will you do me a favor? Will you poke some of your VA friends and see if that strike's still going? And if it is, I want to talk to some voice actors about it, because I think a lot of gamers, you know, we kind of forgot about it during the holiday and through this console hysteria, but if there's still no resolution, that's not good.

02:43:13.000 --> 02:43:17.000
I got you. I will do what I can. I got you on that, you know?

02:43:17.000 --> 02:43:23.000
I appreciate it. All right. Well, my friend, I'm gonna let you go, so we wrap up the show, but thanks for the call.

02:43:23.000 --> 02:43:27.000
Hey, you know, by the way, we say Mario, not Mario, it's Mario.

02:43:27.000 --> 02:43:29.000
Mario's fine.

02:43:29.000 --> 02:43:37.000
Yeah, I've never heard it pronounced any other way. It's like anime and anime and people look at you and they're like, who taught you that?

02:43:37.000 --> 02:43:44.000
I've heard Super Mario, but I didn't necessarily pin that as a New York thing, just a wrong thing.

02:43:44.000 --> 02:43:45.000
There you go.

02:43:45.000 --> 02:43:46.000
All right. Take care, my friend.

02:43:46.000 --> 02:43:48.000
You too. Stay awesome, dude.

02:43:48.000 --> 02:43:49.000
You too. Bye.

02:43:49.000 --> 02:43:50.000
Bye.

02:43:50.000 --> 02:43:55.000
All right. We're gonna close up Skype for now, but if you didn't get through and you want to, you can always tweet at us, at OLR.

02:43:55.000 --> 02:44:00.000
You can always email us, of course. Participate at Orangelaunchradio.com, but that is gonna do it for tonight's episode.

02:44:00.000 --> 02:44:05.000
We already said good night to Dark Sakura, but we'll say good night now to our guests, JD, as well as Loki.

02:44:05.000 --> 02:44:09.000
Let me first, of course, pimp a good, good cheer.

02:44:09.000 --> 02:44:12.000
If you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Launch Radio, please tell a friend or two about the show.

02:44:12.000 --> 02:44:18.000
Help us spread the word. A nice five-star review on iTunes goes an awful long way as well to help spread the word,

02:44:18.000 --> 02:44:22.000
because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but we can only spread those voices if they're here.

02:44:22.000 --> 02:44:24.000
So, yeah, help us spread the word.

02:44:24.000 --> 02:44:29.000
Five-star reviews on iTunes go a long, long, long way, or wherever it is that you heard about this podcast.

02:44:29.000 --> 02:44:32.000
JD, thanks so much for being here and sitting in the studio. Hope you had a good time tonight.

02:44:32.000 --> 02:44:33.000
Yeah, it's always fun.

02:44:33.000 --> 02:44:37.000
Enjoy playing more Switch. I hope to see you back here.

02:44:37.000 --> 02:44:39.000
You said you were debating coming up for Indie Arcade, huh?

02:44:39.000 --> 02:44:40.000
Yeah.

02:44:40.000 --> 02:44:44.000
That'd be cool. So, sadly, Mario Kart won't be out then yet, but we'll hopefully have some more Switch games to play.

02:44:44.000 --> 02:44:45.000
Right.

02:44:45.000 --> 02:44:47.000
Exactly. Any final thoughts for listeners tonight?

02:44:47.000 --> 02:44:49.000
Um, not really.

02:44:49.000 --> 02:44:53.000
Not really. All right. Just, you know, take care of each other, I guess. Don't be mean.

02:44:53.000 --> 02:44:59.000
All right. Thank you, JD. Loki, here we are at the end of our 679th episode.

02:44:59.000 --> 02:45:02.000
Good luck. I hope you're able to get Zelda this week. Hope Pay Day's good to you.

02:45:02.000 --> 02:45:03.000
Okay.

02:45:03.000 --> 02:45:05.000
All right. Any final thoughts for listeners tonight?

02:45:05.000 --> 02:45:12.000
No. It's funny. I'm working. I've been doing game programming all week. Sadly, it's probably not something you'll ever see.

02:45:12.000 --> 02:45:14.000
Well, no.

02:45:14.000 --> 02:45:16.000
It's not always the case, Loki?

02:45:16.000 --> 02:45:20.000
No, no, no. It's a work-related project, so that's why it's...

02:45:20.000 --> 02:45:23.000
All right. So, when you get paid to do it, then you actually do it.

02:45:23.000 --> 02:45:27.000
No, it's more for a presentation, but my presentation looks fucking awesome.

02:45:27.000 --> 02:45:31.000
All right. All right. That's going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

02:45:31.000 --> 02:45:36.000
Thank you guys so much for listening. My final thought tonight? Pizza. Mmm. Delicious.

02:45:36.000 --> 02:45:40.000
Have a good week, everybody. We'll see you back here in seven days to do it all over again.

02:45:40.000 --> 02:45:47.000
Thanks for your support. It means the world. In the meantime, enjoy your Switch or your PlayStation 4 or whatever it is you happen to be playing.

02:45:47.000 --> 02:45:49.000
Good night, everybody.
