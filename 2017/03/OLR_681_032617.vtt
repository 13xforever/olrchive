This week Good Ol' Games continues its improvements by providing universal cloud save support

00:18.120 --> 00:21.280
to every game they sell without the games needing updates to support it.

00:21.280 --> 00:24.560
This is just one bonus to delight gamers and we have much more to tell you about starting

00:24.560 --> 00:28.480
right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:28.480 --> 00:35.000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show

00:35.000 --> 00:36.680
where every gamer has a voice.

00:36.680 --> 00:43.560
It is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight with episode number 681 for this March 26th of

00:43.560 --> 00:45.080
2017.

00:45.080 --> 00:51.460
My name is Rob Roberts joining you every week here at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com

00:51.460 --> 00:55.420
Sunday nights at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf

00:55.420 --> 01:01.540
show and if you are listening live you can join us in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.

01:01.540 --> 01:04.620
Just a quick note for the live listeners, our website has been acting a little funky

01:04.620 --> 01:07.060
today because they've been doing some maintenance.

01:07.060 --> 01:10.700
So I've been trying to make the show live so y'all can check in because if you didn't

01:10.700 --> 01:14.300
know you can do that, you can actually check in over at vognetwork.com and you get points

01:14.300 --> 01:19.300
for listening to the show and same thing on the podcast if you're not able to be here

01:19.300 --> 01:22.660
live because you got something else going on Sunday nights, you can listen on the podcast

01:22.660 --> 01:25.980
feed, there will be a little interruption somewhere in the show and then Jason comes

01:25.980 --> 01:30.020
on and says to register participation use this pass phrase and he'll tell you what

01:30.020 --> 01:33.180
it is and you just go type it at the main page of vognetwork.com and you get the same

01:33.180 --> 01:37.220
check in all the live people get, same same, so don't say we don't love you podcasters

01:37.220 --> 01:42.260
but the website's acting funky, I can't turn it live although it just came up as

01:42.260 --> 01:45.400
I've been ranting here so maybe it was just one of those little hiccups while they've

01:45.400 --> 01:46.660
been doing maintenance.

01:46.660 --> 01:51.260
So while I mess with that, I should turn over here to my right and introduce Techmaster

01:51.260 --> 01:52.900
Loki joining me in the studio.

01:52.900 --> 01:53.900
Hello.

01:53.900 --> 01:54.900
Hi Loki, how are you?

01:54.900 --> 01:55.900
I have food in my mouth.

01:55.900 --> 01:56.900
Yeah, great, great.

01:56.900 --> 01:58.940
So we got all these radio problems going on, we got a busted website.

01:58.940 --> 01:59.940
That's alright.

01:59.940 --> 02:00.940
You're trying to talk with your mouth full.

02:00.940 --> 02:01.940
Well, how are you, Loki?

02:01.940 --> 02:02.940
I'm doing fine.

02:02.940 --> 02:04.340
So you were telling me about a trip to the movies?

02:04.340 --> 02:08.380
Yeah, I went and saw Lego Batman yesterday because I wanted to take my son to go see

02:08.380 --> 02:12.340
it because my wife doesn't want to go see it and he always likes to go in the movie

02:12.340 --> 02:13.340
for years.

02:13.340 --> 02:14.340
So we went and saw that yesterday.

02:15.020 --> 02:20.460
And it was fucking awesome because it's the Lego movies and the Lego movies are just fantastic.

02:20.460 --> 02:25.900
It was kind of cool about Lego Batman though, minor spoilers I guess.

02:25.900 --> 02:30.540
There's a lot of different villains from different movie series that come out in this

02:30.540 --> 02:35.080
because they go to the Phantom Zone and pull all these bad guys.

02:35.080 --> 02:41.100
So it feels a lot like Lego Dimensions the movie if they were going to do that.

02:41.180 --> 02:45.140
Mine is, of course, you know, Wild Cell and Gandalf and all that shit that are normally

02:45.140 --> 02:47.060
in the Lego Dimensions game.

02:47.060 --> 02:49.380
But they've got a lot of humor in it.

02:49.380 --> 02:53.400
It's just really funny, especially if you've watched all the other Batman movies because

02:53.400 --> 02:58.180
they make lots of references to stuff that happened in those and it was pretty awesome.

02:58.180 --> 03:00.980
That's funny that you went to the movies because you guys know, and I talk about this on the

03:00.980 --> 03:02.720
show, I never get to movies anymore, right?

03:02.720 --> 03:05.640
So I did get dragged to the movies this weekend.

03:05.640 --> 03:10.580
So my buddy, Shane, who comes on this show a lot and hosts another show here on the network,

03:10.580 --> 03:15.340
Power Ranger Pridecast, obviously he's very hyped about the Power Rangers movie.

03:15.340 --> 03:17.160
So he dragged me to go see that.

03:17.160 --> 03:20.560
In the fancy new theaters in Sacramento, and if you happen to be a local person, you know

03:20.560 --> 03:24.420
exactly which theaters I'm talking about, they tore down what we used to call the boobies

03:24.420 --> 03:27.420
because there were these big dome theaters that you could see from miles away and they

03:27.420 --> 03:28.420
were the boobies, right?

03:28.420 --> 03:35.340
So they tore down the boobies, they're gone, and then they put this large, very, it's just

03:35.340 --> 03:38.540
a very rectangular plane building now, it's not as exciting.

03:38.540 --> 03:43.760
But inside, it's super exciting because it has like the recliner seats that full recline,

03:43.760 --> 03:47.320
like I'm talking like Lazy Boys where you put your feet up and all this stuff, which

03:47.320 --> 03:49.360
I guess is the new trend in movies.

03:49.360 --> 03:54.260
You guys have this in your areas, where you can literally put your feet up and lean back

03:54.260 --> 03:57.260
and all this, or is this just like a local thing that's starting to spread?

03:57.260 --> 04:01.060
I imagine the Bay Area had to probably get it first.

04:01.060 --> 04:02.580
Usually they do.

04:02.580 --> 04:07.660
But yeah, so I went and saw Power Rangers in the fancy theater and I liked it.

04:07.660 --> 04:12.580
I know the critics are kind of saying it's kind of a mess, but I liked it well enough.

04:12.580 --> 04:18.740
It had issues, but I don't like super get into the show, obviously the same way Shane

04:18.740 --> 04:20.220
does, but I'm not a hater either.

04:20.220 --> 04:22.100
I'm just like, okay, cool, Power Rangers.

04:22.100 --> 04:26.700
I actually think the best way Shane ever kind of like, not that anyone should have to justify

04:26.700 --> 04:30.600
their fandom, but you know, Power Rangers sometimes get seen as more of a kid's show

04:30.600 --> 04:33.580
because it's like what, the Saturday morning show or something, right?

04:33.580 --> 04:37.180
But I think the best way he ever justified it in that way and kind of made me go, oh,

04:37.620 --> 04:41.500
was when he said, well, people get super into Marvel movies and Marvel heroes.

04:41.500 --> 04:44.220
So if these are the heroes you're into, what's the difference?

04:44.220 --> 04:46.140
And I was like, all right, fair.

04:46.140 --> 04:47.140
You made a good point.

04:47.140 --> 04:52.260
So I went and saw the Power Rangers just kind of approaching it as a Marvel movie because

04:52.260 --> 04:54.340
that's clearly what they wanted it to be.

04:54.340 --> 04:55.860
They're clearly trying to make a Marvel franchise.

04:55.860 --> 04:58.500
Everybody's trying to make a Marvel franchise now, right?

04:58.500 --> 05:01.980
So I saw it and I didn't think it was that bad.

05:01.980 --> 05:08.540
I felt that like one character was way better developed than the other four, but I'm not

05:08.540 --> 05:11.100
going to be spoilery, but I just, it was very obvious.

05:11.100 --> 05:15.580
Like one character was like really, really well developed and like, you know, the audience

05:15.580 --> 05:19.160
really like sympathizes with this person who gets into it and all this stuff.

05:19.160 --> 05:22.520
And then the other four are just kind of like, oh yeah, here's our little one note things

05:22.520 --> 05:24.740
that make us unique and that whole thing.

05:24.740 --> 05:28.420
So and I liked Rita Repulsa.

05:28.420 --> 05:33.120
I like Elizabeth Banks as Rita Repulsa, even though it's like totally not the campy version

05:33.120 --> 05:34.340
from the nineties TV show.

05:34.340 --> 05:38.140
Cause I do remember that I've seen enough of the show to know that, uh, totally different.

05:38.140 --> 05:41.620
But like, I like seeing Elizabeth banks in a different role and I think she kind of knew

05:41.620 --> 05:43.260
what movie she was in.

05:43.260 --> 05:46.480
Like, you know, she, she knew what it was, so she had fun with it.

05:46.480 --> 05:50.960
So look, I know it's, I know it's not a movie podcast, it's a video game podcast, but it's

05:50.960 --> 05:54.100
inevitable that the two worlds collide once in a while.

05:54.100 --> 05:55.100
Right?

05:55.100 --> 05:56.100
Yeah, exactly.

05:56.300 --> 06:00.780
So you might be wondering why I have not introduced yet tonight, Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers.

06:00.780 --> 06:03.280
Sadly, she is not here on tonight's show.

06:03.280 --> 06:06.620
And I know she's very frustrated because she wants to be here with you guys and she will

06:06.620 --> 06:09.300
join us on the Skype line a little later.

06:09.300 --> 06:11.460
But I asked her, I asked her if I could tell you guys what's going on.

06:11.460 --> 06:15.500
She said I could, so I'm not telling you all her business without getting permission first.

06:15.500 --> 06:17.980
But she ended up in the hospital this week.

06:17.980 --> 06:22.020
She had kidney stone, which if any y'all have ever gone through that, you know, they're

06:22.020 --> 06:23.340
no fun at all.

06:23.340 --> 06:28.420
My understanding is it was not large enough to qualify for the little sound thingy that

06:28.420 --> 06:29.560
they usually do.

06:29.560 --> 06:33.200
So she is currently waiting for nature to take its course.

06:33.200 --> 06:35.680
And so she obviously didn't want to do that here.

06:35.680 --> 06:37.200
So fair enough.

06:37.200 --> 06:41.860
So anyway, we send Get Well vibes to Dark Sakura, who I think has been dealing with

06:41.860 --> 06:44.760
a multitude of afflictions since the beginning of the year.

06:44.760 --> 06:49.640
So I want to put that poor girl in the bubble when she's better.

06:49.640 --> 06:51.940
Stay safe, Dark Sakura 2017.

06:51.940 --> 06:55.020
So anyway, we will hear from her a little later in the show.

06:55.020 --> 06:56.580
She's going to call in.

06:56.580 --> 06:59.980
And if she happens to be listening, there's a lot of folks in chat that are sending their

06:59.980 --> 07:01.480
well wishes.

07:01.480 --> 07:05.900
Because again, we do tape live and you can join us at live.vognetwork.com, which Stapi

07:05.900 --> 07:06.900
says that sucks.

07:06.900 --> 07:10.340
And come on, Noel Gus says, oh, no, that sucks, poor Dark Sakura.

07:10.340 --> 07:13.580
And on Mass Effect week two, right, right?

07:13.580 --> 07:18.100
That's what I was hoping to get into at the top of the show this week, was talking a little

07:18.100 --> 07:20.180
bit about the Mass Effect Andromeda launch.

07:20.820 --> 07:22.700
So here's the other funny thing going on this week.

07:22.700 --> 07:27.180
I mean, I don't know if it's the Mass Effect launch to blame for this or what's going on,

07:27.180 --> 07:29.180
but like everything's broken, you guys.

07:29.180 --> 07:33.740
So since we're doing that maintenance, right, over at vognetwork.com, that kind of kept

07:33.740 --> 07:38.940
the website going up and down at the time that I usually go in to produce an episode

07:38.940 --> 07:39.940
of the show.

07:39.940 --> 07:43.680
We don't script the show, obviously, but we do like to have a nice little outline that

07:43.680 --> 07:46.860
says Loki's going to talk about this, then Jamie's going to talk about this.

07:46.860 --> 07:50.140
We like to have a nice little outline so we don't step on each other's feet and, you know,

07:50.140 --> 07:53.660
talk about things twice and so forth, so there's a little order to the show.

07:53.660 --> 07:57.060
Yeah, couldn't do that tonight because of the maintenance.

07:57.060 --> 08:01.420
Oops, I didn't, and they told us about the maintenance on Thursday, but I wasn't thinking

08:01.420 --> 08:05.100
at that time, oh, Rob, you're going to need to get in the website then so you can produce

08:05.100 --> 08:06.100
the night show.

08:06.100 --> 08:09.740
I'm just thinking, oh, good, it'll be done by five o'clock when Bobby's live and when

08:09.740 --> 08:13.020
we're live and so it won't really affect the listeners or whatever.

08:13.020 --> 08:17.820
So I don't know what we're going to talk about tonight.

08:17.820 --> 08:23.860
He's put some things together for us, though, and I've agreed to just shut up and comment

08:23.860 --> 08:28.380
tonight so that I'm not stealing stories from Loki and, you know, he can talk about whatever

08:28.380 --> 08:32.620
he wants, but if we did a kickoff topic tonight, I probably would have wanted to talk about

08:32.620 --> 08:36.900
Mass Effect Andromeda, but unfortunately, Dark Sakura's not here, but obviously that

08:36.900 --> 08:41.500
was a big release that has a lot of people's attention, although, Loki, you don't, I know

08:41.500 --> 08:44.860
you, you're not super into Mass Effect, but has anything about Andromeda kind of caught

08:44.860 --> 08:45.860
your eye?

08:45.860 --> 08:49.660
Well, I watched a 20 minute video of all the features.

08:49.660 --> 08:52.180
When you say features, you mean bugs, right?

08:52.180 --> 08:56.620
Well, it wasn't, some of it's bugs and some of it's just like story stuff that just doesn't

08:56.620 --> 09:01.820
make any sense and like, don't get me wrong, I mean, I've been playing a ton of Skyrim,

09:01.820 --> 09:11.380
so I'm well aware of bugs in games and stuff, but it's kind of like, you know, harming the

09:11.380 --> 09:15.060
series, I think, you know, the fact that this is the quality that's coming out and you kind

09:15.060 --> 09:19.220
of wonder, like, and I know there's been a lot of people, you know, developers and animators

09:19.220 --> 09:22.660
and stuff that have come out in defense of it, it's like, the animation's hard.

09:22.660 --> 09:28.900
I get that, but why wasn't it hard for three, two, and one, you know, and now all of a sudden

09:28.900 --> 09:30.300
it's really hard.

09:30.300 --> 09:33.580
It's just like, especially when you look at like the previous game, it's like, holy shit,

09:33.580 --> 09:40.980
you know, there's been a very severe downgrade in the quality of, you know, even the facial

09:40.980 --> 09:46.620
appearance and everything versus like the other games, but I don't know, some of the

09:46.620 --> 09:50.380
like story stuff didn't seem to make any sense, like the reactions were just like kind of,

09:50.380 --> 09:53.060
like they dial, phoned it in, I guess.

09:53.060 --> 09:57.340
Here's the thing, I agree with you and I don't, like, now that I've spent, and I've spent

09:57.340 --> 10:01.220
a good, like, I think I've spent 20 hours, I think is what the clock is up to, and I'm

10:01.220 --> 10:06.180
only like 23% or something all the way through the game, like, I've probably barely scratched

10:06.180 --> 10:09.500
the surface on this, and that's not even counting multiplayer, that's just my single player

10:09.500 --> 10:10.500
file.

10:11.020 --> 10:14.260
That's not even counting, I've probably spent easy another four hours on multiplayer so

10:14.260 --> 10:17.060
far, but anyway, I agree and I don't agree.

10:17.060 --> 10:21.300
I think at the end of the day for me, Mass Effect, and you guys know I'm a fan of the

10:21.300 --> 10:25.620
series and have been very vocal of how much I enjoy this series, so if you want to claim

10:25.620 --> 10:29.740
that my opinion is biased, I'm using my quotey fingers, then fine.

10:29.740 --> 10:32.860
But I can also recognize that this game is not a 10 out of 10.

10:32.860 --> 10:36.260
This, Mass Effect Andromeda is not going to be a 10 out of 10.

10:36.300 --> 10:40.740
I don't think, though, it's 7.5 or whatever Metacritic's saying out of 10 either.

10:40.740 --> 10:44.460
We talked about the whole critic thing last week, I'm not going to double-talk that too

10:44.460 --> 10:50.500
much, but I think the internet is giving this a little bit too much shit unnecessarily.

10:50.500 --> 10:56.860
Yes, there are bugs in the game, clearly well-documented by some of these gifs and YouTubes and things,

10:56.860 --> 11:01.140
but like you said, there's a lot of games out there that have bugs in them when they

11:01.140 --> 11:04.540
come out and then we hail them as game of the year, Skyrim.

11:04.540 --> 11:08.660
Not that I'm excusing the bugs and all that, it's an issue, and it's one of Mass Effect

11:08.660 --> 11:14.020
Andromeda's biggest issues, and what I feel is keeping Mass Effect Andromeda from being

11:14.020 --> 11:19.260
a 10 out of 10 game, whereas Zelda Breath of the Wild is a 10 out of 10 game.

11:19.260 --> 11:26.740
Yeah, and I think it comes to fandom again, that 10 out of 10 for Zelda, I think a lot

11:26.740 --> 11:32.260
of these reviews overlooked those bugs, whereas in Mass Effect, they definitely paid attention

11:32.260 --> 11:33.260
to the bugs.

11:33.260 --> 11:38.180
Yes, yes, thank you for saying that, because I absolutely believe some of that is coming

11:38.180 --> 11:39.180
into play.

11:39.180 --> 11:44.180
And I don't want to turn to the darker things on the internet, and the whole social justice

11:44.180 --> 11:46.540
warrior versus Twitter and all this-

11:46.540 --> 11:48.580
I don't understand that complaint at all.

11:48.580 --> 11:52.060
I don't, like, fucking quit it!

11:52.060 --> 11:58.900
I'm not even going to say much more than that, my eyes roll to the back of my head so far

11:58.900 --> 11:59.900
I can see my brain.

11:59.900 --> 12:02.020
What was the complaint about it, was it that they're saying that because the social justice

12:02.020 --> 12:05.580
warriors were involved in it, that's why the facial animations were terrible, or are

12:05.580 --> 12:07.860
they talking about being able to romance people of different genders?

12:07.860 --> 12:12.060
I'm not even fucking sure, something about Bioware needing to pander to-

12:12.060 --> 12:18.100
Oh, I remember the stupid argument, they wanted to make the characters uglier because apparently

12:18.100 --> 12:22.220
social justice warriors are uglier or something, and so it's the pander-

12:22.220 --> 12:23.220
What?!

12:23.220 --> 12:27.580
I don't know, the whole argument was very stupid, so I was just like, whatever, I don't

12:27.580 --> 12:29.140
understand what the point of this is, but-

12:29.140 --> 12:35.140
I fucking can't, and I know it's a radio show, but I am using my hand to throw that out of

12:35.140 --> 12:38.460
the ballpark because I don't give a fuck about all of that.

12:38.460 --> 12:42.060
I don't understand what they were trying to accomplish with the argument, and I don't

12:42.060 --> 12:46.780
understand how social justice warriors even come into play at all with this, but whatever.

12:46.780 --> 12:50.260
I'm gonna tell you what it is, I'm gonna tell you what it is with the whole animations and

12:50.260 --> 12:51.260
all of it.

12:51.260 --> 12:56.600
And again, why Zelda is a 10 out of 10 game, and why Mass Effect Andromeda is not, okay?

12:56.600 --> 13:01.740
The reason is, Mass Effect Andromeda should have been delayed, again.

13:01.740 --> 13:06.360
And I know, out of a 5 year development cycle, and right at the end of the fiscal year, that's

13:06.360 --> 13:09.680
the last thing you want to hear a fan of the series who's been very adamant about waiting

13:09.680 --> 13:12.760
for this game a long time to say, but that's the reality.

13:12.760 --> 13:17.920
Because when they delayed Zelda, ain't nobody noting now that Zelda should have been a holiday

13:17.920 --> 13:24.760
2016 game, because everybody's losing their shit over it, because it's really good, and

13:25.040 --> 13:30.560
what draws a lot of people into Zelda are those little intricacies, right?

13:30.560 --> 13:36.560
That cute little fucking dog that chases its tail, the fact that when you walk towards

13:36.560 --> 13:41.000
the edge of a bridge, the guardsmen will say, no, don't do it, don't jump.

13:41.000 --> 13:45.140
Like those little intricacies in the animations and things like that, that could only be done

13:45.140 --> 13:51.020
because Zelda had time to cook in the oven until it was absolutely finished.

13:51.140 --> 13:56.980
Mass Effect Andromeda did not, and that is what's very clear about this game.

13:56.980 --> 14:03.980
Because as I'm playing it, I'm going, did anyone at BioWare play this game from start

14:04.820 --> 14:06.380
to finish?

14:06.380 --> 14:10.660
Because a lot of these issues would have been very obvious, and I'm actually not even talking

14:10.660 --> 14:15.700
about the animations and that stuff, I'm gonna be honest, that stuff honestly doesn't bother

14:15.700 --> 14:19.740
me the way it seems to be bothering a lot of people, because I don't really notice it.

14:19.780 --> 14:24.860
I'm not fixating in on five seconds that went wrong out of 20 hours that I've been playing.

14:24.860 --> 14:28.980
Yes, I noticed in one scene my character was floating when he shouldn't have been.

14:28.980 --> 14:31.100
That was really weird, okay?

14:31.100 --> 14:35.580
But okay, it happened one time out of 20 hours, and I kind of just forgot about it and I moved

14:35.580 --> 14:36.540
on.

14:36.540 --> 14:42.180
But there's other weird shit that happens too, like for example, and I'm gonna choose

14:42.180 --> 14:46.880
my words very carefully here because I'm trying to stay spoiler free, but in the beginning

14:46.920 --> 14:52.160
of the game you go to a planet, and you might stay on that planet for a while and then obviously

14:52.160 --> 14:56.040
the story is gonna take you to another planet, that's what you expect in a sci-fi game, right?

14:56.040 --> 15:02.720
Well you can go back to this planet and continue to do work on this planet to go even further.

15:02.720 --> 15:08.400
Well at one point I did that, I went back to that planet and I did like just about everything

15:08.400 --> 15:13.160
you could do on that planet, or at least when the game gave me a trophy for doing enough

15:13.160 --> 15:14.160
on that planet.

15:14.160 --> 15:15.160
Wink, nudge.

15:15.360 --> 15:18.760
I'm trying to stay very spoiler free.

15:18.760 --> 15:22.120
So then when I go to this other planet I then progress the story and I'm doing all this

15:22.120 --> 15:25.560
stuff and then my crew members go, hey, did you hear?

15:25.560 --> 15:30.320
The base over at the one planet had the problems fixed with the radiation, we should go back

15:30.320 --> 15:31.560
and see what's going on.

15:31.560 --> 15:35.200
And I'm like, I fucking did that two hours ago, like why are you just now having this

15:35.200 --> 15:36.200
conversation?

15:36.200 --> 15:40.280
Okay, let me bring this back to Skyrim.

15:40.360 --> 15:45.440
I heard they're reforming the Dawnguard, you know, some sort of vampire hunters or something.

15:45.440 --> 15:49.160
My god, every, you think Arrow to the Knee is fucking annoying?

15:49.160 --> 15:57.280
After that fucking DLC update, every fucking guard has to tell me about the fucking Dawnguard.

15:57.280 --> 16:02.320
It's like, yes, I'm fucking aware of this stupid castle that, you know, these group

16:02.320 --> 16:06.240
of people that fight vampires, it's like fucking shut up about it.

16:06.240 --> 16:08.360
And Shane was telling me he had a weird issue too.

16:08.360 --> 16:14.200
Like he had something where he went to the planet, the very first planet, and he met

16:14.200 --> 16:17.940
two people that are supposed to join your squad, but they hadn't joined yet.

16:17.940 --> 16:21.800
But then he went back to the ship, even though the story doesn't give you a reason to go

16:21.800 --> 16:25.280
back to the ship, he wanted to go back there because he felt he could progress one of the

16:25.280 --> 16:26.880
romance storylines.

16:26.880 --> 16:30.280
And those people who had not yet joined his squad on the ship.

16:30.280 --> 16:35.280
So there's like weird shit going on with the flags in the game that should be pretty obvious

16:35.320 --> 16:39.440
to anyone that played the game start to finish in some different ways, you know, which is

16:39.440 --> 16:40.800
what you do in QA.

16:40.800 --> 16:47.840
So, and I'm not blaming Bioware or EA's QA department, because my thought is, they're

16:47.840 --> 16:52.320
probably, these issues are probably well aware and documented, but there was a mandate that

16:52.320 --> 16:56.960
that game had to be out by the end of the financial year, and that was the mistake.

16:56.960 --> 17:03.000
Because even though it sounds like I'm being very negative on the game, I actually, like,

17:03.000 --> 17:04.520
it's pretty fucking amazing.

17:04.520 --> 17:10.640
Like the scope of the game, the scope of all there is to do in the game, and that's even

17:10.640 --> 17:13.440
without bringing multiplayer into it.

17:13.440 --> 17:18.440
And the vast variety of conversations you can have, and all this stuff that's going

17:18.440 --> 17:25.180
on, like, I actually feel like this is a incredibly epic game underneath all that shit that should

17:25.180 --> 17:29.400
have been better, like, underneath all that, it's a pretty amazing game.

17:29.400 --> 17:33.880
And so it kind of sucks that they rushed this out, because I think this game could have

17:33.920 --> 17:37.160
been a 10 out of 10 if it had come out holiday 2017.

17:37.160 --> 17:38.160
Probably.

17:38.160 --> 17:41.520
Because they would have had time to iron out the bucks, and it still very well could get

17:41.520 --> 17:44.240
better with bug patches and stuff like that.

17:44.240 --> 17:47.000
Yeah, but now, who's gonna care now?

17:47.000 --> 17:48.000
Because...

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
People care when they patch it in that new ending.

17:50.000 --> 17:54.400
A game kind of lives and dies by its, you know, release week, or what have you.

17:54.400 --> 17:57.900
Which, you know, for better or for worse, not that I necessarily agree with it, but,

17:57.900 --> 18:01.360
you know, will they slice the price of the game down to 30 bucks and then try to make

18:01.360 --> 18:02.360
the money on DLC?

18:02.360 --> 18:03.360
They already cut the price of the game.

18:03.360 --> 18:04.360
What?

18:04.360 --> 18:06.520
Yeah, I think they dropped about 24% of these.

18:06.520 --> 18:08.760
I saw an article somewhere that said that.

18:08.760 --> 18:11.000
Wow, that's something else if it's already dropped.

18:11.000 --> 18:16.880
I mean, but here's the other unfortunate thing, is that for those of you guys that are rooting

18:16.880 --> 18:21.160
for this game to fail, like, eat my entire ass.

18:21.160 --> 18:25.800
Like seriously, like, as a fan of Mass Effect, eat my ass.

18:25.800 --> 18:32.400
Because I don't want you guys to fuck this up and rob me of a sequel for Mass Effect

18:32.440 --> 18:33.440
Andromeda.

18:33.440 --> 18:38.720
Because I think back to the original trilogy and Mass Effect 1, 2, and 3.

18:38.720 --> 18:42.240
And Mass Effect 1 kind of had a lot of issues too.

18:42.240 --> 18:46.120
And especially when it came to driving, which this game has those same issues when it comes

18:46.120 --> 18:48.240
to driving, right?

18:48.240 --> 18:53.560
I feel like Mass Effect Andromeda 2 could be really, really fucking amazing, just like

18:53.560 --> 18:56.640
Mass Effect 2 was, and then the third game could be great too.

18:56.640 --> 19:00.320
But now I'm worried because of all of this fuckery that's going on on the internet, we're

19:00.320 --> 19:03.240
not going to get that, and that would be a tragedy.

19:03.240 --> 19:06.400
It would be a tragedy if we don't get a Mass Effect Andromeda 2.

19:06.400 --> 19:12.000
I hope they do it the right way, and I hope they give it the time it needs to develop,

19:12.000 --> 19:17.640
but I'm worried that all of this negativity is going to be a fucking snowball down the

19:17.640 --> 19:21.200
mountain, and we're not going to end up seeing a Mass Effect Andromeda 2 because of it.

19:21.200 --> 19:28.000
Because people, you know, were swayed by GIFs and ten second YouTube clips and things.

19:28.000 --> 19:29.880
We'll see what the sales do.

19:29.880 --> 19:31.720
Of what went wrong.

19:31.720 --> 19:34.680
And some of that onus is on EA as well, I don't think they should have done the ten

19:34.680 --> 19:36.520
hour preview.

19:36.520 --> 19:39.000
Especially if the game was only half done and a lot of these issues are going to come

19:39.000 --> 19:40.000
to light.

19:40.000 --> 19:46.040
You need to sell those thirty dollar passes to play, you know, games early.

19:46.040 --> 19:48.160
Pay for Violin Street Date.

19:48.160 --> 19:53.820
Okay, so going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com, Dungeon Buster I think really feels similarly

19:53.820 --> 19:58.400
to how I do, that says I could go on but it would sound like I actually hate the game,

19:58.400 --> 20:02.460
which weirdly I don't because there are things that I actually like in it, but damn, what

20:02.460 --> 20:05.280
the fuck happened to quality control?

20:05.280 --> 20:07.960
And that's exactly where my head's at right here.

20:07.960 --> 20:11.760
Tech2030 in chat says, is it the first game in a new trilogy?

20:11.760 --> 20:15.640
I would assume that is the plan, but we'll see.

20:15.640 --> 20:21.280
Dungeon Buster, with a hopeful comment that may make me feel a little better about things

20:21.280 --> 20:24.760
and what's happening on the internet, Dungeon Buster says, Assassin's Creed Unity hasn't

20:24.760 --> 20:27.880
stopped that franchise.

20:27.880 --> 20:30.120
I hope you're right, I hope you're onto something with that comment.

20:30.120 --> 20:38.600
It's okay, Mass Effect Andromeda, it was a development variation.

20:38.600 --> 20:42.000
There's other things I could kind of get into in Mass Effect as well, and I feel like I

20:42.000 --> 20:47.800
need to address some of these things, although I'm opening a whole can of worms, but I'm

20:47.800 --> 20:49.360
just going to fucking say it.

20:49.360 --> 20:52.520
So obviously there's a lot of controversy going on out there because, I don't know if

20:52.520 --> 20:55.280
you've heard about this, Loki, I know you probably don't follow all this as closely

20:55.280 --> 21:01.000
as I do, but you are aware that part of a big draw to Mass Effect games is that the

21:01.000 --> 21:06.800
subtitle should just be, Mass Effect Andromeda, who do I get to fuck?

21:06.800 --> 21:07.800
That's what a lot of these games are about.

21:07.800 --> 21:08.800
That's what people want to know.

21:08.800 --> 21:10.360
Who do you get to fuck?

21:10.360 --> 21:11.360
Is it everybody?

21:11.360 --> 21:12.360
No.

21:12.360 --> 21:13.360
No.

21:13.360 --> 21:19.800
And that's part of what's happening here, because as a player who wants to play a gay

21:19.800 --> 21:23.040
male shepherd, you have two romance options in the game.

21:23.040 --> 21:24.040
I hope that isn't spoilery.

21:24.080 --> 21:26.840
I'm sorry if, I'm very sorry if this is spoilery.

21:26.840 --> 21:27.840
Gay writer, I guess.

21:27.840 --> 21:29.960
I will not say who they are, okay?

21:29.960 --> 21:36.720
So gay writer has two options on who he can romance, and in one of the romance scenes,

21:36.720 --> 21:41.020
it does like a whole little flirtatious thing, and they're kind of like, they're kissing

21:41.020 --> 21:44.800
and stuff, and then they kind of get into bed, and it fades to black, right?

21:44.800 --> 21:49.040
The dot, dot, dot, and you know what happens after that.

21:49.040 --> 21:52.560
In one of the, I think there are, somebody may have to correct me on this number, I believe

21:52.680 --> 22:00.080
there are at least four heterosexual male love scenes, so females, there are four females

22:00.080 --> 22:01.080
you can romance, right?

22:01.080 --> 22:06.680
I'm thinking in my high mind, there's her, there's her, there's her, and I think there's

22:06.680 --> 22:07.680
one other.

22:07.680 --> 22:08.680
So I think there's at least four.

22:08.680 --> 22:09.680
I could be wrong.

22:09.680 --> 22:10.680
There might be more.

22:10.680 --> 22:11.680
Impressionator.

22:11.680 --> 22:17.420
So in one of the scenes that I caught on YouTube of what happens with the male heterosexual

22:17.420 --> 22:21.700
writer and one of the females, it's fucking porn.

22:21.700 --> 22:28.820
Like it is, her titties are out, his ass is on display, she's sitting up on the counter,

22:28.820 --> 22:32.540
he's pounding her, I'm not fucking kidding.

22:32.540 --> 22:35.180
That's the soft core porn in the game.

22:35.180 --> 22:43.820
Now look, I understand that anal might make some people uncomfortable, and I'm not saying

22:43.820 --> 22:49.020
that that whole thing necessarily needs to be on the same display and all this, but why

22:49.020 --> 22:50.020
is it?

22:50.020 --> 22:51.020
You can do it tastefully.

22:51.020 --> 22:55.140
You can do it tastefully, exactly, because that's what they're going to say about this

22:55.140 --> 23:00.900
whole male and female writer thing is that, well, it was done tastefully.

23:00.900 --> 23:03.900
It's a tasteful Cinemax scene.

23:03.900 --> 23:05.340
There's a discrepancy there.

23:05.340 --> 23:09.440
There's a discrepancy in how it was done, and there's a discrepancy in how many options

23:09.440 --> 23:11.380
you have.

23:11.420 --> 23:13.860
Gay men have yet to be able to fuck an alien.

23:13.860 --> 23:16.980
I just want to point that out.

23:16.980 --> 23:19.600
Straight men, not a problem since the very first game.

23:19.600 --> 23:24.620
You could have your way, it's well documented in Mass Effect 1, you can bed an asari character

23:24.620 --> 23:28.220
in that game, and that trend kind of continues on into this game.

23:28.220 --> 23:31.700
And there's female on female.

23:31.700 --> 23:32.940
Where are my gay women at?

23:32.940 --> 23:35.280
Hey, they have plenty of options as well.

23:35.280 --> 23:39.240
Gay women have, I think, the same four options.

23:39.240 --> 23:43.500
I'm sorry, I did not commit to memory all these different options, but gay women have

23:43.500 --> 23:48.360
more options than gay men do.

23:48.360 --> 23:53.880
By the way, there's a trophy in the game for romancing three different people throughout

23:53.880 --> 23:55.680
the course of the game.

23:55.680 --> 23:58.460
Now, think about that for a minute.

23:58.460 --> 24:02.680
How many did I just tell you gay writer gets to romance?

24:02.680 --> 24:03.800
Two.

24:03.800 --> 24:12.120
So you can't earn that trophy if you're gay writer, and of course, here's the witty retort,

24:12.120 --> 24:17.380
here comes the tweet from the egg icon on Twitter, well, you could still get the, you're

24:17.380 --> 24:22.000
not banned from getting the trophy, all you have to do is sleep with a woman.

24:22.000 --> 24:26.880
Right, because I haven't fucking heard that line over my 38 years of existence.

24:26.880 --> 24:28.280
Again, here's the spoon.

24:28.280 --> 24:31.240
It's just for the trophies, okay?

24:31.240 --> 24:32.240
It means nothing, but.

24:32.280 --> 24:36.080
And drama is about procreation, which is funny because they get into that whole thing, and

24:36.080 --> 24:39.840
I actually thought that part was well done because one of the gay characters feels a

24:39.840 --> 24:44.060
little bit of guilt about the fact that there's supposed to be procreation, but I actually

24:44.060 --> 24:46.240
thought that was well done, but I digress.

24:46.240 --> 24:53.720
So anyway, but here's my worry, and I understand there is a trans character in the game that's

24:53.720 --> 24:56.480
getting a lot of pushback as well.

24:56.480 --> 25:01.720
I am not trans myself, so I feel like I can't really present this in the same way about

25:01.720 --> 25:08.840
how this is offensive, but essentially, imagine it's this.

25:08.840 --> 25:13.560
So I'm gonna walk up to you, hey, Loki, how you doing today?

25:13.560 --> 25:16.680
By the way, did you know that I used to be a woman and my name was blank?

25:16.680 --> 25:22.480
Like that's kinda how it's done in Mass Effect Andromeda.

25:22.480 --> 25:26.440
That's the thing, it's like, I actually was, it was one of these videos that was complaining

25:26.440 --> 25:30.620
about the social justice stuff, and I happened to watch it, and they were talking about that

25:30.620 --> 25:34.180
this isn't the first game Bioware has done this, like they said they did that in Dragon

25:34.180 --> 25:40.080
Age Inquisition as well, like one of the characters you meet, she's just like, hi, I'm such and

25:40.080 --> 25:45.580
such, IP standing up, it's like, where the fuck did that come from?

25:45.580 --> 25:47.440
Just ridiculous stuff.

25:47.440 --> 25:52.980
So it's something that they've done in previous games, but it's like, kind of almost seems

25:52.980 --> 25:57.780
like that they're doing it not to be progressive, it's just like, oh, we're just ticking the

25:57.780 --> 26:02.220
box because we wanna make sure this market's being taken care of.

26:02.220 --> 26:09.100
Funny enough, even though that might not be the best way to come to that conclusion, but

26:09.100 --> 26:14.340
I feel like that's kinda it, like this is where a lot of people who appreciate the diversity

26:14.340 --> 26:18.060
or have in the past that Bioware's been trying to go for in some of these games are getting

26:18.060 --> 26:22.060
a little annoyed, because now it's starting to feel like we're ticking boxes.

26:22.060 --> 26:27.300
And again, I'm not trans myself, but so you guys understand, if you don't happen to know

26:27.300 --> 26:32.820
anybody who's trans, what I'm told is to just come out and blurt what they call your

26:32.820 --> 26:33.820
dead name.

26:33.820 --> 26:40.620
Essentially, that was the name before you transitioned, right?

26:40.620 --> 26:42.540
That's like something that doesn't fucking happen.

26:42.540 --> 26:45.980
Like you don't go up to somebody and just say like, hi, did you know my name used to

26:45.980 --> 26:46.980
be blank?

26:46.980 --> 26:48.980
Like that's just not the way it works.

26:48.980 --> 26:55.980
But you have to wonder, and again, if we happen to have any trans people out there listening,

26:55.980 --> 27:00.000
I would love to hear your perspective on this, if you're okay with the way it was done,

27:00.000 --> 27:04.860
or if it pisses you off and why, because I would like to hear from that perspective,

27:04.860 --> 27:09.580
but I'm trying to represent you all the best I can.

27:09.580 --> 27:17.860
But this whole thing is like, did they have to do it that way so that maybe the people

27:17.860 --> 27:22.540
who don't know somebody who's trans or who doesn't have that in their life would not

27:22.540 --> 27:25.140
be able to get confused?

27:25.140 --> 27:34.700
I mean, I don't know, and I'm not saying that's how they should have done it at all.

27:34.700 --> 27:39.020
I'm just like, who thought that was a good idea?

27:39.020 --> 27:44.620
That was just a weird way to do it, or at least get to know that character a little

27:44.620 --> 27:46.540
bit first.

27:46.540 --> 27:51.380
Make that character, I mean, heaven forbid we go there, make that character a romanceable

27:51.380 --> 27:52.380
option.

27:52.380 --> 27:56.060
And when you get to know that character more and more, then maybe she unveils a little

27:56.060 --> 28:01.340
bit more about her past, doesn't necessarily blurt out what her name used to be, but maybe

28:01.340 --> 28:07.100
explains a little more about what, oh my God, can you imagine some of those egg icons on

28:07.100 --> 28:08.100
Twitter?

28:08.100 --> 28:13.100
What would happen if like, oh yeah, and see, then the problem is like, oh, hey, I romance

28:13.100 --> 28:15.580
this hot female and you can guess what happened.

28:15.580 --> 28:21.060
But that plays into another really bad trope that I can understand why Bioware would not

28:21.060 --> 28:25.860
want to go down that road, because, you know, that's a whole slippery slope of its own.

28:25.860 --> 28:29.940
Or here's what you could have done in the first place, why the fuck did you even have,

28:29.940 --> 28:31.860
like, why the fuck did you decide in this game?

28:31.860 --> 28:34.500
Yeah, we're gonna let you fuck the crew members.

28:34.500 --> 28:37.440
Why even have that in a sci-fi game?

28:37.440 --> 28:40.620
Why are we even bringing sexuality into these games in the first place?

28:40.620 --> 28:44.900
Just have it be a game without, like, who cares?

28:44.900 --> 28:49.460
Because in a two-hour movie that's dramatic, sometimes the characters have sex, Loki.

28:49.460 --> 28:56.020
Like, it's the same thing in space, in a 60-hour plus epic game about drama, sometimes

28:56.020 --> 28:58.180
you get closer to the characters and sometimes you have sex with them.

28:58.180 --> 28:59.180
Like that's what it is.

28:59.180 --> 29:04.340
You just fucking do it the Saints Row four way, which is, you can fuck everyone.

29:04.340 --> 29:05.900
That's it.

29:05.900 --> 29:12.060
Okay, going to chat over at live.voggenetwork.com, let's see, William Murderface says, I know

29:12.060 --> 29:17.740
a couple people who are, and I think mentioning trans, and yeah, many don't tend to talk about

29:17.740 --> 29:18.780
their dead names.

29:18.780 --> 29:22.580
Of course, there are some who just don't give a fuck, but they seem to be a statistical

29:22.580 --> 29:24.740
anomalies in that regard.

29:24.740 --> 29:26.720
Dungeon Buster, I think, sums it up very well here.

29:26.720 --> 29:27.720
This is nice.

29:27.720 --> 29:31.940
The writing could have opened up more opportunities to learn more about that specific character

29:31.940 --> 29:34.900
instead of just putting out a verbal billboard.

29:34.900 --> 29:38.820
And Alex P. Carson answering your question, Loki says, sex.

29:38.820 --> 29:39.820
Just because.

29:39.820 --> 29:40.820
Sex.

29:40.820 --> 29:41.820
Sex sounds like it.

29:41.820 --> 29:45.100
I get it, but if they're not gonna do it smart, then what's the point, you know?

29:45.100 --> 29:47.740
Don't implement a feature you can't implement correctly.

29:47.780 --> 29:53.380
Alright, so anyway, I had to mention some of those issues, and here's...

29:53.380 --> 29:58.220
And yes, I didn't like Saints Row IV, not because you could romance everybody, because

29:58.220 --> 30:04.620
I get the parody of that, but because it's not fucking Saints Row, it's just ridiculous

30:04.620 --> 30:06.100
bullshit, the game.

30:06.100 --> 30:10.260
Speaking of parody games, you posted that trailer on Twitter this week for that goat

30:10.260 --> 30:13.660
simulator game, the goat simulator in space or whatever.

30:13.660 --> 30:16.460
That looked fucking hilarious.

30:16.460 --> 30:20.220
It was hitting on everything that Mass Effect is known for, including the romance scenes,

30:20.220 --> 30:26.700
and I was like, well, brava, goat simulator developers, brava on you.

30:26.700 --> 30:28.300
I'm excited to play that at some point.

30:28.300 --> 30:29.620
I think it came out this week, actually.

30:29.620 --> 30:30.620
Oh, did it come out this week?

30:30.620 --> 30:31.620
The DLC, yeah.

30:31.620 --> 30:32.620
I'm gonna have to check that out.

30:32.620 --> 30:33.620
Here's...

30:33.620 --> 30:37.100
Okay, this is the one other thing I want to say with all this social justice stuff and

30:37.100 --> 30:43.060
all the trans representation and the gay male representation and so forth, is there's a

30:43.060 --> 30:46.820
lot of this negativity that BioWare is getting in the reception because they should have

30:46.820 --> 30:50.820
done better rather than just tick a box.

30:50.820 --> 30:56.880
My concern is, are they going to then not do this in the future?

30:56.880 --> 31:00.520
Because they're gonna say like, well, if we put a trans character or we put a gay character

31:00.520 --> 31:04.780
or we put a XYZ character in the game, we're just gonna get all this hate mail, so next

31:04.780 --> 31:05.960
time we're not gonna bother.

31:05.960 --> 31:09.780
Try harder then, instead of just giving up because you failed the first time.

31:09.780 --> 31:10.780
You gotta fail fast.

31:10.780 --> 31:14.860
You gotta just, you try something, you take your feedback, you make it better.

31:14.860 --> 31:16.900
Not just, oh, people didn't like it.

31:16.900 --> 31:18.220
Well, too fucking bad.

31:18.220 --> 31:19.220
You know what?

31:19.220 --> 31:20.760
You try harder next time.

31:20.760 --> 31:22.380
I am fucking proud of you, Loki.

31:22.380 --> 31:23.500
Give me a high five.

31:23.500 --> 31:30.300
That was, I, guys, that was Loki that just gave that statement.

31:30.300 --> 31:34.300
You know, for every person that comes to me and says, when is Loki gonna shut the fuck

31:34.300 --> 31:35.620
up about Nintendo?

31:35.620 --> 31:36.620
Never.

31:36.620 --> 31:39.460
I'm gonna play that back because you're okay, Loki.

31:39.460 --> 31:41.020
At the end of the day, you're okay.

31:41.020 --> 31:45.660
But it's, I mean, seriously, it's, I think the frustrates me the most about some people

31:45.660 --> 31:48.620
is just like, willing to give up so easily.

31:48.620 --> 31:52.820
It's just, why don't you just take the feedback from it and learn from it?

31:52.820 --> 31:57.780
There's always gonna be people, you can't appease everyone, but do it in a way that

31:57.780 --> 32:03.420
makes sense instead of just, hi, my name is, you know, so and so.

32:03.420 --> 32:04.780
Did you know I used to have a penis?

32:04.780 --> 32:07.940
I mean, like, that's stupid, you know, just have them.

32:07.940 --> 32:12.500
Nobody does that, or at least very few people probably do that.

32:12.500 --> 32:19.500
But I just think there's easier ways to just develop it and more naturally, better writing.

32:19.500 --> 32:20.500
Get better writers.

32:20.500 --> 32:23.500
So, and here's, here's the thing.

32:23.500 --> 32:25.700
I mean, as much as, how long has the show been on now?

32:25.700 --> 32:26.700
Half an hour.

32:26.700 --> 32:29.900
We've been talking about Mass Effect for half an hour.

32:29.900 --> 32:30.900
It's like Jamie's here.

32:30.900 --> 32:34.780
And it's, well, to be fair, I'm as bad as she is.

32:34.780 --> 32:37.780
And for the most part, we've been shitting on a lot of elements of Mass Effect.

32:37.780 --> 32:41.780
But I want to stress, there's a lot of good in Mass Effect.

32:41.780 --> 32:44.860
There's a lot, a lot of, lot of good.

32:44.860 --> 32:52.220
But it's extraordinarily frustrating to see these things that flopped, that could have

32:52.220 --> 32:56.940
been fixed if the game had just gone through another few months of quality check.

32:56.940 --> 33:00.540
And at the end of the day, that's, that's what, like, even, even some of these things

33:00.540 --> 33:06.380
we're talking about with, with the representation of the different minorities, like, maybe if

33:06.380 --> 33:11.060
the game had had a longer QA period, they could have brought in some more gay men, some

33:11.060 --> 33:15.820
more trans individuals, some more, you know, to play the game and give that, give this

33:15.820 --> 33:18.300
feedback that now they're getting on Twitter.

33:18.300 --> 33:19.300
So.

33:19.300 --> 33:21.980
I would be surprised if they don't have that feedback already.

33:21.980 --> 33:22.980
I mean, cause come on.

33:22.980 --> 33:25.180
I mean, they've been doing this for how many games now?

33:25.180 --> 33:26.180
Yeah.

33:26.180 --> 33:28.340
Like, so that should be there.

33:28.340 --> 33:32.420
And I mean, I think EA is a pretty progressive company.

33:32.420 --> 33:33.420
They have staff for-

33:34.060 --> 33:38.060
To be fair, I know EA has gotten a lot of shit over the years, but EA was there at the

33:38.060 --> 33:45.160
very first GamerX, EA is in the pride parades, EA's, EA's, EA's trying to do the right thing.

33:45.160 --> 33:49.980
You know, so I, I can't believe I'm going to say it, but just, just go back to what

33:49.980 --> 33:55.100
Loki said a little bit ago, take the feedback and do better.

33:55.100 --> 33:56.100
There it is.

33:56.100 --> 34:00.940
Ah, uh, William Ritterface in chat says, isn't it the case that we often criticize that which

34:00.940 --> 34:05.940
we want to see succeed most, not because we hate it, but because we want it to do well.

34:05.940 --> 34:09.820
So this is not surprising, which by the way, since I just, I mentioned it, it's kind of

34:09.820 --> 34:14.860
a joke a minute ago, but it's, it's so the case again, listen to this, Loki, isn't it

34:14.860 --> 34:18.700
the case that we often criticize that which we want to see succeed most?

34:18.700 --> 34:19.700
Nintendo.

34:19.700 --> 34:20.700
Yes.

34:20.700 --> 34:26.100
It, well, we criticize Nintendo because we know that they're capable of better.

34:26.100 --> 34:27.660
And that's, that's the frustration.

34:27.660 --> 34:31.380
And it's like, dude, you used to be fucking phenomenal.

34:31.380 --> 34:33.940
There's their games were fucking phenomenal.

34:33.940 --> 34:38.260
And it's like now they're just hitting, they're like setting the bar so low for themselves.

34:38.260 --> 34:41.420
It's just like, come on you guys, I know you can do better.

34:41.420 --> 34:43.100
You got an A on the last report.

34:43.100 --> 34:45.900
Why are you getting C's now?

34:45.900 --> 34:49.020
That's kind of spoken like a true father.

34:49.020 --> 34:50.020
That's the thing.

34:50.020 --> 34:53.200
It's like my, my kids do this all the time and that's, you know, comes with the frustration

34:53.200 --> 34:56.900
of quitting because it's like, oh, I don't want to do this cause it's hard cause they

34:56.900 --> 34:57.900
got it wrong.

34:57.900 --> 34:58.900
Or I know I'm going to get it wrong.

34:58.900 --> 35:02.380
Well, you're not trying and that pisses me off even more than you failing.

35:02.380 --> 35:05.540
Well, not that pissing, not that you failing would piss me off.

35:05.540 --> 35:08.220
It's just, you know, try it.

35:08.220 --> 35:09.620
God damn it.

35:09.620 --> 35:14.600
Um, tiger Han chat says, sky, what do you think of games and comic book movies trying

35:14.600 --> 35:17.740
to shoehorn LGBT characters just to appeal?

35:17.740 --> 35:20.220
I think it's appeal, not appear to the demographic.

35:20.220 --> 35:22.900
Uh, yeah, that's quite obvious actually.

35:22.900 --> 35:24.980
I think here's the thing.

35:24.980 --> 35:28.540
I'll bring up the power Rangers movie cause that was all in the news, right?

35:28.540 --> 35:33.100
The fact like, OMG, it's the first like gay superhero or what have you, right?

35:33.100 --> 35:39.060
Like honestly, it's not, how do I phrase this?

35:39.060 --> 35:43.300
I want to say it's not a huge moment in the movie, although it kind of is during a key

35:43.300 --> 35:47.220
moment as to what is bringing these five individuals together and so forth.

35:47.220 --> 35:51.340
Um, so, but, but what, what I'm trying to say is that the, I don't want to say it's

35:51.340 --> 35:55.740
a throwaway line, but it's just one of those things that's kind of like quickly like, yeah,

35:55.740 --> 35:56.820
that's kind of what's going on.

35:56.820 --> 36:02.540
And then it's like we move on into the discussion and that's kind of, I don't know, in some

36:02.540 --> 36:09.540
ways, I kind of like that as when I tell people that I happen to be gay and I'm married to

36:09.540 --> 36:13.140
a man, I kind of like that they can just go, all right, cool.

36:13.140 --> 36:15.380
So do you guys have a cat?

36:15.380 --> 36:17.420
You know, like that's, that's it, right?

36:17.420 --> 36:21.860
Like that's, that's kind of how I prefer the conversations to go is that it's not a big

36:21.860 --> 36:22.860
fucking deal.

36:22.860 --> 36:25.900
Like if people have questions, I'm happy to answer as long as it comes from a place of

36:25.900 --> 36:26.900
education.

36:26.900 --> 36:32.340
But, you know, don't ask the question like, well, well, well, who's on top in that relationship?

36:32.340 --> 36:33.340
That's not your fucking business.

36:33.340 --> 36:34.420
It should be like that.

36:34.420 --> 36:38.900
It's just like if you saw an interracial couple, oh, your, your, your wife's black.

36:38.900 --> 36:40.780
I mean, like, so how's that work?

36:40.780 --> 36:46.220
I mean, like no one does that anymore because it's, it's such a, a normal thing and that's,

36:46.220 --> 36:47.220
well, well, okay.

36:47.260 --> 36:53.380
Most people don't, when I say everyone, I mean every sane person.

36:53.380 --> 36:56.580
So most people don't say that.

36:56.580 --> 36:58.460
It's like, it's not even a thing that you think about.

36:58.460 --> 37:01.180
And I think we're almost, we'll be there soon.

37:01.180 --> 37:03.540
You know, where it's just like, oh, you guys are married.

37:03.540 --> 37:04.540
Cool.

37:04.540 --> 37:05.540
I mean, that's it.

37:05.540 --> 37:07.540
I mean, that's how it should be.

37:07.540 --> 37:09.180
It shouldn't even be a thing.

37:09.180 --> 37:10.180
Yeah.

37:10.180 --> 37:11.180
I know.

37:11.180 --> 37:12.540
I'm trying to fantasize about people naked.

37:12.540 --> 37:19.700
So next time somebody, not, not that anybody's dumb enough to actually ask me who's on top

37:19.700 --> 37:20.700
in that relationship.

37:20.700 --> 37:24.060
I I'm going to, I mean, would you like to know, I'm trying to picture me naked.

37:24.060 --> 37:25.300
Do you want to just see me naked?

37:25.300 --> 37:27.420
Like is that what we're getting at here?

37:27.420 --> 37:28.740
Um, but okay.

37:28.740 --> 37:30.460
So back to the whole power ranger thing, right?

37:30.460 --> 37:33.620
So actually the way they did it in the movie was fine.

37:33.620 --> 37:41.100
It's the whole fucking internet fuck fest that's going on on like the whole, like, oh

37:41.100 --> 37:44.860
my God, it's a lesbian power ranger.

37:44.860 --> 37:49.540
They, this whole big thing is so this stuff that's going on and the fact that it's like

37:49.540 --> 37:54.260
a adult rated movie in Russia and all this stuff is going on, that's just kind of like,

37:54.260 --> 37:58.060
that's the part where I'm going like, fucking calm down.

37:58.060 --> 38:00.060
It's 2017.

38:00.060 --> 38:01.140
Don't get me wrong.

38:01.140 --> 38:03.340
I appreciate the representation.

38:03.340 --> 38:10.140
I think it's fucking fantastic that this ranger can say, yeah, I'm having girlfriend problems.

38:10.180 --> 38:12.300
And the other rangers are like, okay, cool.

38:12.300 --> 38:14.580
And, and like moving on, like I'm cool.

38:14.580 --> 38:20.980
And so that way, if there is a little girl out there who has some, well, you know, I

38:20.980 --> 38:24.260
need to choose my words carefully here because nobody under a certain age should probably

38:24.260 --> 38:27.700
be having romantic feelings of any kind, but you know, a teenage, when I say a little,

38:27.700 --> 38:32.940
I mean like a teenage girl, who's the age in the movie is having these conflicting feelings.

38:32.940 --> 38:35.980
Being able to see some of that representation, like, oh fuck, there's like somebody like

38:35.980 --> 38:37.380
me out there.

38:37.380 --> 38:38.380
Right.

38:38.900 --> 38:43.580
And this is a battle that continues on for racial minorities too.

38:43.580 --> 38:47.780
And that whole thing, like, you know, why did we have this whole thing with the Oscars

38:47.780 --> 38:52.620
a couple of years ago, where it was the Oscar so white and all this stuff, because, you

38:52.620 --> 38:57.940
know, I think a lot of black individuals like to see themselves in movies and there was

38:57.940 --> 39:04.340
a lot of great talent and great movies that were going extremely like unrecognized and

39:04.340 --> 39:05.340
so forth.

39:06.220 --> 39:13.460
A lot changed for the better this year, but I would, I would, we're not there yet, but

39:13.460 --> 39:18.020
things are going in the right direction where now we are acknowledging and hopefully at

39:18.020 --> 39:25.340
the end of the day, opening up more roles for people that are not just like white men.

39:25.340 --> 39:27.100
You know, that's, that's what it is.

39:27.100 --> 39:30.940
Anyway, I don't want to get too preachy on the show, but that's, you know how it goes.

39:30.940 --> 39:33.420
Go into chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

39:33.420 --> 39:36.540
Tiger claw and chat says, sky, you heard the internet is going ape shit over wonder

39:36.540 --> 39:38.300
woman's armpit.

39:38.300 --> 39:39.300
What the fuck?

39:39.300 --> 39:40.300
No.

39:40.300 --> 39:41.300
What does she not shave it or something?

39:41.300 --> 39:42.940
Is that a thing?

39:42.940 --> 39:43.940
Gives a shit.

39:43.940 --> 39:46.060
Who's actually free streaming that shit to check.

39:46.060 --> 39:50.820
If she grew up in the fucking jungle, I would think that she probably doesn't shave her

39:50.820 --> 39:55.300
armpit and that's probably historically accurate, which I can't believe I'm saying about a comic

39:55.300 --> 39:56.300
book movie.

39:56.300 --> 39:59.860
But I mean, yeah, somebody's got too much time on their hands.

39:59.860 --> 40:00.860
You know why?

40:00.860 --> 40:03.020
You know why somebody noticed it?

40:03.020 --> 40:06.940
Because it took them out of the sexualization of wonder woman for a minute.

40:06.940 --> 40:10.220
Like I can't fap to her now.

40:10.220 --> 40:16.380
She doesn't, she doesn't, she doesn't buy these products to, to conform to some sort

40:16.380 --> 40:18.180
of standard that magazines has put out there.

40:18.180 --> 40:21.060
I can't fap to her anymore.

40:21.060 --> 40:22.460
That's why somebody noticed it.

40:22.460 --> 40:25.940
Once again, people just giving up before they actually try.

40:25.940 --> 40:26.940
Oh, is it?

40:26.940 --> 40:28.620
Oh, Brad's telling me it's the other way around.

40:28.620 --> 40:30.020
It's because she does shave.

40:30.180 --> 40:31.180
Oh my God.

40:31.180 --> 40:33.500
No one is fucking happy about anything.

40:33.500 --> 40:34.500
Nobody's happy with anything.

40:34.500 --> 40:35.500
Who cares?

40:35.500 --> 40:39.500
Again, stop staring at her armpits.

40:39.500 --> 40:40.500
It's okay.

40:40.500 --> 40:43.020
Cause she has a massive bush under her fucking costume.

40:43.020 --> 40:46.940
See, it's just, it's, it's even now.

40:46.940 --> 40:48.940
Okay.

40:48.940 --> 40:52.460
God, people are so complaining.

40:52.460 --> 40:56.780
I swear people just want to fucking complain about anything on the internet because they'll

40:56.780 --> 40:58.940
get fucking attention for it.

40:59.380 --> 41:01.380
It's like everything.

41:08.100 --> 41:09.540
I broke Rob.

41:12.660 --> 41:14.580
I think we need to move on.

41:14.580 --> 41:16.180
All right, let's do that.

41:16.180 --> 41:19.220
Uh, wait, we need to talk about other games we've been playing this week besides just

41:19.220 --> 41:23.140
Mass Effect and the same man called How Was Your Game?

41:23.140 --> 41:24.740
Loki, how was your gaming week?

41:24.740 --> 41:29.540
Um, so this week I actually played, well, I was going to play more, um, Zelda, but you

41:29.540 --> 41:32.340
know, honestly, I haven't felt compelled to do it.

41:32.340 --> 41:36.420
That weapon, you know, the weapon damage to something is really bothering me.

41:36.420 --> 41:38.460
So I just, I haven't gotten around to it.

41:38.460 --> 41:43.420
Um, instead I played more Skyrim, so I made it through which storylines now?

41:43.420 --> 41:48.140
So I went through the rest of the actual Civil War storylines.

41:48.140 --> 41:49.140
That's all done.

41:49.140 --> 41:57.100
Um, I think I did, um, I can't remember if I had finished the whole actual, like, Dragonborn,

41:57.100 --> 42:02.820
not the DLC Dragonborn storyline, but the actual All the Winds storyline in the game.

42:02.820 --> 42:04.140
So I did that.

42:04.140 --> 42:09.220
Um, I started doing the Bard stuff now, which is completely boring, but I'm going to get

42:09.220 --> 42:10.220
through that pretty quick.

42:10.220 --> 42:15.060
And then it's going to be on to Dawnguard because I figure if I complete the Dawnguard

42:15.060 --> 42:19.860
DLC, then they can stop fucking telling me about stupid Dawnguard, and that's really

42:19.860 --> 42:22.420
my only motivation to finish that DLC.

42:22.420 --> 42:25.340
So I finished it before when I had mods on there, but now that I'm playing a whole new

42:25.340 --> 42:30.060
save, I got to do it again, but my god, it's seriously irritating.

42:30.060 --> 42:33.700
Um, so then the other thing I've been doing, um, like, because I was unaware that they

42:33.700 --> 42:37.140
have this going on, this whole water festival thing in Pokemon, I just thought, like, this

42:37.140 --> 42:39.820
is a weird glitch, that there's, like, fish everywhere.

42:39.820 --> 42:43.060
And so then finally I read up, oh, it's an event going on.

42:43.060 --> 42:47.740
So I thought the game was just broken, which, you know, wouldn't be that far off.

42:47.740 --> 42:52.820
So I've been playing quite a bit to get, um, you know, as many new Pokemon as I can, because,

42:52.820 --> 42:56.880
you know, I don't normally go near water, I'm not going to San Francisco or anything,

42:56.880 --> 43:00.980
so a lot of these are brand new for my stuff, and it just, it's a good way to kill time

43:00.980 --> 43:05.380
when I have to sit at a birthday party, for example, like I did today.

43:05.380 --> 43:08.740
Um, and then what else did I play?

43:08.740 --> 43:16.460
Um, I played briefly, because I installed it for my son, Super Mario Run, on Android,

43:16.460 --> 43:21.540
so I put it on his tablet for him, and the only thing that really pisses me off about

43:21.540 --> 43:25.700
Super Mario Run is the forced tutorial that they have in the beginning, because all I

43:25.700 --> 43:30.380
wanted to do was, like, quickly install it on there, and just pay for it so that the

43:30.380 --> 43:33.780
app is unlocked, and then go, and let my son just play the game.

43:33.780 --> 43:38.060
But no, I had to do, they had to show me every fucking element from the stupid game, it took

43:38.100 --> 43:43.500
for goddamn ever just to finish the thing, and it plays okay, I just don't, it's not

43:43.500 --> 43:47.140
a game I'm interested in, he really loves it, he's been playing it, like, all the last

43:47.140 --> 43:51.340
two days, so, um, you know, he got that going for him, plus it's easy enough for him to

43:51.340 --> 43:54.860
be able to play, you know, he's just like, oh, I really like the fact that I can play

43:54.860 --> 43:59.060
this, you know, because, um, he can put the easy mode on if he dies or something like

43:59.060 --> 44:04.500
that, and he's almost finished all the levels, so it's, you know, props to them for that.

44:05.060 --> 44:09.900
I think it's worth the money for his entertainment, it's not something I would buy for myself,

44:09.900 --> 44:15.940
but kids like it, I guess that's kind of the demographic, so, um, so yeah, and then that's

44:15.940 --> 44:22.180
what I played, and then, um, that was really it, yeah, I bought a 3D printer, I haven't

44:22.180 --> 44:25.380
Did you, that's right, I knew you were gonna get that, you actually bought it, huh?

44:25.380 --> 44:26.540
Yeah, I decided to do it.

44:26.540 --> 44:27.540
That's awesome.

44:27.540 --> 44:28.540
What are you gonna print?

44:28.540 --> 44:29.540
A gun?

44:29.540 --> 44:34.380
If I want to, but no, I'm not gonna print a gun, um, no, actually, there's a lot of

44:34.420 --> 44:38.780
projects, like, that I want to make stuff that, you know, requires, like, 3D printing

44:38.780 --> 44:42.820
or something of the sort, and so I thought it'd be just, you know, kind of fun to be

44:42.820 --> 44:47.940
able to get one of those, so I got a TiVo Tarantula, which is like a Prusa i3 Chinese

44:47.940 --> 44:54.300
knockoff thing, so it's not perfect when I get it, so I have to do a lot of fixes and

44:54.300 --> 44:58.140
mods to it, which will be fun, because I get to learn the process, and there's a lot of

44:58.140 --> 45:03.700
troubleshooting with those, which is not exactly ideal for some people, but I like the challenge

45:03.700 --> 45:10.180
of it, so I'm very curious to see how that's gonna go, um, so yeah, I ordered it, they

45:10.180 --> 45:14.220
haven't shipped it yet, because they have, they drop ship, and so they'll probably ship

45:14.220 --> 45:19.820
it sometime in the next week, so hopefully I should have it probably, uh, probably a

45:19.820 --> 45:22.260
couple weeks, so be able to try it.

45:22.260 --> 45:27.540
Ragenator in chat with the question, what's the TTP on that 3D printer, Loki OLR, and

45:27.540 --> 45:34.140
if you're new to OLR, TTP is timed penis, which is whenever game makers give you something

45:34.140 --> 45:39.540
where you can create, i.e. LittleBigPlanet, i.e. Super Mario Maker, whatever, how long

45:39.540 --> 45:40.940
until somebody does a penis?

45:40.940 --> 45:41.940
It's usually a matter of seconds.

45:41.940 --> 45:46.340
I'm sure that they probably, someone's already, I'm sure someone's already 3D printed a penis,

45:46.340 --> 45:50.920
if whether I'm gonna 3D print a penis, probably not, because prints take like several hours,

45:50.920 --> 45:55.780
that's a lot of dedication and like, money, I mean, I don't see the need to print a 3D

45:55.780 --> 46:06.020
penis for anything, so, I probably, I probably will not print a 3D penis on there, um, but

46:06.020 --> 46:08.860
never say never, so, you know.

46:08.860 --> 46:14.180
Alright, uh, come on, Noel Gust in chat says, print OLR bobbleheads, there you go, that'll

46:14.180 --> 46:18.780
give you something a little, you've got other products, there's something up your sleeve

46:18.780 --> 46:21.020
you're gonna want to print, you bought it for something.

46:21.020 --> 46:24.900
I just bought it because I wanted to buy something, I don't know, it's either that or upgrade

46:24.900 --> 46:29.780
my computer, and upgrading my computer was, uh, more expensive, so I decided, I decided

46:29.780 --> 46:33.460
just to do this, because it was only actually out the door, I think it was only like $2.65,

46:33.460 --> 46:37.980
so, not bad at all, plus it's a kit, I could build it, it's even better.

46:37.980 --> 46:38.980
Fun!

46:38.980 --> 46:39.980
Awesome.

46:39.980 --> 46:42.900
Uh, let's see, my gaming week, so obviously I've been playing a crap ton of Mass Effect

46:42.900 --> 46:46.560
Andromeda, that's really been the game that's dominating my week, which again, despite everything

46:46.560 --> 46:50.660
we talked about in the beginning of the game, I really think there is like, I, I don't,

46:50.660 --> 46:56.060
I don't know how else to explain it, it's like, there's this fantastic, like, core game

46:56.060 --> 46:59.740
that's amazing, and there's all these worlds to see, and then it's like, it's wrapped in

46:59.740 --> 47:00.740
tin foil.

47:00.740 --> 47:05.140
Like, I, I don't, I don't know how else to, to describe it, uh, I, I do think there's

47:05.140 --> 47:09.980
more good than bad in Andromeda, but unfortunately these bad things need to be talked about,

47:09.980 --> 47:14.660
because I think, I, I really do think when people kind of go back at the end of the year,

47:14.660 --> 47:18.540
we're talking about the game of the year, which will undoubtedly be Zelda, I don't,

47:18.540 --> 47:22.580
I mean, unless there's some big holiday surprises at the end of the year.

47:22.580 --> 47:23.580
Reddit Redemption 2?

47:23.580 --> 47:24.580
That's probably 2018.

47:24.580 --> 47:28.460
Well, I, I, I just, I really don't see how Zelda Breath of the Wild isn't like game of

47:28.460 --> 47:33.060
the year at this point, and why, why it's Zelda and not Mass Effect Andromeda.

47:33.060 --> 47:36.660
I just need to give it more time, same with like Final Fantasy 15, man, all these games

47:36.660 --> 47:40.620
are in my backlog now that, like, I was really looking forward to those, and it's kind of

47:40.620 --> 47:45.140
like, eh, when they came out, you know, it's, yeah, I don't know.

47:45.140 --> 47:48.700
But you know, I think we're gonna look back and say, God, they really should have delayed

47:48.700 --> 47:51.380
Mass Effect Andromeda, and it probably could have been game of the year if it came out

47:51.380 --> 47:55.640
during the holiday, but, you know, EA wants to make, you know, be in, be in the black

47:55.640 --> 47:59.020
for their financial year, so they didn't want to delay it again, but we'll see, we'll see

47:59.020 --> 48:01.140
if that costs them.

48:01.140 --> 48:03.180
Anyway, so I did play other games.

48:03.180 --> 48:07.300
I played, of course, I always play Final Fantasy 14, that's always kind of, even if I'm, like,

48:07.300 --> 48:09.980
binging on Mass Effect, like, there just comes a point where I'm like, okay, I can't play

48:09.980 --> 48:13.980
any more Mass Effect tonight, I'm gonna just do something else, because, you know, I just

48:13.980 --> 48:16.660
need to take my mind off Mass Effect for a little bit and do something else, so I'll

48:16.660 --> 48:21.020
play a little bit of Final Fantasy 14, or there's been a couple other games as well.

48:21.020 --> 48:25.100
I didn't talk about this last week, so I need to bring it up now, but Loki, an old favorite

48:25.100 --> 48:31.300
of yours, and mine, came out on the PlayStation 4 a week ago, Clicker Heroes, on the PlayStation

48:31.300 --> 48:35.300
4, believe it or not, which, Yes, I've purposely avoided that.

48:35.300 --> 48:39.140
Look, and if you don't know, So is it, like, button press heroes now?

48:39.140 --> 48:43.180
Yeah, it's basically button press heroes, square, square heroes, because you get square

48:43.180 --> 48:46.100
over and over as the click.

48:46.100 --> 48:49.380
It's the same game, there's not a lot to say about it, it's one of those colossal fucking

48:49.380 --> 48:52.360
time wasters, it's a calculator game, right?

48:52.360 --> 48:56.980
Just like cookie clickers, one plus one equals, equals equals equals equals equals equals

48:56.980 --> 48:59.660
equals equals equals, so you just watch the number grow.

48:59.660 --> 49:02.140
That's what these games end up being, like, that non-stop night we were playing on the

49:02.140 --> 49:06.900
phone for a little bit that Brad from Pop Culture got us into, all those games are calculator

49:06.900 --> 49:11.500
games, and so is Clicker Heroes, except it's on the PlayStation 4, and, do you know how

49:11.500 --> 49:16.620
that fucking game sucked me into, like, come on, one more time, Rob Roberts, come on, I

49:16.620 --> 49:21.580
know, I know we, you played way too much of me on the PC, but come on, Rob, one more time,

49:21.580 --> 49:22.860
you know what got me in?

49:22.860 --> 49:23.860
Trophies.

49:23.860 --> 49:28.840
They fucking put trophies in it, in a free-to-play game, and so, of course, I was like, well,

49:28.840 --> 49:33.980
I mean, I can get that bronze trophy really easy, ascend one time, that doesn't take that

49:33.980 --> 49:34.980
long to do.

49:34.980 --> 49:38.860
So is it all the trophies that they had, like, in the game before, like, but now with actual

49:38.860 --> 49:39.860
trophies?

49:39.860 --> 49:43.220
No, because there was a ton of trophies in the game, like, the little mini-achievements

49:43.220 --> 49:46.860
and stuff, those are all still there, but you only actually get trophies for, like,

49:46.860 --> 49:51.260
maybe ten different things, and there's no platinum, so I think you could probably knock

49:51.260 --> 49:54.660
a few of them out in an hour, but then if you want to get the rest, you're gonna have

49:54.660 --> 49:59.460
to invest some serious stuff, like, one of them is, like, get to zone 3600, which I think

49:59.460 --> 50:07.480
is a gold, but, I mean, it's gonna take a long time to get to zone 3600, so, you know.

50:07.480 --> 50:11.800
But it's a cute little time waster, again, in between sessions of other games, I just,

50:11.800 --> 50:15.520
the one thing I'm gonna complain about that game is that it doesn't work in sleep mode.

50:15.520 --> 50:20.320
If you put it in sleep mode, and then, you know, wake up your PlayStation 4 later, you

50:20.320 --> 50:22.720
don't get any coins from when it was sleeping.

50:22.720 --> 50:24.280
You have to close the game.

50:24.280 --> 50:25.520
Oh, yeah, yeah.

50:25.520 --> 50:28.840
That needs to be fixed, and that's the one complaint I have about it.

50:28.840 --> 50:32.760
I understand why they don't do that, because stuff's not supposed to persist, it's basically,

50:32.760 --> 50:37.440
like, a save state, so you're freezing everything, so I understand that part of it.

50:38.280 --> 50:41.320
Yeah, I mean, I understand why it's happening, but it's stupid, they need to figure out how

50:41.320 --> 50:42.320
to fix that.

50:42.320 --> 50:46.360
Like, save the game right before it sleeps, and then reload it, or do something, I don't

50:46.360 --> 50:47.360
know.

50:47.360 --> 50:48.360
But anyway.

50:48.360 --> 50:54.480
I'm just too, the problem with those games is that I'm too compelled to cheat, and I

50:54.480 --> 50:59.000
will find a way to cheat, whether that means modding a controller to, like, put a timing

50:59.000 --> 51:00.000
switch in there.

51:00.000 --> 51:02.000
Get one of those little woodpecker things.

51:02.000 --> 51:06.960
Auto-fire triggers or something, you know, I will find a way to cheat in that game, and

51:07.000 --> 51:09.000
then it'll be just like, okay, this is stupid.

51:09.000 --> 51:10.000
Yeah.

51:10.000 --> 51:15.560
All right, so there's Clicker Heroes, and then on the Switch this week, I checked out

51:15.560 --> 51:20.280
Splatoon 2 during the test fire, which, over this weekend, I think it's done now, I think,

51:20.280 --> 51:23.320
or the last one might be at 8 o'clock tonight, no, I think it actually wrapped up this morning,

51:23.320 --> 51:27.120
I don't think there are any more play periods, but there were six play periods, I checked

51:27.120 --> 51:32.160
out two of them, and I played a little bit of Splatoon 2, and there really wasn't a lot

51:32.160 --> 51:36.920
to it, because you couldn't customize the characters, you could pick one of four weapons,

51:36.920 --> 51:41.800
you couldn't play with friends, you couldn't really control anything, but again, it was

51:41.800 --> 51:46.400
a free test fire, they really just wanted to test the server capabilities, and for the

51:46.400 --> 51:51.160
most part, for me anyway, it ran fine, like, from the internet does it work perspective,

51:51.160 --> 51:52.160
it was great.

51:52.160 --> 51:54.560
I hope no one bought the system for that beta.

51:54.560 --> 52:00.000
I doubt it, but it's a nice little, like, well, if you bought the system now and you

52:00.000 --> 52:02.960
don't own Zelda, like, what are you doing?

52:02.960 --> 52:05.080
Like, I don't know what else you would have right now.

52:05.080 --> 52:08.400
Much before the movie, they had, like, a big ol' thing about the Switch, where they

52:08.400 --> 52:13.640
show off one, two Switch, that is literally the stupidest thing to show.

52:13.640 --> 52:18.160
That's what they're trying to get the casuals with, is those games, so.

52:18.160 --> 52:21.680
But what happened with getting the casuals with The Legend of Zelda when the first Nintendo

52:21.680 --> 52:22.680
came out?

52:22.680 --> 52:26.720
Fuck that, just playing, like, The Legend of Zelda, it's not casual, it's just, it's

52:26.720 --> 52:28.880
a fucking great game.

52:28.880 --> 52:35.040
So anyway, I enjoyed Splatoon enough, I mean, it was pretty much the same as the first game,

52:35.560 --> 52:40.800
because you can't really peel back all the new layers, because this is just one particular

52:40.800 --> 52:41.800
element of the game.

52:41.800 --> 52:47.360
So again, I can't review Splatoon 2 based off an extremely limited demo of the game,

52:47.360 --> 52:52.840
but I mean, it was that, it was that same game that I got into during Splatoon 1, and

52:52.840 --> 52:56.280
I'm really excited to be able to play this with friends, like, again, the convention

52:56.280 --> 53:00.320
thing is gonna be off the hook, like, I can't wait for that.

53:00.320 --> 53:05.200
I did, okay, and somebody will correct me if I don't say, there is a new weapon, and

53:05.200 --> 53:08.160
some of the new abilities are different, and there are, you know, things like that, but,

53:08.160 --> 53:12.480
I mean, come on, those are incremental upgrades you'd kind of expect with a new Splatoon game,

53:12.480 --> 53:17.360
so there's not a lot I can really say about it besides that, but I had fun that I played,

53:17.360 --> 53:22.000
even though I think I only won, like, one match out of all the ones I played, but a

53:22.000 --> 53:26.020
lot of them, we ended up four versus three, and a lot of them, I don't know if there were

53:26.020 --> 53:30.700
people having connection problems, or just that many people were quitting, but, like,

53:30.700 --> 53:35.360
I don't think I was losing because we were necessarily bad, we were losing because we

53:35.360 --> 53:40.420
kept fucking being under, underrepresented, we only had three people to their four, and

53:40.420 --> 53:44.460
of course you're gonna lose, so Nintendo does, I think, maybe need to figure out, can they

53:44.460 --> 53:49.940
mitigate that problem somehow, can they have a robot that comes in and plays while it tries

53:49.940 --> 53:54.060
to fill the space, like, I don't know, I, anyway.

53:54.100 --> 53:57.980
I was gonna say, Bobby insists that there were no casual gamers when the original Zelda

53:57.980 --> 54:02.620
came out, well, that's not true, there were casual arcade game players, so I would say

54:02.620 --> 54:05.300
that there were casual game players, but.

54:05.300 --> 54:06.300
But not the same way we think about it today.

54:06.300 --> 54:09.700
Not the same way, yeah, exactly, and I think it's stupid to even say someone's a casual

54:09.700 --> 54:14.600
game player, it's just like, can you have a casual movie watcher, I mean, I'm sorry,

54:14.600 --> 54:19.340
you're not, you know, skilled enough to watch this movie, but watch this other movie, it's,

54:19.340 --> 54:23.020
I don't know, it seems like a silly argument.

54:23.020 --> 54:27.140
So I did try to do some of the other weapons besides just the roller, because I like to

54:27.140 --> 54:33.180
play roller in Splatoon, and I can't stand playing Splatoon with motion controls, so

54:33.180 --> 54:36.460
thank God I was able to turn those off, but that turned into a whole debate on Twitter.

54:36.460 --> 54:41.060
I think it's because I play the roller, I don't enjoy motion controls, if I played something

54:41.060 --> 54:45.340
that needed more aim, because I did try to play that new dual weapon thing, and like,

54:45.340 --> 54:48.780
I was really horrible at aiming with it, and I was like, you know what, maybe this is why

54:48.780 --> 54:52.640
you need motion controls, because you can aim so much better with it, but like, when

54:52.640 --> 54:57.000
I play with motion controls, I'm having to hit that reset, the Y button will like, reorient

54:57.000 --> 55:00.240
the camera, I'm hitting that like, repeatedly, but again, with a roller, you don't really

55:00.240 --> 55:04.980
have to aim the same way, I mean, you do for some things, but for the most part, you don't,

55:04.980 --> 55:10.040
so I don't know, I can get away with having motion controls off, but, eh, I don't know.

55:10.040 --> 55:13.880
Still trying to shove it down your throat with the stupid motion controls, it's like

55:13.880 --> 55:16.040
you- I don't know if they're necessarily shoving

55:16.040 --> 55:21.840
it down your throat, then the fact that it does give you like, it's almost like it's

55:21.880 --> 55:26.160
a trackball, like, imagine the motion controls and using the tilt controls is more like using

55:26.160 --> 55:29.840
a trackball, and I mean, you can turn it off if you don't like it lowkey, so I don't think

55:29.840 --> 55:34.680
they're necessarily shoving it down your throat, but it's like, a way to have something more-

55:34.680 --> 55:40.560
because you know, like a mouse, it's the whole keyboard and mouse versus a right analog stick,

55:40.560 --> 55:44.560
which I'm really noticing playing Mass Effect multiplayer, like I played a lot of Mass Effect

55:44.560 --> 55:50.280
multiplayer with 3 on the PC, and now it's like, I have the hardest time aiming on the

55:50.280 --> 55:57.080
two analog nubs on Playstation, like I kind of need a mouse, and so I think the motion

55:57.080 --> 56:00.400
controls is to substitute for the mouse a little bit, even though yes, it's very very

56:00.400 --> 56:04.480
different, it's not- I don't think it's what you think it is, Loki, when you say the forced

56:04.480 --> 56:08.360
motion control thing, because it's just another way to be able to aim, basically.

56:08.360 --> 56:09.880
No, I understand, it's like Zelda.

56:09.880 --> 56:16.120
Yeah. So. Alright. Um, let's see, so that's it, I played a little Splatoon 2, I'm gonna

56:16.120 --> 56:19.680
check out the game when it comes out, I'll get the retail version, just to be able to

56:19.680 --> 56:26.480
play with friends, because I hope, I mean, if it comes out that the matchmaking sucks,

56:26.480 --> 56:30.560
then I might reconsider that, but you know, I guess that's kind of an unknown element

56:30.560 --> 56:34.640
right now, because I would have expected we would have had a hint as to what to expect

56:34.640 --> 56:38.520
with the Nintendo app and all this stuff for the test fire this weekend, but none of that

56:38.520 --> 56:42.320
was there, it was just, it was just, you got thrown in a match with random other people

56:42.320 --> 56:47.960
and that was that. So, I wanna hear a little bit more about how that's all gonna work,

56:48.000 --> 56:53.400
I mean, I would imagine now that's gonna have to be in place for Mario Kart 8, right? Mario

56:53.400 --> 56:59.720
Kart 8's gonna need that. I don't know, we'll see. I don't know, I don't know. Alex P. Carson

56:59.720 --> 57:03.840
in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com says, we're not gonna get into the mouse keyboard

57:03.840 --> 57:08.760
versus controller thing, it'll never end, ain't that the truth? Alright, we're gonna

57:08.760 --> 57:12.400
do at least one or two stories here, and then I gotta get to Dark Soccer and the classic

57:12.400 --> 57:15.520
game of the week, because I said we'd call her at about 7, but oops, we ranted a little

57:15.520 --> 57:18.720
too long in the beginning. So, we'll get to a couple stories here, but I do wanna do

57:18.720 --> 57:23.160
a quick housekeeping. Next week on the show, you don't even know this, Loki, surprise,

57:23.160 --> 57:27.920
Gabe's gonna be back next week to talk about SacIGDA and the Sac Indie Arcade, I'm hoping

57:27.920 --> 57:31.720
Bree's gonna come too, I don't know if they're both coming or just him, but obviously they're

57:31.720 --> 57:35.440
both welcome, and who knows, maybe they'll bring another friend that's involved, but

57:35.440 --> 57:41.840
we're gonna talk about the SacIGDA, Sac Indie Arcade, which is going to happen April 8th,

57:41.840 --> 57:45.000
so it's coming up, it's less than two weeks away. I know, I've been looking forward to

57:45.000 --> 57:49.680
it. So that's coming up, and VOG will be broadcasting all day that Saturday, I'll let you know the

57:49.680 --> 57:53.740
times next week, because I'm not sure exactly when we'll start and when we'll end, but it's

57:53.740 --> 57:57.580
at the same venue we did last time, and so we were able to broadcast AOK, because they

57:57.580 --> 58:02.640
got us a wired, I remember we had to run a wire out a window and down, but we got a wired

58:02.640 --> 58:06.120
connection there, so we were able to do the stream in OK, so I think we're in the exact

58:06.120 --> 58:09.880
same place we were last year, so if you are local in the Sacramento area, check it out,

58:09.880 --> 58:13.840
it's gonna be at the West Sacramento Convention Center on April 8th, so definitely come out

58:13.840 --> 58:16.400
and check that out. That's gonna be a very busy day for me, because I'm hosting Rocky

58:16.400 --> 58:21.800
Horror that night, and you know what's funny? The after-party to the whole thing is at Cafe

58:21.800 --> 58:25.780
Colonial, the venue where the thing was at the first year, right? Now it's the after-party

58:25.780 --> 58:31.240
is there. Well, that's right next door to where we're doing Rocky Horror. So, the producer

58:31.240 --> 58:36.720
already knows, I'm gonna come on stage, tell my jokes, get things started, and then I'm

58:36.720 --> 58:41.960
going next door to hang out while the movie's going, because I've seen the movie a million

58:41.960 --> 58:48.000
times, so anyway, that'll be a fun day, April 8th. OK, let's do some news. Loki, at least

58:48.000 --> 58:50.840
let's get one story here, and then we'll probably get Dark Soccer on the line here.

58:50.840 --> 58:55.760
We can talk a little bit about the evil G, so GameStop is anticipating that there's gonna

58:55.760 --> 59:01.560
be shortage problems this year as well for the Nintendo Switch, and even for the PlayStation

59:01.560 --> 59:06.440
VR, so they're saying that the demand is incredibly strong for this, as soon as we get any in

59:06.440 --> 59:12.320
our stores, it's out within hours. We anticipate we're gonna be chasing supply this entire

59:12.320 --> 59:17.760
year. Of course, Nintendo has insisted that, no, they've got it worked out, but I guess

59:17.760 --> 59:23.840
we'll have to see, and then of course, PlayStation VR. The PS4 levels, they're expecting that

59:23.840 --> 59:29.280
for the Scorpio launch, that it's gonna be, anticipation's higher or equal to the PlayStation

59:29.280 --> 59:34.980
4 levels, so that's gonna be a problem too once that comes out. The other thing, which

59:34.980 --> 59:39.540
is kind of interesting, I guess GameStop's not doing all that well, or at least as well

59:39.540 --> 59:47.420
as they had hoped. They had a week, or holiday sales, so they're anticipating with that,

59:47.420 --> 59:55.180
that they're gonna be closing 150 stores across the US. So yeah, they dropped, the hardware

59:55.180 --> 01:00:03.900
sales dropped about 29%, and software down 19% as well, and I think a lot of that has

01:00:03.900 --> 01:00:07.820
to do with people buying digitally also. That probably has got to at least account

01:00:07.820 --> 01:00:08.820
for some of it.

01:00:08.820 --> 01:00:13.620
Well, it might also be some of the same retail stuff that's, you know what's interesting?

01:00:13.620 --> 01:00:17.300
I think on the show last week, I said something about how Sears and Kmart was gonna be the

01:00:17.300 --> 01:00:21.100
next thing to go away, and then did you know during last week, there was actually a story

01:00:21.100 --> 01:00:26.220
that came out that was like, Sears doesn't know if it actually came out that Sears said,

01:00:26.220 --> 01:00:28.740
we don't know if we're still gonna be here in a few years. They said something along

01:00:28.740 --> 01:00:32.940
those lines that made the investors freak out. So it was just kind of interesting that

01:00:32.940 --> 01:00:37.380
like, wow, I need to keep my mouth shut on OLR sometimes. But anyway, I wonder if some

01:00:37.380 --> 01:00:41.800
of that isn't coming into play too. Just more people are turning to online. Some of it digital,

01:00:41.800 --> 01:00:42.800
some of it Amazon.

01:00:42.800 --> 01:00:46.220
Some of it like Amazon, exactly. Especially when you get this bullshit where you pre-order

01:00:46.220 --> 01:00:51.780
something and you want it, and you can't get it from them because they're out of it. Especially

01:00:51.780 --> 01:00:57.380
now Amazon's doing a lot of that Amazon Now, the Prime Now stuff, where if I wanted a Switch

01:00:57.380 --> 01:01:02.180
and they happen to have it, I could order it and it'd be to my house in a couple hours

01:01:02.180 --> 01:01:09.680
versus having to order it through GameStopper pre-order, whatever the case may be. But also

01:01:09.680 --> 01:01:15.580
I think too, some of that is probably even hardware sales too. Like with the PlayStation

01:01:15.580 --> 01:01:22.820
4 Pro coming out, people anticipating the Switch coming out, PlayStation VR coming out.

01:01:22.820 --> 01:01:26.540
A lot of people probably weren't picking up as many games because they just dropped $400

01:01:26.540 --> 01:01:32.120
on a new system. So that probably plays into it somewhat as well.

01:01:32.120 --> 01:01:36.400
Do you think the GameStop's days are limited? Because I feel like we've seen this coming

01:01:36.400 --> 01:01:37.400
for a while now.

01:01:37.400 --> 01:01:42.280
No, because you've got to have a channel for someone to sell hardware and all the other

01:01:42.280 --> 01:01:47.920
stuff that digitally is just not going to work out. And also sometimes you can get better

01:01:47.920 --> 01:01:53.680
deals there, especially with Nintendo, for example, not dropping the price of their games.

01:01:53.680 --> 01:01:57.360
You may end up finding new stuff. They do have their place and they've also started

01:01:57.360 --> 01:02:01.880
to see the writing on the wall a little bit and they're diversifying a lot more. So you're

01:02:01.880 --> 01:02:08.620
seeing them get into more of like the toys and like hobby stuff, toys and apparel stuff.

01:02:08.620 --> 01:02:13.280
So they are aware that they need to have more higher margin. That's the whole reasons they're

01:02:13.280 --> 01:02:19.160
getting in higher margin items that are going to offset the drop in sales a little bit.

01:02:19.160 --> 01:02:23.800
But they're always going to have, for one, they're still the biggest player in this.

01:02:23.800 --> 01:02:28.240
And they're of course going to make sure that they're going to stay the biggest player by,

01:02:28.240 --> 01:02:33.280
they have good control over these publishers. They fucking listen to when GameStop wants

01:02:33.280 --> 01:02:37.280
them to do something. So until we get to that point where the publisher is like, well, we

01:02:37.280 --> 01:02:40.440
don't need you anymore, but they do. So that's not going to ever happen.

01:02:40.440 --> 01:02:45.380
Plus I imagine the used thing still does very well for GameStop because nobody else really

01:02:45.380 --> 01:02:49.720
gets into that the same way, right? I mean, like I know others have tried. I know Best

01:02:49.720 --> 01:02:53.840
Buy has tried. Amazon has a thing, but you know, when you think of buying used games,

01:02:53.840 --> 01:02:57.960
you don't really think of Amazon, to be honest. Like I don't, can you even get used games?

01:02:57.960 --> 01:02:59.680
I know you can trade them in, but what happens to them?

01:02:59.680 --> 01:03:04.240
You can buy used games from Amazon. See, I just, I, I think people think more

01:03:04.240 --> 01:03:08.520
about GameStop. I think GameStop still has done well in, in controlling that conversation

01:03:08.520 --> 01:03:14.320
for better or for worse. The GameStop's credit, you with used games,

01:03:14.320 --> 01:03:18.440
you kind of know what you're getting from when you go there. Like you, when you're buying

01:03:18.440 --> 01:03:22.660
something on eBay or Amazon or something like that, you're not entirely sure what the quality

01:03:22.660 --> 01:03:26.500
is going to be. I mean, they may have pictures and stuff, but at least with like GameStop,

01:03:26.500 --> 01:03:30.420
you see the disc right in front of you. You can tell, okay, this looks like shit or, you

01:03:30.420 --> 01:03:35.420
know, this is a bad condition. I mean, you kind of have that. Plus they have the quick,

01:03:35.420 --> 01:03:39.260
you know, seven day warranty thing on it. So like if it does end up not working, I've

01:03:39.260 --> 01:03:44.420
had that happen. You just take it right back and exchange it out without the hassle. So

01:03:44.420 --> 01:03:47.180
I think it's a little bit more convenient in that sense, but yeah, I mean, there's other

01:03:47.180 --> 01:03:50.740
places you're going to be able to find deals all over the place.

01:03:50.740 --> 01:03:53.820
Now Bobby Black Wolf is pointing out in her chat room over at live.vognetwork.com that

01:03:53.820 --> 01:03:58.300
Walmart is the biggest player and the evil G doesn't come close when it comes to, you

01:03:58.300 --> 01:04:01.460
know, who's selling the games. I could, I could definitely see that, you know, depends

01:04:01.460 --> 01:04:04.980
on your part of the country. See living here in California, we probably don't think of

01:04:04.980 --> 01:04:09.080
that as much, even though Walmart's a big player here, it's probably something that's

01:04:09.080 --> 01:04:10.580
much more apparent in other parts of the country.

01:04:10.580 --> 01:04:14.540
They're a big retail player, but I think game wise, I think that they're doing more business

01:04:14.540 --> 01:04:16.540
through GameStop. Really?

01:04:16.540 --> 01:04:20.180
At least there was when I was working in the distribution business.

01:04:20.180 --> 01:04:24.740
I was like, you got any receipts to back that up? Cause that's, even I'm having a hard time

01:04:24.740 --> 01:04:25.740
doing that.

01:04:25.740 --> 01:04:29.460
I can only, I can only go by what, what the reps said at the time. So then again, that

01:04:29.460 --> 01:04:31.500
was three years ago. So who knows?

01:04:31.500 --> 01:04:36.020
What is it? I will say this. It is, it is interesting. I would also believe that Walmart

01:04:36.020 --> 01:04:38.940
is probably a bigger player than GameStop at the end of the day for what it's worth.

01:04:38.940 --> 01:04:43.540
But it is interesting to me that most of the GameStops around here, if they're not in the

01:04:43.540 --> 01:04:45.180
mall or in a Walmart parking lot.

01:04:45.420 --> 01:04:46.420
Well, isn't that weird?

01:04:46.420 --> 01:04:50.260
It is weird. Yeah. But the other thing too, let me look at like, if you want to talk about

01:04:50.260 --> 01:04:54.460
who's the big players, I mean, look at, you know, who's getting exclusive DLC. It was

01:04:54.460 --> 01:05:00.100
Walmart getting exclusive DLC or GameStop getting exclusive DLC. I mean, so that

01:05:00.100 --> 01:05:03.420
Walmart gets a thing here and there, but okay. GameStop does get more.

01:05:03.420 --> 01:05:07.340
They get quite a bit more and it's because they do a lot more marketing push for these

01:05:07.340 --> 01:05:12.060
games as well. And a lot of people, I mean, they, people will go to Walmart, but they're

01:05:12.060 --> 01:05:16.500
not going to necessarily, I don't think too many people are pre-ordering physically through

01:05:16.500 --> 01:05:20.860
Walmart. Some people will. I mean, it usually, if they say that Walmart still does midnight

01:05:20.860 --> 01:05:24.380
sales and stuff and does, I mean, so does Target. So does, you know, it just depends.

01:05:24.380 --> 01:05:29.860
I think people now are starting to not necessarily rely as heavily on GameStop. They realize

01:05:29.860 --> 01:05:36.180
that like, Oh, internet, I can, I can shop around now and it's a lot easier to shop around.

01:05:36.180 --> 01:05:38.180
I think that's kind of what's hurting them more.

01:05:38.300 --> 01:05:43.460
Well, Walmart certainly killed music stores and that, I mean, piracy really killed music

01:05:43.460 --> 01:05:49.260
stores, but Walmart also had a huge hand in that too. So it's, it's interesting that GameStop

01:05:49.260 --> 01:05:55.820
has persevered where a place like Tower Records or The Warehouse or whatever, you know,

01:05:55.820 --> 01:06:02.260
music stores you can think of did not. So anyway, I do want to make sure we get to Dark

01:06:02.260 --> 01:06:06.580
Sakura because she's patiently awaiting our call. So we're going to get her on the line

01:06:06.620 --> 01:06:10.140
here and you can give us a call a little later in the show, but we're going to give Dark

01:06:10.140 --> 01:06:13.940
Sakura's telephone a ring right now and get her on the show to check in with her. Cause

01:06:13.940 --> 01:06:17.940
I know y'all are dying to hear her thoughts on Mass Effect Andromeda, as well as get into

01:06:17.940 --> 01:06:22.420
the classic game of the week for tonight. And I'm hoping that she's near her phone cause

01:06:22.420 --> 01:06:26.940
I'm about to get her voicemail. Even though I just checked in with her. All right, that

01:06:26.940 --> 01:06:33.500
is bad. Cause she's not standing by your phone. Live radio. What can you do? Loki, you got

01:06:33.500 --> 01:06:37.180
something short you can help fill time with here? Yeah, we can talk about the new classic

01:06:37.180 --> 01:06:43.940
game of the week Halo. You bet that that's going to be your ass next week. So Nintendo

01:06:43.940 --> 01:06:50.860
or I should say Reggie is promising that Nintendo is going to have a big E3 this year. And of

01:06:50.860 --> 01:06:56.980
course his PR spin. E3 is always a big time for Nintendo. We look at each E3 as a unique

01:06:56.980 --> 01:07:01.140
opportunity to tell our story. We're going to have a big E3 this year. We're showcasing

01:07:01.140 --> 01:07:06.500
a variety of games, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, and some secrets

01:07:06.500 --> 01:07:15.300
and 3DS. Yeah. This was an interview they had with Fox News. Are they going to do a

01:07:15.300 --> 01:07:20.980
press conference thingy again? Probably. They're, they're not going to be, um, I don't think

01:07:20.980 --> 01:07:25.300
they're actually, well, I mean, they didn't really say they're going to have a press conference,

01:07:25.300 --> 01:07:31.300
but I think they're probably going to do the directs. So, I don't know. I know E3 or

01:07:31.300 --> 01:07:35.980
EA is not going to be at E3 again. They're going to be doing their little, like we're,

01:07:35.980 --> 01:07:39.860
we're doing E3, but at the same time as E3, but not really at E3. Oh, is that what they're

01:07:39.860 --> 01:07:44.620
playing this year? That's what they're doing. Um, as I alluded to earlier in the show, when

01:07:44.620 --> 01:07:49.300
I made fun of Mass Effect Andromeda, I was saying that this was actually coming from

01:07:49.300 --> 01:07:54.740
Nintendo. So there's been some issue with Joy-Cons and they're having some issues, not

01:07:54.740 --> 01:08:00.780
syncing or disconnecting because of some manufacturing variations, as Nintendo puts

01:08:00.780 --> 01:08:08.080
it. So people have found, um, you know, that when they've come back being fixed from Nintendo,

01:08:08.080 --> 01:08:12.420
that now they're adding this like piece of conductive foam in there that's supposed to

01:08:12.420 --> 01:08:17.340
help with the signal or something like that. But yeah, they said there's no issue or no

01:08:17.340 --> 01:08:23.300
design issue with the Joy-Con controllers and no widespread, um, proactive repair or

01:08:23.300 --> 01:08:29.060
replacement effort is underway. And manufacturing variation has resulted in wireless interference

01:08:29.060 --> 01:08:34.860
with a small number of left Joy-Cons. Moving forward, this will not be an issue as manufacturing

01:08:34.860 --> 01:08:38.580
variation has been addressed.

01:08:38.580 --> 01:08:43.100
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com,

01:08:43.100 --> 01:08:46.220
use the passphrase, black.

01:08:46.220 --> 01:08:49.180
Let me, uh, I hate to do this. I got to do it. There's no other way I can do this to

01:08:49.180 --> 01:08:53.620
do this live. She's saying it's not ringing for her, um, for some reason. So I'm just

01:08:53.620 --> 01:08:56.060
making sure that our phone is actually working. So what I'm doing right now is I'm actually

01:08:56.060 --> 01:09:01.900
calling my own cell phone here, live on air. Okay. It's ringing. So I know I can call out.

01:09:01.900 --> 01:09:05.600
So we're going to, we're going to try to do this again. That was my cell phone. So let's

01:09:05.600 --> 01:09:10.180
try this one more time with Dark Sakura. Maybe she was trying to call us as we were calling

01:09:10.180 --> 01:09:16.260
her, but we're going to see if it rings now. It's not even okay. There it is. What are

01:09:16.260 --> 01:09:21.540
you eating? And I think, hello, hi, dark soccer. There you are. It rained this time.

01:09:21.540 --> 01:09:25.340
There you go. Yeah, it's weird. We're having phone problems, but, uh, hooray. You're here.

01:09:25.340 --> 01:09:32.940
How are you? How are you feeling? Um, I hurt, but I'm okay. Usually hanging in there. Yeah,

01:09:32.940 --> 01:09:39.160
I, uh, I don't recommend to anybody to get kidney stones. Just don't do it. I'm not sure

01:09:39.160 --> 01:09:43.260
it's something that'll just sound device in your house. I don't think, uh, you, you really

01:09:43.260 --> 01:09:49.080
get a choice in the matter usually. Well, yeah, that's true, but it's the worst pain

01:09:49.080 --> 01:09:55.440
I've ever felt in my life. Well, feel better. I hope, uh, I hope everything passes with

01:09:55.440 --> 01:10:03.960
minimal pain. Um, so, uh, at the top of the show. Okay. So we spent like 45 minutes talking

01:10:03.960 --> 01:10:07.380
about mass effect and drama tonight. And by the way, dark soccer, I hope you can hear

01:10:07.380 --> 01:10:10.580
the show at some point. I think it'd be very proud of Loki tonight. Some of the things

01:10:10.580 --> 01:10:14.820
he said, but anyway, I'll leave it at that. But the, uh, our listenership is dying to

01:10:14.820 --> 01:10:19.240
know what are your thoughts early on with mass effect Andromeda? I'm pretty happy with

01:10:19.240 --> 01:10:25.700
it actually. Although the character creation is derp, tastic, and I'm waiting for the modders

01:10:25.700 --> 01:10:33.640
to step up their game. Um, for the most part, I really enjoyed all the characters. Um, there

01:10:33.640 --> 01:10:39.640
just been certain things that I've rolled my eyes at just, you know, in game stuff that

01:10:40.080 --> 01:10:44.940
one would know as a person living in their universe. I'm like, well, this isn't revisionist

01:10:44.940 --> 01:10:51.940
history. Um, I, I was kind of thinking of going after the Turian lady, but I don't know.

01:10:51.940 --> 01:10:57.940
She's a little bit more bestie and, you know, I don't want to do like a Garrett's replacement.

01:10:57.940 --> 01:11:03.540
So, uh, it's, but she's been cool. She's been like her and Drack are my favorite characters

01:11:03.540 --> 01:11:09.180
so far. So I like the Turian and the Krogan. All right. Good, good. What about one thing

01:11:09.180 --> 01:11:12.320
we spent a lot of time talking about where some of the bugs that are going on with the

01:11:12.320 --> 01:11:16.160
game, are you, are you encountering, are you encountering bugs? Is it, I mean, you mentioned

01:11:16.160 --> 01:11:19.360
the character creators kind of derpy, but are you, are you running into bugs that are

01:11:19.360 --> 01:11:26.360
ruining it for you? I actually had to adjust my, um, my, uh, graphic settings a few times,

01:11:27.120 --> 01:11:31.440
um, because it would like freeze in certain parts of the dialogue and then the mouse would

01:11:31.440 --> 01:11:38.440
keep moving. So I was getting that issue happening, um, and a little bit of jerkiness. Weird.

01:11:38.860 --> 01:11:45.140
But um, you know, and there, there actually were a few, um, I wouldn't call it a bug,

01:11:45.140 --> 01:11:51.740
but it's just a weird animation issue as like if you go up to talk to a character and you

01:11:51.740 --> 01:11:55.780
approach them at just the wrong angle, of course the camera tries to move over your

01:11:55.780 --> 01:12:00.620
shoulder and then you just got the character there continuing whatever animation they were

01:12:00.620 --> 01:12:05.460
doing beforehand, you know, or whatever cycle of animation, instead of having them just

01:12:05.480 --> 01:12:12.480
turn and talk to you. So it's like, I'm talking to you, but I'm also scanning this thing and

01:12:12.480 --> 01:12:17.920
doing an interpretive dance. Yeah. So there's, that's sort of how it came out. There's some

01:12:17.920 --> 01:12:21.480
weird things that maybe if it, maybe if they'd waited just a little longer to release the

01:12:21.480 --> 01:12:24.800
game, they could have, um, worked out, but then we would have had to wait longer to play

01:12:24.800 --> 01:12:29.160
the game. So I don't know. I would have been fine with that. Yeah. All right. That's, that's

01:12:29.160 --> 01:12:33.440
fair. I think, uh, and a lot of people in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com

01:12:33.440 --> 01:12:37.780
have been invoking the good old Miyamoto quote in our chat room about how a bad game

01:12:37.780 --> 01:12:43.340
is bad forever, but a good game. Nobody remembers that it gets delayed. Just like Zelda people,

01:12:43.340 --> 01:12:48.260
you know, that game was supposed to be out. I think originally it was like a holiday 2015

01:12:48.260 --> 01:12:52.620
game, wasn't it? And then they pushed it back several times. Yeah. To make it, to make it

01:12:52.620 --> 01:12:57.500
happen. But now nobody cares cause Zelda's awesome. Well, we've seen both of the endings

01:12:57.500 --> 01:13:02.900
for that now. Yeah. It was good. Yeah, it was pretty good. I mean, you've got to get

01:13:02.900 --> 01:13:07.800
all of the memories and a few other things to get like the true ending. But one thing

01:13:07.800 --> 01:13:12.000
that disappointed me about that is that I was kind of under the impression that after

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:17.240
you beat the games and you've got more game, you know, like, like post end game stuff.

01:13:17.240 --> 01:13:21.860
Um, and instead it doesn't quite work out that way, which I would have liked to have

01:13:21.860 --> 01:13:27.680
like the whole post game rebuilding Hyrule thing, but it's not meant to be. Maybe that's

01:13:27.680 --> 01:13:33.120
the DLC. We'll see. Maybe. See, that was, it was the whole existence of DLC is what

01:13:33.120 --> 01:13:38.700
made me think that might be it, but oh well. All right. Well, we're going to, we're going

01:13:38.700 --> 01:13:44.700
to go back to a more classic time when there wasn't any DLC. You know what? The game came

01:13:44.700 --> 01:13:49.860
out and it is what it is. Either you like it or you don't. It's the classic game. And

01:13:49.860 --> 01:13:56.360
then you had to go stand in line to do a return and then find your receipt. Uh, dark soccer

01:13:56.420 --> 01:14:00.140
is going to jump into the gaming vault and find a game that she thinks, Hey, you guys

01:14:00.140 --> 01:14:05.480
should be playing this game this week. If you don't, you are ignorant and you've picked.

01:14:05.480 --> 01:14:09.360
I, this is one of those games this week where I'm like, this is a 10 year old game. Yes,

01:14:09.360 --> 01:14:14.720
of course it is. Oh my gosh. I can't believe this qualifies 11 year old game. All right.

01:14:14.720 --> 01:14:18.040
Dark soccer. What is the classic? And it is a classic. What is the classic game of the

01:14:18.040 --> 01:14:25.040
week? Cooking mama. I decided to pick cooking mama and part of this, I am actually going

01:14:26.400 --> 01:14:32.840
to say thank you to Game Tim who I found on YouTube who does the cooking with cooking

01:14:32.840 --> 01:14:39.840
mama and we have chatted a little bit back and forth on Twitter and I would like to welcome

01:14:40.480 --> 01:14:45.520
them as a listener to the show. So thank you for listening to us. Um, love to have them

01:14:45.520 --> 01:14:50.660
on the show, but going back into the game, uh, it is cooking mama, which came out in

01:14:50.660 --> 01:14:57.660
Japan on March 23rd, 2006 and in North America, September 12th, 2006. Sorry, my voice is still

01:14:59.420 --> 01:15:04.900
a little icky today. Um, it was published by Taiko, um, in Japan, in the U S it was

01:15:04.900 --> 01:15:11.900
by Majesco and, and how regions five Oh five games. It was awarded IDN's best of E3 award

01:15:13.420 --> 01:15:20.420
for 2006. You want to know what's funny? We were at 2006, um, E3. We were, that was the

01:15:21.100 --> 01:15:26.700
Paris Hilton year. Oh yeah, that's, that's brilliant. We started on that and we call,

01:15:26.700 --> 01:15:32.820
we call it that because we had to walk a completely different direction because Paris Hilton was

01:15:32.820 --> 01:15:37.580
at the booth and heaven forbid we get too close to a celebrity we don't give a fuck

01:15:37.580 --> 01:15:43.060
about and it was like, Hey, I did meet John Cena and that was cool. We were walking like

01:15:43.060 --> 01:15:47.260
behind and it wasn't like it was like we were walking behind a wall where she might've been

01:15:47.260 --> 01:15:50.380
on the other side. It was so frustrating, but it was also more people are remembered

01:15:50.420 --> 01:15:55.420
as the year that we was unveiled the last big year before the airport years. But anyway,

01:15:55.420 --> 01:16:02.420
yes. Well anyway, in cooking mama as one might guess it has to do with cooking. Basically

01:16:02.660 --> 01:16:08.860
follow the instructions that mama gives you. Um, you use your stylus on the 3DS to do different

01:16:08.860 --> 01:16:15.300
tasks. Like you could chop the vegetables and slice meat or flip food or even down to

01:16:15.340 --> 01:16:21.340
your plating of your food. So that's, I mean, I thought that didn't touch as well, but you've

01:16:21.340 --> 01:16:27.740
also have kind of mundane tasks like pouring the water and things like that. And it's got

01:16:27.740 --> 01:16:34.740
different recipes that you can make as well. Um, in fact, some of the mechanics and the

01:16:35.060 --> 01:16:39.580
little mini games kind of make me think of how music games go, like where they have you

01:16:39.580 --> 01:16:46.580
do things a certain way or cut across a certain way, kind of like, um, um, you know, where

01:16:49.580 --> 01:16:56.580
it moves across the screen a certain way. So it's got kind of that in there too, but

01:16:56.580 --> 01:17:03.580
now you can, with the 3DS, you actually have to use the first part of the screen to show

01:17:04.340 --> 01:17:10.260
you your instructions for doing what you have to do on the bottom screen. So if you screw

01:17:10.260 --> 01:17:17.060
up or if the time expires without making enough progress, then it's considered a failure.

01:17:17.060 --> 01:17:22.980
And then you get mama pissed off with the caption that says, don't worry, mama will

01:17:22.980 --> 01:17:29.980
fix it. And basically as you perform each of the tasks in the mini games, your performance

01:17:30.700 --> 01:17:37.700
is rated by the time you get to the end of that level. And you can make all kinds of

01:17:37.700 --> 01:17:42.700
interesting dishes in the game. Now, the let's cook part, honestly, I think I like the food

01:17:42.700 --> 01:17:49.700
prep part better than the let's cook part just because, um, the cooking part is, it

01:17:50.700 --> 01:17:54.700
seems a little subjective and it doesn't always make sense to me. Like, turn it down, turn

01:17:54.700 --> 01:17:57.700
it up, turn it down, turn it up. Like, make up your mind. You're supposed to do it all

01:17:58.700 --> 01:18:05.700
at certain times anyway. And like, some of the ingredients are kind of bizarre to me,

01:18:06.700 --> 01:18:12.700
but hey, it is what it is. Like, I don't put cucumbers on a sandwich. Um, and then you

01:18:12.700 --> 01:18:18.700
can, um, you know, basically it's just all these different modes in that you combine

01:18:18.700 --> 01:18:23.700
things, you cook things, you chop things, like bring skills like peeling and stewing

01:18:23.700 --> 01:18:29.700
and all of that. And some of the dishes in the game, honestly enough, are really pretty

01:18:29.700 --> 01:18:36.700
good. Um, I may or may not have used a couple of inspirations in the past, although I'll

01:18:37.700 --> 01:18:44.700
be honest, I've gone back and looked up other recipes myself. So, um, Cooking Mama was actually

01:18:44.700 --> 01:18:51.700
considered kind of average, um, when it released. Um, Famitsu gave it a 28 out of 40. Um, it

01:18:52.700 --> 01:18:58.700
was, though, considered to be a great title for being a budget title. Um, it was $20 at

01:18:58.700 --> 01:19:05.700
release, it was pretty inexpensive and a very solid and replayable game. Um, and it really

01:19:06.700 --> 01:19:11.700
is something that you can sit down and play casually. Like, you can do a few recipes here

01:19:11.700 --> 01:19:17.700
and then save it, and then do a few recipes other and save it. So, um, the first game

01:19:17.700 --> 01:19:23.700
Cooking Mama made, uh, they actually sold over 500,000 copies in the US, and, um, that's

01:19:24.700 --> 01:19:31.700
as of August 15th, 2007, and over a million in the TAO regions. So, um, and believe it

01:19:32.700 --> 01:19:36.700
or not, Miley Cyrus was a big fan of the series. She came in like a Cooking Mama.

01:19:37.700 --> 01:19:38.700
That's so random.

01:19:39.700 --> 01:19:43.700
Now, here's the fun thing. You remember, cause we even made fun of this on the show, when

01:19:44.700 --> 01:19:45.700
PETA had their, their panties in a bunch over it.

01:19:45.700 --> 01:19:46.700
Yes, I do remember that.

01:19:47.700 --> 01:19:54.700
It was Cooking Mama, Mama kills animals. And so, the press release response was hilarious.

01:19:55.700 --> 01:20:01.700
It's Mama saying, I would never put rat in my ratatouille, and pointed out the vegetarian

01:20:02.700 --> 01:20:07.700
recipes. And then PETA kinda got their panties unplifted when Gardening Mama came out.

01:20:08.700 --> 01:20:10.700
So, I know, right?

01:20:11.700 --> 01:20:12.700
It's funny.

01:20:12.700 --> 01:20:19.700
So, there, there were sequels. Um, one of, um, one of them was Cooking Mama Cook-Off.

01:20:20.700 --> 01:20:24.700
It came out, um, for the Wii, and it used the Wiimote for the cooking, kinda like how

01:20:25.700 --> 01:20:28.700
the, uh, the surgery, the surgery game, by the way, stopped using the Wiimote, I'm just

01:20:29.700 --> 01:20:34.700
saying. And then we got another DS game, which is Cooking Mama to Dinner with Friends.

01:20:35.700 --> 01:20:40.700
And it has, like, different mini-games and other modes. On top of that, it has Mama speaking

01:20:40.700 --> 01:20:46.700
with a very, very thick accent. So, um, there's also Cooking Mama World Kitchen for Wii.

01:20:47.700 --> 01:20:53.700
Um, and then there is another DS sequel, Cooking Mama 3 Stop and Chop, um, that came out, um,

01:20:54.700 --> 01:20:59.700
in October 2009. Uh, Mama has been in other games too, like Babysitting Mama. Did you see

01:21:00.700 --> 01:21:01.700
that baby thing that comes with it? It's creepy.

01:21:02.700 --> 01:21:03.700
Yeah, it's super creepy.

01:21:04.700 --> 01:21:06.700
And then Crafty Mama, Gardening Mama.

01:21:07.700 --> 01:21:09.700
Where she teaches you, she teaches you how to cook crack.

01:21:10.700 --> 01:21:17.700
And then Gardening Mama 2, Forest Friends. There is also Cooking Mama 4, Kitchen Magic

01:21:18.700 --> 01:21:24.700
for the 3DS, and Cooking Mama 5, Bon Appetit. And there's also kind of a pseudo-sequel called

01:21:25.700 --> 01:21:32.700
Cooking Mama Sweet Shop that was on the 3DS as well. Um, now, what I would like to stop

01:21:33.700 --> 01:21:40.700
and reference for a moment is that it, believe it or not, it kind of has gameplay items in

01:21:41.700 --> 01:21:48.700
common with a Super Nintendo era game. And that game was called, um, Multiple-Chan No

01:21:50.700 --> 01:21:55.700
Wonder Kitchen. And I had to bring this up because I actually have played a little bit

01:21:56.700 --> 01:22:01.700
of this game. I had it on an emulator way back in the day and I was like, eh, it's cute.

01:22:02.700 --> 01:22:07.700
Basically, Multiple-Chan No Wonder Kitchen, um, was one of those advertising games, you

01:22:08.700 --> 01:22:15.700
know, like how Joki Doki Panic was and all that. It was sponsored by, um, Aji no Moto,

01:22:16.700 --> 01:22:22.700
um, the company that does, like, they sell, like, MSD additive and, and like some brands

01:22:23.700 --> 01:22:28.700
of dashi. They're basically kitchen, uh, condiments. And this game came out in 1993 for the

01:22:28.700 --> 01:22:34.700
Super Famicom. It was cut in, uh, sorry, point and click. And you even got, like, seals

01:22:35.700 --> 01:22:40.700
for their brand of mayonnaise or something to get the game. Um, but the cooking aspect

01:22:41.700 --> 01:22:46.700
of the game, the meal preparation is more than a little bit similar to Cooking Mama

01:22:47.700 --> 01:22:51.700
and it makes me think that that was where the idea for Cooking Mama came from, if that

01:22:52.700 --> 01:22:57.700
makes sense. Yeah. Now, I'm trying to find some of the Cooking Mama recipes so I can

01:22:58.700 --> 01:23:04.700
tell you what's in there because it actually, it's fairly international. Um, I, I will say

01:23:05.700 --> 01:23:12.700
from all of the, um, uh, watching Cooking with Dog and, uh, you know, just my own hunt

01:23:13.700 --> 01:23:23.700
down of recipes and what I know about Japanese cooking is that, um, it, um, really is very

01:23:23.700 --> 01:23:29.700
still, I'd say, Japanese oriented for the style of cooking and ingredients. Um, but

01:23:30.700 --> 01:23:34.700
I was trying, hopefully trying to find some of the, the recipes in it. Like, I know that

01:23:35.700 --> 01:23:43.700
you can do Salisbury steak or potato salad or, um, pizza. Um, and then of course there's,

01:23:44.700 --> 01:23:50.700
uh, okonomiyaki I think was one. You can do instant ramen. But, but the best part, the

01:23:50.700 --> 01:23:56.700
best part Dark Saga is when you fuck up the food, what happens? Mama has to fix it. Don't

01:23:57.700 --> 01:24:03.700
worry, Mama will fix it. Exactly right. Ok, so here's, here's some of the other episodes

01:24:04.700 --> 01:24:08.700
in here. So you can do, um, ogakodon in there, which is like one of my favorite ever Japanese

01:24:09.700 --> 01:24:15.700
dishes. Although it calls it chicken and egg rice bowl. You have, uh, chicken and tomato

01:24:15.700 --> 01:24:22.700
sauce. You have wontons, you have soba, uh, agidashi doku is in it. You get a US one.

01:24:23.700 --> 01:24:27.700
So there's all kinds of stuff. It's really great. And yeah, but, but can Mama fix my

01:24:28.700 --> 01:24:34.700
life? Cause it's pretty broken. I don't think your life is broken. Tiny Mama. You did even

01:24:35.700 --> 01:24:42.700
better than Mama. That's very sweet of you to say. It doesn't affect it when. Alright.

01:24:43.700 --> 01:24:48.700
You give me Mama to fix America. Anything else to say about Cookie Mama, the game of

01:24:49.700 --> 01:24:54.700
the week? I am super hungry and I'm actually going to be making something tonight in my

01:24:55.700 --> 01:24:59.700
kitchen. There, oh, well, and if you fuck it up, don't worry, Dan will have to clean

01:25:00.700 --> 01:25:07.700
it up. Dan will fix it. No, I'm a good cook. I'm making, um, uh, nut bread. Mmm, yummy.

01:25:07.700 --> 01:25:11.700
We'll save some for next week. We have guests here in studio next week, so save some. We'll

01:25:12.700 --> 01:25:16.700
see about, we'll see about that. Alright. Alright, well, uh, Dark Saga is joining us

01:25:17.700 --> 01:25:21.700
and that was the classic game of the week, Cooking Mama, um, available on the 3DS, which

01:25:22.700 --> 01:25:25.700
I'm sure a lot of you guys have played. If you haven't, you should go check it out and

01:25:26.700 --> 01:25:30.700
don't worry if you fuck it up, Mama will fix it. One last little thing that I think is

01:25:31.700 --> 01:25:35.700
worth mentioning. You know that, um, uh, ragtime piano player whose site reads video game

01:25:35.700 --> 01:25:41.700
music? Yeah. There's one of him doing the Cooking Mama theme. Oh, that's funny. Yeah,

01:25:42.700 --> 01:25:44.700
cause you can kind of hear that in the background. It's really cool. It's like a ragtime piano

01:25:45.700 --> 01:25:50.700
theme that plays during the whole game. Exactly, so it's, it's, and once he starts doing improvisation

01:25:51.700 --> 01:25:55.700
it's amazing, but I think that's worth a listen as well. Very cool. Alright, well, Dark

01:25:56.700 --> 01:25:58.700
Saga, I'm going to let you go so we can get to break, but, uh, feel better, okay, and

01:25:59.700 --> 01:26:03.700
then, uh, have fun cooking tonight. Thank you, have fun breaking things. We will, bye.

01:26:03.700 --> 01:26:07.700
Alright, we're going to go ahead and take a break. Uh, when we come back though, with

01:26:08.700 --> 01:26:11.700
more of Orange Lounge Radio, lots more news because we barely scratched the surface on

01:26:12.700 --> 01:26:14.700
news, right? So we have a lot more news to come up. Yes. When we come back to the show

01:26:15.700 --> 01:26:19.700
and of course your calls as well, uh, over Orange Lounge Radio on Skype and we will get

01:26:20.700 --> 01:26:22.700
to the mailbag as well. I know we have at least one email we got to get to tonight.

01:26:23.700 --> 01:26:25.700
There might've been more too, so we'll get to all that when we come back after this break

01:26:26.700 --> 01:26:27.700
with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:26:27.700 --> 01:26:39.700
And welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio. Live tonight, episode number 681 for

01:26:40.700 --> 01:26:46.700
March 26th of 2017. If you're just joining us over at VOG Network, you missed a fun little

01:26:47.700 --> 01:26:50.700
spirited discussion about Mass Effect Andromeda at the beginning of the show and talking

01:26:51.700 --> 01:26:54.700
about some other games from this week. Talking a little bit about Nintendo needing to amp

01:26:54.700 --> 01:26:58.700
up supplies to the Switch and some of the things the GameStop's going through this week.

01:26:59.700 --> 01:27:03.700
But we've got some more news to come, right, Loki? Yes we do. So we can talk a little bit

01:27:04.700 --> 01:27:08.700
about rumors because everybody loves rumors. Yay! Rumor has it. And these are all, these

01:27:09.700 --> 01:27:13.700
are all Activision rumors. Oh boy. So, uh, the first one, which actually I believe did

01:27:14.700 --> 01:27:17.700
get confirmed, was that Destiny 2 was supposed to be out in September. When we say got

01:27:18.700 --> 01:27:21.700
confirmed, like Activision said? I want to say I saw on Twitter there was someone that

01:27:21.700 --> 01:27:27.700
was in the know, I can't remember who it was, this was a while ago, I saw this on,

01:27:28.700 --> 01:27:32.700
someone saw, it was a poster that got leaked out there, and then there was someone that

01:27:33.700 --> 01:27:42.700
did confirm. Way to ruin E3. There was going to be an announcement. So, yeah, interesting.

01:27:43.700 --> 01:27:48.700
So Destiny 2, that'll be something we can hopefully expect this year. So in September.

01:27:48.700 --> 01:27:52.700
In September. Cool. And this is according to a poster. And that's the whole, we knew

01:27:53.700 --> 01:27:55.700
it was coming because they had that whole discussion about that you can't transfer your

01:27:56.700 --> 01:27:59.700
characters, anything besides like cosmetic stuff. And we knew it was coming this year

01:28:00.700 --> 01:28:03.700
because they did announce that it was coming in the fall. Yeah. So, I mean, it makes sense

01:28:04.700 --> 01:28:10.700
because Destiny 1 came out in September, so, sure. But that was, god, almost three, four

01:28:11.700 --> 01:28:14.700
years ago at this point, right? Has it been that long? It has been a little while. It's

01:28:14.700 --> 01:28:18.700
been over a year, probably three years ago. Probably three years ago. The other rumor

01:28:19.700 --> 01:28:26.700
is another also promotional piece, and this is a promotional poster or something for Call

01:28:27.700 --> 01:28:34.700
of Duty World War II. So kind of saying that this would take Call of Duty back to its roots,

01:28:35.700 --> 01:28:41.700
so kind of pulling a fucking, you know, EA and Battlefield 1, you know, now let's take

01:28:41.700 --> 01:28:46.700
it back because our modern or future warfare shit just ain't flying. Let's just take it

01:28:47.700 --> 01:28:50.700
back to modern warfare. Let's just go back to our roots. Just go back to modern warfare,

01:28:51.700 --> 01:28:54.700
just do a modern warfare four. Let's just go back and punch some Nazis in the face.

01:28:55.700 --> 01:29:01.700
And just do it. World War II, Call of Duty was still fun, so I'm down to check that out.

01:29:02.700 --> 01:29:06.700
I do like the modern warfare games, though, because I got spoiled after I played, you

01:29:06.700 --> 01:29:11.700
know, the old ones, so we'll see. I'm curious. Stoppy in chat says, I do miss World War II

01:29:12.700 --> 01:29:15.700
shooters. So there you go. Yeah, and everyone was sick of them for a while. It just proves

01:29:16.700 --> 01:29:21.700
you got to, like, give it some time, you know, space that shit out. All right. Some other

01:29:22.700 --> 01:29:25.700
stuff we can talk about. Let's talk about Sony. So there's another rumor coming out

01:29:26.700 --> 01:29:30.700
that they're prepping yet another revision of the PlayStation 4. So apparently there's

01:29:30.700 --> 01:29:35.700
going to be an even slimmer model that's going to be coming out. And this is coming

01:29:36.700 --> 01:29:42.700
from Digitimes saying that they're prepping a thinner version of the PlayStation 4. This

01:29:43.700 --> 01:29:47.700
is not unlike Sony because they did revisions on the PlayStation 2 and 3 a few times.

01:29:48.700 --> 01:29:51.700
I know three went through at least two revisions and even Microsoft did the same thing

01:29:52.700 --> 01:29:57.700
with the Xbox 360. So it makes sense. What I what I would be curious about would be

01:29:57.700 --> 01:30:02.700
would this slimmer version get the pro specs? Could this be a slim pro? Or is the

01:30:04.700 --> 01:30:09.700
PlayStation Pro kind of like it's already over? But okay. Now, one thing I know we

01:30:10.700 --> 01:30:12.700
talked a lot about Mass Effect Andromeda at the beginning of the show. But one thing,

01:30:13.700 --> 01:30:16.700
you know, I need to mention some positives, you know, because I talk about the story

01:30:17.700 --> 01:30:20.700
still really good, the exploration. But one of the other like big positives is that

01:30:21.700 --> 01:30:25.700
it's really gorgeous. Like a lot of the scenery that you go through and the backgrounds

01:30:25.700 --> 01:30:29.700
I mean, it's like when you're in some of these vaults that you go into is fucking

01:30:30.700 --> 01:30:34.700
gorgeous. And yeah, I've been playing this on a PlayStation 4 Pro. Granted, I don't

01:30:35.700 --> 01:30:38.700
have a 4K TV. So yeah, I don't know why I own a pro either. I guess I was hoping to

01:30:39.700 --> 01:30:43.700
get those increased frame rates. But for what it's worth in Andromeda, it's been a

01:30:44.700 --> 01:30:47.700
smooth experience, even though, you know, there's been some of those bugs that we

01:30:48.700 --> 01:30:52.700
talked about, like everything still renders really smooth and so forth. So I'm kind

01:30:52.700 --> 01:30:57.700
of curious if maybe if PlayStation is going to slim things down again, might the

01:30:58.700 --> 01:31:01.700
pro specs be a new standard, especially if this is something that's going to happen

01:31:02.700 --> 01:31:05.700
towards the end of the year? You know, the price of the technology should have come

01:31:06.700 --> 01:31:12.700
down, right? I would hope, yeah. It'll be interesting to see. Yeah. Let's talk about

01:31:13.700 --> 01:31:18.700
Blizzard, I should say. It's also sort of Activision. Sort of. So they got this whole

01:31:18.700 --> 01:31:23.700
remaster of Starcraft coming out this summer. So I haven't actually heard about

01:31:24.700 --> 01:31:27.700
this yet, but apparently the remastered version is going to include all the same

01:31:28.700 --> 01:31:32.700
content from the original game, including the Brood War expansion. And they're

01:31:33.700 --> 01:31:38.700
going to give it a graphical overhaul with 4K Ultra HD updated audio and matchmaking

01:31:39.700 --> 01:31:43.700
support. And they're saying that they are also doing new illustrations to enhance

01:31:43.700 --> 01:31:49.700
the storytelling during the camping missions and cloud saves and custom made maps

01:31:50.700 --> 01:31:54.700
and key binds and all that fun stuff. You know, this was rumored during the last

01:31:55.700 --> 01:31:58.700
BlizzCon, which was a little bit, you know, it was kind of a lackluster BlizzCon.

01:31:59.700 --> 01:32:02.700
They didn't really announce a lot of big, big stuff besides what the Overwatch League,

01:32:03.700 --> 01:32:06.700
which we still don't even know much about, the Diablo Necromancer when everybody

01:32:07.700 --> 01:32:12.700
wanted an expansion or Diablo 4. But anyway, so the Starcraft remaster was

01:32:13.700 --> 01:32:16.700
rumored a few months ago. It's interesting. They chose to announce it now. I

01:32:17.700 --> 01:32:20.700
understand there was a, there was an event in Korea that they did this at, right?

01:32:21.700 --> 01:32:23.700
There's like an I heart Starcraft thing. And there's another cool thing too, is

01:32:24.700 --> 01:32:28.700
like with Brood War, they're also patching that they're doing an update. 1.18 is

01:32:29.700 --> 01:32:33.700
going to actually add some more bug features, improvements, and even observer

01:32:34.700 --> 01:32:37.700
mode and the ability to rebind keys. So that's something, even if you own the

01:32:38.700 --> 01:32:41.700
game, like part of the Starcraft anthology or something like that, you can

01:32:41.700 --> 01:32:44.700
actually download that and be able to update your game as well.

01:32:45.700 --> 01:32:48.700
Yeah, well, Blizzard's been patching like their games like ten years after the

01:32:49.700 --> 01:32:52.700
fact. Diablo 2 got a patch like a couple years ago. So, you know, it happens.

01:32:53.700 --> 01:32:58.700
But you guys have to remember, Starcraft is still huge in many places. And, you

01:32:59.700 --> 01:33:01.700
know, yes, Starcraft 2 is a thing. And yes, there's people that play that

01:33:02.700 --> 01:33:05.700
instead. But the original Starcraft is still like huge. So it's a pretty big

01:33:06.700 --> 01:33:09.700
deal for Blizzard to come out and say basically that we're not going to touch

01:33:09.700 --> 01:33:15.700
anything with balance. This is just like a cosmetic overhaul and that's it.

01:33:16.700 --> 01:33:18.700
Well, I guess there's also some things probably with the matchmaking and the

01:33:19.700 --> 01:33:23.700
fact that it'll actually be integrated with, I keep wanting to say Battle Net,

01:33:24.700 --> 01:33:27.700
but the Blizzard launcher, whatever the hell they're calling it now, Battle Net,

01:33:28.700 --> 01:33:30.700
they're basically integrating it into the same system that used the Overwatch.

01:33:31.700 --> 01:33:36.700
Battle Not. They Battle Not. Diablo 3 and World of Warcraft and all that use

01:33:36.700 --> 01:33:38.700
this. So now you should be able to see your friends as they're playing the

01:33:39.700 --> 01:33:43.700
original Starcraft should all be integrated into that. The HD version

01:33:44.700 --> 01:33:47.700
anyway. But I don't know if you were going to get into this. So sorry if I'm

01:33:48.700 --> 01:33:51.700
ruining something. But I believe I heard they're going to give away the original

01:33:52.700 --> 01:33:55.700
Starcraft as part of this, right? Or like just in like the coming week or

01:33:56.700 --> 01:33:59.700
something, you can actually get the old school Starcraft for free. Not the

01:34:00.700 --> 01:34:02.700
redo. You'll have to pay for that. I don't know how much you're going to charge

01:34:03.700 --> 01:34:05.700
for that. But if you've never gotten into Starcraft, you'll be able to get

01:34:06.700 --> 01:34:08.700
the original in the expansion just for free. They're just going to give it away

01:34:09.700 --> 01:34:13.700
even though they've sold it for 20 bucks. 20 bucks for a game from 1997 until now.

01:34:14.700 --> 01:34:16.700
And now they're finally just going to make it free for everybody. So that part's

01:34:17.700 --> 01:34:22.700
pretty cool. Yeah. Yeah. So, um, I'm, I'm fucking terrible at Starcraft, so I

01:34:23.700 --> 01:34:26.700
don't know if anything's going to make me better. I do own Starcraft 2, but I

01:34:27.700 --> 01:34:30.700
like all the arcade game things you can do in that. I don't, I'm terrible at the

01:34:31.700 --> 01:34:33.700
game itself. When you watch the people that are good at that game, like they

01:34:33.700 --> 01:34:38.700
have all of their key binds down. They're like building stuff like it's so fast.

01:34:39.700 --> 01:34:41.700
Like the way people move in that game. It's just like, I can't, I can't operate

01:34:42.700 --> 01:34:45.700
on that level. I just can't. So, but I think it's cool that they're remastering

01:34:46.700 --> 01:34:51.700
the game. Yeah. Like not trying to reinvent the wheel, but like, Hey, this

01:34:52.700 --> 01:34:57.700
game is still popular. Almost God, 20 years. We are here 20 years after the

01:34:58.700 --> 01:35:01.700
fact, this game is still popular. So we're just gonna give it a new coat of

01:35:01.700 --> 01:35:05.700
paint and that's it. We're not gonna fuck with what makes it still a loved

01:35:06.700 --> 01:35:09.700
game all these years later. So, um, I want to make sure I throw in a story here

01:35:10.700 --> 01:35:13.700
as well, because it's something that, uh, Jason had brought up in the intro to

01:35:14.700 --> 01:35:18.700
the show tonight, uh, is that good old galaxy or GOG, uh, also got an upgrade

01:35:19.700 --> 01:35:23.700
this week. GOG is, uh, up to version 1.2 of GOG galaxy, which is their front

01:35:24.700 --> 01:35:27.700
end. If you haven't used enough GOG, it's kind of like the steam client, if you

01:35:27.700 --> 01:35:31.700
will. God galaxy is their front end, which includes the store as well as the

01:35:32.700 --> 01:35:34.700
games that you bought. Now, obviously God kind of started with a lot of the retro

01:35:35.700 --> 01:35:39.700
stuff, but now they have a lot of more modern stuff, especially in the things, uh,

01:35:40.700 --> 01:35:43.700
in the marketplace as well. Yeah. Um, well, one of the big perks about the new

01:35:44.700 --> 01:35:48.700
version of God galaxy is that now there are universal cloud saves. Note this,

01:35:49.700 --> 01:35:53.700
it doesn't matter which game you're using for any game on GOG. They don't have

01:35:53.700 --> 01:35:57.700
to build an extra support for this. Galaxy 1.2 will let your saves be stored

01:35:58.700 --> 01:36:02.700
and synced online. So my assumption is it must tell these games that you have

01:36:03.700 --> 01:36:05.700
another drive on your computer that is actually located in the clouds. That's,

01:36:06.700 --> 01:36:08.700
I haven't used it yet, but that's my assumption, how something like this must

01:36:09.700 --> 01:36:12.700
work and work in every game is that it's putting a new cloud drive on your

01:36:13.700 --> 01:36:17.700
computer where all this stuff can pretty much be saved. So, uh, and this is cool

01:36:18.700 --> 01:36:21.700
because if you ever upgrade your PC, you won't lose your save files. They're all

01:36:21.700 --> 01:36:24.700
right there. I'm assuming if you go to a friend's house and log in or something,

01:36:25.700 --> 01:36:29.700
your cloud files will be right there. So, you know, GOG has to find ways to

01:36:30.700 --> 01:36:33.700
differentiate itself from steam because steam is still kind of the behemoth there

01:36:34.700 --> 01:36:37.700
and everybody flips the fuck out about steam sales, but not as many people flip

01:36:38.700 --> 01:36:42.700
the fuck out about GOG sales except I appreciate the rage nator will call into

01:36:43.700 --> 01:36:45.700
the show whenever there is a GOG sale, but you know what I mean? Like GOG has

01:36:46.700 --> 01:36:49.700
its proponents, but it's far outnumbered by the number of people that are still

01:36:49.700 --> 01:36:53.700
talking about steam. So, um, you know, GOG has to think of these other ways to

01:36:54.700 --> 01:36:58.700
push themselves forward. Um, something else that galaxy is going to be doing in

01:36:59.700 --> 01:37:03.700
1.2, there's a new in game overlay, so you can hit shift tab just like you can in

01:37:04.700 --> 01:37:07.700
steam and it brings up an overlay so you can have a chat system, notifications,

01:37:08.700 --> 01:37:11.700
achievements, and all that stuff. Also a screenshots now built in when you have

01:37:12.700 --> 01:37:16.700
F12. Um, so that's pretty cool, which, you know, I hate to say it, but that is all

01:37:16.700 --> 01:37:19.700
functionality that does exist within steam, but still good to try to bring, you

01:37:20.700 --> 01:37:23.700
know, a little bit of parody and, and, you know, the other feature they said that

01:37:24.700 --> 01:37:27.700
was a pretty major feature of 1.2 is that they're going to be allowing users to

01:37:28.700 --> 01:37:32.700
that customize what galaxies features are. Um, so they can turn off things that

01:37:33.700 --> 01:37:37.700
they don't want to unbloat the client basically. So they can, you know, um,

01:37:38.700 --> 01:37:41.700
also they have like a hibernate mode that's going to drop CPU usage and

01:37:41.700 --> 01:37:45.700
decrease battery life when you're, you know, getting mobiley or something like

01:37:46.700 --> 01:37:52.700
that. An FPS counter, bandwidth limiter, screenshot capturing, achievement rarity,

01:37:53.700 --> 01:37:59.700
stuff like that. Cool. Um, so, um, yeah, you can, uh, I think you have to be in

01:38:00.700 --> 01:38:03.700
their little preview thing or opt into betas to actually see this now. I don't

01:38:04.700 --> 01:38:06.700
think this rolls out for everybody till April, but I don't think they have a

01:38:07.700 --> 01:38:10.700
closed beta thing like, like Xbox one does or anything. I think you just opt in

01:38:11.700 --> 01:38:14.700
if you want to check it out. Although it might have bugs. So don't blame me if

01:38:15.700 --> 01:38:18.700
there's bugs. All right. Uh, look, you have something else for us. Then maybe

01:38:19.700 --> 01:38:21.700
we'll get to mailbag here soon. Yeah. We can talk about some of the Xbox one

01:38:22.700 --> 01:38:25.700
updates. So Xbox one is going to be adding some tournament features with their

01:38:26.700 --> 01:38:30.700
next update. So they're going to be adding support for ESL back tournaments in a

01:38:31.700 --> 01:38:35.700
thing called arena. Um, I guess the world of tanks is going to be one of the

01:38:36.700 --> 01:38:40.700
first games to support that. And you can join ranked matches and be notified of

01:38:41.700 --> 01:38:46.700
tournament progress and see the results. And they're saying that also that, um,

01:38:47.700 --> 01:38:51.700
along with that, they're going to add some more games to it later on. They're

01:38:52.700 --> 01:38:56.700
also going to be adding the ability to upload custom gamer pics so you can put

01:38:57.700 --> 01:39:00.700
your own gear picks on there now instead of just whatever they're offering you,

01:39:01.700 --> 01:39:05.700
which is kind of nice. And then, um, they're saying though that that's not

01:39:06.700 --> 01:39:09.700
going to be, they're going to be building that from your mobile phone or PC or

01:39:09.700 --> 01:39:13.700
even console. Um, and there, I didn't really see how they're going to police

01:39:14.700 --> 01:39:18.700
that. So if you see Dick pics on there and then, well, it's a work in progress.

01:39:19.700 --> 01:39:24.700
Um, and then of course, uh, with that, they're allowing you to log into a wifi

01:39:25.700 --> 01:39:30.700
network, uh, which needs browser for sign in authenticity. So you can actually,

01:39:31.700 --> 01:39:35.700
you know, it'll pop up your browser within there if you need to do that.

01:39:35.700 --> 01:39:40.700
So like you're at, you know, a school or something. Hmm. Yeah.

01:39:42.700 --> 01:39:46.700
Um, and then of course also they're allowing you to filter your library via

01:39:47.700 --> 01:39:52.700
Xbox 360 or Xbox one. You can pin items and to your activity feed and auto zoom

01:39:53.700 --> 01:39:55.700
using connect when you're using Skype. That's good.

01:39:56.700 --> 01:39:59.700
Cause my library on Xbox one's getting really bloated with all the Xbox 360

01:40:00.700 --> 01:40:01.700
backwards compatibility and the games with gold.

01:40:01.700 --> 01:40:04.700
Like there's a lot to scroll through. So I'm, I'm kind of glad they're,

01:40:05.700 --> 01:40:08.700
they're changing that up a little bit. Yeah. Um, some other cool stuff.

01:40:09.700 --> 01:40:13.700
There's some, some, they announced the games for games of gold for April.

01:40:14.700 --> 01:40:17.700
So you're going to get rise on Xbox one for the whole month of April.

01:40:18.700 --> 01:40:23.700
Um, and then I guess, uh, April 16th through May 15th,

01:40:24.700 --> 01:40:27.700
you're going to get the walking dead season two on Xbox one.

01:40:27.700 --> 01:40:30.700
And then on Xbox 360 for the first half of April,

01:40:31.700 --> 01:40:35.700
Darksiders in the second half, Assassin's Creed revelations.

01:40:36.700 --> 01:40:39.700
Um, cool. Let's see the rises on there. Yeah.

01:40:40.700 --> 01:40:42.700
Rise was one of the launch titles, right? Yeah, it was. Yeah.

01:40:43.700 --> 01:40:46.700
And then finally there is also some more backwards compatibility, um,

01:40:47.700 --> 01:40:51.700
information including yes, including they have added backwards compatibility

01:40:52.700 --> 01:40:54.700
support for Daytona USA.

01:40:57.700 --> 01:41:10.700
I've been waiting to play that song for years. Years.

01:41:11.700 --> 01:41:16.700
Always. We always need an excuse to do that. Um, so yeah, that's pretty awesome.

01:41:17.700 --> 01:41:21.700
And so along with that, you can also, um, I guess stacking and tower blocks

01:41:22.700 --> 01:41:25.700
deluxe was another, um, two titles that were added on there.

01:41:25.700 --> 01:41:28.700
Who fucking cares? Daytona. Exactly. Daytona.

01:41:29.700 --> 01:41:31.700
Sorry to the developers who worked very hard on those games,

01:41:32.700 --> 01:41:35.700
but maybe if you included a really catchy theme songs, right?

01:41:36.700 --> 01:41:38.700
That's right. Then, you know, exactly.

01:41:39.700 --> 01:41:40.700
So you really only have yourselves a blame for that.

01:41:43.700 --> 01:41:44.700
Uh, let's get to the mailbag.

01:41:50.700 --> 01:41:53.700
Every week you guys email us participate at orange long trader.com

01:41:53.700 --> 01:41:56.700
is the place to send your emails and we dive into the mailbag and pick

01:41:57.700 --> 01:42:00.700
some emails to read here on the show. Uh, or in the case of this week,

01:42:01.700 --> 01:42:04.700
we have one loan email to read on the show tonight, but it's a good one.

01:42:05.700 --> 01:42:07.700
So I'm going to jump into that right now since dark soccer is not here.

01:42:08.700 --> 01:42:10.700
I will, um, fulfill as, as the runner up at the pageant,

01:42:11.700 --> 01:42:13.700
I will fulfill her duties, uh, as a queen of the show.

01:42:14.700 --> 01:42:17.700
So, uh, participate at orange launch radio again,

01:42:18.700 --> 01:42:19.700
if you want to send us an email for a future week.

01:42:19.700 --> 01:42:23.700
Uh, but this email tonight comes to us from our pal James Nighthawk,

01:42:24.700 --> 01:42:26.700
who says salutations from across the pond.

01:42:27.700 --> 01:42:28.700
James Nighthawk here writing in from England.

01:42:29.700 --> 01:42:30.700
I've been meaning to mail for a while, but as we know,

01:42:31.700 --> 01:42:32.700
all know life gets in the way.

01:42:33.700 --> 01:42:36.700
I'm writing to hopefully trigger further conversation about the services

01:42:37.700 --> 01:42:39.700
provided on modern gaming consoles with some different perspectives

01:42:40.700 --> 01:42:41.700
to stir into the mix.

01:42:42.700 --> 01:42:44.700
You've recently been discussing the lack of streaming services

01:42:45.700 --> 01:42:46.700
and apps available on launch for the Nintendo switch.

01:42:46.700 --> 01:42:48.700
I agree with, or at least understand your arguments

01:42:49.700 --> 01:42:51.700
for many of the points you have all raised.

01:42:52.700 --> 01:42:53.700
However, I would like to offer some counterpoints.

01:42:54.700 --> 01:42:55.700
Please note when reading this,

01:42:56.700 --> 01:42:57.700
I'm not sure where I stand on this matter yet,

01:42:58.700 --> 01:42:59.700
so this is all good debate from my perspective.

01:43:00.700 --> 01:43:03.700
You mentioned that the landscape has changed since the launch days

01:43:04.700 --> 01:43:05.700
of the 360 PlayStation 3 Wii era.

01:43:06.700 --> 01:43:09.700
Netflix, YouTube, et al are now standard parts of our lives.

01:43:10.700 --> 01:43:12.700
Whereas back in 2006, the consoles were not weaker

01:43:13.700 --> 01:43:14.700
for lacking these services. This is true.

01:43:14.700 --> 01:43:16.700
The addition of Netflix and so forth to these systems

01:43:17.700 --> 01:43:19.700
arguably extended the lifespans of these consoles.

01:43:20.700 --> 01:43:23.700
I for one know many people for whom the Wii was the Netflix machine

01:43:24.700 --> 01:43:26.700
after the charm of Wii Sports started to wane.

01:43:27.700 --> 01:43:30.700
However, I proffer that the landscape has changed further still.

01:43:31.700 --> 01:43:33.700
Many televisions have built-in streaming services.

01:43:34.700 --> 01:43:37.700
The likes of Roku, Amazon, Fire Stick, Apple TV, and so on

01:43:38.700 --> 01:43:40.700
each offer cheap, quick methods for streaming.

01:43:41.700 --> 01:43:42.700
Running a games console for Netflix

01:43:42.700 --> 01:43:45.700
is arguably a needless use of electricity for many people

01:43:46.700 --> 01:43:48.700
when a light device with a convenient remote control

01:43:49.700 --> 01:43:51.700
or a built-in smart TV app does the job better.

01:43:52.700 --> 01:43:55.700
Not to mention the phones, tablets, laptops, and so forth many of us have.

01:43:56.700 --> 01:43:58.700
Let us consider the Kindle. No, not the Kindle Fire,

01:43:59.700 --> 01:44:00.700
the humble Kindle. Kindle, the e-reader.

01:44:01.700 --> 01:44:03.700
The Kindle of today does less than the older Kindles.

01:44:04.700 --> 01:44:06.700
My first Kindle had an experimental browser.

01:44:07.700 --> 01:44:08.700
The experiment, I can only assume,

01:44:09.700 --> 01:44:10.700
was to see how long the average person would use it

01:44:10.700 --> 01:44:13.700
before rolling their eyes, guffawing comically,

01:44:14.700 --> 01:44:16.700
and grabbing any other device to browse the internet.

01:44:17.700 --> 01:44:19.700
It was slow, monochrome, and unresponsive.

01:44:20.700 --> 01:44:22.700
It was a concept, a bad concept, that went no further.

01:44:23.700 --> 01:44:25.700
The Kindle does one thing. It does books, and it does books well.

01:44:26.700 --> 01:44:28.700
When I read on my tablet, notifications tempt me away.

01:44:29.700 --> 01:44:31.700
The ease of access to social media is omnipresent.

01:44:32.700 --> 01:44:33.700
Distractions, distractions, distractions.

01:44:34.700 --> 01:44:37.700
Equally, a tablet hasn't the right kind of screen for reading lengthy texts in bed,

01:44:37.700 --> 01:44:40.700
nor are they light enough to hold in one hand for hours at a time.

01:44:41.700 --> 01:44:43.700
The Kindle does one thing, and it does it well.

01:44:44.700 --> 01:44:45.700
Now, on to Nintendo.

01:44:46.700 --> 01:44:47.700
Like Rob, I've been thoroughly enjoying my Switch.

01:44:48.700 --> 01:44:49.700
I enjoy the light nature of the OS.

01:44:50.700 --> 01:44:51.700
It is snappy and simple, and when I'm using it,

01:44:52.700 --> 01:44:53.700
I'm doing one thing. I'm gaming.

01:44:54.700 --> 01:44:55.700
In an age where every device offers every service,

01:44:56.700 --> 01:44:58.700
having certain devices do one thing well is refreshing.

01:44:59.700 --> 01:45:02.700
Nintendo can't compete on gaming spec with Sony and Microsoft.

01:45:03.700 --> 01:45:05.700
They can't compete on apps with Apple or Android.

01:45:05.700 --> 01:45:08.700
What they do have in their corner are some of the most solid games in existence,

01:45:09.700 --> 01:45:11.700
in a flexible form that is both portable and dockable.

01:45:12.700 --> 01:45:15.700
By providing a simple, malleable gaming system that does nothing else,

01:45:16.700 --> 01:45:17.700
they can be seen as focusing their energies.

01:45:18.700 --> 01:45:20.700
I would like to reiterate, I'm not sure if this argument holds water.

01:45:21.700 --> 01:45:22.700
It will be interesting to see what happens in the coming few years.

01:45:23.700 --> 01:45:24.700
The iPhone killed the iPod.

01:45:25.700 --> 01:45:27.700
But this is because, in terms of sound quality and convenience,

01:45:28.700 --> 01:45:29.700
the iPhone made the iPod largely irrelevant.

01:45:30.700 --> 01:45:32.700
The iPhone does not make console gaming irrelevant,

01:45:33.700 --> 01:45:34.700
as touch gaming is no substitute for real controls.

01:45:35.700 --> 01:45:38.700
Equally, the Xbox One and PlayStation 4 do not make the Switch irrelevant,

01:45:39.700 --> 01:45:41.700
as they are not as flexible, nor do they have the Nintendo games.

01:45:42.700 --> 01:45:43.700
Nintendo may be on to something here.

01:45:44.700 --> 01:45:48.700
Choice is, yes, this is a long email, but it's good, so I'm going to read it all.

01:45:49.700 --> 01:45:50.700
Choice is, of course, paramount.

01:45:51.700 --> 01:45:52.700
Nintendo can offer Netflix, YouTube, and so on,

01:45:53.700 --> 01:45:54.700
and I can choose not to use them.

01:45:55.700 --> 01:45:57.700
But I do wonder how vital such apps are to the sales of the system.

01:45:58.700 --> 01:46:01.700
Most Switch owners are likely swimming in app-laden devices already.

01:46:01.700 --> 01:46:04.700
They purchase, or want to purchase, a Switch to play Nintendo games.

01:46:05.700 --> 01:46:09.700
Indeed, for the last five years, Nintendo has arguably scared off potential customers.

01:46:10.700 --> 01:46:12.700
Hear ye, hear ye, come play Nintendo's awesome games, they cry.

01:46:13.700 --> 01:46:15.700
Buy a Wii U for our awesome games, they exclaim.

01:46:16.700 --> 01:46:19.700
Oh, and a 3DS2 for other awesome games, they siren, louder still,

01:46:20.700 --> 01:46:23.700
now with beads of sweat congealing on their collective brows.

01:46:24.700 --> 01:46:26.700
In the end, many people chose to buy neither system,

01:46:27.700 --> 01:46:29.700
baffled by the choice of hardware and the division of games.

01:46:29.700 --> 01:46:32.700
The Switch is Nintendo's chance to rally Nintendo games

01:46:33.700 --> 01:46:35.700
and Nintendo fans behind one system, a gaming system.

01:46:36.700 --> 01:46:40.700
The rest is the cream on the, hopefully very tempting, piece of gadget pudding.

01:46:41.700 --> 01:46:43.700
Thanks for reading, and I hope my English vernacular hasn't befuddled you

01:46:44.700 --> 01:46:45.700
or your listeners too much.

01:46:46.700 --> 01:46:47.700
P.S. Jamie, you might like this.

01:46:48.700 --> 01:46:50.700
Well, she's not here tonight, but we'll try to enjoy it on her behalf.

01:46:51.700 --> 01:46:52.700
Regarding your use of the word hysterical

01:46:53.700 --> 01:46:55.700
when describing the internet dickheads threatening the EA worker last week,

01:46:55.700 --> 01:46:59.700
the word hysterical is derived from the Latin hysteria, meaning womb.

01:47:00.700 --> 01:47:04.700
Hysteria was originally defined as a neurotic condition peculiar to women

01:47:05.700 --> 01:47:07.700
and thought to be caused by a dysfunction of the uterus.

01:47:08.700 --> 01:47:10.700
A rather delicious linguistic irony there.

01:47:11.700 --> 01:47:12.700
I am a fan of irony.

01:47:13.700 --> 01:47:15.700
A good day to all, and to Jamie, resist.

01:47:16.700 --> 01:47:17.700
James Nighthawk.

01:47:18.700 --> 01:47:19.700
Wonderful email, thank you for sharing.

01:47:20.700 --> 01:47:21.700
I'm sure Jamie would give you a gold star if she was here,

01:47:22.700 --> 01:47:23.700
so I will give you a gold star in her steed.

01:47:23.700 --> 01:47:25.700
I think you do bring up good points in your email,

01:47:26.700 --> 01:47:28.700
but here's the one problem for me,

01:47:29.700 --> 01:47:31.700
and I think the one thing that you overlooked in your examples

01:47:32.700 --> 01:47:33.700
and the thing that I keep coming back to as to

01:47:34.700 --> 01:47:35.700
why am I holding Nintendo to a different standard

01:47:36.700 --> 01:47:37.700
with this whole Netflix thing.

01:47:38.700 --> 01:47:39.700
Yes, your TVs can do it.

01:47:40.700 --> 01:47:41.700
Yes, your phones can do it.

01:47:42.700 --> 01:47:45.700
But what your TV can't do is come off of the television

01:47:46.700 --> 01:47:48.700
and go into your pocket out the front door.

01:47:49.700 --> 01:47:50.700
And that's something the Switch does.

01:47:50.700 --> 01:47:55.700
And Nintendo has been selling the Switch for doing this for games,

01:47:56.700 --> 01:48:00.700
which is cool, but not all the, for lack of a better term,

01:48:01.700 --> 01:48:02.700
excuse me for this example,

01:48:03.700 --> 01:48:04.700
not all of the soccer moms out there,

01:48:05.700 --> 01:48:07.700
oh, excuse me, excuse me, football moms.

01:48:08.700 --> 01:48:09.700
Gotta forget I'm speaking to somebody on the other side of the pond.

01:48:10.700 --> 01:48:13.700
But all joking aside, we call them soccer moms here in the US.

01:48:14.700 --> 01:48:16.700
So all the soccer moms out there probably aren't gonna get it

01:48:17.700 --> 01:48:19.700
when it comes to games, but show them the moms.

01:48:20.700 --> 01:48:22.700
Show them the movie, the Netflix on the TV that,

01:48:23.700 --> 01:48:26.700
oh, gotta go sit in the doctor's office for this appointment.

01:48:27.700 --> 01:48:30.700
Obviously you don't want to encourage people to watch TV when they drive.

01:48:31.700 --> 01:48:33.700
So they're gonna have to kind of dance around that issue and that whole thing.

01:48:34.700 --> 01:48:35.700
But, you know, they could, even with the kids,

01:48:36.700 --> 01:48:37.700
the kids are watching a TV show and, oh,

01:48:38.700 --> 01:48:39.700
we gotta get going to grandma's or whatever.

01:48:40.700 --> 01:48:42.700
You can pick that show up right off the TV

01:48:43.700 --> 01:48:44.700
and take it with you right on out to the car.

01:48:45.700 --> 01:48:48.700
Now, although you may think right now with Netflix

01:48:48.700 --> 01:48:52.700
that's not possible because Netflix requires an always stable internet connection,

01:48:53.700 --> 01:48:57.700
remember a few months ago Netflix introduced the whole downloading things.

01:48:58.700 --> 01:49:00.700
So there's no reason why you couldn't queue something up on the Switch

01:49:01.700 --> 01:49:03.700
and as you watch it, the rest of the episode downloads.

01:49:04.700 --> 01:49:05.700
So at a certain point while you're watching it,

01:49:06.700 --> 01:49:09.700
now that thing is saved on your device, that movie or whatever you're watching.

01:49:10.700 --> 01:49:12.700
I realize Netflix's onboard storage could be a challenge with this,

01:49:13.700 --> 01:49:17.700
but I downloaded a movie to watch on a plane

01:49:18.700 --> 01:49:20.700
and it's only like 600 megabytes or something because, you know,

01:49:21.700 --> 01:49:23.700
it's only in like 720p, you know, or whatever.

01:49:24.700 --> 01:49:26.700
It's not, you know, the highest definition picture

01:49:27.700 --> 01:49:29.700
because those tablets aren't the highest definition things.

01:49:30.700 --> 01:49:34.700
But anyway, I think maybe that's my point with all this is that,

01:49:35.700 --> 01:49:37.700
okay, it's one thing to show the games up and on the go,

01:49:38.700 --> 01:49:41.700
but you could bring in even more people to buy this device for their families

01:49:42.700 --> 01:49:44.700
if you could show it with the TV as well.

01:49:45.700 --> 01:49:46.700
And that's kind of been my point.

01:49:46.700 --> 01:49:48.700
Like otherwise, sure, I agree with you.

01:49:49.700 --> 01:49:51.700
You don't need Netflix on every single device.

01:49:52.700 --> 01:49:54.700
The thing is the Switch does it differently

01:49:55.700 --> 01:49:57.700
and even Nintendo is trying to sell that in their argument.

01:49:58.700 --> 01:49:59.700
The Switch does gaming differently.

01:50:00.700 --> 01:50:02.700
Now you can pick it up and take it with you on the go wherever you want.

01:50:03.700 --> 01:50:06.700
So I just find it a missed opportunity, if you will,

01:50:07.700 --> 01:50:09.700
that they're not doing this with Netflix, Hulu,

01:50:10.700 --> 01:50:12.700
whatever movie technology would allow them to download on the go

01:50:13.700 --> 01:50:14.700
and all this and do it.

01:50:14.700 --> 01:50:16.700
Will they build in that technology by holiday?

01:50:17.700 --> 01:50:18.700
They might. That could be something that could happen.

01:50:19.700 --> 01:50:20.700
So I don't think this is a, you know,

01:50:21.700 --> 01:50:22.700
certainly not something they can't just, you know,

01:50:23.700 --> 01:50:24.700
backdoor into the system at some point or what have you.

01:50:25.700 --> 01:50:26.700
Is this something that's going to wreck the system

01:50:27.700 --> 01:50:28.700
if they never introduce it?

01:50:29.700 --> 01:50:31.700
Clearly not. The system's doing pretty well as it is right now.

01:50:32.700 --> 01:50:35.700
It definitely looks like it's going to have a more favorable outcome than Wii U

01:50:36.700 --> 01:50:39.700
and if Nintendo gets what they want, it might even end up better than the Wii.

01:50:39.700 --> 01:50:45.700
But I just think those types of apps can really kind of push it beyond just gamers.

01:50:46.700 --> 01:50:49.700
You know, and I know, I know, I know you guys are probably rolling your eyes

01:50:50.700 --> 01:50:51.700
because you're like, wait a minute, Rob.

01:50:52.700 --> 01:50:57.700
You can't sit there and go, well, Microsoft talks about TVs and movies

01:50:58.700 --> 01:51:01.700
and all this shit too much, but yet Nintendo doesn't talk about it enough.

01:51:02.700 --> 01:51:04.700
Yeah, but the difference is the technology.

01:51:05.700 --> 01:51:06.700
It's like James said in the email.

01:51:06.700 --> 01:51:11.700
The Xbox and what it was doing was reductive to what your television can already do.

01:51:12.700 --> 01:51:14.700
The Switch offers this new thing.

01:51:15.700 --> 01:51:16.700
You can pick it up and take it on the go.

01:51:17.700 --> 01:51:18.700
You can't do that with your TV.

01:51:19.700 --> 01:51:20.700
The only thing I can think of where maybe you could do that

01:51:21.700 --> 01:51:23.700
is if you had an Apple TV and an iPhone.

01:51:24.700 --> 01:51:27.700
I suppose that may exist, but that is two separate pieces of hardware,

01:51:28.700 --> 01:51:29.700
not one piece of hardware like the Switch is.

01:51:30.700 --> 01:51:33.700
So that's all. I just, I see it as a missed opportunity.

01:51:33.700 --> 01:51:37.700
But I think it's one Nintendo will probably inject into the system sooner rather than later.

01:51:38.700 --> 01:51:39.700
I don't know. Any, any thoughts, Loki?

01:51:40.700 --> 01:51:42.700
It's just added value. And even it would be nice just to take, like,

01:51:43.700 --> 01:51:47.700
not necessarily even Netflix movies, but it'd be nice if it would just do any sort of media playback,

01:51:48.700 --> 01:51:50.700
you know, throw some movies onto, because obviously, you know,

01:51:51.700 --> 01:51:53.700
you're not gonna always have Wi-Fi with the Switch and stuff.

01:51:54.700 --> 01:51:56.700
So say you're going on a plane or something like that

01:51:57.700 --> 01:51:58.700
and you want to watch some movies on a flight instead of having, like,

01:51:59.700 --> 01:52:01.700
to buy a tablet or have your phone or something to do that.

01:52:01.700 --> 01:52:06.700
You throw some movies onto, you know, the SD card and away you go.

01:52:07.700 --> 01:52:08.700
That'd be just nice.

01:52:09.700 --> 01:52:12.700
I'm reading some comments in chat over at live.vog network.com.

01:52:13.700 --> 01:52:14.700
Do I even know our own website?

01:52:15.700 --> 01:52:16.700
William Ritterface in chat says,

01:52:17.700 --> 01:52:19.700
Sky, you could conceivably do that with a laptop or a netbook.

01:52:20.700 --> 01:52:24.700
Okay, but, like, seriously, I realize the demographic listening to this show

01:52:25.700 --> 01:52:26.700
is not the every demographic out there,

01:52:27.700 --> 01:52:28.700
but how many people have their laptops hooked up to their TV?

01:52:29.700 --> 01:52:30.700
Not a lot.

01:52:31.700 --> 01:52:32.700
I mean, soccer moms of America.

01:52:33.700 --> 01:52:35.700
Do they all have their laptops hooked up to their TV and all this stuff?

01:52:36.700 --> 01:52:37.700
I don't think they do.

01:52:38.700 --> 01:52:39.700
Or how about kids?

01:52:40.700 --> 01:52:41.700
Laptops are kind of bulky, you know what I mean?

01:52:42.700 --> 01:52:44.700
Again, it's part of that magic of the Switch system.

01:52:45.700 --> 01:52:46.700
It just fucking works.

01:52:47.700 --> 01:52:49.700
If I didn't have a Wii U, let's just, like, switch it for the Switch,

01:52:50.700 --> 01:52:52.700
because really that's what my son uses the Wii U for,

01:52:53.700 --> 01:52:55.700
is he plays games on it and he'll watch YouTube on it.

01:52:56.700 --> 01:53:00.700
So, like, you know, if we didn't have the Wii U

01:53:01.700 --> 01:53:04.700
and he had the Switch instead, he could watch, you know, YouTube on that,

01:53:05.700 --> 01:53:07.700
or, like, you know, play games on that as well, like a tablet.

01:53:08.700 --> 01:53:10.700
I mean, he has a tablet now, too, but he didn't always have one.

01:53:11.700 --> 01:53:12.700
And even still, even though he does have a tablet,

01:53:13.700 --> 01:53:15.700
he still prefers to play some games on there.

01:53:16.700 --> 01:53:17.700
Like, he'll want to play Minecraft on there.

01:53:18.700 --> 01:53:19.700
He has Minecraft on the tablet, too.

01:53:20.700 --> 01:53:21.700
But he plays Minecraft on the Wii U, because it has the controls,

01:53:22.700 --> 01:53:23.700
and it's easier for him.

01:53:24.700 --> 01:53:25.700
Akdeft in chat says,

01:53:26.700 --> 01:53:28.700
Just wait for the holiday season. Netflix will be on the system by then.

01:53:28.700 --> 01:53:31.700
I do think at the end of the day you're probably right with that.

01:53:32.700 --> 01:53:34.700
Elliot B. in chat over at live.fognetwork.com says,

01:53:35.700 --> 01:53:37.700
How many consoles have launched with media stuff and dropped it later?

01:53:38.700 --> 01:53:40.700
3DS, Xbox One, Vita, question mark.

01:53:41.700 --> 01:53:44.700
Has the media stuff been dropped totally from any of those?

01:53:45.700 --> 01:53:48.700
I don't think Xbox One for sure. They have tons of media stuff on there.

01:53:49.700 --> 01:53:51.700
Yeah, Xbox One is still pushing that, and so does PlayStation 4.

01:53:52.700 --> 01:53:54.700
I mean, I still use a lot of Twitch on PlayStation 4,

01:53:55.700 --> 01:53:56.700
and I do use Netflix on PlayStation 4.

01:53:56.700 --> 01:53:58.700
I use 3DS because it's underpowered.

01:53:59.700 --> 01:54:02.700
I'm pretty sure 3DS still has Netflix, though.

01:54:03.700 --> 01:54:04.700
See, but here's the thing with the Vita.

01:54:05.700 --> 01:54:07.700
Sony dumped the Vita, at least in America.

01:54:08.700 --> 01:54:09.700
In Japan, different story.

01:54:10.700 --> 01:54:12.700
And maybe this is the other element of all that,

01:54:13.700 --> 01:54:14.700
and I honestly don't know the answer to this,

01:54:15.700 --> 01:54:19.700
is how big is Netflix and all that stuff in Japan?

01:54:20.700 --> 01:54:22.700
And maybe that's something I need to consider,

01:54:23.700 --> 01:54:25.700
because Nintendo is going to make decisions,

01:54:26.700 --> 01:54:28.700
not just based on what happens here in the U.S.,

01:54:29.700 --> 01:54:30.700
but what happens in Japan.

01:54:31.700 --> 01:54:33.700
Would there be a need for that, to have this type of Netflix type thing

01:54:34.700 --> 01:54:35.700
where you pick up and move in Japan,

01:54:36.700 --> 01:54:40.700
where transit is much more popular and all that stuff?

01:54:41.700 --> 01:54:42.700
Kaijuto in chat says,

01:54:43.700 --> 01:54:45.700
Vita has Netflix, just hasn't updated it.

01:54:46.700 --> 01:54:47.700
Elliot B says,

01:54:48.700 --> 01:54:49.700
Xbox One abandoned a lot of the TV stuff, right?

01:54:50.700 --> 01:54:54.700
I think that stuff where you direct plug in your cable into the back

01:54:54.700 --> 01:54:57.700
and your Xbox One was basically functioning as your cable box,

01:54:58.700 --> 01:55:00.700
I don't think that functionality is gone, per se,

01:55:01.700 --> 01:55:02.700
but I think it's just kind of flat-lined,

01:55:03.700 --> 01:55:04.700
like it's not really getting updated anymore.

01:55:05.700 --> 01:55:08.700
Like, the Wii U's TV thing, that got shut the fuck down.

01:55:09.700 --> 01:55:10.700
That's gone.

01:55:11.700 --> 01:55:12.700
That's something that got eliminated,

01:55:13.700 --> 01:55:14.700
but I don't think the Xbox One got rid of any of that.

01:55:15.700 --> 01:55:17.700
And certainly in the Netflix-style applications,

01:55:18.700 --> 01:55:19.700
your voodoos, your crackles,

01:55:20.700 --> 01:55:22.700
all the stuff that, when we say Netflix,

01:55:22.700 --> 01:55:24.700
we mean all this other stuff too,

01:55:25.700 --> 01:55:27.700
I think Xbox still has a lot of that stuff.

01:55:28.700 --> 01:55:33.700
But again, I think a lot of it is in low maintenance territory.

01:55:34.700 --> 01:55:38.700
Even Twitch, they just introduced communities on Twitch

01:55:39.700 --> 01:55:40.700
and all that stuff, right?

01:55:41.700 --> 01:55:42.700
I think the mobile versions of Twitch have that now,

01:55:43.700 --> 01:55:45.700
but I'm not sure the PlayStation 4 ones do.

01:55:46.700 --> 01:55:47.700
And I haven't used the Xbox Twitch in a little while,

01:55:48.700 --> 01:55:50.700
if they have that whole element in them now.

01:55:50.700 --> 01:55:53.700
But anyway.

01:55:54.700 --> 01:55:55.700
Alright.

01:55:56.700 --> 01:55:57.700
Thanks for the email.

01:55:58.700 --> 01:55:59.700
It was still a good discussion.

01:56:00.700 --> 01:56:01.700
I still appreciate the perspective and so forth,

01:56:02.700 --> 01:56:03.700
and I realize there are a lot of you

01:56:04.700 --> 01:56:05.700
that are very happy that they're focusing on the games.

01:56:06.700 --> 01:56:07.700
Don't get me wrong, I am too.

01:56:08.700 --> 01:56:09.700
I just see it as a missed opportunity

01:56:10.700 --> 01:56:13.700
if they really want to get those Wii-like numbers

01:56:14.700 --> 01:56:17.700
that are in the stratosphere of selling with a game console.

01:56:18.700 --> 01:56:19.700
But we'll see.

01:56:20.700 --> 01:56:21.700
I kind of think it's just going to end up there by holiday.

01:56:22.700 --> 01:56:25.700
I think the Switch today versus the Switch in December

01:56:26.700 --> 01:56:27.700
is going to look very, very, very different,

01:56:28.700 --> 01:56:29.700
which is why we did the whole time capsule joke a few episodes ago,

01:56:30.700 --> 01:56:33.700
to see what that's going to look like in December.

01:56:34.700 --> 01:56:35.700
Alright, if you want to email us for our future episode,

01:56:36.700 --> 01:56:39.700
participate at orangeloungeradio.com.

01:56:40.700 --> 01:56:42.700
In the meantime, I'm thinking Loki might have a couple more stories for us.

01:56:43.700 --> 01:56:44.700
Yeah, well, we can also probably do release dates.

01:56:45.700 --> 01:56:46.700
Oh, yeah, that whole thing.

01:56:47.700 --> 01:56:48.700
I guess I should probably try to find the Japanese release dates.

01:56:48.700 --> 01:56:50.700
Okay, why don't you talk about what's happening in the US while I...

01:56:51.700 --> 01:56:54.700
Sure. So, this week we actually do have quite a few things coming out.

01:56:55.700 --> 01:56:57.700
So, starting off, Has-Been Heroes is coming out on PC,

01:56:58.700 --> 01:57:01.700
the Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

01:57:02.700 --> 01:57:04.700
Also, we have Kingdom Hearts HD 1.5 Remix

01:57:05.700 --> 01:57:10.700
and Kingdom Hearts HD 2.5 Remix coming out on PlayStation 4.

01:57:11.700 --> 01:57:14.700
MLB The Show 17 on PlayStation 4.

01:57:14.700 --> 01:57:18.700
A game called Old Time Hockey on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

01:57:19.700 --> 01:57:22.700
Parappa the Rapper Remastered on PlayStation 4.

01:57:23.700 --> 01:57:29.700
Walking Dead Season 3 Episode 3 on pretty much all the different formats that that's on.

01:57:30.700 --> 01:57:33.700
PC, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and mobile.

01:57:34.700 --> 01:57:39.700
Attack on Titan Escape from Certain Death on the 3DS.

01:57:40.700 --> 01:57:42.700
Blue Reflection on PlayStation 4 and Vita.

01:57:42.700 --> 01:57:45.700
The Alliance Alive on 3DS.

01:57:46.700 --> 01:57:48.700
This one's actually pretty awesome. I'm looking forward to playing this.

01:57:49.700 --> 01:57:54.700
Thimbleweed Park. Remember that was the game that was the old LucasArts style point-and-click game.

01:57:55.700 --> 01:57:59.700
It's actually done by... What's his name? I can't remember now.

01:58:00.700 --> 01:58:03.700
The guy that did the original Maniac Mansion games and stuff like that.

01:58:04.700 --> 01:58:06.700
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. I know what you're talking about.

01:58:07.700 --> 01:58:09.700
Ron Gilbert? Yeah, Ron Gilbert. Okay.

01:58:10.700 --> 01:58:14.700
And, let's see, Musostars on PlayStation 4 and Vita.

01:58:15.700 --> 01:58:19.700
Oh, and in case I didn't mention, Thimbleweed Park. That's Xbox One and PC, Mac, and Linux.

01:58:20.700 --> 01:58:27.700
And finally, Overload on PC, Mac, Linux, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

01:58:28.700 --> 01:58:31.700
I want to say there was one other one on here. I didn't see it.

01:58:32.700 --> 01:58:35.700
But I know I had it on the other list here.

01:58:35.700 --> 01:58:41.700
I'm not positive because I don't see it on this list, but I want to say Strafe, I think, was coming out this week as well.

01:58:42.700 --> 01:58:48.700
And that's kind of like a Quake, Duke Nukem style first-person shooter game.

01:58:49.700 --> 01:58:51.700
So it's like that retro 90s stuff that's on PC.

01:58:52.700 --> 01:58:54.700
That was a busy week. You know what else is this week?

01:58:55.700 --> 01:58:59.700
There's a patch in Final Fantasy XIV, which, you know, for me, because I'm into that game, so that's a big deal.

01:58:59.700 --> 01:59:05.700
But also, Final Fantasy XV, the Gladio DLC, is this week, as is the Chapter XIII redo.

01:59:06.700 --> 01:59:07.700
So I guess I'll have to go back and play XV then.

01:59:08.700 --> 01:59:12.700
Yeah, so it's a pretty big week. I mean, Square's dumping a lot on us with the Kingdom Hearts thing, too.

01:59:13.700 --> 01:59:18.700
This is actually the week I've been waiting for for a couple years now.

01:59:19.700 --> 01:59:22.700
Because, you know, I didn't buy the Kingdom Hearts 2.5 thing when it came out.

01:59:23.700 --> 01:59:26.700
Because I said, they're going to put this on PlayStation 4 eventually, just like they did Final Fantasy X.

01:59:26.700 --> 01:59:27.700
Of course.

01:59:28.700 --> 01:59:32.700
So here we are. It's finally coming out, so I'm finally going to pick it up and might as well get the one.

01:59:33.700 --> 01:59:39.700
Even though I did buy the Final Fantasy I, because that was a few years ago, I bought the 1.5 or whatever on the PlayStation 3.

01:59:40.700 --> 01:59:41.700
It'll be nice to have that all on the PlayStation 4.

01:59:42.700 --> 01:59:49.700
Because, you know, I'll have time to jump into another, what, probably 300 hours worth of RPGs in between the Mass Effect and Dromedan.

01:59:50.700 --> 01:59:51.700
I'm trying to still beat, so yeah.

01:59:52.700 --> 01:59:55.700
Anyway, let's travel to Japan and check out what's coming out over there.

01:59:56.700 --> 02:00:05.700
In Japan this week, on March 28th, oh no, excuse me, I've got to push out to March 30th to get to Chaos, Child, Love, Chuchu on the PlayStation 4.

02:00:06.700 --> 02:00:09.700
Musou Stars, also out there as well this week.

02:00:10.700 --> 02:00:18.700
Also in Japan, Re Zero, Kada, Hajime-ru, Isekai, Sekkatsu, Death of Kiss in regular and limited edition.

02:00:19.700 --> 02:00:22.700
And Darius Burst, Chronicle Saviors, also out in Japan this week.

02:00:22.700 --> 02:00:29.700
Lastly, Blue Reflection, Maboroshi, Ni-mao, Shouju no Ken, also out in Japan this week.

02:00:30.700 --> 02:00:33.700
And then on the Vita this week, that Musou Star is also being released on the Vita.

02:00:34.700 --> 02:00:39.700
Zero, Kada, Hajime-ru, Isekai, Sekkatsu, Death of Kiss, also on the Vita.

02:00:40.700 --> 02:00:48.700
As is Tokyo Xanadu, Blue Reflection, Maboroshi, Ni-mao, Shoujo no Ken, and Chaos, Child, Love, Chuchu.

02:00:48.700 --> 02:00:52.700
So a lot of those same games on PlayStation 4 are also on the Vita over in Japan.

02:00:53.700 --> 02:00:58.700
Lastly, checking the Switch, I don't think there's anything out on the Switch.

02:00:59.700 --> 02:01:02.700
It looks like there's one game, there's Sango Kushi 13 with a power-up kit.

02:01:03.700 --> 02:01:05.700
And I think this is another one of those, like, Romance of the Three Kingdoms types of games.

02:01:06.700 --> 02:01:08.700
That's out on the Switch this week over in Japan.

02:01:09.700 --> 02:01:10.700
So, there you go.

02:01:12.700 --> 02:01:14.700
The UK, do you happen to have those handy?

02:01:15.700 --> 02:01:16.700
Yes I do.

02:01:16.700 --> 02:01:18.700
Oh my gosh, saves the day. What's up going on in the UK?

02:01:19.700 --> 02:01:22.700
So in the UK we've got Strafe coming out on PC and Mac.

02:01:23.700 --> 02:01:27.700
We've got Snake Pass on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.

02:01:28.700 --> 02:01:36.700
And last but not least, Atari Flashback Classic Volume 1 and Classic Volume 2 on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

02:01:37.700 --> 02:01:38.700
Those have been out here for a little bit.

02:01:39.700 --> 02:01:43.700
It's like just getting a flashback console in game form, so whatever.

02:01:43.700 --> 02:01:46.700
Yeah, so, that's it.

02:01:47.700 --> 02:01:50.700
Alright, let's see, you got some more news for us to talk about?

02:01:51.700 --> 02:01:55.700
Sure, let's talk about Castlevania Symphony Night, it's turned 20.

02:01:56.700 --> 02:01:57.700
Oh my god.

02:01:58.700 --> 02:01:59.700
It's been a long time.

02:02:00.700 --> 02:02:01.700
Congratulations, everybody's old.

02:02:02.700 --> 02:02:03.700
Exactly.

02:02:04.700 --> 02:02:10.700
Let's see, so this is a little bit of drama, but there's that game, Yooka-Laylee, that's coming out.

02:02:10.700 --> 02:02:20.700
And apparently a YouTuber by the name of JonTron, or Jon Jafari, who you may have recognized from social media recently because he said some choice things.

02:02:21.700 --> 02:02:26.700
He has been dropped from the game because of his comments.

02:02:27.700 --> 02:02:36.700
Playtronic basically made the comment, JonTron is a talented video presenter who we were initially two years ago happy to include as a voice contributor in our game.

02:02:36.700 --> 02:02:47.700
However, in light of the recent personal viewpoints, or his personal viewpoints, we have made the decision to remove JonTron's inclusion from the game via a forthcoming content update.

02:02:48.700 --> 02:03:00.700
We would like to make it absolutely clear that we do not endorse or support JonTron's personal viewpoints, and that as an external fan contributor, he does not represent Playtronic in any capacity.

02:03:01.700 --> 02:03:03.700
So, drama be drama.

02:03:04.700 --> 02:03:05.700
Whelp.

02:03:06.700 --> 02:03:09.700
Freedom of speech does not mean freedom from consequence, that's all it is.

02:03:10.700 --> 02:03:11.700
This is very true.

02:03:12.700 --> 02:03:13.700
That's what it boils down to.

02:03:14.700 --> 02:03:16.700
And I got nothing else to say about that.

02:03:17.700 --> 02:03:19.700
What's up next?

02:03:20.700 --> 02:03:22.700
How do we follow that?

02:03:23.700 --> 02:03:26.700
Let's see, what should we talk about next?

02:03:27.700 --> 02:03:33.700
I should have had the little bleep bleep, that's all folks queued up, because that seems the only thing that's appropriate for that moment.

02:03:34.700 --> 02:03:37.700
Let's just follow that with some awkward silence.

02:03:38.700 --> 02:03:44.700
Since we just talked about the anniversary of Symphony Night, I think it's only fair that we talk a little bit about Bloodstained.

02:03:45.700 --> 02:03:50.700
So Bloodstained, I'm sure it's going to come as a shock, it's officially not coming out for the Wii U.

02:03:51.700 --> 02:03:52.700
Oh my god!

02:03:53.700 --> 02:03:54.700
So basically they said, you know...

02:03:54.700 --> 02:03:56.700
I feel like we've reported this three times now.

02:03:57.700 --> 02:04:01.700
I think we just assumed that it wasn't coming out for the Wii U, but now it's not officially coming out.

02:04:02.700 --> 02:04:09.700
So, you know, thank you for supporting us, and the people that backed the Wii U version during the campaign.

02:04:10.700 --> 02:04:13.700
The Wii U was the height of popularity, and because of...

02:04:14.700 --> 02:04:16.700
Okay, maybe that's a little stretch, but whatever.

02:04:17.700 --> 02:04:18.700
Those are some very nice things to say.

02:04:19.700 --> 02:04:21.700
It was at the height of its popularity.

02:04:21.700 --> 02:04:22.700
Okay, okay.

02:04:23.700 --> 02:04:24.700
That's fair.

02:04:25.700 --> 02:04:29.700
But the situation has drastically changed after the release of the Nintendo Switch.

02:04:30.700 --> 02:04:35.700
This change has made it difficult to receive the necessary support from the hardware maker, which has led us to drop the Wii U development.

02:04:36.700 --> 02:04:38.700
And shift the development to the Nintendo Switch.

02:04:39.700 --> 02:04:41.700
Well that sucks if it's Nintendo's fault that they're not able to do that, but...

02:04:42.700 --> 02:04:47.700
Okay, wait, I gotta hear more about this comment over on chat over at live.vognumber.com.

02:04:48.700 --> 02:04:51.700
Stoppy in chat says Kickstarter scans and underdelivers once again.

02:04:52.700 --> 02:04:53.700
I...

02:04:54.700 --> 02:04:55.700
So is this...

02:04:56.700 --> 02:04:58.700
Are you mad it's not coming to Wii U because you don't have a Switch yet?

02:04:59.700 --> 02:05:01.700
I mean, I guess that's the one section of people I could see that are pissed.

02:05:02.700 --> 02:05:05.700
Is that you own a Wii U but you don't own a Switch because you don't have the money for a Switch yet.

02:05:06.700 --> 02:05:07.700
So you were kinda hoping to get this game on Wii U.

02:05:07.700 --> 02:05:16.700
For the most... I imagine most people that are Nintendo fans have already moved on to the Switch or will be planning to by the time this game comes out.

02:05:17.700 --> 02:05:18.700
Because it's still a next year game, right?

02:05:19.700 --> 02:05:20.700
Still 2018.

02:05:21.700 --> 02:05:23.700
So there's still plenty of time to get on board with the Switch or what have you.

02:05:24.700 --> 02:05:25.700
So I'm assuming...

02:05:27.700 --> 02:05:29.700
I'm assuming, yeah, most Nintendo people are gonna make that Switch.

02:05:30.700 --> 02:05:34.700
However, I also know money ain't everywhere.

02:05:34.700 --> 02:05:37.700
So some people really... you know, you can't just go out and buy a Switch today.

02:05:38.700 --> 02:05:39.700
You have to save up and do that.

02:05:40.700 --> 02:05:44.700
So it's kinda... it can probably be irritating if you bought this game already with Kickstarter or what have you.

02:05:45.700 --> 02:05:48.700
And then now here it is that it's not even gonna be coming out on the Wii U and it's gonna come out on the Switch.

02:05:51.700 --> 02:05:53.700
Oh, Stoppy says I was being sarcastic.

02:05:54.700 --> 02:05:55.700
Oh, okay.

02:05:56.700 --> 02:05:59.700
Well, dammit, I was actually looking for some counter perspective here.

02:06:00.700 --> 02:06:04.700
Where every gamer has a voice, even your sassy ass voice.

02:06:05.700 --> 02:06:06.700
Alright, so okay.

02:06:07.700 --> 02:06:11.700
I guess that is the only counterpoint I can think of is that not everybody can just run out and buy a Switch.

02:06:12.700 --> 02:06:18.700
But you do have a year to save up, so you just start putting $5 in the piggy bank every week.

02:06:19.700 --> 02:06:22.700
So here's another thing, a little tease I guess.

02:06:23.700 --> 02:06:33.700
The official Secret of Mana Twitter account has shown a clip of Seiken Densetsu 3 running on the Switch.

02:06:34.700 --> 02:06:39.700
Of course, that game never left Japan and it is a Japanese Twitter account.

02:06:40.700 --> 02:06:42.700
Looks like it might be running in Virtual Console.

02:06:43.700 --> 02:06:44.700
Oh, did you... you didn't see the follow up for this.

02:06:45.700 --> 02:06:48.700
They actually did release this... they did announce the Seiken Densetsu collection.

02:06:49.700 --> 02:06:50.700
So that was... so you must have missed that.

02:06:50.700 --> 02:06:51.700
I did miss that.

02:06:52.700 --> 02:06:53.700
That's why I'm here.

02:06:54.700 --> 02:06:56.700
They are going to release in Japan and I think it's in June.

02:06:57.700 --> 02:06:58.700
Somebody in chat correct me if I'm wrong on that.

02:06:59.700 --> 02:07:00.700
Because again, we're winging it tonight.

02:07:01.700 --> 02:07:04.700
If you're just joining us, we didn't get to produce tonight's show due to some website errors that were happening.

02:07:05.700 --> 02:07:06.700
So we're winging it a little bit.

02:07:07.700 --> 02:07:08.700
So that's okay that Loki didn't pick this up.

02:07:09.700 --> 02:07:10.700
But, oh yeah, when I saw this come out on Twitter I was all over this.

02:07:11.700 --> 02:07:12.700
So it's official, the Seiken Densetsu collection is happening.

02:07:13.700 --> 02:07:14.700
So it's going to be 1, 2, and 3.

02:07:15.700 --> 02:07:16.700
So that's Secret of Mana and Seiken Densetsu 3.

02:07:16.700 --> 02:07:24.700
And then what is Final Fantasy Legend on Gameboy here will all be released on one Switch cart in Japan.

02:07:25.700 --> 02:07:31.700
Now because the Switch is region free... you could buy that here in the US as well.

02:07:32.700 --> 02:07:35.700
However, all those games are still in Japanese.

02:07:36.700 --> 02:07:41.700
And the pack is going to cost like... was it 4,500 yen?

02:07:41.700 --> 02:07:48.700
So it's like, it's going to be at least $40 for 3 old games.

02:07:49.700 --> 02:07:51.700
Now, you know, they're not just any 3 old games.

02:07:52.700 --> 02:07:53.700
4,800 yen.

02:07:54.700 --> 02:07:57.700
Yeah, 4,800 yen. So again, that's around like 45 bucks, 40 bucks.

02:07:58.700 --> 02:08:05.700
So if they release that in the US, well I don't know, are they going to translate those games for the US?

02:08:06.700 --> 02:08:07.700
We'll have to see what happens with that.

02:08:07.700 --> 02:08:13.700
I think that could be huge though. I think there will be people that will pay $40 for an English translation in Seiken Densetsu 3.

02:08:14.700 --> 02:08:15.700
It doesn't matter that that game is fucking old.

02:08:16.700 --> 02:08:19.700
They would also translate Mother 3 and they would probably pay a lot of money for that too.

02:08:20.700 --> 02:08:26.700
You know what? You know what? Depending on... Loki, this is a different time now.

02:08:27.700 --> 02:08:31.700
I think that may not necessarily be off the table, if that makes sense.

02:08:31.700 --> 02:08:38.700
Especially if they do translate this to English, and it does well, and I don't want to get too excited.

02:08:39.700 --> 02:08:44.700
I'm tempering my enthusiasm because I don't expect that they're going to go back and make an English translation in Seiken Densetsu 3.

02:08:45.700 --> 02:08:48.700
Well, do you want to hear my controversial opinion on this?

02:08:49.700 --> 02:08:53.700
Why not? Why not? Let Rob get some hate mail for a change because not everybody is going to agree with me on this.

02:08:54.700 --> 02:08:58.700
I think they should just snatch the translation that's already been done and put it out.

02:08:58.700 --> 02:09:06.700
And some of you are going to be like, the fuck? That was a fan translation that people did. Yeah, well...

02:09:07.700 --> 02:09:08.700
What are you going to do about it?

02:09:09.700 --> 02:09:10.700
It was Square's game. What are they going to do about it?

02:09:11.700 --> 02:09:12.700
You going to sue them?

02:09:13.700 --> 02:09:16.700
It was Square's game that you all translated so you could play it free in an emulator for a year.

02:09:17.700 --> 02:09:18.700
That would suck.

02:09:19.700 --> 02:09:21.700
It's time for Square to get some of their money back, so to speak.

02:09:22.700 --> 02:09:24.700
I know that opinion is not going to be popular, but...

02:09:25.700 --> 02:09:26.700
But it is something they could do.

02:09:26.700 --> 02:09:30.700
If that's what they have to do to get the game out in English...

02:09:31.700 --> 02:09:39.700
It may be what they're doing. Remember, there was the virtual console games that had ROM dumps that were done by other people that somehow ended up in there, so...

02:09:40.700 --> 02:09:42.700
It's possible they could do that.

02:09:43.700 --> 02:09:48.700
JD in chat says, what's the licensing on the fan translation? The answer I'm giving is, does it matter?

02:09:50.700 --> 02:09:54.700
Again, I know that's not an opinion everybody's going to like, but does it matter?

02:09:57.700 --> 02:10:00.700
It was Square Enix's game. It was their words originally, right?

02:10:01.700 --> 02:10:13.700
It technically still is their game, and they could argue that you're in violation of the copyright by reverse engineering the game, so they could take it down the fan translation, even though that is something that people do.

02:10:14.700 --> 02:10:29.700
Now JD does have a more reasonable counterargument here, saying the game company's lawyers are not going to use it unless the translation was done under the most copyleft license, meaning it was a broad license or whatever, because it leaves them open to a lawsuit.

02:10:30.700 --> 02:10:31.700
But, I mean...

02:10:32.700 --> 02:10:33.700
It's just words.

02:10:36.700 --> 02:10:38.700
It would be interesting. I'm just saying it would be interesting.

02:10:39.700 --> 02:10:40.700
It would be an interesting lawsuit.

02:10:40.700 --> 02:10:47.700
I don't think that's what Square is really going to do. Now, to put all this wank aside, Square would localize it themselves.

02:10:48.700 --> 02:10:51.700
They could do it. It would be morally wrong, I think.

02:10:52.700 --> 02:10:54.700
It's going to be a very strange group. That would be a hell of a court case.

02:10:55.700 --> 02:10:59.700
They could do it because, I mean, it's a big company versus just some people that did it for fun.

02:11:00.700 --> 02:11:02.700
Who may not even care anymore. I don't know. I don't remember who did it.

02:11:02.700 --> 02:11:07.700
They don't have the money to defend themselves, so, I mean, really, a big company could do this.

02:11:08.700 --> 02:11:13.700
Though, people might not think too highly of them after they did that, but I don't know.

02:11:14.700 --> 02:11:20.700
Interesting. So, Elliott B. in chat says, it's just words, me pirating a million ebooks.

02:11:21.700 --> 02:11:30.700
Here's the thing, though. Now, did the fan translation, didn't they translate words that were already written?

02:11:33.700 --> 02:11:36.700
Technically, yes. Or did they rewrite it?

02:11:37.700 --> 02:11:38.700
They may have done both.

02:11:39.700 --> 02:11:44.700
Okay, if they rewrote it, then I get that argument a lot more than if they just translated what was already written.

02:11:45.700 --> 02:11:46.700
Because then I think that's a little apples and oranges.

02:11:47.700 --> 02:11:53.700
It's technically derivative, but I don't know. That would be kind of a weird gray area. I don't know how that would necessarily work.

02:11:54.700 --> 02:11:59.700
Let's see, BlackWolf in our chat over at live.vognetware.com says, podcasts are just words.

02:12:00.700 --> 02:12:06.700
Well, I can make money off this show? When's that gonna happen? It's only year 15.

02:12:07.700 --> 02:12:10.700
Well, you see, we need to have a Kickstarter and then a Patreon.

02:12:11.700 --> 02:12:17.700
Oh, I gotta tell people it costs $35,000 a year to do a podcast. That's right. I gotta tell them we have studio fees to pay for.

02:12:18.700 --> 02:12:20.700
We have to pay people to produce it for us.

02:12:20.700 --> 02:12:22.700
You said the hookers aren't gonna pay for themselves, okay?

02:12:23.700 --> 02:12:26.700
That's right, that's right. I forgot about all that stuff. Anyway.

02:12:27.700 --> 02:12:31.700
Buying pizza almost every week is expensive.

02:12:32.700 --> 02:12:38.700
Anyway, all this wank aside and the shade y'all are throwing at me, it's not gonna happen.

02:12:39.700 --> 02:12:42.700
If Square Enix does the English translation, they will do it themselves in-house.

02:12:42.700 --> 02:12:46.700
And we'll see. I'm just curious if they are gonna do it or not.

02:12:47.700 --> 02:12:54.700
Because that is gonna be resources that are way more than probably packaging these three games otherwise on the Switch.

02:12:55.700 --> 02:12:59.700
But the whole wild card with this is the fact that it is region free.

02:13:00.700 --> 02:13:03.700
You will be able to buy this and it will play on your North American Switch.

02:13:04.700 --> 02:13:06.700
So surely Square Enix has to realize that.

02:13:06.700 --> 02:13:13.700
But, you know, I doubt there are a ton of gamer people there in North America that are fluent in Japanese.

02:13:14.700 --> 02:13:20.700
It's all math. So if it makes sense for them and they can make money from it, then they'll do it.

02:13:21.700 --> 02:13:25.700
It's all about what investment they put in it and what the return is gonna be. That's what it comes down to.

02:13:26.700 --> 02:13:31.700
So let's hope that they experiment with something and it does well, then it just leads to more other things.

02:13:31.700 --> 02:13:36.700
Yeah. I mean, come on. How long would it take to translate a game like that?

02:13:37.700 --> 02:13:41.700
You already have people doing it. They could kind of crib some of that shit. I'm just saying, you know.

02:13:42.700 --> 02:13:44.700
Don't open that door again. I already got enough shades.

02:13:45.700 --> 02:13:51.700
But I will say this. It is at this point old technology.

02:13:51.700 --> 02:14:01.700
So do they have all the old Super Nintendo stuff available to go in and crack the ROMs the way they could, you know, 20 years ago?

02:14:02.700 --> 02:14:04.700
That may be the thing, is that they don't have the tools to do it anymore.

02:14:05.700 --> 02:14:14.700
That's like handing me a reel, an audio reel, and asking me to edit it together when it's like, dude, everything went digital years ago.

02:14:15.700 --> 02:14:20.700
They don't have the tools. I was unaware that these companies have no access to the internet.

02:14:21.700 --> 02:14:25.700
It was so befuddling to me that they couldn't figure this out.

02:14:26.700 --> 02:14:35.700
I think if people that are not associated with this company can make tools to do that, I'm pretty sure these companies can make tools to do that if they don't already have tools.

02:14:36.700 --> 02:14:40.700
Because guess what? They put out virtual console games, so they obviously have some shit to adjust those ROMs.

02:14:41.700 --> 02:14:44.700
Come on. Don't quit before you've even started.

02:14:45.700 --> 02:14:48.700
All right. Let's move on. Let's go to another story.

02:14:48.700 --> 02:14:54.700
All right, so this is kind of fun. Speaking of, like, I was talking about that whole water festival thing.

02:14:55.700 --> 02:14:59.700
Guess what came out with the water festival thing for Pokemon Go?

02:15:00.700 --> 02:15:04.700
The fucking thing breaking my Pokemon Go Plus all the time now, whatever that version of it is?

02:15:05.700 --> 02:15:15.700
Yes, it does that, but no, I'm talking about something that'd be more interesting to a certain somebody that listens to the show and also has a show on our network who happens to be obsessed by this.

02:15:15.700 --> 02:15:16.700
Shinies.

02:15:17.700 --> 02:15:19.700
That's right. Only Magikarp.

02:15:20.700 --> 02:15:22.700
Only Magikarp, but they have a shiny Magikarp now.

02:15:23.700 --> 02:15:27.700
And so, yeah, it's a yellow Magikarp, turns into a red Gyarados.

02:15:28.700 --> 02:15:32.700
By the way, for the record, on the way to the movie, I asked said person about that.

02:15:33.700 --> 02:15:42.700
Because I actually, we were right by. I had to get work done on my car this weekend, so he was good enough to come pick me up at the car place so we could go to the movie while I was getting the car worked on.

02:15:42.700 --> 02:15:48.700
And the car is right by one of the big Ingress farms out in Folsom, right?

02:15:49.700 --> 02:15:56.700
So I was like, oh, well, while we're here, do you want to just drive through? Because I know this is a big farm for Ingress, so it's got to be a ton of PokeStops. You want to drive through and get PokeBalls?

02:15:57.700 --> 02:16:00.700
He's like, I don't play Pokemon Go. I was like, did you not hear about the shinies?

02:16:01.700 --> 02:16:07.700
So, by the way, if y'all want to know what happened to PokeStop Podcast, that's what happened to PokeStop Podcast.

02:16:10.700 --> 02:16:11.700
Just saying.

02:16:13.700 --> 02:16:14.700
Alright.

02:16:15.700 --> 02:16:19.700
Anyways, so this is another thing that's going on with the Nintendo Switch.

02:16:20.700 --> 02:16:28.700
So there's this company, Game Truck, who does these mobile trucks that you can rent and they bring them to locations and they have games inside of them.

02:16:29.700 --> 02:16:38.700
Well, Nintendo's partnered with them now and they're going to have some that are going to be, 100 of the game trucks are going to have playable versions of 1-2 Switch and Legends all the breath of the wild on Switch systems.

02:16:38.700 --> 02:16:41.700
And, of course, they're going to be adding Mario Kart 8 later on when it comes out in April.

02:16:42.700 --> 02:16:47.700
So you can reserve your game truck now and they're going to have that promotion going on through June 20th.

02:16:50.700 --> 02:16:51.700
That sounds incredibly boring.

02:16:52.700 --> 02:16:57.700
I mean, I get it, the game truck thing and stuff, but who would want to watch you play Zelda?

02:16:58.700 --> 02:16:59.700
It's a one player game.

02:17:00.700 --> 02:17:08.700
Like, I get mobile, I get some land stuff going on there and Mario Kart would be a good choice for that, but it's like, I'm playing Zelda. Wow, that's cool.

02:17:09.700 --> 02:17:14.700
Isn't that what Twitch lets me do? Like, whoa, I'm playing Zelda, other people can watch me. That's Twitch.

02:17:15.700 --> 02:17:22.700
I mean, shit, even the PlayStation 4 SharePlay, if I don't want to be public about it, because Twitch is very public, right?

02:17:22.700 --> 02:17:36.700
But I've done that where I play on SharePlay on PlayStation 4, so it's private, so that I'm not actually streaming online, I'm just streaming for somebody who, you know, wanted to see the game that can ask specific questions or whatever.

02:17:37.700 --> 02:17:48.700
That's a very, uh, I mean, it's like, it's just like a, I don't know, camper show, like a, not a mobile home, but like a camper that they have games inside.

02:17:49.700 --> 02:17:56.700
It's a very small room, they have like this stupid video on their website where all the kids are, like, cheering, the truck's coming down the street, I'm like, no, no they're not. No, they're not doing that.

02:17:58.700 --> 02:18:03.700
Um, but like, they're all playing, let's see what games are they playing, they're playing Halo, they're playing fucking Halo.

02:18:03.700 --> 02:18:06.700
They should have had those pictures of Donald Trump driving the truck.

02:18:06.700 --> 02:18:09.700
They're playing, they're playing, they have eight player land Halo going on.

02:18:09.700 --> 02:18:11.700
Okay, that's kind of cool though.

02:18:11.700 --> 02:18:19.700
Yeah, and see, a mature rated game, by the way, nobody gives a shit about the fucking rated, you know, M rated games.

02:18:20.700 --> 02:18:30.700
We had a conversation about this with some of the parents, because they were talking about like, you know, oh my god, that game has sexuality, that game doesn't have sex in it, because my son plays Call of Duty and like that stuff, you know.

02:18:30.700 --> 02:18:32.700
No, just blowing people's faces off the guns, that's all.

02:18:32.700 --> 02:18:37.700
Yeah, I'm like, yeah, you find people, you know, blowing heads off, but you're not finding sex, yeah, that's right.

02:18:37.700 --> 02:18:44.700
Don't show them that scene from Mass Effect Andromeda, because I'm telling you, titty, Loki, there's full on titty in that game.

02:18:46.700 --> 02:18:47.700
Uh, yeah.

02:18:47.700 --> 02:18:48.700
Yeah.

02:18:50.700 --> 02:18:53.700
Alright, should we open up Skype line? Want to open that up?

02:18:53.700 --> 02:18:54.700
Let's do it.

02:18:54.700 --> 02:18:58.700
Let's do it. Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype, if you want to give us a call.

02:18:58.700 --> 02:19:02.700
Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype, if you'd like to give us a call.

02:19:02.700 --> 02:19:07.700
We'll talk about whatever, or maybe we missed something that you want to talk about tonight, we can certainly do that.

02:19:07.700 --> 02:19:09.700
If you want to do it the old fashioned way, you can do it that way too.

02:19:09.700 --> 02:19:13.700
Actually, no you can't, because we got a call coming in right now, so let's get to it.

02:19:13.700 --> 02:19:15.700
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

02:19:15.700 --> 02:19:17.700
Hey, hey, it's...

02:19:17.700 --> 02:19:21.700
Hey, you're cutting up a little bit there, but I think it's Rama, right Rama?

02:19:21.700 --> 02:19:27.700
Yeah, I just had to finish doing a bunch of rebuilding on my machine, so it's a little temperamental right now.

02:19:27.700 --> 02:19:29.700
Yeah, I'm getting that echo thing too, but what's on your mind?

02:19:29.700 --> 02:19:38.700
Well, two things. Earlier in tonight's broadcast, you talked about people being gay and lesbian, and my thing is this, I don't care what you are.

02:19:38.700 --> 02:19:41.700
Are we still going to the bar later? Yes or no?

02:19:41.700 --> 02:19:43.700
Perfect, I'm fine with that.

02:19:43.700 --> 02:19:51.700
Exactly. Do whatever you want to do to make sure you're... as long as you're happy, fuck it. I don't care.

02:19:51.700 --> 02:19:55.700
As long as we can still chill, hang out, have a good time, that's all that matters.

02:19:55.700 --> 02:19:58.700
Thank you very much. That and equal tax laws, that's all we have.

02:19:59.700 --> 02:20:05.700
And secondly, the whole JonTron thing, I'm just going to put it like this.

02:20:05.700 --> 02:20:19.700
When you are that type of person where you do camming, web shows, podcasting, you should not use that platform for your own political thoughts and views.

02:20:19.700 --> 02:20:29.700
It's one thing to tell your listeners to fight for what you believe in, as opposed to saying, well, my views is dah, dah, dah, dah. That's the way it should be.

02:20:29.700 --> 02:20:38.700
And if you know you have controversial views after throwing it out there the first time, maybe you should just kind of like keep that shit to yourself.

02:20:41.700 --> 02:20:44.700
Well, it's complicated.

02:20:44.700 --> 02:20:45.700
It's complicated.

02:20:45.700 --> 02:20:46.700
Oh, I know. I know.

02:20:46.700 --> 02:20:55.700
Because we sometimes say political things on this show. But as I mentioned a minute ago, I haven't made a dime off this show in 15 years.

02:20:56.700 --> 02:21:12.700
Yeah, but Rob, the difference is what you've said on here isn't really political. It's like, it is, but at the same time, you say it in an aspect of, you know, what is wrong in this world, what we have to do, as opposed to going against the grain. You see what I'm saying?

02:21:12.700 --> 02:21:18.700
No, I do. I do. And I would never, I would never encourage hateful rhetoric. Ever.

02:21:19.700 --> 02:21:20.700
Exactly.

02:21:21.700 --> 02:21:27.700
Anyway, I'm hearing myself through your speakers, so I have to wrap up a little bit. But any other last thoughts for us, Rama?

02:21:28.700 --> 02:21:33.700
No last thoughts. I will be up for a while putting my machine back together.

02:21:33.700 --> 02:21:34.700
Alright, have fun.

02:21:34.700 --> 02:21:35.700
Have fun.

02:21:35.700 --> 02:21:36.700
You too.

02:21:36.700 --> 02:21:37.700
We'll talk to you on Tuesday. Bye.

02:21:37.700 --> 02:21:38.700
Bye.

02:21:38.700 --> 02:21:54.700
Anime Jam Session, of course, Tuesday nights here at the Voice Geeks Network, vog.network.com. Sorry, I hate cutting Rama short, but could you guys hear it too? I mean, I know you can hear it in the studio, you can hear myself coming back through, right? I don't know if that carried over over the air, but that was a lot going on there. Let's get to another call. Hi, you're on Orange Lawn's Radio, who's this?

02:21:56.700 --> 02:21:58.700
Hi, can you hear me?

02:21:58.700 --> 02:22:00.700
Hi, hello, you're on Orange Lawn's Radio, who's this?

02:22:00.700 --> 02:22:02.700
Hi, this is Elliot B.

02:22:02.700 --> 02:22:04.700
Hi, Elliot B. Wow, aren't you on the other side of the pond?

02:22:04.700 --> 02:22:07.700
Not any longer, I actually moved to New York last year.

02:22:07.700 --> 02:22:14.700
Oh, well, welcome, I suppose, even though I'm a year late, but what's on your mind? What's on your mind tonight?

02:22:14.700 --> 02:22:31.700
Well, I was lucky enough to pick up a Nintendo Switch on Tuesday. I went by the Nintendo store at lunchtime, because I work in Midtown Manhattan, and they said, oh, we don't have any in stock at the moment, but if you subscribe to, you know, if you follow us on Twitter.

02:22:32.700 --> 02:22:43.700
So I turned on Twitter notifications on my phone, and they happened to, and then 15 minutes later, they tweeted, oh, we've got some, we're going to have some in stock at three o'clock in the afternoon.

02:22:45.700 --> 02:22:54.700
And that was at 2.30, I think. So I rushed out my office and got in line. There was about 20 people ahead of me already by that point.

02:22:56.700 --> 02:23:00.700
And yeah, I got one, so I've been playing tons and tons of Zelda.

02:23:00.700 --> 02:23:13.700
Congratulations. That's kind of a miracle that you happen to be in the right place and see that tweet and everything. That's everything lining up perfectly. That says a lot to the 20 people were still there ahead of you.

02:23:13.700 --> 02:23:18.700
My question is, how many of those 20 people were scalpers? Dirty, filthy scalpers?

02:23:19.700 --> 02:23:31.700
That's a good question. I don't know. I was only speaking to the people. There were a couple of people in front of me that was like a 15-year-old kid with his dad. I don't know how they both managed to get there, you know, with 10 minutes.

02:23:32.700 --> 02:23:41.700
But yeah, it seemed like genuine fans in the queue. It didn't seem like, in the line, sorry, I'm still learning American English.

02:23:41.700 --> 02:23:48.700
That's okay. We can figure some of the things out. We know a lift. We know a lift is an elevator. You know, same thing. We figured it out.

02:23:49.700 --> 02:23:51.700
It's also not a taxi here.

02:23:52.700 --> 02:23:53.700
It's not a what?

02:23:53.700 --> 02:23:54.700
A lift.

02:23:54.700 --> 02:24:08.700
Oh, I see what you did. Sorry, that was a little too complex for even me. I'm a big stupid American. I don't understand. Anyway, so you've been playing Zelda on the Switch and it sounds like you're having a good time?

02:24:08.700 --> 02:24:21.700
Yes. I just beat the first Divine Beast today. And yeah, I'm sort of like, I beat that bit and then I'm used to kind of pass those. They're like, okay, now go on to the desert or something.

02:24:22.700 --> 02:24:30.700
And now they're like, yeah, you've got this huge entire map that you can now explore. It's kind of overwhelming. But no, I'm loving the game.

02:24:31.700 --> 02:24:35.700
I was thinking, do you remember when the first trailers came out for Twilight Princess?

02:24:36.700 --> 02:24:37.700
Yes.

02:24:37.700 --> 02:24:42.700
The Zelda that I was imagining from that trailer, this feels like that game finally, like a decade later.

02:24:43.700 --> 02:24:54.700
A decade late. But no, I mean, just the openness of it. I mean, even Twilight Princess. I mean, I still enjoy Twilight Princess for what it is. But you were still in these narrow areas where your exploration was very limited.

02:24:55.700 --> 02:25:06.700
Or at least in Heinz. I mean, I don't know, it didn't feel so limiting at the time. It just kind of felt like the way games were. But now in retrospect, hell yeah, those games feel so limiting compared to how open Breath of the Wild is, you know?

02:25:07.700 --> 02:25:09.700
Oh, yeah, yeah.

02:25:10.700 --> 02:25:17.700
Let me ask you this. Are you playing anything besides Zelda on the Switch? Because we know everybody with the Switch is probably playing Zelda, but have you checked anything else out?

02:25:18.700 --> 02:25:26.700
Not really. I downloaded the... there's a demo. The only demo on the store is for that game. It's a co-op game where you have to cut each other out.

02:25:27.700 --> 02:25:28.700
Oh, the Snipperclips?

02:25:29.700 --> 02:25:33.700
Snipperclips, yeah. Which I quite like the demo to. It's kind of hilarious. Have you played it?

02:25:33.700 --> 02:25:44.700
I actually have a little bit. A friend of ours had it and brought it over. We were playing for... I was watching him and Alan play. I didn't get to play a lot, but I did play a little bit of it.

02:25:45.700 --> 02:25:52.700
It's definitely because it's a puzzle game, you have to kind of communicate. But I was getting really frustrated at one of the puzzles because I'm like, this is too hard.

02:25:53.700 --> 02:26:02.700
Yeah, my girlfriend and I were playing the demo and I was getting so frustrated with her that I thought if I actually dropped the $20 on the real game, it might lead to some sort of breakup.

02:26:03.700 --> 02:26:05.700
That's not good.

02:26:06.700 --> 02:26:21.700
Not to throw shade on her gaming abilities or anything, but yes. It requires a lot of cooperation and a lot of trying to explain. Yeah, if you cut me in kind of exactly that exact shape, yeah, like more of a curve sort of thing.

02:26:22.700 --> 02:26:29.700
Well, don't get Mario Kart or Mario Party either because those games can also end relationships, so be careful. Be careful.

02:26:29.700 --> 02:26:35.700
Well, that probably is the next game I'm going to get, Mario Kart. I'm looking forward to that one. I need a good multiplayer game for this system.

02:26:36.700 --> 02:26:49.700
I'm looking forward definitely to the multiplayer capabilities when you're in one room. I don't know if you do the conventions and all that stuff or just meetups with other gamers, but I think something like Mario Party is really going to kick ass in that sort of setting.

02:26:50.700 --> 02:26:55.700
I just love the idea of carrying it somewhere and breaking out the Joy-Cons and passing them around.

02:26:55.700 --> 02:27:07.700
Yeah, for sure, for sure. Alright, well congratulations on getting a Switch and getting down there to the store with, oh gosh, in 20 minutes. That's amazing that you were able to get over there so fast and end up getting a Switch.

02:27:08.700 --> 02:27:13.700
Well, hopefully more will become available, as Loki was saying earlier, but there's still a scarcity right now.

02:27:14.700 --> 02:27:16.700
It's amazing. They're out of stock in about half an hour.

02:27:17.700 --> 02:27:22.700
Oh my gosh, wow, wow. Well, that's better than NES Classic Mini.

02:27:22.700 --> 02:27:24.700
Whatever happened to that?

02:27:25.700 --> 02:27:27.700
Oh, I'm sure they have one monkey working on that now.

02:27:28.700 --> 02:27:35.700
I don't know about that. I think they're trying to get us to forget about that system even though it was like the biggest thing at Christmas, but whatever, whatever.

02:27:36.700 --> 02:27:39.700
Alright, well, Elliot, thanks for the call and good to hear from you.

02:27:40.700 --> 02:27:41.700
Yeah, cool.

02:27:42.700 --> 02:27:43.700
Keep enjoying the Switch. Alright, take care.

02:27:44.700 --> 02:27:45.700
Bye.

02:27:45.700 --> 02:27:56.700
Bye-bye. Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype if you want to give us a call. Loki, I'll check in with you once again here before we close up the Skype line. See if you have any other stories you want to get out here.

02:27:57.700 --> 02:28:00.700
Uh, no. I think we covered pretty much everything.

02:28:01.700 --> 02:28:02.700
What?

02:28:02.700 --> 02:28:20.700
Well, there's one article that's about Nintendo not necessarily going towards microtransactions in their mobile platforms, so they're saying, you know, I guess the Super Mario Run did not meet their expectations in terms of actually making money, even though it was downloaded 78 million times.

02:28:21.700 --> 02:28:23.700
And they just released it on Android this week too, which is kind of a big deal, right?

02:28:23.700 --> 02:28:34.700
They said that, um, they said that about 4 of the 78 million people, or, you know, 4 million of those, did buy the game, which is about 5%.

02:28:35.700 --> 02:28:43.700
So they made $40 million. Well, no, because the store, okay, because Apple and so forth get a cut of, what, about 30%, right? So they made...

02:28:44.700 --> 02:28:46.700
Like 20-some-odd million dollars on it?

02:28:47.700 --> 02:28:54.700
Yeah, okay. Let's say we'll say half the money, because marketing, etc. I mean, they probably made more than 20 million, but still, we'll say that.

02:28:55.700 --> 02:28:58.700
For an Android game. I think that's pretty damn good.

02:28:59.700 --> 02:29:03.700
Interesting. Well, maybe they learned some things in the whole experience, though.

02:29:04.700 --> 02:29:10.700
Well, in the figure, I mean, the Android version just came out, so, I mean, that was only a small portion of the marketplace out there.

02:29:11.700 --> 02:29:16.700
They did wait an awful long time to put that on Android. I don't know if they had some sort of deal with Apple where they couldn't.

02:29:17.700 --> 02:29:22.700
Well, remember, they were, I thought they were worried about the whole, like, copy protection garbage or something.

02:29:23.700 --> 02:29:25.700
I don't know, that's a weird thing to worry about, but whatever.

02:29:26.700 --> 02:29:29.700
Yeah, they were worried about piracy on the Android. That's what they were worried about.

02:29:30.700 --> 02:29:36.700
But, I mean, but that didn't stop them with, what, Fire Emblem? Although, Fire Emblem, like, consistently talks to the, well, so does Super Mario Run.

02:29:36.700 --> 02:29:38.700
Does it say Fire Emblem has to continuously talk to the only server?

02:29:39.700 --> 02:29:44.700
Yeah, it does, it does, because my son's in the middle of a level, and I had to reset the router, and he's like, Dad, it stopped working!

02:29:45.700 --> 02:29:46.700
Oh, no.

02:29:47.700 --> 02:29:48.700
Which is stupid, yes, it is absolutely stupid.

02:29:49.700 --> 02:29:50.700
You kicked your son off the game, you're so cruel.

02:29:51.700 --> 02:29:52.700
I know. It's so terrible.

02:29:53.700 --> 02:29:55.700
One more shout-out for calls, and then we'll close up the Skype line.

02:29:56.700 --> 02:29:59.700
Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype, if you want to give us a call.

02:29:59.700 --> 02:30:11.700
Rama and Chad Agreen, they should have gone to Android first, bigger install base. I don't necessarily agree they needed to go to either one first, just don't make it, like, how many months has it been since it came out on my phone?

02:30:12.700 --> 02:30:28.700
Well, they're saying that even though, even the whole thing, the point was, though, even though they didn't make as much as they had thought they would on Super Mario Run, and even though Fire Emblem Heroes is doing pretty good, even with the microtransactions, they said they still want to stick with that kind of, you know, one price point.

02:30:29.700 --> 02:30:34.700
Format that they don't sell the microtransactions. I think it's because they're kind of used to that.

02:30:35.700 --> 02:30:39.700
Which is good. Any company that gets out of microtransactions is a good thing, I think.

02:30:40.700 --> 02:30:45.700
Alright. Well, I guess nobody else is calling us, Loki. I think that's going to wrap it up for the Skype line.

02:30:46.700 --> 02:30:52.700
But if you were just being shy, you can always email us as well. Participate at OrangeLoungeTrader.com if you'd like to send us an email.

02:30:53.700 --> 02:31:04.700
Otherwise, I think that's probably going to do it for tonight's OLR. Not bad for having, you know, no production really going into tonight's episode, but luckily we had a game we ran about for a little while at the top of the show there.

02:31:05.700 --> 02:31:15.700
Hopefully Dark Soccer is feeling better, and we'll be back next week. We're also going to be joined, as mentioned, next week by SacIGDA in preparation for the Sac Indie Arcade event.

02:31:15.700 --> 02:31:25.700
I do want to remind people there will be no show that Sunday, so April 9th, there will not be an OLR because April 8th, we will have been broadcasting all day long.

02:31:26.700 --> 02:31:32.700
There's so much going on on that weekend. I have not just one now, but two people coming in from out of town.

02:31:33.700 --> 02:31:40.700
So I have plans. I know I have a rough life, right? But I have plans Friday night, I have plans all day Saturday, and now I have plans Sunday night when we would usually be doing OLR.

02:31:40.700 --> 02:31:44.700
It's just like when it rains, it pours. But I'm looking forward to that weekend. It'll be a lot of fun.

02:31:45.700 --> 02:31:53.700
It will be. It will. So looking forward to broadcasting from the Sac Indie Arcade event. We'll talk to Gabe about that next week, and hopefully Brie will be here too, whoever else might be coming from the event.

02:31:54.700 --> 02:32:07.700
And then we'll be doing that on Saturday. I'm hoping maybe we can wrap all the post-production of that up real fast so that maybe Sunday night instead of OLR, if you miss the broadcast on Saturday.

02:32:07.700 --> 02:32:15.700
I'm not going to promise this yet until I know I can turn it around fast, but maybe we can re-run it on into Sunday night when OLR would usually be on.

02:32:16.700 --> 02:32:23.700
That's what I'm going to try to aim for. Even though it is quote-unquote all day, it really only ends up being like five hours maybe.

02:32:23.700 --> 02:32:34.700
I think that's going to do it. Let's go around and get final thoughts. Oh, I do have to give a quick shout out as always.

02:32:35.700 --> 02:32:41.700
If you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Launch Radio, please tell a friend or two about the show. Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice.

02:32:42.700 --> 02:32:51.700
But not if the voices ain't here. So a nice five-star review on a place like iTunes or Google or wherever it is you found this show, that all goes an awful long way as well.

02:32:51.700 --> 02:32:56.700
So we really appreciate all of that. Otherwise, do we have any final thoughts from Loki tonight?

02:32:57.700 --> 02:33:14.700
I ordered some filament in preparation for my printer to be shipped at some point. But I ordered orange filament and purple filament. So maybe I'll make something related to one of the shows.

02:33:15.700 --> 02:33:16.700
Why not?

02:33:17.700 --> 02:33:18.700
That's why I ordered the printer though.

02:33:18.700 --> 02:33:22.700
Yeah, start cranking out some stuff I can give away at DragonCon this year. You're a factory now.

02:33:23.700 --> 02:33:24.700
A factory.

02:33:25.700 --> 02:33:38.700
That's it. My final thought tonight is I'm looking forward to enjoying more Mass Effect because yes, overall I am enjoying it and trying to get better at multiplayer because right now it's pretty hideous, you guys.

02:33:38.700 --> 02:33:50.700
It's pretty hideous. We'll see you in seven days to do it all over again. But until then, have a great week everybody. We'll see you next time here on Orange Lounge Radio. Thanks again for tuning in and staying with us. Good night.
