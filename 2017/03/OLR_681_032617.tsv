0	18120	This week Good Ol' Games continues its improvements by providing universal cloud save support
18120	21280	to every game they sell without the games needing updates to support it.
21280	24560	This is just one bonus to delight gamers and we have much more to tell you about starting
24560	28480	right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.
28480	35000	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show
35000	36680	where every gamer has a voice.
36680	43560	It is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight with episode number 681 for this March 26th of
43560	45080	2017.
45080	51460	My name is Rob Roberts joining you every week here at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com
51460	55420	Sunday nights at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf
55420	61540	show and if you are listening live you can join us in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.
61540	64620	Just a quick note for the live listeners, our website has been acting a little funky
64620	67060	today because they've been doing some maintenance.
67060	70700	So I've been trying to make the show live so y'all can check in because if you didn't
70700	74300	know you can do that, you can actually check in over at vognetwork.com and you get points
74300	79300	for listening to the show and same thing on the podcast if you're not able to be here
79300	82660	live because you got something else going on Sunday nights, you can listen on the podcast
82660	85980	feed, there will be a little interruption somewhere in the show and then Jason comes
85980	90020	on and says to register participation use this pass phrase and he'll tell you what
90020	93180	it is and you just go type it at the main page of vognetwork.com and you get the same
93180	97220	check in all the live people get, same same, so don't say we don't love you podcasters
97220	102260	but the website's acting funky, I can't turn it live although it just came up as
102260	105400	I've been ranting here so maybe it was just one of those little hiccups while they've
105400	106660	been doing maintenance.
106660	111260	So while I mess with that, I should turn over here to my right and introduce Techmaster
111260	112900	Loki joining me in the studio.
112900	113900	Hello.
113900	114900	Hi Loki, how are you?
114900	115900	I have food in my mouth.
115900	116900	Yeah, great, great.
116900	118940	So we got all these radio problems going on, we got a busted website.
118940	119940	That's alright.
119940	120940	You're trying to talk with your mouth full.
120940	121940	Well, how are you, Loki?
121940	122940	I'm doing fine.
122940	124340	So you were telling me about a trip to the movies?
124340	128380	Yeah, I went and saw Lego Batman yesterday because I wanted to take my son to go see
128380	132340	it because my wife doesn't want to go see it and he always likes to go in the movie
132340	133340	for years.
133340	134340	So we went and saw that yesterday.
135020	140460	And it was fucking awesome because it's the Lego movies and the Lego movies are just fantastic.
140460	145900	It was kind of cool about Lego Batman though, minor spoilers I guess.
145900	150540	There's a lot of different villains from different movie series that come out in this
150540	155080	because they go to the Phantom Zone and pull all these bad guys.
155080	161100	So it feels a lot like Lego Dimensions the movie if they were going to do that.
161180	165140	Mine is, of course, you know, Wild Cell and Gandalf and all that shit that are normally
165140	167060	in the Lego Dimensions game.
167060	169380	But they've got a lot of humor in it.
169380	173400	It's just really funny, especially if you've watched all the other Batman movies because
173400	178180	they make lots of references to stuff that happened in those and it was pretty awesome.
178180	180980	That's funny that you went to the movies because you guys know, and I talk about this on the
180980	182720	show, I never get to movies anymore, right?
182720	185640	So I did get dragged to the movies this weekend.
185640	190580	So my buddy, Shane, who comes on this show a lot and hosts another show here on the network,
190580	195340	Power Ranger Pridecast, obviously he's very hyped about the Power Rangers movie.
195340	197160	So he dragged me to go see that.
197160	200560	In the fancy new theaters in Sacramento, and if you happen to be a local person, you know
200560	204420	exactly which theaters I'm talking about, they tore down what we used to call the boobies
204420	207420	because there were these big dome theaters that you could see from miles away and they
207420	208420	were the boobies, right?
208420	215340	So they tore down the boobies, they're gone, and then they put this large, very, it's just
215340	218540	a very rectangular plane building now, it's not as exciting.
218540	223760	But inside, it's super exciting because it has like the recliner seats that full recline,
223760	227320	like I'm talking like Lazy Boys where you put your feet up and all this stuff, which
227320	229360	I guess is the new trend in movies.
229360	234260	You guys have this in your areas, where you can literally put your feet up and lean back
234260	237260	and all this, or is this just like a local thing that's starting to spread?
237260	241060	I imagine the Bay Area had to probably get it first.
241060	242580	Usually they do.
242580	247660	But yeah, so I went and saw Power Rangers in the fancy theater and I liked it.
247660	252580	I know the critics are kind of saying it's kind of a mess, but I liked it well enough.
252580	258740	It had issues, but I don't like super get into the show, obviously the same way Shane
258740	260220	does, but I'm not a hater either.
260220	262100	I'm just like, okay, cool, Power Rangers.
262100	266700	I actually think the best way Shane ever kind of like, not that anyone should have to justify
266700	270600	their fandom, but you know, Power Rangers sometimes get seen as more of a kid's show
270600	273580	because it's like what, the Saturday morning show or something, right?
273580	277180	But I think the best way he ever justified it in that way and kind of made me go, oh,
277620	281500	was when he said, well, people get super into Marvel movies and Marvel heroes.
281500	284220	So if these are the heroes you're into, what's the difference?
284220	286140	And I was like, all right, fair.
286140	287140	You made a good point.
287140	292260	So I went and saw the Power Rangers just kind of approaching it as a Marvel movie because
292260	294340	that's clearly what they wanted it to be.
294340	295860	They're clearly trying to make a Marvel franchise.
295860	298500	Everybody's trying to make a Marvel franchise now, right?
298500	301980	So I saw it and I didn't think it was that bad.
301980	308540	I felt that like one character was way better developed than the other four, but I'm not
308540	311100	going to be spoilery, but I just, it was very obvious.
311100	315580	Like one character was like really, really well developed and like, you know, the audience
315580	319160	really like sympathizes with this person who gets into it and all this stuff.
319160	322520	And then the other four are just kind of like, oh yeah, here's our little one note things
322520	324740	that make us unique and that whole thing.
324740	328420	So and I liked Rita Repulsa.
328420	333120	I like Elizabeth Banks as Rita Repulsa, even though it's like totally not the campy version
333120	334340	from the nineties TV show.
334340	338140	Cause I do remember that I've seen enough of the show to know that, uh, totally different.
338140	341620	But like, I like seeing Elizabeth banks in a different role and I think she kind of knew
341620	343260	what movie she was in.
343260	346480	Like, you know, she, she knew what it was, so she had fun with it.
346480	350960	So look, I know it's, I know it's not a movie podcast, it's a video game podcast, but it's
350960	354100	inevitable that the two worlds collide once in a while.
354100	355100	Right?
355100	356100	Yeah, exactly.
356300	360780	So you might be wondering why I have not introduced yet tonight, Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers.
360780	363280	Sadly, she is not here on tonight's show.
363280	366620	And I know she's very frustrated because she wants to be here with you guys and she will
366620	369300	join us on the Skype line a little later.
369300	371460	But I asked her, I asked her if I could tell you guys what's going on.
371460	375500	She said I could, so I'm not telling you all her business without getting permission first.
375500	377980	But she ended up in the hospital this week.
377980	382020	She had kidney stone, which if any y'all have ever gone through that, you know, they're
382020	383340	no fun at all.
383340	388420	My understanding is it was not large enough to qualify for the little sound thingy that
388420	389560	they usually do.
389560	393200	So she is currently waiting for nature to take its course.
393200	395680	And so she obviously didn't want to do that here.
395680	397200	So fair enough.
397200	401860	So anyway, we send Get Well vibes to Dark Sakura, who I think has been dealing with
401860	404760	a multitude of afflictions since the beginning of the year.
404760	409640	So I want to put that poor girl in the bubble when she's better.
409640	411940	Stay safe, Dark Sakura 2017.
411940	415020	So anyway, we will hear from her a little later in the show.
415020	416580	She's going to call in.
416580	419980	And if she happens to be listening, there's a lot of folks in chat that are sending their
419980	421480	well wishes.
421480	425900	Because again, we do tape live and you can join us at live.vognetwork.com, which Stapi
425900	426900	says that sucks.
426900	430340	And come on, Noel Gus says, oh, no, that sucks, poor Dark Sakura.
430340	433580	And on Mass Effect week two, right, right?
433580	438100	That's what I was hoping to get into at the top of the show this week, was talking a little
438100	440180	bit about the Mass Effect Andromeda launch.
440820	442700	So here's the other funny thing going on this week.
442700	447180	I mean, I don't know if it's the Mass Effect launch to blame for this or what's going on,
447180	449180	but like everything's broken, you guys.
449180	453740	So since we're doing that maintenance, right, over at vognetwork.com, that kind of kept
453740	458940	the website going up and down at the time that I usually go in to produce an episode
458940	459940	of the show.
459940	463680	We don't script the show, obviously, but we do like to have a nice little outline that
463680	466860	says Loki's going to talk about this, then Jamie's going to talk about this.
466860	470140	We like to have a nice little outline so we don't step on each other's feet and, you know,
470140	473660	talk about things twice and so forth, so there's a little order to the show.
473660	477060	Yeah, couldn't do that tonight because of the maintenance.
477060	481420	Oops, I didn't, and they told us about the maintenance on Thursday, but I wasn't thinking
481420	485100	at that time, oh, Rob, you're going to need to get in the website then so you can produce
485100	486100	the night show.
486100	489740	I'm just thinking, oh, good, it'll be done by five o'clock when Bobby's live and when
489740	493020	we're live and so it won't really affect the listeners or whatever.
493020	497820	So I don't know what we're going to talk about tonight.
497820	503860	He's put some things together for us, though, and I've agreed to just shut up and comment
503860	508380	tonight so that I'm not stealing stories from Loki and, you know, he can talk about whatever
508380	512620	he wants, but if we did a kickoff topic tonight, I probably would have wanted to talk about
512620	516900	Mass Effect Andromeda, but unfortunately, Dark Sakura's not here, but obviously that
516900	521500	was a big release that has a lot of people's attention, although, Loki, you don't, I know
521500	524860	you, you're not super into Mass Effect, but has anything about Andromeda kind of caught
524860	525860	your eye?
525860	529660	Well, I watched a 20 minute video of all the features.
529660	532180	When you say features, you mean bugs, right?
532180	536620	Well, it wasn't, some of it's bugs and some of it's just like story stuff that just doesn't
536620	541820	make any sense and like, don't get me wrong, I mean, I've been playing a ton of Skyrim,
541820	551380	so I'm well aware of bugs in games and stuff, but it's kind of like, you know, harming the
551380	555060	series, I think, you know, the fact that this is the quality that's coming out and you kind
555060	559220	of wonder, like, and I know there's been a lot of people, you know, developers and animators
559220	562660	and stuff that have come out in defense of it, it's like, the animation's hard.
562660	568900	I get that, but why wasn't it hard for three, two, and one, you know, and now all of a sudden
568900	570300	it's really hard.
570300	573580	It's just like, especially when you look at like the previous game, it's like, holy shit,
573580	580980	you know, there's been a very severe downgrade in the quality of, you know, even the facial
580980	586620	appearance and everything versus like the other games, but I don't know, some of the
586620	590380	like story stuff didn't seem to make any sense, like the reactions were just like kind of,
590380	593060	like they dial, phoned it in, I guess.
593060	597340	Here's the thing, I agree with you and I don't, like, now that I've spent, and I've spent
597340	601220	a good, like, I think I've spent 20 hours, I think is what the clock is up to, and I'm
601220	606180	only like 23% or something all the way through the game, like, I've probably barely scratched
606180	609500	the surface on this, and that's not even counting multiplayer, that's just my single player
609500	610500	file.
611020	614260	That's not even counting, I've probably spent easy another four hours on multiplayer so
614260	617060	far, but anyway, I agree and I don't agree.
617060	621300	I think at the end of the day for me, Mass Effect, and you guys know I'm a fan of the
621300	625620	series and have been very vocal of how much I enjoy this series, so if you want to claim
625620	629740	that my opinion is biased, I'm using my quotey fingers, then fine.
629740	632860	But I can also recognize that this game is not a 10 out of 10.
632860	636260	This, Mass Effect Andromeda is not going to be a 10 out of 10.
636300	640740	I don't think, though, it's 7.5 or whatever Metacritic's saying out of 10 either.
640740	644460	We talked about the whole critic thing last week, I'm not going to double-talk that too
644460	650500	much, but I think the internet is giving this a little bit too much shit unnecessarily.
650500	656860	Yes, there are bugs in the game, clearly well-documented by some of these gifs and YouTubes and things,
656860	661140	but like you said, there's a lot of games out there that have bugs in them when they
661140	664540	come out and then we hail them as game of the year, Skyrim.
664540	668660	Not that I'm excusing the bugs and all that, it's an issue, and it's one of Mass Effect
668660	674020	Andromeda's biggest issues, and what I feel is keeping Mass Effect Andromeda from being
674020	679260	a 10 out of 10 game, whereas Zelda Breath of the Wild is a 10 out of 10 game.
679260	686740	Yeah, and I think it comes to fandom again, that 10 out of 10 for Zelda, I think a lot
686740	692260	of these reviews overlooked those bugs, whereas in Mass Effect, they definitely paid attention
692260	693260	to the bugs.
693260	698180	Yes, yes, thank you for saying that, because I absolutely believe some of that is coming
698180	699180	into play.
699180	704180	And I don't want to turn to the darker things on the internet, and the whole social justice
704180	706540	warrior versus Twitter and all this-
706540	708580	I don't understand that complaint at all.
708580	712060	I don't, like, fucking quit it!
712060	718900	I'm not even going to say much more than that, my eyes roll to the back of my head so far
718900	719900	I can see my brain.
719900	722020	What was the complaint about it, was it that they're saying that because the social justice
722020	725580	warriors were involved in it, that's why the facial animations were terrible, or are
725580	727860	they talking about being able to romance people of different genders?
727860	732060	I'm not even fucking sure, something about Bioware needing to pander to-
732060	738100	Oh, I remember the stupid argument, they wanted to make the characters uglier because apparently
738100	742220	social justice warriors are uglier or something, and so it's the pander-
742220	743220	What?!
743220	747580	I don't know, the whole argument was very stupid, so I was just like, whatever, I don't
747580	749140	understand what the point of this is, but-
749140	755140	I fucking can't, and I know it's a radio show, but I am using my hand to throw that out of
755140	758460	the ballpark because I don't give a fuck about all of that.
758460	762060	I don't understand what they were trying to accomplish with the argument, and I don't
762060	766780	understand how social justice warriors even come into play at all with this, but whatever.
766780	770260	I'm gonna tell you what it is, I'm gonna tell you what it is with the whole animations and
770260	771260	all of it.
771260	776600	And again, why Zelda is a 10 out of 10 game, and why Mass Effect Andromeda is not, okay?
776600	781740	The reason is, Mass Effect Andromeda should have been delayed, again.
781740	786360	And I know, out of a 5 year development cycle, and right at the end of the fiscal year, that's
786360	789680	the last thing you want to hear a fan of the series who's been very adamant about waiting
789680	792760	for this game a long time to say, but that's the reality.
792760	797920	Because when they delayed Zelda, ain't nobody noting now that Zelda should have been a holiday
797920	804760	2016 game, because everybody's losing their shit over it, because it's really good, and
805040	810560	what draws a lot of people into Zelda are those little intricacies, right?
810560	816560	That cute little fucking dog that chases its tail, the fact that when you walk towards
816560	821000	the edge of a bridge, the guardsmen will say, no, don't do it, don't jump.
821000	825140	Like those little intricacies in the animations and things like that, that could only be done
825140	831020	because Zelda had time to cook in the oven until it was absolutely finished.
831140	836980	Mass Effect Andromeda did not, and that is what's very clear about this game.
836980	843980	Because as I'm playing it, I'm going, did anyone at BioWare play this game from start
844820	846380	to finish?
846380	850660	Because a lot of these issues would have been very obvious, and I'm actually not even talking
850660	855700	about the animations and that stuff, I'm gonna be honest, that stuff honestly doesn't bother
855700	859740	me the way it seems to be bothering a lot of people, because I don't really notice it.
859780	864860	I'm not fixating in on five seconds that went wrong out of 20 hours that I've been playing.
864860	868980	Yes, I noticed in one scene my character was floating when he shouldn't have been.
868980	871100	That was really weird, okay?
871100	875580	But okay, it happened one time out of 20 hours, and I kind of just forgot about it and I moved
875580	876540	on.
876540	882180	But there's other weird shit that happens too, like for example, and I'm gonna choose
882180	886880	my words very carefully here because I'm trying to stay spoiler free, but in the beginning
886920	892160	of the game you go to a planet, and you might stay on that planet for a while and then obviously
892160	896040	the story is gonna take you to another planet, that's what you expect in a sci-fi game, right?
896040	902720	Well you can go back to this planet and continue to do work on this planet to go even further.
902720	908400	Well at one point I did that, I went back to that planet and I did like just about everything
908400	913160	you could do on that planet, or at least when the game gave me a trophy for doing enough
913160	914160	on that planet.
914160	915160	Wink, nudge.
915360	918760	I'm trying to stay very spoiler free.
918760	922120	So then when I go to this other planet I then progress the story and I'm doing all this
922120	925560	stuff and then my crew members go, hey, did you hear?
925560	930320	The base over at the one planet had the problems fixed with the radiation, we should go back
930320	931560	and see what's going on.
931560	935200	And I'm like, I fucking did that two hours ago, like why are you just now having this
935200	936200	conversation?
936200	940280	Okay, let me bring this back to Skyrim.
940360	945440	I heard they're reforming the Dawnguard, you know, some sort of vampire hunters or something.
945440	949160	My god, every, you think Arrow to the Knee is fucking annoying?
949160	957280	After that fucking DLC update, every fucking guard has to tell me about the fucking Dawnguard.
957280	962320	It's like, yes, I'm fucking aware of this stupid castle that, you know, these group
962320	966240	of people that fight vampires, it's like fucking shut up about it.
966240	968360	And Shane was telling me he had a weird issue too.
968360	974200	Like he had something where he went to the planet, the very first planet, and he met
974200	977940	two people that are supposed to join your squad, but they hadn't joined yet.
977940	981800	But then he went back to the ship, even though the story doesn't give you a reason to go
981800	985280	back to the ship, he wanted to go back there because he felt he could progress one of the
985280	986880	romance storylines.
986880	990280	And those people who had not yet joined his squad on the ship.
990280	995280	So there's like weird shit going on with the flags in the game that should be pretty obvious
995320	999440	to anyone that played the game start to finish in some different ways, you know, which is
999440	1000800	what you do in QA.
1000800	1007840	So, and I'm not blaming Bioware or EA's QA department, because my thought is, they're
1007840	1012320	probably, these issues are probably well aware and documented, but there was a mandate that
1012320	1016960	that game had to be out by the end of the financial year, and that was the mistake.
1016960	1023000	Because even though it sounds like I'm being very negative on the game, I actually, like,
1023000	1024520	it's pretty fucking amazing.
1024520	1030640	Like the scope of the game, the scope of all there is to do in the game, and that's even
1030640	1033440	without bringing multiplayer into it.
1033440	1038440	And the vast variety of conversations you can have, and all this stuff that's going
1038440	1045180	on, like, I actually feel like this is a incredibly epic game underneath all that shit that should
1045180	1049400	have been better, like, underneath all that, it's a pretty amazing game.
1049400	1053880	And so it kind of sucks that they rushed this out, because I think this game could have
1053920	1057160	been a 10 out of 10 if it had come out holiday 2017.
1057160	1058160	Probably.
1058160	1061520	Because they would have had time to iron out the bucks, and it still very well could get
1061520	1064240	better with bug patches and stuff like that.
1064240	1067000	Yeah, but now, who's gonna care now?
1067000	1068000	Because...
1068000	1070000	People care when they patch it in that new ending.
1070000	1074400	A game kind of lives and dies by its, you know, release week, or what have you.
1074400	1077900	Which, you know, for better or for worse, not that I necessarily agree with it, but,
1077900	1081360	you know, will they slice the price of the game down to 30 bucks and then try to make
1081360	1082360	the money on DLC?
1082360	1083360	They already cut the price of the game.
1083360	1084360	What?
1084360	1086520	Yeah, I think they dropped about 24% of these.
1086520	1088760	I saw an article somewhere that said that.
1088760	1091000	Wow, that's something else if it's already dropped.
1091000	1096880	I mean, but here's the other unfortunate thing, is that for those of you guys that are rooting
1096880	1101160	for this game to fail, like, eat my entire ass.
1101160	1105800	Like seriously, like, as a fan of Mass Effect, eat my ass.
1105800	1112400	Because I don't want you guys to fuck this up and rob me of a sequel for Mass Effect
1112440	1113440	Andromeda.
1113440	1118720	Because I think back to the original trilogy and Mass Effect 1, 2, and 3.
1118720	1122240	And Mass Effect 1 kind of had a lot of issues too.
1122240	1126120	And especially when it came to driving, which this game has those same issues when it comes
1126120	1128240	to driving, right?
1128240	1133560	I feel like Mass Effect Andromeda 2 could be really, really fucking amazing, just like
1133560	1136640	Mass Effect 2 was, and then the third game could be great too.
1136640	1140320	But now I'm worried because of all of this fuckery that's going on on the internet, we're
1140320	1143240	not going to get that, and that would be a tragedy.
1143240	1146400	It would be a tragedy if we don't get a Mass Effect Andromeda 2.
1146400	1152000	I hope they do it the right way, and I hope they give it the time it needs to develop,
1152000	1157640	but I'm worried that all of this negativity is going to be a fucking snowball down the
1157640	1161200	mountain, and we're not going to end up seeing a Mass Effect Andromeda 2 because of it.
1161200	1168000	Because people, you know, were swayed by GIFs and ten second YouTube clips and things.
1168000	1169880	We'll see what the sales do.
1169880	1171720	Of what went wrong.
1171720	1174680	And some of that onus is on EA as well, I don't think they should have done the ten
1174680	1176520	hour preview.
1176520	1179000	Especially if the game was only half done and a lot of these issues are going to come
1179000	1180000	to light.
1180000	1186040	You need to sell those thirty dollar passes to play, you know, games early.
1186040	1188160	Pay for Violin Street Date.
1188160	1193820	Okay, so going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com, Dungeon Buster I think really feels similarly
1193820	1198400	to how I do, that says I could go on but it would sound like I actually hate the game,
1198400	1202460	which weirdly I don't because there are things that I actually like in it, but damn, what
1202460	1205280	the fuck happened to quality control?
1205280	1207960	And that's exactly where my head's at right here.
1207960	1211760	Tech2030 in chat says, is it the first game in a new trilogy?
1211760	1215640	I would assume that is the plan, but we'll see.
1215640	1221280	Dungeon Buster, with a hopeful comment that may make me feel a little better about things
1221280	1224760	and what's happening on the internet, Dungeon Buster says, Assassin's Creed Unity hasn't
1224760	1227880	stopped that franchise.
1227880	1230120	I hope you're right, I hope you're onto something with that comment.
1230120	1238600	It's okay, Mass Effect Andromeda, it was a development variation.
1238600	1242000	There's other things I could kind of get into in Mass Effect as well, and I feel like I
1242000	1247800	need to address some of these things, although I'm opening a whole can of worms, but I'm
1247800	1249360	just going to fucking say it.
1249360	1252520	So obviously there's a lot of controversy going on out there because, I don't know if
1252520	1255280	you've heard about this, Loki, I know you probably don't follow all this as closely
1255280	1261000	as I do, but you are aware that part of a big draw to Mass Effect games is that the
1261000	1266800	subtitle should just be, Mass Effect Andromeda, who do I get to fuck?
1266800	1267800	That's what a lot of these games are about.
1267800	1268800	That's what people want to know.
1268800	1270360	Who do you get to fuck?
1270360	1271360	Is it everybody?
1271360	1272360	No.
1272360	1273360	No.
1273360	1279800	And that's part of what's happening here, because as a player who wants to play a gay
1279800	1283040	male shepherd, you have two romance options in the game.
1283040	1284040	I hope that isn't spoilery.
1284080	1286840	I'm sorry if, I'm very sorry if this is spoilery.
1286840	1287840	Gay writer, I guess.
1287840	1289960	I will not say who they are, okay?
1289960	1296720	So gay writer has two options on who he can romance, and in one of the romance scenes,
1296720	1301020	it does like a whole little flirtatious thing, and they're kind of like, they're kissing
1301020	1304800	and stuff, and then they kind of get into bed, and it fades to black, right?
1304800	1309040	The dot, dot, dot, and you know what happens after that.
1309040	1312560	In one of the, I think there are, somebody may have to correct me on this number, I believe
1312680	1320080	there are at least four heterosexual male love scenes, so females, there are four females
1320080	1321080	you can romance, right?
1321080	1326680	I'm thinking in my high mind, there's her, there's her, there's her, and I think there's
1326680	1327680	one other.
1327680	1328680	So I think there's at least four.
1328680	1329680	I could be wrong.
1329680	1330680	There might be more.
1330680	1331680	Impressionator.
1331680	1337420	So in one of the scenes that I caught on YouTube of what happens with the male heterosexual
1337420	1341700	writer and one of the females, it's fucking porn.
1341700	1348820	Like it is, her titties are out, his ass is on display, she's sitting up on the counter,
1348820	1352540	he's pounding her, I'm not fucking kidding.
1352540	1355180	That's the soft core porn in the game.
1355180	1363820	Now look, I understand that anal might make some people uncomfortable, and I'm not saying
1363820	1369020	that that whole thing necessarily needs to be on the same display and all this, but why
1369020	1370020	is it?
1370020	1371020	You can do it tastefully.
1371020	1375140	You can do it tastefully, exactly, because that's what they're going to say about this
1375140	1380900	whole male and female writer thing is that, well, it was done tastefully.
1380900	1383900	It's a tasteful Cinemax scene.
1383900	1385340	There's a discrepancy there.
1385340	1389440	There's a discrepancy in how it was done, and there's a discrepancy in how many options
1389440	1391380	you have.
1391420	1393860	Gay men have yet to be able to fuck an alien.
1393860	1396980	I just want to point that out.
1396980	1399600	Straight men, not a problem since the very first game.
1399600	1404620	You could have your way, it's well documented in Mass Effect 1, you can bed an asari character
1404620	1408220	in that game, and that trend kind of continues on into this game.
1408220	1411700	And there's female on female.
1411700	1412940	Where are my gay women at?
1412940	1415280	Hey, they have plenty of options as well.
1415280	1419240	Gay women have, I think, the same four options.
1419240	1423500	I'm sorry, I did not commit to memory all these different options, but gay women have
1423500	1428360	more options than gay men do.
1428360	1433880	By the way, there's a trophy in the game for romancing three different people throughout
1433880	1435680	the course of the game.
1435680	1438460	Now, think about that for a minute.
1438460	1442680	How many did I just tell you gay writer gets to romance?
1442680	1443800	Two.
1443800	1452120	So you can't earn that trophy if you're gay writer, and of course, here's the witty retort,
1452120	1457380	here comes the tweet from the egg icon on Twitter, well, you could still get the, you're
1457380	1462000	not banned from getting the trophy, all you have to do is sleep with a woman.
1462000	1466880	Right, because I haven't fucking heard that line over my 38 years of existence.
1466880	1468280	Again, here's the spoon.
1468280	1471240	It's just for the trophies, okay?
1471240	1472240	It means nothing, but.
1472280	1476080	And drama is about procreation, which is funny because they get into that whole thing, and
1476080	1479840	I actually thought that part was well done because one of the gay characters feels a
1479840	1484060	little bit of guilt about the fact that there's supposed to be procreation, but I actually
1484060	1486240	thought that was well done, but I digress.
1486240	1493720	So anyway, but here's my worry, and I understand there is a trans character in the game that's
1493720	1496480	getting a lot of pushback as well.
1496480	1501720	I am not trans myself, so I feel like I can't really present this in the same way about
1501720	1508840	how this is offensive, but essentially, imagine it's this.
1508840	1513560	So I'm gonna walk up to you, hey, Loki, how you doing today?
1513560	1516680	By the way, did you know that I used to be a woman and my name was blank?
1516680	1522480	Like that's kinda how it's done in Mass Effect Andromeda.
1522480	1526440	That's the thing, it's like, I actually was, it was one of these videos that was complaining
1526440	1530620	about the social justice stuff, and I happened to watch it, and they were talking about that
1530620	1534180	this isn't the first game Bioware has done this, like they said they did that in Dragon
1534180	1540080	Age Inquisition as well, like one of the characters you meet, she's just like, hi, I'm such and
1540080	1545580	such, IP standing up, it's like, where the fuck did that come from?
1545580	1547440	Just ridiculous stuff.
1547440	1552980	So it's something that they've done in previous games, but it's like, kind of almost seems
1552980	1557780	like that they're doing it not to be progressive, it's just like, oh, we're just ticking the
1557780	1562220	box because we wanna make sure this market's being taken care of.
1562220	1569100	Funny enough, even though that might not be the best way to come to that conclusion, but
1569100	1574340	I feel like that's kinda it, like this is where a lot of people who appreciate the diversity
1574340	1578060	or have in the past that Bioware's been trying to go for in some of these games are getting
1578060	1582060	a little annoyed, because now it's starting to feel like we're ticking boxes.
1582060	1587300	And again, I'm not trans myself, but so you guys understand, if you don't happen to know
1587300	1592820	anybody who's trans, what I'm told is to just come out and blurt what they call your
1592820	1593820	dead name.
1593820	1600620	Essentially, that was the name before you transitioned, right?
1600620	1602540	That's like something that doesn't fucking happen.
1602540	1605980	Like you don't go up to somebody and just say like, hi, did you know my name used to
1605980	1606980	be blank?
1606980	1608980	Like that's just not the way it works.
1608980	1615980	But you have to wonder, and again, if we happen to have any trans people out there listening,
1615980	1620000	I would love to hear your perspective on this, if you're okay with the way it was done,
1620000	1624860	or if it pisses you off and why, because I would like to hear from that perspective,
1624860	1629580	but I'm trying to represent you all the best I can.
1629580	1637860	But this whole thing is like, did they have to do it that way so that maybe the people
1637860	1642540	who don't know somebody who's trans or who doesn't have that in their life would not
1642540	1645140	be able to get confused?
1645140	1654700	I mean, I don't know, and I'm not saying that's how they should have done it at all.
1654700	1659020	I'm just like, who thought that was a good idea?
1659020	1664620	That was just a weird way to do it, or at least get to know that character a little
1664620	1666540	bit first.
1666540	1671380	Make that character, I mean, heaven forbid we go there, make that character a romanceable
1671380	1672380	option.
1672380	1676060	And when you get to know that character more and more, then maybe she unveils a little
1676060	1681340	bit more about her past, doesn't necessarily blurt out what her name used to be, but maybe
1681340	1687100	explains a little more about what, oh my God, can you imagine some of those egg icons on
1687100	1688100	Twitter?
1688100	1693100	What would happen if like, oh yeah, and see, then the problem is like, oh, hey, I romance
1693100	1695580	this hot female and you can guess what happened.
1695580	1701060	But that plays into another really bad trope that I can understand why Bioware would not
1701060	1705860	want to go down that road, because, you know, that's a whole slippery slope of its own.
1705860	1709940	Or here's what you could have done in the first place, why the fuck did you even have,
1709940	1711860	like, why the fuck did you decide in this game?
1711860	1714500	Yeah, we're gonna let you fuck the crew members.
1714500	1717440	Why even have that in a sci-fi game?
1717440	1720620	Why are we even bringing sexuality into these games in the first place?
1720620	1724900	Just have it be a game without, like, who cares?
1724900	1729460	Because in a two-hour movie that's dramatic, sometimes the characters have sex, Loki.
1729460	1736020	Like, it's the same thing in space, in a 60-hour plus epic game about drama, sometimes
1736020	1738180	you get closer to the characters and sometimes you have sex with them.
1738180	1739180	Like that's what it is.
1739180	1744340	You just fucking do it the Saints Row four way, which is, you can fuck everyone.
1744340	1745900	That's it.
1745900	1752060	Okay, going to chat over at live.voggenetwork.com, let's see, William Murderface says, I know
1752060	1757740	a couple people who are, and I think mentioning trans, and yeah, many don't tend to talk about
1757740	1758780	their dead names.
1758780	1762580	Of course, there are some who just don't give a fuck, but they seem to be a statistical
1762580	1764740	anomalies in that regard.
1764740	1766720	Dungeon Buster, I think, sums it up very well here.
1766720	1767720	This is nice.
1767720	1771940	The writing could have opened up more opportunities to learn more about that specific character
1771940	1774900	instead of just putting out a verbal billboard.
1774900	1778820	And Alex P. Carson answering your question, Loki says, sex.
1778820	1779820	Just because.
1779820	1780820	Sex.
1780820	1781820	Sex sounds like it.
1781820	1785100	I get it, but if they're not gonna do it smart, then what's the point, you know?
1785100	1787740	Don't implement a feature you can't implement correctly.
1787780	1793380	Alright, so anyway, I had to mention some of those issues, and here's...
1793380	1798220	And yes, I didn't like Saints Row IV, not because you could romance everybody, because
1798220	1804620	I get the parody of that, but because it's not fucking Saints Row, it's just ridiculous
1804620	1806100	bullshit, the game.
1806100	1810260	Speaking of parody games, you posted that trailer on Twitter this week for that goat
1810260	1813660	simulator game, the goat simulator in space or whatever.
1813660	1816460	That looked fucking hilarious.
1816460	1820220	It was hitting on everything that Mass Effect is known for, including the romance scenes,
1820220	1826700	and I was like, well, brava, goat simulator developers, brava on you.
1826700	1828300	I'm excited to play that at some point.
1828300	1829620	I think it came out this week, actually.
1829620	1830620	Oh, did it come out this week?
1830620	1831620	The DLC, yeah.
1831620	1832620	I'm gonna have to check that out.
1832620	1833620	Here's...
1833620	1837100	Okay, this is the one other thing I want to say with all this social justice stuff and
1837100	1843060	all the trans representation and the gay male representation and so forth, is there's a
1843060	1846820	lot of this negativity that BioWare is getting in the reception because they should have
1846820	1850820	done better rather than just tick a box.
1850820	1856880	My concern is, are they going to then not do this in the future?
1856880	1860520	Because they're gonna say like, well, if we put a trans character or we put a gay character
1860520	1864780	or we put a XYZ character in the game, we're just gonna get all this hate mail, so next
1864780	1865960	time we're not gonna bother.
1865960	1869780	Try harder then, instead of just giving up because you failed the first time.
1869780	1870780	You gotta fail fast.
1870780	1874860	You gotta just, you try something, you take your feedback, you make it better.
1874860	1876900	Not just, oh, people didn't like it.
1876900	1878220	Well, too fucking bad.
1878220	1879220	You know what?
1879220	1880760	You try harder next time.
1880760	1882380	I am fucking proud of you, Loki.
1882380	1883500	Give me a high five.
1883500	1890300	That was, I, guys, that was Loki that just gave that statement.
1890300	1894300	You know, for every person that comes to me and says, when is Loki gonna shut the fuck
1894300	1895620	up about Nintendo?
1895620	1896620	Never.
1896620	1899460	I'm gonna play that back because you're okay, Loki.
1899460	1901020	At the end of the day, you're okay.
1901020	1905660	But it's, I mean, seriously, it's, I think the frustrates me the most about some people
1905660	1908620	is just like, willing to give up so easily.
1908620	1912820	It's just, why don't you just take the feedback from it and learn from it?
1912820	1917780	There's always gonna be people, you can't appease everyone, but do it in a way that
1917780	1923420	makes sense instead of just, hi, my name is, you know, so and so.
1923420	1924780	Did you know I used to have a penis?
1924780	1927940	I mean, like, that's stupid, you know, just have them.
1927940	1932500	Nobody does that, or at least very few people probably do that.
1932500	1939500	But I just think there's easier ways to just develop it and more naturally, better writing.
1939500	1940500	Get better writers.
1940500	1943500	So, and here's, here's the thing.
1943500	1945700	I mean, as much as, how long has the show been on now?
1945700	1946700	Half an hour.
1946700	1949900	We've been talking about Mass Effect for half an hour.
1949900	1950900	It's like Jamie's here.
1950900	1954780	And it's, well, to be fair, I'm as bad as she is.
1954780	1957780	And for the most part, we've been shitting on a lot of elements of Mass Effect.
1957780	1961780	But I want to stress, there's a lot of good in Mass Effect.
1961780	1964860	There's a lot, a lot of, lot of good.
1964860	1972220	But it's extraordinarily frustrating to see these things that flopped, that could have
1972220	1976940	been fixed if the game had just gone through another few months of quality check.
1976940	1980540	And at the end of the day, that's, that's what, like, even, even some of these things
1980540	1986380	we're talking about with, with the representation of the different minorities, like, maybe if
1986380	1991060	the game had had a longer QA period, they could have brought in some more gay men, some
1991060	1995820	more trans individuals, some more, you know, to play the game and give that, give this
1995820	1998300	feedback that now they're getting on Twitter.
1998300	1999300	So.
1999300	2001980	I would be surprised if they don't have that feedback already.
2001980	2002980	I mean, cause come on.
2002980	2005180	I mean, they've been doing this for how many games now?
2005180	2006180	Yeah.
2006180	2008340	Like, so that should be there.
2008340	2012420	And I mean, I think EA is a pretty progressive company.
2012420	2013420	They have staff for-
2014060	2018060	To be fair, I know EA has gotten a lot of shit over the years, but EA was there at the
2018060	2025160	very first GamerX, EA is in the pride parades, EA's, EA's, EA's trying to do the right thing.
2025160	2029980	You know, so I, I can't believe I'm going to say it, but just, just go back to what
2029980	2035100	Loki said a little bit ago, take the feedback and do better.
2035100	2036100	There it is.
2036100	2040940	Ah, uh, William Ritterface in chat says, isn't it the case that we often criticize that which
2040940	2045940	we want to see succeed most, not because we hate it, but because we want it to do well.
2045940	2049820	So this is not surprising, which by the way, since I just, I mentioned it, it's kind of
2049820	2054860	a joke a minute ago, but it's, it's so the case again, listen to this, Loki, isn't it
2054860	2058700	the case that we often criticize that which we want to see succeed most?
2058700	2059700	Nintendo.
2059700	2060700	Yes.
2060700	2066100	It, well, we criticize Nintendo because we know that they're capable of better.
2066100	2067660	And that's, that's the frustration.
2067660	2071380	And it's like, dude, you used to be fucking phenomenal.
2071380	2073940	There's their games were fucking phenomenal.
2073940	2078260	And it's like now they're just hitting, they're like setting the bar so low for themselves.
2078260	2081420	It's just like, come on you guys, I know you can do better.
2081420	2083100	You got an A on the last report.
2083100	2085900	Why are you getting C's now?
2085900	2089020	That's kind of spoken like a true father.
2089020	2090020	That's the thing.
2090020	2093200	It's like my, my kids do this all the time and that's, you know, comes with the frustration
2093200	2096900	of quitting because it's like, oh, I don't want to do this cause it's hard cause they
2096900	2097900	got it wrong.
2097900	2098900	Or I know I'm going to get it wrong.
2098900	2102380	Well, you're not trying and that pisses me off even more than you failing.
2102380	2105540	Well, not that pissing, not that you failing would piss me off.
2105540	2108220	It's just, you know, try it.
2108220	2109620	God damn it.
2109620	2114600	Um, tiger Han chat says, sky, what do you think of games and comic book movies trying
2114600	2117740	to shoehorn LGBT characters just to appeal?
2117740	2120220	I think it's appeal, not appear to the demographic.
2120220	2122900	Uh, yeah, that's quite obvious actually.
2122900	2124980	I think here's the thing.
2124980	2128540	I'll bring up the power Rangers movie cause that was all in the news, right?
2128540	2133100	The fact like, OMG, it's the first like gay superhero or what have you, right?
2133100	2139060	Like honestly, it's not, how do I phrase this?
2139060	2143300	I want to say it's not a huge moment in the movie, although it kind of is during a key
2143300	2147220	moment as to what is bringing these five individuals together and so forth.
2147220	2151340	Um, so, but, but what, what I'm trying to say is that the, I don't want to say it's
2151340	2155740	a throwaway line, but it's just one of those things that's kind of like quickly like, yeah,
2155740	2156820	that's kind of what's going on.
2156820	2162540	And then it's like we move on into the discussion and that's kind of, I don't know, in some
2162540	2169540	ways, I kind of like that as when I tell people that I happen to be gay and I'm married to
2169540	2173140	a man, I kind of like that they can just go, all right, cool.
2173140	2175380	So do you guys have a cat?
2175380	2177420	You know, like that's, that's it, right?
2177420	2181860	Like that's, that's kind of how I prefer the conversations to go is that it's not a big
2181860	2182860	fucking deal.
2182860	2185900	Like if people have questions, I'm happy to answer as long as it comes from a place of
2185900	2186900	education.
2186900	2192340	But, you know, don't ask the question like, well, well, well, who's on top in that relationship?
2192340	2193340	That's not your fucking business.
2193340	2194420	It should be like that.
2194420	2198900	It's just like if you saw an interracial couple, oh, your, your, your wife's black.
2198900	2200780	I mean, like, so how's that work?
2200780	2206220	I mean, like no one does that anymore because it's, it's such a, a normal thing and that's,
2206220	2207220	well, well, okay.
2207260	2213380	Most people don't, when I say everyone, I mean every sane person.
2213380	2216580	So most people don't say that.
2216580	2218460	It's like, it's not even a thing that you think about.
2218460	2221180	And I think we're almost, we'll be there soon.
2221180	2223540	You know, where it's just like, oh, you guys are married.
2223540	2224540	Cool.
2224540	2225540	I mean, that's it.
2225540	2227540	I mean, that's how it should be.
2227540	2229180	It shouldn't even be a thing.
2229180	2230180	Yeah.
2230180	2231180	I know.
2231180	2232540	I'm trying to fantasize about people naked.
2232540	2239700	So next time somebody, not, not that anybody's dumb enough to actually ask me who's on top
2239700	2240700	in that relationship.
2240700	2244060	I I'm going to, I mean, would you like to know, I'm trying to picture me naked.
2244060	2245300	Do you want to just see me naked?
2245300	2247420	Like is that what we're getting at here?
2247420	2248740	Um, but okay.
2248740	2250460	So back to the whole power ranger thing, right?
2250460	2253620	So actually the way they did it in the movie was fine.
2253620	2261100	It's the whole fucking internet fuck fest that's going on on like the whole, like, oh
2261100	2264860	my God, it's a lesbian power ranger.
2264860	2269540	They, this whole big thing is so this stuff that's going on and the fact that it's like
2269540	2274260	a adult rated movie in Russia and all this stuff is going on, that's just kind of like,
2274260	2278060	that's the part where I'm going like, fucking calm down.
2278060	2280060	It's 2017.
2280060	2281140	Don't get me wrong.
2281140	2283340	I appreciate the representation.
2283340	2290140	I think it's fucking fantastic that this ranger can say, yeah, I'm having girlfriend problems.
2290180	2292300	And the other rangers are like, okay, cool.
2292300	2294580	And, and like moving on, like I'm cool.
2294580	2300980	And so that way, if there is a little girl out there who has some, well, you know, I
2300980	2304260	need to choose my words carefully here because nobody under a certain age should probably
2304260	2307700	be having romantic feelings of any kind, but you know, a teenage, when I say a little,
2307700	2312940	I mean like a teenage girl, who's the age in the movie is having these conflicting feelings.
2312940	2315980	Being able to see some of that representation, like, oh fuck, there's like somebody like
2315980	2317380	me out there.
2317380	2318380	Right.
2318900	2323580	And this is a battle that continues on for racial minorities too.
2323580	2327780	And that whole thing, like, you know, why did we have this whole thing with the Oscars
2327780	2332620	a couple of years ago, where it was the Oscar so white and all this stuff, because, you
2332620	2337940	know, I think a lot of black individuals like to see themselves in movies and there was
2337940	2344340	a lot of great talent and great movies that were going extremely like unrecognized and
2344340	2345340	so forth.
2346220	2353460	A lot changed for the better this year, but I would, I would, we're not there yet, but
2353460	2358020	things are going in the right direction where now we are acknowledging and hopefully at
2358020	2365340	the end of the day, opening up more roles for people that are not just like white men.
2365340	2367100	You know, that's, that's what it is.
2367100	2370940	Anyway, I don't want to get too preachy on the show, but that's, you know how it goes.
2370940	2373420	Go into chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
2373420	2376540	Tiger claw and chat says, sky, you heard the internet is going ape shit over wonder
2376540	2378300	woman's armpit.
2378300	2379300	What the fuck?
2379300	2380300	No.
2380300	2381300	What does she not shave it or something?
2381300	2382940	Is that a thing?
2382940	2383940	Gives a shit.
2383940	2386060	Who's actually free streaming that shit to check.
2386060	2390820	If she grew up in the fucking jungle, I would think that she probably doesn't shave her
2390820	2395300	armpit and that's probably historically accurate, which I can't believe I'm saying about a comic
2395300	2396300	book movie.
2396300	2399860	But I mean, yeah, somebody's got too much time on their hands.
2399860	2400860	You know why?
2400860	2403020	You know why somebody noticed it?
2403020	2406940	Because it took them out of the sexualization of wonder woman for a minute.
2406940	2410220	Like I can't fap to her now.
2410220	2416380	She doesn't, she doesn't, she doesn't buy these products to, to conform to some sort
2416380	2418180	of standard that magazines has put out there.
2418180	2421060	I can't fap to her anymore.
2421060	2422460	That's why somebody noticed it.
2422460	2425940	Once again, people just giving up before they actually try.
2425940	2426940	Oh, is it?
2426940	2428620	Oh, Brad's telling me it's the other way around.
2428620	2430020	It's because she does shave.
2430180	2431180	Oh my God.
2431180	2433500	No one is fucking happy about anything.
2433500	2434500	Nobody's happy with anything.
2434500	2435500	Who cares?
2435500	2439500	Again, stop staring at her armpits.
2439500	2440500	It's okay.
2440500	2443020	Cause she has a massive bush under her fucking costume.
2443020	2446940	See, it's just, it's, it's even now.
2446940	2448940	Okay.
2448940	2452460	God, people are so complaining.
2452460	2456780	I swear people just want to fucking complain about anything on the internet because they'll
2456780	2458940	get fucking attention for it.
2459380	2461380	It's like everything.
2468100	2469540	I broke Rob.
2472660	2474580	I think we need to move on.
2474580	2476180	All right, let's do that.
2476180	2479220	Uh, wait, we need to talk about other games we've been playing this week besides just
2479220	2483140	Mass Effect and the same man called How Was Your Game?
2483140	2484740	Loki, how was your gaming week?
2484740	2489540	Um, so this week I actually played, well, I was going to play more, um, Zelda, but you
2489540	2492340	know, honestly, I haven't felt compelled to do it.
2492340	2496420	That weapon, you know, the weapon damage to something is really bothering me.
2496420	2498460	So I just, I haven't gotten around to it.
2498460	2503420	Um, instead I played more Skyrim, so I made it through which storylines now?
2503420	2508140	So I went through the rest of the actual Civil War storylines.
2508140	2509140	That's all done.
2509140	2517100	Um, I think I did, um, I can't remember if I had finished the whole actual, like, Dragonborn,
2517100	2522820	not the DLC Dragonborn storyline, but the actual All the Winds storyline in the game.
2522820	2524140	So I did that.
2524140	2529220	Um, I started doing the Bard stuff now, which is completely boring, but I'm going to get
2529220	2530220	through that pretty quick.
2530220	2535060	And then it's going to be on to Dawnguard because I figure if I complete the Dawnguard
2535060	2539860	DLC, then they can stop fucking telling me about stupid Dawnguard, and that's really
2539860	2542420	my only motivation to finish that DLC.
2542420	2545340	So I finished it before when I had mods on there, but now that I'm playing a whole new
2545340	2550060	save, I got to do it again, but my god, it's seriously irritating.
2550060	2553700	Um, so then the other thing I've been doing, um, like, because I was unaware that they
2553700	2557140	have this going on, this whole water festival thing in Pokemon, I just thought, like, this
2557140	2559820	is a weird glitch, that there's, like, fish everywhere.
2559820	2563060	And so then finally I read up, oh, it's an event going on.
2563060	2567740	So I thought the game was just broken, which, you know, wouldn't be that far off.
2567740	2572820	So I've been playing quite a bit to get, um, you know, as many new Pokemon as I can, because,
2572820	2576880	you know, I don't normally go near water, I'm not going to San Francisco or anything,
2576880	2580980	so a lot of these are brand new for my stuff, and it just, it's a good way to kill time
2580980	2585380	when I have to sit at a birthday party, for example, like I did today.
2585380	2588740	Um, and then what else did I play?
2588740	2596460	Um, I played briefly, because I installed it for my son, Super Mario Run, on Android,
2596460	2601540	so I put it on his tablet for him, and the only thing that really pisses me off about
2601540	2605700	Super Mario Run is the forced tutorial that they have in the beginning, because all I
2605700	2610380	wanted to do was, like, quickly install it on there, and just pay for it so that the
2610380	2613780	app is unlocked, and then go, and let my son just play the game.
2613780	2618060	But no, I had to do, they had to show me every fucking element from the stupid game, it took
2618100	2623500	for goddamn ever just to finish the thing, and it plays okay, I just don't, it's not
2623500	2627140	a game I'm interested in, he really loves it, he's been playing it, like, all the last
2627140	2631340	two days, so, um, you know, he got that going for him, plus it's easy enough for him to
2631340	2634860	be able to play, you know, he's just like, oh, I really like the fact that I can play
2634860	2639060	this, you know, because, um, he can put the easy mode on if he dies or something like
2639060	2644500	that, and he's almost finished all the levels, so it's, you know, props to them for that.
2645060	2649900	I think it's worth the money for his entertainment, it's not something I would buy for myself,
2649900	2655940	but kids like it, I guess that's kind of the demographic, so, um, so yeah, and then that's
2655940	2662180	what I played, and then, um, that was really it, yeah, I bought a 3D printer, I haven't
2662180	2665380	Did you, that's right, I knew you were gonna get that, you actually bought it, huh?
2665380	2666540	Yeah, I decided to do it.
2666540	2667540	That's awesome.
2667540	2668540	What are you gonna print?
2668540	2669540	A gun?
2669540	2674380	If I want to, but no, I'm not gonna print a gun, um, no, actually, there's a lot of
2674420	2678780	projects, like, that I want to make stuff that, you know, requires, like, 3D printing
2678780	2682820	or something of the sort, and so I thought it'd be just, you know, kind of fun to be
2682820	2687940	able to get one of those, so I got a TiVo Tarantula, which is like a Prusa i3 Chinese
2687940	2694300	knockoff thing, so it's not perfect when I get it, so I have to do a lot of fixes and
2694300	2698140	mods to it, which will be fun, because I get to learn the process, and there's a lot of
2698140	2703700	troubleshooting with those, which is not exactly ideal for some people, but I like the challenge
2703700	2710180	of it, so I'm very curious to see how that's gonna go, um, so yeah, I ordered it, they
2710180	2714220	haven't shipped it yet, because they have, they drop ship, and so they'll probably ship
2714220	2719820	it sometime in the next week, so hopefully I should have it probably, uh, probably a
2719820	2722260	couple weeks, so be able to try it.
2722260	2727540	Ragenator in chat with the question, what's the TTP on that 3D printer, Loki OLR, and
2727540	2734140	if you're new to OLR, TTP is timed penis, which is whenever game makers give you something
2734140	2739540	where you can create, i.e. LittleBigPlanet, i.e. Super Mario Maker, whatever, how long
2739540	2740940	until somebody does a penis?
2740940	2741940	It's usually a matter of seconds.
2741940	2746340	I'm sure that they probably, someone's already, I'm sure someone's already 3D printed a penis,
2746340	2750920	if whether I'm gonna 3D print a penis, probably not, because prints take like several hours,
2750920	2755780	that's a lot of dedication and like, money, I mean, I don't see the need to print a 3D
2755780	2766020	penis for anything, so, I probably, I probably will not print a 3D penis on there, um, but
2766020	2768860	never say never, so, you know.
2768860	2774180	Alright, uh, come on, Noel Gust in chat says, print OLR bobbleheads, there you go, that'll
2774180	2778780	give you something a little, you've got other products, there's something up your sleeve
2778780	2781020	you're gonna want to print, you bought it for something.
2781020	2784900	I just bought it because I wanted to buy something, I don't know, it's either that or upgrade
2784900	2789780	my computer, and upgrading my computer was, uh, more expensive, so I decided, I decided
2789780	2793460	just to do this, because it was only actually out the door, I think it was only like $2.65,
2793460	2797980	so, not bad at all, plus it's a kit, I could build it, it's even better.
2797980	2798980	Fun!
2798980	2799980	Awesome.
2799980	2802900	Uh, let's see, my gaming week, so obviously I've been playing a crap ton of Mass Effect
2802900	2806560	Andromeda, that's really been the game that's dominating my week, which again, despite everything
2806560	2810660	we talked about in the beginning of the game, I really think there is like, I, I don't,
2810660	2816060	I don't know how else to explain it, it's like, there's this fantastic, like, core game
2816060	2819740	that's amazing, and there's all these worlds to see, and then it's like, it's wrapped in
2819740	2820740	tin foil.
2820740	2825140	Like, I, I don't, I don't know how else to, to describe it, uh, I, I do think there's
2825140	2829980	more good than bad in Andromeda, but unfortunately these bad things need to be talked about,
2829980	2834660	because I think, I, I really do think when people kind of go back at the end of the year,
2834660	2838540	we're talking about the game of the year, which will undoubtedly be Zelda, I don't,
2838540	2842580	I mean, unless there's some big holiday surprises at the end of the year.
2842580	2843580	Reddit Redemption 2?
2843580	2844580	That's probably 2018.
2844580	2848460	Well, I, I, I just, I really don't see how Zelda Breath of the Wild isn't like game of
2848460	2853060	the year at this point, and why, why it's Zelda and not Mass Effect Andromeda.
2853060	2856660	I just need to give it more time, same with like Final Fantasy 15, man, all these games
2856660	2860620	are in my backlog now that, like, I was really looking forward to those, and it's kind of
2860620	2865140	like, eh, when they came out, you know, it's, yeah, I don't know.
2865140	2868700	But you know, I think we're gonna look back and say, God, they really should have delayed
2868700	2871380	Mass Effect Andromeda, and it probably could have been game of the year if it came out
2871380	2875640	during the holiday, but, you know, EA wants to make, you know, be in, be in the black
2875640	2879020	for their financial year, so they didn't want to delay it again, but we'll see, we'll see
2879020	2881140	if that costs them.
2881140	2883180	Anyway, so I did play other games.
2883180	2887300	I played, of course, I always play Final Fantasy 14, that's always kind of, even if I'm, like,
2887300	2889980	binging on Mass Effect, like, there just comes a point where I'm like, okay, I can't play
2889980	2893980	any more Mass Effect tonight, I'm gonna just do something else, because, you know, I just
2893980	2896660	need to take my mind off Mass Effect for a little bit and do something else, so I'll
2896660	2901020	play a little bit of Final Fantasy 14, or there's been a couple other games as well.
2901020	2905100	I didn't talk about this last week, so I need to bring it up now, but Loki, an old favorite
2905100	2911300	of yours, and mine, came out on the PlayStation 4 a week ago, Clicker Heroes, on the PlayStation
2911300	2915300	4, believe it or not, which, Yes, I've purposely avoided that.
2915300	2919140	Look, and if you don't know, So is it, like, button press heroes now?
2919140	2923180	Yeah, it's basically button press heroes, square, square heroes, because you get square
2923180	2926100	over and over as the click.
2926100	2929380	It's the same game, there's not a lot to say about it, it's one of those colossal fucking
2929380	2932360	time wasters, it's a calculator game, right?
2932360	2936980	Just like cookie clickers, one plus one equals, equals equals equals equals equals equals
2936980	2939660	equals equals equals, so you just watch the number grow.
2939660	2942140	That's what these games end up being, like, that non-stop night we were playing on the
2942140	2946900	phone for a little bit that Brad from Pop Culture got us into, all those games are calculator
2946900	2951500	games, and so is Clicker Heroes, except it's on the PlayStation 4, and, do you know how
2951500	2956620	that fucking game sucked me into, like, come on, one more time, Rob Roberts, come on, I
2956620	2961580	know, I know we, you played way too much of me on the PC, but come on, Rob, one more time,
2961580	2962860	you know what got me in?
2962860	2963860	Trophies.
2963860	2968840	They fucking put trophies in it, in a free-to-play game, and so, of course, I was like, well,
2968840	2973980	I mean, I can get that bronze trophy really easy, ascend one time, that doesn't take that
2973980	2974980	long to do.
2974980	2978860	So is it all the trophies that they had, like, in the game before, like, but now with actual
2978860	2979860	trophies?
2979860	2983220	No, because there was a ton of trophies in the game, like, the little mini-achievements
2983220	2986860	and stuff, those are all still there, but you only actually get trophies for, like,
2986860	2991260	maybe ten different things, and there's no platinum, so I think you could probably knock
2991260	2994660	a few of them out in an hour, but then if you want to get the rest, you're gonna have
2994660	2999460	to invest some serious stuff, like, one of them is, like, get to zone 3600, which I think
2999460	3007480	is a gold, but, I mean, it's gonna take a long time to get to zone 3600, so, you know.
3007480	3011800	But it's a cute little time waster, again, in between sessions of other games, I just,
3011800	3015520	the one thing I'm gonna complain about that game is that it doesn't work in sleep mode.
3015520	3020320	If you put it in sleep mode, and then, you know, wake up your PlayStation 4 later, you
3020320	3022720	don't get any coins from when it was sleeping.
3022720	3024280	You have to close the game.
3024280	3025520	Oh, yeah, yeah.
3025520	3028840	That needs to be fixed, and that's the one complaint I have about it.
3028840	3032760	I understand why they don't do that, because stuff's not supposed to persist, it's basically,
3032760	3037440	like, a save state, so you're freezing everything, so I understand that part of it.
3038280	3041320	Yeah, I mean, I understand why it's happening, but it's stupid, they need to figure out how
3041320	3042320	to fix that.
3042320	3046360	Like, save the game right before it sleeps, and then reload it, or do something, I don't
3046360	3047360	know.
3047360	3048360	But anyway.
3048360	3054480	I'm just too, the problem with those games is that I'm too compelled to cheat, and I
3054480	3059000	will find a way to cheat, whether that means modding a controller to, like, put a timing
3059000	3060000	switch in there.
3060000	3062000	Get one of those little woodpecker things.
3062000	3066960	Auto-fire triggers or something, you know, I will find a way to cheat in that game, and
3067000	3069000	then it'll be just like, okay, this is stupid.
3069000	3070000	Yeah.
3070000	3075560	All right, so there's Clicker Heroes, and then on the Switch this week, I checked out
3075560	3080280	Splatoon 2 during the test fire, which, over this weekend, I think it's done now, I think,
3080280	3083320	or the last one might be at 8 o'clock tonight, no, I think it actually wrapped up this morning,
3083320	3087120	I don't think there are any more play periods, but there were six play periods, I checked
3087120	3092160	out two of them, and I played a little bit of Splatoon 2, and there really wasn't a lot
3092160	3096920	to it, because you couldn't customize the characters, you could pick one of four weapons,
3096920	3101800	you couldn't play with friends, you couldn't really control anything, but again, it was
3101800	3106400	a free test fire, they really just wanted to test the server capabilities, and for the
3106400	3111160	most part, for me anyway, it ran fine, like, from the internet does it work perspective,
3111160	3112160	it was great.
3112160	3114560	I hope no one bought the system for that beta.
3114560	3120000	I doubt it, but it's a nice little, like, well, if you bought the system now and you
3120000	3122960	don't own Zelda, like, what are you doing?
3122960	3125080	Like, I don't know what else you would have right now.
3125080	3128400	Much before the movie, they had, like, a big ol' thing about the Switch, where they
3128400	3133640	show off one, two Switch, that is literally the stupidest thing to show.
3133640	3138160	That's what they're trying to get the casuals with, is those games, so.
3138160	3141680	But what happened with getting the casuals with The Legend of Zelda when the first Nintendo
3141680	3142680	came out?
3142680	3146720	Fuck that, just playing, like, The Legend of Zelda, it's not casual, it's just, it's
3146720	3148880	a fucking great game.
3148880	3155040	So anyway, I enjoyed Splatoon enough, I mean, it was pretty much the same as the first game,
3155560	3160800	because you can't really peel back all the new layers, because this is just one particular
3160800	3161800	element of the game.
3161800	3167360	So again, I can't review Splatoon 2 based off an extremely limited demo of the game,
3167360	3172840	but I mean, it was that, it was that same game that I got into during Splatoon 1, and
3172840	3176280	I'm really excited to be able to play this with friends, like, again, the convention
3176280	3180320	thing is gonna be off the hook, like, I can't wait for that.
3180320	3185200	I did, okay, and somebody will correct me if I don't say, there is a new weapon, and
3185200	3188160	some of the new abilities are different, and there are, you know, things like that, but,
3188160	3192480	I mean, come on, those are incremental upgrades you'd kind of expect with a new Splatoon game,
3192480	3197360	so there's not a lot I can really say about it besides that, but I had fun that I played,
3197360	3202000	even though I think I only won, like, one match out of all the ones I played, but a
3202000	3206020	lot of them, we ended up four versus three, and a lot of them, I don't know if there were
3206020	3210700	people having connection problems, or just that many people were quitting, but, like,
3210700	3215360	I don't think I was losing because we were necessarily bad, we were losing because we
3215360	3220420	kept fucking being under, underrepresented, we only had three people to their four, and
3220420	3224460	of course you're gonna lose, so Nintendo does, I think, maybe need to figure out, can they
3224460	3229940	mitigate that problem somehow, can they have a robot that comes in and plays while it tries
3229940	3234060	to fill the space, like, I don't know, I, anyway.
3234100	3237980	I was gonna say, Bobby insists that there were no casual gamers when the original Zelda
3237980	3242620	came out, well, that's not true, there were casual arcade game players, so I would say
3242620	3245300	that there were casual game players, but.
3245300	3246300	But not the same way we think about it today.
3246300	3249700	Not the same way, yeah, exactly, and I think it's stupid to even say someone's a casual
3249700	3254600	game player, it's just like, can you have a casual movie watcher, I mean, I'm sorry,
3254600	3259340	you're not, you know, skilled enough to watch this movie, but watch this other movie, it's,
3259340	3263020	I don't know, it seems like a silly argument.
3263020	3267140	So I did try to do some of the other weapons besides just the roller, because I like to
3267140	3273180	play roller in Splatoon, and I can't stand playing Splatoon with motion controls, so
3273180	3276460	thank God I was able to turn those off, but that turned into a whole debate on Twitter.
3276460	3281060	I think it's because I play the roller, I don't enjoy motion controls, if I played something
3281060	3285340	that needed more aim, because I did try to play that new dual weapon thing, and like,
3285340	3288780	I was really horrible at aiming with it, and I was like, you know what, maybe this is why
3288780	3292640	you need motion controls, because you can aim so much better with it, but like, when
3292640	3297000	I play with motion controls, I'm having to hit that reset, the Y button will like, reorient
3297000	3300240	the camera, I'm hitting that like, repeatedly, but again, with a roller, you don't really
3300240	3304980	have to aim the same way, I mean, you do for some things, but for the most part, you don't,
3304980	3310040	so I don't know, I can get away with having motion controls off, but, eh, I don't know.
3310040	3313880	Still trying to shove it down your throat with the stupid motion controls, it's like
3313880	3316040	you- I don't know if they're necessarily shoving
3316040	3321840	it down your throat, then the fact that it does give you like, it's almost like it's
3321880	3326160	a trackball, like, imagine the motion controls and using the tilt controls is more like using
3326160	3329840	a trackball, and I mean, you can turn it off if you don't like it lowkey, so I don't think
3329840	3334680	they're necessarily shoving it down your throat, but it's like, a way to have something more-
3334680	3340560	because you know, like a mouse, it's the whole keyboard and mouse versus a right analog stick,
3340560	3344560	which I'm really noticing playing Mass Effect multiplayer, like I played a lot of Mass Effect
3344560	3350280	multiplayer with 3 on the PC, and now it's like, I have the hardest time aiming on the
3350280	3357080	two analog nubs on Playstation, like I kind of need a mouse, and so I think the motion
3357080	3360400	controls is to substitute for the mouse a little bit, even though yes, it's very very
3360400	3364480	different, it's not- I don't think it's what you think it is, Loki, when you say the forced
3364480	3368360	motion control thing, because it's just another way to be able to aim, basically.
3368360	3369880	No, I understand, it's like Zelda.
3369880	3376120	Yeah. So. Alright. Um, let's see, so that's it, I played a little Splatoon 2, I'm gonna
3376120	3379680	check out the game when it comes out, I'll get the retail version, just to be able to
3379680	3386480	play with friends, because I hope, I mean, if it comes out that the matchmaking sucks,
3386480	3390560	then I might reconsider that, but you know, I guess that's kind of an unknown element
3390560	3394640	right now, because I would have expected we would have had a hint as to what to expect
3394640	3398520	with the Nintendo app and all this stuff for the test fire this weekend, but none of that
3398520	3402320	was there, it was just, it was just, you got thrown in a match with random other people
3402320	3407960	and that was that. So, I wanna hear a little bit more about how that's all gonna work,
3408000	3413400	I mean, I would imagine now that's gonna have to be in place for Mario Kart 8, right? Mario
3413400	3419720	Kart 8's gonna need that. I don't know, we'll see. I don't know, I don't know. Alex P. Carson
3419720	3423840	in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com says, we're not gonna get into the mouse keyboard
3423840	3428760	versus controller thing, it'll never end, ain't that the truth? Alright, we're gonna
3428760	3432400	do at least one or two stories here, and then I gotta get to Dark Soccer and the classic
3432400	3435520	game of the week, because I said we'd call her at about 7, but oops, we ranted a little
3435520	3438720	too long in the beginning. So, we'll get to a couple stories here, but I do wanna do
3438720	3443160	a quick housekeeping. Next week on the show, you don't even know this, Loki, surprise,
3443160	3447920	Gabe's gonna be back next week to talk about SacIGDA and the Sac Indie Arcade, I'm hoping
3447920	3451720	Bree's gonna come too, I don't know if they're both coming or just him, but obviously they're
3451720	3455440	both welcome, and who knows, maybe they'll bring another friend that's involved, but
3455440	3461840	we're gonna talk about the SacIGDA, Sac Indie Arcade, which is going to happen April 8th,
3461840	3465000	so it's coming up, it's less than two weeks away. I know, I've been looking forward to
3465000	3469680	it. So that's coming up, and VOG will be broadcasting all day that Saturday, I'll let you know the
3469680	3473740	times next week, because I'm not sure exactly when we'll start and when we'll end, but it's
3473740	3477580	at the same venue we did last time, and so we were able to broadcast AOK, because they
3477580	3482640	got us a wired, I remember we had to run a wire out a window and down, but we got a wired
3482640	3486120	connection there, so we were able to do the stream in OK, so I think we're in the exact
3486120	3489880	same place we were last year, so if you are local in the Sacramento area, check it out,
3489880	3493840	it's gonna be at the West Sacramento Convention Center on April 8th, so definitely come out
3493840	3496400	and check that out. That's gonna be a very busy day for me, because I'm hosting Rocky
3496400	3501800	Horror that night, and you know what's funny? The after-party to the whole thing is at Cafe
3501800	3505780	Colonial, the venue where the thing was at the first year, right? Now it's the after-party
3505780	3511240	is there. Well, that's right next door to where we're doing Rocky Horror. So, the producer
3511240	3516720	already knows, I'm gonna come on stage, tell my jokes, get things started, and then I'm
3516720	3521960	going next door to hang out while the movie's going, because I've seen the movie a million
3521960	3528000	times, so anyway, that'll be a fun day, April 8th. OK, let's do some news. Loki, at least
3528000	3530840	let's get one story here, and then we'll probably get Dark Soccer on the line here.
3530840	3535760	We can talk a little bit about the evil G, so GameStop is anticipating that there's gonna
3535760	3541560	be shortage problems this year as well for the Nintendo Switch, and even for the PlayStation
3541560	3546440	VR, so they're saying that the demand is incredibly strong for this, as soon as we get any in
3546440	3552320	our stores, it's out within hours. We anticipate we're gonna be chasing supply this entire
3552320	3557760	year. Of course, Nintendo has insisted that, no, they've got it worked out, but I guess
3557760	3563840	we'll have to see, and then of course, PlayStation VR. The PS4 levels, they're expecting that
3563840	3569280	for the Scorpio launch, that it's gonna be, anticipation's higher or equal to the PlayStation
3569280	3574980	4 levels, so that's gonna be a problem too once that comes out. The other thing, which
3574980	3579540	is kind of interesting, I guess GameStop's not doing all that well, or at least as well
3579540	3587420	as they had hoped. They had a week, or holiday sales, so they're anticipating with that,
3587420	3595180	that they're gonna be closing 150 stores across the US. So yeah, they dropped, the hardware
3595180	3603900	sales dropped about 29%, and software down 19% as well, and I think a lot of that has
3603900	3607820	to do with people buying digitally also. That probably has got to at least account
3607820	3608820	for some of it.
3608820	3613620	Well, it might also be some of the same retail stuff that's, you know what's interesting?
3613620	3617300	I think on the show last week, I said something about how Sears and Kmart was gonna be the
3617300	3621100	next thing to go away, and then did you know during last week, there was actually a story
3621100	3626220	that came out that was like, Sears doesn't know if it actually came out that Sears said,
3626220	3628740	we don't know if we're still gonna be here in a few years. They said something along
3628740	3632940	those lines that made the investors freak out. So it was just kind of interesting that
3632940	3637380	like, wow, I need to keep my mouth shut on OLR sometimes. But anyway, I wonder if some
3637380	3641800	of that isn't coming into play too. Just more people are turning to online. Some of it digital,
3641800	3642800	some of it Amazon.
3642800	3646220	Some of it like Amazon, exactly. Especially when you get this bullshit where you pre-order
3646220	3651780	something and you want it, and you can't get it from them because they're out of it. Especially
3651780	3657380	now Amazon's doing a lot of that Amazon Now, the Prime Now stuff, where if I wanted a Switch
3657380	3662180	and they happen to have it, I could order it and it'd be to my house in a couple hours
3662180	3669680	versus having to order it through GameStopper pre-order, whatever the case may be. But also
3669680	3675580	I think too, some of that is probably even hardware sales too. Like with the PlayStation
3675580	3682820	4 Pro coming out, people anticipating the Switch coming out, PlayStation VR coming out.
3682820	3686540	A lot of people probably weren't picking up as many games because they just dropped $400
3686540	3692120	on a new system. So that probably plays into it somewhat as well.
3692120	3696400	Do you think the GameStop's days are limited? Because I feel like we've seen this coming
3696400	3697400	for a while now.
3697400	3702280	No, because you've got to have a channel for someone to sell hardware and all the other
3702280	3707920	stuff that digitally is just not going to work out. And also sometimes you can get better
3707920	3713680	deals there, especially with Nintendo, for example, not dropping the price of their games.
3713680	3717360	You may end up finding new stuff. They do have their place and they've also started
3717360	3721880	to see the writing on the wall a little bit and they're diversifying a lot more. So you're
3721880	3728620	seeing them get into more of like the toys and like hobby stuff, toys and apparel stuff.
3728620	3733280	So they are aware that they need to have more higher margin. That's the whole reasons they're
3733280	3739160	getting in higher margin items that are going to offset the drop in sales a little bit.
3739160	3743800	But they're always going to have, for one, they're still the biggest player in this.
3743800	3748240	And they're of course going to make sure that they're going to stay the biggest player by,
3748240	3753280	they have good control over these publishers. They fucking listen to when GameStop wants
3753280	3757280	them to do something. So until we get to that point where the publisher is like, well, we
3757280	3760440	don't need you anymore, but they do. So that's not going to ever happen.
3760440	3765380	Plus I imagine the used thing still does very well for GameStop because nobody else really
3765380	3769720	gets into that the same way, right? I mean, like I know others have tried. I know Best
3769720	3773840	Buy has tried. Amazon has a thing, but you know, when you think of buying used games,
3773840	3777960	you don't really think of Amazon, to be honest. Like I don't, can you even get used games?
3777960	3779680	I know you can trade them in, but what happens to them?
3779680	3784240	You can buy used games from Amazon. See, I just, I, I think people think more
3784240	3788520	about GameStop. I think GameStop still has done well in, in controlling that conversation
3788520	3794320	for better or for worse. The GameStop's credit, you with used games,
3794320	3798440	you kind of know what you're getting from when you go there. Like you, when you're buying
3798440	3802660	something on eBay or Amazon or something like that, you're not entirely sure what the quality
3802660	3806500	is going to be. I mean, they may have pictures and stuff, but at least with like GameStop,
3806500	3810420	you see the disc right in front of you. You can tell, okay, this looks like shit or, you
3810420	3815420	know, this is a bad condition. I mean, you kind of have that. Plus they have the quick,
3815420	3819260	you know, seven day warranty thing on it. So like if it does end up not working, I've
3819260	3824420	had that happen. You just take it right back and exchange it out without the hassle. So
3824420	3827180	I think it's a little bit more convenient in that sense, but yeah, I mean, there's other
3827180	3830740	places you're going to be able to find deals all over the place.
3830740	3833820	Now Bobby Black Wolf is pointing out in her chat room over at live.vognetwork.com that
3833820	3838300	Walmart is the biggest player and the evil G doesn't come close when it comes to, you
3838300	3841460	know, who's selling the games. I could, I could definitely see that, you know, depends
3841460	3844980	on your part of the country. See living here in California, we probably don't think of
3844980	3849080	that as much, even though Walmart's a big player here, it's probably something that's
3849080	3850580	much more apparent in other parts of the country.
3850580	3854540	They're a big retail player, but I think game wise, I think that they're doing more business
3854540	3856540	through GameStop. Really?
3856540	3860180	At least there was when I was working in the distribution business.
3860180	3864740	I was like, you got any receipts to back that up? Cause that's, even I'm having a hard time
3864740	3865740	doing that.
3865740	3869460	I can only, I can only go by what, what the reps said at the time. So then again, that
3869460	3871500	was three years ago. So who knows?
3871500	3876020	What is it? I will say this. It is, it is interesting. I would also believe that Walmart
3876020	3878940	is probably a bigger player than GameStop at the end of the day for what it's worth.
3878940	3883540	But it is interesting to me that most of the GameStops around here, if they're not in the
3883540	3885180	mall or in a Walmart parking lot.
3885420	3886420	Well, isn't that weird?
3886420	3890260	It is weird. Yeah. But the other thing too, let me look at like, if you want to talk about
3890260	3894460	who's the big players, I mean, look at, you know, who's getting exclusive DLC. It was
3894460	3900100	Walmart getting exclusive DLC or GameStop getting exclusive DLC. I mean, so that
3900100	3903420	Walmart gets a thing here and there, but okay. GameStop does get more.
3903420	3907340	They get quite a bit more and it's because they do a lot more marketing push for these
3907340	3912060	games as well. And a lot of people, I mean, they, people will go to Walmart, but they're
3912060	3916500	not going to necessarily, I don't think too many people are pre-ordering physically through
3916500	3920860	Walmart. Some people will. I mean, it usually, if they say that Walmart still does midnight
3920860	3924380	sales and stuff and does, I mean, so does Target. So does, you know, it just depends.
3924380	3929860	I think people now are starting to not necessarily rely as heavily on GameStop. They realize
3929860	3936180	that like, Oh, internet, I can, I can shop around now and it's a lot easier to shop around.
3936180	3938180	I think that's kind of what's hurting them more.
3938300	3943460	Well, Walmart certainly killed music stores and that, I mean, piracy really killed music
3943460	3949260	stores, but Walmart also had a huge hand in that too. So it's, it's interesting that GameStop
3949260	3955820	has persevered where a place like Tower Records or The Warehouse or whatever, you know,
3955820	3962260	music stores you can think of did not. So anyway, I do want to make sure we get to Dark
3962260	3966580	Sakura because she's patiently awaiting our call. So we're going to get her on the line
3966620	3970140	here and you can give us a call a little later in the show, but we're going to give Dark
3970140	3973940	Sakura's telephone a ring right now and get her on the show to check in with her. Cause
3973940	3977940	I know y'all are dying to hear her thoughts on Mass Effect Andromeda, as well as get into
3977940	3982420	the classic game of the week for tonight. And I'm hoping that she's near her phone cause
3982420	3986940	I'm about to get her voicemail. Even though I just checked in with her. All right, that
3986940	3993500	is bad. Cause she's not standing by your phone. Live radio. What can you do? Loki, you got
3993500	3997180	something short you can help fill time with here? Yeah, we can talk about the new classic
3997180	4003940	game of the week Halo. You bet that that's going to be your ass next week. So Nintendo
4003940	4010860	or I should say Reggie is promising that Nintendo is going to have a big E3 this year. And of
4010860	4016980	course his PR spin. E3 is always a big time for Nintendo. We look at each E3 as a unique
4016980	4021140	opportunity to tell our story. We're going to have a big E3 this year. We're showcasing
4021140	4026500	a variety of games, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, and some secrets
4026500	4035300	and 3DS. Yeah. This was an interview they had with Fox News. Are they going to do a
4035300	4040980	press conference thingy again? Probably. They're, they're not going to be, um, I don't think
4040980	4045300	they're actually, well, I mean, they didn't really say they're going to have a press conference,
4045300	4051300	but I think they're probably going to do the directs. So, I don't know. I know E3 or
4051300	4055980	EA is not going to be at E3 again. They're going to be doing their little, like we're,
4055980	4059860	we're doing E3, but at the same time as E3, but not really at E3. Oh, is that what they're
4059860	4064620	playing this year? That's what they're doing. Um, as I alluded to earlier in the show, when
4064620	4069300	I made fun of Mass Effect Andromeda, I was saying that this was actually coming from
4069300	4074740	Nintendo. So there's been some issue with Joy-Cons and they're having some issues, not
4074740	4080780	syncing or disconnecting because of some manufacturing variations, as Nintendo puts
4080780	4088080	it. So people have found, um, you know, that when they've come back being fixed from Nintendo,
4088080	4092420	that now they're adding this like piece of conductive foam in there that's supposed to
4092420	4097340	help with the signal or something like that. But yeah, they said there's no issue or no
4097340	4103300	design issue with the Joy-Con controllers and no widespread, um, proactive repair or
4103300	4109060	replacement effort is underway. And manufacturing variation has resulted in wireless interference
4109060	4114860	with a small number of left Joy-Cons. Moving forward, this will not be an issue as manufacturing
4114860	4118580	variation has been addressed.
4118580	4123100	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com,
4123100	4126220	use the passphrase, black.
4126220	4129180	Let me, uh, I hate to do this. I got to do it. There's no other way I can do this to
4129180	4133620	do this live. She's saying it's not ringing for her, um, for some reason. So I'm just
4133620	4136060	making sure that our phone is actually working. So what I'm doing right now is I'm actually
4136060	4141900	calling my own cell phone here, live on air. Okay. It's ringing. So I know I can call out.
4141900	4145600	So we're going to, we're going to try to do this again. That was my cell phone. So let's
4145600	4150180	try this one more time with Dark Sakura. Maybe she was trying to call us as we were calling
4150180	4156260	her, but we're going to see if it rings now. It's not even okay. There it is. What are
4156260	4161540	you eating? And I think, hello, hi, dark soccer. There you are. It rained this time.
4161540	4165340	There you go. Yeah, it's weird. We're having phone problems, but, uh, hooray. You're here.
4165340	4172940	How are you? How are you feeling? Um, I hurt, but I'm okay. Usually hanging in there. Yeah,
4172940	4179160	I, uh, I don't recommend to anybody to get kidney stones. Just don't do it. I'm not sure
4179160	4183260	it's something that'll just sound device in your house. I don't think, uh, you, you really
4183260	4189080	get a choice in the matter usually. Well, yeah, that's true, but it's the worst pain
4189080	4195440	I've ever felt in my life. Well, feel better. I hope, uh, I hope everything passes with
4195440	4203960	minimal pain. Um, so, uh, at the top of the show. Okay. So we spent like 45 minutes talking
4203960	4207380	about mass effect and drama tonight. And by the way, dark soccer, I hope you can hear
4207380	4210580	the show at some point. I think it'd be very proud of Loki tonight. Some of the things
4210580	4214820	he said, but anyway, I'll leave it at that. But the, uh, our listenership is dying to
4214820	4219240	know what are your thoughts early on with mass effect Andromeda? I'm pretty happy with
4219240	4225700	it actually. Although the character creation is derp, tastic, and I'm waiting for the modders
4225700	4233640	to step up their game. Um, for the most part, I really enjoyed all the characters. Um, there
4233640	4239640	just been certain things that I've rolled my eyes at just, you know, in game stuff that
4240080	4244940	one would know as a person living in their universe. I'm like, well, this isn't revisionist
4244940	4251940	history. Um, I, I was kind of thinking of going after the Turian lady, but I don't know.
4251940	4257940	She's a little bit more bestie and, you know, I don't want to do like a Garrett's replacement.
4257940	4263540	So, uh, it's, but she's been cool. She's been like her and Drack are my favorite characters
4263540	4269180	so far. So I like the Turian and the Krogan. All right. Good, good. What about one thing
4269180	4272320	we spent a lot of time talking about where some of the bugs that are going on with the
4272320	4276160	game, are you, are you encountering, are you encountering bugs? Is it, I mean, you mentioned
4276160	4279360	the character creators kind of derpy, but are you, are you running into bugs that are
4279360	4286360	ruining it for you? I actually had to adjust my, um, my, uh, graphic settings a few times,
4287120	4291440	um, because it would like freeze in certain parts of the dialogue and then the mouse would
4291440	4298440	keep moving. So I was getting that issue happening, um, and a little bit of jerkiness. Weird.
4298860	4305140	But um, you know, and there, there actually were a few, um, I wouldn't call it a bug,
4305140	4311740	but it's just a weird animation issue as like if you go up to talk to a character and you
4311740	4315780	approach them at just the wrong angle, of course the camera tries to move over your
4315780	4320620	shoulder and then you just got the character there continuing whatever animation they were
4320620	4325460	doing beforehand, you know, or whatever cycle of animation, instead of having them just
4325480	4332480	turn and talk to you. So it's like, I'm talking to you, but I'm also scanning this thing and
4332480	4337920	doing an interpretive dance. Yeah. So there's, that's sort of how it came out. There's some
4337920	4341480	weird things that maybe if it, maybe if they'd waited just a little longer to release the
4341480	4344800	game, they could have, um, worked out, but then we would have had to wait longer to play
4344800	4349160	the game. So I don't know. I would have been fine with that. Yeah. All right. That's, that's
4349160	4353440	fair. I think, uh, and a lot of people in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com
4353440	4357780	have been invoking the good old Miyamoto quote in our chat room about how a bad game
4357780	4363340	is bad forever, but a good game. Nobody remembers that it gets delayed. Just like Zelda people,
4363340	4368260	you know, that game was supposed to be out. I think originally it was like a holiday 2015
4368260	4372620	game, wasn't it? And then they pushed it back several times. Yeah. To make it, to make it
4372620	4377500	happen. But now nobody cares cause Zelda's awesome. Well, we've seen both of the endings
4377500	4382900	for that now. Yeah. It was good. Yeah, it was pretty good. I mean, you've got to get
4382900	4387800	all of the memories and a few other things to get like the true ending. But one thing
4387800	4392000	that disappointed me about that is that I was kind of under the impression that after
4392000	4397240	you beat the games and you've got more game, you know, like, like post end game stuff.
4397240	4401860	Um, and instead it doesn't quite work out that way, which I would have liked to have
4401860	4407680	like the whole post game rebuilding Hyrule thing, but it's not meant to be. Maybe that's
4407680	4413120	the DLC. We'll see. Maybe. See, that was, it was the whole existence of DLC is what
4413120	4418700	made me think that might be it, but oh well. All right. Well, we're going to, we're going
4418700	4424700	to go back to a more classic time when there wasn't any DLC. You know what? The game came
4424700	4429860	out and it is what it is. Either you like it or you don't. It's the classic game. And
4429860	4436360	then you had to go stand in line to do a return and then find your receipt. Uh, dark soccer
4436420	4440140	is going to jump into the gaming vault and find a game that she thinks, Hey, you guys
4440140	4445480	should be playing this game this week. If you don't, you are ignorant and you've picked.
4445480	4449360	I, this is one of those games this week where I'm like, this is a 10 year old game. Yes,
4449360	4454720	of course it is. Oh my gosh. I can't believe this qualifies 11 year old game. All right.
4454720	4458040	Dark soccer. What is the classic? And it is a classic. What is the classic game of the
4458040	4465040	week? Cooking mama. I decided to pick cooking mama and part of this, I am actually going
4466400	4472840	to say thank you to Game Tim who I found on YouTube who does the cooking with cooking
4472840	4479840	mama and we have chatted a little bit back and forth on Twitter and I would like to welcome
4480480	4485520	them as a listener to the show. So thank you for listening to us. Um, love to have them
4485520	4490660	on the show, but going back into the game, uh, it is cooking mama, which came out in
4490660	4497660	Japan on March 23rd, 2006 and in North America, September 12th, 2006. Sorry, my voice is still
4499420	4504900	a little icky today. Um, it was published by Taiko, um, in Japan, in the U S it was
4504900	4511900	by Majesco and, and how regions five Oh five games. It was awarded IDN's best of E3 award
4513420	4520420	for 2006. You want to know what's funny? We were at 2006, um, E3. We were, that was the
4521100	4526700	Paris Hilton year. Oh yeah, that's, that's brilliant. We started on that and we call,
4526700	4532820	we call it that because we had to walk a completely different direction because Paris Hilton was
4532820	4537580	at the booth and heaven forbid we get too close to a celebrity we don't give a fuck
4537580	4543060	about and it was like, Hey, I did meet John Cena and that was cool. We were walking like
4543060	4547260	behind and it wasn't like it was like we were walking behind a wall where she might've been
4547260	4550380	on the other side. It was so frustrating, but it was also more people are remembered
4550420	4555420	as the year that we was unveiled the last big year before the airport years. But anyway,
4555420	4562420	yes. Well anyway, in cooking mama as one might guess it has to do with cooking. Basically
4562660	4568860	follow the instructions that mama gives you. Um, you use your stylus on the 3DS to do different
4568860	4575300	tasks. Like you could chop the vegetables and slice meat or flip food or even down to
4575340	4581340	your plating of your food. So that's, I mean, I thought that didn't touch as well, but you've
4581340	4587740	also have kind of mundane tasks like pouring the water and things like that. And it's got
4587740	4594740	different recipes that you can make as well. Um, in fact, some of the mechanics and the
4595060	4599580	little mini games kind of make me think of how music games go, like where they have you
4599580	4606580	do things a certain way or cut across a certain way, kind of like, um, um, you know, where
4609580	4616580	it moves across the screen a certain way. So it's got kind of that in there too, but
4616580	4623580	now you can, with the 3DS, you actually have to use the first part of the screen to show
4624340	4630260	you your instructions for doing what you have to do on the bottom screen. So if you screw
4630260	4637060	up or if the time expires without making enough progress, then it's considered a failure.
4637060	4642980	And then you get mama pissed off with the caption that says, don't worry, mama will
4642980	4649980	fix it. And basically as you perform each of the tasks in the mini games, your performance
4650700	4657700	is rated by the time you get to the end of that level. And you can make all kinds of
4657700	4662700	interesting dishes in the game. Now, the let's cook part, honestly, I think I like the food
4662700	4669700	prep part better than the let's cook part just because, um, the cooking part is, it
4670700	4674700	seems a little subjective and it doesn't always make sense to me. Like, turn it down, turn
4674700	4677700	it up, turn it down, turn it up. Like, make up your mind. You're supposed to do it all
4678700	4685700	at certain times anyway. And like, some of the ingredients are kind of bizarre to me,
4686700	4692700	but hey, it is what it is. Like, I don't put cucumbers on a sandwich. Um, and then you
4692700	4698700	can, um, you know, basically it's just all these different modes in that you combine
4698700	4703700	things, you cook things, you chop things, like bring skills like peeling and stewing
4703700	4709700	and all of that. And some of the dishes in the game, honestly enough, are really pretty
4709700	4716700	good. Um, I may or may not have used a couple of inspirations in the past, although I'll
4717700	4724700	be honest, I've gone back and looked up other recipes myself. So, um, Cooking Mama was actually
4724700	4731700	considered kind of average, um, when it released. Um, Famitsu gave it a 28 out of 40. Um, it
4732700	4738700	was, though, considered to be a great title for being a budget title. Um, it was $20 at
4738700	4745700	release, it was pretty inexpensive and a very solid and replayable game. Um, and it really
4746700	4751700	is something that you can sit down and play casually. Like, you can do a few recipes here
4751700	4757700	and then save it, and then do a few recipes other and save it. So, um, the first game
4757700	4763700	Cooking Mama made, uh, they actually sold over 500,000 copies in the US, and, um, that's
4764700	4771700	as of August 15th, 2007, and over a million in the TAO regions. So, um, and believe it
4772700	4776700	or not, Miley Cyrus was a big fan of the series. She came in like a Cooking Mama.
4777700	4778700	That's so random.
4779700	4783700	Now, here's the fun thing. You remember, cause we even made fun of this on the show, when
4784700	4785700	PETA had their, their panties in a bunch over it.
4785700	4786700	Yes, I do remember that.
4787700	4794700	It was Cooking Mama, Mama kills animals. And so, the press release response was hilarious.
4795700	4801700	It's Mama saying, I would never put rat in my ratatouille, and pointed out the vegetarian
4802700	4807700	recipes. And then PETA kinda got their panties unplifted when Gardening Mama came out.
4808700	4810700	So, I know, right?
4811700	4812700	It's funny.
4812700	4819700	So, there, there were sequels. Um, one of, um, one of them was Cooking Mama Cook-Off.
4820700	4824700	It came out, um, for the Wii, and it used the Wiimote for the cooking, kinda like how
4825700	4828700	the, uh, the surgery, the surgery game, by the way, stopped using the Wiimote, I'm just
4829700	4834700	saying. And then we got another DS game, which is Cooking Mama to Dinner with Friends.
4835700	4840700	And it has, like, different mini-games and other modes. On top of that, it has Mama speaking
4840700	4846700	with a very, very thick accent. So, um, there's also Cooking Mama World Kitchen for Wii.
4847700	4853700	Um, and then there is another DS sequel, Cooking Mama 3 Stop and Chop, um, that came out, um,
4854700	4859700	in October 2009. Uh, Mama has been in other games too, like Babysitting Mama. Did you see
4860700	4861700	that baby thing that comes with it? It's creepy.
4862700	4863700	Yeah, it's super creepy.
4864700	4866700	And then Crafty Mama, Gardening Mama.
4867700	4869700	Where she teaches you, she teaches you how to cook crack.
4870700	4877700	And then Gardening Mama 2, Forest Friends. There is also Cooking Mama 4, Kitchen Magic
4878700	4884700	for the 3DS, and Cooking Mama 5, Bon Appetit. And there's also kind of a pseudo-sequel called
4885700	4892700	Cooking Mama Sweet Shop that was on the 3DS as well. Um, now, what I would like to stop
4893700	4900700	and reference for a moment is that it, believe it or not, it kind of has gameplay items in
4901700	4908700	common with a Super Nintendo era game. And that game was called, um, Multiple-Chan No
4910700	4915700	Wonder Kitchen. And I had to bring this up because I actually have played a little bit
4916700	4921700	of this game. I had it on an emulator way back in the day and I was like, eh, it's cute.
4922700	4927700	Basically, Multiple-Chan No Wonder Kitchen, um, was one of those advertising games, you
4928700	4935700	know, like how Joki Doki Panic was and all that. It was sponsored by, um, Aji no Moto,
4936700	4942700	um, the company that does, like, they sell, like, MSD additive and, and like some brands
4943700	4948700	of dashi. They're basically kitchen, uh, condiments. And this game came out in 1993 for the
4948700	4954700	Super Famicom. It was cut in, uh, sorry, point and click. And you even got, like, seals
4955700	4960700	for their brand of mayonnaise or something to get the game. Um, but the cooking aspect
4961700	4966700	of the game, the meal preparation is more than a little bit similar to Cooking Mama
4967700	4971700	and it makes me think that that was where the idea for Cooking Mama came from, if that
4972700	4977700	makes sense. Yeah. Now, I'm trying to find some of the Cooking Mama recipes so I can
4978700	4984700	tell you what's in there because it actually, it's fairly international. Um, I, I will say
4985700	4992700	from all of the, um, uh, watching Cooking with Dog and, uh, you know, just my own hunt
4993700	5003700	down of recipes and what I know about Japanese cooking is that, um, it, um, really is very
5003700	5009700	still, I'd say, Japanese oriented for the style of cooking and ingredients. Um, but
5010700	5014700	I was trying, hopefully trying to find some of the, the recipes in it. Like, I know that
5015700	5023700	you can do Salisbury steak or potato salad or, um, pizza. Um, and then of course there's,
5024700	5030700	uh, okonomiyaki I think was one. You can do instant ramen. But, but the best part, the
5030700	5036700	best part Dark Saga is when you fuck up the food, what happens? Mama has to fix it. Don't
5037700	5043700	worry, Mama will fix it. Exactly right. Ok, so here's, here's some of the other episodes
5044700	5048700	in here. So you can do, um, ogakodon in there, which is like one of my favorite ever Japanese
5049700	5055700	dishes. Although it calls it chicken and egg rice bowl. You have, uh, chicken and tomato
5055700	5062700	sauce. You have wontons, you have soba, uh, agidashi doku is in it. You get a US one.
5063700	5067700	So there's all kinds of stuff. It's really great. And yeah, but, but can Mama fix my
5068700	5074700	life? Cause it's pretty broken. I don't think your life is broken. Tiny Mama. You did even
5075700	5082700	better than Mama. That's very sweet of you to say. It doesn't affect it when. Alright.
5083700	5088700	You give me Mama to fix America. Anything else to say about Cookie Mama, the game of
5089700	5094700	the week? I am super hungry and I'm actually going to be making something tonight in my
5095700	5099700	kitchen. There, oh, well, and if you fuck it up, don't worry, Dan will have to clean
5100700	5107700	it up. Dan will fix it. No, I'm a good cook. I'm making, um, uh, nut bread. Mmm, yummy.
5107700	5111700	We'll save some for next week. We have guests here in studio next week, so save some. We'll
5112700	5116700	see about, we'll see about that. Alright. Alright, well, uh, Dark Saga is joining us
5117700	5121700	and that was the classic game of the week, Cooking Mama, um, available on the 3DS, which
5122700	5125700	I'm sure a lot of you guys have played. If you haven't, you should go check it out and
5126700	5130700	don't worry if you fuck it up, Mama will fix it. One last little thing that I think is
5131700	5135700	worth mentioning. You know that, um, uh, ragtime piano player whose site reads video game
5135700	5141700	music? Yeah. There's one of him doing the Cooking Mama theme. Oh, that's funny. Yeah,
5142700	5144700	cause you can kind of hear that in the background. It's really cool. It's like a ragtime piano
5145700	5150700	theme that plays during the whole game. Exactly, so it's, it's, and once he starts doing improvisation
5151700	5155700	it's amazing, but I think that's worth a listen as well. Very cool. Alright, well, Dark
5156700	5158700	Saga, I'm going to let you go so we can get to break, but, uh, feel better, okay, and
5159700	5163700	then, uh, have fun cooking tonight. Thank you, have fun breaking things. We will, bye.
5163700	5167700	Alright, we're going to go ahead and take a break. Uh, when we come back though, with
5168700	5171700	more of Orange Lounge Radio, lots more news because we barely scratched the surface on
5172700	5174700	news, right? So we have a lot more news to come up. Yes. When we come back to the show
5175700	5179700	and of course your calls as well, uh, over Orange Lounge Radio on Skype and we will get
5180700	5182700	to the mailbag as well. I know we have at least one email we got to get to tonight.
5183700	5185700	There might've been more too, so we'll get to all that when we come back after this break
5186700	5187700	with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
5187700	5199700	And welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio. Live tonight, episode number 681 for
5200700	5206700	March 26th of 2017. If you're just joining us over at VOG Network, you missed a fun little
5207700	5210700	spirited discussion about Mass Effect Andromeda at the beginning of the show and talking
5211700	5214700	about some other games from this week. Talking a little bit about Nintendo needing to amp
5214700	5218700	up supplies to the Switch and some of the things the GameStop's going through this week.
5219700	5223700	But we've got some more news to come, right, Loki? Yes we do. So we can talk a little bit
5224700	5228700	about rumors because everybody loves rumors. Yay! Rumor has it. And these are all, these
5229700	5233700	are all Activision rumors. Oh boy. So, uh, the first one, which actually I believe did
5234700	5237700	get confirmed, was that Destiny 2 was supposed to be out in September. When we say got
5238700	5241700	confirmed, like Activision said? I want to say I saw on Twitter there was someone that
5241700	5247700	was in the know, I can't remember who it was, this was a while ago, I saw this on,
5248700	5252700	someone saw, it was a poster that got leaked out there, and then there was someone that
5253700	5262700	did confirm. Way to ruin E3. There was going to be an announcement. So, yeah, interesting.
5263700	5268700	So Destiny 2, that'll be something we can hopefully expect this year. So in September.
5268700	5272700	In September. Cool. And this is according to a poster. And that's the whole, we knew
5273700	5275700	it was coming because they had that whole discussion about that you can't transfer your
5276700	5279700	characters, anything besides like cosmetic stuff. And we knew it was coming this year
5280700	5283700	because they did announce that it was coming in the fall. Yeah. So, I mean, it makes sense
5284700	5290700	because Destiny 1 came out in September, so, sure. But that was, god, almost three, four
5291700	5294700	years ago at this point, right? Has it been that long? It has been a little while. It's
5294700	5298700	been over a year, probably three years ago. Probably three years ago. The other rumor
5299700	5306700	is another also promotional piece, and this is a promotional poster or something for Call
5307700	5314700	of Duty World War II. So kind of saying that this would take Call of Duty back to its roots,
5315700	5321700	so kind of pulling a fucking, you know, EA and Battlefield 1, you know, now let's take
5321700	5326700	it back because our modern or future warfare shit just ain't flying. Let's just take it
5327700	5330700	back to modern warfare. Let's just go back to our roots. Just go back to modern warfare,
5331700	5334700	just do a modern warfare four. Let's just go back and punch some Nazis in the face.
5335700	5341700	And just do it. World War II, Call of Duty was still fun, so I'm down to check that out.
5342700	5346700	I do like the modern warfare games, though, because I got spoiled after I played, you
5346700	5351700	know, the old ones, so we'll see. I'm curious. Stoppy in chat says, I do miss World War II
5352700	5355700	shooters. So there you go. Yeah, and everyone was sick of them for a while. It just proves
5356700	5361700	you got to, like, give it some time, you know, space that shit out. All right. Some other
5362700	5365700	stuff we can talk about. Let's talk about Sony. So there's another rumor coming out
5366700	5370700	that they're prepping yet another revision of the PlayStation 4. So apparently there's
5370700	5375700	going to be an even slimmer model that's going to be coming out. And this is coming
5376700	5382700	from Digitimes saying that they're prepping a thinner version of the PlayStation 4. This
5383700	5387700	is not unlike Sony because they did revisions on the PlayStation 2 and 3 a few times.
5388700	5391700	I know three went through at least two revisions and even Microsoft did the same thing
5392700	5397700	with the Xbox 360. So it makes sense. What I what I would be curious about would be
5397700	5402700	would this slimmer version get the pro specs? Could this be a slim pro? Or is the
5404700	5409700	PlayStation Pro kind of like it's already over? But okay. Now, one thing I know we
5410700	5412700	talked a lot about Mass Effect Andromeda at the beginning of the show. But one thing,
5413700	5416700	you know, I need to mention some positives, you know, because I talk about the story
5417700	5420700	still really good, the exploration. But one of the other like big positives is that
5421700	5425700	it's really gorgeous. Like a lot of the scenery that you go through and the backgrounds
5425700	5429700	I mean, it's like when you're in some of these vaults that you go into is fucking
5430700	5434700	gorgeous. And yeah, I've been playing this on a PlayStation 4 Pro. Granted, I don't
5435700	5438700	have a 4K TV. So yeah, I don't know why I own a pro either. I guess I was hoping to
5439700	5443700	get those increased frame rates. But for what it's worth in Andromeda, it's been a
5444700	5447700	smooth experience, even though, you know, there's been some of those bugs that we
5448700	5452700	talked about, like everything still renders really smooth and so forth. So I'm kind
5452700	5457700	of curious if maybe if PlayStation is going to slim things down again, might the
5458700	5461700	pro specs be a new standard, especially if this is something that's going to happen
5462700	5465700	towards the end of the year? You know, the price of the technology should have come
5466700	5472700	down, right? I would hope, yeah. It'll be interesting to see. Yeah. Let's talk about
5473700	5478700	Blizzard, I should say. It's also sort of Activision. Sort of. So they got this whole
5478700	5483700	remaster of Starcraft coming out this summer. So I haven't actually heard about
5484700	5487700	this yet, but apparently the remastered version is going to include all the same
5488700	5492700	content from the original game, including the Brood War expansion. And they're
5493700	5498700	going to give it a graphical overhaul with 4K Ultra HD updated audio and matchmaking
5499700	5503700	support. And they're saying that they are also doing new illustrations to enhance
5503700	5509700	the storytelling during the camping missions and cloud saves and custom made maps
5510700	5514700	and key binds and all that fun stuff. You know, this was rumored during the last
5515700	5518700	BlizzCon, which was a little bit, you know, it was kind of a lackluster BlizzCon.
5519700	5522700	They didn't really announce a lot of big, big stuff besides what the Overwatch League,
5523700	5526700	which we still don't even know much about, the Diablo Necromancer when everybody
5527700	5532700	wanted an expansion or Diablo 4. But anyway, so the Starcraft remaster was
5533700	5536700	rumored a few months ago. It's interesting. They chose to announce it now. I
5537700	5540700	understand there was a, there was an event in Korea that they did this at, right?
5541700	5543700	There's like an I heart Starcraft thing. And there's another cool thing too, is
5544700	5548700	like with Brood War, they're also patching that they're doing an update. 1.18 is
5549700	5553700	going to actually add some more bug features, improvements, and even observer
5554700	5557700	mode and the ability to rebind keys. So that's something, even if you own the
5558700	5561700	game, like part of the Starcraft anthology or something like that, you can
5561700	5564700	actually download that and be able to update your game as well.
5565700	5568700	Yeah, well, Blizzard's been patching like their games like ten years after the
5569700	5572700	fact. Diablo 2 got a patch like a couple years ago. So, you know, it happens.
5573700	5578700	But you guys have to remember, Starcraft is still huge in many places. And, you
5579700	5581700	know, yes, Starcraft 2 is a thing. And yes, there's people that play that
5582700	5585700	instead. But the original Starcraft is still like huge. So it's a pretty big
5586700	5589700	deal for Blizzard to come out and say basically that we're not going to touch
5589700	5595700	anything with balance. This is just like a cosmetic overhaul and that's it.
5596700	5598700	Well, I guess there's also some things probably with the matchmaking and the
5599700	5603700	fact that it'll actually be integrated with, I keep wanting to say Battle Net,
5604700	5607700	but the Blizzard launcher, whatever the hell they're calling it now, Battle Net,
5608700	5610700	they're basically integrating it into the same system that used the Overwatch.
5611700	5616700	Battle Not. They Battle Not. Diablo 3 and World of Warcraft and all that use
5616700	5618700	this. So now you should be able to see your friends as they're playing the
5619700	5623700	original Starcraft should all be integrated into that. The HD version
5624700	5627700	anyway. But I don't know if you were going to get into this. So sorry if I'm
5628700	5631700	ruining something. But I believe I heard they're going to give away the original
5632700	5635700	Starcraft as part of this, right? Or like just in like the coming week or
5636700	5639700	something, you can actually get the old school Starcraft for free. Not the
5640700	5642700	redo. You'll have to pay for that. I don't know how much you're going to charge
5643700	5645700	for that. But if you've never gotten into Starcraft, you'll be able to get
5646700	5648700	the original in the expansion just for free. They're just going to give it away
5649700	5653700	even though they've sold it for 20 bucks. 20 bucks for a game from 1997 until now.
5654700	5656700	And now they're finally just going to make it free for everybody. So that part's
5657700	5662700	pretty cool. Yeah. Yeah. So, um, I'm, I'm fucking terrible at Starcraft, so I
5663700	5666700	don't know if anything's going to make me better. I do own Starcraft 2, but I
5667700	5670700	like all the arcade game things you can do in that. I don't, I'm terrible at the
5671700	5673700	game itself. When you watch the people that are good at that game, like they
5673700	5678700	have all of their key binds down. They're like building stuff like it's so fast.
5679700	5681700	Like the way people move in that game. It's just like, I can't, I can't operate
5682700	5685700	on that level. I just can't. So, but I think it's cool that they're remastering
5686700	5691700	the game. Yeah. Like not trying to reinvent the wheel, but like, Hey, this
5692700	5697700	game is still popular. Almost God, 20 years. We are here 20 years after the
5698700	5701700	fact, this game is still popular. So we're just gonna give it a new coat of
5701700	5705700	paint and that's it. We're not gonna fuck with what makes it still a loved
5706700	5709700	game all these years later. So, um, I want to make sure I throw in a story here
5710700	5713700	as well, because it's something that, uh, Jason had brought up in the intro to
5714700	5718700	the show tonight, uh, is that good old galaxy or GOG, uh, also got an upgrade
5719700	5723700	this week. GOG is, uh, up to version 1.2 of GOG galaxy, which is their front
5724700	5727700	end. If you haven't used enough GOG, it's kind of like the steam client, if you
5727700	5731700	will. God galaxy is their front end, which includes the store as well as the
5732700	5734700	games that you bought. Now, obviously God kind of started with a lot of the retro
5735700	5739700	stuff, but now they have a lot of more modern stuff, especially in the things, uh,
5740700	5743700	in the marketplace as well. Yeah. Um, well, one of the big perks about the new
5744700	5748700	version of God galaxy is that now there are universal cloud saves. Note this,
5749700	5753700	it doesn't matter which game you're using for any game on GOG. They don't have
5753700	5757700	to build an extra support for this. Galaxy 1.2 will let your saves be stored
5758700	5762700	and synced online. So my assumption is it must tell these games that you have
5763700	5765700	another drive on your computer that is actually located in the clouds. That's,
5766700	5768700	I haven't used it yet, but that's my assumption, how something like this must
5769700	5772700	work and work in every game is that it's putting a new cloud drive on your
5773700	5777700	computer where all this stuff can pretty much be saved. So, uh, and this is cool
5778700	5781700	because if you ever upgrade your PC, you won't lose your save files. They're all
5781700	5784700	right there. I'm assuming if you go to a friend's house and log in or something,
5785700	5789700	your cloud files will be right there. So, you know, GOG has to find ways to
5790700	5793700	differentiate itself from steam because steam is still kind of the behemoth there
5794700	5797700	and everybody flips the fuck out about steam sales, but not as many people flip
5798700	5802700	the fuck out about GOG sales except I appreciate the rage nator will call into
5803700	5805700	the show whenever there is a GOG sale, but you know what I mean? Like GOG has
5806700	5809700	its proponents, but it's far outnumbered by the number of people that are still
5809700	5813700	talking about steam. So, um, you know, GOG has to think of these other ways to
5814700	5818700	push themselves forward. Um, something else that galaxy is going to be doing in
5819700	5823700	1.2, there's a new in game overlay, so you can hit shift tab just like you can in
5824700	5827700	steam and it brings up an overlay so you can have a chat system, notifications,
5828700	5831700	achievements, and all that stuff. Also a screenshots now built in when you have
5832700	5836700	F12. Um, so that's pretty cool, which, you know, I hate to say it, but that is all
5836700	5839700	functionality that does exist within steam, but still good to try to bring, you
5840700	5843700	know, a little bit of parody and, and, you know, the other feature they said that
5844700	5847700	was a pretty major feature of 1.2 is that they're going to be allowing users to
5848700	5852700	that customize what galaxies features are. Um, so they can turn off things that
5853700	5857700	they don't want to unbloat the client basically. So they can, you know, um,
5858700	5861700	also they have like a hibernate mode that's going to drop CPU usage and
5861700	5865700	decrease battery life when you're, you know, getting mobiley or something like
5866700	5872700	that. An FPS counter, bandwidth limiter, screenshot capturing, achievement rarity,
5873700	5879700	stuff like that. Cool. Um, so, um, yeah, you can, uh, I think you have to be in
5880700	5883700	their little preview thing or opt into betas to actually see this now. I don't
5884700	5886700	think this rolls out for everybody till April, but I don't think they have a
5887700	5890700	closed beta thing like, like Xbox one does or anything. I think you just opt in
5891700	5894700	if you want to check it out. Although it might have bugs. So don't blame me if
5895700	5898700	there's bugs. All right. Uh, look, you have something else for us. Then maybe
5899700	5901700	we'll get to mailbag here soon. Yeah. We can talk about some of the Xbox one
5902700	5905700	updates. So Xbox one is going to be adding some tournament features with their
5906700	5910700	next update. So they're going to be adding support for ESL back tournaments in a
5911700	5915700	thing called arena. Um, I guess the world of tanks is going to be one of the
5916700	5920700	first games to support that. And you can join ranked matches and be notified of
5921700	5926700	tournament progress and see the results. And they're saying that also that, um,
5927700	5931700	along with that, they're going to add some more games to it later on. They're
5932700	5936700	also going to be adding the ability to upload custom gamer pics so you can put
5937700	5940700	your own gear picks on there now instead of just whatever they're offering you,
5941700	5945700	which is kind of nice. And then, um, they're saying though that that's not
5946700	5949700	going to be, they're going to be building that from your mobile phone or PC or
5949700	5953700	even console. Um, and there, I didn't really see how they're going to police
5954700	5958700	that. So if you see Dick pics on there and then, well, it's a work in progress.
5959700	5964700	Um, and then of course, uh, with that, they're allowing you to log into a wifi
5965700	5970700	network, uh, which needs browser for sign in authenticity. So you can actually,
5971700	5975700	you know, it'll pop up your browser within there if you need to do that.
5975700	5980700	So like you're at, you know, a school or something. Hmm. Yeah.
5982700	5986700	Um, and then of course also they're allowing you to filter your library via
5987700	5992700	Xbox 360 or Xbox one. You can pin items and to your activity feed and auto zoom
5993700	5995700	using connect when you're using Skype. That's good.
5996700	5999700	Cause my library on Xbox one's getting really bloated with all the Xbox 360
6000700	6001700	backwards compatibility and the games with gold.
6001700	6004700	Like there's a lot to scroll through. So I'm, I'm kind of glad they're,
6005700	6008700	they're changing that up a little bit. Yeah. Um, some other cool stuff.
6009700	6013700	There's some, some, they announced the games for games of gold for April.
6014700	6017700	So you're going to get rise on Xbox one for the whole month of April.
6018700	6023700	Um, and then I guess, uh, April 16th through May 15th,
6024700	6027700	you're going to get the walking dead season two on Xbox one.
6027700	6030700	And then on Xbox 360 for the first half of April,
6031700	6035700	Darksiders in the second half, Assassin's Creed revelations.
6036700	6039700	Um, cool. Let's see the rises on there. Yeah.
6040700	6042700	Rise was one of the launch titles, right? Yeah, it was. Yeah.
6043700	6046700	And then finally there is also some more backwards compatibility, um,
6047700	6051700	information including yes, including they have added backwards compatibility
6052700	6054700	support for Daytona USA.
6057700	6070700	I've been waiting to play that song for years. Years.
6071700	6076700	Always. We always need an excuse to do that. Um, so yeah, that's pretty awesome.
6077700	6081700	And so along with that, you can also, um, I guess stacking and tower blocks
6082700	6085700	deluxe was another, um, two titles that were added on there.
6085700	6088700	Who fucking cares? Daytona. Exactly. Daytona.
6089700	6091700	Sorry to the developers who worked very hard on those games,
6092700	6095700	but maybe if you included a really catchy theme songs, right?
6096700	6098700	That's right. Then, you know, exactly.
6099700	6100700	So you really only have yourselves a blame for that.
6103700	6104700	Uh, let's get to the mailbag.
6110700	6113700	Every week you guys email us participate at orange long trader.com
6113700	6116700	is the place to send your emails and we dive into the mailbag and pick
6117700	6120700	some emails to read here on the show. Uh, or in the case of this week,
6121700	6124700	we have one loan email to read on the show tonight, but it's a good one.
6125700	6127700	So I'm going to jump into that right now since dark soccer is not here.
6128700	6130700	I will, um, fulfill as, as the runner up at the pageant,
6131700	6133700	I will fulfill her duties, uh, as a queen of the show.
6134700	6137700	So, uh, participate at orange launch radio again,
6138700	6139700	if you want to send us an email for a future week.
6139700	6143700	Uh, but this email tonight comes to us from our pal James Nighthawk,
6144700	6146700	who says salutations from across the pond.
6147700	6148700	James Nighthawk here writing in from England.
6149700	6150700	I've been meaning to mail for a while, but as we know,
6151700	6152700	all know life gets in the way.
6153700	6156700	I'm writing to hopefully trigger further conversation about the services
6157700	6159700	provided on modern gaming consoles with some different perspectives
6160700	6161700	to stir into the mix.
6162700	6164700	You've recently been discussing the lack of streaming services
6165700	6166700	and apps available on launch for the Nintendo switch.
6166700	6168700	I agree with, or at least understand your arguments
6169700	6171700	for many of the points you have all raised.
6172700	6173700	However, I would like to offer some counterpoints.
6174700	6175700	Please note when reading this,
6176700	6177700	I'm not sure where I stand on this matter yet,
6178700	6179700	so this is all good debate from my perspective.
6180700	6183700	You mentioned that the landscape has changed since the launch days
6184700	6185700	of the 360 PlayStation 3 Wii era.
6186700	6189700	Netflix, YouTube, et al are now standard parts of our lives.
6190700	6192700	Whereas back in 2006, the consoles were not weaker
6193700	6194700	for lacking these services. This is true.
6194700	6196700	The addition of Netflix and so forth to these systems
6197700	6199700	arguably extended the lifespans of these consoles.
6200700	6203700	I for one know many people for whom the Wii was the Netflix machine
6204700	6206700	after the charm of Wii Sports started to wane.
6207700	6210700	However, I proffer that the landscape has changed further still.
6211700	6213700	Many televisions have built-in streaming services.
6214700	6217700	The likes of Roku, Amazon, Fire Stick, Apple TV, and so on
6218700	6220700	each offer cheap, quick methods for streaming.
6221700	6222700	Running a games console for Netflix
6222700	6225700	is arguably a needless use of electricity for many people
6226700	6228700	when a light device with a convenient remote control
6229700	6231700	or a built-in smart TV app does the job better.
6232700	6235700	Not to mention the phones, tablets, laptops, and so forth many of us have.
6236700	6238700	Let us consider the Kindle. No, not the Kindle Fire,
6239700	6240700	the humble Kindle. Kindle, the e-reader.
6241700	6243700	The Kindle of today does less than the older Kindles.
6244700	6246700	My first Kindle had an experimental browser.
6247700	6248700	The experiment, I can only assume,
6249700	6250700	was to see how long the average person would use it
6250700	6253700	before rolling their eyes, guffawing comically,
6254700	6256700	and grabbing any other device to browse the internet.
6257700	6259700	It was slow, monochrome, and unresponsive.
6260700	6262700	It was a concept, a bad concept, that went no further.
6263700	6265700	The Kindle does one thing. It does books, and it does books well.
6266700	6268700	When I read on my tablet, notifications tempt me away.
6269700	6271700	The ease of access to social media is omnipresent.
6272700	6273700	Distractions, distractions, distractions.
6274700	6277700	Equally, a tablet hasn't the right kind of screen for reading lengthy texts in bed,
6277700	6280700	nor are they light enough to hold in one hand for hours at a time.
6281700	6283700	The Kindle does one thing, and it does it well.
6284700	6285700	Now, on to Nintendo.
6286700	6287700	Like Rob, I've been thoroughly enjoying my Switch.
6288700	6289700	I enjoy the light nature of the OS.
6290700	6291700	It is snappy and simple, and when I'm using it,
6292700	6293700	I'm doing one thing. I'm gaming.
6294700	6295700	In an age where every device offers every service,
6296700	6298700	having certain devices do one thing well is refreshing.
6299700	6302700	Nintendo can't compete on gaming spec with Sony and Microsoft.
6303700	6305700	They can't compete on apps with Apple or Android.
6305700	6308700	What they do have in their corner are some of the most solid games in existence,
6309700	6311700	in a flexible form that is both portable and dockable.
6312700	6315700	By providing a simple, malleable gaming system that does nothing else,
6316700	6317700	they can be seen as focusing their energies.
6318700	6320700	I would like to reiterate, I'm not sure if this argument holds water.
6321700	6322700	It will be interesting to see what happens in the coming few years.
6323700	6324700	The iPhone killed the iPod.
6325700	6327700	But this is because, in terms of sound quality and convenience,
6328700	6329700	the iPhone made the iPod largely irrelevant.
6330700	6332700	The iPhone does not make console gaming irrelevant,
6333700	6334700	as touch gaming is no substitute for real controls.
6335700	6338700	Equally, the Xbox One and PlayStation 4 do not make the Switch irrelevant,
6339700	6341700	as they are not as flexible, nor do they have the Nintendo games.
6342700	6343700	Nintendo may be on to something here.
6344700	6348700	Choice is, yes, this is a long email, but it's good, so I'm going to read it all.
6349700	6350700	Choice is, of course, paramount.
6351700	6352700	Nintendo can offer Netflix, YouTube, and so on,
6353700	6354700	and I can choose not to use them.
6355700	6357700	But I do wonder how vital such apps are to the sales of the system.
6358700	6361700	Most Switch owners are likely swimming in app-laden devices already.
6361700	6364700	They purchase, or want to purchase, a Switch to play Nintendo games.
6365700	6369700	Indeed, for the last five years, Nintendo has arguably scared off potential customers.
6370700	6372700	Hear ye, hear ye, come play Nintendo's awesome games, they cry.
6373700	6375700	Buy a Wii U for our awesome games, they exclaim.
6376700	6379700	Oh, and a 3DS2 for other awesome games, they siren, louder still,
6380700	6383700	now with beads of sweat congealing on their collective brows.
6384700	6386700	In the end, many people chose to buy neither system,
6387700	6389700	baffled by the choice of hardware and the division of games.
6389700	6392700	The Switch is Nintendo's chance to rally Nintendo games
6393700	6395700	and Nintendo fans behind one system, a gaming system.
6396700	6400700	The rest is the cream on the, hopefully very tempting, piece of gadget pudding.
6401700	6403700	Thanks for reading, and I hope my English vernacular hasn't befuddled you
6404700	6405700	or your listeners too much.
6406700	6407700	P.S. Jamie, you might like this.
6408700	6410700	Well, she's not here tonight, but we'll try to enjoy it on her behalf.
6411700	6412700	Regarding your use of the word hysterical
6413700	6415700	when describing the internet dickheads threatening the EA worker last week,
6415700	6419700	the word hysterical is derived from the Latin hysteria, meaning womb.
6420700	6424700	Hysteria was originally defined as a neurotic condition peculiar to women
6425700	6427700	and thought to be caused by a dysfunction of the uterus.
6428700	6430700	A rather delicious linguistic irony there.
6431700	6432700	I am a fan of irony.
6433700	6435700	A good day to all, and to Jamie, resist.
6436700	6437700	James Nighthawk.
6438700	6439700	Wonderful email, thank you for sharing.
6440700	6441700	I'm sure Jamie would give you a gold star if she was here,
6442700	6443700	so I will give you a gold star in her steed.
6443700	6445700	I think you do bring up good points in your email,
6446700	6448700	but here's the one problem for me,
6449700	6451700	and I think the one thing that you overlooked in your examples
6452700	6453700	and the thing that I keep coming back to as to
6454700	6455700	why am I holding Nintendo to a different standard
6456700	6457700	with this whole Netflix thing.
6458700	6459700	Yes, your TVs can do it.
6460700	6461700	Yes, your phones can do it.
6462700	6465700	But what your TV can't do is come off of the television
6466700	6468700	and go into your pocket out the front door.
6469700	6470700	And that's something the Switch does.
6470700	6475700	And Nintendo has been selling the Switch for doing this for games,
6476700	6480700	which is cool, but not all the, for lack of a better term,
6481700	6482700	excuse me for this example,
6483700	6484700	not all of the soccer moms out there,
6485700	6487700	oh, excuse me, excuse me, football moms.
6488700	6489700	Gotta forget I'm speaking to somebody on the other side of the pond.
6490700	6493700	But all joking aside, we call them soccer moms here in the US.
6494700	6496700	So all the soccer moms out there probably aren't gonna get it
6497700	6499700	when it comes to games, but show them the moms.
6500700	6502700	Show them the movie, the Netflix on the TV that,
6503700	6506700	oh, gotta go sit in the doctor's office for this appointment.
6507700	6510700	Obviously you don't want to encourage people to watch TV when they drive.
6511700	6513700	So they're gonna have to kind of dance around that issue and that whole thing.
6514700	6515700	But, you know, they could, even with the kids,
6516700	6517700	the kids are watching a TV show and, oh,
6518700	6519700	we gotta get going to grandma's or whatever.
6520700	6522700	You can pick that show up right off the TV
6523700	6524700	and take it with you right on out to the car.
6525700	6528700	Now, although you may think right now with Netflix
6528700	6532700	that's not possible because Netflix requires an always stable internet connection,
6533700	6537700	remember a few months ago Netflix introduced the whole downloading things.
6538700	6540700	So there's no reason why you couldn't queue something up on the Switch
6541700	6543700	and as you watch it, the rest of the episode downloads.
6544700	6545700	So at a certain point while you're watching it,
6546700	6549700	now that thing is saved on your device, that movie or whatever you're watching.
6550700	6552700	I realize Netflix's onboard storage could be a challenge with this,
6553700	6557700	but I downloaded a movie to watch on a plane
6558700	6560700	and it's only like 600 megabytes or something because, you know,
6561700	6563700	it's only in like 720p, you know, or whatever.
6564700	6566700	It's not, you know, the highest definition picture
6567700	6569700	because those tablets aren't the highest definition things.
6570700	6574700	But anyway, I think maybe that's my point with all this is that,
6575700	6577700	okay, it's one thing to show the games up and on the go,
6578700	6581700	but you could bring in even more people to buy this device for their families
6582700	6584700	if you could show it with the TV as well.
6585700	6586700	And that's kind of been my point.
6586700	6588700	Like otherwise, sure, I agree with you.
6589700	6591700	You don't need Netflix on every single device.
6592700	6594700	The thing is the Switch does it differently
6595700	6597700	and even Nintendo is trying to sell that in their argument.
6598700	6599700	The Switch does gaming differently.
6600700	6602700	Now you can pick it up and take it with you on the go wherever you want.
6603700	6606700	So I just find it a missed opportunity, if you will,
6607700	6609700	that they're not doing this with Netflix, Hulu,
6610700	6612700	whatever movie technology would allow them to download on the go
6613700	6614700	and all this and do it.
6614700	6616700	Will they build in that technology by holiday?
6617700	6618700	They might. That could be something that could happen.
6619700	6620700	So I don't think this is a, you know,
6621700	6622700	certainly not something they can't just, you know,
6623700	6624700	backdoor into the system at some point or what have you.
6625700	6626700	Is this something that's going to wreck the system
6627700	6628700	if they never introduce it?
6629700	6631700	Clearly not. The system's doing pretty well as it is right now.
6632700	6635700	It definitely looks like it's going to have a more favorable outcome than Wii U
6636700	6639700	and if Nintendo gets what they want, it might even end up better than the Wii.
6639700	6645700	But I just think those types of apps can really kind of push it beyond just gamers.
6646700	6649700	You know, and I know, I know, I know you guys are probably rolling your eyes
6650700	6651700	because you're like, wait a minute, Rob.
6652700	6657700	You can't sit there and go, well, Microsoft talks about TVs and movies
6658700	6661700	and all this shit too much, but yet Nintendo doesn't talk about it enough.
6662700	6664700	Yeah, but the difference is the technology.
6665700	6666700	It's like James said in the email.
6666700	6671700	The Xbox and what it was doing was reductive to what your television can already do.
6672700	6674700	The Switch offers this new thing.
6675700	6676700	You can pick it up and take it on the go.
6677700	6678700	You can't do that with your TV.
6679700	6680700	The only thing I can think of where maybe you could do that
6681700	6683700	is if you had an Apple TV and an iPhone.
6684700	6687700	I suppose that may exist, but that is two separate pieces of hardware,
6688700	6689700	not one piece of hardware like the Switch is.
6690700	6693700	So that's all. I just, I see it as a missed opportunity.
6693700	6697700	But I think it's one Nintendo will probably inject into the system sooner rather than later.
6698700	6699700	I don't know. Any, any thoughts, Loki?
6700700	6702700	It's just added value. And even it would be nice just to take, like,
6703700	6707700	not necessarily even Netflix movies, but it'd be nice if it would just do any sort of media playback,
6708700	6710700	you know, throw some movies onto, because obviously, you know,
6711700	6713700	you're not gonna always have Wi-Fi with the Switch and stuff.
6714700	6716700	So say you're going on a plane or something like that
6717700	6718700	and you want to watch some movies on a flight instead of having, like,
6719700	6721700	to buy a tablet or have your phone or something to do that.
6721700	6726700	You throw some movies onto, you know, the SD card and away you go.
6727700	6728700	That'd be just nice.
6729700	6732700	I'm reading some comments in chat over at live.vog network.com.
6733700	6734700	Do I even know our own website?
6735700	6736700	William Ritterface in chat says,
6737700	6739700	Sky, you could conceivably do that with a laptop or a netbook.
6740700	6744700	Okay, but, like, seriously, I realize the demographic listening to this show
6745700	6746700	is not the every demographic out there,
6747700	6748700	but how many people have their laptops hooked up to their TV?
6749700	6750700	Not a lot.
6751700	6752700	I mean, soccer moms of America.
6753700	6755700	Do they all have their laptops hooked up to their TV and all this stuff?
6756700	6757700	I don't think they do.
6758700	6759700	Or how about kids?
6760700	6761700	Laptops are kind of bulky, you know what I mean?
6762700	6764700	Again, it's part of that magic of the Switch system.
6765700	6766700	It just fucking works.
6767700	6769700	If I didn't have a Wii U, let's just, like, switch it for the Switch,
6770700	6772700	because really that's what my son uses the Wii U for,
6773700	6775700	is he plays games on it and he'll watch YouTube on it.
6776700	6780700	So, like, you know, if we didn't have the Wii U
6781700	6784700	and he had the Switch instead, he could watch, you know, YouTube on that,
6785700	6787700	or, like, you know, play games on that as well, like a tablet.
6788700	6790700	I mean, he has a tablet now, too, but he didn't always have one.
6791700	6792700	And even still, even though he does have a tablet,
6793700	6795700	he still prefers to play some games on there.
6796700	6797700	Like, he'll want to play Minecraft on there.
6798700	6799700	He has Minecraft on the tablet, too.
6800700	6801700	But he plays Minecraft on the Wii U, because it has the controls,
6802700	6803700	and it's easier for him.
6804700	6805700	Akdeft in chat says,
6806700	6808700	Just wait for the holiday season. Netflix will be on the system by then.
6808700	6811700	I do think at the end of the day you're probably right with that.
6812700	6814700	Elliot B. in chat over at live.fognetwork.com says,
6815700	6817700	How many consoles have launched with media stuff and dropped it later?
6818700	6820700	3DS, Xbox One, Vita, question mark.
6821700	6824700	Has the media stuff been dropped totally from any of those?
6825700	6828700	I don't think Xbox One for sure. They have tons of media stuff on there.
6829700	6831700	Yeah, Xbox One is still pushing that, and so does PlayStation 4.
6832700	6834700	I mean, I still use a lot of Twitch on PlayStation 4,
6835700	6836700	and I do use Netflix on PlayStation 4.
6836700	6838700	I use 3DS because it's underpowered.
6839700	6842700	I'm pretty sure 3DS still has Netflix, though.
6843700	6844700	See, but here's the thing with the Vita.
6845700	6847700	Sony dumped the Vita, at least in America.
6848700	6849700	In Japan, different story.
6850700	6852700	And maybe this is the other element of all that,
6853700	6854700	and I honestly don't know the answer to this,
6855700	6859700	is how big is Netflix and all that stuff in Japan?
6860700	6862700	And maybe that's something I need to consider,
6863700	6865700	because Nintendo is going to make decisions,
6866700	6868700	not just based on what happens here in the U.S.,
6869700	6870700	but what happens in Japan.
6871700	6873700	Would there be a need for that, to have this type of Netflix type thing
6874700	6875700	where you pick up and move in Japan,
6876700	6880700	where transit is much more popular and all that stuff?
6881700	6882700	Kaijuto in chat says,
6883700	6885700	Vita has Netflix, just hasn't updated it.
6886700	6887700	Elliot B says,
6888700	6889700	Xbox One abandoned a lot of the TV stuff, right?
6890700	6894700	I think that stuff where you direct plug in your cable into the back
6894700	6897700	and your Xbox One was basically functioning as your cable box,
6898700	6900700	I don't think that functionality is gone, per se,
6901700	6902700	but I think it's just kind of flat-lined,
6903700	6904700	like it's not really getting updated anymore.
6905700	6908700	Like, the Wii U's TV thing, that got shut the fuck down.
6909700	6910700	That's gone.
6911700	6912700	That's something that got eliminated,
6913700	6914700	but I don't think the Xbox One got rid of any of that.
6915700	6917700	And certainly in the Netflix-style applications,
6918700	6919700	your voodoos, your crackles,
6920700	6922700	all the stuff that, when we say Netflix,
6922700	6924700	we mean all this other stuff too,
6925700	6927700	I think Xbox still has a lot of that stuff.
6928700	6933700	But again, I think a lot of it is in low maintenance territory.
6934700	6938700	Even Twitch, they just introduced communities on Twitch
6939700	6940700	and all that stuff, right?
6941700	6942700	I think the mobile versions of Twitch have that now,
6943700	6945700	but I'm not sure the PlayStation 4 ones do.
6946700	6947700	And I haven't used the Xbox Twitch in a little while,
6948700	6950700	if they have that whole element in them now.
6950700	6953700	But anyway.
6954700	6955700	Alright.
6956700	6957700	Thanks for the email.
6958700	6959700	It was still a good discussion.
6960700	6961700	I still appreciate the perspective and so forth,
6962700	6963700	and I realize there are a lot of you
6964700	6965700	that are very happy that they're focusing on the games.
6966700	6967700	Don't get me wrong, I am too.
6968700	6969700	I just see it as a missed opportunity
6970700	6973700	if they really want to get those Wii-like numbers
6974700	6977700	that are in the stratosphere of selling with a game console.
6978700	6979700	But we'll see.
6980700	6981700	I kind of think it's just going to end up there by holiday.
6982700	6985700	I think the Switch today versus the Switch in December
6986700	6987700	is going to look very, very, very different,
6988700	6989700	which is why we did the whole time capsule joke a few episodes ago,
6990700	6993700	to see what that's going to look like in December.
6994700	6995700	Alright, if you want to email us for our future episode,
6996700	6999700	participate at orangeloungeradio.com.
7000700	7002700	In the meantime, I'm thinking Loki might have a couple more stories for us.
7003700	7004700	Yeah, well, we can also probably do release dates.
7005700	7006700	Oh, yeah, that whole thing.
7007700	7008700	I guess I should probably try to find the Japanese release dates.
7008700	7010700	Okay, why don't you talk about what's happening in the US while I...
7011700	7014700	Sure. So, this week we actually do have quite a few things coming out.
7015700	7017700	So, starting off, Has-Been Heroes is coming out on PC,
7018700	7021700	the Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.
7022700	7024700	Also, we have Kingdom Hearts HD 1.5 Remix
7025700	7030700	and Kingdom Hearts HD 2.5 Remix coming out on PlayStation 4.
7031700	7034700	MLB The Show 17 on PlayStation 4.
7034700	7038700	A game called Old Time Hockey on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.
7039700	7042700	Parappa the Rapper Remastered on PlayStation 4.
7043700	7049700	Walking Dead Season 3 Episode 3 on pretty much all the different formats that that's on.
7050700	7053700	PC, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and mobile.
7054700	7059700	Attack on Titan Escape from Certain Death on the 3DS.
7060700	7062700	Blue Reflection on PlayStation 4 and Vita.
7062700	7065700	The Alliance Alive on 3DS.
7066700	7068700	This one's actually pretty awesome. I'm looking forward to playing this.
7069700	7074700	Thimbleweed Park. Remember that was the game that was the old LucasArts style point-and-click game.
7075700	7079700	It's actually done by... What's his name? I can't remember now.
7080700	7083700	The guy that did the original Maniac Mansion games and stuff like that.
7084700	7086700	Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. I know what you're talking about.
7087700	7089700	Ron Gilbert? Yeah, Ron Gilbert. Okay.
7090700	7094700	And, let's see, Musostars on PlayStation 4 and Vita.
7095700	7099700	Oh, and in case I didn't mention, Thimbleweed Park. That's Xbox One and PC, Mac, and Linux.
7100700	7107700	And finally, Overload on PC, Mac, Linux, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.
7108700	7111700	I want to say there was one other one on here. I didn't see it.
7112700	7115700	But I know I had it on the other list here.
7115700	7121700	I'm not positive because I don't see it on this list, but I want to say Strafe, I think, was coming out this week as well.
7122700	7128700	And that's kind of like a Quake, Duke Nukem style first-person shooter game.
7129700	7131700	So it's like that retro 90s stuff that's on PC.
7132700	7134700	That was a busy week. You know what else is this week?
7135700	7139700	There's a patch in Final Fantasy XIV, which, you know, for me, because I'm into that game, so that's a big deal.
7139700	7145700	But also, Final Fantasy XV, the Gladio DLC, is this week, as is the Chapter XIII redo.
7146700	7147700	So I guess I'll have to go back and play XV then.
7148700	7152700	Yeah, so it's a pretty big week. I mean, Square's dumping a lot on us with the Kingdom Hearts thing, too.
7153700	7158700	This is actually the week I've been waiting for for a couple years now.
7159700	7162700	Because, you know, I didn't buy the Kingdom Hearts 2.5 thing when it came out.
7163700	7166700	Because I said, they're going to put this on PlayStation 4 eventually, just like they did Final Fantasy X.
7166700	7167700	Of course.
7168700	7172700	So here we are. It's finally coming out, so I'm finally going to pick it up and might as well get the one.
7173700	7179700	Even though I did buy the Final Fantasy I, because that was a few years ago, I bought the 1.5 or whatever on the PlayStation 3.
7180700	7181700	It'll be nice to have that all on the PlayStation 4.
7182700	7189700	Because, you know, I'll have time to jump into another, what, probably 300 hours worth of RPGs in between the Mass Effect and Dromedan.
7190700	7191700	I'm trying to still beat, so yeah.
7192700	7195700	Anyway, let's travel to Japan and check out what's coming out over there.
7196700	7205700	In Japan this week, on March 28th, oh no, excuse me, I've got to push out to March 30th to get to Chaos, Child, Love, Chuchu on the PlayStation 4.
7206700	7209700	Musou Stars, also out there as well this week.
7210700	7218700	Also in Japan, Re Zero, Kada, Hajime-ru, Isekai, Sekkatsu, Death of Kiss in regular and limited edition.
7219700	7222700	And Darius Burst, Chronicle Saviors, also out in Japan this week.
7222700	7229700	Lastly, Blue Reflection, Maboroshi, Ni-mao, Shouju no Ken, also out in Japan this week.
7230700	7233700	And then on the Vita this week, that Musou Star is also being released on the Vita.
7234700	7239700	Zero, Kada, Hajime-ru, Isekai, Sekkatsu, Death of Kiss, also on the Vita.
7240700	7248700	As is Tokyo Xanadu, Blue Reflection, Maboroshi, Ni-mao, Shoujo no Ken, and Chaos, Child, Love, Chuchu.
7248700	7252700	So a lot of those same games on PlayStation 4 are also on the Vita over in Japan.
7253700	7258700	Lastly, checking the Switch, I don't think there's anything out on the Switch.
7259700	7262700	It looks like there's one game, there's Sango Kushi 13 with a power-up kit.
7263700	7265700	And I think this is another one of those, like, Romance of the Three Kingdoms types of games.
7266700	7268700	That's out on the Switch this week over in Japan.
7269700	7270700	So, there you go.
7272700	7274700	The UK, do you happen to have those handy?
7275700	7276700	Yes I do.
7276700	7278700	Oh my gosh, saves the day. What's up going on in the UK?
7279700	7282700	So in the UK we've got Strafe coming out on PC and Mac.
7283700	7287700	We've got Snake Pass on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.
7288700	7296700	And last but not least, Atari Flashback Classic Volume 1 and Classic Volume 2 on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
7297700	7298700	Those have been out here for a little bit.
7299700	7303700	It's like just getting a flashback console in game form, so whatever.
7303700	7306700	Yeah, so, that's it.
7307700	7310700	Alright, let's see, you got some more news for us to talk about?
7311700	7315700	Sure, let's talk about Castlevania Symphony Night, it's turned 20.
7316700	7317700	Oh my god.
7318700	7319700	It's been a long time.
7320700	7321700	Congratulations, everybody's old.
7322700	7323700	Exactly.
7324700	7330700	Let's see, so this is a little bit of drama, but there's that game, Yooka-Laylee, that's coming out.
7330700	7340700	And apparently a YouTuber by the name of JonTron, or Jon Jafari, who you may have recognized from social media recently because he said some choice things.
7341700	7346700	He has been dropped from the game because of his comments.
7347700	7356700	Playtronic basically made the comment, JonTron is a talented video presenter who we were initially two years ago happy to include as a voice contributor in our game.
7356700	7367700	However, in light of the recent personal viewpoints, or his personal viewpoints, we have made the decision to remove JonTron's inclusion from the game via a forthcoming content update.
7368700	7380700	We would like to make it absolutely clear that we do not endorse or support JonTron's personal viewpoints, and that as an external fan contributor, he does not represent Playtronic in any capacity.
7381700	7383700	So, drama be drama.
7384700	7385700	Whelp.
7386700	7389700	Freedom of speech does not mean freedom from consequence, that's all it is.
7390700	7391700	This is very true.
7392700	7393700	That's what it boils down to.
7394700	7396700	And I got nothing else to say about that.
7397700	7399700	What's up next?
7400700	7402700	How do we follow that?
7403700	7406700	Let's see, what should we talk about next?
7407700	7413700	I should have had the little bleep bleep, that's all folks queued up, because that seems the only thing that's appropriate for that moment.
7414700	7417700	Let's just follow that with some awkward silence.
7418700	7424700	Since we just talked about the anniversary of Symphony Night, I think it's only fair that we talk a little bit about Bloodstained.
7425700	7430700	So Bloodstained, I'm sure it's going to come as a shock, it's officially not coming out for the Wii U.
7431700	7432700	Oh my god!
7433700	7434700	So basically they said, you know...
7434700	7436700	I feel like we've reported this three times now.
7437700	7441700	I think we just assumed that it wasn't coming out for the Wii U, but now it's not officially coming out.
7442700	7449700	So, you know, thank you for supporting us, and the people that backed the Wii U version during the campaign.
7450700	7453700	The Wii U was the height of popularity, and because of...
7454700	7456700	Okay, maybe that's a little stretch, but whatever.
7457700	7458700	Those are some very nice things to say.
7459700	7461700	It was at the height of its popularity.
7461700	7462700	Okay, okay.
7463700	7464700	That's fair.
7465700	7469700	But the situation has drastically changed after the release of the Nintendo Switch.
7470700	7475700	This change has made it difficult to receive the necessary support from the hardware maker, which has led us to drop the Wii U development.
7476700	7478700	And shift the development to the Nintendo Switch.
7479700	7481700	Well that sucks if it's Nintendo's fault that they're not able to do that, but...
7482700	7487700	Okay, wait, I gotta hear more about this comment over on chat over at live.vognumber.com.
7488700	7491700	Stoppy in chat says Kickstarter scans and underdelivers once again.
7492700	7493700	I...
7494700	7495700	So is this...
7496700	7498700	Are you mad it's not coming to Wii U because you don't have a Switch yet?
7499700	7501700	I mean, I guess that's the one section of people I could see that are pissed.
7502700	7505700	Is that you own a Wii U but you don't own a Switch because you don't have the money for a Switch yet.
7506700	7507700	So you were kinda hoping to get this game on Wii U.
7507700	7516700	For the most... I imagine most people that are Nintendo fans have already moved on to the Switch or will be planning to by the time this game comes out.
7517700	7518700	Because it's still a next year game, right?
7519700	7520700	Still 2018.
7521700	7523700	So there's still plenty of time to get on board with the Switch or what have you.
7524700	7525700	So I'm assuming...
7527700	7529700	I'm assuming, yeah, most Nintendo people are gonna make that Switch.
7530700	7534700	However, I also know money ain't everywhere.
7534700	7537700	So some people really... you know, you can't just go out and buy a Switch today.
7538700	7539700	You have to save up and do that.
7540700	7544700	So it's kinda... it can probably be irritating if you bought this game already with Kickstarter or what have you.
7545700	7548700	And then now here it is that it's not even gonna be coming out on the Wii U and it's gonna come out on the Switch.
7551700	7553700	Oh, Stoppy says I was being sarcastic.
7554700	7555700	Oh, okay.
7556700	7559700	Well, dammit, I was actually looking for some counter perspective here.
7560700	7564700	Where every gamer has a voice, even your sassy ass voice.
7565700	7566700	Alright, so okay.
7567700	7571700	I guess that is the only counterpoint I can think of is that not everybody can just run out and buy a Switch.
7572700	7578700	But you do have a year to save up, so you just start putting $5 in the piggy bank every week.
7579700	7582700	So here's another thing, a little tease I guess.
7583700	7593700	The official Secret of Mana Twitter account has shown a clip of Seiken Densetsu 3 running on the Switch.
7594700	7599700	Of course, that game never left Japan and it is a Japanese Twitter account.
7600700	7602700	Looks like it might be running in Virtual Console.
7603700	7604700	Oh, did you... you didn't see the follow up for this.
7605700	7608700	They actually did release this... they did announce the Seiken Densetsu collection.
7609700	7610700	So that was... so you must have missed that.
7610700	7611700	I did miss that.
7612700	7613700	That's why I'm here.
7614700	7616700	They are going to release in Japan and I think it's in June.
7617700	7618700	Somebody in chat correct me if I'm wrong on that.
7619700	7620700	Because again, we're winging it tonight.
7621700	7624700	If you're just joining us, we didn't get to produce tonight's show due to some website errors that were happening.
7625700	7626700	So we're winging it a little bit.
7627700	7628700	So that's okay that Loki didn't pick this up.
7629700	7630700	But, oh yeah, when I saw this come out on Twitter I was all over this.
7631700	7632700	So it's official, the Seiken Densetsu collection is happening.
7633700	7634700	So it's going to be 1, 2, and 3.
7635700	7636700	So that's Secret of Mana and Seiken Densetsu 3.
7636700	7644700	And then what is Final Fantasy Legend on Gameboy here will all be released on one Switch cart in Japan.
7645700	7651700	Now because the Switch is region free... you could buy that here in the US as well.
7652700	7655700	However, all those games are still in Japanese.
7656700	7661700	And the pack is going to cost like... was it 4,500 yen?
7661700	7668700	So it's like, it's going to be at least $40 for 3 old games.
7669700	7671700	Now, you know, they're not just any 3 old games.
7672700	7673700	4,800 yen.
7674700	7677700	Yeah, 4,800 yen. So again, that's around like 45 bucks, 40 bucks.
7678700	7685700	So if they release that in the US, well I don't know, are they going to translate those games for the US?
7686700	7687700	We'll have to see what happens with that.
7687700	7693700	I think that could be huge though. I think there will be people that will pay $40 for an English translation in Seiken Densetsu 3.
7694700	7695700	It doesn't matter that that game is fucking old.
7696700	7699700	They would also translate Mother 3 and they would probably pay a lot of money for that too.
7700700	7706700	You know what? You know what? Depending on... Loki, this is a different time now.
7707700	7711700	I think that may not necessarily be off the table, if that makes sense.
7711700	7718700	Especially if they do translate this to English, and it does well, and I don't want to get too excited.
7719700	7724700	I'm tempering my enthusiasm because I don't expect that they're going to go back and make an English translation in Seiken Densetsu 3.
7725700	7728700	Well, do you want to hear my controversial opinion on this?
7729700	7733700	Why not? Why not? Let Rob get some hate mail for a change because not everybody is going to agree with me on this.
7734700	7738700	I think they should just snatch the translation that's already been done and put it out.
7738700	7746700	And some of you are going to be like, the fuck? That was a fan translation that people did. Yeah, well...
7747700	7748700	What are you going to do about it?
7749700	7750700	It was Square's game. What are they going to do about it?
7751700	7752700	You going to sue them?
7753700	7756700	It was Square's game that you all translated so you could play it free in an emulator for a year.
7757700	7758700	That would suck.
7759700	7761700	It's time for Square to get some of their money back, so to speak.
7762700	7764700	I know that opinion is not going to be popular, but...
7765700	7766700	But it is something they could do.
7766700	7770700	If that's what they have to do to get the game out in English...
7771700	7779700	It may be what they're doing. Remember, there was the virtual console games that had ROM dumps that were done by other people that somehow ended up in there, so...
7780700	7782700	It's possible they could do that.
7783700	7788700	JD in chat says, what's the licensing on the fan translation? The answer I'm giving is, does it matter?
7790700	7794700	Again, I know that's not an opinion everybody's going to like, but does it matter?
7797700	7800700	It was Square Enix's game. It was their words originally, right?
7801700	7813700	It technically still is their game, and they could argue that you're in violation of the copyright by reverse engineering the game, so they could take it down the fan translation, even though that is something that people do.
7814700	7829700	Now JD does have a more reasonable counterargument here, saying the game company's lawyers are not going to use it unless the translation was done under the most copyleft license, meaning it was a broad license or whatever, because it leaves them open to a lawsuit.
7830700	7831700	But, I mean...
7832700	7833700	It's just words.
7836700	7838700	It would be interesting. I'm just saying it would be interesting.
7839700	7840700	It would be an interesting lawsuit.
7840700	7847700	I don't think that's what Square is really going to do. Now, to put all this wank aside, Square would localize it themselves.
7848700	7851700	They could do it. It would be morally wrong, I think.
7852700	7854700	It's going to be a very strange group. That would be a hell of a court case.
7855700	7859700	They could do it because, I mean, it's a big company versus just some people that did it for fun.
7860700	7862700	Who may not even care anymore. I don't know. I don't remember who did it.
7862700	7867700	They don't have the money to defend themselves, so, I mean, really, a big company could do this.
7868700	7873700	Though, people might not think too highly of them after they did that, but I don't know.
7874700	7880700	Interesting. So, Elliott B. in chat says, it's just words, me pirating a million ebooks.
7881700	7890700	Here's the thing, though. Now, did the fan translation, didn't they translate words that were already written?
7893700	7896700	Technically, yes. Or did they rewrite it?
7897700	7898700	They may have done both.
7899700	7904700	Okay, if they rewrote it, then I get that argument a lot more than if they just translated what was already written.
7905700	7906700	Because then I think that's a little apples and oranges.
7907700	7913700	It's technically derivative, but I don't know. That would be kind of a weird gray area. I don't know how that would necessarily work.
7914700	7919700	Let's see, BlackWolf in our chat over at live.vognetware.com says, podcasts are just words.
7920700	7926700	Well, I can make money off this show? When's that gonna happen? It's only year 15.
7927700	7930700	Well, you see, we need to have a Kickstarter and then a Patreon.
7931700	7937700	Oh, I gotta tell people it costs $35,000 a year to do a podcast. That's right. I gotta tell them we have studio fees to pay for.
7938700	7940700	We have to pay people to produce it for us.
7940700	7942700	You said the hookers aren't gonna pay for themselves, okay?
7943700	7946700	That's right, that's right. I forgot about all that stuff. Anyway.
7947700	7951700	Buying pizza almost every week is expensive.
7952700	7958700	Anyway, all this wank aside and the shade y'all are throwing at me, it's not gonna happen.
7959700	7962700	If Square Enix does the English translation, they will do it themselves in-house.
7962700	7966700	And we'll see. I'm just curious if they are gonna do it or not.
7967700	7974700	Because that is gonna be resources that are way more than probably packaging these three games otherwise on the Switch.
7975700	7979700	But the whole wild card with this is the fact that it is region free.
7980700	7983700	You will be able to buy this and it will play on your North American Switch.
7984700	7986700	So surely Square Enix has to realize that.
7986700	7993700	But, you know, I doubt there are a ton of gamer people there in North America that are fluent in Japanese.
7994700	8000700	It's all math. So if it makes sense for them and they can make money from it, then they'll do it.
8001700	8005700	It's all about what investment they put in it and what the return is gonna be. That's what it comes down to.
8006700	8011700	So let's hope that they experiment with something and it does well, then it just leads to more other things.
8011700	8016700	Yeah. I mean, come on. How long would it take to translate a game like that?
8017700	8021700	You already have people doing it. They could kind of crib some of that shit. I'm just saying, you know.
8022700	8024700	Don't open that door again. I already got enough shades.
8025700	8031700	But I will say this. It is at this point old technology.
8031700	8041700	So do they have all the old Super Nintendo stuff available to go in and crack the ROMs the way they could, you know, 20 years ago?
8042700	8044700	That may be the thing, is that they don't have the tools to do it anymore.
8045700	8054700	That's like handing me a reel, an audio reel, and asking me to edit it together when it's like, dude, everything went digital years ago.
8055700	8060700	They don't have the tools. I was unaware that these companies have no access to the internet.
8061700	8065700	It was so befuddling to me that they couldn't figure this out.
8066700	8075700	I think if people that are not associated with this company can make tools to do that, I'm pretty sure these companies can make tools to do that if they don't already have tools.
8076700	8080700	Because guess what? They put out virtual console games, so they obviously have some shit to adjust those ROMs.
8081700	8084700	Come on. Don't quit before you've even started.
8085700	8088700	All right. Let's move on. Let's go to another story.
8088700	8094700	All right, so this is kind of fun. Speaking of, like, I was talking about that whole water festival thing.
8095700	8099700	Guess what came out with the water festival thing for Pokemon Go?
8100700	8104700	The fucking thing breaking my Pokemon Go Plus all the time now, whatever that version of it is?
8105700	8115700	Yes, it does that, but no, I'm talking about something that'd be more interesting to a certain somebody that listens to the show and also has a show on our network who happens to be obsessed by this.
8115700	8116700	Shinies.
8117700	8119700	That's right. Only Magikarp.
8120700	8122700	Only Magikarp, but they have a shiny Magikarp now.
8123700	8127700	And so, yeah, it's a yellow Magikarp, turns into a red Gyarados.
8128700	8132700	By the way, for the record, on the way to the movie, I asked said person about that.
8133700	8142700	Because I actually, we were right by. I had to get work done on my car this weekend, so he was good enough to come pick me up at the car place so we could go to the movie while I was getting the car worked on.
8142700	8148700	And the car is right by one of the big Ingress farms out in Folsom, right?
8149700	8156700	So I was like, oh, well, while we're here, do you want to just drive through? Because I know this is a big farm for Ingress, so it's got to be a ton of PokeStops. You want to drive through and get PokeBalls?
8157700	8160700	He's like, I don't play Pokemon Go. I was like, did you not hear about the shinies?
8161700	8167700	So, by the way, if y'all want to know what happened to PokeStop Podcast, that's what happened to PokeStop Podcast.
8170700	8171700	Just saying.
8173700	8174700	Alright.
8175700	8179700	Anyways, so this is another thing that's going on with the Nintendo Switch.
8180700	8188700	So there's this company, Game Truck, who does these mobile trucks that you can rent and they bring them to locations and they have games inside of them.
8189700	8198700	Well, Nintendo's partnered with them now and they're going to have some that are going to be, 100 of the game trucks are going to have playable versions of 1-2 Switch and Legends all the breath of the wild on Switch systems.
8198700	8201700	And, of course, they're going to be adding Mario Kart 8 later on when it comes out in April.
8202700	8207700	So you can reserve your game truck now and they're going to have that promotion going on through June 20th.
8210700	8211700	That sounds incredibly boring.
8212700	8217700	I mean, I get it, the game truck thing and stuff, but who would want to watch you play Zelda?
8218700	8219700	It's a one player game.
8220700	8228700	Like, I get mobile, I get some land stuff going on there and Mario Kart would be a good choice for that, but it's like, I'm playing Zelda. Wow, that's cool.
8229700	8234700	Isn't that what Twitch lets me do? Like, whoa, I'm playing Zelda, other people can watch me. That's Twitch.
8235700	8242700	I mean, shit, even the PlayStation 4 SharePlay, if I don't want to be public about it, because Twitch is very public, right?
8242700	8256700	But I've done that where I play on SharePlay on PlayStation 4, so it's private, so that I'm not actually streaming online, I'm just streaming for somebody who, you know, wanted to see the game that can ask specific questions or whatever.
8257700	8268700	That's a very, uh, I mean, it's like, it's just like a, I don't know, camper show, like a, not a mobile home, but like a camper that they have games inside.
8269700	8276700	It's a very small room, they have like this stupid video on their website where all the kids are, like, cheering, the truck's coming down the street, I'm like, no, no they're not. No, they're not doing that.
8278700	8283700	Um, but like, they're all playing, let's see what games are they playing, they're playing Halo, they're playing fucking Halo.
8283700	8286700	They should have had those pictures of Donald Trump driving the truck.
8286700	8289700	They're playing, they're playing, they have eight player land Halo going on.
8289700	8291700	Okay, that's kind of cool though.
8291700	8299700	Yeah, and see, a mature rated game, by the way, nobody gives a shit about the fucking rated, you know, M rated games.
8300700	8310700	We had a conversation about this with some of the parents, because they were talking about like, you know, oh my god, that game has sexuality, that game doesn't have sex in it, because my son plays Call of Duty and like that stuff, you know.
8310700	8312700	No, just blowing people's faces off the guns, that's all.
8312700	8317700	Yeah, I'm like, yeah, you find people, you know, blowing heads off, but you're not finding sex, yeah, that's right.
8317700	8324700	Don't show them that scene from Mass Effect Andromeda, because I'm telling you, titty, Loki, there's full on titty in that game.
8326700	8327700	Uh, yeah.
8327700	8328700	Yeah.
8330700	8333700	Alright, should we open up Skype line? Want to open that up?
8333700	8334700	Let's do it.
8334700	8338700	Let's do it. Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype, if you want to give us a call.
8338700	8342700	Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype, if you'd like to give us a call.
8342700	8347700	We'll talk about whatever, or maybe we missed something that you want to talk about tonight, we can certainly do that.
8347700	8349700	If you want to do it the old fashioned way, you can do it that way too.
8349700	8353700	Actually, no you can't, because we got a call coming in right now, so let's get to it.
8353700	8355700	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?
8355700	8357700	Hey, hey, it's...
8357700	8361700	Hey, you're cutting up a little bit there, but I think it's Rama, right Rama?
8361700	8367700	Yeah, I just had to finish doing a bunch of rebuilding on my machine, so it's a little temperamental right now.
8367700	8369700	Yeah, I'm getting that echo thing too, but what's on your mind?
8369700	8378700	Well, two things. Earlier in tonight's broadcast, you talked about people being gay and lesbian, and my thing is this, I don't care what you are.
8378700	8381700	Are we still going to the bar later? Yes or no?
8381700	8383700	Perfect, I'm fine with that.
8383700	8391700	Exactly. Do whatever you want to do to make sure you're... as long as you're happy, fuck it. I don't care.
8391700	8395700	As long as we can still chill, hang out, have a good time, that's all that matters.
8395700	8398700	Thank you very much. That and equal tax laws, that's all we have.
8399700	8405700	And secondly, the whole JonTron thing, I'm just going to put it like this.
8405700	8419700	When you are that type of person where you do camming, web shows, podcasting, you should not use that platform for your own political thoughts and views.
8419700	8429700	It's one thing to tell your listeners to fight for what you believe in, as opposed to saying, well, my views is dah, dah, dah, dah. That's the way it should be.
8429700	8438700	And if you know you have controversial views after throwing it out there the first time, maybe you should just kind of like keep that shit to yourself.
8441700	8444700	Well, it's complicated.
8444700	8445700	It's complicated.
8445700	8446700	Oh, I know. I know.
8446700	8455700	Because we sometimes say political things on this show. But as I mentioned a minute ago, I haven't made a dime off this show in 15 years.
8456700	8472700	Yeah, but Rob, the difference is what you've said on here isn't really political. It's like, it is, but at the same time, you say it in an aspect of, you know, what is wrong in this world, what we have to do, as opposed to going against the grain. You see what I'm saying?
8472700	8478700	No, I do. I do. And I would never, I would never encourage hateful rhetoric. Ever.
8479700	8480700	Exactly.
8481700	8487700	Anyway, I'm hearing myself through your speakers, so I have to wrap up a little bit. But any other last thoughts for us, Rama?
8488700	8493700	No last thoughts. I will be up for a while putting my machine back together.
8493700	8494700	Alright, have fun.
8494700	8495700	Have fun.
8495700	8496700	You too.
8496700	8497700	We'll talk to you on Tuesday. Bye.
8497700	8498700	Bye.
8498700	8514700	Anime Jam Session, of course, Tuesday nights here at the Voice Geeks Network, vog.network.com. Sorry, I hate cutting Rama short, but could you guys hear it too? I mean, I know you can hear it in the studio, you can hear myself coming back through, right? I don't know if that carried over over the air, but that was a lot going on there. Let's get to another call. Hi, you're on Orange Lawn's Radio, who's this?
8516700	8518700	Hi, can you hear me?
8518700	8520700	Hi, hello, you're on Orange Lawn's Radio, who's this?
8520700	8522700	Hi, this is Elliot B.
8522700	8524700	Hi, Elliot B. Wow, aren't you on the other side of the pond?
8524700	8527700	Not any longer, I actually moved to New York last year.
8527700	8534700	Oh, well, welcome, I suppose, even though I'm a year late, but what's on your mind? What's on your mind tonight?
8534700	8551700	Well, I was lucky enough to pick up a Nintendo Switch on Tuesday. I went by the Nintendo store at lunchtime, because I work in Midtown Manhattan, and they said, oh, we don't have any in stock at the moment, but if you subscribe to, you know, if you follow us on Twitter.
8552700	8563700	So I turned on Twitter notifications on my phone, and they happened to, and then 15 minutes later, they tweeted, oh, we've got some, we're going to have some in stock at three o'clock in the afternoon.
8565700	8574700	And that was at 2.30, I think. So I rushed out my office and got in line. There was about 20 people ahead of me already by that point.
8576700	8580700	And yeah, I got one, so I've been playing tons and tons of Zelda.
8580700	8593700	Congratulations. That's kind of a miracle that you happen to be in the right place and see that tweet and everything. That's everything lining up perfectly. That says a lot to the 20 people were still there ahead of you.
8593700	8598700	My question is, how many of those 20 people were scalpers? Dirty, filthy scalpers?
8599700	8611700	That's a good question. I don't know. I was only speaking to the people. There were a couple of people in front of me that was like a 15-year-old kid with his dad. I don't know how they both managed to get there, you know, with 10 minutes.
8612700	8621700	But yeah, it seemed like genuine fans in the queue. It didn't seem like, in the line, sorry, I'm still learning American English.
8621700	8628700	That's okay. We can figure some of the things out. We know a lift. We know a lift is an elevator. You know, same thing. We figured it out.
8629700	8631700	It's also not a taxi here.
8632700	8633700	It's not a what?
8633700	8634700	A lift.
8634700	8648700	Oh, I see what you did. Sorry, that was a little too complex for even me. I'm a big stupid American. I don't understand. Anyway, so you've been playing Zelda on the Switch and it sounds like you're having a good time?
8648700	8661700	Yes. I just beat the first Divine Beast today. And yeah, I'm sort of like, I beat that bit and then I'm used to kind of pass those. They're like, okay, now go on to the desert or something.
8662700	8670700	And now they're like, yeah, you've got this huge entire map that you can now explore. It's kind of overwhelming. But no, I'm loving the game.
8671700	8675700	I was thinking, do you remember when the first trailers came out for Twilight Princess?
8676700	8677700	Yes.
8677700	8682700	The Zelda that I was imagining from that trailer, this feels like that game finally, like a decade later.
8683700	8694700	A decade late. But no, I mean, just the openness of it. I mean, even Twilight Princess. I mean, I still enjoy Twilight Princess for what it is. But you were still in these narrow areas where your exploration was very limited.
8695700	8706700	Or at least in Heinz. I mean, I don't know, it didn't feel so limiting at the time. It just kind of felt like the way games were. But now in retrospect, hell yeah, those games feel so limiting compared to how open Breath of the Wild is, you know?
8707700	8709700	Oh, yeah, yeah.
8710700	8717700	Let me ask you this. Are you playing anything besides Zelda on the Switch? Because we know everybody with the Switch is probably playing Zelda, but have you checked anything else out?
8718700	8726700	Not really. I downloaded the... there's a demo. The only demo on the store is for that game. It's a co-op game where you have to cut each other out.
8727700	8728700	Oh, the Snipperclips?
8729700	8733700	Snipperclips, yeah. Which I quite like the demo to. It's kind of hilarious. Have you played it?
8733700	8744700	I actually have a little bit. A friend of ours had it and brought it over. We were playing for... I was watching him and Alan play. I didn't get to play a lot, but I did play a little bit of it.
8745700	8752700	It's definitely because it's a puzzle game, you have to kind of communicate. But I was getting really frustrated at one of the puzzles because I'm like, this is too hard.
8753700	8762700	Yeah, my girlfriend and I were playing the demo and I was getting so frustrated with her that I thought if I actually dropped the $20 on the real game, it might lead to some sort of breakup.
8763700	8765700	That's not good.
8766700	8781700	Not to throw shade on her gaming abilities or anything, but yes. It requires a lot of cooperation and a lot of trying to explain. Yeah, if you cut me in kind of exactly that exact shape, yeah, like more of a curve sort of thing.
8782700	8789700	Well, don't get Mario Kart or Mario Party either because those games can also end relationships, so be careful. Be careful.
8789700	8795700	Well, that probably is the next game I'm going to get, Mario Kart. I'm looking forward to that one. I need a good multiplayer game for this system.
8796700	8809700	I'm looking forward definitely to the multiplayer capabilities when you're in one room. I don't know if you do the conventions and all that stuff or just meetups with other gamers, but I think something like Mario Party is really going to kick ass in that sort of setting.
8810700	8815700	I just love the idea of carrying it somewhere and breaking out the Joy-Cons and passing them around.
8815700	8827700	Yeah, for sure, for sure. Alright, well congratulations on getting a Switch and getting down there to the store with, oh gosh, in 20 minutes. That's amazing that you were able to get over there so fast and end up getting a Switch.
8828700	8833700	Well, hopefully more will become available, as Loki was saying earlier, but there's still a scarcity right now.
8834700	8836700	It's amazing. They're out of stock in about half an hour.
8837700	8842700	Oh my gosh, wow, wow. Well, that's better than NES Classic Mini.
8842700	8844700	Whatever happened to that?
8845700	8847700	Oh, I'm sure they have one monkey working on that now.
8848700	8855700	I don't know about that. I think they're trying to get us to forget about that system even though it was like the biggest thing at Christmas, but whatever, whatever.
8856700	8859700	Alright, well, Elliot, thanks for the call and good to hear from you.
8860700	8861700	Yeah, cool.
8862700	8863700	Keep enjoying the Switch. Alright, take care.
8864700	8865700	Bye.
8865700	8876700	Bye-bye. Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype if you want to give us a call. Loki, I'll check in with you once again here before we close up the Skype line. See if you have any other stories you want to get out here.
8877700	8880700	Uh, no. I think we covered pretty much everything.
8881700	8882700	What?
8882700	8900700	Well, there's one article that's about Nintendo not necessarily going towards microtransactions in their mobile platforms, so they're saying, you know, I guess the Super Mario Run did not meet their expectations in terms of actually making money, even though it was downloaded 78 million times.
8901700	8903700	And they just released it on Android this week too, which is kind of a big deal, right?
8903700	8914700	They said that, um, they said that about 4 of the 78 million people, or, you know, 4 million of those, did buy the game, which is about 5%.
8915700	8923700	So they made $40 million. Well, no, because the store, okay, because Apple and so forth get a cut of, what, about 30%, right? So they made...
8924700	8926700	Like 20-some-odd million dollars on it?
8927700	8934700	Yeah, okay. Let's say we'll say half the money, because marketing, etc. I mean, they probably made more than 20 million, but still, we'll say that.
8935700	8938700	For an Android game. I think that's pretty damn good.
8939700	8943700	Interesting. Well, maybe they learned some things in the whole experience, though.
8944700	8950700	Well, in the figure, I mean, the Android version just came out, so, I mean, that was only a small portion of the marketplace out there.
8951700	8956700	They did wait an awful long time to put that on Android. I don't know if they had some sort of deal with Apple where they couldn't.
8957700	8962700	Well, remember, they were, I thought they were worried about the whole, like, copy protection garbage or something.
8963700	8965700	I don't know, that's a weird thing to worry about, but whatever.
8966700	8969700	Yeah, they were worried about piracy on the Android. That's what they were worried about.
8970700	8976700	But, I mean, but that didn't stop them with, what, Fire Emblem? Although, Fire Emblem, like, consistently talks to the, well, so does Super Mario Run.
8976700	8978700	Does it say Fire Emblem has to continuously talk to the only server?
8979700	8984700	Yeah, it does, it does, because my son's in the middle of a level, and I had to reset the router, and he's like, Dad, it stopped working!
8985700	8986700	Oh, no.
8987700	8988700	Which is stupid, yes, it is absolutely stupid.
8989700	8990700	You kicked your son off the game, you're so cruel.
8991700	8992700	I know. It's so terrible.
8993700	8995700	One more shout-out for calls, and then we'll close up the Skype line.
8996700	8999700	Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype, if you want to give us a call.
8999700	9011700	Rama and Chad Agreen, they should have gone to Android first, bigger install base. I don't necessarily agree they needed to go to either one first, just don't make it, like, how many months has it been since it came out on my phone?
9012700	9028700	Well, they're saying that even though, even the whole thing, the point was, though, even though they didn't make as much as they had thought they would on Super Mario Run, and even though Fire Emblem Heroes is doing pretty good, even with the microtransactions, they said they still want to stick with that kind of, you know, one price point.
9029700	9034700	Format that they don't sell the microtransactions. I think it's because they're kind of used to that.
9035700	9039700	Which is good. Any company that gets out of microtransactions is a good thing, I think.
9040700	9045700	Alright. Well, I guess nobody else is calling us, Loki. I think that's going to wrap it up for the Skype line.
9046700	9052700	But if you were just being shy, you can always email us as well. Participate at OrangeLoungeTrader.com if you'd like to send us an email.
9053700	9064700	Otherwise, I think that's probably going to do it for tonight's OLR. Not bad for having, you know, no production really going into tonight's episode, but luckily we had a game we ran about for a little while at the top of the show there.
9065700	9075700	Hopefully Dark Soccer is feeling better, and we'll be back next week. We're also going to be joined, as mentioned, next week by SacIGDA in preparation for the Sac Indie Arcade event.
9075700	9085700	I do want to remind people there will be no show that Sunday, so April 9th, there will not be an OLR because April 8th, we will have been broadcasting all day long.
9086700	9092700	There's so much going on on that weekend. I have not just one now, but two people coming in from out of town.
9093700	9100700	So I have plans. I know I have a rough life, right? But I have plans Friday night, I have plans all day Saturday, and now I have plans Sunday night when we would usually be doing OLR.
9100700	9104700	It's just like when it rains, it pours. But I'm looking forward to that weekend. It'll be a lot of fun.
9105700	9113700	It will be. It will. So looking forward to broadcasting from the Sac Indie Arcade event. We'll talk to Gabe about that next week, and hopefully Brie will be here too, whoever else might be coming from the event.
9114700	9127700	And then we'll be doing that on Saturday. I'm hoping maybe we can wrap all the post-production of that up real fast so that maybe Sunday night instead of OLR, if you miss the broadcast on Saturday.
9127700	9135700	I'm not going to promise this yet until I know I can turn it around fast, but maybe we can re-run it on into Sunday night when OLR would usually be on.
9136700	9143700	That's what I'm going to try to aim for. Even though it is quote-unquote all day, it really only ends up being like five hours maybe.
9143700	9154700	I think that's going to do it. Let's go around and get final thoughts. Oh, I do have to give a quick shout out as always.
9155700	9161700	If you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Launch Radio, please tell a friend or two about the show. Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice.
9162700	9171700	But not if the voices ain't here. So a nice five-star review on a place like iTunes or Google or wherever it is you found this show, that all goes an awful long way as well.
9171700	9176700	So we really appreciate all of that. Otherwise, do we have any final thoughts from Loki tonight?
9177700	9194700	I ordered some filament in preparation for my printer to be shipped at some point. But I ordered orange filament and purple filament. So maybe I'll make something related to one of the shows.
9195700	9196700	Why not?
9197700	9198700	That's why I ordered the printer though.
9198700	9202700	Yeah, start cranking out some stuff I can give away at DragonCon this year. You're a factory now.
