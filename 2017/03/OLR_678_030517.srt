1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,640
It's here, it's here, the latest release of worldly travel with technology along the

2
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:18,640
way.

3
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:21,800
That's right, Horizon Zero Dawn is finally out to scratch all your mechanical overload

4
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:22,800
survival dr...

5
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:23,800
No.

6
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:24,800
What?

7
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:25,800
The Switch.

8
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:26,800
What, like a light switch?

9
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:27,800
No, the Nintendo Switch.

10
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:33,320
What's a Nintendo Switch?

11
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:36,160
This week, the Nintendo Switch was released.

12
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:43,840
Stay tuned for more!

13
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:46,880
Jason just totally pulled in, I don't even know her there in the intro.

14
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:49,360
Hi everybody, my friends out there on the internet.

15
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:53,920
Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice, it is Orange Lounge

16
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:59,440
Radio, live tonight, March the 5th of 2017, episode number 678 of our show.

17
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:04,680
My name is Rob Roberts, joining me in studio, as always, say hello to DarkSakura, or Jamie

18
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:05,680
Summers.

19
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:06,680
Words.

20
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:07,680
Hello.

21
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:08,680
Greetings.

22
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:11,120
Sorry to hear you're still sick, but you sound a lot better, you look a lot better.

23
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:14,520
I feel better, well I've also got a lot of makeup on.

24
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:18,600
I feel a lot better than I did.

25
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:21,440
But you have this weird thing with your taste buds, like you were telling me earlier that

26
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:23,000
chocolate tastes like soap.

27
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,960
Yeah, actually everything tastes vaguely soap-like.

28
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:34,200
I don't know if it's the Zithromax, but it started happening before I was on azithromycin.

29
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:40,000
I've been on two different antibiotics, but I feel a lot better than I have in a while.

30
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,960
Well good, feeling better is good, that's where we want you to be.

31
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:49,920
I feel like Frank, even smiling makes my face ache.

32
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,360
It's funny because when you were talking about that you don't taste things the same, my first

33
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:58,920
thought y'all was, I want her to lick a Nintendo Switch cartridge live on air.

34
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,600
And I was going to bypass that whole thing because I'm like, okay, that joke is like

35
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:07,360
played out, like everybody who wanted clicks watched me lick a thing.

36
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:12,920
And to think, that girl that licked the PSP was a fame whore at that time.

37
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:15,680
But now y'all licking Nintendo Switch cartridges like the candy.

38
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,440
This would be science.

39
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:21,280
And then you'd have my DNA on your games.

40
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:28,280
Yes, and now I'm like Dark Sakura, now we have a reason why for science, exactly, that

41
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:31,920
maybe she does need to lick a Nintendo Switch cartridge because I want to know if under

42
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:36,360
the right chemical thing, maybe it tastes like soap as well.

43
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,440
Well if you want, it's your stuff.

44
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:42,240
Alright, I'm going to think about it while we introduce Tech Master Loki.

45
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:45,080
The other thing is what it would taste like with those little miracle berries.

46
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:47,920
Alright, Tech Master Loki, how are you?

47
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,400
I'm fine.

48
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,400
Yeah, good?

49
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,400
Yeah.

50
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:55,360
You sound a little exhausted when you say that, I'm fine, like it's been a real long

51
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,360
week or something.

52
00:02:56,360 --> 00:03:00,560
It's exhausting eating those 11 breadsticks.

53
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,440
The Dark Sakura ate one, she's like...

54
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:07,200
I was wondering, you know, for science, you know, since she's tried chocolate and it tastes

55
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,440
like soap, maybe soap tastes like chocolate.

56
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:13,240
I'm not going to lick soap.

57
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,240
That's unhealthy.

58
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,320
Dark Sakura.

59
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:19,360
I love the coffee, it's like I'm getting a hint of what the flavor would have tasted

60
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,360
like.

61
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,360
And then soap.

62
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:25,600
Like freaking ivory bar soap, seriously.

63
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:30,160
Now I'm sure Dark Sakura, you might be wondering like, why is Dark Sakura eating soap?

64
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,160
To know this.

65
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:37,640
But I'm sure as a child, she had soap in her mouth a lot and got to know the taste very

66
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:38,640
well.

67
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:43,480
Well, a good way to know how something tastes is to smell it.

68
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:47,760
Because your olfactory scents, which I have none right now, and your sense of taste are

69
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:48,760
tied.

70
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:55,480
And when one of those is depressed or whatever, then the other is going to be affected.

71
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:58,200
And that's the exact thing with the Nintendo Switch cartridge for me.

72
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:03,640
Like I don't need to lick it because you can smell that new case smell that isn't exactly

73
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:04,640
pleasant.

74
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:05,640
It's not a new car smell.

75
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:06,640
A new car smells nice.

76
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:11,280
A new cartridge, when you open that, you know, Zelda case for the first time, it's kind of...

77
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,880
I don't even know if I'd go that far.

78
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:17,200
Like it just smells like, like a chemical that I don't want to eat.

79
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,200
That's what it smells like.

80
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,200
A chemical.

81
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:24,760
Well, it's just, well, and everything vaguely smells either like soap or blood.

82
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,240
There's no in between.

83
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:30,040
This is the stupidest sick I've ever had, next to walking pneumonia.

84
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:33,320
Or is Dark Sakura just cleaning her victims before she kills them?

85
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:37,200
So if they put that stuff on the cartridge because they don't want to eat, do they put

86
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,200
it on the controllers?

87
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,800
Because I don't think they put it on the controllers.

88
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,440
I don't think they did put it on the controllers.

89
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,240
Have your kids put it in their mouth yet?

90
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:45,560
I don't, I'm sure I don't have, you know, kids.

91
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:49,000
I'm sure a kid is, what are you talking about?

92
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,960
You should do have kids.

93
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:52,960
Ask Nellie.

94
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:53,960
Hold on a minute.

95
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,840
Did Loki just come out here and be like, I don't have kids.

96
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:59,480
Like why, why, why are you a pathological liar on tonight's OLR, Loki?

97
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,840
Yes, you do have kids.

98
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:07,640
It's just my, my path to presidency, right?

99
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,000
I don't have kids, Rob.

100
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
You have kids.

101
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,160
I don't think you're the one that has the kids, these are my kids.

102
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,520
They're yours now.

103
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:17,520
Bringing them over, bye.

104
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,720
Touched them less.

105
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,520
You're the one that's been wiretapping my house.

106
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,520
All right.

107
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,520
Anyway.

108
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:23,520
Anyway.

109
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:27,880
No, I don't have a Switch, so obviously I can't eat anything that's in the Switch box.

110
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:28,880
Right.

111
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,160
So you have, you don't have, you have kids, but you don't have a Switch.

112
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,160
That's, that's the difference.

113
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,440
Yeah, I have kids and no Switch.

114
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:38,960
And I'm not planning on buying a Switch and I also didn't buy Zelda because I don't have

115
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,080
$60 right now to spend on Zelda.

116
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:45,080
So I will just wait a couple of weeks and play it then.

117
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,360
Money, serious business.

118
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:50,400
Well, I could, I could buy it now, but then there may be a chance that I won't be able

119
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,920
to afford food later in the week.

120
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:52,920
That would be unfortunate.

121
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:53,920
Yeah.

122
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:57,200
I would just rather not do that because I don't need to.

123
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:59,480
I'm already playing Skyrim, so I don't need that.

124
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,480
All right.

125
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,960
We'll talk a little more about the Switch here in a moment because it's that thing everybody's

126
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:03,960
talking about.

127
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:06,880
But I want to get to our chat room, of course, and acknowledge you guys live in our chat

128
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:10,720
room because we do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock

129
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:13,560
Eastern at vognetwork.com.

130
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:18,600
That's V-O-G network.com right after the Bobby Black Wolf show, who talked also a lot tonight

131
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,960
about the Nintendo Switch.

132
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:23,880
Now, obviously there's a, there was a lot that happened in games this week.

133
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,020
It could be easy to sit here.

134
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:27,320
We could probably talk for three hours about the Nintendo Switch.

135
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,880
However, there's a ton of other stuff that happened in gaming.

136
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:32,160
Game developers conference happened this week.

137
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,160
Hello.

138
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,160
But it was interesting.

139
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:38,240
We didn't really get a lot of news out of game developers conference, did we?

140
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:44,120
We got like weird little like tidbits and insight, like w w like that eight bit Zelda

141
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:48,260
picture that came up where everybody was like, Oh my God, it's Zelda maker.

142
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:53,320
But no, like a Nintendo would not announce a Zelda maker at a GDC type event.

143
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:58,460
B what it ended up really being was that, you know, Breath of the Wild was basically

144
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:04,020
created in that eight bit environment to build some of the, you know, ideas that they

145
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:08,580
had going into that game were kind of executed in the eight bit format before they, they

146
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:15,300
did the big fancy world that they have now making a long story prototyping the, the concepts.

147
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:16,300
Yeah.

148
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:18,660
There's a lot of talk about like what goes into game development.

149
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:19,660
That's really it.

150
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:23,780
I mean, there's other little things here and there, like the first 10 minutes of the, um,

151
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:25,300
gone home successor, was it Tacoma?

152
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:28,140
So what it's called like, I think like the first 10 minutes of that were shown, it's

153
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:31,660
just like some little tidbits here and there, but not a very news filled game developers

154
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:36,900
conference, nothing like on the scale of like PlayStation move or anything, which again,

155
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:41,420
game developers conferences, not E3, it is, it is for those types of, but I would totally

156
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:47,460
go for more, you know, a better PlayStation move if you will.

157
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:51,500
Well, isn't that kind of what they're trying to do with the VR and those controllers and

158
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:52,500
everything?

159
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:53,500
Right.

160
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,040
But I mean, like the PlayStation is not doing that.

161
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,740
They're like, yeah, we have these move controllers.

162
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:57,740
Those will work.

163
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:03,100
Uh, some comments in chat over at live.vognetwork.com, uh, because of course, again, we tape live

164
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:04,100
on Sunday nights.

165
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:07,400
I want to get to some of our chatters, uh, SSU100Matt talking about the taste test for

166
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:11,580
Dark Sakura says, the real question we need to know, what does pinkberry taste like?

167
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:14,180
I think someone should go get her some to test this.

168
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:16,020
I agree with this, but I will tell you this.

169
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:20,020
I have orange sherbet at home and it tastes kind of off too.

170
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:21,420
Does it taste like soap?

171
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:26,060
Not quite like soap, but like orange medicine.

172
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:27,100
Oh.

173
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:28,460
Like Dayquil or something.

174
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:29,460
Kinda.

175
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:30,460
Yeah.

176
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:34,340
It's like the edge between, this tastes really good to, this tastes like fucking Dayquil.

177
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:35,340
Mm hmm.

178
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:36,340
So, or like Theraflu.

179
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:41,540
Uh, Darktosea in chat says, I just thought that thing was neat, interesting way to prototype

180
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:42,540
for Breath of the Wild.

181
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:45,620
Uh, yeah, I thought it was a neat, uh, discussion too.

182
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:50,060
Um, and that's, you know, again, what GDC is really for is about like here, here's how

183
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:51,620
the sausage is made type of thing.

184
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:55,500
Here's the thought process that went into what we made and yeah, Black Wolf kind of

185
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:59,020
echoing there in chat, GDC shouldn't be for news anyway.

186
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:04,820
Um, yeah, I can agree with that to a point, but you also in the past, they have dropped

187
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:08,460
a few bombshells here and there, but that's usually Sony that's done that, right?

188
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:12,660
They did the move one year and they did, they announced something else one year.

189
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:15,460
Was it the VR or was it something else they announced GDC?

190
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:17,540
I want to say it was another one of those things that kind of came a win.

191
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:22,180
I don't think it was the VR, but anyway, like, you know, sometimes with those tech development,

192
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:25,580
you might get a little, little few drops here and there because while you have all these

193
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:30,300
game developers there, they want these developers to think about, Ooh, how could I develop for

194
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:31,300
that?

195
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:32,300
Right.

196
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:34,580
That's why you announced the PlayStation move early like that is, Ooh, how can I develop

197
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:35,580
for this?

198
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:39,520
But you know, you're not going to get like, Oh my God, Half Life 3, like that's not going

199
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:41,340
to fucking happen at a game developers conference.

200
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:46,400
So, you know, it, it is for talks and, um, a lot of networking that goes on at the, those

201
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,400
events for sure.

202
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:52,000
Uh, wheeling and dealing of those sorts, but, um, otherwise, yeah, it's, it's, it is for

203
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
the developers.

204
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,880
Uh, thank you, Bobby Black Wolf.

205
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:55,880
That's it.

206
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:57,280
PlayStation home was announced to GDC.

207
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,280
That's right.

208
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,280
That was the other thing I was thinking of.

209
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,280
Thank you.

210
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,280
Uh, let's see.

211
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:07,240
Also in chat, um, over at live.vognetwork.com actdeft is wondering, did dark soccer confuse

212
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:09,480
dove soap with dove chocolate?

213
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,480
That's a, that's a great question.

214
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:14,920
Very, you know, your products at a supermarket, very well done.

215
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:16,880
Let's see.

216
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:21,880
Uh, Stoppy talking about the, uh, eight bit Zelda thing says, uh, I call that BS.

217
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:25,440
It's like saying checkers was a prototype for tactical RPGs.

218
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,440
I don't know.

219
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,440
I kind of thought it was neat.

220
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:31,080
There's a lot of, there, there is a lot of stuff from Zelda one that I see in the new

221
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:33,960
Zelda, but we'll, we'll get to that in a little bit.

222
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:36,360
Being that I was doing prototyping all this week.

223
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,360
Yeah.

224
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:40,880
Um, no, that is how you do prototyping because you don't want to spend a ton of time and

225
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:46,040
money on an elaborate prototype when you're just prototyping certain concepts like the

226
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:51,160
fire spreading thing and trying to solve, you know, puzzles in multiple ways.

227
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:52,560
You don't need anything elaborate.

228
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,360
You just want to try it so that you can get feedback right away.

229
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,360
I'm kind of surprised.

230
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:59,840
I mean, again, I don't know all the insides of your, your project you're doing and I know

231
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:04,260
I'm not supposed to, but I'm kind of surprised you guys didn't go to GDC for a day or anything

232
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:05,260
like that.

233
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:06,260
I was kind of surprised.

234
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:09,360
So, yeah, we don't think we need to not in the budget.

235
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:13,800
Well, not in the budget and not really needed at this point yet.

236
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:14,800
Fair enough.

237
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:15,800
Fair enough.

238
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:16,800
All right.

239
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,120
Um, so let's talk about here for our kickoff topic tonight.

240
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,320
Let's talk about the Nintendo switch.

241
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,920
What do y'all think over in chat over at live.fognetwork.com?

242
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:25,120
Those of you that picked one up, do you, do you think it was worth the money?

243
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,560
Uh, do you, are you happy with your purchase?

244
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:29,560
Where, where's your head out with the Nintendo switch?

245
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:32,600
Um, I'll talk about my thoughts in a little bit.

246
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:37,160
Um, I want to get to dark soccer though, because you spent, even though you and Dan did not

247
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:43,140
buy a switch, but you did buy Zelda Breath of the Wild on Wii U and you played a buddy's

248
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:46,240
switch for a good 30 minutes or something like that.

249
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,240
Yeah.

250
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,640
Um, he brought his switch to work.

251
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:51,120
So while he was working, I was on lunch.

252
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,120
I played for a little bit.

253
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:54,800
So you didn't walk away that impressed with it, huh?

254
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:55,800
Not really.

255
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:58,520
It's nothing that I would want to go out and spend money on right away or would have waited

256
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:01,560
for the reservation or anything like that.

257
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:11,400
So for, for me, the, there was two, I don't know, the controller when using just the controller

258
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:16,400
felt too lightweight, too almost flimsy to me.

259
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:20,560
I mean, the buttons were nice, they were responsive, but it didn't feel substantial.

260
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:25,340
It had the same comfort of the Saturn analog controller, which as I'm sure everyone knows

261
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:31,860
is my favorite home controller, but, um, it didn't have the same sturdiness and heft

262
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:32,860
to it.

263
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:35,860
Are we talking about the controllers attached to the screen or are we talking about that

264
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:38,060
little puppy dog shell, the controller shell?

265
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:39,060
Okay.

266
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:40,060
Okay.

267
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:41,060
Just the control.

268
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:42,060
Cause we had the little screen out independently.

269
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:43,060
Right.

270
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:46,580
And graphically I didn't see too much of a difference except it was a little bit harder

271
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:51,340
to see cause that smaller screen, it's still actually was cause even on the Wii U there's

272
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:56,060
a, uh, uh, areas where you'll get draw distance issues and the same thing was happening on

273
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:57,460
that little screen.

274
00:12:57,460 --> 00:13:02,820
And then, um, the other thing is that it was kind of hard to see, like the motion was a

275
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:05,580
little bit harder to detect on that smaller screen.

276
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:10,980
And then, um, with it connected with the, the joy con connected on either side and at

277
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:13,560
that point then felt too bulky.

278
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:16,860
So it just like there wasn't a happy medium with it.

279
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:19,060
Um, I haven't tried it on a TV yet.

280
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:24,840
I would, I'm curious, but, um, I would actually be more curious to see it on my TV so that

281
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,980
I can actually switch channels.

282
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:32,900
Um, this is something that Dan and I did with, um, Symphony of the Night where we had the

283
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:38,820
PlayStation one and the Saturn one and we're switching between, uh, channels to see what,

284
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:41,020
you know, do a graphical comparison.

285
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:46,560
I'd really like to get to the same place in both games and then switch channels to see

286
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:52,640
what it looks like to compare because I think doing it on two different TVs wouldn't be

287
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:56,900
a really good test because different TVs display different ways, but I'd like to see it like

288
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:59,180
on my TV both ways.

289
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:04,840
So even though your perception of Zelda in particular was a little more negative, these

290
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:08,980
first impressions of the Switch, you're still kind of like, I'm still open to get one when

291
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:11,120
the games start coming out a little later on, right?

292
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,120
That's, that's kind of the sense I got from you.

293
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:16,400
There is no reason for me to have one right now, because I mean, there's no Animal Crossing

294
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:24,640
Um, the other game that I wanted, Puyo Puyo Tetris, I already own, I have it on PS4.

295
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:29,200
And so there's, there's legitimately no reason for me to have one.

296
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:33,880
But when we start talking about the Splatoon twos and the Mario Odyssey's and whatever

297
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:34,880
other surprises.

298
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:35,880
I haven't played the first Splatoon.

299
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:36,880
Oh, you're missing out.

300
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:37,880
So I'm not excited.

301
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:38,880
It's fun.

302
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:39,880
You're missing out.

303
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:40,880
I'm sure it is, but I'm not excited.

304
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:45,840
I mean, I have no basis of comparison and Mario, I mean, I'll be honest, I'm not as

305
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:52,160
excited over Mario games these days, you know, I want there to be something that is going

306
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:55,880
to, uh, I think be more exciting.

307
00:14:55,880 --> 00:15:00,320
I want something unique, something different, you know, I mean, the only thing out right

308
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:05,440
now that I would want to play is Binding of Isaac two and even then, you know, and that's

309
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,440
not actually out yet.

310
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,440
Yeah.

311
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,440
It's not on the story yet.

312
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:12,440
At least not in the U S they had the, um, the advanced orders.

313
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:15,240
I think it's like soon it's within the next couple of weeks.

314
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:18,760
I think they're really trying to use the Indies to kind of pace out some of the releases

315
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:21,360
a little bit like blaster master is next week.

316
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,360
Yeah.

317
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:26,040
So, and that's, I'm really excited about that is happier about that, but I'm still not,

318
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:28,160
I'm still not sold.

319
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:32,280
And I mean, I went into two different game stops today, um, because I was looking for

320
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:37,700
Wii U pro controller, which they didn't have, I got it at target, although I did get a Jessica

321
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:42,080
Jones pop figure cause it's the only place I've seen it, but you know, and I was just

322
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:45,600
talking to the staff, you know, just, you know, shooting the shit.

323
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:49,960
And they're like, yeah, they all went out really quickly, but you know, we haven't had,

324
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:53,520
you know, other than that, there hasn't been too many people in asking about them.

325
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:59,160
So it was kind of like that initial rush, but you haven't had a lot of like either just

326
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:02,680
people kind of know they're gone or yeah, they just like, yeah, we're going to get some

327
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:08,140
more, but right now the only ones that we have in stock are, um, our, uh, orders.

328
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:12,420
And they said that, um, even then no one's come to pick some of those up.

329
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:18,040
Um, going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com, uh, come on, Noel, Gus and chat says it's

330
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:19,040
been underwhelming.

331
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:23,540
I love breath of the wild, but other than that, it feels like a generic Android tablet.

332
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:26,960
If I could play Overwatch on it, I probably wouldn't complain, but yeah, it sucks.

333
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:29,020
There aren't other games to play.

334
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:32,760
And then, uh, let's see, act deft in chat over at live.vognetwork.com said I would give

335
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:35,700
my opinion on the switch, but we all know what happened.

336
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:38,660
Amazon apparently fucked a lot of people over.

337
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:45,940
Um, and I feel kind of bad because I got, I ordered from Amazon and I got it.

338
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:50,700
Uh, I was a little worried though for a minute, which is the whole reason why I had the two

339
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:52,780
systems pre-ordered in the very beginning.

340
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:57,060
I also had one from Best Buy, but I was able to find a home for the Best Buy one and I

341
00:16:57,060 --> 00:17:00,220
don't, I don't scalp, I charged exactly what I paid for it.

342
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:04,760
So it worked out all in the end or what have you, but yeah, Amazon really screwed a lot

343
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:05,760
of people over.

344
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:10,320
Uh, and apparently they were like charging cards when they didn't really have the inventory

345
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:14,460
or they were, they weren't charging, they were putting the hold on them and Amazon had

346
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:15,680
no reason to do that.

347
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:20,040
So I was, because they didn't have the stock for it, they didn't make good on the delivery.

348
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:24,840
And I think Amazon has a big part of its, its case that it tries to do with Amazon Prime

349
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:26,780
is that you get the release day delivery.

350
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:31,040
So a lot of the crap they've been pulling from what I'm hearing, again, my experience

351
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:36,600
ended up being fine, but I know several people, not just Act Deaf, but I know quite a few

352
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:39,440
other people that were having problems with Amazon.

353
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:43,880
So I think that was kind of bullshit on Amazon's part and I'm kind of glad they're getting

354
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:47,080
dragged through the media for it and I sort of think it's unacceptable they didn't have

355
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:48,080
an answer yet.

356
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:54,280
Um, so I, I hope that Amazon comes out on Monday to talk a little more about how they're

357
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:58,480
going to prevent that kind of crap in the future because that was, uh, that was, um,

358
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:02,920
really just, it makes a lot of people question if they want to order stuff from Amazon in

359
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:03,920
the future.

360
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:08,800
Uh, when it comes to like release day delivery and all that stuff, I mean, ordering a Blu-ray

361
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:12,160
that you don't need right away or something is one thing, but you know, when you want

362
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:15,720
something on the day it releases because that's where all the hype is at or whatever, like

363
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:16,960
that's what you expect.

364
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,800
So, um, yeah.

365
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:22,120
The worst part to me is the fact that Amazon put a hold on the cards.

366
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:25,040
Uh, that's, that's the part that I can't reconcile in my mind.

367
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:30,160
Like it would be one crime for them to, well, not, not actual crime, but it'd be customer

368
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,160
service crime.

369
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:34,760
It'd be one thing for them to not deliver on the promise they made, but it's a whole,

370
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:39,320
like it's even worse that they put the holds on the cards and still didn't deliver on it.

371
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:43,640
That is really fucked up and, uh, Amazon needs to answer for that.

372
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:48,480
I, I, I told one of my friends to file a complaint with a better business bureau, but my friend

373
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:51,840
was like, oh, that never does anything and that I'm like, well, it doesn't do anything

374
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:54,840
because everybody's, everybody, well, everybody's

375
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:58,040
he sits there and says, I'm, it's not going to do anything.

376
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:00,920
If everybody who sat there and says, it's not going to do anything, did something, then

377
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:05,640
it would force Amazon to at least answer the question about what's going on.

378
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:11,300
And I, they may have put, I think I did, they, they put some, you know, very general type

379
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:16,680
of thing out there, but it is really messed up that Amazon had, they were saying, come

380
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:18,080
to our bookstores.

381
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:23,040
We've got the Amazon's or the Nintendo switch here at our Amazon bookstores come to this

382
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:27,580
and, and was advertising all these other ways, but yet they could not fulfill the obligations

383
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:32,840
that they had in the other side to, to me that says, is Amazon too big of a company?

384
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:34,380
Does it need to be broken up?

385
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:38,080
Cause it doesn't know what the other ends of the company are doing, but I will go there,

386
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:46,320
but I'm just, no, you know what they should do instead sell more games through other platforms.

387
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:47,320
I see what you did there.

388
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:48,320
Yeah.

389
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,320
We'll get to that a little later.

390
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:50,320
Okay.

391
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:51,320
Um, okay.

392
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:55,040
Let me talk about me and the Nintendo switch though, because, um, I'm, I'm walking away

393
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:56,960
from it feeling more positive.

394
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:01,100
I think a lot of the complaints that have been put out here on this show, especially

395
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:06,320
in regards to, um, the amount of software that's out right now and all that stuff.

396
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:12,200
Uh, the fact that the OS is, is pretty much half baked, that there's a lot to come soon.

397
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:14,160
That all still kind of holds true.

398
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:18,040
But I will say this, I walked away from it feeling different than dark Sakura.

399
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:21,360
I thought the controllers in the shell, I really liked the way that felt.

400
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:26,720
Um, and especially when I was playing a game like fast racing remix, when the HD vibrations

401
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:29,960
came into play, which you can even feel in the shell, like I thought that was a really

402
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:31,720
good feel for the game.

403
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:34,980
Um, so I actually liked the controller.

404
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:38,760
It is a little bulky when you have the controllers on the side and you're playing it as a tablet.

405
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:41,620
That was not my favorite way to play.

406
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:43,200
And I don't think I'll be doing that a lot.

407
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,800
Like I, I, you know, tried it a couple of times this weekend.

408
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:51,000
Like I would lay in bed and play Zelda or something like that, which it is kind of a

409
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,960
small screen for a game like Zelda.

410
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55,140
There's a lot going on.

411
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:58,360
I think that small screen probably works, works a lot better with something like probably

412
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:02,740
the one, two switch game or like fast racing Neo or something where there's not as much

413
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:07,400
like writing or small details in the distance things you're looking for, uh, that probably

414
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,400
work a little better.

415
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:12,860
Um, on a television, they do that, that, that, uh, tablet.

416
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:20,340
But to the tablet's credit, I was like, wow, this is a very bright, vibrant, detailed screen.

417
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:24,140
And I, I thought it was a neat little piece of technology.

418
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:27,380
And I think the whole thing feels really sleek to me.

419
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:32,220
Like it feels like something Apple would have put out, honestly, like the, the switch feels

420
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:33,980
really nice in that regard.

421
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:39,340
And one thing I do like about the OS is that everything really snaps.

422
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:44,020
Everything is very fast and I've gotten to come to accept with Nintendo systems that

423
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:45,920
they're very slow and clunky.

424
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:50,540
Like the Wii, it's like now loading the everybody votes channel, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,

425
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:51,540
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

426
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:53,900
Like in that whole thing or the eShop, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, like it's

427
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:58,100
like one loading screen turns into another loading screen turns into like, it's really,

428
00:21:58,100 --> 00:21:59,220
really slow.

429
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:02,920
But on the switch, everything is pretty fast.

430
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:08,380
Like going in, going into your picture gallery to edit the picture and share the picture

431
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:10,300
is like navigating a website.

432
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:15,860
It's really fast and not like a clunky mess.

433
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:20,420
Like it kind of is on the 3DS trying to share things to Miiverse.

434
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:24,940
I am a little surprised though that Nintendo did not take the opportunity to, when you

435
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:28,920
have this friends list and you have these things that you're sharing, I'm really surprised

436
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:33,820
that it didn't create a newsfeed type of thing like you have on PlayStation 4.

437
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:35,300
Maybe that's something that will come in the future.

438
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:41,260
I don't know, but the OS on the Switch, as we all know, is very bare bones right now.

439
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:43,600
There is really not a lot there.

440
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:47,860
One of the other big things that came out this week, the whole fact that friend codes

441
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:52,380
are back and they're on the Nintendo Switch, which we thought Nintendo was fucking done

442
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:55,620
with, but it looked like they weren't.

443
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:59,680
However, this is a big however, it does function very differently.

444
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:05,640
It's not quite as bad as it was on the Wii because, picture this, instead of a gamer

445
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:08,540
tag right now, you have a barcode number.

446
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:09,960
That's basically how it works.

447
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:13,080
So if somebody knows your barcode number, they can still send you a friend request.

448
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:16,120
You don't have to do that whole thing where it's like, I'm going to add you, then you're

449
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:19,080
going to add me, and then if we both added each other, we'll be friends.

450
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:20,760
You don't have to wait for that whole process.

451
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:23,720
You still send a friend request like you do on the other consoles.

452
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:28,160
The other thing is that strangely, even though on the Switch you can't search Twitter and

453
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:32,120
Facebook for your friends, even though the system connects to Twitter and Facebook for

454
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:38,160
the sharing of the pictures, you can see who you've added on Miitomo and who you've added

455
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:41,280
on Super Mario Run.

456
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:46,360
I still have not played the Fire Emblem game, but I imagine that's there too.

457
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:49,520
Those games will connect to your Twitter and your Facebook.

458
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:53,520
So since I added most of my Facebook Nintendo peeps through those games, they're all showing

459
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:54,520
up on my list.

460
00:23:54,520 --> 00:24:01,240
My only grievance is that the list that's showing up is like everybody's first name

461
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:05,320
because it's not showing their tags or their Nintendo Network names or whatever.

462
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:09,680
It's showing whatever they use to sign into their console at home, which most people use

463
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:11,000
their first name.

464
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:17,280
Now I use Rob Roberts just because that's just become synonymous with my identity online

465
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:18,280
and everything.

466
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:20,560
So I know when I'm sending friend requests to people, they see Rob Roberts, and it's

467
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:22,760
pretty easy to know who I am.

468
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:24,300
Bobby was talking about this on his show.

469
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:25,420
His name is Black Wolf.

470
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:27,180
So I know who that was.

471
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:32,260
But then I'll get a friend request from Chris and I'm like, who the hell is Chris?

472
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:34,760
And I'm like, this me doesn't look very familiar to me.

473
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:39,940
I know like five different Chris's and maybe this is somebody on Twitter where like, if

474
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:43,620
it was their Twitter handle, I'd know who it is instantly or if it's their Twitter picture.

475
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:44,620
Yeah.

476
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:45,620
New Switch, who dis?

477
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:49,680
That's exactly the game that I've been playing all week.

478
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:50,940
But here's the other thing.

479
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:54,660
And the reason why I haven't been giving out my friend code or really seeking out to expand

480
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:59,580
my friends list right now, why, why do I need friends on the Switch?

481
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:05,700
There's literally nothing it does, except I can see when they're online and what they're

482
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:06,700
playing.

483
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:08,000
Can't send them messages.

484
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,740
I don't have any games that I can, I have Zelda and I have fast remix and I probably

485
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:15,100
will end up buying Shovel Knight before the week is up and I'll probably get Blaster Master

486
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:16,100
next week.

487
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:18,820
That's a pretty, that's a nice little set of games there for the first two weeks of

488
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:24,980
a console, but none of them connect to online and use my friends list yet.

489
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:29,700
Fast Rebracing is supposed to do that in its first update, but otherwise what's the point

490
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:30,700
of a friends list right now?

491
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:31,700
There really isn't one.

492
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:35,980
It's just kind of like you're building it out because you hope that later on when Splatoon

493
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:40,980
2 comes out, which is really going to need that online thing to be done, then you have

494
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:44,780
your friends list built up so that you have lots of people to splatter with point paint

495
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:46,980
a little later on.

496
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:55,100
So even though there's some weird shit with the friend codes and these other things that

497
00:25:55,100 --> 00:26:00,900
are definitely like half baked and under finished in the OS, what it does do, it does very well

498
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:02,460
and it does it fast.

499
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:07,780
And it does have me excited for like, wow, when this gets to the holiday and Nintendo

500
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:12,700
really sees out its roadmap and you know there's a roadmap because you go to one thing and

501
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:16,460
it'll be like, this feature will be enabled when we go online in June.

502
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:20,460
This feature will be enabled when such and such launches in October.

503
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:24,020
This feature will be enabled when we figure out how to do networking.

504
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:29,540
It's like you see everything's got a month with it, but I am excited to see what it's

505
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:34,100
going to look like towards the end of the year because I think at the end of the year,

506
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:38,020
this is going to function a lot more like we kind of thought it was going to in the

507
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:42,060
beginning and maybe some of these shortcomings will be fixed.

508
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:46,860
Which brings me to the other thing I want to do here at the top of the show, which was

509
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:48,300
something we talked about last week.

510
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:52,740
So last week I said, what we need to do is we need to, since we know the Switch is going

511
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:57,160
to change a lot before December, we need to have the world's smallest time capsule or

512
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:58,740
shortest time capsule.

513
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:03,660
So we're going to actually build one here in studio that we will open at the end of

514
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:06,420
the year for either the Christmas show or the New Year's show.

515
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:08,780
So here's the deal.

516
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:11,540
Stoppy in chat says, Sky, did you remember to bring the sock?

517
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:12,660
No, good news.

518
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:13,940
We don't have to do the sock tonight.

519
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:16,660
Well, maybe I'll put a sock in there, but here's the thing.

520
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:20,300
Dark Sakura found a target in the discount aisle or something.

521
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:23,460
She's got this little like Darth Vader looking thing.

522
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:25,500
Is this like a kid's bank or something?

523
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:29,700
Yeah, it's like a little coin bank, but it has the shape I wanted.

524
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:31,020
It has the shape.

525
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:32,020
It's perfect.

526
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:35,980
It actually looks like something that you could like shove up an elephant's butt.

527
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:37,640
That's what it looks like to me.

528
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:39,160
It's an elephant suppository.

529
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,160
Exactly.

530
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:42,560
But that's, I guess that's what a time capsule should be, right?

531
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:47,120
So we're going to, we're going to put some things now in the time capsule.

532
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,360
What are we going to put in here?

533
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:55,680
We want to put, what are our grievances with Nintendo Switch that we hope they fix by holiday?

534
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:58,920
What do we hope the Switch looks like by holiday?

535
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:01,840
That's what we're going to put here inside the time capsule.

536
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:06,080
So I'm going to get some pieces of paper here and I brought two pieces of paper.

537
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:08,800
Sorry, I guess we'll have to share a little bit, but Loki, here you go.

538
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:12,640
I'll give you a piece of paper, save one for me because I want to start writing.

539
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,320
I did not prepare well for this.

540
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:19,160
Oh, if you guys in chat over at live.vognetwork.com have some ideas.

541
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:20,160
No, I think that's-

542
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,160
I don't get to contribute.

543
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:22,160
No, you get to contribute.

544
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,160
We just have to share a little bit.

545
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:24,160
Geez.

546
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,160
But you have to tell-

547
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:26,160
I don't want to share.

548
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:27,160
On my own.

549
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:28,160
Tough.

550
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:29,160
I'm going to wash, I'm going to wash your mouth out with soap.

551
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:31,320
I'm going to wash your mouth out with chocolate.

552
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:32,760
All right.

553
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:36,040
Anyway, I'm going to get a pen over here.

554
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:37,800
We need to start talking about the grievances.

555
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:40,540
Loki, I know you have some grievances.

556
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:42,960
What are you going to put in the time capsule, Loki?

557
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,960
I don't know.

558
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:48,040
I haven't actually played the system yet.

559
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:52,520
I mean, I have lots of grievances, mainly stop releasing unfinished consoles, goddammit.

560
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:53,520
But that's not-

561
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:54,520
Okay.

562
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:55,520
Hold on.

563
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:56,520
Hold on.

564
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:57,520
That's not a grievance.

565
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:58,520
Yeah, I know that they can fix.

566
00:28:58,520 --> 00:28:59,520
Yeah.

567
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:03,140
Well, it is one they could fix, but that's not going to be fixed for several years.

568
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:05,860
That's not something they can do by the end of the year.

569
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:06,860
That's the problem.

570
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:09,820
Is it supposed to be like what I think the grievances are going to be by then?

571
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:10,820
So like if I say-

572
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:11,820
No.

573
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:12,820
Here, let me give you an example.

574
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:15,740
Here's the first thing I'm going to put in the time capsule.

575
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:19,000
Did they bundle?

576
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Did they bundle?

577
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
I'm actually writing.

578
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
That's what I'm talking about.

579
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:27,840
Did they bundle one, two, switch in yet?

580
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:29,100
That's the first thing I'm going to put in.

581
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:30,620
Did they bundle one, two, switch in yet?

582
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:32,100
I'm going to put a statement.

583
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:33,100
Aw, fucking hell.

584
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:36,700
They delayed the new Super Mario Brothers game again.

585
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:39,580
There, you could put that in there.

586
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:40,580
You write that.

587
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:44,420
I bet they delayed Mario Brothers there.

588
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:46,060
And we're going to sign these too.

589
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:48,220
You have to be responsible for the crap you put in there.

590
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:49,220
All right.

591
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:50,220
So there's my first.

592
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:51,820
Did they bundle one, two, switch in yet?

593
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:52,820
Signed Rob.

594
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:54,380
So Loki's putting in.

595
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:56,500
Did they delay the Mario game?

596
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:58,180
All right.

597
00:29:58,180 --> 00:30:00,620
Dark Soccer, I see you writing over there.

598
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:01,620
What are you writing?

599
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:03,140
Virtual Console.

600
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:04,420
Oh, yeah.

601
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:06,580
Where's my damn Virtual Console?

602
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:08,020
I had another one too.

603
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:09,420
And what's that you're going to write?

604
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:16,820
The DS Store or like some of the old games like they had on the DS Store.

605
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:19,540
So like, did they add DS to Virtual Console?

606
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:22,500
Well, they did do that on the Wii U though.

607
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:25,420
I don't know how they would do that with the switch because there's just the one screen.

608
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:26,620
I don't know if they would do that.

609
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:28,020
I guess they might.

610
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:33,220
You could do something where maybe you tilt the tablet vertically and it could be two

611
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:34,220
screens.

612
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:35,220
Just scrap that.

613
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:36,220
Okay.

614
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:37,220
I would go with augmented reality.

615
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:38,220
Oh.

616
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:41,860
It doesn't have a camera on it, but if it had, it doesn't have a camera on it, does

617
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:42,860
it?

618
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:43,860
No, it doesn't have a camera on it.

619
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:44,860
What about virtual reality?

620
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:46,980
Some people suspect they could go that direction with it.

621
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:49,420
No, I want augmented reality.

622
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:54,980
Like for example, if it had like a camera attachment, you could then, you know, like

623
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:57,820
things like Ingress or, you know.

624
00:30:57,820 --> 00:30:58,820
Pokemon Go.

625
00:30:58,820 --> 00:30:59,820
Or Pokemon Go.

626
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:00,820
Exactly.

627
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:01,820
Okay.

628
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:02,820
Okay.

629
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:03,820
Now I see where you're going with this.

630
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:08,500
Because you can, we do know Nintendo is going, you might think like, well, that's not going

631
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:12,020
to work, Jamie, because the tablet has nothing in it besides wifi.

632
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:17,020
However, we know the tablet is going to connect to your phone through an app because that's

633
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:18,540
how the voice chat's going to work.

634
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:25,020
So theoretically, what's stopping that tablet from being like a Pokemon Go Plus or something?

635
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:28,300
Doesn't it work in the same way where it's using the information from your phone to get

636
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:29,300
the data it needs?

637
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:33,980
Or even so, like the way that, you know, I have a first gen Apple watch and it doesn't

638
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:38,820
have the built in GPS, but it'll still, I can go walk around the block, come back and

639
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:44,040
sync my data and it would pull my GPS based off my phone, my phone location.

640
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:48,140
So the same thing in theory could work on the Wii U, I mean not the Wii U, but the Switch.

641
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:49,140
Yeah, I know.

642
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:52,100
I see the people in chat saying there's, you need a GPS attachment for that.

643
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:53,240
There's no GPS.

644
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:55,440
If it does Bluetooth though, it'll connect to the phone.

645
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:59,000
It could, I think it is a stretch, but why not?

646
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Yeah.

647
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
Just a tad.

648
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:05,120
It's, it's like, Hey, I've got this phone that could totally run, you know, Pokemon

649
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:09,840
Go with the GPS and the data, but instead I'm going to tether to this large cumbersome

650
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:10,840
thing.

651
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:15,360
I'm not saying specifically Pokemon Go, I'm saying you can have a more advanced augmented

652
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,360
reality.

653
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:21,880
But the money was in Pokemon Go, so why wouldn't there be something else AR that Nintendo is

654
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:22,880
going to try?

655
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:27,400
I'm going to be this year myself, but, but that would be something I think would be definitely

656
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:28,880
something that would get more people to buy it.

657
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:29,880
All right.

658
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:30,880
Well write it down.

659
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:31,880
What the fuck?

660
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:32,880
All right.

661
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:33,880
Good.

662
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:34,880
All right.

663
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:35,880
Uh, let's see.

664
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:36,880
Um, go into it.

665
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:37,880
I'm looking into chat over at live.fognetwork.com.

666
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,280
JD has a good one.

667
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:40,800
Better me import.

668
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:45,380
It's dumb that it can't pull from the Nintendo account or me Tomo.

669
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:46,380
That's a good point.

670
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:47,380
We're going to write that.

671
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:49,880
We're going to write that one down and we'll credit that to JP.

672
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:51,680
Oh, do you write that one down for JD?

673
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:52,680
Okay.

674
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:53,680
I was trying that one for JD.

675
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:55,180
I was thinking of it too.

676
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:56,180
So I totally agree with that.

677
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:57,180
So you stole it.

678
00:32:57,180 --> 00:32:58,180
All right.

679
00:32:58,180 --> 00:32:59,180
No, no, no, no.

680
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:01,680
I credited it to him, but I was thinking I would like me verse.

681
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:02,680
Fair enough.

682
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:03,680
Fair enough.

683
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:04,680
Uh, Oh, okay.

684
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:05,680
Here's a good one from dungeon buster.

685
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:06,680
I'm going to write this one down.

686
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:07,680
Okay.

687
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:12,120
Dungeon buster said, has Nintendo lowered the bullshit pricing for their pro controller

688
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:13,120
yet?

689
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:14,120
And I liked, yes.

690
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:15,120
What do you mean?

691
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:17,480
The Wii U pro controller went down.

692
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:20,680
I'd imagine that the switch pro controller, not in a year, not in the first year.

693
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:21,680
It's not going to happen.

694
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:23,720
Not in the first year, but I'll write it down.

695
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:24,720
I'll just write down.

696
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,480
Did any of the accessories go down in price yet?

697
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:30,480
Cause they're all that fucking was it the doc or whatever.

698
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:36,040
I saw the tear down video that is not $90 with a tech as just fucking plastic and like

699
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:38,960
some pastors and that's it.

700
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:39,960
Some bullshit.

701
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:42,040
That's what that is.

702
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:43,040
Okay.

703
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:44,040
Dungeon buster.

704
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:48,080
You know, this whole writing thing doesn't make for very good radio.

705
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:49,520
Well, I can read mine then.

706
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:50,520
All right.

707
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:51,520
All right.

708
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:53,360
And this is only obvious.

709
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:59,280
I bet the system's hacked already.

710
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:00,960
Two months to Linux.

711
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:03,200
I don't even give it that.

712
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,200
Yeah.

713
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:08,160
It's, they're already trying to find exploits and it's only going to piss people off more

714
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:13,520
that they block out, you know, features that most of their consumers like, you know, like

715
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:16,320
being able to back up their data and stuff like that.

716
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,720
And you know, being able to transfer saves.

717
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:21,000
But of course we're so afraid that they're going to get hacked.

718
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,000
Oh my goodness.

719
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
We're so afraid.

720
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
It's going to get hacked anyway.

721
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,400
So you know what?

722
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:27,400
There's nothing you can do.

723
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:29,000
There's nothing you can do.

724
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,000
It's just going to happen.

725
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:40,280
Well, there's a whole thing about the, the, the save States and all that.

726
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:44,760
I know, I know you're mentioning, but um, they go online or they'll, they'll work around

727
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:45,760
it.

728
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:46,760
Hacker's going to hack, right?

729
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:47,760
Right.

730
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:48,760
They're already trying to exploit it through the web browser.

731
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:51,560
That doesn't exist, but does exist.

732
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:56,360
People have actually exploited that to create a web browser for it already.

733
00:34:56,360 --> 00:35:01,520
Um, let's see what else to, uh, what else do I want to put in the time capsule?

734
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:04,760
Um, I think the virtual console one was good.

735
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:07,560
That was the one I was thinking of as well, but you already got that in there.

736
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:14,980
Um, Oh, maybe with the virtual console though, maybe the whole, like, can we really play

737
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:17,580
the games online virtual console?

738
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:19,980
Like they said on the website, that's what I want to know.

739
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:21,700
I'm going to write that down.

740
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:22,700
Okay.

741
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:28,780
I also would, would like to see better, like some kind of streaming incorporation too,

742
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:32,260
you know, like, uh, kind of like how the PS four does.

743
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:36,780
I mean, if you could take screenshots and post them, you know, what's to say they can't

744
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:40,380
get like recordings eventually.

745
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:42,620
And they're supposed to be doing something like that.

746
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:48,940
So that's not a bad idea either streaming or, um, or like, you know how like you can

747
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:52,860
record video in the Sims.

748
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:57,060
So yeah, or like even Mario Kart, you could sort of do it even though Mario Kart kind

749
00:35:57,060 --> 00:35:58,060
of cheated.

750
00:35:58,060 --> 00:36:03,500
Mario Kart would, uh, do the replay in a higher rendering, uh, than the actual game was.

751
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:06,300
But I mean, it's still, it worked very well.

752
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:07,300
All right.

753
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:09,300
Uh, let's wrap up.

754
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:10,300
Let's wrap up.

755
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:12,980
Get the last ones written down there and throw them in the time capsule and then we will

756
00:36:12,980 --> 00:36:15,900
seal it away to open up towards the end of the year.

757
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:18,320
Fruit flavors of the cartridges.

758
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:19,320
Fruit flavored cartridges.

759
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:20,320
No, no, no, no.

760
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:21,320
We don't want that.

761
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:22,320
All right.

762
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:25,160
Um, so yeah, let's go ahead and get those last few down.

763
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:27,180
So Loki, what are you writing now?

764
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:28,180
I've got three.

765
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:29,180
All right.

766
00:36:29,180 --> 00:36:31,820
I bet the online services still shit.

767
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:37,860
Um, no less than two Wii U remakes announced at E3.

768
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:38,860
Okay.

769
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:44,220
Dungeon Buster also suggested that we had our EA and Ubisoft still committed to making

770
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:45,220
games for it.

771
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:46,260
Ooh, I like that one.

772
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:47,300
I like that one.

773
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:49,740
Are EA and Ubisoft still committed to making games for the Switch?

774
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:51,620
Are they committed to the games already?

775
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:54,900
I mean, they were easily committed to the FIFA.

776
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:59,620
So then they come out on stage though and do the whole, just like they did with Wii U.

777
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:00,620
FIFA!

778
00:37:00,620 --> 00:37:01,620
FIFA!

779
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:02,620
All right.

780
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:03,620
That was it.

781
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:04,620
All right.

782
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:05,620
We're going to fill the, I don't want the segment to go on too long.

783
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:08,660
So we're going to get the rest of it out there and put them in the time capsule and

784
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:09,660
seal them away.

785
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:10,660
Date it with today.

786
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:11,660
All right.

787
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:12,660
Well, we'll know when it was done.

788
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:13,660
All right.

789
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:14,660
I'm doing it anyway.

790
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:16,660
It was a couple of days after the Switch was released.

791
00:37:16,660 --> 00:37:17,660
All right.

792
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:19,220
I'm going to pass this down.

793
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:23,000
And then just for fun, I'm not going to tell you what this one is because it really has

794
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:26,580
nothing to do with games, but it's just a question I want to know the answer to.

795
00:37:26,580 --> 00:37:28,380
I want to see if we come back in December.

796
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:31,780
I'll read this question in December when we open the capsule again.

797
00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:33,300
And no, my game won't be done by then.

798
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:37,380
I'll show, I'll show my co-host what I'm going to put in there that has nothing to

799
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:43,580
do with video games, but I'm just going to put that question there to see if come December,

800
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:44,900
we find out what the answer is.

801
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:48,180
I think we should each put in like, though, also, you know, when we add these later, we

802
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:52,260
should also do like our top three things that we're playing this month.

803
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:53,260
Okay.

804
00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:54,260
All right.

805
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:55,900
We should do that on another piece.

806
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:56,900
All right.

807
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:57,900
Let's do that.

808
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:59,020
We won't see all the time capsule yet.

809
00:37:59,020 --> 00:38:02,540
Let's do that when we come back for part B. We'll add those in here as well.

810
00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:04,140
All right.

811
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:11,380
So, I'm going to add that last question in for me and everybody else.

812
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:15,100
This is the best radio ever.

813
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:16,100
I know, right?

814
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:19,300
We should have probably done this before we went live tonight, but that's all right.

815
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:22,820
Oh, sorry Dungeon Buster, we've already put up our papers.

816
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:23,820
All right.

817
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:24,820
Put them in.

818
00:38:24,820 --> 00:38:25,820
Here we go.

819
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:26,820
All right.

820
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:29,820
We're not going to seal the time capsule yet, but soon, because we'll come back and put

821
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:33,620
in the games we're playing right now, a little later.

822
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:34,620
Good Lord Loki.

823
00:38:34,620 --> 00:38:35,620
You could make that smaller pieces.

824
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:36,620
Nope.

825
00:38:36,620 --> 00:38:37,620
All right.

826
00:38:37,620 --> 00:38:38,620
Well, we needed another part for the next question.

827
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:39,620
No, we don't.

828
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:41,620
Well, we have to put in the time capsule.

829
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:44,620
I'll remember what I've been playing, because I'll be playing Skyrim by then.

830
00:38:44,620 --> 00:38:45,620
No, we'll have more.

831
00:38:45,620 --> 00:38:46,620
I have more paper over here.

832
00:38:46,620 --> 00:38:47,620
It's fine.

833
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:48,620
All right.

834
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:49,620
All right.

835
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:50,620
Wasteful.

836
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:51,620
All right.

837
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:54,600
Speaking of things you're playing, let's talk about our gaming weeks.

838
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:55,740
How is your gaming week?

839
00:38:55,740 --> 00:38:57,260
What types of video games have you been playing this week?

840
00:38:57,260 --> 00:38:58,260
Dark soccer.

841
00:38:58,260 --> 00:39:01,260
Well, it's kind of like Dan and I are both playing Breath of the Wild, because he misses

842
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:02,260
a bunch of shit.

843
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:03,260
So I'm like, hey, hubby.

844
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:04,260
Did you see that?

845
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:05,260
Did you see that?

846
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:08,380
I bet you can steal that meat.

847
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:10,420
Try shooting him in the head.

848
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:11,420
You know, it's just like this.

849
00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:13,540
I'm like, no, you're ... Go the other way.

850
00:39:13,540 --> 00:39:16,580
I'm backseat driving Breath of the Wild right now.

851
00:39:16,580 --> 00:39:23,860
And wow, because I want to do the Gul'dan fight so much in every ... Okay.

852
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:27,620
Every time I get in a group, and we get all the way through everybody, and everything's

853
00:39:27,620 --> 00:39:28,620
looking awesome.

854
00:39:28,620 --> 00:39:29,620
And then like, oh, we're tired.

855
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:31,260
We don't want to do this one anymore.

856
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:32,260
Quit.

857
00:39:32,260 --> 00:39:40,120
I want to beat the last ... Anyway, so I've been playing, and I have been playing a lot

858
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:46,180
of Bust-A-Move lately, trying to beat my 2 million point score, which I haven't yet,

859
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:49,860
because eventually I'll just go, oh, fuck this shit, and stop playing.

860
00:39:49,860 --> 00:39:55,340
And Pokemon Go, and Miitomo, just like to make outfits.

861
00:39:55,340 --> 00:39:57,860
I've so far made Katya in it.

862
00:39:57,860 --> 00:40:00,100
I've made Bianca Del Rio.

863
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:01,100
I've made Lonk.

864
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:02,100
I've made Petch.

865
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:03,100
Lonk and Petch.

866
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:07,860
Oh, so I thought you were going to just have a whole drag queen family, but you just did

867
00:40:07,860 --> 00:40:08,860
two.

868
00:40:08,860 --> 00:40:09,860
Yeah, I just did two.

869
00:40:09,860 --> 00:40:10,860
All right.

870
00:40:10,860 --> 00:40:11,860
I might make another one, though.

871
00:40:11,860 --> 00:40:15,560
I'm thinking about making Anjina, just because I want a bald me in there.

872
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:16,560
So I don't know.

873
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:21,620
I'm trying to think who else would be totally iconic in appearance.

874
00:40:21,620 --> 00:40:22,620
Maybe Violet Chachki.

875
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:23,620
I don't know.

876
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:28,300
But so far, I just have my favorites, Bianca and Katya.

877
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:32,420
And then, although, okay, other complaint time.

878
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:36,500
There's this person who's making this little tiny me called Alice, and I'm fucking sick

879
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:42,500
of seeing Alice all over the fucking little fashion show crap that they have after you

880
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:43,500
do the closet.

881
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:44,500
Alice, stop.

882
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:47,540
Get a life, girl.

883
00:40:47,540 --> 00:40:49,540
Seriously.

884
00:40:49,540 --> 00:40:52,540
Did Alice go away yet?

885
00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:55,820
All right.

886
00:40:55,820 --> 00:40:56,820
Anything else for game week?

887
00:40:56,820 --> 00:40:57,820
No.

888
00:40:57,820 --> 00:40:58,820
All right.

889
00:40:58,820 --> 00:40:59,820
Loki, how was your game week?

890
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:02,100
It was just basically Skyrim.

891
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:09,020
I played a little bit of Pokemon Go, just to, you know, I don't know, for some reason,

892
00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:14,500
kill time, because I'm in my car and driving relatively slow through an area that's full

893
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:15,500
of Poke stops.

894
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:17,380
You had to get a party Pikachu.

895
00:41:17,380 --> 00:41:21,060
I had to get a party Pikachu, but they don't have party Pikachus, because apparently Niantic's

896
00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:27,740
like, hey, we're going to release this Pikachu hat thing, and now we're going to make Pikachu

897
00:41:27,740 --> 00:41:29,940
never spawn ever again.

898
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:35,300
I finally got my two Pikachus today, and I say two because one, I have to evolve to Raichu.

899
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:38,860
I just had to drive around the neighborhood and just pull over at every Poke stop I knew

900
00:41:38,860 --> 00:41:40,380
of in every park.

901
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:45,940
And finally, at one of the parks where there's a gym, there was a party Pikachu, and then

902
00:41:45,940 --> 00:41:49,660
as I was giving up, I was like, all right, I'm just going to have the one, I just won't

903
00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:50,740
have a Raichu, whatever.

904
00:41:50,740 --> 00:41:54,680
As I was driving home, at my home park here, it was on the radar.

905
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:57,020
There was another party Pikachu, and I was like, yes.

906
00:41:57,020 --> 00:41:59,620
So I was able to get my Pikachus.

907
00:41:59,620 --> 00:42:00,620
Party.

908
00:42:00,620 --> 00:42:01,620
Party.

909
00:42:01,620 --> 00:42:05,900
But then, yeah, in Skyrim, I've been just doing the quest lines.

910
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:11,700
So I finished the Thieves Guild stuff, which those radiant quests are fucking stupid.

911
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:13,060
I'm so glad I'm done with that.

912
00:42:13,060 --> 00:42:17,580
And the fact that they had that actually based, you know, one of the achievements is based

913
00:42:17,580 --> 00:42:22,820
on doing like 20 of those was annoying, because they weren't hard at all.

914
00:42:22,820 --> 00:42:27,900
It was just annoying, because it's random, and you have to do five in each of the holds.

915
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:31,980
And once you get down to that last hold, it's like, all right, I got to quit this.

916
00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:32,980
Do it again.

917
00:42:32,980 --> 00:42:33,980
Quit it.

918
00:42:33,980 --> 00:42:34,980
Do it again.

919
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:35,980
Quit it.

920
00:42:35,980 --> 00:42:36,980
Do it again.

921
00:42:36,980 --> 00:42:37,980
Quit it.

922
00:42:37,980 --> 00:42:38,980
Oh, I finally got one for the hold I need.

923
00:42:38,980 --> 00:42:39,980
It was just irritating.

924
00:42:39,980 --> 00:42:46,140
And then, of course, I also finished the Mages College quest line as well.

925
00:42:46,140 --> 00:42:48,700
So I'm just going through some of that stuff.

926
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:52,900
So next, I'll be doing the Dark Brotherhood, and maybe I'll finally do the mainline stuff.

927
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:53,900
I don't know.

928
00:42:53,900 --> 00:42:54,900
But, yeah.

929
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:55,900
That's it.

930
00:42:55,900 --> 00:42:57,260
All right.

931
00:42:57,260 --> 00:43:01,180
My gaming week, up until Friday, was pretty much a lot of the same old stuff I've been

932
00:43:01,180 --> 00:43:06,540
playing, like Final Fantasy XIV still, Overwatch, playing a little bit of that still, trying

933
00:43:06,540 --> 00:43:11,300
to get my loot box bonuses, forcing myself to play capture the flag mode, even though

934
00:43:11,300 --> 00:43:12,300
I really don't like it.

935
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:16,460
But I did it once on PlayStation 4 and once on PC to get my extra loot boxes.

936
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:21,220
So I kind of found that if I do Lucio and capture the flag, I don't feel so freaking

937
00:43:21,220 --> 00:43:24,340
useless because I'm healing.

938
00:43:24,340 --> 00:43:26,300
I'm decent enough with Lucio.

939
00:43:26,300 --> 00:43:30,140
I just can't really screw around with characters that are just fun to play right now.

940
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:32,100
I like playing Sombra for fun.

941
00:43:32,100 --> 00:43:33,980
I'm not really good with her.

942
00:43:33,980 --> 00:43:34,980
Same thing with Ana.

943
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:37,300
I like playing Ana for fun, even though I'm not really good with her.

944
00:43:37,300 --> 00:43:41,180
But Lucio, the nice thing is the healing thing is more like an aura, so you don't really

945
00:43:41,180 --> 00:43:42,180
have to think...

946
00:43:42,180 --> 00:43:45,380
He's kind of a little easier to play for that, so I feel like I'm more effective playing

947
00:43:45,380 --> 00:43:47,500
with Lucio.

948
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:51,820
But then the other character I find that I'm getting better and better with, who I really

949
00:43:51,820 --> 00:43:55,900
didn't like at first, but now as I'm playing with her more, I'm really getting to like

950
00:43:55,900 --> 00:44:00,300
her is Mei, because I keep getting her in Mystery Heroes, and I can actually stay alive

951
00:44:00,300 --> 00:44:02,820
as Mei for a little while.

952
00:44:02,820 --> 00:44:07,980
Just being the covert Mei that everybody freaking hates coming up behind people, freeze!

953
00:44:07,980 --> 00:44:08,980
And then...

954
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:09,980
I want to cosplay.

955
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:10,980
I'm going to cosplay her.

956
00:44:11,780 --> 00:44:12,780
You should.

957
00:44:12,780 --> 00:44:13,780
I'm going to cosplay her.

958
00:44:13,780 --> 00:44:14,780
It's a cute outfit.

959
00:44:14,780 --> 00:44:15,780
In the winter.

960
00:44:15,780 --> 00:44:17,180
In the winter, yes.

961
00:44:17,180 --> 00:44:18,180
So that was that.

962
00:44:18,180 --> 00:44:20,700
And then of course, Friday, Nintendo Switch.

963
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:23,460
So I've been playing this weekend.

964
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:25,500
Just a little bit of fast racing remix.

965
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:29,700
I just jumped into that just a little bit, probably not enough to really talk about impressions

966
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:34,460
except for, yes, it's fast, and it looks very nice.

967
00:44:34,460 --> 00:44:38,380
I can tell it's a little better than the Wii U one, even though not like a huge difference,

968
00:44:38,380 --> 00:44:39,380
but you know, enough.

969
00:44:39,860 --> 00:44:42,700
But then I've been spending a lot of time this weekend with Zelda Breath of the Wild,

970
00:44:42,700 --> 00:44:47,580
which you know, it really is a pretty tremendous game.

971
00:44:47,580 --> 00:44:51,780
I mean, it's just, the scope of the game is gigantic.

972
00:44:51,780 --> 00:44:55,620
Like you just don't even really believe it at first, because you start in this one little

973
00:44:55,620 --> 00:44:59,140
area and you're like, oh, okay, this is like going to be the world that I'm playing in

974
00:44:59,140 --> 00:45:00,140
right here.

975
00:45:00,140 --> 00:45:03,300
And then you realize, oh no, that's just one little blip on the giant map.

976
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:06,260
It's like, oh shit.

977
00:45:06,260 --> 00:45:10,740
The interesting thing about Breath of the Wild that I'm finding is the whole, like,

978
00:45:10,740 --> 00:45:14,340
how there's more than one way to solve a puzzle type of thing.

979
00:45:14,340 --> 00:45:16,780
That's very, very interesting.

980
00:45:16,780 --> 00:45:21,340
And I know there's a lot that's inspired by Zelda 1, because you might remember from the

981
00:45:21,340 --> 00:45:25,900
original original Zelda, the original Zelda didn't handhold you a whole lot.

982
00:45:25,900 --> 00:45:28,860
You kind of had to go find level one, obviously level one's easy.

983
00:45:28,860 --> 00:45:30,780
You had to go find level two, find level three.

984
00:45:30,780 --> 00:45:31,780
You could play them out of order.

985
00:45:31,780 --> 00:45:32,780
Yeah, you could.

986
00:45:32,780 --> 00:45:33,780
Well...

987
00:45:33,780 --> 00:45:34,780
Mostly.

988
00:45:34,780 --> 00:45:35,780
Mostly.

989
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:37,300
You could play out of order.

990
00:45:37,300 --> 00:45:38,300
There were a couple you could play out of order.

991
00:45:38,300 --> 00:45:41,620
Like usually you would like, you have to get the raft to go to the next level and then

992
00:45:41,620 --> 00:45:42,620
you get...

993
00:45:42,620 --> 00:45:47,060
There's some like that, but there are a few, like I would think the first three, you don't

994
00:45:47,060 --> 00:45:48,620
need anything.

995
00:45:48,620 --> 00:45:49,620
Maybe bombs.

996
00:45:49,620 --> 00:45:50,940
No, you need bombs to beat some of the bosses.

997
00:45:50,940 --> 00:45:51,940
But anyway, like...

998
00:45:51,940 --> 00:45:56,660
You can go through the whole game without the sword until you get to the last level.

999
00:45:56,660 --> 00:45:57,660
Yes.

1000
00:45:57,660 --> 00:45:59,060
And there are different ways to exploit it and so forth.

1001
00:45:59,060 --> 00:46:04,400
So you know, and how did we, especially in the second quest of Zelda, where it's like

1002
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:09,580
you had to burn the fucking right tree or bomb just the right rock to find levels.

1003
00:46:09,580 --> 00:46:13,380
Like you had to really talk to people and compare notes to figure these things out.

1004
00:46:13,380 --> 00:46:18,180
And I see a lot of this in this Zelda game as well, except there might not necessarily

1005
00:46:18,180 --> 00:46:20,940
be just one way to do it.

1006
00:46:20,940 --> 00:46:24,520
Like I was talking a little bit about this on Bobby's show.

1007
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:27,800
One way to survive the cold might be to cook a meal.

1008
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:29,100
That's how I did it.

1009
00:46:29,100 --> 00:46:30,820
Or you can find an item.

1010
00:46:30,820 --> 00:46:34,440
That's how Shane did it when we were comparing notes talking on the phone.

1011
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:38,240
We might be to skin an enemy and wear his skin and coat.

1012
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:41,760
You have to cook their teeth and do an elixir or something.

1013
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:46,760
There's different ways to solve the problem, which kind of throws you off at first because

1014
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:50,940
sometimes we're used to video games being so linear that there's only one way, one solution

1015
00:46:50,940 --> 00:46:51,940
to the problem.

1016
00:46:51,940 --> 00:46:53,460
But Zelda is really not like that.

1017
00:46:53,460 --> 00:46:58,960
And even Zelda, once you complete the beginning area, the little, I guess, tutorial area,

1018
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:03,620
for lack of a better term, once you beat that little area, you can go straight to the castle

1019
00:47:03,620 --> 00:47:05,220
and try to beat the game.

1020
00:47:05,220 --> 00:47:09,940
It's probably not going to go well for you, but theoretically you're supposed to be able

1021
00:47:09,940 --> 00:47:11,540
to go to the castle and do what you need to do.

1022
00:47:11,540 --> 00:47:15,680
I just, I don't know if it would really be possible without ultimate precision, but that's

1023
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:20,340
going to be the real fun to watch speed runners do later on.

1024
00:47:20,340 --> 00:47:23,180
So anyway, yeah, there's just, there's more than one way to do things.

1025
00:47:23,180 --> 00:47:29,040
And so, yeah, you really just kind of sit back and just enjoy the ride and just exploring

1026
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:30,240
these different areas.

1027
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:34,720
And there's that very Skyrim element to it where it's like in Skyrim, it's, oh, there's

1028
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:35,760
this side dungeon.

1029
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:36,760
What's going to be in here?

1030
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:38,800
Well, now it's, oh, there's this shrine.

1031
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:43,440
What's going to be over in here and, oh, I can chop down this tree or pick these plants

1032
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:45,680
or what can I cook?

1033
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:47,600
What do you mean nobody's going to tell me what to cook?

1034
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:48,820
Like I just have to figure it out.

1035
00:47:48,820 --> 00:47:53,040
If I mix these ingredients together, I'm going to get this, or I compare notes with friends

1036
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:54,500
or I go online.

1037
00:47:54,500 --> 00:47:57,180
That's part of the Breath of the Wild experience.

1038
00:47:57,180 --> 00:48:04,480
But it's, it's, I think it is a truly an amazing accomplishment of a game.

1039
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:05,880
Probably going to be the game of the year.

1040
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:07,620
I should have put that in the time capsule.

1041
00:48:07,620 --> 00:48:11,260
So a Zelda game of the year, because it probably already is.

1042
00:48:11,260 --> 00:48:15,620
And the interesting thing to me is that honestly, I think probably the way I would describe

1043
00:48:15,620 --> 00:48:21,180
Zelda Breath of the Wild is it's probably the best video game of the last generation

1044
00:48:21,180 --> 00:48:23,120
because it is a Wii U game after all.

1045
00:48:23,120 --> 00:48:25,920
It's the best video game of the last generation.

1046
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:27,780
It's probably where this game is going to end up.

1047
00:48:27,780 --> 00:48:31,440
So it's an interesting, interesting way to kick off the Switch.

1048
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:36,080
But yeah, I mean, it's a stellar, stellar game and you don't even, I don't even think

1049
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:40,480
you need to be a huge Zelda fan to be into it because it doesn't really play a lot like

1050
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:41,680
the other Zeldas to me.

1051
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:44,780
I've always been a little eh with 3D Zeldas.

1052
00:48:44,780 --> 00:48:47,240
Like I didn't get into Ocarina of Time the way everybody did.

1053
00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:50,480
I know that's like sacrilege in some circles, but I didn't get into that.

1054
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:53,140
Yeah, the only one I've ever gotten into was Wind Waker.

1055
00:48:53,140 --> 00:48:56,380
Uh, I liked Wind Waker HD and Twilight Princess on the Wii.

1056
00:48:56,380 --> 00:48:59,700
I don't know if that was just the novelty of the Wii or all that, but that Twilight

1057
00:48:59,700 --> 00:49:03,660
Princess kind of held my attention for a while for the 3D Zeldas and I really enjoyed that

1058
00:49:03,660 --> 00:49:04,660
when it came out.

1059
00:49:04,660 --> 00:49:05,660
But yeah.

1060
00:49:05,660 --> 00:49:07,580
Uh, let's see.

1061
00:49:07,580 --> 00:49:13,060
Looking in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com, Dark Tetsuya says the reviews I've seen it's

1062
00:49:13,060 --> 00:49:14,900
getting nines and tens all over the place.

1063
00:49:14,900 --> 00:49:15,900
Yeah.

1064
00:49:15,900 --> 00:49:17,540
I mean, honestly it, it deserves it.

1065
00:49:17,540 --> 00:49:21,280
And Dark Tetsuya says, yeah, speedrunners have a really weird order of doing the dungeons.

1066
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:25,760
Like if I recall correctly, they start with level three probably in the original Zelda.

1067
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:26,760
Probably.

1068
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:27,760
They probably do.

1069
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:28,760
Uh, come on.

1070
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:33,960
No Gus in chat says, I wish I could find like 20 arrows at a time instead of just five.

1071
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:35,840
There are places you can buy arrows.

1072
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:40,800
So my question is, because this looked absolutely annoying when I saw them talking about it,

1073
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:42,180
is the weapon durability.

1074
00:49:42,180 --> 00:49:44,160
Is that fucking annoying?

1075
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:45,160
Yes.

1076
00:49:45,160 --> 00:49:46,680
I don't have an, I don't have a nice way to say it.

1077
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:47,680
Yes.

1078
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:48,680
It's very annoying.

1079
00:49:48,680 --> 00:49:49,680
Did you get the lightsaber yet?

1080
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:50,680
No.

1081
00:49:50,680 --> 00:49:51,680
It's not the lightsaber.

1082
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:52,680
It's called like the guardian sword.

1083
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:53,680
Oh yes.

1084
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:54,680
That I had, I had it for like five seconds.

1085
00:49:54,680 --> 00:49:55,680
And then it broke.

1086
00:49:55,680 --> 00:49:56,680
Yeah.

1087
00:49:56,680 --> 00:49:57,680
Or the, what?

1088
00:49:57,680 --> 00:49:58,680
The eightfold sword.

1089
00:49:58,680 --> 00:49:59,680
Yeah.

1090
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:00,680
That one was awesome.

1091
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:01,680
And it, it broke like five seconds later.

1092
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:04,080
The durability on the weapons is not so hot.

1093
00:50:04,080 --> 00:50:08,760
And I, I don't know if there's a, because the, see, I got to watch my spoiler.

1094
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:11,360
So I'm going to really try to speak in vague terms.

1095
00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:15,820
One of the other complaints I had in the beginning of the game was you can't even hold more than

1096
00:50:15,820 --> 00:50:20,740
like four shields and with as fast as all these things break, what the F am I going

1097
00:50:20,740 --> 00:50:21,740
to do?

1098
00:50:21,740 --> 00:50:22,940
Like this is, this is crazy talk.

1099
00:50:22,940 --> 00:50:28,300
Well, it turns out there are ways to work with that later on.

1100
00:50:28,300 --> 00:50:30,820
So I'm hoping the weapon thing is the same thing.

1101
00:50:30,820 --> 00:50:36,000
I could swear somebody was saying something on Twitter about that there is either you

1102
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:39,940
buy them or there's like a blacksmith who helps you make stronger ones.

1103
00:50:39,940 --> 00:50:42,120
So maybe some of those issues will be resolved later on.

1104
00:50:42,120 --> 00:50:43,660
I just haven't found the answer to that yet.

1105
00:50:43,660 --> 00:50:44,660
And it is annoying.

1106
00:50:44,660 --> 00:50:48,020
You should get that out of the game in the first place because weapon durability is just

1107
00:50:48,020 --> 00:50:52,060
an artificial way to inflate the length of the game.

1108
00:50:52,060 --> 00:50:55,260
Well, yes and no, I would say yes to that.

1109
00:50:55,260 --> 00:51:00,620
If the game didn't hand out new weapons like candy, like the monsters will drop weapons

1110
00:51:00,620 --> 00:51:03,980
and you can pick that weapon up and beat the shit out of them with that weapon.

1111
00:51:03,980 --> 00:51:08,340
And, and that's that in some case with their own arm and yes, in some cases with their

1112
00:51:08,340 --> 00:51:09,340
own arm.

1113
00:51:09,340 --> 00:51:13,740
Um, and that, that also, by the way, that whole thing is really part of what makes this

1114
00:51:13,740 --> 00:51:18,940
Zelda game quite tremendous is that like the detail that goes into that, like when

1115
00:51:18,940 --> 00:51:24,620
you go and if you actually like pick up a weapon that's a monster was using, they'll

1116
00:51:24,620 --> 00:51:27,500
actually point and go, what are you doing?

1117
00:51:27,500 --> 00:51:28,500
Like that whole time.

1118
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:31,980
And they go, they scream at you like they throw it straight into their eyes.

1119
00:51:31,980 --> 00:51:34,860
And that's when you throw it straight into their eye or you throw a bomb at them or something

1120
00:51:34,860 --> 00:51:35,860
like that.

1121
00:51:35,860 --> 00:51:41,340
And just, yeah, like the detail on the monsters and the way they kind of react to different

1122
00:51:41,340 --> 00:51:42,340
situations.

1123
00:51:42,340 --> 00:51:46,800
Like you could kind of watch them for a while and it's, it's, it's pretty neat.

1124
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:48,980
Like the level of detail that goes into that.

1125
00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:54,300
So, uh, bonds double 06 says, so it's like border land, Zelda version.

1126
00:51:54,300 --> 00:51:57,820
Um, that's not some Assassin's Creed, not too far off.

1127
00:51:57,820 --> 00:52:00,360
It's that Borderlands is smart and didn't have weapon durability.

1128
00:52:00,360 --> 00:52:03,340
So they win, uh, come on.

1129
00:52:03,340 --> 00:52:05,740
No Gus says there's such a limited inventory though.

1130
00:52:05,740 --> 00:52:08,820
It's just weird having to drop something to pick something else up.

1131
00:52:08,820 --> 00:52:10,420
Yeah, it is a little weird.

1132
00:52:10,420 --> 00:52:13,740
At least the materials don't seem to be limited on inventory.

1133
00:52:13,740 --> 00:52:19,040
So I can pick up all the apples and plants and all that crap to my heart's content.

1134
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:21,720
It really just seems to be the weapons and shields and that type of stuff.

1135
00:52:21,720 --> 00:52:25,500
So, but, uh, I'm enjoying it so far and I definitely want to play more of it.

1136
00:52:25,500 --> 00:52:27,740
Um, that will probably fill my gaming time.

1137
00:52:27,740 --> 00:52:30,060
Uh, although I don't know, a blaster master zero next week.

1138
00:52:30,060 --> 00:52:31,060
I'm really looking forward to that.

1139
00:52:31,060 --> 00:52:32,820
And I really hope that game doesn't let me down.

1140
00:52:32,820 --> 00:52:37,340
Um, but then there's mass effect in three weeks, so we'll see.

1141
00:52:37,340 --> 00:52:38,340
Anyway.

1142
00:52:38,340 --> 00:52:39,340
All right.

1143
00:52:39,340 --> 00:52:40,620
So that was my gaming week.

1144
00:52:40,620 --> 00:52:45,220
Let's get to, uh, some housekeeping, visit on Twitter, twitter.com slash O L R. We're

1145
00:52:45,220 --> 00:52:48,620
also on Facebook, facebook.com slash orange lounge radio.

1146
00:52:48,620 --> 00:52:52,420
Um, I don't think we have any shows scheduled off for a bit.

1147
00:52:52,420 --> 00:52:55,420
Uh, we'll, we'll still be here over the next few weeks.

1148
00:52:55,420 --> 00:52:57,480
Um, yeah, I can't think of it.

1149
00:52:57,480 --> 00:53:00,860
There's no, uh, expos I can think of that we're doing, uh, that I'm going to be gone

1150
00:53:00,860 --> 00:53:05,020
all weekend except for the SAC indie arcade is, is starting to sneak up on us.

1151
00:53:05,020 --> 00:53:06,160
That's April 8th.

1152
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:08,820
So that's like a month away at this point.

1153
00:53:08,820 --> 00:53:09,820
Wow.

1154
00:53:09,820 --> 00:53:10,820
And now I'm working on Saturdays.

1155
00:53:10,820 --> 00:53:11,820
Oh no.

1156
00:53:11,820 --> 00:53:15,020
You don't have to be able to do it with us.

1157
00:53:15,020 --> 00:53:16,020
Oh shit.

1158
00:53:16,020 --> 00:53:17,020
I didn't even think of that.

1159
00:53:17,020 --> 00:53:19,700
Not unless I can come up, figure something out.

1160
00:53:19,700 --> 00:53:20,700
All right.

1161
00:53:20,700 --> 00:53:23,700
Well at least Loki and I'll be, Oh, you hope you're there or we're going to have room.

1162
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:24,700
I got to get away from the kids.

1163
00:53:24,700 --> 00:53:25,700
Yes.

1164
00:53:25,700 --> 00:53:26,700
I'll be there.

1165
00:53:26,700 --> 00:53:29,540
The only two Saturdays that I were able to get off for to go see drag queens.

1166
00:53:29,540 --> 00:53:34,060
Well, I'm seeing Bianca Del Rio and I'm going to the thing that they canceled in December

1167
00:53:34,060 --> 00:53:36,660
or because of all the weather.

1168
00:53:36,660 --> 00:53:39,140
Well, we'll, we'll see, we'll see.

1169
00:53:39,140 --> 00:53:43,180
Hopefully our soccer can make it, but if not, it's April 8th is the, uh, indie arcade and

1170
00:53:43,180 --> 00:53:45,340
Loki and I'll, we'll be there for sure.

1171
00:53:45,340 --> 00:53:49,140
Hopefully our soccer or we'll have to get a stand in, uh, for that day.

1172
00:53:49,140 --> 00:53:50,140
See what happens.

1173
00:53:50,140 --> 00:53:51,140
Yeah.

1174
00:53:51,140 --> 00:53:52,940
Uh, we'll be broadcasting from the event over in West Sacramento.

1175
00:53:52,940 --> 00:53:55,700
Uh, so we had a lot of fun doing that the past couple of years.

1176
00:53:55,700 --> 00:53:57,860
So I'm really looking forward to this year as well.

1177
00:53:57,860 --> 00:54:02,100
Uh, so look forward to that, but otherwise I'm not traveling for anything until like

1178
00:54:02,100 --> 00:54:03,100
dragon cons.

1179
00:54:03,100 --> 00:54:04,100
The first thing on my agenda.

1180
00:54:04,540 --> 00:54:07,900
I don't think I have, Oh, mag West is supposed to be a thing too.

1181
00:54:07,900 --> 00:54:10,460
That's technically the week before dragon con.

1182
00:54:10,460 --> 00:54:13,100
Um, but I don't have all the details on mag West yet.

1183
00:54:13,100 --> 00:54:15,620
So two more to come on that.

1184
00:54:15,620 --> 00:54:17,660
Let's get into some other gaming news.

1185
00:54:17,660 --> 00:54:21,380
There's still a lot that happened this week outside of GDC and the switch, right?

1186
00:54:21,380 --> 00:54:22,380
Yeah, there was.

1187
00:54:22,380 --> 00:54:25,900
And then I was actually kind of surprised cause I was doing research on other stuff

1188
00:54:25,900 --> 00:54:30,200
when I read this and I was like, Holy shit, this is pretty awesome.

1189
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:33,420
So Microsoft announced this Xbox game pass.

1190
00:54:33,420 --> 00:54:39,140
It's a nine 99 a month service for Xbox one and PC that allows you to play a rotating

1191
00:54:39,140 --> 00:54:45,060
catalog of downloadable, um, Xbox one and backwards compatible Xbox three 60 games.

1192
00:54:45,060 --> 00:54:50,460
I didn't even realize you can play the Xbox three 60 games on the PC.

1193
00:54:50,460 --> 00:54:51,460
I didn't eat.

1194
00:54:51,460 --> 00:54:54,860
Well, you can do the whole streaming thing from your Xbox one.

1195
00:54:54,860 --> 00:54:55,940
I have done that.

1196
00:54:55,940 --> 00:54:59,460
I was playing dungeon siege three that way cause they were getting that away at one point

1197
00:54:59,460 --> 00:55:01,900
how that works with some of these other ones, you know, whatever.

1198
00:55:01,900 --> 00:55:03,280
Um, what the case may be.

1199
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:09,520
So basically it's a rotating, a catalog of a hundred titles from all different publishers,

1200
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:15,580
a two K Capcom, Sega Bandai Namco, THQ, deep silver, you know, blah, blah, blah.

1201
00:55:15,580 --> 00:55:19,880
And some of the games they're kind of showing in their little graphic here, they have like

1202
00:55:19,880 --> 00:55:27,760
halo five saints row, four mad max NBA, two K 16, uh, Lego Batman three, you know, it

1203
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:29,760
looks like some pretty decent titles.

1204
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:35,980
Um, it's going to be, you know, cycled out each month, so there'll be titles that rotate

1205
00:55:35,980 --> 00:55:36,980
out of there.

1206
00:55:36,980 --> 00:55:43,600
Um, it is basically said it's, um, I don't think you need to have Xbox live gold, but

1207
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:49,520
if you do have gold, you get, um, you can get to try this out before it actually launches.

1208
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:54,320
And then along with that too, they're going to be offering DLC a little bit cheaper if

1209
00:55:54,320 --> 00:55:55,520
you do subscribe to this.

1210
00:55:55,520 --> 00:55:59,700
So you'll be getting discounts off of, um, I think also probably full purchases of games

1211
00:55:59,700 --> 00:56:00,920
as well.

1212
00:56:00,920 --> 00:56:06,040
But honestly that is way better than fucking PlayStation now, as far as I'm concerned.

1213
00:56:06,040 --> 00:56:10,000
Well, I was about to ask, what's the difference between the two, but PlayStation now is all

1214
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:11,920
PlayStation three and older stuff, right?

1215
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:13,720
There's nothing newer on it, right?

1216
00:56:13,720 --> 00:56:14,720
Older games.

1217
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:17,160
And this is not streaming.

1218
00:56:17,160 --> 00:56:18,160
This is downloading.

1219
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:19,160
Yeah.

1220
00:56:19,160 --> 00:56:20,160
Okay.

1221
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:22,800
So you can download it and play it off your hard drive and you don't need to be connected.

1222
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:27,360
In fact, I believe they said, you know, you just need to connect once a month to, you

1223
00:56:27,360 --> 00:56:29,800
know, keep utilizing those games.

1224
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:31,120
I think that's fantastic.

1225
00:56:31,120 --> 00:56:35,520
That's the perfect Netflix way to address that.

1226
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:38,520
Why Sony hasn't done that beyond me.

1227
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:42,320
I mean, I think this is how they should treat, you know, well, this is going to light a fire

1228
00:56:42,320 --> 00:56:43,320
for Sony to respond.

1229
00:56:43,320 --> 00:56:48,120
That'll be definitely, they've been like kicking ass as far as backwards compatibility support.

1230
00:56:48,120 --> 00:56:52,760
And now this service, I think that's pretty, that's a great revenue source and hello.

1231
00:56:52,760 --> 00:56:58,720
Fucking Nintendo, dude, you have this catalog of like hundreds of virtual console games.

1232
00:56:58,720 --> 00:57:01,400
You can't tell me you can't put out a service like this.

1233
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:03,680
Are you saying that your games are worse, more than this shit?

1234
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:09,640
I mean, to be fair, we don't know yet because virtual console, they might, I highly doubt

1235
00:57:09,640 --> 00:57:10,640
it.

1236
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:15,220
I say that as I'm holding back laughter, but they technically Loki, we don't know.

1237
00:57:15,220 --> 00:57:18,440
Technically we don't know because virtual console is now yet and they haven't announced

1238
00:57:18,440 --> 00:57:22,240
what the virtual plan, a console plans are on the switch yet specifically.

1239
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:26,860
So they could do a Netflix style model still, and we don't know about it, but I know we're

1240
00:57:26,860 --> 00:57:30,040
all kind of looking at it going, well, we all know what's going to happen to Rob.

1241
00:57:30,040 --> 00:57:33,780
It's going to be five bucks again, unless maybe you get a credit for owning it before

1242
00:57:33,780 --> 00:57:37,840
you can upgrade to a dollar and maybe the new little thing is that it has online.

1243
00:57:37,840 --> 00:57:43,080
I think that's what we're all anticipating, but Hey, if this whole move that Microsoft

1244
00:57:43,080 --> 00:57:47,760
is doing forces Nintendo to do a response, I kind of think Nintendo doesn't, I kind of

1245
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:51,720
think Nintendo can get away with doing what they've been doing as far as virtual console

1246
00:57:51,720 --> 00:57:52,720
goes.

1247
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:58,680
I, I, I'm not thrilled about it either, but I, I think Nintendo can get away with it and

1248
00:57:58,680 --> 00:57:59,680
they will.

1249
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:02,200
Of course they will.

1250
00:58:02,200 --> 00:58:06,160
So and I probably am, aren't helping because I'll probably buy a lot of those games, at

1251
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:07,320
least the ones I want to play again.

1252
00:58:07,320 --> 00:58:10,080
See now this won't be something that I'll be picking up, right?

1253
00:58:10,080 --> 00:58:13,300
You know, well I don't have an Xbox one, so it's definitely not something to be paying

1254
00:58:13,300 --> 00:58:17,160
for right away, but it might be something I'd be interested in maybe.

1255
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:22,400
Although then again, I do have a back catalog of over, you know, 200 games or about 200

1256
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:26,440
games on the PlayStation and 500 games on Steam.

1257
00:58:26,440 --> 00:58:30,560
Yeah, I probably should play through some of those first before I'm getting more older

1258
00:58:30,560 --> 00:58:31,560
games.

1259
00:58:31,560 --> 00:58:34,600
And plus a lot of these that are showing in the rotation there were included in those

1260
00:58:34,600 --> 00:58:40,440
like, you know, PlayStation plus, um, the Xbox live games of gold and stuff like that.

1261
00:58:40,440 --> 00:58:43,120
So I may already have those in my catalog.

1262
00:58:43,120 --> 00:58:48,660
Like I have NBA two K 16 on PlayStation, not that I'm really interested in playing it,

1263
00:58:48,660 --> 00:58:49,660
but I've got it.

1264
00:58:49,660 --> 00:58:50,660
Saints are a four.

1265
00:58:50,660 --> 00:58:53,160
I bought, you know, Halo five would be fun.

1266
00:58:53,160 --> 00:58:57,080
I think where this is going to really prove itself useful is that like, let's say you

1267
00:58:57,080 --> 00:59:03,820
buy like a grand kid or a kid or whatever, like their first Xbox one console or something.

1268
00:59:03,820 --> 00:59:08,180
This is a great way to have like an instant library of games to like catch up on stuff.

1269
00:59:08,180 --> 00:59:12,540
I think that's where this is going to really, and it's probably where Microsoft's being

1270
00:59:12,540 --> 00:59:18,480
smart with it because they want to lure more people and new people into Microsoft's, uh,

1271
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:19,580
you know, library.

1272
00:59:19,580 --> 00:59:22,020
So this is a, this is a really neat way.

1273
00:59:22,020 --> 00:59:23,020
And look at it this way.

1274
00:59:23,020 --> 00:59:28,580
If you're like budget conscious, $10 a month is really not all that much.

1275
00:59:28,580 --> 00:59:29,580
Not that bad.

1276
00:59:29,580 --> 00:59:30,580
That's like lunch.

1277
00:59:30,580 --> 00:59:31,700
I mean, that's, it's really not that bad.

1278
00:59:31,700 --> 00:59:35,740
And I mean, if you're not looking to play like the newest, greatest thing.

1279
00:59:35,740 --> 00:59:36,740
How much is the EA thing?

1280
00:59:36,740 --> 00:59:40,500
Isn't the eighth EA thing like 20 is like much more than that.

1281
00:59:40,500 --> 00:59:42,220
I want to say it's at least like 20 bucks.

1282
00:59:42,220 --> 00:59:43,660
Does somebody in chat know the answer to that?

1283
00:59:43,660 --> 00:59:44,660
How much is the EA thing?

1284
00:59:44,660 --> 00:59:48,420
Yeah, I can look it up, but I want to see there's as much more than that.

1285
00:59:48,420 --> 00:59:52,920
And that's kind of, I would assume no EA games on this service because EA wants you to use

1286
00:59:52,920 --> 00:59:55,460
their more expensive thing for the EA game.

1287
00:59:55,460 --> 00:59:56,980
I don't see EA on there.

1288
00:59:56,980 --> 01:00:00,860
Um, I do see everybody else, but EA.

1289
01:00:00,860 --> 01:00:01,860
What a shot.

1290
01:00:01,860 --> 01:00:03,700
I don't care, honestly.

1291
01:00:03,700 --> 01:00:05,700
Not missing it.

1292
01:00:05,700 --> 01:00:07,300
All right.

1293
01:00:07,300 --> 01:00:09,260
Uh, Jamie checking in with you real quick.

1294
01:00:09,260 --> 01:00:16,300
Do you think there's a market for this type of Netflix style Xbox gaming thing?

1295
01:00:16,300 --> 01:00:17,300
I guess.

1296
01:00:17,300 --> 01:00:23,900
I mean, Netflix itself came really popular and killed Blockbuster.

1297
01:00:23,900 --> 01:00:28,220
Netflix has the, even though we keep saying it's Netflix of games and stuff, it's like,

1298
01:00:28,220 --> 01:00:32,900
it's the old Netflix of games because now I think Netflix has enough of its own original

1299
01:00:32,900 --> 01:00:33,900
stuff.

1300
01:00:33,900 --> 01:00:37,260
And that's, Netflix kind of knew it to their credit, kind of knew they had to go there.

1301
01:00:37,260 --> 01:00:39,780
It's $4.99.

1302
01:00:39,780 --> 01:00:41,340
The EA thing is only $4.99?

1303
01:00:41,340 --> 01:00:42,900
$4.99 a month.

1304
01:00:42,900 --> 01:00:43,900
Okay.

1305
01:00:43,900 --> 01:00:49,500
Well, $4.99 a month, one publisher versus $9.99 a month, a lot of publishers.

1306
01:00:49,500 --> 01:00:52,100
Well, Stan corrected and apologized to EA.

1307
01:00:52,100 --> 01:00:54,240
I thought it was a lot more money when I went in there and looked.

1308
01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:57,780
Maybe I was looking at some type of like three month pricing or something, but I'm okay with

1309
01:00:57,780 --> 01:00:58,780
it.

1310
01:00:58,780 --> 01:01:02,740
I mean, it'd be interesting, but I think a lot of people still like, you know, owning

1311
01:01:02,740 --> 01:01:04,660
their thing too.

1312
01:01:04,660 --> 01:01:05,660
That's very true.

1313
01:01:05,660 --> 01:01:07,540
$4.99 a year.

1314
01:01:07,540 --> 01:01:10,140
Oh, maybe that was something I was looking at.

1315
01:01:10,140 --> 01:01:11,140
All right.

1316
01:01:11,140 --> 01:01:12,140
Anyway.

1317
01:01:12,140 --> 01:01:17,820
Um, still, I don't know if I myself would buy something like this, you know, just because

1318
01:01:17,820 --> 01:01:22,620
I'm kind of like where, what Jamie said is that some people kind of like to own it and

1319
01:01:22,620 --> 01:01:26,220
I feel like the games that are going to be in this are not going to be the newest stuff,

1320
01:01:26,220 --> 01:01:28,660
which is usually going to be the stuff that I'm going to end up buying anyway.

1321
01:01:28,660 --> 01:01:34,140
It's kind of like, I don't know, you know, when I was back, back when I had like the

1322
01:01:34,140 --> 01:01:39,060
NES and the super NES, I was not all gung ho about owning stuff.

1323
01:01:39,060 --> 01:01:42,300
It was just renting it then playing it and then being done with it.

1324
01:01:42,300 --> 01:01:46,620
I think there's a lot of games that you could just get that experience where you just burned

1325
01:01:46,620 --> 01:01:48,580
through it and then you're done with it.

1326
01:01:48,580 --> 01:01:50,580
There's not a lot of replayability on them.

1327
01:01:50,580 --> 01:01:52,220
That's a good point.

1328
01:01:52,220 --> 01:01:53,220
We'll see.

1329
01:01:53,220 --> 01:01:56,980
Uh, bonds, double O six and chat over at live.vog network.com says they won't get money for

1330
01:01:56,980 --> 01:01:57,980
me.

1331
01:01:57,980 --> 01:01:58,980
I'm sorry.

1332
01:01:58,980 --> 01:02:02,260
Ninty and Sony 59 a year is enough for online features.

1333
01:02:02,260 --> 01:02:06,740
Brad from pod culture pointing out Blockbuster killed Blockbuster, unnecessary 100 Matt saying,

1334
01:02:06,740 --> 01:02:11,960
I'm sure come there E3 direct, we will know hopefully a lot more.

1335
01:02:11,960 --> 01:02:12,960
So we'll see.

1336
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:17,300
Um, I, it sounds very interesting and I'd like to know exactly, you know, what that

1337
01:02:17,300 --> 01:02:21,260
list of games is going to ultimately end up being when it first comes out.

1338
01:02:21,260 --> 01:02:25,220
Um, I don't know if there's, I'm kind of like you, Loki, I have a big enough backlog as

1339
01:02:25,220 --> 01:02:30,740
it is like, I would be, I would be amazed with myself if I actually am able to take

1340
01:02:30,740 --> 01:02:33,860
the time to beat Zelda breath of the wild before something else comes out.

1341
01:02:33,860 --> 01:02:34,860
Yeah.

1342
01:02:34,860 --> 01:02:36,460
And I already have like a few EA tiles.

1343
01:02:36,460 --> 01:02:40,440
Like I was looking at the other day, I was like, maybe I should install need for speed

1344
01:02:40,440 --> 01:02:42,860
on my system or dragon age inquisition.

1345
01:02:42,860 --> 01:02:48,980
I have these like games today, my catalog, they just haven't played to register participation

1346
01:02:48,980 --> 01:02:52,280
for this week's episode of orange lounge radio at vog network.com.

1347
01:02:52,280 --> 01:02:53,940
Use the passphrase trunk.

1348
01:02:53,940 --> 01:02:57,880
All right, well moving on, let's get back to the switch for a minute because there's

1349
01:02:57,880 --> 01:02:59,660
some other things going on.

1350
01:02:59,700 --> 01:03:02,940
Maybe not just necessarily in the U S with the switch, you know, we talked a little bit

1351
01:03:02,940 --> 01:03:06,780
about the U S has switched lineup, but, uh, in other countries, the lineup is a little

1352
01:03:06,780 --> 01:03:07,780
bit different.

1353
01:03:07,780 --> 01:03:13,600
And, uh, on the switch over in Japan, there's a game called voice or voice.

1354
01:03:13,600 --> 01:03:18,500
I think it might be pronounced like voice or something voice, uh, it's V O E Z is the

1355
01:03:18,500 --> 01:03:19,500
game.

1356
01:03:19,500 --> 01:03:20,500
It's a rhythm music game.

1357
01:03:20,500 --> 01:03:25,460
So right up our alley here at, uh, O L R there's 116 songs in this game and it's in Japan with

1358
01:03:25,460 --> 01:03:28,380
the console's launch, but yours was interesting about the game.

1359
01:03:28,380 --> 01:03:30,740
You can't play it in TV mode.

1360
01:03:30,740 --> 01:03:33,780
The game is only for tablet mode.

1361
01:03:33,780 --> 01:03:37,860
The reason why, because it's a touch screen music game.

1362
01:03:37,860 --> 01:03:40,580
And when you're on the TV, there's no touch screen.

1363
01:03:40,580 --> 01:03:42,680
There's no more infrared sensor bar or whatever.

1364
01:03:42,680 --> 01:03:46,780
So you can't even really use motion controllers like a pseudo mouse or something like that

1365
01:03:46,780 --> 01:03:47,780
to emulate touchscreen.

1366
01:03:47,780 --> 01:03:48,780
I know.

1367
01:03:48,780 --> 01:03:49,780
Right.

1368
01:03:49,780 --> 01:03:50,780
So that's gone.

1369
01:03:50,780 --> 01:03:55,100
So, uh, interesting that there are going to be games available on switch that will only

1370
01:03:55,100 --> 01:03:56,660
be in the tablet mode.

1371
01:03:56,660 --> 01:04:00,860
And you do see this, like even if you're browsing through the eShop, there's little icons that

1372
01:04:00,860 --> 01:04:04,220
show you in what modes the game is playable.

1373
01:04:04,220 --> 01:04:06,620
And one of them is the dock with the controller.

1374
01:04:06,620 --> 01:04:10,540
One of them is just the two joy cons disconnected with the screen.

1375
01:04:10,540 --> 01:04:13,480
And then the other is with the joy cons attached to the screen.

1376
01:04:13,480 --> 01:04:17,380
So there's different icons that show up and pretty much everything out that's in the U

1377
01:04:17,380 --> 01:04:18,940
S market supports all of them.

1378
01:04:18,940 --> 01:04:20,940
So you don't even really notice it.

1379
01:04:20,940 --> 01:04:24,560
Maybe if you own one, two switch, there's some mini games that will give you a sense

1380
01:04:24,560 --> 01:04:28,440
of this, how not everything can be done in every configuration.

1381
01:04:28,440 --> 01:04:33,620
But it is interesting that here we have a launch title nonetheless that won't play in

1382
01:04:33,620 --> 01:04:35,240
one of the configurations.

1383
01:04:35,240 --> 01:04:41,240
So it probably won't be the last of the switch titles to require the touch pad.

1384
01:04:41,240 --> 01:04:46,720
Kind of interesting, but, um, yeah, I, I don't know again, how many games in the future are

1385
01:04:46,720 --> 01:04:50,480
going to plan to do this, but, uh, we could see a few.

1386
01:04:50,480 --> 01:04:56,120
So, um, I have not seen a lot of this game, but since it is a music game, I'm already

1387
01:04:56,120 --> 01:04:57,400
interested a little bit.

1388
01:04:57,400 --> 01:05:03,920
I do know it has a TBD date for the U S but if you really wanted to get this game again,

1389
01:05:03,920 --> 01:05:07,400
because the Nintendo switch is region free, you can just make an account, you just make

1390
01:05:07,400 --> 01:05:11,600
a second account on your system and set it to Japan or Europe.

1391
01:05:11,600 --> 01:05:14,880
If you want to check out their store, obviously you have to pick a country, but you know,

1392
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:18,280
set it to Germany or, or, you know, something like that.

1393
01:05:19,060 --> 01:05:23,080
And then you can go into their store and get their demos and their games and what have

1394
01:05:23,080 --> 01:05:25,000
you. And apparently it's like really easy to do.

1395
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:29,640
I've even seen people on my friends list that have stuff from the arcade archives, the Neo

1396
01:05:29,640 --> 01:05:31,840
geo stuff that's out in Japan.

1397
01:05:31,840 --> 01:05:32,840
That's not out here.

1398
01:05:32,840 --> 01:05:34,120
I don't know if it was wild arms or something.

1399
01:05:34,120 --> 01:05:35,120
I don't know what it was.

1400
01:05:35,120 --> 01:05:39,340
Is that stuff like integrate with all your other games on like your little home screen

1401
01:05:39,340 --> 01:05:42,320
or does that going to be different based on which account you're logged into?

1402
01:05:42,320 --> 01:05:45,800
No, uh, then once you go back to your U S account, the game shows up there and it shows

1403
01:05:45,800 --> 01:05:49,960
up in your, like, uh, the, the person I'm thinking of is captain spike from game buoy.

1404
01:05:49,960 --> 01:05:55,160
If I go into his profile, you can see that he has the ACA Neo geo stuff right in there

1405
01:05:55,160 --> 01:05:57,680
with Zelda one, two switch, whatever else he's playing.

1406
01:05:57,680 --> 01:06:02,640
That's like, um, PlayStation, I think did that or something.

1407
01:06:02,640 --> 01:06:03,640
Someone did it.

1408
01:06:03,640 --> 01:06:04,640
Yeah.

1409
01:06:04,640 --> 01:06:05,640
I think it was PlayStation.

1410
01:06:05,640 --> 01:06:06,640
Yeah.

1411
01:06:06,640 --> 01:06:08,400
So the region free is working very well, which does kind of beg the question.

1412
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:15,640
So why are we waiting so long to get voice here in the U S does that like English language

1413
01:06:15,640 --> 01:06:16,640
support?

1414
01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:19,760
Apparently you don't need to really understand, uh, Japan.

1415
01:06:19,760 --> 01:06:20,760
Oh yeah.

1416
01:06:20,760 --> 01:06:23,080
The game does have English language support apparently.

1417
01:06:23,080 --> 01:06:24,920
So there's really, yeah, I know.

1418
01:06:24,920 --> 01:06:25,920
Right.

1419
01:06:25,920 --> 01:06:27,580
Is it, could it be a music license thing?

1420
01:06:27,580 --> 01:06:32,100
I don't know if these 116 songs, if any of them are like, you know, Britney Spears type

1421
01:06:32,100 --> 01:06:33,100
of thing.

1422
01:06:33,100 --> 01:06:34,100
So there's music.

1423
01:06:34,100 --> 01:06:35,100
I can't imagine.

1424
01:06:35,100 --> 01:06:40,000
This sounds like a smaller indie title that long to new sharp licensing in other countries.

1425
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:41,000
I would think.

1426
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:42,000
Yeah.

1427
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:43,000
I don't know.

1428
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:44,000
So, Hmm.

1429
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:45,000
Uh, interesting.

1430
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:46,000
Uh, let's see.

1431
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:50,760
Brad from pod culture says, uh, I'm calling it by the time switch to arrives the console

1432
01:06:50,760 --> 01:06:52,760
and the handheld will be one biz.

1433
01:06:52,760 --> 01:06:54,440
No more game boy slash DS.

1434
01:06:54,440 --> 01:06:58,120
You're going to have to wait for the next time capsule next year, Brad.

1435
01:06:58,120 --> 01:06:59,480
All right.

1436
01:06:59,480 --> 01:07:02,160
Anyhow, uh, we'll keep you up to date.

1437
01:07:02,160 --> 01:07:06,120
I'm not really going to go and make a Japanese account just to get this game.

1438
01:07:06,120 --> 01:07:10,040
Um, cause there's plenty else to play right now, but I will be curious to check it out

1439
01:07:10,040 --> 01:07:13,960
when it does come out in the U S meanwhile, dark Sakura.

1440
01:07:13,960 --> 01:07:16,680
Another game we're looking forward to at least you and I are, even if everybody else

1441
01:07:16,680 --> 01:07:19,920
has some soft core space porn.

1442
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:20,920
Okay.

1443
01:07:20,920 --> 01:07:23,760
Well, it's just mass effect Andromeda.

1444
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:28,160
I mean, but we knew that there was going to be alien stripping going on.

1445
01:07:28,160 --> 01:07:29,160
Right.

1446
01:07:29,160 --> 01:07:40,040
So, um, there was a, uh, a post by Aaron Flynn, um, regarding, um, the, uh, uh, rating for

1447
01:07:40,040 --> 01:07:41,040
a mass effect Andromeda.

1448
01:07:41,040 --> 01:07:46,000
And there was the note that said, remember we lost the partial nudity rating and got

1449
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:47,480
full nudity.

1450
01:07:47,480 --> 01:07:53,560
Um, so basically he's just going back and forth with the, with the fans and pretty much

1451
01:07:53,560 --> 01:07:54,560
responded.

1452
01:07:54,560 --> 01:07:55,560
Yes.

1453
01:07:55,560 --> 01:07:56,560
It's totally soft core space porn.

1454
01:07:56,560 --> 01:07:57,560
It could be a joke.

1455
01:07:57,560 --> 01:07:59,560
So that means we could get alien Dick.

1456
01:07:59,560 --> 01:08:03,560
There's well, I don't know if it's going to be Dick or, or Bush or anything.

1457
01:08:03,560 --> 01:08:05,200
I think it's going to be dead ass.

1458
01:08:05,200 --> 01:08:06,720
We have alien twat.

1459
01:08:06,720 --> 01:08:09,720
Like we had an, well, like in dragon age with Dorian, right?

1460
01:08:09,720 --> 01:08:11,480
Was Dorian the only one that had booty?

1461
01:08:11,480 --> 01:08:12,480
No.

1462
01:08:12,480 --> 01:08:14,360
But like you totally saw ass.

1463
01:08:14,360 --> 01:08:15,360
There was ass.

1464
01:08:15,360 --> 01:08:17,600
Well you did actually in the first mass effect.

1465
01:08:17,600 --> 01:08:19,040
Was there ass in the first mass effect?

1466
01:08:19,040 --> 01:08:21,160
Um, for the lady romance.

1467
01:08:21,160 --> 01:08:23,140
Oh, see, I never did the lady romance.

1468
01:08:23,140 --> 01:08:27,080
You got shepherd's butt or Liara's butt, depending on who you were going with.

1469
01:08:27,080 --> 01:08:30,320
Liara putting the ass in mass effect.

1470
01:08:30,320 --> 01:08:35,800
I actually did like on my little lol effect thing, I did three cheers for shepherd's butt

1471
01:08:35,800 --> 01:08:38,400
and posted shepherd's butt.

1472
01:08:38,400 --> 01:08:46,520
So yeah, but there was also, um, apparently some really steamy, steamy dialogue and one

1473
01:08:46,520 --> 01:08:50,360
that children shouldn't play under a certain age.

1474
01:08:50,360 --> 01:08:56,720
Um, so yeah, it's, it's going to be, uh, the rating is going to be a little bit more on

1475
01:08:56,720 --> 01:08:58,440
the adult level.

1476
01:08:58,440 --> 01:09:04,640
Um, and it's going to be, uh, giving into what fans want, which is alien shtipping.

1477
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:05,640
Hooray.

1478
01:09:05,640 --> 01:09:07,640
I can't wait.

1479
01:09:07,640 --> 01:09:12,520
Uh, low key alien fucking isn't going to get you over to the mass effect franchise.

1480
01:09:12,520 --> 01:09:13,520
That's a gimmick.

1481
01:09:13,520 --> 01:09:16,480
I mean, I don't know.

1482
01:09:16,480 --> 01:09:22,360
Fucking on a unicorn might give me the play Witcher three, but it's just at the end of

1483
01:09:22,360 --> 01:09:23,360
the day, it's just a gimmick.

1484
01:09:23,360 --> 01:09:27,600
I mean, it's just, I don't know if the game's good.

1485
01:09:27,600 --> 01:09:28,600
Maybe.

1486
01:09:28,600 --> 01:09:29,600
I didn't play any of the other ones.

1487
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:32,560
I just don't really feel the compulsion to play.

1488
01:09:32,560 --> 01:09:33,880
There's enough porn on the internet.

1489
01:09:33,880 --> 01:09:34,880
Okay.

1490
01:09:35,240 --> 01:09:41,000
I don't need to play a game strictly for the soft core pornography, which payoff porn.

1491
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:44,600
I'm just going to say, remember the very first time I played mass effect, I wrote it off

1492
01:09:44,600 --> 01:09:46,080
and I was like, I don't, I'm not into this.

1493
01:09:46,080 --> 01:09:47,080
What is this?

1494
01:09:47,080 --> 01:09:51,960
And it wasn't until years later when Shane sat me down and said, no, you have to watch

1495
01:09:51,960 --> 01:09:54,440
this and made me watch on YouTube.

1496
01:09:54,440 --> 01:10:00,880
The Caden Shepard scene in mass effect three, I was like, I must play this game.

1497
01:10:00,880 --> 01:10:02,280
I must play this entire game.

1498
01:10:02,320 --> 01:10:08,360
I must lose 120 hours of my life to this franchise by playing it start to finish and a worth

1499
01:10:08,360 --> 01:10:09,360
it.

1500
01:10:09,360 --> 01:10:10,360
Thank you very much.

1501
01:10:10,360 --> 01:10:11,360
All right.

1502
01:10:11,360 --> 01:10:16,880
Uh, come on, no, Gus and chat says, I want Justin Trudeau to be a playable character

1503
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:19,080
in ass effect.

1504
01:10:19,080 --> 01:10:23,400
The young Justin Trudeau, that's been making the rounds on a right on Twitter this week.

1505
01:10:23,400 --> 01:10:25,600
I knew he had to have been pretty when he was young.

1506
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:26,600
Cause he's pretty now.

1507
01:10:26,600 --> 01:10:30,600
I was going to say, not that he's bad looking plank.

1508
01:10:30,600 --> 01:10:35,320
That means he's got core strength and that's important.

1509
01:10:35,320 --> 01:10:38,640
All right, moving on Loki, something that's not porn.

1510
01:10:38,640 --> 01:10:42,720
So Twitch is going to start selling games as well.

1511
01:10:42,720 --> 01:10:47,920
Basically what's going to happen is if you're playing a game, you can have it where a developer

1512
01:10:47,920 --> 01:10:51,840
can enable their game to be, um, sold on Twitch.

1513
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:56,280
So like say you see someone playing Overwatch, you can purchase Overwatch, um, developers

1514
01:10:56,280 --> 01:10:58,360
are going to get 70% of the revenue.

1515
01:10:58,360 --> 01:11:01,600
Um, streamers will get 5% of that.

1516
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:06,600
And then companies, I guess Ubisoft and telltale have already signed up.

1517
01:11:06,600 --> 01:11:10,420
They're saying though, the games bought on Twitch can be played through the Twitch launcher

1518
01:11:10,420 --> 01:11:17,200
through the developer slash publishers, existing services such as you play boo.

1519
01:11:17,200 --> 01:11:19,000
You play boo.

1520
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:20,360
That's not a positive.

1521
01:11:20,360 --> 01:11:23,360
Nobody wants to play through you play ever.

1522
01:11:23,360 --> 01:11:30,000
Um, esteem an option because like, boo, why the fuck would I, I mean, I decided to give

1523
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:35,040
money to the, the streamer, which is just throw them like a donation or something if

1524
01:11:35,040 --> 01:11:36,040
you're here and do that.

1525
01:11:36,040 --> 01:11:37,040
But fuck that.

1526
01:11:37,040 --> 01:11:40,040
I am not playing through you play for anything.

1527
01:11:40,040 --> 01:11:41,400
It's vital by Ubisoft games.

1528
01:11:41,400 --> 01:11:43,480
Here's the, here's the other question I have about all that.

1529
01:11:43,480 --> 01:11:49,800
Cause when I was first reading about it, it was only partnered streamers get that 5% kickback.

1530
01:11:49,800 --> 01:11:53,160
I don't know if they went back and changed it because I was like, yeah, it is only partnered

1531
01:11:53,160 --> 01:11:54,360
streamers.

1532
01:11:54,360 --> 01:11:58,120
So that's kind of a, that's kind of a dick.

1533
01:11:58,120 --> 01:11:59,120
Exactly.

1534
01:11:59,120 --> 01:12:01,780
Cause there's a lot of smaller streamers who aren't partnered.

1535
01:12:01,780 --> 01:12:05,280
Why do suddenly they lose out on this?

1536
01:12:05,280 --> 01:12:08,840
I don't understand that difference to drive that whole partnership thing.

1537
01:12:08,840 --> 01:12:10,280
Honestly, you know what?

1538
01:12:10,280 --> 01:12:14,840
5% revenue from something it's, you know what?

1539
01:12:14,840 --> 01:12:15,840
It's going to take a while.

1540
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:16,840
I understand.

1541
01:12:16,840 --> 01:12:19,560
Do, do the YouTube thing where it's, well, don't totally do the YouTube thing cause YouTube

1542
01:12:19,560 --> 01:12:22,960
has its own issues, but the YouTube thing is what you don't get a check until you actually

1543
01:12:22,960 --> 01:12:25,840
make a hundred dollars in revenue type of thing and do that sort of thing for the smaller

1544
01:12:25,840 --> 01:12:26,840
people.

1545
01:12:26,840 --> 01:12:30,120
Then if they're, if they're worried about that, like there's going to be streamers that

1546
01:12:30,120 --> 01:12:35,400
just like don't ever make it, but it just, it just seems silly to, um, or just, you know,

1547
01:12:35,400 --> 01:12:37,200
it's Ubisoft and telltale games.

1548
01:12:37,200 --> 01:12:40,640
Do we really need to ha do you really need to purchase after Twitch?

1549
01:12:40,640 --> 01:12:44,200
Have you not heard of like telltale games or Ubisoft games?

1550
01:12:44,200 --> 01:12:47,000
Just fucking buy them through the respective platforms.

1551
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:48,360
I mean, I don't know.

1552
01:12:48,360 --> 01:12:49,360
What's what's the point.

1553
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:53,200
Do I still get my prime discount if I sell by the games this way?

1554
01:12:53,200 --> 01:12:54,200
Probably not.

1555
01:12:54,200 --> 01:12:55,200
Cause the prime discounts only when it's pre-orders.

1556
01:12:55,200 --> 01:12:56,200
Huh?

1557
01:12:56,200 --> 01:12:57,200
Does it work?

1558
01:12:57,200 --> 01:12:58,600
No, it does work for games that are already out, right?

1559
01:12:58,600 --> 01:13:00,280
I can't, I can't even remember.

1560
01:13:00,280 --> 01:13:03,120
It's been so long since I bought a game after it was already out, but I think when I bought

1561
01:13:03,120 --> 01:13:04,120
I think it's silly.

1562
01:13:04,120 --> 01:13:10,040
I mean like, uh, why would I like if I was going to buy a telltale game through like,

1563
01:13:10,040 --> 01:13:14,040
let's just say Twitch, okay, I'm gonna buy through Twitch.

1564
01:13:14,040 --> 01:13:17,800
I'd just go buy it through Amazon if I was really going to do that since it's the same

1565
01:13:17,800 --> 01:13:18,800
service anyways.

1566
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:20,480
At least then I'd probably get steam code.

1567
01:13:20,480 --> 01:13:23,720
But don't you want to support your favorite streamer?

1568
01:13:23,720 --> 01:13:24,720
You know what?

1569
01:13:24,720 --> 01:13:27,760
There's a lot of ways to support my favorite streamer if I was going to do that.

1570
01:13:27,760 --> 01:13:30,880
And fucking, this is not needed is what it is.

1571
01:13:30,880 --> 01:13:36,600
It's not really needed because if I wanted to support them, what, 5% of a $20 game.

1572
01:13:36,600 --> 01:13:37,800
I mean, what is that?

1573
01:13:37,800 --> 01:13:38,800
Like a buck?

1574
01:13:38,800 --> 01:13:39,800
Yeah.

1575
01:13:39,800 --> 01:13:40,800
Throw them a dollar.

1576
01:13:40,800 --> 01:13:44,240
If you really want to do that or throw them, you can, and plus, plus if you donated or

1577
01:13:44,240 --> 01:13:48,680
subscribe to their channels, I'm like you get extra emoticons or whatever shit that

1578
01:13:48,680 --> 01:13:50,480
they incentivize people with.

1579
01:13:50,480 --> 01:13:56,160
I mean, I think that's more worthwhile than this nonsense where I have to play it through

1580
01:13:56,160 --> 01:13:57,160
you playing it.

1581
01:13:57,160 --> 01:13:59,240
I don't get steam code or some shit like that.

1582
01:13:59,240 --> 01:14:00,240
Fuck that.

1583
01:14:00,240 --> 01:14:01,780
No, I don't think so.

1584
01:14:01,780 --> 01:14:06,680
I've been trying to do more and more streaming lately and build up my presence over on Twitch.

1585
01:14:06,680 --> 01:14:08,160
Cheap plug, Rob Roberts.

1586
01:14:08,160 --> 01:14:11,560
I don't really do the whole donations thing because I don't, I'm still kind of weirded

1587
01:14:11,560 --> 01:14:13,120
out by the whole begging for money thing.

1588
01:14:13,120 --> 01:14:14,200
For me.

1589
01:14:14,200 --> 01:14:17,840
You do what works for you on your streams and the charity streams, of course, obviously

1590
01:14:17,840 --> 01:14:19,960
I think those are great and so forth.

1591
01:14:19,960 --> 01:14:25,840
I still have this weird area to like, do I want to make money off this?

1592
01:14:25,840 --> 01:14:27,440
How do I do it?

1593
01:14:27,440 --> 01:14:32,080
Feeling like I'm giving my viewers what they're paying for type of thing.

1594
01:14:32,080 --> 01:14:36,560
Long story short, if you want to support me, send me food.

1595
01:14:36,560 --> 01:14:37,560
I love food.

1596
01:14:37,560 --> 01:14:38,560
Send me cookies.

1597
01:14:38,560 --> 01:14:42,160
Send me, uh, I'll take Mountain Dew and Doritos.

1598
01:14:42,160 --> 01:14:43,160
Fuck.

1599
01:14:43,160 --> 01:14:44,160
I will.

1600
01:14:44,160 --> 01:14:45,160
Just send me food.

1601
01:14:45,160 --> 01:14:49,680
Or like in the case of this, like we're, let's say Girl Scout cookies are in season, Loki.

1602
01:14:49,680 --> 01:14:53,580
You can do the Samoas or whatever they call them now, but there'll always be Samoas.

1603
01:14:53,580 --> 01:14:56,980
Send me lots of Samoas.

1604
01:14:56,980 --> 01:15:01,400
Or just like put yourself, like get a partner link for Amazon and just fucking link that

1605
01:15:01,400 --> 01:15:05,880
shit in your channel instead and you probably more revenue from that stuff.

1606
01:15:05,880 --> 01:15:08,320
I mean, why, why would you do this?

1607
01:15:08,320 --> 01:15:09,320
I don't know.

1608
01:15:09,320 --> 01:15:15,760
It's just, the only way it makes sense to me is if it's just automatic.

1609
01:15:15,760 --> 01:15:19,760
Like it's like a thing that you can just tick a box or something like that and then when

1610
01:15:19,760 --> 01:15:22,240
you play those games that it just happens to do that.

1611
01:15:22,240 --> 01:15:27,780
But honestly, with the games that are streamed through Twitch, I don't think any of these

1612
01:15:27,780 --> 01:15:31,840
are at the top or even anywhere near at the top of the list.

1613
01:15:31,840 --> 01:15:35,960
Maybe, maybe with, um, you know, the new Ghost Recon game or something like that.

1614
01:15:35,960 --> 01:15:41,800
But yeah, that's kind of a stretch for the rest of those.

1615
01:15:41,800 --> 01:15:42,800
Let's see.

1616
01:15:42,800 --> 01:15:47,280
Uh, some folks in chat over at live.vognetwork.com JD says Girl Scout cookies just ended last

1617
01:15:47,280 --> 01:15:48,280
week.

1618
01:15:48,280 --> 01:15:49,280
Why you gotta go and ruin everything JD?

1619
01:15:49,280 --> 01:15:53,320
Why you gotta go, you gotta just, just take a big fat crap on this show.

1620
01:15:53,320 --> 01:15:54,880
No, I'm just kidding.

1621
01:15:54,880 --> 01:15:59,080
I, aren't they still trying, I know they're still trying to unload those cookies though.

1622
01:15:59,080 --> 01:16:02,320
I've been seeing the statuses on Facebook, like who wants to buy these cookies?

1623
01:16:02,320 --> 01:16:05,640
Uh, let's see, Brad from Paw Culture suggests Stroopwafel.

1624
01:16:05,640 --> 01:16:09,080
Oh, now I like that idea, the Stroopwafel.

1625
01:16:09,080 --> 01:16:14,040
Why not I could do a fund on Twitch to raise alcohol money.

1626
01:16:14,040 --> 01:16:18,920
That's like, it's, it's like that honest, it's that quote unquote honest beggar that

1627
01:16:18,920 --> 01:16:23,520
you see that says, you know, I just want to buy booze.

1628
01:16:23,520 --> 01:16:26,520
You know, I'm gonna, I'm gonna give that guy a dollar cause you know what, he's, he's honest

1629
01:16:26,520 --> 01:16:28,060
about what he's going for.

1630
01:16:28,060 --> 01:16:30,700
So maybe, maybe that's what I need to do on, on Twitch.

1631
01:16:30,700 --> 01:16:32,500
Just beg for alcohol money.

1632
01:16:32,500 --> 01:16:37,540
Uh, come on, Noel Gus suggests that, uh, I'd send Sky some socks.

1633
01:16:37,540 --> 01:16:39,220
Hey, you know, you know what?

1634
01:16:39,220 --> 01:16:43,900
I, socks are awesome, especially like those, like the designer cute socks that you get

1635
01:16:43,900 --> 01:16:46,060
like, like they have sock stores at the mall now.

1636
01:16:46,060 --> 01:16:51,920
I got these, the socks that I'm wearing right now are these weird, like my mother-in-law,

1637
01:16:51,920 --> 01:16:57,180
they went to, uh, Monterey and they brought me back socks for some reason.

1638
01:16:57,180 --> 01:16:59,900
And I was like, what socks?

1639
01:16:59,900 --> 01:17:00,980
I'm like, okay, thank you.

1640
01:17:00,980 --> 01:17:01,980
Thank you.

1641
01:17:01,980 --> 01:17:02,980
That's nice.

1642
01:17:02,980 --> 01:17:06,740
But those socks are fucking comfortable.

1643
01:17:06,740 --> 01:17:08,180
I wear them all the time.

1644
01:17:08,180 --> 01:17:09,180
They're fucking warm.

1645
01:17:09,180 --> 01:17:12,900
Those Donkey Kong socks from Vans are really cute.

1646
01:17:12,900 --> 01:17:15,900
They're not anything special, but man, they are fucking comfortable.

1647
01:17:15,900 --> 01:17:17,100
And why stop at socks?

1648
01:17:17,100 --> 01:17:18,300
Why not underwear too?

1649
01:17:18,300 --> 01:17:21,660
I mean, I'm not going to be able to show that off on Twitch cause that's a violation of

1650
01:17:21,660 --> 01:17:24,660
the terms of service and let's both be thankful for that.

1651
01:17:24,660 --> 01:17:28,860
But you and I'll know a little secret.

1652
01:17:28,860 --> 01:17:32,860
I'm gaming very comfortably this week.

1653
01:17:32,860 --> 01:17:34,860
All right.

1654
01:17:34,860 --> 01:17:36,180
I took it to an awkward place.

1655
01:17:36,180 --> 01:17:37,180
Sorry.

1656
01:17:37,180 --> 01:17:42,780
Let's go to a news about Overwatch, a game that a lot of people are playing on Twitch.

1657
01:17:42,780 --> 01:17:45,980
Are they going to be able to sell Overwatch on Twitch?

1658
01:17:45,980 --> 01:17:46,980
Depends on Blizzard.

1659
01:17:46,980 --> 01:17:50,220
I think, I think eventually they'll probably be like, fuck you guys.

1660
01:17:50,220 --> 01:17:51,220
We don't need you.

1661
01:17:51,660 --> 01:17:53,580
Overwatch sells itself.

1662
01:17:53,580 --> 01:17:56,820
Blizzard has revealed its latest character.

1663
01:17:56,820 --> 01:18:02,780
And as many people thought, the 11 year old girl that builds robots that they introduced

1664
01:18:02,780 --> 01:18:08,300
last week, Effie, she is not the new hero, but she built the robot.

1665
01:18:08,300 --> 01:18:09,300
Who is the hero?

1666
01:18:09,300 --> 01:18:11,540
The new hero is Orisa.

1667
01:18:11,540 --> 01:18:13,100
Orisa not Doomfist.

1668
01:18:13,100 --> 01:18:19,100
A lot of people said, oh, maybe Effie like did something where she was creating something

1669
01:18:19,100 --> 01:18:20,860
to help Doomfist or whatever.

1670
01:18:20,860 --> 01:18:22,340
No, it's actually the opposite.

1671
01:18:22,340 --> 01:18:29,540
Orisa was created to try to, I guess, stop Doomfist because Orisa was attacked by Doomfist.

1672
01:18:29,540 --> 01:18:32,180
And so that's kind of how she fits into the story.

1673
01:18:32,180 --> 01:18:36,660
I actually did play a little bit with Orisa on the test realm and I'm enjoying her as

1674
01:18:36,660 --> 01:18:37,660
a character.

1675
01:18:37,660 --> 01:18:41,660
She almost feels a little overpowered to me, but I think all new characters do at first.

1676
01:18:41,660 --> 01:18:45,300
I was getting into a Twitter discussion about it and I was like, man, her barrier is like

1677
01:18:45,300 --> 01:18:46,640
really strong.

1678
01:18:46,640 --> 01:18:50,620
But then one of my friends was like, how easy would it be as Junkrat to just fire bombs

1679
01:18:50,620 --> 01:18:52,580
right over the barrier or Pharah?

1680
01:18:52,580 --> 01:18:54,460
That barrier ain't going to do shit to a Pharah.

1681
01:18:54,460 --> 01:18:56,060
I was like, oh yeah, these are good points.

1682
01:18:56,060 --> 01:18:59,500
So, you know, people will be kind of thinking of the different counters to Orisa.

1683
01:18:59,500 --> 01:19:03,780
But Orisa is still fun to play and I think will be one of the more fun tank characters

1684
01:19:03,780 --> 01:19:04,780
to play.

1685
01:19:04,780 --> 01:19:05,780
So that's pretty cool.

1686
01:19:05,780 --> 01:19:10,200
Bastion just got a lot of changes too in the most recent update in Overwatch.

1687
01:19:10,200 --> 01:19:14,980
So yeah, Bastion, in fact, may be too powerful.

1688
01:19:14,980 --> 01:19:18,740
Some people complaining and bitching and moaning on the forums because that's what people do.

1689
01:19:18,740 --> 01:19:25,260
The Bastion is almost too powerful and you see Bastion in almost every game at this point.

1690
01:19:25,260 --> 01:19:30,220
So there was actually one of the directors, Jeff Kaplan, from Overwatch actually went

1691
01:19:30,220 --> 01:19:33,340
on to the Battle.net forum to kind of talk about what they were going to do with this.

1692
01:19:33,340 --> 01:19:36,860
He actually said, over the past few nights I've played with and against Bastion.

1693
01:19:36,860 --> 01:19:39,440
My perception is that he's a little too powerful right now.

1694
01:19:39,440 --> 01:19:42,660
In particular, in one match I was playing Bastion and the enemy Tracer was trying to

1695
01:19:42,660 --> 01:19:43,660
hunt me down.

1696
01:19:43,660 --> 01:19:48,060
The Tracer player was clearly a better player than I am, a very skilled individual.

1697
01:19:48,060 --> 01:19:52,400
I relied heavily on myself heal and the Tracer could not finish me off, but I was able to

1698
01:19:52,400 --> 01:19:55,500
kill Tracer in recon mode almost through attrition.

1699
01:19:55,500 --> 01:19:57,180
That part felt wrong to me.

1700
01:19:57,180 --> 01:20:02,300
So interesting that the director gets in there, plays the game and even recognizes, even though

1701
01:20:02,300 --> 01:20:05,540
he's the director, there's people at the game better than he is and that yeah, he should

1702
01:20:05,540 --> 01:20:06,900
have lost that particular round.

1703
01:20:06,900 --> 01:20:11,740
So I think they did make a small Bastion nerf in the most recently micro patch they just

1704
01:20:11,740 --> 01:20:15,660
rolled out in the past couple days and they may do some more fine tuning with Bastion.

1705
01:20:15,980 --> 01:20:20,620
But I mean the biggest thing they did is that Bastion's self heal you can use while moving

1706
01:20:20,620 --> 01:20:24,460
now and like you can pretty much like bring yourself back up to full health as you're

1707
01:20:24,460 --> 01:20:25,520
moving along the map.

1708
01:20:25,520 --> 01:20:27,940
So it's pretty crazy what he can do.

1709
01:20:27,940 --> 01:20:31,580
So I think they need to find like the right medium for that.

1710
01:20:31,580 --> 01:20:33,940
But that's what's going on in Overwatch.

1711
01:20:33,940 --> 01:20:39,100
So all right, moving on, DarkSakura.

1712
01:20:39,100 --> 01:20:45,020
Well something that I think would make, well first of all, number one, it's making me happy

1713
01:20:45,020 --> 01:20:53,460
and it would also make other fans of the series very happy is Danganronpa news, which

1714
01:20:53,460 --> 01:20:56,780
you haven't played any of them yet, have you?

1715
01:20:56,780 --> 01:20:57,780
No I have not.

1716
01:20:57,780 --> 01:20:59,860
I hear you talk about them all the time, but I haven't played them.

1717
01:20:59,860 --> 01:21:08,780
I got Shain in on it because he was wanting something to fill the, great now I can't think

1718
01:21:08,780 --> 01:21:13,100
of it, Phoenix Wright itch and so Danganronpa was it.

1719
01:21:13,100 --> 01:21:19,060
Anyway, Danganronpa V3 is going to be available on PC, they've confirmed.

1720
01:21:19,060 --> 01:21:21,340
Spike Chunsoft has confirmed.

1721
01:21:21,340 --> 01:21:27,860
So that means that it will be out on September 26th for that PS4 and Vita.

1722
01:21:27,860 --> 01:21:34,460
And Spike Chunsoft itself is going to be doing the publishing for PC instead of NIS America,

1723
01:21:34,460 --> 01:21:39,380
who's doing it for the Sony platforms.

1724
01:21:39,380 --> 01:21:45,660
The other games were ported by Abstraction Games who did some pretty good stuff.

1725
01:21:45,660 --> 01:21:51,240
So I'm really excited because I kind of didn't want to play it on something with a controller.

1726
01:21:51,240 --> 01:21:58,420
I much prefer playing the Danganronpa series on my computer because then it's easier to

1727
01:21:58,420 --> 01:22:01,540
pause, I can walk away from it, I don't hurt my hands so much.

1728
01:22:01,540 --> 01:22:04,580
So for me, this is really good news.

1729
01:22:04,580 --> 01:22:10,260
And then it's also easier of course to screenshot, so Danganronpa.

1730
01:22:10,260 --> 01:22:13,660
One of those series I'll get into on a rainy day at some point.

1731
01:22:13,660 --> 01:22:14,660
You should.

1732
01:22:14,660 --> 01:22:17,500
So much stuff to play.

1733
01:22:17,500 --> 01:22:19,100
There's better stuff to play.

1734
01:22:19,100 --> 01:22:23,180
Alright, moving on, just a couple more stories for you guys.

1735
01:22:23,180 --> 01:22:27,100
Then the classic game of the week, ooh and the classic game this week is a pretty good

1736
01:22:27,100 --> 01:22:28,100
one.

1737
01:22:28,100 --> 01:22:32,220
I mean I could say that every week but let's be real, she picks some real stinkers sometimes.

1738
01:22:32,220 --> 01:22:33,900
And purpose.

1739
01:22:33,900 --> 01:22:35,820
This one is a stinker but it's a good one.

1740
01:22:35,820 --> 01:22:36,820
Anyway, I'll leave it at that.

1741
01:22:36,820 --> 01:22:37,820
Loki.

1742
01:22:37,820 --> 01:22:44,100
Alright, so GDC, they announced the new Xbox Live Creators Program.

1743
01:22:44,100 --> 01:22:49,380
So what's kind of different than the current ID at Xbox program that they have right now

1744
01:22:49,380 --> 01:22:52,660
is they're lowering the barrier of entries.

1745
01:22:52,660 --> 01:22:56,640
So right now, and I think this is kind of what they hinted at before were any Xbox to

1746
01:22:56,640 --> 01:22:58,540
be used as a dev kit.

1747
01:22:58,540 --> 01:23:05,780
Anyone with an Xbox One in conjunction with different game engines like Construct 2, MonoGame

1748
01:23:05,780 --> 01:23:14,060
and Unity, you can develop a game for it and the Windows 10 store with Xbox Live's integration

1749
01:23:14,060 --> 01:23:19,780
and they also, with that, they're going to have their own sections in both of those stores.

1750
01:23:19,780 --> 01:23:24,900
Microsoft does not have to provide concept approval for the game in order to appear on

1751
01:23:24,900 --> 01:23:25,900
the store.

1752
01:23:25,900 --> 01:23:26,900
Oh.

1753
01:23:26,900 --> 01:23:27,900
Or, yeah.

1754
01:23:28,260 --> 01:23:33,020
So, yeah, real easy barrier to entry there.

1755
01:23:33,020 --> 01:23:35,500
So are we kind of getting back to the indie game thing then?

1756
01:23:35,500 --> 01:23:38,100
That's what this is starting to sound like, yeah.

1757
01:23:38,100 --> 01:23:43,340
But how do they know, because they used to have the peer review process, right, to kind

1758
01:23:43,340 --> 01:23:44,340
of filter out some of the crap?

1759
01:23:44,340 --> 01:23:46,820
I don't know if they're going to continue to have that.

1760
01:23:46,820 --> 01:23:52,520
I would imagine that maybe they have some sort of review program in there.

1761
01:23:52,520 --> 01:23:57,500
But yeah, you can already sign up for it in developer or Microsoft.com.

1762
01:23:57,500 --> 01:24:00,380
It was the Xbox Live Creators Program.

1763
01:24:00,380 --> 01:24:03,980
Which is why we are out there, because I need to know if this means we're getting Bungee

1764
01:24:03,980 --> 01:24:06,740
Ferret tossing on Xbox One.

1765
01:24:06,740 --> 01:24:10,060
That's what the minute I heard about this and the fact that, oh, it's Xbox One's answer

1766
01:24:10,060 --> 01:24:13,280
to the indie games thing, that was the first question.

1767
01:24:13,280 --> 01:24:17,100
Some of the other differences that are on this between the two different programs, because

1768
01:24:17,100 --> 01:24:20,460
I'm not sure if they're going to keep both programs on there as well.

1769
01:24:20,460 --> 01:24:23,020
Well, indie games is gone or they were there.

1770
01:24:23,020 --> 01:24:24,020
All right.

1771
01:24:24,020 --> 01:24:26,220
I know the indie games is gone, but they had ID at Xbox.

1772
01:24:26,220 --> 01:24:27,860
So there's two different things right now.

1773
01:24:27,860 --> 01:24:31,940
So yeah, I guess you can apply for either one.

1774
01:24:31,940 --> 01:24:37,740
So the Creators Program, for example, the presence on the storefront is a little bit

1775
01:24:37,740 --> 01:24:39,700
more basic.

1776
01:24:39,700 --> 01:24:44,300
The multiplayer is not supported.

1777
01:24:44,300 --> 01:24:47,740
And achievements are not supported.

1778
01:24:47,740 --> 01:24:51,200
Which is, that was all in line with indie games, if I remember right.

1779
01:24:51,200 --> 01:24:54,460
So you could do like leaderboards on indie games, maybe, but that was about it.

1780
01:24:54,460 --> 01:24:55,460
Yeah, multiplayer, though.

1781
01:24:55,460 --> 01:24:56,460
Did they?

1782
01:24:56,460 --> 01:25:01,500
But wait, we heard Xbox Live integration, so that doesn't really seem to jive with that

1783
01:25:01,500 --> 01:25:02,500
article.

1784
01:25:02,500 --> 01:25:06,740
I think it's something like you can do leaderboards, but you can't do like full on frickin' like

1785
01:25:06,740 --> 01:25:07,740
multiplayer at the same time.

1786
01:25:07,740 --> 01:25:09,260
They have multiplayer, though, in indie games.

1787
01:25:09,260 --> 01:25:12,100
Because I remember they have those really shitty Minecraft clones that you could do

1788
01:25:12,100 --> 01:25:13,100
multiplayer in.

1789
01:25:13,100 --> 01:25:14,100
I don't know.

1790
01:25:14,100 --> 01:25:16,100
I mean, it's a neat idea.

1791
01:25:16,100 --> 01:25:20,740
I'd be willing to check it out whenever I get an Xbox One.

1792
01:25:20,740 --> 01:25:24,220
Okay, Bobby's helping out with some of the answers to the question I have about YYR.

1793
01:25:24,220 --> 01:25:28,020
Bobby Blackwell says, he'd have to convert Bungee Ferret tossing to Unity and make it

1794
01:25:28,020 --> 01:25:29,700
a universal Windows app.

1795
01:25:29,700 --> 01:25:30,980
I forgot about that, of course.

1796
01:25:30,980 --> 01:25:34,940
XNA was a whole other language that you could make, so that would be a challenge in itself.

1797
01:25:34,940 --> 01:25:36,500
I get that.

1798
01:25:36,500 --> 01:25:41,420
Bobby continues, you're creating universal Windows program apps with the Xbox One Creators

1799
01:25:41,420 --> 01:25:45,580
Club, not actual Xbox One games, and XNA isn't supported.

1800
01:25:45,580 --> 01:25:50,340
You could do leaderboards only, but not achievements, not sure about online play.

1801
01:25:50,340 --> 01:25:52,020
So okay, that makes a little more sense.

1802
01:25:52,020 --> 01:25:56,060
So this is where basically, but you could put, so hypothetically, you could put Time

1803
01:25:56,060 --> 01:26:00,500
to Car on Xbox One, if you ever finished the fucking thing, because you did it in Unity.

1804
01:26:00,500 --> 01:26:01,500
I could.

1805
01:26:01,500 --> 01:26:03,220
I wouldn't want to.

1806
01:26:03,220 --> 01:26:04,220
But you could.

1807
01:26:04,220 --> 01:26:05,220
I could.

1808
01:26:05,220 --> 01:26:06,220
You could.

1809
01:26:06,220 --> 01:26:07,220
Or I could make just something else for it.

1810
01:26:07,220 --> 01:26:09,220
I mean, yeah.

1811
01:26:09,220 --> 01:26:12,540
I'm going to be very curious, especially now that we're going to be meeting with a ton

1812
01:26:12,540 --> 01:26:15,840
of indie gamers in a month's time, I'm going to be very, I want to poll some of these folks

1813
01:26:15,840 --> 01:26:21,220
to talk about, like, what is this going to mean for them and what they're doing?

1814
01:26:21,220 --> 01:26:22,940
I'm very curious to hear that.

1815
01:26:22,940 --> 01:26:23,940
So, yeah.

1816
01:26:23,940 --> 01:26:24,940
All right.

1817
01:26:24,940 --> 01:26:29,340
Well, we'll see what continues to develop with this and what indie folks we know that

1818
01:26:29,340 --> 01:26:31,940
might take advantage of it.

1819
01:26:31,940 --> 01:26:36,500
One other game that a lot of folks are still playing and getting ready for its sequel,

1820
01:26:36,500 --> 01:26:38,020
which, you know, we know one's happening.

1821
01:26:38,020 --> 01:26:41,440
We just don't know when exactly, but that's Destiny.

1822
01:26:41,440 --> 01:26:46,380
So Destiny is a game that many people are still playing online and having a good time

1823
01:26:46,380 --> 01:26:51,020
with, and some folks were ready for Destiny 2 to come out so they could take all that

1824
01:26:51,020 --> 01:26:55,460
character and all the progress they've built and move it into Destiny 2, except Bungie

1825
01:26:55,460 --> 01:26:59,400
said this week, it's not going to work that way, actually.

1826
01:26:59,400 --> 01:27:06,140
The characters that you made in Destiny 1 will be reset going into the new game.

1827
01:27:06,140 --> 01:27:11,020
So everything you've earned in Destiny, like your money, your points, and all that stuff,

1828
01:27:11,020 --> 01:27:12,700
not going to happen.

1829
01:27:12,700 --> 01:27:18,220
However, if you have, I guess, like, cool outfits and things like that, you can bring

1830
01:27:18,220 --> 01:27:19,720
those over to Destiny 2.

1831
01:27:19,720 --> 01:27:24,600
Some of that stuff will come over as far as the more look type of things.

1832
01:27:24,600 --> 01:27:30,780
But your powers, your possessions, Eververse-related items and currency will be stuck in the first

1833
01:27:30,780 --> 01:27:31,780
game.

1834
01:27:31,780 --> 01:27:32,780
That's it.

1835
01:27:32,780 --> 01:27:36,640
Personalizations, if you got past level 20 and did the Black Garden story mission, that

1836
01:27:36,640 --> 01:27:38,300
will carry over.

1837
01:27:38,300 --> 01:27:43,000
Some people kind of see that as a little harsh reboot, but at the same time, I kind of look

1838
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:44,800
at this and go, it is a separate game, though.

1839
01:27:44,800 --> 01:27:48,500
If Destiny 2 is supposed to be a separate game, they want everybody to start over.

1840
01:27:48,500 --> 01:27:51,540
That's part of the reason I haven't really got back into Destiny myself is because I

1841
01:27:51,540 --> 01:27:55,540
played it in the very beginning and, you know, it was fun, but then I didn't really have

1842
01:27:55,540 --> 01:27:58,300
time for all these expansions and things like that.

1843
01:27:58,300 --> 01:28:01,000
And now it's like, well, I don't really want to get back into it because everybody else

1844
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:02,740
is like so far along.

1845
01:28:02,740 --> 01:28:06,940
So Destiny 2 is going to kind of hit the reset button on that a little bit, I think.

1846
01:28:06,940 --> 01:28:09,260
I guess it's like EverQuest 1 and EverQuest 2, right?

1847
01:28:09,260 --> 01:28:12,720
Your characters didn't really carry over there either, but that ended up being a bad thing

1848
01:28:12,720 --> 01:28:18,000
for EverQuest 2 because a lot of folks wanted to stay behind and play EverQuest 1.

1849
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,880
You could look at Final Fantasy 11 and 14 kind of the same way.

1850
01:28:20,880 --> 01:28:24,120
Not everybody, you know, the two games don't really have anything in common.

1851
01:28:24,120 --> 01:28:28,360
There's some people, not a ton, but some people who stayed behind and would rather play the

1852
01:28:28,360 --> 01:28:30,420
older game.

1853
01:28:30,420 --> 01:28:31,420
But I don't know.

1854
01:28:31,420 --> 01:28:34,360
Destiny is also much different than your other traditional MMOs.

1855
01:28:34,360 --> 01:28:38,520
I don't know if Destiny is going to have that same problem that those other games I mentioned

1856
01:28:38,520 --> 01:28:41,920
had because it's still going to be a very similar type of game.

1857
01:28:41,920 --> 01:28:47,780
So anyway, Kaijuto does bring up an interesting counterpoint, though, going, didn't they

1858
01:28:47,780 --> 01:28:50,940
sell Destiny as this ongoing story that you live in?

1859
01:28:50,940 --> 01:28:53,540
Oh yeah, it was that whole 10-year plan for Destiny.

1860
01:28:53,540 --> 01:28:54,540
Remember that?

1861
01:28:54,540 --> 01:28:59,020
Well, that doesn't sound like it worked out so well.

1862
01:28:59,020 --> 01:29:01,100
Kind of like the PlayStation 4's 10-year life cycle.

1863
01:29:01,100 --> 01:29:03,860
Well, I mean, it sort of worked out.

1864
01:29:03,860 --> 01:29:09,620
I mean, if we want to not consider this new console a new console.

1865
01:29:09,620 --> 01:29:13,700
Here's the thing, too, with Destiny is that they would probably tell you that Destiny

1866
01:29:13,700 --> 01:29:16,260
2 is part of that life cycle.

1867
01:29:16,260 --> 01:29:19,240
And there are some things you're carrying over.

1868
01:29:19,240 --> 01:29:21,420
You're carrying the essence of your...

1869
01:29:21,420 --> 01:29:22,420
Oh, fuck them.

1870
01:29:22,420 --> 01:29:24,340
The essence, Loki.

1871
01:29:24,340 --> 01:29:30,420
The essence, the O'Day character is coming over from the original Destiny.

1872
01:29:30,420 --> 01:29:32,420
That's what you get.

1873
01:29:32,420 --> 01:29:34,940
All right.

1874
01:29:34,940 --> 01:29:35,940
You know what?

1875
01:29:35,940 --> 01:29:41,140
We need to take a trip down memory lane, back to simpler times.

1876
01:29:41,140 --> 01:29:46,220
When there was no expectation of this online system and things that carried over, you play

1877
01:29:46,220 --> 01:29:49,220
the game, you beat it, and then you threw it in the trash.

1878
01:29:49,220 --> 01:29:50,220
Just kidding.

1879
01:29:50,220 --> 01:29:51,220
You didn't do that.

1880
01:29:51,220 --> 01:29:54,540
You put it in the gaming vault where DarkSakura walks into every week to find a game that

1881
01:29:54,540 --> 01:30:01,500
she thinks, hey, look, brats, put down your Switch.

1882
01:30:01,500 --> 01:30:02,500
Why don't you switch?

1883
01:30:02,500 --> 01:30:03,500
I'll switch you.

1884
01:30:03,500 --> 01:30:04,500
I'll switch you.

1885
01:30:04,500 --> 01:30:06,420
Go pick your own Switch.

1886
01:30:06,420 --> 01:30:10,140
And here it is, the classic game of the week, DarkSakura.

1887
01:30:10,140 --> 01:30:12,740
What is the classic game that the kids should be playing this week?

1888
01:30:12,740 --> 01:30:13,740
Night Trap.

1889
01:30:13,740 --> 01:30:14,740
Oh, God.

1890
01:30:14,780 --> 01:30:16,700
Maybe kids actually shouldn't be playing this game.

1891
01:30:16,700 --> 01:30:17,900
No, they shouldn't be playing it.

1892
01:30:17,900 --> 01:30:23,100
Actually, it's really not that great of a game, but it's iconic, I will say.

1893
01:30:23,100 --> 01:30:25,980
Yes, it is a legendary video game, if nothing else.

1894
01:30:25,980 --> 01:30:28,780
Starring the late Dana Plato.

1895
01:30:28,780 --> 01:30:29,780
R.I.P.

1896
01:30:29,780 --> 01:30:36,100
Who had a shithole of life after different strokes, but still.

1897
01:30:36,100 --> 01:30:41,380
It is an interactive movie game that was done by Digital Pictures for the Sega CD, and it

1898
01:30:41,380 --> 01:30:45,380
came out in North America on October 15th, 1992.

1899
01:30:45,380 --> 01:30:51,700
It had ports for the Sega 32X, the 3DO, MS-DOS, and Mac OS.

1900
01:30:51,700 --> 01:30:59,060
It was basically 90 minutes of full motion video that basically the advent of the CD

1901
01:30:59,060 --> 01:31:02,220
ROM pretty much is what made a game like this possible.

1902
01:31:02,220 --> 01:31:09,340
So basically, the plot of the game is that these young women of various states of dress

1903
01:31:09,380 --> 01:31:14,460
are the targets of these things called augurs, who are vampiric kind of beings who want to

1904
01:31:14,460 --> 01:31:16,740
steal their blood.

1905
01:31:16,740 --> 01:31:20,860
And so you have to switch between these different hidden cameras and activate traps to catch

1906
01:31:20,860 --> 01:31:24,300
them to save the women.

1907
01:31:24,300 --> 01:31:29,900
Now the thing that makes this game notable, even though it's not that great of a game,

1908
01:31:29,900 --> 01:31:35,880
is that it was really a source of controversy, because in 1993, people had an even bigger

1909
01:31:35,880 --> 01:31:40,800
stick up their ass, and it was really mature, really mature.

1910
01:31:40,800 --> 01:31:45,280
There was a bathroom scene where the girl's wearing a towel, and she screams for like

1911
01:31:45,280 --> 01:31:49,560
seven minutes with a pipe in her throat, well, the little augur thing.

1912
01:31:49,560 --> 01:31:52,600
They like this hook that goes around your throat, and it looks like it's got a pump

1913
01:31:52,600 --> 01:31:53,600
attached to it.

1914
01:31:53,600 --> 01:31:54,600
Okay, gross, gross, gross.

1915
01:31:54,600 --> 01:31:56,360
Yeah, anyway.

1916
01:31:56,360 --> 01:32:03,000
In the US, it was actually one of the games that contributed to the creation of the ESRB,

1917
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:05,680
the Entertainment Software Rating Board.

1918
01:32:05,680 --> 01:32:10,560
In the UK, it got a 15 rating.

1919
01:32:10,560 --> 01:32:13,700
So basically back to Night Trap, the game itself.

1920
01:32:13,700 --> 01:32:24,200
So you have an undercover agent whose name is Kelly, played by Dana Plato, who has infiltrated

1921
01:32:24,200 --> 01:32:26,080
one of these parties.

1922
01:32:26,080 --> 01:32:32,600
And these women are staying at Mr. and Mrs. Martin's house, and they seem like a normal

1923
01:32:32,600 --> 01:32:36,600
family, but five other girls who had stayed at this house before disappeared, so why other

1924
01:32:36,600 --> 01:32:40,360
people are wanting to go the fuck to this house, I have no idea.

1925
01:32:40,360 --> 01:32:49,300
And so they send in the Sega Control Attack Team, also SCAT, on other systems it was changed

1926
01:32:49,300 --> 01:32:57,960
to Special Control Attack Team, so yes, the SCAT team sends Kelly in, and you are monitoring

1927
01:32:57,960 --> 01:32:59,720
the whole situation through hidden cameras.

1928
01:32:59,720 --> 01:33:03,160
I don't even know how the fuck they got the hidden cameras in the house, but you know,

1929
01:33:03,160 --> 01:33:05,000
a lot of magic.

1930
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:09,080
Finally some actual people too, like the whole first five minutes of this was just watching

1931
01:33:09,080 --> 01:33:14,600
these guys get, fall through trap doors, and fall through curtains and things like that.

1932
01:33:14,600 --> 01:33:17,640
But now we actually, I was like, where's the chicks in bikinis?

1933
01:33:17,640 --> 01:33:18,640
Where's that part?

1934
01:33:18,640 --> 01:33:21,880
And now we're finally at least seeing people, even though these are not.

1935
01:33:21,880 --> 01:33:25,360
I was promised girls in panties, pillow fighting.

1936
01:33:25,360 --> 01:33:30,920
Where is that?

1937
01:33:30,920 --> 01:33:38,840
The game is called the trap em up genre, so you have the events that are going on in different

1938
01:33:38,840 --> 01:33:44,220
areas of the house, and you can only view one at a time, and so you can actually see

1939
01:33:44,220 --> 01:33:49,160
the augers creep into the house, and you have to spot them and use traps to capture them,

1940
01:33:49,160 --> 01:33:58,280
they have to get to certain places and you trigger the trap kinda, I mean, kinda like

1941
01:33:58,280 --> 01:34:03,980
Dragon's Lair, I guess, a little bit, but more like, more timed in certain places, so.

1942
01:34:03,980 --> 01:34:08,680
We need a crossover between this and Five Nights at Freddy's.

1943
01:34:08,680 --> 01:34:09,680
They've gone into the wrong house.

1944
01:34:09,680 --> 01:34:11,680
Five Nights at Scaddy's.

1945
01:34:11,680 --> 01:34:17,280
Anyway, you, the way that you do, actually, I don't think it would be too off from Five

1946
01:34:17,280 --> 01:34:19,840
Nights at Freddy's, just a little bit less interactive.

1947
01:34:19,840 --> 01:34:23,000
You know, it's more scripted, I think, than this, where Five Nights at Freddy's tends

1948
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:25,120
to be a bit more random.

1949
01:34:25,120 --> 01:34:33,720
But anyway, you have access codes that pop up on the screens, and the codes change the

1950
01:34:33,720 --> 01:34:38,120
different parts of the course of the game, so you have to keep the accurate code by listening

1951
01:34:38,120 --> 01:34:45,080
to the different conversations, and so you actually have to play the game multiple times

1952
01:34:45,080 --> 01:34:47,800
to get what these codes are.

1953
01:34:47,800 --> 01:34:54,040
The game is real-time, it cannot be rewound, and if you miss too many of the augurs, the

1954
01:34:54,040 --> 01:34:58,440
game will end, or if certain characters are taken away, or if the host of the slumber

1955
01:34:58,440 --> 01:35:02,320
party disconnects your access to the traps.

1956
01:35:02,320 --> 01:35:06,600
You know, there's even, like, one part where, like, your boss in the control center cans

1957
01:35:06,600 --> 01:35:13,200
you, for sucking, he yells at you for letting all those poor, poor half-naked women die.

1958
01:35:13,200 --> 01:35:14,740
Aw.

1959
01:35:14,740 --> 01:35:21,980
So it was actually filmed in Culver City, three weeks in 1987, and it was originally

1960
01:35:21,980 --> 01:35:29,980
developed for Hasbro's control vision video game system that was codenamed Nemo, and it

1961
01:35:29,980 --> 01:35:33,340
used VHS tapes instead of ROM cartridges.

1962
01:35:33,340 --> 01:35:38,820
But Hasbro discontinued the production, and so the footage went into an archive until

1963
01:35:38,820 --> 01:35:43,060
the founders of Digital Pictures purchased it in 1991.

1964
01:35:43,060 --> 01:35:49,740
So they imported everything over for a CD-ROM format, put it out on the Sega CD, and then

1965
01:35:49,740 --> 01:35:54,820
later there was the 32X, 3DO, and PC versions that had higher quality.

1966
01:35:54,820 --> 01:35:58,900
There also was a Mac OS version.

1967
01:35:58,900 --> 01:36:04,540
You had, for actors in there, you also had, apart from Dana Plato, you had Arthur Burghardt,

1968
01:36:04,540 --> 01:36:08,060
Blake Gibbons, and Andrus Jones, which I don't know what else the fuck they were in.

1969
01:36:08,060 --> 01:36:09,700
I've never heard any of those people.

1970
01:36:09,700 --> 01:36:12,220
I was just looking at the names of the actors, I was like, who are they?

1971
01:36:12,220 --> 01:36:15,100
The only one I recognize is Dana Plato.

1972
01:36:15,100 --> 01:36:20,220
So with the release, basically the mentions of Sega products were removed from the 3DO

1973
01:36:20,220 --> 01:36:28,500
and PC and Mac versions, so they actually replaced some of the videos with the original

1974
01:36:28,500 --> 01:36:34,540
footage that was made for the first release for the Hasbro control vision.

1975
01:36:34,540 --> 01:36:42,120
Some of the other versions were also giving higher quality video, because the Sega CD

1976
01:36:42,120 --> 01:36:47,000
didn't really have the best resolution for video.

1977
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:53,480
The 3DO version had an on-screen map with the color codes for the different rooms.

1978
01:36:53,480 --> 01:37:01,080
The PC and Mac one had a save function within the game, and a pause menu, so you could look

1979
01:37:01,080 --> 01:37:03,560
at the house on the pause menu.

1980
01:37:03,560 --> 01:37:11,560
It also had the documentary called Dangerous Games that was about this game and the controversy

1981
01:37:11,560 --> 01:37:12,560
around it.

1982
01:37:12,560 --> 01:37:23,880
There was also never released footage for the VHS-1 that is viewable on the Sega CD

1983
01:37:23,880 --> 01:37:28,480
version by entering a button code, and the credits will read, In Memory of Steven D.

1984
01:37:28,480 --> 01:37:31,600
Hasenfeld.

1985
01:37:31,600 --> 01:37:37,640
The footage is basically Hasbro executives looking at the original version's scene of

1986
01:37:37,640 --> 01:37:42,640
the crime back in 1987.

1987
01:37:42,640 --> 01:37:49,040
In 2014, the creator of Night Trap said he wanted to re-release it with better resolution

1988
01:37:49,040 --> 01:37:50,040
and gameplay.

1989
01:37:50,040 --> 01:37:56,440
There was a Kickstarter out for it, but the developers said that if it was successful,

1990
01:37:56,440 --> 01:38:02,580
that they would have done other of the Digital Pictures title, or making a sequel to the

1991
01:38:02,580 --> 01:38:03,880
game.

1992
01:38:03,880 --> 01:38:08,960
There is a mobile prototype that showed up on YouTube, but nothing else about it.

1993
01:38:08,960 --> 01:38:13,280
The game actually sold really well, but because of the controversy over it, it only had an

1994
01:38:13,280 --> 01:38:15,600
initial print run.

1995
01:38:15,600 --> 01:38:17,800
It was a best seller in the UK.

1996
01:38:17,800 --> 01:38:26,400
However, ratings themselves were pretty, pretty, I'd say on the low end.

1997
01:38:26,400 --> 01:38:31,240
But it was novel that they were using live actors and that you had to play through the

1998
01:38:31,240 --> 01:38:37,080
game multiple times to see everything, so it had great replayability.

1999
01:38:37,080 --> 01:38:46,840
Electronic Games give them an 89% overall, but EGM, Electronic Games Monthly, gave it

2000
01:38:46,840 --> 01:38:51,760
a really mediocre review.

2001
01:38:51,760 --> 01:38:58,020
It's kind of not so great, really.

2002
01:38:58,020 --> 01:39:02,380
People who have reviewed it since then just really gave it a kind of snore rating.

2003
01:39:02,380 --> 01:39:09,820
And Night Trap was voted the 12th worst video game of all time in an EGM article.

2004
01:39:09,820 --> 01:39:16,700
And yeah, basically, it's just, you know, it wasn't all that great.

2005
01:39:16,700 --> 01:39:21,740
But like I said, still novel for a time, and the big thing about it is the controversy.

2006
01:39:21,740 --> 01:39:32,300
So in 1993, right before Christmas, the game was removed from shelves at Toys R Us and

2007
01:39:32,300 --> 01:39:38,700
KB after they received complaints that were part of, as they figured out after the fact,

2008
01:39:38,700 --> 01:39:44,180
it was a type of telephone campaign, but they still stalked Mortal Kombat and other violent

2009
01:39:44,180 --> 01:39:45,180
games.

2010
01:39:45,180 --> 01:39:53,360
That actually led to a 1993 joint State Judiciary and Government Affairs Committee having a

2011
01:39:53,360 --> 01:39:55,800
hearing on the video games.

2012
01:39:55,800 --> 01:40:00,700
And so basically, it was announced later that there would be a censored version.

2013
01:40:00,700 --> 01:40:07,460
But no, the ones that were co-chairing this was Joseph Lieberman and Herbert Kohl, who

2014
01:40:07,460 --> 01:40:11,860
thought it was shameful, ultra-violent, sick and disgusting, and encouraged an effort to

2015
01:40:11,860 --> 01:40:12,860
trap and kill women.

2016
01:40:12,860 --> 01:40:16,380
Like, people don't know it's a fucking video game.

2017
01:40:16,380 --> 01:40:18,340
But it made, like, all the news everywhere.

2018
01:40:18,340 --> 01:40:23,900
I even remember this, you know, as a teen, you know, that it was in USA Today, it was

2019
01:40:23,900 --> 01:40:29,860
in New York Times, Washington Post, the local papers, it was all over the place.

2020
01:40:29,860 --> 01:40:36,900
And it was also pretty much, I mean, the characters in the games, and this is actually outlined

2021
01:40:36,900 --> 01:40:45,880
in that Dangerous Games documentary that's also in the PC version, is that the producers

2022
01:40:45,880 --> 01:40:51,540
and the cast members said that they thought that it was for the sake of, to prevent the

2023
01:40:51,540 --> 01:40:56,420
trapping and killing of women, and that the blood draining device was intended to look

2024
01:40:56,420 --> 01:40:59,580
unrealistic, which honestly, it looks fucking unrealistic.

2025
01:40:59,580 --> 01:41:04,180
Like I was like, how the fuck is that a thing, really?

2026
01:41:04,180 --> 01:41:10,580
But then, you know, there's no nudity in the game, or no extreme violence.

2027
01:41:10,580 --> 01:41:14,820
But people were saying, oh no, it's really, it's violent, I mean, they might be scantily

2028
01:41:14,820 --> 01:41:16,900
clad, but they weren't fucking naked.

2029
01:41:16,900 --> 01:41:18,980
You know, it's just boobs.

2030
01:41:18,980 --> 01:41:19,980
What the hell.

2031
01:41:19,980 --> 01:41:20,980
Everyone's got boobs.

2032
01:41:20,980 --> 01:41:21,980
There's worse in movies.

2033
01:41:21,980 --> 01:41:22,980
Men have boobs.

2034
01:41:22,980 --> 01:41:23,980
Okay?

2035
01:41:23,980 --> 01:41:24,980
Everyone's got boobs.

2036
01:41:24,980 --> 01:41:31,380
Anyway, there were a lot of people who just thought that it was a really sexist game.

2037
01:41:31,380 --> 01:41:38,820
I mean, yeah, I think that it is a bit, yeah, it's sexist, I mean, it's meant to play on

2038
01:41:38,820 --> 01:41:44,220
the whole horror movie genre with the, you know, girls in pillow fights and bikinis and

2039
01:41:44,220 --> 01:41:45,220
shit like that.

2040
01:41:45,220 --> 01:41:52,220
But at the same time, it wasn't overt, you know, it's not like it was a snuff game, you

2041
01:41:52,220 --> 01:41:53,220
know.

2042
01:41:53,220 --> 01:41:59,220
At any rate, the game did get ported even after the controversy.

2043
01:41:59,220 --> 01:42:09,540
The ports were done in 1994, and later on the MS-DOS and Mac versions were out in 1995.

2044
01:42:09,540 --> 01:42:14,300
They had a different cover on each of them, but all of them had pictures of Dana Plato

2045
01:42:14,300 --> 01:42:19,300
on it, which the Sega CD one was purely illustrated.

2046
01:42:19,300 --> 01:42:22,060
So and that's it, Night Trap.

2047
01:42:22,060 --> 01:42:28,020
I actually really want to see the documentary now though, because I knew about it, but I

2048
01:42:28,020 --> 01:42:29,020
hadn't seen it.

2049
01:42:29,820 --> 01:42:32,620
All right, there it is, your classic game of the week.

2050
01:42:32,620 --> 01:42:34,500
But is it a classic though?

2051
01:42:34,500 --> 01:42:35,500
Night Trap.

2052
01:42:35,500 --> 01:42:38,900
Well, no, it absolutely changed gaming.

2053
01:42:38,900 --> 01:42:44,500
I mean, even though it's a ridiculous freaking game, it did change gaming for better or for worse.

2054
01:42:44,500 --> 01:42:49,860
And that's, you know, one of the things about the classic game segment is not just an outline,

2055
01:42:49,860 --> 01:42:53,380
oh, this game was great, it's an instant classic and blah, blah, blah.

2056
01:42:53,380 --> 01:42:55,580
It's a classic like the Mustang.

2057
01:42:55,580 --> 01:43:01,460
It's also how did it contribute to gaming and I will interspace shitty games that contributed

2058
01:43:01,460 --> 01:43:02,460
to gaming.

2059
01:43:02,460 --> 01:43:03,460
Of course.

2060
01:43:03,460 --> 01:43:04,460
So there you go.

2061
01:43:04,460 --> 01:43:05,460
Of which there's been plenty.

2062
01:43:05,460 --> 01:43:08,900
And this is actually even considered the same genre as Lode Runner.

2063
01:43:08,900 --> 01:43:09,900
Why?

2064
01:43:09,900 --> 01:43:11,260
Because it's a trap game.

2065
01:43:11,260 --> 01:43:12,860
Oh, God.

2066
01:43:12,860 --> 01:43:15,420
That's a stretch in my opinion.

2067
01:43:15,420 --> 01:43:17,340
I guess puzzle games, maybe.

2068
01:43:17,340 --> 01:43:18,340
I don't know.

2069
01:43:18,340 --> 01:43:19,340
Anyway.

2070
01:43:19,340 --> 01:43:20,340
All right.

2071
01:43:20,340 --> 01:43:23,100
There it is, your classic game of the week, Night Trap starring Dana Plato.

2072
01:43:23,100 --> 01:43:24,100
Rest in peace.

2073
01:43:24,140 --> 01:43:25,140
We're going to take a break.

2074
01:43:25,140 --> 01:43:26,660
When we come back from the break, we're going to continue it.

2075
01:43:26,660 --> 01:43:29,420
We're going to finally seal this time capsule away.

2076
01:43:29,420 --> 01:43:32,220
And then we're going to get into some rapid fire news.

2077
01:43:32,220 --> 01:43:36,700
Your calls pretty soon here at Orange Lounge Radio on Skype when we come back after this

2078
01:43:36,700 --> 01:43:39,140
break with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

2079
01:43:45,140 --> 01:43:48,380
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.

2080
01:43:48,380 --> 01:43:53,780
Live tonight, March the 5th of 2017 with episode number 678 of our show already in

2081
01:43:53,780 --> 01:43:54,780
progress.

2082
01:43:54,780 --> 01:43:58,940
Now, I want to give a quick shout out to our pals over at Anime Jam Session, also here

2083
01:43:58,940 --> 01:44:00,220
on the Voice of Geeks Network.

2084
01:44:00,220 --> 01:44:04,060
Now, I falsely said a couple of weeks ago that they were going to be having their 300th

2085
01:44:04,060 --> 01:44:06,580
episode because I figured, well, what comes after 299?

2086
01:44:06,580 --> 01:44:07,580
300.

2087
01:44:07,580 --> 01:44:11,260
Well, I got fooled because they actually had a 299.5.

2088
01:44:11,260 --> 01:44:14,620
And then as Rama said when he called in the show last week, they took a week off.

2089
01:44:14,620 --> 01:44:19,060
But episode 300 is finally happening with Anime Jam Session this Tuesday.

2090
01:44:19,060 --> 01:44:21,540
So y'all should check it out live.

2091
01:44:21,540 --> 01:44:22,540
Be here.

2092
01:44:22,540 --> 01:44:23,540
All right.

2093
01:44:23,540 --> 01:44:24,540
Are you going to check it out, Dark Sakura?

2094
01:44:24,540 --> 01:44:26,540
You need to be there for Ran-chan.

2095
01:44:26,540 --> 01:44:27,540
Maybe.

2096
01:44:27,540 --> 01:44:28,540
Maybe.

2097
01:44:28,540 --> 01:44:31,820
Well, if you can't be here live, there's always the podcast feed.

2098
01:44:31,820 --> 01:44:32,820
Yes.

2099
01:44:32,820 --> 01:44:33,820
You can always check that out.

2100
01:44:33,820 --> 01:44:36,660
All the shows that make up the Voice of Geeks Network, you can check out their podcast feeds

2101
01:44:36,660 --> 01:44:38,940
over at vognetwork.com and all the way to the shows.

2102
01:44:38,940 --> 01:44:41,220
Sometimes work gets in the way, that nasty necessity.

2103
01:44:41,220 --> 01:44:42,220
Oh, yeah.

2104
01:44:42,220 --> 01:44:43,220
That whole thing.

2105
01:44:43,820 --> 01:44:45,420
Man, if only we could just ban work.

2106
01:44:45,420 --> 01:44:46,420
All right.

2107
01:44:46,420 --> 01:44:49,020
Before we get into rapid fire news, we need to finish the time capsule.

2108
01:44:49,020 --> 01:44:52,620
So somebody had that idea of putting in, what is it?

2109
01:44:52,620 --> 01:44:53,620
What are we putting in here?

2110
01:44:53,620 --> 01:44:55,740
The three games we just can't stop playing right now?

2111
01:44:55,740 --> 01:44:56,740
Yeah.

2112
01:44:56,740 --> 01:44:58,020
To see if that changes by the end of the year.

2113
01:44:58,020 --> 01:44:59,020
Yeah.

2114
01:44:59,020 --> 01:45:00,020
All right.

2115
01:45:00,020 --> 01:45:02,020
So even though Loki's like, I don't want to fill it out, then put one-

2116
01:45:02,020 --> 01:45:03,020
What the fuck were we thinking?

2117
01:45:03,020 --> 01:45:06,260
Then put one Skyrim, two Skyrim, three Skyrim.

2118
01:45:06,260 --> 01:45:08,620
You get this tiny piece of paper to write on, Loki.

2119
01:45:08,620 --> 01:45:09,620
All right.

2120
01:45:09,620 --> 01:45:10,620
All right.

2121
01:45:10,620 --> 01:45:11,620
And make sure to sign it because I don't know who's going to do what.

2122
01:45:11,620 --> 01:45:12,620
All right.

2123
01:45:13,020 --> 01:45:16,300
So I'm going to put number one, obviously it will be Final Fantasy 14 because I play

2124
01:45:16,300 --> 01:45:17,300
way too much of that.

2125
01:45:17,300 --> 01:45:22,540
I was going to see if I ever beat Danganronpa 2, which I'm still halfway through.

2126
01:45:22,540 --> 01:45:28,580
Number two, I'm going to put Overwatch because I do play a lot of that with Alan.

2127
01:45:28,580 --> 01:45:32,540
I want to know if Alan's still playing Overwatch 2 at that point.

2128
01:45:32,540 --> 01:45:34,900
Now the third one's a little harder to pick.

2129
01:45:34,900 --> 01:45:36,820
What am I obsessed with right now?

2130
01:45:36,820 --> 01:45:38,980
I'm not sure what I play.

2131
01:45:38,980 --> 01:45:42,500
I mean, like obviously this particular weekend I've been playing a lot of Breath of the

2132
01:45:43,380 --> 01:45:44,380
Wild, but does that count?

2133
01:45:44,380 --> 01:45:45,380
Yeah.

2134
01:45:45,380 --> 01:45:50,540
Can I put number three, overcome with anticipation for Mass Effect Andromeda?

2135
01:45:50,540 --> 01:45:53,220
Maybe we could do a second list of what we're looking forward to this year.

2136
01:45:53,220 --> 01:45:54,220
Okay.

2137
01:45:54,220 --> 01:45:56,220
That time capsule is only so big and we don't want that segment to be our own.

2138
01:45:56,220 --> 01:45:58,220
We'll just use little pieces of paper, Loki.

2139
01:45:58,220 --> 01:45:59,660
Let's see.

2140
01:45:59,660 --> 01:46:10,780
I'm just going to put, um, I'm just going to put number three, um, overcome with feelings

2141
01:46:10,780 --> 01:46:15,980
about Andromeda.

2142
01:46:15,980 --> 01:46:18,980
I'll just put Breath of the Wild, even though I'm not playing that yet.

2143
01:46:18,980 --> 01:46:19,980
But you're not playing it.

2144
01:46:19,980 --> 01:46:20,980
You're cheating.

2145
01:46:20,980 --> 01:46:22,980
But I will be in like a couple of weeks.

2146
01:46:22,980 --> 01:46:23,980
All right.

2147
01:46:23,980 --> 01:46:24,980
All right.

2148
01:46:24,980 --> 01:46:25,980
Overcome with feelings about Andromeda.

2149
01:46:26,300 --> 01:46:33,260
D.S. was the gay sex good?

2150
01:46:33,260 --> 01:46:34,260
Question mark.

2151
01:46:34,260 --> 01:46:37,300
That's an important question I want to answer in December, right?

2152
01:46:37,300 --> 01:46:41,500
I just put OMG Mass Effect Andromeda in big letters, but since I'm playing through Breath

2153
01:46:41,500 --> 01:46:43,660
of the Wild is sort of an afterthought.

2154
01:46:43,660 --> 01:46:44,660
Right.

2155
01:46:44,660 --> 01:46:49,300
Oh, I should, even though I totally know my own handwriting, I will still sign this with

2156
01:46:49,300 --> 01:46:53,060
my name there.

2157
01:46:53,060 --> 01:46:54,300
Fold it up.

2158
01:46:54,300 --> 01:46:55,300
Put it in the time capsule.

2159
01:46:55,620 --> 01:46:56,620
Okay.

2160
01:46:56,620 --> 01:46:57,620
What'd you put on your list?

2161
01:46:57,620 --> 01:46:58,620
Dark Sakura.

2162
01:46:58,620 --> 01:46:59,620
Um, I put World of Warcraft.

2163
01:46:59,620 --> 01:47:00,620
Okay.

2164
01:47:00,620 --> 01:47:01,620
Yeah.

2165
01:47:01,620 --> 01:47:02,620
You have been playing.

2166
01:47:02,620 --> 01:47:06,020
I should specify that it's Legion, although they haven't announced the next, uh, thing.

2167
01:47:06,020 --> 01:47:09,580
They probably will at the next BlizzCon just in time for the end of the year.

2168
01:47:09,580 --> 01:47:12,940
Danganronpa 2, cause I haven't beaten it yet and I'm still trying to.

2169
01:47:12,940 --> 01:47:14,940
And then Breath of the Wild cause Dan and I are doing it together.

2170
01:47:14,940 --> 01:47:17,060
And then in big letters, I did OMG Mass Effect Andromeda.

2171
01:47:17,060 --> 01:47:18,060
Okay.

2172
01:47:18,060 --> 01:47:19,940
So you actually, you actually did put three games.

2173
01:47:19,940 --> 01:47:21,380
Now what'd you put, Loki?

2174
01:47:21,380 --> 01:47:25,060
Skyrim Remastered, Until Dawn, Rush of Blood, and Skyrim Remastered.

2175
01:47:25,060 --> 01:47:26,060
Okay.

2176
01:47:26,060 --> 01:47:27,060
Good enough.

2177
01:47:27,060 --> 01:47:28,060
All right.

2178
01:47:28,060 --> 01:47:29,060
I accept that answer.

2179
01:47:29,060 --> 01:47:30,060
I didn't put my name on there, but I mean.

2180
01:47:30,060 --> 01:47:31,060
Fine.

2181
01:47:31,060 --> 01:47:32,060
We'll deal with it.

2182
01:47:32,060 --> 01:47:33,060
Is it Skyrim?

2183
01:47:33,060 --> 01:47:34,060
We know it's you.

2184
01:47:34,060 --> 01:47:35,060
If it's Skyrim, we know it's you.

2185
01:47:35,060 --> 01:47:36,060
Or Alan snuck one in there.

2186
01:47:36,060 --> 01:47:37,060
All right.

2187
01:47:37,060 --> 01:47:38,060
So here we go.

2188
01:47:38,060 --> 01:47:39,060
Let's make the seal it away.

2189
01:47:39,060 --> 01:47:40,060
Tape it.

2190
01:47:40,060 --> 01:47:41,060
Noises.

2191
01:47:41,060 --> 01:47:42,060
You're sealing it away.

2192
01:47:42,060 --> 01:47:43,060
I don't want to go get tape.

2193
01:47:43,060 --> 01:47:44,060
Tape it.

2194
01:47:44,060 --> 01:47:45,060
Tape it.

2195
01:47:45,060 --> 01:47:47,660
And you know what's funny is as I'm talking to this, I just realized we have a whole like

2196
01:47:47,660 --> 01:47:50,300
Tootsie Roll thing that we're holding the pens in, but this works great.

2197
01:47:50,300 --> 01:47:51,300
But that one doesn't have a lid.

2198
01:47:51,300 --> 01:47:52,300
It doesn't have a lid.

2199
01:47:52,300 --> 01:47:53,780
It doesn't have any Tootsie Rolls in it.

2200
01:47:53,780 --> 01:47:54,780
Where are we?

2201
01:47:54,780 --> 01:47:55,780
Oh yeah.

2202
01:47:55,780 --> 01:47:56,780
Where are we going to put candy?

2203
01:47:56,780 --> 01:47:58,260
We're going to put a Tootsie Roll in there.

2204
01:47:58,260 --> 01:48:01,420
And some of my hair to see what color it is.

2205
01:48:01,420 --> 01:48:02,780
I sealed it away.

2206
01:48:02,780 --> 01:48:04,620
So there's a hole on the top.

2207
01:48:04,620 --> 01:48:05,620
Done.

2208
01:48:05,620 --> 01:48:06,620
All right.

2209
01:48:06,620 --> 01:48:07,620
There it is.

2210
01:48:07,620 --> 01:48:08,620
All right.

2211
01:48:08,620 --> 01:48:09,620
So where am I going to put this now?

2212
01:48:09,620 --> 01:48:10,620
I guess I'll just put it here.

2213
01:48:10,620 --> 01:48:11,620
Yep.

2214
01:48:11,620 --> 01:48:12,620
There.

2215
01:48:12,620 --> 01:48:13,620
It'll sit.

2216
01:48:13,620 --> 01:48:14,620
To be opened December 2017.

2217
01:48:14,620 --> 01:48:15,620
We should cover it with like stickers.

2218
01:48:15,620 --> 01:48:16,620
Like randomly.

2219
01:48:16,620 --> 01:48:17,620
All right.

2220
01:48:17,620 --> 01:48:18,620
There it is.

2221
01:48:18,620 --> 01:48:19,620
Come on.

2222
01:48:19,620 --> 01:48:20,620
No Gus suggests lick it shut.

2223
01:48:20,620 --> 01:48:21,620
No.

2224
01:48:21,940 --> 01:48:24,140
I haven't decided if I'm licking Rob's cartridges yet.

2225
01:48:24,140 --> 01:48:27,980
Apparently I saw a picture of someone's dog that did shoot up one of those cartridges.

2226
01:48:27,980 --> 01:48:29,980
So that stuff doesn't really seem to stop dogs.

2227
01:48:29,980 --> 01:48:31,900
Yeah, but dogs also have weird senses of taste.

2228
01:48:31,900 --> 01:48:32,900
It doesn't affect pets.

2229
01:48:32,900 --> 01:48:33,900
Dogs eat their own shit.

2230
01:48:33,900 --> 01:48:34,900
Okay.

2231
01:48:34,900 --> 01:48:37,200
Well, which is why he was chewing on one, two switch.

2232
01:48:37,200 --> 01:48:39,620
So it is kind of the equivalent of eating shit.

2233
01:48:39,620 --> 01:48:40,620
So that makes sense.

2234
01:48:40,620 --> 01:48:44,000
Uh, it's two one hundred Matt and Chad says, put it up on a shelf that is away from San

2235
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:45,000
Rio.

2236
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:46,000
A, San Rio 17.

2237
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:47,880
She doesn't do that shit anymore.

2238
01:48:47,880 --> 01:48:50,120
But B, we did, I did put it up on a shelf.

2239
01:48:50,560 --> 01:48:54,380
In our studio here, we have an elevated television that we use for the PlayStation three because

2240
01:48:54,380 --> 01:48:58,080
we actually use tune in to listen to Bobby Black Wolf here in studio before the show

2241
01:48:58,080 --> 01:48:59,080
goes live.

2242
01:48:59,080 --> 01:49:03,080
It almost makes me think if you painted that green, it would sort of look like a cactuar.

2243
01:49:03,080 --> 01:49:04,080
It does.

2244
01:49:04,080 --> 01:49:05,080
Like with the little arms sticking out.

2245
01:49:05,080 --> 01:49:06,920
It would look like a cactuar if you painted it green.

2246
01:49:06,920 --> 01:49:12,800
I'm going to put it up on, um, on my, uh, Facebook fan page.

2247
01:49:12,800 --> 01:49:13,800
Jamie Summers on Facebook.

2248
01:49:13,800 --> 01:49:14,920
You have a Facebook fan page?

2249
01:49:14,920 --> 01:49:15,920
I do.

2250
01:49:15,920 --> 01:49:16,920
All right.

2251
01:49:16,920 --> 01:49:17,920
Why wouldn't I?

2252
01:49:17,920 --> 01:49:18,920
You have fans?

2253
01:49:18,920 --> 01:49:19,920
Yeah.

2254
01:49:20,720 --> 01:49:21,720
Y'all need fan pages.

2255
01:49:21,720 --> 01:49:23,720
You don't have fans without a fan page.

2256
01:49:23,720 --> 01:49:24,720
I'm sorry.

2257
01:49:24,720 --> 01:49:25,720
My ego's not that big.

2258
01:49:25,720 --> 01:49:26,720
I have a Twitch.

2259
01:49:26,720 --> 01:49:27,720
You can follow me.

2260
01:49:27,720 --> 01:49:28,720
You can stroke my ego on Twitch.

2261
01:49:28,720 --> 01:49:31,720
I did it because I was doing other shit too.

2262
01:49:31,720 --> 01:49:32,720
That's fair.

2263
01:49:32,720 --> 01:49:33,720
I'm just, I'm just giving you crap.

2264
01:49:33,720 --> 01:49:35,520
Well, you always give me crap.

2265
01:49:35,520 --> 01:49:36,520
Stop crapping.

2266
01:49:36,520 --> 01:49:37,520
All right.

2267
01:49:37,520 --> 01:49:38,520
There we go.

2268
01:49:38,520 --> 01:49:39,520
You kind of need to crap.

2269
01:49:39,520 --> 01:49:40,520
Nevermind.

2270
01:49:40,520 --> 01:49:44,320
Ah, let's get into some rapid fire news and hopefully some non crappy things that happened

2271
01:49:44,320 --> 01:49:45,520
in gaming this week.

2272
01:49:45,520 --> 01:49:46,520
Loki.

2273
01:49:46,520 --> 01:49:47,520
Yes.

2274
01:49:48,120 --> 01:49:52,320
So one of the things during GDC that was talked about was Unreal Engine.

2275
01:49:52,320 --> 01:49:57,320
And of course with that, um, they made some more updates about Fortnite.

2276
01:49:57,320 --> 01:50:01,120
Hey, remember that game that was supposed to be coming out on Unreal Engine 4?

2277
01:50:01,120 --> 01:50:02,120
No.

2278
01:50:02,120 --> 01:50:06,920
It was supposed to be like a zombie survival game that was, you know, building your own

2279
01:50:06,920 --> 01:50:08,820
base and stuff like that.

2280
01:50:08,820 --> 01:50:10,120
So it's still coming.

2281
01:50:10,120 --> 01:50:16,360
Um, it's supposed to be coming out this year on PC according to Tim Sweeney.

2282
01:50:16,360 --> 01:50:17,360
All right then.

2283
01:50:17,400 --> 01:50:19,200
So yeah, we'll look forward to it then.

2284
01:50:19,200 --> 01:50:24,200
Um, something else that's going to be in development as well is Sleeping Dogs, the movie.

2285
01:50:24,200 --> 01:50:29,600
So that's that Hong Kong action, open world action game that they had.

2286
01:50:29,600 --> 01:50:36,360
Um, now it's supposed to, I guess, star, who do they have starring in there?

2287
01:50:36,360 --> 01:50:42,200
Uh, it's being produced by Neil H. Morris, who did the Fast and the Furious, I am Legend

2288
01:50:42,200 --> 01:50:44,320
21 Jump Street.

2289
01:50:44,360 --> 01:50:48,640
And it's going to star Donnie Yen, who is, you know, definitely well known in the Hong

2290
01:50:48,640 --> 01:50:51,760
Kong, um, you know, movie scene.

2291
01:50:51,760 --> 01:51:00,160
It Man, Rogue One, um, and of course, uh, triple X Return of Xander Cage.

2292
01:51:00,160 --> 01:51:01,160
I'm down.

2293
01:51:01,160 --> 01:51:02,160
That'd be pretty awesome.

2294
01:51:02,160 --> 01:51:05,280
That movie or the game was pretty cinematic as it was.

2295
01:51:05,280 --> 01:51:11,960
So I don't need really an excuse to go see Hong Kong action movies.

2296
01:51:11,960 --> 01:51:15,840
Not everyone is excited about it because, you know, in our chat over at live.vog network.com

2297
01:51:15,840 --> 01:51:22,400
says Sleeping Dogs, the movie, no, I feel like I should shake the Vader thing.

2298
01:51:22,400 --> 01:51:23,400
No.

2299
01:51:23,400 --> 01:51:24,400
Shake.

2300
01:51:24,400 --> 01:51:25,400
Shake.

2301
01:51:25,400 --> 01:51:26,400
Shake.

2302
01:51:26,400 --> 01:51:27,400
All right.

2303
01:51:27,400 --> 01:51:28,400
Uh, let's see.

2304
01:51:28,400 --> 01:51:29,400
Um, yeah.

2305
01:51:29,400 --> 01:51:33,960
Uh, I don't know if, uh, it needs a movie, but okay.

2306
01:51:33,960 --> 01:51:36,640
I mean, we could really use a good video game movie.

2307
01:51:36,640 --> 01:51:38,240
That would be nice.

2308
01:51:38,240 --> 01:51:41,000
At least we have some good sportsmanship in the video game world.

2309
01:51:41,040 --> 01:51:45,840
Uh, the switch of course being released on Friday, believe it or not lent to some official

2310
01:51:45,840 --> 01:51:51,280
comments from the PlayStation and the Xbox Twitter accounts that were very nice.

2311
01:51:51,280 --> 01:51:54,760
Uh, the PlayStation account tweeting today's a big day for Nintendo.

2312
01:51:54,760 --> 01:51:55,760
Congrats on launch.

2313
01:51:55,760 --> 01:52:01,800
We can't wait to play with a little blue heart blue cause PlayStation, uh, whereas, uh, Microsoft

2314
01:52:01,800 --> 01:52:05,900
wrote a little tweet on their Xbox account that said at Nintendo, it's not every day

2315
01:52:05,900 --> 01:52:09,360
you get to throw the switch on a new console.

2316
01:52:09,400 --> 01:52:10,400
So, uh, congrats.

2317
01:52:10,400 --> 01:52:12,080
Hashtag Nintendo switch at Nintendo.

2318
01:52:12,080 --> 01:52:14,960
They did a little animation that did like achievement unlocked.

2319
01:52:14,960 --> 01:52:18,780
So even though they were gradually Nintendo, they had a very Microsoft thing and she'd

2320
01:52:18,780 --> 01:52:19,920
been unlocked.

2321
01:52:19,920 --> 01:52:28,240
We have achievements and you don't, that should, now that would have been the classless thing

2322
01:52:28,240 --> 01:52:29,240
to do.

2323
01:52:29,240 --> 01:52:33,200
Uh, Microsoft does what intend don't type of thing to respond, but isn't it nice though

2324
01:52:33,200 --> 01:52:35,600
to see these, this has come a long way.

2325
01:52:35,600 --> 01:52:37,260
What did Denny's and Arby's say?

2326
01:52:37,260 --> 01:52:40,160
That's really what we want to know.

2327
01:52:40,160 --> 01:52:41,160
That's a really good point.

2328
01:52:41,160 --> 01:52:42,880
I think Denny's tweeted one of those pictures.

2329
01:52:42,880 --> 01:52:45,480
It's like, look left, look right.

2330
01:52:45,480 --> 01:52:46,720
You're having an existential crisis.

2331
01:52:46,720 --> 01:52:47,720
There's, I don't know.

2332
01:52:47,720 --> 01:52:48,720
It was really funny.

2333
01:52:48,720 --> 01:52:51,640
I think I retweeted it, but yes, we need to know what did the Arby's account have to say?

2334
01:52:51,640 --> 01:52:52,640
That's the most important.

2335
01:52:52,640 --> 01:52:54,240
Or was it the Sonic account?

2336
01:52:54,240 --> 01:52:55,240
That's very...

2337
01:52:55,240 --> 01:52:56,240
Sonic the Hedgehog.

2338
01:52:56,240 --> 01:52:58,400
Oh, I'm pretty sure they had tweeted something too.

2339
01:52:58,400 --> 01:52:59,400
It's important.

2340
01:52:59,400 --> 01:53:03,400
Uh, anyway, so, uh, also, which I thought was neat, uh, somebody else had tweeted, uh,

2341
01:53:03,400 --> 01:53:08,240
like a reply that said, love when companies congratulate each other, makes it seem like

2342
01:53:08,240 --> 01:53:12,640
we are all united and Xbox replied, it's all for the love of the games with the thumbs

2343
01:53:12,640 --> 01:53:13,640
up emoji.

2344
01:53:13,640 --> 01:53:15,800
So that was nice.

2345
01:53:15,800 --> 01:53:20,200
But also I think the fact that it's Nintendo and you know, obviously Nintendo marches to

2346
01:53:20,200 --> 01:53:21,800
the beat of their own drum.

2347
01:53:21,800 --> 01:53:26,560
And so I think the competition is especially a little lesson there and come on guys.

2348
01:53:26,560 --> 01:53:33,500
I'm sure the people that work at Sony and Microsoft probably play Nintendo.

2349
01:53:33,500 --> 01:53:34,500
You know what?

2350
01:53:34,500 --> 01:53:38,520
I bet the guys at Sony play Xbox and the guys at Microsoft play PlayStation.

2351
01:53:38,520 --> 01:53:42,880
These two companies, they're not worried about Nintendo because they know the last couple

2352
01:53:42,880 --> 01:53:45,720
of generations, it hasn't really eaten into their profits too much.

2353
01:53:45,720 --> 01:53:53,000
They're probably just like, good job, good job, you know, putting out a console, you

2354
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:54,000
know.

2355
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:58,080
But look, the reality is too, that the games industry is like a small place too.

2356
01:53:58,080 --> 01:54:02,160
So like, it's like, okay, look, Sony is not going to write a tweet that says, get fucked

2357
01:54:02,160 --> 01:54:03,160
Nintendo.

2358
01:54:03,160 --> 01:54:09,640
They're not going to write that tweet because then when like, you know, the, the social

2359
01:54:09,640 --> 01:54:13,920
media person at one of these companies wants to go get a job somewhere else, they're going

2360
01:54:13,920 --> 01:54:18,020
to be like, what was up with that tweet you sent to Nintendo that told me to become president

2361
01:54:18,020 --> 01:54:21,440
someday, right?

2362
01:54:21,440 --> 01:54:25,360
That's that's the only time you're going to be able to get away with, you know, as much

2363
01:54:25,360 --> 01:54:30,400
as Trump tweets, he is really missing some, get fucked in there.

2364
01:54:30,400 --> 01:54:36,780
I mean, cause that would just be like, hilarious, hilarious in the fact that like, Oh, Hey,

2365
01:54:36,780 --> 01:54:42,580
there's blue flames coming off of the fire now, uh, dungeon buster and chat over at life.com

2366
01:54:42,580 --> 01:54:46,760
says, if I recall correctly, major Nelson tweeted a picture of breath of the wild saying

2367
01:54:46,760 --> 01:54:50,880
it was for research in quotes, see, it's cute.

2368
01:54:50,880 --> 01:54:57,360
Come on, come on, look, there's a lot of gamers out there like me who are sick and own everything

2369
01:54:57,360 --> 01:54:58,360
anyway.

2370
01:54:58,360 --> 01:54:59,920
So you know what?

2371
01:54:59,920 --> 01:55:00,920
It's a win.

2372
01:55:00,920 --> 01:55:05,600
All right, let's move on to a Marvel and, uh, their, their gaming universe, which of

2373
01:55:05,600 --> 01:55:09,840
course, Marvel versus Capcom infinite is going to be a big release in that universe.

2374
01:55:09,840 --> 01:55:14,240
There's also though, don't forget the whole square Enix, uh, the, uh, crystal dynamics

2375
01:55:14,240 --> 01:55:19,400
square, um, uh, Marvel project that's going on too, which I'm down for because it's Marvel

2376
01:55:19,400 --> 01:55:20,400
cinematic universe.

2377
01:55:20,400 --> 01:55:24,920
And I like the Marvel said, well, actually, apparently Marvel versus Capcom infinite.

2378
01:55:24,920 --> 01:55:29,480
Um, they have the freedom to tell their story and they want to make an original story.

2379
01:55:29,480 --> 01:55:33,440
It is not going to be a part of the cinematic universe.

2380
01:55:33,440 --> 01:55:38,520
Uh, so, uh, Marvel games goal is to not force a games development timeline to match up with

2381
01:55:38,520 --> 01:55:42,360
any upcoming movie, TV show or comic book.

2382
01:55:42,360 --> 01:55:47,020
So these games are not directly tied to the universes in any way.

2383
01:55:47,020 --> 01:55:49,420
They get to do their own thing.

2384
01:55:49,420 --> 01:55:50,420
That makes sense.

2385
01:55:50,420 --> 01:55:53,420
And with that said, I love the Deadpool two teaser.

2386
01:55:53,420 --> 01:55:54,420
That was, I haven't seen it.

2387
01:55:54,420 --> 01:55:57,940
I haven't even seen the Deadpool movie, but to be fair, I haven't seen like any movies.

2388
01:55:57,940 --> 01:55:58,940
I know.

2389
01:55:58,940 --> 01:56:00,660
Watch the Deadpool movie.

2390
01:56:00,660 --> 01:56:01,660
Seriously.

2391
01:56:01,660 --> 01:56:02,660
Go on.

2392
01:56:02,660 --> 01:56:03,660
Last movie I saw in theaters was Warcraft.

2393
01:56:03,660 --> 01:56:05,060
That was almost a year ago.

2394
01:56:05,060 --> 01:56:06,420
Oh God, no.

2395
01:56:06,420 --> 01:56:08,100
So I was bored enough on Saturday.

2396
01:56:08,100 --> 01:56:11,580
I mean, obviously I was playing a lot of Zelda, but you have to come up for air once in a

2397
01:56:11,580 --> 01:56:12,580
while.

2398
01:56:12,580 --> 01:56:13,580
Right?

2399
01:56:13,580 --> 01:56:14,580
So I actually started looking, I was looking at this brand new theater.

2400
01:56:14,580 --> 01:56:18,140
They just opened up with the whole now recliner seats is the big deal, right?

2401
01:56:18,140 --> 01:56:21,700
And they sell booze at theaters and this is an assigned seating thing, right?

2402
01:56:21,700 --> 01:56:25,540
So I went onto the website and I was like, well, I want to see this get out because everybody's

2403
01:56:25,540 --> 01:56:28,340
telling me it's fucking great and it looks good, so I'll go see it.

2404
01:56:28,340 --> 01:56:32,180
So I was just, just for fun, I was going to pitch to Alan, like, let's go see, get out,

2405
01:56:32,180 --> 01:56:33,460
I'll go get us tickets.

2406
01:56:33,460 --> 01:56:39,220
But then as I'm looking online, like completely sold out for seven o'clock completely sold

2407
01:56:39,220 --> 01:56:41,900
out except for like two seats in the front row for 10 o'clock.

2408
01:56:41,900 --> 01:56:45,980
And it's like, now that you can buy your seats online, all this stuff like these things,

2409
01:56:45,980 --> 01:56:49,420
these movies are sold out forever in advance.

2410
01:56:49,420 --> 01:56:52,580
Like you can't just walk up to the theater anymore and go, yeah, I just want to see whatever

2411
01:56:52,580 --> 01:56:53,580
movies coming up next.

2412
01:56:53,580 --> 01:56:54,580
You can't really do that now.

2413
01:56:54,580 --> 01:56:58,700
And I think the fact that all these theaters have giant recliners means there's less seats

2414
01:56:58,700 --> 01:56:59,700
in the theater.

2415
01:56:59,700 --> 01:57:02,780
Um, yeah, they're pretty large.

2416
01:57:02,780 --> 01:57:06,940
So anyway, so no, I did not see, I haven't seen Logan.

2417
01:57:06,940 --> 01:57:11,220
I haven't seen Deadpool, but, but don't take it personally, movie fans.

2418
01:57:11,220 --> 01:57:16,380
I just haven't seen any movies because Alan and I also work the different schedules.

2419
01:57:16,380 --> 01:57:18,820
So it's hard for us to go see movies together.

2420
01:57:18,820 --> 01:57:22,300
You know, it's like when we have the time together, we have to do the really exciting

2421
01:57:22,300 --> 01:57:29,140
things that married folks do and go grocery shopping and go pay bills.

2422
01:57:29,140 --> 01:57:30,820
We don't have time for movies.

2423
01:57:30,820 --> 01:57:31,820
Anyway.

2424
01:57:31,820 --> 01:57:35,060
All right, uh, let's move on.

2425
01:57:35,060 --> 01:57:36,060
More rapid fire news.

2426
01:57:36,060 --> 01:57:37,060
Dark Sakura.

2427
01:57:37,900 --> 01:57:43,220
Ah, if I don't unplug my phone, my, uh, mic here.

2428
01:57:43,220 --> 01:57:44,220
Geez.

2429
01:57:44,220 --> 01:57:47,780
So how about some PlayStation Plus?

2430
01:57:47,780 --> 01:57:50,100
How's that sound?

2431
01:57:50,100 --> 01:57:51,100
Yeah.

2432
01:57:51,100 --> 01:57:57,700
Um, there are going to be free offerings, including a disc jam and tear away unfolded.

2433
01:57:57,700 --> 01:58:08,540
Um, also included is earth defense force 2025 under night in birth exe, I guess late, whatever

2434
01:58:08,540 --> 01:58:14,820
the fuck that is severed for Vita and Lumo for Vita, um, with cross by on PS4.

2435
01:58:14,820 --> 01:58:20,220
Um, this goes live on the seventh, which is to use a day.

2436
01:58:20,740 --> 01:58:28,420
Um, and also Disney stop, stop.

2437
01:58:28,420 --> 01:58:33,500
Disney wants to reboot Tron with Jared Leto.

2438
01:58:33,500 --> 01:58:34,500
Yeah.

2439
01:58:34,500 --> 01:58:39,660
Cause that worked out so well when they put Jared Leto as the joker in suicide squad.

2440
01:58:39,660 --> 01:58:41,100
She wasn't bad as the joker.

2441
01:58:41,100 --> 01:58:45,100
Like Jared Leto is just kinda everywhere.

2442
01:58:45,100 --> 01:58:47,140
I don't, I don't get it.

2443
01:58:47,140 --> 01:58:48,140
It's like one of those things.

2444
01:58:48,140 --> 01:58:53,980
And again, I didn't see suicide squad refer to our earlier conversation now.

2445
01:58:53,980 --> 01:59:01,860
So riddle me this, if Tron legacy, if Tron legacy was so bad that they can't warrant

2446
01:59:01,860 --> 01:59:05,360
a sequel, then why are they rebooting it?

2447
01:59:05,360 --> 01:59:10,500
Why warrant another movie then if it was the whole thing, make the fucking third Tron movie,

2448
01:59:10,500 --> 01:59:12,220
just make that movie.

2449
01:59:12,220 --> 01:59:16,260
Everything I've heard is that star Wars killed Tron.

2450
01:59:16,260 --> 01:59:19,980
When Disney got star Wars, they didn't need Tron anymore, so they threw it away.

2451
01:59:19,980 --> 01:59:24,500
But now it seems like somebody's thinking maybe that wasn't such a good idea that maybe

2452
01:59:24,500 --> 01:59:31,180
gasp both these movies could exist in the same place where Marvel's spitting out two

2453
01:59:31,180 --> 01:59:32,900
or three movies a year.

2454
01:59:32,900 --> 01:59:37,660
Surely Disney can put out two science fiction movies that may I point out are really fucking

2455
01:59:37,660 --> 01:59:38,660
different.

2456
01:59:38,660 --> 01:59:40,620
Are Tron and star Wars that similar?

2457
01:59:40,620 --> 01:59:41,620
I don't fucking think so.

2458
01:59:41,620 --> 01:59:46,740
They left it open to like at the end of legacy for like a really interesting like story.

2459
01:59:46,740 --> 01:59:48,100
Let's just throw that out.

2460
01:59:48,100 --> 01:59:51,740
I had heard this thing that Jared Leto was maybe supposed to be like another character

2461
01:59:51,740 --> 01:59:52,740
in the third.

2462
01:59:52,740 --> 01:59:53,740
I'm totally cool.

2463
01:59:53,740 --> 01:59:54,740
Fine.

2464
01:59:54,740 --> 01:59:55,740
Cool.

2465
01:59:55,740 --> 01:59:59,580
Although I thought they had totally set it up for Cillian Murphy.

2466
01:59:59,580 --> 02:00:00,580
Killian Murphy.

2467
02:00:00,580 --> 02:00:01,580
I forget how to pronounce his name.

2468
02:00:01,580 --> 02:00:05,420
They totally said that guy that played the scarecrow, who was awesome in that original,

2469
02:00:05,420 --> 02:00:07,420
in that first Batman.

2470
02:00:07,420 --> 02:00:10,500
But he was supposed to be the new villain, right?

2471
02:00:10,500 --> 02:00:13,260
He'd set up as the guy from the first movie's kid.

2472
02:00:13,260 --> 02:00:16,260
So he would be the villain in the third movie.

2473
02:00:16,260 --> 02:00:19,500
So I mean, like there, the plot was fucking there.

2474
02:00:19,500 --> 02:00:20,940
Make that movie.

2475
02:00:20,940 --> 02:00:23,940
Why do you need to reboot Tron?

2476
02:00:23,940 --> 02:00:26,340
I don't doesn't make sense.

2477
02:00:26,340 --> 02:00:28,580
It doesn't seem like that would, I mean, I don't know.

2478
02:00:28,580 --> 02:00:37,660
It just just, I, I'm happy if Tron can at least continue somehow, like I'll take a reboot

2479
02:00:37,660 --> 02:00:41,460
over nothing, but I'm not hyped about it.

2480
02:00:41,460 --> 02:00:46,860
Like, if they're worried that too much time has passed since Tron Legacy, they waited

2481
02:00:46,860 --> 02:00:50,020
like 25 years to make Tron Legacy.

2482
02:00:50,020 --> 02:00:54,140
So, so fucking what if like seven years have gone by since Tron Legacy?

2483
02:00:54,140 --> 02:00:55,380
Make a third Tron movie.

2484
02:00:55,380 --> 02:00:56,680
It will be fine.

2485
02:00:56,680 --> 02:00:57,680
And you know what?

2486
02:00:57,680 --> 02:00:58,780
Put a ride at Disney.

2487
02:00:58,780 --> 02:01:03,280
Take the ride from, so I don't have to go to China, take the ride at Shanghai Disney

2488
02:01:03,280 --> 02:01:08,600
and put it at California adventure or something because I want to go on that ride.

2489
02:01:08,600 --> 02:01:13,240
Anyway, Tiger Claw in chat says, maybe that's what the movie is going to be called Tron

2490
02:01:13,240 --> 02:01:15,560
rebooted or Tron reboot.

2491
02:01:15,560 --> 02:01:16,560
Oh, get, get it?

2492
02:01:16,560 --> 02:01:20,280
Cause it's play on computer stuff.

2493
02:01:20,280 --> 02:01:21,360
That's where the confusion was.

2494
02:01:21,360 --> 02:01:26,880
Maybe the third movie is just going to be Tron reboot and Oh, what a mind fuck that

2495
02:01:26,880 --> 02:01:27,880
is.

2496
02:01:27,880 --> 02:01:30,520
If that's the case, maybe that's just the third movie is Tron reboot.

2497
02:01:30,520 --> 02:01:32,720
All right, moving on.

2498
02:01:32,720 --> 02:01:35,520
Let's travel around and look at what's in stores this week.

2499
02:01:35,520 --> 02:01:36,520
Loki.

2500
02:01:36,520 --> 02:01:40,840
Although I wouldn't be too, um, too optimistic about it.

2501
02:01:40,840 --> 02:01:42,800
So this week, uh, not a whole lot.

2502
02:01:42,800 --> 02:01:50,360
Uh, we've got Altair, uh, Furis, the alchemists of, and the mystery, mysterious journey.

2503
02:01:50,360 --> 02:01:53,000
It's on PC, PlayStation four and the Vita.

2504
02:01:53,000 --> 02:02:00,280
Lego worlds out on PC, PlayStation four and Xbox one near automata on PlayStation four

2505
02:02:00,280 --> 02:02:05,880
and Tom Clancy's ghost recon wild lands on PC, PlayStation four and Xbox one.

2506
02:02:05,880 --> 02:02:06,880
That's it.

2507
02:02:06,880 --> 02:02:08,120
All right.

2508
02:02:08,120 --> 02:02:11,040
Let's travel over to Japan and look at what's coming out in Japan.

2509
02:02:11,040 --> 02:02:16,120
Um, this week starting on the, I think the ninth is when all the games hit.

2510
02:02:16,120 --> 02:02:17,120
Yep.

2511
02:02:17,120 --> 02:02:20,220
Kingdom hearts, HD 1.5 and 2.5 remix.

2512
02:02:20,220 --> 02:02:21,220
That's a pretty big deal.

2513
02:02:21,220 --> 02:02:22,880
That's hitting the PlayStation four in Japan this week.

2514
02:02:22,880 --> 02:02:25,200
I'm looking forward to the U S release of that for sure.

2515
02:02:25,200 --> 02:02:26,800
Uh, let's see.

2516
02:02:26,840 --> 02:02:31,040
Croylier Sigma comes out in Japan this week on PlayStation four, let it die.

2517
02:02:31,040 --> 02:02:33,440
Gets an uncle prime edition in Japan this week.

2518
02:02:33,440 --> 02:02:35,800
I'm assuming because that's a free to play game.

2519
02:02:35,800 --> 02:02:39,240
There's some type of box diversion that comes with game credit or something like that.

2520
02:02:39,240 --> 02:02:43,200
There's a green camouflage colored controller coming out this week as well for the PlayStation

2521
02:02:43,200 --> 02:02:47,720
four and ultimate Marvel versus Capcom three gets a Japanese release this week.

2522
02:02:47,720 --> 02:02:48,760
I thought it was already out there.

2523
02:02:48,760 --> 02:02:52,320
Maybe this is some type of box diversion over there as well.

2524
02:02:52,320 --> 02:02:57,120
Um, moving on to the Nintendo 3DS, I think is pretty slow this week.

2525
02:02:57,120 --> 02:03:00,880
Yeah, no, I mean, Nintendo has obviously been focusing on the switch, which I'm not sure

2526
02:03:00,880 --> 02:03:03,360
we have anything to report on the switch this week.

2527
02:03:03,360 --> 02:03:04,360
No, we don't.

2528
02:03:04,360 --> 02:03:06,320
I'm not starting to see switch releases fill in for Japan yet.

2529
02:03:06,320 --> 02:03:08,240
Uh, that's probably going to take a little bit.

2530
02:03:08,240 --> 02:03:12,680
And as we know, the Indies online is kind of what's really going to try to carry a Nintendo

2531
02:03:12,680 --> 02:03:14,520
through these first few months here.

2532
02:03:14,520 --> 02:03:16,680
So that's it for Japanese releases.

2533
02:03:16,680 --> 02:03:19,040
How about the United Kingdom?

2534
02:03:19,040 --> 02:03:20,040
Nothing.

2535
02:03:20,040 --> 02:03:21,040
Nothing.

2536
02:03:21,040 --> 02:03:22,040
Nothing.

2537
02:03:22,040 --> 02:03:25,680
I guess when a new console comes out, that kind of takes the attention for a while.

2538
02:03:25,680 --> 02:03:27,600
Nothing else happens.

2539
02:03:27,600 --> 02:03:29,040
Tumbleweed is rolling by.

2540
02:03:29,040 --> 02:03:31,920
All right, let's go to the mailbag.

2541
02:03:31,920 --> 02:03:37,440
Every week you guys email us at participate at orange lounge radio.com and dark soccer

2542
02:03:37,440 --> 02:03:43,840
dives in the mailbag and finds an email that she thinks, Hey, I'm going to read this on

2543
02:03:43,840 --> 02:03:44,840
air.

2544
02:03:44,840 --> 02:03:45,840
Dark soccer.

2545
02:03:45,840 --> 02:03:46,840
Do we have email this week?

2546
02:03:46,840 --> 02:03:47,840
I think we have one, right?

2547
02:03:47,840 --> 02:03:48,840
We will.

2548
02:03:48,840 --> 02:03:49,840
Yeah.

2549
02:03:49,840 --> 02:03:50,840
One actually came at the end of last week.

2550
02:03:50,840 --> 02:03:51,840
So I'm just going to read it.

2551
02:03:51,840 --> 02:04:00,440
It's from Y Y R it's labeled floater and the body is, this is a crusty poop heart Aaron.

2552
02:04:00,440 --> 02:04:01,640
That's disgusting.

2553
02:04:01,640 --> 02:04:05,160
But I think that's because you said something about throwing poop emails in the mailbag

2554
02:04:05,160 --> 02:04:06,160
or something.

2555
02:04:06,160 --> 02:04:07,160
Maybe I said it.

2556
02:04:07,160 --> 02:04:08,160
I don't know.

2557
02:04:08,160 --> 02:04:09,160
Thanks.

2558
02:04:09,160 --> 02:04:10,160
Gross.

2559
02:04:10,160 --> 02:04:11,160
We got another one from Fabrice from Belgium.

2560
02:04:11,160 --> 02:04:12,160
Just real quick.

2561
02:04:12,160 --> 02:04:13,160
I'm just want to throw this out there.

2562
02:04:13,160 --> 02:04:17,800
If you ever do end up coming up with a pixel shits too, I think the subtitle floater would

2563
02:04:17,800 --> 02:04:18,800
be appropriate.

2564
02:04:18,800 --> 02:04:24,320
It should be pixel shits too, should be turds in a river.

2565
02:04:24,320 --> 02:04:26,440
Next thing you have to sink the floaters.

2566
02:04:26,440 --> 02:04:30,240
All right, that's telling him how to live his life.

2567
02:04:30,240 --> 02:04:31,240
Hello.

2568
02:04:31,240 --> 02:04:37,680
O L R. I wonder what is your go to your to go game when you want to relax a game with

2569
02:04:37,680 --> 02:04:43,080
no stress, something easy going yours truly Fabrice from Belgium.

2570
02:04:43,080 --> 02:04:45,600
Skyrim H D remastered.

2571
02:04:45,600 --> 02:04:46,600
Yeah.

2572
02:04:46,600 --> 02:04:49,480
The Skyrim remastered is your go to answer for everything.

2573
02:04:49,480 --> 02:04:51,140
It's pretty well, it's just relaxing.

2574
02:04:51,140 --> 02:04:57,160
It's what I do the relax cause it's not really that hard.

2575
02:04:57,160 --> 02:05:00,900
For me, it could be the MMO, Final Fantasy 14, although that's not always a relaxing

2576
02:05:00,900 --> 02:05:04,880
thing if I'm trying to do like, you know, content that's, you know, newest and greatest

2577
02:05:04,880 --> 02:05:05,880
it's like farming.

2578
02:05:05,880 --> 02:05:06,880
And wow.

2579
02:05:06,880 --> 02:05:07,880
Yeah.

2580
02:05:07,880 --> 02:05:09,920
Well there's some of the like Zen things you can do.

2581
02:05:09,920 --> 02:05:13,360
You know what's always been a very Zen game to me, like just kind of get in the mood and

2582
02:05:13,360 --> 02:05:18,620
just, you know, do whatever Minecraft is a game like that for me actually digging holes

2583
02:05:18,620 --> 02:05:19,620
with that music.

2584
02:05:19,620 --> 02:05:20,620
Exactly.

2585
02:05:20,620 --> 02:05:21,620
Yeah.

2586
02:05:21,620 --> 02:05:23,520
I actually think I find Minecraft to be a very relaxing game.

2587
02:05:23,520 --> 02:05:30,200
Now granted, I don't play on super hard difficulty, but I don't play on, um, what is it peaceful

2588
02:05:30,200 --> 02:05:31,840
mode or whatever they call the creative.

2589
02:05:31,840 --> 02:05:32,840
Yeah.

2590
02:05:32,840 --> 02:05:33,840
Creative.

2591
02:05:33,840 --> 02:05:34,840
I don't really play in that mode either.

2592
02:05:34,840 --> 02:05:38,000
I do play in the survival, but I play on like the lowest difficulty setting.

2593
02:05:38,080 --> 02:05:42,160
So it's like, there's a creeper once in a while who's going to piss me off, but it's,

2594
02:05:42,160 --> 02:05:43,480
it's manageable.

2595
02:05:43,480 --> 02:05:45,280
So I like Minecraft for game.

2596
02:05:45,280 --> 02:05:49,560
Um, sometimes music games, I mean, it's been a long time since I really been able to just

2597
02:05:49,560 --> 02:05:51,840
pop in, beat me into 2DX and do that.

2598
02:05:51,840 --> 02:05:56,360
But even something like rez right now is kind of like that Zen thing for me.

2599
02:05:56,360 --> 02:05:57,360
Animal crossing.

2600
02:05:57,360 --> 02:05:58,360
Oh, is that your answer?

2601
02:05:58,360 --> 02:05:59,360
Yeah.

2602
02:05:59,360 --> 02:06:03,520
I mean, I kind of, I've kind of slacked off on it cause I need a new game to keep up with,

2603
02:06:04,040 --> 02:06:07,360
but I've really enjoyed, you know, just about every animal crossing is something that's

2604
02:06:07,360 --> 02:06:09,880
really relaxing and hanging out.

2605
02:06:09,880 --> 02:06:11,680
It's just really easy.

2606
02:06:11,680 --> 02:06:16,840
And then of course my reoccurring addiction to bust a move or puzzle bobble.

2607
02:06:16,840 --> 02:06:21,440
You know what else for me is relaxing is watching other people play video games on Twitch, honestly,

2608
02:06:21,440 --> 02:06:26,280
like sometimes I just want to lie on the couch and watch somebody else play a game.

2609
02:06:26,280 --> 02:06:27,280
So I do that too.

2610
02:06:27,280 --> 02:06:29,000
I have Dan for that.

2611
02:06:29,000 --> 02:06:30,000
There you go.

2612
02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:35,080
See, no, actually it's kind of stressful as I'm like, you just missed the thing.

2613
02:06:35,080 --> 02:06:37,920
Go no, go, go backseat driver.

2614
02:06:37,920 --> 02:06:42,320
If you don't fucking crouch and shoot that goat in the head, I'm leaving and he'll be

2615
02:06:42,320 --> 02:06:47,080
like promise.

2616
02:06:47,080 --> 02:06:48,600
This is what gaming is like in my house.

2617
02:06:48,600 --> 02:06:49,600
Yeah, no, no.

2618
02:06:49,600 --> 02:06:53,120
Um, see, Alan does most of his gaming on computer, so I can't exactly just be like, what'd you

2619
02:06:53,120 --> 02:06:54,120
do?

2620
02:06:54,120 --> 02:06:57,620
And I will do that once in a while, but I can't really like watch him play, uh, oblivion,

2621
02:06:57,620 --> 02:07:01,300
which I know is what he's doing right now because he played the shit out of Skyrim.

2622
02:07:01,300 --> 02:07:06,000
Then he played this shit out of Morrowind and obviously what was left is, well, he played

2623
02:07:06,000 --> 02:07:07,000
five and three.

2624
02:07:07,000 --> 02:07:08,080
When's he going to do four?

2625
02:07:08,080 --> 02:07:11,300
So now he's making his way through oblivion right now with mods galore.

2626
02:07:11,300 --> 02:07:16,080
So you know, though I do have an account for elder scrolls online and I probably should

2627
02:07:16,080 --> 02:07:21,140
play it so that, you know, I didn't care for it, but I'm willing to give it another shot.

2628
02:07:21,140 --> 02:07:22,900
It's been a while since I tried it last.

2629
02:07:22,900 --> 02:07:25,300
I keep promising Tiara that I'll play more of it.

2630
02:07:25,300 --> 02:07:26,300
Oh yeah, she's, she's super.

2631
02:07:26,300 --> 02:07:29,100
Someone should be playing well with me.

2632
02:07:29,100 --> 02:07:30,700
Somebody should give me money to do that.

2633
02:07:30,700 --> 02:07:31,700
You know what?

2634
02:07:31,700 --> 02:07:32,700
I'll do it.

2635
02:07:32,700 --> 02:07:33,700
No, don't do it.

2636
02:07:33,700 --> 02:07:34,700
Don't do that.

2637
02:07:34,700 --> 02:07:35,700
I'm threatening it now.

2638
02:07:35,700 --> 02:07:36,700
No, don't.

2639
02:07:36,700 --> 02:07:37,700
That's mean.

2640
02:07:37,700 --> 02:07:43,660
Besides, wait for the mass effect thing to wear off because I'm not going to get a month

2641
02:07:43,660 --> 02:07:45,180
out of it with mass effect on the horizon.

2642
02:07:45,180 --> 02:07:48,780
Wait for that to wear off and then, and then we'll think about that.

2643
02:07:48,780 --> 02:07:49,780
All right.

2644
02:07:49,780 --> 02:07:51,780
Is that it for the mailbag?

2645
02:07:51,780 --> 02:07:52,780
Yeah.

2646
02:07:52,780 --> 02:07:53,780
All right.

2647
02:07:53,780 --> 02:07:56,620
Let's get to some other gaming news and then we're going to get to your calls.

2648
02:07:56,620 --> 02:07:59,020
Orange Lounge Radio on Skype, but first Loki.

2649
02:07:59,020 --> 02:08:02,940
See, this is the kind of thing that makes me wish I could go to GDC because of this

2650
02:08:02,940 --> 02:08:04,060
kind of stuff.

2651
02:08:04,060 --> 02:08:09,500
So Microsoft revealed, um, they're one of their first, remember they were, I think,

2652
02:08:09,500 --> 02:08:14,900
was it said, um, God, I'm trying to remember when they announced the, like their headsets

2653
02:08:14,900 --> 02:08:18,700
that they were coming, but I know it was relatively recent that they announced that they're going

2654
02:08:18,700 --> 02:08:21,980
to be developing some actual VR headsets and stuff.

2655
02:08:21,980 --> 02:08:27,060
Um, but anyways, one of the first ones that they were talking about, of course, um, Acer,

2656
02:08:27,060 --> 02:08:32,780
ASUS and Dell were going to develop mixed reality headsets and they showed off the one

2657
02:08:32,780 --> 02:08:33,780
from Acer.

2658
02:08:33,780 --> 02:08:38,260
And so apparently if you went to this event, you also got one of the free dev kits, which

2659
02:08:38,260 --> 02:08:43,780
I totally would want, um, but then what the Acer windows, uh, mixed reality development

2660
02:08:43,780 --> 02:08:51,260
edition, it has two screens that are 1440 by 1440 and a native 90 Hertz refresh rate

2661
02:08:51,260 --> 02:08:53,900
built in audio and a headphone Jack.

2662
02:08:53,900 --> 02:09:00,860
Plus what's kind of cool is it, uh, doesn't require, um, any, uh, built in tracking.

2663
02:09:00,860 --> 02:09:10,060
So it's going to basically allow developers not have to extern or, or rely on external,

2664
02:09:10,060 --> 02:09:14,700
um, tracking, you know, like they have with like the vibe and stuff like that.

2665
02:09:14,700 --> 02:09:19,500
So it's gonna, I guess it has some way to track built on in the actual headset.

2666
02:09:19,660 --> 02:09:24,020
Um, the little video that they kind of showed demonstrating, it looks neat.

2667
02:09:24,020 --> 02:09:28,020
It's more of like kind of what they were showing with the whole windows holographic, where,

2668
02:09:28,020 --> 02:09:31,300
you know, more of like an office setting, you know, you can have it interact with the

2669
02:09:31,300 --> 02:09:32,300
stuff that's in your room.

2670
02:09:32,300 --> 02:09:39,020
I mean, they have like a picture in this of like Skype and some virtual dog thing.

2671
02:09:39,020 --> 02:09:43,580
And you know, I don't know, outlook or something like that.

2672
02:09:43,580 --> 02:09:48,540
Not too exciting, but I still think I'm pretty excited by like doing that virtual offices

2673
02:09:48,540 --> 02:09:50,060
would be pretty sweet.

2674
02:09:50,060 --> 02:09:54,780
Um, no word when they're actually going to be released, but it's neat to see that stuff

2675
02:09:54,780 --> 02:10:01,220
is coming along and hopefully with that coming along, it won't require such a powerful PC

2676
02:10:01,220 --> 02:10:02,220
to run.

2677
02:10:02,220 --> 02:10:07,100
Uh, the other cool thing, Oculus announced that they're cutting the price of the Oculus

2678
02:10:07,100 --> 02:10:10,420
Rift and touch bundles to $598.

2679
02:10:10,420 --> 02:10:12,340
That is down $200.

2680
02:10:12,340 --> 02:10:18,260
Plus not only that, you can get the controller set, um, for $99 instead of $199.

2681
02:10:18,260 --> 02:10:19,260
Wow.

2682
02:10:19,260 --> 02:10:20,260
They're still allowed to sell them.

2683
02:10:20,260 --> 02:10:21,260
Good point.

2684
02:10:21,260 --> 02:10:25,860
I actually thought about them like they're trying to get rid of those as quickly as possible.

2685
02:10:25,860 --> 02:10:29,180
That was my first thought is like, wow, they're going to try to sandbag this shit before they

2686
02:10:29,180 --> 02:10:30,740
can't sell them anymore.

2687
02:10:30,740 --> 02:10:31,860
It's kind of interesting.

2688
02:10:31,860 --> 02:10:35,740
Although obviously I would hope that doesn't happen, but you know, I mean that lawsuit

2689
02:10:35,740 --> 02:10:38,200
was kind of interesting, fascinating.

2690
02:10:38,200 --> 02:10:41,900
So they're saying though, um, you know, they're talking about also as I mentioned, you know,

2691
02:10:41,900 --> 02:10:45,780
expensive PC, the village nowadays, so with the hardware it's coming out, it's getting

2692
02:10:45,780 --> 02:10:46,780
cheaper and cheaper.

2693
02:10:46,780 --> 02:10:48,540
They own a PC that can actually be VR ready.

2694
02:10:48,540 --> 02:10:49,540
Yeah.

2695
02:10:49,540 --> 02:10:52,700
So they're saying that when the Oculus first came out, you know, PC like that would cost

2696
02:10:52,700 --> 02:10:57,160
about a thousand dollars nowadays though, it's about 700 and they said you can even

2697
02:10:57,160 --> 02:11:00,620
get by with a PC that's built for like 400 at minimum specs.

2698
02:11:00,620 --> 02:11:08,500
So that's not bad, not bad at all, but definitely need to do I get up off my ass and redo what

2699
02:11:08,500 --> 02:11:14,380
I wanted to do here in the studio with a upgrade in OLR because I'm very curious with the new

2700
02:11:14,380 --> 02:11:18,380
AMD Ryzen chips that they had come out to see those are supposed to perform pretty well.

2701
02:11:18,380 --> 02:11:23,880
So I, and they're cheaper than the Microsoft chips or you know, the Intel chips.

2702
02:11:23,880 --> 02:11:27,580
So I don't know, I'm a kind of an Intel fanboy.

2703
02:11:27,580 --> 02:11:33,120
I've got AMD in my laptop and I don't really care for it too much, but the Ryzen chips

2704
02:11:33,120 --> 02:11:34,120
sound good.

2705
02:11:34,120 --> 02:11:39,800
I'm going to our chat over at live.vognetwork.com I'm still fascinated on this whole relaxing

2706
02:11:39,800 --> 02:11:40,800
game talk.

2707
02:11:40,800 --> 02:11:41,800
There's been a lot of talk in there.

2708
02:11:41,800 --> 02:11:43,860
I've just catching up while he was reading that story.

2709
02:11:43,860 --> 02:11:46,060
So back to back on the relaxing thing for a minute.

2710
02:11:46,060 --> 02:11:49,660
Brad from Pod Culture suggesting No Man's Sky is a great Zen game.

2711
02:11:49,660 --> 02:11:51,640
Yeah, that game had a lot in common with Minecraft.

2712
02:11:51,640 --> 02:11:55,900
Like I understand that game is riddled with controversy, but you know, again, we've talked

2713
02:11:55,900 --> 02:11:59,620
about this to death, but for what it is, there's a lot to enjoy about it.

2714
02:11:59,620 --> 02:12:02,740
And yeah, there's definitely a lot of relaxing stuff in No Man's Sky.

2715
02:12:02,740 --> 02:12:06,020
Kossen in chat says Stardew sounds like it could be my Zen game.

2716
02:12:06,020 --> 02:12:07,020
Oh yeah.

2717
02:12:07,020 --> 02:12:09,260
A lot of people are into Stardew Valley for that for sure.

2718
02:12:09,260 --> 02:12:11,800
Dungeon Buster agreeing Stardew is pretty Zen.

2719
02:12:11,800 --> 02:12:14,080
You don't need to rush into stuff and you can just grow things.

2720
02:12:14,080 --> 02:12:15,920
Do they have that out on the Switch already?

2721
02:12:15,920 --> 02:12:16,920
I know that was...

2722
02:12:16,920 --> 02:12:17,920
It's coming.

2723
02:12:17,920 --> 02:12:18,920
It's not out yet.

2724
02:12:18,920 --> 02:12:19,920
It wasn't a launch title.

2725
02:12:19,920 --> 02:12:20,920
Pardon me.

2726
02:12:20,920 --> 02:12:21,920
It wasn't a launch title.

2727
02:12:21,920 --> 02:12:26,360
They were saying that it is going to be the first place you can do multiplayer.

2728
02:12:26,360 --> 02:12:28,180
Stardew Valley will be on the Switch.

2729
02:12:28,180 --> 02:12:30,520
So that's what Nintendo is getting.

2730
02:12:30,520 --> 02:12:31,520
That's a little special.

2731
02:12:31,520 --> 02:12:37,360
Sg100mata is pointing out, I remember at Magfest where they did yoga for gamers, they played

2732
02:12:37,360 --> 02:12:39,520
Minecraft music during it.

2733
02:12:39,520 --> 02:12:45,040
JD saying Mini Metro is a good Zen game.

2734
02:12:45,040 --> 02:12:48,000
William Murderface says Terraria is my chill game.

2735
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:49,000
Gotta mind them 2D pixels.

2736
02:12:49,000 --> 02:12:51,760
Yeah, kind of like a 2D version of Minecraft.

2737
02:12:51,760 --> 02:12:54,880
My relaxing game of course is Until Dawn Rush of Blood.

2738
02:12:54,880 --> 02:12:56,600
It's not relaxing at all.

2739
02:12:56,600 --> 02:12:59,120
It can't be if you played it enough.

2740
02:12:59,120 --> 02:13:04,120
That's like saying I'm going to go play Resident Evil 7 just to chill out and relax a little

2741
02:13:04,120 --> 02:13:05,120
bit.

2742
02:13:05,120 --> 02:13:06,120
That's a nice easy evening.

2743
02:13:06,120 --> 02:13:07,120
Stress free.

2744
02:13:07,720 --> 02:13:13,440
I'm going to play Slenderman just to, you know, chill out.

2745
02:13:13,440 --> 02:13:14,440
I have the hiccups.

2746
02:13:14,440 --> 02:13:15,440
This is the worst.

2747
02:13:15,440 --> 02:13:16,440
All right.

2748
02:13:16,440 --> 02:13:18,080
Let me try to get through this story.

2749
02:13:18,080 --> 02:13:22,120
One of the games that is on the Switch for launch is Shovel Knight.

2750
02:13:22,120 --> 02:13:27,880
I haven't picked this up yet because I already own Shovel Knight on I think PlayStation 4

2751
02:13:27,880 --> 02:13:28,880
and Wii U.

2752
02:13:28,880 --> 02:13:32,800
So I was kind of like, do I really want to buy this game again?

2753
02:13:32,800 --> 02:13:36,000
But this Shovel Knight, they have Specter of Torment separately, right?

2754
02:13:36,000 --> 02:13:37,720
The prequel or whatever it is.

2755
02:13:37,720 --> 02:13:41,720
They have that separate, but this Shovel Knight actually has all the original DLC included

2756
02:13:41,720 --> 02:13:44,780
with it, which is pretty cool.

2757
02:13:44,780 --> 02:13:50,460
And also with Shovel Knight, they are actually allowing you to do gender swapping in this

2758
02:13:50,460 --> 02:13:52,640
new version of Shovel Knight.

2759
02:13:52,640 --> 02:13:54,960
Although they're calling it body swap.

2760
02:13:54,960 --> 02:13:55,960
I should be clear there.

2761
02:13:55,960 --> 02:14:03,240
It's called body swap, but you can actually change the look and the text of Shovel Knight,

2762
02:14:03,240 --> 02:14:08,680
Shield Knight, Black Knight, Plague Knight, and Propeller Knight to be male or female.

2763
02:14:08,680 --> 02:14:14,640
So you could be a male Shovel Knight trying to save a male Shield Knight, or you could

2764
02:14:14,640 --> 02:14:19,120
be like a female Shovel Knight trying to save a male Shield Knight or whatever the hell

2765
02:14:19,120 --> 02:14:21,080
it is that you want to do.

2766
02:14:21,080 --> 02:14:23,640
You can change that in the characters.

2767
02:14:23,640 --> 02:14:27,280
What's cool is there's been a whole little like, kind of like looking into how these

2768
02:14:27,280 --> 02:14:31,820
characters were designed, then you actually get to see a little bit that goes into it

2769
02:14:31,820 --> 02:14:36,620
where it's not just like the female versions have a bow in their hair.

2770
02:14:36,620 --> 02:14:37,620
They're very different.

2771
02:14:37,620 --> 02:14:38,660
And sometimes it's very subtle.

2772
02:14:38,660 --> 02:14:42,660
Like when I look at the female Shovel Knight, I have a really hard time seeing the difference,

2773
02:14:42,660 --> 02:14:45,820
but there is, there is a difference and they kind of, they point out some of the stuff

2774
02:14:45,820 --> 02:14:46,820
there.

2775
02:14:46,820 --> 02:14:51,140
So does female Shovel Knight have more boobs or I mean, yes, but it's not like over the

2776
02:14:51,140 --> 02:14:52,140
top.

2777
02:14:52,140 --> 02:14:57,340
I mean, yes, women have breasts, so there is a breast area, but it's not like dead or

2778
02:14:57,340 --> 02:14:58,840
alive breasts.

2779
02:14:58,840 --> 02:15:00,840
You know what I mean?

2780
02:15:00,840 --> 02:15:01,840
Yes.

2781
02:15:01,840 --> 02:15:02,840
I get it.

2782
02:15:02,840 --> 02:15:07,960
It's what you would expect a normal woman to look like in a, but in a, in a Knight outfit.

2783
02:15:07,960 --> 02:15:12,840
Nobody ever said dead or alive was set on earth, so.

2784
02:15:12,840 --> 02:15:17,160
And sometimes the fun way to play it is with gravity from the moon, right?

2785
02:15:17,160 --> 02:15:23,120
It's just gravity from the moon, only in the chest area that that's really everywhere else.

2786
02:15:23,120 --> 02:15:25,920
You know, it's, it's its own thing.

2787
02:15:26,000 --> 02:15:31,160
Uh, let's see, SSU 100 Matt says, it's funny that Shane all of a sudden is going crazy

2788
02:15:31,160 --> 02:15:32,160
over Shovel Knight.

2789
02:15:32,160 --> 02:15:35,680
Now he's not here to defend himself, although I've told him he can come on the show whenever

2790
02:15:35,680 --> 02:15:37,800
he wants.

2791
02:15:37,800 --> 02:15:42,720
But yes, I think it's funny too, cause I tried to like play that game before for him, but

2792
02:15:42,720 --> 02:15:46,280
now that it's on the Switch, Shane is all about the Switch.

2793
02:15:46,280 --> 02:15:49,800
I almost wish he was here tonight to kind of be a nice little counterbalance to maybe

2794
02:15:49,800 --> 02:15:53,600
some of the negativity cause Shane is like nothing but positive on Switch right now.

2795
02:15:53,600 --> 02:15:59,200
So maybe I'll get him here on a future week, but now that Shovel Knight's on the Switch,

2796
02:15:59,200 --> 02:16:00,200
he's checking that out.

2797
02:16:00,200 --> 02:16:02,200
So interesting.

2798
02:16:02,200 --> 02:16:09,800
All right, moving on, let's get to another story from Dark Sakura.

2799
02:16:09,800 --> 02:16:13,640
There is some smart garbage out there.

2800
02:16:13,640 --> 02:16:19,640
It's actually a trash can that has a game built into it.

2801
02:16:19,640 --> 02:16:27,800
So it's called the Tetra bin and it basically rewards you for throwing away garbage by having

2802
02:16:27,800 --> 02:16:30,420
a little game built into it.

2803
02:16:30,420 --> 02:16:36,120
I couldn't see too much about it, but like pretty much the way that it works, it looks

2804
02:16:36,120 --> 02:16:38,820
almost like it's got a duck hunt screen on it.

2805
02:16:38,820 --> 02:16:46,120
And when you drop your can in, there is a, like a, birds will like go and try to catch

2806
02:16:46,120 --> 02:16:49,200
the garbage on the digitized screen.

2807
02:16:49,200 --> 02:16:53,480
And they, and there's like dogs and bats and oh yeah, they're bats, not birds.

2808
02:16:53,480 --> 02:16:55,360
They fly around going, feed me, feed me.

2809
02:16:55,360 --> 02:17:00,960
And so when you feed them, you get a code that can be redeemed on the Tetra bin website

2810
02:17:00,960 --> 02:17:07,120
so that, um, you can get like stuff in the mail, like freebies and samples and things

2811
02:17:07,120 --> 02:17:08,120
like that.

2812
02:17:08,120 --> 02:17:11,720
So the cycle never ends.

2813
02:17:11,720 --> 02:17:16,580
But the whole thing is it's meant to encourage other people to get into the habit of picking

2814
02:17:16,580 --> 02:17:19,420
up trash that you see around and throw away.

2815
02:17:19,420 --> 02:17:22,860
So which everyone should fucking be doing, actually, everyone should just be throwing

2816
02:17:22,860 --> 02:17:24,700
away their own garbage.

2817
02:17:24,700 --> 02:17:25,700
Don't leave your shit.

2818
02:17:25,700 --> 02:17:26,700
Throw it away.

2819
02:17:26,700 --> 02:17:27,700
There's a trash can.

2820
02:17:27,700 --> 02:17:29,780
And don't leave your dog shit either.

2821
02:17:29,780 --> 02:17:31,480
Yes, that too.

2822
02:17:31,480 --> 02:17:36,020
If you don't have a trash can handy, put it in a bag or something and then wait until

2823
02:17:36,020 --> 02:17:37,020
you can throw it away.

2824
02:17:37,020 --> 02:17:41,220
It's not that fucking hard, but anyway, it's, it's a good incentive and I think it's a cute

2825
02:17:41,220 --> 02:17:42,220
idea.

2826
02:17:42,220 --> 02:17:45,780
So, but the real question is, can you install Linux on it?

2827
02:17:45,780 --> 02:17:46,780
Probably.

2828
02:17:46,780 --> 02:17:47,780
I bet it's running on Linux.

2829
02:17:47,780 --> 02:17:48,780
Yeah.

2830
02:17:48,780 --> 02:17:49,780
I was gonna say it's probably running Linux.

2831
02:17:49,780 --> 02:17:50,780
That's true.

2832
02:17:50,780 --> 02:17:51,780
It probably is.

2833
02:17:51,780 --> 02:17:52,780
That's it on that.

2834
02:17:52,780 --> 02:17:53,780
All right.

2835
02:17:53,780 --> 02:17:54,780
Just a couple more stories for you guys.

2836
02:17:54,780 --> 02:17:58,020
And then the Skypline at Orange Lounge Radio.

2837
02:17:58,020 --> 02:18:05,020
So Riot Games has won a lawsuit against a website called LeagueSharp and LeagueSharp

2838
02:18:05,020 --> 02:18:12,640
was a website running, um, it allowed you to sign up for $15 to $50 a month for access

2839
02:18:12,640 --> 02:18:17,760
to numerous bot scripts that would allow players to perform maneuvers that they would,

2840
02:18:17,760 --> 02:18:22,080
you know, be very difficult for them to do otherwise in League of Legends.

2841
02:18:22,080 --> 02:18:25,600
And so of course, you know, they went after them because that's, you know, a big no-no

2842
02:18:25,600 --> 02:18:31,440
and, um, they won $10 million.

2843
02:18:31,440 --> 02:18:34,560
$10 million?

2844
02:18:34,560 --> 02:18:35,560
That's a lot of money.

2845
02:18:35,560 --> 02:18:36,560
Yep.

2846
02:18:36,560 --> 02:18:37,560
Wow.

2847
02:18:37,560 --> 02:18:44,400
Being that they won the, uh, you know, websites no more.

2848
02:18:44,400 --> 02:18:47,400
But that software is still out there for people to use, right?

2849
02:18:47,400 --> 02:18:49,120
I'm just kidding.

2850
02:18:49,120 --> 02:18:51,120
Once on the internet, always on the internet.

2851
02:18:51,120 --> 02:18:53,080
All right.

2852
02:18:53,080 --> 02:18:55,520
Um, so, uh, yeah.

2853
02:18:55,520 --> 02:19:00,720
Don't, don't write cheat programs for games that rely on these things to make money, right?

2854
02:19:00,720 --> 02:19:02,560
Or you might find yourself in court too.

2855
02:19:02,560 --> 02:19:03,560
Don't cheat in online games.

2856
02:19:03,560 --> 02:19:04,560
There you go.

2857
02:19:04,560 --> 02:19:05,560
That's a very good way of putting it.

2858
02:19:05,560 --> 02:19:06,560
Don't cheat in online games.

2859
02:19:06,560 --> 02:19:07,560
That's very good.

2860
02:19:07,560 --> 02:19:08,560
All right.

2861
02:19:08,560 --> 02:19:09,840
I'm going to try to get through this.

2862
02:19:09,840 --> 02:19:13,880
I have hiccups though, and this is the worst possible thing that could happen on the radio

2863
02:19:13,880 --> 02:19:14,880
in my opinion.

2864
02:19:14,880 --> 02:19:17,040
But, um, anyway, I'm trying, trying to get through this.

2865
02:19:17,040 --> 02:19:22,040
Um, the, uh, this week launched the Video Game History Foundation.

2866
02:19:22,040 --> 02:19:23,960
Um, this is pretty cool.

2867
02:19:23,960 --> 02:19:28,880
Uh, being launched by a former games journalist and developer, uh, Frank Sifaldi, uh, who

2868
02:19:28,880 --> 02:19:33,360
was involved with the, um, you know, what's funny is that was on a podcast he was on,

2869
02:19:33,360 --> 02:19:34,880
but we were on at different times.

2870
02:19:34,880 --> 02:19:38,520
And, uh, so we weren't like on there together, but like, I know they were promoting that

2871
02:19:38,520 --> 02:19:41,760
he was coming up next after me, um, or the other way around.

2872
02:19:41,760 --> 02:19:45,680
But anyway, he, he was involved with the, um, Mega Man collection.

2873
02:19:45,680 --> 02:19:49,120
So I know he does a lot with the retro video games and, uh, I want to say, didn't he drop

2874
02:19:49,120 --> 02:19:52,400
hints that there might be something else coming with that whole Mega Man thing?

2875
02:19:52,400 --> 02:19:55,040
Well, uh, anyway, he does a lot with video game restoration.

2876
02:19:55,040 --> 02:20:03,660
I think the, also the story that was going around about the joust game that Iwata had

2877
02:20:03,660 --> 02:20:05,780
been involved with on the NES.

2878
02:20:05,780 --> 02:20:06,780
We talked about a few months ago.

2879
02:20:06,780 --> 02:20:09,340
I think he was involved with that as well.

2880
02:20:09,340 --> 02:20:13,220
So it seems like when there is a digging up something in video games past thing going

2881
02:20:13,220 --> 02:20:15,680
on, this guy does seem to be involved.

2882
02:20:15,680 --> 02:20:20,700
So yeah, this is a guy that seems to be a good fit for this, working with this Video

2883
02:20:20,700 --> 02:20:21,780
Game History Foundation.

2884
02:20:21,780 --> 02:20:28,020
It's a nonprofit organization dedicated to preserving the past of video games, not just

2885
02:20:28,020 --> 02:20:35,700
code, but the printed materials, advertisements, and other things that go into video games.

2886
02:20:35,700 --> 02:20:38,260
So the first project launched this week.

2887
02:20:38,260 --> 02:20:45,780
It's a digital archive of pamphlets and ads surrounding the NES's original launch in 1985.

2888
02:20:45,780 --> 02:20:50,500
So they are on Patreon if you want to support them there, or you can check out their website,

2889
02:20:50,500 --> 02:20:55,780
gamehistory.org, and you can actually do a tax deductible donation over there.

2890
02:20:55,780 --> 02:21:00,940
You know, this is something they are saying is important because, especially when it comes

2891
02:21:00,940 --> 02:21:04,740
to CD-ROMs, which was a huge era of gaming, right?

2892
02:21:04,740 --> 02:21:08,780
Our classic game of the week, part of that CD-ROM era of gaming, right?

2893
02:21:08,780 --> 02:21:10,900
CD-ROMs don't last forever.

2894
02:21:10,900 --> 02:21:15,900
And some of the CD-ROMs out there are really starting to break down, so they want to preserve

2895
02:21:15,900 --> 02:21:21,020
as much as possible of this so that future generations kind of know what the history

2896
02:21:21,020 --> 02:21:22,920
of video gaming looked like.

2897
02:21:22,920 --> 02:21:26,720
You know, unrelated to this, but maybe related a little bit, I was reading a story this week

2898
02:21:26,720 --> 02:21:34,040
about, I guess, like the old CRT televisions that go in old video game cabinets.

2899
02:21:34,040 --> 02:21:35,680
Like they don't make them anymore.

2900
02:21:35,680 --> 02:21:40,360
Like as of this past couple weeks, they don't make CRT TVs anymore.

2901
02:21:40,360 --> 02:21:41,360
They're done.

2902
02:21:41,360 --> 02:21:47,800
So if you want to replace like a TV in a video game cabinet and you can't get one to recycle,

2903
02:21:47,800 --> 02:21:51,960
you have to get like an LCD monitor, which isn't a pure way to do it.

2904
02:21:51,960 --> 02:21:57,400
You know, it's going to be different on an LCD screen versus the old CRTs.

2905
02:21:57,400 --> 02:22:01,600
So that is an era of gaming that's going away too.

2906
02:22:01,600 --> 02:22:04,200
Wasn't the process of making those actually kind of dangerous, and that's part of the

2907
02:22:04,200 --> 02:22:05,640
reason why they don't do it that way anymore?

2908
02:22:05,640 --> 02:22:09,560
Like there's like gas inside the tubes that make it run and all that stuff, right?

2909
02:22:09,560 --> 02:22:11,280
So I think that's a part of the reason why they don't do that.

2910
02:22:11,280 --> 02:22:15,120
Well, they were in a vacuum and if, you know, they had like really high capacitors in them

2911
02:22:15,120 --> 02:22:19,680
and stuff that you got to be careful to, you know, discharge that stuff before you start

2912
02:22:19,680 --> 02:22:26,600
working on them as you don't electrocute yourself, I mean, yeah, it's less than ideal,

2913
02:22:26,600 --> 02:22:31,160
but you know, it's still good, you know, good tech if you're into like, you know, fighting

2914
02:22:31,160 --> 02:22:33,320
games and stuff like that.

2915
02:22:33,320 --> 02:22:37,160
Dungeon Buster in chat says older magazines are also getting harder to come by, which

2916
02:22:37,160 --> 02:22:42,360
is why it's nice that places such as archive.org have a lot of these scanned copies there.

2917
02:22:42,360 --> 02:22:43,600
Yeah, that's very true.

2918
02:22:43,600 --> 02:22:44,600
All right.

2919
02:22:44,600 --> 02:22:47,640
Well, we're going to open up the Skype line right now.

2920
02:22:47,640 --> 02:22:50,480
It's time for you to give us a call if you want to talk about anything we've talked about

2921
02:22:50,480 --> 02:22:54,240
in this part of the show, or maybe the first part of the show, or whatever is on your mind

2922
02:22:54,240 --> 02:22:55,240
tonight.

2923
02:22:55,240 --> 02:22:59,320
Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype if you want to give us a call, and it's already

2924
02:22:59,320 --> 02:23:00,760
lighting up over there.

2925
02:23:00,760 --> 02:23:01,760
Let's get to it.

2926
02:23:01,760 --> 02:23:02,760
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

2927
02:23:02,760 --> 02:23:03,760
Who's this?

2928
02:23:03,760 --> 02:23:04,760
Hey, this is Akdeft.

2929
02:23:04,760 --> 02:23:05,760
Hey, Akdeft.

2930
02:23:05,760 --> 02:23:07,760
How are you, my friend?

2931
02:23:07,760 --> 02:23:10,760
I'm doing okay, mostly.

2932
02:23:10,760 --> 02:23:15,480
Yeah, I know you were one of those people that got screwed by Amazon, huh?

2933
02:23:15,520 --> 02:23:22,840
Yeah, one of the many, but I want to focus on something really great that we talked on

2934
02:23:22,840 --> 02:23:24,600
Twitter the other day.

2935
02:23:24,600 --> 02:23:26,040
Sure, go for it.

2936
02:23:26,040 --> 02:23:34,720
Yeah, we were talking about, well, Breath of the Wild, that's an American dub.

2937
02:23:34,720 --> 02:23:41,920
And while it's not something new that games have recently done, at least in the past few

2938
02:23:41,920 --> 02:23:49,200
years it has grown, I'm still really happy to see that Nintendo has adopted this onto

2939
02:23:49,200 --> 02:23:52,600
their games.

2940
02:23:52,600 --> 02:23:59,080
And I was not hearing about only Breath of the Wild, also Want to Switch also has Latin

2941
02:23:59,080 --> 02:24:00,600
American dubs.

2942
02:24:00,600 --> 02:24:09,280
So it's really awesome to see that game companies, even right now Sony and Microsoft, back in

2943
02:24:09,280 --> 02:24:15,240
the 360 days, it's something that they have done.

2944
02:24:15,240 --> 02:24:25,880
And as a person that, well, speaks English and also Spanish in the native way, it's really

2945
02:24:25,880 --> 02:24:35,680
good to see that they're adopting this to sell their games on other countries.

2946
02:24:36,680 --> 02:24:45,000
Yeah, the back and forth that we were having on Twitter was that you had posted a clip

2947
02:24:45,000 --> 02:24:50,920
of your Overwatch play of the game, and I noticed that it was using, obviously, the

2948
02:24:50,920 --> 02:24:54,000
Latin American language.

2949
02:24:54,000 --> 02:25:00,440
And I thought it was neat because it kind of emulates that robotic voice that goes,

2950
02:25:00,440 --> 02:25:01,720
play of the game.

2951
02:25:01,720 --> 02:25:04,320
It says it in Spanish instead.

2952
02:25:04,360 --> 02:25:06,960
And then it kind of got me thinking about how, oh yeah, you have all these other voice

2953
02:25:06,960 --> 02:25:11,160
actors who kind of emulate the whole like McCree going, it's high noon, you know, probably

2954
02:25:11,160 --> 02:25:15,280
saying it in a very similar way, but in the Latin American dialogue, this is kind of interesting

2955
02:25:15,280 --> 02:25:17,200
to me to listen to that sometimes.

2956
02:25:17,200 --> 02:25:22,880
And I watched the Twitch screens, the streams on Twitch, where they have like Japanese voice

2957
02:25:22,880 --> 02:25:26,120
acting and all that stuff as well, which I think is neat.

2958
02:25:26,920 --> 02:25:36,600
Yeah, also Blizzard did the, well, sorry, did the Overwatch dub for Latin America, and

2959
02:25:36,600 --> 02:25:42,880
many other countries, it has so many dubs in many languages that it's pretty amazing

2960
02:25:42,880 --> 02:25:45,880
to see.

2961
02:25:45,880 --> 02:25:52,400
And something curious, because at least in PC, you can have like the English text and

2962
02:25:52,400 --> 02:26:02,480
have another language be the voice, like have it in Japanese or have it in Spanish.

2963
02:26:02,480 --> 02:26:09,600
And again, it's really great to see something like this and, sorry, I'm going to repeat

2964
02:26:09,600 --> 02:26:16,720
myself again, but it's really amazing to see because it's something that, even in the PlayStation

2965
02:26:16,720 --> 02:26:24,800
2 era, like in that generation, we did see games in Spanish, but many developers were

2966
02:26:24,800 --> 02:26:32,920
like really, really lazy and used Spaniard, the Spanish that is used in Spain, which it

2967
02:26:32,920 --> 02:26:42,640
ain't that much different from Latin America, but it does sound different and we don't use

2968
02:26:42,640 --> 02:26:48,680
in Latin America the same language they use in, or at least the same words.

2969
02:26:48,680 --> 02:26:53,440
There's a whole like, there's a whole verb conjugation that you don't use in Latin America

2970
02:26:53,440 --> 02:26:55,080
that they do in Spanish, right?

2971
02:26:55,080 --> 02:26:56,080
Vosotros?

2972
02:26:56,080 --> 02:26:58,680
That doesn't even exist really in Latin America, right?

2973
02:26:58,680 --> 02:27:07,040
Yeah, in Spain, sorry, they use vosotros, which is basically like you and plural.

2974
02:27:07,040 --> 02:27:14,560
What we use in Latin America, what is status, that is you plural for us, so yeah, it's not

2975
02:27:14,560 --> 02:27:21,080
even the same and it's another verb conjugation and again, it is said that we don't understand

2976
02:27:21,080 --> 02:27:28,960
it because it's like something that was teach even, not even like 30 years ago, so maybe

2977
02:27:28,960 --> 02:27:34,660
some people do know about it, but still, it sounds weird, so well, again, it's something

2978
02:27:34,660 --> 02:27:42,900
like really, really lazy because they didn't even give a chance for a Latin American dub

2979
02:27:42,900 --> 02:27:47,380
or even a translation or adaptation to be done.

2980
02:27:47,380 --> 02:27:53,100
JD's asking in chat, I'm curious about Latin American localizations, do they pick a country's

2981
02:27:53,100 --> 02:28:00,580
dialect to standardize on since there's some variation between Caribbean, Central American,

2982
02:28:00,580 --> 02:28:04,620
but wouldn't that be, I mean, technically you could say even within North America, the

2983
02:28:04,620 --> 02:28:10,500
USA, somebody in California is going to sound somebody different from somebody in Alabama,

2984
02:28:10,500 --> 02:28:11,500
right?

2985
02:28:11,500 --> 02:28:16,700
Dark Sakura, sometimes her Alabama sidekicks in, right, versus in the Northeast where somebody

2986
02:28:16,700 --> 02:28:21,920
might say Wicked Awesome, which is like not something you hear here ever, so, you know,

2987
02:28:21,920 --> 02:28:23,980
like there's little things like that, right?

2988
02:28:23,980 --> 02:28:30,240
I mean, yeah, yeah, but there's definitely things like that and sorry for the interruption,

2989
02:28:30,240 --> 02:28:39,080
but yeah, we in Mexico, we have even like so many dialects, so many accents also, but

2990
02:28:39,080 --> 02:28:45,680
speaking like of Latin America as a whole, pretty much each region, Mexico, Central America,

2991
02:28:45,680 --> 02:28:52,120
South America have distinct accents, so it's not necessarily the same and not even the

2992
02:28:52,120 --> 02:29:01,840
same use of words, but most, at least as of recent, most companies, speaking of movies,

2993
02:29:01,840 --> 02:29:11,040
television, and all that, and now games, try to use like a neutral standard, neutral Spanish,

2994
02:29:11,040 --> 02:29:20,760
so it doesn't use like words that we maybe use in Mexico that aren't used in other countries.

2995
02:29:20,760 --> 02:29:25,560
Like hella, we say hella in Northern California, but nobody else says that, so we wouldn't

2996
02:29:25,560 --> 02:29:28,160
put hella in a video game.

2997
02:29:28,160 --> 02:29:36,000
Yeah, and that's like your character is from California and you're gonna try to emphasize

2998
02:29:36,000 --> 02:29:43,000
that, but other than that, like for example, and I'm gonna put the example of McCree, since

2999
02:29:43,240 --> 02:29:54,240
he's a cowboy, he does have like a typical Northern Mexican accent, somewhat, so at least

3000
02:29:54,760 --> 02:30:01,760
he doesn't use that many words, like specialized words, or, I lost the word specifically for

3001
02:30:05,360 --> 02:30:12,360
it, but, like idioms, or, sorry, but yeah, you get the idea.

3002
02:30:14,000 --> 02:30:21,000
But yeah, there's the voice actor for Lucio in Latin America, he does like this fake Brazilian

3003
02:30:24,560 --> 02:30:31,560
accent too, so yeah, it sounds funny also, and it's really great to see stuff like this

3004
02:30:34,800 --> 02:30:41,800
and to talk about this, because it's something that I really appreciate as a translator myself.

3005
02:30:42,200 --> 02:30:46,280
No, I think it's really fascinating, I think it's cool, I like to just listen to the games

3006
02:30:46,280 --> 02:30:52,320
in the other languages and hear those small nuances and things like that, and yeah, I

3007
02:30:52,320 --> 02:30:57,960
think it's great that it makes the game more accessible to other players, which I think

3008
02:30:57,960 --> 02:30:59,320
is a great thing, of course.

3009
02:30:59,320 --> 02:31:01,480
Oops, excuse me, still have those hiccups.

3010
02:31:01,480 --> 02:31:07,260
But the problem is, or not the problem, but the interesting thing with Zelda is that there's

3011
02:31:07,260 --> 02:31:12,340
not a lot of dialogue that they're going to have to localize either, well, the written

3012
02:31:12,340 --> 02:31:17,900
dialogue, yes, but the voice acting isn't everywhere, I mean, it's still weird to hear

3013
02:31:17,900 --> 02:31:24,560
voice acting in a Zelda game at all, but they still use the general, like, uh, uh, like,

3014
02:31:24,560 --> 02:31:28,820
in some places, like those little noises, they use that a lot.

3015
02:31:28,820 --> 02:31:33,040
But there is definitely some scenes that are voice acted, and yeah, it's kind of interesting

3016
02:31:33,040 --> 02:31:37,220
to hear in the Zelda series, but now our friends in Latin America will get to hear it in the

3017
02:31:37,220 --> 02:31:38,620
in their native language.

3018
02:31:38,620 --> 02:31:47,700
Yeah, and hopefully Nintendo doesn't cut this trend, like, oh, it's only for this few games.

3019
02:31:47,700 --> 02:31:54,220
I hope to see this become a trend, like, probably with Xenoblade, it would be, like, really

3020
02:31:54,220 --> 02:32:01,120
awesome to see, with Xenoblade 2 coming this year, to see, like, a Latin American dub.

3021
02:32:01,120 --> 02:32:07,440
So hopefully, but we'll see, at least, uh, we're taking, the game companies in general

3022
02:32:07,440 --> 02:32:13,320
are taking steps toward, uh, localizing stuff, like, for region, not especially specifically

3023
02:32:13,320 --> 02:32:16,800
for language, so that's really, really great.

3024
02:32:16,800 --> 02:32:17,800
Baby steps.

3025
02:32:17,800 --> 02:32:18,800
Yeah.

3026
02:32:18,800 --> 02:32:19,800
Alright.

3027
02:32:19,800 --> 02:32:23,520
Act F, I'm gonna let you go, but thanks so much for the phone call, my friend.

3028
02:32:23,520 --> 02:32:24,960
Hey, thanks for having me.

3029
02:32:24,960 --> 02:32:27,600
Thank you, bye-bye.

3030
02:32:27,600 --> 02:32:31,680
Orange Lounge Radio on Skype, if you want to give us a call and, uh, talk to me while

3031
02:32:31,680 --> 02:32:33,080
I have the hiccups here.

3032
02:32:33,080 --> 02:32:35,440
Let me check in with Loki to see if there's any last minute stories.

3033
02:32:35,440 --> 02:32:39,880
Sure, yeah, we can talk about a few things, so how about the games that are coming out

3034
02:32:39,880 --> 02:32:41,440
for PlayStation Plus in March?

3035
02:32:41,440 --> 02:32:42,800
So you're gonna get Tearaway-

3036
02:32:42,800 --> 02:32:45,720
I think Dark Soccer covered those during Rapid Fire.

3037
02:32:45,720 --> 02:32:47,800
My mistake, wasn't paying attention.

3038
02:32:47,800 --> 02:32:55,440
Alright, and then how about, uh, we talk about, uh, the campaign here, so the GoFundMe campaign

3039
02:32:55,440 --> 02:33:02,480
for a new Nick Arcade show, um, starring, uh, Phil Moore is gonna be launching, and

3040
02:33:02,480 --> 02:33:08,600
that's for, uh, Battle Arcade, and it's supposed to be kind of the same type of premise, um,

3041
02:33:08,600 --> 02:33:09,600
that's awesome.

3042
02:33:09,600 --> 02:33:17,080
I'm down with that, especially with that reboot of, uh, Starrcade coming back as well, so.

3043
02:33:17,080 --> 02:33:18,080
And-

3044
02:33:18,080 --> 02:33:19,080
Everything old is new again.

3045
02:33:19,080 --> 02:33:20,080
Yeah.

3046
02:33:20,080 --> 02:33:24,200
And then the other thing, um, you know, just kind of a PSA, I guess, um, don't put adhesives

3047
02:33:24,200 --> 02:33:29,160
on your Switch console, because I guess it takes off the paint, because of whatever paint

3048
02:33:29,160 --> 02:33:34,280
or coating they put on it, it's not as durable as some of the other systems out there.

3049
02:33:34,280 --> 02:33:37,360
Be careful with that stuff when it's not officially licensed, for sure.

3050
02:33:37,360 --> 02:33:41,360
Well, even, yeah, I mean, dbrand is the one that kind of pointed that out, because they're

3051
02:33:41,360 --> 02:33:46,920
developing skins for that console, and they're like, hey, you know, we've, you know, got

3052
02:33:46,920 --> 02:33:51,260
the retail version, and we found that it's been pulling paint up, so we're canceling

3053
02:33:51,260 --> 02:33:54,160
all your orders for that stuff, you know, just to let you know, don't do that.

3054
02:33:55,120 --> 02:33:57,120
Which is kind of nice of them.

3055
02:33:57,120 --> 02:33:58,640
Please do not do that.

3056
02:33:58,640 --> 02:33:59,640
Alright.

3057
02:33:59,640 --> 02:34:03,780
Well, um, our phone's not really ringing, so I think I'm going to go ahead and shut

3058
02:34:03,780 --> 02:34:05,320
it down and wrap up the show tonight.

3059
02:34:05,320 --> 02:34:08,120
My hiccups are going crazy, so I think it's time to, uh-

3060
02:34:08,120 --> 02:34:09,240
We didn't do a fuse.

3061
02:34:09,240 --> 02:34:10,800
I think it's time to shut that down.

3062
02:34:10,800 --> 02:34:12,360
You need to do some FUs tonight, Darzagra?

3063
02:34:12,360 --> 02:34:13,360
Yeah.

3064
02:34:13,360 --> 02:34:14,880
Alright, let's get to it then, before we say goodnight.

3065
02:34:14,880 --> 02:34:16,360
The FUs of the week!

3066
02:34:16,360 --> 02:34:38,760
FU to Sinus Infections, and FU to dealing with Kaiser over all of this shit.

3067
02:34:38,760 --> 02:34:40,480
I'm ready to be done.

3068
02:34:40,480 --> 02:34:41,680
Fuck it.

3069
02:34:41,680 --> 02:34:45,560
Also, FU to not being able to finish an entire cool damn fight.

3070
02:34:45,560 --> 02:34:50,000
FU to the hiccups.

3071
02:34:50,000 --> 02:34:53,760
What did I do to deserve this, other than maybe drinking water a little fast?

3072
02:34:53,760 --> 02:34:56,520
Because I was trying to get to the next story.

3073
02:34:56,520 --> 02:35:00,360
Man, Loki, do you have anything to get off your chest tonight?

3074
02:35:00,360 --> 02:35:05,280
I just wish I hadn't eaten 11 breadsticks, other than that, I'm fine.

3075
02:35:05,280 --> 02:35:07,160
Look at this, FU to 11 breadsticks.

3076
02:35:07,160 --> 02:35:08,800
Maybe like 6 breadsticks next time.

3077
02:35:08,800 --> 02:35:13,400
I always say 6 breadsticks, but then I'm like, I'm so hungry, and I mean, I was hungry

3078
02:35:13,400 --> 02:35:16,200
not to eat 11, so, you know, 6 might not have been enough.

3079
02:35:16,200 --> 02:35:17,720
Pretty hungry, it's pretty hungry.

3080
02:35:17,720 --> 02:35:20,920
Alright, that is going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

3081
02:35:20,920 --> 02:35:23,720
Thank you guys so much for tuning into our show tonight.

3082
02:35:23,720 --> 02:35:26,360
If you like what you heard here at Orange Lounge Radio, please tell a friend or five

3083
02:35:26,360 --> 02:35:27,360
about the show.

3084
02:35:27,360 --> 02:35:31,520
Help us spread the word, we don't have any big magazine behind us or anything like that.

3085
02:35:31,520 --> 02:35:34,720
Word of mouth is all we got, so we can be the show where every gamer has a voice, but

3086
02:35:34,720 --> 02:35:37,920
only if the voices are here to air on air.

3087
02:35:37,920 --> 02:35:41,760
A nice five star review on a place like iTunes goes a long way as well.

3088
02:35:41,760 --> 02:35:45,280
If you have not yet written a review for the show on iTunes, please consider doing

3089
02:35:45,280 --> 02:35:46,280
that.

3090
02:35:46,280 --> 02:35:47,640
I really, really, really appreciate that.

3091
02:35:47,640 --> 02:35:52,360
Again, not asking you to donate money or anything like that, just take 15 seconds to write a

3092
02:35:52,360 --> 02:35:53,360
review.

3093
02:35:53,360 --> 02:35:54,480
It would be awesome.

3094
02:35:54,480 --> 02:35:56,560
Really appreciate that.

3095
02:35:56,560 --> 02:35:57,560
That's going to do it.

3096
02:35:57,560 --> 02:36:02,520
Let's go around and get everybody's final thought for the night, Dark Sakura.

3097
02:36:02,520 --> 02:36:08,540
I really am enjoying the new Jessica Jones comic, which really goes into the regular

3098
02:36:08,540 --> 02:36:11,040
Marvel universe and not the TV series.

3099
02:36:11,040 --> 02:36:12,220
Only worth a read.

3100
02:36:12,220 --> 02:36:14,640
Also resist.

3101
02:36:14,640 --> 02:36:18,040
My final thought is, I'm sorry, I'm not going to be doing streaming after the show tonight,

3102
02:36:18,040 --> 02:36:21,640
even though I wanted to start making that a regular thing after last week went very

3103
02:36:21,640 --> 02:36:22,640
well.

3104
02:36:22,640 --> 02:36:27,040
Thank you guys for checking that out at Twitch TV slash Rob Roberts, cheap plug.

3105
02:36:27,040 --> 02:36:32,200
But I'm actually going to get a new monitor for my studio so I can fix some problems that

3106
02:36:32,200 --> 02:36:34,080
I'm having with the ratio.

3107
02:36:34,080 --> 02:36:38,880
And I haven't had a chance to test the switch broadcasting yet, so I'm not ready to do that

3108
02:36:38,880 --> 02:36:39,880
yet tonight.

3109
02:36:39,880 --> 02:36:44,760
I'm hoping that I can do maybe some Blaster Master next week or whatever game I decide

3110
02:36:44,760 --> 02:36:45,760
I want to do.

3111
02:36:45,760 --> 02:36:48,480
But yeah, so I'm not going to be doing that for the show tonight, which is fine anyway

3112
02:36:48,480 --> 02:36:54,340
because my hiccups are, yeah, I need to go lie down and breathe into a paper bag or something.

3113
02:36:54,340 --> 02:36:57,820
So anyway, last but not least, Loki, your final thought.

3114
02:36:57,820 --> 02:37:02,400
My final thought is, I'm tired.

3115
02:37:02,400 --> 02:37:04,320
That's it.

3116
02:37:04,320 --> 02:37:08,000
Alright, right, that's going to do it for another episode of Orange Launch Radio.

3117
02:37:08,120 --> 02:37:10,120
Thank you guys so much for tuning in tonight.

3118
02:37:10,120 --> 02:37:13,480
We will see you in seven days to do it all over again.

3119
02:37:13,480 --> 02:37:16,820
Until then, don't be a jerk to people online.

3120
02:37:16,820 --> 02:37:17,820
Don't give people the hiccups.

3121
02:37:17,820 --> 02:37:18,820
And have a good night.

3122
02:37:18,820 --> 02:37:19,320
Bye.

3123
02:37:38,000 --> 02:37:42,200
The hiccups in this program do not necessarily reflect those of the staff of Orange Launch

3124
02:37:42,200 --> 02:37:47,000
Radio or VOG Network, but you know they were all still true.

3125
02:37:50,000 --> 02:37:51,000
See you next week.

3126
02:38:08,000 --> 02:38:10,000
See you next time.
