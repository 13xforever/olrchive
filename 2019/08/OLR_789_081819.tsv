7000	14000	With your hosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
14000	22000	This week, your favorite modelable, buildable, adventureable, open-world pixel sandbox, Minecraft will not receive 4K texture love, nor is there lipstick to put on its pigs.
22000	28000	This is just one graphic story, stay tuned for the rest of the week's gaming news, starting right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.
28000	32000	Orange Lounge Radio
32000	38000	Hello my friends out there on the internet, welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
38000	46000	It is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight with episode number 789 for this, August 18th of 2019.
46000	52000	My name is Rob Roberts and joining me in studio, welcome back actually tonight because she was out last week.
52000	58000	You can see her little bob there on stream, her little red bob with the hair, but it's DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
58000	59000	Hi.
59000	60000	Hi, how are you?
60000	61000	I'm annoyed.
61000	62000	You're annoyed? I'm sorry to hear that.
62000	72000	One of the stories that I need apparently, it didn't have a problem with my ad block on my one computer and it doesn't like it on this one, so.
72000	75000	Well you're not supposed to use ad block, how are those sites supposed to make money?
75000	77000	Like that.
77000	88000	No I, when it gets intrusive, I have no, see I think the way that they advertise at vognetwork.com, this little website I may or may not be affiliated with, I like the way they do it because it's unobtrusive.
88000	93000	It doesn't do like autoplay videos and all that garbage, that's the stuff that drives me bonkers.
93000	94000	I have an idea.
94000	96000	When it's like autoplay videos and things like that.
96000	98000	I'm going to refresh it, select all and copy.
98000	103000	Alright, while DarkSakura is sleuthing over there, say hello to Techmaster Loki.
103000	104000	Hello.
104000	105000	How are you Loki?
105000	106000	I'm fine.
106000	115000	Well of course we do broadcast over on Twitch TV, over at twitch.tv slash vognetwork every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.
115000	119000	Although we're going to be going on a little bit of a hiatus, just for two weeks, but I'll explain that in a moment.
119000	121000	I've been warning you guys for a couple weeks.
121000	126000	But the reason why I say that is because even though of course we tape everything, it's a podcast that gets put out there for free and all that stuff.
126000	132000	Now that we're on Twitch, and we have been for you know six or seven months, people get to like see us and our wardrobe choices.
132000	134000	And your wardrobe choice today Techmaster Loki.
134000	136000	Oh you can't see it in his laptop.
136000	138000	Well that too, but it blends into the background.
138000	143000	Can you stand up or something? Because you've got this little like bread cat thing.
143000	147000	But both DarkSakura and I said the same thing when you walked in with that.
147000	149000	We were both like, is that President Cat?
149000	150000	No.
150000	152000	That's a President Cat shirt. That looks like President Cat.
152000	156000	It sort of does, because President Cat has like additional cat ears.
156000	161000	I don't know what kind of like mask head thing it was wearing.
161000	163000	It's actually wearing like a cat mask.
163000	165000	A cat wearing a cat mask.
165000	167000	Yes, it's a cat wearing a cat mask. Yes.
167000	174000	No, this is a bread cat or inbred cat or they call it cat breading. Sometimes it's like a meme thing.
174000	178000	It's actually a shirt from YouTuber William Osman who I watch.
178000	180000	And so I saw it because it's a stupid cat shirt.
180000	183000	And I'm like, you know, I'd love to wear that on the show.
183000	187000	Plus it's super soft. And so why not?
187000	193000	All right. Comfort and coolness here on Orange Lounge Radio.
193000	197000	All right. Going to our chat. Run, jump, stomp and chat says, sorry, I'm new.
197000	202000	What is President Cat? We have to re-explain the OLRN jokes once in a while.
202000	206000	OK, so here's here's the crazy thing. This is one of those rare instances where Orange Lounge Radio,
206000	211000	our little show, actually got like big media coverage on all the big gaming websites and everything.
211000	219000	OK, so here and here's the hilarious thing. If you Google President Cat, you actually get the obscure Japanese Wii game.
219000	221000	I might be mispronouncing. Sorry. Sukeban.
221000	223000	Sukeban Shacho Rena Wii.
223000	225000	Thank you. I was I would have been close, but that.
225000	230000	OK, so this was this very obscure Wii game that apparently didn't sell very well either.
230000	234000	But we were talking about we it was during our release date segment.
234000	236000	We've been doing the release dates for years and years. Right.
236000	240000	And you know how sometimes when we're going over release dates, we get a little distracted because we're like, what is this game?
240000	243000	What is this game? Will this happen with this game?
243000	249000	Because Dark Sakura said something like, does that name translate to like the president cat or something?
249000	254000	And so we started looking at videos of it and then we started calling it President Cat because it does translate.
254000	257000	It doesn't necessarily mean like a real president. It's more like the CEO.
257000	259000	Yeah. No, it doesn't mean like Obama president.
259000	262000	Sukeban is a delinquent woman.
262000	269000	Yes. So but we just started calling it President Cat for short because we thought it was a funny title because I think it was an election.
269000	276000	Wasn't it 2008? I think it was. And the reason why I reference Obama, because I remember our viewers then on Twitter went crazy.
276000	281000	And sorry, listeners. And we actually got like one of those Obama posters for like hope.
281000	285000	But it was President Cat's picture. So.
285000	288000	And OK, but here's the part that really got crazy.
288000	292000	So we were telling everybody because this was when Twitter was still kind of new.
292000	296000	So we found the developer on Twitter and we were like, start.
296000	299000	You got to send the developer messages. We need this in America.
299000	305000	Why don't. And it became this whole conversation about shovelware on the Wii and how we get all this garbage on the Wii.
305000	308000	Like we get these just garbage games on Nintendo Wii.
308000	314000	But we never get these like random ass titles out of Japan that just do something different like this.
314000	318000	So we were like, we demand a localization of President Cat. This has to happen.
318000	322000	So here's why the game blogs picked it up, because we were tweeting the developer.
322000	327000	They responded and they were like, our English isn't very good.
327000	334000	Sorry, but we're so happy that there's such enthusiasm for this game because they they had no fucking idea.
334000	339000	Like, why are these loudmouths in the US? Like, why are we getting spam for this game?
339000	342000	That probably honestly was probably not even that big of a game for them.
342000	350000	But like to get noticed over here, you know, in another country, it's kind of especially 10 years ago when Twitter and all that stuff was newer, it was kind of a big deal.
350000	358000	So that's so somehow the game blogs found that. I think one of our listeners emailed Joystiq, which was there at the time.
358000	362000	I think actdeft emailed Joystiq and they actually fucking ran it.
362000	367000	And from there, you know, all the game blogs just copy each other.
367000	376000	So they all copy pasted from Joystiq. And that was the story about how OLR got famous about an obscure Wii game that I don't even think sold well.
376000	382000	Then I think the next article I saw on Kotaku was that it was like the worst selling Wii game of all time in Japan or something like that.
382000	385000	But I don't. It was pretty bad. Yeah. But well, here's the thing.
385000	391000	I don't I want to see the receipts to this day. I never saw the receipts.
391000	398000	They claim and this is on Wikipedia claims that only sold approximately 100 copies.
398000	404000	Where's the receipts? You know, I have one of those copies. I did. I don't know if I gave it away, but I have one.
404000	410000	And you weren't the only OLR listener that like imported it. So I'm like, if there are frickin people, not that I think we have like 100 listeners to import.
410000	415000	But I just have a hard time to believe that like the game would not sell that well. I'm going to look for it right now.
415000	420000	Like, I don't think it sold buckets and buckets. It was I have judgment probably sold.
420000	425000	Yeah, it was on. It was destructoid that was running it.
425000	430000	I think we're in the Wikipedia. I'm looking at Wikipedia. We were in the Wikipedia for a beautiful Katamari for some time, too.
431000	437000	Anyway, these are these are moments when OLR had like half a moment of fame. Run Jump Stomp says this is an awesome story.
437000	440000	We are. We're linked to the destructoid article.
440000	446000	Oh, how funny. Anyway, but to this day, I still stand by what I said.
446000	453000	There's not enough risk taking going on. It's getting a lot better, especially, you know, in 2008, everything was still region locked.
453000	456000	Right. But in this day and age, things aren't really region locked anymore.
456000	461000	Oh, it was joystick, but I know. OK, nobody has the fucking receipts.
461000	464000	They're all referencing each other. Nobody is showing the cold, hard sales data.
464000	468000	So I call shenanigans on that sales number.
468000	474000	But anyway, things have gotten a lot better because we don't have the region locking anymore.
474000	478000	So a lot of those like crazier niche titles, like if you want it, you just buy it.
478000	481000	You know, you don't have to worry about it. You just buy it. It runs on your system.
481000	485000	So a lot of that's gotten better. But I'm going to pay 80 bucks for it, though.
485000	490000	I'm still always surprised how many like trash games come out.
490000	492000	But then like Crayola scoot. Yeah.
492000	496000	Or that fucking Garfield cart. Let's just call it what it is.
496000	499000	That Garfield cart game we talked about last week or two weeks ago.
499000	504000	I'm sorry. But, you know, in the words of my lord and master, Jasmine Masters.
504000	510000	Well, just as I thought, trash like that game is not going to be good.
510000	513000	So anyway. All right.
513000	516000	Looking for some other comments in chat. Let's see. Oh, yes.
516000	523000	And Bobby had pointed out that Joystick always was really good about covering indie podcasts back in the day.
523000	527000	Yes, that is true. They're one of the game blogs that I actually truly miss.
527000	530000	I forgot. They actually do follow me on Twitter, too.
530000	532000	Oh, is their Twitter account still up?
532000	534000	They haven't posted since 2010.
534000	536000	What's their handle on Twitter?
536000	538000	It's Renawee.
539000	542000	So you just can I get another Twitter campaign?
542000	547000	Can we tweet them and just say I miss you?
547000	550000	We miss President Cat. We still want President Cat.
550000	555000	Still thinking of President Cat in 2018. President Cat for 2020.
555000	558000	For real. For real. All right. Anyway.
558000	565000	Oh, that's a lot of silliness at the top of the show about a random game that we were trying to get localized on the Wii that didn't go very far.
566000	568000	All right. Anyway. Yeah.
568000	571000	Run, jump, stomp. I need someone to find it for me.
571000	573000	Find what for you? Oh, the game. The game.
573000	577000	Well, if it really only did sell that many copies, it probably is a collector's item.
577000	579000	And Loki was really dumb to get rid of his.
579000	581000	I don't know if I got rid of mine. I think I still have it, actually.
581000	587000	I'm just saying I don't if I gave it to somebody would have been the dark Sakura right here to like.
587000	591000	I really actually do want to play it because I have the emulator that will run it.
591000	597000	Yeah, I'm sure there's a I mean, you know, if you want to go to darker sides of the Internet, there's it's probably out there in an image form.
597000	603000	But anyway, and if you go and the funny thing is like, again, I don't want to like sound ego or anything like that.
603000	610000	But maybe just this once we named it President Cat, because, again, it doesn't really directly titled a president cat.
610000	614000	It's supposed to be like CEO or boss cat, I think would actually be like a better title.
614000	618000	But we called it President Cat. And that's the name that fucking stuck just for the record.
618000	624000	Go to YouTube. Look at President Cat. That's what people and then a couple of years. This is the last I'll say it.
624000	629000	And then I swear we'll move on. A couple of years ago, that indie studio, what were they called?
629000	634000	Oh, a rock or oh, look, a rock. So that they made that game at President Cat president.
634000	640000	And we actually had that guy on the show just to ask him, did you know about President Cat?
640000	643000	And for the record, the answer was no. But that guy makes some hilarious games.
643000	648000	He's still making games and stuff. So we support what cat president people are doing, too.
648000	656000	I posted the article. Oh, good. In in chat, the distracted one, the one I found that was the one that was linked from wiki.
656000	661000	OK, nice. We're all over that one. I know. Anyway, I want to read this car for run, jump, stomp.
661000	664000	And we really need to get into our kickoff topic. It wasn't supposed to be about this 10 year old game.
664000	669000	But run, jump, stomp says, you know what I hate about game blogs is that they never, ever give sources.
669000	674000	Instead, they link to other stories about the same topic. Oh, T right there.
674000	684000	That is one of the biggest issues with like the gaming blogs and everything is that, you know, it's just like one thing trickles down from one site to another.
684000	690000	Now, look, before you all drag me, expose me. I realize here at L.R., we're reading stuff that's from game blogs.
690000	695000	But I would like to think we're not a news reporting show. I'm not here to report the news. I'm here to talk about it.
695000	702000	There's a big difference. So but in the world of like reporting, I think what run, jump, stomp is saying is absolutely right.
702000	709000	You know, is that it's just a lot of like copy pasting from other sites, but which makes it really hard to fact check.
709000	715000	But I mean, is celebrity news any different? Not really. Is again, it makes it really hard to fact check.
715000	724000	And is the regular news any better? I mean, when Reddit identifies a gunman incorrectly.
724000	731000	I bet you a lot of news sources have already run with that. Now, you know, say what you will about the phrase fake news and all of that.
731000	740000	But I mean, they're in this day and age. There's a lot of like we have to take some of what we read out there with a grain of salt because there's a lot of slanted stuff out there, too.
740000	748000	Not just that. People will post news from like five years ago. Oh, that's the other big thing. Yes. Oh, my gosh. Is the old news.
748000	756000	And I even get caught every so often because it'll like have a posting date and then have a posted from underneath it.
756000	764000	So the article itself will have been a repost of an article from like a year ago. And I'm like, what the fuck? Don't do that.
764000	772000	It's hard. And we've fallen only once or twice. But it's happening on our we read a story that we realized, wait a minute, this is this is something that was talked about like a year ago.
773000	783000	What was I gonna say? Oh, like just in the past two weeks, I saw on Facebook somebody was like, OMG, I can't believe it. Rest in peace, Gene Wilder. I can't believe he passed away.
783000	789000	I'm like, yeah, he died like years ago. Like, sorry to say sorry to make bad news even worse.
789000	800000	It's like even with the the Epstein thing. I had to go dig to find like coroner listed this.
800000	806000	I'm like, I still have my suspicions about all that, but we won't go into that big pile of shit.
806000	813000	We all get I mean, when it comes to like, let's say video game news, let's go back on top of the video game news. We all get fooled once in a while.
813000	820000	Like it's it's it's me because I'm perfect. Girl, I got receipts on you.
820000	825000	Let's go back to a previous or episode, dark to see a roll tape. All right.
825000	830000	Anyway, you do. And I will find you. All right.
830000	838000	Moving on. Let's get into the actual kickoff topic I want to get into tonight, which is about Nintendo and music on YouTube.
839000	846000	YouTube channels are getting copyright claim strikes from Nintendo because what they're doing is they're posting in-game music.
846000	849000	One channel that is happening is Gilva Sunner.
849000	856000	I hope I'm saying that right. Who launched their YouTube channel back in 2010 has over eight hundred and sixty two million views.
856000	860000	And what they do, they upload official game soundtracks.
860000	866000	And so Nintendo basically shut them down because, I mean, essentially the music is kind of copyright.
866000	873000	Right. Right. So, I mean, for the most part, we can sit here and say, well, I mean, Nintendo, they're kind of there.
873000	878000	They're in their right. They're taking their ball and going home. But you can't say they don't have a legal leg to stand on.
878000	888000	Right. But some folks feel this is a little more tricky, like the situation has some more, I guess, sides to it.
888000	894000	Ramification. I guess so. I don't know. Anyway, here's the thing. Nintendo has no official alternative.
894000	902000	So like if somebody wants to listen to a soundtrack, you can't just log on a Spotify or iTunes and listen to all Nintendo music.
902000	907000	Like, you know, some obviously bits and pieces here and there are on streaming, especially third party companies.
907000	912000	But Nintendo does not have their own official solution outside of maybe in-game and Smash Brothers.
912000	916000	There are so many songs, but we know a lot is missing. It doesn't have everything.
916000	920000	So this is why people go to YouTube because they can't really get it anywhere else.
920000	924000	Funny enough, this kind of ties into what we were talking about at the beginning of the show. Right.
924000	932000	With President Cat is that when people can't get a copy of that easy and they want to play something, they just pirate it.
932000	935000	Right. I was going to say that that's probably what we're going to have to do with the soundtracks.
935000	941000	And so if we can't listen to them on there, we can't find a way to buy them. Right. Piracy it is.
941000	946000	I remember back in the day when I wanted to listen to a soundtrack for a game and I couldn't import it.
946000	950000	If it was on PlayStation, I had a music ripper. All those busting.
950000	957000	The early bad quality MP3 is a bust to move that are out there were me. I'm not joking.
957000	967000	So I've done this with DDR because remember when Oren now we got to go way back when y'all put on your put on your hats and let's go time traveling.
967000	972000	So way back in the early days of OLR, I'm talking 2004.
972000	986000	So because we were set up to do a radio show on live 365 from our computer and we had a nice at the time sound card allowing us to do show do so, which by the way, still in this computer to this day.
986000	996000	We switched our video broadcasting to the Mac Mini, but the computer I used to do some of my own research and stuff, the PC here still has that Sound Blaster card from 2002 in this computer to this day.
996000	1022000	But my point is, because I could plug in a source and using what you hear rip stuff from games basically, the way I got MP3s to play on Orange Launch Radio, the station on live 365 and how we were able to get new music from like DDR Max USA and get things like Dark Black Forest and things that weren't actually on a CD at that point or very easily obtainable and you couldn't get the DDR at it.
1022000	1034000	I ripped them from the games and did that and was able to have them on the station. And like, I didn't really put them on the internet for mass consumption because I wasn't trying to lend to piracy, but you know how it goes.
1034000	1049000	Then some of my friends who are mods on DDR Freak, Dark Soccer, others might be like, Hey, can I get a copy of those songs? Sure, of course, I'll give them to you. And then they pass it. So even though we weren't putting them up on Napster, I'm sure they made their way around somehow.
1049000	1059000	For the record, I only ever shared copies with actually come to think of it.
1059000	1061000	Actually, a lot of people.
1061000	1066000	No, no, I think it was only with Jessica when DDR Freak Radio was coming out.
1066000	1095000	It's fine. It's fine. Like, I don't even like who cares at this point, right? The whole thing was free promo for Konami anyway, right? Like, we weren't even playing the full songs. We were playing the edits. Who cares at this point, right? But like, it's just funny how like, yeah, I've been I was ripping stuff from games too, because I had the computer to do it. Thanks to the live 65 and all that stuff. Oh, I remember. I remember when like, Shane would ask me like, there would be this artist that had songs on his MySpace page that you couldn't actually buy. He'd be like, Can you rip that song from MySpace for me? Sure.
1095000	1116000	Right through the thing. Rip them that way. So yeah. All right. Anyway, fifth dream today says you're the reason PT never got made into Silent Hills. No, no, that isn't that isn't true whatsoever. Five year anniversary of that, by the way. Oh, yeah, that's all that posted on one of the sites. Yeah, toast to that. Anyway.
1116000	1140000	Anyway, where were we? Nintendo copyright music. So there were other YouTube channels getting shut down as well. Brawl Burst mystery. I don't know how to say this guy's name got shut down as well. The Pokemon company did some notices to Pokemon re orchestrated. So could it be that Nintendo is doing this in preparation of launching their own music service on
1140000	1169000	or unloading their CDs on Spotify and iTunes like Namco and Square Enix have done recently? I'm hopeful that they are but I think it's just them being dicks as usual. Because they have the right to do it. It's fine. Yeah, I mean, they're within their rights. You know, like, it's it's hard to say, Oh, they're complete assholes for doing it. But it is just one of those things that well, why now? You know, a lot of it does end up being promo for the game. I'm actually curious. I want to ask this too, because very rarely do I find that I've listened to them.
1170000	1193000	I've listened to soundtracks on YouTube. But I bet like how many of you guys listen to Nintendo songs on YouTube? So dark soccer is raising your hand. Do you do you listen to Nintendo stuff on YouTube? Sometimes? I'll just play stuff in the background. I mean, not just Nintendo stuff, of course, but like, when you get to the classic game of the week, this. Sure. This time, you'll know one of the things I was listening to on repeat. Okay, that's that's fair.
1193000	1220000	Guys, you don't chat says Twitch is going to have a radio channel radio Nintendo. Now, obviously, that's not fact just forecasting. But who knows Nintendo could do. I would love it if Nintendo made it a part of Nintendo switch online to have like a virtual jukebox. That would be awesome. I just think that sounds like too much effort for Nintendo's online stuff that like I just I'm not even if I just want a list of Nintendo soundtracks. I should just buy Smash Brothers because true.
1220000	1249000	Yeah, true. SSU 100. Matt says or tinfoil hat into Oh, says same thing. Nintendo is going to do its own streaming music service on Nintendo online. I wish I wish that was the case. But I just don't have faith that Nintendo is going to take that kind of effort. And it's a bummer because I would love it. Can you imagine imagine like if you could set that up with Nintendo online, and you could download like 30 tracks to your switch to take with you, or like have a random assortment or something like Nintendo's got a legendary library.
1250000	1279600	With my switch, I would love it. Oh, you wouldn't do that with your friends. I don't take my switch anywhere. I would. I'm not gonna take my switch anywhere until Animal Crossing comes out. And even then I kind of chatted with Dan about getting the other switch. Now metal mayhem and chat says to be honest, I'd buy Nintendo music via iTunes if it was sold there. Same I would love it if it went to Apple Music and Spotify and whatever, whatever other streaming things I'm missing. But you know, the whole buffet of streaming services similar to what Namco Bandai and
1280360	1300640	Square Enix have recently done. Like it would be great if Nintendo is following in those footsteps. And that seems like the more practical option is that that long coming Nintendo Apple partnership is music. It's just there's there's songs on iTunes. But it would be great if they'd include Spotify and all the other stuff as well. But I suppose anything's possible. So
1300640	1312240	Miltonious Games in our chat says Nintendo will get to cassettes soon with their tech. Oh yeah, baby. Eight tracks. Super Mario Brothers, eight tracks.
1312240	1318960	I'm still waiting for DAT. You know, like, you know, I know, I know, I know. Mini disc.
1318960	1332000	S2100 Matt says Nintendo is like Disney, they only want to offer stuff on their own platform. Okay, well, hey, if Nintendo does that type of innovation and adds that for Nintendo Switch Online, that would be great. I would love that honestly. That would be great.
1332000	1351120	Act F says if I recall correctly, there are Pokemon soundtracks on iTunes for sale. I believe you are correct. But that is also because Pokemon is from the Pokemon company and is not technically a Nintendo first party game. So that's why it's treated a little bit differently. So
1351120	1369120	Nifty 805 says does the new Switch model support Bluetooth headphones? I don't believe so. So Rum Jump Stomp says but they have their own platform on our phones already. The Nintendo Switch Online app. It's perfect and would finally make the app useful. Oh, that's a really good call out.
1369120	1381120	They can't make anything useful though. Yeah, I know. Again, I totally I completely understand and love the criticism that Nintendo is not going to do that. They don't they don't know how to do it. They've never done anything like that before.
1381120	1397120	It's not that they don't know how to do it. It doesn't fit into what they think it should be. I guess. Nintendo does things the way that they think it should be. Yeah. Not the way that things are, or the way that things have always been done, but the way they think it should be done. And they want everyone to follow suit.
1397120	1419120	So I think it should be done how Rum Jump Stomp says it because that's a great call out is that that phone app is kind of trash. Like there's no reason to have it really unless maybe you need the Splatoon 2 stuff for the in game to see the the gear and stuff but otherwise, that app is pretty trash and people aren't using it they're using Discord or Skype or some other way to talk to your friends.
1419120	1441120	So like if they were to make that app suddenly also their own little mini Spotify, Apple Music etc type of thing that would have access to Nintendo's library music. Okay, I'm into that. And then that also that also kind of dark soccer you wouldn't have to have your switch, you'd have your phone, and you can access the library there. That would be rad. I didn't even know that app existed because I don't play Splatoon.
1441120	1454120	Well, careful, careful because if I have an Animal Crossing thing, they will then I'll use it if they get an Animal Crossing thing. But I don't have any reason to use it. I couldn't get into Splatoon. It makes me motion sick. So I don't play it.
1454120	1483120	Yeah, but there'll be other stuff. We think that they'll you put that put on that app with the YouTube and Nintendo thing. I was gonna say quickly, the channel that I do listen to not that I want Nintendo to shut this down. I really don't. I like the guy that takes the 8-bit music and reprocesses it in stereo. And I don't remember his name we guy 8-bit stereo, something like that. I don't remember the guy's channel. But it's something like that. And I, I will go listen to like the guardian legend soundtrack on that channel. And some of those things because I like
1483120	1491120	what I like how he redid those 8-bit songs in stereo. They sound really good. So that's, that's good. Do you ever listen to video game music on YouTube? Loki?
1491120	1511120	No, not really. I mean, I think last time I listened to something that was sort of video game related, I was listening to the oral nuts talk about they were doing a commentary about the Mortal Kombat soundtrack. You remember remember like the cheesy techno one that they had like
1511120	1523120	like not the movie, not the movie, but like the game where they had like each. I remember that. I do too. I remember that. It had like the pre Utah Saints one that they redid for.
1523120	1540120	Yes. Wasn't it like a free if you ordered for Mortal Monday or something? I don't. I think it was. I don't remember. But they did. They talked about all the different songs on there and like see that's like a total throwback to me because we used to play Cuzar that all the time and the songs are so goddamn cheesy.
1540120	1541120	But it was great.
1541120	1546120	We would also play Cuzar to that and Psychosonic.
1546120	1555120	Okay, if you used to play to the Mortal Kombat soundtrack, then you're going to know this one because can we take a minute to talk about Tracy Lord's music career? Can we can we just have a minute to talk about that?
1555120	1566120	Okay. To this to this day, I have my 90s dancey pop list that has Outlaw Lover on it and Control.
1566120	1572120	Control was the song in the Mortal Kombat set. That song is a fucking bop. Like I'll fight you on it. Like Tracy Lord's control.
1572120	1579120	The dance was a very good live. What's that? Dance that she wasn't very good live. You saw her with Moby and she actually was a live performer.
1579120	1590120	See, here's the thing. If you didn't know about Tracy Lord's, here's the thing. She was like big back in the day because I think she did it was underage porn. She was 17, 16.
1590120	1608120	So obviously that is all kind of like, you know, right. But here's because she turned that around into making a career for herself out of that, which so many people were trying to shame when she was a victim, not a, you know, perpetuator. Does that make sense?
1608120	1617120	Yeah. So, yeah, like, then she was also in a bunch of just movies after that then. Right, right. She did. She was in all the John Waters movies after that.
1617120	1628120	She was a, she was a juror in a serial mom and she was, yeah, she was in all the John Waters movies at some point. And she had that show on NBC for a while. The protagonist, what was that show called?
1628120	1637120	I'd have to look it up. She was on a TV show on NBC that was on for a long time and then she had her awesome techno career. So there was that. Thank you.
1637120	1652120	All right. Oh, yes. Tangent time speaking of Mortal Kombat. So it's old is new again, right? All the 90s stuff is coming back. I was at Target yesterday and saw the 90s game like, because that's where we're at. Yeah, that's where we're at now.
1652120	1655120	You know what I saw? The Trapper Keeper game.
1655120	1657120	Oh, God. But anyway,
1657120	1678120	I was listening to actually because on the way to play laser tag again today, we were listening to like, I was making my kids listen to music that I used to listen to when we'd go play laser tag and one of the artists was Scooter did like, you know, the song Fire, which was featured in Dancing Stage, Disney grave.
1678120	1695120	That artist is so terrible. I don't know why I love that, but like he takes like a decent techno song or hardcore song and then just like sings over it with the most ridiculous lyrics that make no fucking sense whatsoever.
1695120	1704120	He has a song called How Much is the Fish? I mean, like none of it makes any fucking sense whatsoever. You actually listen to the lyrics. Wait a second.
1704120	1717120	What the fuck is this shit? Maybe it's a dare to see if people actually listen to the lyrics. I think it's because he tends to play to like large, you know, rave type audiences and stuff like that, where probably everybody's inebriated anyways.
1717120	1732120	And so it's like, oh yeah, fuck. Awesome. You know, he's yelling shit. Yeah, let's get into it. But like, I don't know. It's just, it's really weird. Like, I just like, wow. Why did I, I mean, Fire's good, but like the rest of this music, eh, I don't know.
1732120	1746120	Okay. Tracy Lord's important. The show she was on was called Profiler. That was the show she was on on NBC. She was on the second season. I thought, I thought it was her show, but she was just on the second season, but she also apparently was on Melrose Place at some point.
1746120	1760120	So there you go. Tracy Lord's. The more you know. For the record, one of the folks, because I mentioned Psychosonic earlier, their music was in a SNES game only in the United States.
1760120	1781120	And it like had the best stuff on there too. It had that, the whole album, Psychosonic, was just great. But one of their, Paul Sebastian from the group went on to become the audio director for Epic Games and did the soundtracks for Gears, produced the soundtracks for Gears of War.
1781120	1782120	Oh, that's awesome.
1782120	1787120	Yeah, he was their vocalist.
1787120	1799120	Okay. Um, so I brought up the nineties with good reason. We got on a tangent. What else happens here at OLR? Because there's updates on the Mortal Kombat movie, the whole Mortal Kombat movie, which better have that song in the soundtrack.
1799120	1809120	If I don't hear the Utah Saints Mortal Kombat song in the new movie, like throw it in the trash, throw it in the trash. It is not a real Mortal Kombat. I rebuke it in the name of the Lord.
1809120	1818120	It is a trash film if it does not have the Mortal Kombat song in it. And I think we all owe it to ourselves to protest the movie if the Mortal Kombat-
1818120	1821120	It'll be dubstep. They'll do a dubstep version.
1821120	1822120	Anyway.
1822120	1824120	Is Utah Saints even still around?
1824120	1830120	Bring them back. Everybody reunites now. Come on. Everybody's going on their reunion tours. Bring them back. Anyway.
1831120	1842120	What I meant to say was that the Mortal Kombat movie has cast some more characters. So it's Roland now. They've cast people. So Ludi Lin, I hope I said that name right, from the movie Aquaman and Power Rangers is playing Liu Kang.
1842120	1856120	Cissy Stringer is playing Mileena. Mashad Brooks from Supergirl and True Blood is playing Jax. And Tadonobu Asano, I'm sorry if I butchered that name, is from Thor Ragnarok.
1856120	1865120	And Mongold, The Rise of Genghis Khan is negotiating to play Raiden. So there's movement happening on the Mortal Kombat movie. It's happening.
1865120	1869120	I still want Ronda Rousey for Sonya.
1870120	1872120	I actually like her in the game.
1872120	1873120	She's a choice.
1873120	1875120	I actually like her voice acting.
1875120	1878120	Usually the voice actors don't end up crossing over into the actual movie.
1878120	1880120	But she looks like she could do it.
1880120	1881120	That so rarely happens.
1881120	1884120	She has the look. She could do the character.
1884120	1886120	Yeah. Anyway.
1886120	1887120	Alright.
1887120	1897120	Dark Tetsuya says, Oh, I'm sure there'll be an updated remix of it. There better be. I don't want it if they're not going to do it. Just take the movie out back and yeah.
1897120	1901120	Metal Mayhem says, Christopher Lambert made for a good Raiden.
1901120	1902120	No, he didn't.
1902120	1903120	I liked him.
1903120	1906120	He's blind as a fucking bat. He shouldn't have been in acting.
1906120	1908120	That movie had to have.
1908120	1909120	Since Highlander.
1909120	1913120	Okay. That movie had to have some star power in it, though, for people to want to see it.
1913120	1916120	And because he was Highlander, like, they had to have somebody.
1916120	1918120	So, like, I'm glad I'm glad he did it.
1918120	1920120	But he didn't come back for the sequel, right?
1920120	1922120	Not to my memory.
1922120	1923120	Anyway.
1923120	1926120	That sequel is like an hour and a half of my life I wish I could have back.
1926120	1929120	Well, Bobby Black Wolf in chat says, Mortal Kombat was the true sequel to Highlander.
1929120	1930120	True.
1930120	1933120	Like, there's this whole fan theory online.
1933120	1934120	Yeah.
1934120	1936120	About how, like, Highlander became the Thunder God.
1936120	1938120	And like, it's a it's all.
1938120	1940120	That was the prize.
1940120	1944120	Well, then again, with all of the electrocution that happened.
1944120	1949120	And of course, the second Highlander movie was, I'm sorry, garbage.
1949120	1952120	I don't know. I saw Highlander three in the theater.
1952120	1954120	Which one was the one? They all had Sean Connery.
1954120	1956120	I was like, which one was Sean Connery?
1956120	1957120	To one extent.
1957120	1963120	But the first one was the big one with Sean Connery with a Scotsman playing a Spaniard.
1963120	1965120	Ramirez.
1965120	1966120	Right. Right.
1966120	1968120	I'm like, really? That's some weird casting.
1968120	1973120	Of course, they also had Montalban playing a Japanese man once.
1973120	1974120	OK.
1974120	1976120	With prosthetics.
1976120	1977120	All right.
1977120	1978120	Yeah.
1978120	1979120	Well, I love my Internet conspiracy theories.
1979120	1984120	So the Mortal Kombat being a sequel to Highlander, that's a good one.
1984120	1988120	What's your favorite Internet conspiracy theory?
1988120	1994120	Well, I mean, I like the one about all of the Pixar movies being in the same universe.
1994120	1997120	But I like.
1997120	2000120	Chats, what's your favorite Internet conspiracy theory?
2000120	2002120	There was another one, though, that was very recent.
2002120	2004120	And one of my friends even mentioned it now.
2004120	2005120	I can't remember.
2005120	2006120	I like it.
2006120	2007120	It's only mine is so easy.
2007120	2008120	Hands down. Go ahead.
2008120	2018120	I know it's totally debunked, but I like the one that I guess is a fan theory that, you know, Kevin McCallister from Home Alone became the jigsaw killer.
2018120	2020120	I like that. It's good. It's good.
2020120	2023120	Yeah. My favorite Internet conspiracy theories is so easy.
2023120	2029120	Nothing. Nothing compares to the Internet conspiracy theory that Avril Lavigne died like five years ago and she's been replaced with a clone.
2029120	2033120	That is by far my favorite Internet conspiracy theory.
2033120	2034120	It's so good.
2034120	2037120	Like movies or games.
2037120	2039120	Oh, no, I didn't I didn't say movies or games.
2039120	2042120	Come on. This is Orange Lounge Radio.
2042120	2043120	We talk about games on here.
2043120	2045120	We pigeonhole ourselves in one small category.
2045120	2050120	Give me a break.
2050120	2052120	The chat is no Google it.
2052120	2054120	It's it's so good.
2054120	2062120	Like the Avril Lavigne died and got replaced by like Karen or I don't know what her name is, but like because she's been gone for a while and then she came back.
2062120	2063120	So she'd been gone.
2063120	2064120	Yeah.
2064120	2065120	Wait, that's Kelly Carson.
2065120	2070120	All right. Anyway, Bobby Blackwell says favorite Internet conspiracy theory.
2070120	2073120	Australia doesn't actually exist.
2073120	2076120	And everyone that claims it does are actors.
2076120	2080120	That's getting into the Flat Earth society.
2080120	2085120	I do have a popular one right now, although it's a lot more serious is that I do.
2085120	2089120	I'm sort of going along with the theory about Epstein right now.
2089120	2091120	Yeah, that's that's too serious. Too soon.
2091120	2092120	It is.
2092120	2100120	But right now, that is kind of the one that I've had this minor obsession with because it makes I don't know.
2100120	2103120	It makes way too much sense with as much as he knew about people.
2103120	2105120	Guys, you don't chat making up one.
2105120	2111120	I made up my own Internet conspiracy theory that the Scott Pilgrim movie and Ready Player One are in the same universe.
2111120	2113120	All right. Anyway. All right.
2113120	2114120	Let's move on. This is getting ridiculous.
2114120	2116120	Sorry, guys. Let's get into our gaming weeks.
2116120	2118120	Let's bring it back to video games.
2118120	2121120	I guess if I can't talk about clones.
2121120	2124120	All right. I think I'm a clone.
2124120	2128120	How is your gaming week? What types of video games have you been playing this week?
2128120	2129120	Our soccer will start with you.
2129120	2135120	I reckon I had two weeks of gaming week because I went to see Weird Al.
2135120	2137120	Yeah, I forgot to ask you about the concert.
2137120	2139120	We just kind of hit the ground running with the show.
2139120	2140120	It was amazing.
2140120	2141120	Of course it was.
2141120	2145120	And he goes through this whole thing like I've never done this one song live.
2145120	2151120	I never had an opportunity to do the song justice because I needed an orchestra.
2151120	2153120	And he turns, I have an orchestra now.
2153120	2155120	So he did Harvey the Winter Hamster.
2155120	2163120	And I'm sad because I was going to record him doing Jurassic Park, which I knew he had to do Jurassic Park having an orchestra.
2163120	2166120	And he did it. It was great.
2166120	2168120	And I had accidentally hit stop.
2168120	2170120	I was very sad.
2170120	2176120	The orchestra actually opened up with the Raiders march from Indiana Jones.
2176120	2179120	And then they did Mission Impossible.
2179120	2183120	And then they did a Star Wars medley.
2183120	2185120	And it was really...
2185120	2188120	So they did like nerdy things to the crowd to get him hyped a little bit.
2188120	2190120	Like did he have an official opening act or was like the orchestra...
2190120	2191120	It was the orchestra.
2191120	2192120	Okay, okay.
2192120	2196120	So the orchestra just, they were amazing.
2196120	2198120	But it was just great.
2198120	2202120	I mean the one song that I never like when it gets done was Weasel Stomping Day.
2202120	2206120	I hate Weasel Stomping Day. It's like the one Weird Al song I super do not like.
2206120	2208120	But they did Weasel Stomping Day.
2208120	2210120	Because that high pitched squeal just ugh.
2210120	2212120	Did they ever do the theme the Spy Hard?
2212120	2214120	I've heard him do Spy Hard.
2214120	2216120	But they didn't do it.
2216120	2220120	Actually I'd take that back. They did do, I think he did do Spy Hard.
2220120	2222120	You've seen Weird Al a lot of times.
2222120	2225120	I've seen Weird Al a lot. So don't ask me what he did because I don't remember.
2225120	2231120	At least three times in recent memory that I can think of that you've missed this show to go see a Weird Al Yankovic show.
2231120	2237120	I have seen Weird Al, I think I'm just short of 20 times now.
2237120	2238120	Wow.
2238120	2239120	Like 18 times.
2239120	2240120	Wow.
2240120	2244120	Because I've been to the fair like every year and seen him.
2244120	2251120	That time I've been, then we went to Fresno to see him and then I went to...
2252120	2257120	I mean I love Weird Al. Don't get me wrong. I love Weird Al. He's just so like cool.
2257120	2260120	We went last year. We went the year before.
2260120	2266120	Actually last year was anniversary 12. That was after DragCon. I went the year before that.
2266120	2268120	And then we had the meet and greets for our 10th anniversary.
2268120	2270120	So no I'm just actually trying to think about it now.
2270120	2272120	But yeah I've seen Al a lot.
2272120	2280120	More than any other, I'll put it this way. I've never seen any act twice except for Weird Al.
2280120	2283120	Even Margaret Cho? Because I was like, we went to see Margaret Cho 8 times.
2283120	2284120	Well I'm talking about Musician.
2284120	2285120	Okay Musician. Okay.
2285120	2287120	I've seen Margaret Cho live 3 times.
2287120	2289120	I've seen Margaret Cho live like 8 times. But anyway.
2289120	2292120	And I also got to see George Cartland before he died.
2292120	2293120	Oh wow.
2293120	2294120	It was terrible.
2294120	2295120	Alright games. Your gaming week.
2295120	2302120	So I played on my phone stuff. I have been playing a lot of The Sims 4.
2302120	2307120	I just purchased two more packs because they had them like half price the sale price.
2307120	2313120	And apparently Origin still thinks I'm paying for Origin access even though I cancelled it like 4 months ago.
2313120	2315120	So I got the discounts from that.
2315120	2321120	And so I am playing a lot of The Sims 4. Most of it is just like me remaking existing Sims.
2321120	2323120	Like I'm remaking the Goth family right now.
2323120	2329120	Because Bella has needed a touch up for some time.
2329120	2330120	Bella Ligothy?
2330120	2333120	No. Bella Goth. Bella Goth.
2333120	2343120	Anyway. And. I don't know. We're not really playing a whole lot of stuff that isn't pinball lately.
2343120	2347120	So yeah. Pinball in The Sims and my phone games.
2347120	2350120	Alright. We'll go over to Loki. How was your gaming week?
2350120	2357120	I didn't play a whole ton. I did play a little bit of Pokemon Go.
2357120	2361120	I actually did part of one of the raids the other day because I just happened to be eating dinner.
2361120	2368120	And it's like oh yeah sure I've got to compete in a raid for this one weekly challenge thing.
2368120	2372120	And so I did that and oh there's 8 other people in here. Okay sure we'll take down this 5 star thing.
2372120	2376120	And so we did. And I'm like I already have this but whatever it's fine.
2376120	2378120	Was it the shiny Succoon thing?
2378120	2380120	It wasn't shiny but it was just regular.
2380120	2384120	Well you had an attempt to get it shiny. You had to do a lot of raids to get it shiny though unless you have really good luck.
2384120	2391120	Yeah so it was that thing. And then I've just been playing a little bit because now that my gotchas charged.
2391120	2393120	Although I forgot to put it on today.
2393120	2396120	So I've been playing that. But mainly just working in Unity.
2396120	2402120	That's what I've been doing. I finally fixed. I had an issue where I was trying to keep my player on screen.
2402120	2406120	And so I was doing some weird conversion math.
2406120	2413120	And before it was kind of sticking to the, not the actual screen but like the camera viewport.
2413120	2416120	Which allowed me to go off screen which is not good.
2416120	2424120	So now I fixed that. And so now moving on to some level node system thing.
2424120	2428120	And so that's my one game.
2428120	2434120	And then the other thing I was working on was like a curriculum for that thing I was supposed to be teaching.
2434120	2438120	I'm not sure if I'm going to do kart racing or not. That may be too much.
2438120	2444120	I'm seeing. If I can get it simple enough then maybe I will. But I have to actually generate something.
2444120	2449120	Although I did see this other design that someone did. Like a game in 12 hours.
2449120	2456120	And it looked pretty fun. So I was like okay we can make something similar to that.
2456120	2460120	There may be a game jam in a couple weeks. Just saying.
2460120	2463120	Are you planning the curriculum for that class that you're going to do for the kids?
2463120	2467120	Yeah eventually. I don't know what I'm going to do for them though. But I'll figure it out.
2467120	2471120	It's something simple. I have to like figure out what they're as far as learning stuff.
2471120	2478120	Because a lot of them are just still doing JavaScript. Although they're getting a few of them into the like intermediate JavaScript stuff.
2478120	2483120	So it would basically, the problem is a lot of it's going to have to be, okay here's what Unity is like.
2483120	2488120	Here's what we do in Unity. Here's what the difference is between JavaScript and C Sharp.
2488120	2491120	You know it's like minor stuff. So a few classes have to be dedicated to that.
2491120	2495120	So it cuts down the time that you can do stuff really minimally.
2495120	2500120	So like I only have like maybe six hours to teach something or do something.
2500120	2509120	So it may be just really simple stuff. Which you know the one game thing that the guy did in 12 hours looked really simple.
2509120	2512120	So that would be kind of a thing to do. That'd be fun.
2513120	2518120	I just want something also that they can kind of make their own. So I have to figure out what that is too.
2518120	2520120	But yeah. So I'm working on that a little bit.
2520120	2523120	Okay. My gaming week then right?
2523120	2532120	So for the past 51 days I was playing this Survivor LARP that I was talking about on the show.
2532120	2535120	Dark Soccer, remember my Survivor LARP I was talking about?
2535120	2537120	So it's been keeping me away from video games.
2537120	2541120	Well I got to play some more games this week because that game finally ended on Monday.
2541120	2543120	Monday was the last day of the Survivor LARP.
2543120	2549120	And when we last left off I was in the final two. I won unanimously at the end of the game.
2549120	2554120	So out of 22 people out of 22 people I came in first. Like I can't even believe it myself.
2554120	2556120	And you won?
2556120	2558120	I won a blanket.
2558120	2559120	Really?
2559120	2564120	I don't have it yet. So the option was you get to get a blanket with either the season's logo.
2564120	2568120	Because this is you know it's a Facebook thing. This is the ninth season on Facebook.
2568120	2574120	So it's got like 550 people in the community or something. So it's a pretty decently followed game.
2574120	2580120	So you either can get a blanket with the season's logo or you can get your face on it.
2580120	2582120	Now you know damn well which blanket I'm getting.
2582120	2583120	Your face.
2583120	2587120	Absolutely. So I haven't been asked for my shipping address yet.
2587120	2590120	So I'm assuming they are currently in the process of printing my blanket.
2590120	2594120	But I'm hoping maybe by the time-ish that I get back from Dragon Con and all that.
2594120	2595120	It'll be here.
2595120	2597120	We'll have the blanket right here on the couch.
2597120	2602120	We should have had one a blanket made of the exact moment when Mr. Smoosh knocked down the camera.
2602120	2603120	Yes.
2603120	2604120	Yes.
2604120	2606120	Wait. When was this?
2606120	2609120	Oh you missed it. It was the final six challenge.
2609120	2612120	So I talked about this on the last show so I don't repeat myself too much.
2612120	2615120	But basically my camera was on the ground because we had to swing.
2615120	2617120	So you had to put a water bottle in a sock.
2617120	2620120	And you had to swing it around a stack of cups.
2620120	2622120	And keep it going as long as possible.
2622120	2625120	The guy that won went for three and a half hours.
2625120	2626120	Jeez.
2626120	2629120	45 minutes into it. I'm going. I'm still going.
2629120	2631120	Somebody else was already out at this point.
2631120	2635120	But I'm still in it. And Mr. Smoosh comes in. Sees the phone on the ground.
2635120	2636120	Walks in. Walks up to the phone.
2636120	2639120	Knocks my phone over. And then knocks my cups over.
2639120	2642120	And like the host was dying laughing.
2642120	2643120	Like just-
2643120	2644120	I want to see the-
2644120	2646120	Do they have the highlight reel yet?
2646120	2648120	I'm waiting for- Is Jayden out there still listening to OLR?
2648120	2651120	Kilby? Somebody from the production still listening to OLR?
2651120	2653120	Because we need that video clip.
2653120	2656120	Like the listeners are demanding it. I'll chase them down.
2656120	2658120	Somebody has it. I know they do.
2658120	2660120	So I'll find it. It wasn't in the viewer's lounge.
2660120	2661120	Because I was expecting-
2661120	2664120	So there's actually people that watch the game and get to see everything behind the scenes.
2664120	2668120	And so I got to see all the people like commenting about my game.
2668120	2671120	And how basically I wasn't playing the game and letting Tyler play for me.
2671120	2676120	Like the first week and a half of the game was the consensus of the viewer's lounge.
2676120	2678120	But it's fine.
2678120	2682120	I actually- I did have a really rough first week in the game and I couldn't play it all the time.
2682120	2685120	But anyway, yeah. I don't want to spend too much time on that.
2685120	2687120	But it ended and I did win.
2687120	2689120	I met some really great people playing it though.
2689120	2696120	The nice thing is like despite the fact that we played a very intense psychological type of game against each other.
2696120	2700120	Like everybody- I've had to learn how to use Snapchat.
2700120	2703120	Because that's what all the kids use to talk to each other these days.
2703120	2705120	But it blows up like all day long.
2705120	2709120	Still people from that game just talking to each other, sharing about their days and all that good stuff.
2709120	2711120	And some of them do video streaming as well.
2711120	2713120	So Twitch streaming like Nick.
2713120	2715120	So shout out to Nick if you're out there that's getting into Twitch streaming.
2715120	2718120	And DK told me today he wants to do some streaming.
2718120	2722120	He wants to do sports games because there's not a lot of gay guys that stream sports games.
2722120	2723120	So he wants to kind of do that.
2723120	2725120	I was like alright you should. Yeah do that.
2725120	2732120	So shout out- we'll give these channels proper shout outs and hosts or something when they're actually playing.
2732120	2734120	Is he going to call it guy on sports?
2734120	2737120	I don't know what he's going to call it. I have no idea.
2737120	2739120	You know like in living color.
2739120	2740120	Guys on sports.
2740120	2744120	Kaijuto in chat says how did you pull off a unanimous vote? Who were you up against?
2744120	2745120	I thought it was men on sports.
2745120	2747120	Oh it wasn't men on sports? I don't know it's been so long.
2747120	2751120	I was up against a guy who lives in Montreal and I knew-
2751120	2754120	So inactdeft actually watched it live because I tweeted out the link.
2754120	2756120	It was broadcast live the finale and he put a gif.
2756120	2759120	He was like this is like watching a telenovela right now.
2759120	2761120	Like all this drama that's manufactured going on.
2762120	2770120	Well here's the thing. I knew that Felix who was the final- I kind of knew that he had burned bridges with a lot of people.
2770120	2773120	I didn't know how bad it was in some circumstances.
2773120	2777120	But I actually- let the record show I like the guy a lot.
2777120	2783120	Like our interactions are always really good but I knew that the jury was not going to give him a lot of votes.
2783120	2786120	So yeah I took him to the end.
2786120	2788120	Because I did get some criticism for not taking the other girl.
2788120	2793120	I voted her out at final three. Amber who's great. She's a goddess. She's a queen. Let the record show.
2793120	2795120	I stan Amber forever.
2795120	2798120	But I knew she- I thought she'd have jury votes.
2798120	2802120	They're telling me in retrospect that I still would have won against Amber but I didn't believe it.
2802120	2805120	Whereas like I knew I would win against Felix so I took him.
2805120	2810120	So anyway survivor fun right? So yeah that's that was that was it. It was cool.
2810120	2812120	And that is why I don't play these things.
2812120	2816120	I know you are basically volunteering yourself for intense psychological trauma.
2816120	2824120	But at the same time it's like like for me for 50 days it was what I did instead of playing World of Warcraft or Final Fantasy 14 right?
2824120	2827120	It was my MMO that I was playing for a little bit.
2827120	2833120	And like the fact that I did do some things in these intense situations that I never thought I would do.
2833120	2839120	Like winning that final immunity challenge I showed you guys last week with the solo cup that you have to hold in the cat's cradle for as long as possible.
2839120	2843120	Like I never thought I'd be able to do like some of those things and beat kids that are half my age.
2843120	2849120	You know some of this so like overcoming a lot of that was like made me feel really good so I'm glad I did it.
2849120	2855120	I volunteered to help with the next season like I'm not going to be able to spend as much time as I spent playing it.
2855120	2857120	But I offered to use like the green screen to do videos and stuff.
2857120	2863120	So we'll see if they have me I'll let you guys know like if anybody out there is interested.
2863120	2867120	I think it would be fucking hilarious if some OLR people showed up in the next season.
2867120	2869120	I could already tell you what my first episode would be like.
2869120	2871120	I hate y'all bye.
2872120	2878120	Well the nice thing is the reason why I preferred playing it online as to playing it for real is that I didn't have to starve.
2878120	2882120	I was I was well fed the entire time that was the nice part of it so.
2882120	2887120	Yeah and Akdev says it was free and you got a blanket out of it. Yes that is very true.
2887120	2891120	It was very true. Nifty805 says it wasn't RuPaul's best friend race for him.
2891120	2897120	No it was funny because there were some people in the game I never got to talk to because they were voted out pre-jury and we never got to see each other emerge.
2897120	2899120	But I was talking to one of the girls who was great.
2899120	2905120	Shout out Karen if you're out there. I was talking to her and she said that they were all watching the final two.
2905120	2912120	And I guess I said at some point because they asked like why did you refill it so I'm like well you know guys I want to win.
2912120	2915120	And she said that was like everybody was like yes that's great.
2915120	2919120	So anyway all right enough survivor talk but I was just very happy about that.
2919120	2928120	So now that that's done I'm back to playing other video games and I have been playing Final Fantasy 14 more and I beat the Shadowbringers expansion this week.
2928120	2931120	So finally you can help me level when I join. Yeah happy to.
2931120	2937120	Finally beat that and so I'm just before OLR and Bobby tonight I was actually doing a live stream on my own channel.
2937120	2941120	Where I was showing off one of the new jobs Gunbreaker because I'm starting to level that.
2941120	2948120	As I'm yeah I'm leveling that because Shane wanted to do a healer and so tank healer is a great combination to get like instant dungeons.
2948120	2952120	So I was doing some of that on live stream before the Sunday night block tonight.
2952120	2954120	So I've been having fun playing Gunbreaker.
2954120	2959120	And now I can kind of do that because I'm not focusing on the story so I don't have to worry about streaming and doing story spoilers.
2959120	2964120	I'm done with that so that's that's really good but I loved I loved the story.
2964120	2966120	I really did it was so so good.
2967120	2969120	Let's see I've also been playing No Man's Sky.
2969120	2977120	No Man's Sky has its 2.0 version No Man's Sky Beyond just launched this week and I've been playing that on PlayStation 4.
2977120	2984120	And if you guys haven't played No Man's Sky since the first version and you own it and it's sitting in your library collecting dust.
2984120	2986120	You've really got to go back and see what they've changed.
2986120	2988120	It is not the same game.
2988120	2992120	I mean this game has transformed in the way that Diablo 3.
2992120	2993120	Did it get 14'd?
2993120	2995120	Ironically Final Fantasy 14.
2995120	2998120	Destiny I know went through some big changes too.
2998120	3004120	This game has transformed itself in much the same way and you really owe it to yourself to revisit it if you already owned it.
3004120	3007120	If you didn't already own it and you're sitting on the fence like do I buy it do I not?
3007120	3014120	It is on sale right now for 30 bucks at least the Steam version is and you know if you like sci-fi if you like exploration.
3014120	3021120	But I will say the game is a little more Minecraft in the fact that you might be sitting there going what's the point?
3021120	3027120	The point is exploration and building and crafting and those sorts of things that like Minecraft is kind of about.
3027120	3031120	It's like if that is not your kind of game and you don't think you get a lot of rewards from that.
3031120	3038120	I don't know if it would be a smart choice for you but like what I do love about No Man's Sky is in contrast to something like Minecraft.
3038120	3043120	Is that when you go out into space and you land on a planet you don't know what you're going to find next.
3043120	3050120	And I honestly like I love landing on a planet and like now in this new version like some of the monsters you come across are gigantic.
3050120	3052120	And you're like damn what the fuck is that?
3052120	3057120	Like you know and there's these moments that just really like take you away or like dang this this looks really good.
3057120	3059120	This is a great looking planet.
3059120	3062120	It's in VR now so I played it on PlayStation VR.
3062120	3066120	Gonna be honest didn't love it in VR.
3066120	3072120	I played with the controller because you kind of have to aim with the controller when you're playing in VR.
3072120	3075120	I did not have my move controllers charged so I couldn't use that.
3075120	3078120	Didn't love the way that felt.
3078120	3080120	I missed my old controls.
3081120	3089120	They tried to do some things to it to cut back the motion sickness where instead of moving smoothly you like throw yourself forward.
3089120	3094120	You can like choose this is where I want to go to and then it like ports you there to help with some of the motion sickness.
3094120	3096120	So you're not having like a continuous fluid movement.
3096120	3100120	However you can turn the fluid movement on if you want but I thought that was really.
3100120	3102120	Hell yes fluid movement.
3102120	3107120	Right and I like that too but I thought it was great they had the choice for when the fluid movement is too much.
3107120	3110120	I think they do that too in other games too like Skyrim I think.
3110120	3112120	Skyrim absolutely does that as well.
3112120	3115120	Yeah so I thought that was really cool that they offered that.
3115120	3119120	But I'm just gonna be honest like No Man's Sky is beautiful on my TV.
3119120	3124120	But they have to down sample it for the PlayStation VR because the PlayStation VR is a cup.
3124120	3129120	I do have a pro but it's still like you just notice it in the text and things like that.
3129120	3132120	I probably have to get it on PC and play it on my Rift.
3133120	3140120	I'm thinking on PC in the Rift or you know the VR that's there where it doesn't have to like cut back at all.
3140120	3142120	I bet it looks really freaking good.
3142120	3144120	And guys don't like you know don't.
3144120	3145120	It's still a great game.
3145120	3147120	It's still yeah I like I love the game.
3147120	3150120	I just personally didn't love it in VR.
3150120	3152120	But some of you are going to and that's great.
3152120	3154120	Or have you gotten your you haven't gotten your 4K TV yet.
3154120	3156120	No I still don't.
3156120	3157120	I bet it looked good in that.
3157120	3160120	That's on my list of things I want for the holidays but we'll see.
3160120	3161120	Bring your PlayStation over.
3161120	3162120	Yeah right.
3162120	3164120	Because I believe ours is a 4K TV.
3164120	3165120	Yeah.
3165120	3169120	So Miltonius Games says should I start over from the start.
3169120	3170120	That's what I did.
3170120	3172120	And honestly the nice thing about the 2.0 update.
3172120	3178120	They had already in a previous update made the questing and like they gave you more like things to do.
3178120	3181120	So instead you're not just lost like what the fuck do I do.
3181120	3189120	They really expanded that in 2.0 so that you have like a lot of like quests that really handhold you through the basic mechanics of the game.
3189120	3191120	I think it's worth starting over just to see that.
3191120	3206120	And like get taught how to build things like the mine processor thing that lets you turn like ferrite dust into the magnetized ferrite or whatever it is.
3206120	3208120	Like you learn how to build those things.
3208120	3209120	You learn how to build a base.
3209120	3214120	It walks you through building a Stargate portal so you can teleport back.
3214120	3217120	Like that wasn't in the questing previously.
3217120	3219120	Like you had to figure out how to build the Stargate portal.
3219120	3221120	But this questing walked you through that.
3221120	3222120	So I thought it was really good.
3222120	3226120	So I think it's fine to start over personally.
3226120	3230120	Questbuster says if you're starting over the base changes might not be as bad.
3230120	3235120	But for someone like me that spent time building massive bases it feels like a lot of work just to get them working again.
3235120	3236120	Yeah.
3236120	3237120	True.
3237120	3239120	I mean it's really about like what works best for you.
3239120	3242120	But I started over and I don't regret it.
3242120	3244120	Also I double dipped.
3244120	3245120	I got the game on PC.
3245120	3250120	I bought it on PC so I could play with Alan and so I can do mods like Alan does mods.
3250120	3253120	So I like the game well enough that now I've bought it twice.
3253120	3259120	Now before you all haze me for not liking VR in No Man's Sky I will say this.
3259120	3264120	The other game I played this week, so Wipeout HD Collection released on PlayStation Plus.
3264120	3269120	And I had the disc at some point but I think it's just like in a shelf or something.
3269120	3272120	So I just downloaded it to have it always on my PlayStation 4.
3272120	3275120	And then I remembered oh yeah Wipeout got VR support.
3275120	3278120	And that's like PlayStation's F-Zero basically right.
3278120	3280120	So I played Wipeout in VR.
3280120	3281120	That was fun.
3281120	3282120	That was really fun.
3282120	3285120	And they changed the HUD so it's like different in VR.
3285120	3289120	And they do things with the turning to try to make you not so like motion sicky.
3289120	3291120	But I don't mind like the fluid stuff.
3291120	3293120	And I thought it was such a rush.
3293120	3296120	Like I really liked playing Wipeout in VR.
3296120	3301120	So you know what it works for some games that are on the TV getting translated to VR like that one.
3301120	3303120	For some games it didn't work as well for me.
3303120	3305120	But I would play Wipeout in VR again.
3305120	3306120	Hell yeah that was a lot of fun.
3306120	3312120	So Pele Hanumea in chat says NPCs get out of their ships now.
3312120	3313120	Very cool.
3313120	3314120	Yeah they do.
3314120	3321120	And there's so many more people to talk to in the bases that are out in every universe has like a base.
3321120	3322120	I don't remember what they're called.
3322120	3324120	In space there's like a space base.
3324120	3326120	Like a star base or something.
3326120	3327120	The star base or something.
3328120	3331120	They are completely different than they were in the first version of the game.
3331120	3335120	So like in the first version of the game you couldn't even go on one side of it without an Atlas pass.
3335120	3336120	No they got rid of that.
3336120	3338120	And now it's like a questing hub.
3338120	3340120	You buy new plans there.
3340120	3342120	You can talk to people and learn new words.
3342120	3343120	It's great.
3343120	3346120	Yeah Bobby says space station they'll even teach you language.
3346120	3349120	Yeah the language stones are everywhere.
3349120	3352120	And you learn like 10 new words every time you go to a base.
3352120	3353120	It's great.
3353120	3354120	So yeah.
3354120	3356120	I probably have to get back into it again.
3356120	3358120	If you own No Man's Sky just fucking try it.
3358120	3360120	I think you'll be into it.
3360120	3362120	I'm checking Steam to see if I already have it.
3362120	3363120	You might.
3363120	3365120	Okay this game whatever it is has a great name.
3365120	3366120	Electronic Super Joy.
3366120	3368120	Oh I've heard of that one.
3368120	3369120	I just like the name.
3369120	3370120	Alright anyway.
3370120	3371120	So there you go.
3371120	3372120	That was my gaming week.
3372120	3374120	So housekeeping really fast.
3374120	3375120	I've been saying it for a few weeks now.
3375120	3376120	I'm going to say it one more time.
3376120	3380120	We will not be here for the next two weeks live.
3380120	3382120	We will have a podcast next week.
3382120	3385120	And we will have a prior taped episode next week.
3385120	3388120	We're going to be doing that show I think on Thursday.
3388120	3390120	We're going to tape it.
3390120	3394120	We actually aren't going to do it live because we want there to be something that you guys can see on Sunday.
3394120	3397120	We will be fielding questions via social media.
3397120	3400120	So if you have something you've always like wanted us to talk about on the show.
3400120	3404120	Keep an eye out on our Twitter channel at Twitter.com slash OLR.
3404120	3405120	I own it.
3405120	3407120	You own No Man's Sky?
3407120	3408120	You should check it out.
3408120	3409120	I think.
3409120	3412120	Oh you know the other big thing they changed dark soccer that you'd probably be into.
3412120	3414120	In the very first version of the game you had to play first person.
3414120	3415120	Nope.
3415120	3416120	Now the default is over the shoulder.
3416120	3417120	So.
3417120	3418120	Ha-le-lu.
3418120	3419120	Yeah.
3419120	3420120	So I think you'll be into it.
3420120	3421120	Give it a shot.
3421120	3423120	Does it work on Mac?
3423120	3424120	I don't know if it works on Mac.
3424120	3428120	No I'm double checking because it's like install now and I'm like.
3428120	3430120	That would be great if it does.
3430120	3431120	I don't know.
3431120	3432120	Let's see.
3432120	3433120	Anyway.
3433120	3436120	So yeah we will not be here live for the next two weeks.
3436120	3438120	Bobby Black Wolf will be here next week.
3438120	3442120	We will not be live but we will have a new episode for you guys.
3442120	3444120	That Bobby will push the play button on.
3444120	3448120	So that you guys can see that new episode after he's all done next week.
3448120	3450120	So be tuned for that.
3450120	3452120	And then of course our podcast folks will be able to hear that.
3452120	3455120	This is because I'm leaving town early for Dragon Con this year.
3455120	3459120	I'm flying out a week from yesterday so in just six days I'm going to be leaving.
3459120	3462120	And then Dragon Con is Labor Day weekend.
3462120	3464120	So as has been the case for the past seven years.
3464120	3468120	We won't be here Labor Day weekend because I will be away at Dragon Con.
3468120	3471120	And I'm sure Dark Sakura and Loki will find something else to do Labor Day weekend.
3471120	3473120	Be it laser tag all day every day.
3473120	3475120	Or whatever else goes on.
3475120	3479120	If there's anybody there because I literally the question I ask them.
3479120	3481120	Is this place ever busy?
3481120	3484120	They're like well it's because kids are back in school.
3484120	3488120	I'm like no I don't think that's the case.
3488120	3491120	It's Labor Day weekend which is almost always your anniversary right around that time.
3491120	3493120	I should see if I can actually get the day off at work.
3493120	3496120	Yeah you guys usually go off and do something for your anniversary so it kind of works out.
3496120	3501120	If you will be at Dragon Con in Atlanta on Labor Day weekend.
3501120	3503120	Check out our Discord server.
3503120	3505120	vognetwork.com slash Discord.
3505120	3507120	vognetwork.com slash Discord.
3507120	3510120	Where we will be posting updates even if you can't be there live.
3510120	3512120	We'll be posting updates.
3512120	3514120	I'm going to be on six different panels.
3514120	3516120	Bobby Blackwell is going to be on seven.
3516120	3521120	Some of the VoG personalities past and present are going to be there at the show.
3521120	3522120	We're going to have a great time.
3522120	3526120	I'm hoping we'll have some type of content on Twitch so stay tuned to social media.
3526120	3533120	But at the end of the day we will be hosting the Dragon Con digital media track all weekend long.
3533120	3534120	So there will be something to see.
3534120	3536120	So we're going to have a great time at Dragon Con.
3536120	3538120	I hope to see some of you guys there.
3538120	3542120	So we will be back live on September 8th.
3542120	3544120	So that is basically three weeks from tonight.
3544120	3546120	So anyway.
3547120	3551120	Miltonius Games says, going to my first big con this year, BlizzCon.
3551120	3553120	BlizzCon was a good time.
3553120	3557120	My first BlizzCon and my only BlizzCon to date was the year they announced Overwatch.
3557120	3559120	So you can imagine what a big deal that was.
3559120	3565120	And you know, I think BlizzCon is going to be good this year because of last year kind of flopping.
3565120	3569120	Like with the whole Diablo is a mobile thing that like they didn't have a great year last year, right?
3569120	3574120	I think Blizzard knows they've got to like blow our fucking minds this year and I think they will.
3574120	3581120	I think Diablo 4 is going to be teased this year and probably a second or Overwatch expansion type of thing.
3581120	3586120	But yeah, god, that's going to sneak up on us before too long too is BlizzCon.
3586120	3590120	Nifty805 says, shout out that Twitch channel we can catch your panels on.
3590120	3592120	Thank you Bobby for linking that.
3592120	3596120	DC Digital Media, that's DC for Dragon Con Digital Media.
3596120	3599120	And we'll be hosting it here at VOG Network the whole weekend.
3599120	3604120	So I mean, if you forget and you're just here at VOG Network, you'll get taken to the right place anyway.
3604120	3610120	Because we have a lot of friends and fam there that we enjoy working with very much.
3610120	3614120	Alright, now we can get into some more gaming news. Let's do it.
3614120	3616120	Loki, starting us off with the downer.
3616120	3617120	Alright.
3617120	3619120	Something I've been begging for on this show for years.
3619120	3626120	We've been asking for it and you know, never really had an ETA of when they were going to do it.
3627120	3629120	And now that ETA is never.
3629120	3638120	Because apparently the long promised Minecraft Super Duper Graphics Pack is never going to happen because of technical difficulties.
3638120	3646120	So they had posted, you know, hey, some of you might remember us announcing the Super Duper Graphics Pack during E3 2017.
3646120	3651120	Super Duper was an ambitious initiative that brought a new look to Minecraft.
3652120	3658120	But unfortunately, the pack proved too technically demanding to implement as planned.
3658120	3661120	But it was bullshit.
3661120	3664120	I don't, I don't understand. Okay.
3664120	3671120	Look, I understand I don't develop games and I don't realize all the horsey power these things take to run.
3671120	3677120	But you can get 4K in other games like No Man's Sky or what have you to work just fine.
3677120	3682120	But fucking Minecraft like gets killed under pressure.
3682120	3691120	I don't know. Is it because now now to be fair, is it because Minecraft has to draw and generate so far out that it's like basically building the world as you're exploring it.
3691120	3694120	That maybe it kind of was killing the game.
3694120	3698120	I don't I don't know. It's just so weird to me that they couldn't get it to work.
3698120	3699120	Like, why not?
3699120	3702120	But I don't know why.
3702120	3711120	Maybe it's just how it's engineered on consoles and stuff like that, because they have to have it work across, you know, all of the different platforms.
3711120	3720120	But if you watch your 4K and Ultra HD and high res ray tracing and shit like that, the Java version is for you because they already have the mods or just go to the modding community.
3720120	3728120	Exactly. Because they already have, you know, Sonic Ether has already put together his, you know, unbelievably awesome graphics back.
3728120	3735120	Bobby Black Wolf in chat, kind of kind of bringing light to what we were saying here by saying the code base underneath is pretty unoptimized.
3735120	3739120	They're modifying 10 plus year old code code.
3739120	3743120	The modding community doesn't need to pass QA or console certifications.
3743120	3748120	That's why they can mod in 4K. And I will give you that like them. Oh, my God. Hold on cat somewhere.
3748120	3757120	He shouldn't be. Well, honestly, that does make a super lot of sense just for that purpose.
3757120	3762120	I was thinking that maybe it even had to do with something the way that it worked with their servers or something.
3762120	3768120	I mean, why possibility? Why announce something, though, if you have no idea if it's going to work or not?
3768120	3772120	Like, I don't understand what the point of announcing like, oh, hey, we've got this brand new pack.
3772120	3776120	If they see like modders doing they're like, well, we think we can do that. Seems easy enough.
3776120	3782120	They must have had an idea that it would work. How how did we have screenshots and stuff like that and video of it?
3782120	3786120	I'm assuming they just recorded a very low frame rate and played back faster or something like that.
3786120	3791120	But I mean, everything works differently on a testing machine than it does in production.
3791120	3800120	So like I get it if it can't come out on all platforms, but maybe just Xbox one X and PlayStation 4 Pro or whatever the case may be.
3800120	3805120	I think that it would be a better sign that they were going to do it for one. They did it for all.
3805120	3812120	But I don't play universally on the systems like in like the same seated universes and whatnot.
3812120	3819120	It's it's well, a lot of the lighting is already kind of baked in there and the updates when they do update blocks and stuff.
3819120	3822120	And I don't know if this would change the way that they did it. I don't know.
3822120	3827120	I still wish that they had an option to be able to do that and have it a little bit nicer.
3827120	3833120	But it is disappointing that they make this big announcement and then say, oops, our bad.
3834120	3840120	We can't do it because I mean, try to suck less or like even like just the 4K textures.
3840120	3844120	Can we just get 4K textures without maybe the overhaul to the lighting?
3844120	3847120	Like, can we meet can we meet halfway on this?
3847120	3861120	So we're like, I kind of have a theory that if they might come back and say, here's our apology in a texture packs or we can't do it in Minecraft.
3861120	3867120	But here's my craft, too, with, you know, 4K textures and enhanced lighting.
3867120	3871120	And oh, my God, all the things that we couldn't do before.
3871120	3874120	Yeah, I was just here before I got distracted by Mr. Smoosh.
3874120	3880120	I was going to say that it's probably that like I think what Bobby's saying about the really old code.
3880120	3883120	You have to remember Minecraft was developed by one dude.
3883120	3889120	So I can in the beginning and so I can remember or I can I can kind of give him credit that like,
3889120	3896120	you know, the code base that they're having to modify is so old and having to run on all these different platforms that it probably just proved to be too difficult or basically.
3896120	3898120	That never stopped Bethesda, though.
3898120	3901120	Isn't that the truth? Isn't that the truth?
3901120	3909120	So but I could see that maybe they're going to end up doing like a Minecraft two or something like that, where it'll have all those bells and whistles.
3909120	3911120	And yeah, we'll see.
3911120	3912120	Yeah.
3912120	3913120	All right.
3913120	3917120	Anyway, moving on to games that we know are actually happening online.
3918120	3923120	Well, OK, a quick comment from Bobby, because I think this is a fair question to ask.
3923120	3930120	Yes, but aren't you happy that Microsoft decided to kill it rather than have it be out with all the Bethesda bugs?
3930120	3935120	Yes, I am fine with them killing it, but I don't know.
3935120	3943120	I don't know why showcase some update like that without like first seeing that you can get it to run correctly.
3943120	3950120	Like, I understand that development takes time, but like, why announce something like that so early if you can't actually get it to work?
3950120	3951120	I don't know.
3951120	3954120	Maybe with all the future updates that they did that it complicated things.
3954120	3963120	But it just seems like it's silly thing to, you know, promise without actually being able to know if you can fulfill that promise.
3963120	3964120	Yeah.
3964120	3965120	All right.
3965120	3970120	Anyway, moving on to other stories, let's talk about a brand new need for speed game.
3970120	3975120	So we had a little bit of a rumor last week leading into Gamescom that there was going to be a new need for speed game.
3975120	3977120	And as it turns out, yes, it's happening.
3977120	3979120	It's called Need for Speed Heat.
3979120	3982120	It's going to be out on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
3982120	3984120	It's being developed by Ghost Games.
3984120	3987120	And of course, there's a lot of little marketing going about it.
3987120	3990120	It's kind of got like a like an 80s neon.
3990120	3991120	What was that game?
3991120	3995120	Miami Hotline Miami kind of look to it kind of going on with it.
3995120	3996120	Vice City.
3996120	3997120	Yeah, that whole thing.
3997120	4004120	So anyway, Need for Speed Heat is being developed by Ghost Games, who has done some prior Need for Speed titles.
4004120	4005120	And that'll be good.
4005120	4010120	If you get a preorder in, you can get things like a brand new BMW i8 coupe in the game.
4010120	4012120	Not actually in real life.
4012120	4019120	Mercedes coupe, Chevrolet Corvette Grand Sport, some cosmetics and so forth.
4019120	4023120	I thought you said BMX for a moment, but you said BMW.
4023120	4024120	Yeah.
4024120	4026120	Unfortunately, you're not going to win any races.
4026120	4027120	Way hardcore for the 80s theme there.
4027120	4028120	Yeah.
4028120	4031120	Hey, it looks like they're bringing back BMX triple X as well.
4031120	4032120	Who knew? No, just kidding.
4032120	4033120	All right.
4033120	4034120	Yes.
4034120	4037120	Need for Speed Heat will be out on November 8th.
4037120	4041120	But since EA loves to put their games out early so the internet can tear them down.
4041120	4045120	EA Access and Origin Access will be able to play it on November 5th.
4045120	4048120	And I think EA needs to stop doing this stuff.
4048120	4050120	But maybe the game will be that.
4050120	4053120	But EA likes money too much so they don't have sensibilities.
4053120	4055120	Maybe the game will be that good.
4055120	4058120	Well, tell that to the sales figures for Mass Effect Andromeda.
4058120	4061120	Maybe the game will be that good that they won't have to worry about it.
4061120	4062120	Let's hope.
4062120	4064120	I like the Need for Speed franchise, so who knows?
4064120	4072120	Also, community manager for EA Ben Walk had a Q&A on the subreddit for Need for Speed to answer some questions.
4072120	4075120	And there are not going to be surprise mechanics, according to the Q&A.
4076120	4083120	In a chat here, coming into the reveal, one of the things we agreed we would detail is the monetization options.
4083120	4086120	No loot boxes, car packs, etc.
4086120	4087120	No scapegoat here.
4087120	4091120	We plan to have post-launch paid DLC in the form of car packs.
4091120	4097120	Later this year, we'll introduce a time safe pack, which will show all collectibles on the map.
4097120	4101120	So it sounds like they're kind of going that Forza Horizon route, which has some of that stuff.
4101120	4103120	But there is not going to be loot boxes.
4103120	4105120	At least not at the start.
4107120	4108120	They can do other things.
4108120	4119120	They can introduce a similar system that Fortnite has, where they do seasons with different DLC and make it so that it's timed exclusive type stuff.
4119120	4121120	There's ways.
4122120	4123120	Yeah.
4123120	4131120	So Darktosea in chat over at Twitch TV slash VOG Network says, yeah, they say no loot boxes or microtransactions, but that remains to be seen.
4131120	4137120	Hopefully they don't pull an Activision and shoehorn them in six months later, after all the reviews are all out.
4137120	4142120	And Renji221 adding to that, until the review is like the Crash Team Racing.
4142120	4144120	Yeah, that's shady, shady.
4144120	4146120	So hopefully we won't see that happen again.
4147120	4148120	All right.
4148120	4150120	Let's move on to Dark Sakura for our next story.
4150120	4151120	This is pretty happy.
4152120	4156120	Well, a Nintendo console is outselling everybody else.
4156120	4158120	Yep, it is the Switch.
4158120	4164120	It is outselling the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 4.
4164120	4173120	It has, of the 10 best selling games between July 7th and August 3rd, six of them were exclusive to the Switch.
4174120	4193120	And it actually is continuing to be the best selling console of the year, which is right now leading, well, over last year, especially since they have the new, cheaper version of the Switch coming out that's portable only.
4194120	4206120	But right now, since Microsoft and Sony both had a really slow year, Nintendo's really picked up with everything that's come out, you know, since I'd say like mid last year.
4206120	4213120	It's the best selling console of, you know, from July 7th to August 3rd, so I'll say July.
4214120	4223120	Their Switch Pro Controller outsold the PlayStation 4's controllers, even though the PlayStation 4 controller is still the best selling controller.
4223120	4228120	And then, of course, we have the new launch of September 20th. It's going to have the portable.
4229120	4233120	Just speaking really quick about those PlayStation 4 controllers, though, they announced some new colors this week.
4233120	4236120	There's a purple one that's so good looking. I want it so bad.
4237120	4239120	Is it sparkly and diamond-y?
4239120	4245120	No, it's like an electric, I think they call it electric purple, but they also are coming out with rose gold if you want one to match your iPhone.
4246120	4247120	My iPhone's not rose gold.
4247120	4248120	That's a thing you're into?
4249120	4256120	No, that's stupid. And then again, how many Wii controllers, not Wii, but GameCube controllers do I have?
4257120	4265120	So, but you know, we've also got, Fire Emblem Three Houses came out on July 26th. It was the second best selling game of the month.
4266120	4279120	Super Mario Maker 2 was the third spot of the month, and Marvel Ultimate Alliance 3, the Black Order, was considered the fourth best selling game after their launch.
4280120	4290120	So, in July 2019, just going in order for what was the best sellers, at 10 we have Breath of the Wild, at 9 we have Mario Kart 8.
4291120	4296120	8 was Mortal Kombat 11, which is Nintendo, but 7 is Super Smash Brothers Ultimate.
4297120	4303120	Moving back up for Nintendo, we have Marvel Ultimate Alliance 3 at number 4, Super Mario Maker 2 at number 3.
4304120	4311120	We have Fire Emblem, of course now the number one selling game was Madden NFL 20, because what the fuck ever.
4312120	4313120	People like their damn sports games.
4314120	4317120	So that was it. Nintendo's doing pretty good for themselves right now.
4317120	4324120	Yeah, but to be fair, I mean, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One are both kind of like, we know they're in their sunsetting phases.
4325120	4330120	Like, we know in a year we're going to have new, you know, PlayStation 5 and whatever Scorpio ends up being.
4331120	4335120	So, I mean Switch is still kind of a newer kid on the block. It's only a couple years old at this point.
4336120	4340120	So, it just kind of feels like maybe, like now is just the time that a lot of people are buying a Switch as well.
4340120	4346120	Because, you know, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, probably a lot of those are being sold second hand at this point.
4347120	4352120	And it's just, you know, it's just kind of on its way out. They're going to the ranch to retire.
4353120	4357120	No, I'm not taking the thunder out of it, but I think there is a sense of reality.
4358120	4363120	Well, I think it's more like the opposite. It's more like, I don't think this is a sign that like, oh no, Sony and Microsoft are in trouble.
4363120	4364120	No, this is just...
4365120	4370120	And a lot of people are holding off now too because they know that new systems are coming next year probably.
4371120	4372120	So, it's like...
4373120	4376120	The Switch is going to have all the hot stuff. The things that people are really the most excited about Nintendo doing.
4377120	4379120	We're going to have another Animal Crossing. Well, maybe that's me.
4380120	4382120	But, I'm in a lot of Animal Crossing communities, dammit.
4383120	4384120	You're not alone. You're not alone.
4385120	4392120	Yeah. But, I mean, there's just a whole lot that's on Nintendo's horizon right now that people are, you know, getting prepared for.
4393120	4405120	Gosh, like in just in the Animal Crossing community alone, they've been at least like a dozen posts that says, hey, I just bought a Switch because this is coming out and I want to play this and I want to play that.
4406120	4409120	So, you know, I was going to buy mine until I won one.
4410120	4415120	Well, and I think there's probably just a lot of those same people probably already bought a PlayStation 4 five years ago.
4416120	4420120	You know, those things have been out for a while. So, I think people are just kind of like, oh, in this lull, now's the time to get a Switch.
4420120	4428120	I think that's really all it is. I just don't think Nintendo's success is necessarily Sony or Microsoft's like, you know, anything necessarily bad news.
4429120	4434120	And probably next year, PlayStation 5 will be in a really good position compared to the Switch.
4435120	4439120	But, maybe not. I mean, because Nintendo's got a lot of inertia right now. They've got some fucking great games.
4440120	4448120	Maybe next holiday, here comes Breath of the Wild 2 to keep it really competitive with what's going on with, you know, Sony and Microsoft.
4448120	4451120	It could be a very interesting holiday next year. So, we'll see.
4452120	4460120	Act F says I got the name wrong. It's Project Scarlett, not Scorpio. Sorry, so many project names. I get them all mixed up. But, yes, thank you. It was Scarlett.
4461120	4463120	Does it want to do blood magic?
4464120	4469120	Let's see. Miltonius Games says Fire Emblem Three Houses is so good. I've only played one prior.
4470120	4476120	Yeah, I'm hearing a lot of love for the new Fire Emblem games. So, I don't usually get into the tactical games as much, so I kind of skipped it.
4476120	4478120	Yeah, I might tell the other ones.
4479120	4483120	Yeah, I mean, maybe when a sale happens. I don't know if I can get it right away.
4484120	4490120	I'm not a tactics fan at all, and I've played a bunch of tactics games. I'll put it this way, I don't even care for Final Fantasy tactics.
4491120	4498120	See, I sit here and I say, I don't really care for tactics games, but Final Fantasy tactics? Oh, fuck, I'm there. I am there. Like, easy.
4498120	4507120	It's like, one of the tactics games that I thought I was really going to enjoy was the Macross game that came out on PC Engine, and I couldn't get into it either.
4508120	4512120	So, even if I am a big fan of the characters in the series, I can't get into it.
4513120	4517120	Yeah. Alright, well, let's move on. Loki, what do you have next for us?
4518120	4525120	Alright, so this is exciting. So, there's lots of announcements coming from THQ Nordic because of, I think, their investment report that they had put out.
4525120	4530120	So, they had some updates on some games that we haven't really heard much about lately.
4531120	4535120	So, for example, they talked a little bit about Dead Island 2 and TimeSplitters.
4536120	4544120	So, Dead Island 2 is apparently being developed now by Dambuster Studios, who worked on Homefront The Revolution.
4545120	4552120	And also, apparently, that one of the creators of TimeSplitters will return to help work on that series as well.
4552120	4561120	They also announced, to my delight, that Volition is deep in development on a brand new Saints Row game.
4562120	4563120	I bet you are excited about that.
4564120	4565120	I am very excited about that.
4566120	4567120	I'm excited about that.
4568120	4573120	Please don't suck, but I will still buy it anyway, as long as it's not, like, the last fucking game that they released.
4574120	4575120	Angels of Mayhem?
4576120	4577120	Yes, I'm not buying that crap.
4578120	4579120	Wasn't Angels of Mayhem just another game they built on the old Saints Row engine?
4579120	4586120	It was supposed to be a new thing that they were going to release, and then they kept tying it in with Saints Row.
4587120	4589120	Then it sort of became part of, like, Saints Row's universe a little bit.
4590120	4593120	And it's like they kind of leaned too much on Saints Row instead of making it its own thing.
4594120	4595120	And it just wasn't very good.
4596120	4600120	And then, of course, along with that, they also announced some more acquisitions.
4601120	4602120	So, different companies they have purchased now.
4602120	4609120	So, they purchased a studio called Milestone SRL, which was formerly known as Graffiti.
4610120	4616120	And they're best known for, I guess, some different motocross and superbike games, as well as the WRC series.
4617120	4630120	And then, of course, along with Milestone, they had, let's see, Gunfire Games, who worked on the Darksider series.
4631120	4638120	And so, they have been, I guess, working on the Darksiders II remaster, as well as Darksiders III.
4638120	4647120	And then, finally, Goodbye Kansas Game Invest is an investment company that they have purchased as well.
4648120	4660120	And also looking to pick up some other studios, Palindrome Interactive, Fall Damage, Neon Giant, Cavallari, and Frame Bunker.
4662120	4663120	I'm not really sure who those are.
4664120	4665120	But, yeah, lots of different game studios.
4666120	4669120	All right, yeah. I was going to say, I think the one that did the motocross development.
4670120	4676120	Remember that one E3 we actually had time with THQ, well, they weren't THQ Nordic then, they were just Nordic Entertainment.
4677120	4678120	And they were showing us a motocross game.
4679120	4680120	Yeah, maybe MX.
4681120	4682120	Yeah, they have a big franchise.
4683120	4687120	So, I think if they weren't working with the studio before already on that, which they probably were, I forget who developed it.
4688120	4689120	It was a few years ago. So, I kind of forget who built that.
4689120	4694120	THQ, I think, worked with SBK, MotoGP, WRC. WRC was Nordic.
4695120	4701120	So, I mean, it logically makes sense because motocross is probably one of their constant sellers.
4702120	4708120	It's one of those yearly releases that probably sells well enough to keep doing the development.
4709120	4715120	All right, moving on to talking about something that's a little bit of a rumor, but there's some fact in it.
4715120	4723120	Because there has been an FCC filing for a brand new Super Nintendo controller that looks like it's designed for the Switch.
4724120	4729120	So, there's FCC filing that shows a Super Nintendo shaped controller.
4730120	4737120	It looks like it will actually slide into the Joy-Con slots on the side of the Switch unit, which the NES controllers do too, if I remember right.
4738120	4739120	You can actually pop those on the sides.
4739120	4746120	So, it looks almost certain that Super Nintendo games are inbound for Nintendo Switch Online pretty soon.
4747120	4749120	We are coming up on the year anniversary.
4750120	4761120	I remember Dark Tetsuya was pointing out that the August games are coming out later this month than they usually do to kind of maybe push the release schedule back into later in the month, which would tie right into...
4762120	4766120	I got a... Mr. Smoosh is on a destruction spree today, I swear to God.
4767120	4768120	I'll get him.
4769120	4770120	Okay, that's fine.
4771120	4772120	I'm just going to detract him for a minute.
4773120	4774120	Okay, that's fine.
4775120	4785120	So, where was I? Oh yes, I just got a reminder email that was like, reminder, your Nintendo Online subscription is about to renew in September of 2020, because I got that free...
4786120	4787120	The Twitch thing, yeah.
4788120	4794120	Yeah, I got that free year with the Twitch thing, but I imagine most people are expiring at the end of September, but if they hear that, oh, now I can get Super Nintendo games, they're probably going to stick with it.
4794120	4804120	I mean, it's alright, I guess, but like, I don't know, they could do so much more. It's just like the bare minimum that they're pushing out.
4805120	4810120	Don't get me wrong, I'd love to see them do more as well, but Super Nintendo games, it's going to get some attention.
4811120	4816120	And I'm worried with the Super Nintendo games coming out, does that mean that the NES games are going to start, they're going to pull that back?
4817120	4820120	Almost certainly. Almost certainly.
4820120	4827120	Well, okay, what first party Nintendo games are not out at this point on that service?
4828120	4830120	Aside from really terrible ones like Pinball and stuff like that?
4831120	4839120	Yeah, aside from their kind of stuff they keep shoveling out, like Wrecking Crew and Clu Clu Land and things like that from the original launch series.
4840120	4841120	Not much.
4841120	4853120	Yeah, not much. So I think Nintendo might be running into some problem with trying to get licensing agreements for third party games, especially when companies are just bundling the games and doing their own thing.
4854120	4861120	Like the Mega Man collection, or the Mana collection, or they're just repackaging them in different places.
4862120	4869120	So I think that's why Nintendo probably feels the need to do Super Nintendo now, which will keep them going for a little while.
4869120	4871120	Do you think we'll see Star Fox 2 on there as well?
4872120	4878120	Absolutely, why not? Why not? We'll see Star Fox 2 Earthbound I think will actually happen, why not?
4879120	4885120	We'll see things like, we're not going to see them all right away, but that's going to be their trajectory for the next year for Super Nintendo.
4886120	4888120	Yeah, we'll see.
4889120	4896120	Bobby Blackwolf says, you can't get Star Fox 2 any other way now, so it makes sense. Yeah, because the Super Nintendo classics are gone, right?
4897120	4899120	They're gone, they don't make them anymore, right?
4900120	4905120	S21 Hunter Matt putting his tinfoil hat on saying, they will announce Super Nintendo games coming to Nintendo Online.
4906120	4914120	At the same time, they will announce Geno as the last Smash DLC fighter, as well as Super Mario RPG coming to the service first.
4914120	4924120	There's a lot of fan hope in that, but that would be a great kind of, you know, synergy for promoting everything. That'd be great.
4925120	4930120	We'll see though. Don't set the expectations too high. That's the one problem.
4931120	4939120	D'Artezia points out Castlevania and Contra with those collections. So again, why didn't we get Castlevania II Simon's Quest on the NES Online service?
4940120	4941120	Because they wanted a good one?
4941120	4952120	Wow. No, we did get Castlevania I, you're right, but that was in the very beginning, right? And then I think Konami just kind of realized, oh, we could make people buy them and they would.
4953120	4955120	That's why you never got Castlevania II or III or any of the other stuff.
4956120	4958120	We should get Fester's Quest.
4959120	4960120	Fuck yeah, we should get Fester's Quest.
4961120	4964120	Fester's Quest is Blaster Master II. I mean...
4965120	4966120	Basically.
4967120	4969120	Basically. I know that game gets a lot of shit because that's a weird thing.
4969120	4975120	And there's a severe lack, there's a severe lack of the Guardian Legend in there as well.
4976120	4982120	This is so fucking true, but unfortunately the rights to that game are so complicated I don't expect Nintendo to be able to solve them.
4983120	4990120	But I would be so happy. I might actually cry if the Guardian Legend were to come out on the Nintendo Online service, but I just don't see it happening.
4991120	4993120	It just still broke my heart. They had to cancel that fan remake.
4993120	4999120	I know. Well, if somebody's shutting things down for rights, who knows?
5000120	5005120	That's why you make a fan remake, release it, then tell people about it, and it's too late.
5006120	5007120	Yeah. Alright.
5008120	5010120	Wasn't that kind of what happened with one of those Metroid ones?
5011120	5017120	Yeah, you're right. It was the M2R or whatever it was called. They shut that down and then it was like the next day was...
5018120	5024120	Not next day, but it was within a week or two was the... Oh, guess what's coming... Guess what the last big 3DS game's gonna be?
5025120	5031120	Oh wait, no, because Luigi's Mansion technically is... But one of the last big ones is gonna be the Metroid II remake, which turned out really good.
5032120	5033120	It was a nice little pleasant surprise.
5034120	5037120	Alright, let's move on. Dark Sakura, you have another Nintendo-related thing for us, right?
5037120	5051120	Well, Nintendo has put out a few tweets with some little bit of details, but they tweeted that for tomorrow for us, Monday, August 19, at 6 a.m. Pacific,
5052120	5054120	guess who won't be awake? Me!
5055120	5066120	are going to be doing a livestream for their Indie World video showcase with about 20 minutes of indie game information for the Switch.
5067120	5078120	So, I think that's gonna be pretty cool. I mean, I hope that it's not just the usual indie games that they give like maybe a publishing sort of thing too,
5079120	5088120	you know, to get, you know, new games out there other than just the successful, quote fingers, where are they? Successful games.
5089120	5093120	But it would be nice to see, you know, what they're gonna do.
5093120	5099120	Well, there's a rumor out there, so I'll just put it out there, and this is totally not what you're asking.
5100120	5101120	Fleetwood Mac.
5102120	5108120	This is not what you're asking for, Dark Sakura. It's the exact opposite, but the rumor, okay, is that, and I don't even remember where this was found,
5109120	5118120	but somebody was telling it to me, and I'm sure you guys have seen it out there on blogs and stuff, that Ori and the Blind Forest is going to have a surprise reveal as part of this for Nintendo Switch.
5118120	5125120	Yeah, I mean, it's a great game, but everybody's gonna be gagged because it's a Microsoft studio. It's one of their indie studios,
5126120	5134120	and it would be like, oh my god, Microsoft is putting games out on a Nintendo platform when they've done it before with Viva Pinata on the regular DS, right?
5135120	5136120	Yeah, the regular DS.
5137120	5139120	So, it wouldn't really be the first time, but okay.
5140120	5141120	The Halo Master Chief collection.
5142120	5145120	The only Halo game I would play if they did Halo Master Chef.
5145120	5149120	Well, you know, was she here when the new Cookie Momma game came out?
5150120	5151120	Oh yeah, the new Cookie Momma game came out this year.
5152120	5153120	And she does vegan cuisine.
5154120	5155120	Yeah, she will now do vegan cuisine.
5156120	5158120	Okay, PETA. Fucking PETA.
5159120	5160120	It's an option.
5161120	5163120	It's just an option. You can still have your meat filled dishes if you want.
5164120	5167120	Dark Sakura likes her Impossible Burger. Why? Because they still bleed.
5167120	5175120	They do. Actually, no, I'm gonna go ahead on record. The Beyond Burger and the Impossible Burger are both delicious, especially with cheese.
5176120	5177120	Because I'm ruining vegan food.
5178120	5179120	It's fine.
5180120	5181120	It actually is really delicious.
5182120	5183120	The fact that they exist has already ruined vegan food.
5184120	5192120	Good point. Dark Tetsuya says, well, they were saying the same thing about Cuphead, and that happened, so anything's possible. That's right. Cuphead was a Microsoft.
5193120	5194120	I picked up a Cuphead figure at Target.
5194120	5197120	Yeah, so why not? Why not Ori and the Blind Forest? It's a great game.
5198120	5207120	Yeah. The Switch would be better off with it. And it ends up being promo. See, what they do, they put Ori and the Blind Forest in to get all the Nintendo fans hyped.
5208120	5216120	And then, oh, did you like that game? Well, we have a sequel out right now, and even if you don't have an Xbox One, you can get it on Xbox Game Pass PC.
5217120	5218120	Wink wink.
5219120	5223120	Microsoft. I'm telling you. I'm telling you. They know what they're doing at Microsoft now.
5224120	5225120	Far better than they did five years ago.
5226120	5227120	This is Modern Warfare.
5228120	5231120	This is. This is Call of Microsoft Modern Warfare. This is what it is.
5232120	5245120	Well, no. I mean, like, even, like, in real life, Warfare is fought with negotiations behind the scenes and turning Group A against Group B and promoting Group C to do Group D's work.
5246120	5251120	Oh, turning people against each other? I just did that for 51 days. I know all about that.
5251120	5261120	All right. PixelPakas in chat says you missed the weirdest thing about that new Cookie Mama game. It's going to use blockchain technology.
5262120	5263120	What? Why?
5264120	5271120	You know why we missed it? Because nobody fucking cares. No, I agree it's weird, PixelPakas. That's not a read on you. You know that.
5272120	5278120	But it's like one of those, like, why? Where's that Jackie Chan meme? Like, why?
5281120	5286120	Ryan Reynolds went, but why?
5287120	5293120	For the record, before we get to the next segment, I do believe that y'all should try some of my delicious challah.
5294120	5296120	I will. Can we do it during the break so we stop derailing the show?
5297120	5299120	No. All right. You can eat it during my segment.
5300120	5304120	All right. Moving on. Let's get to. We're only two stories away from that classic game.
5305120	5307120	We are. All right. Loki.
5307120	5319120	All right. So Steam Workshop now is requiring that different content that is put through there must now go through an approval process.
5320120	5328120	So you can't just throw up user content now. It has to go through a process where they can approve or deny the submission.
5329120	5333120	I'm guessing because a lot of copyright material ends up going through there or maybe like scam stuff or who knows.
5334120	5335120	Or bullshit.
5335120	5349120	Apparently, though, there has been issues where CSGO stuff, for example, they've had several like things where actual content or user maps or whatever would be constantly pushed off the front page.
5350120	5354120	And they're replacing being replaced with like ads for free weapons skins or something like that.
5355120	5358120	So it's like people are putting content in there as advertisements for things.
5358120	5365120	And so it's just kind of like the content we put up there for Typing of the Dead. That's basically a big advertisement for O.L.R..
5366120	5374120	Well, that's different. That's that's like saying, you know, instead of putting actual content in there, it's like saying, hey, come listen to O.L.R..
5375120	5378120	You know, come go to this website and listen to instead of actually being any content, it's just garbage.
5379120	5382120	We actually put content on there because it was really easy to do.
5382120	5394120	And if you didn't know, if you're a newer listener of O.L.R., this is what for episode 700 or 600, one of those one of our big anniversary shows, we actually put a Typing of the Dead expansion pack with O.L.R. in jokes.
5395120	5398120	It's a real thing. It's on the Steam Workshop thing. If you go to the page Typing of the Dead, we're there.
5399120	5403120	We're in the top 10, too. I think I don't think there's a whole lot of that. I mean, it's pretty easy to put out a typing pack.
5404120	5410120	But yeah, we're because we had a bunch of people download it when it was first out. I think we're still there. So fun.
5412120	5420120	All right. By the way, did you know the the block chain and Cooking Mama? Bobby points out they're using the block chain to allow you to be able to resell the digital game.
5421120	5427120	That's it's DRM. That's why the block chain is there. And PixelPaka is following that up saying, but is Cooking Mama the game to do that with?
5428120	5429120	It's just a very random choice, it seems.
5430120	5433120	So is it only going to be a digital game? I don't understand what the point of that is.
5434120	5436120	Maybe on PC. Maybe we're talking about like Steam and that type of thing.
5436120	5441120	It is a little weird. If it's to open up a resale market on PC, I will raise an eyebrow with it.
5442120	5448120	And I can also understand that maybe they want to test it with something like Cooking Mama because exactly that reason.
5449120	5453120	It's not the game you would expect it with. And it's going to be a smaller test thing.
5454120	5460120	Kind of like when you release Harry Potter, Wizards Unite in New Zealand first.
5460120	5466120	Because of course there's a lot of people in New Zealand, but are there comparatively as many people in New Zealand as there are the rest of the world?
5467120	5469120	No, it's a nice little test market, right?
5470120	5475120	So that would be the same thing with like Cooking Mama versus, you know, a new Destiny game or something like that.
5476120	5477120	So I could sort of see that.
5478120	5484120	All right. Anyway, moving on to some rumors out there about the Switch.
5485120	5488120	And this, I don't know, it's weird because there's not a consistent answer with this.
5488120	5493120	So this has to do with the new Switch models that have the longer battery life.
5494120	5498120	So you know how like Nintendo Switch was replaced not that long ago with one that has a much longer battery life in it?
5499120	5500120	Yes.
5501120	5506120	Well, some people are kind of salty about that because they just bought one of the older Switch models with the old battery life and now they kind of got screwed.
5507120	5509120	But that's what happens with technology sometimes, right?
5510120	5511120	Yes, that's true.
5511120	5518120	So, but apparently what was happening is that some people were calling in to get their Nintendo Switch exchanged and it was working.
5519120	5527120	That Nintendo was willing to exchange Nintendo Switches that were bought after July 17th with a more efficient model.
5528120	5531120	So here's the thing though, a Nintendo spokesperson denied this.
5532120	5534120	They were talking in an interview with The Verge saying,
5534120	5538120	We do not have a Nintendo Switch exchange program. That's a quote.
5539120	5546120	But apparently some people were calling Nintendo and they were sending in their old console, getting a replacement as long as they were covering the shipping and insurance costs.
5547120	5549120	And they would get the revised battery life.
5550120	5555120	But you know, it was the battery life in those newer models like twice as long. That can really make the difference for some people, right?
5556120	5560120	So yeah. So interesting and it's interesting Nintendo doesn't have a clear answer on that.
5560120	5565120	It may have been one of those things that like customer service was giving some people just as like a nice thing.
5566120	5567120	But hmm, I don't know.
5568120	5572120	Pod Culture in chat says, Probably nothing official, but if you call to complain, they will.
5573120	5575120	I wonder if it's, yeah, more along those lines.
5576120	5581120	But now that it's hit the internet and all these people are talking about it, somebody high up at Nintendo has decided to put the stop on it.
5582120	5585120	This is how you don't get your $125 class action lawsuit settlement money.
5586120	5587120	I guess, I don't know.
5587120	5592120	So anyway, as 200 Matt says, this is probably a, your experience may vary situation.
5593120	5594120	True. True.
5595120	5600120	All right. Well, let's take a trip down memory lane back when you didn't have battery life on your console.
5601120	5603120	Why? Because they were all plugged into the wall.
5604120	5605120	It's the classic game of the week.
5606120	5610120	Dark soccer is going to step into the gaming vault and find a game that she thinks, Hey, you guys should check this game out.
5611120	5612120	And actually I think you picked a game this week.
5613120	5616120	A lot of people have checked out and love, and this is why people are going to love this pick tonight.
5617120	5618120	Because the damn music was stuck in my head.
5619120	5621120	All right. So here it is. Your classic game of the week is?
5622120	5624120	Marvel vs. Capcom 2, New Age of Heroes.
5625120	5627120	Because I'm going to take you for a fucking ride.
5628120	5629120	Just play a little bit.
5630120	5631120	I don't know if y'all can hear this.
5632120	5633120	It's the best version of Marvel vs. Capcom.
5634120	5635120	It's quiet, but they can hear it.
5636120	5637120	Yeah.
5638120	5639120	Especially fuck the new one.
5640120	5641120	The one before that was okay.
5641120	5647120	Yeah. I think that this one is the Dreamcast one because I love the Dreamcast and that's the version that I will play until I die.
5648120	5653120	But anyway, it is of course the sequel to Marvel vs. Capcom, which I've done before.
5654120	5659120	However, it is one of the best crossover fighting games that Capcom has done.
5660120	5665120	It has amazing characters in it, including a cactus wearing a sombrero.
5666120	5667120	Just saying.
5668120	5669120	And of course it has Strider here, which makes it awesome.
5669120	5675120	So anyway, the game came out...hold on, I've got the dates.
5676120	5681120	Well now, this says it came out in 2000.
5682120	5685120	We had...yeah.
5686120	5688120	So anyway, this game came out in 2000.
5689120	5696120	It has characters from both the Marvel universe and Capcom universes trying to save the universe and beat other people up.
5697120	5702120	It has the same tag team mechanics, a few different changes.
5703120	5709120	Now going to 3 on 3 gameplay, a character assist system, and an amplified control scheme.
5710120	5714120	And it still uses 2D animation and sprites, but the backgrounds are rendered in 3D.
5715120	5719120	So this is the first game in the franchise to use 2.5D graphics.
5720120	5724120	Anyway, I see that you're not eating Kala.
5726120	5728120	Anyway, Rob betraying me.
5729120	5730120	I forgot it was available. I'll have some now.
5731120	5733120	Eat it. Loki, you should have some too because it's amazing.
5734120	5736120	Anyway, the game was really well received.
5737120	5740120	It was really just a lot of fun.
5741120	5742120	I played a shit ton of it.
5743120	5748120	And man, I waited having to wait 10 years to get another game in the series after that.
5749120	5752120	So anyway, you have...
5752120	5758120	You have your different assists that you can use.
5759120	5763120	You have a variable assist that came from Marvel Super Heroes vs Street Fighter.
5764120	5767120	You can call one of your off-screen team members to give you an assist.
5768120	5772120	And each character has 3 different kinds of assists that you can pick with different Greek letters.
5773120	5775120	Which is Alpha, Beta, and...
5776120	5777120	Probably Gamma.
5778120	5779120	Gamma, yep. I had to think about it.
5779120	5785120	You also have your normal hyper combos, which are your very powerful attacks.
5786120	5793120	You have delayed hyper combos that allow you to do multiple hyper combos consecutively and variable combinations.
5794120	5801120	You can have the team's entire character roster for that team to use their hyper combos simultaneously.
5802120	5806120	You also have snapback, which forces your opponent to switch characters.
5806120	5812120	And it also has a modified version of the 6-button theme.
5813120	5819120	So you have a series of 4 attack buttons and 2 assist buttons,
5820120	5826120	instead of having your top row being different levels of punches and your bottom being different levels of kicks.
5829120	5831120	It had single player and multiplayer game modes.
5831120	5836120	There was of course arcade mode, where you had to beat Abyss who had different forms.
5837120	5840120	And it didn't have character specific endings.
5841120	5844120	Everyone gets the same ending in arcade mode.
5845120	5847120	And then versus mode of course is to play against each other.
5850120	5856120	Now in Marvel vs Capcom 2 in the arcade you had an experience system that allows you to unlock different hidden characters
5857120	5860120	after a certain number of experience points are earned.
5861120	5864120	And it was of course removed in the console version in favor of the secret factor,
5865120	5867120	where you could buy hidden character stage backgrounds,
5868120	5870120	color schemes that you would earn with points through normal play.
5871120	5874120	Xbox 360 and Playstation 3 versions had online multiplayer,
5875120	5877120	which had ranked matches, lobbies.
5878120	5886120	And the Japanese release of Marvel vs Capcom 2 for Dreamcast had online play through Capcom's matching service.
5887120	5891120	Although it was only limited between two different Dreamcast systems.
5892120	5895120	So it had a bunch of characters.
5896120	5898120	I am just going to read through this really quickly.
5899120	5903120	Although there were some original characters that were made for each side.
5904120	5910120	And a few different new characters or characters that hadn't been seen in games for a while.
5910120	5918120	Like for the original character we had Amingo who was the cactus and Ruby Heart the pirate who was awesome.
5919120	5926120	And we also had Son Son who was the granddaughter of the protagonist from the 1984 Capcom arcade game Son Son.
5928120	5935120	And so you start off with 24 characters and the remaining 32 characters get unlocked using your XP.
5936120	5942120	Although again in the 360 PlayStation 3 ports all characters are initially unlocked.
5943120	5946120	And this game had some of my favorite characters to use.
5947120	5948120	Of course it had Sakura in it who I would always use.
5949120	5956120	But I love to use for the Capcom side, I always of course like to use Strider Kiryu.
5957120	5959120	I love to use Jill. Jill is fun.
5959120	5961120	And Jean Saotome.
5962120	5968120	And then for the Capcom side I think that my favorites over there were using...
5969120	5972120	Okay I like Shumagrath because Shumagrath is just fun.
5973120	5974120	I loved using Psylocke.
5975120	5981120	And I also really liked using Marrow from time to time.
5983120	5986120	It was all about Servbot.
5986120	5991120	Servbot. Maybe. Maybe about Servbot. Yeah Servbot was great too.
5993120	5997120	Or I actually like using Hayato on the Capcom side.
5999120	6008120	Anyway, as far as its release, it was one of those Naomi games.
6009120	6011120	So it was released on Sega Naomi.
6011120	6017120	It was released on the Dreamcast in Japan March 30th 2000 in North America June 29th.
6018120	6022120	The European version came out July 16th and it was published by Virgin Interactive.
6023120	6030120	It had ports to PlayStation 2. Then we had the Xbox version and then PlayStation 2 version.
6031120	6034120	After that we had Xbox Live Arcade version and PSN.
6035120	6040120	And it actually became available on iOS April 25th June 2012.
6041120	6044120	Not terribly. Not seven years but still not terribly long ago.
6047120	6051120	But it's been of course delisted which makes me sad because it was actually pretty fun.
6052120	6055120	Anyway, it got really positive reviews.
6056120	6065120	A lot of websites and different review areas just absolutely just loved it.
6066120	6073120	On average, it scored above an 8 out of 10 from most places.
6074120	6077120	Although the Xbox version got a 3.9 from IGN.
6082120	6083120	I don't remember what was wrong with it.
6084120	6088120	Although people were complaining about the jazzy music. I thought the music was best.
6088120	6095120	The take you for a ride thing has been so iconic that they've reused it in other games.
6096120	6099120	I have to real quick start the video over because it's about to run out.
6100120	6101120	Because I didn't have enough b-roll tonight.
6102120	6104120	Actually, that's really about it.
6105120	6109120	It was just really really amazing because they're gonna take you for a ride.
6110120	6112120	And that particular theme has been reused in other games.
6113120	6115120	I did not realize Ruby Hart was an original.
6115120	6120120	But yeah, I remember playing her in the game and then I'm looking at it just now going,
6121120	6122120	she must be a Marvel character I'm not familiar with or something.
6123120	6126120	And no, I didn't really realize that until today that she was her original creation for that game.
6127120	6129120	I just assumed there was some pirate Marvel thing I didn't know about.
6130120	6132120	So how about that?
6133120	6134120	It's a good crossover.
6135120	6139120	My favorite crossover is Capcom SNK 2 specifically.
6140120	6142120	But I'm sure you'll cover that at a later time if you haven't already.
6143120	6144120	You probably did it at some point. Who knows?
6145120	6146120	I have no idea what I've done.
6147120	6149120	Yeah, I know. It's a long archive of games, that's for sure.
6150120	6151120	Holy shit it is.
6152120	6154120	Yeah, but Marvel vs. Capcom 2. Good pick.
6155120	6159120	Alright, some memories from our chat over twitch.tv slash vlog network.
6160120	6165120	SJ100Matt says, I remember going to Chinatown Fair to see the best MVC 2 fighters play.
6166120	6170120	And SJ100Matt also says, I have a few modded versions that would change the music.
6170120	6174120	Hey, DJ Ron Ma S, is it that place that I want you to take me to when I get to New York?
6175120	6178120	That was like the big awesome arcade that I watched the documentary on?
6179120	6181120	That had the dancing chicken?
6182120	6183120	Yes, it is.
6184120	6185120	See, I even know of that place.
6186120	6190120	By the way, I'm not going to have a lot of free time, but I think I confirmed for OLR.
6191120	6193120	Like, plane tickets are bought. I'm coming to New York.
6194120	6197120	And finally, after all this time, it's been like 10 years, I will be in New York.
6197120	6202120	It's whatever Indigenous Peoples Day weekend is in November.
6203120	6206120	It's like the second weekend of November. I think I fly in on like the 8th and I leave that Monday.
6207120	6209120	Oh, and by the way, you can't PM me, Ron Ma.
6210120	6212120	So, yes, I will be in New York.
6213120	6216120	Now, I'm going to be busy because we're going to see like two Broadway shows.
6217120	6218120	And they're very important.
6219120	6225120	We bought tickets to see Jagged Little Pill on Broadway because I am hashtag that bitch.
6225120	6227120	And you've seen Weird Al like 20 times. I've seen Alanis Morissette like eight.
6228120	6229120	So, I had to see the Broadway show.
6230120	6234120	But then for Alan, because it's his favorite movie of all time and he's seen it eight times,
6235120	6239120	we're also going to go see Moulin Rouge on Broadway, which I can't wait to see it as a stage show.
6240120	6241120	Like, I think it's going to be a phenomenal stage show.
6242120	6243120	The only thing that I want to see is Gone.
6244120	6245120	Oh, what's that?
6246120	6248120	Cats. Because I saw it the one time I was there.
6249120	6251120	You got the movie, though. The movie's coming.
6251120	6254120	Because of the movie, I'm sure the play will tour again.
6255120	6256120	It may not be back on Broadway, but it will probably tour again.
6257120	6261120	I would love for them to bring it back to the Winter Garden Theater so I can just go see it in the original location.
6262120	6263120	The Winter Garden was Mama Mia's home for years and years, too.
6264120	6265120	It was Rocky, too.
6266120	6267120	Was it really? Wow.
6268120	6269120	All right. Yes, I'm sorry. It's Veterans Day weekend.
6270120	6272120	Why did I say I was thinking October?
6273120	6274120	I don't know why I thought it was October.
6275120	6276120	Hello. Yes, it is November. It is Veterans Day weekend.
6277120	6278120	Thank you for the correction. How embarrassing.
6279120	6280120	I knew it was a three-day weekend of some sort.
6281120	6282120	So, anyway.
6283120	6285120	All right. Let's move on. Let's talk about some other gaming news.
6286120	6288120	Let's do some rapid fire news. Loki.
6289120	6295120	So this is pretty wholesome, but apparently fans and I guess the No Man's Sky subreddit,
6296120	6300120	they've raised money to put up a billboard outside of Hello Game Studios saying,
6301120	6302120	Thank you, Hello Game.
6303120	6307120	And it's from No Man's Sky the game subreddit and Explorers everywhere.
6308120	6309120	That's awfully nice.
6309120	6319120	Apparently, they also raised so much money that they have extra money to donate to a children's hospital for games and console donations.
6320120	6321120	Yeah. They've done something like this before.
6322120	6325120	I want to say like a year ago when they did their last big patch, the fans bought a billboard.
6326120	6330120	So I don't know if this is like, I mean, it's obviously it did happen again this week, so it's worth reporting.
6331120	6332120	But, you know, the fans have kind of done this before.
6333120	6337120	Hey, I will take this to the cyberbullying that they all got the week the game released.
6337120	6340120	Yeah. So this is this is far better, like good feels.
6341120	6345120	This is the type of stuff I'd rather be talking about as opposed to Twitter bullying campaigns.
6346120	6350120	So good job to the folks involved with this on Reddit and all that.
6351120	6357120	And speaking of games being remade or new sequels out of nowhere, especially with like Hooking Mama.
6358120	6361120	Now we have Bubble Bobble 4 coming out.
6361120	6365120	It's going to be exclusive to the Switch, Bubble Bobble 4 Friends.
6366120	6373120	And apparently it's got, you know, four player co-op and it's coming out the first quarter of 2020.
6374120	6380120	But it's interesting that I think it's in Europe right now that they have it releasing.
6381120	6386120	They don't, I guess later this year in Europe, November 19th, first quarter 2020 for the US.
6387120	6390120	If you want to purchase it earlier, you make a Europe account and purchase it that way.
6391120	6393120	Wow. That's that's weird that Europe's getting it first.
6394120	6396120	I mean, hooray for you guys, because usually you have to wait.
6397120	6398120	So I suppose it's our turn.
6399120	6403120	But for a big game like Bubble Bobble, that seems like a big gap between the Europe release and the US release.
6404120	6411120	And it looks interesting. They've even got looks like different like Space Invaders stuff in there, like kind of in the back of it, like little Taito stuff in there.
6412120	6413120	So little tie ins to other Taito stuff.
6414120	6416120	Yeah. So, you know, different levels, I guess that tie in with that.
6416120	6421120	But Taito's also Groove Coaster, right? So maybe some of that music, who knows?
6422120	6426120	Yeah, I could always be down for a remixed version of the Bubble Bobble theme.
6427120	6430120	Yeah, cool. All right. All right. I'm looking forward to that.
6431120	6437120	Anyway, moving on to Forza Motorsport 6. It's being delisted. It's kind of weird.
6438120	6441120	That's a big game to be delisted, but the title is going to be getting delisted.
6442120	6443120	I guess Forza games regularly get delisted.
6443120	6449120	Well, it's two years old. It's not two years old. It's the version before seven.
6450120	6458120	Yeah, it's I'm sure has to do with the licenses, the cars and things like that, because I want to say five and four were going went through some similar things, too.
6459120	6465120	But anyway, on September 15th, the game, the DLC are going to be gone from the Xbox Live Marketplace and you will no longer be able to buy it digitally.
6466120	6469120	But if you did already buy it or its DLC, you do still get to have access to it.
6469120	6474120	So, of course, now everything's got to go deep discount, got to go sale. Right.
6475120	6477120	Kind of similar to the DuckTales thing that we reported on last week.
6478120	6483120	So Turn 10 is offering the complete add ons collection pack for 95 percent off.
6484120	6487120	This was DLC that was one hundred dollars before five bucks.
6488120	6490120	Every single thing from Forza 6 over the lifetime.
6491120	6492120	I can't complain. That's on PC, right?
6493120	6495120	Yeah, I imagine it's a Microsoft. It's got to be.
6495120	6501120	So if you are Xbox Live Gold, guess what? You can get this with games of gold.
6502120	6503120	So you get it free of charge and all that good stuff.
6504120	6510120	And you can get the five dollar DLC pack and then you have like everything you could ever want with Forza Motorsport 6.
6511120	6519120	Not OK. And Bobby is clarifying six was not on PC, probably because that was before Microsoft started kind of making it easy.
6520120	6521120	But OK, thank you for the clarification.
6522120	6525120	This is not to be confused, of course, with Forza Horizon.
6526120	6529120	I think many of you know now there is a big difference between those two franchises.
6530120	6534120	Forza Horizon is meant to be the more racy, arcadey type of game.
6535120	6537120	Forza Motorsport is more of the simulation.
6538120	6541120	Think more like Gran Turismo versus like Mario Kart.
6542120	6546120	I don't know what else to compare Horizon to, but they are not the same type of game.
6547120	6548120	Gran Turismo to your need for speed.
6548120	6555120	Yeah, for for me, I'm not a big Forza Motorsport person, but I love the Horizon series.
6556120	6563120	And if this were Horizon being delisted, I probably would make sure I have like the jumbo pack for five bucks so that I have everything ever.
6564120	6568120	So there you go. But I'm sure some of you are going to jump on that just because it's your last chance.
6569120	6570120	And that's a heck of a sale. It really is.
6571120	6573120	Also being delisted, Grid 2.
6573120	6578120	That's right. Grid 2 has been removed from Steam and the rest of my story won't load.
6579120	6581120	So I don't know what else to say on that, but I think there isn't a lot else to say on that.
6582120	6588120	It's going through a similar thing and it probably, again, has to do with cars or music licenses and what these games tend to go through sometimes.
6589120	6594120	Yeah. And I actually think I have Grid 2, which is kind of cool. I got in, I think, a Humble Bundle or something like that.
6595120	6599120	I feel like Grid was another one of those games that was like a PlayStation or Xbox Plus thing.
6599120	6608120	Yeah. They had given it away back in March and apparently they're saying that they don't see why.
6609120	6611120	It was a Humble Bundle game. I remember getting it. You're right. You're right.
6612120	6619120	But it's not saying exactly why it's being delisted. I guess expiring licenses are basically the same thought.
6619120	6630120	Yeah. Apparently it'll be out in the next game. They have another game of the series called Grid that's coming out October 11th.
6631120	6635120	So it's a new game. Not to be confused with the original Grid. It is a new Grid.
6636120	6638120	Like, you know, the Xbox One of the Grid series, if you will.
6639120	6645120	Yes. You know, and even though we talk about these games being delisted, these were all games that existed on disc format too.
6646120	6647120	So you can get these games.
6647120	6650120	God, Grid was like an Xbox 360 game, I think.
6651120	6657120	Yeah, it was. And then, of course, Forza was a huge, Forza 6, when it first came out, was a huge Xbox One push.
6658120	6660120	So, you know, you can find these games on disc, so they're not going to be gone forever.
6661120	6664120	But, you know, for those of you that like to do your shopping digitally, these things happen.
6665120	6670120	All right. One more story for Rapid Fire. Rapid Fire's taking a while tonight, but there's a lot to say.
6670120	6677120	This is kind of interesting. Who remembers the Super Mario Brothers movie from 1993 with Bob Hoskins, rest in peace?
6678120	6679120	How can you forget it?
6680120	6684120	Yeah. Well, after all these years, apparently a deleted scene has resurfaced on the internet.
6685120	6689120	So if you want to see something you didn't get to see in the first movie, you can check that out now on YouTube.
6690120	6691120	Is the deleted scene a good movie?
6692120	6699120	It's a deleted scene, but it's Mario and Luigi answering the call for a job at the Riverfront Cafe where they encounter the Scapelli plumbers.
6700120	6703120	And that's, I have no idea what any of that means because I don't remember the movie.
6704120	6708120	I don't think I actually ever saw the movie. I don't think I ever saw the Super Mario Brothers movie.
6709120	6713120	I mean, can you blame me? I saw the wizard. That was the only Mario Brothers movie you needed to see.
6714120	6721120	I saw that in the drive-in. I brought a notepad to make sure that I took notes about everything about Super Mario Brothers 3.
6722120	6723120	I was little at the time.
6724120	6726120	I love it. No, you're a nerd. I love it. You're probably as old as your kids are now.
6727120	6728120	Yeah. That's awesome. I love it.
6728120	6736120	Cause I was super excited about, you know, they're going to be show because like, it's like the first time you get to see Super Mario Bros 3.
6737120	6741120	So like, you know, it's like worlds exclusive trailer thing.
6742120	6746120	And as they're saying in chat, it was a Nintendo direct, but on the movies theater screen, it was great.
6747120	6751120	Oh yeah. No, I made my dad take me to see that when I was like, I would have probably been like 12 or something.
6751120	6758120	I made my dad take me to see that. And he's, he used to kind of have to take me to see all the like kid movies that he probably didn't really want to see.
6759120	6761120	But he like, whatever. Yeah. There was one just take a nap. There was one too.
6762120	6766120	Like I remember we saw that it was a double feed because they always have double features with, um, drive-ins.
6767120	6772120	So it was like something in Batman or bat. I think it was like the original Batman movie or Batman returns or something like that.
6773120	6778120	And I had fallen asleep and woke up after the movie was over. I'm like, why didn't you wake me up for this movie?
6778120	6783120	Well, you said you didn't watch him. Like, I don't care. You wake me up for Batman. What the hell?
6784120	6794120	It's like, you know, I guess my mom told me, Oh, hey, look, it's the Batmobile. And I was asleep. I'm like, you shake and wake me up.
6795120	6805120	Especially Batman returns. Like I would have been so mad. Like, Oh my God. Like if somebody had let me sleep through Michelle Pfeiffer's performances, Catwoman, like that, that, that was like, that was gay culture.
6805120	6816120	That was my first exposure to gay culture was Michelle Pfeiffer's Catwoman. Wouldn't you say Dark Soccer, that Michelle Pfeiffer's Catwoman is like important, like gay culture that needs to be seen?
6817120	6819120	Julie Newmar's Catwoman is more important.
6820120	6830120	That's like old school. Like, but yes. And, or Eartha Kitt is an acceptable answer too. Anyway, uh, moving on, uh, Dark Soccer, what do you have for, uh, rapid fire news for us?
6830120	6848120	River City Girls. Um, the, uh, spin on the River City Ransom games, um, is only going to be local co-op and not online. They think that it's going to be more enjoyable for, for people to play with friends in person as opposed to paying, playing online.
6849120	6859120	They said that they could explore it for a follow-up, but not for this one. It's going to be in person with your friends in the room with you play only. I think that's good.
6860120	6871120	Um, and then it has been, uh, spoken about Power Stone. Their producer would love to make a new installment and thinks that the Switch is going to be the perfect home for it.
6872120	6873120	Yes, please.
6873120	6887120	Tesco was like, um, we're, we're taking a look at it. We're looking at what has lasting appeal and we still get a lot of questions about Power Stone pretty much. So, um, so he's thinking about doing another one if they get a chance.
6888120	6895120	And he in particular said it would be a particularly great fit for the Nintendo Switch, end quote. So we'll see.
6896120	6897120	Yes, please.
6898120	6899120	Double yes, please.
6899120	6908120	All right. Well, we're still going with our show here as one might say four or five still alive. Anyway, let's move on to some world release dates.
6909120	6925120	All right. So the best way to kick off this week is we have a game coming out called Rad and it's on a PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. So it's a rogue-like game, a nineties rogue-like game.
6926120	6928120	If it's not based on the eighties movie, I'm not interested.
6929120	6941120	No, it is not the BMX, the awesome BMX movie. Unfortunately it is a game by Double Fine though. So it's an isometric rogue-like.
6942120	6954120	Anyways, other stuff. So we also have Remnants from the Ashes on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. Roman Rumble in Las Vegas, Asterix and Oblix.

7011120	7018120	Oh yeah, I've seen a lot of hype building up for that and everybody will play it for a week and then go, this is terrible and stop all this time waiting for that.
7019120	7025120	Anyway, we'll see though. Moving over to Japan and checking out some of the releases there. Oninaki comes out on the 22nd of August.
7025120	7030120	You can also get a game called Tokyo Chronos this week. Both of those releases on the PlayStation 4.
7031120	7037120	Over on the Nintendo Switch this week, Mary Skelter 2. I don't know what that is but it's an irregular and limited edition.
7038120	7048120	Arcade Love plus Pango comes out this week. Is that like the old ass Pango? Oh, it's like a collection of old school games and I'm guessing Pango is one of them.
7048120	7055120	A collection of four games including two mini games to test your skills and a shmup called Combat Zeal and Pango.
7056120	7061120	Oh, I thought it was based on the little 80's arcade game with the penguin. Oh no, it is in there.
7062120	7068120	It's just some new version of it. It looks like a four player version of Pango. What the hell is that? I kind of want to play that. That looks kind of cool.
7069120	7072120	I wonder if they'll release something like that here. Pango Championship Edition? I guess. I don't know.
7072120	7086120	Mary Skelter 2 is a Compile Heart title and it looks like good looking anime girls but in a scary game. It takes place in jail I think.
7087120	7094120	Possessed demon girls that are still super quiet. Alright, Dark Sakura. What about Europe?
7094120	7115120	In Europe we have, you know, it would be nice if I didn't have exactly lost everything I was looking at. On the 19th we have Yu-Gi-Oh! Legacy of the Duelists Link Evolution and Assassin's Creed Origins plus Odyssey on the 22nd. That's it.
7115120	7124120	Alright, then we'll move right on into the mailbag. Every week we invite you guys to email us. Participate at OrangeLawnTrader.com and we read our favorite emails here on the show.
7125120	7140120	Actually we pretty much, as long as they're not mean or spam, we pretty much read all the emails on here. Unless we get a week where we have like 10 emails which hasn't happened in years but I do know sometimes if we get too many emails in a week we have to not read some on air.
7141120	7143120	But I think we have one tonight? Question mark?
7143120	7145120	We have a couple. Just give me a quick moment.
7146120	7151120	Oh yeah, you're fine. Go into our chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network.
7152120	7158120	Dartatia said, okay for a second I thought Loki said Bart's Tale. Now I'm envisioning a Simpsons RPG.
7159120	7166120	Whatever happened to all like the Simpsons parody games? We used to have so many of them. Like they had their own Grand Theft Auto. Remember that? There was a Simpsons Grand Theft Auto game.
7167120	7172120	I remember Bart's Nightmare on the Super Nintendo. That was a strange game but I played a lot of that I remember.
7173120	7176120	So has there been a Simpsons video game in years?
7177120	7188120	No. Not since I think the arcade game. No, no, no. I take that back. They did have a Simpsons game that came out on Playstation 3 and Xbox 360 I think at one time.
7189120	7193120	Bobby Blackwell reminds me there's a mobile game too that tapped out or whatever. That's great bother.
7194120	7200120	We had a bunch of them. One of them was on the 11th on Sunday so I don't know if you read one about Danganronpa?
7200120	7204120	No go for it. But we got a bunch of emails from Robert M. pretty much.
7205120	7211120	So also as Metal Mayhem can tell you the original Danganronpa was on sale for $4. Took a chance on my old MacBook and it runs beautifully.
7212120	7217120	Played through the first three chapters over what had to be more than three hours but that's what it claims the playtime is.
7218120	7224120	I love Danganronpa. I know so many people that eat those games up. I have yet to spend time with them.
7225120	7227120	But yeah I know people love that series.
7227120	7231120	And then the three four stars I have are Nothing Remarkable, Tangela, Swalot, and Buneary.
7232120	7236120	And if you didn't get my addendum skip this sentence I did. Oh Danganronpa. Yeah same thing.
7237120	7244120	There's another one and it says the same thing. And then one from Rageinator and good it's short.
7245120	7253120	Hi all. Last second email. Since the subject of video game music was covered early in the show when talking about Nintendo having YouTube channels shut down.
7253120	7257120	I'd like to ask you this question. What is your favorite video game soundtrack that you have?
7258120	7267120	The limiting factor is that it has to be a legit version of the soundtrack. Be it on a retail CD, vinyl, or bought from a digital retailer like iTunes or Amazon.
7268120	7272120	But that's the way we buy music now Rageinator. I haven't bought a CD.
7273120	7277120	Ripped or pirated don't count. He says his favorite is the soundtrack to Final Fantasy Tactics.
7277120	7288120	For the record I have many legit originals including both Bust a Move, Bust a Move 2, I have some DDR soundtracks and we've got all this DDR soundtracks that we were given too.
7289120	7296120	Well then I'm just going to give my answer because it would be because we used to import that type of stuff and would pay money to get official DDR soundtracks.
7296120	7307120	So I would say Dance Dance Revolution probably. I don't think I ever actually had third mix but I had. Didn't they do a soundtrack for extra mix that was the solo.
7308120	7315120	Okay then that that one I bought because I had the sexy nurse on the cover right because it was the female announcer. That was my favorite the extra DDR extra mix.
7315120	7326120	I do have the was it three four disc set for initial D and which of course I think you and I listen to it on a Disneyland trip and one good midnight maximum tune.
7327120	7336120	Wangan that music is fucking dangerous to listen to when you're driving. I've been driving down I-5 probably with you listening to fucking Yuzoku Shira like fucking techno music.
7337120	7343120	And then like checking the speedometer. Oh shit I'm going a hundred miles an hour. We did that in my Lancer. We did that in my Lancer.
7344120	7352120	But I've got just a bunch of really legit video game music soundtracks. So now I've got Apple music so I can listen to whatever the fuck I want whenever the fuck I want.
7353120	7362120	And on top of that because except Nintendo music because they're not on there. I do have some legit of those two like the the link to the past soundtrack.
7362120	7374120	And I have a bunch of Capcom fighting game soundtracks. But because I also have iTunes match all of my stuff hits the cloud so I can just stream all of my CDs from home whenever I want.
7375120	7381120	But I'm going to go and say the best that my favorite one that I own legit would probably be Silent Hill 3.
7382120	7394120	Ooh good choice. Yeah. Loki. I don't think I own anything that's legit anymore. I think the last thing I had was like a fourth mix and a extreme soundtrack.
7395120	7404120	Yeah I think we're kind of cheating your question Rage Nator because it's we were all Dance Dance Revolution fans. That was the stuff we used to import and get on CD so I'm not surprised to hear our answers are coming from there.
7404120	7415120	I always like the mega mix stuff that they have in there with the slight remixes of things that ended up becoming like you know songs that were in Max 2 and stuff like that from nonstop mega mix.
7416120	7424120	You know I found the full version of my baby daddy. Oh yeah. No because we played that on the show. I went on a hunt looking for four full versions of some of these songs.
7425120	7437120	I was just thinking I might still have some old ass soundtracks because you know we used we used to know people wink wink and would get like stacks and stacks and we never really gave them all away.
7438120	7447120	I still have like I feel like I have like a stack of CDs still that are like they're probably rares get like V rares they're probably worth something to somebody to like you're just sitting on those.
7447120	7456120	Oh there's another email another part of the email. OK. As a closing aside Mortal Kombat the album from 1993 was released on CD and had Mortal Kombat Dragon logo on the cover.
7457120	7467120	It was done by the Immortals had a song for each of the combatants as well as Techno syndrome a.k.a. the Mortal Kombat song that was used in the first Mortal Kombat movie spell out first and second please.
7468120	7475120	The song later got remixed by the Utah Saints. The album also had hypnotic house which was basically an alternate version of Techno syndrome.
7475120	7484120	There you go. All right. And is there another one. Yeah. God. Wow. Hi Y Y R. Hello L.R.
7485120	7494120	On last week's show you speculate as to whether the disclosure of loot box odds will actually cause any significant change of behavior among game developers that utilize them.
7495120	7499120	Obviously that remains to be seen but my personal belief is that it may reduce the likelihood of odds manipulation.
7499120	7506120	For example let's say you can clearly see that the odds of pulling a five star hero are listed at 10 percent. You buy a draw you actually pull a five star hero.
7507120	7514120	Naturally you have to decide if you want to try for another one. How do you feel if following your successful draw the odds were now listed at 2 percent.
7515120	7520120	This would reveal the developer was using an algorithm that worked similarly to prize games in arcades.
7521120	7527120	I'm sure that you've seen games in arcades with high value prizes like game consoles expensive headphones or even large ticket jackpots.
7527120	7531120	All of those games have an operator setting that allows you to control how often the games are winnable.
7532120	7536120	Usually after one of these games is when it can't be won again until a certain number of people have lost.
7537120	7541120	This practice ensures that owners and operators can't lose money on their high value prizes.
7542120	7546120	It's just like Vegas. But it also means that the game isn't based entirely on skill.
7547120	7553120	If more people were aware of this you think they would play these games as often because the odds of loot box prizes are not currently public.
7553120	7561120	Developers are free to use tactics such as these. But once they have to publish their numbers I'd be willing to bet that some of these games will work a bit differently than they do now.
7562120	7568120	For this reason alone the fact that these numbers will now be published is a big win for everyone except possibly the greedy companies.
7569120	7576120	I'll end simply with this note. Dance Rush is amazing. It's very easy to learn understand and play. You should make a trip to round one and try it already.
7577120	7582120	Have fun. Aaron why why are you I'm overdue for a trip to round one but in a matter of months we're finally going to have one here.
7583120	7588120	So there is that if we get one of those I think it's next year now. Oh you keep pushing the back.
7589120	7594120	I was just at the Galleria not that long ago for something. It's at twenty twenty. Yeah. All right whatever.
7595120	7605120	But soon they opened a brand new round one not far from where Captain Spike used to live. It's in Hayward because I think J.D. just had a birthday and I think he went over there.
7606120	7611120	I think it was that one I could be wrong. I know he went to like around one for his birthday recently which happy belated if you're out there.
7614120	7621120	Is that it. Yeah that's it. That's it for emails. Let's move on. We have more news and then we're going to get to your calls if we have any tonight on discord.
7622120	7634120	But we still have a few stories to get through first. Loki. So speaking of loot boxes and all that fun stuff apex legends who's you know been pretty lax on the whole micro transaction stuff.
7634120	7648120	But now they have been going crazy with it. They have a brand new apex legends event that had basically in order to get this one virtual acts that was in the game.
7648120	7666120	You'd have to spend about one hundred and sixty dollars and then ten dollars to unlock this thirty five dollar virtual acts because you had to purchase all of the other things that are part of this iron crown collection in order to get the ravens bite which is an heirloom melee item or whatever.
7666120	7677120	So that's a bit ridiculous. I don't know if necessarily everyone would be willing to spend that kind of money to get that item but it is something that they had in there.
7678120	7688120	And of course people are kind of upset about the fact that oh it's one hundred seventy dollars for some fake game loot which is kind of ridiculous.
7689120	7700120	But apparently though this is being changed because of the outcry. So they're going to be mixing up the items that are in there so you do have an opportunity to get those other items instead.
7701120	7712120	So they're going to be actually circle or switching them out looks like every couple days from Tuesday Thursday and then Thursday Sunday Sunday Tuesday.
7712120	7728120	And so now instead of you know paying one hundred and seventy dollars you only have to pay eighteen hundred apex coins which if that's you know one to one as far as like that's I think that's eighteen dollars maybe.
7728120	7743120	I don't know. I'm just not interested to spend that kind of money for a weapon in the game but apparently they said that also future collection events will provide more ways to obtain items other than just buying apex packs.
7744120	7751120	Quest Buster in chat is saying the iron crown situation apex is just a mess especially after what happened in the sub Reddit.
7751120	7758120	It's interesting how you know the whole Reddit and that feedback stuff can really kind of have an effect on things but this almost sounds like EA fuckery in a way.
7758120	7760120	Oh God it has EA all over it.
7760120	7764120	We were kind of wondering like when is EA going to fuck up apex ledge up.
7765120	7766120	Here it is.
7767120	7770120	We can't get our money from need for speed heat.
7770120	7774120	So let's let's dial up the heat on those loot boxes in a bag.
7774120	7775120	It's playing apex.
7775120	7777120	No there's no such thing as a free game.
7780120	7782120	Quest Buster continuing his thoughts.
7782120	7787120	People were bringing up examples from Warframe which sells better cosmetics but at lower price points.
7787120	7790120	I love it when they start bringing out the receipts.
7791120	7794120	I mean technically they can charge whatever they want but you don't have to buy a damn thing.
7794120	7798120	I mean you don't you don't have to play a video game with your dollars.
7798120	7799120	Yep exactly.
7799120	7801120	And that's the one thing we always kind of forget.
7801120	7807120	You don't have to play a video game like jacking up the price of water at music festivals and things like that.
7807120	7809120	That's different because you have to have water.
7809120	7814120	So like you get into like a legal situation that but when it comes to like video games they can charge as much they want.
7815120	7828120	Instead of spending like a possible 18 dollars on those boxes you can buy the Jackbox Party Pack Humble Bundle that is out that you know you can get all those different Jackbox games for probably around the same amount of money.
7828120	7831120	Or you can get a six month subscription to VOG Network on Twitch.
7831120	7832120	There you go. Or that.
7835120	7837120	I think that's the best use of your money myself.
7837120	7838120	All right.
7839120	7841120	How else are we going to be able to afford all those apex coins?
7842120	7845120	Yeah. How else are we going to be able to turn around and spend your money on apex coins?
7845120	7847120	No that is not what we spend it on.
7847120	7849120	Clearly it's the default of a team.
7849120	7857120	We had some new flyers printed for Dragon Con and well actually they were printed for Southern Fried Game Room and we just got enough so they're for Dragon Con as well.
7857120	7860120	And yeah so other other fun stuff to look forward to in the future.
7860120	7867120	Anyway some things that people were maybe looking forward to in the future was a streaming Xbox.
7867120	7875120	At least this was the way that we thought that Microsoft was going to be going is that we just assumed that hey Microsoft is probably going to be doing a streaming Xbox at some point.
7875120	7879120	But Phil Spencer has come out and said maybe not so much.
7879120	7890120	Phil Spencer in an interview with GameSpot said no they're not working on a streaming only console but they're working on the cloud gaming platform to do convenience and choice on the smartphone.
7890120	7894120	Phil Spencer does say this is one of the directions that the industry is headed.
7894120	7898120	It's inevitable that it's going to happen but they're not going there right now.
7898120	7902120	Saying we have more compute devices around us than we've ever had.
7902120	7905120	Whether it's your phone, a Surface Hub or an Xbox.
7905120	7911120	The world where compute devices are gone and it's all coming from the cloud just isn't in the world that we live in today.
7911120	7920120	It should be noted that xCloud is launching in October kind of officially letting you stream games from your Xbox One to your smartphone.
7920120	7929120	This may also play into a little bit that big big fat rumor we had last week about the shell for your phone the controller shell.
7929120	7934120	That would let you kind of take that wherever that would be very interesting if that ended up being their solution.
7934120	7936120	Because technically he's not lying in this case.
7936120	7943120	It's not a dedicated system it's just something that turns your phone into even that much more of a package for playing games.
7943120	7948120	Which would make a lot of sense to me to see it go that way.
7948120	7950120	So we'll see.
7951120	7956120	Anyway I don't know if anybody here is interested in a streaming only Microsoft device.
7956120	7962120	Because I figure most of us you know if we bought a Microsoft we just bought the console.
7962120	7966120	But I mean I don't know those of you that don't have Xbox Ones which I think is everybody but me.
7966120	7970120	I mean would you be interested if they had a streaming system solution.
7970120	7972120	I just I still don't think that really changed the equation.
7972120	7974120	I think in a way he's right.
7974120	7976120	I think Phil Spencer is smart and that's why Microsoft is ahead.
7976120	7981120	I think he's right that like if they're going to have success with it it's going to be on phones on computers on tablets.
7981120	7983120	And the things that we already have.
7983120	7990120	And I think the smartest thing they can do is make your phone better able to play these games with that controller shell.
7990120	7993120	If that is a real solution it's a brilliant one.
7993120	7998120	And that's going to be a far better solution like if I would look at getting something like that.
7998120	7999120	Are you kidding.
7999120	8000120	It's going to be amazing.
8000120	8001120	Yeah we'll see.
8001120	8002120	All right.
8002120	8004120	Moving on.
8004120	8006120	Dark soccer.
8006120	8013120	Well I know I've brought up the IQ before which is basically how Nintendo gets games out in China.
8013120	8018120	This is basically what they did to bypass laws against video games.
8018120	8025120	The company that runs it is a Nintendo owned subsidiary.
8025120	8031120	So Nintendo and TechNet are getting together of course to release the Switch in mainland China.
8031120	8040120	IQ shifted focus into development testing localization and now they're hiring game programmers and testers.
8040120	8049120	So it looks like someone a user on reset era found this and is looking at an intent.
8049120	8056120	So basically Nintendo is repurposing the IQ subsidiary even though right now they are still you know that platform.
8056120	8058120	So we'll see what happens.
8058120	8059120	That could be interesting.
8059120	8061120	I wonder what Nintendo might be planning in China.
8061120	8065120	Like I wonder maybe some localization of some of their games or who knows.
8065120	8068120	They're hiring programmers so they're going to be doing development.
8068120	8071120	So maybe they're becoming an intended development house.
8071120	8072120	Maybe.
8072120	8074120	Specifically maybe for the Chinese market.
8074120	8075120	That would be interesting.
8075120	8077120	Can you imagine things that are developed specifically for the Chinese market.
8077120	8078120	Yeah.
8078120	8079120	From Nintendo.
8079120	8080120	That could be very interesting.
8080120	8082120	But I mean we have to remember there's a lot of people in China.
8082120	8084120	So it's a it's a pretty big country.
8084120	8086120	I don't know if you've heard of it.
8086120	8087120	There's a lot of people there.
8087120	8090120	So I mean it would make sense for video game companies.
8090120	8093120	I think I feel like they're kind of like always trying to get into China.
8093120	8096120	But then something like slows them down or keeps them out.
8096120	8099120	Whether it be the big firewall or whatever it is.
8099120	8100120	We'll see.
8100120	8103120	Be interesting to see if Nintendo has more success there.
8103120	8104120	All right.
8104120	8106120	Well moving on just a couple more stories for you guys.
8106120	8108120	Then we're going to get some calls over on Discord.
8108120	8110120	So if you want to get in tonight.
8110120	8114120	vognetwork.com slash Discord is the place to get into our Discord server.
8114120	8115120	Meanwhile.
8116120	8119120	There is something actually wholesome on Twitter.
8119120	8128120	So apparently Twitter's got this new bot that was created by a guy named Neil Ceceria.
8128120	8132120	And he created this Twitter account called Endless Jeopardy.
8132120	8140120	And allows basically algorithm creates trivia questions for which players must generate answers.
8140120	8143120	Obviously because it's an algorithm it doesn't make any sense.
8143120	8150120	And so it's oh it's like one of those like I had my computer watch a hundred episodes of Friends.
8150120	8152120	And then generate its own Friends script.
8152120	8154120	And here's what it looks like it's one of these things.
8154120	8155120	Yes it's kind of silly stuff like that.
8155120	8163120	And so it's basically the way you play the game is you respond to the question.
8163120	8165120	Well you respond to the answer with a question.
8165120	8166120	Yes that's how Jeopardy works.
8166120	8171120	And then whoever gets the most likes you get points based on that.
8171120	8174120	And so they actually tally what your winnings are and everything like that.
8174120	8175120	So it's pretty cool.
8175120	8176120	So you can check it out.
8176120	8180120	Endless Jeopardy is the Twitter account.
8180120	8186120	And you may find such wonderful submissions like for example.
8186120	8190120	Endless you might find this Cole slightly excited.
8190120	8195120	Or this 1988 scandal was caused by a democratic internet.
8195120	8198120	It's called the city of risks.
8199120	8204120	Before life as a troublemaker she bide socks.
8204120	8206120	And they actually have the answers to these.
8206120	8209120	Yeah like so for example this last one in the city of risks.
8209120	8211120	I want to know what the city of risk.
8211120	8214120	Well it's whatever people think it is and whoever gets the most.
8214120	8217120	It's so it's puns and stuff like that.
8217120	8224120	So like for example the one that one was what is new Amsterdam.
8224120	8226120	It would be funny if it was new hand.
8226120	8227120	Amsterdam.
8227120	8229120	See that's funny.
8229120	8230120	Or what.
8230120	8233120	What's joint city city new joint city.
8233120	8234120	Okay.
8234120	8235120	See there.
8235120	8236120	There you go.
8236120	8238120	Corpus risky Texas.
8238120	8239120	Corpus risky.
8239120	8240120	That's funny.
8240120	8241120	There you go.
8241120	8244120	So it's it's filled with puns and stuff like that.
8244120	8249120	The one I think that one for the first one I read you might find this Cole slightly excited
8249120	8253120	was a carbon dating.
8253120	8254120	Okay that's good.
8254120	8258120	So it's every 15 minutes and you basically put your responses in the form of a question
8258120	8263120	and then if you get as you know as many likes as you can and then you rack up points that
8263120	8270120	way and it's going to go on forever until Twitter ends until the end.
8270120	8273120	So so if you're bored one day and you're looking for something to do.
8273120	8274120	There you go.
8274120	8275120	Not even the end of the world.
8275120	8276120	It's the end of Twitter.
8276120	8281120	These are very distinctly different things.
8281120	8285120	Sorry I don't know why the thought of the end of Twitter is just like so hilarious to
8285120	8287120	me but it is all right.
8287120	8290120	Maybe because I kind of sometimes wish that site would just go under.
8290120	8292120	You know it pisses me off about Twitter.
8292120	8296120	Everything I couldn't like just despite the fact that the dump is on it.
8296120	8302120	No just even all that garbage aside like the fact that I downloaded the latest version
8302120	8305120	on iOS and I'm like Twitter is unusable.
8305120	8310120	All I'm seeing is people replying to other people and things that other people have liked
8310120	8311120	Echo phone.
8311120	8312120	No I.
8312120	8313120	No no no no.
8313120	8314120	No.
8314120	8315120	No.
8315120	8316120	Can I finish my story.
8316120	8317120	No.
8317120	8318120	Yes it's a Twitter thing.
8318120	8323120	But apparently at some point Twitter reverted from the latest tweets screen to the home
8323120	8328120	screen which shows you only the curated stuff and the curated stuff fucking sucks.
8328120	8331120	So Twitter needs to stop shoving that down my throat.
8331120	8334120	That's why I'm using a different app to read my Twitter.
8334120	8336120	I thought they killed all those third party apps.
8336120	8337120	No Echo phone has been working forever.
8337120	8338120	Well that's good.
8338120	8341120	And it does everything just straight up feed.
8341120	8342120	OK well that's good.
8342120	8346120	Well I use I use lists too was is the other way I do it.
8346120	8350120	So like that's how it because people go how do you follow eighteen hundred people on Twitter
8350120	8355120	because sure I read my regular feed once in a while but I also have a curated list of
8355120	8360120	like 30 people and that's the one where I actually stay current on all the statuses.
8360120	8364120	So anyway and no I'm not going to tell you who's on it who's not.
8364120	8365120	That's for me to know.
8365120	8367120	So but my co-hosts are on it.
8367120	8369120	I will say that I'm covered in your cat's hair.
8369120	8370120	I just realized what.
8370120	8371120	Why did you.
8371120	8372120	I love your shirt by the way.
8372120	8373120	I wish.
8373120	8374120	Thank you.
8374120	8375120	Well maybe after the show you can show it on camera.
8375120	8376120	You want to show it now.
8376120	8377120	Oh.
8377120	8378120	Oh there's a rare appearance here it is.
8378120	8379120	There it is.
8379120	8380120	Pride.
8380120	8381120	Love it.
8381120	8382120	All right.
8382120	8383120	Anyway.
8383120	8384120	OK.
8384120	8386120	I just don't want my broken out face all over.
8386120	8387120	Oh you're fine.
8387120	8388120	You look fine.
8388120	8391120	And besides the light washes all of that out.
8391120	8392120	All right.
8392120	8395120	Anyhow moving on to a story.
8395120	8400120	Speaking of Nintendo being in a movie and the wizard and things we probably never thought
8400120	8402120	we would see in our lifetime but here we are.
8402120	8410120	Nintendo is partnering with E-League to broadcast the Nintendo 2019 World Championships on CBS.
8410120	8415120	E-League is part of Turner Broadcasting which obviously you know runs a lot of those networks
8415120	8416120	and things.
8416120	8420120	They do tournaments for Rocket League, Counter Strike, Street Fighter, Overwatch.
8420120	8428120	E-League is usually on TBS but on August 25th at 1 p.m. the Nintendo 2019 World Championships
8428120	8430120	will be shown on CBS.
8430120	8435120	There will be more episodes on September 7th at 2 p.m. and September 14th at 1 30 p.m.
8435120	8436120	That's pretty cool.
8436120	8440120	The first Nintendo World Championships was in 1990 and then they've brought it back in
8440120	8443120	recent years 2015 and 2017.
8443120	8446120	This is going to be the first time that it's on TV as opposed to Twitch.
8446120	8449120	I went to the 1991 to try to qualify.
8449120	8450120	Bobby Black Wolf.
8450120	8451120	I didn't qualify but I went.
8451120	8453120	I think Bobby Black Wolf did qualify.
8453120	8454120	He told the story on one of his shows.
8454120	8455120	I know he did.
8455120	8458120	So probably around the time it made a comeback.
8458120	8463120	So anyway, I think it's neat that they're showing esports like on TV and not just any
8463120	8467120	I mean we know there has been like Overwatch finals has been on ESPN and stuff.
8467120	8472120	But I mean like Nintendo and like that type of stuff that you know we really like again
8472120	8476120	many of us grew up with things like the Nintendo World Championships in our memory.
8476120	8481120	So the fact that that is now being shown on TV like that's kind of a huge deal I think.
8481120	8483120	Big big deal.
8483120	8485120	So very cool.
8485120	8488120	DJ Rama says does this mean we'll get the wizard on Blu-ray now.
8488120	8490120	I thought it was already on Blu-ray actually.
8490120	8491120	That's not a thing.
8491120	8492120	I thought it was.
8492120	8493120	All right.
8493120	8495120	I'm surprised that we have a lot of really surprising.
8495120	8497120	It's not a thing at this point.
8497120	8498120	So all right.
8498120	8501120	Well we are about to get to our phone calls.
8502120	8507120	So if you want to give us a call you can join our green room over at vognetwork.com slash discord.
8507120	8509120	I don't see anybody there right now.
8509120	8510120	And it may be a slow night.
8510120	8511120	I don't know.
8511120	8516120	But I'll check in and see if we have any last minute stories before we get to it.
8518120	8521120	Well there's the new Skyblivion thing that they made the announcement for.
8521120	8522120	That looks pretty awesome.
8522120	8523120	Oh yeah.
8523120	8524120	I didn't end up being able to squeeze this in the show world.
8524120	8525120	Tell us more about this.
8525120	8529120	So it's basically putting the world of Oblivion into the Skyrim engine.
8529120	8530120	I think that's awesome.
8530120	8531120	It's amazing.
8531120	8533120	So that should be coming out at some point.
8533120	8535120	If it hopefully doesn't get shut down by Bethesda.
8535120	8536120	God I love the modders.
8536120	8540120	I'm sure the modders will be less buggy than Bethesda too.
8540120	8545120	By the way also not making the show world tonight but a follow up to a joke from a couple weeks ago.
8545120	8547120	The whole Bethesda net account needed to play Doom.
8547120	8549120	Yeah they patched that out.
8549120	8550120	That has been officially patched out.
8550120	8551120	Well that's good.
8551120	8553120	The lead producer for Anthem is leaving BioWare.
8553120	8555120	I heard about this.
8555120	8556120	Tell us more.
8556120	8559120	Well I just found the story so I don't really know much about it.
8559120	8561120	Let me see.
8561120	8562120	Gosh.
8562120	8563120	Load faster.
8563120	8566120	Do you want me to get to a call and come back to you?
8566120	8567120	No I got it.
8567120	8569120	Ben Irving is leaving.
8569120	8571120	He posted it on Twitter.
8571120	8573120	He accepted a position with another company.
8573120	8577120	And that the game still quote has a bright future.
8577120	8579120	Fart.
8579120	8584120	But he said that BioWare was his dream place to work since the first time he played Baldur's Gate.
8584120	8587120	And blah blah blah blah blah.
8587120	8590120	So he's going away.
8590120	8592120	Well good luck.
8592120	8593120	Hopefully they will.
8593120	8599120	Hopefully your new company will support you and what you want to do and not try to shove $170 microtransactions down your throat.
8599120	8601120	Or force you to release games early.
8601120	8602120	Before they're done.
8602120	8603120	Alright.
8603120	8605120	Let's get to the calls shall we?
8605120	8608120	Hello you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?
8608120	8610120	Hey everybody it's Rama.
8610120	8613120	Hey Rama it's always good to hear from you. What's on your mind tonight buddy?
8613120	8619120	Awesome it's always good to not just hear from y'all but watch y'all too in living color.
8619120	8625120	Well be careful because one week we might do it in black and white just to throw y'all off your game.
8625120	8631120	I would like to see y'all do that and I can see it happening as an April Fools prank.
8631120	8634120	Don't give me ideas. What's on your mind tonight?
8634120	8635120	Too late.
8636120	8645120	Let me tell you. When I'm at work, once I get into the zone of taking care of my closing out tix and doing my research for certain support issues.
8645120	8654120	I have my headphones in and I open up YouTube and I have a little cumulative playlist of all types of music.
8654120	8658120	Especially a lot of gaming music to kind of get me through all of this.
8659120	8666120	I'm feeling how Nintendo is pulling these channels with the soundtracks but you know what?
8666120	8669120	It's like a weed. Kill one, two more pop up.
8670120	8674120	That is a very good point that I can't believe wasn't kind of stated early on.
8674120	8678120	You're right you might stop one channel but then even more are going to pop up.
8678120	8681120	I don't know if these channels monetized either.
8681120	8685120	I know I've seen YouTube channels that are just soundtracks that do monetize.
8685120	8690120	And I'm always very surprised at that because I think you're just making a slippery slope kind of a spiky one.
8690120	8692120	Because when you start monetizing off that stuff.
8692120	8695120	And again I don't know if these channels that got pulled were monetizing or not.
8695120	8699120	I'm just saying I have seen channels out there that do monetize with other people's soundtracks.
8699120	8703120	And that can be a yike situation just legally right?
8703120	8709120	Yeah it's like the whole thing of mods are gone post photos type situation.
8709120	8717120	But I'm not sure about which channels I go to that monetize because I use an ad blocker for a lot of channels.
8717120	8720120	You know so I can just get through my clients.
8720120	8728120	But you got this one channel with all of these Nintendo soundtracks that's like 10,000 subscribe.
8728120	8734120	I'll just go to the person that has not as many will have maybe about 500 subscribers.
8734120	8736120	And from there I'll just find other ones.
8736120	8743120	And also there are remix channels out there so I'm not so that's something as well.
8743120	8747120	And you know I wish Nintendo would just kind of come to that same realization.
8747120	8750120	And to be fair maybe they have we still have some time to see this.
8750120	8755120	But I wish Nintendo would just come to that same realization that like the music industry kind of ended up on years ago.
8755120	8758120	Like what finally put Napster in check?
8758120	8763120	I'm not gonna say killed Napster but what finally put Napster in check?
8763120	8765120	iTunes.
8765120	8773120	The ability to buy songs at a reasonable price that honestly it was just easier to pay a dollar to download a song.
8773120	8779120	Than to like try to go find on LimeWire the one that was like you know actually a virus for your computer and all this stuff.
8779120	8785120	Like when they made it reasonably like easy to buy music online piracy went way down.
8785120	8788120	Again I'm not gonna say it's ended because I'm not that bold.
8788120	8794120	But you know now the music industry is in a place where Spotify, Apple Music, YouTube Red.
8794120	8796120	Is it YouTube Red or whatever the YouTube premiums call it?
8796120	8798120	No it's YouTube Music.
8798120	8801120	Okay and all that stuff is what they have now.
8801120	8807120	So like you know Nintendo you're right pulling one channel is just gonna cause more to pop up.
8807120	8809120	That's what happened back in the day with Napster and all that.
8809120	8811120	You can't ban everybody.
8811120	8815120	But you can really slow it down if you legitimize it.
8815120	8824120	And there are actually apps out there where it's a YouTube-esque app where you can log in and it'll put your playlist or whatever.
8824120	8829120	And it'll stream all the music no commercials no nothing you know.
8829120	8833120	I personally don't use it because I don't need to when I'm traveling back and forth.
8833120	8838120	Because I have maybe about over a hundred gigs of music on my phone.
8838120	8841120	So I'm totally good with that along with podcasts you know.
8842120	8847120	Yeah and you know hey it's just Nintendo that's pulling their music.
8847120	8851120	There's tons of other companies out there that you know you can listen to their game music.
8851120	8856120	Hell there's a lot of indie artists that put their soundtracks to games up on YouTube.
8856120	8860120	And would love for you to give them that type of clicks and exposure.
8860120	8862120	So that's always something else to consider too.
8862120	8869120	Is that sure you know the Mario Brothers theme and the Nintendo music from games like Zelda and stuff.
8869120	8873120	You know that's like the John Williams Star Wars theme Jurassic Park theme.
8873120	8877120	That's the creme de la creme of the industry and the stuff we instantly recognize.
8877120	8884120	But it isn't to say there ain't a ton of really fucking good gaming music out there that is plenty also readily available for you.
8884120	8891120	So true and in the event that I can't find some of my favorite gaming soundtracks.
8891120	8895120	There are people who have anime soundtracks I can go listen to.
8895120	8899120	There are people who have TV show soundtracks I can go listen to.
8899120	8903120	I'm good one way or the other you know.
8903120	8908120	As Joe points out Toby Fox seems pretty cool about Undertale music being out in the wild.
8908120	8912120	Tiger class says the problem with buying music on iTunes is the music has DRM in it.
8912120	8914120	It'll only play on iTunes.
8914120	8920120	Well keep keep keep in mind a lot of that has evolved to Apple music and the streaming solutions.
8920120	8924120	And also I know what I would do I would just burn the music to CD.
8924120	8926120	Wrong anyway.
8926120	8931120	Anything that you buy in Apple and Apple on iTunes these days are not DRM.
8931120	8935120	It's the stuff that you get through Apple music because it's a subscription service has DRM.
8935120	8936120	Oh interesting.
8936120	8944120	And the only things on iTunes that are not in Apple music that do have DRM are required by the manufacturer or the recording label.
8944120	8946120	The more you know.
8947120	8954120	See that makes sense because there's a lot of anime soundtracks that hit iTunes and I'm just like I'll wait till it's on Amazon.
8954120	8957120	And then it gets to the point where I can't wait.
8957120	8963120	So I have to find alternate means to find it until I have the money to buy it.
8963120	8966120	And my thing is I don't want to be tied into iTunes.
8966120	8976120	But knowing this I can put the music on my phone is a default player and go about my day knowing I have supported somebody's craft.
8976120	8981120	Yeah I mean I've copied a lot of stuff.
8981120	8987120	I mean I'll test it just to be sure but I mean I look at this stuff every day.
8987120	8993120	I've been an iTunes user since before I had my iPhone when the first one came out.
8993120	9004120	So I remember when they moved away from the DRM thing and this was something like a decade ago for iTunes in particular they just raised the price of the music.
9004120	9011120	I think it's the aspect of people don't want to support iTunes. I get it. I understand it.
9011120	9020120	It's just my thing is this. I may not like that program but if that's who I have to go to to support take my money plain as day.
9020120	9025120	I want to put my personal differences aside to support an industry that I'm a part of.
9025120	9031120	Alright my friend I'm going to let you go so we can wrap up. Do you have any other last minute thoughts or comments?
9031120	9035120	Yes your trip to New York. I will make this brief and I'll go about my merry little way.
9035120	9042120	There is one thing that you need to do while you're here. Do a tour of NBC Studios.
9042120	9049120	Because during this tour they take you to a little talk show area where you can record your own talk show.
9049120	9060120	And I don't know how it piles through but you can get a copy of it and who knows you might be the lucky person sitting behind Jimmy Fallon's former desk doing Late Night with Rob Roberts.
9060120	9067120	I love it. You know it's funny I did do the NBC tour the last time I was there because we did the whole Top of the Rock thing.
9067120	9071120	And as part of the tour we got to go to the studio where they did Saturday Night Live.
9071120	9077120	And they told us we were very lucky because it was actually a Saturday and they were doing a show that night.
9077120	9083120	But we were able to go in there and whatever band was performing was actually on stage doing their thing.
9083120	9088120	And they had some of the actors were down on the floor like kind of bopping to it.
9088120	9091120	All I remember was that the guest host that night was John C. Reilly.
9091120	9097120	And this would have been like 2006-ish. So it was whatever that was. We were at the studio that day. It was pretty cool.
9097120	9105120	Okay. And sometimes if you're lucky depending on which date during the week you could see Seth Meyers or Jimmy Fallon you know.
9105120	9110120	Yeah it's trippy because it's like you know it's their place of work. It's their work building.
9110120	9113120	Alright my friend. Take care.
9113120	9114120	You too.
9114120	9115120	Alright. Bye bye.
9115120	9116120	Bye.
9117120	9120120	Alright. So we're going to go ahead and.
9120120	9124120	Hey. Okay. That's cool. The mouse just won't work now so I can't hang on.
9124120	9127120	When was the last time it got charged or it had batteries.
9127120	9129120	Is it. Oh is that why it's blinking.
9129120	9130120	Yeah.
9132120	9134120	Well this is embarrassing.
9134120	9139120	I hope I have the right. I know I hope I have the right battery for it or else we're not gonna be able to stop OLR tonight.
9139120	9142120	We're going to be streaming forever. Hope you guys are ready for it. Is this a double A.
9142120	9146120	Yeah it's double A. OK. So while I replace the battery y'all fill time.
9146120	9150120	Well you could have just like you know keyboard shortcuts. They have the access.
9150120	9154120	They have the accessibility modes. You know you could do that. It's fine.
9154120	9155120	Uh huh.
9156120	9157120	I don't know.
9157120	9159120	So I don't get.
9159120	9165120	Apparently there are Animal Crossing cross Sanrio NFC cards.
9165120	9171120	And I wonder if these were only in Japan right now they're doing for a pocket camp.
9171120	9174120	They're doing like a Sanrio crossover.
9174120	9184120	But I wonder if this is for like for like happy home designer or something.
9184120	9185120	I don't know.
9185120	9188120	I might have the wizard is on blue gray by the way.
9188120	9189120	It is right here.
9189120	9191120	I sees it right now.
9191120	9192120	OK.
9192120	9194120	I'm not going to buy it though because I don't want to.
9194120	9198120	Well I've already got that movie on 50 million other things too.
9198120	9201120	But yeah.
9201120	9204120	What else.
9204120	9209120	Oh Rob's coming back.
9209120	9210120	OK.
9210120	9211120	I got the battery fixed.
9211120	9217120	It was putting the fucking case or the little lid back on it that was like driving me bonkers.
9217120	9220120	And I'm like clicking everywhere on the screen while we do it.
9220120	9225120	All right. Well I don't think any other calls are coming in so we're going to go ahead and hang up on our discord server.
9225120	9230120	But if you want to join throughout the week you can of course over at vog network dot com slash discord.
9230120	9233120	But with that we are about towards the end of our show.

9291120	9296120	Dark Soccer. Ladies first we'll start with you.
9296120	9298120	That's it.
9298120	9299120	All right then we'll go to Loki.
9299120	9302120	I did end up picking up No Man's Sky on PC.
9302120	9304120	So I may have to try playing that.
9304120	9308120	I may try it on the Rift but I just need room to play the Rift.
9308120	9310120	So I guess the kitchen.
9310120	9312120	We'll see.
9312120	9318120	All right and then my final thought is I'm looking very forward to my trip.
9318120	9322120	I'm going to be this is the longest I've been away from home for a long time because I'm going to be gone 10 days and all.
9322120	9323120	But I'm really excited for it.
9323120	9325120	Vacation is really good.
9325120	9331120	I also thanks to anybody I met playing the Survivor game that might actually be out there listening tonight.
9331120	9332120	Lots of great connections made.
9332120	9334120	Lots of good friendships made through that.
9334120	9338120	And but I'm happy to have my life back and streaming and doing all that other stuff again.
9338120	9341120	And I'm going to probably play some No Man's Sky on PC myself tonight.
9341120	9343120	Have a great week everybody.
