00:00.000 --> 00:17.480
This week, how do you turn a retail business into a business for the future?

00:17.480 --> 00:20.360
By laying off all the people that can help you accomplish it, apparently.

00:20.360 --> 00:22.520
Our best wishes to those impacted by this news.

00:22.520 --> 00:25.200
This is just one headline, stay tuned for the rest of the week's gaming news starting

00:25.200 --> 00:28.280
right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.

00:28.280 --> 00:37.160
Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of Orange

00:37.160 --> 00:42.940
Lounge Radio, the show where every gamer has a voice, not live, on this lovely Sunday evening

00:42.940 --> 00:45.880
with episode number 790 of our show.

00:45.880 --> 00:49.620
But I'll explain a little bit more on that in a moment, but we still have some things

00:49.620 --> 00:54.480
to go over, some news to discuss, some video games to play, gaming culture to cover, all

00:54.480 --> 00:55.480
that good stuff.

00:55.480 --> 01:01.100
Myself, Rob Roberts, joining you here on Twitch TV, twitch.tv slash vog network where

01:01.100 --> 01:06.280
we do broadcast, usually live, every Sunday night at 6 Pacific, 9 Eastern, although this

01:06.280 --> 01:09.280
week has been prior recorded earlier in the week.

01:09.280 --> 01:12.640
But it's going to feel like a little bit of a normal show, but maybe a little shorter

01:12.640 --> 01:16.720
because it's already kind of late on a Thursday night here in Studio N7.

01:16.720 --> 01:20.560
But joining me here on video for the show this week is Techmaster Loki.

01:20.560 --> 01:21.560
Hello, I'm here.

01:21.560 --> 01:22.560
Hi, how are you?

01:22.560 --> 01:24.020
I'm full now.

01:24.020 --> 01:25.740
That was some bomb ass chicken that you brought to the show.

01:25.740 --> 01:26.740
It was some bomb ass chicken.

01:26.740 --> 01:27.740
It's a bummer.

01:27.740 --> 01:33.180
It took me a while to get set up for the pre-recording thing because that was some good chicken.

01:33.180 --> 01:34.340
It was.

01:34.340 --> 01:36.860
It was a Korean chicken, Korean grilled chicken?

01:36.860 --> 01:41.420
It's supposed to be like Korean oven roasted chicken or oven, they also have fried chicken

01:41.420 --> 01:47.980
as well, but it's like that one was a garlic chicken, which was garlic soy sauce and honey

01:47.980 --> 01:48.980
or something.

01:48.980 --> 01:51.580
But, oh my God, it was so good.

01:51.580 --> 01:53.180
Like I'm already wanting to go back.

01:53.220 --> 01:54.220
All right, it smelled good.

01:54.220 --> 01:57.140
And I think Mr. Smoosh is going crazy over there about it too.

01:57.140 --> 02:02.460
You might see Mr. Smoosh cameo on cam tonight because there's an empty chair across there

02:02.460 --> 02:06.900
because she's not here in studio tonight, Dark Soccer or Jamie Summers.

02:06.900 --> 02:11.460
But thanks to the magic of the internet, she's joining us, as they say on the news, via satellite.

02:11.460 --> 02:13.180
Dark Soccer, are you there?

02:13.180 --> 02:17.020
I can't believe y'all haven't had Korean fried chicken before because that stuff is bomb.

02:17.020 --> 02:20.940
I feel like I had it once, but it was a long time ago, but-

02:20.940 --> 02:23.020
Did I ever take you to Bonchon?

02:23.020 --> 02:24.780
I don't think I've been to Bonchon.

02:24.780 --> 02:26.780
I know there's like, it's a chain now.

02:26.780 --> 02:28.300
There's like a couple of those around.

02:28.300 --> 02:32.460
No, the fried chicken I was all about recently was the halal fried chicken.

02:32.460 --> 02:33.460
That's pretty good.

02:33.460 --> 02:35.340
Oh man, that stuff is good.

02:35.340 --> 02:40.180
If their fried chicken is, I don't know, this chicken is pretty good, so I do need to try

02:40.180 --> 02:41.180
their fried chicken.

02:41.180 --> 02:42.180
I'm excited.

02:42.180 --> 02:43.180
Both of you.

02:43.180 --> 02:45.740
And the Popeye's new chicken sandwich that I hear is really awesome.

02:45.740 --> 02:50.740
I'm taking you both to Oakland and we are going to go to this hole in the wall called

02:50.740 --> 02:55.540
OB town that has the best Korean fried chicken you will ever put in your mouth.

02:55.540 --> 02:58.700
I am super excited for some KFC.

02:58.700 --> 03:00.580
Korean fried chicken.

03:00.580 --> 03:01.580
Real KFC.

03:01.580 --> 03:03.100
It's a real KFC.

03:03.100 --> 03:04.100
All right.

03:04.100 --> 03:06.700
Dark Soccer, why are you joining us remote tonight?

03:06.700 --> 03:10.220
I know we usually love to tape in the same room, but I heard you had a little accident.

03:10.220 --> 03:11.320
Are you okay?

03:11.320 --> 03:12.820
My face is broken.

03:12.820 --> 03:13.820
Well-

03:13.820 --> 03:15.220
Okay, so-

03:15.220 --> 03:18.980
I said something out of the ordinary.

03:19.540 --> 03:25.060
Yeah, so I fainted two days ago.

03:25.060 --> 03:26.060
Okay, that's scary.

03:26.060 --> 03:27.540
I'm a dick for making jokes.

03:27.540 --> 03:29.540
I'm sorry to hear that.

03:29.540 --> 03:34.740
Yeah, so basically I was standing, I had gotten up to go pee and then I went back to get that

03:34.740 --> 03:39.860
free standing minute on my Apple Watch and I got a little dizzy.

03:39.860 --> 03:45.140
Next thing I know, three minutes have passed, I'm on the ground and my face hurts.

03:45.180 --> 03:51.060
I apparently fell and hit my face hard on my bedside table.

03:51.060 --> 03:56.620
So I busted my lip, have some bone bruises on my chin and my cheekbone.

03:56.620 --> 04:02.940
Thankfully, no concussion or if it was a concussion, it was really minor.

04:02.940 --> 04:08.780
So I've been raging headaches for the past couple of days and so I was just like, I've

04:08.780 --> 04:14.020
got a bad headache and I'd rather be at home than be driving a longer distance when my

04:14.020 --> 04:15.420
head feels like this, so.

04:15.420 --> 04:17.140
Yeah, no, totally understandable.

04:17.140 --> 04:21.180
So we love to record in the same room and it's part of what makes our podcast special,

04:21.180 --> 04:26.380
but sometimes things are going to happen and if you had a thing where you fell and hurt

04:26.380 --> 04:32.220
your head, which by the way also happened to me, but it was maybe like four years ago,

04:32.220 --> 04:33.420
I had a similar thing.

04:33.420 --> 04:37.020
I think I was super dehydrated and I was in a very steamy room.

04:37.020 --> 04:41.420
I was basically in the shower kind of enclosed and the fan in there is terrible and I fainted.

04:41.420 --> 04:45.420
It was just like a thing out of the blue and I actually ended up chipping my front

04:45.420 --> 04:46.420
tooth.

04:46.420 --> 04:49.220
It was one of those things where I had to go to the dentist ASAP because I was freaking

04:49.220 --> 04:50.220
out.

04:50.220 --> 04:51.740
I was like, oh my God, my tooth is all chipped.

04:51.740 --> 04:58.420
So thankfully, dentists know how to work miracles and I look fine now, but it's scary.

04:58.420 --> 05:05.940
What happened too is I went and I did go to urgent care to get tested, make sure that

05:05.940 --> 05:14.740
everything was okay and it was a combination of dehydration and possibly anemia.

05:14.740 --> 05:17.560
So I'm drinking Pedialyte.

05:17.560 --> 05:23.860
It's disgusting, but I'm drinking it and just taking care of myself.

05:23.860 --> 05:27.700
Well what an interesting segue because one of the first things I want to talk about here

05:27.700 --> 05:30.660
at the top of the show is the Dragon Con hype.

05:30.660 --> 05:35.300
So it's funny you bring up Pedialyte because that's a great way to stop a hangover and

05:35.300 --> 05:40.140
there's going to be, well it is important to stay hydrated at Dragon Con and the reality

05:40.140 --> 05:45.540
is there's a lot of, because it's in enclosed hotels throughout the Atlanta area, there's

05:45.540 --> 05:47.460
a lot of alcohol consumption.

05:47.460 --> 05:51.660
People are just openly, because you can open carry because it's indoors.

05:51.660 --> 05:54.860
Usually you can't just open carry alcohol out on the street, but this convention is

05:54.860 --> 05:55.940
now on the street.

05:55.940 --> 06:01.260
So I think that's why it has a reputation for being such a, lots of libations and so

06:01.260 --> 06:02.260
forth.

06:02.260 --> 06:06.660
I mean, I'm not making it sound like it's a drunk party and if you're choosing to be

06:06.660 --> 06:08.540
sober or what have you, you can't have fun.

06:08.540 --> 06:09.540
I don't think that's true.

06:09.540 --> 06:12.940
I think you can still, actually there was, I think it was last year, it was probably

06:12.940 --> 06:16.940
just last year because there were so many panels that I was doing last year.

06:16.940 --> 06:21.060
I didn't really want to drink because I had to get up early to do a bunch of panels.

06:21.060 --> 06:26.380
So yeah, I didn't really indulge and I still had a great Dragon Con.

06:26.380 --> 06:31.020
So yeah, Mr. Smoosh is making his presence known here.

06:31.020 --> 06:33.660
If he keeps acting up off to put them in the other room.

06:33.660 --> 06:37.420
Don't you, don't you know, we're trying, I know we're usually here on Sunday, but don't

06:37.420 --> 06:38.420
you know, we're trying to do a show.

06:38.420 --> 06:41.420
If you're going to yell, at least come over here and do it.

06:41.420 --> 06:47.800
I think, I think he smells the KFC that was in here earlier anyway.

06:47.800 --> 06:51.500
So I do want to say a big hello to anybody that may have discovered this show, thanks

06:51.500 --> 06:52.500
to Dragon Con.

06:52.500 --> 06:57.940
Cause I know I'm going to be selling the crap out of this show and other stuff that I work

06:57.940 --> 07:00.920
on from several panels that I'm doing at Dragon Con.

07:00.920 --> 07:04.720
So hello, hello to any new listeners and folks that may have discovered this show through

07:04.720 --> 07:05.820
the convention.

07:05.820 --> 07:09.400
It's going to be a little, little different tonight just because we did tape prior.

07:09.400 --> 07:14.120
Usually we do tape live with folks in chat along with our show, we're able to do the

07:14.120 --> 07:15.320
interaction and all that stuff.

07:15.320 --> 07:17.100
We love doing this live.

07:17.100 --> 07:21.880
But we wanted to record this week because if we don't record, then we'll miss two weeks

07:21.880 --> 07:23.880
in a row and that's a long time to be gone.

07:23.880 --> 07:26.760
So it's one thing to miss a Labor Day, but we didn't want to miss two weeks in a row

07:26.760 --> 07:29.520
because I'm leaving really early this year because I'm going to be seeing a buddy of

07:29.520 --> 07:34.080
mine in North Carolina and then making the six hour drive between the two.

07:34.080 --> 07:38.760
But it's like, it's not like the six hour drive from here to LA where it's just like

07:38.760 --> 07:43.560
cows and like dead grass the whole way.

07:43.560 --> 07:47.200
Like I think the drive I'm going to be experiencing will be a lot better looking, at least that's

07:47.200 --> 07:48.200
my hope.

07:48.200 --> 07:49.200
That's my hope.

07:49.200 --> 07:50.200
We'll see.

07:50.200 --> 07:51.720
Well, Darsaka, you're from the South.

07:51.720 --> 07:55.000
Like is it going to be a better road trip in that area you think?

07:55.000 --> 07:58.240
It's going to be tall pine trees the entire way.

07:58.240 --> 07:59.240
I like pine trees.

07:59.240 --> 08:00.240
Okay.

08:00.240 --> 08:01.240
Pine trees are nice.

08:01.240 --> 08:07.960
It'll be very, very pretty at the start and then that'll be all you see.

08:07.960 --> 08:11.320
Well the nice thing is- At least that's what it's like in Alabama.

08:11.320 --> 08:13.920
The nice thing is I get to cross more states off my list.

08:13.920 --> 08:17.760
I won't be going to Alabama, but I get to cross off North Carolina, never been there.

08:17.760 --> 08:20.600
And then we drive through South Carolina on our way to Georgia.

08:20.600 --> 08:24.000
So I'll get to cross off the, obviously I've been to Georgia a million times, thanks to

08:24.000 --> 08:27.620
Dragon Con, but I'll get to cross off the other two Carolinas.

08:27.980 --> 08:29.980
So that'll be good.

08:29.980 --> 08:35.980
And then next year I have Florida that I get to cross off the list because of the crews

08:35.980 --> 08:40.160
are going on in March with the kids from Starboard Power Couplings, that'll be fun.

08:40.160 --> 08:42.920
So anyway, enough about my life.

08:42.920 --> 08:45.260
Let's talk about video games and all that good stuff.

08:45.260 --> 08:48.580
We're going to start off tonight with how is your gaming week and talk about the types

08:48.580 --> 08:51.740
of video games that we have been playing this week.

08:51.740 --> 08:53.020
Darsaka, how was your gaming week?

08:53.020 --> 08:57.460
What have you- I know you had the fall, so maybe not much, but anything to help pass

08:57.500 --> 08:58.500
the time maybe?

08:58.500 --> 09:04.140
Sims, Animal Crossing on the phone, the usual.

09:04.140 --> 09:05.140
More Sims, huh?

09:05.140 --> 09:06.580
How's your family progressing?

09:06.580 --> 09:08.620
Have you killed anyone yet?

09:08.620 --> 09:10.660
I'm actually not playing really any of my families.

09:10.660 --> 09:15.020
I only played like one group long enough for them to have a kid because they should have

09:15.020 --> 09:16.020
a kid.

09:16.020 --> 09:22.700
Because I mean, that's just, it was like an old RP character that I made a Sim for.

09:22.700 --> 09:29.780
And then right now I'm remodeling all of the in-game Sims.

09:29.780 --> 09:32.660
So that's really it.

09:32.660 --> 09:35.820
The Goths right now are on the chopping block.

09:35.820 --> 09:39.060
How many mods do you use with the Sims?

09:39.060 --> 09:42.540
I'll tell you right now, and I'm actually going to be adding some more.

09:42.540 --> 09:47.580
So if I go into my mods folder, because I am actually at my home computer right now.

09:47.580 --> 09:48.580
That's Elder Scrolls.

09:48.580 --> 09:49.580
Oops.

09:49.580 --> 09:56.740
I'm actually, I'm going to probably be waiting, by the way, to do Final Fantasy XIV until

09:56.740 --> 10:02.220
after we split our bills next month, Dan and I are going to be doing that.

10:02.220 --> 10:06.460
So right now I have 17,639 installed and I'm going to be adding a few more.

10:06.460 --> 10:10.780
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, you have 17,000 mods for the Sims?

10:10.780 --> 10:15.980
Well, right, because keep in mind, custom content is all considered a mod.

10:15.980 --> 10:17.660
I think they're talking about like each individual piece.

10:17.740 --> 10:20.940
Oh, so like if it's one shirt, that's a mod.

10:20.940 --> 10:21.940
Exactly.

10:21.940 --> 10:22.940
Oh, okay.

10:22.940 --> 10:25.340
I mean, there are actual game mods.

10:25.340 --> 10:26.340
Okay.

10:26.340 --> 10:34.500
And like, I'm about to install four mods, like actual game mods, but those are scripts

10:34.500 --> 10:39.080
and scripts go into like their own, like it's hard for me to track actually what scripts

10:39.080 --> 10:46.260
I have on there just because, you know, they, goodness, I found some mods in the wrong folder,

10:46.460 --> 10:51.020
but they go in like a different folder and I haven't been through that one to see exactly

10:51.020 --> 10:56.260
how many I have, but I know like I have the, you know, the no mosaic, you know, so I can

10:56.260 --> 10:57.260
have naked Sims.

10:57.260 --> 10:58.260
Okay.

10:58.260 --> 10:59.260
Yeah.

10:59.260 --> 11:03.340
I was going to say, that's the only mod I need is the, the get rid of the blurs.

11:03.340 --> 11:05.940
Isn't the one that makes them do nastier things too.

11:05.940 --> 11:06.940
I'm almost positive.

11:06.940 --> 11:10.260
I've seen a mod where like they do nastier things.

11:10.260 --> 11:11.260
Possibly.

11:11.260 --> 11:17.740
I mean, there's, there's like animation mods for the earlier ones.

11:17.740 --> 11:18.740
Okay.

11:18.740 --> 11:23.140
And I read an art article on Kotaku earlier this week that showed somebody with a large

11:23.140 --> 11:24.140
dildo head.

11:24.140 --> 11:25.740
So apparently there are mods out there like that.

11:25.740 --> 11:26.740
Oh, I'm sure.

11:26.740 --> 11:27.740
Of course there are.

11:27.740 --> 11:28.740
Yeah.

11:28.740 --> 11:29.740
If you can achieve it,

11:29.740 --> 11:38.020
but I mean like you can get scripting mods and what those are, you know, once your, your

11:38.020 --> 11:42.360
game is patched and everything's running fine, you know, there's only like a few things you

11:42.360 --> 11:43.360
need to do.

11:43.360 --> 11:49.420
And, and the company like EA Maxis, they're all like, they're super, like they know exactly

11:49.420 --> 11:50.420
what to do.

11:50.420 --> 11:55.060
You know, so they're perfectly fine with all of this running, you know, they just aren't

11:55.060 --> 12:01.300
responsible for, you know, any of the shenanigans.

12:01.300 --> 12:05.220
Any mod that tries to take your credit card number, shows your children something offensive.

12:05.220 --> 12:09.860
It's like you install that you take the responsibility for that, but surely a company like EA has

12:09.860 --> 12:17.020
to know, like modding is part of the reason why some of their games continue to succeed

12:17.020 --> 12:24.100
for all this time afterwards, you know, because...

12:24.100 --> 12:25.100
Go ahead.

12:25.100 --> 12:26.100
I'm sorry.

12:26.100 --> 12:28.220
One of the mods that I actually, it's a family of mods.

12:28.220 --> 12:32.020
It's called don't wash dishes where you angry poop.

12:32.020 --> 12:33.900
What?

12:33.900 --> 12:41.780
Because you can, you can wash dishes in any sink and there's a habit where like your,

12:41.780 --> 12:50.260
if your sim is closer to like a, a bathroom sink, then they'll try to wash dishes in that

12:50.260 --> 12:51.260
sink.

12:51.260 --> 12:54.380
Oh, I thought it was the other way around.

12:54.380 --> 12:57.700
And there's also a don't prepare food where you angry poop.

12:57.700 --> 12:59.780
I that's what mods called.

12:59.780 --> 13:04.620
I thought you were about to say that if they couldn't find the toilet, they would just

13:04.620 --> 13:07.500
poop in the sink.

13:07.500 --> 13:11.020
And I was like, that's disturbing.

13:11.020 --> 13:15.300
Like how drunk was your sim?

13:15.300 --> 13:23.180
They make outdoor toilets though, that those outdoor toilets count as a bathroom, but you

13:23.180 --> 13:24.780
can place them outside just in nature.

13:24.780 --> 13:27.300
They're basically a giant plant.

13:27.300 --> 13:28.300
All right.

13:28.820 --> 13:32.700
Can you build like in this, I haven't played the Sims really since the first game, but

13:32.700 --> 13:37.700
can you, can you build like outdoor homes, like, like tree houses now with porta potties

13:37.700 --> 13:38.700
and stuff?

13:38.700 --> 13:39.700
Yeah.

13:39.700 --> 13:40.700
You always could do that.

13:40.700 --> 13:47.820
Um, like, um, you know, there's some of the month or not mods, but some of the things

13:47.820 --> 13:55.900
that I'll run are, um, like you can hit like, uh, control and the close bracket and it makes

13:55.940 --> 14:02.780
things bigger and control, uh, open bracket is to make things smaller.

14:02.780 --> 14:03.780
This is on a PC.

14:03.780 --> 14:06.780
Um, cause my Mac doesn't have a big enough hard drive.

14:06.780 --> 14:13.060
Um, but you can make things like huge or small.

14:13.060 --> 14:17.020
And then, you know, there's another, uh, where you can, cause normally it doesn't let you

14:17.020 --> 14:21.740
put things in certain places, but you can tell certain textures to not textures, but

14:21.740 --> 14:25.260
certain objects to overlap.

14:25.260 --> 14:32.060
And then you can, you know, make like, like plants growing out of your wall and like weird

14:32.060 --> 14:33.060
stuff.

14:33.060 --> 14:36.540
I guess that's a way you might decorate your house if you, you know, uh, have a lot of

14:36.540 --> 14:37.540
money.

14:37.540 --> 14:43.260
Uh, but I was going to say about the whole, I was going to say about the whole, um, modding

14:43.260 --> 14:44.260
thing.

14:44.260 --> 14:47.800
Like I'm trying to think like the, the one Sims game I don't think did very well was

14:47.800 --> 14:48.800
the Sims online.

14:48.800 --> 14:50.700
Remember when they tried to do the Sims online?

14:50.700 --> 14:54.260
That one didn't do very well, but probably because you couldn't really mod that one because

14:54.260 --> 14:55.260
it was always online.

14:55.260 --> 14:56.260
Is that the Facebook one?

14:56.260 --> 14:57.260
Yeah, no, no.

14:57.260 --> 15:02.020
There was like, it was them trying to get on the MMO craze.

15:02.020 --> 15:06.700
Like when everything started breaking through like world of Warcraft and, and, uh, uh, EverQuest

15:06.700 --> 15:10.460
and all that stuff, they tried to do their own like MMO and it seemed, you know, it did

15:10.460 --> 15:13.940
seem like a natural progression is that you could build, you know, your own Sims house

15:13.940 --> 15:15.220
with other people.

15:15.220 --> 15:19.940
But apparently the whole thing turned into, I feel like in the early days of OLR, we talked

15:19.940 --> 15:20.940
about this.

15:20.940 --> 15:21.940
That's pretty sure.

15:22.940 --> 15:31.220
But like it just turned into a cesspool of like prostitution, drugs, like everything

15:31.220 --> 15:33.780
that humanity, lawless humanity would turn into.

15:33.780 --> 15:35.260
They built Second Life again.

15:35.260 --> 15:36.260
Yeah, pretty much.

15:36.260 --> 15:37.900
They built Second Life in the Sims online.

15:37.900 --> 15:40.180
And that's why I think they third life.

15:40.180 --> 15:41.180
Third life.

15:41.180 --> 15:42.180
All right.

15:42.180 --> 15:45.660
Darsaga, anything else for your game of the week?

15:45.660 --> 15:46.660
Nah.

15:46.660 --> 15:47.660
All right.

15:47.660 --> 15:49.140
Then we'll move on to Loki.

15:49.140 --> 15:51.380
Hey, we can hear you typing by the way.

15:51.820 --> 15:52.820
So careful.

15:52.820 --> 15:54.100
Uh, Loki, how was your TV week?

15:54.100 --> 15:57.260
I didn't play a thing.

15:57.260 --> 15:58.260
That's right.

15:58.260 --> 15:59.260
Wow.

15:59.260 --> 16:00.420
You've been really great with your track record.

16:00.420 --> 16:04.020
I've been playing no games on this gaming podcast.

16:04.020 --> 16:10.500
No, I have been working on coding and prepping for this coming week, which okay.

16:10.500 --> 16:14.980
It's at least it's like adjacent, you know, you got to code a game to play a game, I guess.

16:14.980 --> 16:20.740
So yeah, so I've been just working on getting stuff ready because I am going to participate

16:20.740 --> 16:22.180
in a game jam next week.

16:22.180 --> 16:23.180
Oh, wow.

16:23.180 --> 16:24.180
Yes.

16:24.180 --> 16:29.380
So I've been getting ready, um, to do that and I'm hoping to stream a lot of it too.

16:29.380 --> 16:30.380
So we'll see.

16:30.380 --> 16:31.380
What's the game jam is.

16:31.380 --> 16:32.380
Oh, it's something you do at your house.

16:32.380 --> 16:35.180
You're not going to go to a, uh, no, not going anywhere.

16:35.180 --> 16:36.180
It's for a week.

16:36.180 --> 16:40.180
And so I have to work in the middle of that as well.

16:40.180 --> 16:43.540
Um, but it's basically, it's a community game jam.

16:43.540 --> 16:47.300
Um, it's a bunch of different YouTubers that are doing, putting it on.

16:47.300 --> 16:52.580
So like some of the other ones I watch for like unity stuff like Braxis or Braxie.

16:52.580 --> 16:54.660
And I don't remember the other guys putting it on here.

16:54.660 --> 16:57.020
So let me just pull this up here real fast.

16:57.020 --> 17:00.360
Um, but it's looks like it's pretty cool.

17:00.360 --> 17:05.460
It's kind of laid back as far as you know what my expectations of it are going to be.

17:05.460 --> 17:08.340
It's not like lunar dare or something like that.

17:08.340 --> 17:09.980
Uh, okay.

17:09.980 --> 17:11.660
So yeah, community game jam.

17:11.660 --> 17:18.660
It's uh, it's IO, um, uh, slash jam slash, uh, C G J.

17:18.660 --> 17:26.300
And it starts on Saturday at noon and it goes until August 31st at noon.

17:26.300 --> 17:30.220
And yeah, so they have, it'd be a good way to spend the downtime with a week, week off

17:30.220 --> 17:31.220
OLR.

17:31.220 --> 17:32.220
Yeah, exactly.

17:32.220 --> 17:36.160
So it'll be interesting to see, you know, what they're gonna, um, what the theme's going

17:36.160 --> 17:37.160
to be.

17:37.160 --> 17:38.740
You're going to let us play whatever you make.

17:38.740 --> 17:39.740
Yeah.

17:39.820 --> 17:45.820
I'm going to, I'm going to release something like, like, um, like they have on shop, you

17:45.820 --> 17:47.460
know, put damn food on the plate.

17:47.460 --> 17:49.100
You got to serve them something.

17:49.100 --> 17:50.100
I like it.

17:50.100 --> 17:51.100
Yes.

17:51.100 --> 17:52.100
Put the, put the food on the plate.

17:52.100 --> 17:53.100
Yeah.

17:53.100 --> 17:57.260
So yeah, it's being put on by a, it's organized by a Blackthorn prod, Braxis, uh, Danny and

17:57.260 --> 18:02.960
Jerry, uh, Jerry's sky, Lou and, uh, some other folks.

18:02.960 --> 18:06.820
So it's a bunch of, it's like a big community of people that do like game development videos

18:06.820 --> 18:07.820
on YouTube.

18:07.900 --> 18:09.500
Is this something we can put on VoG network?

18:09.500 --> 18:12.980
Like some of the, you remember we had that game jam a long time ago and some of those

18:12.980 --> 18:13.980
was, they're still there.

18:13.980 --> 18:16.740
It's some of those winning games or, well, they all won, but the VoG network, we had

18:16.740 --> 18:18.340
some of the games that are playable.

18:18.340 --> 18:21.340
Um, is it something that you can put there or maybe, I don't know.

18:21.340 --> 18:22.340
I, uh, yes.

18:22.340 --> 18:24.820
I mean, those games are there.

18:24.820 --> 18:27.980
You have to talk to Bobby about the technical stuff, but yeah, I mean, I think it's going

18:27.980 --> 18:33.180
to be hosted probably on itch.io, but it should be playable there.

18:33.180 --> 18:35.660
I mean, we can make it available, I'm sure.

18:35.660 --> 18:41.540
So I'm hoping that I can do it all right, but if not, you can watch me fail for a very

18:41.540 --> 18:42.540
long time.

18:42.540 --> 18:44.900
So we've been doing that for 17 years.

18:44.900 --> 18:45.900
Yes, exactly.

18:45.900 --> 18:46.900
So even more.

18:46.900 --> 18:47.900
All right.

18:47.900 --> 18:50.500
No, we're learning opportunity.

18:50.500 --> 18:51.500
That's right.

18:51.500 --> 18:52.500
It's a learning opportunity.

18:52.500 --> 18:53.500
We're rooting for you.

18:53.500 --> 18:54.500
This is good.

18:54.500 --> 18:55.860
This would be a good thing for your kids to see you do when they're getting into pro or

18:55.860 --> 18:57.460
at least Josh is getting into programming.

18:57.460 --> 18:58.460
Yeah, that's cool.

18:58.460 --> 19:02.380
I may take a couple of days off during the week, but you know, you earned more time.

19:02.380 --> 19:03.380
You deserve it.

19:03.380 --> 19:04.380
All right.

19:04.580 --> 19:05.580
My gaming week.

19:05.580 --> 19:09.260
So, um, I've kind of played a lot, I mean, we're, we're an abbreviated week this week

19:09.260 --> 19:12.860
because we're recording a little earlier, but, um, I have still been continuing to play

19:12.860 --> 19:15.300
Final Fantasy 14, doing some of the end game stuff.

19:15.300 --> 19:17.980
Uh, Shane made me do some of the new raids.

19:17.980 --> 19:20.820
So I actually played like w w we live streamed everything.

19:20.820 --> 19:24.020
I've been trying to be really good about doing more live streaming on my personal channel

19:24.020 --> 19:25.120
at Rob Roberts.

19:25.120 --> 19:29.100
So, um, I played some Final Fantasy 14 with Shane the other night and probably the other

19:29.100 --> 19:32.340
game I played, that's a little newer, at least new to me.

19:32.380 --> 19:36.420
I played No Man's Sky on PC because remember I bought the PC version.

19:36.420 --> 19:37.420
I bought it.

19:37.420 --> 19:39.660
I haven't installed it yet, but I did buy it.

19:39.660 --> 19:43.140
You double dipped, Bobby Blackwolf double dipped, like everybody's double dipping on

19:43.140 --> 19:44.140
No Man's Sky now.

19:44.140 --> 19:45.140
It's great.

19:45.140 --> 19:46.140
Because mods.

19:46.140 --> 19:47.140
Not yet.

19:47.140 --> 19:52.160
Nope, it's not going to happen because it's easier for me to play on my computer than

19:52.160 --> 19:54.380
with a controller.

19:54.380 --> 19:55.380
That's yeah.

19:55.380 --> 20:00.420
I, I kind of just wish I'd bought it on PC the first time, but I mean, it was a couple

20:00.420 --> 20:01.420
of years.

20:01.500 --> 20:02.820
It was originally a PlayStation four game.

20:02.820 --> 20:05.300
So I mean, that wasn't exactly possible.

20:05.300 --> 20:09.260
So, but like obviously with PC, I can play in 2k mode.

20:09.260 --> 20:14.920
I have to really dumb down the graphics, especially if I'm streaming, but like it's, it's doable,

20:14.920 --> 20:15.920
you know?

20:15.920 --> 20:17.260
So that's, that's pretty cool.

20:17.260 --> 20:18.260
All right.

20:18.260 --> 20:20.240
And Mr. Smoosh is getting up on the soundboard.

20:20.240 --> 20:21.240
That's a big no-no.

20:21.240 --> 20:28.300
Loki buy me time or somebody that cat, I swear to God, it just is causing all sorts of trouble.

20:28.300 --> 20:30.300
All because I didn't share the chicken with you.

20:30.300 --> 20:31.300
Too bad.

20:31.300 --> 20:32.300
I don't know.

20:32.300 --> 20:33.300
Who does he think he is?

20:33.300 --> 20:37.940
I finally heard back from discord by the way.

20:37.940 --> 20:39.740
Gonna change all the switches and all that stuff.

20:39.740 --> 20:42.020
Oh, cause you got locked out of your other account, right?

20:42.020 --> 20:43.020
Yeah.

20:43.020 --> 20:44.980
So I have to delete my account and remake it.

20:44.980 --> 20:46.260
Ah, what a pain.

20:46.260 --> 20:47.260
All right.

20:47.260 --> 20:49.180
Well, you're still with us at least here tonight.

20:49.180 --> 20:51.700
So no man's sky, no man's sky on PC.

20:51.700 --> 20:52.700
It's it's prettier.

20:52.700 --> 20:56.580
Um, although obviously I have to like, especially if I'm streaming, I have to turn the graphics

20:56.580 --> 20:59.380
way down or else like my computer's just like help.

20:59.380 --> 21:03.540
Um, but when I'm not streaming, like it's, it's very lovely to look at.

21:03.540 --> 21:06.940
Uh, the first planet I started on was some ice planet.

21:06.940 --> 21:11.620
Like it was really, it was a really horrible place, but what I did, I rolled straight into

21:11.620 --> 21:13.400
Alan's universe.

21:13.400 --> 21:18.980
So like I joined his game, so it's put me on a planet in the system he was already in.

21:18.980 --> 21:23.500
So I started there and we kind of noticed, and I think Bobby was there cause I was streaming

21:23.500 --> 21:26.700
it live and he talked about how some of it is kind of scripted in the beginning.

21:26.700 --> 21:30.900
Like you always, you know, at a certain time get like a severe storm that comes through

21:30.900 --> 21:34.020
because it's teaching you how to replenish your life supply, you know, and there's certain

21:34.020 --> 21:36.900
things that are like scripted to happen at the beginning, no matter what planet you're

21:36.900 --> 21:37.900
on.

21:37.900 --> 21:38.900
So it's kind of interesting to see.

21:38.900 --> 21:42.420
Cause like, uh, when Alan came to the planet, he's like, I don't see this stuff because

21:42.420 --> 21:45.260
you're being scripted through all this stuff right now.

21:45.260 --> 21:46.820
Ah, so yeah.

21:46.820 --> 21:48.820
So I guess maybe Alan was saying a lot of that.

21:49.300 --> 21:54.900
But then eventually I made my way to the moon of that planet, which was lovely.

21:54.900 --> 21:58.500
It was like one of those like purple grass planets and very serene.

21:58.500 --> 21:59.620
It was very nice.

21:59.620 --> 22:01.600
And that's where Alan's base is.

22:01.600 --> 22:06.560
So I started a base, like I couldn't build right near his, but I was able to build like

22:06.560 --> 22:08.400
on the other side of the mountain from it.

22:08.400 --> 22:11.540
So now we have bases right near each other, but it won't let me upload it cause it says

22:11.540 --> 22:12.860
it's too small.

22:12.860 --> 22:16.780
So I have to expand it a little more still and then I should be able to upload it and

22:16.780 --> 22:19.100
more people I guess could visit it if they wanted to.

22:19.100 --> 22:23.220
But sadly I probably won't get a lot more time with No Man's Sky until after I'm back

22:23.220 --> 22:24.220
for my trip.

22:24.220 --> 22:27.340
But, uh, I was, you know, enjoying the experience on, on PC.

22:27.340 --> 22:30.260
It's just getting used to the different controls was the hardest part.

22:30.260 --> 22:35.620
Cause it's like all these keys like Q, W, E, R, you know, they're all mapped to different

22:35.620 --> 22:36.620
things.

22:36.620 --> 22:38.980
And so like, I'm not, Oh, I'm just going to play the controller.

22:38.980 --> 22:42.140
So that'll, my brain wasn't used to, yeah, I guess I could just plug in my Xbox controller

22:42.140 --> 22:43.700
or your PlayStation four controller.

22:43.700 --> 22:44.700
I guess that's true.

22:44.700 --> 22:45.700
I should just play with the controller.

22:45.700 --> 22:48.100
That would make it a lot easier, but that's, that's okay.

22:48.100 --> 22:51.780
I don't, you know, there is something about using the mouse to aim that I enjoy and all

22:51.780 --> 22:52.780
that stuff.

22:52.780 --> 22:53.780
So that is, that is nice.

22:53.780 --> 22:57.060
So, um, yeah, that's pretty much been my gaming week.

22:57.060 --> 22:58.340
I don't think a lot else to share.

22:58.340 --> 23:01.060
Cause I talked about VR on No Man's Sky last week.

23:01.060 --> 23:02.060
I'm pretty sure.

23:02.060 --> 23:04.220
So I don't need to cover that again.

23:04.220 --> 23:09.260
So, uh, we will move on with the program and in our next segment, we're gonna do something

23:09.260 --> 23:11.940
a little special, a little different here tonight.

23:11.940 --> 23:15.660
Something we, um, don't usually have as a segment in the show, but maybe we ought to

23:15.660 --> 23:19.500
bring it back because we got a lot of great feedback this week.

23:19.500 --> 23:23.140
Uh, what we wanted to invite with some of your questions and some of your discussion

23:23.140 --> 23:25.580
drivers this week on Twitter.

23:25.580 --> 23:29.940
So over at our Twitter account, uh, OLR, we asked a question this week.

23:29.940 --> 23:32.840
We asked everybody to, uh, uh, answer the following.

23:32.840 --> 23:38.380
We said on a special recorded OLR this week, we want to invite your questions for our hosts

23:38.380 --> 23:42.780
on gaming, on podcasting or anything reasonable you might have.

23:42.780 --> 23:45.960
So we got quite a few responses.

23:45.960 --> 23:48.540
So we have a few questions and discussion topics for tonight.

23:48.540 --> 23:49.540
So y'all ready?

23:49.540 --> 23:52.620
You're ready for Ask Orange Lounge via Twitter?

23:52.620 --> 23:53.620
Yes.

23:53.620 --> 23:55.700
All right, let's do it.

23:55.700 --> 24:00.060
Uh, first off tonight, our pal Flaco Jones.

24:00.060 --> 24:01.060
Flaco Jones.

24:01.060 --> 24:03.420
So I've seen, been doing a lot of streaming very late at night.

24:03.420 --> 24:07.320
Uh, last, the other night he was playing some Paladins, I think, but hopefully that's all

24:07.320 --> 24:08.560
going well for him.

24:08.560 --> 24:14.260
So Flaco Jones starts us off saying, I know Loki was having Joy-Con drift.

24:14.260 --> 24:20.220
Has he or any of the other hosts taken advantage of Nintendo's free repair for the issue?

24:20.220 --> 24:25.960
I sent mine in and they took care of them quickly and at no charge plus free shipping.

24:25.960 --> 24:28.720
So I haven't took advantage of the whole, I haven't yet.

24:28.720 --> 24:35.240
Um, and I want to, I just haven't done it yet, but I need to do both sets, both Joy-Cons,

24:35.240 --> 24:37.280
but I'll have to do one at a time.

24:37.280 --> 24:39.860
And it's one of those things where they're going to be missing for a while while they're

24:39.860 --> 24:40.860
getting repaired.

24:40.860 --> 24:41.860
That's why I have two sets.

24:41.860 --> 24:46.660
So like, so I would do one, have it repaired, it comes back and then do the second one.

24:46.660 --> 24:50.500
But that's less bad because I only have the one set, but I was gonna say, I'm not having

24:50.500 --> 24:55.500
the problems you guys are having, but admittedly mine gets less traffic.

24:55.500 --> 24:59.500
I don't have the kid factor either, which I'm sure, you know, they tend to, you know,

24:59.500 --> 25:01.700
put a little more wear and tear on them.

25:01.700 --> 25:06.620
Um, and uh, yeah, so they haven't really been an issue for me yet, but I'm glad Nintendo

25:06.620 --> 25:08.760
kind of, kind of came around on the program.

25:08.760 --> 25:11.560
I, well, I think they were kind of forced to, or else they were going to be looking

25:11.560 --> 25:13.200
at a class action lawsuit type of thing.

25:13.200 --> 25:17.800
So I think they were kind of putting a quarter on that, having to do the warranty thing.

25:17.800 --> 25:21.760
Uh, Dark Sakura, you, you haven't had a problem with your Switch at all, right?

25:21.760 --> 25:24.200
So you're, you probably haven't taken advantage of this either, right?

25:24.200 --> 25:26.880
Honestly, it's our Pro Controller that had more problems.

25:26.880 --> 25:28.400
It's got some input lag in it.

25:28.400 --> 25:30.240
I think just our model.

25:30.240 --> 25:31.240
Interesting.

25:31.240 --> 25:36.600
So the Pro Controller having issues, but they, it's not, it's just input lag.

25:36.600 --> 25:41.580
And it had a little bit of drift on it too, but I haven't seen anything going on for

25:41.580 --> 25:42.580
the Pro Controller.

25:42.580 --> 25:44.260
So we have nothing to take advantage of.

25:44.260 --> 25:45.260
Yeah, I know.

25:45.260 --> 25:47.380
I was gonna say, I don't think that's part of the program yet.

25:47.380 --> 25:50.460
Who knows if there's enough of those problems out there, who knows what'll happen?

25:50.460 --> 25:53.140
Well, Dark Sakura, I bet this next question will be up your alley.

25:53.140 --> 26:00.660
So our next tweet tonight is from Rettertainment who says, I have a Sega Saturn and one game

26:00.660 --> 26:02.340
missed.

26:02.340 --> 26:04.900
I've been thinking of getting another game.

26:04.900 --> 26:07.900
What should I keep my eye out for?

26:07.900 --> 26:09.840
What shouldn't you keep your eye out for?

26:09.840 --> 26:11.920
Is it a US?

26:11.920 --> 26:14.160
It's a US one, right?

26:14.160 --> 26:17.880
It was not specified, so we're going to assume a US one.

26:17.880 --> 26:18.880
Okay.

26:18.880 --> 26:26.080
So US games, of course there's, if you're into fighting games, any of the Street Fighter,

26:26.080 --> 26:30.040
King of Fighters, you know, those are all, well, actually the King of Fighters games

26:30.040 --> 26:32.080
require the RAM cartridge.

26:32.100 --> 26:41.100
So I would say, basically like Street Fighter Alpha 2, the first Street Fighter Alpha, if

26:41.100 --> 26:48.180
you can get any of like the Sega Aegis stuff, those are pretty good.

26:48.180 --> 26:49.660
There weren't too many of them that came out in the US.

26:49.660 --> 26:56.440
Of course you want to have Knights, you want to have, gosh, I'm trying to think what else

26:56.440 --> 26:58.860
is like, I'd have to go look at the vault now.

26:58.860 --> 27:01.640
The Panzer Dragoon Zwee?

27:01.640 --> 27:09.520
Panzer Dragoon Saga, actually it's expensive, but absolutely worth it.

27:09.520 --> 27:13.120
We got ours like really cheap too, but yeah, the Panzer Dragoon games are worth it.

27:13.120 --> 27:17.240
I mean, they're not like my absolute favorites, but they're good games.

27:17.240 --> 27:21.480
Is the Sega Saturn hard to mod to play import games?

27:21.480 --> 27:25.720
If you want to ask, you will have to ask your husband about that because I've never done

27:25.720 --> 27:26.720
it.

27:26.720 --> 27:27.720
Oh really?

27:27.720 --> 27:34.220
I didn't even know Alan modded Sega Saturns, what?

27:34.220 --> 27:38.020
I think we had his modded Sega Saturn for like a hot minute.

27:38.020 --> 27:42.020
Honestly, it doesn't surprise me though, Alan was a Sega guy for a long time, so it doesn't

27:42.020 --> 27:44.860
like surprise me, but it's just kind of funny.

27:44.860 --> 27:51.500
I would have thought that you and Dan would have had the lock on that.

27:51.500 --> 27:56.860
We had converter cartridges, so that's what we did.

27:56.860 --> 27:57.860
Gotcha.

27:57.860 --> 28:02.200
No, and the Saturn was one of those platforms I kind of missed out on, like I didn't catch

28:02.200 --> 28:06.360
up with Sega really until like the Dreamcast, so all my Sega memories are with that, so

28:06.360 --> 28:09.700
I don't have a lot to recommend.

28:09.700 --> 28:12.320
I would have said the big stuff like Knights as well.

28:12.320 --> 28:17.560
Well, like how you see, this was back in the days when I used to rent consoles from Blockbuster

28:17.560 --> 28:22.220
because I didn't buy a Sega Saturn until much later, but I used to rent it with a stall.

28:22.220 --> 28:25.400
That was another one of the games I liked in Clockwork Knight.

28:25.400 --> 28:28.260
A stall was pretty good, but awfully slow.

28:28.260 --> 28:30.500
Yeah, but it's pretty.

28:30.500 --> 28:32.780
It had great music.

28:32.780 --> 28:38.460
I find that interesting that of all the games in the world for the Sega Saturn, Retertainment

28:38.460 --> 28:43.420
has missed, but I'm going to assume maybe it was like included or like a really good

28:43.420 --> 28:46.980
deal because he doesn't say where the Sega Saturn came from, like if it was given to

28:46.980 --> 28:50.660
him or if he found out like a flea market garage sale type of thing or what.

28:50.660 --> 28:56.160
Yeah, so it's just interesting that of all the games, I mean, I'm not knocking missed.

28:56.160 --> 29:00.160
Missed isn't a bad game, but I don't associate missed with the Saturn nearly as much as I

29:00.160 --> 29:06.920
do like old MS-DOS PC because like that, you know, I feel like missed was only ported to

29:06.920 --> 29:12.440
like the Saturn and all those consoles because of how it was performing on the PC, you know?

29:12.440 --> 29:13.440
Yeah.

29:13.440 --> 29:14.440
Anyway.

29:14.440 --> 29:15.720
All right, let's move on.

29:15.720 --> 29:18.160
Now we're getting into some deeper questions too.

29:18.160 --> 29:19.160
This is good.

29:19.160 --> 29:25.860
So Elliot Bentley, Elliot underscore Bentley sent us a tweet saying, what games have changed

29:25.860 --> 29:28.340
the way you think of a certain genre?

29:28.340 --> 29:30.680
It's a really good question.

29:30.680 --> 29:34.140
What games have changed the way you think of a certain genre?

29:34.140 --> 29:37.540
And even though I know we're not live tonight, I'm going to look through chat when this is

29:37.540 --> 29:38.540
all done.

29:38.540 --> 29:41.140
So I would be very curious because this is one I could see a lot of different answers

29:41.140 --> 29:42.140
for.

29:42.140 --> 29:45.340
Maybe we'll go back and read some of your answers next week, but anyway, or in two weeks

29:45.340 --> 29:46.340
when we come back.

29:46.340 --> 29:47.340
But here's an example.

29:47.520 --> 29:49.640
B continues his tweet here.

29:49.640 --> 29:51.000
Here's an example.

29:51.000 --> 29:57.360
Since playing Breath of the Wild, I'm hyper aware of the way many open world games rely

29:57.360 --> 30:04.360
on maps filled with icons and arrows pointing directly to your next destination.

30:04.360 --> 30:07.720
So what games have changed the way you think of a certain genre?

30:07.720 --> 30:12.160
So he's basically saying that like, because of the Breath of the Wild, like, oh, it made

30:12.160 --> 30:15.880
me realize like all these open world games kind of have some of these like kind of base

30:15.880 --> 30:18.220
elements that are very similar.

30:18.220 --> 30:21.260
So what game changed the way you think of a certain genre?

30:21.260 --> 30:22.980
None really.

30:22.980 --> 30:28.220
I mean, I've always, I don't really look at games per genre really.

30:28.220 --> 30:33.100
I look at every game to me is a different and unique experience.

30:33.100 --> 30:37.300
So I wouldn't say that anything's changed the way I think about it because I go into

30:37.300 --> 30:39.860
every game as their own experience.

30:39.860 --> 30:41.860
That's just how I am.

30:41.860 --> 30:42.860
That's fair.

30:42.860 --> 30:47.200
Okay, so like an answer that comes to my mind is a game that we've stand forever on Orange

30:47.200 --> 30:51.600
Ons Radio, which I bet a lot of you guys maybe haven't played yet, but you need to go find

30:51.600 --> 30:55.220
a way to play this game, even if illegally, like I'm just going to be real, find the ROM

30:55.220 --> 30:56.220
and download it.

30:56.220 --> 30:59.880
Because if we've been robbed of this game for all these years, like they just they're

30:59.880 --> 31:01.920
never going to put it out for you to get legally.

31:01.920 --> 31:03.760
So you should just get it illegally at this point.

31:03.760 --> 31:04.760
Sorry, not sorry.

31:04.760 --> 31:09.420
And that is the Guardian Legend because my answer is like the Guardian Legend because

31:09.420 --> 31:16.000
of the way it fused, like shooter and like overworld action, like the Zelda kind of element,

31:16.000 --> 31:21.200
like I would say like the Guardian Legend really made me rethink the shooter genre,

31:21.200 --> 31:26.880
because it was like it added this much deeper layer to it, where that the adventuring that

31:26.880 --> 31:33.260
you were doing around the world was affecting, you know, what you did in the shooting part,

31:33.260 --> 31:37.040
you know, and like it was it was a different type of shooter to like, I like the way the

31:37.040 --> 31:39.260
two sides influenced each other.

31:39.260 --> 31:43.320
And I think those type of mishmash genre games are going to always be the ones that come

31:43.320 --> 31:47.600
to mind because you know, another one from back in the day, you ready for another obscure

31:47.600 --> 31:49.240
NES title?

31:49.240 --> 31:51.600
This was another genre fusing game.

31:51.600 --> 31:58.040
And it fused again, like your Zelda type of overworld with a more traditional RPG.

31:58.040 --> 31:59.680
And that is Magic of Scheherazade.

31:59.680 --> 32:03.800
I don't know if you've ever played, have you ever played Magic of Scheherazade?

32:03.800 --> 32:05.160
Like briefly?

32:05.160 --> 32:06.160
Yeah.

32:06.460 --> 32:11.020
You know, some of it, it's a little clunky in parts, because I think it's very ambitious

32:11.020 --> 32:13.040
what they were trying to do with that game.

32:13.040 --> 32:18.460
And I think that game in some ways makes you rethink RPGs.

32:18.460 --> 32:19.940
I don't know, I could probably come up with more.

32:19.940 --> 32:22.740
I don't know if you guys have anything to add to this.

32:22.740 --> 32:28.160
Grant the thought of five and the amount of detail that developers can put into a game,

32:28.160 --> 32:32.760
like the ridiculous amount of details that they have in there, like with pant legs getting

32:32.820 --> 32:38.600
wet up to this point where they get into the water or like just all sorts of weird stuff,

32:38.600 --> 32:45.140
flip flops flopping and just the animals and there's all sorts of like crazy details that

32:45.140 --> 32:46.140
are in that.

32:46.140 --> 32:52.260
So kind of like environmental, the environmental impact, not like climate change type of discussion,

32:52.260 --> 32:58.740
but more like the environment, you know, physics and awareness with an action game, which is

32:58.740 --> 33:03.040
interesting because you could also think like crackdown where you kind of take traditional

33:03.040 --> 33:05.040
physics and kind of turn it on its head a little bit.

33:05.040 --> 33:06.040
Yeah.

33:06.040 --> 33:07.040
Way.

33:07.040 --> 33:10.020
I think crackdown is kind of a genre bending game a little bit, a little bit because it

33:10.020 --> 33:14.560
took the grand theft auto-esque type overworld mechanic, but made it like, but what if you

33:14.560 --> 33:17.280
had anti-gravity boots type of things?

33:17.280 --> 33:21.300
What if, you know, you could do all these different things or you could take the open

33:21.300 --> 33:26.040
world grand theft auto type genre and what they did with like driver three and how your

33:26.040 --> 33:27.400
game is so fucking buggy.

33:27.400 --> 33:30.260
It just ignores a lot of the rules.

33:30.260 --> 33:33.340
I love driver three because it was so terrible.

33:33.340 --> 33:34.340
It was fun.

33:34.340 --> 33:38.580
Are there other games maybe in that category, like a game that was so fucking bad, it made

33:38.580 --> 33:43.820
you kind of rethink the genre a little bit, but it's like kind of fun in a charming way.

33:43.820 --> 33:47.260
So bad spice world and music games.

33:47.260 --> 33:49.300
Oh God.

33:49.300 --> 33:50.300
That's right.

33:50.300 --> 33:51.300
On the PlayStation one.

33:51.300 --> 33:55.740
Let's put another girl through her paces spice world on PlayStation.

33:56.160 --> 33:59.280
Totally not something that a pimp would say.

33:59.280 --> 34:04.680
I was thinking in terms of open world though, going back to that, I mean Minecraft was pretty,

34:04.680 --> 34:05.680
pretty crazy.

34:05.680 --> 34:06.680
Oh, good call.

34:06.680 --> 34:07.760
When it was new.

34:07.760 --> 34:08.760
Good call.

34:08.760 --> 34:12.920
Like a game that's open world, but it's your world.

34:12.920 --> 34:14.160
Yeah.

34:14.160 --> 34:18.200
That's definitely genre defined or like genre bending for sure.

34:18.740 --> 34:25.540
But I'm not saying that anything really like, it's just that I don't look at the impact

34:25.540 --> 34:26.540
like that.

34:26.540 --> 34:27.540
Does that make sense?

34:27.540 --> 34:31.060
Yeah, no, that's, that's why I kind of like a question like that because it does make

34:31.060 --> 34:32.900
us kind of take a step back and go, huh.

34:32.900 --> 34:36.540
I wonder what game has made me kind of like no man's sky.

34:36.540 --> 34:40.740
Like how everything is procedural is kind of ridiculous.

34:40.740 --> 34:44.300
That's another, that's another different type of like open worlds type of thing where what

34:44.300 --> 34:47.340
if the world is just completely generated.

34:47.360 --> 34:50.920
Or borderlands with the billions of guns that they have.

34:50.920 --> 34:51.920
You know what though?

34:51.920 --> 34:55.840
You know what though would be in a similar bucket with no man's sky would be, um, elder

34:55.840 --> 34:59.700
scrolls two.

34:59.700 --> 35:03.000
Was that the one that had the procedurally generated, like all the caves and everything?

35:03.000 --> 35:04.320
Like they didn't go in there and design it.

35:04.320 --> 35:07.680
Everything was like generated basically because the world was so fricking huge.

35:07.680 --> 35:08.680
I think it was two.

35:08.680 --> 35:09.720
It was either two or three.

35:09.720 --> 35:11.120
I don't think, I don't think it was Morrowind though.

35:11.120 --> 35:12.120
I think it was the second game.

35:12.120 --> 35:13.120
I think it was, yeah.

35:13.120 --> 35:14.120
The first one's arena.

35:14.120 --> 35:15.120
The second one's blades.

35:15.120 --> 35:16.120
Right.

35:16.120 --> 35:17.120
I think it was that one.

35:17.900 --> 35:19.900
Anyway, food for thought.

35:19.900 --> 35:24.140
Anyway, I'm excited to see chat's answers on that too, and maybe some more tweets on

35:24.140 --> 35:25.140
that, but great question.

35:25.140 --> 35:26.140
Okay.

35:26.140 --> 35:31.820
So our next tweet, as we get to some more listener questions tonight for our show, comes

35:31.820 --> 35:36.460
from SSJ100 Matt who says, it's a three, it's a three part question.

35:36.460 --> 35:37.460
You ready?

35:37.460 --> 35:38.460
So here we go.

35:38.460 --> 35:39.460
Part one.

35:39.460 --> 35:45.420
Besides wearing pants, what has been the biggest challenge and adjustment you've all had to

35:45.420 --> 35:50.400
make now that the show has a video aspect to it?

35:50.400 --> 35:51.400
What's the big...

35:51.400 --> 35:52.400
Wearing pants.

35:52.400 --> 35:53.400
Kidding.

35:53.400 --> 35:54.400
I, come on.

35:54.400 --> 35:56.880
We all wore pants before because we were all in the same room.

35:56.880 --> 35:57.880
Although...

35:57.880 --> 35:58.880
Uh-uh.

35:58.880 --> 35:59.880
Sometimes I wore a skirt.

35:59.880 --> 36:00.880
I, yeah.

36:00.880 --> 36:04.640
Well, and I was going to say, sometimes I'd be lazy and wear gym shorts, you know, and

36:04.640 --> 36:07.400
like, I wouldn't bother to do my hair or wear a hat.

36:07.400 --> 36:11.300
I just would look like shit because I'm like, well, nobody's going to see me, but Loki and

36:11.300 --> 36:12.800
Dark Soccer, and they've known me forever.

36:12.800 --> 36:14.320
They've seen me at my absolute worst.

36:14.320 --> 36:15.320
So whatever.

36:15.320 --> 36:16.900
Like you do think about that a little bit.

36:16.900 --> 36:20.540
I definitely, I do have to think a little bit about like what I'm going to wear.

36:20.540 --> 36:23.880
Like what's going to be like, and even to the point where I'm like, oh, I'm wearing

36:23.880 --> 36:28.080
this cruel intention shirt that I got at Target on the stream tonight.

36:28.080 --> 36:31.700
And I'm like, um, I think I wore this on the show like three weeks ago and I kind of like

36:31.700 --> 36:35.100
didn't want to repeat it, but I was like, at the same time, it's like, you know, like

36:35.100 --> 36:38.620
I kind of get into that mode where it's like, oh, I don't necessarily want to repeat outfits

36:38.620 --> 36:43.740
either, but like, it's, it's just, you don't buy shirts to wear once and throw them away.

36:43.760 --> 36:46.400
Like I, we don't live that kind of lifestyle.

36:46.400 --> 36:50.600
It's hard to decide where to look because I have to look at the camera, talk to the

36:50.600 --> 36:56.400
audience, look at Rob, it's like, ah, that is huge.

36:56.400 --> 37:00.640
That is the biggest challenge because I remember after the first episode, uh, the first piece

37:00.640 --> 37:05.320
of feedback I got from a friend was that like, you guys don't even look at each other when

37:05.320 --> 37:06.760
you're doing the show.

37:06.760 --> 37:11.480
And I'm like, no, we really don't like, because when it's a radio show, you don't see that.

37:11.500 --> 37:13.620
And he's like, you guys are like always buried in your computers.

37:13.620 --> 37:17.180
Like, and I'm like, well, we're pulling up the next story and you know, whatever.

37:17.180 --> 37:18.540
He's like, you're on your phone half the time.

37:18.540 --> 37:20.820
I'm like, well, I'm multitasking.

37:20.820 --> 37:23.300
Well those Pokemon are going to catch themselves.

37:23.300 --> 37:27.900
So, you know, so I would say that has been a big change is that we have to be aware,

37:27.900 --> 37:34.140
you know, I mean, yeah, we said in the very beginning, we're still doing an audio podcast.

37:34.140 --> 37:36.360
It's just the delivery method is different.

37:36.360 --> 37:38.740
So we're not going to like turn it upside down for Twitch.

37:38.740 --> 37:40.420
We're not suddenly doing orange launch video.

37:40.560 --> 37:45.160
It is still orange launch radio, but certainly I don't want it to like look terrible.

37:45.160 --> 37:48.800
So I think, you know, some of that feedback was still very right on is that, okay, I need

37:48.800 --> 37:53.080
to not be on my phone unless it's like, you know, unless I'm bringing up tweets to talk

37:53.080 --> 37:57.160
about on air or, you know, I need to try to like actually look at Loki or Dark Sakura,

37:57.160 --> 38:01.600
which is here talking or the camera, you know, instead of like looking, you know, or like

38:01.600 --> 38:05.280
taking a nap or like, I'm just going to rest my eyes while Loki does the next story.

38:05.280 --> 38:07.320
Like, I can't really do that anymore.

38:07.320 --> 38:08.320
You know?

38:08.320 --> 38:11.060
I think that was a big change.

38:11.060 --> 38:13.060
Anything for you, Dark Sakura?

38:13.060 --> 38:14.060
No.

38:14.060 --> 38:18.300
But you also, you tend to sit off cam too.

38:18.300 --> 38:19.300
Yeah.

38:19.300 --> 38:21.700
So it's not really super crazy for me.

38:21.700 --> 38:24.900
I'm just doing my, my huge.

38:24.900 --> 38:25.900
Yep.

38:25.900 --> 38:32.380
Number two, what has been your favorite part about adding video to the show?

38:32.380 --> 38:44.600
I couldn't say, I'll be honest, I kind of don't feel one way or another about it.

38:44.600 --> 38:45.960
That's fair.

38:45.960 --> 38:51.080
It's the, obviously the pre-show things that we have are hilarious.

38:51.080 --> 38:53.800
The little bumpers that Jason and I do.

38:53.800 --> 38:54.800
Yeah.

38:54.800 --> 38:55.800
Yes.

38:55.800 --> 38:56.800
Yeah.

38:56.800 --> 38:57.800
Those are fun to do.

38:57.800 --> 38:58.800
It's a little, little extra thing.

38:58.800 --> 39:03.340
I would say, and you know, uh, when it's utilized, it's wonderful.

39:03.340 --> 39:07.780
It's not, you know, I don't expect everything on this show is going to get clipped, but

39:07.780 --> 39:09.980
I love the clip thing.

39:09.980 --> 39:14.420
Like when we do have those random things that happen, we're like, let's say Mr. Smoosh makes

39:14.420 --> 39:17.260
an appearance on cam or something and people, you know, want to see that.

39:17.260 --> 39:18.620
So the clip happens.

39:18.620 --> 39:22.100
But then the nice thing about the clipping is that then people who let's say they do

39:22.100 --> 39:26.860
only listen to the audio podcast, but they heard that this funny thing was happening.

39:26.860 --> 39:28.300
Somebody probably clipped it.

39:28.300 --> 39:31.840
And so they can go onto the Twitch channel, you know, even though you have to be a subscriber

39:31.840 --> 39:35.240
to see the full video archive, you don't have the clips are free.

39:35.240 --> 39:38.620
So when people do clip things, you can just watch those whenever.

39:38.620 --> 39:42.240
So I think for me, that's been my favorite part is the clip.

39:42.240 --> 39:47.200
I think that's more of a, a nature of moving to Twitch specifically, cause like, you don't,

39:47.200 --> 39:49.680
you can't clip on mixer or YouTube.

39:49.680 --> 39:54.600
So then it is maybe video, but that's the best answer I got for your question.

39:54.600 --> 40:00.140
Number three, what video improvements would you like to make or see happen?

40:00.140 --> 40:01.660
More flashy effects.

40:01.660 --> 40:05.640
I, I am going to make it a goal that when we come back from dragon con, we're going

40:05.640 --> 40:09.860
to have some transitional bumpers because you guys will probably notice like our music

40:09.860 --> 40:11.920
has been missing for a long time, right?

40:11.920 --> 40:15.580
Like when we do the classic game of the week, we don't get the little doo doo doo doo doo

40:15.580 --> 40:18.700
doo doo doo doo like the DDR Oha stop music that we were using forever.

40:18.700 --> 40:23.220
We don't have that anymore, but I actually do want to bring those back with video bumpers.

40:23.220 --> 40:27.960
So I'm trying to teach myself a new program to do those types of like animated bumpers

40:27.960 --> 40:31.680
and hopefully those will come back soon, but don't hold me to it, but it's a goal for after

40:31.680 --> 40:37.120
dragon con and maybe multiple camera angles and only because there was, was it that one

40:37.120 --> 40:42.080
Twitch streamer on Twitter that we saw, Oh God, she's so funny.

40:42.080 --> 40:43.080
Oh my God.

40:43.080 --> 40:44.080
What is her name?

40:44.080 --> 40:49.240
I followed her because when she reads these guys, cause trash bags will come into our

40:49.240 --> 40:54.800
chat and say that, that kind of dumb shit that, you know, mouth breathers will say to

40:54.800 --> 40:58.900
girl streamers and she will drag them through the mud.

40:58.900 --> 40:59.900
It's pretty hilarious.

40:59.900 --> 41:01.860
This is her multiple camera angles to do it.

41:01.860 --> 41:02.860
Paladin Amber.

41:02.860 --> 41:04.220
Shout out to Paladin Amber.

41:04.220 --> 41:05.260
She doesn't need a shout out from us.

41:05.260 --> 41:08.980
She's got 354 people watching her stream playing Minecraft right now.

41:08.980 --> 41:12.660
She probably doesn't need our help, but I think she is hilarious and it's because of

41:12.660 --> 41:18.340
clips that I got to, yeah, so yeah, the multiple camera angle stuff that that'd be great.

41:18.340 --> 41:22.680
For me, like the number one thing I want to do, I want to change the whole layout.

41:22.680 --> 41:27.560
Like like we had, we kind of took our old radio layout and just kind of made some small

41:27.560 --> 41:29.680
adjustments, make it work for video.

41:29.680 --> 41:34.320
There is a very good chance in the next year or so that the studio is going to move again.

41:34.320 --> 41:39.120
Alan and I are looking at potentially moving again and next time the next space will be

41:39.120 --> 41:42.500
designed with video in mind.

41:42.500 --> 41:46.840
And I think that will go a long way in how this show is presented.

41:46.840 --> 41:55.300
And someday, someday in the far future, we will have an orange lounge and actually, yes,

41:55.300 --> 41:59.140
maybe perhaps, maybe after all that time, I'll get an orange cover for you to cover.

41:59.140 --> 42:00.140
There you go.

42:00.140 --> 42:01.140
You have our fricking orange lounge.

42:01.140 --> 42:06.260
Um, I dark soccer, I know you're not as invested in the video part of it, but do you have something

42:06.260 --> 42:08.740
that you think is an improvement you'd like to see happen?

42:08.740 --> 42:11.100
Um, no, no, really.

42:11.100 --> 42:13.540
I mean, so far things are pretty good.

42:13.540 --> 42:16.620
I mean, I like the creative way things have been going.

42:16.620 --> 42:18.000
I think it's actually pretty fun.

42:18.000 --> 42:23.920
So, and then I get to randomly just put stuff up on the camera and do randomly, you know?

42:23.920 --> 42:24.920
Yeah.

42:24.920 --> 42:28.800
I think all of us had some app, some apprehensions in one way or another about the change because,

42:28.800 --> 42:30.960
you know, change is scary.

42:30.960 --> 42:34.560
The shout cast was comfortable, you know, it was gonna be sure for the listeners to

42:34.560 --> 42:39.120
like, it's been a change, but like, you know, I, now that we're doing it, I am kind of kicking

42:39.120 --> 42:42.580
myself a little bit going, God, we should have done it like three years sooner.

42:42.580 --> 42:46.040
You know, we could have been more on the cutting edge of it, but it is what it is.

42:46.040 --> 42:51.280
Like, I don't, no regrets, you know, when all is said and done.

42:51.280 --> 42:55.800
The other thing, the other thing I just want to say about video improvements, more, I just,

42:55.800 --> 43:01.760
there's not enough time to produce more B-roll, more things like more user created or out

43:01.760 --> 43:05.820
in the road, out in the field, created segments, admittedly, I've been slacking on that a little

43:05.820 --> 43:06.820
bit.

43:06.820 --> 43:08.580
Like I've been trying to do some break segments, but.

43:08.580 --> 43:15.580
Well maybe if I record a ton of footage this week, I can clip a best of thing together.

43:15.620 --> 43:20.440
I'm still trying to do the laser tag stuff, but it's hard to do laser tag footage because

43:20.440 --> 43:21.820
the footage is okay.

43:21.820 --> 43:27.540
Um, I know now I'm not the talk over it when I'm recording, but their music is so goddamn

43:27.540 --> 43:31.500
loud and it's just like, all audio can be stripped and replaced though.

43:31.500 --> 43:35.900
It's very easy to strip out and you can hear the pew pew and the killing, but I guess I

43:35.900 --> 43:40.180
gotta, I gotta record that and then dub it back in and it should actually just be you

43:40.180 --> 43:44.660
going pew pew, laser beams, pew pew.

43:44.660 --> 43:46.460
All right.

43:46.460 --> 43:51.260
Bobby followed up, uh, SJ100 Matt's question, just wanting to chime in saying, by the way,

43:51.260 --> 43:55.700
we're going to address some of these questions at our Dragon Con panel Saturday at two 30

43:55.700 --> 43:58.700
because it's about taking your audio podcast and moving it to video.

43:58.700 --> 44:03.140
Like we actually have a panel about this thing that we've done here at VOG Network, which

44:03.140 --> 44:04.140
is really cool.

44:04.140 --> 44:08.060
So that's going to be Saturday at two 30 PM and that is going to be live streamed on Twitch

44:08.060 --> 44:09.980
at DC Digital Media.

44:09.980 --> 44:15.360
Step one in your, you're taking your audio podcast into video is put the cat and isolate

44:15.360 --> 44:17.180
the cat in a different part of the house.

44:17.180 --> 44:18.180
Word of God.

44:18.180 --> 44:20.020
That's where he's about to go in a minute.

44:20.020 --> 44:21.020
All right.

44:21.020 --> 44:22.460
Uh, let's go to another tweet here.

44:22.460 --> 44:29.360
Dark Tetsuya with another tweet saying, going back on the president cat thing from last

44:29.360 --> 44:30.900
week for a bit.

44:30.900 --> 44:36.700
Did you know, apparently Jorudan, the company that was making it, got out of the game industry

44:36.700 --> 44:38.200
some time ago.

44:38.200 --> 44:42.200
So we may have to start hashtag save president cat.

44:42.200 --> 44:43.620
What do you guys think?

44:43.620 --> 44:45.800
So Jorudan got out of the game industry.

44:45.800 --> 44:50.400
Well, if the game sold as bad as everybody said it did, I'm surprised they didn't get

44:50.400 --> 44:52.040
out of the game industry a long time ago.

44:52.040 --> 44:55.240
Maybe we can purchase the IP for president cat.

44:55.240 --> 44:56.240
Holy shit.

44:56.240 --> 44:57.240
That's the best idea.

44:57.240 --> 44:59.360
Oh my God.

44:59.360 --> 45:03.300
Now we have something we can spend all this bitty money on, right Bobby?

45:03.300 --> 45:09.380
Can we spend all the subscription money on getting the rights to president cat?

45:09.380 --> 45:10.380
You know what though?

45:10.380 --> 45:12.380
I mean, think about it.

45:12.380 --> 45:20.300
If we did do that and then we get our crack team of, uh, game designers who listen to

45:20.300 --> 45:25.860
us all, what, three of them and no, I would, I would buy the rights to present.

45:25.860 --> 45:32.700
I would buy the rights to president cat and give them, give them to Y Y R as a gift.

45:32.700 --> 45:36.580
I was actually sort of thinking about doing like actual legit marketing on it.

45:36.580 --> 45:38.560
They have produced so many hamster games.

45:38.560 --> 45:39.560
It's ridiculous.

45:39.560 --> 45:40.560
Really?

45:40.560 --> 45:41.560
Yes.

45:41.560 --> 45:42.560
All right.

45:42.560 --> 45:46.180
Anything that's like actually been released in the States or like they all Japanese games?

45:46.180 --> 45:47.540
Well, they did a vert.

45:47.540 --> 45:50.980
They did the SNES version of alien versus predator game boy color.

45:50.980 --> 45:54.020
They had bubble bubble classic and chase HQ, secret police.

45:54.020 --> 45:57.020
So there's some stuff they do that come up as a Yogi bear game.

45:57.020 --> 46:01.440
Oh, and so many hamster club games.

46:01.440 --> 46:09.260
There's like one, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

46:09.260 --> 46:13.760
Also the pets hamsters life too, cause obviously they're really, you know, they're good at

46:13.760 --> 46:15.160
making hamster games.

46:15.160 --> 46:17.100
That's what we've established here.

46:17.100 --> 46:20.620
And to be fair, actually, as much as we're joking about buying the rights to president

46:20.620 --> 46:23.800
cat, I actually don't think the rights were with that gaming company.

46:23.800 --> 46:29.200
I think wasn't the character of Rena, like a comic or something like something that existed

46:29.200 --> 46:30.720
on a TV parody.

46:30.720 --> 46:34.760
Like I feel like that, that, that cat character actually existed somewhere else.

46:34.760 --> 46:37.320
It's a mascot of a blog named Nico punch.

46:37.320 --> 46:38.320
Okay.

46:38.320 --> 46:39.320
So, so I go punch him.

46:39.320 --> 46:40.320
I was kind of right.

46:40.320 --> 46:41.800
I just didn't know it was a blog.

46:41.800 --> 46:42.800
All right.

46:42.800 --> 46:47.500
Well, we just licensed it from the blog then fair enough.

46:47.500 --> 46:48.500
I bet.

46:48.500 --> 46:49.500
I bet.

46:49.500 --> 46:51.300
If we ask that guy from the blog is gone.

46:51.300 --> 46:56.860
So I bet if we asked that guy very nicely from the Oh, Iraq studios that made cat president,

46:56.860 --> 46:59.740
we can maybe buy his rights to cat president.

46:59.740 --> 47:00.740
Probably a lot cheaper.

47:00.740 --> 47:01.740
I don't know.

47:01.740 --> 47:02.740
Yeah.

47:02.740 --> 47:03.740
The Nico punch blog is gone.

47:03.740 --> 47:05.880
Apparently they've disbanded after them.

47:05.880 --> 47:07.380
Maybe the rights are available.

47:07.380 --> 47:08.380
Stay tuned.

47:08.380 --> 47:09.380
Stay tuned.

47:09.380 --> 47:10.380
All right.

47:10.380 --> 47:11.380
One more question.

47:11.380 --> 47:12.380
We'll just make our own president cat.

47:12.380 --> 47:13.380
You know what?

47:13.380 --> 47:14.380
That's right.

47:14.380 --> 47:18.140
I know it's not technically, technically we made president cat.

47:18.140 --> 47:22.040
That game had a Japanese name that meant like boss cat.

47:22.040 --> 47:24.620
We made president cat.

47:24.620 --> 47:30.380
So therefore thusly, and I can just take a picture of Mr. Smoosh with a president cat

47:30.380 --> 47:31.980
hat on like an Abe Lincoln hat.

47:31.980 --> 47:33.700
And that can be president cat.

47:33.700 --> 47:37.300
Yeah, but Midna would be queen cat.

47:37.300 --> 47:41.420
Well, she, uh, uh, Midna can be secretary of milk.

47:41.420 --> 47:43.680
No, she's the queen.

47:43.680 --> 47:46.900
She's not nobody's secretary cause she's a girl cat.

47:46.900 --> 47:50.100
No, I was thinking secretary of state like Hillary Clinton.

47:50.100 --> 47:51.100
Come on.

47:51.100 --> 47:52.100
All right.

47:52.100 --> 47:53.100
All right.

47:53.100 --> 48:01.780
Anyway, going on to our last tweet from, uh, the annual K it's D underscore annual K I

48:01.780 --> 48:08.220
actually know Daniel K or as I call them on this show, the other DK, uh, so DK is a tweeting

48:08.220 --> 48:14.700
us tonight saying, hi, hello, uh, what makes gaming so exciting for y'all?

48:14.700 --> 48:21.020
I think that's a very blunt, direct, good question to remind us why we do this podcast.

48:21.020 --> 48:25.640
What makes gaming exciting because it's been a part of my entire life and it would feel

48:25.640 --> 48:30.980
weird not having it there be like missing the leg.

48:30.980 --> 48:31.980
What do you think?

48:31.980 --> 48:33.780
What makes gaming exciting for you?

48:33.780 --> 48:41.940
Um, whenever I get a really good story, but it also has, um, like things in the world

48:41.940 --> 48:49.140
that make it unique and special, like, you know, for example, having culture or its own

48:49.140 --> 49:00.060
Conlang or, um, when they put thought into the sociology in the game.

49:00.060 --> 49:05.620
So it's, it's the effort into the world when they build a world that excites me, then I

49:05.620 --> 49:08.980
really want to learn everything I can about it.

49:08.980 --> 49:12.660
You know, I could go all the way back with an answer to this, to when I was like first

49:12.660 --> 49:16.660
gaming on the Atari 2,600 and part of what always drew me to video games was the fact

49:16.660 --> 49:19.900
that I was controlling what was on the television.

49:19.900 --> 49:24.100
You know, usually, you know, you would be watching cable, you'd be watching things that

49:24.100 --> 49:27.020
somebody else made and is sending to your TV.

49:27.020 --> 49:30.820
But when I played Atari 2,600 for the first time, it was playing a game like kaboom.

49:30.820 --> 49:34.780
I was in control of those buckets, trying to catch the bombs that were dropping, you

49:34.780 --> 49:40.240
know, and I was the one that would fail or succeed and have that kind of sense of accomplishment.

49:40.240 --> 49:41.740
And so I think it's kind of like both those things.

49:41.740 --> 49:46.800
I think it's like being able, being able to feel like you are part of the art.

49:46.800 --> 49:51.740
You know, if we're to say that video games are art, which I do fully believe they are,

49:51.740 --> 49:55.100
you know, movies are art, paintings are art, books are art.

49:55.100 --> 49:57.940
But how often do you get to be a part of those?

49:57.940 --> 50:03.020
I mean, I know there's always kind of like these kind of interesting genre bending things

50:03.020 --> 50:06.700
like choose your own adventure books, let's say, they let you be a part of it, right?

50:06.700 --> 50:10.140
But for the most part, you don't really get to be in those.

50:10.140 --> 50:14.140
But with a video game and gaming, you get to be a part of that.

50:14.140 --> 50:15.540
You're in control.

50:15.540 --> 50:18.620
You're the one that's going to determine success or failure.

50:18.620 --> 50:24.680
Whether that's a very simple, easy, repetitive type of Atari 2,600 old school game like kaboom

50:24.680 --> 50:29.940
or something like that, or to something new and modern and very story driven like Mass

50:29.940 --> 50:30.940
Effect.

50:30.940 --> 50:34.520
You know, ultimately you're in the control of the choices and you're going to determine

50:34.520 --> 50:36.760
what happens to the galaxy in a game like that.

50:36.760 --> 50:39.780
Or even something very open world like Minecraft.

50:39.780 --> 50:44.580
If you want to build a town full of houses shaped like penises, that is your prerogative.

50:44.580 --> 50:45.580
That's your call.

50:45.580 --> 50:47.100
You could do whatever you want.

50:47.100 --> 50:49.140
And so I think it's kind of like those things.

50:49.140 --> 50:53.140
The fact that you become part of the art, I think is what makes gaming exciting for

50:53.140 --> 50:54.680
me.

50:54.680 --> 50:57.140
We have a bonus question from The Other DK.

50:57.140 --> 50:58.340
All right.

50:58.340 --> 50:59.340
Bonus question.

50:59.340 --> 51:04.980
What out there, in quotey fingers, what out there gaming concept do you think will be

51:04.980 --> 51:07.540
released in the near future?

51:07.540 --> 51:13.180
For example, flying cars or something completely outlandish.

51:13.180 --> 51:17.380
What out there gaming concept do you think will be released in the near future?

51:17.380 --> 51:24.980
Well, where my brain goes right off the bat is like HUDs, user display, right?

51:24.980 --> 51:30.860
Like I think I almost feel like GPS and like navigation on something like Google Maps or

51:30.860 --> 51:37.020
Apple Maps or something like GPS navigation in some ways I feel like is inspired by like

51:37.580 --> 51:41.820
those genre of open world games where like the arrow points to your next destination.

51:41.820 --> 51:44.500
Like I kind of feel like GPS is kind of that.

51:44.500 --> 51:47.540
So my answer kind of takes that a step further.

51:47.540 --> 51:52.460
And some of those other things that we do in video games with like, you know, and already

51:52.460 --> 51:56.720
like, you know, if you drive a very modern car like a Tesla or something like I feel

51:56.720 --> 52:02.180
like a lot of the way those navigate is like things that you've seen in gaming in a way.

52:02.180 --> 52:07.980
Yeah, it's like you were saying, like AR stuff basically is kind of what we'll see

52:07.980 --> 52:12.500
all sorts of weird implementations of that because they've already tried to do like some

52:12.500 --> 52:17.460
sort of AR like like first person shooter games where they have like, you know, this

52:17.460 --> 52:22.860
weird ass laser gun, like almost like laser tag, but with like your phone strapped to

52:22.860 --> 52:25.860
it, which that's probably pretty lame.

52:25.860 --> 52:31.580
But like I can imagine later on, like actually getting a good AR system where it just works

52:31.580 --> 52:34.700
seamlessly wherever you go, then that could be pretty cool.

52:34.700 --> 52:37.540
I think you're right on the money with like AR.

52:37.540 --> 52:41.460
Like right now we think of AR like being used in things like Pokemon Go.

52:41.460 --> 52:42.980
You know, it's very basic.

52:42.980 --> 52:44.180
It is very basic.

52:44.180 --> 52:49.300
But I could see that AR like imagine this now maybe AR in the future.

52:49.300 --> 52:54.260
Like let's say you're having trouble building IKEA furniture like AR could like look at

52:54.260 --> 52:57.780
what you've built and show you the next piece and where it goes.

52:57.780 --> 52:58.780
It just says no.

52:58.780 --> 52:59.780
Yes.

52:59.780 --> 53:00.780
No.

53:00.980 --> 53:01.980
This is all wrong.

53:01.980 --> 53:02.980
All of this is wrong.

53:02.980 --> 53:05.260
That little cartoon character with the X.

53:05.260 --> 53:06.260
But you know what I mean?

53:06.260 --> 53:07.340
Like like that type of.

53:07.340 --> 53:09.340
And I think we've we've seen that already.

53:09.340 --> 53:14.340
Like some very rudimentary versions of that would like placing pretend furniture in a

53:14.340 --> 53:18.260
home to pretend what your house might look like if you lived in it.

53:18.260 --> 53:19.260
And that type of thing.

53:19.260 --> 53:21.700
So I think I think some of those AR gaming concepts, especially when it comes to your

53:21.700 --> 53:24.260
mobile phone and through your phone, I think you're right on the money.

53:24.260 --> 53:28.900
I think I think that is like a very valid, like realistic answer to this question.

53:28.900 --> 53:32.500
That's the type of stuff we're seeing in gaming now that I bet will show up more and more

53:32.500 --> 53:37.780
in the real world that AR and being able to, you know, pretend that things are there and

53:37.780 --> 53:41.260
help walk you through those types of things I think is going to continue to grow and be

53:41.260 --> 53:42.260
huge.

53:42.260 --> 53:44.260
Jamie, I don't want to leave you out of an answer, though.

53:44.260 --> 53:48.900
What what kind of like out there concept from gaming do you think will be a technology we

53:48.900 --> 53:51.460
all use in our daily lives?

53:51.460 --> 53:56.460
I'm thinking I mean, this might sound stupid, but we've been talking about like the whole

53:56.460 --> 53:57.460
holodeck thing.

53:58.020 --> 54:04.500
And, you know, they already have those holographic keyboards.

54:04.500 --> 54:10.060
Could you imagine like having sort of like a holo pad or something that would bring up

54:10.060 --> 54:17.020
things like interactive displays and you're kind of like almost like having your Wii U

54:17.020 --> 54:18.340
screen in hand?

54:18.340 --> 54:19.340
Yeah.

54:19.340 --> 54:25.900
But instead you have like a holographic HUD or a maybe something that uses AR on your

54:25.900 --> 54:26.900
phone?

54:27.340 --> 54:30.340
Or haptics.

54:30.340 --> 54:32.020
No, I know.

54:32.020 --> 54:36.060
I know we always joke that like with each generation of gaming, we're getting one step

54:36.060 --> 54:37.420
closer to the holodeck.

54:37.420 --> 54:38.420
But it's true.

54:38.420 --> 54:39.420
Right.

54:39.420 --> 54:44.100
And especially now that things like VR and AR are becoming more and more like, you know,

54:44.100 --> 54:48.420
sure, you still have to put on this giant headset to really, truly experience, you know,

54:48.420 --> 54:49.420
VR.

54:49.420 --> 54:51.300
Like, I remember like we were like, think about that, like in the 90s.

54:51.300 --> 54:54.660
And it's like, oh, that's kind of cool and everything, but like, it'll never happen.

54:54.660 --> 54:57.420
You know, and now it's just like kind of, well, and then that technology is going to

54:57.420 --> 55:03.260
get more and more light, like, you know, VHS tapes were bulky and now everything is like

55:03.260 --> 55:04.260
digital.

55:04.260 --> 55:07.580
And so, you know, it's, there's going to come a time when that technology is not so bulky

55:07.580 --> 55:12.460
and things like, I know we, Google Glass did not do so well.

55:12.460 --> 55:16.420
Everybody always joked about glass holes and things like that, but I think there is going

55:16.420 --> 55:20.860
to come a time when like you're wearing glasses and the glasses already have it.

55:20.860 --> 55:26.180
There's North, which is a new, there's like $600 glasses.

55:26.180 --> 55:28.600
They were actually selling them last weekend at Intel.

55:28.600 --> 55:31.540
They have their pop up shop, but they have like two in the United, one in the United

55:31.540 --> 55:33.460
States and one in Canada.

55:33.460 --> 55:35.220
But like they're $600 glasses.

55:35.220 --> 55:39.340
All they do is like, they show like notifications on your glasses, but it's, it's like projected

55:39.340 --> 55:45.060
on there and you can see like everything and I wanted it.

55:45.060 --> 55:49.620
It's complete garbage, like for $600, like I don't need to be spending it, but it's neat

55:49.620 --> 55:50.620
and I want it.

55:50.620 --> 55:51.620
So, yeah.

55:51.620 --> 55:56.560
And you know, what's funny is that our pal Bobby Black Wolf is doing that panel.

55:56.560 --> 55:58.900
So Bobby got on three tracks this year.

55:58.900 --> 55:59.900
We were all excited.

55:59.900 --> 56:02.620
Last year we were on two tracks, digital media and video games.

56:02.620 --> 56:04.060
Dude, Bobby got on the third.

56:04.060 --> 56:08.820
He's on the Star Trek track this year because they actually do a panel every year.

56:08.820 --> 56:10.380
That's like update.

56:10.380 --> 56:12.860
How much closer is the holodeck to being a reality?

56:12.860 --> 56:13.860
Oh yes.

56:13.860 --> 56:18.340
Cause you know, he does a lot with VR, not just as a, as a hobbyist.

56:18.380 --> 56:23.180
So, uh, he's on that panel this year and I'm actually, I'm excited to check it out personally

56:23.180 --> 56:27.500
and uh, it's a bummer you don't go to Dragon Con dark soccer cause I bet you'd get a kick

56:27.500 --> 56:28.500
out of that panel too.

56:28.500 --> 56:31.460
Want to pay for my ticket?

56:31.460 --> 56:34.140
Well, I'm, I'm, I'm not that rich sadly.

56:34.140 --> 56:37.100
I didn't win a million dollars playing survivor unfortunately.

56:37.100 --> 56:40.460
Um, I got a blanket so I don't have a lot of money to share.

56:40.460 --> 56:41.860
All right.

56:41.860 --> 56:42.860
Anyway.

56:42.860 --> 56:43.860
All right.

56:43.860 --> 56:45.760
Well that, those were some great questions.

56:45.760 --> 56:46.760
Thank you guys so much.

56:46.760 --> 56:51.680
I, I feel like we might have to incorporate Twitter questions more often into the show.

56:51.680 --> 56:53.880
Um, just because we get good stuff on there.

56:53.880 --> 56:58.080
So no, we haven't played any games recently on the show.

56:58.080 --> 57:02.520
I know we haven't cause um, I think ever since we switched to video, we kind of left those

57:02.520 --> 57:03.520
by the wayside.

57:03.520 --> 57:08.640
But um, I think there was talk about using Twitch extensions to bring some of that functionality

57:08.640 --> 57:09.640
back.

57:09.640 --> 57:13.560
I don't want to say too much cause I don't know what, I don't remember what Bobby told

57:13.560 --> 57:14.560
me.

57:14.560 --> 57:16.360
He can't, he can't do, but they are things we're thinking about.

57:16.360 --> 57:17.920
But yeah, we haven't done any of the games in a while.

57:17.920 --> 57:19.600
We need to bring some of the game shows back.

57:19.600 --> 57:22.400
So anyway, um, great questions.

57:22.400 --> 57:23.400
Yay.

57:23.400 --> 57:25.000
Uh, let's take a trip down memory lane.

57:25.000 --> 57:29.680
Uh, every week dark Sakura jumps into the gaming vault and finds the game that she thinks,

57:29.680 --> 57:35.160
Hey, you guys should put, put your Google glass down and uh, check out this.

57:35.160 --> 57:41.080
You have to, you have to boot this and Ms. Doss, you're going to type C colon backslash.

57:41.080 --> 57:42.960
Then you're going to type CDs space.

57:42.960 --> 57:43.960
All right.

57:43.960 --> 57:44.960
Dark soccer.

57:44.960 --> 57:47.360
That's actually being very literal cause I know what she picked for tonight.

57:47.360 --> 57:50.080
So that is the type of way you would have to boot this game, right?

57:50.080 --> 57:51.080
Dark soccer.

57:51.080 --> 57:53.340
What did you pick tonight for the classic game of the week?

57:53.340 --> 58:00.680
I picked jazz Jack rabbit developed and published by Epic mega games.

58:00.680 --> 58:11.880
It came out in 1994 it came out for PCs operating Doss later on there were Mac and windows versions.

58:11.880 --> 58:25.440
So this would be like windows 3.1 or one one if you were a networker or windows 95

58:25.440 --> 58:30.200
if you were to afford the newest operating system at the time, but yeah, at any, at any

58:30.200 --> 58:36.000
rate the game is set in the world based on the tortoise and the hare.

58:36.000 --> 58:42.520
So, but it has the, the hatred between the tortoises and the hares have still gone on

58:42.520 --> 58:45.040
for 3000 years.

58:45.040 --> 58:49.480
There's an evil tortoise named Devin shell who started conquering planets and doing just

58:49.480 --> 58:51.540
general evil things.

58:51.540 --> 59:00.840
And one of the planets named Cara Tuss, uh, had a peaceful hair kingdom and then was,

59:00.840 --> 59:08.240
you know, eventually, um, you know, was able to starve off the, uh, the tortoises attacking

59:08.240 --> 59:10.680
and then they kidnapped their princess.

59:10.680 --> 59:18.920
So of course, because we have the female character only exists to serve as a tag.

59:18.920 --> 59:23.800
So anyway, we have just Jack rabbit who has to go rescue the princess and he has a light,

59:23.800 --> 59:30.000
uh, sorry, a blue gun that he goes around shooting things.

59:30.000 --> 59:34.080
He wears a red bandana cause it was the nineties and that's edgy.

59:34.080 --> 59:35.760
He's also bright green.

59:35.760 --> 59:44.340
And so, um, basically it is, uh, some, uh, platforming, um, you basically go around jumping

59:44.340 --> 59:45.380
on shit.

59:45.380 --> 59:46.680
You can shoot shit.

59:46.680 --> 59:53.600
You can run fast, jump higher the longer that you run kind of Sonic-y, um, but in no way

59:53.600 --> 59:56.960
there's inspiration from Sonic in this.

59:56.960 --> 01:00:06.440
Funny you mentioned that it was actually inspired by Zool for the Amiga, but you know, no one

01:00:06.440 --> 01:00:09.840
has original ideas since, you know, 1982 anyway.

01:00:09.840 --> 01:00:17.000
So at any rate, um, you've got like, you can get a hoverboard and you can get like, uh,

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:23.440
force fields and a sidekick bird and different speeds up and invincibilities, extra lives,

01:00:23.440 --> 01:00:24.440
all kinds of stuff like that.

01:00:24.440 --> 01:00:32.440
You can get TNT, get big containers of ammo, but it has like no abysses, like no holes.

01:00:32.440 --> 01:00:35.440
So you just keep going, you can't die by falling.

01:00:35.440 --> 01:00:41.440
Um, so as it goes, so the game's divided into six episodes and each episode has three planets

01:00:41.440 --> 01:00:44.880
and worlds and every planet has two levels.

01:00:44.880 --> 01:00:49.920
Um, sometimes they have an additional secret level and then, uh, the final level of every

01:00:49.920 --> 01:00:52.200
episode has a boss fight.

01:00:52.200 --> 01:01:00.800
Um, and I think it's like, uh, unlimited continues, I think it's been an agent, I've played it,

01:01:00.800 --> 01:01:10.040
but at any rate, um, it was, uh, you know, inspired by the game Zool for the Amiga and,

01:01:10.040 --> 01:01:15.720
um, and it was driven by the success of other classics like Sonic the Hedgehog and the Mega

01:01:15.720 --> 01:01:18.440
Man series that kept it going on.

01:01:18.440 --> 01:01:26.720
And it was though considered to be, they thought that it was a, uh, a pastiche, which is a

01:01:26.720 --> 01:01:30.720
type of visual reference.

01:01:30.720 --> 01:01:38.600
One that celebrates, um, Sonic the Hedgehog, but it wasn't quite, you know, that really

01:01:38.600 --> 01:01:39.600
wasn't what it was.

01:01:39.600 --> 01:01:41.440
It was more like it was derived from Zool.

01:01:41.440 --> 01:01:46.560
Um, it also had interactive music called Cyber Sound Music System.

01:01:47.040 --> 01:01:51.960
Um, it did get a CD version that had the original six episodes and three additional ones called

01:01:51.960 --> 01:01:53.920
the Lost Episodes.

01:01:53.920 --> 01:01:58.800
Um, and then it had an episode with Jazz as a lizard.

01:01:58.800 --> 01:02:05.080
And then there was a shareware edition that had just a special three level themed episode

01:02:05.080 --> 01:02:07.120
called Holiday Hair.

01:02:07.120 --> 01:02:11.680
Um, this was, uh, from Jack Jazz Rabbit, uh, Jazz Jack Rabbit CD.

01:02:11.680 --> 01:02:17.040
Um, and then there were other like shareware holiday versions.

01:02:17.040 --> 01:02:22.360
And of course then in 1988, there was a sequel and a reboot on Game Boy Advance and then

01:02:22.360 --> 01:02:33.520
a Kickstarter, um, done by one of the co-creators, Cliff Bleszinski, who, uh, actually was later

01:02:33.520 --> 01:02:38.020
on one of the forces in Epic Games' Unreal in Gears of War.

01:02:38.020 --> 01:02:41.080
So we have some tie-ins to current things.

01:02:41.080 --> 01:02:49.240
And of course you can get this on, you know, on other, like, I think it's on GOG and other

01:02:49.240 --> 01:02:54.480
stuff so you can still get the game today.

01:02:54.480 --> 01:02:56.600
So go play it is what you're saying.

01:02:56.600 --> 01:02:57.600
Eh.

01:02:57.600 --> 01:02:58.600
Or not.

01:02:58.600 --> 01:03:05.280
I'll be honest, I was into it for a hot minute when it was like new, but at the time I wasn't

01:03:05.280 --> 01:03:08.920
really so much a fan of playing games on the PC, you know?

01:03:08.920 --> 01:03:13.120
Like my MMO was Gemstone.

01:03:13.120 --> 01:03:18.880
You know, I would play like the point and clicks, but an action game like that, it wasn't

01:03:18.880 --> 01:03:23.280
really my, my, my, uh, uh, you know, bottle of vodka.

01:03:23.280 --> 01:03:24.280
All right.

01:03:24.280 --> 01:03:26.280
Well, there it is anyway, your classic game of the week.

01:03:26.280 --> 01:03:27.680
And it's one I play.

01:03:27.680 --> 01:03:31.760
I probably played Jill of the Jungle more, but I still enjoyed some Jazz Jack Rabbit.

01:03:31.760 --> 01:03:32.760
That's for sure.

01:03:32.760 --> 01:03:37.240
So, I mean, go play it, you know, learn some of the roots of your games.

01:03:37.240 --> 01:03:44.040
You know, it's one of those niche appreciation type games that had big appreciation in its

01:03:44.040 --> 01:03:45.040
niche.

01:03:45.040 --> 01:03:46.040
Yeah.

01:03:46.040 --> 01:03:47.040
And you know, yeah.

01:03:47.040 --> 01:03:49.040
And you know, again, cause I don't want to make it sound like we're, we're negative on

01:03:49.040 --> 01:03:50.040
this game.

01:03:50.040 --> 01:03:53.520
We're not, not whatsoever because like this game, I think you didn't really have a lot

01:03:53.520 --> 01:03:55.480
of like platformers on the PC.

01:03:55.480 --> 01:03:58.860
You didn't think of like platforming games, like this was the type of game you would expect

01:03:58.860 --> 01:04:02.760
to see on a Super Nintendo, but instead you got to play it on your PC and that wasn't

01:04:02.760 --> 01:04:03.760
very common.

01:04:03.760 --> 01:04:06.520
And I think that's something very important to realize about, you know, the nineties when

01:04:06.520 --> 01:04:10.760
this was out is that seeing these types of platforming games on the PC, especially as

01:04:10.760 --> 01:04:14.000
well-rounded as this, not super common.

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:19.480
So it really felt like, yeah, you were playing something like a Super Nintendo game, but

01:04:19.480 --> 01:04:22.120
on your PC and that was pretty rad.

01:04:22.120 --> 01:04:26.900
And also, you know, there's many people now that think Epic is just the Fortnite company,

01:04:26.900 --> 01:04:32.200
but in reality they've had a huge history in gaming and shareware.

01:04:32.200 --> 01:04:33.200
That's right.

01:04:33.200 --> 01:04:34.200
And shareware.

01:04:34.200 --> 01:04:35.200
That's also very important.

01:04:35.200 --> 01:04:36.200
So there it is.

01:04:36.200 --> 01:04:38.720
Your classic game of the week, Jazz Jackrabbits.

01:04:38.720 --> 01:04:43.120
I'm surprised they have a remaster, didn't they do like an HD remaster of it or something?

01:04:43.120 --> 01:04:46.040
But I'm surprised they haven't like done a sequel or anything.

01:04:46.040 --> 01:04:47.040
Yeah.

01:04:47.040 --> 01:04:48.040
I'm kind of surprised.

01:04:48.040 --> 01:04:49.040
It was like a thing from the Kickstarter.

01:04:49.040 --> 01:04:50.040
Yeah.

01:04:50.040 --> 01:04:51.640
I feel like there was like a mobile thing or whatever.

01:04:51.640 --> 01:04:52.640
Oh yeah.

01:04:52.640 --> 01:04:53.640
Not the same.

01:04:53.640 --> 01:04:54.640
Not the same.

01:04:54.640 --> 01:04:55.640
All right.

01:04:55.640 --> 01:04:56.880
Um, we need to catch up on some news.

01:04:56.880 --> 01:04:59.440
So we're only, you know, we're taping this really partway through the week.

01:04:59.440 --> 01:05:00.880
So we may not get everything.

01:05:00.880 --> 01:05:05.040
There may still be some big news that comes up that we don't get to on Sunday, but there

01:05:05.040 --> 01:05:07.920
have been quite a few headlines to cover nonetheless.

01:05:07.920 --> 01:05:10.160
So let's start talking about some headlines.

01:05:10.160 --> 01:05:14.320
So of course this week we had Gamescom and so there's been lots of announcements for

01:05:14.320 --> 01:05:15.320
that.

01:05:15.320 --> 01:05:20.000
They had this big open night live ceremony thing hosted by Jeff Keighley.

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:23.400
And with that, they showed off a bunch of different trailers for stuff.

01:05:23.400 --> 01:05:26.560
So some of the things covered there, of course, they talked a little bit about Call of Duty

01:05:26.560 --> 01:05:32.320
Modern Warfare, which is having an open alpha that starts on, well would have started on

01:05:32.320 --> 01:05:34.780
Friday, August 23rd.

01:05:34.780 --> 01:05:39.460
And then they announced a sequel to Kerbal Space Program.

01:05:39.460 --> 01:05:43.820
So that's coming in 2020, the consoles and PC.

01:05:43.820 --> 01:05:47.740
There's a game Humankind by Sega.

01:05:47.740 --> 01:05:52.740
That's that was that big AAA game or whatever that they were teasing last week, right?

01:05:52.740 --> 01:05:53.740
Yeah.

01:05:53.740 --> 01:05:56.340
Some simulation game of human history.

01:05:56.340 --> 01:05:57.340
That's coming in 2020.

01:05:57.340 --> 01:06:02.020
I guess that's what makes it AAA because it's all of history in one game.

01:06:02.020 --> 01:06:05.660
Total Nightmares 2 is something that they announced in 2020 as well.

01:06:05.660 --> 01:06:08.700
THQ Nordic is rebooting Comanche.

01:06:08.700 --> 01:06:15.220
So they're doing it's a helicopter action game and that's going to be coming out.

01:06:15.220 --> 01:06:17.380
Need for Speed Heat.

01:06:17.380 --> 01:06:19.260
They've got the Heat Studio that you can download.

01:06:19.260 --> 01:06:22.820
It's a mobile app that you can customize cars because they want you to really buy those

01:06:22.820 --> 01:06:24.460
skins when it comes out.

01:06:24.460 --> 01:06:28.520
A match at the Gathering Arena should be coming.

01:06:28.520 --> 01:06:32.240
It's a semi exclusive to the Epic Games Store.

01:06:32.240 --> 01:06:36.440
Iron Harvest is releasing on September 1st, 2020.

01:06:36.440 --> 01:06:40.120
This game called Disintegration looks pretty awesome.

01:06:40.120 --> 01:06:41.440
They showed that off.

01:06:41.440 --> 01:06:43.760
Not to be confused with a great Cure album.

01:06:43.760 --> 01:06:44.760
No.

01:06:44.760 --> 01:06:47.800
And then, of course, let's see what else.

01:06:47.800 --> 01:06:50.560
And then there was this game called Erika, an interactive thriller.

01:06:50.560 --> 01:06:54.680
Oh, yeah, because I think Erika they announced some time ago and then it was like that was

01:06:54.680 --> 01:06:55.800
like their whole like it's out now.

01:06:55.800 --> 01:06:56.800
It's a PlayLink game.

01:06:56.800 --> 01:06:57.800
Yeah.

01:06:58.080 --> 01:07:00.080
You can use your phones with that.

01:07:00.080 --> 01:07:03.840
And that's available now for 10 bucks on PlayStation 4.

01:07:03.840 --> 01:07:07.640
And then, of course, last but not least, of course, because Jeff Keighley is involved,

01:07:07.640 --> 01:07:12.520
you knew there was another Death Stranding trailer coming and they had a brand new trailer

01:07:12.520 --> 01:07:17.440
showing off some new characters, including Jeff Keighley is actually in the game, not

01:07:17.440 --> 01:07:20.500
voiced by him, which is awfully weird, though.

01:07:20.500 --> 01:07:23.240
And then instead they got Gilbert Gottfried.

01:07:23.240 --> 01:07:24.440
No.

01:07:24.440 --> 01:07:29.160
And then they have was it the one character, Mama, that they showed off that all sorts

01:07:29.160 --> 01:07:30.160
of strange.

01:07:30.160 --> 01:07:31.160
OK.

01:07:31.160 --> 01:07:34.360
You know, she's breastfeeding a ghost baby.

01:07:34.360 --> 01:07:36.440
I didn't see the new trailer.

01:07:36.440 --> 01:07:42.760
I'm I'm kind of all like all my change for Death Stranding hype has been spent.

01:07:42.760 --> 01:07:45.320
That doesn't mean I don't like want to check out the game or anything.

01:07:45.320 --> 01:07:49.080
I'm actually doing the game a favor by holding off on the hype.

01:07:49.080 --> 01:07:50.080
Yes.

01:07:50.080 --> 01:07:52.080
So that when it comes out, I can just play the fucking game.

01:07:52.080 --> 01:07:53.080
Exactly.

01:07:53.080 --> 01:07:54.080
It looks interesting.

01:07:54.720 --> 01:07:55.720
To be to be clear, I'm not being a hater.

01:07:55.720 --> 01:07:57.400
I'm actually doing the game a favor.

01:07:57.400 --> 01:08:00.880
Like I'm worried the more and more we hype this shit up, the more and more we're setting

01:08:00.880 --> 01:08:03.240
ourselves up for a no man's sky type of situation.

01:08:03.240 --> 01:08:05.560
So I'm just going to take the game for what it is when it comes out.

01:08:05.560 --> 01:08:09.720
And then, of course, Microsoft had their own inside Xbox around the same time.

01:08:09.720 --> 01:08:15.600
So they talked a lot of stuff, including definitely cry fives coming to Xbox Game Pass.

01:08:15.600 --> 01:08:16.600
Cool.

01:08:16.600 --> 01:08:22.000
Stellaris console edition, Age of Empires Definitive Edition will be available on the

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:30.320
PC games pass eight out in Kingdom Come Deliverance will be coming August 22nd, which is today.

01:08:30.320 --> 01:08:34.560
And Bard's Tale for director's cut will be coming on the 27th Blair, which is getting

01:08:34.560 --> 01:08:38.120
added to games pass on console and PC.

01:08:38.120 --> 01:08:39.120
I have game pass.

01:08:39.120 --> 01:08:40.120
I have to check that out.

01:08:40.120 --> 01:08:41.520
And that's on August 30th.

01:08:41.520 --> 01:08:47.440
Humans Fall Flat will be going to scary a free level on PC and Xbox one.

01:08:47.440 --> 01:08:53.720
The announced Age of Empires to definitive edition will be coming November 14th and adds

01:08:53.720 --> 01:08:57.400
better AI, 4K graphics and more improvements.

01:08:57.400 --> 01:09:04.180
Gears pop actually came out today on iOS, Android and Windows 10.

01:09:04.180 --> 01:09:11.480
And Gears, let's see, they said that keyboard noises, Jamie, just, you know, they showed

01:09:11.480 --> 01:09:19.960
off something for NBA 2K 20s career mode, which it has, I guess, Idris Elba and Rosario

01:09:19.960 --> 01:09:20.960
Dawson.

01:09:20.960 --> 01:09:21.960
That's pretty cool.

01:09:21.960 --> 01:09:23.960
Like some big name talent for a sports game.

01:09:23.960 --> 01:09:24.960
That's pretty rad.

01:09:24.960 --> 01:09:26.960
Yeah.

01:09:26.960 --> 01:09:33.160
Ghost War, which is a new multiplayer mode for Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Breakpoint is

01:09:33.160 --> 01:09:34.520
something else they showed off.

01:09:34.520 --> 01:09:38.720
And PUBG is getting cross platform play with PlayStation four in an update in October.

01:09:38.720 --> 01:09:39.760
Oh, wow.

01:09:39.760 --> 01:09:44.320
New Xbox one controller designs, including one that looks like camouflage and one they

01:09:44.320 --> 01:09:47.320
call sports blue.

01:09:47.320 --> 01:09:48.400
It's a pretty blue though.

01:09:48.400 --> 01:09:49.400
It is.

01:09:49.400 --> 01:09:52.000
I don't know why it's sports, but it's a pretty color.

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:56.520
They announced that they're going to be holding a fan event called XO 19, um, the weekend

01:09:56.520 --> 01:09:59.360
of November 14th in London.

01:09:59.360 --> 01:10:04.440
And they're going to have some more announcements around then maybe Xbox, whatever the next

01:10:04.440 --> 01:10:07.120
X boxes seems a little soon for that.

01:10:07.120 --> 01:10:09.640
I don't know why you'd announce that just before the shopping season.

01:10:09.640 --> 01:10:13.720
Like I feel like that's true to recap everything that's going to be available for the holiday.

01:10:13.720 --> 01:10:20.480
And the next year we talk about Scarlet, uh, Metro Exodus is getting two kernels DLC coming

01:10:20.480 --> 01:10:21.480
out.

01:10:21.480 --> 01:10:27.600
Uh, well they already came out by now, August 20th and they showed off a gears war five

01:10:27.600 --> 01:10:29.040
hoard mode.

01:10:29.040 --> 01:10:30.040
Of course.

01:10:30.040 --> 01:10:31.040
Yeah.

01:10:31.040 --> 01:10:32.440
So that was pretty cool.

01:10:32.440 --> 01:10:34.080
And here's something quite ironic.

01:10:34.080 --> 01:10:40.260
So last week we talked about how Minecraft is not getting the ultra awesome, um, super

01:10:40.260 --> 01:10:42.240
graphics pack on consoles.

01:10:42.240 --> 01:10:43.240
Right.

01:10:43.240 --> 01:10:49.160
And then right the very next day, Nvidia's like, Oh, but wait, it's coming to PC because

01:10:49.160 --> 01:10:52.980
they have a ray tracing support now announced.

01:10:52.980 --> 01:10:58.160
If you have an RTX, um, a GTX, a G force RTX card, those are pretty high end video cards

01:10:58.160 --> 01:10:59.160
though.

01:10:59.160 --> 01:11:00.160
Aren't they?

01:11:00.160 --> 01:11:01.160
Yeah.

01:11:01.160 --> 01:11:06.440
So I think 20, I don't know if the 20, 60 supports it, but the 20, 70, 20, 80, um, is

01:11:06.440 --> 01:11:10.400
that like a mod or is that like an official, officially supported, it's an officially supported

01:11:10.400 --> 01:11:11.400
thing.

01:11:11.400 --> 01:11:12.400
Huh?

01:11:12.400 --> 01:11:13.400
Interesting.

01:11:13.400 --> 01:11:15.600
So it's gonna, I don't know if this is the windows 10 version of this, but it is showing

01:11:15.600 --> 01:11:19.240
off like some of the, yeah, it looks like the water effects are pretty crazy.

01:11:19.240 --> 01:11:20.240
Yeah.

01:11:20.240 --> 01:11:21.240
So it looks cool.

01:11:21.240 --> 01:11:27.080
Um, and it is something that's kind of, you know, uh, officially out there.

01:11:27.080 --> 01:11:32.440
So I mean, I, I, I don't have a card to take advantage of that cause I have a laptop, but

01:11:32.440 --> 01:11:34.720
it's someday it's about time for me to upgrade.

01:11:34.720 --> 01:11:35.880
So I'm thinking about it.

01:11:35.880 --> 01:11:36.880
It is pretty, yeah.

01:11:36.880 --> 01:11:41.920
I think it might be an holiday gift to myself as to get myself one of those fancy cards.

01:11:41.920 --> 01:11:44.920
And then a GameStop has laid off over a hundred people.

01:11:44.920 --> 01:11:50.760
Um, so apparently they also laid off half the staff for a game informer, which I gotta

01:11:50.760 --> 01:11:54.200
be honest, I get game of former every month and I like thumb through it really quick and

01:11:54.200 --> 01:11:55.200
it goes in the trash.

01:11:55.200 --> 01:11:57.360
So, I mean, that sucks.

01:11:57.360 --> 01:12:01.480
It sucks that they know people's jobs are being gone, but I kind of understand at least

01:12:01.480 --> 01:12:03.440
the press mega, the, the print magazine.

01:12:03.440 --> 01:12:07.920
I understand that it's kind of print magazines, a harder and harder thing to push these days.

01:12:07.920 --> 01:12:08.920
It's sad.

01:12:08.920 --> 01:12:09.920
Yeah.

01:12:09.920 --> 01:12:12.360
Um, because it's just a lot of the news that we get out of there.

01:12:12.360 --> 01:12:16.160
It's just like, it's old by the time you get it, um, getting harder and harder for them

01:12:16.160 --> 01:12:20.500
to get exclusive news, which was kind of one thing that was keeping them going because

01:12:20.500 --> 01:12:25.180
GameStop is starting to lose more and more of a foothold on the game sales market as

01:12:25.180 --> 01:12:26.780
more goes digital.

01:12:26.780 --> 01:12:30.480
You know, the, the Walmarts and targets of the world keep selling games and you know,

01:12:30.480 --> 01:12:35.960
so it's GameStop is a company we've been saying this for years, it's kind of been in trouble.

01:12:35.960 --> 01:12:41.160
You know, obviously I think they're going to pivot a little bit from just selling video

01:12:41.160 --> 01:12:44.500
games and that you're already seeing that, that they sell more like gaming memorabilia

01:12:44.500 --> 01:12:47.060
and stuff, shirts, things like that.

01:12:47.060 --> 01:12:50.420
But I either they're going to continue to pivot that way or they're going to,

01:12:50.420 --> 01:12:54.580
and you know what, the thing that sucks the most about like that idea, like, and I've

01:12:54.580 --> 01:12:58.900
said it so many times when I go in there, like I like the fact that they have the merchandise

01:12:58.900 --> 01:13:02.340
and stuff and then they have merchandise for like kids and everything like that.

01:13:02.340 --> 01:13:03.340
But guess what?

01:13:03.340 --> 01:13:05.740
They don't have, they don't have shirts for kids.

01:13:05.740 --> 01:13:07.340
They don't have kid sizes for shirts.

01:13:07.340 --> 01:13:08.340
They're all adult sizes.

01:13:08.340 --> 01:13:13.180
I'm like, so many times I would go and buy, I would totally buy a shirt for my son, but

01:13:13.180 --> 01:13:15.740
they don't have sizes for him.

01:13:15.740 --> 01:13:17.660
And it's just, it's kind of frustrating.

01:13:18.100 --> 01:13:21.500
Not even like just, they have such a huge selection of shirts.

01:13:21.500 --> 01:13:26.380
Just make a small section of that or small percentage of it, kid sizes.

01:13:26.380 --> 01:13:29.380
And then I might be, because obviously kids are coming in because you're selling like

01:13:29.380 --> 01:13:34.020
Ryan's World toys and like the random loot box crap that they have or the surprise eggs

01:13:34.020 --> 01:13:35.400
and that kind of thing.

01:13:35.400 --> 01:13:40.540
So obviously you are gearing towards that crowd, but like bring some of that stuff in

01:13:40.540 --> 01:13:43.900
so that we can buy some of that, you know, because you would think a lot of parents be

01:13:43.900 --> 01:13:48.540
like, oh yeah, hey, I want to buy your shirt and get them interested in stuff, but they

01:13:48.540 --> 01:13:52.300
don't have that available, which is such like a loss of potential, I think.

01:13:52.300 --> 01:13:53.300
Yeah, I hear you.

01:13:53.300 --> 01:13:54.300
I agree.

01:13:54.300 --> 01:13:59.500
So anyways, this was apparently part of their previously announced GameStop reboot initiative

01:13:59.500 --> 01:14:05.220
to transform their business for future and improve their financial performance.

01:14:05.220 --> 01:14:11.140
They said we can confirm the workforce reduction was implemented impacting more than 120 corporate

01:14:11.140 --> 01:14:15.940
staff positions representing an approximate 14 percent of our total associate base at

01:14:15.940 --> 01:14:19.980
our company headquarters, as well as some of the other offices.

01:14:19.980 --> 01:14:23.940
While these changes are difficult, they were necessary to reduce costs and better align

01:14:23.940 --> 01:14:29.140
the organization with our efforts to optimize the business to meet our future objectives

01:14:29.140 --> 01:14:30.140
and success.

01:14:30.140 --> 01:14:31.140
Blah, blah, blah, blah.

01:14:31.140 --> 01:14:37.780
Basically, you know, they're trying to reduce costs and realign what their focus as a company

01:14:37.780 --> 01:14:38.780
is.

01:14:39.420 --> 01:14:42.660
In other words, this is the last ditch ever to save us from total bankruptcy.

01:14:42.660 --> 01:14:47.660
I don't know if it's last ditch, but it's kind of like it's we're getting we're they're

01:14:47.660 --> 01:14:48.660
pivoting.

01:14:48.660 --> 01:14:49.660
Yeah, pivoting.

01:14:49.660 --> 01:14:50.660
Yes.

01:14:50.660 --> 01:14:55.140
We'll we'll stick with that as we knew that this announcement was coming, that we finally

01:14:55.140 --> 01:15:00.660
got our announcement trailer for the television Amico and they showed off.

01:15:00.660 --> 01:15:05.860
There was a few I don't know if it was 17 games, but there's 17 games that will be launching.

01:15:05.940 --> 01:15:10.500
OK, hold up, though, because the trailer wasn't like I was thinking it was going to be like

01:15:10.500 --> 01:15:11.500
a trip.

01:15:11.500 --> 01:15:16.540
OK, so that trailer was like a whole bunch of like shots of the Amico, which, you know,

01:15:16.540 --> 01:15:17.540
it does.

01:15:17.540 --> 01:15:18.540
It looks nice.

01:15:18.540 --> 01:15:22.940
Seeing those little controller screens in action was pretty mixed in with Tommy being

01:15:22.940 --> 01:15:28.100
Tommy and talking a lot for like a good three and a half minutes of that trailer.

01:15:28.100 --> 01:15:32.300
And then like the last maybe forty five seconds was bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam.

01:15:32.300 --> 01:15:34.620
Just a bunch of screenshots of games.

01:15:34.620 --> 01:15:36.100
Don't know what they are.

01:15:36.100 --> 01:15:37.100
Don't know much.

01:15:37.100 --> 01:15:38.860
I mean, unless you can kind of figure it out by looking.

01:15:38.860 --> 01:15:40.020
Don't really know a lot about them.

01:15:40.020 --> 01:15:41.020
Just bam, bam, bam, bam, bam.

01:15:41.020 --> 01:15:44.820
It looked like a few a few games I recognize, like kind of look like remakes of like I definitely

01:15:44.820 --> 01:15:47.300
some remakes of old properties in there for sure.

01:15:47.300 --> 01:15:52.940
I mean, a lot of them kind of looked like Android cell phone gamey, but like I'm not

01:15:52.940 --> 01:15:53.940
really shading.

01:15:53.940 --> 01:15:54.940
They are.

01:15:54.940 --> 01:15:56.740
It's supposed to be a cheap frickin console.

01:15:56.740 --> 01:15:57.740
So I get it.

01:15:57.740 --> 01:15:59.860
I get the quality of the games is not going to be Grand Theft Auto.

01:15:59.860 --> 01:16:00.860
No, I understand that.

01:16:00.860 --> 01:16:03.780
And two, there's all the games every two ninety nine to nine ninety nine.

01:16:03.780 --> 01:16:07.700
No DLC, no in-app purchases, whatever in a family friendly.

01:16:07.700 --> 01:16:08.700
So I get that.

01:16:08.700 --> 01:16:10.240
And that's fine.

01:16:10.240 --> 01:16:15.880
It did look like a lot of the games and I'm trying not to like say this in a way to dog

01:16:15.880 --> 01:16:20.380
on the console, but a lot of it looked like, you know, kind of those cheap like, oh, we're

01:16:20.380 --> 01:16:25.300
remastering some of these classic arcade games, you know, with slightly better graphics that

01:16:25.300 --> 01:16:28.700
you saw, like on the PlayStation one type things.

01:16:28.700 --> 01:16:34.620
Whereas I would want to see more retro style games like like Shovel Knight type game or,

01:16:34.620 --> 01:16:40.060
you know, something that's like, you know, that retro style graphics that not necessarily

01:16:40.060 --> 01:16:43.020
trying to like take an old game and make it like slightly newer.

01:16:43.020 --> 01:16:46.780
If you want to do that, like, you know, they have the Space Invaders Extreme or something

01:16:46.780 --> 01:16:49.580
like that, where it's still keeping that kind of classic look.

01:16:49.580 --> 01:16:51.820
But updating the gameplay would be kind of cool.

01:16:51.820 --> 01:16:54.200
But then again, we had it's hard to tell based on what is.

01:16:54.200 --> 01:16:56.540
And I also thought it's still so early to pass.

01:16:56.540 --> 01:16:59.340
I thought that they weren't doing like 3D games and stuff in there.

01:16:59.340 --> 01:17:01.780
I thought it was supposed to be just like 2D games.

01:17:01.780 --> 01:17:04.740
I think you can use like 3D models in a 2D game.

01:17:04.740 --> 01:17:07.860
Some of it looked like it was 3D, like they have that plane thing.

01:17:07.860 --> 01:17:10.100
I don't know what that was all about, but who knows?

01:17:10.100 --> 01:17:11.100
It's hard to tell.

01:17:11.100 --> 01:17:12.100
Yeah.

01:17:12.100 --> 01:17:15.260
I mean, there's some things that probably kind of get to break the rules a little bit.

01:17:15.260 --> 01:17:19.540
But yeah, I mean, it's it is it's way too early to pass off judgment.

01:17:19.540 --> 01:17:21.060
You know, I don't want to sound like I'm shading.

01:17:21.060 --> 01:17:23.660
I'm not, you know, let's hear more about the games.

01:17:23.660 --> 01:17:28.880
I remain open to Amico just because of the fact that the games are going to be so cheap,

01:17:28.880 --> 01:17:29.880
you know?

01:17:29.880 --> 01:17:30.880
Yeah.

01:17:30.880 --> 01:17:33.060
Some of those games, OK, they look like three dollar games, but they are three dollar games.

01:17:33.060 --> 01:17:35.420
You know, there maybe there's going to be there's nothing wrong with that.

01:17:35.420 --> 01:17:36.880
Yeah, there's nothing wrong with that.

01:17:36.880 --> 01:17:38.420
So let's let's hear more.

01:17:38.420 --> 01:17:39.420
Let's let's see.

01:17:39.420 --> 01:17:40.420
I'm curious.

01:17:40.420 --> 01:17:44.020
I'm always a big proponent about I know they're talking about families playing in the same

01:17:44.020 --> 01:17:47.180
room, but I'm curious if these things are going to do anything online.

01:17:47.180 --> 01:17:50.900
I guess does Amico even have online capability or did they just cut that out?

01:17:50.900 --> 01:17:51.900
How do you buy the games?

01:17:51.900 --> 01:17:52.900
Oh, oh, online.

01:17:53.220 --> 01:17:54.220
Oh, online multiplayer.

01:17:54.220 --> 01:17:55.220
Yeah.

01:17:55.220 --> 01:17:56.220
No, no boards.

01:17:56.220 --> 01:17:57.980
I don't think there's going to be online multiplayer.

01:17:57.980 --> 01:18:00.820
I think it's only going to be within the same room because that's what they're talking about

01:18:00.820 --> 01:18:05.620
is bringing the family get together to ice again for the price.

01:18:05.620 --> 01:18:06.660
I sort of get that.

01:18:06.660 --> 01:18:11.760
I'm not expecting it to be like freaking Xbox, Xbox online or something like Xbox Live.

01:18:11.760 --> 01:18:14.820
But I was just kind of like, oh, it would be neat if like in some of these retro games,

01:18:14.820 --> 01:18:18.960
you could do clips or but I guess the consoles just probably not going to be powerful enough

01:18:18.960 --> 01:18:23.400
to do a lot of those modern privileges, if you will.

01:18:23.400 --> 01:18:26.460
But I really I still want to see what the games really are.

01:18:26.460 --> 01:18:30.920
You know, I'm hoping that it's not going to become a new year and that that's my only

01:18:30.920 --> 01:18:37.860
worry because it kind of I'm hopeful that it will be handled well and I think it will

01:18:37.860 --> 01:18:38.860
be.

01:18:38.860 --> 01:18:43.040
But like in the back of my mind, I'm still kind of the ooh yeah vibes.

01:18:43.040 --> 01:18:44.040
I get it.

01:18:44.040 --> 01:18:45.040
I get it.

01:18:45.040 --> 01:18:46.280
Because that was the ooh yeah thing, too.

01:18:46.280 --> 01:18:48.140
They're like, oh, our games are going to be cheap.

01:18:48.140 --> 01:18:49.140
They're going to be inexpensive.

01:18:49.140 --> 01:18:51.220
They're going to have like free demos and stuff like that.

01:18:51.220 --> 01:18:55.660
And then it's just like you you got what you paid for with like cheap games like that.

01:18:55.660 --> 01:18:59.860
A lot of them are pretty cheap experiences, but that's not to say that it's going to happen

01:18:59.860 --> 01:19:00.860
again.

01:19:00.860 --> 01:19:03.860
That's not to say that every time that some concept like this comes out, that's going

01:19:03.860 --> 01:19:06.300
to be the same thing every time.

01:19:06.300 --> 01:19:09.700
So I want to see what's going to be on there.

01:19:09.700 --> 01:19:10.700
It's early.

01:19:10.700 --> 01:19:12.180
We'll give we'll keep seeing what develops.

01:19:12.180 --> 01:19:13.180
Yes.

01:19:13.180 --> 01:19:14.180
All right.

01:19:14.180 --> 01:19:15.180
All right.

01:19:15.220 --> 01:19:22.900
And then Sony has apparently purchased Insomniac Games, the recent Spider-Man game and a lot

01:19:22.900 --> 01:19:25.140
of Spider-Man ratchet and clank resistance.

01:19:25.140 --> 01:19:26.140
Please.

01:19:26.140 --> 01:19:27.140
New resistance game.

01:19:27.140 --> 01:19:28.680
I'd love a new resistance game.

01:19:28.680 --> 01:19:31.700
It's definitely time and of course, Sunset Overdrive.

01:19:31.700 --> 01:19:33.140
So I guess we're not getting this equal that.

01:19:33.140 --> 01:19:38.620
But I'm curious to see, though, because they had even with Sunset Overdrive was an awesome

01:19:38.620 --> 01:19:39.620
game.

01:19:39.620 --> 01:19:40.620
And I don't know.

01:19:40.620 --> 01:19:41.700
This is a great studio.

01:19:41.700 --> 01:19:45.340
So I'd be curious to see what new IPs could come out from them.

01:19:45.340 --> 01:19:50.140
I'm curious what their PlayStation five game must be, because very curious.

01:19:50.140 --> 01:19:52.820
Clearly, that's going to be something in development.

01:19:52.820 --> 01:19:54.340
Yeah.

01:19:54.340 --> 01:19:57.700
And then so some more stuff real quick.

01:19:57.700 --> 01:20:03.660
So they announced the Mortal Kombat 11 DLC fighters, which is pretty cool.

01:20:03.660 --> 01:20:08.180
Is it just me or does it really look?

01:20:08.180 --> 01:20:09.180
Really look what?

01:20:09.180 --> 01:20:10.180
You cut out there.

01:20:10.180 --> 01:20:11.180
Really?

01:20:11.180 --> 01:20:12.180
Look what does.

01:20:12.180 --> 01:20:15.140
Is it just me or does Terminator really look like Arnold?

01:20:15.140 --> 01:20:16.140
Yes.

01:20:16.140 --> 01:20:20.820
Well, even not necessarily term, you know, the T-800, but they also had, you know, Shang

01:20:20.820 --> 01:20:23.460
Zun looks just like the actor from the Mortal Kombat.

01:20:23.460 --> 01:20:24.460
We already seen that, though.

01:20:24.460 --> 01:20:25.460
Yeah.

01:20:25.460 --> 01:20:26.460
I understand that.

01:20:26.460 --> 01:20:27.980
All that stuff's already out.

01:20:27.980 --> 01:20:28.980
Spawns.

01:20:28.980 --> 01:20:29.980
Yeah.

01:20:29.980 --> 01:20:30.980
Spawns.

01:20:30.980 --> 01:20:31.980
Awesome.

01:20:31.980 --> 01:20:32.980
But yeah, like the Arnold.

01:20:32.980 --> 01:20:33.980
The Arnold model is awesome.

01:20:33.980 --> 01:20:36.220
I'm kind of mixed on the Joker.

01:20:36.220 --> 01:20:39.820
I think the Joker kind of looks, but then I kind of went back and looked at like what

01:20:39.860 --> 01:20:44.380
they did for injustice and stuff, and it kind of looks better than that.

01:20:44.380 --> 01:20:48.820
So I like that Joker doesn't look like any of the actors that have played Joker.

01:20:48.820 --> 01:20:51.460
I like that they let Joker be something new.

01:20:51.460 --> 01:20:53.500
I'm looking forward to Sindel, though.

01:20:53.500 --> 01:20:54.500
Me too.

01:20:54.500 --> 01:20:55.860
I stand Sindel in the old games.

01:20:55.860 --> 01:20:58.220
Like I used to love Sindel in Mortal Kombat 3.

01:20:58.220 --> 01:21:03.140
I want more story content, though, with Sindel being in there because she was I mean, basically

01:21:03.140 --> 01:21:07.220
it was because of her that all the revenant characters were around.

01:21:07.220 --> 01:21:11.220
I feel like I'll finally pick up Mortal Kombat 11 when all these characters are out and they

01:21:11.220 --> 01:21:14.100
release that inevitable Game of the Year collection for 20 bucks.

01:21:14.100 --> 01:21:17.300
That's that's what I'm waiting on.

01:21:17.300 --> 01:21:23.980
So then Dead by Daylight announced that they're getting Stranger Things crossover DLC, which

01:21:23.980 --> 01:21:24.980
looks awesome.

01:21:24.980 --> 01:21:28.060
So it's going to add the Demogorgon as one of the monsters.

01:21:28.060 --> 01:21:35.180
They're going to have also Steve Harrington and Nancy Wheeler as characters.

01:21:35.180 --> 01:21:39.500
Oh, they didn't want to put children in because it's a killy killy stab stab game, but you

01:21:39.500 --> 01:21:40.500
put in.

01:21:40.500 --> 01:21:42.020
OK, so they put in the older teens.

01:21:42.020 --> 01:21:43.020
Interesting.

01:21:43.020 --> 01:21:44.020
Yes.

01:21:44.020 --> 01:21:49.540
And then, of course, they also have the Hawkins National Laboratory is one of the their underground

01:21:49.540 --> 01:21:52.420
complex is one of the levels that's added in there.

01:21:52.420 --> 01:21:56.100
Please tell me that Steve is wearing his Scoops Ahoy outfit.

01:21:56.100 --> 01:21:57.180
He's not.

01:21:57.180 --> 01:22:00.300
But that's not to say that they don't have like costumes or whatever.

01:22:00.300 --> 01:22:01.300
OK, good.

01:22:01.740 --> 01:22:06.020
And technically and technically, if you want to be canon with the show, it should be Jonathan

01:22:06.020 --> 01:22:11.420
Byers that's with him or with Nancy, not necessarily Steve Harrington, but you can't you can't

01:22:11.420 --> 01:22:12.420
argue with the hair.

01:22:12.420 --> 01:22:17.180
I mean, and he's definitely more more popular of a character they could do if it's successful.

01:22:17.180 --> 01:22:19.380
They could do like Jonathan and Billy maybe.

01:22:19.380 --> 01:22:23.700
So when are we going to get like a giant like because I get it dead by daylight.

01:22:23.700 --> 01:22:27.380
I think it's not like a 4v1 or is it like, you know, something like that.

01:22:27.380 --> 01:22:34.180
When are we going to get the big like battle royale like we've got like 30 or 40 monsters

01:22:34.180 --> 01:22:36.500
hunting down like 100 people type thing.

01:22:36.500 --> 01:22:38.200
That would be amazing.

01:22:38.200 --> 01:22:41.380
That game still performs very well on live streams and stuff.

01:22:41.380 --> 01:22:44.660
And, you know, it's still like I always see people streaming it on Twitch.

01:22:44.660 --> 01:22:48.980
So wait, I imagine the developers, if they can sell more copies by putting in a huge

01:22:48.980 --> 01:22:51.980
battle royale type of thing, I would be down for it.

01:22:51.980 --> 01:22:52.980
It might happen.

01:22:52.980 --> 01:22:56.700
And then last but not least, I would say this is pretty cool.

01:22:56.700 --> 01:23:02.860
Mario and Sonic at the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020 is coming out and they have this new

01:23:02.860 --> 01:23:03.940
mode that they in there.

01:23:03.940 --> 01:23:05.100
It's a retro mode.

01:23:05.100 --> 01:23:09.820
So it actually has the different events done in the style of their eight bit and 16 bit

01:23:09.820 --> 01:23:10.820
counterparts.

01:23:10.820 --> 01:23:11.820
OK, that's pretty rad.

01:23:11.820 --> 01:23:12.820
I like that.

01:23:12.820 --> 01:23:14.140
It looks like track and field, like the old Konami.

01:23:14.140 --> 01:23:15.140
They have track and field.

01:23:15.140 --> 01:23:16.520
They have like diving.

01:23:16.520 --> 01:23:19.140
They have all of the events are in a retro mode.

01:23:19.140 --> 01:23:24.300
OK, that's cool, which honestly, this right here, I feel should have been its own game

01:23:24.300 --> 01:23:27.340
and release as part of like the switch online thing.

01:23:27.340 --> 01:23:31.580
Oh, because that way it really should have been its own thing.

01:23:31.580 --> 01:23:34.660
They could sell the retro only version for like 10 bucks or something.

01:23:34.660 --> 01:23:35.660
That would be fun.

01:23:35.660 --> 01:23:38.180
But I guess probably cost more money than that to develop.

01:23:38.180 --> 01:23:39.860
I wouldn't be able to make their money back just on that.

01:23:39.860 --> 01:23:41.620
But I love the retro mode idea.

01:23:41.620 --> 01:23:42.620
That's pretty cool.

01:23:42.620 --> 01:23:43.620
Yeah.

01:23:43.620 --> 01:23:44.620
They've got like all the different events were in there.

01:23:44.620 --> 01:23:49.220
I like they had oh, I was trying to pull up real quick.

01:23:49.220 --> 01:23:50.220
They had one.

01:23:50.220 --> 01:23:54.020
It was it's judo or something like that.

01:23:54.020 --> 01:23:59.140
And so they have the princess and oh, my God, that's amazing.

01:23:59.140 --> 01:24:00.620
It's just it's awesome.

01:24:00.620 --> 01:24:02.500
And they put some Masonic shitty friends in there, too.

01:24:02.500 --> 01:24:04.980
Yes, they have sonic shitty friends in there.

01:24:04.980 --> 01:24:05.980
Wonderful.

01:24:05.980 --> 01:24:08.000
All right, that's it for news.

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:09.000
That's it for news.

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:11.260
Quite a bit of news for just a few days into the week.

01:24:11.260 --> 01:24:16.380
So sadly, with this airing on Sunday, we don't know what will have developed in the Friday,

01:24:16.380 --> 01:24:17.380
Saturday, Sunday.

01:24:17.380 --> 01:24:20.860
But I don't think even games comes going on right now is still there's no more news for

01:24:20.860 --> 01:24:21.860
games com.

01:24:22.340 --> 01:24:24.460
You know, stuff always develops.

01:24:24.460 --> 01:24:26.460
There's always something to blog about in the gaming world.

01:24:26.460 --> 01:24:27.460
Come on.

01:24:27.460 --> 01:24:28.460
Yeah.

01:24:28.460 --> 01:24:29.460
Yeah.

01:24:29.460 --> 01:24:30.460
Something will happen over the weekend.

01:24:30.460 --> 01:24:33.820
But we'll we'll catch up on all of that when we come back after Labor Day holiday.

01:24:33.820 --> 01:24:37.280
But believe it or not, we're getting to about that time where we're going to wrap things

01:24:37.280 --> 01:24:41.580
up and go around to get some final thoughts and wrap things up in the studio tonight.

01:24:41.580 --> 01:24:45.100
I hope everybody has a great week off for those that are going to Dragon Con.

01:24:45.100 --> 01:24:46.380
I can't wait to see you guys there.

01:24:46.380 --> 01:24:48.580
I'm very excited about it.

01:24:48.580 --> 01:24:51.580
There's a lot of great stuff going on, as we say, towards the end of every episode of

01:24:51.580 --> 01:24:52.980
Orange Laundrio.

01:24:52.980 --> 01:24:54.220
Tell a friend or two about the show.

01:24:54.220 --> 01:24:57.340
Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice.

01:24:57.340 --> 01:25:03.140
But only if the voices are here to air, you know, out on air.

01:25:03.140 --> 01:25:04.140
That's it.

01:25:04.140 --> 01:25:07.140
Five star review on a site like iTunes or wherever you found this podcast.

01:25:07.140 --> 01:25:10.780
That goes an awful long way.

01:25:10.780 --> 01:25:11.780
Dark Soccer.

01:25:11.780 --> 01:25:14.740
Sorry you couldn't be here tonight, but I'm glad we got you in the virtual sense anyway,

01:25:14.740 --> 01:25:16.700
even if even if we hear you typing away over there.

01:25:16.700 --> 01:25:17.700
But that's OK.

01:25:17.700 --> 01:25:18.700
Do you have a final thought?

01:25:18.820 --> 01:25:23.260
I was just trying to get a few something popped up as kind of an emergency thing.

01:25:23.260 --> 01:25:24.260
So I was getting it taken care of.

01:25:24.260 --> 01:25:25.260
All right.

01:25:25.260 --> 01:25:26.260
Fair enough.

01:25:26.260 --> 01:25:31.020
Do you have any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?

01:25:31.020 --> 01:25:33.780
Make Mr. Rogers proud of you.

01:25:33.780 --> 01:25:35.520
I like that.

01:25:35.520 --> 01:25:40.380
My final thought tonight is that lots of big changes and good things are in store.

01:25:40.380 --> 01:25:42.920
I hope I can tell you more in two weeks when we come back.

01:25:42.920 --> 01:25:44.900
So stay tuned for that.

01:25:44.900 --> 01:25:48.100
Not all of it is necessarily show related, though I am going to work on the bumpers.

01:25:48.500 --> 01:25:51.500
I'm really excited, too, about like networking and stealing.

01:25:51.500 --> 01:25:54.300
I mean, borrowing lots of good ideas at Dragon Con.

01:25:54.300 --> 01:25:58.260
Really looking forward to meeting other Twitch streamers and stealing some good ideas.

01:25:58.260 --> 01:25:59.260
I mean, borrowing.

01:25:59.260 --> 01:26:01.800
Loki, last but not least, sir, your final thought.

01:26:01.800 --> 01:26:07.780
So I like I said, we start in the game jam on Saturday at noon.

01:26:07.780 --> 01:26:10.740
I don't know how much time I'm going to get the stream on the weekend.

01:26:10.740 --> 01:26:15.500
I'm going to hopefully I will be streaming this week, though, hopefully a lot.

01:26:15.500 --> 01:26:19.780
And I've my wife's actually out of town this week.

01:26:19.780 --> 01:26:21.940
So that means working late at night.

01:26:21.940 --> 01:26:26.420
So I'm hoping with the extra time I can actually get in there and be able to put something

01:26:26.420 --> 01:26:27.420
together.

01:26:27.420 --> 01:26:30.620
I really, really want to finish something.

01:26:30.620 --> 01:26:31.860
I really do.

01:26:31.860 --> 01:26:36.220
I don't want to perpetuate this stereotype that I can't finish any games.

01:26:36.220 --> 01:26:43.760
But yeah, so, you know, check me out at twitch.tv slash lokiolar and hopefully you'll see me

01:26:43.760 --> 01:26:49.520
streaming this week and we'll have a lot of fun at least watching me fail if if nothing

01:26:49.520 --> 01:26:50.520
else.

01:26:50.520 --> 01:26:51.520
Yes.

01:26:51.520 --> 01:26:54.880
Speaking of watching things on Twitch, I mean, certainly watching you do that will be a lot

01:26:54.880 --> 01:26:55.880
of fun.

01:26:55.880 --> 01:26:59.560
Also, during Labor Day weekend, keep in mind at VOG Network, we're going to be hosting

01:26:59.560 --> 01:27:02.780
the Dragon Con media track so that a lot of these great panels are talking about stealing

01:27:02.780 --> 01:27:03.940
ideas from.

01:27:03.940 --> 01:27:08.440
You can do that as well by watching all the great content over on the Dragon Con media

01:27:08.440 --> 01:27:13.200
page or excuse me, Dragon Con digital media track page, which will be hosted here at VOG

01:27:13.200 --> 01:27:14.200
Network.

01:27:14.200 --> 01:27:19.640
And I'm told that even the ones that don't air live will be shown later on.

01:27:19.640 --> 01:27:21.120
They're still recording everything in the other rooms.

01:27:21.120 --> 01:27:23.800
There's gonna be a lot of great stuff that that's coming out of Dragon Con.

01:27:23.800 --> 01:27:27.920
Very, very, very excited for Dragon Con and the cosplay and a little vacation.

01:27:27.920 --> 01:27:30.120
So all right, well, that's going to do it.

01:27:30.120 --> 01:27:33.720
We will be back live on September 8th.

01:27:33.720 --> 01:27:36.160
No show next week over the Labor Day holiday.

01:27:36.160 --> 01:27:41.120
Happy gaming, happy game jamming, happy conventioning, whatever it is you're doing.

01:27:41.120 --> 01:27:42.120
Have a lot of fun.

01:27:42.120 --> 01:27:47.860
Be safe and we'll be back to do it all again on September 8th live at Twitch TV slash VOG

01:27:47.860 --> 01:27:48.860
Network.

01:27:48.860 --> 01:27:50.740
