00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,880
This week the Xbox's incredible TV features may have been a few years too early as demonstrated

2
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:22,120
by the release of Castlevania and the In Progress Witcher and Halo series.

3
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:24,800
This is just one subject on tonight's show, stay tuned for the rest of the week's gaming

4
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:29,200
news starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

5
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:37,440
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back it's another week of Orange

6
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:46,080
Lounge Radio live here tonight episode number 787 for this August the 4th of 2019.

7
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:49,960
My name is Rob Roberts joining you over the next few hours to talk about video games,

8
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:54,200
gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle and joining me in studio as she always does sometimes

9
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,600
on cam sometimes not.

10
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:56,600
It's DarkSakura.

11
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:57,600
My foot's on cam.

12
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,600
There you go.

13
00:00:58,600 --> 00:00:59,600
It's DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

14
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:00,600
Hi.

15
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:01,600
Hi.

16
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:02,600
How are you doing?

17
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:03,600
I'm here.

18
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,600
Good.

19
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:05,600
Good.

20
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:06,600
Glad to have you here.

21
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:07,600
Yes.

22
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:08,600
All right.

23
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:10,360
And also joining us right over there on my other side who is on cam say hello to Tech

24
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:11,360
Master Loki.

25
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:12,360
Hello.

26
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:13,360
Hello.

27
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:14,360
I'm here.

28
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:15,360
Good.

29
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,880
We do tape live of course every Sunday night at Twitch TV slash VOG Network.

30
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:18,980
That's VOG Network.

31
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:23,380
The Voice of Geeks Network Sunday nights at 6 o'clock Pacific 9 o'clock Eastern usually

32
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:27,620
right after the Bobby Black Wolf show, but tonight not after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

33
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:29,400
Bobby was on vacation this week.

34
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:32,180
He went to Gen Con, so we'll hear all about that.

35
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:36,840
That's a huge board game convention out in Indianapolis if memory serves me right.

36
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:40,220
It's one of those things where it's like if I had the money, the budget, and the time

37
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:44,020
off work, I would love to go to that convention at some point, but sadly not in the cards

38
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:45,020
for me.

39
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:47,900
But it was in the cards for Bobby, so we'll hear more about that next week when he gets

40
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:48,940
back.

41
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:50,740
But otherwise we're still here live tonight.

42
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:54,260
So we were treated to EVO, some of the finals going on there.

43
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:55,620
Yeah for Tekken 7 I think.

44
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:58,820
Tekken 7 we were watching a little bit here before we went live tonight.

45
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:02,640
So unfortunately we didn't see who won, but I'm sure somebody will yell it out in chat

46
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,460
because of course if you do want to participate along with the show, we appreciate all the

47
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:12,220
hellos, hellos in our chat room over at Twitch TV slash VOG Network and some folks making

48
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:13,280
jokes.

49
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:17,200
Before we go live, if you've never joined us here at Twitch, we have just a couple minutes

50
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,620
while we're kind of getting things ready.

51
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:22,940
So we have a little picture of Mr. Smoosh that sits there while some happy music plays

52
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:24,900
and some folks are making jokes about it.

53
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:31,400
SG100Matt saying Mr. Smoosh pounces into Smash and Darktacilla says Super Smoosh Brothers.

54
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,980
We actually, I guess it's okay for me to say this.

55
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:38,780
We actually are going to be adding a Mr. Smoosh emote to the palette of emotes here at VOG

56
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:39,780
Network.

57
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:42,260
It was actually supposed to be done a few weeks ago, but we've just been kind of crazy

58
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:43,260
busy with some stuff.

59
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:46,740
But that will be something that we'll have in the hopper for you guys before Dragon Con.

60
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:48,460
So those of you guys, you wanted it, you got it.

61
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:50,300
You're going to get a Mr. Smoosh emote.

62
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:51,700
It is going to be very special.

63
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:55,700
It's going to be for the, we decided to make it a tier two emote sub.

64
00:02:55,700 --> 00:03:00,020
So it's going to be a little bit extra, extra special, but Mr. Smoosh is extra special.

65
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:01,020
So yes.

66
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:02,180
All right.

67
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:06,320
And Questbuster clarifying, no one has won the Tekken Championship yet, but the grand

68
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:08,180
final matchup is going on now.

69
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:11,700
The Street Fighter 5-1 ended earlier today with Bonchan as the champ.

70
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:15,700
Yes, I did see that over on Twitter because I do, I'm a big Twitter person.

71
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:18,620
Anyway, we're going to get into this gaming news here.

72
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:24,020
I have a big kickoff topic, some really frustrating news happening here at the top of the show.

73
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:27,740
However, before we get into that, I did want to say something real quick because I know

74
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:32,420
there's a lot of stuff going on in the world and specifically America that's on a lot of

75
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:37,060
people's minds and specifically these back to back horrific shootings that never seem

76
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:38,580
to leave the news.

77
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:42,860
And although I'm not one to really want to get super political here on a show that I

78
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:48,100
know people are trying to escape and get away from video games, where I do take offense,

79
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:52,300
I guess, I don't know what other way to say it, is that yet again, we see talking heads

80
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:57,340
going on television and trying to blame it on video games and trying to blame, you know,

81
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:59,580
what these guys did on video games.

82
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:02,300
I'm sorry, but that shit is tired.

83
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:05,860
It's offensive and it's ignorant and it's willfully ignorant.

84
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:08,900
And I, for one, I'm not going to take that shit anymore.

85
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:11,480
It's not the video games fault, Congressman.

86
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:20,760
It's your fault for continuing to do nothing over and over and over again about these situations.

87
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,820
Take some goddamn responsibility.

88
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:29,000
Do your fucking job and make this country a safer place already.

89
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:36,440
The responsibility lies in the way these people are being raised in our failed mental health

90
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:38,280
capacity.

91
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:44,160
And it lies in this wave of white supremacy that's been flooding the country ever since

92
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,320
the shithole in chief got elected.

93
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:50,440
And we're not even trying to do something about like, even if it was like, OK, whatever

94
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:54,020
people are, you know, really wanting, we're not even trying, like, I'm not seeing any

95
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:55,680
solutions on the table about mental health.

96
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:59,560
I'm not seeing any table, a solution on the table like Congress people get off the fucking

97
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,840
TV and do your fucking job.

98
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,640
That's so frustrating.

99
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:08,840
And even so, mental health shouldn't be a scapegoat in this either, because, yeah, you

100
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:10,600
don't want to put a stigma on it.

101
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,600
I get it.

102
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:19,500
But we need to make bigots afraid and we need to make them pay for what they do.

103
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:24,240
And I'm sorry they took this guy in Ohio alive because guess what?

104
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,300
White boy.

105
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:28,000
It is domestic terrorism.

106
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,760
Call it what it is.

107
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,920
Video games had jack shit to do with this.

108
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:32,920
Hitler was a painter.

109
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:35,560
Are we blaming painters for World War Two?

110
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,120
And that's why you mention it.

111
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:40,440
Well, no, but like, you know, as a vegetarian or vegetarians to blame.

112
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:45,200
Well, now that you mean well, you know, all that aside, you know, there's there's you

113
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:49,040
know, since we mentioned Evo at the top of the show, there's thousands and thousands

114
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:53,500
of gamers at Evo right now, which I would consider like a positive thing.

115
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:54,880
They're having fun.

116
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:55,880
It's sports.

117
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:56,880
It's a great thing.

118
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:00,360
Video games can be a friendly competition and it's uplifting.

119
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:05,880
And it's just I am sick of video games being the goddamn scapegoat, knock it off, like

120
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,720
get your head out of your butt.

121
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:11,100
I'm just I'm not going to take it anymore as a gamer.

122
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:12,720
And I don't think any of us should.

123
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,440
This is not our fault.

124
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:18,360
Anyway, sorry, I'll get off the soapbox for now.

125
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:21,280
But it would have really bugged me if I didn't say anything about it at all.

126
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:25,840
But I know people do want to listen to this show and play video games to sometimes escape

127
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:26,840
the real world.

128
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:30,960
Since we are talking about mental health and trying to stay in a good state of mind,

129
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:34,000
despite everything that's going on, I don't think there's really anything wrong with that.

130
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,040
You know, sometimes I know people say you shouldn't plug your ears, go la la la and

131
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,320
play video games.

132
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:42,960
But sometimes I realize like if it's like what you have to do for your own sanity, then

133
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,320
it's what you have to do.

134
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:48,080
So you know, be just stay informed.

135
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,760
But if you need a break, I don't blame you.

136
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,060
Anyway, let's move on.

137
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:53,060
Let's get into some gaming news.

138
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:55,380
I wish I had a happier story to start us off.

139
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:58,700
But unfortunately, we have kind of a frustrating story starting us off.

140
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:02,180
It's just a different type, a completely different type of frustrating story, starting us off

141
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:03,340
at the top of the show.

142
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:07,600
And this is something that very well could have affected all of us in the room.

143
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:12,660
Because all of us here in the room have prior attended E3 at one point or another as media.

144
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:17,540
You know, some years we went as I think general or maybe as you and as like professional or

145
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:20,460
industry a couple years when you were working with.

146
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:23,720
But at one point, at least all of us have gone as media.

147
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:28,620
And unfortunately, for some peers and some people we all here in this room know, some

148
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:34,940
of our media friends have been impacted by a very severe leak that happened with E3 data.

149
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:39,100
So what happened, of course, the ESA or the Entertainment Software Association, who puts

150
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:42,840
on E3, they hand out hundreds of press badges every year.

151
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:43,840
We know this.

152
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,220
They hand a lot of folks to press.

153
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:48,860
We've sometimes complained about how hard the process has gotten in recent years.

154
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:52,580
As things have shifted from, you know, maybe like indie press and podcasts and things

155
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:57,900
that we do to more like the big social media influencers, the YouTubers, the Twitchers,

156
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:01,080
the mixers, which we'll get into later, and all of that.

157
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:06,820
So what this also means is that once you are registered for E3 as press, they have your

158
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:10,380
name, they have your phone number, they have your address and so forth.

159
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:16,380
And while a lot of people in the industry might have like a business, like retail estate,

160
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:20,020
meaning like a business place of employment that they can put as their address, like maybe

161
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:25,860
they work out of an office in downtown San Francisco or, you know, wherever they're located.

162
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:29,440
Not everybody, you know, especially when it comes to individual influencers, when it comes

163
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:34,020
to the more independent homegrown press, we use, and I know we've used in the past, our

164
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:37,760
home addresses and our home phone numbers because, you know, we're running a business

165
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,580
in our spare time, basically.

166
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:45,000
So the ESA keeps track of all this information.

167
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,680
They have a reason for doing it because they want to make sure that they're able to give

168
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:53,880
this information to gaming companies, that gaming companies can contact you to try to

169
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:56,280
schedule appointments to see games.

170
00:08:56,280 --> 00:09:00,440
And you know, again, we've gone to E3's meeting before, we've received these emails, we've

171
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:04,180
responded and taken the bait sometimes to see different things at E3.

172
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:08,960
That's how we have brought you guys in the past, the way past we were going to E3 regularly,

173
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:14,080
some of the stories and hands-ons and things that we have gotten in the past at E3.

174
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:18,240
Unfortunately this year, it's gone really, really bad.

175
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:24,600
A YouTuber actually noticed on the ESA website that there was a button that would allow you

176
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:31,480
to get a spreadsheet on the site that you could download all of the media information.

177
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:35,280
I believe, and I'm going to be honest, maybe somebody in chat wants to clarify if they

178
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:41,000
know, I believe it was something where you kind of had to like log in as a vendor or

179
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,860
as a participant in E3 to see the page.

180
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:49,240
But once you logged in to see the page, the spreadsheet wasn't locked.

181
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:53,200
So if you had the link to get to that spreadsheet, which of course, you know, when this came

182
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:57,760
out, it started spreading around the internet in not so great circles.

183
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:02,000
As long as you had a link to the spreadsheet, it was not password protected or behind some

184
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,960
type of security or anything like that.

185
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:07,740
Which is actually a major breach of privacy law.

186
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:11,640
Especially now in Europe, you know, Europe has very strict internet laws when it comes

187
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:12,640
to things like that.

188
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:13,640
Yeah, absolutely.

189
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:14,640
This is a breach of law.

190
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:19,860
And unfortunately, you know, the gross thing about the world we live in is that some people

191
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:26,220
take their frustrations out on games that are or aren't made or are well received or

192
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:27,580
not so well received.

193
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:30,860
They take out those frustrations on journalists.

194
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:35,100
And I'm sorry, but combine it with some of the things and the really gross topics we

195
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:37,540
were talking about just a few moments ago.

196
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:42,700
I know a lot of journalist friends that are kind of like somewhere in that realm between

197
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:46,700
really fucking annoyed and really fucking scared at what just happened.

198
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:48,060
Because y'all know it.

199
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:51,460
It happens on Twitch streams and that stuff all the time where that swatting bullshit

200
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:56,100
happens, you know, because somebody thinks it's funny when it's not funny.

201
00:10:56,100 --> 00:11:02,660
And now they have like the addresses and telephone numbers of many big content creators and press

202
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:05,160
people and so forth to be able to do that.

203
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,160
It's scary.

204
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,160
It's shocking.

205
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:12,180
And it's fucking gross that the ESA ever allowed this to happen.

206
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:14,620
This blows my mind.

207
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:20,480
They're putting on one of the biggest tech shows in the industry.

208
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:26,180
And this spreadsheet was out there for anyone to grab without a, if they just had the link,

209
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:31,700
without a password, without some type of protection or encryption.

210
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:33,780
What the fuck?

211
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:40,280
On top of that, giving this information to any kind of vendor at all, just even making

212
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:49,980
it remotely available for use is by itself detestable.

213
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:58,700
You know, then having it be so poorly protected is just more like, let me pour some acid in

214
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:00,300
that wound.

215
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:03,880
Tiger Claw in chat with a comment that I think ought to be addressed because this is a logical

216
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:08,460
place where my brain goes about this, you know, because we're thinking about, or at

217
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:12,660
least I'm thinking about, oh, it's only a matter of time for the class action lawsuit.

218
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:14,980
It is only a matter of time for the class action lawsuit.

219
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:18,980
And this time I don't, I don't think it's a frivolous thing.

220
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:19,980
It is.

221
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:22,920
This is, if there's a class action lawsuit on this, that is not a frivolous lawsuit.

222
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:26,020
That is, that is holding the ESA accountable for what they did.

223
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:30,180
But the Tiger Claw in chat over Twitch TV slash VOG network with a comment that I think

224
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:35,460
a lot of us are thinking, this is going to have a profound effect for E3 2020.

225
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:39,360
Some of those gaming journalists will be hesitant on putting their info when registering for

226
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,540
E3 again.

227
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:45,580
There's already been a lot of questions in the air about the relevance of E3 and do we

228
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:47,400
need E3?

229
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:53,340
And now just add this onto that where now journalists are going to give this a second

230
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:55,860
thought about if they should even register.

231
00:12:55,860 --> 00:13:00,460
Now I'm sure there'll be promises from the ESA about, you know, that they'll, they'll

232
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:05,620
put, and they did put out a statement, let me read the statement from the ESA, uh, ESA

233
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:09,260
was made aware of a website vulnerability that led to the contact list of registered

234
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:12,340
journalists attending E3 being made public.

235
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:16,300
Once notified, we immediately took steps to protect that data and shut down the site,

236
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:17,720
which is no longer available.

237
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:21,940
We regret this occurrence and have measures in place to ensure it will not occur again.

238
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:25,140
Wait, made aware that they designed the site.

239
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:28,900
Well, we didn't know what was on our site or how it was formatted or anything like that.

240
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:33,420
No, you can't claim that kind of negligence.

241
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:35,700
And a website vulnerability.

242
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:37,060
It was not a vulnerability.

243
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:41,060
You just, you, you were stupid and didn't lock the door.

244
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:46,500
Yeah, it was a poor choice, as, as the great and wonderful and pure Tatiana once said,

245
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:51,820
choices. And that's what went into that website design, choices.

246
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:54,860
Uh, comments from chat.

247
00:13:54,860 --> 00:14:00,780
SSU100Matt says the gaming community, while great, such as VOG, can be vile sometimes.

248
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:04,060
Attacking devs, reviewers, et cetera, because they do not agree with them.

249
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:09,020
You know, and I really want to truly believe that that is a case of the way too vocal minority.

250
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:12,060
I think most gamers are pretty cool.

251
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:16,300
You know, again, look at Evo, look at, you know, some of the like positive stuff going on in gaming.

252
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:17,900
There's a lot of positive things to talk about.

253
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:20,380
Unfortunately, there's a lot of shit bags that bring it down for the rest of us.

254
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:20,980
We all know that.

255
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:27,060
Um, Questbuster says, I've seen some replies that mentioned that the ESA was told of the

256
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:29,940
vulnerability a month ago and did nothing.

257
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:30,180
Yeah.

258
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:33,620
That was one of the first replies I got to my tweet because I tweeted about this in the

259
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:34,820
middle of the night, the other night.

260
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:37,700
And that was one of the first replies I got was that they've known this for a while and

261
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:41,780
didn't do anything, which is just, you know, again, I don't know what all the facts are

262
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:48,100
there yet, but if that is proven to be true, then that, I mean, they're, the ESA is about

263
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:50,340
to have a gigantic court battle on their hands.

264
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:55,780
And especially if names and addresses of folks in Europe were a part of that, which I imagine

265
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:57,380
it was, I didn't look at the list.

266
00:14:57,380 --> 00:14:58,500
I don't want to look at the list.

267
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:03,060
I don't want to even encourage anybody to look for this list because it's not your fucking

268
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:07,620
business, but assuming that there are, you know, media folks in Europe that were probably

269
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:11,140
on that list, um, they're going to have a hell of a battle on their hands with this

270
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:12,020
new Europe law.

271
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:18,020
So I, and could that have a profound effect on E3?

272
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:26,180
I, I seem to recall, correct me if I'm wrong chatters, co-hosts, I seem to recall just

273
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:30,660
a couple months ago, there was a lot of questions and a lot of issues about the guy that's

274
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:31,940
running the ESA right now.

275
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:35,540
Wasn't that a thing that was going around in the news about the guy that's running it

276
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:38,100
and some of his issues that are happening right now?

277
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:41,700
I, this, this guy, this guy's going to pay for it with his job.

278
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,100
Watch, that's my prediction.

279
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:46,260
This guy's going to have to answer for it with his job.

280
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:46,820
He has to.

281
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:53,620
Anyway, um, let's see, uh, Questbuster says the dump looks like it was just pulled straight

282
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:57,700
from registration and not scrubbed, which is why the addresses were there likely for

283
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:58,820
badge mailings.

284
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:03,220
Uh, Metal Mayhem says scary thought given the social and political situation that's

285
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:06,660
been enabled by the Cheeto in chief, any of the journalists that happen to be not wide

286
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:08,580
or straight could be targeted, which is frightening.

287
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:11,060
Uh, yeah, they, thank you for getting it.

288
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:14,020
Like, thank you as a white straight guy for getting it.

289
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:16,260
Like, it is very scary.

290
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:20,900
And that's why I'm like, thank God that I didn't go to E3 this year.

291
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:25,700
And I honestly, in my gut, I'm like, were the previous year's spreadsheets up there?

292
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:26,740
Cause I'm a little worried.

293
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:30,900
Uh, let's see.

294
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:35,540
Questbuster says, yeah, Bobby went through the tumult at the ESA a few episodes ago.

295
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:36,980
I thought that was a thing.

296
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:39,460
And Pixel Pockets points out they don't mail press badges.

297
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:41,300
You have to pick them up at the convention center.

298
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:41,940
That's right.

299
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:43,220
I do remember this being a thing.

300
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:46,100
Oh God, Pixel Pockets, are you, are you impacted by this?

301
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:48,100
Well, did you go to E3 this year as media?

302
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:52,100
If so, I'm like, I don't want to put you on the spot, but I would really love to know

303
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:52,660
your thoughts.

304
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:54,900
I know you have gone to some stuff as media before.

305
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:55,700
Okay.

306
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:56,820
Uh, Pixel Pockets clarifies.

307
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:58,660
I did not go to E3 this year.

308
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:00,740
Fortunately, many of my friends did go.

309
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:01,860
Yeah, many of mine did too.

310
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:04,100
I know other indie podcasters that were there.

311
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:08,500
I have other industry friends that went and I, I feel for them.

312
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:11,140
I'm like, what can I do but be fucking mad?

313
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:13,220
Like, there's just like, what can I do?

314
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:16,100
What can any of us do?

315
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:17,220
It's, it's scary.

316
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:18,260
It's a scary thought.

317
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:23,140
I think a lot of the tips and things that are going around online, like ensure you have

318
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:25,060
two-factor authentication.

319
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:28,820
You might want to change your phone number if you were using your personal phone number.

320
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:30,820
Take some precautions in that regard.

321
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:32,420
I think that's all very good advice.

322
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:36,580
I think two-factor authentication, if you aren't a journalist, is a great thing to have

323
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:40,660
on like you, you really, you really, really should have it on like your email and your

324
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:41,460
banking.

325
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:44,180
If nothing else, everything comes back to your email.

326
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:46,100
You can password reset everything with your email.

327
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:48,660
Have your two-factor auth on your email, please.

328
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:51,220
And your banking is probably pretty important too.

329
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:56,740
So if nothing else, I mean, I have TF, 2FA or whatever you call on everything, but I

330
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:58,980
mean, if nothing else, put it on those things.

331
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:03,380
You can't, you can buy, and speaking of gaming, you can do it on PlayStation Network.

332
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:04,260
You can do it on Microsoft.

333
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:06,420
They pretty much force you with the PlayStation Network.

334
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:07,620
I think they do.

335
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:09,940
Uh, I don't remember if Nintendo has it.

336
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:10,740
I don't think they do.

337
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:14,420
I don't think so.

338
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:14,980
Go ahead.

339
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:19,380
By the way, just going back to the earlier thing before, before I forget, cause actually,

340
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:22,420
um, AOC made a comment about the video game thing.

341
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:23,620
Oh, good.

342
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:24,020
Yeah.

343
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:25,300
I I'd be curious about that.

344
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:30,420
I know she's a polarizing people for some, but she's, she's been, she goes on to video

345
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:31,700
game streams, right?

346
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:32,740
Well, this is her tweet.

347
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:36,020
Video games aren't causing mass shootings.

348
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:41,220
White supremacy is sadly the GOP refused to acknowledge that because their strategy relies

349
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:43,220
on rallying a white supremacist base.

350
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:48,100
That's why the president has stadiums of people chanting, send her back and targets Congress

351
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:48,900
members of color.

352
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:52,660
I will mic drop.

353
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:55,780
Yeah, I, there's, there's nothing to say to follow that.

354
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:56,660
There's nothing to say.

355
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:58,260
Um, let's see.

356
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:02,500
Uh, anyway, um, I'm not sure what else to say about this.

357
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:04,420
It's so frustrating.

358
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:08,820
And again, it's like, I feel for my friends and I'm like, how, how can I help you?

359
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:11,460
If you need to stay at my place, you can stay at my place.

360
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:12,820
Like it's like one of those, like, I don't know.

361
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:18,340
I hope it doesn't get that bad, but I mean, it's just like now that's out there and it's

362
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:18,980
on the internet.

363
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:24,500
And when the next dippy thing happens where they decide to target gaming journalists for

364
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:32,020
some bad opinion or something that they don't agree with, it's just like, I'm so upset.

365
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:33,380
I'm so upset.

366
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:37,220
And the ESA, this statement they put out, it's not good enough.

367
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:40,740
And I think a lot of gamers need to make the ESA aware.

368
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:45,060
I guess I could say this, you know, I know we don't have a gigantic fan base and listener

369
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:45,860
base and so forth.

370
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:49,460
We got, we got a little something here and we all know friends that are gamers as well.

371
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:55,460
And I think, I think we need to voice to the ESA that they need to do better.

372
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:58,900
This is not a sufficient apology, what they've put out here.

373
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:00,340
This is not sufficient.

374
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:04,900
You know, what are they going to do to help protect these people that they've now exposed?

375
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:07,860
What are detail?

376
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:11,220
What are the steps they're going to take to make sure this doesn't happen again?

377
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:15,300
How are they going to, to the best of their ability, stop the spread of this spreadsheet

378
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:16,180
around further?

379
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:18,580
We deserve details.

380
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:22,420
We deserve better answers from a tech company.

381
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:25,380
Jesus Christ, that's the most frustrating thing about this whole thing.

382
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:27,860
Like you're in technology and you let this happen.

383
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:28,900
Barf.

384
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:33,780
Sia Tabiri says, would having a PO box help protect?

385
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:38,100
Do registrations for press badges permit you to list those instead of physical addresses?

386
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:41,860
And Pixel Pacas follows that up with, yes, you can list a PO box address.

387
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:46,900
Technically, VOG network has that type of setup.

388
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:52,020
So if we had registered, we would have been able to use that or whatever, but it doesn't

389
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:57,140
like the fact that, oh, maybe it wouldn't have been as bad for us, does not negate

390
00:20:57,140 --> 00:21:02,260
the severity of the crime because like there have been years past.

391
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:05,860
Um, I think with the first E3 was when you and I live together, wasn't it?

392
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:08,340
Loki, the first time we went to E3, you and I were still living together.

393
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:08,900
I think so.

394
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:08,980
Yeah.

395
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:14,900
So I think we put our address on the, the form and on the cards and everything is we

396
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:16,980
didn't like, OLR wasn't registered as a business.

397
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:18,420
Then we weren't with all games.

398
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:20,100
We weren't with a VOG at the time.

399
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:21,780
It was, it was back in the life 365 years.

400
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:24,420
Yeah.

401
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:29,860
Remember later on, I think we, you know, we had other ways to do it, but that first year.

402
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:30,360
Yeah.

403
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:33,140
So, uh, uh, yeah.

404
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:37,380
Pixel pocket says there was a big level of trust from press to the ESA.

405
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:39,220
And now that trust is demolished.

406
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:43,140
I wonder if this is going to cause all media to sign up in person.

407
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:48,340
I don't know if that really would have prevented it, but if media had signed up in person,

408
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:51,300
then they wouldn't have been on a spreadsheet to go out to folks.

409
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:54,180
Well, maybe they would have after the fact, I don't want to speak out of turn,

410
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:57,700
but I would think it's going to cause a lot more people to just work more directly with

411
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:59,620
game companies and not go through the ESA.

412
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:00,580
I don't know.

413
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:02,820
We'll see what happens.

414
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:07,860
Uh, anyway, quest Buster says a lot of streamers also use one to deal with their fans and go

415
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:10,580
to a lot of links to avoid saying anything too personal.

416
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:14,500
But the sheet essentially says exactly who these YouTube and streamers are, who went.

417
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:14,740
Yeah.

418
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:18,500
And it's doing under Matt says, granted, you wouldn't have to use your address, but you'd

419
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:19,540
have to use your real name.

420
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:21,220
I imagine you're right.

421
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:23,540
If I register for a pass, it would have been under my real name.

422
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:27,140
I think y'all know that no parent is cruel enough to name their kid, Rob Roberts.

423
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:28,260
It's a stage name.

424
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:31,620
And you know, I, that, that's, that's who I am on the internet.

425
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:33,060
That's my online identity.

426
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:35,060
When I'm at my day job, I have a different name.

427
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:38,020
I have the one I was born with, so it's, it's different.

428
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:40,660
And it's my right to keep those kinds of two lives separate.

429
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:41,620
And that name is Mr.

430
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:42,020
Rob.

431
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:42,900
That's Mr.

432
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:43,220
Mr.

433
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:43,940
Smoosh's dad.

434
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:45,380
That's my, that's my name.

435
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:46,100
Yeah.

436
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:50,500
So anyway, actually it's funny because funny enough, you say that I do teach classes.

437
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:54,420
I'm a corporate trainer and I do let folks in class call me Mr.

438
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:55,060
Rob.

439
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:58,500
So, cause my real last name gets butchered a lot.

440
00:22:58,500 --> 00:22:59,620
That's all I'll say about that.

441
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:01,300
So I let folks call me Mr.

442
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:01,540
Rob.

443
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:07,140
Anyway, very, very, very frustrating news and not the most fun thing to start off the

444
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:07,700
show with.

445
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:11,700
But, uh, you know, we need to hold the ESA accountable for this and I hope next week

446
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:15,060
we have more to say and they have more to say on this whole issue.

447
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:16,420
So let's move on.

448
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:18,820
Let's, let's get into like some happier gaming news.

449
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:21,380
I feel like this whole beginning of the show has been a downer.

450
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:24,900
So let's talk about some happier news, hopefully in your gaming week and some fun

451
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:26,500
games that you've been playing this week.

452
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:27,060
Uh, dark soccer.

453
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:27,620
We'll start with you.

454
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:28,740
How was your gaming week?

455
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:30,340
Other than the phone stuff?

456
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:37,060
I was just playing Sims for, um, really just building houses and feeling crummy.

457
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:40,340
No, no elaborate death traps in the Sims.

458
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:42,900
No, because you can't drown them in.

459
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:44,500
Oh, I just had an idea.

460
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:52,340
What if I build walls around the pool and they can't climb out of the, cause they can

461
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:54,260
climb out of the pool without the ladder now.

462
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:56,340
Oh, that was an upgrade in Sims 4.

463
00:23:56,900 --> 00:24:05,700
So what if I put stoves all around the, um, all around the pool.

464
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:08,660
What if I put the stove in the pool?

465
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:10,500
Why can't you just throw a toaster in the pool?

466
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:11,460
Cause that doesn't work.

467
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:16,020
Oh, but I could put stoves around it and then the walls.

468
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:20,420
And so there'd actually be something blocking the edge of the, of the,

469
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:21,700
just lock them in walls.

470
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:22,740
Just wall them in.

471
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:27,220
No, I don't want to have my other Sims live in a house filled with pee.

472
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:31,620
Although I am trying to lock a Sim in there cause I need a ghost in one of my houses I'm

473
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:32,260
designing.

474
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:35,860
Have you, have you thought about just having somebody that's like dead in the walls and

475
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:39,220
then like having a suburban family living in that house where there's like a body?

476
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:40,180
That's what I need to do.

477
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:40,900
Okay.

478
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:45,140
No, but I need this ghost to look a certain way.

479
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:50,900
So I have to design the ghost and then leave the ghost in the wall and then have its body

480
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:53,540
there to haunt the other people in the house.

481
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:54,740
Happy Halloween, everybody.

482
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:57,060
This is Halloween.

483
00:24:57,060 --> 00:24:58,340
This is Halloween.

484
00:24:59,140 --> 00:24:59,940
All right.

485
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:01,940
Glad to know some things never change with the Sims.

486
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:03,060
All right.

487
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:04,500
Anyway, uh, we'll move on.

488
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:05,860
Loki, how was your gaming week?

489
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:07,460
I didn't really play anything.

490
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:09,620
Um, I did play laser tag again.

491
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:12,500
Um, I did feel more of that actually.

492
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:14,820
And it actually came out decent.

493
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:16,260
Are they starting to recognize you now?

494
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:18,260
Yeah, they should.

495
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:21,700
I mean, um, they're not very organized though.

496
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:26,180
Like I like was asking today about their membership thing and they're like, I don't know.

497
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:27,140
They'll ask the owner.

498
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:29,380
And so the owner was there today.

499
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:34,420
And so I asked him and he's like, he had to like think about it for a sec.

500
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:37,460
And then they pulled out this binder and like, it's like flipping through it.

501
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:40,980
And he's like, I don't know where the pamphlet is, but he's going to email it to me.

502
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:44,340
And I don't even know, like, wow, way to make sales.

503
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:44,660
I know.

504
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:50,740
It's like, it's like, uh, you have, like, if you don't know what the membership thing

505
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:56,660
is about, maybe don't put a page dedicated to it on your fucking website.

506
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:59,140
You know, that's just common sense.

507
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:03,860
I would think like it says, it literally says, come ask us about the membership.

508
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:06,020
So I come ask them every time I'm there.

509
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:08,420
And they're like, I don't fucking know what you're talking about.

510
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:12,500
And so like, I'm just, what the fuck?

511
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:13,540
I don't understand.

512
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:19,060
It's so whatever it is what it is, but I'm just curious.

513
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:24,260
Like, I just like what, cause I know you can like the very least we can get our names logged

514
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:24,500
in.

515
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:28,900
And so instead of using the gun names, because then like, you know, cues are, which use like

516
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:33,380
numbers and colors, um, this, the each gun has like a name to it.

517
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:37,620
So there's actually agent name, there's, there's actually a Loki gun there, but it

518
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:38,100
sucks.

519
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:38,980
So I don't play it.

520
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:44,980
But there's, you know, they have like Thor and racer and like all sorts of weird names,

521
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:49,140
but so if you scan it, can you be Loki, even though there's already a Loki?

522
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:52,180
Um, I'm probably not going to be Loki.

523
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:54,260
I'll just be Loki OLR probably.

524
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:54,500
Okay.

525
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:58,980
You have a different, like, do you have a different gun is your gun personality?

526
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:00,100
You're like gun personality.

527
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:03,300
Is that different from, you know, your, your online video game personality?

528
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:04,500
Maybe you have a different, all the same.

529
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:04,900
Okay.

530
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:10,500
Um, so yeah, I would probably do something like that and I don't know, but like, I like

531
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:15,300
today we did three hours and that's a bit much and I'm, you know, talking with the kids

532
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:18,980
and like, you know, maybe we should just take a break from this next week cause we've been

533
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:21,060
there an awful lot and it's expensive.

534
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:23,540
So, uh, may just kind of cut back on that.

535
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:31,300
Um, I had the good intention of publishing what I had of it's time to car.

536
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:38,820
Unfortunately, when I moved to this laptop, apparently back in 2017, the backups I had

537
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:43,620
were months old from the current one.

538
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:46,260
I'm missing an entire level in it and they're broken.

539
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:47,860
They are missing things.

540
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:53,460
I can restore some of them that have the first three levels in it, but it's just not

541
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:53,860
the same.

542
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:59,540
That last level was just fucking weird in that really kind of encapsulated the whole

543
00:27:59,540 --> 00:27:59,940
thing.

544
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:02,580
So I'm probably not going to end up doing that.

545
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:08,500
Although ironically, I've been asked, um, by the owner of the place that we go to for

546
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:13,780
my son's coding class to teach a unity class that is silly.

547
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:15,380
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

548
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:16,660
Can you say that again?

549
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:17,060
Yes.

550
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:23,300
You, the creator of zero games in unity have now been asked to teach a unity class.

551
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:24,900
She'll okay.

552
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:28,740
Loki's going to be teaching children about a saw.

553
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:31,700
I think he's never really used to completion.

554
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:33,140
Is that, is that, am I understanding this?

555
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:34,420
I've used it enough, but.

556
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:37,860
All right.

557
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:41,540
That's like, that is like me coaching football, but all right, go off.

558
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:47,300
So I I've, I've, I've played Tecmo bowl.

559
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:49,540
I understand the rules of football.

560
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:50,040
Exactly.

561
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:53,080
It's, I don't think it's supposed to be like anything in depth.

562
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:57,720
It's supposed to be just a few classes, not necessarily like this is a full in-depth

563
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:58,840
course of like unity.

564
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:00,840
You're going to learn all about it and everything.

565
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:05,240
It's more of just like, we're going to make a quick game, a project or whatever.

566
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:05,880
And then that's it.

567
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:06,920
Get your feet wet.

568
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:12,040
And because really when they get into unity, it's, it's like several belts later.

569
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:17,800
Like most of the kids are on just like JavaScript and like intermediate JavaScript.

570
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:23,080
And then like to get to unity is probably a couple of years away from them.

571
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:25,880
So it's just going to be like kind of a crash course.

572
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:28,280
And like, here's what you're doing in JavaScript.

573
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:32,280
Here's what C-sharp is, you know, here's how you use unity.

574
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:38,280
We'll set you up with something that, you know, you can build some stuff for like different

575
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:43,800
gameplay aspects and then, you know, run with it and you can rearrange stuff to build your

576
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:44,760
own levels or something.

577
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:46,200
Symbol is the plan.

578
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:46,700
Okay.

579
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:52,780
I, I think that, no, I completely understand your hesitation, which was also my hesitation

580
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:59,420
because it was like, yes, I'm interested, but I haven't really created anything with it.

581
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:00,940
I don't have a lot of formal training.

582
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:03,100
Finally light the fire under your ass to finish.

583
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:07,980
I guess something you can do with your kid, you know, I guess, but yeah, it would be more

584
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:11,020
targeted towards like older kids, like 12 and up type things.

585
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:14,220
So, um, well, your oldest just turned nine, right?

586
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:15,420
Yeah, he's getting there.

587
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:17,980
So it would be happy birthday.

588
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:18,620
Yeah.

589
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:19,980
It'd be interesting.

590
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:23,660
I I'm looking forward to trying that when that's going to happen.

591
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:25,340
All right.

592
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:31,100
But I have to build out a concept for that game in order to be able to teach that.

593
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:31,740
Okay.

594
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:34,780
I have an idea, but I need to like simplify it.

595
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:36,320
All right.

596
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:37,580
All right.

597
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:39,820
Well, if that's it for your gaming week, my gaming week.

598
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:44,460
So, uh, my video game play has still been hampered a little bit because the survivor

599
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:46,300
LARP still going.

600
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:49,900
Guess what everybody I am still in it.

601
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:53,740
And there are six people left after today, starting from 22.

602
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:54,140
Wow.

603
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:54,860
Congratulations.

604
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:55,180
Right.

605
00:30:55,180 --> 00:30:56,060
It's crazy.

606
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:59,660
I, and I've, I've collected some votes along the way.

607
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:05,100
There was a huge tribal this week and everybody thought I was leaving.

608
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:06,220
Everybody thought I was leaving.

609
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:09,260
And there was, I have to watch what I say about it because I don't know who's watching,

610
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:13,100
but all I can, so I can really always say what's kind of like publicly known, but basically

611
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:19,340
like there was a big play and somebody else left instead with two immunity idols in his

612
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:20,220
pocket.

613
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:25,900
So it was, yeah, it was a big, how do you leave with immunity idols?

614
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:30,140
Because you have to, so I don't, have you watched survivor like ever or like recently?

615
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:31,020
No.

616
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:31,500
Okay.

617
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:36,620
So they, they thought if you have the immunity idol, you would be immune competitions.

618
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:38,620
You win an immunity necklace and they can't vote for you.

619
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:42,940
But in later seasons of survivor, I think the first one was in Guatemala, the 12th season.

620
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:48,700
What started happening is that they would hide immunity idols basically on the island

621
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:50,540
and you would get clues to these idols.

622
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:55,660
If you find one, you can play it after the votes have been cast, but before they've been

623
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:56,300
read.

624
00:31:56,300 --> 00:32:00,540
So if you think that everybody's targeting you, there's goes a chance where Mr. Jeff

625
00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:03,580
Probst will go, if anybody has a hidden immunity, I'd only want to play it.

626
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:04,540
Now is the time.

627
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:07,980
And so somebody will pull out the idol and says, well, Jeff, here's this idol that I

628
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:09,100
have in my pocket.

629
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:11,980
And now the votes for me tonight don't count.

630
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:17,500
So if like, let's say everybody on the tribe voted for you and you voted against like Jamie

631
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:21,580
or something, then all the votes against me does not count, does not count.

632
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:24,140
And then the last vote would say, Jamie, Jamie, you've been voted out.

633
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:24,700
You have to go.

634
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:25,820
Bye girl.

635
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:26,300
I'm just kidding.

636
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:28,380
She'd never play survivor.

637
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:29,660
No, I would not.

638
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:34,460
So that, that would be like the, what would you say to show you had been kidnapped?

639
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:35,500
I'm playing survivor.

640
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:39,100
So anyway, so yeah.

641
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:42,300
So he had two of them because he collected them throughout the game and he wasn't the

642
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:45,980
first, there was another girl that was on the other tribe that apparently was voted

643
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:46,860
out with one as well.

644
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:50,300
So like, this is, this has been a big game about blindside and people.

645
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:55,020
So it's been a bit very interesting, but anyway, so without saying too much and watching my

646
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:56,460
mouth, there are six people left.

647
00:32:57,020 --> 00:33:00,460
It is going to be done by, so here's the weird thing.

648
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:05,500
The finale is supposed to be a week from tonight, but I told them at the very beginning, I cannot

649
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:07,260
do Sunday nights because I have this show.

650
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:12,940
So if by some miracle of God, I actually am in the final two, they're going to have to

651
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:14,460
move it because of this show.

652
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:15,420
And they already know that.

653
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:19,900
So they're going to have to do it either on Monday or getting voted because yeah, or yeah.

654
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:21,980
And I'm going to, I'm going to lose because I'm not here.

655
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:22,860
So I don't know.

656
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:23,260
We'll see.

657
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:26,460
So everybody cross fingers on your toes, but the good news is if you're sick of hearing

658
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:31,100
me talk about this game, it is over one week from tonight because there's just not enough

659
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:31,740
people left.

660
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:34,940
So, uh, yeah, but it's been going for over 40 days.

661
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:42,140
Anyway, um, Oh, some late breaking news, uh, over in a chat, uh, S2-100 Matt talking about

662
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:43,500
what's happening on Evo.

663
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:49,260
Tekken 7 season three, the trailer was shown for some new characters and S2-100 Matt says

664
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:54,620
Zafina and Leroy Smith, who was an original character are the new characters in Tekken

665
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:55,020
7.

666
00:33:55,020 --> 00:33:56,140
So fun.

667
00:33:56,140 --> 00:33:57,100
That's pretty cool.

668
00:33:57,100 --> 00:34:00,380
I was, I wanted to see if there was any crossover characters that were going to do there.

669
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:04,860
So anyway, uh, other games I have, I have had a little time, you know,

670
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:08,860
the survivor thing, because it's an individual game, like, you know, the competitions are

671
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:12,060
a little different now, so it's not quite as much time that I'm burning.

672
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:15,820
Um, so I have been able to play a little bit of games, but I've been playing mostly final

673
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:18,380
fantasy 14, still working my way through the expansion.

674
00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:21,500
I just did the level 77 dungeon last night.

675
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:24,940
And so, um, yeah, still making my way through the expansion, which I still love.

676
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:29,260
Although I will say the quests leading up to that 77 dungeon were probably the lowest

677
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:29,820
point yet.

678
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:32,300
It was a little bit, little bit dry.

679
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:35,980
The story was not as great in that zone, but I expect expecting it will pick back up.

680
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:37,420
And that's certainly not a negative review.

681
00:34:37,420 --> 00:34:40,060
I'm still really enjoying the expansion overall.

682
00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:45,420
Um, and of course the cell phone games, I did Pokemon go community day yesterday, which,

683
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:48,860
you know, I haven't been able to do the last couple cause they've been on a Sunday.

684
00:34:49,660 --> 00:34:53,420
But, uh, yesterday was a hundred degrees Fahrenheit here in SAC.

685
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:56,460
So there was no way I was going to play outside.

686
00:34:56,460 --> 00:35:01,900
So we drove to the mall, Arden mall here, and we tried playing in there total bust.

687
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:07,260
Like, yeah, the wifi or the GPS is not like everything in there as a gym and there's not

688
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:08,460
enough spawn points.

689
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:11,500
And the reason why it's bad that they're a gym is that you can't lure them.

690
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:13,820
So it's just, it really wasn't good.

691
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:15,260
The Galleria would be better.

692
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:15,500
Yeah.

693
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:18,540
We should have driven out all the way to the Galleria cause I've done a community day at

694
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:19,820
the Galleria and it was much better.

695
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:22,220
But the GPS doesn't work well in there even.

696
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:22,380
Yeah.

697
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:23,980
We didn't want to drive all the way out there.

698
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:28,380
So, um, we played there for about an hour before we were like, this sucks.

699
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:32,060
And so we got in the car and I just turned on my Bluetooth and let the gotcha do the

700
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:32,700
catching.

701
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:35,500
And we just slowly drove through downtown safely.

702
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:39,260
I didn't do anything risky, but we slowly drove through downtown and we drove around

703
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:41,340
the Capitol in my nice air conditioned car.

704
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:44,860
And we saw a ton of people, like a ton of people were still out, not bothered by the

705
00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:45,180
heat.

706
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:46,940
They wanted their shiny routes.

707
00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:48,140
So good for them.

708
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:50,460
And I did end the day with four shiny routes.

709
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:51,580
So not, not bad.

710
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:54,380
I still need to trade for my daily goal.

711
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:55,420
Okay.

712
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:57,740
Remind me at some point we'll, uh, we'll do a trade.

713
00:35:57,740 --> 00:35:57,980
Okay.

714
00:35:58,380 --> 00:35:58,700
Awesome.

715
00:35:58,700 --> 00:35:59,340
Awesome.

716
00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:04,220
So, um, anyway, uh, and then I played a little bit of the Harry Potter thing cause there's

717
00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:06,060
an event going on in that too.

718
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:09,420
And I'm trying to collect the green books, but that's all I'll say about that.

719
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:12,220
So let's get into some more gaming news.

720
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:15,660
I don't think there's anything else for me to say right now.

721
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:16,860
Housekeeping things.

722
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:22,140
Uh, there will be no show labor day weekend and there will be no live show the weekend

723
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:22,940
before.

724
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:28,140
So since we are in August, there's really only going to be three live shows this month.

725
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:30,300
We will be our last live show.

726
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:34,140
This month will be the 17th because I'm sorry, I'm mathing wrong.

727
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:38,780
18th, the 18th, our last live show this month will be the 18th because the 25th, I will

728
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:40,140
already be out of town.

729
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:43,580
I'm leaving for dragon con early this year to go hang out with my buddy extra for, I'm

730
00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:44,780
sure y'all can understand.

731
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:45,660
I miss my friends.

732
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:49,020
So I want to go hang out and I've never been to the town where he lives.

733
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:51,660
So next weekend for me is weird Al.

734
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:52,060
Yeah.

735
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:53,740
So you won't be here next week.

736
00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:55,740
Um, but cause weird how you will.

737
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:55,900
Yeah.

738
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:57,100
Which is honest.

739
00:36:57,100 --> 00:36:58,620
Bobby missed his show for weird house.

740
00:36:58,620 --> 00:36:59,820
Now you're missing this one for weird out.

741
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:00,860
So it makes sense.

742
00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:06,300
Um, but you will be here on the 18th and then, uh, what we're planning to do, we're going

743
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:09,660
to record earlier in the week for the 25th.

744
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:12,780
Uh, and we'll be doing a lot of listener questions on that episode.

745
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:15,020
So, uh, stay tuned for Twitter and all that.

746
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:17,820
We'll get some stuff out there because we want to, you know, since we won't have as

747
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:20,540
much news cause it'll be partway through the week, we really want to digest some of your

748
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:23,340
questions and answer some of those gaming questions you might have.

749
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:27,500
And September 1st is my 14th anniversary.

750
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:28,620
Mine and Dan's anniversary.

751
00:37:28,620 --> 00:37:29,500
Well, congrats.

752
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:32,460
So well, if I don't bring him here, I may not be here.

753
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:33,260
There is no show.

754
00:37:33,260 --> 00:37:33,820
Drag on.

755
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:34,540
That's right.

756
00:37:34,540 --> 00:37:34,700
Yeah.

757
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:35,660
Dragon cons that weekend.

758
00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:37,020
So bring me back something.

759
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:37,900
I will, whatever.

760
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:38,700
Let me know what you want.

761
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:40,060
We'll do that.

762
00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:42,460
Um, so yeah, we're going to be not live for two weeks.

763
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:45,980
So sorry to our Twitch crew or sorry to our Twitch crew who shows up.

764
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:48,060
Bobby will be here on the 25th.

765
00:37:48,060 --> 00:37:52,620
So you will have something to watch that night cause he is not doing the pre trip.

766
00:37:52,620 --> 00:37:55,660
Just the dragon contract, but nothing will be live that week.

767
00:37:55,660 --> 00:38:01,660
However, we're exploring what we can do at dragon con.

768
00:38:01,660 --> 00:38:02,860
Not going to promise a life thing.

769
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:07,740
I don't think, I don't think that's really in the cards, but could we maybe record something

770
00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:10,060
or we'll, we'll, we'll see.

771
00:38:10,060 --> 00:38:10,620
We'll see.

772
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:11,580
We're thinking about it.

773
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:13,260
So, uh, stay tuned for that.

774
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:18,860
Um, I think I'm also allowed to say, speaking of dragon con, um, I will be on, I think I'm

775
00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:21,820
allowed to say this now, so I'm hoping I'm not speaking out of turn tentatively.

776
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:24,380
I'm on seven panels at dragon con this year.

777
00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:27,100
And I'm really, they stream those out the panels.

778
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:30,620
Um, actually, yes, I'm glad you asked the digital media track.

779
00:38:30,620 --> 00:38:34,860
So the podcasting track is now the digital media track and they will be streaming all

780
00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:36,620
of those panels on Twitch.

781
00:38:36,620 --> 00:38:41,100
So even though there's no OLR that weekend, you will get to see myself, uh, six of the

782
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:45,820
panels, but I don't, they're only streaming the ones in room six, not in room seven.

783
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:46,860
Cause there's actually two rooms.

784
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:47,260
Hmm.

785
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:49,660
I think most of my panels are in room six.

786
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:51,500
I was going to say we could auto host that.

787
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:51,980
Oh yeah.

788
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:52,540
Oh, for sure.

789
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:54,940
Vogel Vogel hosts the media track for sure.

790
00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:58,940
Um, but we will need to, uh, we'll let you guys know the schedule cause Bobby is on some

791
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:00,620
that I'm not on and vice versa.

792
00:39:00,620 --> 00:39:03,100
So there'll be a lot of stuff for you guys to watch from dragon con.

793
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:05,420
So yeah, they will be, they will be streaming some panels that weekend.

794
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:08,700
So at least you can get, get a little fill and get some good topics.

795
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:10,540
So, um, yeah, stay tuned for that.

796
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:12,220
Uh, as 200 Matt says, wow, seven.

797
00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:12,460
Yeah.

798
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:13,980
I'm really, really lucky this year.

799
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:17,580
I guess, I guess I'm okay to say, I hope again, I really hope I'm not speaking out of turn.

800
00:39:17,580 --> 00:39:19,100
So I'm just gonna say tentatively.

801
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:22,620
Um, the biggest panel I'm going to be doing at dragon con probably this year, cause it's

802
00:39:22,620 --> 00:39:23,580
in a ballroom.

803
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:29,020
Uh, I will be, I will be, um, your moderator for the voice actors from world of Warcraft

804
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:30,540
panel at dragon con this year.

805
00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:35,580
And I'm really jazzed about it because obviously, wow, is a game near and dear to my heart from

806
00:39:35,580 --> 00:39:37,500
hosting horde house for years and years.

807
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:40,140
So, uh, yeah, I'm really excited about that panel.

808
00:39:40,140 --> 00:39:41,420
So, uh, stay tuned.

809
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:44,140
I don't, I don't know if that one will be streamed unfortunately, cause that is on a

810
00:39:44,140 --> 00:39:47,260
different track that is on the gaming track and I don't think they stream all their panels,

811
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:48,860
but we'll see never say never.

812
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:51,580
So, um, yeah, really excited.

813
00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:52,060
Anyway.

814
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:57,180
Um, let's move on and talk about some other gaming news that's going on in the industry.

815
00:39:57,180 --> 00:39:57,980
Loki.

816
00:39:57,980 --> 00:40:02,620
So the Sony PlayStation four has hit a hundred million units shipped.

817
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:08,780
So it's apparently the, um, it was faster than the PlayStation two and we to hit that

818
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:09,280
amount.

819
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:16,860
And right now, apparently that the switch is reaching 36.8, 7 million tracking in line

820
00:40:16,860 --> 00:40:18,060
with the PlayStation four.

821
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:24,220
So it eventually hit a hundred million, probably in around the same time period, but, um,

822
00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:26,060
interesting to see how well it's doing.

823
00:40:26,060 --> 00:40:29,340
I mean, don't really think about how many units are being sold nowadays.

824
00:40:29,340 --> 00:40:31,660
It's kind of like looking at the PlayStation five coming up.

825
00:40:31,660 --> 00:40:32,460
Yeah.

826
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:36,940
So, well, but this is just, you know, a lot of us consider like the PlayStation four is

827
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:38,780
like sun setting and it's on its way out.

828
00:40:38,780 --> 00:40:42,060
I mean, there might still be a few games that interest us, like death stranding and the

829
00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:43,420
seven remake and all that.

830
00:40:43,420 --> 00:40:45,980
So I think there's still a lot of interest in PlayStation four, but you're right.

831
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:49,820
Like a lot of us kind of stopped thinking about how much that sells because most of

832
00:40:49,820 --> 00:40:54,700
the gaming enthusiasts such as us and many, many of you guys, but not all you guys have

833
00:40:54,700 --> 00:41:01,100
probably already picked up a PlayStation four, but we all know that budget gamers, gamers

834
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:05,660
that, you know, can't necessarily drop hundreds of dollars on a console looking for things,

835
00:41:05,660 --> 00:41:07,740
you know, to come down in price and so forth.

836
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:12,700
Like this is the time in the gaming generation where I think some people finally get on board

837
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:16,940
because there's such a rich library of cheap games that have been out for a few years.

838
00:41:16,940 --> 00:41:20,940
And the price of the PlayStation fours are coming down and down and down, you know, as

839
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:25,820
you know, as the gaming enthusiasts who tend to buy the new technology are starting to

840
00:41:25,820 --> 00:41:27,660
shift their focus towards the PlayStation five.

841
00:41:27,660 --> 00:41:29,900
So there's definitely an audience still for PlayStation four.

842
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:30,540
Absolutely.

843
00:41:30,540 --> 00:41:30,780
Yeah.

844
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:33,900
There will continue to be, you know, I'm sure there's people.

845
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:37,660
In fact, I thought I knew somebody recently that said they had recently bought an Xbox

846
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:43,660
360 at a game, like a used gaming outfit, like a flea market, you know, that type of

847
00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:45,260
thing buying Xbox 360.

848
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:49,180
And I was like, cool, there's tons of Xbox 360 games out there waiting for you to play.

849
00:41:49,180 --> 00:41:50,940
Like, there's a great library of games on there.

850
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:53,660
You can have a good time and, you know, the secondhand market for games.

851
00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:56,460
And if you want to get dirt cheap, there's dirt cheap.

852
00:41:56,460 --> 00:41:57,340
There's a lot to buy.

853
00:41:57,340 --> 00:41:58,460
So heck yeah.

854
00:41:58,460 --> 00:42:03,900
Like, you know, and I really believe even if you have to come late to the party because

855
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:06,300
of financial situations or whatever, you're still a gamer.

856
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:08,620
Like what makes you a gamer?

857
00:42:08,620 --> 00:42:10,860
Criteria one loves to play video games.

858
00:42:10,860 --> 00:42:11,660
End of list.

859
00:42:11,660 --> 00:42:12,140
Right.

860
00:42:12,140 --> 00:42:14,700
So, you know, if you're late to the party, you're still a gamer to me.

861
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:19,100
So, uh, yeah, I think that's, that's cool that some people will still be able to get

862
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:20,940
on onboard with PlayStation four.

863
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:23,980
But yes, I'm sure a lot of us are now shifting focus to PlayStation five.

864
00:42:23,980 --> 00:42:28,140
Do we know kind of like comparatively, like where's Xbox one at compared to this 100

865
00:42:28,140 --> 00:42:29,260
million number for PlayStation four?

866
00:42:29,260 --> 00:42:31,100
Um, good question.

867
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:35,020
So while you look that up, we have more breaking news coming out of evil.

868
00:42:35,020 --> 00:42:35,900
Really small.

869
00:42:36,860 --> 00:42:43,020
Actually, funny enough, the Xbox one is not listed on this because they're not out in

870
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:43,900
Japan.

871
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:48,540
That could be, uh, no, this is, this is from like an analyst that they have, like it charted

872
00:42:48,540 --> 00:42:48,780
out.

873
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:49,820
Let me correct myself.

874
00:42:49,820 --> 00:42:51,260
Xbox one is out in Japan.

875
00:42:51,260 --> 00:42:55,500
We just all know it's a non-issue, but yeah, the Xbox one is not shown here.

876
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:57,980
The 360 show on here, but not Xbox one.

877
00:42:57,980 --> 00:42:58,700
Interesting.

878
00:42:58,700 --> 00:42:59,020
All right.

879
00:43:00,140 --> 00:43:04,620
Um, so, uh, breaking news more out of Evo because they're showing a lot of trailers

880
00:43:04,620 --> 00:43:06,060
as things are wrapping up for the night.

881
00:43:06,060 --> 00:43:12,300
Uh, ARC system arc system just showed a trailer for a new guilty gear game coming in 2020.

882
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:14,380
So that'll be exciting.

883
00:43:14,380 --> 00:43:16,220
And a lot of fans of guilty gear.

884
00:43:16,220 --> 00:43:18,860
And maybe that's something we'll see played at next year's Evo.

885
00:43:18,860 --> 00:43:19,900
We'll see about that.

886
00:43:19,900 --> 00:43:22,780
Uh, SEO 100 Matt saying that he's looking at the animation style.

887
00:43:22,780 --> 00:43:23,500
Looks good.

888
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:27,420
It's a combination of 2d hand-drawn and like the 3d street fighter five stuff.

889
00:43:27,420 --> 00:43:28,300
Sounds cool.

890
00:43:28,300 --> 00:43:29,020
Looking forward to it.

891
00:43:29,740 --> 00:43:30,460
All right.

892
00:43:30,460 --> 00:43:34,220
So let's move on with some more news and talk a little bit about, Hey, speaking of like

893
00:43:34,220 --> 00:43:37,260
streaming and Twitch and stuff like that, this is pretty big news.

894
00:43:37,260 --> 00:43:42,380
Now I don't watch this guy personally, just because I prefer to watch friends and acquaintances

895
00:43:42,380 --> 00:43:44,940
and Twitter peeps and all that do streaming.

896
00:43:44,940 --> 00:43:47,500
But I know this guy does have a lot of people that watched him.

897
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:52,540
And so this is going to be some, some big, interesting results from this.

898
00:43:52,540 --> 00:43:57,260
And it is Ninja real name, Tyler Blevins, uh, which is not me doxing him.

899
00:43:57,260 --> 00:43:59,100
That's a well-known fact that that's his name.

900
00:43:59,980 --> 00:44:08,620
So Ninja has made a deal to leave Twitch and made a whole video, uh, that was on his Twitter

901
00:44:08,620 --> 00:44:15,180
and stuff, uh, that he will now be exclusive on mixer, which is the Twitch competitor of

902
00:44:15,180 --> 00:44:17,820
sorts that is owned by Microsoft.

903
00:44:17,820 --> 00:44:22,860
And I think they have been trying very hard to leave a footprint of sorts in the streaming

904
00:44:22,860 --> 00:44:23,260
universe.

905
00:44:24,140 --> 00:44:29,340
I know that mixer is the place to kind of watch the Xbox press conferences and so forth.

906
00:44:29,340 --> 00:44:31,660
And you get your little mix pots and you do that and all that.

907
00:44:32,460 --> 00:44:33,900
But this is a pretty big deal.

908
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:37,980
It's a big deal because, you know, we say it's, Oh, it's just one person leaving for

909
00:44:37,980 --> 00:44:40,620
mixer, but love him or hate him.

910
00:44:40,620 --> 00:44:42,780
Ninja has a gigantic audience.

911
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:45,900
He is one of the largest streamers on Twitch right now.

912
00:44:46,460 --> 00:44:49,660
Well now on mixer as this announcement, but you know what I mean?

913
00:44:50,060 --> 00:44:54,780
And I think that's important because like, I know I saw a YouTube clip where this guy

914
00:44:54,780 --> 00:44:59,580
was on the Ellen show and he was like the face of the streaming community.

915
00:44:59,580 --> 00:45:00,140
Right.

916
00:45:00,140 --> 00:45:00,380
Yeah.

917
00:45:00,380 --> 00:45:04,860
And now when he goes on to these big talk shows and he, what he puts on his own fucking

918
00:45:04,860 --> 00:45:06,380
Fortnite thing, right.

919
00:45:06,380 --> 00:45:08,780
He had his own like a festival or things like that.

920
00:45:08,780 --> 00:45:09,100
Right.

921
00:45:09,100 --> 00:45:09,340
Yeah.

922
00:45:09,340 --> 00:45:13,260
And he was also, was that the new year's thing that they had that they were like advertising

923
00:45:13,260 --> 00:45:13,820
and stuff.

924
00:45:13,820 --> 00:45:17,980
This guy's big enough to have his own fucking festival, but now he's going to be pimping

925
00:45:17,980 --> 00:45:18,540
mixer.

926
00:45:19,420 --> 00:45:24,860
You know, and I'm sure Microsoft paid him a pretty penny to do it, but well, let me

927
00:45:24,860 --> 00:45:25,740
ask this question first.

928
00:45:25,740 --> 00:45:27,900
I'll ask of chat and ask of you guys.

929
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:32,380
Do you, I mean, we don't know how much, cause that's all in secret, but do you think Microsoft

930
00:45:32,380 --> 00:45:37,740
made a good move by assumably paying him a hefty sum of money to move to mixer?

931
00:45:37,740 --> 00:45:37,980
Yeah.

932
00:45:38,700 --> 00:45:39,340
Yeah.

933
00:45:39,340 --> 00:45:39,740
Kind of.

934
00:45:40,380 --> 00:45:40,860
Yeah.

935
00:45:40,860 --> 00:45:43,260
I think it's a, I think it's a smart move.

936
00:45:43,260 --> 00:45:47,660
It's, I don't want to call it a desperate move, but it's definitely a move where you

937
00:45:47,660 --> 00:45:51,420
see Microsoft is like, we have to do something big.

938
00:45:52,060 --> 00:45:56,460
And so this is, you also kind of have to wonder, is there anybody else?

939
00:45:57,100 --> 00:45:59,340
Is Microsoft looking at anybody else?

940
00:45:59,340 --> 00:46:01,420
And let me just shut those rumors down right now.

941
00:46:01,420 --> 00:46:01,980
It's not us.

942
00:46:01,980 --> 00:46:05,020
No one's looking at us.

943
00:46:05,020 --> 00:46:08,780
Come on, we'll pay you one dollar.

944
00:46:08,780 --> 00:46:09,900
I like money though.

945
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:12,300
Well, you do have a very attractive offer.

946
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:18,540
But, uh, no, we're, we're doing, we're doing more than okay right here on Twitch.

947
00:46:18,540 --> 00:46:22,860
Thanks to your, uh, subscriptions on Twitch prime and thanks to all your, uh, biddies

948
00:46:22,860 --> 00:46:26,060
and things like that where we're not, I'm just making a joke where it's not something

949
00:46:26,060 --> 00:46:31,020
we're looking at right now, but it's interesting because even though I do love Twitch and support

950
00:46:31,020 --> 00:46:35,340
Twitch and I stream on Twitch, even as a personal person and as well as VOG network, then it

951
00:46:35,340 --> 00:46:36,620
puts some effort in this.

952
00:46:36,620 --> 00:46:42,220
I can still say this is really exciting news from my perspective, because I think a little

953
00:46:42,220 --> 00:46:47,500
bit of competition and a little bit of like challenging Twitch's dominance is a good thing

954
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:51,740
because it's going to motivate Twitch to maybe do some other things to, you know, a little

955
00:46:51,740 --> 00:46:56,940
bit faster, like the co-streaming thing, which I think is still only partners only.

956
00:46:56,940 --> 00:47:01,500
Uh, I think a lot of us would really love to see that open up where it's, you know,

957
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:03,260
more people can do those types of streams.

958
00:47:03,260 --> 00:47:08,700
I mean, hello, when Mario maker finally allows you to do those, uh, player levels online,

959
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:11,100
I would love to co-stream with people on that.

960
00:47:11,100 --> 00:47:14,460
You know, let my buddies like VG realness and stuff, or Bobby black hole for something.

961
00:47:14,460 --> 00:47:16,220
I think we'd have a lot of fun with things like that.

962
00:47:16,220 --> 00:47:19,340
So, you know, if I wanted to do it on mixer, I could do it right now.

963
00:47:19,340 --> 00:47:22,700
So that is the thing that, you know, Twitch doesn't have yet.

964
00:47:22,700 --> 00:47:24,700
It has it for partners again, reiterating.

965
00:47:24,700 --> 00:47:27,580
So, and I know they're planning to open it up to more, but I think this might maybe light

966
00:47:27,580 --> 00:47:31,580
the fire a little bit to try to push some of those features out, maybe a little faster.

967
00:47:31,580 --> 00:47:32,460
I don't know.

968
00:47:32,460 --> 00:47:34,860
Let's go to you guys in chat with some comments.

969
00:47:34,860 --> 00:47:39,340
Um, Questbuster says Microsoft needs all the help it can get to boost mixer.

970
00:47:39,420 --> 00:47:44,620
Um, tiger class as Ninja will provide a lot of exposure for a lot of Microsoft's own games.

971
00:47:44,620 --> 00:47:48,060
You know, he'll get access to those exclusives before anyone else.

972
00:47:48,060 --> 00:47:48,940
Very good thought.

973
00:47:48,940 --> 00:47:55,100
I mean, Ninja is mostly known as a Fortnite guy, but Microsoft is invested in pub G aren't

974
00:47:55,100 --> 00:47:55,740
they?

975
00:47:55,740 --> 00:47:58,140
I don't remember if they are, they invested.

976
00:47:58,140 --> 00:48:00,940
It just seems like a lot of pub G stuff happens on Microsoft stuff.

977
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:04,460
So would Ninja be playing some of these other games?

978
00:48:04,460 --> 00:48:05,340
Possibly.

979
00:48:05,340 --> 00:48:06,940
I wonder if that would be a thing.

980
00:48:06,940 --> 00:48:11,980
Um, tiger class says Ninja is mostly known for playing Fortnite, but no doubt he'll play

981
00:48:11,980 --> 00:48:12,940
the new halo game.

982
00:48:12,940 --> 00:48:13,500
Oh, I'm sure.

983
00:48:14,140 --> 00:48:19,500
Questbuster says he debuted on mixer with somewhere between 60 to 70,000 people watching.

984
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:21,740
If I recall correctly, that's a pretty big deal.

985
00:48:22,460 --> 00:48:26,540
Uh, and SJ 100, Matt says also competition brings about innovation.

986
00:48:26,540 --> 00:48:28,620
Maybe this will push Twitch to innovate.

987
00:48:28,620 --> 00:48:30,940
And I don't think it's that like Twitch hasn't innovated.

988
00:48:30,940 --> 00:48:33,820
Like if I wasn't happy with Twitch, I wouldn't be here right now.

989
00:48:33,820 --> 00:48:37,980
But, um, you know, I, I liked this idea that it's maybe going to push it a little, it's

990
00:48:37,980 --> 00:48:42,700
going to needle them a little more and a little faster to, uh, respond to some of those things

991
00:48:42,700 --> 00:48:45,260
that mixer maybe has on them right now.

992
00:48:45,260 --> 00:48:50,220
So, uh, Questbuster, uh, responding to the halo thing says, interestingly, halo is where

993
00:48:50,220 --> 00:48:53,420
Ninja cut his FPS teeth before his Fortnite fame.

994
00:48:53,420 --> 00:48:55,020
Oh, very interesting.

995
00:48:55,020 --> 00:49:00,940
So anyway, and bonds 006 says I'm waiting for OLRs new address to be one Microsoft way

996
00:49:00,940 --> 00:49:02,620
in Redmond, Washington.

997
00:49:02,620 --> 00:49:07,100
No, I don't, again, I don't really see that happening anytime soon, but, uh, they bless

998
00:49:07,100 --> 00:49:09,660
your heart for thinking we have that kind of pull.

999
00:49:10,940 --> 00:49:14,460
So anyway, um, yeah, very, we'll, we'll see what develops with this.

1000
00:49:14,460 --> 00:49:17,740
I want to, I'm, I'm so curious to see what Twitch does.

1001
00:49:17,740 --> 00:49:23,100
I would see maybe something where it would make a lot of sense where either Twitch and

1002
00:49:23,100 --> 00:49:28,540
Sony or Twitch and Nintendo are going to form some type of ally ship.

1003
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:33,740
I mean, granted Sony and Nintendo both broadcast, you know, their things on Twitch.

1004
00:49:33,740 --> 00:49:36,300
Actually, I feel like Nintendo has always been a little more YouTube.

1005
00:49:36,300 --> 00:49:40,300
They kind of linked their YouTube directs, uh, directly and all that stuff, but Nintendo

1006
00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:41,740
certainly done the press conferences and things.

1007
00:49:41,740 --> 00:49:43,740
So maybe there'll be some type of ally ship with Sony.

1008
00:49:43,740 --> 00:49:44,140
Who knows?

1009
00:49:44,140 --> 00:49:48,540
I mean, I I'm just, you know, if mixer is a Microsoft thing, maybe it would behoove

1010
00:49:48,540 --> 00:49:53,900
Twitch to form a, you know, um, agreement, a working agreement or whatever you want to

1011
00:49:53,900 --> 00:49:58,140
call it with Sony to try to see what they can explore together and do.

1012
00:49:58,300 --> 00:50:04,220
So, Oh, anyway, uh, metal mayhem says in fairness, if Ninja's audience is mostly kids like

1013
00:50:04,220 --> 00:50:07,980
Fortnite, if Ninja plays other games, is his audience going to give a shit?

1014
00:50:08,540 --> 00:50:12,140
Um, I think, yeah, there would be enough, right?

1015
00:50:12,140 --> 00:50:18,060
Even if, even if he got 10% of that viewership he had for his first stream, I mean, I'm

1016
00:50:18,060 --> 00:50:19,820
sure he would bring in a lot for some people.

1017
00:50:19,820 --> 00:50:20,140
Yeah.

1018
00:50:20,140 --> 00:50:24,220
Because there's a lot of kids that will emulate what they see on YouTube.

1019
00:50:24,220 --> 00:50:27,980
Like if some YouTuber is doing something they'll want to do, you know, this

1020
00:50:28,860 --> 00:50:30,140
I do know this firsthand.

1021
00:50:30,140 --> 00:50:34,140
So, um, yeah, I mean, to a certain extent, yes.

1022
00:50:34,140 --> 00:50:36,700
You may have some people that are like, no, I'm not going to do that.

1023
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:43,180
But if there's a streamer having fun with a game and you know, they watch him and see

1024
00:50:43,180 --> 00:50:46,860
that he's having fun with the game, then there might be more inclined to try that game.

1025
00:50:47,420 --> 00:50:50,540
Which I mean, that kind of goes with a lot of people that I watch.

1026
00:50:50,540 --> 00:50:54,300
So yeah, I could totally see that being a thing.

1027
00:50:54,300 --> 00:50:55,740
It's only going to be positive.

1028
00:50:56,620 --> 00:51:00,380
Um, just to put some things in perspective, some things, uh, from these nudist articles

1029
00:51:00,380 --> 00:51:05,980
I wanted to share, uh, according to Streamlabs data, cause Streamlabs kind of watches, you

1030
00:51:05,980 --> 00:51:10,060
know, a lot of what's going on and Streamlabs is the way how, like, if you do a host or

1031
00:51:10,060 --> 00:51:13,340
you donate bits, the little ticker on the bottom of the screen will update for those

1032
00:51:13,340 --> 00:51:15,340
of you watching on Twitch will ticker updates with that.

1033
00:51:15,340 --> 00:51:17,900
So that way we don't have to stop our show to keep calling out.

1034
00:51:17,900 --> 00:51:19,500
We do that at the end instead.

1035
00:51:19,500 --> 00:51:21,020
Um, so Streamlabs is from that.

1036
00:51:21,020 --> 00:51:22,540
So I know they watch a lot of feeds.

1037
00:51:22,860 --> 00:51:29,180
But Streamlabs says Twitch was watched nearly 23 times as much as Mixer in the second quarter

1038
00:51:29,180 --> 00:51:30,300
of 2019.

1039
00:51:30,300 --> 00:51:32,380
That's pretty big, 23 times as much.

1040
00:51:33,100 --> 00:51:35,980
Now Twitch did put out a statement, right?

1041
00:51:35,980 --> 00:51:36,940
They have to respond to this.

1042
00:51:36,940 --> 00:51:39,100
And they said, they said something very tactful.

1043
00:51:39,100 --> 00:51:43,580
They said, we've loved watching Ninja on Twitch over the years and are proud of all that he's

1044
00:51:43,580 --> 00:51:46,700
accomplished for himself and his family and the gaming community.

1045
00:51:46,700 --> 00:51:49,500
We wish him the best of luck in his future endeavors.

1046
00:51:49,500 --> 00:51:51,980
And then they promptly pulled his verified check mark.

1047
00:51:52,780 --> 00:51:53,580
Which is true.

1048
00:51:53,580 --> 00:51:56,540
He no longer has the little verified check mark on his channel.

1049
00:51:56,540 --> 00:51:58,220
They, they pulled that same day.

1050
00:51:58,780 --> 00:52:06,060
So, uh, interesting, but I mean, it might look like a Dick thing to do, but like business

1051
00:52:06,060 --> 00:52:07,340
is business, right?

1052
00:52:07,340 --> 00:52:11,500
You know, that he, he basically flew the coop.

1053
00:52:11,500 --> 00:52:13,660
That's how they deleted his channel though.

1054
00:52:13,660 --> 00:52:15,580
No, you don't want to delete the channel.

1055
00:52:15,580 --> 00:52:18,940
That's a little much, but, um, you know, that's, that's it.

1056
00:52:18,940 --> 00:52:22,060
He's not going to be pushed in search results or anything like that anymore.

1057
00:52:22,860 --> 00:52:23,180
Sure.

1058
00:52:23,740 --> 00:52:25,980
So, uh, that's funny.

1059
00:52:25,980 --> 00:52:29,180
Nifty in chat says Twitch is a classy ex.

1060
00:52:30,780 --> 00:52:32,780
I like that Twitch is a classy ex.

1061
00:52:32,780 --> 00:52:33,820
All right, let's move on.

1062
00:52:33,820 --> 00:52:35,020
Let's move on to our next story.

1063
00:52:35,020 --> 00:52:36,140
Dark Sakura, what do you have for us?

1064
00:52:37,420 --> 00:52:43,500
Well, just when we thought SNK couldn't do anything else cryptic, they did.

1065
00:52:44,380 --> 00:52:54,700
Um, SNK global put out a, um, a tweet and it says a next gen Neo Geo hardware is coming

1066
00:52:54,700 --> 00:52:59,500
after Neo Geo mini with a modern design and a wonderful play feeling.

1067
00:52:59,500 --> 00:53:01,900
And you can even link it to Neo Geo mini.

1068
00:53:01,900 --> 00:53:05,580
The new hardware will provide you a Neo Geo journey that you have never experienced.

1069
00:53:05,580 --> 00:53:10,380
I think this might be a translation, but who knows what the hell this is.

1070
00:53:10,380 --> 00:53:13,260
They haven't really said anything other than teasing.

1071
00:53:13,260 --> 00:53:15,660
But something compatible with Neo Geo mini.

1072
00:53:18,540 --> 00:53:18,940
Weird.

1073
00:53:20,300 --> 00:53:21,980
They just did this all they had to say.

1074
00:53:21,980 --> 00:53:23,900
So this is really just speculation.

1075
00:53:24,700 --> 00:53:27,660
Um, I mean, the thing that's a little bit more interesting to me is that

1076
00:53:28,220 --> 00:53:31,820
they are specifically stating it will work with the Neo Geo mini.

1077
00:53:31,820 --> 00:53:35,580
So maybe this is just a little bit more to try to get people to buy it.

1078
00:53:36,140 --> 00:53:39,900
Maybe it's like some type of like expansion pack with new games.

1079
00:53:39,900 --> 00:53:41,660
Maybe something that like plugs in, I don't know.

1080
00:53:41,660 --> 00:53:43,180
I'm reaching, but maybe something.

1081
00:53:45,420 --> 00:53:47,980
Maybe, or maybe something that would allow them.

1082
00:53:47,980 --> 00:53:52,380
Maybe they have a repository of games that, Oh, maybe it would be something

1083
00:53:52,380 --> 00:53:55,100
that they could sell other games piecemeal or something.

1084
00:53:55,100 --> 00:53:57,020
Gen, I guess that's true.

1085
00:53:57,020 --> 00:53:57,340
Huh?

1086
00:53:57,340 --> 00:53:57,820
I don't know.

1087
00:53:58,380 --> 00:54:02,860
Unless they're referring to next gen for Neo Geo software, which would be the Neo

1088
00:54:02,860 --> 00:54:06,460
Geo 64 stuff or whatever the fuck it was called.

1089
00:54:06,460 --> 00:54:09,340
Are you suggesting a Neo Neo Geo?

1090
00:54:11,660 --> 00:54:19,340
Yeah, it's Neo Geo.

1091
00:54:19,340 --> 00:54:19,740
I don't know.

1092
00:54:19,740 --> 00:54:22,780
What would you, you're you're you've played more Neo Geo than probably anybody

1093
00:54:22,780 --> 00:54:23,260
else here.

1094
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:24,860
Cause you actually own one.

1095
00:54:24,860 --> 00:54:26,780
So what, what would you like to see them do?

1096
00:54:26,780 --> 00:54:29,500
Do you think, do you think that's in case you get back into the hardware?

1097
00:54:30,700 --> 00:54:35,340
I want the be all end all AVS cartridge.

1098
00:54:35,900 --> 00:54:39,740
I want them to release that as a special thing for everyone who still owns an AVS.

1099
00:54:40,620 --> 00:54:44,220
What about like, speaking of arcade machines, Hey, those arcade one up things

1100
00:54:44,220 --> 00:54:45,340
are all the rage, right?

1101
00:54:45,340 --> 00:54:50,300
What about like a cabinet or something for like Neo Geo games, like a little mini

1102
00:54:50,300 --> 00:54:53,580
cabinet, like those arcade one ups for your Neo Geo games, that would be pretty

1103
00:54:53,580 --> 00:54:53,900
awesome.

1104
00:54:54,460 --> 00:54:57,580
Yeah, but I've played one of those arcade one ups and they're kind of hard.

1105
00:54:58,620 --> 00:55:02,860
They should totally do that in this, have it set up like the AVS four systems

1106
00:55:02,860 --> 00:55:07,020
where you get, you can buy the individual cartridges and plop them in and be able

1107
00:55:07,020 --> 00:55:08,140
to switch through them.

1108
00:55:08,140 --> 00:55:09,820
And I hope the cartridges still cost $400.

1109
00:55:11,980 --> 00:55:12,940
Why you gotta ruin everything?

1110
00:55:13,820 --> 00:55:14,380
Sorry.

1111
00:55:14,380 --> 00:55:17,100
Can't, can't resist those cards for those of you guys.

1112
00:55:17,100 --> 00:55:20,780
And you know, some of you I know weren't really, you know, around or in the video

1113
00:55:20,780 --> 00:55:26,060
game scene when Neo Geo is the thing, but seriously look at how gigantic those Neo

1114
00:55:26,060 --> 00:55:27,100
Geo cartridges were.

1115
00:55:27,100 --> 00:55:29,500
Like they were like the size of a shoebox.

1116
00:55:29,500 --> 00:55:31,500
Like a VHS cassette or something.

1117
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:31,740
Yeah.

1118
00:55:32,860 --> 00:55:33,100
Okay.

1119
00:55:33,100 --> 00:55:34,860
That's a good way to put like an entire VHS.

1120
00:55:34,860 --> 00:55:41,820
Actually, it's a little, if you held the cartridge up at full height and turn to

1121
00:55:41,820 --> 00:55:46,860
VHS cassette on, on its horizontal edge, it would be just about as long, but

1122
00:55:46,860 --> 00:55:50,620
probably another half as tall, if that makes sense.

1123
00:55:50,620 --> 00:55:50,780
Yeah.

1124
00:55:51,420 --> 00:55:55,420
And we've got a few, I mean, the one that we paid probably the last one Dan and I

1125
00:55:55,420 --> 00:56:01,500
bought was KOF 2000 and we paid $325 for the cartridge.

1126
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:04,940
And that was actually a steal when that one came out.

1127
00:56:04,940 --> 00:56:07,100
It was actually one of the lowest priced ones.

1128
00:56:08,380 --> 00:56:09,100
Actually, I take that back.

1129
00:56:09,100 --> 00:56:14,540
We paid $295 for it and that's how we got it because it was originally $375, but

1130
00:56:14,540 --> 00:56:18,540
we've, we've got a, we've got like, I wouldn't say a handful cause one is a

1131
00:56:18,540 --> 00:56:23,260
handful, maybe two, but we've got like a shelf full.

1132
00:56:23,260 --> 00:56:28,380
I used to have a 48 in one bootleg card that I got with my arcade machine, my

1133
00:56:28,380 --> 00:56:29,660
Astra city when I bought it.

1134
00:56:30,540 --> 00:56:33,020
Cause I had an MVS for that as well.

1135
00:56:33,020 --> 00:56:37,100
But, um, I gave it to Bobby, want to give him the super gun.

1136
00:56:38,060 --> 00:56:39,100
So I don't have it anymore.

1137
00:56:40,540 --> 00:56:40,860
All right.

1138
00:56:41,580 --> 00:56:42,300
Well, let's move on.

1139
00:56:42,300 --> 00:56:45,740
We have some more stories for you guys before we get to our walk down memory

1140
00:56:45,740 --> 00:56:48,860
lane in our classic segment for this week.

1141
00:56:48,860 --> 00:56:50,460
But first Loki.

1142
00:56:50,460 --> 00:56:56,460
So apparently somebody has taken the trouble to go ahead and port Diablo to,

1143
00:56:56,460 --> 00:57:00,780
um, the web, so you can actually play it in a web browser.

1144
00:57:00,780 --> 00:57:05,420
So this is done thanks to the, uh, devolution team.

1145
00:57:05,420 --> 00:57:06,140
I love that name.

1146
00:57:06,700 --> 00:57:11,500
Um, so they actually have a GitHub that's talking about it where they basically

1147
00:57:11,500 --> 00:57:16,140
ported over everything, including all of the glitches and bugs that were in it

1148
00:57:16,140 --> 00:57:16,540
before.

1149
00:57:17,260 --> 00:57:20,780
If you're interested in checking it out, you can actually play it at

1150
00:57:20,780 --> 00:57:23,500
diablo.rivesoft.net.

1151
00:57:24,220 --> 00:57:27,740
Um, it does require that you actually have a copy of the game if you want to

1152
00:57:27,740 --> 00:57:28,620
play the full game.

1153
00:57:28,620 --> 00:57:34,860
So you actually have to find your, uh, dhabdet.mpq file to drag into the

1154
00:57:34,860 --> 00:57:38,540
browser windows so they can verify you have it, or you can buy it on GOG for

1155
00:57:38,540 --> 00:57:39,100
10 bucks.

1156
00:57:39,980 --> 00:57:43,180
Or they do have the shareware version available that you can play as well.

1157
00:57:43,180 --> 00:57:46,700
And you can download that, but it's all playable within the browser.

1158
00:57:47,580 --> 00:57:48,460
Pretty cool.

1159
00:57:48,460 --> 00:57:48,700
Huh?

1160
00:57:49,340 --> 00:57:50,380
Good way to kill time.

1161
00:57:50,380 --> 00:57:50,700
Yeah.

1162
00:57:50,700 --> 00:57:52,940
But you have to have that original file still.

1163
00:57:52,940 --> 00:57:57,180
I'm sure it's not floating around on the internet on some, uh, uh, you know,

1164
00:57:57,180 --> 00:57:58,700
dark website out there somewhere.

1165
00:57:58,700 --> 00:57:59,340
It's only 10 bucks.

1166
00:57:59,340 --> 00:57:59,660
Yeah.

1167
00:57:59,660 --> 00:58:03,660
I think that's probably their way of like being like, well, we're not really

1168
00:58:03,660 --> 00:58:05,260
letting you know, giving the game away.

1169
00:58:05,260 --> 00:58:08,380
You still have to prove you on the game, but you know, wink, wink, right?

1170
00:58:09,100 --> 00:58:13,020
So yeah, I will say though, if you've been playing like Diablo three or even

1171
00:58:13,020 --> 00:58:18,380
Diablo two, going back to the original Diablo is not easy because I did, I

1172
00:58:18,380 --> 00:58:21,900
bought the original Diablo when it came out recently.

1173
00:58:21,900 --> 00:58:25,420
Um, and, uh, like for $10 and you know, it's fun.

1174
00:58:25,420 --> 00:58:28,620
I like playing it as a piece of gaming history and all that, but it's

1175
00:58:28,620 --> 00:58:30,220
Was that the remaster that they did?

1176
00:58:30,220 --> 00:58:33,420
Or yeah, that, that minor remaster they did, it's not really remastered.

1177
00:58:33,420 --> 00:58:35,020
It's just like, it runs in better resolution.

1178
00:58:35,020 --> 00:58:36,620
We polished some of the sprites up.

1179
00:58:36,620 --> 00:58:37,660
I wouldn't even say they did that.

1180
00:58:37,660 --> 00:58:39,100
We polished the resolution.

1181
00:58:39,660 --> 00:58:42,220
No, they, they, we re-released it.

1182
00:58:42,220 --> 00:58:42,940
No, Loki.

1183
00:58:42,940 --> 00:58:45,580
They let it run in a larger window than it used to run in.

1184
00:58:45,580 --> 00:58:46,860
That's pretty much what it was.

1185
00:58:46,860 --> 00:58:47,500
Yeah.

1186
00:58:47,500 --> 00:58:51,180
So, uh, it's still, it still looks as blocky as ever, but I mean, it's, don't

1187
00:58:51,180 --> 00:58:54,460
get me wrong, it's still fun, but it's just, you know, it is a game that shows

1188
00:58:54,460 --> 00:58:58,380
its age a little more, uh, compared to something like Diablo three that has a

1189
00:58:58,380 --> 00:59:00,860
lot of the quality of life improvements and so forth.

1190
00:59:00,860 --> 00:59:03,980
So, uh, metal mayhem says, why would you play it on the web when you

1191
00:59:03,980 --> 00:59:05,100
already have it on your PC?

1192
00:59:05,660 --> 00:59:09,980
Because why, why do people install Linux on their refrigerators?

1193
00:59:09,980 --> 00:59:11,340
Because they can, right.

1194
00:59:12,300 --> 00:59:13,980
That's why they do it anyway.

1195
00:59:14,540 --> 00:59:14,860
All right.

1196
00:59:14,860 --> 00:59:15,340
Moving on.

1197
00:59:16,220 --> 00:59:19,580
Uh, this is kind of an interesting, uh, new thing that Nintendo is doing.

1198
00:59:19,580 --> 00:59:22,060
It's like, it's like they're stepping into the modern era when it comes to

1199
00:59:22,060 --> 00:59:22,940
online a little bit.

1200
00:59:23,740 --> 00:59:27,260
Nintendo has announced they are testing out game trials.

1201
00:59:27,260 --> 00:59:31,820
It will allow you to play a full price game for free for a few days.

1202
00:59:31,820 --> 00:59:35,660
If you have the Nintendo online program.

1203
00:59:35,660 --> 00:59:40,060
So the first game that was announced for this is Mario Tennis Aces.

1204
00:59:40,060 --> 00:59:43,660
It will be running from the 7th of August through the 13th of August.

1205
00:59:43,660 --> 00:59:46,700
And if you liked what you played, you can go right on over to the eShop and

1206
00:59:46,700 --> 00:59:49,500
get a 33% discount to buy the full game.

1207
00:59:49,500 --> 00:59:53,340
Again, that's all only available if you have the Nintendo switch online membership.

1208
00:59:53,340 --> 00:59:56,620
Um, this is something that Microsoft's done like free weekends.

1209
00:59:56,620 --> 00:59:57,180
Right.

1210
00:59:57,180 --> 00:59:58,860
And steam does this too.

1211
00:59:58,860 --> 01:00:01,660
So it's just Nintendo is kind of joining in on this as well.

1212
01:00:01,660 --> 01:00:05,340
Uh, I want to say, I felt like they did this once with Splatoon.

1213
01:00:06,460 --> 01:00:08,140
I don't even know if it was the beta.

1214
01:00:08,140 --> 01:00:12,220
I feel like they did like a thing mid, mid Splatoon 2, or maybe it was the first one

1215
01:00:12,220 --> 01:00:14,060
where you could kind of play it for free one weekend.

1216
01:00:14,060 --> 01:00:15,660
And then it was like, Hey, you can buy it.

1217
01:00:15,660 --> 01:00:18,140
But now it seems like Nintendo is going to make this a regular thing.

1218
01:00:18,140 --> 01:00:21,180
But again, if you have the switch online,

1219
01:00:21,180 --> 01:00:24,300
Are they going to limit the number of plays like they did with their demos?

1220
01:00:24,300 --> 01:00:25,980
Because that was fucking dumb.

1221
01:00:25,980 --> 01:00:26,460
I don't.

1222
01:00:26,460 --> 01:00:27,660
It's not in the statement.

1223
01:00:27,660 --> 01:00:32,940
I mean, I guess we don't really know until it's out, but I do think that was a 3DS thing.

1224
01:00:32,940 --> 01:00:35,580
And the switch doesn't really load the software the same way.

1225
01:00:35,580 --> 01:00:37,340
They did it with the Wii U as well.

1226
01:00:37,340 --> 01:00:37,980
Did they?

1227
01:00:37,980 --> 01:00:38,460
Yeah.

1228
01:00:38,460 --> 01:00:38,860
You're right.

1229
01:00:38,860 --> 01:00:39,340
They did.

1230
01:00:39,340 --> 01:00:39,820
They did.

1231
01:00:39,820 --> 01:00:41,180
It's a stupid thing.

1232
01:00:41,180 --> 01:00:41,740
Yeah.

1233
01:00:41,740 --> 01:00:42,700
Well, maybe they will.

1234
01:00:42,700 --> 01:00:43,100
I don't know.

1235
01:00:43,660 --> 01:00:46,540
But I mean, even with 25 plays, that's a lot of plays.

1236
01:00:46,540 --> 01:00:46,860
I know.

1237
01:00:46,860 --> 01:00:48,620
But it's fucking dumb.

1238
01:00:48,620 --> 01:00:48,860
Yeah.

1239
01:00:50,540 --> 01:00:50,860
Dr.

1240
01:00:50,860 --> 01:00:53,340
Sia says, Yeah, I think that was the Splatoon demo.

1241
01:00:53,340 --> 01:00:55,020
I know they did that for Splatoon 2.

1242
01:00:55,020 --> 01:00:55,340
Dr.

1243
01:00:55,340 --> 01:00:59,500
Sia says in Japan, I believe they get Captain Toad for their program.

1244
01:00:59,500 --> 01:00:59,980
Yeah.

1245
01:00:59,980 --> 01:01:04,220
I should point out this story that I just read is from a Nintendo UK update.

1246
01:01:04,220 --> 01:01:07,500
But I think I heard it was going to be in the US as well.

1247
01:01:07,500 --> 01:01:08,860
So keep an eye out.

1248
01:01:08,860 --> 01:01:13,980
I'm sure Nintendo will post confirmation on the Nintendo US Twitter next week if that's

1249
01:01:13,980 --> 01:01:15,180
the direction they're going in.

1250
01:01:15,180 --> 01:01:19,020
But it's still worth noting that they are doing this, even if they don't do it in North

1251
01:01:19,020 --> 01:01:22,300
America right away, that they're doing it in other places.

1252
01:01:22,300 --> 01:01:23,820
So we'll see.

1253
01:01:23,820 --> 01:01:25,820
Stay tuned, I imagine, on Monday.

1254
01:01:25,820 --> 01:01:27,900
Or maybe it is a test that they're not doing here yet.

1255
01:01:27,900 --> 01:01:29,660
They want to see how it does in Europe and Japan first.

1256
01:01:29,660 --> 01:01:30,380
Who knows?

1257
01:01:30,380 --> 01:01:33,260
But I think it's still noteworthy to note that they're going in that direction.

1258
01:01:33,260 --> 01:01:35,660
So all right, let's move on.

1259
01:01:35,660 --> 01:01:37,740
Dark Sakura has more on Nintendo, right?

1260
01:01:37,740 --> 01:01:38,380
I do.

1261
01:01:39,260 --> 01:01:47,500
So Nintendo is going to be holding a game expo in Kyoto.

1262
01:01:47,500 --> 01:01:50,860
And it will be Nintendo Live 2019 Kyoto.

1263
01:01:50,860 --> 01:01:52,460
How's that for an apt name?

1264
01:01:54,060 --> 01:01:56,540
Last year's, of course, was in Tokyo.

1265
01:01:56,540 --> 01:01:57,660
And guess what was?

1266
01:01:58,220 --> 01:01:59,340
It was in Tokyo.

1267
01:01:59,340 --> 01:02:00,140
Just saying.

1268
01:02:00,140 --> 01:02:04,140
But at any rate, they're going to have game tournaments, events, demos.

1269
01:02:05,020 --> 01:02:06,780
They are among the stage events.

1270
01:02:06,780 --> 01:02:12,460
They're going to do a Splatoon music show and a Super Mario Maker 2 stage show with

1271
01:02:14,620 --> 01:02:16,700
a comedy duo called Yoiko.

1272
01:02:19,180 --> 01:02:25,260
And there's going to be tournaments in Super Smash Brothers Ultimate, Splatoon 2, Super

1273
01:02:25,260 --> 01:02:26,220
Mario Maker 2.

1274
01:02:26,860 --> 01:02:32,380
And there will be winners of a Labo contest that will be on display.

1275
01:02:32,380 --> 01:02:37,580
They didn't say what the demos are going to be yet, but we'll see what happens.

1276
01:02:37,580 --> 01:02:38,940
But yeah, Nintendo does their own thing.

1277
01:02:38,940 --> 01:02:40,620
They're like, screw Tokyo Game Show.

1278
01:02:40,620 --> 01:02:41,020
Fuck it.

1279
01:02:42,460 --> 01:02:43,660
We're doing our own thing.

1280
01:02:43,660 --> 01:02:45,580
But they haven't always done their own thing.

1281
01:02:45,580 --> 01:02:45,900
No.

1282
01:02:45,900 --> 01:02:49,020
They had, what, Nintendo Universe one year or something like that, but they don't always

1283
01:02:49,020 --> 01:02:49,260
do it.

1284
01:02:49,260 --> 01:02:52,780
So it is interesting that they're doing it this year for whatever reasons.

1285
01:02:52,780 --> 01:02:53,420
Yeah.

1286
01:02:53,420 --> 01:02:57,900
But at any rate, it will be October 13th and 14th at the Kyoto International Conference

1287
01:02:57,900 --> 01:02:58,140
Center.

1288
01:02:59,020 --> 01:03:04,780
I would imagine that it's probably going to be the first playable Animal Crossing.

1289
01:03:04,780 --> 01:03:05,900
Oh God, I hope so.

1290
01:03:05,900 --> 01:03:06,780
Will probably be that.

1291
01:03:06,780 --> 01:03:09,820
Because that's only going to be what, like five months away from the release of Animal

1292
01:03:09,820 --> 01:03:10,620
Crossing?

1293
01:03:10,620 --> 01:03:11,820
I want it now.

1294
01:03:11,820 --> 01:03:16,780
I know you do, but you know, you can go to Japan and play it early, maybe.

1295
01:03:16,780 --> 01:03:17,820
Pay for my ticket.

1296
01:03:17,820 --> 01:03:18,140
Yeah.

1297
01:03:18,140 --> 01:03:18,700
Oh, I'm sorry.

1298
01:03:18,700 --> 01:03:20,620
Dark Tetsuya says, what was Space World?

1299
01:03:20,620 --> 01:03:22,220
I'm sorry, it was Space World.

1300
01:03:22,220 --> 01:03:23,420
I don't know what Nintendo Universe was.

1301
01:03:23,420 --> 01:03:23,900
I made that up.

1302
01:03:23,900 --> 01:03:25,420
But Space World was the thing I was thinking of.

1303
01:03:25,420 --> 01:03:27,020
But Nintendo Universe does sound pretty cool.

1304
01:03:27,020 --> 01:03:27,900
It does sound pretty cool.

1305
01:03:28,940 --> 01:03:29,980
Should be their new console.

1306
01:03:29,980 --> 01:03:30,380
I don't know.

1307
01:03:30,380 --> 01:03:31,020
Patent pending.

1308
01:03:31,820 --> 01:03:32,140
Anyway.

1309
01:03:33,180 --> 01:03:35,020
So yeah, we'll see.

1310
01:03:35,020 --> 01:03:37,500
Does Nintendo have something else next March?

1311
01:03:37,500 --> 01:03:39,500
Because Pokemon will almost be out.

1312
01:03:39,500 --> 01:03:42,620
So maybe they'll probably have some playable Pokemon stuff too, for sure.

1313
01:03:42,620 --> 01:03:44,540
Because they're going to be pushing Sword and Shield.

1314
01:03:44,540 --> 01:03:47,420
Did Nintendo date anything else for March next year?

1315
01:03:47,420 --> 01:03:49,020
I feel like everybody was dating.

1316
01:03:49,020 --> 01:03:52,300
Well, Animal Crossing becoming out shortly after that.

1317
01:03:52,300 --> 01:03:53,980
No, Animal Crossing is March.

1318
01:03:53,980 --> 01:03:55,180
Oh, is that March?

1319
01:03:55,180 --> 01:03:55,740
Yeah.

1320
01:03:55,740 --> 01:03:56,300
Oh, okay.

1321
01:03:56,300 --> 01:03:58,540
No, it's Pokemon that's out shortly after that.

1322
01:03:58,540 --> 01:04:01,660
So Pokemon would seem like, sureably, it's part of the event as well.

1323
01:04:02,620 --> 01:04:04,700
I mean, they might unveil something new.

1324
01:04:04,700 --> 01:04:05,980
There might be a surprise.

1325
01:04:05,980 --> 01:04:08,140
I mean, it's Pikmin 5.

1326
01:04:08,140 --> 01:04:08,620
Who knows?

1327
01:04:08,620 --> 01:04:11,260
It's Luigi's Mansion 4.

1328
01:04:11,980 --> 01:04:14,060
Let's make more sequels for those games.

1329
01:04:14,060 --> 01:04:17,500
Quest Buster also points out that Nintendo is also going to be a Gamescom.

1330
01:04:17,500 --> 01:04:21,420
That's not terribly surprising, but I imagine they're going to bring a similar setup to

1331
01:04:21,420 --> 01:04:25,340
what they had at E3 and what's been traveling around the country with the Nintendo.

1332
01:04:25,900 --> 01:04:28,300
You know, experience that they were that they had at the State Fair,

1333
01:04:28,300 --> 01:04:29,980
which I missed out on and all that other stuff.

1334
01:04:29,980 --> 01:04:30,380
Yeah.

1335
01:04:30,380 --> 01:04:31,100
Yeah.

1336
01:04:31,100 --> 01:04:31,740
So we'll see.

1337
01:04:32,300 --> 01:04:35,500
I would have gone to the State Fair, but I ended up being out of town for the last week.

1338
01:04:35,500 --> 01:04:35,820
Yeah.

1339
01:04:35,820 --> 01:04:36,860
With that surprise trip.

1340
01:04:36,860 --> 01:04:38,700
So anyway, all right.

1341
01:04:39,580 --> 01:04:40,540
Moving on, Loki.

1342
01:04:41,180 --> 01:04:48,780
So there's some more Labo VR support now for Captain Toad Treasure Tracker.

1343
01:04:48,780 --> 01:04:53,340
So apparently with the version 1.3.0 update,

1344
01:04:53,900 --> 01:04:58,380
you're able to actually play a version of the game that is compatible with that.

1345
01:04:58,380 --> 01:05:05,100
So you have the seroscopic 3D and you can rotate around the different levels in a 360 degree view.

1346
01:05:06,540 --> 01:05:07,020
I don't know.

1347
01:05:10,780 --> 01:05:12,540
It's cool that they added that.

1348
01:05:12,540 --> 01:05:13,500
They didn't have to do that.

1349
01:05:13,500 --> 01:05:16,060
But this is not going to catch on.

1350
01:05:16,060 --> 01:05:16,860
It really isn't.

1351
01:05:16,860 --> 01:05:21,180
The Mario Odyssey stuff was kind of OK.

1352
01:05:21,820 --> 01:05:22,700
It wasn't very good.

1353
01:05:23,900 --> 01:05:26,540
I haven't tried the Legends, all this stuff.

1354
01:05:26,540 --> 01:05:28,540
But I hear that's not good.

1355
01:05:28,540 --> 01:05:30,780
And I can't imagine that this is going to be that great.

1356
01:05:31,740 --> 01:05:33,420
The games themselves are all right.

1357
01:05:33,420 --> 01:05:36,140
The Labo VR stuff.

1358
01:05:36,140 --> 01:05:37,980
But I don't know.

1359
01:05:37,980 --> 01:05:43,260
That Labo stuff just kind of gets boring pretty fast, unfortunately.

1360
01:05:44,380 --> 01:05:44,700
Yeah.

1361
01:05:44,700 --> 01:05:48,460
I mean, I guess it's cool that they went back and they patched in the support to try to like,

1362
01:05:48,460 --> 01:05:52,780
you know, I like it when Nintendo tries to bring more value to their old games.

1363
01:05:52,780 --> 01:05:55,980
And, you know, titles that have been out a little bit with like a surprise patch or something.

1364
01:05:55,980 --> 01:05:57,740
But is this really added value?

1365
01:05:58,460 --> 01:05:59,820
Because it didn't end up that way in the end.

1366
01:05:59,820 --> 01:06:03,820
Well, I'm assuming that this stuff is probably not flying off store shelves anymore.

1367
01:06:04,460 --> 01:06:10,540
If you can find a version of Labo, like if you want to check it out, the VR stuff,

1368
01:06:10,540 --> 01:06:15,820
I'd recommend getting just that 40 dollar one with the like blaster gun thing.

1369
01:06:15,820 --> 01:06:18,860
That was actually probably one of the more fun games that they had in there.

1370
01:06:19,340 --> 01:06:23,260
Um, that'd probably be worth your money if you can get it cheaper than 40 bucks,

1371
01:06:23,260 --> 01:06:25,420
which I think is what the retail is on it now.

1372
01:06:26,220 --> 01:06:29,980
Maybe when it drops down to 20 might not be a bad deal.

1373
01:06:29,980 --> 01:06:34,700
But yeah, don't definitely don't buy it for Captain Toad's Treasure Tracker.

1374
01:06:35,820 --> 01:06:39,580
No, I did finally see one of those things on the shelf the other day, though,

1375
01:06:39,580 --> 01:06:41,020
because, you know, they were hard to get for a while.

1376
01:06:41,020 --> 01:06:43,260
But now they're they seem to be a little more available.

1377
01:06:43,260 --> 01:06:43,580
Yeah.

1378
01:06:43,580 --> 01:06:44,460
So, yeah.

1379
01:06:44,460 --> 01:06:45,180
All right.

1380
01:06:45,180 --> 01:06:46,140
Well, let's move on.

1381
01:06:46,220 --> 01:06:50,940
And something that is not going to be available much longer is the YouTube app on the 3DS.

1382
01:06:51,500 --> 01:06:55,660
It will be closing on September 3rd, 2019.

1383
01:06:55,660 --> 01:06:59,180
So if you are still using your 3DS for YouTube, which, you know,

1384
01:06:59,180 --> 01:07:02,780
I can't imagine there's a lot of people, but I could I could see like maybe like kids,

1385
01:07:02,780 --> 01:07:04,860
you know, your kids if they didn't have a tablet.

1386
01:07:04,860 --> 01:07:05,980
But yeah, OK.

1387
01:07:05,980 --> 01:07:08,060
But they but they have another device that they can use.

1388
01:07:08,060 --> 01:07:08,380
Yeah.

1389
01:07:08,380 --> 01:07:10,540
And I guess a lot of folks probably do in that situation.

1390
01:07:11,180 --> 01:07:15,020
So Nintendo did confirm that YouTube will no longer be available to download or

1391
01:07:15,020 --> 01:07:17,260
function after September 3rd.

1392
01:07:17,260 --> 01:07:20,380
And apparently the app has been having issues for a while anyway,

1393
01:07:21,100 --> 01:07:24,460
as I'm sure YouTube has been doing their own upgrades and things behind the scenes.

1394
01:07:25,100 --> 01:07:30,460
Maintaining the 3DS and as a platform is probably not their highest priority,

1395
01:07:31,260 --> 01:07:35,180
as dark Tetsuya puts it in our chat at Twitch TV slash VOG Network.

1396
01:07:35,180 --> 01:07:39,340
If you needed any more proof that the 3DS is on the way out, you're looking at it.

1397
01:07:39,340 --> 01:07:39,660
Yep.

1398
01:07:39,660 --> 01:07:41,180
It's another kind of nail in the coffin.

1399
01:07:41,180 --> 01:07:41,660
Right.

1400
01:07:41,660 --> 01:07:47,660
So see a YouTube app is available on the switch, which I imagine a lot of people are,

1401
01:07:47,660 --> 01:07:51,660
you know, they're nudging them to upgrade to, especially with the switch light soon on the way.

1402
01:07:51,660 --> 01:07:54,300
I think Nintendo would just love it if you replace

1403
01:07:54,300 --> 01:07:58,380
your 3DS with one of those devices, if you must have YouTube.

1404
01:07:58,380 --> 01:08:00,460
But like you said, a lot of people have a tablet.

1405
01:08:00,460 --> 01:08:02,540
A lot of people do YouTube on their phones.

1406
01:08:02,540 --> 01:08:05,340
I imagine it was probably mostly kids with 2DS at this point.

1407
01:08:05,340 --> 01:08:06,940
They were probably still using YouTube.

1408
01:08:06,940 --> 01:08:12,540
So as Joe and Hunter Matt says, to be honest, the YouTube app on 3DS was kind of bad to begin with,

1409
01:08:12,540 --> 01:08:14,460
and they didn't really provide updates to it.

1410
01:08:14,460 --> 01:08:17,500
So no big loss, I guess, for a lot of people.

1411
01:08:17,500 --> 01:08:19,660
But I'm sure there's going to be that one person out there that was like,

1412
01:08:19,660 --> 01:08:20,780
but I was using it.

1413
01:08:21,900 --> 01:08:25,900
And they'll be sad, but hopefully they'll find a new device to do their YouTube's on.

1414
01:08:26,620 --> 01:08:28,060
All right, let's take it.

1415
01:08:28,060 --> 01:08:29,500
Let's take a step back in time.

1416
01:08:29,500 --> 01:08:34,380
Let's go back to games that are still out and are still available and things that can still be

1417
01:08:34,380 --> 01:08:37,740
played if you find this at a flea market.

1418
01:08:37,740 --> 01:08:41,420
We're going to take a trip down memory lane with the classic game of the week.

1419
01:08:41,420 --> 01:08:44,860
Every week, Dark Soccer steps into the gaming vault and finds a game that she thinks,

1420
01:08:44,860 --> 01:08:47,180
hey, you guys should check this shit out.

1421
01:08:47,180 --> 01:08:55,020
But once a month in a 2019 twist, once a month, Dark Soccer instead highlights a soundtrack.

1422
01:08:55,020 --> 01:08:58,300
In fact, this year, it's 8-bit soundtracks that she thinks,

1423
01:08:58,300 --> 01:09:00,460
listen up because this is some good music.

1424
01:09:00,460 --> 01:09:01,740
So Dark Soccer is important.

1425
01:09:01,740 --> 01:09:03,020
This means something.

1426
01:09:03,020 --> 01:09:05,020
What is the classic soundtrack of the month?

1427
01:09:05,020 --> 01:09:06,140
Blaster Master.

1428
01:09:06,140 --> 01:09:07,020
Great pick.

1429
01:09:07,020 --> 01:09:07,520
Yeah.

1430
01:09:08,140 --> 01:09:11,500
And I had the music running through my head earlier today and I'm like,

1431
01:09:11,500 --> 01:09:13,980
oh shit, I haven't done Blaster Master for music.

1432
01:09:17,980 --> 01:09:19,100
Isn't this the best?

1433
01:09:19,100 --> 01:09:19,820
It really is.

1434
01:09:20,860 --> 01:09:21,360
Anyway.

1435
01:09:22,620 --> 01:09:25,180
Chat, let me know if the audio is too loud.

1436
01:09:25,180 --> 01:09:28,220
I think it's a little louder than usual, but I don't think it's too loud.

1437
01:09:28,220 --> 01:09:31,260
Well, anyway, Blaster Master came out in 1988.

1438
01:09:32,220 --> 01:09:35,580
Of course, on the Nintendo Entertainment System, or Famicom.

1439
01:09:36,380 --> 01:09:40,780
And it really was very adventurous music.

1440
01:09:40,780 --> 01:09:43,260
I mean, it made me feel like you were on a quest.

1441
01:09:44,140 --> 01:09:47,180
And heroically on a quest, I might add.

1442
01:09:47,980 --> 01:09:54,540
So at any rate, the music was actually composed by Kodaka Naoki.

1443
01:09:55,420 --> 01:09:59,820
Other games that he did that people might know were,

1444
01:10:02,780 --> 01:10:04,540
let's see, Route 16 Turbo.

1445
01:10:05,340 --> 01:10:08,060
A lot of these only came out in Japan.

1446
01:10:08,060 --> 01:10:10,540
Spy Hunter, but of course that's also a Peter Gunn theme.

1447
01:10:14,140 --> 01:10:16,380
There was Dead Zone.

1448
01:10:16,380 --> 01:10:17,740
I'm trying to think of some other ones.

1449
01:10:17,740 --> 01:10:18,540
Freedom Force.

1450
01:10:19,420 --> 01:10:21,340
Blaster Master, as we just said here.

1451
01:10:22,220 --> 01:10:23,420
After Burner for Famicom.

1452
01:10:24,220 --> 01:10:24,720
Batman.

1453
01:10:25,580 --> 01:10:26,700
Fester's Quest.

1454
01:10:26,700 --> 01:10:28,220
City Hunter for PC Engine.

1455
01:10:29,020 --> 01:10:29,980
Journey to Silius.

1456
01:10:31,100 --> 01:10:33,340
Remember, I brought that one up as a game.

1457
01:10:35,020 --> 01:10:36,460
So this guy gets a gold star.

1458
01:10:37,100 --> 01:10:38,540
Super Spy Hunter.

1459
01:10:38,540 --> 01:10:41,260
He did a bunch of Batman games.

1460
01:10:41,260 --> 01:10:44,220
And he also did Super Fantasy Zone for the Genesis.

1461
01:10:44,220 --> 01:10:47,100
So of course, he's instantly awesome sauce.

1462
01:10:48,060 --> 01:10:51,580
As far as those others who worked on the game,

1463
01:10:53,100 --> 01:10:56,860
we actually have for our sound programmer,

1464
01:10:56,860 --> 01:10:58,620
we have Morita Nagisa.

1465
01:10:58,620 --> 01:11:03,660
We have also for the music driver, Seya Shinichi.

1466
01:11:03,660 --> 01:11:07,900
So just really good team in all of these,

1467
01:11:07,900 --> 01:11:09,020
you know, in various different ways.

1468
01:11:09,020 --> 01:11:12,220
We worked on the music for a bunch of different really good games.

1469
01:11:12,940 --> 01:11:17,500
So I really can't say too much else, you know,

1470
01:11:17,500 --> 01:11:19,820
about how awesome the music is.

1471
01:11:20,540 --> 01:11:21,500
It's all iconic.

1472
01:11:21,500 --> 01:11:22,620
Every level is, of course,

1473
01:11:22,620 --> 01:11:24,300
but none more so than the very first one

1474
01:11:24,300 --> 01:11:26,540
where everyone has played that level.

1475
01:11:26,540 --> 01:11:27,260
And so there you go.

1476
01:11:28,540 --> 01:11:29,900
It's Blaster Master.

1477
01:11:31,420 --> 01:11:33,500
That is your classic game or classic game soundtrack.

1478
01:11:35,180 --> 01:11:38,140
And, you know, although I would encourage everybody

1479
01:11:38,140 --> 01:11:39,580
to go find the old version of this,

1480
01:11:39,580 --> 01:11:41,820
it's on like Wii Virtual Comedy.

1481
01:11:41,820 --> 01:11:42,940
Obviously, that won't do you any good anymore,

1482
01:11:42,940 --> 01:11:45,100
but I think it was on Wii U's Virtual Console as well,

1483
01:11:45,100 --> 01:11:45,980
if I remember right.

1484
01:11:46,540 --> 01:11:48,780
And then, of course, there's the remake, Blaster Master Zero,

1485
01:11:48,780 --> 01:11:52,140
which, you know, as far as remakes go, it's not bad.

1486
01:11:52,940 --> 01:11:55,660
And, you know, the way they reinterpreted the music and all that,

1487
01:11:55,660 --> 01:11:57,180
they still did a pretty good job.

1488
01:11:57,180 --> 01:11:59,420
So, you know, it's certainly better than nothing.

1489
01:11:59,420 --> 01:12:01,740
Yeah, I could sit and listen to this all day.

1490
01:12:01,740 --> 01:12:02,300
Yeah.

1491
01:12:02,300 --> 01:12:03,980
Oh, and of course, start to see it points out,

1492
01:12:03,980 --> 01:12:05,980
it is part of the Switch Online service.

1493
01:12:05,980 --> 01:12:07,580
So if you have the classic NES library,

1494
01:12:07,580 --> 01:12:08,620
you already have access to this.

1495
01:12:08,620 --> 01:12:09,580
So go play it.

1496
01:12:09,580 --> 01:12:10,080
Yay.

1497
01:12:11,040 --> 01:12:12,160
And, you know, some of these,

1498
01:12:12,160 --> 01:12:14,000
like now that we're getting into some of the later stages,

1499
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:15,520
like everybody knows the stage one music,

1500
01:12:15,520 --> 01:12:18,400
but I think this is, excuse me, stage three of this play right now.

1501
01:12:19,040 --> 01:12:20,720
Yeah, there's a lot of great songs.

1502
01:12:21,520 --> 01:12:22,640
If you get that far.

1503
01:12:22,640 --> 01:12:24,080
Yeah, if you can get that far.

1504
01:12:24,080 --> 01:12:30,240
But thanks to, excuse me, thanks to Switch Online and so forth,

1505
01:12:30,240 --> 01:12:31,920
you know, you can use the save states and stuff.

1506
01:12:31,920 --> 01:12:34,240
And I think that rewind features out now,

1507
01:12:34,240 --> 01:12:36,960
so help you out a little bit with some of those harder fights.

1508
01:12:36,960 --> 01:12:37,460
Agreed.

1509
01:12:38,420 --> 01:12:40,740
There it is, your classic soundtrack of the month,

1510
01:12:41,380 --> 01:12:44,900
Blaster Master, 8-bit soundtrack for the NES.

1511
01:12:44,900 --> 01:12:46,980
If they did like a Pokemon version,

1512
01:12:46,980 --> 01:12:48,740
they could do Blast Hoistmaster.

1513
01:12:50,820 --> 01:12:51,940
I'd play it.

1514
01:12:51,940 --> 01:12:52,820
Noted.

1515
01:12:52,820 --> 01:12:54,500
All right, we're going to move on.

1516
01:12:54,500 --> 01:12:56,980
Let's get into some rapid fire news

1517
01:12:56,980 --> 01:13:00,260
and quickly travel around the gaming sphere

1518
01:13:00,260 --> 01:13:01,780
and check out some quick news.

1519
01:13:01,780 --> 01:13:02,580
Loki.

1520
01:13:02,580 --> 01:13:06,980
So our awesome games that we're going to get for August,

1521
01:13:07,060 --> 01:13:09,060
starting with PlayStation Plus.

1522
01:13:09,060 --> 01:13:12,260
Sniper Elite 4 and the Wipeout Omega Collection

1523
01:13:12,260 --> 01:13:13,700
are going to be those two games.

1524
01:13:14,260 --> 01:13:16,340
It's sad that it's only two games nowadays,

1525
01:13:16,340 --> 01:13:19,220
but Wipeout Omega Collection would be cool.

1526
01:13:19,220 --> 01:13:20,820
I'm not a huge fan of Sniper Elite,

1527
01:13:20,820 --> 01:13:22,340
but I'll take three.

1528
01:13:23,540 --> 01:13:26,340
And then, of course, on the Microsoft side of things,

1529
01:13:26,340 --> 01:13:30,100
we have Gears of War 4 on Xbox One

1530
01:13:30,100 --> 01:13:34,100
and Forza Motorsport 6, two great titles there.

1531
01:13:34,980 --> 01:13:36,020
Gears of War is going to be available

1532
01:13:36,020 --> 01:13:39,220
for the month of August and Forza Motorsport 6

1533
01:13:39,220 --> 01:13:40,660
will be from the middle point

1534
01:13:40,660 --> 01:13:43,460
to the middle point of September.

1535
01:13:43,460 --> 01:13:46,500
And then, of course, your Xbox 360 compatible games.

1536
01:13:46,500 --> 01:13:47,620
You have Torchlight,

1537
01:13:47,620 --> 01:13:49,620
which is going to be the first half of August.

1538
01:13:49,620 --> 01:13:50,980
And then the second half,

1539
01:13:50,980 --> 01:13:53,060
you get Castlevania Lord of Shadow.

1540
01:13:55,460 --> 01:13:56,340
And then, of course,

1541
01:13:56,980 --> 01:13:58,820
since we're talking about free games

1542
01:13:58,820 --> 01:14:00,660
and we're all on Twitch right now,

1543
01:14:01,460 --> 01:14:05,140
Twitch Prime has some free games this month as well.

1544
01:14:05,140 --> 01:14:07,380
So you get a few games,

1545
01:14:07,380 --> 01:14:09,700
including Wonder Boy, Pumped, BMX Pro,

1546
01:14:10,660 --> 01:14:12,020
Mabel and The Wood,

1547
01:14:12,820 --> 01:14:16,020
and then Automachef, or Automachef.

1548
01:14:17,140 --> 01:14:20,100
And that's awesome.

1549
01:14:20,100 --> 01:14:22,020
I keep forgetting to check for games.

1550
01:14:22,020 --> 01:14:28,180
Usually they have the in-game currency

1551
01:14:28,180 --> 01:14:30,420
or skins or something like that

1552
01:14:30,420 --> 01:14:34,180
for a lot of these online games.

1553
01:14:34,180 --> 01:14:38,580
But I remember we used to get more of the free games,

1554
01:14:38,580 --> 01:14:39,620
like indie games and stuff.

1555
01:14:39,620 --> 01:14:41,540
So I don't know if that stopped for a little bit

1556
01:14:41,540 --> 01:14:42,980
and then they started doing it again.

1557
01:14:42,980 --> 01:14:45,780
But I now remember to start looking at that stuff.

1558
01:14:46,740 --> 01:14:48,740
Yeah, Twitch, if you do have Twitch Prime,

1559
01:14:48,740 --> 01:14:50,020
they do have some pretty good deals

1560
01:14:50,020 --> 01:14:53,140
in the giveaway stuff.

1561
01:14:53,140 --> 01:14:54,900
I want to say I still see a few indie games

1562
01:14:54,900 --> 01:14:55,940
in there now and then.

1563
01:14:55,940 --> 01:14:57,540
It doesn't always start off the month either.

1564
01:14:57,540 --> 01:14:59,060
Sometimes it shows up a little later.

1565
01:14:59,060 --> 01:15:00,260
So yeah.

1566
01:15:01,140 --> 01:15:02,180
And then of course,

1567
01:15:02,180 --> 01:15:03,540
I know you didn't go over it yet,

1568
01:15:03,540 --> 01:15:05,860
but if you are using the Epic Games Store,

1569
01:15:05,860 --> 01:15:07,380
I know that store has a lot of controversy

1570
01:15:07,380 --> 01:15:08,260
with it sometimes.

1571
01:15:08,260 --> 01:15:10,020
But if you are using the Epic Games Store,

1572
01:15:10,660 --> 01:15:13,060
there is a lot of stuff to find there too.

1573
01:15:13,620 --> 01:15:16,180
And they're now giving away free games weekly.

1574
01:15:16,180 --> 01:15:17,540
And if I'm not mistaken,

1575
01:15:17,540 --> 01:15:19,540
this week's game is Alan Wake,

1576
01:15:19,540 --> 01:15:21,460
which I think has been given away free before.

1577
01:15:21,460 --> 01:15:22,900
So a lot of you probably have it.

1578
01:15:22,900 --> 01:15:24,580
But if for some reason you've still missed out

1579
01:15:24,580 --> 01:15:26,100
on Alan Wake after all this time,

1580
01:15:26,100 --> 01:15:28,180
speaking of great Xbox 360 titles,

1581
01:15:28,900 --> 01:15:30,420
that is a fantastic one that you should

1582
01:15:30,420 --> 01:15:31,940
be checking out as Alan Wake.

1583
01:15:31,940 --> 01:15:34,500
Yeah, I want to say that I have that

1584
01:15:34,500 --> 01:15:36,340
from one of the Humble Bundles

1585
01:15:36,340 --> 01:15:37,620
that I've purchased.

1586
01:15:37,620 --> 01:15:38,420
But yeah,

1587
01:15:38,420 --> 01:15:40,100
I think most people have probably picked it up

1588
01:15:40,100 --> 01:15:40,900
one way or another right now.

1589
01:15:40,900 --> 01:15:42,260
But that is a great one.

1590
01:15:42,260 --> 01:15:45,460
Yes, Alan Wake and For Honor are free right now.

1591
01:15:45,460 --> 01:15:47,060
Oh yeah, For Honor is up there too.

1592
01:15:47,060 --> 01:15:48,260
So cool.

1593
01:15:48,260 --> 01:15:49,060
I will have those.

1594
01:15:49,060 --> 01:15:50,180
Build up your free game library.

1595
01:15:50,180 --> 01:15:51,140
To my library.

1596
01:15:51,140 --> 01:15:51,860
All right.

1597
01:15:51,860 --> 01:15:53,780
Well, moving on and talking about

1598
01:15:53,780 --> 01:15:57,540
some things going on with the Halo TV series.

1599
01:15:57,540 --> 01:15:59,860
So you remember at Showtime's doing a Halo show?

1600
01:15:59,860 --> 01:16:00,660
Remember that?

1601
01:16:00,660 --> 01:16:02,660
I because I forgot until I heard the news this week.

1602
01:16:02,660 --> 01:16:03,220
I forgot.

1603
01:16:03,220 --> 01:16:03,620
That's right.

1604
01:16:03,620 --> 01:16:05,300
Showtime's doing a Halo show

1605
01:16:05,300 --> 01:16:07,380
and they have announced some casting.

1606
01:16:07,380 --> 01:16:09,540
So Natasha McElhone,

1607
01:16:09,540 --> 01:16:11,140
I hope I'm saying that right.

1608
01:16:11,140 --> 01:16:13,540
She was on the show Ronin and Californication.

1609
01:16:14,260 --> 01:16:16,100
She's going to be playing Cortana.

1610
01:16:16,100 --> 01:16:17,380
She will be the Cortana AI

1611
01:16:17,380 --> 01:16:18,900
in that game's pretty big role, right?

1612
01:16:18,900 --> 01:16:20,340
She had a Windows 10 feature

1613
01:16:20,340 --> 01:16:22,100
that then got scaled back, named after her.

1614
01:16:22,980 --> 01:16:25,220
Also playing Dr. Catherine Helsey,

1615
01:16:25,220 --> 01:16:28,420
who is the creator of Spartan soldiers like Master Chief.

1616
01:16:28,420 --> 01:16:29,780
And I'm pretty sure there's a tie there

1617
01:16:29,780 --> 01:16:31,380
to the Cortana and all that as well.

1618
01:16:33,300 --> 01:16:35,140
There will also be some other folks.

1619
01:16:35,140 --> 01:16:37,060
Bokeem Woodbine from Fargo

1620
01:16:37,060 --> 01:16:39,300
is going to be playing Sorin 066.

1621
01:16:40,100 --> 01:16:40,740
Let's see.

1622
01:16:40,740 --> 01:16:44,660
Shabana Azmi will play the Office of Naval Intelligence head

1623
01:16:44,660 --> 01:16:46,340
Margaret Paranigoski.

1624
01:16:46,340 --> 01:16:47,700
I hope I said that right.

1625
01:16:47,700 --> 01:16:50,180
And yeah, let's see some other Spartans.

1626
01:16:50,180 --> 01:16:52,820
Bentley Kalu from Avengers Age of Ultron

1627
01:16:52,820 --> 01:16:55,060
and Natasha Kolzak from The Witcher.

1628
01:16:55,060 --> 01:16:56,980
Kate Kennedy from Catastrophe.

1629
01:16:56,980 --> 01:16:58,020
So that's pretty cool.

1630
01:16:58,740 --> 01:17:01,700
The series will not start production until later this year,

1631
01:17:01,700 --> 01:17:05,540
and it will be on TV the first quarter of 2021.

1632
01:17:05,540 --> 01:17:07,140
So it's still a little ways out.

1633
01:17:07,140 --> 01:17:08,980
Gee, no wonder I didn't remember it.

1634
01:17:08,980 --> 01:17:09,620
Yeah.

1635
01:17:09,620 --> 01:17:13,060
So anyway, it's always, I think Spielberg's involved,

1636
01:17:13,060 --> 01:17:15,140
if I remember right, was the thing with this.

1637
01:17:15,140 --> 01:17:16,100
So yeah.

1638
01:17:16,100 --> 01:17:16,740
Anyway, there you go.

1639
01:17:16,740 --> 01:17:18,820
Halo TV show and some of the casting.

1640
01:17:18,820 --> 01:17:20,580
And one other story I have for you

1641
01:17:20,580 --> 01:17:21,860
before we go over to Dark Sakura.

1642
01:17:22,500 --> 01:17:24,580
This story has to do with something

1643
01:17:24,580 --> 01:17:26,260
that Riot Games is working on.

1644
01:17:26,260 --> 01:17:28,020
We know that Riot Games, of course,

1645
01:17:28,020 --> 01:17:29,700
is highly tied to League of Legends.

1646
01:17:29,700 --> 01:17:30,740
That's their biggest game.

1647
01:17:31,300 --> 01:17:33,860
But they did confirm at EVO, finally,

1648
01:17:34,980 --> 01:17:36,660
that they are working on a fighting game.

1649
01:17:37,620 --> 01:17:40,260
The fighting game, let's see, Tom Cannon,

1650
01:17:40,260 --> 01:17:43,220
who's the founder of EVO, who works for Riot now,

1651
01:17:43,860 --> 01:17:46,340
called it the worst kept secret in the universe.

1652
01:17:46,340 --> 01:17:47,860
So during EVO's live stream, he said,

1653
01:17:48,820 --> 01:17:52,020
excuse me, back in 2016, we joined forces with Riot

1654
01:17:52,020 --> 01:17:54,180
and I said we were going to go into the hole for a while.

1655
01:17:54,180 --> 01:17:55,460
I want to be able to let people know

1656
01:17:55,460 --> 01:17:57,220
on the worst kept secret in the universe,

1657
01:17:57,220 --> 01:17:58,820
which I can confirm we are working

1658
01:17:58,820 --> 01:18:01,060
on a fighting game for Riot.

1659
01:18:01,060 --> 01:18:03,620
Riot acquired Radiant Entertainment,

1660
01:18:03,620 --> 01:18:06,180
which was the studio that he was a part of.

1661
01:18:06,180 --> 01:18:08,180
So that's where this all comes together.

1662
01:18:09,620 --> 01:18:12,500
They made an online fighting game called Rising Thunder.

1663
01:18:13,140 --> 01:18:15,380
So anyway, no other details about the game,

1664
01:18:15,380 --> 01:18:18,820
just it's coming, wait for it, anticipation,

1665
01:18:18,820 --> 01:18:19,540
all that good stuff.

1666
01:18:20,340 --> 01:18:21,300
Please look forward to it.

1667
01:18:22,180 --> 01:18:22,500
All right.

1668
01:18:23,300 --> 01:18:27,700
Dark Saga, do you have anything for us with rapid fire news?

1669
01:18:27,700 --> 01:18:30,500
Well, there was a leak out about new characters

1670
01:18:30,500 --> 01:18:32,740
coming out for Street Fighter 5.

1671
01:18:32,740 --> 01:18:34,340
And so Calcomes is like, okay, here you go.

1672
01:18:34,340 --> 01:18:35,140
Here's some trailers.

1673
01:18:35,780 --> 01:18:43,460
So we have, looks like Lucia from Final Fight 3.

1674
01:18:44,180 --> 01:18:49,380
We have E. Honda from, you know, classic Street Fighter.

1675
01:18:49,380 --> 01:18:57,540
And we have Poison from Final Fight, sorry.

1676
01:18:57,540 --> 01:18:59,380
So pretty cool group.

1677
01:19:00,500 --> 01:19:01,940
I'd say they're going to be fun to use.

1678
01:19:04,660 --> 01:19:06,020
And I'm sure a lot of people were like,

1679
01:19:06,020 --> 01:19:07,620
we want Honda for real.

1680
01:19:07,620 --> 01:19:10,340
And his, I actually saw like what all of his outfits are.

1681
01:19:10,340 --> 01:19:12,660
He has kind of like this pimp looking outfit

1682
01:19:12,660 --> 01:19:15,140
for his business outfit is actually kind of fun.

1683
01:19:16,020 --> 01:19:18,980
Back in the day, back in Street Fighter 2, like in the day,

1684
01:19:18,980 --> 01:19:19,700
like, what was that?

1685
01:19:19,700 --> 01:19:21,380
Probably like early high school, junior high school

1686
01:19:21,380 --> 01:19:22,500
when I was playing Street Fighter 2.

1687
01:19:22,500 --> 01:19:23,620
I used to love E. Honda.

1688
01:19:23,620 --> 01:19:25,620
Like I just love that character because I would,

1689
01:19:25,620 --> 01:19:27,060
it was all about the a hundred hand slap.

1690
01:19:27,060 --> 01:19:28,420
You just hit that punch button real fast

1691
01:19:28,420 --> 01:19:29,860
and it was very, very annoying.

1692
01:19:29,860 --> 01:19:31,940
And then of course Chun Li had her version of that,

1693
01:19:31,940 --> 01:19:33,460
but for some reason his was better.

1694
01:19:33,460 --> 01:19:35,140
Oh, because in the later Street Fighter games,

1695
01:19:35,140 --> 01:19:36,980
you can move back and forth while you were doing it.

1696
01:19:36,980 --> 01:19:38,420
In like Super Street Fighter and stuff.

1697
01:19:38,420 --> 01:19:39,140
So, yeah.

1698
01:19:40,100 --> 01:19:46,020
And then also the probably worst character ever

1699
01:19:46,020 --> 01:19:48,980
in a Dragon Ball movie, Janenba is going to be

1700
01:19:48,980 --> 01:19:52,100
in Dragon Ball FighterZ and Gogeta

1701
01:19:52,100 --> 01:19:53,700
is going to be in there too.

1702
01:19:53,700 --> 01:19:57,380
So that fucking movie was terrible,

1703
01:19:58,180 --> 01:20:00,580
but it has like one of my favorite lines in there

1704
01:20:00,580 --> 01:20:04,020
because it's okay.

1705
01:20:04,020 --> 01:20:06,180
In the movie, Goku and Vegeta are dead.

1706
01:20:06,180 --> 01:20:09,300
So they're in hell fighting this evil hell beast

1707
01:20:10,100 --> 01:20:12,740
and Goku spends like half the movie.

1708
01:20:12,740 --> 01:20:13,460
We need to fuse.

1709
01:20:13,460 --> 01:20:14,500
We need to fuse to beat it.

1710
01:20:14,500 --> 01:20:16,660
And Vegeta is like, I'd rather die than fuse.

1711
01:20:16,660 --> 01:20:18,820
He's like, but Vegeta, we're already dead.

1712
01:20:19,540 --> 01:20:20,980
So it has like my favorite line,

1713
01:20:20,980 --> 01:20:22,100
but it's a really bad movie.

1714
01:20:23,380 --> 01:20:24,020
Okay.

1715
01:20:24,020 --> 01:20:24,520
All right.

1716
01:20:26,420 --> 01:20:28,340
So let's travel around the world

1717
01:20:28,340 --> 01:20:29,860
and check out some release dates

1718
01:20:29,860 --> 01:20:32,180
and see what's coming out in this gaming store near you.

1719
01:20:32,180 --> 01:20:32,680
Loki.

1720
01:20:33,220 --> 01:20:34,180
Not a lot of stuff.

1721
01:20:34,180 --> 01:20:36,980
We've got Age of Wonders, Planet Fall on PC,

1722
01:20:36,980 --> 01:20:38,980
PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

1723
01:20:39,780 --> 01:20:42,820
Illusion of La Fosia.

1724
01:20:42,820 --> 01:20:45,300
And that's coming out on PlayStation 4.

1725
01:20:46,420 --> 01:20:52,020
Metal Wolf Chaos XD on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

1726
01:20:53,540 --> 01:20:56,340
We've got Pillars of Eternity Complete Edition

1727
01:20:56,340 --> 01:20:57,300
on Nintendo Switch.

1728
01:20:57,940 --> 01:21:01,140
Sword Art Online Fatal Bullet Complete Edition

1729
01:21:01,140 --> 01:21:02,180
on Nintendo Switch.

1730
01:21:04,420 --> 01:21:06,420
And that's it.

1731
01:21:08,660 --> 01:21:09,940
Sorry, we got distracted here.

1732
01:21:09,940 --> 01:21:10,660
The cat made it.

1733
01:21:10,660 --> 01:21:11,700
Did he knock over the bottle?

1734
01:21:11,700 --> 01:21:12,180
What was it?

1735
01:21:12,180 --> 01:21:12,740
Was that you?

1736
01:21:14,580 --> 01:21:16,260
Oh, did it wake him up or something?

1737
01:21:16,260 --> 01:21:17,140
It disturbed him.

1738
01:21:17,940 --> 01:21:18,660
Oh, okay.

1739
01:21:18,660 --> 01:21:19,060
Weird.

1740
01:21:19,060 --> 01:21:19,300
All right.

1741
01:21:19,300 --> 01:21:20,340
Well, as long as he's okay.

1742
01:21:20,340 --> 01:21:20,660
All right.

1743
01:21:20,660 --> 01:21:21,380
Sorry.

1744
01:21:21,380 --> 01:21:22,100
Just it.

1745
01:21:22,100 --> 01:21:23,620
Mr. Smoosh is very important.

1746
01:21:24,660 --> 01:21:26,500
He will be protected at all costs.

1747
01:21:27,220 --> 01:21:28,100
So, all right.

1748
01:21:28,100 --> 01:21:30,180
Anyway, sorry about that.

1749
01:21:30,180 --> 01:21:33,380
So let's go over to Japan and check out releases there in Japan.

1750
01:21:34,020 --> 01:21:35,140
Coming out in Japan this week,

1751
01:21:35,140 --> 01:21:36,740
we have quite a few things on PlayStation 4,

1752
01:21:36,740 --> 01:21:38,900
but many of them are games you've already had here.

1753
01:21:38,900 --> 01:21:40,580
They're just coming out in Japan for the first time.

1754
01:21:41,380 --> 01:21:43,140
Or a re-pricing.

1755
01:21:43,140 --> 01:21:45,620
Fatal 12 is a new game though that's out in Japan.

1756
01:21:45,620 --> 01:21:47,380
So that is coming out this week.

1757
01:21:48,100 --> 01:21:51,140
I believe that also has like an English language option in it.

1758
01:21:51,140 --> 01:21:52,900
So some folks may choose to import that.

1759
01:21:52,900 --> 01:21:53,300
I don't know.

1760
01:21:53,940 --> 01:21:55,060
Also on Japan this week,

1761
01:21:55,060 --> 01:21:58,100
Wolfenstein Youngblood and Wolfenstein Cyberpilot.

1762
01:21:58,100 --> 01:22:00,180
Also Friday the 13th of the game,

1763
01:22:00,180 --> 01:22:02,740
moving into the hits collection for PlayStation 4.

1764
01:22:02,820 --> 01:22:04,020
And let's see.

1765
01:22:04,980 --> 01:22:06,820
Nioh also gets out.

1766
01:22:06,820 --> 01:22:07,780
N-I-O-H.

1767
01:22:07,780 --> 01:22:10,580
Nioh comes out for PlayStation hits.

1768
01:22:10,580 --> 01:22:11,700
I think that's already been out,

1769
01:22:11,700 --> 01:22:13,140
but it's getting a price reduction.

1770
01:22:13,780 --> 01:22:16,420
Going over to the Switch and seeing what we have over there.

1771
01:22:17,220 --> 01:22:19,460
Puyo Puyo Tetris gets a price reduction

1772
01:22:19,460 --> 01:22:21,380
and a special price addition there.

1773
01:22:21,380 --> 01:22:24,020
And Sword Art Online Fatal Bullet.

1774
01:22:24,020 --> 01:22:25,540
That'll be a catch some eyes.

1775
01:22:25,540 --> 01:22:26,500
That is out as well.

1776
01:22:26,500 --> 01:22:28,900
And then Shining Resonance Refrain

1777
01:22:28,900 --> 01:22:31,620
getting a new price addition there on the Switch as well.

1778
01:22:31,620 --> 01:22:33,940
So some rereleases and some familiar things,

1779
01:22:33,940 --> 01:22:35,940
but a couple of new games in there as well.

1780
01:22:35,940 --> 01:22:37,140
Dark Sakura, how about the UK?

1781
01:22:37,140 --> 01:22:41,060
I've only got three things for UK in the upcoming week.

1782
01:22:41,060 --> 01:22:43,380
On the 5th, we have Age of Wonders Planetfall.

1783
01:22:44,420 --> 01:22:48,340
That's going to be on PlayStation, Xbox, PC.

1784
01:22:49,700 --> 01:22:52,100
For Switch, we have on the 8th,

1785
01:22:52,100 --> 01:22:55,780
Ugly Dolls and Imperfect Adventure and Ultra Wings.

1786
01:22:56,820 --> 01:22:59,380
Also, Ugly Dolls will be on PlayStation and Xbox.

1787
01:23:00,180 --> 01:23:00,900
That's it.

1788
01:23:00,900 --> 01:23:01,780
All right.

1789
01:23:01,780 --> 01:23:03,940
Well, now we're going to get to the mailbag.

1790
01:23:03,940 --> 01:23:04,820
Sorry, Dark Sakura.

1791
01:23:04,820 --> 01:23:06,740
I know you getting ready to eat dinner there,

1792
01:23:06,740 --> 01:23:08,180
but that's OK.

1793
01:23:08,980 --> 01:23:10,900
Once we get past this, you'll have plenty of time to eat.

1794
01:23:10,900 --> 01:23:12,420
So we're going to get to our mailbag statement.

1795
01:23:12,420 --> 01:23:14,500
Every week, we invite you guys to send us emails

1796
01:23:14,500 --> 01:23:17,780
to participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

1797
01:23:17,780 --> 01:23:18,180
It's fine.

1798
01:23:18,180 --> 01:23:20,740
And we pick a few of our favorite emails to read here on the show.

1799
01:23:21,300 --> 01:23:23,860
Hopefully nobody in our inbox trying to tell us

1800
01:23:23,860 --> 01:23:25,780
that they caught us wasterbaiting this week

1801
01:23:25,780 --> 01:23:27,460
like we had last week.

1802
01:23:28,260 --> 01:23:28,900
Dark Sakura.

1803
01:23:28,900 --> 01:23:30,500
I deleted that and bypassed the trash.

1804
01:23:30,980 --> 01:23:31,460
OK, good.

1805
01:23:33,780 --> 01:23:34,260
Hi, all.

1806
01:23:34,260 --> 01:23:35,780
It's Metal Mayhem or Raginator,

1807
01:23:35,780 --> 01:23:37,300
whatever name you want to refer to me by.

1808
01:23:37,300 --> 01:23:39,140
I don't really personally care to be H.

1809
01:23:39,140 --> 01:23:40,980
Oh, whatever name, huh?

1810
01:23:40,980 --> 01:23:41,300
Let's see.

1811
01:23:41,300 --> 01:23:42,820
I'm going to call you Wastinator.

1812
01:23:42,820 --> 01:23:44,100
OK, Wastinator, yes.

1813
01:23:48,020 --> 01:23:49,140
Wastinator.

1814
01:23:49,140 --> 01:23:53,220
I thought I'd try writing in since it may be difficult at best for me to call in.

1815
01:23:53,220 --> 01:23:58,340
My PC headsets mic has bit the dust and doing a call via Discord on my phone

1816
01:23:58,340 --> 01:24:03,540
will be a bigger pain in the ass than a visit to the proctologist that doesn't use lube.

1817
01:24:05,300 --> 01:24:06,900
I didn't need that imagery.

1818
01:24:07,620 --> 01:24:10,100
This week I thought I'd write in regarding PC gaming.

1819
01:24:10,100 --> 01:24:13,700
For brevity reasons, I won't recount why I got into PC gaming in my email.

1820
01:24:13,700 --> 01:24:15,380
That's been covered to death in the past.

1821
01:24:15,940 --> 01:24:16,340
Thank you.

1822
01:24:16,900 --> 01:24:23,140
Nonetheless, I'll mention that my first PC game

1823
01:24:24,100 --> 01:24:29,060
was Diablo II war chest version with base game expansion manual and guide

1824
01:24:29,060 --> 01:24:31,060
and that I got it at Target for 20 bucks.

1825
01:24:31,940 --> 01:24:35,540
I got the game seeing as I had played Diablo on PS1

1826
01:24:36,340 --> 01:24:38,900
and loved that game so I figured Diablo II would be good too.

1827
01:24:39,700 --> 01:24:43,540
A few months later I joined Steam because Rob always used to mention

1828
01:24:43,540 --> 01:24:45,780
them and their sales being akin to crack.

1829
01:24:45,780 --> 01:24:46,740
My words, not his.

1830
01:24:47,860 --> 01:24:51,860
Looking back, at this point I prefer PC gaming over console gaming

1831
01:24:51,860 --> 01:24:54,500
due to the deals in one form or another.

1832
01:24:54,500 --> 01:24:57,860
I managed to build a massive game library over the seven years,

1833
01:24:57,860 --> 01:24:59,060
about 2000 games or so.

1834
01:24:59,060 --> 01:25:01,220
That sounds like my normal games collection.

1835
01:25:01,220 --> 01:25:02,660
Yeah, wow, it's so impressive.

1836
01:25:02,660 --> 01:25:05,780
I never had that many games on consoles.

1837
01:25:05,780 --> 01:25:09,060
All that being said, I'd like to pose these questions.

1838
01:25:09,060 --> 01:25:11,540
For those of you that are PC gamers,

1839
01:25:11,540 --> 01:25:14,660
what was your first PC game and why did you pick that as your first game?

1840
01:25:14,660 --> 01:25:16,900
Additionally, what drew you to PC gaming to begin with?

1841
01:25:17,540 --> 01:25:21,140
Fun fact, this email was completed and released before Loki completed and released Time to Car.

1842
01:25:22,260 --> 01:25:24,980
What was your first PC game?

1843
01:25:24,980 --> 01:25:25,780
I don't know if I can remember.

1844
01:25:25,780 --> 01:25:29,940
My first PC was a 386 SX16 and it didn't run much.

1845
01:25:29,940 --> 01:25:30,900
Commodore 64?

1846
01:25:32,260 --> 01:25:35,620
Oh yeah, I guess Commodore 64 was a personal computer,

1847
01:25:35,620 --> 01:25:37,460
if you want to say it in the purest sense.

1848
01:25:37,460 --> 01:25:40,660
The first game I remember playing on the Commodore 64

1849
01:25:40,660 --> 01:25:43,700
would have been one of two games that my memory pulls up.

1850
01:25:43,700 --> 01:25:47,940
A game called Le Mans, like a racing game,

1851
01:25:47,940 --> 01:25:50,100
and you would actually use the paddle as a cartridge

1852
01:25:50,980 --> 01:25:52,580
that you would plug in the device.

1853
01:25:52,580 --> 01:25:57,460
And it was like a pole position type of thing, but overhead.

1854
01:25:57,460 --> 01:25:59,460
So the graphics weren't quite as complicated,

1855
01:25:59,460 --> 01:26:02,340
but I do remember playing that and that was a really fun racing game,

1856
01:26:02,340 --> 01:26:04,500
you know, when you're like seven years old.

1857
01:26:05,060 --> 01:26:05,860
So I remember that.

1858
01:26:06,820 --> 01:26:12,260
And then I also remember Slinky was one of the first PC games I had.

1859
01:26:12,260 --> 01:26:15,540
And that game was scary because the music was scary

1860
01:26:15,540 --> 01:26:18,900
and the big enemies that would come out were scary looking.

1861
01:26:18,900 --> 01:26:21,300
But Slinky was basically a Qbert ripoff.

1862
01:26:21,300 --> 01:26:23,220
It was completely a Qbert ripoff,

1863
01:26:23,220 --> 01:26:24,740
but the board looked a little different

1864
01:26:24,740 --> 01:26:27,220
and some of the monsters were very, very different.

1865
01:26:27,220 --> 01:26:28,660
So like, it was creepy.

1866
01:26:28,660 --> 01:26:30,500
Like when you die, all the monsters would come out

1867
01:26:30,500 --> 01:26:31,940
and then like attack your corpse

1868
01:26:31,940 --> 01:26:34,260
and a little flower would fall down like you were dead.

1869
01:26:34,260 --> 01:26:35,860
Like it was, that's the part that was scary.

1870
01:26:36,420 --> 01:26:39,860
So yeah, I guess if we went all the way back to Commodore 64,

1871
01:26:39,860 --> 01:26:40,820
it'd be that.

1872
01:26:40,820 --> 01:26:41,780
Pure PC?

1873
01:26:43,220 --> 01:26:43,780
I don't know.

1874
01:26:43,780 --> 01:26:46,020
I don't remember what the first games we had were.

1875
01:26:46,020 --> 01:26:47,780
It had to have been a Sierra game.

1876
01:26:47,780 --> 01:26:50,100
It had to be something like King's Quest 4

1877
01:26:50,900 --> 01:26:53,940
or something that would run off the disks.

1878
01:26:56,020 --> 01:26:56,740
I'm trying to remember.

1879
01:26:56,740 --> 01:26:57,860
I haven't, I'm drawing a blank.

1880
01:26:57,860 --> 01:26:59,140
Maybe Jones and the Fastlane.

1881
01:27:00,260 --> 01:27:01,620
No, I feel like that game came out later.

1882
01:27:01,620 --> 01:27:03,380
I feel like that was a 486 game.

1883
01:27:03,380 --> 01:27:06,180
I remember playing on the PS, my friend,

1884
01:27:06,180 --> 01:27:09,460
my friend had a PS2, not a PlayStation 2,

1885
01:27:09,460 --> 01:27:13,140
but the IBM PS2, because I remember everything was PS2.

1886
01:27:13,140 --> 01:27:16,420
In fact, they still sell PS2 compatible keyboards.

1887
01:27:16,420 --> 01:27:18,100
That's what, you know, the design was for.

1888
01:27:19,060 --> 01:27:22,260
I remember playing an X-Men game that was really fun.

1889
01:27:22,260 --> 01:27:24,740
You had that, you were basically trying to save Storm.

1890
01:27:24,740 --> 01:27:27,620
She'd been kidnapped and you were playing the other X-Men.

1891
01:27:27,620 --> 01:27:30,500
Well, the whole, the reason why they couldn't have

1892
01:27:30,500 --> 01:27:32,820
Storm be a character because she's too powerful.

1893
01:27:33,860 --> 01:27:36,740
So they had to have a story where she gets kidnapped

1894
01:27:36,740 --> 01:27:38,420
so they didn't have to make her a character.

1895
01:27:39,700 --> 01:27:41,620
But you play it like a lot of the other X-Men.

1896
01:27:41,620 --> 01:27:43,060
I remember that game being a lot of fun.

1897
01:27:43,620 --> 01:27:46,340
So anyway, those are the best answers I have.

1898
01:27:46,580 --> 01:27:47,860
TI 99 4A.

1899
01:27:49,380 --> 01:27:51,380
It was, I had to look up the name again,

1900
01:27:51,380 --> 01:27:52,740
cause I know it wasn't Space Invaders.

1901
01:27:52,740 --> 01:27:55,380
It was TI Invaders and there was Munch Man.

1902
01:27:56,420 --> 01:28:00,020
You guys also Parsec and Car Wars.

1903
01:28:00,020 --> 01:28:01,140
Car Wars was a big one.

1904
01:28:02,820 --> 01:28:05,460
I don't really remember anything on the Coleco Adam

1905
01:28:05,460 --> 01:28:08,020
because all the cassettes would get erased

1906
01:28:08,020 --> 01:28:09,540
in a power surge.

1907
01:28:09,540 --> 01:28:10,580
So that was stupid.

1908
01:28:11,380 --> 01:28:14,420
And then I'll be honest, I had used like all Macs at school

1909
01:28:14,420 --> 01:28:15,380
and everything.

1910
01:28:15,380 --> 01:28:20,340
So I'd say probably my first PC era game

1911
01:28:21,140 --> 01:28:24,420
other than Gemstone, which was a tech space game,

1912
01:28:25,300 --> 01:28:27,940
was probably the occasional different MUD

1913
01:28:27,940 --> 01:28:32,740
or the Rogue clones and Doom.

1914
01:28:34,980 --> 01:28:36,020
Doom's a good pick.

1915
01:28:36,020 --> 01:28:37,300
That's a classic, classic PC game.

1916
01:28:37,300 --> 01:28:37,800
And Loom.

1917
01:28:38,820 --> 01:28:39,540
Oh yeah.

1918
01:28:39,540 --> 01:28:40,500
You know, I love Loom.

1919
01:28:40,500 --> 01:28:41,000
Oh yeah.

1920
01:28:41,880 --> 01:28:45,800
I remember I had a game and I think it was LucasArts.

1921
01:28:45,800 --> 01:28:47,240
Legend of Chirandia.

1922
01:28:47,240 --> 01:28:49,640
You know, you've brought this game on the show, Loki.

1923
01:28:49,640 --> 01:28:52,200
It's on Westwood Studios.

1924
01:28:52,200 --> 01:28:52,760
That's right.

1925
01:28:52,760 --> 01:28:55,560
It was like another studio that tried to kind of get in there.

1926
01:28:55,560 --> 01:28:56,040
That's right.

1927
01:28:56,040 --> 01:28:57,000
You're right.

1928
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:58,360
So yeah, I remember that game.

1929
01:28:58,360 --> 01:28:58,600
Yeah.

1930
01:28:58,600 --> 01:28:59,800
EA killed them.

1931
01:28:59,800 --> 01:29:00,600
Oh, that's too bad.

1932
01:29:00,600 --> 01:29:01,400
Westwood.

1933
01:29:01,400 --> 01:29:03,720
They also did the Command and Conquer.

1934
01:29:03,720 --> 01:29:04,600
Oh, right.

1935
01:29:04,600 --> 01:29:04,920
Right.

1936
01:29:04,920 --> 01:29:05,240
Okay.

1937
01:29:05,880 --> 01:29:06,600
Loki, what about you?

1938
01:29:06,600 --> 01:29:08,280
Earliest PC gaming memories.

1939
01:29:08,280 --> 01:29:10,120
Also TI 99 4A.

1940
01:29:10,360 --> 01:29:14,040
I also had Munch Man, but one I remember playing the most was Alpiner.

1941
01:29:17,080 --> 01:29:18,680
I'm sure there's other games I had as well,

1942
01:29:18,680 --> 01:29:21,320
but those are the only ones I remember off hand.

1943
01:29:22,840 --> 01:29:23,800
Good question.

1944
01:29:23,800 --> 01:29:29,800
My first actual PC, aside from the TI 99, was an IBM.

1945
01:29:29,800 --> 01:29:30,280
I don't remember.

1946
01:29:30,280 --> 01:29:36,920
It was a 286 PC and I had SimCity and I played it on a monochrome monitor.

1947
01:29:36,920 --> 01:29:38,120
Oh, good pick.

1948
01:29:38,840 --> 01:29:39,400
Yeah.

1949
01:29:39,400 --> 01:29:39,800
Love it.

1950
01:29:40,600 --> 01:29:41,320
Good picks.

1951
01:29:41,320 --> 01:29:43,960
I did have Where in Time is Carmen Sandiego.

1952
01:29:43,960 --> 01:29:45,640
I played a lot more of that in the world.

1953
01:29:45,640 --> 01:29:49,800
Somebody in chat said the Where in Blank is Carmen Sandiego was their first game.

1954
01:29:49,800 --> 01:29:51,160
So very good.

1955
01:29:51,160 --> 01:29:51,960
Good picks all around.

1956
01:29:51,960 --> 01:29:52,440
Good question.

1957
01:29:52,440 --> 01:29:53,880
That was a fun trip down memory lane.

1958
01:29:53,880 --> 01:29:54,360
So there you go.

1959
01:29:54,920 --> 01:29:56,520
Any other emails or was that it?

1960
01:29:56,520 --> 01:29:57,240
All right, that's it.

1961
01:29:57,240 --> 01:30:02,520
So participate at orangeloungeradio.com if you want to send us an email in a future week.

1962
01:30:02,520 --> 01:30:05,720
Meanwhile, we have some more stories for you guys before we get to Discord tonight.

1963
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:08,680
Oh, I apologize.

1964
01:30:08,680 --> 01:30:09,880
We do have one more.

1965
01:30:10,520 --> 01:30:11,400
Last minute email.

1966
01:30:11,400 --> 01:30:11,720
All right.

1967
01:30:12,360 --> 01:30:15,640
Rob, when you say you're sorting your Pokemon and Pokemon go by star rating,

1968
01:30:15,640 --> 01:30:18,360
are you seeing all your zero star Pokemon at once?

1969
01:30:18,360 --> 01:30:19,080
How do you do that?

1970
01:30:19,080 --> 01:30:20,440
I'm not seeing such an option.

1971
01:30:20,440 --> 01:30:21,480
This comes from Robert M.

1972
01:30:21,480 --> 01:30:22,520
Oh, good question.

1973
01:30:22,520 --> 01:30:28,680
So all you do is when you go into Pokemon first, number one is more important.

1974
01:30:28,680 --> 01:30:32,040
Make sure you have latest version because if you're still running an old version,

1975
01:30:32,040 --> 01:30:34,200
you're not going to be able to do that.

1976
01:30:34,200 --> 01:30:37,560
But then what you do is you go into in the game.

1977
01:30:37,560 --> 01:30:44,840
You're going to actually go into your Pokemon, which you can do with the little with the Pokeball.

1978
01:30:44,840 --> 01:30:48,120
You touch that and you do Pokemon, and that's going to bring up all the Pokemon that you have.

1979
01:30:48,120 --> 01:30:49,000
They can't see on the camera.

1980
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:49,960
They can't see it on the camera.

1981
01:30:49,960 --> 01:30:50,200
All right.

1982
01:30:50,200 --> 01:30:50,700
I tried.

1983
01:30:51,480 --> 01:30:57,160
But then you tap the magnifying glass at the top of the screen and you type zero and it's an asterisk.

1984
01:30:57,160 --> 01:30:59,880
So when I say star, I mean the asterisk.

1985
01:30:59,880 --> 01:31:03,080
And that's going to bring up all of your zero star Pokemon,

1986
01:31:03,080 --> 01:31:06,760
which sadly two of the shinies I caught yesterday are zero stars.

1987
01:31:06,760 --> 01:31:08,920
So use the asterisk and that's it.

1988
01:31:08,920 --> 01:31:10,280
That's the only two characters you need.

1989
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:16,040
Four star will show you all of your Pokemon that are 100%, which is pretty cool to see.

1990
01:31:16,040 --> 01:31:19,080
I now have two centrets that are 100%.

1991
01:31:19,080 --> 01:31:21,240
I wish I had a better Pokemon at 100%, but whatever.

1992
01:31:22,920 --> 01:31:30,440
And you can also use three star for the wonder Pokemon or that's what they're called.

1993
01:31:30,440 --> 01:31:34,200
If you're on the blue team, I forget what the red team and the yellow team say it on those appraisals.

1994
01:31:34,200 --> 01:31:35,000
So that's it.

1995
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:37,320
Just the two characters, zero and the asterisk,

1996
01:31:37,320 --> 01:31:40,040
and use the magnifying glass at the top in order to be able to do that.

1997
01:31:41,560 --> 01:31:42,200
Happy to help.

1998
01:31:43,320 --> 01:31:45,480
Now that is all of our emails tonight.

1999
01:31:45,480 --> 01:31:50,840
So participate at orangelaundry.com if you want to send us an email in a future week.

2000
01:31:50,840 --> 01:31:53,880
In the meantime, something you want to add?

2001
01:31:53,880 --> 01:31:55,880
No, just my dinner was ambitious.

2002
01:31:55,880 --> 01:31:56,680
Oh yeah.

2003
01:31:56,680 --> 01:31:59,240
It looks, it looks, you're welcome to some.

2004
01:31:59,240 --> 01:32:01,960
Well, it smells like Chinese in here now, but it's a good smell.

2005
01:32:02,440 --> 01:32:04,920
Lemon chicken and chicken chow mein.

2006
01:32:04,920 --> 01:32:09,000
Which I don't say it on air, but I'm curious which place you got that from.

2007
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:10,600
So China something.

2008
01:32:10,600 --> 01:32:11,000
Okay.

2009
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:11,320
All right.

2010
01:32:11,320 --> 01:32:12,120
I believe you.

2011
01:32:12,120 --> 01:32:13,000
Anyway, let's move on.

2012
01:32:13,560 --> 01:32:15,400
Loki, let's get into some other news here.

2013
01:32:15,400 --> 01:32:19,000
Let's talk about things that, um, never happened.

2014
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:23,400
And that is that fancy graphics update for Minecraft.

2015
01:32:23,400 --> 01:32:27,800
That was supposed to give us the 4k visuals and the improved lighting and all that stuff.

2016
01:32:28,760 --> 01:32:33,240
Promised to us back in 2017 during E3.

2017
01:32:33,240 --> 01:32:36,120
And unfortunately we haven't heard anything about it.

2018
01:32:36,760 --> 01:32:40,040
The reason may be because there's not a lot of people working on it.

2019
01:32:40,040 --> 01:32:45,080
Apparently only about eight people on the team are actually working on this project.

2020
01:32:45,080 --> 01:32:49,480
And apparently it was harder than they originally thought because they have to actually

2021
01:32:49,480 --> 01:32:54,040
rewrite or overhaul many portions of the engine to get it to actually work.

2022
01:32:54,920 --> 01:33:00,520
So the super duper graphics pack, not going to be out anytime soon, unfortunately.

2023
01:33:02,360 --> 01:33:02,860
Rude.

2024
01:33:03,320 --> 01:33:03,820
Mean.

2025
01:33:05,160 --> 01:33:06,920
I want my 4k Minecraft.

2026
01:33:06,920 --> 01:33:07,320
Damn it.

2027
01:33:07,320 --> 01:33:11,000
Well, in the meantime, PC and Sonic ether's unbelievable shaders.

2028
01:33:12,120 --> 01:33:12,760
I guess.

2029
01:33:12,760 --> 01:33:14,280
Leave it to the mod community.

2030
01:33:14,280 --> 01:33:18,120
Speaking of the mic community, let's I'm a totally tangent this into something else.

2031
01:33:18,120 --> 01:33:21,400
So something I've noticed Alan has been playing a ton of this week.

2032
01:33:21,400 --> 01:33:22,520
Black Mesa.

2033
01:33:22,520 --> 01:33:27,400
Because apparently, so, you know, Black Mesa is like, they redid Half-Life, right?

2034
01:33:27,400 --> 01:33:30,520
So, um, but they've been working on the ending sequence.

2035
01:33:30,520 --> 01:33:32,920
The Zen, I think it's called is that last sequence.

2036
01:33:32,920 --> 01:33:38,760
So they just put out the first part of the Zen levels like this last week.

2037
01:33:38,760 --> 01:33:42,360
So he's been playing a lot of that, just kind of revisiting Black Mesa because that's

2038
01:33:42,360 --> 01:33:44,920
Half-Life is like one of Alan's like all time favorite games.

2039
01:33:44,920 --> 01:33:46,520
So I know he revisits it once a year.

2040
01:33:46,520 --> 01:33:48,920
So this is like his good opportunity to do that.

2041
01:33:48,920 --> 01:33:54,600
So, but funny enough, the other game that Alan has been playing a lot lately is No Man's Sky.

2042
01:33:54,600 --> 01:33:57,160
And there's some new news on No Man's Sky this week.

2043
01:33:57,160 --> 01:34:00,520
We talked a little bit about this last week, but now we have a date.

2044
01:34:00,520 --> 01:34:03,560
No Man's Sky VR, which is the Beyond version.

2045
01:34:03,560 --> 01:34:08,040
So No Man's Sky Beyond will be out on August 14th.

2046
01:34:08,040 --> 01:34:11,240
So there's some updates, including PSVR.

2047
01:34:11,240 --> 01:34:12,120
That'll be very cool.

2048
01:34:12,760 --> 01:34:14,600
I'm excited to try that on PlayStation.

2049
01:34:14,600 --> 01:34:15,880
That's where I have the game.

2050
01:34:15,880 --> 01:34:17,000
Alan plays on PC.

2051
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:18,040
I play on PlayStation.

2052
01:34:18,040 --> 01:34:22,760
So sadly we're not in the same universe, but Beyond is also going to expand social

2053
01:34:22,760 --> 01:34:24,440
and multiplayer options.

2054
01:34:24,440 --> 01:34:28,680
So they're going to make it a little more like, you don't want to call it an MMO, but

2055
01:34:28,680 --> 01:34:32,360
some of those things I think we all imagined in the beginning are going to be a little

2056
01:34:32,360 --> 01:34:33,560
more there.

2057
01:34:33,560 --> 01:34:34,840
And this update is free.

2058
01:34:34,840 --> 01:34:38,440
It's not going to be something like a micro transaction, like you might see in an MMO.

2059
01:34:38,440 --> 01:34:39,640
So very exciting.

2060
01:34:41,240 --> 01:34:44,840
You're going to actually be able to meet and play with other people if you want.

2061
01:34:44,840 --> 01:34:47,480
I don't know if I want to play with other people, but there you go.

2062
01:34:48,520 --> 01:34:48,920
All right.

2063
01:34:48,920 --> 01:34:49,560
Dark Sakura.

2064
01:34:51,640 --> 01:34:52,040
Whale.

2065
01:34:53,240 --> 01:34:54,520
How dare you when I'm digesting.

2066
01:34:55,400 --> 01:34:57,320
Anyway, Pokemon Go.

2067
01:34:58,120 --> 01:34:59,880
We haven't forgotten that it exists, right?

2068
01:34:59,880 --> 01:35:04,680
Especially since you just got asked a question about sorting your Pokemanses.

2069
01:35:06,440 --> 01:35:13,320
Well, the game actually hit a billion downloads in just three years after it was released.

2070
01:35:14,280 --> 01:35:20,760
Pokemon Company actually released some videos commemorating the big marker.

2071
01:35:21,400 --> 01:35:28,280
And of course, some of those billion downloads include redownload, but it's still a pretty

2072
01:35:28,280 --> 01:35:32,120
good number, especially since they're like, oh, that won't make it past a year.

2073
01:35:33,560 --> 01:35:34,040
Look, bitch.

2074
01:35:34,920 --> 01:35:41,160
Anyway, of course, the numbers have slowed down because it's a mobile game, and we've

2075
01:35:41,160 --> 01:35:44,040
just had Harry Potter Wizards Untie come out.

2076
01:35:44,040 --> 01:35:44,360
Sorry.

2077
01:35:44,360 --> 01:35:44,860
Unite.

2078
01:35:46,360 --> 01:35:47,640
Wizards Untie.

2079
01:35:47,640 --> 01:35:48,040
Love it.

2080
01:35:48,040 --> 01:35:48,360
Okay.

2081
01:35:48,360 --> 01:35:49,000
My brain.

2082
01:35:50,440 --> 01:35:51,240
No, it's fine.

2083
01:35:51,240 --> 01:35:51,720
It's funny.

2084
01:35:52,840 --> 01:35:53,400
Yeah.

2085
01:35:53,400 --> 01:35:55,240
I just keep thinking Untie.

2086
01:35:56,760 --> 01:35:59,080
It's one of the spells you cast.

2087
01:35:59,080 --> 01:35:59,800
Alohomora.

2088
01:36:00,360 --> 01:36:01,000
That's unlocked.

2089
01:36:02,920 --> 01:36:11,000
But anyway, it still gets about 147 million users per month.

2090
01:36:11,880 --> 01:36:16,200
Um, and that was as of May this year.

2091
01:36:16,200 --> 01:36:20,520
Hey, when I, you know, I just drove around the capital and I was floored by how many

2092
01:36:20,520 --> 01:36:23,080
people I saw playing out there in the 100 degree heat.

2093
01:36:23,080 --> 01:36:26,920
So there's still, I mean, Ralts is probably one of the most desirable Pokemon.

2094
01:36:26,920 --> 01:36:29,080
A lot of people were waiting for this community today.

2095
01:36:29,080 --> 01:36:32,920
Um, but, uh, yeah, I was, I was still shocked at how many people I saw out there.

2096
01:36:32,920 --> 01:36:35,880
My buddy right now is a Ralts so I can get the special evolution.

2097
01:36:36,680 --> 01:36:38,360
So nice.

2098
01:36:38,440 --> 01:36:44,440
Or whatever the one up from Ralts is, uh, the, the one that's Gardevoir, but,

2099
01:36:44,440 --> 01:36:46,440
uh, but there's a male one Galliate or something.

2100
01:36:46,440 --> 01:36:47,640
That's the one I'm trying to get.

2101
01:36:47,640 --> 01:36:48,200
Yeah.

2102
01:36:48,200 --> 01:36:53,800
So I'm working on my Ralts right now so that I can use.

2103
01:36:53,800 --> 01:36:56,840
I need to get another Sino stone on it, but yeah.

2104
01:36:56,840 --> 01:36:58,600
So that's why I need to do a trade with you today.

2105
01:36:58,600 --> 01:37:01,160
Those Sino stones are hard to get, but yeah, I'll trade with you.

2106
01:37:01,160 --> 01:37:01,640
No problem.

2107
01:37:01,640 --> 01:37:02,140
Yeah.

2108
01:37:03,320 --> 01:37:04,120
All right.

2109
01:37:04,120 --> 01:37:05,560
Uh, moving on just a couple more stories.

2110
01:37:05,560 --> 01:37:08,200
Then we're going to open up Discord for your calls.

2111
01:37:08,200 --> 01:37:11,880
If you want to give us a call over at vognetwork.com slash discord.

2112
01:37:11,880 --> 01:37:12,380
Loki.

2113
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:22,600
So somebody has actually taken it upon themselves to remake, uh, Elder Scrolls Daggerfall in Unity.

2114
01:37:23,320 --> 01:37:27,080
So it's a project that they started back in 2014 Daggerfall Unity.

2115
01:37:27,720 --> 01:37:33,800
Uh, apparently they were trying to figure out how to actually port it to a modern PC

2116
01:37:33,800 --> 01:37:36,520
because right now it's been played through DOS box.

2117
01:37:36,520 --> 01:37:43,640
So he reverse engineered, um, basically how everything was kind of being read,

2118
01:37:43,640 --> 01:37:45,640
all the different textures and stuff.

2119
01:37:45,640 --> 01:37:47,560
And now they've put it in there.

2120
01:37:47,560 --> 01:37:55,800
Apparently it is the largest elder school game with a 62,394 square miles of in-game world.

2121
01:37:56,840 --> 01:37:59,640
So it says it takes 60 hours to cross on foot.

2122
01:38:00,840 --> 01:38:01,800
That's pretty crazy.

2123
01:38:02,440 --> 01:38:02,680
Yeah.

2124
01:38:02,680 --> 01:38:06,520
Those, those older elder scrolls games, probably because they weren't as graphic intensive.

2125
01:38:06,520 --> 01:38:09,960
So the design of the world didn't necessarily need to be as much, you know,

2126
01:38:09,960 --> 01:38:14,440
like you look at a game like Skyrim and the environmental detail that goes into that.

2127
01:38:14,440 --> 01:38:18,360
That's, you know, even though that world is massive, it is smaller than compared to

2128
01:38:18,360 --> 01:38:21,160
these other games where you didn't have to have that same level of detail video.

2129
01:38:21,160 --> 01:38:22,200
It's pretty crazy.

2130
01:38:22,200 --> 01:38:22,520
Yeah.

2131
01:38:22,520 --> 01:38:23,320
It looks awesome.

2132
01:38:23,320 --> 01:38:29,160
So they did release, um, apparently some tools for Unity back in 2015.

2133
01:38:29,160 --> 01:38:36,280
Um, although now it's, you know, getting more further along, basically it says, um,

2134
01:38:36,280 --> 01:38:43,080
that they have the alpha build, which allows, um, Daggerfall to be played start to finish in Unity.

2135
01:38:43,880 --> 01:38:46,920
Um, it's just crazy.

2136
01:38:46,920 --> 01:38:48,520
Just the stuff that they have in here.

2137
01:38:48,520 --> 01:38:55,800
So apparently they do, he does have a page dedicated to his process or progress.

2138
01:38:55,800 --> 01:39:03,000
So, uh, at the website, www.dfworkshop.net and that's under his projects, Daggerfall unity.

2139
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:05,800
And so they have the different builds that are available and stuff for that.

2140
01:39:06,440 --> 01:39:13,320
But, um, the brand new build, he has, um, it's alpha 10.3 and it's available.

2141
01:39:13,320 --> 01:39:16,600
You can download on a windows Mac and Linux.

2142
01:39:16,600 --> 01:39:20,360
Kind of makes you wonder why Bethesda hasn't bothered to go back and do, you know, some,

2143
01:39:20,360 --> 01:39:23,320
some redoing of their own, but I guess, you know, it is a lot of work.

2144
01:39:23,320 --> 01:39:24,680
This guy didn't get paid to do it.

2145
01:39:25,160 --> 01:39:29,400
Cause if they were to go back and use Unity, that would mean working outside their own engine,

2146
01:39:29,400 --> 01:39:34,600
which, you know, if they can port it into their broken ass engine to make new games.

2147
01:39:34,600 --> 01:39:38,440
And they wouldn't want to take resources away from elder scrolls six, which I'm sure is,

2148
01:39:38,440 --> 01:39:41,160
you know, something that they need to have their attention on.

2149
01:39:41,160 --> 01:39:46,440
So, uh, Questbuster also points out Daggerfall used a kind of procedural generation

2150
01:39:46,440 --> 01:39:50,280
to create such a huge map littered with towns, villages, and cities.

2151
01:39:50,280 --> 01:39:53,320
You could try to walk across it or just use quick travel.

2152
01:39:53,320 --> 01:39:54,200
That's true too.

2153
01:39:54,280 --> 01:39:57,720
There was a lot more just kind of like procedural generation, uh,

2154
01:39:57,720 --> 01:40:02,920
as in what you see in no man's sky is a great example of, you know, how vast you can make

2155
01:40:02,920 --> 01:40:04,520
things with procedural generation.

2156
01:40:04,520 --> 01:40:08,440
I mean, when you think about how fucking big a game like no man's sky is, it really like

2157
01:40:09,400 --> 01:40:12,760
makes your mind, you know, makes you go cross-eyed, but that's all an algorithm

2158
01:40:12,760 --> 01:40:16,200
basically that creates everything and creates it the same way for every player.

2159
01:40:16,200 --> 01:40:19,640
So pretty neat, but yeah, it would be a similar concept to what you would have seen as some

2160
01:40:19,640 --> 01:40:22,040
of these older, uh, elder scrolls games.

2161
01:40:22,040 --> 01:40:22,840
So very cool.

2162
01:40:23,400 --> 01:40:23,800
All right.

2163
01:40:23,800 --> 01:40:28,200
Anyway, uh, one more story for you guys and boy, did I save the best for last because

2164
01:40:28,200 --> 01:40:30,360
I know folks are very excited.

2165
01:40:30,360 --> 01:40:33,080
Uh, they want to hear all about new carting games.

2166
01:40:33,080 --> 01:40:35,400
I know y'all are big on Mario Kart, right?

2167
01:40:35,400 --> 01:40:39,000
Well, this isn't about a new Mario Kart game, but I would say it's just as important.

2168
01:40:40,040 --> 01:40:40,760
That's right.

2169
01:40:40,760 --> 01:40:45,560
Uh, this past week we had the announcement of a brand new Garfield Kart game.

2170
01:40:46,120 --> 01:40:47,480
They're making a sequel.

2171
01:40:47,480 --> 01:40:50,440
The original Garfield Kart came out in 2013.

2172
01:40:50,440 --> 01:40:53,240
Then it was remastered or something in 2018.

2173
01:40:53,240 --> 01:40:56,360
And then, uh, I guess, I don't know, it was, it was taken down.

2174
01:40:56,360 --> 01:40:57,080
I don't know, whatever.

2175
01:40:57,080 --> 01:40:59,160
Why would you remaster that game?

2176
01:40:59,160 --> 01:41:00,120
Why not?

2177
01:41:00,120 --> 01:41:01,480
Loki, why not?

2178
01:41:01,480 --> 01:41:03,480
Why would you do dagger fall in unity?

2179
01:41:03,480 --> 01:41:04,920
Because you can.

2180
01:41:04,920 --> 01:41:06,280
Because you liked that.

2181
01:41:06,280 --> 01:41:06,680
That's right.

2182
01:41:06,680 --> 01:41:07,560
Elder Scrolls game.

2183
01:41:07,560 --> 01:41:07,960
That's right.

2184
01:41:07,960 --> 01:41:13,240
Anyway, uh, the game will be getting a sequel on Xbox one, PC, PS4, PC, and switch.

2185
01:41:13,240 --> 01:41:15,560
Believe it or not, it is again, a cart racing game.

2186
01:41:15,560 --> 01:41:17,320
Why is that in the Presley's?

2187
01:41:17,320 --> 01:41:20,360
It is a cart racing game again, just in case you were unclear.

2188
01:41:21,240 --> 01:41:22,280
It was going to be a car racer.

2189
01:41:22,280 --> 01:41:23,080
There you go.

2190
01:41:23,080 --> 01:41:26,680
Uh, Garfield, Odie and John will be the only stars in it.

2191
01:41:26,680 --> 01:41:30,120
Uh, but there's five other characters, I guess that you unlock later on.

2192
01:41:30,120 --> 01:41:33,880
Uh, 16 tracks that are inspired by the world of Garfield.

2193
01:41:33,880 --> 01:41:34,840
How about that?

2194
01:41:34,840 --> 01:41:38,920
Garfield furious racing is coming out in November.

2195
01:41:38,920 --> 01:41:42,600
So, uh, let's see if the intro says things like, are you lazy?

2196
01:41:42,600 --> 01:41:46,200
Like Garfield take shortcuts to overtake the other racers with the spring.

2197
01:41:48,280 --> 01:41:50,120
I'm sure this game is going to win.

2198
01:41:50,120 --> 01:41:52,200
All the awards later this year.

2199
01:41:52,200 --> 01:41:55,640
When we start looking at the game of the year qualifiers and so forth.

2200
01:41:56,200 --> 01:41:59,720
Uh, some comments in chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network.

2201
01:41:59,720 --> 01:42:03,480
Dark did see it says at least Garfield cart won't have any microtransactions.

2202
01:42:03,480 --> 01:42:06,920
Like the crash cart remaster just got later on after the reviews came out.

2203
01:42:08,280 --> 01:42:14,040
Hopefully, uh, Sia Tabiri says I wanted Garfield cart minus Garfield.

2204
01:42:14,040 --> 01:42:16,920
Good comment.

2205
01:42:16,920 --> 01:42:21,480
I would love a Garfield game that like fully leaned into the Garfield names.

2206
01:42:21,480 --> 01:42:25,880
Sia Tabiri says it's all actually just John driving around alone.

2207
01:42:27,480 --> 01:42:28,920
I would love a meme cart.

2208
01:42:28,920 --> 01:42:31,400
I mean, like a code to put in that would just do that.

2209
01:42:31,400 --> 01:42:34,360
But then how do you get angry Luigi and meet meme racer?

2210
01:42:34,360 --> 01:42:35,000
I don't know.

2211
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:35,800
Anyway.

2212
01:42:35,800 --> 01:42:37,400
Um, let's see.

2213
01:42:37,400 --> 01:42:38,760
And also, uh, what was the other comment?

2214
01:42:38,760 --> 01:42:42,280
Oh, guys, you don't chat says I want to Heathcliff cart screw Garfield.

2215
01:42:44,440 --> 01:42:45,560
Maybe they could team up.

2216
01:42:45,560 --> 01:42:48,280
Wasn't Garfield the same one that was paired with us?

2217
01:42:48,280 --> 01:42:51,320
Uh, acres at one point during its run on TV.

2218
01:42:51,320 --> 01:42:51,640
Yes.

2219
01:42:51,640 --> 01:42:53,960
And we know who else was in us acres.

2220
01:42:53,960 --> 01:42:55,000
Our buddy Greg burger.

2221
01:42:55,560 --> 01:42:56,280
Oh, that's right.

2222
01:42:56,280 --> 01:42:57,160
He was.

2223
01:42:57,160 --> 01:42:57,640
Yep.

2224
01:42:57,640 --> 01:42:58,280
Yeah.

2225
01:42:58,280 --> 01:42:58,760
Oh man.

2226
01:42:58,760 --> 01:42:59,320
Good times.

2227
01:42:59,320 --> 01:42:59,880
Orson.

2228
01:42:59,880 --> 01:43:00,440
That's right.

2229
01:43:00,440 --> 01:43:02,120
He was good time.

2230
01:43:02,120 --> 01:43:02,920
And Grimlock.

2231
01:43:05,080 --> 01:43:05,560
All right.

2232
01:43:05,560 --> 01:43:08,520
Anyway, we are at the point in the show where we're going to take your calls.

2233
01:43:08,520 --> 01:43:12,440
So if you want to give us a call, you can join us on our discord vog network.com slash

2234
01:43:12,680 --> 01:43:17,880
And I'll have, you know, I'll have, you know, just in case you're saying that Heathcliff

2235
01:43:17,880 --> 01:43:19,000
deserves a race game.

2236
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:21,240
They did have a Heathcliff racing game.

2237
01:43:21,240 --> 01:43:27,160
Heathcliff the fast and the furriest also came out on the Wii in 2010.

2238
01:43:27,160 --> 01:43:27,480
Thanks.

2239
01:43:28,120 --> 01:43:31,240
Well, this isn't necessarily about video games.

2240
01:43:31,240 --> 01:43:33,000
It goes back to our opening topic.

2241
01:43:33,800 --> 01:43:38,360
Um, the website 8chan has been taken down by the hosting company.

2242
01:43:39,240 --> 01:43:39,720
Oh, wow.

2243
01:43:40,600 --> 01:43:45,480
So, um, after, you know, cloud fair just said, take it down.

2244
01:43:45,480 --> 01:43:49,240
They also took down the daily stormer, you know, two years ago, but it found another

2245
01:43:49,240 --> 01:43:50,360
place with their competition.

2246
01:43:50,920 --> 01:43:58,440
But I'm just saying that when a supposedly neutral hosting company is done with you,

2247
01:43:58,440 --> 01:44:04,040
you know, your shit, not the shit, but literal shit you have come out of someone's ass.

2248
01:44:05,640 --> 01:44:06,840
Just saying, thank you for that.

2249
01:44:07,640 --> 01:44:07,960
All right.

2250
01:44:08,280 --> 01:44:13,080
Uh, if you want to give us a call, uh, vog network.com slash discord, uh, we would also

2251
01:44:13,080 --> 01:44:17,880
welcome comments or questions in our chat room over at twitch TV slash vog network.

2252
01:44:17,880 --> 01:44:21,320
If you wish to, uh, just ask us, maybe you're too shy to call in.

2253
01:44:21,320 --> 01:44:24,520
You just want to ask a question that would be okay as well.

2254
01:44:24,520 --> 01:44:27,320
Otherwise it's going to be an early night here at all our studios tonight, but that's

2255
01:44:27,320 --> 01:44:27,800
all right.

2256
01:44:27,800 --> 01:44:31,160
That's the way it goes sometimes, especially because we didn't have a break segment tonight.

2257
01:44:31,160 --> 01:44:32,440
Um, do you have any last minute stories?

2258
01:44:32,440 --> 01:44:32,840
Logie?

2259
01:44:34,040 --> 01:44:34,540
Nope.

2260
01:44:35,400 --> 01:44:35,880
All right.

2261
01:44:35,880 --> 01:44:37,240
I don't have anything.

2262
01:44:37,240 --> 01:44:39,960
Things are a little slow tonight here at studio OLR.

2263
01:44:39,960 --> 01:44:41,320
What else do we talk about?

2264
01:44:41,320 --> 01:44:45,160
Any, any, uh, cool collectibles or purchases in your home lately?

2265
01:44:45,160 --> 01:44:46,120
Dark Sakura.

2266
01:44:46,120 --> 01:44:48,440
I keep looking at my little indie arcade collection.

2267
01:44:48,440 --> 01:44:50,520
I'm like, I wonder if there's more of those I'm behind on.

2268
01:44:50,520 --> 01:44:53,960
I need to get, um, well, California extreme.

2269
01:44:53,960 --> 01:44:59,080
I got my puka and, um, fry gar that, that doesn't count.

2270
01:45:00,600 --> 01:45:04,360
I'm playing a lot of Sims and all I've done is build two houses.

2271
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:08,520
Uh, as Joe and her map points out, Evo is probably consuming some folks who normally

2272
01:45:08,520 --> 01:45:09,160
call.

2273
01:45:09,160 --> 01:45:10,120
Absolutely.

2274
01:45:10,120 --> 01:45:12,600
I know Ramas at Brony Con, right?

2275
01:45:12,600 --> 01:45:13,000
Yeah.

2276
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:15,720
Like it wasn't like the last one or something like that was this weekend.

2277
01:45:15,720 --> 01:45:16,520
I heard something about that.

2278
01:45:16,520 --> 01:45:18,360
It was like the last Brony Con or something.

2279
01:45:18,360 --> 01:45:20,520
So I know he and Patty were cosplaying.

2280
01:45:20,520 --> 01:45:21,720
Yeah, no, I saw that.

2281
01:45:21,720 --> 01:45:26,200
So I, uh, yeah, I'm sure they'll talk about it on anime jam session this week on Tuesday.

2282
01:45:26,200 --> 01:45:26,700
So, yeah.

2283
01:45:27,240 --> 01:45:30,680
Have you guys been noticing too, uh, here at VOG network, if you, uh, tune in earlier

2284
01:45:30,680 --> 01:45:32,760
in the day on Sundays, uh, girls gone, wow.

2285
01:45:32,760 --> 01:45:33,960
They broadcast on Twitch.

2286
01:45:34,120 --> 01:45:38,440
So sometimes if you tune into our channel around, uh, probably about like three o'clock

2287
01:45:38,440 --> 01:45:43,240
Pacific or so, maybe two, maybe earlier, uh, you will see, uh, Raven and EJ doing their

2288
01:45:43,240 --> 01:45:44,680
show, uh, here on Twitch.

2289
01:45:44,680 --> 01:45:45,880
So that's pretty cool too.

2290
01:45:45,880 --> 01:45:46,600
We love that.

2291
01:45:46,600 --> 01:45:50,360
A lot of our longtime podcast buddies are coming over to Twitch and making the jump

2292
01:45:50,360 --> 01:45:50,760
over here.

2293
01:45:50,760 --> 01:45:51,480
Pretty cool.

2294
01:45:51,480 --> 01:45:52,760
Oh, we have somebody in the green room.

2295
01:45:52,760 --> 01:45:53,400
Let's get to it.

2296
01:45:53,400 --> 01:45:55,000
It won't be a quiet night after all.

2297
01:45:55,000 --> 01:45:56,520
Uh, hi, you are on orange launch radio.

2298
01:45:56,520 --> 01:45:56,920
Who's this?

2299
01:45:57,880 --> 01:45:58,520
Yo, what's up guys?

2300
01:45:58,520 --> 01:45:59,400
This is guys Judo.

2301
01:45:59,400 --> 01:46:00,040
Hey guys, Judo.

2302
01:46:00,040 --> 01:46:00,520
Good to hear from you.

2303
01:46:00,520 --> 01:46:01,400
What's on your mind tonight?

2304
01:46:02,360 --> 01:46:06,200
Um, I'm a little concerned about no man's sky and, uh, the VR update.

2305
01:46:06,920 --> 01:46:09,640
How so I can hear myself in the background.

2306
01:46:09,640 --> 01:46:10,520
That's weird.

2307
01:46:10,520 --> 01:46:10,840
Sorry.

2308
01:46:10,840 --> 01:46:15,240
And we might have, the volume might've been up a little high and sometimes it gets picked

2309
01:46:15,240 --> 01:46:16,200
up on the microphone.

2310
01:46:16,200 --> 01:46:18,360
So we try to minimize that, but it happens.

2311
01:46:18,360 --> 01:46:19,240
Go ahead with your question.

2312
01:46:20,440 --> 01:46:20,760
All right.

2313
01:46:20,760 --> 01:46:25,000
So we all know that the reason why we're getting this, uh, well, not, not the reason why we're

2314
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:29,080
getting the, uh, VR update, but one of the main reasons why we got this new no man's

2315
01:46:29,080 --> 01:46:30,920
sky is just because of all the complaints.

2316
01:46:30,920 --> 01:46:33,720
People were saying, you know, this wasn't a game that you promised us and yada, yada,

2317
01:46:33,720 --> 01:46:34,520
yada.

2318
01:46:34,520 --> 01:46:39,080
And I feel like that's starting to build up again with this VR thing.

2319
01:46:39,080 --> 01:46:41,480
Cause I mean, the VR community is going crazy.

2320
01:46:41,480 --> 01:46:43,160
Like they're acting like this is the second coming.

2321
01:46:43,160 --> 01:46:44,440
They're like, this is going to be great.

2322
01:46:44,440 --> 01:46:45,480
This is what VR needs.

2323
01:46:45,480 --> 01:46:50,440
And I'm just like, I don't know if it's going to be, I don't know if it's going to be as

2324
01:46:50,440 --> 01:46:52,440
big and special as you think it might be.

2325
01:46:52,440 --> 01:46:54,920
You know, I want it to be, but I don't think so.

2326
01:46:54,920 --> 01:46:59,160
Like, I'm not, you know, it's not because I have any beef with, with, uh, with hello

2327
01:46:59,160 --> 01:47:01,560
games or anything like that, because I love the original no man's sky.

2328
01:47:01,560 --> 01:47:05,480
I think I actually call your show and tell you guys that I was satisfied with what they

2329
01:47:05,480 --> 01:47:07,240
originally made, you know?

2330
01:47:07,240 --> 01:47:10,680
So it's not, you know, it's not me complaining, thinking that they can't build a better game,

2331
01:47:10,680 --> 01:47:12,840
but I'm just like, I don't know.

2332
01:47:12,840 --> 01:47:15,240
You guys might want to slow down a little bit on that.

2333
01:47:15,240 --> 01:47:17,000
And I feel like I'm with you.

2334
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:17,560
I'm with you.

2335
01:47:17,560 --> 01:47:19,400
Don't set the bar too high.

2336
01:47:19,400 --> 01:47:21,080
Don't get your expectations too high.

2337
01:47:21,080 --> 01:47:22,200
Cause you're exactly right.

2338
01:47:22,200 --> 01:47:24,360
This is the exact same mistake people made.

2339
01:47:24,440 --> 01:47:26,280
The first time around with the game.

2340
01:47:26,280 --> 01:47:30,760
And I think for those of us that didn't buy into the hype as much, we weren't as disappointed

2341
01:47:30,760 --> 01:47:33,880
with the font because I remember saying with those early, early press conferences, the

2342
01:47:33,880 --> 01:47:35,960
no man's sky, like show me the fucking game.

2343
01:47:35,960 --> 01:47:38,680
And until they do, I'm not going to get my hopes up that high.

2344
01:47:38,680 --> 01:47:43,080
And you know, because I didn't get my hopes up that high, I was okay with the first no

2345
01:47:43,080 --> 01:47:44,040
man's sky they put out.

2346
01:47:44,040 --> 01:47:47,240
Like I didn't think it was going to be like game of the year, but I didn't think it was

2347
01:47:47,240 --> 01:47:49,720
like as shitty as a lot of people made it out to be.

2348
01:47:49,720 --> 01:47:54,040
Now, I think it's amazing and a great, you know, comeback story.

2349
01:47:54,040 --> 01:47:59,160
And honestly, like, you know, with as much bullying and shit as hello games got over

2350
01:47:59,160 --> 01:48:03,800
the first release of that game, we're just honestly damn lucky that they've stuck with

2351
01:48:03,800 --> 01:48:07,960
it and really invested so much more in it and made it a better game and a game that

2352
01:48:07,960 --> 01:48:09,800
I think a lot more people want to check out.

2353
01:48:09,800 --> 01:48:14,280
And I think it's awesome that we're even getting VR in the first place, but I don't believe

2354
01:48:14,280 --> 01:48:17,160
this game was really designed for VR.

2355
01:48:17,160 --> 01:48:21,720
So I think inherently, it's probably not going to be the second coming of VR Jesus

2356
01:48:21,720 --> 01:48:22,440
or whatever you want to call it.

2357
01:48:22,440 --> 01:48:24,520
It's not going to be Beat Saber, something like that.

2358
01:48:24,520 --> 01:48:26,760
That is like a definitive VR app.

2359
01:48:26,760 --> 01:48:29,320
I think it'll be, but I don't think it'll be bad either.

2360
01:48:29,320 --> 01:48:34,040
I mean, we'll see on the 14th, but I think it's going to be kind of cool to play a couple

2361
01:48:34,040 --> 01:48:34,280
times.

2362
01:48:34,280 --> 01:48:36,440
I think it'll be fun to have that immersion.

2363
01:48:36,440 --> 01:48:41,880
No man's sky isn't necessarily a frantically placed game unless you're like me and you

2364
01:48:41,880 --> 01:48:43,880
shoot the wrong aliens and they all start coming for you.

2365
01:48:44,680 --> 01:48:47,240
But for the most part, it's not that frantic of a game.

2366
01:48:47,240 --> 01:48:52,840
So I don't expect that VR is going to be a very hard thing to do in No Man's Sky.

2367
01:48:52,840 --> 01:48:55,400
But I think it'll be neat.

2368
01:48:55,400 --> 01:48:58,360
Some of the worlds in No Man's Sky are really beautiful.

2369
01:48:58,360 --> 01:49:02,200
I remember Bobby and I ended up on some planet that was peaceful and it was a really good

2370
01:49:02,200 --> 01:49:03,800
looking tropical planet.

2371
01:49:03,800 --> 01:49:05,960
I would love to see that again in VR.

2372
01:49:05,960 --> 01:49:07,080
I think it's going to be cool.

2373
01:49:07,080 --> 01:49:11,640
I will probably start over on No Man's Sky for the fifth time when this VR update comes

2374
01:49:11,640 --> 01:49:11,800
out.

2375
01:49:12,520 --> 01:49:13,400
I'm excited to see it.

2376
01:49:14,280 --> 01:49:17,400
Yeah, because I think VR was always planned for it.

2377
01:49:17,400 --> 01:49:22,600
So I always thought the VR mode is just going to be more like you're just viewing things

2378
01:49:22,600 --> 01:49:23,160
in VR.

2379
01:49:23,160 --> 01:49:26,760
I didn't really think it was going to be a major part of the game.

2380
01:49:26,760 --> 01:49:30,280
The way people are talking online, they feel like they're going to be flying to different

2381
01:49:30,280 --> 01:49:34,840
planets, hanging out with their friends in their VR living room, watching a VR TV.

2382
01:49:35,800 --> 01:49:37,720
They got these big high hopes for it.

2383
01:49:37,720 --> 01:49:45,400
I'm just like, I just hope Hello Games, you know, that they will not learn their lesson

2384
01:49:45,400 --> 01:49:48,360
because like I said, I don't think there was a lesson for them to learn, but I hope they

2385
01:49:49,560 --> 01:49:53,960
realize like, okay, we don't want to get the hopes up and we're just going to have to like

2386
01:49:53,960 --> 01:49:59,240
really deliver on this VR and give them as close to what we think they want as we can

2387
01:49:59,240 --> 01:49:59,640
do.

2388
01:49:59,640 --> 01:50:01,400
You know, so hopefully they got that done.

2389
01:50:02,120 --> 01:50:04,120
I don't pin this one on Hello Games.

2390
01:50:04,120 --> 01:50:06,840
I think they're just doing the normal level hype.

2391
01:50:07,240 --> 01:50:08,680
Of course they put out trailers.

2392
01:50:08,680 --> 01:50:10,600
Of course they put out screenshots and things.

2393
01:50:10,600 --> 01:50:11,560
That's what you're supposed to do.

2394
01:50:11,560 --> 01:50:13,640
That's what any game company does about their product.

2395
01:50:13,640 --> 01:50:15,240
They're proud of what they're doing.

2396
01:50:15,240 --> 01:50:20,120
So if people end up disappointed in the VR and No Man's Sky, I don't think Hello Games

2397
01:50:20,120 --> 01:50:21,080
will be the one to blame.

2398
01:50:22,040 --> 01:50:22,440
Right.

2399
01:50:22,440 --> 01:50:22,840
Yeah.

2400
01:50:22,840 --> 01:50:23,160
Yeah.

2401
01:50:23,160 --> 01:50:25,720
And you were talking about collectibles earlier.

2402
01:50:25,720 --> 01:50:28,520
I just wanted to say that I know you got another call coming in.

2403
01:50:28,520 --> 01:50:29,560
Oh no, that's not your other call.

2404
01:50:29,560 --> 01:50:35,800
Anyway, I actually bought the D&D, the Stranger Things D&D starter kit.

2405
01:50:36,520 --> 01:50:37,320
And it's really cool.

2406
01:50:37,320 --> 01:50:37,820
I liked it.

2407
01:50:38,280 --> 01:50:42,360
Oh yeah, because that's all the rage right now with Stranger Things back on TV and the

2408
01:50:42,360 --> 01:50:43,960
kids are playing D&D.

2409
01:50:43,960 --> 01:50:48,040
That is pretty cool, though, that is probably exposing more people to Dungeons and Dragons

2410
01:50:48,040 --> 01:50:51,800
and making them think, oh yeah, that's a thing I should get into as much as we might tease

2411
01:50:51,800 --> 01:50:55,320
the fact that like Stranger Things mania is everywhere.

2412
01:50:55,320 --> 01:50:59,000
You know, it's kind of cool that it's bringing more people into D&D.

2413
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:00,040
Yeah, it's deserved.

2414
01:51:00,040 --> 01:51:01,960
You get five classes.

2415
01:51:01,960 --> 01:51:04,840
Unfortunately, Max isn't in it.

2416
01:51:04,840 --> 01:51:08,600
You don't get a Zoomer class, which I was like, how can you not have this Zoomer class

2417
01:51:08,600 --> 01:51:09,000
in there?

2418
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:10,120
But they don't have that.

2419
01:51:10,120 --> 01:51:13,240
But they have, you know, all the other five kids.

2420
01:51:13,240 --> 01:51:17,880
You know, Eleven, Mike, Dustin, Lucas.

2421
01:51:17,880 --> 01:51:19,320
Well, they're all in there.

2422
01:51:19,320 --> 01:51:19,800
Wait a minute.

2423
01:51:20,440 --> 01:51:24,040
So it's like a Stranger Things D&D where you're actually playing.

2424
01:51:24,040 --> 01:51:25,240
I thought it was just a Stranger Things.

2425
01:51:25,240 --> 01:51:26,360
Yeah, yeah, you're playing that.

2426
01:51:26,360 --> 01:51:30,920
Yeah, if you remember the original season of Stranger Things, the D&D game that they

2427
01:51:30,920 --> 01:51:31,480
were playing.

2428
01:51:32,040 --> 01:51:33,480
You're playing that game.

2429
01:51:33,480 --> 01:51:37,080
Like you actually have Mike's notebook with his notes.

2430
01:51:37,080 --> 01:51:38,280
Like he's the DM.

2431
01:51:38,280 --> 01:51:38,920
Yeah, okay.

2432
01:51:38,920 --> 01:51:43,800
So not to spoil anything, but you go to that Upside Down and all that stuff.

2433
01:51:43,800 --> 01:51:48,040
And they give you two Demogorgon figures, which are really cool.

2434
01:51:48,040 --> 01:51:49,880
Like one is painted, one isn't painted.

2435
01:51:49,880 --> 01:51:50,440
I don't know why.

2436
01:51:51,080 --> 01:51:53,720
But yeah, so it's cool.

2437
01:51:53,720 --> 01:51:54,920
It's only 25 bucks.

2438
01:51:54,920 --> 01:51:57,240
You get that target a lot of different places.

2439
01:51:57,240 --> 01:52:00,760
But it's got me back in the DM and role playing again.

2440
01:52:00,920 --> 01:52:05,080
Like I took a break from it because I really couldn't find a role playing game that I was

2441
01:52:05,080 --> 01:52:09,000
into because I'm drained out on the fantasy thing.

2442
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:11,960
I don't want to do the Wizards and Warlocks and all type of stuff.

2443
01:52:11,960 --> 01:52:15,320
I was trying to find modern day spy era.

2444
01:52:15,320 --> 01:52:20,120
And just recently I found the Marvel superhero role playing game.

2445
01:52:20,120 --> 01:52:22,200
That was like the other game that TSR made.

2446
01:52:22,760 --> 01:52:23,800
And that one is really cool.

2447
01:52:23,800 --> 01:52:26,440
If anybody's in the tabletop gaming, you might want to pick up that.

2448
01:52:26,440 --> 01:52:27,080
And it's free now.

2449
01:52:27,080 --> 01:52:27,960
You can get it online.

2450
01:52:27,960 --> 01:52:28,840
It's like a school.

2451
01:52:29,720 --> 01:52:30,920
Yeah, but it's good game.

2452
01:52:31,800 --> 01:52:32,520
Yeah, you know, it's good.

2453
01:52:33,160 --> 01:52:33,800
Good.

2454
01:52:33,800 --> 01:52:35,320
You know what I used to have back in the day?

2455
01:52:35,320 --> 01:52:37,080
Like this is when I was still in high school.

2456
01:52:38,040 --> 01:52:39,400
Street Fighter RPG.

2457
01:52:40,360 --> 01:52:41,960
I was a fighter to RPG.

2458
01:52:42,920 --> 01:52:43,480
That's nice.

2459
01:52:44,120 --> 01:52:44,600
Yeah.

2460
01:52:44,600 --> 01:52:46,360
And it's better than the angry Joe version, right?

2461
01:52:46,360 --> 01:52:48,920
Because angry Joe, he's doing like a miniature game of it.

2462
01:52:48,920 --> 01:52:54,120
And I think it's going to be crap, even I like angry Joe, but I don't trust him with

2463
01:52:54,120 --> 01:52:55,320
his Kickstarter anyway.

2464
01:52:55,320 --> 01:52:55,480
Yeah.

2465
01:52:55,480 --> 01:52:55,880
So, yeah.

2466
01:52:55,880 --> 01:52:57,320
So try those games.

2467
01:52:57,320 --> 01:53:00,760
Try the Stranger Things, Dungeons and Dragons, and try the TSR.

2468
01:53:01,960 --> 01:53:02,440
What was it?

2469
01:53:02,440 --> 01:53:03,800
Marvel Superheroes, right?

2470
01:53:03,800 --> 01:53:04,600
You can get online now.

2471
01:53:04,600 --> 01:53:08,040
You just go to classicmarble.com and they have all the books, all the supplements.

2472
01:53:08,040 --> 01:53:09,400
You can download them all for free.

2473
01:53:09,960 --> 01:53:10,680
It's a cool system.

2474
01:53:10,680 --> 01:53:11,480
It's a simple system.

2475
01:53:11,480 --> 01:53:13,320
It's not like the D20 system.

2476
01:53:13,320 --> 01:53:14,760
You're using percentile dice.

2477
01:53:15,480 --> 01:53:16,040
It's really easy.

2478
01:53:17,000 --> 01:53:18,680
I just have one thing to say to you.

2479
01:53:20,120 --> 01:53:21,400
Second edition D and D.

2480
01:53:24,040 --> 01:53:25,400
I still have all my stuff.

2481
01:53:25,400 --> 01:53:26,680
I know what my THACO is.

2482
01:53:27,480 --> 01:53:29,480
Awesome.

2483
01:53:29,480 --> 01:53:31,320
Or if you just want to migraine play Rifts.

2484
01:53:32,520 --> 01:53:33,240
All right.

2485
01:53:33,240 --> 01:53:35,640
My friend, I'm going to let you go, but thanks so much for the call.

2486
01:53:35,640 --> 01:53:37,720
All right, take care, buddy.

2487
01:53:37,720 --> 01:53:39,160
VR in the future.

2488
01:53:39,160 --> 01:53:39,480
All right.

2489
01:53:40,360 --> 01:53:40,760
See ya.

2490
01:53:41,560 --> 01:53:42,040
All right.

2491
01:53:42,040 --> 01:53:42,280
Yeah.

2492
01:53:42,280 --> 01:53:43,880
Maybe I'll see him in No Man's Sky.

2493
01:53:43,880 --> 01:53:44,440
Who knows?

2494
01:53:44,440 --> 01:53:45,160
Anything like that.

2495
01:53:45,720 --> 01:53:46,360
I love it.

2496
01:53:46,360 --> 01:53:46,600
Anyway.

2497
01:53:46,600 --> 01:53:49,320
All that talk about VR Jesus made me think of The Lawnmower Man.

2498
01:53:50,040 --> 01:53:50,520
How so?

2499
01:53:51,080 --> 01:53:54,120
Just, I was trying to think of what VR Jesus would be.

2500
01:53:54,120 --> 01:53:56,440
And all I could think of was The Lawnmower Man.

2501
01:53:56,440 --> 01:53:57,000
That movie.

2502
01:53:57,640 --> 01:54:00,280
I haven't seen that in probably since it first came out.

2503
01:54:00,280 --> 01:54:01,080
In the theater.

2504
01:54:01,080 --> 01:54:02,680
And that was the last time I saw it.

2505
01:54:02,680 --> 01:54:03,160
Oh, wow.

2506
01:54:04,280 --> 01:54:05,320
I just don't remember it.

2507
01:54:05,320 --> 01:54:06,040
Weird as fuck.

2508
01:54:06,040 --> 01:54:06,760
Yeah, it was weird.

2509
01:54:07,640 --> 01:54:10,840
90s interpretations of computer culture are always great.

2510
01:54:10,840 --> 01:54:14,760
Like The Net starring Sandra Bullock, or of course the movie Hackers.

2511
01:54:14,760 --> 01:54:17,640
Like these are hilarious things to go back and watch.

2512
01:54:17,640 --> 01:54:21,560
Heck, even the original Jurassic Park kind of had some funny computer stuff in it.

2513
01:54:21,560 --> 01:54:21,880
You know?

2514
01:54:23,640 --> 01:54:25,080
You didn't say the magic word.

2515
01:54:27,800 --> 01:54:28,200
Anyway.

2516
01:54:28,840 --> 01:54:29,240
All right.

2517
01:54:29,240 --> 01:54:30,120
That's it for calls.

2518
01:54:30,120 --> 01:54:31,880
We didn't have anything else on the line.

2519
01:54:31,880 --> 01:54:33,640
So we're about to wrap up.

2520
01:54:33,640 --> 01:54:37,640
If there's no other last minute stories, I guess we're moving to wrap up for the night.

2521
01:54:37,640 --> 01:54:40,840
But we will be back next week, except for Dark Sakura, sadly.

2522
01:54:40,840 --> 01:54:44,600
But well, not too sad for us, but not that sad.

2523
01:54:44,600 --> 01:54:49,080
Maybe he'll sing Jurassic Park is frightening in the dark.

2524
01:54:49,080 --> 01:54:50,440
Are you doing meet and greet again or no?

2525
01:54:50,440 --> 01:54:51,320
Because you already did that.

2526
01:54:51,320 --> 01:54:53,880
Yeah, we did that for our 10th anniversary.

2527
01:54:54,440 --> 01:54:58,760
So we're thinking next year of putting the money aside and going to Disney World.

2528
01:54:59,560 --> 01:55:00,680
That'll be fun.

2529
01:55:00,680 --> 01:55:02,520
I've never been to Disney World and I really want to go.

2530
01:55:02,520 --> 01:55:04,600
But we're doing we're doing the Star Trek Cruise next year.

2531
01:55:05,320 --> 01:55:07,800
Thanks to I almost said it.

2532
01:55:07,800 --> 01:55:10,040
I always call him by his last name and I got to stop doing that.

2533
01:55:10,040 --> 01:55:14,280
But thanks to Grandpa or Captain Matt from Starboard Power Company.

2534
01:55:15,320 --> 01:55:18,040
We're going on that cruise and they just announced over the weekend because there's

2535
01:55:18,040 --> 01:55:20,600
been a big Star Trek convention going on in Las Vegas this weekend, too.

2536
01:55:20,600 --> 01:55:22,040
They just announced Jerry Ryan.

2537
01:55:22,280 --> 01:55:23,400
Sarah was there.

2538
01:55:23,400 --> 01:55:23,880
That's right.

2539
01:55:23,880 --> 01:55:24,840
Tara was there.

2540
01:55:24,840 --> 01:55:25,000
Yeah.

2541
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:26,440
But Jerry Ryan is going to be on the cruise.

2542
01:55:26,440 --> 01:55:29,080
So trailer I did.

2543
01:55:29,080 --> 01:55:29,720
Oh, my God.

2544
01:55:29,720 --> 01:55:30,920
It looks so good.

2545
01:55:30,920 --> 01:55:31,640
Right.

2546
01:55:31,640 --> 01:55:32,360
I'm so far behind.

2547
01:55:32,360 --> 01:55:34,200
I still haven't watched season two of Discovery.

2548
01:55:34,200 --> 01:55:38,680
And I think I think I had the big twist spoiled for me and I'm a little irritated, but I'm

2549
01:55:38,680 --> 01:55:39,400
still going to watch it.

2550
01:55:40,120 --> 01:55:41,640
I haven't watched any Discovery.

2551
01:55:41,640 --> 01:55:48,360
But I mean, the thing is, is that I had read like all of the like the big end book with

2552
01:55:48,360 --> 01:55:49,560
the Borg and all that.

2553
01:55:49,640 --> 01:55:55,800
And so part of my brain's going like thinking of book continuity and I'll go, no, no, no,

2554
01:55:55,800 --> 01:55:55,960
no.

2555
01:55:55,960 --> 01:56:00,280
Think different, not book, because I read through that going through the Deep Space

2556
01:56:00,280 --> 01:56:02,280
Nine books because I love the Deep Space Nine books.

2557
01:56:02,920 --> 01:56:03,160
Yeah.

2558
01:56:03,720 --> 01:56:06,680
DS9 is the best Star Trek series and you're all wrong if you think otherwise.

2559
01:56:08,680 --> 01:56:12,920
I'm near and dear to Voyager, but that's just because I think that's just more like an emotional

2560
01:56:12,920 --> 01:56:14,920
connection, not based in like fact.

2561
01:56:14,920 --> 01:56:15,560
Do you know what I mean?

2562
01:56:16,200 --> 01:56:16,840
Yeah.

2563
01:56:16,840 --> 01:56:26,360
But, you know, we would call Cisco a captain named Hawk because Avery Brooks was in A Man

2564
01:56:26,360 --> 01:56:26,840
Called Hawk.

2565
01:56:27,960 --> 01:56:30,360
So Questbuster says DS9 is great.

2566
01:56:30,360 --> 01:56:32,600
Under the Pale Moonlight is one of my favorite episodes.

2567
01:56:33,640 --> 01:56:34,520
Such a good episode.

2568
01:56:34,520 --> 01:56:35,480
You're in good company.

2569
01:56:35,480 --> 01:56:37,000
It's a fake.

2570
01:56:37,000 --> 01:56:39,240
Anyway, we'll be back next week.

2571
01:56:39,240 --> 01:56:42,520
Loki and I'll be back next week to entertain you with the week in gaming news.

2572
01:56:42,520 --> 01:56:44,040
We hope you guys will all be here too.

2573
01:56:44,040 --> 01:56:47,720
Bobby Blackall will be back next week live at Twitch to talk about Gen Con.

2574
01:56:47,720 --> 01:56:48,920
So we're going to have a good old time.

2575
01:56:49,960 --> 01:56:53,080
Whether you're here or not, maybe we'll get treated to a phone call, depending on how

2576
01:56:53,080 --> 01:56:53,880
late the concert runs.

2577
01:56:55,160 --> 01:56:57,080
Anyway, well, Dark Soccer.

2578
01:56:57,080 --> 01:57:01,000
Oh, before we get to the final thoughts, as I always say towards the end of the show,

2579
01:57:01,000 --> 01:57:02,520
hey, tell a friend or two about the show.

2580
01:57:02,520 --> 01:57:03,560
Help us spread the word.

2581
01:57:03,560 --> 01:57:07,560
We are the show where every gamer has a voice, but only if the voices are here to put out

2582
01:57:07,560 --> 01:57:08,280
over the air.

2583
01:57:08,280 --> 01:57:11,320
So yeah, be sure to bring those voices to us.

2584
01:57:11,320 --> 01:57:15,080
A nice five star review on a place like iTunes or wherever you found this podcast.

2585
01:57:15,080 --> 01:57:20,200
That goes a long way and also really, really helps the hosts on Twitch.

2586
01:57:20,200 --> 01:57:23,880
Thank you so much to everybody that's put VOG Network in your auto host list.

2587
01:57:24,760 --> 01:57:27,240
Dark Soccer, do you want to start us off with final thoughts tonight?

2588
01:57:27,960 --> 01:57:29,480
Stop killing people, you twat.

2589
01:57:31,240 --> 01:57:35,960
My final thought tonight would be I've really missed streaming on my personal channel,

2590
01:57:35,960 --> 01:57:39,720
but with the Survivor game wrapping up, either I'll get voted out this week or it'll be done

2591
01:57:39,720 --> 01:57:40,280
on Sunday.

2592
01:57:40,920 --> 01:57:44,840
Either way, I should be back to streaming very soon because I want to make sure I build that

2593
01:57:44,840 --> 01:57:49,000
up in advance of Dragon Con with all the streaming stuff that's going to be happening at Dragon

2594
01:57:49,000 --> 01:57:49,240
Con.

2595
01:57:49,240 --> 01:57:50,360
I'm really excited about that.

2596
01:57:51,000 --> 01:57:52,840
Loki, last but not least, your final thoughts?

2597
01:57:52,840 --> 01:57:55,240
I guess I have a course the right in Unity.

2598
01:57:58,120 --> 01:57:59,160
Good luck.

2599
01:57:59,160 --> 01:57:59,880
Good luck.

2600
01:57:59,880 --> 01:58:01,480
We'll be back in seven days.

2601
01:58:01,480 --> 01:58:05,000
Tune in then to find out if Loki was successful in doing any coursing.

2602
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:07,240
Oh yeah, like we'll know by next week.

2603
01:58:07,240 --> 01:58:07,880
Come on.

2604
01:58:07,880 --> 01:58:08,360
Yeah, right.

2605
01:58:08,360 --> 01:58:09,240
Let's be honest here.

2606
01:58:09,640 --> 01:58:10,680
Have a good week, everybody.

2607
01:58:10,680 --> 01:58:11,320
Happy gaming.

2608
01:58:11,320 --> 01:58:11,800
Good night.

2609
01:58:39,240 --> 01:58:39,800
True.

2610
01:58:42,600 --> 01:58:43,800
See you next week.

2611
01:59:09,240 --> 01:59:10,380
Bye.
