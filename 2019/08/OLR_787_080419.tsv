0	18880	This week the Xbox's incredible TV features may have been a few years too early as demonstrated
18880	22120	by the release of Castlevania and the In Progress Witcher and Halo series.
22120	24800	This is just one subject on tonight's show, stay tuned for the rest of the week's gaming
24800	29200	news starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.
29200	37440	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back it's another week of Orange
37440	46080	Lounge Radio live here tonight episode number 787 for this August the 4th of 2019.
46080	49960	My name is Rob Roberts joining you over the next few hours to talk about video games,
49960	54200	gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle and joining me in studio as she always does sometimes
54200	55600	on cam sometimes not.
55600	56600	It's DarkSakura.
56600	57600	My foot's on cam.
57600	58600	There you go.
58600	59600	It's DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
59600	60600	Hi.
60600	61600	Hi.
61600	62600	How are you doing?
62600	63600	I'm here.
63600	64600	Good.
64600	65600	Good.
65600	66600	Glad to have you here.
66600	67600	Yes.
67600	68600	All right.
68600	70360	And also joining us right over there on my other side who is on cam say hello to Tech
70360	71360	Master Loki.
71360	72360	Hello.
72360	73360	Hello.
73360	74360	I'm here.
74360	75360	Good.
75360	77880	We do tape live of course every Sunday night at Twitch TV slash VOG Network.
77880	78980	That's VOG Network.
78980	83380	The Voice of Geeks Network Sunday nights at 6 o'clock Pacific 9 o'clock Eastern usually
83380	87620	right after the Bobby Black Wolf show, but tonight not after the Bobby Black Wolf show.
87620	89400	Bobby was on vacation this week.
89400	92180	He went to Gen Con, so we'll hear all about that.
92180	96840	That's a huge board game convention out in Indianapolis if memory serves me right.
96840	100220	It's one of those things where it's like if I had the money, the budget, and the time
100220	104020	off work, I would love to go to that convention at some point, but sadly not in the cards
104020	105020	for me.
105020	107900	But it was in the cards for Bobby, so we'll hear more about that next week when he gets
107900	108940	back.
108940	110740	But otherwise we're still here live tonight.
110740	114260	So we were treated to EVO, some of the finals going on there.
114260	115620	Yeah for Tekken 7 I think.
115620	118820	Tekken 7 we were watching a little bit here before we went live tonight.
118820	122640	So unfortunately we didn't see who won, but I'm sure somebody will yell it out in chat
122640	126460	because of course if you do want to participate along with the show, we appreciate all the
126460	132220	hellos, hellos in our chat room over at Twitch TV slash VOG Network and some folks making
132220	133280	jokes.
133280	137200	Before we go live, if you've never joined us here at Twitch, we have just a couple minutes
137200	138620	while we're kind of getting things ready.
138620	142940	So we have a little picture of Mr. Smoosh that sits there while some happy music plays
142940	144900	and some folks are making jokes about it.
144900	151400	SG100Matt saying Mr. Smoosh pounces into Smash and Darktacilla says Super Smoosh Brothers.
151400	153980	We actually, I guess it's okay for me to say this.
153980	158780	We actually are going to be adding a Mr. Smoosh emote to the palette of emotes here at VOG
158780	159780	Network.
159780	162260	It was actually supposed to be done a few weeks ago, but we've just been kind of crazy
162260	163260	busy with some stuff.
163260	166740	But that will be something that we'll have in the hopper for you guys before Dragon Con.
166740	168460	So those of you guys, you wanted it, you got it.
169300	170300	You're going to get a Mr. Smoosh emote.
170300	171700	It is going to be very special.
171700	175700	It's going to be for the, we decided to make it a tier two emote sub.
175700	180020	So it's going to be a little bit extra, extra special, but Mr. Smoosh is extra special.
180020	181020	So yes.
181020	182180	All right.
182180	186320	And Questbuster clarifying, no one has won the Tekken Championship yet, but the grand
186320	188180	final matchup is going on now.
188180	191700	The Street Fighter 5-1 ended earlier today with Bonchan as the champ.
191700	195700	Yes, I did see that over on Twitter because I do, I'm a big Twitter person.
195940	198620	Anyway, we're going to get into this gaming news here.
198620	204020	I have a big kickoff topic, some really frustrating news happening here at the top of the show.
204020	207740	However, before we get into that, I did want to say something real quick because I know
207740	212420	there's a lot of stuff going on in the world and specifically America that's on a lot of
212420	217060	people's minds and specifically these back to back horrific shootings that never seem
217060	218580	to leave the news.
218580	222860	And although I'm not one to really want to get super political here on a show that I
222860	228100	know people are trying to escape and get away from video games, where I do take offense,
228100	232300	I guess, I don't know what other way to say it, is that yet again, we see talking heads
232300	237340	going on television and trying to blame it on video games and trying to blame, you know,
237340	239580	what these guys did on video games.
239580	242300	I'm sorry, but that shit is tired.
242300	245860	It's offensive and it's ignorant and it's willfully ignorant.
245860	248900	And I, for one, I'm not going to take that shit anymore.
248900	251480	It's not the video games fault, Congressman.
251480	260760	It's your fault for continuing to do nothing over and over and over again about these situations.
260760	262820	Take some goddamn responsibility.
262820	269000	Do your fucking job and make this country a safer place already.
269000	276440	The responsibility lies in the way these people are being raised in our failed mental health
276440	278280	capacity.
278280	284160	And it lies in this wave of white supremacy that's been flooding the country ever since
284160	286320	the shithole in chief got elected.
286320	290440	And we're not even trying to do something about like, even if it was like, OK, whatever
290440	294020	people are, you know, really wanting, we're not even trying, like, I'm not seeing any
294020	295680	solutions on the table about mental health.
295680	299560	I'm not seeing any table, a solution on the table like Congress people get off the fucking
299560	301840	TV and do your fucking job.
301840	303640	That's so frustrating.
303640	308840	And even so, mental health shouldn't be a scapegoat in this either, because, yeah, you
308840	310600	don't want to put a stigma on it.
310600	311600	I get it.
311600	319500	But we need to make bigots afraid and we need to make them pay for what they do.
319500	324240	And I'm sorry they took this guy in Ohio alive because guess what?
324240	325300	White boy.
325300	328000	It is domestic terrorism.
328000	329760	Call it what it is.
329760	331920	Video games had jack shit to do with this.
331920	332920	Hitler was a painter.
332920	335560	Are we blaming painters for World War Two?
335560	337120	And that's why you mention it.
337120	340440	Well, no, but like, you know, as a vegetarian or vegetarians to blame.
340440	345200	Well, now that you mean well, you know, all that aside, you know, there's there's you
345200	349040	know, since we mentioned Evo at the top of the show, there's thousands and thousands
349040	353500	of gamers at Evo right now, which I would consider like a positive thing.
353500	354880	They're having fun.
354880	355880	It's sports.
355880	356880	It's a great thing.
356880	360360	Video games can be a friendly competition and it's uplifting.
360360	365880	And it's just I am sick of video games being the goddamn scapegoat, knock it off, like
365880	367720	get your head out of your butt.
367720	371100	I'm just I'm not going to take it anymore as a gamer.
371100	372720	And I don't think any of us should.
372720	374440	This is not our fault.
374440	378360	Anyway, sorry, I'll get off the soapbox for now.
378360	381280	But it would have really bugged me if I didn't say anything about it at all.
381280	385840	But I know people do want to listen to this show and play video games to sometimes escape
385840	386840	the real world.
386840	390960	Since we are talking about mental health and trying to stay in a good state of mind,
390960	394000	despite everything that's going on, I don't think there's really anything wrong with that.
394000	398040	You know, sometimes I know people say you shouldn't plug your ears, go la la la and
398040	399320	play video games.
399320	402960	But sometimes I realize like if it's like what you have to do for your own sanity, then
402960	404320	it's what you have to do.
404320	408080	So you know, be just stay informed.
408080	410760	But if you need a break, I don't blame you.
410760	412060	Anyway, let's move on.
412060	413060	Let's get into some gaming news.
413060	415380	I wish I had a happier story to start us off.
415380	418700	But unfortunately, we have kind of a frustrating story starting us off.
418700	422180	It's just a different type, a completely different type of frustrating story, starting us off
422180	423340	at the top of the show.
423340	427600	And this is something that very well could have affected all of us in the room.
427600	432660	Because all of us here in the room have prior attended E3 at one point or another as media.
432660	437540	You know, some years we went as I think general or maybe as you and as like professional or
437540	440460	industry a couple years when you were working with.
440460	443720	But at one point, at least all of us have gone as media.
443720	448620	And unfortunately, for some peers and some people we all here in this room know, some
448620	454940	of our media friends have been impacted by a very severe leak that happened with E3 data.
454940	459100	So what happened, of course, the ESA or the Entertainment Software Association, who puts
459100	462840	on E3, they hand out hundreds of press badges every year.
462840	463840	We know this.
463840	465220	They hand a lot of folks to press.
465220	468860	We've sometimes complained about how hard the process has gotten in recent years.
468860	472580	As things have shifted from, you know, maybe like indie press and podcasts and things
472580	477900	that we do to more like the big social media influencers, the YouTubers, the Twitchers,
477900	481080	the mixers, which we'll get into later, and all of that.
481080	486820	So what this also means is that once you are registered for E3 as press, they have your
486820	490380	name, they have your phone number, they have your address and so forth.
490380	496380	And while a lot of people in the industry might have like a business, like retail estate,
496380	500020	meaning like a business place of employment that they can put as their address, like maybe
500020	505860	they work out of an office in downtown San Francisco or, you know, wherever they're located.
505860	509440	Not everybody, you know, especially when it comes to individual influencers, when it comes
509440	514020	to the more independent homegrown press, we use, and I know we've used in the past, our
514020	517760	home addresses and our home phone numbers because, you know, we're running a business
517760	520580	in our spare time, basically.
520580	525000	So the ESA keeps track of all this information.
525000	529680	They have a reason for doing it because they want to make sure that they're able to give
529680	533880	this information to gaming companies, that gaming companies can contact you to try to
533880	536280	schedule appointments to see games.
536280	540440	And you know, again, we've gone to E3's meeting before, we've received these emails, we've
540440	544180	responded and taken the bait sometimes to see different things at E3.
544180	548960	That's how we have brought you guys in the past, the way past we were going to E3 regularly,
548960	554080	some of the stories and hands-ons and things that we have gotten in the past at E3.
554080	558240	Unfortunately this year, it's gone really, really bad.
558240	564600	A YouTuber actually noticed on the ESA website that there was a button that would allow you
564600	571480	to get a spreadsheet on the site that you could download all of the media information.
571480	575280	I believe, and I'm going to be honest, maybe somebody in chat wants to clarify if they
575280	581000	know, I believe it was something where you kind of had to like log in as a vendor or
581000	584860	as a participant in E3 to see the page.
584860	589240	But once you logged in to see the page, the spreadsheet wasn't locked.
589240	593200	So if you had the link to get to that spreadsheet, which of course, you know, when this came
593200	597760	out, it started spreading around the internet in not so great circles.
597760	602000	As long as you had a link to the spreadsheet, it was not password protected or behind some
602000	603960	type of security or anything like that.
603960	607740	Which is actually a major breach of privacy law.
607740	611640	Especially now in Europe, you know, Europe has very strict internet laws when it comes
611640	612640	to things like that.
612640	613640	Yeah, absolutely.
613640	614640	This is a breach of law.
614640	619860	And unfortunately, you know, the gross thing about the world we live in is that some people
619860	626220	take their frustrations out on games that are or aren't made or are well received or
626220	627580	not so well received.
627580	630860	They take out those frustrations on journalists.
630860	635100	And I'm sorry, but combine it with some of the things and the really gross topics we
635100	637540	were talking about just a few moments ago.
637540	642700	I know a lot of journalist friends that are kind of like somewhere in that realm between
642700	646700	really fucking annoyed and really fucking scared at what just happened.
646700	648060	Because y'all know it.
648060	651460	It happens on Twitch streams and that stuff all the time where that swatting bullshit
651460	656100	happens, you know, because somebody thinks it's funny when it's not funny.
656100	662660	And now they have like the addresses and telephone numbers of many big content creators and press
662660	665160	people and so forth to be able to do that.
665160	666160	It's scary.
666160	667160	It's shocking.
667160	672180	And it's fucking gross that the ESA ever allowed this to happen.
672180	674620	This blows my mind.
674620	680480	They're putting on one of the biggest tech shows in the industry.
680480	686180	And this spreadsheet was out there for anyone to grab without a, if they just had the link,
686180	691700	without a password, without some type of protection or encryption.
691700	693780	What the fuck?
693780	700280	On top of that, giving this information to any kind of vendor at all, just even making
700280	709980	it remotely available for use is by itself detestable.
709980	718700	You know, then having it be so poorly protected is just more like, let me pour some acid in
718700	720300	that wound.
720300	723880	Tiger Claw in chat with a comment that I think ought to be addressed because this is a logical
723880	728460	place where my brain goes about this, you know, because we're thinking about, or at
728460	732660	least I'm thinking about, oh, it's only a matter of time for the class action lawsuit.
732660	734980	It is only a matter of time for the class action lawsuit.
734980	738980	And this time I don't, I don't think it's a frivolous thing.
738980	739980	It is.
739980	742920	This is, if there's a class action lawsuit on this, that is not a frivolous lawsuit.
742920	746020	That is, that is holding the ESA accountable for what they did.
746020	750180	But the Tiger Claw in chat over Twitch TV slash VOG network with a comment that I think
750180	755460	a lot of us are thinking, this is going to have a profound effect for E3 2020.
755460	759360	Some of those gaming journalists will be hesitant on putting their info when registering for
759360	761540	E3 again.
761540	765580	There's already been a lot of questions in the air about the relevance of E3 and do we
765580	767400	need E3?
767400	773340	And now just add this onto that where now journalists are going to give this a second
773340	775860	thought about if they should even register.
775860	780460	Now I'm sure there'll be promises from the ESA about, you know, that they'll, they'll
780460	785620	put, and they did put out a statement, let me read the statement from the ESA, uh, ESA
785620	789260	was made aware of a website vulnerability that led to the contact list of registered
789260	792340	journalists attending E3 being made public.
792340	796300	Once notified, we immediately took steps to protect that data and shut down the site,
796300	797720	which is no longer available.
797720	801940	We regret this occurrence and have measures in place to ensure it will not occur again.
801940	805140	Wait, made aware that they designed the site.
805500	808900	Well, we didn't know what was on our site or how it was formatted or anything like that.
810740	813420	No, you can't claim that kind of negligence.
813420	815700	And a website vulnerability.
815700	817060	It was not a vulnerability.
817060	821060	You just, you, you were stupid and didn't lock the door.
821300	826500	Yeah, it was a poor choice, as, as the great and wonderful and pure Tatiana once said,
827020	831820	choices. And that's what went into that website design, choices.
832820	834860	Uh, comments from chat.
834860	840780	SSU100Matt says the gaming community, while great, such as VOG, can be vile sometimes.
840780	844060	Attacking devs, reviewers, et cetera, because they do not agree with them.
844060	849020	You know, and I really want to truly believe that that is a case of the way too vocal minority.
849020	852060	I think most gamers are pretty cool.
852060	856300	You know, again, look at Evo, look at, you know, some of the like positive stuff going on in gaming.
856300	857900	There's a lot of positive things to talk about.
857900	860380	Unfortunately, there's a lot of shit bags that bring it down for the rest of us.
860380	860980	We all know that.
861540	867060	Um, Questbuster says, I've seen some replies that mentioned that the ESA was told of the
867060	869940	vulnerability a month ago and did nothing.
869940	870180	Yeah.
870180	873620	That was one of the first replies I got to my tweet because I tweeted about this in the
873620	874820	middle of the night, the other night.
874820	877700	And that was one of the first replies I got was that they've known this for a while and
877700	881780	didn't do anything, which is just, you know, again, I don't know what all the facts are
881780	888100	there yet, but if that is proven to be true, then that, I mean, they're, the ESA is about
888180	890340	to have a gigantic court battle on their hands.
890340	895780	And especially if names and addresses of folks in Europe were a part of that, which I imagine
895780	897380	it was, I didn't look at the list.
897380	898500	I don't want to look at the list.
898500	903060	I don't want to even encourage anybody to look for this list because it's not your fucking
903060	907620	business, but assuming that there are, you know, media folks in Europe that were probably
907620	911140	on that list, um, they're going to have a hell of a battle on their hands with this
911140	912020	new Europe law.
912740	918020	So I, and could that have a profound effect on E3?
918740	926180	I, I seem to recall, correct me if I'm wrong chatters, co-hosts, I seem to recall just
926180	930660	a couple months ago, there was a lot of questions and a lot of issues about the guy that's
930660	931940	running the ESA right now.
931940	935540	Wasn't that a thing that was going around in the news about the guy that's running it
935540	938100	and some of his issues that are happening right now?
938100	941700	I, this, this guy, this guy's going to pay for it with his job.
942900	944100	Watch, that's my prediction.
944100	946260	This guy's going to have to answer for it with his job.
946260	946820	He has to.
947700	953620	Anyway, um, let's see, uh, Questbuster says the dump looks like it was just pulled straight
953620	957700	from registration and not scrubbed, which is why the addresses were there likely for
957700	958820	badge mailings.
958820	963220	Uh, Metal Mayhem says scary thought given the social and political situation that's
963220	966660	been enabled by the Cheeto in chief, any of the journalists that happen to be not wide
966660	968580	or straight could be targeted, which is frightening.
968580	971060	Uh, yeah, they, thank you for getting it.
971380	974020	Like, thank you as a white straight guy for getting it.
974020	976260	Like, it is very scary.
976260	980900	And that's why I'm like, thank God that I didn't go to E3 this year.
980900	985700	And I honestly, in my gut, I'm like, were the previous year's spreadsheets up there?
985700	986740	Cause I'm a little worried.
989620	990900	Uh, let's see.
990900	995540	Questbuster says, yeah, Bobby went through the tumult at the ESA a few episodes ago.
995540	996980	I thought that was a thing.
996980	999460	And Pixel Pockets points out they don't mail press badges.
999460	1001300	You have to pick them up at the convention center.
1001300	1001940	That's right.
1001940	1003220	I do remember this being a thing.
1003220	1006100	Oh God, Pixel Pockets, are you, are you impacted by this?
1006100	1008100	Well, did you go to E3 this year as media?
1008100	1012100	If so, I'm like, I don't want to put you on the spot, but I would really love to know
1012100	1012660	your thoughts.
1012660	1014900	I know you have gone to some stuff as media before.
1014900	1015700	Okay.
1015700	1016820	Uh, Pixel Pockets clarifies.
1016820	1018660	I did not go to E3 this year.
1018660	1020740	Fortunately, many of my friends did go.
1020740	1021860	Yeah, many of mine did too.
1021860	1024100	I know other indie podcasters that were there.
1024100	1028500	I have other industry friends that went and I, I feel for them.
1028500	1031140	I'm like, what can I do but be fucking mad?
1031140	1033220	Like, there's just like, what can I do?
1034820	1036100	What can any of us do?
1036100	1037220	It's, it's scary.
1037220	1038260	It's a scary thought.
1038260	1043140	I think a lot of the tips and things that are going around online, like ensure you have
1043140	1045060	two-factor authentication.
1045060	1048820	You might want to change your phone number if you were using your personal phone number.
1048820	1050820	Take some precautions in that regard.
1050820	1052420	I think that's all very good advice.
1052420	1056580	I think two-factor authentication, if you aren't a journalist, is a great thing to have
1056580	1060660	on like you, you really, you really, really should have it on like your email and your
1060660	1061460	banking.
1061460	1064180	If nothing else, everything comes back to your email.
1064180	1066100	You can password reset everything with your email.
1066100	1068660	Have your two-factor auth on your email, please.
1068660	1071220	And your banking is probably pretty important too.
1071220	1076740	So if nothing else, I mean, I have TF, 2FA or whatever you call on everything, but I
1076740	1078980	mean, if nothing else, put it on those things.
1078980	1083380	You can't, you can buy, and speaking of gaming, you can do it on PlayStation Network.
1083380	1084260	You can do it on Microsoft.
1084260	1086420	They pretty much force you with the PlayStation Network.
1086420	1087620	I think they do.
1087620	1089940	Uh, I don't remember if Nintendo has it.
1089940	1090740	I don't think they do.
1093220	1094420	I don't think so.
1094420	1094980	Go ahead.
1094980	1099380	By the way, just going back to the earlier thing before, before I forget, cause actually,
1099380	1102420	um, AOC made a comment about the video game thing.
1103060	1103620	Oh, good.
1103620	1104020	Yeah.
1104020	1105300	I I'd be curious about that.
1105300	1110420	I know she's a polarizing people for some, but she's, she's been, she goes on to video
1110420	1111700	game streams, right?
1111700	1112740	Well, this is her tweet.
1113380	1116020	Video games aren't causing mass shootings.
1116020	1121220	White supremacy is sadly the GOP refused to acknowledge that because their strategy relies
1121220	1123220	on rallying a white supremacist base.
1123220	1128100	That's why the president has stadiums of people chanting, send her back and targets Congress
1128100	1128900	members of color.
1131460	1132660	I will mic drop.
1132660	1135780	Yeah, I, there's, there's nothing to say to follow that.
1135780	1136660	There's nothing to say.
1137300	1138260	Um, let's see.
1138820	1142500	Uh, anyway, um, I'm not sure what else to say about this.
1143300	1144420	It's so frustrating.
1144420	1148820	And again, it's like, I feel for my friends and I'm like, how, how can I help you?
1148820	1151460	If you need to stay at my place, you can stay at my place.
1151460	1152820	Like it's like one of those, like, I don't know.
1152820	1158340	I hope it doesn't get that bad, but I mean, it's just like now that's out there and it's
1158340	1158980	on the internet.
1158980	1164500	And when the next dippy thing happens where they decide to target gaming journalists for
1164500	1172020	some bad opinion or something that they don't agree with, it's just like, I'm so upset.
1172100	1173380	I'm so upset.
1173380	1177220	And the ESA, this statement they put out, it's not good enough.
1177220	1180740	And I think a lot of gamers need to make the ESA aware.
1180740	1185060	I guess I could say this, you know, I know we don't have a gigantic fan base and listener
1185060	1185860	base and so forth.
1185860	1189460	We got, we got a little something here and we all know friends that are gamers as well.
1189460	1195460	And I think, I think we need to voice to the ESA that they need to do better.
1195460	1198900	This is not a sufficient apology, what they've put out here.
1198900	1200340	This is not sufficient.
1200340	1204900	You know, what are they going to do to help protect these people that they've now exposed?
1205860	1207860	What are detail?
1207860	1211220	What are the steps they're going to take to make sure this doesn't happen again?
1211220	1215300	How are they going to, to the best of their ability, stop the spread of this spreadsheet
1215300	1216180	around further?
1216820	1218580	We deserve details.
1218580	1222420	We deserve better answers from a tech company.
1222420	1225380	Jesus Christ, that's the most frustrating thing about this whole thing.
1225380	1227860	Like you're in technology and you let this happen.
1228500	1228900	Barf.
1230420	1233780	Sia Tabiri says, would having a PO box help protect?
1233780	1238100	Do registrations for press badges permit you to list those instead of physical addresses?
1238100	1241860	And Pixel Pacas follows that up with, yes, you can list a PO box address.
1243140	1246900	Technically, VOG network has that type of setup.
1246900	1252020	So if we had registered, we would have been able to use that or whatever, but it doesn't
1252020	1257140	like the fact that, oh, maybe it wouldn't have been as bad for us, does not negate
1257140	1262260	the severity of the crime because like there have been years past.
1262260	1265860	Um, I think with the first E3 was when you and I live together, wasn't it?
1265860	1268340	Loki, the first time we went to E3, you and I were still living together.
1268340	1268900	I think so.
1268900	1268980	Yeah.
1268980	1274900	So I think we put our address on the, the form and on the cards and everything is we
1274900	1276980	didn't like, OLR wasn't registered as a business.
1276980	1278420	Then we weren't with all games.
1278420	1280100	We weren't with a VOG at the time.
1280100	1281780	It was, it was back in the life 365 years.
1283940	1284420	Yeah.
1284740	1289860	Remember later on, I think we, you know, we had other ways to do it, but that first year.
1289860	1290360	Yeah.
1290660	1293140	So, uh, uh, yeah.
1293140	1297380	Pixel pocket says there was a big level of trust from press to the ESA.
1297380	1299220	And now that trust is demolished.
1299220	1303140	I wonder if this is going to cause all media to sign up in person.
1304180	1308340	I don't know if that really would have prevented it, but if media had signed up in person,
1308340	1311300	then they wouldn't have been on a spreadsheet to go out to folks.
1311300	1314180	Well, maybe they would have after the fact, I don't want to speak out of turn,
1314180	1317700	but I would think it's going to cause a lot more people to just work more directly with
1317700	1319620	game companies and not go through the ESA.
1320180	1320580	I don't know.
1322020	1322820	We'll see what happens.
1323460	1327860	Uh, anyway, quest Buster says a lot of streamers also use one to deal with their fans and go
1327860	1330580	to a lot of links to avoid saying anything too personal.
1330580	1334500	But the sheet essentially says exactly who these YouTube and streamers are, who went.
1334500	1334740	Yeah.
1334740	1338500	And it's doing under Matt says, granted, you wouldn't have to use your address, but you'd
1338500	1339540	have to use your real name.
1339540	1341220	I imagine you're right.
1341220	1343540	If I register for a pass, it would have been under my real name.
1343540	1347140	I think y'all know that no parent is cruel enough to name their kid, Rob Roberts.
1347140	1348260	It's a stage name.
1348260	1351620	And you know, I, that, that's, that's who I am on the internet.
1351620	1353060	That's my online identity.
1353060	1355060	When I'm at my day job, I have a different name.
1355060	1358020	I have the one I was born with, so it's, it's different.
1358020	1360660	And it's my right to keep those kinds of two lives separate.
1360660	1361620	And that name is Mr.
1361620	1362020	Rob.
1362020	1362900	That's Mr.
1362900	1363220	Mr.
1363220	1363940	Smoosh's dad.
1363940	1365380	That's my, that's my name.
1365380	1366100	Yeah.
1366100	1370500	So anyway, actually it's funny because funny enough, you say that I do teach classes.
1370580	1374420	I'm a corporate trainer and I do let folks in class call me Mr.
1374420	1375060	Rob.
1375060	1378500	So, cause my real last name gets butchered a lot.
1378500	1379620	That's all I'll say about that.
1379620	1381300	So I let folks call me Mr.
1381300	1381540	Rob.
1382420	1387140	Anyway, very, very, very frustrating news and not the most fun thing to start off the
1387140	1387700	show with.
1387700	1391700	But, uh, you know, we need to hold the ESA accountable for this and I hope next week
1391700	1395060	we have more to say and they have more to say on this whole issue.
1395060	1396420	So let's move on.
1396420	1398820	Let's, let's get into like some happier gaming news.
1398820	1401380	I feel like this whole beginning of the show has been a downer.
1401380	1404900	So let's talk about some happier news, hopefully in your gaming week and some fun
1404900	1406500	games that you've been playing this week.
1406500	1407060	Uh, dark soccer.
1407060	1407620	We'll start with you.
1407620	1408740	How was your gaming week?
1408740	1410340	Other than the phone stuff?
1410340	1417060	I was just playing Sims for, um, really just building houses and feeling crummy.
1418180	1420340	No, no elaborate death traps in the Sims.
1420900	1422900	No, because you can't drown them in.
1422900	1424500	Oh, I just had an idea.
1425380	1432340	What if I build walls around the pool and they can't climb out of the, cause they can
1432340	1434260	climb out of the pool without the ladder now.
1434260	1436340	Oh, that was an upgrade in Sims 4.
1436900	1445700	So what if I put stoves all around the, um, all around the pool.
1446980	1448660	What if I put the stove in the pool?
1448660	1450500	Why can't you just throw a toaster in the pool?
1450500	1451460	Cause that doesn't work.
1451780	1456020	Oh, but I could put stoves around it and then the walls.
1456020	1460420	And so there'd actually be something blocking the edge of the, of the,
1460420	1461700	just lock them in walls.
1461700	1462740	Just wall them in.
1463300	1467220	No, I don't want to have my other Sims live in a house filled with pee.
1467220	1471620	Although I am trying to lock a Sim in there cause I need a ghost in one of my houses I'm
1471620	1472260	designing.
1472260	1475860	Have you, have you thought about just having somebody that's like dead in the walls and
1475860	1479220	then like having a suburban family living in that house where there's like a body?
1479220	1480180	That's what I need to do.
1480180	1480900	Okay.
1480900	1485140	No, but I need this ghost to look a certain way.
1485140	1490900	So I have to design the ghost and then leave the ghost in the wall and then have its body
1490900	1493540	there to haunt the other people in the house.
1493540	1494740	Happy Halloween, everybody.
1495620	1497060	This is Halloween.
1497060	1498340	This is Halloween.
1499140	1499940	All right.
1499940	1501940	Glad to know some things never change with the Sims.
1502580	1503060	All right.
1503060	1504500	Anyway, uh, we'll move on.
1504500	1505860	Loki, how was your gaming week?
1505860	1507460	I didn't really play anything.
1507460	1509620	Um, I did play laser tag again.
1509620	1512500	Um, I did feel more of that actually.
1512500	1514820	And it actually came out decent.
1514820	1516260	Are they starting to recognize you now?
1516820	1518260	Yeah, they should.
1518260	1521700	I mean, um, they're not very organized though.
1521700	1526180	Like I like was asking today about their membership thing and they're like, I don't know.
1526180	1527140	They'll ask the owner.
1527780	1529380	And so the owner was there today.
1529380	1534420	And so I asked him and he's like, he had to like think about it for a sec.
1534420	1537460	And then they pulled out this binder and like, it's like flipping through it.
1537460	1540980	And he's like, I don't know where the pamphlet is, but he's going to email it to me.
1541620	1544340	And I don't even know, like, wow, way to make sales.
1544340	1544660	I know.
1544660	1550740	It's like, it's like, uh, you have, like, if you don't know what the membership thing
1550740	1556660	is about, maybe don't put a page dedicated to it on your fucking website.
1556660	1559140	You know, that's just common sense.
1559140	1563860	I would think like it says, it literally says, come ask us about the membership.
1563860	1566020	So I come ask them every time I'm there.
1566020	1568420	And they're like, I don't fucking know what you're talking about.
1569140	1572500	And so like, I'm just, what the fuck?
1572500	1573540	I don't understand.
1574180	1579060	It's so whatever it is what it is, but I'm just curious.
1579060	1584260	Like, I just like what, cause I know you can like the very least we can get our names logged
1584260	1584500	in.
1584500	1588900	And so instead of using the gun names, because then like, you know, cues are, which use like
1588900	1593380	numbers and colors, um, this, the each gun has like a name to it.
1593380	1597620	So there's actually agent name, there's, there's actually a Loki gun there, but it
1597620	1598100	sucks.
1598100	1598980	So I don't play it.
1599620	1604980	But there's, you know, they have like Thor and racer and like all sorts of weird names,
1604980	1609140	but so if you scan it, can you be Loki, even though there's already a Loki?
1610020	1612180	Um, I'm probably not going to be Loki.
1612180	1614260	I'll just be Loki OLR probably.
1614260	1614500	Okay.
1615220	1618980	You have a different, like, do you have a different gun is your gun personality?
1618980	1620100	You're like gun personality.
1620100	1623300	Is that different from, you know, your, your online video game personality?
1623300	1624500	Maybe you have a different, all the same.
1624500	1624900	Okay.
1624900	1630500	Um, so yeah, I would probably do something like that and I don't know, but like, I like
1630500	1635300	today we did three hours and that's a bit much and I'm, you know, talking with the kids
1635300	1638980	and like, you know, maybe we should just take a break from this next week cause we've been
1638980	1641060	there an awful lot and it's expensive.
1641060	1643540	So, uh, may just kind of cut back on that.
1644100	1651300	Um, I had the good intention of publishing what I had of it's time to car.
1652580	1658820	Unfortunately, when I moved to this laptop, apparently back in 2017, the backups I had
1659460	1663620	were months old from the current one.
1663620	1666260	I'm missing an entire level in it and they're broken.
1666820	1667860	They are missing things.
1667860	1673460	I can restore some of them that have the first three levels in it, but it's just not
1673460	1673860	the same.
1673860	1679540	That last level was just fucking weird in that really kind of encapsulated the whole
1679540	1679940	thing.
1679940	1682580	So I'm probably not going to end up doing that.
1682580	1688500	Although ironically, I've been asked, um, by the owner of the place that we go to for
1688500	1693780	my son's coding class to teach a unity class that is silly.
1693780	1695380	Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
1695380	1696660	Can you say that again?
1696660	1697060	Yes.
1697060	1703300	You, the creator of zero games in unity have now been asked to teach a unity class.
1703700	1704900	She'll okay.
1704900	1708740	Loki's going to be teaching children about a saw.
1708740	1711700	I think he's never really used to completion.
1711700	1713140	Is that, is that, am I understanding this?
1713140	1714420	I've used it enough, but.
1717460	1717860	All right.
1717860	1721540	That's like, that is like me coaching football, but all right, go off.
1724340	1727300	So I I've, I've, I've played Tecmo bowl.
1727300	1729540	I understand the rules of football.
1729540	1730040	Exactly.
1730520	1733080	It's, I don't think it's supposed to be like anything in depth.
1733080	1737720	It's supposed to be just a few classes, not necessarily like this is a full in-depth
1737720	1738840	course of like unity.
1738840	1740840	You're going to learn all about it and everything.
1740840	1745240	It's more of just like, we're going to make a quick game, a project or whatever.
1745240	1745880	And then that's it.
1745880	1746920	Get your feet wet.
1746920	1752040	And because really when they get into unity, it's, it's like several belts later.
1752040	1757800	Like most of the kids are on just like JavaScript and like intermediate JavaScript.
1757800	1763080	And then like to get to unity is probably a couple of years away from them.
1763800	1765880	So it's just going to be like kind of a crash course.
1765880	1768280	And like, here's what you're doing in JavaScript.
1768280	1772280	Here's what C-sharp is, you know, here's how you use unity.
1772280	1778280	We'll set you up with something that, you know, you can build some stuff for like different
1778920	1783800	gameplay aspects and then, you know, run with it and you can rearrange stuff to build your
1783800	1784760	own levels or something.
1784760	1786200	Symbol is the plan.
1786200	1786700	Okay.
1787500	1792780	I, I think that, no, I completely understand your hesitation, which was also my hesitation
1792780	1799420	because it was like, yes, I'm interested, but I haven't really created anything with it.
1799420	1800940	I don't have a lot of formal training.
1800940	1803100	Finally light the fire under your ass to finish.
1803100	1807980	I guess something you can do with your kid, you know, I guess, but yeah, it would be more
1807980	1811020	targeted towards like older kids, like 12 and up type things.
1811020	1814220	So, um, well, your oldest just turned nine, right?
1814220	1815420	Yeah, he's getting there.
1815420	1817980	So it would be happy birthday.
1817980	1818620	Yeah.
1818620	1819980	It'd be interesting.
1819980	1823660	I I'm looking forward to trying that when that's going to happen.
1824780	1825340	All right.
1825340	1831100	But I have to build out a concept for that game in order to be able to teach that.
1831100	1831740	Okay.
1831740	1834780	I have an idea, but I need to like simplify it.
1835820	1836320	All right.
1837100	1837580	All right.
1837580	1839820	Well, if that's it for your gaming week, my gaming week.
1839820	1844460	So, uh, my video game play has still been hampered a little bit because the survivor
1844460	1846300	LARP still going.
1846300	1849900	Guess what everybody I am still in it.
1849900	1853740	And there are six people left after today, starting from 22.
1853740	1854140	Wow.
1854140	1854860	Congratulations.
1854860	1855180	Right.
1855180	1856060	It's crazy.
1856060	1859660	I, and I've, I've collected some votes along the way.
1859660	1865100	There was a huge tribal this week and everybody thought I was leaving.
1865100	1866220	Everybody thought I was leaving.
1866220	1869260	And there was, I have to watch what I say about it because I don't know who's watching,
1869260	1873100	but all I can, so I can really always say what's kind of like publicly known, but basically
1873100	1879340	like there was a big play and somebody else left instead with two immunity idols in his
1879340	1880220	pocket.
1880220	1885900	So it was, yeah, it was a big, how do you leave with immunity idols?
1885900	1890140	Because you have to, so I don't, have you watched survivor like ever or like recently?
1890700	1891020	No.
1891020	1891500	Okay.
1891500	1896620	So they, they thought if you have the immunity idol, you would be immune competitions.
1896620	1898620	You win an immunity necklace and they can't vote for you.
1898620	1902940	But in later seasons of survivor, I think the first one was in Guatemala, the 12th season.
1903340	1908700	What started happening is that they would hide immunity idols basically on the island
1908700	1910540	and you would get clues to these idols.
1910540	1915660	If you find one, you can play it after the votes have been cast, but before they've been
1915660	1916300	read.
1916300	1920540	So if you think that everybody's targeting you, there's goes a chance where Mr. Jeff
1920540	1923580	Probst will go, if anybody has a hidden immunity, I'd only want to play it.
1923580	1924540	Now is the time.
1924540	1927980	And so somebody will pull out the idol and says, well, Jeff, here's this idol that I
1927980	1929100	have in my pocket.
1929100	1931980	And now the votes for me tonight don't count.
1931980	1937500	So if like, let's say everybody on the tribe voted for you and you voted against like Jamie
1937500	1941580	or something, then all the votes against me does not count, does not count.
1941580	1944140	And then the last vote would say, Jamie, Jamie, you've been voted out.
1944140	1944700	You have to go.
1945260	1945820	Bye girl.
1945820	1946300	I'm just kidding.
1947180	1948380	She'd never play survivor.
1948940	1949660	No, I would not.
1950460	1954460	So that, that would be like the, what would you say to show you had been kidnapped?
1954460	1955500	I'm playing survivor.
1957580	1959100	So anyway, so yeah.
1959100	1962300	So he had two of them because he collected them throughout the game and he wasn't the
1962300	1965980	first, there was another girl that was on the other tribe that apparently was voted
1965980	1966860	out with one as well.
1966860	1970300	So like, this is, this has been a big game about blindside and people.
1970300	1975020	So it's been a bit very interesting, but anyway, so without saying too much and watching my
1975020	1976460	mouth, there are six people left.
1977020	1980460	It is going to be done by, so here's the weird thing.
1980460	1985500	The finale is supposed to be a week from tonight, but I told them at the very beginning, I cannot
1985500	1987260	do Sunday nights because I have this show.
1987260	1992940	So if by some miracle of God, I actually am in the final two, they're going to have to
1992940	1994460	move it because of this show.
1994460	1995420	And they already know that.
1995420	1999900	So they're going to have to do it either on Monday or getting voted because yeah, or yeah.
1999900	2001980	And I'm going to, I'm going to lose because I'm not here.
2001980	2002860	So I don't know.
2002860	2003260	We'll see.
2003260	2006460	So everybody cross fingers on your toes, but the good news is if you're sick of hearing
2006460	2011100	me talk about this game, it is over one week from tonight because there's just not enough
2011100	2011740	people left.
2011740	2014940	So, uh, yeah, but it's been going for over 40 days.
2014940	2022140	Anyway, um, Oh, some late breaking news, uh, over in a chat, uh, S2-100 Matt talking about
2022140	2023500	what's happening on Evo.
2023500	2029260	Tekken 7 season three, the trailer was shown for some new characters and S2-100 Matt says
2029260	2034620	Zafina and Leroy Smith, who was an original character are the new characters in Tekken
2034620	2035020	7.
2035020	2036140	So fun.
2036140	2037100	That's pretty cool.
2037100	2040380	I was, I wanted to see if there was any crossover characters that were going to do there.
2040380	2044860	So anyway, uh, other games I have, I have had a little time, you know,
2045020	2048860	the survivor thing, because it's an individual game, like, you know, the competitions are
2048860	2052060	a little different now, so it's not quite as much time that I'm burning.
2052060	2055820	Um, so I have been able to play a little bit of games, but I've been playing mostly final
2055820	2058380	fantasy 14, still working my way through the expansion.
2058380	2061500	I just did the level 77 dungeon last night.
2061500	2064940	And so, um, yeah, still making my way through the expansion, which I still love.
2064940	2069260	Although I will say the quests leading up to that 77 dungeon were probably the lowest
2069260	2069820	point yet.
2069820	2072300	It was a little bit, little bit dry.
2072300	2075980	The story was not as great in that zone, but I expect expecting it will pick back up.
2075980	2077420	And that's certainly not a negative review.
2077420	2080060	I'm still really enjoying the expansion overall.
2080060	2085420	Um, and of course the cell phone games, I did Pokemon go community day yesterday, which,
2085420	2088860	you know, I haven't been able to do the last couple cause they've been on a Sunday.
2089660	2093420	But, uh, yesterday was a hundred degrees Fahrenheit here in SAC.
2093420	2096460	So there was no way I was going to play outside.
2096460	2101900	So we drove to the mall, Arden mall here, and we tried playing in there total bust.
2101900	2107260	Like, yeah, the wifi or the GPS is not like everything in there as a gym and there's not
2107260	2108460	enough spawn points.
2108460	2111500	And the reason why it's bad that they're a gym is that you can't lure them.
2111500	2113820	So it's just, it really wasn't good.
2113820	2115260	The Galleria would be better.
2115260	2115500	Yeah.
2115500	2118540	We should have driven out all the way to the Galleria cause I've done a community day at
2118540	2119820	the Galleria and it was much better.
2119820	2122220	But the GPS doesn't work well in there even.
2122220	2122380	Yeah.
2122380	2123980	We didn't want to drive all the way out there.
2123980	2128380	So, um, we played there for about an hour before we were like, this sucks.
2128380	2132060	And so we got in the car and I just turned on my Bluetooth and let the gotcha do the
2132060	2132700	catching.
2132700	2135500	And we just slowly drove through downtown safely.
2135500	2139260	I didn't do anything risky, but we slowly drove through downtown and we drove around
2139260	2141340	the Capitol in my nice air conditioned car.
2141340	2144860	And we saw a ton of people, like a ton of people were still out, not bothered by the
2144860	2145180	heat.
2145180	2146940	They wanted their shiny routes.
2146940	2148140	So good for them.
2148140	2150460	And I did end the day with four shiny routes.
2150460	2151580	So not, not bad.
2151580	2154380	I still need to trade for my daily goal.
2155100	2155420	Okay.
2155420	2157740	Remind me at some point we'll, uh, we'll do a trade.
2157740	2157980	Okay.
2158380	2158700	Awesome.
2158700	2159340	Awesome.
2159340	2164220	So, um, anyway, uh, and then I played a little bit of the Harry Potter thing cause there's
2164220	2166060	an event going on in that too.
2166060	2169420	And I'm trying to collect the green books, but that's all I'll say about that.
2169420	2172220	So let's get into some more gaming news.
2173660	2175660	I don't think there's anything else for me to say right now.
2175660	2176860	Housekeeping things.
2176860	2182140	Uh, there will be no show labor day weekend and there will be no live show the weekend
2182140	2182940	before.
2182940	2188140	So since we are in August, there's really only going to be three live shows this month.
2188460	2190300	We will be our last live show.
2190300	2194140	This month will be the 17th because I'm sorry, I'm mathing wrong.
2194140	2198780	18th, the 18th, our last live show this month will be the 18th because the 25th, I will
2198780	2200140	already be out of town.
2200140	2203580	I'm leaving for dragon con early this year to go hang out with my buddy extra for, I'm
2203580	2204780	sure y'all can understand.
2204780	2205660	I miss my friends.
2205660	2209020	So I want to go hang out and I've never been to the town where he lives.
2209020	2211660	So next weekend for me is weird Al.
2211660	2212060	Yeah.
2212060	2213740	So you won't be here next week.
2213740	2215740	Um, but cause weird how you will.
2215740	2215900	Yeah.
2215900	2217100	Which is honest.
2217100	2218620	Bobby missed his show for weird house.
2218620	2219820	Now you're missing this one for weird out.
2219820	2220860	So it makes sense.
2220860	2226300	Um, but you will be here on the 18th and then, uh, what we're planning to do, we're going
2226300	2229660	to record earlier in the week for the 25th.
2229660	2232780	Uh, and we'll be doing a lot of listener questions on that episode.
2232780	2235020	So, uh, stay tuned for Twitter and all that.
2235020	2237820	We'll get some stuff out there because we want to, you know, since we won't have as
2237820	2240540	much news cause it'll be partway through the week, we really want to digest some of your
2240540	2243340	questions and answer some of those gaming questions you might have.
2243340	2247500	And September 1st is my 14th anniversary.
2247500	2248620	Mine and Dan's anniversary.
2248620	2249500	Well, congrats.
2249500	2252460	So well, if I don't bring him here, I may not be here.
2252460	2253260	There is no show.
2253260	2253820	Drag on.
2253820	2254540	That's right.
2254540	2254700	Yeah.
2254700	2255660	Dragon cons that weekend.
2255660	2257020	So bring me back something.
2257020	2257900	I will, whatever.
2257900	2258700	Let me know what you want.
2259260	2260060	We'll do that.
2260060	2262460	Um, so yeah, we're going to be not live for two weeks.
2262460	2265980	So sorry to our Twitch crew or sorry to our Twitch crew who shows up.
2265980	2268060	Bobby will be here on the 25th.
2268060	2272620	So you will have something to watch that night cause he is not doing the pre trip.
2272620	2275660	Just the dragon contract, but nothing will be live that week.
2275660	2281660	However, we're exploring what we can do at dragon con.
2281660	2282860	Not going to promise a life thing.
2282860	2287740	I don't think, I don't think that's really in the cards, but could we maybe record something
2287740	2290060	or we'll, we'll, we'll see.
2290060	2290620	We'll see.
2290620	2291580	We're thinking about it.
2291580	2293260	So, uh, stay tuned for that.
2293260	2298860	Um, I think I'm also allowed to say, speaking of dragon con, um, I will be on, I think I'm
2298860	2301820	allowed to say this now, so I'm hoping I'm not speaking out of turn tentatively.
2301820	2304380	I'm on seven panels at dragon con this year.
2304380	2307100	And I'm really, they stream those out the panels.
2307100	2310620	Um, actually, yes, I'm glad you asked the digital media track.
2310620	2314860	So the podcasting track is now the digital media track and they will be streaming all
2314860	2316620	of those panels on Twitch.
2316620	2321100	So even though there's no OLR that weekend, you will get to see myself, uh, six of the
2321100	2325820	panels, but I don't, they're only streaming the ones in room six, not in room seven.
2325820	2326860	Cause there's actually two rooms.
2326860	2327260	Hmm.
2327260	2329660	I think most of my panels are in room six.
2329660	2331500	I was going to say we could auto host that.
2331500	2331980	Oh yeah.
2331980	2332540	Oh, for sure.
2332540	2334940	Vogel Vogel hosts the media track for sure.
2334940	2338940	Um, but we will need to, uh, we'll let you guys know the schedule cause Bobby is on some
2338940	2340620	that I'm not on and vice versa.
2340620	2343100	So there'll be a lot of stuff for you guys to watch from dragon con.
2343100	2345420	So yeah, they will be, they will be streaming some panels that weekend.
2345420	2348700	So at least you can get, get a little fill and get some good topics.
2348700	2350540	So, um, yeah, stay tuned for that.
2350540	2352220	Uh, as 200 Matt says, wow, seven.
2352220	2352460	Yeah.
2352460	2353980	I'm really, really lucky this year.
2353980	2357580	I guess, I guess I'm okay to say, I hope again, I really hope I'm not speaking out of turn.
2357580	2359100	So I'm just gonna say tentatively.
2359100	2362620	Um, the biggest panel I'm going to be doing at dragon con probably this year, cause it's
2362620	2363580	in a ballroom.
2363580	2369020	Uh, I will be, I will be, um, your moderator for the voice actors from world of Warcraft
2369020	2370540	panel at dragon con this year.
2370540	2375580	And I'm really jazzed about it because obviously, wow, is a game near and dear to my heart from
2375580	2377500	hosting horde house for years and years.
2377500	2380140	So, uh, yeah, I'm really excited about that panel.
2380140	2381420	So, uh, stay tuned.
2381420	2384140	I don't, I don't know if that one will be streamed unfortunately, cause that is on a
2384140	2387260	different track that is on the gaming track and I don't think they stream all their panels,
2387260	2388860	but we'll see never say never.
2388940	2391580	So, um, yeah, really excited.
2391580	2392060	Anyway.
2392060	2397180	Um, let's move on and talk about some other gaming news that's going on in the industry.
2397180	2397980	Loki.
2397980	2402620	So the Sony PlayStation four has hit a hundred million units shipped.
2402620	2408780	So it's apparently the, um, it was faster than the PlayStation two and we to hit that
2408780	2409280	amount.
2409820	2416860	And right now, apparently that the switch is reaching 36.8, 7 million tracking in line
2416860	2418060	with the PlayStation four.
2418060	2424220	So it eventually hit a hundred million, probably in around the same time period, but, um,
2424220	2426060	interesting to see how well it's doing.
2426060	2429340	I mean, don't really think about how many units are being sold nowadays.
2429340	2431660	It's kind of like looking at the PlayStation five coming up.
2431660	2432460	Yeah.
2432460	2436940	So, well, but this is just, you know, a lot of us consider like the PlayStation four is
2436940	2438780	like sun setting and it's on its way out.
2438780	2442060	I mean, there might still be a few games that interest us, like death stranding and the
2442060	2443420	seven remake and all that.
2443420	2445980	So I think there's still a lot of interest in PlayStation four, but you're right.
2445980	2449820	Like a lot of us kind of stopped thinking about how much that sells because most of
2449820	2454700	the gaming enthusiasts such as us and many, many of you guys, but not all you guys have
2454700	2461100	probably already picked up a PlayStation four, but we all know that budget gamers, gamers
2461100	2465660	that, you know, can't necessarily drop hundreds of dollars on a console looking for things,
2465660	2467740	you know, to come down in price and so forth.
2467740	2472700	Like this is the time in the gaming generation where I think some people finally get on board
2472700	2476940	because there's such a rich library of cheap games that have been out for a few years.
2476940	2480940	And the price of the PlayStation fours are coming down and down and down, you know, as
2481580	2485820	you know, as the gaming enthusiasts who tend to buy the new technology are starting to
2485820	2487660	shift their focus towards the PlayStation five.
2487660	2489900	So there's definitely an audience still for PlayStation four.
2489900	2490540	Absolutely.
2490540	2490780	Yeah.
2490780	2493900	There will continue to be, you know, I'm sure there's people.
2493900	2497660	In fact, I thought I knew somebody recently that said they had recently bought an Xbox
2497660	2503660	360 at a game, like a used gaming outfit, like a flea market, you know, that type of
2503660	2505260	thing buying Xbox 360.
2505260	2509180	And I was like, cool, there's tons of Xbox 360 games out there waiting for you to play.
2509180	2510940	Like, there's a great library of games on there.
2510940	2513660	You can have a good time and, you know, the secondhand market for games.
2513660	2516460	And if you want to get dirt cheap, there's dirt cheap.
2516460	2517340	There's a lot to buy.
2517340	2518460	So heck yeah.
2518460	2523900	Like, you know, and I really believe even if you have to come late to the party because
2523900	2526300	of financial situations or whatever, you're still a gamer.
2527020	2528620	Like what makes you a gamer?
2528620	2530860	Criteria one loves to play video games.
2530860	2531660	End of list.
2531660	2532140	Right.
2532140	2534700	So, you know, if you're late to the party, you're still a gamer to me.
2534700	2539100	So, uh, yeah, I think that's, that's cool that some people will still be able to get
2539100	2540940	on onboard with PlayStation four.
2540940	2543980	But yes, I'm sure a lot of us are now shifting focus to PlayStation five.
2543980	2548140	Do we know kind of like comparatively, like where's Xbox one at compared to this 100
2548140	2549260	million number for PlayStation four?
2549260	2551100	Um, good question.
2551100	2555020	So while you look that up, we have more breaking news coming out of evil.
2555020	2555900	Really small.
2556860	2563020	Actually, funny enough, the Xbox one is not listed on this because they're not out in
2563020	2563900	Japan.
2563900	2568540	That could be, uh, no, this is, this is from like an analyst that they have, like it charted
2568540	2568780	out.
2568780	2569820	Let me correct myself.
2569820	2571260	Xbox one is out in Japan.
2571260	2575500	We just all know it's a non-issue, but yeah, the Xbox one is not shown here.
2575500	2577980	The 360 show on here, but not Xbox one.
2577980	2578700	Interesting.
2578700	2579020	All right.
2580140	2584620	Um, so, uh, breaking news more out of Evo because they're showing a lot of trailers
2584620	2586060	as things are wrapping up for the night.
2586060	2592300	Uh, ARC system arc system just showed a trailer for a new guilty gear game coming in 2020.
2593260	2594380	So that'll be exciting.
2594380	2596220	And a lot of fans of guilty gear.
2596220	2598860	And maybe that's something we'll see played at next year's Evo.
2598860	2599900	We'll see about that.
2599900	2602780	Uh, SEO 100 Matt saying that he's looking at the animation style.
2602780	2603500	Looks good.
2603500	2607420	It's a combination of 2d hand-drawn and like the 3d street fighter five stuff.
2607420	2608300	Sounds cool.
2608300	2609020	Looking forward to it.
2609740	2610460	All right.
2610460	2614220	So let's move on with some more news and talk a little bit about, Hey, speaking of like
2614220	2617260	streaming and Twitch and stuff like that, this is pretty big news.
2617260	2622380	Now I don't watch this guy personally, just because I prefer to watch friends and acquaintances
2622380	2624940	and Twitter peeps and all that do streaming.
2624940	2627500	But I know this guy does have a lot of people that watched him.
2627500	2632540	And so this is going to be some, some big, interesting results from this.
2632540	2637260	And it is Ninja real name, Tyler Blevins, uh, which is not me doxing him.
2637260	2639100	That's a well-known fact that that's his name.
2639980	2648620	So Ninja has made a deal to leave Twitch and made a whole video, uh, that was on his Twitter
2648620	2655180	and stuff, uh, that he will now be exclusive on mixer, which is the Twitch competitor of
2655180	2657820	sorts that is owned by Microsoft.
2657820	2662860	And I think they have been trying very hard to leave a footprint of sorts in the streaming
2662860	2663260	universe.
2664140	2669340	I know that mixer is the place to kind of watch the Xbox press conferences and so forth.
2669340	2671660	And you get your little mix pots and you do that and all that.
2672460	2673900	But this is a pretty big deal.
2673900	2677980	It's a big deal because, you know, we say it's, Oh, it's just one person leaving for
2677980	2680620	mixer, but love him or hate him.
2680620	2682780	Ninja has a gigantic audience.
2682780	2685900	He is one of the largest streamers on Twitch right now.
2686460	2689660	Well now on mixer as this announcement, but you know what I mean?
2690060	2694780	And I think that's important because like, I know I saw a YouTube clip where this guy
2694780	2699580	was on the Ellen show and he was like the face of the streaming community.
2699580	2700140	Right.
2700140	2700380	Yeah.
2700380	2704860	And now when he goes on to these big talk shows and he, what he puts on his own fucking
2704860	2706380	Fortnite thing, right.
2706380	2708780	He had his own like a festival or things like that.
2708780	2709100	Right.
2709100	2709340	Yeah.
2709340	2713260	And he was also, was that the new year's thing that they had that they were like advertising
2713260	2713820	and stuff.
2713820	2717980	This guy's big enough to have his own fucking festival, but now he's going to be pimping
2717980	2718540	mixer.
2719420	2724860	You know, and I'm sure Microsoft paid him a pretty penny to do it, but well, let me
2724860	2725740	ask this question first.
2725740	2727900	I'll ask of chat and ask of you guys.
2727900	2732380	Do you, I mean, we don't know how much, cause that's all in secret, but do you think Microsoft
2732380	2737740	made a good move by assumably paying him a hefty sum of money to move to mixer?
2737740	2737980	Yeah.
2738700	2739340	Yeah.
2739340	2739740	Kind of.
2740380	2740860	Yeah.
2740860	2743260	I think it's a, I think it's a smart move.
2743260	2747660	It's, I don't want to call it a desperate move, but it's definitely a move where you
2747660	2751420	see Microsoft is like, we have to do something big.
2752060	2756460	And so this is, you also kind of have to wonder, is there anybody else?
2757100	2759340	Is Microsoft looking at anybody else?
2759340	2761420	And let me just shut those rumors down right now.
2761420	2761980	It's not us.
2761980	2765020	No one's looking at us.
2765020	2768780	Come on, we'll pay you one dollar.
2768780	2769900	I like money though.
2769900	2772300	Well, you do have a very attractive offer.
2772300	2778540	But, uh, no, we're, we're doing, we're doing more than okay right here on Twitch.
2778540	2782860	Thanks to your, uh, subscriptions on Twitch prime and thanks to all your, uh, biddies
2782860	2786060	and things like that where we're not, I'm just making a joke where it's not something
2786060	2791020	we're looking at right now, but it's interesting because even though I do love Twitch and support
2791020	2795340	Twitch and I stream on Twitch, even as a personal person and as well as VOG network, then it
2795340	2796620	puts some effort in this.
2796620	2802220	I can still say this is really exciting news from my perspective, because I think a little
2802220	2807500	bit of competition and a little bit of like challenging Twitch's dominance is a good thing
2807500	2811740	because it's going to motivate Twitch to maybe do some other things to, you know, a little
2811740	2816940	bit faster, like the co-streaming thing, which I think is still only partners only.
2816940	2821500	Uh, I think a lot of us would really love to see that open up where it's, you know,
2821500	2823260	more people can do those types of streams.
2823260	2828700	I mean, hello, when Mario maker finally allows you to do those, uh, player levels online,
2828700	2831100	I would love to co-stream with people on that.
2831100	2834460	You know, let my buddies like VG realness and stuff, or Bobby black hole for something.
2834460	2836220	I think we'd have a lot of fun with things like that.
2836220	2839340	So, you know, if I wanted to do it on mixer, I could do it right now.
2839340	2842700	So that is the thing that, you know, Twitch doesn't have yet.
2842700	2844700	It has it for partners again, reiterating.
2844700	2847580	So, and I know they're planning to open it up to more, but I think this might maybe light
2847580	2851580	the fire a little bit to try to push some of those features out, maybe a little faster.
2851580	2852460	I don't know.
2852460	2854860	Let's go to you guys in chat with some comments.
2854860	2859340	Um, Questbuster says Microsoft needs all the help it can get to boost mixer.
2859420	2864620	Um, tiger class as Ninja will provide a lot of exposure for a lot of Microsoft's own games.
2864620	2868060	You know, he'll get access to those exclusives before anyone else.
2868060	2868940	Very good thought.
2868940	2875100	I mean, Ninja is mostly known as a Fortnite guy, but Microsoft is invested in pub G aren't
2875100	2875740	they?
2875740	2878140	I don't remember if they are, they invested.
2878140	2880940	It just seems like a lot of pub G stuff happens on Microsoft stuff.
2881500	2884460	So would Ninja be playing some of these other games?
2884460	2885340	Possibly.
2885340	2886940	I wonder if that would be a thing.
2886940	2891980	Um, tiger class says Ninja is mostly known for playing Fortnite, but no doubt he'll play
2891980	2892940	the new halo game.
2892940	2893500	Oh, I'm sure.
2894140	2899500	Questbuster says he debuted on mixer with somewhere between 60 to 70,000 people watching.
2899500	2901740	If I recall correctly, that's a pretty big deal.
2902460	2906540	Uh, and SJ 100, Matt says also competition brings about innovation.
2906540	2908620	Maybe this will push Twitch to innovate.
2908620	2910940	And I don't think it's that like Twitch hasn't innovated.
2910940	2913820	Like if I wasn't happy with Twitch, I wouldn't be here right now.
2913820	2917980	But, um, you know, I, I liked this idea that it's maybe going to push it a little, it's
2917980	2922700	going to needle them a little more and a little faster to, uh, respond to some of those things
2922700	2925260	that mixer maybe has on them right now.
2925260	2930220	So, uh, Questbuster, uh, responding to the halo thing says, interestingly, halo is where
2930220	2933420	Ninja cut his FPS teeth before his Fortnite fame.
2933420	2935020	Oh, very interesting.
2935020	2940940	So anyway, and bonds 006 says I'm waiting for OLRs new address to be one Microsoft way
2940940	2942620	in Redmond, Washington.
2942620	2947100	No, I don't, again, I don't really see that happening anytime soon, but, uh, they bless
2947100	2949660	your heart for thinking we have that kind of pull.
2950940	2954460	So anyway, um, yeah, very, we'll, we'll see what develops with this.
2954460	2957740	I want to, I'm, I'm so curious to see what Twitch does.
2957740	2963100	I would see maybe something where it would make a lot of sense where either Twitch and
2963100	2968540	Sony or Twitch and Nintendo are going to form some type of ally ship.
2969500	2973740	I mean, granted Sony and Nintendo both broadcast, you know, their things on Twitch.
2973740	2976300	Actually, I feel like Nintendo has always been a little more YouTube.
2976300	2980300	They kind of linked their YouTube directs, uh, directly and all that stuff, but Nintendo
2980300	2981740	certainly done the press conferences and things.
2981740	2983740	So maybe there'll be some type of ally ship with Sony.
2983740	2984140	Who knows?
2984140	2988540	I mean, I I'm just, you know, if mixer is a Microsoft thing, maybe it would behoove
2988540	2993900	Twitch to form a, you know, um, agreement, a working agreement or whatever you want to
2993900	2998140	call it with Sony to try to see what they can explore together and do.
2998300	3004220	So, Oh, anyway, uh, metal mayhem says in fairness, if Ninja's audience is mostly kids like
3004220	3007980	Fortnite, if Ninja plays other games, is his audience going to give a shit?
3008540	3012140	Um, I think, yeah, there would be enough, right?
3012140	3018060	Even if, even if he got 10% of that viewership he had for his first stream, I mean, I'm
3018060	3019820	sure he would bring in a lot for some people.
3019820	3020140	Yeah.
3020140	3024220	Because there's a lot of kids that will emulate what they see on YouTube.
3024220	3027980	Like if some YouTuber is doing something they'll want to do, you know, this
3028860	3030140	I do know this firsthand.
3030140	3034140	So, um, yeah, I mean, to a certain extent, yes.
3034140	3036700	You may have some people that are like, no, I'm not going to do that.
3036700	3043180	But if there's a streamer having fun with a game and you know, they watch him and see
3043180	3046860	that he's having fun with the game, then there might be more inclined to try that game.
3047420	3050540	Which I mean, that kind of goes with a lot of people that I watch.
3050540	3054300	So yeah, I could totally see that being a thing.
3054300	3055740	It's only going to be positive.
3056620	3060380	Um, just to put some things in perspective, some things, uh, from these nudist articles
3060380	3065980	I wanted to share, uh, according to Streamlabs data, cause Streamlabs kind of watches, you
3065980	3070060	know, a lot of what's going on and Streamlabs is the way how, like, if you do a host or
3070060	3073340	you donate bits, the little ticker on the bottom of the screen will update for those
3073340	3075340	of you watching on Twitch will ticker updates with that.
3075340	3077900	So that way we don't have to stop our show to keep calling out.
3077900	3079500	We do that at the end instead.
3079500	3081020	Um, so Streamlabs is from that.
3081020	3082540	So I know they watch a lot of feeds.
3082860	3089180	But Streamlabs says Twitch was watched nearly 23 times as much as Mixer in the second quarter
3089180	3090300	of 2019.
3090300	3092380	That's pretty big, 23 times as much.
3093100	3095980	Now Twitch did put out a statement, right?
3095980	3096940	They have to respond to this.
3096940	3099100	And they said, they said something very tactful.
3099100	3103580	They said, we've loved watching Ninja on Twitch over the years and are proud of all that he's
3103580	3106700	accomplished for himself and his family and the gaming community.
3106700	3109500	We wish him the best of luck in his future endeavors.
3109500	3111980	And then they promptly pulled his verified check mark.
3112780	3113580	Which is true.
3113580	3116540	He no longer has the little verified check mark on his channel.
3116540	3118220	They, they pulled that same day.
3118780	3126060	So, uh, interesting, but I mean, it might look like a Dick thing to do, but like business
3126060	3127340	is business, right?
3127340	3131500	You know, that he, he basically flew the coop.
3131500	3133660	That's how they deleted his channel though.
3133660	3135580	No, you don't want to delete the channel.
3135580	3138940	That's a little much, but, um, you know, that's, that's it.
3138940	3142060	He's not going to be pushed in search results or anything like that anymore.
3142860	3143180	Sure.
3143740	3145980	So, uh, that's funny.
3145980	3149180	Nifty in chat says Twitch is a classy ex.
3150780	3152780	I like that Twitch is a classy ex.
3152780	3153820	All right, let's move on.
3153820	3155020	Let's move on to our next story.
3155020	3156140	Dark Sakura, what do you have for us?
3157420	3163500	Well, just when we thought SNK couldn't do anything else cryptic, they did.
3164380	3174700	Um, SNK global put out a, um, a tweet and it says a next gen Neo Geo hardware is coming
3174700	3179500	after Neo Geo mini with a modern design and a wonderful play feeling.
3179500	3181900	And you can even link it to Neo Geo mini.
3181900	3185580	The new hardware will provide you a Neo Geo journey that you have never experienced.
3185580	3190380	I think this might be a translation, but who knows what the hell this is.
3190380	3193260	They haven't really said anything other than teasing.
3193260	3195660	But something compatible with Neo Geo mini.
3198540	3198940	Weird.
3200300	3201980	They just did this all they had to say.
3201980	3203900	So this is really just speculation.
3204700	3207660	Um, I mean, the thing that's a little bit more interesting to me is that
3208220	3211820	they are specifically stating it will work with the Neo Geo mini.
3211820	3215580	So maybe this is just a little bit more to try to get people to buy it.
3216140	3219900	Maybe it's like some type of like expansion pack with new games.
3219900	3221660	Maybe something that like plugs in, I don't know.
3221660	3223180	I'm reaching, but maybe something.
3225420	3227980	Maybe, or maybe something that would allow them.
3227980	3232380	Maybe they have a repository of games that, Oh, maybe it would be something
3232380	3235100	that they could sell other games piecemeal or something.
3235100	3237020	Gen, I guess that's true.
3237020	3237340	Huh?
3237340	3237820	I don't know.
3238380	3242860	Unless they're referring to next gen for Neo Geo software, which would be the Neo
3242860	3246460	Geo 64 stuff or whatever the fuck it was called.
3246460	3249340	Are you suggesting a Neo Neo Geo?
3251660	3259340	Yeah, it's Neo Geo.
3259340	3259740	I don't know.
3259740	3262780	What would you, you're you're you've played more Neo Geo than probably anybody
3262780	3263260	else here.
3263260	3264860	Cause you actually own one.
3264860	3266780	So what, what would you like to see them do?
3266780	3269500	Do you think, do you think that's in case you get back into the hardware?
3270700	3275340	I want the be all end all AVS cartridge.
3275900	3279740	I want them to release that as a special thing for everyone who still owns an AVS.
3280620	3284220	What about like, speaking of arcade machines, Hey, those arcade one up things
3284220	3285340	are all the rage, right?
3285340	3290300	What about like a cabinet or something for like Neo Geo games, like a little mini
3290300	3293580	cabinet, like those arcade one ups for your Neo Geo games, that would be pretty
3293580	3293900	awesome.
3294460	3297580	Yeah, but I've played one of those arcade one ups and they're kind of hard.
3298620	3302860	They should totally do that in this, have it set up like the AVS four systems
3302860	3307020	where you get, you can buy the individual cartridges and plop them in and be able
3307020	3308140	to switch through them.
3308140	3309820	And I hope the cartridges still cost $400.
3311980	3312940	Why you gotta ruin everything?
3313820	3314380	Sorry.
3314380	3317100	Can't, can't resist those cards for those of you guys.
3317100	3320780	And you know, some of you I know weren't really, you know, around or in the video
3320780	3326060	game scene when Neo Geo is the thing, but seriously look at how gigantic those Neo
3326060	3327100	Geo cartridges were.
3327100	3329500	Like they were like the size of a shoebox.
3329500	3331500	Like a VHS cassette or something.
3331500	3331740	Yeah.
3332860	3333100	Okay.
3333100	3334860	That's a good way to put like an entire VHS.
3334860	3341820	Actually, it's a little, if you held the cartridge up at full height and turn to
3341820	3346860	VHS cassette on, on its horizontal edge, it would be just about as long, but
3346860	3350620	probably another half as tall, if that makes sense.
3350620	3350780	Yeah.
3351420	3355420	And we've got a few, I mean, the one that we paid probably the last one Dan and I
3355420	3361500	bought was KOF 2000 and we paid $325 for the cartridge.
3361500	3364940	And that was actually a steal when that one came out.
3364940	3367100	It was actually one of the lowest priced ones.
3368380	3369100	Actually, I take that back.
3369100	3374540	We paid $295 for it and that's how we got it because it was originally $375, but
3374540	3378540	we've, we've got a, we've got like, I wouldn't say a handful cause one is a
3378540	3383260	handful, maybe two, but we've got like a shelf full.
3383260	3388380	I used to have a 48 in one bootleg card that I got with my arcade machine, my
3388380	3389660	Astra city when I bought it.
3390540	3393020	Cause I had an MVS for that as well.
3393020	3397100	But, um, I gave it to Bobby, want to give him the super gun.
3398060	3399100	So I don't have it anymore.
3400540	3400860	All right.
3401580	3402300	Well, let's move on.
3402300	3405740	We have some more stories for you guys before we get to our walk down memory
3405740	3408860	lane in our classic segment for this week.
3408860	3410460	But first Loki.
3410460	3416460	So apparently somebody has taken the trouble to go ahead and port Diablo to,
3416460	3420780	um, the web, so you can actually play it in a web browser.
3420780	3425420	So this is done thanks to the, uh, devolution team.
3425420	3426140	I love that name.
3426700	3431500	Um, so they actually have a GitHub that's talking about it where they basically
3431500	3436140	ported over everything, including all of the glitches and bugs that were in it
3436140	3436540	before.
3437260	3440780	If you're interested in checking it out, you can actually play it at
3440780	3443500	diablo.rivesoft.net.
3444220	3447740	Um, it does require that you actually have a copy of the game if you want to
3447740	3448620	play the full game.
3448620	3454860	So you actually have to find your, uh, dhabdet.mpq file to drag into the
3454860	3458540	browser windows so they can verify you have it, or you can buy it on GOG for
3458540	3459100	10 bucks.
3459980	3463180	Or they do have the shareware version available that you can play as well.
3463180	3466700	And you can download that, but it's all playable within the browser.
3467580	3468460	Pretty cool.
3468460	3468700	Huh?
3469340	3470380	Good way to kill time.
3470380	3470700	Yeah.
3470700	3472940	But you have to have that original file still.
3472940	3477180	I'm sure it's not floating around on the internet on some, uh, uh, you know,
3477180	3478700	dark website out there somewhere.
3478700	3479340	It's only 10 bucks.
3479340	3479660	Yeah.
3479660	3483660	I think that's probably their way of like being like, well, we're not really
3483660	3485260	letting you know, giving the game away.
3485260	3488380	You still have to prove you on the game, but you know, wink, wink, right?
3489100	3493020	So yeah, I will say though, if you've been playing like Diablo three or even
3493020	3498380	Diablo two, going back to the original Diablo is not easy because I did, I
3498380	3501900	bought the original Diablo when it came out recently.
3501900	3505420	Um, and, uh, like for $10 and you know, it's fun.
3505420	3508620	I like playing it as a piece of gaming history and all that, but it's
3508620	3510220	Was that the remaster that they did?
3510220	3513420	Or yeah, that, that minor remaster they did, it's not really remastered.
3513420	3515020	It's just like, it runs in better resolution.
3515020	3516620	We polished some of the sprites up.
3516620	3517660	I wouldn't even say they did that.
3517660	3519100	We polished the resolution.
3519660	3522220	No, they, they, we re-released it.
3522220	3522940	No, Loki.
3522940	3525580	They let it run in a larger window than it used to run in.
3525580	3526860	That's pretty much what it was.
3526860	3527500	Yeah.
3527500	3531180	So, uh, it's still, it still looks as blocky as ever, but I mean, it's, don't
3531180	3534460	get me wrong, it's still fun, but it's just, you know, it is a game that shows
3534460	3538380	its age a little more, uh, compared to something like Diablo three that has a
3538380	3540860	lot of the quality of life improvements and so forth.
3540860	3543980	So, uh, metal mayhem says, why would you play it on the web when you
3543980	3545100	already have it on your PC?
3545660	3549980	Because why, why do people install Linux on their refrigerators?
3549980	3551340	Because they can, right.
3552300	3553980	That's why they do it anyway.
3554540	3554860	All right.
3554860	3555340	Moving on.
3556220	3559580	Uh, this is kind of an interesting, uh, new thing that Nintendo is doing.
3559580	3562060	It's like, it's like they're stepping into the modern era when it comes to
3562060	3562940	online a little bit.
3563740	3567260	Nintendo has announced they are testing out game trials.
3567260	3571820	It will allow you to play a full price game for free for a few days.
3571820	3575660	If you have the Nintendo online program.
3575660	3580060	So the first game that was announced for this is Mario Tennis Aces.
3580060	3583660	It will be running from the 7th of August through the 13th of August.
3583660	3586700	And if you liked what you played, you can go right on over to the eShop and
3586700	3589500	get a 33% discount to buy the full game.
3589500	3593340	Again, that's all only available if you have the Nintendo switch online membership.
3593340	3596620	Um, this is something that Microsoft's done like free weekends.
3596620	3597180	Right.
3597180	3598860	And steam does this too.
3598860	3601660	So it's just Nintendo is kind of joining in on this as well.
3601660	3605340	Uh, I want to say, I felt like they did this once with Splatoon.
3606460	3608140	I don't even know if it was the beta.
3608140	3612220	I feel like they did like a thing mid, mid Splatoon 2, or maybe it was the first one
3612220	3614060	where you could kind of play it for free one weekend.
3614060	3615660	And then it was like, Hey, you can buy it.
3615660	3618140	But now it seems like Nintendo is going to make this a regular thing.
3618140	3621180	But again, if you have the switch online,
3621180	3624300	Are they going to limit the number of plays like they did with their demos?
3624300	3625980	Because that was fucking dumb.
3625980	3626460	I don't.
3626460	3627660	It's not in the statement.
3627660	3632940	I mean, I guess we don't really know until it's out, but I do think that was a 3DS thing.
3632940	3635580	And the switch doesn't really load the software the same way.
3635580	3637340	They did it with the Wii U as well.
3637340	3637980	Did they?
3637980	3638460	Yeah.
3638460	3638860	You're right.
3638860	3639340	They did.
3639340	3639820	They did.
3639820	3641180	It's a stupid thing.
3641180	3641740	Yeah.
3641740	3642700	Well, maybe they will.
3642700	3643100	I don't know.
3643660	3646540	But I mean, even with 25 plays, that's a lot of plays.
3646540	3646860	I know.
3646860	3648620	But it's fucking dumb.
3648620	3648860	Yeah.
3650540	3650860	Dr.
3650860	3653340	Sia says, Yeah, I think that was the Splatoon demo.
3653340	3655020	I know they did that for Splatoon 2.
3655020	3655340	Dr.
3655340	3659500	Sia says in Japan, I believe they get Captain Toad for their program.
3659500	3659980	Yeah.
3659980	3664220	I should point out this story that I just read is from a Nintendo UK update.
3664220	3667500	But I think I heard it was going to be in the US as well.
3667500	3668860	So keep an eye out.
3668860	3673980	I'm sure Nintendo will post confirmation on the Nintendo US Twitter next week if that's
3673980	3675180	the direction they're going in.
3675180	3679020	But it's still worth noting that they are doing this, even if they don't do it in North
3679020	3682300	America right away, that they're doing it in other places.
3682300	3683820	So we'll see.
3683820	3685820	Stay tuned, I imagine, on Monday.
3685820	3687900	Or maybe it is a test that they're not doing here yet.
3687900	3689660	They want to see how it does in Europe and Japan first.
3689660	3690380	Who knows?
3690380	3693260	But I think it's still noteworthy to note that they're going in that direction.
3693260	3695660	So all right, let's move on.
3695660	3697740	Dark Sakura has more on Nintendo, right?
3697740	3698380	I do.
3699260	3707500	So Nintendo is going to be holding a game expo in Kyoto.
3707500	3710860	And it will be Nintendo Live 2019 Kyoto.
3710860	3712460	How's that for an apt name?
3714060	3716540	Last year's, of course, was in Tokyo.
3716540	3717660	And guess what was?
3718220	3719340	It was in Tokyo.
3719340	3720140	Just saying.
3720140	3724140	But at any rate, they're going to have game tournaments, events, demos.
3725020	3726780	They are among the stage events.
3726780	3732460	They're going to do a Splatoon music show and a Super Mario Maker 2 stage show with
3734620	3736700	a comedy duo called Yoiko.
3739180	3745260	And there's going to be tournaments in Super Smash Brothers Ultimate, Splatoon 2, Super
3745260	3746220	Mario Maker 2.
3746860	3752380	And there will be winners of a Labo contest that will be on display.
3752380	3757580	They didn't say what the demos are going to be yet, but we'll see what happens.
3757580	3758940	But yeah, Nintendo does their own thing.
3758940	3760620	They're like, screw Tokyo Game Show.
3760620	3761020	Fuck it.
3762460	3763660	We're doing our own thing.
3763660	3765580	But they haven't always done their own thing.
3765580	3765900	No.
3765900	3769020	They had, what, Nintendo Universe one year or something like that, but they don't always
3769020	3769260	do it.
3769260	3772780	So it is interesting that they're doing it this year for whatever reasons.
3772780	3773420	Yeah.
3773420	3777900	But at any rate, it will be October 13th and 14th at the Kyoto International Conference
3777900	3778140	Center.
3779020	3784780	I would imagine that it's probably going to be the first playable Animal Crossing.
3784780	3785900	Oh God, I hope so.
3785900	3786780	Will probably be that.
3786780	3789820	Because that's only going to be what, like five months away from the release of Animal
3789820	3790620	Crossing?
3790620	3791820	I want it now.
3791820	3796780	I know you do, but you know, you can go to Japan and play it early, maybe.
3796780	3797820	Pay for my ticket.
3797820	3798140	Yeah.
3798140	3798700	Oh, I'm sorry.
3798700	3800620	Dark Tetsuya says, what was Space World?
3800620	3802220	I'm sorry, it was Space World.
3802220	3803420	I don't know what Nintendo Universe was.
3803420	3803900	I made that up.
3803900	3805420	But Space World was the thing I was thinking of.
3805420	3807020	But Nintendo Universe does sound pretty cool.
3807020	3807900	It does sound pretty cool.
3808940	3809980	Should be their new console.
3809980	3810380	I don't know.
3810380	3811020	Patent pending.
3811820	3812140	Anyway.
3813180	3815020	So yeah, we'll see.
3815020	3817500	Does Nintendo have something else next March?
3817500	3819500	Because Pokemon will almost be out.
3819500	3822620	So maybe they'll probably have some playable Pokemon stuff too, for sure.
3822620	3824540	Because they're going to be pushing Sword and Shield.
3824540	3827420	Did Nintendo date anything else for March next year?
3827420	3829020	I feel like everybody was dating.
3829020	3832300	Well, Animal Crossing becoming out shortly after that.
3832300	3833980	No, Animal Crossing is March.
3833980	3835180	Oh, is that March?
3835180	3835740	Yeah.
3835740	3836300	Oh, okay.
3836300	3838540	No, it's Pokemon that's out shortly after that.
3838540	3841660	So Pokemon would seem like, sureably, it's part of the event as well.
3842620	3844700	I mean, they might unveil something new.
3844700	3845980	There might be a surprise.
3845980	3848140	I mean, it's Pikmin 5.
3848140	3848620	Who knows?
3848620	3851260	It's Luigi's Mansion 4.
3851980	3854060	Let's make more sequels for those games.
3854060	3857500	Quest Buster also points out that Nintendo is also going to be a Gamescom.
3857500	3861420	That's not terribly surprising, but I imagine they're going to bring a similar setup to
3861420	3865340	what they had at E3 and what's been traveling around the country with the Nintendo.
3865900	3868300	You know, experience that they were that they had at the State Fair,
3868300	3869980	which I missed out on and all that other stuff.
3869980	3870380	Yeah.
3870380	3871100	Yeah.
3871100	3871740	So we'll see.
3872300	3875500	I would have gone to the State Fair, but I ended up being out of town for the last week.
3875500	3875820	Yeah.
3875820	3876860	With that surprise trip.
3876860	3878700	So anyway, all right.
3879580	3880540	Moving on, Loki.
3881180	3888780	So there's some more Labo VR support now for Captain Toad Treasure Tracker.
3888780	3893340	So apparently with the version 1.3.0 update,
3893900	3898380	you're able to actually play a version of the game that is compatible with that.
3898380	3905100	So you have the seroscopic 3D and you can rotate around the different levels in a 360 degree view.
3906540	3907020	I don't know.
3910780	3912540	It's cool that they added that.
3912540	3913500	They didn't have to do that.
3913500	3916060	But this is not going to catch on.
3916060	3916860	It really isn't.
3916860	3921180	The Mario Odyssey stuff was kind of OK.
3921820	3922700	It wasn't very good.
3923900	3926540	I haven't tried the Legends, all this stuff.
3926540	3928540	But I hear that's not good.
3928540	3930780	And I can't imagine that this is going to be that great.
3931740	3933420	The games themselves are all right.
3933420	3936140	The Labo VR stuff.
3936140	3937980	But I don't know.
3937980	3943260	That Labo stuff just kind of gets boring pretty fast, unfortunately.
3944380	3944700	Yeah.
3944700	3948460	I mean, I guess it's cool that they went back and they patched in the support to try to like,
3948460	3952780	you know, I like it when Nintendo tries to bring more value to their old games.
3952780	3955980	And, you know, titles that have been out a little bit with like a surprise patch or something.
3955980	3957740	But is this really added value?
3958460	3959820	Because it didn't end up that way in the end.
3959820	3963820	Well, I'm assuming that this stuff is probably not flying off store shelves anymore.
3964460	3970540	If you can find a version of Labo, like if you want to check it out, the VR stuff,
3970540	3975820	I'd recommend getting just that 40 dollar one with the like blaster gun thing.
3975820	3978860	That was actually probably one of the more fun games that they had in there.
3979340	3983260	Um, that'd probably be worth your money if you can get it cheaper than 40 bucks,
3983260	3985420	which I think is what the retail is on it now.
3986220	3989980	Maybe when it drops down to 20 might not be a bad deal.
3989980	3994700	But yeah, don't definitely don't buy it for Captain Toad's Treasure Tracker.
3995820	3999580	No, I did finally see one of those things on the shelf the other day, though,
3999580	4001020	because, you know, they were hard to get for a while.
4001020	4003260	But now they're they seem to be a little more available.
4003260	4003580	Yeah.
4003580	4004460	So, yeah.
4004460	4005180	All right.
4005180	4006140	Well, let's move on.
4006220	4010940	And something that is not going to be available much longer is the YouTube app on the 3DS.
4011500	4015660	It will be closing on September 3rd, 2019.
4015660	4019180	So if you are still using your 3DS for YouTube, which, you know,
4019180	4022780	I can't imagine there's a lot of people, but I could I could see like maybe like kids,
4022780	4024860	you know, your kids if they didn't have a tablet.
4024860	4025980	But yeah, OK.
4025980	4028060	But they but they have another device that they can use.
4028060	4028380	Yeah.
4028380	4030540	And I guess a lot of folks probably do in that situation.
4031180	4035020	So Nintendo did confirm that YouTube will no longer be available to download or
4035020	4037260	function after September 3rd.
4037260	4040380	And apparently the app has been having issues for a while anyway,
4041100	4044460	as I'm sure YouTube has been doing their own upgrades and things behind the scenes.
4045100	4050460	Maintaining the 3DS and as a platform is probably not their highest priority,
4051260	4055180	as dark Tetsuya puts it in our chat at Twitch TV slash VOG Network.
4055180	4059340	If you needed any more proof that the 3DS is on the way out, you're looking at it.
4059340	4059660	Yep.
4059660	4061180	It's another kind of nail in the coffin.
4061180	4061660	Right.
4061660	4067660	So see a YouTube app is available on the switch, which I imagine a lot of people are,
4067660	4071660	you know, they're nudging them to upgrade to, especially with the switch light soon on the way.
4071660	4074300	I think Nintendo would just love it if you replace
4074300	4078380	your 3DS with one of those devices, if you must have YouTube.
4078380	4080460	But like you said, a lot of people have a tablet.
4080460	4082540	A lot of people do YouTube on their phones.
4082540	4085340	I imagine it was probably mostly kids with 2DS at this point.
4085340	4086940	They were probably still using YouTube.
4086940	4092540	So as Joe and Hunter Matt says, to be honest, the YouTube app on 3DS was kind of bad to begin with,
4092540	4094460	and they didn't really provide updates to it.
4094460	4097500	So no big loss, I guess, for a lot of people.
4097500	4099660	But I'm sure there's going to be that one person out there that was like,
4099660	4100780	but I was using it.
4101900	4105900	And they'll be sad, but hopefully they'll find a new device to do their YouTube's on.
4106620	4108060	All right, let's take it.
4108060	4109500	Let's take a step back in time.
4109500	4114380	Let's go back to games that are still out and are still available and things that can still be
4114380	4117740	played if you find this at a flea market.
4117740	4121420	We're going to take a trip down memory lane with the classic game of the week.
4121420	4124860	Every week, Dark Soccer steps into the gaming vault and finds a game that she thinks,
4124860	4127180	hey, you guys should check this shit out.
4127180	4135020	But once a month in a 2019 twist, once a month, Dark Soccer instead highlights a soundtrack.
4135020	4138300	In fact, this year, it's 8-bit soundtracks that she thinks,
4138300	4140460	listen up because this is some good music.
4140460	4141740	So Dark Soccer is important.
4141740	4143020	This means something.
4143020	4145020	What is the classic soundtrack of the month?
4145020	4146140	Blaster Master.
4146140	4147020	Great pick.
4147020	4147520	Yeah.
4148140	4151500	And I had the music running through my head earlier today and I'm like,
4151500	4153980	oh shit, I haven't done Blaster Master for music.
4157980	4159100	Isn't this the best?
4159100	4159820	It really is.
4160860	4161360	Anyway.
4162620	4165180	Chat, let me know if the audio is too loud.
4165180	4168220	I think it's a little louder than usual, but I don't think it's too loud.
4168220	4171260	Well, anyway, Blaster Master came out in 1988.
4172220	4175580	Of course, on the Nintendo Entertainment System, or Famicom.
4176380	4180780	And it really was very adventurous music.
4180780	4183260	I mean, it made me feel like you were on a quest.
4184140	4187180	And heroically on a quest, I might add.
4187980	4194540	So at any rate, the music was actually composed by Kodaka Naoki.
4195420	4199820	Other games that he did that people might know were,
4202780	4204540	let's see, Route 16 Turbo.
4205340	4208060	A lot of these only came out in Japan.
4208060	4210540	Spy Hunter, but of course that's also a Peter Gunn theme.
4214140	4216380	There was Dead Zone.
4216380	4217740	I'm trying to think of some other ones.
4217740	4218540	Freedom Force.
4219420	4221340	Blaster Master, as we just said here.
4222220	4223420	After Burner for Famicom.
4224220	4224720	Batman.
4225580	4226700	Fester's Quest.
4226700	4228220	City Hunter for PC Engine.
4229020	4229980	Journey to Silius.
4231100	4233340	Remember, I brought that one up as a game.
4235020	4236460	So this guy gets a gold star.
4237100	4238540	Super Spy Hunter.
4238540	4241260	He did a bunch of Batman games.
4241260	4244220	And he also did Super Fantasy Zone for the Genesis.
4244220	4247100	So of course, he's instantly awesome sauce.
4248060	4251580	As far as those others who worked on the game,
4253100	4256860	we actually have for our sound programmer,
4256860	4258620	we have Morita Nagisa.
4258620	4263660	We have also for the music driver, Seya Shinichi.
4263660	4267900	So just really good team in all of these,
4267900	4269020	you know, in various different ways.
4269020	4272220	We worked on the music for a bunch of different really good games.
4272940	4277500	So I really can't say too much else, you know,
4277500	4279820	about how awesome the music is.
4280540	4281500	It's all iconic.
4281500	4282620	Every level is, of course,
4282620	4284300	but none more so than the very first one
4284300	4286540	where everyone has played that level.
4286540	4287260	And so there you go.
4288540	4289900	It's Blaster Master.
4291420	4293500	That is your classic game or classic game soundtrack.
4295180	4298140	And, you know, although I would encourage everybody
4298140	4299580	to go find the old version of this,
4299580	4301820	it's on like Wii Virtual Comedy.
4301820	4302940	Obviously, that won't do you any good anymore,
4302940	4305100	but I think it was on Wii U's Virtual Console as well,
4305100	4305980	if I remember right.
4306540	4308780	And then, of course, there's the remake, Blaster Master Zero,
4308780	4312140	which, you know, as far as remakes go, it's not bad.
4312940	4315660	And, you know, the way they reinterpreted the music and all that,
4315660	4317180	they still did a pretty good job.
4317180	4319420	So, you know, it's certainly better than nothing.
4319420	4321740	Yeah, I could sit and listen to this all day.
4321740	4322300	Yeah.
4322300	4323980	Oh, and of course, start to see it points out,
4323980	4325980	it is part of the Switch Online service.
4325980	4327580	So if you have the classic NES library,
4327580	4328620	you already have access to this.
4328620	4329580	So go play it.
4329580	4330080	Yay.
4331040	4332160	And, you know, some of these,
4332160	4334000	like now that we're getting into some of the later stages,
4334000	4335520	like everybody knows the stage one music,
4335520	4338400	but I think this is, excuse me, stage three of this play right now.
4339040	4340720	Yeah, there's a lot of great songs.
4341520	4342640	If you get that far.
4342640	4344080	Yeah, if you can get that far.
4344080	4350240	But thanks to, excuse me, thanks to Switch Online and so forth,
4350240	4351920	you know, you can use the save states and stuff.
4351920	4354240	And I think that rewind features out now,
4354240	4356960	so help you out a little bit with some of those harder fights.
4356960	4357460	Agreed.
4358420	4360740	There it is, your classic soundtrack of the month,
4361380	4364900	Blaster Master, 8-bit soundtrack for the NES.
4364900	4366980	If they did like a Pokemon version,
4366980	4368740	they could do Blast Hoistmaster.
4370820	4371940	I'd play it.
4371940	4372820	Noted.
4372820	4374500	All right, we're going to move on.
4374500	4376980	Let's get into some rapid fire news
4376980	4380260	and quickly travel around the gaming sphere
4380260	4381780	and check out some quick news.
4381780	4382580	Loki.
4382580	4386980	So our awesome games that we're going to get for August,
4387060	4389060	starting with PlayStation Plus.
4389060	4392260	Sniper Elite 4 and the Wipeout Omega Collection
4392260	4393700	are going to be those two games.
4394260	4396340	It's sad that it's only two games nowadays,
4396340	4399220	but Wipeout Omega Collection would be cool.
4399220	4400820	I'm not a huge fan of Sniper Elite,
4400820	4402340	but I'll take three.
4403540	4406340	And then, of course, on the Microsoft side of things,
4406340	4410100	we have Gears of War 4 on Xbox One
4410100	4414100	and Forza Motorsport 6, two great titles there.
4414980	4416020	Gears of War is going to be available
4416020	4419220	for the month of August and Forza Motorsport 6
4419220	4420660	will be from the middle point
4420660	4423460	to the middle point of September.
4423460	4426500	And then, of course, your Xbox 360 compatible games.
4426500	4427620	You have Torchlight,
4427620	4429620	which is going to be the first half of August.
4429620	4430980	And then the second half,
4430980	4433060	you get Castlevania Lord of Shadow.
4435460	4436340	And then, of course,
4436980	4438820	since we're talking about free games
4438820	4440660	and we're all on Twitch right now,
4441460	4445140	Twitch Prime has some free games this month as well.
4445140	4447380	So you get a few games,
4447380	4449700	including Wonder Boy, Pumped, BMX Pro,
4450660	4452020	Mabel and The Wood,
4452820	4456020	and then Automachef, or Automachef.
4457140	4460100	And that's awesome.
4460100	4462020	I keep forgetting to check for games.
4462020	4468180	Usually they have the in-game currency
4468180	4470420	or skins or something like that
4470420	4474180	for a lot of these online games.
4474180	4478580	But I remember we used to get more of the free games,
4478580	4479620	like indie games and stuff.
4479620	4481540	So I don't know if that stopped for a little bit
4481540	4482980	and then they started doing it again.
4482980	4485780	But I now remember to start looking at that stuff.
4486740	4488740	Yeah, Twitch, if you do have Twitch Prime,
4488740	4490020	they do have some pretty good deals
4490020	4493140	in the giveaway stuff.
4493140	4494900	I want to say I still see a few indie games
4494900	4495940	in there now and then.
4495940	4497540	It doesn't always start off the month either.
4497540	4499060	Sometimes it shows up a little later.
4499060	4500260	So yeah.
4501140	4502180	And then of course,
4502180	4503540	I know you didn't go over it yet,
4503540	4505860	but if you are using the Epic Games Store,
4505860	4507380	I know that store has a lot of controversy
4507380	4508260	with it sometimes.
4508260	4510020	But if you are using the Epic Games Store,
4510660	4513060	there is a lot of stuff to find there too.
4513620	4516180	And they're now giving away free games weekly.
4516180	4517540	And if I'm not mistaken,
4517540	4519540	this week's game is Alan Wake,
4519540	4521460	which I think has been given away free before.
4521460	4522900	So a lot of you probably have it.
4522900	4524580	But if for some reason you've still missed out
4524580	4526100	on Alan Wake after all this time,
4526100	4528180	speaking of great Xbox 360 titles,
4528900	4530420	that is a fantastic one that you should
4530420	4531940	be checking out as Alan Wake.
4531940	4534500	Yeah, I want to say that I have that
4534500	4536340	from one of the Humble Bundles
4536340	4537620	that I've purchased.
4537620	4538420	But yeah,
4538420	4540100	I think most people have probably picked it up
4540100	4540900	one way or another right now.
4540900	4542260	But that is a great one.
4542260	4545460	Yes, Alan Wake and For Honor are free right now.
4545460	4547060	Oh yeah, For Honor is up there too.
4547060	4548260	So cool.
4548260	4549060	I will have those.
4549060	4550180	Build up your free game library.
4550180	4551140	To my library.
4551140	4551860	All right.
4551860	4553780	Well, moving on and talking about
4553780	4557540	some things going on with the Halo TV series.
4557540	4559860	So you remember at Showtime's doing a Halo show?
4559860	4560660	Remember that?
4560660	4562660	I because I forgot until I heard the news this week.
4562660	4563220	I forgot.
4563220	4563620	That's right.
4563620	4565300	Showtime's doing a Halo show
4565300	4567380	and they have announced some casting.
4567380	4569540	So Natasha McElhone,
4569540	4571140	I hope I'm saying that right.
4571140	4573540	She was on the show Ronin and Californication.
4574260	4576100	She's going to be playing Cortana.
4576100	4577380	She will be the Cortana AI
4577380	4578900	in that game's pretty big role, right?
4578900	4580340	She had a Windows 10 feature
4580340	4582100	that then got scaled back, named after her.
4582980	4585220	Also playing Dr. Catherine Helsey,
4585220	4588420	who is the creator of Spartan soldiers like Master Chief.
4588420	4589780	And I'm pretty sure there's a tie there
4589780	4591380	to the Cortana and all that as well.
4593300	4595140	There will also be some other folks.
4595140	4597060	Bokeem Woodbine from Fargo
4597060	4599300	is going to be playing Sorin 066.
4600100	4600740	Let's see.
4600740	4604660	Shabana Azmi will play the Office of Naval Intelligence head
4604660	4606340	Margaret Paranigoski.
4606340	4607700	I hope I said that right.
4607700	4610180	And yeah, let's see some other Spartans.
4610180	4612820	Bentley Kalu from Avengers Age of Ultron
4612820	4615060	and Natasha Kolzak from The Witcher.
4615060	4616980	Kate Kennedy from Catastrophe.
4616980	4618020	So that's pretty cool.
4618740	4621700	The series will not start production until later this year,
4621700	4625540	and it will be on TV the first quarter of 2021.
4625540	4627140	So it's still a little ways out.
4627140	4628980	Gee, no wonder I didn't remember it.
4628980	4629620	Yeah.
4629620	4633060	So anyway, it's always, I think Spielberg's involved,
4633060	4635140	if I remember right, was the thing with this.
4635140	4636100	So yeah.
4636100	4636740	Anyway, there you go.
4636740	4638820	Halo TV show and some of the casting.
4638820	4640580	And one other story I have for you
4640580	4641860	before we go over to Dark Sakura.
4642500	4644580	This story has to do with something
4644580	4646260	that Riot Games is working on.
4646260	4648020	We know that Riot Games, of course,
4648020	4649700	is highly tied to League of Legends.
4649700	4650740	That's their biggest game.
4651300	4653860	But they did confirm at EVO, finally,
4654980	4656660	that they are working on a fighting game.
4657620	4660260	The fighting game, let's see, Tom Cannon,
4660260	4663220	who's the founder of EVO, who works for Riot now,
4663860	4666340	called it the worst kept secret in the universe.
4666340	4667860	So during EVO's live stream, he said,
4668820	4672020	excuse me, back in 2016, we joined forces with Riot
4672020	4674180	and I said we were going to go into the hole for a while.
4674180	4675460	I want to be able to let people know
4675460	4677220	on the worst kept secret in the universe,
4677220	4678820	which I can confirm we are working
4678820	4681060	on a fighting game for Riot.
4681060	4683620	Riot acquired Radiant Entertainment,
4683620	4686180	which was the studio that he was a part of.
4686180	4688180	So that's where this all comes together.
4689620	4692500	They made an online fighting game called Rising Thunder.
4693140	4695380	So anyway, no other details about the game,
4695380	4698820	just it's coming, wait for it, anticipation,
4698820	4699540	all that good stuff.
4700340	4701300	Please look forward to it.
4702180	4702500	All right.
4703300	4707700	Dark Saga, do you have anything for us with rapid fire news?
4707700	4710500	Well, there was a leak out about new characters
4710500	4712740	coming out for Street Fighter 5.
4712740	4714340	And so Calcomes is like, okay, here you go.
4714340	4715140	Here's some trailers.
4715780	4723460	So we have, looks like Lucia from Final Fight 3.
4724180	4729380	We have E. Honda from, you know, classic Street Fighter.
4729380	4737540	And we have Poison from Final Fight, sorry.
4737540	4739380	So pretty cool group.
4740500	4741940	I'd say they're going to be fun to use.
4744660	4746020	And I'm sure a lot of people were like,
4746020	4747620	we want Honda for real.
4747620	4750340	And his, I actually saw like what all of his outfits are.
4750340	4752660	He has kind of like this pimp looking outfit
4752660	4755140	for his business outfit is actually kind of fun.
4756020	4758980	Back in the day, back in Street Fighter 2, like in the day,
4758980	4759700	like, what was that?
4759700	4761380	Probably like early high school, junior high school
4761380	4762500	when I was playing Street Fighter 2.
4762500	4763620	I used to love E. Honda.
4763620	4765620	Like I just love that character because I would,
4765620	4767060	it was all about the a hundred hand slap.
4767060	4768420	You just hit that punch button real fast
4768420	4769860	and it was very, very annoying.
4769860	4771940	And then of course Chun Li had her version of that,
4771940	4773460	but for some reason his was better.
4773460	4775140	Oh, because in the later Street Fighter games,
4775140	4776980	you can move back and forth while you were doing it.
4776980	4778420	In like Super Street Fighter and stuff.
4778420	4779140	So, yeah.
4780100	4786020	And then also the probably worst character ever
4786020	4788980	in a Dragon Ball movie, Janenba is going to be
4788980	4792100	in Dragon Ball FighterZ and Gogeta
4792100	4793700	is going to be in there too.
4793700	4797380	So that fucking movie was terrible,
4798180	4800580	but it has like one of my favorite lines in there
4800580	4804020	because it's okay.
4804020	4806180	In the movie, Goku and Vegeta are dead.
4806180	4809300	So they're in hell fighting this evil hell beast
4810100	4812740	and Goku spends like half the movie.
4812740	4813460	We need to fuse.
4813460	4814500	We need to fuse to beat it.
4814500	4816660	And Vegeta is like, I'd rather die than fuse.
4816660	4818820	He's like, but Vegeta, we're already dead.
4819540	4820980	So it has like my favorite line,
4820980	4822100	but it's a really bad movie.
4823380	4824020	Okay.
4824020	4824520	All right.
4826420	4828340	So let's travel around the world
4828340	4829860	and check out some release dates
4829860	4832180	and see what's coming out in this gaming store near you.
4832180	4832680	Loki.
4833220	4834180	Not a lot of stuff.
4834180	4836980	We've got Age of Wonders, Planet Fall on PC,
4836980	4838980	PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
4839780	4842820	Illusion of La Fosia.
4842820	4845300	And that's coming out on PlayStation 4.
4846420	4852020	Metal Wolf Chaos XD on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
4853540	4856340	We've got Pillars of Eternity Complete Edition
4856340	4857300	on Nintendo Switch.
4857940	4861140	Sword Art Online Fatal Bullet Complete Edition
4861140	4862180	on Nintendo Switch.
4864420	4866420	And that's it.
4868660	4869940	Sorry, we got distracted here.
4869940	4870660	The cat made it.
4870660	4871700	Did he knock over the bottle?
4871700	4872180	What was it?
4872180	4872740	Was that you?
4874580	4876260	Oh, did it wake him up or something?
4876260	4877140	It disturbed him.
4877940	4878660	Oh, okay.
4878660	4879060	Weird.
4879060	4879300	All right.
4879300	4880340	Well, as long as he's okay.
4880340	4880660	All right.
4880660	4881380	Sorry.
4881380	4882100	Just it.
4882100	4883620	Mr. Smoosh is very important.
4884660	4886500	He will be protected at all costs.
4887220	4888100	So, all right.
4888100	4890180	Anyway, sorry about that.
4890180	4893380	So let's go over to Japan and check out releases there in Japan.
4894020	4895140	Coming out in Japan this week,
4895140	4896740	we have quite a few things on PlayStation 4,
4896740	4898900	but many of them are games you've already had here.
4898900	4900580	They're just coming out in Japan for the first time.
4901380	4903140	Or a re-pricing.
4903140	4905620	Fatal 12 is a new game though that's out in Japan.
4905620	4907380	So that is coming out this week.
4908100	4911140	I believe that also has like an English language option in it.
4911140	4912900	So some folks may choose to import that.
4912900	4913300	I don't know.
4913940	4915060	Also on Japan this week,
4915060	4918100	Wolfenstein Youngblood and Wolfenstein Cyberpilot.
4918100	4920180	Also Friday the 13th of the game,
4920180	4922740	moving into the hits collection for PlayStation 4.
4922820	4924020	And let's see.
4924980	4926820	Nioh also gets out.
4926820	4927780	N-I-O-H.
4927780	4930580	Nioh comes out for PlayStation hits.
4930580	4931700	I think that's already been out,
4931700	4933140	but it's getting a price reduction.
4933780	4936420	Going over to the Switch and seeing what we have over there.
4937220	4939460	Puyo Puyo Tetris gets a price reduction
4939460	4941380	and a special price addition there.
4941380	4944020	And Sword Art Online Fatal Bullet.
4944020	4945540	That'll be a catch some eyes.
4945540	4946500	That is out as well.
4946500	4948900	And then Shining Resonance Refrain
4948900	4951620	getting a new price addition there on the Switch as well.
4951620	4953940	So some rereleases and some familiar things,
4953940	4955940	but a couple of new games in there as well.
4955940	4957140	Dark Sakura, how about the UK?
4957140	4961060	I've only got three things for UK in the upcoming week.
4961060	4963380	On the 5th, we have Age of Wonders Planetfall.
4964420	4968340	That's going to be on PlayStation, Xbox, PC.
4969700	4972100	For Switch, we have on the 8th,
4972100	4975780	Ugly Dolls and Imperfect Adventure and Ultra Wings.
4976820	4979380	Also, Ugly Dolls will be on PlayStation and Xbox.
4980180	4980900	That's it.
4980900	4981780	All right.
4981780	4983940	Well, now we're going to get to the mailbag.
4983940	4984820	Sorry, Dark Sakura.
4984820	4986740	I know you getting ready to eat dinner there,
4986740	4988180	but that's OK.
4988980	4990900	Once we get past this, you'll have plenty of time to eat.
4990900	4992420	So we're going to get to our mailbag statement.
4992420	4994500	Every week, we invite you guys to send us emails
4994500	4997780	to participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
4997780	4998180	It's fine.
4998180	5000740	And we pick a few of our favorite emails to read here on the show.
5001300	5003860	Hopefully nobody in our inbox trying to tell us
5003860	5005780	that they caught us wasterbaiting this week
5005780	5007460	like we had last week.
5008260	5008900	Dark Sakura.
5008900	5010500	I deleted that and bypassed the trash.
5010980	5011460	OK, good.
5013780	5014260	Hi, all.
5014260	5015780	It's Metal Mayhem or Raginator,
5015780	5017300	whatever name you want to refer to me by.
5017300	5019140	I don't really personally care to be H.
5019140	5020980	Oh, whatever name, huh?
5020980	5021300	Let's see.
5021300	5022820	I'm going to call you Wastinator.
5022820	5024100	OK, Wastinator, yes.
5028020	5029140	Wastinator.
5029140	5033220	I thought I'd try writing in since it may be difficult at best for me to call in.
5033220	5038340	My PC headsets mic has bit the dust and doing a call via Discord on my phone
5038340	5043540	will be a bigger pain in the ass than a visit to the proctologist that doesn't use lube.
5045300	5046900	I didn't need that imagery.
5047620	5050100	This week I thought I'd write in regarding PC gaming.
5050100	5053700	For brevity reasons, I won't recount why I got into PC gaming in my email.
5053700	5055380	That's been covered to death in the past.
5055940	5056340	Thank you.
5056900	5063140	Nonetheless, I'll mention that my first PC game
5064100	5069060	was Diablo II war chest version with base game expansion manual and guide
5069060	5071060	and that I got it at Target for 20 bucks.
5071940	5075540	I got the game seeing as I had played Diablo on PS1
5076340	5078900	and loved that game so I figured Diablo II would be good too.
5079700	5083540	A few months later I joined Steam because Rob always used to mention
5083540	5085780	them and their sales being akin to crack.
5085780	5086740	My words, not his.
5087860	5091860	Looking back, at this point I prefer PC gaming over console gaming
5091860	5094500	due to the deals in one form or another.
5094500	5097860	I managed to build a massive game library over the seven years,
5097860	5099060	about 2000 games or so.
5099060	5101220	That sounds like my normal games collection.
5101220	5102660	Yeah, wow, it's so impressive.
5102660	5105780	I never had that many games on consoles.
5105780	5109060	All that being said, I'd like to pose these questions.
5109060	5111540	For those of you that are PC gamers,
5111540	5114660	what was your first PC game and why did you pick that as your first game?
5114660	5116900	Additionally, what drew you to PC gaming to begin with?
5117540	5121140	Fun fact, this email was completed and released before Loki completed and released Time to Car.
5122260	5124980	What was your first PC game?
5124980	5125780	I don't know if I can remember.
5125780	5129940	My first PC was a 386 SX16 and it didn't run much.
5129940	5130900	Commodore 64?
5132260	5135620	Oh yeah, I guess Commodore 64 was a personal computer,
5135620	5137460	if you want to say it in the purest sense.
5137460	5140660	The first game I remember playing on the Commodore 64
5140660	5143700	would have been one of two games that my memory pulls up.
5143700	5147940	A game called Le Mans, like a racing game,
5147940	5150100	and you would actually use the paddle as a cartridge
5150980	5152580	that you would plug in the device.
5152580	5157460	And it was like a pole position type of thing, but overhead.
5157460	5159460	So the graphics weren't quite as complicated,
5159460	5162340	but I do remember playing that and that was a really fun racing game,
5162340	5164500	you know, when you're like seven years old.
5165060	5165860	So I remember that.
5166820	5172260	And then I also remember Slinky was one of the first PC games I had.
5172260	5175540	And that game was scary because the music was scary
5175540	5178900	and the big enemies that would come out were scary looking.
5178900	5181300	But Slinky was basically a Qbert ripoff.
5181300	5183220	It was completely a Qbert ripoff,
5183220	5184740	but the board looked a little different
5184740	5187220	and some of the monsters were very, very different.
5187220	5188660	So like, it was creepy.
5188660	5190500	Like when you die, all the monsters would come out
5190500	5191940	and then like attack your corpse
5191940	5194260	and a little flower would fall down like you were dead.
5194260	5195860	Like it was, that's the part that was scary.
5196420	5199860	So yeah, I guess if we went all the way back to Commodore 64,
5199860	5200820	it'd be that.
5200820	5201780	Pure PC?
5203220	5203780	I don't know.
5203780	5206020	I don't remember what the first games we had were.
5206020	5207780	It had to have been a Sierra game.
5207780	5210100	It had to be something like King's Quest 4
5210900	5213940	or something that would run off the disks.
5216020	5216740	I'm trying to remember.
5216740	5217860	I haven't, I'm drawing a blank.
5217860	5219140	Maybe Jones and the Fastlane.
5220260	5221620	No, I feel like that game came out later.
5221620	5223380	I feel like that was a 486 game.
5223380	5226180	I remember playing on the PS, my friend,
5226180	5229460	my friend had a PS2, not a PlayStation 2,
5229460	5233140	but the IBM PS2, because I remember everything was PS2.
5233140	5236420	In fact, they still sell PS2 compatible keyboards.
5236420	5238100	That's what, you know, the design was for.
5239060	5242260	I remember playing an X-Men game that was really fun.
5242260	5244740	You had that, you were basically trying to save Storm.
5244740	5247620	She'd been kidnapped and you were playing the other X-Men.
5247620	5250500	Well, the whole, the reason why they couldn't have
5250500	5252820	Storm be a character because she's too powerful.
5253860	5256740	So they had to have a story where she gets kidnapped
5256740	5258420	so they didn't have to make her a character.
5259700	5261620	But you play it like a lot of the other X-Men.
5261620	5263060	I remember that game being a lot of fun.
5263620	5266340	So anyway, those are the best answers I have.
5266580	5267860	TI 99 4A.
5269380	5271380	It was, I had to look up the name again,
5271380	5272740	cause I know it wasn't Space Invaders.
5272740	5275380	It was TI Invaders and there was Munch Man.
5276420	5280020	You guys also Parsec and Car Wars.
5280020	5281140	Car Wars was a big one.
5282820	5285460	I don't really remember anything on the Coleco Adam
5285460	5288020	because all the cassettes would get erased
5288020	5289540	in a power surge.
5289540	5290580	So that was stupid.
5291380	5294420	And then I'll be honest, I had used like all Macs at school
5294420	5295380	and everything.
5295380	5300340	So I'd say probably my first PC era game
5301140	5304420	other than Gemstone, which was a tech space game,
5305300	5307940	was probably the occasional different MUD
5307940	5312740	or the Rogue clones and Doom.
5314980	5316020	Doom's a good pick.
5316020	5317300	That's a classic, classic PC game.
5317300	5317800	And Loom.
5318820	5319540	Oh yeah.
5319540	5320500	You know, I love Loom.
5320500	5321000	Oh yeah.
5321880	5325800	I remember I had a game and I think it was LucasArts.
5325800	5327240	Legend of Chirandia.
5327240	5329640	You know, you've brought this game on the show, Loki.
5329640	5332200	It's on Westwood Studios.
5332200	5332760	That's right.
5332760	5335560	It was like another studio that tried to kind of get in there.
5335560	5336040	That's right.
5336040	5337000	You're right.
5337000	5338360	So yeah, I remember that game.
5338360	5338600	Yeah.
5338600	5339800	EA killed them.
5339800	5340600	Oh, that's too bad.
5340600	5341400	Westwood.
5341400	5343720	They also did the Command and Conquer.
5343720	5344600	Oh, right.
5344600	5344920	Right.
5344920	5345240	Okay.
5345880	5346600	Loki, what about you?
5346600	5348280	Earliest PC gaming memories.
5348280	5350120	Also TI 99 4A.
5350360	5354040	I also had Munch Man, but one I remember playing the most was Alpiner.
5357080	5358680	I'm sure there's other games I had as well,
5358680	5361320	but those are the only ones I remember off hand.
5362840	5363800	Good question.
5363800	5369800	My first actual PC, aside from the TI 99, was an IBM.
5369800	5370280	I don't remember.
5370280	5376920	It was a 286 PC and I had SimCity and I played it on a monochrome monitor.
5376920	5378120	Oh, good pick.
5378840	5379400	Yeah.
5379400	5379800	Love it.
5380600	5381320	Good picks.
5381320	5383960	I did have Where in Time is Carmen Sandiego.
5383960	5385640	I played a lot more of that in the world.
5385640	5389800	Somebody in chat said the Where in Blank is Carmen Sandiego was their first game.
5389800	5391160	So very good.
5391160	5391960	Good picks all around.
5391960	5392440	Good question.
5392440	5393880	That was a fun trip down memory lane.
5393880	5394360	So there you go.
5394920	5396520	Any other emails or was that it?
5396520	5397240	All right, that's it.
5397240	5402520	So participate at orangeloungeradio.com if you want to send us an email in a future week.
5402520	5405720	Meanwhile, we have some more stories for you guys before we get to Discord tonight.
5407000	5408680	Oh, I apologize.
5408680	5409880	We do have one more.
5410520	5411400	Last minute email.
5411400	5411720	All right.
5412360	5415640	Rob, when you say you're sorting your Pokemon and Pokemon go by star rating,
5415640	5418360	are you seeing all your zero star Pokemon at once?
5418360	5419080	How do you do that?
5419080	5420440	I'm not seeing such an option.
5420440	5421480	This comes from Robert M.
5421480	5422520	Oh, good question.
5422520	5428680	So all you do is when you go into Pokemon first, number one is more important.
5428680	5432040	Make sure you have latest version because if you're still running an old version,
5432040	5434200	you're not going to be able to do that.
5434200	5437560	But then what you do is you go into in the game.
5437560	5444840	You're going to actually go into your Pokemon, which you can do with the little with the Pokeball.
5444840	5448120	You touch that and you do Pokemon, and that's going to bring up all the Pokemon that you have.
5448120	5449000	They can't see on the camera.
5449000	5449960	They can't see it on the camera.
5449960	5450200	All right.
5450200	5450700	I tried.
5451480	5457160	But then you tap the magnifying glass at the top of the screen and you type zero and it's an asterisk.
5457160	5459880	So when I say star, I mean the asterisk.
5459880	5463080	And that's going to bring up all of your zero star Pokemon,
5463080	5466760	which sadly two of the shinies I caught yesterday are zero stars.
5466760	5468920	So use the asterisk and that's it.
5468920	5470280	That's the only two characters you need.
5471000	5476040	Four star will show you all of your Pokemon that are 100%, which is pretty cool to see.
5476040	5479080	I now have two centrets that are 100%.
5479080	5481240	I wish I had a better Pokemon at 100%, but whatever.
5482920	5490440	And you can also use three star for the wonder Pokemon or that's what they're called.
5490440	5494200	If you're on the blue team, I forget what the red team and the yellow team say it on those appraisals.
5494200	5495000	So that's it.
5495000	5497320	Just the two characters, zero and the asterisk,
5497320	5500040	and use the magnifying glass at the top in order to be able to do that.
5501560	5502200	Happy to help.
5503320	5505480	Now that is all of our emails tonight.
5505480	5510840	So participate at orangelaundry.com if you want to send us an email in a future week.
5510840	5513880	In the meantime, something you want to add?
5513880	5515880	No, just my dinner was ambitious.
5515880	5516680	Oh yeah.
5516680	5519240	It looks, it looks, you're welcome to some.
5519240	5521960	Well, it smells like Chinese in here now, but it's a good smell.
5522440	5524920	Lemon chicken and chicken chow mein.
5524920	5529000	Which I don't say it on air, but I'm curious which place you got that from.
5529000	5530600	So China something.
5530600	5531000	Okay.
5531000	5531320	All right.
5531320	5532120	I believe you.
5532120	5533000	Anyway, let's move on.
5533560	5535400	Loki, let's get into some other news here.
5535400	5539000	Let's talk about things that, um, never happened.
5539000	5543400	And that is that fancy graphics update for Minecraft.
5543400	5547800	That was supposed to give us the 4k visuals and the improved lighting and all that stuff.
5548760	5553240	Promised to us back in 2017 during E3.
5553240	5556120	And unfortunately we haven't heard anything about it.
5556760	5560040	The reason may be because there's not a lot of people working on it.
5560040	5565080	Apparently only about eight people on the team are actually working on this project.
5565080	5569480	And apparently it was harder than they originally thought because they have to actually
5569480	5574040	rewrite or overhaul many portions of the engine to get it to actually work.
5574920	5580520	So the super duper graphics pack, not going to be out anytime soon, unfortunately.
5582360	5582860	Rude.
5583320	5583820	Mean.
5585160	5586920	I want my 4k Minecraft.
5586920	5587320	Damn it.
5587320	5591000	Well, in the meantime, PC and Sonic ether's unbelievable shaders.
5592120	5592760	I guess.
5592760	5594280	Leave it to the mod community.
5594280	5598120	Speaking of the mic community, let's I'm a totally tangent this into something else.
5598120	5601400	So something I've noticed Alan has been playing a ton of this week.
5601400	5602520	Black Mesa.
5602520	5607400	Because apparently, so, you know, Black Mesa is like, they redid Half-Life, right?
5607400	5610520	So, um, but they've been working on the ending sequence.
5610520	5612920	The Zen, I think it's called is that last sequence.
5612920	5618760	So they just put out the first part of the Zen levels like this last week.
5618760	5622360	So he's been playing a lot of that, just kind of revisiting Black Mesa because that's
5622360	5624920	Half-Life is like one of Alan's like all time favorite games.
5624920	5626520	So I know he revisits it once a year.
5626520	5628920	So this is like his good opportunity to do that.
5628920	5634600	So, but funny enough, the other game that Alan has been playing a lot lately is No Man's Sky.
5634600	5637160	And there's some new news on No Man's Sky this week.
5637160	5640520	We talked a little bit about this last week, but now we have a date.
5640520	5643560	No Man's Sky VR, which is the Beyond version.
5643560	5648040	So No Man's Sky Beyond will be out on August 14th.
5648040	5651240	So there's some updates, including PSVR.
5651240	5652120	That'll be very cool.
5652760	5654600	I'm excited to try that on PlayStation.
5654600	5655880	That's where I have the game.
5655880	5657000	Alan plays on PC.
5657000	5658040	I play on PlayStation.
5658040	5662760	So sadly we're not in the same universe, but Beyond is also going to expand social
5662760	5664440	and multiplayer options.
5664440	5668680	So they're going to make it a little more like, you don't want to call it an MMO, but
5668680	5672360	some of those things I think we all imagined in the beginning are going to be a little
5672360	5673560	more there.
5673560	5674840	And this update is free.
5674840	5678440	It's not going to be something like a micro transaction, like you might see in an MMO.
5678440	5679640	So very exciting.
5681240	5684840	You're going to actually be able to meet and play with other people if you want.
5684840	5687480	I don't know if I want to play with other people, but there you go.
5688520	5688920	All right.
5688920	5689560	Dark Sakura.
5691640	5692040	Whale.
5693240	5694520	How dare you when I'm digesting.
5695400	5697320	Anyway, Pokemon Go.
5698120	5699880	We haven't forgotten that it exists, right?
5699880	5704680	Especially since you just got asked a question about sorting your Pokemanses.
5706440	5713320	Well, the game actually hit a billion downloads in just three years after it was released.
5714280	5720760	Pokemon Company actually released some videos commemorating the big marker.
5721400	5728280	And of course, some of those billion downloads include redownload, but it's still a pretty
5728280	5732120	good number, especially since they're like, oh, that won't make it past a year.
5733560	5734040	Look, bitch.
5734920	5741160	Anyway, of course, the numbers have slowed down because it's a mobile game, and we've
5741160	5744040	just had Harry Potter Wizards Untie come out.
5744040	5744360	Sorry.
5744360	5744860	Unite.
5746360	5747640	Wizards Untie.
5747640	5748040	Love it.
5748040	5748360	Okay.
5748360	5749000	My brain.
5750440	5751240	No, it's fine.
5751240	5751720	It's funny.
5752840	5753400	Yeah.
5753400	5755240	I just keep thinking Untie.
5756760	5759080	It's one of the spells you cast.
5759080	5759800	Alohomora.
5760360	5761000	That's unlocked.
5762920	5771000	But anyway, it still gets about 147 million users per month.
5771880	5776200	Um, and that was as of May this year.
5776200	5780520	Hey, when I, you know, I just drove around the capital and I was floored by how many
5780520	5783080	people I saw playing out there in the 100 degree heat.
5783080	5786920	So there's still, I mean, Ralts is probably one of the most desirable Pokemon.
5786920	5789080	A lot of people were waiting for this community today.
5789080	5792920	Um, but, uh, yeah, I was, I was still shocked at how many people I saw out there.
5792920	5795880	My buddy right now is a Ralts so I can get the special evolution.
5796680	5798360	So nice.
5798440	5804440	Or whatever the one up from Ralts is, uh, the, the one that's Gardevoir, but,
5804440	5806440	uh, but there's a male one Galliate or something.
5806440	5807640	That's the one I'm trying to get.
5807640	5808200	Yeah.
5808200	5813800	So I'm working on my Ralts right now so that I can use.
5813800	5816840	I need to get another Sino stone on it, but yeah.
5816840	5818600	So that's why I need to do a trade with you today.
5818600	5821160	Those Sino stones are hard to get, but yeah, I'll trade with you.
5821160	5821640	No problem.
5821640	5822140	Yeah.
5823320	5824120	All right.
5824120	5825560	Uh, moving on just a couple more stories.
5825560	5828200	Then we're going to open up Discord for your calls.
5828200	5831880	If you want to give us a call over at vognetwork.com slash discord.
5831880	5832380	Loki.
5833000	5842600	So somebody has actually taken it upon themselves to remake, uh, Elder Scrolls Daggerfall in Unity.
5843320	5847080	So it's a project that they started back in 2014 Daggerfall Unity.
5847720	5853800	Uh, apparently they were trying to figure out how to actually port it to a modern PC
5853800	5856520	because right now it's been played through DOS box.
5856520	5863640	So he reverse engineered, um, basically how everything was kind of being read,
5863640	5865640	all the different textures and stuff.
5865640	5867560	And now they've put it in there.
5867560	5875800	Apparently it is the largest elder school game with a 62,394 square miles of in-game world.
5876840	5879640	So it says it takes 60 hours to cross on foot.
5880840	5881800	That's pretty crazy.
5882440	5882680	Yeah.
5882680	5886520	Those, those older elder scrolls games, probably because they weren't as graphic intensive.
5886520	5889960	So the design of the world didn't necessarily need to be as much, you know,
5889960	5894440	like you look at a game like Skyrim and the environmental detail that goes into that.
5894440	5898360	That's, you know, even though that world is massive, it is smaller than compared to
5898360	5901160	these other games where you didn't have to have that same level of detail video.
5901160	5902200	It's pretty crazy.
5902200	5902520	Yeah.
5902520	5903320	It looks awesome.
5903320	5909160	So they did release, um, apparently some tools for Unity back in 2015.
5909160	5916280	Um, although now it's, you know, getting more further along, basically it says, um,
5916280	5923080	that they have the alpha build, which allows, um, Daggerfall to be played start to finish in Unity.
5923880	5926920	Um, it's just crazy.
5926920	5928520	Just the stuff that they have in here.
5928520	5935800	So apparently they do, he does have a page dedicated to his process or progress.
5935800	5943000	So, uh, at the website, www.dfworkshop.net and that's under his projects, Daggerfall unity.
5943000	5945800	And so they have the different builds that are available and stuff for that.
5946440	5953320	But, um, the brand new build, he has, um, it's alpha 10.3 and it's available.
5953320	5956600	You can download on a windows Mac and Linux.
5956600	5960360	Kind of makes you wonder why Bethesda hasn't bothered to go back and do, you know, some,
5960360	5963320	some redoing of their own, but I guess, you know, it is a lot of work.
5963320	5964680	This guy didn't get paid to do it.
5965160	5969400	Cause if they were to go back and use Unity, that would mean working outside their own engine,
5969400	5974600	which, you know, if they can port it into their broken ass engine to make new games.
5974600	5978440	And they wouldn't want to take resources away from elder scrolls six, which I'm sure is,
5978440	5981160	you know, something that they need to have their attention on.
5981160	5986440	So, uh, Questbuster also points out Daggerfall used a kind of procedural generation
5986440	5990280	to create such a huge map littered with towns, villages, and cities.
5990280	5993320	You could try to walk across it or just use quick travel.
5993320	5994200	That's true too.
5994280	5997720	There was a lot more just kind of like procedural generation, uh,
5997720	6002920	as in what you see in no man's sky is a great example of, you know, how vast you can make
6002920	6004520	things with procedural generation.
6004520	6008440	I mean, when you think about how fucking big a game like no man's sky is, it really like
6009400	6012760	makes your mind, you know, makes you go cross-eyed, but that's all an algorithm
6012760	6016200	basically that creates everything and creates it the same way for every player.
6016200	6019640	So pretty neat, but yeah, it would be a similar concept to what you would have seen as some
6019640	6022040	of these older, uh, elder scrolls games.
6022040	6022840	So very cool.
6023400	6023800	All right.
6023800	6028200	Anyway, uh, one more story for you guys and boy, did I save the best for last because
6028200	6030360	I know folks are very excited.
6030360	6033080	Uh, they want to hear all about new carting games.
6033080	6035400	I know y'all are big on Mario Kart, right?
6035400	6039000	Well, this isn't about a new Mario Kart game, but I would say it's just as important.
6040040	6040760	That's right.
6040760	6045560	Uh, this past week we had the announcement of a brand new Garfield Kart game.
6046120	6047480	They're making a sequel.
6047480	6050440	The original Garfield Kart came out in 2013.
6050440	6053240	Then it was remastered or something in 2018.
6053240	6056360	And then, uh, I guess, I don't know, it was, it was taken down.
6056360	6057080	I don't know, whatever.
6057080	6059160	Why would you remaster that game?
6059160	6060120	Why not?
6060120	6061480	Loki, why not?
6061480	6063480	Why would you do dagger fall in unity?
6063480	6064920	Because you can.
6064920	6066280	Because you liked that.
6066280	6066680	That's right.
6066680	6067560	Elder Scrolls game.
6067560	6067960	That's right.
6067960	6073240	Anyway, uh, the game will be getting a sequel on Xbox one, PC, PS4, PC, and switch.
6073240	6075560	Believe it or not, it is again, a cart racing game.
6075560	6077320	Why is that in the Presley's?
6077320	6080360	It is a cart racing game again, just in case you were unclear.
6081240	6082280	It was going to be a car racer.
6082280	6083080	There you go.
6083080	6086680	Uh, Garfield, Odie and John will be the only stars in it.
6086680	6090120	Uh, but there's five other characters, I guess that you unlock later on.
6090120	6093880	Uh, 16 tracks that are inspired by the world of Garfield.
6093880	6094840	How about that?
6094840	6098920	Garfield furious racing is coming out in November.
6098920	6102600	So, uh, let's see if the intro says things like, are you lazy?
6102600	6106200	Like Garfield take shortcuts to overtake the other racers with the spring.
6108280	6110120	I'm sure this game is going to win.
6110120	6112200	All the awards later this year.
6112200	6115640	When we start looking at the game of the year qualifiers and so forth.
6116200	6119720	Uh, some comments in chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network.
6119720	6123480	Dark did see it says at least Garfield cart won't have any microtransactions.
6123480	6126920	Like the crash cart remaster just got later on after the reviews came out.
6128280	6134040	Hopefully, uh, Sia Tabiri says I wanted Garfield cart minus Garfield.
6134040	6136920	Good comment.
6136920	6141480	I would love a Garfield game that like fully leaned into the Garfield names.
6141480	6145880	Sia Tabiri says it's all actually just John driving around alone.
6147480	6148920	I would love a meme cart.
6148920	6151400	I mean, like a code to put in that would just do that.
6151400	6154360	But then how do you get angry Luigi and meet meme racer?
6154360	6155000	I don't know.
6155000	6155800	Anyway.
6155800	6157400	Um, let's see.
6157400	6158760	And also, uh, what was the other comment?
6158760	6162280	Oh, guys, you don't chat says I want to Heathcliff cart screw Garfield.
6164440	6165560	Maybe they could team up.
6165560	6168280	Wasn't Garfield the same one that was paired with us?
6168280	6171320	Uh, acres at one point during its run on TV.
6171320	6171640	Yes.
6171640	6173960	And we know who else was in us acres.
6173960	6175000	Our buddy Greg burger.
6175560	6176280	Oh, that's right.
6176280	6177160	He was.
6177160	6177640	Yep.
6177640	6178280	Yeah.
6178280	6178760	Oh man.
6178760	6179320	Good times.
6179320	6179880	Orson.
6179880	6180440	That's right.
6180440	6182120	He was good time.
6182120	6182920	And Grimlock.
6185080	6185560	All right.
6185560	6188520	Anyway, we are at the point in the show where we're going to take your calls.
6188520	6192440	So if you want to give us a call, you can join us on our discord vog network.com slash
6192680	6197880	And I'll have, you know, I'll have, you know, just in case you're saying that Heathcliff
6197880	6199000	deserves a race game.
6199000	6201240	They did have a Heathcliff racing game.
6201240	6207160	Heathcliff the fast and the furriest also came out on the Wii in 2010.
6207160	6207480	Thanks.
6208120	6211240	Well, this isn't necessarily about video games.
6211240	6213000	It goes back to our opening topic.
6213800	6218360	Um, the website 8chan has been taken down by the hosting company.
6219240	6219720	Oh, wow.
6220600	6225480	So, um, after, you know, cloud fair just said, take it down.
6225480	6229240	They also took down the daily stormer, you know, two years ago, but it found another
6229240	6230360	place with their competition.
6230920	6238440	But I'm just saying that when a supposedly neutral hosting company is done with you,
6238440	6244040	you know, your shit, not the shit, but literal shit you have come out of someone's ass.
6245640	6246840	Just saying, thank you for that.
6247640	6247960	All right.
6248280	6253080	Uh, if you want to give us a call, uh, vog network.com slash discord, uh, we would also
6253080	6257880	welcome comments or questions in our chat room over at twitch TV slash vog network.
6257880	6261320	If you wish to, uh, just ask us, maybe you're too shy to call in.
6261320	6264520	You just want to ask a question that would be okay as well.
6264520	6267320	Otherwise it's going to be an early night here at all our studios tonight, but that's
6267320	6267800	all right.
6267800	6271160	That's the way it goes sometimes, especially because we didn't have a break segment tonight.
6271160	6272440	Um, do you have any last minute stories?
6272440	6272840	Logie?
6274040	6274540	Nope.
6275400	6275880	All right.
6275880	6277240	I don't have anything.
6277240	6279960	Things are a little slow tonight here at studio OLR.
6279960	6281320	What else do we talk about?
6281320	6285160	Any, any, uh, cool collectibles or purchases in your home lately?
6285160	6286120	Dark Sakura.
6286120	6288440	I keep looking at my little indie arcade collection.
6288440	6290520	I'm like, I wonder if there's more of those I'm behind on.
6290520	6293960	I need to get, um, well, California extreme.
6293960	6299080	I got my puka and, um, fry gar that, that doesn't count.
6300600	6304360	I'm playing a lot of Sims and all I've done is build two houses.
6305000	6308520	Uh, as Joe and her map points out, Evo is probably consuming some folks who normally
6308520	6309160	call.
6309160	6310120	Absolutely.
6310120	6312600	I know Ramas at Brony Con, right?
6312600	6313000	Yeah.
6313000	6315720	Like it wasn't like the last one or something like that was this weekend.
6315720	6316520	I heard something about that.
6316520	6318360	It was like the last Brony Con or something.
6318360	6320520	So I know he and Patty were cosplaying.
6320520	6321720	Yeah, no, I saw that.
6321720	6326200	So I, uh, yeah, I'm sure they'll talk about it on anime jam session this week on Tuesday.
6326200	6326700	So, yeah.
6327240	6330680	Have you guys been noticing too, uh, here at VOG network, if you, uh, tune in earlier
6330680	6332760	in the day on Sundays, uh, girls gone, wow.
6332760	6333960	They broadcast on Twitch.
6334120	6338440	So sometimes if you tune into our channel around, uh, probably about like three o'clock
6338440	6343240	Pacific or so, maybe two, maybe earlier, uh, you will see, uh, Raven and EJ doing their
6343240	6344680	show, uh, here on Twitch.
6344680	6345880	So that's pretty cool too.
6345880	6346600	We love that.
6346600	6350360	A lot of our longtime podcast buddies are coming over to Twitch and making the jump
6350360	6350760	over here.
6350760	6351480	Pretty cool.
6351480	6352760	Oh, we have somebody in the green room.
6352760	6353400	Let's get to it.
6353400	6355000	It won't be a quiet night after all.
6355000	6356520	Uh, hi, you are on orange launch radio.
6356520	6356920	Who's this?
6357880	6358520	Yo, what's up guys?
6358520	6359400	This is guys Judo.
6359400	6360040	Hey guys, Judo.
6360040	6360520	Good to hear from you.
6360520	6361400	What's on your mind tonight?
6362360	6366200	Um, I'm a little concerned about no man's sky and, uh, the VR update.
6366920	6369640	How so I can hear myself in the background.
6369640	6370520	That's weird.
6370520	6370840	Sorry.
6370840	6375240	And we might have, the volume might've been up a little high and sometimes it gets picked
6375240	6376200	up on the microphone.
6376200	6378360	So we try to minimize that, but it happens.
6378360	6379240	Go ahead with your question.
6380440	6380760	All right.
6380760	6385000	So we all know that the reason why we're getting this, uh, well, not, not the reason why we're
6385000	6389080	getting the, uh, VR update, but one of the main reasons why we got this new no man's
6389080	6390920	sky is just because of all the complaints.
6390920	6393720	People were saying, you know, this wasn't a game that you promised us and yada, yada,
6393720	6394520	yada.
6394520	6399080	And I feel like that's starting to build up again with this VR thing.
6399080	6401480	Cause I mean, the VR community is going crazy.
6401480	6403160	Like they're acting like this is the second coming.
6403160	6404440	They're like, this is going to be great.
6404440	6405480	This is what VR needs.
6405480	6410440	And I'm just like, I don't know if it's going to be, I don't know if it's going to be as
6410440	6412440	big and special as you think it might be.
6412440	6414920	You know, I want it to be, but I don't think so.
6414920	6419160	Like, I'm not, you know, it's not because I have any beef with, with, uh, with hello
6419160	6421560	games or anything like that, because I love the original no man's sky.
6421560	6425480	I think I actually call your show and tell you guys that I was satisfied with what they
6425480	6427240	originally made, you know?
6427240	6430680	So it's not, you know, it's not me complaining, thinking that they can't build a better game,
6430680	6432840	but I'm just like, I don't know.
6432840	6435240	You guys might want to slow down a little bit on that.
6435240	6437000	And I feel like I'm with you.
6437000	6437560	I'm with you.
6437560	6439400	Don't set the bar too high.
6439400	6441080	Don't get your expectations too high.
6441080	6442200	Cause you're exactly right.
6442200	6444360	This is the exact same mistake people made.
6444440	6446280	The first time around with the game.
6446280	6450760	And I think for those of us that didn't buy into the hype as much, we weren't as disappointed
6450760	6453880	with the font because I remember saying with those early, early press conferences, the
6453880	6455960	no man's sky, like show me the fucking game.
6455960	6458680	And until they do, I'm not going to get my hopes up that high.
6458680	6463080	And you know, because I didn't get my hopes up that high, I was okay with the first no
6463080	6464040	man's sky they put out.
6464040	6467240	Like I didn't think it was going to be like game of the year, but I didn't think it was
6467240	6469720	like as shitty as a lot of people made it out to be.
6469720	6474040	Now, I think it's amazing and a great, you know, comeback story.
6474040	6479160	And honestly, like, you know, with as much bullying and shit as hello games got over
6479160	6483800	the first release of that game, we're just honestly damn lucky that they've stuck with
6483800	6487960	it and really invested so much more in it and made it a better game and a game that
6487960	6489800	I think a lot more people want to check out.
6489800	6494280	And I think it's awesome that we're even getting VR in the first place, but I don't believe
6494280	6497160	this game was really designed for VR.
6497160	6501720	So I think inherently, it's probably not going to be the second coming of VR Jesus
6501720	6502440	or whatever you want to call it.
6502440	6504520	It's not going to be Beat Saber, something like that.
6504520	6506760	That is like a definitive VR app.
6506760	6509320	I think it'll be, but I don't think it'll be bad either.
6509320	6514040	I mean, we'll see on the 14th, but I think it's going to be kind of cool to play a couple
6514040	6514280	times.
6514280	6516440	I think it'll be fun to have that immersion.
6516440	6521880	No man's sky isn't necessarily a frantically placed game unless you're like me and you
6521880	6523880	shoot the wrong aliens and they all start coming for you.
6524680	6527240	But for the most part, it's not that frantic of a game.
6527240	6532840	So I don't expect that VR is going to be a very hard thing to do in No Man's Sky.
6532840	6535400	But I think it'll be neat.
6535400	6538360	Some of the worlds in No Man's Sky are really beautiful.
6538360	6542200	I remember Bobby and I ended up on some planet that was peaceful and it was a really good
6542200	6543800	looking tropical planet.
6543800	6545960	I would love to see that again in VR.
6545960	6547080	I think it's going to be cool.
6547080	6551640	I will probably start over on No Man's Sky for the fifth time when this VR update comes
6551640	6551800	out.
6552520	6553400	I'm excited to see it.
6554280	6557400	Yeah, because I think VR was always planned for it.
6557400	6562600	So I always thought the VR mode is just going to be more like you're just viewing things
6562600	6563160	in VR.
6563160	6566760	I didn't really think it was going to be a major part of the game.
6566760	6570280	The way people are talking online, they feel like they're going to be flying to different
6570280	6574840	planets, hanging out with their friends in their VR living room, watching a VR TV.
6575800	6577720	They got these big high hopes for it.
6577720	6585400	I'm just like, I just hope Hello Games, you know, that they will not learn their lesson
6585400	6588360	because like I said, I don't think there was a lesson for them to learn, but I hope they
6589560	6593960	realize like, okay, we don't want to get the hopes up and we're just going to have to like
6593960	6599240	really deliver on this VR and give them as close to what we think they want as we can
6599240	6599640	do.
6599640	6601400	You know, so hopefully they got that done.
6602120	6604120	I don't pin this one on Hello Games.
6604120	6606840	I think they're just doing the normal level hype.
6607240	6608680	Of course they put out trailers.
6608680	6610600	Of course they put out screenshots and things.
6610600	6611560	That's what you're supposed to do.
6611560	6613640	That's what any game company does about their product.
6613640	6615240	They're proud of what they're doing.
6615240	6620120	So if people end up disappointed in the VR and No Man's Sky, I don't think Hello Games
6620120	6621080	will be the one to blame.
6622040	6622440	Right.
6622440	6622840	Yeah.
6622840	6623160	Yeah.
6623160	6625720	And you were talking about collectibles earlier.
6625720	6628520	I just wanted to say that I know you got another call coming in.
6628520	6629560	Oh no, that's not your other call.
6629560	6635800	Anyway, I actually bought the D&D, the Stranger Things D&D starter kit.
6636520	6637320	And it's really cool.
6637320	6637820	I liked it.
6638280	6642360	Oh yeah, because that's all the rage right now with Stranger Things back on TV and the
6642360	6643960	kids are playing D&D.
6643960	6648040	That is pretty cool, though, that is probably exposing more people to Dungeons and Dragons
6648040	6651800	and making them think, oh yeah, that's a thing I should get into as much as we might tease
6651800	6655320	the fact that like Stranger Things mania is everywhere.
6655320	6659000	You know, it's kind of cool that it's bringing more people into D&D.
6659000	6660040	Yeah, it's deserved.
6660040	6661960	You get five classes.
6661960	6664840	Unfortunately, Max isn't in it.
6664840	6668600	You don't get a Zoomer class, which I was like, how can you not have this Zoomer class
6668600	6669000	in there?
6669000	6670120	But they don't have that.
6670120	6673240	But they have, you know, all the other five kids.
6673240	6677880	You know, Eleven, Mike, Dustin, Lucas.
6677880	6679320	Well, they're all in there.
6679320	6679800	Wait a minute.
6680440	6684040	So it's like a Stranger Things D&D where you're actually playing.
6684040	6685240	I thought it was just a Stranger Things.
6685240	6686360	Yeah, yeah, you're playing that.
6686360	6690920	Yeah, if you remember the original season of Stranger Things, the D&D game that they
6690920	6691480	were playing.
6692040	6693480	You're playing that game.
6693480	6697080	Like you actually have Mike's notebook with his notes.
6697080	6698280	Like he's the DM.
6698280	6698920	Yeah, okay.
6698920	6703800	So not to spoil anything, but you go to that Upside Down and all that stuff.
6703800	6708040	And they give you two Demogorgon figures, which are really cool.
6708040	6709880	Like one is painted, one isn't painted.
6709880	6710440	I don't know why.
6711080	6713720	But yeah, so it's cool.
6713720	6714920	It's only 25 bucks.
6714920	6717240	You get that target a lot of different places.
6717240	6720760	But it's got me back in the DM and role playing again.
6720920	6725080	Like I took a break from it because I really couldn't find a role playing game that I was
6725080	6729000	into because I'm drained out on the fantasy thing.
6729000	6731960	I don't want to do the Wizards and Warlocks and all type of stuff.
6731960	6735320	I was trying to find modern day spy era.
6735320	6740120	And just recently I found the Marvel superhero role playing game.
6740120	6742200	That was like the other game that TSR made.
6742760	6743800	And that one is really cool.
6743800	6746440	If anybody's in the tabletop gaming, you might want to pick up that.
6746440	6747080	And it's free now.
6747080	6747960	You can get it online.
6747960	6748840	It's like a school.
6749720	6750920	Yeah, but it's good game.
6751800	6752520	Yeah, you know, it's good.
6753160	6753800	Good.
6753800	6755320	You know what I used to have back in the day?
6755320	6757080	Like this is when I was still in high school.
6758040	6759400	Street Fighter RPG.
6760360	6761960	I was a fighter to RPG.
6762920	6763480	That's nice.
6764120	6764600	Yeah.
6764600	6766360	And it's better than the angry Joe version, right?
6766360	6768920	Because angry Joe, he's doing like a miniature game of it.
6768920	6774120	And I think it's going to be crap, even I like angry Joe, but I don't trust him with
6774120	6775320	his Kickstarter anyway.
6775320	6775480	Yeah.
6775480	6775880	So, yeah.
6775880	6777320	So try those games.
6777320	6780760	Try the Stranger Things, Dungeons and Dragons, and try the TSR.
6781960	6782440	What was it?
6782440	6783800	Marvel Superheroes, right?
6783800	6784600	You can get online now.
6784600	6788040	You just go to classicmarble.com and they have all the books, all the supplements.
6788040	6789400	You can download them all for free.
6789960	6790680	It's a cool system.
6790680	6791480	It's a simple system.
6791480	6793320	It's not like the D20 system.
6793320	6794760	You're using percentile dice.
6795480	6796040	It's really easy.
6797000	6798680	I just have one thing to say to you.
6800120	6801400	Second edition D and D.
6804040	6805400	I still have all my stuff.
6805400	6806680	I know what my THACO is.
6807480	6809480	Awesome.
6809480	6811320	Or if you just want to migraine play Rifts.
6812520	6813240	All right.
6813240	6815640	My friend, I'm going to let you go, but thanks so much for the call.
6815640	6817720	All right, take care, buddy.
6817720	6819160	VR in the future.
6819160	6819480	All right.
6820360	6820760	See ya.
6821560	6822040	All right.
6822040	6822280	Yeah.
6822280	6823880	Maybe I'll see him in No Man's Sky.
6823880	6824440	Who knows?
6824440	6825160	Anything like that.
6825720	6826360	I love it.
6826360	6826600	Anyway.
6826600	6829320	All that talk about VR Jesus made me think of The Lawnmower Man.
6830040	6830520	How so?
6831080	6834120	Just, I was trying to think of what VR Jesus would be.
6834120	6836440	And all I could think of was The Lawnmower Man.
6836440	6837000	That movie.
6837640	6840280	I haven't seen that in probably since it first came out.
6840280	6841080	In the theater.
6841080	6842680	And that was the last time I saw it.
6842680	6843160	Oh, wow.
6844280	6845320	I just don't remember it.
6845320	6846040	Weird as fuck.
6846040	6846760	Yeah, it was weird.
6847640	6850840	90s interpretations of computer culture are always great.
6850840	6854760	Like The Net starring Sandra Bullock, or of course the movie Hackers.
6854760	6857640	Like these are hilarious things to go back and watch.
6857640	6861560	Heck, even the original Jurassic Park kind of had some funny computer stuff in it.
6861560	6861880	You know?
6863640	6865080	You didn't say the magic word.
6867800	6868200	Anyway.
6868840	6869240	All right.
6869240	6870120	That's it for calls.
6870120	6871880	We didn't have anything else on the line.
6871880	6873640	So we're about to wrap up.
6873640	6877640	If there's no other last minute stories, I guess we're moving to wrap up for the night.
6877640	6880840	But we will be back next week, except for Dark Sakura, sadly.
6880840	6884600	But well, not too sad for us, but not that sad.
6884600	6889080	Maybe he'll sing Jurassic Park is frightening in the dark.
6889080	6890440	Are you doing meet and greet again or no?
6890440	6891320	Because you already did that.
6891320	6893880	Yeah, we did that for our 10th anniversary.
6894440	6898760	So we're thinking next year of putting the money aside and going to Disney World.
6899560	6900680	That'll be fun.
6900680	6902520	I've never been to Disney World and I really want to go.
6902520	6904600	But we're doing we're doing the Star Trek Cruise next year.
6905320	6907800	Thanks to I almost said it.
6907800	6910040	I always call him by his last name and I got to stop doing that.
6910040	6914280	But thanks to Grandpa or Captain Matt from Starboard Power Company.
6915320	6918040	We're going on that cruise and they just announced over the weekend because there's
6918040	6920600	been a big Star Trek convention going on in Las Vegas this weekend, too.
6920600	6922040	They just announced Jerry Ryan.
6922280	6923400	Sarah was there.
6923400	6923880	That's right.
6923880	6924840	Tara was there.
6924840	6925000	Yeah.
6925000	6926440	But Jerry Ryan is going to be on the cruise.
6926440	6929080	So trailer I did.
6929080	6929720	Oh, my God.
6929720	6930920	It looks so good.
6930920	6931640	Right.
6931640	6932360	I'm so far behind.
6932360	6934200	I still haven't watched season two of Discovery.
6934200	6938680	And I think I think I had the big twist spoiled for me and I'm a little irritated, but I'm
6938680	6939400	still going to watch it.
6940120	6941640	I haven't watched any Discovery.
6941640	6948360	But I mean, the thing is, is that I had read like all of the like the big end book with
6948360	6949560	the Borg and all that.
6949640	6955800	And so part of my brain's going like thinking of book continuity and I'll go, no, no, no,
6955800	6955960	no.
6955960	6960280	Think different, not book, because I read through that going through the Deep Space
6960280	6962280	Nine books because I love the Deep Space Nine books.
6962920	6963160	Yeah.
6963720	6966680	DS9 is the best Star Trek series and you're all wrong if you think otherwise.
6968680	6972920	I'm near and dear to Voyager, but that's just because I think that's just more like an emotional
6972920	6974920	connection, not based in like fact.
6974920	6975560	Do you know what I mean?
6976200	6976840	Yeah.
6976840	6986360	But, you know, we would call Cisco a captain named Hawk because Avery Brooks was in A Man
6986360	6986840	Called Hawk.
6987960	6990360	So Questbuster says DS9 is great.
6990360	6992600	Under the Pale Moonlight is one of my favorite episodes.
6993640	6994520	Such a good episode.
6994520	6995480	You're in good company.
6995480	6997000	It's a fake.
6997000	6999240	Anyway, we'll be back next week.
6999240	7002520	Loki and I'll be back next week to entertain you with the week in gaming news.
7002520	7004040	We hope you guys will all be here too.
7004040	7007720	Bobby Blackall will be back next week live at Twitch to talk about Gen Con.
7007720	7008920	So we're going to have a good old time.
7009960	7013080	Whether you're here or not, maybe we'll get treated to a phone call, depending on how
7013080	7013880	late the concert runs.
7015160	7017080	Anyway, well, Dark Soccer.
7017080	7021000	Oh, before we get to the final thoughts, as I always say towards the end of the show,
7021000	7022520	hey, tell a friend or two about the show.
7022520	7023560	Help us spread the word.
7023560	7027560	We are the show where every gamer has a voice, but only if the voices are here to put out
7027560	7028280	over the air.
7028280	7031320	So yeah, be sure to bring those voices to us.
7031320	7035080	A nice five star review on a place like iTunes or wherever you found this podcast.
7035080	7040200	That goes a long way and also really, really helps the hosts on Twitch.
7040200	7043880	Thank you so much to everybody that's put VOG Network in your auto host list.
7044760	7047240	Dark Soccer, do you want to start us off with final thoughts tonight?
7047960	7049480	Stop killing people, you twat.
7051240	7055960	My final thought tonight would be I've really missed streaming on my personal channel,
7055960	7059720	but with the Survivor game wrapping up, either I'll get voted out this week or it'll be done
7059720	7060280	on Sunday.
7060920	7064840	Either way, I should be back to streaming very soon because I want to make sure I build that
7064840	7069000	up in advance of Dragon Con with all the streaming stuff that's going to be happening at Dragon
7069000	7069240	Con.
7069240	7070360	I'm really excited about that.
7071000	7072840	Loki, last but not least, your final thoughts?
7072840	7075240	I guess I have a course the right in Unity.
7078120	7079160	Good luck.
7079160	7079880	Good luck.
7079880	7081480	We'll be back in seven days.
7081480	7085000	Tune in then to find out if Loki was successful in doing any coursing.
7085000	7087240	Oh yeah, like we'll know by next week.
7087240	7087880	Come on.
7087880	7088360	Yeah, right.
7088360	7089240	Let's be honest here.
7089640	7090680	Have a good week, everybody.
7090680	7091320	Happy gaming.
7091320	7091800	Good night.
7119240	7119800	True.
7122600	7123800	See you next week.
7149240	7150380	Bye.
