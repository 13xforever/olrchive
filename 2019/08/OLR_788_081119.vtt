Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
With your hosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

00:14.000 --> 00:21.000
This week a big box store chain cuts back on gaming displays while still selling lethal weapons one aisle away from bikes and children's toys. Truly the arbiter of morality.

00:21.000 --> 00:27.000
This is just one story we've heard too many times before. Stay tuned for the rest of the week's gaming news starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:28.000 --> 00:32.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:32.000 --> 00:38.000
Hello my friends out there on the internet. Welcome back to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:38.000 --> 00:43.000
It is episode number 788 for this August the 11th of 2019.

00:43.000 --> 00:47.000
My name is Rob Roberts and joining me here in studio live at Twitch TV.

00:47.000 --> 00:51.000
Twitch TV slash VOG Network. The voice of Geeks Network.

00:51.000 --> 00:54.000
Joining me here in studio is Techmaster Loki.

00:54.000 --> 01:03.000
Yes, it's me. The guy that's shutting down all the background processes because I neglected to bring my power adapter for my laptop.

01:03.000 --> 01:04.000
You're gonna have to vamp with the camera tonight.

01:04.000 --> 01:08.000
It literally is gonna eat the battery in like no time flat.

01:08.000 --> 01:15.000
You guys don't know like how much Loki multitasks. Well, you probably do know if you watch the show before you can usually see his head buried in a laptop.

01:15.000 --> 01:19.000
And you know, he's on task. It's not like you're sitting there watching porn.

01:19.000 --> 01:24.000
But you're, I don't think, but you know, you're looking at stories, last minute stories, things related to gaming.

01:24.000 --> 01:29.000
Or I've seen you working on your game. Like I feel like you get more work done on your game here at OLR.

01:29.000 --> 01:31.000
No, I don't work on it here.

01:31.000 --> 01:36.000
Yeah, crazy. So yeah, so unfortunately your laptop battery seems to be dying.

01:36.000 --> 01:42.000
Yeah, it's because I was stupid and it's because my kids were distracting me when I was packing up everything before I came over here.

01:42.000 --> 01:48.000
So I did unplug it and wrap it up and set it down and then left. So, oh well.

01:48.000 --> 01:51.000
Things happen sometimes. It's okay. So you're gonna try your best to get through the show.

01:51.000 --> 01:52.000
Got my phone.

01:52.000 --> 01:55.000
Yeah, you have the good old phone back up. We can find you a charger for that if need be.

01:55.000 --> 02:02.000
Why haven't I introduced Dark Sakura? She's, we adore her. She's still very much a part of OLR, just not tonight.

02:02.000 --> 02:06.000
So Dark Sakura's not with us tonight. She is at a Weird Al Yankovic concert.

02:06.000 --> 02:07.000
Admitting word crimes.

02:07.000 --> 02:12.000
Here in town. Weird Al Yankovic is in town. I'm kind of jealous. I would have liked to have gone to that.

02:12.000 --> 02:17.000
I had no idea that it was happening tonight. But a fine excuse to miss OLR, honestly.

02:17.000 --> 02:20.000
Like, I can't be mad. Like, I almost missed this show for Carly Rae Jepsen.

02:20.000 --> 02:23.000
So it's only fair that she misses the show for Weird Al Yankovic. It's fine.

02:23.000 --> 02:26.000
So we'll be back, or she will be back next week.

02:26.000 --> 02:31.000
But we're here with you guys tonight in studio over at, again, Twitch TV slash vlog network,

02:31.000 --> 02:38.000
where we do tape live every Sunday night at about six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

02:38.000 --> 02:43.000
Yeah. So you guys can join us in chat there. Bobby Black Wolf points out, actually,

02:43.000 --> 02:49.000
he's probably performing word crimes right now. I've missed a show for Weird Al a few months back.

02:49.000 --> 02:50.000
It's totally acceptable.

02:50.000 --> 02:55.000
At Rum Jump Stomp saying Weird Al is the best concert I've ever been to.

02:55.000 --> 02:58.000
I haven't seen Weird Al in concert. I feel like I'm missing out.

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
I have not either. And someday, maybe.

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
Who have I seen? I've seen a lot of good shows this year.

03:02.000 --> 03:07.000
I mean, you know, I love my pop diva queens. So, you know, Carly Rae Jepsen was an amazing show, if you're into that.

03:07.000 --> 03:11.000
I saw Robin earlier this year, which was phenomenal.

03:11.000 --> 03:15.000
I've had the fortune of seeing some good concerts this year. So, yeah, I don't know.

03:15.000 --> 03:21.000
I don't know if I've been to a lot of bad concerts. I've seen bad bands at concerts,

03:21.000 --> 03:24.000
but I haven't seen just a lot of straight up bad concerts. Like, I've seen bad openers.

03:24.000 --> 03:27.000
I can't think of the last concert I actually went to.

03:27.000 --> 03:30.000
What about video game related concerts? How about this site?

03:30.000 --> 03:33.000
And I'll ask you guys in chat, what video game concerts have you been to?

03:33.000 --> 03:37.000
Well, the only one I went to is that Final Fantasy one, one year, I think.

03:37.000 --> 03:40.000
Yeah. I'm pretty sure I've told this story on the show before.

03:40.000 --> 03:44.000
And in fact, it might have been less than a month ago, but Alan and I, my husband Alan and I,

03:44.000 --> 03:48.000
met in person for the first time at Video Games Live in Oakland,

03:48.000 --> 03:53.000
the Tommy Tallarico show that travels around and, you know, has been everywhere in the past few years.

03:53.000 --> 03:57.000
That was actually, we knew each other online on a site called LiveJournal for years and years,

03:57.000 --> 04:00.000
but we actually met for the first time in person at a video game concert.

04:00.000 --> 04:06.000
So, video games are part of the reason I'm in the home situation I'm in today, which is pretty cool.

04:06.000 --> 04:13.000
And I would say, though, recently one concert I remember going to that I loved was when I was,

04:13.000 --> 04:16.000
it was MAGFest, because MAGFest is, right, music and games.

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
I had a great time at MAGFest a couple of years I went.

04:18.000 --> 04:23.000
And one of the years I went, they actually had somebody playing the game,

04:23.000 --> 04:26.000
or there's some buddies, they pass it off every now and then,

04:26.000 --> 04:29.000
but they were playing the game Journey, right?

04:29.000 --> 04:34.000
Not about the 80s band, but the more recent artistic game for the PlayStation 3 and 4,

04:35.000 --> 04:39.000
Journey, they were playing that with a live orchestra playing the music.

04:39.000 --> 04:40.000
Oh, that's cool.

04:40.000 --> 04:43.000
And it was, to quote a Keanu Reeves term, breathtaking.

04:43.000 --> 04:48.000
So, it really was. There's no other word to describe it. It was an amazing concert. I love that.

04:48.000 --> 04:49.000
So, yeah.

04:49.000 --> 04:55.000
ActDef saying, my last video game concert was Capcom Live quite a few years ago.

04:55.000 --> 04:59.000
Bobby Blackwolf saying, shame it's the first weekend in January regarding MAGFest.

04:59.000 --> 05:03.000
Yeah, that timing, you know, I just know I won't be able to get back to MAGFest for a couple of years.

05:03.000 --> 05:04.000
I'd love to go back.

05:04.000 --> 05:09.000
Well, there's also MAGWest, which, gosh, if MAGWest wasn't this weekend,

05:09.000 --> 05:14.000
then it's happening really soon because MAGWest, it was the week before Dragon Con,

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
but I think it's like two weeks before.

05:16.000 --> 05:18.000
It's like either this weekend or next weekend. It's coming up real soon.

05:18.000 --> 05:23.000
I always mean to get out there, but it's just, yeah, summer, a lot of busy weekends in the summer,

05:23.000 --> 05:26.000
I usually end up with other commitments and so forth.

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
So, that happens.

05:28.000 --> 05:32.000
So, I would love to see, you know, there's a lot of good musical performances at Dragon Con.

05:32.000 --> 05:35.000
I don't remember if there's a lot of video game related things directly

05:35.000 --> 05:38.000
because Dragon Con is more of a general nerd convention,

05:38.000 --> 05:41.000
but I'm sure there's video game influence stuff.

05:41.000 --> 05:44.000
I just haven't made my way down the halls to find yet.

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
So, but I'll talk more about Dragon Con in a little bit.

05:46.000 --> 05:49.000
But first, we're going to get into tonight's kickoff topic.

05:49.000 --> 05:53.000
So, some video game news, big, big change going on in the industry.

05:53.000 --> 05:54.000
This is pretty huge.

05:54.000 --> 05:57.000
Yeah, they're taking hints from all the regulation that's coming down the pipeline.

05:58.000 --> 06:02.000
Apparently, the ESA made a statement saying that, hey, guess what?

06:02.000 --> 06:06.000
Microsoft's Nintendo and Sony, they've all agreed on one thing,

06:06.000 --> 06:09.000
and that is that they're going to make sure that on their platforms,

06:09.000 --> 06:12.000
you know what the odds are for random loot boxes.

06:12.000 --> 06:17.000
So, you'll actually be able to see what the odds are for specific games

06:17.000 --> 06:22.000
and what they're going to feature and the rarities of different items

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
that you may get and probabilities and whatnot.

06:24.000 --> 06:30.000
So, that's going to apply to new games and game updates that add loot box features,

06:30.000 --> 06:34.000
and it would require the disclosure of the relative rarity or probabilities.

06:35.000 --> 06:40.000
Now, I don't want to be that guy, but I'm going to be that guy,

06:40.000 --> 06:43.000
because I feel like when we talked about loot boxes here on OLR,

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
when this controversy was breaking,

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
when it was really hitting a fever pitch around the legislation,

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
I want to say about six weeks ago,

06:49.000 --> 06:52.000
when it looked like it might actually make its way to Congress and so forth,

06:52.000 --> 06:55.000
I want to say that I said, you know who could fix this problem,

06:55.000 --> 06:59.000
and you know who could stop this before it goes to the government

06:59.000 --> 07:01.000
and the government makes the wrong decision,

07:01.000 --> 07:05.000
because no matter where you are politically, I'm pretty sure we can all agree,

07:05.000 --> 07:08.000
the government would have made the wrong decision on this.

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
At least this government.

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
Yeah, at least this government.

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
Maybe other governments would have done better.

07:14.000 --> 07:18.000
But anyway, I believe I said, who could fix this?

07:18.000 --> 07:21.000
Microsoft could fix this. Nintendo could fix this. Sony could fix this.

07:21.000 --> 07:25.000
Now, the gag I didn't predict was that they would all do it together.

07:25.000 --> 07:28.000
That's a gag. I did not see that one coming.

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
But I thought, oh, I kind of figured,

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
I thought Microsoft would be the first,

07:32.000 --> 07:35.000
just because they do have involvement on PC and so forth,

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
that they would do something on their marketplace,

07:37.000 --> 07:39.000
because I remember making the joke,

07:39.000 --> 07:42.000
Nintendo would be last to the table, because hello, Nintendo went online.

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
So I remember this topic coming up.

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
But it is pretty, you know, it's funny,

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
because I also feel like that's been a running theme,

07:48.000 --> 07:52.000
is that, you know, all these game companies kind of working together

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
for greater good all of a sudden, right?

07:54.000 --> 07:57.000
We had a story just a few weeks ago about Sony and Microsoft

07:57.000 --> 08:01.000
teaming up on cloud gaming in some regard, right?

08:01.000 --> 08:04.000
So is the smoosh cameo actually happening on the stream?

08:04.000 --> 08:05.000
You can see his head.

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
Just a little bit. Maybe if you let him walk in a little more.

08:07.000 --> 08:09.000
He might hop up on that table. Who knows?

08:09.000 --> 08:12.000
But anyway, not to distract too much from our podcast listeners,

08:12.000 --> 08:15.000
but you know a smoosh cameo is always going to distract us here on OilOck.

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
Why did you stop petting me?

08:17.000 --> 08:23.000
So anyway, it's really something that they've all kind of banded together in a way.

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
So there was the cloud gaming thing, but now there's this.

08:25.000 --> 08:31.000
All three have come together to essentially end the loop box.

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
I mean, I don't know. Would you say this is the end?

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
Like, where do we go from here?

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
It's not the end. It's just now they're like, well, look, see,

08:37.000 --> 08:41.000
we're being transparent about the randomization on it.

08:41.000 --> 08:46.000
So that's why it's okay. See, we're being good.

08:46.000 --> 08:47.000
Yeah, I gotcha.

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
It's not gambling, except it is.

08:49.000 --> 08:54.000
Yeah. Well, but now it's less gambling now that you know the odds up front.

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
So there you go.

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
There you go. Hey, this is the moment you've been waiting for.

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
Look at that.

09:00.000 --> 09:04.000
He is full on taking over now that Jamie's not here.

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
So center stage is going to clean himself right there.

09:06.000 --> 09:10.000
Usually, her stuff is all up on this table here,

09:10.000 --> 09:14.000
but Mr. Smoosh has just decided to make it its home tonight.

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
I can't wait till we get into gaming weeks,

09:16.000 --> 09:20.000
because this fucking cat has done so much this week with gaming.

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
But anyway, I'll get to it. I'll get to it.

09:22.000 --> 09:29.000
So anyway, but yeah, so it's interesting that all three have banded together.

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
But you don't think this is the end?

09:31.000 --> 09:32.000
No, it's never the end.

09:32.000 --> 09:33.000
It's not the end.

09:33.000 --> 09:34.000
It's too much money to be the end.

09:34.000 --> 09:35.000
Where do we go from here?

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
Do we think the amount of loop boxes will decrease

09:37.000 --> 09:40.000
because we're seeing these companies take a stand?

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
Does this make it get bigger or what?

09:42.000 --> 09:45.000
I think it's just not going to really affect anything.

09:45.000 --> 09:48.000
I think it's just now making it more acceptable in the eyes of the publishers.

09:48.000 --> 09:51.000
It's like because, oh hey, but we're letting you know what the odds are.

09:51.000 --> 09:55.000
So you're making a decision to buy that.

09:55.000 --> 09:56.000
You know what the odds are.

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
You're making the decision to do that.

09:58.000 --> 09:59.000
Right.

09:59.000 --> 10:01.000
Do you think more games adopt loop boxes,

10:01.000 --> 10:04.000
or do you think we see this continued stepping back trend?

10:04.000 --> 10:07.000
Because I think there's a quick little follow-up on this, right?

10:07.000 --> 10:09.000
I think there's a fine line.

10:09.000 --> 10:12.000
It's the same offenders that keep doing this,

10:12.000 --> 10:17.000
and it's putting loop boxes in games that really don't need to have them

10:17.000 --> 10:18.000
or putting them in there after the fact,

10:18.000 --> 10:22.000
like Activision adding them to Crash Team Racing

10:22.000 --> 10:23.000
after the game's been reviewed.

10:23.000 --> 10:26.000
It's like, oh yeah, now we put it in there.

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
Ha, you already reviewed the game.

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
It's too late now.

10:30.000 --> 10:31.000
You bought the game.

10:31.000 --> 10:32.000
Now they're in there.

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
So I don't know.

10:34.000 --> 10:37.000
But we do have a story about one game getting rid of loop boxes, right?

10:37.000 --> 10:38.000
This is true, yes.

10:38.000 --> 10:41.000
So Rocket League is getting rid of loop boxes.

10:41.000 --> 10:42.000
That's right.

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
So they're going the route because, you may remember,

10:44.000 --> 10:47.000
the parent company of Rocket League did get purchased by Epic Games,

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
so now they're taking their loop boxes

10:49.000 --> 10:55.000
and actually doing a kind of loop system that's similar to Fortnite

10:55.000 --> 11:00.000
in the sense that you'll kind of have a path laid out of,

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
like, here's the stuff you're going to unlock,

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
kind of like their season passes that they're going to have,

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
or they don't call them season passes.

11:06.000 --> 11:12.000
They call them, like, battle passes or, like, their seasons that they have.

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
So that's how they're doing it.

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
So there's going to be transparency there,

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
but it's not going to be random loop boxes.

11:18.000 --> 11:22.000
Now RumJumpStomp in our chat over at twitch.tv slash vognetwork says,

11:22.000 --> 11:26.000
a lot of people are really angry about Rocket League removing crates

11:26.000 --> 11:29.000
because of the effect it will have on the trading economy.

11:32.000 --> 11:35.000
Oh, well, that's just, you know, it's for the great.

11:35.000 --> 11:38.000
It's for the greater good that these things are gone.

11:38.000 --> 11:39.000
Too bad for your economy.

11:39.000 --> 11:42.000
I don't know, it's not a game I have really a stake in, so, yeah.

11:42.000 --> 11:45.000
No, but I mean, if it was, let's, you know, this could be happening in any game.

11:45.000 --> 11:46.000
You know what, it doesn't matter.

11:46.000 --> 11:49.000
Whatever someone does, it's going to offend somebody.

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
So, what are you going to do?

11:51.000 --> 11:54.000
Well, I think it's going to be interesting to see how this plays out from here.

11:54.000 --> 11:57.000
I do think the trend of removing loop boxes,

11:57.000 --> 12:01.000
I mean, you've seen Fortnite kind of do the more x-ray thing,

12:01.000 --> 12:03.000
so it's like a different, it's not so much like the gambling mechanic

12:03.000 --> 12:04.000
as it is you know what you're buying up front.

12:04.000 --> 12:07.000
Like those types of like bundle packs and things of that nature,

12:07.000 --> 12:08.000
they're never going to go away.

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
But I think the randomization,

12:10.000 --> 12:13.000
the things that could even have that appearance of gambling,

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
you know, now that we know the odds and so forth,

12:15.000 --> 12:18.000
I just feel like these things are going to take a downward trend overall.

12:18.000 --> 12:21.000
Well, and with the Fortnite stuff, I mean, at least that,

12:21.000 --> 12:24.000
with their like battle passes or whatever they call them,

12:24.000 --> 12:30.000
you can, if you play the game enough or you can play it well enough,

12:30.000 --> 12:33.000
you can actually earn enough credits to buy it with in-game money

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
each time and kind of keep that rolling.

12:35.000 --> 12:39.000
So I think that's kind of cool that you can do that.

12:39.000 --> 12:40.000
Yeah.

12:40.000 --> 12:43.000
Don't know if they'll have something similar with Rocket League,

12:43.000 --> 12:44.000
but we'll see.

12:44.000 --> 12:45.000
We'll see, indeed.

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
Some other comments from chat.

12:47.000 --> 12:51.000
Spyro Jonathan says, Loki is so right about that with CTR Nitro Fueled

12:51.000 --> 12:54.000
and the microtransactions were not ever advertised to be in the game

12:54.000 --> 12:55.000
when it was released.

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
That does kind of make it feel right.

12:57.000 --> 12:58.000
Well, it's Activision though.

12:58.000 --> 13:01.000
I mean, Modern Warfare, the game that they put out,

13:01.000 --> 13:04.000
it's a remaster, let's throw some of that shit in there

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
because that's what people want.

13:06.000 --> 13:09.000
They're just going to do it because they make money off of it

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
and you'll bitch and moan about it,

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
but in the end, people buy them and they make money off of it,

13:13.000 --> 13:14.000
so they don't care.

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
Interesting comment from Questbuster.

13:16.000 --> 13:19.000
Questbuster says, reminds me when Valve accidentally crashed

13:19.000 --> 13:23.000
their Team Fortress 2 rare hat economy by accidentally making

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
certain ones drop like crazy with the patch.

13:25.000 --> 13:27.000
Yeah, that was recently.

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
Yeah, and that is interesting when like, you know,

13:29.000 --> 13:33.000
a bug or something happens there that kind of shoots the economy in the foot.

13:33.000 --> 13:34.000
It's kind of interesting.

13:34.000 --> 13:38.000
Well, that economy is also what's getting legislature.

13:38.000 --> 13:43.000
You know, if you have random loot boxes and there's a monetary value

13:43.000 --> 13:46.000
associated with that loot that you have,

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
that's a problem because that'd be gambling.

13:50.000 --> 13:53.000
Kaijuto in chat says, Rocket League used to have a slot machine

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
like Roll when you opened a loot box.

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
They took it out like months ago, so they've been working on removing

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
the random loot stuff before this news.

13:59.000 --> 14:01.000
Oh yeah, no, I don't think like this.

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
Yeah, it's more just kind of a coincidence in timing.

14:03.000 --> 14:07.000
It's one of those timing things where I think together we see that loot boxes,

14:07.000 --> 14:12.000
you know, it's changing drastically and it's, I think, in large part

14:12.000 --> 14:15.000
because of, good job EA and Battlefront 2.

14:15.000 --> 14:18.000
Like, if you can point at a reason and go,

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
that was the day that loot boxes died.

14:20.000 --> 14:26.000
That game really started everybody getting pissed off at those.

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
EA is their own worst enemy.

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
Because when it was Mass Effect 3 and the type of thing they did there,

14:30.000 --> 14:34.000
I remember the early days, that didn't seem so agitating, I think.

14:34.000 --> 14:37.000
But I think that was because it really wasn't hard to earn enough

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
in-game currency to open your own loot boxes.

14:39.000 --> 14:42.000
It was just that money was for the impatient, you know what I mean?

14:42.000 --> 14:45.000
So, but then, you know, more companies realized,

14:45.000 --> 14:46.000
oh, people will pay more money.

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
And then, oh, you're paying money on a $60 game.

14:48.000 --> 14:51.000
Let's do more money on top of that to play as Darth Vader.

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
You know, so anyway.

14:53.000 --> 14:54.000
Yeah.

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
All right. Well, let's move on.

14:56.000 --> 15:00.000
We'll see what develops in the coming weeks with this whole loot box thing.

15:00.000 --> 15:03.000
But this time next year, at least we're going to know all the odds on it.

15:03.000 --> 15:07.000
I will say one game that, you know, I play a bit of is Overwatch.

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
And, you know, that game is a huge game on loot boxes.

15:09.000 --> 15:13.000
Now, they're all cosmetics, so I think Blizzard usually tends to dodge

15:13.000 --> 15:17.000
the bullets when it comes to this discussion in the industry about loot boxes

15:17.000 --> 15:22.000
because, you know, the balance of Blizzard's game is not impacted by the loot boxes in it.

15:22.000 --> 15:25.000
But it is going to be interesting to see a game of that caliber

15:25.000 --> 15:27.000
because they said Blizzard was in on this, right?

15:27.000 --> 15:31.000
So they're going to end up disclosing the percentage of, you know,

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
if you get a gold or a purple or what have you.

15:33.000 --> 15:34.000
So it'd be very interesting.

15:34.000 --> 15:35.000
Yeah.

15:35.000 --> 15:36.000
All right. Anyway.

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
Well, let's move on and talk about our gaming weeks

15:38.000 --> 15:42.000
and the types of video games or other games, as the case may be, I'll get into,

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
that we have been playing this week. So, Loki.

15:44.000 --> 15:48.000
So I've been playing more Pokemon Go because the reason I haven't had my gotcha

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
for the few weeks is I couldn't find the charging cable for it

15:50.000 --> 15:54.000
for like the longest time. And so I finally found it and it's charged

15:54.000 --> 15:55.000
and now I'm wearing it.

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
So I've been playing a little bit of Pokemon Go

15:57.000 --> 16:00.000
and I did one of the Team Rocket fights or whatever

16:00.000 --> 16:04.000
and then I couldn't catch the piece of crap, you know, Charmander

16:04.000 --> 16:05.000
or whatever they wanted me to catch after that.

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
So that was a little annoying.

16:08.000 --> 16:09.000
What else?

16:10.000 --> 16:13.000
I played a little bit of the Jurassic Park arcade game

16:13.000 --> 16:18.000
because I was in arcade because we went to play more laser tag at yet another place.

16:18.000 --> 16:21.000
So actually I went back to an old stomping ground that we used to go to,

16:21.000 --> 16:24.000
Country Club Lanes, where they used to have 5th Mix back in the day

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
and we used to play it from like midnight to three in the morning.

16:27.000 --> 16:29.000
Man, DDR 5th Mix was one of the best soundtracks.

16:29.000 --> 16:30.000
It was great.

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
That techno remix of the Neverending Story.

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
Now that arcade is full of just the biggest,

16:34.000 --> 16:37.000
just the same game to see at every goddamn arcade.

16:37.000 --> 16:41.000
So Jurassic Park, the ride, our Jurassic Park game they had there was pretty cool.

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
It was a little bit different of a cabinet because they have,

16:43.000 --> 16:45.000
it actually, the seat moved when you're playing the game.

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
So it was a little bit more enhanced.

16:47.000 --> 16:50.000
But it's just, it's such a, it's such a sign like,

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
what happened to all this?

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
Sorry, but speaking of dance games, quick tangent,

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
I'm sure you, I think I saw you post about that video.

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
So there was like a tournament at round one in the Bay Area.

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
Yes, the night motion.

17:00.000 --> 17:03.000
Yeah, they did a dance rush stardom tournament

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
and that routine with the couple that was,

17:05.000 --> 17:06.000
Awesome.

17:06.000 --> 17:09.000
Darted Seer, somebody can you find that video and link it in our chat?

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
Cause I know you have to know what I'm talking about.

17:11.000 --> 17:12.000
It's in my Twitter.

17:12.000 --> 17:13.000
But there's, oh yeah, it's on your Twitter feed.

17:13.000 --> 17:14.000
That's right.

17:15.000 --> 17:18.000
But, um, that routine of that, that couple and what they were doing,

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
I get like, I don't totally understand.

17:20.000 --> 17:23.000
Dance rush was so weird for me to say, cause I was, I used to love,

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
but I still do love Bawani. It has a place.

17:25.000 --> 17:28.000
I would love to have one of those machines, but I would love to have one.

17:28.000 --> 17:31.000
But like watching them do that routine, that was unreal.

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
That was amazing. Props to those guys.

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
I don't even know their names, but props to them.

17:35.000 --> 17:38.000
That was certainly from Sacramento too. Shut up. Really? Yeah.

17:38.000 --> 17:41.000
Should get them on the show. What the hell are we thinking?

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
Loki, what are we doing with our lives?

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
All right, no, we need to get them on the show at some point.

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
Open invite if you guys are out there. Yeah.

17:47.000 --> 17:48.000
So yeah, that's cool.

17:48.000 --> 17:52.000
So yeah. So, uh, now I have played at all of the laser tag places,

17:52.000 --> 17:55.000
except for one in Elk Grove, um, that are in the Sacramento area.

17:55.000 --> 17:59.000
And so we actually played laser X today because we had gone to that arcade

17:59.000 --> 18:02.000
for so many times and laser X has been there since as long as I can remember.

18:02.000 --> 18:03.000
Long time. Long time.

18:03.000 --> 18:06.000
I think they've updated it since we were going there.

18:06.000 --> 18:10.000
But, um, so I've actually played that system before at this other place

18:10.000 --> 18:14.000
in Roseville, but they have, it's like slightly older. Um, it was okay.

18:14.000 --> 18:19.000
I don't really like it too much. Um, so then we went back to the usual one.

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
We go to jazz tag and I played a game there.

18:21.000 --> 18:25.000
I've just feels more like keys are to me. Whereas the, um,

18:25.000 --> 18:29.000
the zone laser tech system, Helios one that they've got over there.

18:29.000 --> 18:34.000
It's just, it's just all of it's very like kind of cheap feeling it.

18:34.000 --> 18:38.000
The packs feel very cheap. The sound effects sound really shitty.

18:38.000 --> 18:41.000
This the way that like, it doesn't seem very accurate.

18:41.000 --> 18:43.000
It's just all of it feels really cheap,

18:43.000 --> 18:46.000
but they just had an international tournament like in the Netherlands,

18:46.000 --> 18:50.000
just not too long ago, like very recent for zone.

18:50.000 --> 18:54.000
So it's very popular out there, but I don't know. Um, so yeah,

18:54.000 --> 18:58.000
so that's pretty much is just laser tag and Pokemon go.

18:58.000 --> 19:02.000
I'm working on game dev stuff cause I've been actually doing that this week.

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
All right. So my gaming week,

19:04.000 --> 19:07.000
so I've been talking for several weeks about fakie survivor, right?

19:07.000 --> 19:10.000
And the fake survivor game I've been playing with that started with 22

19:10.000 --> 19:14.000
people. Um, so that survivor game was actually supposed to end tonight.

19:14.000 --> 19:15.000
Tonight was supposed to be the last night.

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
It was going to be the final tribal council and all that stuff.

19:17.000 --> 19:19.000
They couldn't do it tonight. You know why?

19:19.000 --> 19:23.000
Cause I got too far in the game and I have this show as a commitment.

19:23.000 --> 19:26.000
So they actually had to bump it to Monday night. I think one of the other,

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
one of the other girls that got really far also had some scheduling

19:28.000 --> 19:32.000
problems. I can't really take all the credit. Um, but uh, yeah,

19:32.000 --> 19:36.000
so they actually it's ending tomorrow. And um, so, you know, last,

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
I think the last update I gave you guys, I was in the final six, right? Yeah.

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
So a lot happened. Okay.

19:40.000 --> 19:43.000
I found a hidden immunity idol and I knew it on the last episode,

19:43.000 --> 19:44.000
but I couldn't say anything about it.

19:44.000 --> 19:47.000
Cause I don't know who's watching played the hidden immunity idol at final

19:47.000 --> 19:50.000
six erased three votes that were for me,

19:50.000 --> 19:54.000
sent the other person home that got three votes on them during the immunity

19:54.000 --> 19:55.000
challenge, which involved,

19:55.000 --> 19:59.000
I had to have my camera on the floor because we had a water bottle in a sock

19:59.000 --> 20:03.000
that we had to spin around a tower of solo cups and keep it going as long as

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
possible. I know it sounds ridiculous, but it's based on a real challenge.

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
Again, that was on the show. It's just using 99 cent clearance store props

20:08.000 --> 20:11.000
instead of the stuff you'd see on CBS. So here's the hilarious thing.

20:11.000 --> 20:14.000
So while the camera is on the floor and I'm doing this, um,

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
probably about 45 minutes into the challenge,

20:16.000 --> 20:20.000
Mr. Smoosh comes in the room and Mr. Smoosh, I shit you not.

20:20.000 --> 20:24.000
He walks into the frame and he like stares because he sees my phone.

20:24.000 --> 20:27.000
I'm on Skype. He sees all the other people doing the challenge and he's like,

20:27.000 --> 20:30.000
what's going on? What's going on? He walks right up to my phone,

20:30.000 --> 20:34.000
knocks my phone on the ground and then the chaos knocks my tower over.

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
So Mr. Smoosh eliminated me from that final six challenge,

20:36.000 --> 20:39.000
which is why I had to basically play the hidden immunity idol to save myself.

20:39.000 --> 20:45.000
So anyway, um, yeah, that was Mr. Smoosh's little stardom this week.

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
So now he's doing this during OLR. He's like,

20:47.000 --> 20:50.000
I want to be like dad and be on camera all the time. So that was that.

20:50.000 --> 20:55.000
Anyway, um, long story short, the final immunity challenge was today.

20:55.000 --> 20:58.000
I was still in it. Three people left,

20:58.000 --> 21:03.000
did the final immunity challenge and I won the final immunity challenge

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
and I got to choose who to take to the final two.

21:05.000 --> 21:09.000
So I am in the final two of the game and the final tribal councils tomorrow.

21:09.000 --> 21:12.000
The hosts really want me to put it on my Twitter to see if some of you will

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
go watch because they want to recruit for next season.

21:14.000 --> 21:18.000
So I will put it on Twitter so you guys can watch me win or lose.

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
Like I don't know what's going to happen, but I've had a lot of fun.

21:20.000 --> 21:24.000
I met a lot of great people and had a real emotional roller coaster.

21:24.000 --> 21:25.000
Like I'm not going to lie.

21:25.000 --> 21:28.000
I lost it when I won that immunity challenge because it was something I

21:28.000 --> 21:31.000
never expected to win because it was very physical in nature.

21:31.000 --> 21:33.000
Do you guys want to see what I had to do? You ready to,

21:33.000 --> 21:36.000
you want to see the final challenge? Here we go Twitch. All right.

21:36.000 --> 21:37.000
So apologies to the podcasters.

21:37.000 --> 21:41.000
I'm going to have Loki narrate what I'm doing and try to use my loud voice so

21:41.000 --> 21:43.000
you can see what the final endurance challenge.

21:43.000 --> 21:45.000
So if you ever watched the TV show,

21:45.000 --> 21:49.000
you know that the final challenge and survivor is usually some sort of

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
endurance challenge. You ready? Okay, here we go.

21:51.000 --> 21:53.000
So Loki, you got to narrate for the podcast.

21:53.000 --> 21:58.000
All right. So, so he has a cup and then let's see,

21:58.000 --> 22:03.000
was this like a shoelace? Yeah. So he's holding a tight shoelace.

22:03.000 --> 22:08.000
So I got to do, how the hell did I do this? I think it was this. Yes.

22:08.000 --> 22:12.000
Okay. And then I got to do, so he's wrapping around his fingers between his hands,

22:12.000 --> 22:15.000
like the thumb and the pinky, right? All right. Thumb and pinky.

22:15.000 --> 22:17.000
I did it the wrong way on one hand.

22:17.000 --> 22:19.000
I hope the hosts are watching because I struck,

22:19.000 --> 22:24.000
I struggled bust with this so hard when we were doing it. Okay.

22:24.000 --> 22:27.000
So you have to make sure the inside is on like those three fingers.

22:27.000 --> 22:32.000
You ready? Uh-huh. Middle finger, pull. Middle finger, pull. Cat's cradle.

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
All right. Cat's cradle. Okay.

22:34.000 --> 22:39.000
So then you have to, oh shit, this is the wrong way.

22:39.000 --> 22:44.000
Okay. Then you have to like. You have to grab this solo cup.

22:44.000 --> 22:48.000
Oh, God damn it. I did what I did during the challenge. No.

22:48.000 --> 22:51.000
Hold on, I'm going to try this one more time. I'm going to try this one more time.

22:51.000 --> 22:54.000
This happened to me during the challenge when we were trying to set up.

22:54.000 --> 22:59.000
Like I could not get it going and I know they were making fun of me.

22:59.000 --> 23:03.000
Okay. So he's putting it back on his hands again.

23:03.000 --> 23:07.000
Middle finger, middle finger. All right. Cat's cradle.

23:07.000 --> 23:11.000
And he's going to grab the cup, which is upside down by wrapping it around it.

23:11.000 --> 23:15.000
And he's got to hold the cup. So I have to hold it out like this. Out in front of him.

23:15.000 --> 23:20.000
As long as possible. That's it. You hold this pose.

23:20.000 --> 23:25.000
If the cup falls, you're out. So guess how long I went.

23:25.000 --> 23:26.000
How many hours?

23:26.000 --> 23:27.000
Nine hours.

23:27.000 --> 23:28.000
Oh.

23:28.000 --> 23:33.000
About, I don't have the final time, but I think I know we hit the 30 minute mark.

23:33.000 --> 23:37.000
So I would say about 32 minutes. The first person was out after three minutes.

23:37.000 --> 23:43.000
He just, the thing about that, like it's one of those things where it's like, it's, it's harder than it looks.

23:43.000 --> 23:46.000
Because if you pull too tight or if you're too loose on that.

23:46.000 --> 23:47.000
It's going to slip off.

23:47.000 --> 23:49.000
It's going to slip off or it's going to fire out with a cannon.

23:49.000 --> 23:55.000
And I think that's what happened to the girl who came in second is I think she adjusted.

23:55.000 --> 23:57.000
Because I could see her doing all these yoga poses and things like that.

23:57.000 --> 23:59.000
And I think when she was doing it, because it's hard.

23:59.000 --> 24:02.000
My hands were freaking killed. My hands are still sore right now.

24:02.000 --> 24:06.000
But I think she pulled too hard and the cup went shooting out.

24:06.000 --> 24:10.000
So, and I think that's why. So, yeah.

24:10.000 --> 24:13.000
And yeah, so that was, that was the challenge we had to do.

24:13.000 --> 24:18.000
They're not all physical though. I know I've showed a lot of physical stuff on OLR, but some of them are like puzzles and things like that.

24:18.000 --> 24:21.000
So it was, yeah, it's been, it's been interesting.

24:21.000 --> 24:23.000
So next week we'll know if I actually won or not.

24:23.000 --> 24:29.000
But I got down to the final two and I'm super considering I, I've played a handful of these games at this point.

24:29.000 --> 24:33.000
And I usually flop them all, meaning I'm usually a pre-jury.

24:33.000 --> 24:35.000
Like I'm just like super stoked that I've gotten as far as I have.

24:35.000 --> 24:37.000
So there you go.

24:37.000 --> 24:38.000
Let's see.

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
Looking in chat at some of the comments there.

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
So let's see.

24:42.000 --> 24:48.000
Kaijuto in chat says, first survivor had Boston Rob, now they have OLR Rob.

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
Who knows? I don't, see, here's the thing.

24:50.000 --> 24:55.000
Playing it from my home is so much easier because I actually get to still eat.

24:55.000 --> 24:57.000
You don't want to see me when I'm hangry.

24:57.000 --> 24:59.000
Like I was already emotional enough over this game.

24:59.000 --> 25:02.000
I don't need to like starve myself to death on top of that.

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
That would be, that would be insane.

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
So anyway, there you go.

25:06.000 --> 25:11.000
So that was, that was fakie survivor and we'll see what happens tomorrow.

25:11.000 --> 25:14.000
But I did get to play some video games amongst that because as,

25:14.000 --> 25:18.000
as the numbers were dwindling down, we sort of run out of things to talk about.

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
So I actually got to catch up on some other games.

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
I've been playing Overwatch randomly.

25:22.000 --> 25:27.000
I just, I just started playing some matches and I wanted to see if the party system was in it yet,

25:27.000 --> 25:29.000
or like the forced role thing was in it yet.

25:29.000 --> 25:33.000
It's not, but I still just did some quick plays.

25:33.000 --> 25:37.000
I got to finally do some more matches with Batiste because like he's not so new anymore.

25:37.000 --> 25:39.000
So the newness of him has died down.

25:39.000 --> 25:42.000
So I actually got to do some matches with him and Lucio.

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
And actually I had a great run as Lucio for some healing.

25:44.000 --> 25:45.000
So that's, that's good.

25:45.000 --> 25:50.000
Cause that's a character, excuse me, hiccups that Allen's really good with too.

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
So did some Lucio there as well.

25:52.000 --> 25:55.000
And yeah, so I played some Overwatch and then I've been playing, of course,

25:55.000 --> 25:58.000
a crap ton of Final Fantasy 14.

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
I'm still trying to catch up in the expansion.

26:00.000 --> 26:01.000
I've made it a long way.

26:01.000 --> 26:06.000
I've just completed the level 79 dungeon and trial.

26:06.000 --> 26:07.000
Again, I don't want to ruin it.

26:07.000 --> 26:08.000
So I want to tell you what it is.

26:08.000 --> 26:11.000
It's a great throwback to Final Fantasy 1.

26:11.000 --> 26:12.000
I'll say that much.

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
And if you've played the new expansion,

26:14.000 --> 26:18.000
the level 79 dungeon is a direct reference to Final Fantasy 1.

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
Go back and look it up.

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
So that was pretty cool.

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
But yeah, so I, that's where I'm at.

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
So I'm almost to the end of the story, I think.

26:26.000 --> 26:27.000
So that'll be good.

26:27.000 --> 26:29.000
But the story, the story's kind of picked back up.

26:29.000 --> 26:32.000
It lagged a little bit in the Amorang Zone around level 77,

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
but now it's really picked back up ever since I got out of there.

26:34.000 --> 26:37.000
So I'm really enjoying the Shadowbringers expansion.

26:37.000 --> 26:38.000
It's great.

26:38.000 --> 26:42.000
So actdeft going back to Overwatch saying,

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
I'm waiting for Sigma to release officially.

26:44.000 --> 26:47.000
The little I played of him on the PTR was fun.

26:47.000 --> 26:48.000
Yeah, I want to check out Sigma as well,

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
although I haven't done the PTR yet.

26:50.000 --> 26:51.000
Going back to Survivor,

26:51.000 --> 26:53.000
SH-100Matt in chat says,

26:53.000 --> 26:54.000
Nicely done, Rob.

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
Maybe you will come back on the All-Stars version.

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
You know, I've had to, like,

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
I have not streamed in six weeks,

27:00.000 --> 27:03.000
and you can basically blame this game for that.

27:03.000 --> 27:04.000
And I don't regret it.

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
I've met some wonderful people that I'll keep in touch with

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
long after this game is over and so forth.

27:08.000 --> 27:11.000
But I don't know if I could do it again.

27:11.000 --> 27:13.000
Like, it's a lot to put on hold.

27:13.000 --> 27:14.000
And I know I always say that,

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
but here's the difference this time, guys.

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
Usually I get booted, like, in 14th place.

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
So I only spend a week and a half on the game,

27:20.000 --> 27:21.000
and then whatever, it's done.

27:21.000 --> 27:23.000
This time, I've gone the full length of the game.

27:23.000 --> 27:25.000
I mean, win or lose tomorrow,

27:25.000 --> 27:26.000
I went the entire length of the game.

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
It was like 51 days tomorrow.

27:28.000 --> 27:29.000
It's 51 days.

27:29.000 --> 27:33.000
So, you know, that's a long time to put everything else on hold.

27:33.000 --> 27:35.000
But that's, like, Ingress has been on hold.

27:35.000 --> 27:38.000
This has been, like, everything has been on hold.

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
So I don't know if I could do that again.

27:40.000 --> 27:43.000
But I did say, if they do call me for All-Stars,

27:43.000 --> 27:46.000
it's going to be hard to not answer the phone.

27:46.000 --> 27:49.000
But the good news is, so they've already done an All-Stars.

27:49.000 --> 27:51.000
This is the ninth season they have an All-Stars.

27:51.000 --> 27:53.000
It's usually every seven.

27:53.000 --> 27:56.000
So I have a good, like, five seasons to wait.

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
So it's going to be a while before I have to make that choice.

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
And that'll be very good, if they even call me.

28:00.000 --> 28:01.000
But they may not.

28:01.000 --> 28:03.000
There's been a lot of great people that have played the game.

28:03.000 --> 28:05.000
So they may decide, I've had my run, I've had my story.

28:05.000 --> 28:06.000
I don't come back.

28:06.000 --> 28:07.000
But we'll see.

28:07.000 --> 28:10.000
There's not a lot of guys over 30 that play these games.

28:10.000 --> 28:13.000
So I feel a very unique void in that.

28:13.000 --> 28:14.000
So, all right.

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
Anyway, enough about all that.

28:16.000 --> 28:19.000
Let's get into some other housekeeping.

28:19.000 --> 28:21.000
Oh, before we get to the gaming news,

28:21.000 --> 28:26.000
I should give DragonCon a plug because DragonCon is coming up.

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
So some quick programming note.

28:28.000 --> 28:33.000
We will be here live with Dark Sakura next week for episode 789.

28:33.000 --> 28:38.000
790, the week after that, will be pre-taped.

28:38.000 --> 28:41.000
We will be taping that without an audience in advance,

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
but we will be taking your questions.

28:43.000 --> 28:46.000
It's going to be very much a listener-driven show with your questions.

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
We may try to do an interview or something during that week as well.

28:48.000 --> 28:51.000
And Gamescom is going to happen that week.

28:51.000 --> 28:52.000
So we'll be able to do that.

28:52.000 --> 28:53.000
That'll be a lot of news, yeah.

28:53.000 --> 28:54.000
Yeah, that'll be quite a bit going on.

28:54.000 --> 28:55.000
So we're going to tape that without an audience.

28:56.000 --> 28:59.000
And then that will premiere on Sunday night after the Bobby Blackwell show.

28:59.000 --> 29:01.000
That is due to my travel.

29:01.000 --> 29:03.000
I'm actually leaving a week early for DragonCon this year

29:03.000 --> 29:07.000
to go spend time with Xtfer out in North Carolina where he lives now.

29:07.000 --> 29:09.000
So I will be leaving the day before.

29:09.000 --> 29:12.000
So 790 will not be live, but we hope you all will come out anyway.

29:12.000 --> 29:15.000
And then it'll still be on the podcast feed and all that good stuff as well.

29:15.000 --> 29:17.000
And you guys can certainly chat about it.

29:17.000 --> 29:20.000
And I will go back and read the chat transcript afterwards because I do that.

29:20.000 --> 29:23.000
And then there will be no show Labor Day Weekend

29:23.000 --> 29:26.000
because DragonCon is going on.

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
And we will be back the week after Labor Day.

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
I think it's September 8th is the date.

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
We'll be back with episode 791 at that point.

29:32.000 --> 29:35.000
So that's kind of how that is going to go.

29:35.000 --> 29:38.000
Wow, episode 800 is going to be before the end of the year.

29:38.000 --> 29:39.000
That's crazy, isn't it?

29:39.000 --> 29:40.000
Yeah, anyway.

29:40.000 --> 29:46.000
So, yeah, and Bobby will still be live that week that 790 is taped in advance.

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
Now, speaking of DragonCon,

29:48.000 --> 29:51.000
the channel won't necessarily be dark during DragonCon

29:51.000 --> 29:56.000
because we will be hosting the brand new DragonCon Twitch channel,

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
which, Bobby, I'm going to butcher this name.

29:58.000 --> 29:59.000
I'm sorry, so correct me if I'm wrong.

29:59.000 --> 30:02.000
I believe it's DC Media Track is their Twitch.

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
Bobby will correct me in chat if I'm wrong.

30:04.000 --> 30:08.000
But we're going to be hosting their channel here at VOG

30:08.000 --> 30:11.000
because some of the panels that Bobby, myself,

30:11.000 --> 30:15.000
and some other folks you might know will actually be broadcast on that.

30:15.000 --> 30:18.000
So even though there might not be an OLR that weekend or a Bobby that weekend,

30:18.000 --> 30:21.000
you can actually tune in on Twitch and you'll be able to see some other stuff going on.

30:21.000 --> 30:22.000
Thank you, Bobby.

30:22.000 --> 30:25.000
It's DC Digital Media is the actual name of that channel.

30:25.000 --> 30:27.000
So you can go give them a follow if you want.

30:27.000 --> 30:31.000
I figured I probably should tell you what my DragonCon schedule is.

30:31.000 --> 30:34.000
I think we're at the point where I can share that with you guys.

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
So you guys ready to hear about it?

30:36.000 --> 30:39.000
Of course, now that I've said that, I lost my email.

30:39.000 --> 30:42.000
So I need to bring it up again.

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
Help me buy time, Loki.

30:45.000 --> 30:49.000
Mr. Smoosh is trying to put himself onto a potholder.

30:49.000 --> 30:51.000
Okay, I got it. I got it. Sorry.

30:51.000 --> 30:54.000
So here is my schedule for DragonCon this year.

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
So Friday at 1130.

30:56.000 --> 30:59.000
This is in the room that I don't believe will be broadcast.

30:59.000 --> 31:00.000
It's in Galleria 7.

31:00.000 --> 31:03.000
But I'm going to be on a panel called Discussion or Discord?

31:03.000 --> 31:05.000
What's wrong with peace, love, and understanding?

31:05.000 --> 31:08.000
And that'll be talking about are we encouraging open discussion

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
or are we just eroding debates?

31:10.000 --> 31:13.000
We're going to be talking a little bit about tough fandoms

31:13.000 --> 31:15.000
and some of that real passion that goes into it.

31:15.000 --> 31:17.000
Sometimes we get very passionate on this show.

31:17.000 --> 31:19.000
So we'll talk a little bit about that.

31:19.000 --> 31:22.000
Okay, thanks Bobby, saying that even the Galleria 7 stuff

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
will be recorded and posted later.

31:24.000 --> 31:25.000
It just won't be live.

31:25.000 --> 31:27.000
The stuff in Room 6 is going to be live.

31:27.000 --> 31:29.000
This is a pretty big deal.

31:29.000 --> 31:32.000
So that's my only panel on Friday, believe it or not.

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
No, the Tiger Claw.

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
The panel is called Discussion or Discord?

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
Not to be confused with the Discord app.

31:38.000 --> 31:39.000
It has nothing to do with the Discord app.

31:39.000 --> 31:41.000
It's talking about the actual meaning of Discord

31:41.000 --> 31:43.000
where you disagree with people.

31:43.000 --> 31:44.000
Good question.

31:44.000 --> 31:45.000
Because we do love Discord,

31:45.000 --> 31:47.000
but this panel has nothing to do with that.

31:47.000 --> 31:49.000
That's my only panel on Friday.

31:49.000 --> 31:51.000
So this one's a pretty big deal on Saturday.

31:51.000 --> 31:52.000
You ready for this?

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
So Saturday at 1130 a.m.

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
at the Peachtree Ballroom at the Westin.

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
So it's a ballroom, this is a big panel.

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
I am fortunate enough to be moderating

32:00.000 --> 32:03.000
Meet the Cast of World of Warcraft.

32:03.000 --> 32:05.000
So I'm going to be moderating a panel with voice actors

32:05.000 --> 32:07.000
including Dave Fennoy.

32:08.000 --> 32:11.000
So he's done voices for Walking Dead and all that.

32:11.000 --> 32:13.000
That's going to be amazing.

32:13.000 --> 32:16.000
Dino Andrade, who I believe is friends with,

32:16.000 --> 32:17.000
I follow him on Twitter.

32:17.000 --> 32:18.000
He's friends with other people

32:18.000 --> 32:19.000
that have been on the show before.

32:19.000 --> 32:22.000
He does Professor Putricide,

32:22.000 --> 32:26.000
and he does all the little gnomes and those voices.

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
He's very good at those voices.

32:28.000 --> 32:31.000
Kimberly Brooks, also a very well-known voice actor,

32:31.000 --> 32:33.000
is going to be on that panel as well.

32:33.000 --> 32:36.000
I believe she is, I may be wrong.

32:36.000 --> 32:37.000
I'm very, very sorry if I got this wrong.

32:37.000 --> 32:40.000
I believe she's the new princess

32:40.000 --> 32:43.000
of the Horde side in this expansion.

32:43.000 --> 32:44.000
I'm so sorry if I'm incorrect,

32:44.000 --> 32:45.000
but I believe that is it.

32:45.000 --> 32:50.000
And then Quentin Flynn and Samantha Inouye-Hart.

32:50.000 --> 32:51.000
And I'm so sorry if I butchered those names

32:51.000 --> 32:54.000
because I haven't done my full research on that yet,

32:54.000 --> 32:57.000
but you know I love World of Warcraft,

32:57.000 --> 32:59.000
so I'm very excited to be doing that.

32:59.000 --> 33:01.000
All right, Saturday at 2.30,

33:01.000 --> 33:03.000
this was the VoG-submitted panel.

33:03.000 --> 33:05.000
So Bobby and I are leading this one.

33:05.000 --> 33:07.000
Video didn't kill the radio star.

33:07.000 --> 33:09.000
Moving your audio podcast to video.

33:09.000 --> 33:11.000
You know, we might know a thing or two about that, right?

33:11.000 --> 33:12.000
I guess.

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
So we're going to be sharing some of the experiences

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
along with Bobby about moving to Twitch,

33:16.000 --> 33:17.000
but you know what's really cool about that panel?

33:17.000 --> 33:20.000
We have some other podcasters that have made that same move.

33:20.000 --> 33:23.000
We have a representative from Twitch on that panel.

33:23.000 --> 33:24.000
What?

33:24.000 --> 33:25.000
Yeah, cool, right?

33:25.000 --> 33:27.000
And that will be streamed.

33:27.000 --> 33:28.000
That is in Galeria 6.

33:28.000 --> 33:31.000
Tell them that you're streaming exclusively a mixer, though.

33:31.000 --> 33:34.000
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

33:34.000 --> 33:37.000
All right, so not when there's a Twitch employee on the panel.

33:37.000 --> 33:39.000
That is Saturday at 2.30 Eastern,

33:39.000 --> 33:42.000
so you've got to subtract three for Pacific, okay?

33:42.000 --> 33:43.000
Oh, is Run, Jump, Stomp on that panel, too?

33:43.000 --> 33:45.000
I don't know his real names.

33:45.000 --> 33:46.000
That's really cool.

33:46.000 --> 33:47.000
All right, awesome.

33:47.000 --> 33:51.000
All right, then I'm on a panel Saturday at 5.30.

33:51.000 --> 33:54.000
This will be in Galeria 6, so it will be streamed.

33:54.000 --> 33:55.000
Very cool.

33:55.000 --> 33:57.000
I'm so honored to be a part of this.

33:57.000 --> 34:01.000
Speaking Out, Podcasting Wall, LGBTQIA+.

34:01.000 --> 34:05.000
So I get to be on the Rainbow panel Saturday at 5.30.

34:05.000 --> 34:06.000
That is awesome.

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
There's going to be some great guests on that,

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
including is Nifty listening?

34:10.000 --> 34:11.000
Nifty, you out there?

34:11.000 --> 34:12.000
Guess who's on that panel?

34:12.000 --> 34:13.000
You're going to be excited about this.

34:13.000 --> 34:14.000
Dax!

34:14.000 --> 34:17.000
From RuPaul's Drag Race Season 8 is on that panel.

34:17.000 --> 34:20.000
So very excited about that.

34:20.000 --> 34:24.000
Sunday at 10 a.m., so that's going to be very, very early,

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
but if you guys want to catch that, it'll be streamed, too.

34:26.000 --> 34:29.000
I'm going to be on the Twitch 102 panel.

34:29.000 --> 34:32.000
So last year I did 101.

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
This year I get to moderate 102.

34:34.000 --> 34:40.000
A lot of feedback we got with 101 was that it was too much about the Ys,

34:40.000 --> 34:43.000
and I think many people that attended were already streaming on Twitch

34:43.000 --> 34:45.000
and wanted to know more about the technicals,

34:45.000 --> 34:47.000
like the promoting your stream, the things like that.

34:47.000 --> 34:49.000
So this panel's for y'all that asked for that.

34:49.000 --> 34:53.000
So that will be Twitch 102.

34:53.000 --> 34:56.000
That will be streamed Sunday at 10 a.m.

34:56.000 --> 35:00.000
And then I believe my last panel, which will be in Galleria 7,

35:00.000 --> 35:03.000
so it's not streamed but it's still an honor to be on this,

35:03.000 --> 35:06.000
Sunday at 5.30, Twitch and other streaming.

35:06.000 --> 35:09.000
So we are allowed to say the word mixer at that panel, Loki.

35:09.000 --> 35:11.000
Twitch and other streaming, growing your audience.

35:11.000 --> 35:15.000
So we talk about how to grow your audience and collaborate and work together.

35:15.000 --> 35:17.000
So I'm excited to meet people.

35:17.000 --> 35:19.000
I'm excited to be a part of it.

35:19.000 --> 35:22.000
I'm so honored that digital media has included me.

35:22.000 --> 35:25.000
I mean, I'm on six panels and five of them are digital media,

35:25.000 --> 35:28.000
and I'm honored that the video game track had me back this year,

35:28.000 --> 35:32.000
even if my schedule only allowed for the one panel, but it's what a panel.

35:32.000 --> 35:35.000
Like, I mean, if I can only do one panel, to be doing World of Warcraft is...

35:35.000 --> 35:40.000
Well, following up from last year where you did, was it the Mass Effect one?

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
I did, I did, and that was an honor as well.

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
I don't know if they, I think they are doing another Mass Effect panel.

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
They just, you know, they want to give somebody else the opportunity,

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
and I can't argue with that.

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
So that's great.

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
So I'm really looking forward to both of those tracks.

35:52.000 --> 35:55.000
And yes, Nifty805 in chat says,

35:55.000 --> 35:58.000
you are hashtag booked and blessed.

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
Yes, I am booked and blessed this year at DragonCon.

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
I'm very excited about it.

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
And yeah, hoping to see all the other events.

36:04.000 --> 36:07.000
If you are planning on attending DragonCon and you'd like to meet up,

36:07.000 --> 36:11.000
please join our Discord channel over at VOG Network.

36:11.000 --> 36:13.000
That's vognetwork.com slash Discord.

36:13.000 --> 36:16.000
We actually have a channel all about conventions,

36:16.000 --> 36:19.000
and we will absolutely be using it for DragonCon this year.

36:19.000 --> 36:22.000
Even if you can't be there, we'll be showing pictures and so forth.

36:22.000 --> 36:25.000
I don't want to speak out a turn,

36:25.000 --> 36:30.000
but I do believe if there is a way for Bobby and myself

36:30.000 --> 36:34.000
to create some sort of video content for y'all at DragonCon,

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
outside of these panels, obviously,

36:36.000 --> 36:39.000
and deliver it to you guys here on the channel,

36:39.000 --> 36:41.000
you bet yourself we'll do that.

36:41.000 --> 36:42.000
We're going to do that.

36:42.000 --> 36:45.000
So I can't give you any details yet because we haven't hashed that out.

36:45.000 --> 36:48.000
But I think it's safe to say we'll have something.

36:48.000 --> 36:49.000
We'll do a little something-something.

36:49.000 --> 36:52.000
And some of VOG Face's past and present will be there.

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
I know some of our friends from Voice Geek Network

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
that do other shows are planning on being there as well.

36:56.000 --> 36:59.000
So I don't think we're going to have quite the large turnout from prior years,

36:59.000 --> 37:01.000
but certainly like Travis Donovan.

37:01.000 --> 37:02.000
I know it's going to be there.

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
Xtopher's very first DragonCon.

37:04.000 --> 37:07.000
I'm excited to have him get to see all that

37:07.000 --> 37:09.000
and give his impressions because he won't hold back.

37:09.000 --> 37:10.000
So that'll be fun.

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
So we'll get to do a little guys-on-a-show reunion

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
while we're at DragonCon so that'll be fun.

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
So we're going to have a great year.

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
Labor Day weekend in Atlanta. It's going down.

37:18.000 --> 37:19.000
I'm excited.

37:19.000 --> 37:21.000
All right. Let's get into more video game news.

37:21.000 --> 37:23.000
So Loki, why don't you start us off?

37:23.000 --> 37:24.000
So this one's interesting.

37:24.000 --> 37:28.000
So apparently Take-Two has sent some private investigators

37:28.000 --> 37:32.000
to a YouTuber's house to kind of crack down on some leaks.

37:32.000 --> 37:36.000
So this was a guy by the name of Supmato.

37:36.000 --> 37:40.000
He was posting different leaked information about Borderlands 3.

37:40.000 --> 37:45.000
And the way he came across some of this stuff was

37:45.000 --> 37:52.000
Take-Two were working on the Twitch integration for Borderlands 3.

37:52.000 --> 37:56.000
And so there was a trailer that came out talking about some of that.

37:56.000 --> 38:00.000
And in the trailer, they goofed and showed the username

38:00.000 --> 38:03.000
of one of the Twitch accounts that's tied to it.

38:03.000 --> 38:06.000
And lo and behold, it was a legit Twitch account.

38:06.000 --> 38:07.000
These people subscribed to it.

38:07.000 --> 38:11.000
They saw other Twitch accounts that had these really weird names attached to that.

38:11.000 --> 38:15.000
And so they were, whereas the accounts were streamed privately,

38:15.000 --> 38:20.000
they could take the mobile app and it would show kind of a screenshot

38:20.000 --> 38:23.000
of what was streaming on that channel, keep refreshing,

38:23.000 --> 38:27.000
and then eventually get screenshots of stuff that they haven't announced things for,

38:27.000 --> 38:29.000
like skill trees and whatnot.

38:29.000 --> 38:33.000
And so he was able to leak stuff out based on that.

38:33.000 --> 38:37.000
They've also DMCA'd, striked his channel 63 times for different videos.

38:37.000 --> 38:39.000
Well, hold on. Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

38:39.000 --> 38:44.000
These were like private Twitch streams that maybe employees were using to stream to each other.

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
But the way the Twitch app works, though.

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
Right. You can still see the thumbnails.

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
So how is that this guy's fault?

38:50.000 --> 38:53.000
They're the ones that broadcast it on Twitch.

38:53.000 --> 38:57.000
Because they're saying that, well, he also had a private Discord

38:57.000 --> 39:01.000
that he charged money to Patreon subscribers to get access to.

39:01.000 --> 39:02.000
Okay, yeah.

39:02.000 --> 39:06.000
And so they're saying that they're selling their copyrighted works.

39:06.000 --> 39:10.000
That's where it gets dicey when you get a little too...

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
I don't know what the word... I don't want to say greedy.

39:12.000 --> 39:13.000
Greedy is the wrong word.

39:13.000 --> 39:16.000
But when you get a little too like, you know,

39:16.000 --> 39:19.000
there's just too much of that overeagerness type of thing

39:19.000 --> 39:22.000
to like be the first to be the one breaking news that it's like,

39:22.000 --> 39:23.000
let's make a little coin off it.

39:23.000 --> 39:26.000
But now it's getting dicey because you're making coin off it no matter how much.

39:26.000 --> 39:27.000
So, yeah.

39:27.000 --> 39:28.000
But he also...

39:28.000 --> 39:29.000
That makes sense.

39:29.000 --> 39:32.000
He also was leaking some other stuff prior to this whole Twitch thing as well.

39:32.000 --> 39:36.000
So, he may have had, you know, communications with different insider employees or whatever.

39:36.000 --> 39:41.000
But this was basically his shtick and what happened.

39:41.000 --> 39:43.000
But he was kind of surprised to see that, you know,

39:43.000 --> 39:45.000
there were some private investigators that actually came to his house

39:45.000 --> 39:47.000
and started questioning about stuff,

39:47.000 --> 39:51.000
which is kind of an interesting move on Take-Two's part.

39:51.000 --> 39:53.000
Overzealous, says ActDeaf, is the word.

39:53.000 --> 39:54.000
Yes, it is.

39:54.000 --> 39:55.000
Wow. Thank you.

39:55.000 --> 39:58.000
And he's an English teacher in Mexico.

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
So, of course, he thinks of the word before I do.

40:00.000 --> 40:01.000
Thank you. Yes.

40:01.000 --> 40:02.000
That is a good word for it.

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
SG100Matt says, stuck your hand in the cookie jar too much.

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
That's another way to put it, for sure.

40:06.000 --> 40:07.000
Yeah.

40:07.000 --> 40:14.000
So, of course, you know, he put out a video talking about the situation was happening.

40:14.000 --> 40:17.000
2K Games put out a statement saying, you know,

40:17.000 --> 40:20.000
that the information that's out there is untrue and incomplete.

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
And so there's some more stuff.

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
But in the end, Take-Two's a big company.

40:24.000 --> 40:28.000
They have enough money to sue him into oblivion or at least, you know,

40:28.000 --> 40:29.000
strong arm him that way.

40:29.000 --> 40:32.000
So, it's going to happen.

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
But now the information is out there.

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
You can't stop the spread of information.

40:36.000 --> 40:37.000
This is true, yes.

40:37.000 --> 40:39.000
So, I mean, maybe some things that they had planned to save for Gamescom

40:39.000 --> 40:43.000
or some other types of announcements are surely out there now.

40:43.000 --> 40:45.000
So, I mean, it does kind of take the wind out of those sails.

40:45.000 --> 40:52.000
But, yeah, I mean, that's just the nature of, like, the, I don't know, journeys.

40:52.000 --> 40:56.000
Well, maybe be careful when you're posting your, you know, streaming video with IDs in there.

40:56.000 --> 40:57.000
That's part of it.

40:57.000 --> 40:59.000
But, yeah, you got to be careful with that stuff.

40:59.000 --> 41:00.000
Don't they have people that review those things?

41:00.000 --> 41:01.000
You would think.

41:01.000 --> 41:04.000
But it also just goes to show, like, you know, just how, you know,

41:04.000 --> 41:09.000
foaming at the mouth people are about, you know, any little piece of information.

41:09.000 --> 41:11.000
I mean, look at YouTube culture.

41:11.000 --> 41:14.000
People will make, and Twitch, or any streaming, really, culture,

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
Twitch, Mixer, whoever you want to say.

41:16.000 --> 41:20.000
But YouTube, I would feel like, especially, people will make five-minute videos

41:20.000 --> 41:24.000
out of, like, hey, some guy posted a Reddit, a thing on Reddit about this.

41:24.000 --> 41:25.000
And let's look into this.

41:25.000 --> 41:28.000
So, you know, that's just, like, you take that one little bit of information,

41:28.000 --> 41:33.000
and it's, like, you just, like, people make all this content about it.

41:33.000 --> 41:34.000
Yeah.

41:34.000 --> 41:35.000
You know, it's crazy.

41:35.000 --> 41:39.000
And I know that I fully see the irony in that when we're doing a show like this.

41:39.000 --> 41:42.000
But I like to think we talk about more than one thing on this show.

41:42.000 --> 41:43.000
You know what I mean?

41:43.000 --> 41:44.000
Yeah.

41:44.000 --> 41:45.000
So, yeah.

41:45.000 --> 41:47.000
So, anyway, people going crazy for Borderlands 3 information.

41:47.000 --> 41:48.000
Yeah.

41:48.000 --> 41:49.000
When's the game come out?

41:49.000 --> 41:50.000
September.

41:50.000 --> 41:51.000
Yeah, okay.

41:51.000 --> 41:52.000
Well, it's only a month away.

41:52.000 --> 41:53.000
It's, like, a few weeks away.

41:53.000 --> 41:54.000
Yeah, it really is.

41:54.000 --> 41:57.000
Now, Dartitsuya in chat says, the dissection videos.

41:57.000 --> 41:59.000
I do enjoy some of those.

41:59.000 --> 42:01.000
Yeah, I'm not knocking them and saying they're all bad.

42:01.000 --> 42:03.000
I'm just saying that's, like, part of the culture,

42:03.000 --> 42:05.000
is that when one little piece of information leaks out,

42:05.000 --> 42:08.000
it's, like, all these, you know, information.

42:08.000 --> 42:12.000
Like, I remember Shane would show me, not so much for this round of Pokémon,

42:12.000 --> 42:15.000
but the last round of Pokémon when, like, X and Y were the new games,

42:15.000 --> 42:18.000
or, I'm sorry, Sun and Moon were the new games.

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
Like, there would be the littlest little trailer,

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
like, two-minute trailer that Nintendo would put out,

42:22.000 --> 42:23.000
a little mini-direct or something.

42:23.000 --> 42:25.000
And then it's, like, the 90-minute discussion video.

42:25.000 --> 42:26.000
Yeah.

42:26.000 --> 42:27.000
It goes on.

42:27.000 --> 42:29.000
Because this was back when we were doing, like, Pokéstop podcasts regularly,

42:29.000 --> 42:31.000
and I was always, like, dang, how do people do, like,

42:31.000 --> 42:33.000
90-minute videos off, like, a two-minute...

42:33.000 --> 42:35.000
I think you'd be surprised.

42:35.000 --> 42:37.000
They were bad videos by any means.

42:37.000 --> 42:39.000
They were definitely, like, enthusiastic fans,

42:39.000 --> 42:43.000
really getting down and dirty on all this content.

42:43.000 --> 42:45.000
So this is very, very interesting.

42:45.000 --> 42:47.000
So, anyway, moving on.

42:47.000 --> 42:51.000
So something that you can't really dissect anymore because it's gone.

42:52.000 --> 42:57.000
It has to do with DuckTales and DuckTales Remastered.

42:57.000 --> 42:59.000
DuckTales Remastered specifically.

42:59.000 --> 43:01.000
No longer available for purchase.

43:01.000 --> 43:04.000
If you thought that game would be around forever, it is not.

43:04.000 --> 43:05.000
At least digitally.

43:05.000 --> 43:08.000
Now, you know, there's physical copies out there in the world,

43:08.000 --> 43:11.000
and, you know, they'll always be out there on secondhand markets,

43:11.000 --> 43:14.000
flea markets, garage sales, places like that.

43:14.000 --> 43:17.000
But I do think because so many people got this game digitally,

43:17.000 --> 43:20.000
and now that option has been pulled,

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
you can no longer get this game digitally.

43:22.000 --> 43:24.000
You can still redownload it if you purchased it before,

43:24.000 --> 43:25.000
so don't freak out.

43:25.000 --> 43:27.000
But, I mean, there's even going to come a day,

43:27.000 --> 43:29.000
just like they pulled down the Wii shop eventually.

43:29.000 --> 43:31.000
There's going to come a day when the Wii U shop,

43:31.000 --> 43:33.000
if you bought it there like I did, goes down,

43:33.000 --> 43:36.000
so you won't be able to redownload it, or, you know, whatever the case.

43:36.000 --> 43:40.000
Well, I bought it on Steam because they had it down for $3.74,

43:40.000 --> 43:41.000
so I was like, yeah.

43:41.000 --> 43:44.000
They had a huge sale, and I wish we could have got this out there

43:44.000 --> 43:47.000
before it got delisted, but they only gave us, like, three days notice.

43:47.000 --> 43:48.000
Yeah.

43:48.000 --> 43:49.000
It was out, and then it was gone.

43:49.000 --> 43:52.000
August 8th was the day it was delisted, so it is gone.

43:52.000 --> 43:56.000
No more can you get this game on Steam or PS3 or Xbox 360.

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
It was backwards compatible on Xbox One, though,

43:58.000 --> 44:01.000
so I wish I did have it.

44:01.000 --> 44:05.000
I think they gave it away for PlayStation games at one point,

44:05.000 --> 44:07.000
so I think I have it on PS3.

44:07.000 --> 44:08.000
Yeah, I do sort of remember that.

44:08.000 --> 44:11.000
And I have it on Wii U, but I don't think I ever got it on Xbox.

44:11.000 --> 44:13.000
I would love to get a physical copy for Xbox, though,

44:13.000 --> 44:15.000
and then that way you could play it on Xbox One,

44:15.000 --> 44:17.000
because it was a good game.

44:17.000 --> 44:21.000
The original DuckTales game is one of the greatest NES games they ever did, really.

44:21.000 --> 44:23.000
Yeah, and the remaster is pretty good, too, from right here.

44:23.000 --> 44:25.000
Yeah, and the remaster was pretty faithful.

44:25.000 --> 44:28.000
It added little bits at the beginning and end,

44:28.000 --> 44:30.000
but they did a really good job with it.

44:30.000 --> 44:33.000
And the vert soundtrack is really, really good

44:33.000 --> 44:36.000
with all the reimaginings of the songs.

44:36.000 --> 44:41.000
So, yeah, they had it down to 374 until it was gone forever,

44:41.000 --> 44:44.000
but the physical version might still be a way to find it,

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
but I imagine the price of that physical version

44:46.000 --> 44:50.000
as people realize it's going to have a little bit of rarity to it now,

44:50.000 --> 44:53.000
the price of that might go up. We'll see.

44:53.000 --> 44:57.000
Now, Bob Coffee says you can still find physical copies for PlayStation 3

44:57.000 --> 45:00.000
at Walmart for $12.88 pretty easily.

45:00.000 --> 45:04.000
Bob Coffee also pointing out, though, that these are showing up on eBay

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
for 40 bucks already.

45:06.000 --> 45:10.000
So you might have to wait a little bit for things to kind of even out a bit.

45:10.000 --> 45:12.000
Just go buy used copies somewhere.

45:12.000 --> 45:15.000
Oh, for sure. Well, even the used copies are probably, you know,

45:15.000 --> 45:17.000
I don't know what it currently runs out on GameStop,

45:17.000 --> 45:19.000
and now your computer's dead, so you can't look it up for me.

45:19.000 --> 45:20.000
I have a phone.

45:20.000 --> 45:23.000
No, it's fine. I'm sure somebody can look it up, too.

45:23.000 --> 45:26.000
Also, D'Artecia points out that was the last performance

45:26.000 --> 45:28.000
of Alan Young's Scrooge.

45:28.000 --> 45:32.000
And, you know, it was great that he still did the voice acting.

45:32.000 --> 45:36.000
You could tell he was a little older, and his voice was a little more,

45:36.000 --> 45:39.000
you know, at a very mature stage, you know, when he was doing it.

45:39.000 --> 45:41.000
I mean, he did a great job, don't get me wrong,

45:41.000 --> 45:43.000
but you could definitely tell it was, you know,

45:43.000 --> 45:46.000
he was getting to that point where he's very, getting older,

45:46.000 --> 45:50.000
and, you know, probably harder for him to do, very hard work.

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
Because who does the voice now? Doesn't David Tennant do the voice

45:52.000 --> 45:54.000
of Uncle Scrooge now in the new?

45:54.000 --> 45:55.000
Yes, I think so.

45:55.000 --> 45:56.000
Yeah.

45:56.000 --> 45:58.000
So let's say, D'Artecia says,

45:58.000 --> 46:01.000
I want to say there was another actress that passed away from that game.

46:01.000 --> 46:04.000
I forget. Wasn't it, I hope I don't butcher the name, June Ferre.

46:04.000 --> 46:05.000
Wasn't it Magic of the Spell?

46:05.000 --> 46:06.000
Yes, it was Magic of the Spell.

46:06.000 --> 46:08.000
I don't remember who that actress is.

46:08.000 --> 46:09.000
It's June Ferre, isn't it?

46:09.000 --> 46:10.000
I'm almost positive.

46:10.000 --> 46:12.000
Somebody look that up for me, because I think I'm right.

46:12.000 --> 46:15.000
Now Bobby Black Wolf talking about the price equalization saying,

46:15.000 --> 46:17.000
just wait a little bit.

46:17.000 --> 46:21.000
Final Fantasy 13 on Xbox 360 shot up on the used market

46:21.000 --> 46:23.000
when the Xbox One backwards compatible version came out,

46:23.000 --> 46:27.000
but after a few months, it was back down to a more reasonable price.

46:27.000 --> 46:28.000
Yeah, absolutely.

46:28.000 --> 46:30.000
D'Artecia does think I got that right.

46:30.000 --> 46:33.000
Yeah, June Ferre was in like her 80s or 90s when that came out.

46:33.000 --> 46:39.000
So, you know, I believe, I want to look up her Wikipedia article

46:39.000 --> 46:41.000
because I don't want to say she passed and then be wrong.

46:41.000 --> 46:43.000
Because that's like the most horrible thing you can do.

46:43.000 --> 46:45.000
She passed on the other project.

46:45.000 --> 46:47.000
Yes, that's right. She passed on to other projects.

46:47.000 --> 46:49.000
Let's double check here.

46:49.000 --> 46:50.000
I'm getting the bit.

46:50.000 --> 46:54.000
Okay, she did pass away in 2017 at 99 years old.

46:54.000 --> 46:55.000
Bless her heart.

46:55.000 --> 46:56.000
That's a long way.

46:56.000 --> 46:58.000
That's a long, big life.

46:58.000 --> 47:02.000
So, yes, June Ferre did pass away and she was looking up.

47:02.000 --> 47:05.000
I'm just confirming in her filmography.

47:05.000 --> 47:06.000
There's radio.

47:06.000 --> 47:07.000
Where's TV?

47:07.000 --> 47:08.000
Where's DuckTales?

47:08.000 --> 47:09.000
It's got to be in the 80s.

47:09.000 --> 47:10.000
Where's DuckTales?

47:10.000 --> 47:12.000
It's got to be in the 80s somewhere, right?

47:12.000 --> 47:14.000
She was on the Smurfs.

47:14.000 --> 47:15.000
She was Jokey Smurf.

47:15.000 --> 47:17.000
I never realized that.

47:17.000 --> 47:19.000
So, she was on the Gummy Bears, too.

47:19.000 --> 47:20.000
Good lord.

47:20.000 --> 47:21.000
Yep, she was Magic and a Spell.

47:21.000 --> 47:23.000
There it is, DuckTales 87 to 90.

47:23.000 --> 47:25.000
So, it's June Ferre.

47:25.000 --> 47:27.000
I'm glad I remembered that, actually.

47:27.000 --> 47:28.000
I'm proud of me.

47:28.000 --> 47:31.000
All right, let's move on.

47:31.000 --> 47:33.000
Some news about Rockstar, right, Loki?

47:33.000 --> 47:42.000
Yeah, so you may know game testers have been kind of getting the brunt of the firings

47:42.000 --> 47:45.000
when game development ends on certain games.

47:45.000 --> 47:49.000
But now, though, that may be changing a little bit with Rockstar

47:49.000 --> 47:53.000
because Rockstar is actually converting their game testers now to full-time,

47:53.000 --> 47:54.000
which is pretty awesome.

47:54.000 --> 47:59.000
So, they're basically now making it full-time positions

47:59.000 --> 48:02.000
so that testers don't have to worry.

48:02.000 --> 48:05.000
Once their contract is up, are they getting fired?

48:05.000 --> 48:07.000
What's their next job going to be?

48:07.000 --> 48:10.000
Now, there's a little bit more stability in that sense, which is kind of nice.

48:12.000 --> 48:16.000
And apparently, this has gone into effect as of the beginning of this month.

48:16.000 --> 48:21.000
And they didn't say how many people this is affecting

48:21.000 --> 48:25.000
or whether it extends to the temporary workers that they had before.

48:25.000 --> 48:27.000
But it is something that's positive, at least.

48:28.000 --> 48:32.000
Yeah, they said a large number of staff are enrolling temporary contracts

48:32.000 --> 48:37.000
and live in the hope that they will be extended and be able to pay rent

48:37.000 --> 48:41.000
as the end of their contract approaches.

48:41.000 --> 48:46.000
I don't feel anyone is uncomfortable speaking out

48:46.000 --> 48:50.000
in the hopes that they can extend long enough to be permanent.

48:50.000 --> 48:54.000
Staff are often reminded how lucky they are simply working for Rockstar.

48:54.000 --> 48:55.000
Yeah, which is unfortunate.

48:55.000 --> 48:57.000
They kind of rub that in their face like,

48:57.000 --> 49:01.000
well, you're lucky to have this job even though it's shitty or whatever.

49:01.000 --> 49:03.000
So, it is nice that they're extending that out

49:03.000 --> 49:05.000
and hopefully paying them better with that.

49:06.000 --> 49:09.000
Maybe other companies can take note of that.

49:09.000 --> 49:11.000
It's nice to hear a little bit of good news

49:11.000 --> 49:13.000
about the way people are treated in the industry

49:13.000 --> 49:16.000
because taking them on as full-time and not just being tapped

49:16.000 --> 49:17.000
means they get the benefits.

49:17.000 --> 49:19.000
There's a lot of other perks that come with that.

49:19.000 --> 49:22.000
Just think of the extra money that you would have, Rockstar, in Take-Two.

49:22.000 --> 49:25.000
If you stop sending private investigators to YouTuber's houses.

49:26.000 --> 49:28.000
Wow. All right.

49:28.000 --> 49:30.000
Let's move on and talk about Gamescom.

49:30.000 --> 49:32.000
It's coming up very soon.

49:32.000 --> 49:34.000
So, those of you maybe over in Europe,

49:34.000 --> 49:37.000
if you're going to be near Germany, maybe Cologne specifically,

49:37.000 --> 49:40.000
you might head on over to Gamescom.

49:40.000 --> 49:45.000
So, Jeff Keeley is actually going to be doing a big press conference

49:45.000 --> 49:48.000
called Gamescom Opening Night Live

49:48.000 --> 49:51.000
because there hasn't really been a big press conference.

49:51.000 --> 49:53.000
Microsoft and Sony used to do them.

49:53.000 --> 49:57.000
PT, the epic playable trailer for the Silent Hill game that never was,

49:57.000 --> 50:00.000
that was a Gamescom thing that came out of Gamescom.

50:00.000 --> 50:02.000
I thought it wasn't Tokyo Game Show or anything.

50:02.000 --> 50:04.000
No, I'm pretty sure it was Gamescom. Yeah.

50:04.000 --> 50:08.000
They even cite that in this story that PT was part of that.

50:08.000 --> 50:09.000
PT2.

50:09.000 --> 50:10.000
Well, yeah.

50:10.000 --> 50:14.000
But anyway, Jeff Keeley is going to be putting together a press conference in Cologne

50:14.000 --> 50:19.000
and of course, Jeff Keeley does the game awards.

50:19.000 --> 50:21.000
So, he's used to putting on these big event shows.

50:21.000 --> 50:28.000
Gamescom Opening Night Live will be Monday, August 19th at 11 a.m. Pacific

50:28.000 --> 50:30.000
because of the weird time zone difference.

50:30.000 --> 50:33.000
It's actually at 8 p.m. over there.

50:33.000 --> 50:35.000
But because they are that far ahead,

50:35.000 --> 50:40.000
it's going to be 11 a.m. for us here in the Pacific coast of the U.S.

50:40.000 --> 50:45.000
So, Hideo Kojima is going to be there to present yet another look at Death Stranding.

50:45.000 --> 50:47.000
We're getting close. I'm okay with it.

50:47.000 --> 50:49.000
Is it coming out this year or is that next year? It's next year.

50:49.000 --> 50:51.000
I think it's next year.

50:51.000 --> 50:52.000
I think it's next year.

50:52.000 --> 50:55.000
Some more publishers that we'll be showing.

50:55.000 --> 50:57.000
There's a lot of people here.

50:57.000 --> 50:58.000
2K Games.

50:58.000 --> 50:59.000
Oh, no. Sorry.

50:59.000 --> 51:00.000
Act Def corrects us and says it is this year.

51:00.000 --> 51:02.000
November is when it is out.

51:02.000 --> 51:03.000
So, there you go.

51:03.000 --> 51:07.000
Anyways, some of the other companies that will be showing up at Opening Night Live.

51:07.000 --> 51:14.000
2K Games, Activision, Bandai Namco, Bungie, Capcom, EA, Epic Games, Google Stadia,

51:14.000 --> 51:21.000
Deep Silver, Private Division, Sega, Squeenix, Sony, THQ Nordic, Ubisoft, and Xbox Game Studios.

51:21.000 --> 51:22.000
That's a lot.

51:22.000 --> 51:24.000
That's a lot of the big players.

51:24.000 --> 51:27.000
That's pretty much everybody you'd expect to do some things at E3.

51:27.000 --> 51:29.000
So, yeah, that'll be cool.

51:29.000 --> 51:34.000
Dark Tetsuya thinks it could be Need for Speed related news coming from EA.

51:34.000 --> 51:35.000
That would be exciting.

51:35.000 --> 51:36.000
We'll be into that.

51:36.000 --> 51:38.000
Yeah, I heard that they're doing a new one.

51:38.000 --> 51:42.000
And they also have a new IP for Plants vs. Zombies.

51:43.000 --> 51:44.000
That's right.

51:44.000 --> 51:47.000
Speaking of new IPs, or, well, this could be recycled.

51:47.000 --> 51:48.000
Who knows?

51:48.000 --> 51:55.000
But apparently Sega is getting ready to reveal a AAA game at Gamescom.

51:55.000 --> 51:56.000
Hmm.

51:56.000 --> 52:00.000
So, yeah, Sega is teasing an all-new AAA game.

52:00.000 --> 52:03.000
They send an email out to various blogs and so forth.

52:03.000 --> 52:11.000
Sega will also be showing off Catherine Full Body, Two Point Hospital, the Sega Genesis Mega Drive Mini, and so forth.

52:11.000 --> 52:14.000
But, yeah, the fact that it's AAA, that's interesting.

52:14.000 --> 52:17.000
Could it be a new Sonic game?

52:17.000 --> 52:20.000
Could it be a new PC related?

52:20.000 --> 52:21.000
I mean, we don't know.

52:21.000 --> 52:24.000
We already know about Phantasy Star Online 2, so I don't think it's that.

52:24.000 --> 52:27.000
Unless, oh shit, if they made, like, a new mainline Phantasy Star game.

52:27.000 --> 52:30.000
Could you imagine, like, after all these years, Phantasy Star 5?

52:30.000 --> 52:32.000
I would be, I'd cry.

52:32.000 --> 52:35.000
That would be amazing if they did, like, a Phantasy Star 5.

52:36.000 --> 52:41.000
Or even just, like, a single player type of game, you know, set in, like, PSO or PSUs.

52:41.000 --> 52:45.000
Like, what was that game on PS Vita, or was it PSP?

52:45.000 --> 52:49.000
Like, it was just, like, Phantasy Star Universe, but, like, a single player campaign.

52:49.000 --> 52:50.000
I'd love something like that.

52:50.000 --> 52:53.000
I would just love another Daytona game.

52:53.000 --> 52:54.000
Huh?

52:54.000 --> 52:55.000
Yeah.

52:55.000 --> 52:56.000
Doo doo doo doo doo doo.

52:56.000 --> 52:57.000
That's all they have to do.

52:57.000 --> 52:58.000
Just play that.

52:58.000 --> 52:59.000
Just play that.

53:00.000 --> 53:05.000
And just as silly, you know, to be really silly, they could have Kazurai come on stage and go,

53:05.000 --> 53:07.000
It's Daytona!

53:08.000 --> 53:09.000
Daytona!

53:09.000 --> 53:11.000
Kazurai's busy being retired at this point.

53:11.000 --> 53:12.000
Oh, come on.

53:12.000 --> 53:13.000
All right.

53:13.000 --> 53:16.000
Questbuster's saying Nintendo will be a game's commifier call correctly.

53:16.000 --> 53:20.000
Luigi's Mansion 3, Sword and Shield, The Witcher 3 port will be there among others.

53:20.000 --> 53:21.000
Yeah, that's true.

53:22.000 --> 53:24.000
S.G. 100 Matt says, Don't over-hype us.

53:24.000 --> 53:28.000
If you over-hype it for us and then tell us it's two years away, you're hurting your own game.

53:29.000 --> 53:30.000
So, we'll see.

53:30.000 --> 53:31.000
It sounds like Sega could be ready to release.

53:31.000 --> 53:33.000
It's Shenmue 4.

53:33.000 --> 53:34.000
Shenmue 4.

53:35.000 --> 53:36.000
And please kickstart it for us.

53:36.000 --> 53:37.000
Anything is possible.

53:37.000 --> 53:38.000
Who knows?

53:38.000 --> 53:41.000
Support our Patreon and it will develop Shenmue 4.

53:41.000 --> 53:42.000
Who knows?

53:42.000 --> 53:43.000
More news, Loki, right?

53:43.000 --> 53:46.000
Yeah, so No Man's Sky Beyond is coming out.

53:46.000 --> 53:48.000
I feel like we've talked about it for the past three weeks.

53:48.000 --> 53:49.000
It's coming.

53:49.000 --> 53:50.000
It's coming.

53:50.000 --> 53:51.000
It's coming.

53:51.000 --> 53:52.000
But they tease us a little more every time, right?

53:52.000 --> 53:53.000
Yeah.

53:53.000 --> 53:55.000
So now it's finally coming out this week, though.

53:55.000 --> 54:01.000
Dude, Alan, when he wasn't playing, he was playing the Black Mesa, the Half-Life redo,

54:01.000 --> 54:02.000
right?

54:02.000 --> 54:03.000
He played that.

54:03.000 --> 54:05.000
I think he finished that, and now he's back on No Man's Sky.

54:05.000 --> 54:06.000
Like, he plays it a lot.

54:06.000 --> 54:09.000
I almost want to re-buy it on PC, just so I can play with him.

54:09.000 --> 54:15.000
I'm with you there, because I was just about to say, so there's a brand new trailer that

54:15.000 --> 54:20.000
got released, and they set it to the same music as the original trailer, and oh my god,

54:20.000 --> 54:23.000
it looks, this is like what it should have been when it launched.

54:23.000 --> 54:25.000
This is like the hype that they had before.

54:25.000 --> 54:27.000
So 16 to 32 players.

54:27.000 --> 54:30.000
They're going to add VR support, the Nexus social space.

54:30.000 --> 54:33.000
You can tame creatures in there.

54:33.000 --> 54:35.000
You can ride them as well.

54:35.000 --> 54:37.000
They also put milking in there.

54:37.000 --> 54:40.000
I don't know if you really need to get blue milk out of those things.

54:40.000 --> 54:48.000
Multiplayer missions, cooking and crafting recipes, better aliens, power and logic and

54:48.000 --> 54:52.000
industrial bases, and lots more.

54:52.000 --> 54:56.000
And that looked awesome, based on the trailer that they had.

54:56.000 --> 55:00.000
Yeah, I was going to say, I was interested in getting it on PC so I could play with Alan,

55:00.000 --> 55:05.000
but I am just too intrigued by the VR part of it.

55:05.000 --> 55:08.000
Like, the fact that it's going to be playable on PlayStation VR.

55:08.000 --> 55:10.000
And Oculus, too.

55:10.000 --> 55:11.000
Oh yeah, for sure.

55:11.000 --> 55:12.000
Yeah, sure.

55:12.000 --> 55:15.000
So if you are on PC, I mean, you're going to have that, but I don't have those.

55:15.000 --> 55:16.000
I have PSVR.

55:16.000 --> 55:17.000
Yeah.

55:17.000 --> 55:20.000
And they said the VR is really good in it, too.

55:20.000 --> 55:24.000
Oh, I'm getting chills just thinking about, like, I hope I can find my disc.

55:24.000 --> 55:26.000
That's the other thing I'm worried about.

55:26.000 --> 55:27.000
So there's that.

55:27.000 --> 55:31.000
And then here's another cool thing, though, that is something that they're interested in doing.

55:31.000 --> 55:33.000
They want to bring it to the Switch.

55:33.000 --> 55:37.000
So that's something else that they're looking into right now, is how can we port this to the Switch?

55:37.000 --> 55:45.000
Because, you know, obviously the Switch is much less powerful than, say, a PlayStation 4 or PC.

55:45.000 --> 55:48.000
But it is something that they're interested in.

55:48.000 --> 55:50.000
And, you know, it's super interesting.

55:50.000 --> 55:51.000
I love the Switch.

55:51.000 --> 55:54.000
We're obviously very focused on what we're doing right now.

55:54.000 --> 56:00.000
We have done a lot of work for PSVR to optimize the game, so I'd be interested to see what's possible.

56:00.000 --> 56:04.000
But at the moment, we're just very focused on what we're doing right now.

56:04.000 --> 56:09.000
So it is something that he's interested in, but we'll see.

56:09.000 --> 56:14.000
It might be a while before that actually happens, if it even is able to happen.

56:14.000 --> 56:20.000
It's just so crazy how much they've really been dedicating themselves to working on this game.

56:20.000 --> 56:29.000
And whether it was something they were always going to do, or they felt a sense of obligation after the first release was not so well received.

56:29.000 --> 56:32.000
But as we know, they've really made up a lot of ground within the industry.

56:32.000 --> 56:34.000
We had that story a few months ago.

56:34.000 --> 56:35.000
I think they've redeemed themselves.

56:35.000 --> 56:36.000
For sure.

56:36.000 --> 56:43.000
It's right up there with Final Fantasy XIV's rebirth, with Diablo III removing the Auction House and fixing the entire freaking game.

56:43.000 --> 56:45.000
What they've done with No Man's Sky is right up there.

56:45.000 --> 56:46.000
I think it's going to be pretty incredible.

56:46.000 --> 56:54.000
I think if the trailer reflects actually what the game is, because remember, that was the issue with the original trailer.

56:54.000 --> 56:55.000
True.

56:55.000 --> 56:56.000
But I think they've gotten better now.

56:56.000 --> 57:03.000
Even just watching Alan play, and Alan has a lot of parts from my old computer, so he's not even running the newest stuff.

57:03.000 --> 57:07.000
And just looking over his shoulder, watching him play on PC, I'm always like,

57:07.000 --> 57:09.000
Dang, this game is so pretty.

57:09.000 --> 57:14.000
Some of the areas that he's in, I'm like, dang, I never really found a place like that on PlayStation.

57:14.000 --> 57:17.000
And it's just so mesmerizing to watch.

57:17.000 --> 57:19.000
It'll be fun. Multiplayer will be fun now.

57:19.000 --> 57:24.000
Yeah, I'm excited for the fans of this game that have been waiting for this for so long.

57:24.000 --> 57:28.000
And I'm excited for people like me that were casuals.

57:28.000 --> 57:32.000
I haven't played it in a very long time since any of the expansions have come out.

57:32.000 --> 57:38.000
Even when they did with the Stargates and stuff, I remember Bobby and I did some streams on Twitch, and we had a good time.

57:38.000 --> 57:43.000
We built star bases so we could find each other, the little Stargates so we could connect, and that was really cool.

57:43.000 --> 57:50.000
So the fact that that's going to get taken even further now with these larger squads, and you put VR on top of that.

57:50.000 --> 57:58.000
The only thing I'm worried about is when I played VR Skyrim, it's beautiful, it's great, it really is immersive.

57:58.000 --> 58:03.000
I could only do it for so long before I just started to feel a certain way.

58:03.000 --> 58:08.000
And that's just the way I'm wired, the way my brain is, and my health and everything.

58:08.000 --> 58:17.000
It's just that after an hour or so, I have to really take it off and be like, I have to disconnect from VR because it's too much.

58:17.000 --> 58:21.000
It starts to have a physical effect on me that I don't like.

58:21.000 --> 58:27.000
So that's the only thing I'm worried about a little bit with this, but for the most part, I'm very excited about it.

58:27.000 --> 58:33.000
Looking in chat, ActDef says, if it does come to the Switch, cross-platform multiplayer, please.

58:33.000 --> 58:35.000
Oh, wouldn't that be great if it wasn't cross-platform?

58:35.000 --> 58:37.000
Well, does it even have cross-platform between PC and PlayStation 4?

58:37.000 --> 58:44.000
They don't because, and I think there's a reason for it, because when the game first launched, we weren't talking about cross-platform and all that yet.

58:44.000 --> 58:48.000
It was just kind of an accepted thing that PC and PS4 would be separate.

58:48.000 --> 58:56.000
Well, I think the problem is now, at this point, probably why they can't fuse them together, is that basically you have one universe on PC.

58:56.000 --> 59:01.000
Where things have been named and everything's got their thing, and you have another universe on PS4 that's kind of the same thing.

59:01.000 --> 59:09.000
I don't know if they can just combine them, because what happens if you've got a planet over here and a planet over here, and you don't know what's been built on one versus the other.

59:09.000 --> 59:15.000
So I don't know if they will be able to successfully bridge that gap without pissing somebody off.

59:15.000 --> 59:22.000
But you would think, couldn't they just take all buildings, like in the entire universe, what would be the odds?

59:22.000 --> 59:33.000
But you know what would happen to somebody, there'd be that Kotaku story, like the merge of the worlds has caused one person's base to be squashed by another person.

59:33.000 --> 59:38.000
There'd be that thing, but I would think there'd be a way to work it out somehow, you never know.

59:38.000 --> 59:41.000
Dartusuya says, I could get into No Man's Sky on Switch.

59:41.000 --> 59:46.000
Run Jump Stomp in chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network says, probably Sony getting in the way.

59:47.000 --> 59:57.000
Well, you know, Sony had to back off a little bit because they were really painted out to be the bad guy in a lot of the talk about Rocket League and what was the big one?

59:57.000 --> 01:00:07.000
Oh, Fortnite. Fortnite was the big one that I think really made PlayStation have to kind of, because it was all the people trying to get their Epic accounts on Switch and they couldn't do it because they had it on PS4.

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:13.000
And like all their stuff was getting locked out and that made Sony look like really bad. That was a very bad PR thing for Sony.

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:19.000
So I think Sony has kind of been forced, pressured by the gamers out there to go back on that a little bit.

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:22.000
And you know, for the most part, they have at this point.

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:27.000
So, um, Run Jump Stomp says, they weren't painted to be the bad guy, they were the bad guy.

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:32.000
You know why I give, here's why I give them just a little shred, a little shred of credit.

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:35.000
Remember guys, I'm a big Final Fantasy XIV player.

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:42.000
That game has always been cross platform between Sony, PlayStation 4, and PC.

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:45.000
So like I've been playing a game for years that is cross platform.

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:48.000
I'm surprised that hasn't come to Xbox One yet.

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:57.000
I'm surprised too amongst all of this that I, that was one of my predictions for E3 was that they would announce that Shadowbringers would be out on Xbox One as well.

01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:02.000
I am also surprised. I can understand maybe why they don't want to do the Switch because you know the reality is-

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:03.000
Well that makes sense, yeah.

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000
Well A, it's an MMO so you can play it on the go.

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:09.000
I'll tell you what, you can bring 11 to the Switch because that should be able to run that.

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:10.000
Yeah.

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:11.000
I would hope.

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:12.000
You know the mobile version.

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:16.000
When is that coming out by the way, the mobile version of 11?

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000
It's been like ten years.

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:21.000
The mobile version of 11 will soon be eligible for Classic Game of the Week.

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:24.000
Like it's that long they've been talking about it.

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:25.000
Anyway.

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:32.000
And yeah, RunJumpStomp says Yoshi P said they would port it to all platforms if all platform holders would agree to cross play.

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:39.000
And then Shad or Shane is in chat saying I'm pretty sure Yoshi P recently said it's Microsoft that's holding off an Xbox One port.

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:40.000
That's so shocking to me.

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000
What do they have to lose?

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:47.000
But then Microsoft went and scored that deal with PSO2 so I don't- it's weird.

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:48.000
I don't-

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:51.000
I'm surprised that they wouldn't want Final Fantasy 14.

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:52.000
I would be, yeah.

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:56.000
Especially when they went out of their way to get Final Fantasy 11.

01:01:56.000 --> 01:02:02.000
Again, you want to talk about like the first cross platform game that you could do Sony, Microsoft, and PCs?

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000
That was Final Fantasy 11.

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:08.000
Like cross platform was not an issue back in 2006?

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:11.000
Well they all connected through the Play Online servers.

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:12.000
I know, I know.

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:13.000
That doesn't really count.

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:14.000
Yeah.

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:15.000
Anyway, alright.

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:16.000
We're going to move on though.

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:17.000
We're going to move on.

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.000
We could talk about cross play but the reality is we don't really know.

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:20.000
We're not in those boardrooms.

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:26.000
We can only kind of take our best guesses through what has been said in various interviews.

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:32.000
Anyway, moving on to the Epic Game Store and a game called Ooblets.

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:39.000
Because Ooblets has recently announced that they will be exclusive to the Epic Game Store temporarily.

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:46.000
Epic offered the development team of two people some financial incentives that would cover Ooblet

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:51.000
and what it would sell as if it were selling on all the different PC stores.

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:54.000
So, you know, it's a financial move, especially when it's two people putting it together.

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000
It's like, you know, somebody's showing you some coin.

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:59.000
It's a financial move that is going to put bread on the table for a little while, right?

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:00.000
So it makes sense.

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:03.000
And that can help them grow their company and do more stuff.

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:11.000
But, oh my God, people got terrible about this because there are some people out there that really hate the Epic Game Store.

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:15.000
Yes, but I'll let you finish.

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:22.000
But there's, I think it's not necessarily the announcement that it's how they announced it.

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:23.000
Okay, fair, fair.

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:24.000
So let's move on then.

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:30.000
So there's an announcement that occurred and it was on the Patreon community.

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000
So I can see, so people were paying money for this.

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000
It's kind of like the Shenmue 3 thing, right?

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:35.000
Well, not necessarily that.

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:38.000
It's just, yeah, read through some of it.

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:41.000
Okay, I will.

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:49.000
The developer said they got thousands, if not tens of thousands of hateful, threatening messages across every platform nonstop.

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:54.000
And then Epic actually came to their defense and kind of said, you know,

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000
we've shared our views about the game business and companies in it.

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.000
We support the game community's right to speak freely.

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:04.000
The announcements of Ooblets highlighted a disturbing trend, which is growing and undermining healthy public discourse.

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:08.000
And that's the coordinated and deliberate creation and promotion of false information,

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:13.000
including fake screenshots, videos and technical analysis accompanied by harassment of partners,

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:17.000
promotion of hateful themes and intimidation of those with opposing views.

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:22.000
Epic is working with many game developers and other partners to build what we believe is a healthier

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:26.000
and more competitive multi-store world for the future and so on and so on.

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:29.000
Now, if you want to go to the announcement, I'm trying to load it on their website right now.

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000
Well, I'll save you the time.

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:36.000
So here's how they announced it and why I think people were kind of a little bit angry about it.

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:40.000
So they basically said, you know, here's what these epic folks are doing.

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:44.000
First, they teach every kid in the world these obnoxious dances,

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:50.000
and now they're offering funding to game developers in exchange for PC exclusivity on their game store.

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:53.000
This is exactly what Mark's warned us about.

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:57.000
Just imagine if other companies got it in their heads and offered funding in exchange for exclusives.

01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:02.000
What would it be next? Game consoles paying for games to be exclusive on their consoles?

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:06.000
Netflix paying for exclusive shows? Newspapers paying for exclusive articles?

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:09.000
Maybe some sort of late capitalist dystopia.

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.000
OK, so it's very like talking down.

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:17.000
You could just say, hey, instead of being assholes like that, you could just say, hey,

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:21.000
we made this decision because we are just two people and it's good.

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:25.000
You know, we want to be exclusive. So we were using this extra capital to do this.

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:29.000
I think people will be more forgiving than that instead of talking down to people.

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:33.000
Yeah, and I will agree now that you've kind of put that in context, like that was a horrible way to deliver that message.

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:38.000
Absolutely. But you don't need to meet crap with worse crap.

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000
You know what I mean? Like that's where this is a problem.

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:46.000
Like it's yes. Right. Yeah. You need to be told like this shitty tone, guys, like like fix it, fix it up.

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:53.000
But like going to the extent of spreading fake information, false screenshots, hate mail, death threats,

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:59.000
all the bullshit you see on Twitter and all that stuff like that is when it's like, y'all like y'all calm down.

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:04.000
Yeah. Like if they just don't like, you know, you know, you know, the best thing you can do.

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:11.000
It's not a tweet. It's not like the best thing you can do. If you're mad, don't buy it.

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:16.000
And not a concept. And that's all they had to do is like just exclude that like paragraph that was in there.

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:20.000
And it would be a decent announcement because the rest of it beyond that, like talks about what they're doing,

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:25.000
what Epic is doing for them, what it means to them, you know, and all that stuff.

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:28.000
And like how how it all like affects positively.

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:33.000
But like it's that asshole tone in the beginning that when people already don't like those types of announcements,

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:38.000
I don't think it's such a big deal when it's like an indie game like that coming to a platform exclusively.

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:46.000
That's fine because you understand that it's more of like the triple A companies that you don't need the extra Epic Games funding.

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:54.000
You know, you're not an independent studio that's trying to, you know, scrap or scrape together some money so that you can actually release your game.

01:06:54.000 --> 01:07:01.000
You know, when you're take two or something, you're releasing Borderlands three on the platform and you really just getting some extra points.

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:05.000
You know, as far as the profit you're going to make, that's a little bit different.

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:10.000
But it doesn't help, though, when people are already sensitive about that stuff and you put in that tone.

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:19.000
But at the same time, you shouldn't, you know, people that are fans or gamers or whatever of that shit shouldn't be just harassing people over it.

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.000
Because come on, that's ridiculous.

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:27.000
S2100Matt in chat says, if you're mad, move on. The industry will continue to move on with or without you.

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:32.000
Questbuster says both sides are to blame, but the threats just played into their assessment of toxic gamers.

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:37.000
Yeah, like, I mean, people, there are valid criticisms of this statement in there, for sure.

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:49.000
But unfortunately, there's too many shitlords on the Internet that are doing the shit lordy thing that now like that is the thing that everybody can point at and go gamers are stupid, you know, and all that stuff.

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:57.000
And that's that is part of the reason then why in the real world when shitty things happen, people are quick to blame gamers.

01:07:57.000 --> 01:08:06.000
Like, I hate to say it, but it is that part of the culture that we're not rejecting harshly enough that is playing into that.

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:13.000
I really believe that, you know, so again and again, I'm not saying I'm not saying like, oh, the Ooblets guys are totally in the right.

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:16.000
No, like they it's just I just don't buy it.

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:23.000
But once again, though, it's not the first company that's made a bad press release and we're talking like two people.

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:28.000
I'm sure they don't have a press person or a social media person. Mistakes happen.

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:31.000
So they're fine with it. They want it like a Facebook.

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:38.000
You know, when I get the sense of humor in it, too, like I'm like I read that and I'm like, I mean, I get your point.

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:41.000
I'm not like bent out of shape about it. I really care either.

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:48.000
I mean, the game is cute. It's so epic exclusive. I kind of over that whole epic exclusive stuff.

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:53.000
Like, oh, no, it's not in my Steam library. I'm kind of over it at this point.

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:58.000
But why are people so bent out of shape over something so small?

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:02.000
I don't understand. I'm kind of with Bobby a little bit on this, though, about his apprehensions about epic.

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:05.000
Like I have an epic store account to just hoard free games.

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:10.000
That's basically what I do. But Bobby, you know, makes a point about why he doesn't buy games.

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:14.000
I don't buy anything on epic game store simply because they don't have any wallet cards I could buy at a store.

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:19.000
I have to give them my credit card info and I don't trust any gaming company with my credit card info.

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:26.000
And like, I respect that in this day and age of data breaches, when the companies who track breaches get breached.

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:29.000
You know, those types of things, when it's that reductive.

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.000
Yo, Doug, I hear like breaches.

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:38.000
Exactly. Like Equifax, the credit monitoring company gets, in fact, breached, you know, because there's that whole get your $4.

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:41.000
Yeah, right. That whole thing. Like, I get it.

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:44.000
Like, you don't want to trust your information out there anywhere.

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:50.000
And, you know, I had money stolen on Xbox 360, certainly as a direct result of these types of breaches.

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:56.000
So, like, I get it. Yeah. She Hulk in chat says, trust no one.

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.000
X-Files. Yeah, for sure. Right.

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:03.000
Questbuster says, I have an epic account, but like Rob, it's only for the freebies.

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:04.000
Yeah, exactly.

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:05.000
I purchased a game.

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:10.000
Actually, sorry, I have to say this. Bobby says, I mean, my EGS account has already been hacked once and they got nothing.

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:16.000
Something like that happened to me. Somebody connected my Epic account to a PlayStation account that wasn't mine.

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:20.000
Because when I went to go do it, it was like, you're already connected to an account. I'm like, who the fuck is this?

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:26.000
So I kind of think my Epic account got breached at some point too.

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:33.000
So, like, I get it. Like, I, in fact, I would encourage people don't give Epic your credit card number. Seriously.

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:36.000
So I just use PayPal through it. Because I've got two factor on PayPal.

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:37.000
Yeah.

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:43.000
And I don't have, I don't have the automatic like, so, you know, pay, make it easier for PayPal to charge your account.

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:48.000
You know, don't just let it like, just do its thing. You know? No, I just two factor everything.

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:53.000
Pop culture in chat says, you know, Arrow works for a credit card processor, but it's not y'all's problem.

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.000
Like that, you're not the problem in your company.

01:10:55.000 --> 01:11:01.000
Your companies aren't the reason the breaches are happening because of like crap security on Epic's side and things of that sort.

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:05.000
You know, so, you know, we already, and I think we're going to do it again tonight.

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:12.000
We already have read different companies in the gaming industry that you would think would do better with information not being able to do so.

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:21.000
You know, so just potentially, because I don't have the facts to back it up, except the fact that it happened to me, potentially add Epic into that, you know?

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:25.000
So, one more comment and then we'll move on to the classic game of the week.

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:29.000
SHO 100 Matt in chat says, gamers need to be the better person in today's age.

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:35.000
Now more than ever, terrible shit is happening all around us. Exclusivity in gaming.

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:41.000
That's like my arch nemesis word, isn't the type of thing worth getting upset over.

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.000
So, all right.

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:50.000
And Bobby Blackwell also says, I do thank Epic gamers for beta testing Borderlands 3 ahead of its launch next March.

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:54.000
All right. You get the joke there, right?

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.000
I was checking. Y'all got the joke, right?

01:11:57.000 --> 01:12:01.000
Okay. Let's move on to a time when the jokes were simpler.

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:04.000
We're going to go to the classic game of the week.

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:12.000
And every week here on the show, usually when she's here, Dark Sakura will step into the gaming vault and find a game that she thinks, hey, you guys should be checking out this game this week.

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:18.000
But Dark Sakura, as we know, is taking a trip down memory lane with the 80s hits from Weird Al Yankovic.

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:19.000
That's why she's not here tonight.

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:24.000
So in her place tonight, usually I try to tape something in advance with a special guest.

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:34.000
But because of all the other stuff I've been doing today, namely a 30 minute immunity challenge, among other things, I didn't get around to doing that segment with somebody else.

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:37.000
So it's been a little while since Loki got to pick.

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:43.000
Yes. And unfortunately, I picked a good one first and then I thought of all these other ones afterwards.

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.000
I'm like, oh man, I should have done those.

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:47.000
I thought you meant the first one that you shot down.

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:56.000
I shot down his first pick because it's a pick where I said, no, that needs to be the game that's like on the last OLR or on some big number OLR game.

01:12:56.000 --> 01:13:01.000
No, I'm not talking about that. I'm talking about like the other weird things I thought of after the fact.

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.000
But this is a really good one that you picked.

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:06.000
So when you texted me this, I'm like, oh, this is perfect.

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:09.000
So the game that we picked, I can describe it in one word.

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:10.000
Rush.

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:13.000
That's right. That's the sound I would hear every time I would go.

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:18.000
Oh, I just want to say I don't know how that happened. My template is muted over.

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:22.000
No, no. The classic game noise is just very low.

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:27.000
It's actually the long play is by classic game videos, not the name displayed there, but their watermark is on the corner there.

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.000
Sorry, guys. It's a typo on my end.

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:40.000
Anyways, that's the sound I used to hear every time I'd go play Cuzar because we had a San Francisco Rush Extreme Racing machine, actually two of them there to play.

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:48.000
And so San Francisco Rush Extreme Racing was a game that was put out by Atari Games published by Midway back in 1996.

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:55.000
It later then came out on consoles, of course, of the Nintendo 64 and 97 and finally PlayStation 98.

01:13:55.000 --> 01:14:08.000
Of course, San Francisco Rush was a very stunt based racing game set in San Francisco with all sorts of crazy obstacle courses and shortcuts to go through.

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:15.000
Lots of air and all sorts of fun stuff. And I wasn't very good at it, but it was a lot of fun.

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:23.000
The game was they had several different versions of the game. They kind of all came out around the same time each other.

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:27.000
The one I played the most was actually San Francisco Rush The Rock.

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:33.000
So that version featured a set of tracks in Alcatraz, which are pretty fun as well.

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:46.000
That was in 97. And then, of course, they also had a version that came out in 98 that I was unaware of called San Francisco Rush The Rock Wave Net, which apparently supported online multiplayer.

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:49.000
All the way back in 98. That's kind of crazy.

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:57.000
So San Francisco Rush was built around the 3DFX Voodoo Graphics dual chip.

01:14:57.000 --> 01:15:00.000
Voodoo Economics?

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:05.000
It was, yeah, it apparently had cars going 150 to 160 miles per hour.

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:12.000
And they, of course, created an alternate version of San Francisco for the game.

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:18.000
Some really great ports. So the Nintendo 64 edition, I remember playing that one quite a bit.

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:24.000
The PlayStation one as well. They also did it as part of the Midway Treasures, volume of three.

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:30.000
I believe it had all the racing games in there. That came out in GameCube, PlayStation 2, and Xbox at one time.

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:33.000
And I think I even have the PC version on that.

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:40.000
Of course, this followed up later on. They had an Nintendo 64 sequel, Rush 2 Extreme Racing USA.

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:46.000
That was released in 1998. And, of course, the arcade follow up, San Francisco Rush 2049.

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:51.000
And that came out later on in the Dreamcast and Nintendo 64 as well.

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:57.000
And then, finally, they had LA Rush, which was released in 2005. I never played that one.

01:15:57.000 --> 01:16:06.000
But, yeah, got some decent reviews and I definitely spent a lot of money on this game.

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:09.000
And had a lot of fun playing it.

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:12.000
But, yeah, that's my pick. San Francisco Rush.

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:18.000
And we really need, like, an updated version of this to come out, aside from 2049.

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:22.000
I think they do have, actually, a newer one now that's one of those...

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:28.000
I don't know. I get that confused with Cruis'n USA or the Cruis'n series, but they need a new one.

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:32.000
Besides, the targets aren't really making anything decent.

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:33.000
Maybe this will be...

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.000
Oh, they have their own little computer, though.

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:40.000
I was about to say, maybe this will be something that comes out on their new console.

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:47.000
But, yeah. So, the Classic Game of the Week, San Francisco Rush, Extreme Racing.

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:50.000
Are you done there?

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:54.000
Sorry, I'm sending Jamie a text message real quick while she's at the concert.

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:58.000
There was a very kind gesture in our chat room that I want to make sure she knows about,

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:00.000
so I'm trying to text her right now. So, anyway.

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:02.000
Well, you don't have anything else to say about the game?

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:04.000
I don't have anything else to say. I wonder if this is something...

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:09.000
They should run this for Awesome Games Done Quick.

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:13.000
I would love to see, like, someone actually take all the shortcuts in these.

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:15.000
Did you ever play, like, the home versions on Nintendo 64?

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:18.000
I played the Nintendo 64 one, yeah, quite a bit, actually.

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:23.000
That was because it was actually a really good port of it, and I think that was the Rush to Rock one.

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:27.000
I just remember trying to play this, like, every time I'd go to try to hit that tunnel right there,

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:28.000
it always crashed in the roof.

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:33.000
It was just... That was one of the things with the driving cabinets that they had in here,

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:36.000
that, like, it was very hard to steer those cars.

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:40.000
I mean, they were just... Yeah, that was me pretty much the entire time,

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:42.000
just crashing into the walls.

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:45.000
But, yeah, it was a fun game.

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:47.000
You know what game you could have picked for racing?

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:50.000
F-Zero, because I don't think we... I don't think... Or F-Zero GX.

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:52.000
I don't think it's... I'm pretty sure we picked F-Zero.

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.000
Have we? Oh, maybe. I don't know. All right.

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:57.000
Anyway, no, but that's a really good pick. Like, I can't be mad about that, for sure.

01:17:57.000 --> 01:18:00.000
So there it is, the classic game of the week. San Francisco Rush.

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:02.000
Yes. All right. Anyway, let's move on.

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:05.000
We've got plenty more show to go, plenty more stories to cover,

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:08.000
and your calls a little later on on our Discord server

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:11.000
over at vognetwork.com slash Discord.

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.000
That's vognetwork.com slash Discord.

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.000
First, some rapid fire news.

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:19.000
So the first thing we have is they finally put out the final list

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:23.000
of the PC Engine TurboGrafx-16 mini games that are going to be coming out.

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:29.000
So, newly announced games that are going to be coming to those versions as well.

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:32.000
So now we have, aside from everything that's been released so far,

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:40.000
Dragon's Spirit, Galaga 88, the Genji and the Hyaki clans,

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:48.000
The Legend of Valkyrie, Seirei Senshi Spriggan, and Spriggan Mark II,

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:54.000
as well as they're going to be including Splatterhouse as well.

01:18:54.000 --> 01:19:00.000
And it makes a total of 50 games that are going to be bundled with those now.

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:02.000
So that's pretty awesome.

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:04.000
March, I don't know.

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:08.000
I didn't get in on that, but eh, what are you going to do?

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:11.000
I did, and hearing this news makes me even happier.

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:13.000
Now we get Splatterhouse too on top of all that,

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:15.000
and there are some other good games in there too.

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:17.000
I'm so pumped for this TurboGrafx.

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:21.000
Never in my life have I been excited about a TurboGrafx thing, but I am tonight.

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:23.000
So this is pretty exciting.

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:27.000
So there is a brand new total conversion mod

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:30.000
that's being done for Serious Sam Fusion,

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:34.000
or I should say Serious Sam 3 is part of Serious Sam Fusion,

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:40.000
and it is a total conversion that puts the game of Duke Nukem 3D in that engine.

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:45.000
So it is a remake of Duke Nukem 3D, but here's the best part about it.

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:50.000
So not only is it Duke Nukem 3D with better graphics and better gameplay,

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:56.000
but they have expanded levels, new weapons, new music made just for the mod,

01:19:56.000 --> 01:20:02.000
and VR support, and it looks fucking awesome.

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:06.000
And the best part is it's free, so you can actually find it.

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:12.000
It's called Serious Duke 3D, so go to the Serious Sam Fusion 2017.

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:16.000
They have the beta version I think that you can get.

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:21.000
And if you have Serious Sam 3, then you can download this mod for free,

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:25.000
and it's linked within their forums that they have in Steam.

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:29.000
But I've got to check this out. I think I have all the Serious Sam collection.

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:32.000
I don't know if I have Fusion though, but I'll take a look at that.

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:36.000
But it looked really good, so I'm really wanting to check this out.

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:41.000
It looks actually, funny enough, better than what Gearbox would have done with this stuff.

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:47.000
So before I get to my rapid-fire stories, I've been texting DarkSakura a little bit

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:50.000
because of that very kind gesture from She-Hulk in our chat room.

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:56.000
But DarkSakura actually texted me this very lovely picture.

01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:58.000
That's why I stood up for a minute here, so I can show it again.

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:01.000
Very lovely picture of herself and Dan. There you go.

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:04.000
They're at the Weirdo concert. You can see the empty seats behind them.

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:07.000
So I don't think it started just yet. It probably starts at about 8 o'clock.

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:13.000
So very lovely. What a handsome couple there. They look great.

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:17.000
So good photo. Thank you, She-Hulk, because I probably would not have texted her

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:20.000
if you hadn't provoked me to with that lovely gesture in our chat room.

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:24.000
So there you go. Anyway, I'm sure they'll be having fun at the concert.

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:30.000
RumJumpStompInChat says, when I saw Weird Al, he stayed after and met every single fan that wanted to.

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:33.000
That sounds like such a weird Al thing to do. It really does.

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:38.000
I remember when DarkSakura and I went to see Greg Proops,

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:42.000
and he didn't have the hugest turnout here in SAC because his podcast was still new,

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:48.000
and it was right around New Year's. I think it was the Saturday between Christmas and New Year's,

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:51.000
and he was here, so he didn't have the hugest crowd.

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:54.000
It was on a Thursday night, but DarkSakura and I went, and he was really cool.

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:56.000
He came around and shook everybody's hand in the audience.

01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:58.000
It was like, thank you for being here. I'm Greg. Who are you?

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:00.000
So I always thought that was a very classy move.

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:03.000
I think he still does the smartest man in the world thing.

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:08.000
He's had that podcast for forever. We went and saw that live once. It was a lot of fun.

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:12.000
Bobby Blackwell says Penn and Teller also hang out in the lobby. That's really cool.

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:17.000
I love it when people are... I think that's a very humble thing to do.

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:24.000
But I also respect sometimes when folks are emotionally spent and they can't do that stuff.

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:27.000
I don't think people should ever have an expectation,

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:33.000
because I can totally respect when maybe a performer has put their all into a performance,

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:39.000
and so they just don't have that emotional gas tank or whatever you want to call it to go out and see everybody.

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:44.000
I totally respect that, but that is amazing these folks that can do that and do have that energy

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:47.000
kind of going that extra mile. That's always really, really cool.

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:51.000
Anyway, let's move on. Sorry, that was a random tangent, but it happens here on OLR.

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:55.000
Getting into some other gaming news, a big tweet from Reggie Fils-Aime,

01:22:55.000 --> 01:23:00.000
who ever since he kind of stepped down as head of Nintendo America,

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:05.000
he has a Twitter account. He doesn't really tweet every day. He doesn't speak up all the time.

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:08.000
I think he's just probably enjoying retirement and time with his kids.

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:11.000
And he fucking earned it, so let him, right?

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:16.000
But he showed up this week. I got something to say, pretty much.

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:19.000
And so when Reggie speaks, y'all better fucking listen.

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:25.000
And this has to do with a comment on deadly mass shootings and the violence in America

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:28.000
and some of the blame that video games are taking for this.

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:31.000
And Reggie Fils-Aime tweeted the following, and I quote,

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:36.000
When the ill-informed are being critical of the gaming industry and community,

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:38.000
this is a very powerful story.

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:43.000
He had actually quote-tweeted a Jeff Keighley story about video games

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:48.000
and bringing people together and actually helping to get somebody to get Canadian citizenship

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:52.000
through the power of video games. So this was a quote-tweet for Reggie Fils-Aime.

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:55.000
You can attach somebody else's tweet. So this is what that was.

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:58.000
So anyway, this is a very powerful story.

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:04.000
The facts are that countries with higher per capita gaming revenue have fewer gun shooting deaths,

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:09.000
except the US, where 4% of the population own 43% of the guns.

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:13.000
And you know, I don't want to step into gun debate tonight,

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:18.000
but I think he does make that point, as a lot of people have said this point.

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:21.000
Japan has the same video games we do.

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:24.000
Most of the countries in Europe have the same video games we do.

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:28.000
Australia, save for one or two, like Mortal Kombat and stuff,

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:30.000
you know, some of those tragedy, or not tragedy, sorry,

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:33.000
some of those controversies is the word I was looking for.

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:37.000
Australia, for the most part, has the same video games we do, and so on and so on.

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:42.000
These countries do not have the level of the problems we have.

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:45.000
Yes, we all know there was a horrific incident that happened in New Zealand.

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:48.000
It doesn't happen at the frequency that it's happening here.

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:49.000
You know what I mean?

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:55.000
Right, and we understand that, but it's pretty transparent why politicians are blaming video games,

01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:59.000
because they're getting paid by the NRA, they get money from the NRA.

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:01.000
And they don't get money from video games.

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:04.000
They don't get money from video games, and unfortunately they're beholden to money,

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:09.000
and so they just blame video games because it's an old way of thinking, blaming other things.

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:14.000
There's been so many things to blame violence on, like whether it was comic books,

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:22.000
or rock and roll music, or movies, or TV, or video games, or whatever.

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:28.000
I mean, Magic the Gathering, I mean, just all sorts of ridiculous things that people blame violence on,

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:29.000
and it's never-

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:31.000
Oh, Bobby in chat says D&D. I remember-

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:32.000
D&D, yes.

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:36.000
When my mom was like, you're playing Dungeons and Dragons, you can't rob.

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:38.000
Don't use your imagination, at least of violence!

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:48.000
I know, but what's interesting to me is because I do think my mom learned a lot in the years that she was alive that I was growing up.

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:56.000
I think she learned a lot through me, and I think my mom in her late 70s before she passed,

01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:59.000
I think if she looked back at some of the things she had said when I was growing up like that,

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:04.000
I think she would go, at least he wasn't doing drugs.

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:08.000
That would have honestly been what she would have fallen on.

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:12.000
It's like, so he was playing D&D, at least he wasn't doing drugs, you know?

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:21.000
It's stupid, and it really is, and unfortunately, if the government makes decisions about censoring video games,

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:27.000
we're not going to see any change in the violence that's out there, and it's not going to make a difference.

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:33.000
They just need to get the work that needs to be done, done.

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:38.000
When everybody keeps saying, do something about the gun violence, do something about the guns, they need to do that.

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:44.000
The problem is, the base that supports the people that are in power right now, they love their guns,

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:50.000
and they won't have anybody telling them that guns are bad, because they're used as a threat.

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:55.000
Oh, if these people get elected, they're going to take your guns away, and that's what it comes down to, is politics.

01:26:55.000 --> 01:27:02.000
The cracks in all of that are starting to show, it's taken way too fucking long, but the cracks in that are finally starting to show.

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:07.000
The governor of Ohio tried to give some speech right after all that.

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:11.000
There were all of these people out there yelling, do something, do something, do something.

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:14.000
They just started screaming during this whole thing, do something.

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:17.000
And he pretty much was not able to give his speech, and you know what?

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:23.000
The next day, he came out and said, I think maybe it's time to look at doing this type of thing.

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:28.000
I don't remember the exact thing he proposed, but I don't remember if it was the extended background checks or something like that,

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:34.000
but it took the people going out and being fucking pissed off to finally make that change.

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:36.000
And it took way too long.

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:42.000
And then when you had the president mimicking that, well, maybe we'll look at extending the background checks or whatever,

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:47.000
then he gets a call from the NRA saying, that's not a good idea, you shouldn't be doing that,

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:52.000
and then he walks it back because, hey, if you want our support, you're not going to do that.

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:56.000
Anyway, I think Dark Titsia kind of wraps this up, to try to shift away from politics,

01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:59.000
Dark Titsia I think kind of wraps this up nicely with his comment in our chat saying,

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:05.000
I didn't want to open this can of worms again, I just thought it was really great that Reggie would go to bat for us.

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:07.000
And I absolutely agree, absolutely agree.

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:13.000
You know, it's great that, because Reggie didn't have to say shit, he doesn't work in the video games industry anymore.

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:20.000
Reggie can sit there sipping a drink out of a coconut on the Bahamas and the islands and not give a fuck about any of this,

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:27.000
and he would be well within his rights to do so, but the fact that he is still, like, he's showing up from all that to say something about this,

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:32.000
that's near and dear to his heart, like, as if we didn't love him enough, right?

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:36.000
As if we didn't love Reggie enough, like, anyway, what a stud.

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:40.000
Alright, anyway, that's all I can say about Reggie, what a stud.

01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:42.000
I think even heterosexual men can agree, what a stud.

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:44.000
Alright, moving on.

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:52.000
Going to a completely different comment here on Sega Ages and the Sega Ages collection.

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:58.000
Space Harrier and Puyo Puyo are games that will be coming out on August 22nd in the West.

01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:03.000
So, yeah, the Sega Ages lineup, very cool, kind of adds a little something to these classic games.

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:08.000
Obviously, Puyo Puyo was also Kirby's Dream Machine, or was it Kirby's?

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:15.000
I might add, I think I mixed the titles, Mr. Robot, or Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine and Kirby's Dream?

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:16.000
Kirby, or was it?

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:19.000
Kirby's Avalanche! Oh my god, why is that name escaping?

01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:22.000
Like, you even say it in the beginning of that game, Kirby's Avalanche!

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:23.000
Anyways, sorry!

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:28.000
I'm sure Act F is, like, screaming the name in chat right now, but I did figure it out before I read chat.

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:33.000
Okay, so anyway, Puyo Puyo is the game all of those are based on, and that will be very cool.

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:38.000
I mean, I think a lot of people saw the Puyo Puyo Cross Tetris was out recently on Switch too, and PS4.

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:43.000
So Puyo Puyo is making its way to Sega Ages, and of course Space Harrier, which, you know,

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:46.000
Dark Soccer is one of her favorite quotes, the welcome to the fantasy zone, get ready.

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:51.000
That all comes from Space Harrier, so it's a bummer she's not here tonight to read this story herself,

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:56.000
but I'm sure she will have her hands all over this come August 22nd, so that's going to be very cool.

01:29:56.000 --> 01:30:00.000
They will be out on the Nintendo Switch coming August 22nd.

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:02.000
I think I'll have to pick that up.

01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:08.000
Space Harrier really reminds me of a game called 3D World Runner, which I'm sure was, like, inspired by,

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:13.000
you know, I'm sure there's a lot, but I happen to play the other one first.

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:16.000
So, but, like, Space Harrier is very cool, so I kind of want to check that out.

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:19.000
That might be a game I can stream, we'll see.

01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:24.000
Anyway, let's move on. Let's talk about what is in stores this week.

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:28.000
Let's travel around the world and check out video games coming to a store near you.

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:31.000
Well, we've got Friday the 13th, the game coming out on Nintendo Switch.

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:33.000
Oh, yeah, finally I'm making a way to the Switch, yeah.

01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:37.000
Because the 13th falls on this week, that's why they're releasing it.

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:43.000
We have the Bard's Tale trilogy on Xbox One, Rebel Galaxy Outlaw on PC,

01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:47.000
Ion Fury on PC, Mac, and Linux.

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:52.000
We've got a Vasara collection on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:56.000
And finally, the Grandia HD collection on Nintendo Switch.

01:30:57.000 --> 01:30:59.000
All right, not sure what's going on in Japan this week,

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:01.000
but it seems like it's kind of a slower week.

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:04.000
We don't really have a lot of releases on the PlayStation 4.

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:06.000
They don't really ramp up until August 22nd,

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:08.000
so the PlayStation 4 is pretty quiet in Japan.

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:14.000
Taking a peek at the Nintendo Switch, I don't see anything out there either.

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:16.000
Like, there's some peripherals and things,

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:18.000
but they don't really pick up until this 22nd either.

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:20.000
I don't know if there's holidays or what have you going on,

01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:22.000
but it's just a very slow time of the year,

01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:26.000
so no Japanese releases outside of just minor hardware

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:29.000
and things like that to talk about right now.

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:31.000
So there you go.

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:33.000
Let's move on to the UK, Loki.

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:35.000
All right, not much coming out of the UK either.

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:38.000
We've got Yu-Gi-Oh! Legacy of the Duelist Link Evolution

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:41.000
coming out on Nintendo Switch, and that is it.

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:43.000
All right, it must be slow.

01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:45.000
But I mean, August isn't typically a big time.

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:47.000
I feel like around Labor Day.

01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:49.000
We're going to ramp up for September.

01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:50.000
That's true.

01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:51.000
But once we start to get into September,

01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:53.000
it's going to really start to ramp up again,

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:55.000
so that certainly makes sense.

01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:59.000
All right, sorry, I misclicked on the little story bar

01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:01.000
on the right-hand side, so we're behind a little bit.

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:03.000
So we're going to move on from world release dates

01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:05.000
and head on into our mailbag.

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:07.000
Every week, we invite your e-mails over at

01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:10.000
participate at orangeloungeradio.com,

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:12.000
and we read some of our favorite e-mails here on the show.

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:15.000
Actually, this week, we really only have one e-mail,

01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:18.000
so let's get to it over at participate at orangeloungeradio.com.

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:20.000
Robert M. with a follow-up to last week,

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:21.000
when we were talking about Pokémon Go

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:24.000
and some of the new filtering systems in Pokémon Go.

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:25.000
Robert M. starts off this week,

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:27.000
thank you very much for the advice for Pokémon Go.

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:31.000
I did find that I have three four-star Pokémon,

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:33.000
which I marked as favorites.

01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:34.000
You're going to tell us that

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:36.000
and then not tell us what Pokémon they were?

01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:38.000
I'm so disappointed.

01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:39.000
All right, oh well.

01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:42.000
I will say I got a second Sentret

01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:44.000
that's a perfect Sentret this week,

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:46.000
so I have two perfect Sentrets.

01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:48.000
I mean, of all the freaking Pokémon to have perfects,

01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:49.000
I get that one.

01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:50.000
Oh well.

01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:52.000
Anyway, Robert M. continues,

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:55.000
as far as other gaming stuffs,

01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:57.000
I have become pretty hooked on the Switch port

01:32:57.000 --> 01:32:59.000
of Lethal League Blaze.

01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:01.000
It's been out since what?

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:03.000
October on Windows,

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:05.000
more recently having a Mac port,

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:07.000
along with the original.

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:09.000
Have any of you checked this one out?

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:10.000
Thanks again.

01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:11.000
And that is from Robert M.

01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:12.000
I must admit,

01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:14.000
I don't know a lot about Lethal League Blaze,

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:15.000
so I'm actually trying to pull up

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:17.000
a little more information on this right now.

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:20.000
It is a projectile fighting game, apparently,

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:23.000
that's available on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch,

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:25.000
and of course, as was mentioned there,

01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:27.000
Windows and Mac OS.

01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:32.000
So yeah, it looks like it's a high-speed ball game

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:34.000
with different characters.

01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:37.000
And yeah, interesting.

01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:40.000
I'm trying to look at the description.

01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:42.000
Something on Google caught my eye here

01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:43.000
when I Googled this game.

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:46.000
I have to see if it really says this.

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:49.000
Hold on here.

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:51.000
Okay, when I Google it,

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:55.000
the little preview on Nintendo's site...

01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:56.000
Hold on, I gotta go back to this,

01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:57.000
because this is really interesting.

01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:59.000
So I Googled the name of the game.

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:00.000
Yeah, okay.

01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:02.000
So look, this little preview here of Nintendo's site.

01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:03.000
It says,

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:07.000
Lethal League Blaze is an intense high-speed ball game

01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:10.000
with unique characters, out-of-sight sounds,

01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:12.000
and none of that weak shit.

01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:14.000
Yeah, it's actually...

01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:16.000
Lethal League is pretty awesome.

01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:17.000
Hold on, hold on.

01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:20.000
Who got the word shit on a Nintendo website?

01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:21.000
That's what I want to know.

01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:23.000
Where did that shit come from?

01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:25.000
Literally, where did that shit come from?

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:29.000
I don't know.

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:31.000
And now I'm looking at the site itself,

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:33.000
and it's telling me that my computer is not running

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:36.000
a good enough browser, and I need to upgrade and so forth.

01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:38.000
But that is so funny.

01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:40.000
Is that like a user comment or something?

01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:42.000
What I like about Lethal League Blaze,

01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:44.000
and one of the things, actually,

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:48.000
I have one of the tracks on my rotation that I listen to.

01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:53.000
So Hideki Naganuma does music on there,

01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:56.000
and you may remember him from...

01:34:57.000 --> 01:34:59.000
No, I can't remember the damn god...

01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:01.000
Fucking the roller skating...

01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:04.000
Oh, Jet Set.

01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:05.000
Jet Set Radio, thank you.

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:07.000
Yes, so you may remember him from Jet Set Radio,

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:08.000
or from 2DX.

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:10.000
He also did songs in 2DX as well,

01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:12.000
but he has a song in there called

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:14.000
Ain't Nothin' Like...

01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:16.000
What was it?

01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:19.000
Was it Ain't Nothin' Like...

01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:21.000
Well, you can tell that that's gonna be the tone, though,

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:22.000
like a Jet Set...

01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:23.000
That's a game.

01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:25.000
Oh my god, Sega's AAA announcement.

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:27.000
Oh my god, Loki, Loki, Loki.

01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:28.000
Sega's AAA announcement.

01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:30.000
What if? What if?

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:31.000
That'd be cool.

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:32.000
A new Jet Set game.

01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:35.000
And it's AAA because the music is gonna be off the charts.

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:37.000
Oh, now look, I'm getting my hopes up.

01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:39.000
This is me getting my hopes up live.

01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:41.000
Now I want Sega to announce a new Jet Set game.

01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:43.000
Oh my god, that'd be so amazing.

01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:45.000
It's probably gonna be like a new Dead or Alive.

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:46.000
Yeah.

01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:49.000
SSG100Matt and Chad said the exact same thing

01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:50.000
at the same time.

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:54.000
What if that AAA game is Jet Set in that series?

01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:57.000
Hey, you know what they say, SSG100Matt,

01:35:57.000 --> 01:35:58.000
great minds think like me.

01:35:58.000 --> 01:35:59.000
Oh, no, Tecmo's Dead or Alive.

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:00.000
What's the Sega one?

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:01.000
Virtual Fighter?

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:02.000
Yeah, Virtual Fighter.

01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:03.000
The Sega thing.

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:04.000
Yeah.

01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:05.000
You never know.

01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:06.000
All right.

01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:07.000
Dark Tetsuya says,

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:09.000
well, I think Hideki is composing for Streets of Rage 4.

01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:11.000
Yeah, I think so too.

01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:13.000
And Act Def bringing us down to reality saying,

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:15.000
that would be amazing, but I don't think it's happening.

01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:16.000
Womp womp.

01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:19.000
But the game is really weird, so it's a fighting game,

01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:22.000
but with a baseball or something like that.

01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:24.000
So they're actually throwing this ball around

01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:25.000
as you're fighting.

01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:26.000
It's really weird.

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:28.000
But it looks pretty cool.

01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:30.000
Speaking of Sega letting us down,

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:32.000
you remember that Actraiser clone they were doing?

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:33.000
Yeah.

01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:34.000
Yeah, I'm hearing it.

01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:35.000
Yeah, I know.

01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:36.000
I'm hearing this ain't it.

01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:37.000
Garbage.

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:38.000
This ain't it.

01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:39.000
Spiritual six.

01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:40.000
Ain't it.

01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:41.000
That's a bummer.

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:43.000
I still kind of want to try it and see for myself

01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:45.000
because, you know, I don't remember Actraiser being

01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:47.000
on people's top 10 list back in the day.

01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:49.000
Like that was kind of one of those like underground

01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:50.000
sort of like titles.

01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:53.000
But a lot of stuff I'm reading about the Sega thing.

01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:54.000
Yeah.

01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:56.000
It's a new Altered Beast.

01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:57.000
That's what the.

01:36:57.000 --> 01:36:58.000
Yike.

01:36:58.000 --> 01:36:59.000
Yike.

01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:00.000
All right.

01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:01.000
Moving on.

01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:03.000
Let's get to some more news.

01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:04.000
Loki.

01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:05.000
All right.

01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:09.000
So because as we were just talking about the whole

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:12.000
gun debate and everything and with everybody blaming

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:15.000
video games for the violence,

01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:17.000
Walmart does the most Walmart thing ever.

01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:19.000
And they decided that, hey, guess what?

01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:21.000
We're going to remove all violent video game signage

01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:26.000
in the store so that we don't we want to any signing

01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:29.000
or display that contains violent images or aggressive

01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:30.000
behavior needs to come down.

01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:33.000
So remove, turn off, cancel.

01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:36.000
You know, anything that has to do with that stuff

01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:39.000
because of these mass shootings that have been going on.

01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:42.000
We're still going to sell guns,

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:44.000
but remove those video game signs.

01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:47.000
Just so you know, no one gets offended.

01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:50.000
I think I mean, if they don't want to advertise

01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:52.000
or promote certain games, you know,

01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:53.000
they are within their rights.

01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:56.000
I just I'm disappointed that they have played into

01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:59.000
this narrative that is false.

01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:02.000
That certain people are putting out there about video games

01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:04.000
and the effect that it has on people with no proof

01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:05.000
to back that up.

01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:09.000
Especially when, again, video games are not something

01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:11.000
unique to the United States of America.

01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:15.000
These same video games are in Canada, Australia,

01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:18.000
Britain, Scotland, Japan.

01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:19.000
The list goes on and on.

01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:20.000
You get the point.

01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:22.000
And they don't have these same problems

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:23.000
in these other places.

01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:24.000
Yet we have them here.

01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:27.000
Well, so it's just it's just disappointing that

01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:30.000
Walmart kind of got on that bandwagon, so to speak.

01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:31.000
Well, on top of that, also,

01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:37.000
there was supposed to be some sort of what was it?

01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:39.000
I don't know if it was an no, it wasn't anthem.

01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:44.000
It was the there was supposed to be some other like

01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:48.000
online competition that was going to be around.

01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:49.000
I can't remember the name of the game.

01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:51.000
But anyways, they were like postponing it again

01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:52.000
because of the mass shootings.

01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:55.000
And it was funny because like I was watching Jim Sterling

01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:57.000
talking about, you know, these mass shootings

01:38:57.000 --> 01:38:59.000
and stuff and how they're postponing this tournament

01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:00.000
because of that.

01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:03.000
He's like, so what are they going to do next week

01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:04.000
when the next mass shooting happens

01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:06.000
or the next week when the next mass shooting happens

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:07.000
or the week after that?

01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:09.000
They're just going to keep pushing this tournament

01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:11.000
down the road because of these mass shootings.

01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:13.000
It's not going to change anything

01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:16.000
because game violence doesn't have any bearing

01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:18.000
on this mass shooting stuff.

01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:20.000
Now, Dr. Suya in chat says,

01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:22.000
don't they only sell the clean versions of albums

01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:23.000
or am I remembering it wrong?

01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:24.000
No, they used to.

01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:26.000
That was the thing that they used to do.

01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:27.000
I don't think they do that anymore.

01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:28.000
Well, I think in general,

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:30.000
they got out of the music business.

01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:32.000
They still sell music, but it's very little.

01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:35.000
Even like movies is very, very skilled back.

01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:37.000
Because a lot of that went digital.

01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:39.000
And I'm sure games are going to go that same way, too,

01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:41.000
as more and more of that goes digital.

01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:42.000
Yeah, eventually.

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:43.000
You know what else is kind of weird

01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:44.000
about this whole story in a very like

01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:46.000
it's a small world kind of way?

01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:48.000
Like the guy that broke this on Twitter

01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:50.000
and had the copy of the Walmart announcement

01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:51.000
and all that.

01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:52.000
Yeah, longtime Twitter friend of mine.

01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:53.000
I was like the second or third person.

01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:54.000
I like that tweet.

01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:55.000
Yeah, I know, right?

01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:57.000
It's a weird like small world type of thing.

01:39:57.000 --> 01:39:59.000
I don't know where he got it.

01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:02.000
I have a theory, but it's not within my,

01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:04.000
it's not my business at all to say.

01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:05.000
But yeah, I just thought that,

01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:06.000
I thought that was interesting

01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:08.000
because I remember seeing that tweet.

01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:10.000
And I remember, I think I might've even retweeted it

01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:12.000
because I was like, very, I was like, God,

01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:14.000
I was like, geez, Louis, you know,

01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:16.000
I'm just rolling my eyes again.

01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:19.000
Like, you know, video games getting blamed for things.

01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:20.000
And then what is this?

01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:21.000
What year is this?

01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:23.000
Suddenly I'm reading a story on NPR

01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:25.000
and they like linked to that same tweet.

01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:28.000
And I was like, oh, I know.

01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:29.000
I'm happy for him though

01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:31.000
because I think he's trying to like land a journalism.

01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:32.000
Like he's kind of like trying to find

01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:34.000
a journalism position and stuff now.

01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:36.000
So hopefully this will, in a weird way,

01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:38.000
bring some attention and maybe help him with that.

01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:42.000
So anyway, it's a weird aside,

01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:43.000
but you guys have to admit like,

01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:44.000
has that ever happened to you

01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:45.000
where like you're on a website

01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:47.000
and like you see a tweet or you see a thing

01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:49.000
and you're like, I know that person.

01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:52.000
Like that's the weird like kind of world we live in, right?

01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:53.000
Yeah.

01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:56.000
Anyway, let's see.

01:40:56.000 --> 01:40:58.000
Going to the chat for some of the comments.

01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:00.000
Bob Coffee says, music got scaled back,

01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:03.000
but games and PC gaming got scaled up.

01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:04.000
Interesting.

01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:07.000
ST100Matt says, I'm sure they will still green light

01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:10.000
during midnight and launches of Call of Duty and so forth.

01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:11.000
Oh yeah.

01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:12.000
Yeah.

01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:14.000
Kaishudo in chat says, there's a method to the madness.

01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:15.000
You have crazy people that want to copy

01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:17.000
the latest news headline.

01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:18.000
So it's smart to postpone it if you can.

01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:21.000
Just till it's out of the news cycle.

01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:26.000
But at the same time, you know, it's,

01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:30.000
then maybe, you know, I know, of course,

01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:31.000
we can't stop selling guns.

01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:34.000
It's just, we can't do that.

01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:36.000
Anyway, let's move on.

01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:38.000
Let's let's go to somewhat lighter fare

01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:40.000
and talk about, let's talk about real problems.

01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:42.000
Oh, Ninja.

01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:43.000
There's even more to this.

01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:44.000
Okay.

01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:45.000
You get into the second half

01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:46.000
because I saw some of this in chat

01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:47.000
and I was like, wait a minute,

01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:48.000
you get into the second half.

01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:49.000
I'll tell the first half.

01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:50.000
Okay, here's the first half.

01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:53.000
So the first half is that, as you all know,

01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:54.000
Ninja left Twitch.

01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:56.000
I mean, here we are two weeks later,

01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:57.000
we're still talking about it,

01:41:57.000 --> 01:41:59.000
but it's because he went over to Mixer.

01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:01.000
So he's over there now.

01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:04.000
I haven't watched, I didn't watch the streams before.

01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:05.000
I haven't watched them since the move,

01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:07.000
but I, once in a while I check out things on Mixer,

01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:09.000
especially like the official Microsoft stuff.

01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:12.000
You know, I have a few, I did like two broadcasts on Mixer.

01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:14.000
I always see a trailer for,

01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:18.000
or they have a loop that's in GameStop

01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:19.000
because we go there occasionally

01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:21.000
so my son can play the demos for...

01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:22.000
For Mixer?

01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:25.000
Yeah, Microsoft, they have a kiosk for Microsoft.

01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:27.000
No playable demos there, but we have,

01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:30.000
it's a trailer for Mixer

01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:32.000
and they have a trailer for that

01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:34.000
accessibility controller that they have,

01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:36.000
which I'm like, that's cool that they have a trailer there

01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:38.000
for that, but who's really buying that?

01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:40.000
No one's buying that here at GameStop right now,

01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:41.000
but it's cool that they have it.

01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:43.000
But there's a long trailer for Mixer.

01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:45.000
Showing like someone playing Forza Horizon.

01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:49.000
Okay, so anyway, Twitch has kind of repurposed

01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:50.000
his channel a little bit.

01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:53.000
I mean, it's, look, Twitch got a lot of clicks.

01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:55.000
It makes sense, I think, for, sorry,

01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:56.000
Ninja got Twitch a lot of clicks.

01:42:56.000 --> 01:42:58.000
It makes sense for Twitch to kind of repurpose

01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:00.000
his channel a little bit for the people

01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:01.000
that might end up there or be curious.

01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:04.000
And so they changed it with a message that says,

01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:06.000
the Ninja you're looking for is in another castle, right?

01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:08.000
I'll throw back to Mario.

01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:09.000
TEEHEE.

01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:11.000
Check out these other popular live channels

01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:13.000
and then of course it shows, you know,

01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:15.000
other people playing Fortnite and so forth.

01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:17.000
And some of the other big streamers

01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:19.000
that do Fortnite is out there.

01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:22.000
So that is what Twitch did.

01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:24.000
But apparently there's a part two to this, right, Loki?

01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:28.000
Yes, the part two is apparently that now on Twitch

01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:30.000
it is showing the top Fortnite streamers

01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:32.000
on his channel instead.

01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:36.000
And what do you think was the top Fortnite streamer recently?

01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:39.000
Why, it was people fucking on camera.

01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:41.000
That's right, people fucking on Twitch,

01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:44.000
right on camera for everybody to see.

01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:46.000
That's the new Fortnite and guess which video

01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:50.000
was number one on that channel for Ninja.

01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:53.000
That's right, it's people fucking the game.

01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:57.000
And of course he was not happy about that.

01:43:57.000 --> 01:44:01.000
He says this is disgusted and I'm so sorry.

01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:03.000
Oh, give me a break.

01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:05.000
That's what he said, did he put out a comment

01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:07.000
as to how disgusted he is about this?

01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:11.000
Yeah, Ninja did, because it's not his channel anymore.

01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:14.000
Okay, like look, ha ha, somebody got

01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:16.000
porned out on Twitch.

01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:18.000
I'm sure Twitch shut that down ASAP.

01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:22.000
But don't fucking fame like, oh my God,

01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:25.000
really, in front of my salad?

01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:27.000
Really?

01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:34.000
Somebody game the system, I'm sure it got shut down.

01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:37.000
Somebody got a screen grab in the 30 seconds it was up.

01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:39.000
His channel now, he says Twitch has now reverted

01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:42.000
my channel back to how an offline page should look.

01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:44.000
Thank you.

01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:46.000
So they've shut everything down now.

01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:48.000
Oh my God.

01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:52.000
But seriously, it's just, it's ridiculous.

01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:54.000
And I saw a screenshot and I was like...

01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:56.000
Run Jump Stomp said Twitch left it running for over two hours.

01:44:56.000 --> 01:44:58.000
Was it like on the weekend or something?

01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:00.000
How did it go for so long?

01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:02.000
I don't know, but like, come on Twitch dude.

01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:04.000
Well, I mean...

01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:06.000
Okay, we all know that the Fortnite

01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:08.000
top recommended stream thing is probably

01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:10.000
automated, right? We've already

01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:12.000
talked about what people read into those thumbnails

01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:14.000
and so forth. Do you think

01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:16.000
that these people fucking

01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:18.000
or whatever, do you think that is the world's

01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:20.000
first people

01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:22.000
on Twitch having sex?

01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:24.000
No, of course not, because we had playroom.

01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:26.000
I was just about to say,

01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:28.000
I was just about to say the fucking playroom

01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:30.000
on PlayStation 4. Like, oh my God,

01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:32.000
like, if I could go back,

01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:34.000
if I could go back to a time in

01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:36.000
gaming history, I would

01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:38.000
not go back to the NES or the

01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:40.000
Atari 2600. I would not go back to those days.

01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:42.000
Because, look, I have a lot of love

01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:44.000
in my heart for the Commodore 64 in all those

01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:46.000
days. I love those days. But here's

01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:48.000
where, you know what I'd go back to?

01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:50.000
I would go back to when the PlayStation 4 was brand

01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:52.000
new and people were streaming the most

01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:54.000
wild shit on the playroom.

01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:56.000
Because...

01:45:56.000 --> 01:45:58.000
Because what is better

01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:00.000
than having sex on stream,

01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:02.000
having sex on stream while

01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:04.000
augmented reality

01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:06.000
robots stare at you and go, what the

01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:08.000
fuck is going on? Like, what are they

01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:10.000
doing?

01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:12.000
They start walking on your back and shit.

01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:16.000
Kaijuno says,

01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:18.000
nah, before playroom we had poker on the

01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:20.000
PlayStation 2 and itoy TV.

01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:22.000
I forgot, yo.

01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:24.000
People could do that on the Xbox 360

01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:26.000
with Uno. I remember that was the thing.

01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:28.000
I'll show you Draw4.

01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:30.000
Yes, I remember when we used

01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:32.000
the itoy for streaming our

01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:34.000
channel.

01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:36.000
Did we use an itoy camera to broadcast

01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:38.000
like the 30 second update

01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:40.000
clips? Yes, we used to do

01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:42.000
that because, and then we also, we

01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:44.000
streamed playing that stupid washing

01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:46.000
windows game that they had on there.

01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:48.000
Remember that? Itoy play.

01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:50.000
Yeah, itoy play. Remember that dumb little song

01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:52.000
where now I'm washing windows.

01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:54.000
Yes.

01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:56.000
Yes.

01:46:56.000 --> 01:46:58.000
We used to do that.

01:46:58.000 --> 01:47:00.000
Why is it so funny? I don't know.

01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:02.000
It was stupid, but it worked.

01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:04.000
I just want to

01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:06.000
come out with a very serious note here, and this isn't

01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:08.000
funny. We shouldn't laugh at this when it comes to porn,

01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:10.000
but it's worth talking about.

01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:12.000
YouTube has a huge problem of people

01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:14.000
trying to get porn on YouTube kids.

01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:16.000
That's gross. Very sick people

01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:18.000
try to do this. I see this as the same thing.

01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:20.000
And you know, bringing us back to Earth

01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:22.000
a little bit here. Yeah, I mean there's a lot of kids

01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:24.000
that look for Fortnite type of streams too.

01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:26.000
So even though we might be having, you know,

01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:28.000
a laugh at the people doing porn, if kids

01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:30.000
find it, it isn't really that funny. Although

01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:32.000
parents should be watching what their kids are

01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:34.000
clicking on. And also, they don't have a Twitch

01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:36.000
Kids or anything like that, and I would see a lot

01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:38.000
of streamers out there probably language wise

01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:40.000
wouldn't necessarily be, you know,

01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:42.000
friendly for kids, so. Fair.

01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:44.000
I would be, I wouldn't

01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:46.000
let my kids go on Twitch probably.

01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:48.000
Yeah, like unsupervised for sure.

01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:50.000
I mean, the crap that my son watches

01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:52.000
most of the time, like

01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:54.000
I swear to God, it's

01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:56.000
fucking Roblox and the guys

01:47:56.000 --> 01:47:58.000
talking about gold diggers all the fucking

01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:00.000
time and how there's like women

01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:02.000
on there that are trying to get Robux

01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:04.000
or, I don't know what the fuck these people

01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:06.000
are talking about, but like, why are you

01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:08.000
talking about gold diggers? You don't fucking know anything

01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:10.000
about what you're talking about.

01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:12.000
Now Questbuster says that's probably why Ninja was

01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:14.000
really upset. He knows his audience and having that

01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:16.000
on his former channel on Twitch was not

01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:18.000
a good look. Right, because

01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:20.000
a lot of people might not know that he moved to

01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:22.000
Mixer, and they're like, well, why is Ninja

01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:24.000
streaming porn on his channel?

01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:26.000
Even though it's not, it's like a

01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:28.000
recommend feed for somebody else, but like

01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:30.000
you know, people don't read into anything.

01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:32.000
Why couldn't he just be a little more shady about it?

01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:34.000
Why couldn't he just be like, well, now you know why I left Twitch.

01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:36.000
Like, why couldn't he just be shady?

01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:38.000
You know, seriously though,

01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:40.000
that is a conversation that a lot

01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:42.000
of people are having right now about

01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:44.000
the unfair

01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:46.000
treatment between, like, some people

01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:48.000
on the platform are getting better treatment than other

01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:50.000
people on the platform, and

01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:52.000
for some reason recently, like, people

01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:54.000
just abusing their pets.

01:48:54.000 --> 01:48:56.000
I don't know why this is a trend.

01:48:56.000 --> 01:48:58.000
Oh, can we not? Because like, oh my

01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:00.000
god, like, I get more upset about

01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:02.000
like the girl that threw the cat on the floor

01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:04.000
and all this. I get more upset about that than like

01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:06.000
people. Oh no, it's not

01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:08.000
even, it's not even that, but like, there's

01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:10.000
another one, it was

01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:12.000
they put their dog in a dryer

01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:14.000
and turned it on. No, I don't want to hear it.

01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:16.000
It's gross, disgusting. But yeah, I don't know

01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:18.000
what's wrong with people. People are

01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:20.000
fucked up, and they shouldn't be streaming that shit.

01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:22.000
No, absolutely not. Gross.

01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:24.000
Oh my god, like, there's a special

01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:26.000
place for you in hell when that all

01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:28.000
oh, I've just discussed it. Why would people

01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:30.000
Can we move on please? Yes, move on.

01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:32.000
Yes, please. And honestly, sadly

01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:34.000
this is not a great story to move on to,

01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:36.000
but it's just the way the story has landed this week, so

01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:38.000
Yes, it is. Let's get more upset.

01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:40.000
So let's talk about how people are being

01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:42.000
man babies again, so

01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:44.000
you know,

01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:46.000
apparently Twitch

01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:48.000
employees are getting threats

01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:50.000
and now the

01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:52.000
police are involved, so

01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:54.000
apparently they've been having

01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:56.000
there's been a serious threat made against

01:49:56.000 --> 01:49:58.000
our San Francisco HQ on Tuesday

01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:00.000
and have been working directly with law

01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:02.000
enforcement as they investigate.

01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:04.000
The safety and security of our employees

01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:06.000
is top priority, and we are focused

01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:08.000
on ensuring this is resolved quickly

01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:10.000
and safely, and to help

01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:12.000
with that, they're having employees actually

01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:14.000
work from home.

01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:16.000
They didn't say exactly what

01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:18.000
the

01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:20.000
threat was, which is probably fine

01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:22.000
because they don't want copycats, but

01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:24.000
that, you know, the fact that you're

01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:26.000
there's an active threat against a platform

01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:28.000
or a company, and like, you know,

01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:30.000
I'm assuming too, the serious threat, like, we're gonna

01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:32.000
come in and shoot up your building or something like that.

01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:34.000
You gotta take that so seriously. I mean, like,

01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:36.000
not even a few months ago

01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:38.000
this happened in YouTube.

01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:40.000
Of course, you don't, you don't say, like,

01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:42.000
what is the number one thing

01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:44.000
that, like, in the biggest font when you're going through the

01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:46.000
TSA at the airport, don't even

01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:48.000
joke, right? Like, that's like,

01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:50.000
like, don't, don't even joke because it

01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:52.000
ain't funny, you know, and it's the

01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:54.000
same thing with these

01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:56.000
threats people are calling into

01:50:56.000 --> 01:50:58.000
Twitch and all this stuff.

01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:00.000
You know, it's not funny. Yeah.

01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:02.000
It's very serious in this, especially in this world

01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:04.000
that we live in. It's gross.

01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:06.000
This is why we need to bring back

01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:08.000
spanking. They need to find

01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:10.000
this person and they need to spank them.

01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:12.000
Like, it's just, it's

01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:14.000
like the little child that they are with

01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:16.000
this little,

01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:18.000
it's just disgusting. Yeah. I think it's so

01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:20.000
gross. All right.

01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:22.000
Anyhow, I hope they find

01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:24.000
the person and my hearts go out

01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:26.000
to the Twitch people that were probably, honestly, with

01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:28.000
everything else going on in the world, we're probably

01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:30.000
shook by this, you know, like,

01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:34.000
I got nothing else to say.

01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:36.000
Let's move on.

01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:38.000
Let's do, can we do something lighthearted, please?

01:51:38.000 --> 01:51:40.000
How about a rumor? How about a good old

01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:42.000
gaming rumor? All right. Good.

01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:44.000
When we need to, when we need to lighten

01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:46.000
the tone a little bit, let's do, either we get Mr. Smoosh

01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:48.000
on camera, but that's his choice, or

01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:50.000
we talk about gaming rumors. So,

01:51:50.000 --> 01:51:52.000
let's talk about a

01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:54.000
patent that was filed by Microsoft recently

01:51:54.000 --> 01:51:56.000
to turn your smartphone

01:51:56.000 --> 01:51:58.000
into a gaming device.

01:51:58.000 --> 01:52:00.000
Huh. That's kind of interesting.

01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:02.000
So, there was a patent that was put in last month,

01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:04.000
and it's actually

01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:06.000
detailing a charging device

01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:08.000
for removable input modules.

01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:10.000
So, the patent isn't for this controller,

01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:12.000
but you can kind of see this controller in the mock-ups.

01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:14.000
So, basically, imagine

01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:16.000
I were to take my cell phone,

01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:18.000
okay, and I would actually plug in,

01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:20.000
think like Switch-style joy-cons

01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:22.000
on the left side and the right side,

01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:24.000
but something that a little bit more resembled

01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:26.000
a Xbox One

01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:28.000
gamepad. That's kind of what

01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:30.000
it looks like for those of you that haven't seen the visuals

01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:32.000
yet. And there would be, of course,

01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:34.000
a number of color options in this patent,

01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:36.000
two halves of a controller,

01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:38.000
it clips around your smartphone.

01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:40.000
So, you know, and again, companies

01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:42.000
file patents all the time that they don't even use,

01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:44.000
so it may mean nothing, but

01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:46.000
what do we know?

01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:48.000
Microsoft's going to be making a big push into

01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:50.000
cloud streaming and all that stuff, right?

01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:52.000
Microsoft doesn't exactly have the Windows phone

01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:54.000
stuff, really, like they used to have,

01:52:54.000 --> 01:52:56.000
so it makes sense for them to partner up with Android

01:52:56.000 --> 01:52:58.000
and iOS,

01:52:58.000 --> 01:53:00.000
which Apple has

01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:02.000
really been, Google to some extent, too, has really

01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:04.000
been lacking some type of official gaming

01:53:04.000 --> 01:53:06.000
controller that could really make

01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:08.000
things more playable on those

01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:10.000
screens, right, because everything on those

01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:12.000
systems is touch, which is fine

01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:14.000
when the games are designed for touch,

01:53:14.000 --> 01:53:16.000
like Pokemon Go or something,

01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:18.000
but Xbox 360 and

01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:20.000
Xbox One games are not designed for touch,

01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:22.000
so it makes sense that you would have this little controller

01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:24.000
or whatever, but I gotta

01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:26.000
say, if this ends up being true,

01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:28.000
what a clever little idea on

01:53:28.000 --> 01:53:30.000
Microsoft's part to basically,

01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:32.000
because it's going to be a lot cheaper than selling you

01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:34.000
something like a PlayStation Vita. This is not

01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:36.000
a PlayStation Vita, this is almost

01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:38.000
certainly something that's going to tie

01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:40.000
into xCloud and

01:53:40.000 --> 01:53:42.000
Microsoft's streaming services

01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:44.000
to allow you to play Xbox One

01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:46.000
games and others like that.

01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:48.000
Not even that, or just streaming from your

01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:50.000
console, well yeah, I remember that xCloud was

01:53:50.000 --> 01:53:52.000
also the streaming from console, kind of like

01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:54.000
how they did with the remote play stuff, but

01:53:54.000 --> 01:53:56.000
you know, something similar,

01:53:56.000 --> 01:53:58.000
sounds like.

01:53:58.000 --> 01:54:00.000
Yeah, so anyway,

01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:02.000
and it should be noted that some of

01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:04.000
the designs we're seeing out there are mockups

01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:06.000
and so forth, they are not,

01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:08.000
they're based on the patents, but they're not necessarily

01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:10.000
from the patents, so please be careful

01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:12.000
with what you see out there.

01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:14.000
However, it is very,

01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:16.000
sorry, I have coughs,

01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:18.000
it is very interesting that Microsoft

01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:20.000
is looking at doing this, it makes a lot of sense

01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:22.000
for what could their direction be

01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:24.000
when it comes to the cloud and all this,

01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:26.000
you know, and how they're going to

01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:28.000
solve the issue of gaming on the go,

01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:30.000
but not necessarily like, you know,

01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:32.000
on your

01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:34.000
phone, but with your phone. Yeah, it's not like

01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:36.000
a dedicated device, it's just

01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:38.000
you know, its own

01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:40.000
thing that can attach to tablets. So

01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:42.000
SJ100Matt points out that Asus has a phone that's

01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:44.000
almost like this, it's a gaming cell phone, it's

01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:46.000
called the Asus ROG.

01:54:46.000 --> 01:54:48.000
You know, and he says

01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:50.000
it's pretty amazing, and I bet it is pretty amazing, but

01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:52.000
still, also interesting

01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:54.000
in a way, I think, that you know, if you get

01:54:54.000 --> 01:54:56.000
Microsoft and something of that caliber

01:54:56.000 --> 01:54:58.000
behind this, and Microsoft says, this

01:54:58.000 --> 01:55:00.000
is the solution we are endorsing, so you can

01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:02.000
play Halo, you can play

01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:04.000
Sea of Thieves, you can play whatever

01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:06.000
on Project

01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:08.000
Scorpio and all this stuff, you know,

01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:10.000
if they like roll this out at the same time, this could be very,

01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:12.000
very big. And it's an

01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:14.000
interesting way to kind of address

01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:16.000
the Switch thing, like

01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:18.000
playing it on your, but without

01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:20.000
necessarily putting out a clone of the Switch.

01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:22.000
Well, and eventually, when we get 5G

01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:24.000
rolled out everywhere, and then you have

01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:26.000
unlimited plans and stuff like that,

01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:28.000
then it makes this type of gaming

01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:30.000
feasible on the go.

01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:32.000
Now, Dr. Tetsuya said earlier

01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:34.000
in our chat, saying, I have to wonder if

01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:36.000
Tommy Tallarico has heard about this, it sort of

01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:38.000
sounds up the alley from what

01:55:38.000 --> 01:55:40.000
he was looking into for extra Amico

01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:42.000
controllers, that comment from our

01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:44.000
Twitch channel at twitch.tv slash vognetwork

01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:46.000
as we tape live here on Sunday night.

01:55:46.000 --> 01:55:48.000
But, yeah.

01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:50.000
Aren't we getting something Amico-related from

01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:52.000
Gamescom as well?

01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:54.000
Well, we know they were kind of at

01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:56.000
E3, but we didn't get a lot out of that, besides

01:55:56.000 --> 01:55:58.000
some of the console designs, which look pretty

01:55:58.000 --> 01:56:00.000
hot, but I don't know if we know much about

01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:02.000
the games yet, maybe we'll get some of that out of

01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:04.000
Gamescom, but I still feel like Intellivision's a big

01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:06.000
question mark on a lot of things, but

01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:08.000
they're not out until, what was their day,

01:56:08.000 --> 01:56:10.000
10-10-2020 or something like that was their big day.

01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:12.000
So, they've still got over a year to go,

01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:14.000
so I imagine we're not going to start seeing all the games

01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:16.000
just yet, so. Oh!

01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:18.000
Okay, Bobby's there to

01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:20.000
correct me, as usual, saying

01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:22.000
yes, the new trailer comes out at

01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:24.000
Gamescom with 14 games

01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:26.000
and the hardware, so apparently, I guess there was

01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:28.000
an announcement, I didn't see it. So,

01:56:28.000 --> 01:56:30.000
hmm, pretty cool.

01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:32.000
Yeah. Yeah. Anyway.

01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:34.000
Alright, so maybe

01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:36.000
that's something that'll show up. Well, I didn't see

01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:38.000
Intellivision on the list of who was showing up to

01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:40.000
Jeff Keighley's thing, but I guess they probably want to do their own thing

01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:42.000
if this is like the big reveal of the games.

01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:44.000
So curious what kind of games they got.

01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:46.000
So curious. I want to know if YYR

01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:48.000
got in or not, because you know if he did,

01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:50.000
he's not going to be able to talk about it even on this show.

01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:52.000
So, I'm just crossing my fingers on my toes

01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:54.000
for him, so. Alright, Bobby says

01:56:54.000 --> 01:56:56.000
it was supposed to be August 1st, but they delayed it

01:56:56.000 --> 01:56:58.000
to Gamescom. Well, that makes sense, you know.

01:56:58.000 --> 01:57:00.000
Why not? Why not kick it off with a

01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:02.000
big gaming show and show all of that?

01:57:02.000 --> 01:57:04.000
Alright, we are almost

01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:06.000
to your calls, if anybody wants to

01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:08.000
call in tonight at our Discord server, vognetwork.com,

01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:10.000
vognetwork.com slash

01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:12.000
Discord, but we have a couple more stories

01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:14.000
for you guys first, and Loki's about to

01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:16.000
make me very upset. Yes,

01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:18.000
isn't it so lovely how we talked

01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:20.000
last week about how the 2019

01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:22.000
E3

01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:24.000
attendees, you know, they went there and had

01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:26.000
all their information leaked and were like, see, this is

01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:28.000
why we don't go to E3. This doesn't

01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:30.000
affect us at all. And then they sent us a

01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:32.000
fucking email saying, hey, guess what? Hey,

01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:34.000
you went to E3 in 2006 or

01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:36.000
2004, we leaked your shit too.

01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:38.000
And wasn't I

01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:40.000
like sitting here going, thank God we haven't been

01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:42.000
in years and our stuff probably

01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:44.000
and God damn it. Although,

01:57:44.000 --> 01:57:46.000
I certainly wasn't

01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:48.000
media in 2004. I was

01:57:48.000 --> 01:57:50.000
a, we all went as guests of a

01:57:50.000 --> 01:57:52.000
major gaming company, which if you think back

01:57:52.000 --> 01:57:54.000
to what this show used to talk about

01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:56.000
that many years ago, almost exclusively,

01:57:56.000 --> 01:57:58.000
you can probably put two and two together

01:57:58.000 --> 01:58:00.000
and figure out what gaming company

01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:02.000
invited us, but that's neither here nor there.

01:58:02.000 --> 01:58:04.000
2006, but 2006, I don't think

01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:06.000
we went as media or did you get an email?

01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:08.000
I got an email. Oh no,

01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:10.000
I didn't get an email about that.

01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:12.000
Oh my

01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:14.000
God, I'm so mad. I don't remember. I thought

01:58:14.000 --> 01:58:16.000
we went as just general attendees and registered

01:58:16.000 --> 01:58:18.000
with the general public in 2005.

01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:20.000
No, we went as media.

01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:22.000
I mean, I

01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:24.000
have to check. I've got my badges in the garage,

01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:26.000
but yeah, no,

01:58:26.000 --> 01:58:28.000
I'm just now I'm finding this out for the first time. I thought

01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:30.000
we went as general. I didn't think we went as media until

01:58:30.000 --> 01:58:32.000
the All Games years. Well, that was 2006.

01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:34.000
After, no,

01:58:34.000 --> 01:58:36.000
we weren't with All Games in 2006.

01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:38.000
Were we? That was the

01:58:38.000 --> 01:58:40.000
2006 one because that's, that

01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:42.000
was Ridge Racer year.

01:58:42.000 --> 01:58:44.000
2006. I thought

01:58:44.000 --> 01:58:46.000
that came way later. No, that was the

01:58:46.000 --> 01:58:48.000
year that they did the PS3 announcement.

01:58:48.000 --> 01:58:50.000
Oh crap. Because

01:58:50.000 --> 01:58:52.000
Oh, that's right.

01:58:52.000 --> 01:58:54.000
Bobby says 2006 was the Arena

01:58:54.000 --> 01:58:56.000
Interactive Lounge year. Fuck,

01:58:56.000 --> 01:58:58.000
that's right. We were

01:58:58.000 --> 01:59:00.000
media that year.

01:59:00.000 --> 01:59:02.000
Oh no.

01:59:02.000 --> 01:59:04.000
No, I'm fucking mad now.

01:59:04.000 --> 01:59:06.000
I'm, well, my mailing

01:59:06.000 --> 01:59:08.000
address is my old company that's closed down.

01:59:08.000 --> 01:59:10.000
Yeah, all my information

01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:12.000
is like dirt old. Like,

01:59:12.000 --> 01:59:14.000
was I living with you in 2006?

01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:16.000
Uh, yeah. Yeah, so like,

01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:18.000
all that information is like dirt old by now.

01:59:18.000 --> 01:59:20.000
It's not like it's my current address or anything, but it's still,

01:59:20.000 --> 01:59:22.000
and I haven't gotten any like creepy, I think my phone

01:59:22.000 --> 01:59:24.000
number might have been different too.

01:59:24.000 --> 01:59:26.000
Oh yeah, because I probably registered with a home number

01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:28.000
which I don't even have anymore, because we had a

01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:30.000
home phone at that time, so yeah, that was probably

01:59:30.000 --> 01:59:32.000
our business phone.

01:59:32.000 --> 01:59:34.000
I want to say one year we like changed

01:59:34.000 --> 01:59:36.000
the message to say something like, you're

01:59:36.000 --> 01:59:38.000
calling OLR Studio. I feel

01:59:38.000 --> 01:59:40.000
like that was the year we did all that.

01:59:40.000 --> 01:59:42.000
So yeah, the good news

01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:44.000
is that all the information is going to be shit anyway.

01:59:44.000 --> 01:59:46.000
But it's still, it's

01:59:46.000 --> 01:59:48.000
infuriating. So here's how they, it actually

01:59:48.000 --> 01:59:50.000
leaked out. So it wasn't like someone hacked the

01:59:50.000 --> 01:59:52.000
site and found anything. It was actually archived

01:59:52.000 --> 01:59:54.000
by the internet archive.

01:59:54.000 --> 01:59:56.000
And it was just floating around out there

01:59:56.000 --> 01:59:58.000
for someone to access. If they access

01:59:58.000 --> 02:00:00.000
the archive page, they can get the full list of

02:00:00.000 --> 02:00:02.000
attendees from 2004 to 2006.

02:00:02.000 --> 02:00:04.000
How nice.

02:00:04.000 --> 02:00:06.000
Jason in chat says, old information is still

02:00:06.000 --> 02:00:08.000
relevant for credit reports and

02:00:08.000 --> 02:00:10.000
identity verifications, so, and

02:00:10.000 --> 02:00:12.000
says sorry. No, I mean, you're just being a realist.

02:00:12.000 --> 02:00:14.000
But that's like four or five addresses

02:00:14.000 --> 02:00:16.000
ago, so. It was a long time ago, but

02:00:16.000 --> 02:00:18.000
I mean, I'm not saying, oh it's

02:00:18.000 --> 02:00:20.000
okay, I don't care, because the information

02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:22.000
is so old. No, I'm

02:00:22.000 --> 02:00:24.000
fucking pissed off about it, and the

02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:26.000
ESA fucking sucks for what they did.

02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:28.000
And, you know, fucking, I

02:00:28.000 --> 02:00:30.000
hope there's a class action lawsuit and shit

02:00:30.000 --> 02:00:32.000
because this is inexcusable what they

02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:34.000
did. Like, please understand

02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:36.000
me very fucking explicitly on this. I'm

02:00:36.000 --> 02:00:38.000
not happy that this happened.

02:00:38.000 --> 02:00:40.000
I'm really not happy. So here's

02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:42.000
the statement that they put out in email. So it says

02:00:42.000 --> 02:00:44.000
I don't, I kind of don't give a fuck, like

02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:46.000
what they had to say, because it's, it's all it is

02:00:46.000 --> 02:00:48.000
going to be talk. Less talk,

02:00:48.000 --> 02:00:50.000
more action. Yeah, they're just blaming

02:00:50.000 --> 02:00:52.000
their, well the files weren't hosted on the

02:00:52.000 --> 02:00:54.000
servers or on the current website. We took

02:00:54.000 --> 02:00:56.000
immediate action to remove those files.

02:00:56.000 --> 02:00:58.000
They were cached on third party Internet Archive

02:00:58.000 --> 02:01:00.000
site. We're working with our partners and

02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:02.000
outside counsel, independent experts to investigate

02:01:02.000 --> 02:01:04.000
what led to this situation to enhance

02:01:04.000 --> 02:01:06.000
our security efforts.

02:01:06.000 --> 02:01:08.000
So,

02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:10.000
you know, what can

02:01:10.000 --> 02:01:12.000
they do? I don't know, put any

02:01:12.000 --> 02:01:14.000
security on there because there was literally none.

02:01:14.000 --> 02:01:16.000
So, that's a start.

02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:18.000
But, yeah.

02:01:18.000 --> 02:01:20.000
So that was it, because I saw that

02:01:20.000 --> 02:01:22.000
in my email. I'm like, uh,

02:01:22.000 --> 02:01:24.000
why am I getting this?

02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:26.000
So fucking mad. PixelPockets

02:01:26.000 --> 02:01:28.000
in chat says ESA statements on this are

02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:30.000
so eye rolling. They are at fault.

02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:32.000
If the files were archived, they were

02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:34.000
up on the site at some point because they put

02:01:34.000 --> 02:01:36.000
them there. Sounds, and Bob Coffee says

02:01:36.000 --> 02:01:38.000
sounds like PR bullshit. It is.

02:01:38.000 --> 02:01:40.000
Nifty805

02:01:40.000 --> 02:01:42.000
says Rob is ready to out rant Loki tonight.

02:01:42.000 --> 02:01:44.000
I'm, yeah, I'm pissed about

02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:46.000
this. This is way, this is way more

02:01:46.000 --> 02:01:48.000
serious than, like, Nintendo not getting

02:01:48.000 --> 02:01:50.000
online or whatever shit Loki rants about

02:01:50.000 --> 02:01:52.000
in a week. Sorry, Loki. But this

02:01:52.000 --> 02:01:54.000
is, like, this is far more important than

02:01:54.000 --> 02:01:56.000
any of that. And it's, it's just,

02:01:56.000 --> 02:01:58.000
it's so infuriating because, again, the ESA's

02:01:58.000 --> 02:02:00.000
not really talking action. They're just

02:02:00.000 --> 02:02:02.000
talking about, like, it's not our fault.

02:02:02.000 --> 02:02:04.000
Like, it was, and it's just, like,

02:02:04.000 --> 02:02:06.000
fucking accountability, bitch.

02:02:06.000 --> 02:02:08.000
Like,

02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:10.000
I'm so mad.

02:02:10.000 --> 02:02:12.000
But what can you do? What can

02:02:12.000 --> 02:02:14.000
you do? Like, you feel helpless about the whole

02:02:14.000 --> 02:02:16.000
thing. It's like if this, the company's not leaking

02:02:16.000 --> 02:02:18.000
your information, it's somebody else leaking

02:02:18.000 --> 02:02:20.000
your credit information or whatever. It's, like,

02:02:20.000 --> 02:02:22.000
why do we have credit

02:02:22.000 --> 02:02:24.000
information anymore? It's just, it's all public

02:02:24.000 --> 02:02:26.000
anyway, apparently. Yeah. So

02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:28.000
ridiculous.

02:02:28.000 --> 02:02:30.000
QuestBuster

02:02:30.000 --> 02:02:32.000
and chat. ESA. So, we need to

02:02:32.000 --> 02:02:34.000
spend money to secure this stuff. Just hide it in a

02:02:34.000 --> 02:02:36.000
folder or something. Barf.

02:02:36.000 --> 02:02:38.000
But I get it. It's

02:02:38.000 --> 02:02:40.000
negligence. Absolutely. That's what I'm saying.

02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:42.000
You're a fucking tech company. You

02:02:42.000 --> 02:02:44.000
represent the tech industry.

02:02:44.000 --> 02:02:46.000
Not a good look when you're supposed to be representing

02:02:46.000 --> 02:02:48.000
the tech industry.

02:02:48.000 --> 02:02:50.000
Anyway.

02:02:50.000 --> 02:02:52.000
Let's move on to something a little more.

02:02:52.000 --> 02:02:54.000
Let me find my happy place by listening

02:02:54.000 --> 02:02:56.000
to some music. Okay?

02:02:56.000 --> 02:02:58.000
So, let's talk a little bit about the Mana

02:02:58.000 --> 02:03:00.000
series and, uh, the Mana

02:03:00.000 --> 02:03:02.000
soundtracks, meaning, like, secret

02:03:02.000 --> 02:03:04.000
of Mana or trials of Mana as

02:03:04.000 --> 02:03:06.000
it is now. Square Enix has just

02:03:06.000 --> 02:03:08.000
put 13 soundtracks

02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:10.000
for the second Densetsu or

02:03:10.000 --> 02:03:12.000
Mana series on several different

02:03:12.000 --> 02:03:14.000
platforms including Apple Music,

02:03:14.000 --> 02:03:16.000
Spotify, Amazon Music

02:03:16.000 --> 02:03:18.000
and many more. Some of the

02:03:18.000 --> 02:03:20.000
soundtracks that are out now. Second Densetsu

02:03:20.000 --> 02:03:22.000
2, meaning Secret of Mana, the original

02:03:22.000 --> 02:03:24.000
soundtrack. Second Densetsu 3

02:03:24.000 --> 02:03:26.000
original soundtrack. Legend of Mana

02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:28.000
original soundtrack. Heroes of Mana.

02:03:28.000 --> 02:03:30.000
Rise of Mana. DS Children's of Mana.

02:03:30.000 --> 02:03:32.000
I mean, just pretty much all the

02:03:32.000 --> 02:03:34.000
second Densetsu and related Mana games you can think

02:03:34.000 --> 02:03:36.000
of. All of those soundtracks going up on

02:03:36.000 --> 02:03:38.000
Spotify and, uh, some great,

02:03:38.000 --> 02:03:40.000
some great music, some great tunes.

02:03:40.000 --> 02:03:42.000
So, um, a lot happier

02:03:42.000 --> 02:03:44.000
of a note to end on tonight.

02:03:44.000 --> 02:03:46.000
Well, I've got even better, uh, better

02:03:46.000 --> 02:03:48.000
note to end on tonight. Oh, you got some last minute news,

02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:50.000
do you? Yes. Well, good. I'll start bringing up Discord

02:03:50.000 --> 02:03:52.000
to see if anybody wants to call in tonight while you get into that.

02:03:52.000 --> 02:03:54.000
So, guess what game is getting a reboot?

02:03:54.000 --> 02:03:56.000
A reboot. A reboot.

02:03:56.000 --> 02:03:58.000
Okay, what? Cooking Mama.

02:03:58.000 --> 02:04:00.000
Oh, that's kind of fun.

02:04:00.000 --> 02:04:02.000
So, Cooking Mama's gonna be coming back to the

02:04:02.000 --> 02:04:04.000
Nintendo Switch. That's what I

02:04:04.000 --> 02:04:06.000
can tell the ESA. Don't worry.

02:04:06.000 --> 02:04:08.000
Mama will fix it. Thanks to

02:04:08.000 --> 02:04:10.000
Planet Digital Partners.

02:04:10.000 --> 02:04:12.000
As part of this, they're gonna have a brand new

02:04:12.000 --> 02:04:14.000
mode to go along with the regular recipes.

02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:16.000
It's basically a vegetarian

02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:18.000
mode. So, for people that don't want to

02:04:18.000 --> 02:04:20.000
cook anything that has meat ingredients,

02:04:20.000 --> 02:04:22.000
you won't have to. You can just switch to the

02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:24.000
vegetarian mode and cook all

02:04:24.000 --> 02:04:26.000
the vegetarian recipes. That's cute.

02:04:26.000 --> 02:04:28.000
Yeah. For those that that's important

02:04:28.000 --> 02:04:30.000
to them, that's cute. It's an easy

02:04:30.000 --> 02:04:32.000
change to make, I suppose. Yep.

02:04:32.000 --> 02:04:34.000
Yeah. So, that's it. No

02:04:34.000 --> 02:04:36.000
word on when it's coming out yet, but

02:04:36.000 --> 02:04:38.000
pretty

02:04:38.000 --> 02:04:40.000
cool. I hope I say this name

02:04:40.000 --> 02:04:42.000
right. I'm sorry if I mispronounced it.

02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:44.000
Oh, in the fall. Oh, that's really

02:04:44.000 --> 02:04:46.000
soon. Yeah. Sorry if I mispronounced this name.

02:04:46.000 --> 02:04:48.000
Thower66. I'm sorry if I, or maybe

02:04:48.000 --> 02:04:50.000
it's just Thor, but spelled differently.

02:04:50.000 --> 02:04:52.000
I'm gonna say Thor. Thor66

02:04:52.000 --> 02:04:54.000
in chat says, Dark Sakura should be happy.

02:04:54.000 --> 02:04:56.000
I agreed. I'll have to let her know about

02:04:56.000 --> 02:04:58.000
it. And by the way, I believe Thor66

02:04:58.000 --> 02:05:00.000
in chat mentioned

02:05:00.000 --> 02:05:02.000
that they've been listening since the All Games

02:05:02.000 --> 02:05:04.000
days and, or, and even before that

02:05:04.000 --> 02:05:06.000
on Life 365 and I guess just

02:05:06.000 --> 02:05:08.000
rediscovered us here on Twitch. Yep. We're

02:05:08.000 --> 02:05:10.000
still here. We're still here. A little older.

02:05:10.000 --> 02:05:12.000
I got more gray, but we're here

02:05:12.000 --> 02:05:14.000
and doing this video thing now that we've been doing

02:05:14.000 --> 02:05:16.000
since December. So, um, yeah, it's

02:05:16.000 --> 02:05:18.000
a whole new world out there with video, but

02:05:18.000 --> 02:05:20.000
17 years, if you can believe it.

02:05:20.000 --> 02:05:22.000
It's a long time.

02:05:22.000 --> 02:05:24.000
Yeah. Almost as old as that ESA information

02:05:24.000 --> 02:05:26.000
that's leaked out almost

02:05:26.000 --> 02:05:28.000
past week. Jesus Christ.

02:05:28.000 --> 02:05:30.000
All right. PixelPaca says, what about vegan

02:05:30.000 --> 02:05:32.000
mama? Baby steps. Baby steps.

02:05:32.000 --> 02:05:34.000
They're gonna have Beyond Meat in there.

02:05:34.000 --> 02:05:36.000
Oh, maybe that's the hot new thing. I haven't tried

02:05:36.000 --> 02:05:38.000
that yet. The Beyond Meat. Yeah.

02:05:38.000 --> 02:05:40.000
That's beyond what I'm gonna try.

02:05:40.000 --> 02:05:42.000
I hear it's pretty good. No. I'll try

02:05:42.000 --> 02:05:44.000
it. What if it tastes like meat?

02:05:44.000 --> 02:05:46.000
No. I'm curious. I'm curious.

02:05:46.000 --> 02:05:48.000
But I heard, like, they're getting some crap.

02:05:48.000 --> 02:05:50.000
It's a slippery slope. Like Burger King is

02:05:50.000 --> 02:05:52.000
kind of getting crap because they cook it on the same grill that they

02:05:52.000 --> 02:05:54.000
cook the meat on. So it's kind of

02:05:54.000 --> 02:05:56.000
kind of defeats the purpose. Oh.

02:05:56.000 --> 02:05:58.000
Oh, yeah. Yes.

02:05:58.000 --> 02:06:00.000
That I get that. I thought

02:06:00.000 --> 02:06:02.000
I was like, what, is it going to make the burgers taste bad or something?

02:06:02.000 --> 02:06:04.000
Like, I don't understand the point is like, oh,

02:06:04.000 --> 02:06:06.000
yeah. If you're vegan, if you're vegetarian

02:06:06.000 --> 02:06:08.000
for, like, health reasons, what's that like?

02:06:08.000 --> 02:06:10.000
That was like when McDonald's used to, like,

02:06:10.000 --> 02:06:12.000
uh, fry their stuff in, like,

02:06:12.000 --> 02:06:14.000
beef fat or something like that. They used to

02:06:14.000 --> 02:06:16.000
have, like, some sort of, like, meat fat in there as

02:06:16.000 --> 02:06:18.000
well. Yeah. Lard or something. I don't know.

02:06:18.000 --> 02:06:20.000
Yeah. But their fries taste better then. I don't

02:06:20.000 --> 02:06:22.000
know. Uh, Jason in our chat says

02:06:22.000 --> 02:06:24.000
it doesn't taste like meat. It bleeds like meat.

02:06:24.000 --> 02:06:26.000
Yeah, I heard that was a thing, too.

02:06:26.000 --> 02:06:28.000
That it, like, actually will, like,

02:06:28.000 --> 02:06:30.000
bleed. I guess, I don't know what, if it's beets

02:06:30.000 --> 02:06:32.000
or something that it's using to make it look like

02:06:32.000 --> 02:06:34.000
it's bleeding. Yeah. Gross, right?

02:06:34.000 --> 02:06:36.000
But that's, yeah. Anyway.

02:06:36.000 --> 02:06:38.000
Alright, let's move on.

02:06:38.000 --> 02:06:40.000
Let's take some calls. We actually have somebody

02:06:40.000 --> 02:06:42.000
in the green room over on our Discord

02:06:42.000 --> 02:06:44.000
server, so let's get to a call tonight.

02:06:44.000 --> 02:06:46.000
Hi, you are on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?

02:06:48.000 --> 02:06:50.000
Hey, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

02:06:50.000 --> 02:06:52.000
If you can hear me, we can't hear you. Hello.

02:06:52.000 --> 02:06:54.000
Hey, what's up, buddy?

02:06:54.000 --> 02:06:56.000
This is Act F. For some reason,

02:06:56.000 --> 02:06:58.000
I couldn't hear you, but okay.

02:06:58.000 --> 02:07:00.000
That's okay. We're here now. How you doing, Act F?

02:07:00.000 --> 02:07:02.000
What's on your mind, buddy?

02:07:02.000 --> 02:07:04.000
Well, there's lots and lots of my mind.

02:07:04.000 --> 02:07:06.000
Especially with what happened

02:07:06.000 --> 02:07:08.000
last weekend.

02:07:08.000 --> 02:07:10.000
And how it happened, especially.

02:07:12.000 --> 02:07:14.000
But, other than that,

02:07:14.000 --> 02:07:16.000
you talked about

02:07:16.000 --> 02:07:18.000
the Walmart story and

02:07:18.000 --> 02:07:20.000
how they tried to

02:07:20.000 --> 02:07:22.000
pretty much,

02:07:22.000 --> 02:07:24.000
like,

02:07:24.000 --> 02:07:26.000
don't know if they tried to fix

02:07:26.000 --> 02:07:28.000
something, to try to do something

02:07:28.000 --> 02:07:30.000
about it, but

02:07:30.000 --> 02:07:32.000
it was the most

02:07:32.000 --> 02:07:34.000
stupid

02:07:34.000 --> 02:07:36.000
way to do it. Like, oh my god.

02:07:36.000 --> 02:07:38.000
I'm actually, like,

02:07:38.000 --> 02:07:40.000
angry about it.

02:07:40.000 --> 02:07:42.000
Yeah, like, I'm irritated they're

02:07:42.000 --> 02:07:44.000
buying into this narrative

02:07:44.000 --> 02:07:46.000
that has no place

02:07:46.000 --> 02:07:48.000
in the discussion anyway

02:07:48.000 --> 02:07:50.000
when there is nothing to prove

02:07:50.000 --> 02:07:52.000
that any of these, you know,

02:07:52.000 --> 02:07:54.000
disgusting people that committed these acts

02:07:54.000 --> 02:07:56.000
whose names I cannot recall,

02:07:56.000 --> 02:07:58.000
nor do I wish to recall,

02:07:58.000 --> 02:08:00.000
that these people were gamers

02:08:00.000 --> 02:08:02.000
or playing video games or even influenced

02:08:02.000 --> 02:08:04.000
by games. And even if they did play

02:08:04.000 --> 02:08:06.000
a video game here and there, who

02:08:06.000 --> 02:08:08.000
doesn't play video games here and there these days?

02:08:08.000 --> 02:08:10.000
It's just, you know,

02:08:10.000 --> 02:08:12.000
it's just, it's, again, it's a scapegoat.

02:08:12.000 --> 02:08:14.000
Like, it's distracting from the real

02:08:14.000 --> 02:08:16.000
issue. You can say the same thing about, like,

02:08:16.000 --> 02:08:18.000
well, this person eats pizza, or the

02:08:18.000 --> 02:08:20.000
killer ate pizza, therefore pizza

02:08:20.000 --> 02:08:22.000
has caused him to kill. Exactly, exactly.

02:08:22.000 --> 02:08:24.000
It's just trying to find, or they

02:08:24.000 --> 02:08:26.000
ate Beyond Burgers, and, you know,

02:08:26.000 --> 02:08:28.000
it's just... You hear that?

02:08:28.000 --> 02:08:30.000
That's a cause I'm willing to give up.

02:08:30.000 --> 02:08:32.000
Anyway, no, but, like, it's just,

02:08:32.000 --> 02:08:34.000
it is gross, and it makes me angry, like,

02:08:34.000 --> 02:08:36.000
as a gamer and somebody who's tried so

02:08:36.000 --> 02:08:38.000
hard over the years to promote maybe, like, a more

02:08:38.000 --> 02:08:40.000
positive gamer culture, and, like,

02:08:40.000 --> 02:08:42.000
positivity in gaming, like, it's just, it's

02:08:42.000 --> 02:08:44.000
really irritating to get

02:08:44.000 --> 02:08:46.000
this kind of garbage. And I'm not

02:08:46.000 --> 02:08:48.000
gonna say the gaming scene's already been, always

02:08:48.000 --> 02:08:50.000
been perfect, but, like, this is garbage

02:08:50.000 --> 02:08:52.000
stuff that we don't deserve to be

02:08:52.000 --> 02:08:54.000
associated with, you know?

02:08:54.000 --> 02:08:56.000
And, and, and especially because

02:08:56.000 --> 02:08:58.000
I could probably talk about

02:08:58.000 --> 02:09:00.000
the, the,

02:09:00.000 --> 02:09:02.000
and this, this is the most

02:09:02.000 --> 02:09:04.000
worrying thing about

02:09:04.000 --> 02:09:06.000
how it happened, because it was

02:09:06.000 --> 02:09:08.000
a racial thing. It was,

02:09:08.000 --> 02:09:10.000
the...

02:09:10.000 --> 02:09:12.000
I really don't wanna talk about it that

02:09:12.000 --> 02:09:14.000
much, but... No, I get it. It's,

02:09:14.000 --> 02:09:16.000
it's fucking infuriating, and

02:09:16.000 --> 02:09:18.000
we get it. Like, we totally,

02:09:18.000 --> 02:09:20.000
like, it's, I'm disgusted.

02:09:20.000 --> 02:09:22.000
As, as, you're disgusted.

02:09:22.000 --> 02:09:24.000
We're all disgusted. But, but, yeah, like,

02:09:24.000 --> 02:09:26.000
always, oh,

02:09:26.000 --> 02:09:28.000
video games have the, are the problem,

02:09:28.000 --> 02:09:30.000
or this is the problem.

02:09:30.000 --> 02:09:32.000
And they're not, no, nobody

02:09:32.000 --> 02:09:34.000
is doing, like, at least

02:09:34.000 --> 02:09:36.000
in, in the people who have the power,

02:09:36.000 --> 02:09:38.000
who have the means, and,

02:09:38.000 --> 02:09:40.000
and all that,

02:09:40.000 --> 02:09:42.000
to do something, aren't doing anything.

02:09:42.000 --> 02:09:44.000
Which is the most baffling.

02:09:44.000 --> 02:09:46.000
It's like... It's very

02:09:46.000 --> 02:09:48.000
simple. Video games do not

02:09:48.000 --> 02:09:50.000
teach racism. That comes

02:09:50.000 --> 02:09:52.000
from somewhere else. And

02:09:52.000 --> 02:09:54.000
that El Paso attack was

02:09:54.000 --> 02:09:56.000
racism.

02:09:56.000 --> 02:09:58.000
Right? Yeah, definitely.

02:09:58.000 --> 02:10:00.000
They didn't learn that in a video game.

02:10:00.000 --> 02:10:02.000
I don't know. I did learn

02:10:02.000 --> 02:10:04.000
that Skyrim is only for the Nords.

02:10:04.000 --> 02:10:06.000
Not even the time to joke. Not

02:10:06.000 --> 02:10:08.000
even the time. Like, it's just,

02:10:08.000 --> 02:10:10.000
it's, it's, it's, like,

02:10:10.000 --> 02:10:12.000
let's call it what it is. It was a racially

02:10:12.000 --> 02:10:14.000
motivated attack that no

02:10:14.000 --> 02:10:16.000
video game fucking taught them.

02:10:16.000 --> 02:10:18.000
No, and,

02:10:18.000 --> 02:10:20.000
and so many, and that's

02:10:20.000 --> 02:10:22.000
a cool thing about the video game

02:10:22.000 --> 02:10:24.000
community. Because that,

02:10:24.000 --> 02:10:26.000
all that happened the

02:10:26.000 --> 02:10:28.000
same time EVO was happening.

02:10:28.000 --> 02:10:30.000
And so many people there were having

02:10:30.000 --> 02:10:32.000
such a great time.

02:10:32.000 --> 02:10:34.000
We even see, like, the

02:10:34.000 --> 02:10:36.000
competition level, that

02:10:36.000 --> 02:10:38.000
many people can get salty,

02:10:38.000 --> 02:10:40.000
and probably get mad at the

02:10:40.000 --> 02:10:42.000
other that they won,

02:10:42.000 --> 02:10:44.000
they lost. But even

02:10:44.000 --> 02:10:46.000
then, we have, like, people like

02:10:46.000 --> 02:10:48.000
SonicFox and Goichi, if

02:10:48.000 --> 02:10:50.000
anyone in, like, you or in chat

02:10:50.000 --> 02:10:52.000
saw the Dragon Ball

02:10:52.000 --> 02:10:54.000
Fighter finals. They were, like,

02:10:54.000 --> 02:10:56.000
like, really

02:10:56.000 --> 02:10:58.000
good pals from, like,

02:10:58.000 --> 02:11:00.000
for many years. And they have probably

02:11:00.000 --> 02:11:02.000
met, like, in the past two years.

02:11:02.000 --> 02:11:04.000
And they were having a great time.

02:11:04.000 --> 02:11:06.000
So many people there that

02:11:06.000 --> 02:11:08.000
that were

02:11:08.000 --> 02:11:10.000
for the games, and not because

02:11:10.000 --> 02:11:12.000
oh, I'm better than you, and

02:11:12.000 --> 02:11:14.000
or

02:11:14.000 --> 02:11:16.000
other stupid stuff that can probably

02:11:16.000 --> 02:11:18.000
trigger something like that.

02:11:18.000 --> 02:11:20.000
But no, like, really

02:11:20.000 --> 02:11:22.000
people have to

02:11:22.000 --> 02:11:24.000
see the bigger picture, like,

02:11:24.000 --> 02:11:26.000
at all, because

02:11:26.000 --> 02:11:28.000
again, this is really frustrating

02:11:28.000 --> 02:11:30.000
because it's coming from, like,

02:11:30.000 --> 02:11:32.000
a sort of personal

02:11:32.000 --> 02:11:34.000
thing, and

02:11:34.000 --> 02:11:36.000
but, again, it's

02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:38.000
like, people

02:11:38.000 --> 02:11:40.000
and

02:11:40.000 --> 02:11:42.000
you have to do something.

02:11:42.000 --> 02:11:44.000
Call your representatives.

02:11:44.000 --> 02:11:46.000
Like,

02:11:46.000 --> 02:11:48.000
call for

02:11:48.000 --> 02:11:50.000
something to be done

02:11:50.000 --> 02:11:52.000
because

02:11:52.000 --> 02:11:54.000
Walmart pulling, like, stuff

02:11:54.000 --> 02:11:56.000
and again, it's just stupid stuff.

02:11:56.000 --> 02:11:58.000
It's, again, frustrating that they did

02:11:58.000 --> 02:12:00.000
that because, oh, my God,

02:12:00.000 --> 02:12:02.000
it happened to

02:12:02.000 --> 02:12:04.000
because of this, and maybe

02:12:04.000 --> 02:12:06.000
because of this, not necessarily

02:12:06.000 --> 02:12:08.000
because of it.

02:12:08.000 --> 02:12:10.000
Yeah, you know, I'm fortunate that I live in a state

02:12:10.000 --> 02:12:12.000
where we're represented by people

02:12:12.000 --> 02:12:14.000
in Congress that are very much, like,

02:12:14.000 --> 02:12:16.000
trying to

02:12:16.000 --> 02:12:18.000
fight this and make something happen.

02:12:18.000 --> 02:12:20.000
For example, one of our senators here

02:12:20.000 --> 02:12:22.000
from California you may have heard of before,

02:12:22.000 --> 02:12:24.000
her name's Kamala Harris, and she has lots

02:12:24.000 --> 02:12:26.000
to say about these different issues. And again, I'm not

02:12:26.000 --> 02:12:28.000
going to wade into politics because I understand,

02:12:28.000 --> 02:12:30.000
but the reality is, like, you know,

02:12:30.000 --> 02:12:32.000
I do feel like at least, you know,

02:12:32.000 --> 02:12:34.000
but that doesn't mean I shouldn't call them and at least

02:12:34.000 --> 02:12:36.000
kind of support in the direction that they're going,

02:12:36.000 --> 02:12:38.000
but, you know, it is, it's like

02:12:38.000 --> 02:12:40.000
we told the story about the governor that got

02:12:40.000 --> 02:12:42.000
drowned out when he was trying to give the speech

02:12:42.000 --> 02:12:44.000
to do something, and then finally, how about

02:12:44.000 --> 02:12:46.000
that, it made it, it made an attempt,

02:12:46.000 --> 02:12:48.000
there was an attempt

02:12:48.000 --> 02:12:50.000
to do something, finally.

02:12:50.000 --> 02:12:52.000
So, you know, it's that, it's really

02:12:52.000 --> 02:12:54.000
pissed off people that are going to make the difference.

02:12:54.000 --> 02:12:56.000
And, you know, as a gamer,

02:12:56.000 --> 02:12:58.000
I'm sitting here, and I think a lot of us have to

02:12:58.000 --> 02:13:00.000
sit here going, hell no, you're not

02:13:00.000 --> 02:13:02.000
pinning this on us. This is not

02:13:02.000 --> 02:13:04.000
our fault.

02:13:04.000 --> 02:13:06.000
Period.

02:13:06.000 --> 02:13:08.000
And, yeah, we, as

02:13:08.000 --> 02:13:10.000
us people, even like

02:13:10.000 --> 02:13:12.000
me living in Mexico, I have to,

02:13:12.000 --> 02:13:14.000
at least I feel like the obligation

02:13:14.000 --> 02:13:16.000
to do, like, something, at least

02:13:16.000 --> 02:13:18.000
spread the word. But, yeah,

02:13:18.000 --> 02:13:20.000
hopefully, things will get better.

02:13:20.000 --> 02:13:22.000
Hopefully, I

02:13:22.000 --> 02:13:24.000
want to be, like, really positive about it, but,

02:13:24.000 --> 02:13:26.000
like, again,

02:13:26.000 --> 02:13:28.000
this time was, like, wow,

02:13:28.000 --> 02:13:30.000
I cannot even

02:13:30.000 --> 02:13:32.000
fathom, I cannot imagine,

02:13:32.000 --> 02:13:34.000
like, the horror,

02:13:34.000 --> 02:13:36.000
the horror that people

02:13:36.000 --> 02:13:38.000
that are like me

02:13:38.000 --> 02:13:40.000
lived through that, like, oh my god.

02:13:40.000 --> 02:13:42.000
At some point,

02:13:42.000 --> 02:13:44.000
for what little relief it is, and I

02:13:44.000 --> 02:13:46.000
mean little relief, at some

02:13:46.000 --> 02:13:48.000
point, this generation

02:13:48.000 --> 02:13:50.000
that has had to grow up with metal

02:13:50.000 --> 02:13:52.000
detectors in schools, bulletproof

02:13:52.000 --> 02:13:54.000
backpacks, drills

02:13:54.000 --> 02:13:56.000
on what to do with an active shooter,

02:13:56.000 --> 02:13:58.000
and things that I can't even

02:13:58.000 --> 02:14:00.000
imagine going through. Like, I remember

02:14:00.000 --> 02:14:02.000
the earthquake grill was the scariest thing I went

02:14:02.000 --> 02:14:04.000
through when I was seven years old. Think about the

02:14:04.000 --> 02:14:06.000
bullshit kids today have to deal with.

02:14:06.000 --> 02:14:08.000
What little solace there is, is that

02:14:08.000 --> 02:14:10.000
someday, that generation

02:14:10.000 --> 02:14:12.000
that had to grow up with all that

02:14:12.000 --> 02:14:14.000
bullshit is going to be the one

02:14:14.000 --> 02:14:16.000
that is holding office

02:14:16.000 --> 02:14:18.000
and making decisions. And do you

02:14:18.000 --> 02:14:20.000
think that folks that are that young,

02:14:20.000 --> 02:14:22.000
in fact, in general, folks

02:14:22.000 --> 02:14:24.000
under 30, and I'm very much generalizing

02:14:24.000 --> 02:14:26.000
because there's folks older than that,

02:14:26.000 --> 02:14:28.000
like myself, that definitely agree

02:14:28.000 --> 02:14:30.000
that something needs to be done, but the reality is, as

02:14:30.000 --> 02:14:32.000
these younger folks that have had to grow

02:14:32.000 --> 02:14:34.000
up in this culture and all this

02:14:34.000 --> 02:14:36.000
bullshit around them is going to someday be

02:14:36.000 --> 02:14:38.000
the ones in charge, things will

02:14:38.000 --> 02:14:40.000
change. It's just

02:14:40.000 --> 02:14:42.000
not changing fast enough,

02:14:42.000 --> 02:14:44.000
unfortunately.

02:14:44.000 --> 02:14:46.000
Yeah, we just have to wait,

02:14:46.000 --> 02:14:48.000
be patient, and hope

02:14:48.000 --> 02:14:50.000
for the best. That's definitely

02:14:50.000 --> 02:14:52.000
the thing we can probably do

02:14:52.000 --> 02:14:54.000
right now, but yeah, we need to

02:14:54.000 --> 02:14:56.000
speak up. Like, not as gamers,

02:14:56.000 --> 02:14:58.000
not as hobbyists,

02:14:58.000 --> 02:15:00.000
but as people.

02:15:00.000 --> 02:15:02.000
Absolutely.

02:15:02.000 --> 02:15:04.000
I'm with you 100% on that.

02:15:04.000 --> 02:15:06.000
Act Deaf. I'm glad it's something that, you know,

02:15:06.000 --> 02:15:08.000
despite the fact that we are from two different countries,

02:15:08.000 --> 02:15:10.000
it's something that kind of we can come together

02:15:10.000 --> 02:15:12.000
and agree on. So, I appreciate your

02:15:12.000 --> 02:15:14.000
call very much, my friend, so

02:15:14.000 --> 02:15:16.000
take care. And hey, I

02:15:16.000 --> 02:15:18.000
heard your podcast kind of made a move this week.

02:15:18.000 --> 02:15:20.000
Yeah,

02:15:20.000 --> 02:15:22.000
GFMcast, we're

02:15:22.000 --> 02:15:24.000
sorry, we're still transmitting on

02:15:24.000 --> 02:15:26.000
YouTube, but

02:15:26.000 --> 02:15:28.000
since Google Hangouts is

02:15:28.000 --> 02:15:30.000
just pretty much dead

02:15:30.000 --> 02:15:32.000
for the most part,

02:15:32.000 --> 02:15:34.000
we're doing some changes

02:15:34.000 --> 02:15:36.000
and maybe in the future

02:15:36.000 --> 02:15:38.000
we'll move to Twitch

02:15:38.000 --> 02:15:40.000
too. It depends on how

02:15:40.000 --> 02:15:42.000
YouTube acts in the following months, but

02:15:42.000 --> 02:15:44.000
for now, we're

02:15:44.000 --> 02:15:46.000
sticking to YouTube. You can

02:15:46.000 --> 02:15:48.000
check us out if you like or you speak

02:15:48.000 --> 02:15:50.000
Spanish.

02:15:50.000 --> 02:15:52.000
Anyone, GFMcast or

02:15:52.000 --> 02:15:54.000
JefemeCast on YouTube.

02:15:54.000 --> 02:15:56.000
We also have GFMcast.com

02:15:56.000 --> 02:15:58.000
so you can check out all our episodes.

02:15:58.000 --> 02:16:00.000
All right. Wonderful. For our Spanish

02:16:00.000 --> 02:16:02.000
speaking audience, I would highly recommend it

02:16:02.000 --> 02:16:04.000
simply because I don't know anybody else

02:16:04.000 --> 02:16:06.000
that does a Spanish speaking podcast that listens

02:16:06.000 --> 02:16:08.000
to this show, and I really

02:16:08.000 --> 02:16:10.000
wish I could listen and, you know,

02:16:10.000 --> 02:16:12.000
be able to participate, but

02:16:12.000 --> 02:16:14.000
all I can do is support you from a distance, my friend.

02:16:14.000 --> 02:16:16.000
Hey, no problem. Thanks for the

02:16:16.000 --> 02:16:18.000
plug. Yeah. Anytime.

02:16:18.000 --> 02:16:20.000
Take care, buddy. You too.

02:16:20.000 --> 02:16:22.000
All right. Well, that's the only

02:16:22.000 --> 02:16:24.000
call that was waiting in the green room for us tonight,

02:16:24.000 --> 02:16:26.000
so we're going to go ahead and probably

02:16:26.000 --> 02:16:28.000
close down Discord at this point,

02:16:28.000 --> 02:16:30.000
but thank you to ActDeft. If somebody else

02:16:30.000 --> 02:16:32.000
decided they wanted to get in and got

02:16:32.000 --> 02:16:34.000
a little shy or whatever and didn't end up calling

02:16:34.000 --> 02:16:36.000
in, you can always send us an email, of course.

02:16:36.000 --> 02:16:38.000
Participate at Orangelaungerator.com

02:16:38.000 --> 02:16:40.000
or you can send us a tweet, Twitter.com

02:16:40.000 --> 02:16:42.000
slash O-L-R. Those are

02:16:42.000 --> 02:16:44.000
all great ways to contact the show

02:16:44.000 --> 02:16:46.000
as well. Do we have any

02:16:46.000 --> 02:16:48.000
last minute stories

02:16:48.000 --> 02:16:50.000
as we start to wrap

02:16:50.000 --> 02:16:52.000
up tonight? No, that was pretty much it.

02:16:52.000 --> 02:16:54.000
Yeah, that was a big one. That's Cookie Mama's return.

02:16:54.000 --> 02:16:56.000
That's a pretty big one. Later this fall,

02:16:56.000 --> 02:16:58.000
so we'll have to see. All right. Then I guess

02:16:58.000 --> 02:17:00.000
we will start to wrap up a little bit

02:17:00.000 --> 02:17:02.000
here, so thank you, as always,

02:17:02.000 --> 02:17:04.000
for joining us. Whether you are here live

02:17:04.000 --> 02:17:06.000
on Twitch or listening on our podcast

02:17:06.000 --> 02:17:08.000
feed or finding episodes

02:17:08.000 --> 02:17:10.000
over at VoGnetwork.com.

02:17:10.000 --> 02:17:12.000
Really appreciate

02:17:12.000 --> 02:17:14.000
all the different ways

02:17:14.000 --> 02:17:16.000
that you guys

02:17:16.000 --> 02:17:18.000
participate with our show and

02:17:18.000 --> 02:17:20.000
listen to us and support us.

02:17:20.000 --> 02:17:22.000
All we say is, you know,

02:17:22.000 --> 02:17:24.000
although we really appreciate the subs

02:17:24.000 --> 02:17:26.000
here at VoGnetwork and the bitty

02:17:26.000 --> 02:17:28.000
donations, the bits and all that, we

02:17:28.000 --> 02:17:30.000
super appreciate all that. You know what?

02:17:30.000 --> 02:17:32.000
All you really have to do, all we ask,

02:17:32.000 --> 02:17:34.000
we don't need money, but

02:17:34.000 --> 02:17:36.000
if you tell a friend or two about the show, help us

02:17:36.000 --> 02:17:38.000
spread the word because we are the show where every gamer

02:17:38.000 --> 02:17:40.000
has a voice, but, you know, if the voices aren't

02:17:40.000 --> 02:17:42.000
here, if they're not in our Discord lobby waiting to call in

02:17:42.000 --> 02:17:44.000
or in our chat room giving us feedback,

02:17:44.000 --> 02:17:46.000
we can't put them out on the air. We can't have

02:17:46.000 --> 02:17:48.000
that dialogue, so please

02:17:48.000 --> 02:17:50.000
help us spread the word. Word of mouth is so, so

02:17:50.000 --> 02:17:52.000
powerful. A nice five-star review

02:17:52.000 --> 02:17:54.000
on a site like iTunes or wherever

02:17:54.000 --> 02:17:56.000
you found this podcast. That stuff

02:17:56.000 --> 02:17:58.000
goes a very long way. Yes, I know

02:17:58.000 --> 02:18:00.000
we need to get on Spotify. We'll

02:18:00.000 --> 02:18:02.000
work on that in the very near future.

02:18:02.000 --> 02:18:04.000
In the meantime, though, it's about time

02:18:04.000 --> 02:18:06.000
to wrap up, so I guess we'll

02:18:06.000 --> 02:18:08.000
get around, go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

02:18:08.000 --> 02:18:10.000
Um, I'll start tonight. So my final thought is

02:18:10.000 --> 02:18:12.000
that Final Tribal Council's tomorrow

02:18:12.000 --> 02:18:14.000
night of this 51-day game I've been

02:18:14.000 --> 02:18:16.000
playing, and I'm just, I'm just,

02:18:16.000 --> 02:18:18.000
cross your fingers, like

02:18:18.000 --> 02:18:20.000
I would, I would really be honored to be the winner,

02:18:20.000 --> 02:18:22.000
but if I'm not, then it wasn't in the cards

02:18:22.000 --> 02:18:24.000
for that to happen. Are they supposed to have, like,

02:18:24.000 --> 02:18:26.000
this livestream or something like that? It's all

02:18:26.000 --> 02:18:28.000
going to be on YouTube, so I'll post the link to Twitter

02:18:28.000 --> 02:18:30.000
if you guys want to see it and watch, watch me

02:18:30.000 --> 02:18:32.000
get eaten alive by the jury and all that.

02:18:32.000 --> 02:18:34.000
Although, like, I'm trying to think back.

02:18:34.000 --> 02:18:36.000
At least, like, five of them,

02:18:36.000 --> 02:18:38.000
I think, wait, I'm thinking back in my mind.

02:18:38.000 --> 02:18:40.000
I think, like, five of them wrote my

02:18:40.000 --> 02:18:42.000
name down at some point, so they can't be too upset.

02:18:42.000 --> 02:18:44.000
But we'll see, we'll see how it goes.

02:18:44.000 --> 02:18:46.000
Uh, so we'll see how the, um,

02:18:46.000 --> 02:18:48.000
uh, Final Tribal goes tomorrow, but wish me luck.

02:18:48.000 --> 02:18:50.000
Cross your fingers. If I win,

02:18:50.000 --> 02:18:52.000
you know the, I told you the prize I get if I win, right?

02:18:52.000 --> 02:18:54.000
No. Oh. Uh, if I win,

02:18:54.000 --> 02:18:56.000
you get a blanket.

02:18:56.000 --> 02:18:58.000
And the blanket can have

02:18:58.000 --> 02:19:00.000
one of two things on it. You can have either the

02:19:00.000 --> 02:19:02.000
logo for the season, so I would get

02:19:02.000 --> 02:19:04.000
the, the power, because that's the name of the game,

02:19:04.000 --> 02:19:06.000
is Power Org, so I would get the Power Org

02:19:06.000 --> 02:19:08.000
logo on it, or the other option is to get

02:19:08.000 --> 02:19:10.000
your face on it.

02:19:10.000 --> 02:19:12.000
Now, Loki, you've known me a very long time.

02:19:12.000 --> 02:19:14.000
Which of those two am I going to be getting if I win?

02:19:14.000 --> 02:19:16.000
Oh, you're getting your face on it. I am absolutely getting the one with my face

02:19:16.000 --> 02:19:18.000
on it, so, uh, you will hopefully

02:19:18.000 --> 02:19:20.000
see that hanging here, if

02:19:20.000 --> 02:19:22.000
I am successful tomorrow night.

02:19:22.000 --> 02:19:24.000
Otherwise, uh, Felix

02:19:24.000 --> 02:19:26.000
out in Montreal, who's the other finalist,

02:19:26.000 --> 02:19:28.000
will get, I guess, I don't know if he's getting his

02:19:28.000 --> 02:19:30.000
face or what, but one of us is going to get

02:19:30.000 --> 02:19:32.000
that blanket, so we'll see what happens.

02:19:32.000 --> 02:19:34.000
So, alright, that's my final thought.

02:19:34.000 --> 02:19:36.000
Your final thought, Loki. My final thought is

02:19:36.000 --> 02:19:38.000
I'm still working on trying to come up

02:19:38.000 --> 02:19:40.000
with a game design for,

02:19:40.000 --> 02:19:42.000
um, whatever I'm supposed to be

02:19:42.000 --> 02:19:44.000
teaching kids about and stuff.

02:19:44.000 --> 02:19:46.000
I actually had some pretty decent, um,

02:19:46.000 --> 02:19:48.000
efforts on that, so we may see something

02:19:48.000 --> 02:19:50.000
on there. I did work on my game a little bit this week.

02:19:50.000 --> 02:19:52.000
Um, didn't get anywhere on that, because

02:19:52.000 --> 02:19:54.000
I'm still trying to get,

02:19:54.000 --> 02:19:56.000
I don't know, I had done this before

02:19:56.000 --> 02:19:58.000
in, like, a previous game I made, where

02:19:58.000 --> 02:20:00.000
I was, like, trying to lock the player to the

02:20:00.000 --> 02:20:02.000
screen, but now

02:20:02.000 --> 02:20:04.000
it's locking to the camera view, and

02:20:04.000 --> 02:20:06.000
it's not right, so I

02:20:06.000 --> 02:20:08.000
had to fix something in my code, because I can

02:20:08.000 --> 02:20:10.000
scroll out of the screen if I drag

02:20:10.000 --> 02:20:12.000
along the bottom, and it's not

02:20:12.000 --> 02:20:14.000
supposed to be doing that. That would be a glitch,

02:20:14.000 --> 02:20:16.000
so, um, still working

02:20:16.000 --> 02:20:18.000
on that. Thank you for all the

02:20:18.000 --> 02:20:20.000
love and chat, everybody. I'm feeling,

02:20:20.000 --> 02:20:22.000
I'm feeling the love, so. Alright,

02:20:22.000 --> 02:20:24.000
that's it. We're wrapped up for tonight.

02:20:24.000 --> 02:20:26.000
We'll be back next week for, um, our

02:20:26.000 --> 02:20:28.000
last live show of August, believe it or not,

02:20:28.000 --> 02:20:30.000
uh, with Dark Soccer here in

02:20:30.000 --> 02:20:32.000
studios, and then we're gonna be on a quick

02:20:32.000 --> 02:20:34.000
little, we'll have a pre-taped

02:20:34.000 --> 02:20:36.000
show again, uh, in two weeks

02:20:36.000 --> 02:20:38.000
on August the 25th, because, again,

02:20:38.000 --> 02:20:40.000
I'm flying out back east on the 24th,

02:20:40.000 --> 02:20:42.000
and then Labor Day weekend, uh,

02:20:42.000 --> 02:20:44.000
DragonCon will be going on, and we'll be hosting

02:20:44.000 --> 02:20:46.000
their panels. I don't think we have anything on

02:20:46.000 --> 02:20:48.000
Sunday night, maybe, I think there might have been a

02:20:48.000 --> 02:20:50.000
Sunday 5.30 thing, I don't know, I don't think we have

02:20:50.000 --> 02:20:52.000
anything, but, and I don't remember Bobby's

02:20:52.000 --> 02:20:54.000
schedule off the top of my head, but there will be

02:20:54.000 --> 02:20:56.000
some awesome panel that we'll be hosting that you

02:20:56.000 --> 02:20:58.000
can see instead next week live on

02:20:58.000 --> 02:21:00.000
Twitch, and for you podcast folk,

02:21:00.000 --> 02:21:02.000
we'll be back, um, um, live

02:21:02.000 --> 02:21:04.000
after that, uh, this, what, second

02:21:04.000 --> 02:21:06.000
weekend of September, I guess at that point, so.

02:21:06.000 --> 02:21:08.000
But we will be here next week, so don't,

02:21:08.000 --> 02:21:10.000
like, you know, don't, don't make new plans yet.

02:21:10.000 --> 02:21:12.000
We'll see you in seven days here on

02:21:12.000 --> 02:21:14.000
Twitch, and you guys get to find out if

02:21:14.000 --> 02:21:16.000
I won or not on that game.

02:21:16.000 --> 02:21:18.000
I will, I'll actually get to play some more

02:21:18.000 --> 02:21:20.000
video games this week. Maybe Loki will make

02:21:20.000 --> 02:21:22.000
progress on his game, I don't know. Alright.

02:21:22.000 --> 02:21:24.000
So, there you go. Uh, oh,

02:21:24.000 --> 02:21:26.000
Bobby reminding me that we watch the

02:21:26.000 --> 02:21:28.000
Masquerade and the VoG Suite on Sunday night

02:21:28.000 --> 02:21:30.000
at the normal time, that's technically our

02:21:30.000 --> 02:21:32.000
sweet party, you're right, that usually is kind of

02:21:32.000 --> 02:21:34.000
what's going on at that time, but there'll

02:21:34.000 --> 02:21:36.000
still be panels, like, podcasting,

02:21:36.000 --> 02:21:38.000
or, excuse me, digital media tracks still has panels

02:21:38.000 --> 02:21:40.000
that time, right? They might just do, that

02:21:40.000 --> 02:21:42.000
might be some of their big ballroom panels, like

02:21:42.000 --> 02:21:44.000
the, um, for

02:21:44.000 --> 02:21:46.000
Truce and a Lie, I'm screwing up these

02:21:46.000 --> 02:21:48.000
names of the shows, I'm sorry, there's that one

02:21:48.000 --> 02:21:50.000
Truce and a Lie panel, Night Attack is

02:21:50.000 --> 02:21:52.000
almost always there, they do something, and

02:21:52.000 --> 02:21:54.000
so they'll probably be a big ballroom thing, who knows.

02:21:54.000 --> 02:21:56.000
Anyway, yeah, Bobby says they'll have

02:21:56.000 --> 02:21:58.000
panels, we just won't be on them. Got it.

02:21:58.000 --> 02:22:00.000
Alright. Um,

02:22:00.000 --> 02:22:02.000
that's it. I guess, I guess

02:22:02.000 --> 02:22:04.000
we're done. Roll credits, right?
