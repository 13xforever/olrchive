00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,480
This week, how do you turn a retail business into a business for the future?

2
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:20,360
By laying off all the people that can help you accomplish it, apparently.

3
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:22,520
Our best wishes to those impacted by this news.

4
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:25,200
This is just one headline, stay tuned for the rest of the week's gaming news starting

5
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:28,280
right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.

6
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:37,160
Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of Orange

7
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:42,940
Lounge Radio, the show where every gamer has a voice, not live, on this lovely Sunday evening

8
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:45,880
with episode number 790 of our show.

9
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:49,620
But I'll explain a little bit more on that in a moment, but we still have some things

10
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:54,480
to go over, some news to discuss, some video games to play, gaming culture to cover, all

11
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:55,480
that good stuff.

12
00:00:55,480 --> 00:01:01,100
Myself, Rob Roberts, joining you here on Twitch TV, twitch.tv slash vog network where

13
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:06,280
we do broadcast, usually live, every Sunday night at 6 Pacific, 9 Eastern, although this

14
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:09,280
week has been prior recorded earlier in the week.

15
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,640
But it's going to feel like a little bit of a normal show, but maybe a little shorter

16
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:16,720
because it's already kind of late on a Thursday night here in Studio N7.

17
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:20,560
But joining me here on video for the show this week is Techmaster Loki.

18
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:21,560
Hello, I'm here.

19
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:22,560
Hi, how are you?

20
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,020
I'm full now.

21
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:25,740
That was some bomb ass chicken that you brought to the show.

22
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:26,740
It was some bomb ass chicken.

23
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:27,740
It's a bummer.

24
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:33,180
It took me a while to get set up for the pre-recording thing because that was some good chicken.

25
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:34,340
It was.

26
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:36,860
It was a Korean chicken, Korean grilled chicken?

27
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:41,420
It's supposed to be like Korean oven roasted chicken or oven, they also have fried chicken

28
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:47,980
as well, but it's like that one was a garlic chicken, which was garlic soy sauce and honey

29
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:48,980
or something.

30
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:51,580
But, oh my God, it was so good.

31
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:53,180
Like I'm already wanting to go back.

32
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:54,220
All right, it smelled good.

33
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:57,140
And I think Mr. Smoosh is going crazy over there about it too.

34
00:01:57,140 --> 00:02:02,460
You might see Mr. Smoosh cameo on cam tonight because there's an empty chair across there

35
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:06,900
because she's not here in studio tonight, Dark Soccer or Jamie Summers.

36
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:11,460
But thanks to the magic of the internet, she's joining us, as they say on the news, via satellite.

37
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:13,180
Dark Soccer, are you there?

38
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:17,020
I can't believe y'all haven't had Korean fried chicken before because that stuff is bomb.

39
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:20,940
I feel like I had it once, but it was a long time ago, but-

40
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:23,020
Did I ever take you to Bonchon?

41
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:24,780
I don't think I've been to Bonchon.

42
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:26,780
I know there's like, it's a chain now.

43
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:28,300
There's like a couple of those around.

44
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:32,460
No, the fried chicken I was all about recently was the halal fried chicken.

45
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:33,460
That's pretty good.

46
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:35,340
Oh man, that stuff is good.

47
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:40,180
If their fried chicken is, I don't know, this chicken is pretty good, so I do need to try

48
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:41,180
their fried chicken.

49
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:42,180
I'm excited.

50
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:43,180
Both of you.

51
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:45,740
And the Popeye's new chicken sandwich that I hear is really awesome.

52
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:50,740
I'm taking you both to Oakland and we are going to go to this hole in the wall called

53
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:55,540
OB town that has the best Korean fried chicken you will ever put in your mouth.

54
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:58,700
I am super excited for some KFC.

55
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:00,580
Korean fried chicken.

56
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:01,580
Real KFC.

57
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:03,100
It's a real KFC.

58
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:04,100
All right.

59
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:06,700
Dark Soccer, why are you joining us remote tonight?

60
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:10,220
I know we usually love to tape in the same room, but I heard you had a little accident.

61
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:11,320
Are you okay?

62
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,820
My face is broken.

63
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:13,820
Well-

64
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:15,220
Okay, so-

65
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:18,980
I said something out of the ordinary.

66
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:25,060
Yeah, so I fainted two days ago.

67
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:26,060
Okay, that's scary.

68
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:27,540
I'm a dick for making jokes.

69
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,540
I'm sorry to hear that.

70
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:34,740
Yeah, so basically I was standing, I had gotten up to go pee and then I went back to get that

71
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:39,860
free standing minute on my Apple Watch and I got a little dizzy.

72
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:45,140
Next thing I know, three minutes have passed, I'm on the ground and my face hurts.

73
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:51,060
I apparently fell and hit my face hard on my bedside table.

74
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:56,620
So I busted my lip, have some bone bruises on my chin and my cheekbone.

75
00:03:56,620 --> 00:04:02,940
Thankfully, no concussion or if it was a concussion, it was really minor.

76
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:08,780
So I've been raging headaches for the past couple of days and so I was just like, I've

77
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:14,020
got a bad headache and I'd rather be at home than be driving a longer distance when my

78
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:15,420
head feels like this, so.

79
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:17,140
Yeah, no, totally understandable.

80
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:21,180
So we love to record in the same room and it's part of what makes our podcast special,

81
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:26,380
but sometimes things are going to happen and if you had a thing where you fell and hurt

82
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:32,220
your head, which by the way also happened to me, but it was maybe like four years ago,

83
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:33,420
I had a similar thing.

84
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:37,020
I think I was super dehydrated and I was in a very steamy room.

85
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:41,420
I was basically in the shower kind of enclosed and the fan in there is terrible and I fainted.

86
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:45,420
It was just like a thing out of the blue and I actually ended up chipping my front

87
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:46,420
tooth.

88
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:49,220
It was one of those things where I had to go to the dentist ASAP because I was freaking

89
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:50,220
out.

90
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:51,740
I was like, oh my God, my tooth is all chipped.

91
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:58,420
So thankfully, dentists know how to work miracles and I look fine now, but it's scary.

92
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:05,940
What happened too is I went and I did go to urgent care to get tested, make sure that

93
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:14,740
everything was okay and it was a combination of dehydration and possibly anemia.

94
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:17,560
So I'm drinking Pedialyte.

95
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:23,860
It's disgusting, but I'm drinking it and just taking care of myself.

96
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:27,700
Well what an interesting segue because one of the first things I want to talk about here

97
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:30,660
at the top of the show is the Dragon Con hype.

98
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:35,300
So it's funny you bring up Pedialyte because that's a great way to stop a hangover and

99
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:40,140
there's going to be, well it is important to stay hydrated at Dragon Con and the reality

100
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:45,540
is there's a lot of, because it's in enclosed hotels throughout the Atlanta area, there's

101
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:47,460
a lot of alcohol consumption.

102
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:51,660
People are just openly, because you can open carry because it's indoors.

103
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:54,860
Usually you can't just open carry alcohol out on the street, but this convention is

104
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:55,940
now on the street.

105
00:05:55,940 --> 00:06:01,260
So I think that's why it has a reputation for being such a, lots of libations and so

106
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:02,260
forth.

107
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:06,660
I mean, I'm not making it sound like it's a drunk party and if you're choosing to be

108
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:08,540
sober or what have you, you can't have fun.

109
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:09,540
I don't think that's true.

110
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:12,940
I think you can still, actually there was, I think it was last year, it was probably

111
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:16,940
just last year because there were so many panels that I was doing last year.

112
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:21,060
I didn't really want to drink because I had to get up early to do a bunch of panels.

113
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:26,380
So yeah, I didn't really indulge and I still had a great Dragon Con.

114
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:31,020
So yeah, Mr. Smoosh is making his presence known here.

115
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:33,660
If he keeps acting up off to put them in the other room.

116
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:37,420
Don't you, don't you know, we're trying, I know we're usually here on Sunday, but don't

117
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:38,420
you know, we're trying to do a show.

118
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:41,420
If you're going to yell, at least come over here and do it.

119
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:47,800
I think, I think he smells the KFC that was in here earlier anyway.

120
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:51,500
So I do want to say a big hello to anybody that may have discovered this show, thanks

121
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:52,500
to Dragon Con.

122
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:57,940
Cause I know I'm going to be selling the crap out of this show and other stuff that I work

123
00:06:57,940 --> 00:07:00,920
on from several panels that I'm doing at Dragon Con.

124
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:04,720
So hello, hello to any new listeners and folks that may have discovered this show through

125
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,820
the convention.

126
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:09,400
It's going to be a little, little different tonight just because we did tape prior.

127
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:14,120
Usually we do tape live with folks in chat along with our show, we're able to do the

128
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,320
interaction and all that stuff.

129
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:17,100
We love doing this live.

130
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:21,880
But we wanted to record this week because if we don't record, then we'll miss two weeks

131
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:23,880
in a row and that's a long time to be gone.

132
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:26,760
So it's one thing to miss a Labor Day, but we didn't want to miss two weeks in a row

133
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:29,520
because I'm leaving really early this year because I'm going to be seeing a buddy of

134
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:34,080
mine in North Carolina and then making the six hour drive between the two.

135
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:38,760
But it's like, it's not like the six hour drive from here to LA where it's just like

136
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:43,560
cows and like dead grass the whole way.

137
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:47,200
Like I think the drive I'm going to be experiencing will be a lot better looking, at least that's

138
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,200
my hope.

139
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,200
That's my hope.

140
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,200
We'll see.

141
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,720
Well, Darsaka, you're from the South.

142
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:55,000
Like is it going to be a better road trip in that area you think?

143
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,240
It's going to be tall pine trees the entire way.

144
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,240
I like pine trees.

145
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,240
Okay.

146
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,240
Pine trees are nice.

147
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:07,960
It'll be very, very pretty at the start and then that'll be all you see.

148
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:11,320
Well the nice thing is- At least that's what it's like in Alabama.

149
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:13,920
The nice thing is I get to cross more states off my list.

150
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:17,760
I won't be going to Alabama, but I get to cross off North Carolina, never been there.

151
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:20,600
And then we drive through South Carolina on our way to Georgia.

152
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:24,000
So I'll get to cross off the, obviously I've been to Georgia a million times, thanks to

153
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,620
Dragon Con, but I'll get to cross off the other two Carolinas.

154
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:29,980
So that'll be good.

155
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:35,980
And then next year I have Florida that I get to cross off the list because of the crews

156
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:40,160
are going on in March with the kids from Starboard Power Couplings, that'll be fun.

157
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:42,920
So anyway, enough about my life.

158
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:45,260
Let's talk about video games and all that good stuff.

159
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:48,580
We're going to start off tonight with how is your gaming week and talk about the types

160
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:51,740
of video games that we have been playing this week.

161
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:53,020
Darsaka, how was your gaming week?

162
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:57,460
What have you- I know you had the fall, so maybe not much, but anything to help pass

163
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:58,500
the time maybe?

164
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:04,140
Sims, Animal Crossing on the phone, the usual.

165
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:05,140
More Sims, huh?

166
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:06,580
How's your family progressing?

167
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:08,620
Have you killed anyone yet?

168
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:10,660
I'm actually not playing really any of my families.

169
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:15,020
I only played like one group long enough for them to have a kid because they should have

170
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:16,020
a kid.

171
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:22,700
Because I mean, that's just, it was like an old RP character that I made a Sim for.

172
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:29,780
And then right now I'm remodeling all of the in-game Sims.

173
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:32,660
So that's really it.

174
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:35,820
The Goths right now are on the chopping block.

175
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:39,060
How many mods do you use with the Sims?

176
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:42,540
I'll tell you right now, and I'm actually going to be adding some more.

177
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:47,580
So if I go into my mods folder, because I am actually at my home computer right now.

178
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:48,580
That's Elder Scrolls.

179
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:49,580
Oops.

180
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:56,740
I'm actually, I'm going to probably be waiting, by the way, to do Final Fantasy XIV until

181
00:09:56,740 --> 00:10:02,220
after we split our bills next month, Dan and I are going to be doing that.

182
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:06,460
So right now I have 17,639 installed and I'm going to be adding a few more.

183
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:10,780
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, you have 17,000 mods for the Sims?

184
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:15,980
Well, right, because keep in mind, custom content is all considered a mod.

185
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:17,660
I think they're talking about like each individual piece.

186
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:20,940
Oh, so like if it's one shirt, that's a mod.

187
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:21,940
Exactly.

188
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:22,940
Oh, okay.

189
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:25,340
I mean, there are actual game mods.

190
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:26,340
Okay.

191
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:34,500
And like, I'm about to install four mods, like actual game mods, but those are scripts

192
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:39,080
and scripts go into like their own, like it's hard for me to track actually what scripts

193
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:46,260
I have on there just because, you know, they, goodness, I found some mods in the wrong folder,

194
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:51,020
but they go in like a different folder and I haven't been through that one to see exactly

195
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:56,260
how many I have, but I know like I have the, you know, the no mosaic, you know, so I can

196
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:57,260
have naked Sims.

197
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:58,260
Okay.

198
00:10:58,260 --> 00:10:59,260
Yeah.

199
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:03,340
I was going to say, that's the only mod I need is the, the get rid of the blurs.

200
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:05,940
Isn't the one that makes them do nastier things too.

201
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:06,940
I'm almost positive.

202
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:10,260
I've seen a mod where like they do nastier things.

203
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:11,260
Possibly.

204
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:17,740
I mean, there's, there's like animation mods for the earlier ones.

205
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:18,740
Okay.

206
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:23,140
And I read an art article on Kotaku earlier this week that showed somebody with a large

207
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:24,140
dildo head.

208
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:25,740
So apparently there are mods out there like that.

209
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:26,740
Oh, I'm sure.

210
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:27,740
Of course there are.

211
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:28,740
Yeah.

212
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:29,740
If you can achieve it,

213
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:38,020
but I mean like you can get scripting mods and what those are, you know, once your, your

214
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:42,360
game is patched and everything's running fine, you know, there's only like a few things you

215
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,360
need to do.

216
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:49,420
And, and the company like EA Maxis, they're all like, they're super, like they know exactly

217
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:50,420
what to do.

218
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:55,060
You know, so they're perfectly fine with all of this running, you know, they just aren't

219
00:11:55,060 --> 00:12:01,300
responsible for, you know, any of the shenanigans.

220
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:05,220
Any mod that tries to take your credit card number, shows your children something offensive.

221
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:09,860
It's like you install that you take the responsibility for that, but surely a company like EA has

222
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:17,020
to know, like modding is part of the reason why some of their games continue to succeed

223
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:24,100
for all this time afterwards, you know, because...

224
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:25,100
Go ahead.

225
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:26,100
I'm sorry.

226
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:28,220
One of the mods that I actually, it's a family of mods.

227
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:32,020
It's called don't wash dishes where you angry poop.

228
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:33,900
What?

229
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:41,780
Because you can, you can wash dishes in any sink and there's a habit where like your,

230
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:50,260
if your sim is closer to like a, a bathroom sink, then they'll try to wash dishes in that

231
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:51,260
sink.

232
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:54,380
Oh, I thought it was the other way around.

233
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:57,700
And there's also a don't prepare food where you angry poop.

234
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:59,780
I that's what mods called.

235
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:04,620
I thought you were about to say that if they couldn't find the toilet, they would just

236
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:07,500
poop in the sink.

237
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:11,020
And I was like, that's disturbing.

238
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:15,300
Like how drunk was your sim?

239
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:23,180
They make outdoor toilets though, that those outdoor toilets count as a bathroom, but you

240
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:24,780
can place them outside just in nature.

241
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:27,300
They're basically a giant plant.

242
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:28,300
All right.

243
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:32,700
Can you build like in this, I haven't played the Sims really since the first game, but

244
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:37,700
can you, can you build like outdoor homes, like, like tree houses now with porta potties

245
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:38,700
and stuff?

246
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:39,700
Yeah.

247
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:40,700
You always could do that.

248
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:47,820
Um, like, um, you know, there's some of the month or not mods, but some of the things

249
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:55,900
that I'll run are, um, like you can hit like, uh, control and the close bracket and it makes

250
00:13:55,940 --> 00:14:02,780
things bigger and control, uh, open bracket is to make things smaller.

251
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:03,780
This is on a PC.

252
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:06,780
Um, cause my Mac doesn't have a big enough hard drive.

253
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:13,060
Um, but you can make things like huge or small.

254
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:17,020
And then, you know, there's another, uh, where you can, cause normally it doesn't let you

255
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:21,740
put things in certain places, but you can tell certain textures to not textures, but

256
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:25,260
certain objects to overlap.

257
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:32,060
And then you can, you know, make like, like plants growing out of your wall and like weird

258
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:33,060
stuff.

259
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:36,540
I guess that's a way you might decorate your house if you, you know, uh, have a lot of

260
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:37,540
money.

261
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:43,260
Uh, but I was going to say about the whole, I was going to say about the whole, um, modding

262
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:44,260
thing.

263
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:47,800
Like I'm trying to think like the, the one Sims game I don't think did very well was

264
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:48,800
the Sims online.

265
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,700
Remember when they tried to do the Sims online?

266
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:54,260
That one didn't do very well, but probably because you couldn't really mod that one because

267
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:55,260
it was always online.

268
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:56,260
Is that the Facebook one?

269
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:57,260
Yeah, no, no.

270
00:14:57,260 --> 00:15:02,020
There was like, it was them trying to get on the MMO craze.

271
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:06,700
Like when everything started breaking through like world of Warcraft and, and, uh, uh, EverQuest

272
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:10,460
and all that stuff, they tried to do their own like MMO and it seemed, you know, it did

273
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:13,940
seem like a natural progression is that you could build, you know, your own Sims house

274
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:15,220
with other people.

275
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:19,940
But apparently the whole thing turned into, I feel like in the early days of OLR, we talked

276
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:20,940
about this.

277
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:21,940
That's pretty sure.

278
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:31,220
But like it just turned into a cesspool of like prostitution, drugs, like everything

279
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:33,780
that humanity, lawless humanity would turn into.

280
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:35,260
They built Second Life again.

281
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:36,260
Yeah, pretty much.

282
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:37,900
They built Second Life in the Sims online.

283
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:40,180
And that's why I think they third life.

284
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:41,180
Third life.

285
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:42,180
All right.

286
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:45,660
Darsaga, anything else for your game of the week?

287
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:46,660
Nah.

288
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:47,660
All right.

289
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:49,140
Then we'll move on to Loki.

290
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:51,380
Hey, we can hear you typing by the way.

291
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:52,820
So careful.

292
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:54,100
Uh, Loki, how was your TV week?

293
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:57,260
I didn't play a thing.

294
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:58,260
That's right.

295
00:15:58,260 --> 00:15:59,260
Wow.

296
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:00,420
You've been really great with your track record.

297
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:04,020
I've been playing no games on this gaming podcast.

298
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:10,500
No, I have been working on coding and prepping for this coming week, which okay.

299
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:14,980
It's at least it's like adjacent, you know, you got to code a game to play a game, I guess.

300
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:20,740
So yeah, so I've been just working on getting stuff ready because I am going to participate

301
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:22,180
in a game jam next week.

302
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:23,180
Oh, wow.

303
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:24,180
Yes.

304
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:29,380
So I've been getting ready, um, to do that and I'm hoping to stream a lot of it too.

305
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:30,380
So we'll see.

306
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:31,380
What's the game jam is.

307
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:32,380
Oh, it's something you do at your house.

308
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:35,180
You're not going to go to a, uh, no, not going anywhere.

309
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:36,180
It's for a week.

310
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:40,180
And so I have to work in the middle of that as well.

311
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:43,540
Um, but it's basically, it's a community game jam.

312
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:47,300
Um, it's a bunch of different YouTubers that are doing, putting it on.

313
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:52,580
So like some of the other ones I watch for like unity stuff like Braxis or Braxie.

314
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:54,660
And I don't remember the other guys putting it on here.

315
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:57,020
So let me just pull this up here real fast.

316
00:16:57,020 --> 00:17:00,360
Um, but it's looks like it's pretty cool.

317
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:05,460
It's kind of laid back as far as you know what my expectations of it are going to be.

318
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:08,340
It's not like lunar dare or something like that.

319
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:09,980
Uh, okay.

320
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:11,660
So yeah, community game jam.

321
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:18,660
It's uh, it's IO, um, uh, slash jam slash, uh, C G J.

322
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:26,300
And it starts on Saturday at noon and it goes until August 31st at noon.

323
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:30,220
And yeah, so they have, it'd be a good way to spend the downtime with a week, week off

324
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:31,220
OLR.

325
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:32,220
Yeah, exactly.

326
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:36,160
So it'll be interesting to see, you know, what they're gonna, um, what the theme's going

327
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,160
to be.

328
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,740
You're going to let us play whatever you make.

329
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:39,740
Yeah.

330
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:45,820
I'm going to, I'm going to release something like, like, um, like they have on shop, you

331
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:47,460
know, put damn food on the plate.

332
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:49,100
You got to serve them something.

333
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:50,100
I like it.

334
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:51,100
Yes.

335
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:52,100
Put the, put the food on the plate.

336
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:53,100
Yeah.

337
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:57,260
So yeah, it's being put on by a, it's organized by a Blackthorn prod, Braxis, uh, Danny and

338
00:17:57,260 --> 00:18:02,960
Jerry, uh, Jerry's sky, Lou and, uh, some other folks.

339
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:06,820
So it's a bunch of, it's like a big community of people that do like game development videos

340
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:07,820
on YouTube.

341
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:09,500
Is this something we can put on VoG network?

342
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:12,980
Like some of the, you remember we had that game jam a long time ago and some of those

343
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:13,980
was, they're still there.

344
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:16,740
It's some of those winning games or, well, they all won, but the VoG network, we had

345
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:18,340
some of the games that are playable.

346
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:21,340
Um, is it something that you can put there or maybe, I don't know.

347
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:22,340
I, uh, yes.

348
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:24,820
I mean, those games are there.

349
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:27,980
You have to talk to Bobby about the technical stuff, but yeah, I mean, I think it's going

350
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:33,180
to be hosted probably on itch.io, but it should be playable there.

351
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:35,660
I mean, we can make it available, I'm sure.

352
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:41,540
So I'm hoping that I can do it all right, but if not, you can watch me fail for a very

353
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:42,540
long time.

354
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:44,900
So we've been doing that for 17 years.

355
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:45,900
Yes, exactly.

356
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:46,900
So even more.

357
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:47,900
All right.

358
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:50,500
No, we're learning opportunity.

359
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:51,500
That's right.

360
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:52,500
It's a learning opportunity.

361
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:53,500
We're rooting for you.

362
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:54,500
This is good.

363
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:55,860
This would be a good thing for your kids to see you do when they're getting into pro or

364
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:57,460
at least Josh is getting into programming.

365
00:18:57,460 --> 00:18:58,460
Yeah, that's cool.

366
00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:02,380
I may take a couple of days off during the week, but you know, you earned more time.

367
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:03,380
You deserve it.

368
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:04,380
All right.

369
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:05,580
My gaming week.

370
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:09,260
So, um, I've kind of played a lot, I mean, we're, we're an abbreviated week this week

371
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:12,860
because we're recording a little earlier, but, um, I have still been continuing to play

372
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:15,300
Final Fantasy 14, doing some of the end game stuff.

373
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:17,980
Uh, Shane made me do some of the new raids.

374
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:20,820
So I actually played like w w we live streamed everything.

375
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:24,020
I've been trying to be really good about doing more live streaming on my personal channel

376
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:25,120
at Rob Roberts.

377
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:29,100
So, um, I played some Final Fantasy 14 with Shane the other night and probably the other

378
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:32,340
game I played, that's a little newer, at least new to me.

379
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:36,420
I played No Man's Sky on PC because remember I bought the PC version.

380
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:37,420
I bought it.

381
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:39,660
I haven't installed it yet, but I did buy it.

382
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:43,140
You double dipped, Bobby Blackwolf double dipped, like everybody's double dipping on

383
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:44,140
No Man's Sky now.

384
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:45,140
It's great.

385
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:46,140
Because mods.

386
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:47,140
Not yet.

387
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:52,160
Nope, it's not going to happen because it's easier for me to play on my computer than

388
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,380
with a controller.

389
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:55,380
That's yeah.

390
00:19:55,380 --> 00:20:00,420
I, I kind of just wish I'd bought it on PC the first time, but I mean, it was a couple

391
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:01,420
of years.

392
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:02,820
It was originally a PlayStation four game.

393
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:05,300
So I mean, that wasn't exactly possible.

394
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:09,260
So, but like obviously with PC, I can play in 2k mode.

395
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:14,920
I have to really dumb down the graphics, especially if I'm streaming, but like it's, it's doable,

396
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:15,920
you know?

397
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,260
So that's, that's pretty cool.

398
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:18,260
All right.

399
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:20,240
And Mr. Smoosh is getting up on the soundboard.

400
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,240
That's a big no-no.

401
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:28,300
Loki buy me time or somebody that cat, I swear to God, it just is causing all sorts of trouble.

402
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:30,300
All because I didn't share the chicken with you.

403
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:31,300
Too bad.

404
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:32,300
I don't know.

405
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:33,300
Who does he think he is?

406
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:37,940
I finally heard back from discord by the way.

407
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:39,740
Gonna change all the switches and all that stuff.

408
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:42,020
Oh, cause you got locked out of your other account, right?

409
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:43,020
Yeah.

410
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:44,980
So I have to delete my account and remake it.

411
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:46,260
Ah, what a pain.

412
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:47,260
All right.

413
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:49,180
Well, you're still with us at least here tonight.

414
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:51,700
So no man's sky, no man's sky on PC.

415
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:52,700
It's it's prettier.

416
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:56,580
Um, although obviously I have to like, especially if I'm streaming, I have to turn the graphics

417
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:59,380
way down or else like my computer's just like help.

418
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:03,540
Um, but when I'm not streaming, like it's, it's very lovely to look at.

419
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:06,940
Uh, the first planet I started on was some ice planet.

420
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:11,620
Like it was really, it was a really horrible place, but what I did, I rolled straight into

421
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:13,400
Alan's universe.

422
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:18,980
So like I joined his game, so it's put me on a planet in the system he was already in.

423
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:23,500
So I started there and we kind of noticed, and I think Bobby was there cause I was streaming

424
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:26,700
it live and he talked about how some of it is kind of scripted in the beginning.

425
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:30,900
Like you always, you know, at a certain time get like a severe storm that comes through

426
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:34,020
because it's teaching you how to replenish your life supply, you know, and there's certain

427
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:36,900
things that are like scripted to happen at the beginning, no matter what planet you're

428
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:37,900
on.

429
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:38,900
So it's kind of interesting to see.

430
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:42,420
Cause like, uh, when Alan came to the planet, he's like, I don't see this stuff because

431
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:45,260
you're being scripted through all this stuff right now.

432
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:46,820
Ah, so yeah.

433
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:48,820
So I guess maybe Alan was saying a lot of that.

434
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:54,900
But then eventually I made my way to the moon of that planet, which was lovely.

435
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:58,500
It was like one of those like purple grass planets and very serene.

436
00:21:58,500 --> 00:21:59,620
It was very nice.

437
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:01,600
And that's where Alan's base is.

438
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:06,560
So I started a base, like I couldn't build right near his, but I was able to build like

439
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:08,400
on the other side of the mountain from it.

440
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:11,540
So now we have bases right near each other, but it won't let me upload it cause it says

441
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:12,860
it's too small.

442
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:16,780
So I have to expand it a little more still and then I should be able to upload it and

443
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:19,100
more people I guess could visit it if they wanted to.

444
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:23,220
But sadly I probably won't get a lot more time with No Man's Sky until after I'm back

445
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:24,220
for my trip.

446
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:27,340
But, uh, I was, you know, enjoying the experience on, on PC.

447
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:30,260
It's just getting used to the different controls was the hardest part.

448
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:35,620
Cause it's like all these keys like Q, W, E, R, you know, they're all mapped to different

449
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:36,620
things.

450
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:38,980
And so like, I'm not, Oh, I'm just going to play the controller.

451
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:42,140
So that'll, my brain wasn't used to, yeah, I guess I could just plug in my Xbox controller

452
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:43,700
or your PlayStation four controller.

453
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:44,700
I guess that's true.

454
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:45,700
I should just play with the controller.

455
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:48,100
That would make it a lot easier, but that's, that's okay.

456
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:51,780
I don't, you know, there is something about using the mouse to aim that I enjoy and all

457
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:52,780
that stuff.

458
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:53,780
So that is, that is nice.

459
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:57,060
So, um, yeah, that's pretty much been my gaming week.

460
00:22:57,060 --> 00:22:58,340
I don't think a lot else to share.

461
00:22:58,340 --> 00:23:01,060
Cause I talked about VR on No Man's Sky last week.

462
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:02,060
I'm pretty sure.

463
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:04,220
So I don't need to cover that again.

464
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:09,260
So, uh, we will move on with the program and in our next segment, we're gonna do something

465
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:11,940
a little special, a little different here tonight.

466
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:15,660
Something we, um, don't usually have as a segment in the show, but maybe we ought to

467
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:19,500
bring it back because we got a lot of great feedback this week.

468
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:23,140
Uh, what we wanted to invite with some of your questions and some of your discussion

469
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:25,580
drivers this week on Twitter.

470
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:29,940
So over at our Twitter account, uh, OLR, we asked a question this week.

471
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:32,840
We asked everybody to, uh, uh, answer the following.

472
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:38,380
We said on a special recorded OLR this week, we want to invite your questions for our hosts

473
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:42,780
on gaming, on podcasting or anything reasonable you might have.

474
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:45,960
So we got quite a few responses.

475
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:48,540
So we have a few questions and discussion topics for tonight.

476
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:49,540
So y'all ready?

477
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:52,620
You're ready for Ask Orange Lounge via Twitter?

478
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:53,620
Yes.

479
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:55,700
All right, let's do it.

480
00:23:55,700 --> 00:24:00,060
Uh, first off tonight, our pal Flaco Jones.

481
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:01,060
Flaco Jones.

482
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:03,420
So I've seen, been doing a lot of streaming very late at night.

483
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:07,320
Uh, last, the other night he was playing some Paladins, I think, but hopefully that's all

484
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,560
going well for him.

485
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:14,260
So Flaco Jones starts us off saying, I know Loki was having Joy-Con drift.

486
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:20,220
Has he or any of the other hosts taken advantage of Nintendo's free repair for the issue?

487
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:25,960
I sent mine in and they took care of them quickly and at no charge plus free shipping.

488
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:28,720
So I haven't took advantage of the whole, I haven't yet.

489
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:35,240
Um, and I want to, I just haven't done it yet, but I need to do both sets, both Joy-Cons,

490
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:37,280
but I'll have to do one at a time.

491
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:39,860
And it's one of those things where they're going to be missing for a while while they're

492
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:40,860
getting repaired.

493
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:41,860
That's why I have two sets.

494
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:46,660
So like, so I would do one, have it repaired, it comes back and then do the second one.

495
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:50,500
But that's less bad because I only have the one set, but I was gonna say, I'm not having

496
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:55,500
the problems you guys are having, but admittedly mine gets less traffic.

497
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:59,500
I don't have the kid factor either, which I'm sure, you know, they tend to, you know,

498
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:01,700
put a little more wear and tear on them.

499
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:06,620
Um, and uh, yeah, so they haven't really been an issue for me yet, but I'm glad Nintendo

500
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:08,760
kind of, kind of came around on the program.

501
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:11,560
I, well, I think they were kind of forced to, or else they were going to be looking

502
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:13,200
at a class action lawsuit type of thing.

503
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:17,800
So I think they were kind of putting a quarter on that, having to do the warranty thing.

504
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:21,760
Uh, Dark Sakura, you, you haven't had a problem with your Switch at all, right?

505
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:24,200
So you're, you probably haven't taken advantage of this either, right?

506
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,880
Honestly, it's our Pro Controller that had more problems.

507
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,400
It's got some input lag in it.

508
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,240
I think just our model.

509
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,240
Interesting.

510
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:36,600
So the Pro Controller having issues, but they, it's not, it's just input lag.

511
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:41,580
And it had a little bit of drift on it too, but I haven't seen anything going on for

512
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:42,580
the Pro Controller.

513
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:44,260
So we have nothing to take advantage of.

514
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:45,260
Yeah, I know.

515
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:47,380
I was gonna say, I don't think that's part of the program yet.

516
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:50,460
Who knows if there's enough of those problems out there, who knows what'll happen?

517
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:53,140
Well, Dark Sakura, I bet this next question will be up your alley.

518
00:25:53,140 --> 00:26:00,660
So our next tweet tonight is from Rettertainment who says, I have a Sega Saturn and one game

519
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:02,340
missed.

520
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:04,900
I've been thinking of getting another game.

521
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:07,900
What should I keep my eye out for?

522
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:09,840
What shouldn't you keep your eye out for?

523
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:11,920
Is it a US?

524
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:14,160
It's a US one, right?

525
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:17,880
It was not specified, so we're going to assume a US one.

526
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:18,880
Okay.

527
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:26,080
So US games, of course there's, if you're into fighting games, any of the Street Fighter,

528
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:30,040
King of Fighters, you know, those are all, well, actually the King of Fighters games

529
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:32,080
require the RAM cartridge.

530
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:41,100
So I would say, basically like Street Fighter Alpha 2, the first Street Fighter Alpha, if

531
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:48,180
you can get any of like the Sega Aegis stuff, those are pretty good.

532
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:49,660
There weren't too many of them that came out in the US.

533
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:56,440
Of course you want to have Knights, you want to have, gosh, I'm trying to think what else

534
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:58,860
is like, I'd have to go look at the vault now.

535
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:01,640
The Panzer Dragoon Zwee?

536
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:09,520
Panzer Dragoon Saga, actually it's expensive, but absolutely worth it.

537
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:13,120
We got ours like really cheap too, but yeah, the Panzer Dragoon games are worth it.

538
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:17,240
I mean, they're not like my absolute favorites, but they're good games.

539
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:21,480
Is the Sega Saturn hard to mod to play import games?

540
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:25,720
If you want to ask, you will have to ask your husband about that because I've never done

541
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:26,720
it.

542
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:27,720
Oh really?

543
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:34,220
I didn't even know Alan modded Sega Saturns, what?

544
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:38,020
I think we had his modded Sega Saturn for like a hot minute.

545
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:42,020
Honestly, it doesn't surprise me though, Alan was a Sega guy for a long time, so it doesn't

546
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:44,860
like surprise me, but it's just kind of funny.

547
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:51,500
I would have thought that you and Dan would have had the lock on that.

548
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:56,860
We had converter cartridges, so that's what we did.

549
00:27:56,860 --> 00:27:57,860
Gotcha.

550
00:27:57,860 --> 00:28:02,200
No, and the Saturn was one of those platforms I kind of missed out on, like I didn't catch

551
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:06,360
up with Sega really until like the Dreamcast, so all my Sega memories are with that, so

552
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:09,700
I don't have a lot to recommend.

553
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:12,320
I would have said the big stuff like Knights as well.

554
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:17,560
Well, like how you see, this was back in the days when I used to rent consoles from Blockbuster

555
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:22,220
because I didn't buy a Sega Saturn until much later, but I used to rent it with a stall.

556
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:25,400
That was another one of the games I liked in Clockwork Knight.

557
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:28,260
A stall was pretty good, but awfully slow.

558
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:30,500
Yeah, but it's pretty.

559
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:32,780
It had great music.

560
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:38,460
I find that interesting that of all the games in the world for the Sega Saturn, Retertainment

561
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:43,420
has missed, but I'm going to assume maybe it was like included or like a really good

562
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:46,980
deal because he doesn't say where the Sega Saturn came from, like if it was given to

563
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:50,660
him or if he found out like a flea market garage sale type of thing or what.

564
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:56,160
Yeah, so it's just interesting that of all the games, I mean, I'm not knocking missed.

565
00:28:56,160 --> 00:29:00,160
Missed isn't a bad game, but I don't associate missed with the Saturn nearly as much as I

566
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:06,920
do like old MS-DOS PC because like that, you know, I feel like missed was only ported to

567
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:12,440
like the Saturn and all those consoles because of how it was performing on the PC, you know?

568
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:13,440
Yeah.

569
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:14,440
Anyway.

570
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:15,720
All right, let's move on.

571
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:18,160
Now we're getting into some deeper questions too.

572
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:19,160
This is good.

573
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:25,860
So Elliot Bentley, Elliot underscore Bentley sent us a tweet saying, what games have changed

574
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:28,340
the way you think of a certain genre?

575
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:30,680
It's a really good question.

576
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:34,140
What games have changed the way you think of a certain genre?

577
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:37,540
And even though I know we're not live tonight, I'm going to look through chat when this is

578
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:38,540
all done.

579
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:41,140
So I would be very curious because this is one I could see a lot of different answers

580
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:42,140
for.

581
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:45,340
Maybe we'll go back and read some of your answers next week, but anyway, or in two weeks

582
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:46,340
when we come back.

583
00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:47,340
But here's an example.

584
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,640
B continues his tweet here.

585
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:51,000
Here's an example.

586
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:57,360
Since playing Breath of the Wild, I'm hyper aware of the way many open world games rely

587
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:04,360
on maps filled with icons and arrows pointing directly to your next destination.

588
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:07,720
So what games have changed the way you think of a certain genre?

589
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:12,160
So he's basically saying that like, because of the Breath of the Wild, like, oh, it made

590
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:15,880
me realize like all these open world games kind of have some of these like kind of base

591
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:18,220
elements that are very similar.

592
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:21,260
So what game changed the way you think of a certain genre?

593
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:22,980
None really.

594
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:28,220
I mean, I've always, I don't really look at games per genre really.

595
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:33,100
I look at every game to me is a different and unique experience.

596
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:37,300
So I wouldn't say that anything's changed the way I think about it because I go into

597
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:39,860
every game as their own experience.

598
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:41,860
That's just how I am.

599
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:42,860
That's fair.

600
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:47,200
Okay, so like an answer that comes to my mind is a game that we've stand forever on Orange

601
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:51,600
Ons Radio, which I bet a lot of you guys maybe haven't played yet, but you need to go find

602
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:55,220
a way to play this game, even if illegally, like I'm just going to be real, find the ROM

603
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:56,220
and download it.

604
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:59,880
Because if we've been robbed of this game for all these years, like they just they're

605
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:01,920
never going to put it out for you to get legally.

606
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:03,760
So you should just get it illegally at this point.

607
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:04,760
Sorry, not sorry.

608
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:09,420
And that is the Guardian Legend because my answer is like the Guardian Legend because

609
00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:16,000
of the way it fused, like shooter and like overworld action, like the Zelda kind of element,

610
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:21,200
like I would say like the Guardian Legend really made me rethink the shooter genre,

611
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:26,880
because it was like it added this much deeper layer to it, where that the adventuring that

612
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:33,260
you were doing around the world was affecting, you know, what you did in the shooting part,

613
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:37,040
you know, and like it was it was a different type of shooter to like, I like the way the

614
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:39,260
two sides influenced each other.

615
00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:43,320
And I think those type of mishmash genre games are going to always be the ones that come

616
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:47,600
to mind because you know, another one from back in the day, you ready for another obscure

617
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,240
NES title?

618
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:51,600
This was another genre fusing game.

619
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:58,040
And it fused again, like your Zelda type of overworld with a more traditional RPG.

620
00:31:58,040 --> 00:31:59,680
And that is Magic of Scheherazade.

621
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:03,800
I don't know if you've ever played, have you ever played Magic of Scheherazade?

622
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:05,160
Like briefly?

623
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:06,160
Yeah.

624
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:11,020
You know, some of it, it's a little clunky in parts, because I think it's very ambitious

625
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:13,040
what they were trying to do with that game.

626
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:18,460
And I think that game in some ways makes you rethink RPGs.

627
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:19,940
I don't know, I could probably come up with more.

628
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:22,740
I don't know if you guys have anything to add to this.

629
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:28,160
Grant the thought of five and the amount of detail that developers can put into a game,

630
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:32,760
like the ridiculous amount of details that they have in there, like with pant legs getting

631
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:38,600
wet up to this point where they get into the water or like just all sorts of weird stuff,

632
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:45,140
flip flops flopping and just the animals and there's all sorts of like crazy details that

633
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:46,140
are in that.

634
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:52,260
So kind of like environmental, the environmental impact, not like climate change type of discussion,

635
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:58,740
but more like the environment, you know, physics and awareness with an action game, which is

636
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:03,040
interesting because you could also think like crackdown where you kind of take traditional

637
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:05,040
physics and kind of turn it on its head a little bit.

638
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:06,040
Yeah.

639
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:07,040
Way.

640
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:10,020
I think crackdown is kind of a genre bending game a little bit, a little bit because it

641
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:14,560
took the grand theft auto-esque type overworld mechanic, but made it like, but what if you

642
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:17,280
had anti-gravity boots type of things?

643
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:21,300
What if, you know, you could do all these different things or you could take the open

644
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:26,040
world grand theft auto type genre and what they did with like driver three and how your

645
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:27,400
game is so fucking buggy.

646
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:30,260
It just ignores a lot of the rules.

647
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:33,340
I love driver three because it was so terrible.

648
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:34,340
It was fun.

649
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:38,580
Are there other games maybe in that category, like a game that was so fucking bad, it made

650
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:43,820
you kind of rethink the genre a little bit, but it's like kind of fun in a charming way.

651
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:47,260
So bad spice world and music games.

652
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:49,300
Oh God.

653
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:50,300
That's right.

654
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:51,300
On the PlayStation one.

655
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:55,740
Let's put another girl through her paces spice world on PlayStation.

656
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:59,280
Totally not something that a pimp would say.

657
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:04,680
I was thinking in terms of open world though, going back to that, I mean Minecraft was pretty,

658
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:05,680
pretty crazy.

659
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:06,680
Oh, good call.

660
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:07,760
When it was new.

661
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:08,760
Good call.

662
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:12,920
Like a game that's open world, but it's your world.

663
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:14,160
Yeah.

664
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:18,200
That's definitely genre defined or like genre bending for sure.

665
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:25,540
But I'm not saying that anything really like, it's just that I don't look at the impact

666
00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:26,540
like that.

667
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:27,540
Does that make sense?

668
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:31,060
Yeah, no, that's, that's why I kind of like a question like that because it does make

669
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:32,900
us kind of take a step back and go, huh.

670
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:36,540
I wonder what game has made me kind of like no man's sky.

671
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:40,740
Like how everything is procedural is kind of ridiculous.

672
00:34:40,740 --> 00:34:44,300
That's another, that's another different type of like open worlds type of thing where what

673
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:47,340
if the world is just completely generated.

674
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:50,920
Or borderlands with the billions of guns that they have.

675
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:51,920
You know what though?

676
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:55,840
You know what though would be in a similar bucket with no man's sky would be, um, elder

677
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:59,700
scrolls two.

678
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:03,000
Was that the one that had the procedurally generated, like all the caves and everything?

679
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,320
Like they didn't go in there and design it.

680
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:07,680
Everything was like generated basically because the world was so fricking huge.

681
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:08,680
I think it was two.

682
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:09,720
It was either two or three.

683
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:11,120
I don't think, I don't think it was Morrowind though.

684
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:12,120
I think it was the second game.

685
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:13,120
I think it was, yeah.

686
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:14,120
The first one's arena.

687
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:15,120
The second one's blades.

688
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:16,120
Right.

689
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:17,120
I think it was that one.

690
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:19,900
Anyway, food for thought.

691
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:24,140
Anyway, I'm excited to see chat's answers on that too, and maybe some more tweets on

692
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:25,140
that, but great question.

693
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:26,140
Okay.

694
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:31,820
So our next tweet, as we get to some more listener questions tonight for our show, comes

695
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:36,460
from SSJ100 Matt who says, it's a three, it's a three part question.

696
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:37,460
You ready?

697
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:38,460
So here we go.

698
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:39,460
Part one.

699
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:45,420
Besides wearing pants, what has been the biggest challenge and adjustment you've all had to

700
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:50,400
make now that the show has a video aspect to it?

701
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,400
What's the big...

702
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,400
Wearing pants.

703
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,400
Kidding.

704
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:54,400
I, come on.

705
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:56,880
We all wore pants before because we were all in the same room.

706
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:57,880
Although...

707
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:58,880
Uh-uh.

708
00:35:58,880 --> 00:35:59,880
Sometimes I wore a skirt.

709
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:00,880
I, yeah.

710
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:04,640
Well, and I was going to say, sometimes I'd be lazy and wear gym shorts, you know, and

711
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:07,400
like, I wouldn't bother to do my hair or wear a hat.

712
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:11,300
I just would look like shit because I'm like, well, nobody's going to see me, but Loki and

713
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:12,800
Dark Soccer, and they've known me forever.

714
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,320
They've seen me at my absolute worst.

715
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:15,320
So whatever.

716
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:16,900
Like you do think about that a little bit.

717
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:20,540
I definitely, I do have to think a little bit about like what I'm going to wear.

718
00:36:20,540 --> 00:36:23,880
Like what's going to be like, and even to the point where I'm like, oh, I'm wearing

719
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:28,080
this cruel intention shirt that I got at Target on the stream tonight.

720
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:31,700
And I'm like, um, I think I wore this on the show like three weeks ago and I kind of like

721
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:35,100
didn't want to repeat it, but I was like, at the same time, it's like, you know, like

722
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:38,620
I kind of get into that mode where it's like, oh, I don't necessarily want to repeat outfits

723
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:43,740
either, but like, it's, it's just, you don't buy shirts to wear once and throw them away.

724
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:46,400
Like I, we don't live that kind of lifestyle.

725
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:50,600
It's hard to decide where to look because I have to look at the camera, talk to the

726
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:56,400
audience, look at Rob, it's like, ah, that is huge.

727
00:36:56,400 --> 00:37:00,640
That is the biggest challenge because I remember after the first episode, uh, the first piece

728
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:05,320
of feedback I got from a friend was that like, you guys don't even look at each other when

729
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:06,760
you're doing the show.

730
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:11,480
And I'm like, no, we really don't like, because when it's a radio show, you don't see that.

731
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:13,620
And he's like, you guys are like always buried in your computers.

732
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:17,180
Like, and I'm like, well, we're pulling up the next story and you know, whatever.

733
00:37:17,180 --> 00:37:18,540
He's like, you're on your phone half the time.

734
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:20,820
I'm like, well, I'm multitasking.

735
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:23,300
Well those Pokemon are going to catch themselves.

736
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:27,900
So, you know, so I would say that has been a big change is that we have to be aware,

737
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:34,140
you know, I mean, yeah, we said in the very beginning, we're still doing an audio podcast.

738
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:36,360
It's just the delivery method is different.

739
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:38,740
So we're not going to like turn it upside down for Twitch.

740
00:37:38,740 --> 00:37:40,420
We're not suddenly doing orange launch video.

741
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:45,160
It is still orange launch radio, but certainly I don't want it to like look terrible.

742
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:48,800
So I think, you know, some of that feedback was still very right on is that, okay, I need

743
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:53,080
to not be on my phone unless it's like, you know, unless I'm bringing up tweets to talk

744
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:57,160
about on air or, you know, I need to try to like actually look at Loki or Dark Sakura,

745
00:37:57,160 --> 00:38:01,600
which is here talking or the camera, you know, instead of like looking, you know, or like

746
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:05,280
taking a nap or like, I'm just going to rest my eyes while Loki does the next story.

747
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:07,320
Like, I can't really do that anymore.

748
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:08,320
You know?

749
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:11,060
I think that was a big change.

750
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:13,060
Anything for you, Dark Sakura?

751
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:14,060
No.

752
00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:18,300
But you also, you tend to sit off cam too.

753
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:19,300
Yeah.

754
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:21,700
So it's not really super crazy for me.

755
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:24,900
I'm just doing my, my huge.

756
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:25,900
Yep.

757
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:32,380
Number two, what has been your favorite part about adding video to the show?

758
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:44,600
I couldn't say, I'll be honest, I kind of don't feel one way or another about it.

759
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:45,960
That's fair.

760
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:51,080
It's the, obviously the pre-show things that we have are hilarious.

761
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:53,800
The little bumpers that Jason and I do.

762
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:54,800
Yeah.

763
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:55,800
Yes.

764
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:56,800
Yeah.

765
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:57,800
Those are fun to do.

766
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:58,800
It's a little, little extra thing.

767
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:03,340
I would say, and you know, uh, when it's utilized, it's wonderful.

768
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:07,780
It's not, you know, I don't expect everything on this show is going to get clipped, but

769
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:09,980
I love the clip thing.

770
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:14,420
Like when we do have those random things that happen, we're like, let's say Mr. Smoosh makes

771
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:17,260
an appearance on cam or something and people, you know, want to see that.

772
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:18,620
So the clip happens.

773
00:39:18,620 --> 00:39:22,100
But then the nice thing about the clipping is that then people who let's say they do

774
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:26,860
only listen to the audio podcast, but they heard that this funny thing was happening.

775
00:39:26,860 --> 00:39:28,300
Somebody probably clipped it.

776
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:31,840
And so they can go onto the Twitch channel, you know, even though you have to be a subscriber

777
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:35,240
to see the full video archive, you don't have the clips are free.

778
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:38,620
So when people do clip things, you can just watch those whenever.

779
00:39:38,620 --> 00:39:42,240
So I think for me, that's been my favorite part is the clip.

780
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:47,200
I think that's more of a, a nature of moving to Twitch specifically, cause like, you don't,

781
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:49,680
you can't clip on mixer or YouTube.

782
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:54,600
So then it is maybe video, but that's the best answer I got for your question.

783
00:39:54,600 --> 00:40:00,140
Number three, what video improvements would you like to make or see happen?

784
00:40:00,140 --> 00:40:01,660
More flashy effects.

785
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:05,640
I, I am going to make it a goal that when we come back from dragon con, we're going

786
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:09,860
to have some transitional bumpers because you guys will probably notice like our music

787
00:40:09,860 --> 00:40:11,920
has been missing for a long time, right?

788
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:15,580
Like when we do the classic game of the week, we don't get the little doo doo doo doo doo

789
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:18,700
doo doo doo doo like the DDR Oha stop music that we were using forever.

790
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:23,220
We don't have that anymore, but I actually do want to bring those back with video bumpers.

791
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:27,960
So I'm trying to teach myself a new program to do those types of like animated bumpers

792
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:31,680
and hopefully those will come back soon, but don't hold me to it, but it's a goal for after

793
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:37,120
dragon con and maybe multiple camera angles and only because there was, was it that one

794
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:42,080
Twitch streamer on Twitter that we saw, Oh God, she's so funny.

795
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:43,080
Oh my God.

796
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:44,080
What is her name?

797
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:49,240
I followed her because when she reads these guys, cause trash bags will come into our

798
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:54,800
chat and say that, that kind of dumb shit that, you know, mouth breathers will say to

799
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:58,900
girl streamers and she will drag them through the mud.

800
00:40:58,900 --> 00:40:59,900
It's pretty hilarious.

801
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:01,860
This is her multiple camera angles to do it.

802
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:02,860
Paladin Amber.

803
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:04,220
Shout out to Paladin Amber.

804
00:41:04,220 --> 00:41:05,260
She doesn't need a shout out from us.

805
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:08,980
She's got 354 people watching her stream playing Minecraft right now.

806
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:12,660
She probably doesn't need our help, but I think she is hilarious and it's because of

807
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:18,340
clips that I got to, yeah, so yeah, the multiple camera angle stuff that that'd be great.

808
00:41:18,340 --> 00:41:22,680
For me, like the number one thing I want to do, I want to change the whole layout.

809
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:27,560
Like like we had, we kind of took our old radio layout and just kind of made some small

810
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:29,680
adjustments, make it work for video.

811
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:34,320
There is a very good chance in the next year or so that the studio is going to move again.

812
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:39,120
Alan and I are looking at potentially moving again and next time the next space will be

813
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:42,500
designed with video in mind.

814
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:46,840
And I think that will go a long way in how this show is presented.

815
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:55,300
And someday, someday in the far future, we will have an orange lounge and actually, yes,

816
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:59,140
maybe perhaps, maybe after all that time, I'll get an orange cover for you to cover.

817
00:41:59,140 --> 00:42:00,140
There you go.

818
00:42:00,140 --> 00:42:01,140
You have our fricking orange lounge.

819
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:06,260
Um, I dark soccer, I know you're not as invested in the video part of it, but do you have something

820
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:08,740
that you think is an improvement you'd like to see happen?

821
00:42:08,740 --> 00:42:11,100
Um, no, no, really.

822
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:13,540
I mean, so far things are pretty good.

823
00:42:13,540 --> 00:42:16,620
I mean, I like the creative way things have been going.

824
00:42:16,620 --> 00:42:18,000
I think it's actually pretty fun.

825
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:23,920
So, and then I get to randomly just put stuff up on the camera and do randomly, you know?

826
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:24,920
Yeah.

827
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:28,800
I think all of us had some app, some apprehensions in one way or another about the change because,

828
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:30,960
you know, change is scary.

829
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:34,560
The shout cast was comfortable, you know, it was gonna be sure for the listeners to

830
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:39,120
like, it's been a change, but like, you know, I, now that we're doing it, I am kind of kicking

831
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:42,580
myself a little bit going, God, we should have done it like three years sooner.

832
00:42:42,580 --> 00:42:46,040
You know, we could have been more on the cutting edge of it, but it is what it is.

833
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:51,280
Like, I don't, no regrets, you know, when all is said and done.

834
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:55,800
The other thing, the other thing I just want to say about video improvements, more, I just,

835
00:42:55,800 --> 00:43:01,760
there's not enough time to produce more B-roll, more things like more user created or out

836
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:05,820
in the road, out in the field, created segments, admittedly, I've been slacking on that a little

837
00:43:05,820 --> 00:43:06,820
bit.

838
00:43:06,820 --> 00:43:08,580
Like I've been trying to do some break segments, but.

839
00:43:08,580 --> 00:43:15,580
Well maybe if I record a ton of footage this week, I can clip a best of thing together.

840
00:43:15,620 --> 00:43:20,440
I'm still trying to do the laser tag stuff, but it's hard to do laser tag footage because

841
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:21,820
the footage is okay.

842
00:43:21,820 --> 00:43:27,540
Um, I know now I'm not the talk over it when I'm recording, but their music is so goddamn

843
00:43:27,540 --> 00:43:31,500
loud and it's just like, all audio can be stripped and replaced though.

844
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:35,900
It's very easy to strip out and you can hear the pew pew and the killing, but I guess I

845
00:43:35,900 --> 00:43:40,180
gotta, I gotta record that and then dub it back in and it should actually just be you

846
00:43:40,180 --> 00:43:44,660
going pew pew, laser beams, pew pew.

847
00:43:44,660 --> 00:43:46,460
All right.

848
00:43:46,460 --> 00:43:51,260
Bobby followed up, uh, SJ100 Matt's question, just wanting to chime in saying, by the way,

849
00:43:51,260 --> 00:43:55,700
we're going to address some of these questions at our Dragon Con panel Saturday at two 30

850
00:43:55,700 --> 00:43:58,700
because it's about taking your audio podcast and moving it to video.

851
00:43:58,700 --> 00:44:03,140
Like we actually have a panel about this thing that we've done here at VOG Network, which

852
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:04,140
is really cool.

853
00:44:04,140 --> 00:44:08,060
So that's going to be Saturday at two 30 PM and that is going to be live streamed on Twitch

854
00:44:08,060 --> 00:44:09,980
at DC Digital Media.

855
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:15,360
Step one in your, you're taking your audio podcast into video is put the cat and isolate

856
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:17,180
the cat in a different part of the house.

857
00:44:17,180 --> 00:44:18,180
Word of God.

858
00:44:18,180 --> 00:44:20,020
That's where he's about to go in a minute.

859
00:44:20,020 --> 00:44:21,020
All right.

860
00:44:21,020 --> 00:44:22,460
Uh, let's go to another tweet here.

861
00:44:22,460 --> 00:44:29,360
Dark Tetsuya with another tweet saying, going back on the president cat thing from last

862
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:30,900
week for a bit.

863
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:36,700
Did you know, apparently Jorudan, the company that was making it, got out of the game industry

864
00:44:36,700 --> 00:44:38,200
some time ago.

865
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:42,200
So we may have to start hashtag save president cat.

866
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:43,620
What do you guys think?

867
00:44:43,620 --> 00:44:45,800
So Jorudan got out of the game industry.

868
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:50,400
Well, if the game sold as bad as everybody said it did, I'm surprised they didn't get

869
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:52,040
out of the game industry a long time ago.

870
00:44:52,040 --> 00:44:55,240
Maybe we can purchase the IP for president cat.

871
00:44:55,240 --> 00:44:56,240
Holy shit.

872
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:57,240
That's the best idea.

873
00:44:57,240 --> 00:44:59,360
Oh my God.

874
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:03,300
Now we have something we can spend all this bitty money on, right Bobby?

875
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:09,380
Can we spend all the subscription money on getting the rights to president cat?

876
00:45:09,380 --> 00:45:10,380
You know what though?

877
00:45:10,380 --> 00:45:12,380
I mean, think about it.

878
00:45:12,380 --> 00:45:20,300
If we did do that and then we get our crack team of, uh, game designers who listen to

879
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:25,860
us all, what, three of them and no, I would, I would buy the rights to present.

880
00:45:25,860 --> 00:45:32,700
I would buy the rights to president cat and give them, give them to Y Y R as a gift.

881
00:45:32,700 --> 00:45:36,580
I was actually sort of thinking about doing like actual legit marketing on it.

882
00:45:36,580 --> 00:45:38,560
They have produced so many hamster games.

883
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:39,560
It's ridiculous.

884
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:40,560
Really?

885
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:41,560
Yes.

886
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:42,560
All right.

887
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:46,180
Anything that's like actually been released in the States or like they all Japanese games?

888
00:45:46,180 --> 00:45:47,540
Well, they did a vert.

889
00:45:47,540 --> 00:45:50,980
They did the SNES version of alien versus predator game boy color.

890
00:45:50,980 --> 00:45:54,020
They had bubble bubble classic and chase HQ, secret police.

891
00:45:54,020 --> 00:45:57,020
So there's some stuff they do that come up as a Yogi bear game.

892
00:45:57,020 --> 00:46:01,440
Oh, and so many hamster club games.

893
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:09,260
There's like one, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

894
00:46:09,260 --> 00:46:13,760
Also the pets hamsters life too, cause obviously they're really, you know, they're good at

895
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:15,160
making hamster games.

896
00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:17,100
That's what we've established here.

897
00:46:17,100 --> 00:46:20,620
And to be fair, actually, as much as we're joking about buying the rights to president

898
00:46:20,620 --> 00:46:23,800
cat, I actually don't think the rights were with that gaming company.

899
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:29,200
I think wasn't the character of Rena, like a comic or something like something that existed

900
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:30,720
on a TV parody.

901
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:34,760
Like I feel like that, that, that cat character actually existed somewhere else.

902
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:37,320
It's a mascot of a blog named Nico punch.

903
00:46:37,320 --> 00:46:38,320
Okay.

904
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:39,320
So, so I go punch him.

905
00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:40,320
I was kind of right.

906
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:41,800
I just didn't know it was a blog.

907
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:42,800
All right.

908
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:47,500
Well, we just licensed it from the blog then fair enough.

909
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:48,500
I bet.

910
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:49,500
I bet.

911
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:51,300
If we ask that guy from the blog is gone.

912
00:46:51,300 --> 00:46:56,860
So I bet if we asked that guy very nicely from the Oh, Iraq studios that made cat president,

913
00:46:56,860 --> 00:46:59,740
we can maybe buy his rights to cat president.

914
00:46:59,740 --> 00:47:00,740
Probably a lot cheaper.

915
00:47:00,740 --> 00:47:01,740
I don't know.

916
00:47:01,740 --> 00:47:02,740
Yeah.

917
00:47:02,740 --> 00:47:03,740
The Nico punch blog is gone.

918
00:47:03,740 --> 00:47:05,880
Apparently they've disbanded after them.

919
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:07,380
Maybe the rights are available.

920
00:47:07,380 --> 00:47:08,380
Stay tuned.

921
00:47:08,380 --> 00:47:09,380
Stay tuned.

922
00:47:09,380 --> 00:47:10,380
All right.

923
00:47:10,380 --> 00:47:11,380
One more question.

924
00:47:11,380 --> 00:47:12,380
We'll just make our own president cat.

925
00:47:12,380 --> 00:47:13,380
You know what?

926
00:47:13,380 --> 00:47:14,380
That's right.

927
00:47:14,380 --> 00:47:18,140
I know it's not technically, technically we made president cat.

928
00:47:18,140 --> 00:47:22,040
That game had a Japanese name that meant like boss cat.

929
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:24,620
We made president cat.

930
00:47:24,620 --> 00:47:30,380
So therefore thusly, and I can just take a picture of Mr. Smoosh with a president cat

931
00:47:30,380 --> 00:47:31,980
hat on like an Abe Lincoln hat.

932
00:47:31,980 --> 00:47:33,700
And that can be president cat.

933
00:47:33,700 --> 00:47:37,300
Yeah, but Midna would be queen cat.

934
00:47:37,300 --> 00:47:41,420
Well, she, uh, uh, Midna can be secretary of milk.

935
00:47:41,420 --> 00:47:43,680
No, she's the queen.

936
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:46,900
She's not nobody's secretary cause she's a girl cat.

937
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:50,100
No, I was thinking secretary of state like Hillary Clinton.

938
00:47:50,100 --> 00:47:51,100
Come on.

939
00:47:51,100 --> 00:47:52,100
All right.

940
00:47:52,100 --> 00:47:53,100
All right.

941
00:47:53,100 --> 00:48:01,780
Anyway, going on to our last tweet from, uh, the annual K it's D underscore annual K I

942
00:48:01,780 --> 00:48:08,220
actually know Daniel K or as I call them on this show, the other DK, uh, so DK is a tweeting

943
00:48:08,220 --> 00:48:14,700
us tonight saying, hi, hello, uh, what makes gaming so exciting for y'all?

944
00:48:14,700 --> 00:48:21,020
I think that's a very blunt, direct, good question to remind us why we do this podcast.

945
00:48:21,020 --> 00:48:25,640
What makes gaming exciting because it's been a part of my entire life and it would feel

946
00:48:25,640 --> 00:48:30,980
weird not having it there be like missing the leg.

947
00:48:30,980 --> 00:48:31,980
What do you think?

948
00:48:31,980 --> 00:48:33,780
What makes gaming exciting for you?

949
00:48:33,780 --> 00:48:41,940
Um, whenever I get a really good story, but it also has, um, like things in the world

950
00:48:41,940 --> 00:48:49,140
that make it unique and special, like, you know, for example, having culture or its own

951
00:48:49,140 --> 00:49:00,060
Conlang or, um, when they put thought into the sociology in the game.

952
00:49:00,060 --> 00:49:05,620
So it's, it's the effort into the world when they build a world that excites me, then I

953
00:49:05,620 --> 00:49:08,980
really want to learn everything I can about it.

954
00:49:08,980 --> 00:49:12,660
You know, I could go all the way back with an answer to this, to when I was like first

955
00:49:12,660 --> 00:49:16,660
gaming on the Atari 2,600 and part of what always drew me to video games was the fact

956
00:49:16,660 --> 00:49:19,900
that I was controlling what was on the television.

957
00:49:19,900 --> 00:49:24,100
You know, usually, you know, you would be watching cable, you'd be watching things that

958
00:49:24,100 --> 00:49:27,020
somebody else made and is sending to your TV.

959
00:49:27,020 --> 00:49:30,820
But when I played Atari 2,600 for the first time, it was playing a game like kaboom.

960
00:49:30,820 --> 00:49:34,780
I was in control of those buckets, trying to catch the bombs that were dropping, you

961
00:49:34,780 --> 00:49:40,240
know, and I was the one that would fail or succeed and have that kind of sense of accomplishment.

962
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:41,740
And so I think it's kind of like both those things.

963
00:49:41,740 --> 00:49:46,800
I think it's like being able, being able to feel like you are part of the art.

964
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:51,740
You know, if we're to say that video games are art, which I do fully believe they are,

965
00:49:51,740 --> 00:49:55,100
you know, movies are art, paintings are art, books are art.

966
00:49:55,100 --> 00:49:57,940
But how often do you get to be a part of those?

967
00:49:57,940 --> 00:50:03,020
I mean, I know there's always kind of like these kind of interesting genre bending things

968
00:50:03,020 --> 00:50:06,700
like choose your own adventure books, let's say, they let you be a part of it, right?

969
00:50:06,700 --> 00:50:10,140
But for the most part, you don't really get to be in those.

970
00:50:10,140 --> 00:50:14,140
But with a video game and gaming, you get to be a part of that.

971
00:50:14,140 --> 00:50:15,540
You're in control.

972
00:50:15,540 --> 00:50:18,620
You're the one that's going to determine success or failure.

973
00:50:18,620 --> 00:50:24,680
Whether that's a very simple, easy, repetitive type of Atari 2,600 old school game like kaboom

974
00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:29,940
or something like that, or to something new and modern and very story driven like Mass

975
00:50:29,940 --> 00:50:30,940
Effect.

976
00:50:30,940 --> 00:50:34,520
You know, ultimately you're in the control of the choices and you're going to determine

977
00:50:34,520 --> 00:50:36,760
what happens to the galaxy in a game like that.

978
00:50:36,760 --> 00:50:39,780
Or even something very open world like Minecraft.

979
00:50:39,780 --> 00:50:44,580
If you want to build a town full of houses shaped like penises, that is your prerogative.

980
00:50:44,580 --> 00:50:45,580
That's your call.

981
00:50:45,580 --> 00:50:47,100
You could do whatever you want.

982
00:50:47,100 --> 00:50:49,140
And so I think it's kind of like those things.

983
00:50:49,140 --> 00:50:53,140
The fact that you become part of the art, I think is what makes gaming exciting for

984
00:50:53,140 --> 00:50:54,680
me.

985
00:50:54,680 --> 00:50:57,140
We have a bonus question from The Other DK.

986
00:50:57,140 --> 00:50:58,340
All right.

987
00:50:58,340 --> 00:50:59,340
Bonus question.

988
00:50:59,340 --> 00:51:04,980
What out there, in quotey fingers, what out there gaming concept do you think will be

989
00:51:04,980 --> 00:51:07,540
released in the near future?

990
00:51:07,540 --> 00:51:13,180
For example, flying cars or something completely outlandish.

991
00:51:13,180 --> 00:51:17,380
What out there gaming concept do you think will be released in the near future?

992
00:51:17,380 --> 00:51:24,980
Well, where my brain goes right off the bat is like HUDs, user display, right?

993
00:51:24,980 --> 00:51:30,860
Like I think I almost feel like GPS and like navigation on something like Google Maps or

994
00:51:30,860 --> 00:51:37,020
Apple Maps or something like GPS navigation in some ways I feel like is inspired by like

995
00:51:37,580 --> 00:51:41,820
those genre of open world games where like the arrow points to your next destination.

996
00:51:41,820 --> 00:51:44,500
Like I kind of feel like GPS is kind of that.

997
00:51:44,500 --> 00:51:47,540
So my answer kind of takes that a step further.

998
00:51:47,540 --> 00:51:52,460
And some of those other things that we do in video games with like, you know, and already

999
00:51:52,460 --> 00:51:56,720
like, you know, if you drive a very modern car like a Tesla or something like I feel

1000
00:51:56,720 --> 00:52:02,180
like a lot of the way those navigate is like things that you've seen in gaming in a way.

1001
00:52:02,180 --> 00:52:07,980
Yeah, it's like you were saying, like AR stuff basically is kind of what we'll see

1002
00:52:07,980 --> 00:52:12,500
all sorts of weird implementations of that because they've already tried to do like some

1003
00:52:12,500 --> 00:52:17,460
sort of AR like like first person shooter games where they have like, you know, this

1004
00:52:17,460 --> 00:52:22,860
weird ass laser gun, like almost like laser tag, but with like your phone strapped to

1005
00:52:22,860 --> 00:52:25,860
it, which that's probably pretty lame.

1006
00:52:25,860 --> 00:52:31,580
But like I can imagine later on, like actually getting a good AR system where it just works

1007
00:52:31,580 --> 00:52:34,700
seamlessly wherever you go, then that could be pretty cool.

1008
00:52:34,700 --> 00:52:37,540
I think you're right on the money with like AR.

1009
00:52:37,540 --> 00:52:41,460
Like right now we think of AR like being used in things like Pokemon Go.

1010
00:52:41,460 --> 00:52:42,980
You know, it's very basic.

1011
00:52:42,980 --> 00:52:44,180
It is very basic.

1012
00:52:44,180 --> 00:52:49,300
But I could see that AR like imagine this now maybe AR in the future.

1013
00:52:49,300 --> 00:52:54,260
Like let's say you're having trouble building IKEA furniture like AR could like look at

1014
00:52:54,260 --> 00:52:57,780
what you've built and show you the next piece and where it goes.

1015
00:52:57,780 --> 00:52:58,780
It just says no.

1016
00:52:58,780 --> 00:52:59,780
Yes.

1017
00:52:59,780 --> 00:53:00,780
No.

1018
00:53:00,980 --> 00:53:01,980
This is all wrong.

1019
00:53:01,980 --> 00:53:02,980
All of this is wrong.

1020
00:53:02,980 --> 00:53:05,260
That little cartoon character with the X.

1021
00:53:05,260 --> 00:53:06,260
But you know what I mean?

1022
00:53:06,260 --> 00:53:07,340
Like like that type of.

1023
00:53:07,340 --> 00:53:09,340
And I think we've we've seen that already.

1024
00:53:09,340 --> 00:53:14,340
Like some very rudimentary versions of that would like placing pretend furniture in a

1025
00:53:14,340 --> 00:53:18,260
home to pretend what your house might look like if you lived in it.

1026
00:53:18,260 --> 00:53:19,260
And that type of thing.

1027
00:53:19,260 --> 00:53:21,700
So I think I think some of those AR gaming concepts, especially when it comes to your

1028
00:53:21,700 --> 00:53:24,260
mobile phone and through your phone, I think you're right on the money.

1029
00:53:24,260 --> 00:53:28,900
I think I think that is like a very valid, like realistic answer to this question.

1030
00:53:28,900 --> 00:53:32,500
That's the type of stuff we're seeing in gaming now that I bet will show up more and more

1031
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:37,780
in the real world that AR and being able to, you know, pretend that things are there and

1032
00:53:37,780 --> 00:53:41,260
help walk you through those types of things I think is going to continue to grow and be

1033
00:53:41,260 --> 00:53:42,260
huge.

1034
00:53:42,260 --> 00:53:44,260
Jamie, I don't want to leave you out of an answer, though.

1035
00:53:44,260 --> 00:53:48,900
What what kind of like out there concept from gaming do you think will be a technology we

1036
00:53:48,900 --> 00:53:51,460
all use in our daily lives?

1037
00:53:51,460 --> 00:53:56,460
I'm thinking I mean, this might sound stupid, but we've been talking about like the whole

1038
00:53:56,460 --> 00:53:57,460
holodeck thing.

1039
00:53:58,020 --> 00:54:04,500
And, you know, they already have those holographic keyboards.

1040
00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:10,060
Could you imagine like having sort of like a holo pad or something that would bring up

1041
00:54:10,060 --> 00:54:17,020
things like interactive displays and you're kind of like almost like having your Wii U

1042
00:54:17,020 --> 00:54:18,340
screen in hand?

1043
00:54:18,340 --> 00:54:19,340
Yeah.

1044
00:54:19,340 --> 00:54:25,900
But instead you have like a holographic HUD or a maybe something that uses AR on your

1045
00:54:25,900 --> 00:54:26,900
phone?

1046
00:54:27,340 --> 00:54:30,340
Or haptics.

1047
00:54:30,340 --> 00:54:32,020
No, I know.

1048
00:54:32,020 --> 00:54:36,060
I know we always joke that like with each generation of gaming, we're getting one step

1049
00:54:36,060 --> 00:54:37,420
closer to the holodeck.

1050
00:54:37,420 --> 00:54:38,420
But it's true.

1051
00:54:38,420 --> 00:54:39,420
Right.

1052
00:54:39,420 --> 00:54:44,100
And especially now that things like VR and AR are becoming more and more like, you know,

1053
00:54:44,100 --> 00:54:48,420
sure, you still have to put on this giant headset to really, truly experience, you know,

1054
00:54:48,420 --> 00:54:49,420
VR.

1055
00:54:49,420 --> 00:54:51,300
Like, I remember like we were like, think about that, like in the 90s.

1056
00:54:51,300 --> 00:54:54,660
And it's like, oh, that's kind of cool and everything, but like, it'll never happen.

1057
00:54:54,660 --> 00:54:57,420
You know, and now it's just like kind of, well, and then that technology is going to

1058
00:54:57,420 --> 00:55:03,260
get more and more light, like, you know, VHS tapes were bulky and now everything is like

1059
00:55:03,260 --> 00:55:04,260
digital.

1060
00:55:04,260 --> 00:55:07,580
And so, you know, it's, there's going to come a time when that technology is not so bulky

1061
00:55:07,580 --> 00:55:12,460
and things like, I know we, Google Glass did not do so well.

1062
00:55:12,460 --> 00:55:16,420
Everybody always joked about glass holes and things like that, but I think there is going

1063
00:55:16,420 --> 00:55:20,860
to come a time when like you're wearing glasses and the glasses already have it.

1064
00:55:20,860 --> 00:55:26,180
There's North, which is a new, there's like $600 glasses.

1065
00:55:26,180 --> 00:55:28,600
They were actually selling them last weekend at Intel.

1066
00:55:28,600 --> 00:55:31,540
They have their pop up shop, but they have like two in the United, one in the United

1067
00:55:31,540 --> 00:55:33,460
States and one in Canada.

1068
00:55:33,460 --> 00:55:35,220
But like they're $600 glasses.

1069
00:55:35,220 --> 00:55:39,340
All they do is like, they show like notifications on your glasses, but it's, it's like projected

1070
00:55:39,340 --> 00:55:45,060
on there and you can see like everything and I wanted it.

1071
00:55:45,060 --> 00:55:49,620
It's complete garbage, like for $600, like I don't need to be spending it, but it's neat

1072
00:55:49,620 --> 00:55:50,620
and I want it.

1073
00:55:50,620 --> 00:55:51,620
So, yeah.

1074
00:55:51,620 --> 00:55:56,560
And you know, what's funny is that our pal Bobby Black Wolf is doing that panel.

1075
00:55:56,560 --> 00:55:58,900
So Bobby got on three tracks this year.

1076
00:55:58,900 --> 00:55:59,900
We were all excited.

1077
00:55:59,900 --> 00:56:02,620
Last year we were on two tracks, digital media and video games.

1078
00:56:02,620 --> 00:56:04,060
Dude, Bobby got on the third.

1079
00:56:04,060 --> 00:56:08,820
He's on the Star Trek track this year because they actually do a panel every year.

1080
00:56:08,820 --> 00:56:10,380
That's like update.

1081
00:56:10,380 --> 00:56:12,860
How much closer is the holodeck to being a reality?

1082
00:56:12,860 --> 00:56:13,860
Oh yes.

1083
00:56:13,860 --> 00:56:18,340
Cause you know, he does a lot with VR, not just as a, as a hobbyist.

1084
00:56:18,380 --> 00:56:23,180
So, uh, he's on that panel this year and I'm actually, I'm excited to check it out personally

1085
00:56:23,180 --> 00:56:27,500
and uh, it's a bummer you don't go to Dragon Con dark soccer cause I bet you'd get a kick

1086
00:56:27,500 --> 00:56:28,500
out of that panel too.

1087
00:56:28,500 --> 00:56:31,460
Want to pay for my ticket?

1088
00:56:31,460 --> 00:56:34,140
Well, I'm, I'm, I'm not that rich sadly.

1089
00:56:34,140 --> 00:56:37,100
I didn't win a million dollars playing survivor unfortunately.

1090
00:56:37,100 --> 00:56:40,460
Um, I got a blanket so I don't have a lot of money to share.

1091
00:56:40,460 --> 00:56:41,860
All right.

1092
00:56:41,860 --> 00:56:42,860
Anyway.

1093
00:56:42,860 --> 00:56:43,860
All right.

1094
00:56:43,860 --> 00:56:45,760
Well that, those were some great questions.

1095
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:46,760
Thank you guys so much.

1096
00:56:46,760 --> 00:56:51,680
I, I feel like we might have to incorporate Twitter questions more often into the show.

1097
00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:53,880
Um, just because we get good stuff on there.

1098
00:56:53,880 --> 00:56:58,080
So no, we haven't played any games recently on the show.

1099
00:56:58,080 --> 00:57:02,520
I know we haven't cause um, I think ever since we switched to video, we kind of left those

1100
00:57:02,520 --> 00:57:03,520
by the wayside.

1101
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:08,640
But um, I think there was talk about using Twitch extensions to bring some of that functionality

1102
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:09,640
back.

1103
00:57:09,640 --> 00:57:13,560
I don't want to say too much cause I don't know what, I don't remember what Bobby told

1104
00:57:13,560 --> 00:57:14,560
me.

1105
00:57:14,560 --> 00:57:16,360
He can't, he can't do, but they are things we're thinking about.

1106
00:57:16,360 --> 00:57:17,920
But yeah, we haven't done any of the games in a while.

1107
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:19,600
We need to bring some of the game shows back.

1108
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:22,400
So anyway, um, great questions.

1109
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:23,400
Yay.

1110
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:25,000
Uh, let's take a trip down memory lane.

1111
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:29,680
Uh, every week dark Sakura jumps into the gaming vault and finds the game that she thinks,

1112
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:35,160
Hey, you guys should put, put your Google glass down and uh, check out this.

1113
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:41,080
You have to, you have to boot this and Ms. Doss, you're going to type C colon backslash.

1114
00:57:41,080 --> 00:57:42,960
Then you're going to type CDs space.

1115
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:43,960
All right.

1116
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:44,960
Dark soccer.

1117
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:47,360
That's actually being very literal cause I know what she picked for tonight.

1118
00:57:47,360 --> 00:57:50,080
So that is the type of way you would have to boot this game, right?

1119
00:57:50,080 --> 00:57:51,080
Dark soccer.

1120
00:57:51,080 --> 00:57:53,340
What did you pick tonight for the classic game of the week?

1121
00:57:53,340 --> 00:58:00,680
I picked jazz Jack rabbit developed and published by Epic mega games.

1122
00:58:00,680 --> 00:58:11,880
It came out in 1994 it came out for PCs operating Doss later on there were Mac and windows versions.

1123
00:58:11,880 --> 00:58:25,440
So this would be like windows 3.1 or one one if you were a networker or windows 95

1124
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:30,200
if you were to afford the newest operating system at the time, but yeah, at any, at any

1125
00:58:30,200 --> 00:58:36,000
rate the game is set in the world based on the tortoise and the hare.

1126
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:42,520
So, but it has the, the hatred between the tortoises and the hares have still gone on

1127
00:58:42,520 --> 00:58:45,040
for 3000 years.

1128
00:58:45,040 --> 00:58:49,480
There's an evil tortoise named Devin shell who started conquering planets and doing just

1129
00:58:49,480 --> 00:58:51,540
general evil things.

1130
00:58:51,540 --> 00:59:00,840
And one of the planets named Cara Tuss, uh, had a peaceful hair kingdom and then was,

1131
00:59:00,840 --> 00:59:08,240
you know, eventually, um, you know, was able to starve off the, uh, the tortoises attacking

1132
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:10,680
and then they kidnapped their princess.

1133
00:59:10,680 --> 00:59:18,920
So of course, because we have the female character only exists to serve as a tag.

1134
00:59:18,920 --> 00:59:23,800
So anyway, we have just Jack rabbit who has to go rescue the princess and he has a light,

1135
00:59:23,800 --> 00:59:30,000
uh, sorry, a blue gun that he goes around shooting things.

1136
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:34,080
He wears a red bandana cause it was the nineties and that's edgy.

1137
00:59:34,080 --> 00:59:35,760
He's also bright green.

1138
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:44,340
And so, um, basically it is, uh, some, uh, platforming, um, you basically go around jumping

1139
00:59:44,340 --> 00:59:45,380
on shit.

1140
00:59:45,380 --> 00:59:46,680
You can shoot shit.

1141
00:59:46,680 --> 00:59:53,600
You can run fast, jump higher the longer that you run kind of Sonic-y, um, but in no way

1142
00:59:53,600 --> 00:59:56,960
there's inspiration from Sonic in this.

1143
00:59:56,960 --> 01:00:06,440
Funny you mentioned that it was actually inspired by Zool for the Amiga, but you know, no one

1144
01:00:06,440 --> 01:00:09,840
has original ideas since, you know, 1982 anyway.

1145
01:00:09,840 --> 01:00:17,000
So at any rate, um, you've got like, you can get a hoverboard and you can get like, uh,

1146
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:23,440
force fields and a sidekick bird and different speeds up and invincibilities, extra lives,

1147
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:24,440
all kinds of stuff like that.

1148
01:00:24,440 --> 01:00:32,440
You can get TNT, get big containers of ammo, but it has like no abysses, like no holes.

1149
01:00:32,440 --> 01:00:35,440
So you just keep going, you can't die by falling.

1150
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:41,440
Um, so as it goes, so the game's divided into six episodes and each episode has three planets

1151
01:00:41,440 --> 01:00:44,880
and worlds and every planet has two levels.

1152
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:49,920
Um, sometimes they have an additional secret level and then, uh, the final level of every

1153
01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:52,200
episode has a boss fight.

1154
01:00:52,200 --> 01:01:00,800
Um, and I think it's like, uh, unlimited continues, I think it's been an agent, I've played it,

1155
01:01:00,800 --> 01:01:10,040
but at any rate, um, it was, uh, you know, inspired by the game Zool for the Amiga and,

1156
01:01:10,040 --> 01:01:15,720
um, and it was driven by the success of other classics like Sonic the Hedgehog and the Mega

1157
01:01:15,720 --> 01:01:18,440
Man series that kept it going on.

1158
01:01:18,440 --> 01:01:26,720
And it was though considered to be, they thought that it was a, uh, a pastiche, which is a

1159
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:30,720
type of visual reference.

1160
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:38,600
One that celebrates, um, Sonic the Hedgehog, but it wasn't quite, you know, that really

1161
01:01:38,600 --> 01:01:39,600
wasn't what it was.

1162
01:01:39,600 --> 01:01:41,440
It was more like it was derived from Zool.

1163
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:46,560
Um, it also had interactive music called Cyber Sound Music System.

1164
01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:51,960
Um, it did get a CD version that had the original six episodes and three additional ones called

1165
01:01:51,960 --> 01:01:53,920
the Lost Episodes.

1166
01:01:53,920 --> 01:01:58,800
Um, and then it had an episode with Jazz as a lizard.

1167
01:01:58,800 --> 01:02:05,080
And then there was a shareware edition that had just a special three level themed episode

1168
01:02:05,080 --> 01:02:07,120
called Holiday Hair.

1169
01:02:07,120 --> 01:02:11,680
Um, this was, uh, from Jack Jazz Rabbit, uh, Jazz Jack Rabbit CD.

1170
01:02:11,680 --> 01:02:17,040
Um, and then there were other like shareware holiday versions.

1171
01:02:17,040 --> 01:02:22,360
And of course then in 1988, there was a sequel and a reboot on Game Boy Advance and then

1172
01:02:22,360 --> 01:02:33,520
a Kickstarter, um, done by one of the co-creators, Cliff Bleszinski, who, uh, actually was later

1173
01:02:33,520 --> 01:02:38,020
on one of the forces in Epic Games' Unreal in Gears of War.

1174
01:02:38,020 --> 01:02:41,080
So we have some tie-ins to current things.

1175
01:02:41,080 --> 01:02:49,240
And of course you can get this on, you know, on other, like, I think it's on GOG and other

1176
01:02:49,240 --> 01:02:54,480
stuff so you can still get the game today.

1177
01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:56,600
So go play it is what you're saying.

1178
01:02:56,600 --> 01:02:57,600
Eh.

1179
01:02:57,600 --> 01:02:58,600
Or not.

1180
01:02:58,600 --> 01:03:05,280
I'll be honest, I was into it for a hot minute when it was like new, but at the time I wasn't

1181
01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:08,920
really so much a fan of playing games on the PC, you know?

1182
01:03:08,920 --> 01:03:13,120
Like my MMO was Gemstone.

1183
01:03:13,120 --> 01:03:18,880
You know, I would play like the point and clicks, but an action game like that, it wasn't

1184
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:23,280
really my, my, my, uh, uh, you know, bottle of vodka.

1185
01:03:23,280 --> 01:03:24,280
All right.

1186
01:03:24,280 --> 01:03:26,280
Well, there it is anyway, your classic game of the week.

1187
01:03:26,280 --> 01:03:27,680
And it's one I play.

1188
01:03:27,680 --> 01:03:31,760
I probably played Jill of the Jungle more, but I still enjoyed some Jazz Jack Rabbit.

1189
01:03:31,760 --> 01:03:32,760
That's for sure.

1190
01:03:32,760 --> 01:03:37,240
So, I mean, go play it, you know, learn some of the roots of your games.

1191
01:03:37,240 --> 01:03:44,040
You know, it's one of those niche appreciation type games that had big appreciation in its

1192
01:03:44,040 --> 01:03:45,040
niche.

1193
01:03:45,040 --> 01:03:46,040
Yeah.

1194
01:03:46,040 --> 01:03:47,040
And you know, yeah.

1195
01:03:47,040 --> 01:03:49,040
And you know, again, cause I don't want to make it sound like we're, we're negative on

1196
01:03:49,040 --> 01:03:50,040
this game.

1197
01:03:50,040 --> 01:03:53,520
We're not, not whatsoever because like this game, I think you didn't really have a lot

1198
01:03:53,520 --> 01:03:55,480
of like platformers on the PC.

1199
01:03:55,480 --> 01:03:58,860
You didn't think of like platforming games, like this was the type of game you would expect

1200
01:03:58,860 --> 01:04:02,760
to see on a Super Nintendo, but instead you got to play it on your PC and that wasn't

1201
01:04:02,760 --> 01:04:03,760
very common.

1202
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:06,520
And I think that's something very important to realize about, you know, the nineties when

1203
01:04:06,520 --> 01:04:10,760
this was out is that seeing these types of platforming games on the PC, especially as

1204
01:04:10,760 --> 01:04:14,000
well-rounded as this, not super common.

1205
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:19,480
So it really felt like, yeah, you were playing something like a Super Nintendo game, but

1206
01:04:19,480 --> 01:04:22,120
on your PC and that was pretty rad.

1207
01:04:22,120 --> 01:04:26,900
And also, you know, there's many people now that think Epic is just the Fortnite company,

1208
01:04:26,900 --> 01:04:32,200
but in reality they've had a huge history in gaming and shareware.

1209
01:04:32,200 --> 01:04:33,200
That's right.

1210
01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:34,200
And shareware.

1211
01:04:34,200 --> 01:04:35,200
That's also very important.

1212
01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:36,200
So there it is.

1213
01:04:36,200 --> 01:04:38,720
Your classic game of the week, Jazz Jackrabbits.

1214
01:04:38,720 --> 01:04:43,120
I'm surprised they have a remaster, didn't they do like an HD remaster of it or something?

1215
01:04:43,120 --> 01:04:46,040
But I'm surprised they haven't like done a sequel or anything.

1216
01:04:46,040 --> 01:04:47,040
Yeah.

1217
01:04:47,040 --> 01:04:48,040
I'm kind of surprised.

1218
01:04:48,040 --> 01:04:49,040
It was like a thing from the Kickstarter.

1219
01:04:49,040 --> 01:04:50,040
Yeah.

1220
01:04:50,040 --> 01:04:51,640
I feel like there was like a mobile thing or whatever.

1221
01:04:51,640 --> 01:04:52,640
Oh yeah.

1222
01:04:52,640 --> 01:04:53,640
Not the same.

1223
01:04:53,640 --> 01:04:54,640
Not the same.

1224
01:04:54,640 --> 01:04:55,640
All right.

1225
01:04:55,640 --> 01:04:56,880
Um, we need to catch up on some news.

1226
01:04:56,880 --> 01:04:59,440
So we're only, you know, we're taping this really partway through the week.

1227
01:04:59,440 --> 01:05:00,880
So we may not get everything.

1228
01:05:00,880 --> 01:05:05,040
There may still be some big news that comes up that we don't get to on Sunday, but there

1229
01:05:05,040 --> 01:05:07,920
have been quite a few headlines to cover nonetheless.

1230
01:05:07,920 --> 01:05:10,160
So let's start talking about some headlines.

1231
01:05:10,160 --> 01:05:14,320
So of course this week we had Gamescom and so there's been lots of announcements for

1232
01:05:14,320 --> 01:05:15,320
that.

1233
01:05:15,320 --> 01:05:20,000
They had this big open night live ceremony thing hosted by Jeff Keighley.

1234
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:23,400
And with that, they showed off a bunch of different trailers for stuff.

1235
01:05:23,400 --> 01:05:26,560
So some of the things covered there, of course, they talked a little bit about Call of Duty

1236
01:05:26,560 --> 01:05:32,320
Modern Warfare, which is having an open alpha that starts on, well would have started on

1237
01:05:32,320 --> 01:05:34,780
Friday, August 23rd.

1238
01:05:34,780 --> 01:05:39,460
And then they announced a sequel to Kerbal Space Program.

1239
01:05:39,460 --> 01:05:43,820
So that's coming in 2020, the consoles and PC.

1240
01:05:43,820 --> 01:05:47,740
There's a game Humankind by Sega.

1241
01:05:47,740 --> 01:05:52,740
That's that was that big AAA game or whatever that they were teasing last week, right?

1242
01:05:52,740 --> 01:05:53,740
Yeah.

1243
01:05:53,740 --> 01:05:56,340
Some simulation game of human history.

1244
01:05:56,340 --> 01:05:57,340
That's coming in 2020.

1245
01:05:57,340 --> 01:06:02,020
I guess that's what makes it AAA because it's all of history in one game.

1246
01:06:02,020 --> 01:06:05,660
Total Nightmares 2 is something that they announced in 2020 as well.

1247
01:06:05,660 --> 01:06:08,700
THQ Nordic is rebooting Comanche.

1248
01:06:08,700 --> 01:06:15,220
So they're doing it's a helicopter action game and that's going to be coming out.

1249
01:06:15,220 --> 01:06:17,380
Need for Speed Heat.

1250
01:06:17,380 --> 01:06:19,260
They've got the Heat Studio that you can download.

1251
01:06:19,260 --> 01:06:22,820
It's a mobile app that you can customize cars because they want you to really buy those

1252
01:06:22,820 --> 01:06:24,460
skins when it comes out.

1253
01:06:24,460 --> 01:06:28,520
A match at the Gathering Arena should be coming.

1254
01:06:28,520 --> 01:06:32,240
It's a semi exclusive to the Epic Games Store.

1255
01:06:32,240 --> 01:06:36,440
Iron Harvest is releasing on September 1st, 2020.

1256
01:06:36,440 --> 01:06:40,120
This game called Disintegration looks pretty awesome.

1257
01:06:40,120 --> 01:06:41,440
They showed that off.

1258
01:06:41,440 --> 01:06:43,760
Not to be confused with a great Cure album.

1259
01:06:43,760 --> 01:06:44,760
No.

1260
01:06:44,760 --> 01:06:47,800
And then, of course, let's see what else.

1261
01:06:47,800 --> 01:06:50,560
And then there was this game called Erika, an interactive thriller.

1262
01:06:50,560 --> 01:06:54,680
Oh, yeah, because I think Erika they announced some time ago and then it was like that was

1263
01:06:54,680 --> 01:06:55,800
like their whole like it's out now.

1264
01:06:55,800 --> 01:06:56,800
It's a PlayLink game.

1265
01:06:56,800 --> 01:06:57,800
Yeah.

1266
01:06:58,080 --> 01:07:00,080
You can use your phones with that.

1267
01:07:00,080 --> 01:07:03,840
And that's available now for 10 bucks on PlayStation 4.

1268
01:07:03,840 --> 01:07:07,640
And then, of course, last but not least, of course, because Jeff Keighley is involved,

1269
01:07:07,640 --> 01:07:12,520
you knew there was another Death Stranding trailer coming and they had a brand new trailer

1270
01:07:12,520 --> 01:07:17,440
showing off some new characters, including Jeff Keighley is actually in the game, not

1271
01:07:17,440 --> 01:07:20,500
voiced by him, which is awfully weird, though.

1272
01:07:20,500 --> 01:07:23,240
And then instead they got Gilbert Gottfried.

1273
01:07:23,240 --> 01:07:24,440
No.

1274
01:07:24,440 --> 01:07:29,160
And then they have was it the one character, Mama, that they showed off that all sorts

1275
01:07:29,160 --> 01:07:30,160
of strange.

1276
01:07:30,160 --> 01:07:31,160
OK.

1277
01:07:31,160 --> 01:07:34,360
You know, she's breastfeeding a ghost baby.

1278
01:07:34,360 --> 01:07:36,440
I didn't see the new trailer.

1279
01:07:36,440 --> 01:07:42,760
I'm I'm kind of all like all my change for Death Stranding hype has been spent.

1280
01:07:42,760 --> 01:07:45,320
That doesn't mean I don't like want to check out the game or anything.

1281
01:07:45,320 --> 01:07:49,080
I'm actually doing the game a favor by holding off on the hype.

1282
01:07:49,080 --> 01:07:50,080
Yes.

1283
01:07:50,080 --> 01:07:52,080
So that when it comes out, I can just play the fucking game.

1284
01:07:52,080 --> 01:07:53,080
Exactly.

1285
01:07:53,080 --> 01:07:54,080
It looks interesting.

1286
01:07:54,720 --> 01:07:55,720
To be to be clear, I'm not being a hater.

1287
01:07:55,720 --> 01:07:57,400
I'm actually doing the game a favor.

1288
01:07:57,400 --> 01:08:00,880
Like I'm worried the more and more we hype this shit up, the more and more we're setting

1289
01:08:00,880 --> 01:08:03,240
ourselves up for a no man's sky type of situation.

1290
01:08:03,240 --> 01:08:05,560
So I'm just going to take the game for what it is when it comes out.

1291
01:08:05,560 --> 01:08:09,720
And then, of course, Microsoft had their own inside Xbox around the same time.

1292
01:08:09,720 --> 01:08:15,600
So they talked a lot of stuff, including definitely cry fives coming to Xbox Game Pass.

1293
01:08:15,600 --> 01:08:16,600
Cool.

1294
01:08:16,600 --> 01:08:22,000
Stellaris console edition, Age of Empires Definitive Edition will be available on the

1295
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:30,320
PC games pass eight out in Kingdom Come Deliverance will be coming August 22nd, which is today.

1296
01:08:30,320 --> 01:08:34,560
And Bard's Tale for director's cut will be coming on the 27th Blair, which is getting

1297
01:08:34,560 --> 01:08:38,120
added to games pass on console and PC.

1298
01:08:38,120 --> 01:08:39,120
I have game pass.

1299
01:08:39,120 --> 01:08:40,120
I have to check that out.

1300
01:08:40,120 --> 01:08:41,520
And that's on August 30th.

1301
01:08:41,520 --> 01:08:47,440
Humans Fall Flat will be going to scary a free level on PC and Xbox one.

1302
01:08:47,440 --> 01:08:53,720
The announced Age of Empires to definitive edition will be coming November 14th and adds

1303
01:08:53,720 --> 01:08:57,400
better AI, 4K graphics and more improvements.

1304
01:08:57,400 --> 01:09:04,180
Gears pop actually came out today on iOS, Android and Windows 10.

1305
01:09:04,180 --> 01:09:11,480
And Gears, let's see, they said that keyboard noises, Jamie, just, you know, they showed

1306
01:09:11,480 --> 01:09:19,960
off something for NBA 2K 20s career mode, which it has, I guess, Idris Elba and Rosario

1307
01:09:19,960 --> 01:09:20,960
Dawson.

1308
01:09:20,960 --> 01:09:21,960
That's pretty cool.

1309
01:09:21,960 --> 01:09:23,960
Like some big name talent for a sports game.

1310
01:09:23,960 --> 01:09:24,960
That's pretty rad.

1311
01:09:24,960 --> 01:09:26,960
Yeah.

1312
01:09:26,960 --> 01:09:33,160
Ghost War, which is a new multiplayer mode for Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Breakpoint is

1313
01:09:33,160 --> 01:09:34,520
something else they showed off.

1314
01:09:34,520 --> 01:09:38,720
And PUBG is getting cross platform play with PlayStation four in an update in October.

1315
01:09:38,720 --> 01:09:39,760
Oh, wow.

1316
01:09:39,760 --> 01:09:44,320
New Xbox one controller designs, including one that looks like camouflage and one they

1317
01:09:44,320 --> 01:09:47,320
call sports blue.

1318
01:09:47,320 --> 01:09:48,400
It's a pretty blue though.

1319
01:09:48,400 --> 01:09:49,400
It is.

1320
01:09:49,400 --> 01:09:52,000
I don't know why it's sports, but it's a pretty color.

1321
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:56,520
They announced that they're going to be holding a fan event called XO 19, um, the weekend

1322
01:09:56,520 --> 01:09:59,360
of November 14th in London.

1323
01:09:59,360 --> 01:10:04,440
And they're going to have some more announcements around then maybe Xbox, whatever the next

1324
01:10:04,440 --> 01:10:07,120
X boxes seems a little soon for that.

1325
01:10:07,120 --> 01:10:09,640
I don't know why you'd announce that just before the shopping season.

1326
01:10:09,640 --> 01:10:13,720
Like I feel like that's true to recap everything that's going to be available for the holiday.

1327
01:10:13,720 --> 01:10:20,480
And the next year we talk about Scarlet, uh, Metro Exodus is getting two kernels DLC coming

1328
01:10:20,480 --> 01:10:21,480
out.

1329
01:10:21,480 --> 01:10:27,600
Uh, well they already came out by now, August 20th and they showed off a gears war five

1330
01:10:27,600 --> 01:10:29,040
hoard mode.

1331
01:10:29,040 --> 01:10:30,040
Of course.

1332
01:10:30,040 --> 01:10:31,040
Yeah.

1333
01:10:31,040 --> 01:10:32,440
So that was pretty cool.

1334
01:10:32,440 --> 01:10:34,080
And here's something quite ironic.

1335
01:10:34,080 --> 01:10:40,260
So last week we talked about how Minecraft is not getting the ultra awesome, um, super

1336
01:10:40,260 --> 01:10:42,240
graphics pack on consoles.

1337
01:10:42,240 --> 01:10:43,240
Right.

1338
01:10:43,240 --> 01:10:49,160
And then right the very next day, Nvidia's like, Oh, but wait, it's coming to PC because

1339
01:10:49,160 --> 01:10:52,980
they have a ray tracing support now announced.

1340
01:10:52,980 --> 01:10:58,160
If you have an RTX, um, a GTX, a G force RTX card, those are pretty high end video cards

1341
01:10:58,160 --> 01:10:59,160
though.

1342
01:10:59,160 --> 01:11:00,160
Aren't they?

1343
01:11:00,160 --> 01:11:01,160
Yeah.

1344
01:11:01,160 --> 01:11:06,440
So I think 20, I don't know if the 20, 60 supports it, but the 20, 70, 20, 80, um, is

1345
01:11:06,440 --> 01:11:10,400
that like a mod or is that like an official, officially supported, it's an officially supported

1346
01:11:10,400 --> 01:11:11,400
thing.

1347
01:11:11,400 --> 01:11:12,400
Huh?

1348
01:11:12,400 --> 01:11:13,400
Interesting.

1349
01:11:13,400 --> 01:11:15,600
So it's gonna, I don't know if this is the windows 10 version of this, but it is showing

1350
01:11:15,600 --> 01:11:19,240
off like some of the, yeah, it looks like the water effects are pretty crazy.

1351
01:11:19,240 --> 01:11:20,240
Yeah.

1352
01:11:20,240 --> 01:11:21,240
So it looks cool.

1353
01:11:21,240 --> 01:11:27,080
Um, and it is something that's kind of, you know, uh, officially out there.

1354
01:11:27,080 --> 01:11:32,440
So I mean, I, I, I don't have a card to take advantage of that cause I have a laptop, but

1355
01:11:32,440 --> 01:11:34,720
it's someday it's about time for me to upgrade.

1356
01:11:34,720 --> 01:11:35,880
So I'm thinking about it.

1357
01:11:35,880 --> 01:11:36,880
It is pretty, yeah.

1358
01:11:36,880 --> 01:11:41,920
I think it might be an holiday gift to myself as to get myself one of those fancy cards.

1359
01:11:41,920 --> 01:11:44,920
And then a GameStop has laid off over a hundred people.

1360
01:11:44,920 --> 01:11:50,760
Um, so apparently they also laid off half the staff for a game informer, which I gotta

1361
01:11:50,760 --> 01:11:54,200
be honest, I get game of former every month and I like thumb through it really quick and

1362
01:11:54,200 --> 01:11:55,200
it goes in the trash.

1363
01:11:55,200 --> 01:11:57,360
So, I mean, that sucks.

1364
01:11:57,360 --> 01:12:01,480
It sucks that they know people's jobs are being gone, but I kind of understand at least

1365
01:12:01,480 --> 01:12:03,440
the press mega, the, the print magazine.

1366
01:12:03,440 --> 01:12:07,920
I understand that it's kind of print magazines, a harder and harder thing to push these days.

1367
01:12:07,920 --> 01:12:08,920
It's sad.

1368
01:12:08,920 --> 01:12:09,920
Yeah.

1369
01:12:09,920 --> 01:12:12,360
Um, because it's just a lot of the news that we get out of there.

1370
01:12:12,360 --> 01:12:16,160
It's just like, it's old by the time you get it, um, getting harder and harder for them

1371
01:12:16,160 --> 01:12:20,500
to get exclusive news, which was kind of one thing that was keeping them going because

1372
01:12:20,500 --> 01:12:25,180
GameStop is starting to lose more and more of a foothold on the game sales market as

1373
01:12:25,180 --> 01:12:26,780
more goes digital.

1374
01:12:26,780 --> 01:12:30,480
You know, the, the Walmarts and targets of the world keep selling games and you know,

1375
01:12:30,480 --> 01:12:35,960
so it's GameStop is a company we've been saying this for years, it's kind of been in trouble.

1376
01:12:35,960 --> 01:12:41,160
You know, obviously I think they're going to pivot a little bit from just selling video

1377
01:12:41,160 --> 01:12:44,500
games and that you're already seeing that, that they sell more like gaming memorabilia

1378
01:12:44,500 --> 01:12:47,060
and stuff, shirts, things like that.

1379
01:12:47,060 --> 01:12:50,420
But I either they're going to continue to pivot that way or they're going to,

1380
01:12:50,420 --> 01:12:54,580
and you know what, the thing that sucks the most about like that idea, like, and I've

1381
01:12:54,580 --> 01:12:58,900
said it so many times when I go in there, like I like the fact that they have the merchandise

1382
01:12:58,900 --> 01:13:02,340
and stuff and then they have merchandise for like kids and everything like that.

1383
01:13:02,340 --> 01:13:03,340
But guess what?

1384
01:13:03,340 --> 01:13:05,740
They don't have, they don't have shirts for kids.

1385
01:13:05,740 --> 01:13:07,340
They don't have kid sizes for shirts.

1386
01:13:07,340 --> 01:13:08,340
They're all adult sizes.

1387
01:13:08,340 --> 01:13:13,180
I'm like, so many times I would go and buy, I would totally buy a shirt for my son, but

1388
01:13:13,180 --> 01:13:15,740
they don't have sizes for him.

1389
01:13:15,740 --> 01:13:17,660
And it's just, it's kind of frustrating.

1390
01:13:18,100 --> 01:13:21,500
Not even like just, they have such a huge selection of shirts.

1391
01:13:21,500 --> 01:13:26,380
Just make a small section of that or small percentage of it, kid sizes.

1392
01:13:26,380 --> 01:13:29,380
And then I might be, because obviously kids are coming in because you're selling like

1393
01:13:29,380 --> 01:13:34,020
Ryan's World toys and like the random loot box crap that they have or the surprise eggs

1394
01:13:34,020 --> 01:13:35,400
and that kind of thing.

1395
01:13:35,400 --> 01:13:40,540
So obviously you are gearing towards that crowd, but like bring some of that stuff in

1396
01:13:40,540 --> 01:13:43,900
so that we can buy some of that, you know, because you would think a lot of parents be

1397
01:13:43,900 --> 01:13:48,540
like, oh yeah, hey, I want to buy your shirt and get them interested in stuff, but they

1398
01:13:48,540 --> 01:13:52,300
don't have that available, which is such like a loss of potential, I think.

1399
01:13:52,300 --> 01:13:53,300
Yeah, I hear you.

1400
01:13:53,300 --> 01:13:54,300
I agree.

1401
01:13:54,300 --> 01:13:59,500
So anyways, this was apparently part of their previously announced GameStop reboot initiative

1402
01:13:59,500 --> 01:14:05,220
to transform their business for future and improve their financial performance.

1403
01:14:05,220 --> 01:14:11,140
They said we can confirm the workforce reduction was implemented impacting more than 120 corporate

1404
01:14:11,140 --> 01:14:15,940
staff positions representing an approximate 14 percent of our total associate base at

1405
01:14:15,940 --> 01:14:19,980
our company headquarters, as well as some of the other offices.

1406
01:14:19,980 --> 01:14:23,940
While these changes are difficult, they were necessary to reduce costs and better align

1407
01:14:23,940 --> 01:14:29,140
the organization with our efforts to optimize the business to meet our future objectives

1408
01:14:29,140 --> 01:14:30,140
and success.

1409
01:14:30,140 --> 01:14:31,140
Blah, blah, blah, blah.

1410
01:14:31,140 --> 01:14:37,780
Basically, you know, they're trying to reduce costs and realign what their focus as a company

1411
01:14:37,780 --> 01:14:38,780
is.

1412
01:14:39,420 --> 01:14:42,660
In other words, this is the last ditch ever to save us from total bankruptcy.

1413
01:14:42,660 --> 01:14:47,660
I don't know if it's last ditch, but it's kind of like it's we're getting we're they're

1414
01:14:47,660 --> 01:14:48,660
pivoting.

1415
01:14:48,660 --> 01:14:49,660
Yeah, pivoting.

1416
01:14:49,660 --> 01:14:50,660
Yes.

1417
01:14:50,660 --> 01:14:55,140
We'll we'll stick with that as we knew that this announcement was coming, that we finally

1418
01:14:55,140 --> 01:15:00,660
got our announcement trailer for the television Amico and they showed off.

1419
01:15:00,660 --> 01:15:05,860
There was a few I don't know if it was 17 games, but there's 17 games that will be launching.

1420
01:15:05,940 --> 01:15:10,500
OK, hold up, though, because the trailer wasn't like I was thinking it was going to be like

1421
01:15:10,500 --> 01:15:11,500
a trip.

1422
01:15:11,500 --> 01:15:16,540
OK, so that trailer was like a whole bunch of like shots of the Amico, which, you know,

1423
01:15:16,540 --> 01:15:17,540
it does.

1424
01:15:17,540 --> 01:15:18,540
It looks nice.

1425
01:15:18,540 --> 01:15:22,940
Seeing those little controller screens in action was pretty mixed in with Tommy being

1426
01:15:22,940 --> 01:15:28,100
Tommy and talking a lot for like a good three and a half minutes of that trailer.

1427
01:15:28,100 --> 01:15:32,300
And then like the last maybe forty five seconds was bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam.

1428
01:15:32,300 --> 01:15:34,620
Just a bunch of screenshots of games.

1429
01:15:34,620 --> 01:15:36,100
Don't know what they are.

1430
01:15:36,100 --> 01:15:37,100
Don't know much.

1431
01:15:37,100 --> 01:15:38,860
I mean, unless you can kind of figure it out by looking.

1432
01:15:38,860 --> 01:15:40,020
Don't really know a lot about them.

1433
01:15:40,020 --> 01:15:41,020
Just bam, bam, bam, bam, bam.

1434
01:15:41,020 --> 01:15:44,820
It looked like a few a few games I recognize, like kind of look like remakes of like I definitely

1435
01:15:44,820 --> 01:15:47,300
some remakes of old properties in there for sure.

1436
01:15:47,300 --> 01:15:52,940
I mean, a lot of them kind of looked like Android cell phone gamey, but like I'm not

1437
01:15:52,940 --> 01:15:53,940
really shading.

1438
01:15:53,940 --> 01:15:54,940
They are.

1439
01:15:54,940 --> 01:15:56,740
It's supposed to be a cheap frickin console.

1440
01:15:56,740 --> 01:15:57,740
So I get it.

1441
01:15:57,740 --> 01:15:59,860
I get the quality of the games is not going to be Grand Theft Auto.

1442
01:15:59,860 --> 01:16:00,860
No, I understand that.

1443
01:16:00,860 --> 01:16:03,780
And two, there's all the games every two ninety nine to nine ninety nine.

1444
01:16:03,780 --> 01:16:07,700
No DLC, no in-app purchases, whatever in a family friendly.

1445
01:16:07,700 --> 01:16:08,700
So I get that.

1446
01:16:08,700 --> 01:16:10,240
And that's fine.

1447
01:16:10,240 --> 01:16:15,880
It did look like a lot of the games and I'm trying not to like say this in a way to dog

1448
01:16:15,880 --> 01:16:20,380
on the console, but a lot of it looked like, you know, kind of those cheap like, oh, we're

1449
01:16:20,380 --> 01:16:25,300
remastering some of these classic arcade games, you know, with slightly better graphics that

1450
01:16:25,300 --> 01:16:28,700
you saw, like on the PlayStation one type things.

1451
01:16:28,700 --> 01:16:34,620
Whereas I would want to see more retro style games like like Shovel Knight type game or,

1452
01:16:34,620 --> 01:16:40,060
you know, something that's like, you know, that retro style graphics that not necessarily

1453
01:16:40,060 --> 01:16:43,020
trying to like take an old game and make it like slightly newer.

1454
01:16:43,020 --> 01:16:46,780
If you want to do that, like, you know, they have the Space Invaders Extreme or something

1455
01:16:46,780 --> 01:16:49,580
like that, where it's still keeping that kind of classic look.

1456
01:16:49,580 --> 01:16:51,820
But updating the gameplay would be kind of cool.

1457
01:16:51,820 --> 01:16:54,200
But then again, we had it's hard to tell based on what is.

1458
01:16:54,200 --> 01:16:56,540
And I also thought it's still so early to pass.

1459
01:16:56,540 --> 01:16:59,340
I thought that they weren't doing like 3D games and stuff in there.

1460
01:16:59,340 --> 01:17:01,780
I thought it was supposed to be just like 2D games.

1461
01:17:01,780 --> 01:17:04,740
I think you can use like 3D models in a 2D game.

1462
01:17:04,740 --> 01:17:07,860
Some of it looked like it was 3D, like they have that plane thing.

1463
01:17:07,860 --> 01:17:10,100
I don't know what that was all about, but who knows?

1464
01:17:10,100 --> 01:17:11,100
It's hard to tell.

1465
01:17:11,100 --> 01:17:12,100
Yeah.

1466
01:17:12,100 --> 01:17:15,260
I mean, there's some things that probably kind of get to break the rules a little bit.

1467
01:17:15,260 --> 01:17:19,540
But yeah, I mean, it's it is it's way too early to pass off judgment.

1468
01:17:19,540 --> 01:17:21,060
You know, I don't want to sound like I'm shading.

1469
01:17:21,060 --> 01:17:23,660
I'm not, you know, let's hear more about the games.

1470
01:17:23,660 --> 01:17:28,880
I remain open to Amico just because of the fact that the games are going to be so cheap,

1471
01:17:28,880 --> 01:17:29,880
you know?

1472
01:17:29,880 --> 01:17:30,880
Yeah.

1473
01:17:30,880 --> 01:17:33,060
Some of those games, OK, they look like three dollar games, but they are three dollar games.

1474
01:17:33,060 --> 01:17:35,420
You know, there maybe there's going to be there's nothing wrong with that.

1475
01:17:35,420 --> 01:17:36,880
Yeah, there's nothing wrong with that.

1476
01:17:36,880 --> 01:17:38,420
So let's let's hear more.

1477
01:17:38,420 --> 01:17:39,420
Let's let's see.

1478
01:17:39,420 --> 01:17:40,420
I'm curious.

1479
01:17:40,420 --> 01:17:44,020
I'm always a big proponent about I know they're talking about families playing in the same

1480
01:17:44,020 --> 01:17:47,180
room, but I'm curious if these things are going to do anything online.

1481
01:17:47,180 --> 01:17:50,900
I guess does Amico even have online capability or did they just cut that out?

1482
01:17:50,900 --> 01:17:51,900
How do you buy the games?

1483
01:17:51,900 --> 01:17:52,900
Oh, oh, online.

1484
01:17:53,220 --> 01:17:54,220
Oh, online multiplayer.

1485
01:17:54,220 --> 01:17:55,220
Yeah.

1486
01:17:55,220 --> 01:17:56,220
No, no boards.

1487
01:17:56,220 --> 01:17:57,980
I don't think there's going to be online multiplayer.

1488
01:17:57,980 --> 01:18:00,820
I think it's only going to be within the same room because that's what they're talking about

1489
01:18:00,820 --> 01:18:05,620
is bringing the family get together to ice again for the price.

1490
01:18:05,620 --> 01:18:06,660
I sort of get that.

1491
01:18:06,660 --> 01:18:11,760
I'm not expecting it to be like freaking Xbox, Xbox online or something like Xbox Live.

1492
01:18:11,760 --> 01:18:14,820
But I was just kind of like, oh, it would be neat if like in some of these retro games,

1493
01:18:14,820 --> 01:18:18,960
you could do clips or but I guess the consoles just probably not going to be powerful enough

1494
01:18:18,960 --> 01:18:23,400
to do a lot of those modern privileges, if you will.

1495
01:18:23,400 --> 01:18:26,460
But I really I still want to see what the games really are.

1496
01:18:26,460 --> 01:18:30,920
You know, I'm hoping that it's not going to become a new year and that that's my only

1497
01:18:30,920 --> 01:18:37,860
worry because it kind of I'm hopeful that it will be handled well and I think it will

1498
01:18:37,860 --> 01:18:38,860
be.

1499
01:18:38,860 --> 01:18:43,040
But like in the back of my mind, I'm still kind of the ooh yeah vibes.

1500
01:18:43,040 --> 01:18:44,040
I get it.

1501
01:18:44,040 --> 01:18:45,040
I get it.

1502
01:18:45,040 --> 01:18:46,280
Because that was the ooh yeah thing, too.

1503
01:18:46,280 --> 01:18:48,140
They're like, oh, our games are going to be cheap.

1504
01:18:48,140 --> 01:18:49,140
They're going to be inexpensive.

1505
01:18:49,140 --> 01:18:51,220
They're going to have like free demos and stuff like that.

1506
01:18:51,220 --> 01:18:55,660
And then it's just like you you got what you paid for with like cheap games like that.

1507
01:18:55,660 --> 01:18:59,860
A lot of them are pretty cheap experiences, but that's not to say that it's going to happen

1508
01:18:59,860 --> 01:19:00,860
again.

1509
01:19:00,860 --> 01:19:03,860
That's not to say that every time that some concept like this comes out, that's going

1510
01:19:03,860 --> 01:19:06,300
to be the same thing every time.

1511
01:19:06,300 --> 01:19:09,700
So I want to see what's going to be on there.

1512
01:19:09,700 --> 01:19:10,700
It's early.

1513
01:19:10,700 --> 01:19:12,180
We'll give we'll keep seeing what develops.

1514
01:19:12,180 --> 01:19:13,180
Yes.

1515
01:19:13,180 --> 01:19:14,180
All right.

1516
01:19:14,180 --> 01:19:15,180
All right.

1517
01:19:15,220 --> 01:19:22,900
And then Sony has apparently purchased Insomniac Games, the recent Spider-Man game and a lot

1518
01:19:22,900 --> 01:19:25,140
of Spider-Man ratchet and clank resistance.

1519
01:19:25,140 --> 01:19:26,140
Please.

1520
01:19:26,140 --> 01:19:27,140
New resistance game.

1521
01:19:27,140 --> 01:19:28,680
I'd love a new resistance game.

1522
01:19:28,680 --> 01:19:31,700
It's definitely time and of course, Sunset Overdrive.

1523
01:19:31,700 --> 01:19:33,140
So I guess we're not getting this equal that.

1524
01:19:33,140 --> 01:19:38,620
But I'm curious to see, though, because they had even with Sunset Overdrive was an awesome

1525
01:19:38,620 --> 01:19:39,620
game.

1526
01:19:39,620 --> 01:19:40,620
And I don't know.

1527
01:19:40,620 --> 01:19:41,700
This is a great studio.

1528
01:19:41,700 --> 01:19:45,340
So I'd be curious to see what new IPs could come out from them.

1529
01:19:45,340 --> 01:19:50,140
I'm curious what their PlayStation five game must be, because very curious.

1530
01:19:50,140 --> 01:19:52,820
Clearly, that's going to be something in development.

1531
01:19:52,820 --> 01:19:54,340
Yeah.

1532
01:19:54,340 --> 01:19:57,700
And then so some more stuff real quick.

1533
01:19:57,700 --> 01:20:03,660
So they announced the Mortal Kombat 11 DLC fighters, which is pretty cool.

1534
01:20:03,660 --> 01:20:08,180
Is it just me or does it really look?

1535
01:20:08,180 --> 01:20:09,180
Really look what?

1536
01:20:09,180 --> 01:20:10,180
You cut out there.

1537
01:20:10,180 --> 01:20:11,180
Really?

1538
01:20:11,180 --> 01:20:12,180
Look what does.

1539
01:20:12,180 --> 01:20:15,140
Is it just me or does Terminator really look like Arnold?

1540
01:20:15,140 --> 01:20:16,140
Yes.

1541
01:20:16,140 --> 01:20:20,820
Well, even not necessarily term, you know, the T-800, but they also had, you know, Shang

1542
01:20:20,820 --> 01:20:23,460
Zun looks just like the actor from the Mortal Kombat.

1543
01:20:23,460 --> 01:20:24,460
We already seen that, though.

1544
01:20:24,460 --> 01:20:25,460
Yeah.

1545
01:20:25,460 --> 01:20:26,460
I understand that.

1546
01:20:26,460 --> 01:20:27,980
All that stuff's already out.

1547
01:20:27,980 --> 01:20:28,980
Spawns.

1548
01:20:28,980 --> 01:20:29,980
Yeah.

1549
01:20:29,980 --> 01:20:30,980
Spawns.

1550
01:20:30,980 --> 01:20:31,980
Awesome.

1551
01:20:31,980 --> 01:20:32,980
But yeah, like the Arnold.

1552
01:20:32,980 --> 01:20:33,980
The Arnold model is awesome.

1553
01:20:33,980 --> 01:20:36,220
I'm kind of mixed on the Joker.

1554
01:20:36,220 --> 01:20:39,820
I think the Joker kind of looks, but then I kind of went back and looked at like what

1555
01:20:39,860 --> 01:20:44,380
they did for injustice and stuff, and it kind of looks better than that.

1556
01:20:44,380 --> 01:20:48,820
So I like that Joker doesn't look like any of the actors that have played Joker.

1557
01:20:48,820 --> 01:20:51,460
I like that they let Joker be something new.

1558
01:20:51,460 --> 01:20:53,500
I'm looking forward to Sindel, though.

1559
01:20:53,500 --> 01:20:54,500
Me too.

1560
01:20:54,500 --> 01:20:55,860
I stand Sindel in the old games.

1561
01:20:55,860 --> 01:20:58,220
Like I used to love Sindel in Mortal Kombat 3.

1562
01:20:58,220 --> 01:21:03,140
I want more story content, though, with Sindel being in there because she was I mean, basically

1563
01:21:03,140 --> 01:21:07,220
it was because of her that all the revenant characters were around.

1564
01:21:07,220 --> 01:21:11,220
I feel like I'll finally pick up Mortal Kombat 11 when all these characters are out and they

1565
01:21:11,220 --> 01:21:14,100
release that inevitable Game of the Year collection for 20 bucks.

1566
01:21:14,100 --> 01:21:17,300
That's that's what I'm waiting on.

1567
01:21:17,300 --> 01:21:23,980
So then Dead by Daylight announced that they're getting Stranger Things crossover DLC, which

1568
01:21:23,980 --> 01:21:24,980
looks awesome.

1569
01:21:24,980 --> 01:21:28,060
So it's going to add the Demogorgon as one of the monsters.

1570
01:21:28,060 --> 01:21:35,180
They're going to have also Steve Harrington and Nancy Wheeler as characters.

1571
01:21:35,180 --> 01:21:39,500
Oh, they didn't want to put children in because it's a killy killy stab stab game, but you

1572
01:21:39,500 --> 01:21:40,500
put in.

1573
01:21:40,500 --> 01:21:42,020
OK, so they put in the older teens.

1574
01:21:42,020 --> 01:21:43,020
Interesting.

1575
01:21:43,020 --> 01:21:44,020
Yes.

1576
01:21:44,020 --> 01:21:49,540
And then, of course, they also have the Hawkins National Laboratory is one of the their underground

1577
01:21:49,540 --> 01:21:52,420
complex is one of the levels that's added in there.

1578
01:21:52,420 --> 01:21:56,100
Please tell me that Steve is wearing his Scoops Ahoy outfit.

1579
01:21:56,100 --> 01:21:57,180
He's not.

1580
01:21:57,180 --> 01:22:00,300
But that's not to say that they don't have like costumes or whatever.

1581
01:22:00,300 --> 01:22:01,300
OK, good.

1582
01:22:01,740 --> 01:22:06,020
And technically and technically, if you want to be canon with the show, it should be Jonathan

1583
01:22:06,020 --> 01:22:11,420
Byers that's with him or with Nancy, not necessarily Steve Harrington, but you can't you can't

1584
01:22:11,420 --> 01:22:12,420
argue with the hair.

1585
01:22:12,420 --> 01:22:17,180
I mean, and he's definitely more more popular of a character they could do if it's successful.

1586
01:22:17,180 --> 01:22:19,380
They could do like Jonathan and Billy maybe.

1587
01:22:19,380 --> 01:22:23,700
So when are we going to get like a giant like because I get it dead by daylight.

1588
01:22:23,700 --> 01:22:27,380
I think it's not like a 4v1 or is it like, you know, something like that.

1589
01:22:27,380 --> 01:22:34,180
When are we going to get the big like battle royale like we've got like 30 or 40 monsters

1590
01:22:34,180 --> 01:22:36,500
hunting down like 100 people type thing.

1591
01:22:36,500 --> 01:22:38,200
That would be amazing.

1592
01:22:38,200 --> 01:22:41,380
That game still performs very well on live streams and stuff.

1593
01:22:41,380 --> 01:22:44,660
And, you know, it's still like I always see people streaming it on Twitch.

1594
01:22:44,660 --> 01:22:48,980
So wait, I imagine the developers, if they can sell more copies by putting in a huge

1595
01:22:48,980 --> 01:22:51,980
battle royale type of thing, I would be down for it.

1596
01:22:51,980 --> 01:22:52,980
It might happen.

1597
01:22:52,980 --> 01:22:56,700
And then last but not least, I would say this is pretty cool.

1598
01:22:56,700 --> 01:23:02,860
Mario and Sonic at the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020 is coming out and they have this new

1599
01:23:02,860 --> 01:23:03,940
mode that they in there.

1600
01:23:03,940 --> 01:23:05,100
It's a retro mode.

1601
01:23:05,100 --> 01:23:09,820
So it actually has the different events done in the style of their eight bit and 16 bit

1602
01:23:09,820 --> 01:23:10,820
counterparts.

1603
01:23:10,820 --> 01:23:11,820
OK, that's pretty rad.

1604
01:23:11,820 --> 01:23:12,820
I like that.

1605
01:23:12,820 --> 01:23:14,140
It looks like track and field, like the old Konami.

1606
01:23:14,140 --> 01:23:15,140
They have track and field.

1607
01:23:15,140 --> 01:23:16,520
They have like diving.

1608
01:23:16,520 --> 01:23:19,140
They have all of the events are in a retro mode.

1609
01:23:19,140 --> 01:23:24,300
OK, that's cool, which honestly, this right here, I feel should have been its own game

1610
01:23:24,300 --> 01:23:27,340
and release as part of like the switch online thing.

1611
01:23:27,340 --> 01:23:31,580
Oh, because that way it really should have been its own thing.

1612
01:23:31,580 --> 01:23:34,660
They could sell the retro only version for like 10 bucks or something.

1613
01:23:34,660 --> 01:23:35,660
That would be fun.

1614
01:23:35,660 --> 01:23:38,180
But I guess probably cost more money than that to develop.

1615
01:23:38,180 --> 01:23:39,860
I wouldn't be able to make their money back just on that.

1616
01:23:39,860 --> 01:23:41,620
But I love the retro mode idea.

1617
01:23:41,620 --> 01:23:42,620
That's pretty cool.

1618
01:23:42,620 --> 01:23:43,620
Yeah.

1619
01:23:43,620 --> 01:23:44,620
They've got like all the different events were in there.

1620
01:23:44,620 --> 01:23:49,220
I like they had oh, I was trying to pull up real quick.

1621
01:23:49,220 --> 01:23:50,220
They had one.

1622
01:23:50,220 --> 01:23:54,020
It was it's judo or something like that.

1623
01:23:54,020 --> 01:23:59,140
And so they have the princess and oh, my God, that's amazing.

1624
01:23:59,140 --> 01:24:00,620
It's just it's awesome.

1625
01:24:00,620 --> 01:24:02,500
And they put some Masonic shitty friends in there, too.

1626
01:24:02,500 --> 01:24:04,980
Yes, they have sonic shitty friends in there.

1627
01:24:04,980 --> 01:24:05,980
Wonderful.

1628
01:24:05,980 --> 01:24:08,000
All right, that's it for news.

1629
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:09,000
That's it for news.

1630
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:11,260
Quite a bit of news for just a few days into the week.

1631
01:24:11,260 --> 01:24:16,380
So sadly, with this airing on Sunday, we don't know what will have developed in the Friday,

1632
01:24:16,380 --> 01:24:17,380
Saturday, Sunday.

1633
01:24:17,380 --> 01:24:20,860
But I don't think even games comes going on right now is still there's no more news for

1634
01:24:20,860 --> 01:24:21,860
games com.

1635
01:24:22,340 --> 01:24:24,460
You know, stuff always develops.

1636
01:24:24,460 --> 01:24:26,460
There's always something to blog about in the gaming world.

1637
01:24:26,460 --> 01:24:27,460
Come on.

1638
01:24:27,460 --> 01:24:28,460
Yeah.

1639
01:24:28,460 --> 01:24:29,460
Yeah.

1640
01:24:29,460 --> 01:24:30,460
Something will happen over the weekend.

1641
01:24:30,460 --> 01:24:33,820
But we'll we'll catch up on all of that when we come back after Labor Day holiday.

1642
01:24:33,820 --> 01:24:37,280
But believe it or not, we're getting to about that time where we're going to wrap things

1643
01:24:37,280 --> 01:24:41,580
up and go around to get some final thoughts and wrap things up in the studio tonight.

1644
01:24:41,580 --> 01:24:45,100
I hope everybody has a great week off for those that are going to Dragon Con.

1645
01:24:45,100 --> 01:24:46,380
I can't wait to see you guys there.

1646
01:24:46,380 --> 01:24:48,580
I'm very excited about it.

1647
01:24:48,580 --> 01:24:51,580
There's a lot of great stuff going on, as we say, towards the end of every episode of

1648
01:24:51,580 --> 01:24:52,980
Orange Laundrio.

1649
01:24:52,980 --> 01:24:54,220
Tell a friend or two about the show.

1650
01:24:54,220 --> 01:24:57,340
Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice.

1651
01:24:57,340 --> 01:25:03,140
But only if the voices are here to air, you know, out on air.

1652
01:25:03,140 --> 01:25:04,140
That's it.

1653
01:25:04,140 --> 01:25:07,140
Five star review on a site like iTunes or wherever you found this podcast.

1654
01:25:07,140 --> 01:25:10,780
That goes an awful long way.

1655
01:25:10,780 --> 01:25:11,780
Dark Soccer.

1656
01:25:11,780 --> 01:25:14,740
Sorry you couldn't be here tonight, but I'm glad we got you in the virtual sense anyway,

1657
01:25:14,740 --> 01:25:16,700
even if even if we hear you typing away over there.

1658
01:25:16,700 --> 01:25:17,700
But that's OK.

1659
01:25:17,700 --> 01:25:18,700
Do you have a final thought?

1660
01:25:18,820 --> 01:25:23,260
I was just trying to get a few something popped up as kind of an emergency thing.

1661
01:25:23,260 --> 01:25:24,260
So I was getting it taken care of.

1662
01:25:24,260 --> 01:25:25,260
All right.

1663
01:25:25,260 --> 01:25:26,260
Fair enough.

1664
01:25:26,260 --> 01:25:31,020
Do you have any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?

1665
01:25:31,020 --> 01:25:33,780
Make Mr. Rogers proud of you.

1666
01:25:33,780 --> 01:25:35,520
I like that.

1667
01:25:35,520 --> 01:25:40,380
My final thought tonight is that lots of big changes and good things are in store.

1668
01:25:40,380 --> 01:25:42,920
I hope I can tell you more in two weeks when we come back.

1669
01:25:42,920 --> 01:25:44,900
So stay tuned for that.

1670
01:25:44,900 --> 01:25:48,100
Not all of it is necessarily show related, though I am going to work on the bumpers.

1671
01:25:48,500 --> 01:25:51,500
I'm really excited, too, about like networking and stealing.

1672
01:25:51,500 --> 01:25:54,300
I mean, borrowing lots of good ideas at Dragon Con.

1673
01:25:54,300 --> 01:25:58,260
Really looking forward to meeting other Twitch streamers and stealing some good ideas.

1674
01:25:58,260 --> 01:25:59,260
I mean, borrowing.

1675
01:25:59,260 --> 01:26:01,800
Loki, last but not least, sir, your final thought.

1676
01:26:01,800 --> 01:26:07,780
So I like I said, we start in the game jam on Saturday at noon.

1677
01:26:07,780 --> 01:26:10,740
I don't know how much time I'm going to get the stream on the weekend.

1678
01:26:10,740 --> 01:26:15,500
I'm going to hopefully I will be streaming this week, though, hopefully a lot.

1679
01:26:15,500 --> 01:26:19,780
And I've my wife's actually out of town this week.

1680
01:26:19,780 --> 01:26:21,940
So that means working late at night.

1681
01:26:21,940 --> 01:26:26,420
So I'm hoping with the extra time I can actually get in there and be able to put something

1682
01:26:26,420 --> 01:26:27,420
together.

1683
01:26:27,420 --> 01:26:30,620
I really, really want to finish something.

1684
01:26:30,620 --> 01:26:31,860
I really do.

1685
01:26:31,860 --> 01:26:36,220
I don't want to perpetuate this stereotype that I can't finish any games.

1686
01:26:36,220 --> 01:26:43,760
But yeah, so, you know, check me out at twitch.tv slash lokiolar and hopefully you'll see me

1687
01:26:43,760 --> 01:26:49,520
streaming this week and we'll have a lot of fun at least watching me fail if if nothing

1688
01:26:49,520 --> 01:26:50,520
else.

1689
01:26:50,520 --> 01:26:51,520
Yes.

1690
01:26:51,520 --> 01:26:54,880
Speaking of watching things on Twitch, I mean, certainly watching you do that will be a lot

1691
01:26:54,880 --> 01:26:55,880
of fun.

1692
01:26:55,880 --> 01:26:59,560
Also, during Labor Day weekend, keep in mind at VOG Network, we're going to be hosting

1693
01:26:59,560 --> 01:27:02,780
the Dragon Con media track so that a lot of these great panels are talking about stealing

1694
01:27:02,780 --> 01:27:03,940
ideas from.

1695
01:27:03,940 --> 01:27:08,440
You can do that as well by watching all the great content over on the Dragon Con media

1696
01:27:08,440 --> 01:27:13,200
page or excuse me, Dragon Con digital media track page, which will be hosted here at VOG

1697
01:27:13,200 --> 01:27:14,200
Network.

1698
01:27:14,200 --> 01:27:19,640
And I'm told that even the ones that don't air live will be shown later on.

1699
01:27:19,640 --> 01:27:21,120
They're still recording everything in the other rooms.

1700
01:27:21,120 --> 01:27:23,800
There's gonna be a lot of great stuff that that's coming out of Dragon Con.

1701
01:27:23,800 --> 01:27:27,920
Very, very, very excited for Dragon Con and the cosplay and a little vacation.

1702
01:27:27,920 --> 01:27:30,120
So all right, well, that's going to do it.

1703
01:27:30,120 --> 01:27:33,720
We will be back live on September 8th.

1704
01:27:33,720 --> 01:27:36,160
No show next week over the Labor Day holiday.

1705
01:27:36,160 --> 01:27:41,120
Happy gaming, happy game jamming, happy conventioning, whatever it is you're doing.

1706
01:27:41,120 --> 01:27:42,120
Have a lot of fun.

1707
01:27:42,120 --> 01:27:47,860
Be safe and we'll be back to do it all again on September 8th live at Twitch TV slash VOG

1708
01:27:47,860 --> 01:27:48,860
Network.
