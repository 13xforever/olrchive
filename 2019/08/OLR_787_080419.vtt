00:00.000 --> 00:18.880
This week the Xbox's incredible TV features may have been a few years too early as demonstrated

00:18.880 --> 00:22.120
by the release of Castlevania and the In Progress Witcher and Halo series.

00:22.120 --> 00:24.800
This is just one subject on tonight's show, stay tuned for the rest of the week's gaming

00:24.800 --> 00:29.200
news starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:29.200 --> 00:37.440
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back it's another week of Orange

00:37.440 --> 00:46.080
Lounge Radio live here tonight episode number 787 for this August the 4th of 2019.

00:46.080 --> 00:49.960
My name is Rob Roberts joining you over the next few hours to talk about video games,

00:49.960 --> 00:54.200
gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle and joining me in studio as she always does sometimes

00:54.200 --> 00:55.600
on cam sometimes not.

00:55.600 --> 00:56.600
It's DarkSakura.

00:56.600 --> 00:57.600
My foot's on cam.

00:57.600 --> 00:58.600
There you go.

00:58.600 --> 00:59.600
It's DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

00:59.600 --> 01:00.600
Hi.

01:00.600 --> 01:01.600
Hi.

01:01.600 --> 01:02.600
How are you doing?

01:02.600 --> 01:03.600
I'm here.

01:03.600 --> 01:04.600
Good.

01:04.600 --> 01:05.600
Good.

01:05.600 --> 01:06.600
Glad to have you here.

01:06.600 --> 01:07.600
Yes.

01:07.600 --> 01:08.600
All right.

01:08.600 --> 01:10.360
And also joining us right over there on my other side who is on cam say hello to Tech

01:10.360 --> 01:11.360
Master Loki.

01:11.360 --> 01:12.360
Hello.

01:12.360 --> 01:13.360
Hello.

01:13.360 --> 01:14.360
I'm here.

01:14.360 --> 01:15.360
Good.

01:15.360 --> 01:17.880
We do tape live of course every Sunday night at Twitch TV slash VOG Network.

01:17.880 --> 01:18.980
That's VOG Network.

01:18.980 --> 01:23.380
The Voice of Geeks Network Sunday nights at 6 o'clock Pacific 9 o'clock Eastern usually

01:23.380 --> 01:27.620
right after the Bobby Black Wolf show, but tonight not after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

01:27.620 --> 01:29.400
Bobby was on vacation this week.

01:29.400 --> 01:32.180
He went to Gen Con, so we'll hear all about that.

01:32.180 --> 01:36.840
That's a huge board game convention out in Indianapolis if memory serves me right.

01:36.840 --> 01:40.220
It's one of those things where it's like if I had the money, the budget, and the time

01:40.220 --> 01:44.020
off work, I would love to go to that convention at some point, but sadly not in the cards

01:44.020 --> 01:45.020
for me.

01:45.020 --> 01:47.900
But it was in the cards for Bobby, so we'll hear more about that next week when he gets

01:47.900 --> 01:48.940
back.

01:48.940 --> 01:50.740
But otherwise we're still here live tonight.

01:50.740 --> 01:54.260
So we were treated to EVO, some of the finals going on there.

01:54.260 --> 01:55.620
Yeah for Tekken 7 I think.

01:55.620 --> 01:58.820
Tekken 7 we were watching a little bit here before we went live tonight.

01:58.820 --> 02:02.640
So unfortunately we didn't see who won, but I'm sure somebody will yell it out in chat

02:02.640 --> 02:06.460
because of course if you do want to participate along with the show, we appreciate all the

02:06.460 --> 02:12.220
hellos, hellos in our chat room over at Twitch TV slash VOG Network and some folks making

02:12.220 --> 02:13.280
jokes.

02:13.280 --> 02:17.200
Before we go live, if you've never joined us here at Twitch, we have just a couple minutes

02:17.200 --> 02:18.620
while we're kind of getting things ready.

02:18.620 --> 02:22.940
So we have a little picture of Mr. Smoosh that sits there while some happy music plays

02:22.940 --> 02:24.900
and some folks are making jokes about it.

02:24.900 --> 02:31.400
SG100Matt saying Mr. Smoosh pounces into Smash and Darktacilla says Super Smoosh Brothers.

02:31.400 --> 02:33.980
We actually, I guess it's okay for me to say this.

02:33.980 --> 02:38.780
We actually are going to be adding a Mr. Smoosh emote to the palette of emotes here at VOG

02:38.780 --> 02:39.780
Network.

02:39.780 --> 02:42.260
It was actually supposed to be done a few weeks ago, but we've just been kind of crazy

02:42.260 --> 02:43.260
busy with some stuff.

02:43.260 --> 02:46.740
But that will be something that we'll have in the hopper for you guys before Dragon Con.

02:46.740 --> 02:48.460
So those of you guys, you wanted it, you got it.

02:49.300 --> 02:50.300
You're going to get a Mr. Smoosh emote.

02:50.300 --> 02:51.700
It is going to be very special.

02:51.700 --> 02:55.700
It's going to be for the, we decided to make it a tier two emote sub.

02:55.700 --> 03:00.020
So it's going to be a little bit extra, extra special, but Mr. Smoosh is extra special.

03:00.020 --> 03:01.020
So yes.

03:01.020 --> 03:02.180
All right.

03:02.180 --> 03:06.320
And Questbuster clarifying, no one has won the Tekken Championship yet, but the grand

03:06.320 --> 03:08.180
final matchup is going on now.

03:08.180 --> 03:11.700
The Street Fighter 5-1 ended earlier today with Bonchan as the champ.

03:11.700 --> 03:15.700
Yes, I did see that over on Twitter because I do, I'm a big Twitter person.

03:15.940 --> 03:18.620
Anyway, we're going to get into this gaming news here.

03:18.620 --> 03:24.020
I have a big kickoff topic, some really frustrating news happening here at the top of the show.

03:24.020 --> 03:27.740
However, before we get into that, I did want to say something real quick because I know

03:27.740 --> 03:32.420
there's a lot of stuff going on in the world and specifically America that's on a lot of

03:32.420 --> 03:37.060
people's minds and specifically these back to back horrific shootings that never seem

03:37.060 --> 03:38.580
to leave the news.

03:38.580 --> 03:42.860
And although I'm not one to really want to get super political here on a show that I

03:42.860 --> 03:48.100
know people are trying to escape and get away from video games, where I do take offense,

03:48.100 --> 03:52.300
I guess, I don't know what other way to say it, is that yet again, we see talking heads

03:52.300 --> 03:57.340
going on television and trying to blame it on video games and trying to blame, you know,

03:57.340 --> 03:59.580
what these guys did on video games.

03:59.580 --> 04:02.300
I'm sorry, but that shit is tired.

04:02.300 --> 04:05.860
It's offensive and it's ignorant and it's willfully ignorant.

04:05.860 --> 04:08.900
And I, for one, I'm not going to take that shit anymore.

04:08.900 --> 04:11.480
It's not the video games fault, Congressman.

04:11.480 --> 04:20.760
It's your fault for continuing to do nothing over and over and over again about these situations.

04:20.760 --> 04:22.820
Take some goddamn responsibility.

04:22.820 --> 04:29.000
Do your fucking job and make this country a safer place already.

04:29.000 --> 04:36.440
The responsibility lies in the way these people are being raised in our failed mental health

04:36.440 --> 04:38.280
capacity.

04:38.280 --> 04:44.160
And it lies in this wave of white supremacy that's been flooding the country ever since

04:44.160 --> 04:46.320
the shithole in chief got elected.

04:46.320 --> 04:50.440
And we're not even trying to do something about like, even if it was like, OK, whatever

04:50.440 --> 04:54.020
people are, you know, really wanting, we're not even trying, like, I'm not seeing any

04:54.020 --> 04:55.680
solutions on the table about mental health.

04:55.680 --> 04:59.560
I'm not seeing any table, a solution on the table like Congress people get off the fucking

04:59.560 --> 05:01.840
TV and do your fucking job.

05:01.840 --> 05:03.640
That's so frustrating.

05:03.640 --> 05:08.840
And even so, mental health shouldn't be a scapegoat in this either, because, yeah, you

05:08.840 --> 05:10.600
don't want to put a stigma on it.

05:10.600 --> 05:11.600
I get it.

05:11.600 --> 05:19.500
But we need to make bigots afraid and we need to make them pay for what they do.

05:19.500 --> 05:24.240
And I'm sorry they took this guy in Ohio alive because guess what?

05:24.240 --> 05:25.300
White boy.

05:25.300 --> 05:28.000
It is domestic terrorism.

05:28.000 --> 05:29.760
Call it what it is.

05:29.760 --> 05:31.920
Video games had jack shit to do with this.

05:31.920 --> 05:32.920
Hitler was a painter.

05:32.920 --> 05:35.560
Are we blaming painters for World War Two?

05:35.560 --> 05:37.120
And that's why you mention it.

05:37.120 --> 05:40.440
Well, no, but like, you know, as a vegetarian or vegetarians to blame.

05:40.440 --> 05:45.200
Well, now that you mean well, you know, all that aside, you know, there's there's you

05:45.200 --> 05:49.040
know, since we mentioned Evo at the top of the show, there's thousands and thousands

05:49.040 --> 05:53.500
of gamers at Evo right now, which I would consider like a positive thing.

05:53.500 --> 05:54.880
They're having fun.

05:54.880 --> 05:55.880
It's sports.

05:55.880 --> 05:56.880
It's a great thing.

05:56.880 --> 06:00.360
Video games can be a friendly competition and it's uplifting.

06:00.360 --> 06:05.880
And it's just I am sick of video games being the goddamn scapegoat, knock it off, like

06:05.880 --> 06:07.720
get your head out of your butt.

06:07.720 --> 06:11.100
I'm just I'm not going to take it anymore as a gamer.

06:11.100 --> 06:12.720
And I don't think any of us should.

06:12.720 --> 06:14.440
This is not our fault.

06:14.440 --> 06:18.360
Anyway, sorry, I'll get off the soapbox for now.

06:18.360 --> 06:21.280
But it would have really bugged me if I didn't say anything about it at all.

06:21.280 --> 06:25.840
But I know people do want to listen to this show and play video games to sometimes escape

06:25.840 --> 06:26.840
the real world.

06:26.840 --> 06:30.960
Since we are talking about mental health and trying to stay in a good state of mind,

06:30.960 --> 06:34.000
despite everything that's going on, I don't think there's really anything wrong with that.

06:34.000 --> 06:38.040
You know, sometimes I know people say you shouldn't plug your ears, go la la la and

06:38.040 --> 06:39.320
play video games.

06:39.320 --> 06:42.960
But sometimes I realize like if it's like what you have to do for your own sanity, then

06:42.960 --> 06:44.320
it's what you have to do.

06:44.320 --> 06:48.080
So you know, be just stay informed.

06:48.080 --> 06:50.760
But if you need a break, I don't blame you.

06:50.760 --> 06:52.060
Anyway, let's move on.

06:52.060 --> 06:53.060
Let's get into some gaming news.

06:53.060 --> 06:55.380
I wish I had a happier story to start us off.

06:55.380 --> 06:58.700
But unfortunately, we have kind of a frustrating story starting us off.

06:58.700 --> 07:02.180
It's just a different type, a completely different type of frustrating story, starting us off

07:02.180 --> 07:03.340
at the top of the show.

07:03.340 --> 07:07.600
And this is something that very well could have affected all of us in the room.

07:07.600 --> 07:12.660
Because all of us here in the room have prior attended E3 at one point or another as media.

07:12.660 --> 07:17.540
You know, some years we went as I think general or maybe as you and as like professional or

07:17.540 --> 07:20.460
industry a couple years when you were working with.

07:20.460 --> 07:23.720
But at one point, at least all of us have gone as media.

07:23.720 --> 07:28.620
And unfortunately, for some peers and some people we all here in this room know, some

07:28.620 --> 07:34.940
of our media friends have been impacted by a very severe leak that happened with E3 data.

07:34.940 --> 07:39.100
So what happened, of course, the ESA or the Entertainment Software Association, who puts

07:39.100 --> 07:42.840
on E3, they hand out hundreds of press badges every year.

07:42.840 --> 07:43.840
We know this.

07:43.840 --> 07:45.220
They hand a lot of folks to press.

07:45.220 --> 07:48.860
We've sometimes complained about how hard the process has gotten in recent years.

07:48.860 --> 07:52.580
As things have shifted from, you know, maybe like indie press and podcasts and things

07:52.580 --> 07:57.900
that we do to more like the big social media influencers, the YouTubers, the Twitchers,

07:57.900 --> 08:01.080
the mixers, which we'll get into later, and all of that.

08:01.080 --> 08:06.820
So what this also means is that once you are registered for E3 as press, they have your

08:06.820 --> 08:10.380
name, they have your phone number, they have your address and so forth.

08:10.380 --> 08:16.380
And while a lot of people in the industry might have like a business, like retail estate,

08:16.380 --> 08:20.020
meaning like a business place of employment that they can put as their address, like maybe

08:20.020 --> 08:25.860
they work out of an office in downtown San Francisco or, you know, wherever they're located.

08:25.860 --> 08:29.440
Not everybody, you know, especially when it comes to individual influencers, when it comes

08:29.440 --> 08:34.020
to the more independent homegrown press, we use, and I know we've used in the past, our

08:34.020 --> 08:37.760
home addresses and our home phone numbers because, you know, we're running a business

08:37.760 --> 08:40.580
in our spare time, basically.

08:40.580 --> 08:45.000
So the ESA keeps track of all this information.

08:45.000 --> 08:49.680
They have a reason for doing it because they want to make sure that they're able to give

08:49.680 --> 08:53.880
this information to gaming companies, that gaming companies can contact you to try to

08:53.880 --> 08:56.280
schedule appointments to see games.

08:56.280 --> 09:00.440
And you know, again, we've gone to E3's meeting before, we've received these emails, we've

09:00.440 --> 09:04.180
responded and taken the bait sometimes to see different things at E3.

09:04.180 --> 09:08.960
That's how we have brought you guys in the past, the way past we were going to E3 regularly,

09:08.960 --> 09:14.080
some of the stories and hands-ons and things that we have gotten in the past at E3.

09:14.080 --> 09:18.240
Unfortunately this year, it's gone really, really bad.

09:18.240 --> 09:24.600
A YouTuber actually noticed on the ESA website that there was a button that would allow you

09:24.600 --> 09:31.480
to get a spreadsheet on the site that you could download all of the media information.

09:31.480 --> 09:35.280
I believe, and I'm going to be honest, maybe somebody in chat wants to clarify if they

09:35.280 --> 09:41.000
know, I believe it was something where you kind of had to like log in as a vendor or

09:41.000 --> 09:44.860
as a participant in E3 to see the page.

09:44.860 --> 09:49.240
But once you logged in to see the page, the spreadsheet wasn't locked.

09:49.240 --> 09:53.200
So if you had the link to get to that spreadsheet, which of course, you know, when this came

09:53.200 --> 09:57.760
out, it started spreading around the internet in not so great circles.

09:57.760 --> 10:02.000
As long as you had a link to the spreadsheet, it was not password protected or behind some

10:02.000 --> 10:03.960
type of security or anything like that.

10:03.960 --> 10:07.740
Which is actually a major breach of privacy law.

10:07.740 --> 10:11.640
Especially now in Europe, you know, Europe has very strict internet laws when it comes

10:11.640 --> 10:12.640
to things like that.

10:12.640 --> 10:13.640
Yeah, absolutely.

10:13.640 --> 10:14.640
This is a breach of law.

10:14.640 --> 10:19.860
And unfortunately, you know, the gross thing about the world we live in is that some people

10:19.860 --> 10:26.220
take their frustrations out on games that are or aren't made or are well received or

10:26.220 --> 10:27.580
not so well received.

10:27.580 --> 10:30.860
They take out those frustrations on journalists.

10:30.860 --> 10:35.100
And I'm sorry, but combine it with some of the things and the really gross topics we

10:35.100 --> 10:37.540
were talking about just a few moments ago.

10:37.540 --> 10:42.700
I know a lot of journalist friends that are kind of like somewhere in that realm between

10:42.700 --> 10:46.700
really fucking annoyed and really fucking scared at what just happened.

10:46.700 --> 10:48.060
Because y'all know it.

10:48.060 --> 10:51.460
It happens on Twitch streams and that stuff all the time where that swatting bullshit

10:51.460 --> 10:56.100
happens, you know, because somebody thinks it's funny when it's not funny.

10:56.100 --> 11:02.660
And now they have like the addresses and telephone numbers of many big content creators and press

11:02.660 --> 11:05.160
people and so forth to be able to do that.

11:05.160 --> 11:06.160
It's scary.

11:06.160 --> 11:07.160
It's shocking.

11:07.160 --> 11:12.180
And it's fucking gross that the ESA ever allowed this to happen.

11:12.180 --> 11:14.620
This blows my mind.

11:14.620 --> 11:20.480
They're putting on one of the biggest tech shows in the industry.

11:20.480 --> 11:26.180
And this spreadsheet was out there for anyone to grab without a, if they just had the link,

11:26.180 --> 11:31.700
without a password, without some type of protection or encryption.

11:31.700 --> 11:33.780
What the fuck?

11:33.780 --> 11:40.280
On top of that, giving this information to any kind of vendor at all, just even making

11:40.280 --> 11:49.980
it remotely available for use is by itself detestable.

11:49.980 --> 11:58.700
You know, then having it be so poorly protected is just more like, let me pour some acid in

11:58.700 --> 12:00.300
that wound.

12:00.300 --> 12:03.880
Tiger Claw in chat with a comment that I think ought to be addressed because this is a logical

12:03.880 --> 12:08.460
place where my brain goes about this, you know, because we're thinking about, or at

12:08.460 --> 12:12.660
least I'm thinking about, oh, it's only a matter of time for the class action lawsuit.

12:12.660 --> 12:14.980
It is only a matter of time for the class action lawsuit.

12:14.980 --> 12:18.980
And this time I don't, I don't think it's a frivolous thing.

12:18.980 --> 12:19.980
It is.

12:19.980 --> 12:22.920
This is, if there's a class action lawsuit on this, that is not a frivolous lawsuit.

12:22.920 --> 12:26.020
That is, that is holding the ESA accountable for what they did.

12:26.020 --> 12:30.180
But the Tiger Claw in chat over Twitch TV slash VOG network with a comment that I think

12:30.180 --> 12:35.460
a lot of us are thinking, this is going to have a profound effect for E3 2020.

12:35.460 --> 12:39.360
Some of those gaming journalists will be hesitant on putting their info when registering for

12:39.360 --> 12:41.540
E3 again.

12:41.540 --> 12:45.580
There's already been a lot of questions in the air about the relevance of E3 and do we

12:45.580 --> 12:47.400
need E3?

12:47.400 --> 12:53.340
And now just add this onto that where now journalists are going to give this a second

12:53.340 --> 12:55.860
thought about if they should even register.

12:55.860 --> 13:00.460
Now I'm sure there'll be promises from the ESA about, you know, that they'll, they'll

13:00.460 --> 13:05.620
put, and they did put out a statement, let me read the statement from the ESA, uh, ESA

13:05.620 --> 13:09.260
was made aware of a website vulnerability that led to the contact list of registered

13:09.260 --> 13:12.340
journalists attending E3 being made public.

13:12.340 --> 13:16.300
Once notified, we immediately took steps to protect that data and shut down the site,

13:16.300 --> 13:17.720
which is no longer available.

13:17.720 --> 13:21.940
We regret this occurrence and have measures in place to ensure it will not occur again.

13:21.940 --> 13:25.140
Wait, made aware that they designed the site.

13:25.500 --> 13:28.900
Well, we didn't know what was on our site or how it was formatted or anything like that.

13:30.740 --> 13:33.420
No, you can't claim that kind of negligence.

13:33.420 --> 13:35.700
And a website vulnerability.

13:35.700 --> 13:37.060
It was not a vulnerability.

13:37.060 --> 13:41.060
You just, you, you were stupid and didn't lock the door.

13:41.300 --> 13:46.500
Yeah, it was a poor choice, as, as the great and wonderful and pure Tatiana once said,

13:47.020 --> 13:51.820
choices. And that's what went into that website design, choices.

13:52.820 --> 13:54.860
Uh, comments from chat.

13:54.860 --> 14:00.780
SSU100Matt says the gaming community, while great, such as VOG, can be vile sometimes.

14:00.780 --> 14:04.060
Attacking devs, reviewers, et cetera, because they do not agree with them.

14:04.060 --> 14:09.020
You know, and I really want to truly believe that that is a case of the way too vocal minority.

14:09.020 --> 14:12.060
I think most gamers are pretty cool.

14:12.060 --> 14:16.300
You know, again, look at Evo, look at, you know, some of the like positive stuff going on in gaming.

14:16.300 --> 14:17.900
There's a lot of positive things to talk about.

14:17.900 --> 14:20.380
Unfortunately, there's a lot of shit bags that bring it down for the rest of us.

14:20.380 --> 14:20.980
We all know that.

14:21.540 --> 14:27.060
Um, Questbuster says, I've seen some replies that mentioned that the ESA was told of the

14:27.060 --> 14:29.940
vulnerability a month ago and did nothing.

14:29.940 --> 14:30.180
Yeah.

14:30.180 --> 14:33.620
That was one of the first replies I got to my tweet because I tweeted about this in the

14:33.620 --> 14:34.820
middle of the night, the other night.

14:34.820 --> 14:37.700
And that was one of the first replies I got was that they've known this for a while and

14:37.700 --> 14:41.780
didn't do anything, which is just, you know, again, I don't know what all the facts are

14:41.780 --> 14:48.100
there yet, but if that is proven to be true, then that, I mean, they're, the ESA is about

14:48.180 --> 14:50.340
to have a gigantic court battle on their hands.

14:50.340 --> 14:55.780
And especially if names and addresses of folks in Europe were a part of that, which I imagine

14:55.780 --> 14:57.380
it was, I didn't look at the list.

14:57.380 --> 14:58.500
I don't want to look at the list.

14:58.500 --> 15:03.060
I don't want to even encourage anybody to look for this list because it's not your fucking

15:03.060 --> 15:07.620
business, but assuming that there are, you know, media folks in Europe that were probably

15:07.620 --> 15:11.140
on that list, um, they're going to have a hell of a battle on their hands with this

15:11.140 --> 15:12.020
new Europe law.

15:12.740 --> 15:18.020
So I, and could that have a profound effect on E3?

15:18.740 --> 15:26.180
I, I seem to recall, correct me if I'm wrong chatters, co-hosts, I seem to recall just

15:26.180 --> 15:30.660
a couple months ago, there was a lot of questions and a lot of issues about the guy that's

15:30.660 --> 15:31.940
running the ESA right now.

15:31.940 --> 15:35.540
Wasn't that a thing that was going around in the news about the guy that's running it

15:35.540 --> 15:38.100
and some of his issues that are happening right now?

15:38.100 --> 15:41.700
I, this, this guy, this guy's going to pay for it with his job.

15:42.900 --> 15:44.100
Watch, that's my prediction.

15:44.100 --> 15:46.260
This guy's going to have to answer for it with his job.

15:46.260 --> 15:46.820
He has to.

15:47.700 --> 15:53.620
Anyway, um, let's see, uh, Questbuster says the dump looks like it was just pulled straight

15:53.620 --> 15:57.700
from registration and not scrubbed, which is why the addresses were there likely for

15:57.700 --> 15:58.820
badge mailings.

15:58.820 --> 16:03.220
Uh, Metal Mayhem says scary thought given the social and political situation that's

16:03.220 --> 16:06.660
been enabled by the Cheeto in chief, any of the journalists that happen to be not wide

16:06.660 --> 16:08.580
or straight could be targeted, which is frightening.

16:08.580 --> 16:11.060
Uh, yeah, they, thank you for getting it.

16:11.380 --> 16:14.020
Like, thank you as a white straight guy for getting it.

16:14.020 --> 16:16.260
Like, it is very scary.

16:16.260 --> 16:20.900
And that's why I'm like, thank God that I didn't go to E3 this year.

16:20.900 --> 16:25.700
And I honestly, in my gut, I'm like, were the previous year's spreadsheets up there?

16:25.700 --> 16:26.740
Cause I'm a little worried.

16:29.620 --> 16:30.900
Uh, let's see.

16:30.900 --> 16:35.540
Questbuster says, yeah, Bobby went through the tumult at the ESA a few episodes ago.

16:35.540 --> 16:36.980
I thought that was a thing.

16:36.980 --> 16:39.460
And Pixel Pockets points out they don't mail press badges.

16:39.460 --> 16:41.300
You have to pick them up at the convention center.

16:41.300 --> 16:41.940
That's right.

16:41.940 --> 16:43.220
I do remember this being a thing.

16:43.220 --> 16:46.100
Oh God, Pixel Pockets, are you, are you impacted by this?

16:46.100 --> 16:48.100
Well, did you go to E3 this year as media?

16:48.100 --> 16:52.100
If so, I'm like, I don't want to put you on the spot, but I would really love to know

16:52.100 --> 16:52.660
your thoughts.

16:52.660 --> 16:54.900
I know you have gone to some stuff as media before.

16:54.900 --> 16:55.700
Okay.

16:55.700 --> 16:56.820
Uh, Pixel Pockets clarifies.

16:56.820 --> 16:58.660
I did not go to E3 this year.

16:58.660 --> 17:00.740
Fortunately, many of my friends did go.

17:00.740 --> 17:01.860
Yeah, many of mine did too.

17:01.860 --> 17:04.100
I know other indie podcasters that were there.

17:04.100 --> 17:08.500
I have other industry friends that went and I, I feel for them.

17:08.500 --> 17:11.140
I'm like, what can I do but be fucking mad?

17:11.140 --> 17:13.220
Like, there's just like, what can I do?

17:14.820 --> 17:16.100
What can any of us do?

17:16.100 --> 17:17.220
It's, it's scary.

17:17.220 --> 17:18.260
It's a scary thought.

17:18.260 --> 17:23.140
I think a lot of the tips and things that are going around online, like ensure you have

17:23.140 --> 17:25.060
two-factor authentication.

17:25.060 --> 17:28.820
You might want to change your phone number if you were using your personal phone number.

17:28.820 --> 17:30.820
Take some precautions in that regard.

17:30.820 --> 17:32.420
I think that's all very good advice.

17:32.420 --> 17:36.580
I think two-factor authentication, if you aren't a journalist, is a great thing to have

17:36.580 --> 17:40.660
on like you, you really, you really, really should have it on like your email and your

17:40.660 --> 17:41.460
banking.

17:41.460 --> 17:44.180
If nothing else, everything comes back to your email.

17:44.180 --> 17:46.100
You can password reset everything with your email.

17:46.100 --> 17:48.660
Have your two-factor auth on your email, please.

17:48.660 --> 17:51.220
And your banking is probably pretty important too.

17:51.220 --> 17:56.740
So if nothing else, I mean, I have TF, 2FA or whatever you call on everything, but I

17:56.740 --> 17:58.980
mean, if nothing else, put it on those things.

17:58.980 --> 18:03.380
You can't, you can buy, and speaking of gaming, you can do it on PlayStation Network.

18:03.380 --> 18:04.260
You can do it on Microsoft.

18:04.260 --> 18:06.420
They pretty much force you with the PlayStation Network.

18:06.420 --> 18:07.620
I think they do.

18:07.620 --> 18:09.940
Uh, I don't remember if Nintendo has it.

18:09.940 --> 18:10.740
I don't think they do.

18:13.220 --> 18:14.420
I don't think so.

18:14.420 --> 18:14.980
Go ahead.

18:14.980 --> 18:19.380
By the way, just going back to the earlier thing before, before I forget, cause actually,

18:19.380 --> 18:22.420
um, AOC made a comment about the video game thing.

18:23.060 --> 18:23.620
Oh, good.

18:23.620 --> 18:24.020
Yeah.

18:24.020 --> 18:25.300
I I'd be curious about that.

18:25.300 --> 18:30.420
I know she's a polarizing people for some, but she's, she's been, she goes on to video

18:30.420 --> 18:31.700
game streams, right?

18:31.700 --> 18:32.740
Well, this is her tweet.

18:33.380 --> 18:36.020
Video games aren't causing mass shootings.

18:36.020 --> 18:41.220
White supremacy is sadly the GOP refused to acknowledge that because their strategy relies

18:41.220 --> 18:43.220
on rallying a white supremacist base.

18:43.220 --> 18:48.100
That's why the president has stadiums of people chanting, send her back and targets Congress

18:48.100 --> 18:48.900
members of color.

18:51.460 --> 18:52.660
I will mic drop.

18:52.660 --> 18:55.780
Yeah, I, there's, there's nothing to say to follow that.

18:55.780 --> 18:56.660
There's nothing to say.

18:57.300 --> 18:58.260
Um, let's see.

18:58.820 --> 19:02.500
Uh, anyway, um, I'm not sure what else to say about this.

19:03.300 --> 19:04.420
It's so frustrating.

19:04.420 --> 19:08.820
And again, it's like, I feel for my friends and I'm like, how, how can I help you?

19:08.820 --> 19:11.460
If you need to stay at my place, you can stay at my place.

19:11.460 --> 19:12.820
Like it's like one of those, like, I don't know.

19:12.820 --> 19:18.340
I hope it doesn't get that bad, but I mean, it's just like now that's out there and it's

19:18.340 --> 19:18.980
on the internet.

19:18.980 --> 19:24.500
And when the next dippy thing happens where they decide to target gaming journalists for

19:24.500 --> 19:32.020
some bad opinion or something that they don't agree with, it's just like, I'm so upset.

19:32.100 --> 19:33.380
I'm so upset.

19:33.380 --> 19:37.220
And the ESA, this statement they put out, it's not good enough.

19:37.220 --> 19:40.740
And I think a lot of gamers need to make the ESA aware.

19:40.740 --> 19:45.060
I guess I could say this, you know, I know we don't have a gigantic fan base and listener

19:45.060 --> 19:45.860
base and so forth.

19:45.860 --> 19:49.460
We got, we got a little something here and we all know friends that are gamers as well.

19:49.460 --> 19:55.460
And I think, I think we need to voice to the ESA that they need to do better.

19:55.460 --> 19:58.900
This is not a sufficient apology, what they've put out here.

19:58.900 --> 20:00.340
This is not sufficient.

20:00.340 --> 20:04.900
You know, what are they going to do to help protect these people that they've now exposed?

20:05.860 --> 20:07.860
What are detail?

20:07.860 --> 20:11.220
What are the steps they're going to take to make sure this doesn't happen again?

20:11.220 --> 20:15.300
How are they going to, to the best of their ability, stop the spread of this spreadsheet

20:15.300 --> 20:16.180
around further?

20:16.820 --> 20:18.580
We deserve details.

20:18.580 --> 20:22.420
We deserve better answers from a tech company.

20:22.420 --> 20:25.380
Jesus Christ, that's the most frustrating thing about this whole thing.

20:25.380 --> 20:27.860
Like you're in technology and you let this happen.

20:28.500 --> 20:28.900
Barf.

20:30.420 --> 20:33.780
Sia Tabiri says, would having a PO box help protect?

20:33.780 --> 20:38.100
Do registrations for press badges permit you to list those instead of physical addresses?

20:38.100 --> 20:41.860
And Pixel Pacas follows that up with, yes, you can list a PO box address.

20:43.140 --> 20:46.900
Technically, VOG network has that type of setup.

20:46.900 --> 20:52.020
So if we had registered, we would have been able to use that or whatever, but it doesn't

20:52.020 --> 20:57.140
like the fact that, oh, maybe it wouldn't have been as bad for us, does not negate

20:57.140 --> 21:02.260
the severity of the crime because like there have been years past.

21:02.260 --> 21:05.860
Um, I think with the first E3 was when you and I live together, wasn't it?

21:05.860 --> 21:08.340
Loki, the first time we went to E3, you and I were still living together.

21:08.340 --> 21:08.900
I think so.

21:08.900 --> 21:08.980
Yeah.

21:08.980 --> 21:14.900
So I think we put our address on the, the form and on the cards and everything is we

21:14.900 --> 21:16.980
didn't like, OLR wasn't registered as a business.

21:16.980 --> 21:18.420
Then we weren't with all games.

21:18.420 --> 21:20.100
We weren't with a VOG at the time.

21:20.100 --> 21:21.780
It was, it was back in the life 365 years.

21:23.940 --> 21:24.420
Yeah.

21:24.740 --> 21:29.860
Remember later on, I think we, you know, we had other ways to do it, but that first year.

21:29.860 --> 21:30.360
Yeah.

21:30.660 --> 21:33.140
So, uh, uh, yeah.

21:33.140 --> 21:37.380
Pixel pocket says there was a big level of trust from press to the ESA.

21:37.380 --> 21:39.220
And now that trust is demolished.

21:39.220 --> 21:43.140
I wonder if this is going to cause all media to sign up in person.

21:44.180 --> 21:48.340
I don't know if that really would have prevented it, but if media had signed up in person,

21:48.340 --> 21:51.300
then they wouldn't have been on a spreadsheet to go out to folks.

21:51.300 --> 21:54.180
Well, maybe they would have after the fact, I don't want to speak out of turn,

21:54.180 --> 21:57.700
but I would think it's going to cause a lot more people to just work more directly with

21:57.700 --> 21:59.620
game companies and not go through the ESA.

22:00.180 --> 22:00.580
I don't know.

22:02.020 --> 22:02.820
We'll see what happens.

22:03.460 --> 22:07.860
Uh, anyway, quest Buster says a lot of streamers also use one to deal with their fans and go

22:07.860 --> 22:10.580
to a lot of links to avoid saying anything too personal.

22:10.580 --> 22:14.500
But the sheet essentially says exactly who these YouTube and streamers are, who went.

22:14.500 --> 22:14.740
Yeah.

22:14.740 --> 22:18.500
And it's doing under Matt says, granted, you wouldn't have to use your address, but you'd

22:18.500 --> 22:19.540
have to use your real name.

22:19.540 --> 22:21.220
I imagine you're right.

22:21.220 --> 22:23.540
If I register for a pass, it would have been under my real name.

22:23.540 --> 22:27.140
I think y'all know that no parent is cruel enough to name their kid, Rob Roberts.

22:27.140 --> 22:28.260
It's a stage name.

22:28.260 --> 22:31.620
And you know, I, that, that's, that's who I am on the internet.

22:31.620 --> 22:33.060
That's my online identity.

22:33.060 --> 22:35.060
When I'm at my day job, I have a different name.

22:35.060 --> 22:38.020
I have the one I was born with, so it's, it's different.

22:38.020 --> 22:40.660
And it's my right to keep those kinds of two lives separate.

22:40.660 --> 22:41.620
And that name is Mr.

22:41.620 --> 22:42.020
Rob.

22:42.020 --> 22:42.900
That's Mr.

22:42.900 --> 22:43.220
Mr.

22:43.220 --> 22:43.940
Smoosh's dad.

22:43.940 --> 22:45.380
That's my, that's my name.

22:45.380 --> 22:46.100
Yeah.

22:46.100 --> 22:50.500
So anyway, actually it's funny because funny enough, you say that I do teach classes.

22:50.580 --> 22:54.420
I'm a corporate trainer and I do let folks in class call me Mr.

22:54.420 --> 22:55.060
Rob.

22:55.060 --> 22:58.500
So, cause my real last name gets butchered a lot.

22:58.500 --> 22:59.620
That's all I'll say about that.

22:59.620 --> 23:01.300
So I let folks call me Mr.

23:01.300 --> 23:01.540
Rob.

23:02.420 --> 23:07.140
Anyway, very, very, very frustrating news and not the most fun thing to start off the

23:07.140 --> 23:07.700
show with.

23:07.700 --> 23:11.700
But, uh, you know, we need to hold the ESA accountable for this and I hope next week

23:11.700 --> 23:15.060
we have more to say and they have more to say on this whole issue.

23:15.060 --> 23:16.420
So let's move on.

23:16.420 --> 23:18.820
Let's, let's get into like some happier gaming news.

23:18.820 --> 23:21.380
I feel like this whole beginning of the show has been a downer.

23:21.380 --> 23:24.900
So let's talk about some happier news, hopefully in your gaming week and some fun

23:24.900 --> 23:26.500
games that you've been playing this week.

23:26.500 --> 23:27.060
Uh, dark soccer.

23:27.060 --> 23:27.620
We'll start with you.

23:27.620 --> 23:28.740
How was your gaming week?

23:28.740 --> 23:30.340
Other than the phone stuff?

23:30.340 --> 23:37.060
I was just playing Sims for, um, really just building houses and feeling crummy.

23:38.180 --> 23:40.340
No, no elaborate death traps in the Sims.

23:40.900 --> 23:42.900
No, because you can't drown them in.

23:42.900 --> 23:44.500
Oh, I just had an idea.

23:45.380 --> 23:52.340
What if I build walls around the pool and they can't climb out of the, cause they can

23:52.340 --> 23:54.260
climb out of the pool without the ladder now.

23:54.260 --> 23:56.340
Oh, that was an upgrade in Sims 4.

23:56.900 --> 24:05.700
So what if I put stoves all around the, um, all around the pool.

24:06.980 --> 24:08.660
What if I put the stove in the pool?

24:08.660 --> 24:10.500
Why can't you just throw a toaster in the pool?

24:10.500 --> 24:11.460
Cause that doesn't work.

24:11.780 --> 24:16.020
Oh, but I could put stoves around it and then the walls.

24:16.020 --> 24:20.420
And so there'd actually be something blocking the edge of the, of the,

24:20.420 --> 24:21.700
just lock them in walls.

24:21.700 --> 24:22.740
Just wall them in.

24:23.300 --> 24:27.220
No, I don't want to have my other Sims live in a house filled with pee.

24:27.220 --> 24:31.620
Although I am trying to lock a Sim in there cause I need a ghost in one of my houses I'm

24:31.620 --> 24:32.260
designing.

24:32.260 --> 24:35.860
Have you, have you thought about just having somebody that's like dead in the walls and

24:35.860 --> 24:39.220
then like having a suburban family living in that house where there's like a body?

24:39.220 --> 24:40.180
That's what I need to do.

24:40.180 --> 24:40.900
Okay.

24:40.900 --> 24:45.140
No, but I need this ghost to look a certain way.

24:45.140 --> 24:50.900
So I have to design the ghost and then leave the ghost in the wall and then have its body

24:50.900 --> 24:53.540
there to haunt the other people in the house.

24:53.540 --> 24:54.740
Happy Halloween, everybody.

24:55.620 --> 24:57.060
This is Halloween.

24:57.060 --> 24:58.340
This is Halloween.

24:59.140 --> 24:59.940
All right.

24:59.940 --> 25:01.940
Glad to know some things never change with the Sims.

25:02.580 --> 25:03.060
All right.

25:03.060 --> 25:04.500
Anyway, uh, we'll move on.

25:04.500 --> 25:05.860
Loki, how was your gaming week?

25:05.860 --> 25:07.460
I didn't really play anything.

25:07.460 --> 25:09.620
Um, I did play laser tag again.

25:09.620 --> 25:12.500
Um, I did feel more of that actually.

25:12.500 --> 25:14.820
And it actually came out decent.

25:14.820 --> 25:16.260
Are they starting to recognize you now?

25:16.820 --> 25:18.260
Yeah, they should.

25:18.260 --> 25:21.700
I mean, um, they're not very organized though.

25:21.700 --> 25:26.180
Like I like was asking today about their membership thing and they're like, I don't know.

25:26.180 --> 25:27.140
They'll ask the owner.

25:27.780 --> 25:29.380
And so the owner was there today.

25:29.380 --> 25:34.420
And so I asked him and he's like, he had to like think about it for a sec.

25:34.420 --> 25:37.460
And then they pulled out this binder and like, it's like flipping through it.

25:37.460 --> 25:40.980
And he's like, I don't know where the pamphlet is, but he's going to email it to me.

25:41.620 --> 25:44.340
And I don't even know, like, wow, way to make sales.

25:44.340 --> 25:44.660
I know.

25:44.660 --> 25:50.740
It's like, it's like, uh, you have, like, if you don't know what the membership thing

25:50.740 --> 25:56.660
is about, maybe don't put a page dedicated to it on your fucking website.

25:56.660 --> 25:59.140
You know, that's just common sense.

25:59.140 --> 26:03.860
I would think like it says, it literally says, come ask us about the membership.

26:03.860 --> 26:06.020
So I come ask them every time I'm there.

26:06.020 --> 26:08.420
And they're like, I don't fucking know what you're talking about.

26:09.140 --> 26:12.500
And so like, I'm just, what the fuck?

26:12.500 --> 26:13.540
I don't understand.

26:14.180 --> 26:19.060
It's so whatever it is what it is, but I'm just curious.

26:19.060 --> 26:24.260
Like, I just like what, cause I know you can like the very least we can get our names logged

26:24.260 --> 26:24.500
in.

26:24.500 --> 26:28.900
And so instead of using the gun names, because then like, you know, cues are, which use like

26:28.900 --> 26:33.380
numbers and colors, um, this, the each gun has like a name to it.

26:33.380 --> 26:37.620
So there's actually agent name, there's, there's actually a Loki gun there, but it

26:37.620 --> 26:38.100
sucks.

26:38.100 --> 26:38.980
So I don't play it.

26:39.620 --> 26:44.980
But there's, you know, they have like Thor and racer and like all sorts of weird names,

26:44.980 --> 26:49.140
but so if you scan it, can you be Loki, even though there's already a Loki?

26:50.020 --> 26:52.180
Um, I'm probably not going to be Loki.

26:52.180 --> 26:54.260
I'll just be Loki OLR probably.

26:54.260 --> 26:54.500
Okay.

26:55.220 --> 26:58.980
You have a different, like, do you have a different gun is your gun personality?

26:58.980 --> 27:00.100
You're like gun personality.

27:00.100 --> 27:03.300
Is that different from, you know, your, your online video game personality?

27:03.300 --> 27:04.500
Maybe you have a different, all the same.

27:04.500 --> 27:04.900
Okay.

27:04.900 --> 27:10.500
Um, so yeah, I would probably do something like that and I don't know, but like, I like

27:10.500 --> 27:15.300
today we did three hours and that's a bit much and I'm, you know, talking with the kids

27:15.300 --> 27:18.980
and like, you know, maybe we should just take a break from this next week cause we've been

27:18.980 --> 27:21.060
there an awful lot and it's expensive.

27:21.060 --> 27:23.540
So, uh, may just kind of cut back on that.

27:24.100 --> 27:31.300
Um, I had the good intention of publishing what I had of it's time to car.

27:32.580 --> 27:38.820
Unfortunately, when I moved to this laptop, apparently back in 2017, the backups I had

27:39.460 --> 27:43.620
were months old from the current one.

27:43.620 --> 27:46.260
I'm missing an entire level in it and they're broken.

27:46.820 --> 27:47.860
They are missing things.

27:47.860 --> 27:53.460
I can restore some of them that have the first three levels in it, but it's just not

27:53.460 --> 27:53.860
the same.

27:53.860 --> 27:59.540
That last level was just fucking weird in that really kind of encapsulated the whole

27:59.540 --> 27:59.940
thing.

27:59.940 --> 28:02.580
So I'm probably not going to end up doing that.

28:02.580 --> 28:08.500
Although ironically, I've been asked, um, by the owner of the place that we go to for

28:08.500 --> 28:13.780
my son's coding class to teach a unity class that is silly.

28:13.780 --> 28:15.380
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

28:15.380 --> 28:16.660
Can you say that again?

28:16.660 --> 28:17.060
Yes.

28:17.060 --> 28:23.300
You, the creator of zero games in unity have now been asked to teach a unity class.

28:23.700 --> 28:24.900
She'll okay.

28:24.900 --> 28:28.740
Loki's going to be teaching children about a saw.

28:28.740 --> 28:31.700
I think he's never really used to completion.

28:31.700 --> 28:33.140
Is that, is that, am I understanding this?

28:33.140 --> 28:34.420
I've used it enough, but.

28:37.460 --> 28:37.860
All right.

28:37.860 --> 28:41.540
That's like, that is like me coaching football, but all right, go off.

28:44.340 --> 28:47.300
So I I've, I've, I've played Tecmo bowl.

28:47.300 --> 28:49.540
I understand the rules of football.

28:49.540 --> 28:50.040
Exactly.

28:50.520 --> 28:53.080
It's, I don't think it's supposed to be like anything in depth.

28:53.080 --> 28:57.720
It's supposed to be just a few classes, not necessarily like this is a full in-depth

28:57.720 --> 28:58.840
course of like unity.

28:58.840 --> 29:00.840
You're going to learn all about it and everything.

29:00.840 --> 29:05.240
It's more of just like, we're going to make a quick game, a project or whatever.

29:05.240 --> 29:05.880
And then that's it.

29:05.880 --> 29:06.920
Get your feet wet.

29:06.920 --> 29:12.040
And because really when they get into unity, it's, it's like several belts later.

29:12.040 --> 29:17.800
Like most of the kids are on just like JavaScript and like intermediate JavaScript.

29:17.800 --> 29:23.080
And then like to get to unity is probably a couple of years away from them.

29:23.800 --> 29:25.880
So it's just going to be like kind of a crash course.

29:25.880 --> 29:28.280
And like, here's what you're doing in JavaScript.

29:28.280 --> 29:32.280
Here's what C-sharp is, you know, here's how you use unity.

29:32.280 --> 29:38.280
We'll set you up with something that, you know, you can build some stuff for like different

29:38.920 --> 29:43.800
gameplay aspects and then, you know, run with it and you can rearrange stuff to build your

29:43.800 --> 29:44.760
own levels or something.

29:44.760 --> 29:46.200
Symbol is the plan.

29:46.200 --> 29:46.700
Okay.

29:47.500 --> 29:52.780
I, I think that, no, I completely understand your hesitation, which was also my hesitation

29:52.780 --> 29:59.420
because it was like, yes, I'm interested, but I haven't really created anything with it.

29:59.420 --> 30:00.940
I don't have a lot of formal training.

30:00.940 --> 30:03.100
Finally light the fire under your ass to finish.

30:03.100 --> 30:07.980
I guess something you can do with your kid, you know, I guess, but yeah, it would be more

30:07.980 --> 30:11.020
targeted towards like older kids, like 12 and up type things.

30:11.020 --> 30:14.220
So, um, well, your oldest just turned nine, right?

30:14.220 --> 30:15.420
Yeah, he's getting there.

30:15.420 --> 30:17.980
So it would be happy birthday.

30:17.980 --> 30:18.620
Yeah.

30:18.620 --> 30:19.980
It'd be interesting.

30:19.980 --> 30:23.660
I I'm looking forward to trying that when that's going to happen.

30:24.780 --> 30:25.340
All right.

30:25.340 --> 30:31.100
But I have to build out a concept for that game in order to be able to teach that.

30:31.100 --> 30:31.740
Okay.

30:31.740 --> 30:34.780
I have an idea, but I need to like simplify it.

30:35.820 --> 30:36.320
All right.

30:37.100 --> 30:37.580
All right.

30:37.580 --> 30:39.820
Well, if that's it for your gaming week, my gaming week.

30:39.820 --> 30:44.460
So, uh, my video game play has still been hampered a little bit because the survivor

30:44.460 --> 30:46.300
LARP still going.

30:46.300 --> 30:49.900
Guess what everybody I am still in it.

30:49.900 --> 30:53.740
And there are six people left after today, starting from 22.

30:53.740 --> 30:54.140
Wow.

30:54.140 --> 30:54.860
Congratulations.

30:54.860 --> 30:55.180
Right.

30:55.180 --> 30:56.060
It's crazy.

30:56.060 --> 30:59.660
I, and I've, I've collected some votes along the way.

30:59.660 --> 31:05.100
There was a huge tribal this week and everybody thought I was leaving.

31:05.100 --> 31:06.220
Everybody thought I was leaving.

31:06.220 --> 31:09.260
And there was, I have to watch what I say about it because I don't know who's watching,

31:09.260 --> 31:13.100
but all I can, so I can really always say what's kind of like publicly known, but basically

31:13.100 --> 31:19.340
like there was a big play and somebody else left instead with two immunity idols in his

31:19.340 --> 31:20.220
pocket.

31:20.220 --> 31:25.900
So it was, yeah, it was a big, how do you leave with immunity idols?

31:25.900 --> 31:30.140
Because you have to, so I don't, have you watched survivor like ever or like recently?

31:30.700 --> 31:31.020
No.

31:31.020 --> 31:31.500
Okay.

31:31.500 --> 31:36.620
So they, they thought if you have the immunity idol, you would be immune competitions.

31:36.620 --> 31:38.620
You win an immunity necklace and they can't vote for you.

31:38.620 --> 31:42.940
But in later seasons of survivor, I think the first one was in Guatemala, the 12th season.

31:43.340 --> 31:48.700
What started happening is that they would hide immunity idols basically on the island

31:48.700 --> 31:50.540
and you would get clues to these idols.

31:50.540 --> 31:55.660
If you find one, you can play it after the votes have been cast, but before they've been

31:55.660 --> 31:56.300
read.

31:56.300 --> 32:00.540
So if you think that everybody's targeting you, there's goes a chance where Mr. Jeff

32:00.540 --> 32:03.580
Probst will go, if anybody has a hidden immunity, I'd only want to play it.

32:03.580 --> 32:04.540
Now is the time.

32:04.540 --> 32:07.980
And so somebody will pull out the idol and says, well, Jeff, here's this idol that I

32:07.980 --> 32:09.100
have in my pocket.

32:09.100 --> 32:11.980
And now the votes for me tonight don't count.

32:11.980 --> 32:17.500
So if like, let's say everybody on the tribe voted for you and you voted against like Jamie

32:17.500 --> 32:21.580
or something, then all the votes against me does not count, does not count.

32:21.580 --> 32:24.140
And then the last vote would say, Jamie, Jamie, you've been voted out.

32:24.140 --> 32:24.700
You have to go.

32:25.260 --> 32:25.820
Bye girl.

32:25.820 --> 32:26.300
I'm just kidding.

32:27.180 --> 32:28.380
She'd never play survivor.

32:28.940 --> 32:29.660
No, I would not.

32:30.460 --> 32:34.460
So that, that would be like the, what would you say to show you had been kidnapped?

32:34.460 --> 32:35.500
I'm playing survivor.

32:37.580 --> 32:39.100
So anyway, so yeah.

32:39.100 --> 32:42.300
So he had two of them because he collected them throughout the game and he wasn't the

32:42.300 --> 32:45.980
first, there was another girl that was on the other tribe that apparently was voted

32:45.980 --> 32:46.860
out with one as well.

32:46.860 --> 32:50.300
So like, this is, this has been a big game about blindside and people.

32:50.300 --> 32:55.020
So it's been a bit very interesting, but anyway, so without saying too much and watching my

32:55.020 --> 32:56.460
mouth, there are six people left.

32:57.020 --> 33:00.460
It is going to be done by, so here's the weird thing.

33:00.460 --> 33:05.500
The finale is supposed to be a week from tonight, but I told them at the very beginning, I cannot

33:05.500 --> 33:07.260
do Sunday nights because I have this show.

33:07.260 --> 33:12.940
So if by some miracle of God, I actually am in the final two, they're going to have to

33:12.940 --> 33:14.460
move it because of this show.

33:14.460 --> 33:15.420
And they already know that.

33:15.420 --> 33:19.900
So they're going to have to do it either on Monday or getting voted because yeah, or yeah.

33:19.900 --> 33:21.980
And I'm going to, I'm going to lose because I'm not here.

33:21.980 --> 33:22.860
So I don't know.

33:22.860 --> 33:23.260
We'll see.

33:23.260 --> 33:26.460
So everybody cross fingers on your toes, but the good news is if you're sick of hearing

33:26.460 --> 33:31.100
me talk about this game, it is over one week from tonight because there's just not enough

33:31.100 --> 33:31.740
people left.

33:31.740 --> 33:34.940
So, uh, yeah, but it's been going for over 40 days.

33:34.940 --> 33:42.140
Anyway, um, Oh, some late breaking news, uh, over in a chat, uh, S2-100 Matt talking about

33:42.140 --> 33:43.500
what's happening on Evo.

33:43.500 --> 33:49.260
Tekken 7 season three, the trailer was shown for some new characters and S2-100 Matt says

33:49.260 --> 33:54.620
Zafina and Leroy Smith, who was an original character are the new characters in Tekken

33:54.620 --> 33:55.020
7.

33:55.020 --> 33:56.140
So fun.

33:56.140 --> 33:57.100
That's pretty cool.

33:57.100 --> 34:00.380
I was, I wanted to see if there was any crossover characters that were going to do there.

34:00.380 --> 34:04.860
So anyway, uh, other games I have, I have had a little time, you know,

34:05.020 --> 34:08.860
the survivor thing, because it's an individual game, like, you know, the competitions are

34:08.860 --> 34:12.060
a little different now, so it's not quite as much time that I'm burning.

34:12.060 --> 34:15.820
Um, so I have been able to play a little bit of games, but I've been playing mostly final

34:15.820 --> 34:18.380
fantasy 14, still working my way through the expansion.

34:18.380 --> 34:21.500
I just did the level 77 dungeon last night.

34:21.500 --> 34:24.940
And so, um, yeah, still making my way through the expansion, which I still love.

34:24.940 --> 34:29.260
Although I will say the quests leading up to that 77 dungeon were probably the lowest

34:29.260 --> 34:29.820
point yet.

34:29.820 --> 34:32.300
It was a little bit, little bit dry.

34:32.300 --> 34:35.980
The story was not as great in that zone, but I expect expecting it will pick back up.

34:35.980 --> 34:37.420
And that's certainly not a negative review.

34:37.420 --> 34:40.060
I'm still really enjoying the expansion overall.

34:40.060 --> 34:45.420
Um, and of course the cell phone games, I did Pokemon go community day yesterday, which,

34:45.420 --> 34:48.860
you know, I haven't been able to do the last couple cause they've been on a Sunday.

34:49.660 --> 34:53.420
But, uh, yesterday was a hundred degrees Fahrenheit here in SAC.

34:53.420 --> 34:56.460
So there was no way I was going to play outside.

34:56.460 --> 35:01.900
So we drove to the mall, Arden mall here, and we tried playing in there total bust.

35:01.900 --> 35:07.260
Like, yeah, the wifi or the GPS is not like everything in there as a gym and there's not

35:07.260 --> 35:08.460
enough spawn points.

35:08.460 --> 35:11.500
And the reason why it's bad that they're a gym is that you can't lure them.

35:11.500 --> 35:13.820
So it's just, it really wasn't good.

35:13.820 --> 35:15.260
The Galleria would be better.

35:15.260 --> 35:15.500
Yeah.

35:15.500 --> 35:18.540
We should have driven out all the way to the Galleria cause I've done a community day at

35:18.540 --> 35:19.820
the Galleria and it was much better.

35:19.820 --> 35:22.220
But the GPS doesn't work well in there even.

35:22.220 --> 35:22.380
Yeah.

35:22.380 --> 35:23.980
We didn't want to drive all the way out there.

35:23.980 --> 35:28.380
So, um, we played there for about an hour before we were like, this sucks.

35:28.380 --> 35:32.060
And so we got in the car and I just turned on my Bluetooth and let the gotcha do the

35:32.060 --> 35:32.700
catching.

35:32.700 --> 35:35.500
And we just slowly drove through downtown safely.

35:35.500 --> 35:39.260
I didn't do anything risky, but we slowly drove through downtown and we drove around

35:39.260 --> 35:41.340
the Capitol in my nice air conditioned car.

35:41.340 --> 35:44.860
And we saw a ton of people, like a ton of people were still out, not bothered by the

35:44.860 --> 35:45.180
heat.

35:45.180 --> 35:46.940
They wanted their shiny routes.

35:46.940 --> 35:48.140
So good for them.

35:48.140 --> 35:50.460
And I did end the day with four shiny routes.

35:50.460 --> 35:51.580
So not, not bad.

35:51.580 --> 35:54.380
I still need to trade for my daily goal.

35:55.100 --> 35:55.420
Okay.

35:55.420 --> 35:57.740
Remind me at some point we'll, uh, we'll do a trade.

35:57.740 --> 35:57.980
Okay.

35:58.380 --> 35:58.700
Awesome.

35:58.700 --> 35:59.340
Awesome.

35:59.340 --> 36:04.220
So, um, anyway, uh, and then I played a little bit of the Harry Potter thing cause there's

36:04.220 --> 36:06.060
an event going on in that too.

36:06.060 --> 36:09.420
And I'm trying to collect the green books, but that's all I'll say about that.

36:09.420 --> 36:12.220
So let's get into some more gaming news.

36:13.660 --> 36:15.660
I don't think there's anything else for me to say right now.

36:15.660 --> 36:16.860
Housekeeping things.

36:16.860 --> 36:22.140
Uh, there will be no show labor day weekend and there will be no live show the weekend

36:22.140 --> 36:22.940
before.

36:22.940 --> 36:28.140
So since we are in August, there's really only going to be three live shows this month.

36:28.460 --> 36:30.300
We will be our last live show.

36:30.300 --> 36:34.140
This month will be the 17th because I'm sorry, I'm mathing wrong.

36:34.140 --> 36:38.780
18th, the 18th, our last live show this month will be the 18th because the 25th, I will

36:38.780 --> 36:40.140
already be out of town.

36:40.140 --> 36:43.580
I'm leaving for dragon con early this year to go hang out with my buddy extra for, I'm

36:43.580 --> 36:44.780
sure y'all can understand.

36:44.780 --> 36:45.660
I miss my friends.

36:45.660 --> 36:49.020
So I want to go hang out and I've never been to the town where he lives.

36:49.020 --> 36:51.660
So next weekend for me is weird Al.

36:51.660 --> 36:52.060
Yeah.

36:52.060 --> 36:53.740
So you won't be here next week.

36:53.740 --> 36:55.740
Um, but cause weird how you will.

36:55.740 --> 36:55.900
Yeah.

36:55.900 --> 36:57.100
Which is honest.

36:57.100 --> 36:58.620
Bobby missed his show for weird house.

36:58.620 --> 36:59.820
Now you're missing this one for weird out.

36:59.820 --> 37:00.860
So it makes sense.

37:00.860 --> 37:06.300
Um, but you will be here on the 18th and then, uh, what we're planning to do, we're going

37:06.300 --> 37:09.660
to record earlier in the week for the 25th.

37:09.660 --> 37:12.780
Uh, and we'll be doing a lot of listener questions on that episode.

37:12.780 --> 37:15.020
So, uh, stay tuned for Twitter and all that.

37:15.020 --> 37:17.820
We'll get some stuff out there because we want to, you know, since we won't have as

37:17.820 --> 37:20.540
much news cause it'll be partway through the week, we really want to digest some of your

37:20.540 --> 37:23.340
questions and answer some of those gaming questions you might have.

37:23.340 --> 37:27.500
And September 1st is my 14th anniversary.

37:27.500 --> 37:28.620
Mine and Dan's anniversary.

37:28.620 --> 37:29.500
Well, congrats.

37:29.500 --> 37:32.460
So well, if I don't bring him here, I may not be here.

37:32.460 --> 37:33.260
There is no show.

37:33.260 --> 37:33.820
Drag on.

37:33.820 --> 37:34.540
That's right.

37:34.540 --> 37:34.700
Yeah.

37:34.700 --> 37:35.660
Dragon cons that weekend.

37:35.660 --> 37:37.020
So bring me back something.

37:37.020 --> 37:37.900
I will, whatever.

37:37.900 --> 37:38.700
Let me know what you want.

37:39.260 --> 37:40.060
We'll do that.

37:40.060 --> 37:42.460
Um, so yeah, we're going to be not live for two weeks.

37:42.460 --> 37:45.980
So sorry to our Twitch crew or sorry to our Twitch crew who shows up.

37:45.980 --> 37:48.060
Bobby will be here on the 25th.

37:48.060 --> 37:52.620
So you will have something to watch that night cause he is not doing the pre trip.

37:52.620 --> 37:55.660
Just the dragon contract, but nothing will be live that week.

37:55.660 --> 38:01.660
However, we're exploring what we can do at dragon con.

38:01.660 --> 38:02.860
Not going to promise a life thing.

38:02.860 --> 38:07.740
I don't think, I don't think that's really in the cards, but could we maybe record something

38:07.740 --> 38:10.060
or we'll, we'll, we'll see.

38:10.060 --> 38:10.620
We'll see.

38:10.620 --> 38:11.580
We're thinking about it.

38:11.580 --> 38:13.260
So, uh, stay tuned for that.

38:13.260 --> 38:18.860
Um, I think I'm also allowed to say, speaking of dragon con, um, I will be on, I think I'm

38:18.860 --> 38:21.820
allowed to say this now, so I'm hoping I'm not speaking out of turn tentatively.

38:21.820 --> 38:24.380
I'm on seven panels at dragon con this year.

38:24.380 --> 38:27.100
And I'm really, they stream those out the panels.

38:27.100 --> 38:30.620
Um, actually, yes, I'm glad you asked the digital media track.

38:30.620 --> 38:34.860
So the podcasting track is now the digital media track and they will be streaming all

38:34.860 --> 38:36.620
of those panels on Twitch.

38:36.620 --> 38:41.100
So even though there's no OLR that weekend, you will get to see myself, uh, six of the

38:41.100 --> 38:45.820
panels, but I don't, they're only streaming the ones in room six, not in room seven.

38:45.820 --> 38:46.860
Cause there's actually two rooms.

38:46.860 --> 38:47.260
Hmm.

38:47.260 --> 38:49.660
I think most of my panels are in room six.

38:49.660 --> 38:51.500
I was going to say we could auto host that.

38:51.500 --> 38:51.980
Oh yeah.

38:51.980 --> 38:52.540
Oh, for sure.

38:52.540 --> 38:54.940
Vogel Vogel hosts the media track for sure.

38:54.940 --> 38:58.940
Um, but we will need to, uh, we'll let you guys know the schedule cause Bobby is on some

38:58.940 --> 39:00.620
that I'm not on and vice versa.

39:00.620 --> 39:03.100
So there'll be a lot of stuff for you guys to watch from dragon con.

39:03.100 --> 39:05.420
So yeah, they will be, they will be streaming some panels that weekend.

39:05.420 --> 39:08.700
So at least you can get, get a little fill and get some good topics.

39:08.700 --> 39:10.540
So, um, yeah, stay tuned for that.

39:10.540 --> 39:12.220
Uh, as 200 Matt says, wow, seven.

39:12.220 --> 39:12.460
Yeah.

39:12.460 --> 39:13.980
I'm really, really lucky this year.

39:13.980 --> 39:17.580
I guess, I guess I'm okay to say, I hope again, I really hope I'm not speaking out of turn.

39:17.580 --> 39:19.100
So I'm just gonna say tentatively.

39:19.100 --> 39:22.620
Um, the biggest panel I'm going to be doing at dragon con probably this year, cause it's

39:22.620 --> 39:23.580
in a ballroom.

39:23.580 --> 39:29.020
Uh, I will be, I will be, um, your moderator for the voice actors from world of Warcraft

39:29.020 --> 39:30.540
panel at dragon con this year.

39:30.540 --> 39:35.580
And I'm really jazzed about it because obviously, wow, is a game near and dear to my heart from

39:35.580 --> 39:37.500
hosting horde house for years and years.

39:37.500 --> 39:40.140
So, uh, yeah, I'm really excited about that panel.

39:40.140 --> 39:41.420
So, uh, stay tuned.

39:41.420 --> 39:44.140
I don't, I don't know if that one will be streamed unfortunately, cause that is on a

39:44.140 --> 39:47.260
different track that is on the gaming track and I don't think they stream all their panels,

39:47.260 --> 39:48.860
but we'll see never say never.

39:48.940 --> 39:51.580
So, um, yeah, really excited.

39:51.580 --> 39:52.060
Anyway.

39:52.060 --> 39:57.180
Um, let's move on and talk about some other gaming news that's going on in the industry.

39:57.180 --> 39:57.980
Loki.

39:57.980 --> 40:02.620
So the Sony PlayStation four has hit a hundred million units shipped.

40:02.620 --> 40:08.780
So it's apparently the, um, it was faster than the PlayStation two and we to hit that

40:08.780 --> 40:09.280
amount.

40:09.820 --> 40:16.860
And right now, apparently that the switch is reaching 36.8, 7 million tracking in line

40:16.860 --> 40:18.060
with the PlayStation four.

40:18.060 --> 40:24.220
So it eventually hit a hundred million, probably in around the same time period, but, um,

40:24.220 --> 40:26.060
interesting to see how well it's doing.

40:26.060 --> 40:29.340
I mean, don't really think about how many units are being sold nowadays.

40:29.340 --> 40:31.660
It's kind of like looking at the PlayStation five coming up.

40:31.660 --> 40:32.460
Yeah.

40:32.460 --> 40:36.940
So, well, but this is just, you know, a lot of us consider like the PlayStation four is

40:36.940 --> 40:38.780
like sun setting and it's on its way out.

40:38.780 --> 40:42.060
I mean, there might still be a few games that interest us, like death stranding and the

40:42.060 --> 40:43.420
seven remake and all that.

40:43.420 --> 40:45.980
So I think there's still a lot of interest in PlayStation four, but you're right.

40:45.980 --> 40:49.820
Like a lot of us kind of stopped thinking about how much that sells because most of

40:49.820 --> 40:54.700
the gaming enthusiasts such as us and many, many of you guys, but not all you guys have

40:54.700 --> 41:01.100
probably already picked up a PlayStation four, but we all know that budget gamers, gamers

41:01.100 --> 41:05.660
that, you know, can't necessarily drop hundreds of dollars on a console looking for things,

41:05.660 --> 41:07.740
you know, to come down in price and so forth.

41:07.740 --> 41:12.700
Like this is the time in the gaming generation where I think some people finally get on board

41:12.700 --> 41:16.940
because there's such a rich library of cheap games that have been out for a few years.

41:16.940 --> 41:20.940
And the price of the PlayStation fours are coming down and down and down, you know, as

41:21.580 --> 41:25.820
you know, as the gaming enthusiasts who tend to buy the new technology are starting to

41:25.820 --> 41:27.660
shift their focus towards the PlayStation five.

41:27.660 --> 41:29.900
So there's definitely an audience still for PlayStation four.

41:29.900 --> 41:30.540
Absolutely.

41:30.540 --> 41:30.780
Yeah.

41:30.780 --> 41:33.900
There will continue to be, you know, I'm sure there's people.

41:33.900 --> 41:37.660
In fact, I thought I knew somebody recently that said they had recently bought an Xbox

41:37.660 --> 41:43.660
360 at a game, like a used gaming outfit, like a flea market, you know, that type of

41:43.660 --> 41:45.260
thing buying Xbox 360.

41:45.260 --> 41:49.180
And I was like, cool, there's tons of Xbox 360 games out there waiting for you to play.

41:49.180 --> 41:50.940
Like, there's a great library of games on there.

41:50.940 --> 41:53.660
You can have a good time and, you know, the secondhand market for games.

41:53.660 --> 41:56.460
And if you want to get dirt cheap, there's dirt cheap.

41:56.460 --> 41:57.340
There's a lot to buy.

41:57.340 --> 41:58.460
So heck yeah.

41:58.460 --> 42:03.900
Like, you know, and I really believe even if you have to come late to the party because

42:03.900 --> 42:06.300
of financial situations or whatever, you're still a gamer.

42:07.020 --> 42:08.620
Like what makes you a gamer?

42:08.620 --> 42:10.860
Criteria one loves to play video games.

42:10.860 --> 42:11.660
End of list.

42:11.660 --> 42:12.140
Right.

42:12.140 --> 42:14.700
So, you know, if you're late to the party, you're still a gamer to me.

42:14.700 --> 42:19.100
So, uh, yeah, I think that's, that's cool that some people will still be able to get

42:19.100 --> 42:20.940
on onboard with PlayStation four.

42:20.940 --> 42:23.980
But yes, I'm sure a lot of us are now shifting focus to PlayStation five.

42:23.980 --> 42:28.140
Do we know kind of like comparatively, like where's Xbox one at compared to this 100

42:28.140 --> 42:29.260
million number for PlayStation four?

42:29.260 --> 42:31.100
Um, good question.

42:31.100 --> 42:35.020
So while you look that up, we have more breaking news coming out of evil.

42:35.020 --> 42:35.900
Really small.

42:36.860 --> 42:43.020
Actually, funny enough, the Xbox one is not listed on this because they're not out in

42:43.020 --> 42:43.900
Japan.

42:43.900 --> 42:48.540
That could be, uh, no, this is, this is from like an analyst that they have, like it charted

42:48.540 --> 42:48.780
out.

42:48.780 --> 42:49.820
Let me correct myself.

42:49.820 --> 42:51.260
Xbox one is out in Japan.

42:51.260 --> 42:55.500
We just all know it's a non-issue, but yeah, the Xbox one is not shown here.

42:55.500 --> 42:57.980
The 360 show on here, but not Xbox one.

42:57.980 --> 42:58.700
Interesting.

42:58.700 --> 42:59.020
All right.

43:00.140 --> 43:04.620
Um, so, uh, breaking news more out of Evo because they're showing a lot of trailers

43:04.620 --> 43:06.060
as things are wrapping up for the night.

43:06.060 --> 43:12.300
Uh, ARC system arc system just showed a trailer for a new guilty gear game coming in 2020.

43:13.260 --> 43:14.380
So that'll be exciting.

43:14.380 --> 43:16.220
And a lot of fans of guilty gear.

43:16.220 --> 43:18.860
And maybe that's something we'll see played at next year's Evo.

43:18.860 --> 43:19.900
We'll see about that.

43:19.900 --> 43:22.780
Uh, SEO 100 Matt saying that he's looking at the animation style.

43:22.780 --> 43:23.500
Looks good.

43:23.500 --> 43:27.420
It's a combination of 2d hand-drawn and like the 3d street fighter five stuff.

43:27.420 --> 43:28.300
Sounds cool.

43:28.300 --> 43:29.020
Looking forward to it.

43:29.740 --> 43:30.460
All right.

43:30.460 --> 43:34.220
So let's move on with some more news and talk a little bit about, Hey, speaking of like

43:34.220 --> 43:37.260
streaming and Twitch and stuff like that, this is pretty big news.

43:37.260 --> 43:42.380
Now I don't watch this guy personally, just because I prefer to watch friends and acquaintances

43:42.380 --> 43:44.940
and Twitter peeps and all that do streaming.

43:44.940 --> 43:47.500
But I know this guy does have a lot of people that watched him.

43:47.500 --> 43:52.540
And so this is going to be some, some big, interesting results from this.

43:52.540 --> 43:57.260
And it is Ninja real name, Tyler Blevins, uh, which is not me doxing him.

43:57.260 --> 43:59.100
That's a well-known fact that that's his name.

43:59.980 --> 44:08.620
So Ninja has made a deal to leave Twitch and made a whole video, uh, that was on his Twitter

44:08.620 --> 44:15.180
and stuff, uh, that he will now be exclusive on mixer, which is the Twitch competitor of

44:15.180 --> 44:17.820
sorts that is owned by Microsoft.

44:17.820 --> 44:22.860
And I think they have been trying very hard to leave a footprint of sorts in the streaming

44:22.860 --> 44:23.260
universe.

44:24.140 --> 44:29.340
I know that mixer is the place to kind of watch the Xbox press conferences and so forth.

44:29.340 --> 44:31.660
And you get your little mix pots and you do that and all that.

44:32.460 --> 44:33.900
But this is a pretty big deal.

44:33.900 --> 44:37.980
It's a big deal because, you know, we say it's, Oh, it's just one person leaving for

44:37.980 --> 44:40.620
mixer, but love him or hate him.

44:40.620 --> 44:42.780
Ninja has a gigantic audience.

44:42.780 --> 44:45.900
He is one of the largest streamers on Twitch right now.

44:46.460 --> 44:49.660
Well now on mixer as this announcement, but you know what I mean?

44:50.060 --> 44:54.780
And I think that's important because like, I know I saw a YouTube clip where this guy

44:54.780 --> 44:59.580
was on the Ellen show and he was like the face of the streaming community.

44:59.580 --> 45:00.140
Right.

45:00.140 --> 45:00.380
Yeah.

45:00.380 --> 45:04.860
And now when he goes on to these big talk shows and he, what he puts on his own fucking

45:04.860 --> 45:06.380
Fortnite thing, right.

45:06.380 --> 45:08.780
He had his own like a festival or things like that.

45:08.780 --> 45:09.100
Right.

45:09.100 --> 45:09.340
Yeah.

45:09.340 --> 45:13.260
And he was also, was that the new year's thing that they had that they were like advertising

45:13.260 --> 45:13.820
and stuff.

45:13.820 --> 45:17.980
This guy's big enough to have his own fucking festival, but now he's going to be pimping

45:17.980 --> 45:18.540
mixer.

45:19.420 --> 45:24.860
You know, and I'm sure Microsoft paid him a pretty penny to do it, but well, let me

45:24.860 --> 45:25.740
ask this question first.

45:25.740 --> 45:27.900
I'll ask of chat and ask of you guys.

45:27.900 --> 45:32.380
Do you, I mean, we don't know how much, cause that's all in secret, but do you think Microsoft

45:32.380 --> 45:37.740
made a good move by assumably paying him a hefty sum of money to move to mixer?

45:37.740 --> 45:37.980
Yeah.

45:38.700 --> 45:39.340
Yeah.

45:39.340 --> 45:39.740
Kind of.

45:40.380 --> 45:40.860
Yeah.

45:40.860 --> 45:43.260
I think it's a, I think it's a smart move.

45:43.260 --> 45:47.660
It's, I don't want to call it a desperate move, but it's definitely a move where you

45:47.660 --> 45:51.420
see Microsoft is like, we have to do something big.

45:52.060 --> 45:56.460
And so this is, you also kind of have to wonder, is there anybody else?

45:57.100 --> 45:59.340
Is Microsoft looking at anybody else?

45:59.340 --> 46:01.420
And let me just shut those rumors down right now.

46:01.420 --> 46:01.980
It's not us.

46:01.980 --> 46:05.020
No one's looking at us.

46:05.020 --> 46:08.780
Come on, we'll pay you one dollar.

46:08.780 --> 46:09.900
I like money though.

46:09.900 --> 46:12.300
Well, you do have a very attractive offer.

46:12.300 --> 46:18.540
But, uh, no, we're, we're doing, we're doing more than okay right here on Twitch.

46:18.540 --> 46:22.860
Thanks to your, uh, subscriptions on Twitch prime and thanks to all your, uh, biddies

46:22.860 --> 46:26.060
and things like that where we're not, I'm just making a joke where it's not something

46:26.060 --> 46:31.020
we're looking at right now, but it's interesting because even though I do love Twitch and support

46:31.020 --> 46:35.340
Twitch and I stream on Twitch, even as a personal person and as well as VOG network, then it

46:35.340 --> 46:36.620
puts some effort in this.

46:36.620 --> 46:42.220
I can still say this is really exciting news from my perspective, because I think a little

46:42.220 --> 46:47.500
bit of competition and a little bit of like challenging Twitch's dominance is a good thing

46:47.500 --> 46:51.740
because it's going to motivate Twitch to maybe do some other things to, you know, a little

46:51.740 --> 46:56.940
bit faster, like the co-streaming thing, which I think is still only partners only.

46:56.940 --> 47:01.500
Uh, I think a lot of us would really love to see that open up where it's, you know,

47:01.500 --> 47:03.260
more people can do those types of streams.

47:03.260 --> 47:08.700
I mean, hello, when Mario maker finally allows you to do those, uh, player levels online,

47:08.700 --> 47:11.100
I would love to co-stream with people on that.

47:11.100 --> 47:14.460
You know, let my buddies like VG realness and stuff, or Bobby black hole for something.

47:14.460 --> 47:16.220
I think we'd have a lot of fun with things like that.

47:16.220 --> 47:19.340
So, you know, if I wanted to do it on mixer, I could do it right now.

47:19.340 --> 47:22.700
So that is the thing that, you know, Twitch doesn't have yet.

47:22.700 --> 47:24.700
It has it for partners again, reiterating.

47:24.700 --> 47:27.580
So, and I know they're planning to open it up to more, but I think this might maybe light

47:27.580 --> 47:31.580
the fire a little bit to try to push some of those features out, maybe a little faster.

47:31.580 --> 47:32.460
I don't know.

47:32.460 --> 47:34.860
Let's go to you guys in chat with some comments.

47:34.860 --> 47:39.340
Um, Questbuster says Microsoft needs all the help it can get to boost mixer.

47:39.420 --> 47:44.620
Um, tiger class as Ninja will provide a lot of exposure for a lot of Microsoft's own games.

47:44.620 --> 47:48.060
You know, he'll get access to those exclusives before anyone else.

47:48.060 --> 47:48.940
Very good thought.

47:48.940 --> 47:55.100
I mean, Ninja is mostly known as a Fortnite guy, but Microsoft is invested in pub G aren't

47:55.100 --> 47:55.740
they?

47:55.740 --> 47:58.140
I don't remember if they are, they invested.

47:58.140 --> 48:00.940
It just seems like a lot of pub G stuff happens on Microsoft stuff.

48:01.500 --> 48:04.460
So would Ninja be playing some of these other games?

48:04.460 --> 48:05.340
Possibly.

48:05.340 --> 48:06.940
I wonder if that would be a thing.

48:06.940 --> 48:11.980
Um, tiger class says Ninja is mostly known for playing Fortnite, but no doubt he'll play

48:11.980 --> 48:12.940
the new halo game.

48:12.940 --> 48:13.500
Oh, I'm sure.

48:14.140 --> 48:19.500
Questbuster says he debuted on mixer with somewhere between 60 to 70,000 people watching.

48:19.500 --> 48:21.740
If I recall correctly, that's a pretty big deal.

48:22.460 --> 48:26.540
Uh, and SJ 100, Matt says also competition brings about innovation.

48:26.540 --> 48:28.620
Maybe this will push Twitch to innovate.

48:28.620 --> 48:30.940
And I don't think it's that like Twitch hasn't innovated.

48:30.940 --> 48:33.820
Like if I wasn't happy with Twitch, I wouldn't be here right now.

48:33.820 --> 48:37.980
But, um, you know, I, I liked this idea that it's maybe going to push it a little, it's

48:37.980 --> 48:42.700
going to needle them a little more and a little faster to, uh, respond to some of those things

48:42.700 --> 48:45.260
that mixer maybe has on them right now.

48:45.260 --> 48:50.220
So, uh, Questbuster, uh, responding to the halo thing says, interestingly, halo is where

48:50.220 --> 48:53.420
Ninja cut his FPS teeth before his Fortnite fame.

48:53.420 --> 48:55.020
Oh, very interesting.

48:55.020 --> 49:00.940
So anyway, and bonds 006 says I'm waiting for OLRs new address to be one Microsoft way

49:00.940 --> 49:02.620
in Redmond, Washington.

49:02.620 --> 49:07.100
No, I don't, again, I don't really see that happening anytime soon, but, uh, they bless

49:07.100 --> 49:09.660
your heart for thinking we have that kind of pull.

49:10.940 --> 49:14.460
So anyway, um, yeah, very, we'll, we'll see what develops with this.

49:14.460 --> 49:17.740
I want to, I'm, I'm so curious to see what Twitch does.

49:17.740 --> 49:23.100
I would see maybe something where it would make a lot of sense where either Twitch and

49:23.100 --> 49:28.540
Sony or Twitch and Nintendo are going to form some type of ally ship.

49:29.500 --> 49:33.740
I mean, granted Sony and Nintendo both broadcast, you know, their things on Twitch.

49:33.740 --> 49:36.300
Actually, I feel like Nintendo has always been a little more YouTube.

49:36.300 --> 49:40.300
They kind of linked their YouTube directs, uh, directly and all that stuff, but Nintendo

49:40.300 --> 49:41.740
certainly done the press conferences and things.

49:41.740 --> 49:43.740
So maybe there'll be some type of ally ship with Sony.

49:43.740 --> 49:44.140
Who knows?

49:44.140 --> 49:48.540
I mean, I I'm just, you know, if mixer is a Microsoft thing, maybe it would behoove

49:48.540 --> 49:53.900
Twitch to form a, you know, um, agreement, a working agreement or whatever you want to

49:53.900 --> 49:58.140
call it with Sony to try to see what they can explore together and do.

49:58.300 --> 50:04.220
So, Oh, anyway, uh, metal mayhem says in fairness, if Ninja's audience is mostly kids like

50:04.220 --> 50:07.980
Fortnite, if Ninja plays other games, is his audience going to give a shit?

50:08.540 --> 50:12.140
Um, I think, yeah, there would be enough, right?

50:12.140 --> 50:18.060
Even if, even if he got 10% of that viewership he had for his first stream, I mean, I'm

50:18.060 --> 50:19.820
sure he would bring in a lot for some people.

50:19.820 --> 50:20.140
Yeah.

50:20.140 --> 50:24.220
Because there's a lot of kids that will emulate what they see on YouTube.

50:24.220 --> 50:27.980
Like if some YouTuber is doing something they'll want to do, you know, this

50:28.860 --> 50:30.140
I do know this firsthand.

50:30.140 --> 50:34.140
So, um, yeah, I mean, to a certain extent, yes.

50:34.140 --> 50:36.700
You may have some people that are like, no, I'm not going to do that.

50:36.700 --> 50:43.180
But if there's a streamer having fun with a game and you know, they watch him and see

50:43.180 --> 50:46.860
that he's having fun with the game, then there might be more inclined to try that game.

50:47.420 --> 50:50.540
Which I mean, that kind of goes with a lot of people that I watch.

50:50.540 --> 50:54.300
So yeah, I could totally see that being a thing.

50:54.300 --> 50:55.740
It's only going to be positive.

50:56.620 --> 51:00.380
Um, just to put some things in perspective, some things, uh, from these nudist articles

51:00.380 --> 51:05.980
I wanted to share, uh, according to Streamlabs data, cause Streamlabs kind of watches, you

51:05.980 --> 51:10.060
know, a lot of what's going on and Streamlabs is the way how, like, if you do a host or

51:10.060 --> 51:13.340
you donate bits, the little ticker on the bottom of the screen will update for those

51:13.340 --> 51:15.340
of you watching on Twitch will ticker updates with that.

51:15.340 --> 51:17.900
So that way we don't have to stop our show to keep calling out.

51:17.900 --> 51:19.500
We do that at the end instead.

51:19.500 --> 51:21.020
Um, so Streamlabs is from that.

51:21.020 --> 51:22.540
So I know they watch a lot of feeds.

51:22.860 --> 51:29.180
But Streamlabs says Twitch was watched nearly 23 times as much as Mixer in the second quarter

51:29.180 --> 51:30.300
of 2019.

51:30.300 --> 51:32.380
That's pretty big, 23 times as much.

51:33.100 --> 51:35.980
Now Twitch did put out a statement, right?

51:35.980 --> 51:36.940
They have to respond to this.

51:36.940 --> 51:39.100
And they said, they said something very tactful.

51:39.100 --> 51:43.580
They said, we've loved watching Ninja on Twitch over the years and are proud of all that he's

51:43.580 --> 51:46.700
accomplished for himself and his family and the gaming community.

51:46.700 --> 51:49.500
We wish him the best of luck in his future endeavors.

51:49.500 --> 51:51.980
And then they promptly pulled his verified check mark.

51:52.780 --> 51:53.580
Which is true.

51:53.580 --> 51:56.540
He no longer has the little verified check mark on his channel.

51:56.540 --> 51:58.220
They, they pulled that same day.

51:58.780 --> 52:06.060
So, uh, interesting, but I mean, it might look like a Dick thing to do, but like business

52:06.060 --> 52:07.340
is business, right?

52:07.340 --> 52:11.500
You know, that he, he basically flew the coop.

52:11.500 --> 52:13.660
That's how they deleted his channel though.

52:13.660 --> 52:15.580
No, you don't want to delete the channel.

52:15.580 --> 52:18.940
That's a little much, but, um, you know, that's, that's it.

52:18.940 --> 52:22.060
He's not going to be pushed in search results or anything like that anymore.

52:22.860 --> 52:23.180
Sure.

52:23.740 --> 52:25.980
So, uh, that's funny.

52:25.980 --> 52:29.180
Nifty in chat says Twitch is a classy ex.

52:30.780 --> 52:32.780
I like that Twitch is a classy ex.

52:32.780 --> 52:33.820
All right, let's move on.

52:33.820 --> 52:35.020
Let's move on to our next story.

52:35.020 --> 52:36.140
Dark Sakura, what do you have for us?

52:37.420 --> 52:43.500
Well, just when we thought SNK couldn't do anything else cryptic, they did.

52:44.380 --> 52:54.700
Um, SNK global put out a, um, a tweet and it says a next gen Neo Geo hardware is coming

52:54.700 --> 52:59.500
after Neo Geo mini with a modern design and a wonderful play feeling.

52:59.500 --> 53:01.900
And you can even link it to Neo Geo mini.

53:01.900 --> 53:05.580
The new hardware will provide you a Neo Geo journey that you have never experienced.

53:05.580 --> 53:10.380
I think this might be a translation, but who knows what the hell this is.

53:10.380 --> 53:13.260
They haven't really said anything other than teasing.

53:13.260 --> 53:15.660
But something compatible with Neo Geo mini.

53:18.540 --> 53:18.940
Weird.

53:20.300 --> 53:21.980
They just did this all they had to say.

53:21.980 --> 53:23.900
So this is really just speculation.

53:24.700 --> 53:27.660
Um, I mean, the thing that's a little bit more interesting to me is that

53:28.220 --> 53:31.820
they are specifically stating it will work with the Neo Geo mini.

53:31.820 --> 53:35.580
So maybe this is just a little bit more to try to get people to buy it.

53:36.140 --> 53:39.900
Maybe it's like some type of like expansion pack with new games.

53:39.900 --> 53:41.660
Maybe something that like plugs in, I don't know.

53:41.660 --> 53:43.180
I'm reaching, but maybe something.

53:45.420 --> 53:47.980
Maybe, or maybe something that would allow them.

53:47.980 --> 53:52.380
Maybe they have a repository of games that, Oh, maybe it would be something

53:52.380 --> 53:55.100
that they could sell other games piecemeal or something.

53:55.100 --> 53:57.020
Gen, I guess that's true.

53:57.020 --> 53:57.340
Huh?

53:57.340 --> 53:57.820
I don't know.

53:58.380 --> 54:02.860
Unless they're referring to next gen for Neo Geo software, which would be the Neo

54:02.860 --> 54:06.460
Geo 64 stuff or whatever the fuck it was called.

54:06.460 --> 54:09.340
Are you suggesting a Neo Neo Geo?

54:11.660 --> 54:19.340
Yeah, it's Neo Geo.

54:19.340 --> 54:19.740
I don't know.

54:19.740 --> 54:22.780
What would you, you're you're you've played more Neo Geo than probably anybody

54:22.780 --> 54:23.260
else here.

54:23.260 --> 54:24.860
Cause you actually own one.

54:24.860 --> 54:26.780
So what, what would you like to see them do?

54:26.780 --> 54:29.500
Do you think, do you think that's in case you get back into the hardware?

54:30.700 --> 54:35.340
I want the be all end all AVS cartridge.

54:35.900 --> 54:39.740
I want them to release that as a special thing for everyone who still owns an AVS.

54:40.620 --> 54:44.220
What about like, speaking of arcade machines, Hey, those arcade one up things

54:44.220 --> 54:45.340
are all the rage, right?

54:45.340 --> 54:50.300
What about like a cabinet or something for like Neo Geo games, like a little mini

54:50.300 --> 54:53.580
cabinet, like those arcade one ups for your Neo Geo games, that would be pretty

54:53.580 --> 54:53.900
awesome.

54:54.460 --> 54:57.580
Yeah, but I've played one of those arcade one ups and they're kind of hard.

54:58.620 --> 55:02.860
They should totally do that in this, have it set up like the AVS four systems

55:02.860 --> 55:07.020
where you get, you can buy the individual cartridges and plop them in and be able

55:07.020 --> 55:08.140
to switch through them.

55:08.140 --> 55:09.820
And I hope the cartridges still cost $400.

55:11.980 --> 55:12.940
Why you gotta ruin everything?

55:13.820 --> 55:14.380
Sorry.

55:14.380 --> 55:17.100
Can't, can't resist those cards for those of you guys.

55:17.100 --> 55:20.780
And you know, some of you I know weren't really, you know, around or in the video

55:20.780 --> 55:26.060
game scene when Neo Geo is the thing, but seriously look at how gigantic those Neo

55:26.060 --> 55:27.100
Geo cartridges were.

55:27.100 --> 55:29.500
Like they were like the size of a shoebox.

55:29.500 --> 55:31.500
Like a VHS cassette or something.

55:31.500 --> 55:31.740
Yeah.

55:32.860 --> 55:33.100
Okay.

55:33.100 --> 55:34.860
That's a good way to put like an entire VHS.

55:34.860 --> 55:41.820
Actually, it's a little, if you held the cartridge up at full height and turn to

55:41.820 --> 55:46.860
VHS cassette on, on its horizontal edge, it would be just about as long, but

55:46.860 --> 55:50.620
probably another half as tall, if that makes sense.

55:50.620 --> 55:50.780
Yeah.

55:51.420 --> 55:55.420
And we've got a few, I mean, the one that we paid probably the last one Dan and I

55:55.420 --> 56:01.500
bought was KOF 2000 and we paid $325 for the cartridge.

56:01.500 --> 56:04.940
And that was actually a steal when that one came out.

56:04.940 --> 56:07.100
It was actually one of the lowest priced ones.

56:08.380 --> 56:09.100
Actually, I take that back.

56:09.100 --> 56:14.540
We paid $295 for it and that's how we got it because it was originally $375, but

56:14.540 --> 56:18.540
we've, we've got a, we've got like, I wouldn't say a handful cause one is a

56:18.540 --> 56:23.260
handful, maybe two, but we've got like a shelf full.

56:23.260 --> 56:28.380
I used to have a 48 in one bootleg card that I got with my arcade machine, my

56:28.380 --> 56:29.660
Astra city when I bought it.

56:30.540 --> 56:33.020
Cause I had an MVS for that as well.

56:33.020 --> 56:37.100
But, um, I gave it to Bobby, want to give him the super gun.

56:38.060 --> 56:39.100
So I don't have it anymore.

56:40.540 --> 56:40.860
All right.

56:41.580 --> 56:42.300
Well, let's move on.

56:42.300 --> 56:45.740
We have some more stories for you guys before we get to our walk down memory

56:45.740 --> 56:48.860
lane in our classic segment for this week.

56:48.860 --> 56:50.460
But first Loki.

56:50.460 --> 56:56.460
So apparently somebody has taken the trouble to go ahead and port Diablo to,

56:56.460 --> 57:00.780
um, the web, so you can actually play it in a web browser.

57:00.780 --> 57:05.420
So this is done thanks to the, uh, devolution team.

57:05.420 --> 57:06.140
I love that name.

57:06.700 --> 57:11.500
Um, so they actually have a GitHub that's talking about it where they basically

57:11.500 --> 57:16.140
ported over everything, including all of the glitches and bugs that were in it

57:16.140 --> 57:16.540
before.

57:17.260 --> 57:20.780
If you're interested in checking it out, you can actually play it at

57:20.780 --> 57:23.500
diablo.rivesoft.net.

57:24.220 --> 57:27.740
Um, it does require that you actually have a copy of the game if you want to

57:27.740 --> 57:28.620
play the full game.

57:28.620 --> 57:34.860
So you actually have to find your, uh, dhabdet.mpq file to drag into the

57:34.860 --> 57:38.540
browser windows so they can verify you have it, or you can buy it on GOG for

57:38.540 --> 57:39.100
10 bucks.

57:39.980 --> 57:43.180
Or they do have the shareware version available that you can play as well.

57:43.180 --> 57:46.700
And you can download that, but it's all playable within the browser.

57:47.580 --> 57:48.460
Pretty cool.

57:48.460 --> 57:48.700
Huh?

57:49.340 --> 57:50.380
Good way to kill time.

57:50.380 --> 57:50.700
Yeah.

57:50.700 --> 57:52.940
But you have to have that original file still.

57:52.940 --> 57:57.180
I'm sure it's not floating around on the internet on some, uh, uh, you know,

57:57.180 --> 57:58.700
dark website out there somewhere.

57:58.700 --> 57:59.340
It's only 10 bucks.

57:59.340 --> 57:59.660
Yeah.

57:59.660 --> 58:03.660
I think that's probably their way of like being like, well, we're not really

58:03.660 --> 58:05.260
letting you know, giving the game away.

58:05.260 --> 58:08.380
You still have to prove you on the game, but you know, wink, wink, right?

58:09.100 --> 58:13.020
So yeah, I will say though, if you've been playing like Diablo three or even

58:13.020 --> 58:18.380
Diablo two, going back to the original Diablo is not easy because I did, I

58:18.380 --> 58:21.900
bought the original Diablo when it came out recently.

58:21.900 --> 58:25.420
Um, and, uh, like for $10 and you know, it's fun.

58:25.420 --> 58:28.620
I like playing it as a piece of gaming history and all that, but it's

58:28.620 --> 58:30.220
Was that the remaster that they did?

58:30.220 --> 58:33.420
Or yeah, that, that minor remaster they did, it's not really remastered.

58:33.420 --> 58:35.020
It's just like, it runs in better resolution.

58:35.020 --> 58:36.620
We polished some of the sprites up.

58:36.620 --> 58:37.660
I wouldn't even say they did that.

58:37.660 --> 58:39.100
We polished the resolution.

58:39.660 --> 58:42.220
No, they, they, we re-released it.

58:42.220 --> 58:42.940
No, Loki.

58:42.940 --> 58:45.580
They let it run in a larger window than it used to run in.

58:45.580 --> 58:46.860
That's pretty much what it was.

58:46.860 --> 58:47.500
Yeah.

58:47.500 --> 58:51.180
So, uh, it's still, it still looks as blocky as ever, but I mean, it's, don't

58:51.180 --> 58:54.460
get me wrong, it's still fun, but it's just, you know, it is a game that shows

58:54.460 --> 58:58.380
its age a little more, uh, compared to something like Diablo three that has a

58:58.380 --> 59:00.860
lot of the quality of life improvements and so forth.

59:00.860 --> 59:03.980
So, uh, metal mayhem says, why would you play it on the web when you

59:03.980 --> 59:05.100
already have it on your PC?

59:05.660 --> 59:09.980
Because why, why do people install Linux on their refrigerators?

59:09.980 --> 59:11.340
Because they can, right.

59:12.300 --> 59:13.980
That's why they do it anyway.

59:14.540 --> 59:14.860
All right.

59:14.860 --> 59:15.340
Moving on.

59:16.220 --> 59:19.580
Uh, this is kind of an interesting, uh, new thing that Nintendo is doing.

59:19.580 --> 59:22.060
It's like, it's like they're stepping into the modern era when it comes to

59:22.060 --> 59:22.940
online a little bit.

59:23.740 --> 59:27.260
Nintendo has announced they are testing out game trials.

59:27.260 --> 59:31.820
It will allow you to play a full price game for free for a few days.

59:31.820 --> 59:35.660
If you have the Nintendo online program.

59:35.660 --> 59:40.060
So the first game that was announced for this is Mario Tennis Aces.

59:40.060 --> 59:43.660
It will be running from the 7th of August through the 13th of August.

59:43.660 --> 59:46.700
And if you liked what you played, you can go right on over to the eShop and

59:46.700 --> 59:49.500
get a 33% discount to buy the full game.

59:49.500 --> 59:53.340
Again, that's all only available if you have the Nintendo switch online membership.

59:53.340 --> 59:56.620
Um, this is something that Microsoft's done like free weekends.

59:56.620 --> 59:57.180
Right.

59:57.180 --> 59:58.860
And steam does this too.

59:58.860 --> 01:00:01.660
So it's just Nintendo is kind of joining in on this as well.

01:00:01.660 --> 01:00:05.340
Uh, I want to say, I felt like they did this once with Splatoon.

01:00:06.460 --> 01:00:08.140
I don't even know if it was the beta.

01:00:08.140 --> 01:00:12.220
I feel like they did like a thing mid, mid Splatoon 2, or maybe it was the first one

01:00:12.220 --> 01:00:14.060
where you could kind of play it for free one weekend.

01:00:14.060 --> 01:00:15.660
And then it was like, Hey, you can buy it.

01:00:15.660 --> 01:00:18.140
But now it seems like Nintendo is going to make this a regular thing.

01:00:18.140 --> 01:00:21.180
But again, if you have the switch online,

01:00:21.180 --> 01:00:24.300
Are they going to limit the number of plays like they did with their demos?

01:00:24.300 --> 01:00:25.980
Because that was fucking dumb.

01:00:25.980 --> 01:00:26.460
I don't.

01:00:26.460 --> 01:00:27.660
It's not in the statement.

01:00:27.660 --> 01:00:32.940
I mean, I guess we don't really know until it's out, but I do think that was a 3DS thing.

01:00:32.940 --> 01:00:35.580
And the switch doesn't really load the software the same way.

01:00:35.580 --> 01:00:37.340
They did it with the Wii U as well.

01:00:37.340 --> 01:00:37.980
Did they?

01:00:37.980 --> 01:00:38.460
Yeah.

01:00:38.460 --> 01:00:38.860
You're right.

01:00:38.860 --> 01:00:39.340
They did.

01:00:39.340 --> 01:00:39.820
They did.

01:00:39.820 --> 01:00:41.180
It's a stupid thing.

01:00:41.180 --> 01:00:41.740
Yeah.

01:00:41.740 --> 01:00:42.700
Well, maybe they will.

01:00:42.700 --> 01:00:43.100
I don't know.

01:00:43.660 --> 01:00:46.540
But I mean, even with 25 plays, that's a lot of plays.

01:00:46.540 --> 01:00:46.860
I know.

01:00:46.860 --> 01:00:48.620
But it's fucking dumb.

01:00:48.620 --> 01:00:48.860
Yeah.

01:00:50.540 --> 01:00:50.860
Dr.

01:00:50.860 --> 01:00:53.340
Sia says, Yeah, I think that was the Splatoon demo.

01:00:53.340 --> 01:00:55.020
I know they did that for Splatoon 2.

01:00:55.020 --> 01:00:55.340
Dr.

01:00:55.340 --> 01:00:59.500
Sia says in Japan, I believe they get Captain Toad for their program.

01:00:59.500 --> 01:00:59.980
Yeah.

01:00:59.980 --> 01:01:04.220
I should point out this story that I just read is from a Nintendo UK update.

01:01:04.220 --> 01:01:07.500
But I think I heard it was going to be in the US as well.

01:01:07.500 --> 01:01:08.860
So keep an eye out.

01:01:08.860 --> 01:01:13.980
I'm sure Nintendo will post confirmation on the Nintendo US Twitter next week if that's

01:01:13.980 --> 01:01:15.180
the direction they're going in.

01:01:15.180 --> 01:01:19.020
But it's still worth noting that they are doing this, even if they don't do it in North

01:01:19.020 --> 01:01:22.300
America right away, that they're doing it in other places.

01:01:22.300 --> 01:01:23.820
So we'll see.

01:01:23.820 --> 01:01:25.820
Stay tuned, I imagine, on Monday.

01:01:25.820 --> 01:01:27.900
Or maybe it is a test that they're not doing here yet.

01:01:27.900 --> 01:01:29.660
They want to see how it does in Europe and Japan first.

01:01:29.660 --> 01:01:30.380
Who knows?

01:01:30.380 --> 01:01:33.260
But I think it's still noteworthy to note that they're going in that direction.

01:01:33.260 --> 01:01:35.660
So all right, let's move on.

01:01:35.660 --> 01:01:37.740
Dark Sakura has more on Nintendo, right?

01:01:37.740 --> 01:01:38.380
I do.

01:01:39.260 --> 01:01:47.500
So Nintendo is going to be holding a game expo in Kyoto.

01:01:47.500 --> 01:01:50.860
And it will be Nintendo Live 2019 Kyoto.

01:01:50.860 --> 01:01:52.460
How's that for an apt name?

01:01:54.060 --> 01:01:56.540
Last year's, of course, was in Tokyo.

01:01:56.540 --> 01:01:57.660
And guess what was?

01:01:58.220 --> 01:01:59.340
It was in Tokyo.

01:01:59.340 --> 01:02:00.140
Just saying.

01:02:00.140 --> 01:02:04.140
But at any rate, they're going to have game tournaments, events, demos.

01:02:05.020 --> 01:02:06.780
They are among the stage events.

01:02:06.780 --> 01:02:12.460
They're going to do a Splatoon music show and a Super Mario Maker 2 stage show with

01:02:14.620 --> 01:02:16.700
a comedy duo called Yoiko.

01:02:19.180 --> 01:02:25.260
And there's going to be tournaments in Super Smash Brothers Ultimate, Splatoon 2, Super

01:02:25.260 --> 01:02:26.220
Mario Maker 2.

01:02:26.860 --> 01:02:32.380
And there will be winners of a Labo contest that will be on display.

01:02:32.380 --> 01:02:37.580
They didn't say what the demos are going to be yet, but we'll see what happens.

01:02:37.580 --> 01:02:38.940
But yeah, Nintendo does their own thing.

01:02:38.940 --> 01:02:40.620
They're like, screw Tokyo Game Show.

01:02:40.620 --> 01:02:41.020
Fuck it.

01:02:42.460 --> 01:02:43.660
We're doing our own thing.

01:02:43.660 --> 01:02:45.580
But they haven't always done their own thing.

01:02:45.580 --> 01:02:45.900
No.

01:02:45.900 --> 01:02:49.020
They had, what, Nintendo Universe one year or something like that, but they don't always

01:02:49.020 --> 01:02:49.260
do it.

01:02:49.260 --> 01:02:52.780
So it is interesting that they're doing it this year for whatever reasons.

01:02:52.780 --> 01:02:53.420
Yeah.

01:02:53.420 --> 01:02:57.900
But at any rate, it will be October 13th and 14th at the Kyoto International Conference

01:02:57.900 --> 01:02:58.140
Center.

01:02:59.020 --> 01:03:04.780
I would imagine that it's probably going to be the first playable Animal Crossing.

01:03:04.780 --> 01:03:05.900
Oh God, I hope so.

01:03:05.900 --> 01:03:06.780
Will probably be that.

01:03:06.780 --> 01:03:09.820
Because that's only going to be what, like five months away from the release of Animal

01:03:09.820 --> 01:03:10.620
Crossing?

01:03:10.620 --> 01:03:11.820
I want it now.

01:03:11.820 --> 01:03:16.780
I know you do, but you know, you can go to Japan and play it early, maybe.

01:03:16.780 --> 01:03:17.820
Pay for my ticket.

01:03:17.820 --> 01:03:18.140
Yeah.

01:03:18.140 --> 01:03:18.700
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:03:18.700 --> 01:03:20.620
Dark Tetsuya says, what was Space World?

01:03:20.620 --> 01:03:22.220
I'm sorry, it was Space World.

01:03:22.220 --> 01:03:23.420
I don't know what Nintendo Universe was.

01:03:23.420 --> 01:03:23.900
I made that up.

01:03:23.900 --> 01:03:25.420
But Space World was the thing I was thinking of.

01:03:25.420 --> 01:03:27.020
But Nintendo Universe does sound pretty cool.

01:03:27.020 --> 01:03:27.900
It does sound pretty cool.

01:03:28.940 --> 01:03:29.980
Should be their new console.

01:03:29.980 --> 01:03:30.380
I don't know.

01:03:30.380 --> 01:03:31.020
Patent pending.

01:03:31.820 --> 01:03:32.140
Anyway.

01:03:33.180 --> 01:03:35.020
So yeah, we'll see.

01:03:35.020 --> 01:03:37.500
Does Nintendo have something else next March?

01:03:37.500 --> 01:03:39.500
Because Pokemon will almost be out.

01:03:39.500 --> 01:03:42.620
So maybe they'll probably have some playable Pokemon stuff too, for sure.

01:03:42.620 --> 01:03:44.540
Because they're going to be pushing Sword and Shield.

01:03:44.540 --> 01:03:47.420
Did Nintendo date anything else for March next year?

01:03:47.420 --> 01:03:49.020
I feel like everybody was dating.

01:03:49.020 --> 01:03:52.300
Well, Animal Crossing becoming out shortly after that.

01:03:52.300 --> 01:03:53.980
No, Animal Crossing is March.

01:03:53.980 --> 01:03:55.180
Oh, is that March?

01:03:55.180 --> 01:03:55.740
Yeah.

01:03:55.740 --> 01:03:56.300
Oh, okay.

01:03:56.300 --> 01:03:58.540
No, it's Pokemon that's out shortly after that.

01:03:58.540 --> 01:04:01.660
So Pokemon would seem like, sureably, it's part of the event as well.

01:04:02.620 --> 01:04:04.700
I mean, they might unveil something new.

01:04:04.700 --> 01:04:05.980
There might be a surprise.

01:04:05.980 --> 01:04:08.140
I mean, it's Pikmin 5.

01:04:08.140 --> 01:04:08.620
Who knows?

01:04:08.620 --> 01:04:11.260
It's Luigi's Mansion 4.

01:04:11.980 --> 01:04:14.060
Let's make more sequels for those games.

01:04:14.060 --> 01:04:17.500
Quest Buster also points out that Nintendo is also going to be a Gamescom.

01:04:17.500 --> 01:04:21.420
That's not terribly surprising, but I imagine they're going to bring a similar setup to

01:04:21.420 --> 01:04:25.340
what they had at E3 and what's been traveling around the country with the Nintendo.

01:04:25.900 --> 01:04:28.300
You know, experience that they were that they had at the State Fair,

01:04:28.300 --> 01:04:29.980
which I missed out on and all that other stuff.

01:04:29.980 --> 01:04:30.380
Yeah.

01:04:30.380 --> 01:04:31.100
Yeah.

01:04:31.100 --> 01:04:31.740
So we'll see.

01:04:32.300 --> 01:04:35.500
I would have gone to the State Fair, but I ended up being out of town for the last week.

01:04:35.500 --> 01:04:35.820
Yeah.

01:04:35.820 --> 01:04:36.860
With that surprise trip.

01:04:36.860 --> 01:04:38.700
So anyway, all right.

01:04:39.580 --> 01:04:40.540
Moving on, Loki.

01:04:41.180 --> 01:04:48.780
So there's some more Labo VR support now for Captain Toad Treasure Tracker.

01:04:48.780 --> 01:04:53.340
So apparently with the version 1.3.0 update,

01:04:53.900 --> 01:04:58.380
you're able to actually play a version of the game that is compatible with that.

01:04:58.380 --> 01:05:05.100
So you have the seroscopic 3D and you can rotate around the different levels in a 360 degree view.

01:05:06.540 --> 01:05:07.020
I don't know.

01:05:10.780 --> 01:05:12.540
It's cool that they added that.

01:05:12.540 --> 01:05:13.500
They didn't have to do that.

01:05:13.500 --> 01:05:16.060
But this is not going to catch on.

01:05:16.060 --> 01:05:16.860
It really isn't.

01:05:16.860 --> 01:05:21.180
The Mario Odyssey stuff was kind of OK.

01:05:21.820 --> 01:05:22.700
It wasn't very good.

01:05:23.900 --> 01:05:26.540
I haven't tried the Legends, all this stuff.

01:05:26.540 --> 01:05:28.540
But I hear that's not good.

01:05:28.540 --> 01:05:30.780
And I can't imagine that this is going to be that great.

01:05:31.740 --> 01:05:33.420
The games themselves are all right.

01:05:33.420 --> 01:05:36.140
The Labo VR stuff.

01:05:36.140 --> 01:05:37.980
But I don't know.

01:05:37.980 --> 01:05:43.260
That Labo stuff just kind of gets boring pretty fast, unfortunately.

01:05:44.380 --> 01:05:44.700
Yeah.

01:05:44.700 --> 01:05:48.460
I mean, I guess it's cool that they went back and they patched in the support to try to like,

01:05:48.460 --> 01:05:52.780
you know, I like it when Nintendo tries to bring more value to their old games.

01:05:52.780 --> 01:05:55.980
And, you know, titles that have been out a little bit with like a surprise patch or something.

01:05:55.980 --> 01:05:57.740
But is this really added value?

01:05:58.460 --> 01:05:59.820
Because it didn't end up that way in the end.

01:05:59.820 --> 01:06:03.820
Well, I'm assuming that this stuff is probably not flying off store shelves anymore.

01:06:04.460 --> 01:06:10.540
If you can find a version of Labo, like if you want to check it out, the VR stuff,

01:06:10.540 --> 01:06:15.820
I'd recommend getting just that 40 dollar one with the like blaster gun thing.

01:06:15.820 --> 01:06:18.860
That was actually probably one of the more fun games that they had in there.

01:06:19.340 --> 01:06:23.260
Um, that'd probably be worth your money if you can get it cheaper than 40 bucks,

01:06:23.260 --> 01:06:25.420
which I think is what the retail is on it now.

01:06:26.220 --> 01:06:29.980
Maybe when it drops down to 20 might not be a bad deal.

01:06:29.980 --> 01:06:34.700
But yeah, don't definitely don't buy it for Captain Toad's Treasure Tracker.

01:06:35.820 --> 01:06:39.580
No, I did finally see one of those things on the shelf the other day, though,

01:06:39.580 --> 01:06:41.020
because, you know, they were hard to get for a while.

01:06:41.020 --> 01:06:43.260
But now they're they seem to be a little more available.

01:06:43.260 --> 01:06:43.580
Yeah.

01:06:43.580 --> 01:06:44.460
So, yeah.

01:06:44.460 --> 01:06:45.180
All right.

01:06:45.180 --> 01:06:46.140
Well, let's move on.

01:06:46.220 --> 01:06:50.940
And something that is not going to be available much longer is the YouTube app on the 3DS.

01:06:51.500 --> 01:06:55.660
It will be closing on September 3rd, 2019.

01:06:55.660 --> 01:06:59.180
So if you are still using your 3DS for YouTube, which, you know,

01:06:59.180 --> 01:07:02.780
I can't imagine there's a lot of people, but I could I could see like maybe like kids,

01:07:02.780 --> 01:07:04.860
you know, your kids if they didn't have a tablet.

01:07:04.860 --> 01:07:05.980
But yeah, OK.

01:07:05.980 --> 01:07:08.060
But they but they have another device that they can use.

01:07:08.060 --> 01:07:08.380
Yeah.

01:07:08.380 --> 01:07:10.540
And I guess a lot of folks probably do in that situation.

01:07:11.180 --> 01:07:15.020
So Nintendo did confirm that YouTube will no longer be available to download or

01:07:15.020 --> 01:07:17.260
function after September 3rd.

01:07:17.260 --> 01:07:20.380
And apparently the app has been having issues for a while anyway,

01:07:21.100 --> 01:07:24.460
as I'm sure YouTube has been doing their own upgrades and things behind the scenes.

01:07:25.100 --> 01:07:30.460
Maintaining the 3DS and as a platform is probably not their highest priority,

01:07:31.260 --> 01:07:35.180
as dark Tetsuya puts it in our chat at Twitch TV slash VOG Network.

01:07:35.180 --> 01:07:39.340
If you needed any more proof that the 3DS is on the way out, you're looking at it.

01:07:39.340 --> 01:07:39.660
Yep.

01:07:39.660 --> 01:07:41.180
It's another kind of nail in the coffin.

01:07:41.180 --> 01:07:41.660
Right.

01:07:41.660 --> 01:07:47.660
So see a YouTube app is available on the switch, which I imagine a lot of people are,

01:07:47.660 --> 01:07:51.660
you know, they're nudging them to upgrade to, especially with the switch light soon on the way.

01:07:51.660 --> 01:07:54.300
I think Nintendo would just love it if you replace

01:07:54.300 --> 01:07:58.380
your 3DS with one of those devices, if you must have YouTube.

01:07:58.380 --> 01:08:00.460
But like you said, a lot of people have a tablet.

01:08:00.460 --> 01:08:02.540
A lot of people do YouTube on their phones.

01:08:02.540 --> 01:08:05.340
I imagine it was probably mostly kids with 2DS at this point.

01:08:05.340 --> 01:08:06.940
They were probably still using YouTube.

01:08:06.940 --> 01:08:12.540
So as Joe and Hunter Matt says, to be honest, the YouTube app on 3DS was kind of bad to begin with,

01:08:12.540 --> 01:08:14.460
and they didn't really provide updates to it.

01:08:14.460 --> 01:08:17.500
So no big loss, I guess, for a lot of people.

01:08:17.500 --> 01:08:19.660
But I'm sure there's going to be that one person out there that was like,

01:08:19.660 --> 01:08:20.780
but I was using it.

01:08:21.900 --> 01:08:25.900
And they'll be sad, but hopefully they'll find a new device to do their YouTube's on.

01:08:26.620 --> 01:08:28.060
All right, let's take it.

01:08:28.060 --> 01:08:29.500
Let's take a step back in time.

01:08:29.500 --> 01:08:34.380
Let's go back to games that are still out and are still available and things that can still be

01:08:34.380 --> 01:08:37.740
played if you find this at a flea market.

01:08:37.740 --> 01:08:41.420
We're going to take a trip down memory lane with the classic game of the week.

01:08:41.420 --> 01:08:44.860
Every week, Dark Soccer steps into the gaming vault and finds a game that she thinks,

01:08:44.860 --> 01:08:47.180
hey, you guys should check this shit out.

01:08:47.180 --> 01:08:55.020
But once a month in a 2019 twist, once a month, Dark Soccer instead highlights a soundtrack.

01:08:55.020 --> 01:08:58.300
In fact, this year, it's 8-bit soundtracks that she thinks,

01:08:58.300 --> 01:09:00.460
listen up because this is some good music.

01:09:00.460 --> 01:09:01.740
So Dark Soccer is important.

01:09:01.740 --> 01:09:03.020
This means something.

01:09:03.020 --> 01:09:05.020
What is the classic soundtrack of the month?

01:09:05.020 --> 01:09:06.140
Blaster Master.

01:09:06.140 --> 01:09:07.020
Great pick.

01:09:07.020 --> 01:09:07.520
Yeah.

01:09:08.140 --> 01:09:11.500
And I had the music running through my head earlier today and I'm like,

01:09:11.500 --> 01:09:13.980
oh shit, I haven't done Blaster Master for music.

01:09:17.980 --> 01:09:19.100
Isn't this the best?

01:09:19.100 --> 01:09:19.820
It really is.

01:09:20.860 --> 01:09:21.360
Anyway.

01:09:22.620 --> 01:09:25.180
Chat, let me know if the audio is too loud.

01:09:25.180 --> 01:09:28.220
I think it's a little louder than usual, but I don't think it's too loud.

01:09:28.220 --> 01:09:31.260
Well, anyway, Blaster Master came out in 1988.

01:09:32.220 --> 01:09:35.580
Of course, on the Nintendo Entertainment System, or Famicom.

01:09:36.380 --> 01:09:40.780
And it really was very adventurous music.

01:09:40.780 --> 01:09:43.260
I mean, it made me feel like you were on a quest.

01:09:44.140 --> 01:09:47.180
And heroically on a quest, I might add.

01:09:47.980 --> 01:09:54.540
So at any rate, the music was actually composed by Kodaka Naoki.

01:09:55.420 --> 01:09:59.820
Other games that he did that people might know were,

01:10:02.780 --> 01:10:04.540
let's see, Route 16 Turbo.

01:10:05.340 --> 01:10:08.060
A lot of these only came out in Japan.

01:10:08.060 --> 01:10:10.540
Spy Hunter, but of course that's also a Peter Gunn theme.

01:10:14.140 --> 01:10:16.380
There was Dead Zone.

01:10:16.380 --> 01:10:17.740
I'm trying to think of some other ones.

01:10:17.740 --> 01:10:18.540
Freedom Force.

01:10:19.420 --> 01:10:21.340
Blaster Master, as we just said here.

01:10:22.220 --> 01:10:23.420
After Burner for Famicom.

01:10:24.220 --> 01:10:24.720
Batman.

01:10:25.580 --> 01:10:26.700
Fester's Quest.

01:10:26.700 --> 01:10:28.220
City Hunter for PC Engine.

01:10:29.020 --> 01:10:29.980
Journey to Silius.

01:10:31.100 --> 01:10:33.340
Remember, I brought that one up as a game.

01:10:35.020 --> 01:10:36.460
So this guy gets a gold star.

01:10:37.100 --> 01:10:38.540
Super Spy Hunter.

01:10:38.540 --> 01:10:41.260
He did a bunch of Batman games.

01:10:41.260 --> 01:10:44.220
And he also did Super Fantasy Zone for the Genesis.

01:10:44.220 --> 01:10:47.100
So of course, he's instantly awesome sauce.

01:10:48.060 --> 01:10:51.580
As far as those others who worked on the game,

01:10:53.100 --> 01:10:56.860
we actually have for our sound programmer,

01:10:56.860 --> 01:10:58.620
we have Morita Nagisa.

01:10:58.620 --> 01:11:03.660
We have also for the music driver, Seya Shinichi.

01:11:03.660 --> 01:11:07.900
So just really good team in all of these,

01:11:07.900 --> 01:11:09.020
you know, in various different ways.

01:11:09.020 --> 01:11:12.220
We worked on the music for a bunch of different really good games.

01:11:12.940 --> 01:11:17.500
So I really can't say too much else, you know,

01:11:17.500 --> 01:11:19.820
about how awesome the music is.

01:11:20.540 --> 01:11:21.500
It's all iconic.

01:11:21.500 --> 01:11:22.620
Every level is, of course,

01:11:22.620 --> 01:11:24.300
but none more so than the very first one

01:11:24.300 --> 01:11:26.540
where everyone has played that level.

01:11:26.540 --> 01:11:27.260
And so there you go.

01:11:28.540 --> 01:11:29.900
It's Blaster Master.

01:11:31.420 --> 01:11:33.500
That is your classic game or classic game soundtrack.

01:11:35.180 --> 01:11:38.140
And, you know, although I would encourage everybody

01:11:38.140 --> 01:11:39.580
to go find the old version of this,

01:11:39.580 --> 01:11:41.820
it's on like Wii Virtual Comedy.

01:11:41.820 --> 01:11:42.940
Obviously, that won't do you any good anymore,

01:11:42.940 --> 01:11:45.100
but I think it was on Wii U's Virtual Console as well,

01:11:45.100 --> 01:11:45.980
if I remember right.

01:11:46.540 --> 01:11:48.780
And then, of course, there's the remake, Blaster Master Zero,

01:11:48.780 --> 01:11:52.140
which, you know, as far as remakes go, it's not bad.

01:11:52.940 --> 01:11:55.660
And, you know, the way they reinterpreted the music and all that,

01:11:55.660 --> 01:11:57.180
they still did a pretty good job.

01:11:57.180 --> 01:11:59.420
So, you know, it's certainly better than nothing.

01:11:59.420 --> 01:12:01.740
Yeah, I could sit and listen to this all day.

01:12:01.740 --> 01:12:02.300
Yeah.

01:12:02.300 --> 01:12:03.980
Oh, and of course, start to see it points out,

01:12:03.980 --> 01:12:05.980
it is part of the Switch Online service.

01:12:05.980 --> 01:12:07.580
So if you have the classic NES library,

01:12:07.580 --> 01:12:08.620
you already have access to this.

01:12:08.620 --> 01:12:09.580
So go play it.

01:12:09.580 --> 01:12:10.080
Yay.

01:12:11.040 --> 01:12:12.160
And, you know, some of these,

01:12:12.160 --> 01:12:14.000
like now that we're getting into some of the later stages,

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:15.520
like everybody knows the stage one music,

01:12:15.520 --> 01:12:18.400
but I think this is, excuse me, stage three of this play right now.

01:12:19.040 --> 01:12:20.720
Yeah, there's a lot of great songs.

01:12:21.520 --> 01:12:22.640
If you get that far.

01:12:22.640 --> 01:12:24.080
Yeah, if you can get that far.

01:12:24.080 --> 01:12:30.240
But thanks to, excuse me, thanks to Switch Online and so forth,

01:12:30.240 --> 01:12:31.920
you know, you can use the save states and stuff.

01:12:31.920 --> 01:12:34.240
And I think that rewind features out now,

01:12:34.240 --> 01:12:36.960
so help you out a little bit with some of those harder fights.

01:12:36.960 --> 01:12:37.460
Agreed.

01:12:38.420 --> 01:12:40.740
There it is, your classic soundtrack of the month,

01:12:41.380 --> 01:12:44.900
Blaster Master, 8-bit soundtrack for the NES.

01:12:44.900 --> 01:12:46.980
If they did like a Pokemon version,

01:12:46.980 --> 01:12:48.740
they could do Blast Hoistmaster.

01:12:50.820 --> 01:12:51.940
I'd play it.

01:12:51.940 --> 01:12:52.820
Noted.

01:12:52.820 --> 01:12:54.500
All right, we're going to move on.

01:12:54.500 --> 01:12:56.980
Let's get into some rapid fire news

01:12:56.980 --> 01:13:00.260
and quickly travel around the gaming sphere

01:13:00.260 --> 01:13:01.780
and check out some quick news.

01:13:01.780 --> 01:13:02.580
Loki.

01:13:02.580 --> 01:13:06.980
So our awesome games that we're going to get for August,

01:13:07.060 --> 01:13:09.060
starting with PlayStation Plus.

01:13:09.060 --> 01:13:12.260
Sniper Elite 4 and the Wipeout Omega Collection

01:13:12.260 --> 01:13:13.700
are going to be those two games.

01:13:14.260 --> 01:13:16.340
It's sad that it's only two games nowadays,

01:13:16.340 --> 01:13:19.220
but Wipeout Omega Collection would be cool.

01:13:19.220 --> 01:13:20.820
I'm not a huge fan of Sniper Elite,

01:13:20.820 --> 01:13:22.340
but I'll take three.

01:13:23.540 --> 01:13:26.340
And then, of course, on the Microsoft side of things,

01:13:26.340 --> 01:13:30.100
we have Gears of War 4 on Xbox One

01:13:30.100 --> 01:13:34.100
and Forza Motorsport 6, two great titles there.

01:13:34.980 --> 01:13:36.020
Gears of War is going to be available

01:13:36.020 --> 01:13:39.220
for the month of August and Forza Motorsport 6

01:13:39.220 --> 01:13:40.660
will be from the middle point

01:13:40.660 --> 01:13:43.460
to the middle point of September.

01:13:43.460 --> 01:13:46.500
And then, of course, your Xbox 360 compatible games.

01:13:46.500 --> 01:13:47.620
You have Torchlight,

01:13:47.620 --> 01:13:49.620
which is going to be the first half of August.

01:13:49.620 --> 01:13:50.980
And then the second half,

01:13:50.980 --> 01:13:53.060
you get Castlevania Lord of Shadow.

01:13:55.460 --> 01:13:56.340
And then, of course,

01:13:56.980 --> 01:13:58.820
since we're talking about free games

01:13:58.820 --> 01:14:00.660
and we're all on Twitch right now,

01:14:01.460 --> 01:14:05.140
Twitch Prime has some free games this month as well.

01:14:05.140 --> 01:14:07.380
So you get a few games,

01:14:07.380 --> 01:14:09.700
including Wonder Boy, Pumped, BMX Pro,

01:14:10.660 --> 01:14:12.020
Mabel and The Wood,

01:14:12.820 --> 01:14:16.020
and then Automachef, or Automachef.

01:14:17.140 --> 01:14:20.100
And that's awesome.

01:14:20.100 --> 01:14:22.020
I keep forgetting to check for games.

01:14:22.020 --> 01:14:28.180
Usually they have the in-game currency

01:14:28.180 --> 01:14:30.420
or skins or something like that

01:14:30.420 --> 01:14:34.180
for a lot of these online games.

01:14:34.180 --> 01:14:38.580
But I remember we used to get more of the free games,

01:14:38.580 --> 01:14:39.620
like indie games and stuff.

01:14:39.620 --> 01:14:41.540
So I don't know if that stopped for a little bit

01:14:41.540 --> 01:14:42.980
and then they started doing it again.

01:14:42.980 --> 01:14:45.780
But I now remember to start looking at that stuff.

01:14:46.740 --> 01:14:48.740
Yeah, Twitch, if you do have Twitch Prime,

01:14:48.740 --> 01:14:50.020
they do have some pretty good deals

01:14:50.020 --> 01:14:53.140
in the giveaway stuff.

01:14:53.140 --> 01:14:54.900
I want to say I still see a few indie games

01:14:54.900 --> 01:14:55.940
in there now and then.

01:14:55.940 --> 01:14:57.540
It doesn't always start off the month either.

01:14:57.540 --> 01:14:59.060
Sometimes it shows up a little later.

01:14:59.060 --> 01:15:00.260
So yeah.

01:15:01.140 --> 01:15:02.180
And then of course,

01:15:02.180 --> 01:15:03.540
I know you didn't go over it yet,

01:15:03.540 --> 01:15:05.860
but if you are using the Epic Games Store,

01:15:05.860 --> 01:15:07.380
I know that store has a lot of controversy

01:15:07.380 --> 01:15:08.260
with it sometimes.

01:15:08.260 --> 01:15:10.020
But if you are using the Epic Games Store,

01:15:10.660 --> 01:15:13.060
there is a lot of stuff to find there too.

01:15:13.620 --> 01:15:16.180
And they're now giving away free games weekly.

01:15:16.180 --> 01:15:17.540
And if I'm not mistaken,

01:15:17.540 --> 01:15:19.540
this week's game is Alan Wake,

01:15:19.540 --> 01:15:21.460
which I think has been given away free before.

01:15:21.460 --> 01:15:22.900
So a lot of you probably have it.

01:15:22.900 --> 01:15:24.580
But if for some reason you've still missed out

01:15:24.580 --> 01:15:26.100
on Alan Wake after all this time,

01:15:26.100 --> 01:15:28.180
speaking of great Xbox 360 titles,

01:15:28.900 --> 01:15:30.420
that is a fantastic one that you should

01:15:30.420 --> 01:15:31.940
be checking out as Alan Wake.

01:15:31.940 --> 01:15:34.500
Yeah, I want to say that I have that

01:15:34.500 --> 01:15:36.340
from one of the Humble Bundles

01:15:36.340 --> 01:15:37.620
that I've purchased.

01:15:37.620 --> 01:15:38.420
But yeah,

01:15:38.420 --> 01:15:40.100
I think most people have probably picked it up

01:15:40.100 --> 01:15:40.900
one way or another right now.

01:15:40.900 --> 01:15:42.260
But that is a great one.

01:15:42.260 --> 01:15:45.460
Yes, Alan Wake and For Honor are free right now.

01:15:45.460 --> 01:15:47.060
Oh yeah, For Honor is up there too.

01:15:47.060 --> 01:15:48.260
So cool.

01:15:48.260 --> 01:15:49.060
I will have those.

01:15:49.060 --> 01:15:50.180
Build up your free game library.

01:15:50.180 --> 01:15:51.140
To my library.

01:15:51.140 --> 01:15:51.860
All right.

01:15:51.860 --> 01:15:53.780
Well, moving on and talking about

01:15:53.780 --> 01:15:57.540
some things going on with the Halo TV series.

01:15:57.540 --> 01:15:59.860
So you remember at Showtime's doing a Halo show?

01:15:59.860 --> 01:16:00.660
Remember that?

01:16:00.660 --> 01:16:02.660
I because I forgot until I heard the news this week.

01:16:02.660 --> 01:16:03.220
I forgot.

01:16:03.220 --> 01:16:03.620
That's right.

01:16:03.620 --> 01:16:05.300
Showtime's doing a Halo show

01:16:05.300 --> 01:16:07.380
and they have announced some casting.

01:16:07.380 --> 01:16:09.540
So Natasha McElhone,

01:16:09.540 --> 01:16:11.140
I hope I'm saying that right.

01:16:11.140 --> 01:16:13.540
She was on the show Ronin and Californication.

01:16:14.260 --> 01:16:16.100
She's going to be playing Cortana.

01:16:16.100 --> 01:16:17.380
She will be the Cortana AI

01:16:17.380 --> 01:16:18.900
in that game's pretty big role, right?

01:16:18.900 --> 01:16:20.340
She had a Windows 10 feature

01:16:20.340 --> 01:16:22.100
that then got scaled back, named after her.

01:16:22.980 --> 01:16:25.220
Also playing Dr. Catherine Helsey,

01:16:25.220 --> 01:16:28.420
who is the creator of Spartan soldiers like Master Chief.

01:16:28.420 --> 01:16:29.780
And I'm pretty sure there's a tie there

01:16:29.780 --> 01:16:31.380
to the Cortana and all that as well.

01:16:33.300 --> 01:16:35.140
There will also be some other folks.

01:16:35.140 --> 01:16:37.060
Bokeem Woodbine from Fargo

01:16:37.060 --> 01:16:39.300
is going to be playing Sorin 066.

01:16:40.100 --> 01:16:40.740
Let's see.

01:16:40.740 --> 01:16:44.660
Shabana Azmi will play the Office of Naval Intelligence head

01:16:44.660 --> 01:16:46.340
Margaret Paranigoski.

01:16:46.340 --> 01:16:47.700
I hope I said that right.

01:16:47.700 --> 01:16:50.180
And yeah, let's see some other Spartans.

01:16:50.180 --> 01:16:52.820
Bentley Kalu from Avengers Age of Ultron

01:16:52.820 --> 01:16:55.060
and Natasha Kolzak from The Witcher.

01:16:55.060 --> 01:16:56.980
Kate Kennedy from Catastrophe.

01:16:56.980 --> 01:16:58.020
So that's pretty cool.

01:16:58.740 --> 01:17:01.700
The series will not start production until later this year,

01:17:01.700 --> 01:17:05.540
and it will be on TV the first quarter of 2021.

01:17:05.540 --> 01:17:07.140
So it's still a little ways out.

01:17:07.140 --> 01:17:08.980
Gee, no wonder I didn't remember it.

01:17:08.980 --> 01:17:09.620
Yeah.

01:17:09.620 --> 01:17:13.060
So anyway, it's always, I think Spielberg's involved,

01:17:13.060 --> 01:17:15.140
if I remember right, was the thing with this.

01:17:15.140 --> 01:17:16.100
So yeah.

01:17:16.100 --> 01:17:16.740
Anyway, there you go.

01:17:16.740 --> 01:17:18.820
Halo TV show and some of the casting.

01:17:18.820 --> 01:17:20.580
And one other story I have for you

01:17:20.580 --> 01:17:21.860
before we go over to Dark Sakura.

01:17:22.500 --> 01:17:24.580
This story has to do with something

01:17:24.580 --> 01:17:26.260
that Riot Games is working on.

01:17:26.260 --> 01:17:28.020
We know that Riot Games, of course,

01:17:28.020 --> 01:17:29.700
is highly tied to League of Legends.

01:17:29.700 --> 01:17:30.740
That's their biggest game.

01:17:31.300 --> 01:17:33.860
But they did confirm at EVO, finally,

01:17:34.980 --> 01:17:36.660
that they are working on a fighting game.

01:17:37.620 --> 01:17:40.260
The fighting game, let's see, Tom Cannon,

01:17:40.260 --> 01:17:43.220
who's the founder of EVO, who works for Riot now,

01:17:43.860 --> 01:17:46.340
called it the worst kept secret in the universe.

01:17:46.340 --> 01:17:47.860
So during EVO's live stream, he said,

01:17:48.820 --> 01:17:52.020
excuse me, back in 2016, we joined forces with Riot

01:17:52.020 --> 01:17:54.180
and I said we were going to go into the hole for a while.

01:17:54.180 --> 01:17:55.460
I want to be able to let people know

01:17:55.460 --> 01:17:57.220
on the worst kept secret in the universe,

01:17:57.220 --> 01:17:58.820
which I can confirm we are working

01:17:58.820 --> 01:18:01.060
on a fighting game for Riot.

01:18:01.060 --> 01:18:03.620
Riot acquired Radiant Entertainment,

01:18:03.620 --> 01:18:06.180
which was the studio that he was a part of.

01:18:06.180 --> 01:18:08.180
So that's where this all comes together.

01:18:09.620 --> 01:18:12.500
They made an online fighting game called Rising Thunder.

01:18:13.140 --> 01:18:15.380
So anyway, no other details about the game,

01:18:15.380 --> 01:18:18.820
just it's coming, wait for it, anticipation,

01:18:18.820 --> 01:18:19.540
all that good stuff.

01:18:20.340 --> 01:18:21.300
Please look forward to it.

01:18:22.180 --> 01:18:22.500
All right.

01:18:23.300 --> 01:18:27.700
Dark Saga, do you have anything for us with rapid fire news?

01:18:27.700 --> 01:18:30.500
Well, there was a leak out about new characters

01:18:30.500 --> 01:18:32.740
coming out for Street Fighter 5.

01:18:32.740 --> 01:18:34.340
And so Calcomes is like, okay, here you go.

01:18:34.340 --> 01:18:35.140
Here's some trailers.

01:18:35.780 --> 01:18:43.460
So we have, looks like Lucia from Final Fight 3.

01:18:44.180 --> 01:18:49.380
We have E. Honda from, you know, classic Street Fighter.

01:18:49.380 --> 01:18:57.540
And we have Poison from Final Fight, sorry.

01:18:57.540 --> 01:18:59.380
So pretty cool group.

01:19:00.500 --> 01:19:01.940
I'd say they're going to be fun to use.

01:19:04.660 --> 01:19:06.020
And I'm sure a lot of people were like,

01:19:06.020 --> 01:19:07.620
we want Honda for real.

01:19:07.620 --> 01:19:10.340
And his, I actually saw like what all of his outfits are.

01:19:10.340 --> 01:19:12.660
He has kind of like this pimp looking outfit

01:19:12.660 --> 01:19:15.140
for his business outfit is actually kind of fun.

01:19:16.020 --> 01:19:18.980
Back in the day, back in Street Fighter 2, like in the day,

01:19:18.980 --> 01:19:19.700
like, what was that?

01:19:19.700 --> 01:19:21.380
Probably like early high school, junior high school

01:19:21.380 --> 01:19:22.500
when I was playing Street Fighter 2.

01:19:22.500 --> 01:19:23.620
I used to love E. Honda.

01:19:23.620 --> 01:19:25.620
Like I just love that character because I would,

01:19:25.620 --> 01:19:27.060
it was all about the a hundred hand slap.

01:19:27.060 --> 01:19:28.420
You just hit that punch button real fast

01:19:28.420 --> 01:19:29.860
and it was very, very annoying.

01:19:29.860 --> 01:19:31.940
And then of course Chun Li had her version of that,

01:19:31.940 --> 01:19:33.460
but for some reason his was better.

01:19:33.460 --> 01:19:35.140
Oh, because in the later Street Fighter games,

01:19:35.140 --> 01:19:36.980
you can move back and forth while you were doing it.

01:19:36.980 --> 01:19:38.420
In like Super Street Fighter and stuff.

01:19:38.420 --> 01:19:39.140
So, yeah.

01:19:40.100 --> 01:19:46.020
And then also the probably worst character ever

01:19:46.020 --> 01:19:48.980
in a Dragon Ball movie, Janenba is going to be

01:19:48.980 --> 01:19:52.100
in Dragon Ball FighterZ and Gogeta

01:19:52.100 --> 01:19:53.700
is going to be in there too.

01:19:53.700 --> 01:19:57.380
So that fucking movie was terrible,

01:19:58.180 --> 01:20:00.580
but it has like one of my favorite lines in there

01:20:00.580 --> 01:20:04.020
because it's okay.

01:20:04.020 --> 01:20:06.180
In the movie, Goku and Vegeta are dead.

01:20:06.180 --> 01:20:09.300
So they're in hell fighting this evil hell beast

01:20:10.100 --> 01:20:12.740
and Goku spends like half the movie.

01:20:12.740 --> 01:20:13.460
We need to fuse.

01:20:13.460 --> 01:20:14.500
We need to fuse to beat it.

01:20:14.500 --> 01:20:16.660
And Vegeta is like, I'd rather die than fuse.

01:20:16.660 --> 01:20:18.820
He's like, but Vegeta, we're already dead.

01:20:19.540 --> 01:20:20.980
So it has like my favorite line,

01:20:20.980 --> 01:20:22.100
but it's a really bad movie.

01:20:23.380 --> 01:20:24.020
Okay.

01:20:24.020 --> 01:20:24.520
All right.

01:20:26.420 --> 01:20:28.340
So let's travel around the world

01:20:28.340 --> 01:20:29.860
and check out some release dates

01:20:29.860 --> 01:20:32.180
and see what's coming out in this gaming store near you.

01:20:32.180 --> 01:20:32.680
Loki.

01:20:33.220 --> 01:20:34.180
Not a lot of stuff.

01:20:34.180 --> 01:20:36.980
We've got Age of Wonders, Planet Fall on PC,

01:20:36.980 --> 01:20:38.980
PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

01:20:39.780 --> 01:20:42.820
Illusion of La Fosia.

01:20:42.820 --> 01:20:45.300
And that's coming out on PlayStation 4.

01:20:46.420 --> 01:20:52.020
Metal Wolf Chaos XD on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

01:20:53.540 --> 01:20:56.340
We've got Pillars of Eternity Complete Edition

01:20:56.340 --> 01:20:57.300
on Nintendo Switch.

01:20:57.940 --> 01:21:01.140
Sword Art Online Fatal Bullet Complete Edition

01:21:01.140 --> 01:21:02.180
on Nintendo Switch.

01:21:04.420 --> 01:21:06.420
And that's it.

01:21:08.660 --> 01:21:09.940
Sorry, we got distracted here.

01:21:09.940 --> 01:21:10.660
The cat made it.

01:21:10.660 --> 01:21:11.700
Did he knock over the bottle?

01:21:11.700 --> 01:21:12.180
What was it?

01:21:12.180 --> 01:21:12.740
Was that you?

01:21:14.580 --> 01:21:16.260
Oh, did it wake him up or something?

01:21:16.260 --> 01:21:17.140
It disturbed him.

01:21:17.940 --> 01:21:18.660
Oh, okay.

01:21:18.660 --> 01:21:19.060
Weird.

01:21:19.060 --> 01:21:19.300
All right.

01:21:19.300 --> 01:21:20.340
Well, as long as he's okay.

01:21:20.340 --> 01:21:20.660
All right.

01:21:20.660 --> 01:21:21.380
Sorry.

01:21:21.380 --> 01:21:22.100
Just it.

01:21:22.100 --> 01:21:23.620
Mr. Smoosh is very important.

01:21:24.660 --> 01:21:26.500
He will be protected at all costs.

01:21:27.220 --> 01:21:28.100
So, all right.

01:21:28.100 --> 01:21:30.180
Anyway, sorry about that.

01:21:30.180 --> 01:21:33.380
So let's go over to Japan and check out releases there in Japan.

01:21:34.020 --> 01:21:35.140
Coming out in Japan this week,

01:21:35.140 --> 01:21:36.740
we have quite a few things on PlayStation 4,

01:21:36.740 --> 01:21:38.900
but many of them are games you've already had here.

01:21:38.900 --> 01:21:40.580
They're just coming out in Japan for the first time.

01:21:41.380 --> 01:21:43.140
Or a re-pricing.

01:21:43.140 --> 01:21:45.620
Fatal 12 is a new game though that's out in Japan.

01:21:45.620 --> 01:21:47.380
So that is coming out this week.

01:21:48.100 --> 01:21:51.140
I believe that also has like an English language option in it.

01:21:51.140 --> 01:21:52.900
So some folks may choose to import that.

01:21:52.900 --> 01:21:53.300
I don't know.

01:21:53.940 --> 01:21:55.060
Also on Japan this week,

01:21:55.060 --> 01:21:58.100
Wolfenstein Youngblood and Wolfenstein Cyberpilot.

01:21:58.100 --> 01:22:00.180
Also Friday the 13th of the game,

01:22:00.180 --> 01:22:02.740
moving into the hits collection for PlayStation 4.

01:22:02.820 --> 01:22:04.020
And let's see.

01:22:04.980 --> 01:22:06.820
Nioh also gets out.

01:22:06.820 --> 01:22:07.780
N-I-O-H.

01:22:07.780 --> 01:22:10.580
Nioh comes out for PlayStation hits.

01:22:10.580 --> 01:22:11.700
I think that's already been out,

01:22:11.700 --> 01:22:13.140
but it's getting a price reduction.

01:22:13.780 --> 01:22:16.420
Going over to the Switch and seeing what we have over there.

01:22:17.220 --> 01:22:19.460
Puyo Puyo Tetris gets a price reduction

01:22:19.460 --> 01:22:21.380
and a special price addition there.

01:22:21.380 --> 01:22:24.020
And Sword Art Online Fatal Bullet.

01:22:24.020 --> 01:22:25.540
That'll be a catch some eyes.

01:22:25.540 --> 01:22:26.500
That is out as well.

01:22:26.500 --> 01:22:28.900
And then Shining Resonance Refrain

01:22:28.900 --> 01:22:31.620
getting a new price addition there on the Switch as well.

01:22:31.620 --> 01:22:33.940
So some rereleases and some familiar things,

01:22:33.940 --> 01:22:35.940
but a couple of new games in there as well.

01:22:35.940 --> 01:22:37.140
Dark Sakura, how about the UK?

01:22:37.140 --> 01:22:41.060
I've only got three things for UK in the upcoming week.

01:22:41.060 --> 01:22:43.380
On the 5th, we have Age of Wonders Planetfall.

01:22:44.420 --> 01:22:48.340
That's going to be on PlayStation, Xbox, PC.

01:22:49.700 --> 01:22:52.100
For Switch, we have on the 8th,

01:22:52.100 --> 01:22:55.780
Ugly Dolls and Imperfect Adventure and Ultra Wings.

01:22:56.820 --> 01:22:59.380
Also, Ugly Dolls will be on PlayStation and Xbox.

01:23:00.180 --> 01:23:00.900
That's it.

01:23:00.900 --> 01:23:01.780
All right.

01:23:01.780 --> 01:23:03.940
Well, now we're going to get to the mailbag.

01:23:03.940 --> 01:23:04.820
Sorry, Dark Sakura.

01:23:04.820 --> 01:23:06.740
I know you getting ready to eat dinner there,

01:23:06.740 --> 01:23:08.180
but that's OK.

01:23:08.980 --> 01:23:10.900
Once we get past this, you'll have plenty of time to eat.

01:23:10.900 --> 01:23:12.420
So we're going to get to our mailbag statement.

01:23:12.420 --> 01:23:14.500
Every week, we invite you guys to send us emails

01:23:14.500 --> 01:23:17.780
to participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

01:23:17.780 --> 01:23:18.180
It's fine.

01:23:18.180 --> 01:23:20.740
And we pick a few of our favorite emails to read here on the show.

01:23:21.300 --> 01:23:23.860
Hopefully nobody in our inbox trying to tell us

01:23:23.860 --> 01:23:25.780
that they caught us wasterbaiting this week

01:23:25.780 --> 01:23:27.460
like we had last week.

01:23:28.260 --> 01:23:28.900
Dark Sakura.

01:23:28.900 --> 01:23:30.500
I deleted that and bypassed the trash.

01:23:30.980 --> 01:23:31.460
OK, good.

01:23:33.780 --> 01:23:34.260
Hi, all.

01:23:34.260 --> 01:23:35.780
It's Metal Mayhem or Raginator,

01:23:35.780 --> 01:23:37.300
whatever name you want to refer to me by.

01:23:37.300 --> 01:23:39.140
I don't really personally care to be H.

01:23:39.140 --> 01:23:40.980
Oh, whatever name, huh?

01:23:40.980 --> 01:23:41.300
Let's see.

01:23:41.300 --> 01:23:42.820
I'm going to call you Wastinator.

01:23:42.820 --> 01:23:44.100
OK, Wastinator, yes.

01:23:48.020 --> 01:23:49.140
Wastinator.

01:23:49.140 --> 01:23:53.220
I thought I'd try writing in since it may be difficult at best for me to call in.

01:23:53.220 --> 01:23:58.340
My PC headsets mic has bit the dust and doing a call via Discord on my phone

01:23:58.340 --> 01:24:03.540
will be a bigger pain in the ass than a visit to the proctologist that doesn't use lube.

01:24:05.300 --> 01:24:06.900
I didn't need that imagery.

01:24:07.620 --> 01:24:10.100
This week I thought I'd write in regarding PC gaming.

01:24:10.100 --> 01:24:13.700
For brevity reasons, I won't recount why I got into PC gaming in my email.

01:24:13.700 --> 01:24:15.380
That's been covered to death in the past.

01:24:15.940 --> 01:24:16.340
Thank you.

01:24:16.900 --> 01:24:23.140
Nonetheless, I'll mention that my first PC game

01:24:24.100 --> 01:24:29.060
was Diablo II war chest version with base game expansion manual and guide

01:24:29.060 --> 01:24:31.060
and that I got it at Target for 20 bucks.

01:24:31.940 --> 01:24:35.540
I got the game seeing as I had played Diablo on PS1

01:24:36.340 --> 01:24:38.900
and loved that game so I figured Diablo II would be good too.

01:24:39.700 --> 01:24:43.540
A few months later I joined Steam because Rob always used to mention

01:24:43.540 --> 01:24:45.780
them and their sales being akin to crack.

01:24:45.780 --> 01:24:46.740
My words, not his.

01:24:47.860 --> 01:24:51.860
Looking back, at this point I prefer PC gaming over console gaming

01:24:51.860 --> 01:24:54.500
due to the deals in one form or another.

01:24:54.500 --> 01:24:57.860
I managed to build a massive game library over the seven years,

01:24:57.860 --> 01:24:59.060
about 2000 games or so.

01:24:59.060 --> 01:25:01.220
That sounds like my normal games collection.

01:25:01.220 --> 01:25:02.660
Yeah, wow, it's so impressive.

01:25:02.660 --> 01:25:05.780
I never had that many games on consoles.

01:25:05.780 --> 01:25:09.060
All that being said, I'd like to pose these questions.

01:25:09.060 --> 01:25:11.540
For those of you that are PC gamers,

01:25:11.540 --> 01:25:14.660
what was your first PC game and why did you pick that as your first game?

01:25:14.660 --> 01:25:16.900
Additionally, what drew you to PC gaming to begin with?

01:25:17.540 --> 01:25:21.140
Fun fact, this email was completed and released before Loki completed and released Time to Car.

01:25:22.260 --> 01:25:24.980
What was your first PC game?

01:25:24.980 --> 01:25:25.780
I don't know if I can remember.

01:25:25.780 --> 01:25:29.940
My first PC was a 386 SX16 and it didn't run much.

01:25:29.940 --> 01:25:30.900
Commodore 64?

01:25:32.260 --> 01:25:35.620
Oh yeah, I guess Commodore 64 was a personal computer,

01:25:35.620 --> 01:25:37.460
if you want to say it in the purest sense.

01:25:37.460 --> 01:25:40.660
The first game I remember playing on the Commodore 64

01:25:40.660 --> 01:25:43.700
would have been one of two games that my memory pulls up.

01:25:43.700 --> 01:25:47.940
A game called Le Mans, like a racing game,

01:25:47.940 --> 01:25:50.100
and you would actually use the paddle as a cartridge

01:25:50.980 --> 01:25:52.580
that you would plug in the device.

01:25:52.580 --> 01:25:57.460
And it was like a pole position type of thing, but overhead.

01:25:57.460 --> 01:25:59.460
So the graphics weren't quite as complicated,

01:25:59.460 --> 01:26:02.340
but I do remember playing that and that was a really fun racing game,

01:26:02.340 --> 01:26:04.500
you know, when you're like seven years old.

01:26:05.060 --> 01:26:05.860
So I remember that.

01:26:06.820 --> 01:26:12.260
And then I also remember Slinky was one of the first PC games I had.

01:26:12.260 --> 01:26:15.540
And that game was scary because the music was scary

01:26:15.540 --> 01:26:18.900
and the big enemies that would come out were scary looking.

01:26:18.900 --> 01:26:21.300
But Slinky was basically a Qbert ripoff.

01:26:21.300 --> 01:26:23.220
It was completely a Qbert ripoff,

01:26:23.220 --> 01:26:24.740
but the board looked a little different

01:26:24.740 --> 01:26:27.220
and some of the monsters were very, very different.

01:26:27.220 --> 01:26:28.660
So like, it was creepy.

01:26:28.660 --> 01:26:30.500
Like when you die, all the monsters would come out

01:26:30.500 --> 01:26:31.940
and then like attack your corpse

01:26:31.940 --> 01:26:34.260
and a little flower would fall down like you were dead.

01:26:34.260 --> 01:26:35.860
Like it was, that's the part that was scary.

01:26:36.420 --> 01:26:39.860
So yeah, I guess if we went all the way back to Commodore 64,

01:26:39.860 --> 01:26:40.820
it'd be that.

01:26:40.820 --> 01:26:41.780
Pure PC?

01:26:43.220 --> 01:26:43.780
I don't know.

01:26:43.780 --> 01:26:46.020
I don't remember what the first games we had were.

01:26:46.020 --> 01:26:47.780
It had to have been a Sierra game.

01:26:47.780 --> 01:26:50.100
It had to be something like King's Quest 4

01:26:50.900 --> 01:26:53.940
or something that would run off the disks.

01:26:56.020 --> 01:26:56.740
I'm trying to remember.

01:26:56.740 --> 01:26:57.860
I haven't, I'm drawing a blank.

01:26:57.860 --> 01:26:59.140
Maybe Jones and the Fastlane.

01:27:00.260 --> 01:27:01.620
No, I feel like that game came out later.

01:27:01.620 --> 01:27:03.380
I feel like that was a 486 game.

01:27:03.380 --> 01:27:06.180
I remember playing on the PS, my friend,

01:27:06.180 --> 01:27:09.460
my friend had a PS2, not a PlayStation 2,

01:27:09.460 --> 01:27:13.140
but the IBM PS2, because I remember everything was PS2.

01:27:13.140 --> 01:27:16.420
In fact, they still sell PS2 compatible keyboards.

01:27:16.420 --> 01:27:18.100
That's what, you know, the design was for.

01:27:19.060 --> 01:27:22.260
I remember playing an X-Men game that was really fun.

01:27:22.260 --> 01:27:24.740
You had that, you were basically trying to save Storm.

01:27:24.740 --> 01:27:27.620
She'd been kidnapped and you were playing the other X-Men.

01:27:27.620 --> 01:27:30.500
Well, the whole, the reason why they couldn't have

01:27:30.500 --> 01:27:32.820
Storm be a character because she's too powerful.

01:27:33.860 --> 01:27:36.740
So they had to have a story where she gets kidnapped

01:27:36.740 --> 01:27:38.420
so they didn't have to make her a character.

01:27:39.700 --> 01:27:41.620
But you play it like a lot of the other X-Men.

01:27:41.620 --> 01:27:43.060
I remember that game being a lot of fun.

01:27:43.620 --> 01:27:46.340
So anyway, those are the best answers I have.

01:27:46.580 --> 01:27:47.860
TI 99 4A.

01:27:49.380 --> 01:27:51.380
It was, I had to look up the name again,

01:27:51.380 --> 01:27:52.740
cause I know it wasn't Space Invaders.

01:27:52.740 --> 01:27:55.380
It was TI Invaders and there was Munch Man.

01:27:56.420 --> 01:28:00.020
You guys also Parsec and Car Wars.

01:28:00.020 --> 01:28:01.140
Car Wars was a big one.

01:28:02.820 --> 01:28:05.460
I don't really remember anything on the Coleco Adam

01:28:05.460 --> 01:28:08.020
because all the cassettes would get erased

01:28:08.020 --> 01:28:09.540
in a power surge.

01:28:09.540 --> 01:28:10.580
So that was stupid.

01:28:11.380 --> 01:28:14.420
And then I'll be honest, I had used like all Macs at school

01:28:14.420 --> 01:28:15.380
and everything.

01:28:15.380 --> 01:28:20.340
So I'd say probably my first PC era game

01:28:21.140 --> 01:28:24.420
other than Gemstone, which was a tech space game,

01:28:25.300 --> 01:28:27.940
was probably the occasional different MUD

01:28:27.940 --> 01:28:32.740
or the Rogue clones and Doom.

01:28:34.980 --> 01:28:36.020
Doom's a good pick.

01:28:36.020 --> 01:28:37.300
That's a classic, classic PC game.

01:28:37.300 --> 01:28:37.800
And Loom.

01:28:38.820 --> 01:28:39.540
Oh yeah.

01:28:39.540 --> 01:28:40.500
You know, I love Loom.

01:28:40.500 --> 01:28:41.000
Oh yeah.

01:28:41.880 --> 01:28:45.800
I remember I had a game and I think it was LucasArts.

01:28:45.800 --> 01:28:47.240
Legend of Chirandia.

01:28:47.240 --> 01:28:49.640
You know, you've brought this game on the show, Loki.

01:28:49.640 --> 01:28:52.200
It's on Westwood Studios.

01:28:52.200 --> 01:28:52.760
That's right.

01:28:52.760 --> 01:28:55.560
It was like another studio that tried to kind of get in there.

01:28:55.560 --> 01:28:56.040
That's right.

01:28:56.040 --> 01:28:57.000
You're right.

01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:58.360
So yeah, I remember that game.

01:28:58.360 --> 01:28:58.600
Yeah.

01:28:58.600 --> 01:28:59.800
EA killed them.

01:28:59.800 --> 01:29:00.600
Oh, that's too bad.

01:29:00.600 --> 01:29:01.400
Westwood.

01:29:01.400 --> 01:29:03.720
They also did the Command and Conquer.

01:29:03.720 --> 01:29:04.600
Oh, right.

01:29:04.600 --> 01:29:04.920
Right.

01:29:04.920 --> 01:29:05.240
Okay.

01:29:05.880 --> 01:29:06.600
Loki, what about you?

01:29:06.600 --> 01:29:08.280
Earliest PC gaming memories.

01:29:08.280 --> 01:29:10.120
Also TI 99 4A.

01:29:10.360 --> 01:29:14.040
I also had Munch Man, but one I remember playing the most was Alpiner.

01:29:17.080 --> 01:29:18.680
I'm sure there's other games I had as well,

01:29:18.680 --> 01:29:21.320
but those are the only ones I remember off hand.

01:29:22.840 --> 01:29:23.800
Good question.

01:29:23.800 --> 01:29:29.800
My first actual PC, aside from the TI 99, was an IBM.

01:29:29.800 --> 01:29:30.280
I don't remember.

01:29:30.280 --> 01:29:36.920
It was a 286 PC and I had SimCity and I played it on a monochrome monitor.

01:29:36.920 --> 01:29:38.120
Oh, good pick.

01:29:38.840 --> 01:29:39.400
Yeah.

01:29:39.400 --> 01:29:39.800
Love it.

01:29:40.600 --> 01:29:41.320
Good picks.

01:29:41.320 --> 01:29:43.960
I did have Where in Time is Carmen Sandiego.

01:29:43.960 --> 01:29:45.640
I played a lot more of that in the world.

01:29:45.640 --> 01:29:49.800
Somebody in chat said the Where in Blank is Carmen Sandiego was their first game.

01:29:49.800 --> 01:29:51.160
So very good.

01:29:51.160 --> 01:29:51.960
Good picks all around.

01:29:51.960 --> 01:29:52.440
Good question.

01:29:52.440 --> 01:29:53.880
That was a fun trip down memory lane.

01:29:53.880 --> 01:29:54.360
So there you go.

01:29:54.920 --> 01:29:56.520
Any other emails or was that it?

01:29:56.520 --> 01:29:57.240
All right, that's it.

01:29:57.240 --> 01:30:02.520
So participate at orangeloungeradio.com if you want to send us an email in a future week.

01:30:02.520 --> 01:30:05.720
Meanwhile, we have some more stories for you guys before we get to Discord tonight.

01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:08.680
Oh, I apologize.

01:30:08.680 --> 01:30:09.880
We do have one more.

01:30:10.520 --> 01:30:11.400
Last minute email.

01:30:11.400 --> 01:30:11.720
All right.

01:30:12.360 --> 01:30:15.640
Rob, when you say you're sorting your Pokemon and Pokemon go by star rating,

01:30:15.640 --> 01:30:18.360
are you seeing all your zero star Pokemon at once?

01:30:18.360 --> 01:30:19.080
How do you do that?

01:30:19.080 --> 01:30:20.440
I'm not seeing such an option.

01:30:20.440 --> 01:30:21.480
This comes from Robert M.

01:30:21.480 --> 01:30:22.520
Oh, good question.

01:30:22.520 --> 01:30:28.680
So all you do is when you go into Pokemon first, number one is more important.

01:30:28.680 --> 01:30:32.040
Make sure you have latest version because if you're still running an old version,

01:30:32.040 --> 01:30:34.200
you're not going to be able to do that.

01:30:34.200 --> 01:30:37.560
But then what you do is you go into in the game.

01:30:37.560 --> 01:30:44.840
You're going to actually go into your Pokemon, which you can do with the little with the Pokeball.

01:30:44.840 --> 01:30:48.120
You touch that and you do Pokemon, and that's going to bring up all the Pokemon that you have.

01:30:48.120 --> 01:30:49.000
They can't see on the camera.

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:49.960
They can't see it on the camera.

01:30:49.960 --> 01:30:50.200
All right.

01:30:50.200 --> 01:30:50.700
I tried.

01:30:51.480 --> 01:30:57.160
But then you tap the magnifying glass at the top of the screen and you type zero and it's an asterisk.

01:30:57.160 --> 01:30:59.880
So when I say star, I mean the asterisk.

01:30:59.880 --> 01:31:03.080
And that's going to bring up all of your zero star Pokemon,

01:31:03.080 --> 01:31:06.760
which sadly two of the shinies I caught yesterday are zero stars.

01:31:06.760 --> 01:31:08.920
So use the asterisk and that's it.

01:31:08.920 --> 01:31:10.280
That's the only two characters you need.

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:16.040
Four star will show you all of your Pokemon that are 100%, which is pretty cool to see.

01:31:16.040 --> 01:31:19.080
I now have two centrets that are 100%.

01:31:19.080 --> 01:31:21.240
I wish I had a better Pokemon at 100%, but whatever.

01:31:22.920 --> 01:31:30.440
And you can also use three star for the wonder Pokemon or that's what they're called.

01:31:30.440 --> 01:31:34.200
If you're on the blue team, I forget what the red team and the yellow team say it on those appraisals.

01:31:34.200 --> 01:31:35.000
So that's it.

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:37.320
Just the two characters, zero and the asterisk,

01:31:37.320 --> 01:31:40.040
and use the magnifying glass at the top in order to be able to do that.

01:31:41.560 --> 01:31:42.200
Happy to help.

01:31:43.320 --> 01:31:45.480
Now that is all of our emails tonight.

01:31:45.480 --> 01:31:50.840
So participate at orangelaundry.com if you want to send us an email in a future week.

01:31:50.840 --> 01:31:53.880
In the meantime, something you want to add?

01:31:53.880 --> 01:31:55.880
No, just my dinner was ambitious.

01:31:55.880 --> 01:31:56.680
Oh yeah.

01:31:56.680 --> 01:31:59.240
It looks, it looks, you're welcome to some.

01:31:59.240 --> 01:32:01.960
Well, it smells like Chinese in here now, but it's a good smell.

01:32:02.440 --> 01:32:04.920
Lemon chicken and chicken chow mein.

01:32:04.920 --> 01:32:09.000
Which I don't say it on air, but I'm curious which place you got that from.

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:10.600
So China something.

01:32:10.600 --> 01:32:11.000
Okay.

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:11.320
All right.

01:32:11.320 --> 01:32:12.120
I believe you.

01:32:12.120 --> 01:32:13.000
Anyway, let's move on.

01:32:13.560 --> 01:32:15.400
Loki, let's get into some other news here.

01:32:15.400 --> 01:32:19.000
Let's talk about things that, um, never happened.

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:23.400
And that is that fancy graphics update for Minecraft.

01:32:23.400 --> 01:32:27.800
That was supposed to give us the 4k visuals and the improved lighting and all that stuff.

01:32:28.760 --> 01:32:33.240
Promised to us back in 2017 during E3.

01:32:33.240 --> 01:32:36.120
And unfortunately we haven't heard anything about it.

01:32:36.760 --> 01:32:40.040
The reason may be because there's not a lot of people working on it.

01:32:40.040 --> 01:32:45.080
Apparently only about eight people on the team are actually working on this project.

01:32:45.080 --> 01:32:49.480
And apparently it was harder than they originally thought because they have to actually

01:32:49.480 --> 01:32:54.040
rewrite or overhaul many portions of the engine to get it to actually work.

01:32:54.920 --> 01:33:00.520
So the super duper graphics pack, not going to be out anytime soon, unfortunately.

01:33:02.360 --> 01:33:02.860
Rude.

01:33:03.320 --> 01:33:03.820
Mean.

01:33:05.160 --> 01:33:06.920
I want my 4k Minecraft.

01:33:06.920 --> 01:33:07.320
Damn it.

01:33:07.320 --> 01:33:11.000
Well, in the meantime, PC and Sonic ether's unbelievable shaders.

01:33:12.120 --> 01:33:12.760
I guess.

01:33:12.760 --> 01:33:14.280
Leave it to the mod community.

01:33:14.280 --> 01:33:18.120
Speaking of the mic community, let's I'm a totally tangent this into something else.

01:33:18.120 --> 01:33:21.400
So something I've noticed Alan has been playing a ton of this week.

01:33:21.400 --> 01:33:22.520
Black Mesa.

01:33:22.520 --> 01:33:27.400
Because apparently, so, you know, Black Mesa is like, they redid Half-Life, right?

01:33:27.400 --> 01:33:30.520
So, um, but they've been working on the ending sequence.

01:33:30.520 --> 01:33:32.920
The Zen, I think it's called is that last sequence.

01:33:32.920 --> 01:33:38.760
So they just put out the first part of the Zen levels like this last week.

01:33:38.760 --> 01:33:42.360
So he's been playing a lot of that, just kind of revisiting Black Mesa because that's

01:33:42.360 --> 01:33:44.920
Half-Life is like one of Alan's like all time favorite games.

01:33:44.920 --> 01:33:46.520
So I know he revisits it once a year.

01:33:46.520 --> 01:33:48.920
So this is like his good opportunity to do that.

01:33:48.920 --> 01:33:54.600
So, but funny enough, the other game that Alan has been playing a lot lately is No Man's Sky.

01:33:54.600 --> 01:33:57.160
And there's some new news on No Man's Sky this week.

01:33:57.160 --> 01:34:00.520
We talked a little bit about this last week, but now we have a date.

01:34:00.520 --> 01:34:03.560
No Man's Sky VR, which is the Beyond version.

01:34:03.560 --> 01:34:08.040
So No Man's Sky Beyond will be out on August 14th.

01:34:08.040 --> 01:34:11.240
So there's some updates, including PSVR.

01:34:11.240 --> 01:34:12.120
That'll be very cool.

01:34:12.760 --> 01:34:14.600
I'm excited to try that on PlayStation.

01:34:14.600 --> 01:34:15.880
That's where I have the game.

01:34:15.880 --> 01:34:17.000
Alan plays on PC.

01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:18.040
I play on PlayStation.

01:34:18.040 --> 01:34:22.760
So sadly we're not in the same universe, but Beyond is also going to expand social

01:34:22.760 --> 01:34:24.440
and multiplayer options.

01:34:24.440 --> 01:34:28.680
So they're going to make it a little more like, you don't want to call it an MMO, but

01:34:28.680 --> 01:34:32.360
some of those things I think we all imagined in the beginning are going to be a little

01:34:32.360 --> 01:34:33.560
more there.

01:34:33.560 --> 01:34:34.840
And this update is free.

01:34:34.840 --> 01:34:38.440
It's not going to be something like a micro transaction, like you might see in an MMO.

01:34:38.440 --> 01:34:39.640
So very exciting.

01:34:41.240 --> 01:34:44.840
You're going to actually be able to meet and play with other people if you want.

01:34:44.840 --> 01:34:47.480
I don't know if I want to play with other people, but there you go.

01:34:48.520 --> 01:34:48.920
All right.

01:34:48.920 --> 01:34:49.560
Dark Sakura.

01:34:51.640 --> 01:34:52.040
Whale.

01:34:53.240 --> 01:34:54.520
How dare you when I'm digesting.

01:34:55.400 --> 01:34:57.320
Anyway, Pokemon Go.

01:34:58.120 --> 01:34:59.880
We haven't forgotten that it exists, right?

01:34:59.880 --> 01:35:04.680
Especially since you just got asked a question about sorting your Pokemanses.

01:35:06.440 --> 01:35:13.320
Well, the game actually hit a billion downloads in just three years after it was released.

01:35:14.280 --> 01:35:20.760
Pokemon Company actually released some videos commemorating the big marker.

01:35:21.400 --> 01:35:28.280
And of course, some of those billion downloads include redownload, but it's still a pretty

01:35:28.280 --> 01:35:32.120
good number, especially since they're like, oh, that won't make it past a year.

01:35:33.560 --> 01:35:34.040
Look, bitch.

01:35:34.920 --> 01:35:41.160
Anyway, of course, the numbers have slowed down because it's a mobile game, and we've

01:35:41.160 --> 01:35:44.040
just had Harry Potter Wizards Untie come out.

01:35:44.040 --> 01:35:44.360
Sorry.

01:35:44.360 --> 01:35:44.860
Unite.

01:35:46.360 --> 01:35:47.640
Wizards Untie.

01:35:47.640 --> 01:35:48.040
Love it.

01:35:48.040 --> 01:35:48.360
Okay.

01:35:48.360 --> 01:35:49.000
My brain.

01:35:50.440 --> 01:35:51.240
No, it's fine.

01:35:51.240 --> 01:35:51.720
It's funny.

01:35:52.840 --> 01:35:53.400
Yeah.

01:35:53.400 --> 01:35:55.240
I just keep thinking Untie.

01:35:56.760 --> 01:35:59.080
It's one of the spells you cast.

01:35:59.080 --> 01:35:59.800
Alohomora.

01:36:00.360 --> 01:36:01.000
That's unlocked.

01:36:02.920 --> 01:36:11.000
But anyway, it still gets about 147 million users per month.

01:36:11.880 --> 01:36:16.200
Um, and that was as of May this year.

01:36:16.200 --> 01:36:20.520
Hey, when I, you know, I just drove around the capital and I was floored by how many

01:36:20.520 --> 01:36:23.080
people I saw playing out there in the 100 degree heat.

01:36:23.080 --> 01:36:26.920
So there's still, I mean, Ralts is probably one of the most desirable Pokemon.

01:36:26.920 --> 01:36:29.080
A lot of people were waiting for this community today.

01:36:29.080 --> 01:36:32.920
Um, but, uh, yeah, I was, I was still shocked at how many people I saw out there.

01:36:32.920 --> 01:36:35.880
My buddy right now is a Ralts so I can get the special evolution.

01:36:36.680 --> 01:36:38.360
So nice.

01:36:38.440 --> 01:36:44.440
Or whatever the one up from Ralts is, uh, the, the one that's Gardevoir, but,

01:36:44.440 --> 01:36:46.440
uh, but there's a male one Galliate or something.

01:36:46.440 --> 01:36:47.640
That's the one I'm trying to get.

01:36:47.640 --> 01:36:48.200
Yeah.

01:36:48.200 --> 01:36:53.800
So I'm working on my Ralts right now so that I can use.

01:36:53.800 --> 01:36:56.840
I need to get another Sino stone on it, but yeah.

01:36:56.840 --> 01:36:58.600
So that's why I need to do a trade with you today.

01:36:58.600 --> 01:37:01.160
Those Sino stones are hard to get, but yeah, I'll trade with you.

01:37:01.160 --> 01:37:01.640
No problem.

01:37:01.640 --> 01:37:02.140
Yeah.

01:37:03.320 --> 01:37:04.120
All right.

01:37:04.120 --> 01:37:05.560
Uh, moving on just a couple more stories.

01:37:05.560 --> 01:37:08.200
Then we're going to open up Discord for your calls.

01:37:08.200 --> 01:37:11.880
If you want to give us a call over at vognetwork.com slash discord.

01:37:11.880 --> 01:37:12.380
Loki.

01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:22.600
So somebody has actually taken it upon themselves to remake, uh, Elder Scrolls Daggerfall in Unity.

01:37:23.320 --> 01:37:27.080
So it's a project that they started back in 2014 Daggerfall Unity.

01:37:27.720 --> 01:37:33.800
Uh, apparently they were trying to figure out how to actually port it to a modern PC

01:37:33.800 --> 01:37:36.520
because right now it's been played through DOS box.

01:37:36.520 --> 01:37:43.640
So he reverse engineered, um, basically how everything was kind of being read,

01:37:43.640 --> 01:37:45.640
all the different textures and stuff.

01:37:45.640 --> 01:37:47.560
And now they've put it in there.

01:37:47.560 --> 01:37:55.800
Apparently it is the largest elder school game with a 62,394 square miles of in-game world.

01:37:56.840 --> 01:37:59.640
So it says it takes 60 hours to cross on foot.

01:38:00.840 --> 01:38:01.800
That's pretty crazy.

01:38:02.440 --> 01:38:02.680
Yeah.

01:38:02.680 --> 01:38:06.520
Those, those older elder scrolls games, probably because they weren't as graphic intensive.

01:38:06.520 --> 01:38:09.960
So the design of the world didn't necessarily need to be as much, you know,

01:38:09.960 --> 01:38:14.440
like you look at a game like Skyrim and the environmental detail that goes into that.

01:38:14.440 --> 01:38:18.360
That's, you know, even though that world is massive, it is smaller than compared to

01:38:18.360 --> 01:38:21.160
these other games where you didn't have to have that same level of detail video.

01:38:21.160 --> 01:38:22.200
It's pretty crazy.

01:38:22.200 --> 01:38:22.520
Yeah.

01:38:22.520 --> 01:38:23.320
It looks awesome.

01:38:23.320 --> 01:38:29.160
So they did release, um, apparently some tools for Unity back in 2015.

01:38:29.160 --> 01:38:36.280
Um, although now it's, you know, getting more further along, basically it says, um,

01:38:36.280 --> 01:38:43.080
that they have the alpha build, which allows, um, Daggerfall to be played start to finish in Unity.

01:38:43.880 --> 01:38:46.920
Um, it's just crazy.

01:38:46.920 --> 01:38:48.520
Just the stuff that they have in here.

01:38:48.520 --> 01:38:55.800
So apparently they do, he does have a page dedicated to his process or progress.

01:38:55.800 --> 01:39:03.000
So, uh, at the website, www.dfworkshop.net and that's under his projects, Daggerfall unity.

01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:05.800
And so they have the different builds that are available and stuff for that.

01:39:06.440 --> 01:39:13.320
But, um, the brand new build, he has, um, it's alpha 10.3 and it's available.

01:39:13.320 --> 01:39:16.600
You can download on a windows Mac and Linux.

01:39:16.600 --> 01:39:20.360
Kind of makes you wonder why Bethesda hasn't bothered to go back and do, you know, some,

01:39:20.360 --> 01:39:23.320
some redoing of their own, but I guess, you know, it is a lot of work.

01:39:23.320 --> 01:39:24.680
This guy didn't get paid to do it.

01:39:25.160 --> 01:39:29.400
Cause if they were to go back and use Unity, that would mean working outside their own engine,

01:39:29.400 --> 01:39:34.600
which, you know, if they can port it into their broken ass engine to make new games.

01:39:34.600 --> 01:39:38.440
And they wouldn't want to take resources away from elder scrolls six, which I'm sure is,

01:39:38.440 --> 01:39:41.160
you know, something that they need to have their attention on.

01:39:41.160 --> 01:39:46.440
So, uh, Questbuster also points out Daggerfall used a kind of procedural generation

01:39:46.440 --> 01:39:50.280
to create such a huge map littered with towns, villages, and cities.

01:39:50.280 --> 01:39:53.320
You could try to walk across it or just use quick travel.

01:39:53.320 --> 01:39:54.200
That's true too.

01:39:54.280 --> 01:39:57.720
There was a lot more just kind of like procedural generation, uh,

01:39:57.720 --> 01:40:02.920
as in what you see in no man's sky is a great example of, you know, how vast you can make

01:40:02.920 --> 01:40:04.520
things with procedural generation.

01:40:04.520 --> 01:40:08.440
I mean, when you think about how fucking big a game like no man's sky is, it really like

01:40:09.400 --> 01:40:12.760
makes your mind, you know, makes you go cross-eyed, but that's all an algorithm

01:40:12.760 --> 01:40:16.200
basically that creates everything and creates it the same way for every player.

01:40:16.200 --> 01:40:19.640
So pretty neat, but yeah, it would be a similar concept to what you would have seen as some

01:40:19.640 --> 01:40:22.040
of these older, uh, elder scrolls games.

01:40:22.040 --> 01:40:22.840
So very cool.

01:40:23.400 --> 01:40:23.800
All right.

01:40:23.800 --> 01:40:28.200
Anyway, uh, one more story for you guys and boy, did I save the best for last because

01:40:28.200 --> 01:40:30.360
I know folks are very excited.

01:40:30.360 --> 01:40:33.080
Uh, they want to hear all about new carting games.

01:40:33.080 --> 01:40:35.400
I know y'all are big on Mario Kart, right?

01:40:35.400 --> 01:40:39.000
Well, this isn't about a new Mario Kart game, but I would say it's just as important.

01:40:40.040 --> 01:40:40.760
That's right.

01:40:40.760 --> 01:40:45.560
Uh, this past week we had the announcement of a brand new Garfield Kart game.

01:40:46.120 --> 01:40:47.480
They're making a sequel.

01:40:47.480 --> 01:40:50.440
The original Garfield Kart came out in 2013.

01:40:50.440 --> 01:40:53.240
Then it was remastered or something in 2018.

01:40:53.240 --> 01:40:56.360
And then, uh, I guess, I don't know, it was, it was taken down.

01:40:56.360 --> 01:40:57.080
I don't know, whatever.

01:40:57.080 --> 01:40:59.160
Why would you remaster that game?

01:40:59.160 --> 01:41:00.120
Why not?

01:41:00.120 --> 01:41:01.480
Loki, why not?

01:41:01.480 --> 01:41:03.480
Why would you do dagger fall in unity?

01:41:03.480 --> 01:41:04.920
Because you can.

01:41:04.920 --> 01:41:06.280
Because you liked that.

01:41:06.280 --> 01:41:06.680
That's right.

01:41:06.680 --> 01:41:07.560
Elder Scrolls game.

01:41:07.560 --> 01:41:07.960
That's right.

01:41:07.960 --> 01:41:13.240
Anyway, uh, the game will be getting a sequel on Xbox one, PC, PS4, PC, and switch.

01:41:13.240 --> 01:41:15.560
Believe it or not, it is again, a cart racing game.

01:41:15.560 --> 01:41:17.320
Why is that in the Presley's?

01:41:17.320 --> 01:41:20.360
It is a cart racing game again, just in case you were unclear.

01:41:21.240 --> 01:41:22.280
It was going to be a car racer.

01:41:22.280 --> 01:41:23.080
There you go.

01:41:23.080 --> 01:41:26.680
Uh, Garfield, Odie and John will be the only stars in it.

01:41:26.680 --> 01:41:30.120
Uh, but there's five other characters, I guess that you unlock later on.

01:41:30.120 --> 01:41:33.880
Uh, 16 tracks that are inspired by the world of Garfield.

01:41:33.880 --> 01:41:34.840
How about that?

01:41:34.840 --> 01:41:38.920
Garfield furious racing is coming out in November.

01:41:38.920 --> 01:41:42.600
So, uh, let's see if the intro says things like, are you lazy?

01:41:42.600 --> 01:41:46.200
Like Garfield take shortcuts to overtake the other racers with the spring.

01:41:48.280 --> 01:41:50.120
I'm sure this game is going to win.

01:41:50.120 --> 01:41:52.200
All the awards later this year.

01:41:52.200 --> 01:41:55.640
When we start looking at the game of the year qualifiers and so forth.

01:41:56.200 --> 01:41:59.720
Uh, some comments in chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network.

01:41:59.720 --> 01:42:03.480
Dark did see it says at least Garfield cart won't have any microtransactions.

01:42:03.480 --> 01:42:06.920
Like the crash cart remaster just got later on after the reviews came out.

01:42:08.280 --> 01:42:14.040
Hopefully, uh, Sia Tabiri says I wanted Garfield cart minus Garfield.

01:42:14.040 --> 01:42:16.920
Good comment.

01:42:16.920 --> 01:42:21.480
I would love a Garfield game that like fully leaned into the Garfield names.

01:42:21.480 --> 01:42:25.880
Sia Tabiri says it's all actually just John driving around alone.

01:42:27.480 --> 01:42:28.920
I would love a meme cart.

01:42:28.920 --> 01:42:31.400
I mean, like a code to put in that would just do that.

01:42:31.400 --> 01:42:34.360
But then how do you get angry Luigi and meet meme racer?

01:42:34.360 --> 01:42:35.000
I don't know.

01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:35.800
Anyway.

01:42:35.800 --> 01:42:37.400
Um, let's see.

01:42:37.400 --> 01:42:38.760
And also, uh, what was the other comment?

01:42:38.760 --> 01:42:42.280
Oh, guys, you don't chat says I want to Heathcliff cart screw Garfield.

01:42:44.440 --> 01:42:45.560
Maybe they could team up.

01:42:45.560 --> 01:42:48.280
Wasn't Garfield the same one that was paired with us?

01:42:48.280 --> 01:42:51.320
Uh, acres at one point during its run on TV.

01:42:51.320 --> 01:42:51.640
Yes.

01:42:51.640 --> 01:42:53.960
And we know who else was in us acres.

01:42:53.960 --> 01:42:55.000
Our buddy Greg burger.

01:42:55.560 --> 01:42:56.280
Oh, that's right.

01:42:56.280 --> 01:42:57.160
He was.

01:42:57.160 --> 01:42:57.640
Yep.

01:42:57.640 --> 01:42:58.280
Yeah.

01:42:58.280 --> 01:42:58.760
Oh man.

01:42:58.760 --> 01:42:59.320
Good times.

01:42:59.320 --> 01:42:59.880
Orson.

01:42:59.880 --> 01:43:00.440
That's right.

01:43:00.440 --> 01:43:02.120
He was good time.

01:43:02.120 --> 01:43:02.920
And Grimlock.

01:43:05.080 --> 01:43:05.560
All right.

01:43:05.560 --> 01:43:08.520
Anyway, we are at the point in the show where we're going to take your calls.

01:43:08.520 --> 01:43:12.440
So if you want to give us a call, you can join us on our discord vog network.com slash

01:43:12.680 --> 01:43:17.880
And I'll have, you know, I'll have, you know, just in case you're saying that Heathcliff

01:43:17.880 --> 01:43:19.000
deserves a race game.

01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:21.240
They did have a Heathcliff racing game.

01:43:21.240 --> 01:43:27.160
Heathcliff the fast and the furriest also came out on the Wii in 2010.

01:43:27.160 --> 01:43:27.480
Thanks.

01:43:28.120 --> 01:43:31.240
Well, this isn't necessarily about video games.

01:43:31.240 --> 01:43:33.000
It goes back to our opening topic.

01:43:33.800 --> 01:43:38.360
Um, the website 8chan has been taken down by the hosting company.

01:43:39.240 --> 01:43:39.720
Oh, wow.

01:43:40.600 --> 01:43:45.480
So, um, after, you know, cloud fair just said, take it down.

01:43:45.480 --> 01:43:49.240
They also took down the daily stormer, you know, two years ago, but it found another

01:43:49.240 --> 01:43:50.360
place with their competition.

01:43:50.920 --> 01:43:58.440
But I'm just saying that when a supposedly neutral hosting company is done with you,

01:43:58.440 --> 01:44:04.040
you know, your shit, not the shit, but literal shit you have come out of someone's ass.

01:44:05.640 --> 01:44:06.840
Just saying, thank you for that.

01:44:07.640 --> 01:44:07.960
All right.

01:44:08.280 --> 01:44:13.080
Uh, if you want to give us a call, uh, vog network.com slash discord, uh, we would also

01:44:13.080 --> 01:44:17.880
welcome comments or questions in our chat room over at twitch TV slash vog network.

01:44:17.880 --> 01:44:21.320
If you wish to, uh, just ask us, maybe you're too shy to call in.

01:44:21.320 --> 01:44:24.520
You just want to ask a question that would be okay as well.

01:44:24.520 --> 01:44:27.320
Otherwise it's going to be an early night here at all our studios tonight, but that's

01:44:27.320 --> 01:44:27.800
all right.

01:44:27.800 --> 01:44:31.160
That's the way it goes sometimes, especially because we didn't have a break segment tonight.

01:44:31.160 --> 01:44:32.440
Um, do you have any last minute stories?

01:44:32.440 --> 01:44:32.840
Logie?

01:44:34.040 --> 01:44:34.540
Nope.

01:44:35.400 --> 01:44:35.880
All right.

01:44:35.880 --> 01:44:37.240
I don't have anything.

01:44:37.240 --> 01:44:39.960
Things are a little slow tonight here at studio OLR.

01:44:39.960 --> 01:44:41.320
What else do we talk about?

01:44:41.320 --> 01:44:45.160
Any, any, uh, cool collectibles or purchases in your home lately?

01:44:45.160 --> 01:44:46.120
Dark Sakura.

01:44:46.120 --> 01:44:48.440
I keep looking at my little indie arcade collection.

01:44:48.440 --> 01:44:50.520
I'm like, I wonder if there's more of those I'm behind on.

01:44:50.520 --> 01:44:53.960
I need to get, um, well, California extreme.

01:44:53.960 --> 01:44:59.080
I got my puka and, um, fry gar that, that doesn't count.

01:45:00.600 --> 01:45:04.360
I'm playing a lot of Sims and all I've done is build two houses.

01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:08.520
Uh, as Joe and her map points out, Evo is probably consuming some folks who normally

01:45:08.520 --> 01:45:09.160
call.

01:45:09.160 --> 01:45:10.120
Absolutely.

01:45:10.120 --> 01:45:12.600
I know Ramas at Brony Con, right?

01:45:12.600 --> 01:45:13.000
Yeah.

01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:15.720
Like it wasn't like the last one or something like that was this weekend.

01:45:15.720 --> 01:45:16.520
I heard something about that.

01:45:16.520 --> 01:45:18.360
It was like the last Brony Con or something.

01:45:18.360 --> 01:45:20.520
So I know he and Patty were cosplaying.

01:45:20.520 --> 01:45:21.720
Yeah, no, I saw that.

01:45:21.720 --> 01:45:26.200
So I, uh, yeah, I'm sure they'll talk about it on anime jam session this week on Tuesday.

01:45:26.200 --> 01:45:26.700
So, yeah.

01:45:27.240 --> 01:45:30.680
Have you guys been noticing too, uh, here at VOG network, if you, uh, tune in earlier

01:45:30.680 --> 01:45:32.760
in the day on Sundays, uh, girls gone, wow.

01:45:32.760 --> 01:45:33.960
They broadcast on Twitch.

01:45:34.120 --> 01:45:38.440
So sometimes if you tune into our channel around, uh, probably about like three o'clock

01:45:38.440 --> 01:45:43.240
Pacific or so, maybe two, maybe earlier, uh, you will see, uh, Raven and EJ doing their

01:45:43.240 --> 01:45:44.680
show, uh, here on Twitch.

01:45:44.680 --> 01:45:45.880
So that's pretty cool too.

01:45:45.880 --> 01:45:46.600
We love that.

01:45:46.600 --> 01:45:50.360
A lot of our longtime podcast buddies are coming over to Twitch and making the jump

01:45:50.360 --> 01:45:50.760
over here.

01:45:50.760 --> 01:45:51.480
Pretty cool.

01:45:51.480 --> 01:45:52.760
Oh, we have somebody in the green room.

01:45:52.760 --> 01:45:53.400
Let's get to it.

01:45:53.400 --> 01:45:55.000
It won't be a quiet night after all.

01:45:55.000 --> 01:45:56.520
Uh, hi, you are on orange launch radio.

01:45:56.520 --> 01:45:56.920
Who's this?

01:45:57.880 --> 01:45:58.520
Yo, what's up guys?

01:45:58.520 --> 01:45:59.400
This is guys Judo.

01:45:59.400 --> 01:46:00.040
Hey guys, Judo.

01:46:00.040 --> 01:46:00.520
Good to hear from you.

01:46:00.520 --> 01:46:01.400
What's on your mind tonight?

01:46:02.360 --> 01:46:06.200
Um, I'm a little concerned about no man's sky and, uh, the VR update.

01:46:06.920 --> 01:46:09.640
How so I can hear myself in the background.

01:46:09.640 --> 01:46:10.520
That's weird.

01:46:10.520 --> 01:46:10.840
Sorry.

01:46:10.840 --> 01:46:15.240
And we might have, the volume might've been up a little high and sometimes it gets picked

01:46:15.240 --> 01:46:16.200
up on the microphone.

01:46:16.200 --> 01:46:18.360
So we try to minimize that, but it happens.

01:46:18.360 --> 01:46:19.240
Go ahead with your question.

01:46:20.440 --> 01:46:20.760
All right.

01:46:20.760 --> 01:46:25.000
So we all know that the reason why we're getting this, uh, well, not, not the reason why we're

01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:29.080
getting the, uh, VR update, but one of the main reasons why we got this new no man's

01:46:29.080 --> 01:46:30.920
sky is just because of all the complaints.

01:46:30.920 --> 01:46:33.720
People were saying, you know, this wasn't a game that you promised us and yada, yada,

01:46:33.720 --> 01:46:34.520
yada.

01:46:34.520 --> 01:46:39.080
And I feel like that's starting to build up again with this VR thing.

01:46:39.080 --> 01:46:41.480
Cause I mean, the VR community is going crazy.

01:46:41.480 --> 01:46:43.160
Like they're acting like this is the second coming.

01:46:43.160 --> 01:46:44.440
They're like, this is going to be great.

01:46:44.440 --> 01:46:45.480
This is what VR needs.

01:46:45.480 --> 01:46:50.440
And I'm just like, I don't know if it's going to be, I don't know if it's going to be as

01:46:50.440 --> 01:46:52.440
big and special as you think it might be.

01:46:52.440 --> 01:46:54.920
You know, I want it to be, but I don't think so.

01:46:54.920 --> 01:46:59.160
Like, I'm not, you know, it's not because I have any beef with, with, uh, with hello

01:46:59.160 --> 01:47:01.560
games or anything like that, because I love the original no man's sky.

01:47:01.560 --> 01:47:05.480
I think I actually call your show and tell you guys that I was satisfied with what they

01:47:05.480 --> 01:47:07.240
originally made, you know?

01:47:07.240 --> 01:47:10.680
So it's not, you know, it's not me complaining, thinking that they can't build a better game,

01:47:10.680 --> 01:47:12.840
but I'm just like, I don't know.

01:47:12.840 --> 01:47:15.240
You guys might want to slow down a little bit on that.

01:47:15.240 --> 01:47:17.000
And I feel like I'm with you.

01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:17.560
I'm with you.

01:47:17.560 --> 01:47:19.400
Don't set the bar too high.

01:47:19.400 --> 01:47:21.080
Don't get your expectations too high.

01:47:21.080 --> 01:47:22.200
Cause you're exactly right.

01:47:22.200 --> 01:47:24.360
This is the exact same mistake people made.

01:47:24.440 --> 01:47:26.280
The first time around with the game.

01:47:26.280 --> 01:47:30.760
And I think for those of us that didn't buy into the hype as much, we weren't as disappointed

01:47:30.760 --> 01:47:33.880
with the font because I remember saying with those early, early press conferences, the

01:47:33.880 --> 01:47:35.960
no man's sky, like show me the fucking game.

01:47:35.960 --> 01:47:38.680
And until they do, I'm not going to get my hopes up that high.

01:47:38.680 --> 01:47:43.080
And you know, because I didn't get my hopes up that high, I was okay with the first no

01:47:43.080 --> 01:47:44.040
man's sky they put out.

01:47:44.040 --> 01:47:47.240
Like I didn't think it was going to be like game of the year, but I didn't think it was

01:47:47.240 --> 01:47:49.720
like as shitty as a lot of people made it out to be.

01:47:49.720 --> 01:47:54.040
Now, I think it's amazing and a great, you know, comeback story.

01:47:54.040 --> 01:47:59.160
And honestly, like, you know, with as much bullying and shit as hello games got over

01:47:59.160 --> 01:48:03.800
the first release of that game, we're just honestly damn lucky that they've stuck with

01:48:03.800 --> 01:48:07.960
it and really invested so much more in it and made it a better game and a game that

01:48:07.960 --> 01:48:09.800
I think a lot more people want to check out.

01:48:09.800 --> 01:48:14.280
And I think it's awesome that we're even getting VR in the first place, but I don't believe

01:48:14.280 --> 01:48:17.160
this game was really designed for VR.

01:48:17.160 --> 01:48:21.720
So I think inherently, it's probably not going to be the second coming of VR Jesus

01:48:21.720 --> 01:48:22.440
or whatever you want to call it.

01:48:22.440 --> 01:48:24.520
It's not going to be Beat Saber, something like that.

01:48:24.520 --> 01:48:26.760
That is like a definitive VR app.

01:48:26.760 --> 01:48:29.320
I think it'll be, but I don't think it'll be bad either.

01:48:29.320 --> 01:48:34.040
I mean, we'll see on the 14th, but I think it's going to be kind of cool to play a couple

01:48:34.040 --> 01:48:34.280
times.

01:48:34.280 --> 01:48:36.440
I think it'll be fun to have that immersion.

01:48:36.440 --> 01:48:41.880
No man's sky isn't necessarily a frantically placed game unless you're like me and you

01:48:41.880 --> 01:48:43.880
shoot the wrong aliens and they all start coming for you.

01:48:44.680 --> 01:48:47.240
But for the most part, it's not that frantic of a game.

01:48:47.240 --> 01:48:52.840
So I don't expect that VR is going to be a very hard thing to do in No Man's Sky.

01:48:52.840 --> 01:48:55.400
But I think it'll be neat.

01:48:55.400 --> 01:48:58.360
Some of the worlds in No Man's Sky are really beautiful.

01:48:58.360 --> 01:49:02.200
I remember Bobby and I ended up on some planet that was peaceful and it was a really good

01:49:02.200 --> 01:49:03.800
looking tropical planet.

01:49:03.800 --> 01:49:05.960
I would love to see that again in VR.

01:49:05.960 --> 01:49:07.080
I think it's going to be cool.

01:49:07.080 --> 01:49:11.640
I will probably start over on No Man's Sky for the fifth time when this VR update comes

01:49:11.640 --> 01:49:11.800
out.

01:49:12.520 --> 01:49:13.400
I'm excited to see it.

01:49:14.280 --> 01:49:17.400
Yeah, because I think VR was always planned for it.

01:49:17.400 --> 01:49:22.600
So I always thought the VR mode is just going to be more like you're just viewing things

01:49:22.600 --> 01:49:23.160
in VR.

01:49:23.160 --> 01:49:26.760
I didn't really think it was going to be a major part of the game.

01:49:26.760 --> 01:49:30.280
The way people are talking online, they feel like they're going to be flying to different

01:49:30.280 --> 01:49:34.840
planets, hanging out with their friends in their VR living room, watching a VR TV.

01:49:35.800 --> 01:49:37.720
They got these big high hopes for it.

01:49:37.720 --> 01:49:45.400
I'm just like, I just hope Hello Games, you know, that they will not learn their lesson

01:49:45.400 --> 01:49:48.360
because like I said, I don't think there was a lesson for them to learn, but I hope they

01:49:49.560 --> 01:49:53.960
realize like, okay, we don't want to get the hopes up and we're just going to have to like

01:49:53.960 --> 01:49:59.240
really deliver on this VR and give them as close to what we think they want as we can

01:49:59.240 --> 01:49:59.640
do.

01:49:59.640 --> 01:50:01.400
You know, so hopefully they got that done.

01:50:02.120 --> 01:50:04.120
I don't pin this one on Hello Games.

01:50:04.120 --> 01:50:06.840
I think they're just doing the normal level hype.

01:50:07.240 --> 01:50:08.680
Of course they put out trailers.

01:50:08.680 --> 01:50:10.600
Of course they put out screenshots and things.

01:50:10.600 --> 01:50:11.560
That's what you're supposed to do.

01:50:11.560 --> 01:50:13.640
That's what any game company does about their product.

01:50:13.640 --> 01:50:15.240
They're proud of what they're doing.

01:50:15.240 --> 01:50:20.120
So if people end up disappointed in the VR and No Man's Sky, I don't think Hello Games

01:50:20.120 --> 01:50:21.080
will be the one to blame.

01:50:22.040 --> 01:50:22.440
Right.

01:50:22.440 --> 01:50:22.840
Yeah.

01:50:22.840 --> 01:50:23.160
Yeah.

01:50:23.160 --> 01:50:25.720
And you were talking about collectibles earlier.

01:50:25.720 --> 01:50:28.520
I just wanted to say that I know you got another call coming in.

01:50:28.520 --> 01:50:29.560
Oh no, that's not your other call.

01:50:29.560 --> 01:50:35.800
Anyway, I actually bought the D&D, the Stranger Things D&D starter kit.

01:50:36.520 --> 01:50:37.320
And it's really cool.

01:50:37.320 --> 01:50:37.820
I liked it.

01:50:38.280 --> 01:50:42.360
Oh yeah, because that's all the rage right now with Stranger Things back on TV and the

01:50:42.360 --> 01:50:43.960
kids are playing D&D.

01:50:43.960 --> 01:50:48.040
That is pretty cool, though, that is probably exposing more people to Dungeons and Dragons

01:50:48.040 --> 01:50:51.800
and making them think, oh yeah, that's a thing I should get into as much as we might tease

01:50:51.800 --> 01:50:55.320
the fact that like Stranger Things mania is everywhere.

01:50:55.320 --> 01:50:59.000
You know, it's kind of cool that it's bringing more people into D&D.

01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:00.040
Yeah, it's deserved.

01:51:00.040 --> 01:51:01.960
You get five classes.

01:51:01.960 --> 01:51:04.840
Unfortunately, Max isn't in it.

01:51:04.840 --> 01:51:08.600
You don't get a Zoomer class, which I was like, how can you not have this Zoomer class

01:51:08.600 --> 01:51:09.000
in there?

01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:10.120
But they don't have that.

01:51:10.120 --> 01:51:13.240
But they have, you know, all the other five kids.

01:51:13.240 --> 01:51:17.880
You know, Eleven, Mike, Dustin, Lucas.

01:51:17.880 --> 01:51:19.320
Well, they're all in there.

01:51:19.320 --> 01:51:19.800
Wait a minute.

01:51:20.440 --> 01:51:24.040
So it's like a Stranger Things D&D where you're actually playing.

01:51:24.040 --> 01:51:25.240
I thought it was just a Stranger Things.

01:51:25.240 --> 01:51:26.360
Yeah, yeah, you're playing that.

01:51:26.360 --> 01:51:30.920
Yeah, if you remember the original season of Stranger Things, the D&D game that they

01:51:30.920 --> 01:51:31.480
were playing.

01:51:32.040 --> 01:51:33.480
You're playing that game.

01:51:33.480 --> 01:51:37.080
Like you actually have Mike's notebook with his notes.

01:51:37.080 --> 01:51:38.280
Like he's the DM.

01:51:38.280 --> 01:51:38.920
Yeah, okay.

01:51:38.920 --> 01:51:43.800
So not to spoil anything, but you go to that Upside Down and all that stuff.

01:51:43.800 --> 01:51:48.040
And they give you two Demogorgon figures, which are really cool.

01:51:48.040 --> 01:51:49.880
Like one is painted, one isn't painted.

01:51:49.880 --> 01:51:50.440
I don't know why.

01:51:51.080 --> 01:51:53.720
But yeah, so it's cool.

01:51:53.720 --> 01:51:54.920
It's only 25 bucks.

01:51:54.920 --> 01:51:57.240
You get that target a lot of different places.

01:51:57.240 --> 01:52:00.760
But it's got me back in the DM and role playing again.

01:52:00.920 --> 01:52:05.080
Like I took a break from it because I really couldn't find a role playing game that I was

01:52:05.080 --> 01:52:09.000
into because I'm drained out on the fantasy thing.

01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:11.960
I don't want to do the Wizards and Warlocks and all type of stuff.

01:52:11.960 --> 01:52:15.320
I was trying to find modern day spy era.

01:52:15.320 --> 01:52:20.120
And just recently I found the Marvel superhero role playing game.

01:52:20.120 --> 01:52:22.200
That was like the other game that TSR made.

01:52:22.760 --> 01:52:23.800
And that one is really cool.

01:52:23.800 --> 01:52:26.440
If anybody's in the tabletop gaming, you might want to pick up that.

01:52:26.440 --> 01:52:27.080
And it's free now.

01:52:27.080 --> 01:52:27.960
You can get it online.

01:52:27.960 --> 01:52:28.840
It's like a school.

01:52:29.720 --> 01:52:30.920
Yeah, but it's good game.

01:52:31.800 --> 01:52:32.520
Yeah, you know, it's good.

01:52:33.160 --> 01:52:33.800
Good.

01:52:33.800 --> 01:52:35.320
You know what I used to have back in the day?

01:52:35.320 --> 01:52:37.080
Like this is when I was still in high school.

01:52:38.040 --> 01:52:39.400
Street Fighter RPG.

01:52:40.360 --> 01:52:41.960
I was a fighter to RPG.

01:52:42.920 --> 01:52:43.480
That's nice.

01:52:44.120 --> 01:52:44.600
Yeah.

01:52:44.600 --> 01:52:46.360
And it's better than the angry Joe version, right?

01:52:46.360 --> 01:52:48.920
Because angry Joe, he's doing like a miniature game of it.

01:52:48.920 --> 01:52:54.120
And I think it's going to be crap, even I like angry Joe, but I don't trust him with

01:52:54.120 --> 01:52:55.320
his Kickstarter anyway.

01:52:55.320 --> 01:52:55.480
Yeah.

01:52:55.480 --> 01:52:55.880
So, yeah.

01:52:55.880 --> 01:52:57.320
So try those games.

01:52:57.320 --> 01:53:00.760
Try the Stranger Things, Dungeons and Dragons, and try the TSR.

01:53:01.960 --> 01:53:02.440
What was it?

01:53:02.440 --> 01:53:03.800
Marvel Superheroes, right?

01:53:03.800 --> 01:53:04.600
You can get online now.

01:53:04.600 --> 01:53:08.040
You just go to classicmarble.com and they have all the books, all the supplements.

01:53:08.040 --> 01:53:09.400
You can download them all for free.

01:53:09.960 --> 01:53:10.680
It's a cool system.

01:53:10.680 --> 01:53:11.480
It's a simple system.

01:53:11.480 --> 01:53:13.320
It's not like the D20 system.

01:53:13.320 --> 01:53:14.760
You're using percentile dice.

01:53:15.480 --> 01:53:16.040
It's really easy.

01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:18.680
I just have one thing to say to you.

01:53:20.120 --> 01:53:21.400
Second edition D and D.

01:53:24.040 --> 01:53:25.400
I still have all my stuff.

01:53:25.400 --> 01:53:26.680
I know what my THACO is.

01:53:27.480 --> 01:53:29.480
Awesome.

01:53:29.480 --> 01:53:31.320
Or if you just want to migraine play Rifts.

01:53:32.520 --> 01:53:33.240
All right.

01:53:33.240 --> 01:53:35.640
My friend, I'm going to let you go, but thanks so much for the call.

01:53:35.640 --> 01:53:37.720
All right, take care, buddy.

01:53:37.720 --> 01:53:39.160
VR in the future.

01:53:39.160 --> 01:53:39.480
All right.

01:53:40.360 --> 01:53:40.760
See ya.

01:53:41.560 --> 01:53:42.040
All right.

01:53:42.040 --> 01:53:42.280
Yeah.

01:53:42.280 --> 01:53:43.880
Maybe I'll see him in No Man's Sky.

01:53:43.880 --> 01:53:44.440
Who knows?

01:53:44.440 --> 01:53:45.160
Anything like that.

01:53:45.720 --> 01:53:46.360
I love it.

01:53:46.360 --> 01:53:46.600
Anyway.

01:53:46.600 --> 01:53:49.320
All that talk about VR Jesus made me think of The Lawnmower Man.

01:53:50.040 --> 01:53:50.520
How so?

01:53:51.080 --> 01:53:54.120
Just, I was trying to think of what VR Jesus would be.

01:53:54.120 --> 01:53:56.440
And all I could think of was The Lawnmower Man.

01:53:56.440 --> 01:53:57.000
That movie.

01:53:57.640 --> 01:54:00.280
I haven't seen that in probably since it first came out.

01:54:00.280 --> 01:54:01.080
In the theater.

01:54:01.080 --> 01:54:02.680
And that was the last time I saw it.

01:54:02.680 --> 01:54:03.160
Oh, wow.

01:54:04.280 --> 01:54:05.320
I just don't remember it.

01:54:05.320 --> 01:54:06.040
Weird as fuck.

01:54:06.040 --> 01:54:06.760
Yeah, it was weird.

01:54:07.640 --> 01:54:10.840
90s interpretations of computer culture are always great.

01:54:10.840 --> 01:54:14.760
Like The Net starring Sandra Bullock, or of course the movie Hackers.

01:54:14.760 --> 01:54:17.640
Like these are hilarious things to go back and watch.

01:54:17.640 --> 01:54:21.560
Heck, even the original Jurassic Park kind of had some funny computer stuff in it.

01:54:21.560 --> 01:54:21.880
You know?

01:54:23.640 --> 01:54:25.080
You didn't say the magic word.

01:54:27.800 --> 01:54:28.200
Anyway.

01:54:28.840 --> 01:54:29.240
All right.

01:54:29.240 --> 01:54:30.120
That's it for calls.

01:54:30.120 --> 01:54:31.880
We didn't have anything else on the line.

01:54:31.880 --> 01:54:33.640
So we're about to wrap up.

01:54:33.640 --> 01:54:37.640
If there's no other last minute stories, I guess we're moving to wrap up for the night.

01:54:37.640 --> 01:54:40.840
But we will be back next week, except for Dark Sakura, sadly.

01:54:40.840 --> 01:54:44.600
But well, not too sad for us, but not that sad.

01:54:44.600 --> 01:54:49.080
Maybe he'll sing Jurassic Park is frightening in the dark.

01:54:49.080 --> 01:54:50.440
Are you doing meet and greet again or no?

01:54:50.440 --> 01:54:51.320
Because you already did that.

01:54:51.320 --> 01:54:53.880
Yeah, we did that for our 10th anniversary.

01:54:54.440 --> 01:54:58.760
So we're thinking next year of putting the money aside and going to Disney World.

01:54:59.560 --> 01:55:00.680
That'll be fun.

01:55:00.680 --> 01:55:02.520
I've never been to Disney World and I really want to go.

01:55:02.520 --> 01:55:04.600
But we're doing we're doing the Star Trek Cruise next year.

01:55:05.320 --> 01:55:07.800
Thanks to I almost said it.

01:55:07.800 --> 01:55:10.040
I always call him by his last name and I got to stop doing that.

01:55:10.040 --> 01:55:14.280
But thanks to Grandpa or Captain Matt from Starboard Power Company.

01:55:15.320 --> 01:55:18.040
We're going on that cruise and they just announced over the weekend because there's

01:55:18.040 --> 01:55:20.600
been a big Star Trek convention going on in Las Vegas this weekend, too.

01:55:20.600 --> 01:55:22.040
They just announced Jerry Ryan.

01:55:22.280 --> 01:55:23.400
Sarah was there.

01:55:23.400 --> 01:55:23.880
That's right.

01:55:23.880 --> 01:55:24.840
Tara was there.

01:55:24.840 --> 01:55:25.000
Yeah.

01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:26.440
But Jerry Ryan is going to be on the cruise.

01:55:26.440 --> 01:55:29.080
So trailer I did.

01:55:29.080 --> 01:55:29.720
Oh, my God.

01:55:29.720 --> 01:55:30.920
It looks so good.

01:55:30.920 --> 01:55:31.640
Right.

01:55:31.640 --> 01:55:32.360
I'm so far behind.

01:55:32.360 --> 01:55:34.200
I still haven't watched season two of Discovery.

01:55:34.200 --> 01:55:38.680
And I think I think I had the big twist spoiled for me and I'm a little irritated, but I'm

01:55:38.680 --> 01:55:39.400
still going to watch it.

01:55:40.120 --> 01:55:41.640
I haven't watched any Discovery.

01:55:41.640 --> 01:55:48.360
But I mean, the thing is, is that I had read like all of the like the big end book with

01:55:48.360 --> 01:55:49.560
the Borg and all that.

01:55:49.640 --> 01:55:55.800
And so part of my brain's going like thinking of book continuity and I'll go, no, no, no,

01:55:55.800 --> 01:55:55.960
no.

01:55:55.960 --> 01:56:00.280
Think different, not book, because I read through that going through the Deep Space

01:56:00.280 --> 01:56:02.280
Nine books because I love the Deep Space Nine books.

01:56:02.920 --> 01:56:03.160
Yeah.

01:56:03.720 --> 01:56:06.680
DS9 is the best Star Trek series and you're all wrong if you think otherwise.

01:56:08.680 --> 01:56:12.920
I'm near and dear to Voyager, but that's just because I think that's just more like an emotional

01:56:12.920 --> 01:56:14.920
connection, not based in like fact.

01:56:14.920 --> 01:56:15.560
Do you know what I mean?

01:56:16.200 --> 01:56:16.840
Yeah.

01:56:16.840 --> 01:56:26.360
But, you know, we would call Cisco a captain named Hawk because Avery Brooks was in A Man

01:56:26.360 --> 01:56:26.840
Called Hawk.

01:56:27.960 --> 01:56:30.360
So Questbuster says DS9 is great.

01:56:30.360 --> 01:56:32.600
Under the Pale Moonlight is one of my favorite episodes.

01:56:33.640 --> 01:56:34.520
Such a good episode.

01:56:34.520 --> 01:56:35.480
You're in good company.

01:56:35.480 --> 01:56:37.000
It's a fake.

01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:39.240
Anyway, we'll be back next week.

01:56:39.240 --> 01:56:42.520
Loki and I'll be back next week to entertain you with the week in gaming news.

01:56:42.520 --> 01:56:44.040
We hope you guys will all be here too.

01:56:44.040 --> 01:56:47.720
Bobby Blackall will be back next week live at Twitch to talk about Gen Con.

01:56:47.720 --> 01:56:48.920
So we're going to have a good old time.

01:56:49.960 --> 01:56:53.080
Whether you're here or not, maybe we'll get treated to a phone call, depending on how

01:56:53.080 --> 01:56:53.880
late the concert runs.

01:56:55.160 --> 01:56:57.080
Anyway, well, Dark Soccer.

01:56:57.080 --> 01:57:01.000
Oh, before we get to the final thoughts, as I always say towards the end of the show,

01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:02.520
hey, tell a friend or two about the show.

01:57:02.520 --> 01:57:03.560
Help us spread the word.

01:57:03.560 --> 01:57:07.560
We are the show where every gamer has a voice, but only if the voices are here to put out

01:57:07.560 --> 01:57:08.280
over the air.

01:57:08.280 --> 01:57:11.320
So yeah, be sure to bring those voices to us.

01:57:11.320 --> 01:57:15.080
A nice five star review on a place like iTunes or wherever you found this podcast.

01:57:15.080 --> 01:57:20.200
That goes a long way and also really, really helps the hosts on Twitch.

01:57:20.200 --> 01:57:23.880
Thank you so much to everybody that's put VOG Network in your auto host list.

01:57:24.760 --> 01:57:27.240
Dark Soccer, do you want to start us off with final thoughts tonight?

01:57:27.960 --> 01:57:29.480
Stop killing people, you twat.

01:57:31.240 --> 01:57:35.960
My final thought tonight would be I've really missed streaming on my personal channel,

01:57:35.960 --> 01:57:39.720
but with the Survivor game wrapping up, either I'll get voted out this week or it'll be done

01:57:39.720 --> 01:57:40.280
on Sunday.

01:57:40.920 --> 01:57:44.840
Either way, I should be back to streaming very soon because I want to make sure I build that

01:57:44.840 --> 01:57:49.000
up in advance of Dragon Con with all the streaming stuff that's going to be happening at Dragon

01:57:49.000 --> 01:57:49.240
Con.

01:57:49.240 --> 01:57:50.360
I'm really excited about that.

01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:52.840
Loki, last but not least, your final thoughts?

01:57:52.840 --> 01:57:55.240
I guess I have a course the right in Unity.

01:57:58.120 --> 01:57:59.160
Good luck.

01:57:59.160 --> 01:57:59.880
Good luck.

01:57:59.880 --> 01:58:01.480
We'll be back in seven days.

01:58:01.480 --> 01:58:05.000
Tune in then to find out if Loki was successful in doing any coursing.

01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:07.240
Oh yeah, like we'll know by next week.

01:58:07.240 --> 01:58:07.880
Come on.

01:58:07.880 --> 01:58:08.360
Yeah, right.

01:58:08.360 --> 01:58:09.240
Let's be honest here.

01:58:09.640 --> 01:58:10.680
Have a good week, everybody.

01:58:10.680 --> 01:58:11.320
Happy gaming.

01:58:11.320 --> 01:58:11.800
Good night.

01:58:39.240 --> 01:58:39.800
True.

01:58:42.600 --> 01:58:43.800
See you next week.

01:59:09.240 --> 01:59:10.380
Bye.
