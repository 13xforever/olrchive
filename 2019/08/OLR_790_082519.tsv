0	17480	This week, how do you turn a retail business into a business for the future?
17480	20360	By laying off all the people that can help you accomplish it, apparently.
20360	22520	Our best wishes to those impacted by this news.
22520	25200	This is just one headline, stay tuned for the rest of the week's gaming news starting
25200	28280	right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.
28280	37160	Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of Orange
37160	42940	Lounge Radio, the show where every gamer has a voice, not live, on this lovely Sunday evening
42940	45880	with episode number 790 of our show.
45880	49620	But I'll explain a little bit more on that in a moment, but we still have some things
49620	54480	to go over, some news to discuss, some video games to play, gaming culture to cover, all
54480	55480	that good stuff.
55480	61100	Myself, Rob Roberts, joining you here on Twitch TV, twitch.tv slash vog network where
61100	66280	we do broadcast, usually live, every Sunday night at 6 Pacific, 9 Eastern, although this
66280	69280	week has been prior recorded earlier in the week.
69280	72640	But it's going to feel like a little bit of a normal show, but maybe a little shorter
72640	76720	because it's already kind of late on a Thursday night here in Studio N7.
76720	80560	But joining me here on video for the show this week is Techmaster Loki.
80560	81560	Hello, I'm here.
81560	82560	Hi, how are you?
82560	84020	I'm full now.
84020	85740	That was some bomb ass chicken that you brought to the show.
85740	86740	It was some bomb ass chicken.
86740	87740	It's a bummer.
87740	93180	It took me a while to get set up for the pre-recording thing because that was some good chicken.
93180	94340	It was.
94340	96860	It was a Korean chicken, Korean grilled chicken?
96860	101420	It's supposed to be like Korean oven roasted chicken or oven, they also have fried chicken
101420	107980	as well, but it's like that one was a garlic chicken, which was garlic soy sauce and honey
107980	108980	or something.
108980	111580	But, oh my God, it was so good.
111580	113180	Like I'm already wanting to go back.
113220	114220	All right, it smelled good.
114220	117140	And I think Mr. Smoosh is going crazy over there about it too.
117140	122460	You might see Mr. Smoosh cameo on cam tonight because there's an empty chair across there
122460	126900	because she's not here in studio tonight, Dark Soccer or Jamie Summers.
126900	131460	But thanks to the magic of the internet, she's joining us, as they say on the news, via satellite.
131460	133180	Dark Soccer, are you there?
133180	137020	I can't believe y'all haven't had Korean fried chicken before because that stuff is bomb.
137020	140940	I feel like I had it once, but it was a long time ago, but-
140940	143020	Did I ever take you to Bonchon?
143020	144780	I don't think I've been to Bonchon.
144780	146780	I know there's like, it's a chain now.
146780	148300	There's like a couple of those around.
148300	152460	No, the fried chicken I was all about recently was the halal fried chicken.
152460	153460	That's pretty good.
153460	155340	Oh man, that stuff is good.
155340	160180	If their fried chicken is, I don't know, this chicken is pretty good, so I do need to try
160180	161180	their fried chicken.
161180	162180	I'm excited.
162180	163180	Both of you.
163180	165740	And the Popeye's new chicken sandwich that I hear is really awesome.
165740	170740	I'm taking you both to Oakland and we are going to go to this hole in the wall called
170740	175540	OB town that has the best Korean fried chicken you will ever put in your mouth.
175540	178700	I am super excited for some KFC.
178700	180580	Korean fried chicken.
180580	181580	Real KFC.
181580	183100	It's a real KFC.
183100	184100	All right.
184100	186700	Dark Soccer, why are you joining us remote tonight?
186700	190220	I know we usually love to tape in the same room, but I heard you had a little accident.
190220	191320	Are you okay?
191320	192820	My face is broken.
192820	193820	Well-
193820	195220	Okay, so-
195220	198980	I said something out of the ordinary.
199540	205060	Yeah, so I fainted two days ago.
205060	206060	Okay, that's scary.
206060	207540	I'm a dick for making jokes.
207540	209540	I'm sorry to hear that.
209540	214740	Yeah, so basically I was standing, I had gotten up to go pee and then I went back to get that
214740	219860	free standing minute on my Apple Watch and I got a little dizzy.
219860	225140	Next thing I know, three minutes have passed, I'm on the ground and my face hurts.
225180	231060	I apparently fell and hit my face hard on my bedside table.
231060	236620	So I busted my lip, have some bone bruises on my chin and my cheekbone.
236620	242940	Thankfully, no concussion or if it was a concussion, it was really minor.
242940	248780	So I've been raging headaches for the past couple of days and so I was just like, I've
248780	254020	got a bad headache and I'd rather be at home than be driving a longer distance when my
254020	255420	head feels like this, so.
255420	257140	Yeah, no, totally understandable.
257140	261180	So we love to record in the same room and it's part of what makes our podcast special,
261180	266380	but sometimes things are going to happen and if you had a thing where you fell and hurt
266380	272220	your head, which by the way also happened to me, but it was maybe like four years ago,
272220	273420	I had a similar thing.
273420	277020	I think I was super dehydrated and I was in a very steamy room.
277020	281420	I was basically in the shower kind of enclosed and the fan in there is terrible and I fainted.
281420	285420	It was just like a thing out of the blue and I actually ended up chipping my front
285420	286420	tooth.
286420	289220	It was one of those things where I had to go to the dentist ASAP because I was freaking
289220	290220	out.
290220	291740	I was like, oh my God, my tooth is all chipped.
291740	298420	So thankfully, dentists know how to work miracles and I look fine now, but it's scary.
298420	305940	What happened too is I went and I did go to urgent care to get tested, make sure that
305940	314740	everything was okay and it was a combination of dehydration and possibly anemia.
314740	317560	So I'm drinking Pedialyte.
317560	323860	It's disgusting, but I'm drinking it and just taking care of myself.
323860	327700	Well what an interesting segue because one of the first things I want to talk about here
327700	330660	at the top of the show is the Dragon Con hype.
330660	335300	So it's funny you bring up Pedialyte because that's a great way to stop a hangover and
335300	340140	there's going to be, well it is important to stay hydrated at Dragon Con and the reality
340140	345540	is there's a lot of, because it's in enclosed hotels throughout the Atlanta area, there's
345540	347460	a lot of alcohol consumption.
347460	351660	People are just openly, because you can open carry because it's indoors.
351660	354860	Usually you can't just open carry alcohol out on the street, but this convention is
354860	355940	now on the street.
355940	361260	So I think that's why it has a reputation for being such a, lots of libations and so
361260	362260	forth.
362260	366660	I mean, I'm not making it sound like it's a drunk party and if you're choosing to be
366660	368540	sober or what have you, you can't have fun.
368540	369540	I don't think that's true.
369540	372940	I think you can still, actually there was, I think it was last year, it was probably
372940	376940	just last year because there were so many panels that I was doing last year.
376940	381060	I didn't really want to drink because I had to get up early to do a bunch of panels.
381060	386380	So yeah, I didn't really indulge and I still had a great Dragon Con.
386380	391020	So yeah, Mr. Smoosh is making his presence known here.
391020	393660	If he keeps acting up off to put them in the other room.
393660	397420	Don't you, don't you know, we're trying, I know we're usually here on Sunday, but don't
397420	398420	you know, we're trying to do a show.
398420	401420	If you're going to yell, at least come over here and do it.
401420	407800	I think, I think he smells the KFC that was in here earlier anyway.
407800	411500	So I do want to say a big hello to anybody that may have discovered this show, thanks
411500	412500	to Dragon Con.
412500	417940	Cause I know I'm going to be selling the crap out of this show and other stuff that I work
417940	420920	on from several panels that I'm doing at Dragon Con.
420920	424720	So hello, hello to any new listeners and folks that may have discovered this show through
424720	425820	the convention.
425820	429400	It's going to be a little, little different tonight just because we did tape prior.
429400	434120	Usually we do tape live with folks in chat along with our show, we're able to do the
434120	435320	interaction and all that stuff.
435320	437100	We love doing this live.
437100	441880	But we wanted to record this week because if we don't record, then we'll miss two weeks
441880	443880	in a row and that's a long time to be gone.
443880	446760	So it's one thing to miss a Labor Day, but we didn't want to miss two weeks in a row
446760	449520	because I'm leaving really early this year because I'm going to be seeing a buddy of
449520	454080	mine in North Carolina and then making the six hour drive between the two.
454080	458760	But it's like, it's not like the six hour drive from here to LA where it's just like
458760	463560	cows and like dead grass the whole way.
463560	467200	Like I think the drive I'm going to be experiencing will be a lot better looking, at least that's
467200	468200	my hope.
468200	469200	That's my hope.
469200	470200	We'll see.
470200	471720	Well, Darsaka, you're from the South.
471720	475000	Like is it going to be a better road trip in that area you think?
475000	478240	It's going to be tall pine trees the entire way.
478240	479240	I like pine trees.
479240	480240	Okay.
480240	481240	Pine trees are nice.
481240	487960	It'll be very, very pretty at the start and then that'll be all you see.
487960	491320	Well the nice thing is- At least that's what it's like in Alabama.
491320	493920	The nice thing is I get to cross more states off my list.
493920	497760	I won't be going to Alabama, but I get to cross off North Carolina, never been there.
497760	500600	And then we drive through South Carolina on our way to Georgia.
500600	504000	So I'll get to cross off the, obviously I've been to Georgia a million times, thanks to
504000	507620	Dragon Con, but I'll get to cross off the other two Carolinas.
507980	509980	So that'll be good.
509980	515980	And then next year I have Florida that I get to cross off the list because of the crews
515980	520160	are going on in March with the kids from Starboard Power Couplings, that'll be fun.
520160	522920	So anyway, enough about my life.
522920	525260	Let's talk about video games and all that good stuff.
525260	528580	We're going to start off tonight with how is your gaming week and talk about the types
528580	531740	of video games that we have been playing this week.
531740	533020	Darsaka, how was your gaming week?
533020	537460	What have you- I know you had the fall, so maybe not much, but anything to help pass
537500	538500	the time maybe?
538500	544140	Sims, Animal Crossing on the phone, the usual.
544140	545140	More Sims, huh?
545140	546580	How's your family progressing?
546580	548620	Have you killed anyone yet?
548620	550660	I'm actually not playing really any of my families.
550660	555020	I only played like one group long enough for them to have a kid because they should have
555020	556020	a kid.
556020	562700	Because I mean, that's just, it was like an old RP character that I made a Sim for.
562700	569780	And then right now I'm remodeling all of the in-game Sims.
569780	572660	So that's really it.
572660	575820	The Goths right now are on the chopping block.
575820	579060	How many mods do you use with the Sims?
579060	582540	I'll tell you right now, and I'm actually going to be adding some more.
582540	587580	So if I go into my mods folder, because I am actually at my home computer right now.
587580	588580	That's Elder Scrolls.
588580	589580	Oops.
589580	596740	I'm actually, I'm going to probably be waiting, by the way, to do Final Fantasy XIV until
596740	602220	after we split our bills next month, Dan and I are going to be doing that.
602220	606460	So right now I have 17,639 installed and I'm going to be adding a few more.
606460	610780	Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, you have 17,000 mods for the Sims?
610780	615980	Well, right, because keep in mind, custom content is all considered a mod.
615980	617660	I think they're talking about like each individual piece.
617740	620940	Oh, so like if it's one shirt, that's a mod.
620940	621940	Exactly.
621940	622940	Oh, okay.
622940	625340	I mean, there are actual game mods.
625340	626340	Okay.
626340	634500	And like, I'm about to install four mods, like actual game mods, but those are scripts
634500	639080	and scripts go into like their own, like it's hard for me to track actually what scripts
639080	646260	I have on there just because, you know, they, goodness, I found some mods in the wrong folder,
646460	651020	but they go in like a different folder and I haven't been through that one to see exactly
651020	656260	how many I have, but I know like I have the, you know, the no mosaic, you know, so I can
656260	657260	have naked Sims.
657260	658260	Okay.
658260	659260	Yeah.
659260	663340	I was going to say, that's the only mod I need is the, the get rid of the blurs.
663340	665940	Isn't the one that makes them do nastier things too.
665940	666940	I'm almost positive.
666940	670260	I've seen a mod where like they do nastier things.
670260	671260	Possibly.
671260	677740	I mean, there's, there's like animation mods for the earlier ones.
677740	678740	Okay.
678740	683140	And I read an art article on Kotaku earlier this week that showed somebody with a large
683140	684140	dildo head.
684140	685740	So apparently there are mods out there like that.
685740	686740	Oh, I'm sure.
686740	687740	Of course there are.
687740	688740	Yeah.
688740	689740	If you can achieve it,
689740	698020	but I mean like you can get scripting mods and what those are, you know, once your, your
698020	702360	game is patched and everything's running fine, you know, there's only like a few things you
702360	703360	need to do.
703360	709420	And, and the company like EA Maxis, they're all like, they're super, like they know exactly
709420	710420	what to do.
710420	715060	You know, so they're perfectly fine with all of this running, you know, they just aren't
715060	721300	responsible for, you know, any of the shenanigans.
721300	725220	Any mod that tries to take your credit card number, shows your children something offensive.
725220	729860	It's like you install that you take the responsibility for that, but surely a company like EA has
729860	737020	to know, like modding is part of the reason why some of their games continue to succeed
737020	744100	for all this time afterwards, you know, because...
744100	745100	Go ahead.
745100	746100	I'm sorry.
746100	748220	One of the mods that I actually, it's a family of mods.
748220	752020	It's called don't wash dishes where you angry poop.
752020	753900	What?
753900	761780	Because you can, you can wash dishes in any sink and there's a habit where like your,
761780	770260	if your sim is closer to like a, a bathroom sink, then they'll try to wash dishes in that
770260	771260	sink.
771260	774380	Oh, I thought it was the other way around.
774380	777700	And there's also a don't prepare food where you angry poop.
777700	779780	I that's what mods called.
779780	784620	I thought you were about to say that if they couldn't find the toilet, they would just
784620	787500	poop in the sink.
787500	791020	And I was like, that's disturbing.
791020	795300	Like how drunk was your sim?
795300	803180	They make outdoor toilets though, that those outdoor toilets count as a bathroom, but you
803180	804780	can place them outside just in nature.
804780	807300	They're basically a giant plant.
807300	808300	All right.
808820	812700	Can you build like in this, I haven't played the Sims really since the first game, but
812700	817700	can you, can you build like outdoor homes, like, like tree houses now with porta potties
817700	818700	and stuff?
818700	819700	Yeah.
819700	820700	You always could do that.
820700	827820	Um, like, um, you know, there's some of the month or not mods, but some of the things
827820	835900	that I'll run are, um, like you can hit like, uh, control and the close bracket and it makes
835940	842780	things bigger and control, uh, open bracket is to make things smaller.
842780	843780	This is on a PC.
843780	846780	Um, cause my Mac doesn't have a big enough hard drive.
846780	853060	Um, but you can make things like huge or small.
853060	857020	And then, you know, there's another, uh, where you can, cause normally it doesn't let you
857020	861740	put things in certain places, but you can tell certain textures to not textures, but
861740	865260	certain objects to overlap.
865260	872060	And then you can, you know, make like, like plants growing out of your wall and like weird
872060	873060	stuff.
873060	876540	I guess that's a way you might decorate your house if you, you know, uh, have a lot of
876540	877540	money.
877540	883260	Uh, but I was going to say about the whole, I was going to say about the whole, um, modding
883260	884260	thing.
884260	887800	Like I'm trying to think like the, the one Sims game I don't think did very well was
887800	888800	the Sims online.
888800	890700	Remember when they tried to do the Sims online?
890700	894260	That one didn't do very well, but probably because you couldn't really mod that one because
894260	895260	it was always online.
895260	896260	Is that the Facebook one?
896260	897260	Yeah, no, no.
897260	902020	There was like, it was them trying to get on the MMO craze.
902020	906700	Like when everything started breaking through like world of Warcraft and, and, uh, uh, EverQuest
906700	910460	and all that stuff, they tried to do their own like MMO and it seemed, you know, it did
910460	913940	seem like a natural progression is that you could build, you know, your own Sims house
913940	915220	with other people.
915220	919940	But apparently the whole thing turned into, I feel like in the early days of OLR, we talked
919940	920940	about this.
920940	921940	That's pretty sure.
922940	931220	But like it just turned into a cesspool of like prostitution, drugs, like everything
931220	933780	that humanity, lawless humanity would turn into.
933780	935260	They built Second Life again.
935260	936260	Yeah, pretty much.
936260	937900	They built Second Life in the Sims online.
937900	940180	And that's why I think they third life.
940180	941180	Third life.
941180	942180	All right.
942180	945660	Darsaga, anything else for your game of the week?
945660	946660	Nah.
946660	947660	All right.
947660	949140	Then we'll move on to Loki.
949140	951380	Hey, we can hear you typing by the way.
951820	952820	So careful.
952820	954100	Uh, Loki, how was your TV week?
954100	957260	I didn't play a thing.
957260	958260	That's right.
958260	959260	Wow.
959260	960420	You've been really great with your track record.
960420	964020	I've been playing no games on this gaming podcast.
964020	970500	No, I have been working on coding and prepping for this coming week, which okay.
970500	974980	It's at least it's like adjacent, you know, you got to code a game to play a game, I guess.
974980	980740	So yeah, so I've been just working on getting stuff ready because I am going to participate
980740	982180	in a game jam next week.
982180	983180	Oh, wow.
983180	984180	Yes.
984180	989380	So I've been getting ready, um, to do that and I'm hoping to stream a lot of it too.
989380	990380	So we'll see.
990380	991380	What's the game jam is.
991380	992380	Oh, it's something you do at your house.
992380	995180	You're not going to go to a, uh, no, not going anywhere.
995180	996180	It's for a week.
996180	1000180	And so I have to work in the middle of that as well.
1000180	1003540	Um, but it's basically, it's a community game jam.
1003540	1007300	Um, it's a bunch of different YouTubers that are doing, putting it on.
1007300	1012580	So like some of the other ones I watch for like unity stuff like Braxis or Braxie.
1012580	1014660	And I don't remember the other guys putting it on here.
1014660	1017020	So let me just pull this up here real fast.
1017020	1020360	Um, but it's looks like it's pretty cool.
1020360	1025460	It's kind of laid back as far as you know what my expectations of it are going to be.
1025460	1028340	It's not like lunar dare or something like that.
1028340	1029980	Uh, okay.
1029980	1031660	So yeah, community game jam.
1031660	1038660	It's uh, it's IO, um, uh, slash jam slash, uh, C G J.
1038660	1046300	And it starts on Saturday at noon and it goes until August 31st at noon.
1046300	1050220	And yeah, so they have, it'd be a good way to spend the downtime with a week, week off
1050220	1051220	OLR.
1051220	1052220	Yeah, exactly.
1052220	1056160	So it'll be interesting to see, you know, what they're gonna, um, what the theme's going
1056160	1057160	to be.
1057160	1058740	You're going to let us play whatever you make.
1058740	1059740	Yeah.
1059820	1065820	I'm going to, I'm going to release something like, like, um, like they have on shop, you
1065820	1067460	know, put damn food on the plate.
1067460	1069100	You got to serve them something.
1069100	1070100	I like it.
1070100	1071100	Yes.
1071100	1072100	Put the, put the food on the plate.
1072100	1073100	Yeah.
1073100	1077260	So yeah, it's being put on by a, it's organized by a Blackthorn prod, Braxis, uh, Danny and
1077260	1082960	Jerry, uh, Jerry's sky, Lou and, uh, some other folks.
1082960	1086820	So it's a bunch of, it's like a big community of people that do like game development videos
1086820	1087820	on YouTube.
1087900	1089500	Is this something we can put on VoG network?
1089500	1092980	Like some of the, you remember we had that game jam a long time ago and some of those
1092980	1093980	was, they're still there.
1093980	1096740	It's some of those winning games or, well, they all won, but the VoG network, we had
1096740	1098340	some of the games that are playable.
1098340	1101340	Um, is it something that you can put there or maybe, I don't know.
1101340	1102340	I, uh, yes.
1102340	1104820	I mean, those games are there.
1104820	1107980	You have to talk to Bobby about the technical stuff, but yeah, I mean, I think it's going
1107980	1113180	to be hosted probably on itch.io, but it should be playable there.
1113180	1115660	I mean, we can make it available, I'm sure.
1115660	1121540	So I'm hoping that I can do it all right, but if not, you can watch me fail for a very
1121540	1122540	long time.
1122540	1124900	So we've been doing that for 17 years.
1124900	1125900	Yes, exactly.
1125900	1126900	So even more.
1126900	1127900	All right.
1127900	1130500	No, we're learning opportunity.
1130500	1131500	That's right.
1131500	1132500	It's a learning opportunity.
1132500	1133500	We're rooting for you.
1133500	1134500	This is good.
1134500	1135860	This would be a good thing for your kids to see you do when they're getting into pro or
1135860	1137460	at least Josh is getting into programming.
1137460	1138460	Yeah, that's cool.
1138460	1142380	I may take a couple of days off during the week, but you know, you earned more time.
1142380	1143380	You deserve it.
1143380	1144380	All right.
1144580	1145580	My gaming week.
1145580	1149260	So, um, I've kind of played a lot, I mean, we're, we're an abbreviated week this week
1149260	1152860	because we're recording a little earlier, but, um, I have still been continuing to play
1152860	1155300	Final Fantasy 14, doing some of the end game stuff.
1155300	1157980	Uh, Shane made me do some of the new raids.
1157980	1160820	So I actually played like w w we live streamed everything.
1160820	1164020	I've been trying to be really good about doing more live streaming on my personal channel
1164020	1165120	at Rob Roberts.
1165120	1169100	So, um, I played some Final Fantasy 14 with Shane the other night and probably the other
1169100	1172340	game I played, that's a little newer, at least new to me.
1172380	1176420	I played No Man's Sky on PC because remember I bought the PC version.
1176420	1177420	I bought it.
1177420	1179660	I haven't installed it yet, but I did buy it.
1179660	1183140	You double dipped, Bobby Blackwolf double dipped, like everybody's double dipping on
1183140	1184140	No Man's Sky now.
1184140	1185140	It's great.
1185140	1186140	Because mods.
1186140	1187140	Not yet.
1187140	1192160	Nope, it's not going to happen because it's easier for me to play on my computer than
1192160	1194380	with a controller.
1194380	1195380	That's yeah.
1195380	1200420	I, I kind of just wish I'd bought it on PC the first time, but I mean, it was a couple
1200420	1201420	of years.
1201500	1202820	It was originally a PlayStation four game.
1202820	1205300	So I mean, that wasn't exactly possible.
1205300	1209260	So, but like obviously with PC, I can play in 2k mode.
1209260	1214920	I have to really dumb down the graphics, especially if I'm streaming, but like it's, it's doable,
1214920	1215920	you know?
1215920	1217260	So that's, that's pretty cool.
1217260	1218260	All right.
1218260	1220240	And Mr. Smoosh is getting up on the soundboard.
1220240	1221240	That's a big no-no.
1221240	1228300	Loki buy me time or somebody that cat, I swear to God, it just is causing all sorts of trouble.
1228300	1230300	All because I didn't share the chicken with you.
1230300	1231300	Too bad.
1231300	1232300	I don't know.
1232300	1233300	Who does he think he is?
1233300	1237940	I finally heard back from discord by the way.
1237940	1239740	Gonna change all the switches and all that stuff.
1239740	1242020	Oh, cause you got locked out of your other account, right?
1242020	1243020	Yeah.
1243020	1244980	So I have to delete my account and remake it.
1244980	1246260	Ah, what a pain.
1246260	1247260	All right.
1247260	1249180	Well, you're still with us at least here tonight.
1249180	1251700	So no man's sky, no man's sky on PC.
1251700	1252700	It's it's prettier.
1252700	1256580	Um, although obviously I have to like, especially if I'm streaming, I have to turn the graphics
1256580	1259380	way down or else like my computer's just like help.
1259380	1263540	Um, but when I'm not streaming, like it's, it's very lovely to look at.
1263540	1266940	Uh, the first planet I started on was some ice planet.
1266940	1271620	Like it was really, it was a really horrible place, but what I did, I rolled straight into
1271620	1273400	Alan's universe.
1273400	1278980	So like I joined his game, so it's put me on a planet in the system he was already in.
1278980	1283500	So I started there and we kind of noticed, and I think Bobby was there cause I was streaming
1283500	1286700	it live and he talked about how some of it is kind of scripted in the beginning.
1286700	1290900	Like you always, you know, at a certain time get like a severe storm that comes through
1290900	1294020	because it's teaching you how to replenish your life supply, you know, and there's certain
1294020	1296900	things that are like scripted to happen at the beginning, no matter what planet you're
1296900	1297900	on.
1297900	1298900	So it's kind of interesting to see.
1298900	1302420	Cause like, uh, when Alan came to the planet, he's like, I don't see this stuff because
1302420	1305260	you're being scripted through all this stuff right now.
1305260	1306820	Ah, so yeah.
1306820	1308820	So I guess maybe Alan was saying a lot of that.
1309300	1314900	But then eventually I made my way to the moon of that planet, which was lovely.
1314900	1318500	It was like one of those like purple grass planets and very serene.
1318500	1319620	It was very nice.
1319620	1321600	And that's where Alan's base is.
1321600	1326560	So I started a base, like I couldn't build right near his, but I was able to build like
1326560	1328400	on the other side of the mountain from it.
1328400	1331540	So now we have bases right near each other, but it won't let me upload it cause it says
1331540	1332860	it's too small.
1332860	1336780	So I have to expand it a little more still and then I should be able to upload it and
1336780	1339100	more people I guess could visit it if they wanted to.
1339100	1343220	But sadly I probably won't get a lot more time with No Man's Sky until after I'm back
1343220	1344220	for my trip.
1344220	1347340	But, uh, I was, you know, enjoying the experience on, on PC.
1347340	1350260	It's just getting used to the different controls was the hardest part.
1350260	1355620	Cause it's like all these keys like Q, W, E, R, you know, they're all mapped to different
1355620	1356620	things.
1356620	1358980	And so like, I'm not, Oh, I'm just going to play the controller.
1358980	1362140	So that'll, my brain wasn't used to, yeah, I guess I could just plug in my Xbox controller
1362140	1363700	or your PlayStation four controller.
1363700	1364700	I guess that's true.
1364700	1365700	I should just play with the controller.
1365700	1368100	That would make it a lot easier, but that's, that's okay.
1368100	1371780	I don't, you know, there is something about using the mouse to aim that I enjoy and all
1371780	1372780	that stuff.
1372780	1373780	So that is, that is nice.
1373780	1377060	So, um, yeah, that's pretty much been my gaming week.
1377060	1378340	I don't think a lot else to share.
1378340	1381060	Cause I talked about VR on No Man's Sky last week.
1381060	1382060	I'm pretty sure.
1382060	1384220	So I don't need to cover that again.
1384220	1389260	So, uh, we will move on with the program and in our next segment, we're gonna do something
1389260	1391940	a little special, a little different here tonight.
1391940	1395660	Something we, um, don't usually have as a segment in the show, but maybe we ought to
1395660	1399500	bring it back because we got a lot of great feedback this week.
1399500	1403140	Uh, what we wanted to invite with some of your questions and some of your discussion
1403140	1405580	drivers this week on Twitter.
1405580	1409940	So over at our Twitter account, uh, OLR, we asked a question this week.
1409940	1412840	We asked everybody to, uh, uh, answer the following.
1412840	1418380	We said on a special recorded OLR this week, we want to invite your questions for our hosts
1418380	1422780	on gaming, on podcasting or anything reasonable you might have.
1422780	1425960	So we got quite a few responses.
1425960	1428540	So we have a few questions and discussion topics for tonight.
1428540	1429540	So y'all ready?
1429540	1432620	You're ready for Ask Orange Lounge via Twitter?
1432620	1433620	Yes.
1433620	1435700	All right, let's do it.
1435700	1440060	Uh, first off tonight, our pal Flaco Jones.
1440060	1441060	Flaco Jones.
1441060	1443420	So I've seen, been doing a lot of streaming very late at night.
1443420	1447320	Uh, last, the other night he was playing some Paladins, I think, but hopefully that's all
1447320	1448560	going well for him.
1448560	1454260	So Flaco Jones starts us off saying, I know Loki was having Joy-Con drift.
1454260	1460220	Has he or any of the other hosts taken advantage of Nintendo's free repair for the issue?
1460220	1465960	I sent mine in and they took care of them quickly and at no charge plus free shipping.
1465960	1468720	So I haven't took advantage of the whole, I haven't yet.
1468720	1475240	Um, and I want to, I just haven't done it yet, but I need to do both sets, both Joy-Cons,
1475240	1477280	but I'll have to do one at a time.
1477280	1479860	And it's one of those things where they're going to be missing for a while while they're
1479860	1480860	getting repaired.
1480860	1481860	That's why I have two sets.
1481860	1486660	So like, so I would do one, have it repaired, it comes back and then do the second one.
1486660	1490500	But that's less bad because I only have the one set, but I was gonna say, I'm not having
1490500	1495500	the problems you guys are having, but admittedly mine gets less traffic.
1495500	1499500	I don't have the kid factor either, which I'm sure, you know, they tend to, you know,
1499500	1501700	put a little more wear and tear on them.
1501700	1506620	Um, and uh, yeah, so they haven't really been an issue for me yet, but I'm glad Nintendo
1506620	1508760	kind of, kind of came around on the program.
1508760	1511560	I, well, I think they were kind of forced to, or else they were going to be looking
1511560	1513200	at a class action lawsuit type of thing.
1513200	1517800	So I think they were kind of putting a quarter on that, having to do the warranty thing.
1517800	1521760	Uh, Dark Sakura, you, you haven't had a problem with your Switch at all, right?
1521760	1524200	So you're, you probably haven't taken advantage of this either, right?
1524200	1526880	Honestly, it's our Pro Controller that had more problems.
1526880	1528400	It's got some input lag in it.
1528400	1530240	I think just our model.
1530240	1531240	Interesting.
1531240	1536600	So the Pro Controller having issues, but they, it's not, it's just input lag.
1536600	1541580	And it had a little bit of drift on it too, but I haven't seen anything going on for
1541580	1542580	the Pro Controller.
1542580	1544260	So we have nothing to take advantage of.
1544260	1545260	Yeah, I know.
1545260	1547380	I was gonna say, I don't think that's part of the program yet.
1547380	1550460	Who knows if there's enough of those problems out there, who knows what'll happen?
1550460	1553140	Well, Dark Sakura, I bet this next question will be up your alley.
1553140	1560660	So our next tweet tonight is from Rettertainment who says, I have a Sega Saturn and one game
1560660	1562340	missed.
1562340	1564900	I've been thinking of getting another game.
1564900	1567900	What should I keep my eye out for?
1567900	1569840	What shouldn't you keep your eye out for?
1569840	1571920	Is it a US?
1571920	1574160	It's a US one, right?
1574160	1577880	It was not specified, so we're going to assume a US one.
1577880	1578880	Okay.
1578880	1586080	So US games, of course there's, if you're into fighting games, any of the Street Fighter,
1586080	1590040	King of Fighters, you know, those are all, well, actually the King of Fighters games
1590040	1592080	require the RAM cartridge.
1592100	1601100	So I would say, basically like Street Fighter Alpha 2, the first Street Fighter Alpha, if
1601100	1608180	you can get any of like the Sega Aegis stuff, those are pretty good.
1608180	1609660	There weren't too many of them that came out in the US.
1609660	1616440	Of course you want to have Knights, you want to have, gosh, I'm trying to think what else
1616440	1618860	is like, I'd have to go look at the vault now.
1618860	1621640	The Panzer Dragoon Zwee?
1621640	1629520	Panzer Dragoon Saga, actually it's expensive, but absolutely worth it.
1629520	1633120	We got ours like really cheap too, but yeah, the Panzer Dragoon games are worth it.
1633120	1637240	I mean, they're not like my absolute favorites, but they're good games.
1637240	1641480	Is the Sega Saturn hard to mod to play import games?
1641480	1645720	If you want to ask, you will have to ask your husband about that because I've never done
1645720	1646720	it.
1646720	1647720	Oh really?
1647720	1654220	I didn't even know Alan modded Sega Saturns, what?
1654220	1658020	I think we had his modded Sega Saturn for like a hot minute.
1658020	1662020	Honestly, it doesn't surprise me though, Alan was a Sega guy for a long time, so it doesn't
1662020	1664860	like surprise me, but it's just kind of funny.
1664860	1671500	I would have thought that you and Dan would have had the lock on that.
1671500	1676860	We had converter cartridges, so that's what we did.
1676860	1677860	Gotcha.
1677860	1682200	No, and the Saturn was one of those platforms I kind of missed out on, like I didn't catch
1682200	1686360	up with Sega really until like the Dreamcast, so all my Sega memories are with that, so
1686360	1689700	I don't have a lot to recommend.
1689700	1692320	I would have said the big stuff like Knights as well.
1692320	1697560	Well, like how you see, this was back in the days when I used to rent consoles from Blockbuster
1697560	1702220	because I didn't buy a Sega Saturn until much later, but I used to rent it with a stall.
1702220	1705400	That was another one of the games I liked in Clockwork Knight.
1705400	1708260	A stall was pretty good, but awfully slow.
1708260	1710500	Yeah, but it's pretty.
1710500	1712780	It had great music.
1712780	1718460	I find that interesting that of all the games in the world for the Sega Saturn, Retertainment
1718460	1723420	has missed, but I'm going to assume maybe it was like included or like a really good
1723420	1726980	deal because he doesn't say where the Sega Saturn came from, like if it was given to
1726980	1730660	him or if he found out like a flea market garage sale type of thing or what.
1730660	1736160	Yeah, so it's just interesting that of all the games, I mean, I'm not knocking missed.
1736160	1740160	Missed isn't a bad game, but I don't associate missed with the Saturn nearly as much as I
1740160	1746920	do like old MS-DOS PC because like that, you know, I feel like missed was only ported to
1746920	1752440	like the Saturn and all those consoles because of how it was performing on the PC, you know?
1752440	1753440	Yeah.
1753440	1754440	Anyway.
1754440	1755720	All right, let's move on.
1755720	1758160	Now we're getting into some deeper questions too.
1758160	1759160	This is good.
1759160	1765860	So Elliot Bentley, Elliot underscore Bentley sent us a tweet saying, what games have changed
1765860	1768340	the way you think of a certain genre?
1768340	1770680	It's a really good question.
1770680	1774140	What games have changed the way you think of a certain genre?
1774140	1777540	And even though I know we're not live tonight, I'm going to look through chat when this is
1777540	1778540	all done.
1778540	1781140	So I would be very curious because this is one I could see a lot of different answers
1781140	1782140	for.
1782140	1785340	Maybe we'll go back and read some of your answers next week, but anyway, or in two weeks
1785340	1786340	when we come back.
1786340	1787340	But here's an example.
1787520	1789640	B continues his tweet here.
1789640	1791000	Here's an example.
1791000	1797360	Since playing Breath of the Wild, I'm hyper aware of the way many open world games rely
1797360	1804360	on maps filled with icons and arrows pointing directly to your next destination.
1804360	1807720	So what games have changed the way you think of a certain genre?
1807720	1812160	So he's basically saying that like, because of the Breath of the Wild, like, oh, it made
1812160	1815880	me realize like all these open world games kind of have some of these like kind of base
1815880	1818220	elements that are very similar.
1818220	1821260	So what game changed the way you think of a certain genre?
1821260	1822980	None really.
1822980	1828220	I mean, I've always, I don't really look at games per genre really.
1828220	1833100	I look at every game to me is a different and unique experience.
1833100	1837300	So I wouldn't say that anything's changed the way I think about it because I go into
1837300	1839860	every game as their own experience.
1839860	1841860	That's just how I am.
1841860	1842860	That's fair.
1842860	1847200	Okay, so like an answer that comes to my mind is a game that we've stand forever on Orange
1847200	1851600	Ons Radio, which I bet a lot of you guys maybe haven't played yet, but you need to go find
1851600	1855220	a way to play this game, even if illegally, like I'm just going to be real, find the ROM
1855220	1856220	and download it.
1856220	1859880	Because if we've been robbed of this game for all these years, like they just they're
1859880	1861920	never going to put it out for you to get legally.
1861920	1863760	So you should just get it illegally at this point.
1863760	1864760	Sorry, not sorry.
1864760	1869420	And that is the Guardian Legend because my answer is like the Guardian Legend because
1869420	1876000	of the way it fused, like shooter and like overworld action, like the Zelda kind of element,
1876000	1881200	like I would say like the Guardian Legend really made me rethink the shooter genre,
1881200	1886880	because it was like it added this much deeper layer to it, where that the adventuring that
1886880	1893260	you were doing around the world was affecting, you know, what you did in the shooting part,
1893260	1897040	you know, and like it was it was a different type of shooter to like, I like the way the
1897040	1899260	two sides influenced each other.
1899260	1903320	And I think those type of mishmash genre games are going to always be the ones that come
1903320	1907600	to mind because you know, another one from back in the day, you ready for another obscure
1907600	1909240	NES title?
1909240	1911600	This was another genre fusing game.
1911600	1918040	And it fused again, like your Zelda type of overworld with a more traditional RPG.
1918040	1919680	And that is Magic of Scheherazade.
1919680	1923800	I don't know if you've ever played, have you ever played Magic of Scheherazade?
1923800	1925160	Like briefly?
1925160	1926160	Yeah.
1926460	1931020	You know, some of it, it's a little clunky in parts, because I think it's very ambitious
1931020	1933040	what they were trying to do with that game.
1933040	1938460	And I think that game in some ways makes you rethink RPGs.
1938460	1939940	I don't know, I could probably come up with more.
1939940	1942740	I don't know if you guys have anything to add to this.
1942740	1948160	Grant the thought of five and the amount of detail that developers can put into a game,
1948160	1952760	like the ridiculous amount of details that they have in there, like with pant legs getting
1952820	1958600	wet up to this point where they get into the water or like just all sorts of weird stuff,
1958600	1965140	flip flops flopping and just the animals and there's all sorts of like crazy details that
1965140	1966140	are in that.
1966140	1972260	So kind of like environmental, the environmental impact, not like climate change type of discussion,
1972260	1978740	but more like the environment, you know, physics and awareness with an action game, which is
1978740	1983040	interesting because you could also think like crackdown where you kind of take traditional
1983040	1985040	physics and kind of turn it on its head a little bit.
1985040	1986040	Yeah.
1986040	1987040	Way.
1987040	1990020	I think crackdown is kind of a genre bending game a little bit, a little bit because it
1990020	1994560	took the grand theft auto-esque type overworld mechanic, but made it like, but what if you
1994560	1997280	had anti-gravity boots type of things?
1997280	2001300	What if, you know, you could do all these different things or you could take the open
2001300	2006040	world grand theft auto type genre and what they did with like driver three and how your
2006040	2007400	game is so fucking buggy.
2007400	2010260	It just ignores a lot of the rules.
2010260	2013340	I love driver three because it was so terrible.
2013340	2014340	It was fun.
2014340	2018580	Are there other games maybe in that category, like a game that was so fucking bad, it made
2018580	2023820	you kind of rethink the genre a little bit, but it's like kind of fun in a charming way.
2023820	2027260	So bad spice world and music games.
2027260	2029300	Oh God.
2029300	2030300	That's right.
2030300	2031300	On the PlayStation one.
2031300	2035740	Let's put another girl through her paces spice world on PlayStation.
2036160	2039280	Totally not something that a pimp would say.
2039280	2044680	I was thinking in terms of open world though, going back to that, I mean Minecraft was pretty,
2044680	2045680	pretty crazy.
2045680	2046680	Oh, good call.
2046680	2047760	When it was new.
2047760	2048760	Good call.
2048760	2052920	Like a game that's open world, but it's your world.
2052920	2054160	Yeah.
2054160	2058200	That's definitely genre defined or like genre bending for sure.
2058740	2065540	But I'm not saying that anything really like, it's just that I don't look at the impact
2065540	2066540	like that.
2066540	2067540	Does that make sense?
2067540	2071060	Yeah, no, that's, that's why I kind of like a question like that because it does make
2071060	2072900	us kind of take a step back and go, huh.
2072900	2076540	I wonder what game has made me kind of like no man's sky.
2076540	2080740	Like how everything is procedural is kind of ridiculous.
2080740	2084300	That's another, that's another different type of like open worlds type of thing where what
2084300	2087340	if the world is just completely generated.
2087360	2090920	Or borderlands with the billions of guns that they have.
2090920	2091920	You know what though?
2091920	2095840	You know what though would be in a similar bucket with no man's sky would be, um, elder
2095840	2099700	scrolls two.
2099700	2103000	Was that the one that had the procedurally generated, like all the caves and everything?
2103000	2104320	Like they didn't go in there and design it.
2104320	2107680	Everything was like generated basically because the world was so fricking huge.
2107680	2108680	I think it was two.
2108680	2109720	It was either two or three.
2109720	2111120	I don't think, I don't think it was Morrowind though.
2111120	2112120	I think it was the second game.
2112120	2113120	I think it was, yeah.
2113120	2114120	The first one's arena.
2114120	2115120	The second one's blades.
2115120	2116120	Right.
2116120	2117120	I think it was that one.
2117900	2119900	Anyway, food for thought.
2119900	2124140	Anyway, I'm excited to see chat's answers on that too, and maybe some more tweets on
2124140	2125140	that, but great question.
2125140	2126140	Okay.
2126140	2131820	So our next tweet, as we get to some more listener questions tonight for our show, comes
2131820	2136460	from SSJ100 Matt who says, it's a three, it's a three part question.
2136460	2137460	You ready?
2137460	2138460	So here we go.
2138460	2139460	Part one.
2139460	2145420	Besides wearing pants, what has been the biggest challenge and adjustment you've all had to
2145420	2150400	make now that the show has a video aspect to it?
2150400	2151400	What's the big...
2151400	2152400	Wearing pants.
2152400	2153400	Kidding.
2153400	2154400	I, come on.
2154400	2156880	We all wore pants before because we were all in the same room.
2156880	2157880	Although...
2157880	2158880	Uh-uh.
2158880	2159880	Sometimes I wore a skirt.
2159880	2160880	I, yeah.
2160880	2164640	Well, and I was going to say, sometimes I'd be lazy and wear gym shorts, you know, and
2164640	2167400	like, I wouldn't bother to do my hair or wear a hat.
2167400	2171300	I just would look like shit because I'm like, well, nobody's going to see me, but Loki and
2171300	2172800	Dark Soccer, and they've known me forever.
2172800	2174320	They've seen me at my absolute worst.
2174320	2175320	So whatever.
2175320	2176900	Like you do think about that a little bit.
2176900	2180540	I definitely, I do have to think a little bit about like what I'm going to wear.
2180540	2183880	Like what's going to be like, and even to the point where I'm like, oh, I'm wearing
2183880	2188080	this cruel intention shirt that I got at Target on the stream tonight.
2188080	2191700	And I'm like, um, I think I wore this on the show like three weeks ago and I kind of like
2191700	2195100	didn't want to repeat it, but I was like, at the same time, it's like, you know, like
2195100	2198620	I kind of get into that mode where it's like, oh, I don't necessarily want to repeat outfits
2198620	2203740	either, but like, it's, it's just, you don't buy shirts to wear once and throw them away.
2203760	2206400	Like I, we don't live that kind of lifestyle.
2206400	2210600	It's hard to decide where to look because I have to look at the camera, talk to the
2210600	2216400	audience, look at Rob, it's like, ah, that is huge.
2216400	2220640	That is the biggest challenge because I remember after the first episode, uh, the first piece
2220640	2225320	of feedback I got from a friend was that like, you guys don't even look at each other when
2225320	2226760	you're doing the show.
2226760	2231480	And I'm like, no, we really don't like, because when it's a radio show, you don't see that.
2231500	2233620	And he's like, you guys are like always buried in your computers.
2233620	2237180	Like, and I'm like, well, we're pulling up the next story and you know, whatever.
2237180	2238540	He's like, you're on your phone half the time.
2238540	2240820	I'm like, well, I'm multitasking.
2240820	2243300	Well those Pokemon are going to catch themselves.
2243300	2247900	So, you know, so I would say that has been a big change is that we have to be aware,
2247900	2254140	you know, I mean, yeah, we said in the very beginning, we're still doing an audio podcast.
2254140	2256360	It's just the delivery method is different.
2256360	2258740	So we're not going to like turn it upside down for Twitch.
2258740	2260420	We're not suddenly doing orange launch video.
2260560	2265160	It is still orange launch radio, but certainly I don't want it to like look terrible.
2265160	2268800	So I think, you know, some of that feedback was still very right on is that, okay, I need
2268800	2273080	to not be on my phone unless it's like, you know, unless I'm bringing up tweets to talk
2273080	2277160	about on air or, you know, I need to try to like actually look at Loki or Dark Sakura,
2277160	2281600	which is here talking or the camera, you know, instead of like looking, you know, or like
2281600	2285280	taking a nap or like, I'm just going to rest my eyes while Loki does the next story.
2285280	2287320	Like, I can't really do that anymore.
2287320	2288320	You know?
2288320	2291060	I think that was a big change.
2291060	2293060	Anything for you, Dark Sakura?
2293060	2294060	No.
2294060	2298300	But you also, you tend to sit off cam too.
2298300	2299300	Yeah.
2299300	2301700	So it's not really super crazy for me.
2301700	2304900	I'm just doing my, my huge.
2304900	2305900	Yep.
2305900	2312380	Number two, what has been your favorite part about adding video to the show?
2312380	2324600	I couldn't say, I'll be honest, I kind of don't feel one way or another about it.
2324600	2325960	That's fair.
2325960	2331080	It's the, obviously the pre-show things that we have are hilarious.
2331080	2333800	The little bumpers that Jason and I do.
2333800	2334800	Yeah.
2334800	2335800	Yes.
2335800	2336800	Yeah.
2336800	2337800	Those are fun to do.
2337800	2338800	It's a little, little extra thing.
2338800	2343340	I would say, and you know, uh, when it's utilized, it's wonderful.
2343340	2347780	It's not, you know, I don't expect everything on this show is going to get clipped, but
2347780	2349980	I love the clip thing.
2349980	2354420	Like when we do have those random things that happen, we're like, let's say Mr. Smoosh makes
2354420	2357260	an appearance on cam or something and people, you know, want to see that.
2357260	2358620	So the clip happens.
2358620	2362100	But then the nice thing about the clipping is that then people who let's say they do
2362100	2366860	only listen to the audio podcast, but they heard that this funny thing was happening.
2366860	2368300	Somebody probably clipped it.
2368300	2371840	And so they can go onto the Twitch channel, you know, even though you have to be a subscriber
2371840	2375240	to see the full video archive, you don't have the clips are free.
2375240	2378620	So when people do clip things, you can just watch those whenever.
2378620	2382240	So I think for me, that's been my favorite part is the clip.
2382240	2387200	I think that's more of a, a nature of moving to Twitch specifically, cause like, you don't,
2387200	2389680	you can't clip on mixer or YouTube.
2389680	2394600	So then it is maybe video, but that's the best answer I got for your question.
2394600	2400140	Number three, what video improvements would you like to make or see happen?
2400140	2401660	More flashy effects.
2401660	2405640	I, I am going to make it a goal that when we come back from dragon con, we're going
2405640	2409860	to have some transitional bumpers because you guys will probably notice like our music
2409860	2411920	has been missing for a long time, right?
2411920	2415580	Like when we do the classic game of the week, we don't get the little doo doo doo doo doo
2415580	2418700	doo doo doo doo like the DDR Oha stop music that we were using forever.
2418700	2423220	We don't have that anymore, but I actually do want to bring those back with video bumpers.
2423220	2427960	So I'm trying to teach myself a new program to do those types of like animated bumpers
2427960	2431680	and hopefully those will come back soon, but don't hold me to it, but it's a goal for after
2431680	2437120	dragon con and maybe multiple camera angles and only because there was, was it that one
2437120	2442080	Twitch streamer on Twitter that we saw, Oh God, she's so funny.
2442080	2443080	Oh my God.
2443080	2444080	What is her name?
2444080	2449240	I followed her because when she reads these guys, cause trash bags will come into our
2449240	2454800	chat and say that, that kind of dumb shit that, you know, mouth breathers will say to
2454800	2458900	girl streamers and she will drag them through the mud.
2458900	2459900	It's pretty hilarious.
2459900	2461860	This is her multiple camera angles to do it.
2461860	2462860	Paladin Amber.
2462860	2464220	Shout out to Paladin Amber.
2464220	2465260	She doesn't need a shout out from us.
2465260	2468980	She's got 354 people watching her stream playing Minecraft right now.
2468980	2472660	She probably doesn't need our help, but I think she is hilarious and it's because of
2472660	2478340	clips that I got to, yeah, so yeah, the multiple camera angle stuff that that'd be great.
2478340	2482680	For me, like the number one thing I want to do, I want to change the whole layout.
2482680	2487560	Like like we had, we kind of took our old radio layout and just kind of made some small
2487560	2489680	adjustments, make it work for video.
2489680	2494320	There is a very good chance in the next year or so that the studio is going to move again.
2494320	2499120	Alan and I are looking at potentially moving again and next time the next space will be
2499120	2502500	designed with video in mind.
2502500	2506840	And I think that will go a long way in how this show is presented.
2506840	2515300	And someday, someday in the far future, we will have an orange lounge and actually, yes,
2515300	2519140	maybe perhaps, maybe after all that time, I'll get an orange cover for you to cover.
2519140	2520140	There you go.
2520140	2521140	You have our fricking orange lounge.
2521140	2526260	Um, I dark soccer, I know you're not as invested in the video part of it, but do you have something
2526260	2528740	that you think is an improvement you'd like to see happen?
2528740	2531100	Um, no, no, really.
2531100	2533540	I mean, so far things are pretty good.
2533540	2536620	I mean, I like the creative way things have been going.
2536620	2538000	I think it's actually pretty fun.
2538000	2543920	So, and then I get to randomly just put stuff up on the camera and do randomly, you know?
2543920	2544920	Yeah.
2544920	2548800	I think all of us had some app, some apprehensions in one way or another about the change because,
2548800	2550960	you know, change is scary.
2550960	2554560	The shout cast was comfortable, you know, it was gonna be sure for the listeners to
2554560	2559120	like, it's been a change, but like, you know, I, now that we're doing it, I am kind of kicking
2559120	2562580	myself a little bit going, God, we should have done it like three years sooner.
2562580	2566040	You know, we could have been more on the cutting edge of it, but it is what it is.
2566040	2571280	Like, I don't, no regrets, you know, when all is said and done.
2571280	2575800	The other thing, the other thing I just want to say about video improvements, more, I just,
2575800	2581760	there's not enough time to produce more B-roll, more things like more user created or out
2581760	2585820	in the road, out in the field, created segments, admittedly, I've been slacking on that a little
2585820	2586820	bit.
2586820	2588580	Like I've been trying to do some break segments, but.
2588580	2595580	Well maybe if I record a ton of footage this week, I can clip a best of thing together.
2595620	2600440	I'm still trying to do the laser tag stuff, but it's hard to do laser tag footage because
2600440	2601820	the footage is okay.
2601820	2607540	Um, I know now I'm not the talk over it when I'm recording, but their music is so goddamn
2607540	2611500	loud and it's just like, all audio can be stripped and replaced though.
2611500	2615900	It's very easy to strip out and you can hear the pew pew and the killing, but I guess I
2615900	2620180	gotta, I gotta record that and then dub it back in and it should actually just be you
2620180	2624660	going pew pew, laser beams, pew pew.
2624660	2626460	All right.
2626460	2631260	Bobby followed up, uh, SJ100 Matt's question, just wanting to chime in saying, by the way,
2631260	2635700	we're going to address some of these questions at our Dragon Con panel Saturday at two 30
2635700	2638700	because it's about taking your audio podcast and moving it to video.
2638700	2643140	Like we actually have a panel about this thing that we've done here at VOG Network, which
2643140	2644140	is really cool.
2644140	2648060	So that's going to be Saturday at two 30 PM and that is going to be live streamed on Twitch
2648060	2649980	at DC Digital Media.
2649980	2655360	Step one in your, you're taking your audio podcast into video is put the cat and isolate
2655360	2657180	the cat in a different part of the house.
2657180	2658180	Word of God.
2658180	2660020	That's where he's about to go in a minute.
2660020	2661020	All right.
2661020	2662460	Uh, let's go to another tweet here.
2662460	2669360	Dark Tetsuya with another tweet saying, going back on the president cat thing from last
2669360	2670900	week for a bit.
2670900	2676700	Did you know, apparently Jorudan, the company that was making it, got out of the game industry
2676700	2678200	some time ago.
2678200	2682200	So we may have to start hashtag save president cat.
2682200	2683620	What do you guys think?
2683620	2685800	So Jorudan got out of the game industry.
2685800	2690400	Well, if the game sold as bad as everybody said it did, I'm surprised they didn't get
2690400	2692040	out of the game industry a long time ago.
2692040	2695240	Maybe we can purchase the IP for president cat.
2695240	2696240	Holy shit.
2696240	2697240	That's the best idea.
2697240	2699360	Oh my God.
2699360	2703300	Now we have something we can spend all this bitty money on, right Bobby?
2703300	2709380	Can we spend all the subscription money on getting the rights to president cat?
2709380	2710380	You know what though?
2710380	2712380	I mean, think about it.
2712380	2720300	If we did do that and then we get our crack team of, uh, game designers who listen to
2720300	2725860	us all, what, three of them and no, I would, I would buy the rights to present.
2725860	2732700	I would buy the rights to president cat and give them, give them to Y Y R as a gift.
2732700	2736580	I was actually sort of thinking about doing like actual legit marketing on it.
2736580	2738560	They have produced so many hamster games.
2738560	2739560	It's ridiculous.
2739560	2740560	Really?
2740560	2741560	Yes.
2741560	2742560	All right.
2742560	2746180	Anything that's like actually been released in the States or like they all Japanese games?
2746180	2747540	Well, they did a vert.
2747540	2750980	They did the SNES version of alien versus predator game boy color.
2750980	2754020	They had bubble bubble classic and chase HQ, secret police.
2754020	2757020	So there's some stuff they do that come up as a Yogi bear game.
2757020	2761440	Oh, and so many hamster club games.
2761440	2769260	There's like one, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
2769260	2773760	Also the pets hamsters life too, cause obviously they're really, you know, they're good at
2773760	2775160	making hamster games.
2775160	2777100	That's what we've established here.
2777100	2780620	And to be fair, actually, as much as we're joking about buying the rights to president
2780620	2783800	cat, I actually don't think the rights were with that gaming company.
2783800	2789200	I think wasn't the character of Rena, like a comic or something like something that existed
2789200	2790720	on a TV parody.
2790720	2794760	Like I feel like that, that, that cat character actually existed somewhere else.
2794760	2797320	It's a mascot of a blog named Nico punch.
2797320	2798320	Okay.
2798320	2799320	So, so I go punch him.
2799320	2800320	I was kind of right.
2800320	2801800	I just didn't know it was a blog.
2801800	2802800	All right.
2802800	2807500	Well, we just licensed it from the blog then fair enough.
2807500	2808500	I bet.
2808500	2809500	I bet.
2809500	2811300	If we ask that guy from the blog is gone.
2811300	2816860	So I bet if we asked that guy very nicely from the Oh, Iraq studios that made cat president,
2816860	2819740	we can maybe buy his rights to cat president.
2819740	2820740	Probably a lot cheaper.
2820740	2821740	I don't know.
2821740	2822740	Yeah.
2822740	2823740	The Nico punch blog is gone.
2823740	2825880	Apparently they've disbanded after them.
2825880	2827380	Maybe the rights are available.
2827380	2828380	Stay tuned.
2828380	2829380	Stay tuned.
2829380	2830380	All right.
2830380	2831380	One more question.
2831380	2832380	We'll just make our own president cat.
2832380	2833380	You know what?
2833380	2834380	That's right.
2834380	2838140	I know it's not technically, technically we made president cat.
2838140	2842040	That game had a Japanese name that meant like boss cat.
2842040	2844620	We made president cat.
2844620	2850380	So therefore thusly, and I can just take a picture of Mr. Smoosh with a president cat
2850380	2851980	hat on like an Abe Lincoln hat.
2851980	2853700	And that can be president cat.
2853700	2857300	Yeah, but Midna would be queen cat.
2857300	2861420	Well, she, uh, uh, Midna can be secretary of milk.
2861420	2863680	No, she's the queen.
2863680	2866900	She's not nobody's secretary cause she's a girl cat.
2866900	2870100	No, I was thinking secretary of state like Hillary Clinton.
2870100	2871100	Come on.
2871100	2872100	All right.
2872100	2873100	All right.
2873100	2881780	Anyway, going on to our last tweet from, uh, the annual K it's D underscore annual K I
2881780	2888220	actually know Daniel K or as I call them on this show, the other DK, uh, so DK is a tweeting
2888220	2894700	us tonight saying, hi, hello, uh, what makes gaming so exciting for y'all?
2894700	2901020	I think that's a very blunt, direct, good question to remind us why we do this podcast.
2901020	2905640	What makes gaming exciting because it's been a part of my entire life and it would feel
2905640	2910980	weird not having it there be like missing the leg.
2910980	2911980	What do you think?
2911980	2913780	What makes gaming exciting for you?
2913780	2921940	Um, whenever I get a really good story, but it also has, um, like things in the world
2921940	2929140	that make it unique and special, like, you know, for example, having culture or its own
2929140	2940060	Conlang or, um, when they put thought into the sociology in the game.
2940060	2945620	So it's, it's the effort into the world when they build a world that excites me, then I
2945620	2948980	really want to learn everything I can about it.
2948980	2952660	You know, I could go all the way back with an answer to this, to when I was like first
2952660	2956660	gaming on the Atari 2,600 and part of what always drew me to video games was the fact
2956660	2959900	that I was controlling what was on the television.
2959900	2964100	You know, usually, you know, you would be watching cable, you'd be watching things that
2964100	2967020	somebody else made and is sending to your TV.
2967020	2970820	But when I played Atari 2,600 for the first time, it was playing a game like kaboom.
2970820	2974780	I was in control of those buckets, trying to catch the bombs that were dropping, you
2974780	2980240	know, and I was the one that would fail or succeed and have that kind of sense of accomplishment.
2980240	2981740	And so I think it's kind of like both those things.
2981740	2986800	I think it's like being able, being able to feel like you are part of the art.
2986800	2991740	You know, if we're to say that video games are art, which I do fully believe they are,
2991740	2995100	you know, movies are art, paintings are art, books are art.
2995100	2997940	But how often do you get to be a part of those?
2997940	3003020	I mean, I know there's always kind of like these kind of interesting genre bending things
3003020	3006700	like choose your own adventure books, let's say, they let you be a part of it, right?
3006700	3010140	But for the most part, you don't really get to be in those.
3010140	3014140	But with a video game and gaming, you get to be a part of that.
3014140	3015540	You're in control.
3015540	3018620	You're the one that's going to determine success or failure.
3018620	3024680	Whether that's a very simple, easy, repetitive type of Atari 2,600 old school game like kaboom
3024680	3029940	or something like that, or to something new and modern and very story driven like Mass
3029940	3030940	Effect.
3030940	3034520	You know, ultimately you're in the control of the choices and you're going to determine
3034520	3036760	what happens to the galaxy in a game like that.
3036760	3039780	Or even something very open world like Minecraft.
3039780	3044580	If you want to build a town full of houses shaped like penises, that is your prerogative.
3044580	3045580	That's your call.
3045580	3047100	You could do whatever you want.
3047100	3049140	And so I think it's kind of like those things.
3049140	3053140	The fact that you become part of the art, I think is what makes gaming exciting for
3053140	3054680	me.
3054680	3057140	We have a bonus question from The Other DK.
3057140	3058340	All right.
3058340	3059340	Bonus question.
3059340	3064980	What out there, in quotey fingers, what out there gaming concept do you think will be
3064980	3067540	released in the near future?
3067540	3073180	For example, flying cars or something completely outlandish.
3073180	3077380	What out there gaming concept do you think will be released in the near future?
3077380	3084980	Well, where my brain goes right off the bat is like HUDs, user display, right?
3084980	3090860	Like I think I almost feel like GPS and like navigation on something like Google Maps or
3090860	3097020	Apple Maps or something like GPS navigation in some ways I feel like is inspired by like
3097580	3101820	those genre of open world games where like the arrow points to your next destination.
3101820	3104500	Like I kind of feel like GPS is kind of that.
3104500	3107540	So my answer kind of takes that a step further.
3107540	3112460	And some of those other things that we do in video games with like, you know, and already
3112460	3116720	like, you know, if you drive a very modern car like a Tesla or something like I feel
3116720	3122180	like a lot of the way those navigate is like things that you've seen in gaming in a way.
3122180	3127980	Yeah, it's like you were saying, like AR stuff basically is kind of what we'll see
3127980	3132500	all sorts of weird implementations of that because they've already tried to do like some
3132500	3137460	sort of AR like like first person shooter games where they have like, you know, this
3137460	3142860	weird ass laser gun, like almost like laser tag, but with like your phone strapped to
3142860	3145860	it, which that's probably pretty lame.
3145860	3151580	But like I can imagine later on, like actually getting a good AR system where it just works
3151580	3154700	seamlessly wherever you go, then that could be pretty cool.
3154700	3157540	I think you're right on the money with like AR.
3157540	3161460	Like right now we think of AR like being used in things like Pokemon Go.
3161460	3162980	You know, it's very basic.
3162980	3164180	It is very basic.
3164180	3169300	But I could see that AR like imagine this now maybe AR in the future.
3169300	3174260	Like let's say you're having trouble building IKEA furniture like AR could like look at
3174260	3177780	what you've built and show you the next piece and where it goes.
3177780	3178780	It just says no.
3178780	3179780	Yes.
3179780	3180780	No.
3180980	3181980	This is all wrong.
3181980	3182980	All of this is wrong.
3182980	3185260	That little cartoon character with the X.
3185260	3186260	But you know what I mean?
3186260	3187340	Like like that type of.
3187340	3189340	And I think we've we've seen that already.
3189340	3194340	Like some very rudimentary versions of that would like placing pretend furniture in a
3194340	3198260	home to pretend what your house might look like if you lived in it.
3198260	3199260	And that type of thing.
3199260	3201700	So I think I think some of those AR gaming concepts, especially when it comes to your
3201700	3204260	mobile phone and through your phone, I think you're right on the money.
3204260	3208900	I think I think that is like a very valid, like realistic answer to this question.
3208900	3212500	That's the type of stuff we're seeing in gaming now that I bet will show up more and more
3212500	3217780	in the real world that AR and being able to, you know, pretend that things are there and
3217780	3221260	help walk you through those types of things I think is going to continue to grow and be
3221260	3222260	huge.
3222260	3224260	Jamie, I don't want to leave you out of an answer, though.
3224260	3228900	What what kind of like out there concept from gaming do you think will be a technology we
3228900	3231460	all use in our daily lives?
3231460	3236460	I'm thinking I mean, this might sound stupid, but we've been talking about like the whole
3236460	3237460	holodeck thing.
3238020	3244500	And, you know, they already have those holographic keyboards.
3244500	3250060	Could you imagine like having sort of like a holo pad or something that would bring up
3250060	3257020	things like interactive displays and you're kind of like almost like having your Wii U
3257020	3258340	screen in hand?
3258340	3259340	Yeah.
3259340	3265900	But instead you have like a holographic HUD or a maybe something that uses AR on your
3265900	3266900	phone?
3267340	3270340	Or haptics.
3270340	3272020	No, I know.
3272020	3276060	I know we always joke that like with each generation of gaming, we're getting one step
3276060	3277420	closer to the holodeck.
3277420	3278420	But it's true.
3278420	3279420	Right.
3279420	3284100	And especially now that things like VR and AR are becoming more and more like, you know,
3284100	3288420	sure, you still have to put on this giant headset to really, truly experience, you know,
3288420	3289420	VR.
3289420	3291300	Like, I remember like we were like, think about that, like in the 90s.
3291300	3294660	And it's like, oh, that's kind of cool and everything, but like, it'll never happen.
3294660	3297420	You know, and now it's just like kind of, well, and then that technology is going to
3297420	3303260	get more and more light, like, you know, VHS tapes were bulky and now everything is like
3303260	3304260	digital.
3304260	3307580	And so, you know, it's, there's going to come a time when that technology is not so bulky
3307580	3312460	and things like, I know we, Google Glass did not do so well.
3312460	3316420	Everybody always joked about glass holes and things like that, but I think there is going
3316420	3320860	to come a time when like you're wearing glasses and the glasses already have it.
3320860	3326180	There's North, which is a new, there's like $600 glasses.
3326180	3328600	They were actually selling them last weekend at Intel.
3328600	3331540	They have their pop up shop, but they have like two in the United, one in the United
3331540	3333460	States and one in Canada.
3333460	3335220	But like they're $600 glasses.
3335220	3339340	All they do is like, they show like notifications on your glasses, but it's, it's like projected
3339340	3345060	on there and you can see like everything and I wanted it.
3345060	3349620	It's complete garbage, like for $600, like I don't need to be spending it, but it's neat
3349620	3350620	and I want it.
3350620	3351620	So, yeah.
3351620	3356560	And you know, what's funny is that our pal Bobby Black Wolf is doing that panel.
3356560	3358900	So Bobby got on three tracks this year.
3358900	3359900	We were all excited.
3359900	3362620	Last year we were on two tracks, digital media and video games.
3362620	3364060	Dude, Bobby got on the third.
3364060	3368820	He's on the Star Trek track this year because they actually do a panel every year.
3368820	3370380	That's like update.
3370380	3372860	How much closer is the holodeck to being a reality?
3372860	3373860	Oh yes.
3373860	3378340	Cause you know, he does a lot with VR, not just as a, as a hobbyist.
3378380	3383180	So, uh, he's on that panel this year and I'm actually, I'm excited to check it out personally
3383180	3387500	and uh, it's a bummer you don't go to Dragon Con dark soccer cause I bet you'd get a kick
3387500	3388500	out of that panel too.
3388500	3391460	Want to pay for my ticket?
3391460	3394140	Well, I'm, I'm, I'm not that rich sadly.
3394140	3397100	I didn't win a million dollars playing survivor unfortunately.
3397100	3400460	Um, I got a blanket so I don't have a lot of money to share.
3400460	3401860	All right.
3401860	3402860	Anyway.
3402860	3403860	All right.
3403860	3405760	Well that, those were some great questions.
3405760	3406760	Thank you guys so much.
3406760	3411680	I, I feel like we might have to incorporate Twitter questions more often into the show.
3411680	3413880	Um, just because we get good stuff on there.
3413880	3418080	So no, we haven't played any games recently on the show.
3418080	3422520	I know we haven't cause um, I think ever since we switched to video, we kind of left those
3422520	3423520	by the wayside.
3423520	3428640	But um, I think there was talk about using Twitch extensions to bring some of that functionality
3428640	3429640	back.
3429640	3433560	I don't want to say too much cause I don't know what, I don't remember what Bobby told
3433560	3434560	me.
3434560	3436360	He can't, he can't do, but they are things we're thinking about.
3436360	3437920	But yeah, we haven't done any of the games in a while.
3437920	3439600	We need to bring some of the game shows back.
3439600	3442400	So anyway, um, great questions.
3442400	3443400	Yay.
3443400	3445000	Uh, let's take a trip down memory lane.
3445000	3449680	Uh, every week dark Sakura jumps into the gaming vault and finds the game that she thinks,
3449680	3455160	Hey, you guys should put, put your Google glass down and uh, check out this.
3455160	3461080	You have to, you have to boot this and Ms. Doss, you're going to type C colon backslash.
3461080	3462960	Then you're going to type CDs space.
3462960	3463960	All right.
3463960	3464960	Dark soccer.
3464960	3467360	That's actually being very literal cause I know what she picked for tonight.
3467360	3470080	So that is the type of way you would have to boot this game, right?
3470080	3471080	Dark soccer.
3471080	3473340	What did you pick tonight for the classic game of the week?
3473340	3480680	I picked jazz Jack rabbit developed and published by Epic mega games.
3480680	3491880	It came out in 1994 it came out for PCs operating Doss later on there were Mac and windows versions.
3491880	3505440	So this would be like windows 3.1 or one one if you were a networker or windows 95
3505440	3510200	if you were to afford the newest operating system at the time, but yeah, at any, at any
3510200	3516000	rate the game is set in the world based on the tortoise and the hare.
3516000	3522520	So, but it has the, the hatred between the tortoises and the hares have still gone on
3522520	3525040	for 3000 years.
3525040	3529480	There's an evil tortoise named Devin shell who started conquering planets and doing just
3529480	3531540	general evil things.
3531540	3540840	And one of the planets named Cara Tuss, uh, had a peaceful hair kingdom and then was,
3540840	3548240	you know, eventually, um, you know, was able to starve off the, uh, the tortoises attacking
3548240	3550680	and then they kidnapped their princess.
3550680	3558920	So of course, because we have the female character only exists to serve as a tag.
3558920	3563800	So anyway, we have just Jack rabbit who has to go rescue the princess and he has a light,
3563800	3570000	uh, sorry, a blue gun that he goes around shooting things.
3570000	3574080	He wears a red bandana cause it was the nineties and that's edgy.
3574080	3575760	He's also bright green.
3575760	3584340	And so, um, basically it is, uh, some, uh, platforming, um, you basically go around jumping
3584340	3585380	on shit.
3585380	3586680	You can shoot shit.
3586680	3593600	You can run fast, jump higher the longer that you run kind of Sonic-y, um, but in no way
3593600	3596960	there's inspiration from Sonic in this.
3596960	3606440	Funny you mentioned that it was actually inspired by Zool for the Amiga, but you know, no one
3606440	3609840	has original ideas since, you know, 1982 anyway.
3609840	3617000	So at any rate, um, you've got like, you can get a hoverboard and you can get like, uh,
3617000	3623440	force fields and a sidekick bird and different speeds up and invincibilities, extra lives,
3623440	3624440	all kinds of stuff like that.
3624440	3632440	You can get TNT, get big containers of ammo, but it has like no abysses, like no holes.
3632440	3635440	So you just keep going, you can't die by falling.
3635440	3641440	Um, so as it goes, so the game's divided into six episodes and each episode has three planets
3641440	3644880	and worlds and every planet has two levels.
3644880	3649920	Um, sometimes they have an additional secret level and then, uh, the final level of every
3649920	3652200	episode has a boss fight.
3652200	3660800	Um, and I think it's like, uh, unlimited continues, I think it's been an agent, I've played it,
3660800	3670040	but at any rate, um, it was, uh, you know, inspired by the game Zool for the Amiga and,
3670040	3675720	um, and it was driven by the success of other classics like Sonic the Hedgehog and the Mega
3675720	3678440	Man series that kept it going on.
3678440	3686720	And it was though considered to be, they thought that it was a, uh, a pastiche, which is a
3686720	3690720	type of visual reference.
3690720	3698600	One that celebrates, um, Sonic the Hedgehog, but it wasn't quite, you know, that really
3698600	3699600	wasn't what it was.
3699600	3701440	It was more like it was derived from Zool.
3701440	3706560	Um, it also had interactive music called Cyber Sound Music System.
3707040	3711960	Um, it did get a CD version that had the original six episodes and three additional ones called
3711960	3713920	the Lost Episodes.
3713920	3718800	Um, and then it had an episode with Jazz as a lizard.
3718800	3725080	And then there was a shareware edition that had just a special three level themed episode
3725080	3727120	called Holiday Hair.
3727120	3731680	Um, this was, uh, from Jack Jazz Rabbit, uh, Jazz Jack Rabbit CD.
3731680	3737040	Um, and then there were other like shareware holiday versions.
3737040	3742360	And of course then in 1988, there was a sequel and a reboot on Game Boy Advance and then
3742360	3753520	a Kickstarter, um, done by one of the co-creators, Cliff Bleszinski, who, uh, actually was later
3753520	3758020	on one of the forces in Epic Games' Unreal in Gears of War.
3758020	3761080	So we have some tie-ins to current things.
3761080	3769240	And of course you can get this on, you know, on other, like, I think it's on GOG and other
3769240	3774480	stuff so you can still get the game today.
3774480	3776600	So go play it is what you're saying.
3776600	3777600	Eh.
3777600	3778600	Or not.
3778600	3785280	I'll be honest, I was into it for a hot minute when it was like new, but at the time I wasn't
3785280	3788920	really so much a fan of playing games on the PC, you know?
3788920	3793120	Like my MMO was Gemstone.
3793120	3798880	You know, I would play like the point and clicks, but an action game like that, it wasn't
3798880	3803280	really my, my, my, uh, uh, you know, bottle of vodka.
3803280	3804280	All right.
3804280	3806280	Well, there it is anyway, your classic game of the week.
3806280	3807680	And it's one I play.
3807680	3811760	I probably played Jill of the Jungle more, but I still enjoyed some Jazz Jack Rabbit.
3811760	3812760	That's for sure.
3812760	3817240	So, I mean, go play it, you know, learn some of the roots of your games.
3817240	3824040	You know, it's one of those niche appreciation type games that had big appreciation in its
3824040	3825040	niche.
3825040	3826040	Yeah.
3826040	3827040	And you know, yeah.
3827040	3829040	And you know, again, cause I don't want to make it sound like we're, we're negative on
3829040	3830040	this game.
3830040	3833520	We're not, not whatsoever because like this game, I think you didn't really have a lot
3833520	3835480	of like platformers on the PC.
3835480	3838860	You didn't think of like platforming games, like this was the type of game you would expect
3838860	3842760	to see on a Super Nintendo, but instead you got to play it on your PC and that wasn't
3842760	3843760	very common.
3843760	3846520	And I think that's something very important to realize about, you know, the nineties when
3846520	3850760	this was out is that seeing these types of platforming games on the PC, especially as
3850760	3854000	well-rounded as this, not super common.
3854000	3859480	So it really felt like, yeah, you were playing something like a Super Nintendo game, but
3859480	3862120	on your PC and that was pretty rad.
3862120	3866900	And also, you know, there's many people now that think Epic is just the Fortnite company,
3866900	3872200	but in reality they've had a huge history in gaming and shareware.
3872200	3873200	That's right.
3873200	3874200	And shareware.
3874200	3875200	That's also very important.
3875200	3876200	So there it is.
3876200	3878720	Your classic game of the week, Jazz Jackrabbits.
3878720	3883120	I'm surprised they have a remaster, didn't they do like an HD remaster of it or something?
3883120	3886040	But I'm surprised they haven't like done a sequel or anything.
3886040	3887040	Yeah.
3887040	3888040	I'm kind of surprised.
3888040	3889040	It was like a thing from the Kickstarter.
3889040	3890040	Yeah.
3890040	3891640	I feel like there was like a mobile thing or whatever.
3891640	3892640	Oh yeah.
3892640	3893640	Not the same.
3893640	3894640	Not the same.
3894640	3895640	All right.
3895640	3896880	Um, we need to catch up on some news.
3896880	3899440	So we're only, you know, we're taping this really partway through the week.
3899440	3900880	So we may not get everything.
3900880	3905040	There may still be some big news that comes up that we don't get to on Sunday, but there
3905040	3907920	have been quite a few headlines to cover nonetheless.
3907920	3910160	So let's start talking about some headlines.
3910160	3914320	So of course this week we had Gamescom and so there's been lots of announcements for
3914320	3915320	that.
3915320	3920000	They had this big open night live ceremony thing hosted by Jeff Keighley.
3920000	3923400	And with that, they showed off a bunch of different trailers for stuff.
3923400	3926560	So some of the things covered there, of course, they talked a little bit about Call of Duty
3926560	3932320	Modern Warfare, which is having an open alpha that starts on, well would have started on
3932320	3934780	Friday, August 23rd.
3934780	3939460	And then they announced a sequel to Kerbal Space Program.
3939460	3943820	So that's coming in 2020, the consoles and PC.
3943820	3947740	There's a game Humankind by Sega.
3947740	3952740	That's that was that big AAA game or whatever that they were teasing last week, right?
3952740	3953740	Yeah.
3953740	3956340	Some simulation game of human history.
3956340	3957340	That's coming in 2020.
3957340	3962020	I guess that's what makes it AAA because it's all of history in one game.
3962020	3965660	Total Nightmares 2 is something that they announced in 2020 as well.
3965660	3968700	THQ Nordic is rebooting Comanche.
3968700	3975220	So they're doing it's a helicopter action game and that's going to be coming out.
3975220	3977380	Need for Speed Heat.
3977380	3979260	They've got the Heat Studio that you can download.
3979260	3982820	It's a mobile app that you can customize cars because they want you to really buy those
3982820	3984460	skins when it comes out.
3984460	3988520	A match at the Gathering Arena should be coming.
3988520	3992240	It's a semi exclusive to the Epic Games Store.
3992240	3996440	Iron Harvest is releasing on September 1st, 2020.
3996440	4000120	This game called Disintegration looks pretty awesome.
4000120	4001440	They showed that off.
4001440	4003760	Not to be confused with a great Cure album.
4003760	4004760	No.
4004760	4007800	And then, of course, let's see what else.
4007800	4010560	And then there was this game called Erika, an interactive thriller.
4010560	4014680	Oh, yeah, because I think Erika they announced some time ago and then it was like that was
4014680	4015800	like their whole like it's out now.
4015800	4016800	It's a PlayLink game.
4016800	4017800	Yeah.
4018080	4020080	You can use your phones with that.
4020080	4023840	And that's available now for 10 bucks on PlayStation 4.
4023840	4027640	And then, of course, last but not least, of course, because Jeff Keighley is involved,
4027640	4032520	you knew there was another Death Stranding trailer coming and they had a brand new trailer
4032520	4037440	showing off some new characters, including Jeff Keighley is actually in the game, not
4037440	4040500	voiced by him, which is awfully weird, though.
4040500	4043240	And then instead they got Gilbert Gottfried.
4043240	4044440	No.
4044440	4049160	And then they have was it the one character, Mama, that they showed off that all sorts
4049160	4050160	of strange.
4050160	4051160	OK.
4051160	4054360	You know, she's breastfeeding a ghost baby.
4054360	4056440	I didn't see the new trailer.
4056440	4062760	I'm I'm kind of all like all my change for Death Stranding hype has been spent.
4062760	4065320	That doesn't mean I don't like want to check out the game or anything.
4065320	4069080	I'm actually doing the game a favor by holding off on the hype.
4069080	4070080	Yes.
4070080	4072080	So that when it comes out, I can just play the fucking game.
4072080	4073080	Exactly.
4073080	4074080	It looks interesting.
4074720	4075720	To be to be clear, I'm not being a hater.
4075720	4077400	I'm actually doing the game a favor.
4077400	4080880	Like I'm worried the more and more we hype this shit up, the more and more we're setting
4080880	4083240	ourselves up for a no man's sky type of situation.
4083240	4085560	So I'm just going to take the game for what it is when it comes out.
4085560	4089720	And then, of course, Microsoft had their own inside Xbox around the same time.
4089720	4095600	So they talked a lot of stuff, including definitely cry fives coming to Xbox Game Pass.
4095600	4096600	Cool.
4096600	4102000	Stellaris console edition, Age of Empires Definitive Edition will be available on the
4102000	4110320	PC games pass eight out in Kingdom Come Deliverance will be coming August 22nd, which is today.
4110320	4114560	And Bard's Tale for director's cut will be coming on the 27th Blair, which is getting
4114560	4118120	added to games pass on console and PC.
4118120	4119120	I have game pass.
4119120	4120120	I have to check that out.
4120120	4121520	And that's on August 30th.
4121520	4127440	Humans Fall Flat will be going to scary a free level on PC and Xbox one.
4127440	4133720	The announced Age of Empires to definitive edition will be coming November 14th and adds
4133720	4137400	better AI, 4K graphics and more improvements.
4137400	4144180	Gears pop actually came out today on iOS, Android and Windows 10.
4144180	4151480	And Gears, let's see, they said that keyboard noises, Jamie, just, you know, they showed
4151480	4159960	off something for NBA 2K 20s career mode, which it has, I guess, Idris Elba and Rosario
4159960	4160960	Dawson.
4160960	4161960	That's pretty cool.
4161960	4163960	Like some big name talent for a sports game.
4163960	4164960	That's pretty rad.
4164960	4166960	Yeah.
4166960	4173160	Ghost War, which is a new multiplayer mode for Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Breakpoint is
4173160	4174520	something else they showed off.
4174520	4178720	And PUBG is getting cross platform play with PlayStation four in an update in October.
4178720	4179760	Oh, wow.
4179760	4184320	New Xbox one controller designs, including one that looks like camouflage and one they
4184320	4187320	call sports blue.
4187320	4188400	It's a pretty blue though.
4188400	4189400	It is.
4189400	4192000	I don't know why it's sports, but it's a pretty color.
4192000	4196520	They announced that they're going to be holding a fan event called XO 19, um, the weekend
4196520	4199360	of November 14th in London.
4199360	4204440	And they're going to have some more announcements around then maybe Xbox, whatever the next
4204440	4207120	X boxes seems a little soon for that.
4207120	4209640	I don't know why you'd announce that just before the shopping season.
4209640	4213720	Like I feel like that's true to recap everything that's going to be available for the holiday.
4213720	4220480	And the next year we talk about Scarlet, uh, Metro Exodus is getting two kernels DLC coming
4220480	4221480	out.
4221480	4227600	Uh, well they already came out by now, August 20th and they showed off a gears war five
4227600	4229040	hoard mode.
4229040	4230040	Of course.
4230040	4231040	Yeah.
4231040	4232440	So that was pretty cool.
4232440	4234080	And here's something quite ironic.
4234080	4240260	So last week we talked about how Minecraft is not getting the ultra awesome, um, super
4240260	4242240	graphics pack on consoles.
4242240	4243240	Right.
4243240	4249160	And then right the very next day, Nvidia's like, Oh, but wait, it's coming to PC because
4249160	4252980	they have a ray tracing support now announced.
4252980	4258160	If you have an RTX, um, a GTX, a G force RTX card, those are pretty high end video cards
4258160	4259160	though.
4259160	4260160	Aren't they?
4260160	4261160	Yeah.
4261160	4266440	So I think 20, I don't know if the 20, 60 supports it, but the 20, 70, 20, 80, um, is
4266440	4270400	that like a mod or is that like an official, officially supported, it's an officially supported
4270400	4271400	thing.
4271400	4272400	Huh?
4272400	4273400	Interesting.
4273400	4275600	So it's gonna, I don't know if this is the windows 10 version of this, but it is showing
4275600	4279240	off like some of the, yeah, it looks like the water effects are pretty crazy.
4279240	4280240	Yeah.
4280240	4281240	So it looks cool.
4281240	4287080	Um, and it is something that's kind of, you know, uh, officially out there.
4287080	4292440	So I mean, I, I, I don't have a card to take advantage of that cause I have a laptop, but
4292440	4294720	it's someday it's about time for me to upgrade.
4294720	4295880	So I'm thinking about it.
4295880	4296880	It is pretty, yeah.
4296880	4301920	I think it might be an holiday gift to myself as to get myself one of those fancy cards.
4301920	4304920	And then a GameStop has laid off over a hundred people.
4304920	4310760	Um, so apparently they also laid off half the staff for a game informer, which I gotta
4310760	4314200	be honest, I get game of former every month and I like thumb through it really quick and
4314200	4315200	it goes in the trash.
4315200	4317360	So, I mean, that sucks.
4317360	4321480	It sucks that they know people's jobs are being gone, but I kind of understand at least
4321480	4323440	the press mega, the, the print magazine.
4323440	4327920	I understand that it's kind of print magazines, a harder and harder thing to push these days.
4327920	4328920	It's sad.
4328920	4329920	Yeah.
4329920	4332360	Um, because it's just a lot of the news that we get out of there.
4332360	4336160	It's just like, it's old by the time you get it, um, getting harder and harder for them
4336160	4340500	to get exclusive news, which was kind of one thing that was keeping them going because
4340500	4345180	GameStop is starting to lose more and more of a foothold on the game sales market as
4345180	4346780	more goes digital.
4346780	4350480	You know, the, the Walmarts and targets of the world keep selling games and you know,
4350480	4355960	so it's GameStop is a company we've been saying this for years, it's kind of been in trouble.
4355960	4361160	You know, obviously I think they're going to pivot a little bit from just selling video
4361160	4364500	games and that you're already seeing that, that they sell more like gaming memorabilia
4364500	4367060	and stuff, shirts, things like that.
4367060	4370420	But I either they're going to continue to pivot that way or they're going to,
4370420	4374580	and you know what, the thing that sucks the most about like that idea, like, and I've
4374580	4378900	said it so many times when I go in there, like I like the fact that they have the merchandise
4378900	4382340	and stuff and then they have merchandise for like kids and everything like that.
4382340	4383340	But guess what?
4383340	4385740	They don't have, they don't have shirts for kids.
4385740	4387340	They don't have kid sizes for shirts.
4387340	4388340	They're all adult sizes.
4388340	4393180	I'm like, so many times I would go and buy, I would totally buy a shirt for my son, but
4393180	4395740	they don't have sizes for him.
4395740	4397660	And it's just, it's kind of frustrating.
4398100	4401500	Not even like just, they have such a huge selection of shirts.
4401500	4406380	Just make a small section of that or small percentage of it, kid sizes.
4406380	4409380	And then I might be, because obviously kids are coming in because you're selling like
4409380	4414020	Ryan's World toys and like the random loot box crap that they have or the surprise eggs
4414020	4415400	and that kind of thing.
4415400	4420540	So obviously you are gearing towards that crowd, but like bring some of that stuff in
4420540	4423900	so that we can buy some of that, you know, because you would think a lot of parents be
4423900	4428540	like, oh yeah, hey, I want to buy your shirt and get them interested in stuff, but they
4428540	4432300	don't have that available, which is such like a loss of potential, I think.
4432300	4433300	Yeah, I hear you.
4433300	4434300	I agree.
4434300	4439500	So anyways, this was apparently part of their previously announced GameStop reboot initiative
4439500	4445220	to transform their business for future and improve their financial performance.
4445220	4451140	They said we can confirm the workforce reduction was implemented impacting more than 120 corporate
4451140	4455940	staff positions representing an approximate 14 percent of our total associate base at
4455940	4459980	our company headquarters, as well as some of the other offices.
4459980	4463940	While these changes are difficult, they were necessary to reduce costs and better align
4463940	4469140	the organization with our efforts to optimize the business to meet our future objectives
4469140	4470140	and success.
4470140	4471140	Blah, blah, blah, blah.
4471140	4477780	Basically, you know, they're trying to reduce costs and realign what their focus as a company
4477780	4478780	is.
4479420	4482660	In other words, this is the last ditch ever to save us from total bankruptcy.
4482660	4487660	I don't know if it's last ditch, but it's kind of like it's we're getting we're they're
4487660	4488660	pivoting.
4488660	4489660	Yeah, pivoting.
4489660	4490660	Yes.
4490660	4495140	We'll we'll stick with that as we knew that this announcement was coming, that we finally
4495140	4500660	got our announcement trailer for the television Amico and they showed off.
4500660	4505860	There was a few I don't know if it was 17 games, but there's 17 games that will be launching.
4505940	4510500	OK, hold up, though, because the trailer wasn't like I was thinking it was going to be like
4510500	4511500	a trip.
4511500	4516540	OK, so that trailer was like a whole bunch of like shots of the Amico, which, you know,
4516540	4517540	it does.
4517540	4518540	It looks nice.
4518540	4522940	Seeing those little controller screens in action was pretty mixed in with Tommy being
4522940	4528100	Tommy and talking a lot for like a good three and a half minutes of that trailer.
4528100	4532300	And then like the last maybe forty five seconds was bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam.
4532300	4534620	Just a bunch of screenshots of games.
4534620	4536100	Don't know what they are.
4536100	4537100	Don't know much.
4537100	4538860	I mean, unless you can kind of figure it out by looking.
4538860	4540020	Don't really know a lot about them.
4540020	4541020	Just bam, bam, bam, bam, bam.
4541020	4544820	It looked like a few a few games I recognize, like kind of look like remakes of like I definitely
4544820	4547300	some remakes of old properties in there for sure.
4547300	4552940	I mean, a lot of them kind of looked like Android cell phone gamey, but like I'm not
4552940	4553940	really shading.
4553940	4554940	They are.
4554940	4556740	It's supposed to be a cheap frickin console.
4556740	4557740	So I get it.
4557740	4559860	I get the quality of the games is not going to be Grand Theft Auto.
4559860	4560860	No, I understand that.
4560860	4563780	And two, there's all the games every two ninety nine to nine ninety nine.
4563780	4567700	No DLC, no in-app purchases, whatever in a family friendly.
4567700	4568700	So I get that.
4568700	4570240	And that's fine.
4570240	4575880	It did look like a lot of the games and I'm trying not to like say this in a way to dog
4575880	4580380	on the console, but a lot of it looked like, you know, kind of those cheap like, oh, we're
4580380	4585300	remastering some of these classic arcade games, you know, with slightly better graphics that
4585300	4588700	you saw, like on the PlayStation one type things.
4588700	4594620	Whereas I would want to see more retro style games like like Shovel Knight type game or,
4594620	4600060	you know, something that's like, you know, that retro style graphics that not necessarily
4600060	4603020	trying to like take an old game and make it like slightly newer.
4603020	4606780	If you want to do that, like, you know, they have the Space Invaders Extreme or something
4606780	4609580	like that, where it's still keeping that kind of classic look.
4609580	4611820	But updating the gameplay would be kind of cool.
4611820	4614200	But then again, we had it's hard to tell based on what is.
4614200	4616540	And I also thought it's still so early to pass.
4616540	4619340	I thought that they weren't doing like 3D games and stuff in there.
4619340	4621780	I thought it was supposed to be just like 2D games.
4621780	4624740	I think you can use like 3D models in a 2D game.
4624740	4627860	Some of it looked like it was 3D, like they have that plane thing.
4627860	4630100	I don't know what that was all about, but who knows?
4630100	4631100	It's hard to tell.
4631100	4632100	Yeah.
4632100	4635260	I mean, there's some things that probably kind of get to break the rules a little bit.
4635260	4639540	But yeah, I mean, it's it is it's way too early to pass off judgment.
4639540	4641060	You know, I don't want to sound like I'm shading.
4641060	4643660	I'm not, you know, let's hear more about the games.
4643660	4648880	I remain open to Amico just because of the fact that the games are going to be so cheap,
4648880	4649880	you know?
4649880	4650880	Yeah.
4650880	4653060	Some of those games, OK, they look like three dollar games, but they are three dollar games.
4653060	4655420	You know, there maybe there's going to be there's nothing wrong with that.
4655420	4656880	Yeah, there's nothing wrong with that.
4656880	4658420	So let's let's hear more.
4658420	4659420	Let's let's see.
4659420	4660420	I'm curious.
4660420	4664020	I'm always a big proponent about I know they're talking about families playing in the same
4664020	4667180	room, but I'm curious if these things are going to do anything online.
4667180	4670900	I guess does Amico even have online capability or did they just cut that out?
4670900	4671900	How do you buy the games?
4671900	4672900	Oh, oh, online.
4673220	4674220	Oh, online multiplayer.
4674220	4675220	Yeah.
4675220	4676220	No, no boards.
4676220	4677980	I don't think there's going to be online multiplayer.
4677980	4680820	I think it's only going to be within the same room because that's what they're talking about
4680820	4685620	is bringing the family get together to ice again for the price.
4685620	4686660	I sort of get that.
4686660	4691760	I'm not expecting it to be like freaking Xbox, Xbox online or something like Xbox Live.
4691760	4694820	But I was just kind of like, oh, it would be neat if like in some of these retro games,
4694820	4698960	you could do clips or but I guess the consoles just probably not going to be powerful enough
4698960	4703400	to do a lot of those modern privileges, if you will.
4703400	4706460	But I really I still want to see what the games really are.
4706460	4710920	You know, I'm hoping that it's not going to become a new year and that that's my only
4710920	4717860	worry because it kind of I'm hopeful that it will be handled well and I think it will
4717860	4718860	be.
4718860	4723040	But like in the back of my mind, I'm still kind of the ooh yeah vibes.
4723040	4724040	I get it.
4724040	4725040	I get it.
4725040	4726280	Because that was the ooh yeah thing, too.
4726280	4728140	They're like, oh, our games are going to be cheap.
4728140	4729140	They're going to be inexpensive.
4729140	4731220	They're going to have like free demos and stuff like that.
4731220	4735660	And then it's just like you you got what you paid for with like cheap games like that.
4735660	4739860	A lot of them are pretty cheap experiences, but that's not to say that it's going to happen
4739860	4740860	again.
4740860	4743860	That's not to say that every time that some concept like this comes out, that's going
4743860	4746300	to be the same thing every time.
4746300	4749700	So I want to see what's going to be on there.
4749700	4750700	It's early.
4750700	4752180	We'll give we'll keep seeing what develops.
4752180	4753180	Yes.
4753180	4754180	All right.
4754180	4755180	All right.
4755220	4762900	And then Sony has apparently purchased Insomniac Games, the recent Spider-Man game and a lot
4762900	4765140	of Spider-Man ratchet and clank resistance.
4765140	4766140	Please.
4766140	4767140	New resistance game.
4767140	4768680	I'd love a new resistance game.
4768680	4771700	It's definitely time and of course, Sunset Overdrive.
4771700	4773140	So I guess we're not getting this equal that.
4773140	4778620	But I'm curious to see, though, because they had even with Sunset Overdrive was an awesome
4778620	4779620	game.
4779620	4780620	And I don't know.
4780620	4781700	This is a great studio.
4781700	4785340	So I'd be curious to see what new IPs could come out from them.
4785340	4790140	I'm curious what their PlayStation five game must be, because very curious.
4790140	4792820	Clearly, that's going to be something in development.
4792820	4794340	Yeah.
4794340	4797700	And then so some more stuff real quick.
4797700	4803660	So they announced the Mortal Kombat 11 DLC fighters, which is pretty cool.
4803660	4808180	Is it just me or does it really look?
4808180	4809180	Really look what?
4809180	4810180	You cut out there.
4810180	4811180	Really?
4811180	4812180	Look what does.
4812180	4815140	Is it just me or does Terminator really look like Arnold?
4815140	4816140	Yes.
4816140	4820820	Well, even not necessarily term, you know, the T-800, but they also had, you know, Shang
4820820	4823460	Zun looks just like the actor from the Mortal Kombat.
4823460	4824460	We already seen that, though.
4824460	4825460	Yeah.
4825460	4826460	I understand that.
4826460	4827980	All that stuff's already out.
4827980	4828980	Spawns.
4828980	4829980	Yeah.
4829980	4830980	Spawns.
4830980	4831980	Awesome.
4831980	4832980	But yeah, like the Arnold.
4832980	4833980	The Arnold model is awesome.
4833980	4836220	I'm kind of mixed on the Joker.
4836220	4839820	I think the Joker kind of looks, but then I kind of went back and looked at like what
4839860	4844380	they did for injustice and stuff, and it kind of looks better than that.
4844380	4848820	So I like that Joker doesn't look like any of the actors that have played Joker.
4848820	4851460	I like that they let Joker be something new.
4851460	4853500	I'm looking forward to Sindel, though.
4853500	4854500	Me too.
4854500	4855860	I stand Sindel in the old games.
4855860	4858220	Like I used to love Sindel in Mortal Kombat 3.
4858220	4863140	I want more story content, though, with Sindel being in there because she was I mean, basically
4863140	4867220	it was because of her that all the revenant characters were around.
4867220	4871220	I feel like I'll finally pick up Mortal Kombat 11 when all these characters are out and they
4871220	4874100	release that inevitable Game of the Year collection for 20 bucks.
4874100	4877300	That's that's what I'm waiting on.
4877300	4883980	So then Dead by Daylight announced that they're getting Stranger Things crossover DLC, which
4883980	4884980	looks awesome.
4884980	4888060	So it's going to add the Demogorgon as one of the monsters.
4888060	4895180	They're going to have also Steve Harrington and Nancy Wheeler as characters.
4895180	4899500	Oh, they didn't want to put children in because it's a killy killy stab stab game, but you
4899500	4900500	put in.
4900500	4902020	OK, so they put in the older teens.
4902020	4903020	Interesting.
4903020	4904020	Yes.
4904020	4909540	And then, of course, they also have the Hawkins National Laboratory is one of the their underground
4909540	4912420	complex is one of the levels that's added in there.
4912420	4916100	Please tell me that Steve is wearing his Scoops Ahoy outfit.
4916100	4917180	He's not.
4917180	4920300	But that's not to say that they don't have like costumes or whatever.
4920300	4921300	OK, good.
4921740	4926020	And technically and technically, if you want to be canon with the show, it should be Jonathan
4926020	4931420	Byers that's with him or with Nancy, not necessarily Steve Harrington, but you can't you can't
4931420	4932420	argue with the hair.
4932420	4937180	I mean, and he's definitely more more popular of a character they could do if it's successful.
4937180	4939380	They could do like Jonathan and Billy maybe.
4939380	4943700	So when are we going to get like a giant like because I get it dead by daylight.
4943700	4947380	I think it's not like a 4v1 or is it like, you know, something like that.
4947380	4954180	When are we going to get the big like battle royale like we've got like 30 or 40 monsters
4954180	4956500	hunting down like 100 people type thing.
4956500	4958200	That would be amazing.
4958200	4961380	That game still performs very well on live streams and stuff.
4961380	4964660	And, you know, it's still like I always see people streaming it on Twitch.
4964660	4968980	So wait, I imagine the developers, if they can sell more copies by putting in a huge
4968980	4971980	battle royale type of thing, I would be down for it.
4971980	4972980	It might happen.
4972980	4976700	And then last but not least, I would say this is pretty cool.
4976700	4982860	Mario and Sonic at the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020 is coming out and they have this new
4982860	4983940	mode that they in there.
4983940	4985100	It's a retro mode.
4985100	4989820	So it actually has the different events done in the style of their eight bit and 16 bit
4989820	4990820	counterparts.
4990820	4991820	OK, that's pretty rad.
4991820	4992820	I like that.
4992820	4994140	It looks like track and field, like the old Konami.
4994140	4995140	They have track and field.
4995140	4996520	They have like diving.
4996520	4999140	They have all of the events are in a retro mode.
4999140	5004300	OK, that's cool, which honestly, this right here, I feel should have been its own game
5004300	5007340	and release as part of like the switch online thing.
5007340	5011580	Oh, because that way it really should have been its own thing.
5011580	5014660	They could sell the retro only version for like 10 bucks or something.
5014660	5015660	That would be fun.
5015660	5018180	But I guess probably cost more money than that to develop.
5018180	5019860	I wouldn't be able to make their money back just on that.
5019860	5021620	But I love the retro mode idea.
5021620	5022620	That's pretty cool.
5022620	5023620	Yeah.
5023620	5024620	They've got like all the different events were in there.
5024620	5029220	I like they had oh, I was trying to pull up real quick.
5029220	5030220	They had one.
5030220	5034020	It was it's judo or something like that.
5034020	5039140	And so they have the princess and oh, my God, that's amazing.
5039140	5040620	It's just it's awesome.
5040620	5042500	And they put some Masonic shitty friends in there, too.
5042500	5044980	Yes, they have sonic shitty friends in there.
5044980	5045980	Wonderful.
5045980	5048000	All right, that's it for news.
5048000	5049000	That's it for news.
5049000	5051260	Quite a bit of news for just a few days into the week.
5051260	5056380	So sadly, with this airing on Sunday, we don't know what will have developed in the Friday,
5056380	5057380	Saturday, Sunday.
5057380	5060860	But I don't think even games comes going on right now is still there's no more news for
5060860	5061860	games com.
5062340	5064460	You know, stuff always develops.
5064460	5066460	There's always something to blog about in the gaming world.
5066460	5067460	Come on.
5067460	5068460	Yeah.
5068460	5069460	Yeah.
5069460	5070460	Something will happen over the weekend.
5070460	5073820	But we'll we'll catch up on all of that when we come back after Labor Day holiday.
5073820	5077280	But believe it or not, we're getting to about that time where we're going to wrap things
5077280	5081580	up and go around to get some final thoughts and wrap things up in the studio tonight.
5081580	5085100	I hope everybody has a great week off for those that are going to Dragon Con.
5085100	5086380	I can't wait to see you guys there.
5086380	5088580	I'm very excited about it.
5088580	5091580	There's a lot of great stuff going on, as we say, towards the end of every episode of
5091580	5092980	Orange Laundrio.
5092980	5094220	Tell a friend or two about the show.
5094220	5097340	Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice.
5097340	5103140	But only if the voices are here to air, you know, out on air.
5103140	5104140	That's it.
5104140	5107140	Five star review on a site like iTunes or wherever you found this podcast.
5107140	5110780	That goes an awful long way.
5110780	5111780	Dark Soccer.
5111780	5114740	Sorry you couldn't be here tonight, but I'm glad we got you in the virtual sense anyway,
5114740	5116700	even if even if we hear you typing away over there.
5116700	5117700	But that's OK.
5117700	5118700	Do you have a final thought?
5118820	5123260	I was just trying to get a few something popped up as kind of an emergency thing.
5123260	5124260	So I was getting it taken care of.
5124260	5125260	All right.
5125260	5126260	Fair enough.
5126260	5131020	Do you have any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?
5131020	5133780	Make Mr. Rogers proud of you.
5133780	5135520	I like that.
5135520	5140380	My final thought tonight is that lots of big changes and good things are in store.
5140380	5142920	I hope I can tell you more in two weeks when we come back.
5142920	5144900	So stay tuned for that.
5144900	5148100	Not all of it is necessarily show related, though I am going to work on the bumpers.
5148500	5151500	I'm really excited, too, about like networking and stealing.
5151500	5154300	I mean, borrowing lots of good ideas at Dragon Con.
5154300	5158260	Really looking forward to meeting other Twitch streamers and stealing some good ideas.
5158260	5159260	I mean, borrowing.
5159260	5161800	Loki, last but not least, sir, your final thought.
5161800	5167780	So I like I said, we start in the game jam on Saturday at noon.
5167780	5170740	I don't know how much time I'm going to get the stream on the weekend.
5170740	5175500	I'm going to hopefully I will be streaming this week, though, hopefully a lot.
5175500	5179780	And I've my wife's actually out of town this week.
5179780	5181940	So that means working late at night.
5181940	5186420	So I'm hoping with the extra time I can actually get in there and be able to put something
5186420	5187420	together.
5187420	5190620	I really, really want to finish something.
5190620	5191860	I really do.
5191860	5196220	I don't want to perpetuate this stereotype that I can't finish any games.
5196220	5203760	But yeah, so, you know, check me out at twitch.tv slash lokiolar and hopefully you'll see me
5203760	5209520	streaming this week and we'll have a lot of fun at least watching me fail if if nothing
5209520	5210520	else.
5210520	5211520	Yes.
5211520	5214880	Speaking of watching things on Twitch, I mean, certainly watching you do that will be a lot
5214880	5215880	of fun.
5215880	5219560	Also, during Labor Day weekend, keep in mind at VOG Network, we're going to be hosting
5219560	5222780	the Dragon Con media track so that a lot of these great panels are talking about stealing
5222780	5223940	ideas from.
5223940	5228440	You can do that as well by watching all the great content over on the Dragon Con media
5228440	5233200	page or excuse me, Dragon Con digital media track page, which will be hosted here at VOG
5233200	5234200	Network.
5234200	5239640	And I'm told that even the ones that don't air live will be shown later on.
5239640	5241120	They're still recording everything in the other rooms.
5241120	5243800	There's gonna be a lot of great stuff that that's coming out of Dragon Con.
5243800	5247920	Very, very, very excited for Dragon Con and the cosplay and a little vacation.
5247920	5250120	So all right, well, that's going to do it.
5250120	5253720	We will be back live on September 8th.
5253720	5256160	No show next week over the Labor Day holiday.
5256160	5261120	Happy gaming, happy game jamming, happy conventioning, whatever it is you're doing.
5261120	5262120	Have a lot of fun.
5262120	5267860	Be safe and we'll be back to do it all again on September 8th live at Twitch TV slash VOG
