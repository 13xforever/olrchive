00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
With your hosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:21,000
This week a big box store chain cuts back on gaming displays while still selling lethal weapons one aisle away from bikes and children's toys. Truly the arbiter of morality.

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,000
This is just one story we've heard too many times before. Stay tuned for the rest of the week's gaming news starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Hello my friends out there on the internet. Welcome back to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
It is episode number 788 for this August the 11th of 2019.

8
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
My name is Rob Roberts and joining me here in studio live at Twitch TV.

9
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Twitch TV slash VOG Network. The voice of Geeks Network.

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Joining me here in studio is Techmaster Loki.

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Yes, it's me. The guy that's shutting down all the background processes because I neglected to bring my power adapter for my laptop.

12
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
You're gonna have to vamp with the camera tonight.

13
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
It literally is gonna eat the battery in like no time flat.

14
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:15,000
You guys don't know like how much Loki multitasks. Well, you probably do know if you watch the show before you can usually see his head buried in a laptop.

15
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
And you know, he's on task. It's not like you're sitting there watching porn.

16
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
But you're, I don't think, but you know, you're looking at stories, last minute stories, things related to gaming.

17
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Or I've seen you working on your game. Like I feel like you get more work done on your game here at OLR.

18
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
No, I don't work on it here.

19
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Yeah, crazy. So yeah, so unfortunately your laptop battery seems to be dying.

20
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Yeah, it's because I was stupid and it's because my kids were distracting me when I was packing up everything before I came over here.

21
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,000
So I did unplug it and wrap it up and set it down and then left. So, oh well.

22
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Things happen sometimes. It's okay. So you're gonna try your best to get through the show.

23
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Got my phone.

24
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Yeah, you have the good old phone back up. We can find you a charger for that if need be.

25
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Why haven't I introduced Dark Sakura? She's, we adore her. She's still very much a part of OLR, just not tonight.

26
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
So Dark Sakura's not with us tonight. She is at a Weird Al Yankovic concert.

27
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Admitting word crimes.

28
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Here in town. Weird Al Yankovic is in town. I'm kind of jealous. I would have liked to have gone to that.

29
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I had no idea that it was happening tonight. But a fine excuse to miss OLR, honestly.

30
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Like, I can't be mad. Like, I almost missed this show for Carly Rae Jepsen.

31
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
So it's only fair that she misses the show for Weird Al Yankovic. It's fine.

32
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
So we'll be back, or she will be back next week.

33
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,000
But we're here with you guys tonight in studio over at, again, Twitch TV slash vlog network,

34
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:38,000
where we do tape live every Sunday night at about six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

35
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Yeah. So you guys can join us in chat there. Bobby Black Wolf points out, actually,

36
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:49,000
he's probably performing word crimes right now. I've missed a show for Weird Al a few months back.

37
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
It's totally acceptable.

38
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,000
At Rum Jump Stomp saying Weird Al is the best concert I've ever been to.

39
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I haven't seen Weird Al in concert. I feel like I'm missing out.

40
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I have not either. And someday, maybe.

41
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Who have I seen? I've seen a lot of good shows this year.

42
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I mean, you know, I love my pop diva queens. So, you know, Carly Rae Jepsen was an amazing show, if you're into that.

43
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I saw Robin earlier this year, which was phenomenal.

44
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I've had the fortune of seeing some good concerts this year. So, yeah, I don't know.

45
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I don't know if I've been to a lot of bad concerts. I've seen bad bands at concerts,

46
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
but I haven't seen just a lot of straight up bad concerts. Like, I've seen bad openers.

47
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I can't think of the last concert I actually went to.

48
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
What about video game related concerts? How about this site?

49
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
And I'll ask you guys in chat, what video game concerts have you been to?

50
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Well, the only one I went to is that Final Fantasy one, one year, I think.

51
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Yeah. I'm pretty sure I've told this story on the show before.

52
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
And in fact, it might have been less than a month ago, but Alan and I, my husband Alan and I,

53
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
met in person for the first time at Video Games Live in Oakland,

54
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,000
the Tommy Tallarico show that travels around and, you know, has been everywhere in the past few years.

55
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
That was actually, we knew each other online on a site called LiveJournal for years and years,

56
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
but we actually met for the first time in person at a video game concert.

57
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:06,000
So, video games are part of the reason I'm in the home situation I'm in today, which is pretty cool.

58
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:13,000
And I would say, though, recently one concert I remember going to that I loved was when I was,

59
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
it was MAGFest, because MAGFest is, right, music and games.

60
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I had a great time at MAGFest a couple of years I went.

61
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,000
And one of the years I went, they actually had somebody playing the game,

62
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
or there's some buddies, they pass it off every now and then,

63
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
but they were playing the game Journey, right?

64
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Not about the 80s band, but the more recent artistic game for the PlayStation 3 and 4,

65
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Journey, they were playing that with a live orchestra playing the music.

66
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Oh, that's cool.

67
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
And it was, to quote a Keanu Reeves term, breathtaking.

68
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:48,000
So, it really was. There's no other word to describe it. It was an amazing concert. I love that.

69
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
So, yeah.

70
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:55,000
ActDef saying, my last video game concert was Capcom Live quite a few years ago.

71
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Bobby Blackwolf saying, shame it's the first weekend in January regarding MAGFest.

72
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Yeah, that timing, you know, I just know I won't be able to get back to MAGFest for a couple of years.

73
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I'd love to go back.

74
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Well, there's also MAGWest, which, gosh, if MAGWest wasn't this weekend,

75
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:14,000
then it's happening really soon because MAGWest, it was the week before Dragon Con,

76
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
but I think it's like two weeks before.

77
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
It's like either this weekend or next weekend. It's coming up real soon.

78
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I always mean to get out there, but it's just, yeah, summer, a lot of busy weekends in the summer,

79
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I usually end up with other commitments and so forth.

80
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
So, that happens.

81
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
So, I would love to see, you know, there's a lot of good musical performances at Dragon Con.

82
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I don't remember if there's a lot of video game related things directly

83
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
because Dragon Con is more of a general nerd convention,

84
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
but I'm sure there's video game influence stuff.

85
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I just haven't made my way down the halls to find yet.

86
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
So, but I'll talk more about Dragon Con in a little bit.

87
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
But first, we're going to get into tonight's kickoff topic.

88
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
So, some video game news, big, big change going on in the industry.

89
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
This is pretty huge.

90
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Yeah, they're taking hints from all the regulation that's coming down the pipeline.

91
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Apparently, the ESA made a statement saying that, hey, guess what?

92
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Microsoft's Nintendo and Sony, they've all agreed on one thing,

93
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
and that is that they're going to make sure that on their platforms,

94
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
you know what the odds are for random loot boxes.

95
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,000
So, you'll actually be able to see what the odds are for specific games

96
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:22,000
and what they're going to feature and the rarities of different items

97
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
that you may get and probabilities and whatnot.

98
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:30,000
So, that's going to apply to new games and game updates that add loot box features,

99
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
and it would require the disclosure of the relative rarity or probabilities.

100
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Now, I don't want to be that guy, but I'm going to be that guy,

101
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
because I feel like when we talked about loot boxes here on OLR,

102
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
when this controversy was breaking,

103
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
when it was really hitting a fever pitch around the legislation,

104
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I want to say about six weeks ago,

105
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
when it looked like it might actually make its way to Congress and so forth,

106
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I want to say that I said, you know who could fix this problem,

107
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
and you know who could stop this before it goes to the government

108
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
and the government makes the wrong decision,

109
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
because no matter where you are politically, I'm pretty sure we can all agree,

110
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
the government would have made the wrong decision on this.

111
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
At least this government.

112
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Yeah, at least this government.

113
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Maybe other governments would have done better.

114
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,000
But anyway, I believe I said, who could fix this?

115
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Microsoft could fix this. Nintendo could fix this. Sony could fix this.

116
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Now, the gag I didn't predict was that they would all do it together.

117
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
That's a gag. I did not see that one coming.

118
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
But I thought, oh, I kind of figured,

119
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I thought Microsoft would be the first,

120
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
just because they do have involvement on PC and so forth,

121
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
that they would do something on their marketplace,

122
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
because I remember making the joke,

123
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Nintendo would be last to the table, because hello, Nintendo went online.

124
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
So I remember this topic coming up.

125
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
But it is pretty, you know, it's funny,

126
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
because I also feel like that's been a running theme,

127
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
is that, you know, all these game companies kind of working together

128
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
for greater good all of a sudden, right?

129
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
We had a story just a few weeks ago about Sony and Microsoft

130
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,000
teaming up on cloud gaming in some regard, right?

131
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
So is the smoosh cameo actually happening on the stream?

132
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
You can see his head.

133
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Just a little bit. Maybe if you let him walk in a little more.

134
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
He might hop up on that table. Who knows?

135
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
But anyway, not to distract too much from our podcast listeners,

136
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
but you know a smoosh cameo is always going to distract us here on OilOck.

137
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Why did you stop petting me?

138
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:23,000
So anyway, it's really something that they've all kind of banded together in a way.

139
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
So there was the cloud gaming thing, but now there's this.

140
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:31,000
All three have come together to essentially end the loop box.

141
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I mean, I don't know. Would you say this is the end?

142
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Like, where do we go from here?

143
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
It's not the end. It's just now they're like, well, look, see,

144
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,000
we're being transparent about the randomization on it.

145
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:46,000
So that's why it's okay. See, we're being good.

146
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Yeah, I gotcha.

147
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
It's not gambling, except it is.

148
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Yeah. Well, but now it's less gambling now that you know the odds up front.

149
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
So there you go.

150
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
There you go. Hey, this is the moment you've been waiting for.

151
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Look at that.

152
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
He is full on taking over now that Jamie's not here.

153
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
So center stage is going to clean himself right there.

154
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Usually, her stuff is all up on this table here,

155
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,000
but Mr. Smoosh has just decided to make it its home tonight.

156
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I can't wait till we get into gaming weeks,

157
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
because this fucking cat has done so much this week with gaming.

158
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
But anyway, I'll get to it. I'll get to it.

159
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:29,000
So anyway, but yeah, so it's interesting that all three have banded together.

160
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
But you don't think this is the end?

161
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
No, it's never the end.

162
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
It's not the end.

163
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
It's too much money to be the end.

164
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Where do we go from here?

165
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Do we think the amount of loop boxes will decrease

166
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
because we're seeing these companies take a stand?

167
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Does this make it get bigger or what?

168
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I think it's just not going to really affect anything.

169
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I think it's just now making it more acceptable in the eyes of the publishers.

170
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
It's like because, oh hey, but we're letting you know what the odds are.

171
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,000
So you're making a decision to buy that.

172
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
You know what the odds are.

173
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
You're making the decision to do that.

174
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Right.

175
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Do you think more games adopt loop boxes,

176
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
or do you think we see this continued stepping back trend?

177
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Because I think there's a quick little follow-up on this, right?

178
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I think there's a fine line.

179
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
It's the same offenders that keep doing this,

180
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:17,000
and it's putting loop boxes in games that really don't need to have them

181
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
or putting them in there after the fact,

182
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
like Activision adding them to Crash Team Racing

183
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
after the game's been reviewed.

184
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
It's like, oh yeah, now we put it in there.

185
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Ha, you already reviewed the game.

186
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
It's too late now.

187
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
You bought the game.

188
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Now they're in there.

189
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
So I don't know.

190
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
But we do have a story about one game getting rid of loop boxes, right?

191
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
This is true, yes.

192
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
So Rocket League is getting rid of loop boxes.

193
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
That's right.

194
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
So they're going the route because, you may remember,

195
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
the parent company of Rocket League did get purchased by Epic Games,

196
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
so now they're taking their loop boxes

197
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:55,000
and actually doing a kind of loop system that's similar to Fortnite

198
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:00,000
in the sense that you'll kind of have a path laid out of,

199
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
like, here's the stuff you're going to unlock,

200
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
kind of like their season passes that they're going to have,

201
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
or they don't call them season passes.

202
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:12,000
They call them, like, battle passes or, like, their seasons that they have.

203
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
So that's how they're doing it.

204
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
So there's going to be transparency there,

205
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
but it's not going to be random loop boxes.

206
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Now RumJumpStomp in our chat over at twitch.tv slash vognetwork says,

207
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,000
a lot of people are really angry about Rocket League removing crates

208
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
because of the effect it will have on the trading economy.

209
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Oh, well, that's just, you know, it's for the great.

210
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
It's for the greater good that these things are gone.

211
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Too bad for your economy.

212
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I don't know, it's not a game I have really a stake in, so, yeah.

213
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
No, but I mean, if it was, let's, you know, this could be happening in any game.

214
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
You know what, it doesn't matter.

215
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Whatever someone does, it's going to offend somebody.

216
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
So, what are you going to do?

217
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Well, I think it's going to be interesting to see how this plays out from here.

218
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I do think the trend of removing loop boxes,

219
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I mean, you've seen Fortnite kind of do the more x-ray thing,

220
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
so it's like a different, it's not so much like the gambling mechanic

221
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
as it is you know what you're buying up front.

222
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Like those types of like bundle packs and things of that nature,

223
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
they're never going to go away.

224
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
But I think the randomization,

225
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
the things that could even have that appearance of gambling,

226
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
you know, now that we know the odds and so forth,

227
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I just feel like these things are going to take a downward trend overall.

228
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Well, and with the Fortnite stuff, I mean, at least that,

229
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
with their like battle passes or whatever they call them,

230
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:30,000
you can, if you play the game enough or you can play it well enough,

231
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
you can actually earn enough credits to buy it with in-game money

232
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
each time and kind of keep that rolling.

233
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,000
So I think that's kind of cool that you can do that.

234
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Yeah.

235
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Don't know if they'll have something similar with Rocket League,

236
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
but we'll see.

237
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
We'll see, indeed.

238
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Some other comments from chat.

239
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Spyro Jonathan says, Loki is so right about that with CTR Nitro Fueled

240
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
and the microtransactions were not ever advertised to be in the game

241
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
when it was released.

242
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
That does kind of make it feel right.

243
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Well, it's Activision though.

244
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
I mean, Modern Warfare, the game that they put out,

245
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
it's a remaster, let's throw some of that shit in there

246
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
because that's what people want.

247
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
They're just going to do it because they make money off of it

248
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
and you'll bitch and moan about it,

249
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
but in the end, people buy them and they make money off of it,

250
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
so they don't care.

251
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Interesting comment from Questbuster.

252
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Questbuster says, reminds me when Valve accidentally crashed

253
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,000
their Team Fortress 2 rare hat economy by accidentally making

254
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
certain ones drop like crazy with the patch.

255
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Yeah, that was recently.

256
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Yeah, and that is interesting when like, you know,

257
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,000
a bug or something happens there that kind of shoots the economy in the foot.

258
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
It's kind of interesting.

259
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Well, that economy is also what's getting legislature.

260
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:43,000
You know, if you have random loot boxes and there's a monetary value

261
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
associated with that loot that you have,

262
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
that's a problem because that'd be gambling.

263
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Kaijuto in chat says, Rocket League used to have a slot machine

264
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
like Roll when you opened a loot box.

265
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
They took it out like months ago, so they've been working on removing

266
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
the random loot stuff before this news.

267
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Oh yeah, no, I don't think like this.

268
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Yeah, it's more just kind of a coincidence in timing.

269
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,000
It's one of those timing things where I think together we see that loot boxes,

270
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:12,000
you know, it's changing drastically and it's, I think, in large part

271
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
because of, good job EA and Battlefront 2.

272
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Like, if you can point at a reason and go,

273
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
that was the day that loot boxes died.

274
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:26,000
That game really started everybody getting pissed off at those.

275
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
EA is their own worst enemy.

276
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Because when it was Mass Effect 3 and the type of thing they did there,

277
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I remember the early days, that didn't seem so agitating, I think.

278
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
But I think that was because it really wasn't hard to earn enough

279
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
in-game currency to open your own loot boxes.

280
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
It was just that money was for the impatient, you know what I mean?

281
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
So, but then, you know, more companies realized,

282
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
oh, people will pay more money.

283
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
And then, oh, you're paying money on a $60 game.

284
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Let's do more money on top of that to play as Darth Vader.

285
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
You know, so anyway.

286
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Yeah.

287
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
All right. Well, let's move on.

288
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,000
We'll see what develops in the coming weeks with this whole loot box thing.

289
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
But this time next year, at least we're going to know all the odds on it.

290
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:07,000
I will say one game that, you know, I play a bit of is Overwatch.

291
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
And, you know, that game is a huge game on loot boxes.

292
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Now, they're all cosmetics, so I think Blizzard usually tends to dodge

293
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:17,000
the bullets when it comes to this discussion in the industry about loot boxes

294
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:22,000
because, you know, the balance of Blizzard's game is not impacted by the loot boxes in it.

295
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
But it is going to be interesting to see a game of that caliber

296
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
because they said Blizzard was in on this, right?

297
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,000
So they're going to end up disclosing the percentage of, you know,

298
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
if you get a gold or a purple or what have you.

299
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
So it'd be very interesting.

300
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Yeah.

301
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
All right. Anyway.

302
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Well, let's move on and talk about our gaming weeks

303
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,000
and the types of video games or other games, as the case may be, I'll get into,

304
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
that we have been playing this week. So, Loki.

305
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,000
So I've been playing more Pokemon Go because the reason I haven't had my gotcha

306
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
for the few weeks is I couldn't find the charging cable for it

307
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,000
for like the longest time. And so I finally found it and it's charged

308
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
and now I'm wearing it.

309
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
So I've been playing a little bit of Pokemon Go

310
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
and I did one of the Team Rocket fights or whatever

311
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,000
and then I couldn't catch the piece of crap, you know, Charmander

312
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
or whatever they wanted me to catch after that.

313
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
So that was a little annoying.

314
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
What else?

315
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
I played a little bit of the Jurassic Park arcade game

316
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:18,000
because I was in arcade because we went to play more laser tag at yet another place.

317
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,000
So actually I went back to an old stomping ground that we used to go to,

318
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Country Club Lanes, where they used to have 5th Mix back in the day

319
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
and we used to play it from like midnight to three in the morning.

320
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Man, DDR 5th Mix was one of the best soundtracks.

321
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
It was great.

322
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
That techno remix of the Neverending Story.

323
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Now that arcade is full of just the biggest,

324
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
just the same game to see at every goddamn arcade.

325
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:41,000
So Jurassic Park, the ride, our Jurassic Park game they had there was pretty cool.

326
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
It was a little bit different of a cabinet because they have,

327
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
it actually, the seat moved when you're playing the game.

328
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
So it was a little bit more enhanced.

329
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
But it's just, it's such a, it's such a sign like,

330
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
what happened to all this?

331
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Sorry, but speaking of dance games, quick tangent,

332
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
I'm sure you, I think I saw you post about that video.

333
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
So there was like a tournament at round one in the Bay Area.

334
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Yes, the night motion.

335
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Yeah, they did a dance rush stardom tournament

336
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
and that routine with the couple that was,

337
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Awesome.

338
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Darted Seer, somebody can you find that video and link it in our chat?

339
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Cause I know you have to know what I'm talking about.

340
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
It's in my Twitter.

341
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
But there's, oh yeah, it's on your Twitter feed.

342
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
That's right.

343
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
But, um, that routine of that, that couple and what they were doing,

344
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
I get like, I don't totally understand.

345
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Dance rush was so weird for me to say, cause I was, I used to love,

346
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
but I still do love Bawani. It has a place.

347
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
I would love to have one of those machines, but I would love to have one.

348
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
But like watching them do that routine, that was unreal.

349
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
That was amazing. Props to those guys.

350
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
I don't even know their names, but props to them.

351
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
That was certainly from Sacramento too. Shut up. Really? Yeah.

352
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Should get them on the show. What the hell are we thinking?

353
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Loki, what are we doing with our lives?

354
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
All right, no, we need to get them on the show at some point.

355
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Open invite if you guys are out there. Yeah.

356
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
So yeah, that's cool.

357
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,000
So yeah. So, uh, now I have played at all of the laser tag places,

358
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
except for one in Elk Grove, um, that are in the Sacramento area.

359
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,000
And so we actually played laser X today because we had gone to that arcade

360
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,000
for so many times and laser X has been there since as long as I can remember.

361
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Long time. Long time.

362
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
I think they've updated it since we were going there.

363
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,000
But, um, so I've actually played that system before at this other place

364
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,000
in Roseville, but they have, it's like slightly older. Um, it was okay.

365
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:19,000
I don't really like it too much. Um, so then we went back to the usual one.

366
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
We go to jazz tag and I played a game there.

367
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:25,000
I've just feels more like keys are to me. Whereas the, um,

368
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:29,000
the zone laser tech system, Helios one that they've got over there.

369
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:34,000
It's just, it's just all of it's very like kind of cheap feeling it.

370
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,000
The packs feel very cheap. The sound effects sound really shitty.

371
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
This the way that like, it doesn't seem very accurate.

372
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
It's just all of it feels really cheap,

373
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
but they just had an international tournament like in the Netherlands,

374
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,000
just not too long ago, like very recent for zone.

375
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,000
So it's very popular out there, but I don't know. Um, so yeah,

376
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,000
so that's pretty much is just laser tag and Pokemon go.

377
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,000
I'm working on game dev stuff cause I've been actually doing that this week.

378
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
All right. So my gaming week,

379
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,000
so I've been talking for several weeks about fakie survivor, right?

380
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,000
And the fake survivor game I've been playing with that started with 22

381
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,000
people. Um, so that survivor game was actually supposed to end tonight.

382
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Tonight was supposed to be the last night.

383
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
It was going to be the final tribal council and all that stuff.

384
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
They couldn't do it tonight. You know why?

385
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Cause I got too far in the game and I have this show as a commitment.

386
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
So they actually had to bump it to Monday night. I think one of the other,

387
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
one of the other girls that got really far also had some scheduling

388
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,000
problems. I can't really take all the credit. Um, but uh, yeah,

389
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,000
so they actually it's ending tomorrow. And um, so, you know, last,

390
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
I think the last update I gave you guys, I was in the final six, right? Yeah.

391
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
So a lot happened. Okay.

392
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,000
I found a hidden immunity idol and I knew it on the last episode,

393
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
but I couldn't say anything about it.

394
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Cause I don't know who's watching played the hidden immunity idol at final

395
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
six erased three votes that were for me,

396
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,000
sent the other person home that got three votes on them during the immunity

397
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
challenge, which involved,

398
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:59,000
I had to have my camera on the floor because we had a water bottle in a sock

399
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,000
that we had to spin around a tower of solo cups and keep it going as long as

400
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
possible. I know it sounds ridiculous, but it's based on a real challenge.

401
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Again, that was on the show. It's just using 99 cent clearance store props

402
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
instead of the stuff you'd see on CBS. So here's the hilarious thing.

403
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,000
So while the camera is on the floor and I'm doing this, um,

404
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
probably about 45 minutes into the challenge,

405
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Mr. Smoosh comes in the room and Mr. Smoosh, I shit you not.

406
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,000
He walks into the frame and he like stares because he sees my phone.

407
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,000
I'm on Skype. He sees all the other people doing the challenge and he's like,

408
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
what's going on? What's going on? He walks right up to my phone,

409
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,000
knocks my phone on the ground and then the chaos knocks my tower over.

410
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
So Mr. Smoosh eliminated me from that final six challenge,

411
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
which is why I had to basically play the hidden immunity idol to save myself.

412
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:45,000
So anyway, um, yeah, that was Mr. Smoosh's little stardom this week.

413
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
So now he's doing this during OLR. He's like,

414
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
I want to be like dad and be on camera all the time. So that was that.

415
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Anyway, um, long story short, the final immunity challenge was today.

416
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,000
I was still in it. Three people left,

417
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:03,000
did the final immunity challenge and I won the final immunity challenge

418
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
and I got to choose who to take to the final two.

419
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:09,000
So I am in the final two of the game and the final tribal councils tomorrow.

420
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
The hosts really want me to put it on my Twitter to see if some of you will

421
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
go watch because they want to recruit for next season.

422
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,000
So I will put it on Twitter so you guys can watch me win or lose.

423
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Like I don't know what's going to happen, but I've had a lot of fun.

424
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,000
I met a lot of great people and had a real emotional roller coaster.

425
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Like I'm not going to lie.

426
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,000
I lost it when I won that immunity challenge because it was something I

427
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,000
never expected to win because it was very physical in nature.

428
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Do you guys want to see what I had to do? You ready to,

429
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
you want to see the final challenge? Here we go Twitch. All right.

430
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
So apologies to the podcasters.

431
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:41,000
I'm going to have Loki narrate what I'm doing and try to use my loud voice so

432
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
you can see what the final endurance challenge.

433
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
So if you ever watched the TV show,

434
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:49,000
you know that the final challenge and survivor is usually some sort of

435
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
endurance challenge. You ready? Okay, here we go.

436
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
So Loki, you got to narrate for the podcast.

437
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:58,000
All right. So, so he has a cup and then let's see,

438
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:03,000
was this like a shoelace? Yeah. So he's holding a tight shoelace.

439
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:08,000
So I got to do, how the hell did I do this? I think it was this. Yes.

440
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Okay. And then I got to do, so he's wrapping around his fingers between his hands,

441
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,000
like the thumb and the pinky, right? All right. Thumb and pinky.

442
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
I did it the wrong way on one hand.

443
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
I hope the hosts are watching because I struck,

444
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:24,000
I struggled bust with this so hard when we were doing it. Okay.

445
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,000
So you have to make sure the inside is on like those three fingers.

446
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:32,000
You ready? Uh-huh. Middle finger, pull. Middle finger, pull. Cat's cradle.

447
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
All right. Cat's cradle. Okay.

448
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:39,000
So then you have to, oh shit, this is the wrong way.

449
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Okay. Then you have to like. You have to grab this solo cup.

450
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Oh, God damn it. I did what I did during the challenge. No.

451
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Hold on, I'm going to try this one more time. I'm going to try this one more time.

452
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,000
This happened to me during the challenge when we were trying to set up.

453
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Like I could not get it going and I know they were making fun of me.

454
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Okay. So he's putting it back on his hands again.

455
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Middle finger, middle finger. All right. Cat's cradle.

456
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:11,000
And he's going to grab the cup, which is upside down by wrapping it around it.

457
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:15,000
And he's got to hold the cup. So I have to hold it out like this. Out in front of him.

458
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:20,000
As long as possible. That's it. You hold this pose.

459
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:25,000
If the cup falls, you're out. So guess how long I went.

460
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
How many hours?

461
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Nine hours.

462
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Oh.

463
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:33,000
About, I don't have the final time, but I think I know we hit the 30 minute mark.

464
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:37,000
So I would say about 32 minutes. The first person was out after three minutes.

465
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:43,000
He just, the thing about that, like it's one of those things where it's like, it's, it's harder than it looks.

466
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Because if you pull too tight or if you're too loose on that.

467
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
It's going to slip off.

468
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
It's going to slip off or it's going to fire out with a cannon.

469
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:55,000
And I think that's what happened to the girl who came in second is I think she adjusted.

470
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Because I could see her doing all these yoga poses and things like that.

471
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
And I think when she was doing it, because it's hard.

472
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,000
My hands were freaking killed. My hands are still sore right now.

473
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,000
But I think she pulled too hard and the cup went shooting out.

474
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,000
So, and I think that's why. So, yeah.

475
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,000
And yeah, so that was, that was the challenge we had to do.

476
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:18,000
They're not all physical though. I know I've showed a lot of physical stuff on OLR, but some of them are like puzzles and things like that.

477
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,000
So it was, yeah, it's been, it's been interesting.

478
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
So next week we'll know if I actually won or not.

479
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:29,000
But I got down to the final two and I'm super considering I, I've played a handful of these games at this point.

480
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:33,000
And I usually flop them all, meaning I'm usually a pre-jury.

481
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Like I'm just like super stoked that I've gotten as far as I have.

482
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
So there you go.

483
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Let's see.

484
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Looking in chat at some of the comments there.

485
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
So let's see.

486
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Kaijuto in chat says, first survivor had Boston Rob, now they have OLR Rob.

487
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Who knows? I don't, see, here's the thing.

488
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Playing it from my home is so much easier because I actually get to still eat.

489
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
You don't want to see me when I'm hangry.

490
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Like I was already emotional enough over this game.

491
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,000
I don't need to like starve myself to death on top of that.

492
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
That would be, that would be insane.

493
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
So anyway, there you go.

494
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:11,000
So that was, that was fakie survivor and we'll see what happens tomorrow.

495
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,000
But I did get to play some video games amongst that because as,

496
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:18,000
as the numbers were dwindling down, we sort of run out of things to talk about.

497
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
So I actually got to catch up on some other games.

498
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
I've been playing Overwatch randomly.

499
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:27,000
I just, I just started playing some matches and I wanted to see if the party system was in it yet,

500
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
or like the forced role thing was in it yet.

501
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:33,000
It's not, but I still just did some quick plays.

502
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:37,000
I got to finally do some more matches with Batiste because like he's not so new anymore.

503
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
So the newness of him has died down.

504
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,000
So I actually got to do some matches with him and Lucio.

505
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
And actually I had a great run as Lucio for some healing.

506
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
So that's, that's good.

507
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Cause that's a character, excuse me, hiccups that Allen's really good with too.

508
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
So did some Lucio there as well.

509
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,000
And yeah, so I played some Overwatch and then I've been playing, of course,

510
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:58,000
a crap ton of Final Fantasy 14.

511
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
I'm still trying to catch up in the expansion.

512
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
I've made it a long way.

513
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:06,000
I've just completed the level 79 dungeon and trial.

514
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Again, I don't want to ruin it.

515
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
So I want to tell you what it is.

516
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,000
It's a great throwback to Final Fantasy 1.

517
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
I'll say that much.

518
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
And if you've played the new expansion,

519
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:18,000
the level 79 dungeon is a direct reference to Final Fantasy 1.

520
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Go back and look it up.

521
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
So that was pretty cool.

522
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
But yeah, so I, that's where I'm at.

523
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
So I'm almost to the end of the story, I think.

524
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
So that'll be good.

525
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
But the story, the story's kind of picked back up.

526
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,000
It lagged a little bit in the Amorang Zone around level 77,

527
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
but now it's really picked back up ever since I got out of there.

528
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,000
So I'm really enjoying the Shadowbringers expansion.

529
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
It's great.

530
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:42,000
So actdeft going back to Overwatch saying,

531
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
I'm waiting for Sigma to release officially.

532
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,000
The little I played of him on the PTR was fun.

533
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Yeah, I want to check out Sigma as well,

534
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
although I haven't done the PTR yet.

535
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Going back to Survivor,

536
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
SH-100Matt in chat says,

537
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Nicely done, Rob.

538
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Maybe you will come back on the All-Stars version.

539
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
You know, I've had to, like,

540
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
I have not streamed in six weeks,

541
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,000
and you can basically blame this game for that.

542
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
And I don't regret it.

543
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
I've met some wonderful people that I'll keep in touch with

544
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
long after this game is over and so forth.

545
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,000
But I don't know if I could do it again.

546
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Like, it's a lot to put on hold.

547
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
And I know I always say that,

548
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
but here's the difference this time, guys.

549
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Usually I get booted, like, in 14th place.

550
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
So I only spend a week and a half on the game,

551
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
and then whatever, it's done.

552
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
This time, I've gone the full length of the game.

553
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
I mean, win or lose tomorrow,

554
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
I went the entire length of the game.

555
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
It was like 51 days tomorrow.

556
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
It's 51 days.

557
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:33,000
So, you know, that's a long time to put everything else on hold.

558
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
But that's, like, Ingress has been on hold.

559
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,000
This has been, like, everything has been on hold.

560
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
So I don't know if I could do that again.

561
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,000
But I did say, if they do call me for All-Stars,

562
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,000
it's going to be hard to not answer the phone.

563
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,000
But the good news is, so they've already done an All-Stars.

564
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
This is the ninth season they have an All-Stars.

565
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
It's usually every seven.

566
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,000
So I have a good, like, five seasons to wait.

567
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
So it's going to be a while before I have to make that choice.

568
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
And that'll be very good, if they even call me.

569
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
But they may not.

570
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
There's been a lot of great people that have played the game.

571
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
So they may decide, I've had my run, I've had my story.

572
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
I don't come back.

573
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
But we'll see.

574
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,000
There's not a lot of guys over 30 that play these games.

575
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,000
So I feel a very unique void in that.

576
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
So, all right.

577
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Anyway, enough about all that.

578
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Let's get into some other housekeeping.

579
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Oh, before we get to the gaming news,

580
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:26,000
I should give DragonCon a plug because DragonCon is coming up.

581
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
So some quick programming note.

582
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:33,000
We will be here live with Dark Sakura next week for episode 789.

583
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:38,000
790, the week after that, will be pre-taped.

584
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,000
We will be taping that without an audience in advance,

585
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
but we will be taking your questions.

586
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,000
It's going to be very much a listener-driven show with your questions.

587
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
We may try to do an interview or something during that week as well.

588
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,000
And Gamescom is going to happen that week.

589
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,000
So we'll be able to do that.

590
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,000
That'll be a lot of news, yeah.

591
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Yeah, that'll be quite a bit going on.

592
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,000
So we're going to tape that without an audience.

593
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,000
And then that will premiere on Sunday night after the Bobby Blackwell show.

594
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
That is due to my travel.

595
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
I'm actually leaving a week early for DragonCon this year

596
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:07,000
to go spend time with Xtfer out in North Carolina where he lives now.

597
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
So I will be leaving the day before.

598
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,000
So 790 will not be live, but we hope you all will come out anyway.

599
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,000
And then it'll still be on the podcast feed and all that good stuff as well.

600
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
And you guys can certainly chat about it.

601
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:20,000
And I will go back and read the chat transcript afterwards because I do that.

602
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,000
And then there will be no show Labor Day Weekend

603
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,000
because DragonCon is going on.

604
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
And we will be back the week after Labor Day.

605
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
I think it's September 8th is the date.

606
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
We'll be back with episode 791 at that point.

607
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,000
So that's kind of how that is going to go.

608
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Wow, episode 800 is going to be before the end of the year.

609
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,000
That's crazy, isn't it?

610
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Yeah, anyway.

611
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:46,000
So, yeah, and Bobby will still be live that week that 790 is taped in advance.

612
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Now, speaking of DragonCon,

613
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,000
the channel won't necessarily be dark during DragonCon

614
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:56,000
because we will be hosting the brand new DragonCon Twitch channel,

615
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
which, Bobby, I'm going to butcher this name.

616
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
I'm sorry, so correct me if I'm wrong.

617
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:02,000
I believe it's DC Media Track is their Twitch.

618
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Bobby will correct me in chat if I'm wrong.

619
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:08,000
But we're going to be hosting their channel here at VOG

620
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,000
because some of the panels that Bobby, myself,

621
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:15,000
and some other folks you might know will actually be broadcast on that.

622
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,000
So even though there might not be an OLR that weekend or a Bobby that weekend,

623
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,000
you can actually tune in on Twitch and you'll be able to see some other stuff going on.

624
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Thank you, Bobby.

625
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,000
It's DC Digital Media is the actual name of that channel.

626
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
So you can go give them a follow if you want.

627
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:31,000
I figured I probably should tell you what my DragonCon schedule is.

628
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,000
I think we're at the point where I can share that with you guys.

629
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
So you guys ready to hear about it?

630
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Of course, now that I've said that, I lost my email.

631
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,000
So I need to bring it up again.

632
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Help me buy time, Loki.

633
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:49,000
Mr. Smoosh is trying to put himself onto a potholder.

634
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
Okay, I got it. I got it. Sorry.

635
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,000
So here is my schedule for DragonCon this year.

636
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
So Friday at 1130.

637
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,000
This is in the room that I don't believe will be broadcast.

638
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
It's in Galleria 7.

639
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,000
But I'm going to be on a panel called Discussion or Discord?

640
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
What's wrong with peace, love, and understanding?

641
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,000
And that'll be talking about are we encouraging open discussion

642
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
or are we just eroding debates?

643
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,000
We're going to be talking a little bit about tough fandoms

644
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
and some of that real passion that goes into it.

645
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Sometimes we get very passionate on this show.

646
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
So we'll talk a little bit about that.

647
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:22,000
Okay, thanks Bobby, saying that even the Galleria 7 stuff

648
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
will be recorded and posted later.

649
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
It just won't be live.

650
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
The stuff in Room 6 is going to be live.

651
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
This is a pretty big deal.

652
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:32,000
So that's my only panel on Friday, believe it or not.

653
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
No, the Tiger Claw.

654
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
The panel is called Discussion or Discord?

655
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Not to be confused with the Discord app.

656
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
It has nothing to do with the Discord app.

657
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
It's talking about the actual meaning of Discord

658
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
where you disagree with people.

659
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
Good question.

660
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,000
Because we do love Discord,

661
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
but this panel has nothing to do with that.

662
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
That's my only panel on Friday.

663
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
So this one's a pretty big deal on Saturday.

664
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
You ready for this?

665
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
So Saturday at 1130 a.m.

666
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
at the Peachtree Ballroom at the Westin.

667
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
So it's a ballroom, this is a big panel.

668
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
I am fortunate enough to be moderating

669
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,000
Meet the Cast of World of Warcraft.

670
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
So I'm going to be moderating a panel with voice actors

671
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
including Dave Fennoy.

672
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,000
So he's done voices for Walking Dead and all that.

673
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
That's going to be amazing.

674
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:16,000
Dino Andrade, who I believe is friends with,

675
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
I follow him on Twitter.

676
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
He's friends with other people

677
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
that have been on the show before.

678
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,000
He does Professor Putricide,

679
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:26,000
and he does all the little gnomes and those voices.

680
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
He's very good at those voices.

681
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Kimberly Brooks, also a very well-known voice actor,

682
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
is going to be on that panel as well.

683
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,000
I believe she is, I may be wrong.

684
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
I'm very, very sorry if I got this wrong.

685
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:40,000
I believe she's the new princess

686
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,000
of the Horde side in this expansion.

687
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
I'm so sorry if I'm incorrect,

688
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
but I believe that is it.

689
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:50,000
And then Quentin Flynn and Samantha Inouye-Hart.

690
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
And I'm so sorry if I butchered those names

691
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:54,000
because I haven't done my full research on that yet,

692
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,000
but you know I love World of Warcraft,

693
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
so I'm very excited to be doing that.

694
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
All right, Saturday at 2.30,

695
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
this was the VoG-submitted panel.

696
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
So Bobby and I are leading this one.

697
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
Video didn't kill the radio star.

698
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Moving your audio podcast to video.

699
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
You know, we might know a thing or two about that, right?

700
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,000
I guess.

701
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
So we're going to be sharing some of the experiences

702
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
along with Bobby about moving to Twitch,

703
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
but you know what's really cool about that panel?

704
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:20,000
We have some other podcasters that have made that same move.

705
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,000
We have a representative from Twitch on that panel.

706
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,000
What?

707
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,000
Yeah, cool, right?

708
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
And that will be streamed.

709
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,000
That is in Galeria 6.

710
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Tell them that you're streaming exclusively a mixer, though.

711
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,000
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

712
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,000
All right, so not when there's a Twitch employee on the panel.

713
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
That is Saturday at 2.30 Eastern,

714
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:42,000
so you've got to subtract three for Pacific, okay?

715
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
Oh, is Run, Jump, Stomp on that panel, too?

716
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
I don't know his real names.

717
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
That's really cool.

718
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,000
All right, awesome.

719
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:51,000
All right, then I'm on a panel Saturday at 5.30.

720
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:54,000
This will be in Galeria 6, so it will be streamed.

721
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,000
Very cool.

722
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
I'm so honored to be a part of this.

723
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:01,000
Speaking Out, Podcasting Wall, LGBTQIA+.

724
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:05,000
So I get to be on the Rainbow panel Saturday at 5.30.

725
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,000
That is awesome.

726
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
There's going to be some great guests on that,

727
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
including is Nifty listening?

728
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Nifty, you out there?

729
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Guess who's on that panel?

730
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,000
You're going to be excited about this.

731
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,000
Dax!

732
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,000
From RuPaul's Drag Race Season 8 is on that panel.

733
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,000
So very excited about that.

734
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Sunday at 10 a.m., so that's going to be very, very early,

735
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
but if you guys want to catch that, it'll be streamed, too.

736
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,000
I'm going to be on the Twitch 102 panel.

737
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,000
So last year I did 101.

738
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
This year I get to moderate 102.

739
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:40,000
A lot of feedback we got with 101 was that it was too much about the Ys,

740
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,000
and I think many people that attended were already streaming on Twitch

741
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
and wanted to know more about the technicals,

742
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
like the promoting your stream, the things like that.

743
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
So this panel's for y'all that asked for that.

744
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:53,000
So that will be Twitch 102.

745
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:56,000
That will be streamed Sunday at 10 a.m.

746
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:00,000
And then I believe my last panel, which will be in Galleria 7,

747
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,000
so it's not streamed but it's still an honor to be on this,

748
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:06,000
Sunday at 5.30, Twitch and other streaming.

749
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,000
So we are allowed to say the word mixer at that panel, Loki.

750
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
Twitch and other streaming, growing your audience.

751
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:15,000
So we talk about how to grow your audience and collaborate and work together.

752
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
So I'm excited to meet people.

753
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
I'm excited to be a part of it.

754
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:22,000
I'm so honored that digital media has included me.

755
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,000
I mean, I'm on six panels and five of them are digital media,

756
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,000
and I'm honored that the video game track had me back this year,

757
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:32,000
even if my schedule only allowed for the one panel, but it's what a panel.

758
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,000
Like, I mean, if I can only do one panel, to be doing World of Warcraft is...

759
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:40,000
Well, following up from last year where you did, was it the Mass Effect one?

760
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
I did, I did, and that was an honor as well.

761
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
I don't know if they, I think they are doing another Mass Effect panel.

762
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
They just, you know, they want to give somebody else the opportunity,

763
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
and I can't argue with that.

764
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
So that's great.

765
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
So I'm really looking forward to both of those tracks.

766
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,000
And yes, Nifty805 in chat says,

767
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:58,000
you are hashtag booked and blessed.

768
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
Yes, I am booked and blessed this year at DragonCon.

769
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
I'm very excited about it.

770
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
And yeah, hoping to see all the other events.

771
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,000
If you are planning on attending DragonCon and you'd like to meet up,

772
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:11,000
please join our Discord channel over at VOG Network.

773
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
That's vognetwork.com slash Discord.

774
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:16,000
We actually have a channel all about conventions,

775
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,000
and we will absolutely be using it for DragonCon this year.

776
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:22,000
Even if you can't be there, we'll be showing pictures and so forth.

777
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,000
I don't want to speak out a turn,

778
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:30,000
but I do believe if there is a way for Bobby and myself

779
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:34,000
to create some sort of video content for y'all at DragonCon,

780
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
outside of these panels, obviously,

781
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,000
and deliver it to you guys here on the channel,

782
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
you bet yourself we'll do that.

783
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
We're going to do that.

784
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,000
So I can't give you any details yet because we haven't hashed that out.

785
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:48,000
But I think it's safe to say we'll have something.

786
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,000
We'll do a little something-something.

787
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:52,000
And some of VOG Face's past and present will be there.

788
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
I know some of our friends from Voice Geek Network

789
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
that do other shows are planning on being there as well.

790
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,000
So I don't think we're going to have quite the large turnout from prior years,

791
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
but certainly like Travis Donovan.

792
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
I know it's going to be there.

793
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
Xtopher's very first DragonCon.

794
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,000
I'm excited to have him get to see all that

795
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
and give his impressions because he won't hold back.

796
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,000
So that'll be fun.

797
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
So we'll get to do a little guys-on-a-show reunion

798
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
while we're at DragonCon so that'll be fun.

799
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
So we're going to have a great year.

800
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
Labor Day weekend in Atlanta. It's going down.

801
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
I'm excited.

802
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
All right. Let's get into more video game news.

803
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
So Loki, why don't you start us off?

804
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
So this one's interesting.

805
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:28,000
So apparently Take-Two has sent some private investigators

806
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:32,000
to a YouTuber's house to kind of crack down on some leaks.

807
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:36,000
So this was a guy by the name of Supmato.

808
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:40,000
He was posting different leaked information about Borderlands 3.

809
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:45,000
And the way he came across some of this stuff was

810
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:52,000
Take-Two were working on the Twitch integration for Borderlands 3.

811
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:56,000
And so there was a trailer that came out talking about some of that.

812
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:00,000
And in the trailer, they goofed and showed the username

813
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,000
of one of the Twitch accounts that's tied to it.

814
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:06,000
And lo and behold, it was a legit Twitch account.

815
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,000
These people subscribed to it.

816
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:11,000
They saw other Twitch accounts that had these really weird names attached to that.

817
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:15,000
And so they were, whereas the accounts were streamed privately,

818
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:20,000
they could take the mobile app and it would show kind of a screenshot

819
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,000
of what was streaming on that channel, keep refreshing,

820
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:27,000
and then eventually get screenshots of stuff that they haven't announced things for,

821
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
like skill trees and whatnot.

822
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:33,000
And so he was able to leak stuff out based on that.

823
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:37,000
They've also DMCA'd, striked his channel 63 times for different videos.

824
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
Well, hold on. Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

825
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:44,000
These were like private Twitch streams that maybe employees were using to stream to each other.

826
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
But the way the Twitch app works, though.

827
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
Right. You can still see the thumbnails.

828
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
So how is that this guy's fault?

829
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:53,000
They're the ones that broadcast it on Twitch.

830
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:57,000
Because they're saying that, well, he also had a private Discord

831
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:01,000
that he charged money to Patreon subscribers to get access to.

832
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Okay, yeah.

833
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:06,000
And so they're saying that they're selling their copyrighted works.

834
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:10,000
That's where it gets dicey when you get a little too...

835
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
I don't know what the word... I don't want to say greedy.

836
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,000
Greedy is the wrong word.

837
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:16,000
But when you get a little too like, you know,

838
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,000
there's just too much of that overeagerness type of thing

839
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:22,000
to like be the first to be the one breaking news that it's like,

840
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,000
let's make a little coin off it.

841
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:26,000
But now it's getting dicey because you're making coin off it no matter how much.

842
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,000
So, yeah.

843
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,000
But he also...

844
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,000
That makes sense.

845
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:32,000
He also was leaking some other stuff prior to this whole Twitch thing as well.

846
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:36,000
So, he may have had, you know, communications with different insider employees or whatever.

847
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:41,000
But this was basically his shtick and what happened.

848
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
But he was kind of surprised to see that, you know,

849
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
there were some private investigators that actually came to his house

850
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
and started questioning about stuff,

851
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:51,000
which is kind of an interesting move on Take-Two's part.

852
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
Overzealous, says ActDeaf, is the word.

853
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,000
Yes, it is.

854
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,000
Wow. Thank you.

855
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:58,000
And he's an English teacher in Mexico.

856
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
So, of course, he thinks of the word before I do.

857
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,000
Thank you. Yes.

858
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,000
That is a good word for it.

859
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
SG100Matt says, stuck your hand in the cookie jar too much.

860
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
That's another way to put it, for sure.

861
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,000
Yeah.

862
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:14,000
So, of course, you know, he put out a video talking about the situation was happening.

863
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,000
2K Games put out a statement saying, you know,

864
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:20,000
that the information that's out there is untrue and incomplete.

865
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
And so there's some more stuff.

866
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
But in the end, Take-Two's a big company.

867
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:28,000
They have enough money to sue him into oblivion or at least, you know,

868
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,000
strong arm him that way.

869
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:32,000
So, it's going to happen.

870
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
But now the information is out there.

871
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
You can't stop the spread of information.

872
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,000
This is true, yes.

873
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
So, I mean, maybe some things that they had planned to save for Gamescom

874
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:43,000
or some other types of announcements are surely out there now.

875
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
So, I mean, it does kind of take the wind out of those sails.

876
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:52,000
But, yeah, I mean, that's just the nature of, like, the, I don't know, journeys.

877
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:56,000
Well, maybe be careful when you're posting your, you know, streaming video with IDs in there.

878
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,000
That's part of it.

879
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
But, yeah, you got to be careful with that stuff.

880
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,000
Don't they have people that review those things?

881
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
You would think.

882
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:04,000
But it also just goes to show, like, you know, just how, you know,

883
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:09,000
foaming at the mouth people are about, you know, any little piece of information.

884
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
I mean, look at YouTube culture.

885
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:14,000
People will make, and Twitch, or any streaming, really, culture,

886
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
Twitch, Mixer, whoever you want to say.

887
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:20,000
But YouTube, I would feel like, especially, people will make five-minute videos

888
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:24,000
out of, like, hey, some guy posted a Reddit, a thing on Reddit about this.

889
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,000
And let's look into this.

890
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:28,000
So, you know, that's just, like, you take that one little bit of information,

891
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:33,000
and it's, like, you just, like, people make all this content about it.

892
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,000
Yeah.

893
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,000
You know, it's crazy.

894
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:39,000
And I know that I fully see the irony in that when we're doing a show like this.

895
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:42,000
But I like to think we talk about more than one thing on this show.

896
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,000
You know what I mean?

897
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,000
Yeah.

898
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,000
So, yeah.

899
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
So, anyway, people going crazy for Borderlands 3 information.

900
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,000
Yeah.

901
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,000
When's the game come out?

902
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,000
September.

903
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,000
Yeah, okay.

904
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,000
Well, it's only a month away.

905
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,000
It's, like, a few weeks away.

906
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,000
Yeah, it really is.

907
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:57,000
Now, Dartitsuya in chat says, the dissection videos.

908
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
I do enjoy some of those.

909
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
Yeah, I'm not knocking them and saying they're all bad.

910
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
I'm just saying that's, like, part of the culture,

911
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
is that when one little piece of information leaks out,

912
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:08,000
it's, like, all these, you know, information.

913
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:12,000
Like, I remember Shane would show me, not so much for this round of Pokémon,

914
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:15,000
but the last round of Pokémon when, like, X and Y were the new games,

915
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:18,000
or, I'm sorry, Sun and Moon were the new games.

916
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
Like, there would be the littlest little trailer,

917
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
like, two-minute trailer that Nintendo would put out,

918
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,000
a little mini-direct or something.

919
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
And then it's, like, the 90-minute discussion video.

920
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,000
Yeah.

921
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,000
It goes on.

922
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
Because this was back when we were doing, like, Pokéstop podcasts regularly,

923
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
and I was always, like, dang, how do people do, like,

924
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
90-minute videos off, like, a two-minute...

925
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
I think you'd be surprised.

926
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
They were bad videos by any means.

927
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
They were definitely, like, enthusiastic fans,

928
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:43,000
really getting down and dirty on all this content.

929
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
So this is very, very interesting.

930
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
So, anyway, moving on.

931
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:51,000
So something that you can't really dissect anymore because it's gone.

932
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:57,000
It has to do with DuckTales and DuckTales Remastered.

933
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
DuckTales Remastered specifically.

934
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
No longer available for purchase.

935
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:04,000
If you thought that game would be around forever, it is not.

936
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,000
At least digitally.

937
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:08,000
Now, you know, there's physical copies out there in the world,

938
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:11,000
and, you know, they'll always be out there on secondhand markets,

939
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:14,000
flea markets, garage sales, places like that.

940
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:17,000
But I do think because so many people got this game digitally,

941
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:20,000
and now that option has been pulled,

942
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
you can no longer get this game digitally.

943
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
You can still redownload it if you purchased it before,

944
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,000
so don't freak out.

945
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
But, I mean, there's even going to come a day,

946
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
just like they pulled down the Wii shop eventually.

947
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
There's going to come a day when the Wii U shop,

948
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
if you bought it there like I did, goes down,

949
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:36,000
so you won't be able to redownload it, or, you know, whatever the case.

950
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:40,000
Well, I bought it on Steam because they had it down for $3.74,

951
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,000
so I was like, yeah.

952
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:44,000
They had a huge sale, and I wish we could have got this out there

953
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:47,000
before it got delisted, but they only gave us, like, three days notice.

954
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,000
Yeah.

955
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,000
It was out, and then it was gone.

956
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:52,000
August 8th was the day it was delisted, so it is gone.

957
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:56,000
No more can you get this game on Steam or PS3 or Xbox 360.

958
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
It was backwards compatible on Xbox One, though,

959
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:01,000
so I wish I did have it.

960
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:05,000
I think they gave it away for PlayStation games at one point,

961
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
so I think I have it on PS3.

962
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,000
Yeah, I do sort of remember that.

963
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:11,000
And I have it on Wii U, but I don't think I ever got it on Xbox.

964
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
I would love to get a physical copy for Xbox, though,

965
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
and then that way you could play it on Xbox One,

966
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
because it was a good game.

967
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:21,000
The original DuckTales game is one of the greatest NES games they ever did, really.

968
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
Yeah, and the remaster is pretty good, too, from right here.

969
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
Yeah, and the remaster was pretty faithful.

970
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:28,000
It added little bits at the beginning and end,

971
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
but they did a really good job with it.

972
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:33,000
And the vert soundtrack is really, really good

973
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:36,000
with all the reimaginings of the songs.

974
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:41,000
So, yeah, they had it down to 374 until it was gone forever,

975
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:44,000
but the physical version might still be a way to find it,

976
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
but I imagine the price of that physical version

977
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:50,000
as people realize it's going to have a little bit of rarity to it now,

978
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:53,000
the price of that might go up. We'll see.

979
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:57,000
Now, Bob Coffee says you can still find physical copies for PlayStation 3

980
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:00,000
at Walmart for $12.88 pretty easily.

981
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:04,000
Bob Coffee also pointing out, though, that these are showing up on eBay

982
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
for 40 bucks already.

983
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:10,000
So you might have to wait a little bit for things to kind of even out a bit.

984
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
Just go buy used copies somewhere.

985
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:15,000
Oh, for sure. Well, even the used copies are probably, you know,

986
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
I don't know what it currently runs out on GameStop,

987
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
and now your computer's dead, so you can't look it up for me.

988
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:20,000
I have a phone.

989
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:23,000
No, it's fine. I'm sure somebody can look it up, too.

990
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:26,000
Also, D'Artecia points out that was the last performance

991
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
of Alan Young's Scrooge.

992
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:32,000
And, you know, it was great that he still did the voice acting.

993
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:36,000
You could tell he was a little older, and his voice was a little more,

994
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:39,000
you know, at a very mature stage, you know, when he was doing it.

995
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
I mean, he did a great job, don't get me wrong,

996
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
but you could definitely tell it was, you know,

997
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:46,000
he was getting to that point where he's very, getting older,

998
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:50,000
and, you know, probably harder for him to do, very hard work.

999
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
Because who does the voice now? Doesn't David Tennant do the voice

1000
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
of Uncle Scrooge now in the new?

1001
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,000
Yes, I think so.

1002
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,000
Yeah.

1003
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
So let's say, D'Artecia says,

1004
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:01,000
I want to say there was another actress that passed away from that game.

1005
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:04,000
I forget. Wasn't it, I hope I don't butcher the name, June Ferre.

1006
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,000
Wasn't it Magic of the Spell?

1007
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,000
Yes, it was Magic of the Spell.

1008
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
I don't remember who that actress is.

1009
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,000
It's June Ferre, isn't it?

1010
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,000
I'm almost positive.

1011
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
Somebody look that up for me, because I think I'm right.

1012
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:15,000
Now Bobby Black Wolf talking about the price equalization saying,

1013
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
just wait a little bit.

1014
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:21,000
Final Fantasy 13 on Xbox 360 shot up on the used market

1015
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
when the Xbox One backwards compatible version came out,

1016
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:27,000
but after a few months, it was back down to a more reasonable price.

1017
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,000
Yeah, absolutely.

1018
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
D'Artecia does think I got that right.

1019
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:33,000
Yeah, June Ferre was in like her 80s or 90s when that came out.

1020
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:39,000
So, you know, I believe, I want to look up her Wikipedia article

1021
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
because I don't want to say she passed and then be wrong.

1022
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
Because that's like the most horrible thing you can do.

1023
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
She passed on the other project.

1024
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
Yes, that's right. She passed on to other projects.

1025
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
Let's double check here.

1026
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:50,000
I'm getting the bit.

1027
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:54,000
Okay, she did pass away in 2017 at 99 years old.

1028
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,000
Bless her heart.

1029
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:56,000
That's a long way.

1030
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
That's a long, big life.

1031
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:02,000
So, yes, June Ferre did pass away and she was looking up.

1032
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:05,000
I'm just confirming in her filmography.

1033
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:06,000
There's radio.

1034
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,000
Where's TV?

1035
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:08,000
Where's DuckTales?

1036
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,000
It's got to be in the 80s.

1037
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,000
Where's DuckTales?

1038
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
It's got to be in the 80s somewhere, right?

1039
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
She was on the Smurfs.

1040
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,000
She was Jokey Smurf.

1041
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
I never realized that.

1042
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
So, she was on the Gummy Bears, too.

1043
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:20,000
Good lord.

1044
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,000
Yep, she was Magic and a Spell.

1045
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
There it is, DuckTales 87 to 90.

1046
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
So, it's June Ferre.

1047
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
I'm glad I remembered that, actually.

1048
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,000
I'm proud of me.

1049
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:31,000
All right, let's move on.

1050
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
Some news about Rockstar, right, Loki?

1051
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:42,000
Yeah, so you may know game testers have been kind of getting the brunt of the firings

1052
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:45,000
when game development ends on certain games.

1053
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:49,000
But now, though, that may be changing a little bit with Rockstar

1054
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:53,000
because Rockstar is actually converting their game testers now to full-time,

1055
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,000
which is pretty awesome.

1056
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:59,000
So, they're basically now making it full-time positions

1057
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:02,000
so that testers don't have to worry.

1058
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:05,000
Once their contract is up, are they getting fired?

1059
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
What's their next job going to be?

1060
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:10,000
Now, there's a little bit more stability in that sense, which is kind of nice.

1061
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:16,000
And apparently, this has gone into effect as of the beginning of this month.

1062
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:21,000
And they didn't say how many people this is affecting

1063
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:25,000
or whether it extends to the temporary workers that they had before.

1064
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
But it is something that's positive, at least.

1065
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:32,000
Yeah, they said a large number of staff are enrolling temporary contracts

1066
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:37,000
and live in the hope that they will be extended and be able to pay rent

1067
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:41,000
as the end of their contract approaches.

1068
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:46,000
I don't feel anyone is uncomfortable speaking out

1069
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:50,000
in the hopes that they can extend long enough to be permanent.

1070
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:54,000
Staff are often reminded how lucky they are simply working for Rockstar.

1071
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,000
Yeah, which is unfortunate.

1072
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
They kind of rub that in their face like,

1073
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:01,000
well, you're lucky to have this job even though it's shitty or whatever.

1074
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
So, it is nice that they're extending that out

1075
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
and hopefully paying them better with that.

1076
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:09,000
Maybe other companies can take note of that.

1077
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
It's nice to hear a little bit of good news

1078
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
about the way people are treated in the industry

1079
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:16,000
because taking them on as full-time and not just being tapped

1080
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,000
means they get the benefits.

1081
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
There's a lot of other perks that come with that.

1082
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:22,000
Just think of the extra money that you would have, Rockstar, in Take-Two.

1083
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:25,000
If you stop sending private investigators to YouTuber's houses.

1084
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
Wow. All right.

1085
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
Let's move on and talk about Gamescom.

1086
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
It's coming up very soon.

1087
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
So, those of you maybe over in Europe,

1088
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:37,000
if you're going to be near Germany, maybe Cologne specifically,

1089
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:40,000
you might head on over to Gamescom.

1090
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:45,000
So, Jeff Keeley is actually going to be doing a big press conference

1091
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:48,000
called Gamescom Opening Night Live

1092
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:51,000
because there hasn't really been a big press conference.

1093
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
Microsoft and Sony used to do them.

1094
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:57,000
PT, the epic playable trailer for the Silent Hill game that never was,

1095
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:00,000
that was a Gamescom thing that came out of Gamescom.

1096
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
I thought it wasn't Tokyo Game Show or anything.

1097
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
No, I'm pretty sure it was Gamescom. Yeah.

1098
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:08,000
They even cite that in this story that PT was part of that.

1099
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,000
PT2.

1100
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,000
Well, yeah.

1101
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:14,000
But anyway, Jeff Keeley is going to be putting together a press conference in Cologne

1102
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:19,000
and of course, Jeff Keeley does the game awards.

1103
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
So, he's used to putting on these big event shows.

1104
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:28,000
Gamescom Opening Night Live will be Monday, August 19th at 11 a.m. Pacific

1105
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
because of the weird time zone difference.

1106
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:33,000
It's actually at 8 p.m. over there.

1107
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
But because they are that far ahead,

1108
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:40,000
it's going to be 11 a.m. for us here in the Pacific coast of the U.S.

1109
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:45,000
So, Hideo Kojima is going to be there to present yet another look at Death Stranding.

1110
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
We're getting close. I'm okay with it.

1111
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
Is it coming out this year or is that next year? It's next year.

1112
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
I think it's next year.

1113
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:52,000
I think it's next year.

1114
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:55,000
Some more publishers that we'll be showing.

1115
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
There's a lot of people here.

1116
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:58,000
2K Games.

1117
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,000
Oh, no. Sorry.

1118
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:00,000
Act Def corrects us and says it is this year.

1119
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
November is when it is out.

1120
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,000
So, there you go.

1121
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:07,000
Anyways, some of the other companies that will be showing up at Opening Night Live.

1122
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:14,000
2K Games, Activision, Bandai Namco, Bungie, Capcom, EA, Epic Games, Google Stadia,

1123
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:21,000
Deep Silver, Private Division, Sega, Squeenix, Sony, THQ Nordic, Ubisoft, and Xbox Game Studios.

1124
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:22,000
That's a lot.

1125
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
That's a lot of the big players.

1126
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:27,000
That's pretty much everybody you'd expect to do some things at E3.

1127
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
So, yeah, that'll be cool.

1128
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:34,000
Dark Tetsuya thinks it could be Need for Speed related news coming from EA.

1129
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,000
That would be exciting.

1130
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:36,000
We'll be into that.

1131
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
Yeah, I heard that they're doing a new one.

1132
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:42,000
And they also have a new IP for Plants vs. Zombies.

1133
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:44,000
That's right.

1134
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:47,000
Speaking of new IPs, or, well, this could be recycled.

1135
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:48,000
Who knows?

1136
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:55,000
But apparently Sega is getting ready to reveal a AAA game at Gamescom.

1137
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:56,000
Hmm.

1138
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:00,000
So, yeah, Sega is teasing an all-new AAA game.

1139
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:03,000
They send an email out to various blogs and so forth.

1140
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:11,000
Sega will also be showing off Catherine Full Body, Two Point Hospital, the Sega Genesis Mega Drive Mini, and so forth.

1141
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:14,000
But, yeah, the fact that it's AAA, that's interesting.

1142
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:17,000
Could it be a new Sonic game?

1143
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:20,000
Could it be a new PC related?

1144
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,000
I mean, we don't know.

1145
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:24,000
We already know about Phantasy Star Online 2, so I don't think it's that.

1146
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:27,000
Unless, oh shit, if they made, like, a new mainline Phantasy Star game.

1147
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:30,000
Could you imagine, like, after all these years, Phantasy Star 5?

1148
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
I would be, I'd cry.

1149
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:35,000
That would be amazing if they did, like, a Phantasy Star 5.

1150
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:41,000
Or even just, like, a single player type of game, you know, set in, like, PSO or PSUs.

1151
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:45,000
Like, what was that game on PS Vita, or was it PSP?

1152
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:49,000
Like, it was just, like, Phantasy Star Universe, but, like, a single player campaign.

1153
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:50,000
I'd love something like that.

1154
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:53,000
I would just love another Daytona game.

1155
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:54,000
Huh?

1156
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,000
Yeah.

1157
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:56,000
Doo doo doo doo doo doo.

1158
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:57,000
That's all they have to do.

1159
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:58,000
Just play that.

1160
00:52:58,000 --> 00:52:59,000
Just play that.

1161
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:05,000
And just as silly, you know, to be really silly, they could have Kazurai come on stage and go,

1162
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
It's Daytona!

1163
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,000
Daytona!

1164
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
Kazurai's busy being retired at this point.

1165
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:12,000
Oh, come on.

1166
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,000
All right.

1167
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:16,000
Questbuster's saying Nintendo will be a game's commifier call correctly.

1168
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:20,000
Luigi's Mansion 3, Sword and Shield, The Witcher 3 port will be there among others.

1169
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:21,000
Yeah, that's true.

1170
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
S.G. 100 Matt says, Don't over-hype us.

1171
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:28,000
If you over-hype it for us and then tell us it's two years away, you're hurting your own game.

1172
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:30,000
So, we'll see.

1173
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,000
It sounds like Sega could be ready to release.

1174
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
It's Shenmue 4.

1175
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:34,000
Shenmue 4.

1176
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:36,000
And please kickstart it for us.

1177
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,000
Anything is possible.

1178
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:38,000
Who knows?

1179
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:41,000
Support our Patreon and it will develop Shenmue 4.

1180
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:42,000
Who knows?

1181
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:43,000
More news, Loki, right?

1182
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:46,000
Yeah, so No Man's Sky Beyond is coming out.

1183
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
I feel like we've talked about it for the past three weeks.

1184
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,000
It's coming.

1185
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:50,000
It's coming.

1186
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,000
It's coming.

1187
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:52,000
But they tease us a little more every time, right?

1188
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,000
Yeah.

1189
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
So now it's finally coming out this week, though.

1190
00:53:55,000 --> 00:54:01,000
Dude, Alan, when he wasn't playing, he was playing the Black Mesa, the Half-Life redo,

1191
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:02,000
right?

1192
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:03,000
He played that.

1193
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
I think he finished that, and now he's back on No Man's Sky.

1194
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:06,000
Like, he plays it a lot.

1195
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:09,000
I almost want to re-buy it on PC, just so I can play with him.

1196
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:15,000
I'm with you there, because I was just about to say, so there's a brand new trailer that

1197
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:20,000
got released, and they set it to the same music as the original trailer, and oh my god,

1198
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:23,000
it looks, this is like what it should have been when it launched.

1199
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
This is like the hype that they had before.

1200
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
So 16 to 32 players.

1201
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:30,000
They're going to add VR support, the Nexus social space.

1202
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:33,000
You can tame creatures in there.

1203
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,000
You can ride them as well.

1204
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
They also put milking in there.

1205
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:40,000
I don't know if you really need to get blue milk out of those things.

1206
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:48,000
Multiplayer missions, cooking and crafting recipes, better aliens, power and logic and

1207
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:52,000
industrial bases, and lots more.

1208
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:56,000
And that looked awesome, based on the trailer that they had.

1209
00:54:56,000 --> 00:55:00,000
Yeah, I was going to say, I was interested in getting it on PC so I could play with Alan,

1210
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:05,000
but I am just too intrigued by the VR part of it.

1211
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:08,000
Like, the fact that it's going to be playable on PlayStation VR.

1212
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
And Oculus, too.

1213
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:11,000
Oh yeah, for sure.

1214
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:12,000
Yeah, sure.

1215
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:15,000
So if you are on PC, I mean, you're going to have that, but I don't have those.

1216
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:16,000
I have PSVR.

1217
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:17,000
Yeah.

1218
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:20,000
And they said the VR is really good in it, too.

1219
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:24,000
Oh, I'm getting chills just thinking about, like, I hope I can find my disc.

1220
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
That's the other thing I'm worried about.

1221
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:27,000
So there's that.

1222
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:31,000
And then here's another cool thing, though, that is something that they're interested in doing.

1223
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
They want to bring it to the Switch.

1224
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:37,000
So that's something else that they're looking into right now, is how can we port this to the Switch?

1225
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:45,000
Because, you know, obviously the Switch is much less powerful than, say, a PlayStation 4 or PC.

1226
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:48,000
But it is something that they're interested in.

1227
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
And, you know, it's super interesting.

1228
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:51,000
I love the Switch.

1229
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:54,000
We're obviously very focused on what we're doing right now.

1230
00:55:54,000 --> 00:56:00,000
We have done a lot of work for PSVR to optimize the game, so I'd be interested to see what's possible.

1231
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:04,000
But at the moment, we're just very focused on what we're doing right now.

1232
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:09,000
So it is something that he's interested in, but we'll see.

1233
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:14,000
It might be a while before that actually happens, if it even is able to happen.

1234
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:20,000
It's just so crazy how much they've really been dedicating themselves to working on this game.

1235
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:29,000
And whether it was something they were always going to do, or they felt a sense of obligation after the first release was not so well received.

1236
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:32,000
But as we know, they've really made up a lot of ground within the industry.

1237
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
We had that story a few months ago.

1238
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:35,000
I think they've redeemed themselves.

1239
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:36,000
For sure.

1240
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:43,000
It's right up there with Final Fantasy XIV's rebirth, with Diablo III removing the Auction House and fixing the entire freaking game.

1241
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
What they've done with No Man's Sky is right up there.

1242
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:46,000
I think it's going to be pretty incredible.

1243
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:54,000
I think if the trailer reflects actually what the game is, because remember, that was the issue with the original trailer.

1244
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:55,000
True.

1245
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:56,000
But I think they've gotten better now.

1246
00:56:56,000 --> 00:57:03,000
Even just watching Alan play, and Alan has a lot of parts from my old computer, so he's not even running the newest stuff.

1247
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:07,000
And just looking over his shoulder, watching him play on PC, I'm always like,

1248
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
Dang, this game is so pretty.

1249
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:14,000
Some of the areas that he's in, I'm like, dang, I never really found a place like that on PlayStation.

1250
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:17,000
And it's just so mesmerizing to watch.

1251
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
It'll be fun. Multiplayer will be fun now.

1252
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:24,000
Yeah, I'm excited for the fans of this game that have been waiting for this for so long.

1253
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:28,000
And I'm excited for people like me that were casuals.

1254
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:32,000
I haven't played it in a very long time since any of the expansions have come out.

1255
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:38,000
Even when they did with the Stargates and stuff, I remember Bobby and I did some streams on Twitch, and we had a good time.

1256
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:43,000
We built star bases so we could find each other, the little Stargates so we could connect, and that was really cool.

1257
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:50,000
So the fact that that's going to get taken even further now with these larger squads, and you put VR on top of that.

1258
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:58,000
The only thing I'm worried about is when I played VR Skyrim, it's beautiful, it's great, it really is immersive.

1259
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:03,000
I could only do it for so long before I just started to feel a certain way.

1260
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:08,000
And that's just the way I'm wired, the way my brain is, and my health and everything.

1261
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:17,000
It's just that after an hour or so, I have to really take it off and be like, I have to disconnect from VR because it's too much.

1262
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:21,000
It starts to have a physical effect on me that I don't like.

1263
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:27,000
So that's the only thing I'm worried about a little bit with this, but for the most part, I'm very excited about it.

1264
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:33,000
Looking in chat, ActDef says, if it does come to the Switch, cross-platform multiplayer, please.

1265
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,000
Oh, wouldn't that be great if it wasn't cross-platform?

1266
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,000
Well, does it even have cross-platform between PC and PlayStation 4?

1267
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:44,000
They don't because, and I think there's a reason for it, because when the game first launched, we weren't talking about cross-platform and all that yet.

1268
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:48,000
It was just kind of an accepted thing that PC and PS4 would be separate.

1269
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:56,000
Well, I think the problem is now, at this point, probably why they can't fuse them together, is that basically you have one universe on PC.

1270
00:58:56,000 --> 00:59:01,000
Where things have been named and everything's got their thing, and you have another universe on PS4 that's kind of the same thing.

1271
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:09,000
I don't know if they can just combine them, because what happens if you've got a planet over here and a planet over here, and you don't know what's been built on one versus the other.

1272
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:15,000
So I don't know if they will be able to successfully bridge that gap without pissing somebody off.

1273
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:22,000
But you would think, couldn't they just take all buildings, like in the entire universe, what would be the odds?

1274
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:33,000
But you know what would happen to somebody, there'd be that Kotaku story, like the merge of the worlds has caused one person's base to be squashed by another person.

1275
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:38,000
There'd be that thing, but I would think there'd be a way to work it out somehow, you never know.

1276
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:41,000
Dartusuya says, I could get into No Man's Sky on Switch.

1277
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:46,000
Run Jump Stomp in chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network says, probably Sony getting in the way.

1278
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:57,000
Well, you know, Sony had to back off a little bit because they were really painted out to be the bad guy in a lot of the talk about Rocket League and what was the big one?

1279
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:07,000
Oh, Fortnite. Fortnite was the big one that I think really made PlayStation have to kind of, because it was all the people trying to get their Epic accounts on Switch and they couldn't do it because they had it on PS4.

1280
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:13,000
And like all their stuff was getting locked out and that made Sony look like really bad. That was a very bad PR thing for Sony.

1281
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:19,000
So I think Sony has kind of been forced, pressured by the gamers out there to go back on that a little bit.

1282
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:22,000
And you know, for the most part, they have at this point.

1283
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:27,000
So, um, Run Jump Stomp says, they weren't painted to be the bad guy, they were the bad guy.

1284
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:32,000
You know why I give, here's why I give them just a little shred, a little shred of credit.

1285
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:35,000
Remember guys, I'm a big Final Fantasy XIV player.

1286
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:42,000
That game has always been cross platform between Sony, PlayStation 4, and PC.

1287
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:45,000
So like I've been playing a game for years that is cross platform.

1288
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:48,000
I'm surprised that hasn't come to Xbox One yet.

1289
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:57,000
I'm surprised too amongst all of this that I, that was one of my predictions for E3 was that they would announce that Shadowbringers would be out on Xbox One as well.

1290
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:02,000
I am also surprised. I can understand maybe why they don't want to do the Switch because you know the reality is-

1291
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:03,000
Well that makes sense, yeah.

1292
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,000
Well A, it's an MMO so you can play it on the go.

1293
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:09,000
I'll tell you what, you can bring 11 to the Switch because that should be able to run that.

1294
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:10,000
Yeah.

1295
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:11,000
I would hope.

1296
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:12,000
You know the mobile version.

1297
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:16,000
When is that coming out by the way, the mobile version of 11?

1298
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,000
It's been like ten years.

1299
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:21,000
The mobile version of 11 will soon be eligible for Classic Game of the Week.

1300
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:24,000
Like it's that long they've been talking about it.

1301
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:25,000
Anyway.

1302
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:32,000
And yeah, RunJumpStomp says Yoshi P said they would port it to all platforms if all platform holders would agree to cross play.

1303
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:39,000
And then Shad or Shane is in chat saying I'm pretty sure Yoshi P recently said it's Microsoft that's holding off an Xbox One port.

1304
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:40,000
That's so shocking to me.

1305
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
What do they have to lose?

1306
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:47,000
But then Microsoft went and scored that deal with PSO2 so I don't- it's weird.

1307
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:48,000
I don't-

1308
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:51,000
I'm surprised that they wouldn't want Final Fantasy 14.

1309
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:52,000
I would be, yeah.

1310
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:56,000
Especially when they went out of their way to get Final Fantasy 11.

1311
01:01:56,000 --> 01:02:02,000
Again, you want to talk about like the first cross platform game that you could do Sony, Microsoft, and PCs?

1312
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
That was Final Fantasy 11.

1313
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:08,000
Like cross platform was not an issue back in 2006?

1314
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:11,000
Well they all connected through the Play Online servers.

1315
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:12,000
I know, I know.

1316
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:13,000
That doesn't really count.

1317
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:14,000
Yeah.

1318
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:15,000
Anyway, alright.

1319
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:16,000
We're going to move on though.

1320
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:17,000
We're going to move on.

1321
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,000
We could talk about cross play but the reality is we don't really know.

1322
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:20,000
We're not in those boardrooms.

1323
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:26,000
We can only kind of take our best guesses through what has been said in various interviews.

1324
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:32,000
Anyway, moving on to the Epic Game Store and a game called Ooblets.

1325
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:39,000
Because Ooblets has recently announced that they will be exclusive to the Epic Game Store temporarily.

1326
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:46,000
Epic offered the development team of two people some financial incentives that would cover Ooblet

1327
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:51,000
and what it would sell as if it were selling on all the different PC stores.

1328
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:54,000
So, you know, it's a financial move, especially when it's two people putting it together.

1329
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
It's like, you know, somebody's showing you some coin.

1330
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:59,000
It's a financial move that is going to put bread on the table for a little while, right?

1331
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:00,000
So it makes sense.

1332
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:03,000
And that can help them grow their company and do more stuff.

1333
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:11,000
But, oh my God, people got terrible about this because there are some people out there that really hate the Epic Game Store.

1334
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:15,000
Yes, but I'll let you finish.

1335
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:22,000
But there's, I think it's not necessarily the announcement that it's how they announced it.

1336
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:23,000
Okay, fair, fair.

1337
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:24,000
So let's move on then.

1338
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:30,000
So there's an announcement that occurred and it was on the Patreon community.

1339
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
So I can see, so people were paying money for this.

1340
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
It's kind of like the Shenmue 3 thing, right?

1341
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:35,000
Well, not necessarily that.

1342
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:38,000
It's just, yeah, read through some of it.

1343
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:41,000
Okay, I will.

1344
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:49,000
The developer said they got thousands, if not tens of thousands of hateful, threatening messages across every platform nonstop.

1345
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:54,000
And then Epic actually came to their defense and kind of said, you know,

1346
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
we've shared our views about the game business and companies in it.

1347
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,000
We support the game community's right to speak freely.

1348
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:04,000
The announcements of Ooblets highlighted a disturbing trend, which is growing and undermining healthy public discourse.

1349
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:08,000
And that's the coordinated and deliberate creation and promotion of false information,

1350
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:13,000
including fake screenshots, videos and technical analysis accompanied by harassment of partners,

1351
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:17,000
promotion of hateful themes and intimidation of those with opposing views.

1352
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:22,000
Epic is working with many game developers and other partners to build what we believe is a healthier

1353
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:26,000
and more competitive multi-store world for the future and so on and so on.

1354
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:29,000
Now, if you want to go to the announcement, I'm trying to load it on their website right now.

1355
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,000
Well, I'll save you the time.

1356
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:36,000
So here's how they announced it and why I think people were kind of a little bit angry about it.

1357
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:40,000
So they basically said, you know, here's what these epic folks are doing.

1358
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:44,000
First, they teach every kid in the world these obnoxious dances,

1359
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:50,000
and now they're offering funding to game developers in exchange for PC exclusivity on their game store.

1360
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:53,000
This is exactly what Mark's warned us about.

1361
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:57,000
Just imagine if other companies got it in their heads and offered funding in exchange for exclusives.

1362
01:04:57,000 --> 01:05:02,000
What would it be next? Game consoles paying for games to be exclusive on their consoles?

1363
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:06,000
Netflix paying for exclusive shows? Newspapers paying for exclusive articles?

1364
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:09,000
Maybe some sort of late capitalist dystopia.

1365
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,000
OK, so it's very like talking down.

1366
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:17,000
You could just say, hey, instead of being assholes like that, you could just say, hey,

1367
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:21,000
we made this decision because we are just two people and it's good.

1368
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:25,000
You know, we want to be exclusive. So we were using this extra capital to do this.

1369
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:29,000
I think people will be more forgiving than that instead of talking down to people.

1370
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:33,000
Yeah, and I will agree now that you've kind of put that in context, like that was a horrible way to deliver that message.

1371
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:38,000
Absolutely. But you don't need to meet crap with worse crap.

1372
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
You know what I mean? Like that's where this is a problem.

1373
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:46,000
Like it's yes. Right. Yeah. You need to be told like this shitty tone, guys, like like fix it, fix it up.

1374
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:53,000
But like going to the extent of spreading fake information, false screenshots, hate mail, death threats,

1375
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:59,000
all the bullshit you see on Twitter and all that stuff like that is when it's like, y'all like y'all calm down.

1376
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:04,000
Yeah. Like if they just don't like, you know, you know, you know, the best thing you can do.

1377
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:11,000
It's not a tweet. It's not like the best thing you can do. If you're mad, don't buy it.

1378
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:16,000
And not a concept. And that's all they had to do is like just exclude that like paragraph that was in there.

1379
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:20,000
And it would be a decent announcement because the rest of it beyond that, like talks about what they're doing,

1380
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:25,000
what Epic is doing for them, what it means to them, you know, and all that stuff.

1381
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:28,000
And like how how it all like affects positively.

1382
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:33,000
But like it's that asshole tone in the beginning that when people already don't like those types of announcements,

1383
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:38,000
I don't think it's such a big deal when it's like an indie game like that coming to a platform exclusively.

1384
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:46,000
That's fine because you understand that it's more of like the triple A companies that you don't need the extra Epic Games funding.

1385
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:54,000
You know, you're not an independent studio that's trying to, you know, scrap or scrape together some money so that you can actually release your game.

1386
01:06:54,000 --> 01:07:01,000
You know, when you're take two or something, you're releasing Borderlands three on the platform and you really just getting some extra points.

1387
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:05,000
You know, as far as the profit you're going to make, that's a little bit different.

1388
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:10,000
But it doesn't help, though, when people are already sensitive about that stuff and you put in that tone.

1389
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:19,000
But at the same time, you shouldn't, you know, people that are fans or gamers or whatever of that shit shouldn't be just harassing people over it.

1390
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,000
Because come on, that's ridiculous.

1391
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:27,000
S2100Matt in chat says, if you're mad, move on. The industry will continue to move on with or without you.

1392
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:32,000
Questbuster says both sides are to blame, but the threats just played into their assessment of toxic gamers.

1393
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:37,000
Yeah, like, I mean, people, there are valid criticisms of this statement in there, for sure.

1394
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:49,000
But unfortunately, there's too many shitlords on the Internet that are doing the shit lordy thing that now like that is the thing that everybody can point at and go gamers are stupid, you know, and all that stuff.

1395
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:57,000
And that's that is part of the reason then why in the real world when shitty things happen, people are quick to blame gamers.

1396
01:07:57,000 --> 01:08:06,000
Like, I hate to say it, but it is that part of the culture that we're not rejecting harshly enough that is playing into that.

1397
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:13,000
I really believe that, you know, so again and again, I'm not saying I'm not saying like, oh, the Ooblets guys are totally in the right.

1398
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:16,000
No, like they it's just I just don't buy it.

1399
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:23,000
But once again, though, it's not the first company that's made a bad press release and we're talking like two people.

1400
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:28,000
I'm sure they don't have a press person or a social media person. Mistakes happen.

1401
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:31,000
So they're fine with it. They want it like a Facebook.

1402
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:38,000
You know, when I get the sense of humor in it, too, like I'm like I read that and I'm like, I mean, I get your point.

1403
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:41,000
I'm not like bent out of shape about it. I really care either.

1404
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:48,000
I mean, the game is cute. It's so epic exclusive. I kind of over that whole epic exclusive stuff.

1405
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:53,000
Like, oh, no, it's not in my Steam library. I'm kind of over it at this point.

1406
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:58,000
But why are people so bent out of shape over something so small?

1407
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:02,000
I don't understand. I'm kind of with Bobby a little bit on this, though, about his apprehensions about epic.

1408
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:05,000
Like I have an epic store account to just hoard free games.

1409
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:10,000
That's basically what I do. But Bobby, you know, makes a point about why he doesn't buy games.

1410
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:14,000
I don't buy anything on epic game store simply because they don't have any wallet cards I could buy at a store.

1411
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:19,000
I have to give them my credit card info and I don't trust any gaming company with my credit card info.

1412
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:26,000
And like, I respect that in this day and age of data breaches, when the companies who track breaches get breached.

1413
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:29,000
You know, those types of things, when it's that reductive.

1414
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,000
Yo, Doug, I hear like breaches.

1415
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:38,000
Exactly. Like Equifax, the credit monitoring company gets, in fact, breached, you know, because there's that whole get your $4.

1416
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:41,000
Yeah, right. That whole thing. Like, I get it.

1417
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:44,000
Like, you don't want to trust your information out there anywhere.

1418
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:50,000
And, you know, I had money stolen on Xbox 360, certainly as a direct result of these types of breaches.

1419
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:56,000
So, like, I get it. Yeah. She Hulk in chat says, trust no one.

1420
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,000
X-Files. Yeah, for sure. Right.

1421
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:03,000
Questbuster says, I have an epic account, but like Rob, it's only for the freebies.

1422
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:04,000
Yeah, exactly.

1423
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:05,000
I purchased a game.

1424
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:10,000
Actually, sorry, I have to say this. Bobby says, I mean, my EGS account has already been hacked once and they got nothing.

1425
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:16,000
Something like that happened to me. Somebody connected my Epic account to a PlayStation account that wasn't mine.

1426
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:20,000
Because when I went to go do it, it was like, you're already connected to an account. I'm like, who the fuck is this?

1427
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:26,000
So I kind of think my Epic account got breached at some point too.

1428
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:33,000
So, like, I get it. Like, I, in fact, I would encourage people don't give Epic your credit card number. Seriously.

1429
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:36,000
So I just use PayPal through it. Because I've got two factor on PayPal.

1430
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:37,000
Yeah.

1431
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:43,000
And I don't have, I don't have the automatic like, so, you know, pay, make it easier for PayPal to charge your account.

1432
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:48,000
You know, don't just let it like, just do its thing. You know? No, I just two factor everything.

1433
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:53,000
Pop culture in chat says, you know, Arrow works for a credit card processor, but it's not y'all's problem.

1434
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:55,000
Like that, you're not the problem in your company.

1435
01:10:55,000 --> 01:11:01,000
Your companies aren't the reason the breaches are happening because of like crap security on Epic's side and things of that sort.

1436
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:05,000
You know, so, you know, we already, and I think we're going to do it again tonight.

1437
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:12,000
We already have read different companies in the gaming industry that you would think would do better with information not being able to do so.

1438
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:21,000
You know, so just potentially, because I don't have the facts to back it up, except the fact that it happened to me, potentially add Epic into that, you know?

1439
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:25,000
So, one more comment and then we'll move on to the classic game of the week.

1440
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:29,000
SHO 100 Matt in chat says, gamers need to be the better person in today's age.

1441
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:35,000
Now more than ever, terrible shit is happening all around us. Exclusivity in gaming.

1442
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:41,000
That's like my arch nemesis word, isn't the type of thing worth getting upset over.

1443
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:43,000
So, all right.

1444
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:50,000
And Bobby Blackwell also says, I do thank Epic gamers for beta testing Borderlands 3 ahead of its launch next March.

1445
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:54,000
All right. You get the joke there, right?

1446
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:57,000
I was checking. Y'all got the joke, right?

1447
01:11:57,000 --> 01:12:01,000
Okay. Let's move on to a time when the jokes were simpler.

1448
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:04,000
We're going to go to the classic game of the week.

1449
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:12,000
And every week here on the show, usually when she's here, Dark Sakura will step into the gaming vault and find a game that she thinks, hey, you guys should be checking out this game this week.

1450
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:18,000
But Dark Sakura, as we know, is taking a trip down memory lane with the 80s hits from Weird Al Yankovic.

1451
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:19,000
That's why she's not here tonight.

1452
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:24,000
So in her place tonight, usually I try to tape something in advance with a special guest.

1453
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:34,000
But because of all the other stuff I've been doing today, namely a 30 minute immunity challenge, among other things, I didn't get around to doing that segment with somebody else.

1454
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:37,000
So it's been a little while since Loki got to pick.

1455
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:43,000
Yes. And unfortunately, I picked a good one first and then I thought of all these other ones afterwards.

1456
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:45,000
I'm like, oh man, I should have done those.

1457
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:47,000
I thought you meant the first one that you shot down.

1458
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:56,000
I shot down his first pick because it's a pick where I said, no, that needs to be the game that's like on the last OLR or on some big number OLR game.

1459
01:12:56,000 --> 01:13:01,000
No, I'm not talking about that. I'm talking about like the other weird things I thought of after the fact.

1460
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:03,000
But this is a really good one that you picked.

1461
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:06,000
So when you texted me this, I'm like, oh, this is perfect.

1462
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:09,000
So the game that we picked, I can describe it in one word.

1463
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:10,000
Rush.

1464
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:13,000
That's right. That's the sound I would hear every time I would go.

1465
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:18,000
Oh, I just want to say I don't know how that happened. My template is muted over.

1466
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:22,000
No, no. The classic game noise is just very low.

1467
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:27,000
It's actually the long play is by classic game videos, not the name displayed there, but their watermark is on the corner there.

1468
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:29,000
Sorry, guys. It's a typo on my end.

1469
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:40,000
Anyways, that's the sound I used to hear every time I'd go play Cuzar because we had a San Francisco Rush Extreme Racing machine, actually two of them there to play.

1470
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:48,000
And so San Francisco Rush Extreme Racing was a game that was put out by Atari Games published by Midway back in 1996.

1471
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:55,000
It later then came out on consoles, of course, of the Nintendo 64 and 97 and finally PlayStation 98.

1472
01:13:55,000 --> 01:14:08,000
Of course, San Francisco Rush was a very stunt based racing game set in San Francisco with all sorts of crazy obstacle courses and shortcuts to go through.

1473
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:15,000
Lots of air and all sorts of fun stuff. And I wasn't very good at it, but it was a lot of fun.

1474
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:23,000
The game was they had several different versions of the game. They kind of all came out around the same time each other.

1475
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:27,000
The one I played the most was actually San Francisco Rush The Rock.

1476
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:33,000
So that version featured a set of tracks in Alcatraz, which are pretty fun as well.

1477
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:46,000
That was in 97. And then, of course, they also had a version that came out in 98 that I was unaware of called San Francisco Rush The Rock Wave Net, which apparently supported online multiplayer.

1478
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:49,000
All the way back in 98. That's kind of crazy.

1479
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:57,000
So San Francisco Rush was built around the 3DFX Voodoo Graphics dual chip.

1480
01:14:57,000 --> 01:15:00,000
Voodoo Economics?

1481
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:05,000
It was, yeah, it apparently had cars going 150 to 160 miles per hour.

1482
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:12,000
And they, of course, created an alternate version of San Francisco for the game.

1483
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:18,000
Some really great ports. So the Nintendo 64 edition, I remember playing that one quite a bit.

1484
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:24,000
The PlayStation one as well. They also did it as part of the Midway Treasures, volume of three.

1485
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:30,000
I believe it had all the racing games in there. That came out in GameCube, PlayStation 2, and Xbox at one time.

1486
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:33,000
And I think I even have the PC version on that.

1487
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:40,000
Of course, this followed up later on. They had an Nintendo 64 sequel, Rush 2 Extreme Racing USA.

1488
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:46,000
That was released in 1998. And, of course, the arcade follow up, San Francisco Rush 2049.

1489
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:51,000
And that came out later on in the Dreamcast and Nintendo 64 as well.

1490
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:57,000
And then, finally, they had LA Rush, which was released in 2005. I never played that one.

1491
01:15:57,000 --> 01:16:06,000
But, yeah, got some decent reviews and I definitely spent a lot of money on this game.

1492
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:09,000
And had a lot of fun playing it.

1493
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:12,000
But, yeah, that's my pick. San Francisco Rush.

1494
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:18,000
And we really need, like, an updated version of this to come out, aside from 2049.

1495
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:22,000
I think they do have, actually, a newer one now that's one of those...

1496
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:28,000
I don't know. I get that confused with Cruis'n USA or the Cruis'n series, but they need a new one.

1497
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:32,000
Besides, the targets aren't really making anything decent.

1498
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:33,000
Maybe this will be...

1499
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:35,000
Oh, they have their own little computer, though.

1500
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:40,000
I was about to say, maybe this will be something that comes out on their new console.

1501
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:47,000
But, yeah. So, the Classic Game of the Week, San Francisco Rush, Extreme Racing.

1502
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,000
Are you done there?

1503
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:54,000
Sorry, I'm sending Jamie a text message real quick while she's at the concert.

1504
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:58,000
There was a very kind gesture in our chat room that I want to make sure she knows about,

1505
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,000
so I'm trying to text her right now. So, anyway.

1506
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,000
Well, you don't have anything else to say about the game?

1507
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,000
I don't have anything else to say. I wonder if this is something...

1508
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:09,000
They should run this for Awesome Games Done Quick.

1509
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:13,000
I would love to see, like, someone actually take all the shortcuts in these.

1510
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:15,000
Did you ever play, like, the home versions on Nintendo 64?

1511
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:18,000
I played the Nintendo 64 one, yeah, quite a bit, actually.

1512
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:23,000
That was because it was actually a really good port of it, and I think that was the Rush to Rock one.

1513
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:27,000
I just remember trying to play this, like, every time I'd go to try to hit that tunnel right there,

1514
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:28,000
it always crashed in the roof.

1515
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:33,000
It was just... That was one of the things with the driving cabinets that they had in here,

1516
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:36,000
that, like, it was very hard to steer those cars.

1517
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:40,000
I mean, they were just... Yeah, that was me pretty much the entire time,

1518
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:42,000
just crashing into the walls.

1519
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:45,000
But, yeah, it was a fun game.

1520
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:47,000
You know what game you could have picked for racing?

1521
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:50,000
F-Zero, because I don't think we... I don't think... Or F-Zero GX.

1522
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,000
I don't think it's... I'm pretty sure we picked F-Zero.

1523
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,000
Have we? Oh, maybe. I don't know. All right.

1524
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:57,000
Anyway, no, but that's a really good pick. Like, I can't be mad about that, for sure.

1525
01:17:57,000 --> 01:18:00,000
So there it is, the classic game of the week. San Francisco Rush.

1526
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,000
Yes. All right. Anyway, let's move on.

1527
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:05,000
We've got plenty more show to go, plenty more stories to cover,

1528
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:08,000
and your calls a little later on on our Discord server

1529
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:11,000
over at vognetwork.com slash Discord.

1530
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,000
That's vognetwork.com slash Discord.

1531
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:15,000
First, some rapid fire news.

1532
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:19,000
So the first thing we have is they finally put out the final list

1533
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:23,000
of the PC Engine TurboGrafx-16 mini games that are going to be coming out.

1534
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:29,000
So, newly announced games that are going to be coming to those versions as well.

1535
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:32,000
So now we have, aside from everything that's been released so far,

1536
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:40,000
Dragon's Spirit, Galaga 88, the Genji and the Hyaki clans,

1537
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:48,000
The Legend of Valkyrie, Seirei Senshi Spriggan, and Spriggan Mark II,

1538
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:54,000
as well as they're going to be including Splatterhouse as well.

1539
01:18:54,000 --> 01:19:00,000
And it makes a total of 50 games that are going to be bundled with those now.

1540
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,000
So that's pretty awesome.

1541
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,000
March, I don't know.

1542
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:08,000
I didn't get in on that, but eh, what are you going to do?

1543
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:11,000
I did, and hearing this news makes me even happier.

1544
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:13,000
Now we get Splatterhouse too on top of all that,

1545
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:15,000
and there are some other good games in there too.

1546
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:17,000
I'm so pumped for this TurboGrafx.

1547
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:21,000
Never in my life have I been excited about a TurboGrafx thing, but I am tonight.

1548
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:23,000
So this is pretty exciting.

1549
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:27,000
So there is a brand new total conversion mod

1550
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:30,000
that's being done for Serious Sam Fusion,

1551
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:34,000
or I should say Serious Sam 3 is part of Serious Sam Fusion,

1552
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:40,000
and it is a total conversion that puts the game of Duke Nukem 3D in that engine.

1553
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:45,000
So it is a remake of Duke Nukem 3D, but here's the best part about it.

1554
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:50,000
So not only is it Duke Nukem 3D with better graphics and better gameplay,

1555
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:56,000
but they have expanded levels, new weapons, new music made just for the mod,

1556
01:19:56,000 --> 01:20:02,000
and VR support, and it looks fucking awesome.

1557
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:06,000
And the best part is it's free, so you can actually find it.

1558
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:12,000
It's called Serious Duke 3D, so go to the Serious Sam Fusion 2017.

1559
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:16,000
They have the beta version I think that you can get.

1560
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:21,000
And if you have Serious Sam 3, then you can download this mod for free,

1561
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:25,000
and it's linked within their forums that they have in Steam.

1562
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:29,000
But I've got to check this out. I think I have all the Serious Sam collection.

1563
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:32,000
I don't know if I have Fusion though, but I'll take a look at that.

1564
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:36,000
But it looked really good, so I'm really wanting to check this out.

1565
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:41,000
It looks actually, funny enough, better than what Gearbox would have done with this stuff.

1566
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:47,000
So before I get to my rapid-fire stories, I've been texting DarkSakura a little bit

1567
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:50,000
because of that very kind gesture from She-Hulk in our chat room.

1568
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:56,000
But DarkSakura actually texted me this very lovely picture.

1569
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:58,000
That's why I stood up for a minute here, so I can show it again.

1570
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:01,000
Very lovely picture of herself and Dan. There you go.

1571
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:04,000
They're at the Weirdo concert. You can see the empty seats behind them.

1572
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:07,000
So I don't think it started just yet. It probably starts at about 8 o'clock.

1573
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:13,000
So very lovely. What a handsome couple there. They look great.

1574
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:17,000
So good photo. Thank you, She-Hulk, because I probably would not have texted her

1575
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:20,000
if you hadn't provoked me to with that lovely gesture in our chat room.

1576
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:24,000
So there you go. Anyway, I'm sure they'll be having fun at the concert.

1577
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:30,000
RumJumpStompInChat says, when I saw Weird Al, he stayed after and met every single fan that wanted to.

1578
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:33,000
That sounds like such a weird Al thing to do. It really does.

1579
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:38,000
I remember when DarkSakura and I went to see Greg Proops,

1580
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:42,000
and he didn't have the hugest turnout here in SAC because his podcast was still new,

1581
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:48,000
and it was right around New Year's. I think it was the Saturday between Christmas and New Year's,

1582
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:51,000
and he was here, so he didn't have the hugest crowd.

1583
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:54,000
It was on a Thursday night, but DarkSakura and I went, and he was really cool.

1584
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,000
He came around and shook everybody's hand in the audience.

1585
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,000
It was like, thank you for being here. I'm Greg. Who are you?

1586
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,000
So I always thought that was a very classy move.

1587
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:03,000
I think he still does the smartest man in the world thing.

1588
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:08,000
He's had that podcast for forever. We went and saw that live once. It was a lot of fun.

1589
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:12,000
Bobby Blackwell says Penn and Teller also hang out in the lobby. That's really cool.

1590
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:17,000
I love it when people are... I think that's a very humble thing to do.

1591
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:24,000
But I also respect sometimes when folks are emotionally spent and they can't do that stuff.

1592
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:27,000
I don't think people should ever have an expectation,

1593
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:33,000
because I can totally respect when maybe a performer has put their all into a performance,

1594
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:39,000
and so they just don't have that emotional gas tank or whatever you want to call it to go out and see everybody.

1595
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:44,000
I totally respect that, but that is amazing these folks that can do that and do have that energy

1596
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:47,000
kind of going that extra mile. That's always really, really cool.

1597
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:51,000
Anyway, let's move on. Sorry, that was a random tangent, but it happens here on OLR.

1598
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:55,000
Getting into some other gaming news, a big tweet from Reggie Fils-Aime,

1599
01:22:55,000 --> 01:23:00,000
who ever since he kind of stepped down as head of Nintendo America,

1600
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:05,000
he has a Twitter account. He doesn't really tweet every day. He doesn't speak up all the time.

1601
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:08,000
I think he's just probably enjoying retirement and time with his kids.

1602
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:11,000
And he fucking earned it, so let him, right?

1603
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:16,000
But he showed up this week. I got something to say, pretty much.

1604
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:19,000
And so when Reggie speaks, y'all better fucking listen.

1605
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:25,000
And this has to do with a comment on deadly mass shootings and the violence in America

1606
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:28,000
and some of the blame that video games are taking for this.

1607
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:31,000
And Reggie Fils-Aime tweeted the following, and I quote,

1608
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:36,000
When the ill-informed are being critical of the gaming industry and community,

1609
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,000
this is a very powerful story.

1610
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:43,000
He had actually quote-tweeted a Jeff Keighley story about video games

1611
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:48,000
and bringing people together and actually helping to get somebody to get Canadian citizenship

1612
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:52,000
through the power of video games. So this was a quote-tweet for Reggie Fils-Aime.

1613
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:55,000
You can attach somebody else's tweet. So this is what that was.

1614
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:58,000
So anyway, this is a very powerful story.

1615
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:04,000
The facts are that countries with higher per capita gaming revenue have fewer gun shooting deaths,

1616
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:09,000
except the US, where 4% of the population own 43% of the guns.

1617
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:13,000
And you know, I don't want to step into gun debate tonight,

1618
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:18,000
but I think he does make that point, as a lot of people have said this point.

1619
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:21,000
Japan has the same video games we do.

1620
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:24,000
Most of the countries in Europe have the same video games we do.

1621
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:28,000
Australia, save for one or two, like Mortal Kombat and stuff,

1622
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,000
you know, some of those tragedy, or not tragedy, sorry,

1623
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:33,000
some of those controversies is the word I was looking for.

1624
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:37,000
Australia, for the most part, has the same video games we do, and so on and so on.

1625
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:42,000
These countries do not have the level of the problems we have.

1626
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:45,000
Yes, we all know there was a horrific incident that happened in New Zealand.

1627
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:48,000
It doesn't happen at the frequency that it's happening here.

1628
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:49,000
You know what I mean?

1629
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:55,000
Right, and we understand that, but it's pretty transparent why politicians are blaming video games,

1630
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:59,000
because they're getting paid by the NRA, they get money from the NRA.

1631
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:01,000
And they don't get money from video games.

1632
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:04,000
They don't get money from video games, and unfortunately they're beholden to money,

1633
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:09,000
and so they just blame video games because it's an old way of thinking, blaming other things.

1634
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:14,000
There's been so many things to blame violence on, like whether it was comic books,

1635
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:22,000
or rock and roll music, or movies, or TV, or video games, or whatever.

1636
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:28,000
I mean, Magic the Gathering, I mean, just all sorts of ridiculous things that people blame violence on,

1637
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:29,000
and it's never-

1638
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:31,000
Oh, Bobby in chat says D&D. I remember-

1639
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:32,000
D&D, yes.

1640
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:36,000
When my mom was like, you're playing Dungeons and Dragons, you can't rob.

1641
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,000
Don't use your imagination, at least of violence!

1642
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:48,000
I know, but what's interesting to me is because I do think my mom learned a lot in the years that she was alive that I was growing up.

1643
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:56,000
I think she learned a lot through me, and I think my mom in her late 70s before she passed,

1644
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:59,000
I think if she looked back at some of the things she had said when I was growing up like that,

1645
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:04,000
I think she would go, at least he wasn't doing drugs.

1646
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:08,000
That would have honestly been what she would have fallen on.

1647
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:12,000
It's like, so he was playing D&D, at least he wasn't doing drugs, you know?

1648
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:21,000
It's stupid, and it really is, and unfortunately, if the government makes decisions about censoring video games,

1649
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:27,000
we're not going to see any change in the violence that's out there, and it's not going to make a difference.

1650
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:33,000
They just need to get the work that needs to be done, done.

1651
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:38,000
When everybody keeps saying, do something about the gun violence, do something about the guns, they need to do that.

1652
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:44,000
The problem is, the base that supports the people that are in power right now, they love their guns,

1653
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:50,000
and they won't have anybody telling them that guns are bad, because they're used as a threat.

1654
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:55,000
Oh, if these people get elected, they're going to take your guns away, and that's what it comes down to, is politics.

1655
01:26:55,000 --> 01:27:02,000
The cracks in all of that are starting to show, it's taken way too fucking long, but the cracks in that are finally starting to show.

1656
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:07,000
The governor of Ohio tried to give some speech right after all that.

1657
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:11,000
There were all of these people out there yelling, do something, do something, do something.

1658
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:14,000
They just started screaming during this whole thing, do something.

1659
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:17,000
And he pretty much was not able to give his speech, and you know what?

1660
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:23,000
The next day, he came out and said, I think maybe it's time to look at doing this type of thing.

1661
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:28,000
I don't remember the exact thing he proposed, but I don't remember if it was the extended background checks or something like that,

1662
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:34,000
but it took the people going out and being fucking pissed off to finally make that change.

1663
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:36,000
And it took way too long.

1664
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:42,000
And then when you had the president mimicking that, well, maybe we'll look at extending the background checks or whatever,

1665
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:47,000
then he gets a call from the NRA saying, that's not a good idea, you shouldn't be doing that,

1666
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:52,000
and then he walks it back because, hey, if you want our support, you're not going to do that.

1667
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:56,000
Anyway, I think Dark Titsia kind of wraps this up, to try to shift away from politics,

1668
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:59,000
Dark Titsia I think kind of wraps this up nicely with his comment in our chat saying,

1669
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:05,000
I didn't want to open this can of worms again, I just thought it was really great that Reggie would go to bat for us.

1670
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:07,000
And I absolutely agree, absolutely agree.

1671
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:13,000
You know, it's great that, because Reggie didn't have to say shit, he doesn't work in the video games industry anymore.

1672
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:20,000
Reggie can sit there sipping a drink out of a coconut on the Bahamas and the islands and not give a fuck about any of this,

1673
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:27,000
and he would be well within his rights to do so, but the fact that he is still, like, he's showing up from all that to say something about this,

1674
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:32,000
that's near and dear to his heart, like, as if we didn't love him enough, right?

1675
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:36,000
As if we didn't love Reggie enough, like, anyway, what a stud.

1676
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:40,000
Alright, anyway, that's all I can say about Reggie, what a stud.

1677
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:42,000
I think even heterosexual men can agree, what a stud.

1678
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:44,000
Alright, moving on.

1679
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:52,000
Going to a completely different comment here on Sega Ages and the Sega Ages collection.

1680
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:58,000
Space Harrier and Puyo Puyo are games that will be coming out on August 22nd in the West.

1681
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:03,000
So, yeah, the Sega Ages lineup, very cool, kind of adds a little something to these classic games.

1682
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:08,000
Obviously, Puyo Puyo was also Kirby's Dream Machine, or was it Kirby's?

1683
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:15,000
I might add, I think I mixed the titles, Mr. Robot, or Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine and Kirby's Dream?

1684
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:16,000
Kirby, or was it?

1685
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:19,000
Kirby's Avalanche! Oh my god, why is that name escaping?

1686
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:22,000
Like, you even say it in the beginning of that game, Kirby's Avalanche!

1687
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:23,000
Anyways, sorry!

1688
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:28,000
I'm sure Act F is, like, screaming the name in chat right now, but I did figure it out before I read chat.

1689
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:33,000
Okay, so anyway, Puyo Puyo is the game all of those are based on, and that will be very cool.

1690
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:38,000
I mean, I think a lot of people saw the Puyo Puyo Cross Tetris was out recently on Switch too, and PS4.

1691
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:43,000
So Puyo Puyo is making its way to Sega Ages, and of course Space Harrier, which, you know,

1692
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:46,000
Dark Soccer is one of her favorite quotes, the welcome to the fantasy zone, get ready.

1693
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:51,000
That all comes from Space Harrier, so it's a bummer she's not here tonight to read this story herself,

1694
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:56,000
but I'm sure she will have her hands all over this come August 22nd, so that's going to be very cool.

1695
01:29:56,000 --> 01:30:00,000
They will be out on the Nintendo Switch coming August 22nd.

1696
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,000
I think I'll have to pick that up.

1697
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:08,000
Space Harrier really reminds me of a game called 3D World Runner, which I'm sure was, like, inspired by,

1698
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:13,000
you know, I'm sure there's a lot, but I happen to play the other one first.

1699
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:16,000
So, but, like, Space Harrier is very cool, so I kind of want to check that out.

1700
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:19,000
That might be a game I can stream, we'll see.

1701
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:24,000
Anyway, let's move on. Let's talk about what is in stores this week.

1702
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:28,000
Let's travel around the world and check out video games coming to a store near you.

1703
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:31,000
Well, we've got Friday the 13th, the game coming out on Nintendo Switch.

1704
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:33,000
Oh, yeah, finally I'm making a way to the Switch, yeah.

1705
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:37,000
Because the 13th falls on this week, that's why they're releasing it.

1706
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:43,000
We have the Bard's Tale trilogy on Xbox One, Rebel Galaxy Outlaw on PC,

1707
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:47,000
Ion Fury on PC, Mac, and Linux.

1708
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:52,000
We've got a Vasara collection on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

1709
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:56,000
And finally, the Grandia HD collection on Nintendo Switch.

1710
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:59,000
All right, not sure what's going on in Japan this week,

1711
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:01,000
but it seems like it's kind of a slower week.

1712
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:04,000
We don't really have a lot of releases on the PlayStation 4.

1713
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:06,000
They don't really ramp up until August 22nd,

1714
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:08,000
so the PlayStation 4 is pretty quiet in Japan.

1715
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:14,000
Taking a peek at the Nintendo Switch, I don't see anything out there either.

1716
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:16,000
Like, there's some peripherals and things,

1717
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:18,000
but they don't really pick up until this 22nd either.

1718
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:20,000
I don't know if there's holidays or what have you going on,

1719
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:22,000
but it's just a very slow time of the year,

1720
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:26,000
so no Japanese releases outside of just minor hardware

1721
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:29,000
and things like that to talk about right now.

1722
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:31,000
So there you go.

1723
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:33,000
Let's move on to the UK, Loki.

1724
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:35,000
All right, not much coming out of the UK either.

1725
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:38,000
We've got Yu-Gi-Oh! Legacy of the Duelist Link Evolution

1726
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:41,000
coming out on Nintendo Switch, and that is it.

1727
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:43,000
All right, it must be slow.

1728
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:45,000
But I mean, August isn't typically a big time.

1729
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:47,000
I feel like around Labor Day.

1730
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:49,000
We're going to ramp up for September.

1731
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:50,000
That's true.

1732
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:51,000
But once we start to get into September,

1733
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:53,000
it's going to really start to ramp up again,

1734
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:55,000
so that certainly makes sense.

1735
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:59,000
All right, sorry, I misclicked on the little story bar

1736
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:01,000
on the right-hand side, so we're behind a little bit.

1737
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:03,000
So we're going to move on from world release dates

1738
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:05,000
and head on into our mailbag.

1739
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:07,000
Every week, we invite your e-mails over at

1740
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:10,000
participate at orangeloungeradio.com,

1741
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:12,000
and we read some of our favorite e-mails here on the show.

1742
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:15,000
Actually, this week, we really only have one e-mail,

1743
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:18,000
so let's get to it over at participate at orangeloungeradio.com.

1744
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:20,000
Robert M. with a follow-up to last week,

1745
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:21,000
when we were talking about Pokémon Go

1746
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:24,000
and some of the new filtering systems in Pokémon Go.

1747
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:25,000
Robert M. starts off this week,

1748
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:27,000
thank you very much for the advice for Pokémon Go.

1749
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:31,000
I did find that I have three four-star Pokémon,

1750
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:33,000
which I marked as favorites.

1751
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:34,000
You're going to tell us that

1752
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:36,000
and then not tell us what Pokémon they were?

1753
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:38,000
I'm so disappointed.

1754
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:39,000
All right, oh well.

1755
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:42,000
I will say I got a second Sentret

1756
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:44,000
that's a perfect Sentret this week,

1757
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:46,000
so I have two perfect Sentrets.

1758
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:48,000
I mean, of all the freaking Pokémon to have perfects,

1759
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:49,000
I get that one.

1760
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:50,000
Oh well.

1761
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:52,000
Anyway, Robert M. continues,

1762
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:55,000
as far as other gaming stuffs,

1763
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:57,000
I have become pretty hooked on the Switch port

1764
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:59,000
of Lethal League Blaze.

1765
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:01,000
It's been out since what?

1766
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:03,000
October on Windows,

1767
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:05,000
more recently having a Mac port,

1768
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:07,000
along with the original.

1769
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:09,000
Have any of you checked this one out?

1770
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:10,000
Thanks again.

1771
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:11,000
And that is from Robert M.

1772
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:12,000
I must admit,

1773
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:14,000
I don't know a lot about Lethal League Blaze,

1774
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:15,000
so I'm actually trying to pull up

1775
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:17,000
a little more information on this right now.

1776
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:20,000
It is a projectile fighting game, apparently,

1777
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:23,000
that's available on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch,

1778
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:25,000
and of course, as was mentioned there,

1779
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:27,000
Windows and Mac OS.

1780
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:32,000
So yeah, it looks like it's a high-speed ball game

1781
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:34,000
with different characters.

1782
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:37,000
And yeah, interesting.

1783
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:40,000
I'm trying to look at the description.

1784
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:42,000
Something on Google caught my eye here

1785
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:43,000
when I Googled this game.

1786
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:46,000
I have to see if it really says this.

1787
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:49,000
Hold on here.

1788
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:51,000
Okay, when I Google it,

1789
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:55,000
the little preview on Nintendo's site...

1790
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:56,000
Hold on, I gotta go back to this,

1791
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:57,000
because this is really interesting.

1792
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:59,000
So I Googled the name of the game.

1793
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:00,000
Yeah, okay.

1794
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,000
So look, this little preview here of Nintendo's site.

1795
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:03,000
It says,

1796
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:07,000
Lethal League Blaze is an intense high-speed ball game

1797
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:10,000
with unique characters, out-of-sight sounds,

1798
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:12,000
and none of that weak shit.

1799
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:14,000
Yeah, it's actually...

1800
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:16,000
Lethal League is pretty awesome.

1801
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:17,000
Hold on, hold on.

1802
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:20,000
Who got the word shit on a Nintendo website?

1803
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:21,000
That's what I want to know.

1804
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:23,000
Where did that shit come from?

1805
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:25,000
Literally, where did that shit come from?

1806
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:29,000
I don't know.

1807
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:31,000
And now I'm looking at the site itself,

1808
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:33,000
and it's telling me that my computer is not running

1809
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:36,000
a good enough browser, and I need to upgrade and so forth.

1810
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:38,000
But that is so funny.

1811
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:40,000
Is that like a user comment or something?

1812
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:42,000
What I like about Lethal League Blaze,

1813
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:44,000
and one of the things, actually,

1814
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:48,000
I have one of the tracks on my rotation that I listen to.

1815
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:53,000
So Hideki Naganuma does music on there,

1816
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:56,000
and you may remember him from...

1817
01:34:57,000 --> 01:34:59,000
No, I can't remember the damn god...

1818
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:01,000
Fucking the roller skating...

1819
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:04,000
Oh, Jet Set.

1820
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:05,000
Jet Set Radio, thank you.

1821
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:07,000
Yes, so you may remember him from Jet Set Radio,

1822
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:08,000
or from 2DX.

1823
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:10,000
He also did songs in 2DX as well,

1824
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:12,000
but he has a song in there called

1825
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:14,000
Ain't Nothin' Like...

1826
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:16,000
What was it?

1827
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:19,000
Was it Ain't Nothin' Like...

1828
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:21,000
Well, you can tell that that's gonna be the tone, though,

1829
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:22,000
like a Jet Set...

1830
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:23,000
That's a game.

1831
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:25,000
Oh my god, Sega's AAA announcement.

1832
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:27,000
Oh my god, Loki, Loki, Loki.

1833
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:28,000
Sega's AAA announcement.

1834
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:30,000
What if? What if?

1835
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:31,000
That'd be cool.

1836
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:32,000
A new Jet Set game.

1837
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:35,000
And it's AAA because the music is gonna be off the charts.

1838
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:37,000
Oh, now look, I'm getting my hopes up.

1839
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:39,000
This is me getting my hopes up live.

1840
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:41,000
Now I want Sega to announce a new Jet Set game.

1841
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:43,000
Oh my god, that'd be so amazing.

1842
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:45,000
It's probably gonna be like a new Dead or Alive.

1843
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:46,000
Yeah.

1844
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:49,000
SSG100Matt and Chad said the exact same thing

1845
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:50,000
at the same time.

1846
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:54,000
What if that AAA game is Jet Set in that series?

1847
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:57,000
Hey, you know what they say, SSG100Matt,

1848
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:58,000
great minds think like me.

1849
01:35:58,000 --> 01:35:59,000
Oh, no, Tecmo's Dead or Alive.

1850
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:00,000
What's the Sega one?

1851
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:01,000
Virtual Fighter?

1852
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:02,000
Yeah, Virtual Fighter.

1853
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:03,000
The Sega thing.

1854
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:04,000
Yeah.

1855
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:05,000
You never know.

1856
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:06,000
All right.

1857
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:07,000
Dark Tetsuya says,

1858
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:09,000
well, I think Hideki is composing for Streets of Rage 4.

1859
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:11,000
Yeah, I think so too.

1860
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:13,000
And Act Def bringing us down to reality saying,

1861
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:15,000
that would be amazing, but I don't think it's happening.

1862
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:16,000
Womp womp.

1863
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:19,000
But the game is really weird, so it's a fighting game,

1864
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:22,000
but with a baseball or something like that.

1865
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:24,000
So they're actually throwing this ball around

1866
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:25,000
as you're fighting.

1867
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:26,000
It's really weird.

1868
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:28,000
But it looks pretty cool.

1869
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:30,000
Speaking of Sega letting us down,

1870
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:32,000
you remember that Actraiser clone they were doing?

1871
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:33,000
Yeah.

1872
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:34,000
Yeah, I'm hearing it.

1873
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:35,000
Yeah, I know.

1874
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:36,000
I'm hearing this ain't it.

1875
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:37,000
Garbage.

1876
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:38,000
This ain't it.

1877
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:39,000
Spiritual six.

1878
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:40,000
Ain't it.

1879
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:41,000
That's a bummer.

1880
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:43,000
I still kind of want to try it and see for myself

1881
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:45,000
because, you know, I don't remember Actraiser being

1882
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:47,000
on people's top 10 list back in the day.

1883
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:49,000
Like that was kind of one of those like underground

1884
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:50,000
sort of like titles.

1885
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:53,000
But a lot of stuff I'm reading about the Sega thing.

1886
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:54,000
Yeah.

1887
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:56,000
It's a new Altered Beast.

1888
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:57,000
That's what the.

1889
01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:58,000
Yike.

1890
01:36:58,000 --> 01:36:59,000
Yike.

1891
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:00,000
All right.

1892
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:01,000
Moving on.

1893
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:03,000
Let's get to some more news.

1894
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:04,000
Loki.

1895
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:05,000
All right.

1896
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:09,000
So because as we were just talking about the whole

1897
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:12,000
gun debate and everything and with everybody blaming

1898
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:15,000
video games for the violence,

1899
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:17,000
Walmart does the most Walmart thing ever.

1900
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:19,000
And they decided that, hey, guess what?

1901
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:21,000
We're going to remove all violent video game signage

1902
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:26,000
in the store so that we don't we want to any signing

1903
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:29,000
or display that contains violent images or aggressive

1904
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:30,000
behavior needs to come down.

1905
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:33,000
So remove, turn off, cancel.

1906
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:36,000
You know, anything that has to do with that stuff

1907
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:39,000
because of these mass shootings that have been going on.

1908
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:42,000
We're still going to sell guns,

1909
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:44,000
but remove those video game signs.

1910
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:47,000
Just so you know, no one gets offended.

1911
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:50,000
I think I mean, if they don't want to advertise

1912
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:52,000
or promote certain games, you know,

1913
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:53,000
they are within their rights.

1914
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:56,000
I just I'm disappointed that they have played into

1915
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:59,000
this narrative that is false.

1916
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:02,000
That certain people are putting out there about video games

1917
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:04,000
and the effect that it has on people with no proof

1918
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:05,000
to back that up.

1919
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:09,000
Especially when, again, video games are not something

1920
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:11,000
unique to the United States of America.

1921
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:15,000
These same video games are in Canada, Australia,

1922
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:18,000
Britain, Scotland, Japan.

1923
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:19,000
The list goes on and on.

1924
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:20,000
You get the point.

1925
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:22,000
And they don't have these same problems

1926
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:23,000
in these other places.

1927
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:24,000
Yet we have them here.

1928
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:27,000
Well, so it's just it's just disappointing that

1929
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:30,000
Walmart kind of got on that bandwagon, so to speak.

1930
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:31,000
Well, on top of that, also,

1931
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:37,000
there was supposed to be some sort of what was it?

1932
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:39,000
I don't know if it was an no, it wasn't anthem.

1933
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:44,000
It was the there was supposed to be some other like

1934
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:48,000
online competition that was going to be around.

1935
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:49,000
I can't remember the name of the game.

1936
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:51,000
But anyways, they were like postponing it again

1937
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:52,000
because of the mass shootings.

1938
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:55,000
And it was funny because like I was watching Jim Sterling

1939
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:57,000
talking about, you know, these mass shootings

1940
01:38:57,000 --> 01:38:59,000
and stuff and how they're postponing this tournament

1941
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:00,000
because of that.

1942
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:03,000
He's like, so what are they going to do next week

1943
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:04,000
when the next mass shooting happens

1944
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:06,000
or the next week when the next mass shooting happens

1945
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:07,000
or the week after that?

1946
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:09,000
They're just going to keep pushing this tournament

1947
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:11,000
down the road because of these mass shootings.

1948
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:13,000
It's not going to change anything

1949
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:16,000
because game violence doesn't have any bearing

1950
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:18,000
on this mass shooting stuff.

1951
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:20,000
Now, Dr. Suya in chat says,

1952
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:22,000
don't they only sell the clean versions of albums

1953
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:23,000
or am I remembering it wrong?

1954
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:24,000
No, they used to.

1955
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:26,000
That was the thing that they used to do.

1956
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:27,000
I don't think they do that anymore.

1957
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:28,000
Well, I think in general,

1958
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:30,000
they got out of the music business.

1959
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:32,000
They still sell music, but it's very little.

1960
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:35,000
Even like movies is very, very skilled back.

1961
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:37,000
Because a lot of that went digital.

1962
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:39,000
And I'm sure games are going to go that same way, too,

1963
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:41,000
as more and more of that goes digital.

1964
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:42,000
Yeah, eventually.

1965
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:43,000
You know what else is kind of weird

1966
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:44,000
about this whole story in a very like

1967
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:46,000
it's a small world kind of way?

1968
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:48,000
Like the guy that broke this on Twitter

1969
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:50,000
and had the copy of the Walmart announcement

1970
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:51,000
and all that.

1971
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:52,000
Yeah, longtime Twitter friend of mine.

1972
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:53,000
I was like the second or third person.

1973
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:54,000
I like that tweet.

1974
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:55,000
Yeah, I know, right?

1975
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:57,000
It's a weird like small world type of thing.

1976
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:59,000
I don't know where he got it.

1977
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:02,000
I have a theory, but it's not within my,

1978
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:04,000
it's not my business at all to say.

1979
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:05,000
But yeah, I just thought that,

1980
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:06,000
I thought that was interesting

1981
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:08,000
because I remember seeing that tweet.

1982
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:10,000
And I remember, I think I might've even retweeted it

1983
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:12,000
because I was like, very, I was like, God,

1984
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:14,000
I was like, geez, Louis, you know,

1985
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:16,000
I'm just rolling my eyes again.

1986
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:19,000
Like, you know, video games getting blamed for things.

1987
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:20,000
And then what is this?

1988
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:21,000
What year is this?

1989
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:23,000
Suddenly I'm reading a story on NPR

1990
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:25,000
and they like linked to that same tweet.

1991
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:28,000
And I was like, oh, I know.

1992
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:29,000
I'm happy for him though

1993
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:31,000
because I think he's trying to like land a journalism.

1994
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:32,000
Like he's kind of like trying to find

1995
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:34,000
a journalism position and stuff now.

1996
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:36,000
So hopefully this will, in a weird way,

1997
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:38,000
bring some attention and maybe help him with that.

1998
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:42,000
So anyway, it's a weird aside,

1999
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:43,000
but you guys have to admit like,

2000
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:44,000
has that ever happened to you

2001
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:45,000
where like you're on a website

2002
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:47,000
and like you see a tweet or you see a thing

2003
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:49,000
and you're like, I know that person.

2004
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:52,000
Like that's the weird like kind of world we live in, right?

2005
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:53,000
Yeah.

2006
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:56,000
Anyway, let's see.

2007
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:58,000
Going to the chat for some of the comments.

2008
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:00,000
Bob Coffee says, music got scaled back,

2009
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:03,000
but games and PC gaming got scaled up.

2010
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:04,000
Interesting.

2011
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:07,000
ST100Matt says, I'm sure they will still green light

2012
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:10,000
during midnight and launches of Call of Duty and so forth.

2013
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:11,000
Oh yeah.

2014
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:12,000
Yeah.

2015
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:14,000
Kaishudo in chat says, there's a method to the madness.

2016
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:15,000
You have crazy people that want to copy

2017
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:17,000
the latest news headline.

2018
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:18,000
So it's smart to postpone it if you can.

2019
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:21,000
Just till it's out of the news cycle.

2020
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:26,000
But at the same time, you know, it's,

2021
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:30,000
then maybe, you know, I know, of course,

2022
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:31,000
we can't stop selling guns.

2023
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:34,000
It's just, we can't do that.

2024
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:36,000
Anyway, let's move on.

2025
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:38,000
Let's let's go to somewhat lighter fare

2026
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:40,000
and talk about, let's talk about real problems.

2027
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:42,000
Oh, Ninja.

2028
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:43,000
There's even more to this.

2029
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:44,000
Okay.

2030
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:45,000
You get into the second half

2031
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:46,000
because I saw some of this in chat

2032
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:47,000
and I was like, wait a minute,

2033
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:48,000
you get into the second half.

2034
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:49,000
I'll tell the first half.

2035
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:50,000
Okay, here's the first half.

2036
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:53,000
So the first half is that, as you all know,

2037
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:54,000
Ninja left Twitch.

2038
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:56,000
I mean, here we are two weeks later,

2039
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:57,000
we're still talking about it,

2040
01:41:57,000 --> 01:41:59,000
but it's because he went over to Mixer.

2041
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:01,000
So he's over there now.

2042
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:04,000
I haven't watched, I didn't watch the streams before.

2043
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:05,000
I haven't watched them since the move,

2044
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:07,000
but I, once in a while I check out things on Mixer,

2045
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:09,000
especially like the official Microsoft stuff.

2046
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:12,000
You know, I have a few, I did like two broadcasts on Mixer.

2047
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:14,000
I always see a trailer for,

2048
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:18,000
or they have a loop that's in GameStop

2049
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:19,000
because we go there occasionally

2050
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:21,000
so my son can play the demos for...

2051
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:22,000
For Mixer?

2052
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:25,000
Yeah, Microsoft, they have a kiosk for Microsoft.

2053
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:27,000
No playable demos there, but we have,

2054
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:30,000
it's a trailer for Mixer

2055
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:32,000
and they have a trailer for that

2056
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:34,000
accessibility controller that they have,

2057
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:36,000
which I'm like, that's cool that they have a trailer there

2058
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:38,000
for that, but who's really buying that?

2059
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:40,000
No one's buying that here at GameStop right now,

2060
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:41,000
but it's cool that they have it.

2061
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:43,000
But there's a long trailer for Mixer.

2062
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:45,000
Showing like someone playing Forza Horizon.

2063
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:49,000
Okay, so anyway, Twitch has kind of repurposed

2064
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:50,000
his channel a little bit.

2065
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:53,000
I mean, it's, look, Twitch got a lot of clicks.

2066
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:55,000
It makes sense, I think, for, sorry,

2067
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:56,000
Ninja got Twitch a lot of clicks.

2068
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:58,000
It makes sense for Twitch to kind of repurpose

2069
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:00,000
his channel a little bit for the people

2070
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:01,000
that might end up there or be curious.

2071
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:04,000
And so they changed it with a message that says,

2072
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:06,000
the Ninja you're looking for is in another castle, right?

2073
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:08,000
I'll throw back to Mario.

2074
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:09,000
TEEHEE.

2075
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:11,000
Check out these other popular live channels

2076
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:13,000
and then of course it shows, you know,

2077
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:15,000
other people playing Fortnite and so forth.

2078
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:17,000
And some of the other big streamers

2079
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:19,000
that do Fortnite is out there.

2080
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:22,000
So that is what Twitch did.

2081
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:24,000
But apparently there's a part two to this, right, Loki?

2082
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:28,000
Yes, the part two is apparently that now on Twitch

2083
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:30,000
it is showing the top Fortnite streamers

2084
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:32,000
on his channel instead.

2085
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:36,000
And what do you think was the top Fortnite streamer recently?

2086
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:39,000
Why, it was people fucking on camera.

2087
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:41,000
That's right, people fucking on Twitch,

2088
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:44,000
right on camera for everybody to see.

2089
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:46,000
That's the new Fortnite and guess which video

2090
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:50,000
was number one on that channel for Ninja.

2091
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:53,000
That's right, it's people fucking the game.

2092
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:57,000
And of course he was not happy about that.

2093
01:43:57,000 --> 01:44:01,000
He says this is disgusted and I'm so sorry.

2094
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:03,000
Oh, give me a break.

2095
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:05,000
That's what he said, did he put out a comment

2096
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:07,000
as to how disgusted he is about this?

2097
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:11,000
Yeah, Ninja did, because it's not his channel anymore.

2098
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:14,000
Okay, like look, ha ha, somebody got

2099
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:16,000
porned out on Twitch.

2100
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:18,000
I'm sure Twitch shut that down ASAP.

2101
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:22,000
But don't fucking fame like, oh my God,

2102
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:25,000
really, in front of my salad?

2103
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:27,000
Really?

2104
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:34,000
Somebody game the system, I'm sure it got shut down.

2105
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:37,000
Somebody got a screen grab in the 30 seconds it was up.

2106
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:39,000
His channel now, he says Twitch has now reverted

2107
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:42,000
my channel back to how an offline page should look.

2108
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:44,000
Thank you.

2109
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:46,000
So they've shut everything down now.

2110
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:48,000
Oh my God.

2111
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:52,000
But seriously, it's just, it's ridiculous.

2112
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:54,000
And I saw a screenshot and I was like...

2113
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:56,000
Run Jump Stomp said Twitch left it running for over two hours.

2114
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:58,000
Was it like on the weekend or something?

2115
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:00,000
How did it go for so long?

2116
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:02,000
I don't know, but like, come on Twitch dude.

2117
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:04,000
Well, I mean...

2118
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:06,000
Okay, we all know that the Fortnite

2119
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:08,000
top recommended stream thing is probably

2120
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:10,000
automated, right? We've already

2121
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:12,000
talked about what people read into those thumbnails

2122
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:14,000
and so forth. Do you think

2123
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:16,000
that these people fucking

2124
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:18,000
or whatever, do you think that is the world's

2125
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:20,000
first people

2126
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:22,000
on Twitch having sex?

2127
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:24,000
No, of course not, because we had playroom.

2128
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:26,000
I was just about to say,

2129
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:28,000
I was just about to say the fucking playroom

2130
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:30,000
on PlayStation 4. Like, oh my God,

2131
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:32,000
like, if I could go back,

2132
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:34,000
if I could go back to a time in

2133
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:36,000
gaming history, I would

2134
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:38,000
not go back to the NES or the

2135
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:40,000
Atari 2600. I would not go back to those days.

2136
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:42,000
Because, look, I have a lot of love

2137
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:44,000
in my heart for the Commodore 64 in all those

2138
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:46,000
days. I love those days. But here's

2139
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:48,000
where, you know what I'd go back to?

2140
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:50,000
I would go back to when the PlayStation 4 was brand

2141
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:52,000
new and people were streaming the most

2142
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:54,000
wild shit on the playroom.

2143
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:56,000
Because...

2144
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:58,000
Because what is better

2145
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:00,000
than having sex on stream,

2146
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:02,000
having sex on stream while

2147
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:04,000
augmented reality

2148
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:06,000
robots stare at you and go, what the

2149
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:08,000
fuck is going on? Like, what are they

2150
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:10,000
doing?

2151
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:12,000
They start walking on your back and shit.

2152
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:16,000
Kaijuno says,

2153
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:18,000
nah, before playroom we had poker on the

2154
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:20,000
PlayStation 2 and itoy TV.

2155
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:22,000
I forgot, yo.

2156
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:24,000
People could do that on the Xbox 360

2157
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:26,000
with Uno. I remember that was the thing.

2158
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:28,000
I'll show you Draw4.

2159
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:30,000
Yes, I remember when we used

2160
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:32,000
the itoy for streaming our

2161
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:34,000
channel.

2162
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:36,000
Did we use an itoy camera to broadcast

2163
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:38,000
like the 30 second update

2164
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:40,000
clips? Yes, we used to do

2165
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:42,000
that because, and then we also, we

2166
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:44,000
streamed playing that stupid washing

2167
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:46,000
windows game that they had on there.

2168
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:48,000
Remember that? Itoy play.

2169
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:50,000
Yeah, itoy play. Remember that dumb little song

2170
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:52,000
where now I'm washing windows.

2171
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:54,000
Yes.

2172
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:56,000
Yes.

2173
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:58,000
We used to do that.

2174
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:00,000
Why is it so funny? I don't know.

2175
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:02,000
It was stupid, but it worked.

2176
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:04,000
I just want to

2177
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:06,000
come out with a very serious note here, and this isn't

2178
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:08,000
funny. We shouldn't laugh at this when it comes to porn,

2179
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:10,000
but it's worth talking about.

2180
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:12,000
YouTube has a huge problem of people

2181
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:14,000
trying to get porn on YouTube kids.

2182
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:16,000
That's gross. Very sick people

2183
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:18,000
try to do this. I see this as the same thing.

2184
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:20,000
And you know, bringing us back to Earth

2185
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:22,000
a little bit here. Yeah, I mean there's a lot of kids

2186
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:24,000
that look for Fortnite type of streams too.

2187
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:26,000
So even though we might be having, you know,

2188
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:28,000
a laugh at the people doing porn, if kids

2189
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:30,000
find it, it isn't really that funny. Although

2190
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:32,000
parents should be watching what their kids are

2191
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:34,000
clicking on. And also, they don't have a Twitch

2192
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:36,000
Kids or anything like that, and I would see a lot

2193
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:38,000
of streamers out there probably language wise

2194
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:40,000
wouldn't necessarily be, you know,

2195
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:42,000
friendly for kids, so. Fair.

2196
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:44,000
I would be, I wouldn't

2197
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:46,000
let my kids go on Twitch probably.

2198
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:48,000
Yeah, like unsupervised for sure.

2199
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:50,000
I mean, the crap that my son watches

2200
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:52,000
most of the time, like

2201
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:54,000
I swear to God, it's

2202
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:56,000
fucking Roblox and the guys

2203
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:58,000
talking about gold diggers all the fucking

2204
01:47:58,000 --> 01:48:00,000
time and how there's like women

2205
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:02,000
on there that are trying to get Robux

2206
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:04,000
or, I don't know what the fuck these people

2207
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:06,000
are talking about, but like, why are you

2208
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:08,000
talking about gold diggers? You don't fucking know anything

2209
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:10,000
about what you're talking about.

2210
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:12,000
Now Questbuster says that's probably why Ninja was

2211
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:14,000
really upset. He knows his audience and having that

2212
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:16,000
on his former channel on Twitch was not

2213
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:18,000
a good look. Right, because

2214
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:20,000
a lot of people might not know that he moved to

2215
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:22,000
Mixer, and they're like, well, why is Ninja

2216
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:24,000
streaming porn on his channel?

2217
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:26,000
Even though it's not, it's like a

2218
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:28,000
recommend feed for somebody else, but like

2219
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:30,000
you know, people don't read into anything.

2220
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:32,000
Why couldn't he just be a little more shady about it?

2221
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:34,000
Why couldn't he just be like, well, now you know why I left Twitch.

2222
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:36,000
Like, why couldn't he just be shady?

2223
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:38,000
You know, seriously though,

2224
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:40,000
that is a conversation that a lot

2225
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:42,000
of people are having right now about

2226
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:44,000
the unfair

2227
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:46,000
treatment between, like, some people

2228
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:48,000
on the platform are getting better treatment than other

2229
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:50,000
people on the platform, and

2230
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:52,000
for some reason recently, like, people

2231
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:54,000
just abusing their pets.

2232
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:56,000
I don't know why this is a trend.

2233
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:58,000
Oh, can we not? Because like, oh my

2234
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:00,000
god, like, I get more upset about

2235
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:02,000
like the girl that threw the cat on the floor

2236
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:04,000
and all this. I get more upset about that than like

2237
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:06,000
people. Oh no, it's not

2238
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:08,000
even, it's not even that, but like, there's

2239
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:10,000
another one, it was

2240
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:12,000
they put their dog in a dryer

2241
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:14,000
and turned it on. No, I don't want to hear it.

2242
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:16,000
It's gross, disgusting. But yeah, I don't know

2243
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:18,000
what's wrong with people. People are

2244
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:20,000
fucked up, and they shouldn't be streaming that shit.

2245
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:22,000
No, absolutely not. Gross.

2246
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:24,000
Oh my god, like, there's a special

2247
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:26,000
place for you in hell when that all

2248
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:28,000
oh, I've just discussed it. Why would people

2249
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:30,000
Can we move on please? Yes, move on.

2250
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:32,000
Yes, please. And honestly, sadly

2251
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:34,000
this is not a great story to move on to,

2252
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:36,000
but it's just the way the story has landed this week, so

2253
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:38,000
Yes, it is. Let's get more upset.

2254
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:40,000
So let's talk about how people are being

2255
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:42,000
man babies again, so

2256
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:44,000
you know,

2257
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:46,000
apparently Twitch

2258
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:48,000
employees are getting threats

2259
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:50,000
and now the

2260
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:52,000
police are involved, so

2261
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:54,000
apparently they've been having

2262
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:56,000
there's been a serious threat made against

2263
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:58,000
our San Francisco HQ on Tuesday

2264
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:00,000
and have been working directly with law

2265
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:02,000
enforcement as they investigate.

2266
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:04,000
The safety and security of our employees

2267
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:06,000
is top priority, and we are focused

2268
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:08,000
on ensuring this is resolved quickly

2269
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:10,000
and safely, and to help

2270
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:12,000
with that, they're having employees actually

2271
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:14,000
work from home.

2272
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:16,000
They didn't say exactly what

2273
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:18,000
the

2274
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:20,000
threat was, which is probably fine

2275
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:22,000
because they don't want copycats, but

2276
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:24,000
that, you know, the fact that you're

2277
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:26,000
there's an active threat against a platform

2278
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:28,000
or a company, and like, you know,

2279
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:30,000
I'm assuming too, the serious threat, like, we're gonna

2280
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:32,000
come in and shoot up your building or something like that.

2281
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:34,000
You gotta take that so seriously. I mean, like,

2282
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:36,000
not even a few months ago

2283
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:38,000
this happened in YouTube.

2284
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:40,000
Of course, you don't, you don't say, like,

2285
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:42,000
what is the number one thing

2286
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:44,000
that, like, in the biggest font when you're going through the

2287
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:46,000
TSA at the airport, don't even

2288
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:48,000
joke, right? Like, that's like,

2289
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:50,000
like, don't, don't even joke because it

2290
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:52,000
ain't funny, you know, and it's the

2291
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:54,000
same thing with these

2292
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:56,000
threats people are calling into

2293
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:58,000
Twitch and all this stuff.

2294
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:00,000
You know, it's not funny. Yeah.

2295
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:02,000
It's very serious in this, especially in this world

2296
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:04,000
that we live in. It's gross.

2297
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:06,000
This is why we need to bring back

2298
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:08,000
spanking. They need to find

2299
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:10,000
this person and they need to spank them.

2300
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:12,000
Like, it's just, it's

2301
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:14,000
like the little child that they are with

2302
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:16,000
this little,

2303
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:18,000
it's just disgusting. Yeah. I think it's so

2304
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:20,000
gross. All right.

2305
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:22,000
Anyhow, I hope they find

2306
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:24,000
the person and my hearts go out

2307
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:26,000
to the Twitch people that were probably, honestly, with

2308
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:28,000
everything else going on in the world, we're probably

2309
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:30,000
shook by this, you know, like,

2310
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:34,000
I got nothing else to say.

2311
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:36,000
Let's move on.

2312
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:38,000
Let's do, can we do something lighthearted, please?

2313
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:40,000
How about a rumor? How about a good old

2314
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:42,000
gaming rumor? All right. Good.

2315
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:44,000
When we need to, when we need to lighten

2316
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:46,000
the tone a little bit, let's do, either we get Mr. Smoosh

2317
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:48,000
on camera, but that's his choice, or

2318
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:50,000
we talk about gaming rumors. So,

2319
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:52,000
let's talk about a

2320
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:54,000
patent that was filed by Microsoft recently

2321
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:56,000
to turn your smartphone

2322
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:58,000
into a gaming device.

2323
01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:00,000
Huh. That's kind of interesting.

2324
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:02,000
So, there was a patent that was put in last month,

2325
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:04,000
and it's actually

2326
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:06,000
detailing a charging device

2327
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:08,000
for removable input modules.

2328
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:10,000
So, the patent isn't for this controller,

2329
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:12,000
but you can kind of see this controller in the mock-ups.

2330
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:14,000
So, basically, imagine

2331
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:16,000
I were to take my cell phone,

2332
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:18,000
okay, and I would actually plug in,

2333
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:20,000
think like Switch-style joy-cons

2334
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:22,000
on the left side and the right side,

2335
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:24,000
but something that a little bit more resembled

2336
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:26,000
a Xbox One

2337
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:28,000
gamepad. That's kind of what

2338
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:30,000
it looks like for those of you that haven't seen the visuals

2339
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:32,000
yet. And there would be, of course,

2340
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:34,000
a number of color options in this patent,

2341
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:36,000
two halves of a controller,

2342
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:38,000
it clips around your smartphone.

2343
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:40,000
So, you know, and again, companies

2344
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:42,000
file patents all the time that they don't even use,

2345
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:44,000
so it may mean nothing, but

2346
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:46,000
what do we know?

2347
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:48,000
Microsoft's going to be making a big push into

2348
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:50,000
cloud streaming and all that stuff, right?

2349
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:52,000
Microsoft doesn't exactly have the Windows phone

2350
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:54,000
stuff, really, like they used to have,

2351
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:56,000
so it makes sense for them to partner up with Android

2352
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:58,000
and iOS,

2353
01:52:58,000 --> 01:53:00,000
which Apple has

2354
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:02,000
really been, Google to some extent, too, has really

2355
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:04,000
been lacking some type of official gaming

2356
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:06,000
controller that could really make

2357
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:08,000
things more playable on those

2358
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:10,000
screens, right, because everything on those

2359
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:12,000
systems is touch, which is fine

2360
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:14,000
when the games are designed for touch,

2361
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:16,000
like Pokemon Go or something,

2362
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:18,000
but Xbox 360 and

2363
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:20,000
Xbox One games are not designed for touch,

2364
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:22,000
so it makes sense that you would have this little controller

2365
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:24,000
or whatever, but I gotta

2366
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:26,000
say, if this ends up being true,

2367
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:28,000
what a clever little idea on

2368
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:30,000
Microsoft's part to basically,

2369
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:32,000
because it's going to be a lot cheaper than selling you

2370
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:34,000
something like a PlayStation Vita. This is not

2371
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:36,000
a PlayStation Vita, this is almost

2372
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:38,000
certainly something that's going to tie

2373
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:40,000
into xCloud and

2374
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:42,000
Microsoft's streaming services

2375
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:44,000
to allow you to play Xbox One

2376
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:46,000
games and others like that.

2377
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:48,000
Not even that, or just streaming from your

2378
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:50,000
console, well yeah, I remember that xCloud was

2379
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:52,000
also the streaming from console, kind of like

2380
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:54,000
how they did with the remote play stuff, but

2381
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:56,000
you know, something similar,

2382
01:53:56,000 --> 01:53:58,000
sounds like.

2383
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:00,000
Yeah, so anyway,

2384
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:02,000
and it should be noted that some of

2385
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:04,000
the designs we're seeing out there are mockups

2386
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:06,000
and so forth, they are not,

2387
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:08,000
they're based on the patents, but they're not necessarily

2388
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:10,000
from the patents, so please be careful

2389
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:12,000
with what you see out there.

2390
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:14,000
However, it is very,

2391
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:16,000
sorry, I have coughs,

2392
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:18,000
it is very interesting that Microsoft

2393
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:20,000
is looking at doing this, it makes a lot of sense

2394
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:22,000
for what could their direction be

2395
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:24,000
when it comes to the cloud and all this,

2396
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:26,000
you know, and how they're going to

2397
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:28,000
solve the issue of gaming on the go,

2398
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:30,000
but not necessarily like, you know,

2399
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:32,000
on your

2400
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:34,000
phone, but with your phone. Yeah, it's not like

2401
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:36,000
a dedicated device, it's just

2402
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:38,000
you know, its own

2403
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:40,000
thing that can attach to tablets. So

2404
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:42,000
SJ100Matt points out that Asus has a phone that's

2405
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:44,000
almost like this, it's a gaming cell phone, it's

2406
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:46,000
called the Asus ROG.

2407
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:48,000
You know, and he says

2408
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:50,000
it's pretty amazing, and I bet it is pretty amazing, but

2409
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:52,000
still, also interesting

2410
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:54,000
in a way, I think, that you know, if you get

2411
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:56,000
Microsoft and something of that caliber

2412
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:58,000
behind this, and Microsoft says, this

2413
01:54:58,000 --> 01:55:00,000
is the solution we are endorsing, so you can

2414
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:02,000
play Halo, you can play

2415
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:04,000
Sea of Thieves, you can play whatever

2416
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:06,000
on Project

2417
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:08,000
Scorpio and all this stuff, you know,

2418
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:10,000
if they like roll this out at the same time, this could be very,

2419
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:12,000
very big. And it's an

2420
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:14,000
interesting way to kind of address

2421
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:16,000
the Switch thing, like

2422
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:18,000
playing it on your, but without

2423
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:20,000
necessarily putting out a clone of the Switch.

2424
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:22,000
Well, and eventually, when we get 5G

2425
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:24,000
rolled out everywhere, and then you have

2426
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:26,000
unlimited plans and stuff like that,

2427
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:28,000
then it makes this type of gaming

2428
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:30,000
feasible on the go.

2429
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:32,000
Now, Dr. Tetsuya said earlier

2430
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:34,000
in our chat, saying, I have to wonder if

2431
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:36,000
Tommy Tallarico has heard about this, it sort of

2432
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:38,000
sounds up the alley from what

2433
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:40,000
he was looking into for extra Amico

2434
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:42,000
controllers, that comment from our

2435
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:44,000
Twitch channel at twitch.tv slash vognetwork

2436
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:46,000
as we tape live here on Sunday night.

2437
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:48,000
But, yeah.

2438
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:50,000
Aren't we getting something Amico-related from

2439
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:52,000
Gamescom as well?

2440
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:54,000
Well, we know they were kind of at

2441
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:56,000
E3, but we didn't get a lot out of that, besides

2442
01:55:56,000 --> 01:55:58,000
some of the console designs, which look pretty

2443
01:55:58,000 --> 01:56:00,000
hot, but I don't know if we know much about

2444
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:02,000
the games yet, maybe we'll get some of that out of

2445
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:04,000
Gamescom, but I still feel like Intellivision's a big

2446
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:06,000
question mark on a lot of things, but

2447
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:08,000
they're not out until, what was their day,

2448
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:10,000
10-10-2020 or something like that was their big day.

2449
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:12,000
So, they've still got over a year to go,

2450
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:14,000
so I imagine we're not going to start seeing all the games

2451
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:16,000
just yet, so. Oh!

2452
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:18,000
Okay, Bobby's there to

2453
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:20,000
correct me, as usual, saying

2454
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:22,000
yes, the new trailer comes out at

2455
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:24,000
Gamescom with 14 games

2456
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:26,000
and the hardware, so apparently, I guess there was

2457
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:28,000
an announcement, I didn't see it. So,

2458
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:30,000
hmm, pretty cool.

2459
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:32,000
Yeah. Yeah. Anyway.

2460
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:34,000
Alright, so maybe

2461
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:36,000
that's something that'll show up. Well, I didn't see

2462
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:38,000
Intellivision on the list of who was showing up to

2463
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:40,000
Jeff Keighley's thing, but I guess they probably want to do their own thing

2464
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:42,000
if this is like the big reveal of the games.

2465
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:44,000
So curious what kind of games they got.

2466
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:46,000
So curious. I want to know if YYR

2467
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:48,000
got in or not, because you know if he did,

2468
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:50,000
he's not going to be able to talk about it even on this show.

2469
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:52,000
So, I'm just crossing my fingers on my toes

2470
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:54,000
for him, so. Alright, Bobby says

2471
01:56:54,000 --> 01:56:56,000
it was supposed to be August 1st, but they delayed it

2472
01:56:56,000 --> 01:56:58,000
to Gamescom. Well, that makes sense, you know.

2473
01:56:58,000 --> 01:57:00,000
Why not? Why not kick it off with a

2474
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:02,000
big gaming show and show all of that?

2475
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:04,000
Alright, we are almost

2476
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:06,000
to your calls, if anybody wants to

2477
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:08,000
call in tonight at our Discord server, vognetwork.com,

2478
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:10,000
vognetwork.com slash

2479
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:12,000
Discord, but we have a couple more stories

2480
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:14,000
for you guys first, and Loki's about to

2481
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:16,000
make me very upset. Yes,

2482
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:18,000
isn't it so lovely how we talked

2483
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:20,000
last week about how the 2019

2484
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:22,000
E3

2485
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:24,000
attendees, you know, they went there and had

2486
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:26,000
all their information leaked and were like, see, this is

2487
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:28,000
why we don't go to E3. This doesn't

2488
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:30,000
affect us at all. And then they sent us a

2489
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:32,000
fucking email saying, hey, guess what? Hey,

2490
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:34,000
you went to E3 in 2006 or

2491
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:36,000
2004, we leaked your shit too.

2492
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:38,000
And wasn't I

2493
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:40,000
like sitting here going, thank God we haven't been

2494
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:42,000
in years and our stuff probably

2495
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:44,000
and God damn it. Although,

2496
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:46,000
I certainly wasn't

2497
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:48,000
media in 2004. I was

2498
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:50,000
a, we all went as guests of a

2499
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:52,000
major gaming company, which if you think back

2500
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:54,000
to what this show used to talk about

2501
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:56,000
that many years ago, almost exclusively,

2502
01:57:56,000 --> 01:57:58,000
you can probably put two and two together

2503
01:57:58,000 --> 01:58:00,000
and figure out what gaming company

2504
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:02,000
invited us, but that's neither here nor there.

2505
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:04,000
2006, but 2006, I don't think

2506
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:06,000
we went as media or did you get an email?

2507
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:08,000
I got an email. Oh no,

2508
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:10,000
I didn't get an email about that.

2509
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:12,000
Oh my

2510
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:14,000
God, I'm so mad. I don't remember. I thought

2511
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:16,000
we went as just general attendees and registered

2512
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:18,000
with the general public in 2005.

2513
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:20,000
No, we went as media.

2514
01:58:20,000 --> 01:58:22,000
I mean, I

2515
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:24,000
have to check. I've got my badges in the garage,

2516
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:26,000
but yeah, no,

2517
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:28,000
I'm just now I'm finding this out for the first time. I thought

2518
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:30,000
we went as general. I didn't think we went as media until

2519
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:32,000
the All Games years. Well, that was 2006.

2520
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:34,000
After, no,

2521
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:36,000
we weren't with All Games in 2006.

2522
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:38,000
Were we? That was the

2523
01:58:38,000 --> 01:58:40,000
2006 one because that's, that

2524
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:42,000
was Ridge Racer year.

2525
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:44,000
2006. I thought

2526
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:46,000
that came way later. No, that was the

2527
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:48,000
year that they did the PS3 announcement.

2528
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:50,000
Oh crap. Because

2529
01:58:50,000 --> 01:58:52,000
Oh, that's right.

2530
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:54,000
Bobby says 2006 was the Arena

2531
01:58:54,000 --> 01:58:56,000
Interactive Lounge year. Fuck,

2532
01:58:56,000 --> 01:58:58,000
that's right. We were

2533
01:58:58,000 --> 01:59:00,000
media that year.

2534
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:02,000
Oh no.

2535
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:04,000
No, I'm fucking mad now.

2536
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:06,000
I'm, well, my mailing

2537
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:08,000
address is my old company that's closed down.

2538
01:59:08,000 --> 01:59:10,000
Yeah, all my information

2539
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:12,000
is like dirt old. Like,

2540
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:14,000
was I living with you in 2006?

2541
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:16,000
Uh, yeah. Yeah, so like,

2542
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:18,000
all that information is like dirt old by now.

2543
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:20,000
It's not like it's my current address or anything, but it's still,

2544
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:22,000
and I haven't gotten any like creepy, I think my phone

2545
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:24,000
number might have been different too.

2546
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:26,000
Oh yeah, because I probably registered with a home number

2547
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:28,000
which I don't even have anymore, because we had a

2548
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:30,000
home phone at that time, so yeah, that was probably

2549
01:59:30,000 --> 01:59:32,000
our business phone.

2550
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:34,000
I want to say one year we like changed

2551
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:36,000
the message to say something like, you're

2552
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:38,000
calling OLR Studio. I feel

2553
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:40,000
like that was the year we did all that.

2554
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:42,000
So yeah, the good news

2555
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:44,000
is that all the information is going to be shit anyway.

2556
01:59:44,000 --> 01:59:46,000
But it's still, it's

2557
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:48,000
infuriating. So here's how they, it actually

2558
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:50,000
leaked out. So it wasn't like someone hacked the

2559
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:52,000
site and found anything. It was actually archived

2560
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:54,000
by the internet archive.

2561
01:59:54,000 --> 01:59:56,000
And it was just floating around out there

2562
01:59:56,000 --> 01:59:58,000
for someone to access. If they access

2563
01:59:58,000 --> 02:00:00,000
the archive page, they can get the full list of

2564
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:02,000
attendees from 2004 to 2006.

2565
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:04,000
How nice.

2566
02:00:04,000 --> 02:00:06,000
Jason in chat says, old information is still

2567
02:00:06,000 --> 02:00:08,000
relevant for credit reports and

2568
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:10,000
identity verifications, so, and

2569
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:12,000
says sorry. No, I mean, you're just being a realist.

2570
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:14,000
But that's like four or five addresses

2571
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:16,000
ago, so. It was a long time ago, but

2572
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:18,000
I mean, I'm not saying, oh it's

2573
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:20,000
okay, I don't care, because the information

2574
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:22,000
is so old. No, I'm

2575
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:24,000
fucking pissed off about it, and the

2576
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:26,000
ESA fucking sucks for what they did.

2577
02:00:26,000 --> 02:00:28,000
And, you know, fucking, I

2578
02:00:28,000 --> 02:00:30,000
hope there's a class action lawsuit and shit

2579
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:32,000
because this is inexcusable what they

2580
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:34,000
did. Like, please understand

2581
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:36,000
me very fucking explicitly on this. I'm

2582
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:38,000
not happy that this happened.

2583
02:00:38,000 --> 02:00:40,000
I'm really not happy. So here's

2584
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:42,000
the statement that they put out in email. So it says

2585
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:44,000
I don't, I kind of don't give a fuck, like

2586
02:00:44,000 --> 02:00:46,000
what they had to say, because it's, it's all it is

2587
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:48,000
going to be talk. Less talk,

2588
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:50,000
more action. Yeah, they're just blaming

2589
02:00:50,000 --> 02:00:52,000
their, well the files weren't hosted on the

2590
02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:54,000
servers or on the current website. We took

2591
02:00:54,000 --> 02:00:56,000
immediate action to remove those files.

2592
02:00:56,000 --> 02:00:58,000
They were cached on third party Internet Archive

2593
02:00:58,000 --> 02:01:00,000
site. We're working with our partners and

2594
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:02,000
outside counsel, independent experts to investigate

2595
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:04,000
what led to this situation to enhance

2596
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:06,000
our security efforts.

2597
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:08,000
So,

2598
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:10,000
you know, what can

2599
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:12,000
they do? I don't know, put any

2600
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:14,000
security on there because there was literally none.

2601
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:16,000
So, that's a start.

2602
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:18,000
But, yeah.

2603
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:20,000
So that was it, because I saw that

2604
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:22,000
in my email. I'm like, uh,

2605
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:24,000
why am I getting this?

2606
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:26,000
So fucking mad. PixelPockets

2607
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:28,000
in chat says ESA statements on this are

2608
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:30,000
so eye rolling. They are at fault.

2609
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:32,000
If the files were archived, they were

2610
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:34,000
up on the site at some point because they put

2611
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:36,000
them there. Sounds, and Bob Coffee says

2612
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:38,000
sounds like PR bullshit. It is.

2613
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:40,000
Nifty805

2614
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:42,000
says Rob is ready to out rant Loki tonight.

2615
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:44,000
I'm, yeah, I'm pissed about

2616
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:46,000
this. This is way, this is way more

2617
02:01:46,000 --> 02:01:48,000
serious than, like, Nintendo not getting

2618
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:50,000
online or whatever shit Loki rants about

2619
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:52,000
in a week. Sorry, Loki. But this

2620
02:01:52,000 --> 02:01:54,000
is, like, this is far more important than

2621
02:01:54,000 --> 02:01:56,000
any of that. And it's, it's just,

2622
02:01:56,000 --> 02:01:58,000
it's so infuriating because, again, the ESA's

2623
02:01:58,000 --> 02:02:00,000
not really talking action. They're just

2624
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:02,000
talking about, like, it's not our fault.

2625
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:04,000
Like, it was, and it's just, like,

2626
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:06,000
fucking accountability, bitch.

2627
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:08,000
Like,

2628
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:10,000
I'm so mad.

2629
02:02:10,000 --> 02:02:12,000
But what can you do? What can

2630
02:02:12,000 --> 02:02:14,000
you do? Like, you feel helpless about the whole

2631
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:16,000
thing. It's like if this, the company's not leaking

2632
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:18,000
your information, it's somebody else leaking

2633
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:20,000
your credit information or whatever. It's, like,

2634
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:22,000
why do we have credit

2635
02:02:22,000 --> 02:02:24,000
information anymore? It's just, it's all public

2636
02:02:24,000 --> 02:02:26,000
anyway, apparently. Yeah. So

2637
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:28,000
ridiculous.

2638
02:02:28,000 --> 02:02:30,000
QuestBuster

2639
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:32,000
and chat. ESA. So, we need to

2640
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:34,000
spend money to secure this stuff. Just hide it in a

2641
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:36,000
folder or something. Barf.

2642
02:02:36,000 --> 02:02:38,000
But I get it. It's

2643
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:40,000
negligence. Absolutely. That's what I'm saying.

2644
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:42,000
You're a fucking tech company. You

2645
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:44,000
represent the tech industry.

2646
02:02:44,000 --> 02:02:46,000
Not a good look when you're supposed to be representing

2647
02:02:46,000 --> 02:02:48,000
the tech industry.

2648
02:02:48,000 --> 02:02:50,000
Anyway.

2649
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:52,000
Let's move on to something a little more.

2650
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:54,000
Let me find my happy place by listening

2651
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:56,000
to some music. Okay?

2652
02:02:56,000 --> 02:02:58,000
So, let's talk a little bit about the Mana

2653
02:02:58,000 --> 02:03:00,000
series and, uh, the Mana

2654
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:02,000
soundtracks, meaning, like, secret

2655
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:04,000
of Mana or trials of Mana as

2656
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:06,000
it is now. Square Enix has just

2657
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:08,000
put 13 soundtracks

2658
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:10,000
for the second Densetsu or

2659
02:03:10,000 --> 02:03:12,000
Mana series on several different

2660
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:14,000
platforms including Apple Music,

2661
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:16,000
Spotify, Amazon Music

2662
02:03:16,000 --> 02:03:18,000
and many more. Some of the

2663
02:03:18,000 --> 02:03:20,000
soundtracks that are out now. Second Densetsu

2664
02:03:20,000 --> 02:03:22,000
2, meaning Secret of Mana, the original

2665
02:03:22,000 --> 02:03:24,000
soundtrack. Second Densetsu 3

2666
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:26,000
original soundtrack. Legend of Mana

2667
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:28,000
original soundtrack. Heroes of Mana.

2668
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:30,000
Rise of Mana. DS Children's of Mana.

2669
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:32,000
I mean, just pretty much all the

2670
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:34,000
second Densetsu and related Mana games you can think

2671
02:03:34,000 --> 02:03:36,000
of. All of those soundtracks going up on

2672
02:03:36,000 --> 02:03:38,000
Spotify and, uh, some great,

2673
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:40,000
some great music, some great tunes.

2674
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:42,000
So, um, a lot happier

2675
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:44,000
of a note to end on tonight.

2676
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:46,000
Well, I've got even better, uh, better

2677
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:48,000
note to end on tonight. Oh, you got some last minute news,

2678
02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:50,000
do you? Yes. Well, good. I'll start bringing up Discord

2679
02:03:50,000 --> 02:03:52,000
to see if anybody wants to call in tonight while you get into that.

2680
02:03:52,000 --> 02:03:54,000
So, guess what game is getting a reboot?

2681
02:03:54,000 --> 02:03:56,000
A reboot. A reboot.

2682
02:03:56,000 --> 02:03:58,000
Okay, what? Cooking Mama.

2683
02:03:58,000 --> 02:04:00,000
Oh, that's kind of fun.

2684
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:02,000
So, Cooking Mama's gonna be coming back to the

2685
02:04:02,000 --> 02:04:04,000
Nintendo Switch. That's what I

2686
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:06,000
can tell the ESA. Don't worry.

2687
02:04:06,000 --> 02:04:08,000
Mama will fix it. Thanks to

2688
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:10,000
Planet Digital Partners.

2689
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:12,000
As part of this, they're gonna have a brand new

2690
02:04:12,000 --> 02:04:14,000
mode to go along with the regular recipes.

2691
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:16,000
It's basically a vegetarian

2692
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:18,000
mode. So, for people that don't want to

2693
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:20,000
cook anything that has meat ingredients,

2694
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:22,000
you won't have to. You can just switch to the

2695
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:24,000
vegetarian mode and cook all

2696
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:26,000
the vegetarian recipes. That's cute.

2697
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:28,000
Yeah. For those that that's important

2698
02:04:28,000 --> 02:04:30,000
to them, that's cute. It's an easy

2699
02:04:30,000 --> 02:04:32,000
change to make, I suppose. Yep.

2700
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:34,000
Yeah. So, that's it. No

2701
02:04:34,000 --> 02:04:36,000
word on when it's coming out yet, but

2702
02:04:36,000 --> 02:04:38,000
pretty

2703
02:04:38,000 --> 02:04:40,000
cool. I hope I say this name

2704
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:42,000
right. I'm sorry if I mispronounced it.

2705
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:44,000
Oh, in the fall. Oh, that's really

2706
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:46,000
soon. Yeah. Sorry if I mispronounced this name.

2707
02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:48,000
Thower66. I'm sorry if I, or maybe

2708
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:50,000
it's just Thor, but spelled differently.

2709
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:52,000
I'm gonna say Thor. Thor66

2710
02:04:52,000 --> 02:04:54,000
in chat says, Dark Sakura should be happy.

2711
02:04:54,000 --> 02:04:56,000
I agreed. I'll have to let her know about

2712
02:04:56,000 --> 02:04:58,000
it. And by the way, I believe Thor66

2713
02:04:58,000 --> 02:05:00,000
in chat mentioned

2714
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:02,000
that they've been listening since the All Games

2715
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:04,000
days and, or, and even before that

2716
02:05:04,000 --> 02:05:06,000
on Life 365 and I guess just

2717
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:08,000
rediscovered us here on Twitch. Yep. We're

2718
02:05:08,000 --> 02:05:10,000
still here. We're still here. A little older.

2719
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:12,000
I got more gray, but we're here

2720
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:14,000
and doing this video thing now that we've been doing

2721
02:05:14,000 --> 02:05:16,000
since December. So, um, yeah, it's

2722
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:18,000
a whole new world out there with video, but

2723
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:20,000
17 years, if you can believe it.

2724
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:22,000
It's a long time.

2725
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:24,000
Yeah. Almost as old as that ESA information

2726
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:26,000
that's leaked out almost

2727
02:05:26,000 --> 02:05:28,000
past week. Jesus Christ.

2728
02:05:28,000 --> 02:05:30,000
All right. PixelPaca says, what about vegan

2729
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:32,000
mama? Baby steps. Baby steps.

2730
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:34,000
They're gonna have Beyond Meat in there.

2731
02:05:34,000 --> 02:05:36,000
Oh, maybe that's the hot new thing. I haven't tried

2732
02:05:36,000 --> 02:05:38,000
that yet. The Beyond Meat. Yeah.

2733
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:40,000
That's beyond what I'm gonna try.

2734
02:05:40,000 --> 02:05:42,000
I hear it's pretty good. No. I'll try

2735
02:05:42,000 --> 02:05:44,000
it. What if it tastes like meat?

2736
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:46,000
No. I'm curious. I'm curious.

2737
02:05:46,000 --> 02:05:48,000
But I heard, like, they're getting some crap.

2738
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:50,000
It's a slippery slope. Like Burger King is

2739
02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:52,000
kind of getting crap because they cook it on the same grill that they

2740
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:54,000
cook the meat on. So it's kind of

2741
02:05:54,000 --> 02:05:56,000
kind of defeats the purpose. Oh.

2742
02:05:56,000 --> 02:05:58,000
Oh, yeah. Yes.

2743
02:05:58,000 --> 02:06:00,000
That I get that. I thought

2744
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:02,000
I was like, what, is it going to make the burgers taste bad or something?

2745
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:04,000
Like, I don't understand the point is like, oh,

2746
02:06:04,000 --> 02:06:06,000
yeah. If you're vegan, if you're vegetarian

2747
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:08,000
for, like, health reasons, what's that like?

2748
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:10,000
That was like when McDonald's used to, like,

2749
02:06:10,000 --> 02:06:12,000
uh, fry their stuff in, like,

2750
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:14,000
beef fat or something like that. They used to

2751
02:06:14,000 --> 02:06:16,000
have, like, some sort of, like, meat fat in there as

2752
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:18,000
well. Yeah. Lard or something. I don't know.

2753
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:20,000
Yeah. But their fries taste better then. I don't

2754
02:06:20,000 --> 02:06:22,000
know. Uh, Jason in our chat says

2755
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:24,000
it doesn't taste like meat. It bleeds like meat.

2756
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:26,000
Yeah, I heard that was a thing, too.

2757
02:06:26,000 --> 02:06:28,000
That it, like, actually will, like,

2758
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:30,000
bleed. I guess, I don't know what, if it's beets

2759
02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:32,000
or something that it's using to make it look like

2760
02:06:32,000 --> 02:06:34,000
it's bleeding. Yeah. Gross, right?

2761
02:06:34,000 --> 02:06:36,000
But that's, yeah. Anyway.

2762
02:06:36,000 --> 02:06:38,000
Alright, let's move on.

2763
02:06:38,000 --> 02:06:40,000
Let's take some calls. We actually have somebody

2764
02:06:40,000 --> 02:06:42,000
in the green room over on our Discord

2765
02:06:42,000 --> 02:06:44,000
server, so let's get to a call tonight.

2766
02:06:44,000 --> 02:06:46,000
Hi, you are on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?

2767
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:50,000
Hey, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2768
02:06:50,000 --> 02:06:52,000
If you can hear me, we can't hear you. Hello.

2769
02:06:52,000 --> 02:06:54,000
Hey, what's up, buddy?

2770
02:06:54,000 --> 02:06:56,000
This is Act F. For some reason,

2771
02:06:56,000 --> 02:06:58,000
I couldn't hear you, but okay.

2772
02:06:58,000 --> 02:07:00,000
That's okay. We're here now. How you doing, Act F?

2773
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:02,000
What's on your mind, buddy?

2774
02:07:02,000 --> 02:07:04,000
Well, there's lots and lots of my mind.

2775
02:07:04,000 --> 02:07:06,000
Especially with what happened

2776
02:07:06,000 --> 02:07:08,000
last weekend.

2777
02:07:08,000 --> 02:07:10,000
And how it happened, especially.

2778
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:14,000
But, other than that,

2779
02:07:14,000 --> 02:07:16,000
you talked about

2780
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:18,000
the Walmart story and

2781
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:20,000
how they tried to

2782
02:07:20,000 --> 02:07:22,000
pretty much,

2783
02:07:22,000 --> 02:07:24,000
like,

2784
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:26,000
don't know if they tried to fix

2785
02:07:26,000 --> 02:07:28,000
something, to try to do something

2786
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:30,000
about it, but

2787
02:07:30,000 --> 02:07:32,000
it was the most

2788
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:34,000
stupid

2789
02:07:34,000 --> 02:07:36,000
way to do it. Like, oh my god.

2790
02:07:36,000 --> 02:07:38,000
I'm actually, like,

2791
02:07:38,000 --> 02:07:40,000
angry about it.

2792
02:07:40,000 --> 02:07:42,000
Yeah, like, I'm irritated they're

2793
02:07:42,000 --> 02:07:44,000
buying into this narrative

2794
02:07:44,000 --> 02:07:46,000
that has no place

2795
02:07:46,000 --> 02:07:48,000
in the discussion anyway

2796
02:07:48,000 --> 02:07:50,000
when there is nothing to prove

2797
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:52,000
that any of these, you know,

2798
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:54,000
disgusting people that committed these acts

2799
02:07:54,000 --> 02:07:56,000
whose names I cannot recall,

2800
02:07:56,000 --> 02:07:58,000
nor do I wish to recall,

2801
02:07:58,000 --> 02:08:00,000
that these people were gamers

2802
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:02,000
or playing video games or even influenced

2803
02:08:02,000 --> 02:08:04,000
by games. And even if they did play

2804
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:06,000
a video game here and there, who

2805
02:08:06,000 --> 02:08:08,000
doesn't play video games here and there these days?

2806
02:08:08,000 --> 02:08:10,000
It's just, you know,

2807
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:12,000
it's just, it's, again, it's a scapegoat.

2808
02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:14,000
Like, it's distracting from the real

2809
02:08:14,000 --> 02:08:16,000
issue. You can say the same thing about, like,

2810
02:08:16,000 --> 02:08:18,000
well, this person eats pizza, or the

2811
02:08:18,000 --> 02:08:20,000
killer ate pizza, therefore pizza

2812
02:08:20,000 --> 02:08:22,000
has caused him to kill. Exactly, exactly.

2813
02:08:22,000 --> 02:08:24,000
It's just trying to find, or they

2814
02:08:24,000 --> 02:08:26,000
ate Beyond Burgers, and, you know,

2815
02:08:26,000 --> 02:08:28,000
it's just... You hear that?

2816
02:08:28,000 --> 02:08:30,000
That's a cause I'm willing to give up.

2817
02:08:30,000 --> 02:08:32,000
Anyway, no, but, like, it's just,

2818
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:34,000
it is gross, and it makes me angry, like,

2819
02:08:34,000 --> 02:08:36,000
as a gamer and somebody who's tried so

2820
02:08:36,000 --> 02:08:38,000
hard over the years to promote maybe, like, a more

2821
02:08:38,000 --> 02:08:40,000
positive gamer culture, and, like,

2822
02:08:40,000 --> 02:08:42,000
positivity in gaming, like, it's just, it's

2823
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:44,000
really irritating to get

2824
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:46,000
this kind of garbage. And I'm not

2825
02:08:46,000 --> 02:08:48,000
gonna say the gaming scene's already been, always

2826
02:08:48,000 --> 02:08:50,000
been perfect, but, like, this is garbage

2827
02:08:50,000 --> 02:08:52,000
stuff that we don't deserve to be

2828
02:08:52,000 --> 02:08:54,000
associated with, you know?

2829
02:08:54,000 --> 02:08:56,000
And, and, and especially because

2830
02:08:56,000 --> 02:08:58,000
I could probably talk about

2831
02:08:58,000 --> 02:09:00,000
the, the,

2832
02:09:00,000 --> 02:09:02,000
and this, this is the most

2833
02:09:02,000 --> 02:09:04,000
worrying thing about

2834
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:06,000
how it happened, because it was

2835
02:09:06,000 --> 02:09:08,000
a racial thing. It was,

2836
02:09:08,000 --> 02:09:10,000
the...

2837
02:09:10,000 --> 02:09:12,000
I really don't wanna talk about it that

2838
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:14,000
much, but... No, I get it. It's,

2839
02:09:14,000 --> 02:09:16,000
it's fucking infuriating, and

2840
02:09:16,000 --> 02:09:18,000
we get it. Like, we totally,

2841
02:09:18,000 --> 02:09:20,000
like, it's, I'm disgusted.

2842
02:09:20,000 --> 02:09:22,000
As, as, you're disgusted.

2843
02:09:22,000 --> 02:09:24,000
We're all disgusted. But, but, yeah, like,

2844
02:09:24,000 --> 02:09:26,000
always, oh,

2845
02:09:26,000 --> 02:09:28,000
video games have the, are the problem,

2846
02:09:28,000 --> 02:09:30,000
or this is the problem.

2847
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:32,000
And they're not, no, nobody

2848
02:09:32,000 --> 02:09:34,000
is doing, like, at least

2849
02:09:34,000 --> 02:09:36,000
in, in the people who have the power,

2850
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:38,000
who have the means, and,

2851
02:09:38,000 --> 02:09:40,000
and all that,

2852
02:09:40,000 --> 02:09:42,000
to do something, aren't doing anything.

2853
02:09:42,000 --> 02:09:44,000
Which is the most baffling.

2854
02:09:44,000 --> 02:09:46,000
It's like... It's very

2855
02:09:46,000 --> 02:09:48,000
simple. Video games do not

2856
02:09:48,000 --> 02:09:50,000
teach racism. That comes

2857
02:09:50,000 --> 02:09:52,000
from somewhere else. And

2858
02:09:52,000 --> 02:09:54,000
that El Paso attack was

2859
02:09:54,000 --> 02:09:56,000
racism.

2860
02:09:56,000 --> 02:09:58,000
Right? Yeah, definitely.

2861
02:09:58,000 --> 02:10:00,000
They didn't learn that in a video game.

2862
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:02,000
I don't know. I did learn

2863
02:10:02,000 --> 02:10:04,000
that Skyrim is only for the Nords.

2864
02:10:04,000 --> 02:10:06,000
Not even the time to joke. Not

2865
02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:08,000
even the time. Like, it's just,

2866
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:10,000
it's, it's, it's, like,

2867
02:10:10,000 --> 02:10:12,000
let's call it what it is. It was a racially

2868
02:10:12,000 --> 02:10:14,000
motivated attack that no

2869
02:10:14,000 --> 02:10:16,000
video game fucking taught them.

2870
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:18,000
No, and,

2871
02:10:18,000 --> 02:10:20,000
and so many, and that's

2872
02:10:20,000 --> 02:10:22,000
a cool thing about the video game

2873
02:10:22,000 --> 02:10:24,000
community. Because that,

2874
02:10:24,000 --> 02:10:26,000
all that happened the

2875
02:10:26,000 --> 02:10:28,000
same time EVO was happening.

2876
02:10:28,000 --> 02:10:30,000
And so many people there were having

2877
02:10:30,000 --> 02:10:32,000
such a great time.

2878
02:10:32,000 --> 02:10:34,000
We even see, like, the

2879
02:10:34,000 --> 02:10:36,000
competition level, that

2880
02:10:36,000 --> 02:10:38,000
many people can get salty,

2881
02:10:38,000 --> 02:10:40,000
and probably get mad at the

2882
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:42,000
other that they won,

2883
02:10:42,000 --> 02:10:44,000
they lost. But even

2884
02:10:44,000 --> 02:10:46,000
then, we have, like, people like

2885
02:10:46,000 --> 02:10:48,000
SonicFox and Goichi, if

2886
02:10:48,000 --> 02:10:50,000
anyone in, like, you or in chat

2887
02:10:50,000 --> 02:10:52,000
saw the Dragon Ball

2888
02:10:52,000 --> 02:10:54,000
Fighter finals. They were, like,

2889
02:10:54,000 --> 02:10:56,000
like, really

2890
02:10:56,000 --> 02:10:58,000
good pals from, like,

2891
02:10:58,000 --> 02:11:00,000
for many years. And they have probably

2892
02:11:00,000 --> 02:11:02,000
met, like, in the past two years.

2893
02:11:02,000 --> 02:11:04,000
And they were having a great time.

2894
02:11:04,000 --> 02:11:06,000
So many people there that

2895
02:11:06,000 --> 02:11:08,000
that were

2896
02:11:08,000 --> 02:11:10,000
for the games, and not because

2897
02:11:10,000 --> 02:11:12,000
oh, I'm better than you, and

2898
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:14,000
or

2899
02:11:14,000 --> 02:11:16,000
other stupid stuff that can probably

2900
02:11:16,000 --> 02:11:18,000
trigger something like that.

2901
02:11:18,000 --> 02:11:20,000
But no, like, really

2902
02:11:20,000 --> 02:11:22,000
people have to

2903
02:11:22,000 --> 02:11:24,000
see the bigger picture, like,

2904
02:11:24,000 --> 02:11:26,000
at all, because

2905
02:11:26,000 --> 02:11:28,000
again, this is really frustrating

2906
02:11:28,000 --> 02:11:30,000
because it's coming from, like,

2907
02:11:30,000 --> 02:11:32,000
a sort of personal

2908
02:11:32,000 --> 02:11:34,000
thing, and

2909
02:11:34,000 --> 02:11:36,000
but, again, it's

2910
02:11:36,000 --> 02:11:38,000
like, people

2911
02:11:38,000 --> 02:11:40,000
and

2912
02:11:40,000 --> 02:11:42,000
you have to do something.

2913
02:11:42,000 --> 02:11:44,000
Call your representatives.

2914
02:11:44,000 --> 02:11:46,000
Like,

2915
02:11:46,000 --> 02:11:48,000
call for

2916
02:11:48,000 --> 02:11:50,000
something to be done

2917
02:11:50,000 --> 02:11:52,000
because

2918
02:11:52,000 --> 02:11:54,000
Walmart pulling, like, stuff

2919
02:11:54,000 --> 02:11:56,000
and again, it's just stupid stuff.

2920
02:11:56,000 --> 02:11:58,000
It's, again, frustrating that they did

2921
02:11:58,000 --> 02:12:00,000
that because, oh, my God,

2922
02:12:00,000 --> 02:12:02,000
it happened to

2923
02:12:02,000 --> 02:12:04,000
because of this, and maybe

2924
02:12:04,000 --> 02:12:06,000
because of this, not necessarily

2925
02:12:06,000 --> 02:12:08,000
because of it.

2926
02:12:08,000 --> 02:12:10,000
Yeah, you know, I'm fortunate that I live in a state

2927
02:12:10,000 --> 02:12:12,000
where we're represented by people

2928
02:12:12,000 --> 02:12:14,000
in Congress that are very much, like,

2929
02:12:14,000 --> 02:12:16,000
trying to

2930
02:12:16,000 --> 02:12:18,000
fight this and make something happen.

2931
02:12:18,000 --> 02:12:20,000
For example, one of our senators here

2932
02:12:20,000 --> 02:12:22,000
from California you may have heard of before,

2933
02:12:22,000 --> 02:12:24,000
her name's Kamala Harris, and she has lots

2934
02:12:24,000 --> 02:12:26,000
to say about these different issues. And again, I'm not

2935
02:12:26,000 --> 02:12:28,000
going to wade into politics because I understand,

2936
02:12:28,000 --> 02:12:30,000
but the reality is, like, you know,

2937
02:12:30,000 --> 02:12:32,000
I do feel like at least, you know,

2938
02:12:32,000 --> 02:12:34,000
but that doesn't mean I shouldn't call them and at least

2939
02:12:34,000 --> 02:12:36,000
kind of support in the direction that they're going,

2940
02:12:36,000 --> 02:12:38,000
but, you know, it is, it's like

2941
02:12:38,000 --> 02:12:40,000
we told the story about the governor that got

2942
02:12:40,000 --> 02:12:42,000
drowned out when he was trying to give the speech

2943
02:12:42,000 --> 02:12:44,000
to do something, and then finally, how about

2944
02:12:44,000 --> 02:12:46,000
that, it made it, it made an attempt,

2945
02:12:46,000 --> 02:12:48,000
there was an attempt

2946
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:50,000
to do something, finally.

2947
02:12:50,000 --> 02:12:52,000
So, you know, it's that, it's really

2948
02:12:52,000 --> 02:12:54,000
pissed off people that are going to make the difference.

2949
02:12:54,000 --> 02:12:56,000
And, you know, as a gamer,

2950
02:12:56,000 --> 02:12:58,000
I'm sitting here, and I think a lot of us have to

2951
02:12:58,000 --> 02:13:00,000
sit here going, hell no, you're not

2952
02:13:00,000 --> 02:13:02,000
pinning this on us. This is not

2953
02:13:02,000 --> 02:13:04,000
our fault.

2954
02:13:04,000 --> 02:13:06,000
Period.

2955
02:13:06,000 --> 02:13:08,000
And, yeah, we, as

2956
02:13:08,000 --> 02:13:10,000
us people, even like

2957
02:13:10,000 --> 02:13:12,000
me living in Mexico, I have to,

2958
02:13:12,000 --> 02:13:14,000
at least I feel like the obligation

2959
02:13:14,000 --> 02:13:16,000
to do, like, something, at least

2960
02:13:16,000 --> 02:13:18,000
spread the word. But, yeah,

2961
02:13:18,000 --> 02:13:20,000
hopefully, things will get better.

2962
02:13:20,000 --> 02:13:22,000
Hopefully, I

2963
02:13:22,000 --> 02:13:24,000
want to be, like, really positive about it, but,

2964
02:13:24,000 --> 02:13:26,000
like, again,

2965
02:13:26,000 --> 02:13:28,000
this time was, like, wow,

2966
02:13:28,000 --> 02:13:30,000
I cannot even

2967
02:13:30,000 --> 02:13:32,000
fathom, I cannot imagine,

2968
02:13:32,000 --> 02:13:34,000
like, the horror,

2969
02:13:34,000 --> 02:13:36,000
the horror that people

2970
02:13:36,000 --> 02:13:38,000
that are like me

2971
02:13:38,000 --> 02:13:40,000
lived through that, like, oh my god.

2972
02:13:40,000 --> 02:13:42,000
At some point,

2973
02:13:42,000 --> 02:13:44,000
for what little relief it is, and I

2974
02:13:44,000 --> 02:13:46,000
mean little relief, at some

2975
02:13:46,000 --> 02:13:48,000
point, this generation

2976
02:13:48,000 --> 02:13:50,000
that has had to grow up with metal

2977
02:13:50,000 --> 02:13:52,000
detectors in schools, bulletproof

2978
02:13:52,000 --> 02:13:54,000
backpacks, drills

2979
02:13:54,000 --> 02:13:56,000
on what to do with an active shooter,

2980
02:13:56,000 --> 02:13:58,000
and things that I can't even

2981
02:13:58,000 --> 02:14:00,000
imagine going through. Like, I remember

2982
02:14:00,000 --> 02:14:02,000
the earthquake grill was the scariest thing I went

2983
02:14:02,000 --> 02:14:04,000
through when I was seven years old. Think about the

2984
02:14:04,000 --> 02:14:06,000
bullshit kids today have to deal with.

2985
02:14:06,000 --> 02:14:08,000
What little solace there is, is that

2986
02:14:08,000 --> 02:14:10,000
someday, that generation

2987
02:14:10,000 --> 02:14:12,000
that had to grow up with all that

2988
02:14:12,000 --> 02:14:14,000
bullshit is going to be the one

2989
02:14:14,000 --> 02:14:16,000
that is holding office

2990
02:14:16,000 --> 02:14:18,000
and making decisions. And do you

2991
02:14:18,000 --> 02:14:20,000
think that folks that are that young,

2992
02:14:20,000 --> 02:14:22,000
in fact, in general, folks

2993
02:14:22,000 --> 02:14:24,000
under 30, and I'm very much generalizing

2994
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:26,000
because there's folks older than that,

2995
02:14:26,000 --> 02:14:28,000
like myself, that definitely agree

2996
02:14:28,000 --> 02:14:30,000
that something needs to be done, but the reality is, as

2997
02:14:30,000 --> 02:14:32,000
these younger folks that have had to grow

2998
02:14:32,000 --> 02:14:34,000
up in this culture and all this

2999
02:14:34,000 --> 02:14:36,000
bullshit around them is going to someday be

3000
02:14:36,000 --> 02:14:38,000
the ones in charge, things will

3001
02:14:38,000 --> 02:14:40,000
change. It's just

3002
02:14:40,000 --> 02:14:42,000
not changing fast enough,

3003
02:14:42,000 --> 02:14:44,000
unfortunately.

3004
02:14:44,000 --> 02:14:46,000
Yeah, we just have to wait,

3005
02:14:46,000 --> 02:14:48,000
be patient, and hope

3006
02:14:48,000 --> 02:14:50,000
for the best. That's definitely

3007
02:14:50,000 --> 02:14:52,000
the thing we can probably do

3008
02:14:52,000 --> 02:14:54,000
right now, but yeah, we need to

3009
02:14:54,000 --> 02:14:56,000
speak up. Like, not as gamers,

3010
02:14:56,000 --> 02:14:58,000
not as hobbyists,

3011
02:14:58,000 --> 02:15:00,000
but as people.

3012
02:15:00,000 --> 02:15:02,000
Absolutely.

3013
02:15:02,000 --> 02:15:04,000
I'm with you 100% on that.

3014
02:15:04,000 --> 02:15:06,000
Act Deaf. I'm glad it's something that, you know,

3015
02:15:06,000 --> 02:15:08,000
despite the fact that we are from two different countries,

3016
02:15:08,000 --> 02:15:10,000
it's something that kind of we can come together

3017
02:15:10,000 --> 02:15:12,000
and agree on. So, I appreciate your

3018
02:15:12,000 --> 02:15:14,000
call very much, my friend, so

3019
02:15:14,000 --> 02:15:16,000
take care. And hey, I

3020
02:15:16,000 --> 02:15:18,000
heard your podcast kind of made a move this week.

3021
02:15:18,000 --> 02:15:20,000
Yeah,

3022
02:15:20,000 --> 02:15:22,000
GFMcast, we're

3023
02:15:22,000 --> 02:15:24,000
sorry, we're still transmitting on

3024
02:15:24,000 --> 02:15:26,000
YouTube, but

3025
02:15:26,000 --> 02:15:28,000
since Google Hangouts is

3026
02:15:28,000 --> 02:15:30,000
just pretty much dead

3027
02:15:30,000 --> 02:15:32,000
for the most part,

3028
02:15:32,000 --> 02:15:34,000
we're doing some changes

3029
02:15:34,000 --> 02:15:36,000
and maybe in the future

3030
02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:38,000
we'll move to Twitch

3031
02:15:38,000 --> 02:15:40,000
too. It depends on how

3032
02:15:40,000 --> 02:15:42,000
YouTube acts in the following months, but

3033
02:15:42,000 --> 02:15:44,000
for now, we're

3034
02:15:44,000 --> 02:15:46,000
sticking to YouTube. You can

3035
02:15:46,000 --> 02:15:48,000
check us out if you like or you speak

3036
02:15:48,000 --> 02:15:50,000
Spanish.

3037
02:15:50,000 --> 02:15:52,000
Anyone, GFMcast or

3038
02:15:52,000 --> 02:15:54,000
JefemeCast on YouTube.

3039
02:15:54,000 --> 02:15:56,000
We also have GFMcast.com

3040
02:15:56,000 --> 02:15:58,000
so you can check out all our episodes.

3041
02:15:58,000 --> 02:16:00,000
All right. Wonderful. For our Spanish

3042
02:16:00,000 --> 02:16:02,000
speaking audience, I would highly recommend it

3043
02:16:02,000 --> 02:16:04,000
simply because I don't know anybody else

3044
02:16:04,000 --> 02:16:06,000
that does a Spanish speaking podcast that listens

3045
02:16:06,000 --> 02:16:08,000
to this show, and I really

3046
02:16:08,000 --> 02:16:10,000
wish I could listen and, you know,

3047
02:16:10,000 --> 02:16:12,000
be able to participate, but

3048
02:16:12,000 --> 02:16:14,000
all I can do is support you from a distance, my friend.

3049
02:16:14,000 --> 02:16:16,000
Hey, no problem. Thanks for the

3050
02:16:16,000 --> 02:16:18,000
plug. Yeah. Anytime.

3051
02:16:18,000 --> 02:16:20,000
Take care, buddy. You too.

3052
02:16:20,000 --> 02:16:22,000
All right. Well, that's the only

3053
02:16:22,000 --> 02:16:24,000
call that was waiting in the green room for us tonight,

3054
02:16:24,000 --> 02:16:26,000
so we're going to go ahead and probably

3055
02:16:26,000 --> 02:16:28,000
close down Discord at this point,

3056
02:16:28,000 --> 02:16:30,000
but thank you to ActDeft. If somebody else

3057
02:16:30,000 --> 02:16:32,000
decided they wanted to get in and got

3058
02:16:32,000 --> 02:16:34,000
a little shy or whatever and didn't end up calling

3059
02:16:34,000 --> 02:16:36,000
in, you can always send us an email, of course.

3060
02:16:36,000 --> 02:16:38,000
Participate at Orangelaungerator.com

3061
02:16:38,000 --> 02:16:40,000
or you can send us a tweet, Twitter.com

3062
02:16:40,000 --> 02:16:42,000
slash O-L-R. Those are

3063
02:16:42,000 --> 02:16:44,000
all great ways to contact the show

3064
02:16:44,000 --> 02:16:46,000
as well. Do we have any

3065
02:16:46,000 --> 02:16:48,000
last minute stories

3066
02:16:48,000 --> 02:16:50,000
as we start to wrap

3067
02:16:50,000 --> 02:16:52,000
up tonight? No, that was pretty much it.

3068
02:16:52,000 --> 02:16:54,000
Yeah, that was a big one. That's Cookie Mama's return.

3069
02:16:54,000 --> 02:16:56,000
That's a pretty big one. Later this fall,

3070
02:16:56,000 --> 02:16:58,000
so we'll have to see. All right. Then I guess

3071
02:16:58,000 --> 02:17:00,000
we will start to wrap up a little bit

3072
02:17:00,000 --> 02:17:02,000
here, so thank you, as always,

3073
02:17:02,000 --> 02:17:04,000
for joining us. Whether you are here live

3074
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:06,000
on Twitch or listening on our podcast

3075
02:17:06,000 --> 02:17:08,000
feed or finding episodes

3076
02:17:08,000 --> 02:17:10,000
over at VoGnetwork.com.

3077
02:17:10,000 --> 02:17:12,000
Really appreciate

3078
02:17:12,000 --> 02:17:14,000
all the different ways

3079
02:17:14,000 --> 02:17:16,000
that you guys

3080
02:17:16,000 --> 02:17:18,000
participate with our show and

3081
02:17:18,000 --> 02:17:20,000
listen to us and support us.

3082
02:17:20,000 --> 02:17:22,000
All we say is, you know,

3083
02:17:22,000 --> 02:17:24,000
although we really appreciate the subs

3084
02:17:24,000 --> 02:17:26,000
here at VoGnetwork and the bitty

3085
02:17:26,000 --> 02:17:28,000
donations, the bits and all that, we

3086
02:17:28,000 --> 02:17:30,000
super appreciate all that. You know what?

3087
02:17:30,000 --> 02:17:32,000
All you really have to do, all we ask,

3088
02:17:32,000 --> 02:17:34,000
we don't need money, but

3089
02:17:34,000 --> 02:17:36,000
if you tell a friend or two about the show, help us

3090
02:17:36,000 --> 02:17:38,000
spread the word because we are the show where every gamer

3091
02:17:38,000 --> 02:17:40,000
has a voice, but, you know, if the voices aren't

3092
02:17:40,000 --> 02:17:42,000
here, if they're not in our Discord lobby waiting to call in

3093
02:17:42,000 --> 02:17:44,000
or in our chat room giving us feedback,

3094
02:17:44,000 --> 02:17:46,000
we can't put them out on the air. We can't have

3095
02:17:46,000 --> 02:17:48,000
that dialogue, so please

3096
02:17:48,000 --> 02:17:50,000
help us spread the word. Word of mouth is so, so

3097
02:17:50,000 --> 02:17:52,000
powerful. A nice five-star review

3098
02:17:52,000 --> 02:17:54,000
on a site like iTunes or wherever

3099
02:17:54,000 --> 02:17:56,000
you found this podcast. That stuff

3100
02:17:56,000 --> 02:17:58,000
goes a very long way. Yes, I know

3101
02:17:58,000 --> 02:18:00,000
we need to get on Spotify. We'll

3102
02:18:00,000 --> 02:18:02,000
work on that in the very near future.

3103
02:18:02,000 --> 02:18:04,000
In the meantime, though, it's about time

3104
02:18:04,000 --> 02:18:06,000
to wrap up, so I guess we'll

3105
02:18:06,000 --> 02:18:08,000
get around, go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

3106
02:18:08,000 --> 02:18:10,000
Um, I'll start tonight. So my final thought is

3107
02:18:10,000 --> 02:18:12,000
that Final Tribal Council's tomorrow

3108
02:18:12,000 --> 02:18:14,000
night of this 51-day game I've been

3109
02:18:14,000 --> 02:18:16,000
playing, and I'm just, I'm just,

3110
02:18:16,000 --> 02:18:18,000
cross your fingers, like

3111
02:18:18,000 --> 02:18:20,000
I would, I would really be honored to be the winner,

3112
02:18:20,000 --> 02:18:22,000
but if I'm not, then it wasn't in the cards

3113
02:18:22,000 --> 02:18:24,000
for that to happen. Are they supposed to have, like,

3114
02:18:24,000 --> 02:18:26,000
this livestream or something like that? It's all

3115
02:18:26,000 --> 02:18:28,000
going to be on YouTube, so I'll post the link to Twitter

3116
02:18:28,000 --> 02:18:30,000
if you guys want to see it and watch, watch me

3117
02:18:30,000 --> 02:18:32,000
get eaten alive by the jury and all that.

3118
02:18:32,000 --> 02:18:34,000
Although, like, I'm trying to think back.

3119
02:18:34,000 --> 02:18:36,000
At least, like, five of them,

3120
02:18:36,000 --> 02:18:38,000
I think, wait, I'm thinking back in my mind.

3121
02:18:38,000 --> 02:18:40,000
I think, like, five of them wrote my

3122
02:18:40,000 --> 02:18:42,000
name down at some point, so they can't be too upset.

3123
02:18:42,000 --> 02:18:44,000
But we'll see, we'll see how it goes.

3124
02:18:44,000 --> 02:18:46,000
Uh, so we'll see how the, um,

3125
02:18:46,000 --> 02:18:48,000
uh, Final Tribal goes tomorrow, but wish me luck.

3126
02:18:48,000 --> 02:18:50,000
Cross your fingers. If I win,

3127
02:18:50,000 --> 02:18:52,000
you know the, I told you the prize I get if I win, right?

3128
02:18:52,000 --> 02:18:54,000
No. Oh. Uh, if I win,

3129
02:18:54,000 --> 02:18:56,000
you get a blanket.

3130
02:18:56,000 --> 02:18:58,000
And the blanket can have

3131
02:18:58,000 --> 02:19:00,000
one of two things on it. You can have either the

3132
02:19:00,000 --> 02:19:02,000
logo for the season, so I would get

3133
02:19:02,000 --> 02:19:04,000
the, the power, because that's the name of the game,

3134
02:19:04,000 --> 02:19:06,000
is Power Org, so I would get the Power Org

3135
02:19:06,000 --> 02:19:08,000
logo on it, or the other option is to get

3136
02:19:08,000 --> 02:19:10,000
your face on it.

3137
02:19:10,000 --> 02:19:12,000
Now, Loki, you've known me a very long time.

3138
02:19:12,000 --> 02:19:14,000
Which of those two am I going to be getting if I win?

3139
02:19:14,000 --> 02:19:16,000
Oh, you're getting your face on it. I am absolutely getting the one with my face

3140
02:19:16,000 --> 02:19:18,000
on it, so, uh, you will hopefully

3141
02:19:18,000 --> 02:19:20,000
see that hanging here, if

3142
02:19:20,000 --> 02:19:22,000
I am successful tomorrow night.

3143
02:19:22,000 --> 02:19:24,000
Otherwise, uh, Felix

3144
02:19:24,000 --> 02:19:26,000
out in Montreal, who's the other finalist,

3145
02:19:26,000 --> 02:19:28,000
will get, I guess, I don't know if he's getting his

3146
02:19:28,000 --> 02:19:30,000
face or what, but one of us is going to get

3147
02:19:30,000 --> 02:19:32,000
that blanket, so we'll see what happens.

3148
02:19:32,000 --> 02:19:34,000
So, alright, that's my final thought.

3149
02:19:34,000 --> 02:19:36,000
Your final thought, Loki. My final thought is

3150
02:19:36,000 --> 02:19:38,000
I'm still working on trying to come up

3151
02:19:38,000 --> 02:19:40,000
with a game design for,

3152
02:19:40,000 --> 02:19:42,000
um, whatever I'm supposed to be

3153
02:19:42,000 --> 02:19:44,000
teaching kids about and stuff.

3154
02:19:44,000 --> 02:19:46,000
I actually had some pretty decent, um,

3155
02:19:46,000 --> 02:19:48,000
efforts on that, so we may see something

3156
02:19:48,000 --> 02:19:50,000
on there. I did work on my game a little bit this week.

3157
02:19:50,000 --> 02:19:52,000
Um, didn't get anywhere on that, because

3158
02:19:52,000 --> 02:19:54,000
I'm still trying to get,

3159
02:19:54,000 --> 02:19:56,000
I don't know, I had done this before

3160
02:19:56,000 --> 02:19:58,000
in, like, a previous game I made, where

3161
02:19:58,000 --> 02:20:00,000
I was, like, trying to lock the player to the

3162
02:20:00,000 --> 02:20:02,000
screen, but now

3163
02:20:02,000 --> 02:20:04,000
it's locking to the camera view, and

3164
02:20:04,000 --> 02:20:06,000
it's not right, so I

3165
02:20:06,000 --> 02:20:08,000
had to fix something in my code, because I can

3166
02:20:08,000 --> 02:20:10,000
scroll out of the screen if I drag

3167
02:20:10,000 --> 02:20:12,000
along the bottom, and it's not

3168
02:20:12,000 --> 02:20:14,000
supposed to be doing that. That would be a glitch,

3169
02:20:14,000 --> 02:20:16,000
so, um, still working

3170
02:20:16,000 --> 02:20:18,000
on that. Thank you for all the

3171
02:20:18,000 --> 02:20:20,000
love and chat, everybody. I'm feeling,

3172
02:20:20,000 --> 02:20:22,000
I'm feeling the love, so. Alright,

3173
02:20:22,000 --> 02:20:24,000
that's it. We're wrapped up for tonight.

3174
02:20:24,000 --> 02:20:26,000
We'll be back next week for, um, our

3175
02:20:26,000 --> 02:20:28,000
last live show of August, believe it or not,

3176
02:20:28,000 --> 02:20:30,000
uh, with Dark Soccer here in

3177
02:20:30,000 --> 02:20:32,000
studios, and then we're gonna be on a quick

3178
02:20:32,000 --> 02:20:34,000
little, we'll have a pre-taped

3179
02:20:34,000 --> 02:20:36,000
show again, uh, in two weeks

3180
02:20:36,000 --> 02:20:38,000
on August the 25th, because, again,

3181
02:20:38,000 --> 02:20:40,000
I'm flying out back east on the 24th,

3182
02:20:40,000 --> 02:20:42,000
and then Labor Day weekend, uh,

3183
02:20:42,000 --> 02:20:44,000
DragonCon will be going on, and we'll be hosting

3184
02:20:44,000 --> 02:20:46,000
their panels. I don't think we have anything on

3185
02:20:46,000 --> 02:20:48,000
Sunday night, maybe, I think there might have been a

3186
02:20:48,000 --> 02:20:50,000
Sunday 5.30 thing, I don't know, I don't think we have

3187
02:20:50,000 --> 02:20:52,000
anything, but, and I don't remember Bobby's

3188
02:20:52,000 --> 02:20:54,000
schedule off the top of my head, but there will be

3189
02:20:54,000 --> 02:20:56,000
some awesome panel that we'll be hosting that you

3190
02:20:56,000 --> 02:20:58,000
can see instead next week live on

3191
02:20:58,000 --> 02:21:00,000
Twitch, and for you podcast folk,

3192
02:21:00,000 --> 02:21:02,000
we'll be back, um, um, live

3193
02:21:02,000 --> 02:21:04,000
after that, uh, this, what, second

3194
02:21:04,000 --> 02:21:06,000
weekend of September, I guess at that point, so.

3195
02:21:06,000 --> 02:21:08,000
But we will be here next week, so don't,

3196
02:21:08,000 --> 02:21:10,000
like, you know, don't, don't make new plans yet.

3197
02:21:10,000 --> 02:21:12,000
We'll see you in seven days here on

3198
02:21:12,000 --> 02:21:14,000
Twitch, and you guys get to find out if

3199
02:21:14,000 --> 02:21:16,000
I won or not on that game.

3200
02:21:16,000 --> 02:21:18,000
I will, I'll actually get to play some more

3201
02:21:18,000 --> 02:21:20,000
video games this week. Maybe Loki will make

3202
02:21:20,000 --> 02:21:22,000
progress on his game, I don't know. Alright.

3203
02:21:22,000 --> 02:21:24,000
So, there you go. Uh, oh,

3204
02:21:24,000 --> 02:21:26,000
Bobby reminding me that we watch the

3205
02:21:26,000 --> 02:21:28,000
Masquerade and the VoG Suite on Sunday night

3206
02:21:28,000 --> 02:21:30,000
at the normal time, that's technically our

3207
02:21:30,000 --> 02:21:32,000
sweet party, you're right, that usually is kind of

3208
02:21:32,000 --> 02:21:34,000
what's going on at that time, but there'll

3209
02:21:34,000 --> 02:21:36,000
still be panels, like, podcasting,

3210
02:21:36,000 --> 02:21:38,000
or, excuse me, digital media tracks still has panels

3211
02:21:38,000 --> 02:21:40,000
that time, right? They might just do, that

3212
02:21:40,000 --> 02:21:42,000
might be some of their big ballroom panels, like

3213
02:21:42,000 --> 02:21:44,000
the, um, for

3214
02:21:44,000 --> 02:21:46,000
Truce and a Lie, I'm screwing up these

3215
02:21:46,000 --> 02:21:48,000
names of the shows, I'm sorry, there's that one

3216
02:21:48,000 --> 02:21:50,000
Truce and a Lie panel, Night Attack is

3217
02:21:50,000 --> 02:21:52,000
almost always there, they do something, and

3218
02:21:52,000 --> 02:21:54,000
so they'll probably be a big ballroom thing, who knows.

3219
02:21:54,000 --> 02:21:56,000
Anyway, yeah, Bobby says they'll have

3220
02:21:56,000 --> 02:21:58,000
panels, we just won't be on them. Got it.

3221
02:21:58,000 --> 02:22:00,000
Alright. Um,

3222
02:22:00,000 --> 02:22:02,000
that's it. I guess, I guess

3223
02:22:02,000 --> 02:22:04,000
we're done. Roll credits, right?

3224
02:22:04,000 --> 02:22:06,000
We'll see you guys in seven days. Good night.

3225
02:22:06,000 --> 02:22:08,000
