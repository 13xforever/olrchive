7000	14000	With your hosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
14000	21000	This week a big box store chain cuts back on gaming displays while still selling lethal weapons one aisle away from bikes and children's toys. Truly the arbiter of morality.
21000	27000	This is just one story we've heard too many times before. Stay tuned for the rest of the week's gaming news starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.
28000	32000	Orange Lounge Radio
32000	38000	Hello my friends out there on the internet. Welcome back to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
38000	43000	It is episode number 788 for this August the 11th of 2019.
43000	47000	My name is Rob Roberts and joining me here in studio live at Twitch TV.
47000	51000	Twitch TV slash VOG Network. The voice of Geeks Network.
51000	54000	Joining me here in studio is Techmaster Loki.
54000	63000	Yes, it's me. The guy that's shutting down all the background processes because I neglected to bring my power adapter for my laptop.
63000	64000	You're gonna have to vamp with the camera tonight.
64000	68000	It literally is gonna eat the battery in like no time flat.
68000	75000	You guys don't know like how much Loki multitasks. Well, you probably do know if you watch the show before you can usually see his head buried in a laptop.
75000	79000	And you know, he's on task. It's not like you're sitting there watching porn.
79000	84000	But you're, I don't think, but you know, you're looking at stories, last minute stories, things related to gaming.
84000	89000	Or I've seen you working on your game. Like I feel like you get more work done on your game here at OLR.
89000	91000	No, I don't work on it here.
91000	96000	Yeah, crazy. So yeah, so unfortunately your laptop battery seems to be dying.
96000	102000	Yeah, it's because I was stupid and it's because my kids were distracting me when I was packing up everything before I came over here.
102000	108000	So I did unplug it and wrap it up and set it down and then left. So, oh well.
108000	111000	Things happen sometimes. It's okay. So you're gonna try your best to get through the show.
111000	112000	Got my phone.
112000	115000	Yeah, you have the good old phone back up. We can find you a charger for that if need be.
115000	122000	Why haven't I introduced Dark Sakura? She's, we adore her. She's still very much a part of OLR, just not tonight.
122000	126000	So Dark Sakura's not with us tonight. She is at a Weird Al Yankovic concert.
126000	127000	Admitting word crimes.
127000	132000	Here in town. Weird Al Yankovic is in town. I'm kind of jealous. I would have liked to have gone to that.
132000	137000	I had no idea that it was happening tonight. But a fine excuse to miss OLR, honestly.
137000	140000	Like, I can't be mad. Like, I almost missed this show for Carly Rae Jepsen.
140000	143000	So it's only fair that she misses the show for Weird Al Yankovic. It's fine.
143000	146000	So we'll be back, or she will be back next week.
146000	151000	But we're here with you guys tonight in studio over at, again, Twitch TV slash vlog network,
151000	158000	where we do tape live every Sunday night at about six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.
158000	163000	Yeah. So you guys can join us in chat there. Bobby Black Wolf points out, actually,
163000	169000	he's probably performing word crimes right now. I've missed a show for Weird Al a few months back.
169000	170000	It's totally acceptable.
170000	175000	At Rum Jump Stomp saying Weird Al is the best concert I've ever been to.
175000	178000	I haven't seen Weird Al in concert. I feel like I'm missing out.
178000	180000	I have not either. And someday, maybe.
180000	182000	Who have I seen? I've seen a lot of good shows this year.
182000	187000	I mean, you know, I love my pop diva queens. So, you know, Carly Rae Jepsen was an amazing show, if you're into that.
187000	191000	I saw Robin earlier this year, which was phenomenal.
191000	195000	I've had the fortune of seeing some good concerts this year. So, yeah, I don't know.
195000	201000	I don't know if I've been to a lot of bad concerts. I've seen bad bands at concerts,
201000	204000	but I haven't seen just a lot of straight up bad concerts. Like, I've seen bad openers.
204000	207000	I can't think of the last concert I actually went to.
207000	210000	What about video game related concerts? How about this site?
210000	213000	And I'll ask you guys in chat, what video game concerts have you been to?
213000	217000	Well, the only one I went to is that Final Fantasy one, one year, I think.
217000	220000	Yeah. I'm pretty sure I've told this story on the show before.
220000	224000	And in fact, it might have been less than a month ago, but Alan and I, my husband Alan and I,
224000	228000	met in person for the first time at Video Games Live in Oakland,
228000	233000	the Tommy Tallarico show that travels around and, you know, has been everywhere in the past few years.
233000	237000	That was actually, we knew each other online on a site called LiveJournal for years and years,
237000	240000	but we actually met for the first time in person at a video game concert.
240000	246000	So, video games are part of the reason I'm in the home situation I'm in today, which is pretty cool.
246000	253000	And I would say, though, recently one concert I remember going to that I loved was when I was,
253000	256000	it was MAGFest, because MAGFest is, right, music and games.
256000	258000	I had a great time at MAGFest a couple of years I went.
258000	263000	And one of the years I went, they actually had somebody playing the game,
263000	266000	or there's some buddies, they pass it off every now and then,
266000	269000	but they were playing the game Journey, right?
269000	274000	Not about the 80s band, but the more recent artistic game for the PlayStation 3 and 4,
275000	279000	Journey, they were playing that with a live orchestra playing the music.
279000	280000	Oh, that's cool.
280000	283000	And it was, to quote a Keanu Reeves term, breathtaking.
283000	288000	So, it really was. There's no other word to describe it. It was an amazing concert. I love that.
288000	289000	So, yeah.
289000	295000	ActDef saying, my last video game concert was Capcom Live quite a few years ago.
295000	299000	Bobby Blackwolf saying, shame it's the first weekend in January regarding MAGFest.
299000	303000	Yeah, that timing, you know, I just know I won't be able to get back to MAGFest for a couple of years.
303000	304000	I'd love to go back.
304000	309000	Well, there's also MAGWest, which, gosh, if MAGWest wasn't this weekend,
309000	314000	then it's happening really soon because MAGWest, it was the week before Dragon Con,
314000	316000	but I think it's like two weeks before.
316000	318000	It's like either this weekend or next weekend. It's coming up real soon.
318000	323000	I always mean to get out there, but it's just, yeah, summer, a lot of busy weekends in the summer,
323000	326000	I usually end up with other commitments and so forth.
326000	328000	So, that happens.
328000	332000	So, I would love to see, you know, there's a lot of good musical performances at Dragon Con.
332000	335000	I don't remember if there's a lot of video game related things directly
335000	338000	because Dragon Con is more of a general nerd convention,
338000	341000	but I'm sure there's video game influence stuff.
341000	344000	I just haven't made my way down the halls to find yet.
344000	346000	So, but I'll talk more about Dragon Con in a little bit.
346000	349000	But first, we're going to get into tonight's kickoff topic.
349000	353000	So, some video game news, big, big change going on in the industry.
353000	354000	This is pretty huge.
354000	357000	Yeah, they're taking hints from all the regulation that's coming down the pipeline.
358000	362000	Apparently, the ESA made a statement saying that, hey, guess what?
362000	366000	Microsoft's Nintendo and Sony, they've all agreed on one thing,
366000	369000	and that is that they're going to make sure that on their platforms,
369000	372000	you know what the odds are for random loot boxes.
372000	377000	So, you'll actually be able to see what the odds are for specific games
377000	382000	and what they're going to feature and the rarities of different items
382000	384000	that you may get and probabilities and whatnot.
384000	390000	So, that's going to apply to new games and game updates that add loot box features,
390000	394000	and it would require the disclosure of the relative rarity or probabilities.
395000	400000	Now, I don't want to be that guy, but I'm going to be that guy,
400000	403000	because I feel like when we talked about loot boxes here on OLR,
403000	405000	when this controversy was breaking,
405000	407000	when it was really hitting a fever pitch around the legislation,
407000	409000	I want to say about six weeks ago,
409000	412000	when it looked like it might actually make its way to Congress and so forth,
412000	415000	I want to say that I said, you know who could fix this problem,
415000	419000	and you know who could stop this before it goes to the government
419000	421000	and the government makes the wrong decision,
421000	425000	because no matter where you are politically, I'm pretty sure we can all agree,
425000	428000	the government would have made the wrong decision on this.
428000	430000	At least this government.
430000	432000	Yeah, at least this government.
432000	434000	Maybe other governments would have done better.
434000	438000	But anyway, I believe I said, who could fix this?
438000	441000	Microsoft could fix this. Nintendo could fix this. Sony could fix this.
441000	445000	Now, the gag I didn't predict was that they would all do it together.
445000	448000	That's a gag. I did not see that one coming.
448000	450000	But I thought, oh, I kind of figured,
450000	452000	I thought Microsoft would be the first,
452000	455000	just because they do have involvement on PC and so forth,
455000	457000	that they would do something on their marketplace,
457000	459000	because I remember making the joke,
459000	462000	Nintendo would be last to the table, because hello, Nintendo went online.
462000	464000	So I remember this topic coming up.
464000	466000	But it is pretty, you know, it's funny,
466000	468000	because I also feel like that's been a running theme,
468000	472000	is that, you know, all these game companies kind of working together
472000	474000	for greater good all of a sudden, right?
474000	477000	We had a story just a few weeks ago about Sony and Microsoft
477000	481000	teaming up on cloud gaming in some regard, right?
481000	484000	So is the smoosh cameo actually happening on the stream?
484000	485000	You can see his head.
485000	487000	Just a little bit. Maybe if you let him walk in a little more.
487000	489000	He might hop up on that table. Who knows?
489000	492000	But anyway, not to distract too much from our podcast listeners,
492000	495000	but you know a smoosh cameo is always going to distract us here on OilOck.
495000	497000	Why did you stop petting me?
497000	503000	So anyway, it's really something that they've all kind of banded together in a way.
503000	505000	So there was the cloud gaming thing, but now there's this.
505000	511000	All three have come together to essentially end the loop box.
511000	513000	I mean, I don't know. Would you say this is the end?
513000	515000	Like, where do we go from here?
515000	517000	It's not the end. It's just now they're like, well, look, see,
517000	521000	we're being transparent about the randomization on it.
521000	526000	So that's why it's okay. See, we're being good.
526000	527000	Yeah, I gotcha.
527000	529000	It's not gambling, except it is.
529000	534000	Yeah. Well, but now it's less gambling now that you know the odds up front.
534000	536000	So there you go.
536000	538000	There you go. Hey, this is the moment you've been waiting for.
538000	540000	Look at that.
540000	544000	He is full on taking over now that Jamie's not here.
544000	546000	So center stage is going to clean himself right there.
546000	550000	Usually, her stuff is all up on this table here,
550000	554000	but Mr. Smoosh has just decided to make it its home tonight.
554000	556000	I can't wait till we get into gaming weeks,
556000	560000	because this fucking cat has done so much this week with gaming.
560000	562000	But anyway, I'll get to it. I'll get to it.
562000	569000	So anyway, but yeah, so it's interesting that all three have banded together.
569000	571000	But you don't think this is the end?
571000	572000	No, it's never the end.
572000	573000	It's not the end.
573000	574000	It's too much money to be the end.
574000	575000	Where do we go from here?
575000	577000	Do we think the amount of loop boxes will decrease
577000	580000	because we're seeing these companies take a stand?
580000	582000	Does this make it get bigger or what?
582000	585000	I think it's just not going to really affect anything.
585000	588000	I think it's just now making it more acceptable in the eyes of the publishers.
588000	591000	It's like because, oh hey, but we're letting you know what the odds are.
591000	595000	So you're making a decision to buy that.
595000	596000	You know what the odds are.
596000	598000	You're making the decision to do that.
598000	599000	Right.
599000	601000	Do you think more games adopt loop boxes,
601000	604000	or do you think we see this continued stepping back trend?
604000	607000	Because I think there's a quick little follow-up on this, right?
607000	609000	I think there's a fine line.
609000	612000	It's the same offenders that keep doing this,
612000	617000	and it's putting loop boxes in games that really don't need to have them
617000	618000	or putting them in there after the fact,
618000	622000	like Activision adding them to Crash Team Racing
622000	623000	after the game's been reviewed.
623000	626000	It's like, oh yeah, now we put it in there.
626000	628000	Ha, you already reviewed the game.
628000	630000	It's too late now.
630000	631000	You bought the game.
631000	632000	Now they're in there.
632000	634000	So I don't know.
634000	637000	But we do have a story about one game getting rid of loop boxes, right?
637000	638000	This is true, yes.
638000	641000	So Rocket League is getting rid of loop boxes.
641000	642000	That's right.
642000	644000	So they're going the route because, you may remember,
644000	647000	the parent company of Rocket League did get purchased by Epic Games,
647000	649000	so now they're taking their loop boxes
649000	655000	and actually doing a kind of loop system that's similar to Fortnite
655000	660000	in the sense that you'll kind of have a path laid out of,
660000	662000	like, here's the stuff you're going to unlock,
662000	664000	kind of like their season passes that they're going to have,
664000	666000	or they don't call them season passes.
666000	672000	They call them, like, battle passes or, like, their seasons that they have.
672000	674000	So that's how they're doing it.
674000	676000	So there's going to be transparency there,
676000	678000	but it's not going to be random loop boxes.
678000	682000	Now RumJumpStomp in our chat over at twitch.tv slash vognetwork says,
682000	686000	a lot of people are really angry about Rocket League removing crates
686000	689000	because of the effect it will have on the trading economy.
692000	695000	Oh, well, that's just, you know, it's for the great.
695000	698000	It's for the greater good that these things are gone.
698000	699000	Too bad for your economy.
699000	702000	I don't know, it's not a game I have really a stake in, so, yeah.
702000	705000	No, but I mean, if it was, let's, you know, this could be happening in any game.
705000	706000	You know what, it doesn't matter.
706000	709000	Whatever someone does, it's going to offend somebody.
709000	711000	So, what are you going to do?
711000	714000	Well, I think it's going to be interesting to see how this plays out from here.
714000	717000	I do think the trend of removing loop boxes,
717000	721000	I mean, you've seen Fortnite kind of do the more x-ray thing,
721000	723000	so it's like a different, it's not so much like the gambling mechanic
723000	724000	as it is you know what you're buying up front.
724000	727000	Like those types of like bundle packs and things of that nature,
727000	728000	they're never going to go away.
728000	730000	But I think the randomization,
730000	733000	the things that could even have that appearance of gambling,
733000	735000	you know, now that we know the odds and so forth,
735000	738000	I just feel like these things are going to take a downward trend overall.
738000	741000	Well, and with the Fortnite stuff, I mean, at least that,
741000	744000	with their like battle passes or whatever they call them,
744000	750000	you can, if you play the game enough or you can play it well enough,
750000	753000	you can actually earn enough credits to buy it with in-game money
753000	755000	each time and kind of keep that rolling.
755000	759000	So I think that's kind of cool that you can do that.
759000	760000	Yeah.
760000	763000	Don't know if they'll have something similar with Rocket League,
763000	764000	but we'll see.
764000	765000	We'll see, indeed.
765000	767000	Some other comments from chat.
767000	771000	Spyro Jonathan says, Loki is so right about that with CTR Nitro Fueled
771000	774000	and the microtransactions were not ever advertised to be in the game
774000	775000	when it was released.
775000	777000	That does kind of make it feel right.
777000	778000	Well, it's Activision though.
778000	781000	I mean, Modern Warfare, the game that they put out,
781000	784000	it's a remaster, let's throw some of that shit in there
784000	786000	because that's what people want.
786000	789000	They're just going to do it because they make money off of it
789000	791000	and you'll bitch and moan about it,
791000	793000	but in the end, people buy them and they make money off of it,
793000	794000	so they don't care.
794000	796000	Interesting comment from Questbuster.
796000	799000	Questbuster says, reminds me when Valve accidentally crashed
799000	803000	their Team Fortress 2 rare hat economy by accidentally making
803000	805000	certain ones drop like crazy with the patch.
805000	807000	Yeah, that was recently.
807000	809000	Yeah, and that is interesting when like, you know,
809000	813000	a bug or something happens there that kind of shoots the economy in the foot.
813000	814000	It's kind of interesting.
814000	818000	Well, that economy is also what's getting legislature.
818000	823000	You know, if you have random loot boxes and there's a monetary value
823000	826000	associated with that loot that you have,
828000	830000	that's a problem because that'd be gambling.
830000	833000	Kaijuto in chat says, Rocket League used to have a slot machine
833000	835000	like Roll when you opened a loot box.
835000	837000	They took it out like months ago, so they've been working on removing
837000	839000	the random loot stuff before this news.
839000	841000	Oh yeah, no, I don't think like this.
841000	843000	Yeah, it's more just kind of a coincidence in timing.
843000	847000	It's one of those timing things where I think together we see that loot boxes,
847000	852000	you know, it's changing drastically and it's, I think, in large part
852000	855000	because of, good job EA and Battlefront 2.
855000	858000	Like, if you can point at a reason and go,
858000	860000	that was the day that loot boxes died.
860000	866000	That game really started everybody getting pissed off at those.
866000	868000	EA is their own worst enemy.
868000	870000	Because when it was Mass Effect 3 and the type of thing they did there,
870000	874000	I remember the early days, that didn't seem so agitating, I think.
874000	877000	But I think that was because it really wasn't hard to earn enough
877000	879000	in-game currency to open your own loot boxes.
879000	882000	It was just that money was for the impatient, you know what I mean?
882000	885000	So, but then, you know, more companies realized,
885000	886000	oh, people will pay more money.
886000	888000	And then, oh, you're paying money on a $60 game.
888000	891000	Let's do more money on top of that to play as Darth Vader.
891000	893000	You know, so anyway.
893000	894000	Yeah.
894000	896000	All right. Well, let's move on.
896000	900000	We'll see what develops in the coming weeks with this whole loot box thing.
900000	903000	But this time next year, at least we're going to know all the odds on it.
903000	907000	I will say one game that, you know, I play a bit of is Overwatch.
907000	909000	And, you know, that game is a huge game on loot boxes.
909000	913000	Now, they're all cosmetics, so I think Blizzard usually tends to dodge
913000	917000	the bullets when it comes to this discussion in the industry about loot boxes
917000	922000	because, you know, the balance of Blizzard's game is not impacted by the loot boxes in it.
922000	925000	But it is going to be interesting to see a game of that caliber
925000	927000	because they said Blizzard was in on this, right?
927000	931000	So they're going to end up disclosing the percentage of, you know,
931000	933000	if you get a gold or a purple or what have you.
933000	934000	So it'd be very interesting.
934000	935000	Yeah.
935000	936000	All right. Anyway.
936000	938000	Well, let's move on and talk about our gaming weeks
938000	942000	and the types of video games or other games, as the case may be, I'll get into,
942000	944000	that we have been playing this week. So, Loki.
944000	948000	So I've been playing more Pokemon Go because the reason I haven't had my gotcha
948000	950000	for the few weeks is I couldn't find the charging cable for it
950000	954000	for like the longest time. And so I finally found it and it's charged
954000	955000	and now I'm wearing it.
955000	957000	So I've been playing a little bit of Pokemon Go
957000	960000	and I did one of the Team Rocket fights or whatever
960000	964000	and then I couldn't catch the piece of crap, you know, Charmander
964000	965000	or whatever they wanted me to catch after that.
965000	967000	So that was a little annoying.
968000	969000	What else?
970000	973000	I played a little bit of the Jurassic Park arcade game
973000	978000	because I was in arcade because we went to play more laser tag at yet another place.
978000	981000	So actually I went back to an old stomping ground that we used to go to,
981000	984000	Country Club Lanes, where they used to have 5th Mix back in the day
984000	986000	and we used to play it from like midnight to three in the morning.
987000	989000	Man, DDR 5th Mix was one of the best soundtracks.
989000	990000	It was great.
990000	992000	That techno remix of the Neverending Story.
992000	994000	Now that arcade is full of just the biggest,
994000	997000	just the same game to see at every goddamn arcade.
997000	1001000	So Jurassic Park, the ride, our Jurassic Park game they had there was pretty cool.
1001000	1003000	It was a little bit different of a cabinet because they have,
1003000	1005000	it actually, the seat moved when you're playing the game.
1005000	1007000	So it was a little bit more enhanced.
1007000	1010000	But it's just, it's such a, it's such a sign like,
1010000	1012000	what happened to all this?
1012000	1014000	Sorry, but speaking of dance games, quick tangent,
1014000	1016000	I'm sure you, I think I saw you post about that video.
1016000	1018000	So there was like a tournament at round one in the Bay Area.
1018000	1020000	Yes, the night motion.
1020000	1023000	Yeah, they did a dance rush stardom tournament
1023000	1025000	and that routine with the couple that was,
1025000	1026000	Awesome.
1026000	1029000	Darted Seer, somebody can you find that video and link it in our chat?
1029000	1031000	Cause I know you have to know what I'm talking about.
1031000	1032000	It's in my Twitter.
1032000	1033000	But there's, oh yeah, it's on your Twitter feed.
1033000	1034000	That's right.
1035000	1038000	But, um, that routine of that, that couple and what they were doing,
1038000	1040000	I get like, I don't totally understand.
1040000	1043000	Dance rush was so weird for me to say, cause I was, I used to love,
1043000	1045000	but I still do love Bawani. It has a place.
1045000	1048000	I would love to have one of those machines, but I would love to have one.
1048000	1051000	But like watching them do that routine, that was unreal.
1051000	1053000	That was amazing. Props to those guys.
1053000	1055000	I don't even know their names, but props to them.
1055000	1058000	That was certainly from Sacramento too. Shut up. Really? Yeah.
1058000	1061000	Should get them on the show. What the hell are we thinking?
1061000	1063000	Loki, what are we doing with our lives?
1063000	1065000	All right, no, we need to get them on the show at some point.
1065000	1067000	Open invite if you guys are out there. Yeah.
1067000	1068000	So yeah, that's cool.
1068000	1072000	So yeah. So, uh, now I have played at all of the laser tag places,
1072000	1075000	except for one in Elk Grove, um, that are in the Sacramento area.
1075000	1079000	And so we actually played laser X today because we had gone to that arcade
1079000	1082000	for so many times and laser X has been there since as long as I can remember.
1082000	1083000	Long time. Long time.
1083000	1086000	I think they've updated it since we were going there.
1086000	1090000	But, um, so I've actually played that system before at this other place
1090000	1094000	in Roseville, but they have, it's like slightly older. Um, it was okay.
1094000	1099000	I don't really like it too much. Um, so then we went back to the usual one.
1099000	1101000	We go to jazz tag and I played a game there.
1101000	1105000	I've just feels more like keys are to me. Whereas the, um,
1105000	1109000	the zone laser tech system, Helios one that they've got over there.
1109000	1114000	It's just, it's just all of it's very like kind of cheap feeling it.
1114000	1118000	The packs feel very cheap. The sound effects sound really shitty.
1118000	1121000	This the way that like, it doesn't seem very accurate.
1121000	1123000	It's just all of it feels really cheap,
1123000	1126000	but they just had an international tournament like in the Netherlands,
1126000	1130000	just not too long ago, like very recent for zone.
1130000	1134000	So it's very popular out there, but I don't know. Um, so yeah,
1134000	1138000	so that's pretty much is just laser tag and Pokemon go.
1138000	1142000	I'm working on game dev stuff cause I've been actually doing that this week.
1142000	1144000	All right. So my gaming week,
1144000	1147000	so I've been talking for several weeks about fakie survivor, right?
1147000	1150000	And the fake survivor game I've been playing with that started with 22
1150000	1154000	people. Um, so that survivor game was actually supposed to end tonight.
1154000	1155000	Tonight was supposed to be the last night.
1155000	1157000	It was going to be the final tribal council and all that stuff.
1157000	1159000	They couldn't do it tonight. You know why?
1159000	1163000	Cause I got too far in the game and I have this show as a commitment.
1163000	1166000	So they actually had to bump it to Monday night. I think one of the other,
1166000	1168000	one of the other girls that got really far also had some scheduling
1168000	1172000	problems. I can't really take all the credit. Um, but uh, yeah,
1172000	1176000	so they actually it's ending tomorrow. And um, so, you know, last,
1176000	1178000	I think the last update I gave you guys, I was in the final six, right? Yeah.
1178000	1180000	So a lot happened. Okay.
1180000	1183000	I found a hidden immunity idol and I knew it on the last episode,
1183000	1184000	but I couldn't say anything about it.
1184000	1187000	Cause I don't know who's watching played the hidden immunity idol at final
1187000	1190000	six erased three votes that were for me,
1190000	1194000	sent the other person home that got three votes on them during the immunity
1194000	1195000	challenge, which involved,
1195000	1199000	I had to have my camera on the floor because we had a water bottle in a sock
1199000	1203000	that we had to spin around a tower of solo cups and keep it going as long as
1203000	1205000	possible. I know it sounds ridiculous, but it's based on a real challenge.
1206000	1208000	Again, that was on the show. It's just using 99 cent clearance store props
1208000	1211000	instead of the stuff you'd see on CBS. So here's the hilarious thing.
1211000	1214000	So while the camera is on the floor and I'm doing this, um,
1214000	1216000	probably about 45 minutes into the challenge,
1216000	1220000	Mr. Smoosh comes in the room and Mr. Smoosh, I shit you not.
1220000	1224000	He walks into the frame and he like stares because he sees my phone.
1224000	1227000	I'm on Skype. He sees all the other people doing the challenge and he's like,
1227000	1230000	what's going on? What's going on? He walks right up to my phone,
1230000	1234000	knocks my phone on the ground and then the chaos knocks my tower over.
1234000	1236000	So Mr. Smoosh eliminated me from that final six challenge,
1236000	1239000	which is why I had to basically play the hidden immunity idol to save myself.
1239000	1245000	So anyway, um, yeah, that was Mr. Smoosh's little stardom this week.
1245000	1247000	So now he's doing this during OLR. He's like,
1247000	1250000	I want to be like dad and be on camera all the time. So that was that.
1250000	1255000	Anyway, um, long story short, the final immunity challenge was today.
1255000	1258000	I was still in it. Three people left,
1258000	1263000	did the final immunity challenge and I won the final immunity challenge
1263000	1265000	and I got to choose who to take to the final two.
1265000	1269000	So I am in the final two of the game and the final tribal councils tomorrow.
1269000	1272000	The hosts really want me to put it on my Twitter to see if some of you will
1272000	1274000	go watch because they want to recruit for next season.
1274000	1278000	So I will put it on Twitter so you guys can watch me win or lose.
1278000	1280000	Like I don't know what's going to happen, but I've had a lot of fun.
1280000	1284000	I met a lot of great people and had a real emotional roller coaster.
1284000	1285000	Like I'm not going to lie.
1285000	1288000	I lost it when I won that immunity challenge because it was something I
1288000	1291000	never expected to win because it was very physical in nature.
1291000	1293000	Do you guys want to see what I had to do? You ready to,
1293000	1296000	you want to see the final challenge? Here we go Twitch. All right.
1296000	1297000	So apologies to the podcasters.
1297000	1301000	I'm going to have Loki narrate what I'm doing and try to use my loud voice so
1301000	1303000	you can see what the final endurance challenge.
1303000	1305000	So if you ever watched the TV show,
1305000	1309000	you know that the final challenge and survivor is usually some sort of
1309000	1311000	endurance challenge. You ready? Okay, here we go.
1311000	1313000	So Loki, you got to narrate for the podcast.
1313000	1318000	All right. So, so he has a cup and then let's see,
1318000	1323000	was this like a shoelace? Yeah. So he's holding a tight shoelace.
1323000	1328000	So I got to do, how the hell did I do this? I think it was this. Yes.
1328000	1332000	Okay. And then I got to do, so he's wrapping around his fingers between his hands,
1332000	1335000	like the thumb and the pinky, right? All right. Thumb and pinky.
1335000	1337000	I did it the wrong way on one hand.
1337000	1339000	I hope the hosts are watching because I struck,
1339000	1344000	I struggled bust with this so hard when we were doing it. Okay.
1344000	1347000	So you have to make sure the inside is on like those three fingers.
1347000	1352000	You ready? Uh-huh. Middle finger, pull. Middle finger, pull. Cat's cradle.
1352000	1354000	All right. Cat's cradle. Okay.
1354000	1359000	So then you have to, oh shit, this is the wrong way.
1359000	1364000	Okay. Then you have to like. You have to grab this solo cup.
1364000	1368000	Oh, God damn it. I did what I did during the challenge. No.
1368000	1371000	Hold on, I'm going to try this one more time. I'm going to try this one more time.
1371000	1374000	This happened to me during the challenge when we were trying to set up.
1374000	1379000	Like I could not get it going and I know they were making fun of me.
1379000	1383000	Okay. So he's putting it back on his hands again.
1383000	1387000	Middle finger, middle finger. All right. Cat's cradle.
1387000	1391000	And he's going to grab the cup, which is upside down by wrapping it around it.
1391000	1395000	And he's got to hold the cup. So I have to hold it out like this. Out in front of him.
1395000	1400000	As long as possible. That's it. You hold this pose.
1400000	1405000	If the cup falls, you're out. So guess how long I went.
1405000	1406000	How many hours?
1406000	1407000	Nine hours.
1407000	1408000	Oh.
1408000	1413000	About, I don't have the final time, but I think I know we hit the 30 minute mark.
1413000	1417000	So I would say about 32 minutes. The first person was out after three minutes.
1417000	1423000	He just, the thing about that, like it's one of those things where it's like, it's, it's harder than it looks.
1423000	1426000	Because if you pull too tight or if you're too loose on that.
1426000	1427000	It's going to slip off.
1427000	1429000	It's going to slip off or it's going to fire out with a cannon.
1429000	1435000	And I think that's what happened to the girl who came in second is I think she adjusted.
1435000	1437000	Because I could see her doing all these yoga poses and things like that.
1437000	1439000	And I think when she was doing it, because it's hard.
1439000	1442000	My hands were freaking killed. My hands are still sore right now.
1442000	1446000	But I think she pulled too hard and the cup went shooting out.
1446000	1450000	So, and I think that's why. So, yeah.
1450000	1453000	And yeah, so that was, that was the challenge we had to do.
1453000	1458000	They're not all physical though. I know I've showed a lot of physical stuff on OLR, but some of them are like puzzles and things like that.
1458000	1461000	So it was, yeah, it's been, it's been interesting.
1461000	1463000	So next week we'll know if I actually won or not.
1463000	1469000	But I got down to the final two and I'm super considering I, I've played a handful of these games at this point.
1469000	1473000	And I usually flop them all, meaning I'm usually a pre-jury.
1473000	1475000	Like I'm just like super stoked that I've gotten as far as I have.
1475000	1477000	So there you go.
1477000	1478000	Let's see.
1478000	1480000	Looking in chat at some of the comments there.
1480000	1482000	So let's see.
1482000	1488000	Kaijuto in chat says, first survivor had Boston Rob, now they have OLR Rob.
1488000	1490000	Who knows? I don't, see, here's the thing.
1490000	1495000	Playing it from my home is so much easier because I actually get to still eat.
1495000	1497000	You don't want to see me when I'm hangry.
1497000	1499000	Like I was already emotional enough over this game.
1499000	1502000	I don't need to like starve myself to death on top of that.
1502000	1504000	That would be, that would be insane.
1504000	1506000	So anyway, there you go.
1506000	1511000	So that was, that was fakie survivor and we'll see what happens tomorrow.
1511000	1514000	But I did get to play some video games amongst that because as,
1514000	1518000	as the numbers were dwindling down, we sort of run out of things to talk about.
1518000	1520000	So I actually got to catch up on some other games.
1520000	1522000	I've been playing Overwatch randomly.
1522000	1527000	I just, I just started playing some matches and I wanted to see if the party system was in it yet,
1527000	1529000	or like the forced role thing was in it yet.
1529000	1533000	It's not, but I still just did some quick plays.
1533000	1537000	I got to finally do some more matches with Batiste because like he's not so new anymore.
1537000	1539000	So the newness of him has died down.
1539000	1542000	So I actually got to do some matches with him and Lucio.
1542000	1544000	And actually I had a great run as Lucio for some healing.
1544000	1545000	So that's, that's good.
1545000	1550000	Cause that's a character, excuse me, hiccups that Allen's really good with too.
1550000	1552000	So did some Lucio there as well.
1552000	1555000	And yeah, so I played some Overwatch and then I've been playing, of course,
1555000	1558000	a crap ton of Final Fantasy 14.
1558000	1560000	I'm still trying to catch up in the expansion.
1560000	1561000	I've made it a long way.
1561000	1566000	I've just completed the level 79 dungeon and trial.
1566000	1567000	Again, I don't want to ruin it.
1567000	1568000	So I want to tell you what it is.
1568000	1571000	It's a great throwback to Final Fantasy 1.
1571000	1572000	I'll say that much.
1572000	1574000	And if you've played the new expansion,
1574000	1578000	the level 79 dungeon is a direct reference to Final Fantasy 1.
1578000	1580000	Go back and look it up.
1580000	1582000	So that was pretty cool.
1582000	1584000	But yeah, so I, that's where I'm at.
1584000	1586000	So I'm almost to the end of the story, I think.
1586000	1587000	So that'll be good.
1587000	1589000	But the story, the story's kind of picked back up.
1589000	1592000	It lagged a little bit in the Amorang Zone around level 77,
1592000	1594000	but now it's really picked back up ever since I got out of there.
1594000	1597000	So I'm really enjoying the Shadowbringers expansion.
1597000	1598000	It's great.
1598000	1602000	So actdeft going back to Overwatch saying,
1602000	1604000	I'm waiting for Sigma to release officially.
1604000	1607000	The little I played of him on the PTR was fun.
1607000	1608000	Yeah, I want to check out Sigma as well,
1608000	1610000	although I haven't done the PTR yet.
1610000	1611000	Going back to Survivor,
1611000	1613000	SH-100Matt in chat says,
1613000	1614000	Nicely done, Rob.
1614000	1616000	Maybe you will come back on the All-Stars version.
1616000	1618000	You know, I've had to, like,
1618000	1620000	I have not streamed in six weeks,
1620000	1623000	and you can basically blame this game for that.
1623000	1624000	And I don't regret it.
1624000	1626000	I've met some wonderful people that I'll keep in touch with
1626000	1628000	long after this game is over and so forth.
1628000	1631000	But I don't know if I could do it again.
1631000	1633000	Like, it's a lot to put on hold.
1633000	1634000	And I know I always say that,
1634000	1636000	but here's the difference this time, guys.
1636000	1638000	Usually I get booted, like, in 14th place.
1638000	1640000	So I only spend a week and a half on the game,
1640000	1641000	and then whatever, it's done.
1641000	1643000	This time, I've gone the full length of the game.
1643000	1645000	I mean, win or lose tomorrow,
1645000	1646000	I went the entire length of the game.
1646000	1648000	It was like 51 days tomorrow.
1648000	1649000	It's 51 days.
1649000	1653000	So, you know, that's a long time to put everything else on hold.
1653000	1655000	But that's, like, Ingress has been on hold.
1655000	1658000	This has been, like, everything has been on hold.
1658000	1660000	So I don't know if I could do that again.
1660000	1663000	But I did say, if they do call me for All-Stars,
1663000	1666000	it's going to be hard to not answer the phone.
1666000	1669000	But the good news is, so they've already done an All-Stars.
1669000	1671000	This is the ninth season they have an All-Stars.
1671000	1673000	It's usually every seven.
1673000	1676000	So I have a good, like, five seasons to wait.
1676000	1678000	So it's going to be a while before I have to make that choice.
1678000	1680000	And that'll be very good, if they even call me.
1680000	1681000	But they may not.
1681000	1683000	There's been a lot of great people that have played the game.
1683000	1685000	So they may decide, I've had my run, I've had my story.
1685000	1686000	I don't come back.
1686000	1687000	But we'll see.
1687000	1690000	There's not a lot of guys over 30 that play these games.
1690000	1693000	So I feel a very unique void in that.
1693000	1694000	So, all right.
1694000	1696000	Anyway, enough about all that.
1696000	1699000	Let's get into some other housekeeping.
1699000	1701000	Oh, before we get to the gaming news,
1701000	1706000	I should give DragonCon a plug because DragonCon is coming up.
1706000	1708000	So some quick programming note.
1708000	1713000	We will be here live with Dark Sakura next week for episode 789.
1713000	1718000	790, the week after that, will be pre-taped.
1718000	1721000	We will be taping that without an audience in advance,
1721000	1723000	but we will be taking your questions.
1723000	1726000	It's going to be very much a listener-driven show with your questions.
1726000	1728000	We may try to do an interview or something during that week as well.
1728000	1731000	And Gamescom is going to happen that week.
1731000	1732000	So we'll be able to do that.
1732000	1733000	That'll be a lot of news, yeah.
1733000	1734000	Yeah, that'll be quite a bit going on.
1734000	1735000	So we're going to tape that without an audience.
1736000	1739000	And then that will premiere on Sunday night after the Bobby Blackwell show.
1739000	1741000	That is due to my travel.
1741000	1743000	I'm actually leaving a week early for DragonCon this year
1743000	1747000	to go spend time with Xtfer out in North Carolina where he lives now.
1747000	1749000	So I will be leaving the day before.
1749000	1752000	So 790 will not be live, but we hope you all will come out anyway.
1752000	1755000	And then it'll still be on the podcast feed and all that good stuff as well.
1755000	1757000	And you guys can certainly chat about it.
1757000	1760000	And I will go back and read the chat transcript afterwards because I do that.
1760000	1763000	And then there will be no show Labor Day Weekend
1763000	1766000	because DragonCon is going on.
1766000	1768000	And we will be back the week after Labor Day.
1768000	1770000	I think it's September 8th is the date.
1770000	1772000	We'll be back with episode 791 at that point.
1772000	1775000	So that's kind of how that is going to go.
1775000	1778000	Wow, episode 800 is going to be before the end of the year.
1778000	1779000	That's crazy, isn't it?
1779000	1780000	Yeah, anyway.
1780000	1786000	So, yeah, and Bobby will still be live that week that 790 is taped in advance.
1786000	1788000	Now, speaking of DragonCon,
1788000	1791000	the channel won't necessarily be dark during DragonCon
1791000	1796000	because we will be hosting the brand new DragonCon Twitch channel,
1796000	1798000	which, Bobby, I'm going to butcher this name.
1798000	1799000	I'm sorry, so correct me if I'm wrong.
1799000	1802000	I believe it's DC Media Track is their Twitch.
1802000	1804000	Bobby will correct me in chat if I'm wrong.
1804000	1808000	But we're going to be hosting their channel here at VOG
1808000	1811000	because some of the panels that Bobby, myself,
1811000	1815000	and some other folks you might know will actually be broadcast on that.
1815000	1818000	So even though there might not be an OLR that weekend or a Bobby that weekend,
1818000	1821000	you can actually tune in on Twitch and you'll be able to see some other stuff going on.
1821000	1822000	Thank you, Bobby.
1822000	1825000	It's DC Digital Media is the actual name of that channel.
1825000	1827000	So you can go give them a follow if you want.
1827000	1831000	I figured I probably should tell you what my DragonCon schedule is.
1831000	1834000	I think we're at the point where I can share that with you guys.
1834000	1836000	So you guys ready to hear about it?
1836000	1839000	Of course, now that I've said that, I lost my email.
1839000	1842000	So I need to bring it up again.
1842000	1844000	Help me buy time, Loki.
1845000	1849000	Mr. Smoosh is trying to put himself onto a potholder.
1849000	1851000	Okay, I got it. I got it. Sorry.
1851000	1854000	So here is my schedule for DragonCon this year.
1854000	1856000	So Friday at 1130.
1856000	1859000	This is in the room that I don't believe will be broadcast.
1859000	1860000	It's in Galleria 7.
1860000	1863000	But I'm going to be on a panel called Discussion or Discord?
1863000	1865000	What's wrong with peace, love, and understanding?
1865000	1868000	And that'll be talking about are we encouraging open discussion
1868000	1870000	or are we just eroding debates?
1870000	1873000	We're going to be talking a little bit about tough fandoms
1873000	1875000	and some of that real passion that goes into it.
1875000	1877000	Sometimes we get very passionate on this show.
1877000	1879000	So we'll talk a little bit about that.
1879000	1882000	Okay, thanks Bobby, saying that even the Galleria 7 stuff
1882000	1884000	will be recorded and posted later.
1884000	1885000	It just won't be live.
1885000	1887000	The stuff in Room 6 is going to be live.
1887000	1889000	This is a pretty big deal.
1889000	1892000	So that's my only panel on Friday, believe it or not.
1892000	1894000	No, the Tiger Claw.
1894000	1896000	The panel is called Discussion or Discord?
1896000	1898000	Not to be confused with the Discord app.
1898000	1899000	It has nothing to do with the Discord app.
1899000	1901000	It's talking about the actual meaning of Discord
1901000	1903000	where you disagree with people.
1903000	1904000	Good question.
1904000	1905000	Because we do love Discord,
1905000	1907000	but this panel has nothing to do with that.
1907000	1909000	That's my only panel on Friday.
1909000	1911000	So this one's a pretty big deal on Saturday.
1911000	1912000	You ready for this?
1912000	1914000	So Saturday at 1130 a.m.
1914000	1916000	at the Peachtree Ballroom at the Westin.
1916000	1918000	So it's a ballroom, this is a big panel.
1918000	1920000	I am fortunate enough to be moderating
1920000	1923000	Meet the Cast of World of Warcraft.
1923000	1925000	So I'm going to be moderating a panel with voice actors
1925000	1927000	including Dave Fennoy.
1928000	1931000	So he's done voices for Walking Dead and all that.
1931000	1933000	That's going to be amazing.
1933000	1936000	Dino Andrade, who I believe is friends with,
1936000	1937000	I follow him on Twitter.
1937000	1938000	He's friends with other people
1938000	1939000	that have been on the show before.
1939000	1942000	He does Professor Putricide,
1942000	1946000	and he does all the little gnomes and those voices.
1946000	1948000	He's very good at those voices.
1948000	1951000	Kimberly Brooks, also a very well-known voice actor,
1951000	1953000	is going to be on that panel as well.
1953000	1956000	I believe she is, I may be wrong.
1956000	1957000	I'm very, very sorry if I got this wrong.
1957000	1960000	I believe she's the new princess
1960000	1963000	of the Horde side in this expansion.
1963000	1964000	I'm so sorry if I'm incorrect,
1964000	1965000	but I believe that is it.
1965000	1970000	And then Quentin Flynn and Samantha Inouye-Hart.
1970000	1971000	And I'm so sorry if I butchered those names
1971000	1974000	because I haven't done my full research on that yet,
1974000	1977000	but you know I love World of Warcraft,
1977000	1979000	so I'm very excited to be doing that.
1979000	1981000	All right, Saturday at 2.30,
1981000	1983000	this was the VoG-submitted panel.
1983000	1985000	So Bobby and I are leading this one.
1985000	1987000	Video didn't kill the radio star.
1987000	1989000	Moving your audio podcast to video.
1989000	1991000	You know, we might know a thing or two about that, right?
1991000	1992000	I guess.
1992000	1994000	So we're going to be sharing some of the experiences
1994000	1996000	along with Bobby about moving to Twitch,
1996000	1997000	but you know what's really cool about that panel?
1997000	2000000	We have some other podcasters that have made that same move.
2000000	2003000	We have a representative from Twitch on that panel.
2003000	2004000	What?
2004000	2005000	Yeah, cool, right?
2005000	2007000	And that will be streamed.
2007000	2008000	That is in Galeria 6.
2008000	2011000	Tell them that you're streaming exclusively a mixer, though.
2011000	2014000	No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
2014000	2017000	All right, so not when there's a Twitch employee on the panel.
2017000	2019000	That is Saturday at 2.30 Eastern,
2019000	2022000	so you've got to subtract three for Pacific, okay?
2022000	2023000	Oh, is Run, Jump, Stomp on that panel, too?
2023000	2025000	I don't know his real names.
2025000	2026000	That's really cool.
2026000	2027000	All right, awesome.
2027000	2031000	All right, then I'm on a panel Saturday at 5.30.
2031000	2034000	This will be in Galeria 6, so it will be streamed.
2034000	2035000	Very cool.
2035000	2037000	I'm so honored to be a part of this.
2037000	2041000	Speaking Out, Podcasting Wall, LGBTQIA+.
2041000	2045000	So I get to be on the Rainbow panel Saturday at 5.30.
2045000	2046000	That is awesome.
2046000	2048000	There's going to be some great guests on that,
2048000	2050000	including is Nifty listening?
2050000	2051000	Nifty, you out there?
2051000	2052000	Guess who's on that panel?
2052000	2053000	You're going to be excited about this.
2053000	2054000	Dax!
2054000	2057000	From RuPaul's Drag Race Season 8 is on that panel.
2057000	2060000	So very excited about that.
2060000	2064000	Sunday at 10 a.m., so that's going to be very, very early,
2064000	2066000	but if you guys want to catch that, it'll be streamed, too.
2066000	2069000	I'm going to be on the Twitch 102 panel.
2069000	2072000	So last year I did 101.
2072000	2074000	This year I get to moderate 102.
2074000	2080000	A lot of feedback we got with 101 was that it was too much about the Ys,
2080000	2083000	and I think many people that attended were already streaming on Twitch
2083000	2085000	and wanted to know more about the technicals,
2085000	2087000	like the promoting your stream, the things like that.
2087000	2089000	So this panel's for y'all that asked for that.
2089000	2093000	So that will be Twitch 102.
2093000	2096000	That will be streamed Sunday at 10 a.m.
2096000	2100000	And then I believe my last panel, which will be in Galleria 7,
2100000	2103000	so it's not streamed but it's still an honor to be on this,
2103000	2106000	Sunday at 5.30, Twitch and other streaming.
2106000	2109000	So we are allowed to say the word mixer at that panel, Loki.
2109000	2111000	Twitch and other streaming, growing your audience.
2111000	2115000	So we talk about how to grow your audience and collaborate and work together.
2115000	2117000	So I'm excited to meet people.
2117000	2119000	I'm excited to be a part of it.
2119000	2122000	I'm so honored that digital media has included me.
2122000	2125000	I mean, I'm on six panels and five of them are digital media,
2125000	2128000	and I'm honored that the video game track had me back this year,
2128000	2132000	even if my schedule only allowed for the one panel, but it's what a panel.
2132000	2135000	Like, I mean, if I can only do one panel, to be doing World of Warcraft is...
2135000	2140000	Well, following up from last year where you did, was it the Mass Effect one?
2140000	2142000	I did, I did, and that was an honor as well.
2142000	2144000	I don't know if they, I think they are doing another Mass Effect panel.
2144000	2146000	They just, you know, they want to give somebody else the opportunity,
2146000	2148000	and I can't argue with that.
2148000	2150000	So that's great.
2150000	2152000	So I'm really looking forward to both of those tracks.
2152000	2155000	And yes, Nifty805 in chat says,
2155000	2158000	you are hashtag booked and blessed.
2158000	2160000	Yes, I am booked and blessed this year at DragonCon.
2160000	2162000	I'm very excited about it.
2162000	2164000	And yeah, hoping to see all the other events.
2164000	2167000	If you are planning on attending DragonCon and you'd like to meet up,
2167000	2171000	please join our Discord channel over at VOG Network.
2171000	2173000	That's vognetwork.com slash Discord.
2173000	2176000	We actually have a channel all about conventions,
2176000	2179000	and we will absolutely be using it for DragonCon this year.
2179000	2182000	Even if you can't be there, we'll be showing pictures and so forth.
2182000	2185000	I don't want to speak out a turn,
2185000	2190000	but I do believe if there is a way for Bobby and myself
2190000	2194000	to create some sort of video content for y'all at DragonCon,
2194000	2196000	outside of these panels, obviously,
2196000	2199000	and deliver it to you guys here on the channel,
2199000	2201000	you bet yourself we'll do that.
2201000	2202000	We're going to do that.
2202000	2205000	So I can't give you any details yet because we haven't hashed that out.
2205000	2208000	But I think it's safe to say we'll have something.
2208000	2209000	We'll do a little something-something.
2209000	2212000	And some of VOG Face's past and present will be there.
2212000	2214000	I know some of our friends from Voice Geek Network
2214000	2216000	that do other shows are planning on being there as well.
2216000	2219000	So I don't think we're going to have quite the large turnout from prior years,
2219000	2221000	but certainly like Travis Donovan.
2221000	2222000	I know it's going to be there.
2222000	2224000	Xtopher's very first DragonCon.
2224000	2227000	I'm excited to have him get to see all that
2227000	2229000	and give his impressions because he won't hold back.
2229000	2230000	So that'll be fun.
2230000	2232000	So we'll get to do a little guys-on-a-show reunion
2232000	2234000	while we're at DragonCon so that'll be fun.
2234000	2236000	So we're going to have a great year.
2236000	2238000	Labor Day weekend in Atlanta. It's going down.
2238000	2239000	I'm excited.
2239000	2241000	All right. Let's get into more video game news.
2241000	2243000	So Loki, why don't you start us off?
2243000	2244000	So this one's interesting.
2244000	2248000	So apparently Take-Two has sent some private investigators
2248000	2252000	to a YouTuber's house to kind of crack down on some leaks.
2252000	2256000	So this was a guy by the name of Supmato.
2256000	2260000	He was posting different leaked information about Borderlands 3.
2260000	2265000	And the way he came across some of this stuff was
2265000	2272000	Take-Two were working on the Twitch integration for Borderlands 3.
2272000	2276000	And so there was a trailer that came out talking about some of that.
2276000	2280000	And in the trailer, they goofed and showed the username
2280000	2283000	of one of the Twitch accounts that's tied to it.
2283000	2286000	And lo and behold, it was a legit Twitch account.
2286000	2287000	These people subscribed to it.
2287000	2291000	They saw other Twitch accounts that had these really weird names attached to that.
2291000	2295000	And so they were, whereas the accounts were streamed privately,
2295000	2300000	they could take the mobile app and it would show kind of a screenshot
2300000	2303000	of what was streaming on that channel, keep refreshing,
2303000	2307000	and then eventually get screenshots of stuff that they haven't announced things for,
2307000	2309000	like skill trees and whatnot.
2309000	2313000	And so he was able to leak stuff out based on that.
2313000	2317000	They've also DMCA'd, striked his channel 63 times for different videos.
2317000	2319000	Well, hold on. Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
2319000	2324000	These were like private Twitch streams that maybe employees were using to stream to each other.
2324000	2326000	But the way the Twitch app works, though.
2326000	2328000	Right. You can still see the thumbnails.
2328000	2330000	So how is that this guy's fault?
2330000	2333000	They're the ones that broadcast it on Twitch.
2333000	2337000	Because they're saying that, well, he also had a private Discord
2337000	2341000	that he charged money to Patreon subscribers to get access to.
2341000	2342000	Okay, yeah.
2342000	2346000	And so they're saying that they're selling their copyrighted works.
2346000	2350000	That's where it gets dicey when you get a little too...
2350000	2352000	I don't know what the word... I don't want to say greedy.
2352000	2353000	Greedy is the wrong word.
2353000	2356000	But when you get a little too like, you know,
2356000	2359000	there's just too much of that overeagerness type of thing
2359000	2362000	to like be the first to be the one breaking news that it's like,
2362000	2363000	let's make a little coin off it.
2363000	2366000	But now it's getting dicey because you're making coin off it no matter how much.
2366000	2367000	So, yeah.
2367000	2368000	But he also...
2368000	2369000	That makes sense.
2369000	2372000	He also was leaking some other stuff prior to this whole Twitch thing as well.
2372000	2376000	So, he may have had, you know, communications with different insider employees or whatever.
2376000	2381000	But this was basically his shtick and what happened.
2381000	2383000	But he was kind of surprised to see that, you know,
2383000	2385000	there were some private investigators that actually came to his house
2385000	2387000	and started questioning about stuff,
2387000	2391000	which is kind of an interesting move on Take-Two's part.
2391000	2393000	Overzealous, says ActDeaf, is the word.
2393000	2394000	Yes, it is.
2394000	2395000	Wow. Thank you.
2395000	2398000	And he's an English teacher in Mexico.
2398000	2400000	So, of course, he thinks of the word before I do.
2400000	2401000	Thank you. Yes.
2401000	2402000	That is a good word for it.
2402000	2404000	SG100Matt says, stuck your hand in the cookie jar too much.
2404000	2406000	That's another way to put it, for sure.
2406000	2407000	Yeah.
2407000	2414000	So, of course, you know, he put out a video talking about the situation was happening.
2414000	2417000	2K Games put out a statement saying, you know,
2417000	2420000	that the information that's out there is untrue and incomplete.
2420000	2422000	And so there's some more stuff.
2422000	2424000	But in the end, Take-Two's a big company.
2424000	2428000	They have enough money to sue him into oblivion or at least, you know,
2428000	2429000	strong arm him that way.
2429000	2432000	So, it's going to happen.
2432000	2434000	But now the information is out there.
2434000	2436000	You can't stop the spread of information.
2436000	2437000	This is true, yes.
2437000	2439000	So, I mean, maybe some things that they had planned to save for Gamescom
2439000	2443000	or some other types of announcements are surely out there now.
2443000	2445000	So, I mean, it does kind of take the wind out of those sails.
2445000	2452000	But, yeah, I mean, that's just the nature of, like, the, I don't know, journeys.
2452000	2456000	Well, maybe be careful when you're posting your, you know, streaming video with IDs in there.
2456000	2457000	That's part of it.
2457000	2459000	But, yeah, you got to be careful with that stuff.
2459000	2460000	Don't they have people that review those things?
2460000	2461000	You would think.
2461000	2464000	But it also just goes to show, like, you know, just how, you know,
2464000	2469000	foaming at the mouth people are about, you know, any little piece of information.
2469000	2471000	I mean, look at YouTube culture.
2471000	2474000	People will make, and Twitch, or any streaming, really, culture,
2474000	2476000	Twitch, Mixer, whoever you want to say.
2476000	2480000	But YouTube, I would feel like, especially, people will make five-minute videos
2480000	2484000	out of, like, hey, some guy posted a Reddit, a thing on Reddit about this.
2484000	2485000	And let's look into this.
2485000	2488000	So, you know, that's just, like, you take that one little bit of information,
2488000	2493000	and it's, like, you just, like, people make all this content about it.
2493000	2494000	Yeah.
2494000	2495000	You know, it's crazy.
2495000	2499000	And I know that I fully see the irony in that when we're doing a show like this.
2499000	2502000	But I like to think we talk about more than one thing on this show.
2502000	2503000	You know what I mean?
2503000	2504000	Yeah.
2504000	2505000	So, yeah.
2505000	2507000	So, anyway, people going crazy for Borderlands 3 information.
2507000	2508000	Yeah.
2508000	2509000	When's the game come out?
2509000	2510000	September.
2510000	2511000	Yeah, okay.
2511000	2512000	Well, it's only a month away.
2512000	2513000	It's, like, a few weeks away.
2513000	2514000	Yeah, it really is.
2514000	2517000	Now, Dartitsuya in chat says, the dissection videos.
2517000	2519000	I do enjoy some of those.
2519000	2521000	Yeah, I'm not knocking them and saying they're all bad.
2521000	2523000	I'm just saying that's, like, part of the culture,
2523000	2525000	is that when one little piece of information leaks out,
2525000	2528000	it's, like, all these, you know, information.
2528000	2532000	Like, I remember Shane would show me, not so much for this round of Pokémon,
2532000	2535000	but the last round of Pokémon when, like, X and Y were the new games,
2535000	2538000	or, I'm sorry, Sun and Moon were the new games.
2538000	2540000	Like, there would be the littlest little trailer,
2540000	2542000	like, two-minute trailer that Nintendo would put out,
2542000	2543000	a little mini-direct or something.
2543000	2545000	And then it's, like, the 90-minute discussion video.
2545000	2546000	Yeah.
2546000	2547000	It goes on.
2547000	2549000	Because this was back when we were doing, like, Pokéstop podcasts regularly,
2549000	2551000	and I was always, like, dang, how do people do, like,
2551000	2553000	90-minute videos off, like, a two-minute...
2553000	2555000	I think you'd be surprised.
2555000	2557000	They were bad videos by any means.
2557000	2559000	They were definitely, like, enthusiastic fans,
2559000	2563000	really getting down and dirty on all this content.
2563000	2565000	So this is very, very interesting.
2565000	2567000	So, anyway, moving on.
2567000	2571000	So something that you can't really dissect anymore because it's gone.
2572000	2577000	It has to do with DuckTales and DuckTales Remastered.
2577000	2579000	DuckTales Remastered specifically.
2579000	2581000	No longer available for purchase.
2581000	2584000	If you thought that game would be around forever, it is not.
2584000	2585000	At least digitally.
2585000	2588000	Now, you know, there's physical copies out there in the world,
2588000	2591000	and, you know, they'll always be out there on secondhand markets,
2591000	2594000	flea markets, garage sales, places like that.
2594000	2597000	But I do think because so many people got this game digitally,
2597000	2600000	and now that option has been pulled,
2600000	2602000	you can no longer get this game digitally.
2602000	2604000	You can still redownload it if you purchased it before,
2604000	2605000	so don't freak out.
2605000	2607000	But, I mean, there's even going to come a day,
2607000	2609000	just like they pulled down the Wii shop eventually.
2609000	2611000	There's going to come a day when the Wii U shop,
2611000	2613000	if you bought it there like I did, goes down,
2613000	2616000	so you won't be able to redownload it, or, you know, whatever the case.
2616000	2620000	Well, I bought it on Steam because they had it down for $3.74,
2620000	2621000	so I was like, yeah.
2621000	2624000	They had a huge sale, and I wish we could have got this out there
2624000	2627000	before it got delisted, but they only gave us, like, three days notice.
2627000	2628000	Yeah.
2628000	2629000	It was out, and then it was gone.
2629000	2632000	August 8th was the day it was delisted, so it is gone.
2632000	2636000	No more can you get this game on Steam or PS3 or Xbox 360.
2636000	2638000	It was backwards compatible on Xbox One, though,
2638000	2641000	so I wish I did have it.
2641000	2645000	I think they gave it away for PlayStation games at one point,
2645000	2647000	so I think I have it on PS3.
2647000	2648000	Yeah, I do sort of remember that.
2648000	2651000	And I have it on Wii U, but I don't think I ever got it on Xbox.
2651000	2653000	I would love to get a physical copy for Xbox, though,
2653000	2655000	and then that way you could play it on Xbox One,
2655000	2657000	because it was a good game.
2657000	2661000	The original DuckTales game is one of the greatest NES games they ever did, really.
2661000	2663000	Yeah, and the remaster is pretty good, too, from right here.
2663000	2665000	Yeah, and the remaster was pretty faithful.
2665000	2668000	It added little bits at the beginning and end,
2668000	2670000	but they did a really good job with it.
2670000	2673000	And the vert soundtrack is really, really good
2673000	2676000	with all the reimaginings of the songs.
2676000	2681000	So, yeah, they had it down to 374 until it was gone forever,
2681000	2684000	but the physical version might still be a way to find it,
2684000	2686000	but I imagine the price of that physical version
2686000	2690000	as people realize it's going to have a little bit of rarity to it now,
2690000	2693000	the price of that might go up. We'll see.
2693000	2697000	Now, Bob Coffee says you can still find physical copies for PlayStation 3
2697000	2700000	at Walmart for $12.88 pretty easily.
2700000	2704000	Bob Coffee also pointing out, though, that these are showing up on eBay
2704000	2706000	for 40 bucks already.
2706000	2710000	So you might have to wait a little bit for things to kind of even out a bit.
2710000	2712000	Just go buy used copies somewhere.
2712000	2715000	Oh, for sure. Well, even the used copies are probably, you know,
2715000	2717000	I don't know what it currently runs out on GameStop,
2717000	2719000	and now your computer's dead, so you can't look it up for me.
2719000	2720000	I have a phone.
2720000	2723000	No, it's fine. I'm sure somebody can look it up, too.
2723000	2726000	Also, D'Artecia points out that was the last performance
2726000	2728000	of Alan Young's Scrooge.
2728000	2732000	And, you know, it was great that he still did the voice acting.
2732000	2736000	You could tell he was a little older, and his voice was a little more,
2736000	2739000	you know, at a very mature stage, you know, when he was doing it.
2739000	2741000	I mean, he did a great job, don't get me wrong,
2741000	2743000	but you could definitely tell it was, you know,
2743000	2746000	he was getting to that point where he's very, getting older,
2746000	2750000	and, you know, probably harder for him to do, very hard work.
2750000	2752000	Because who does the voice now? Doesn't David Tennant do the voice
2752000	2754000	of Uncle Scrooge now in the new?
2754000	2755000	Yes, I think so.
2755000	2756000	Yeah.
2756000	2758000	So let's say, D'Artecia says,
2758000	2761000	I want to say there was another actress that passed away from that game.
2761000	2764000	I forget. Wasn't it, I hope I don't butcher the name, June Ferre.
2764000	2765000	Wasn't it Magic of the Spell?
2765000	2766000	Yes, it was Magic of the Spell.
2766000	2768000	I don't remember who that actress is.
2768000	2769000	It's June Ferre, isn't it?
2769000	2770000	I'm almost positive.
2770000	2772000	Somebody look that up for me, because I think I'm right.
2772000	2775000	Now Bobby Black Wolf talking about the price equalization saying,
2775000	2777000	just wait a little bit.
2777000	2781000	Final Fantasy 13 on Xbox 360 shot up on the used market
2781000	2783000	when the Xbox One backwards compatible version came out,
2783000	2787000	but after a few months, it was back down to a more reasonable price.
2787000	2788000	Yeah, absolutely.
2788000	2790000	D'Artecia does think I got that right.
2790000	2793000	Yeah, June Ferre was in like her 80s or 90s when that came out.
2793000	2799000	So, you know, I believe, I want to look up her Wikipedia article
2799000	2801000	because I don't want to say she passed and then be wrong.
2801000	2803000	Because that's like the most horrible thing you can do.
2803000	2805000	She passed on the other project.
2805000	2807000	Yes, that's right. She passed on to other projects.
2807000	2809000	Let's double check here.
2809000	2810000	I'm getting the bit.
2810000	2814000	Okay, she did pass away in 2017 at 99 years old.
2814000	2815000	Bless her heart.
2815000	2816000	That's a long way.
2816000	2818000	That's a long, big life.
2818000	2822000	So, yes, June Ferre did pass away and she was looking up.
2822000	2825000	I'm just confirming in her filmography.
2825000	2826000	There's radio.
2826000	2827000	Where's TV?
2827000	2828000	Where's DuckTales?
2828000	2829000	It's got to be in the 80s.
2829000	2830000	Where's DuckTales?
2830000	2832000	It's got to be in the 80s somewhere, right?
2832000	2834000	She was on the Smurfs.
2834000	2835000	She was Jokey Smurf.
2835000	2837000	I never realized that.
2837000	2839000	So, she was on the Gummy Bears, too.
2839000	2840000	Good lord.
2840000	2841000	Yep, she was Magic and a Spell.
2841000	2843000	There it is, DuckTales 87 to 90.
2843000	2845000	So, it's June Ferre.
2845000	2847000	I'm glad I remembered that, actually.
2847000	2848000	I'm proud of me.
2848000	2851000	All right, let's move on.
2851000	2853000	Some news about Rockstar, right, Loki?
2853000	2862000	Yeah, so you may know game testers have been kind of getting the brunt of the firings
2862000	2865000	when game development ends on certain games.
2865000	2869000	But now, though, that may be changing a little bit with Rockstar
2869000	2873000	because Rockstar is actually converting their game testers now to full-time,
2873000	2874000	which is pretty awesome.
2874000	2879000	So, they're basically now making it full-time positions
2879000	2882000	so that testers don't have to worry.
2882000	2885000	Once their contract is up, are they getting fired?
2885000	2887000	What's their next job going to be?
2887000	2890000	Now, there's a little bit more stability in that sense, which is kind of nice.
2892000	2896000	And apparently, this has gone into effect as of the beginning of this month.
2896000	2901000	And they didn't say how many people this is affecting
2901000	2905000	or whether it extends to the temporary workers that they had before.
2905000	2907000	But it is something that's positive, at least.
2908000	2912000	Yeah, they said a large number of staff are enrolling temporary contracts
2912000	2917000	and live in the hope that they will be extended and be able to pay rent
2917000	2921000	as the end of their contract approaches.
2921000	2926000	I don't feel anyone is uncomfortable speaking out
2926000	2930000	in the hopes that they can extend long enough to be permanent.
2930000	2934000	Staff are often reminded how lucky they are simply working for Rockstar.
2934000	2935000	Yeah, which is unfortunate.
2935000	2937000	They kind of rub that in their face like,
2937000	2941000	well, you're lucky to have this job even though it's shitty or whatever.
2941000	2943000	So, it is nice that they're extending that out
2943000	2945000	and hopefully paying them better with that.
2946000	2949000	Maybe other companies can take note of that.
2949000	2951000	It's nice to hear a little bit of good news
2951000	2953000	about the way people are treated in the industry
2953000	2956000	because taking them on as full-time and not just being tapped
2956000	2957000	means they get the benefits.
2957000	2959000	There's a lot of other perks that come with that.
2959000	2962000	Just think of the extra money that you would have, Rockstar, in Take-Two.
2962000	2965000	If you stop sending private investigators to YouTuber's houses.
2966000	2968000	Wow. All right.
2968000	2970000	Let's move on and talk about Gamescom.
2970000	2972000	It's coming up very soon.
2972000	2974000	So, those of you maybe over in Europe,
2974000	2977000	if you're going to be near Germany, maybe Cologne specifically,
2977000	2980000	you might head on over to Gamescom.
2980000	2985000	So, Jeff Keeley is actually going to be doing a big press conference
2985000	2988000	called Gamescom Opening Night Live
2988000	2991000	because there hasn't really been a big press conference.
2991000	2993000	Microsoft and Sony used to do them.
2993000	2997000	PT, the epic playable trailer for the Silent Hill game that never was,
2997000	3000000	that was a Gamescom thing that came out of Gamescom.
3000000	3002000	I thought it wasn't Tokyo Game Show or anything.
3002000	3004000	No, I'm pretty sure it was Gamescom. Yeah.
3004000	3008000	They even cite that in this story that PT was part of that.
3008000	3009000	PT2.
3009000	3010000	Well, yeah.
3010000	3014000	But anyway, Jeff Keeley is going to be putting together a press conference in Cologne
3014000	3019000	and of course, Jeff Keeley does the game awards.
3019000	3021000	So, he's used to putting on these big event shows.
3021000	3028000	Gamescom Opening Night Live will be Monday, August 19th at 11 a.m. Pacific
3028000	3030000	because of the weird time zone difference.
3030000	3033000	It's actually at 8 p.m. over there.
3033000	3035000	But because they are that far ahead,
3035000	3040000	it's going to be 11 a.m. for us here in the Pacific coast of the U.S.
3040000	3045000	So, Hideo Kojima is going to be there to present yet another look at Death Stranding.
3045000	3047000	We're getting close. I'm okay with it.
3047000	3049000	Is it coming out this year or is that next year? It's next year.
3049000	3051000	I think it's next year.
3051000	3052000	I think it's next year.
3052000	3055000	Some more publishers that we'll be showing.
3055000	3057000	There's a lot of people here.
3057000	3058000	2K Games.
3058000	3059000	Oh, no. Sorry.
3059000	3060000	Act Def corrects us and says it is this year.
3060000	3062000	November is when it is out.
3062000	3063000	So, there you go.
3063000	3067000	Anyways, some of the other companies that will be showing up at Opening Night Live.
3067000	3074000	2K Games, Activision, Bandai Namco, Bungie, Capcom, EA, Epic Games, Google Stadia,
3074000	3081000	Deep Silver, Private Division, Sega, Squeenix, Sony, THQ Nordic, Ubisoft, and Xbox Game Studios.
3081000	3082000	That's a lot.
3082000	3084000	That's a lot of the big players.
3084000	3087000	That's pretty much everybody you'd expect to do some things at E3.
3087000	3089000	So, yeah, that'll be cool.
3089000	3094000	Dark Tetsuya thinks it could be Need for Speed related news coming from EA.
3094000	3095000	That would be exciting.
3095000	3096000	We'll be into that.
3096000	3098000	Yeah, I heard that they're doing a new one.
3098000	3102000	And they also have a new IP for Plants vs. Zombies.
3103000	3104000	That's right.
3104000	3107000	Speaking of new IPs, or, well, this could be recycled.
3107000	3108000	Who knows?
3108000	3115000	But apparently Sega is getting ready to reveal a AAA game at Gamescom.
3115000	3116000	Hmm.
3116000	3120000	So, yeah, Sega is teasing an all-new AAA game.
3120000	3123000	They send an email out to various blogs and so forth.
3123000	3131000	Sega will also be showing off Catherine Full Body, Two Point Hospital, the Sega Genesis Mega Drive Mini, and so forth.
3131000	3134000	But, yeah, the fact that it's AAA, that's interesting.
3134000	3137000	Could it be a new Sonic game?
3137000	3140000	Could it be a new PC related?
3140000	3141000	I mean, we don't know.
3141000	3144000	We already know about Phantasy Star Online 2, so I don't think it's that.
3144000	3147000	Unless, oh shit, if they made, like, a new mainline Phantasy Star game.
3147000	3150000	Could you imagine, like, after all these years, Phantasy Star 5?
3150000	3152000	I would be, I'd cry.
3152000	3155000	That would be amazing if they did, like, a Phantasy Star 5.
3156000	3161000	Or even just, like, a single player type of game, you know, set in, like, PSO or PSUs.
3161000	3165000	Like, what was that game on PS Vita, or was it PSP?
3165000	3169000	Like, it was just, like, Phantasy Star Universe, but, like, a single player campaign.
3169000	3170000	I'd love something like that.
3170000	3173000	I would just love another Daytona game.
3173000	3174000	Huh?
3174000	3175000	Yeah.
3175000	3176000	Doo doo doo doo doo doo.
3176000	3177000	That's all they have to do.
3177000	3178000	Just play that.
3178000	3179000	Just play that.
3180000	3185000	And just as silly, you know, to be really silly, they could have Kazurai come on stage and go,
3185000	3187000	It's Daytona!
3188000	3189000	Daytona!
3189000	3191000	Kazurai's busy being retired at this point.
3191000	3192000	Oh, come on.
3192000	3193000	All right.
3193000	3196000	Questbuster's saying Nintendo will be a game's commifier call correctly.
3196000	3200000	Luigi's Mansion 3, Sword and Shield, The Witcher 3 port will be there among others.
3200000	3201000	Yeah, that's true.
3202000	3204000	S.G. 100 Matt says, Don't over-hype us.
3204000	3208000	If you over-hype it for us and then tell us it's two years away, you're hurting your own game.
3209000	3210000	So, we'll see.
3210000	3211000	It sounds like Sega could be ready to release.
3211000	3213000	It's Shenmue 4.
3213000	3214000	Shenmue 4.
3215000	3216000	And please kickstart it for us.
3216000	3217000	Anything is possible.
3217000	3218000	Who knows?
3218000	3221000	Support our Patreon and it will develop Shenmue 4.
3221000	3222000	Who knows?
3222000	3223000	More news, Loki, right?
3223000	3226000	Yeah, so No Man's Sky Beyond is coming out.
3226000	3228000	I feel like we've talked about it for the past three weeks.
3228000	3229000	It's coming.
3229000	3230000	It's coming.
3230000	3231000	It's coming.
3231000	3232000	But they tease us a little more every time, right?
3232000	3233000	Yeah.
3233000	3235000	So now it's finally coming out this week, though.
3235000	3241000	Dude, Alan, when he wasn't playing, he was playing the Black Mesa, the Half-Life redo,
3241000	3242000	right?
3242000	3243000	He played that.
3243000	3245000	I think he finished that, and now he's back on No Man's Sky.
3245000	3246000	Like, he plays it a lot.
3246000	3249000	I almost want to re-buy it on PC, just so I can play with him.
3249000	3255000	I'm with you there, because I was just about to say, so there's a brand new trailer that
3255000	3260000	got released, and they set it to the same music as the original trailer, and oh my god,
3260000	3263000	it looks, this is like what it should have been when it launched.
3263000	3265000	This is like the hype that they had before.
3265000	3267000	So 16 to 32 players.
3267000	3270000	They're going to add VR support, the Nexus social space.
3270000	3273000	You can tame creatures in there.
3273000	3275000	You can ride them as well.
3275000	3277000	They also put milking in there.
3277000	3280000	I don't know if you really need to get blue milk out of those things.
3280000	3288000	Multiplayer missions, cooking and crafting recipes, better aliens, power and logic and
3288000	3292000	industrial bases, and lots more.
3292000	3296000	And that looked awesome, based on the trailer that they had.
3296000	3300000	Yeah, I was going to say, I was interested in getting it on PC so I could play with Alan,
3300000	3305000	but I am just too intrigued by the VR part of it.
3305000	3308000	Like, the fact that it's going to be playable on PlayStation VR.
3308000	3310000	And Oculus, too.
3310000	3311000	Oh yeah, for sure.
3311000	3312000	Yeah, sure.
3312000	3315000	So if you are on PC, I mean, you're going to have that, but I don't have those.
3315000	3316000	I have PSVR.
3316000	3317000	Yeah.
3317000	3320000	And they said the VR is really good in it, too.
3320000	3324000	Oh, I'm getting chills just thinking about, like, I hope I can find my disc.
3324000	3326000	That's the other thing I'm worried about.
3326000	3327000	So there's that.
3327000	3331000	And then here's another cool thing, though, that is something that they're interested in doing.
3331000	3333000	They want to bring it to the Switch.
3333000	3337000	So that's something else that they're looking into right now, is how can we port this to the Switch?
3337000	3345000	Because, you know, obviously the Switch is much less powerful than, say, a PlayStation 4 or PC.
3345000	3348000	But it is something that they're interested in.
3348000	3350000	And, you know, it's super interesting.
3350000	3351000	I love the Switch.
3351000	3354000	We're obviously very focused on what we're doing right now.
3354000	3360000	We have done a lot of work for PSVR to optimize the game, so I'd be interested to see what's possible.
3360000	3364000	But at the moment, we're just very focused on what we're doing right now.
3364000	3369000	So it is something that he's interested in, but we'll see.
3369000	3374000	It might be a while before that actually happens, if it even is able to happen.
3374000	3380000	It's just so crazy how much they've really been dedicating themselves to working on this game.
3380000	3389000	And whether it was something they were always going to do, or they felt a sense of obligation after the first release was not so well received.
3389000	3392000	But as we know, they've really made up a lot of ground within the industry.
3392000	3394000	We had that story a few months ago.
3394000	3395000	I think they've redeemed themselves.
3395000	3396000	For sure.
3396000	3403000	It's right up there with Final Fantasy XIV's rebirth, with Diablo III removing the Auction House and fixing the entire freaking game.
3403000	3405000	What they've done with No Man's Sky is right up there.
3405000	3406000	I think it's going to be pretty incredible.
3406000	3414000	I think if the trailer reflects actually what the game is, because remember, that was the issue with the original trailer.
3414000	3415000	True.
3415000	3416000	But I think they've gotten better now.
3416000	3423000	Even just watching Alan play, and Alan has a lot of parts from my old computer, so he's not even running the newest stuff.
3423000	3427000	And just looking over his shoulder, watching him play on PC, I'm always like,
3427000	3429000	Dang, this game is so pretty.
3429000	3434000	Some of the areas that he's in, I'm like, dang, I never really found a place like that on PlayStation.
3434000	3437000	And it's just so mesmerizing to watch.
3437000	3439000	It'll be fun. Multiplayer will be fun now.
3439000	3444000	Yeah, I'm excited for the fans of this game that have been waiting for this for so long.
3444000	3448000	And I'm excited for people like me that were casuals.
3448000	3452000	I haven't played it in a very long time since any of the expansions have come out.
3452000	3458000	Even when they did with the Stargates and stuff, I remember Bobby and I did some streams on Twitch, and we had a good time.
3458000	3463000	We built star bases so we could find each other, the little Stargates so we could connect, and that was really cool.
3463000	3470000	So the fact that that's going to get taken even further now with these larger squads, and you put VR on top of that.
3470000	3478000	The only thing I'm worried about is when I played VR Skyrim, it's beautiful, it's great, it really is immersive.
3478000	3483000	I could only do it for so long before I just started to feel a certain way.
3483000	3488000	And that's just the way I'm wired, the way my brain is, and my health and everything.
3488000	3497000	It's just that after an hour or so, I have to really take it off and be like, I have to disconnect from VR because it's too much.
3497000	3501000	It starts to have a physical effect on me that I don't like.
3501000	3507000	So that's the only thing I'm worried about a little bit with this, but for the most part, I'm very excited about it.
3507000	3513000	Looking in chat, ActDef says, if it does come to the Switch, cross-platform multiplayer, please.
3513000	3515000	Oh, wouldn't that be great if it wasn't cross-platform?
3515000	3517000	Well, does it even have cross-platform between PC and PlayStation 4?
3517000	3524000	They don't because, and I think there's a reason for it, because when the game first launched, we weren't talking about cross-platform and all that yet.
3524000	3528000	It was just kind of an accepted thing that PC and PS4 would be separate.
3528000	3536000	Well, I think the problem is now, at this point, probably why they can't fuse them together, is that basically you have one universe on PC.
3536000	3541000	Where things have been named and everything's got their thing, and you have another universe on PS4 that's kind of the same thing.
3541000	3549000	I don't know if they can just combine them, because what happens if you've got a planet over here and a planet over here, and you don't know what's been built on one versus the other.
3549000	3555000	So I don't know if they will be able to successfully bridge that gap without pissing somebody off.
3555000	3562000	But you would think, couldn't they just take all buildings, like in the entire universe, what would be the odds?
3562000	3573000	But you know what would happen to somebody, there'd be that Kotaku story, like the merge of the worlds has caused one person's base to be squashed by another person.
3573000	3578000	There'd be that thing, but I would think there'd be a way to work it out somehow, you never know.
3578000	3581000	Dartusuya says, I could get into No Man's Sky on Switch.
3581000	3586000	Run Jump Stomp in chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network says, probably Sony getting in the way.
3587000	3597000	Well, you know, Sony had to back off a little bit because they were really painted out to be the bad guy in a lot of the talk about Rocket League and what was the big one?
3597000	3607000	Oh, Fortnite. Fortnite was the big one that I think really made PlayStation have to kind of, because it was all the people trying to get their Epic accounts on Switch and they couldn't do it because they had it on PS4.
3607000	3613000	And like all their stuff was getting locked out and that made Sony look like really bad. That was a very bad PR thing for Sony.
3613000	3619000	So I think Sony has kind of been forced, pressured by the gamers out there to go back on that a little bit.
3619000	3622000	And you know, for the most part, they have at this point.
3622000	3627000	So, um, Run Jump Stomp says, they weren't painted to be the bad guy, they were the bad guy.
3627000	3632000	You know why I give, here's why I give them just a little shred, a little shred of credit.
3632000	3635000	Remember guys, I'm a big Final Fantasy XIV player.
3635000	3642000	That game has always been cross platform between Sony, PlayStation 4, and PC.
3642000	3645000	So like I've been playing a game for years that is cross platform.
3645000	3648000	I'm surprised that hasn't come to Xbox One yet.
3648000	3657000	I'm surprised too amongst all of this that I, that was one of my predictions for E3 was that they would announce that Shadowbringers would be out on Xbox One as well.
3657000	3662000	I am also surprised. I can understand maybe why they don't want to do the Switch because you know the reality is-
3662000	3663000	Well that makes sense, yeah.
3663000	3665000	Well A, it's an MMO so you can play it on the go.
3665000	3669000	I'll tell you what, you can bring 11 to the Switch because that should be able to run that.
3669000	3670000	Yeah.
3670000	3671000	I would hope.
3671000	3672000	You know the mobile version.
3672000	3676000	When is that coming out by the way, the mobile version of 11?
3676000	3678000	It's been like ten years.
3678000	3681000	The mobile version of 11 will soon be eligible for Classic Game of the Week.
3681000	3684000	Like it's that long they've been talking about it.
3684000	3685000	Anyway.
3685000	3692000	And yeah, RunJumpStomp says Yoshi P said they would port it to all platforms if all platform holders would agree to cross play.
3692000	3699000	And then Shad or Shane is in chat saying I'm pretty sure Yoshi P recently said it's Microsoft that's holding off an Xbox One port.
3699000	3700000	That's so shocking to me.
3700000	3702000	What do they have to lose?
3702000	3707000	But then Microsoft went and scored that deal with PSO2 so I don't- it's weird.
3707000	3708000	I don't-
3708000	3711000	I'm surprised that they wouldn't want Final Fantasy 14.
3711000	3712000	I would be, yeah.
3712000	3716000	Especially when they went out of their way to get Final Fantasy 11.
3716000	3722000	Again, you want to talk about like the first cross platform game that you could do Sony, Microsoft, and PCs?
3722000	3724000	That was Final Fantasy 11.
3724000	3728000	Like cross platform was not an issue back in 2006?
3728000	3731000	Well they all connected through the Play Online servers.
3731000	3732000	I know, I know.
3732000	3733000	That doesn't really count.
3733000	3734000	Yeah.
3734000	3735000	Anyway, alright.
3735000	3736000	We're going to move on though.
3736000	3737000	We're going to move on.
3737000	3739000	We could talk about cross play but the reality is we don't really know.
3739000	3740000	We're not in those boardrooms.
3740000	3746000	We can only kind of take our best guesses through what has been said in various interviews.
3746000	3752000	Anyway, moving on to the Epic Game Store and a game called Ooblets.
3752000	3759000	Because Ooblets has recently announced that they will be exclusive to the Epic Game Store temporarily.
3759000	3766000	Epic offered the development team of two people some financial incentives that would cover Ooblet
3766000	3771000	and what it would sell as if it were selling on all the different PC stores.
3771000	3774000	So, you know, it's a financial move, especially when it's two people putting it together.
3774000	3776000	It's like, you know, somebody's showing you some coin.
3776000	3779000	It's a financial move that is going to put bread on the table for a little while, right?
3779000	3780000	So it makes sense.
3780000	3783000	And that can help them grow their company and do more stuff.
3783000	3791000	But, oh my God, people got terrible about this because there are some people out there that really hate the Epic Game Store.
3791000	3795000	Yes, but I'll let you finish.
3795000	3802000	But there's, I think it's not necessarily the announcement that it's how they announced it.
3802000	3803000	Okay, fair, fair.
3803000	3804000	So let's move on then.
3804000	3810000	So there's an announcement that occurred and it was on the Patreon community.
3810000	3812000	So I can see, so people were paying money for this.
3812000	3814000	It's kind of like the Shenmue 3 thing, right?
3814000	3815000	Well, not necessarily that.
3815000	3818000	It's just, yeah, read through some of it.
3818000	3821000	Okay, I will.
3821000	3829000	The developer said they got thousands, if not tens of thousands of hateful, threatening messages across every platform nonstop.
3830000	3834000	And then Epic actually came to their defense and kind of said, you know,
3834000	3836000	we've shared our views about the game business and companies in it.
3836000	3838000	We support the game community's right to speak freely.
3838000	3844000	The announcements of Ooblets highlighted a disturbing trend, which is growing and undermining healthy public discourse.
3844000	3848000	And that's the coordinated and deliberate creation and promotion of false information,
3848000	3853000	including fake screenshots, videos and technical analysis accompanied by harassment of partners,
3853000	3857000	promotion of hateful themes and intimidation of those with opposing views.
3857000	3862000	Epic is working with many game developers and other partners to build what we believe is a healthier
3862000	3866000	and more competitive multi-store world for the future and so on and so on.
3866000	3869000	Now, if you want to go to the announcement, I'm trying to load it on their website right now.
3869000	3871000	Well, I'll save you the time.
3871000	3876000	So here's how they announced it and why I think people were kind of a little bit angry about it.
3876000	3880000	So they basically said, you know, here's what these epic folks are doing.
3880000	3884000	First, they teach every kid in the world these obnoxious dances,
3884000	3890000	and now they're offering funding to game developers in exchange for PC exclusivity on their game store.
3890000	3893000	This is exactly what Mark's warned us about.
3893000	3897000	Just imagine if other companies got it in their heads and offered funding in exchange for exclusives.
3897000	3902000	What would it be next? Game consoles paying for games to be exclusive on their consoles?
3902000	3906000	Netflix paying for exclusive shows? Newspapers paying for exclusive articles?
3906000	3909000	Maybe some sort of late capitalist dystopia.
3909000	3911000	OK, so it's very like talking down.
3911000	3917000	You could just say, hey, instead of being assholes like that, you could just say, hey,
3917000	3921000	we made this decision because we are just two people and it's good.
3921000	3925000	You know, we want to be exclusive. So we were using this extra capital to do this.
3925000	3929000	I think people will be more forgiving than that instead of talking down to people.
3929000	3933000	Yeah, and I will agree now that you've kind of put that in context, like that was a horrible way to deliver that message.
3933000	3938000	Absolutely. But you don't need to meet crap with worse crap.
3938000	3940000	You know what I mean? Like that's where this is a problem.
3940000	3946000	Like it's yes. Right. Yeah. You need to be told like this shitty tone, guys, like like fix it, fix it up.
3946000	3953000	But like going to the extent of spreading fake information, false screenshots, hate mail, death threats,
3953000	3959000	all the bullshit you see on Twitter and all that stuff like that is when it's like, y'all like y'all calm down.
3959000	3964000	Yeah. Like if they just don't like, you know, you know, you know, the best thing you can do.
3964000	3971000	It's not a tweet. It's not like the best thing you can do. If you're mad, don't buy it.
3971000	3976000	And not a concept. And that's all they had to do is like just exclude that like paragraph that was in there.
3976000	3980000	And it would be a decent announcement because the rest of it beyond that, like talks about what they're doing,
3980000	3985000	what Epic is doing for them, what it means to them, you know, and all that stuff.
3985000	3988000	And like how how it all like affects positively.
3988000	3993000	But like it's that asshole tone in the beginning that when people already don't like those types of announcements,
3993000	3998000	I don't think it's such a big deal when it's like an indie game like that coming to a platform exclusively.
3998000	4006000	That's fine because you understand that it's more of like the triple A companies that you don't need the extra Epic Games funding.
4006000	4014000	You know, you're not an independent studio that's trying to, you know, scrap or scrape together some money so that you can actually release your game.
4014000	4021000	You know, when you're take two or something, you're releasing Borderlands three on the platform and you really just getting some extra points.
4021000	4025000	You know, as far as the profit you're going to make, that's a little bit different.
4025000	4030000	But it doesn't help, though, when people are already sensitive about that stuff and you put in that tone.
4030000	4039000	But at the same time, you shouldn't, you know, people that are fans or gamers or whatever of that shit shouldn't be just harassing people over it.
4039000	4041000	Because come on, that's ridiculous.
4041000	4047000	S2100Matt in chat says, if you're mad, move on. The industry will continue to move on with or without you.
4047000	4052000	Questbuster says both sides are to blame, but the threats just played into their assessment of toxic gamers.
4052000	4057000	Yeah, like, I mean, people, there are valid criticisms of this statement in there, for sure.
4057000	4069000	But unfortunately, there's too many shitlords on the Internet that are doing the shit lordy thing that now like that is the thing that everybody can point at and go gamers are stupid, you know, and all that stuff.
4069000	4077000	And that's that is part of the reason then why in the real world when shitty things happen, people are quick to blame gamers.
4077000	4086000	Like, I hate to say it, but it is that part of the culture that we're not rejecting harshly enough that is playing into that.
4086000	4093000	I really believe that, you know, so again and again, I'm not saying I'm not saying like, oh, the Ooblets guys are totally in the right.
4093000	4096000	No, like they it's just I just don't buy it.
4096000	4103000	But once again, though, it's not the first company that's made a bad press release and we're talking like two people.
4103000	4108000	I'm sure they don't have a press person or a social media person. Mistakes happen.
4108000	4111000	So they're fine with it. They want it like a Facebook.
4111000	4118000	You know, when I get the sense of humor in it, too, like I'm like I read that and I'm like, I mean, I get your point.
4118000	4121000	I'm not like bent out of shape about it. I really care either.
4121000	4128000	I mean, the game is cute. It's so epic exclusive. I kind of over that whole epic exclusive stuff.
4128000	4133000	Like, oh, no, it's not in my Steam library. I'm kind of over it at this point.
4133000	4138000	But why are people so bent out of shape over something so small?
4138000	4142000	I don't understand. I'm kind of with Bobby a little bit on this, though, about his apprehensions about epic.
4142000	4145000	Like I have an epic store account to just hoard free games.
4145000	4150000	That's basically what I do. But Bobby, you know, makes a point about why he doesn't buy games.
4150000	4154000	I don't buy anything on epic game store simply because they don't have any wallet cards I could buy at a store.
4154000	4159000	I have to give them my credit card info and I don't trust any gaming company with my credit card info.
4159000	4166000	And like, I respect that in this day and age of data breaches, when the companies who track breaches get breached.
4166000	4169000	You know, those types of things, when it's that reductive.
4169000	4171000	Yo, Doug, I hear like breaches.
4171000	4178000	Exactly. Like Equifax, the credit monitoring company gets, in fact, breached, you know, because there's that whole get your $4.
4178000	4181000	Yeah, right. That whole thing. Like, I get it.
4181000	4184000	Like, you don't want to trust your information out there anywhere.
4184000	4190000	And, you know, I had money stolen on Xbox 360, certainly as a direct result of these types of breaches.
4190000	4196000	So, like, I get it. Yeah. She Hulk in chat says, trust no one.
4196000	4198000	X-Files. Yeah, for sure. Right.
4198000	4203000	Questbuster says, I have an epic account, but like Rob, it's only for the freebies.
4203000	4204000	Yeah, exactly.
4204000	4205000	I purchased a game.
4205000	4210000	Actually, sorry, I have to say this. Bobby says, I mean, my EGS account has already been hacked once and they got nothing.
4210000	4216000	Something like that happened to me. Somebody connected my Epic account to a PlayStation account that wasn't mine.
4216000	4220000	Because when I went to go do it, it was like, you're already connected to an account. I'm like, who the fuck is this?
4220000	4226000	So I kind of think my Epic account got breached at some point too.
4226000	4233000	So, like, I get it. Like, I, in fact, I would encourage people don't give Epic your credit card number. Seriously.
4233000	4236000	So I just use PayPal through it. Because I've got two factor on PayPal.
4236000	4237000	Yeah.
4237000	4243000	And I don't have, I don't have the automatic like, so, you know, pay, make it easier for PayPal to charge your account.
4243000	4248000	You know, don't just let it like, just do its thing. You know? No, I just two factor everything.
4248000	4253000	Pop culture in chat says, you know, Arrow works for a credit card processor, but it's not y'all's problem.
4253000	4255000	Like that, you're not the problem in your company.
4255000	4261000	Your companies aren't the reason the breaches are happening because of like crap security on Epic's side and things of that sort.
4261000	4265000	You know, so, you know, we already, and I think we're going to do it again tonight.
4265000	4272000	We already have read different companies in the gaming industry that you would think would do better with information not being able to do so.
4272000	4281000	You know, so just potentially, because I don't have the facts to back it up, except the fact that it happened to me, potentially add Epic into that, you know?
4281000	4285000	So, one more comment and then we'll move on to the classic game of the week.
4285000	4289000	SHO 100 Matt in chat says, gamers need to be the better person in today's age.
4289000	4295000	Now more than ever, terrible shit is happening all around us. Exclusivity in gaming.
4295000	4301000	That's like my arch nemesis word, isn't the type of thing worth getting upset over.
4301000	4303000	So, all right.
4303000	4310000	And Bobby Blackwell also says, I do thank Epic gamers for beta testing Borderlands 3 ahead of its launch next March.
4310000	4314000	All right. You get the joke there, right?
4315000	4317000	I was checking. Y'all got the joke, right?
4317000	4321000	Okay. Let's move on to a time when the jokes were simpler.
4321000	4324000	We're going to go to the classic game of the week.
4324000	4332000	And every week here on the show, usually when she's here, Dark Sakura will step into the gaming vault and find a game that she thinks, hey, you guys should be checking out this game this week.
4332000	4338000	But Dark Sakura, as we know, is taking a trip down memory lane with the 80s hits from Weird Al Yankovic.
4338000	4339000	That's why she's not here tonight.
4339000	4344000	So in her place tonight, usually I try to tape something in advance with a special guest.
4344000	4354000	But because of all the other stuff I've been doing today, namely a 30 minute immunity challenge, among other things, I didn't get around to doing that segment with somebody else.
4354000	4357000	So it's been a little while since Loki got to pick.
4357000	4363000	Yes. And unfortunately, I picked a good one first and then I thought of all these other ones afterwards.
4363000	4365000	I'm like, oh man, I should have done those.
4365000	4367000	I thought you meant the first one that you shot down.
4367000	4376000	I shot down his first pick because it's a pick where I said, no, that needs to be the game that's like on the last OLR or on some big number OLR game.
4376000	4381000	No, I'm not talking about that. I'm talking about like the other weird things I thought of after the fact.
4381000	4383000	But this is a really good one that you picked.
4383000	4386000	So when you texted me this, I'm like, oh, this is perfect.
4386000	4389000	So the game that we picked, I can describe it in one word.
4389000	4390000	Rush.
4390000	4393000	That's right. That's the sound I would hear every time I would go.
4393000	4398000	Oh, I just want to say I don't know how that happened. My template is muted over.
4398000	4402000	No, no. The classic game noise is just very low.
4402000	4407000	It's actually the long play is by classic game videos, not the name displayed there, but their watermark is on the corner there.
4407000	4409000	Sorry, guys. It's a typo on my end.
4409000	4420000	Anyways, that's the sound I used to hear every time I'd go play Cuzar because we had a San Francisco Rush Extreme Racing machine, actually two of them there to play.
4420000	4428000	And so San Francisco Rush Extreme Racing was a game that was put out by Atari Games published by Midway back in 1996.
4428000	4435000	It later then came out on consoles, of course, of the Nintendo 64 and 97 and finally PlayStation 98.
4435000	4448000	Of course, San Francisco Rush was a very stunt based racing game set in San Francisco with all sorts of crazy obstacle courses and shortcuts to go through.
4448000	4455000	Lots of air and all sorts of fun stuff. And I wasn't very good at it, but it was a lot of fun.
4455000	4463000	The game was they had several different versions of the game. They kind of all came out around the same time each other.
4463000	4467000	The one I played the most was actually San Francisco Rush The Rock.
4467000	4473000	So that version featured a set of tracks in Alcatraz, which are pretty fun as well.
4473000	4486000	That was in 97. And then, of course, they also had a version that came out in 98 that I was unaware of called San Francisco Rush The Rock Wave Net, which apparently supported online multiplayer.
4486000	4489000	All the way back in 98. That's kind of crazy.
4489000	4497000	So San Francisco Rush was built around the 3DFX Voodoo Graphics dual chip.
4497000	4500000	Voodoo Economics?
4500000	4505000	It was, yeah, it apparently had cars going 150 to 160 miles per hour.
4505000	4512000	And they, of course, created an alternate version of San Francisco for the game.
4512000	4518000	Some really great ports. So the Nintendo 64 edition, I remember playing that one quite a bit.
4518000	4524000	The PlayStation one as well. They also did it as part of the Midway Treasures, volume of three.
4524000	4530000	I believe it had all the racing games in there. That came out in GameCube, PlayStation 2, and Xbox at one time.
4530000	4533000	And I think I even have the PC version on that.
4533000	4540000	Of course, this followed up later on. They had an Nintendo 64 sequel, Rush 2 Extreme Racing USA.
4540000	4546000	That was released in 1998. And, of course, the arcade follow up, San Francisco Rush 2049.
4546000	4551000	And that came out later on in the Dreamcast and Nintendo 64 as well.
4551000	4557000	And then, finally, they had LA Rush, which was released in 2005. I never played that one.
4557000	4566000	But, yeah, got some decent reviews and I definitely spent a lot of money on this game.
4566000	4569000	And had a lot of fun playing it.
4569000	4572000	But, yeah, that's my pick. San Francisco Rush.
4572000	4578000	And we really need, like, an updated version of this to come out, aside from 2049.
4578000	4582000	I think they do have, actually, a newer one now that's one of those...
4582000	4588000	I don't know. I get that confused with Cruis'n USA or the Cruis'n series, but they need a new one.
4588000	4592000	Besides, the targets aren't really making anything decent.
4592000	4593000	Maybe this will be...
4593000	4595000	Oh, they have their own little computer, though.
4595000	4600000	I was about to say, maybe this will be something that comes out on their new console.
4600000	4607000	But, yeah. So, the Classic Game of the Week, San Francisco Rush, Extreme Racing.
4608000	4610000	Are you done there?
4610000	4614000	Sorry, I'm sending Jamie a text message real quick while she's at the concert.
4614000	4618000	There was a very kind gesture in our chat room that I want to make sure she knows about,
4618000	4620000	so I'm trying to text her right now. So, anyway.
4620000	4622000	Well, you don't have anything else to say about the game?
4622000	4624000	I don't have anything else to say. I wonder if this is something...
4624000	4629000	They should run this for Awesome Games Done Quick.
4629000	4633000	I would love to see, like, someone actually take all the shortcuts in these.
4633000	4635000	Did you ever play, like, the home versions on Nintendo 64?
4635000	4638000	I played the Nintendo 64 one, yeah, quite a bit, actually.
4638000	4643000	That was because it was actually a really good port of it, and I think that was the Rush to Rock one.
4643000	4647000	I just remember trying to play this, like, every time I'd go to try to hit that tunnel right there,
4647000	4648000	it always crashed in the roof.
4648000	4653000	It was just... That was one of the things with the driving cabinets that they had in here,
4653000	4656000	that, like, it was very hard to steer those cars.
4656000	4660000	I mean, they were just... Yeah, that was me pretty much the entire time,
4660000	4662000	just crashing into the walls.
4663000	4665000	But, yeah, it was a fun game.
4665000	4667000	You know what game you could have picked for racing?
4667000	4670000	F-Zero, because I don't think we... I don't think... Or F-Zero GX.
4670000	4672000	I don't think it's... I'm pretty sure we picked F-Zero.
4672000	4674000	Have we? Oh, maybe. I don't know. All right.
4674000	4677000	Anyway, no, but that's a really good pick. Like, I can't be mad about that, for sure.
4677000	4680000	So there it is, the classic game of the week. San Francisco Rush.
4680000	4682000	Yes. All right. Anyway, let's move on.
4682000	4685000	We've got plenty more show to go, plenty more stories to cover,
4685000	4688000	and your calls a little later on on our Discord server
4688000	4691000	over at vognetwork.com slash Discord.
4691000	4693000	That's vognetwork.com slash Discord.
4693000	4695000	First, some rapid fire news.
4695000	4699000	So the first thing we have is they finally put out the final list
4699000	4703000	of the PC Engine TurboGrafx-16 mini games that are going to be coming out.
4703000	4709000	So, newly announced games that are going to be coming to those versions as well.
4709000	4712000	So now we have, aside from everything that's been released so far,
4712000	4720000	Dragon's Spirit, Galaga 88, the Genji and the Hyaki clans,
4720000	4728000	The Legend of Valkyrie, Seirei Senshi Spriggan, and Spriggan Mark II,
4728000	4734000	as well as they're going to be including Splatterhouse as well.
4734000	4740000	And it makes a total of 50 games that are going to be bundled with those now.
4740000	4742000	So that's pretty awesome.
4742000	4744000	March, I don't know.
4744000	4748000	I didn't get in on that, but eh, what are you going to do?
4748000	4751000	I did, and hearing this news makes me even happier.
4751000	4753000	Now we get Splatterhouse too on top of all that,
4753000	4755000	and there are some other good games in there too.
4755000	4757000	I'm so pumped for this TurboGrafx.
4757000	4761000	Never in my life have I been excited about a TurboGrafx thing, but I am tonight.
4761000	4763000	So this is pretty exciting.
4763000	4767000	So there is a brand new total conversion mod
4767000	4770000	that's being done for Serious Sam Fusion,
4770000	4774000	or I should say Serious Sam 3 is part of Serious Sam Fusion,
4774000	4780000	and it is a total conversion that puts the game of Duke Nukem 3D in that engine.
4780000	4785000	So it is a remake of Duke Nukem 3D, but here's the best part about it.
4785000	4790000	So not only is it Duke Nukem 3D with better graphics and better gameplay,
4790000	4796000	but they have expanded levels, new weapons, new music made just for the mod,
4796000	4802000	and VR support, and it looks fucking awesome.
4802000	4806000	And the best part is it's free, so you can actually find it.
4806000	4812000	It's called Serious Duke 3D, so go to the Serious Sam Fusion 2017.
4812000	4816000	They have the beta version I think that you can get.
4816000	4821000	And if you have Serious Sam 3, then you can download this mod for free,
4821000	4825000	and it's linked within their forums that they have in Steam.
4825000	4829000	But I've got to check this out. I think I have all the Serious Sam collection.
4829000	4832000	I don't know if I have Fusion though, but I'll take a look at that.
4832000	4836000	But it looked really good, so I'm really wanting to check this out.
4836000	4841000	It looks actually, funny enough, better than what Gearbox would have done with this stuff.
4841000	4847000	So before I get to my rapid-fire stories, I've been texting DarkSakura a little bit
4847000	4850000	because of that very kind gesture from She-Hulk in our chat room.
4851000	4856000	But DarkSakura actually texted me this very lovely picture.
4856000	4858000	That's why I stood up for a minute here, so I can show it again.
4858000	4861000	Very lovely picture of herself and Dan. There you go.
4861000	4864000	They're at the Weirdo concert. You can see the empty seats behind them.
4864000	4867000	So I don't think it started just yet. It probably starts at about 8 o'clock.
4867000	4873000	So very lovely. What a handsome couple there. They look great.
4873000	4877000	So good photo. Thank you, She-Hulk, because I probably would not have texted her
4877000	4880000	if you hadn't provoked me to with that lovely gesture in our chat room.
4880000	4884000	So there you go. Anyway, I'm sure they'll be having fun at the concert.
4884000	4890000	RumJumpStompInChat says, when I saw Weird Al, he stayed after and met every single fan that wanted to.
4890000	4893000	That sounds like such a weird Al thing to do. It really does.
4893000	4898000	I remember when DarkSakura and I went to see Greg Proops,
4898000	4902000	and he didn't have the hugest turnout here in SAC because his podcast was still new,
4902000	4908000	and it was right around New Year's. I think it was the Saturday between Christmas and New Year's,
4908000	4911000	and he was here, so he didn't have the hugest crowd.
4911000	4914000	It was on a Thursday night, but DarkSakura and I went, and he was really cool.
4914000	4916000	He came around and shook everybody's hand in the audience.
4916000	4918000	It was like, thank you for being here. I'm Greg. Who are you?
4918000	4920000	So I always thought that was a very classy move.
4920000	4923000	I think he still does the smartest man in the world thing.
4923000	4928000	He's had that podcast for forever. We went and saw that live once. It was a lot of fun.
4928000	4932000	Bobby Blackwell says Penn and Teller also hang out in the lobby. That's really cool.
4932000	4937000	I love it when people are... I think that's a very humble thing to do.
4937000	4944000	But I also respect sometimes when folks are emotionally spent and they can't do that stuff.
4944000	4947000	I don't think people should ever have an expectation,
4947000	4953000	because I can totally respect when maybe a performer has put their all into a performance,
4953000	4959000	and so they just don't have that emotional gas tank or whatever you want to call it to go out and see everybody.
4959000	4964000	I totally respect that, but that is amazing these folks that can do that and do have that energy
4964000	4967000	kind of going that extra mile. That's always really, really cool.
4967000	4971000	Anyway, let's move on. Sorry, that was a random tangent, but it happens here on OLR.
4971000	4975000	Getting into some other gaming news, a big tweet from Reggie Fils-Aime,
4975000	4980000	who ever since he kind of stepped down as head of Nintendo America,
4980000	4985000	he has a Twitter account. He doesn't really tweet every day. He doesn't speak up all the time.
4985000	4988000	I think he's just probably enjoying retirement and time with his kids.
4988000	4991000	And he fucking earned it, so let him, right?
4991000	4996000	But he showed up this week. I got something to say, pretty much.
4996000	4999000	And so when Reggie speaks, y'all better fucking listen.
4999000	5005000	And this has to do with a comment on deadly mass shootings and the violence in America
5005000	5008000	and some of the blame that video games are taking for this.
5008000	5011000	And Reggie Fils-Aime tweeted the following, and I quote,
5011000	5016000	When the ill-informed are being critical of the gaming industry and community,
5016000	5018000	this is a very powerful story.
5018000	5023000	He had actually quote-tweeted a Jeff Keighley story about video games
5023000	5028000	and bringing people together and actually helping to get somebody to get Canadian citizenship
5028000	5032000	through the power of video games. So this was a quote-tweet for Reggie Fils-Aime.
5032000	5035000	You can attach somebody else's tweet. So this is what that was.
5035000	5038000	So anyway, this is a very powerful story.
5038000	5044000	The facts are that countries with higher per capita gaming revenue have fewer gun shooting deaths,
5044000	5049000	except the US, where 4% of the population own 43% of the guns.
5049000	5053000	And you know, I don't want to step into gun debate tonight,
5053000	5058000	but I think he does make that point, as a lot of people have said this point.
5058000	5061000	Japan has the same video games we do.
5061000	5064000	Most of the countries in Europe have the same video games we do.
5064000	5068000	Australia, save for one or two, like Mortal Kombat and stuff,
5068000	5070000	you know, some of those tragedy, or not tragedy, sorry,
5070000	5073000	some of those controversies is the word I was looking for.
5073000	5077000	Australia, for the most part, has the same video games we do, and so on and so on.
5077000	5082000	These countries do not have the level of the problems we have.
5082000	5085000	Yes, we all know there was a horrific incident that happened in New Zealand.
5085000	5088000	It doesn't happen at the frequency that it's happening here.
5088000	5089000	You know what I mean?
5089000	5095000	Right, and we understand that, but it's pretty transparent why politicians are blaming video games,
5095000	5099000	because they're getting paid by the NRA, they get money from the NRA.
5099000	5101000	And they don't get money from video games.
5101000	5104000	They don't get money from video games, and unfortunately they're beholden to money,
5104000	5109000	and so they just blame video games because it's an old way of thinking, blaming other things.
5109000	5114000	There's been so many things to blame violence on, like whether it was comic books,
5114000	5122000	or rock and roll music, or movies, or TV, or video games, or whatever.
5122000	5128000	I mean, Magic the Gathering, I mean, just all sorts of ridiculous things that people blame violence on,
5128000	5129000	and it's never-
5129000	5131000	Oh, Bobby in chat says D&D. I remember-
5131000	5132000	D&D, yes.
5132000	5136000	When my mom was like, you're playing Dungeons and Dragons, you can't rob.
5136000	5138000	Don't use your imagination, at least of violence!
5138000	5148000	I know, but what's interesting to me is because I do think my mom learned a lot in the years that she was alive that I was growing up.
5148000	5156000	I think she learned a lot through me, and I think my mom in her late 70s before she passed,
5156000	5159000	I think if she looked back at some of the things she had said when I was growing up like that,
5159000	5164000	I think she would go, at least he wasn't doing drugs.
5164000	5168000	That would have honestly been what she would have fallen on.
5168000	5172000	It's like, so he was playing D&D, at least he wasn't doing drugs, you know?
5172000	5181000	It's stupid, and it really is, and unfortunately, if the government makes decisions about censoring video games,
5181000	5187000	we're not going to see any change in the violence that's out there, and it's not going to make a difference.
5188000	5193000	They just need to get the work that needs to be done, done.
5193000	5198000	When everybody keeps saying, do something about the gun violence, do something about the guns, they need to do that.
5198000	5204000	The problem is, the base that supports the people that are in power right now, they love their guns,
5204000	5210000	and they won't have anybody telling them that guns are bad, because they're used as a threat.
5210000	5215000	Oh, if these people get elected, they're going to take your guns away, and that's what it comes down to, is politics.
5215000	5222000	The cracks in all of that are starting to show, it's taken way too fucking long, but the cracks in that are finally starting to show.
5222000	5227000	The governor of Ohio tried to give some speech right after all that.
5227000	5231000	There were all of these people out there yelling, do something, do something, do something.
5231000	5234000	They just started screaming during this whole thing, do something.
5234000	5237000	And he pretty much was not able to give his speech, and you know what?
5237000	5243000	The next day, he came out and said, I think maybe it's time to look at doing this type of thing.
5243000	5248000	I don't remember the exact thing he proposed, but I don't remember if it was the extended background checks or something like that,
5248000	5254000	but it took the people going out and being fucking pissed off to finally make that change.
5254000	5256000	And it took way too long.
5256000	5262000	And then when you had the president mimicking that, well, maybe we'll look at extending the background checks or whatever,
5262000	5267000	then he gets a call from the NRA saying, that's not a good idea, you shouldn't be doing that,
5267000	5272000	and then he walks it back because, hey, if you want our support, you're not going to do that.
5272000	5276000	Anyway, I think Dark Titsia kind of wraps this up, to try to shift away from politics,
5276000	5279000	Dark Titsia I think kind of wraps this up nicely with his comment in our chat saying,
5279000	5285000	I didn't want to open this can of worms again, I just thought it was really great that Reggie would go to bat for us.
5285000	5287000	And I absolutely agree, absolutely agree.
5287000	5293000	You know, it's great that, because Reggie didn't have to say shit, he doesn't work in the video games industry anymore.
5293000	5300000	Reggie can sit there sipping a drink out of a coconut on the Bahamas and the islands and not give a fuck about any of this,
5300000	5307000	and he would be well within his rights to do so, but the fact that he is still, like, he's showing up from all that to say something about this,
5307000	5312000	that's near and dear to his heart, like, as if we didn't love him enough, right?
5312000	5316000	As if we didn't love Reggie enough, like, anyway, what a stud.
5316000	5320000	Alright, anyway, that's all I can say about Reggie, what a stud.
5320000	5322000	I think even heterosexual men can agree, what a stud.
5322000	5324000	Alright, moving on.
5324000	5332000	Going to a completely different comment here on Sega Ages and the Sega Ages collection.
5332000	5338000	Space Harrier and Puyo Puyo are games that will be coming out on August 22nd in the West.
5338000	5343000	So, yeah, the Sega Ages lineup, very cool, kind of adds a little something to these classic games.
5343000	5348000	Obviously, Puyo Puyo was also Kirby's Dream Machine, or was it Kirby's?
5348000	5355000	I might add, I think I mixed the titles, Mr. Robot, or Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine and Kirby's Dream?
5355000	5356000	Kirby, or was it?
5356000	5359000	Kirby's Avalanche! Oh my god, why is that name escaping?
5359000	5362000	Like, you even say it in the beginning of that game, Kirby's Avalanche!
5362000	5363000	Anyways, sorry!
5363000	5368000	I'm sure Act F is, like, screaming the name in chat right now, but I did figure it out before I read chat.
5368000	5373000	Okay, so anyway, Puyo Puyo is the game all of those are based on, and that will be very cool.
5373000	5378000	I mean, I think a lot of people saw the Puyo Puyo Cross Tetris was out recently on Switch too, and PS4.
5378000	5383000	So Puyo Puyo is making its way to Sega Ages, and of course Space Harrier, which, you know,
5383000	5386000	Dark Soccer is one of her favorite quotes, the welcome to the fantasy zone, get ready.
5386000	5391000	That all comes from Space Harrier, so it's a bummer she's not here tonight to read this story herself,
5391000	5396000	but I'm sure she will have her hands all over this come August 22nd, so that's going to be very cool.
5396000	5400000	They will be out on the Nintendo Switch coming August 22nd.
5400000	5402000	I think I'll have to pick that up.
5402000	5408000	Space Harrier really reminds me of a game called 3D World Runner, which I'm sure was, like, inspired by,
5408000	5413000	you know, I'm sure there's a lot, but I happen to play the other one first.
5413000	5416000	So, but, like, Space Harrier is very cool, so I kind of want to check that out.
5416000	5419000	That might be a game I can stream, we'll see.
5419000	5424000	Anyway, let's move on. Let's talk about what is in stores this week.
5424000	5428000	Let's travel around the world and check out video games coming to a store near you.
5428000	5431000	Well, we've got Friday the 13th, the game coming out on Nintendo Switch.
5431000	5433000	Oh, yeah, finally I'm making a way to the Switch, yeah.
5433000	5437000	Because the 13th falls on this week, that's why they're releasing it.
5437000	5443000	We have the Bard's Tale trilogy on Xbox One, Rebel Galaxy Outlaw on PC,
5443000	5447000	Ion Fury on PC, Mac, and Linux.
5447000	5452000	We've got a Vasara collection on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.
5452000	5456000	And finally, the Grandia HD collection on Nintendo Switch.
5457000	5459000	All right, not sure what's going on in Japan this week,
5459000	5461000	but it seems like it's kind of a slower week.
5461000	5464000	We don't really have a lot of releases on the PlayStation 4.
5464000	5466000	They don't really ramp up until August 22nd,
5466000	5468000	so the PlayStation 4 is pretty quiet in Japan.
5468000	5474000	Taking a peek at the Nintendo Switch, I don't see anything out there either.
5474000	5476000	Like, there's some peripherals and things,
5476000	5478000	but they don't really pick up until this 22nd either.
5478000	5480000	I don't know if there's holidays or what have you going on,
5480000	5482000	but it's just a very slow time of the year,
5482000	5486000	so no Japanese releases outside of just minor hardware
5486000	5489000	and things like that to talk about right now.
5489000	5491000	So there you go.
5491000	5493000	Let's move on to the UK, Loki.
5493000	5495000	All right, not much coming out of the UK either.
5495000	5498000	We've got Yu-Gi-Oh! Legacy of the Duelist Link Evolution
5498000	5501000	coming out on Nintendo Switch, and that is it.
5501000	5503000	All right, it must be slow.
5503000	5505000	But I mean, August isn't typically a big time.
5505000	5507000	I feel like around Labor Day.
5507000	5509000	We're going to ramp up for September.
5509000	5510000	That's true.
5510000	5511000	But once we start to get into September,
5511000	5513000	it's going to really start to ramp up again,
5513000	5515000	so that certainly makes sense.
5515000	5519000	All right, sorry, I misclicked on the little story bar
5519000	5521000	on the right-hand side, so we're behind a little bit.
5521000	5523000	So we're going to move on from world release dates
5523000	5525000	and head on into our mailbag.
5525000	5527000	Every week, we invite your e-mails over at
5527000	5530000	participate at orangeloungeradio.com,
5530000	5532000	and we read some of our favorite e-mails here on the show.
5532000	5535000	Actually, this week, we really only have one e-mail,
5535000	5538000	so let's get to it over at participate at orangeloungeradio.com.
5538000	5540000	Robert M. with a follow-up to last week,
5540000	5541000	when we were talking about Pokémon Go
5541000	5544000	and some of the new filtering systems in Pokémon Go.
5544000	5545000	Robert M. starts off this week,
5545000	5547000	thank you very much for the advice for Pokémon Go.
5547000	5551000	I did find that I have three four-star Pokémon,
5551000	5553000	which I marked as favorites.
5553000	5554000	You're going to tell us that
5554000	5556000	and then not tell us what Pokémon they were?
5556000	5558000	I'm so disappointed.
5558000	5559000	All right, oh well.
5559000	5562000	I will say I got a second Sentret
5562000	5564000	that's a perfect Sentret this week,
5564000	5566000	so I have two perfect Sentrets.
5566000	5568000	I mean, of all the freaking Pokémon to have perfects,
5568000	5569000	I get that one.
5569000	5570000	Oh well.
5570000	5572000	Anyway, Robert M. continues,
5572000	5575000	as far as other gaming stuffs,
5575000	5577000	I have become pretty hooked on the Switch port
5577000	5579000	of Lethal League Blaze.
5579000	5581000	It's been out since what?
5581000	5583000	October on Windows,
5583000	5585000	more recently having a Mac port,
5585000	5587000	along with the original.
5587000	5589000	Have any of you checked this one out?
5589000	5590000	Thanks again.
5590000	5591000	And that is from Robert M.
5591000	5592000	I must admit,
5592000	5594000	I don't know a lot about Lethal League Blaze,
5594000	5595000	so I'm actually trying to pull up
5595000	5597000	a little more information on this right now.
5597000	5600000	It is a projectile fighting game, apparently,
5600000	5603000	that's available on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch,
5603000	5605000	and of course, as was mentioned there,
5605000	5607000	Windows and Mac OS.
5607000	5612000	So yeah, it looks like it's a high-speed ball game
5612000	5614000	with different characters.
5614000	5617000	And yeah, interesting.
5617000	5620000	I'm trying to look at the description.
5620000	5622000	Something on Google caught my eye here
5622000	5623000	when I Googled this game.
5623000	5626000	I have to see if it really says this.
5626000	5629000	Hold on here.
5629000	5631000	Okay, when I Google it,
5631000	5635000	the little preview on Nintendo's site...
5635000	5636000	Hold on, I gotta go back to this,
5636000	5637000	because this is really interesting.
5637000	5639000	So I Googled the name of the game.
5639000	5640000	Yeah, okay.
5640000	5642000	So look, this little preview here of Nintendo's site.
5642000	5643000	It says,
5643000	5647000	Lethal League Blaze is an intense high-speed ball game
5647000	5650000	with unique characters, out-of-sight sounds,
5650000	5652000	and none of that weak shit.
5653000	5654000	Yeah, it's actually...
5654000	5656000	Lethal League is pretty awesome.
5656000	5657000	Hold on, hold on.
5657000	5660000	Who got the word shit on a Nintendo website?
5660000	5661000	That's what I want to know.
5661000	5663000	Where did that shit come from?
5663000	5665000	Literally, where did that shit come from?
5668000	5669000	I don't know.
5669000	5671000	And now I'm looking at the site itself,
5671000	5673000	and it's telling me that my computer is not running
5673000	5676000	a good enough browser, and I need to upgrade and so forth.
5676000	5678000	But that is so funny.
5678000	5680000	Is that like a user comment or something?
5680000	5682000	What I like about Lethal League Blaze,
5682000	5684000	and one of the things, actually,
5684000	5688000	I have one of the tracks on my rotation that I listen to.
5688000	5693000	So Hideki Naganuma does music on there,
5693000	5696000	and you may remember him from...
5697000	5699000	No, I can't remember the damn god...
5699000	5701000	Fucking the roller skating...
5702000	5704000	Oh, Jet Set.
5704000	5705000	Jet Set Radio, thank you.
5705000	5707000	Yes, so you may remember him from Jet Set Radio,
5707000	5708000	or from 2DX.
5708000	5710000	He also did songs in 2DX as well,
5710000	5712000	but he has a song in there called
5712000	5714000	Ain't Nothin' Like...
5714000	5716000	What was it?
5716000	5719000	Was it Ain't Nothin' Like...
5719000	5721000	Well, you can tell that that's gonna be the tone, though,
5721000	5722000	like a Jet Set...
5722000	5723000	That's a game.
5723000	5725000	Oh my god, Sega's AAA announcement.
5725000	5727000	Oh my god, Loki, Loki, Loki.
5727000	5728000	Sega's AAA announcement.
5728000	5730000	What if? What if?
5730000	5731000	That'd be cool.
5731000	5732000	A new Jet Set game.
5732000	5735000	And it's AAA because the music is gonna be off the charts.
5735000	5737000	Oh, now look, I'm getting my hopes up.
5737000	5739000	This is me getting my hopes up live.
5739000	5741000	Now I want Sega to announce a new Jet Set game.
5741000	5743000	Oh my god, that'd be so amazing.
5743000	5745000	It's probably gonna be like a new Dead or Alive.
5745000	5746000	Yeah.
5746000	5749000	SSG100Matt and Chad said the exact same thing
5749000	5750000	at the same time.
5750000	5754000	What if that AAA game is Jet Set in that series?
5755000	5757000	Hey, you know what they say, SSG100Matt,
5757000	5758000	great minds think like me.
5758000	5759000	Oh, no, Tecmo's Dead or Alive.
5759000	5760000	What's the Sega one?
5760000	5761000	Virtual Fighter?
5761000	5762000	Yeah, Virtual Fighter.
5762000	5763000	The Sega thing.
5763000	5764000	Yeah.
5764000	5765000	You never know.
5765000	5766000	All right.
5766000	5767000	Dark Tetsuya says,
5767000	5769000	well, I think Hideki is composing for Streets of Rage 4.
5769000	5771000	Yeah, I think so too.
5771000	5773000	And Act Def bringing us down to reality saying,
5773000	5775000	that would be amazing, but I don't think it's happening.
5775000	5776000	Womp womp.
5776000	5779000	But the game is really weird, so it's a fighting game,
5779000	5782000	but with a baseball or something like that.
5782000	5784000	So they're actually throwing this ball around
5784000	5785000	as you're fighting.
5785000	5786000	It's really weird.
5786000	5788000	But it looks pretty cool.
5788000	5790000	Speaking of Sega letting us down,
5790000	5792000	you remember that Actraiser clone they were doing?
5792000	5793000	Yeah.
5793000	5794000	Yeah, I'm hearing it.
5794000	5795000	Yeah, I know.
5795000	5796000	I'm hearing this ain't it.
5796000	5797000	Garbage.
5797000	5798000	This ain't it.
5798000	5799000	Spiritual six.
5799000	5800000	Ain't it.
5800000	5801000	That's a bummer.
5801000	5803000	I still kind of want to try it and see for myself
5803000	5805000	because, you know, I don't remember Actraiser being
5805000	5807000	on people's top 10 list back in the day.
5807000	5809000	Like that was kind of one of those like underground
5809000	5810000	sort of like titles.
5810000	5813000	But a lot of stuff I'm reading about the Sega thing.
5813000	5814000	Yeah.
5814000	5816000	It's a new Altered Beast.
5816000	5817000	That's what the.
5817000	5818000	Yike.
5818000	5819000	Yike.
5819000	5820000	All right.
5820000	5821000	Moving on.
5821000	5823000	Let's get to some more news.
5823000	5824000	Loki.
5824000	5825000	All right.
5825000	5829000	So because as we were just talking about the whole
5829000	5832000	gun debate and everything and with everybody blaming
5832000	5835000	video games for the violence,
5835000	5837000	Walmart does the most Walmart thing ever.
5837000	5839000	And they decided that, hey, guess what?
5839000	5841000	We're going to remove all violent video game signage
5841000	5846000	in the store so that we don't we want to any signing
5846000	5849000	or display that contains violent images or aggressive
5849000	5850000	behavior needs to come down.
5850000	5853000	So remove, turn off, cancel.
5853000	5856000	You know, anything that has to do with that stuff
5856000	5859000	because of these mass shootings that have been going on.
5859000	5862000	We're still going to sell guns,
5862000	5864000	but remove those video game signs.
5864000	5867000	Just so you know, no one gets offended.
5867000	5870000	I think I mean, if they don't want to advertise
5870000	5872000	or promote certain games, you know,
5872000	5873000	they are within their rights.
5873000	5876000	I just I'm disappointed that they have played into
5876000	5879000	this narrative that is false.
5879000	5882000	That certain people are putting out there about video games
5882000	5884000	and the effect that it has on people with no proof
5884000	5885000	to back that up.
5885000	5889000	Especially when, again, video games are not something
5889000	5891000	unique to the United States of America.
5891000	5895000	These same video games are in Canada, Australia,
5895000	5898000	Britain, Scotland, Japan.
5898000	5899000	The list goes on and on.
5899000	5900000	You get the point.
5900000	5902000	And they don't have these same problems
5902000	5903000	in these other places.
5903000	5904000	Yet we have them here.
5904000	5907000	Well, so it's just it's just disappointing that
5907000	5910000	Walmart kind of got on that bandwagon, so to speak.
5910000	5911000	Well, on top of that, also,
5911000	5917000	there was supposed to be some sort of what was it?
5917000	5919000	I don't know if it was an no, it wasn't anthem.
5919000	5924000	It was the there was supposed to be some other like
5924000	5928000	online competition that was going to be around.
5928000	5929000	I can't remember the name of the game.
5929000	5931000	But anyways, they were like postponing it again
5931000	5932000	because of the mass shootings.
5932000	5935000	And it was funny because like I was watching Jim Sterling
5935000	5937000	talking about, you know, these mass shootings
5937000	5939000	and stuff and how they're postponing this tournament
5939000	5940000	because of that.
5940000	5943000	He's like, so what are they going to do next week
5943000	5944000	when the next mass shooting happens
5944000	5946000	or the next week when the next mass shooting happens
5946000	5947000	or the week after that?
5947000	5949000	They're just going to keep pushing this tournament
5949000	5951000	down the road because of these mass shootings.
5951000	5953000	It's not going to change anything
5953000	5956000	because game violence doesn't have any bearing
5956000	5958000	on this mass shooting stuff.
5958000	5960000	Now, Dr. Suya in chat says,
5960000	5962000	don't they only sell the clean versions of albums
5962000	5963000	or am I remembering it wrong?
5963000	5964000	No, they used to.
5964000	5966000	That was the thing that they used to do.
5966000	5967000	I don't think they do that anymore.
5967000	5968000	Well, I think in general,
5968000	5970000	they got out of the music business.
5970000	5972000	They still sell music, but it's very little.
5972000	5975000	Even like movies is very, very skilled back.
5975000	5977000	Because a lot of that went digital.
5977000	5979000	And I'm sure games are going to go that same way, too,
5979000	5981000	as more and more of that goes digital.
5981000	5982000	Yeah, eventually.
5982000	5983000	You know what else is kind of weird
5983000	5984000	about this whole story in a very like
5984000	5986000	it's a small world kind of way?
5986000	5988000	Like the guy that broke this on Twitter
5988000	5990000	and had the copy of the Walmart announcement
5990000	5991000	and all that.
5991000	5992000	Yeah, longtime Twitter friend of mine.
5992000	5993000	I was like the second or third person.
5993000	5994000	I like that tweet.
5994000	5995000	Yeah, I know, right?
5995000	5997000	It's a weird like small world type of thing.
5997000	5999000	I don't know where he got it.
5999000	6002000	I have a theory, but it's not within my,
6002000	6004000	it's not my business at all to say.
6004000	6005000	But yeah, I just thought that,
6005000	6006000	I thought that was interesting
6006000	6008000	because I remember seeing that tweet.
6008000	6010000	And I remember, I think I might've even retweeted it
6010000	6012000	because I was like, very, I was like, God,
6012000	6014000	I was like, geez, Louis, you know,
6014000	6016000	I'm just rolling my eyes again.
6016000	6019000	Like, you know, video games getting blamed for things.
6019000	6020000	And then what is this?
6020000	6021000	What year is this?
6021000	6023000	Suddenly I'm reading a story on NPR
6023000	6025000	and they like linked to that same tweet.
6025000	6028000	And I was like, oh, I know.
6028000	6029000	I'm happy for him though
6029000	6031000	because I think he's trying to like land a journalism.
6031000	6032000	Like he's kind of like trying to find
6032000	6034000	a journalism position and stuff now.
6034000	6036000	So hopefully this will, in a weird way,
6036000	6038000	bring some attention and maybe help him with that.
6038000	6042000	So anyway, it's a weird aside,
6042000	6043000	but you guys have to admit like,
6043000	6044000	has that ever happened to you
6044000	6045000	where like you're on a website
6045000	6047000	and like you see a tweet or you see a thing
6047000	6049000	and you're like, I know that person.
6049000	6052000	Like that's the weird like kind of world we live in, right?
6052000	6053000	Yeah.
6053000	6056000	Anyway, let's see.
6056000	6058000	Going to the chat for some of the comments.
6058000	6060000	Bob Coffee says, music got scaled back,
6060000	6063000	but games and PC gaming got scaled up.
6063000	6064000	Interesting.
6064000	6067000	ST100Matt says, I'm sure they will still green light
6067000	6070000	during midnight and launches of Call of Duty and so forth.
6070000	6071000	Oh yeah.
6071000	6072000	Yeah.
6072000	6074000	Kaishudo in chat says, there's a method to the madness.
6074000	6075000	You have crazy people that want to copy
6075000	6077000	the latest news headline.
6077000	6078000	So it's smart to postpone it if you can.
6078000	6081000	Just till it's out of the news cycle.
6081000	6086000	But at the same time, you know, it's,
6086000	6090000	then maybe, you know, I know, of course,
6090000	6091000	we can't stop selling guns.
6091000	6094000	It's just, we can't do that.
6094000	6096000	Anyway, let's move on.
6096000	6098000	Let's let's go to somewhat lighter fare
6098000	6100000	and talk about, let's talk about real problems.
6100000	6102000	Oh, Ninja.
6102000	6103000	There's even more to this.
6103000	6104000	Okay.
6104000	6105000	You get into the second half
6105000	6106000	because I saw some of this in chat
6106000	6107000	and I was like, wait a minute,
6107000	6108000	you get into the second half.
6108000	6109000	I'll tell the first half.
6109000	6110000	Okay, here's the first half.
6110000	6113000	So the first half is that, as you all know,
6113000	6114000	Ninja left Twitch.
6114000	6116000	I mean, here we are two weeks later,
6116000	6117000	we're still talking about it,
6117000	6119000	but it's because he went over to Mixer.
6119000	6121000	So he's over there now.
6121000	6124000	I haven't watched, I didn't watch the streams before.
6124000	6125000	I haven't watched them since the move,
6125000	6127000	but I, once in a while I check out things on Mixer,
6127000	6129000	especially like the official Microsoft stuff.
6129000	6132000	You know, I have a few, I did like two broadcasts on Mixer.
6132000	6134000	I always see a trailer for,
6134000	6138000	or they have a loop that's in GameStop
6138000	6139000	because we go there occasionally
6139000	6141000	so my son can play the demos for...
6141000	6142000	For Mixer?
6142000	6145000	Yeah, Microsoft, they have a kiosk for Microsoft.
6145000	6147000	No playable demos there, but we have,
6147000	6150000	it's a trailer for Mixer
6150000	6152000	and they have a trailer for that
6152000	6154000	accessibility controller that they have,
6154000	6156000	which I'm like, that's cool that they have a trailer there
6156000	6158000	for that, but who's really buying that?
6158000	6160000	No one's buying that here at GameStop right now,
6160000	6161000	but it's cool that they have it.
6161000	6163000	But there's a long trailer for Mixer.
6163000	6165000	Showing like someone playing Forza Horizon.
6165000	6169000	Okay, so anyway, Twitch has kind of repurposed
6169000	6170000	his channel a little bit.
6170000	6173000	I mean, it's, look, Twitch got a lot of clicks.
6173000	6175000	It makes sense, I think, for, sorry,
6175000	6176000	Ninja got Twitch a lot of clicks.
6176000	6178000	It makes sense for Twitch to kind of repurpose
6178000	6180000	his channel a little bit for the people
6180000	6181000	that might end up there or be curious.
6181000	6184000	And so they changed it with a message that says,
6184000	6186000	the Ninja you're looking for is in another castle, right?
6186000	6188000	I'll throw back to Mario.
6188000	6189000	TEEHEE.
6189000	6191000	Check out these other popular live channels
6191000	6193000	and then of course it shows, you know,
6193000	6195000	other people playing Fortnite and so forth.
6195000	6197000	And some of the other big streamers
6197000	6199000	that do Fortnite is out there.
6199000	6202000	So that is what Twitch did.
6202000	6204000	But apparently there's a part two to this, right, Loki?
6204000	6208000	Yes, the part two is apparently that now on Twitch
6208000	6210000	it is showing the top Fortnite streamers
6210000	6212000	on his channel instead.
6212000	6216000	And what do you think was the top Fortnite streamer recently?
6216000	6219000	Why, it was people fucking on camera.
6219000	6221000	That's right, people fucking on Twitch,
6221000	6224000	right on camera for everybody to see.
6224000	6226000	That's the new Fortnite and guess which video
6226000	6230000	was number one on that channel for Ninja.
6230000	6233000	That's right, it's people fucking the game.
6233000	6237000	And of course he was not happy about that.
6237000	6241000	He says this is disgusted and I'm so sorry.
6241000	6243000	Oh, give me a break.
6243000	6245000	That's what he said, did he put out a comment
6245000	6247000	as to how disgusted he is about this?
6247000	6251000	Yeah, Ninja did, because it's not his channel anymore.
6251000	6254000	Okay, like look, ha ha, somebody got
6254000	6256000	porned out on Twitch.
6256000	6258000	I'm sure Twitch shut that down ASAP.
6258000	6262000	But don't fucking fame like, oh my God,
6262000	6265000	really, in front of my salad?
6265000	6267000	Really?
6270000	6274000	Somebody game the system, I'm sure it got shut down.
6274000	6277000	Somebody got a screen grab in the 30 seconds it was up.
6277000	6279000	His channel now, he says Twitch has now reverted
6279000	6282000	my channel back to how an offline page should look.
6282000	6284000	Thank you.
6284000	6286000	So they've shut everything down now.
6286000	6288000	Oh my God.
6288000	6292000	But seriously, it's just, it's ridiculous.
6292000	6294000	And I saw a screenshot and I was like...
6294000	6296000	Run Jump Stomp said Twitch left it running for over two hours.
6296000	6298000	Was it like on the weekend or something?
6298000	6300000	How did it go for so long?
6300000	6302000	I don't know, but like, come on Twitch dude.
6302000	6304000	Well, I mean...
6304000	6306000	Okay, we all know that the Fortnite
6306000	6308000	top recommended stream thing is probably
6308000	6310000	automated, right? We've already
6310000	6312000	talked about what people read into those thumbnails
6312000	6314000	and so forth. Do you think
6314000	6316000	that these people fucking
6316000	6318000	or whatever, do you think that is the world's
6318000	6320000	first people
6320000	6322000	on Twitch having sex?
6322000	6324000	No, of course not, because we had playroom.
6324000	6326000	I was just about to say,
6326000	6328000	I was just about to say the fucking playroom
6328000	6330000	on PlayStation 4. Like, oh my God,
6330000	6332000	like, if I could go back,
6332000	6334000	if I could go back to a time in
6334000	6336000	gaming history, I would
6336000	6338000	not go back to the NES or the
6338000	6340000	Atari 2600. I would not go back to those days.
6340000	6342000	Because, look, I have a lot of love
6342000	6344000	in my heart for the Commodore 64 in all those
6344000	6346000	days. I love those days. But here's
6346000	6348000	where, you know what I'd go back to?
6348000	6350000	I would go back to when the PlayStation 4 was brand
6350000	6352000	new and people were streaming the most
6352000	6354000	wild shit on the playroom.
6354000	6356000	Because...
6356000	6358000	Because what is better
6358000	6360000	than having sex on stream,
6360000	6362000	having sex on stream while
6362000	6364000	augmented reality
6364000	6366000	robots stare at you and go, what the
6366000	6368000	fuck is going on? Like, what are they
6368000	6370000	doing?
6370000	6372000	They start walking on your back and shit.
6374000	6376000	Kaijuno says,
6376000	6378000	nah, before playroom we had poker on the
6378000	6380000	PlayStation 2 and itoy TV.
6380000	6382000	I forgot, yo.
6382000	6384000	People could do that on the Xbox 360
6384000	6386000	with Uno. I remember that was the thing.
6386000	6388000	I'll show you Draw4.
6388000	6390000	Yes, I remember when we used
6390000	6392000	the itoy for streaming our
6392000	6394000	channel.
6394000	6396000	Did we use an itoy camera to broadcast
6396000	6398000	like the 30 second update
6398000	6400000	clips? Yes, we used to do
6400000	6402000	that because, and then we also, we
6402000	6404000	streamed playing that stupid washing
6404000	6406000	windows game that they had on there.
6406000	6408000	Remember that? Itoy play.
6408000	6410000	Yeah, itoy play. Remember that dumb little song
6410000	6412000	where now I'm washing windows.
6412000	6414000	Yes.
6414000	6416000	Yes.
6416000	6418000	We used to do that.
6418000	6420000	Why is it so funny? I don't know.
6420000	6422000	It was stupid, but it worked.
6422000	6424000	I just want to
6424000	6426000	come out with a very serious note here, and this isn't
6426000	6428000	funny. We shouldn't laugh at this when it comes to porn,
6428000	6430000	but it's worth talking about.
6430000	6432000	YouTube has a huge problem of people
6432000	6434000	trying to get porn on YouTube kids.
6434000	6436000	That's gross. Very sick people
6436000	6438000	try to do this. I see this as the same thing.
6438000	6440000	And you know, bringing us back to Earth
6440000	6442000	a little bit here. Yeah, I mean there's a lot of kids
6442000	6444000	that look for Fortnite type of streams too.
6444000	6446000	So even though we might be having, you know,
6446000	6448000	a laugh at the people doing porn, if kids
6448000	6450000	find it, it isn't really that funny. Although
6450000	6452000	parents should be watching what their kids are
6452000	6454000	clicking on. And also, they don't have a Twitch
6454000	6456000	Kids or anything like that, and I would see a lot
6456000	6458000	of streamers out there probably language wise
6458000	6460000	wouldn't necessarily be, you know,
6460000	6462000	friendly for kids, so. Fair.
6462000	6464000	I would be, I wouldn't
6464000	6466000	let my kids go on Twitch probably.
6466000	6468000	Yeah, like unsupervised for sure.
6468000	6470000	I mean, the crap that my son watches
6470000	6472000	most of the time, like
6472000	6474000	I swear to God, it's
6474000	6476000	fucking Roblox and the guys
6476000	6478000	talking about gold diggers all the fucking
6478000	6480000	time and how there's like women
6480000	6482000	on there that are trying to get Robux
6482000	6484000	or, I don't know what the fuck these people
6484000	6486000	are talking about, but like, why are you
6486000	6488000	talking about gold diggers? You don't fucking know anything
6488000	6490000	about what you're talking about.
6490000	6492000	Now Questbuster says that's probably why Ninja was
6492000	6494000	really upset. He knows his audience and having that
6494000	6496000	on his former channel on Twitch was not
6496000	6498000	a good look. Right, because
6498000	6500000	a lot of people might not know that he moved to
6500000	6502000	Mixer, and they're like, well, why is Ninja
6502000	6504000	streaming porn on his channel?
6504000	6506000	Even though it's not, it's like a
6506000	6508000	recommend feed for somebody else, but like
6508000	6510000	you know, people don't read into anything.
6510000	6512000	Why couldn't he just be a little more shady about it?
6512000	6514000	Why couldn't he just be like, well, now you know why I left Twitch.
6514000	6516000	Like, why couldn't he just be shady?
6516000	6518000	You know, seriously though,
6518000	6520000	that is a conversation that a lot
6520000	6522000	of people are having right now about
6522000	6524000	the unfair
6524000	6526000	treatment between, like, some people
6526000	6528000	on the platform are getting better treatment than other
6528000	6530000	people on the platform, and
6530000	6532000	for some reason recently, like, people
6532000	6534000	just abusing their pets.
6534000	6536000	I don't know why this is a trend.
6536000	6538000	Oh, can we not? Because like, oh my
6538000	6540000	god, like, I get more upset about
6540000	6542000	like the girl that threw the cat on the floor
6542000	6544000	and all this. I get more upset about that than like
6544000	6546000	people. Oh no, it's not
6546000	6548000	even, it's not even that, but like, there's
6548000	6550000	another one, it was
6550000	6552000	they put their dog in a dryer
6552000	6554000	and turned it on. No, I don't want to hear it.
6554000	6556000	It's gross, disgusting. But yeah, I don't know
6556000	6558000	what's wrong with people. People are
6558000	6560000	fucked up, and they shouldn't be streaming that shit.
6560000	6562000	No, absolutely not. Gross.
6562000	6564000	Oh my god, like, there's a special
6564000	6566000	place for you in hell when that all
6566000	6568000	oh, I've just discussed it. Why would people
6568000	6570000	Can we move on please? Yes, move on.
6570000	6572000	Yes, please. And honestly, sadly
6572000	6574000	this is not a great story to move on to,
6574000	6576000	but it's just the way the story has landed this week, so
6576000	6578000	Yes, it is. Let's get more upset.
6578000	6580000	So let's talk about how people are being
6580000	6582000	man babies again, so
6582000	6584000	you know,
6584000	6586000	apparently Twitch
6586000	6588000	employees are getting threats
6588000	6590000	and now the
6590000	6592000	police are involved, so
6592000	6594000	apparently they've been having
6594000	6596000	there's been a serious threat made against
6596000	6598000	our San Francisco HQ on Tuesday
6598000	6600000	and have been working directly with law
6600000	6602000	enforcement as they investigate.
6602000	6604000	The safety and security of our employees
6604000	6606000	is top priority, and we are focused
6606000	6608000	on ensuring this is resolved quickly
6608000	6610000	and safely, and to help
6610000	6612000	with that, they're having employees actually
6612000	6614000	work from home.
6614000	6616000	They didn't say exactly what
6616000	6618000	the
6618000	6620000	threat was, which is probably fine
6620000	6622000	because they don't want copycats, but
6622000	6624000	that, you know, the fact that you're
6624000	6626000	there's an active threat against a platform
6626000	6628000	or a company, and like, you know,
6628000	6630000	I'm assuming too, the serious threat, like, we're gonna
6630000	6632000	come in and shoot up your building or something like that.
6632000	6634000	You gotta take that so seriously. I mean, like,
6634000	6636000	not even a few months ago
6636000	6638000	this happened in YouTube.
6638000	6640000	Of course, you don't, you don't say, like,
6640000	6642000	what is the number one thing
6642000	6644000	that, like, in the biggest font when you're going through the
6644000	6646000	TSA at the airport, don't even
6646000	6648000	joke, right? Like, that's like,
6648000	6650000	like, don't, don't even joke because it
6650000	6652000	ain't funny, you know, and it's the
6652000	6654000	same thing with these
6654000	6656000	threats people are calling into
6656000	6658000	Twitch and all this stuff.
6658000	6660000	You know, it's not funny. Yeah.
6660000	6662000	It's very serious in this, especially in this world
6662000	6664000	that we live in. It's gross.
6664000	6666000	This is why we need to bring back
6666000	6668000	spanking. They need to find
6668000	6670000	this person and they need to spank them.
6670000	6672000	Like, it's just, it's
6672000	6674000	like the little child that they are with
6674000	6676000	this little,
6676000	6678000	it's just disgusting. Yeah. I think it's so
6678000	6680000	gross. All right.
6680000	6682000	Anyhow, I hope they find
6682000	6684000	the person and my hearts go out
6684000	6686000	to the Twitch people that were probably, honestly, with
6686000	6688000	everything else going on in the world, we're probably
6688000	6690000	shook by this, you know, like,
6690000	6694000	I got nothing else to say.
6694000	6696000	Let's move on.
6696000	6698000	Let's do, can we do something lighthearted, please?
6698000	6700000	How about a rumor? How about a good old
6700000	6702000	gaming rumor? All right. Good.
6702000	6704000	When we need to, when we need to lighten
6704000	6706000	the tone a little bit, let's do, either we get Mr. Smoosh
6706000	6708000	on camera, but that's his choice, or
6708000	6710000	we talk about gaming rumors. So,
6710000	6712000	let's talk about a
6712000	6714000	patent that was filed by Microsoft recently
6714000	6716000	to turn your smartphone
6716000	6718000	into a gaming device.
6718000	6720000	Huh. That's kind of interesting.
6720000	6722000	So, there was a patent that was put in last month,
6722000	6724000	and it's actually
6724000	6726000	detailing a charging device
6726000	6728000	for removable input modules.
6728000	6730000	So, the patent isn't for this controller,
6730000	6732000	but you can kind of see this controller in the mock-ups.
6732000	6734000	So, basically, imagine
6734000	6736000	I were to take my cell phone,
6736000	6738000	okay, and I would actually plug in,
6738000	6740000	think like Switch-style joy-cons
6740000	6742000	on the left side and the right side,
6742000	6744000	but something that a little bit more resembled
6744000	6746000	a Xbox One
6746000	6748000	gamepad. That's kind of what
6748000	6750000	it looks like for those of you that haven't seen the visuals
6750000	6752000	yet. And there would be, of course,
6752000	6754000	a number of color options in this patent,
6754000	6756000	two halves of a controller,
6756000	6758000	it clips around your smartphone.
6758000	6760000	So, you know, and again, companies
6760000	6762000	file patents all the time that they don't even use,
6762000	6764000	so it may mean nothing, but
6764000	6766000	what do we know?
6766000	6768000	Microsoft's going to be making a big push into
6768000	6770000	cloud streaming and all that stuff, right?
6770000	6772000	Microsoft doesn't exactly have the Windows phone
6772000	6774000	stuff, really, like they used to have,
6774000	6776000	so it makes sense for them to partner up with Android
6776000	6778000	and iOS,
6778000	6780000	which Apple has
6780000	6782000	really been, Google to some extent, too, has really
6782000	6784000	been lacking some type of official gaming
6784000	6786000	controller that could really make
6786000	6788000	things more playable on those
6788000	6790000	screens, right, because everything on those
6790000	6792000	systems is touch, which is fine
6792000	6794000	when the games are designed for touch,
6794000	6796000	like Pokemon Go or something,
6796000	6798000	but Xbox 360 and
6798000	6800000	Xbox One games are not designed for touch,
6800000	6802000	so it makes sense that you would have this little controller
6802000	6804000	or whatever, but I gotta
6804000	6806000	say, if this ends up being true,
6806000	6808000	what a clever little idea on
6808000	6810000	Microsoft's part to basically,
6810000	6812000	because it's going to be a lot cheaper than selling you
6812000	6814000	something like a PlayStation Vita. This is not
6814000	6816000	a PlayStation Vita, this is almost
6816000	6818000	certainly something that's going to tie
6818000	6820000	into xCloud and
6820000	6822000	Microsoft's streaming services
6822000	6824000	to allow you to play Xbox One
6824000	6826000	games and others like that.
6826000	6828000	Not even that, or just streaming from your
6828000	6830000	console, well yeah, I remember that xCloud was
6830000	6832000	also the streaming from console, kind of like
6832000	6834000	how they did with the remote play stuff, but
6834000	6836000	you know, something similar,
6836000	6838000	sounds like.
6838000	6840000	Yeah, so anyway,
6840000	6842000	and it should be noted that some of
6842000	6844000	the designs we're seeing out there are mockups
6844000	6846000	and so forth, they are not,
6846000	6848000	they're based on the patents, but they're not necessarily
6848000	6850000	from the patents, so please be careful
6850000	6852000	with what you see out there.
6852000	6854000	However, it is very,
6854000	6856000	sorry, I have coughs,
6856000	6858000	it is very interesting that Microsoft
6858000	6860000	is looking at doing this, it makes a lot of sense
6860000	6862000	for what could their direction be
6862000	6864000	when it comes to the cloud and all this,
6864000	6866000	you know, and how they're going to
6866000	6868000	solve the issue of gaming on the go,
6868000	6870000	but not necessarily like, you know,
6870000	6872000	on your
6872000	6874000	phone, but with your phone. Yeah, it's not like
6874000	6876000	a dedicated device, it's just
6876000	6878000	you know, its own
6878000	6880000	thing that can attach to tablets. So
6880000	6882000	SJ100Matt points out that Asus has a phone that's
6882000	6884000	almost like this, it's a gaming cell phone, it's
6884000	6886000	called the Asus ROG.
6886000	6888000	You know, and he says
6888000	6890000	it's pretty amazing, and I bet it is pretty amazing, but
6890000	6892000	still, also interesting
6892000	6894000	in a way, I think, that you know, if you get
6894000	6896000	Microsoft and something of that caliber
6896000	6898000	behind this, and Microsoft says, this
6898000	6900000	is the solution we are endorsing, so you can
6900000	6902000	play Halo, you can play
6902000	6904000	Sea of Thieves, you can play whatever
6904000	6906000	on Project
6906000	6908000	Scorpio and all this stuff, you know,
6908000	6910000	if they like roll this out at the same time, this could be very,
6910000	6912000	very big. And it's an
6912000	6914000	interesting way to kind of address
6914000	6916000	the Switch thing, like
6916000	6918000	playing it on your, but without
6918000	6920000	necessarily putting out a clone of the Switch.
6920000	6922000	Well, and eventually, when we get 5G
6922000	6924000	rolled out everywhere, and then you have
6924000	6926000	unlimited plans and stuff like that,
6926000	6928000	then it makes this type of gaming
6928000	6930000	feasible on the go.
6930000	6932000	Now, Dr. Tetsuya said earlier
6932000	6934000	in our chat, saying, I have to wonder if
6934000	6936000	Tommy Tallarico has heard about this, it sort of
6936000	6938000	sounds up the alley from what
6938000	6940000	he was looking into for extra Amico
6940000	6942000	controllers, that comment from our
6942000	6944000	Twitch channel at twitch.tv slash vognetwork
6944000	6946000	as we tape live here on Sunday night.
6946000	6948000	But, yeah.
6948000	6950000	Aren't we getting something Amico-related from
6950000	6952000	Gamescom as well?
6952000	6954000	Well, we know they were kind of at
6954000	6956000	E3, but we didn't get a lot out of that, besides
6956000	6958000	some of the console designs, which look pretty
6958000	6960000	hot, but I don't know if we know much about
6960000	6962000	the games yet, maybe we'll get some of that out of
6962000	6964000	Gamescom, but I still feel like Intellivision's a big
6964000	6966000	question mark on a lot of things, but
6966000	6968000	they're not out until, what was their day,
6968000	6970000	10-10-2020 or something like that was their big day.
6970000	6972000	So, they've still got over a year to go,
6972000	6974000	so I imagine we're not going to start seeing all the games
6974000	6976000	just yet, so. Oh!
6976000	6978000	Okay, Bobby's there to
6978000	6980000	correct me, as usual, saying
6980000	6982000	yes, the new trailer comes out at
6982000	6984000	Gamescom with 14 games
6984000	6986000	and the hardware, so apparently, I guess there was
6986000	6988000	an announcement, I didn't see it. So,
6988000	6990000	hmm, pretty cool.
6990000	6992000	Yeah. Yeah. Anyway.
6992000	6994000	Alright, so maybe
6994000	6996000	that's something that'll show up. Well, I didn't see
6996000	6998000	Intellivision on the list of who was showing up to
6998000	7000000	Jeff Keighley's thing, but I guess they probably want to do their own thing
7000000	7002000	if this is like the big reveal of the games.
7002000	7004000	So curious what kind of games they got.
7004000	7006000	So curious. I want to know if YYR
7006000	7008000	got in or not, because you know if he did,
7008000	7010000	he's not going to be able to talk about it even on this show.
7010000	7012000	So, I'm just crossing my fingers on my toes
7012000	7014000	for him, so. Alright, Bobby says
7014000	7016000	it was supposed to be August 1st, but they delayed it
7016000	7018000	to Gamescom. Well, that makes sense, you know.
7018000	7020000	Why not? Why not kick it off with a
7020000	7022000	big gaming show and show all of that?
7022000	7024000	Alright, we are almost
7024000	7026000	to your calls, if anybody wants to
7026000	7028000	call in tonight at our Discord server, vognetwork.com,
7028000	7030000	vognetwork.com slash
7030000	7032000	Discord, but we have a couple more stories
7032000	7034000	for you guys first, and Loki's about to
7034000	7036000	make me very upset. Yes,
7036000	7038000	isn't it so lovely how we talked
7038000	7040000	last week about how the 2019
7040000	7042000	E3
7042000	7044000	attendees, you know, they went there and had
7044000	7046000	all their information leaked and were like, see, this is
7046000	7048000	why we don't go to E3. This doesn't
7048000	7050000	affect us at all. And then they sent us a
7050000	7052000	fucking email saying, hey, guess what? Hey,
7052000	7054000	you went to E3 in 2006 or
7054000	7056000	2004, we leaked your shit too.
7056000	7058000	And wasn't I
7058000	7060000	like sitting here going, thank God we haven't been
7060000	7062000	in years and our stuff probably
7062000	7064000	and God damn it. Although,
7064000	7066000	I certainly wasn't
7066000	7068000	media in 2004. I was
7068000	7070000	a, we all went as guests of a
7070000	7072000	major gaming company, which if you think back
7072000	7074000	to what this show used to talk about
7074000	7076000	that many years ago, almost exclusively,
7076000	7078000	you can probably put two and two together
7078000	7080000	and figure out what gaming company
7080000	7082000	invited us, but that's neither here nor there.
7082000	7084000	2006, but 2006, I don't think
7084000	7086000	we went as media or did you get an email?
7086000	7088000	I got an email. Oh no,
7088000	7090000	I didn't get an email about that.
7090000	7092000	Oh my
7092000	7094000	God, I'm so mad. I don't remember. I thought
7094000	7096000	we went as just general attendees and registered
7096000	7098000	with the general public in 2005.
7098000	7100000	No, we went as media.
7100000	7102000	I mean, I
7102000	7104000	have to check. I've got my badges in the garage,
7104000	7106000	but yeah, no,
7106000	7108000	I'm just now I'm finding this out for the first time. I thought
7108000	7110000	we went as general. I didn't think we went as media until
7110000	7112000	the All Games years. Well, that was 2006.
7112000	7114000	After, no,
7114000	7116000	we weren't with All Games in 2006.
7116000	7118000	Were we? That was the
7118000	7120000	2006 one because that's, that
7120000	7122000	was Ridge Racer year.
7122000	7124000	2006. I thought
7124000	7126000	that came way later. No, that was the
7126000	7128000	year that they did the PS3 announcement.
7128000	7130000	Oh crap. Because
7130000	7132000	Oh, that's right.
7132000	7134000	Bobby says 2006 was the Arena
7134000	7136000	Interactive Lounge year. Fuck,
7136000	7138000	that's right. We were
7138000	7140000	media that year.
7140000	7142000	Oh no.
7142000	7144000	No, I'm fucking mad now.
7144000	7146000	I'm, well, my mailing
7146000	7148000	address is my old company that's closed down.
7148000	7150000	Yeah, all my information
7150000	7152000	is like dirt old. Like,
7152000	7154000	was I living with you in 2006?
7154000	7156000	Uh, yeah. Yeah, so like,
7156000	7158000	all that information is like dirt old by now.
7158000	7160000	It's not like it's my current address or anything, but it's still,
7160000	7162000	and I haven't gotten any like creepy, I think my phone
7162000	7164000	number might have been different too.
7164000	7166000	Oh yeah, because I probably registered with a home number
7166000	7168000	which I don't even have anymore, because we had a
7168000	7170000	home phone at that time, so yeah, that was probably
7170000	7172000	our business phone.
7172000	7174000	I want to say one year we like changed
7174000	7176000	the message to say something like, you're
7176000	7178000	calling OLR Studio. I feel
7178000	7180000	like that was the year we did all that.
7180000	7182000	So yeah, the good news
7182000	7184000	is that all the information is going to be shit anyway.
7184000	7186000	But it's still, it's
7186000	7188000	infuriating. So here's how they, it actually
7188000	7190000	leaked out. So it wasn't like someone hacked the
7190000	7192000	site and found anything. It was actually archived
7192000	7194000	by the internet archive.
7194000	7196000	And it was just floating around out there
7196000	7198000	for someone to access. If they access
7198000	7200000	the archive page, they can get the full list of
7200000	7202000	attendees from 2004 to 2006.
7202000	7204000	How nice.
7204000	7206000	Jason in chat says, old information is still
7206000	7208000	relevant for credit reports and
7208000	7210000	identity verifications, so, and
7210000	7212000	says sorry. No, I mean, you're just being a realist.
7212000	7214000	But that's like four or five addresses
7214000	7216000	ago, so. It was a long time ago, but
7216000	7218000	I mean, I'm not saying, oh it's
7218000	7220000	okay, I don't care, because the information
7220000	7222000	is so old. No, I'm
7222000	7224000	fucking pissed off about it, and the
7224000	7226000	ESA fucking sucks for what they did.
7226000	7228000	And, you know, fucking, I
7228000	7230000	hope there's a class action lawsuit and shit
7230000	7232000	because this is inexcusable what they
7232000	7234000	did. Like, please understand
7234000	7236000	me very fucking explicitly on this. I'm
7236000	7238000	not happy that this happened.
7238000	7240000	I'm really not happy. So here's
7240000	7242000	the statement that they put out in email. So it says
7242000	7244000	I don't, I kind of don't give a fuck, like
7244000	7246000	what they had to say, because it's, it's all it is
7246000	7248000	going to be talk. Less talk,
7248000	7250000	more action. Yeah, they're just blaming
7250000	7252000	their, well the files weren't hosted on the
7252000	7254000	servers or on the current website. We took
7254000	7256000	immediate action to remove those files.
7256000	7258000	They were cached on third party Internet Archive
7258000	7260000	site. We're working with our partners and
7260000	7262000	outside counsel, independent experts to investigate
7262000	7264000	what led to this situation to enhance
7264000	7266000	our security efforts.
7266000	7268000	So,
7268000	7270000	you know, what can
7270000	7272000	they do? I don't know, put any
7272000	7274000	security on there because there was literally none.
7274000	7276000	So, that's a start.
7276000	7278000	But, yeah.
7278000	7280000	So that was it, because I saw that
7280000	7282000	in my email. I'm like, uh,
7282000	7284000	why am I getting this?
7284000	7286000	So fucking mad. PixelPockets
7286000	7288000	in chat says ESA statements on this are
7288000	7290000	so eye rolling. They are at fault.
7290000	7292000	If the files were archived, they were
7292000	7294000	up on the site at some point because they put
7294000	7296000	them there. Sounds, and Bob Coffee says
7296000	7298000	sounds like PR bullshit. It is.
7298000	7300000	Nifty805
7300000	7302000	says Rob is ready to out rant Loki tonight.
7302000	7304000	I'm, yeah, I'm pissed about
7304000	7306000	this. This is way, this is way more
7306000	7308000	serious than, like, Nintendo not getting
7308000	7310000	online or whatever shit Loki rants about
7310000	7312000	in a week. Sorry, Loki. But this
7312000	7314000	is, like, this is far more important than
7314000	7316000	any of that. And it's, it's just,
7316000	7318000	it's so infuriating because, again, the ESA's
7318000	7320000	not really talking action. They're just
7320000	7322000	talking about, like, it's not our fault.
7322000	7324000	Like, it was, and it's just, like,
7324000	7326000	fucking accountability, bitch.
7326000	7328000	Like,
7328000	7330000	I'm so mad.
7330000	7332000	But what can you do? What can
7332000	7334000	you do? Like, you feel helpless about the whole
7334000	7336000	thing. It's like if this, the company's not leaking
7336000	7338000	your information, it's somebody else leaking
7338000	7340000	your credit information or whatever. It's, like,
7340000	7342000	why do we have credit
7342000	7344000	information anymore? It's just, it's all public
7344000	7346000	anyway, apparently. Yeah. So
7346000	7348000	ridiculous.
7348000	7350000	QuestBuster
7350000	7352000	and chat. ESA. So, we need to
7352000	7354000	spend money to secure this stuff. Just hide it in a
7354000	7356000	folder or something. Barf.
7356000	7358000	But I get it. It's
7358000	7360000	negligence. Absolutely. That's what I'm saying.
7360000	7362000	You're a fucking tech company. You
7362000	7364000	represent the tech industry.
7364000	7366000	Not a good look when you're supposed to be representing
7366000	7368000	the tech industry.
7368000	7370000	Anyway.
7370000	7372000	Let's move on to something a little more.
7372000	7374000	Let me find my happy place by listening
7374000	7376000	to some music. Okay?
7376000	7378000	So, let's talk a little bit about the Mana
7378000	7380000	series and, uh, the Mana
7380000	7382000	soundtracks, meaning, like, secret
7382000	7384000	of Mana or trials of Mana as
7384000	7386000	it is now. Square Enix has just
7386000	7388000	put 13 soundtracks
7388000	7390000	for the second Densetsu or
7390000	7392000	Mana series on several different
7392000	7394000	platforms including Apple Music,
7394000	7396000	Spotify, Amazon Music
7396000	7398000	and many more. Some of the
7398000	7400000	soundtracks that are out now. Second Densetsu
7400000	7402000	2, meaning Secret of Mana, the original
7402000	7404000	soundtrack. Second Densetsu 3
7404000	7406000	original soundtrack. Legend of Mana
7406000	7408000	original soundtrack. Heroes of Mana.
7408000	7410000	Rise of Mana. DS Children's of Mana.
7410000	7412000	I mean, just pretty much all the
7412000	7414000	second Densetsu and related Mana games you can think
7414000	7416000	of. All of those soundtracks going up on
7416000	7418000	Spotify and, uh, some great,
7418000	7420000	some great music, some great tunes.
7420000	7422000	So, um, a lot happier
7422000	7424000	of a note to end on tonight.
7424000	7426000	Well, I've got even better, uh, better
7426000	7428000	note to end on tonight. Oh, you got some last minute news,
7428000	7430000	do you? Yes. Well, good. I'll start bringing up Discord
7430000	7432000	to see if anybody wants to call in tonight while you get into that.
7432000	7434000	So, guess what game is getting a reboot?
7434000	7436000	A reboot. A reboot.
7436000	7438000	Okay, what? Cooking Mama.
7438000	7440000	Oh, that's kind of fun.
7440000	7442000	So, Cooking Mama's gonna be coming back to the
7442000	7444000	Nintendo Switch. That's what I
7444000	7446000	can tell the ESA. Don't worry.
7446000	7448000	Mama will fix it. Thanks to
7448000	7450000	Planet Digital Partners.
7450000	7452000	As part of this, they're gonna have a brand new
7452000	7454000	mode to go along with the regular recipes.
7454000	7456000	It's basically a vegetarian
7456000	7458000	mode. So, for people that don't want to
7458000	7460000	cook anything that has meat ingredients,
7460000	7462000	you won't have to. You can just switch to the
7462000	7464000	vegetarian mode and cook all
7464000	7466000	the vegetarian recipes. That's cute.
7466000	7468000	Yeah. For those that that's important
7468000	7470000	to them, that's cute. It's an easy
7470000	7472000	change to make, I suppose. Yep.
7472000	7474000	Yeah. So, that's it. No
7474000	7476000	word on when it's coming out yet, but
7476000	7478000	pretty
7478000	7480000	cool. I hope I say this name
7480000	7482000	right. I'm sorry if I mispronounced it.
7482000	7484000	Oh, in the fall. Oh, that's really
7484000	7486000	soon. Yeah. Sorry if I mispronounced this name.
7486000	7488000	Thower66. I'm sorry if I, or maybe
7488000	7490000	it's just Thor, but spelled differently.
7490000	7492000	I'm gonna say Thor. Thor66
7492000	7494000	in chat says, Dark Sakura should be happy.
7494000	7496000	I agreed. I'll have to let her know about
7496000	7498000	it. And by the way, I believe Thor66
7498000	7500000	in chat mentioned
7500000	7502000	that they've been listening since the All Games
7502000	7504000	days and, or, and even before that
7504000	7506000	on Life 365 and I guess just
7506000	7508000	rediscovered us here on Twitch. Yep. We're
7508000	7510000	still here. We're still here. A little older.
7510000	7512000	I got more gray, but we're here
7512000	7514000	and doing this video thing now that we've been doing
7514000	7516000	since December. So, um, yeah, it's
7516000	7518000	a whole new world out there with video, but
7518000	7520000	17 years, if you can believe it.
7520000	7522000	It's a long time.
7522000	7524000	Yeah. Almost as old as that ESA information
7524000	7526000	that's leaked out almost
7526000	7528000	past week. Jesus Christ.
7528000	7530000	All right. PixelPaca says, what about vegan
7530000	7532000	mama? Baby steps. Baby steps.
7532000	7534000	They're gonna have Beyond Meat in there.
7534000	7536000	Oh, maybe that's the hot new thing. I haven't tried
7536000	7538000	that yet. The Beyond Meat. Yeah.
7538000	7540000	That's beyond what I'm gonna try.
7540000	7542000	I hear it's pretty good. No. I'll try
7542000	7544000	it. What if it tastes like meat?
7544000	7546000	No. I'm curious. I'm curious.
7546000	7548000	But I heard, like, they're getting some crap.
7548000	7550000	It's a slippery slope. Like Burger King is
7550000	7552000	kind of getting crap because they cook it on the same grill that they
7552000	7554000	cook the meat on. So it's kind of
7554000	7556000	kind of defeats the purpose. Oh.
7556000	7558000	Oh, yeah. Yes.
7558000	7560000	That I get that. I thought
7560000	7562000	I was like, what, is it going to make the burgers taste bad or something?
7562000	7564000	Like, I don't understand the point is like, oh,
7564000	7566000	yeah. If you're vegan, if you're vegetarian
7566000	7568000	for, like, health reasons, what's that like?
7568000	7570000	That was like when McDonald's used to, like,
7570000	7572000	uh, fry their stuff in, like,
7572000	7574000	beef fat or something like that. They used to
7574000	7576000	have, like, some sort of, like, meat fat in there as
7576000	7578000	well. Yeah. Lard or something. I don't know.
7578000	7580000	Yeah. But their fries taste better then. I don't
7580000	7582000	know. Uh, Jason in our chat says
7582000	7584000	it doesn't taste like meat. It bleeds like meat.
7584000	7586000	Yeah, I heard that was a thing, too.
7586000	7588000	That it, like, actually will, like,
7588000	7590000	bleed. I guess, I don't know what, if it's beets
7590000	7592000	or something that it's using to make it look like
7592000	7594000	it's bleeding. Yeah. Gross, right?
7594000	7596000	But that's, yeah. Anyway.
7596000	7598000	Alright, let's move on.
7598000	7600000	Let's take some calls. We actually have somebody
7600000	7602000	in the green room over on our Discord
7602000	7604000	server, so let's get to a call tonight.
7604000	7606000	Hi, you are on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?
7608000	7610000	Hey, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
7610000	7612000	If you can hear me, we can't hear you. Hello.
7612000	7614000	Hey, what's up, buddy?
7614000	7616000	This is Act F. For some reason,
7616000	7618000	I couldn't hear you, but okay.
7618000	7620000	That's okay. We're here now. How you doing, Act F?
7620000	7622000	What's on your mind, buddy?
7622000	7624000	Well, there's lots and lots of my mind.
7624000	7626000	Especially with what happened
7626000	7628000	last weekend.
7628000	7630000	And how it happened, especially.
7632000	7634000	But, other than that,
7634000	7636000	you talked about
7636000	7638000	the Walmart story and
7638000	7640000	how they tried to
7640000	7642000	pretty much,
7642000	7644000	like,
7644000	7646000	don't know if they tried to fix
7646000	7648000	something, to try to do something
7648000	7650000	about it, but
7650000	7652000	it was the most
7652000	7654000	stupid
7654000	7656000	way to do it. Like, oh my god.
7656000	7658000	I'm actually, like,
7658000	7660000	angry about it.
7660000	7662000	Yeah, like, I'm irritated they're
7662000	7664000	buying into this narrative
7664000	7666000	that has no place
7666000	7668000	in the discussion anyway
7668000	7670000	when there is nothing to prove
7670000	7672000	that any of these, you know,
7672000	7674000	disgusting people that committed these acts
7674000	7676000	whose names I cannot recall,
7676000	7678000	nor do I wish to recall,
7678000	7680000	that these people were gamers
7680000	7682000	or playing video games or even influenced
7682000	7684000	by games. And even if they did play
7684000	7686000	a video game here and there, who
7686000	7688000	doesn't play video games here and there these days?
7688000	7690000	It's just, you know,
7690000	7692000	it's just, it's, again, it's a scapegoat.
7692000	7694000	Like, it's distracting from the real
7694000	7696000	issue. You can say the same thing about, like,
7696000	7698000	well, this person eats pizza, or the
7698000	7700000	killer ate pizza, therefore pizza
7700000	7702000	has caused him to kill. Exactly, exactly.
7702000	7704000	It's just trying to find, or they
7704000	7706000	ate Beyond Burgers, and, you know,
7706000	7708000	it's just... You hear that?
7708000	7710000	That's a cause I'm willing to give up.
7710000	7712000	Anyway, no, but, like, it's just,
7712000	7714000	it is gross, and it makes me angry, like,
7714000	7716000	as a gamer and somebody who's tried so
7716000	7718000	hard over the years to promote maybe, like, a more
7718000	7720000	positive gamer culture, and, like,
7720000	7722000	positivity in gaming, like, it's just, it's
7722000	7724000	really irritating to get
7724000	7726000	this kind of garbage. And I'm not
7726000	7728000	gonna say the gaming scene's already been, always
7728000	7730000	been perfect, but, like, this is garbage
7730000	7732000	stuff that we don't deserve to be
7732000	7734000	associated with, you know?
7734000	7736000	And, and, and especially because
7736000	7738000	I could probably talk about
7738000	7740000	the, the,
7740000	7742000	and this, this is the most
7742000	7744000	worrying thing about
7744000	7746000	how it happened, because it was
7746000	7748000	a racial thing. It was,
7748000	7750000	the...
7750000	7752000	I really don't wanna talk about it that
7752000	7754000	much, but... No, I get it. It's,
7754000	7756000	it's fucking infuriating, and
7756000	7758000	we get it. Like, we totally,
7758000	7760000	like, it's, I'm disgusted.
7760000	7762000	As, as, you're disgusted.
7762000	7764000	We're all disgusted. But, but, yeah, like,
7764000	7766000	always, oh,
7766000	7768000	video games have the, are the problem,
7768000	7770000	or this is the problem.
7770000	7772000	And they're not, no, nobody
7772000	7774000	is doing, like, at least
7774000	7776000	in, in the people who have the power,
7776000	7778000	who have the means, and,
7778000	7780000	and all that,
7780000	7782000	to do something, aren't doing anything.
7782000	7784000	Which is the most baffling.
7784000	7786000	It's like... It's very
7786000	7788000	simple. Video games do not
7788000	7790000	teach racism. That comes
7790000	7792000	from somewhere else. And
7792000	7794000	that El Paso attack was
7794000	7796000	racism.
7796000	7798000	Right? Yeah, definitely.
7798000	7800000	They didn't learn that in a video game.
7800000	7802000	I don't know. I did learn
7802000	7804000	that Skyrim is only for the Nords.
7804000	7806000	Not even the time to joke. Not
7806000	7808000	even the time. Like, it's just,
7808000	7810000	it's, it's, it's, like,
7810000	7812000	let's call it what it is. It was a racially
7812000	7814000	motivated attack that no
7814000	7816000	video game fucking taught them.
7816000	7818000	No, and,
7818000	7820000	and so many, and that's
7820000	7822000	a cool thing about the video game
7822000	7824000	community. Because that,
7824000	7826000	all that happened the
7826000	7828000	same time EVO was happening.
7828000	7830000	And so many people there were having
7830000	7832000	such a great time.
7832000	7834000	We even see, like, the
7834000	7836000	competition level, that
7836000	7838000	many people can get salty,
7838000	7840000	and probably get mad at the
7840000	7842000	other that they won,
7842000	7844000	they lost. But even
7844000	7846000	then, we have, like, people like
7846000	7848000	SonicFox and Goichi, if
7848000	7850000	anyone in, like, you or in chat
7850000	7852000	saw the Dragon Ball
7852000	7854000	Fighter finals. They were, like,
7854000	7856000	like, really
7856000	7858000	good pals from, like,
7858000	7860000	for many years. And they have probably
7860000	7862000	met, like, in the past two years.
7862000	7864000	And they were having a great time.
7864000	7866000	So many people there that
7866000	7868000	that were
7868000	7870000	for the games, and not because
7870000	7872000	oh, I'm better than you, and
7872000	7874000	or
7874000	7876000	other stupid stuff that can probably
7876000	7878000	trigger something like that.
7878000	7880000	But no, like, really
7880000	7882000	people have to
7882000	7884000	see the bigger picture, like,
7884000	7886000	at all, because
7886000	7888000	again, this is really frustrating
7888000	7890000	because it's coming from, like,
7890000	7892000	a sort of personal
7892000	7894000	thing, and
7894000	7896000	but, again, it's
7896000	7898000	like, people
7898000	7900000	and
7900000	7902000	you have to do something.
7902000	7904000	Call your representatives.
7904000	7906000	Like,
7906000	7908000	call for
7908000	7910000	something to be done
7910000	7912000	because
7912000	7914000	Walmart pulling, like, stuff
7914000	7916000	and again, it's just stupid stuff.
7916000	7918000	It's, again, frustrating that they did
7918000	7920000	that because, oh, my God,
7920000	7922000	it happened to
7922000	7924000	because of this, and maybe
7924000	7926000	because of this, not necessarily
7926000	7928000	because of it.
7928000	7930000	Yeah, you know, I'm fortunate that I live in a state
7930000	7932000	where we're represented by people
7932000	7934000	in Congress that are very much, like,
7934000	7936000	trying to
7936000	7938000	fight this and make something happen.
7938000	7940000	For example, one of our senators here
7940000	7942000	from California you may have heard of before,
7942000	7944000	her name's Kamala Harris, and she has lots
7944000	7946000	to say about these different issues. And again, I'm not
7946000	7948000	going to wade into politics because I understand,
7948000	7950000	but the reality is, like, you know,
7950000	7952000	I do feel like at least, you know,
7952000	7954000	but that doesn't mean I shouldn't call them and at least
7954000	7956000	kind of support in the direction that they're going,
7956000	7958000	but, you know, it is, it's like
7958000	7960000	we told the story about the governor that got
7960000	7962000	drowned out when he was trying to give the speech
7962000	7964000	to do something, and then finally, how about
7964000	7966000	that, it made it, it made an attempt,
7966000	7968000	there was an attempt
7968000	7970000	to do something, finally.
7970000	7972000	So, you know, it's that, it's really
7972000	7974000	pissed off people that are going to make the difference.
7974000	7976000	And, you know, as a gamer,
7976000	7978000	I'm sitting here, and I think a lot of us have to
7978000	7980000	sit here going, hell no, you're not
7980000	7982000	pinning this on us. This is not
7982000	7984000	our fault.
7984000	7986000	Period.
7986000	7988000	And, yeah, we, as
7988000	7990000	us people, even like
7990000	7992000	me living in Mexico, I have to,
7992000	7994000	at least I feel like the obligation
7994000	7996000	to do, like, something, at least
7996000	7998000	spread the word. But, yeah,
7998000	8000000	hopefully, things will get better.
8000000	8002000	Hopefully, I
8002000	8004000	want to be, like, really positive about it, but,
8004000	8006000	like, again,
8006000	8008000	this time was, like, wow,
8008000	8010000	I cannot even
8010000	8012000	fathom, I cannot imagine,
8012000	8014000	like, the horror,
8014000	8016000	the horror that people
8016000	8018000	that are like me
8018000	8020000	lived through that, like, oh my god.
8020000	8022000	At some point,
8022000	8024000	for what little relief it is, and I
8024000	8026000	mean little relief, at some
8026000	8028000	point, this generation
8028000	8030000	that has had to grow up with metal
8030000	8032000	detectors in schools, bulletproof
8032000	8034000	backpacks, drills
8034000	8036000	on what to do with an active shooter,
8036000	8038000	and things that I can't even
8038000	8040000	imagine going through. Like, I remember
8040000	8042000	the earthquake grill was the scariest thing I went
8042000	8044000	through when I was seven years old. Think about the
8044000	8046000	bullshit kids today have to deal with.
8046000	8048000	What little solace there is, is that
8048000	8050000	someday, that generation
8050000	8052000	that had to grow up with all that
8052000	8054000	bullshit is going to be the one
8054000	8056000	that is holding office
8056000	8058000	and making decisions. And do you
8058000	8060000	think that folks that are that young,
8060000	8062000	in fact, in general, folks
8062000	8064000	under 30, and I'm very much generalizing
8064000	8066000	because there's folks older than that,
8066000	8068000	like myself, that definitely agree
8068000	8070000	that something needs to be done, but the reality is, as
8070000	8072000	these younger folks that have had to grow
8072000	8074000	up in this culture and all this
8074000	8076000	bullshit around them is going to someday be
8076000	8078000	the ones in charge, things will
8078000	8080000	change. It's just
8080000	8082000	not changing fast enough,
8082000	8084000	unfortunately.
8084000	8086000	Yeah, we just have to wait,
8086000	8088000	be patient, and hope
8088000	8090000	for the best. That's definitely
8090000	8092000	the thing we can probably do
8092000	8094000	right now, but yeah, we need to
8094000	8096000	speak up. Like, not as gamers,
8096000	8098000	not as hobbyists,
8098000	8100000	but as people.
8100000	8102000	Absolutely.
8102000	8104000	I'm with you 100% on that.
8104000	8106000	Act Deaf. I'm glad it's something that, you know,
8106000	8108000	despite the fact that we are from two different countries,
8108000	8110000	it's something that kind of we can come together
8110000	8112000	and agree on. So, I appreciate your
8112000	8114000	call very much, my friend, so
8114000	8116000	take care. And hey, I
8116000	8118000	heard your podcast kind of made a move this week.
8118000	8120000	Yeah,
8120000	8122000	GFMcast, we're
8122000	8124000	sorry, we're still transmitting on
8124000	8126000	YouTube, but
8126000	8128000	since Google Hangouts is
8128000	8130000	just pretty much dead
8130000	8132000	for the most part,
8132000	8134000	we're doing some changes
8134000	8136000	and maybe in the future
8136000	8138000	we'll move to Twitch
8138000	8140000	too. It depends on how
8140000	8142000	YouTube acts in the following months, but
8142000	8144000	for now, we're
8144000	8146000	sticking to YouTube. You can
8146000	8148000	check us out if you like or you speak
8148000	8150000	Spanish.
8150000	8152000	Anyone, GFMcast or
8152000	8154000	JefemeCast on YouTube.
8154000	8156000	We also have GFMcast.com
8156000	8158000	so you can check out all our episodes.
8158000	8160000	All right. Wonderful. For our Spanish
8160000	8162000	speaking audience, I would highly recommend it
8162000	8164000	simply because I don't know anybody else
8164000	8166000	that does a Spanish speaking podcast that listens
8166000	8168000	to this show, and I really
8168000	8170000	wish I could listen and, you know,
8170000	8172000	be able to participate, but
8172000	8174000	all I can do is support you from a distance, my friend.
8174000	8176000	Hey, no problem. Thanks for the
8176000	8178000	plug. Yeah. Anytime.
8178000	8180000	Take care, buddy. You too.
8180000	8182000	All right. Well, that's the only
8182000	8184000	call that was waiting in the green room for us tonight,
8184000	8186000	so we're going to go ahead and probably
8186000	8188000	close down Discord at this point,
8188000	8190000	but thank you to ActDeft. If somebody else
8190000	8192000	decided they wanted to get in and got
8192000	8194000	a little shy or whatever and didn't end up calling
8194000	8196000	in, you can always send us an email, of course.
8196000	8198000	Participate at Orangelaungerator.com
8198000	8200000	or you can send us a tweet, Twitter.com
8200000	8202000	slash O-L-R. Those are
8202000	8204000	all great ways to contact the show
8204000	8206000	as well. Do we have any
8206000	8208000	last minute stories
8208000	8210000	as we start to wrap
8210000	8212000	up tonight? No, that was pretty much it.
8212000	8214000	Yeah, that was a big one. That's Cookie Mama's return.
8214000	8216000	That's a pretty big one. Later this fall,
8216000	8218000	so we'll have to see. All right. Then I guess
8218000	8220000	we will start to wrap up a little bit
8220000	8222000	here, so thank you, as always,
8222000	8224000	for joining us. Whether you are here live
8224000	8226000	on Twitch or listening on our podcast
8226000	8228000	feed or finding episodes
8228000	8230000	over at VoGnetwork.com.
8230000	8232000	Really appreciate
8232000	8234000	all the different ways
8234000	8236000	that you guys
8236000	8238000	participate with our show and
8238000	8240000	listen to us and support us.
8240000	8242000	All we say is, you know,
8242000	8244000	although we really appreciate the subs
8244000	8246000	here at VoGnetwork and the bitty
8246000	8248000	donations, the bits and all that, we
8248000	8250000	super appreciate all that. You know what?
8250000	8252000	All you really have to do, all we ask,
8252000	8254000	we don't need money, but
8254000	8256000	if you tell a friend or two about the show, help us
8256000	8258000	spread the word because we are the show where every gamer
8258000	8260000	has a voice, but, you know, if the voices aren't
8260000	8262000	here, if they're not in our Discord lobby waiting to call in
8262000	8264000	or in our chat room giving us feedback,
8264000	8266000	we can't put them out on the air. We can't have
8266000	8268000	that dialogue, so please
8268000	8270000	help us spread the word. Word of mouth is so, so
8270000	8272000	powerful. A nice five-star review
8272000	8274000	on a site like iTunes or wherever
8274000	8276000	you found this podcast. That stuff
8276000	8278000	goes a very long way. Yes, I know
8278000	8280000	we need to get on Spotify. We'll
8280000	8282000	work on that in the very near future.
8282000	8284000	In the meantime, though, it's about time
8284000	8286000	to wrap up, so I guess we'll
8286000	8288000	get around, go around and get everybody's final thoughts.
8288000	8290000	Um, I'll start tonight. So my final thought is
8290000	8292000	that Final Tribal Council's tomorrow
8292000	8294000	night of this 51-day game I've been
8294000	8296000	playing, and I'm just, I'm just,
8296000	8298000	cross your fingers, like
8298000	8300000	I would, I would really be honored to be the winner,
8300000	8302000	but if I'm not, then it wasn't in the cards
8302000	8304000	for that to happen. Are they supposed to have, like,
8304000	8306000	this livestream or something like that? It's all
8306000	8308000	going to be on YouTube, so I'll post the link to Twitter
8308000	8310000	if you guys want to see it and watch, watch me
8310000	8312000	get eaten alive by the jury and all that.
8312000	8314000	Although, like, I'm trying to think back.
8314000	8316000	At least, like, five of them,
8316000	8318000	I think, wait, I'm thinking back in my mind.
8318000	8320000	I think, like, five of them wrote my
8320000	8322000	name down at some point, so they can't be too upset.
8322000	8324000	But we'll see, we'll see how it goes.
8324000	8326000	Uh, so we'll see how the, um,
8326000	8328000	uh, Final Tribal goes tomorrow, but wish me luck.
8328000	8330000	Cross your fingers. If I win,
8330000	8332000	you know the, I told you the prize I get if I win, right?
8332000	8334000	No. Oh. Uh, if I win,
8334000	8336000	you get a blanket.
8336000	8338000	And the blanket can have
8338000	8340000	one of two things on it. You can have either the
8340000	8342000	logo for the season, so I would get
8342000	8344000	the, the power, because that's the name of the game,
8344000	8346000	is Power Org, so I would get the Power Org
8346000	8348000	logo on it, or the other option is to get
8348000	8350000	your face on it.
8350000	8352000	Now, Loki, you've known me a very long time.
8352000	8354000	Which of those two am I going to be getting if I win?
8354000	8356000	Oh, you're getting your face on it. I am absolutely getting the one with my face
8356000	8358000	on it, so, uh, you will hopefully
8358000	8360000	see that hanging here, if
8360000	8362000	I am successful tomorrow night.
8362000	8364000	Otherwise, uh, Felix
8364000	8366000	out in Montreal, who's the other finalist,
8366000	8368000	will get, I guess, I don't know if he's getting his
8368000	8370000	face or what, but one of us is going to get
8370000	8372000	that blanket, so we'll see what happens.
8372000	8374000	So, alright, that's my final thought.
8374000	8376000	Your final thought, Loki. My final thought is
8376000	8378000	I'm still working on trying to come up
8378000	8380000	with a game design for,
8380000	8382000	um, whatever I'm supposed to be
8382000	8384000	teaching kids about and stuff.
8384000	8386000	I actually had some pretty decent, um,
8386000	8388000	efforts on that, so we may see something
8388000	8390000	on there. I did work on my game a little bit this week.
8390000	8392000	Um, didn't get anywhere on that, because
8392000	8394000	I'm still trying to get,
8394000	8396000	I don't know, I had done this before
8396000	8398000	in, like, a previous game I made, where
8398000	8400000	I was, like, trying to lock the player to the
8400000	8402000	screen, but now
8402000	8404000	it's locking to the camera view, and
8404000	8406000	it's not right, so I
8406000	8408000	had to fix something in my code, because I can
8408000	8410000	scroll out of the screen if I drag
8410000	8412000	along the bottom, and it's not
8412000	8414000	supposed to be doing that. That would be a glitch,
8414000	8416000	so, um, still working
8416000	8418000	on that. Thank you for all the
8418000	8420000	love and chat, everybody. I'm feeling,
8420000	8422000	I'm feeling the love, so. Alright,
8422000	8424000	that's it. We're wrapped up for tonight.
8424000	8426000	We'll be back next week for, um, our
8426000	8428000	last live show of August, believe it or not,
8428000	8430000	uh, with Dark Soccer here in
8430000	8432000	studios, and then we're gonna be on a quick
8432000	8434000	little, we'll have a pre-taped
8434000	8436000	show again, uh, in two weeks
8436000	8438000	on August the 25th, because, again,
8438000	8440000	I'm flying out back east on the 24th,
8440000	8442000	and then Labor Day weekend, uh,
8442000	8444000	DragonCon will be going on, and we'll be hosting
8444000	8446000	their panels. I don't think we have anything on
8446000	8448000	Sunday night, maybe, I think there might have been a
8448000	8450000	Sunday 5.30 thing, I don't know, I don't think we have
8450000	8452000	anything, but, and I don't remember Bobby's
8452000	8454000	schedule off the top of my head, but there will be
8454000	8456000	some awesome panel that we'll be hosting that you
8456000	8458000	can see instead next week live on
8458000	8460000	Twitch, and for you podcast folk,
8460000	8462000	we'll be back, um, um, live
8462000	8464000	after that, uh, this, what, second
8464000	8466000	weekend of September, I guess at that point, so.
8466000	8468000	But we will be here next week, so don't,
8468000	8470000	like, you know, don't, don't make new plans yet.
8470000	8472000	We'll see you in seven days here on
8472000	8474000	Twitch, and you guys get to find out if
8474000	8476000	I won or not on that game.
8476000	8478000	I will, I'll actually get to play some more
8478000	8480000	video games this week. Maybe Loki will make
8480000	8482000	progress on his game, I don't know. Alright.
8482000	8484000	So, there you go. Uh, oh,
8484000	8486000	Bobby reminding me that we watch the
8486000	8488000	Masquerade and the VoG Suite on Sunday night
8488000	8490000	at the normal time, that's technically our
8490000	8492000	sweet party, you're right, that usually is kind of
8492000	8494000	what's going on at that time, but there'll
8494000	8496000	still be panels, like, podcasting,
8496000	8498000	or, excuse me, digital media tracks still has panels
8498000	8500000	that time, right? They might just do, that
8500000	8502000	might be some of their big ballroom panels, like
8502000	8504000	the, um, for
8504000	8506000	Truce and a Lie, I'm screwing up these
8506000	8508000	names of the shows, I'm sorry, there's that one
8508000	8510000	Truce and a Lie panel, Night Attack is
8510000	8512000	almost always there, they do something, and
8512000	8514000	so they'll probably be a big ballroom thing, who knows.
8514000	8516000	Anyway, yeah, Bobby says they'll have
8516000	8518000	panels, we just won't be on them. Got it.
8518000	8520000	Alright. Um,
8520000	8522000	that's it. I guess, I guess
8522000	8524000	we're done. Roll credits, right?
8524000	8526000	We'll see you guys in seven days. Good night.
