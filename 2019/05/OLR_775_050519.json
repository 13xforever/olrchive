{"text": " Orange Lounge Radio Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki This week, Microsoft defines some tolerable speech and MOBAs punish intolerable cheaters. If social issues are getting to be too much, why not use your Nintendo Switch to write a program instead? These are just some of the stories we'll discuss tonight, starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice. Orange Lounge Radio Hello, my friends out there on the internet. Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight with episode number 775 for this May the 5th of 2019. My name is Rob Roberts joining studio by the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers. Well, you're going to have to do something special for 777. I know. Well, you know, there was a there was a Bomani song because our show is rooted in, you know, music gaming culture. There's a Bomani song called 777. And I think the plan was always, oh, we're just going to play that song. But now it's holy. Well, and now we can't. So we might have to like record ourselves playing it and guitar freaks somehow and then like play that. I don't know. I don't know what you do or we do a Vegas themed thing. I don't know. We make it extra sinful. Golden casino night. Hello, Techmaster Loki, by the way. Hello, I'm here. The classic game of the week is Vegas Stakes by who did that? Was that how for Super Nintendo? I think it was the people that went on to make Smash Brothers all those years later. So that should be another character like, you know, one of the slot machines, the Vegas dude, the girl that comes up to try to loan you money or try to convince you to loan her money. And sometimes they pay you back and sometimes they run away with it. We'll just fight the Vegas showgirl and proteus over and over and over and over. I hope people know what I'm talking about in that game, by the way. It was kind of a niche, like Super Nintendo game, but I thought it was awesome. Anyway. OK, good. I'm not alone. Looking in our chat room over at twitch.tv slash vog network, where we do tape live every Sunday night at the voice keeps network vog network dot com right after the Bobby Black Wolf show. Six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern. OK, thank you. Vid Power says, yay, Vegas. I think that's just because the power is in Vegas. The break man, though, says, oh, shit, I love that game. And Bobby Blackwell says, I enjoyed Vegas Stakes. There you go. Hopefully, by the way, if you're listening to last week's show, you might have heard that we had some live audio issues going on, which, you know, say lovey things are going to happen. That's the year that that's why you all turn out for a live show. And we put it out on the podcast feed warts and all the way that we recorded it. So we had some mic issues. So hopefully you guys are going to find that those are gone tonight because Dark Soccer and myself have some brand new microphones. So we went out on a shopping adventure earlier this week and picked up some microphones. They probably look different on stream as well. So, you know, the other ones that we had before, they were great. They were hand me downs, though, from pod culture, which, you know, of course, we super appreciate that. But the reality is he had already used them for some time. Then we use them. We used them up. I mean, gosh, we were in the apartment when we started using those. That was like five years ago. So I think those mics were just on their last legs, except Techmaster Loki still has the last of those microphones because these microphones, I guess these microphones are 100. They were worried I'm going to break them day one. These microphones are one hundred dollars a pop. So it was kind of. To be honest, not a lot in the scope of mics. Yeah, no, honestly, we we were looking at some, you know, pretty high end mics. So but these I think are going to work for what we're going to do. And it was just one of those. All right. Well, maybe we can spend two hundred dollars, but three. Let's just let's hold off. So we're going to make sure these are good. We don't have any problems. And then we'll upgrade. And I went lusting after other mics. Yeah, you were looking at the fancy like like Lana Del Rey singing a sultry song into an old fashioned radio type of mic. You're like, I want to just live stream with it. Well, that's actually kind of what I'm thinking of doing, because Dan and I have been working on the live stream set up, but my office is an absolute wreck. And that and I have plans to do a podcast. I'll just go ahead and say that plans to do a podcast as a sister. One of the sisters of perpetual indulgence to kind of expand the ministry and spread love and positivity in a very geeky, draggy kind of way. Love and positivity. This is gamer culture. Fuck that bitch. Get good. I'll show you good. I'll be so fucking good. I'm going to spread so much goddamn love. Fuck y'all. Love everybody. Damn it. Stop being a shit. That's going to be my podcast is like. All right. Let's get into things that gamers need to love a little bit. Maybe. I don't know. I want to start this week's show with our kickoff topic before we get into our gaming weeks. Always like to bring up one topic to kind of start us off tonight. And this is one I think a lot of people are talking about this week. Right. So the Sonic the Hedgehog movie trailer came out this week and it was everything we would hope that it would have been. It got a reaction. Well, I don't know. Loki like you didn't seem so bothered by it. Tell it. Oh, it was good. I knew it was going to be terrible. Yeah. And so all I cared about was Jim Carrey. Jim Carrey was awesome. I'm sold. I'll see it even if it's garbage. OK. For those that don't know, Loki's name does not come from Loki Marvel or like some of the other uses. It comes from Loki mask like the mask with Jim Carrey, which is is that still like your all time favorite movie, you'd say? Oh, no. I thought it was like one of your. I mean, it's cool. I like the movie, but it's it's old. But so, yeah. Well, and now when I watched the Sonic movie trailer, you know, I was kind of like, all right, this just looks like it's for kids. You know, whatever. Like and I think a really good comparison was made on Twitter for me that like especially when it comes to. I think the big thing y'all know we're going to talk about is the look of Sonic the Hedgehog. Right. So I'm not everybody took too well to the look. But, you know, I think the first thing I said on Twitter was, well, you know what? It doesn't mean this movie is going to tank just because all the video gamers that grew up with Sonic are on Twitter going, what the hell did they do to Sonic? Because I'm like, you know what? Like movies that we don't always understand why they're successful do very well. And I was like, they've made how many movies out of those minions, which I think those things are. I don't get it. I haven't seen a single one and they annoy me. Granted, yes, the minions are annoying, but the like the actual story in the writing is actually pretty decent. Like if you just have to like, I don't know, it's all about the 60s, the set pieces. Well, in a response I got and I think this is from Flocko, I think. Sorry if I'm misappropriating that comment, but I think the reply I got and I thought this was a better comparison is he said he brought up the Smurfs and the Alvin and the Chipmunk movies. And I was like, oh yeah, those Alvin and Chipmunks look terrible, but like they've made three of those movies, at least two, because one of them opened up against like a Marvel movie or something. Right. But they'll keep making them because it's just like, you know, they're probably cheap to produce and they make money. It's just like why there's really bad action movies out there too, because they're cheap to produce and they make money. But that doesn't mean you have to make it terribly. And I understand that like, just because we don't like the look of Sonic doesn't mean that, well, it's okay, we're not the target demographic. No, that would be the argument that the story that they are laying out here is kind of dumb and doesn't follow the game. That would be that kind of argument, but the fact that it looks weird is a problem. But it could be the fact that like, okay, if all these people that had a say on the creative direction of Sonic, if all these people were saying, this may not be a good idea. Does that leave concerns about maybe the script isn't a good idea? I don't know. I mean, we're all, a lot of us are making snap decisions based on the trailer. You know, we don't know what the movie story or anything's going to be. And I guess when I watched the trailer, I was like, oh, they're making another Jim Carrey movie from the 1990s. And I'm down to bet. Actually, that's kind of awesome. I'm all for Jim Carrey having a 90s movie. I'm fine with it being a terrible movie, though. And let's be honest, there are some movies that have really good comedians in it, but they are probably pretty terrible. There was one, I don't even remember, I think there was another one with Jim Carrey, actually, with penguins or something like that, that there was something to that effect. I don't think I've seen that one. And then there was one I know, the Smurfs movies actually have Neil Patrick Harris. I'm like, I almost want to see it just because of that, but I never did see those. Looking in chat, DJ Rama S says, this movie may not be targeted at us, but for God's sake, Sonic should look damn near like his anime and gaming counterpart. Why not, though? Why not try to make it appeal to as many people as possible? That's just an excuse of saying, well, I'm sorry, we just didn't try that hard because we're only aiming at kids and kids don't give a shit. That's a terrible argument. That's just like, well, we wanted to pay the right, you know, that'd be like, imagine a Mario movie. OK, well, we can imagine a Mario movie that came out. Let's imagine a Mario movie outside of the 90s that came out where they're just like, eh, we don't fucking care because it's for kids, you know, and they just half-assed it. I will say this. There was a Super Mario Brothers anime that came out that was so freaking weird. Dan and I sat and watched it and it's like, why does this it had like nothing to do with any of the current canon. It was also weird, like having to rescue Peach's like boyfriend or something and weirdness. But weird Mario has been done before. And there is a Mario movie coming out, a new one. Yeah, by Illumination. Honestly, by the Despicable Me people. I got to seriously, I know if they have Charles Martinet, you need to seriously sit down and watch those movies. They're not that bad. They're actually pretty entertaining to watch. So like I have no problem with them doing a Mario movie. I think they'd be a great studio to do Mario movie because like anything Illumination has done has actually been pretty good. Even like a dog's was a life of pets or something like that. That's actually a pretty decent movie. Well, let me bring it back because I think many of you, I'm sure many of you that bother to watch a Twitch gaming show probably keep some sort of pulse on the gaming news and so forth that's going out there on Twitter and so forth. So I think you all know kind of the punch line that ends this is that because of all of that kind of negative reception that ended up happening on social media, on Twitter and Facebook and everything and just the memes, the redoing of Sonic and so forth. The director of the movie, Jeff Fowler, who is foul town on Twitter. I actually think that's kind of a funny Twitter handle handle foul town over on Twitter said thank you for the sport and the criticism. The message is loud and clear. You aren't happy with the design and you want changes. It's going to happen. Everyone at Paramount and Sega are fully committed to making this character the best he can be. Hashtag Sonic movie, hashtag gotta fix fast, which I thought was funny. Now, I do want to say every other article you've seen about they have to go back and redo this before the release date. They have so much they're doing that. This is this this tweet, this 280 character tweet is what's been said on the subject. Every other story, every other click article you saw on Facebook, every other thing you read about how they have to go back and fix the Sonic movie. I'm using my little quotey fingers. Every single one of those articles is based on this 200 character tweet. So I mean we can sit here and read between the lines too. But we don't know yet if this means release date pushback. We're assuming no. We don't know if this means ironically following up on crunch time after last week's show. If this means it's going to be crunch time for animators and so forth. I hope not. It's probably it would be crunch time for rendering is what I would think. But they've they can still film their principal photography stuff and then add it in later. Principal photography has been done since like the end of 2008. So they're not 2008. I'm sorry 2018. I'm sorry. That's why we're getting 90s Jim Carrey. They filmed it in the 90s. They actually filmed it in the 90s. It's authentic. You know what I meant. I'm sorry. We couldn't we couldn't we couldn't realize Sonic until the technology was there. They filmed it last year and he made dinosaurs come to life with Sonic the Hedgehog was an additional challenge. Fuck off. All right. You all know what I meant anyway. So I mean the thing is principal photography is done. James Marsden. Jim Carrey. They've all moved on to other things. I don't know what they've moved on to these other things. So I don't think I mean it is customary to maybe do reshoots here and there. But at the same time if they're if they're fixing this rendering character that was not part of the principal photography now anyway. I mean it doesn't seem like they need to actually do reshoots but I'm not a Hollywood magician. Like who who likes. I want to know who okayed this. Who said. Yeah that's good. I mean like who. No one's like that doesn't really look like it should. Something's wrong. Focus groups focus groups. I know you're going to you're going to look at me and make fun of me because I'm saying that. No I understand. I'm just answering the question that's presented. Who told them they could do that. Focus groups did. I'm not saying these focus groups knew dick about Sonic the Hedgehog or anything but to be fair in Hollywood they're not necessarily wanting to just attract gamers. They want to build something that they can get all sorts of families on and that they can sell toys at the end of the day. But it isn't even about selling video games about selling toys. But why would making Sonic look more like the character from the game detract from Sonic. That's why I don't understand like why making it look accurate would detract from people wanting to see the movie. I don't ever. That's never been. Sorry. This was better. So that's why it did work. Like it doesn't make any sense. Here's the thing. Like I'm not I'm not going to like disagree that he looks bad. He didn't. He doesn't look great but I'm not sure what fixing him at this point is going to do like if the movie is bad. You guys it's going to be bad no matter what I want it to be if it's going to be bad. I want it to be really bad because I think Sonic as it is now. I think if we just kept everything as it is now with the potential to be like so bad it's good type category like I kind of want to go there. But now it's going to be like better and stuff and I guess that's fine. But Tiger Claw on chat says actually an article on I.G.M. back in December. The producer Tim Miller did say that Sega was not happy with the eyes but they went with what we saw because they didn't want Sonic to look like a Pixar character. Bobby Blackwell fired up in our chat saying the focus groups probably weren't given the game as a reference. Yeah I also would like to know why. Why was it such a big deal that oh damn we don't want our animation to look like this really. Well you know this highly esteemed animation company. God forbid we make it look good. I think there's a fear looking forward that then all the reviews would say that it's a Pixar knockoff or something which I'm not. Again Loki I'm just answering the I put out there I'm not saying I necessarily agree with these things but I that's probably why they did that. And but I think we all sit here and know but everybody knows Sonic the Hedgehog goes back before. Was Pixar a thing in ninety one. What was the first Toy Story movie. Ninety four. So some predates. We'll say Pixar's legacy. If nothing else we know that Sonic predates. It just sounds like it. It sounds like they just happened. I don't know. Here's the other some I am sure someone worked really hard on it but. Yeah. Here's other kind of just interesting things I want to put out there about this whole debacle. One of them is the fact that you know whether the news be good or whether the news be bad. I am hearing more about this movie than any other movie that's coming out. Oh that's because Detective Pikachu comes out this week and I'm sure it'll be just all how amazing that is. Somebody was trying to tell me like what movies were opening the same weekend as Sonic and they were like oh there's a sequel to The Shining coming out. There's some new Emmerich movie and I'm like I'm like they're making. Why. Who's first. Who's making a sequel to The Shining and why. The second like I'm just like I I'm not hearing about any of these other movies and I know you know but not nothing that's being said is any good. Since when was bad publicity. Now I roll it a roll in Emmerich Sonic movie I'm down at that. I was going to say a roll in Emmerich movie. I'm like you want to talk about a movie we know is going to be bad. Come on. Roll in Emmerich movies are like Independence Day. The day after tomorrow when they're running from temperature is that. Independence Day was good. Everything after Independence Day was bad. Independence Day is a perfect example a perfect example of a movie that's bad to the level that it's good. Yes yes there was a lot of like hold your disbelief type things like yes that's. Hold on to your butts. No wait that was the Jurassic Park but another movie that's kind of it's kind of bad but it's good. Oh no it's gone. Yeah Jurassic Park has gone that way too. But yeah I mean I remember I didn't watch the last one that he did but I watched 2012. And like there's only so many times that a plane can take off from a runway when the earthquake is destroying the road. It happened three fucking times in the movie three times. I kind of agree. Whereas I'm I'm appreciative of this director seems to be wanting to listen to the feedback and all that stuff. I kind of want to see what the Emmerich Sonic movie would look like. A character that can literally outrun temperature I think would be pretty amazing. All right. But anyway let's talk about that fan backlash a little bit because I'm also trying to sit here and think of a time. And I'm sure maybe chatters know because I can't think of any a time that a trailer was so poorly received that they went back and are changing the movie because of it. This is kind of a big deal. I'm not sure about a trailer but I know like several movies had like major reshoots like and never ended up working out too well either. Like what of the Wolverine movie. The original Wolverine movie. Good old test audiences seeing the original ending of things. Little Shepherd Horrors. Because they had the original Plants When ending with the don't feed the plants that was in the stage play. And they went back and it tested so poorly that they went back and did a happy ending. But it's interesting that this is something that has become more and more prevalent in gamer culture. Like I know we're spending a lot of time talking about a movie that just happens to be based on a game. But let's be real. Fan backlashes. This is like the new norm in gaming culture. And I'm not completely sure how I feel about it. Obviously the most well known circumstance of this would be Mass Effect 3's original ending. And Jamie I know that's a game near and dear to your heart as well. I liked the new endings. It's interesting because there's a part of me that's like let the art just be the art and let it be. And when I saw the original endings, because I did beat the game originally before the extended endings. I was like it's not that bad. I understand why people were irritated because they felt that the decisions they made were not really reflected in the ending. But at the time I was kind of sitting there going well I feel like there's only so much you could do with it. So like you can't wrap up every single story. Like there's just so many branching paths at this point. Like I don't know how else you would wrap it up besides an ending that spoiler alert for a video game that's very old at this point. Either destroys the entire universe or synthesizes or you know the various endings at the end of Mass Effect 3. So it's interesting they went back and did it but I'm kind of with you Jamie. After seeing what they did with those remade endings I was like oh well I like what they did with that. I think these are even more impactful now. I know a lot of the hardcore fans hate the synthesis ending because of the unwillingness of merging the technology. However, you can hate that ending all you want. I would still argue it's very well done. Like just with Trisha Helfer's narration is amazing in that ending. I thought it was well done. It's just not the choice that I make. Sure, sure. You're allowed to have your head canon. That's part of the fun of Mass Effect, right? Honestly, the only one I choose is the one that has a chance of having my femme shut back. Yeah. So anyway, but I remember at the time that that all happened I was like, you know. The creators of Final Fantasy 7 should be so happy that the internet did not exist. I mean the internet was there but it was very dial up and prodigy AOL. It wasn't as prevalent in your pocket on your mobile phone as it is today. Like the creators of Final Fantasy 7 should be so happy that people were not able to make a fuss like they were back then. Which has me so curious how they're going to do this remake. Because I don't know if you guys all remember but the ending to Final Fantasy 7 is not great. Like it's not great. Especially considering all the effort you put into that game and everything. Like the ending, the payoff. I mean the story in that game doesn't make the most sense as it is. And the ending just kind of like further complicates that. You know what I mean? Yeah. So it's going to be interesting to see how that all plays out. Do you think there will be a DLC remake or something? I don't know. A DLC ending? Anyway, going to chat for some more comments. Kaijuto says, like I said, gamers don't know what they want. They have to stop bending to everything gamers complain about and just think outside the box and create. SSJ100Matt talking about reshoots saying Back to the Future had to reshoot most of the movie. Because of Jason Bateman, wasn't it? It wasn't Jason Bateman. It was somebody else. I thought it was Jason Bateman. No, but it was someone along those lines. Like one of those. Yeah, it was another 80's teen guy. But yeah, the original audiences didn't respond well. I thought they replaced him. I didn't think they shot the whole movie. They'd done some significant shooting but they hadn't shot the whole movie. Which movie? Back to the Future. Eric Stoltz. That's it. It was Eric Stoltz. Yes, that was it. Eric Stoltz. Because I kept seeing the movie he was in with Cher in my head and I was like, I know who it is, I know who it is. And Bobby clarifies it was two weeks, not the whole movie. But still a pretty significant amount of time. Very infamously, Star Trek Voyager shot without Catherine Janeway. Without Kate Mulgrew. Well actually the character's original name I think was Nicole. I think even the captain had a different name. I think it was Nicole Janeway and it was that French actress Genevieve Bejold. And you can see some of her scenes on the Blu-ray because I've seen it and she's not great. Like you could kind of tell she didn't really want to be there. So I mean it kind of worked out because Kate Mulgrew is like legendary in that role. But that's a little different because audiences I don't think had as much to do with that. As maybe this is a circumstance where Hollywood and producers and things like that kind of sat in the boardroom and looked at it and made the right call. Like when they looked at that footage they said she is not right for this part. And got the person that they had second in mind, Columbo's wife. Which ended up being an epic Star Trek captain. So some other just quick reshoot things you may or may not have known about. Bobby Blackwell pointing out the Matrix Reloaded had to reshoot after Alia died. That's right. Alia was the role that was played by what's his name's daughter ended up doing it. I thought it was Jada Smith. No it wasn't that role. It was somebody famous' daughter that ended up doing it. You know the Matrix better. Who was Alia originally supposed to play in the Matrix Reloaded? It was not Jada Pinkett's character. It was somebody else. Was it Trinity? No it wasn't Trinity. No? Specifically in Reloaded. But anyway. I don't remember. No. Queen of the Damned was actually released. Z. That was Z. Z was the character in the movie. Yeah I don't remember. The interesting thing about Jada Pinkett's role is that she was the star of the game. And they kind of incorporated that into the movie. Right? Because the game had Jada Pinkett and that other character. No it wasn't her. It wasn't her as the main character in the game. I thought she was like the main character in the game. No it was. I remember. Maybe it was. That's it. Nona Gaye. It was Marvin Gaye's daughter. Or granddaughter maybe. So anyway. I'm trying to remember who the characters were that were in the game. Thank you Bobby for getting the Wikipedia article faster than I could. I don't remember. I played a lot of it though. Let's see. There was another good reshoot comment here. So Bobby also pointing out about reshoots after the trailer. World War Z had some reshoots after the trailer. S.J. 100 Matt saying didn't Passion of the Christ get toned down after the fact? Oh it was Niobe. I forgot that she was one of the main characters in that. So with the Passion of the Christ that was an interesting one too. Because that movie was very violent. But it was very religious. It was very anti-Semitic. Well I'm going to keep it to just the information. The trailer is full of spoilers. Anyway. Sorry the book was better. Here's the thing is that they because of the fact that there was many religious people interested in seeing the movie. Who had concerns about the violence. They released a PG-13 version of the movie. Which is not the first time they've done that. Sometimes our movies get a PG-13 version exactly for that reason. To try to expand who can kind of go see it. Wasn't the original cut of Deadpool supposed to be raunchier? Deadpool 2 had that holiday version that was PG-13. So that's the most recent example of that. I want to say that Aliens had to be toned down a bit too. Or how about this for Kill Bill volume 1. In Japan the big fight scene in the House of Blue Leaves was in color and longer. And they made it black and white for the US one even though it's like piles of fake blood. But for some censorship thing to lower the rating. I have the DVD of the Japanese one. And honestly the fight's a lot better in color. I think the anime sequence was altered somehow too. I don't remember it being. I'd have to watch the two of them again. I don't even think it was in the Japanese version. I think it was something Tarantino commented on. I'm irritated. He's kind of come out and said he's not going to end up doing a volume 3 or 4. Which is sad. Anyway, we got off track a little bit. Because I really wanted to talk about fan backlashes. But let me ask this question. Let me wrap on this question then we'll move on to our gaming weeks. Because I know we've talked about this for a little bit. Kind of going down memory lane a little bit. Do you think this fan backlash to Sonic is a good trend or a bad trend? Because I want to watch how I'm wording this. Because I don't want you guys to answer the question about what it means for Sonic. I want you guys to answer the question. Is it a good precedent that Hollywood is now willing to change somebody's artistic vision based on the feedback? It's ultimately up to whoever is making the content to make that decision whether they want to change it or not. I don't think it's a bad trend that people are letting them know what their opinions are. That's why we have social media. They want to act on it. They can act on it. That's independent from the people criticizing it. I don't think under any... we should not expect them to change it just because we complain about it. But that they're going to do it. That's cool. I mean that's in their best interest because that's going to get more people interested in it. But that's ultimately their call and I don't think they should blame the backlash on it. Maybe consider when you're putting out the trailer, make sure that you're showing your best work. And to be fair, that's not to say that this isn't their fault that they're not showing their best work. But there's been several times where I think Sony Pictures or maybe Universal or something sends out trailers without music in them sometimes. They fuck up in that sense where like, dude, I can't believe you did that once and then I can't believe you did that a second time. But yeah, I mean you're marketing a product. You've got to make sure that if something looks weird, people are going to call you out on it. I'm going to comments from chat. Bobby Black Wolf, bad trend. I said the same thing about Mass Effect 3's ending. Kajudo, bad trend. 100%. Bonds 006. I don't want the retooling. I don't want it to be a trend. Tiger Claw says, they're not going to completely change Sonic. Mark my word. They have a plan B. Believe it or not, you guys, mark the date and time. I kind of agree with Tiger Claw here. No tea, no shade. But here's the thing. I don't know so much about the plan B. I don't think they already have rendered footage that exists of something else. They probably have concept art, sure. They have a lot of concepts. But here's the thing. I think the part of his comment where he says, they're not going to change it as much as y'all think they are. I agree with that 100%. I don't think it's going to be this drastic retooling of Sonic. Maybe they'll take his teeth out. One thing to consider is that the animation has been done. All they have to do is reskin the frame. That's all they have to do. You know, maybe tweak animation like on the eyes or something if they do give them the more, you know, game style visage, you know. But the animation is done. The frames are done. There's not going to be a whole lot of tweaking people have to do other than a reskin pretty much. So it's not going to be that thing. But the other thing too is that however it's going to take, they shouldn't rush it. They really need to take their time and do it right. I do agree with that. I think I'm kind of like have these with you because I think when it comes to like maybe the clips of him running or the clips of like I don't think those are necessarily going to need to be changed a lot. But I think because of that, there's a certain structure to Sonic that is just going to have to stay the same. Like maybe they can change some of the stuff when he's there talking and they're doing some close up shots and things like that. But I just think there's like because I don't think they're gonna have time to go back and do all the, you know, chase sequences or whatever. I think there's a certain frame of his they're going to have to stick with. It's too far gone. They need to make it worse. I want to make him even taller. His legs even like wider or skinnier or whatever. Just make it worse. I want it to be worse. As you know, under Matt says it's a new Coke scheme. Tweak it a little bit and come off like they care about the original subject matter. Now here's the question. Will the Blu ray have the original Sonic scenes? I want to be able to flip between the two. All right. Look, I've spent enough time talking about that movie. Like I said, I can't think of any other movie now that Avengers is coming on and Captain Marvel's coming on. I can't think of any other movie this year that's getting as much talk right now. So there's that even Detective Pikachu. Now, don't get me wrong. There's a lot of talk about that. And it sounds like it's going to be great. Some of the early reviews are saying it doesn't suck. Like I'm not seeing five stars, but I'm seeing as far as video game movies go. Not bad. I'm seeing it on Saturday. I want to see it too. For sure. I definitely want to see Detective Pikachu, but I'll probably go see the Sonic movie too. I'm seeing that for sure. Absolutely. Honestly, I just want to see the Jim Carrey 90s stuff. And oh, it's about Sonic the Hedgehog. I fully, I fully support that movie. And if you don't believe me, go look at my Twitter. All right. Anyway, moving on. Let's get into our gaming weeks and the types of games we have been playing this week. Maybe, maybe somebody has been playing Sonic the Hedgehog in memory. I don't know. Dark Saga, we'll start with you. How was your gaming week? It was uneventful. I've had a very, very busy week. I'm playing lots of Animal Crossing. I got the DJ KK booth and that makes me really happy. I'm still playing Idle Poring. I kind of don't know if I want to keep playing it. Just because, I don't know, I'm not getting any further in the game and I'm just kind of bored with it. Right now I'm playing it out of this weird sense of obligation. I've been playing Ingress a little bit. Just trying to gather equipment for the event. We got, I don't know if I said it last week, I don't know if we had it by then, but we have a Doctor Who pinball now. You did mention it last week. And on camera, if you look in a minute, I'm going to put up one of the plastics that Dan gave me of a Dalek. It's a broken one, but it hangs out in my purse now so I can put it in my cube at work. But I've been playing actually quite a bit more of that because it has one of the best multi-balls ever. But, I mean, really not a whole lot. It's been kind of a work week for me so it's been mostly doing web design stuff. That's it. Fair enough. Loki, how about you? How was your gaming week? I didn't play a lot of games this week. I played mainly just Pokemon Go. I've been really bad. I've not played my DDR cabinet in a while. I'm hoping to change that this week. I've been busy with work stuff, so I've actually been doing work at home on top of work at work. So, yeah. That's my excuse. This week, though, my wife has gone the entire week on business and stuff, so that means I can stream video games! And so I have to figure out what I'm going to do, but maybe we'll do some of that this week. And then I did work on my game a bit more as well, making very small progress on that. And then I also, because I've been waiting to get something for my PC for a while now, so I finally decided to purchase an Oculus Rift desk. So I have that pre-ordered now. So you got in on that, because I heard that Bobby went into a little more depth on his show tonight about that. Which is funny, because I think we had so many news stories to talk about. I don't think I actually put it on our show roll. We can talk about it now. That was announced and sold out like that. And you're one of them. Yeah, I didn't realize that they sold out. I just know that they're shipping by the end of the month, is what it says. And that's fine, whatever. I wanted it just because I didn't want to have like... I was going back and forth between that and the Vive, what I wanted. I stuck with the S just because it has that inside-out tracking, so I don't need to set up all the base stations for that. It's just headset and two controllers, and then that's it. That's all you really need to get going. I like how they have it where you can kind of define your room area a little bit, plus they have the pass-through camera on there. So you can see if your kids come up and start asking you questions, you can flip it over and actually see them through the camera, which is kind of cool. So I'm looking forward to that. I know that people have been harping on it because they dropped down the frame rate from 90 hertz to 80 hertz. From what I hear from early reviews, it could be seen two ways. One, it's not a big deal, or two, oh my god, it's a terrible big deal. You should get the $1,000 headset that has 120 hertz. You know what, I'm not spending $1,000 on a goddamn VR headset. I'll spend the same amount of money that I was going to spend on an actual Oculus Rift and get the better Oculus Rift. And I'm just fine with that because I don't know if this laptop can push the 120 hertz in the higher resolution without melting itself. So I'll be fine with just that. Besides, I'm not going to exactly use it for anything super important other than playing Moshpit Simulator and really dumb VR shit. So that's all I'm looking forward to. Bring it to the show because I want to check that out. Definitely. I mean, I'm fortunate enough where I'm sure Bobby will bring the latest and greatest VR to Dragon Con, but I still want to see it when he gets it. Yeah, I mean, and I would be down if I had like a dedicated space to do gaming, I would be down with something more elaborate where I actually have to set up those base stations and stuff, but I don't have that kind of space. So I'm fine with, you know, something where I can go out into the living room, draw my little box that I'm going to play in and just play without having to, you know, set up a bunch of stuff and mount stuff to the wall and that kind of crap. So I'm looking forward to that coming in at some point. And yeah, I don't know. All right, cool. So that's it. All right, the mic gaming week. I'll start with VR. I'll piggyback off you guys. So VR, I've been playing a lot of Beat Saber still on PlayStation 4. PlayStation is the only VR I have right now, but it suits my needs for what I want to play. So Beat Saber is great. I find that it's just really good exercise. So like on days where I haven't really been able to get to the gym just because, like, especially Sundays are bad because we went to brunch earlier and I have to prep for OLR. And the gym is like 20 minutes away. So it's like I, you know, I kind of have to, you know, stay here. So Beat Saber is great for just kind of like getting moving and burning some calories and all that. And I just love that game. Do they have like a calorie tracker type thing in there? I have my watch. My watch does all that stuff. So yeah. So I can just feel it. You know, you can just kind of feel it, how worn out you are after playing because I play a lot of stuff on that hard. I've been kind of toning back on expert a little bit just because I keep failing on expert. So I'm like, all right, let me go through and like do everything on hard, you know, and get some trophies that way, which I've been getting more trophies on PS4 and stuff. And then I'll go back and do the expert because, you know, again, PlayStation 4 is not modded. So I only have like the official sanctioned songs, but with that official pack, there's that additional monster cat. Sorry, I forget the name of the label, but they have that, that DLC pack that was like 10 more songs. So they're monster cat. Yeah, there is that. And I think there's a second pack of those that's supposed to be coming at some point. So yeah, I have enough to play in that game and I've been having a good time and then piggybacking on something that Jamie talked about. I also have been playing a little bit of Ingress and Pokemon Go for the two of you out there to play Ingress. I'm trying to get back to level 12 post recursion before the anomaly in Chicago because I got that event in three weeks. I did play a little bit of Ingress too, but it was because my son does the programming class at this place, Code Ninjas. And they're like, so do you know how we would submit to become a Poke stop? I'm like, well, you got to do it through Ingress. So I submitted their location as an Ingress portal. So I was like, why not? You know, I mean, I've seen the, you know, the rabbit over at the gymnastics place to be a Poke stop. So I'm like, or, you know, Ingress portal poke sound like, well, if that can be one, then I don't see why this couldn't be one. It's a place of education. Yeah. So, yeah, no, it would meet the criteria. You just have to hope it's, you know, not in a area where the other players are going to be like, I don't want that team to have a part of them because I shouldn't really just do what I do. And if it doesn't make it through the first time, just keep submitting it. It'll go through eventually. It's ridiculous, but it works. Let's see. Anyway, what else? I've been playing Pokemon Go as well. I haven't done the new raid yet, though, which I think is coming up later in the show. So I probably shouldn't spoil it too much, but I have not done the new raid yet. I need to do that. And then as far as like other stuff, been playing some Final Fantasy 14 and continuing to try to get the max level gear. I even did a stream this week on my personal stream, which I haven't done in a long time. So I did that. And still playing a little Borderlands here and there. So I'm keeping myself pretty busy, but haven't really explored a lot of new games for me right now. Just kind of relying on my old favorites for the moment. All right. Well, we're going to move on. Speaking of not being here and events and things like that, I just want to remind you guys we will not be here in three weeks. That's Memorial Day weekend. We're going to have a show live, but I hope you guys will have a fun weekend. I'm not sure if Bobby's here that weekend or not. I'll have to see you in chat. But I am going to be off in Chicago. I'm doing an Ingress thing there. And I have a lot of friends in Chicago, so it's kind of like, you know, the Ingress thing is a convenient excuse to do while I'm there. You said Memorial Day weekend? Yes, Memorial Day weekend. Okay. And then Dark Sakura is at DragCon, which... And God, it's going to be busy because not only am I going to DragCon, I'm going to San Diego the day after. To see a couple. If I had time for it, I'd go even further south and see Agdeft, but I don't have a passport either. Oh, yeah, you kind of need one of those. But I'm going to San Diego for one day and then Tuesday I'm going to Disneyland. I'm probably not going to do the Harry Potter thing unless I hate myself and want to drive back on Friday and go to work Saturday. Yeah, I would be full of self-hatred. That'd be a lot. I'm planning, as it is, I'm driving back up by myself. That sounds like it's going to be an action-packed trip, so that'll be fun. It is. It'll be a lot of fun, but I'm going to be way exhausted. I was super exhausted after Easter. Yeah. But I will see so many sisters and drag queens, and if you are in that area and want to have lunch or something, we'll go to Roscoe's. Hit me up on Twitter. Yeah. I suppose the same could be said for Chicago, but I don't know if I'll do any arcade-y things while I'm there. Spring me back chocolate. Yeah, I might get out to replay or something again. I can get those bars now, by the way, but those bonbons, holy shit. Right. Let's get into some gaming news and talk about what's been going on. In the world of gaming this week, there's still a lot of news to cover. Loki, why don't you start us off? Yeah, so this is kind of cool. There was this game, A Dark Room, that basically is this text-based role-playing game, and the guy that made it, Amir Rajan, he put that, well, the game was released a couple weeks ago, put that if you connect a USB keyboard to it and hit the title key, it'll actually open up a code editor. You mean the tilde? Tilde, yeah. It's a title, like it's a music streaming service. Sorry, yeah, tilde. Yes. It'll actually open up a Ruby programming language interpreter and code editor that he put in the hit in the game, which the whole point was, he basically put it that he liked coding and he wanted to create games. Back in the 90s, it was difficult to do that, but now, being that it's more modern, it's easier for people to get into that, and he wanted kids to kind of get into that as well and tinker around. Of course, Nintendo did not agree with that, and they decided to pull the game off the shop because, you know, code editor, running your own code, oh my god, hacks! So that's unfortunate for him that you're not going to be able to do that. I don't think they released a physical version of this, but... I don't think they did, and the bummer is, this is such a huge infraction. It's probably going to make him persona non grata with Nintendo. I don't know if he's going to be able to get his game back or any other game. That's a pretty big deal, but help me understand, the coding that you could do, could you really mess with your Switch with it? I don't think so. I think it's just kind of like a basic editor type thing, but I don't know. Someone's going to find a way around it. Mario Maker is kind of coding. My thing is, you can make games in other games. I guess my brain goes to a little big planet, but I guess there's nothing on the Switch that allows you to freely type things. Maybe they're worried that the door is left open too much on that. Yeah, he said basically, the code editors, all it can do is draw lines, squares, labels, play sounds from the game, and detect button presses. It says you can't even render an image with the damn thing. Yes, if your app is composed completely of labels, squares, and lines, it lets you build an app without having to perform any hacks. Are you able to draw a penis out of dashes and lines? Yes. Well, that's Nintendo's problem. We cannot have ASCII penis on our system. That is foreboding. There it is. Heaven forbid some of those stages in Super Smash, let me tell you. But heaven forbid somebody be allowed to program their own wiener. But yeah, basically the problem is that he cheated their approval process, and so that's why they didn't like that. That's unfortunate. Yeah, I mean, you have to disclose everything that's in there. And that's really the biggest infraction because, for example, this has actually happened to Elder Scrolls Oblivion. They submitted their game for a rating, and you have to disclose everything that's in the game, and they got their rating. But then come to find out, the PC version could be hacked so that you could find OMG, a bear titty on the actual CD. The actual texture was a bear titty, and because they didn't disclose that, when they went for their rating, the game got an adults-only rating. Was it titty, or was it the Southern Hemisphere? Was that the problem? Which game? Elder Scrolls Oblivion. Remember how it got re-rated, AO, because of textures that were found on the original CD? Okay, fuck it. Grand Theft Auto, Hot Coffee mod. There's another great example. Hot Coffee was not accessible without some type of game genie-esque sort of code or altercation. But because Hot Coffee existed on that disc, it got Grand Theft Auto that AO rating. Y'all know that one. That was a big deal. Well, if you're wanting the mess of that Ruby interpreter, he does have it available to mess around with for free. So go to dragonruby.itch.io and you can check it out. Interesting that in spite of all that, he's still kind of like putting it out there for free. That seems bold, we'll say. That seems like what Weird Al did with your Pitiful song. I'm sorry, the toolkit's actually 40 bucks, but you can actually purchase it if you want to. That was the Gaga thing too, wasn't it? No, he didn't do that. One of Gaga's representatives said that she wanted to hear the whole song first. And then she's like, no, I'm fine with it, you can do it. It was the recording company for James Blunt. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Whatever happened to him, by the way. Yeah, right? Still can't sing. So, anyway. Oh, Bobby's got a whole article on the Wikipedias about this. Here's the Oblivion thing. So Bobby copied Pasta in chat. What Bethesda had originally disclosed to us is an example. In that section of the game, there's a hanging corpse. What they disclosed to us was a hanging corpse in the dark, pretty far away and without much detail. And yet when you bring a torch up to the hanging corpse in the actual game, you can see that it's very mutilated with lots of blood and bones. That was a very different depiction, far more intense, far more extreme than what had been disclosed to us. So, I mean, the disclosure is important. So whether Nintendo is afraid of ASCII dicks in this editor or not, whatever that issue is, the problem really is that this is a pretty full-fledged feature that he put in this game and intentionally made it difficult to access that people wouldn't find it. And then was like, you know, it was a problem. He didn't disclose it. And if he had disclosed it, maybe Nintendo could have reviewed it and seen it's not that big a deal. You can't run homebrew on it and maybe would have let it stay. Who knows? So, I kind of doubt they would have let it stay. But we like to think that way, right? We like to think Nintendo is going to be a little more proactive like that. Who knows? Anyway, let's move on. And let's talk about Platinum Games. Y'all like Platinum Games, right? Platinum Games is set to start self-publishing. Platinum is going to be self-publishing their games such as... Well, we don't know exactly what games yet, but we know some examples of games that were kind of one and done were things like The Wonderful 101 and Vanquish. And because Platinum doesn't really publish these themselves, they can't really control if a sequel is going to happen or not. And I'm sure most people, when they think of Platinum and sequels and that whole thing, they think about Bayonetta. And so there was an interview recently with Video Games Chronicle where Atsushi Inaba, who's the head of Platinum, said that they want to self-publish their games. Because quote, what it means is we have a lot of different choices in the way that we want to make games. It's that simple. And quite frankly, in the case of Bayonetta, it took a lot of time and energy to get it to the point where sequels could be made. It wasn't as simple as picking up the phone and asking, hey, can we do this? There were lots of pieces that needed to fall into place and a lot of negotiating that had to occur. It's absolutely the truth that there are cases where you want to do a sequel, but if you don't own the IP, you can't do it. Platinum also has two unannounced games in development, so we don't know if there's any possible sequels are there. Well, I guess not because the IP, they can't bring back something wonderful 101. So there are going to be new IPs most likely and things that are owned by the studio. Marvelous 102. They're saying we're in the middle of designing, the continued quote here from the studio head, we're in the middle of designing something that has never been done before. I know a lot of people say that, but the game we're working on is truly unlike anything else. This is something that has never been designed before. So from a game design perspective, we're very excited right now. Big words about the whole never seen this before. It'll be interesting to see if it's really true. I would also like to know if they were able to do something with Scalebound. Did they maybe change things around in the game so it doesn't look like the project that Microsoft funded and maybe that's something they're going to put out after all? Who knows? Who knows? You see, this game that we've never attempted before, it's like Bayonetta. But instead of putting guns on our hands and on our feet, this dude is going to have a gun out of his ass. Why not? Why not? Let's do it. We're going to call it Wrecked Gun. Oh my god, I'm so glad you're not a game designer. Oh darn. Bayonetta 3 is still a thing. Hey, remember? Bayonetta 3 got announced a couple years ago. And that was the last we heard. Yes! Yeah, remember? Hello? Remember? Bayonetta 3 is the thing that's happening. And that's all we know. It was a very quick announcement trailer. I'm hoping... Well, you can't announce things like four years, like several years ago and then just like all of a sudden... Yeah, you can. I guess you can. Everybody does it, I guess. E3 is what? Like the week? Here's the thing. So we're gone Memorial Day weekend. I think that week we get back is the night that Bethesda interrupts our show with their press conference because E3 is like underway. So, I mean, E3 is just around the corner. So I'm super curious if Bayonetta 3... I should just stay in LA. ...isn't going to show up. I know, right? You should just go to E3. No, I can't. I know. I'm sorry, but I would rather be at work than go to E3. E3 is work in some ways, depending on who you're representing. No, I'm going to be around so many people for a convention I'm actually interested in, so... I'll let... There's a little salt around here when it comes to E3. No, let them jerk each other off. I don't care. Let them show their game dicks and let everyone else compare them. I'll just wait for it to come out from the comfort of my own home. They don't give out good swag anymore. Let them put that on the poster for E3. Let them jerk each other off. That's not on the approved Microsoft list, unfortunately. As long as they've got some good dick jiggle physics. I mean, that's really all people want. Listing! Get sexual threat. Can you save that for later in the show? Excuse me. Oh, no, we gotta... Are you all paying attention? We have a list. Everything is very... It's up on the screen, even though I haven't been totally right with it. It's a list, and I don't see... Do you see the Microsoft thing up there yet? That's me flipping off the list. Sorry, Lucky. You better get to the next item on the list. I'm very delicate. The next item on the list is yours. Yeah, whatever. Rocket League! Who likes Rocket League in this room? I think it's cool. I wish I had more time to play more of it. Well, their developer, Psyonix, is, quote, joining the Epic Games family. So Epic Games ruined something else. Not yet. Not yet. They're planning to ruin it. Well, the ruination is happening. It's going to be closing in late May or early June. They've released an FAQ about this. But they wanted to... I guess they're just acquiring it because Rocket League is good. I mean, maybe? I don't know. They just like ruining things for people. Yeah, Rocket League's pretty good. It's an interesting title because Rocket League has esports, conventions. You don't want to just poo-poo right off this game. Rocket League has a huge following behind it. I want to say, I hope I'm not misappropriating, but I want to say our voiceover guy, Jason, really is into Rocket League and goes to some of these events and things like that. So there's definitely a culture out there that loves this game. Well, at any rate, they want to assure people that nothing will change about the day-to-day enjoyment of their game. I think it's kind of interesting that that wording is used. So basically, in the short term, they say nothing about the game will change. But they're still going to go with its update roadmap and to keep it going for, quote, as long as you'll have us. Psyonix said that they will bring the game to the Epic Games Store and that this is, of course, because the acquisition will allow them to grow the game so they couldn't do it on their own. So I don't know. They said nothing's changing, but we'll see. Here's why I think Rocket League does well and why I actually enjoy Rocket League a lot too. Here's why Rocket League, and it's honestly a great land for Epic, whether you are a fan of Epic or not, it makes sense why they want to have this game because, as is mentioned in chat over there, SSG100Matt says Rocket League is serious esports, and for sure. Here's the thing about Rocket League. It's a stupidly simple game to explain. See this car? Use car to push ball in goal. Car soccer. Two words. Yeah, car soccer. Go. And that's Rocket League, right? Where is Dota 2? Let's explain Dota 2. You ready? So you have these lanes, and every lane has some walls and towers, and you're trying to catch the thing at the end of the lane, and you have these 50 different heroes, and let me explain to you how they're all different, and you have this little thing that you can send back to the store. I'm sorry, that sounds really boring. Here's the thing, and I'm not knocking Dota. I think Dota is super fun in its own way as well, but I think it also goes to, like, I have a lot of friends that say they really enjoy board games, and when I respond, I love Clue, they get pissed off. But here's the thing. Clue is very much a board game, and Clue is a board game you can explain in five minutes. Maybe ten. Clue is a little more complicated than something like Candyland. And everybody has their own house rules for Clue. Like, for example, do you bring the piece to the conservatory when you make an accusation, or does it get to stay on the square where it's at? Every house plays it differently. Movie rules. You explained it all in the foyer. So, but then, so there's that, but then there's also Axis and Allies. Like, that's the type of board game that if I don't know how to play that, I'm not a fucking fan. So anyway, my point is, I think part of the reason why Rocket League is so loved and so well in esports is that it's a relatively simple concept when all is said and done. It's a Clue. It's a monopoly. It's a very easy concept, and that doesn't make it bad. Those are, Scrabble is a game in every household, almost. Okay? It's, you know, just a very easy type of game. Bonds006 in chat says, OMG, why I did not get into Dota. I think going off my explanation there. Kaijuto says, The main reason why people love Rocket League is because when you learn to fly and make aerials, you feel badass. It's a feel-good game. Bobby Blackwolf says, Rocket League is closer to traditional sports than something like Overwatch. That's a good, you know, I know that might sound, but I get it. Like, because, yeah, it's kinda soccer. Kinda. Sorta. And then they put new modes in the game that are like, kinda basketball. Yeah, as 200Matt said, I had friends play a full map game of Axis and Allies, so I don't know why I pick on Axis and Allies. It's a fine game. But yeah, one of my friends in high school tried to teach me how to play that game, and I was just like, And by the way, did you know, like, when I was playing Magic the Gathering, like, for the first year I played Magic the Gathering, my friends and I were playing it completely wrong. Completely wrong. Like, we didn't understand the mechanics. And when the computer game came out that kinda forced you to play by the officials, I'm talking the original computer game that came with the giant fucking Magic the Gathering card and all that stuff, like, it's, yeah, it was very enlightening. I had, like, one of the ginormous Lords of the Pit. And we used to use the, what was it, the candelabra that let you, like, shuffle any one card into your deck. We would use that particular card to bring out the giant Lord of the Pit that we could put all of his little pitties on it. And then, of course, every so often we would randomly, like, mix in a card from another game, like, we'd have Captain Picard. And our house rule is that if Captain Picard came out, everyone loses. Everyone else loses. It's an insta-win. Card games. Another good example. Card games. Very easy. Cards Against Humanity. You teach somebody how to play that game in two seconds, right? Card game like, um... Taboo is another easy one. Taboo is pretty, I'm trying to think of a complicated card game. I've only ever played it drunk. What about, like, playing something like, um... A deck-building game. Gin. Dominion. Oh, Cribbage. Cribbage. Yeah, that's, I mean, it's not, I mean, Cribbage isn't, like, hard, but it definitely takes, like, gets some explanation. There's an explanation to it, for sure. P-Nuckle. Another good example. They're not hard games. They just take a while to explain. Yeah. Anyway. Let's move on. We can talk about card games all night, but I wanna talk, speaking of esports, there's a Scandalos going on, right? Yeah, it's, it's not, I mean, it's, it's not good, but it's not as bad as we might allude to, but... So, basically, during this, uh, the, I guess, uh, World Cup qualifiers for Fortnite, there was one of the, um, pro players, uh, DamienXXIFCook. He was, uh, accused of colluding with other players to help him rank up. So, basically, there's, um, video out there of him landing next to a couple, uh, other players, and, basically, the other players allowing him to kill them to kinda help rank up. And, of course, that went viral, and, um, you know, that's not a good, good face. But, on top of that, though, apparently, uh, there's been other cheaters as well. So, along with that, um, Epic Games actually went and did some investigating to see kinda what was going on, and there's been bans. So, 14-day competitive bans on several different players, um, including, I think, they didn't name XXIF, but I believe that they were included as well, and they have been stripped of their qualifying spots. Because of, um, boosting other players. The boosting thing's been a problem in Overwatch. Yeah, so. Boy. You know, it's kinda hard when you have these online games that you're trying to do qualifiers in without, like, any really big oversight. It's also an interesting thing that doesn't really I'm trying to think, is there an equivalent in, like, football, basketball, as we know it, like, you know, traditional sports, if you will, is there an equivalent of boosting? I don't think there really is. No, it would be like throwing a game, but, like, Yeah, I guess throwing a game is very bad, but, like, you know, if you go and mentor a camp or something, you're not exactly breaking the rules, you know, or, I guess, can you wear a disguise and go play a minor league game? I guess that would be, like, the closest thing I can think of. Like, you're wearing a fake mustache and playing in a minor league game. Yeah, that's, that's, that's a little different. This is more of, like, I think, yeah, just, just, like, oh, hey, you know, we really want those kings to make it to the playoffs, so let's just all kind of drop the ball and let them throw in those three-pointers, that type of thing. Oh, kings are never gonna make the playoffs. Exactly. That's the only way they would ever win. But no one's ever gonna do that because they all wanna win, and, yeah. Alright, well, let's talk about something, uh, highly interactive. That's right here, Twitch, Twitch TV, where, uh, you can interact with our show when we're live. Of course, we love our podcast folks as well, and they, you always can interact with us, uh, delayed a little bit over on Twitter, twitter.com slash o-l-r, and you can also do that, uh, maybe through Facebook or through our email bag. Participate at orangelandtrader.com. But, uh, when you're broadcasting on Twitch, you can interact in real time, and more and more games are starting to think about how can we kind of incorporate that into our game, and Borderlands 3. Which looks amazing, by the way. Yeah, they had a big reveal this week, right? They had the gameplay reveal, and I'm totally in day one. That looks all sorts of awesome. I have to admit, I did not watch the gameplay reveal yet, because I'm still making my way through the other ga- I mean, I know a gameplay reveal's not gonna give anything away, but I just, you know, I'm just focused on trying to get through the original games, uh, before this comes out. But, uh, yeah, I'm excited for folks that are into this series, and now I see why people enjoy Borderlands. I get it. Um, anyhow, uh, so during the, uh, Borderlands 3 reveal, they talked about an extension called the EchoCast. So if you use this extension, apparently, um, you can- the viewers can look at the streamer's loadouts, look at what's in the backpacks. So through the extension, I guess you could probably click on something on the view window, and even if I'm not looking at my inventory at this minute, you can look at my inventory on your- your Twitch screen, because that's how the extensions kind of work, right? I don't know if we use any extensions on, um, VOG Network's channel. I don't- Bobby would have to refresh my memory. I don't think so, because we're not really playing games here. Um, but a lot of the more traditional Twitch extensions, there's things like, um, you know, you can interact with the streamer, maybe play noises, or, you know, sometimes you can affect what's going on in the game. My favorites are, like, I was watching the other- Mixer does this a lot, too. I watched the other day, there's a guy that, um, he has, like, a currency that they can earn by playing different games in chat, and then they spend that currency on putting cheats in Grand Theft Auto, so they can put cheats in to hurt or, you know, help the player, and it's all sorts of craziness. Yeah, this, uh, Tomb Raider reboot had something like that in, like, the multiplayer or something, where, like, that your Twitch chat could affect what's going on. So, I mean, we've heard about games, you know, kind of interacting with Twitch, but anyway, uh, also there will be special loot chests throughout the game. If a streamer opens them, you can opt into a challenge called the Rare Chest Event. This means the viewer would get a copy of whatever the streamer gets. It's kind of, I like that, that's kind of interesting. It would be a shift code, I guess, that would be given out, and scaled to the viewer's level when you redeem it in your own game. So, interesting. Um, the gameplay reveal, I guess the EchoCast extension was, uh, coincided with that, so if you were watching the Borderlands 3 reveal, you kind of get an idea how that works, which I missed out on, but, uh, did they, did they actually have that going during the gameplay? I didn't watch it on Twitch, so I don't know. So, interesting, though. I think that's really cool. Um, I like how more games are thinking about how can we, like, really embrace this streaming thing, and, like, do our own stuff with it. I think that's really cool. So, uh, yeah. S2100Matt says, uh, this opens the door for people to judge other people's inventory. I tend to be a massive hoarder in games like this. I would imagine that you could turn it off, I suppose, if you wanted to. Maybe. I don't know. Anyway, let's move on. DarkSakura, what do you have for us? Well, there is a video game hall of fame. Of course, we know about this one, among other ones, but we're talking about the nice, legit one. You know what I mean by legit, right? Uh, meaning non-pirated, I guess. Well, no, meaning that it's actually a pretty big one. So, uh, this year, the, um, the, uh, it's the Strong's World Video Game Hall of Fame. So, uh, the, uh, games that are being included are, duh duh duh, uh, Mortal Kombat, which, it's got a deserving place. Um, Super Mario Kart, uh, also, um, Colossal Cave Adventure, and get this, Windows Solitaire. Then again, I get that. How much of us wasted so much time on that? Seriously? Windows Solitaire was a game for filthy casuals. Um, filthy casuals, really? Even, you know what I mean. Yeah. It's a joke. But, and all joking aside, um, Solitaire, and I feel like this just came up on the show a few weeks ago, Solitaire's a great game for developing motor skills. Like, if you are, you know, maybe older and haven't used computers an awful lot, Solitaire is a great way to learn. I reckon. It's just, it's never... I've used that in my professional life. That's all why I kind of bring that up. Somebody who's a little less comfortable with computers, I'll say, have you played Solitaire at home? You should think about it. Okay. Well, it does get you kind of into the point and click mentality. Yes. You know, which I guess for people doing, like, data entry or something, that might be worthwhile. But I just think it's very interesting that it's finally being recognized. That instead of just being, you know, bloating software for Microsoft Windows, it's a mainstay. On top of that, with this picture, it's got, like, the same monitor that Dan and I had when I first moved in with him. This little dinky computer monitor. That's pretty funny. Um, you know, but the other thing about Colossal Adventure is that, you know, Colossal Cave Adventure, sorry, is that it was also a cassette game. So, you know, but the other games that were, uh... Sorry, the Colossal Cave Adventure, that's a text adventure game, right? Yeah. That predates Zork. So it's kind of like your text adventure representation, right? Yeah, it's like your intro to all things text. Can you read? You can play it. I think that was one of the first, yeah. And I think that's why it's noteworthy. But the other thing is that there were some other games that were in the list of finalists, but did not make it, including, those were Candy Crush Saga, Centipede, DDR, Half-Life, Myst, NBA 2K, Sid Meier Civilization, and Super Smash Brothers Melee. Here's the thing. Shouldn't a game have to be out for at least 10 years before we start thinking about the Video Game Hall of Fame? Like, when it comes to Candy Crush. Because I would say a game like Mortal Combat, I think if we had evaluated whether it belonged in a Video Game Hall of Fame in 1995, or whatever year that game came out, or even one or two years after it was out, I'm not so sure we would think that that game is going to end up in the Hall of Fame someday. Because of how controversial it was. What are my rules for classic game? Yes. But you're not curating this museum, unfortunately. I'll curate a museum. And it's basically going to be Mass Effect and Sega games. Which, if you go to the classic game of the week list, is similar to what she did. No, I have Compile because of Guardian Legend. Okay, sorry. One exception. Bitch, don't doubt me. Hearts. But anyhow, that's cool. And I see in our chat, SD100Matt says, I keep meaning to go to this place. My girlfriend has family in Rochester and we're up there often. Hey, if you go, take video. Take a ton of it. Bring us a souvenir. I'd be curious. Anyway. And then ship me some Waffle House Grits. Metal Mayhem in chat says, didn't cassette games have horrendous accessing and low times? Oh, absolutely. Absolutely, they did. Well, on top of that, I'm sure I've spoken ad nauseam about the problems with the Coleco Atom. That anytime you had a power surge, it would erase your cassettes. Right. But the thing about it, I mean, the cassette was what existed before the disc, which existed before the CD, which is ironic. The audio is also used, kind of, two of those forms. To be fair, there were 11 inch floppies and 13 inch floppies around the same time that cassette became a viable storage media. And I think cassette was just you know, like, again, there was no way to, like, have a pre-installed game that you could put on your system or what have you without, like, typing it in if it weren't for cassette or disc. Yeah. You either programmed that shit in BASIC or you, I mean, well, in computers for production at the time, we're still, some of them were actually still using Fortran and punch cards. So, there you go. Yeah. So, it is kind of interesting, though, how tapes kind of went to CD later on, but anyway. So, okay, there you go. Additions to the Video Game Hall of Fame. It's a decent selection. I mean, when you hear some of the games, they omit it. Of course, my fanboy is going, what? No Civilization? They couldn't, Mortal Combat couldn't wait another year for Civilization? I knew that would make you sad. I know, a little bit, but I can't, like, look at any of those games they picked and say it doesn't deserve it. Yeah, they all deserve their place in there. They all deserve it in their own way. Like, even if you kind of look at Solitaire and go, huh? Like, again, you have to look at, what did it do for gaming the big picture as opposed to just gaming for the hardcore audience? Seriously, that is exactly it. I mean, although, I must say, the thing that disappoints me is that DDR isn't included. Sure. Because DDR, for itself, was actually fairly revolutionary for genres. Well, it created a genre, practically. Well, Beatmania really did. DDR is why we're here. If it were me, I would put Beatmania in before DDR, because we wouldn't have DDR without Beatmania. Or Spiderstomp. Here's the thing, though. Here's what's ultimately going to happen, because this is based in America, and it's a Murica thing. I think DDR was more known here than Beatmania. Which, to be fair, is Konami's own damn fault, because they released it here as Hip-Hop Mania, and it wasn't really the same kind of thing. And they did that, I think, after DDR. Yeah, and they never tried the five key releases here and that stuff until way later. So, I mean, DDR is what people know here. My first exposure was BM98. Sure, but you also go to anime conventions, which is not, you know... Well, at the time, I did. At the time. Alright, well, let's move on, and let's get to our next story, which is from Loki. Alright, so this has got me very excited, even though we know no details about this yet, and there's a good chance that they're going to fuck it up. But you're still going to pre-order your ticket. Oh, yeah, seriously. So Saints Row the Movie is something that's going to be worked on, and apparently right now, they've got a director attached, director F. Gary Gray, who is, I guess, working on, or he had worked on The Fate of the Furious and the upcoming Men in Black International. And then, of course, Greg Russo is going to be writing the treatment as well, and he's rebooting the Mortal Kombat franchise in the movie forms. And, yeah, so that's about all we know about it right now. I'm assuming this is something that's going to be coming way later on. They've got to have Daniel Dae Kim as Gat, because that's really the only way I'd want to see that. And what the hell? Let's just put Troy Baker in there as well as the boss, because that'd be awesome. What do you want to see in a Saints Row movie? I want to see fucking crazy shit, but being that it's The Fate of the Furious, that movie is pretty over the top as it was. So let's just, like, take that. Let's take the new Fast and the Furious spin-off movie that they have coming out pretty soon. Take all of that stuff and just say, tell the director, do whatever the fuck you want. Just go as crazy as you want and make it... It doesn't even have to be believable. Just go fucking nuts, and then that would be perfect. Tigerclaw in chat asks, will the Saints Row movie have the self-awareness and meta-humor? If it doesn't, I hope they don't make it. It needs to, like, seriously. I don't think they should directly adapt one of the games, but Saints Row 3, again, I cannot stress this enough. I was laughing so hard during the opening moments of Saints Row 3. Like, I was crying. Like, it's just, like, the game is so fucking funny. And my character, you know, I had, like, a female character that was, like, falling through planes and stuff like that. Like, the opening is just ridiculous. And I'm just like, this game is so, so stupid. I love it. I love it. Yes, I want that. I want that, too. So stupid that it's amazing. Make that bad Sonic movie that Loki wants to see. But Saints Row, put Jim Carrey in the Saints Row movie. Is there a part for him in there? Not really, but, um, but yeah, just, like, over the top. Like, there's plenty of movies that are kind of over the top. I mean, many in the Fast and the Furious franchise. I mean, they're just, like, the whole Fast and the Furious thing, which is over the top. But that, that's why it was good, you know? I just don't want them to do, like, a cheap just, like, this is gonna be kind of, like, Fast and the Furious. But, I don't know, like, Gat is such a great character, it's gonna be hard to find some, if they recast him, it's gonna be hard to, like, get that character right. The boss can be who, that's gonna be the hard part, is the boss, because who's it gonna be? Because it can be pretty much anybody. Um, I don't know. Metal Mayhem in Chats is a Saints Row movie needs to have a gun, dubstep gun and a giant purple dildo bat. Honestly, cosigned. Like, that might surprise you that I'm saying that, but those are the things- And Professor Genki. Those are the things that make Saints Row, like, fucking stupid. But, like, in that really funny way. You know what I mean? And this is perfect for, like, that really stupid action movie genre, where it's like, you'll make it, it'll be fucking stupid, and it'll make tons of money, and they'll make more and more, and it'll be, whatever. Uh, Bonds 006 says, Saints Row film, a very bad over-the-top Deadpool sans Ryan Reynolds. Deadpool? Honestly, maybe Deadpool is a good thing to kinda look at for how to do this. Oh my god. Yeah. I'm cosigning Ryan Reynolds as the boss for the Saints Row movie. Hell yes. I don't, the man can only do so much, but I, that would be amazing if he did. Wasn't Ryan Reynolds supposed to be doing, like, the Clue movie at some point? I don't know. He can do everything. He signed on to all those board game movies or something? Whatever happened to that? Development hell, I guess. But yes, Daniel Dae Kim and Ryan Reynolds. They're saying Keith David is the narrator. Well, Keith, Keith David's supposed, yeah. He's just supposed to be Julius, so. Uh, SD100Matt says that Hobbs and Shaw movie looks ridiculous, I'm concerned. Exactly. Keep that level of ridiculousness and over-the-top, you know. It just, just keep it going. Yeah. Alright. Uh, anyhow, let's move on. Uh, got another story here before we get to our classic game of the week, and this is about a classic game of sorts. Earthworm Jim has a new game in development for the new Intellivision Amico, which, of course, as we know, is coming out in the year 2020. I still don't like those controllers. I get it. Like, I don't like them. Yeah. I hope they have traditional controllers as well. Yeah. I'm sorry to call this out on air, but make sure when you do this, uh, it's away from the mic, because remember the new mics are super sensitive, so it's picking up the bags. Sorry. And I was sitting on the mic. Anyway, um, so, uh, the new Intellivision, of course, is coming out, uh, what, 10.10.2020, and, uh, Earthworm Jim hasn't had a game since, what, 95? So they're making a new one. Oh, no, there was a high, uh, there was an HD remake. They did do that. Yeah. Yeah, but not as a proper sequel. So, uh, the original team members are participating in this, uh, including Doug to Naples, which, um, he's a character. We'll put it that way. My understanding is that, uh, he is doing it on a volunteer basis, so if you're worried about possibly money and all that stuff, it sounds like that is, it's gonna be a little easier to separate the art from the artist in this, this particular circumstance because he's volunteering, which is kind of interesting, um, but cool, I guess. And, of course, Tommy Tallarico, he did the music and the soundtrack before, uh, so, uh, he's gonna be doing that again, of course. And what a coinkydink that Tommy Tallarico is playing such a role as the CEO of Intellivision, so it kind of makes sense why this game is the one that they're bringing back. Um, I was interested, though, when I saw a lot of the comments on this about how, well, looks like I'm not playing Earthworm Jim because they're putting it on this trash console and, well, I'm just, uh, fuck exclusivity agreements, I'm not gonna play it. Well, they don't know what... And I'm just kind of like, oh, shut up. Like, do y'all know what business is? Because if, if the Amico wasn't trying to get some exclusives and some games that are, like, kind of like must-haves or must-tries, then you all would shit on the Amico for not having any games worth playing. So, like, this kind of goes back to the beginning. I just don't know about the controllers, though. Like, I know, I don't remember, you know, the ColecoVision too fondly, and I know the Intellivision stuff's kind of similar. Um, I don't know. I just, I have a hard time imagining how that's gonna work, but I'm sure it'll make it work. Bobby is pointing out you saw a render, but not the actual controller, so. Right. There's still time for things to change based on fan feedback. Perhaps. Uh, Metal Mayhem says, so long as the new Earthworm Jim is like the first two games, not Earthworm Jim 3D, I'll be happy. I think it's a safe bet to say it's gonna be like the first two games that you remember. Yeah, I think that's what they're going for in this console. It's supposed to be all 2D stuff, isn't it? Uh, yeah, I think so. Uh, Dartusuya says, I know Tommy made a comment going to bat for him, whatever it's worth, but I do hope he does a good soundtrack for this game. Um, and it's also interesting to point out, you know, for, whether you hate the exclusiveness or not, remember Intellivision has very firmly said games will cost at most, what, ten bucks? I think it was actually under that, it was like eight bucks. So that means, I would assume Earthworm Jim is going to be no different. It's going to be like an eight dollar game. So, interesting. I, I just. Yeah, I'd be curious to see what happens when it comes out. You know, it's, it's interesting to see how the Intellivision is coming into its own. And I'll be very curious to see more moves like this about what, what kind of games are they really going to bring to the table as we approach 2020 and the release. You know, we still have over a year to go, a year and a half to go before we get to October of 2020. So I'll be very curious to see what more develops in the coming months. So. All right. As Joe and I, Matt, points out, the main thing is they're taking their time. And Bobby Blackwolf pointing out they're not targeting people who would use pro controllers, they're targeting mobile users. We'll see. I am, I, I'll give it a chance. Let's, let's a lot of this is still hypothesis and theory. And that's, and that's fine. I like like, and I'm fine with the controllers being the way they are. I just hope that they have the forethought to like, we'll have Bluetooth and you bring your own damn controller if you want, you know, that, that's fine. Um, would be nice. I'm not saying they have to do it the way everybody else is doing it, but I mean, if I have my choice between, you know, using the type of controls I would on a mobile game versus an actual controller, I'm going to choose an actual controller. We will see. There's still a long way to go. Anyway, before we get to the release of Earthworm Jim, we're going to take a trip down memory lane and visit the classic game of the week. Every week here on the show, Dark Soccer steps into the gaming vault and tries to find a game that she thinks, hey, you kids, you should be checking this one out. This is a classic, y'all. We do talk about this one a lot. Yes. So, uh, yeah, we have brought this game up a few times. So, uh, and it's not a Sega game. Nope. It is an absolute Nintendo game. So what is the classic game of the week? Clu Clu Land, which came out in 1984 in Japan and, uh, just under a year later in the U.S. and, uh, so in Japan it came out November 22nd, 1984, and in the U.S. it came out October 18th, 1985, and then, uh, in 87 in, uh, Europe. So Clu Clu Land, first of all, people are like, what does this have to do with, uh, is it Clu from Tron? What? Um, no. It actually is an, uh, Anglicization of, uh, the Japanese title Kuru Kuru, um, you know, uh, it was Kuru Kuru Land, which basically, Kuru Kuru is an onomatopoeia that means around and around. Uh, or you might have also heard Guru Guru, you know, same thing. Um, so basically the main character has to grab poles and swing around, so that's where it comes from. It's the same, uh, uh, kind of title for the Game Boy romance game, uh, Kuru Kuru Kururin. So, anyway, um, in Clu Clu Land you play a balloon fish named Bubbles in the U.S. She was Gloopy in Japan, which I think Gloopy's a funnier name. Um, she swims around in a maze trying to uncover these gold ingots. Um, so you basically, um, are fighting this sea urchin called Unira, who is stealing all of the treasures in the underwater kingdom of Clu Clu Land. So Bubbles has to retrieve all the treasure and spin around and gather all the gold ingots, um, and... The rupees. They look like rupees. Well, that's because they reuse all the things anyway. But at any rate, um, it is, uh, um, you know, she, if she gets attacked by an Unira then she'll lose a life. Um, she can also, though, uh, stun an Unira by using a sound, uh, a sound wave. Um, you can also lose your life if you fall into a black hole or when the time runs out. And of course, you run out of all lives, it's game over. Um, and then sometimes you have to pass over the ingots in an odd number to uncover them. And, cause they will go between their uncovered side and a dull side. You know, it's kind of like how, uh, um, Qbert goes in later levels where you have to do double jumps on some of the items. Um, there was, um, other versions that came out. There was a versus Clu Clu Land. Have you guys ever seen one? Oh god, I think I did once. I do remember, like a multi-versus machine and I think Clu Clu Land was one of them cause I kind of made fun of it. That's how I saw my first versus Clu Clu Land. It was at a Godfather's Pizza in Mobile, Alabama. Um, so, of course, you know, released for the coin-op Nintendo versus system. It had twice as many puzzles in a new enemy called Boss Unira. Um, different level themes and some other features. Um, and a port of this one was released as the final game for the Famicom Disk System as called Clu Clu Land. Welcome to New Clu Clu Land. Um, the NES version and the Famicom Disk System version are both unlockable in Game, uh, in Animal Crossing, the one on GameCube. Um, that was retitled as Clu Clu Land D outside of Japan. Um, other ports in 2001, there was a port to the Sharp Zaris PDA. Um, we had, uh, in 2004, it was released on the Famicom Mini for Game Boy Advance. Um, Bubbles was also a trophy in Super Smash Brothers Melee. And the Clu Clu Land NES music and the Unira enemy are items in Super Smash Brothers Brawl. And, of course, they also re-return as items in Super Smash Brothers Ultimate. Um, she's also, uh, in a secret level of the Game Boy Advance game, DK King of Swing, which was pretty much inspired by Clu Clu Land. Um, there's a microgame of Clu Clu Land in WarioWare Smooth Moves for Wii. And, um, Clu Clu Land's Nintendo microgame in Mario Twisted. Uh, the rupee from the Legend of Zelda series was modeled after the Inkot sprite from Clu Clu Land. That money bag also looked like the money bag that was in Legend of Zelda Link to... or, uh, Adventures of Link. And they also said that the Dig Dogger enemy from, uh, Legend of Zelda series was basically based off of the Unira. Um, of course, Clu Clu Land is also one of the games included in NES remix. And there you have it. All right. Kuru Kuru Land. Your classic game of the week, a game that, uh, some of you in chat are like, I never really understood how this game works. What is this? What is this that's being drawn on stream right now? Glasses. Yep. How about that? Cause, I mean, a lot of them just were like, you know, little puzzles. Once you figured out what the puzzle piece was, then it was really easy to go in and figure out how to swing around them. Yeah. It's kind of like, um, it's kind of like that game, uh, Anticipation. Once you've played it enough, that little pencil draws, like, two lines and you know what the answer is. Ain't no Anticipa- Yeah. It makes that game a whole lot, uh, less fun at that point. I was trying to do a Rocky joke. I know. I know. All right. Uh, thank you for that classic game of the week selection. Um, speaking of classic games, uh, we have a contribution this week for our little, uh, break segment here we do in the middle of the show. And it is from, uh, our pal Bobby Blackwolf, who went to a classic game show in Atlanta last week and found this really cool, uh, TI 99 4A. Y'all remember that computer? I think I had one. I had two. I, I didn't- I did it as a classic system remember? You did. That's right. You did do a classic system. Well get this. So what he's about to show us is Dragon's Lair, the 80s game running on a TI 99 4A. What? And I, I don't mean like some scaled down port cause there was like a Commodore 64 version of Dragon's Lair but it was completely different. How much RAM do they have to put in this thing to make it work? Well, we're about to find out. So why don't we turn it over to Bobby and find out. Hello, Orange Lounge Radio. Bobby Blackwolf here. Uh, I know I'm usually on a couple hours ago but Rob really likes having content in the middle of the show and I'm here at the Vintage Computer Festival Southeast 7.0 in Roswell, Georgia and uh, I saw a game that uh, is not a classic game of the week because it was just released but it's for really old systems and it's a really old game. So I have Alan here. Alan, what am I looking at here? You are looking at Dragon's Lair for the Texas Instruments TI 99 for a home computer. And this is obviously the side-scrolling platformer that was released on the NES, right? Uh, I got something to do. No, absolutely not. This is an actual conversion. This is a fully licensed conversion of Dragon's Lair made by Harmless Lion and he took the high definition video and audio from the PC release in I think it was the early 2000s digitized it with his own software including the video and the audio and then produced the game out of it. He took 80 megabytes of data, crammed it into this little cartridge that gets banked in 8K chunks and it's fully playable. And I have been playing it and it's just as unforgiving as I remember. But you really don't have like a laser displayer hiding under here, right? You're not doing like video trickery? No, no. Those are actually a little bit too expensive for my budget. So, how long do you, like, what's the backstory behind this? Like, how long did it take him to do it? I want to say it took him at least a couple of years to work on it but he's been actually building the fundamentals for a couple of decades. If you've been in the Atariage forums at all in the TI sub forums of Atariage you'll see where he's put up some demos here and there of sampled audio, sampled video. One of his first ones actually was Spaceballs that he did on a, I think it was a 4 megabyte cartridge. And he says that this was his target game. This was one of the games he always wanted to do and he spent all this time getting the process perfected so he could produce it. So is this an unmodified TI-99 or is this running any expansion boards that you're running it on here? No, this is a completely stock unexpanded TI-99 4A console. That means there's no 32K, it does not have the F18A replacement for the video processor. It's completely stock as if you opened the box in 1983. So do you know, is he worried about any takedowns like whoever owns the Dragon's Lair IP? Because we just saw the Super Mario Brothers Commodore 64 conversion and apparently Nintendo sent a cease and desist once it hit the media sites. Has he been contacted by anybody that owns the rights or do we even know who has the Dragon's Lair rights right now? Well the rights to Dragon's Lair is owned by a company called Digital Leisure. I believe they're out of Canada and he actually contacted them, purchased a license and got their blessing on this conversion of Dragon's Lair for the TI. That's awesome. So I know there's a boxed copy here and I know that you're giving it away but where can people find it if they can't get a boxed copy? It's actually no longer available. He produced 155 cartridges and he was able to ship all of his orders before the license expired for production and at this point there will never be another release of it. No ROMs anywhere? There are no ROMs anywhere and that has a lot to do with the licensing and plus it's just one of those things. It just kind of makes it a little bit more valuable that way. So if people want to play it they need to come to like a vintage computer festival somewhere? At this point yes. The only way to play it is if you know somebody who has it. Or if you win it here which I competed and got third to last. Actually I think you're fourth to last. I'm fourth to last now. Today right now I do have a fully boxed copy completely unopened ready for the winner today to take home with him. Right now we have about 20 minutes left in the contest. We do have a top score winner by the name of JR just walking around here having a good time waiting to take home his copy of Dragon's Lair. It was fun to play. I didn't do too well. He claimed the controller. But then he fixed the controller and I can't play again because I've already played. So I can't compete again. It runs on regular Atari style joystick and everything. It is what it says it is. It's really impressive. I remember seeing a demo of this. You had just gotten a demo last year. Yes. Last year at VCF I was able to obtain the demo from Mike Brent, Tursi, Harmless Lion. I was able to show it here and had it playing. It was quite amazing. A lot of people stopped by to take a look at it and we were really championing the bit to get the final release and we finally got it. The technical achievement is absolutely amazing. Now remember I said that this is an unmodified TI-99-4A but obviously an out of the box cartridge Is there some hardware trickery that's going on to actually make this work? There is absolutely some sorcery going on in here. Mike Brent he knows this hardware inside and out. This is an absolute masterpiece. A symphony of hardware and software. It's more than just the program. It took a cartridge that had not been invented. It extends the banking scheme of our cartridge port beyond what has ever been used. The cartridge actually has the ability to hold 128 megabytes of data banked in 8K chunks. He has it loaded with 80 megabytes of data right now for this game. So Mike put a lot of work, he's put a lot of time, blood, sweat and tears to make what is an absolute masterpiece. And I guess here's the question some people would ask is why would someone go through that? Why would someone do that? Why not? Because it's there. If you have that one thing that you really really want to do and you get the opportunity to do it you'd be a fool to pass it up. Dragon's Lair on the TI-99-4A hardware trickery but it's stock system and it does exactly what it says it does. So I'm going to send it back over to you Rob over in the OLR studios. Maybe this will be a classic game of the week in 10 years since it just came out right now. And we're looking at some footage there that Bobby's closing the video up with. That looks great. I mean considering the hardware that it's on, that looks fantastic. That's great. So thank you so much Bobby for picking that up and checking that out for us there. That looked great. And I love that. I love the answer at the end there. Why do this? Why not? Well, I think that's a really good question. I think that's a really good question. I think that's a really good question. Why not? I love it. I think the moment that he said that it was unmodified I was sort of like holy shit. Yeah. That's well done. Well done. Kudos to everybody involved with that because the person that was being interviewed there was not the creator. Of course I'm sure you picked up there in the interview but I was representing the game and I just I love people that will go to the great lengths to kind of do those things and preserve the classics even if it's in these very like strange ways. So super cool. And what you didn't see in that video is that Bobby actually went out to the parking lot and keyed the car of the winner of that Dragon's Lair cartridge. So sorry to the oh no I'm obviously making all that up there. But good job Bobby not getting last last place in that contest. He was what? Fourth from last. What was the contest? Playing Dragon's Lair? I think he was trying to get a high score on that Dragon's Lair game. Yeah I would have lost that. If you're not used to playing it. Oh god. I did some contest a long time ago. I think it was like Stampede on the Atari 2600 at some. And it was like the official Twin Galaxies ranking or something. I was like third from last place. So I didn't know what the hell I was doing. But I thought it was cool because as I was doing it they were giving me tips on how to get better at it. So it's kind of neat. The way you get the highest score is you fake your video or you upload a fake score online and say that the video is gone. Now Bobby in chat says the guy who won the cartridge actually has the arcade cabinet so he knew everything. Well you know what? At least you know it's going to a good home. You know if somebody splurged the money for the arcade cabinet you know they're a fan of Dragon's Lair and so you know what? It's going to go to a good home. And maybe something you know I know we joke about could that be a classic game here in ten years on OLR the TI. I don't know if the original Dragon's Lair has surely been a classic game at some point. I don't know. I would think. But maybe not. Alright now do Space Ace. You know what really impressed me? Now you got to do Space Ace. No. Anyway. Thank you Bobby. Thank you for the segment and thank you for sharing that here on Orange Lounge Radio. Appreciate it. And if you guys have ideas for a break segment here at Orange Lounge Radio we are all ears. You can reach out to me directly on Twitter if you want at Mr Rob Roberts. That's MR Rob Roberts. And of course you can always reach the show on Twitter as well at OLR. And there's always good old fashioned email. Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com In the meantime let's get to some rapid fire news and travel. Oh thank you. Bobby says he will upload that to YouTube if the podcast audience wants to actually see what that looked like because you can hear the audio there especially at the end. You can only hear the audio and hear how you know again for a TI-9944A how faithful it is. But yeah hopefully you get to see that there. Thank you Bobby. Alright let's get into some rapid fire news and some quick other news that happened around the world this week. Yes. So let's talk a little bit about what's coming out for your free game. Well your games with paid subscription to online services. Not really free. I can't believe it's not free. Here's what's coming out on Xbox and on PlayStation. So Xbox One for May. We're getting Marooners from May 1st to the 31st and the Golf Club 2019 featuring PGA Tour from May 16th through the 15th of June. And then on the Xbox 360 which is also of course backwards compatible with Xbox One. Comic Jumper from May 16th to the 31st and last but not least Earth Defense Force Insect Armageddon on May 1st through the 15th. Definitely go check that out because it's awesome. It's a spin off but it's fun. I'll be sure to download that in your honor Loki since I know you don't have an Xbox One but I do. But I have that game on my Xbox 360 and I actually have that on PC too so you know. Like I would question it. Yes. And then of course this is pretty awesome but so For Honor they've got now of course since May the 4th was yesterday and that's a big Star Wars day so along with that in For Honor you can use now light sabers that aren't legally, legally not light saber but laser sword type weapons can be used and you can go check those out if you have that game. So laser weapons. Bright swords. Very bright swords. Sabers of lasers. That's true. I keep forgetting like yesterday was a Star Wars holiday. Using my quotey fingers but I guess like an actual thing in California was here and they made some honorary holiday you know not a real holiday but one of those like honorary holidays was like official in California now so it's kind of fun. Yeah. Which by the way you know happy single to my own I guess you know. I actually you know what's funny. It's revenge of the 5th. I I went to brunch with some friends this morning and it was you know I had to suggest the place because they suggested the place last time. So I was like oh let's go and I was just last night I was like oh Alan really likes that new taco bar place and there's a it opened up they just opened up one up in Folsom so let's go to the taco bar place. Not even thinking today's Cinco de Mayo. And I get up this morning and I go oh fuck it's Cinco de Mayo and I just suggested we go to the taco place. Oh yeah. Luckily we got there early enough it wasn't horrible but by the time we were leaving it was like a shit show waiting to get in. They had like the radio station out there doing promotions and everything. I should have gotten tacos today. It would have been probably cheaper. Yeah right. I forgot. Gosh. Alright moving on. Other rapid fire news. Let's talk about Anthem. Let's talk about a game that's kind of not done so well in the fan base. Well BioWare is reassuring folks that Anthem is not being abandoned even though it sure is starting to look that way because executive producer Mark Dara and lead producer Michael Gamble both have started working on other BioWare projects. And what's interesting Mark Dara over on Twitter at BioMarkDara said we aren't working on Dragon Age 3. We aren't working on Dragon Age 5 dot dot dot I guess that's that. Like just fucking pointing a laser sword right at the fact that the team has very clearly moved on to Dragon Age 4. Many of them. Well right cause you know Dragon Age 3 already came out. Well yeah of course. It was Inquisition. 3 was Inquisition if you didn't already know. Which was awesome. Anyway well hopefully Dragon Age 4 is awesome because but anyway it was very important also because even though some of these high profile folks have left BioWare is reaffirming commitment to Anthem's follow through on some of the shortcomings that they had earlier. So Michael Gamble in a tweet said there's been a lot of incorrect speculation on this. The studio's support and commitment to Anthem has not changed. Quoting a tweet from Chad Robertson at BioWare who said we remain 100% committed to Anthem and look forward to showing players the new content we're working on. We want to make sure we aren't over promising so our updates on what's coming in the game will be focused when we have things near completion. So my understanding is they put out a calendar that they haven't really been able to follow very well and just Anthem I just unfortunately like everything that we just kind of feared was going to happen with Anthem is happening and I think that's all we really need to say about that. Best of luck to the team and I hope they're able to make a Diablo 3-esque situation out of this but yeah. Anyhow let's move on and talk about a Kickstarter that met its goal this week. I think we brought this up on the show previously. Antstream is the Kickstarter. They met their goal. And I should disclose I ended up backing it. Somebody actually posted to Discord that they met their goal and that was the reminder to me I was like oh yeah shit I was supposed to go donate my money so I did and they've actually hit their first stretch goal which is going to be prioritized they don't want to over promise when Playstation 4 support is coming but they're prioritizing Playstation 4 support so that will be something that happens. If you are not familiar with Antstream it is a kind of trying to legalize what a lot of you are doing through ROMs and it's going to be allowing you to play games on the Amiga, the Commodore 64 Sega Genesis the ZX Spectrum because this is actually a company that's based over in Britain so obviously the ZX was a much bigger deal over there and Commodore was a huge deal over there too so they're focusing a lot on those systems but this will be out in the US as well they are saying and US people can back the Kickstarter which I think has 4 or 5 more days on it they showed some early alpha play on a recent charity stream overseas and that was when I watched that that really kind of sold me on it. They were playing Double Dragon and they were doing like challenges and one of the challenges they were doing was as many headbutts as they could in one segment of the game in 60 seconds and I thought those challenges were cool and something to add to retro that isn't already there because again I shouldn't be reading the comments section but my stupid ass always inevitably does and a lot of people taking issue with Antstream because the games are old people are emulating them anyway and you're fucking doing it illegally like you can sugar coat it all you want but technically you're not supposed to be doing that. It's just that you know they have an enforcer line. Here's the more valid criticism of Antstream that you know Antstream is streaming so you're not downloading the ROMs to your computer or your Xbox and playing them off that. You are streaming it like Google Stadia but again these games are not at 1080p 60 frames a second so I think there's a little more allowance. I think there's a lot of web pages that are probably larger than these games I mean I don't think that oh no I don't have you know the resolution of my gigabit is going to be a lot lower I'm not so worried about if it's going to kill bandwidth or not but I do understand some people a little more hesitant because of that but I also understand that that is one way to make the experience consistent between Xbox One and mobile phones and all that stuff so anyway you know but take what I'm saying with a grain of salt I just told you I backed it so you know now I guess I have an investment in it for whatever it's worth but I just I'm excited to play the Commodore 64 games in an environment that reminds me of the old GameTap which has a little more competition going with it just a little more fun in some old classic games I wanted to mention real quick since I forgot to mention Playstation for the month of May we're getting Overcooked and Edith Finch so those are the two games we're getting. Ooh Edith Finch such a good game. Yeah and Dartitsuya says Anstream is getting the rights to host these so I don't think there's any legality issues there. Nope and you know what they said people would never pay for music once Napster and LimeWire and all that was a thing and then iTunes came out charged a reasonable rate made it real easy and completely changed the industry and of course now we're in a day iTunes is still doing its thing but now it's probably more on that side Apple Music and Spotify and Pandora and everything in that streaming space ironically here we are talking about streaming that legitimizes it so anyway enough talk about that let's move on to another rapid fire story Dark Sakura Well it's finally happening and we've kept bringing it up but Bloodstained is happening yay Finally. Um so it looks like we have a release date for Xbox One, PS4 and PC that's gonna be on June 18th and the Switch version will be out on June 25th um but the time seems to have been just from what I you know I can tell that the extra development time should really make it a very stellar release. Did you see that trailer they put out recently that had like Igarashi in it going we heard that you thought the graphics were crap so we made it better it was very self aware again going back to what we kicked off the show with this week fan backlash causing changes. Well it does look really good. But yeah it is designed by Igarashi Koji who is such a rock star that was like the happy thing of my last E3 was getting to meet him and then of course the thing that actually I'm most excited about is the music because the music is done by Yamare Michiru who was the lady who did all the music for Symphony of the Night and Yamare Ippo who was Resident Evil musician so I'm really really looking forward to that also it's supposed to be like an even bigger castle like the largest one in any of Igarashi's games so I'm excited I might be a little bit more excited than I can safely keep us PG rated In this game my dick is bigger than ever with this castle right? Yeah his castle dick and then of course there's been this trailer floating around for Left 4 Dead 3 yeah it's fake It's fake. If you believe that Valve was doing a game with a 3 in it you were setting yourself up for failure. Yeah I believe someday that that's gonna happen and it'll be all of the games all the 3. Today is not that day. No. But you can pretty much you can look at it there's some other red flags that indicate that it's fake apart from Valve just denying it you know there's like licensed items in the game like Quaker Oats and they use like maps in it from some of the other games so yeah if you look at it you can tell but the only thing that we've really seen are just some like allegedly leaked environmental screenshots Didn't we have a story just like 2 or 3 weeks ago too that the Left 4 Dead team was working on it or like a lot of people that were involved with it were working on a very similar type of thing much akin to this burn out Destruction Derby or whatever that game is called they just put it out and I need to play it. Destructive Driving or something like that. Dangerous driving. Dangerous driving that's it. I'll be honest too. I went back to look at some of the screenshots and they don't look like they would be anything in a Left 4 Dead game like it's not anything that looks relatively modern unless it's like in Italy really damaged Italy or somewhere in the Middle East. Sorry I can't stop laughing Maybe Greece. I can't stop laughing now at calling that game Distracted Driving because now I'm just imagining a trailer that just shows like clips from burn out when you text on your phone and drive and then massive burn out you could cause an accident and by the way if anyone wants to see the images referred to it's a short URL so it's pronounced Imgur Imgur? Imgur.com a like alpha slash b like bravo c like Charlie capital w like whiskey lowercase f like foxtrot 6 j like juliet 8 Hope you write fast. It was Back 4 Blood was their game. Back 4 Blood thank you Well and marvel at my NATO alphabet skills yo Alright let's move on and I'll link this in the chat Let's find some things that are coming out soon as we look at some world release dates and some things that are coming out since Left 4 Dead 3 will not be Alright Well we're only getting a few games out this week so Life is Strange 2 Episode 3 Wasteland that's coming on PC PlayStation 4 and Xbox 1 Yakuza Kiwami 2 is out on PC and finally Saints Row 3rd coming out on Nintendo Switch That's it Alright and if we travel to Japan there's no releases in Japan this week I believe Golden Week was last week maybe wrapping up right now. I don't remember exactly Everyone's coming back I don't remember exactly how many days it is but regardless it would be similar to like the day after Christmas. You're not gonna see any games come out. If I'm correct in Golden Week one of the holidays involved in that has people going back to their hometowns so quite likely people would be coming back so no point in releasing anything. I mean it's a big deal there to like what Christmas is here when people travel and go they're gone for days and so forth so just like here Business is shut down. Yeah you don't get the game releases don't pick up until mid-January after Christmas maybe you get now we're getting to see one or two big ones that will come out in a couple weeks after but yeah anyway long story short no releases in Japan right now but there's good reason for it just with the culture over there so I will turn it over to Europe, Dark Sakura All of these come out on May 9th and all of them are for Switch so Farm Expert 2019 Mortal Kombat 11 and Saints Row the Third the full package An autoplay video on this site, sorry okay but that's all okay let's move on and we will go to the mailbag you guys send us emails participate at orange lounge radio dot com and we love to read these emails live on air and I believe we have one email tonight that we do saving you from Drag Race discussion yay thank you girl I got stuff to say about Silky I know justice for that email that sloppy bitch anyway hello L.R. I wanted to let Rob know that his memory has not failed him there was in fact a two versus two mode in Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 I knew it it was relatively basic there was no tagging in or out just the second member of a team appearing when the first was KO'd and the round ending when both members are KO'd it would still it was still best two out of three it wasn't played very often though since it cost double the price of an ordinary versus match and it didn't typically last twice as long I'm sure that a lot of folks forgot about it that is that everything is saying is correct but the arcade operator could set the price of that I think the default was double but I remember a place that was only like one credit to do that mode and it's a good way to like sample I mean the game had already been out for years at that point but it's a good way to sample multiple characters when you're like I don't know if I want to play Katana or Melina so you can do both so that's what was cool about it that would be team sibling rivalry yes team I think I'm a clone now personally I was far more interested in Ultimate Mortal Combat 3's eight player tournament mode which set up a single elimination tournament consisting of one round matches between eight players the thing cost eight credits to play but it was well worth it because when all the matches finished and a winner was crowned that person got to select any of the ending rewards available in the game including the supreme demonstration remember that the machine would play every single finishing move in the game which would take over seven minutes and he sent us a link that I'm going to post in chat her request we'll do a midpoint break some week where we just play the finishing move actually that would be a perfect bathroom break because it's seven minutes I never saw that mode I heard about it but I never saw that tournament mode ever actually get used so I have exactly once yeah so actually I love that you sent this email to kind of remind us I was like oh is that what it did or I guess that's one of the options but still that's really cool at any rate I just posted it in the chat and if we want to add it in to maybe show notes for posting the podcast so if I remember I'll do my best it's a YouTube so I'm sure if you just Google it it's a tube of the you yes or are you sure you don't want me to read the URL girl it's a lot more complicated than what I read anyway thanks again for the show and have a great week hugs Aaron YYR well thanks thanks for that I'm always down to talk about the old school Mortal Kombats well I don't know it's just sort of been like I've been in this like crazy Mortal Kombat nostalgia if you go to my fan page which is Dark Sakura I will link it in chat for those here wink wink nudge nudge nudge nudge like my status well not just that actually follow my page but I linked the old making of Mortal Kombat so which is pretty cool it's just basically how they did a lot of the mocap this is a very cool watch I mean it also talks into just how primitive their mocap techniques were back then and how it's evolved to what we have now so yeah that was the only other email so thank you YYR Toshin a blast from the past in our chat tonight good to see you is in our chat saying a good thing the new arcade 1up cabs out now make the modes more accessible you know I gotta say if I'm a really good boy on my spending I think I'm gonna buy myself one of those cabinets I just I want it I don't I want it there's just no other explanation I want it I want the Tempest one but Black Knight sort of rage oh yeah that's right you got that Dan's like we'll be fine with the pro fuck no it's not Black Knight without having the second play field I want a fucking premium stomp my foot Veruca Salt moment Bob Coffee in chat says the arcade 1up cabinets are okay yeah I know they're not like the real thing and they're smaller and it's a different type of screen I want one! I think those are bigger though aren't those what they have like I think a little I thought that they were bigger because I know that like the Atari ones and stuff they have like a pedestal that you put the cabinet on to make them taller but I thought those were just already taller because I mean children aren't gonna be playing moral combat it's a mature rated game right yeah sure you wouldn't let your kids play it would you? they wouldn't be interested exactly I probably would let them but they wouldn't be interested this is too hard I just remember though the biggest hype about any Mortal Kombat ever in my experience was Mortal Kombat 2 and this was the year that we were taking the trip up the east coast for my high school band we actually played at Carnegie Hall and that was when all the beta machines were still out all up the east coast so we were like which beta is this? and we had everyone would have like three different print outs based on the beta version that we would try to figure out what we were playing yeah I remember the first time I saw Mortal Kombat 2 my mind was blown I saw it at like a bowling alley and like you know I'm sure we all saw the first game and played it but like the second one was like somehow the graphics were even better even though it was still that whole like digitized people thing and it was just like my mind was blown like so good so and then I remember seeing the third game for the first time and I was also like wow this looks like really different but I don't know even as much as I enjoy the third game like it just it wasn't the same as 2 I don't know what it is 2 just had like the magic that 1 built yeah cause 1 is kind of hard to go back and play it because it was a very slow game I think 3's biggest problem was taking Sub-Zero's mask off it just didn't feel the same yeah but 2 had all the charm and violence of 1 but it was at a more playable speed it was a faster game alright anyhow ok well our mailbag segment turned into Mortal Kombat talk but hey that's ok let's move on to some more news alright now Loki now what does it say up there now what can we talk about at this point in the show fine I'm sure you have some choice things to say to me right so Microsoft you know well aware that their Xbox Live service is full of the best people so they decided that they're gonna put out acceptable trash talk examples what I hadn't heard and what not to do when you're trash talking so for example some things that you shouldn't say hey profanity that was some serious potato aim get wrecked trash who the fuck talks like that? nobody talks like that that was a very potato reading get wrecked trash the only reason you went positive was you spent all game camping kys kid ok well you shouldn't tell children to kill themselves you know what kys means right yes I gather yes kiss your savior kiss your savior cheap win totally expected from a racial slur racial slurs are not ok I'm not gonna make fun of that one they do need to get rid of those but anyways yeah so they have this whole website and they actually broke it down by like different categories of like how what you should and should not do like attitude and standards keep it legal attitude check anyone? says Xbox Lives Ville in all countries for example you know build a club around illegal drug use don't do that create messages that encourage underage drinking don't do that tell other players to kill themselves or commit self harm don't do that upload custom gamer pics that show animal abuse why would you do that for example don't spam into substance turning spam into substance regularly offering prizes in exchange for follows let's see what stuff we should be doing so trash talk I'm sorry I love this comment about KYS OBS B4L Uncle Joe sorry if I'm butchering your name says KYS kiss your sister sure thing if you're a Lannister no we don't talk about that show we don't talk about the competition Dar Sakura it's Sunday night you know what people can do both and then actdeft follows up and says hey everybody TYS treat yourself I love that if somebody says KYS I just want you to think TYS treat yourself here at OLR we want you to TYS treat yourself I'm gonna buy that Mortal Kombat 3 cabinet why TYS or like here's what you shouldn't do you suck get out of my country maybe they'll let you back when your KD's over one here's what you should say get destroyed can't believe you thought you were on my level that was some serious potato aim get rekt so I can say that was potato aim get rekt cheap win come at me when you can actually drive without running cars off the road hey I take that personally I can't keep the car on the road and you know what if they didn't want me to drive off road they wouldn't let me drive off road make stuff suitable for all audiences for example don't upload a custom gamer pic that contains nudity share send loot messages to other players hey you want to slide into my DMs TYS harmful behavior that has no place on Xbox for example use mods that explicitly support it or that are not explicitly supported by game developers you wouldn't mod your game would you exploit to duplicate in-game items don't do that bad people connect modified or tampered hardware to the Xbox Live god this sounds lame how about I do none of those things we know that Xbox Live is this forever punchline about that it's just trash when you go on there and you use voice chat so I understand that Microsoft is under some pressure to do literally anything about it so this is that like it's it's something it may not be much but I know I've learned the term potato aim I'm gonna use that in a sentence at some point that's how that's how I play overwatch with my potato aim straight Idaho potato aim anyway Mr. Smoosh is yelling in the other room that I have potato aim right now be right back I have to go cuddle him against his will Bobby Blackwolf in chat says my potato aim is so bad it's not even from Idaho so like I'm trying to understand what they I'm trying to fill in their blanks here so get sexual threat can't believe you thought you were on my level like get fucked is that like a sexual threat either get fucked or get what you would call if you force sex upon someone against their will I've I've heard of that one being uh flinged around on Xbox Live and it's not okay just to be explicitly clear so anyway again Microsoft has to do something but yeah at the end of the day if they're not gonna ban people for being fuckheads which I guess maybe I'm not supposed to say but when you do say these types of things you are in fact being a fuckhead so what about just say get consensually fucked like well I don't know I don't because that that's no I anyway moving on let's talk let's talk about a company that is banning some fools uh respawn behind apex legends of course y'all playing some apex legends well uh 770,000 of you just got banned congratulations although I would guess this is probably not 770,000 individual people this is probably 770 trolls with 1000 accounts or something along those lines anyhow uh respawn did I was kind of looking at this going didn't we kind of already have this and yeah this is a follow up because respawn did they said we've still got plans to deal with cheaters we're not gonna tell you what those plans are because we don't want you circumventing it so it has to be a little bit vague but there was another blog post that said uh the recent added in-game reporting tools had a big impact on discovering new cheats including previously undetectable cheats that are now being found automatically via EAC what's EAC is that EAC's cheat controller is that an acronym for something else EAC it's gotta be some probably some yeah uh anyway total bands are now at 770,000 players we've blocked 300,000 account creations we've banned 4,000 cheat seller accounts spammers in the last 20 days total matches on PC impacted by cheaters or spammers has been reduced by over half in the last month due to recent efforts in a quote here from Drew McCoy the executive producer it is a constant war with the cheat makers that we will continue to fight we take cheating in Apex Legends incredibly seriously and have a large amount of resources tackling it from a variety of angles uh saying he will be back next week with an update on another one of these issues called out in last week's post so you better look out cause uh Drew McCoy and the rest of the uh Apex team is coming for you and stop cheating in multiplayer games like if you want to cheat in a single player game or if you want to form your own little instance with your friends where you're all consensually cheating and all that stuff fine go off have fun but like don't inflict that stuff on strangers who just want to play the game and have a good time alright calm down so anyway um yeah it's true SD100 Matt says trolls find a way active says trolls gonna troll uh DJ Rama S says EAC is something called easy anti cheat so I'm just I'm not familiar with the uh term there so alright well uh yeah don't don't be a jerk in Apex Legends that's the that's the thing to take away from this but it is an extremely popular online game right now like I don't is it still outperforming Fortnite or how is that all calm down on Twitch I don't know haven't looked at the rankings lately probably pretty close it's it's still up there until the next thing comes out you can't ignore how uh what a big game it is right now speaking of big games whether Bobby Blackwolf wants to believe it or not there's still a big one out there on mobile right DarkSakura? there's the Pokemans uh there is a uh release of actually a confirmation of information the Pokemon Go community basically investigated into the new late guardians but Niantic actually did announce that Uxie Mesprite and Azelf whatever names um are all going to be available via region specific raids through May 27th they were random spawns they were hard to find but now you can get them from your raids Asia Pacific is gonna get Uxie Eastern sorry European Union Middle East Africa India gets Mesprite and America and Greenland get Azelf so there you go there the late guardians from gen 4 now I know they haven't confirmed this yet but my assumption is that these guys are gonna rotate cause didn't the dogs from gen 2 they did the same thing like one region got you know one dog another got you know another and then they rotated so like this should be like the next three months worth of raids right yeah that's my assumption anyway so interesting uh I have yet to catch one you know I as much as you know we tease Bobby Blockwolf and I know he's teasing us right back when he says hashtag dead game and we're like no it's not um I I do notice that like the raid scene is kinda it's at least around me it's kinda slowing down cause I think people are just getting a little burned out kinda feels like it's just like the same thing and the Pokemon aren't that exciting and there's so many events I'm not sure what the game could do to really wake people up I don't know if the secret is just release gen 5 I don't know do you think there's something Pokemon Go could do to get people kinda like back interested in it again make it competitive yeah I mean they have PVP well they have PVP but it's kinda it's very much a side show you know what I mean I don't know I think it's fun right now uh oh Totion in chat says Niantic said no rotation right now what I think they really want people to trade for that stuff you're gonna have to really be able to trade long distance stuff I think they're gonna end up doing the rotation or they'll they'll make it like quest rewards or something like that I don't know that's probably what's gonna end up happening we'll see or maybe you'll have to get real lucky and catch them in the wild which apparently has been a thing going on alright well Loki along the Pokemon lines yeah so they're doing this brand new app that's coming out now called Pokemon Pass which is gonna be separate from Pokemon Go but you can actually get Pokemon much like you did in the 3DS or the DS at different locations they'll unlock different things like for example the first thing that's gonna be available is on May 11th and if you have Pokemon Let's Go with the app it'll allow you to unlock a shiny Pikachu or shiny Eevee for Let's Go so that's if you go to Target and use your app there ok wait so you're gonna have to scan a QR code? I think so that's it? like you use this app to scan a QR code and so I have to go to Target to get that QR code gosh there's no possible way a QR code that correct me if I'm wrong never changes right Loki it's just gonna be the same QR code on like a cardboard I don't know that yeah there's no way that like I don't know if somebody could take like a picture of that and put it on the internet and I could just scan my monitor if it's like a poster up on the wall yes if it's like an app or something like in the store like a kiosk or something that generates a unique QR code for you then perhaps ok that's gonna be a little harder yeah let's think about the minimal viable product here it's gonna be a fucking poster and that'll be up on the internet immediately and yeah cause that's what happened with the um god what was that game that was trying to compete against Pokemon yokai watch ok so yokai watch had QR codes in it right and there was kind of like a similar thing with the anime I think had QR codes in it you could like scan it in the anime yeah that shit was on the internet in days you know hours minutes you know it's just not yeah I'm sure that's what's gonna happen with Pokemon pass as well but hey I hey I'm all for extra things and extra perks in these games fun right why not yeah we'll see maybe if if they then and act F and chat is telling me about the last story with the Pokemon rights they'll keep them regional since they'll still be appearing in the wild maybe I'll have to use a QR code to get them maybe that'll be the thing who knows we'll see what Pokemon pass lends itself to later act F says the QR is already on the internet well that didn't take long uh and maybe you know what maybe this is how they plan to do the legendary distributions uh for the gen 8 games for um I already forget the name sword and shield and gun this is how they plan to distribute for sword and shield is that they're gonna use this app and do it instead of those game stop cards with the codes who knows anyway alright uh one more story I think for you guys before we get to the listener round tables if you want to call into the show you can join our discord vog network.com slash discord and we'll be uh looking for some calls in the green room if you want to give us a shout to what you want to talk about tonight just uh mention it in channel orange lounge radio so again vog network vognetwork.com slash discord but uh our last official story tonight has to do with a game that's pretty old at this point but it was on a ton of uh it was like on PC it was on the original Wii it was on it was all over it's a game called World of Goo well World of Goo got a PC update this week and that game hasn't been updated in probably 10 years what's interesting about this update this isn't some little like bug fix all these years later update or things like that actually what's really cool about this it changes the resolutions to now do a 16 by 9 display because when the game came out 4 by 3 was a little bit more of the standard and it has an HD makeover because the original resolution of the game only ran at 800 by 600 so no no HD version no no remaster just an update to World of Goo to make it better I should point out though no new levels no new challenges they didn't really change anything in the game but still very cool that they are updating it to support more modern PCs so hooray for that a polite applause for a game maker willing to go back and update their very old game but again I think a lot of people probably own this because they just it was so many sales and so many things of that nature and so forth I'm just uh very very uh happy to see that so alright so anyway um oh gosh okay I don't I don't usually read these on air I don't usually read all these at once because it kind of derails the show a little bit but this is a big one and plus we're getting into the listener round table anyway so it's appropriate to read it this time um but I do want to acknowledge this we just got 3,500 biddies from that's a lot of biddies we just got 3,500 biddies from uh schmagtastic in our chat saying um and I hope I said your name right I'm sorry if I butchered it especially after what a sweet gesture that is saying this podcast was literally my adolescence and has transcended into my adulthood again just extending my gratitude to you all for such a great community and podcast so allow me to express my gratitude for you uh for for doing that and uh thank you um it's and it's not just about the biddies I mean don't get me wrong appreciate it but uh just even just saying that just the fact that we've had that impact on somebody in some sort of little way just means a lot that's it always kind of blows me away like for one that we've been doing this show as long as we have and the other is just like how many people have really stuck with us for um as long you know and I realized people come and people go and I I know I name checked um toshin earlier in the show who was kind of like I think a listener back in the like all games days which was a while ago at this point right Boggs been around since about 2012 um and so all games when did all games start all games started I think around 2006 well I'm sorry when we joined all games around before that you know what I mean um our time with them started in like 2006 so I mean just to think like oh my god like they were listening I'm a PSP how many years are really shminktastic was on the beat I'm telling you that PSP thing doesn't get enough credit I would say that that OLR PSP rest in peace because it's sadly it's no longer there because I mean why would it be but that OLR PSP probably brought more people to OLR than anything else in our history save for the launch of iTunes podcasting and us being one of the original shows in it that's probably the only thing I can think of there that really comes close so yeah that's and there's so many folks in chat yeah OLR PSP I listen on the PSP too fuck I wish I could make lightning strike twice too bad there wasn't an OLR Vita but it wasn't really the same thing on the Vita the PSP was different because we were really able to build something there that really felt like you were like unlocking a new ability within your PSP you know what I mean with the whole listing on shoutcast like a lot of people didn't really know how to do that and you made it so easy with that website and it looked really cool and was like built for a PSP of mine that I just think like yeah again anyway I just is it on like one of those like web archives or something the OLR PSP site it's gotta be like there's gotta be a way for you guys to see it and what it like for those have no idea what I'm talking about if you're like newer to the show because it really was for for the time it was really cool I'm actually trying to learn Swift so I can make an iOS app oh that'd be sweet for us I I'm just starting my research so I mean to be fair maybe all of fog network would want an app but yeah you know I started I mean I had started on the idea like a few years ago yeah it's just that they've changed so many things since then you gotta stay on top of that stuff it's outdone before you even know it so anyway big big thank you for that and yeah Bobby agrees it was worth breaking the rules for and I'm okay with that I really really am yeah I can post a link there's a way back oh is there is on the way back machine yeah sweet post that in chat that's awesome I love that anyway we are I did not get the studio on the freaking discord server actually before I take calls we do have at least one person in the green room did you want to do any last minute stories I know I had to cut sure I can talk about there do you like one story then we get to you remember that we talked a little bit about the overwatch kind of was it the thing that they were doing for the the mods and stuff like that so someone actually created of course a portal gun in there so now you can have your portal fun along with the as one of the game types in overwatch now so that's kind of neat that they have that that's cool I forgot to mention during my gaming week I actually played overwatch which I haven't played in a while but I was like oh shit that special event is about to run out and I haven't even done it yet so I went in and I did like the story mode and the use any hero mode and all that and the opening movie is kind of long this time but it's well done it's good I just wish like there's seriously only one character in the story mode version that I can play half decently and that's mercy I guess if if I was forced to I could kind of do Winston but I am terrible with Genji and Tracer terrible so but I mean I think it's cool that that's okay I'm terrible at the entire game that's fair let me answer that since you can ask questions in chat as well and then we'll get to a call here schmaketastic wants to know is Loki still doing any game coding last I heard he was messing around with C++ or something it's been a few months since I've tuned in well let me tell you so I guess some good notes the kid has written more games at this point than Loki has the kid the kid is doing coding actually which is pretty amazing and I hope at some point he'll have a game that we want to say hey y'all should go check this out we made a game about John Cena memes it was pretty awesome he's kind of gotten done with doing John Cena stuff in fact that's actually it's funny like we were no we had that conversation the other day about like um because the owner of the I always talk to the owner of the place when I'm there and he's like yeah I've noticed that he's stopped putting John Cena in every single one of his games that he submits so so he's doing like no he he finished one now it's it was called Dragon Racing so they had the like you have the race dragon around like a little track thing he has to do one now it's called uh because Ninja Invaders it's basically he has to create a ninja character that move you move and avoid like stuff coming towards it kind of like a space shooter avoid object thing so he has to work on that so he's got about like he's about halfway through the white belt course and then he's gonna go through that he has to do some robotic stuff and then there's some they call improve yourselves which is basically here's a challenge but we're not gonna tell you how to do it you have to do it based on all of the knowledge that you have and it's kind of like a test and once he does that then he moves to yellow belt which is then um JavaScript so he's gonna start getting in JavaScript and you guys have to remember because if you haven't listened in a while you might not recall Loki's kid is eight yeah eight years old and this this is what they're doing now when I was eight years old we were plunking around on an Apple 2e doing logo not the television network the pen down forward 30 pen up when I was eight years old I was learning French if I look if I look here I probably could post a couple of his games in chat because I get linked on them every single time that he uh he goes in there I just they go into that parent portal and I can show you some of the stuff he's been working on but it's cool it's not not to make fun of him or anything a lot of it's very obnoxious it's a kid usually when we like laugh at that stuff it's like oh my gosh I can't believe what kids are doing I can't believe like what kids like are are into but as far as your own personal coding uh you have he has yet to release anything that uh is is I did see the time to car thing I did get to see that at one point it's on YouTube oh yeah that's right you did put it on YouTube it's on it's on my YouTube channel uh YouTube Lokiolar you can check it out it's really old the reason I didn't release it because it wasn't fun and I had I would have had to I wanted to redo the whole thing I just it kind of got like it I lost the scope of what I was trying to do with it and then it just became too weird and so I decided to um I'm not gonna work on it until I have a clear idea of what I'm gonna do so I'm working on something else right now instead all right well let's get to some calls uh or at least a call because we do have somebody uh waiting there in the green room that wants to be on the show so let's bring them on hello you're on Orange Laundry Radio who's this you're out this is Metal Mayhem well hello Metal Mayhem what's on your mind tonight I just called you mayhem I called you a may-ham ham sorry about it may-ham mayhem well better than June beef right all right what's on your mind tonight uh well since you kind of sort of touched it on briefly in passing now a short while ago I thought I'd call about arcade 1-up um now you know I haven't seen these machines in person myself but obviously you and Loki and uh Dark Soccer have so um my question is for a little exposition obviously I know they're gonna be a little bit different than the actual arcade originals they're gonna be smaller chances are they don't accept quarters or tokens or anything like that but even with that being said now if you're not in the position to get the actual arcade machine for one ever reason you know would you recommend you know people go out and get these machines is like uh alternative to the original machine um as an alternative to the original machine it depends if you're a collector I don't think anything's gonna replace the original machine as far as like collector value and goes but if you're just somebody like looking to enhance your game room or your fun space like a like especially like maybe if you have like a community game room if you have like a HOA or an apartment complex or something has like a standard game room and you're looking to like enrich that a little bit I think one of these machines would be really like an adorable way to do that now since you haven't seen them in person but by the way my well at least a local Walmart to here has them on display now I don't think that means every Walmart has them on display but I know one near here does so if you have a large Walmart near to you somewhere um you might be able to go and uh see that so I check that out and also um Costco here sells them now I don't have a Costco membership but somebody sent me a text the other day going hey I thought of you because I saw this at Costco so I know they're selling them there too is Costco nationwide nationwide or is that just west coast they're nationwide okay they're nationwide so check that too um so you may be able to see one in person if you if you head to one of those stores I imagine they're going to be showing up more places soon because there's really no describing it like seeing one in person although you could probably see some YouTubes and they probably do a good job at explaining it as well um they are smaller they're not like the original cabinet um because I would say imagine more like a bar top if you've ever been to a bar and you see something that's like kind of like sitting on top of the bar it's kind of more like that but it's probably like I would say it has a little more height to it it kind of goes up a little bit it's a little more skinnier like an arcade cabinet but it goes up a little bit and then um you know it's just not the size of a full size it's meant to be put like on the bar and then you sit there on a stool and play the game that way it's not meant to be something you put on the ground because if you put it on the ground it wouldn't come up past your kneecaps okay whereas the original arcade machine would come up the full size um the thing I noticed right off the bat as being very different is the monitor because they have a very kind of like cheap but modern monitor in there and I think one thing you have to remember is that a lot of these games like Mortal Combat like I don't know what are even in these things Crystal Castles like old school Asteroids, Tempest those type of games they all played on CRT televisions and that's not what's powering these things these are like flat screen TVs in those so that's the first thing I noticed that's different is that oh this looks different because it's not like a CRT which is a very kind of distinct look to it versus you know a more modern flat screen television so I think for me right there that's like the biggest difference you're going to notice but that's also how they make these things not cost a couple thousand dollars which if you're a collector trying to collect a machine I don't know Jamie you may know more about this than I do I know you guys collect pinball machines and not arcade machines but do you have any idea like ballpark what an 80's arcade machine might cost somebody? Depends on the machine I mean really because it depends on rarity it depends on if it is a mod a lot of machines were modded and people will buy the modded machines and try to restore them back to original when we picked up our pole position now it was in shitty condition but we picked up our pole position for I want to say 200 that's not bad yeah it was pretty crappy I remember Shermie lived in it for a little while remember yeah I do I do and you guys put a main thing in that right we did we did we also now keep in mind our gyrus was free because it needed a fuse replaced and the owner didn't want to do it or you didn't know how to fix it we got our blastroids I want to say for 50 I mean we've since sold both of these now I think for 500 for the pair because we needed room but I mean it just really depends a good way actually to learn some of these prices is a channel that Dan and I watch is TNT Amusements out on the East Coast I'm trying to remember where exactly but you know he'll go through and he'll say what the prices you know they show some of the repair process on some of the machines and they talk about the pricing and you know what a discounted price would be and what he picks up these things for and the work that goes into him I get a really good gauge just watching his YouTube channel so now I do want to respond because I'm finally looking at chat and some of the input you guys are making there first off Costco is apparently not just nationwide but it's in Mexico too according to Act F so it's international so I really don't know what I'm talking about and then let's see S2100 Matt I thought had some good advice here your best bet for getting machines at a good price look for auctions sometimes you'll get a good deal I remember YYR got his DDR machine for a good price at an auction so that's that's a good way to think about it too not that I'm saying you're running out there to collect arcade machines Metal Mayhem but you never you never know especially sometimes it's just about like who you know and what have you just like Dark Tips I'm sorry I'm looking for chat while I'm talking Dark Sakura I'm looking at chat while I'm Dark Sakura mentioned that they got a free one just because you know lazy owner space as far as the owner was concerned you'd be surprised where you can find stuff I found my DDR cabinet on Facebook marketplace so yeah wow I got a great deal on that it's crazy I did a little bit of basic research for actual arcade machines being sold in my area for those that don't remember or are relatively new to the show I live in the western New York area and you know the cities in western New York are nowhere as big as Sacramento or LA or anything like that so my choices for places that sell are rather limited and now the ones that I constantly see being advertised they have been restored and whatnot typically regardless of the machine they're being sold for roughly two and a half grand as much as I would like an actual same working order and all that two and a half bands way out of my price range so I kind of figure if I can't do two and a half grand if I remember right you said these arcade one ups are being sold for roughly about two hundred dollars right? I can't figure two hundred dollars is still a little bit of a stretch about two hundred dollars is still way more affordable it's doable it's about the same price what a console would cost you you're only going to get a handful of games so they have to be games that really mean something to you but it could be worth it yeah if I like if I really go and save up like living on nothing but ramen and air and water for like years then maybe just maybe with a little luck maybe I can pass away for the actual arcade machine at like two and a half grand but I wouldn't hold my breath on that I don't think any arcade machine is worth starving yourself for but you know if you you find things in your budget to cut back on you'd be surprised how long am I to err how not so long am I taking to save for some things you know what I mean I mean you know the computer that I'm on right now you know that was relatively cheap but I literally had to live on like a shoe sticking out budget for like three months to get to get the money for that and that was only like roughly four hundred fifty dollars so yeah all right well you know I took away too much of the time so I'll clear up reliance for somewhere else so you know I was calling but thanks for taking my call don't worry about it it was a good topic you take care okay you too take care yep all right so we are about to get to our next call here dar Tutsi agreeing in our chat yeah the one ups might be good if you don't want to get your hands dirty with repairs all right well we're going to take another call here I see another person in the green room so I'm going to bring him into the on air channel and say hello you're on orange launch radio who's this hey it's make tastic hey hi there you're the one that just sent that very kind donation thank you so much how can how can I not take your call tonight how are you oh it's no worries I'm doing great little under the weather but yikes yeah just I don't have anything relevant topic wise to say but just wanted to say you know I've been listening since I was 15 back when RSS feeds on the PSP were still a thing I'm 28 now so that kind of dates me a little bit there but uh I think my first memory of you all was uh when you weren't mentioning how long you all have been on the air or a podcast rather and dark soccer held up her fingers and said we're this many and you were all like oh yeah great radio dark soccer they're holding up your fingers isn't isn't that ironic now that we're on twitch so dark soccer hold up how many fingers with how old the show is they can't see they can't see that no we're more than one dark multiply that by 17 all right noted noted yeah with love with love I've called in and emailed in under several different aliases could never really stick to one so this is one I actually can stick to because I've had it since I was a teenager but um yeah I mean I've called I remember emailing in one day when I was a teen and real lonely angsty teen and how I sent in an email stating how the show really got me through the day when my dog died stuff like that I just uh I just want to thank you all for uh keeping at it for this long too that's just kind of unprecedented I mean I kind of I kind of joke about this sometimes but the story that you kind of gave there is that like I've been listening since I was 15 and now I'm 28 you know it's it's it's like the best thing to hear at the same time being the worst thing to hear right yeah it's kind of uh no but I love it I love no I do I do like but the fact that uh we just make fun of it because it's obviously a reminder of like oh yeah I was 24 when I started this and now I'm um not um but uh don't even the the fact that many of you have stuck with this as long as you have I mean it's it's the reason why we keep showing up on Sunday night you know we're not we're not a huge show we don't we don't got the ratings a giant bomb or um I don't what are even the big gaming podcast I don't even know anymore a lot of them just kind of come and go but anyway because y'all are technically first podcast I ever listened to so I don't want to say anything even remotely shady about gamertag though because Danny was very hard at what he does and deserves the success that he's getting and he's another indie guy so like I can't I can't shade or hate on that in any single way uh but I will always throw shade at the corporate people involved um so uh yeah but um gosh thank you thank you so much for um just being here and and uh being with us and giving us the motivation to show up like people people often ask us like how do you keep going for 17 years and there's several different well I mean you say that well you say that tongue in cheek but there's definitely a part of me that goes like the Sunday nights when OLR isn't here when something pre-planned isn't going on like um let's say like we had a show cut out because of a technical issue or something like I I really didn't want to take the show off but we had like a technical issue or something um and it just feels weird I'm like sitting there going what do I do I guess I'll watch Game of Thrones or something no I'm not even that bored so you know it's like I don't know what to do um but just also the fact that there's so many of you out there and I say so many and again it's not like thousands and thousands it's maybe dozens and dozens but that's still something to me the fact that even one person would like turn up and like give a shit about our discussions that we're having here and our stories and our angles and things like that like that's just like that's all the motivation in the world and that's something that's kept this show being fed for 17 years and we'll keep the show being fed until one day we just have to pull the plug for whatever reason whatever that reason may be that I don't want to think of yet right you know I've dropped in and out of several different podcasts but this has been the one that I've stuck with for 12 years now I mean granted I'm never as consistent as I would like to be but you know y'all have been my getting me through you know to my commute to work and my commute home from where you know just always hearing your voices is a good thing and you guys really put on a great show and I just wanted to extend my gratitude well thank you so so much it's like super appreciated and you know I really do appreciate that thank you yeah if you can't listen every week it's like totally okay like you know some people will say like oh man I haven't been able to listen to OLR in like three months and I'm like it's cool like it really is like don't feel like you owe me an apology or something I'm here doing my thing with with our soccer and Loki and if you're able to make it out cool if not hey it happens but as I usually say at the end of the show and I'll just kind of remind everybody of it now if if OLR you decide one day it's not really for you anymore for whatever reason I just hope you support independent podcasts and please please please do not support celebrity podcasts that want to charge you $7.99 a month for the privilege of being able to listen to it that's all I'm going to say for the record if you do decide the podcast is no longer for you would like to know why honestly enough because I'm a firm believer that a complaint is a gift and if you have a problem with something that we do or say it'd be better to tell us right off the bat hopefully you know where we can discuss it so that you know we know what people aren't liking but to be clear because I have read some of those like iTunes reviews and things like that those don't count yeah things like Dark Soccer is a bitch or have there been more of those Rob not in years or Rob is annoying or whatever Loki is too loud or you play too much Pokemon Go like those things aren't going to help you know what I mean whatever yeah not very constructive criticism but it's also glad to hear that Dark Soccer is still playing Animal Crossing I'd like to think that Loki is still modding the shit out of GTA 5 or something um something I love my Animal Crossing though I'm so waiting for the Switch one right well uh that's really all I wanted to say guys so just keep kicking ass you're not already a hologram? alright I'll show you hologram take care shmaktastic thanks for being here later that was great alright I think we'll end on that note we're going to end on a happy note tonight although I will ask Loki if there's any other last minute stories he wants to see tonight nah I've been just watching videos of this of Dreams the medium molecules posting little big planet but PS4 yeah the stuff that people are doing in like the past right now this game is going to catch a lot of people off guard it looks amazing I can't wait to play it but I feel like this they're not really explaining like when the game comes out I feel like it's like this secret thing that like you have to be part of the cool kids club to know like when when when can I walk into a target and buy the fucking game that's what I would like to know I don't know but it looks it looks awesome yeah it does look awesome like I'm all here for it but like you know let me buy your game that's all I'm asking I'm sure we'll see it at E3 well maybe cause Sony's not there so they might put something out they can just show this for the whole presentation alongside it I don't know they might do a direct-ish style thing I don't know we'll see anyway that does bring us to the end of another episode of Orange Lawn Radio but we want to thank you guys for being here tonight and thank you for listening to our show and as we were saying there on that call if you enjoyed the show you know well actually I said if you don't enjoy the show what to do but if you do enjoy the show please tell a friend help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice but if the voices aren't here we can't air them auto hosts on Twitch TV for VoG network go a long way we super appreciate those if you consider adding VoG network to your auto host list a nice five star review wherever you found this show whether it be iTunes or Google podcast or wherever all of those really really go a long way and we super appreciate it I guess that's all we have to say on that end so let's go around and get everybody's final thought DarkSakura why don't we start with you your final thought tonight I don't think I have one just people need to learn that communication is very important that's all and Loki your final thought my final thought is I'm going to try to stream something this week because I've got a lot of opportunity to do that so we'll see and my final thought tonight is I don't have a lot to say I'm grateful we have new microphones there's hopefully we all sounded good tonight and that that was a worthy investment and thank you all for being here I think that last call just really summed it up perfectly it was a very feel good fuzzy way to end the show tonight thank you guys so much for being here and being part of this our little family here at Orange Lounge Radio as we come up on episode 777 which I guess is a landmark of sorts because it is that show that we joked about in the early days of O.L.R. we're not going to get to 777 episodes oops oops alright
