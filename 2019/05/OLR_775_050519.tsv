7000	14000	Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
14000	18000	This week, Microsoft defines some tolerable speech and MOBAs punish intolerable cheaters.
18000	22000	If social issues are getting to be too much, why not use your Nintendo Switch to write a program instead?
22000	28000	These are just some of the stories we'll discuss tonight, starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.
28000	33000	Orange Lounge Radio
33000	38000	Hello, my friends out there on the internet. Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
38000	47000	It is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight with episode number 775 for this May the 5th of 2019.
47000	53000	My name is Rob Roberts joining studio by the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
53000	55000	Well, you're going to have to do something special for 777.
55000	61000	I know. Well, you know, there was a there was a Bomani song because our show is rooted in, you know, music gaming culture.
61000	66000	There's a Bomani song called 777. And I think the plan was always, oh, we're just going to play that song.
66000	69000	But now it's holy. Well, and now we can't.
69000	74000	So we might have to like record ourselves playing it and guitar freaks somehow and then like play that.
74000	78000	I don't know. I don't know what you do or we do a Vegas themed thing.
78000	81000	I don't know. We make it extra sinful.
81000	85000	Golden casino night. Hello, Techmaster Loki, by the way. Hello, I'm here.
85000	89000	The classic game of the week is Vegas Stakes by who did that?
89000	94000	Was that how for Super Nintendo? I think it was the people that went on to make Smash Brothers all those years later.
94000	98000	So that should be another character like, you know, one of the slot machines,
98000	103000	the Vegas dude, the girl that comes up to try to loan you money or try to convince you to loan her money.
103000	106000	And sometimes they pay you back and sometimes they run away with it.
106000	110000	We'll just fight the Vegas showgirl and proteus over and over and over and over.
110000	113000	I hope people know what I'm talking about in that game, by the way.
113000	116000	It was kind of a niche, like Super Nintendo game, but I thought it was awesome.
116000	119000	Anyway. OK, good. I'm not alone.
119000	122000	Looking in our chat room over at twitch.tv slash vog network,
122000	125000	where we do tape live every Sunday night at the voice keeps network vog
125000	127000	network dot com right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.
127000	130000	Six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern. OK, thank you.
130000	135000	Vid Power says, yay, Vegas. I think that's just because the power is in Vegas.
135000	137000	The break man, though, says, oh, shit, I love that game.
137000	141000	And Bobby Blackwell says, I enjoyed Vegas Stakes. There you go.
141000	144000	Hopefully, by the way, if you're listening to last week's show,
144000	146000	you might have heard that we had some live audio issues going on,
146000	149000	which, you know, say lovey things are going to happen.
149000	152000	That's the year that that's why you all turn out for a live show.
152000	156000	And we put it out on the podcast feed warts and all the way that we recorded it.
156000	160000	So we had some mic issues. So hopefully you guys are going to find that those are gone tonight
160000	164000	because Dark Soccer and myself have some brand new microphones.
164000	168000	So we went out on a shopping adventure earlier this week and picked up some microphones.
168000	170000	They probably look different on stream as well.
170000	173000	So, you know, the other ones that we had before, they were great.
173000	178000	They were hand me downs, though, from pod culture, which, you know, of course, we super appreciate that.
178000	181000	But the reality is he had already used them for some time. Then we use them.
181000	185000	We used them up. I mean, gosh, we were in the apartment when we started using those.
185000	189000	That was like five years ago. So I think those mics were just on their last legs,
189000	195000	except Techmaster Loki still has the last of those microphones because these microphones,
195000	197000	I guess these microphones are 100.
197000	199000	They were worried I'm going to break them day one.
199000	202000	These microphones are one hundred dollars a pop. So it was kind of.
202000	205000	To be honest, not a lot in the scope of mics.
205000	210000	Yeah, no, honestly, we we were looking at some, you know, pretty high end mics.
210000	213000	So but these I think are going to work for what we're going to do.
213000	217000	And it was just one of those. All right. Well, maybe we can spend two hundred dollars, but three.
217000	221000	Let's just let's hold off. So we're going to make sure these are good.
221000	225000	We don't have any problems. And then we'll upgrade. And I went lusting after other mics.
225000	232000	Yeah, you were looking at the fancy like like Lana Del Rey singing a sultry song into an old fashioned radio type of mic.
232000	236000	You're like, I want to just live stream with it. Well, that's actually kind of what I'm thinking of doing,
236000	241000	because Dan and I have been working on the live stream set up, but my office is an absolute wreck.
241000	245000	And that and I have plans to do a podcast.
245000	248000	I'll just go ahead and say that plans to do a podcast as a sister.
248000	256000	One of the sisters of perpetual indulgence to kind of expand the ministry and spread love and positivity in a very geeky, draggy kind of way.
256000	262000	Love and positivity. This is gamer culture. Fuck that bitch. Get good.
262000	267000	I'll show you good. I'll be so fucking good. I'm going to spread so much goddamn love.
267000	272000	Fuck y'all. Love everybody. Damn it. Stop being a shit.
272000	276000	That's going to be my podcast is like. All right.
276000	280000	Let's get into things that gamers need to love a little bit. Maybe. I don't know.
280000	284000	I want to start this week's show with our kickoff topic before we get into our gaming weeks.
284000	290000	Always like to bring up one topic to kind of start us off tonight. And this is one I think a lot of people are talking about this week.
290000	296000	Right. So the Sonic the Hedgehog movie trailer came out this week and it was everything we would hope that it would have been.
296000	302000	It got a reaction. Well, I don't know. Loki like you didn't seem so bothered by it.
302000	307000	Tell it. Oh, it was good. I knew it was going to be terrible. Yeah. And so all I cared about was Jim Carrey.
307000	313000	Jim Carrey was awesome. I'm sold. I'll see it even if it's garbage.
313000	320000	OK. For those that don't know, Loki's name does not come from Loki Marvel or like some of the other uses.
320000	325000	It comes from Loki mask like the mask with Jim Carrey, which is is that still like your all time favorite movie, you'd say?
325000	332000	Oh, no. I thought it was like one of your. I mean, it's cool. I like the movie, but it's it's old.
332000	339000	But so, yeah. Well, and now when I watched the Sonic movie trailer, you know, I was kind of like, all right, this just looks like it's for kids.
339000	347000	You know, whatever. Like and I think a really good comparison was made on Twitter for me that like especially when it comes to.
347000	351000	I think the big thing y'all know we're going to talk about is the look of Sonic the Hedgehog. Right.
351000	359000	So I'm not everybody took too well to the look. But, you know, I think the first thing I said on Twitter was, well, you know what?
359000	365000	It doesn't mean this movie is going to tank just because all the video gamers that grew up with Sonic are on Twitter going, what the hell did they do to Sonic?
365000	370000	Because I'm like, you know what? Like movies that we don't always understand why they're successful do very well.
370000	375000	And I was like, they've made how many movies out of those minions, which I think those things are. I don't get it.
375000	377000	I haven't seen a single one and they annoy me.
377000	383000	Granted, yes, the minions are annoying, but the like the actual story in the writing is actually pretty decent.
383000	388000	Like if you just have to like, I don't know, it's all about the 60s, the set pieces.
388000	400000	Well, in a response I got and I think this is from Flocko, I think. Sorry if I'm misappropriating that comment, but I think the reply I got and I thought this was a better comparison is he said he brought up the Smurfs and the Alvin and the Chipmunk movies.
400000	410000	And I was like, oh yeah, those Alvin and Chipmunks look terrible, but like they've made three of those movies, at least two, because one of them opened up against like a Marvel movie or something.
410000	420000	Right. But they'll keep making them because it's just like, you know, they're probably cheap to produce and they make money.
420000	425000	It's just like why there's really bad action movies out there too, because they're cheap to produce and they make money.
425000	435000	But that doesn't mean you have to make it terribly. And I understand that like, just because we don't like the look of Sonic doesn't mean that, well, it's okay, we're not the target demographic.
435000	443000	No, that would be the argument that the story that they are laying out here is kind of dumb and doesn't follow the game.
443000	449000	That would be that kind of argument, but the fact that it looks weird is a problem.
450000	459000	But it could be the fact that like, okay, if all these people that had a say on the creative direction of Sonic, if all these people were saying, this may not be a good idea.
459000	466000	Does that leave concerns about maybe the script isn't a good idea? I don't know. I mean, we're all, a lot of us are making snap decisions based on the trailer.
466000	473000	You know, we don't know what the movie story or anything's going to be. And I guess when I watched the trailer, I was like, oh, they're making another Jim Carrey movie from the 1990s.
474000	476000	And I'm down to bet.
476000	481000	Actually, that's kind of awesome. I'm all for Jim Carrey having a 90s movie.
481000	493000	I'm fine with it being a terrible movie, though. And let's be honest, there are some movies that have really good comedians in it, but they are probably pretty terrible.
493000	501000	There was one, I don't even remember, I think there was another one with Jim Carrey, actually, with penguins or something like that, that there was something to that effect.
501000	506000	I don't think I've seen that one. And then there was one I know, the Smurfs movies actually have Neil Patrick Harris.
506000	511000	I'm like, I almost want to see it just because of that, but I never did see those.
511000	520000	Looking in chat, DJ Rama S says, this movie may not be targeted at us, but for God's sake, Sonic should look damn near like his anime and gaming counterpart.
520000	524000	Why not, though? Why not try to make it appeal to as many people as possible?
524000	531000	That's just an excuse of saying, well, I'm sorry, we just didn't try that hard because we're only aiming at kids and kids don't give a shit.
531000	538000	That's a terrible argument. That's just like, well, we wanted to pay the right, you know, that'd be like, imagine a Mario movie.
538000	550000	OK, well, we can imagine a Mario movie that came out. Let's imagine a Mario movie outside of the 90s that came out where they're just like, eh, we don't fucking care because it's for kids, you know, and they just half-assed it.
550000	555000	I will say this. There was a Super Mario Brothers anime that came out that was so freaking weird.
555000	561000	Dan and I sat and watched it and it's like, why does this it had like nothing to do with any of the current canon.
561000	570000	It was also weird, like having to rescue Peach's like boyfriend or something and weirdness. But weird Mario has been done before.
570000	573000	And there is a Mario movie coming out, a new one.
573000	575000	Yeah, by Illumination.
575000	578000	Honestly, by the Despicable Me people.
578000	583000	I got to seriously, I know if they have Charles Martinet, you need to seriously sit down and watch those movies.
583000	588000	They're not that bad. They're actually pretty entertaining to watch.
588000	598000	So like I have no problem with them doing a Mario movie. I think they'd be a great studio to do Mario movie because like anything Illumination has done has actually been pretty good.
598000	605000	Even like a dog's was a life of pets or something like that. That's actually a pretty decent movie.
605000	616000	Well, let me bring it back because I think many of you, I'm sure many of you that bother to watch a Twitch gaming show probably keep some sort of pulse on the gaming news and so forth that's going out there on Twitter and so forth.
616000	629000	So I think you all know kind of the punch line that ends this is that because of all of that kind of negative reception that ended up happening on social media, on Twitter and Facebook and everything and just the memes, the redoing of Sonic and so forth.
629000	638000	The director of the movie, Jeff Fowler, who is foul town on Twitter. I actually think that's kind of a funny Twitter handle handle foul town over on Twitter said thank you for the sport and the criticism.
638000	648000	The message is loud and clear. You aren't happy with the design and you want changes. It's going to happen. Everyone at Paramount and Sega are fully committed to making this character the best he can be.
648000	660000	Hashtag Sonic movie, hashtag gotta fix fast, which I thought was funny. Now, I do want to say every other article you've seen about they have to go back and redo this before the release date.
660000	667000	They have so much they're doing that. This is this this tweet, this 280 character tweet is what's been said on the subject.
667000	674000	Every other story, every other click article you saw on Facebook, every other thing you read about how they have to go back and fix the Sonic movie.
674000	682000	I'm using my little quotey fingers. Every single one of those articles is based on this 200 character tweet. So I mean we can sit here and read between the lines too.
682000	692000	But we don't know yet if this means release date pushback. We're assuming no. We don't know if this means ironically following up on crunch time after last week's show.
692000	696000	If this means it's going to be crunch time for animators and so forth. I hope not.
696000	705000	It's probably it would be crunch time for rendering is what I would think. But they've they can still film their principal photography stuff and then add it in later.
705000	708000	Principal photography has been done since like the end of 2008.
708000	713000	So they're not 2008. I'm sorry 2018. I'm sorry.
713000	718000	That's why we're getting 90s Jim Carrey. They filmed it in the 90s.
718000	722000	They actually filmed it in the 90s. It's authentic.
722000	729000	You know what I meant. I'm sorry. We couldn't we couldn't we couldn't realize Sonic until the technology was there.
729000	737000	They filmed it last year and he made dinosaurs come to life with Sonic the Hedgehog was an additional challenge. Fuck off.
737000	743000	All right. You all know what I meant anyway. So I mean the thing is principal photography is done.
743000	748000	James Marsden. Jim Carrey. They've all moved on to other things. I don't know what they've moved on to these other things.
749000	752000	So I don't think I mean it is customary to maybe do reshoots here and there.
752000	758000	But at the same time if they're if they're fixing this rendering character that was not part of the principal photography now anyway.
758000	763000	I mean it doesn't seem like they need to actually do reshoots but I'm not a Hollywood magician.
763000	769000	Like who who likes. I want to know who okayed this. Who said. Yeah that's good.
769000	775000	I mean like who. No one's like that doesn't really look like it should.
776000	783000	Something's wrong. Focus groups focus groups. I know you're going to you're going to look at me and make fun of me because I'm saying that.
783000	789000	No I understand. I'm just answering the question that's presented. Who told them they could do that. Focus groups did.
789000	799000	I'm not saying these focus groups knew dick about Sonic the Hedgehog or anything but to be fair in Hollywood they're not necessarily wanting to just attract gamers.
799000	806000	They want to build something that they can get all sorts of families on and that they can sell toys at the end of the day.
806000	814000	But it isn't even about selling video games about selling toys. But why would making Sonic look more like the character from the game detract from Sonic.
814000	822000	That's why I don't understand like why making it look accurate would detract from people wanting to see the movie.
822000	829000	I don't ever. That's never been. Sorry. This was better. So that's why it did work. Like it doesn't make any sense. Here's the thing.
829000	839000	Like I'm not I'm not going to like disagree that he looks bad. He didn't. He doesn't look great but I'm not sure what fixing him at this point is going to do like if the movie is bad.
839000	847000	You guys it's going to be bad no matter what I want it to be if it's going to be bad. I want it to be really bad because I think Sonic as it is now.
847000	855000	I think if we just kept everything as it is now with the potential to be like so bad it's good type category like I kind of want to go there.
855000	865000	But now it's going to be like better and stuff and I guess that's fine. But Tiger Claw on chat says actually an article on I.G.M. back in December.
865000	872000	The producer Tim Miller did say that Sega was not happy with the eyes but they went with what we saw because they didn't want Sonic to look like a Pixar character.
872000	877000	Bobby Blackwell fired up in our chat saying the focus groups probably weren't given the game as a reference.
877000	884000	Yeah I also would like to know why. Why was it such a big deal that oh damn we don't want our animation to look like this really.
884000	890000	Well you know this highly esteemed animation company. God forbid we make it look good.
890000	898000	I think there's a fear looking forward that then all the reviews would say that it's a Pixar knockoff or something which I'm not.
898000	906000	Again Loki I'm just answering the I put out there I'm not saying I necessarily agree with these things but I that's probably why they did that.
906000	912000	And but I think we all sit here and know but everybody knows Sonic the Hedgehog goes back before.
912000	916000	Was Pixar a thing in ninety one. What was the first Toy Story movie. Ninety four.
916000	923000	So some predates. We'll say Pixar's legacy. If nothing else we know that Sonic predates.
923000	934000	It just sounds like it. It sounds like they just happened. I don't know. Here's the other some I am sure someone worked really hard on it but.
934000	940000	Yeah. Here's other kind of just interesting things I want to put out there about this whole debacle.
940000	946000	One of them is the fact that you know whether the news be good or whether the news be bad.
947000	951000	I am hearing more about this movie than any other movie that's coming out.
951000	957000	Oh that's because Detective Pikachu comes out this week and I'm sure it'll be just all how amazing that is.
957000	964000	Somebody was trying to tell me like what movies were opening the same weekend as Sonic and they were like oh there's a sequel to The Shining coming out.
964000	967000	There's some new Emmerich movie and I'm like I'm like they're making.
967000	970000	Why. Who's first. Who's making a sequel to The Shining and why.
970000	979000	The second like I'm just like I I'm not hearing about any of these other movies and I know you know but not nothing that's being said is any good.
979000	987000	Since when was bad publicity. Now I roll it a roll in Emmerich Sonic movie I'm down at that.
987000	993000	I was going to say a roll in Emmerich movie. I'm like you want to talk about a movie we know is going to be bad.
993000	1000000	Come on. Roll in Emmerich movies are like Independence Day. The day after tomorrow when they're running from temperature is that.
1000000	1004000	Independence Day was good. Everything after Independence Day was bad.
1004000	1011000	Independence Day is a perfect example a perfect example of a movie that's bad to the level that it's good.
1011000	1017000	Yes yes there was a lot of like hold your disbelief type things like yes that's.
1017000	1022000	Hold on to your butts. No wait that was the Jurassic Park but another movie that's kind of it's kind of bad but it's good.
1022000	1032000	Oh no it's gone. Yeah Jurassic Park has gone that way too. But yeah I mean I remember I didn't watch the last one that he did but I watched 2012.
1032000	1038000	And like there's only so many times that a plane can take off from a runway when the earthquake is destroying the road.
1038000	1042000	It happened three fucking times in the movie three times.
1042000	1048000	I kind of agree. Whereas I'm I'm appreciative of this director seems to be wanting to listen to the feedback and all that stuff.
1048000	1053000	I kind of want to see what the Emmerich Sonic movie would look like.
1053000	1057000	A character that can literally outrun temperature I think would be pretty amazing. All right.
1057000	1063000	But anyway let's talk about that fan backlash a little bit because I'm also trying to sit here and think of a time.
1063000	1075000	And I'm sure maybe chatters know because I can't think of any a time that a trailer was so poorly received that they went back and are changing the movie because of it.
1076000	1079000	This is kind of a big deal.
1079000	1086000	I'm not sure about a trailer but I know like several movies had like major reshoots like and never ended up working out too well either.
1086000	1091000	Like what of the Wolverine movie. The original Wolverine movie.
1091000	1094000	Good old test audiences seeing the original ending of things.
1095000	1097000	Little Shepherd Horrors.
1097000	1103000	Because they had the original Plants When ending with the don't feed the plants that was in the stage play.
1103000	1108000	And they went back and it tested so poorly that they went back and did a happy ending.
1108000	1114000	But it's interesting that this is something that has become more and more prevalent in gamer culture.
1114000	1118000	Like I know we're spending a lot of time talking about a movie that just happens to be based on a game.
1118000	1124000	But let's be real. Fan backlashes. This is like the new norm in gaming culture.
1124000	1127000	And I'm not completely sure how I feel about it.
1127000	1132000	Obviously the most well known circumstance of this would be Mass Effect 3's original ending.
1132000	1135000	And Jamie I know that's a game near and dear to your heart as well.
1135000	1137000	I liked the new endings.
1137000	1143000	It's interesting because there's a part of me that's like let the art just be the art and let it be.
1143000	1148000	And when I saw the original endings, because I did beat the game originally before the extended endings.
1148000	1150000	I was like it's not that bad.
1150000	1158000	I understand why people were irritated because they felt that the decisions they made were not really reflected in the ending.
1158000	1163000	But at the time I was kind of sitting there going well I feel like there's only so much you could do with it.
1163000	1166000	So like you can't wrap up every single story.
1166000	1168000	Like there's just so many branching paths at this point.
1168000	1175000	Like I don't know how else you would wrap it up besides an ending that spoiler alert for a video game that's very old at this point.
1175000	1181000	Either destroys the entire universe or synthesizes or you know the various endings at the end of Mass Effect 3.
1181000	1187000	So it's interesting they went back and did it but I'm kind of with you Jamie.
1187000	1193000	After seeing what they did with those remade endings I was like oh well I like what they did with that.
1193000	1195000	I think these are even more impactful now.
1195000	1204000	I know a lot of the hardcore fans hate the synthesis ending because of the unwillingness of merging the technology.
1204000	1209000	However, you can hate that ending all you want. I would still argue it's very well done.
1209000	1213000	Like just with Trisha Helfer's narration is amazing in that ending.
1213000	1216000	I thought it was well done. It's just not the choice that I make.
1216000	1219000	Sure, sure. You're allowed to have your head canon. That's part of the fun of Mass Effect, right?
1220000	1225000	Honestly, the only one I choose is the one that has a chance of having my femme shut back.
1225000	1231000	Yeah. So anyway, but I remember at the time that that all happened I was like, you know.
1231000	1237000	The creators of Final Fantasy 7 should be so happy that the internet did not exist.
1237000	1241000	I mean the internet was there but it was very dial up and prodigy AOL.
1241000	1245000	It wasn't as prevalent in your pocket on your mobile phone as it is today.
1245000	1252000	Like the creators of Final Fantasy 7 should be so happy that people were not able to make a fuss like they were back then.
1252000	1256000	Which has me so curious how they're going to do this remake.
1256000	1262000	Because I don't know if you guys all remember but the ending to Final Fantasy 7 is not great.
1262000	1269000	Like it's not great. Especially considering all the effort you put into that game and everything.
1269000	1275000	Like the ending, the payoff. I mean the story in that game doesn't make the most sense as it is.
1275000	1278000	And the ending just kind of like further complicates that. You know what I mean?
1278000	1279000	Yeah.
1279000	1281000	So it's going to be interesting to see how that all plays out.
1281000	1284000	Do you think there will be a DLC remake or something? I don't know. A DLC ending?
1284000	1287000	Anyway, going to chat for some more comments.
1287000	1291000	Kaijuto says, like I said, gamers don't know what they want.
1291000	1296000	They have to stop bending to everything gamers complain about and just think outside the box and create.
1296000	1301000	SSJ100Matt talking about reshoots saying Back to the Future had to reshoot most of the movie.
1301000	1303000	Because of Jason Bateman, wasn't it?
1303000	1306000	It wasn't Jason Bateman. It was somebody else.
1306000	1309000	I thought it was Jason Bateman.
1309000	1312000	No, but it was someone along those lines. Like one of those.
1312000	1314000	Yeah, it was another 80's teen guy.
1314000	1317000	But yeah, the original audiences didn't respond well.
1317000	1322000	I thought they replaced him. I didn't think they shot the whole movie.
1322000	1326000	They'd done some significant shooting but they hadn't shot the whole movie.
1326000	1327000	Which movie?
1327000	1328000	Back to the Future.
1328000	1329000	Eric Stoltz.
1329000	1330000	That's it.
1330000	1331000	It was Eric Stoltz.
1331000	1332000	Yes, that was it. Eric Stoltz.
1332000	1337000	Because I kept seeing the movie he was in with Cher in my head and I was like, I know who it is, I know who it is.
1337000	1340000	And Bobby clarifies it was two weeks, not the whole movie.
1340000	1342000	But still a pretty significant amount of time.
1342000	1349000	Very infamously, Star Trek Voyager shot without Catherine Janeway.
1349000	1355000	Without Kate Mulgrew. Well actually the character's original name I think was Nicole.
1355000	1361000	I think even the captain had a different name. I think it was Nicole Janeway and it was that French actress Genevieve Bejold.
1361000	1367000	And you can see some of her scenes on the Blu-ray because I've seen it and she's not great.
1367000	1369000	Like you could kind of tell she didn't really want to be there.
1369000	1373000	So I mean it kind of worked out because Kate Mulgrew is like legendary in that role.
1373000	1376000	But that's a little different because audiences I don't think had as much to do with that.
1376000	1383000	As maybe this is a circumstance where Hollywood and producers and things like that kind of sat in the boardroom and looked at it and made the right call.
1383000	1386000	Like when they looked at that footage they said she is not right for this part.
1386000	1390000	And got the person that they had second in mind, Columbo's wife.
1390000	1393000	Which ended up being an epic Star Trek captain.
1393000	1400000	So some other just quick reshoot things you may or may not have known about.
1400000	1405000	Bobby Blackwell pointing out the Matrix Reloaded had to reshoot after Alia died.
1405000	1412000	That's right. Alia was the role that was played by what's his name's daughter ended up doing it.
1412000	1416000	I thought it was Jada Smith.
1416000	1420000	No it wasn't that role. It was somebody famous' daughter that ended up doing it.
1420000	1425000	You know the Matrix better. Who was Alia originally supposed to play in the Matrix Reloaded?
1425000	1428000	It was not Jada Pinkett's character. It was somebody else.
1428000	1430000	Was it Trinity?
1430000	1431000	No it wasn't Trinity.
1431000	1432000	No?
1432000	1434000	Specifically in Reloaded. But anyway.
1434000	1436000	I don't remember.
1436000	1444000	No. Queen of the Damned was actually released. Z. That was Z. Z was the character in the movie.
1444000	1446000	Yeah I don't remember.
1446000	1452000	The interesting thing about Jada Pinkett's role is that she was the star of the game.
1452000	1455000	And they kind of incorporated that into the movie.
1455000	1458000	Right? Because the game had Jada Pinkett and that other character.
1458000	1463000	No it wasn't her. It wasn't her as the main character in the game.
1463000	1465000	I thought she was like the main character in the game.
1465000	1468000	No it was. I remember. Maybe it was.
1468000	1471000	That's it. Nona Gaye. It was Marvin Gaye's daughter. Or granddaughter maybe.
1471000	1473000	So anyway.
1473000	1475000	I'm trying to remember who the characters were that were in the game.
1475000	1478000	Thank you Bobby for getting the Wikipedia article faster than I could.
1478000	1480000	I don't remember. I played a lot of it though.
1480000	1485000	Let's see. There was another good reshoot comment here.
1485000	1492000	So Bobby also pointing out about reshoots after the trailer. World War Z had some reshoots after the trailer.
1492000	1497000	S.J. 100 Matt saying didn't Passion of the Christ get toned down after the fact?
1497000	1501000	Oh it was Niobe. I forgot that she was one of the main characters in that.
1501000	1505000	So with the Passion of the Christ that was an interesting one too.
1505000	1510000	Because that movie was very violent. But it was very religious.
1510000	1512000	It was very anti-Semitic.
1512000	1516000	Well I'm going to keep it to just the information.
1516000	1518000	The trailer is full of spoilers.
1518000	1520000	Anyway.
1520000	1522000	Sorry the book was better.
1522000	1530000	Here's the thing is that they because of the fact that there was many religious people interested in seeing the movie.
1530000	1534000	Who had concerns about the violence. They released a PG-13 version of the movie.
1535000	1537000	Which is not the first time they've done that.
1537000	1542000	Sometimes our movies get a PG-13 version exactly for that reason.
1542000	1545000	To try to expand who can kind of go see it.
1545000	1551000	Wasn't the original cut of Deadpool supposed to be raunchier?
1551000	1558000	Deadpool 2 had that holiday version that was PG-13.
1558000	1560000	So that's the most recent example of that.
1560000	1565000	I want to say that Aliens had to be toned down a bit too.
1565000	1569000	Or how about this for Kill Bill volume 1.
1569000	1575000	In Japan the big fight scene in the House of Blue Leaves was in color and longer.
1575000	1580000	And they made it black and white for the US one even though it's like piles of fake blood.
1580000	1584000	But for some censorship thing to lower the rating.
1584000	1587000	I have the DVD of the Japanese one.
1587000	1590000	And honestly the fight's a lot better in color.
1590000	1594000	I think the anime sequence was altered somehow too.
1594000	1597000	I don't remember it being. I'd have to watch the two of them again.
1597000	1601000	I don't even think it was in the Japanese version. I think it was something Tarantino commented on.
1601000	1606000	I'm irritated. He's kind of come out and said he's not going to end up doing a volume 3 or 4.
1606000	1608000	Which is sad.
1608000	1610000	Anyway, we got off track a little bit.
1610000	1613000	Because I really wanted to talk about fan backlashes.
1613000	1616000	But let me ask this question. Let me wrap on this question then we'll move on to our gaming weeks.
1616000	1619000	Because I know we've talked about this for a little bit. Kind of going down memory lane a little bit.
1619000	1627000	Do you think this fan backlash to Sonic is a good trend or a bad trend?
1627000	1629000	Because I want to watch how I'm wording this.
1629000	1633000	Because I don't want you guys to answer the question about what it means for Sonic.
1633000	1644000	I want you guys to answer the question. Is it a good precedent that Hollywood is now willing to change somebody's artistic vision based on the feedback?
1644000	1650000	It's ultimately up to whoever is making the content to make that decision whether they want to change it or not.
1650000	1653000	I don't think it's a bad trend that people are letting them know what their opinions are.
1653000	1656000	That's why we have social media. They want to act on it. They can act on it.
1656000	1658000	That's independent from the people criticizing it.
1658000	1665000	I don't think under any... we should not expect them to change it just because we complain about it.
1665000	1668000	But that they're going to do it. That's cool.
1668000	1672000	I mean that's in their best interest because that's going to get more people interested in it.
1672000	1676000	But that's ultimately their call and I don't think they should blame the backlash on it.
1676000	1683000	Maybe consider when you're putting out the trailer, make sure that you're showing your best work.
1683000	1689000	And to be fair, that's not to say that this isn't their fault that they're not showing their best work.
1689000	1698000	But there's been several times where I think Sony Pictures or maybe Universal or something sends out trailers without music in them sometimes.
1698000	1705000	They fuck up in that sense where like, dude, I can't believe you did that once and then I can't believe you did that a second time.
1708000	1714000	But yeah, I mean you're marketing a product. You've got to make sure that if something looks weird, people are going to call you out on it.
1714000	1719000	I'm going to comments from chat. Bobby Black Wolf, bad trend. I said the same thing about Mass Effect 3's ending.
1719000	1724000	Kajudo, bad trend. 100%. Bonds 006. I don't want the retooling. I don't want it to be a trend.
1724000	1730000	Tiger Claw says, they're not going to completely change Sonic. Mark my word. They have a plan B.
1730000	1735000	Believe it or not, you guys, mark the date and time. I kind of agree with Tiger Claw here.
1735000	1741000	No tea, no shade. But here's the thing. I don't know so much about the plan B.
1741000	1746000	I don't think they already have rendered footage that exists of something else. They probably have concept art, sure.
1746000	1750000	They have a lot of concepts. But here's the thing. I think the part of his comment where he says,
1751000	1756000	they're not going to change it as much as y'all think they are. I agree with that 100%.
1756000	1760000	I don't think it's going to be this drastic retooling of Sonic. Maybe they'll take his teeth out.
1760000	1768000	One thing to consider is that the animation has been done. All they have to do is reskin the frame.
1768000	1776000	That's all they have to do. You know, maybe tweak animation like on the eyes or something if they do give them the more,
1776000	1786000	you know, game style visage, you know. But the animation is done. The frames are done.
1786000	1792000	There's not going to be a whole lot of tweaking people have to do other than a reskin pretty much.
1792000	1799000	So it's not going to be that thing. But the other thing too is that however it's going to take,
1799000	1803000	they shouldn't rush it. They really need to take their time and do it right.
1803000	1810000	I do agree with that. I think I'm kind of like have these with you because I think when it comes to like maybe the clips of him running
1810000	1814000	or the clips of like I don't think those are necessarily going to need to be changed a lot.
1814000	1821000	But I think because of that, there's a certain structure to Sonic that is just going to have to stay the same.
1821000	1826000	Like maybe they can change some of the stuff when he's there talking and they're doing some close up shots and things like that.
1826000	1832000	But I just think there's like because I don't think they're gonna have time to go back and do all the, you know, chase sequences or whatever.
1832000	1836000	I think there's a certain frame of his they're going to have to stick with. It's too far gone.
1836000	1844000	They need to make it worse. I want to make him even taller. His legs even like wider or skinnier or whatever.
1844000	1848000	Just make it worse. I want it to be worse.
1848000	1851000	As you know, under Matt says it's a new Coke scheme.
1851000	1855000	Tweak it a little bit and come off like they care about the original subject matter.
1855000	1859000	Now here's the question. Will the Blu ray have the original Sonic scenes?
1859000	1862000	I want to be able to flip between the two.
1862000	1865000	All right. Look, I've spent enough time talking about that movie.
1865000	1871000	Like I said, I can't think of any other movie now that Avengers is coming on and Captain Marvel's coming on.
1871000	1875000	I can't think of any other movie this year that's getting as much talk right now.
1875000	1878000	So there's that even Detective Pikachu. Now, don't get me wrong.
1878000	1882000	There's a lot of talk about that. And it sounds like it's going to be great.
1882000	1885000	Some of the early reviews are saying it doesn't suck.
1885000	1890000	Like I'm not seeing five stars, but I'm seeing as far as video game movies go.
1890000	1894000	Not bad. I'm seeing it on Saturday. I want to see it too.
1894000	1899000	For sure. I definitely want to see Detective Pikachu, but I'll probably go see the Sonic movie too.
1899000	1902000	I'm seeing that for sure. Absolutely.
1902000	1907000	Honestly, I just want to see the Jim Carrey 90s stuff. And oh, it's about Sonic the Hedgehog.
1907000	1913000	I fully, I fully support that movie. And if you don't believe me, go look at my Twitter.
1914000	1918000	All right. Anyway, moving on.
1918000	1922000	Let's get into our gaming weeks and the types of games we have been playing this week.
1922000	1926000	Maybe, maybe somebody has been playing Sonic the Hedgehog in memory. I don't know.
1926000	1929000	Dark Saga, we'll start with you. How was your gaming week?
1929000	1932000	It was uneventful. I've had a very, very busy week.
1932000	1938000	I'm playing lots of Animal Crossing. I got the DJ KK booth and that makes me really happy.
1938000	1944000	I'm still playing Idle Poring. I kind of don't know if I want to keep playing it.
1944000	1950000	Just because, I don't know, I'm not getting any further in the game and I'm just kind of bored with it.
1950000	1954000	Right now I'm playing it out of this weird sense of obligation.
1954000	1962000	I've been playing Ingress a little bit. Just trying to gather equipment for the event.
1962000	1975000	We got, I don't know if I said it last week, I don't know if we had it by then, but we have a Doctor Who pinball now.
1975000	1977000	You did mention it last week.
1977000	1983000	And on camera, if you look in a minute, I'm going to put up one of the plastics that Dan gave me of a Dalek.
1983000	1987000	It's a broken one, but it hangs out in my purse now so I can put it in my cube at work.
1987000	1993000	But I've been playing actually quite a bit more of that because it has one of the best multi-balls ever.
1993000	2001000	But, I mean, really not a whole lot. It's been kind of a work week for me so it's been mostly doing web design stuff.
2001000	2002000	That's it.
2002000	2005000	Fair enough. Loki, how about you? How was your gaming week?
2005000	2009000	I didn't play a lot of games this week. I played mainly just Pokemon Go.
2009000	2013000	I've been really bad. I've not played my DDR cabinet in a while.
2013000	2022000	I'm hoping to change that this week. I've been busy with work stuff, so I've actually been doing work at home on top of work at work.
2022000	2024000	So, yeah. That's my excuse.
2024000	2032000	This week, though, my wife has gone the entire week on business and stuff, so that means I can stream video games!
2032000	2038000	And so I have to figure out what I'm going to do, but maybe we'll do some of that this week.
2038000	2047000	And then I did work on my game a bit more as well, making very small progress on that.
2047000	2059000	And then I also, because I've been waiting to get something for my PC for a while now, so I finally decided to purchase an Oculus Rift desk.
2059000	2062000	So I have that pre-ordered now.
2062000	2069000	So you got in on that, because I heard that Bobby went into a little more depth on his show tonight about that.
2069000	2073000	Which is funny, because I think we had so many news stories to talk about. I don't think I actually put it on our show roll.
2073000	2081000	We can talk about it now. That was announced and sold out like that. And you're one of them.
2081000	2086000	Yeah, I didn't realize that they sold out. I just know that they're shipping by the end of the month, is what it says.
2086000	2092000	And that's fine, whatever. I wanted it just because I didn't want to have like...
2092000	2096000	I was going back and forth between that and the Vive, what I wanted.
2096000	2104000	I stuck with the S just because it has that inside-out tracking, so I don't need to set up all the base stations for that.
2104000	2110000	It's just headset and two controllers, and then that's it. That's all you really need to get going.
2111000	2117000	I like how they have it where you can kind of define your room area a little bit, plus they have the pass-through camera on there.
2117000	2128000	So you can see if your kids come up and start asking you questions, you can flip it over and actually see them through the camera, which is kind of cool.
2128000	2139000	So I'm looking forward to that. I know that people have been harping on it because they dropped down the frame rate from 90 hertz to 80 hertz.
2139000	2147000	From what I hear from early reviews, it could be seen two ways. One, it's not a big deal, or two, oh my god, it's a terrible big deal.
2147000	2156000	You should get the $1,000 headset that has 120 hertz. You know what, I'm not spending $1,000 on a goddamn VR headset.
2156000	2162000	I'll spend the same amount of money that I was going to spend on an actual Oculus Rift and get the better Oculus Rift.
2163000	2173000	And I'm just fine with that because I don't know if this laptop can push the 120 hertz in the higher resolution without melting itself.
2173000	2184000	So I'll be fine with just that. Besides, I'm not going to exactly use it for anything super important other than playing Moshpit Simulator and really dumb VR shit.
2184000	2188000	So that's all I'm looking forward to.
2188000	2190000	Bring it to the show because I want to check that out.
2190000	2191000	Definitely.
2191000	2197000	I mean, I'm fortunate enough where I'm sure Bobby will bring the latest and greatest VR to Dragon Con, but I still want to see it when he gets it.
2197000	2209000	Yeah, I mean, and I would be down if I had like a dedicated space to do gaming, I would be down with something more elaborate where I actually have to set up those base stations and stuff, but I don't have that kind of space.
2209000	2222000	So I'm fine with, you know, something where I can go out into the living room, draw my little box that I'm going to play in and just play without having to, you know, set up a bunch of stuff and mount stuff to the wall and that kind of crap.
2222000	2225000	So I'm looking forward to that coming in at some point.
2225000	2228000	And yeah, I don't know.
2228000	2229000	All right, cool.
2229000	2230000	So that's it.
2230000	2231000	All right, the mic gaming week.
2231000	2232000	I'll start with VR.
2232000	2233000	I'll piggyback off you guys.
2234000	2237000	So VR, I've been playing a lot of Beat Saber still on PlayStation 4.
2237000	2241000	PlayStation is the only VR I have right now, but it suits my needs for what I want to play.
2241000	2243000	So Beat Saber is great.
2243000	2245000	I find that it's just really good exercise.
2245000	2252000	So like on days where I haven't really been able to get to the gym just because, like, especially Sundays are bad because we went to brunch earlier and I have to prep for OLR.
2252000	2254000	And the gym is like 20 minutes away.
2254000	2258000	So it's like I, you know, I kind of have to, you know, stay here.
2258000	2262000	So Beat Saber is great for just kind of like getting moving and burning some calories and all that.
2262000	2263000	And I just love that game.
2263000	2265000	Do they have like a calorie tracker type thing in there?
2265000	2266000	I have my watch.
2266000	2267000	My watch does all that stuff.
2267000	2268000	So yeah.
2268000	2269000	So I can just feel it.
2269000	2273000	You know, you can just kind of feel it, how worn out you are after playing because I play a lot of stuff on that hard.
2273000	2278000	I've been kind of toning back on expert a little bit just because I keep failing on expert.
2278000	2284000	So I'm like, all right, let me go through and like do everything on hard, you know, and get some trophies that way, which I've been getting more trophies on PS4 and stuff.
2284000	2287000	And then I'll go back and do the expert because, you know, again, PlayStation 4 is not modded.
2287000	2294000	So I only have like the official sanctioned songs, but with that official pack, there's that additional monster cat.
2294000	2299000	Sorry, I forget the name of the label, but they have that, that DLC pack that was like 10 more songs.
2299000	2300000	So they're monster cat.
2300000	2301000	Yeah, there is that.
2301000	2305000	And I think there's a second pack of those that's supposed to be coming at some point.
2305000	2312000	So yeah, I have enough to play in that game and I've been having a good time and then piggybacking on something that Jamie talked about.
2312000	2317000	I also have been playing a little bit of Ingress and Pokemon Go for the two of you out there to play Ingress.
2317000	2324000	I'm trying to get back to level 12 post recursion before the anomaly in Chicago because I got that event in three weeks.
2324000	2331000	I did play a little bit of Ingress too, but it was because my son does the programming class at this place, Code Ninjas.
2331000	2337000	And they're like, so do you know how we would submit to become a Poke stop?
2337000	2338000	I'm like, well, you got to do it through Ingress.
2338000	2341000	So I submitted their location as an Ingress portal.
2341000	2343000	So I was like, why not?
2343000	2349000	You know, I mean, I've seen the, you know, the rabbit over at the gymnastics place to be a Poke stop.
2349000	2355000	So I'm like, or, you know, Ingress portal poke sound like, well, if that can be one, then I don't see why this couldn't be one.
2355000	2356000	It's a place of education.
2356000	2357000	Yeah.
2357000	2359000	So, yeah, no, it would meet the criteria.
2359000	2368000	You just have to hope it's, you know, not in a area where the other players are going to be like, I don't want that team to have a part of them because I shouldn't really just do what I do.
2368000	2370000	And if it doesn't make it through the first time, just keep submitting it.
2370000	2371000	It'll go through eventually.
2371000	2374000	It's ridiculous, but it works.
2374000	2375000	Let's see.
2375000	2377000	Anyway, what else?
2377000	2379000	I've been playing Pokemon Go as well.
2379000	2382000	I haven't done the new raid yet, though, which I think is coming up later in the show.
2382000	2385000	So I probably shouldn't spoil it too much, but I have not done the new raid yet.
2385000	2387000	I need to do that.
2387000	2396000	And then as far as like other stuff, been playing some Final Fantasy 14 and continuing to try to get the max level gear.
2396000	2400000	I even did a stream this week on my personal stream, which I haven't done in a long time.
2400000	2401000	So I did that.
2401000	2403000	And still playing a little Borderlands here and there.
2403000	2408000	So I'm keeping myself pretty busy, but haven't really explored a lot of new games for me right now.
2408000	2411000	Just kind of relying on my old favorites for the moment.
2411000	2412000	All right.
2412000	2414000	Well, we're going to move on.
2414000	2423000	Speaking of not being here and events and things like that, I just want to remind you guys we will not be here in three weeks.
2423000	2425000	That's Memorial Day weekend.
2425000	2428000	We're going to have a show live, but I hope you guys will have a fun weekend.
2428000	2431000	I'm not sure if Bobby's here that weekend or not.
2431000	2432000	I'll have to see you in chat.
2432000	2435000	But I am going to be off in Chicago.
2435000	2436000	I'm doing an Ingress thing there.
2436000	2441000	And I have a lot of friends in Chicago, so it's kind of like, you know, the Ingress thing is a convenient excuse to do while I'm there.
2441000	2443000	You said Memorial Day weekend?
2443000	2444000	Yes, Memorial Day weekend.
2444000	2445000	Okay.
2445000	2448000	And then Dark Sakura is at DragCon, which...
2448000	2454000	And God, it's going to be busy because not only am I going to DragCon, I'm going to San Diego the day after.
2455000	2457000	To see a couple.
2457000	2462000	If I had time for it, I'd go even further south and see Agdeft, but I don't have a passport either.
2462000	2464000	Oh, yeah, you kind of need one of those.
2464000	2469000	But I'm going to San Diego for one day and then Tuesday I'm going to Disneyland.
2469000	2477000	I'm probably not going to do the Harry Potter thing unless I hate myself and want to drive back on Friday and go to work Saturday.
2477000	2480000	Yeah, I would be full of self-hatred.
2480000	2481000	That'd be a lot.
2481000	2483000	I'm planning, as it is, I'm driving back up by myself.
2483000	2485000	That sounds like it's going to be an action-packed trip, so that'll be fun.
2485000	2489000	It is. It'll be a lot of fun, but I'm going to be way exhausted. I was super exhausted after Easter.
2489000	2490000	Yeah.
2490000	2501000	But I will see so many sisters and drag queens, and if you are in that area and want to have lunch or something, we'll go to Roscoe's.
2501000	2503000	Hit me up on Twitter.
2503000	2504000	Yeah.
2504000	2508000	I suppose the same could be said for Chicago, but I don't know if I'll do any arcade-y things while I'm there.
2508000	2509000	Spring me back chocolate.
2509000	2512000	Yeah, I might get out to replay or something again.
2512000	2516000	I can get those bars now, by the way, but those bonbons, holy shit.
2516000	2517000	Right.
2517000	2520000	Let's get into some gaming news and talk about what's been going on.
2520000	2524000	In the world of gaming this week, there's still a lot of news to cover.
2524000	2525000	Loki, why don't you start us off?
2525000	2526000	Yeah, so this is kind of cool.
2526000	2540000	There was this game, A Dark Room, that basically is this text-based role-playing game, and the guy that made it, Amir Rajan,
2540000	2553000	he put that, well, the game was released a couple weeks ago, put that if you connect a USB keyboard to it and hit the title key, it'll actually open up a code editor.
2553000	2554000	You mean the tilde?
2554000	2555000	Tilde, yeah.
2555000	2558000	It's a title, like it's a music streaming service.
2558000	2559000	Sorry, yeah, tilde.
2559000	2560000	Yes.
2561000	2579000	It'll actually open up a Ruby programming language interpreter and code editor that he put in the hit in the game, which the whole point was, he basically put it that he liked coding and he wanted to create games.
2579000	2591000	Back in the 90s, it was difficult to do that, but now, being that it's more modern, it's easier for people to get into that, and he wanted kids to kind of get into that as well and tinker around.
2591000	2602000	Of course, Nintendo did not agree with that, and they decided to pull the game off the shop because, you know, code editor, running your own code, oh my god, hacks!
2602000	2608000	So that's unfortunate for him that you're not going to be able to do that.
2608000	2611000	I don't think they released a physical version of this, but...
2611000	2616000	I don't think they did, and the bummer is, this is such a huge infraction.
2616000	2619000	It's probably going to make him persona non grata with Nintendo.
2619000	2622000	I don't know if he's going to be able to get his game back or any other game.
2622000	2629000	That's a pretty big deal, but help me understand, the coding that you could do, could you really mess with your Switch with it?
2629000	2630000	I don't think so.
2630000	2634000	I think it's just kind of like a basic editor type thing, but I don't know.
2634000	2636000	Someone's going to find a way around it.
2636000	2642000	Mario Maker is kind of coding. My thing is, you can make games in other games.
2642000	2650000	I guess my brain goes to a little big planet, but I guess there's nothing on the Switch that allows you to freely type things.
2650000	2654000	Maybe they're worried that the door is left open too much on that.
2654000	2663000	Yeah, he said basically, the code editors, all it can do is draw lines, squares, labels, play sounds from the game, and detect button presses.
2663000	2666000	It says you can't even render an image with the damn thing.
2666000	2675000	Yes, if your app is composed completely of labels, squares, and lines, it lets you build an app without having to perform any hacks.
2675000	2678000	Are you able to draw a penis out of dashes and lines?
2678000	2679000	Yes.
2679000	2685000	Well, that's Nintendo's problem. We cannot have ASCII penis on our system.
2685000	2687000	That is foreboding.
2687000	2688000	There it is.
2688000	2692000	Heaven forbid some of those stages in Super Smash, let me tell you.
2692000	2698000	But heaven forbid somebody be allowed to program their own wiener.
2698000	2706000	But yeah, basically the problem is that he cheated their approval process, and so that's why they didn't like that.
2706000	2708000	That's unfortunate.
2708000	2712000	Yeah, I mean, you have to disclose everything that's in there.
2712000	2723000	And that's really the biggest infraction because, for example, this has actually happened to Elder Scrolls Oblivion.
2723000	2728000	They submitted their game for a rating, and you have to disclose everything that's in the game, and they got their rating.
2728000	2738000	But then come to find out, the PC version could be hacked so that you could find OMG, a bear titty on the actual CD.
2738000	2748000	The actual texture was a bear titty, and because they didn't disclose that, when they went for their rating, the game got an adults-only rating.
2748000	2751000	Was it titty, or was it the Southern Hemisphere? Was that the problem?
2751000	2752000	Which game?
2752000	2757000	Elder Scrolls Oblivion. Remember how it got re-rated, AO, because of textures that were found on the original CD?
2757000	2764000	Okay, fuck it. Grand Theft Auto, Hot Coffee mod. There's another great example.
2764000	2771000	Hot Coffee was not accessible without some type of game genie-esque sort of code or altercation.
2771000	2777000	But because Hot Coffee existed on that disc, it got Grand Theft Auto that AO rating.
2777000	2779000	Y'all know that one. That was a big deal.
2779000	2786000	Well, if you're wanting the mess of that Ruby interpreter, he does have it available to mess around with for free.
2786000	2790000	So go to dragonruby.itch.io and you can check it out.
2790000	2799000	Interesting that in spite of all that, he's still kind of like putting it out there for free. That seems bold, we'll say.
2799000	2803000	That seems like what Weird Al did with your Pitiful song.
2803000	2809000	I'm sorry, the toolkit's actually 40 bucks, but you can actually purchase it if you want to.
2809000	2812000	That was the Gaga thing too, wasn't it?
2812000	2821000	No, he didn't do that. One of Gaga's representatives said that she wanted to hear the whole song first.
2821000	2829000	And then she's like, no, I'm fine with it, you can do it. It was the recording company for James Blunt.
2830000	2834000	Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Whatever happened to him, by the way. Yeah, right?
2834000	2835000	Still can't sing.
2835000	2844000	So, anyway. Oh, Bobby's got a whole article on the Wikipedias about this. Here's the Oblivion thing.
2844000	2849000	So Bobby copied Pasta in chat. What Bethesda had originally disclosed to us is an example.
2849000	2855000	In that section of the game, there's a hanging corpse. What they disclosed to us was a hanging corpse in the dark, pretty far away and without much detail.
2855000	2861000	And yet when you bring a torch up to the hanging corpse in the actual game, you can see that it's very mutilated with lots of blood and bones.
2861000	2866000	That was a very different depiction, far more intense, far more extreme than what had been disclosed to us.
2866000	2875000	So, I mean, the disclosure is important. So whether Nintendo is afraid of ASCII dicks in this editor or not, whatever that issue is,
2875000	2884000	the problem really is that this is a pretty full-fledged feature that he put in this game and intentionally made it difficult to access that people wouldn't find it.
2884000	2893000	And then was like, you know, it was a problem. He didn't disclose it. And if he had disclosed it, maybe Nintendo could have reviewed it and seen it's not that big a deal.
2893000	2898000	You can't run homebrew on it and maybe would have let it stay. Who knows?
2898000	2903000	So, I kind of doubt they would have let it stay. But we like to think that way, right?
2903000	2907000	We like to think Nintendo is going to be a little more proactive like that. Who knows?
2907000	2914000	Anyway, let's move on. And let's talk about Platinum Games. Y'all like Platinum Games, right?
2914000	2919000	Platinum Games is set to start self-publishing.
2919000	2924000	Platinum is going to be self-publishing their games such as...
2924000	2932000	Well, we don't know exactly what games yet, but we know some examples of games that were kind of one and done were things like The Wonderful 101 and Vanquish.
2932000	2937000	And because Platinum doesn't really publish these themselves, they can't really control if a sequel is going to happen or not.
2937000	2942000	And I'm sure most people, when they think of Platinum and sequels and that whole thing, they think about Bayonetta.
2942000	2951000	And so there was an interview recently with Video Games Chronicle where Atsushi Inaba, who's the head of Platinum, said that they want to self-publish their games.
2951000	2956000	Because quote, what it means is we have a lot of different choices in the way that we want to make games.
2956000	2962000	It's that simple. And quite frankly, in the case of Bayonetta, it took a lot of time and energy to get it to the point where sequels could be made.
2962000	2966000	It wasn't as simple as picking up the phone and asking, hey, can we do this?
2966000	2970000	There were lots of pieces that needed to fall into place and a lot of negotiating that had to occur.
2970000	2977000	It's absolutely the truth that there are cases where you want to do a sequel, but if you don't own the IP, you can't do it.
2977000	2984000	Platinum also has two unannounced games in development, so we don't know if there's any possible sequels are there.
2984000	2987000	Well, I guess not because the IP, they can't bring back something wonderful 101.
2987000	2992000	So there are going to be new IPs most likely and things that are owned by the studio.
2992000	2993000	Marvelous 102.
2993000	2999000	They're saying we're in the middle of designing, the continued quote here from the studio head,
2999000	3002000	we're in the middle of designing something that has never been done before.
3002000	3007000	I know a lot of people say that, but the game we're working on is truly unlike anything else.
3007000	3010000	This is something that has never been designed before.
3010000	3014000	So from a game design perspective, we're very excited right now.
3014000	3017000	Big words about the whole never seen this before.
3017000	3019000	It'll be interesting to see if it's really true.
3019000	3023000	I would also like to know if they were able to do something with Scalebound.
3023000	3028000	Did they maybe change things around in the game so it doesn't look like the project that Microsoft funded
3028000	3031000	and maybe that's something they're going to put out after all?
3031000	3032000	Who knows?
3032000	3033000	Who knows?
3033000	3038000	You see, this game that we've never attempted before, it's like Bayonetta.
3038000	3046000	But instead of putting guns on our hands and on our feet, this dude is going to have a gun out of his ass.
3048000	3050000	Why not? Why not? Let's do it.
3050000	3053000	We're going to call it Wrecked Gun.
3056000	3058000	Oh my god, I'm so glad you're not a game designer.
3059000	3060000	Oh darn.
3064000	3066000	Bayonetta 3 is still a thing.
3066000	3070000	Hey, remember? Bayonetta 3 got announced a couple years ago.
3070000	3072000	And that was the last we heard. Yes!
3072000	3076000	Yeah, remember? Hello? Remember? Bayonetta 3 is the thing that's happening.
3076000	3077000	And that's all we know.
3078000	3080000	It was a very quick announcement trailer.
3080000	3081000	I'm hoping...
3081000	3086000	Well, you can't announce things like four years, like several years ago and then just like all of a sudden...
3086000	3087000	Yeah, you can.
3087000	3088000	I guess you can.
3088000	3090000	Everybody does it, I guess.
3090000	3092000	E3 is what? Like the week?
3093000	3095000	Here's the thing. So we're gone Memorial Day weekend.
3095000	3102000	I think that week we get back is the night that Bethesda interrupts our show with their press conference because E3 is like underway.
3102000	3105000	So, I mean, E3 is just around the corner.
3105000	3107000	So I'm super curious if Bayonetta 3...
3107000	3108000	I should just stay in LA.
3108000	3110000	...isn't going to show up. I know, right? You should just go to E3.
3110000	3111000	No, I can't.
3111000	3112000	I know.
3112000	3115000	I'm sorry, but I would rather be at work than go to E3.
3117000	3120000	E3 is work in some ways, depending on who you're representing.
3120000	3125000	No, I'm going to be around so many people for a convention I'm actually interested in, so...
3127000	3128000	I'll let...
3128000	3130000	There's a little salt around here when it comes to E3.
3130000	3133000	No, let them jerk each other off. I don't care.
3134000	3141000	Let them show their game dicks and let everyone else compare them.
3141000	3145000	I'll just wait for it to come out from the comfort of my own home.
3146000	3148000	They don't give out good swag anymore.
3148000	3151000	Let them put that on the poster for E3. Let them jerk each other off.
3153000	3156000	That's not on the approved Microsoft list, unfortunately.
3157000	3161000	As long as they've got some good dick jiggle physics. I mean, that's really all people want.
3161000	3164000	Listing! Get sexual threat.
3166000	3168000	Can you save that for later in the show? Excuse me.
3168000	3169000	Oh, no, we gotta...
3169000	3171000	Are you all paying attention? We have a list.
3171000	3174000	Everything is very... It's up on the screen, even though I haven't been totally right with it.
3174000	3177000	It's a list, and I don't see... Do you see the Microsoft thing up there yet?
3177000	3179000	That's me flipping off the list. Sorry, Lucky.
3180000	3181000	You better get to the next item on the list.
3181000	3182000	I'm very delicate.
3182000	3184000	The next item on the list is yours.
3184000	3185000	Yeah, whatever.
3186000	3188000	Rocket League! Who likes Rocket League in this room?
3188000	3191000	I think it's cool. I wish I had more time to play more of it.
3191000	3198000	Well, their developer, Psyonix, is, quote, joining the Epic Games family.
3198000	3201000	So Epic Games ruined something else.
3202000	3203000	Not yet.
3203000	3204000	Not yet.
3204000	3206000	They're planning to ruin it.
3206000	3209000	Well, the ruination is happening.
3209000	3213000	It's going to be closing in late May or early June.
3213000	3216000	They've released an FAQ about this.
3216000	3218000	But they wanted to...
3219000	3222000	I guess they're just acquiring it because Rocket League is good.
3222000	3226000	I mean, maybe? I don't know. They just like ruining things for people.
3226000	3228000	Yeah, Rocket League's pretty good.
3228000	3233000	It's an interesting title because Rocket League has esports, conventions.
3234000	3237000	You don't want to just poo-poo right off this game.
3237000	3240000	Rocket League has a huge following behind it.
3240000	3242000	I want to say, I hope I'm not misappropriating,
3242000	3244000	but I want to say our voiceover guy, Jason,
3244000	3248000	really is into Rocket League and goes to some of these events and things like that.
3248000	3252000	So there's definitely a culture out there that loves this game.
3252000	3257000	Well, at any rate, they want to assure people that nothing will change
3257000	3260000	about the day-to-day enjoyment of their game.
3260000	3265000	I think it's kind of interesting that that wording is used.
3265000	3268000	So basically, in the short term, they say nothing about the game will change.
3268000	3272000	But they're still going to go with its update roadmap
3272000	3276000	and to keep it going for, quote, as long as you'll have us.
3277000	3282000	Psyonix said that they will bring the game to the Epic Games Store
3282000	3287000	and that this is, of course, because the acquisition will allow them to grow the game
3287000	3289000	so they couldn't do it on their own.
3289000	3292000	So I don't know.
3292000	3295000	They said nothing's changing, but we'll see.
3295000	3298000	Here's why I think Rocket League does well
3298000	3301000	and why I actually enjoy Rocket League a lot too.
3301000	3305000	Here's why Rocket League, and it's honestly a great land for Epic,
3305000	3308000	whether you are a fan of Epic or not,
3308000	3310000	it makes sense why they want to have this game
3310000	3313000	because, as is mentioned in chat over there,
3313000	3317000	SSG100Matt says Rocket League is serious esports, and for sure.
3317000	3319000	Here's the thing about Rocket League.
3319000	3321000	It's a stupidly simple game to explain.
3321000	3323000	See this car?
3323000	3326000	Use car to push ball in goal.
3326000	3327000	Car soccer. Two words.
3327000	3329000	Yeah, car soccer. Go.
3329000	3331000	And that's Rocket League, right?
3331000	3334000	Where is Dota 2?
3334000	3336000	Let's explain Dota 2.
3336000	3338000	You ready?
3338000	3342000	So you have these lanes, and every lane has some walls and towers,
3342000	3344000	and you're trying to catch the thing at the end of the lane,
3344000	3346000	and you have these 50 different heroes,
3346000	3347000	and let me explain to you how they're all different,
3347000	3349000	and you have this little thing that you can send back to the store.
3349000	3352000	I'm sorry, that sounds really boring.
3352000	3354000	Here's the thing, and I'm not knocking Dota.
3354000	3357000	I think Dota is super fun in its own way as well,
3357000	3360000	but I think it also goes to, like,
3360000	3364000	I have a lot of friends that say they really enjoy board games,
3364000	3369000	and when I respond, I love Clue, they get pissed off.
3369000	3371000	But here's the thing.
3372000	3375000	Clue is very much a board game,
3375000	3378000	and Clue is a board game you can explain in five minutes.
3378000	3379000	Maybe ten.
3379000	3382000	Clue is a little more complicated than something like Candyland.
3382000	3386000	And everybody has their own house rules for Clue.
3386000	3390000	Like, for example, do you bring the piece to the conservatory
3390000	3392000	when you make an accusation,
3392000	3394000	or does it get to stay on the square where it's at?
3394000	3395000	Every house plays it differently.
3395000	3398000	Movie rules. You explained it all in the foyer.
3398000	3401000	So, but then, so there's that,
3401000	3404000	but then there's also Axis and Allies.
3404000	3407000	Like, that's the type of board game that if I don't know how to play that,
3407000	3409000	I'm not a fucking fan.
3409000	3411000	So anyway, my point is,
3411000	3415000	I think part of the reason why Rocket League is so loved
3415000	3418000	and so well in esports
3418000	3422000	is that it's a relatively simple concept when all is said and done.
3422000	3424000	It's a Clue. It's a monopoly.
3424000	3427000	It's a very easy concept, and that doesn't make it bad.
3427000	3431000	Those are, Scrabble is a game in every household, almost.
3431000	3435000	Okay? It's, you know, just a very easy type of game.
3435000	3437000	Bonds006 in chat says,
3437000	3440000	OMG, why I did not get into Dota.
3440000	3442000	I think going off my explanation there.
3442000	3444000	Kaijuto says,
3444000	3447000	The main reason why people love Rocket League
3447000	3449000	is because when you learn to fly and make aerials,
3449000	3452000	you feel badass. It's a feel-good game.
3452000	3454000	Bobby Blackwolf says,
3454000	3457000	Rocket League is closer to traditional sports
3457000	3460000	than something like Overwatch.
3460000	3463000	That's a good, you know, I know that might sound,
3463000	3466000	but I get it. Like, because, yeah, it's kinda soccer.
3466000	3468000	Kinda. Sorta.
3468000	3471000	And then they put new modes in the game that are like, kinda basketball.
3471000	3473000	Yeah, as 200Matt said,
3473000	3476000	I had friends play a full map game of Axis and Allies,
3476000	3478000	so I don't know why I pick on Axis and Allies.
3478000	3479000	It's a fine game.
3479000	3482000	But yeah, one of my friends in high school tried to teach me how to play that game,
3482000	3483000	and I was just like,
3483000	3485000	And by the way, did you know, like,
3485000	3487000	when I was playing Magic the Gathering,
3487000	3490000	like, for the first year I played Magic the Gathering,
3490000	3492000	my friends and I were playing it completely wrong.
3492000	3494000	Completely wrong.
3494000	3497000	Like, we didn't understand the mechanics.
3497000	3499000	And when the computer game came out
3499000	3501000	that kinda forced you to play by the officials,
3501000	3503000	I'm talking the original computer game
3503000	3506000	that came with the giant fucking Magic the Gathering card
3506000	3509000	and all that stuff, like, it's, yeah, it was very enlightening.
3509000	3512000	I had, like, one of the ginormous Lords of the Pit.
3512000	3515000	And we used to use the, what was it, the candelabra
3515000	3518000	that let you, like, shuffle any one card into your deck.
3519000	3523000	We would use that particular card to bring out the giant Lord of the Pit
3523000	3526000	that we could put all of his little pitties on it.
3526000	3528000	And then, of course, every so often we would randomly, like,
3528000	3531000	mix in a card from another game, like, we'd have Captain Picard.
3531000	3534000	And our house rule is that if Captain Picard came out,
3534000	3537000	everyone loses. Everyone else loses. It's an insta-win.
3538000	3540000	Card games. Another good example.
3540000	3542000	Card games. Very easy.
3542000	3544000	Cards Against Humanity.
3544000	3546000	You teach somebody how to play that game in two seconds, right?
3546000	3548000	Card game like, um...
3548000	3550000	Taboo is another easy one.
3550000	3552000	Taboo is pretty, I'm trying to think of a complicated card game.
3552000	3554000	I've only ever played it drunk.
3554000	3556000	What about, like, playing something like, um...
3556000	3558000	A deck-building game.
3558000	3559000	Gin.
3559000	3560000	Dominion.
3560000	3562000	Oh, Cribbage.
3562000	3563000	Cribbage.
3563000	3566000	Yeah, that's, I mean, it's not, I mean, Cribbage isn't, like, hard,
3566000	3568000	but it definitely takes, like, gets some explanation.
3568000	3570000	There's an explanation to it, for sure.
3570000	3572000	P-Nuckle. Another good example.
3572000	3574000	They're not hard games. They just take a while to explain.
3575000	3576000	Yeah.
3576000	3578000	Anyway. Let's move on. We can talk about card games all night,
3578000	3580000	but I wanna talk, speaking of esports,
3580000	3582000	there's a Scandalos going on, right?
3582000	3584000	Yeah, it's, it's not,
3584000	3586000	I mean, it's, it's not good,
3586000	3588000	but it's not as bad as
3588000	3590000	we might allude to, but...
3590000	3592000	So, basically, during this, uh,
3594000	3596000	the, I guess, uh, World Cup qualifiers
3596000	3598000	for Fortnite,
3598000	3600000	there was one of the, um,
3600000	3602000	pro players, uh,
3602000	3604000	DamienXXIFCook.
3604000	3606000	He was, uh,
3606000	3608000	accused of colluding with other players
3608000	3610000	to help him rank up.
3610000	3612000	So, basically, there's, um,
3612000	3614000	video out there of him
3614000	3616000	landing next to
3616000	3618000	a couple, uh, other players,
3618000	3620000	and, basically, the other players allowing him
3620000	3622000	to kill them to kinda help
3622000	3624000	rank up. And, of course,
3624000	3626000	that went viral, and,
3626000	3628000	um,
3628000	3630000	you know, that's not a good, good face.
3630000	3632000	But, on top of that, though,
3632000	3634000	apparently, uh,
3634000	3636000	there's been other cheaters
3636000	3638000	as well. So,
3638000	3640000	along with that, um,
3640000	3642000	Epic Games actually went and did some
3642000	3644000	investigating to see kinda
3644000	3646000	what was going on, and there's
3646000	3648000	been bans. So, 14-day
3648000	3650000	competitive bans on several
3650000	3652000	different players, um, including,
3652000	3654000	I think, they didn't name
3654000	3656000	XXIF, but I believe
3656000	3658000	that they were
3658000	3660000	included as well, and they have been stripped of
3660000	3662000	their qualifying spots.
3662000	3664000	Because of, um,
3664000	3666000	boosting other players.
3666000	3668000	The boosting thing's been a problem in Overwatch.
3668000	3670000	Yeah, so.
3670000	3672000	Boy.
3672000	3674000	You know, it's kinda hard when you have
3674000	3676000	these online games that you're trying to do qualifiers
3676000	3678000	in without, like, any really big oversight.
3678000	3680000	It's also an interesting thing that doesn't really
3680000	3682000	I'm trying to think, is there an equivalent in, like,
3682000	3684000	football, basketball,
3684000	3686000	as we know it, like, you know, traditional sports,
3686000	3688000	if you will, is there an equivalent of boosting?
3688000	3690000	I don't think there really is. No, it would be like throwing
3690000	3692000	a game, but, like,
3692000	3694000	Yeah, I guess throwing a game is very bad, but, like,
3694000	3696000	you know, if you go and
3696000	3698000	mentor a camp or something,
3698000	3700000	you're not exactly breaking the rules, you know,
3700000	3702000	or, I guess, can you wear a disguise
3702000	3704000	and go play a minor league game? I guess that
3704000	3706000	would be, like, the closest thing I can think of.
3706000	3708000	Like, you're wearing a fake mustache
3708000	3710000	and playing in a minor league game.
3710000	3712000	Yeah, that's, that's, that's a little different.
3712000	3714000	This is more of, like, I think, yeah, just,
3714000	3716000	just, like, oh, hey, you know,
3716000	3718000	we really want those kings
3718000	3720000	to make it to the playoffs, so let's just all
3720000	3722000	kind of drop the ball and let them throw in
3722000	3724000	those three-pointers, that type of thing.
3724000	3726000	Oh, kings are never gonna make the playoffs. Exactly.
3726000	3728000	That's the only way they would ever win.
3728000	3730000	But no one's ever gonna do that because
3730000	3732000	they all wanna win, and, yeah.
3732000	3734000	Alright, well, let's talk about something,
3734000	3736000	uh, highly interactive. That's right here,
3736000	3738000	Twitch, Twitch TV, where, uh, you can
3738000	3740000	interact with our show when we're live. Of course,
3740000	3742000	we love our podcast folks as well, and they,
3742000	3744000	you always can interact with us, uh, delayed
3744000	3746000	a little bit over on Twitter, twitter.com
3746000	3748000	slash o-l-r, and you can also do that, uh,
3748000	3750000	maybe through Facebook or through our email bag.
3750000	3752000	Participate at orangelandtrader.com.
3752000	3754000	But, uh, when you're broadcasting on Twitch,
3754000	3756000	you can interact in real time, and more and more
3756000	3758000	games are starting to think about how can we
3758000	3760000	kind of incorporate that into our game,
3760000	3762000	and Borderlands 3.
3762000	3764000	Which looks amazing, by the way. Yeah, they had a big
3764000	3766000	reveal this week, right? They had the gameplay reveal,
3766000	3768000	and I'm totally in day one.
3768000	3770000	That looks all sorts of awesome.
3770000	3772000	I have to admit, I did not watch the gameplay reveal
3772000	3774000	yet, because I'm still making my way through the other
3774000	3776000	ga- I mean, I know a gameplay reveal's not gonna
3776000	3778000	give anything away, but I just, you know, I'm just focused
3778000	3780000	on trying to get through the original games,
3780000	3782000	uh, before this comes out.
3782000	3784000	But, uh, yeah, I'm excited for
3784000	3786000	folks that are into this series, and now I see
3786000	3788000	why people enjoy Borderlands. I get it.
3788000	3790000	Um, anyhow, uh, so
3790000	3792000	during the, uh, Borderlands 3
3792000	3794000	reveal, they talked about an extension called
3794000	3796000	the EchoCast. So if you
3796000	3798000	use this extension, apparently,
3798000	3800000	um, you can- the viewers can
3800000	3802000	look at the streamer's loadouts,
3802000	3804000	look at what's in the backpacks.
3804000	3806000	So through the extension, I guess you could
3806000	3808000	probably click on something on the view window, and even if I'm
3808000	3810000	not looking at my inventory at this minute, you can look at
3810000	3812000	my inventory on your- your
3812000	3814000	Twitch screen, because that's how the extensions
3814000	3816000	kind of work, right? I don't know if we use any
3816000	3818000	extensions on, um, VOG Network's
3818000	3820000	channel. I don't- Bobby would have to
3820000	3822000	refresh my memory. I don't think so,
3822000	3824000	because we're not really playing games here.
3824000	3826000	Um, but a lot of the more traditional
3826000	3828000	Twitch extensions, there's things like,
3828000	3830000	um, you know, you can interact with the streamer,
3830000	3832000	maybe play noises, or, you know, sometimes you can
3832000	3834000	affect what's going on in the game. My favorites
3834000	3836000	are, like, I was watching the other- Mixer does this a lot,
3836000	3838000	too. I watched the other day, there's a guy
3838000	3840000	that, um, he has, like, a currency
3840000	3842000	that they can earn by playing different
3842000	3844000	games in chat, and then they spend that
3844000	3846000	currency on putting cheats in Grand Theft Auto,
3846000	3848000	so they can put cheats in
3848000	3850000	to hurt or, you know, help the
3850000	3852000	player, and it's all sorts of
3852000	3854000	craziness. Yeah, this, uh, Tomb Raider
3854000	3856000	reboot had something like that in, like, the
3856000	3858000	multiplayer or something, where, like, that your
3858000	3860000	Twitch chat could affect what's going on.
3860000	3862000	So, I mean, we've heard about games, you know,
3862000	3864000	kind of interacting with Twitch, but anyway, uh, also
3864000	3866000	there will be special loot chests throughout
3866000	3868000	the game. If a streamer opens them,
3868000	3870000	you can opt into a challenge called
3870000	3872000	the Rare Chest Event. This
3872000	3874000	means the viewer would get a copy
3874000	3876000	of whatever the streamer
3876000	3878000	gets. It's kind of, I like
3878000	3880000	that, that's kind of interesting. It would be a
3880000	3882000	shift code, I guess, that would be given out, and
3882000	3884000	scaled to the viewer's level when you redeem it in
3884000	3886000	your own game. So, interesting.
3886000	3888000	Um, the gameplay reveal,
3888000	3890000	I guess the EchoCast extension was, uh,
3890000	3892000	coincided with that, so if you were
3892000	3894000	watching the Borderlands 3
3894000	3896000	reveal, you kind of get an idea how that works,
3896000	3898000	which I missed out on, but, uh, did they, did they
3898000	3900000	actually have that going during the gameplay? I didn't watch
3900000	3902000	it on Twitch, so I don't know. So,
3902000	3904000	interesting, though. I think that's really cool.
3904000	3906000	Um, I like how more games are thinking about
3906000	3908000	how can we, like, really embrace this streaming
3908000	3910000	thing, and, like, do our own stuff
3910000	3912000	with it. I think that's really cool.
3912000	3914000	So, uh, yeah.
3916000	3918000	S2100Matt says, uh, this opens the door
3918000	3920000	for people to judge other people's inventory.
3920000	3922000	I tend to be a massive hoarder in games like this.
3922000	3924000	I would imagine that you could turn it off,
3924000	3926000	I suppose, if you wanted to. Maybe.
3926000	3928000	I don't know. Anyway, let's move on.
3928000	3930000	DarkSakura, what do you have for us? Well,
3930000	3932000	there is a video game hall of fame.
3932000	3934000	Of course, we know about this one, among
3934000	3936000	other ones, but we're talking about the
3936000	3938000	nice, legit one.
3938000	3940000	You know what I mean by legit, right?
3940000	3942000	Uh, meaning
3942000	3944000	non-pirated, I guess.
3944000	3946000	Well, no, meaning that it's actually
3946000	3948000	a pretty big one.
3948000	3950000	So, uh, this year,
3950000	3952000	the, um, the,
3952000	3954000	uh, it's the Strong's
3954000	3956000	World Video Game Hall of Fame.
3956000	3958000	So, uh,
3958000	3960000	the, uh, games that are being included
3960000	3962000	are, duh duh duh,
3962000	3964000	uh, Mortal Kombat,
3964000	3966000	which, it's got a deserving
3966000	3968000	place. Um, Super Mario Kart,
3968000	3970000	uh, also,
3970000	3972000	um, Colossal
3972000	3974000	Cave Adventure, and get this,
3974000	3976000	Windows Solitaire.
3976000	3978000	Then again, I get that.
3978000	3980000	How much of us wasted so much time
3980000	3982000	on that? Seriously? Windows Solitaire
3982000	3984000	was a game for filthy casuals.
3984000	3986000	Um, filthy casuals, really?
3986000	3988000	Even, you know what I mean. Yeah.
3988000	3990000	It's a joke. But, and all
3990000	3992000	joking aside, um, Solitaire, and I
3992000	3994000	feel like this just came up on the show a few weeks ago,
3994000	3996000	Solitaire's a great game for developing motor skills.
3996000	3998000	Like, if you are, you know, maybe
3998000	4000000	older and haven't used computers an awful lot,
4000000	4002000	Solitaire is a great way to learn.
4002000	4004000	I reckon. It's just,
4004000	4006000	it's never... I've used that in my professional life.
4006000	4008000	That's all why I kind of bring that up.
4008000	4010000	Somebody who's a little less comfortable with computers, I'll say,
4010000	4012000	have you played Solitaire at home? You should think about it.
4012000	4014000	Okay. Well, it does
4014000	4016000	get you kind of into the point and click
4016000	4018000	mentality. Yes. You know, which I guess
4018000	4020000	for people doing, like, data entry
4020000	4022000	or something, that might be
4022000	4024000	worthwhile. But I just think it's very
4024000	4026000	interesting that it's finally being
4026000	4028000	recognized. That instead of just
4028000	4030000	being, you know, bloating software
4030000	4032000	for Microsoft Windows,
4032000	4034000	it's a mainstay. On top
4034000	4036000	of that, with this picture, it's got, like, the same
4036000	4038000	monitor that Dan and I had when I first moved in
4038000	4040000	with him. This little dinky
4040000	4042000	computer monitor. That's pretty funny.
4042000	4044000	Um, you know, but the
4044000	4046000	other thing about Colossal Adventure is that,
4046000	4048000	you know, Colossal Cave Adventure, sorry,
4048000	4050000	is that it was also a cassette
4050000	4052000	game. So, you know,
4052000	4054000	but the other games that were,
4054000	4056000	uh... Sorry,
4056000	4058000	the Colossal Cave Adventure, that's a text adventure game, right?
4058000	4060000	Yeah. That predates Zork.
4060000	4062000	So it's kind of like your text adventure
4062000	4064000	representation, right? Yeah, it's like
4064000	4066000	your intro to all things text.
4066000	4068000	Can you read? You can play it. I think that was
4068000	4070000	one of the first, yeah. And I think that's why it's
4070000	4072000	noteworthy. But the other thing is
4072000	4074000	that there were some other games that were in the
4074000	4076000	list of finalists, but did not
4076000	4078000	make it, including, those were
4078000	4080000	Candy Crush Saga,
4080000	4082000	Centipede,
4082000	4084000	DDR, Half-Life,
4084000	4086000	Myst, NBA 2K, Sid Meier
4086000	4088000	Civilization, and Super Smash Brothers
4088000	4090000	Melee. Here's the thing. Shouldn't a game
4090000	4092000	have to be out for at least 10 years
4092000	4094000	before we start thinking about the Video Game
4094000	4096000	Hall of Fame? Like, when it comes to Candy Crush.
4096000	4098000	Because I would say a game like Mortal Combat,
4098000	4100000	I think if we had evaluated
4100000	4102000	whether it belonged in a Video Game Hall of Fame
4102000	4104000	in 1995, or whatever year that game came
4104000	4106000	out, or even one or two years after it was out,
4106000	4108000	I'm not so sure we would think that
4108000	4110000	that game is going to end up in the Hall of Fame someday.
4110000	4112000	Because of how controversial it was. What are my
4112000	4114000	rules for classic game?
4114000	4116000	Yes. But you're not
4116000	4118000	curating this museum, unfortunately.
4118000	4120000	I'll curate a museum. And it's basically
4120000	4122000	going to be Mass Effect
4122000	4124000	and Sega games.
4124000	4126000	Which, if you go to the classic
4126000	4128000	game of the week list, is similar to what
4128000	4130000	she did. No, I have Compile
4130000	4132000	because of Guardian Legend.
4132000	4134000	Okay, sorry. One exception.
4134000	4136000	Bitch, don't doubt me.
4136000	4138000	Hearts. But anyhow,
4138000	4140000	that's cool. And I see in our chat,
4140000	4142000	SD100Matt says, I keep meaning to go to this place.
4142000	4144000	My girlfriend has family in Rochester
4144000	4146000	and we're up there often. Hey, if you go,
4146000	4148000	take video. Take a ton of it.
4148000	4150000	Bring us a souvenir.
4150000	4152000	I'd be curious. Anyway.
4152000	4154000	And then ship me some Waffle House Grits.
4154000	4156000	Metal Mayhem in chat says, didn't cassette
4156000	4158000	games have horrendous accessing and low
4158000	4160000	times? Oh, absolutely.
4160000	4162000	Absolutely, they did. Well, on top of that,
4162000	4164000	I'm sure I've spoken ad nauseam about the problems
4164000	4166000	with the Coleco Atom. That anytime you
4166000	4168000	had a power surge, it would erase your cassettes.
4168000	4170000	Right. But the thing about it,
4170000	4172000	I mean, the cassette was what existed
4172000	4174000	before the disc, which existed
4174000	4176000	before the CD, which is ironic. The audio
4176000	4178000	is also used, kind of, two of those
4178000	4180000	forms. To be fair,
4180000	4182000	there were 11 inch floppies
4182000	4184000	and 13 inch floppies
4184000	4186000	around the same time that cassette
4186000	4188000	became a viable
4188000	4190000	storage media.
4190000	4192000	And I think cassette was just
4192000	4194000	you know, like, again, there was
4194000	4196000	no way to, like, have
4196000	4198000	a pre-installed game
4198000	4200000	that you could put on your system
4200000	4202000	or what have you without, like, typing
4202000	4204000	it in if it weren't for cassette or disc.
4204000	4206000	Yeah. You either programmed
4206000	4208000	that shit in BASIC or
4208000	4210000	you, I mean, well,
4210000	4212000	in computers for production
4212000	4214000	at the time, we're still, some of them
4214000	4216000	were actually still using Fortran and punch cards.
4216000	4218000	So, there you go.
4218000	4220000	Yeah. So,
4220000	4222000	it is kind of interesting, though, how tapes kind of went to CD
4222000	4224000	later on, but anyway. So,
4224000	4226000	okay, there you go. Additions to the Video Game Hall of Fame.
4226000	4228000	It's a decent selection.
4228000	4230000	I mean, when you hear some of the games, they omit it.
4230000	4232000	Of course, my fanboy is going, what?
4232000	4234000	No Civilization? They couldn't, Mortal
4234000	4236000	Combat couldn't wait another year for Civilization? I knew that would make you
4236000	4238000	sad. I know, a little bit, but
4238000	4240000	I can't, like, look at any of those games
4240000	4242000	they picked and say it doesn't deserve it.
4242000	4244000	Yeah, they all deserve
4244000	4246000	their place in there. They all deserve it in their own way.
4246000	4248000	Like, even if you kind of look at Solitaire
4248000	4250000	and go, huh? Like, again, you have to look
4250000	4252000	at, what did it do for gaming the big
4252000	4254000	picture as opposed to just gaming for the
4254000	4256000	hardcore audience? Seriously, that is exactly
4256000	4258000	it. I mean, although, I
4258000	4260000	must say, the thing that disappoints me
4260000	4262000	is that DDR isn't included.
4262000	4264000	Sure. Because DDR, for
4264000	4266000	itself, was actually fairly revolutionary
4266000	4268000	for genres. Well, it created
4268000	4270000	a genre, practically. Well, Beatmania
4270000	4272000	really did. DDR is why we're
4272000	4274000	here.
4274000	4276000	If it were me, I would put Beatmania in before
4276000	4278000	DDR, because we wouldn't have DDR without
4278000	4280000	Beatmania.
4280000	4282000	Or Spiderstomp. Here's the thing, though. Here's what's
4282000	4284000	ultimately going to happen, because this is based in
4284000	4286000	America, and it's a Murica
4286000	4288000	thing. I think DDR
4288000	4290000	was more known here than Beatmania.
4290000	4292000	Which, to be fair, is Konami's own damn
4292000	4294000	fault, because they released it here as Hip-Hop
4294000	4296000	Mania, and it wasn't really the same kind of thing.
4296000	4298000	And they did that, I think, after DDR.
4298000	4300000	Yeah, and they never tried
4300000	4302000	the five key releases here and that stuff
4302000	4304000	until way later.
4304000	4306000	So, I mean, DDR is what
4306000	4308000	people know here. My first exposure was
4308000	4310000	BM98. Sure,
4310000	4312000	but you also go
4312000	4314000	to anime conventions,
4314000	4316000	which is not, you know... Well, at the time, I did.
4316000	4318000	At the time.
4318000	4320000	Alright, well, let's move on, and
4320000	4322000	let's get to our next story,
4322000	4324000	which is from Loki.
4324000	4326000	Alright, so this has
4326000	4328000	got me very excited, even though we know
4328000	4330000	no details about this yet, and
4330000	4332000	there's a good chance that they're going to fuck it up.
4332000	4334000	But you're still going to pre-order your ticket.
4334000	4336000	Oh, yeah, seriously.
4336000	4338000	So Saints Row the Movie is something that's going to be
4338000	4340000	worked on, and apparently
4340000	4342000	right now, they've
4342000	4344000	got a director attached,
4344000	4346000	director F. Gary Gray,
4346000	4348000	who is, I guess, working
4348000	4350000	on, or he had worked on The Fate of the Furious
4350000	4352000	and the upcoming Men in Black
4352000	4354000	International. And then, of course,
4354000	4356000	Greg Russo is going to be
4356000	4358000	writing
4358000	4360000	the treatment as well, and he's
4360000	4362000	rebooting the Mortal Kombat franchise
4362000	4364000	in the movie forms.
4364000	4366000	And, yeah, so that's
4366000	4368000	about all we know about it right now. I'm assuming
4368000	4370000	this is something that's going to be
4370000	4372000	coming way later on.
4372000	4374000	They've got to have Daniel
4374000	4376000	Dae Kim as Gat, because that's really the only
4376000	4378000	way I'd want to see that.
4378000	4380000	And what
4380000	4382000	the hell? Let's just put Troy Baker in there
4382000	4384000	as well as the
4384000	4386000	boss, because that'd be awesome.
4386000	4388000	What do you want to see in a Saints Row movie?
4388000	4390000	I want to see fucking crazy shit, but being that it's
4390000	4392000	The Fate of the Furious, that movie is pretty
4392000	4394000	over the top as it was.
4394000	4396000	So let's just, like,
4396000	4398000	take that. Let's take the
4398000	4400000	new Fast and the Furious
4400000	4402000	spin-off movie that they have coming out pretty soon.
4402000	4404000	Take all of that stuff
4404000	4406000	and just say,
4406000	4408000	tell the director,
4408000	4410000	do whatever the fuck you want.
4410000	4412000	Just go as crazy as you want
4412000	4414000	and make it... It doesn't even have to be believable.
4414000	4416000	Just go fucking nuts, and then that would
4416000	4418000	be perfect. Tigerclaw in chat asks,
4418000	4420000	will the Saints Row movie
4420000	4422000	have the self-awareness and meta-humor?
4422000	4424000	If it doesn't,
4424000	4426000	I hope they don't make it.
4426000	4428000	It needs to, like, seriously.
4428000	4430000	I don't think
4430000	4432000	they should directly adapt one of the games,
4432000	4434000	but Saints Row 3, again, I cannot
4434000	4436000	stress this enough. I was laughing
4436000	4438000	so hard during the opening moments
4438000	4440000	of Saints Row 3. Like, I was
4440000	4442000	crying. Like, it's just, like,
4442000	4444000	the game is so fucking funny.
4444000	4446000	And my character, you know,
4446000	4448000	I had, like, a female character that
4448000	4450000	was, like, falling through planes
4450000	4452000	and stuff like that. Like, the opening is just ridiculous.
4452000	4454000	And I'm just like, this game is
4454000	4456000	so, so stupid.
4456000	4458000	I love it. I love it.
4458000	4460000	Yes, I want that.
4460000	4462000	I want that, too. So stupid that
4462000	4464000	it's amazing. Make that bad
4464000	4466000	Sonic movie that Loki wants to see.
4466000	4468000	But Saints Row, put
4468000	4470000	Jim Carrey in the Saints Row movie.
4470000	4472000	Is there a part for him in there?
4472000	4474000	Not really, but, um, but yeah,
4474000	4476000	just, like, over the top. Like, there's plenty of
4476000	4478000	movies that are kind of over the top.
4478000	4480000	I mean, many in the Fast and the Furious
4480000	4482000	franchise. I mean, they're just, like, the whole
4482000	4484000	Fast and the Furious thing, which is over
4484000	4486000	the top. But that, that's
4486000	4488000	why it was good, you know?
4488000	4490000	I just don't want them to do, like, a cheap
4490000	4492000	just, like, this is gonna be kind of, like,
4492000	4494000	Fast and the Furious.
4494000	4496000	But, I don't know, like,
4496000	4498000	Gat is such a great character, it's gonna be hard to
4498000	4500000	find some, if they recast him, it's gonna be
4500000	4502000	hard to, like, get that character right.
4502000	4504000	The boss can be who, that's
4504000	4506000	gonna be the hard part, is the boss, because
4506000	4508000	who's it gonna be? Because
4508000	4510000	it can be pretty much anybody.
4510000	4512000	Um, I don't know. Metal Mayhem in
4512000	4514000	Chats is a Saints Row movie needs to have a gun,
4514000	4516000	dubstep gun and a giant purple
4516000	4518000	dildo bat. Honestly, cosigned.
4518000	4520000	Like, that might surprise you that I'm saying
4520000	4522000	that, but those are the things- And Professor
4522000	4524000	Genki. Those are the things that make Saints
4524000	4526000	Row, like, fucking stupid.
4526000	4528000	But, like, in that really funny way.
4528000	4530000	You know what I mean? And this is perfect for, like,
4530000	4532000	that really stupid action movie
4532000	4534000	genre, where it's like, you'll make it,
4534000	4536000	it'll be fucking stupid, and it'll make
4536000	4538000	tons of money, and they'll make more and more,
4538000	4540000	and it'll be, whatever.
4540000	4542000	Uh, Bonds 006
4542000	4544000	says, Saints Row film, a very bad
4544000	4546000	over-the-top Deadpool sans Ryan
4546000	4548000	Reynolds. Deadpool? Honestly, maybe
4548000	4550000	Deadpool is a good thing to
4550000	4552000	kinda look at for how to do this. Oh my god.
4552000	4554000	Yeah. I'm cosigning
4554000	4556000	Ryan Reynolds as the
4556000	4558000	boss for the Saints Row movie.
4558000	4560000	Hell yes. I don't,
4560000	4562000	the man can only do so much, but
4562000	4564000	I, that would be amazing
4564000	4566000	if he did. Wasn't Ryan Reynolds supposed to be
4566000	4568000	doing, like, the Clue movie at some point? I don't know.
4568000	4570000	He can do everything. He signed on to all those board game
4570000	4572000	movies or something? Whatever happened to that?
4572000	4574000	Development hell, I guess.
4574000	4576000	But yes, Daniel Dae Kim and Ryan
4576000	4578000	Reynolds. They're saying Keith David is the
4578000	4580000	narrator. Well, Keith, Keith
4580000	4582000	David's supposed, yeah.
4582000	4584000	He's just supposed to be Julius, so.
4584000	4586000	Uh, SD100Matt says that Hobbs and
4586000	4588000	Shaw movie looks ridiculous, I'm concerned. Exactly.
4588000	4590000	Keep that level of ridiculousness
4590000	4592000	and over-the-top, you know.
4592000	4594000	It just, just keep it going. Yeah.
4594000	4596000	Alright. Uh, anyhow,
4596000	4598000	let's move on. Uh, got another story here
4598000	4600000	before we get to our classic game of the week, and this is
4600000	4602000	about a classic game of sorts.
4602000	4604000	Earthworm Jim has a new game in
4604000	4606000	development for the new Intellivision
4606000	4608000	Amico, which, of course, as we know,
4608000	4610000	is coming out in the year 2020. I still don't like those controllers.
4610000	4612000	I get it. Like, I don't like
4612000	4614000	them. Yeah. I hope they have
4614000	4616000	traditional controllers as well. Yeah.
4616000	4618000	I'm sorry to call this out on air, but make sure when you do this, uh,
4618000	4620000	it's away from the mic, because remember the new mics are super sensitive,
4620000	4622000	so it's picking up the bags. Sorry.
4622000	4624000	And I was sitting on the mic.
4624000	4626000	Anyway, um, so, uh,
4626000	4628000	the new Intellivision, of course, is coming out, uh,
4628000	4630000	what, 10.10.2020, and, uh,
4630000	4632000	Earthworm Jim hasn't had a game
4632000	4634000	since, what, 95? So they're making
4634000	4636000	a new one. Oh, no, there was a high, uh,
4636000	4638000	there was an HD remake. They did do that.
4638000	4640000	Yeah. Yeah, but not as a
4640000	4642000	proper sequel. So, uh, the
4642000	4644000	original team members are participating
4644000	4646000	in this, uh, including Doug
4646000	4648000	to Naples, which, um,
4648000	4650000	he's a character. We'll put it that way. My
4650000	4652000	understanding is that, uh, he is
4652000	4654000	doing it on a volunteer basis, so if you're
4654000	4656000	worried about possibly
4656000	4658000	money and all that stuff, it sounds like
4658000	4660000	that is, it's gonna be a little easier to
4660000	4662000	separate the art from the artist in this, this
4662000	4664000	particular circumstance because he's volunteering,
4664000	4666000	which is kind of interesting,
4666000	4668000	um, but cool, I guess.
4668000	4670000	And, of course, Tommy Tallarico, he did the music
4670000	4672000	and the soundtrack before, uh,
4672000	4674000	so, uh, he's gonna be doing that again,
4674000	4676000	of course. And what a coinkydink
4676000	4678000	that Tommy Tallarico is playing such
4678000	4680000	a role as the CEO
4680000	4682000	of Intellivision, so it kind
4682000	4684000	of makes sense why this game is
4684000	4686000	the one that they're bringing back. Um,
4686000	4688000	I was interested, though, when
4688000	4690000	I saw a lot of the comments on this
4690000	4692000	about how, well, looks
4692000	4694000	like I'm not playing Earthworm Jim
4694000	4696000	because they're putting it on this trash console
4696000	4698000	and, well, I'm just, uh, fuck
4698000	4700000	exclusivity agreements, I'm not gonna play it.
4700000	4702000	Well, they don't know what... And I'm just kind of like,
4702000	4704000	oh, shut up. Like,
4704000	4706000	do y'all know what business is?
4706000	4708000	Because if, if the Amico wasn't
4708000	4710000	trying to get some exclusives and some games
4710000	4712000	that are, like, kind of like must-haves or must-tries,
4712000	4714000	then you all would shit on the
4714000	4716000	Amico for not having any games worth playing.
4716000	4718000	So, like, this kind of goes back
4718000	4720000	to the beginning. I just don't know about the controllers, though.
4720000	4722000	Like, I know, I don't remember,
4722000	4724000	you know, the
4724000	4726000	ColecoVision too fondly, and I know the Intellivision
4726000	4728000	stuff's kind of similar. Um,
4728000	4730000	I don't know. I just,
4730000	4732000	I have a hard time imagining how that's gonna
4732000	4734000	work, but I'm sure it'll make it work.
4734000	4736000	Bobby is pointing out you saw a render, but not
4736000	4738000	the actual controller, so. Right. There's still time
4738000	4740000	for things to change based on fan feedback.
4740000	4742000	Perhaps.
4742000	4744000	Uh, Metal Mayhem says, so long as the new
4744000	4746000	Earthworm Jim is like the first two games, not Earthworm Jim 3D,
4746000	4748000	I'll be happy. I think it's a safe
4748000	4750000	bet to say it's gonna be like the first two games that you remember.
4750000	4752000	Yeah, I think that's what they're going for in this
4752000	4754000	console. It's supposed to be all 2D stuff, isn't it?
4754000	4756000	Uh, yeah, I think so.
4756000	4758000	Uh, Dartusuya says, I know Tommy made a
4758000	4760000	comment going to bat for him, whatever it's worth,
4760000	4762000	but I do hope he does a good soundtrack for this game.
4762000	4764000	Um, and it's also interesting to point out,
4764000	4766000	you know, for, whether you
4766000	4768000	hate the exclusiveness or not,
4768000	4770000	remember Intellivision has very
4770000	4772000	firmly said games will cost
4772000	4774000	at most, what, ten bucks? I think it was actually
4774000	4776000	under that, it was like eight bucks.
4776000	4778000	So that means, I would assume
4778000	4780000	Earthworm Jim is going to be no different.
4780000	4782000	It's going to be like an eight dollar game.
4782000	4784000	So, interesting.
4784000	4786000	I, I just. Yeah, I'd be curious to see
4786000	4788000	what happens when it comes out.
4788000	4790000	You know, it's, it's interesting to see how
4790000	4792000	the Intellivision is coming into its own.
4792000	4794000	And I'll be very curious to see more
4794000	4796000	moves like this about what, what kind of
4796000	4798000	games are they really going to bring to the table
4798000	4800000	as we approach 2020 and the
4800000	4802000	release. You know, we still have over a year to go, a year
4802000	4804000	and a half to go before we get to October
4804000	4806000	of 2020. So I'll be very curious to
4806000	4808000	see what more develops in the coming months.
4808000	4810000	So.
4810000	4812000	All right. As Joe and I, Matt, points
4812000	4814000	out, the main thing is they're taking their time.
4814000	4816000	And Bobby Blackwolf pointing
4816000	4818000	out they're not targeting people who would use pro controllers,
4818000	4820000	they're targeting mobile users.
4820000	4822000	We'll see. I am,
4822000	4824000	I, I'll give it a chance. Let's, let's
4824000	4826000	a lot of this is still
4826000	4828000	hypothesis and theory. And that's,
4828000	4830000	and that's fine. I like like,
4830000	4832000	and I'm fine with the controllers
4832000	4834000	being the way they are. I just hope that they
4834000	4836000	have the forethought to like, we'll have
4836000	4838000	Bluetooth and you bring your own damn controller
4838000	4840000	if you want, you know, that, that's fine.
4840000	4842000	Um, would be nice. I'm not saying they
4842000	4844000	have to do it the way everybody
4844000	4846000	else is doing it, but I
4846000	4848000	mean, if I have my choice between,
4848000	4850000	you know, using the
4850000	4852000	type of controls I would on a mobile game
4852000	4854000	versus an actual controller, I'm
4854000	4856000	going to choose an actual controller.
4856000	4858000	We will see. There's still a long way to go.
4858000	4860000	Anyway, before we get to
4860000	4862000	the release of Earthworm Jim, we're going to take
4862000	4864000	a trip down memory lane and
4864000	4866000	visit the classic game of the week. Every
4866000	4868000	week here on the show, Dark Soccer steps into the
4868000	4870000	gaming vault and tries to find a game that she thinks,
4870000	4872000	hey, you kids, you should be checking this
4872000	4874000	one out. This is a classic, y'all.
4874000	4876000	We do talk about this one a lot. Yes.
4876000	4878000	So, uh, yeah, we have brought this game up a few
4878000	4880000	times. So, uh, and it's not a Sega game.
4880000	4882000	Nope. It is an absolute
4882000	4884000	Nintendo game. So what
4884000	4886000	is the classic game of the week? Clu Clu Land,
4886000	4888000	which came out in
4888000	4890000	1984 in Japan
4890000	4892000	and, uh,
4892000	4894000	just under a year later in the
4894000	4896000	U.S. and, uh, so in Japan it came out November
4896000	4898000	22nd, 1984, and in the
4898000	4900000	U.S. it came out October 18th, 1985,
4900000	4902000	and then, uh, in 87
4902000	4904000	in, uh, Europe.
4904000	4906000	So Clu Clu Land, first of
4906000	4908000	all, people are like, what does this have
4908000	4910000	to do with, uh, is it Clu
4910000	4912000	from Tron? What? Um, no.
4912000	4914000	It actually is
4914000	4916000	an, uh, Anglicization
4916000	4918000	of, uh, the Japanese title
4918000	4920000	Kuru Kuru, um,
4920000	4922000	you know, uh, it was Kuru Kuru Land,
4922000	4924000	which basically, Kuru Kuru is an
4924000	4926000	onomatopoeia that means around and around.
4926000	4928000	Uh, or you
4928000	4930000	might have also heard Guru Guru, you know, same
4930000	4932000	thing. Um, so basically
4932000	4934000	the main character has to grab poles
4934000	4936000	and swing around, so that's where it comes
4936000	4938000	from. It's the same, uh,
4938000	4940000	uh, kind of title for the Game Boy
4940000	4942000	romance game, uh, Kuru Kuru Kururin.
4942000	4944000	So, anyway, um,
4944000	4946000	in Clu Clu Land you play
4946000	4948000	a balloon fish named Bubbles in the U.S.
4948000	4950000	She was Gloopy in Japan, which I think
4950000	4952000	Gloopy's a funnier name. Um,
4952000	4954000	she swims around in a maze trying
4954000	4956000	to uncover these gold ingots.
4956000	4958000	Um, so
4958000	4960000	you basically,
4960000	4962000	um, are fighting
4962000	4964000	this sea urchin
4964000	4966000	called Unira, who
4966000	4968000	is stealing all of the treasures
4968000	4970000	in the underwater kingdom of Clu Clu Land.
4970000	4972000	So Bubbles has to retrieve
4972000	4974000	all the treasure and spin around and gather all
4974000	4976000	the gold ingots, um,
4976000	4978000	and...
4978000	4980000	The rupees.
4980000	4982000	They look like rupees.
4982000	4984000	Well, that's because they reuse all the
4984000	4986000	things anyway. But at any
4986000	4988000	rate, um, it is,
4988000	4990000	uh,
4990000	4992000	um, you know, she,
4992000	4994000	if she gets attacked by an Unira
4994000	4996000	then she'll lose a life. Um,
4996000	4998000	she can also, though,
4998000	5000000	uh, stun an Unira by using
5000000	5002000	a sound, uh, a sound wave.
5002000	5004000	Um,
5004000	5006000	you can also lose your life if you fall into a
5006000	5008000	black hole or when the time runs out. And
5008000	5010000	of course, you run out of all lives, it's
5010000	5012000	game over. Um,
5012000	5014000	and then sometimes you have to
5014000	5016000	pass over the ingots in an
5016000	5018000	odd number to uncover them.
5018000	5020000	And, cause they will go between
5020000	5022000	their uncovered side and
5022000	5024000	a dull side. You know, it's kind of like
5024000	5026000	how, uh, um,
5026000	5028000	Qbert goes in later levels where you have to do double jumps
5028000	5030000	on some of the items. Um,
5030000	5032000	there was, um,
5032000	5034000	other versions that came out. There was a
5034000	5036000	versus Clu Clu Land. Have you guys ever seen one?
5036000	5038000	Oh god, I
5038000	5040000	think I did once. I do
5040000	5042000	remember, like a multi-versus
5042000	5044000	machine and I think Clu Clu Land was one of them
5044000	5046000	cause I kind of made fun of it. That's how I saw
5046000	5048000	my first versus Clu Clu Land. It was
5048000	5050000	at a Godfather's Pizza in Mobile, Alabama.
5050000	5052000	Um,
5052000	5054000	so, of course, you know, released
5054000	5056000	for the coin-op Nintendo versus system.
5056000	5058000	It had twice as many
5058000	5060000	puzzles
5060000	5062000	in a new
5062000	5064000	enemy called Boss Unira.
5064000	5066000	Um, different level themes and some other
5066000	5068000	features. Um,
5068000	5070000	and a port of this one was
5070000	5072000	released as
5072000	5074000	the final game for
5074000	5076000	the Famicom Disk System
5076000	5078000	as called Clu Clu Land.
5078000	5080000	Welcome to New Clu Clu Land.
5080000	5082000	Um, the
5082000	5084000	NES version and the
5084000	5086000	Famicom Disk System version are
5086000	5088000	both unlockable in
5088000	5090000	Game, uh, in Animal
5090000	5092000	Crossing, the one on GameCube.
5092000	5094000	Um, that was retitled
5094000	5096000	as Clu Clu Land D
5096000	5098000	outside of Japan. Um,
5098000	5100000	other ports in 2001, there
5100000	5102000	was a port to the Sharp Zaris
5102000	5104000	PDA.
5104000	5106000	Um, we had, uh, in
5106000	5108000	2004, it was released
5108000	5110000	on the Famicom
5110000	5112000	Mini for Game Boy Advance.
5112000	5114000	Um, Bubbles
5114000	5116000	was also a trophy in Super Smash
5116000	5118000	Brothers Melee. And the Clu Clu
5118000	5120000	Land NES music and
5120000	5122000	the Unira enemy are
5122000	5124000	items in Super Smash Brothers Brawl.
5124000	5126000	And, of course, they
5126000	5128000	also re-return as items in
5128000	5130000	Super Smash Brothers Ultimate.
5130000	5132000	Um, she's also,
5132000	5134000	uh, in a
5134000	5136000	secret level of the
5136000	5138000	Game Boy Advance game, DK King of Swing,
5138000	5140000	which was
5140000	5142000	pretty much inspired by Clu Clu Land.
5142000	5144000	Um, there's a
5144000	5146000	microgame of Clu Clu Land in
5146000	5148000	WarioWare Smooth Moves for Wii.
5148000	5150000	And, um,
5150000	5152000	Clu Clu Land's
5152000	5154000	Nintendo microgame in Mario
5154000	5156000	Twisted. Uh, the
5156000	5158000	rupee from the Legend of Zelda series was modeled
5158000	5160000	after the Inkot sprite from
5160000	5162000	Clu Clu Land.
5162000	5164000	That money bag also looked like the money bag that was in
5164000	5166000	Legend of Zelda Link to...
5166000	5168000	or, uh, Adventures of Link.
5168000	5170000	And they also said that the Dig Dogger enemy
5170000	5172000	from, uh, Legend of Zelda
5172000	5174000	series was basically based
5174000	5176000	off of the Unira. Um,
5176000	5178000	of course, Clu Clu Land is also one of the games
5178000	5180000	included in NES remix.
5180000	5182000	And there you have it.
5182000	5184000	All right. Kuru Kuru Land.
5184000	5186000	Your classic game of the week, a game
5186000	5188000	that, uh, some of you in chat are like,
5188000	5190000	I never really understood how this game works. What is this?
5190000	5192000	What is this that's being drawn on stream right now?
5192000	5194000	Glasses. Yep.
5194000	5196000	How about that?
5196000	5198000	Cause, I mean, a lot of them just were like, you know, little
5198000	5200000	puzzles. Once you figured out
5200000	5202000	what the puzzle piece was, then
5202000	5204000	it was really easy to go in
5204000	5206000	and figure out how
5206000	5208000	to swing around them. Yeah.
5208000	5210000	It's kind of like, um, it's kind of like that game, uh,
5210000	5212000	Anticipation. Once you've played it enough,
5212000	5214000	that little pencil draws, like, two lines
5214000	5216000	and you know what the answer is.
5216000	5218000	Ain't no Anticipa-
5218000	5220000	Yeah. It makes that game a whole lot, uh,
5220000	5222000	less fun at that point. I was trying to do
5222000	5224000	a Rocky joke. I know. I know.
5224000	5226000	All right. Uh, thank you for that classic game of the week
5226000	5228000	selection. Um, speaking of classic games,
5228000	5230000	uh, we have a contribution this week
5230000	5232000	for our little, uh, break segment here we do in the
5232000	5234000	middle of the show. And it is from, uh,
5234000	5236000	our pal Bobby Blackwolf,
5236000	5238000	who went to a classic game show in Atlanta last week
5238000	5240000	and found this really cool,
5240000	5242000	uh, TI 99
5242000	5244000	4A. Y'all remember that computer?
5244000	5246000	I think I had one. I had two.
5246000	5248000	I, I didn't- I did it as a classic system
5248000	5250000	remember? You did. That's right. You did do a
5250000	5252000	classic system. Well get this. So what he's about
5252000	5254000	to show us is Dragon's
5254000	5256000	Lair, the 80s game
5256000	5258000	running on a TI 99
5258000	5260000	4A. What? And I, I don't mean
5260000	5262000	like some scaled down port
5262000	5264000	cause there was like a Commodore 64 version of Dragon's Lair
5264000	5266000	but it was completely different. How much RAM do they have to put
5266000	5268000	in this thing to make it work? Well, we're about
5268000	5270000	to find out. So why don't we turn it over to Bobby
5270000	5272000	and find out.
5272000	5274000	Hello, Orange Lounge Radio. Bobby
5274000	5276000	Blackwolf here. Uh, I know I'm
5276000	5278000	usually on a couple hours ago
5278000	5280000	but Rob really likes having
5280000	5282000	content in the middle of the show and I'm here at the Vintage
5282000	5284000	Computer Festival Southeast
5284000	5286000	7.0 in Roswell, Georgia and
5286000	5288000	uh, I saw a game that
5288000	5290000	uh, is not a classic
5290000	5292000	game of the week because it was just released
5292000	5294000	but it's for really old
5294000	5296000	systems and it's a really old game.
5296000	5298000	So I have Alan here. Alan,
5298000	5300000	what am I looking at here?
5300000	5302000	You are looking at Dragon's Lair for the
5302000	5304000	Texas Instruments TI 99
5304000	5306000	for a home computer. And this is
5306000	5308000	obviously the side-scrolling platformer
5308000	5310000	that was released on the NES, right?
5310000	5312000	Uh, I got something to do.
5312000	5314000	No, absolutely not. This is an
5314000	5316000	actual conversion. This is a
5316000	5318000	fully licensed conversion of Dragon's
5318000	5320000	Lair made by Harmless Lion
5320000	5322000	and he took the high
5322000	5324000	definition video and audio
5324000	5326000	from the PC release in
5326000	5328000	I think it was the early 2000s
5328000	5330000	digitized it with his own software including
5330000	5332000	the video and the audio and then produced
5332000	5334000	the game out of it. He took 80
5334000	5336000	megabytes of data, crammed
5336000	5338000	it into this little cartridge that gets banked
5338000	5340000	in 8K chunks
5340000	5342000	and it's
5342000	5344000	fully playable.
5344000	5346000	And I have been playing it and it's
5346000	5348000	just as unforgiving
5348000	5350000	as I remember. But you
5350000	5352000	really don't have like a laser displayer hiding
5352000	5354000	under here, right? You're not doing like video trickery?
5354000	5356000	No, no. Those are actually a little bit too expensive for my
5356000	5358000	budget. So,
5358000	5360000	how long do you, like, what's
5360000	5362000	the backstory behind this? Like, how long did it take
5362000	5364000	him to do it?
5364000	5366000	I want to say it took him at least a couple
5366000	5368000	of years to work on it but he's been actually building
5368000	5370000	the fundamentals for a couple of
5370000	5372000	decades.
5372000	5374000	If you've
5374000	5376000	been in the Atariage forums at all
5376000	5378000	in the TI sub forums of Atariage
5378000	5380000	you'll see where he's put up some
5380000	5382000	demos here and there of sampled audio,
5382000	5384000	sampled video. One of his
5384000	5386000	first ones actually was Spaceballs
5386000	5388000	that he did on a, I think it was a 4
5388000	5390000	megabyte cartridge. And
5390000	5392000	he says that this was his
5392000	5394000	target game. This was one of the games he always wanted
5394000	5396000	to do and he spent all this time
5396000	5398000	getting the process perfected
5398000	5400000	so he could produce it. So is
5400000	5402000	this an unmodified TI-99
5402000	5404000	or is this running any expansion boards that you're running it on here?
5404000	5406000	No, this is a completely stock
5406000	5408000	unexpanded TI-99 4A
5408000	5410000	console. That means there's no 32K,
5410000	5412000	it does not have the F18A
5412000	5414000	replacement
5414000	5416000	for the video processor. It's completely
5416000	5418000	stock as if you opened the box
5418000	5420000	in 1983.
5420000	5422000	So do you know, is he worried about
5422000	5424000	any takedowns like whoever owns
5424000	5426000	the Dragon's Lair IP? Because we just saw
5426000	5428000	the Super Mario Brothers Commodore 64
5428000	5430000	conversion and apparently Nintendo
5430000	5432000	sent a cease and desist once it hit the
5432000	5434000	media sites. Has he been contacted
5434000	5436000	by anybody that owns the rights or do we even know
5436000	5438000	who has the Dragon's Lair rights right now?
5438000	5440000	Well the rights to Dragon's Lair
5440000	5442000	is owned by a company called
5442000	5444000	Digital Leisure. I believe they're out of Canada
5444000	5446000	and he actually contacted them,
5446000	5448000	purchased a license and got their blessing
5448000	5450000	on this conversion
5450000	5452000	of Dragon's Lair for the TI.
5452000	5454000	That's awesome. So
5454000	5456000	I know there's a boxed copy
5456000	5458000	here and I know that you're giving it away but where can
5458000	5460000	people find it if they can't get a boxed copy?
5460000	5462000	It's actually no longer available.
5462000	5464000	He produced 155
5464000	5466000	cartridges and he was able to
5466000	5468000	ship all of his orders before the license expired
5468000	5470000	for production and at this point
5470000	5472000	there will never be another release of it.
5472000	5474000	No ROMs anywhere?
5474000	5476000	There are no ROMs anywhere and that has a lot
5476000	5478000	to do with the licensing and
5478000	5480000	plus it's just
5480000	5482000	one of those things. It just kind of
5482000	5484000	makes it a little bit more valuable
5484000	5486000	that way. So if people want to play it they need
5486000	5488000	to come to like a vintage computer festival somewhere?
5488000	5490000	At this point yes. The only way to play it is if
5490000	5492000	you know somebody who has it.
5492000	5494000	Or if you win it here which I
5494000	5496000	competed and
5496000	5498000	got third to last.
5498000	5500000	Actually I think you're fourth to last.
5500000	5502000	I'm fourth to last now.
5502000	5504000	Today right now I do have
5504000	5506000	a fully boxed copy
5506000	5508000	completely unopened
5508000	5510000	ready for the winner today
5510000	5512000	to take home with him. Right now
5512000	5514000	we have about 20 minutes left
5514000	5516000	in the contest. We do have a top score
5516000	5518000	winner by the name of JR
5518000	5520000	just walking around here having a good time
5520000	5522000	waiting to take home his copy of Dragon's Lair.
5524000	5526000	It was fun to play.
5526000	5528000	I didn't do too well.
5528000	5530000	He claimed the controller.
5530000	5532000	But then he fixed the controller and I can't play again
5532000	5534000	because I've already played.
5534000	5536000	So I can't compete again.
5536000	5538000	It runs on regular
5538000	5540000	Atari style
5540000	5542000	joystick and everything.
5542000	5544000	It is what it says it is.
5544000	5546000	It's really impressive.
5546000	5548000	I remember seeing a demo of this.
5548000	5550000	You had just gotten a demo last year.
5550000	5552000	Yes. Last year at VCF
5552000	5554000	I was able to obtain
5554000	5556000	the demo
5556000	5558000	from Mike Brent, Tursi,
5558000	5560000	Harmless Lion.
5560000	5562000	I was able to show it here
5562000	5564000	and had it playing.
5564000	5566000	It was quite amazing. A lot of people stopped by
5566000	5568000	to take a look at it and we were really
5568000	5570000	championing the bit to get the final release
5570000	5572000	and we finally got it.
5572000	5574000	The technical achievement
5574000	5576000	is absolutely amazing.
5576000	5578000	Now remember I said that this is
5578000	5580000	an unmodified TI-99-4A
5580000	5582000	but obviously an out of the
5582000	5584000	box cartridge
5585000	5587000	Is there some
5587000	5589000	hardware trickery that's going on
5589000	5591000	to actually make this work?
5591000	5593000	There is absolutely some sorcery going on in here.
5593000	5595000	Mike Brent
5595000	5597000	he knows this hardware
5597000	5599000	inside and out.
5599000	5601000	This is an absolute masterpiece.
5601000	5603000	A symphony of hardware and software.
5603000	5605000	It's more than just the program.
5605000	5607000	It took a cartridge that had not been
5607000	5609000	invented. It extends the banking
5609000	5611000	scheme of our cartridge port
5611000	5613000	beyond what has ever been used.
5613000	5615000	The cartridge actually has the ability
5615000	5617000	to hold 128 megabytes of
5617000	5619000	data banked in 8K chunks.
5619000	5621000	He has it loaded with 80 megabytes
5621000	5623000	of data right now for this game.
5623000	5625000	So Mike put
5625000	5627000	a lot of work, he's put a lot of time,
5627000	5629000	blood, sweat and tears to make what is
5629000	5631000	an absolute masterpiece.
5631000	5633000	And I guess here's the question
5633000	5635000	some people would ask
5635000	5637000	is
5637000	5639000	why
5639000	5641000	would someone go through that?
5641000	5643000	Why would someone do that?
5643000	5645000	Why not?
5645000	5647000	Because it's there.
5647000	5649000	If you have that one thing
5649000	5651000	that you really really want to do
5651000	5653000	and you get the opportunity to do it
5653000	5655000	you'd be a fool to pass it up.
5655000	5657000	Dragon's Lair
5657000	5659000	on the TI-99-4A
5659000	5661000	hardware trickery
5661000	5663000	but it's stock system
5663000	5665000	and it does exactly what it says
5665000	5667000	it does. So I'm going to send it back over to you Rob
5667000	5669000	over in the OLR studios. Maybe this will
5669000	5671000	be a classic game of the week in
5671000	5673000	10 years since it just came out
5673000	5675000	right now.
5675000	5677000	And we're looking at some footage there that
5677000	5679000	Bobby's closing the video up with. That looks
5679000	5681000	great. I mean considering the hardware
5681000	5683000	that it's on, that looks fantastic.
5683000	5685000	That's great. So thank you so much
5685000	5687000	Bobby for picking that up and checking
5687000	5689000	that out for us there. That looked
5689000	5691000	great. And I love that. I love the answer
5691000	5693000	at the end there. Why do this?
5693000	5695000	Why not?
5695000	5697000	Well, I think
5697000	5699000	that's a really good question.
5699000	5701000	I think that's a really good question.
5701000	5703000	I think that's a really good question.
5703000	5705000	Why not?
5705000	5707000	I love it. I think the moment that he said
5707000	5709000	that it was unmodified I was sort of like
5709000	5711000	holy shit.
5711000	5713000	Yeah. That's well done. Well done.
5713000	5715000	Kudos to everybody involved with that because
5715000	5717000	the person that was being interviewed there was not the creator.
5717000	5719000	Of course I'm sure you picked up there in the interview
5719000	5721000	but I was representing the game and I just
5721000	5723000	I love
5723000	5725000	people that will go to the great lengths to
5725000	5727000	kind of do those things and preserve
5727000	5729000	the classics even if it's in these very
5729000	5731000	like strange
5731000	5733000	ways. So super cool.
5733000	5735000	And what you didn't see in that video is
5735000	5737000	that Bobby actually went out to the parking lot
5737000	5739000	and keyed the car of the winner of
5739000	5741000	that Dragon's Lair cartridge.
5741000	5743000	So sorry to the oh no I'm obviously making
5743000	5745000	all that up there. But good job Bobby
5745000	5747000	not getting last last place
5747000	5749000	in that contest.
5749000	5751000	He was what? Fourth from last. What was the
5751000	5753000	contest? Playing Dragon's Lair? I think he was trying to get a high
5753000	5755000	score on that Dragon's Lair game. Yeah I would have lost that.
5755000	5757000	If you're not used to playing it.
5757000	5759000	Oh god. I did some contest a
5759000	5761000	long time ago. I think it was like Stampede on the
5761000	5763000	Atari 2600 at some. And it was like
5763000	5765000	the official Twin Galaxies
5765000	5767000	ranking or something. I was like third from last place.
5767000	5769000	So I didn't know what the hell I was doing.
5769000	5771000	But I thought it was cool because as I was doing it they were giving me
5771000	5773000	tips on how to get better at it. So
5773000	5775000	it's kind of neat.
5775000	5777000	The way you get
5777000	5779000	the highest score is you fake
5779000	5781000	your video or you
5781000	5783000	upload a fake score online and say that
5783000	5785000	the video is gone. Now Bobby
5785000	5787000	in chat says the guy who won the cartridge
5787000	5789000	actually has the arcade cabinet
5789000	5791000	so he knew everything. Well you know
5791000	5793000	what? At least you know it's going to a good home.
5793000	5795000	You know if somebody splurged the money for the
5795000	5797000	arcade cabinet you know they're a fan of Dragon's
5797000	5799000	Lair and so you know what?
5799000	5801000	It's going to go to a good home. And maybe something
5801000	5803000	you know I know we joke about
5803000	5805000	could that be a classic game here in ten years
5805000	5807000	on OLR the TI. I don't know if the
5807000	5809000	original Dragon's Lair has surely been a
5809000	5811000	classic game at some point. I don't know. I would think.
5811000	5813000	But maybe not.
5813000	5815000	Alright now do Space Ace.
5815000	5819000	You know what really impressed me?
5819000	5821000	Now you got to do Space Ace.
5821000	5823000	No. Anyway.
5823000	5825000	Thank you Bobby. Thank you for the segment
5825000	5827000	and thank you for sharing that here on Orange
5827000	5829000	Lounge Radio. Appreciate it. And if you guys have ideas for
5829000	5831000	a break segment here at Orange Lounge Radio

5845000	5847000	In the meantime let's get
5847000	5849000	to some rapid fire news and
5849000	5851000	travel. Oh thank you. Bobby says he will
5851000	5853000	upload that to YouTube if the podcast
5853000	5855000	audience wants to actually see what
5855000	5857000	that looked like because you can hear the audio there
5857000	5859000	especially at the end. You can only hear the audio and hear
5859000	5861000	how you know again for a
5861000	5863000	TI-9944A how
5863000	5865000	faithful it is. But yeah hopefully
5865000	5867000	you get to see that there. Thank you Bobby.
5867000	5869000	Alright let's get into some rapid
5869000	5871000	fire news and some quick other
5871000	5873000	news that happened around the world this week.
5873000	5875000	Yes. So let's talk a little
5875000	5877000	bit about what's coming out for
5877000	5879000	your free game. Well your
5879000	5881000	games with paid subscription
5881000	5883000	to online services.
5883000	5885000	Not really free. I can't believe it's not free.
5885000	5887000	Here's what's coming out
5887000	5889000	on Xbox and on PlayStation.
5889000	5891000	So Xbox One for May. We're
5891000	5893000	getting Marooners from
5893000	5895000	May 1st to the 31st and the Golf
5895000	5897000	Club 2019 featuring PGA
5897000	5899000	Tour from May 16th through the
5899000	5901000	15th of June.
5901000	5903000	And then
5903000	5905000	on the Xbox 360
5905000	5907000	which is also of course backwards compatible
5907000	5909000	with Xbox One.
5909000	5911000	Comic Jumper from May 16th
5911000	5913000	to the 31st and last but not least
5913000	5915000	Earth Defense Force Insect Armageddon on
5915000	5917000	May 1st through the 15th. Definitely
5917000	5919000	go check that out because it's awesome.
5919000	5921000	It's a spin off but it's fun. I'll be sure
5921000	5923000	to download that in your honor Loki since I
5923000	5925000	know you don't have an Xbox One but I do. But I
5925000	5927000	have that game on my Xbox 360
5927000	5929000	and I actually have that on PC too
5929000	5931000	so you know.
5931000	5933000	Like I would question it.
5933000	5935000	Yes.
5935000	5937000	And then of course this is pretty awesome but
5937000	5939000	so
5939000	5941000	For Honor they've got
5941000	5943000	now of course since
5943000	5945000	May the 4th was
5945000	5947000	yesterday and that's a big Star
5947000	5949000	Wars day so along with that
5949000	5951000	in For Honor you can use now
5951000	5953000	light
5953000	5955000	sabers that aren't
5955000	5957000	legally, legally not
5957000	5959000	light saber but laser
5959000	5961000	sword type weapons
5961000	5963000	can be used and
5963000	5965000	you can go check those out if you have that game.
5965000	5967000	So laser
5967000	5969000	weapons. Bright swords.
5969000	5971000	Very bright swords.
5971000	5973000	Sabers of
5973000	5975000	lasers.
5975000	5977000	That's true. I keep forgetting like yesterday was a
5977000	5979000	Star Wars holiday.
5979000	5981000	Using my quotey fingers but I guess like an actual
5981000	5983000	thing in California was here and they made some honorary
5983000	5985000	holiday you know not a real holiday but one of those
5985000	5987000	like honorary holidays was like official in
5987000	5989000	California now so it's kind of fun. Yeah.
5989000	5991000	Which by the way you know happy single
5991000	5993000	to my own I guess you know.
5993000	5995000	I actually you know what's funny. It's revenge of the 5th.
5995000	5997000	I
5997000	5999000	I went to brunch with some friends this morning
5999000	6001000	and it was you know I had to suggest the place
6001000	6003000	because they suggested the place last time. So I was
6003000	6005000	like oh let's go and I was just
6005000	6007000	last night I was like oh Alan really likes that new taco
6007000	6009000	bar place and there's a it opened up
6009000	6011000	they just opened up one up in Folsom so let's
6011000	6013000	go to the taco bar place. Not even thinking
6013000	6015000	today's Cinco de Mayo.
6015000	6017000	And I get up this morning and I go oh fuck
6017000	6019000	it's Cinco de Mayo and I just suggested we
6019000	6021000	go to the taco place. Oh yeah. Luckily
6021000	6023000	we got there early enough it wasn't
6023000	6025000	horrible but by the time we were
6025000	6027000	leaving it was like a shit show
6027000	6029000	waiting to get in. They had like the radio station out there
6029000	6031000	doing promotions and everything. I should have gotten
6031000	6033000	tacos today. It would have been probably cheaper.
6033000	6035000	Yeah right.
6035000	6037000	I forgot. Gosh.
6037000	6039000	Alright moving on. Other rapid fire news.
6039000	6041000	Let's talk about Anthem. Let's talk about
6041000	6043000	a game that's
6043000	6045000	kind of not done so
6045000	6047000	well in the fan base.
6047000	6049000	Well BioWare is reassuring
6049000	6051000	folks that Anthem is not being abandoned
6051000	6053000	even though it sure is starting to look that way
6053000	6055000	because executive
6055000	6057000	producer Mark Dara and lead producer
6057000	6059000	Michael Gamble both have started
6059000	6061000	working on other BioWare projects.
6061000	6063000	And what's interesting Mark Dara
6063000	6065000	over on Twitter at BioMarkDara
6065000	6067000	said we aren't working on Dragon
6067000	6069000	Age 3. We aren't working on Dragon
6069000	6071000	Age 5 dot dot dot
6071000	6073000	I guess that's that.
6073000	6075000	Like just fucking pointing
6075000	6077000	a laser sword right at the
6077000	6079000	fact that the team has very clearly
6079000	6081000	moved on to Dragon Age 4. Many of them.
6081000	6083000	Well right cause you know
6083000	6085000	Dragon Age 3 already came out.
6085000	6087000	Well yeah of course. It was Inquisition.
6087000	6089000	3 was Inquisition if you didn't already know.
6089000	6091000	Which was awesome.
6091000	6093000	Anyway well hopefully Dragon Age 4 is awesome
6093000	6095000	because but anyway it was very
6095000	6097000	important also because
6097000	6099000	even though some of these high profile folks have left
6099000	6101000	BioWare is reaffirming
6101000	6103000	commitment to Anthem's follow through
6103000	6105000	on some of the shortcomings that they had
6105000	6107000	earlier. So Michael
6107000	6109000	Gamble in a tweet said there's been a lot of
6109000	6111000	incorrect speculation on this.
6111000	6113000	The studio's support and commitment to
6113000	6115000	Anthem has not changed.
6115000	6117000	Quoting a tweet from Chad Robertson at BioWare
6117000	6119000	who said we remain 100% committed to Anthem
6119000	6121000	and look forward to showing players the new content
6121000	6123000	we're working on. We want to make sure we aren't
6123000	6125000	over promising so our updates on what's
6125000	6127000	coming in the game will be focused
6127000	6129000	when we have things near completion.
6129000	6131000	So my
6131000	6133000	understanding is they put out a calendar that they
6133000	6135000	haven't really been able to follow very well and just
6135000	6137000	Anthem
6137000	6139000	I just unfortunately
6139000	6141000	like everything that we just kind of feared
6141000	6143000	was going to happen with Anthem is happening
6143000	6145000	and I think that's all we really need to
6145000	6147000	say about that. Best of luck to the team and
6147000	6149000	I hope they're able to make a Diablo
6149000	6151000	3-esque situation out of this but
6151000	6153000	yeah.
6153000	6155000	Anyhow let's move on
6155000	6157000	and talk about a
6157000	6159000	Kickstarter that met its goal
6159000	6161000	this week. I think we brought this up on the show
6161000	6163000	previously. Antstream is the
6163000	6165000	Kickstarter. They met their goal.
6165000	6167000	And I should disclose I ended up backing
6167000	6169000	it. Somebody actually posted to Discord
6169000	6171000	that they met their goal and that was the reminder
6171000	6173000	to me I was like oh yeah shit I was
6173000	6175000	supposed to go donate my money so I did
6175000	6177000	and they've actually hit their first stretch
6177000	6179000	goal which is going to be prioritized
6179000	6181000	they don't want to over promise when
6181000	6183000	Playstation 4 support is coming but they're prioritizing
6183000	6185000	Playstation 4 support
6185000	6187000	so that will be something that
6187000	6189000	happens. If you are not familiar with
6189000	6191000	Antstream
6191000	6193000	it is a
6193000	6195000	kind of trying to legalize what a lot
6195000	6197000	of you are doing through ROMs
6197000	6199000	and it's going to be allowing you to play
6199000	6201000	games on the Amiga, the Commodore 64
6201000	6203000	Sega Genesis
6203000	6205000	the ZX Spectrum
6205000	6207000	because this is actually a company that's based
6207000	6209000	over in Britain
6209000	6211000	so obviously the ZX was a much
6211000	6213000	bigger deal over there and Commodore was a huge deal over there too
6213000	6215000	so they're focusing a lot on those systems
6215000	6217000	but this will be out in the US as well they are saying
6217000	6219000	and US people can back the Kickstarter which I think
6219000	6221000	has 4 or 5 more days on it
6221000	6223000	they showed some early alpha
6223000	6225000	play on a recent
6225000	6227000	charity stream overseas
6227000	6229000	and that was when I watched that
6229000	6231000	that really kind of sold me on it. They were playing Double Dragon
6231000	6233000	and they were doing like
6233000	6235000	challenges and one of the challenges
6235000	6237000	they were doing was as many headbutts
6237000	6239000	as they could in one segment of the game in 60 seconds
6239000	6241000	and I thought those challenges
6241000	6243000	were cool and something
6243000	6245000	to add to retro
6245000	6247000	that isn't already there
6247000	6249000	because again I shouldn't be
6249000	6251000	reading the comments section but my stupid
6251000	6253000	ass always inevitably does
6253000	6255000	and a lot of people taking issue with
6255000	6257000	Antstream because
6257000	6259000	the games are old
6259000	6261000	people are emulating them anyway
6261000	6263000	and you're fucking doing it illegally
6263000	6265000	like you can sugar coat it all you want
6265000	6267000	but technically you're not supposed to be
6267000	6269000	doing that. It's just that you know they have an
6269000	6271000	enforcer line. Here's the
6271000	6273000	more valid criticism of
6273000	6275000	Antstream that you know
6275000	6277000	Antstream is streaming
6277000	6279000	so you're not downloading the ROMs to your computer
6279000	6281000	or your Xbox and playing them off
6281000	6283000	that. You are streaming it like
6283000	6285000	Google Stadia but
6285000	6287000	again these games are not at 1080p
6287000	6289000	60 frames a second so I think there's a little more
6289000	6291000	allowance. I think there's a lot of web pages that are
6291000	6293000	probably larger than these games I mean
6293000	6295000	I don't think that
6295000	6297000	oh no I don't have
6297000	6299000	you know the resolution
6299000	6301000	of my gigabit
6301000	6303000	is going to be a lot lower I'm not so
6303000	6305000	worried about if it's going to kill bandwidth
6305000	6307000	or not but I do understand some people
6307000	6309000	a little more hesitant because of that but I also understand
6309000	6311000	that that is one way to make the
6311000	6313000	experience consistent between
6313000	6315000	Xbox One and mobile phones and all that stuff
6315000	6317000	so anyway you know but
6317000	6319000	take what I'm saying with a grain of salt I just told you
6319000	6321000	I backed it so you know now I guess I have
6321000	6323000	an investment in it for whatever it's worth
6323000	6325000	but I just I'm excited
6325000	6327000	to play the Commodore 64 games
6327000	6329000	in an environment that reminds me
6329000	6331000	of the old GameTap
6331000	6333000	which has a little more competition going with it
6333000	6335000	just a little more
6335000	6337000	fun in some old classic games
6337000	6339000	I wanted to mention real quick since I forgot
6339000	6341000	to mention Playstation
6341000	6343000	for the month of May we're getting
6343000	6345000	Overcooked and
6345000	6347000	Edith Finch so those are
6347000	6349000	the two games we're getting. Ooh Edith Finch
6349000	6351000	such a good game.
6351000	6353000	Yeah and Dartitsuya says Anstream
6353000	6355000	is getting the rights to host these so I don't think
6355000	6357000	there's any legality issues there. Nope
6357000	6359000	and you know what they said people would never
6359000	6361000	pay for music once Napster
6361000	6363000	and LimeWire and all that was a thing and then
6363000	6365000	iTunes came out charged
6365000	6367000	a reasonable rate made it real easy
6367000	6369000	and completely changed the
6369000	6371000	industry and of course now we're in a day
6371000	6373000	iTunes is still doing its thing
6373000	6375000	but now it's probably more on that side Apple
6375000	6377000	Music and Spotify and Pandora
6377000	6379000	and everything in that streaming space
6379000	6381000	ironically here we are talking about streaming
6381000	6383000	that legitimizes it so
6383000	6385000	anyway enough talk about that let's move on
6385000	6387000	to another rapid fire story Dark Sakura
6387000	6389000	Well it's finally happening
6389000	6391000	and we've kept bringing it up but Bloodstained
6391000	6393000	is happening yay
6393000	6395000	Finally. Um so
6395000	6397000	it looks like we have a
6397000	6399000	release date for Xbox One, PS4
6399000	6401000	and PC that's gonna be on
6401000	6403000	June 18th and the Switch
6403000	6405000	version will be out on June 25th
6405000	6407000	um but
6407000	6409000	the time seems to have been just
6409000	6411000	from what I you know I can tell
6411000	6413000	that the extra development time should really make it a
6413000	6415000	very stellar release. Did you see that
6415000	6417000	trailer they put out recently that had like
6417000	6419000	Igarashi in it going we heard
6419000	6421000	that you thought the graphics were crap
6421000	6423000	so we made it better it was very self
6423000	6425000	aware again going back to what we kicked
6425000	6427000	off the show with this week fan backlash
6427000	6429000	causing changes. Well
6429000	6431000	it does look really good. But yeah it is
6431000	6433000	designed by Igarashi
6433000	6435000	Koji who is such
6435000	6437000	a rock star that was like the happy thing
6437000	6439000	of my last E3 was getting to meet him
6439000	6441000	and then
6441000	6443000	of course the thing that actually I'm most
6443000	6445000	excited about is the music because
6445000	6447000	the music is
6447000	6449000	done by Yamare Michiru
6449000	6451000	who was the lady who did all the music
6451000	6453000	for Symphony of the Night and
6453000	6455000	Yamare Ippo who was
6455000	6457000	Resident Evil
6457000	6459000	musician
6459000	6461000	so I'm really really looking forward
6461000	6463000	to that also it's supposed to be like an even
6463000	6465000	bigger castle like the largest
6465000	6467000	one in any of Igarashi's games
6467000	6469000	so I'm excited
6469000	6471000	I might be a little bit
6471000	6473000	more excited than I can
6473000	6475000	safely keep us PG rated
6475000	6477000	In this game my dick is
6477000	6479000	bigger than ever with this castle
6479000	6481000	right? Yeah
6481000	6483000	his castle dick
6483000	6485000	and then of course there's been
6485000	6487000	this trailer floating around for
6487000	6489000	Left 4 Dead 3
6489000	6491000	yeah it's fake
6491000	6493000	It's fake. If you believe that Valve was doing
6493000	6495000	a game with a 3 in it you were setting yourself up
6495000	6497000	for failure. Yeah
6497000	6499000	I believe someday that that's gonna
6499000	6501000	happen
6501000	6503000	and it'll be all of the games all the
6503000	6505000	3. Today is not that day. No.
6505000	6507000	But you can
6507000	6509000	pretty much you can
6509000	6511000	look at it there's some other
6511000	6513000	red flags that
6513000	6515000	indicate that it's fake apart from
6515000	6517000	Valve just denying it
6517000	6519000	you know there's like
6519000	6521000	licensed items in
6521000	6523000	the game like Quaker Oats
6523000	6525000	and they
6525000	6527000	use like maps in it from some of the
6527000	6529000	other games so yeah if
6529000	6531000	you look at it you can tell
6531000	6533000	but
6533000	6535000	the only thing that we've really seen are
6535000	6537000	just some like allegedly
6537000	6539000	leaked environmental screenshots
6539000	6541000	Didn't we have a story
6541000	6543000	just like 2 or 3 weeks ago too that the
6543000	6545000	Left 4 Dead team was working on it or like
6545000	6547000	a lot of people that were involved with it were
6547000	6549000	working on a very similar type of thing
6549000	6551000	much akin to this burn out
6551000	6553000	Destruction Derby or whatever
6553000	6555000	that game is called they just put it out
6555000	6557000	and I need to play it. Destructive
6557000	6559000	Driving or something like that.
6559000	6561000	Dangerous driving. Dangerous driving that's it.
6561000	6563000	I'll be honest too. I went back
6563000	6565000	to look at some of the screenshots
6565000	6567000	and they don't look like they would be anything
6567000	6569000	in a
6569000	6571000	Left 4 Dead game like it's not
6571000	6573000	anything that looks relatively modern
6573000	6575000	unless it's like in Italy
6575000	6577000	really damaged
6577000	6579000	Italy or somewhere in the
6579000	6581000	Middle East. Sorry I can't stop laughing
6581000	6583000	Maybe Greece. I can't stop laughing now
6583000	6585000	at calling that game Distracted Driving because now
6585000	6587000	I'm just imagining a trailer that just
6587000	6589000	shows like clips from burn out
6589000	6591000	when you text on your phone and drive
6591000	6593000	and then massive burn out
6593000	6595000	you could cause an accident
6595000	6597000	and by the way
6597000	6599000	if anyone wants to see the
6599000	6601000	images referred to
6601000	6603000	it's a short URL so it's
6603000	6605000	pronounced Imgur
6605000	6607000	Imgur?
6607000	6609000	Imgur.com
6609000	6611000	a like alpha slash b like
6611000	6613000	bravo c like Charlie capital w
6613000	6615000	like whiskey lowercase f like

6617000	6619000	juliet 8
6619000	6621000	Hope you write fast. It was Back 4
6621000	6623000	Blood was their game. Back 4 Blood thank you
6623000	6625000	Well and
6625000	6627000	marvel at my NATO alphabet skills yo
6627000	6629000	Alright let's
6629000	6631000	move on and I'll link this in the chat
6631000	6633000	Let's find some things that are coming out
6633000	6635000	soon as we look at some
6635000	6637000	world release dates and some things that are coming out
6637000	6639000	since Left 4 Dead 3 will not be
6639000	6641000	Alright
6641000	6643000	Well we're only getting a few
6643000	6645000	games out this week so Life is Strange
6645000	6647000	2 Episode 3 Wasteland
6647000	6649000	that's coming on PC PlayStation 4 and Xbox
6649000	6651000	1 Yakuza
6651000	6653000	Kiwami 2 is out on
6653000	6655000	PC and finally
6655000	6657000	Saints Row 3rd coming out on
6657000	6659000	Nintendo Switch
6659000	6661000	That's it
6661000	6663000	Alright and if we travel to Japan
6663000	6665000	there's no releases in Japan this week
6665000	6667000	I believe Golden Week was last week
6667000	6669000	maybe wrapping up right now. I don't remember exactly
6669000	6671000	Everyone's coming back
6671000	6673000	I don't remember exactly how many days it is but regardless
6673000	6675000	it would be similar to like
6675000	6677000	the day after Christmas. You're not gonna see any
6677000	6679000	games come out. If I'm correct in Golden Week
6679000	6681000	one of the holidays involved in that
6681000	6683000	has
6683000	6685000	people going back to their hometowns
6685000	6687000	so quite likely people
6687000	6689000	would be coming back
6689000	6691000	so no point in releasing
6691000	6693000	anything. I mean it's a big deal there
6693000	6695000	to like what Christmas is here
6695000	6697000	when people travel and go
6697000	6699000	they're gone for days and so forth
6699000	6701000	so just like here
6701000	6703000	Business is shut down. Yeah you don't get
6703000	6705000	the game releases don't pick up until
6705000	6707000	mid-January after Christmas
6707000	6709000	maybe you get
6709000	6711000	now we're getting to see one or two big ones that will come out
6711000	6713000	in a couple weeks after but yeah
6713000	6715000	anyway long story short no releases in Japan
6715000	6717000	right now but there's good reason for it
6717000	6719000	just with the culture over there so
6719000	6721000	I will turn it over to Europe, Dark Sakura
6721000	6723000	All of these come out
6723000	6725000	on May 9th
6725000	6727000	and all of them are for Switch
6727000	6729000	so Farm Expert 2019
6729000	6731000	Mortal Kombat 11
6731000	6733000	and Saints Row the Third
6733000	6735000	the full package
6735000	6737000	An
6737000	6739000	autoplay video on this site, sorry
6739000	6741000	okay but that's all
6741000	6743000	okay let's move on
6743000	6745000	and we will go to the mailbag
6745000	6747000	you guys send us emails
6747000	6749000	participate at orange lounge radio
6749000	6751000	dot com and we
6751000	6753000	love to read these emails live on air
6753000	6755000	and I believe we have one email tonight
6755000	6757000	that we do saving you
6757000	6759000	from Drag Race discussion
6759000	6761000	yay thank you
6761000	6763000	girl I got stuff to say about Silky
6763000	6765000	I know justice for that
6765000	6767000	email that sloppy bitch
6767000	6769000	anyway hello L.R.
6769000	6771000	I wanted to let Rob
6771000	6773000	know that his memory has not failed him
6773000	6775000	there was in fact a two
6775000	6777000	versus two mode in Ultimate Mortal Kombat
6777000	6779000	3 I knew it it was relatively
6779000	6781000	basic there was no tagging in or out
6781000	6783000	just the second member of a team appearing
6783000	6785000	when the first was KO'd and the round
6785000	6787000	ending when both members are KO'd
6787000	6789000	it would still
6789000	6791000	it was still best two out of three
6791000	6793000	it wasn't played very often
6793000	6795000	though since it cost double the price of an ordinary
6795000	6797000	versus match and it didn't typically
6797000	6799000	last twice as long I'm sure
6799000	6801000	that a lot of folks forgot about it
6801000	6803000	that is that everything is saying is correct
6803000	6805000	but the arcade operator could set the price
6805000	6807000	of that I think the default was
6807000	6809000	double but I remember a place that
6809000	6811000	was only like one credit to do
6811000	6813000	that mode and it's a good way to like
6813000	6815000	sample I mean the game had already been out for years
6815000	6817000	at that point but it's a good way to sample multiple characters
6817000	6819000	when you're like I don't know if I want to play Katana or
6819000	6821000	Melina so you can do both
6821000	6823000	so that's what was cool about it
6823000	6825000	that would be team sibling rivalry
6825000	6827000	yes
6827000	6829000	team I think I'm a clone now
6829000	6831000	personally
6831000	6833000	I was far more interested in Ultimate Mortal Combat 3's
6833000	6835000	eight player tournament mode
6835000	6837000	which set up a single elimination
6837000	6839000	tournament consisting of one round matches
6839000	6841000	between eight players the thing
6841000	6843000	cost eight credits to play but it was
6843000	6845000	well worth it because when all the matches
6845000	6847000	finished and a winner was crowned that person
6847000	6849000	got to select any of the ending rewards
6849000	6851000	available in the game including the supreme
6851000	6853000	demonstration remember that
6853000	6855000	the machine would play every single finishing
6855000	6857000	move in the game which would take
6857000	6859000	over seven minutes and
6859000	6861000	he sent us a link that I'm
6861000	6863000	going to post in chat
6863000	6865000	her request
6865000	6867000	we'll do a midpoint break some week
6867000	6869000	where we just play the finishing move
6869000	6871000	actually that would be a perfect bathroom
6871000	6873000	break because it's seven minutes
6873000	6875000	I never
6875000	6877000	saw that mode I heard about it but I
6877000	6879000	never saw that tournament mode ever
6879000	6881000	actually get used
6881000	6883000	so I have exactly
6883000	6885000	once yeah so actually
6885000	6887000	I love that you sent this email to
6887000	6889000	kind of remind us I was like oh is that what it
6889000	6891000	did or I guess that's one of the options
6891000	6893000	but still that's really cool
6893000	6895000	at any rate I just posted it
6895000	6897000	in the chat and
6897000	6899000	if we want to add it in to maybe
6899000	6901000	show notes for posting the podcast
6901000	6903000	so if I remember I'll do my
6903000	6905000	best it's a YouTube so I'm sure if
6905000	6907000	you just Google it it's a tube of the you
6907000	6909000	yes or are you sure you don't want me to read the URL
6909000	6911000	girl it's a lot
6911000	6913000	more complicated than what I read
6913000	6915000	anyway thanks again for the show
6915000	6917000	and have a great week hugs
6917000	6919000	Aaron YYR
6919000	6921000	well thanks thanks for that
6921000	6923000	I'm always down to talk about the old school Mortal Kombats
6923000	6925000	well I don't know it's just
6925000	6927000	sort of been like I've been in this
6927000	6929000	like crazy Mortal Kombat nostalgia
6929000	6931000	if you go to
6931000	6933000	my fan page
6933000	6935000	which is Dark Sakura
6935000	6937000	I will link it in chat
6937000	6939000	for those here
6939000	6941000	wink wink nudge nudge nudge nudge like my status
6941000	6943000	well not just that actually
6943000	6945000	follow my page
6945000	6947000	but I linked
6947000	6949000	the old making of Mortal Kombat
6949000	6951000	so
6951000	6953000	which is pretty cool it's just basically how they did
6953000	6955000	a lot of the mocap this is a very
6955000	6957000	cool watch I mean it also
6957000	6959000	talks into just how primitive
6959000	6961000	their mocap techniques were back then and how
6961000	6963000	it's evolved to what we have now
6963000	6965000	so yeah that was the only other
6965000	6967000	email so thank you YYR
6967000	6969000	Toshin a blast from the past
6969000	6971000	in our chat tonight good to see you
6971000	6973000	is in our chat saying a good thing the
6973000	6975000	new arcade 1up cabs out now
6975000	6977000	make the modes more accessible
6977000	6979000	you know I gotta say if I'm a really
6979000	6981000	good boy on my spending I think I'm gonna buy myself
6981000	6983000	one of those cabinets I just
6983000	6985000	I want it
6985000	6987000	I don't
6987000	6989000	I want it there's just no
6989000	6991000	other explanation I want it
6991000	6993000	I want the Tempest one
6993000	6995000	but
6995000	6997000	Black Knight sort of rage
6997000	6999000	oh yeah that's right you got that
6999000	7001000	Dan's like we'll be fine with the pro fuck no
7001000	7003000	it's not Black Knight without having the second
7003000	7005000	play field I want a fucking premium
7005000	7007000	stomp my foot
7007000	7009000	Veruca Salt moment
7009000	7011000	Bob Coffee in chat says the arcade 1up cabinets
7011000	7013000	are okay yeah I know they're not like the real thing
7013000	7015000	and they're smaller and it's a different type of screen
7015000	7017000	I want one!
7017000	7019000	I think those are bigger though aren't those
7019000	7021000	what they have like I think a little
7021000	7023000	I thought that they were bigger because I know that
7023000	7025000	like the Atari ones and stuff they have like a pedestal
7025000	7027000	that you put the cabinet on to make them
7027000	7029000	taller but I thought those were
7029000	7031000	just already taller because I mean
7031000	7033000	children aren't gonna be playing moral combat
7033000	7035000	it's a mature rated game right
7035000	7037000	yeah sure you wouldn't let
7037000	7039000	your kids play it would you?
7039000	7041000	they wouldn't be interested
7041000	7043000	exactly I probably would let them but
7043000	7045000	they wouldn't be interested
7045000	7047000	this is too hard
7047000	7049000	I just remember though the biggest hype
7049000	7051000	about any Mortal Kombat ever in my experience
7051000	7053000	was Mortal Kombat 2 and this was
7053000	7055000	the year that we were taking the trip up the
7055000	7057000	east coast for my high school band
7057000	7059000	we actually played at Carnegie Hall
7059000	7061000	and that was when all the
7061000	7063000	beta machines were still out
7063000	7065000	all up the east coast
7065000	7067000	so we were like
7067000	7069000	which beta is this? and we had
7069000	7071000	everyone would have like three different print outs
7071000	7073000	based on the beta version that we would
7073000	7075000	try to figure out what we were playing
7075000	7077000	yeah I remember the first time
7077000	7079000	I saw Mortal Kombat 2 my mind was blown
7079000	7081000	I saw it at like a bowling alley
7081000	7083000	and like you know I'm sure we all saw the first game
7083000	7085000	and played it but like the second one was like
7085000	7087000	somehow the graphics were even
7087000	7089000	better even though it was still that whole like
7089000	7091000	digitized people thing and it was just like my mind was
7091000	7093000	blown like so good
7093000	7095000	so and then I remember
7095000	7097000	seeing the third game for the first time and I was also
7097000	7099000	like wow this looks like really different
7099000	7101000	but I don't know even as much as I enjoy
7101000	7103000	the third game like it just it wasn't the
7103000	7105000	same as 2 I don't know what it is
7105000	7107000	2 just had like the magic
7107000	7109000	that 1 built
7109000	7111000	yeah cause 1 is
7111000	7113000	kind of hard to go back and play it because it was a
7113000	7115000	very slow game I think 3's
7115000	7117000	biggest problem was taking Sub-Zero's mask
7117000	7119000	off it just didn't feel the same
7119000	7121000	yeah but 2
7121000	7123000	had all the charm
7123000	7125000	and violence of 1
7125000	7127000	but it was at a more playable speed
7127000	7129000	it was a faster game
7129000	7131000	alright anyhow
7131000	7133000	ok well our mailbag segment
7133000	7135000	turned into Mortal Kombat talk but hey that's ok
7135000	7137000	let's move on to some more
7137000	7139000	news alright now
7139000	7141000	Loki now what does it say up there
7141000	7143000	now what can we talk about
7143000	7145000	at this point in the show
7147000	7149000	fine I'm sure you have
7149000	7151000	some choice things to say to me right
7151000	7153000	so
7153000	7155000	Microsoft you know well aware
7155000	7157000	that their Xbox Live service is
7157000	7159000	full of the
7159000	7161000	best people so they
7161000	7163000	decided that they're gonna put out
7163000	7165000	acceptable trash talk examples
7165000	7167000	what I hadn't heard
7167000	7169000	and what not to do
7169000	7171000	when you're trash talking
7171000	7173000	so for example
7173000	7175000	some things that you shouldn't say
7175000	7177000	hey profanity
7177000	7179000	that was some serious potato aim
7179000	7181000	get wrecked trash
7181000	7183000	who the fuck talks like that?
7183000	7185000	nobody talks like that
7185000	7187000	that was a very potato reading
7187000	7189000	get wrecked trash
7189000	7191000	the only reason you went positive
7191000	7193000	was you spent all game camping
7193000	7195000	kys kid
7195000	7197000	ok well you shouldn't tell children to kill
7197000	7199000	themselves you know what kys means right
7199000	7201000	yes I gather yes
7201000	7203000	kiss your savior
7203000	7205000	kiss your savior
7205000	7207000	cheap win
7207000	7209000	totally expected from a racial
7209000	7211000	slur
7211000	7213000	racial slurs are not ok I'm not gonna make fun of that
7213000	7215000	one they do need to get rid of those
7215000	7217000	but anyways yeah so they have this whole
7217000	7219000	website and they actually
7219000	7221000	broke it down by like different
7221000	7223000	categories of like how what you should
7223000	7225000	and should not do like attitude
7225000	7227000	and standards
7227000	7229000	keep it legal
7229000	7231000	attitude check
7231000	7233000	anyone? says Xbox Lives
7233000	7235000	Ville in all countries for example

7239000	7241000	create messages that encourage
7241000	7243000	underage drinking don't do that
7243000	7245000	tell other players to kill
7245000	7247000	themselves or commit self harm
7247000	7249000	don't do that upload
7249000	7251000	custom gamer pics that show animal
7251000	7253000	abuse why would you
7253000	7255000	do that

7257000	7259000	spam into substance
7259000	7261000	turning spam into substance regularly offering
7261000	7263000	prizes in exchange for follows

7373000	7375000	or that are not explicitly supported
7375000	7377000	by game developers you wouldn't
7377000	7379000	mod your game would you
7379000	7381000	exploit to duplicate
7381000	7383000	in-game items don't do
7383000	7385000	that bad people
7389000	7391000	connect modified or tampered
7391000	7393000	hardware to the Xbox Live
7395000	7397000	god this sounds lame
7397000	7399000	how about I do none of those things
7399000	7401000	we know that Xbox Live is this forever
7401000	7403000	punchline about that it's just trash
7403000	7405000	when you go on there and you
7405000	7407000	use voice chat so I understand
7407000	7409000	that Microsoft is under some pressure
7409000	7411000	to do literally anything about it
7411000	7413000	so this is that like it's
7413000	7415000	it's something it may not be much
7415000	7417000	but I know I've learned the term potato
7417000	7419000	aim I'm gonna use that
7419000	7421000	in a sentence at some point
7421000	7423000	that's how that's how I play overwatch
7423000	7425000	with my potato aim
7425000	7427000	straight Idaho
7427000	7429000	potato aim
7431000	7433000	anyway
7433000	7435000	Mr. Smoosh is yelling in the
7435000	7437000	other room that I have potato aim right now
7437000	7439000	be right back
7439000	7441000	I have to go cuddle him against his will
7441000	7443000	Bobby Blackwolf in chat says my potato aim
7443000	7445000	is so bad it's not even from Idaho
7451000	7453000	so like I'm trying to understand what they
7453000	7455000	I'm trying to fill in their blanks
7455000	7457000	here so get sexual threat
7457000	7459000	can't believe you thought you were on my
7459000	7461000	level like get fucked is that
7461000	7463000	like a sexual threat either get
7463000	7465000	fucked or get what
7465000	7467000	you would call if you force sex upon
7467000	7469000	someone against their will
7469000	7471000	I've I've heard of that one being
7471000	7473000	uh flinged around on Xbox Live
7473000	7475000	and it's not okay just to be
7475000	7477000	explicitly clear so
7477000	7479000	anyway again
7479000	7481000	Microsoft has to do something but
7481000	7483000	yeah at the end of the day if they're
7483000	7485000	not gonna ban people for being fuckheads
7485000	7487000	which I guess maybe I'm not supposed to
7487000	7489000	say but when you do say these types of things
7489000	7491000	you are in fact being a fuckhead so
7491000	7493000	what about just say get consensually
7493000	7495000	fucked like well
7495000	7497000	I don't know I don't because that that's
7497000	7499000	no I
7499000	7501000	anyway moving on
7501000	7503000	let's talk let's talk
7503000	7505000	about a company that is banning some fools
7505000	7507000	uh respawn behind
7507000	7509000	apex legends of course y'all playing some
7509000	7511000	apex legends well uh
7511000	7513000	770,000 of you just got
7513000	7515000	banned congratulations
7515000	7517000	although I would guess this is
7517000	7519000	probably not 770,000 individual
7519000	7521000	people this is probably
7521000	7523000	770 trolls with 1000
7523000	7525000	accounts or something along those lines
7525000	7527000	anyhow uh
7527000	7529000	respawn did I was
7529000	7531000	kind of looking at this going didn't we kind of
7531000	7533000	already have this and yeah
7533000	7535000	this is a follow up because respawn did
7535000	7537000	they said we've still got plans to deal with
7537000	7539000	cheaters we're not gonna tell you what those plans are
7539000	7541000	because we don't want you circumventing it so it has
7541000	7543000	to be a little bit vague but there was
7543000	7545000	another blog post that said
7545000	7547000	uh the recent added in-game
7547000	7549000	reporting tools had a big impact on
7549000	7551000	discovering new cheats including
7551000	7553000	previously undetectable cheats that are now being
7553000	7555000	found automatically via EAC
7555000	7557000	what's EAC is that EAC's cheat
7557000	7559000	controller is that an acronym for something else
7559000	7561000	EAC it's gotta be some probably some
7561000	7563000	yeah uh anyway total
7563000	7565000	bands are now at 770,000
7565000	7567000	players we've blocked
7567000	7569000	300,000 account creations
7569000	7571000	we've banned 4,000 cheat
7571000	7573000	seller accounts spammers in the
7573000	7575000	last 20 days total
7575000	7577000	matches on PC impacted by cheaters
7577000	7579000	or spammers has been reduced by over half
7579000	7581000	in the last month due to recent efforts
7581000	7583000	in a quote here
7583000	7585000	from Drew McCoy the executive producer
7585000	7587000	it is a constant war with the cheat
7587000	7589000	makers that we will continue to fight we take
7589000	7591000	cheating in Apex Legends incredibly seriously
7591000	7593000	and have a large amount of resources tackling
7593000	7595000	it from a variety of angles
7595000	7597000	uh saying he will be back next week
7597000	7599000	with an update on another one of these issues
7599000	7601000	called out in last week's post so
7601000	7603000	you better look out cause uh
7603000	7605000	Drew McCoy and the rest of the uh
7605000	7607000	Apex team is coming for you and
7607000	7609000	stop cheating in multiplayer games
7609000	7611000	like if you want to cheat in a single player game
7611000	7613000	or if you want to form your own little
7613000	7615000	instance with your friends where you're all
7615000	7617000	consensually cheating and all that stuff fine
7617000	7619000	go off have fun but
7619000	7621000	like don't inflict that stuff on strangers who
7621000	7623000	just want to play the game and have a good time alright
7623000	7625000	calm down so anyway
7625000	7627000	um yeah
7627000	7629000	it's true SD100 Matt says trolls find a way
7629000	7631000	active says trolls gonna troll
7631000	7633000	uh DJ Rama S says EAC is something called
7633000	7635000	easy anti cheat so I'm just I'm not
7635000	7637000	familiar with the uh term there so
7637000	7639000	alright well uh
7639000	7641000	yeah don't don't be a jerk
7641000	7643000	in Apex Legends that's the
7643000	7645000	that's the thing to take away from this
7645000	7647000	but it is an extremely
7647000	7649000	popular online game right now like
7649000	7651000	I don't is it still outperforming Fortnite
7651000	7653000	or how is that all calm down on Twitch
7653000	7655000	I don't know haven't looked at the rankings lately
7655000	7657000	probably pretty close it's it's still up there
7657000	7659000	until the next thing comes out you can't ignore
7659000	7661000	how uh what a big game it is right now
7661000	7663000	speaking of big games
7663000	7665000	whether Bobby Blackwolf wants to
7665000	7667000	believe it or not there's still a big one out there on mobile
7667000	7669000	right DarkSakura?
7669000	7671000	there's the Pokemans
7671000	7673000	uh there is
7673000	7675000	a uh
7675000	7677000	release of actually a
7677000	7679000	confirmation of information the Pokemon Go
7679000	7681000	community basically investigated into
7681000	7683000	the new late guardians but Niantic actually
7683000	7685000	did announce that Uxie
7685000	7687000	Mesprite
7687000	7689000	and Azelf
7689000	7691000	whatever names um
7691000	7693000	are all going to be available via
7693000	7695000	region specific raids through May
7695000	7697000	27th
7697000	7699000	they were random spawns
7699000	7701000	they were hard to find but now you can
7701000	7703000	get them from your
7703000	7705000	raids Asia Pacific
7705000	7707000	is gonna get Uxie
7707000	7709000	Eastern
7709000	7711000	sorry European Union Middle East
7711000	7713000	Africa India gets Mesprite
7713000	7715000	and America and Greenland
7715000	7717000	get Azelf
7717000	7719000	so there you go
7719000	7721000	there the late guardians from gen 4
7721000	7723000	now I know they haven't confirmed
7723000	7725000	this yet but my assumption is
7725000	7727000	that these guys are gonna rotate
7727000	7729000	cause didn't the dogs from gen 2
7729000	7731000	they did the same thing like
7731000	7733000	one region got you know one dog
7733000	7735000	another got you know another
7735000	7737000	and then they rotated so like this should be like
7737000	7739000	the next three months worth of raids right
7739000	7741000	yeah that's my assumption anyway
7741000	7743000	so interesting
7743000	7745000	uh I have yet to catch one you know
7745000	7747000	I as much as you know we tease
7747000	7749000	Bobby Blockwolf and I know he's teasing us right back
7749000	7751000	when he says hashtag dead game
7751000	7753000	and we're like no it's not um I
7753000	7755000	I do notice that like
7755000	7757000	the raid scene is kinda
7757000	7759000	it's at least around me it's kinda slowing
7759000	7761000	down cause I think people are just getting a little burned out
7761000	7763000	kinda feels like it's just like the same thing
7763000	7765000	and the Pokemon aren't that exciting
7765000	7767000	and there's so many events
7767000	7769000	I'm not sure what the game could do
7769000	7771000	to really wake people up I don't know if the
7771000	7773000	secret is just release gen 5
7773000	7775000	I don't know
7775000	7777000	do you think there's something Pokemon Go
7777000	7779000	could do to get people kinda like back
7779000	7781000	interested in it again
7781000	7783000	make it competitive
7783000	7785000	yeah I mean they have PVP
7785000	7787000	well they have PVP but it's kinda
7787000	7789000	it's very much a side show you know what I mean
7789000	7791000	I don't know I think it's fun right now
7791000	7793000	uh oh Totion
7793000	7795000	in chat says Niantic said no rotation
7795000	7797000	right now what
7797000	7799000	I think they really want people to trade
7799000	7801000	for that stuff you're gonna have to really be able to
7801000	7803000	trade long distance stuff I think they're gonna
7803000	7805000	end up doing the rotation or they'll
7805000	7807000	they'll make it like quest
7807000	7809000	rewards or something like that I don't know
7809000	7811000	that's probably what's gonna end up happening
7811000	7813000	we'll see or maybe you'll have to
7813000	7815000	get real lucky and catch them in the wild
7815000	7817000	which apparently has been a thing going on
7817000	7819000	alright well Loki along
7819000	7821000	the Pokemon lines yeah so they're doing
7821000	7823000	this brand new app that's coming out now
7823000	7825000	called Pokemon Pass
7825000	7827000	which is gonna be separate from Pokemon Go
7827000	7829000	but you can actually get Pokemon
7829000	7831000	much like you did in the 3DS or
7831000	7833000	the DS at different locations
7833000	7835000	they'll unlock different things
7835000	7837000	like for example the first
7837000	7839000	thing that's gonna be
7839000	7841000	available is on
7841000	7843000	May 11th and if you have
7843000	7845000	Pokemon Let's Go with the app it'll allow you
7845000	7847000	to unlock a shiny Pikachu or
7847000	7849000	shiny Eevee for Let's Go
7849000	7851000	so that's if you go to Target
7851000	7853000	and
7853000	7855000	use your app there
7855000	7857000	ok wait so you're gonna have to
7857000	7859000	scan a QR code? I think
7859000	7861000	so that's it?
7861000	7863000	like you use this
7863000	7865000	app to scan a QR code
7865000	7867000	and so I have to go to Target
7867000	7869000	to get that QR code gosh
7869000	7871000	there's no possible way
7871000	7873000	a QR code
7873000	7875000	that correct me if I'm wrong never
7875000	7877000	changes right Loki it's just gonna be the same
7877000	7879000	QR code on like a cardboard I don't know that
7879000	7881000	yeah there's no way
7881000	7883000	that like I don't know if somebody
7883000	7885000	could take like a picture of that and
7885000	7887000	put it on
7887000	7889000	the internet and I could just
7889000	7891000	scan my monitor
7891000	7893000	if it's like a poster up
7893000	7895000	on the wall yes
7895000	7897000	if it's like an app or something like
7897000	7899000	in the store like a kiosk or something that
7899000	7901000	generates a unique QR code
7901000	7903000	for you then perhaps
7903000	7905000	ok that's gonna be a little harder yeah
7905000	7907000	let's think about the minimal
7907000	7909000	viable product here it's gonna be a fucking
7909000	7911000	poster and that'll
7911000	7913000	be up on the internet immediately and
7913000	7915000	yeah
7915000	7917000	cause that's what happened with the um
7917000	7919000	god what was that game
7919000	7921000	that was trying to compete against Pokemon
7921000	7923000	yokai watch ok so yokai watch had
7923000	7925000	QR codes in it right and there was kind of like
7925000	7927000	a similar thing with the anime I think had
7927000	7929000	QR codes in it you could like scan it in the anime
7929000	7931000	yeah that shit was on the internet in days
7931000	7933000	you know hours minutes
7933000	7935000	you know it's just not
7935000	7937000	yeah I'm sure that's what's gonna happen with Pokemon
7937000	7939000	pass as well but hey I
7939000	7941000	hey I'm all for extra
7941000	7943000	things and extra perks in these
7943000	7945000	games fun right
7945000	7947000	why not yeah we'll see maybe
7947000	7949000	if if they then and act F
7949000	7951000	and chat is telling me about the last story with the
7951000	7953000	Pokemon rights they'll keep them regional since they'll
7953000	7955000	still be appearing in the wild maybe I'll have to use
7955000	7957000	a QR code to get them maybe that'll be
7957000	7959000	the thing who knows
7959000	7961000	we'll see what Pokemon pass lends
7961000	7963000	itself to later
7963000	7965000	act F says the QR is already on the
7965000	7967000	internet well that didn't take long uh
7967000	7969000	and maybe you know what maybe this is how they
7969000	7971000	plan to do
7971000	7973000	the legendary distributions
7973000	7975000	uh for the gen 8
7975000	7977000	games for um
7977000	7979000	I already forget the name sword and shield
7979000	7981000	and gun
7981000	7983000	this is how they plan to distribute
7983000	7985000	for sword and shield is that
7985000	7987000	they're gonna use this app and do it instead of those
7987000	7989000	game stop cards with the codes
7989000	7991000	who knows anyway

8009000	8011000	slash discord but uh
8011000	8013000	our last official story tonight has to do with
8013000	8015000	a game that's pretty old at this point but it was on a ton
8015000	8017000	of uh it was like on PC it was on the original
8017000	8019000	Wii it was on it was all over it's a game called
8019000	8021000	World of Goo well
8021000	8023000	World of Goo got a PC
8023000	8025000	update this week and that game hasn't been
8025000	8027000	updated in probably 10 years
8027000	8029000	what's interesting about this update
8029000	8031000	this isn't some little like bug fix
8031000	8033000	all these years later update or things like that
8033000	8035000	actually what's really cool about this
8035000	8037000	it changes the
8037000	8039000	resolutions to now do a
8039000	8041000	16 by 9 display because when the game
8041000	8043000	came out 4 by 3 was a little bit
8043000	8045000	more of the standard and it
8045000	8047000	has an HD makeover because the original
8047000	8049000	resolution of the game only ran at
8049000	8051000	800 by 600 so
8051000	8053000	no no HD version
8053000	8055000	no no remaster just
8055000	8057000	an update to World of Goo to make
8057000	8059000	it better I should point out though
8059000	8061000	no new levels no new challenges
8061000	8063000	they didn't really change anything in the game but still very
8063000	8065000	cool that they are updating it to support
8065000	8067000	more modern PCs
8067000	8069000	so hooray for that
8069000	8071000	a polite applause for a
8071000	8073000	game maker willing to go back and update their very old
8073000	8075000	game but again I think a lot of people probably
8075000	8077000	own this because they just it was so many sales
8077000	8079000	and so many things of that
8079000	8081000	nature and so forth I'm just uh
8081000	8083000	very very uh happy to
8083000	8085000	see that so alright
8085000	8087000	so anyway um
8087000	8089000	oh gosh okay I don't
8089000	8091000	I don't usually read these on air
8091000	8093000	I don't usually read all these at once because it
8093000	8095000	kind of derails the show a little bit but this is a big one
8095000	8097000	and plus we're getting into the listener round table anyway
8097000	8099000	so it's appropriate to read it this time
8099000	8101000	um but I do want to acknowledge this we
8101000	8105000	just got 3,500 biddies
8105000	8107000	from that's a lot of biddies
8107000	8109000	we just got 3,500 biddies
8109000	8111000	from uh schmagtastic in our
8111000	8113000	chat saying um and I hope
8113000	8115000	I said your name right I'm sorry if I butchered
8115000	8117000	it especially after what a sweet gesture that is
8117000	8119000	saying this podcast was
8119000	8121000	literally my adolescence and has transcended
8121000	8123000	into my adulthood again
8123000	8125000	just extending my gratitude to you all
8125000	8127000	for such a great community and podcast
8127000	8129000	so allow me to express
8129000	8131000	my gratitude for you uh
8131000	8133000	for for doing that and uh thank you
8133000	8135000	um it's and it's not just about the biddies
8135000	8137000	I mean don't get me wrong appreciate it but
8137000	8139000	uh just even
8139000	8141000	just saying that just the fact that
8141000	8143000	we've had that impact on somebody
8143000	8145000	in some sort of little way just means
8145000	8147000	a lot that's it
8147000	8149000	always kind of blows me away like for one
8149000	8151000	that we've been doing this show as long as we
8151000	8153000	have
8153000	8155000	and the other is just like how many people
8155000	8157000	have really stuck with us for
8157000	8159000	um as long you know and I realized
8159000	8161000	people come and people go and I
8161000	8163000	I know I name checked um
8163000	8165000	toshin earlier in the show who was kind of like
8165000	8167000	I think a listener back in the like all games
8167000	8169000	days which was a while ago at this point
8169000	8171000	right Boggs been around since about 2012
8171000	8173000	um and so all games when did all games
8173000	8175000	start all games started I think around 2006
8175000	8177000	well I'm sorry when we joined all games
8177000	8179000	around before that you know what I mean um
8179000	8181000	our time with them started in like 2006
8181000	8183000	so I mean just to think like
8183000	8185000	oh my god like they were listening I'm a PSP
8185000	8187000	how many years are really
8187000	8189000	shminktastic was on the beat I'm telling you that
8189000	8191000	PSP thing doesn't get enough
8191000	8193000	credit I would say that that OLR
8193000	8195000	PSP rest in peace because it's
8195000	8197000	sadly it's no longer there because I mean
8197000	8199000	why would it be but that
8199000	8201000	OLR PSP probably brought
8201000	8203000	more people to OLR
8203000	8205000	than anything else in our history
8205000	8207000	save for the launch of
8207000	8209000	iTunes podcasting and us being
8209000	8211000	one of the original shows in it that's
8211000	8213000	probably the only thing I can
8213000	8215000	think of there that really comes close
8215000	8217000	so yeah
8217000	8219000	that's and there's so many folks in chat yeah
8219000	8221000	OLR PSP I listen on the
8221000	8223000	PSP too fuck I wish I could make lightning
8223000	8225000	strike twice too bad there wasn't an OLR
8225000	8227000	Vita but it wasn't really the same thing on the
8227000	8229000	Vita the PSP was different because
8229000	8231000	we were really able to build
8231000	8233000	something there that really felt like
8233000	8235000	you were like unlocking a new
8235000	8237000	ability within your PSP you know what I mean
8237000	8239000	with the whole listing on shoutcast like
8239000	8241000	a lot of people didn't really know how to do that and you made it
8241000	8243000	so easy with that website and it
8243000	8245000	looked really cool and was like built for a
8245000	8247000	PSP of mine that I just think like
8247000	8249000	yeah again anyway I
8249000	8251000	just is it on like one of those like web
8251000	8253000	archives or something the OLR PSP site
8253000	8255000	it's gotta be like there's gotta be a way for
8255000	8257000	you guys to see it and what it like for those
8257000	8259000	have no idea what I'm talking about if you're like newer to the show
8259000	8261000	because it really was for
8261000	8263000	for the time it was really cool
8263000	8265000	I'm actually trying to learn Swift
8265000	8267000	so I can make
8267000	8269000	an iOS app
8269000	8271000	oh that'd be sweet for us
8271000	8273000	I I'm just starting
8273000	8275000	my research so
8275000	8277000	I mean to be fair maybe all of fog network
8277000	8279000	would want an app but yeah you know
8279000	8281000	I started
8281000	8283000	I mean I had started on the idea
8283000	8285000	like a few years ago
8285000	8287000	yeah it's just that they've
8287000	8289000	changed so many things since then
8289000	8291000	you gotta stay on top of that stuff
8291000	8293000	it's outdone before you even
8293000	8295000	know it so anyway
8295000	8297000	big big thank you for that
8297000	8299000	and yeah Bobby agrees it was worth
8299000	8301000	breaking the rules for and I'm
8301000	8303000	okay with that I really really am
8303000	8305000	yeah I can post a link there's
8305000	8307000	a way back oh is there is on the way back
8307000	8309000	machine yeah sweet post that in chat
8309000	8311000	that's awesome I love that
8311000	8313000	anyway we are I did not get the
8313000	8315000	studio on the freaking discord server actually
8315000	8317000	before I take calls we do have at least
8317000	8319000	one person in the green room did you want to
8319000	8321000	do any last minute stories I know I had
8321000	8323000	to cut sure I can talk about
8323000	8325000	there do you like one story then we get to you remember
8325000	8327000	that we talked a little bit about the overwatch
8327000	8329000	kind of
8329000	8331000	was it the
8331000	8333000	thing that they were doing for the the mods
8333000	8335000	and stuff like that so someone actually
8335000	8337000	created of course a portal gun in there
8337000	8339000	so now you can have your portal fun along
8339000	8341000	with the
8341000	8343000	as one of the game types in overwatch
8343000	8345000	now so that's kind of neat that they have that
8345000	8347000	that's cool I forgot to mention during my gaming week I actually
8347000	8349000	played overwatch which I haven't played in a while but I was
8349000	8351000	like oh shit that special event is
8351000	8353000	about to run out and I haven't even done it yet so I
8353000	8355000	went in and I did like the story mode and the use
8355000	8357000	any hero mode and all that
8357000	8359000	and the opening movie is kind of
8359000	8361000	long this time but it's well done
8361000	8363000	it's good I just wish like
8363000	8365000	there's seriously only one character
8365000	8367000	in the story mode version that I can play
8367000	8369000	half decently and that's mercy
8369000	8371000	I guess if if I was forced to
8371000	8373000	I could kind of do Winston but I am
8373000	8375000	terrible with Genji and Tracer
8375000	8377000	terrible so but I mean
8377000	8379000	I think it's cool that that's okay I'm terrible at the entire
8379000	8381000	game
8381000	8383000	that's fair
8383000	8385000	let me
8385000	8387000	answer that since you can ask questions in
8387000	8389000	chat as well and then we'll get to a call here
8389000	8391000	schmaketastic wants to know is Loki
8391000	8393000	still doing any game coding last
8393000	8395000	I heard he was messing around with C++ or
8395000	8397000	something it's been a few months since I've tuned in
8397000	8399000	well let me tell you
8399000	8401000	so I guess some good notes
8401000	8403000	the kid has written more games
8403000	8405000	at this point than Loki has
8405000	8407000	the kid
8407000	8409000	the kid is doing coding actually
8409000	8411000	which is pretty amazing and I
8411000	8413000	hope at some point he'll have a game that
8413000	8415000	we want to say hey y'all should go check
8415000	8417000	this out we made a game
8417000	8419000	about John Cena memes it was pretty awesome
8419000	8421000	he's kind of gotten done with doing John Cena
8421000	8423000	stuff in fact that's actually it's funny
8423000	8425000	like we were no we had that
8425000	8427000	conversation the other day about like
8427000	8429000	um
8429000	8431000	because the owner of the I always talk to the owner
8431000	8433000	of the place when I'm there
8433000	8435000	and he's like yeah I've noticed that he's
8435000	8437000	stopped putting John Cena in every single
8437000	8439000	one of his games that he submits
8439000	8441000	so
8441000	8443000	so he's doing like no he
8443000	8445000	he finished one now it's it
8445000	8447000	was called Dragon Racing so they had
8447000	8449000	the like you have the race dragon
8449000	8451000	around like a little track thing
8451000	8453000	he has to do one now it's called
8453000	8455000	uh because Ninja
8455000	8457000	Invaders it's basically he has to create
8457000	8459000	a ninja character that
8459000	8461000	move you move and avoid
8461000	8463000	like stuff coming towards it kind of like
8463000	8465000	a space shooter avoid object
8465000	8467000	thing so he has to work on that
8467000	8469000	so he's got about like he's about halfway
8469000	8471000	through the white belt course and then
8471000	8473000	he's gonna go through that he has to do
8473000	8475000	some robotic stuff and then there's some they
8475000	8477000	call improve yourselves which is basically
8477000	8479000	here's a challenge but we're not gonna tell you how to do
8479000	8481000	it you have to do it based on all of the
8481000	8483000	knowledge that you have and it's kind of like a test
8483000	8485000	and once he does that then he moves
8485000	8487000	to yellow belt which is
8487000	8489000	then um JavaScript
8489000	8491000	so he's gonna start getting in JavaScript and
8491000	8493000	you guys have to remember because if you haven't listened
8493000	8495000	in a while you might not recall Loki's
8495000	8497000	kid is eight yeah eight years old
8497000	8499000	and this this is what they're doing now
8499000	8501000	when I was eight years old we
8501000	8503000	were plunking around on an Apple 2e doing
8503000	8505000	logo not the television
8505000	8507000	network the pen
8507000	8509000	down forward 30
8509000	8511000	pen up when I
8511000	8513000	was eight years old I was learning French
8513000	8515000	if I
8515000	8517000	look if I look here I probably
8517000	8519000	could post a couple of his games in chat because
8519000	8521000	I get linked on them every single time
8521000	8523000	that he uh he goes
8523000	8525000	in there I just they go into that parent portal and
8525000	8527000	I can show you some of the stuff he's been
8527000	8529000	working on
8529000	8531000	but it's cool it's
8531000	8533000	not not to make fun of him or anything
8533000	8535000	a lot of it's very obnoxious
8535000	8537000	it's a kid usually when we like
8537000	8539000	laugh at that stuff it's like oh my gosh I can't believe
8539000	8541000	what kids are doing I can't believe like what kids
8541000	8543000	like are are into but as far as
8543000	8545000	your own personal coding
8545000	8547000	uh you have he has yet to release
8547000	8549000	anything that uh is
8549000	8551000	is I did see the time to car
8551000	8553000	thing I did get to see that at one point
8553000	8555000	it's on YouTube oh yeah that's right you did put it
8555000	8557000	on YouTube it's on it's on my YouTube channel
8557000	8559000	uh YouTube Lokiolar
8559000	8561000	you can check it out it's really old the reason
8561000	8563000	I didn't release it because it wasn't fun
8563000	8565000	and I had I would have had to I wanted
8565000	8567000	to redo the whole thing
8567000	8569000	I just it kind of got like
8569000	8571000	it I lost the scope of what I was trying
8571000	8573000	to do with it and then
8573000	8575000	it just became too weird and
8575000	8577000	so I decided to um
8577000	8579000	I'm not gonna work on it until I have a clear idea
8579000	8581000	of what I'm gonna do so
8581000	8583000	I'm working on something else right now instead
8583000	8585000	all right well let's get to

8613000	8615000	kind of sort of touched it on
8615000	8617000	briefly in passing now
8617000	8619000	a short while ago I thought I'd
8619000	8621000	call about arcade 1-up
8621000	8623000	um now
8623000	8625000	you know I haven't
8625000	8627000	seen these machines in person
8627000	8629000	myself but obviously
8629000	8631000	you and Loki and
8631000	8633000	uh Dark Soccer have so
8633000	8635000	um
8635000	8637000	my question is
8637000	8639000	for a little
8639000	8641000	exposition obviously I know they're gonna
8641000	8643000	be a little bit different than the
8643000	8645000	actual arcade originals
8645000	8647000	they're gonna be smaller chances are they
8647000	8649000	don't accept quarters
8649000	8651000	or tokens or anything like that
8651000	8653000	but even with that being said
8653000	8655000	now if you're
8655000	8657000	not in the position to get
8657000	8659000	the actual arcade machine for
8659000	8661000	one ever reason
8661000	8663000	you know would you recommend
8663000	8665000	you know people go out and get
8665000	8667000	these machines is like uh
8667000	8669000	alternative to the original machine
8669000	8671000	um
8671000	8673000	as an alternative to the original machine
8673000	8675000	it depends if you're a collector
8675000	8677000	I don't think anything's gonna replace the
8677000	8679000	original machine as far as like collector
8679000	8681000	value and goes but if you're just somebody
8681000	8683000	like looking to enhance your game
8683000	8685000	room or your fun space
8685000	8687000	like a like especially like maybe if you have
8687000	8689000	like a community game room if you have like a
8689000	8691000	HOA or an apartment complex or something has like
8691000	8693000	a standard game room and you're looking to like
8693000	8695000	enrich that a little bit I think one of these machines would be
8695000	8697000	really like an adorable way to do that now
8697000	8699000	since you haven't seen them in person but by the way
8699000	8701000	my well at least a local
8701000	8703000	Walmart to here has them on
8703000	8705000	display now I don't think that means
8705000	8707000	every Walmart has them on display
8707000	8709000	but I know one near here does so if you
8709000	8711000	have a large Walmart near to you somewhere
8711000	8713000	um you might be able to go and
8713000	8715000	uh see that so I
8715000	8717000	check that out and also um Costco
8717000	8719000	here sells them now I don't have
8719000	8721000	a Costco membership but somebody sent me
8721000	8723000	a text the other day going hey I thought
8723000	8725000	of you because I saw this at Costco so I know
8725000	8727000	they're selling them there too is Costco nationwide
8727000	8729000	nationwide or is that just west coast
8729000	8731000	they're nationwide okay they're nationwide so
8731000	8733000	check that too um
8733000	8735000	so you may be able to see one in person
8735000	8737000	if you if you head to one of those stores I imagine
8737000	8739000	they're going to be showing up more places soon
8739000	8741000	because there's really no describing it like seeing
8741000	8743000	one in person although you could probably see some YouTubes
8743000	8745000	and they probably do a good job at explaining
8745000	8747000	it as well um they are
8747000	8749000	smaller they're not like the original cabinet
8749000	8751000	um because I would say imagine
8751000	8753000	more like a bar top if you've ever been to
8753000	8755000	a bar and you see something that's like kind of like
8755000	8757000	sitting on top of the bar it's kind of more like
8757000	8759000	that but it's probably like
8759000	8761000	I would say it has a little more height to
8761000	8763000	it it kind of goes up a little bit it's a little more
8763000	8765000	skinnier like an arcade cabinet but it goes
8765000	8767000	up a little bit and then um you know it's
8767000	8769000	just not the size of a full size it's
8769000	8771000	meant to be put like on the bar
8771000	8773000	and then you sit there on a stool and play
8773000	8775000	the game that way it's not meant to be something you put on
8775000	8777000	the ground because if you put it on the ground it wouldn't
8777000	8779000	come up past your kneecaps okay
8779000	8781000	whereas the original arcade machine would come
8781000	8783000	up the full size um
8783000	8785000	the thing I noticed right off the bat
8785000	8787000	as being very different is the monitor
8787000	8789000	because they have a very kind of like
8789000	8791000	cheap but modern monitor
8791000	8793000	in there and I think one thing you have to remember
8793000	8795000	is that a lot of these games like Mortal
8795000	8797000	Combat like I don't know what are even
8797000	8799000	in these things Crystal Castles
8799000	8801000	like old school Asteroids, Tempest
8801000	8803000	those type of games they all played on
8803000	8805000	CRT televisions and that's not
8805000	8807000	what's powering these things these are like
8807000	8809000	flat screen TVs in those so
8809000	8811000	that's the first thing I noticed
8811000	8813000	that's different is that oh this looks
8813000	8815000	different because it's not like a CRT
8815000	8817000	which is a very kind of distinct look to
8817000	8819000	it versus you know a more modern
8819000	8821000	flat screen television so I think
8821000	8823000	for me right there that's like the biggest
8823000	8825000	difference you're going to notice but that's also
8825000	8827000	how they make these things not cost
8827000	8829000	a couple thousand dollars which
8829000	8831000	if you're a collector trying to collect a machine
8831000	8833000	I don't know Jamie you may know
8833000	8835000	more about this than I do I know you guys collect pinball
8835000	8837000	machines and not arcade machines but
8837000	8839000	do you have any idea like ballpark what an
8839000	8841000	80's arcade machine might cost somebody?
8841000	8843000	Depends on the machine I mean really
8843000	8845000	because it depends on rarity it depends
8845000	8847000	on if it is a mod
8847000	8849000	a lot of machines were modded and people
8849000	8851000	will buy the modded machines and try to
8851000	8853000	restore them back to original
8853000	8855000	when we picked up our pole position
8855000	8857000	now it was in shitty condition
8857000	8859000	but we picked up our pole position
8859000	8861000	for I want to say 200
8861000	8863000	that's not bad
8863000	8865000	yeah it was pretty crappy
8865000	8867000	I remember Shermie lived in it for a
8867000	8869000	little while remember yeah I do
8869000	8871000	I do and you guys put a main thing
8871000	8873000	in that right we did we did
8873000	8875000	we also now
8875000	8877000	keep in mind our gyrus was free
8877000	8879000	because it needed
8879000	8881000	a fuse replaced and the owner didn't want to do
8881000	8883000	it or you didn't know how to fix it
8883000	8885000	we got our blastroids
8885000	8887000	I want to say for 50 I mean
8887000	8889000	we've since sold both of these now
8889000	8891000	I think for 500 for the pair
8891000	8893000	because we needed room
8893000	8895000	but
8895000	8897000	I mean it just really depends
8897000	8899000	a good way actually
8899000	8901000	to learn some of these prices is a channel
8901000	8903000	that Dan and I watch is TNT Amusements
8903000	8905000	out on the East Coast
8905000	8907000	I'm trying to remember where exactly
8907000	8909000	but you know he'll go through
8909000	8911000	and he'll say what the prices you know they show some
8911000	8913000	of the repair process on some of the machines
8913000	8915000	and they talk about the pricing
8915000	8917000	and you know what a discounted price
8917000	8919000	would be and what he picks
8919000	8921000	up these things for and the work that goes into him
8921000	8923000	I get a really good
8923000	8925000	gauge just watching his YouTube
8925000	8927000	channel so
8927000	8929000	now I do want to respond
8929000	8931000	because I'm finally looking at chat and some of the
8931000	8933000	input you guys are making there first off
8933000	8935000	Costco is apparently not just nationwide
8935000	8937000	but it's in Mexico too according to Act F so it's
8937000	8939000	international so I really don't know what I'm talking about
8939000	8941000	and then
8941000	8943000	let's see S2100 Matt I thought had some good advice
8943000	8945000	here your best bet for getting machines
8945000	8947000	at a good price look for
8947000	8949000	auctions sometimes you'll get
8949000	8951000	a good deal I remember YYR
8951000	8953000	got his DDR machine for a good price
8953000	8955000	at an auction so that's
8955000	8957000	that's a good way to think about it too not that
8957000	8959000	I'm saying you're running out there to collect arcade machines
8959000	8961000	Metal Mayhem but you never you never know
8961000	8963000	especially sometimes it's just about
8963000	8965000	like who you know and what have you
8965000	8967000	just like Dark Tips
8967000	8969000	I'm sorry I'm looking for chat while I'm talking
8969000	8971000	Dark Sakura
8971000	8973000	I'm looking at chat while I'm
8973000	8975000	Dark Sakura mentioned
8975000	8977000	that they got a free one just because
8977000	8979000	you know lazy owner space
8979000	8981000	as far as the owner was concerned you'd be surprised
8981000	8983000	where you can find stuff I found my DDR
8983000	8985000	cabinet on Facebook marketplace
8985000	8987000	so yeah wow I got a great
8987000	8989000	deal on that
8989000	8991000	it's crazy
8991000	8993000	I did a little bit of
8993000	8995000	basic research for actual
8995000	8997000	arcade machines being
8997000	8999000	sold in my area
8999000	9001000	for those that don't remember
9001000	9003000	or are relatively new to the show
9003000	9005000	I live in the western New
9005000	9007000	York area
9007000	9009000	and you know
9009000	9011000	the cities in western
9011000	9013000	New York are nowhere as big as Sacramento
9013000	9015000	or LA or anything like that
9015000	9017000	so
9017000	9019000	my choices for
9019000	9021000	places that sell
9021000	9023000	are rather limited
9023000	9025000	and now the ones that I constantly
9025000	9027000	see being advertised
9027000	9029000	they have been restored and whatnot
9029000	9031000	typically regardless
9031000	9033000	of the machine
9033000	9035000	they're being sold for roughly two and a half
9035000	9037000	grand
9037000	9039000	as much as I would like an
9039000	9041000	actual
9041000	9043000	same working order and all that
9043000	9045000	two and a half bands way
9045000	9047000	out of my price range
9047000	9049000	so I kind of figure
9049000	9051000	if I can't do two and a half grand
9053000	9055000	if I remember right you said these
9055000	9057000	arcade one ups
9057000	9059000	are being sold for roughly
9059000	9061000	about two hundred dollars right?
9061000	9063000	I can't figure
9063000	9065000	two hundred dollars is still a little bit of a stretch
9065000	9067000	about two hundred dollars
9067000	9069000	is still
9069000	9071000	way more affordable
9071000	9073000	it's doable
9073000	9075000	it's about the same price
9075000	9077000	what a console would cost you
9077000	9079000	you're only going to get a handful of games
9079000	9081000	so they have to be games that really mean something to you
9081000	9083000	but it could be worth it
9083000	9085000	yeah
9085000	9087000	if I like
9087000	9089000	if I really
9089000	9091000	go
9091000	9093000	and save up
9093000	9095000	like living on nothing
9095000	9097000	but ramen and
9097000	9099000	air and water for like
9099000	9101000	years then maybe just
9101000	9103000	maybe with a little
9103000	9105000	luck maybe I can
9105000	9107000	pass away for the actual arcade machine
9107000	9109000	at like two and a half grand but
9109000	9111000	I wouldn't hold my breath on that
9111000	9113000	I don't think any
9113000	9115000	arcade machine is worth starving yourself
9115000	9117000	for but you know if you
9117000	9119000	you find things in your budget
9119000	9121000	to cut back on you'd be surprised
9121000	9123000	how long am I to err how
9123000	9125000	not so long am I taking to save for some things
9125000	9127000	you know what I mean
9127000	9129000	I mean you know the computer that I'm on
9129000	9131000	right now you know that was
9131000	9133000	relatively cheap but I literally
9133000	9135000	had to live on like a shoe sticking out
9135000	9137000	budget for like three months
9137000	9139000	to get to get the money for that and that was
9139000	9141000	only like roughly four hundred
9141000	9143000	fifty dollars so
9143000	9145000	yeah all right well
9145000	9147000	you know I took away too much of
9147000	9149000	the time so I'll clear up reliance for
9149000	9151000	somewhere else so you know I was calling
9151000	9153000	but thanks for taking my call don't worry
9153000	9155000	about it it was a good topic you take care okay
9155000	9157000	you too take care yep
9157000	9159000	all right so we are about
9159000	9161000	to get to our next call here
9161000	9163000	dar Tutsi agreeing in our chat yeah the one ups
9163000	9165000	might be good if you don't want to get your hands
9165000	9167000	dirty with repairs
9167000	9169000	all right well we're going to take another call here I see
9169000	9171000	another person in the green room so I'm going to bring him into
9171000	9173000	the on air channel and say
9173000	9175000	hello you're on orange launch radio who's this
9175000	9177000	hey it's make tastic
9177000	9179000	hey hi there
9179000	9181000	you're the one that just sent that very
9181000	9183000	kind donation thank you so much how can
9183000	9185000	how can I not take your call tonight
9185000	9187000	how are you oh it's no worries
9187000	9189000	I'm doing great little under the weather but
9189000	9191000	yikes yeah
9191000	9193000	just I don't have anything
9193000	9195000	relevant topic wise to say but
9195000	9197000	just wanted to say you know I've been listening since I
9197000	9199000	was 15 back when RSS feeds
9199000	9201000	on the PSP were still a thing
9201000	9203000	I'm 28 now so
9203000	9205000	that kind of dates me a little bit there but
9205000	9207000	uh I think my first memory
9207000	9209000	of you all was uh when you weren't
9209000	9211000	mentioning how long you all have been on the air
9211000	9213000	or a podcast rather
9213000	9215000	and dark soccer held up her fingers and said
9215000	9217000	we're this many and you were all like oh
9217000	9219000	yeah great radio dark soccer
9219000	9221000	they're holding up your fingers
9221000	9223000	isn't isn't that ironic
9223000	9225000	now that we're on twitch so
9225000	9227000	dark soccer hold up how many fingers
9227000	9229000	with how old the show is
9229000	9231000	they can't see they can't see that no
9231000	9233000	we're more than one dark
9233000	9235000	multiply that by 17
9235000	9237000	all right
9237000	9239000	noted noted yeah
9239000	9241000	with love with love
9241000	9243000	I've called in and emailed
9243000	9245000	in under several different aliases
9245000	9247000	could never really stick to one so
9247000	9249000	this is one I actually can stick to
9249000	9251000	because I've had it since I was a teenager
9251000	9253000	but um yeah I mean
9253000	9255000	I've called I remember emailing in
9255000	9257000	one day when I was a teen and
9257000	9259000	real lonely angsty teen and how I
9259000	9261000	sent in an email stating how the show really
9261000	9263000	got me through the day when my dog died
9263000	9265000	stuff like that
9265000	9267000	I just uh
9267000	9269000	I just want to thank you all for uh
9269000	9271000	keeping at it for
9271000	9273000	this long too that's just
9273000	9275000	kind of unprecedented I mean
9275000	9277000	I kind of I kind of joke
9277000	9279000	about this sometimes but the story that
9279000	9281000	you kind of gave there is that like I've been
9281000	9283000	listening since I was 15 and now I'm 28
9283000	9285000	you know it's it's it's
9285000	9287000	like the best thing to hear at the same
9287000	9289000	time being the worst thing to hear
9289000	9291000	right yeah it's kind of uh
9291000	9293000	no but I love it I love
9293000	9295000	no I do I do like but the
9295000	9297000	fact that uh we just make fun of
9297000	9299000	it because it's obviously a reminder of like oh
9299000	9301000	yeah I was 24 when I started this and now
9301000	9303000	I'm um not
9303000	9305000	um but uh don't even
9305000	9307000	the the fact that
9307000	9309000	many of you have stuck with this as long
9309000	9311000	as you have I mean it's it's the reason
9311000	9313000	why we keep showing up on Sunday night you know
9313000	9315000	we're not we're not a huge show
9315000	9317000	we don't we don't got the ratings a giant
9317000	9319000	bomb or um I don't
9319000	9321000	what are even the big gaming podcast I don't even
9321000	9323000	know anymore a lot of them just kind of come
9323000	9325000	and go but anyway
9325000	9327000	because y'all are technically
9327000	9329000	first podcast I ever
9329000	9331000	listened to so I don't want to say
9331000	9333000	anything even remotely shady about gamertag
9333000	9335000	though because Danny was very hard at what he
9335000	9337000	does and deserves the success that
9337000	9339000	he's getting and he's another indie guy so like
9339000	9341000	I can't I can't shade or hate
9341000	9343000	on that in any single way uh
9343000	9345000	but I will always throw shade at the corporate people involved
9345000	9347000	um so uh
9347000	9349000	yeah but um gosh thank you
9349000	9351000	thank you so much for um just
9351000	9353000	being here and and uh
9353000	9355000	being with us and giving us the motivation
9355000	9357000	to show up like people people
9357000	9359000	often ask us like how do you keep
9359000	9361000	going for 17 years
9361000	9363000	and there's several different
9363000	9365000	well I mean you say
9365000	9367000	that well you say that tongue in cheek
9367000	9369000	but there's definitely a part of me that goes
9369000	9371000	like the Sunday nights when
9371000	9373000	OLR isn't here
9373000	9375000	when something pre-planned isn't
9375000	9377000	going on like um let's say like we had a show
9377000	9379000	cut out because of a technical issue or something like
9379000	9381000	I I really didn't want to take the show off but we had like a
9381000	9383000	technical issue or something um
9383000	9385000	and it just feels weird
9385000	9387000	I'm like sitting there going what do I do
9387000	9389000	I guess I'll watch Game of Thrones or something
9389000	9391000	no I'm not even that bored so you know
9391000	9393000	it's like I don't know what to do um
9393000	9395000	but just also the fact that there's so many
9395000	9397000	of you out there
9397000	9399000	and I say so many and again it's not
9399000	9401000	like thousands and thousands
9401000	9403000	it's maybe dozens and dozens
9403000	9405000	but that's still something to me
9405000	9407000	the fact that even one person
9407000	9409000	would like turn up and like
9409000	9411000	give a shit about our discussions
9411000	9413000	that we're having here and our stories
9413000	9415000	and our angles and things like that like that's just like
9415000	9417000	that's all the motivation in the world
9417000	9419000	and that's something that's kept this show being fed
9419000	9421000	for 17 years and we'll
9421000	9423000	keep the show being fed until
9423000	9425000	one day we just have
9425000	9427000	to pull the plug for whatever reason
9427000	9429000	whatever that reason may be that I don't want to think of yet
9429000	9431000	right you know I've dropped
9431000	9433000	in and out of several different podcasts
9433000	9435000	but this has been the one that I've
9435000	9437000	stuck with for 12 years now
9437000	9439000	I mean granted I'm never as
9439000	9441000	consistent as I would like to be
9441000	9443000	but you know
9443000	9445000	y'all have been my
9445000	9447000	getting me through
9447000	9449000	you know to my commute to work
9449000	9451000	and my commute home from where
9451000	9453000	you know just always
9453000	9455000	hearing your voices is a good thing
9455000	9457000	and you guys really put on a great show
9457000	9459000	and I just wanted to extend my gratitude
9459000	9461000	well thank you so so much it's like
9461000	9463000	super appreciated and you know
9463000	9465000	I really do appreciate that thank you
9465000	9467000	yeah if you can't listen every week it's like totally
9467000	9469000	okay like you know some people will say like
9469000	9471000	oh man I haven't been able to listen to
9471000	9473000	OLR in like three months and I'm like
9473000	9475000	it's cool like it really is
9475000	9477000	like don't feel like you owe me an
9477000	9479000	apology or something I'm here doing my
9479000	9481000	thing with with our soccer and Loki
9481000	9483000	and if you're able to make it out cool
9483000	9485000	if not hey it happens
9485000	9487000	but as I usually say at the end
9487000	9489000	of the show and I'll just kind of remind everybody of it now
9489000	9491000	if if OLR you decide one day it's
9491000	9493000	not really for you anymore for whatever reason I just
9493000	9495000	hope you support independent podcasts
9495000	9497000	and please please
9497000	9499000	please do not support celebrity
9499000	9501000	podcasts that want to charge you
9501000	9503000	$7.99 a month for the privilege
9503000	9505000	of being able to listen to it
9505000	9507000	that's all I'm going to say for the record
9507000	9509000	if you do decide the podcast is no longer
9509000	9511000	for you would like to know why
9511000	9513000	honestly enough because
9513000	9515000	I'm a firm believer that a complaint is a gift
9515000	9517000	and if you
9517000	9519000	have a problem with something that we do or say
9519000	9521000	it'd be better to tell us right off the bat
9521000	9523000	hopefully you know where we can discuss
9523000	9525000	it so that you know
9525000	9527000	we know what people
9527000	9529000	aren't liking but to be clear
9529000	9531000	because I have read some of those like iTunes reviews
9531000	9533000	and things like that those don't count yeah things like
9533000	9535000	Dark Soccer is a bitch
9535000	9537000	or have there been more of those
9537000	9539000	Rob not in years or
9539000	9541000	Rob is annoying or whatever
9541000	9543000	Loki is too loud or
9543000	9545000	you play too much Pokemon Go like those things
9545000	9547000	aren't going to help you know what I mean
9547000	9549000	whatever yeah not very
9549000	9551000	constructive criticism but it's
9551000	9553000	also glad to hear that Dark Soccer is still
9553000	9555000	playing Animal Crossing
9555000	9557000	I'd like to think that Loki is still modding
9557000	9559000	the shit out of GTA 5 or something
9559000	9561000	um something
9561000	9563000	I love my Animal Crossing
9563000	9565000	though I'm so waiting for the Switch one
9565000	9567000	right
9567000	9569000	well uh that's really all I wanted to say guys
9569000	9571000	so just keep kicking ass
9597000	9599000	you're not already a hologram?
9599000	9601000	alright I'll show you hologram
9601000	9603000	take care shmaktastic thanks for being here
9603000	9605000	later
9605000	9607000	that was great
9607000	9609000	alright I think we'll end on that note
9609000	9611000	we're going to end on a happy note tonight
9611000	9613000	although I will ask Loki if there's any other
9613000	9615000	last minute stories he wants to see tonight
9615000	9617000	nah I've been just watching videos of this
9617000	9619000	of Dreams
9619000	9621000	the medium molecules posting
9621000	9623000	little big planet but PS4
9623000	9625000	yeah the stuff that people are doing in like the
9625000	9627000	past right now this game is going to
9627000	9629000	catch a lot of people off guard it looks
9629000	9631000	amazing I can't wait to play it but I feel
9631000	9633000	like this they're not really
9633000	9635000	explaining like when the game comes out I
9635000	9637000	feel like it's like this secret thing
9637000	9639000	that like you have to be part of the cool kids club to
9639000	9641000	know like when when when can I walk
9641000	9643000	into a target and buy
9643000	9645000	the fucking game that's what I would like to
9645000	9647000	know I don't know but it looks
9647000	9649000	it looks awesome yeah it does look
9649000	9651000	awesome like I'm all here for it but like
9651000	9653000	you know let me buy your game
9653000	9655000	that's all I'm asking I'm sure we'll
9655000	9657000	see it at E3 well maybe
9657000	9659000	cause Sony's not there
9659000	9661000	so they might put something out
9661000	9663000	they can just show this for the whole presentation
9663000	9665000	alongside it I don't know they might do a
9665000	9667000	direct-ish style thing
9667000	9669000	I don't know we'll see anyway
9669000	9671000	that does bring us to the end of another
9671000	9673000	episode of Orange Lawn Radio but we want to thank you
9673000	9675000	guys for being here tonight and
9675000	9677000	thank you for listening to our show and
9677000	9679000	as we were saying there on that call if you enjoyed
9679000	9681000	the show you know
9681000	9683000	well actually I said if you don't enjoy the show what to do
9683000	9685000	but if you do enjoy the show please
9685000	9687000	tell a friend help us spread the word because we are the
9687000	9689000	show where every gamer has a voice but if the voices
9689000	9691000	aren't here we can't air them
9691000	9693000	auto hosts on Twitch
9693000	9695000	TV for VoG network go a long
9695000	9697000	way we super appreciate those
9697000	9699000	if you consider adding VoG network to your auto host list
9699000	9701000	a nice five star review wherever
9701000	9703000	you found this show whether it be
9703000	9705000	iTunes or Google podcast or wherever
9705000	9707000	all of those really really go
9707000	9709000	a long way and we super appreciate it
9709000	9711000	I guess that's all we
9711000	9713000	have to say on that end so let's go around and get everybody's
9713000	9715000	final thought
9715000	9717000	DarkSakura why don't we start with you your final thought tonight
9719000	9721000	I don't think I
9721000	9723000	have one just people need to learn that
9723000	9725000	communication is very important that's all
9725000	9727000	and Loki your final
9727000	9729000	thought my final thought
9729000	9731000	is I'm going to try to stream something
9731000	9733000	this week because I've got a lot of opportunity to do that
9733000	9735000	so we'll see
9735000	9737000	and my final thought tonight is
9737000	9739000	I don't have a lot to say
9739000	9741000	I'm grateful we have
9741000	9743000	new microphones there's hopefully we all
9743000	9745000	sounded good tonight and that
9745000	9747000	that was a worthy investment and
9747000	9749000	thank you all for being here I think that
9749000	9751000	last call just really summed it up perfectly
9751000	9753000	it was a very feel good fuzzy way to end the
9753000	9755000	show tonight thank you guys so much for being here and being

9765000	9767000	about in the early days of O.L.R. we're not going to get
