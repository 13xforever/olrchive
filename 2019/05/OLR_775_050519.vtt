Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

00:14.000 --> 00:18.000
This week, Microsoft defines some tolerable speech and MOBAs punish intolerable cheaters.

00:18.000 --> 00:22.000
If social issues are getting to be too much, why not use your Nintendo Switch to write a program instead?

00:22.000 --> 00:28.000
These are just some of the stories we'll discuss tonight, starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:28.000 --> 00:33.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:33.000 --> 00:38.000
Hello, my friends out there on the internet. Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:38.000 --> 00:47.000
It is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight with episode number 775 for this May the 5th of 2019.

00:47.000 --> 00:53.000
My name is Rob Roberts joining studio by the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

00:53.000 --> 00:55.000
Well, you're going to have to do something special for 777.

00:55.000 --> 01:01.000
I know. Well, you know, there was a there was a Bomani song because our show is rooted in, you know, music gaming culture.

01:01.000 --> 01:06.000
There's a Bomani song called 777. And I think the plan was always, oh, we're just going to play that song.

01:06.000 --> 01:09.000
But now it's holy. Well, and now we can't.

01:09.000 --> 01:14.000
So we might have to like record ourselves playing it and guitar freaks somehow and then like play that.

01:14.000 --> 01:18.000
I don't know. I don't know what you do or we do a Vegas themed thing.

01:18.000 --> 01:21.000
I don't know. We make it extra sinful.

01:21.000 --> 01:25.000
Golden casino night. Hello, Techmaster Loki, by the way. Hello, I'm here.

01:25.000 --> 01:29.000
The classic game of the week is Vegas Stakes by who did that?

01:29.000 --> 01:34.000
Was that how for Super Nintendo? I think it was the people that went on to make Smash Brothers all those years later.

01:34.000 --> 01:38.000
So that should be another character like, you know, one of the slot machines,

01:38.000 --> 01:43.000
the Vegas dude, the girl that comes up to try to loan you money or try to convince you to loan her money.

01:43.000 --> 01:46.000
And sometimes they pay you back and sometimes they run away with it.

01:46.000 --> 01:50.000
We'll just fight the Vegas showgirl and proteus over and over and over and over.

01:50.000 --> 01:53.000
I hope people know what I'm talking about in that game, by the way.

01:53.000 --> 01:56.000
It was kind of a niche, like Super Nintendo game, but I thought it was awesome.

01:56.000 --> 01:59.000
Anyway. OK, good. I'm not alone.

01:59.000 --> 02:02.000
Looking in our chat room over at twitch.tv slash vog network,

02:02.000 --> 02:05.000
where we do tape live every Sunday night at the voice keeps network vog

02:05.000 --> 02:07.000
network dot com right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

02:07.000 --> 02:10.000
Six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern. OK, thank you.

02:10.000 --> 02:15.000
Vid Power says, yay, Vegas. I think that's just because the power is in Vegas.

02:15.000 --> 02:17.000
The break man, though, says, oh, shit, I love that game.

02:17.000 --> 02:21.000
And Bobby Blackwell says, I enjoyed Vegas Stakes. There you go.

02:21.000 --> 02:24.000
Hopefully, by the way, if you're listening to last week's show,

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
you might have heard that we had some live audio issues going on,

02:26.000 --> 02:29.000
which, you know, say lovey things are going to happen.

02:29.000 --> 02:32.000
That's the year that that's why you all turn out for a live show.

02:32.000 --> 02:36.000
And we put it out on the podcast feed warts and all the way that we recorded it.

02:36.000 --> 02:40.000
So we had some mic issues. So hopefully you guys are going to find that those are gone tonight

02:40.000 --> 02:44.000
because Dark Soccer and myself have some brand new microphones.

02:44.000 --> 02:48.000
So we went out on a shopping adventure earlier this week and picked up some microphones.

02:48.000 --> 02:50.000
They probably look different on stream as well.

02:50.000 --> 02:53.000
So, you know, the other ones that we had before, they were great.

02:53.000 --> 02:58.000
They were hand me downs, though, from pod culture, which, you know, of course, we super appreciate that.

02:58.000 --> 03:01.000
But the reality is he had already used them for some time. Then we use them.

03:01.000 --> 03:05.000
We used them up. I mean, gosh, we were in the apartment when we started using those.

03:05.000 --> 03:09.000
That was like five years ago. So I think those mics were just on their last legs,

03:09.000 --> 03:15.000
except Techmaster Loki still has the last of those microphones because these microphones,

03:15.000 --> 03:17.000
I guess these microphones are 100.

03:17.000 --> 03:19.000
They were worried I'm going to break them day one.

03:19.000 --> 03:22.000
These microphones are one hundred dollars a pop. So it was kind of.

03:22.000 --> 03:25.000
To be honest, not a lot in the scope of mics.

03:25.000 --> 03:30.000
Yeah, no, honestly, we we were looking at some, you know, pretty high end mics.

03:30.000 --> 03:33.000
So but these I think are going to work for what we're going to do.

03:33.000 --> 03:37.000
And it was just one of those. All right. Well, maybe we can spend two hundred dollars, but three.

03:37.000 --> 03:41.000
Let's just let's hold off. So we're going to make sure these are good.

03:41.000 --> 03:45.000
We don't have any problems. And then we'll upgrade. And I went lusting after other mics.

03:45.000 --> 03:52.000
Yeah, you were looking at the fancy like like Lana Del Rey singing a sultry song into an old fashioned radio type of mic.

03:52.000 --> 03:56.000
You're like, I want to just live stream with it. Well, that's actually kind of what I'm thinking of doing,

03:56.000 --> 04:01.000
because Dan and I have been working on the live stream set up, but my office is an absolute wreck.

04:01.000 --> 04:05.000
And that and I have plans to do a podcast.

04:05.000 --> 04:08.000
I'll just go ahead and say that plans to do a podcast as a sister.

04:08.000 --> 04:16.000
One of the sisters of perpetual indulgence to kind of expand the ministry and spread love and positivity in a very geeky, draggy kind of way.

04:16.000 --> 04:22.000
Love and positivity. This is gamer culture. Fuck that bitch. Get good.

04:22.000 --> 04:27.000
I'll show you good. I'll be so fucking good. I'm going to spread so much goddamn love.

04:27.000 --> 04:32.000
Fuck y'all. Love everybody. Damn it. Stop being a shit.

04:32.000 --> 04:36.000
That's going to be my podcast is like. All right.

04:36.000 --> 04:40.000
Let's get into things that gamers need to love a little bit. Maybe. I don't know.

04:40.000 --> 04:44.000
I want to start this week's show with our kickoff topic before we get into our gaming weeks.

04:44.000 --> 04:50.000
Always like to bring up one topic to kind of start us off tonight. And this is one I think a lot of people are talking about this week.

04:50.000 --> 04:56.000
Right. So the Sonic the Hedgehog movie trailer came out this week and it was everything we would hope that it would have been.

04:56.000 --> 05:02.000
It got a reaction. Well, I don't know. Loki like you didn't seem so bothered by it.

05:02.000 --> 05:07.000
Tell it. Oh, it was good. I knew it was going to be terrible. Yeah. And so all I cared about was Jim Carrey.

05:07.000 --> 05:13.000
Jim Carrey was awesome. I'm sold. I'll see it even if it's garbage.

05:13.000 --> 05:20.000
OK. For those that don't know, Loki's name does not come from Loki Marvel or like some of the other uses.

05:20.000 --> 05:25.000
It comes from Loki mask like the mask with Jim Carrey, which is is that still like your all time favorite movie, you'd say?

05:25.000 --> 05:32.000
Oh, no. I thought it was like one of your. I mean, it's cool. I like the movie, but it's it's old.

05:32.000 --> 05:39.000
But so, yeah. Well, and now when I watched the Sonic movie trailer, you know, I was kind of like, all right, this just looks like it's for kids.

05:39.000 --> 05:47.000
You know, whatever. Like and I think a really good comparison was made on Twitter for me that like especially when it comes to.

05:47.000 --> 05:51.000
I think the big thing y'all know we're going to talk about is the look of Sonic the Hedgehog. Right.

05:51.000 --> 05:59.000
So I'm not everybody took too well to the look. But, you know, I think the first thing I said on Twitter was, well, you know what?

05:59.000 --> 06:05.000
It doesn't mean this movie is going to tank just because all the video gamers that grew up with Sonic are on Twitter going, what the hell did they do to Sonic?

06:05.000 --> 06:10.000
Because I'm like, you know what? Like movies that we don't always understand why they're successful do very well.

06:10.000 --> 06:15.000
And I was like, they've made how many movies out of those minions, which I think those things are. I don't get it.

06:15.000 --> 06:17.000
I haven't seen a single one and they annoy me.

06:17.000 --> 06:23.000
Granted, yes, the minions are annoying, but the like the actual story in the writing is actually pretty decent.

06:23.000 --> 06:28.000
Like if you just have to like, I don't know, it's all about the 60s, the set pieces.

06:28.000 --> 06:40.000
Well, in a response I got and I think this is from Flocko, I think. Sorry if I'm misappropriating that comment, but I think the reply I got and I thought this was a better comparison is he said he brought up the Smurfs and the Alvin and the Chipmunk movies.

06:40.000 --> 06:50.000
And I was like, oh yeah, those Alvin and Chipmunks look terrible, but like they've made three of those movies, at least two, because one of them opened up against like a Marvel movie or something.

06:50.000 --> 07:00.000
Right. But they'll keep making them because it's just like, you know, they're probably cheap to produce and they make money.

07:00.000 --> 07:05.000
It's just like why there's really bad action movies out there too, because they're cheap to produce and they make money.

07:05.000 --> 07:15.000
But that doesn't mean you have to make it terribly. And I understand that like, just because we don't like the look of Sonic doesn't mean that, well, it's okay, we're not the target demographic.

07:15.000 --> 07:23.000
No, that would be the argument that the story that they are laying out here is kind of dumb and doesn't follow the game.

07:23.000 --> 07:29.000
That would be that kind of argument, but the fact that it looks weird is a problem.

07:30.000 --> 07:39.000
But it could be the fact that like, okay, if all these people that had a say on the creative direction of Sonic, if all these people were saying, this may not be a good idea.

07:39.000 --> 07:46.000
Does that leave concerns about maybe the script isn't a good idea? I don't know. I mean, we're all, a lot of us are making snap decisions based on the trailer.

07:46.000 --> 07:53.000
You know, we don't know what the movie story or anything's going to be. And I guess when I watched the trailer, I was like, oh, they're making another Jim Carrey movie from the 1990s.

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
And I'm down to bet.

07:56.000 --> 08:01.000
Actually, that's kind of awesome. I'm all for Jim Carrey having a 90s movie.

08:01.000 --> 08:13.000
I'm fine with it being a terrible movie, though. And let's be honest, there are some movies that have really good comedians in it, but they are probably pretty terrible.

08:13.000 --> 08:21.000
There was one, I don't even remember, I think there was another one with Jim Carrey, actually, with penguins or something like that, that there was something to that effect.

08:21.000 --> 08:26.000
I don't think I've seen that one. And then there was one I know, the Smurfs movies actually have Neil Patrick Harris.

08:26.000 --> 08:31.000
I'm like, I almost want to see it just because of that, but I never did see those.

08:31.000 --> 08:40.000
Looking in chat, DJ Rama S says, this movie may not be targeted at us, but for God's sake, Sonic should look damn near like his anime and gaming counterpart.

08:40.000 --> 08:44.000
Why not, though? Why not try to make it appeal to as many people as possible?

08:44.000 --> 08:51.000
That's just an excuse of saying, well, I'm sorry, we just didn't try that hard because we're only aiming at kids and kids don't give a shit.

08:51.000 --> 08:58.000
That's a terrible argument. That's just like, well, we wanted to pay the right, you know, that'd be like, imagine a Mario movie.

08:58.000 --> 09:10.000
OK, well, we can imagine a Mario movie that came out. Let's imagine a Mario movie outside of the 90s that came out where they're just like, eh, we don't fucking care because it's for kids, you know, and they just half-assed it.

09:10.000 --> 09:15.000
I will say this. There was a Super Mario Brothers anime that came out that was so freaking weird.

09:15.000 --> 09:21.000
Dan and I sat and watched it and it's like, why does this it had like nothing to do with any of the current canon.

09:21.000 --> 09:30.000
It was also weird, like having to rescue Peach's like boyfriend or something and weirdness. But weird Mario has been done before.

09:30.000 --> 09:33.000
And there is a Mario movie coming out, a new one.

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
Yeah, by Illumination.

09:35.000 --> 09:38.000
Honestly, by the Despicable Me people.

09:38.000 --> 09:43.000
I got to seriously, I know if they have Charles Martinet, you need to seriously sit down and watch those movies.

09:43.000 --> 09:48.000
They're not that bad. They're actually pretty entertaining to watch.

09:48.000 --> 09:58.000
So like I have no problem with them doing a Mario movie. I think they'd be a great studio to do Mario movie because like anything Illumination has done has actually been pretty good.

09:58.000 --> 10:05.000
Even like a dog's was a life of pets or something like that. That's actually a pretty decent movie.

10:05.000 --> 10:16.000
Well, let me bring it back because I think many of you, I'm sure many of you that bother to watch a Twitch gaming show probably keep some sort of pulse on the gaming news and so forth that's going out there on Twitter and so forth.

10:16.000 --> 10:29.000
So I think you all know kind of the punch line that ends this is that because of all of that kind of negative reception that ended up happening on social media, on Twitter and Facebook and everything and just the memes, the redoing of Sonic and so forth.

10:29.000 --> 10:38.000
The director of the movie, Jeff Fowler, who is foul town on Twitter. I actually think that's kind of a funny Twitter handle handle foul town over on Twitter said thank you for the sport and the criticism.

10:38.000 --> 10:48.000
The message is loud and clear. You aren't happy with the design and you want changes. It's going to happen. Everyone at Paramount and Sega are fully committed to making this character the best he can be.

10:48.000 --> 11:00.000
Hashtag Sonic movie, hashtag gotta fix fast, which I thought was funny. Now, I do want to say every other article you've seen about they have to go back and redo this before the release date.

11:00.000 --> 11:07.000
They have so much they're doing that. This is this this tweet, this 280 character tweet is what's been said on the subject.

11:07.000 --> 11:14.000
Every other story, every other click article you saw on Facebook, every other thing you read about how they have to go back and fix the Sonic movie.

11:14.000 --> 11:22.000
I'm using my little quotey fingers. Every single one of those articles is based on this 200 character tweet. So I mean we can sit here and read between the lines too.

11:22.000 --> 11:32.000
But we don't know yet if this means release date pushback. We're assuming no. We don't know if this means ironically following up on crunch time after last week's show.

11:32.000 --> 11:36.000
If this means it's going to be crunch time for animators and so forth. I hope not.

11:36.000 --> 11:45.000
It's probably it would be crunch time for rendering is what I would think. But they've they can still film their principal photography stuff and then add it in later.

11:45.000 --> 11:48.000
Principal photography has been done since like the end of 2008.

11:48.000 --> 11:53.000
So they're not 2008. I'm sorry 2018. I'm sorry.

11:53.000 --> 11:58.000
That's why we're getting 90s Jim Carrey. They filmed it in the 90s.

11:58.000 --> 12:02.000
They actually filmed it in the 90s. It's authentic.

12:02.000 --> 12:09.000
You know what I meant. I'm sorry. We couldn't we couldn't we couldn't realize Sonic until the technology was there.

12:09.000 --> 12:17.000
They filmed it last year and he made dinosaurs come to life with Sonic the Hedgehog was an additional challenge. Fuck off.

12:17.000 --> 12:23.000
All right. You all know what I meant anyway. So I mean the thing is principal photography is done.

12:23.000 --> 12:28.000
James Marsden. Jim Carrey. They've all moved on to other things. I don't know what they've moved on to these other things.

12:29.000 --> 12:32.000
So I don't think I mean it is customary to maybe do reshoots here and there.

12:32.000 --> 12:38.000
But at the same time if they're if they're fixing this rendering character that was not part of the principal photography now anyway.

12:38.000 --> 12:43.000
I mean it doesn't seem like they need to actually do reshoots but I'm not a Hollywood magician.

12:43.000 --> 12:49.000
Like who who likes. I want to know who okayed this. Who said. Yeah that's good.

12:49.000 --> 12:55.000
I mean like who. No one's like that doesn't really look like it should.

12:56.000 --> 13:03.000
Something's wrong. Focus groups focus groups. I know you're going to you're going to look at me and make fun of me because I'm saying that.

13:03.000 --> 13:09.000
No I understand. I'm just answering the question that's presented. Who told them they could do that. Focus groups did.

13:09.000 --> 13:19.000
I'm not saying these focus groups knew dick about Sonic the Hedgehog or anything but to be fair in Hollywood they're not necessarily wanting to just attract gamers.

13:19.000 --> 13:26.000
They want to build something that they can get all sorts of families on and that they can sell toys at the end of the day.

13:26.000 --> 13:34.000
But it isn't even about selling video games about selling toys. But why would making Sonic look more like the character from the game detract from Sonic.

13:34.000 --> 13:42.000
That's why I don't understand like why making it look accurate would detract from people wanting to see the movie.

13:42.000 --> 13:49.000
I don't ever. That's never been. Sorry. This was better. So that's why it did work. Like it doesn't make any sense. Here's the thing.

13:49.000 --> 13:59.000
Like I'm not I'm not going to like disagree that he looks bad. He didn't. He doesn't look great but I'm not sure what fixing him at this point is going to do like if the movie is bad.

13:59.000 --> 14:07.000
You guys it's going to be bad no matter what I want it to be if it's going to be bad. I want it to be really bad because I think Sonic as it is now.

14:07.000 --> 14:15.000
I think if we just kept everything as it is now with the potential to be like so bad it's good type category like I kind of want to go there.

14:15.000 --> 14:25.000
But now it's going to be like better and stuff and I guess that's fine. But Tiger Claw on chat says actually an article on I.G.M. back in December.

14:25.000 --> 14:32.000
The producer Tim Miller did say that Sega was not happy with the eyes but they went with what we saw because they didn't want Sonic to look like a Pixar character.

14:32.000 --> 14:37.000
Bobby Blackwell fired up in our chat saying the focus groups probably weren't given the game as a reference.

14:37.000 --> 14:44.000
Yeah I also would like to know why. Why was it such a big deal that oh damn we don't want our animation to look like this really.

14:44.000 --> 14:50.000
Well you know this highly esteemed animation company. God forbid we make it look good.

14:50.000 --> 14:58.000
I think there's a fear looking forward that then all the reviews would say that it's a Pixar knockoff or something which I'm not.

14:58.000 --> 15:06.000
Again Loki I'm just answering the I put out there I'm not saying I necessarily agree with these things but I that's probably why they did that.

15:06.000 --> 15:12.000
And but I think we all sit here and know but everybody knows Sonic the Hedgehog goes back before.

15:12.000 --> 15:16.000
Was Pixar a thing in ninety one. What was the first Toy Story movie. Ninety four.

15:16.000 --> 15:23.000
So some predates. We'll say Pixar's legacy. If nothing else we know that Sonic predates.

15:23.000 --> 15:34.000
It just sounds like it. It sounds like they just happened. I don't know. Here's the other some I am sure someone worked really hard on it but.

15:34.000 --> 15:40.000
Yeah. Here's other kind of just interesting things I want to put out there about this whole debacle.

15:40.000 --> 15:46.000
One of them is the fact that you know whether the news be good or whether the news be bad.

15:47.000 --> 15:51.000
I am hearing more about this movie than any other movie that's coming out.

15:51.000 --> 15:57.000
Oh that's because Detective Pikachu comes out this week and I'm sure it'll be just all how amazing that is.

15:57.000 --> 16:04.000
Somebody was trying to tell me like what movies were opening the same weekend as Sonic and they were like oh there's a sequel to The Shining coming out.

16:04.000 --> 16:07.000
There's some new Emmerich movie and I'm like I'm like they're making.

16:07.000 --> 16:10.000
Why. Who's first. Who's making a sequel to The Shining and why.

16:10.000 --> 16:19.000
The second like I'm just like I I'm not hearing about any of these other movies and I know you know but not nothing that's being said is any good.

16:19.000 --> 16:27.000
Since when was bad publicity. Now I roll it a roll in Emmerich Sonic movie I'm down at that.

16:27.000 --> 16:33.000
I was going to say a roll in Emmerich movie. I'm like you want to talk about a movie we know is going to be bad.

16:33.000 --> 16:40.000
Come on. Roll in Emmerich movies are like Independence Day. The day after tomorrow when they're running from temperature is that.

16:40.000 --> 16:44.000
Independence Day was good. Everything after Independence Day was bad.

16:44.000 --> 16:51.000
Independence Day is a perfect example a perfect example of a movie that's bad to the level that it's good.

16:51.000 --> 16:57.000
Yes yes there was a lot of like hold your disbelief type things like yes that's.

16:57.000 --> 17:02.000
Hold on to your butts. No wait that was the Jurassic Park but another movie that's kind of it's kind of bad but it's good.

17:02.000 --> 17:12.000
Oh no it's gone. Yeah Jurassic Park has gone that way too. But yeah I mean I remember I didn't watch the last one that he did but I watched 2012.

17:12.000 --> 17:18.000
And like there's only so many times that a plane can take off from a runway when the earthquake is destroying the road.

17:18.000 --> 17:22.000
It happened three fucking times in the movie three times.

17:22.000 --> 17:28.000
I kind of agree. Whereas I'm I'm appreciative of this director seems to be wanting to listen to the feedback and all that stuff.

17:28.000 --> 17:33.000
I kind of want to see what the Emmerich Sonic movie would look like.

17:33.000 --> 17:37.000
A character that can literally outrun temperature I think would be pretty amazing. All right.

17:37.000 --> 17:43.000
But anyway let's talk about that fan backlash a little bit because I'm also trying to sit here and think of a time.

17:43.000 --> 17:55.000
And I'm sure maybe chatters know because I can't think of any a time that a trailer was so poorly received that they went back and are changing the movie because of it.

17:56.000 --> 17:59.000
This is kind of a big deal.

17:59.000 --> 18:06.000
I'm not sure about a trailer but I know like several movies had like major reshoots like and never ended up working out too well either.

18:06.000 --> 18:11.000
Like what of the Wolverine movie. The original Wolverine movie.

18:11.000 --> 18:14.000
Good old test audiences seeing the original ending of things.

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
Little Shepherd Horrors.

18:17.000 --> 18:23.000
Because they had the original Plants When ending with the don't feed the plants that was in the stage play.

18:23.000 --> 18:28.000
And they went back and it tested so poorly that they went back and did a happy ending.

18:28.000 --> 18:34.000
But it's interesting that this is something that has become more and more prevalent in gamer culture.

18:34.000 --> 18:38.000
Like I know we're spending a lot of time talking about a movie that just happens to be based on a game.

18:38.000 --> 18:44.000
But let's be real. Fan backlashes. This is like the new norm in gaming culture.

18:44.000 --> 18:47.000
And I'm not completely sure how I feel about it.

18:47.000 --> 18:52.000
Obviously the most well known circumstance of this would be Mass Effect 3's original ending.

18:52.000 --> 18:55.000
And Jamie I know that's a game near and dear to your heart as well.

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
I liked the new endings.

18:57.000 --> 19:03.000
It's interesting because there's a part of me that's like let the art just be the art and let it be.

19:03.000 --> 19:08.000
And when I saw the original endings, because I did beat the game originally before the extended endings.

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
I was like it's not that bad.

19:10.000 --> 19:18.000
I understand why people were irritated because they felt that the decisions they made were not really reflected in the ending.

19:18.000 --> 19:23.000
But at the time I was kind of sitting there going well I feel like there's only so much you could do with it.

19:23.000 --> 19:26.000
So like you can't wrap up every single story.

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
Like there's just so many branching paths at this point.

19:28.000 --> 19:35.000
Like I don't know how else you would wrap it up besides an ending that spoiler alert for a video game that's very old at this point.

19:35.000 --> 19:41.000
Either destroys the entire universe or synthesizes or you know the various endings at the end of Mass Effect 3.

19:41.000 --> 19:47.000
So it's interesting they went back and did it but I'm kind of with you Jamie.

19:47.000 --> 19:53.000
After seeing what they did with those remade endings I was like oh well I like what they did with that.

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
I think these are even more impactful now.

19:55.000 --> 20:04.000
I know a lot of the hardcore fans hate the synthesis ending because of the unwillingness of merging the technology.

20:04.000 --> 20:09.000
However, you can hate that ending all you want. I would still argue it's very well done.

20:09.000 --> 20:13.000
Like just with Trisha Helfer's narration is amazing in that ending.

20:13.000 --> 20:16.000
I thought it was well done. It's just not the choice that I make.

20:16.000 --> 20:19.000
Sure, sure. You're allowed to have your head canon. That's part of the fun of Mass Effect, right?

20:20.000 --> 20:25.000
Honestly, the only one I choose is the one that has a chance of having my femme shut back.

20:25.000 --> 20:31.000
Yeah. So anyway, but I remember at the time that that all happened I was like, you know.

20:31.000 --> 20:37.000
The creators of Final Fantasy 7 should be so happy that the internet did not exist.

20:37.000 --> 20:41.000
I mean the internet was there but it was very dial up and prodigy AOL.

20:41.000 --> 20:45.000
It wasn't as prevalent in your pocket on your mobile phone as it is today.

20:45.000 --> 20:52.000
Like the creators of Final Fantasy 7 should be so happy that people were not able to make a fuss like they were back then.

20:52.000 --> 20:56.000
Which has me so curious how they're going to do this remake.

20:56.000 --> 21:02.000
Because I don't know if you guys all remember but the ending to Final Fantasy 7 is not great.

21:02.000 --> 21:09.000
Like it's not great. Especially considering all the effort you put into that game and everything.

21:09.000 --> 21:15.000
Like the ending, the payoff. I mean the story in that game doesn't make the most sense as it is.

21:15.000 --> 21:18.000
And the ending just kind of like further complicates that. You know what I mean?

21:18.000 --> 21:19.000
Yeah.

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
So it's going to be interesting to see how that all plays out.

21:21.000 --> 21:24.000
Do you think there will be a DLC remake or something? I don't know. A DLC ending?

21:24.000 --> 21:27.000
Anyway, going to chat for some more comments.

21:27.000 --> 21:31.000
Kaijuto says, like I said, gamers don't know what they want.

21:31.000 --> 21:36.000
They have to stop bending to everything gamers complain about and just think outside the box and create.

21:36.000 --> 21:41.000
SSJ100Matt talking about reshoots saying Back to the Future had to reshoot most of the movie.

21:41.000 --> 21:43.000
Because of Jason Bateman, wasn't it?

21:43.000 --> 21:46.000
It wasn't Jason Bateman. It was somebody else.

21:46.000 --> 21:49.000
I thought it was Jason Bateman.

21:49.000 --> 21:52.000
No, but it was someone along those lines. Like one of those.

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
Yeah, it was another 80's teen guy.

21:54.000 --> 21:57.000
But yeah, the original audiences didn't respond well.

21:57.000 --> 22:02.000
I thought they replaced him. I didn't think they shot the whole movie.

22:02.000 --> 22:06.000
They'd done some significant shooting but they hadn't shot the whole movie.

22:06.000 --> 22:07.000
Which movie?

22:07.000 --> 22:08.000
Back to the Future.

22:08.000 --> 22:09.000
Eric Stoltz.

22:09.000 --> 22:10.000
That's it.

22:10.000 --> 22:11.000
It was Eric Stoltz.

22:11.000 --> 22:12.000
Yes, that was it. Eric Stoltz.

22:12.000 --> 22:17.000
Because I kept seeing the movie he was in with Cher in my head and I was like, I know who it is, I know who it is.

22:17.000 --> 22:20.000
And Bobby clarifies it was two weeks, not the whole movie.

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
But still a pretty significant amount of time.

22:22.000 --> 22:29.000
Very infamously, Star Trek Voyager shot without Catherine Janeway.

22:29.000 --> 22:35.000
Without Kate Mulgrew. Well actually the character's original name I think was Nicole.

22:35.000 --> 22:41.000
I think even the captain had a different name. I think it was Nicole Janeway and it was that French actress Genevieve Bejold.

22:41.000 --> 22:47.000
And you can see some of her scenes on the Blu-ray because I've seen it and she's not great.

22:47.000 --> 22:49.000
Like you could kind of tell she didn't really want to be there.

22:49.000 --> 22:53.000
So I mean it kind of worked out because Kate Mulgrew is like legendary in that role.

22:53.000 --> 22:56.000
But that's a little different because audiences I don't think had as much to do with that.

22:56.000 --> 23:03.000
As maybe this is a circumstance where Hollywood and producers and things like that kind of sat in the boardroom and looked at it and made the right call.

23:03.000 --> 23:06.000
Like when they looked at that footage they said she is not right for this part.

23:06.000 --> 23:10.000
And got the person that they had second in mind, Columbo's wife.

23:10.000 --> 23:13.000
Which ended up being an epic Star Trek captain.

23:13.000 --> 23:20.000
So some other just quick reshoot things you may or may not have known about.

23:20.000 --> 23:25.000
Bobby Blackwell pointing out the Matrix Reloaded had to reshoot after Alia died.

23:25.000 --> 23:32.000
That's right. Alia was the role that was played by what's his name's daughter ended up doing it.

23:32.000 --> 23:36.000
I thought it was Jada Smith.

23:36.000 --> 23:40.000
No it wasn't that role. It was somebody famous' daughter that ended up doing it.

23:40.000 --> 23:45.000
You know the Matrix better. Who was Alia originally supposed to play in the Matrix Reloaded?

23:45.000 --> 23:48.000
It was not Jada Pinkett's character. It was somebody else.

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
Was it Trinity?

23:50.000 --> 23:51.000
No it wasn't Trinity.

23:51.000 --> 23:52.000
No?

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
Specifically in Reloaded. But anyway.

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
I don't remember.

23:56.000 --> 24:04.000
No. Queen of the Damned was actually released. Z. That was Z. Z was the character in the movie.

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
Yeah I don't remember.

24:06.000 --> 24:12.000
The interesting thing about Jada Pinkett's role is that she was the star of the game.

24:12.000 --> 24:15.000
And they kind of incorporated that into the movie.

24:15.000 --> 24:18.000
Right? Because the game had Jada Pinkett and that other character.

24:18.000 --> 24:23.000
No it wasn't her. It wasn't her as the main character in the game.

24:23.000 --> 24:25.000
I thought she was like the main character in the game.

24:25.000 --> 24:28.000
No it was. I remember. Maybe it was.

24:28.000 --> 24:31.000
That's it. Nona Gaye. It was Marvin Gaye's daughter. Or granddaughter maybe.

24:31.000 --> 24:33.000
So anyway.

24:33.000 --> 24:35.000
I'm trying to remember who the characters were that were in the game.

24:35.000 --> 24:38.000
Thank you Bobby for getting the Wikipedia article faster than I could.

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
I don't remember. I played a lot of it though.

24:40.000 --> 24:45.000
Let's see. There was another good reshoot comment here.

24:45.000 --> 24:52.000
So Bobby also pointing out about reshoots after the trailer. World War Z had some reshoots after the trailer.

24:52.000 --> 24:57.000
S.J. 100 Matt saying didn't Passion of the Christ get toned down after the fact?

24:57.000 --> 25:01.000
Oh it was Niobe. I forgot that she was one of the main characters in that.

25:01.000 --> 25:05.000
So with the Passion of the Christ that was an interesting one too.

25:05.000 --> 25:10.000
Because that movie was very violent. But it was very religious.

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
It was very anti-Semitic.

25:12.000 --> 25:16.000
Well I'm going to keep it to just the information.

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
The trailer is full of spoilers.

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
Anyway.

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
Sorry the book was better.

25:22.000 --> 25:30.000
Here's the thing is that they because of the fact that there was many religious people interested in seeing the movie.

25:30.000 --> 25:34.000
Who had concerns about the violence. They released a PG-13 version of the movie.

25:35.000 --> 25:37.000
Which is not the first time they've done that.

25:37.000 --> 25:42.000
Sometimes our movies get a PG-13 version exactly for that reason.

25:42.000 --> 25:45.000
To try to expand who can kind of go see it.

25:45.000 --> 25:51.000
Wasn't the original cut of Deadpool supposed to be raunchier?

25:51.000 --> 25:58.000
Deadpool 2 had that holiday version that was PG-13.

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
So that's the most recent example of that.

26:00.000 --> 26:05.000
I want to say that Aliens had to be toned down a bit too.

26:05.000 --> 26:09.000
Or how about this for Kill Bill volume 1.

26:09.000 --> 26:15.000
In Japan the big fight scene in the House of Blue Leaves was in color and longer.

26:15.000 --> 26:20.000
And they made it black and white for the US one even though it's like piles of fake blood.

26:20.000 --> 26:24.000
But for some censorship thing to lower the rating.

26:24.000 --> 26:27.000
I have the DVD of the Japanese one.

26:27.000 --> 26:30.000
And honestly the fight's a lot better in color.

26:30.000 --> 26:34.000
I think the anime sequence was altered somehow too.

26:34.000 --> 26:37.000
I don't remember it being. I'd have to watch the two of them again.

26:37.000 --> 26:41.000
I don't even think it was in the Japanese version. I think it was something Tarantino commented on.

26:41.000 --> 26:46.000
I'm irritated. He's kind of come out and said he's not going to end up doing a volume 3 or 4.

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
Which is sad.

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
Anyway, we got off track a little bit.

26:50.000 --> 26:53.000
Because I really wanted to talk about fan backlashes.

26:53.000 --> 26:56.000
But let me ask this question. Let me wrap on this question then we'll move on to our gaming weeks.

26:56.000 --> 26:59.000
Because I know we've talked about this for a little bit. Kind of going down memory lane a little bit.

26:59.000 --> 27:07.000
Do you think this fan backlash to Sonic is a good trend or a bad trend?

27:07.000 --> 27:09.000
Because I want to watch how I'm wording this.

27:09.000 --> 27:13.000
Because I don't want you guys to answer the question about what it means for Sonic.

27:13.000 --> 27:24.000
I want you guys to answer the question. Is it a good precedent that Hollywood is now willing to change somebody's artistic vision based on the feedback?

27:24.000 --> 27:30.000
It's ultimately up to whoever is making the content to make that decision whether they want to change it or not.

27:30.000 --> 27:33.000
I don't think it's a bad trend that people are letting them know what their opinions are.

27:33.000 --> 27:36.000
That's why we have social media. They want to act on it. They can act on it.

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
That's independent from the people criticizing it.

27:38.000 --> 27:45.000
I don't think under any... we should not expect them to change it just because we complain about it.

27:45.000 --> 27:48.000
But that they're going to do it. That's cool.

27:48.000 --> 27:52.000
I mean that's in their best interest because that's going to get more people interested in it.

27:52.000 --> 27:56.000
But that's ultimately their call and I don't think they should blame the backlash on it.

27:56.000 --> 28:03.000
Maybe consider when you're putting out the trailer, make sure that you're showing your best work.

28:03.000 --> 28:09.000
And to be fair, that's not to say that this isn't their fault that they're not showing their best work.

28:09.000 --> 28:18.000
But there's been several times where I think Sony Pictures or maybe Universal or something sends out trailers without music in them sometimes.

28:18.000 --> 28:25.000
They fuck up in that sense where like, dude, I can't believe you did that once and then I can't believe you did that a second time.

28:28.000 --> 28:34.000
But yeah, I mean you're marketing a product. You've got to make sure that if something looks weird, people are going to call you out on it.

28:34.000 --> 28:39.000
I'm going to comments from chat. Bobby Black Wolf, bad trend. I said the same thing about Mass Effect 3's ending.

28:39.000 --> 28:44.000
Kajudo, bad trend. 100%. Bonds 006. I don't want the retooling. I don't want it to be a trend.

28:44.000 --> 28:50.000
Tiger Claw says, they're not going to completely change Sonic. Mark my word. They have a plan B.

28:50.000 --> 28:55.000
Believe it or not, you guys, mark the date and time. I kind of agree with Tiger Claw here.

28:55.000 --> 29:01.000
No tea, no shade. But here's the thing. I don't know so much about the plan B.

29:01.000 --> 29:06.000
I don't think they already have rendered footage that exists of something else. They probably have concept art, sure.

29:06.000 --> 29:10.000
They have a lot of concepts. But here's the thing. I think the part of his comment where he says,

29:11.000 --> 29:16.000
they're not going to change it as much as y'all think they are. I agree with that 100%.

29:16.000 --> 29:20.000
I don't think it's going to be this drastic retooling of Sonic. Maybe they'll take his teeth out.

29:20.000 --> 29:28.000
One thing to consider is that the animation has been done. All they have to do is reskin the frame.

29:28.000 --> 29:36.000
That's all they have to do. You know, maybe tweak animation like on the eyes or something if they do give them the more,

29:36.000 --> 29:46.000
you know, game style visage, you know. But the animation is done. The frames are done.

29:46.000 --> 29:52.000
There's not going to be a whole lot of tweaking people have to do other than a reskin pretty much.

29:52.000 --> 29:59.000
So it's not going to be that thing. But the other thing too is that however it's going to take,

29:59.000 --> 30:03.000
they shouldn't rush it. They really need to take their time and do it right.

30:03.000 --> 30:10.000
I do agree with that. I think I'm kind of like have these with you because I think when it comes to like maybe the clips of him running

30:10.000 --> 30:14.000
or the clips of like I don't think those are necessarily going to need to be changed a lot.

30:14.000 --> 30:21.000
But I think because of that, there's a certain structure to Sonic that is just going to have to stay the same.

30:21.000 --> 30:26.000
Like maybe they can change some of the stuff when he's there talking and they're doing some close up shots and things like that.

30:26.000 --> 30:32.000
But I just think there's like because I don't think they're gonna have time to go back and do all the, you know, chase sequences or whatever.

30:32.000 --> 30:36.000
I think there's a certain frame of his they're going to have to stick with. It's too far gone.

30:36.000 --> 30:44.000
They need to make it worse. I want to make him even taller. His legs even like wider or skinnier or whatever.

30:44.000 --> 30:48.000
Just make it worse. I want it to be worse.

30:48.000 --> 30:51.000
As you know, under Matt says it's a new Coke scheme.

30:51.000 --> 30:55.000
Tweak it a little bit and come off like they care about the original subject matter.

30:55.000 --> 30:59.000
Now here's the question. Will the Blu ray have the original Sonic scenes?

30:59.000 --> 31:02.000
I want to be able to flip between the two.

31:02.000 --> 31:05.000
All right. Look, I've spent enough time talking about that movie.

31:05.000 --> 31:11.000
Like I said, I can't think of any other movie now that Avengers is coming on and Captain Marvel's coming on.

31:11.000 --> 31:15.000
I can't think of any other movie this year that's getting as much talk right now.

31:15.000 --> 31:18.000
So there's that even Detective Pikachu. Now, don't get me wrong.

31:18.000 --> 31:22.000
There's a lot of talk about that. And it sounds like it's going to be great.

31:22.000 --> 31:25.000
Some of the early reviews are saying it doesn't suck.

31:25.000 --> 31:30.000
Like I'm not seeing five stars, but I'm seeing as far as video game movies go.

31:30.000 --> 31:34.000
Not bad. I'm seeing it on Saturday. I want to see it too.

31:34.000 --> 31:39.000
For sure. I definitely want to see Detective Pikachu, but I'll probably go see the Sonic movie too.

31:39.000 --> 31:42.000
I'm seeing that for sure. Absolutely.

31:42.000 --> 31:47.000
Honestly, I just want to see the Jim Carrey 90s stuff. And oh, it's about Sonic the Hedgehog.

31:47.000 --> 31:53.000
I fully, I fully support that movie. And if you don't believe me, go look at my Twitter.

31:54.000 --> 31:58.000
All right. Anyway, moving on.

31:58.000 --> 32:02.000
Let's get into our gaming weeks and the types of games we have been playing this week.

32:02.000 --> 32:06.000
Maybe, maybe somebody has been playing Sonic the Hedgehog in memory. I don't know.

32:06.000 --> 32:09.000
Dark Saga, we'll start with you. How was your gaming week?

32:09.000 --> 32:12.000
It was uneventful. I've had a very, very busy week.

32:12.000 --> 32:18.000
I'm playing lots of Animal Crossing. I got the DJ KK booth and that makes me really happy.

32:18.000 --> 32:24.000
I'm still playing Idle Poring. I kind of don't know if I want to keep playing it.

32:24.000 --> 32:30.000
Just because, I don't know, I'm not getting any further in the game and I'm just kind of bored with it.

32:30.000 --> 32:34.000
Right now I'm playing it out of this weird sense of obligation.

32:34.000 --> 32:42.000
I've been playing Ingress a little bit. Just trying to gather equipment for the event.

32:42.000 --> 32:55.000
We got, I don't know if I said it last week, I don't know if we had it by then, but we have a Doctor Who pinball now.

32:55.000 --> 32:57.000
You did mention it last week.

32:57.000 --> 33:03.000
And on camera, if you look in a minute, I'm going to put up one of the plastics that Dan gave me of a Dalek.

33:03.000 --> 33:07.000
It's a broken one, but it hangs out in my purse now so I can put it in my cube at work.

33:07.000 --> 33:13.000
But I've been playing actually quite a bit more of that because it has one of the best multi-balls ever.

33:13.000 --> 33:21.000
But, I mean, really not a whole lot. It's been kind of a work week for me so it's been mostly doing web design stuff.

33:21.000 --> 33:22.000
That's it.

33:22.000 --> 33:25.000
Fair enough. Loki, how about you? How was your gaming week?

33:25.000 --> 33:29.000
I didn't play a lot of games this week. I played mainly just Pokemon Go.

33:29.000 --> 33:33.000
I've been really bad. I've not played my DDR cabinet in a while.

33:33.000 --> 33:42.000
I'm hoping to change that this week. I've been busy with work stuff, so I've actually been doing work at home on top of work at work.

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
So, yeah. That's my excuse.

33:44.000 --> 33:52.000
This week, though, my wife has gone the entire week on business and stuff, so that means I can stream video games!

33:52.000 --> 33:58.000
And so I have to figure out what I'm going to do, but maybe we'll do some of that this week.

33:58.000 --> 34:07.000
And then I did work on my game a bit more as well, making very small progress on that.

34:07.000 --> 34:19.000
And then I also, because I've been waiting to get something for my PC for a while now, so I finally decided to purchase an Oculus Rift desk.

34:19.000 --> 34:22.000
So I have that pre-ordered now.

34:22.000 --> 34:29.000
So you got in on that, because I heard that Bobby went into a little more depth on his show tonight about that.

34:29.000 --> 34:33.000
Which is funny, because I think we had so many news stories to talk about. I don't think I actually put it on our show roll.

34:33.000 --> 34:41.000
We can talk about it now. That was announced and sold out like that. And you're one of them.

34:41.000 --> 34:46.000
Yeah, I didn't realize that they sold out. I just know that they're shipping by the end of the month, is what it says.

34:46.000 --> 34:52.000
And that's fine, whatever. I wanted it just because I didn't want to have like...

34:52.000 --> 34:56.000
I was going back and forth between that and the Vive, what I wanted.

34:56.000 --> 35:04.000
I stuck with the S just because it has that inside-out tracking, so I don't need to set up all the base stations for that.

35:04.000 --> 35:10.000
It's just headset and two controllers, and then that's it. That's all you really need to get going.

35:11.000 --> 35:17.000
I like how they have it where you can kind of define your room area a little bit, plus they have the pass-through camera on there.

35:17.000 --> 35:28.000
So you can see if your kids come up and start asking you questions, you can flip it over and actually see them through the camera, which is kind of cool.

35:28.000 --> 35:39.000
So I'm looking forward to that. I know that people have been harping on it because they dropped down the frame rate from 90 hertz to 80 hertz.

35:39.000 --> 35:47.000
From what I hear from early reviews, it could be seen two ways. One, it's not a big deal, or two, oh my god, it's a terrible big deal.

35:47.000 --> 35:56.000
You should get the $1,000 headset that has 120 hertz. You know what, I'm not spending $1,000 on a goddamn VR headset.

35:56.000 --> 36:02.000
I'll spend the same amount of money that I was going to spend on an actual Oculus Rift and get the better Oculus Rift.

36:03.000 --> 36:13.000
And I'm just fine with that because I don't know if this laptop can push the 120 hertz in the higher resolution without melting itself.

36:13.000 --> 36:24.000
So I'll be fine with just that. Besides, I'm not going to exactly use it for anything super important other than playing Moshpit Simulator and really dumb VR shit.

36:24.000 --> 36:28.000
So that's all I'm looking forward to.

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
Bring it to the show because I want to check that out.

36:30.000 --> 36:31.000
Definitely.

36:31.000 --> 36:37.000
I mean, I'm fortunate enough where I'm sure Bobby will bring the latest and greatest VR to Dragon Con, but I still want to see it when he gets it.

36:37.000 --> 36:49.000
Yeah, I mean, and I would be down if I had like a dedicated space to do gaming, I would be down with something more elaborate where I actually have to set up those base stations and stuff, but I don't have that kind of space.

36:49.000 --> 37:02.000
So I'm fine with, you know, something where I can go out into the living room, draw my little box that I'm going to play in and just play without having to, you know, set up a bunch of stuff and mount stuff to the wall and that kind of crap.

37:02.000 --> 37:05.000
So I'm looking forward to that coming in at some point.

37:05.000 --> 37:08.000
And yeah, I don't know.

37:08.000 --> 37:09.000
All right, cool.

37:09.000 --> 37:10.000
So that's it.

37:10.000 --> 37:11.000
All right, the mic gaming week.

37:11.000 --> 37:12.000
I'll start with VR.

37:12.000 --> 37:13.000
I'll piggyback off you guys.

37:14.000 --> 37:17.000
So VR, I've been playing a lot of Beat Saber still on PlayStation 4.

37:17.000 --> 37:21.000
PlayStation is the only VR I have right now, but it suits my needs for what I want to play.

37:21.000 --> 37:23.000
So Beat Saber is great.

37:23.000 --> 37:25.000
I find that it's just really good exercise.

37:25.000 --> 37:32.000
So like on days where I haven't really been able to get to the gym just because, like, especially Sundays are bad because we went to brunch earlier and I have to prep for OLR.

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
And the gym is like 20 minutes away.

37:34.000 --> 37:38.000
So it's like I, you know, I kind of have to, you know, stay here.

37:38.000 --> 37:42.000
So Beat Saber is great for just kind of like getting moving and burning some calories and all that.

37:42.000 --> 37:43.000
And I just love that game.

37:43.000 --> 37:45.000
Do they have like a calorie tracker type thing in there?

37:45.000 --> 37:46.000
I have my watch.

37:46.000 --> 37:47.000
My watch does all that stuff.

37:47.000 --> 37:48.000
So yeah.

37:48.000 --> 37:49.000
So I can just feel it.

37:49.000 --> 37:53.000
You know, you can just kind of feel it, how worn out you are after playing because I play a lot of stuff on that hard.

37:53.000 --> 37:58.000
I've been kind of toning back on expert a little bit just because I keep failing on expert.

37:58.000 --> 38:04.000
So I'm like, all right, let me go through and like do everything on hard, you know, and get some trophies that way, which I've been getting more trophies on PS4 and stuff.

38:04.000 --> 38:07.000
And then I'll go back and do the expert because, you know, again, PlayStation 4 is not modded.

38:07.000 --> 38:14.000
So I only have like the official sanctioned songs, but with that official pack, there's that additional monster cat.

38:14.000 --> 38:19.000
Sorry, I forget the name of the label, but they have that, that DLC pack that was like 10 more songs.

38:19.000 --> 38:20.000
So they're monster cat.

38:20.000 --> 38:21.000
Yeah, there is that.

38:21.000 --> 38:25.000
And I think there's a second pack of those that's supposed to be coming at some point.

38:25.000 --> 38:32.000
So yeah, I have enough to play in that game and I've been having a good time and then piggybacking on something that Jamie talked about.

38:32.000 --> 38:37.000
I also have been playing a little bit of Ingress and Pokemon Go for the two of you out there to play Ingress.

38:37.000 --> 38:44.000
I'm trying to get back to level 12 post recursion before the anomaly in Chicago because I got that event in three weeks.

38:44.000 --> 38:51.000
I did play a little bit of Ingress too, but it was because my son does the programming class at this place, Code Ninjas.

38:51.000 --> 38:57.000
And they're like, so do you know how we would submit to become a Poke stop?

38:57.000 --> 38:58.000
I'm like, well, you got to do it through Ingress.

38:58.000 --> 39:01.000
So I submitted their location as an Ingress portal.

39:01.000 --> 39:03.000
So I was like, why not?

39:03.000 --> 39:09.000
You know, I mean, I've seen the, you know, the rabbit over at the gymnastics place to be a Poke stop.

39:09.000 --> 39:15.000
So I'm like, or, you know, Ingress portal poke sound like, well, if that can be one, then I don't see why this couldn't be one.

39:15.000 --> 39:16.000
It's a place of education.

39:16.000 --> 39:17.000
Yeah.

39:17.000 --> 39:19.000
So, yeah, no, it would meet the criteria.

39:19.000 --> 39:28.000
You just have to hope it's, you know, not in a area where the other players are going to be like, I don't want that team to have a part of them because I shouldn't really just do what I do.

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
And if it doesn't make it through the first time, just keep submitting it.

39:30.000 --> 39:31.000
It'll go through eventually.

39:31.000 --> 39:34.000
It's ridiculous, but it works.

39:34.000 --> 39:35.000
Let's see.

39:35.000 --> 39:37.000
Anyway, what else?

39:37.000 --> 39:39.000
I've been playing Pokemon Go as well.

39:39.000 --> 39:42.000
I haven't done the new raid yet, though, which I think is coming up later in the show.

39:42.000 --> 39:45.000
So I probably shouldn't spoil it too much, but I have not done the new raid yet.

39:45.000 --> 39:47.000
I need to do that.

39:47.000 --> 39:56.000
And then as far as like other stuff, been playing some Final Fantasy 14 and continuing to try to get the max level gear.

39:56.000 --> 40:00.000
I even did a stream this week on my personal stream, which I haven't done in a long time.

40:00.000 --> 40:01.000
So I did that.

40:01.000 --> 40:03.000
And still playing a little Borderlands here and there.

40:03.000 --> 40:08.000
So I'm keeping myself pretty busy, but haven't really explored a lot of new games for me right now.

40:08.000 --> 40:11.000
Just kind of relying on my old favorites for the moment.

40:11.000 --> 40:12.000
All right.

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
Well, we're going to move on.

40:14.000 --> 40:23.000
Speaking of not being here and events and things like that, I just want to remind you guys we will not be here in three weeks.

40:23.000 --> 40:25.000
That's Memorial Day weekend.

40:25.000 --> 40:28.000
We're going to have a show live, but I hope you guys will have a fun weekend.

40:28.000 --> 40:31.000
I'm not sure if Bobby's here that weekend or not.

40:31.000 --> 40:32.000
I'll have to see you in chat.

40:32.000 --> 40:35.000
But I am going to be off in Chicago.

40:35.000 --> 40:36.000
I'm doing an Ingress thing there.

40:36.000 --> 40:41.000
And I have a lot of friends in Chicago, so it's kind of like, you know, the Ingress thing is a convenient excuse to do while I'm there.

40:41.000 --> 40:43.000
You said Memorial Day weekend?

40:43.000 --> 40:44.000
Yes, Memorial Day weekend.

40:44.000 --> 40:45.000
Okay.

40:45.000 --> 40:48.000
And then Dark Sakura is at DragCon, which...

40:48.000 --> 40:54.000
And God, it's going to be busy because not only am I going to DragCon, I'm going to San Diego the day after.

40:55.000 --> 40:57.000
To see a couple.

40:57.000 --> 41:02.000
If I had time for it, I'd go even further south and see Agdeft, but I don't have a passport either.

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
Oh, yeah, you kind of need one of those.

41:04.000 --> 41:09.000
But I'm going to San Diego for one day and then Tuesday I'm going to Disneyland.

41:09.000 --> 41:17.000
I'm probably not going to do the Harry Potter thing unless I hate myself and want to drive back on Friday and go to work Saturday.

41:17.000 --> 41:20.000
Yeah, I would be full of self-hatred.

41:20.000 --> 41:21.000
That'd be a lot.

41:21.000 --> 41:23.000
I'm planning, as it is, I'm driving back up by myself.

41:23.000 --> 41:25.000
That sounds like it's going to be an action-packed trip, so that'll be fun.

41:25.000 --> 41:29.000
It is. It'll be a lot of fun, but I'm going to be way exhausted. I was super exhausted after Easter.

41:29.000 --> 41:30.000
Yeah.

41:30.000 --> 41:41.000
But I will see so many sisters and drag queens, and if you are in that area and want to have lunch or something, we'll go to Roscoe's.

41:41.000 --> 41:43.000
Hit me up on Twitter.

41:43.000 --> 41:44.000
Yeah.

41:44.000 --> 41:48.000
I suppose the same could be said for Chicago, but I don't know if I'll do any arcade-y things while I'm there.

41:48.000 --> 41:49.000
Spring me back chocolate.

41:49.000 --> 41:52.000
Yeah, I might get out to replay or something again.

41:52.000 --> 41:56.000
I can get those bars now, by the way, but those bonbons, holy shit.

41:56.000 --> 41:57.000
Right.

41:57.000 --> 42:00.000
Let's get into some gaming news and talk about what's been going on.

42:00.000 --> 42:04.000
In the world of gaming this week, there's still a lot of news to cover.

42:04.000 --> 42:05.000
Loki, why don't you start us off?

42:05.000 --> 42:06.000
Yeah, so this is kind of cool.

42:06.000 --> 42:20.000
There was this game, A Dark Room, that basically is this text-based role-playing game, and the guy that made it, Amir Rajan,

42:20.000 --> 42:33.000
he put that, well, the game was released a couple weeks ago, put that if you connect a USB keyboard to it and hit the title key, it'll actually open up a code editor.

42:33.000 --> 42:34.000
You mean the tilde?

42:34.000 --> 42:35.000
Tilde, yeah.

42:35.000 --> 42:38.000
It's a title, like it's a music streaming service.

42:38.000 --> 42:39.000
Sorry, yeah, tilde.

42:39.000 --> 42:40.000
Yes.

42:41.000 --> 42:59.000
It'll actually open up a Ruby programming language interpreter and code editor that he put in the hit in the game, which the whole point was, he basically put it that he liked coding and he wanted to create games.

42:59.000 --> 43:11.000
Back in the 90s, it was difficult to do that, but now, being that it's more modern, it's easier for people to get into that, and he wanted kids to kind of get into that as well and tinker around.

43:11.000 --> 43:22.000
Of course, Nintendo did not agree with that, and they decided to pull the game off the shop because, you know, code editor, running your own code, oh my god, hacks!

43:22.000 --> 43:28.000
So that's unfortunate for him that you're not going to be able to do that.

43:28.000 --> 43:31.000
I don't think they released a physical version of this, but...

43:31.000 --> 43:36.000
I don't think they did, and the bummer is, this is such a huge infraction.

43:36.000 --> 43:39.000
It's probably going to make him persona non grata with Nintendo.

43:39.000 --> 43:42.000
I don't know if he's going to be able to get his game back or any other game.

43:42.000 --> 43:49.000
That's a pretty big deal, but help me understand, the coding that you could do, could you really mess with your Switch with it?

43:49.000 --> 43:50.000
I don't think so.

43:50.000 --> 43:54.000
I think it's just kind of like a basic editor type thing, but I don't know.

43:54.000 --> 43:56.000
Someone's going to find a way around it.

43:56.000 --> 44:02.000
Mario Maker is kind of coding. My thing is, you can make games in other games.

44:02.000 --> 44:10.000
I guess my brain goes to a little big planet, but I guess there's nothing on the Switch that allows you to freely type things.

44:10.000 --> 44:14.000
Maybe they're worried that the door is left open too much on that.

44:14.000 --> 44:23.000
Yeah, he said basically, the code editors, all it can do is draw lines, squares, labels, play sounds from the game, and detect button presses.

44:23.000 --> 44:26.000
It says you can't even render an image with the damn thing.

44:26.000 --> 44:35.000
Yes, if your app is composed completely of labels, squares, and lines, it lets you build an app without having to perform any hacks.

44:35.000 --> 44:38.000
Are you able to draw a penis out of dashes and lines?

44:38.000 --> 44:39.000
Yes.

44:39.000 --> 44:45.000
Well, that's Nintendo's problem. We cannot have ASCII penis on our system.

44:45.000 --> 44:47.000
That is foreboding.

44:47.000 --> 44:48.000
There it is.

44:48.000 --> 44:52.000
Heaven forbid some of those stages in Super Smash, let me tell you.

44:52.000 --> 44:58.000
But heaven forbid somebody be allowed to program their own wiener.

44:58.000 --> 45:06.000
But yeah, basically the problem is that he cheated their approval process, and so that's why they didn't like that.

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
That's unfortunate.

45:08.000 --> 45:12.000
Yeah, I mean, you have to disclose everything that's in there.

45:12.000 --> 45:23.000
And that's really the biggest infraction because, for example, this has actually happened to Elder Scrolls Oblivion.

45:23.000 --> 45:28.000
They submitted their game for a rating, and you have to disclose everything that's in the game, and they got their rating.

45:28.000 --> 45:38.000
But then come to find out, the PC version could be hacked so that you could find OMG, a bear titty on the actual CD.

45:38.000 --> 45:48.000
The actual texture was a bear titty, and because they didn't disclose that, when they went for their rating, the game got an adults-only rating.

45:48.000 --> 45:51.000
Was it titty, or was it the Southern Hemisphere? Was that the problem?

45:51.000 --> 45:52.000
Which game?

45:52.000 --> 45:57.000
Elder Scrolls Oblivion. Remember how it got re-rated, AO, because of textures that were found on the original CD?

45:57.000 --> 46:04.000
Okay, fuck it. Grand Theft Auto, Hot Coffee mod. There's another great example.

46:04.000 --> 46:11.000
Hot Coffee was not accessible without some type of game genie-esque sort of code or altercation.

46:11.000 --> 46:17.000
But because Hot Coffee existed on that disc, it got Grand Theft Auto that AO rating.

46:17.000 --> 46:19.000
Y'all know that one. That was a big deal.

46:19.000 --> 46:26.000
Well, if you're wanting the mess of that Ruby interpreter, he does have it available to mess around with for free.

46:26.000 --> 46:30.000
So go to dragonruby.itch.io and you can check it out.

46:30.000 --> 46:39.000
Interesting that in spite of all that, he's still kind of like putting it out there for free. That seems bold, we'll say.

46:39.000 --> 46:43.000
That seems like what Weird Al did with your Pitiful song.

46:43.000 --> 46:49.000
I'm sorry, the toolkit's actually 40 bucks, but you can actually purchase it if you want to.

46:49.000 --> 46:52.000
That was the Gaga thing too, wasn't it?

46:52.000 --> 47:01.000
No, he didn't do that. One of Gaga's representatives said that she wanted to hear the whole song first.

47:01.000 --> 47:09.000
And then she's like, no, I'm fine with it, you can do it. It was the recording company for James Blunt.

47:10.000 --> 47:14.000
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Whatever happened to him, by the way. Yeah, right?

47:14.000 --> 47:15.000
Still can't sing.

47:15.000 --> 47:24.000
So, anyway. Oh, Bobby's got a whole article on the Wikipedias about this. Here's the Oblivion thing.

47:24.000 --> 47:29.000
So Bobby copied Pasta in chat. What Bethesda had originally disclosed to us is an example.

47:29.000 --> 47:35.000
In that section of the game, there's a hanging corpse. What they disclosed to us was a hanging corpse in the dark, pretty far away and without much detail.

47:35.000 --> 47:41.000
And yet when you bring a torch up to the hanging corpse in the actual game, you can see that it's very mutilated with lots of blood and bones.

47:41.000 --> 47:46.000
That was a very different depiction, far more intense, far more extreme than what had been disclosed to us.

47:46.000 --> 47:55.000
So, I mean, the disclosure is important. So whether Nintendo is afraid of ASCII dicks in this editor or not, whatever that issue is,

47:55.000 --> 48:04.000
the problem really is that this is a pretty full-fledged feature that he put in this game and intentionally made it difficult to access that people wouldn't find it.

48:04.000 --> 48:13.000
And then was like, you know, it was a problem. He didn't disclose it. And if he had disclosed it, maybe Nintendo could have reviewed it and seen it's not that big a deal.

48:13.000 --> 48:18.000
You can't run homebrew on it and maybe would have let it stay. Who knows?

48:18.000 --> 48:23.000
So, I kind of doubt they would have let it stay. But we like to think that way, right?

48:23.000 --> 48:27.000
We like to think Nintendo is going to be a little more proactive like that. Who knows?

48:27.000 --> 48:34.000
Anyway, let's move on. And let's talk about Platinum Games. Y'all like Platinum Games, right?

48:34.000 --> 48:39.000
Platinum Games is set to start self-publishing.

48:39.000 --> 48:44.000
Platinum is going to be self-publishing their games such as...

48:44.000 --> 48:52.000
Well, we don't know exactly what games yet, but we know some examples of games that were kind of one and done were things like The Wonderful 101 and Vanquish.

48:52.000 --> 48:57.000
And because Platinum doesn't really publish these themselves, they can't really control if a sequel is going to happen or not.

48:57.000 --> 49:02.000
And I'm sure most people, when they think of Platinum and sequels and that whole thing, they think about Bayonetta.

49:02.000 --> 49:11.000
And so there was an interview recently with Video Games Chronicle where Atsushi Inaba, who's the head of Platinum, said that they want to self-publish their games.

49:11.000 --> 49:16.000
Because quote, what it means is we have a lot of different choices in the way that we want to make games.

49:16.000 --> 49:22.000
It's that simple. And quite frankly, in the case of Bayonetta, it took a lot of time and energy to get it to the point where sequels could be made.

49:22.000 --> 49:26.000
It wasn't as simple as picking up the phone and asking, hey, can we do this?

49:26.000 --> 49:30.000
There were lots of pieces that needed to fall into place and a lot of negotiating that had to occur.

49:30.000 --> 49:37.000
It's absolutely the truth that there are cases where you want to do a sequel, but if you don't own the IP, you can't do it.

49:37.000 --> 49:44.000
Platinum also has two unannounced games in development, so we don't know if there's any possible sequels are there.

49:44.000 --> 49:47.000
Well, I guess not because the IP, they can't bring back something wonderful 101.

49:47.000 --> 49:52.000
So there are going to be new IPs most likely and things that are owned by the studio.

49:52.000 --> 49:53.000
Marvelous 102.

49:53.000 --> 49:59.000
They're saying we're in the middle of designing, the continued quote here from the studio head,

49:59.000 --> 50:02.000
we're in the middle of designing something that has never been done before.

50:02.000 --> 50:07.000
I know a lot of people say that, but the game we're working on is truly unlike anything else.

50:07.000 --> 50:10.000
This is something that has never been designed before.

50:10.000 --> 50:14.000
So from a game design perspective, we're very excited right now.

50:14.000 --> 50:17.000
Big words about the whole never seen this before.

50:17.000 --> 50:19.000
It'll be interesting to see if it's really true.

50:19.000 --> 50:23.000
I would also like to know if they were able to do something with Scalebound.

50:23.000 --> 50:28.000
Did they maybe change things around in the game so it doesn't look like the project that Microsoft funded

50:28.000 --> 50:31.000
and maybe that's something they're going to put out after all?

50:31.000 --> 50:32.000
Who knows?

50:32.000 --> 50:33.000
Who knows?

50:33.000 --> 50:38.000
You see, this game that we've never attempted before, it's like Bayonetta.

50:38.000 --> 50:46.000
But instead of putting guns on our hands and on our feet, this dude is going to have a gun out of his ass.

50:48.000 --> 50:50.000
Why not? Why not? Let's do it.

50:50.000 --> 50:53.000
We're going to call it Wrecked Gun.

50:56.000 --> 50:58.000
Oh my god, I'm so glad you're not a game designer.

50:59.000 --> 51:00.000
Oh darn.

51:04.000 --> 51:06.000
Bayonetta 3 is still a thing.

51:06.000 --> 51:10.000
Hey, remember? Bayonetta 3 got announced a couple years ago.

51:10.000 --> 51:12.000
And that was the last we heard. Yes!

51:12.000 --> 51:16.000
Yeah, remember? Hello? Remember? Bayonetta 3 is the thing that's happening.

51:16.000 --> 51:17.000
And that's all we know.

51:18.000 --> 51:20.000
It was a very quick announcement trailer.

51:20.000 --> 51:21.000
I'm hoping...

51:21.000 --> 51:26.000
Well, you can't announce things like four years, like several years ago and then just like all of a sudden...

51:26.000 --> 51:27.000
Yeah, you can.

51:27.000 --> 51:28.000
I guess you can.

51:28.000 --> 51:30.000
Everybody does it, I guess.

51:30.000 --> 51:32.000
E3 is what? Like the week?

51:33.000 --> 51:35.000
Here's the thing. So we're gone Memorial Day weekend.

51:35.000 --> 51:42.000
I think that week we get back is the night that Bethesda interrupts our show with their press conference because E3 is like underway.

51:42.000 --> 51:45.000
So, I mean, E3 is just around the corner.

51:45.000 --> 51:47.000
So I'm super curious if Bayonetta 3...

51:47.000 --> 51:48.000
I should just stay in LA.

51:48.000 --> 51:50.000
...isn't going to show up. I know, right? You should just go to E3.

51:50.000 --> 51:51.000
No, I can't.

51:51.000 --> 51:52.000
I know.

51:52.000 --> 51:55.000
I'm sorry, but I would rather be at work than go to E3.

51:57.000 --> 52:00.000
E3 is work in some ways, depending on who you're representing.

52:00.000 --> 52:05.000
No, I'm going to be around so many people for a convention I'm actually interested in, so...

52:07.000 --> 52:08.000
I'll let...

52:08.000 --> 52:10.000
There's a little salt around here when it comes to E3.

52:10.000 --> 52:13.000
No, let them jerk each other off. I don't care.

52:14.000 --> 52:21.000
Let them show their game dicks and let everyone else compare them.

52:21.000 --> 52:25.000
I'll just wait for it to come out from the comfort of my own home.

52:26.000 --> 52:28.000
They don't give out good swag anymore.

52:28.000 --> 52:31.000
Let them put that on the poster for E3. Let them jerk each other off.

52:33.000 --> 52:36.000
That's not on the approved Microsoft list, unfortunately.

52:37.000 --> 52:41.000
As long as they've got some good dick jiggle physics. I mean, that's really all people want.

52:41.000 --> 52:44.000
Listing! Get sexual threat.

52:46.000 --> 52:48.000
Can you save that for later in the show? Excuse me.

52:48.000 --> 52:49.000
Oh, no, we gotta...

52:49.000 --> 52:51.000
Are you all paying attention? We have a list.

52:51.000 --> 52:54.000
Everything is very... It's up on the screen, even though I haven't been totally right with it.

52:54.000 --> 52:57.000
It's a list, and I don't see... Do you see the Microsoft thing up there yet?

52:57.000 --> 52:59.000
That's me flipping off the list. Sorry, Lucky.

53:00.000 --> 53:01.000
You better get to the next item on the list.

53:01.000 --> 53:02.000
I'm very delicate.

53:02.000 --> 53:04.000
The next item on the list is yours.

53:04.000 --> 53:05.000
Yeah, whatever.

53:06.000 --> 53:08.000
Rocket League! Who likes Rocket League in this room?

53:08.000 --> 53:11.000
I think it's cool. I wish I had more time to play more of it.

53:11.000 --> 53:18.000
Well, their developer, Psyonix, is, quote, joining the Epic Games family.

53:18.000 --> 53:21.000
So Epic Games ruined something else.

53:22.000 --> 53:23.000
Not yet.

53:23.000 --> 53:24.000
Not yet.

53:24.000 --> 53:26.000
They're planning to ruin it.

53:26.000 --> 53:29.000
Well, the ruination is happening.

53:29.000 --> 53:33.000
It's going to be closing in late May or early June.

53:33.000 --> 53:36.000
They've released an FAQ about this.

53:36.000 --> 53:38.000
But they wanted to...

53:39.000 --> 53:42.000
I guess they're just acquiring it because Rocket League is good.

53:42.000 --> 53:46.000
I mean, maybe? I don't know. They just like ruining things for people.

53:46.000 --> 53:48.000
Yeah, Rocket League's pretty good.

53:48.000 --> 53:53.000
It's an interesting title because Rocket League has esports, conventions.

53:54.000 --> 53:57.000
You don't want to just poo-poo right off this game.

53:57.000 --> 54:00.000
Rocket League has a huge following behind it.

54:00.000 --> 54:02.000
I want to say, I hope I'm not misappropriating,

54:02.000 --> 54:04.000
but I want to say our voiceover guy, Jason,

54:04.000 --> 54:08.000
really is into Rocket League and goes to some of these events and things like that.

54:08.000 --> 54:12.000
So there's definitely a culture out there that loves this game.

54:12.000 --> 54:17.000
Well, at any rate, they want to assure people that nothing will change

54:17.000 --> 54:20.000
about the day-to-day enjoyment of their game.

54:20.000 --> 54:25.000
I think it's kind of interesting that that wording is used.

54:25.000 --> 54:28.000
So basically, in the short term, they say nothing about the game will change.

54:28.000 --> 54:32.000
But they're still going to go with its update roadmap

54:32.000 --> 54:36.000
and to keep it going for, quote, as long as you'll have us.

54:37.000 --> 54:42.000
Psyonix said that they will bring the game to the Epic Games Store

54:42.000 --> 54:47.000
and that this is, of course, because the acquisition will allow them to grow the game

54:47.000 --> 54:49.000
so they couldn't do it on their own.

54:49.000 --> 54:52.000
So I don't know.

54:52.000 --> 54:55.000
They said nothing's changing, but we'll see.

54:55.000 --> 54:58.000
Here's why I think Rocket League does well

54:58.000 --> 55:01.000
and why I actually enjoy Rocket League a lot too.

55:01.000 --> 55:05.000
Here's why Rocket League, and it's honestly a great land for Epic,

55:05.000 --> 55:08.000
whether you are a fan of Epic or not,

55:08.000 --> 55:10.000
it makes sense why they want to have this game

55:10.000 --> 55:13.000
because, as is mentioned in chat over there,

55:13.000 --> 55:17.000
SSG100Matt says Rocket League is serious esports, and for sure.

55:17.000 --> 55:19.000
Here's the thing about Rocket League.

55:19.000 --> 55:21.000
It's a stupidly simple game to explain.

55:21.000 --> 55:23.000
See this car?

55:23.000 --> 55:26.000
Use car to push ball in goal.

55:26.000 --> 55:27.000
Car soccer. Two words.

55:27.000 --> 55:29.000
Yeah, car soccer. Go.

55:29.000 --> 55:31.000
And that's Rocket League, right?

55:31.000 --> 55:34.000
Where is Dota 2?

55:34.000 --> 55:36.000
Let's explain Dota 2.

55:36.000 --> 55:38.000
You ready?

55:38.000 --> 55:42.000
So you have these lanes, and every lane has some walls and towers,

55:42.000 --> 55:44.000
and you're trying to catch the thing at the end of the lane,

55:44.000 --> 55:46.000
and you have these 50 different heroes,

55:46.000 --> 55:47.000
and let me explain to you how they're all different,

55:47.000 --> 55:49.000
and you have this little thing that you can send back to the store.

55:49.000 --> 55:52.000
I'm sorry, that sounds really boring.

55:52.000 --> 55:54.000
Here's the thing, and I'm not knocking Dota.

55:54.000 --> 55:57.000
I think Dota is super fun in its own way as well,

55:57.000 --> 56:00.000
but I think it also goes to, like,

56:00.000 --> 56:04.000
I have a lot of friends that say they really enjoy board games,

56:04.000 --> 56:09.000
and when I respond, I love Clue, they get pissed off.

56:09.000 --> 56:11.000
But here's the thing.

56:12.000 --> 56:15.000
Clue is very much a board game,

56:15.000 --> 56:18.000
and Clue is a board game you can explain in five minutes.

56:18.000 --> 56:19.000
Maybe ten.

56:19.000 --> 56:22.000
Clue is a little more complicated than something like Candyland.

56:22.000 --> 56:26.000
And everybody has their own house rules for Clue.

56:26.000 --> 56:30.000
Like, for example, do you bring the piece to the conservatory

56:30.000 --> 56:32.000
when you make an accusation,

56:32.000 --> 56:34.000
or does it get to stay on the square where it's at?

56:34.000 --> 56:35.000
Every house plays it differently.

56:35.000 --> 56:38.000
Movie rules. You explained it all in the foyer.

56:38.000 --> 56:41.000
So, but then, so there's that,

56:41.000 --> 56:44.000
but then there's also Axis and Allies.

56:44.000 --> 56:47.000
Like, that's the type of board game that if I don't know how to play that,

56:47.000 --> 56:49.000
I'm not a fucking fan.

56:49.000 --> 56:51.000
So anyway, my point is,

56:51.000 --> 56:55.000
I think part of the reason why Rocket League is so loved

56:55.000 --> 56:58.000
and so well in esports

56:58.000 --> 57:02.000
is that it's a relatively simple concept when all is said and done.

57:02.000 --> 57:04.000
It's a Clue. It's a monopoly.

57:04.000 --> 57:07.000
It's a very easy concept, and that doesn't make it bad.

57:07.000 --> 57:11.000
Those are, Scrabble is a game in every household, almost.

57:11.000 --> 57:15.000
Okay? It's, you know, just a very easy type of game.

57:15.000 --> 57:17.000
Bonds006 in chat says,

57:17.000 --> 57:20.000
OMG, why I did not get into Dota.

57:20.000 --> 57:22.000
I think going off my explanation there.

57:22.000 --> 57:24.000
Kaijuto says,

57:24.000 --> 57:27.000
The main reason why people love Rocket League

57:27.000 --> 57:29.000
is because when you learn to fly and make aerials,

57:29.000 --> 57:32.000
you feel badass. It's a feel-good game.

57:32.000 --> 57:34.000
Bobby Blackwolf says,

57:34.000 --> 57:37.000
Rocket League is closer to traditional sports

57:37.000 --> 57:40.000
than something like Overwatch.

57:40.000 --> 57:43.000
That's a good, you know, I know that might sound,

57:43.000 --> 57:46.000
but I get it. Like, because, yeah, it's kinda soccer.

57:46.000 --> 57:48.000
Kinda. Sorta.

57:48.000 --> 57:51.000
And then they put new modes in the game that are like, kinda basketball.

57:51.000 --> 57:53.000
Yeah, as 200Matt said,

57:53.000 --> 57:56.000
I had friends play a full map game of Axis and Allies,

57:56.000 --> 57:58.000
so I don't know why I pick on Axis and Allies.

57:58.000 --> 57:59.000
It's a fine game.

57:59.000 --> 58:02.000
But yeah, one of my friends in high school tried to teach me how to play that game,

58:02.000 --> 58:03.000
and I was just like,

58:03.000 --> 58:05.000
And by the way, did you know, like,

58:05.000 --> 58:07.000
when I was playing Magic the Gathering,

58:07.000 --> 58:10.000
like, for the first year I played Magic the Gathering,

58:10.000 --> 58:12.000
my friends and I were playing it completely wrong.

58:12.000 --> 58:14.000
Completely wrong.

58:14.000 --> 58:17.000
Like, we didn't understand the mechanics.

58:17.000 --> 58:19.000
And when the computer game came out

58:19.000 --> 58:21.000
that kinda forced you to play by the officials,

58:21.000 --> 58:23.000
I'm talking the original computer game

58:23.000 --> 58:26.000
that came with the giant fucking Magic the Gathering card

58:26.000 --> 58:29.000
and all that stuff, like, it's, yeah, it was very enlightening.

58:29.000 --> 58:32.000
I had, like, one of the ginormous Lords of the Pit.

58:32.000 --> 58:35.000
And we used to use the, what was it, the candelabra

58:35.000 --> 58:38.000
that let you, like, shuffle any one card into your deck.

58:39.000 --> 58:43.000
We would use that particular card to bring out the giant Lord of the Pit

58:43.000 --> 58:46.000
that we could put all of his little pitties on it.

58:46.000 --> 58:48.000
And then, of course, every so often we would randomly, like,

58:48.000 --> 58:51.000
mix in a card from another game, like, we'd have Captain Picard.

58:51.000 --> 58:54.000
And our house rule is that if Captain Picard came out,

58:54.000 --> 58:57.000
everyone loses. Everyone else loses. It's an insta-win.

58:58.000 --> 59:00.000
Card games. Another good example.

59:00.000 --> 59:02.000
Card games. Very easy.

59:02.000 --> 59:04.000
Cards Against Humanity.

59:04.000 --> 59:06.000
You teach somebody how to play that game in two seconds, right?

59:06.000 --> 59:08.000
Card game like, um...

59:08.000 --> 59:10.000
Taboo is another easy one.

59:10.000 --> 59:12.000
Taboo is pretty, I'm trying to think of a complicated card game.

59:12.000 --> 59:14.000
I've only ever played it drunk.

59:14.000 --> 59:16.000
What about, like, playing something like, um...

59:16.000 --> 59:18.000
A deck-building game.

59:18.000 --> 59:19.000
Gin.

59:19.000 --> 59:20.000
Dominion.

59:20.000 --> 59:22.000
Oh, Cribbage.

59:22.000 --> 59:23.000
Cribbage.

59:23.000 --> 59:26.000
Yeah, that's, I mean, it's not, I mean, Cribbage isn't, like, hard,

59:26.000 --> 59:28.000
but it definitely takes, like, gets some explanation.

59:28.000 --> 59:30.000
There's an explanation to it, for sure.

59:30.000 --> 59:32.000
P-Nuckle. Another good example.

59:32.000 --> 59:34.000
They're not hard games. They just take a while to explain.

59:35.000 --> 59:36.000
Yeah.

59:36.000 --> 59:38.000
Anyway. Let's move on. We can talk about card games all night,

59:38.000 --> 59:40.000
but I wanna talk, speaking of esports,

59:40.000 --> 59:42.000
there's a Scandalos going on, right?

59:42.000 --> 59:44.000
Yeah, it's, it's not,

59:44.000 --> 59:46.000
I mean, it's, it's not good,

59:46.000 --> 59:48.000
but it's not as bad as

59:48.000 --> 59:50.000
we might allude to, but...

59:50.000 --> 59:52.000
So, basically, during this, uh,

59:54.000 --> 59:56.000
the, I guess, uh, World Cup qualifiers

59:56.000 --> 59:58.000
for Fortnite,

59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000
there was one of the, um,

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000
pro players, uh,

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000
DamienXXIFCook.

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000
He was, uh,

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000
accused of colluding with other players

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
to help him rank up.

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000
So, basically, there's, um,

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000
video out there of him

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.000
landing next to

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000
a couple, uh, other players,

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000
and, basically, the other players allowing him

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000
to kill them to kinda help

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000
rank up. And, of course,

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000
that went viral, and,

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000
um,

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000
you know, that's not a good, good face.

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000
But, on top of that, though,

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000
apparently, uh,

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000
there's been other cheaters

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000
as well. So,

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000
along with that, um,

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000
Epic Games actually went and did some

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000
investigating to see kinda

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000
what was going on, and there's

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000
been bans. So, 14-day

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000
competitive bans on several

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000
different players, um, including,

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000
I think, they didn't name

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000
XXIF, but I believe

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000
that they were

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000
included as well, and they have been stripped of

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.000
their qualifying spots.

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000
Because of, um,

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000
boosting other players.

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000
The boosting thing's been a problem in Overwatch.

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000
Yeah, so.

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000
Boy.

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000
You know, it's kinda hard when you have

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000
these online games that you're trying to do qualifiers

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000
in without, like, any really big oversight.

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000
It's also an interesting thing that doesn't really

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000
I'm trying to think, is there an equivalent in, like,

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000
football, basketball,

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000
as we know it, like, you know, traditional sports,

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000
if you will, is there an equivalent of boosting?

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000
I don't think there really is. No, it would be like throwing

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000
a game, but, like,

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000
Yeah, I guess throwing a game is very bad, but, like,

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000
you know, if you go and

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000
mentor a camp or something,

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000
you're not exactly breaking the rules, you know,

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000
or, I guess, can you wear a disguise

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000
and go play a minor league game? I guess that

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000
would be, like, the closest thing I can think of.

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000
Like, you're wearing a fake mustache

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000
and playing in a minor league game.

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000
Yeah, that's, that's, that's a little different.

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000
This is more of, like, I think, yeah, just,

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.000
just, like, oh, hey, you know,

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.000
we really want those kings

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.000
to make it to the playoffs, so let's just all

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.000
kind of drop the ball and let them throw in

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000
those three-pointers, that type of thing.

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000
Oh, kings are never gonna make the playoffs. Exactly.

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000
That's the only way they would ever win.

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000
But no one's ever gonna do that because

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000
they all wanna win, and, yeah.

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000
Alright, well, let's talk about something,

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000
uh, highly interactive. That's right here,

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000
Twitch, Twitch TV, where, uh, you can

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000
interact with our show when we're live. Of course,

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.000
we love our podcast folks as well, and they,

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000
you always can interact with us, uh, delayed

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000
a little bit over on Twitter, twitter.com

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000
slash o-l-r, and you can also do that, uh,

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000
maybe through Facebook or through our email bag.

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.000
Participate at orangelandtrader.com.

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000
But, uh, when you're broadcasting on Twitch,

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000
you can interact in real time, and more and more

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000
games are starting to think about how can we

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000
kind of incorporate that into our game,

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000
and Borderlands 3.

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000
Which looks amazing, by the way. Yeah, they had a big

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000
reveal this week, right? They had the gameplay reveal,

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000
and I'm totally in day one.

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.000
That looks all sorts of awesome.

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.000
I have to admit, I did not watch the gameplay reveal

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000
yet, because I'm still making my way through the other

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000
ga- I mean, I know a gameplay reveal's not gonna

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000
give anything away, but I just, you know, I'm just focused

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000
on trying to get through the original games,

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000
uh, before this comes out.

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.000
But, uh, yeah, I'm excited for

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000
folks that are into this series, and now I see

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000
why people enjoy Borderlands. I get it.

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000
Um, anyhow, uh, so

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.000
during the, uh, Borderlands 3

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000
reveal, they talked about an extension called

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000
the EchoCast. So if you

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000
use this extension, apparently,

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000
um, you can- the viewers can

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000
look at the streamer's loadouts,

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000
look at what's in the backpacks.

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.000
So through the extension, I guess you could

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000
probably click on something on the view window, and even if I'm

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000
not looking at my inventory at this minute, you can look at

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000
my inventory on your- your

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000
Twitch screen, because that's how the extensions

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.000
kind of work, right? I don't know if we use any

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000
extensions on, um, VOG Network's

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000
channel. I don't- Bobby would have to

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000
refresh my memory. I don't think so,

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000
because we're not really playing games here.

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000
Um, but a lot of the more traditional

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000
Twitch extensions, there's things like,

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.000
um, you know, you can interact with the streamer,

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.000
maybe play noises, or, you know, sometimes you can

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.000
affect what's going on in the game. My favorites

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000
are, like, I was watching the other- Mixer does this a lot,

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.000
too. I watched the other day, there's a guy

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000
that, um, he has, like, a currency

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000
that they can earn by playing different

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000
games in chat, and then they spend that

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000
currency on putting cheats in Grand Theft Auto,

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.000
so they can put cheats in

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000
to hurt or, you know, help the

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000
player, and it's all sorts of

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000
craziness. Yeah, this, uh, Tomb Raider

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000
reboot had something like that in, like, the

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000
multiplayer or something, where, like, that your

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000
Twitch chat could affect what's going on.

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000
So, I mean, we've heard about games, you know,

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000
kind of interacting with Twitch, but anyway, uh, also

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000
there will be special loot chests throughout

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000
the game. If a streamer opens them,

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000
you can opt into a challenge called

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000
the Rare Chest Event. This

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000
means the viewer would get a copy

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000
of whatever the streamer

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.000
gets. It's kind of, I like

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.000
that, that's kind of interesting. It would be a

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.000
shift code, I guess, that would be given out, and

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.000
scaled to the viewer's level when you redeem it in

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.000
your own game. So, interesting.

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.000
Um, the gameplay reveal,

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.000
I guess the EchoCast extension was, uh,

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000
coincided with that, so if you were

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000
watching the Borderlands 3

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.000
reveal, you kind of get an idea how that works,

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000
which I missed out on, but, uh, did they, did they

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000
actually have that going during the gameplay? I didn't watch

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.000
it on Twitch, so I don't know. So,

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.000
interesting, though. I think that's really cool.

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.000
Um, I like how more games are thinking about

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000
how can we, like, really embrace this streaming

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000
thing, and, like, do our own stuff

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000
with it. I think that's really cool.

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000
So, uh, yeah.

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000
S2100Matt says, uh, this opens the door

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.000
for people to judge other people's inventory.

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000
I tend to be a massive hoarder in games like this.

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.000
I would imagine that you could turn it off,

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.000
I suppose, if you wanted to. Maybe.

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000
I don't know. Anyway, let's move on.

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.000
DarkSakura, what do you have for us? Well,

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.000
there is a video game hall of fame.

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000
Of course, we know about this one, among

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.000
other ones, but we're talking about the

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000
nice, legit one.

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000
You know what I mean by legit, right?

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000
Uh, meaning

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000
non-pirated, I guess.

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.000
Well, no, meaning that it's actually

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.000
a pretty big one.

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.000
So, uh, this year,

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000
the, um, the,

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.000
uh, it's the Strong's

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000
World Video Game Hall of Fame.

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.000
So, uh,

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.000
the, uh, games that are being included

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.000
are, duh duh duh,

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.000
uh, Mortal Kombat,

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.000
which, it's got a deserving

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.000
place. Um, Super Mario Kart,

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000
uh, also,

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.000
um, Colossal

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.000
Cave Adventure, and get this,

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.000
Windows Solitaire.

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.000
Then again, I get that.

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.000
How much of us wasted so much time

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:22.000
on that? Seriously? Windows Solitaire

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.000
was a game for filthy casuals.

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.000
Um, filthy casuals, really?

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.000
Even, you know what I mean. Yeah.

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.000
It's a joke. But, and all

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000
joking aside, um, Solitaire, and I

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.000
feel like this just came up on the show a few weeks ago,

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.000
Solitaire's a great game for developing motor skills.

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:38.000
Like, if you are, you know, maybe

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000
older and haven't used computers an awful lot,

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.000
Solitaire is a great way to learn.

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.000
I reckon. It's just,

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000
it's never... I've used that in my professional life.

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.000
That's all why I kind of bring that up.

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.000
Somebody who's a little less comfortable with computers, I'll say,

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.000
have you played Solitaire at home? You should think about it.

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.000
Okay. Well, it does

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.000
get you kind of into the point and click

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.000
mentality. Yes. You know, which I guess

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.000
for people doing, like, data entry

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.000
or something, that might be

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000
worthwhile. But I just think it's very

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.000
interesting that it's finally being

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.000
recognized. That instead of just

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.000
being, you know, bloating software

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.000
for Microsoft Windows,

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.000
it's a mainstay. On top

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.000
of that, with this picture, it's got, like, the same

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.000
monitor that Dan and I had when I first moved in

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.000
with him. This little dinky

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.000
computer monitor. That's pretty funny.

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.000
Um, you know, but the

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.000
other thing about Colossal Adventure is that,

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.000
you know, Colossal Cave Adventure, sorry,

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:30.000
is that it was also a cassette

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.000
game. So, you know,

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.000
but the other games that were,

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.000
uh... Sorry,

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.000
the Colossal Cave Adventure, that's a text adventure game, right?

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.000
Yeah. That predates Zork.

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.000
So it's kind of like your text adventure

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000
representation, right? Yeah, it's like

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.000
your intro to all things text.

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.000
Can you read? You can play it. I think that was

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.000
one of the first, yeah. And I think that's why it's

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.000
noteworthy. But the other thing is

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:54.000
that there were some other games that were in the

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000
list of finalists, but did not

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.000
make it, including, those were

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.000
Candy Crush Saga,

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:02.000
Centipede,

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.000
DDR, Half-Life,

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.000
Myst, NBA 2K, Sid Meier

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.000
Civilization, and Super Smash Brothers

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.000
Melee. Here's the thing. Shouldn't a game

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.000
have to be out for at least 10 years

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.000
before we start thinking about the Video Game

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.000
Hall of Fame? Like, when it comes to Candy Crush.

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.000
Because I would say a game like Mortal Combat,

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.000
I think if we had evaluated

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.000
whether it belonged in a Video Game Hall of Fame

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.000
in 1995, or whatever year that game came

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.000
out, or even one or two years after it was out,

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.000
I'm not so sure we would think that

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:30.000
that game is going to end up in the Hall of Fame someday.

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.000
Because of how controversial it was. What are my

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.000
rules for classic game?

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000
Yes. But you're not

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.000
curating this museum, unfortunately.

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.000
I'll curate a museum. And it's basically

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.000
going to be Mass Effect

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000
and Sega games.

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000
Which, if you go to the classic

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.000
game of the week list, is similar to what

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.000
she did. No, I have Compile

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.000
because of Guardian Legend.

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000
Okay, sorry. One exception.

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.000
Bitch, don't doubt me.

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.000
Hearts. But anyhow,

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.000
that's cool. And I see in our chat,

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000
SD100Matt says, I keep meaning to go to this place.

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.000
My girlfriend has family in Rochester

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.000
and we're up there often. Hey, if you go,

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.000
take video. Take a ton of it.

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.000
Bring us a souvenir.

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.000
I'd be curious. Anyway.

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000
And then ship me some Waffle House Grits.

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000
Metal Mayhem in chat says, didn't cassette

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000
games have horrendous accessing and low

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.000
times? Oh, absolutely.

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000
Absolutely, they did. Well, on top of that,

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.000
I'm sure I've spoken ad nauseam about the problems

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.000
with the Coleco Atom. That anytime you

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.000
had a power surge, it would erase your cassettes.

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.000
Right. But the thing about it,

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.000
I mean, the cassette was what existed

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.000
before the disc, which existed

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.000
before the CD, which is ironic. The audio

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.000
is also used, kind of, two of those

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.000
forms. To be fair,

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.000
there were 11 inch floppies

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.000
and 13 inch floppies

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.000
around the same time that cassette

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.000
became a viable

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.000
storage media.

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.000
And I think cassette was just

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.000
you know, like, again, there was

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:56.000
no way to, like, have

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.000
a pre-installed game

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.000
that you could put on your system

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.000
or what have you without, like, typing

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.000
it in if it weren't for cassette or disc.

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.000
Yeah. You either programmed

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.000
that shit in BASIC or

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.000
you, I mean, well,

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.000
in computers for production

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.000
at the time, we're still, some of them

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.000
were actually still using Fortran and punch cards.

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.000
So, there you go.

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:20.000
Yeah. So,

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:22.000
it is kind of interesting, though, how tapes kind of went to CD

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:24.000
later on, but anyway. So,

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.000
okay, there you go. Additions to the Video Game Hall of Fame.

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:28.000
It's a decent selection.

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.000
I mean, when you hear some of the games, they omit it.

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.000
Of course, my fanboy is going, what?

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.000
No Civilization? They couldn't, Mortal

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.000
Combat couldn't wait another year for Civilization? I knew that would make you

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.000
sad. I know, a little bit, but

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.000
I can't, like, look at any of those games

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.000
they picked and say it doesn't deserve it.

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.000
Yeah, they all deserve

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.000
their place in there. They all deserve it in their own way.

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.000
Like, even if you kind of look at Solitaire

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.000
and go, huh? Like, again, you have to look

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.000
at, what did it do for gaming the big

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.000
picture as opposed to just gaming for the

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.000
hardcore audience? Seriously, that is exactly

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.000
it. I mean, although, I

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.000
must say, the thing that disappoints me

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.000
is that DDR isn't included.

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.000
Sure. Because DDR, for

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.000
itself, was actually fairly revolutionary

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:08.000
for genres. Well, it created

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.000
a genre, practically. Well, Beatmania

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.000
really did. DDR is why we're

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.000
here.

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.000
If it were me, I would put Beatmania in before

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.000
DDR, because we wouldn't have DDR without

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.000
Beatmania.

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.000
Or Spiderstomp. Here's the thing, though. Here's what's

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.000
ultimately going to happen, because this is based in

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:26.000
America, and it's a Murica

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:28.000
thing. I think DDR

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:30.000
was more known here than Beatmania.

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:32.000
Which, to be fair, is Konami's own damn

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:34.000
fault, because they released it here as Hip-Hop

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:36.000
Mania, and it wasn't really the same kind of thing.

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.000
And they did that, I think, after DDR.

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.000
Yeah, and they never tried

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.000
the five key releases here and that stuff

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.000
until way later.

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:46.000
So, I mean, DDR is what

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.000
people know here. My first exposure was

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.000
BM98. Sure,

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.000
but you also go

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.000
to anime conventions,

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.000
which is not, you know... Well, at the time, I did.

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.000
At the time.

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.000
Alright, well, let's move on, and

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:02.000
let's get to our next story,

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:04.000
which is from Loki.

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:06.000
Alright, so this has

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.000
got me very excited, even though we know

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:10.000
no details about this yet, and

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.000
there's a good chance that they're going to fuck it up.

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:14.000
But you're still going to pre-order your ticket.

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:16.000
Oh, yeah, seriously.

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.000
So Saints Row the Movie is something that's going to be

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:20.000
worked on, and apparently

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:22.000
right now, they've

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.000
got a director attached,

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.000
director F. Gary Gray,

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:28.000
who is, I guess, working

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:30.000
on, or he had worked on The Fate of the Furious

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:32.000
and the upcoming Men in Black

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:34.000
International. And then, of course,

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:36.000
Greg Russo is going to be

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.000
writing

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:40.000
the treatment as well, and he's

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:42.000
rebooting the Mortal Kombat franchise

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.000
in the movie forms.

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:46.000
And, yeah, so that's

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.000
about all we know about it right now. I'm assuming

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.000
this is something that's going to be

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.000
coming way later on.

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.000
They've got to have Daniel

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:56.000
Dae Kim as Gat, because that's really the only

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:58.000
way I'd want to see that.

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:00.000
And what

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:02.000
the hell? Let's just put Troy Baker in there

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:04.000
as well as the

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:06.000
boss, because that'd be awesome.

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:08.000
What do you want to see in a Saints Row movie?

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:10.000
I want to see fucking crazy shit, but being that it's

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:12.000
The Fate of the Furious, that movie is pretty

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:14.000
over the top as it was.

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:16.000
So let's just, like,

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:18.000
take that. Let's take the

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:20.000
new Fast and the Furious

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:22.000
spin-off movie that they have coming out pretty soon.

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:24.000
Take all of that stuff

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:26.000
and just say,

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:28.000
tell the director,

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:30.000
do whatever the fuck you want.

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.000
Just go as crazy as you want

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.000
and make it... It doesn't even have to be believable.

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.000
Just go fucking nuts, and then that would

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:38.000
be perfect. Tigerclaw in chat asks,

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:40.000
will the Saints Row movie

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:42.000
have the self-awareness and meta-humor?

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.000
If it doesn't,

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:46.000
I hope they don't make it.

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.000
It needs to, like, seriously.

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:50.000
I don't think

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:52.000
they should directly adapt one of the games,

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:54.000
but Saints Row 3, again, I cannot

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:56.000
stress this enough. I was laughing

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:58.000
so hard during the opening moments

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:00.000
of Saints Row 3. Like, I was

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:02.000
crying. Like, it's just, like,

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:04.000
the game is so fucking funny.

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:06.000
And my character, you know,

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:08.000
I had, like, a female character that

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:10.000
was, like, falling through planes

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.000
and stuff like that. Like, the opening is just ridiculous.

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:14.000
And I'm just like, this game is

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:16.000
so, so stupid.

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.000
I love it. I love it.

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:20.000
Yes, I want that.

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:22.000
I want that, too. So stupid that

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:24.000
it's amazing. Make that bad

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:26.000
Sonic movie that Loki wants to see.

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:28.000
But Saints Row, put

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:30.000
Jim Carrey in the Saints Row movie.

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:32.000
Is there a part for him in there?

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:34.000
Not really, but, um, but yeah,

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:36.000
just, like, over the top. Like, there's plenty of

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:38.000
movies that are kind of over the top.

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:40.000
I mean, many in the Fast and the Furious

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:42.000
franchise. I mean, they're just, like, the whole

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:44.000
Fast and the Furious thing, which is over

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:46.000
the top. But that, that's

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:48.000
why it was good, you know?

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:50.000
I just don't want them to do, like, a cheap

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:52.000
just, like, this is gonna be kind of, like,

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:54.000
Fast and the Furious.

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:56.000
But, I don't know, like,

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:58.000
Gat is such a great character, it's gonna be hard to

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:00.000
find some, if they recast him, it's gonna be

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:02.000
hard to, like, get that character right.

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.000
The boss can be who, that's

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.000
gonna be the hard part, is the boss, because

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:08.000
who's it gonna be? Because

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:10.000
it can be pretty much anybody.

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:12.000
Um, I don't know. Metal Mayhem in

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:14.000
Chats is a Saints Row movie needs to have a gun,

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:16.000
dubstep gun and a giant purple

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:18.000
dildo bat. Honestly, cosigned.

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:20.000
Like, that might surprise you that I'm saying

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:22.000
that, but those are the things- And Professor

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:24.000
Genki. Those are the things that make Saints

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:26.000
Row, like, fucking stupid.

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:28.000
But, like, in that really funny way.

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:30.000
You know what I mean? And this is perfect for, like,

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:32.000
that really stupid action movie

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:34.000
genre, where it's like, you'll make it,

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:36.000
it'll be fucking stupid, and it'll make

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:38.000
tons of money, and they'll make more and more,

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:40.000
and it'll be, whatever.

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.000
Uh, Bonds 006

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:44.000
says, Saints Row film, a very bad

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:46.000
over-the-top Deadpool sans Ryan

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:48.000
Reynolds. Deadpool? Honestly, maybe

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:50.000
Deadpool is a good thing to

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:52.000
kinda look at for how to do this. Oh my god.

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:54.000
Yeah. I'm cosigning

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:56.000
Ryan Reynolds as the

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:58.000
boss for the Saints Row movie.

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:00.000
Hell yes. I don't,

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:02.000
the man can only do so much, but

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:04.000
I, that would be amazing

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:06.000
if he did. Wasn't Ryan Reynolds supposed to be

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:08.000
doing, like, the Clue movie at some point? I don't know.

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:10.000
He can do everything. He signed on to all those board game

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:12.000
movies or something? Whatever happened to that?

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:14.000
Development hell, I guess.

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:16.000
But yes, Daniel Dae Kim and Ryan

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:18.000
Reynolds. They're saying Keith David is the

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:20.000
narrator. Well, Keith, Keith

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:22.000
David's supposed, yeah.

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.000
He's just supposed to be Julius, so.

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:26.000
Uh, SD100Matt says that Hobbs and

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:28.000
Shaw movie looks ridiculous, I'm concerned. Exactly.

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:30.000
Keep that level of ridiculousness

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:32.000
and over-the-top, you know.

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:34.000
It just, just keep it going. Yeah.

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:36.000
Alright. Uh, anyhow,

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:38.000
let's move on. Uh, got another story here

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:40.000
before we get to our classic game of the week, and this is

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:42.000
about a classic game of sorts.

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:44.000
Earthworm Jim has a new game in

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:46.000
development for the new Intellivision

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.000
Amico, which, of course, as we know,

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:50.000
is coming out in the year 2020. I still don't like those controllers.

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:52.000
I get it. Like, I don't like

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:54.000
them. Yeah. I hope they have

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:56.000
traditional controllers as well. Yeah.

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:58.000
I'm sorry to call this out on air, but make sure when you do this, uh,

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:00.000
it's away from the mic, because remember the new mics are super sensitive,

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:02.000
so it's picking up the bags. Sorry.

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:04.000
And I was sitting on the mic.

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:06.000
Anyway, um, so, uh,

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:08.000
the new Intellivision, of course, is coming out, uh,

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:10.000
what, 10.10.2020, and, uh,

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:12.000
Earthworm Jim hasn't had a game

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.000
since, what, 95? So they're making

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:16.000
a new one. Oh, no, there was a high, uh,

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:18.000
there was an HD remake. They did do that.

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:20.000
Yeah. Yeah, but not as a

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:22.000
proper sequel. So, uh, the

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:24.000
original team members are participating

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:26.000
in this, uh, including Doug

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:28.000
to Naples, which, um,

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:30.000
he's a character. We'll put it that way. My

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:32.000
understanding is that, uh, he is

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:34.000
doing it on a volunteer basis, so if you're

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:36.000
worried about possibly

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:38.000
money and all that stuff, it sounds like

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:40.000
that is, it's gonna be a little easier to

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:42.000
separate the art from the artist in this, this

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:44.000
particular circumstance because he's volunteering,

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:46.000
which is kind of interesting,

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:48.000
um, but cool, I guess.

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:50.000
And, of course, Tommy Tallarico, he did the music

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:52.000
and the soundtrack before, uh,

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.000
so, uh, he's gonna be doing that again,

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:56.000
of course. And what a coinkydink

01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:58.000
that Tommy Tallarico is playing such

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:00.000
a role as the CEO

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:02.000
of Intellivision, so it kind

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:04.000
of makes sense why this game is

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:06.000
the one that they're bringing back. Um,

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:08.000
I was interested, though, when

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:10.000
I saw a lot of the comments on this

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:12.000
about how, well, looks

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:14.000
like I'm not playing Earthworm Jim

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:16.000
because they're putting it on this trash console

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:18.000
and, well, I'm just, uh, fuck

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:20.000
exclusivity agreements, I'm not gonna play it.

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:22.000
Well, they don't know what... And I'm just kind of like,

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:24.000
oh, shut up. Like,

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:26.000
do y'all know what business is?

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:28.000
Because if, if the Amico wasn't

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:30.000
trying to get some exclusives and some games

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:32.000
that are, like, kind of like must-haves or must-tries,

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:34.000
then you all would shit on the

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:36.000
Amico for not having any games worth playing.

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:38.000
So, like, this kind of goes back

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:40.000
to the beginning. I just don't know about the controllers, though.

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:42.000
Like, I know, I don't remember,

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:44.000
you know, the

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:46.000
ColecoVision too fondly, and I know the Intellivision

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:48.000
stuff's kind of similar. Um,

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:50.000
I don't know. I just,

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:52.000
I have a hard time imagining how that's gonna

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:54.000
work, but I'm sure it'll make it work.

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:56.000
Bobby is pointing out you saw a render, but not

01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:58.000
the actual controller, so. Right. There's still time

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:00.000
for things to change based on fan feedback.

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:02.000
Perhaps.

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:04.000
Uh, Metal Mayhem says, so long as the new

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:06.000
Earthworm Jim is like the first two games, not Earthworm Jim 3D,

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:08.000
I'll be happy. I think it's a safe

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:10.000
bet to say it's gonna be like the first two games that you remember.

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:12.000
Yeah, I think that's what they're going for in this

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:14.000
console. It's supposed to be all 2D stuff, isn't it?

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:16.000
Uh, yeah, I think so.

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:18.000
Uh, Dartusuya says, I know Tommy made a

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:20.000
comment going to bat for him, whatever it's worth,

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:22.000
but I do hope he does a good soundtrack for this game.

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:24.000
Um, and it's also interesting to point out,

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:26.000
you know, for, whether you

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:28.000
hate the exclusiveness or not,

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:30.000
remember Intellivision has very

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:32.000
firmly said games will cost

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:34.000
at most, what, ten bucks? I think it was actually

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:36.000
under that, it was like eight bucks.

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:38.000
So that means, I would assume

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:40.000
Earthworm Jim is going to be no different.

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:42.000
It's going to be like an eight dollar game.

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:44.000
So, interesting.

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:46.000
I, I just. Yeah, I'd be curious to see

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:48.000
what happens when it comes out.

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:50.000
You know, it's, it's interesting to see how

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:52.000
the Intellivision is coming into its own.

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:54.000
And I'll be very curious to see more

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:56.000
moves like this about what, what kind of

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:58.000
games are they really going to bring to the table

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:00.000
as we approach 2020 and the

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:02.000
release. You know, we still have over a year to go, a year

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:04.000
and a half to go before we get to October

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:06.000
of 2020. So I'll be very curious to

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:08.000
see what more develops in the coming months.

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:10.000
So.

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:12.000
All right. As Joe and I, Matt, points

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:14.000
out, the main thing is they're taking their time.

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:16.000
And Bobby Blackwolf pointing

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:18.000
out they're not targeting people who would use pro controllers,

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:20.000
they're targeting mobile users.

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:22.000
We'll see. I am,

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:24.000
I, I'll give it a chance. Let's, let's

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:26.000
a lot of this is still

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:28.000
hypothesis and theory. And that's,

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:30.000
and that's fine. I like like,

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:32.000
and I'm fine with the controllers

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:34.000
being the way they are. I just hope that they

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:36.000
have the forethought to like, we'll have

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:38.000
Bluetooth and you bring your own damn controller

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:40.000
if you want, you know, that, that's fine.

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:42.000
Um, would be nice. I'm not saying they

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:44.000
have to do it the way everybody

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:46.000
else is doing it, but I

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:48.000
mean, if I have my choice between,

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:50.000
you know, using the

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:52.000
type of controls I would on a mobile game

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:54.000
versus an actual controller, I'm

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:56.000
going to choose an actual controller.

01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:58.000
We will see. There's still a long way to go.

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:00.000
Anyway, before we get to

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:02.000
the release of Earthworm Jim, we're going to take

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:04.000
a trip down memory lane and

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:06.000
visit the classic game of the week. Every

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:08.000
week here on the show, Dark Soccer steps into the

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:10.000
gaming vault and tries to find a game that she thinks,

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:12.000
hey, you kids, you should be checking this

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:14.000
one out. This is a classic, y'all.

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:16.000
We do talk about this one a lot. Yes.

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:18.000
So, uh, yeah, we have brought this game up a few

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:20.000
times. So, uh, and it's not a Sega game.

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:22.000
Nope. It is an absolute

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:24.000
Nintendo game. So what

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:26.000
is the classic game of the week? Clu Clu Land,

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:28.000
which came out in

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:30.000
1984 in Japan

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:32.000
and, uh,

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:34.000
just under a year later in the

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:36.000
U.S. and, uh, so in Japan it came out November

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:38.000
22nd, 1984, and in the

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:40.000
U.S. it came out October 18th, 1985,

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:42.000
and then, uh, in 87

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:44.000
in, uh, Europe.

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:46.000
So Clu Clu Land, first of

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:48.000
all, people are like, what does this have

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:50.000
to do with, uh, is it Clu

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:52.000
from Tron? What? Um, no.

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:54.000
It actually is

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:56.000
an, uh, Anglicization

01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:58.000
of, uh, the Japanese title

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:00.000
Kuru Kuru, um,

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:02.000
you know, uh, it was Kuru Kuru Land,

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:04.000
which basically, Kuru Kuru is an

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:06.000
onomatopoeia that means around and around.

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:08.000
Uh, or you

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:10.000
might have also heard Guru Guru, you know, same

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:12.000
thing. Um, so basically

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:14.000
the main character has to grab poles

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:16.000
and swing around, so that's where it comes

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:18.000
from. It's the same, uh,

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:20.000
uh, kind of title for the Game Boy

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:22.000
romance game, uh, Kuru Kuru Kururin.

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:24.000
So, anyway, um,

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:26.000
in Clu Clu Land you play

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:28.000
a balloon fish named Bubbles in the U.S.

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:30.000
She was Gloopy in Japan, which I think

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:32.000
Gloopy's a funnier name. Um,

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:34.000
she swims around in a maze trying

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:36.000
to uncover these gold ingots.

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:38.000
Um, so

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:40.000
you basically,

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:42.000
um, are fighting

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:44.000
this sea urchin

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:46.000
called Unira, who

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:48.000
is stealing all of the treasures

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:50.000
in the underwater kingdom of Clu Clu Land.

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:52.000
So Bubbles has to retrieve

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:54.000
all the treasure and spin around and gather all

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:56.000
the gold ingots, um,

01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:58.000
and...

01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:00.000
The rupees.

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:02.000
They look like rupees.

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:04.000
Well, that's because they reuse all the

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:06.000
things anyway. But at any

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:08.000
rate, um, it is,

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:10.000
uh,

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:12.000
um, you know, she,

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:14.000
if she gets attacked by an Unira

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:16.000
then she'll lose a life. Um,

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:18.000
she can also, though,

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:20.000
uh, stun an Unira by using

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:22.000
a sound, uh, a sound wave.

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:24.000
Um,

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:26.000
you can also lose your life if you fall into a

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:28.000
black hole or when the time runs out. And

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:30.000
of course, you run out of all lives, it's

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:32.000
game over. Um,

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:34.000
and then sometimes you have to

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:36.000
pass over the ingots in an

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:38.000
odd number to uncover them.

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:40.000
And, cause they will go between

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:42.000
their uncovered side and

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:44.000
a dull side. You know, it's kind of like

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:46.000
how, uh, um,

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:48.000
Qbert goes in later levels where you have to do double jumps

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:50.000
on some of the items. Um,

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:52.000
there was, um,

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:54.000
other versions that came out. There was a

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:56.000
versus Clu Clu Land. Have you guys ever seen one?

01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:58.000
Oh god, I

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:00.000
think I did once. I do

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:02.000
remember, like a multi-versus

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:04.000
machine and I think Clu Clu Land was one of them

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:06.000
cause I kind of made fun of it. That's how I saw

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:08.000
my first versus Clu Clu Land. It was

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:10.000
at a Godfather's Pizza in Mobile, Alabama.

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:12.000
Um,

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:14.000
so, of course, you know, released

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:16.000
for the coin-op Nintendo versus system.

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:18.000
It had twice as many

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:20.000
puzzles

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:22.000
in a new

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:24.000
enemy called Boss Unira.

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:26.000
Um, different level themes and some other

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:28.000
features. Um,

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:30.000
and a port of this one was

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:32.000
released as

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:34.000
the final game for

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:36.000
the Famicom Disk System

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:38.000
as called Clu Clu Land.

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:40.000
Welcome to New Clu Clu Land.

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:42.000
Um, the

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:44.000
NES version and the

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:46.000
Famicom Disk System version are

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:48.000
both unlockable in

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:50.000
Game, uh, in Animal

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:52.000
Crossing, the one on GameCube.

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:54.000
Um, that was retitled

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:56.000
as Clu Clu Land D

01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:58.000
outside of Japan. Um,

01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:00.000
other ports in 2001, there

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:02.000
was a port to the Sharp Zaris

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:04.000
PDA.

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:06.000
Um, we had, uh, in

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:08.000
2004, it was released

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:10.000
on the Famicom

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:12.000
Mini for Game Boy Advance.

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:14.000
Um, Bubbles

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:16.000
was also a trophy in Super Smash

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:18.000
Brothers Melee. And the Clu Clu

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:20.000
Land NES music and

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:22.000
the Unira enemy are

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:24.000
items in Super Smash Brothers Brawl.

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:26.000
And, of course, they

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:28.000
also re-return as items in

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:30.000
Super Smash Brothers Ultimate.

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:32.000
Um, she's also,

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:34.000
uh, in a

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:36.000
secret level of the

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:38.000
Game Boy Advance game, DK King of Swing,

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:40.000
which was

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:42.000
pretty much inspired by Clu Clu Land.

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:44.000
Um, there's a

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:46.000
microgame of Clu Clu Land in

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:48.000
WarioWare Smooth Moves for Wii.

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:50.000
And, um,

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:52.000
Clu Clu Land's

01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:54.000
Nintendo microgame in Mario

01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:56.000
Twisted. Uh, the

01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:58.000
rupee from the Legend of Zelda series was modeled

01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:00.000
after the Inkot sprite from

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:02.000
Clu Clu Land.

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:04.000
That money bag also looked like the money bag that was in

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:06.000
Legend of Zelda Link to...

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:08.000
or, uh, Adventures of Link.

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:10.000
And they also said that the Dig Dogger enemy

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:12.000
from, uh, Legend of Zelda

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:14.000
series was basically based

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:16.000
off of the Unira. Um,

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:18.000
of course, Clu Clu Land is also one of the games

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:20.000
included in NES remix.

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:22.000
And there you have it.

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:24.000
All right. Kuru Kuru Land.

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:26.000
Your classic game of the week, a game

01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:28.000
that, uh, some of you in chat are like,

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:30.000
I never really understood how this game works. What is this?

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:32.000
What is this that's being drawn on stream right now?

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:34.000
Glasses. Yep.

01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:36.000
How about that?

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:38.000
Cause, I mean, a lot of them just were like, you know, little

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:40.000
puzzles. Once you figured out

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:42.000
what the puzzle piece was, then

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:44.000
it was really easy to go in

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:46.000
and figure out how

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:48.000
to swing around them. Yeah.

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:50.000
It's kind of like, um, it's kind of like that game, uh,

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:52.000
Anticipation. Once you've played it enough,

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:54.000
that little pencil draws, like, two lines

01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:56.000
and you know what the answer is.

01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:58.000
Ain't no Anticipa-

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:00.000
Yeah. It makes that game a whole lot, uh,

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:02.000
less fun at that point. I was trying to do

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:04.000
a Rocky joke. I know. I know.

01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:06.000
All right. Uh, thank you for that classic game of the week

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:08.000
selection. Um, speaking of classic games,

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:10.000
uh, we have a contribution this week

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:12.000
for our little, uh, break segment here we do in the

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:14.000
middle of the show. And it is from, uh,

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:16.000
our pal Bobby Blackwolf,

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:18.000
who went to a classic game show in Atlanta last week

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:20.000
and found this really cool,

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:22.000
uh, TI 99

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:24.000
4A. Y'all remember that computer?

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:26.000
I think I had one. I had two.

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:28.000
I, I didn't- I did it as a classic system

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:30.000
remember? You did. That's right. You did do a

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:32.000
classic system. Well get this. So what he's about

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:34.000
to show us is Dragon's

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:36.000
Lair, the 80s game

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:38.000
running on a TI 99

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:40.000
4A. What? And I, I don't mean

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:42.000
like some scaled down port

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:44.000
cause there was like a Commodore 64 version of Dragon's Lair

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:46.000
but it was completely different. How much RAM do they have to put

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:48.000
in this thing to make it work? Well, we're about

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:50.000
to find out. So why don't we turn it over to Bobby

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:52.000
and find out.

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:54.000
Hello, Orange Lounge Radio. Bobby

01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:56.000
Blackwolf here. Uh, I know I'm

01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:58.000
usually on a couple hours ago

01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:00.000
but Rob really likes having

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:02.000
content in the middle of the show and I'm here at the Vintage

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:04.000
Computer Festival Southeast

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:06.000
7.0 in Roswell, Georgia and

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:08.000
uh, I saw a game that

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:10.000
uh, is not a classic

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:12.000
game of the week because it was just released

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:14.000
but it's for really old

01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:16.000
systems and it's a really old game.

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:18.000
So I have Alan here. Alan,

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:20.000
what am I looking at here?

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:22.000
You are looking at Dragon's Lair for the

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:24.000
Texas Instruments TI 99

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:26.000
for a home computer. And this is

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:28.000
obviously the side-scrolling platformer

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:30.000
that was released on the NES, right?

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:32.000
Uh, I got something to do.

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:34.000
No, absolutely not. This is an

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:36.000
actual conversion. This is a

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:38.000
fully licensed conversion of Dragon's

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:40.000
Lair made by Harmless Lion

01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:42.000
and he took the high

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:44.000
definition video and audio

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:46.000
from the PC release in

01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:48.000
I think it was the early 2000s

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:50.000
digitized it with his own software including

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:52.000
the video and the audio and then produced

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:54.000
the game out of it. He took 80

01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:56.000
megabytes of data, crammed

01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:58.000
it into this little cartridge that gets banked

01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:00.000
in 8K chunks

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:02.000
and it's

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:04.000
fully playable.

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:06.000
And I have been playing it and it's

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:08.000
just as unforgiving

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:10.000
as I remember. But you

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:12.000
really don't have like a laser displayer hiding

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:14.000
under here, right? You're not doing like video trickery?

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:16.000
No, no. Those are actually a little bit too expensive for my

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:18.000
budget. So,

01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:20.000
how long do you, like, what's

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:22.000
the backstory behind this? Like, how long did it take

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:24.000
him to do it?

01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:26.000
I want to say it took him at least a couple

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:28.000
of years to work on it but he's been actually building

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:30.000
the fundamentals for a couple of

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:32.000
decades.

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:34.000
If you've

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:36.000
been in the Atariage forums at all

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:38.000
in the TI sub forums of Atariage

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:40.000
you'll see where he's put up some

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:42.000
demos here and there of sampled audio,

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:44.000
sampled video. One of his

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:46.000
first ones actually was Spaceballs

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:48.000
that he did on a, I think it was a 4

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:50.000
megabyte cartridge. And

01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:52.000
he says that this was his

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:54.000
target game. This was one of the games he always wanted

01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:56.000
to do and he spent all this time

01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:58.000
getting the process perfected

01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:00.000
so he could produce it. So is

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:02.000
this an unmodified TI-99

01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:04.000
or is this running any expansion boards that you're running it on here?

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:06.000
No, this is a completely stock

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:08.000
unexpanded TI-99 4A

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:10.000
console. That means there's no 32K,

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:12.000
it does not have the F18A

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:14.000
replacement

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:16.000
for the video processor. It's completely

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:18.000
stock as if you opened the box

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:20.000
in 1983.

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:22.000
So do you know, is he worried about

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:24.000
any takedowns like whoever owns

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:26.000
the Dragon's Lair IP? Because we just saw

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:28.000
the Super Mario Brothers Commodore 64

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:30.000
conversion and apparently Nintendo

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:32.000
sent a cease and desist once it hit the

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:34.000
media sites. Has he been contacted

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:36.000
by anybody that owns the rights or do we even know

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:38.000
who has the Dragon's Lair rights right now?

01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:40.000
Well the rights to Dragon's Lair

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:42.000
is owned by a company called

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:44.000
Digital Leisure. I believe they're out of Canada

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:46.000
and he actually contacted them,

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:48.000
purchased a license and got their blessing

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:50.000
on this conversion

01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:52.000
of Dragon's Lair for the TI.

01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:54.000
That's awesome. So

01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:56.000
I know there's a boxed copy

01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:58.000
here and I know that you're giving it away but where can

01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:00.000
people find it if they can't get a boxed copy?

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:02.000
It's actually no longer available.

01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:04.000
He produced 155

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:06.000
cartridges and he was able to

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:08.000
ship all of his orders before the license expired

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:10.000
for production and at this point

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:12.000
there will never be another release of it.

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:14.000
No ROMs anywhere?

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:16.000
There are no ROMs anywhere and that has a lot

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:18.000
to do with the licensing and

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:20.000
plus it's just

01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:22.000
one of those things. It just kind of

01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:24.000
makes it a little bit more valuable

01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:26.000
that way. So if people want to play it they need

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:28.000
to come to like a vintage computer festival somewhere?

01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:30.000
At this point yes. The only way to play it is if

01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:32.000
you know somebody who has it.

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:34.000
Or if you win it here which I

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:36.000
competed and

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:38.000
got third to last.

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:40.000
Actually I think you're fourth to last.

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:42.000
I'm fourth to last now.

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:44.000
Today right now I do have

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:46.000
a fully boxed copy

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:48.000
completely unopened

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:50.000
ready for the winner today

01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:52.000
to take home with him. Right now

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:54.000
we have about 20 minutes left

01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:56.000
in the contest. We do have a top score

01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:58.000
winner by the name of JR

01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:00.000
just walking around here having a good time

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:02.000
waiting to take home his copy of Dragon's Lair.

01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:06.000
It was fun to play.

01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:08.000
I didn't do too well.

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:10.000
He claimed the controller.

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:12.000
But then he fixed the controller and I can't play again

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:14.000
because I've already played.

01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:16.000
So I can't compete again.

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:18.000
It runs on regular

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:20.000
Atari style

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:22.000
joystick and everything.

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:24.000
It is what it says it is.

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:26.000
It's really impressive.

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:28.000
I remember seeing a demo of this.

01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:30.000
You had just gotten a demo last year.

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:32.000
Yes. Last year at VCF

01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:34.000
I was able to obtain

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:36.000
the demo

01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:38.000
from Mike Brent, Tursi,

01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:40.000
Harmless Lion.

01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:42.000
I was able to show it here

01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:44.000
and had it playing.

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:46.000
It was quite amazing. A lot of people stopped by

01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:48.000
to take a look at it and we were really

01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:50.000
championing the bit to get the final release

01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:52.000
and we finally got it.

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:54.000
The technical achievement

01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:56.000
is absolutely amazing.

01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:58.000
Now remember I said that this is

01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:00.000
an unmodified TI-99-4A

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:02.000
but obviously an out of the

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:04.000
box cartridge

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:07.000
Is there some

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:09.000
hardware trickery that's going on

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:11.000
to actually make this work?

01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:13.000
There is absolutely some sorcery going on in here.

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:15.000
Mike Brent

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:17.000
he knows this hardware

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:19.000
inside and out.

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:21.000
This is an absolute masterpiece.

01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:23.000
A symphony of hardware and software.

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:25.000
It's more than just the program.

01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:27.000
It took a cartridge that had not been

01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:29.000
invented. It extends the banking

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:31.000
scheme of our cartridge port

01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:33.000
beyond what has ever been used.

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:35.000
The cartridge actually has the ability

01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:37.000
to hold 128 megabytes of

01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:39.000
data banked in 8K chunks.

01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:41.000
He has it loaded with 80 megabytes

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:43.000
of data right now for this game.

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:45.000
So Mike put

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:47.000
a lot of work, he's put a lot of time,

01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:49.000
blood, sweat and tears to make what is

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:51.000
an absolute masterpiece.

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:53.000
And I guess here's the question

01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:55.000
some people would ask

01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:57.000
is

01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:59.000
why

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:01.000
would someone go through that?

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:03.000
Why would someone do that?

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:05.000
Why not?

01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:07.000
Because it's there.

01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:09.000
If you have that one thing

01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:11.000
that you really really want to do

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:13.000
and you get the opportunity to do it

01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:15.000
you'd be a fool to pass it up.

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:17.000
Dragon's Lair

01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:19.000
on the TI-99-4A

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:21.000
hardware trickery

01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:23.000
but it's stock system

01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:25.000
and it does exactly what it says

01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:27.000
it does. So I'm going to send it back over to you Rob

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:29.000
over in the OLR studios. Maybe this will

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:31.000
be a classic game of the week in

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:33.000
10 years since it just came out

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:35.000
right now.

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:37.000
And we're looking at some footage there that

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:39.000
Bobby's closing the video up with. That looks

01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:41.000
great. I mean considering the hardware

01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:43.000
that it's on, that looks fantastic.

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:45.000
That's great. So thank you so much

01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:47.000
Bobby for picking that up and checking

01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:49.000
that out for us there. That looked

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:51.000
great. And I love that. I love the answer

01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:53.000
at the end there. Why do this?

01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:55.000
Why not?

01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:57.000
Well, I think

01:34:57.000 --> 01:34:59.000
that's a really good question.

01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:01.000
I think that's a really good question.

01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:03.000
I think that's a really good question.

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:05.000
Why not?

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:07.000
I love it. I think the moment that he said

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:09.000
that it was unmodified I was sort of like

01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:11.000
holy shit.

01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:13.000
Yeah. That's well done. Well done.

01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:15.000
Kudos to everybody involved with that because

01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:17.000
the person that was being interviewed there was not the creator.

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:19.000
Of course I'm sure you picked up there in the interview

01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:21.000
but I was representing the game and I just

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:23.000
I love

01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:25.000
people that will go to the great lengths to

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:27.000
kind of do those things and preserve

01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:29.000
the classics even if it's in these very

01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:31.000
like strange

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:33.000
ways. So super cool.

01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:35.000
And what you didn't see in that video is

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:37.000
that Bobby actually went out to the parking lot

01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:39.000
and keyed the car of the winner of

01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:41.000
that Dragon's Lair cartridge.

01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:43.000
So sorry to the oh no I'm obviously making

01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:45.000
all that up there. But good job Bobby

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:47.000
not getting last last place

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:49.000
in that contest.

01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:51.000
He was what? Fourth from last. What was the

01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:53.000
contest? Playing Dragon's Lair? I think he was trying to get a high

01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:55.000
score on that Dragon's Lair game. Yeah I would have lost that.

01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:57.000
If you're not used to playing it.

01:35:57.000 --> 01:35:59.000
Oh god. I did some contest a

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:01.000
long time ago. I think it was like Stampede on the

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:03.000
Atari 2600 at some. And it was like

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:05.000
the official Twin Galaxies

01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:07.000
ranking or something. I was like third from last place.

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:09.000
So I didn't know what the hell I was doing.

01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:11.000
But I thought it was cool because as I was doing it they were giving me

01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:13.000
tips on how to get better at it. So

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:15.000
it's kind of neat.

01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:17.000
The way you get

01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:19.000
the highest score is you fake

01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:21.000
your video or you

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:23.000
upload a fake score online and say that

01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:25.000
the video is gone. Now Bobby

01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:27.000
in chat says the guy who won the cartridge

01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:29.000
actually has the arcade cabinet

01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:31.000
so he knew everything. Well you know

01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:33.000
what? At least you know it's going to a good home.

01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:35.000
You know if somebody splurged the money for the

01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:37.000
arcade cabinet you know they're a fan of Dragon's

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:39.000
Lair and so you know what?

01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:41.000
It's going to go to a good home. And maybe something

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:43.000
you know I know we joke about

01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:45.000
could that be a classic game here in ten years

01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:47.000
on OLR the TI. I don't know if the

01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:49.000
original Dragon's Lair has surely been a

01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:51.000
classic game at some point. I don't know. I would think.

01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:53.000
But maybe not.

01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:55.000
Alright now do Space Ace.

01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:59.000
You know what really impressed me?

01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:01.000
Now you got to do Space Ace.

01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:03.000
No. Anyway.

01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:05.000
Thank you Bobby. Thank you for the segment

01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:07.000
and thank you for sharing that here on Orange

01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:09.000
Lounge Radio. Appreciate it. And if you guys have ideas for

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:11.000
a break segment here at Orange Lounge Radio

01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:13.000
we are all ears. You can reach

01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:15.000
out to me directly on Twitter if you want

01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:17.000
at Mr Rob Roberts. That's MR Rob Roberts.

01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:19.000
And of course you can always reach the

01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:21.000
show on Twitter as well at OLR. And there's

01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:23.000
always good old fashioned email. Participate

01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:25.000
at OrangeLoungeRadio.com

01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:27.000
In the meantime let's get

01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:29.000
to some rapid fire news and

01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:31.000
travel. Oh thank you. Bobby says he will

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:33.000
upload that to YouTube if the podcast

01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:35.000
audience wants to actually see what

01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:37.000
that looked like because you can hear the audio there

01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:39.000
especially at the end. You can only hear the audio and hear

01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:41.000
how you know again for a

01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:43.000
TI-9944A how

01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:45.000
faithful it is. But yeah hopefully

01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:47.000
you get to see that there. Thank you Bobby.

01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:49.000
Alright let's get into some rapid

01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:51.000
fire news and some quick other

01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:53.000
news that happened around the world this week.

01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:55.000
Yes. So let's talk a little

01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:57.000
bit about what's coming out for

01:37:57.000 --> 01:37:59.000
your free game. Well your

01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:01.000
games with paid subscription

01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:03.000
to online services.

01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:05.000
Not really free. I can't believe it's not free.

01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:07.000
Here's what's coming out

01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:09.000
on Xbox and on PlayStation.

01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:11.000
So Xbox One for May. We're

01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:13.000
getting Marooners from

01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:15.000
May 1st to the 31st and the Golf

01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:17.000
Club 2019 featuring PGA

01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:19.000
Tour from May 16th through the

01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:21.000
15th of June.

01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:23.000
And then

01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:25.000
on the Xbox 360

01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:27.000
which is also of course backwards compatible

01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:29.000
with Xbox One.

01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:31.000
Comic Jumper from May 16th

01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:33.000
to the 31st and last but not least

01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:35.000
Earth Defense Force Insect Armageddon on

01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:37.000
May 1st through the 15th. Definitely

01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:39.000
go check that out because it's awesome.

01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:41.000
It's a spin off but it's fun. I'll be sure

01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:43.000
to download that in your honor Loki since I

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:45.000
know you don't have an Xbox One but I do. But I

01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:47.000
have that game on my Xbox 360

01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:49.000
and I actually have that on PC too

01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:51.000
so you know.

01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:53.000
Like I would question it.

01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:55.000
Yes.

01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:57.000
And then of course this is pretty awesome but

01:38:57.000 --> 01:38:59.000
so

01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:01.000
For Honor they've got

01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:03.000
now of course since

01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:05.000
May the 4th was

01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:07.000
yesterday and that's a big Star

01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:09.000
Wars day so along with that

01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:11.000
in For Honor you can use now

01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:13.000
light

01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:15.000
sabers that aren't

01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:17.000
legally, legally not

01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:19.000
light saber but laser

01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:21.000
sword type weapons

01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:23.000
can be used and

01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:25.000
you can go check those out if you have that game.

01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:27.000
So laser

01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:29.000
weapons. Bright swords.

01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:31.000
Very bright swords.

01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:33.000
Sabers of

01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:35.000
lasers.

01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:37.000
That's true. I keep forgetting like yesterday was a

01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:39.000
Star Wars holiday.

01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:41.000
Using my quotey fingers but I guess like an actual

01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:43.000
thing in California was here and they made some honorary

01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:45.000
holiday you know not a real holiday but one of those

01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:47.000
like honorary holidays was like official in

01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:49.000
California now so it's kind of fun. Yeah.

01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:51.000
Which by the way you know happy single

01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:53.000
to my own I guess you know.

01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:55.000
I actually you know what's funny. It's revenge of the 5th.

01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:57.000
I

01:39:57.000 --> 01:39:59.000
I went to brunch with some friends this morning

01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:01.000
and it was you know I had to suggest the place

01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:03.000
because they suggested the place last time. So I was

01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:05.000
like oh let's go and I was just

01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:07.000
last night I was like oh Alan really likes that new taco

01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:09.000
bar place and there's a it opened up

01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:11.000
they just opened up one up in Folsom so let's

01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:13.000
go to the taco bar place. Not even thinking

01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:15.000
today's Cinco de Mayo.

01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:17.000
And I get up this morning and I go oh fuck

01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:19.000
it's Cinco de Mayo and I just suggested we

01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:21.000
go to the taco place. Oh yeah. Luckily

01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:23.000
we got there early enough it wasn't

01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:25.000
horrible but by the time we were

01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:27.000
leaving it was like a shit show

01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:29.000
waiting to get in. They had like the radio station out there

01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:31.000
doing promotions and everything. I should have gotten

01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:33.000
tacos today. It would have been probably cheaper.

01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:35.000
Yeah right.

01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:37.000
I forgot. Gosh.

01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:39.000
Alright moving on. Other rapid fire news.

01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:41.000
Let's talk about Anthem. Let's talk about

01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:43.000
a game that's

01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:45.000
kind of not done so

01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:47.000
well in the fan base.

01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:49.000
Well BioWare is reassuring

01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:51.000
folks that Anthem is not being abandoned

01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:53.000
even though it sure is starting to look that way

01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:55.000
because executive

01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:57.000
producer Mark Dara and lead producer

01:40:57.000 --> 01:40:59.000
Michael Gamble both have started

01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:01.000
working on other BioWare projects.

01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:03.000
And what's interesting Mark Dara

01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:05.000
over on Twitter at BioMarkDara

01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:07.000
said we aren't working on Dragon

01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:09.000
Age 3. We aren't working on Dragon

01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:11.000
Age 5 dot dot dot

01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:13.000
I guess that's that.

01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:15.000
Like just fucking pointing

01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:17.000
a laser sword right at the

01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:19.000
fact that the team has very clearly

01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:21.000
moved on to Dragon Age 4. Many of them.

01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:23.000
Well right cause you know

01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:25.000
Dragon Age 3 already came out.

01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:27.000
Well yeah of course. It was Inquisition.

01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:29.000
3 was Inquisition if you didn't already know.

01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:31.000
Which was awesome.

01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:33.000
Anyway well hopefully Dragon Age 4 is awesome

01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:35.000
because but anyway it was very

01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:37.000
important also because

01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:39.000
even though some of these high profile folks have left

01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:41.000
BioWare is reaffirming

01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:43.000
commitment to Anthem's follow through

01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:45.000
on some of the shortcomings that they had

01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:47.000
earlier. So Michael

01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:49.000
Gamble in a tweet said there's been a lot of

01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:51.000
incorrect speculation on this.

01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:53.000
The studio's support and commitment to

01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:55.000
Anthem has not changed.

01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:57.000
Quoting a tweet from Chad Robertson at BioWare

01:41:57.000 --> 01:41:59.000
who said we remain 100% committed to Anthem

01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:01.000
and look forward to showing players the new content

01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:03.000
we're working on. We want to make sure we aren't

01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:05.000
over promising so our updates on what's

01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:07.000
coming in the game will be focused

01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:09.000
when we have things near completion.

01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:11.000
So my

01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:13.000
understanding is they put out a calendar that they

01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:15.000
haven't really been able to follow very well and just

01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:17.000
Anthem

01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:19.000
I just unfortunately

01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:21.000
like everything that we just kind of feared

01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:23.000
was going to happen with Anthem is happening

01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:25.000
and I think that's all we really need to

01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:27.000
say about that. Best of luck to the team and

01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:29.000
I hope they're able to make a Diablo

01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:31.000
3-esque situation out of this but

01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:33.000
yeah.

01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:35.000
Anyhow let's move on

01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:37.000
and talk about a

01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:39.000
Kickstarter that met its goal

01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:41.000
this week. I think we brought this up on the show

01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:43.000
previously. Antstream is the

01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:45.000
Kickstarter. They met their goal.

01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:47.000
And I should disclose I ended up backing

01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:49.000
it. Somebody actually posted to Discord

01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:51.000
that they met their goal and that was the reminder

01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:53.000
to me I was like oh yeah shit I was

01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:55.000
supposed to go donate my money so I did

01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:57.000
and they've actually hit their first stretch

01:42:57.000 --> 01:42:59.000
goal which is going to be prioritized

01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:01.000
they don't want to over promise when

01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:03.000
Playstation 4 support is coming but they're prioritizing

01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:05.000
Playstation 4 support

01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:07.000
so that will be something that

01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:09.000
happens. If you are not familiar with

01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:11.000
Antstream

01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:13.000
it is a

01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:15.000
kind of trying to legalize what a lot

01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:17.000
of you are doing through ROMs

01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:19.000
and it's going to be allowing you to play

01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:21.000
games on the Amiga, the Commodore 64

01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:23.000
Sega Genesis

01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:25.000
the ZX Spectrum

01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:27.000
because this is actually a company that's based

01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:29.000
over in Britain

01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:31.000
so obviously the ZX was a much

01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:33.000
bigger deal over there and Commodore was a huge deal over there too

01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:35.000
so they're focusing a lot on those systems

01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:37.000
but this will be out in the US as well they are saying

01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:39.000
and US people can back the Kickstarter which I think

01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:41.000
has 4 or 5 more days on it

01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:43.000
they showed some early alpha

01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:45.000
play on a recent

01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:47.000
charity stream overseas

01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:49.000
and that was when I watched that

01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:51.000
that really kind of sold me on it. They were playing Double Dragon

01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:53.000
and they were doing like

01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:55.000
challenges and one of the challenges

01:43:55.000 --> 01:43:57.000
they were doing was as many headbutts

01:43:57.000 --> 01:43:59.000
as they could in one segment of the game in 60 seconds

01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:01.000
and I thought those challenges

01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:03.000
were cool and something

01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:05.000
to add to retro

01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:07.000
that isn't already there

01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:09.000
because again I shouldn't be

01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:11.000
reading the comments section but my stupid

01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:13.000
ass always inevitably does

01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:15.000
and a lot of people taking issue with

01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:17.000
Antstream because

01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:19.000
the games are old

01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:21.000
people are emulating them anyway

01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:23.000
and you're fucking doing it illegally

01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:25.000
like you can sugar coat it all you want

01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:27.000
but technically you're not supposed to be

01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:29.000
doing that. It's just that you know they have an

01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:31.000
enforcer line. Here's the

01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:33.000
more valid criticism of

01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:35.000
Antstream that you know

01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:37.000
Antstream is streaming

01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:39.000
so you're not downloading the ROMs to your computer

01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:41.000
or your Xbox and playing them off

01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:43.000
that. You are streaming it like

01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:45.000
Google Stadia but

01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:47.000
again these games are not at 1080p

01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:49.000
60 frames a second so I think there's a little more

01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:51.000
allowance. I think there's a lot of web pages that are

01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:53.000
probably larger than these games I mean

01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:55.000
I don't think that

01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:57.000
oh no I don't have

01:44:57.000 --> 01:44:59.000
you know the resolution

01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:01.000
of my gigabit

01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:03.000
is going to be a lot lower I'm not so

01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:05.000
worried about if it's going to kill bandwidth

01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:07.000
or not but I do understand some people

01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:09.000
a little more hesitant because of that but I also understand

01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:11.000
that that is one way to make the

01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:13.000
experience consistent between

01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:15.000
Xbox One and mobile phones and all that stuff

01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:17.000
so anyway you know but

01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:19.000
take what I'm saying with a grain of salt I just told you

01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:21.000
I backed it so you know now I guess I have

01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:23.000
an investment in it for whatever it's worth

01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:25.000
but I just I'm excited

01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:27.000
to play the Commodore 64 games

01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:29.000
in an environment that reminds me

01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:31.000
of the old GameTap

01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:33.000
which has a little more competition going with it

01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:35.000
just a little more

01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:37.000
fun in some old classic games

01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:39.000
I wanted to mention real quick since I forgot

01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:41.000
to mention Playstation

01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:43.000
for the month of May we're getting

01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:45.000
Overcooked and

01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:47.000
Edith Finch so those are

01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:49.000
the two games we're getting. Ooh Edith Finch

01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:51.000
such a good game.

01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:53.000
Yeah and Dartitsuya says Anstream

01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:55.000
is getting the rights to host these so I don't think

01:45:55.000 --> 01:45:57.000
there's any legality issues there. Nope

01:45:57.000 --> 01:45:59.000
and you know what they said people would never

01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:01.000
pay for music once Napster

01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:03.000
and LimeWire and all that was a thing and then

01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:05.000
iTunes came out charged

01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:07.000
a reasonable rate made it real easy

01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:09.000
and completely changed the

01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:11.000
industry and of course now we're in a day

01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:13.000
iTunes is still doing its thing

01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:15.000
but now it's probably more on that side Apple

01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:17.000
Music and Spotify and Pandora

01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:19.000
and everything in that streaming space

01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:21.000
ironically here we are talking about streaming

01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:23.000
that legitimizes it so

01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:25.000
anyway enough talk about that let's move on

01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:27.000
to another rapid fire story Dark Sakura

01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:29.000
Well it's finally happening

01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:31.000
and we've kept bringing it up but Bloodstained

01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:33.000
is happening yay

01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:35.000
Finally. Um so

01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:37.000
it looks like we have a

01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:39.000
release date for Xbox One, PS4

01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:41.000
and PC that's gonna be on

01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:43.000
June 18th and the Switch

01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:45.000
version will be out on June 25th

01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:47.000
um but

01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:49.000
the time seems to have been just

01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:51.000
from what I you know I can tell

01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:53.000
that the extra development time should really make it a

01:46:53.000 --> 01:46:55.000
very stellar release. Did you see that

01:46:55.000 --> 01:46:57.000
trailer they put out recently that had like

01:46:57.000 --> 01:46:59.000
Igarashi in it going we heard

01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:01.000
that you thought the graphics were crap

01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:03.000
so we made it better it was very self

01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:05.000
aware again going back to what we kicked

01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:07.000
off the show with this week fan backlash

01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:09.000
causing changes. Well

01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:11.000
it does look really good. But yeah it is

01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:13.000
designed by Igarashi

01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:15.000
Koji who is such

01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:17.000
a rock star that was like the happy thing

01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:19.000
of my last E3 was getting to meet him

01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:21.000
and then

01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:23.000
of course the thing that actually I'm most

01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:25.000
excited about is the music because

01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:27.000
the music is

01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:29.000
done by Yamare Michiru

01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:31.000
who was the lady who did all the music

01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:33.000
for Symphony of the Night and

01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:35.000
Yamare Ippo who was

01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:37.000
Resident Evil

01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:39.000
musician

01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:41.000
so I'm really really looking forward

01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:43.000
to that also it's supposed to be like an even

01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:45.000
bigger castle like the largest

01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:47.000
one in any of Igarashi's games

01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:49.000
so I'm excited

01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:51.000
I might be a little bit

01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:53.000
more excited than I can

01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:55.000
safely keep us PG rated

01:47:55.000 --> 01:47:57.000
In this game my dick is

01:47:57.000 --> 01:47:59.000
bigger than ever with this castle

01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:01.000
right? Yeah

01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:03.000
his castle dick

01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:05.000
and then of course there's been

01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:07.000
this trailer floating around for

01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:09.000
Left 4 Dead 3

01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:11.000
yeah it's fake

01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:13.000
It's fake. If you believe that Valve was doing

01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:15.000
a game with a 3 in it you were setting yourself up

01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:17.000
for failure. Yeah

01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:19.000
I believe someday that that's gonna

01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:21.000
happen

01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:23.000
and it'll be all of the games all the

01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:25.000
3. Today is not that day. No.

01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:27.000
But you can

01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:29.000
pretty much you can

01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:31.000
look at it there's some other

01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:33.000
red flags that

01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:35.000
indicate that it's fake apart from

01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:37.000
Valve just denying it

01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:39.000
you know there's like

01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:41.000
licensed items in

01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:43.000
the game like Quaker Oats

01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:45.000
and they

01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:47.000
use like maps in it from some of the

01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:49.000
other games so yeah if

01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:51.000
you look at it you can tell

01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:53.000
but

01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:55.000
the only thing that we've really seen are

01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:57.000
just some like allegedly

01:48:57.000 --> 01:48:59.000
leaked environmental screenshots

01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:01.000
Didn't we have a story

01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:03.000
just like 2 or 3 weeks ago too that the

01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:05.000
Left 4 Dead team was working on it or like

01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:07.000
a lot of people that were involved with it were

01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:09.000
working on a very similar type of thing

01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:11.000
much akin to this burn out

01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:13.000
Destruction Derby or whatever

01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:15.000
that game is called they just put it out

01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:17.000
and I need to play it. Destructive

01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:19.000
Driving or something like that.

01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:21.000
Dangerous driving. Dangerous driving that's it.

01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:23.000
I'll be honest too. I went back

01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:25.000
to look at some of the screenshots

01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:27.000
and they don't look like they would be anything

01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:29.000
in a

01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:31.000
Left 4 Dead game like it's not

01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:33.000
anything that looks relatively modern

01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:35.000
unless it's like in Italy

01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:37.000
really damaged

01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:39.000
Italy or somewhere in the

01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:41.000
Middle East. Sorry I can't stop laughing

01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:43.000
Maybe Greece. I can't stop laughing now

01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:45.000
at calling that game Distracted Driving because now

01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:47.000
I'm just imagining a trailer that just

01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:49.000
shows like clips from burn out

01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:51.000
when you text on your phone and drive

01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:53.000
and then massive burn out

01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:55.000
you could cause an accident

01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:57.000
and by the way

01:49:57.000 --> 01:49:59.000
if anyone wants to see the

01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:01.000
images referred to

01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:03.000
it's a short URL so it's

01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:05.000
pronounced Imgur

01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:07.000
Imgur?

01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:09.000
Imgur.com

01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:11.000
a like alpha slash b like

01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:13.000
bravo c like Charlie capital w

01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:15.000
like whiskey lowercase f like

01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:17.000
foxtrot 6 j like

01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:19.000
juliet 8

01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:21.000
Hope you write fast. It was Back 4

01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:23.000
Blood was their game. Back 4 Blood thank you

01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:25.000
Well and

01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:27.000
marvel at my NATO alphabet skills yo

01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:29.000
Alright let's

01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:31.000
move on and I'll link this in the chat

01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:33.000
Let's find some things that are coming out

01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:35.000
soon as we look at some

01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:37.000
world release dates and some things that are coming out

01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:39.000
since Left 4 Dead 3 will not be

01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:41.000
Alright

01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:43.000
Well we're only getting a few

01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:45.000
games out this week so Life is Strange

01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:47.000
2 Episode 3 Wasteland

01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:49.000
that's coming on PC PlayStation 4 and Xbox

01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:51.000
1 Yakuza

01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:53.000
Kiwami 2 is out on

01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:55.000
PC and finally

01:50:55.000 --> 01:50:57.000
Saints Row 3rd coming out on

01:50:57.000 --> 01:50:59.000
Nintendo Switch

01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:01.000
That's it

01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:03.000
Alright and if we travel to Japan

01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:05.000
there's no releases in Japan this week

01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:07.000
I believe Golden Week was last week

01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:09.000
maybe wrapping up right now. I don't remember exactly

01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:11.000
Everyone's coming back

01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:13.000
I don't remember exactly how many days it is but regardless

01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:15.000
it would be similar to like

01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:17.000
the day after Christmas. You're not gonna see any

01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:19.000
games come out. If I'm correct in Golden Week

01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:21.000
one of the holidays involved in that

01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:23.000
has

01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:25.000
people going back to their hometowns

01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:27.000
so quite likely people

01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:29.000
would be coming back

01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:31.000
so no point in releasing

01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:33.000
anything. I mean it's a big deal there

01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:35.000
to like what Christmas is here

01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:37.000
when people travel and go

01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:39.000
they're gone for days and so forth

01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:41.000
so just like here

01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:43.000
Business is shut down. Yeah you don't get

01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:45.000
the game releases don't pick up until

01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:47.000
mid-January after Christmas

01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:49.000
maybe you get

01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:51.000
now we're getting to see one or two big ones that will come out

01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:53.000
in a couple weeks after but yeah

01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:55.000
anyway long story short no releases in Japan

01:51:55.000 --> 01:51:57.000
right now but there's good reason for it

01:51:57.000 --> 01:51:59.000
just with the culture over there so

01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:01.000
I will turn it over to Europe, Dark Sakura

01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:03.000
All of these come out

01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:05.000
on May 9th

01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:07.000
and all of them are for Switch

01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:09.000
so Farm Expert 2019

01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:11.000
Mortal Kombat 11

01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:13.000
and Saints Row the Third

01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:15.000
the full package

01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:17.000
An

01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:19.000
autoplay video on this site, sorry

01:52:19.000 --> 01:52:21.000
okay but that's all

01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:23.000
okay let's move on

01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:25.000
and we will go to the mailbag

01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:27.000
you guys send us emails

01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:29.000
participate at orange lounge radio

01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:31.000
dot com and we

01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:33.000
love to read these emails live on air

01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:35.000
and I believe we have one email tonight

01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:37.000
that we do saving you

01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:39.000
from Drag Race discussion

01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:41.000
yay thank you

01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:43.000
girl I got stuff to say about Silky

01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:45.000
I know justice for that

01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:47.000
email that sloppy bitch

01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:49.000
anyway hello L.R.

01:52:49.000 --> 01:52:51.000
I wanted to let Rob

01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:53.000
know that his memory has not failed him

01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:55.000
there was in fact a two

01:52:55.000 --> 01:52:57.000
versus two mode in Ultimate Mortal Kombat

01:52:57.000 --> 01:52:59.000
3 I knew it it was relatively

01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:01.000
basic there was no tagging in or out

01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:03.000
just the second member of a team appearing

01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:05.000
when the first was KO'd and the round

01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:07.000
ending when both members are KO'd

01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:09.000
it would still

01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:11.000
it was still best two out of three

01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:13.000
it wasn't played very often

01:53:13.000 --> 01:53:15.000
though since it cost double the price of an ordinary

01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:17.000
versus match and it didn't typically

01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:19.000
last twice as long I'm sure

01:53:19.000 --> 01:53:21.000
that a lot of folks forgot about it

01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:23.000
that is that everything is saying is correct

01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:25.000
but the arcade operator could set the price

01:53:25.000 --> 01:53:27.000
of that I think the default was

01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:29.000
double but I remember a place that

01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:31.000
was only like one credit to do

01:53:31.000 --> 01:53:33.000
that mode and it's a good way to like

01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:35.000
sample I mean the game had already been out for years

01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:37.000
at that point but it's a good way to sample multiple characters

01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:39.000
when you're like I don't know if I want to play Katana or

01:53:39.000 --> 01:53:41.000
Melina so you can do both

01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:43.000
so that's what was cool about it

01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:45.000
that would be team sibling rivalry

01:53:45.000 --> 01:53:47.000
yes

01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:49.000
team I think I'm a clone now

01:53:49.000 --> 01:53:51.000
personally

01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:53.000
I was far more interested in Ultimate Mortal Combat 3's

01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:55.000
eight player tournament mode

01:53:55.000 --> 01:53:57.000
which set up a single elimination

01:53:57.000 --> 01:53:59.000
tournament consisting of one round matches

01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:01.000
between eight players the thing

01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:03.000
cost eight credits to play but it was

01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:05.000
well worth it because when all the matches

01:54:05.000 --> 01:54:07.000
finished and a winner was crowned that person

01:54:07.000 --> 01:54:09.000
got to select any of the ending rewards

01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:11.000
available in the game including the supreme

01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:13.000
demonstration remember that

01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:15.000
the machine would play every single finishing

01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:17.000
move in the game which would take

01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:19.000
over seven minutes and

01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:21.000
he sent us a link that I'm

01:54:21.000 --> 01:54:23.000
going to post in chat

01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:25.000
her request

01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:27.000
we'll do a midpoint break some week

01:54:27.000 --> 01:54:29.000
where we just play the finishing move

01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:31.000
actually that would be a perfect bathroom

01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:33.000
break because it's seven minutes

01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:35.000
I never

01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:37.000
saw that mode I heard about it but I

01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:39.000
never saw that tournament mode ever

01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:41.000
actually get used

01:54:41.000 --> 01:54:43.000
so I have exactly

01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:45.000
once yeah so actually

01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:47.000
I love that you sent this email to

01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:49.000
kind of remind us I was like oh is that what it

01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:51.000
did or I guess that's one of the options

01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:53.000
but still that's really cool

01:54:53.000 --> 01:54:55.000
at any rate I just posted it

01:54:55.000 --> 01:54:57.000
in the chat and

01:54:57.000 --> 01:54:59.000
if we want to add it in to maybe

01:54:59.000 --> 01:55:01.000
show notes for posting the podcast

01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:03.000
so if I remember I'll do my

01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:05.000
best it's a YouTube so I'm sure if

01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:07.000
you just Google it it's a tube of the you

01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:09.000
yes or are you sure you don't want me to read the URL

01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:11.000
girl it's a lot

01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:13.000
more complicated than what I read

01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:15.000
anyway thanks again for the show

01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:17.000
and have a great week hugs

01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:19.000
Aaron YYR

01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:21.000
well thanks thanks for that

01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:23.000
I'm always down to talk about the old school Mortal Kombats

01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:25.000
well I don't know it's just

01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:27.000
sort of been like I've been in this

01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:29.000
like crazy Mortal Kombat nostalgia

01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:31.000
if you go to

01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:33.000
my fan page

01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:35.000
which is Dark Sakura

01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:37.000
I will link it in chat

01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:39.000
for those here

01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:41.000
wink wink nudge nudge nudge nudge like my status

01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:43.000
well not just that actually

01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:45.000
follow my page

01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:47.000
but I linked

01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:49.000
the old making of Mortal Kombat

01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:51.000
so

01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:53.000
which is pretty cool it's just basically how they did

01:55:53.000 --> 01:55:55.000
a lot of the mocap this is a very

01:55:55.000 --> 01:55:57.000
cool watch I mean it also

01:55:57.000 --> 01:55:59.000
talks into just how primitive

01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:01.000
their mocap techniques were back then and how

01:56:01.000 --> 01:56:03.000
it's evolved to what we have now

01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:05.000
so yeah that was the only other

01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:07.000
email so thank you YYR

01:56:07.000 --> 01:56:09.000
Toshin a blast from the past

01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:11.000
in our chat tonight good to see you

01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:13.000
is in our chat saying a good thing the

01:56:13.000 --> 01:56:15.000
new arcade 1up cabs out now

01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:17.000
make the modes more accessible

01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:19.000
you know I gotta say if I'm a really

01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:21.000
good boy on my spending I think I'm gonna buy myself

01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:23.000
one of those cabinets I just

01:56:23.000 --> 01:56:25.000
I want it

01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:27.000
I don't

01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:29.000
I want it there's just no

01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:31.000
other explanation I want it

01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:33.000
I want the Tempest one

01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:35.000
but

01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:37.000
Black Knight sort of rage

01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:39.000
oh yeah that's right you got that

01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:41.000
Dan's like we'll be fine with the pro fuck no

01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:43.000
it's not Black Knight without having the second

01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:45.000
play field I want a fucking premium

01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:47.000
stomp my foot

01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:49.000
Veruca Salt moment

01:56:49.000 --> 01:56:51.000
Bob Coffee in chat says the arcade 1up cabinets

01:56:51.000 --> 01:56:53.000
are okay yeah I know they're not like the real thing

01:56:53.000 --> 01:56:55.000
and they're smaller and it's a different type of screen

01:56:55.000 --> 01:56:57.000
I want one!

01:56:57.000 --> 01:56:59.000
I think those are bigger though aren't those

01:56:59.000 --> 01:57:01.000
what they have like I think a little

01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:03.000
I thought that they were bigger because I know that

01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:05.000
like the Atari ones and stuff they have like a pedestal

01:57:05.000 --> 01:57:07.000
that you put the cabinet on to make them

01:57:07.000 --> 01:57:09.000
taller but I thought those were

01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:11.000
just already taller because I mean

01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:13.000
children aren't gonna be playing moral combat

01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:15.000
it's a mature rated game right

01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:17.000
yeah sure you wouldn't let

01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:19.000
your kids play it would you?

01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:21.000
they wouldn't be interested

01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:23.000
exactly I probably would let them but

01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:25.000
they wouldn't be interested

01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:27.000
this is too hard

01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:29.000
I just remember though the biggest hype

01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:31.000
about any Mortal Kombat ever in my experience

01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:33.000
was Mortal Kombat 2 and this was

01:57:33.000 --> 01:57:35.000
the year that we were taking the trip up the

01:57:35.000 --> 01:57:37.000
east coast for my high school band

01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:39.000
we actually played at Carnegie Hall

01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:41.000
and that was when all the

01:57:41.000 --> 01:57:43.000
beta machines were still out

01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:45.000
all up the east coast

01:57:45.000 --> 01:57:47.000
so we were like

01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:49.000
which beta is this? and we had

01:57:49.000 --> 01:57:51.000
everyone would have like three different print outs

01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:53.000
based on the beta version that we would

01:57:53.000 --> 01:57:55.000
try to figure out what we were playing

01:57:55.000 --> 01:57:57.000
yeah I remember the first time

01:57:57.000 --> 01:57:59.000
I saw Mortal Kombat 2 my mind was blown

01:57:59.000 --> 01:58:01.000
I saw it at like a bowling alley

01:58:01.000 --> 01:58:03.000
and like you know I'm sure we all saw the first game

01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:05.000
and played it but like the second one was like

01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:07.000
somehow the graphics were even

01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:09.000
better even though it was still that whole like

01:58:09.000 --> 01:58:11.000
digitized people thing and it was just like my mind was

01:58:11.000 --> 01:58:13.000
blown like so good

01:58:13.000 --> 01:58:15.000
so and then I remember

01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:17.000
seeing the third game for the first time and I was also

01:58:17.000 --> 01:58:19.000
like wow this looks like really different

01:58:19.000 --> 01:58:21.000
but I don't know even as much as I enjoy

01:58:21.000 --> 01:58:23.000
the third game like it just it wasn't the

01:58:23.000 --> 01:58:25.000
same as 2 I don't know what it is

01:58:25.000 --> 01:58:27.000
2 just had like the magic

01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:29.000
that 1 built

01:58:29.000 --> 01:58:31.000
yeah cause 1 is

01:58:31.000 --> 01:58:33.000
kind of hard to go back and play it because it was a

01:58:33.000 --> 01:58:35.000
very slow game I think 3's

01:58:35.000 --> 01:58:37.000
biggest problem was taking Sub-Zero's mask

01:58:37.000 --> 01:58:39.000
off it just didn't feel the same

01:58:39.000 --> 01:58:41.000
yeah but 2

01:58:41.000 --> 01:58:43.000
had all the charm

01:58:43.000 --> 01:58:45.000
and violence of 1

01:58:45.000 --> 01:58:47.000
but it was at a more playable speed

01:58:47.000 --> 01:58:49.000
it was a faster game

01:58:49.000 --> 01:58:51.000
alright anyhow

01:58:51.000 --> 01:58:53.000
ok well our mailbag segment

01:58:53.000 --> 01:58:55.000
turned into Mortal Kombat talk but hey that's ok

01:58:55.000 --> 01:58:57.000
let's move on to some more

01:58:57.000 --> 01:58:59.000
news alright now

01:58:59.000 --> 01:59:01.000
Loki now what does it say up there

01:59:01.000 --> 01:59:03.000
now what can we talk about

01:59:03.000 --> 01:59:05.000
at this point in the show

01:59:07.000 --> 01:59:09.000
fine I'm sure you have

01:59:09.000 --> 01:59:11.000
some choice things to say to me right

01:59:11.000 --> 01:59:13.000
so

01:59:13.000 --> 01:59:15.000
Microsoft you know well aware

01:59:15.000 --> 01:59:17.000
that their Xbox Live service is

01:59:17.000 --> 01:59:19.000
full of the

01:59:19.000 --> 01:59:21.000
best people so they

01:59:21.000 --> 01:59:23.000
decided that they're gonna put out

01:59:23.000 --> 01:59:25.000
acceptable trash talk examples

01:59:25.000 --> 01:59:27.000
what I hadn't heard

01:59:27.000 --> 01:59:29.000
and what not to do

01:59:29.000 --> 01:59:31.000
when you're trash talking

01:59:31.000 --> 01:59:33.000
so for example

01:59:33.000 --> 01:59:35.000
some things that you shouldn't say

01:59:35.000 --> 01:59:37.000
hey profanity

01:59:37.000 --> 01:59:39.000
that was some serious potato aim

01:59:39.000 --> 01:59:41.000
get wrecked trash

01:59:41.000 --> 01:59:43.000
who the fuck talks like that?

01:59:43.000 --> 01:59:45.000
nobody talks like that

01:59:45.000 --> 01:59:47.000
that was a very potato reading

01:59:47.000 --> 01:59:49.000
get wrecked trash

01:59:49.000 --> 01:59:51.000
the only reason you went positive

01:59:51.000 --> 01:59:53.000
was you spent all game camping

01:59:53.000 --> 01:59:55.000
kys kid

01:59:55.000 --> 01:59:57.000
ok well you shouldn't tell children to kill

cheap win

02:00:07.000 --> 02:00:09.000
totally expected from a racial

02:00:09.000 --> 02:00:11.000
slur

02:00:11.000 --> 02:00:13.000
racial slurs are not ok I'm not gonna make fun of that

02:00:13.000 --> 02:00:15.000
one they do need to get rid of those

02:00:15.000 --> 02:00:17.000
but anyways yeah so they have this whole

02:00:17.000 --> 02:00:19.000
website and they actually

02:00:19.000 --> 02:00:21.000
broke it down by like different

02:00:21.000 --> 02:00:23.000
categories of like how what you should

02:00:23.000 --> 02:00:25.000
and should not do like attitude

02:00:25.000 --> 02:00:27.000
and standards

02:00:27.000 --> 02:00:29.000
keep it legal

02:00:29.000 --> 02:00:31.000
attitude check

02:00:31.000 --> 02:00:33.000
anyone? says Xbox Lives

02:00:33.000 --> 02:00:35.000
Ville in all countries for example

02:00:35.000 --> 02:00:37.000
you know build a club around illegal

02:00:37.000 --> 02:00:39.000
drug use don't do that

02:00:39.000 --> 02:00:41.000
create messages that encourage

02:00:41.000 --> 02:00:43.000
underage drinking don't do that

02:00:43.000 --> 02:00:45.000
tell other players to kill

02:00:45.000 --> 02:00:47.000
themselves or commit self harm

02:00:47.000 --> 02:00:49.000
don't do that upload

02:00:49.000 --> 02:00:51.000
custom gamer pics that show animal

02:00:51.000 --> 02:00:53.000
abuse why would you

02:00:53.000 --> 02:00:55.000
do that

02:00:55.000 --> 02:00:57.000
for example don't

02:00:57.000 --> 02:00:59.000
spam into substance

02:00:59.000 --> 02:01:01.000
turning spam into substance regularly offering

02:01:01.000 --> 02:01:03.000
prizes in exchange for follows

02:01:03.000 --> 02:01:05.000

02:01:05.000 --> 02:01:07.000
what stuff we should

02:01:07.000 --> 02:01:09.000
be doing so

02:01:09.000 --> 02:01:11.000

says KYS I just want you to think

02:01:41.000 --> 02:01:43.000

should say get destroyed can't believe

02:02:01.000 --> 02:02:03.000
you thought you were on my level

02:02:03.000 --> 02:02:05.000
that was some serious potato aim

02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:07.000
get rekt

02:02:07.000 --> 02:02:09.000
so I can say that was potato aim

02:02:09.000 --> 02:02:11.000
get rekt

02:02:11.000 --> 02:02:13.000
cheap win come at me

02:02:13.000 --> 02:02:15.000
when you can actually drive without running cars off

02:02:15.000 --> 02:02:17.000
the road hey I take that personally

02:02:17.000 --> 02:02:19.000
I can't keep the car on the road

02:02:19.000 --> 02:02:21.000
and you know what

02:02:21.000 --> 02:02:23.000
if they didn't want me to drive off road they wouldn't let me drive

02:02:23.000 --> 02:02:25.000
off road

02:02:27.000 --> 02:02:29.000
make stuff suitable for

02:02:29.000 --> 02:02:31.000
all audiences for example

02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:33.000
don't upload a custom

02:02:33.000 --> 02:02:35.000
gamer pic that contains nudity

02:02:35.000 --> 02:02:37.000
share send

02:02:37.000 --> 02:02:39.000
loot messages to other players

02:02:39.000 --> 02:02:41.000
hey

02:02:41.000 --> 02:02:43.000
you want to slide into my DMs

02:02:43.000 --> 02:02:45.000
TYS

02:02:45.000 --> 02:02:47.000
harmful

02:02:47.000 --> 02:02:49.000
behavior that has no place on

02:02:49.000 --> 02:02:51.000
Xbox for example use

02:02:51.000 --> 02:02:53.000
mods that explicitly support it

02:02:53.000 --> 02:02:55.000
or that are not explicitly supported

02:02:55.000 --> 02:02:57.000
by game developers you wouldn't

02:02:57.000 --> 02:02:59.000
mod your game would you

02:02:59.000 --> 02:03:01.000
exploit to duplicate

02:03:01.000 --> 02:03:03.000
in-game items don't do

02:03:03.000 --> 02:03:05.000
that bad people

02:03:09.000 --> 02:03:11.000
connect modified or tampered

02:03:11.000 --> 02:03:13.000
hardware to the Xbox Live

02:03:15.000 --> 02:03:17.000
god this sounds lame

02:03:17.000 --> 02:03:19.000
how about I do none of those things

02:03:19.000 --> 02:03:21.000
we know that Xbox Live is this forever

02:03:21.000 --> 02:03:23.000
punchline about that it's just trash

02:03:23.000 --> 02:03:25.000
when you go on there and you

02:03:25.000 --> 02:03:27.000
use voice chat so I understand

02:03:27.000 --> 02:03:29.000
that Microsoft is under some pressure

02:03:29.000 --> 02:03:31.000
to do literally anything about it

02:03:31.000 --> 02:03:33.000
so this is that like it's

02:03:33.000 --> 02:03:35.000
it's something it may not be much

02:03:35.000 --> 02:03:37.000
but I know I've learned the term potato

02:03:37.000 --> 02:03:39.000
aim I'm gonna use that

02:03:39.000 --> 02:03:41.000
in a sentence at some point

02:03:41.000 --> 02:03:43.000
that's how that's how I play overwatch

02:03:43.000 --> 02:03:45.000
with my potato aim

02:03:45.000 --> 02:03:47.000
straight Idaho

02:03:47.000 --> 02:03:49.000
potato aim

02:03:51.000 --> 02:03:53.000
anyway

02:03:53.000 --> 02:03:55.000
Mr. Smoosh is yelling in the

02:03:55.000 --> 02:03:57.000
other room that I have potato aim right now

02:03:57.000 --> 02:03:59.000
be right back

02:03:59.000 --> 02:04:01.000
I have to go cuddle him against his will

02:04:01.000 --> 02:04:03.000
Bobby Blackwolf in chat says my potato aim

02:04:03.000 --> 02:04:05.000
is so bad it's not even from Idaho

02:04:11.000 --> 02:04:13.000
so like I'm trying to understand what they

02:04:13.000 --> 02:04:15.000
I'm trying to fill in their blanks

02:04:15.000 --> 02:04:17.000
here so get sexual threat

02:04:17.000 --> 02:04:19.000
can't believe you thought you were on my

02:04:19.000 --> 02:04:21.000
level like get fucked is that

02:04:21.000 --> 02:04:23.000
like a sexual threat either get

02:04:23.000 --> 02:04:25.000
fucked or get what

02:04:25.000 --> 02:04:27.000
you would call if you force sex upon

02:04:27.000 --> 02:04:29.000
someone against their will

02:04:29.000 --> 02:04:31.000
I've I've heard of that one being

02:04:31.000 --> 02:04:33.000
uh flinged around on Xbox Live

02:04:33.000 --> 02:04:35.000
and it's not okay just to be

02:04:35.000 --> 02:04:37.000
explicitly clear so

02:04:37.000 --> 02:04:39.000
anyway again

02:04:39.000 --> 02:04:41.000
Microsoft has to do something but

02:04:41.000 --> 02:04:43.000
yeah at the end of the day if they're

02:04:43.000 --> 02:04:45.000
not gonna ban people for being fuckheads

02:04:45.000 --> 02:04:47.000
which I guess maybe I'm not supposed to

02:04:47.000 --> 02:04:49.000
say but when you do say these types of things

02:04:49.000 --> 02:04:51.000
you are in fact being a fuckhead so

02:04:51.000 --> 02:04:53.000
what about just say get consensually

02:04:53.000 --> 02:04:55.000
fucked like well

02:04:55.000 --> 02:04:57.000
I don't know I don't because that that's

02:04:57.000 --> 02:04:59.000
no I

02:04:59.000 --> 02:05:01.000
anyway moving on

02:05:01.000 --> 02:05:03.000
let's talk let's talk

02:05:03.000 --> 02:05:05.000
about a company that is banning some fools

02:05:05.000 --> 02:05:07.000
uh respawn behind

02:05:07.000 --> 02:05:09.000
apex legends of course y'all playing some

02:05:09.000 --> 02:05:11.000
apex legends well uh

02:05:11.000 --> 02:05:13.000
770,000 of you just got

02:05:13.000 --> 02:05:15.000
banned congratulations

02:05:15.000 --> 02:05:17.000
although I would guess this is

02:05:17.000 --> 02:05:19.000
probably not 770,000 individual

02:05:19.000 --> 02:05:21.000
people this is probably

02:05:21.000 --> 02:05:23.000
770 trolls with 1000

02:05:23.000 --> 02:05:25.000
accounts or something along those lines

02:05:25.000 --> 02:05:27.000
anyhow uh

02:05:27.000 --> 02:05:29.000
respawn did I was

02:05:29.000 --> 02:05:31.000
kind of looking at this going didn't we kind of

02:05:31.000 --> 02:05:33.000
already have this and yeah

02:05:33.000 --> 02:05:35.000
this is a follow up because respawn did

02:05:35.000 --> 02:05:37.000
they said we've still got plans to deal with

02:05:37.000 --> 02:05:39.000
cheaters we're not gonna tell you what those plans are

02:05:39.000 --> 02:05:41.000
because we don't want you circumventing it so it has

02:05:41.000 --> 02:05:43.000
to be a little bit vague but there was

02:05:43.000 --> 02:05:45.000
another blog post that said

02:05:45.000 --> 02:05:47.000
uh the recent added in-game

02:05:47.000 --> 02:05:49.000
reporting tools had a big impact on

02:05:49.000 --> 02:05:51.000
discovering new cheats including

02:05:51.000 --> 02:05:53.000
previously undetectable cheats that are now being

02:05:53.000 --> 02:05:55.000
found automatically via EAC

02:05:55.000 --> 02:05:57.000
what's EAC is that EAC's cheat

02:05:57.000 --> 02:05:59.000
controller is that an acronym for something else

02:05:59.000 --> 02:06:01.000
EAC it's gotta be some probably some

02:06:01.000 --> 02:06:03.000
yeah uh anyway total

02:06:03.000 --> 02:06:05.000
bands are now at 770,000

02:06:05.000 --> 02:06:07.000
players we've blocked

02:06:07.000 --> 02:06:09.000
300,000 account creations

02:06:09.000 --> 02:06:11.000
we've banned 4,000 cheat

02:06:11.000 --> 02:06:13.000
seller accounts spammers in the

02:06:13.000 --> 02:06:15.000
last 20 days total

02:06:15.000 --> 02:06:17.000
matches on PC impacted by cheaters

02:06:17.000 --> 02:06:19.000
or spammers has been reduced by over half

02:06:19.000 --> 02:06:21.000
in the last month due to recent efforts

02:06:21.000 --> 02:06:23.000
in a quote here

02:06:23.000 --> 02:06:25.000
from Drew McCoy the executive producer

02:06:25.000 --> 02:06:27.000
it is a constant war with the cheat

02:06:27.000 --> 02:06:29.000
makers that we will continue to fight we take

02:06:29.000 --> 02:06:31.000
cheating in Apex Legends incredibly seriously

02:06:31.000 --> 02:06:33.000
and have a large amount of resources tackling

02:06:33.000 --> 02:06:35.000
it from a variety of angles

02:06:35.000 --> 02:06:37.000
uh saying he will be back next week

02:06:37.000 --> 02:06:39.000

02:06:39.000 --> 02:06:41.000
called out in last week's post so

02:06:41.000 --> 02:06:43.000
you better look out cause uh

02:06:43.000 --> 02:06:45.000
Drew McCoy and the rest of the uh

02:06:45.000 --> 02:06:47.000
Apex team is coming for you and

02:06:47.000 --> 02:06:49.000
stop cheating in multiplayer games

02:06:49.000 --> 02:06:51.000
like if you want to cheat in a single player game

02:06:51.000 --> 02:06:53.000
or if you want to form your own little

02:06:53.000 --> 02:06:55.000
instance with your friends where you're all

02:06:55.000 --> 02:06:57.000
consensually cheating and all that stuff fine

02:06:57.000 --> 02:06:59.000
go off have fun but

02:06:59.000 --> 02:07:01.000
like don't inflict that stuff on strangers who

02:07:01.000 --> 02:07:03.000
just want to play the game and have a good time alright

02:07:03.000 --> 02:07:05.000
calm down so anyway

02:07:05.000 --> 02:07:07.000
um yeah

02:07:07.000 --> 02:07:09.000
it's true SD100 Matt says trolls find a way

02:07:09.000 --> 02:07:11.000
active says trolls gonna troll

02:07:11.000 --> 02:07:13.000
uh DJ Rama S says EAC is something called

02:07:13.000 --> 02:07:15.000
easy anti cheat so I'm just I'm not

02:07:15.000 --> 02:07:17.000
familiar with the uh term there so

02:07:17.000 --> 02:07:19.000
alright well uh

02:07:19.000 --> 02:07:21.000
yeah don't don't be a jerk

02:07:21.000 --> 02:07:23.000
in Apex Legends that's the

02:07:23.000 --> 02:07:25.000
that's the thing to take away from this

02:07:25.000 --> 02:07:27.000
but it is an extremely

02:07:27.000 --> 02:07:29.000
popular online game right now like

02:07:29.000 --> 02:07:31.000
I don't is it still outperforming Fortnite

02:07:31.000 --> 02:07:33.000
or how is that all calm down on Twitch

02:07:33.000 --> 02:07:35.000
I don't know haven't looked at the rankings lately

02:07:35.000 --> 02:07:37.000
probably pretty close it's it's still up there

02:07:37.000 --> 02:07:39.000
until the next thing comes out you can't ignore

02:07:39.000 --> 02:07:41.000
how uh what a big game it is right now

02:07:41.000 --> 02:07:43.000
speaking of big games

02:07:43.000 --> 02:07:45.000
whether Bobby Blackwolf wants to

02:07:45.000 --> 02:07:47.000
believe it or not there's still a big one out there on mobile

02:07:47.000 --> 02:07:49.000
right DarkSakura?

02:07:49.000 --> 02:07:51.000
there's the Pokemans

02:07:51.000 --> 02:07:53.000
uh there is

02:07:53.000 --> 02:07:55.000
a uh

02:07:55.000 --> 02:07:57.000
release of actually a

02:07:57.000 --> 02:07:59.000
confirmation of information the Pokemon Go

02:07:59.000 --> 02:08:01.000
community basically investigated into

02:08:01.000 --> 02:08:03.000
the new late guardians but Niantic actually

02:08:03.000 --> 02:08:05.000
did announce that Uxie

02:08:05.000 --> 02:08:07.000
Mesprite

02:08:07.000 --> 02:08:09.000
and Azelf

02:08:09.000 --> 02:08:11.000
whatever names um

02:08:11.000 --> 02:08:13.000
are all going to be available via

02:08:13.000 --> 02:08:15.000
region specific raids through May

02:08:15.000 --> 02:08:17.000
27th

02:08:17.000 --> 02:08:19.000
they were random spawns

02:08:19.000 --> 02:08:21.000
they were hard to find but now you can

02:08:21.000 --> 02:08:23.000
get them from your

02:08:23.000 --> 02:08:25.000
raids Asia Pacific

02:08:25.000 --> 02:08:27.000
is gonna get Uxie

02:08:27.000 --> 02:08:29.000
Eastern

02:08:29.000 --> 02:08:31.000
sorry European Union Middle East

02:08:31.000 --> 02:08:33.000
Africa India gets Mesprite

02:08:33.000 --> 02:08:35.000
and America and Greenland

02:08:35.000 --> 02:08:37.000
get Azelf

02:08:37.000 --> 02:08:39.000
so there you go

02:08:39.000 --> 02:08:41.000
there the late guardians from gen 4

02:08:41.000 --> 02:08:43.000
now I know they haven't confirmed

02:08:43.000 --> 02:08:45.000
this yet but my assumption is

02:08:45.000 --> 02:08:47.000
that these guys are gonna rotate

02:08:47.000 --> 02:08:49.000
cause didn't the dogs from gen 2

02:08:49.000 --> 02:08:51.000
they did the same thing like

02:08:51.000 --> 02:08:53.000
one region got you know one dog

02:08:53.000 --> 02:08:55.000
another got you know another

02:08:55.000 --> 02:08:57.000
and then they rotated so like this should be like

02:08:57.000 --> 02:08:59.000
the next three months worth of raids right

02:08:59.000 --> 02:09:01.000
yeah that's my assumption anyway

02:09:01.000 --> 02:09:03.000
so interesting

02:09:03.000 --> 02:09:05.000
uh I have yet to catch one you know

02:09:05.000 --> 02:09:07.000
I as much as you know we tease

02:09:07.000 --> 02:09:09.000
Bobby Blockwolf and I know he's teasing us right back

02:09:09.000 --> 02:09:11.000
when he says hashtag dead game

02:09:11.000 --> 02:09:13.000
and we're like no it's not um I

02:09:13.000 --> 02:09:15.000
I do notice that like

02:09:15.000 --> 02:09:17.000
the raid scene is kinda

02:09:17.000 --> 02:09:19.000
it's at least around me it's kinda slowing

02:09:19.000 --> 02:09:21.000
down cause I think people are just getting a little burned out

02:09:21.000 --> 02:09:23.000
kinda feels like it's just like the same thing

02:09:23.000 --> 02:09:25.000
and the Pokemon aren't that exciting

02:09:25.000 --> 02:09:27.000
and there's so many events

02:09:27.000 --> 02:09:29.000
I'm not sure what the game could do

02:09:29.000 --> 02:09:31.000
to really wake people up I don't know if the

02:09:31.000 --> 02:09:33.000
secret is just release gen 5

02:09:33.000 --> 02:09:35.000
I don't know

02:09:35.000 --> 02:09:37.000
do you think there's something Pokemon Go

02:09:37.000 --> 02:09:39.000
could do to get people kinda like back

02:09:39.000 --> 02:09:41.000
interested in it again

02:09:41.000 --> 02:09:43.000
make it competitive

02:09:43.000 --> 02:09:45.000
yeah I mean they have PVP

02:09:45.000 --> 02:09:47.000
well they have PVP but it's kinda

02:09:47.000 --> 02:09:49.000
it's very much a side show you know what I mean

02:09:49.000 --> 02:09:51.000
I don't know I think it's fun right now

02:09:51.000 --> 02:09:53.000
uh oh Totion

02:09:53.000 --> 02:09:55.000
in chat says Niantic said no rotation

02:09:55.000 --> 02:09:57.000
right now what

02:09:57.000 --> 02:09:59.000
I think they really want people to trade

02:09:59.000 --> 02:10:01.000
for that stuff you're gonna have to really be able to

02:10:01.000 --> 02:10:03.000
trade long distance stuff I think they're gonna

02:10:03.000 --> 02:10:05.000
end up doing the rotation or they'll

02:10:05.000 --> 02:10:07.000
they'll make it like quest

02:10:07.000 --> 02:10:09.000
rewards or something like that I don't know

02:10:09.000 --> 02:10:11.000
that's probably what's gonna end up happening

02:10:11.000 --> 02:10:13.000
we'll see or maybe you'll have to

02:10:13.000 --> 02:10:15.000
get real lucky and catch them in the wild

02:10:15.000 --> 02:10:17.000
which apparently has been a thing going on

02:10:17.000 --> 02:10:19.000
alright well Loki along

02:10:19.000 --> 02:10:21.000
the Pokemon lines yeah so they're doing

02:10:21.000 --> 02:10:23.000
this brand new app that's coming out now

02:10:23.000 --> 02:10:25.000
called Pokemon Pass

02:10:25.000 --> 02:10:27.000
which is gonna be separate from Pokemon Go

02:10:27.000 --> 02:10:29.000
but you can actually get Pokemon

02:10:29.000 --> 02:10:31.000
much like you did in the 3DS or

02:10:31.000 --> 02:10:33.000
the DS at different locations

02:10:33.000 --> 02:10:35.000
they'll unlock different things

02:10:35.000 --> 02:10:37.000
like for example the first

02:10:37.000 --> 02:10:39.000
thing that's gonna be

02:10:39.000 --> 02:10:41.000
available is on

02:10:41.000 --> 02:10:43.000
May 11th and if you have

02:10:43.000 --> 02:10:45.000
Pokemon Let's Go with the app it'll allow you

02:10:45.000 --> 02:10:47.000
to unlock a shiny Pikachu or

02:10:47.000 --> 02:10:49.000
shiny Eevee for Let's Go

02:10:49.000 --> 02:10:51.000
so that's if you go to Target

02:10:51.000 --> 02:10:53.000
and

02:10:53.000 --> 02:10:55.000
use your app there

02:10:55.000 --> 02:10:57.000
ok wait so you're gonna have to

02:10:57.000 --> 02:10:59.000
scan a QR code? I think

02:10:59.000 --> 02:11:01.000
so that's it?

02:11:01.000 --> 02:11:03.000
like you use this

02:11:03.000 --> 02:11:05.000
app to scan a QR code

02:11:05.000 --> 02:11:07.000
and so I have to go to Target

02:11:07.000 --> 02:11:09.000
to get that QR code gosh

02:11:09.000 --> 02:11:11.000
there's no possible way

02:11:11.000 --> 02:11:13.000
a QR code

02:11:13.000 --> 02:11:15.000
that correct me if I'm wrong never

02:11:15.000 --> 02:11:17.000
changes right Loki it's just gonna be the same

02:11:17.000 --> 02:11:19.000
QR code on like a cardboard I don't know that

02:11:19.000 --> 02:11:21.000
yeah there's no way

02:11:21.000 --> 02:11:23.000
that like I don't know if somebody

02:11:23.000 --> 02:11:25.000
could take like a picture of that and

02:11:25.000 --> 02:11:27.000
put it on

02:11:27.000 --> 02:11:29.000
the internet and I could just

02:11:29.000 --> 02:11:31.000
scan my monitor

02:11:31.000 --> 02:11:33.000
if it's like a poster up

02:11:33.000 --> 02:11:35.000
on the wall yes

02:11:35.000 --> 02:11:37.000
if it's like an app or something like

02:11:37.000 --> 02:11:39.000
in the store like a kiosk or something that

02:11:39.000 --> 02:11:41.000
generates a unique QR code

02:11:41.000 --> 02:11:43.000
for you then perhaps

02:11:43.000 --> 02:11:45.000
ok that's gonna be a little harder yeah

02:11:45.000 --> 02:11:47.000
let's think about the minimal

02:11:47.000 --> 02:11:49.000
viable product here it's gonna be a fucking

02:11:49.000 --> 02:11:51.000
poster and that'll

02:11:51.000 --> 02:11:53.000
be up on the internet immediately and

02:11:53.000 --> 02:11:55.000
yeah

02:11:55.000 --> 02:11:57.000
cause that's what happened with the um

02:11:57.000 --> 02:11:59.000
god what was that game

02:11:59.000 --> 02:12:01.000
that was trying to compete against Pokemon

02:12:01.000 --> 02:12:03.000
yokai watch ok so yokai watch had

02:12:03.000 --> 02:12:05.000
QR codes in it right and there was kind of like

02:12:05.000 --> 02:12:07.000
a similar thing with the anime I think had

02:12:07.000 --> 02:12:09.000
QR codes in it you could like scan it in the anime

02:12:09.000 --> 02:12:11.000
yeah that shit was on the internet in days

02:12:11.000 --> 02:12:13.000
you know hours minutes

02:12:13.000 --> 02:12:15.000
you know it's just not

02:12:15.000 --> 02:12:17.000
yeah I'm sure that's what's gonna happen with Pokemon

02:12:17.000 --> 02:12:19.000
pass as well but hey I

02:12:19.000 --> 02:12:21.000
hey I'm all for extra

02:12:21.000 --> 02:12:23.000
things and extra perks in these

02:12:23.000 --> 02:12:25.000
games fun right

02:12:25.000 --> 02:12:27.000
why not yeah we'll see maybe

02:12:27.000 --> 02:12:29.000
if if they then and act F

02:12:29.000 --> 02:12:31.000
and chat is telling me about the last story with the

02:12:31.000 --> 02:12:33.000
Pokemon rights they'll keep them regional since they'll

02:12:33.000 --> 02:12:35.000
still be appearing in the wild maybe I'll have to use

02:12:35.000 --> 02:12:37.000
a QR code to get them maybe that'll be

02:12:37.000 --> 02:12:39.000
the thing who knows

02:12:39.000 --> 02:12:41.000
we'll see what Pokemon pass lends

02:12:41.000 --> 02:12:43.000
itself to later

02:12:43.000 --> 02:12:45.000
act F says the QR is already on the

02:12:45.000 --> 02:12:47.000
internet well that didn't take long uh

02:12:47.000 --> 02:12:49.000
and maybe you know what maybe this is how they

02:12:49.000 --> 02:12:51.000
plan to do

02:12:51.000 --> 02:12:53.000
the legendary distributions

02:12:53.000 --> 02:12:55.000
uh for the gen 8

02:12:55.000 --> 02:12:57.000
games for um

02:12:57.000 --> 02:12:59.000
I already forget the name sword and shield

02:12:59.000 --> 02:13:01.000
and gun

02:13:01.000 --> 02:13:03.000
this is how they plan to distribute

02:13:03.000 --> 02:13:05.000
for sword and shield is that

02:13:05.000 --> 02:13:07.000
they're gonna use this app and do it instead of those

02:13:07.000 --> 02:13:09.000
game stop cards with the codes

02:13:09.000 --> 02:13:11.000
who knows anyway

02:13:11.000 --> 02:13:13.000
alright uh one more

02:13:13.000 --> 02:13:15.000
story I think for you guys before we get to the listener

02:13:15.000 --> 02:13:17.000
round tables if you want to call into the show you can join our

02:13:17.000 --> 02:13:19.000
discord vog network.com slash discord

02:13:19.000 --> 02:13:21.000
and we'll be uh looking for some calls in the

02:13:21.000 --> 02:13:23.000
green room if you want to give us a shout to what you want to talk about

02:13:23.000 --> 02:13:25.000
tonight just uh mention it in channel

02:13:25.000 --> 02:13:27.000
orange lounge radio so again

02:13:27.000 --> 02:13:29.000
vog network vognetwork.com

02:13:29.000 --> 02:13:31.000
slash discord but uh

02:13:31.000 --> 02:13:33.000
our last official story tonight has to do with

02:13:33.000 --> 02:13:35.000
a game that's pretty old at this point but it was on a ton

02:13:35.000 --> 02:13:37.000
of uh it was like on PC it was on the original

02:13:37.000 --> 02:13:39.000
Wii it was on it was all over it's a game called

02:13:39.000 --> 02:13:41.000
World of Goo well

02:13:41.000 --> 02:13:43.000
World of Goo got a PC

02:13:43.000 --> 02:13:45.000
update this week and that game hasn't been

02:13:45.000 --> 02:13:47.000
updated in probably 10 years

02:13:47.000 --> 02:13:49.000
what's interesting about this update

02:13:49.000 --> 02:13:51.000
this isn't some little like bug fix

02:13:51.000 --> 02:13:53.000
all these years later update or things like that

02:13:53.000 --> 02:13:55.000
actually what's really cool about this

02:13:55.000 --> 02:13:57.000
it changes the

02:13:57.000 --> 02:13:59.000
resolutions to now do a

02:13:59.000 --> 02:14:01.000
16 by 9 display because when the game

02:14:01.000 --> 02:14:03.000
came out 4 by 3 was a little bit

02:14:03.000 --> 02:14:05.000
more of the standard and it

02:14:05.000 --> 02:14:07.000
has an HD makeover because the original

02:14:07.000 --> 02:14:09.000
resolution of the game only ran at

02:14:09.000 --> 02:14:11.000
800 by 600 so

02:14:11.000 --> 02:14:13.000
no no HD version

02:14:13.000 --> 02:14:15.000
no no remaster just

02:14:15.000 --> 02:14:17.000
an update to World of Goo to make

02:14:17.000 --> 02:14:19.000
it better I should point out though

02:14:19.000 --> 02:14:21.000
no new levels no new challenges

02:14:21.000 --> 02:14:23.000
they didn't really change anything in the game but still very

02:14:23.000 --> 02:14:25.000
cool that they are updating it to support

02:14:25.000 --> 02:14:27.000
more modern PCs

02:14:27.000 --> 02:14:29.000
so hooray for that

02:14:29.000 --> 02:14:31.000
a polite applause for a

02:14:31.000 --> 02:14:33.000
game maker willing to go back and update their very old

02:14:33.000 --> 02:14:35.000
game but again I think a lot of people probably

02:14:35.000 --> 02:14:37.000
own this because they just it was so many sales

02:14:37.000 --> 02:14:39.000
and so many things of that

02:14:39.000 --> 02:14:41.000
nature and so forth I'm just uh

02:14:41.000 --> 02:14:43.000
very very uh happy to

02:14:43.000 --> 02:14:45.000
see that so alright

02:14:45.000 --> 02:14:47.000
so anyway um

02:14:47.000 --> 02:14:49.000
oh gosh okay I don't

02:14:49.000 --> 02:14:51.000
I don't usually read these on air

02:14:51.000 --> 02:14:53.000
I don't usually read all these at once because it

02:14:53.000 --> 02:14:55.000
kind of derails the show a little bit but this is a big one

02:14:55.000 --> 02:14:57.000
and plus we're getting into the listener round table anyway

02:14:57.000 --> 02:14:59.000
so it's appropriate to read it this time

02:14:59.000 --> 02:15:01.000
um but I do want to acknowledge this we

02:15:01.000 --> 02:15:05.000
just got 3,500 biddies

02:15:05.000 --> 02:15:07.000
from that's a lot of biddies

02:15:07.000 --> 02:15:09.000
we just got 3,500 biddies

02:15:09.000 --> 02:15:11.000
from uh schmagtastic in our

02:15:11.000 --> 02:15:13.000
chat saying um and I hope

02:15:13.000 --> 02:15:15.000
I said your name right I'm sorry if I butchered

02:15:15.000 --> 02:15:17.000
it especially after what a sweet gesture that is

02:15:17.000 --> 02:15:19.000
saying this podcast was

02:15:19.000 --> 02:15:21.000
literally my adolescence and has transcended

02:15:21.000 --> 02:15:23.000
into my adulthood again

02:15:23.000 --> 02:15:25.000
just extending my gratitude to you all

02:15:25.000 --> 02:15:27.000
for such a great community and podcast

02:15:27.000 --> 02:15:29.000
so allow me to express

02:15:29.000 --> 02:15:31.000
my gratitude for you uh

02:15:31.000 --> 02:15:33.000
for for doing that and uh thank you

02:15:33.000 --> 02:15:35.000
um it's and it's not just about the biddies

02:15:35.000 --> 02:15:37.000
I mean don't get me wrong appreciate it but

02:15:37.000 --> 02:15:39.000
uh just even

02:15:39.000 --> 02:15:41.000
just saying that just the fact that

02:15:41.000 --> 02:15:43.000
we've had that impact on somebody

02:15:43.000 --> 02:15:45.000
in some sort of little way just means

02:15:45.000 --> 02:15:47.000
a lot that's it

02:15:47.000 --> 02:15:49.000
always kind of blows me away like for one

02:15:49.000 --> 02:15:51.000
that we've been doing this show as long as we

02:15:51.000 --> 02:15:53.000
have

02:15:53.000 --> 02:15:55.000
and the other is just like how many people

02:15:55.000 --> 02:15:57.000
have really stuck with us for

02:15:57.000 --> 02:15:59.000
um as long you know and I realized

02:15:59.000 --> 02:16:01.000
people come and people go and I

02:16:01.000 --> 02:16:03.000
I know I name checked um

02:16:03.000 --> 02:16:05.000
toshin earlier in the show who was kind of like

02:16:05.000 --> 02:16:07.000
I think a listener back in the like all games

02:16:07.000 --> 02:16:09.000
days which was a while ago at this point

02:16:09.000 --> 02:16:11.000
right Boggs been around since about 2012

02:16:11.000 --> 02:16:13.000
um and so all games when did all games

02:16:13.000 --> 02:16:15.000
start all games started I think around 2006

02:16:15.000 --> 02:16:17.000
well I'm sorry when we joined all games

02:16:17.000 --> 02:16:19.000
around before that you know what I mean um

02:16:19.000 --> 02:16:21.000
our time with them started in like 2006

02:16:21.000 --> 02:16:23.000
so I mean just to think like

02:16:23.000 --> 02:16:25.000
oh my god like they were listening I'm a PSP

02:16:25.000 --> 02:16:27.000
how many years are really

02:16:27.000 --> 02:16:29.000
shminktastic was on the beat I'm telling you that

02:16:29.000 --> 02:16:31.000
PSP thing doesn't get enough

02:16:31.000 --> 02:16:33.000
credit I would say that that OLR

02:16:33.000 --> 02:16:35.000
PSP rest in peace because it's

02:16:35.000 --> 02:16:37.000
sadly it's no longer there because I mean

02:16:37.000 --> 02:16:39.000
why would it be but that

02:16:39.000 --> 02:16:41.000
OLR PSP probably brought

02:16:41.000 --> 02:16:43.000
more people to OLR

02:16:43.000 --> 02:16:45.000
than anything else in our history

02:16:45.000 --> 02:16:47.000
save for the launch of

02:16:47.000 --> 02:16:49.000
iTunes podcasting and us being

02:16:49.000 --> 02:16:51.000
one of the original shows in it that's

02:16:51.000 --> 02:16:53.000
probably the only thing I can

02:16:53.000 --> 02:16:55.000
think of there that really comes close

02:16:55.000 --> 02:16:57.000
so yeah

02:16:57.000 --> 02:16:59.000
that's and there's so many folks in chat yeah

02:16:59.000 --> 02:17:01.000
OLR PSP I listen on the

02:17:01.000 --> 02:17:03.000
PSP too fuck I wish I could make lightning

02:17:03.000 --> 02:17:05.000
strike twice too bad there wasn't an OLR

02:17:05.000 --> 02:17:07.000
Vita but it wasn't really the same thing on the

02:17:07.000 --> 02:17:09.000
Vita the PSP was different because

02:17:09.000 --> 02:17:11.000
we were really able to build

02:17:11.000 --> 02:17:13.000
something there that really felt like

02:17:13.000 --> 02:17:15.000
you were like unlocking a new

02:17:15.000 --> 02:17:17.000
ability within your PSP you know what I mean

02:17:17.000 --> 02:17:19.000
with the whole listing on shoutcast like

02:17:19.000 --> 02:17:21.000
a lot of people didn't really know how to do that and you made it

02:17:21.000 --> 02:17:23.000
so easy with that website and it

02:17:23.000 --> 02:17:25.000
looked really cool and was like built for a

02:17:25.000 --> 02:17:27.000
PSP of mine that I just think like

02:17:27.000 --> 02:17:29.000
yeah again anyway I

02:17:29.000 --> 02:17:31.000
just is it on like one of those like web

02:17:31.000 --> 02:17:33.000
archives or something the OLR PSP site

02:17:33.000 --> 02:17:35.000
it's gotta be like there's gotta be a way for

02:17:35.000 --> 02:17:37.000
you guys to see it and what it like for those

02:17:37.000 --> 02:17:39.000
have no idea what I'm talking about if you're like newer to the show

02:17:39.000 --> 02:17:41.000
because it really was for

02:17:41.000 --> 02:17:43.000
for the time it was really cool

02:17:43.000 --> 02:17:45.000
I'm actually trying to learn Swift

02:17:45.000 --> 02:17:47.000
so I can make

02:17:47.000 --> 02:17:49.000
an iOS app

02:17:49.000 --> 02:17:51.000
oh that'd be sweet for us

02:17:51.000 --> 02:17:53.000
I I'm just starting

02:17:53.000 --> 02:17:55.000
my research so

02:17:55.000 --> 02:17:57.000
I mean to be fair maybe all of fog network

02:17:57.000 --> 02:17:59.000
would want an app but yeah you know

02:17:59.000 --> 02:18:01.000
I started

02:18:01.000 --> 02:18:03.000
I mean I had started on the idea

02:18:03.000 --> 02:18:05.000
like a few years ago

02:18:05.000 --> 02:18:07.000
yeah it's just that they've

02:18:07.000 --> 02:18:09.000
changed so many things since then

02:18:09.000 --> 02:18:11.000
you gotta stay on top of that stuff

02:18:11.000 --> 02:18:13.000
it's outdone before you even

02:18:13.000 --> 02:18:15.000
know it so anyway

02:18:15.000 --> 02:18:17.000
big big thank you for that

02:18:17.000 --> 02:18:19.000
and yeah Bobby agrees it was worth

02:18:19.000 --> 02:18:21.000
breaking the rules for and I'm

02:18:21.000 --> 02:18:23.000
okay with that I really really am

02:18:23.000 --> 02:18:25.000
yeah I can post a link there's

02:18:25.000 --> 02:18:27.000
a way back oh is there is on the way back

02:18:27.000 --> 02:18:29.000
machine yeah sweet post that in chat

02:18:29.000 --> 02:18:31.000
that's awesome I love that

02:18:31.000 --> 02:18:33.000
anyway we are I did not get the

02:18:33.000 --> 02:18:35.000
studio on the freaking discord server actually

02:18:35.000 --> 02:18:37.000
before I take calls we do have at least

02:18:37.000 --> 02:18:39.000
one person in the green room did you want to

02:18:39.000 --> 02:18:41.000
do any last minute stories I know I had

02:18:41.000 --> 02:18:43.000
to cut sure I can talk about

02:18:43.000 --> 02:18:45.000
there do you like one story then we get to you remember

02:18:45.000 --> 02:18:47.000
that we talked a little bit about the overwatch

02:18:47.000 --> 02:18:49.000
kind of

02:18:49.000 --> 02:18:51.000
was it the

02:18:51.000 --> 02:18:53.000
thing that they were doing for the the mods

02:18:53.000 --> 02:18:55.000
and stuff like that so someone actually

02:18:55.000 --> 02:18:57.000
created of course a portal gun in there

02:18:57.000 --> 02:18:59.000
so now you can have your portal fun along

02:18:59.000 --> 02:19:01.000
with the

02:19:01.000 --> 02:19:03.000
as one of the game types in overwatch

02:19:03.000 --> 02:19:05.000
now so that's kind of neat that they have that

02:19:05.000 --> 02:19:07.000
that's cool I forgot to mention during my gaming week I actually

02:19:07.000 --> 02:19:09.000
played overwatch which I haven't played in a while but I was

02:19:09.000 --> 02:19:11.000
like oh shit that special event is

02:19:11.000 --> 02:19:13.000
about to run out and I haven't even done it yet so I

02:19:13.000 --> 02:19:15.000
went in and I did like the story mode and the use

02:19:15.000 --> 02:19:17.000
any hero mode and all that

02:19:17.000 --> 02:19:19.000
and the opening movie is kind of

02:19:19.000 --> 02:19:21.000
long this time but it's well done

02:19:21.000 --> 02:19:23.000
it's good I just wish like

02:19:23.000 --> 02:19:25.000
there's seriously only one character

02:19:25.000 --> 02:19:27.000
in the story mode version that I can play

02:19:27.000 --> 02:19:29.000
half decently and that's mercy

02:19:29.000 --> 02:19:31.000
I guess if if I was forced to

02:19:31.000 --> 02:19:33.000
I could kind of do Winston but I am

02:19:33.000 --> 02:19:35.000
terrible with Genji and Tracer

02:19:35.000 --> 02:19:37.000
terrible so but I mean

02:19:37.000 --> 02:19:39.000
I think it's cool that that's okay I'm terrible at the entire

02:19:39.000 --> 02:19:41.000
game

02:19:41.000 --> 02:19:43.000
that's fair

02:19:43.000 --> 02:19:45.000
let me

02:19:45.000 --> 02:19:47.000
answer that since you can ask questions in

02:19:47.000 --> 02:19:49.000
chat as well and then we'll get to a call here

02:19:49.000 --> 02:19:51.000
schmaketastic wants to know is Loki

02:19:51.000 --> 02:19:53.000
still doing any game coding last

02:19:53.000 --> 02:19:55.000
I heard he was messing around with C++ or

02:19:55.000 --> 02:19:57.000
something it's been a few months since I've tuned in

02:19:57.000 --> 02:19:59.000
well let me tell you

02:19:59.000 --> 02:20:01.000
so I guess some good notes

02:20:01.000 --> 02:20:03.000
the kid has written more games

02:20:03.000 --> 02:20:05.000
at this point than Loki has

02:20:05.000 --> 02:20:07.000
the kid

02:20:07.000 --> 02:20:09.000
the kid is doing coding actually

02:20:09.000 --> 02:20:11.000
which is pretty amazing and I

02:20:11.000 --> 02:20:13.000
hope at some point he'll have a game that

02:20:13.000 --> 02:20:15.000
we want to say hey y'all should go check

02:20:15.000 --> 02:20:17.000
this out we made a game

02:20:17.000 --> 02:20:19.000
about John Cena memes it was pretty awesome

02:20:19.000 --> 02:20:21.000
he's kind of gotten done with doing John Cena

02:20:21.000 --> 02:20:23.000
stuff in fact that's actually it's funny

02:20:23.000 --> 02:20:25.000
like we were no we had that

02:20:25.000 --> 02:20:27.000
conversation the other day about like

02:20:27.000 --> 02:20:29.000
um

02:20:29.000 --> 02:20:31.000
because the owner of the I always talk to the owner

02:20:31.000 --> 02:20:33.000
of the place when I'm there

02:20:33.000 --> 02:20:35.000
and he's like yeah I've noticed that he's

02:20:35.000 --> 02:20:37.000
stopped putting John Cena in every single

02:20:37.000 --> 02:20:39.000
one of his games that he submits

02:20:39.000 --> 02:20:41.000
so

02:20:41.000 --> 02:20:43.000
so he's doing like no he

02:20:43.000 --> 02:20:45.000
he finished one now it's it

02:20:45.000 --> 02:20:47.000
was called Dragon Racing so they had

02:20:47.000 --> 02:20:49.000
the like you have the race dragon

02:20:49.000 --> 02:20:51.000
around like a little track thing

02:20:51.000 --> 02:20:53.000
he has to do one now it's called

02:20:53.000 --> 02:20:55.000
uh because Ninja

02:20:55.000 --> 02:20:57.000
Invaders it's basically he has to create

02:20:57.000 --> 02:20:59.000
a ninja character that

02:20:59.000 --> 02:21:01.000
move you move and avoid

02:21:01.000 --> 02:21:03.000
like stuff coming towards it kind of like

02:21:03.000 --> 02:21:05.000
a space shooter avoid object

02:21:05.000 --> 02:21:07.000
thing so he has to work on that

02:21:07.000 --> 02:21:09.000
so he's got about like he's about halfway

02:21:09.000 --> 02:21:11.000
through the white belt course and then

02:21:11.000 --> 02:21:13.000
he's gonna go through that he has to do

02:21:13.000 --> 02:21:15.000
some robotic stuff and then there's some they

02:21:15.000 --> 02:21:17.000
call improve yourselves which is basically

02:21:17.000 --> 02:21:19.000
here's a challenge but we're not gonna tell you how to do

02:21:19.000 --> 02:21:21.000
it you have to do it based on all of the

02:21:21.000 --> 02:21:23.000
knowledge that you have and it's kind of like a test

02:21:23.000 --> 02:21:25.000
and once he does that then he moves

02:21:25.000 --> 02:21:27.000
to yellow belt which is

02:21:27.000 --> 02:21:29.000
then um JavaScript

02:21:29.000 --> 02:21:31.000
so he's gonna start getting in JavaScript and

02:21:31.000 --> 02:21:33.000
you guys have to remember because if you haven't listened

02:21:33.000 --> 02:21:35.000
in a while you might not recall Loki's

02:21:35.000 --> 02:21:37.000
kid is eight yeah eight years old

02:21:37.000 --> 02:21:39.000
and this this is what they're doing now

02:21:39.000 --> 02:21:41.000
when I was eight years old we

02:21:41.000 --> 02:21:43.000
were plunking around on an Apple 2e doing

02:21:43.000 --> 02:21:45.000
logo not the television

02:21:45.000 --> 02:21:47.000
network the pen

02:21:47.000 --> 02:21:49.000
down forward 30

02:21:49.000 --> 02:21:51.000
pen up when I

02:21:51.000 --> 02:21:53.000
was eight years old I was learning French

02:21:53.000 --> 02:21:55.000
if I

02:21:55.000 --> 02:21:57.000
look if I look here I probably

02:21:57.000 --> 02:21:59.000
could post a couple of his games in chat because

02:21:59.000 --> 02:22:01.000
I get linked on them every single time

02:22:01.000 --> 02:22:03.000
that he uh he goes

02:22:03.000 --> 02:22:05.000
in there I just they go into that parent portal and

02:22:05.000 --> 02:22:07.000
I can show you some of the stuff he's been

02:22:07.000 --> 02:22:09.000
working on

02:22:09.000 --> 02:22:11.000
but it's cool it's

02:22:11.000 --> 02:22:13.000
not not to make fun of him or anything

02:22:13.000 --> 02:22:15.000
a lot of it's very obnoxious

02:22:15.000 --> 02:22:17.000
it's a kid usually when we like

02:22:17.000 --> 02:22:19.000
laugh at that stuff it's like oh my gosh I can't believe

02:22:19.000 --> 02:22:21.000
what kids are doing I can't believe like what kids

02:22:21.000 --> 02:22:23.000
like are are into but as far as

02:22:23.000 --> 02:22:25.000
your own personal coding

02:22:25.000 --> 02:22:27.000
uh you have he has yet to release

02:22:27.000 --> 02:22:29.000
anything that uh is

02:22:29.000 --> 02:22:31.000
is I did see the time to car

02:22:31.000 --> 02:22:33.000
thing I did get to see that at one point

02:22:33.000 --> 02:22:35.000
it's on YouTube oh yeah that's right you did put it

02:22:35.000 --> 02:22:37.000
on YouTube it's on it's on my YouTube channel

02:22:37.000 --> 02:22:39.000
uh YouTube Lokiolar

02:22:39.000 --> 02:22:41.000
you can check it out it's really old the reason

02:22:41.000 --> 02:22:43.000
I didn't release it because it wasn't fun

02:22:43.000 --> 02:22:45.000
and I had I would have had to I wanted

02:22:45.000 --> 02:22:47.000
to redo the whole thing

02:22:47.000 --> 02:22:49.000
I just it kind of got like

02:22:49.000 --> 02:22:51.000
it I lost the scope of what I was trying

02:22:51.000 --> 02:22:53.000
to do with it and then

02:22:53.000 --> 02:22:55.000
it just became too weird and

02:22:55.000 --> 02:22:57.000
so I decided to um

02:22:57.000 --> 02:22:59.000
I'm not gonna work on it until I have a clear idea

02:22:59.000 --> 02:23:01.000
of what I'm gonna do so

02:23:01.000 --> 02:23:03.000
I'm working on something else right now instead

02:23:03.000 --> 02:23:05.000
all right well let's get to

02:23:05.000 --> 02:23:07.000
some calls uh or at least a call because we do

02:23:07.000 --> 02:23:09.000
have somebody uh waiting there in the green room

02:23:09.000 --> 02:23:11.000
that wants to be on the show so let's bring them on

02:23:11.000 --> 02:23:13.000
hello you're on Orange Laundry Radio who's this

02:23:13.000 --> 02:23:15.000
you're out this is Metal Mayhem

02:23:15.000 --> 02:23:17.000
well hello Metal Mayhem what's on your mind

02:23:17.000 --> 02:23:19.000
tonight I just called you mayhem

02:23:19.000 --> 02:23:21.000
I called you a may-ham

02:23:21.000 --> 02:23:23.000
ham sorry about

02:23:23.000 --> 02:23:25.000
it may-ham mayhem

02:23:25.000 --> 02:23:27.000
well better than

02:23:27.000 --> 02:23:29.000
June beef right

02:23:29.000 --> 02:23:31.000
all right what's on your mind tonight

02:23:31.000 --> 02:23:33.000
uh well since you

02:23:33.000 --> 02:23:35.000
kind of sort of touched it on

02:23:35.000 --> 02:23:37.000
briefly in passing now

02:23:37.000 --> 02:23:39.000
a short while ago I thought I'd

02:23:39.000 --> 02:23:41.000
call about arcade 1-up

02:23:41.000 --> 02:23:43.000
um now

02:23:43.000 --> 02:23:45.000
you know I haven't

02:23:45.000 --> 02:23:47.000
seen these machines in person

02:23:47.000 --> 02:23:49.000
myself but obviously

02:23:49.000 --> 02:23:51.000
you and Loki and

02:23:51.000 --> 02:23:53.000
uh Dark Soccer have so

02:23:53.000 --> 02:23:55.000
um

02:23:55.000 --> 02:23:57.000
my question is

02:23:57.000 --> 02:23:59.000
for a little

02:23:59.000 --> 02:24:01.000
exposition obviously I know they're gonna

02:24:01.000 --> 02:24:03.000
be a little bit different than the

02:24:03.000 --> 02:24:05.000
actual arcade originals

02:24:05.000 --> 02:24:07.000
they're gonna be smaller chances are they

02:24:07.000 --> 02:24:09.000
don't accept quarters

02:24:09.000 --> 02:24:11.000
or tokens or anything like that

02:24:11.000 --> 02:24:13.000
but even with that being said

02:24:13.000 --> 02:24:15.000
now if you're

02:24:15.000 --> 02:24:17.000
not in the position to get

02:24:17.000 --> 02:24:19.000
the actual arcade machine for

02:24:19.000 --> 02:24:21.000
one ever reason

02:24:21.000 --> 02:24:23.000
you know would you recommend

02:24:23.000 --> 02:24:25.000
you know people go out and get

02:24:25.000 --> 02:24:27.000
these machines is like uh

02:24:27.000 --> 02:24:29.000
alternative to the original machine

02:24:29.000 --> 02:24:31.000
um

02:24:31.000 --> 02:24:33.000
as an alternative to the original machine

02:24:33.000 --> 02:24:35.000
it depends if you're a collector

02:24:35.000 --> 02:24:37.000
I don't think anything's gonna replace the

02:24:37.000 --> 02:24:39.000
original machine as far as like collector

02:24:39.000 --> 02:24:41.000
value and goes but if you're just somebody

02:24:41.000 --> 02:24:43.000
like looking to enhance your game

02:24:43.000 --> 02:24:45.000
room or your fun space

02:24:45.000 --> 02:24:47.000
like a like especially like maybe if you have

02:24:47.000 --> 02:24:49.000
like a community game room if you have like a

02:24:49.000 --> 02:24:51.000
HOA or an apartment complex or something has like

02:24:51.000 --> 02:24:53.000
a standard game room and you're looking to like

02:24:53.000 --> 02:24:55.000
enrich that a little bit I think one of these machines would be

02:24:55.000 --> 02:24:57.000
really like an adorable way to do that now

02:24:57.000 --> 02:24:59.000
since you haven't seen them in person but by the way

02:24:59.000 --> 02:25:01.000
my well at least a local

02:25:01.000 --> 02:25:03.000
Walmart to here has them on

02:25:03.000 --> 02:25:05.000
display now I don't think that means

02:25:05.000 --> 02:25:07.000
every Walmart has them on display

02:25:07.000 --> 02:25:09.000
but I know one near here does so if you

02:25:09.000 --> 02:25:11.000
have a large Walmart near to you somewhere

02:25:11.000 --> 02:25:13.000
um you might be able to go and

02:25:13.000 --> 02:25:15.000
uh see that so I

02:25:15.000 --> 02:25:17.000
check that out and also um Costco

02:25:17.000 --> 02:25:19.000
here sells them now I don't have

02:25:19.000 --> 02:25:21.000
a Costco membership but somebody sent me

02:25:21.000 --> 02:25:23.000
a text the other day going hey I thought

02:25:23.000 --> 02:25:25.000
of you because I saw this at Costco so I know

02:25:25.000 --> 02:25:27.000
they're selling them there too is Costco nationwide

02:25:27.000 --> 02:25:29.000
nationwide or is that just west coast

02:25:29.000 --> 02:25:31.000
they're nationwide okay they're nationwide so

02:25:31.000 --> 02:25:33.000
check that too um

02:25:33.000 --> 02:25:35.000
so you may be able to see one in person

02:25:35.000 --> 02:25:37.000
if you if you head to one of those stores I imagine

02:25:37.000 --> 02:25:39.000
they're going to be showing up more places soon

02:25:39.000 --> 02:25:41.000
because there's really no describing it like seeing

02:25:41.000 --> 02:25:43.000
one in person although you could probably see some YouTubes

02:25:43.000 --> 02:25:45.000
and they probably do a good job at explaining

02:25:45.000 --> 02:25:47.000
it as well um they are

02:25:47.000 --> 02:25:49.000
smaller they're not like the original cabinet

02:25:49.000 --> 02:25:51.000
um because I would say imagine

02:25:51.000 --> 02:25:53.000
more like a bar top if you've ever been to

02:25:53.000 --> 02:25:55.000
a bar and you see something that's like kind of like

02:25:55.000 --> 02:25:57.000
sitting on top of the bar it's kind of more like

02:25:57.000 --> 02:25:59.000
that but it's probably like

02:25:59.000 --> 02:26:01.000
I would say it has a little more height to

02:26:01.000 --> 02:26:03.000
it it kind of goes up a little bit it's a little more

02:26:03.000 --> 02:26:05.000
skinnier like an arcade cabinet but it goes

02:26:05.000 --> 02:26:07.000
up a little bit and then um you know it's

02:26:07.000 --> 02:26:09.000
just not the size of a full size it's

02:26:09.000 --> 02:26:11.000
meant to be put like on the bar

02:26:11.000 --> 02:26:13.000
and then you sit there on a stool and play

02:26:13.000 --> 02:26:15.000
the game that way it's not meant to be something you put on

02:26:15.000 --> 02:26:17.000
the ground because if you put it on the ground it wouldn't

02:26:17.000 --> 02:26:19.000
come up past your kneecaps okay

02:26:19.000 --> 02:26:21.000
whereas the original arcade machine would come

02:26:21.000 --> 02:26:23.000
up the full size um

02:26:23.000 --> 02:26:25.000
the thing I noticed right off the bat

02:26:25.000 --> 02:26:27.000
as being very different is the monitor

02:26:27.000 --> 02:26:29.000
because they have a very kind of like

02:26:29.000 --> 02:26:31.000
cheap but modern monitor

02:26:31.000 --> 02:26:33.000
in there and I think one thing you have to remember

02:26:33.000 --> 02:26:35.000
is that a lot of these games like Mortal

02:26:35.000 --> 02:26:37.000
Combat like I don't know what are even

02:26:37.000 --> 02:26:39.000
in these things Crystal Castles

02:26:39.000 --> 02:26:41.000
like old school Asteroids, Tempest

02:26:41.000 --> 02:26:43.000
those type of games they all played on

02:26:43.000 --> 02:26:45.000
CRT televisions and that's not

02:26:45.000 --> 02:26:47.000
what's powering these things these are like

02:26:47.000 --> 02:26:49.000
flat screen TVs in those so

02:26:49.000 --> 02:26:51.000
that's the first thing I noticed

02:26:51.000 --> 02:26:53.000
that's different is that oh this looks

02:26:53.000 --> 02:26:55.000
different because it's not like a CRT

02:26:55.000 --> 02:26:57.000
which is a very kind of distinct look to

02:26:57.000 --> 02:26:59.000
it versus you know a more modern

02:26:59.000 --> 02:27:01.000
flat screen television so I think

02:27:01.000 --> 02:27:03.000
for me right there that's like the biggest

02:27:03.000 --> 02:27:05.000
difference you're going to notice but that's also

02:27:05.000 --> 02:27:07.000
how they make these things not cost

02:27:07.000 --> 02:27:09.000
a couple thousand dollars which

02:27:09.000 --> 02:27:11.000
if you're a collector trying to collect a machine

02:27:11.000 --> 02:27:13.000
I don't know Jamie you may know

02:27:13.000 --> 02:27:15.000
more about this than I do I know you guys collect pinball

02:27:15.000 --> 02:27:17.000
machines and not arcade machines but

02:27:17.000 --> 02:27:19.000
do you have any idea like ballpark what an

02:27:19.000 --> 02:27:21.000
80's arcade machine might cost somebody?

02:27:21.000 --> 02:27:23.000
Depends on the machine I mean really

02:27:23.000 --> 02:27:25.000
because it depends on rarity it depends

02:27:25.000 --> 02:27:27.000
on if it is a mod

02:27:27.000 --> 02:27:29.000
a lot of machines were modded and people

02:27:29.000 --> 02:27:31.000
will buy the modded machines and try to

02:27:31.000 --> 02:27:33.000
restore them back to original

02:27:33.000 --> 02:27:35.000
when we picked up our pole position

02:27:35.000 --> 02:27:37.000
now it was in shitty condition

02:27:37.000 --> 02:27:39.000
but we picked up our pole position

02:27:39.000 --> 02:27:41.000
for I want to say 200

02:27:41.000 --> 02:27:43.000
that's not bad

02:27:43.000 --> 02:27:45.000
yeah it was pretty crappy

02:27:45.000 --> 02:27:47.000
I remember Shermie lived in it for a

02:27:47.000 --> 02:27:49.000
little while remember yeah I do

02:27:49.000 --> 02:27:51.000
I do and you guys put a main thing

02:27:51.000 --> 02:27:53.000
in that right we did we did

02:27:53.000 --> 02:27:55.000
we also now

02:27:55.000 --> 02:27:57.000
keep in mind our gyrus was free

02:27:57.000 --> 02:27:59.000
because it needed

02:27:59.000 --> 02:28:01.000
a fuse replaced and the owner didn't want to do

02:28:01.000 --> 02:28:03.000
it or you didn't know how to fix it

02:28:03.000 --> 02:28:05.000
we got our blastroids

02:28:05.000 --> 02:28:07.000
I want to say for 50 I mean

02:28:07.000 --> 02:28:09.000
we've since sold both of these now

02:28:09.000 --> 02:28:11.000
I think for 500 for the pair

02:28:11.000 --> 02:28:13.000
because we needed room

02:28:13.000 --> 02:28:15.000
but

02:28:15.000 --> 02:28:17.000
I mean it just really depends

02:28:17.000 --> 02:28:19.000
a good way actually

02:28:19.000 --> 02:28:21.000
to learn some of these prices is a channel

02:28:21.000 --> 02:28:23.000
that Dan and I watch is TNT Amusements

02:28:23.000 --> 02:28:25.000
out on the East Coast

02:28:25.000 --> 02:28:27.000
I'm trying to remember where exactly

02:28:27.000 --> 02:28:29.000
but you know he'll go through

02:28:29.000 --> 02:28:31.000
and he'll say what the prices you know they show some

02:28:31.000 --> 02:28:33.000
of the repair process on some of the machines

02:28:33.000 --> 02:28:35.000
and they talk about the pricing

02:28:35.000 --> 02:28:37.000
and you know what a discounted price

02:28:37.000 --> 02:28:39.000
would be and what he picks

02:28:39.000 --> 02:28:41.000
up these things for and the work that goes into him

02:28:41.000 --> 02:28:43.000
I get a really good

02:28:43.000 --> 02:28:45.000
gauge just watching his YouTube

02:28:45.000 --> 02:28:47.000
channel so

02:28:47.000 --> 02:28:49.000
now I do want to respond

02:28:49.000 --> 02:28:51.000
because I'm finally looking at chat and some of the

02:28:51.000 --> 02:28:53.000
input you guys are making there first off

02:28:53.000 --> 02:28:55.000
Costco is apparently not just nationwide

02:28:55.000 --> 02:28:57.000
but it's in Mexico too according to Act F so it's

02:28:57.000 --> 02:28:59.000
international so I really don't know what I'm talking about

02:28:59.000 --> 02:29:01.000
and then

02:29:01.000 --> 02:29:03.000
let's see S2100 Matt I thought had some good advice

02:29:03.000 --> 02:29:05.000
here your best bet for getting machines

02:29:05.000 --> 02:29:07.000
at a good price look for

02:29:07.000 --> 02:29:09.000
auctions sometimes you'll get

02:29:09.000 --> 02:29:11.000
a good deal I remember YYR

02:29:11.000 --> 02:29:13.000
got his DDR machine for a good price

02:29:13.000 --> 02:29:15.000
at an auction so that's

02:29:15.000 --> 02:29:17.000
that's a good way to think about it too not that

02:29:17.000 --> 02:29:19.000
I'm saying you're running out there to collect arcade machines

02:29:19.000 --> 02:29:21.000
Metal Mayhem but you never you never know

02:29:21.000 --> 02:29:23.000
especially sometimes it's just about

02:29:23.000 --> 02:29:25.000
like who you know and what have you

02:29:25.000 --> 02:29:27.000
just like Dark Tips

02:29:27.000 --> 02:29:29.000
I'm sorry I'm looking for chat while I'm talking

02:29:29.000 --> 02:29:31.000
Dark Sakura

02:29:31.000 --> 02:29:33.000
I'm looking at chat while I'm

02:29:33.000 --> 02:29:35.000
Dark Sakura mentioned

02:29:35.000 --> 02:29:37.000
that they got a free one just because

02:29:37.000 --> 02:29:39.000
you know lazy owner space

02:29:39.000 --> 02:29:41.000
as far as the owner was concerned you'd be surprised

02:29:41.000 --> 02:29:43.000
where you can find stuff I found my DDR

02:29:43.000 --> 02:29:45.000
cabinet on Facebook marketplace

02:29:45.000 --> 02:29:47.000
so yeah wow I got a great

02:29:47.000 --> 02:29:49.000
deal on that

02:29:49.000 --> 02:29:51.000
it's crazy

02:29:51.000 --> 02:29:53.000
I did a little bit of

02:29:53.000 --> 02:29:55.000
basic research for actual

02:29:55.000 --> 02:29:57.000
arcade machines being

02:29:57.000 --> 02:29:59.000
sold in my area

02:29:59.000 --> 02:30:01.000
for those that don't remember

02:30:01.000 --> 02:30:03.000
or are relatively new to the show

02:30:03.000 --> 02:30:05.000
I live in the western New

02:30:05.000 --> 02:30:07.000
York area

02:30:07.000 --> 02:30:09.000
and you know

02:30:09.000 --> 02:30:11.000
the cities in western

02:30:11.000 --> 02:30:13.000
New York are nowhere as big as Sacramento

02:30:13.000 --> 02:30:15.000
or LA or anything like that

02:30:15.000 --> 02:30:17.000
so

02:30:17.000 --> 02:30:19.000
my choices for

02:30:19.000 --> 02:30:21.000
places that sell

02:30:21.000 --> 02:30:23.000
are rather limited

02:30:23.000 --> 02:30:25.000
and now the ones that I constantly

02:30:25.000 --> 02:30:27.000
see being advertised

02:30:27.000 --> 02:30:29.000
they have been restored and whatnot

02:30:29.000 --> 02:30:31.000
typically regardless

02:30:31.000 --> 02:30:33.000
of the machine

02:30:33.000 --> 02:30:35.000
they're being sold for roughly two and a half

02:30:35.000 --> 02:30:37.000
grand

02:30:37.000 --> 02:30:39.000
as much as I would like an

02:30:39.000 --> 02:30:41.000
actual

02:30:41.000 --> 02:30:43.000
same working order and all that

02:30:43.000 --> 02:30:45.000
two and a half bands way

02:30:45.000 --> 02:30:47.000
out of my price range

02:30:47.000 --> 02:30:49.000
so I kind of figure

02:30:49.000 --> 02:30:51.000
if I can't do two and a half grand

02:30:53.000 --> 02:30:55.000
if I remember right you said these

02:30:55.000 --> 02:30:57.000
arcade one ups

02:30:57.000 --> 02:30:59.000
are being sold for roughly

02:30:59.000 --> 02:31:01.000
about two hundred dollars right?

02:31:01.000 --> 02:31:03.000
I can't figure

02:31:03.000 --> 02:31:05.000
two hundred dollars is still a little bit of a stretch

02:31:05.000 --> 02:31:07.000
about two hundred dollars

02:31:07.000 --> 02:31:09.000
is still

02:31:09.000 --> 02:31:11.000
way more affordable

02:31:11.000 --> 02:31:13.000
it's doable

02:31:13.000 --> 02:31:15.000
it's about the same price

02:31:15.000 --> 02:31:17.000
what a console would cost you

02:31:17.000 --> 02:31:19.000
you're only going to get a handful of games

02:31:19.000 --> 02:31:21.000
so they have to be games that really mean something to you

02:31:21.000 --> 02:31:23.000
but it could be worth it

02:31:23.000 --> 02:31:25.000
yeah

02:31:25.000 --> 02:31:27.000
if I like

02:31:27.000 --> 02:31:29.000
if I really

02:31:29.000 --> 02:31:31.000
go

02:31:31.000 --> 02:31:33.000
and save up

02:31:33.000 --> 02:31:35.000
like living on nothing

02:31:35.000 --> 02:31:37.000
but ramen and

02:31:37.000 --> 02:31:39.000
air and water for like

02:31:39.000 --> 02:31:41.000
years then maybe just

02:31:41.000 --> 02:31:43.000
maybe with a little

02:31:43.000 --> 02:31:45.000
luck maybe I can

02:31:45.000 --> 02:31:47.000
pass away for the actual arcade machine

02:31:47.000 --> 02:31:49.000
at like two and a half grand but

02:31:49.000 --> 02:31:51.000
I wouldn't hold my breath on that

02:31:51.000 --> 02:31:53.000
I don't think any

02:31:53.000 --> 02:31:55.000
arcade machine is worth starving yourself

02:31:55.000 --> 02:31:57.000
for but you know if you

02:31:57.000 --> 02:31:59.000
you find things in your budget

02:31:59.000 --> 02:32:01.000
to cut back on you'd be surprised

02:32:01.000 --> 02:32:03.000
how long am I to err how

02:32:03.000 --> 02:32:05.000
not so long am I taking to save for some things

02:32:05.000 --> 02:32:07.000
you know what I mean

02:32:07.000 --> 02:32:09.000
I mean you know the computer that I'm on

02:32:09.000 --> 02:32:11.000
right now you know that was

02:32:11.000 --> 02:32:13.000
relatively cheap but I literally

02:32:13.000 --> 02:32:15.000
had to live on like a shoe sticking out

02:32:15.000 --> 02:32:17.000
budget for like three months

02:32:17.000 --> 02:32:19.000
to get to get the money for that and that was

02:32:19.000 --> 02:32:21.000
only like roughly four hundred

02:32:21.000 --> 02:32:23.000
fifty dollars so

02:32:23.000 --> 02:32:25.000
yeah all right well

02:32:25.000 --> 02:32:27.000
you know I took away too much of

02:32:27.000 --> 02:32:29.000
the time so I'll clear up reliance for

02:32:29.000 --> 02:32:31.000
somewhere else so you know I was calling

02:32:31.000 --> 02:32:33.000
but thanks for taking my call don't worry

02:32:33.000 --> 02:32:35.000
about it it was a good topic you take care okay

02:32:35.000 --> 02:32:37.000
you too take care yep

02:32:37.000 --> 02:32:39.000
all right so we are about

02:32:39.000 --> 02:32:41.000
to get to our next call here

02:32:41.000 --> 02:32:43.000
dar Tutsi agreeing in our chat yeah the one ups

02:32:43.000 --> 02:32:45.000
might be good if you don't want to get your hands

02:32:45.000 --> 02:32:47.000
dirty with repairs

02:32:47.000 --> 02:32:49.000
all right well we're going to take another call here I see

02:32:49.000 --> 02:32:51.000
another person in the green room so I'm going to bring him into

02:32:51.000 --> 02:32:53.000
the on air channel and say

02:32:53.000 --> 02:32:55.000
hello you're on orange launch radio who's this

02:32:55.000 --> 02:32:57.000
hey it's make tastic

02:32:57.000 --> 02:32:59.000
hey hi there

02:32:59.000 --> 02:33:01.000
you're the one that just sent that very

02:33:01.000 --> 02:33:03.000
kind donation thank you so much how can

02:33:03.000 --> 02:33:05.000
how can I not take your call tonight

02:33:05.000 --> 02:33:07.000
how are you oh it's no worries

02:33:07.000 --> 02:33:09.000
I'm doing great little under the weather but

02:33:09.000 --> 02:33:11.000
yikes yeah

02:33:11.000 --> 02:33:13.000
just I don't have anything

02:33:13.000 --> 02:33:15.000
relevant topic wise to say but

02:33:15.000 --> 02:33:17.000
just wanted to say you know I've been listening since I

02:33:17.000 --> 02:33:19.000
was 15 back when RSS feeds

02:33:19.000 --> 02:33:21.000
on the PSP were still a thing

02:33:21.000 --> 02:33:23.000
I'm 28 now so

02:33:23.000 --> 02:33:25.000
that kind of dates me a little bit there but

02:33:25.000 --> 02:33:27.000
uh I think my first memory

02:33:27.000 --> 02:33:29.000
of you all was uh when you weren't

02:33:29.000 --> 02:33:31.000
mentioning how long you all have been on the air

02:33:31.000 --> 02:33:33.000
or a podcast rather

02:33:33.000 --> 02:33:35.000
and dark soccer held up her fingers and said

02:33:35.000 --> 02:33:37.000
we're this many and you were all like oh

02:33:37.000 --> 02:33:39.000
yeah great radio dark soccer

02:33:39.000 --> 02:33:41.000
they're holding up your fingers

02:33:41.000 --> 02:33:43.000
isn't isn't that ironic

02:33:43.000 --> 02:33:45.000
now that we're on twitch so

02:33:45.000 --> 02:33:47.000
dark soccer hold up how many fingers

02:33:47.000 --> 02:33:49.000
with how old the show is

02:33:49.000 --> 02:33:51.000
they can't see they can't see that no

02:33:51.000 --> 02:33:53.000
we're more than one dark

02:33:53.000 --> 02:33:55.000
multiply that by 17

02:33:55.000 --> 02:33:57.000
all right

02:33:57.000 --> 02:33:59.000
noted noted yeah

02:33:59.000 --> 02:34:01.000
with love with love

02:34:01.000 --> 02:34:03.000
I've called in and emailed

02:34:03.000 --> 02:34:05.000
in under several different aliases

02:34:05.000 --> 02:34:07.000
could never really stick to one so

02:34:07.000 --> 02:34:09.000
this is one I actually can stick to

02:34:09.000 --> 02:34:11.000
because I've had it since I was a teenager

02:34:11.000 --> 02:34:13.000
but um yeah I mean

02:34:13.000 --> 02:34:15.000
I've called I remember emailing in

02:34:15.000 --> 02:34:17.000
one day when I was a teen and

02:34:17.000 --> 02:34:19.000
real lonely angsty teen and how I

02:34:19.000 --> 02:34:21.000
sent in an email stating how the show really

02:34:21.000 --> 02:34:23.000
got me through the day when my dog died

02:34:23.000 --> 02:34:25.000
stuff like that

02:34:25.000 --> 02:34:27.000
I just uh

02:34:27.000 --> 02:34:29.000
I just want to thank you all for uh

02:34:29.000 --> 02:34:31.000
keeping at it for

02:34:31.000 --> 02:34:33.000
this long too that's just

02:34:33.000 --> 02:34:35.000
kind of unprecedented I mean

02:34:35.000 --> 02:34:37.000
I kind of I kind of joke

02:34:37.000 --> 02:34:39.000
about this sometimes but the story that

02:34:39.000 --> 02:34:41.000
you kind of gave there is that like I've been

02:34:41.000 --> 02:34:43.000
listening since I was 15 and now I'm 28

02:34:43.000 --> 02:34:45.000
you know it's it's it's

02:34:45.000 --> 02:34:47.000
like the best thing to hear at the same

02:34:47.000 --> 02:34:49.000
time being the worst thing to hear

02:34:49.000 --> 02:34:51.000
right yeah it's kind of uh

02:34:51.000 --> 02:34:53.000
no but I love it I love

02:34:53.000 --> 02:34:55.000
no I do I do like but the

02:34:55.000 --> 02:34:57.000
fact that uh we just make fun of

02:34:57.000 --> 02:34:59.000
it because it's obviously a reminder of like oh

02:34:59.000 --> 02:35:01.000
yeah I was 24 when I started this and now

02:35:01.000 --> 02:35:03.000
I'm um not

02:35:03.000 --> 02:35:05.000
um but uh don't even

02:35:05.000 --> 02:35:07.000
the the fact that

02:35:07.000 --> 02:35:09.000
many of you have stuck with this as long

02:35:09.000 --> 02:35:11.000
as you have I mean it's it's the reason

02:35:11.000 --> 02:35:13.000
why we keep showing up on Sunday night you know

02:35:13.000 --> 02:35:15.000
we're not we're not a huge show

02:35:15.000 --> 02:35:17.000
we don't we don't got the ratings a giant

02:35:17.000 --> 02:35:19.000
bomb or um I don't

02:35:19.000 --> 02:35:21.000
what are even the big gaming podcast I don't even

02:35:21.000 --> 02:35:23.000
know anymore a lot of them just kind of come

02:35:23.000 --> 02:35:25.000
and go but anyway

02:35:25.000 --> 02:35:27.000
because y'all are technically

02:35:27.000 --> 02:35:29.000
first podcast I ever

02:35:29.000 --> 02:35:31.000
listened to so I don't want to say

02:35:31.000 --> 02:35:33.000
anything even remotely shady about gamertag

02:35:33.000 --> 02:35:35.000
though because Danny was very hard at what he

02:35:35.000 --> 02:35:37.000
does and deserves the success that

02:35:37.000 --> 02:35:39.000
he's getting and he's another indie guy so like

02:35:39.000 --> 02:35:41.000
I can't I can't shade or hate

02:35:41.000 --> 02:35:43.000
on that in any single way uh

02:35:43.000 --> 02:35:45.000
but I will always throw shade at the corporate people involved

02:35:45.000 --> 02:35:47.000
um so uh

02:35:47.000 --> 02:35:49.000
yeah but um gosh thank you

02:35:49.000 --> 02:35:51.000
thank you so much for um just

02:35:51.000 --> 02:35:53.000
being here and and uh

02:35:53.000 --> 02:35:55.000
being with us and giving us the motivation

02:35:55.000 --> 02:35:57.000
to show up like people people

02:35:57.000 --> 02:35:59.000
often ask us like how do you keep

02:35:59.000 --> 02:36:01.000
going for 17 years

02:36:01.000 --> 02:36:03.000
and there's several different

02:36:03.000 --> 02:36:05.000
well I mean you say

02:36:05.000 --> 02:36:07.000
that well you say that tongue in cheek

02:36:07.000 --> 02:36:09.000
but there's definitely a part of me that goes

02:36:09.000 --> 02:36:11.000
like the Sunday nights when

02:36:11.000 --> 02:36:13.000
OLR isn't here

02:36:13.000 --> 02:36:15.000
when something pre-planned isn't

02:36:15.000 --> 02:36:17.000
going on like um let's say like we had a show

02:36:17.000 --> 02:36:19.000
cut out because of a technical issue or something like

02:36:19.000 --> 02:36:21.000
I I really didn't want to take the show off but we had like a

02:36:21.000 --> 02:36:23.000
technical issue or something um

02:36:23.000 --> 02:36:25.000
and it just feels weird

02:36:25.000 --> 02:36:27.000
I'm like sitting there going what do I do

02:36:27.000 --> 02:36:29.000
I guess I'll watch Game of Thrones or something

02:36:29.000 --> 02:36:31.000
no I'm not even that bored so you know

02:36:31.000 --> 02:36:33.000
it's like I don't know what to do um

02:36:33.000 --> 02:36:35.000
but just also the fact that there's so many

02:36:35.000 --> 02:36:37.000
of you out there

02:36:37.000 --> 02:36:39.000
and I say so many and again it's not

02:36:39.000 --> 02:36:41.000
like thousands and thousands

02:36:41.000 --> 02:36:43.000
it's maybe dozens and dozens

02:36:43.000 --> 02:36:45.000
but that's still something to me

02:36:45.000 --> 02:36:47.000
the fact that even one person

02:36:47.000 --> 02:36:49.000
would like turn up and like

02:36:49.000 --> 02:36:51.000
give a shit about our discussions

02:36:51.000 --> 02:36:53.000
that we're having here and our stories

02:36:53.000 --> 02:36:55.000
and our angles and things like that like that's just like

02:36:55.000 --> 02:36:57.000
that's all the motivation in the world

02:36:57.000 --> 02:36:59.000
and that's something that's kept this show being fed

02:36:59.000 --> 02:37:01.000
for 17 years and we'll

02:37:01.000 --> 02:37:03.000
keep the show being fed until

02:37:03.000 --> 02:37:05.000
one day we just have

02:37:05.000 --> 02:37:07.000
to pull the plug for whatever reason

02:37:07.000 --> 02:37:09.000
whatever that reason may be that I don't want to think of yet

02:37:09.000 --> 02:37:11.000
right you know I've dropped

02:37:11.000 --> 02:37:13.000
in and out of several different podcasts

02:37:13.000 --> 02:37:15.000
but this has been the one that I've

02:37:15.000 --> 02:37:17.000
stuck with for 12 years now

02:37:17.000 --> 02:37:19.000
I mean granted I'm never as

02:37:19.000 --> 02:37:21.000
consistent as I would like to be

02:37:21.000 --> 02:37:23.000
but you know

02:37:23.000 --> 02:37:25.000
y'all have been my

02:37:25.000 --> 02:37:27.000
getting me through

02:37:27.000 --> 02:37:29.000
you know to my commute to work

02:37:29.000 --> 02:37:31.000
and my commute home from where

02:37:31.000 --> 02:37:33.000
you know just always

02:37:33.000 --> 02:37:35.000
hearing your voices is a good thing

02:37:35.000 --> 02:37:37.000
and you guys really put on a great show

02:37:37.000 --> 02:37:39.000
and I just wanted to extend my gratitude

02:37:39.000 --> 02:37:41.000
well thank you so so much it's like

02:37:41.000 --> 02:37:43.000
super appreciated and you know

02:37:43.000 --> 02:37:45.000
I really do appreciate that thank you

02:37:45.000 --> 02:37:47.000
yeah if you can't listen every week it's like totally

02:37:47.000 --> 02:37:49.000
okay like you know some people will say like

02:37:49.000 --> 02:37:51.000
oh man I haven't been able to listen to

02:37:51.000 --> 02:37:53.000
OLR in like three months and I'm like

02:37:53.000 --> 02:37:55.000
it's cool like it really is

02:37:55.000 --> 02:37:57.000
like don't feel like you owe me an

02:37:57.000 --> 02:37:59.000
apology or something I'm here doing my

02:37:59.000 --> 02:38:01.000
thing with with our soccer and Loki

02:38:01.000 --> 02:38:03.000
and if you're able to make it out cool

02:38:03.000 --> 02:38:05.000
if not hey it happens

02:38:05.000 --> 02:38:07.000
but as I usually say at the end

02:38:07.000 --> 02:38:09.000
of the show and I'll just kind of remind everybody of it now

02:38:09.000 --> 02:38:11.000
if if OLR you decide one day it's

02:38:11.000 --> 02:38:13.000
not really for you anymore for whatever reason I just

02:38:13.000 --> 02:38:15.000
hope you support independent podcasts

02:38:15.000 --> 02:38:17.000
and please please

02:38:17.000 --> 02:38:19.000
please do not support celebrity

02:38:19.000 --> 02:38:21.000
podcasts that want to charge you

02:38:21.000 --> 02:38:23.000
$7.99 a month for the privilege

02:38:23.000 --> 02:38:25.000
of being able to listen to it

02:38:25.000 --> 02:38:27.000
that's all I'm going to say for the record

02:38:27.000 --> 02:38:29.000
if you do decide the podcast is no longer

02:38:29.000 --> 02:38:31.000
for you would like to know why

02:38:31.000 --> 02:38:33.000
honestly enough because

02:38:33.000 --> 02:38:35.000
I'm a firm believer that a complaint is a gift

02:38:35.000 --> 02:38:37.000
and if you

02:38:37.000 --> 02:38:39.000
have a problem with something that we do or say

02:38:39.000 --> 02:38:41.000
it'd be better to tell us right off the bat

02:38:41.000 --> 02:38:43.000
hopefully you know where we can discuss

02:38:43.000 --> 02:38:45.000
it so that you know

02:38:45.000 --> 02:38:47.000
we know what people

02:38:47.000 --> 02:38:49.000
aren't liking but to be clear

02:38:49.000 --> 02:38:51.000
because I have read some of those like iTunes reviews

02:38:51.000 --> 02:38:53.000
and things like that those don't count yeah things like

02:38:53.000 --> 02:38:55.000
Dark Soccer is a bitch

02:38:55.000 --> 02:38:57.000
or have there been more of those

02:38:57.000 --> 02:38:59.000
Rob not in years or

02:38:59.000 --> 02:39:01.000
Rob is annoying or whatever

02:39:01.000 --> 02:39:03.000
Loki is too loud or

02:39:03.000 --> 02:39:05.000
you play too much Pokemon Go like those things

02:39:05.000 --> 02:39:07.000
aren't going to help you know what I mean

02:39:07.000 --> 02:39:09.000
whatever yeah not very

02:39:09.000 --> 02:39:11.000
constructive criticism but it's

02:39:11.000 --> 02:39:13.000
also glad to hear that Dark Soccer is still

02:39:13.000 --> 02:39:15.000
playing Animal Crossing

02:39:15.000 --> 02:39:17.000
I'd like to think that Loki is still modding

02:39:17.000 --> 02:39:19.000
the shit out of GTA 5 or something

02:39:19.000 --> 02:39:21.000
um something

02:39:21.000 --> 02:39:23.000
I love my Animal Crossing

02:39:23.000 --> 02:39:25.000
though I'm so waiting for the Switch one

02:39:25.000 --> 02:39:27.000
right

02:39:27.000 --> 02:39:29.000
well uh that's really all I wanted to say guys

02:39:29.000 --> 02:39:31.000
so just keep kicking ass

02:39:57.000 --> 02:39:59.000
you're not already a hologram?

02:39:59.000 --> 02:40:01.000
alright I'll show you hologram

02:40:01.000 --> 02:40:03.000
take care shmaktastic thanks for being here

02:40:03.000 --> 02:40:05.000
later

02:40:05.000 --> 02:40:07.000
that was great

02:40:07.000 --> 02:40:09.000
alright I think we'll end on that note

02:40:09.000 --> 02:40:11.000
we're going to end on a happy note tonight

02:40:11.000 --> 02:40:13.000
although I will ask Loki if there's any other

02:40:13.000 --> 02:40:15.000
last minute stories he wants to see tonight

02:40:15.000 --> 02:40:17.000
nah I've been just watching videos of this

02:40:17.000 --> 02:40:19.000
of Dreams

02:40:19.000 --> 02:40:21.000
the medium molecules posting

02:40:21.000 --> 02:40:23.000
little big planet but PS4

02:40:23.000 --> 02:40:25.000
yeah the stuff that people are doing in like the

02:40:25.000 --> 02:40:27.000
past right now this game is going to

02:40:27.000 --> 02:40:29.000
catch a lot of people off guard it looks

02:40:29.000 --> 02:40:31.000
amazing I can't wait to play it but I feel

02:40:31.000 --> 02:40:33.000
like this they're not really

02:40:33.000 --> 02:40:35.000
explaining like when the game comes out I

02:40:35.000 --> 02:40:37.000
feel like it's like this secret thing

02:40:37.000 --> 02:40:39.000
that like you have to be part of the cool kids club to

02:40:39.000 --> 02:40:41.000
know like when when when can I walk

02:40:41.000 --> 02:40:43.000
into a target and buy

02:40:43.000 --> 02:40:45.000
the fucking game that's what I would like to

02:40:45.000 --> 02:40:47.000
know I don't know but it looks

02:40:47.000 --> 02:40:49.000
it looks awesome yeah it does look

02:40:49.000 --> 02:40:51.000
awesome like I'm all here for it but like

02:40:51.000 --> 02:40:53.000
you know let me buy your game

02:40:53.000 --> 02:40:55.000
that's all I'm asking I'm sure we'll

02:40:55.000 --> 02:40:57.000
see it at E3 well maybe

02:40:57.000 --> 02:40:59.000
cause Sony's not there

02:40:59.000 --> 02:41:01.000
so they might put something out

02:41:01.000 --> 02:41:03.000
they can just show this for the whole presentation

02:41:03.000 --> 02:41:05.000
alongside it I don't know they might do a

02:41:05.000 --> 02:41:07.000
direct-ish style thing

02:41:07.000 --> 02:41:09.000
I don't know we'll see anyway

02:41:09.000 --> 02:41:11.000
that does bring us to the end of another

02:41:11.000 --> 02:41:13.000
episode of Orange Lawn Radio but we want to thank you

02:41:13.000 --> 02:41:15.000
guys for being here tonight and

02:41:15.000 --> 02:41:17.000
thank you for listening to our show and

02:41:17.000 --> 02:41:19.000
as we were saying there on that call if you enjoyed

02:41:19.000 --> 02:41:21.000
the show you know

02:41:21.000 --> 02:41:23.000
well actually I said if you don't enjoy the show what to do

02:41:23.000 --> 02:41:25.000
but if you do enjoy the show please

02:41:25.000 --> 02:41:27.000
tell a friend help us spread the word because we are the

02:41:27.000 --> 02:41:29.000
show where every gamer has a voice but if the voices

02:41:29.000 --> 02:41:31.000
aren't here we can't air them

02:41:31.000 --> 02:41:33.000
auto hosts on Twitch

02:41:33.000 --> 02:41:35.000
TV for VoG network go a long

02:41:35.000 --> 02:41:37.000
way we super appreciate those

02:41:37.000 --> 02:41:39.000
if you consider adding VoG network to your auto host list

02:41:39.000 --> 02:41:41.000
a nice five star review wherever

02:41:41.000 --> 02:41:43.000
you found this show whether it be

02:41:43.000 --> 02:41:45.000
iTunes or Google podcast or wherever

02:41:45.000 --> 02:41:47.000
all of those really really go

02:41:47.000 --> 02:41:49.000
a long way and we super appreciate it

02:41:49.000 --> 02:41:51.000
I guess that's all we

02:41:51.000 --> 02:41:53.000
have to say on that end so let's go around and get everybody's

02:41:53.000 --> 02:41:55.000
final thought

02:41:55.000 --> 02:41:57.000
DarkSakura why don't we start with you your final thought tonight

02:41:59.000 --> 02:42:01.000
I don't think I

02:42:01.000 --> 02:42:03.000
have one just people need to learn that

02:42:03.000 --> 02:42:05.000
communication is very important that's all

02:42:05.000 --> 02:42:07.000
and Loki your final

02:42:07.000 --> 02:42:09.000
thought my final thought

02:42:09.000 --> 02:42:11.000
is I'm going to try to stream something

02:42:11.000 --> 02:42:13.000
this week because I've got a lot of opportunity to do that

02:42:13.000 --> 02:42:15.000
so we'll see

02:42:15.000 --> 02:42:17.000
and my final thought tonight is

02:42:17.000 --> 02:42:19.000
I don't have a lot to say

02:42:19.000 --> 02:42:21.000
I'm grateful we have

02:42:21.000 --> 02:42:23.000
new microphones there's hopefully we all

02:42:23.000 --> 02:42:25.000
sounded good tonight and that

02:42:25.000 --> 02:42:27.000
that was a worthy investment and

02:42:27.000 --> 02:42:29.000
thank you all for being here I think that

02:42:29.000 --> 02:42:31.000
last call just really summed it up perfectly

02:42:31.000 --> 02:42:33.000
it was a very feel good fuzzy way to end the

02:42:33.000 --> 02:42:35.000
show tonight thank you guys so much for being here and being

02:42:35.000 --> 02:42:37.000
part of this our little family here at Orange Lounge Radio

02:42:37.000 --> 02:42:39.000
as we come up on

02:42:39.000 --> 02:42:41.000
episode 777 which

02:42:41.000 --> 02:42:43.000
I guess is a landmark of sorts because

02:42:43.000 --> 02:42:45.000
it is that show that we joked

02:42:45.000 --> 02:42:47.000
about in the early days of O.L.R. we're not going to get

02:42:47.000 --> 02:42:49.000
to 777 episodes oops

02:42:49.000 --> 02:42:51.000
oops

02:42:53.000 --> 02:42:55.000
alright well have a great night everybody

02:42:55.000 --> 02:42:57.000

your Microsoft approved

02:43:05.000 --> 02:43:07.000
smack talking

02:43:07.000 --> 02:43:09.000
