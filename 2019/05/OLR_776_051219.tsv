7000	14000	With your hosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
14000	27000	Tonight, Pandemonium in Sacramento. I'm gonna be up front here and say that we've all been surprisingly busy and are cutting it way too close to deadlines, but the show must go on. Stay tuned for all the news that we are here to cover starting right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.
27000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	46000	Hello, my friends out there on the internet. Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight with episode number 700, 776 for this May the 12th of 2019.
46000	53000	And I'm actually half laughing and half tongue tied because everything that Jason said there in the intro tonight, accurate. Completely accurate.
53000	61000	But joining me for this mass hysteria of what's going on before the show tonight, Techmaster Loki joining me here in studio.
61000	62000	Hello.
62000	63000	Hello, how are you?
63000	64000	I'm fine.
64000	73000	Yeah. Part of the craziness tonight, not joining us tonight, DarkSakura or Jamie Summers. She had a conflict with some Mother's Day plans, things going on, so she's not gonna be able to join us tonight.
73000	81000	We wish her well, of course, and of course, to all our mothers out there celebrating all our gaming moms and mom figures and so forth, a happy Mother's Day to all of you.
81000	89000	And for those folks who aren't so into today for a variety of reasonable reasons, I see you and I hope you're doing okay today.
89000	96000	But anyway, Loki, how has your day been? Busy? Because mine's been pretty busy.
96000	116000	It wasn't that busy. I didn't do a whole lot. Just chores. I went and grabbed groceries and did laundry and took the kids to the park briefly and did some work and had to settle for a crappy subway.
116000	124000	Well, because I thought there's even more traffic because Google Maps is telling me it's gonna take 40 minutes to get here.
124000	134000	Yes. Meanwhile, by the way, there was a shootout on the freeway not far from where we record OLR and I was like texting Loki. I was like, yeah, it took me 30 minutes to get downtown earlier when it should take me like 10.
134000	140000	You might want to just be careful getting out here. And I guess that just cleared up. But yes.
141000	153000	It just cleared up. So I went to the subway that's by my work because that's on the way. And for no reason other than just to inconvenience my life, they decided to be closed.
153000	164000	Even though they're technically open because their hours stay open, they decided just I don't want to work. And so I was like, of course this would happen.
164000	174000	I never come here. But then, of course, now it happens like this. So then I went to another subway and I got my sandwich and it says subpar as I remember it.
174000	187000	You got real problems with your sandwiches. I should mention, so even the Dark Soccer, sadly not here tonight, we are going to be joined partway through the show by the ex Jason, or Jason, our voiceover guy.
187000	195000	And let me tell you what a stud Jason is because the bumper that we have tonight, he does for Twitch, we do these little, you can't do that on television parodies.
195000	204000	They don't carry over to the podcast. It's like a five second special thing for Twitch. And he does the videos for that. And he does our intros, which everybody does here on the podcast and everything.
204000	215000	He actually uploaded those from the road. He's in Truckee right now, which is up the hill. And he said he got on a Safeway Wi-Fi and uploaded those videos.
215000	223000	And then he's actually coming down the hill right now. He's going to be here at OLR Studio in probably about an hour, probably around the time the Classic Game of the Week is going.
223000	231000	He's going to pull in here and he'll be able to join us for the second half of the show. And I think it's funny because of his intro, he's like, I don't have really time to do an intro tonight.
232000	235000	And I'm like, I'm okay with it. I think it's hilarious.
235000	243000	And then me. So here's the thing. So I've been gaming today too. And this does relate to video games. Because of course we are the show where every gamer has a voice.
243000	249000	And we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Blackwell show at the Voice of Geeks Network.
249000	255000	Available at voggenetwork.com and live on Twitch every Sunday night and other nights throughout the week too with hosted programming.
255000	262000	Twitch.tv slash voggenetwork. That's V-O-G network. And that's the same place where we read our lovely live chatters.
262000	267000	But today was kind of an Ingress day. You know the mobile phone game I've been playing for a while.
267000	274000	Before there was Pokemon Go, the same company made a game called Ingress. And it doesn't have as many people, nearly as many people play in it.
274000	276000	But it's got, I guess, cult popularity, if you will.
276000	278000	I played it briefly today.
278000	283000	And they released an anime. I haven't watched it yet. There's like an anime that just came out on Netflix.
283000	286000	It's a show. It's certainly a show.
286000	288000	It is a show. That's what I've heard. It's a show.
288000	292000	But it's been a busy day for that because they did what's called Mission Day.
292000	298000	So long story short, you do these, you know, the game encourages you to go out and like explore different parts of the town.
298000	302000	So here in Sacramento we have historical places like Sutter's Fort with the Gold Rush.
302000	306000	The Delta King, the boat hotel that's like on the river and so forth.
306000	309000	So these missions kind of encourage you to go to those places and hack these portals.
309000	312000	And you get little things for your profile.
312000	317000	And, you know, you basically get a little virtual badge, like an achievement if you will.
317000	319000	Like you participated in a mission day. Good for you.
319000	320000	Yeah.
320000	322000	EPN is plus one. Yay. So there's that.
322000	328000	And then at the same time they do this thing called NL1331X or something like that.
328000	334000	It's the van. There's this Ingress van that travels around the nation and it happened to be in Sacramento today.
334000	342000	The same day as Mother's Day. The same day as the Amgen Bike Race is going on right now, which is a pretty big deal downtown.
342000	347000	The same day as, what's that fucking auction show on PBS that everybody goes crazy about?
347000	350000	Because they're at the Crocker Museum right now. Antique Roadshow, is that it?
350000	352000	So that's going on right now.
352000	355000	And so it's like everything that could possibly happen in SAC is going on right now.
355000	357000	But it just so happens this van decided to swing by.
357000	361000	And people just go to the van meetup. Why? I don't know.
361000	364000	It has something to do with the story but who cares about lore.
364000	369000	So that all was happening. So the van thing was from three to six.
369000	375000	So they just wrapped up. So I had to like drive down, check in, get my virtual badge and come right back to get set up for the show.
375000	378000	So I've been very busy myself today. But it's good.
378000	382000	It's good. I've been out, been moving, been walking, seeing some people I haven't seen in a little while.
382000	383000	So everything's been good.
383000	388000	So anyway, going to our chat over Twitch TV slash VOG Network.
389000	392000	Bobby Blackwolf says, but I thought Sacramento was a cow town.
392000	396000	Well, you know, that's what all the people in the Bay Area used to say.
396000	399000	Yet they're all moving here. I wonder what that's about.
399000	405000	There's a couple of cows here but it's actually a pretty big town all things considered.
405000	410000	It's like the number 20 market, TV market in the US. It's a pretty big city, believe it or not.
410000	414000	Anyway, speaking of TV and entertainment.
414000	416000	Sacramento's not a cow town. That's Vacaville.
416000	418000	All the cows went to Vacaville and Dixon.
418000	423000	Speaking of TV and media and things of consumption, of entertainment.
423000	427000	There's a big movie that came out this week that a lot of y'all are talking about.
427000	432000	It is a movie starring a Pokemon, but the Pokemon look very, very real.
432000	436000	It is called Detective Pikachu. And I think many of you saw it this weekend.
436000	439000	Don't worry. I'm not going to get into spoilers.
439000	442000	So if you didn't see the movie, don't worry. We're not going to ruin it for you.
442000	444000	Because I know not everybody can get out to the movies this weekend.
444000	449000	But the movie did very well. It came in number two at the box office with 58 million.
449000	453000	Which actually is still considered very good. Even though you might think, oh, but number two.
453000	457000	It did get beat by Avengers Endgame, but seeing as Avengers Endgame is about,
457000	461000	if it's not already like one of the top two movies of all time, it's about to be...
461000	463000	I think it's beat Titanic.
463000	465000	Yeah, and it might even end up being number one pretty soon.
465000	468000	So, I mean, Avengers Endgame is obviously huge right now.
468000	470000	So any movie that goes up against it is going to struggle.
470000	473000	But 58 million going against that really isn't bad.
473000	475000	It did very well for a video game movie.
475000	479000	I think it's worth saying it reviewed well for a video game movie.
479000	482000	I mean, it's not going to win an Oscar.
482000	487000	Well, when it comes to visuals and those sort of techy awards, it might. I don't know.
487000	491000	But acting and story ain't going to win an Oscar for that. Let's be real.
491000	498000	But I saw the movie, which for those that know me, I very rarely get out to movies at all.
498000	502000	But I did go see Detective Pikachu, and you did as well, right? Loki?
502000	503000	Yeah.
503000	505000	So what did you think? Spoiler-free review, what did you think?
505000	507000	I thought it was good. I liked it.
507000	508000	Yeah?
508000	511000	Yeah, I mean, I enjoyed the movie.
511000	517000	I've never played the game, so I don't know how closely it follows that storyline.
517000	518000	But I thought it was entertaining.
518000	524000	I have not played the game either, but my understanding is that it does deviate a bit from the game.
524000	527000	Like, there's ideas in the game that kind of come over.
527000	532000	If you've played and beat the game, there's some story changes that are going to be.
532000	538000	And my understanding is there's a character that's way more prevalent in the movie than they are in the game,
538000	540000	and some little changes like that.
540000	546000	But I'm not familiar with the game myself, but I sure enjoyed the movie. I did.
546000	553000	What I loved about the movie is that it didn't apologize for Pokémon being real, and they always have been real.
553000	558000	And I will say, actually, probably one of my favorite parts of the movie was the first five minutes,
558000	560000	which I don't think it's too spoilery to say.
560000	565000	Instead of just kind of jumping right into the scene where the movie takes place,
565000	571000	you have some exposition, you have some setup that's a little more like the Pokémon you might be familiar with,
571000	576000	that you actually go out into the world and catch a Pokémon and try to imprison it in the ball and that whole thing.
576000	579000	And they actually kind of do this, and you're looking at this going,
579000	585000	these are like grown-ass adults going out and trying to catch Pokémon.
585000	588000	And I'm kind of like, oh, just like Pokémon Go is.
588000	591000	Oh, this is what I look like. Oh, no.
591000	597000	But as an adult who does go out and catch Pokémon once in a while through a cell phone, I kind of live for it.
597000	602000	I loved it. And they do this little setup, and they're, I don't think this is a spoiler, I can say,
602000	607000	they're showing caveman-type pictures, trying to explain hieroglyphics, right?
607000	609000	And the Pokémon are just there in the hieroglyphics, right?
609000	612000	Again, this is all in the first five minutes, so I'm not ruining anything.
612000	617000	So I just love that. I just loved how it's like, hey, Pokémon are real.
617000	622000	Now, you don't ever see a cat or a dog in the movie.
622000	626000	Like cats and dogs, the domesticated animals we think of, just don't exist.
626000	629000	Like every bird is a Pidgey or a Spearow.
629000	634000	Every place you would expect to see a puppy, you see like a Bulbasaur or something else, you know what I mean?
634000	638000	So it does make some changes to society as we know it, but I liked it.
638000	642000	Like I was, I was just, yeah. And I thought, you know, the story wasn't bad.
642000	651000	The ending, you know, or I should say the end sequence, the last third got a little bit like, you know,
651000	655000	I mean, it wasn't bad, but it was just a little like, okay, you know, interesting.
655000	661000	But I loved how it ended. And that's obviously, I won't keep us waiting for it, but I loved how it ended.
661000	667000	I thought the ending was like, and you don't usually say that about like movies and especially games that become movies,
667000	671000	but I really liked how it ended. And that's all I'm going to say about that.
671000	675000	And chat, please respect. And don't, don't spoil nothing.
675000	680000	So, yeah, I understand they've already greenlit the sequel.
680000	686000	They greenlit the sequel before this came out. So they made the right call because this did well at the box office.
686000	692000	That's going to be interesting. Yeah. Considering, but okay.
692000	697000	I'll have to see how that, and maybe we'll get Detective Badoop after all.
697000	702000	Looking at comments over at Twitch TV slash VOG Network, Bobby Blackwell says,
702000	709000	my main comment on my show is that Danny DeVito could not have been Pikachu in the story they chose to tell in the movie.
709000	715000	It would have to be a different story. I kind of think I know where you're going with that.
715000	719000	And I get it. Yeah, no, I, I, I'm fine. I'm fine with Ryan.
719000	723000	Like perhaps Dane DeVito could be Detective Bidoof.
723000	728000	Why, why couldn't Danny DeVito be in the sequel? It's a different Pokemon. I would actually like totally live for that.
728000	734000	I think that would be great. So you never know. You never know. After all, Danny DeVito was in the Batman sequel.
734000	742000	Anyway, um, let's see. Tiger Claw on chat says, having seen Detective Pikachu, does it want you to get the actual game now that you know what happened?
742000	753000	I have to be honest. No, like I feel like I, I'm in the Pokemon universe enough with Pokemon Go and playing the mainline games and playing Let's Go Pikachu.
753000	758000	I don't really feel the need to seek out the Detective Pikachu 3DS game and go back and play it.
758000	765000	I mean, if a free copy ended up in my lap, I would probably check it out. But the reality is, you know, my 3DS.
765000	767000	Are you going to get the oversized amiibo?
767000	774000	My 3DS is kind of gathering dust at this point, so they would need to re-release it on Switch, which I don't know if they would do that or not.
774000	777000	Would I get the oversized amiibo? Sure. It was cute. I like the oversized amiibo. It was cute.
777000	784000	So, um, ActDeft in chat says no Vulpix though. Zero out of 10. Worst movie ever.
784000	790000	Yeah. You're not going to see every Pokemon, but maybe it was there just in the background somewhere. Who knows?
790000	798000	It doesn't rely on just Gen 1 Pokemon either. Like, other generations of Pokemon play a very big part in the story.
798000	801000	I think everybody kind of generally knows because you've seen the trailer.
801000	806000	Aipoms, the monkeys with the hand, the fighting monkeys with the hand, they factor into the story.
806000	809000	That's a Gen 3 Pokemon. 3 or 4. I think it's 3.
809000	814000	Snubbull factors pretty heavy in the story. That's Gen 2. And there's others as well.
814000	820000	So, um, most of the generations of Pokemon right on up through, I think, even 6 to 7 are represented.
820000	825000	So, uh, they, you know, and again, not all of them because there's like, what, 750 Pokemon.
825000	830000	So not every Pokemon is represented, but there's a good, there's a good smattering of the different generations.
830000	834000	And it's not just like all Pikachu. It's just Pikachu's the main character, obviously.
834000	841000	So, um, let's see. Also in chat, uh, Tigerlast says they need to do a Pokemon movie about Ash.
841000	847000	You know, with how well this did, it's possible. I don't know.
847000	851000	Do you think it would be interesting to go back and tell the story of the anime and Team Rocket?
851000	856000	I would like a new story that's still in the same universe that has Ash and stuff.
856000	861000	Maybe we don't have to retell the whole thing, but just have Team Rocket in there and have all, but like a brand new story.
861000	864000	You know, I kind of like, I will say one thing that I kind of like what they did.
864000	869000	Because remember when they first announced the detective Pikachu, I think a lot of us were going,
869000	873000	Why, why are you adapting the spinoff? Why aren't you just adapting?
873000	877000	If you want to make Pokemon real, adapt the main games or adapt the anime.
877000	879000	You already have, like, why are they doing detective Pikachu?
879000	885000	But I have to say, I get it. Like the way the re, because they adapted that,
885000	891000	they were able to kind of take some light liberties with the story to make it work better as a movie.
891000	898000	I think, I think they were able to bend a lot of rules that people would expect if they had just made the games or made,
898000	902000	you know, that, and I think that allowed this video game movie to work.
902000	910000	So isn't that interesting that sometimes the more successful video game movies are based on not so popular video games.
910000	914000	I mean, that hasn't always been true, but the Super Mario Brothers movie, we all know that was a flop, right?
914000	919000	But like Silent Hill, I thought was probably the best video game, not everybody agrees with that,
919000	923000	but I thought it was probably the best video game movie and that, you know, isn't as big as-
923000	926000	They have like a kind of a teaser and like within the first 30 seconds,
926000	930000	it kind of shows what that would kind of look like anyway, with like some of the battling and everything.
930000	931000	So that was pretty awesome.
931000	935000	Sure, sure. So anyway, you know, again, I'll stop talking about the movies.
935000	937000	I don't want to give anything away, but I, you know, kudos.
937000	941000	I thought the team did a good job and it's not often we can get on this show and say,
941000	944000	this was a video game movie that was, was good.
944000	947000	Like I'm not sitting here going, Oh my God, it's the best thing ever.
947000	949000	But it was, I liked it well enough.
949000	953000	And I think, I think it is up there with like Silent Hill and Mortal Kombat.
953000	955000	And in fact, I mean, here's the thing.
955000	958000	I really liked Silent Hill, probably more than most people did.
958000	963000	So like Detective Pikachu is on like that same level as Silent Hill,
963000	966000	but some of y'all I know didn't like Silent Hill.
966000	969000	So you might think that's not exactly a compliment, but I really like Silent Hill.
969000	973000	So I think it's right on up there about the same level as Silent Hill and I'll go see the sequel for sure.
973000	975000	And now I'm kind of curious, like, huh,
975000	979000	maybe this is going to get people interested in adapting video games as movies again.
979000	981000	And maybe there'll be, you know,
981000	984000	maybe now it'll be about adapting maybe some lesser known games,
984000	986000	but that have very solid stories.
986000	987000	It'll be very interesting to see what happens.
987000	990000	So until they see Sonic the Hedgehog and then they're like, Oh, right.
990000	994000	That's, that's how, that's, that's what most of them in the play Sonic,
994000	996000	the Sonic movie ruins everything.
996000	997000	I don't, I don't know.
997000	1000000	It's too early to say that I gained all this ground and then he brought it all the way back.
1000000	1004000	I don't think Sonic's going to perform on the same level as Detective Pikachu,
1004000	1009000	but I don't think it's going to flop by any, it still has Jim Carrey.
1009000	1012000	It's still a property that a lot of people know.
1012000	1015000	So parents are going to be willing to take their kids.
1015000	1017000	So I, you know, and I don't want to,
1017000	1020000	I don't want to retread the Sonic ground because we talked enough about that last week,
1020000	1021000	but I don't think Sonic's going to flop.
1021000	1023000	I think the internet's giving it a lot of crap,
1023000	1027000	but I think at the end of the day it will do well enough,
1027000	1030000	but it's not going to, it's not going to beat this Detective Pikachu,
1030000	1036000	but it's not going to flopzilla like, um, the original Mario Brothers movie or what,
1036000	1038000	what video game movies have really underperformed?
1038000	1039000	Double Dragon.
1039000	1040000	Oh, Double Dragon, yeah.
1040000	1042000	It's not going to be a Double Dragon flopzilla or anything like that.
1042000	1045000	Or the Street Fighter movie I don't think did very well for its title.
1045000	1047000	Uh, both of them.
1047000	1050000	Remember, there was a Chung Lee Street Fighter film.
1050000	1053000	Yeah, there was. I know, I know. I never saw it.
1053000	1055000	I'm probably lucky. Anyway.
1055000	1057000	So there's other Pokemon news, right?
1057000	1062000	So while we all have Pokemon Fever, this is a great time to talk about other Pokemon things going on,
1062000	1063000	not even Jet 8.
1063000	1071000	Yeah, and so there's a brief, a brief announcement that they're going to be working on a new, uh, mobile game for, um,
1071000	1078000	yeah, it's, it's basically the Pokemon company and DNA that are teaming up to make a new mobile game
1078000	1082000	that's going to release two smartphones by next year.
1082000	1087000	Um, but there's nothing other than that they're making one.
1087000	1089000	So we don't know what the hell it is.
1089000	1092000	So Pokemon games on mobile, far from a done deal.
1092000	1096000	Even though we have, you know, Pokemon Go obviously is kind of the behemoth right now.
1096000	1098000	But remember, there are other Pokemon games that exist.
1098000	1101000	There's that silly Magikarp, Magikarp jumping game.
1101000	1103000	I don't remember what it was called, Splash or something like that.
1103000	1107000	Uh, there's that, there's the match three game that was on DS they put on mobile as well.
1107000	1111000	So, you know, there are other Pokemon games on mobile, so it, you know, makes sense.
1111000	1117000	Well, isn't it interesting that here we are all these years later and Pokemon is still a big deal.
1117000	1120000	I think that in itself is kind of noteworthy, right?
1120000	1122000	Like this is a video game franchise.
1122000	1126000	These are characters that have been around a very long time.
1126000	1129000	I mean, the Pokemon games started in what, like 97, right?
1129000	1130000	In the anime and all that.
1130000	1134000	Cause I remember it was like my first year, maybe a little sooner actually, maybe a couple of years before that.
1134000	1139000	But you know, it was the mid to late nineties and Pokemon has had that kind of staying power where like,
1139000	1142000	you know, it's still a box office smash.
1142000	1148000	I don't even think it's staying power because now it's like it's getting new followers and new fans of the game
1148000	1153000	because of their other spinoff games that they've done like Pokemon Go or Pokemon Let's Go,
1153000	1155000	which is kind of a retread of the first game.
1155000	1160000	So I think you have all that to thank for it as well.
1160000	1163000	What is it about Pokemon that people just love?
1163000	1166000	Is it that the characters are just cute?
1166000	1169000	Is it just we can't get enough of how adorable Pikachu is?
1169000	1171000	And when they pika, the little ways they talk.
1171000	1176000	Like what is it about Pokemon that just people are still crazy about 20 years later?
1176000	1177000	People think they're cute.
1177000	1179000	People just think they're cute?
1179000	1181000	Yeah, people think they're cute.
1181000	1187000	Is it weird to say that when you watch the movie, you can't help but go, I want to go to this place.
1187000	1193000	I want to go to this place where all these, you know, creatures are like real and adorable and all that stuff.
1194000	1200000	One of the scenes that really sold me on how Detective Pikachu kind of nailed it and the Pokemon formula,
1200000	1204000	and I'm not ruining anything because you can actually see this scene in the trailer, right?
1204000	1206000	Everybody knows the Jigglypuffs in the movie, right?
1206000	1212000	So there's this scene when they go to like a nightclub or a seedy bar type of thing, right?
1212000	1216000	And you can see the Jigglypuff and it's not the focus of the scene.
1216000	1219000	It's just like establishing that we're at a seedy bar.
1219000	1227000	And so you see Jigglypuff singing karaoke and there's a guy just dead ass asleep on the bar right there.
1227000	1229000	And they don't acknowledge it.
1229000	1234000	They don't talk about like, oh, it's funny because Jigglypuff's voice puts people to sleep.
1234000	1238000	It's just one of those things where if you have a base familiarity with Pokemon,
1238000	1244000	that's really fucking funny that the guy's asleep on the bar right next to the Jigglypuff singing.
1244000	1247000	So I just, I don't know, I just love that.
1247000	1251000	And yeah, so anyway, looking in chat.
1251000	1252000	Oh, I'm sorry.
1252000	1254000	Act Def says it's a cafe, not a bar.
1254000	1256000	Sorry, it is a family friendly movie.
1256000	1258000	I'm sorry, it's a cafe, not a bar.
1258000	1259000	It looked like a bar to me.
1259000	1260000	Come on.
1260000	1261000	All right.
1261000	1264000	It was a coffee bar.
1264000	1269000	The Solar Bear in chat says I'm actually upset how little of Jigglypuff there was.
1269000	1271000	Hey, a lot of Pokemon got cut.
1271000	1273000	So we were blessed just to have that one scene.
1273000	1278000	Although it would have been even better if she'd drone on somebody's face with a marker and that whole thing.
1278000	1282000	I also want to acknowledge chat because you were talking about the video game movies
1282000	1285000	and how sometimes lesser known games might make for better stories.
1285000	1289000	But multiple folks in chat were bringing up Uwe Boll, right?
1289000	1291000	The curse on video game movies, right?
1291000	1298000	And Uwe Boll kind of like his MO was adapting lesser known video games and really fucking them up.
1298000	1302000	Like BloodRayne and House of the Dead was one.
1302000	1305000	They did the Dungeon Siege, right?
1305000	1306000	Alone in the Dark.
1306000	1312000	So I guess maybe Uwe Boll kind of ruined that whole thing with lesser known video games.
1312000	1313000	But I mean thank-
1313000	1314000	But it's been a long time.
1314000	1315000	It has been a while.
1315000	1317000	Uwe Boll's kind of been laughed out of the industry at this point.
1317000	1320000	I don't think he's really doing anything with movie making these days.
1320000	1322000	So I think we've had time to recover.
1322000	1323000	And obviously-
1323000	1324000	And Postal. He did Postal.
1324000	1334000	But Pikachu and Pokemon in general are a very different type of franchise than all that crap.
1334000	1338000	He was adapting a lot of more adult R-rated types of things, right?
1338000	1340000	He was basically-
1340000	1344000	What he did is like, I want to make this type of movie.
1344000	1350000	Which property can I buy that I can use to make this type of movie?
1350000	1352000	And then he would do that.
1352000	1355000	Like, some of them made no goddamn sense.
1355000	1359000	Like for example, I want to make a Western.
1359000	1364000	So which property should I purchase to make a Western?
1364000	1365000	Gun.smoke.
1365000	1368000	I know! How about Blood Rain?
1368000	1370000	Because that was the third fucking Blood Rain movie.
1370000	1372000	And it was goddamn awful.
1372000	1376000	Sia Tabiri in chat says, how can I fit Tara Reid in?
1376000	1378000	Well, I mean Tara Reid should be put in every movie.
1378000	1380000	And I got to interview him. So that was fun.
1380000	1383000	He was at a convention here in Sacramento last year or the year before.
1383000	1384000	Yeah, I know.
1384000	1389000	I had other plans. There was an Ingers fan or something.
1389000	1390000	Let's see.
1390000	1395000	The Solar Baron chat says, now that you've said his name three times, he'll be back. Thanks Rob.
1395000	1397000	Well, sorry about that.
1397000	1402000	But I think there's going to be other people in video game movies right now because of how well Detective Pikachu did.
1402000	1405000	And we already know there's a new Mario Brothers movie.
1406000	1412000	Obviously Hollywood wants you to forget they ever made a Mario Brothers movie with Dennis Hopper and Bob Hoskins.
1412000	1415000	They're never going to acknowledge that again.
1415000	1418000	So they're basically doing a new Super Mario Brothers movie that's animated.
1418000	1421000	That's the thing we know is coming. Is that next year? Or is it 2021?
1421000	1423000	But it's in the near future.
1423000	1428000	I can't remember if that's a 2020 film or 2021, but it's coming.
1428000	1430000	So it'll be interesting.
1430000	1434000	And if that does well too, that may unleash the floodgates for other Nintendo things.
1434000	1439000	I mean, we may finally get that Zelda movie. A lot of us have been waiting on for some time and so forth.
1439000	1440000	So we'll see.
1440000	1441000	Let's see.
1441000	1445000	Some folks in chat. Tigerclaw talking about the Angry Birds movie 2.
1445000	1448000	I often forget that Angry Birds is a video game thing.
1448000	1451000	Because it's a little different with the cell phone thing. It's a little more casual.
1451000	1452000	Yeah.
1452000	1454000	I mean, it certainly qualifies.
1454000	1458000	It was okay.
1458000	1461000	I've watched the movie way too many times.
1461000	1463000	Because you're kids, right?
1463000	1465000	Not of your own accord.
1465000	1468000	No, I've watched it way too many times.
1468000	1470000	And it was all right. It wasn't good.
1470000	1474000	But it wasn't as bad as, say, the Smurfs or something.
1474000	1480000	And actually, I would put that as a good barometer for where I think Sonic the Hedgehog could be.
1480000	1483000	I don't know.
1483000	1486000	The problem with Angry Birds and with a lot of things is there's no plot to it.
1486000	1492000	You're taking a game that has no story and then you're trying to inject a story into it.
1492000	1496000	And so it's like they did their best. And it was all right.
1496000	1500000	I don't know. I think...
1500000	1503000	I'd watch the sequel when it comes out on Netflix or something.
1503000	1506000	But I'm not going to go to the movie for it.
1506000	1508000	No more of that.
1508000	1509000	Probably not.
1509000	1511000	Unless the kids really want to go.
1511000	1514000	In which case, I would. But I'm probably not.
1514000	1517000	The Solar Bear points out there is story.
1517000	1521000	Piggies want eggs. Birds kill piggies to get their eggs back.
1521000	1525000	And Bobby Blackwell is reminding us of, remember, Smurfs was a box office success.
1525000	1527000	And that's true. And that's why I keep saying,
1527000	1531000	I don't think Sonic is going to flop the way all the gamers say it's going to.
1531000	1537000	I think that same market that's allowed the Smurfs and the Chipmunks and those types of movies to succeed,
1537000	1540000	I think Sonic will be okay.
1540000	1542000	I think it's going to be great. I think it's going to be bleh.
1542000	1544000	I think it's just going to be all right.
1544000	1548000	It'll get a Netflix sequel and that'll be the thing.
1548000	1550000	But we'll see. Maybe I'll be pleasantly surprised. We'll see.
1550000	1554000	I just, I don't know. I hoped better for Sonic.
1554000	1556000	You know, like, granted.
1556000	1558000	The movie's not out yet.
1558000	1559000	Just saying.
1559000	1562000	Yeah, but I mean.
1562000	1566000	They're already, like, it's already too far gone.
1566000	1568000	I mean, like, they're going to make him look okay.
1568000	1573000	Fine. But I hope they, I actually wish they'd make him look worse.
1573000	1575000	Like, make it just look goddamn terrible.
1575000	1578000	Not to get too far distant from the video games topic,
1578000	1581000	since we are a video game show, but speaking of movies and trailers
1581000	1584000	that get bad reception and things that might be too far gone,
1584000	1587000	you know, the trailers, oddly enough,
1587000	1589000	I feel like we were the one theater that didn't get the Sonic trailer
1589000	1591000	ahead of the...
1591000	1592000	No, we didn't get it either.
1592000	1593000	Oh, okay.
1593000	1596000	Or I may have missed it because I had to take my kid to the bathroom,
1596000	1598000	even though I said, go to the bathroom before we leave.
1598000	1600000	And, yeah.
1600000	1603000	But what we did see is we saw the trailer for the Lion King remake,
1603000	1604000	which looks really good.
1604000	1605000	Oh, yeah, yeah.
1605000	1607000	But, oddly, and I still can't believe these are coming out so quick to each other,
1607000	1612000	but they have both the Aladdin and the Lion King remake are out this summer.
1612000	1615000	And Aladdin, you know, a lot of people had some feelings
1615000	1619000	about how Genie's CGI looked in that movie.
1619000	1623000	So I'll be very curious to see what that translates to in receipts.
1623000	1625000	I still think that Aladdin movie's gonna do really good.
1625000	1627000	Lion King will do better.
1627000	1631000	But I feel like Disney is probably gonna regret putting Aladdin and Lion King out,
1631000	1633000	like, practically back to back.
1633000	1635000	But what do I know? I'm not a Hollywood guy.
1635000	1637000	It feels like it's a lot.
1637000	1640000	It feels like just cashing in on nostalgia, which is Disney's M.O.
1640000	1645000	But, to be fair, the audience has shown through their dollars that's what they want.
1645000	1649000	I'm just surprised they have so many movies coming out this year,
1649000	1653000	because, like, Disney, like, this year they've got, like, so much stuff coming out.
1653000	1656000	Even from just Disney proper, they have the Aladdin movie,
1656000	1659000	they have the Lion King movie, they have Frozen 2,
1659000	1662000	then Pixar, you've got, you know, Toy Story 4,
1662000	1664000	and then, of course, we're talking...
1664000	1667000	Disney owns Fox, so you've got all that, too.
1667000	1669000	It's just, it's a ton of shit.
1669000	1670000	The Solar Baron chat says,
1670000	1672000	I'm going to see Aladdin but not Lion King.
1672000	1675000	This better not, the level of disrespect against Beyoncé,
1675000	1677000	it's far too much. Far too much.
1677000	1679000	I'd be curious what your thoughts are with that.
1679000	1681000	I think some people are really put off by the talking animals.
1681000	1685000	Because it looks like, in The Lion King, it's like 100% talking animals.
1685000	1687000	And I guess that's weird to some people.
1687000	1689000	This is not cartoon.
1689000	1693000	I want a Sonic the Hedgehog movie based on the Sonic Twitter account.
1693000	1696000	You know, full of memes and just self-aware.
1696000	1698000	That's my Sonic movie right there.
1698000	1699000	Okay, alright.
1699000	1700000	Let's move on.
1700000	1702000	We could talk probably hours and hours about Hollywood,
1702000	1705000	but we want to talk about some more games.
1705000	1708000	So let's talk about the types of video games that we've been playing this week
1708000	1710000	in a segment that we call How Was Your Gaming Week?
1710000	1711000	So, Loki, how was your gaming week?
1711000	1713000	Not good, and I'll tell you why.
1713000	1716000	Because I've been working 50 to 60 hour weeks at work,
1716000	1718000	at home, doing additional work.
1718000	1720000	So, unfortunately, because of that,
1720000	1722000	I have not been playing games.
1722000	1727000	I've been just staying up till one in the morning doing work, work.
1727000	1728000	And that's not fun.
1728000	1729000	Yikes.
1729000	1734000	But I did, as is usual when I take my son to his programming class,
1734000	1736000	I work on my programming at the same time.
1736000	1738000	And so I've been working on that.
1738000	1741000	And I got my health bars done how I wanted them.
1741000	1748000	So right now they work exactly like the health bars in a Capcom arcade beat-em-up game,
1748000	1749000	with the color changes and stuff.
1749000	1751000	I haven't decided, though, if I want to change that.
1751000	1756000	Because the way they work there is if the life bar's larger than one,
1756000	1759000	it's just a certain color until it finally gets down to yellow,
1759000	1762000	then starts going away.
1762000	1765000	Whereas I may just have it keep going away
1765000	1768000	and filling back up as it goes through each of the rows.
1768000	1770000	I haven't decided if I wanted to do that.
1770000	1774000	But right now it works exactly like the Capcom arcade stuff does.
1774000	1777000	And that's all you're going to find out about it so far.
1777000	1778000	All right.
1778000	1781000	But it's taken me like six hours to get that working.
1781000	1784000	So that's it.
1784000	1788000	And I played Pokemon and very barely any Ingress.
1788000	1794000	But just a little bit of the Pokemon Go in between stuff as I'm doing things.
1794000	1796000	Yeah, that's about it.
1796000	1798000	All right. Let's see, my gaming week.
1798000	1802000	So I already talked a little bit about some of the things I've been doing this week.
1802000	1807000	But I've also been playing Final Fantasy XIV.
1807000	1810000	I've played that an awful lot, been playing that still.
1810000	1813000	And then playing more Beat Saber because it's a good way to get some exercise,
1813000	1815000	trying to clear some more songs.
1815000	1818000	I'll probably do that once I get my new Rift.
1818000	1820000	I play more on hard difficulty.
1820000	1824000	I'm trying to beat more experts, but hard is kind of like my good safe zone right now.
1824000	1826000	So those are most of the songs I'm trying to beat.
1826000	1831000	I'm trying to get that trophy for getting an S on like 10 or 15 hard songs.
1831000	1833000	There's a trophy for that, so I've been working on that.
1833000	1835000	So that's Beat Saber a little bit.
1835000	1838000	I'm back on my Heroes of the Storm bullshit suddenly.
1838000	1842000	And I say that with love because it's interesting with the Blizzard games.
1842000	1846000	I just start playing one a lot here or there.
1846000	1848000	I played a little Overwatch 2 this week.
1848000	1850000	And then as I was in the launcher for Overwatch,
1850000	1852000	I was like, oh, they put Anduin in Heroes of the Storm.
1852000	1856000	Oh, it's nice to see that Heroes of the Storm is still getting new content.
1856000	1857000	Oh, I haven't played in a while.
1857000	1858000	I should go in there and play.
1858000	1861000	Oh, now I'm doing all my quests, get my gold.
1861000	1863000	And I'm like, oh, I'm back on that bullshit.
1863000	1866000	And then in a month or two, I'll be back on my Diablo 3 bullshit.
1866000	1869000	It's just this cycle that continues with the Blizzard stuff.
1869000	1871000	It's like a different game pulls me in each month.
1871000	1875000	So the Heroes of the Storm month has started apparently for me.
1875000	1876000	So there's that as well.
1876000	1881000	You haven't tried any of the Overwatch custom game types or anything?
1881000	1883000	No, the last time I was in Overwatch,
1883000	1885000	I played just a little bit of Quick Play.
1885000	1888000	But I did a little bit of that last event before it was done.
1888000	1892000	So the Overwatch, I don't remember what they called the annual event.
1892000	1896000	It was like Uprising, but they gave it a different name every year.
1896000	1900000	So I was like, oh, crap, I got to do that because that ends in two days.
1900000	1902000	So I went in and did the story mode, got my loot box,
1902000	1905000	got my loot box just from doing some of the arcade stuff.
1905000	1907000	And I didn't get anything I liked.
1907000	1909000	I got another McCree skin.
1909000	1913000	Whenever I get legendary shit, it's McCree or Tracer.
1913000	1916000	And it's like, I don't play McCree or Tracer ever.
1916000	1917000	Why can't I have?
1917000	1919000	Well, I did get a Lucio skin once.
1920000	1925000	So I probably play Moira, Lucio, Junkrat, probably more than anybody else.
1925000	1927000	But I like Moira a lot.
1927000	1929000	I tried to play Batiste.
1929000	1932000	I couldn't get into it.
1932000	1934000	I had no idea what I was doing.
1934000	1938000	I died twice and I just switched to Moira so I could feel like I was helping.
1938000	1940000	Because I didn't know what the fuck I was doing as Batiste.
1940000	1942000	So that was too bad.
1942000	1944000	Storm Rising, yeah.
1944000	1946000	Storm Rising says Act Deaf, the Archives event.
1946000	1948000	There it is.
1948000	1952000	Metal Mayhem says just when Rob thought he was out, a different game pulls him back in.
1952000	1954000	That's how video games work.
1954000	1957000	You're done with one and another pulls you right in.
1957000	1961000	So I've also been kind of itching to do another play through of Final Fantasy XII.
1961000	1965000	Just because the last time I tried to play through on PS4, I didn't finish.
1965000	1967000	So I have that PC version.
1967000	1969000	I kind of want to play that. I don't know.
1969000	1972000	I feel like that's going to be the next thing I get sucked into.
1972000	1973000	We'll see.
1973000	1977000	But I have to admit, there haven't been a lot of new games really on my radar as of late.
1977000	1980000	There's nothing that's like, oh it just came out and I've got to play it.
1980000	1982000	So we'll see.
1982000	1989000	I'm sure as E3 comes up in the summer and especially as we get into the fall, Nintendo will finally put out that Animal Crossing.
1989000	1991000	I'll be obsessed.
1991000	1994000	Pokemon Gen 8, I'm really looking forward to.
1994000	1997000	There will still be more stuff throughout the year.
1997000	1999000	Alright, that was my gaming week.
1999000	2001000	So let's get into some news.
2001000	2003000	Some quick housekeeping though, things to note.
2004000	2007000	Next week we'll be back with episode 777.
2007000	2009000	Dark Sakura will be here as well.
2009000	2015000	And then that will be it for the month because the week after that, Memorial Day weekend, we will not be here.
2015000	2019000	Dark Sakura is going to a drag queen convention in LA, yes really.
2019000	2024000	And I'm going to Chicago for a big Ingress event and doing some other stuff out there too.
2024000	2026000	So seeing some friends and so forth.
2026000	2029000	So Memorial Day weekend is just, everybody's going places.
2029000	2031000	So we won't be here that weekend.
2031000	2037000	But we will be back the week after that when, if I'm not mistaken, we have to kind of hit the ground running on E3, right?
2037000	2040000	I think we might have one more show before all the E3 stuff starts.
2040000	2044000	But yeah, we're going to be back from Memorial Day and really hitting the ground on E3.
2044000	2045000	So it's going to be exciting.
2045000	2046000	Yes.
2046000	2048000	Alright, we hope you'll join us.
2048000	2050000	Let's get into some gaming news.
2050000	2052000	So Loki, you want to start us off tonight?
2052000	2057000	Sure, let's start off talking about what has been kind of a...
2057000	2059000	Oh wait, sorry, this is worth noting.
2059000	2060000	Sorry, because this did happen this week.
2060000	2064000	SSU 100 Matt says, Rob is also coming to New York too.
2064000	2066000	That is true.
2066000	2069000	I am finally planning my trip back to New York.
2069000	2073000	And it's going to be over Veterans Day weekend in November.
2073000	2077000	So it's a little ways off for me to start telling you there's no show that weekend.
2077000	2078000	But here's what happened.
2078000	2083000	I got tickets to see Jagged Little Pill on Broadway because they're turning that into a Broadway show.
2083000	2088000	And my pal Aria Snark, Victoria from Shaking and Crying,
2088000	2095000	it turned into, well, if we're going to go to New York and see one play, why don't we see three plays?
2095000	2102000	But it's actually, it's kind of like, she's not going to go see Jagged Little Pill and they want to go see Frozen on Broadway.
2102000	2106000	And I'm like, I don't really want to, but Victoria like dresses up and she, I mean, she looks great.
2106000	2107000	She's really into it.
2107000	2111000	So they're going to go see, when I say they, her and Melody are going to go see Frozen.
2111000	2117000	And then we're all, all of us, myself, Alan, the girls, we're all going to go see Moulin Rouge is on Broadway.
2117000	2120000	And I am fucking excited about that.
2120000	2123000	Like that's going to be that, I mean, that, that was a hell of a movie.
2123000	2125000	I can only imagine what a Broadway show that's going to be.
2125000	2126000	So, yeah, yeah.
2126000	2131000	So hopefully there will be a chance for me to say hello to listeners, meet up at Dave and Busters or something.
2131000	2133000	But yes, finally come back to New York Veterans Day weekend.
2133000	2135000	OK, I'm sorry. Now you can do the news.
2135000	2141000	All right. Anyway, so it's been definitely something that's been in process for a while.
2141000	2146000	We heard some senators complain about this a while back.
2146000	2152000	I got like a long time ago about different microtransactions and stuff like that and loot boxes.
2152000	2156000	I think actually when the whole Star Wars thing was going down, the Battlefront 2.
2156000	2172000	So now apparently one of the senators of Missouri, Senator Josh Hawley, has announced a bill to ban loot boxes and pay to win microtransactions in games played by minors.
2173000	2178000	So basically it's the Protecting Children from Abusive Games Act.
2178000	2185000	And it's kind of targeting some of these games that have like egregious loot box.
2185000	2193000	Like, for example, they're talking about Candy Crush, where it has like one hundred and fifty dollar loot box that you can buy, which is just ridiculous.
2193000	2199000	So he said when a game is designed for kids, game developers shouldn't be allowed to monetize addiction.
2199000	2210000	And when kids play the games designed for adults, they should be walled off from the compulsive microtransactions. Game developers who knowingly exploit children should face legal consequences.
2212000	2223000	So the industry has failed to police itself in this regard, unlike what happened in the 90s when it came to the violence issue and the industry came up with the ESRB as a response.
2223000	2229000	The industry has failed to respond to the loot box issue in a timely manner or with anything with significant substance.
2229000	2235000	So now the government is getting involved. And, you know, although I think there's some of us that can say, oh, I'm not surprised it's coming.
2235000	2243000	And I think there are some other people that could even be celebrating like, yay, the government is going to shut down this loot box thing and stop this predatory thing.
2243000	2251000	Like, I get that. But I worry that if you're quick to jump to that conclusion, you're missing some things here that could actually be very bad about this.
2251000	2256000	Because here's what I worry about. Tell me the name of that bill again.
2256000	2263000	It is the Think of the Children Act. Protecting Children from Abusive Games Act.
2263000	2272000	So Congress is going to invoke children on this whole thing and the games that are predatory on children. How is that going to be defined?
2272000	2278000	Who's going to define that? Who is going to decide if a game targets children or not?
2278000	2280000	The ESRB ratings.
2280000	2282000	Is it? Because ESRB is not the government.
2282000	2283000	True.
2283000	2293000	So I worry that we're starting to walk down a path very similar to, what was it, ESRB versus Schwarzenegger or ESA versus, I think it was ESA versus Schwarzenegger.
2293000	2299000	When, and what I'm referring to is that controversial law about the violent video game sales in California.
2299000	2306000	So California at one point had banned the violent video games sales. Long story short, Supreme Court struck it down.
2306000	2313000	Why did the Supreme Court strike it down? Because that line about what is a violent video game, they did not rely on the ESRB.
2313000	2316000	They were relying on this like...
2316000	2319000	But that's the problem. It was too broad. It didn't really define it.
2319000	2324000	It was broad. It didn't define it. It left too much open to interpretation.
2324000	2332000	And you know there are going to be some people that take this too far and use it as a way to kind of like shut down and lock down video games.
2332000	2337000	So I'm not too quick to celebrate what's happening here.
2337000	2345000	Did I kind of see this coming? Yes, I think we all did. Especially when the industry doubled down on this issue.
2345000	2351000	And to be quite frank, I think the ESA has failed us here.
2351000	2357000	And it's not surprising now that we're learning this week, and Bobby already talked about this at length.
2357000	2359000	I don't know how we missed it for our show tonight.
2359000	2366000	But you saw that there's like a lot of fuckery going on. Well, I should say there's an expose that's going on with the ESA.
2366000	2372000	Variety Gaming did a whole little article about it that basically sounds like the...
2372000	2379000	My interpretation of the article is that the leader of the ESA went off the deep end, apparently.
2379000	2385000	Is not running a very strong organization. Is trying to inject too much politics into this whole thing.
2385000	2394000	And is just like allowed this to go... And if y'all think you're not seeing the result of that, look at what's happened to E3, you guys.
2394000	2400000	Anyway, Bobby's talked a lot about that at length tonight. I'm not going to... I'll tell y'all to listen to his show.
2400000	2409000	But I do think there's a correlation here. I think where the ESA has kind of, for lack of a better term, started to fall up its own ass.
2409000	2412000	Sorry, not sorry. Well, what else would you call it?
2413000	2418000	Right. So the ESA has fallen up its own ass to the point where now this has been allowed to happen.
2418000	2425000	And this is what pisses me off. The ESA, instead of trying to find a solution to this problem, tried to tell us there was no problem.
2425000	2433000	And they still are, yeah. In fact, they put out a comment saying that numerous countries, including Ireland, Germany, Sweden, Denmark, Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom,
2433000	2436000	determined that loot boxes do not constitute gambling.
2437000	2445000	We look forward to sharing with the Senator the tools and information the industry already provides that keeps control of in-game spending in parents' hands.
2445000	2452000	Parents already have the ability to limit or prohibit in-game purchases with ease using parental controls.
2453000	2463000	Yeah, but I don't think, just because, I don't know. To me, that's almost like the argument of like,
2463000	2469000	well, you had this bad thing happen to you because you did this.
2469000	2476000	You could have avoided that whole situation if you didn't do something, but this happened to you because you didn't follow that.
2477000	2486000	I don't know. I like how they don't mention Belgium because Belgium did conclude that they were gambling and they've had to take them out.
2486000	2503000	And I don't know if any of these have said that these specifically are gambling or they just basically share the same types of symptoms of gambling addiction for people that are addicted to this kind of stuff.
2503000	2511000	And I think, yeah, I think a lot of this isn't exactly gambling because if it was exactly gambling, then they would be held to gambling laws.
2511000	2521000	So, of course, they're going to try to skirt that, but I think, I don't know, I think if they keep pushing it the way they're doing it, it's only going to get worse for them.
2521000	2529000	So, I'm going to our chat for some more comments here. We see S.G.O. and Hunter Matt saying an awful lot about this at twitch.tv slash vog network.
2529000	2535000	The senator is apparently very unpopular on the senate floor and because of that, it may fail when it goes to committee, so I've heard.
2535000	2540000	The sports gaming community I follow are all cheering for this. I also don't see this as a good thing, correct?
2540000	2546000	I think people are just looking at the bottom line where it's like, oh, the government's going to get rid of loot boxes. Yay!
2546000	2551000	There was a senator in Hawaii that was supposed to be putting together a bill because he was like one of the first ones that kind of was...
2551000	2556000	I believe the difference is that was a state senator. If I'm not mistaken, I could be wrong.
2556000	2562000	Y'all can fact check me on this live if you want, but I believe that was a state senator in Hawaii looking at a state law.
2562000	2568000	And now we're talking about a U.S. senator, so we're looking at a federal law. That's why this is back and it sounds like déjà vu.
2568000	2570000	That's why this is escalating more and more.
2570000	2574000	And let's be honest here, I don't think that this is a big enough problem for them to even tackle.
2574000	2582000	And if anything, the way the senate has been working nowadays, it's a corporation. They're going to protect the corporation, not the children.
2582000	2584000	Who gives a shit about the children in their opinion?
2584000	2589000	That's kind of where SJ100Matt starts to go with it as EA continues to push it hardest in their sports games.
2589000	2596000	Their ultimate team system, which is in NHL, Madden, FIFA, which is essentially a pay-to-win loot box system, brings in about $800 million a year to EA.
2596000	2601000	EA is going to lobby as much as possible to make this bill not happen, to keep this revenue.
2601000	2604000	So, how do we fix this problem, Loki?
2604000	2607000	You can't. It'll never happen.
2607000	2612000	Well, here's how it's going to happen. Stop spending $800 million on fucking microtransactions.
2612000	2615000	That'll stop them from putting them in the games.
2615000	2618000	But that's never going to happen, so you're fucked.
2618000	2622000	So the people that are irritated enough by them don't buy those games.
2622000	2627000	And the people that are happy with them, well, they're going to continue to buy those games no matter what you say.
2627000	2635000	So, you're going to have to basically show them with your wallet what you want.
2635000	2641000	Here's the problem, though. You take away one source of revenue, they're going to try to find that source of revenue somewhere else.
2641000	2646000	It's going to happen. They feel that they need to get more money from you.
2646000	2655000	That's why we have $60 games with microtransactions, with season passes, with DLC, with all this other crap that's thrown on top of it,
2655000	2662000	you know, collector's editions and all this shit, is because they can get from you, instead of $60 for a game,
2662000	2667000	they can get, like, several hundreds of dollars from you every single year.
2667000	2670000	It's just not going to change until we change.
2670000	2672000	Here's my idea on how to fix it.
2672000	2677000	I'm going to propose something that, and maybe some of y'all aren't going to think it's going to be effective,
2677000	2680000	but here's my suggestion on how we fix this whole thing.
2680000	2684000	Number one, and by far the easiest thing you can do, and I think the thing that everybody agrees,
2684000	2687000	there really isn't anything bad about this, so why not do it?
2687000	2690000	And that would be to adopt what we're seeing already happen in other countries,
2690000	2695000	where the distribution of what is in loot boxes is clear, transparent, and upfront.
2695000	2700000	Meaning you have a 10% chance of getting this, you have a 5% chance of getting this, whatever it is.
2700000	2704000	So the odds, that should always be transparent, easy to access, and upfront.
2704000	2710000	Number one, that's the thing that, if you are a game company that doesn't want to fix that,
2710000	2713000	and doesn't want to publish that, you are the fucking problem.
2713000	2715000	Like, period.
2715000	2718000	That needs to be fixed.
2718000	2722000	Number two, if EA is not going to do fuck all about this,
2722000	2726000	and the ESA, the people making the software are not going to do fuck all about this,
2726000	2729000	here's my suggestion on who can fix this.
2729000	2732000	There's three people that can fix this.
2732000	2736000	Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo are the ones that can fix this.
2736000	2738000	How are they going to fix it?
2738000	2746000	Because they're going to make it so that their hardware makes sure that they are doing the appropriate checks and balances
2746000	2752000	to ensure from a hardware perspective that children are not spending this money unnecessarily,
2752000	2754000	because it's about protecting the children, right?
2754000	2762000	So, why aren't we picking on Apple and the mobile phone gaming industry and Google in this?
2762000	2766000	Well, now that I think of it, children don't have money, so what money are they spending?
2766000	2768000	They're spending their parents' money.
2768000	2770000	So it's like your own fucking fault that you give your kids money.
2770000	2773000	Right, so let's take that a step further, right?
2773000	2777000	Because they say it's kids maybe unknowingly spending the parents' money.
2777000	2780000	So here's why I invoke Apple and Google and all that.
2780000	2785000	Because on Apple and Google, what does Apple keep selling as the new features of their phone?
2785000	2795000	Security, face recognition, thumbprint, all these things to make sure that the person spending the money on the phone is you,
2795000	2801000	and not somebody else in your family, a kid, or heaven forbid, your phone gets stolen, abandoned, abandoned, somebody else, right?
2801000	2802000	Abandoned it.
2802000	2804000	Do you see where I'm going with this?
2804000	2808000	This is what Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo need to do.
2808000	2813000	Because if they don't fix the problem, it's going to affect them, because they get a cut of all these sales, right?
2813000	2823000	They need to embed it within their own OSs to ensure that people that are spending the money are the person who is on the card.
2823000	2826000	Now, I would say it's not so much children spending that is a problem.
2826000	2832000	It's more people with addictive tendencies that are adults that have the problem.
2832000	2838000	You know, and if they really wanted to impress the government and really take steps around that,
2838000	2842000	they might make a note when you've spent so much money.
2842000	2849000	A little display will come on the screen that says, you know, if you need help with a gambling addiction, call this number.
2849000	2852000	They do that in Vegas. Look at those billboards on the lottery.
2852000	2855000	What about this? What about like parental controls?
2855000	2861000	What if we had an option, like a setting in the hardware where I can turn off microtransactions?
2861000	2866000	So if I know I have a problem with spending money on that kind of crap,
2866000	2871000	and I want to take, you know, preventative actions to avoid putting myself in that scenario,
2871000	2877000	that I can toggle those off, and just like, you know, we don't want children getting access to them,
2877000	2880000	it will shut off access to them so I don't see any references to it.
2880000	2883000	I don't see anything that's tied to those microtransactions.
2883000	2885000	I need to respond to this in chat.
2885000	2892000	So Bobby in chat says, all things Samsung phones had years ago, by the way, Android for the win, Apple invented security.
2892000	2894000	Respectfully, you're starting the wrong fight here.
2894000	2900000	And the reason why is because the reason why I'm invoking Apple is because we know Apple puts on a show.
2900000	2903000	Sure, Google, they all do these keynotes as well.
2903000	2904000	But let's be real.
2904000	2912000	Apple keynotes get covered by the media, and all that stuff gets super noticed in the mainstream and so forth.
2912000	2917000	So that's kind of why I say that when Apple talks about security and all this stuff,
2917000	2925000	there are generally people that are listening to the latest upgrades and so forth in security and how mobile phones and so forth.
2925000	2932000	I fully realize Apple didn't invent all of this, and sometimes they're just running with a trend that they see in the industry.
2932000	2933000	That's part of competition.
2933000	2936000	But regardless, let's get back on what the real point is about it.
2936000	2944000	I think that Nintendo, Microsoft, and Sony need to kind of look at what can they do to show that within their own systems,
2944000	2950000	they are trying to protect money from not being spent unless it's the intended purchaser,
2950000	2952000	basically making it harder for kids to spend money.
2952000	2956000	And I know that might sound like it's shooting themselves in the foot because they kind of like it,
2956000	2959000	because they make more money when kids are spending money and so forth.
2959000	2964000	But they've got to realize, if this passes, this is going to be a whole lot worse for them.
2964000	2965000	So what can they do?
2965000	2969000	How about turning on parental controls by default?
2969000	2973000	You have to set a passcode in order to be able to use your card.
2973000	2978000	I think to some extent, honestly, they're kind of already doing this.
2978000	2983000	I think they just need to maybe take it a step further to really show how,
2983000	2988000	and maybe this is where I've got to invoke Apple and that showmanship, if you will.
2988000	2992000	They've got to go out there and show how with these new systems that are coming out,
2992000	3000000	this security is enabled by default and that they're making it so that only the person that is making the purchases
3000000	3003000	is able to use the card.
3003000	3006000	Because I think if they can do that, then the industry can say,
3006000	3012000	that's how we're protecting kids because we've put in these security initiatives by default
3012000	3017000	to ensure that a card purchaser or a card holder is the only one that's able to actually spend money on the account.
3017000	3022000	And again, I want to stress, I do realize that Sony, you have to kind of put in a password.
3022000	3024000	I don't know if that's always on by default.
3024000	3027000	And a lot of times they kind of encourage you to save password and things like that, too.
3027000	3030000	So I do think they need to communicate just a little more clearly.
3030000	3032000	Well, they do a lot of two-factor all the time.
3032000	3034000	Yeah, and two-factor is fine, too.
3034000	3037000	And it's kind of to an annoying extent, but I understand why I have it.
3037000	3039000	And that's my suggestion.
3039000	3043000	And that's how loot boxes, I suppose, could stay in the industry.
3043000	3046000	So again, number one, make the odds transparent.
3046000	3054000	Number two, the systems need to up and the consoles need to enable on there by default
3054000	3062000	that only the card holder is the one that can push the button and initiate the transaction to buy the loot box or whatever it is.
3062000	3068000	And I think if they can show that, then that will be how they can say that kids can't spend money
3068000	3071000	unless their parents told them the password, which you shouldn't do.
3072000	3075000	So that's my thought.
3075000	3078000	Do you think there might be anything to that? I don't know.
3078000	3079000	I don't think they're going to do anything.
3079000	3083000	I hope they do because I think if this passes, it's going to be a whole lot worse.
3083000	3089000	But maybe they're just banking on, ah, it's not going to pass because just like the ESA versus Schwarzenegger thing
3089000	3093000	and the violent thing being too vague, this protecting children thing is too vague.
3093000	3098000	So we're just going to run out the clock because that's a popular trend in politics these days.
3098000	3103000	We're just going to wait it out because we know politics is a slow process, so we're just going to run out the clock.
3103000	3104000	Yep.
3104000	3107000	I just think that's dangerous.
3107000	3111000	Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, but Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo want their cut of the loot box prices.
3111000	3113000	Remember, EA doesn't get 100%.
3113000	3117000	Oh no, I full well recognize this, but I think those three companies have to ask a hard question.
3117000	3119000	What's worse?
3119000	3122000	What's going to impact the bottom line more?
3122000	3125000	The security features I'm talking about or this bill?
3125000	3129000	Because this bill is going to come if they continue to do nothing.
3129000	3133000	It might take seven years, but it's going to come eventually.
3133000	3137000	So anyway, I've talked a lot about that. Let's move on, shall we?
3137000	3138000	Yes.
3138000	3139000	Let's go to another story.
3139000	3142000	So let's talk about another big thing that's going on in the industry this week.
3142000	3146000	There was a big walkout that happened this week, and the walkout happened at Riot Games.
3146000	3151000	And 150 employees this week walked out at Riot Games in their offices in Los Angeles.
3152000	3157000	They were basically having a protest over recent discrimination lawsuits that were happening at Riot Games.
3157000	3160000	Riot, of course, most well known for the game League of Legends.
3160000	3164000	Funny that I was talking about Heroes of the Storm, because League of Legends is a game that's kind of like that.
3164000	3169000	But it's the game that Riot puts out in response, or I guess really was first if you want to.
3169000	3172000	But Dota was really the first. Anyway, forget it.
3172000	3178000	So there was a big expose that Kotaku had done, gosh, when was it?
3178000	3185000	It was last year, it was over the summer last year, about some sexism and some other things allegedly going on in the workplace.
3185000	3193000	And some employees filed suit, and the publisher basically, Riot, wanted to force these to go to forced arbitration,
3193000	3201000	because this is very popular in corporate culture, is to back out of the courts and make people go to arbitration.
3201000	3205000	Arbitration clauses, right? You've probably heard of them, you see them all the time.
3205000	3210000	So, in this employment world, it's no different in that regard.
3210000	3213000	And these employees were signing up to work at this company.
3213000	3217000	They probably had to sign some type of arbitration clause that is basically,
3217000	3221000	any dispute won't be settled in court, it'll be settled in arbitration.
3221000	3228000	Why do we always go to arbitration? Because usually arbitration tends to side a little more on the corporate side of things,
3228000	3234000	because it is a private process as opposed to a public process, which would be the judicial system, right?
3234000	3238000	So, that's why arbitration tends to do these things.
3238000	3244000	But I think it's pretty notable that you have a bunch of employees that stood up, walked out, and said, fuck that, basically.
3244000	3250000	Because I think why this is noteworthy, it's not just about dogging on Riot Games and the continued issues,
3250000	3255000	but this ties into, I think, some of these bigger things we've been talking about in the industry and what's been going on for a while,
3255000	3259000	between the crunch time and other things that are a problem in the industry.
3259000	3267000	This is the first sign you've had of people coming together and banding up for a common purpose,
3267000	3272000	and taking, it's very similar to what might happen if the industry were to unionize.
3272000	3278000	So, in some ways, this was a big step, maybe, in that direction.
3278000	3285000	I know I'm using a lot of vague language there, but I know the word union also scares some people, so we don't know.
3285000	3293000	But regardless, we're seeing a lot of workers in the gaming industry kind of band together and stick up for themselves.
3293000	3296000	So, it could be very interesting to see where this goes from here.
3296000	3301000	What did you think watching this whole thing? I'm curious, at the chat as well, what did you guys think?
3301000	3311000	Well, I had watched some videos that were covering the story, and they were talking about how just the corporate,
3311000	3324000	just the way that they kind of interact, the words, just the way the normal interactions was very misogynistic, I guess,
3324000	3329000	from what I hear, that there's a lot of sexist comments coming from some of the execs.
3329000	3337000	That's kind of what prompted some of these lawsuits, but because there's arbitration stuff that they had,
3337000	3346000	they were being forced to, they felt like they couldn't be heard by anyone in power to actually take action on that stuff.
3346000	3350000	That's a very good point, because when it's arbitrated, it's all behind closed doors.
3350000	3356000	When it's judicial, it's a matter of public record. That's a very good clarification between the two processes.
3356000	3359000	And on that note, I do want to read, because Bobby's doing a little...
3359000	3361000	Corporate culture. That's what I wanted. Culture.
3361000	3364000	Bobby's doing a little fact-checking in real time in chat, and this is fine.
3364000	3367000	I don't mind being told. It's a little different. Bobby says,
3367000	3375000	The walkout is because Riot is not forcing new employees into arbitration, but they're keeping all existing employees on the forced arbitration clause.
3375000	3380000	So, new employees can go to court. Existing employees can only go to arbitration.
3380000	3387000	Well, certainly, there's a disconnect there. Maybe Riot was trying to clean things up a little bit after the Kotaku thing came out,
3387000	3390000	so they kind of changed some of their rules.
3390000	3394000	But I think it makes sense that if you do something that favors new employees,
3394000	3400000	then the employees that were already there should be included on that plan, right?
3400000	3404000	Like, if you're going to give new employees more PTO, usually you bump everybody else up.
3404000	3409000	Aren't they just worried that if they did drop that clause, that all of a sudden, they're going to get lots of lawsuits?
3409000	3410000	Is that the word?
3410000	3416000	I don't know. I don't know if we fully know the answer to that, but there's certainly a reason for it.
3416000	3423000	Anyway, now, Riot Games is saying, you know, they tried to kind of play this whole thing cool.
3423000	3426000	You kind of wonder if there's sweat and bullets behind the scene or what's going on.
3426000	3430000	But Riot did say, they put out a statement, they said, and they commented to Variety,
3430000	3433000	they said, We support Rioters making their voices heard today.
3433000	3439000	We've asked all managers to make every commendation to allow Rioters to participate, including freeing up meeting times.
3439000	3444000	We respect Rioters who choose to walk out today and will not tolerate retaliation of any kind
3444000	3449000	as a result of participating. So, I mean, they've been dragged through the mud publicly once already.
3449000	3455000	They're going out of their way to be like, Oh, yeah, it's cool. You're going to walk off your jobs.
3455000	3459000	It's cool. It's cool. Yeah, you know, maybe we deserved it a little bit. I don't know.
3459000	3467000	So, they're very much trying to at least outwardly give that impression of, Oh, you know, we're cool.
3467000	3471000	We don't, you know, please don't write another mean thing about us and keep playing League of Legends, right?
3471000	3472000	Yeah.
3472000	3476000	I mean, time will tell if this is to have impact.
3476000	3482000	But certainly, the employees that walked out have kind of threatened that they're going to do more if things don't change.
3482000	3487000	So, if this arbitration clause doesn't go away in favor of the judicial process and so forth,
3487000	3493000	of course, they're not saying what it is because maybe they don't want Riot to be able to prepare a statement next time.
3493000	3495000	And that could be a variety of things.
3495000	3498000	You could talk about, you know, and again, I'm making shit up.
3498000	3501000	I don't know anything about what's going on behind closed doors at Riot.
3501000	3503000	I'm completely making shit up.
3503000	3507000	They could walk out again but not warn people when it's going to happen.
3507000	3509000	And they could time this around an important deadline.
3509000	3511000	They could do something timed with E3.
3511000	3515000	There could be a convenient breaking of some major NDAs.
3515000	3517000	We don't know.
3517000	3520000	There could be a leak.
3520000	3525000	Around my E3? I don't believe that.
3525000	3531000	I mean, again, I'm just making shit up but these are the types of things that could happen potentially.
3531000	3535000	So, if you wanted to damage a company, that might be a way to do it.
3535000	3536000	Spill all their secrets.
3536000	3538000	Leak all their secrets.
3538000	3545000	And make it so that, you know, I'm sure there are lots of gaming websites out there that would promise anonymity for some of those secrets.
3545000	3548000	Of course, then they might get taken to court but you got the First Amendment.
3548000	3549000	It would get ugly.
3549000	3561000	Anyway, I'm not saying they should do that but it's going to be interesting to see how this might escalate if Riot doesn't, you know, listen to some of these demands.
3561000	3563000	And it may not end there.
3563000	3574000	If this campaign is successful, perhaps we're going to see employees start to stand up for things like crunch time and for things like benefits and so on and so forth.
3574000	3579000	So, we're at a very interesting sort of turning point, I think, in the industry.
3579000	3581000	It could be very, very interesting.
3581000	3591000	So, SSTO100Matt says the industry needs to unionize and don't believe the nonsense about saving enough money on union dues to buy a game console like what Delta did this week.
3591000	3593000	Oh yeah, that was a whole thing. Did you see that?
3593000	3594000	No.
3594000	3601000	Delta was putting out these ads. They're all over Twitter about the $700 you spend annually in union fees could go to buy a new game console and all these games.
3601000	3609000	There's a variety of different little ads that show what $700 could buy you and just the game console one is the one that's catching a lot of gamer's attention, obviously.
3609000	3611000	So, yeah, interesting.
3611000	3617000	SSTO100Matt also says happy employees respect their companies.
3617000	3618000	Just saying.
3618000	3620000	And isn't that the truth?
3620000	3623000	I think we'll end it on that note and we'll move on to our next story.
3623000	3625000	So, let's go to something a little more positive.
3625000	3626000	Yeah, Loki?
3626000	3627000	Yes.
3627000	3628000	So, this is pretty cool.
3629000	3631000	Did you know that Minecraft is 10 years old?
3631000	3633000	So, that's right. They're celebrating.
3633000	3645000	Don't you feel old as a result because that's why every time I see one of those things on Facebook that says XYZ is 20 years old today or, you know, God, what was the thing that was just recently going around is like 30 years old as of today.
3645000	3648000	I don't know, but it's just like, wow, I feel old.
3648000	3651000	Yeah, I'm trying to remember.
3651000	3652000	But anyways, yeah.
3652000	3654000	So, it is 10 years old.
3654000	3661000	And to celebrate, they have a brand new map that you can play that's basically celebrating the whole history of Minecraft.
3661000	3668000	They even have this large Minecraft minecart ride that kind of walks you through all the different things.
3668000	3673000	They have like this giant compendium of all the blocks and how to use them and all the mobs.
3673000	3679000	And aside from it being quite impressive to look at, there's also some Easter eggs in there and you can go check that out.
3679000	3685000	Basically, any version of Minecraft that's available out there, I think you can actually play this on right now.
3685000	3689000	So, that's still currently being updated, of course.
3689000	3691000	I don't think 360 is going to be able to do that.
3691000	3693000	Some interesting comments from chat.
3693000	3697000	S2100Matt says, Minecraft is now eligible for Classic Game of the Week.
3697000	3699000	Fuck. I guess it is.
3699000	3700000	I guess it is, yeah.
3700000	3701000	Stay tuned.
3701000	3707000	I don't know if it'll come up on Jamie's radar, but we have had guests picking games lately and I don't believe Minecraft is on the ban list.
3708000	3710000	Why would it be on the ban list?
3710000	3711000	I don't think it is.
3711000	3716000	BobbyBlackWolf wonders in their 10th anniversary post, do they mention Notch?
3716000	3719000	Because I don't know if you know, but he's kind of messy.
3719000	3726000	I don't know, but part of the map is all of the little phrases that were in Minecraft.
3726000	3731000	Like when you start it up, how there's little catch tag lines or whatever that are on there.
3731000	3733000	So, they have the whole map surrounded by those.
3733000	3737000	So, I don't know if it mentions Notch in any of those.
3737000	3738000	I would guess no.
3738000	3743000	I'm going to guess that a company kind of knows when something is much bigger than one person.
3743000	3746000	And I think Minecraft is far past that point.
3746000	3750000	Where, you know, don't cry for that guy.
3750000	3751000	Because how much money did he get?
3751000	3752000	Yeah.
3752000	3753000	Yeah.
3753000	3755000	So, we're not going to shed any tears for that.
3755000	3758000	So, yeah, right now it's free to anyone that has the Bedrock versions of the game.
3758000	3764000	So, that includes Xbox One, Switch, PC, and mobile devices.
3764000	3768000	No PlayStation 4 apparently.
3768000	3770000	And then, what else?
3770000	3777000	And then, they also have it available for the Java versions in Realms.
3777000	3783000	I know I saw on the, because this actually, this map was created by somebody that does a lot of map creation.
3783000	3788000	And so, they had it tagged where you can download the maps to play it in the Java version.
3788000	3790000	So, but it's out there.
3790000	3791000	I'm sure if you go to the Minecraft site.
3791000	3795000	On top of that though, they have this now classic version of Minecraft.
3795000	3798000	So, the very first version of Minecraft is out there.
3798000	3801000	Like, prior to a lot of the features that you come to love in there.
3801000	3803000	Like, for example, there's no mobs.
3803000	3805000	You only have eight types of blocks.
3805000	3807000	It's only in creative mode.
3807000	3809000	So, they have that.
3809000	3814000	So, apparently, you can play that in your browser now.
3814000	3824000	So, you can actually go check it out at minecraft.net slash en dash us article.
3824000	3828000	And then, embrace dash past dash minecraft dash past.
3828000	3829000	I can't write that fast.
3829000	3831000	Just go to minecraft.net.
3831000	3832000	I'm sure they've got a link.
3832000	3833000	I think that'll work.
3833000	3834000	Yes.
3834000	3835000	Or Google it.
3835000	3836000	Yes, or Google it.
3836000	3839000	You can check it out and play it.
3839000	3843000	I see more than eight blocks there.
3843000	3844000	I don't know about that.
3844000	3846000	But, it's neat.
3846000	3849000	Okay, but 4K Super Graphics Pack win.
3849000	3852000	Sonic Ether was working on it.
3852000	3853000	Sort of.
3853000	3859000	But, unfortunately, he stopped sharing stuff like the beta versions.
3859000	3861000	They quietly stopped talking about that.
3861000	3862000	Yeah, maybe.
3862000	3863000	Maybe E3.
3863000	3865000	Well, just like the last time they talked about it.
3865000	3870000	Well, actually, didn't they announce something coming up on the 17th?
3870000	3871000	Was it?
3871000	3874000	Didn't they announce like they put something out like a teaser with a date on it?
3874000	3878000	Because I thought I saw something in our Discord over at vognetwork.com slash Discord about it.
3878000	3879000	Like, they were teasing a date.
3879000	3881000	Somebody had posted about that.
3881000	3885000	So, I don't know if maybe there are more announcements to come or what have you.
3885000	3888000	Is that when their next like inside Xbox is going to be?
3888000	3889000	I don't think it's inside Xbox.
3889000	3891000	I think it's a Minecraft focus thing.
3891000	3892000	Inside Minecraft?
3893000	3895000	No, I think it's just a Minecraft.
3895000	3897000	Because don't they do like Minecon and that kind of stuff?
3897000	3900000	Minecon was already happened.
3900000	3902000	That was in April.
3902000	3904000	But, yeah.
3904000	3906000	I mean, I haven't played Minecraft in a while.
3906000	3909000	I know they have new mobs and everything since I played Minecraft.
3909000	3912000	So, we need to go back and play again.
3912000	3914000	I know. I know you miss Minecraft.
3914000	3916000	Actually, I wanted to go dig it up.
3916000	3918000	So, that's why I'm looking at my phone right now.
3918000	3923000	I'm actually going onto the Discord to find what that was that was being shared.
3923000	3924000	And, yeah.
3924000	3928000	Okay. So, it was posted by 13X Forever in our Discord on Monday saying,
3928000	3933000	Minecraft AR teased at the end of today's Microsoft Build Conference keynote.
3933000	3935000	So, May 17th.
3935000	3938000	And they show like a little like they're holding the phone.
3938000	3940000	So, there may be more information.
3940000	3941000	I guess that wouldn't be the full day.
3941000	3942000	I wonder if they're going to.
3943000	3949000	I mean, maybe they're pushing that to the Windows reality.
3949000	3951000	Do those have the passthrough cameras on it?
3951000	3953000	I know like some of them have the passthrough cameras on them.
3953000	3955000	I don't know if the mixed reality headsets.
3955000	3959000	I would assume mixed reality means that maybe they do.
3959000	3961000	It would be neat if it was coming like phones.
3961000	3963000	Like you do AR like building with that.
3963000	3966000	Yeah, Minecraft Go says Act Deft with a question mark.
3966000	3970000	So, like a Minecraft type of real world type game.
3970000	3971000	That could be very interesting.
3971000	3972000	We'll see.
3972000	3974000	I guess we'll find out this coming week.
3974000	3975000	It's possible.
3975000	3976000	I'd play it.
3976000	3977000	Yeah. We'll see.
3977000	3979000	All right. Anyhow, moving on.
3979000	3981000	Another game that I know a lot of people are very excited about.
3981000	3982000	Tetris 99.
3982000	3983000	That's still a thing.
3983000	3988000	And I think many people kind of foresaw when Tetris 99 first came out.
3988000	3989000	People kind of foresaw.
3989000	3992000	You know, excuse me.
3992000	3996000	You know, there seems to be room in this for there to be more than just the Battle Royale.
3996000	3997000	That there's room.
3997000	4000000	And sure enough, it's been announced there is more coming.
4000000	4002000	It's the Big Block DLC.
4002000	4007000	And it will be offline modes for Tetris 99 for $9.99.
4007000	4008000	So, here's the thing.
4008000	4012000	Tetris 99 right now is free if you have the Switch Online, right?
4012000	4013000	So, it's kind of like a free game.
4013000	4017000	But, I mean, it would only work online anyway if you had the Nintendo Switch Online.
4017000	4020000	So, now they're going to be selling a version of it, basically.
4020000	4024000	Or this DLC, if you will, for $10 that will allow you to do offline.
4024000	4027000	So, it will include CPU battle.
4027000	4030000	You versus 98 computer players.
4030000	4035000	Which would be good if you want to play on the go on an airplane or somewhere where you don't have internet.
4035000	4038000	Or if you just don't like playing with people online.
4038000	4040000	Although, you don't really interact with people online.
4040000	4042000	They feel like computer players.
4042000	4043000	You don't really interact with them.
4043000	4044000	But, whatever.
4044000	4048000	I mean, you can play this game when you're not buying internet.
4048000	4049000	That's, you know, something that would happen.
4049000	4051000	Also, though, there's more.
4051000	4055000	Marathon, which would involve clearing the most lines and scoring big.
4055000	4058000	And you don't need an internet connection for either one.
4058000	4059000	So, yeah.
4059000	4064000	And then I think they were talking about some type of upcoming mode or tournament or something where...
4064000	4065000	Yeah, here it is.
4065000	4071000	The maximum cup event from May 17th at midnight to May 19th at 11.59 PM.
4071000	4076000	If you get 100 points, you get a special Game Boy theme that looks like the old Game Boy Tetris game.
4076000	4077000	Which is kind of cute.
4077000	4081000	So, I wish you could just get that for playing.
4081000	4083000	I wish you didn't have to score a ton of points to do it.
4083000	4084000	But maybe that won't be too hard.
4084000	4085000	I don't know.
4085000	4086000	I want to check out that Game Boy theme, though.
4086000	4087000	That looks pretty cool.
4087000	4090000	So, I know a lot of you are enjoying Tetris 99.
4090000	4093000	And you got some more stuff to look forward to there.
4093000	4095000	So, Bobby Blackwolf points out,
4095000	4097000	Computer players aren't as good as human players.
4097000	4099000	I can actually win in single player.
4099000	4101000	ActDef says,
4101000	4104000	People are hating on the big block DLC and I really don't understand why.
4104000	4106000	Probably the $10 charge.
4106000	4107000	People are probably like,
4107000	4108000	But the game was free.
4108000	4109000	Why am I paying to...
4109000	4110000	Probably, I think that's...
4110000	4111000	You don't have to.
4111000	4112000	It's optional.
4112000	4113000	It is optional.
4113000	4114000	You don't have to pay it.
4114000	4115000	So,
4115000	4116000	Dr. Studio says,
4116000	4117000	I did eventually get to 100.
4117000	4119000	So, I don't think the Game Boy skin will be that hard to unlock.
4119000	4120000	Well, that's good to know.
4120000	4121000	That'll be good.
4121000	4122000	Anyhow, let's move on.
4122000	4125000	Just a couple more stories for you guys before we get to the Classic Game of the Week.
4125000	4126000	Loki.
4126000	4128000	So, they've announced the E3 press conference schedule.
4128000	4131000	So, we can take a look and see what we're going to be up against.
4132000	4134000	Starting June 9th.
4134000	4136000	So, June 9th, of course, being a Sunday.
4136000	4139000	We've got Microsoft at 1 p.m. Pacific time.
4139000	4144000	And followed by Bethesda at Sunday at 9...
4144000	4146000	5.30.
4146000	4150000	Then the following day on that Monday, June 10th.
4150000	4152000	We've got Ubisoft at 1.
4152000	4158000	And later on the evening, Square Enix at 6 p.m. Pacific time.
4158000	4162000	Followed by Nintendo doing their direct at...
4162000	4165000	On June 11th, 9 a.m. Pacific time.
4165000	4167000	So, I'm looking at the calendar here.
4167000	4168000	That's why I'm looking at my phone.
4168000	4169000	I'm looking at a calendar.
4169000	4171000	And so, next week is episode 777.
4171000	4173000	We're off on May 26th.
4173000	4174000	Okay, that's the week we're off.
4174000	4176000	We come back June 2nd.
4176000	4177000	So, that's kind of the ramp into E3.
4177000	4179000	It's kind of the last show before E3.
4179000	4180000	And when the rumors are really going to start to...
4180000	4183000	And you might start to hear some indie news and so forth.
4183000	4185000	And then June 9th is right after that.
4185000	4187000	So, 779 will be the E3 show.
4187000	4191000	Because Bethesda is going to interrupt our show again.
4191000	4193000	With whatever they've got going.
4193000	4195000	Which we kind of don't know.
4195000	4199000	Because that star field probably isn't ready, right?
4199000	4200000	So, we don't...
4200000	4203000	That's never stopped them from releasing something.
4203000	4204000	Fair.
4204000	4206000	Be very curious to see what they're going to talk about.
4206000	4208000	And then since Sony isn't doing anything Monday night...
4208000	4213000	Oh, I think it's about time for like a Fallout New Vegas remaster or something like that.
4213000	4214000	Wait a minute.
4214000	4216000	So, Square Enix is doing their own thing Monday night, right?
4216000	4217000	Instead of Sony, right?
4217000	4218000	Yes.
4218000	4220000	So, we're very likely to see some things on the Final Fantasy VII remake.
4220000	4222000	Which I'm about to touch on here as well.
4222000	4226000	Do you think maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe?
4226000	4228000	We're going to see Final Fantasy XVI.
4228000	4230000	It's time. It's time. It's time.
4230000	4232000	Final Fantasy XVI. It's time. It's time.
4232000	4234000	We've moved on from XV, right?
4234000	4236000	We're done.
4236000	4238000	Final Fantasy XVI. It's time, yeah?
4238000	4239000	It's time.
4239000	4241000	For Urgance 2.
4241000	4242000	No?
4242000	4243000	Alright.
4243000	4244000	Well, I guess that does go...
4244000	4246000	Come on. Think of the esports.
4246000	4248000	Urgance 2. Come on.
4248000	4254000	I guess that does go right into another story here about Final Fantasy VII and the Final Fantasy VII remake.
4254000	4259000	And sure enough, this week, Sony PlayStation did a State of Play update.
4259000	4262000	Which is PlayStation Direct, essentially, under a different name.
4262000	4264000	And they showed a few things there.
4264000	4266000	Some of the stuff is sprinkled throughout our show a little later.
4266000	4271000	But also, the fact that we got an update on the Final Fantasy VII remake.
4271000	4273000	We got a little bit more of a trailer.
4273000	4276000	Which showed some gameplay and it showed some cinematics.
4276000	4280000	Probably, you know, some scenes we got to kind of see in the remake style.
4280000	4285000	Such as that first scene where Aerith runs into Cloud and offers him the flower.
4285000	4287000	Which was, you know, that's seen in the original game.
4287000	4290000	And you see that a little more fully realized.
4290000	4294000	And they did tease that there would be more coming in June.
4294000	4299000	Well, now we know they have their own press conference coming up instead of Sony.
4299000	4303000	It would seem very likely that that would be the time that we're going to get more information.
4303000	4304000	Gameplay!
4304000	4307000	Well, I mean, the trailer has gameplay in it.
4307000	4308000	Like actual gameplay.
4308000	4311000	Maybe, yeah. Now, maybe instead of it being so sliced up.
4311000	4313000	Gameplay demo, huh?
4313000	4315000	Maybe. Maybe we'll see something like that.
4315000	4316000	Maybe.
4316000	4317000	That could very well be a thing.
4317000	4321000	It should be noted, though, on the same token there with Final Fantasy VII.
4321000	4324000	They are still planning to make the remake episodic.
4324000	4326000	And you may have noticed, even in that trailer.
4326000	4330000	It seemed like everything in that trailer was the first hour of the game, if that.
4330000	4331000	I mean, there wasn't.
4331000	4332000	That's probably all they have done.
4332000	4334000	I don't know. I would hope they have more.
4334000	4336000	Maybe they're just holding some of that back for E3.
4336000	4339000	We don't know where the episode lines are being drawn.
4339000	4342000	But we do know that Final Fantasy VII still plans to be episodic.
4342000	4344000	It's each of the discs. Why not?
4344000	4347000	Well, but disc three was nothing but the last dungeon in the ending.
4347000	4348000	I don't think...
4348000	4349000	That's it, yeah.
4349000	4350000	I don't think they're going to draw the lines.
4350000	4351000	Haha, Sucker, you bought it for 60 bucks.
4351000	4353000	I don't think they're going to draw the lines what they did on the disc.
4353000	4357000	I think it's very logical that the whole sequence with getting out of Midgar.
4357000	4358000	That'll be episode one.
4358000	4360000	Maybe it goes into Advent Children.
4360000	4364000	I don't know. I think y'all are just adding your own shit to it.
4364000	4368000	I think where Midgar is, that'll be the end of the first episode.
4368000	4371000	And then kind of in the overworld up to a certain...
4371000	4372000	I'm trying to remember back in the game.
4372000	4375000	But they'll probably split the overworld into like two and three.
4375000	4377000	I would imagine there's three episodes, but who knows?
4377000	4378000	There might be more.
4378000	4379000	But here's something.
4379000	4382000	I mean, since they are splitting it up into episodic content,
4382000	4384000	you can expect you're going to pay 60 bucks for each episode.
4384000	4388000	So for the full Final Fantasy VII remake experience,
4388000	4390000	get ready to pay $180.
4390000	4391000	I would say at least.
4391000	4392000	Or just wait.
4392000	4393000	I would guess.
4394000	4398000	Now, this also begs an interesting question here, if you ask me.
4398000	4403000	We're already talking about the PlayStation 5 in 2020.
4403000	4407000	And we've already talked about how some games may just kind of come out
4407000	4411000	for PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5, right?
4411000	4415000	Isn't that going to be interesting if they get the Final Fantasy VII remake
4415000	4418000	Episode 1 out for PlayStation 4?
4418000	4424000	Then they put it out again on PlayStation 5 just before Episode 2 comes out.
4424000	4427000	That's how they're going to get $60 from you twice for the same episode.
4427000	4429000	Watch. Watch.
4429000	4433000	Of course, we also know the PlayStation 5 will play PlayStation 4 games,
4433000	4435000	so you won't necessarily have to do that.
4435000	4438000	But I bet there's some people that will for whatever, you know,
4438000	4440000	graphical upgrades and other things they might do with it as well.
4440000	4441000	We'll see.
4442000	4445000	I was going to mention, though, on top of that,
4445000	4449000	Devolver is also doing their press conference,
4449000	4452000	which will be fucking weird as usual.
4452000	4454000	But I love it.
4454000	4456000	Bobby Blackwolf is wondering,
4456000	4459000	will we get Final Fantasy VII Episode 3, though?
4459000	4461000	We're still waiting on Half-Life 2 Episode 3.
4461000	4465000	Well, the good news is we know Square can get a series to 15.
4465000	4466000	Right?
4466000	4469000	Square doesn't stumble on Half-Life 2.
4469000	4473000	Square doesn't stumble on the number 3, unlike some companies,
4473000	4476000	because they've at least got one of their franchises up to 15 games
4476000	4478000	and countless spin-offs.
4478000	4481000	So I think we're doing okay right there.
4481000	4484000	Akdev says, we will get Final Fantasy VII Episode 3,
4484000	4486000	but people will hate it and it will be patched,
4486000	4489000	like Episode 13 and Final Fantasy XV.
4489000	4492000	Oh, my God. All these numbers. I'm going crazy.
4492000	4494000	You know, it's probably going to be there, and I hope it is.
4494000	4498000	It actually is our Avengers game, remember?
4498000	4499000	Oh, yeah.
4499000	4500000	They're supposed to be working on one of those.
4500000	4502000	Sure. I'd like to see that as well.
4502000	4505000	We'll talk some more E3 predictions in a couple weeks,
4505000	4507000	but it's getting exciting.
4507000	4510000	I've got to say, with as much as I'm kind of giving this Final Fantasy VII
4510000	4511000	and the episode thing,
4511000	4514000	and look at all this money you're going to spend, some crap.
4514000	4516000	I've got to say, it looks really good.
4516000	4521000	If it looks that good for some hours and hours of gameplay,
4521000	4523000	it kind of might be worth it.
4523000	4526000	That $180 will be spread out through five years.
4526000	4530000	I just hope this doesn't cease development on another Final Fantasy game,
4530000	4532000	because I know there's some of you out there that are like,
4532000	4535000	oh, no, the Final Fantasy VII remake is Final Fantasy XVI.
4535000	4539000	Maybe not in name, but all the resources that would be going to make
4539000	4541000	a Final Fantasy XVI are going to that remake right now,
4541000	4543000	so you're going to wait twice as long for a Final Fantasy XVI.
4543000	4547000	I hope we see a Final Fantasy VI remake in the same type of style.
4549000	4552000	All right. We need to go back to a simpler time.
4552000	4557000	We need to take a trip back to a time when there were not episodic remakes.
4557000	4562000	There were not Episode VI and Final Fantasy X, II, and all this stuff,
4562000	4565000	but there were generations and generations and generations
4565000	4566000	of maybe different games.
4566000	4570000	We're going to take a trip back with the classic game of the week,
4570000	4572000	and then we'll be back here live in studio.
4574000	4577000	And so we'll take a step back through space and time
4577000	4580000	and this little segment that we do here on Orange Launch Radio
4580000	4583000	called the Classic Game of the Week, where usually,
4583000	4586000	Dark Soccer steps into the gaming vault and finds a game that she thinks,
4586000	4588000	hey, you guys should be checking out this game this week.
4588000	4591000	But as I mentioned earlier in the show, she's not here tonight
4591000	4593000	because she's off doing things for Mother's Day.
4593000	4596000	So as we've been doing this year, we're inviting some special guests
4596000	4598000	onto the show to take care of the Classic Game of the Week,
4598000	4599000	and this week is no different.
4599000	4601000	Welcome back to Orange Launch Radio.
4601000	4604000	Now, all the way from Boise, Idaho,
4604000	4607000	the one-time host of the Ranger Bride Podcast, Shane.
4608000	4609000	Hello.
4609000	4611000	Hello, welcome back.
4611000	4612000	Thank you.
4612000	4615000	It has been a little while since we've had you on the show.
4615000	4620000	Can you summarize the past couple years in one or two sentences?
4625000	4630000	I got married, I moved, and I quit paying attention to Power Rangers.
4630000	4631000	Okay.
4631000	4634000	That sounds like a lot of big changes going on.
4634000	4638000	Well, glad to have you here on the show to help us out with this segment,
4638000	4640000	the Classic Game of the Week.
4640000	4641000	So why don't we get to it?
4641000	4644000	What did you pick for our listeners tonight?
4644000	4645000	Okay.
4645000	4649000	Well, what I picked is very relevant at the moment
4649000	4654000	because there's this little indie movie that just came out.
4654000	4657000	It's called Detective Pikachu.
4657000	4661000	And I'm sure we have not yet talked about it tonight at all.
4661000	4664000	No, not one bit.
4664000	4666000	And while I can't actually...
4666000	4669000	There's a Detective Pikachu game that you guys didn't know,
4669000	4673000	but it doesn't meet the requirements for Classic Game of the Week.
4673000	4674000	Yes.
4674000	4676000	We do have strict rules around here.
4676000	4678000	I don't write them, but I do have to enforce them.
4678000	4683000	So I am taking an aspect of that movie
4683000	4687000	and an aspect of a story that I totally have to tell
4688000	4689000	and combining it.
4689000	4694000	And it's going to give our Classic Game of the Week
4694000	4698000	the big reveal, Pokemon Diamond and Pearl.
4698000	4699000	All right.
4699000	4703000	And what's kind of interesting about this week on Twitch anyway,
4703000	4704000	you don't really see this on the podcast,
4704000	4707000	but we actually show footage from the game in the background
4707000	4709000	of the game that's been picked.
4709000	4713000	And usually we just kind of have like a random let's play from YouTube or something.
4713000	4716000	But tonight, this is actual footage that you shot
4716000	4717000	playing the game.
4717000	4718000	Yep.
4718000	4721000	I have a DS that is modded.
4721000	4723000	Sorry, a 3DS that is modded.
4723000	4726000	2DS that is modded because it's my Pokemon one.
4726000	4730000	And I thought I really haven't used it yet.
4730000	4732000	And if we're going to be doing a Pokemon game,
4732000	4734000	of which I own all of them,
4734000	4738000	we might as well just go ahead and use footage that I get.
4738000	4739000	Awesome.
4739000	4742000	Well, I'm glad that we get to have some unique footage
4742000	4744000	here on the show tonight of the Classic Game.
4744000	4745000	So tell us a little bit about-
4745000	4752000	There may be a special guest star or two in that footage.
4752000	4753000	All right.
4753000	4755000	For those that are on Twitch anyway, we'll keep our eyes peeled.
4755000	4757000	But why this game?
4757000	4759000	Out of the seven generations of Pokemon games,
4759000	4761000	well, I know some of them aren't eligible because they're not 10 years old,
4761000	4762000	but there's been-
4762000	4764000	I know like the one I want to do.
4764000	4765000	I know there's been-
4765000	4766000	One more year and I can do it.
4766000	4769000	I know there's been spinoffs and a variety of things.
4769000	4772000	So why are we bringing this one to the table tonight?
4773000	4775000	Okay, so there's two reasons.
4775000	4778000	The first reason is in Detective Pikachu,
4778000	4785000	all different types of Pokemon are represented from different generations.
4785000	4790000	And I was going through the list on a website that kind of cataloged
4790000	4791000	which ones show up,
4791000	4799000	and I noticed that there was one generation four Pokemon in the entire movie,
4799000	4801000	which still made me feel a little bad.
4801000	4803000	That doesn't count like posters.
4803000	4806000	It doesn't count statues in the movie.
4806000	4810000	I'm talking about physical Pokemon that you can interact with in the movie.
4810000	4813000	And so I was like, well, I get it.
4813000	4818000	Gen four is not the best, but let's do something nice for Gen four today.
4818000	4823000	The second reason is, and I'm not sure if you remember this, Rob,
4823000	4828000	but around the time this game came out, which was April,
4828000	4834000	I'm scrolling up because I don't remember the exact day, April 22nd, 2007,
4834000	4840000	around that time, you, myself, and Jamie took a trip to Disneyland,
4840000	4843000	and one of the things we did was we stopped at a Walmart
4843000	4846000	and I bought Pokemon Diamond on that trip.
4846000	4848000	I do vaguely remember that.
4848000	4851000	Those were the years where we were going to Disneyland all the time
4851000	4852000	because it was reasonably priced.
4852000	4857000	It was like $25 million for a half-day pass.
4857000	4860000	Exactly. I do remember this because this was, you know,
4860000	4864000	I don't think you were at the point where you were buying five copies of every generation,
4864000	4867000	but you were definitely still like, I got to get this game.
4867000	4871000	Yeah, I wasn't even getting both copies at that point.
4871000	4874000	I was just picking one and going with it.
4874000	4878000	So, boy, those were the easy days.
4878000	4881000	So you kind of referenced something there, though,
4881000	4887000	about that this maybe isn't necessarily the best Pokemon game in some people's eyes.
4887000	4890000	Like, this generation is kind of controversial, right?
4890000	4896000	Yeah, it's got a few interesting choices that were made, at least in Diamond and Pearl.
4896000	4900000	That's why I wanted to go with Diamond and Pearl versus Platinum,
4900000	4902000	which would have also qualified for today.
4902000	4908000	But Platinum was your third version in Generation 4's main games,
4908000	4915000	and whenever you get a third version, it usually fixes a lot of problems that the previous games had.
4915000	4924000	So, for example, in Diamond and Pearl, there are all of four different types of Pokemon
4924000	4929000	that you can get throughout the game that have a fire typing,
4929000	4933000	either solid or is double-typed and one of them is fire.
4933000	4941000	Just to make that even worse is that one of those Pokemon that you can get is exclusive to Pearl.
4941000	4949000	So Diamond only gets three types, or three Pokemon, rather, that you can use fire with.
4949000	4952000	And, you know, that might be good enough for a lot of people,
4952000	4960000	but it seems the Pokemon fanbase in general likes to have as much variety as possible,
4960000	4967000	and that really paints you into a corner of having to pick Ho Monkey, or Chimchar, is what he's actually called,
4967000	4972000	if you want a decent fire type in either of the games, honestly.
4972000	4979000	Interesting. So, if you kind of don't pick Chimchar as your starter type, you're going to be boxed in.
4979000	4981000	Is there a grass gym that you have to fight at some point,
4981000	4984000	or something where you kind of need fire types to get through it easier?
4985000	4994000	Yeah, there's... Sorry, you know that grass is not the only thing that is weak to fire.
4994000	4997000	Well, yeah, but it's just the one that comes to mind.
4997000	5005000	Well, you do have a grass, you have ice, so both of those, you get right there, you've got a steel gym.
5005000	5012000	So that's three gyms right there that you would be totally great to have a good fire type with.
5012000	5019000	There's even an Elite Four that is bugged. Well, why don't you burn the bug too?
5019000	5025000	Gotcha. So is that, I mean, is it the variety? Is that where people kind of just had issues,
5025000	5032000	where the Pokemon just got us interesting, or why do people not usually talk about Gen 4 as their fave?
5032000	5037000	Well, you can't really say people don't talk about Gen 4 as their fave,
5037000	5042000	because everybody has a gym that they like, and everybody's very vocal about it,
5042000	5051000	but I think even the people that love Gen 4 can agree that these issues that come up,
5051000	5058000	their pacing is not great in the game, the spread of Pokemon not that great,
5058000	5060000	they find other reasons to love it.
5060000	5068000	One example, the music. When you are hopefully watching that video, can they hear the music?
5068000	5070000	It's going to be faint in the background, but it'll come through.
5070000	5079000	Okay. When the character goes up to the lake very early on, the music at the lake is amazing.
5079000	5087000	I haven't played Gen 4, to be honest, in years and years and years, because it's not Gen 5, why would I care?
5087000	5092000	But they did a really good job with the music in this game.
5092000	5101000	And I know that the storyline, and this applies to people complaining nowadays about the newer Pokemon,
5101000	5104000	the storyline in this game is actually pretty dark.
5104000	5113000	The evil team basically wants to wipe out everything and start all over, so everybody dies.
5113000	5114000	Yikes.
5114000	5118000	And for what's a kid's game, that's a little harsh.
5118000	5120000	So what about some of the good things, though?
5120000	5125000	Because obviously it'd be weird if we sat here and just talked about all the bad things about a classic game of the week,
5125000	5131000	but surely there must have been things that Gen 4 brought to the table that future Pokemon games influenced.
5131000	5135000	You know, Gen 2 was the first one with gender outside of Nidoran.
5135000	5141000	Gen 3 had the berries. There's other stuff, too. What was new in Gen 4?
5142000	5149000	So, the battle system in Gen 4, it changed up how attacks worked.
5149000	5158000	It now, in Gen 4, attacks are either physical or special by how the attack actually operates.
5158000	5161000	So, like, if it touches the enemy or not.
5161000	5167000	That wasn't the case in the games up to this point.
5167000	5175000	So, Thunder Punch is physical because it's a punch, and Hyper Beam would be special.
5175000	5182000	So that's actually something that's been carried forward since the introduction in Gen 4.
5182000	5188000	So, that's definitely a legacy that you can look back to Gen 4 and be like,
5188000	5195000	okay, this is where it started, this is why Pokemon Battle feels better, to be honest.
5195000	5198000	And this was the first game that was dual screen, right?
5198000	5201000	Because Gen 3 was a Game Boy Advance game, right?
5201000	5204000	So Gen 4 was the first, like, dual screen, yeah, yeah.
5204000	5209000	Correct. And, while it does dual screen, and probably because of it,
5209000	5214000	a negative for you is that it dropped back down to 30 frames a second.
5214000	5220000	So, I don't think many people care about that, but, you know, just a little trivia there.
5220000	5221000	Yeah, interesting.
5221000	5226000	Well, and plus, I guess it should be noted that, you know, now that we know that Gen 9, no, 8,
5226000	5230000	I always lose count, Gen 8 is gonna be on the Switch.
5230000	5233000	I mean, presumably, we're going back to a single screen format.
5233000	5239000	So it's like 4, 5, 6, and 7 will all kind of exist in this double screen world that is essentially,
5239000	5242000	as far as we know, anyway, is gonna be gone on the Switch version.
5242000	5246000	I mean, we don't know, they might split the screen on the Switch, they might do something,
5246000	5249000	but we're kind of assuming we're going back to single screen.
5249000	5254000	Let's go Pikachu and Eevee, those abominations of Pokemon games.
5254000	5257000	They were single screen.
5257000	5259000	That's true, that's true.
5259000	5265000	But, I mean, I guess those are, I count those as spin-offs, but I guess they are kind of Gen 1 remakes in a way.
5265000	5270000	But the Pokemon company does not count them as spin-offs, they count them as mainline games.
5270000	5272000	Which is a whole other fight for another day.
5272000	5273000	Yeah, I guess so.
5273000	5278000	Well, speaking of, like, remakes and all that stuff, did they ever remake Gen 4?
5278000	5281000	Not yet. It would technically be next in line.
5281000	5287000	Yeah, I was gonna say, it should be the next one to be remade, but maybe not, because they went back to Gen 1, right?
5289000	5292000	Yeah, they did.
5292000	5296000	Much to a lot of people's chagrins.
5296000	5308000	But, you know, I feel like since they're moving everything over from their quote-unquote handheld division of systems,
5308000	5311000	even though the Switch is handheld but it can be whatever,
5311000	5315000	they needed to start off with something they felt was strong,
5315000	5321000	and unfortunately, just do the Gen 1 pandering and that should be strong enough.
5321000	5325000	I know this is a Gen 4 discussion,
5325000	5330000	and I'd be a terrible host if I didn't ask, why do you not care for Gen 1, it seems?
5330000	5333000	I mean, I guess, like, Gen 1, I don't know.
5333000	5339000	Like, I think maybe because of Pokemon Go or people being kids that are, like, 30 and 40 now that were kids when Gen 1 came out.
5339000	5345000	It seems like there's so much nostalgia in Gen 1, but you don't like it nearly as much.
5345000	5349000	You probably like Gen 4 more than you like Gen 1.
5349000	5352000	You're probably right.
5352000	5355000	It's just the mechanics, the pacing.
5355000	5359000	I don't like the Pokemon for the most part in Gen 1.
5359000	5367000	I know that's a terrible thing to say, but outside of just a handful, they're not that interesting to me.
5367000	5376000	But, you know, I get a lot of crap because my favorite's Gen 5, which is basically a remake of Gen 1, but using entirely different Pokemon.
5376000	5379000	And I'm cool with that. I think it's great.
5379000	5383000	And Gen 1 was my first game, too, so I don't even have that nostalgia there.
5383000	5391000	But maybe I had, like, a rebirth of nostalgia because I was kind of, you know, not very hardcore into it until Gen 5 came out.
5391000	5395000	Then I just threw myself into it and never looked back.
5395000	5406000	Well, if you want to compare to another geek culture thing, Episode 7 was essentially a remake of Episode 4, but we had to suffer through Episodes 1, 2, and 3 to get there. Right?
5406000	5408000	I'm talking Star Wars.
5408000	5409000	That's correct.
5409000	5412000	Because, like, Episode 7 of what?
5412000	5415000	Star Wars. Right.
5415000	5423000	The segment's running a little long and we've got to get back to the show, but I have to ask about the actual... What?
5423000	5427000	I have one more thing I have to say about that real quick before you say anything.
5427000	5436000	Because there is one major thing that I did not hit on that's super important is that Gen 4 introduced the global trade system.
5436000	5443000	So, that way you can throw Pokémon up, get something randomly docked.
5443000	5453000	And that is, oh yeah, because, like, you know, I remember using that in X and Y and the Sun and Moon, and, like, you'd just throw garbage out there and you'd get, like, hacked Pokémon in return.
5453000	5456000	Yeah, that's why I never used it.
5456000	5459000	My Pokémon are legit.
5459000	5463000	The thing I wanted to ask about before we go back to the live show is the Pokémon themselves.
5463000	5469000	We've talked about a couple of them. I don't know if you don't want to name the one that's in the movie because maybe it's a potential spoiler.
5469000	5475000	And we talked about Chimchar, but, like, what are your, I mean, surely, even if Gen 4 is kind of like your, eh, it's all right.
5475000	5479000	Like, what are, like, some of your favorite Pokémon that Gen 4 introduced?
5479000	5484000	Oh, that, ooh, ooh, ooh, okay.
5484000	5488000	I would say Shinx. Shinx's entire line. I love that.
5488000	5498000	I actually still have, to this day, my original Shinx that I caught in that copy of Diamond. I passed him through the games all the way up.
5498000	5508000	So, um, he would be my favorite. Um, what other ones are there?
5508000	5513000	Well, my favorite is Bidoof and the most, the most memeable Pokémon, maybe, besides Mudkip.
5514000	5516000	Yours is Bidoof.
5516000	5522000	Um, okay, so, I like all the starters. All the starters for Gen 4 are great.
5522000	5527000	Like, Churchwig through Empoleon, you guys are great.
5527000	5532000	Uh, they have a really good bird line in Starly, going up to Staraptor.
5532000	5535000	And then we did Shinx and Luxray, got that out of the way.
5536000	5543000	And then, really, after that, um, not, not seeing a whole lot.
5543000	5548000	And, and I know this from playing Pokémon GO, which we should, you know, mention.
5548000	5552000	Gen 4 is the most recent gen you can catch in Pokémon GO.
5552000	5557000	They haven't unleashed Gen 5 yet, so kind of Gen 4 is, like, the new stuff, even though it's been a few months.
5557000	5564000	But, you know, you kind of notice through Gen 4, there's a lot of, like, babies of earlier Pokémon, right?
5564000	5566000	Like Munchlax, there's, like, a baby Snorlax, right?
5566000	5571000	And there's also future evolutions of some of the, you know, Gen 1 Pokémon.
5571000	5578000	Like, uh, Magmortar is there, Electrovire, um, and then, like, Togepi from Gen 2 got Togekiss, right?
5578000	5585000	So, it's interesting that, like, a lot of Gen 4 is kind of just, like, evolves and devolves of some of the original Pokémon.
5585000	5592000	Yeah, and I guess that's, uh, sort of a theme you could put on to Gen 4, is that this one is all about
5592000	5602000	breeding and evolution, so they give you new babies and new Evos for things that really didn't need them, or should have had them earlier.
5602000	5604000	Alright. Well, um,
5604000	5612000	We also got, uh, because it's not GO yet, we also got new Eevee evolutions, because it's an even numbered generation, so that was cool.
5612000	5616000	That's right, and those haven't showed up in GO yet. GO doesn't have all of Gen 4 yet, just a big chunk of it.
5616000	5620000	Nope. It's gonna take, like, another year or so for the five left.
5620000	5631000	Alright, well, we gotta wrap up and head back, uh, live to the studio, but there it is, your Classic Game of the Week, uh, a timely selection with the new movie that everybody's talking about this week, but it's Pokémon Diamond and Pearl.
5631000	5636000	And, uh, Shane, thank you for being here and filling in tonight. Do you have, uh, anything else you wanna say?
5636000	5641000	Uh, you wanna give a quick spoiler-free review of Detective Pikachu real quick?
5642000	5655000	It was really, really awesome, and if you are a Pokémon fan at all, you will walk out of the theater wishing you could go to Rhyme City and live there forever.
5655000	5664000	I have to kind of agree with you, that's kind of how I felt. I just, I loved, and I probably already said this earlier in the show, but I'll say it again, I loved how it just unapologetically made Pokémon real.
5664000	5667000	Like, they've, they've just, they've just always been there.
5667000	5677000	And they did a great job with the designs, but there are, like, a couple standouts that are nightmare fuel. Like, absolute nightmare fuel.
5677000	5683000	I won't say, because I don't want to spoil, because at least one of them has not shown up in the trailer, so.
5683000	5694000	Yeah, that's fair, that's fair. Alright, well, before we get into spoiler territory, we will go back to the show. Um, is there any, like, social media, I know you don't have a podcast regularly anymore, but is there anything you want to plug, social media or anything like that?
5694000	5696000	No, not really.
5696000	5702000	Alright. Well, thanks for being here, Shane, and we're gonna head back to the show live.
5702000	5704000	Alright.
5704000	5710000	Alright, we're back. Thanks so much to Shane for helping to fill in this week with the Classic Game of the Week.
5710000	5719000	I kind of, I kind of thought he might pick a Pokémon game, so it all worked out, because I know a lot of people were talking about that this week, but I like how he kind of tied it into the movie.
5719000	5733000	And, yeah, I didn't really think about that, but I guess there's really only, like, one Gen 4 Pokémon, again, I don't know if it's spoilery, so I won't say who, but, uh, that shows up in the game, so it's, it was kind of, like, not as well represented as maybe some other generations in the, uh, movie.
5733000	5736000	I mean, I would have expected a lot of Gen 1 stuff.
5736000	5739000	I think they had stuff sprinkled around, just not, like, main character.
5739000	5741000	Yeah, he said there's, like, statues and paintings and things.
5741000	5750000	Well, no, I think there's actually, um, like, legit Gen 4 Pokémon that were walking around, like, in the, like, especially in the beginning, like, where it's kind of showing just, like, the city.
5750000	5751000	Yeah.
5751000	5752000	Gotcha.
5752000	5756000	Uh, and, uh, S2100Matt says, Shane is currently seeing it his fifth time.
5756000	5769000	I think he actually is on his second. He did say he was going back to see it on Sunday, but I don't think it's going to turn into, like, uh, Love, Simon, which he saw, like, 40 or 45 times in theater, and that's not a figure of speech, like, it was 40 times in theater, so I don't think it's going to be that.
5769000	5779000	But, uh, yeah, it's good to have him back on the show, so even though we miss Dark Soccer tonight, but she'll be back next week, and I think she'll be due for a soundtrack next week, so stay tuned for that.
5779000	5784000	In the meantime, we're going to get back into what we're doing here tonight. Sadly, I still don't have Jason in the studio.
5784000	5789000	I know his ETA was 730, but that was before he pulled over in a safe way to use the Wi-Fi.
5789000	5793000	So, hopefully, everything's still okay with him. We'll get to hear from him a little later on in the show.
5793000	5796000	We still got some ground to cover, though, before we get there, right?
5796000	5797000	Yeah.
5797000	5798000	Let's get to some rapid-fire news, Logie.
5798000	5806000	Alright, so, for May, we're getting some new games for the Nintendo Switch Online NES Archive service.
5806000	5813000	So, we've got, um, starting off with Donkey Kong Jr., Clu Clu Land, and VS Excitebike.
5813000	5818000	So, those will be, um, available on the 15th, in a few more days.
5818000	5825000	And then, uh, we've got a brand new Super Monkey Ball game, apparently coming out soon.
5825000	5831000	Apparently, Sega has filed a trademark in Japan for Tabe Goro Super Monkey Ball.
5831000	5838000	And, apparently, Tabe Goro translates to riper in season or good to eat, something along those lines.
5838000	5847000	The thought, I think, was that this might be almost like a, um, like a kind of a classic remake or something,
5847000	5850000	like they did with the Sonic games.
5850000	5853000	So, maybe we'll see that with Super Monkey Ball instead.
5855000	5859000	Which I would be totally cool with because, um, I thought Super Monkey Ball was a lot of fun.
5859000	5861000	We haven't seen one of those games in a while.
5861000	5862000	No, long time.
5862000	5864000	The last one I could think of was, like, on the Wii, maybe with the motion controls.
5864000	5865000	It's about the last time I could think of.
5865000	5870000	Well, apparently, the last one actually was released, um, in 2014 on iOS and Android.
5870000	5872000	Oh, right. Of course, of course, because there was a mobile phone one, of course.
5872000	5873000	Yes.
5873000	5874000	Of course. Alright.
5874000	5877000	Um, some other rapid-fire news, uh, stories to talk about.
5877000	5881000	I mentioned we'd talk about some of the other things that came up during the state of play with PlayStation.
5881000	5886000	And this was one that certainly caught my eye, is that they are making a game out of Predator.
5886000	5889000	Which, I mean, you know, Predator has had plenty of games.
5889000	5891000	And I mean, like, the movie, right? The Predator.
5891000	5897000	Uh, so, uh, Predator's had certain video games before, but this is a new one called Predator Hunting Grounds.
5897000	5901000	Uh, it is supposed to be a competitive online multiplayer experience.
5901000	5906000	So, that kind of sounds like one person's the predator and the rest are the prey.
5906000	5908000	It's Friday the 13th all over again.
5908000	5909000	Exactly.
5909000	5911000	Or, what's the other one?
5911000	5912000	Evolve will be in...
5912000	5914000	No, not Evolve. There's, um...
5914000	5915000	Dead by Daylight.
5915000	5916000	Yeah.
5916000	5917000	Yeah, those types of things.
5917000	5918000	So, uh...
5918000	5921000	Didn't one of those have the Predator in it? I may be thinking of Call of Duty did, like, that thing.
5921000	5927000	Um, Dead by Daylight has a lot of the, I almost said Scream Queens, but Slasher.
5927000	5932000	Uh, because I think they just spotted the ghost face from, um, Scream is supposed to be coming to that.
5932000	5933000	And, uh, some other things.
5933000	5936000	But I don't know if Predator is one of them in Dead by Daylight.
5936000	5939000	Another thing, it was for Call of Duty, it was one of the, um...
5939000	5943000	I think it was Black Ops 3 or something like that, where they did, um...
5943000	5946000	Like, a special event where you could become the Predator type thing.
5946000	5949000	Hi, Jason. Good to see you in studio.
5949000	5952000	If you're gonna put your face on the camera, I have to acknowledge you, because the Twitch people are gonna be like,
5952000	5953000	What's that? How you doing?
5953000	5954000	Yeah.
5954000	5955000	Yeah.
5955000	5959000	Is this microphone ready for the deep, dulcet tones that are certainly not Jamie's voice?
5959000	5962000	I think so. In fact, it might actually be tuned a little high, because Jamie...
5962000	5963000	Or, you know what I mean.
5963000	5964000	Yeah.
5964000	5965000	You might be actually coming through a little loud.
5965000	5967000	More reverberary versus more airy and...
5967000	5968000	A little bit.
5968000	5969000	Yeah.
5969000	5971000	So we were just talking about Predator coming out on PlayStation.
5971000	5974000	Do you like the Friday the 13th? No.
5974000	5979000	I've never seen any... I've seen bits and pieces of Alien, I've never seen anything Predator.
5979000	5983000	I've enjoyed some of the Dead by Daylight and Friday the 13th stuff that I've watched.
5983000	5984000	Okay.
5984000	5987000	Yeah, Dead by Daylight is a huge Twitch game.
5987000	5990000	I know you've been participating for a long time in Twitch culture.
5990000	5992000	And we're probably one of the people that were like,
5992000	5994000	you know, OLR should have moved to Twitch a long time ago.
5994000	5998000	But Dead by Daylight is huge in Twitch culture.
5998000	6000000	That's a very popular stream game out there.
6000000	6005000	Yeah. It's very role-playable and repeatedly role-playable.
6005000	6008000	Yes. I'm just going to turn your volume down just a tad.
6008000	6009000	Whoa, whoa, whoa.
6009000	6010000	Just a little bit.
6010000	6013000	All right. You're fine. You don't have to make those noises. It's a little weird.
6013000	6014000	All right. Anyway.
6014000	6016000	I just like looking at the fancy little dials you have up here.
6016000	6017000	Yeah.
6017000	6018000	I haven't been here since this setup.
6018000	6021000	It's been quite literally a year because we tend to,
6021000	6024000	work tends to have our all hands around May-ish.
6024000	6027000	Yeah. So this is the first time you've seen it with the whole video setup.
6027000	6031000	It's really, if you think about it, or I mean, as you can attest to,
6031000	6033000	it's not that different from what it was before,
6033000	6039000	except for I was more facing the wall instead of actually looking at my co-hosts.
6039000	6041000	Now it's all like video production and shit.
6041000	6045000	I know. I know. The very first video production we ever did,
6045000	6048000	I got a note that said, Rob, you never look at your co-hosts.
6048000	6051000	I'm like, it's radio. I don't have to.
6051000	6053000	We had to change that.
6053000	6055000	There's a lot of things, for all the things that you don't see,
6055000	6059000	it's always fun to kind of look back and be able to sit there
6059000	6062000	and hear all of the camaraderie and interaction.
6062000	6065000	And then the fact that everybody is paying attention to each other
6065000	6069000	and participating, but not necessarily in the showy presentation,
6069000	6072000	not necessarily needing all of the obvious body language
6072000	6073000	and everything else that you deal with.
6073000	6077000	It's just multitasking, or it's like having a phone call or something,
6077000	6080000	or playing games online, talking on Discord or something like that.
6080000	6081000	That's kind of like what it was.
6081000	6083000	But I do think there's always been a very,
6083000	6086000	not to toot our own horn very much,
6086000	6088000	but I think part of what's made this show unique
6088000	6091000	out of the literally thousands of gaming podcasts that are out there,
6091000	6094000	not just how fucking long we've been doing it for 13 years,
6094000	6097000	but the fact that we're in the same room doing it.
6097000	6099000	Now, I know there's other shows that do it that way too,
6099000	6105000	but I would say 5 or 10 percent tops are doing it in all the same room.
6105000	6107000	And I think that's part of what makes this a little bit special.
6107000	6109000	So, yeah, fun. Anyway.
6109000	6110000	All right, so let's get back.
6110000	6111000	It's the longest running in many ways.
6111000	6113000	Let's get back into some other rapid fire news,
6113000	6115000	and I'll come back and ask you about your gaming week
6115000	6118000	and all that fun stuff and your trip today,
6118000	6119000	because I still think that's hilarious,
6119000	6122000	that you pulled over at a Safeway to get us the bump tonight.
6122000	6124000	And your intro, you very clearly didn't give a fuck,
6124000	6125000	and I thought it was great.
6125000	6128000	But let's talk about Castlevania.
6128000	6129000	Oh, yes, that's a series we all love,
6129000	6134000	and there's some new music that is coming out on the different streaming sites.
6134000	6138000	So, new Castlevania soundtracks, or I should say old Castlevania soundtracks,
6138000	6141000	are new again thanks to showing up on streaming websites,
6141000	6143000	which include Spotify, which I know a lot of you use,
6143000	6146000	Apple Music, and Google Play.
6146000	6149000	Soundtracks such as Castlevania Symphony of the Night,
6149000	6152000	and Castlevania 64, Castlevania Chronicles, Curse of Darkness,
6152000	6154000	Portrait of Ruin, and so forth.
6154000	6157000	And, Jason, just be aware we can see your laptop a little bit,
6157000	6159000	so just in case you're doing anything sensitive on there.
6159000	6163000	If you need to see the monitor, it's up there and shows you what they can see.
6163000	6167000	I still want you to bring up work stuff or something that might be sensitive,
6167000	6168000	because you never know.
6168000	6169000	It's all blown out.
6169000	6171000	All right.
6171000	6176000	Anyway, you can check out the Castlevania soundtracks on those various websites,
6176000	6179000	which maybe I'll do later on.
6179000	6180000	That sounds like a plan.
6180000	6185000	Anyway, let's travel around the world and check out what is coming out in a store near you
6185000	6188000	with some world release dates.
6188000	6189000	Yes.
6189000	6192000	So, we've got a few things coming out this week.
6192000	6200000	So, starting off with a Plague Tale, Innocence, on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.
6200000	6203000	Darkwood on PlayStation 4.
6203000	6207000	Rage 2 is coming out this week on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.
6207000	6210000	Redout on Nintendo Switch.
6210000	6215000	World End Syndrome on the Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4.
6215000	6220000	Bubsy, Paws on Fire on PC, Switch, and PlayStation 4.
6220000	6225000	Speaking of Castlevania, the Castlevania Anniversary Collection is coming out this week.
6225000	6229000	PC, Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.
6229000	6234000	And then, of course, Darkwood is also coming out other days during this week on other systems,
6234000	6236000	so on Switch and Xbox One as well.
6236000	6238000	And that is it.
6238000	6241000	I wonder if that's kind of why they put out all those Castlevania soundtracks now,
6241000	6245000	is to get people talking about Castlevania just in time for that collection to be on its way out to stores.
6245000	6246000	Maybe.
6246000	6247000	Maybe.
6247000	6248000	Anyway, going to Japan.
6248000	6251000	It's been a little slow in Japan because we're just off the heels of Golden Week,
6251000	6254000	but we finally actually have some releases this week in Japan,
6254000	6258000	even though it still is a little slow as we ramp up back after the holidays in Japan.
6258000	6265000	But we do have Ys, Memory of Celceta, coming out this week on the PlayStation 4.
6265000	6270000	So that Ys series has been around forever, so that is pretty cool that that is coming out.
6270000	6276000	And then over on the Nintendo Switch, Roller Coaster Tycoon Adventures gets a kind of localized,
6276000	6279000	they're actually labeling it a multi-language release, but that is coming out in Japan.
6279000	6289000	And Hanayakanari Waga Ichi Zoku Modern Nostalgia for Nintendo Switch in a regular and limited edition.
6289000	6293000	That is really the only other release out there this week.
6294000	6297000	Oh, this came out on PlayStation 4 not that long ago.
6297000	6302000	It's like you're finally getting to marry the maid girl of your dreams is what it looks like.
6302000	6304000	Or at least, I don't know, it's kind of one of those visual novel type of games.
6304000	6307000	Gee, I never would have imagined where they'd get that storyline from.
6307000	6308000	I know.
6308000	6310000	What a completely unique...
6310000	6312000	Good help is hard to marry.
6312000	6313000	Yeah.
6313000	6314000	Stop it.
6314000	6320000	Anyway, we are going to get into the UK release dates, then we'll get to the mailbag.
6320000	6327000	Yeah, so the UK also has Rage 2 coming out as well on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.
6327000	6331000	Plague Tale Innocence on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
6331000	6335000	Guilty Gear 20th Anniversary Edition on the Nintendo Switch.
6335000	6338000	Wasteland 2 on the Nintendo Switch.
6338000	6343000	Sniper Elite V2 Remastered on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and the Switch.
6343000	6349000	And last but not least, the Steven Universe Double Pack on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and the Switch.
6350000	6353000	Alright, let's head on over to the mailbag.
6353000	6355000	Every week we invite you guys to email us.
6355000	6360000	Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com and we read our favorite emails here on the air.
6360000	6362000	Or else we talk about RuPaul's Drag Race.
6362000	6365000	But we did get one email this week to save you from Drag Race discussion,
6365000	6367000	which is probably for the best because Jamie's not here tonight.
6367000	6369000	So do you watch RuPaul's Drag Race, Jason?
6369000	6370000	No.
6370000	6372000	It's probably for the best. We did get an email tonight.
6372000	6374000	An email from YYR who emailed us to say,
6374000	6382000	Hello, LR. This email has been sent to acknowledge the Dream Game submission from last week's episode on Sunday, May 5th.
6382000	6386000	Your submission has been received. Please allow two to three months for processing.
6386000	6389000	Thank you for using the YYR game's Dream Game submission service.
6389000	6391000	I don't even remember what I said.
6391000	6393000	And now I'm worried.
6393000	6395000	Chat, what did we say for a Dream Game?
6395000	6398000	I seriously don't even remember what we said for a Dream Game last week.
6398000	6399000	That's how this show goes.
6399000	6403000	I just say things and then a week goes by and I'm like, what?
6403000	6405000	So, uh, yeah.
6405000	6409000	A lot of people in the chat are like, I forgot too.
6409000	6411000	Well, luckily we have a girlfriend.
6411000	6413000	A week ago? I don't know what happened two days ago.
6413000	6415000	Wait, you want me to go back and listen? I know, I can't even remember what I did yesterday.
6415000	6417000	What day it is? What day is tomorrow?
6417000	6422000	I know, if you ask me what missions in Ingress I did literally earlier today, I'd be like, um...
6422000	6424000	The ones where you hack portals and destroy other ones.
6424000	6426000	There was one at Sutter's Fort.
6426000	6431000	Anyway, thank you for the email.
6431000	6434000	If you want to send us an email, participate at orangetontrader.com.
6434000	6437000	Oh, shit, Darktitsui, I can't even remember what it was.
6437000	6439000	So, it didn't happen, almost.
6439000	6441000	If our historian can't remember...
6441000	6445000	That would be funny because if YYR is serious, then he might be exploring actually making a game out of it.
6445000	6448000	Which, I don't know, he might just be in a tease or whatever.
6448000	6453000	It would be really funny that when he's ready to debut, he'd be like, remember when he asked for this?
6453000	6455000	No!
6455000	6457000	No, but actually, you know what'll happen?
6457000	6464000	It'll be because, like, I'll be like, when he says the name, I'll be like, oh fuck, I did say that, didn't I?
6464000	6465000	That's usually how this...
6465000	6467000	I did say that, didn't I?
6467000	6468000	Oh, man.
6468000	6470000	Wow, I'm horrible.
6470000	6471000	Alright, anyway.
6471000	6473000	Uh, Jason, we can use the opportunity to catch up with you a little bit.
6473000	6474000	Howdy, Rob.
6474000	6475000	How are you doing?
6475000	6476000	Long time, no see.
6476000	6480000	So, I know you're in the chair where the viewers can't see you as well, just because...
6480000	6484000	I knew you were coming here mid-show, so I didn't have time to, like, figure out what the spacing would be like over here.
6484000	6485000	I can just kinda do...
6485000	6486000	Oh, is the mic gonna fit?
6486000	6487000	Do one of these numbers.
6487000	6489000	Okay, you're gonna come up...
6489000	6490000	Ah, fuck Pikachu.
6490000	6491000	Alright.
6491000	6492000	Hi, buddy!
6492000	6494000	He's getting enough air time, we don't really frickin' need him.
6494000	6496000	Just all these stuffed animals going everywhere, who cares?
6496000	6498000	Okay, why don't you have that guy on your shoulder there?
6498000	6500000	He'd be a little Pokemon partner.
6500000	6503000	How have you been?
6503000	6507000	Especially in very, very recent times, quite busy.
6507000	6508000	Yeah?
6508000	6509000	Um...
6509000	6510000	That's good, though.
6510000	6512000	That's better than sitting around being sad.
6512000	6513000	Yeah.
6513000	6514000	I mean, that still happens, too.
6514000	6515000	That's life.
6515000	6516000	Yeah, I'm so desperate.
6516000	6517000	That's life.
6517000	6518000	We all have our sad days.
6518000	6525000	Um, I have been following a wrestling promotion back home on and off for the last three years and change.
6525000	6530000	Um, and when I was at TwitchCon San Jose last October, um...
6530000	6531000	How was that?
6531000	6532000	I'm sad I made...
6532000	6535000	They did it on, like, the worst possible weekend for me.
6535000	6536000	Yeah.
6536000	6537000	The worst...
6537000	6538000	It's better this year, because it's September and not Halloween.
6538000	6539000	It is.
6539000	6541000	And one of my friends is moving to San Diego, so I might have a place to stay.
6541000	6543000	It's in San Diego again, which is even better.
6543000	6544000	Frickin' love Gaslamp.
6544000	6545000	That place was amazing.
6545000	6547000	Hands easily the best to date.
6547000	6549000	Um, it was...
6549000	6550000	It was busy.
6550000	6551000	It was hectic.
6551000	6552000	It was growing.
6552000	6554000	It was everything that a con is supposed to be.
6554000	6558000	Um, you know, my personal opinions aside, it certainly went off and they did amazing
6558000	6562000	stuff, um, as they always do with content production and good expos.
6562000	6567000	Uh, a lot of stuff that we saw in progress with TwitchExtensions really starting to grow
6567000	6569000	that we've seen a lot over the last couple of years.
6570000	6571000	We're just kind of budding back then.
6571000	6575000	And we've seen Twitch Sings that has debuted officially over the last couple of months.
6575000	6579000	And for the music streamers that I follow, it's been fun seeing them do that.
6579000	6582000	Add that to their repertoire of the content that they create on there as well.
6582000	6584000	I'm thinking about it.
6584000	6585000	I'm thinking about it, Twitch.
6585000	6586000	But I'm not.
6586000	6587000	I'm not a singer.
6587000	6590000	Somebody has some, uh, somebody has some history with songs.
6590000	6591000	I don't know.
6591000	6594000	I don't know what'll get added to the library, but we could have a reprieve over here.
6594000	6595000	No.
6595000	6600000	My concern, and this will totally make sense why I say it's a concern slash, but it's also
6600000	6601000	a positive.
6601000	6605000	My concern is that if I do a Twitch Sings stream, it will give Travis Donovan a reason
6605000	6608000	to come back, which don't get me wrong.
6608000	6609000	That's the good side.
6609000	6612000	Him coming back to do a show would be a good thing, but he would, he would embarrass me
6612000	6616000	every single week with whatever I decided to sing.
6616000	6619000	If I just, it's like a prayer in Twitch Sings.
6619000	6621000	I haven't paid any attention.
6621000	6624000	I can't even, I think I know Disney songs and that's pretty much it.
6625000	6629000	I sang that song in a karaoke booth like 20 years ago and got a 15 year sentence for
6629000	6630000	it.
6630000	6634000	So, you know, was it one of the ones that grades you however the hell that works?
6634000	6637000	No, Travis Donovan and his audience graded me for the next 15 years.
6637000	6638000	Even better.
6638000	6639000	It'll actually be accurate.
6639000	6643000	I went to some Korean, uh, Korean system karaoke.
6643000	6644000	Where was that?
6644000	6648000	Uh, as a matter of fact, I think it was in San Diego, um, that I was out there for work
6648000	6651000	and, uh, it gives you a score on a scale of a hundred at the very end.
6651000	6653000	And who even, I don't even.
6653000	6654000	Oh yeah.
6654000	6657000	Back in the DDR days when we were going to all those tournaments and all that shit, right?
6657000	6662000	We went to a tournament in Koreatown in LA and I remember there was a DDR tournament
6662000	6667000	going on, but I, it was freestyle and I wasn't like judging or anything and I'm not good
6667000	6668000	at freestyle.
6668000	6671000	Like it's always like they did perfect attack in the morning and then freestyle.
6671000	6672000	So I would do my perfect tackling.
6672000	6676000	So anyway, my point is princess Irene and I ended up going in one of those karaoke booths
6676000	6677000	in the back of the Korean arcade.
6677000	6681000	And I, I shit you not, we spent at least like three hours in that thing while the entire
6681000	6682000	freestyle tournament was going on.
6682000	6687000	We were singing and it was one of those things that would grade you because I remember, I
6687000	6690000	remember the song that I got a hundred percent on.
6690000	6691000	Oh shit.
6691000	6696000	To this day, all through the night by Cyndi Lauper.
6696000	6699000	Not one of her biggest hits.
6699000	6704000	I would sing it for you, but I'm not going to do that because it will be a clip anyway.
6704000	6711000	Uh, yeah, so when, uh, on the very last day of the con on Sunday, um, the wrestling promotion
6711000	6716000	back home had a morning, uh, panel and I didn't wake up for it in time.
6716000	6718000	Fuck mornings and cons.
6718000	6719000	I go, I go there for the people anyway.
6719000	6720000	So it's like, Hey, that's happening.
6720000	6721000	Okay, cool.
6721000	6722000	I'll see you back home anyways.
6722000	6726000	Uh, and I was, as I was wrapping up for lunch, I literally was collecting my trash and standing
6726000	6731000	up and an individual with the promotion came in, sat down and set the Twitch championship
6731000	6734000	title, which the promotion owns, sets it right on the table.
6734000	6740000	I look at it, I look at him, I say, I know you, I missed your panel today, but I know
6740000	6741000	you.
6741000	6744000	Um, and so the long and the short of it is that, uh, what's the promotion?
6744000	6745000	Are you allowed to talk about it?
6745000	6746000	Absolutely.
6746000	6751000	Uh, Rocky mountain pro, uh, is based in technically golden Colorado.
6751000	6754000	It'll be said as just Denver, uh, more often.
6754000	6758000	Um, they that's, that's kind of like any place in Colorado.
6758000	6763000	People are like, Oh, Denver, Denver, Denver's kind of, it's either Denver border, Colorado
6763000	6765000	Springs or fricking flatlands.
6765000	6769000	Even when you used to say Colorado Springs, I'd be like, isn't that near Denver?
6769000	6772000	I live halfway in between Denver and Colorado Springs.
6772000	6773000	You know what?
6773000	6776000	If I travel to Canada or something and I'm like, yeah, I'm from Sacramento, California,
6776000	6777000	huh?
6777000	6778000	The Capitol, huh?
6778000	6780000	It's like two hours outside San Francisco.
6780000	6781000	Oh, okay.
6781000	6786000	But yet, equidistant on I-5 if you're coming, if you're going north to San Francisco.
6786000	6794000	Um, as of the end of last year, uh, they tape live and stream and in the last month have
6794000	6798000	a TV deal every single Thursday for two hours of content.
6798000	6807000	Uh, they had a big camp weekend with a bunch of indie hopefuls and, uh, in the legacy,
6807000	6812000	like legacy, legacy, big tier names that were in for a whole weekend of training and had
6812000	6816000	events every single day, Thursday through Sunday.
6816000	6820000	Um, and that kind of inspired me to decide to get up and be part of the festivities.
6820000	6827000	So I have been working with them since, uh, I think it was the last week of March.
6827000	6828000	What are you doing?
6828000	6829000	Promotions?
6829000	6830000	Or do you, do you actually like commentate?
6830000	6831000	Cause your voice would be perfect.
6831000	6835000	I, uh, when we, when we've done that in testing, I can't keep up with the speech.
6835000	6840000	I, I've been so detached from wrestling that the detail is so hard for me to keep up with.
6840000	6842000	Video game commentating is a similar thing.
6842000	6844000	You have to practice and practice a lot.
6844000	6850000	Um, I chiefly have been doing audio production for them, so actually getting mixers and everything
6850000	6852000	else in order, working with the audio equipment they have.
6852000	6855000	I've made a couple donations of my own.
6855000	6856000	Yeah.
6856000	6859000	Considering that if the camera wasn't on, that was going to be the very first thing
6859000	6860000	I was going to come and do.
6860000	6863000	I was going to walk in and go, this sounds a little weird.
6863000	6864000	This sounds a little weird.
6864000	6865000	Okay.
6865000	6866000	Listen to it again later.
6866000	6867000	You can do it after the show.
6867000	6870000	You have free, you have free, you can, I will let, there's not a lot of people I will say
6870000	6871000	this to Jason, but you can touch things.
6871000	6873000	You can touch things after the show.
6873000	6875000	Shinies!
6875000	6878000	If Bobby Blackwoofer here, don't touch, don't touch that.
6878000	6879000	Don't touch that.
6879000	6881000	You can, you can touch your own show.
6881000	6883000	Go back to your Commodore.
6883000	6884000	Uh, I'm kidding.
6884000	6886000	I tease Bobby because I can and I know he's watching.
6886000	6891000	Um, so, uh, you would enjoy the, the wrestling stuff they do at the theater where we do Rocky
6891000	6892000	Horror.
6892000	6894000	I know I'm getting off base from video games, but whatever.
6894000	6896000	They do, they do like at the colonial, the colonial.
6896000	6897000	Yeah.
6897000	6899000	They do like a minor league wrestling thing.
6899000	6900000	Yeah.
6900000	6901000	Anyway.
6901000	6902000	Yeah.
6902000	6904000	It's, it's not something I've obviously followed the big leagues.
6904000	6907000	I've gotten a little bit, especially into the Japanese promotions as they've kind of gained
6907000	6909000	prominence in the last couple of years.
6909000	6915000	Uh, if anybody happens to know the name Joey Ryan, uh, the Pornhub sponsored indie wrestler,
6915000	6916000	Dead Serious.
6916000	6919000	And yes, he has a themed signature move.
6919000	6923000	I was going to suggest on Bobby's show that they sponsor E3 because you know, if we're
6923000	6928000	looking for a new sponsor for E3, it would make the show much more enjoyable.
6928000	6929000	Pornhub put on E3?
6929000	6930000	They would get into it.
6930000	6931000	Oh my God.
6931000	6932000	They would absolutely get into it.
6932000	6933000	So many people would go.
6933000	6934000	Anyway.
6934000	6935000	Um, Joey Ryan.
6935000	6938000	CES is always the same time as the Adult Film Expo in Las Vegas.
6938000	6939000	So, you know, why not?
6939000	6940000	Is that the case?
6940000	6941000	Yeah.
6941000	6942000	I feel like one was January, one was February.
6942000	6943000	No, they're both January.
6943000	6944000	Well, I don't know.
6944000	6947000	One may have moved recently, but for a while they were around the same time.
6947000	6948000	Anyway.
6948000	6953000	Uh, Joey Ryan has, I don't know officially what he calls it, uh, come to think of it,
6953000	6959000	but, um, his competitor will ultimately wind up grabbing his dick and get suplexed with
6959000	6962000	it.
6962000	6965000	Woo.
6965000	6967000	He is the Pornhub sponsored wrestler.
6967000	6969000	He has a glorious porn stash.
6969000	6971000	He oils himself up in the ring.
6971000	6976000	He is, um, a character in the best possible ways of wrestling.
6976000	6977000	Okay.
6977000	6980000	So I just want to preface, I'm allowed to say this.
6980000	6982000	This is really gay.
6982000	6984000	Like what you're talking about.
6984000	6988000	I mean, it's men running around in their underwear, slamming people down to the floor.
6988000	6989000	So I just want to be clear.
6989000	6993000	We've come to, us fans have come to accept this.
6993000	6998000	You know, Dick's suplexes are something straight out of orgasm, which that is something that
6998000	7001000	needs a sequel, but you know, we're never going to get that.
7001000	7005000	We're going to Broadway play of that with a splash zone.
7005000	7006000	How about video?
7006000	7007000	Okay.
7007000	7012000	Look, I gotta bring, I gotta bring it back from Dick's suplexing to happily, uh, what
7012000	7014000	do you, you've been playing anything lately?
7014000	7020000	Um, in my abundance of free time, considering that every Thursday with two prior days of
7020000	7024000	the week of set up and then once a month, Thursday, Friday, Saturday again, and Sunday
7024000	7025000	next month.
7025000	7031000	And yeah, um, the, the, the cliff notes of the fun, exciting things is that I finally
7031000	7034000	got it, got around to playing Red Dead Redemption one.
7034000	7038000	Um, I finished that with 15 minutes left to go in 2018.
7038000	7043000	Um, I was starting between a friend, let me borrow Breath of the Wild.
7043000	7046000	And so I was kind of alternating Breath of the Wild and Red Dead Redemption two.
7047000	7050000	And then I just went all in on Red Dead or on Breath of the Wild.
7050000	7054000	I'm still working on that to this day, just kind of exploring the entirety of the universe.
7054000	7057000	I have all the divine beasts beaten and just having fun with everything.
7057000	7059000	There's a lot to explore, especially with the DLC.
7059000	7065000	And the hero path mode is like, uh, I, so when I, when a friend borrowed it, obviously
7065000	7066000	he let me have the cartridge.
7066000	7070000	Um, and then I wound up saying, yeah, I'm enjoying this and just buying it and I just
7070000	7072000	returned the cartridge from the other day.
7072000	7074000	But I did that with all the DLC and everything else.
7074000	7077000	And so now I have the ability to actually see everywhere I went and I'm like, and I
7077000	7080000	don't have to, was I in this part of the city?
7080000	7082000	Did I go to this forest?
7082000	7083000	This swamp?
7083000	7084000	This...
7084000	7086000	Do you do some of the VR stuff too?
7086000	7088000	I do not currently have VR.
7088000	7089000	I want it.
7089000	7093000	Um, there's a, there's a couple of VR installations in the Denver area of places that you can
7093000	7097000	go pay a, you know, a couple bucks for 30 minutes, half an, uh, 30 minutes is half an
7097000	7099000	hour, 30 minutes, hour, what have you.
7099000	7101000	Um, so I've, I've played a couple, I've seen a whole bunch.
7101000	7104000	Uh, I'm, I'm aware of it, but I don't personally have it in home yet.
7104000	7107000	I thought for some reason, did you have like Oculus at one point?
7107000	7111000	I played around with an Oculus at work and a previous previous employer.
7111000	7112000	Maybe that's what it is.
7112000	7119000	Um, the, uh, so yeah, that basically has been my year is been breath of the wild, very large.
7119000	7120000	A couple of things.
7120000	7123000	Ace combat seven came out and I fucking marched through that game and I enjoyed it.
7123000	7125000	Uh, really, really good.
7125000	7128000	OST I love, I love, I love
7128000	7134000	A lot about series on gaming podcasts and mainstream stuff, but obviously, and you know,
7134000	7137000	um, Zaku calls in once in a while and he talks about flight SIM games.
7137000	7141000	I don't know if Ace combat's really flight SIM, but certainly they close, close enough,
7141000	7144000	but more arcadey, which appeals a lot more to me.
7144000	7150000	Would it be accurate to say it's kind of like how, um, Gran Turismo is a driving SIM.
7150000	7156000	And so like you have a flight SIM, but then you have like, um, uh, initial D is more like
7156000	7157000	an arcadey racer.
7157000	7160000	And so split his combat, split the difference and call it burnout.
7160000	7161000	Okay.
7161000	7162000	Okay.
7162000	7163000	Yeah.
7163000	7165000	Burnout or what's, what's the new one they made dangerous driving, which I still have
7165000	7166000	to play that.
7166000	7167000	Yeah.
7167000	7172000	A lot of fun, little destruction, car racing offshoots in the last while I missed out entirely
7172000	7174000	on quest buster knows exactly this ACE combat series.
7174000	7177000	ACE combat definitely leans more towards being an arcade SIM.
7177000	7179000	Think of it as Daytona, but in the sky with missiles.
7179000	7180000	Yeah.
7180000	7182000	Well, as long as it has a rad song, I still, Oh man.
7182000	7193000	Um, I haven't listened to it in ages, but, um, other than that, I spend, uh, way too
7193000	7195000	much money and time at round one.
7195000	7201000	Cause we had, we've had one back home since 2017, but they're finally going to open the
7201000	7202000	one here in a couple of months.
7202000	7206000	Uh, it says 2020 now on the sign.
7206000	7209000	That's only fricking six, seven months away.
7210000	7211000	What are you guys worried about?
7211000	7214000	Cause you guys haven't been fortunate enough with Bahmani for the last fricking 15 years
7214000	7215000	or anything.
7215000	7216000	We still have to drive a little bit.
7216000	7220000	I mean, Oh, a little bit over to RV GL.
7220000	7226000	Oh, I thought you meant like, like, uh, well, and there was that too.
7226000	7228000	I, I remember when it was completely.
7228000	7233000	Is there a good, I don't know there's music games, RV GL, not anymore, but there was a
7233000	7234000	spotter for a while.
7234000	7235000	Really?
7235000	7236000	That was like two years ago.
7236000	7238000	But I was saying, um, you're thinking Scandia, I think.
7238000	7239000	Oh yeah, I am.
7239000	7244000	But anyway, uh, I just, I miss those days when it was like Friday after work, it's like,
7244000	7247000	Hey, let's be stupid and get in the car and go to arcade infinity.
7247000	7249000	We'll stay the night at motel six.
7249000	7250000	All right.
7250000	7251000	Yeah.
7251000	7255000	And then just, that was very informative for me in my teenage years.
7255000	7259000	Same when we fricking met, made this show and people were talking about distant worlds
7259000	7261000	cause it came through town just the other day.
7261000	7262000	I brought this up on the show.
7262000	7263000	Not that long ago.
7263000	7264000	I mentioned we went to that con.
7264000	7266000	That was my first, dear friends.
7266000	7267000	You were 18.
7267000	7268000	I was 18.
7268000	7269000	Oh my God.
7269000	7271000	How old are you now?
7271000	7276000	Yeah, I was 18 cause it was June, 2004 so I hadn't turned 19 yet.
7276000	7277000	How old are you now?
7277000	7278000	Uh, 33.
7278000	7279000	I will be 34 in two months.
7279000	7280000	Oh my God.
7280000	7282000	I know I'm the baby here.
7282000	7283000	Yeah.
7283000	7284000	My round one is fricking awesome.
7284000	7290000	They got dance rush a while ago and because it is a Japanese arcade, they continue to
7291000	7297000	get content updates, which is huge, huge in the modern, in the modern, uh, trend of Bimani
7297000	7298000	gaming.
7298000	7305000	Um, so a song, um, there's a pair of Swedish, I assume some European producers cause fricking
7305000	7313000	everybody electro is, is in Sweden, Norway, Europe, um, uh, named W and W that have some
7313000	7315000	big room electro songs that I really like.
7315000	7325000	And the dance rush content update has a song of W and W featuring Kitsune AI called the
7325000	7326000	light.
7326000	7329000	And I am hopelessly addicted to that song right now.
7329000	7330000	I have to listen to that.
7330000	7336000	Dance rush has a very small library, all things told, but it is the vast majority of it all
7336000	7337000	original.
7337000	7338000	It has some super good gyms.
7338000	7341000	The first versions of a game often do all of what?
7341000	7343000	Nine songs on DDR first or seven, six or seven.
7343000	7344000	I was like six or seven.
7344000	7345000	Yep.
7345000	7346000	Anyway.
7346000	7347000	All right.
7347000	7348000	Well, good catching up.
7348000	7351000	We should get back into our show role though, but, uh, always a, always a delight to have
7351000	7352000	you here on the show.
7352000	7356000	So you're, we're literally a stop for you on the way to the Bay area for your, your
7356000	7358000	all hands meeting, which was described in our chat.
7358000	7359000	What that means.
7359000	7361000	Cause when you have a lot of remote employees, you bring them all in once a year.
7361000	7364000	We have over, over half of the company is remote.
7364000	7368000	And while we communicate as well as we can there, it's always helpful to get people in
7369000	7373000	person on the same page, high bandwidth to have all of these water cooler conversations
7373000	7376000	and all these sorts of things that you can't do being remote.
7376000	7377000	And you don't, and you don't fly.
7377000	7378000	I do not fly.
7378000	7382000	So that's, that's why I was stuck in a, some kind of an animal incident up in Auburn.
7382000	7384000	That's why I wound up being later.
7384000	7385000	Everything.
7385000	7389000	There were like 10 or 11 emergency and service vehicles that cut through us up in Auburn.
7389000	7391000	You missed the crap that was going on down here earlier.
7391000	7394000	I think Waze was still using it cause I realized it didn't even have me.
7394000	7396000	It didn't even have me taking 50 anything like that.
7396000	7398000	Just got close and then just south all the way down here.
7398000	7399000	Did you leave Colorado this morning?
7399000	7402000	Uh, 7 PM yesterday.
7402000	7404000	Have you slept?
7404000	7406000	Two or three or four hours or something.
7406000	7409000	I nap on the way because charging takes a while.
7409000	7410000	Wow.
7410000	7411000	Wow.
7411000	7412000	Oh my gosh.
7412000	7415000	I'm feeling surprisingly good right now considering all of that.
7415000	7417000	You must be going to say what, you want coffee?
7417000	7421000	Bear in mind also the fact that I fell asleep before the end of the show last year when I did this.
7421000	7424000	So there's a very good chance, especially me on camera, I'll be like.
7424000	7428000	If you need to go sit in that comfy chair, put the mic down on the pillow if you're going to go to sleep.
7428000	7429000	All right.
7429000	7430000	Well anyway.
7430000	7432000	You'll just hear a boom.
7432000	7433000	Let's move on.
7433000	7435000	We got, we got some more video game news to cover.
7435000	7440000	It's great catching up Jason, but we do want to get, I mean, we didn't have a lot of emails tonight anyway, so it was good to use that time.
7440000	7444000	Do I catch up a little bit and talk about what's going on, but I think we got some more gaming news to cover.
7444000	7450000	So, uh, Loki, why don't we get back into it here and then we'll of course invite you guys to participate with us tonight as well.
7451000	7454000	Via Discord over at vognetwork.com slash Discord.
7454000	7457000	S2100 Matt says your third wind is kicking in.
7457000	7458000	Yeah.
7458000	7459000	Probably accurate right now.
7459000	7460000	Probably.
7460000	7461000	All right.
7461000	7462000	All right.
7462000	7467000	So apparently there's a video that's out there that's showing somebody running an Xbox emulator on the switch.
7467000	7479000	Uh, they're doing this with, um, apparently the L4, L4T Linux is running out and then they're running the, uh, XQMU Xbox emulator in there.
7479000	7482000	And of course it doesn't run great yet.
7482000	7487000	Um, the video is actually showing them running at about four, four times the speed.
7487000	7497000	And, uh, they've got, looks like, um, Jet Set Future on there and Halo I think was being shown as well.
7497000	7506000	Um, but it's running really slow, obviously, but neat that they're able to actually do something like this.
7506000	7509000	And apparently they're controlling right now with the PlayStation 4 controller.
7509000	7516000	So it's kind of amazing that you have, you know, an Nintendo system running an Xbox game using a PlayStation 4 controller.
7516000	7518000	So that's kind of crazy, but.
7518000	7520000	Hooray for Homebrew.
7520000	7522000	I kind of live for that kind of irony though.
7522000	7525000	You got to, I, I, I do love it only, only in hacker culture.
7525000	7534000	And then throw in a dash of a week or two story of the, the Ruby, uh, executor environment in the last week or two that I remember seeing in the show roll.
7534000	7535000	Yeah.
7535000	7543000	Well, you know, do you think this is going to add fuel to the, uh, Microsoft and Nintendo are getting in bed together at E3 rumors?
7543000	7545000	Well, I don't know about that.
7545000	7552000	I know this is all unofficial, obviously that's important, but it kind of shows that, well, if they want to run Microsoft stuff on the Switch, they probably could.
7552000	7555000	Well, not natively, I would think.
7555000	7556000	That's true.
7556000	7562000	All right, well, moving on to talk about something that is pretty exciting as far as accessibility is concerned over in the Microsoft world.
7563000	7570000	Uh, Microsoft has recently submitted a patent that shows that there is a braille accessory coming for their Xbox controller.
7570000	7578000	Um, not that every patent always necessarily becomes an actual product, but it certainly has a lot of people thinking, wouldn't it be neat if it could?
7578000	7586000	Uh, and Microsoft has certainly listened to a lot of calls out there for accessibility and adding that to their system, especially the adaptive controller.
7586000	7588000	A lot of people have been talking about that recently, right?
7588000	7599000	Um, so this new patent submission shows braille, and it's haptic braille support, so I guess that means it's kind of using the little taps like you might have on some of the newer phones, uh, to kind of feel a little bit more like braille.
7599000	7610000	And it looks like the way it is on the controller, it's kind of on the back, so like you might be holding the controller and then as your hands are kind of on the back of the controller, it might be actually tapping the braille, uh, that you want to read there in the back.
7610000	7611000	So that's kind of neat.
7611000	7624000	What's interesting about that picture, as far as I remember braille, characters are never more than four dots high, although it's interesting that that one only has three, and then the two columns left and right.
7624000	7628000	I think it's always a six dot configuration for braille. I think.
7628000	7633000	Doesn't sound right to me, but I also don't know braille, so.
7634000	7648000	Um, let's see, so also in the patent it talks about, although the gaming industry has made some progress towards improving a game's general accessibility, a need remains for improved game controllers and accessories that address the very specialized manner in which visually impaired or blind users interact with video games.
7648000	7660000	Uh, and so they talked about that the controller would have various adaptations that provide alternative input and outputs to facilitate gameplay by sight impaired or blind users, as well as other users' knowledge of braille.
7660000	7669000	And I think what's most important about this whole, and I'm obviously I'm saying this very tongue in cheek, y'all, because I don't want to lessen the, the amazing news that this is.
7669000	7677000	But I do notice in the patent, the game that is being played has some sort of cat on the stream and it says, want to play?
7678000	7684000	So it's like a cat simulator game, I guess, and I would assume that want to play is what's coming through in the braille.
7684000	7695000	For an input like that, you basically do have to re-explore how information is conceived entirely, so that's probably like Tamagotchi-esque, like something very simple call and response.
7695000	7699000	This is your status information about your virtual pet that you need to take care of.
7700000	7703000	So, I mean, I can sit here and go, wow, that's neat.
7703000	7707000	You know, we need more accessibility options for folks, but I would really love to.
7707000	7716000	And I know we have a couple of folks out there who are blind or other otherwise visually impaired who listen to the show since, you know, it's been a podcast for years and years.
7716000	7720000	I would so love to hear what your guys' thoughts are on this.
7720000	7725000	Like, if this is something that you think is really going to impact you, I would really love to hear your thoughts on this.
7725000	7730000	And, you know, again, we don't have confirmation for Microsoft that this is coming, and I think we don't want to get our hopes up too much.
7730000	7733000	But it is really cool that at least they're thinking about it.
7733000	7738000	So, you know, and putting their feelers out there to possibly have something like that in the future.
7738000	7740000	So, as always, you can always send your e-mails.
7740000	7745000	Participate at OrangeLawnTrader.com or your tweets over at O-L-R.
7745000	7750000	So, yeah, and ACTF says Microsoft is really cool with all the accessibility stuff.
7750000	7752000	So, and Bobby.
7752000	7753000	Eight.
7753000	7754000	Huh?
7754000	7756000	Oh, you saw the question from Bobby?
7756000	7759000	Yep. I'm staring at it. Had to mental map it.
7759000	7762000	One didn't know how many superchargers on the way here.
7762000	7773000	Like I said, considering that all of the meaningful charging, especially across the wide sprawl of the open western U.S., you get longer charge times at each of those.
7773000	7778000	So, 30-plus minutes and just kind of knock out, wake up, unplug, get to it again.
7778000	7782000	Okay. Wow. I'd be so dead tired. But anyways. But, you know.
7782000	7785000	I'm so dead tired. But I'm here and it's happy and I'm settled.
7785000	7787000	That's right. We are happy to have you.
7787000	7789000	All right. Moving on. Loki, what do you have for us?
7789000	7794000	All right. So, Nintendo has apparently shut down their anti-piracy website.
7794000	7795000	So, it looks like last time.
7795000	7797000	Which means piracy for everybody.
7797000	7800000	Yes. That means it's open season for piracy, apparently.
7800000	7801000	Obviously, it is very much.
7801000	7805000	I like how the website, though, had like an angry face Mario on there. Like, he's very annoyed.
7805000	7806000	Like, how dare you?
7806000	7809000	Love ROMs is gone. We win. It's over.
7809000	7811000	How dare you do that?
7812000	7815000	But, yeah. So, no word on what exactly it means. All that we know.
7815000	7820000	The angry face was specifically in response to the Commodore 64 port. Specifically.
7820000	7823000	Yeah. So, originally, the site was ap.nintendo.com.
7823000	7827000	But now just redirects to nintendo.com. So.
7827000	7830000	Oh, well. Guess it's piracy season now.
7830000	7834000	I think maybe it was more. It probably just wasn't getting a lot of traffic.
7834000	7838000	And they kind of realized maybe the time it would spend to update that site.
7838000	7843000	Well, it looks like, yeah, the last few updates, press release updates, were like from over a year ago.
7843000	7845000	So.
7845000	7849000	The key thing is that Reggie was actually running that whole site himself.
7849000	7854000	So, when he left, it was done for. That's what really happened, honestly.
7854000	7856000	No, I'm just, I'm obviously making that up.
7856000	7858000	Anyway.
7858000	7860000	Let's move on and talk a little bit about.
7860000	7864000	Oh, this was interesting because this was put in our Discord server this week.
7864000	7866000	And I thought it was an interesting story.
7866000	7869000	So, I wanted to talk a little bit about this which has to do with EA.
7869000	7876000	And talking about how the way that they've been releasing games may not be the way they're going to do that anymore.
7876000	7878000	Because they're stupid?
7878000	7881000	Well, here's the thing. I kind of think they're missing the obvious issues.
7881000	7883000	But let's talk about it.
7883000	7885000	So, they had their financial results call.
7885000	7891000	So, that's a thing that the companies usually do is they have to answer to their stockholders because they are, you know, publicly traded companies.
7891000	7896000	So, they had to talk about Anthem and how it didn't live up to expectations.
7896000	7900000	But EA did reaffirm support for the game and for BioWare.
7900000	7903000	So, they didn't come out on the call and say, we're closing BioWare next month.
7903000	7905000	Which is a good thing. We don't want them.
7905000	7908000	We don't want as much shit as we've given Anthem. We don't want to see that happen.
7908000	7911000	Unlike every other studio in BioWare, anyways.
7911000	7913000	It was some of the other interesting comments here.
7913000	7918000	CEO Andrew Wilson said during the call, the reality is it's not just an EA challenge.
7918000	7920000	It's an industry-wide challenge.
7920000	7926000	You're moving from what was initially a BioWare game, which would be somewhere between 40 and 80 hours of offline play,
7926000	7935000	to 40 to 80 hours of offline play plus 100 or 200, 300 hours of elder game that happens with millions of other players at scale online.
7935000	7941000	So, we're kind of talking about that always online and end game and all that stuff.
7941000	7946000	As games have gotten bigger, that system isn't working as well as it has been done in years gone by.
7946000	7951000	So, what you should expect from us is that it's not just about changing the development processes in the game.
7951000	7954000	It's not just about changing the QA processes in the game.
7954000	7958000	Although both those things are being changed dramatically inside our organization right now.
7958000	7961000	But it also comes down to changing how we launch games.
7961000	7965000	You should expect that we'll start to test things like soft launches.
7965000	7967000	The same things that you see in the mobile space right now.
7967000	7971000	And it also comes down to changing how we communicate with players.
7971000	7977000	Our entire marketing organization now is moving out of presentation mode and into conversation mode.
7977000	7979000	And changing how we interact with players over time.
7979000	7982000	See, I do think there's some good things in there. I do.
7982000	7987000	I do think the fact that he says conversation versus presentation, I think that's important.
7987000	7992000	Because that's showing that you're starting to realize that your fan base isn't stupid.
7992000	7996000	Yeah, it seems like they're taking some good steps towards writing everything.
7996000	8000000	But then I remembered it's EA, so nothing's gonna fucking change.
8000000	8003000	Well, we'll see. We'll see.
8003000	8006000	But I want to continue on here.
8006000	8008000	We think that we're in a really good position for this.
8008000	8010000	I think it gets really hard if you don't have scale to do this.
8010000	8012000	And so we feel very good about it.
8012000	8018000	And over time we hope that we can lead from the front and help other developers and publishers change the way they do things as well.
8018000	8024000	I get a little nervous about EA talking about leading the pack when I feel like in many ways they're struggling right now.
8024000	8026000	Versus some of these other...
8027000	8031000	You talk about, oh, the mobile games are doing the launches more correctly, which I'm not really sure what that means.
8031000	8033000	A soft launch for mobile games?
8033000	8037000	Obviously I think about big launches like Pokemon Go and how that actually kind of...
8037000	8040000	In the beginning it struggled a little bit with the server issues.
8040000	8043000	Then it was the biggest fucking thing video gaming had seen in ten years.
8043000	8047000	I know it's a crazy idea, but how about we just release the game when it's done?
8047000	8049000	That would certainly be...
8049000	8051000	Also, with the soft launch, I also kind of feel like...
8051000	8056000	Isn't that also kind of where Anthem shot itself in the foot and where Mass Effect Andromeda shot itself in the foot?
8056000	8062000	By coming out a little early on those EA Access platforms, all the warts were on full display.
8062000	8066000	Yeah, and you know why though? Because EA needs the extra money.
8066000	8074000	You see, they don't really have to offer that type of service on EA Access, but that's what makes EA Access a little bit more appealing to certain people.
8074000	8078000	But they want the extra money so they don't give a shit.
8078000	8085000	Oh, by the way, since you brought it up, EA Access is going to be coming to the PlayStation 4 finally in July for $30 a year,
8085000	8088000	which is the same as what they're charging on Xbox One.
8088000	8095000	We don't know exactly what titles are on it, but we would just assume that there's going to be a lot of parallels to the Xbox One version of the service,
8095000	8097000	where this has existed for a while.
8097000	8103000	And they even mentioned that along with the back catalog of EA titles that's available in these games,
8103000	8111000	you also get the Play First Trials, hence what we saw Anthem and some of these other games that I'm not sure went so well for EA.
8111000	8117000	So I think it's important that they kind of talk a little more, I think, what maybe a soft launch means to them. I'm not sure.
8117000	8118000	Beta test first.
8118000	8126000	Well, act deft in our chat over at twitch.tv slash vlog network says, basically, we're going to launch games in beta phase and let the consumer be our beta testers.
8126000	8128000	Maybe that's what they're saying. I don't know.
8128000	8137000	Well, it's because also, you know, these platforms, I think, also have the ability now to do this kind of early access bullshit where they actually label these games early access.
8137000	8143000	So they release some unfinished as they do now, but just, you know, calling the unfinished.
8143000	8150000	Questbuster in chat says this might be me, but it sounds a lot like EA's throwing a lot of smoke and mirrors and answering the question on Anthem,
8150000	8156000	because games that follow a similar pattern like the Division 2 and Monster Hunter World didn't seem to have that issue.
8156000	8157000	Good call out.
8157000	8162000	Anthem clearly had issues, and the caller was asking about the issues of perception that were connected to Anthem.
8162000	8169000	So it is interesting. I kind of like the way you phrased that, Questbuster, because it kind of makes it sound like the CEO kind of had his canned response ready to go,
8169000	8174000	knowing that he'd kind of be called out, and it's like he had to get this canned response.
8174000	8176000	He had to get that out at some point.
8176000	8180000	I mean, I hate to make a Drag Race reference, but I'm going to.
8180000	8187000	It's like sometimes Queens flounder in the Snatch Game, like Evie Oddly did, because they have certain things they have to get out,
8187000	8194000	and so they'll put it out there when maybe it doesn't necessarily make sense in connection with the joke.
8194000	8199000	That happens sometimes with these CEOs and so forth, so it was like he wanted to respond to this,
8199000	8205000	and so maybe he took this question and kind of gave this completely out of the blue answer to kind of explain why.
8205000	8211000	Well, we see it as a problem with the industry as a whole. It's not really Anthem's problem. It's the industry's problem.
8211000	8214000	It's like we had to get that blame out there at some point.
8214000	8221000	I made that point years ago on this show. I don't even remember when. It was easily three to four years.
8221000	8226000	And it was an easy prediction because of the capabilities that Xbox Live really spearheaded,
8226000	8233000	and we now see on every single system, Switch included, that, yeah, subscription updates, all of this stuff.
8233000	8239000	No game is ever finished. Ever. There's always something that wasn't accounted for.
8239000	8244000	There's always something that they had to scrap for time reasons, and they revisited and resolved.
8244000	8249000	Or sometimes it's fun to revisit things. World of Goo just got that update like ten years later, right?
8249000	8251000	We talked about that on last week's show.
8251000	8257000	I actually overlooked that news. But yeah, I remember playing World of Goo in frickin' 05.
8257000	8261000	That'd be more than ten years. I wonder if that year is actually accurate.
8261000	8264000	But I remember how, yeah, I realize how old that game is.
8264000	8272000	It's not, with the proliferation of services, with the adoption of subscriptions,
8272000	8278000	with the rising capabilities of what we have in our living rooms, on our computers, everything else now,
8278000	8286000	it's not a surprise that in a grab for time and attention,
8286000	8292000	that they're going to make something with more replayability, the entropy of other individuals,
8292000	8296000	and stick you in a world with other people and let you make your own destiny,
8296000	8303000	because people like making their own decisions in as much as a game allows them to.
8303000	8306000	It's not a surprise that we find ourselves here now.
8306000	8313000	And so there's truth to what he said in broad strokes. I actually paid no attention to Anthem.
8313000	8315000	And I'm not completely dogging on what he's saying.
8315000	8321000	Like I said, there's some pieces in there that I do think are relatively woke for a CEO.
8321000	8326000	You know, all of these, like the whole, we need to change the way we're marketing games.
8326000	8330000	Yes, you do. That's a great place to start. Let's start there.
8330000	8335000	So, you know, we'll see what develops. E3 is going to be very interesting.
8335000	8341000	EA will have a chance to show how they're going to sell games in the future with what they're doing in LA during E3 week.
8341000	8344000	Even if they're not participating in the game direct or in the show directly,
8344000	8348000	they've got their own parallel thing going on and games that they're going to be showing for this year.
8348000	8351000	It will be very interesting to see how that message is relayed.
8351000	8354000	So speaking of grabbing for content, grabbing for attention from gamers,
8354000	8358000	like there's only so many people they can cram into a physical space.
8358000	8361000	But if they have the venue, they create the rules for everything they want to do.
8361000	8363000	That's right. All right. Let's move on.
8363000	8367000	Just a couple more stories before we open it up to potentially anybody that wants to call in on our discord.
8367000	8370000	So vog network dot com slash discord. But before we get there, Loki.
8370000	8376000	So there was an estate sale for someone that was a former employee of Dick Animation City,
8376000	8379000	who did a lot of what did you call that?
8379000	8382000	I'm just kidding. Yeah, that's what they know.
8382000	8384000	I remember that I never had a little animation.
8384000	8392000	Yes. So they did lots of like your favorite cartoons like Inspector Gadget, the real Ghostbusters, you know, the Super Mario Brothers Super Show type stuff.
8392000	8396000	So they're a part of the Super Mario Brothers Power Hour.
8396000	8404000	They had several different concepts that never really made it into actual cartoons, but they had promo art for.
8404000	8407000	And these were actually sold during that estate sale.
8407000	8412000	So some of the things that we see here, there is going to be an adaption for Double Dragon,
8412000	8415000	which was actually looks a little bit better than what actually came out.
8415000	8421000	They were going to do California games, which looks a lot of a stretch.
8421000	8429000	Castlevania, which looks goddamn terrible, has nothing to do with Castlevania and more to do with like monsters and some kids.
8429000	8433000	I was I was just going to say.
8433000	8436000	That reminds me of zombies ate my neighbors more than. Yeah.
8436000	8442000	And then Metroid with a male Samus Aran.
8442000	8445000	What is Jake? Jake Space Man.
8445000	8453000	Somebody clearly did not play the game when they designed the cartoon or they were about to make a very, very, very poor decision.
8453000	8457000	Can you imagine if they tried to just suddenly make Sam comment?
8457000	8468000	That was just but that was like such an epic ending of a game to find out that, you know, this bad ass, you know, I kind of broke the trope and it made the bad ass hero a female, which is which is a great thing.
8468000	8473000	So I just like the fact that somebody would have the audacity to change it to a dude.
8473000	8483000	I would like to think it comes from a place of complete ignorance about the game and what they're really doing, which, you know, was the norm when it came to Hollywood and video games for a very long time.
8483000	8490000	And, you know, funny that we're sitting here this week talking about Detective Pikachu and how Detective Pikachu kind of got a lot of things right.
8490000	8498000	But because I bet a lot of the people that made Detective Pikachu probably grew up on Pokemon in a very different place now.
8498000	8505000	And there was a lot of, you know, the the lore or what have you that was respected as opposed to changing things for the sake of change.
8505000	8511000	So Quest Buster in chat says, I, too, am hoping that the version of Metroid came from a place of complete ignorance.
8511000	8514000	I, I would honestly bet money it did.
8514000	8517000	It was probably just an idea to like pitch stuff to Nintendo.
8517000	8519000	I'm sure that they, you know, denied.
8519000	8524000	Metroid probably looked at that. I'm sorry. Nintendo probably looked at that Metroid thing and went, how about no.
8524000	8527000	Metroid and the secret of the ooze.
8527000	8531000	Given that, that, that boogery oozy typeface.
8531000	8533000	Is that Ridley or something? I don't know. Anyway.
8533000	8535000	I think it's just one of the Chozo type, I don't know.
8535000	8539000	Orange Wright does point out that the Double Dragon one looks better than the cartoon that actually came out for that.
8539000	8544000	That one looks authentic. California Games isn't terrible. I don't like the characters are nondescript.
8545000	8551000	Considering that California Games doesn't exactly have a huge lore behind it, I guess that would be a hard one to fuck up.
8551000	8553000	Dude's on the beach, bro.
8553000	8557000	That's what, it would be a totally like 90s, like everybody talking like the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.
8557000	8559000	But real people.
8559000	8561000	It would be like American Gladiator season one and Malibu.
8561000	8568000	Double Dragon does look pretty awesome. Like I would have preferred that to anything Double Dragon we've received so far.
8569000	8575000	Alright. Well, one more story for you guys and it has to do with another classic.
8575000	8578000	And funny enough, it's a classic we just talked about last week.
8578000	8582000	When Bobby gave us that little guest spot in the middle of our show last week.
8582000	8586000	Showing you Dragon's Lair that was ported to the TI 99 4A.
8586000	8590000	Well, that's not the only port of Dragon's Lair that we're talking about this month.
8590000	8594000	Because Dragon's Lair the trilogy is coming to the Xbox One.
8594000	8598000	That's right. And honestly, my first reaction was it wasn't already there.
8598000	8601000	But no, apparently it is not.
8601000	8604000	Dragon's Lair, Dragon's Lair 2, Time Warp.
8604000	8607000	And you might be wondering, there was a third Dragon's Lair game?
8607000	8609000	No, but there was Space Ace.
8609000	8614000	And it usually gets looped in with the Dragon's Lair games because they were all Don Bluth animated games after all.
8614000	8616000	Well, it's Brain Dev 13.
8616000	8619000	Thank you. Yes, it was on PC compendiums.
8619000	8622000	And I'm so sad that they are not bringing that.
8622000	8625000	I used to really like the characters in there.
8625000	8628000	Is it a different publisher that ultimately put out those games?
8628000	8632000	I don't know. I haven't played it since the mid-late 90s.
8632000	8637000	I think it was. But anyway, the games have been remastered and updated for modern audiences.
8637000	8641000	God, did they re-run it in 4K? I don't know.
8641000	8647000	But anyway, considering they're all hand drawn, it does still look really good.
8647000	8649000	I'm actually not dogging this whatsoever.
8649000	8652000	It's just kind of one of those, like, okay, here we go.
8652000	8655000	I thought we already had Dragon's Lair on every platform possible.
8655000	8658000	And then last week it was, nope, not the TI 99 4A.
8658000	8662000	And then it's, okay, that's funny because that was from the 80s and that takes a lot of work.
8662000	8666000	And now it's like, oh no, they don't have all the new ones taken care of either.
8666000	8668000	So I think it's pretty cool.
8668000	8672000	Now, I would love it if they would bring back some of the other ports of these games.
8672000	8676000	There was a Commodore 64 port of these games. It was completely unlike the arcade games.
8676000	8679000	I mean, it had some of the scenes inspired from the arcade.
8679000	8683000	But the chiptune music in Dragon's Lair was so fucking good.
8683000	8685000	I really can't overstate it.
8685000	8690000	Anyway, Dragon's Lair trilogy will be out on Xbox One on May 17th.
8690000	8692000	And I love this.
8692000	8695000	Would you like the current list of platforms that Dragon's Lair is available on?
8695000	8697000	Yes, you do.
8697000	8705000	Dragon's Lair, currently available on PC, Atari ST, Halcyon, Laser Interactive, Mega CD, Jaguar CD, 3DO, DVD,
8705000	8710000	Blu-ray, CD-i, NES, SNES, Game Boy Color, PS3, Nintendo Switch, Nintendo Wii, ZX Spectrum,
8710000	8715000	Commodore 64, Amstrad, CPC, 464, Nintendo DSi, and iOS and Android devices.
8715000	8718000	They left off TI-99-4A. I'm going to send an angry email.
8718000	8720000	NES?
8720000	8723000	Well, here's the thing. The NES and Commodore 64 is in there too.
8723000	8726000	They weren't exactly direct ports of the arcade game.
8726000	8730000	Yeah, I know that was a dramatic down sample that the SNES version did.
8730000	8732000	But I didn't know anything proficient in that.
8732000	8737000	Brandon 13 did get ported over to iOS, so it's on mobile on the Apple side of the house.
8737000	8741000	But that was in 2010, so who knows if that actually...
8741000	8748000	Yeah, it says December 1st of 2010, they added support for iOS 3 and 4.2.
8748000	8751000	So most likely it doesn't work anymore and it's probably not.
8751000	8754000	That's beyond so many architectural barriers.
8754000	8758000	Oh, it might be shut out on that whole 32-bit to 64-bit thing. I don't know.
8758000	8762000	And it's not even iOS 4 compatible. It won't even have that tag on its page.
8762000	8767000	Bobby Blackwell says the Dragon's Lair on the NES and SNES was a side-scrolling platformer.
8767000	8768000	Yeah, I vaguely remember this.
8768000	8773000	Like the Commodore 64 one, I remember the very first sequence was on a falling platform
8773000	8775000	and there was wind that was trying to blow you off the platform.
8775000	8780000	So it wasn't like the arcade game. You had to run in the opposite direction of the wind.
8780000	8783000	And it was really hard. Those games were fucking hard.
8783000	8785000	But anyway.
8785000	8787000	Yeah, Dartusius says NES Dragon's Lair was awful.
8787000	8793000	But these are going to be ports of the straight-up arcade version because it's very easy.
8793000	8794000	The animation, the reference version.
8794000	8797000	It's very easy to port that now with Blu-ray.
8797000	8800000	Let's play a movie and drop in input checkmarks.
8800000	8805000	I love that that type of stuff is fully playable on DVD and Blu-ray players.
8805000	8807000	It's kind of neat. Anyway.
8807000	8811000	Alright, we are going to open up our Discord channel for your calls.
8811000	8815000	So we're available right now over at vognetwork.com slash Discord.
8815000	8819000	Or if you want, you can ask us questions in chat. We're open there as well.
8819000	8822000	Our chat room, of course, at twitch.tv slash vognetwork.
8822000	8826000	If you have anything you want to talk about that we haven't got to yet tonight.
8826000	8828000	Did you have any last-minute stories?
8828000	8833000	Not much, but there's a neat video of somebody that's recreating Melger Solid in Dreams.
8833000	8835000	It's too bad I never did get into it.
8835000	8838000	When's Dreams come out already? I so want to check this out.
8838000	8839000	I don't know.
8839000	8843000	It's been in closed beta. Now it's not under NDA anymore.
8843000	8847000	This game is going to be talked to death before it ever comes out.
8847000	8849000	I really hope they get that out soon.
8851000	8853000	Sometime this year.
8853000	8854000	Okay.
8854000	8856000	It's coming out in 2019.
8856000	8860000	I was going to say maybe we'll get an update at E3, but at the same time I actually don't think we will.
8860000	8863000	Because Sony's not going to be there.
8863000	8867000	And this is from Media Molecules, essentially a Sony studio, right?
8867000	8868000	Yep. Yeah.
8868000	8873000	So I guess unless they put out a state of play around the same time or something else that they might have planned.
8873000	8875000	I don't know if we're going to see that.
8875000	8882000	Certainly exclusive enough. A little bit planned. It didn't exactly go much further than PS3, PS4, Vita, PSP.
8882000	8887000	So anyway, I think I do see somebody that just landed in our green room there, so let's bring them on the air.
8887000	8890000	Hello, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?
8890000	8893000	Hey, what's going on? It's Rama. How is everybody tonight?
8893000	8895000	Hey, we're doing good, Rama. How are you doing?
8895000	8901000	Good, good. I'm hoping now that I try and Discord on my desktop again, we won't run into any issues the first few times I've called in.
8901000	8904000	You sound just fine. What's on your mind tonight?
8904000	8910000	Cool. Let me ask you something. This is something that came up on my Twitter feed briefly last week.
8910000	8918000	And I just had this confused look on my face of what is wrong with this current generation of gamers.
8918000	8929000	Now, let me ask you. When it comes to spoilers, what is the general moratorium on how long you should wait before you talk about spoilers in the game?
8929000	8938000	I think you need to consider your audience is very important. Just consider who it is you're talking to and, you know, have they recently had an opportunity to see it yet?
8939000	8946000	It's kind of like, I guess with the Avengers, I guess even the directors came out and said, after this weekend, you can talk spoilers.
8946000	8954000	Because they knew they had that Spider-Man trailer that was going to come out that Monday that has a major spoiler for Endgame right in the first 30 seconds of the trailer.
8954000	8960000	So they, I guess, had their own reasons for doing that. But I think it just kind of depends on your audience.
8960000	8967000	I would say honestly, like, also, it depends on if the game takes a while to beat, but maybe like six weeks.
8967000	8975000	But I don't know if there is just a hard line. I think you just have to kind of like consider your audience and just be like, hey, have you played that game yet? No?
8975000	8983000	Okay, well, then I won't ruin it for you. But, you know, it's kind of like, I would bet that most of our audience probably saw Detective Pikachu this weekend.
8983000	8986000	But I think there's at least one or two who didn't. And so I don't want to ruin it for him.
8986000	9001000	I would love to talk spoilers, because there are some things I really want to say about it. But I'm just, I'm, my need to talk about it does not outweigh the rights of those who haven't seen it yet to be genuinely delighted like I was with some of the twists.
9001000	9014000	Okay, all right. And I totally get where you're coming from. And I understand that. Six weeks? Yeah, I can see that. Now, what about if the period's about, oh, 20 years?
9015000	9022000	That's, that's a little extreme. Because I think at this point, I mean, movies that are that old, we spoil left and right, you know?
9022000	9030000	Okay, guess what, everybody? Luke is Darth Vader's son. I get it right? I can't even remember.
9030000	9039000	You know, the sled was called Rosebud. Oh, my God. Right? Like, you know, those types of things, I think people kind of are a little more open about at this point.
9039000	9046000	Okay, so yeah, 20 years. That's a bit much. It's in some ways, it's kind of like, well, what were you waiting for? The plane came down safely, an airplane?
9046000	9052000	Is somebody mad because you talked about the Final Fantasy 7 trailer and was like, hey, Aerith dies?
9052000	9060000	Thank you. That's what I was going to. This was with a friend of mine. She was tweeting about the fact that there are people complaining about the death of Aerith.
9060000	9073000	And I'm just like, it's 20 years. But I get it to a certain extent, because years ago, I was part of like the big, one of the big Sailor Moon live journal groups dating myself here.
9073000	9086000	Hi. But I talked about the death of one of the Senshi Minako, and people were giving me crap for it. But I'm like, it's been six months since the show was on the air.
9086000	9096000	Also, I would argue sometimes it's not necessarily about the spoiler itself, like a big twist like that, that like Aerith dies, but about the journey that we take to get there.
9096000	9106000	And I think especially when it comes to the remake, we're all assuming she dies. Who's to say they're not going to take some massive...
9106000	9114000	And I know y'all are looking at me like I'm fucking crazy, but we've also made those same jokes at the same time about the DLC to keep her alive.
9114000	9120000	How do you know there won't be something to maybe bring her back later on as a response to a big fan movement or something like that?
9120000	9126000	We all assume we know how it's going to go down. How do we know she doesn't die in a different manner? Or they make subtle changes?
9126000	9138000	Look at a movie like A Star is Born, right? They have made that movie four times. There was the original in the 30s, there's the Judy Garland version, there's the Barbra Streisand version, and now there's the Lady Gaga version.
9138000	9148000	Essentially, that movie is pretty much the same plot. So I could tell you, I'm still going to be polite to those that maybe aren't aware that there is a big twist at the end of the movie.
9148000	9162000	I'm not going to say what happens, but it's kind of been that same twist in all four iterations of A Star is Born. However, how it goes down has been different every time and how the movie ultimately ends as a result.
9163000	9179000	Okay, that makes sense. Now, to put on the whole aspect of Aeris DLC, now if I remember correctly, when Final Fantasy VII did come to the US, there were some changes and basically, if you wanted to play as Aeris, you needed an action replay to do so.
9179000	9190000	Whereas I believe in the Japanese version, not so much. So I could see them pulling some type of plot twist where, oh, she is alive, but she ends up dying towards the end of the game or something like that.
9190000	9193000	I could see Square Enix being a bag of dicks doing that.
9193000	9203000	And by the way, I just want to point out, because our chat room is kind of talking about this and talking about Game of Thrones, which we all know is the same time as OLR, only one more week do I have to deal with the ratings drop because Game of Thrones.
9203000	9205000	The last season has been kind of, eh, anyway.
9205000	9209000	I heard last week's episode was not good, but people are still watching tonight for whatever reason.
9209000	9212000	I'm going to, it's two more episodes and then that's it.
9212000	9220000	But here's my point. Here's my point. I'm not knocking Game of Thrones. Those of you that are into it, cool. I think that's great. I'm really glad you're still here in spite of that being on right now.
9220000	9226000	But the chat room is completely right. People have no respect for Game of Thrones spoilers on social media.
9226000	9229000	And for me, it's RuPaul's Drag Race. It's the exact same thing.
9229000	9233000	I have been spoiled on every episode of RuPaul's Drag Race because of social media.
9233000	9237000	And people always say to me, like, well, why don't you just stay off social media then?
9237000	9242000	And I'm like, you know, like, kind of fuck you. I use social media for more than just RuPaul's Drag Race.
9242000	9248000	And like, it's like, I can't help the fact I live on the West Coast, so I can't watch it at the same time.
9248000	9257000	It's not on, I mean, I could find an internet piracy stream, but you know, it's just, you know, you go on social media, you're going to get spoiled.
9257000	9263000	But does it ruin Drag Race? Does it ruin Game of Thrones if you find out that, well, I don't even want to say.
9263000	9273000	Like, there's a massive spoiler in the first season, and somebody who's known for dying a lot dies again in the first season.
9273000	9279000	Most people generally know that by now. I'm sorry if I ruined it for you, but if you haven't watched the first season at this point, you're not going to.
9279000	9282000	So, what you're saying is Kenny dies again?
9282000	9288000	Yeah, it's only that. So, my point is, is that going to ruin the entire series?
9288000	9297000	I mean, if it's a good show, it's not going to totally ruin it. Not that I think you should go around screaming these spoilers at the top of your lungs, but, you know.
9297000	9307000	You know, and you're right. Now, I have this thing called spoilers. I'm the type of person where, I don't care if you spoil it or not, I already know ahead of time if I'm going to watch it or not.
9307000	9317000	But don't bring it to my social media about spoilers because you don't know who will be, who I follow will see that. Directly send it to me.
9317000	9326000	And I understand about respecting of spoilers. Yes, you got those people who will spoil regardless. And then you got those, it happens purely by accident.
9326000	9330000	And then when you see people about to talk about it, they give you this fair warning.
9330000	9340000	Now, I understand that if you don't want to be spoiled, that you should go off of social media. And I understand from a business point of view, it's something you really can't do.
9340000	9348000	But it's like, at what point do you say, you know, I'm going to take a walk or no, you should take a walk, yada, yada, yada.
9348000	9360000	Because I know with Avengers Endgame, let's just say there were death threats going across my feed left and right. And I'm sitting in the chair eating Doritos just seeing how this plays out.
9360000	9368000	Because I have actually seen people block and unfriend each other over this. And I understand how big Marvel movies are.
9368000	9380000	But I'm like, are you really saying that this movie is so important means so much to you that you're going to get upset over a spoiler, and what could have been like a 15 year friendship over it?
9380000	9389000	Here's, here's the thing, I'm gonna and I'm going to kind of wrap it up on this and I want to make sure we have some time to get some of our other callers, as much as I enjoy talking to you, Rama.
9390000	9402000	I think when it comes to spoilers, another very important thing to do is just consider your audience. Like, you know, I'm sitting here doing this podcast, and I kind of realized, you know, it's probably not the right time for me to talk about Detective Pikachu yet, because not a lot of people have seen it.
9402000	9414000	But probably about the time Detective Pikachu is no longer in theaters. I'm going to probably be, you know, those people that cared enough about spoilers went and saw the movie when they had the chance in theaters.
9414000	9427000	So now maybe I'm going to talk about it, but I'm still going to be considerate and say, hey, spoiler, I'm going to, you know, even when we do talk about spoilers for Detective Pikachu, or whatever it is, I keep using that as an example, I'm going to say, hey, real quick, I want to talk about Detective Pikachu spoilers.
9427000	9437000	So if you like still didn't see it, because you're waiting for Netflix or something like fast forward 30 seconds, you know, or whatever it is, just consider your audience and just, you know, have have five seconds of consideration.
9437000	9454000	But at the same time, you have to show show a little leeway for movies and games and other medias that have been out for 20 years, because there comes a point where it's like, if you're not going to watch it or play it, and you still haven't, then you're clearly not going to
9454000	9455000	deal.
9455000	9459000	Do you guys know the hobbits took the ring to Mordor?
9459000	9462000	They made it to Mordor, toss it in the river.
9462000	9463000	What?
9463000	9464000	What?
9464000	9465000	Smog died.
9465000	9466000	All right.
9466000	9467000	Anyway.
9467000	9468000	All right.
9468000	9469000	That's it.
9469000	9470000	We're going to go to another call.
9470000	9471000	Rama, it's great to hear from you, as always, though.
9471000	9472000	Always.
9472000	9473000	Take care, y'all.
9473000	9474000	Hey, you gonna watch the Ingress anime?
9474000	9477000	As soon as Netflix drops it, yes, I've been a good anime fan.
9477000	9479640	I haven't been going through alternate means to watch it.
9479640	9481640	I've been waiting.
9481640	9482640	Rama, it's on there now.
9482640	9484640	It dropped a week and a half ago.
9484640	9485640	Oh, shit.
9485640	9486640	Do you know what?
9486640	9490640	I watched part of it earlier this week, so yeah, it's on there.
9490640	9492640	Bye, my friend.
9492640	9493640	Bye.
9493640	9494640	All right.
9494640	9495640	Let's get to another call.
9495640	9496640	I did not like it.
9496640	9497640	All right.
9497640	9498640	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
9498640	9499640	Who's this?
9499640	9500640	Hey, this is SSJ1 German.
9500640	9502640	Hey, it's great to hear from you, buddy.
9502640	9503640	What's up?
9503640	9504640	Not much.
9504640	9510640	I wanted to call in and talk about the loot box situation that's going on.
9510640	9511640	Please.
9511640	9513640	What's your perspective on all this?
9513640	9522640	So, I think a lot of companies have kind of like done a lot better job with handling
9522640	9523640	loot boxes.
9523640	9529800	Like, Overwatch kind of, it's mostly just skins and everything, and everybody's just
9529800	9536120	trying to transition because they know something like what's being proposed in the Senate could
9536120	9537120	happen.
9537120	9549120	EA, on the other hand, relies heavily on the loot box stuff with their sport games.
9549120	9556120	Primarily like with FIFA, Madden, and I think also with, but also with like with NHL.
9556120	9557120	Yup.
9557120	9559120	It's called Ultimate Team.
9559120	9560120	Yup.
9560120	9561120	Yup.
9561120	9569920	Where you're pretty much, you're buying packs to get players to build a team, and there's
9569920	9578660	like boosted players, there's periodic different players coming in and out, and you're basically
9578660	9582540	use these players to go up against other people.
9582540	9587160	I swear to God, if you're an executive at EA and you're not working on a contingency
9587160	9592560	plan for what happens if the plug gets pulled on loot boxes legally tomorrow, you shouldn't
9592560	9595600	be an executive getting paid that kind of salary at EA.
9595600	9599600	Like I really think like these folks have a responsibility.
9599600	9604000	I mean, you know, sure, they can think about how to milk this loot box thing for all it's
9604000	9606440	worth, but you have to have a little bit of fucking foresight.
9606440	9610800	And if what's going on here isn't a wake up call for you to figure out how you're going
9610800	9616440	to, I don't know, make money and whether that be that you just put out good games or you
9616440	9620520	think about a way to rope people in with subscription, maybe, you know, sports things
9620520	9621520	go to EA play.
9621520	9622520	I don't know.
9622520	9623520	There's a million things.
9623520	9626080	But like if you're at EA and you're an executive and you're not thinking about what am I going
9626080	9630440	to do if this loot box thing goes away tomorrow, then like you kind of deserve to fail.
9630440	9634920	Like I know it sounds really harsh, but you've got to be thinking a few steps ahead because
9634920	9636840	it's very possible that this could change.
9636840	9641800	And I don't think that anything I proposed a little bit ago about make it a little bit
9641800	9647600	harder to spend the money so that people are still able to spend money, I don't think
9647600	9653080	is as harsh of a all of a sudden these companies are going to lose so much money as as people
9653080	9654560	might think when I say that.
9654560	9660040	It's always funny playing picking up stuff on on the Xbox with games with gold because
9660040	9663440	you go to an Xbox one title get it's mine.
9663440	9665240	Admittedly, I have an active subscription.
9665240	9667240	So this point kind of falls flat.
9667240	9671120	But you're in the you're in the Microsoft store on the Xbox one.
9671120	9672120	You go to games with gold.
9672120	9675200	You pick up the Xbox one games, tap, get done.
9675200	9679360	And then since they still have their 360 compatibility layer, it's always a funny reminder when I
9679360	9685460	still have to explicitly put in my passphrase that changes that cognitive load just a little
9685460	9688000	bit out of the process as well.
9688000	9691880	And admittedly, this is, you know, me, me, myself and Irene that I'm talking about.
9691880	9692880	Not Princess Irene.
9692880	9694200	She has been on the show forever.
9694200	9695200	I miss her.
9695200	9698920	And talking about little me and nothing else, but like mobile.
9698920	9702800	Yeah, anything I say is going to be rehashing what you're saying.
9702800	9704120	Yes, there are parental controls.
9704120	9707040	Yes, there are ways of doing prepaid cards.
9707040	9710480	So you can't run up frickin thousands of dollars of charges.
9710480	9716160	Plenty of banking options for for kids to learn what money actually is when it's not
9716160	9717860	counting dollar bills anymore.
9717860	9719120	Let me ask this question, Matt.
9719120	9723120	And I'm going to I'm going to I'm going to do this with a great thing we do in the corporate
9723120	9725920	world, which is don't bring me problems.
9725920	9726920	Bring me solutions.
9726920	9727920	Right.
9727920	9728920	We've all heard that in the corporate world.
9728920	9729920	Right.
9729920	9732880	So what I'm saying is maybe you don't have an answer for this, Matt, and it's OK.
9732880	9736080	How do you think the industry fixes this problem?
9736080	9742880	Well, I think a lot of companies have kind of like tried to do like the best that they
9742880	9744120	can.
9744120	9748120	But I think with like the issue with like, yay, what they're going to have to do is like
9748120	9753120	right now, you know, like the little bit of research I did before this call, yay, with
9753120	9757640	the ultimate team revenue that they get is about eight hundred million dollars.
9757640	9763500	So they're going to like try everything possible to try to avoid, you know, this happening.
9763500	9772160	But in the cases where last year there was a lawsuit in Belgium over these loot boxes
9772160	9778440	being considered gambling, EA ended up settling with that.
9778440	9785880	And what they did in Belgium, all the Belgian players who play FIFA, they can't purchase
9785880	9788800	points with real money.
9788800	9793740	They have to earn that money in game and they just flipped it off.
9793740	9799540	It's so interesting how many corporations and that's why I say like you kind of you
9799540	9803580	kind of pick and choose what, you know, what losses you're willing to take to still be
9803580	9805100	able to make the money.
9805100	9811100	And so many country or excuse me, so many gaming companies wrote off Belgium.
9811100	9812100	That's what's happened.
9812100	9814380	That's what so many gaming companies, they've just written off Belgium.
9814380	9818040	Well, we just can't make money that way in Belgium anymore.
9818040	9820180	Just wrote it off.
9820180	9825480	And like real quickly, my possible idea for how they would like try to like get around
9825480	9831840	this or like try to fix it is that they would maybe kind of do like what Fortnite does and
9831840	9838620	have like a rotating, you know, skin thing where it's like every 12 hours a new skin
9838620	9844800	will be out or like if in this case with EA Sports games, a player will be available.
9844800	9852760	A special player will be available and you can only get that with money purchased like
9852760	9853760	that.
9853760	9858480	So you don't have to take out the randomness, but just like you have yourself to spend money,
9858480	9863040	real money to just buy that player.
9863040	9867120	Heroes of the Storm and League of Legends are actually, that's kind of like what they
9867120	9868120	do.
9868120	9871860	Like you have like a rotating roster of free heroes and they rotate, but if you decide
9871860	9877320	you like one, you can kind of pay either the gold that you did a lot of grinding in game
9877320	9881200	to earn or you just, hey, you can spend real money on some gems and use the gems to buy
9881200	9882200	the hero.
9882200	9885680	So it's funny that you mentioned that because that is kind of the way that like League of
9885680	9890480	Legends or something works and they don't seem to be in as much hot water as certain
9890480	9891480	other games.
9891480	9892480	So be interesting.
9892480	9896240	And I think that's like the, that's the little loophole that I think a lot of companies are
9896240	9897240	going to have to do.
9897240	9898240	Yeah.
9898240	9899240	All right.
9899240	9900240	Well, great, great topic, Matt.
9900240	9901240	I appreciate your insight.
9901240	9903440	I'm going to let you go so we can squeeze in one more call, but thanks so much for the
9903440	9904440	call.
9904440	9905440	Okay.
9905440	9906440	Sure thing.
9906440	9907440	Thanks.
9907440	9908440	Yeah, no problem.
9908440	9909440	Take care, buddy.
9909440	9910440	All right.
9910440	9911440	Let's bring in one more call and we will say hello.
9911680	9912680	Hi, you're on Orange Songs Radio.
9912680	9913680	Who's this?
9913680	9916040	Hey, this is PixelPakas.
9916040	9917600	It is so good to hear from you, PixelPakas.
9917600	9918600	What's on your mind?
9918600	9923360	So, um, I just wanted to talk a bit about Dreams and like some of the questions you
9923360	9925960	had in this show in the last episode.
9925960	9926960	Please do.
9926960	9927960	When do I get to play it?
9927960	9928960	When do I get to play it?
9928960	9935200	I mean, that's the question that's been up and is still not answered, but supposedly
9935200	9940020	it will come out in full complete form later this year, but there's no month or anything
9940020	9941820	even.
9941820	9945580	But what I think is interesting and what I kind of learned by watching some of the Media
9945580	9951980	Molecule live streams is basically they're treating the current version that's out right
9951980	9956580	now on PS4 as like the game is out.
9956580	9960840	The creation tools are basically all there already.
9960840	9965540	They may tweak some stuff and fix bugs, but as far as the creation aspect of the game
9965540	9972220	is concerned, they feel like that's a 1.0 that's out now, that's ready for everyone.
9972220	9980380	What they're working on still is actually a single player mode and also VR, a VR version
9980380	9982320	of Dreams, which is not ready yet.
9982320	9988220	And I wonder if there isn't, you know, sort of some asset to having the creation tools
9988220	9993420	out there in advance so that when the game launches, they're going to be able to say
9993420	9998220	over 5,000 games already available or whatever the number is, obviously I'm pulling that
9998220	10003200	out of my ass, but basically by allowing people to create and kind of use that now, you know,
10003200	10007300	they're going to be able to come out and say, we've already have all these games in Dreams.
10007300	10010820	So if you plunk down the 60 bucks to pick this game up, you're going to get access to
10010820	10012280	all of this.
10012280	10015340	And that's, well, I think they also want to know what kind of things people are doing
10015340	10020780	with the game so they could figure out what tools to make to enhance levels galore.
10020780	10022780	You get a penis and you get a penis.
10022780	10027540	That's what it's, it's art on, on video game stuff.
10027540	10029140	Of course there's going to be that.
10029140	10030140	Come on.
10030140	10031140	Sure.
10031140	10034780	Sounds an awful lot like a soft launch.
10034780	10036100	This game is going to be a flop.
10036100	10039220	That was a triple entendre I just pulled there.
10039220	10043060	Um, what was I going to say with all of that?
10043060	10044060	Damn it.
10044060	10045060	Damn you.
10045060	10048140	Um, Oh, I was going to, I was actually going to say hopefully like little big planet, there'll
10048140	10051940	be a Parker Posey level cause to this, to this day, that's my favorite level they ever
10051940	10053720	came out with in little big planet.
10053720	10057640	Somebody did a shrine to Parker Posey and you just unlocked all these Parker Posey stickers
10057640	10058640	and things like that.
10058640	10059640	Man.
10059640	10061700	Little big planet was such a great fucking little big planet was a great.
10061700	10062700	Oh my God.
10062700	10063700	Yeah.
10063700	10064700	I know.
10064700	10066900	I, I, I am always like, I miss it and I wish they'd put out another one.
10066900	10069420	It's like, Oh, that's kind of what they're doing with dreams.
10069420	10074820	I never did play through three so I still could do that because it's in my library.
10074820	10075820	Why not?
10075820	10076820	Why not?
10076820	10081620	And let me ask this, uh, pixel pockets, have you, have you gotten your hands on, uh, dreams
10081620	10082620	yet?
10082620	10083620	Are you playing it?
10083620	10085020	Yes, I am.
10085020	10090020	Um, I've mostly actually been sort of playing other people's stuff.
10090020	10095380	Um, I went through like the tutorials that they give you for how to create things, but
10095380	10100580	I'm not really, I don't have a vision in my head of like what I could create.
10100580	10102940	So I've just been sort of sampling everyone else's stuff.
10102940	10103940	Uh huh.
10103940	10106620	Um, they have this fun mode that's kind of like channel surfing basically, where you
10106620	10110340	just sort of go through a level of someone's game and go to another level of someone else.
10110340	10112020	You just sort of check out different stuff.
10112020	10115220	Um, and I've been having a lot of fun with that actually.
10115220	10120380	Just that component I feel is worth it to me personally, just to see what weird shit
10120380	10123740	people are making because you know, it's not all games.
10123740	10129780	Some people have made like little movies or music videos or some sort of artwork that
10129780	10133100	they're displaying and you can kind of look around and walk through.
10133100	10136520	You know, Mario Maker's kind of done that too.
10136520	10140020	Like the majority of what you see in Mario Maker are Mario levels.
10140020	10143080	And of course you see the hell levels, asshole Mario type of stuff.
10143080	10146940	But then you have those Mario levels that are like, this Mario level plays itself and
10146940	10149500	as it plays itself, it plays a song.
10149500	10152460	And I remember that was a big thing in Little Big Planet too, as you hop in the car and
10152460	10155820	it will like just zoom through the level and play a song as you're zooming through.
10155820	10159260	So it is interesting to see how people kind of use that toolbox.
10159260	10162900	And I think, you know, the, the general consensus that we're coming up with here is kind of
10162900	10167340	on the head is that the creators kind of want to see what that looks like as well.
10167340	10171260	So maybe they know how to market their game a little bit, but let me ask you this before
10171260	10176880	we let you go so we can wrap up what, give us an example of one thing that you've played
10176880	10184480	in Dreams that made you go, whoa, that was cool.
10184480	10189420	So I mean, my favorite things I've really been just seeing the weird stuff that people
10189420	10190880	are experimenting with.
10190880	10197120	Like I saw this one, just this thing called Rat City.
10197120	10202680	It's kind of like a noir themed world with rats who like smoke and wear fedoras.
10202680	10206060	And it's not really, there's not even a game, it's just sort of, you're inhibiting this
10206060	10208660	exploring person's world that they have made.
10208660	10213320	And you could add a game to it, but I thought it was fun to see here is the stuff that people
10213320	10217960	are creating, who I assume, you know, I don't know if they're developers, they've done
10217960	10222040	anything before, but it's just someone making like this thing that they've always wanted
10222040	10224640	to see in a video game.
10224640	10227960	And I like, I feel that it's very powerful that you could just sort of make what you
10227960	10233200	want, or like someone I've seen, I can't remember the name of, but this person who's been using
10233200	10236220	the Dreams tools to sculpt things.
10236220	10240300	And so they've made like this museum digitally of their sculptures and put little stories
10240300	10241300	with it.
10241300	10244900	And then you go up to a sculpture and you hear like a narration going on.
10244900	10248740	So it's kind of like a lot of like the kind of walking simulator type things that they're
10248740	10253020	putting in, but it's just sort of like the freedom for someone to make what they have
10253020	10256780	wanted to make and not have a way to express that because maybe they don't know how to
10256780	10262040	use Unity or Unreal Engine, you know, they're not a programmer per se, but they're still
10262040	10264820	able to share their art with everyone.
10264820	10268340	And I find that really exciting just in and of itself.
10268860	10272260	And you know what's so interesting about the way you describe that when you talk about
10272260	10277020	like making an experience that's kind of like, if I could make a video game, this is kind
10277020	10280520	of like the adventure that's in my head, or this is what I'm going to be making with the
10280520	10284220	tools that are in front of me, this story that I particularly have that I want to tell.
10284220	10291140	I am so, so, so reminded of an experience that was 25 years ago that we don't shut up
10291140	10292940	about on this show to date.
10292940	10293940	ZZT.
10293940	10295660	I mean, think about it.
10295660	10301180	I mean, I realize Dreams is going to be a lot more, you know, a lot fancier, a lot showier,
10301180	10303380	but if you think about it, man, remember making games?
10303380	10307220	Remember downloading the ZZT levels on a BBS and you're like, what is this crack smoker
10307220	10310940	smoking making this level, you know, all those like different things, like getting inside
10310940	10315340	crazy people's heads and like some of the things that, and not just, you know, obviously
10315340	10318380	like, you know, people that have artistic visions and stuff too, just seeing the things
10318380	10320420	that people come up with are just, it's just mind blowing.
10320420	10321420	It's awesome.
10321420	10325460	So anyway, I am so excited for this game to launch.
10325460	10327900	So I'm be sure to let me know when I can buy it.
10327900	10328900	Okay.
10328900	10329900	We'll do.
10329900	10330900	All right.
10330900	10331900	Sounds good.
10331900	10332900	All right.
10332900	10333900	Take care.
10333900	10334900	And, uh, thanks so much for the call.
10334900	10335900	Yeah.
10335900	10336900	See you.
10336900	10337900	All right.
10337900	10338900	Bye bye.
10338900	10339900	All right.
10339900	10340900	That was some good calls tonight.
10340900	10341900	We're good.
10341900	10342900	You're good luck.
10342900	10343900	You should come to the show more often.
10343900	10344900	We get some good calls when you're here.
10344900	10346180	Not that the calls are bad when you're not here.
10346180	10350460	We had a lot of some, some nights we're sitting here going, please call us with some solid
10350460	10351460	calls tonight.
10351460	10352460	I appreciate that.
10352460	10355060	Hey, if for whatever reason you were being shy, you didn't want to call in or what have
10355060	10358220	you, you can always send us an email, participate at orange andre.com.
10358220	10363740	You can also reach out to us on Twitter at O L R. Um, but for now, unless Loki has any
10363740	10366100	other last minute stories, no doubt he does.
10366100	10367100	All right.
10367100	10369940	Then I think we're gonna start to wrap things up here for tonight.
10369940	10373940	Finishing, finishing off, uh, what I want to, what I wanted to say, uh, in response
10373940	10374940	to that call.
10374940	10378940	Um, have you guys by chance seen the director's commentary and behind the scenes stuff of
10378940	10379940	ready player one?
10379940	10383100	No, I mean, God, I barely saw the movie.
10383140	10385060	I mean, I obviously I did see it.
10385060	10389580	Uh, Bobby finally made me sit down and watch it and his, his fancy, um, if you, if you
10389580	10393480	get access to, if you decide to buy, if you have any way you've been able to see the behind
10393480	10395060	the scenes stuff, please do.
10395060	10400020	Because I saw like everything, everything you just talked about, uh, with ZZT way back
10400020	10401020	in the past.
10401020	10402020	I played that at a friend's house.
10402020	10404300	I was more a mood mud exploration.
10404300	10406020	I'm going to do a live stream is easy to this week.
10406020	10409980	I think I kids today don't understand the coolest.
10409980	10411820	We're going to educate the children with some ZZT.
10411820	10418780	The coolest modern, um, environment system that I have ever seen was in the behind the
10418780	10420340	scenes of ready player one.
10420340	10425140	They filmed everything with the actors because as you know, good half ish of it is in a virtual
10425140	10426140	world, more than half.
10426140	10430580	Um, and what they did was they created a, they, they shot all of the footage so that
10430580	10439060	they had all of the actors mocap and then they created a crude rendered world of, uh,
10439060	10443300	Oh man, am I seriously going to forget what it was called away?
10443300	10444300	So shit.
10444300	10445300	Thank you.
10445300	10446300	Oh man.
10446300	10447300	I never really watched the movie.
10447300	10453540	Um, so they, they created, they, they created a, almost a literal game using the world data
10453540	10457420	of Oasis for Spielberg to act like a director.
10457420	10464820	He had a backpack, a camera, a virtual camera rig, VR glasses, and he shot the virtual world
10464820	10466780	with the real actors footage.
10466780	10470520	So there were some, there were some stock, you know, T poses, crude animations.
10470520	10476220	It wasn't, it wasn't polished, but he could take his vision, his director's eye, he could
10476220	10481780	take the capabilities of what he's literally spent his entire professional life doing and
10481780	10484600	apply it into a virtual world that people created for him.
10484600	10490020	It looked fucking phenomenal because you're, he, he, he gets his, he gets his, he, he's
10490020	10495380	in a world, he's a player in a world, he gets his zoom, he gets his lens, he gets his depth,
10495380	10496940	he gets everything else.
10496940	10498900	You know, I want, I want this transition.
10498900	10501220	I want this angle for this movement.
10501220	10505300	And he got to direct the virtual world after the cast and shooting was done.
10505300	10510060	And it's also interesting to think about where is that going to lead future Hollywood movies,
10510060	10514140	that sort of way of thinking, you know, it's like after the matrix came out, then it was
10514140	10516940	how are all these other movies going to use bullet time, you know?
10516940	10517940	Right.
10517940	10519860	I mean, it is, it is, it is a piece of our era.
10519860	10521940	It is definitely what we're coming into.
10521940	10525340	Did you speaking of which you of all people, did you hear these recent rumors about a man
10525340	10530780	matrix sequel, like out of the blue, but I mean, the Wachowskis don't have since eight
10530780	10531780	anymore.
10531780	10532780	Rest in peace.
10532780	10535180	So it would make sense that if they want to work on a new movie, they might, that might
10535180	10536180	be, why not?
10536180	10537820	I know I'd be all about that too.
10537820	10539980	I think they just look at John wick.
10539980	10540980	Yes.
10540980	10546900	I want more piano and all the things we, we got to wrap up, we're coming up on the three
10546900	10547900	hour market.
10547900	10548900	We got a late start as it was.
10548900	10549900	So we got to wrap up for the show night.
10549900	10550900	Jason.
10550900	10551900	It's great to have you here.
10551900	10552900	And again, thank you.
10552900	10553900	Thank you for everything you guys don't understand.
10553900	10558820	The show would not be here still if Jason did not, um, help in a tremendous away as
10558820	10559820	he does all the time.
10559820	10560820	So thank you so much.
10560820	10561820	I like pushing buttons.
10561820	10562820	I like playing with tech.
10562820	10565220	And I like, I like, we like hearing what you have to say here on the show, sit in the studio
10565220	10566220	when he can.
10566220	10569300	So, uh, not only do you do the Epic voiceovers, but we appreciate hearing your perspective
10569300	10574580	most of the times when I'm not sitting in my car in 7,000, 8,000 feet, however high
10574580	10579620	truck he is and yeah, well, uh, you're, you know, you're welcome back anytime, but I had
10579620	10582620	the gear there and I got it done and it was, it was, it was a, it was relevant.
10582620	10583620	That's what I go for.
10584340	10585340	Well, we'll hear from you next week.
10585340	10586340	If nothing else.
10586340	10587340	Yep.
10587340	10588340	All right.
10588340	10590740	I said, I'm starting to, I, I, uh, I got the bottom of the well on all my parodies
10590740	10593460	again, so I have to invent new ones coming weeks.
10593460	10594460	So we'll see.
10594460	10595460	All right.
10595460	10596460	I welcome listener submissions as well.
10596460	10599180	In fact, I think I still have some in that one email that I never did.
10599180	10603180	So probably do, uh, since we, since a lot of this is, uh, is old stuff coming, coming
10603180	10607460	around again, star Wars, slanking, Aladdin, all that kind of stuff has arrived for the
10607460	10608460	pick.
10608460	10609460	Don't spoil.
10609460	10610460	Talk about it offline.
10610460	10611460	All right.
10611500	10614500	Any final thoughts or what have you for our listeners tonight?
10614500	10619220	Oh, um, good night.
10619220	10620220	Good night.
10620220	10621860	An actual night of sleep after the road.
10621860	10622860	Take a nap.
10622860	10623860	You deserve it.
10623860	10626740	Uh, as I say, towards the end of every episode of orange launch radio, please tell a friend
10626740	10627740	or two about the show.
10627740	10628740	Help us spread the word.
10628740	10631500	Cause we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but, uh, if the voices aren't out
10631500	10634040	there to put out over the air, uh, then we can't air them.
10634040	10637060	So please, uh, help us spread the word, tell a friend or two about the show.
10637060	10641580	Um, auto hosts on, uh, Twitch for VOG network go a long, long way.
10641580	10644940	I put out a tweet, basically ugly begging for that today and it worked.
10644940	10648660	So I'm thank you to those of you that added us to your list that, that really helps with
10648660	10649660	discoverability.
10649660	10650660	We really appreciate that.
10650660	10653500	Um, Loki, do you have a final thought for us tonight?
10653500	10654500	Sure.
10654500	10657900	I'll, I've mentioned real quick, uh, 30th anniversary of the Ninja turtles game from
10657900	10659420	the NES in Japan.
10659420	10660800	So that's today.
10660800	10664020	And apparently 30th anniversary of the mega drive as well.
10664020	10666020	That was on the 20th.
10666020	10667020	Great.
10667020	10671100	Uh, and my final thought is, um, I really should have done all 18 missions today, but
10671100	10672500	my lazy ass only did six.
10672500	10673500	What can you do?
10673500	10674500	All right.
10674500	10676020	Time constraints and everything else.
10676020	10677260	I do have a final thought.
10677260	10678260	All right.
10678260	10680020	I want to rerecord what you're about to press play on.
10680020	10682500	Oh, the, I don't, you want to redo the outro?
10682500	10683500	Eventually.
10683500	10684500	All right.
10684500	10685500	Sorry.
10685500	10686500	I want it.
10686500	10687660	I want it with my microphone and my set up at home.
10687660	10689180	And I've been talking about having a new interest.
10689180	10691580	I mean, we love MIDI head and we appreciate it, but like, let's be real.
10691580	10696100	We have, we have driven that intro song into the ground over probably like 15 of the 17
10696100	10697100	years we've used that song.
10697100	10701420	So I've had ideas, but unfortunately it's such grand dose ideas that they'll never come
10701420	10703740	far as your games.
10703740	10706460	Maybe we should ask you, maybe we should ask your kid to write an intro.
10706460	10708060	At least we know it'll get done.
10708060	10709060	Dude.
10709060	10710060	The game's right here.
10710060	10711060	Okay.
10711060	10712060	You can see there.
10712060	10713060	I watched him play it.
10713060	10714060	I went around a little maze with a webcam.
10714060	10715060	That's it.
10715060	10716060	We're out fade to black.
10716060	10717060	We're done for the night.
10717060	10718500	We'll see, but we'll, we'll see you in seven days.
10718500	10721980	Seven seven seven next week, dark soccer will be back with us.
10721980	10725180	And then, uh, you know, it's going to be a big show cause we get a week after off after
10725180	10726180	that.
10726180	10727180	So lucky, lucky.
10727180	10728180	Have a great night, everybody.
10728180	10729180	Thank you for being here.
10729180	10730180	Good night.
10730180	10733660	You've been listening to orange lounge radio.
