0	28000	This week we've learned that we're only a few months away from going back to a simpler time before pandas, undead kings, and literally half as many levels as now. But until then we've got lots of gaming news, events, and history to cover all of this starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.
28000	32000	Orange Lounge Radio
32000	47000	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio. Live tonight with episode number 777, and that must stand for something, for this May 19th of 2019.
47000	49000	We're gonna be Lucky Lounge Radio.
49000	54000	My name is Rob Roberts and that voice you hear over there. Welcome back this week, DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
54000	55000	Oh hi.
55000	56000	Hi, how are you?
56000	58000	Fine, tired but fine.
58000	62000	Good. I'm gonna ask about your week off and some other stuff here real quick as well.
62000	63000	Alright.
63000	66000	Alright, and of course we do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice Geeks Network.
66000	72000	Twitch.tv slash VOG Network right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at about 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern.
72000	81000	And since it is video as well as audio you can see everything that's going on behind the scenes including sometimes when your third host is running a little bit behind schedule.
81000	89000	Well, if you know some people would just make their teriyaki in a speedy manner instead of spending 25 minutes.
89000	91000	Well hello, Loki. How are you?
91000	92000	I'm good.
92000	95000	Next time you should ask to speak to the manager.
95000	97000	Yeah, I don't think that'll help.
97000	99000	Show everyone your shirt. RIP.
99000	101000	Oh, the Grumpy Cat shirt.
101000	107000	I don't know if this is true or not though. Did you hear some of the weird things about the fact that the cat may not have had a very nice name to begin with?
107000	109000	Well no, the cat's name was Tartar Sauce.
109000	120000	And the rumor is, and this could be a Snopes thing, I haven't looked it up, but that Tartar Sauce was an elongated name for an unfortunate short name that was given to the cat at one point.
120000	123000	I'll let you imagine what that might be.
123000	124000	Okay.
124000	126000	So, yeah, but anyway.
126000	129000	As far as I've known since the cat was a kitten, it's name was Tartar Sauce.
129000	136000	I'm just, yeah, I'm hoping that story is just some weird Twitter made up thing and isn't actually true because that would be unfortunate.
136000	139000	But regardless, we know that that cat meant a lot to many people, so.
139000	147000	But I also encourage people that if you have cats, make sure that you do things to keep their urinary health handled, taken care of.
147000	160000	If there seems to be any type of pain when touching the rear of your cat, you know, they react badly to it or you see any odd bloating, get your cat taken care of immediately.
160000	164000	Urinary tract infections in a cat are a definite killer.
164000	167000	Not like with a human where we can drink some cranberry and be better.
167000	168000	Right.
168000	169000	Not for a cat.
169000	175000	But also, you know, we don't want anybody to, like, feel terrible if, you know, something, you know, pets do pass away.
175000	176000	It's hard. It's hard.
176000	177000	And it happens, yeah.
177000	179000	But midna seven.
179000	180000	Yeah, sure.
180000	181000	Yeah.
181000	182000	So, anyway.
182000	184000	All right. On to happier, happier thoughts.
184000	186000	Happy thoughts. Find your happy place.
186000	192000	I want to get to our kickoff topic here in a moment, but while Loki's still getting settled in from running from the teriyaki place from hell.
192000	198000	Let me ask you, Dark Soccer, you've been gone for a week because I know you had some conflicts with Mother's Day last week.
198000	201000	Yeah, we ended up going somewhere pretty fancy.
201000	204000	Yeah. Well, hey, I ditched the show for a fancy dinner, too.
204000	205000	In fact-
205000	207000	There was lobster and filet mignon involved.
207000	211000	In fact, God willing, a week from tonight, I'll be out of town.
211000	213000	And when Alan and I go out of town, we like to eat.
213000	215000	So maybe Sunday night we'll get to go somewhere fancy.
215000	218000	I'm sorry I won't be here to take care of the smoosh.
218000	223000	Oh, that's okay. He's got somebody else to take care of. One of my Ingress pals is actually taking care of him.
223000	226000	So it's kind of funny, like the people you meet playing video games.
226000	227000	Yeah.
227000	228000	So, yeah.
228000	229000	That's good.
229000	231000	Anyway, I don't know if you know Pesch.
231000	232000	No.
232000	233000	Yeah, that's all right.
233000	237000	Anyway, a big thank you to him, although I don't think he listens to the show anyway.
237000	245000	But anyhow, let me ask you, Dark Soccer, you were gone last week, but this weekend you were pretty busy, too, even though you were here for the show.
245000	246000	Good Lord.
246000	249000	You've been visiting a pinball show, right?
249000	252000	Yes, it was formerly Pin-A-Go-Go in Dixon.
252000	257000	They since moved to Lodi in the Grape Festival buildings.
257000	260000	But it's now called the Golden State Pinball Expo.
260000	262000	The first one was last year.
262000	273000	The second year they've got a bigger showing from some of the other – I'm trying to say developers – some of the other designers.
273000	275000	There was a big Stern presence, of course.
275000	276000	Marco Pinball was there.
276000	278000	You know, they do pinball supply.
278000	284000	We had a few of the other – is it P3, I think, that did the modular pinballs?
284000	287000	Lexi Lightspeed, and they have a new one now.
287000	294000	But I got to play – I mean, the highlight of the thing for me, the thing I was most looking forward to, is playing Black Knight Sword of Rage.
294000	296000	And I'm going to tell you this.
296000	301000	If you're thinking about getting a Black Knight Sword of Rage, don't get the pro, get the premium.
301000	304000	Trust me, it's worth the extra $1,200.
304000	306000	Because it has the top play field.
306000	308000	It's not Black Knight without the top play field.
308000	310000	For those of you that have the extra $1,200 just lying around.
310000	312000	But no, I understand.
312000	315000	If you're going to drop that kind of money on your passion, I get it.
315000	317000	You've got to go all out.
317000	319000	Getting the pro is settling.
319000	325000	It's just like when they say, you know, one of these days I want to get a Tesla, but I'm not going to get just the base model Tesla.
325000	330000	I don't normally like to show my phone that much, but if you can see, that is the Black Knight Sword of Rage that I played.
330000	332000	It's a little blurry, but sure.
332000	334000	Next time get some video.
334000	336000	I got some video of some of it.
336000	338000	Send it to me in advance and I can put it as B-roll.
338000	340000	I'm going to get Tesla the scientist.
340000	342000	Forget this car stuff.
342000	344000	There's another look at the marquee.
344000	346000	Yeah, it's a little blurry. That's alright.
346000	348000	That's alright.
348000	350000	That was really one of the highlights.
350000	355000	I did get a little bit of video of people playing it, but my video is not great since I took it with my phone.
356000	362000	I kept hitting the MagnaSave way too late so I would waste my MagnaSave.
362000	364000	It's not easy.
364000	367000	The Black Knight tables have never been particularly easy.
367000	376000	Although I would still go on record saying Black Knight 2000 is better, still this one is by no means any kind of a slouch.
376000	378000	I love the video modes in it.
378000	380000	Just kind of neat stuff.
380000	384000	How many people go to this convention to try all these new tables and classic tables?
385000	387000	As easily a few hundred.
387000	392000	Maybe, I don't know, maybe it got up to a thousand. I'm not the best judge of a crowd.
392000	394000	I'd say more like around 500 or so.
394000	400000	That's still not a bad turnout for what is, and I mean this with all due respect, what's in the middle of nowhere, California really.
400000	403000	And there were people there from Canada.
403000	409000	I saw shirts for their Canadian pinball group, some from San Francisco, Bay Area.
410000	416000	Up the west coast there were some of the Oregon ones, some of the others.
416000	420000	So it was a pretty good showing.
420000	425000	And like I said, there was a big support from a lot of the developers.
428000	434000	I also was very pleased to see, despite having a lot of the newer pins,
434000	439000	one thing that did disappoint me was seeing fewer of the protos there.
439000	442000	There was no Big Bang Bar.
442000	446000	That was really what was surprising and disappointing to me because Big Bang Bar was there last year.
446000	451000	For those who don't know, it was a Capcom prototype that they made I think 16 of.
451000	458000	And we knew a couple of people who had legit ones and then the license got released for another company to reproduce them.
458000	462000	So you can find more Big Bang Bars out in the wild.
462000	466000	And Kingpin was the other one that Capcom was doing.
466000	471000	But there were some interesting ones that I hadn't seen for a while.
471000	474000	Of course, they have the classic pinball room right in the front.
478000	482000	In the middle area is where usually the showcase ones are,
482000	490000	like some of the nicer pins and some of the more fan favorite ones,
490000	492000	although there was not a theater.
492000	495000	And honestly, we didn't bring our theater because our theater is too nice.
495000	498000	I wouldn't want it dinged up. Our theater is in really pretty shape.
498000	501000	A lot of times if you go to one of those types of conventions,
501000	504000	whether it's pinball or old arcade games or what have you in your area,
504000	510000	a lot of times those machines are being donated by enthusiasts that have these machines in their houses.
510000	511000	We bought three.
511000	514000	So y'all got to treat them with respect.
514000	521000	Yeah, these are not arcade player beater ones that they expect to see something happen to.
521000	523000	These are people's babies.
523000	526000	That's why I hate when I see disrespectful kids at these events,
526000	528000	which to be fair, I usually don't.
528000	533000	But I've seen it once or twice, and it's really irritating because it's one thing.
533000	537000	I'm not like, screw them. Don't bring them.
537000	542000	I'm all for educating, letting your kids play stuff that are historic and old games.
542000	546000	But you've got to make sure your kids respect the stuff.
546000	547000	Totally.
547000	554000	Well, one of the other cool things with this one is that there were actually a few, though,
554000	556000	that I was really looking forward to see and was glad to.
556000	560000	Like Black Rose, I maybe see one hanging around.
560000	562000	There were a couple. There were a lot of Doctor Who's.
562000	564000	We just got our Doctor Who not long ago.
564000	570000	So we brought Doctor Who, The Shadow, which, I mean, bad movie, great pinball.
570000	574000	And our old one, Spanish Eyes, is from 1972.
574000	579000	I found one that's called Four Queens, and it's actually a poker-themed game,
579000	582000	but I wanted to retool it to be four drag queens.
582000	584000	But I wanted to put local queens on it.
584000	586000	Okay, fine.
586000	589000	Dan and I just kind of joked about it.
589000	593000	But I did play a bunch, and that's going to get into my games of the week,
593000	595000	which I could go ahead and do.
595000	597000	No, I think we're going to get into our kickoff topic.
597000	600000	I just wanted to kind of, at a high level, talk about the expo and so forth.
600000	602000	So it's a yearly thing or a twice yearly thing?
602000	605000	It is yearly. And Pinna-Go-Go is still going on.
605000	608000	This one replaced the original Pinna-Go-Go.
608000	612000	Pinna-Go-Go is now happening later in the year in Dixon.
612000	613000	I see.
613000	616000	Which, thank God, because going at this time,
616000	618000	now with the rain going on here that we have right now,
618000	622000	it's actually been okay, except the drive to Lodi was harrowing.
622000	624000	There was an overturned semi.
624000	625000	Yikes.
625000	630000	But the problem with Pinna-Go-Go before
630000	634000	was that it was in this big, un-air-conditioned silo building
634000	637000	and corn pollen.
637000	639000	Well, yeah, but you're right.
639000	642000	Now that the weather is like this, where it's raining at the end of May
642000	645000	and cold outside, which is totally unusual.
645000	648000	Whether you like it or not, it's unusual for this time of year.
648000	650000	There was a ton of hail in Stockton, too.
650000	652000	Was there really? I saw there was a big...
652000	654000	It was supposed to thunderstorm, though, today.
654000	656000	I was supposed to go to Davis Pride this morning.
656000	659000	Maybe our lucky episode will get knocked out by the power.
659000	660000	Wouldn't that be a hoot and a holler?
660000	663000	I was supposed to go to Davis Pride today with the sisters,
663000	665000	and we're like, we're going to get rained out.
665000	667000	Thunderstorms, I'm like, okay, I'm not going.
667000	668000	Sleep in.
668000	670000	I wake up, and it's sunshine for like a minute.
670000	671000	Yeah, I think there's a little bit late.
671000	672000	And then, vroom.
672000	673000	Yeah.
673000	675000	So I repotted some plants.
675000	677000	All right, anyway.
677000	679000	We're going to get into our kickoff topic for tonight,
679000	681000	and then we'll talk a little more pinball with you a little later,
681000	683000	I'm sure, Dar-Sakura.
683000	685000	And then we'll give Loki a chance to shovel food into his mouth.
685000	688000	But I do want you to talk about the follow-up to this kickoff topic.
688000	690000	Well, I can talk about this, too, because I watched it.
690000	691000	Oh, okay, good.
691000	696000	Because I didn't actually watch this direct that happened,
696000	698000	and of course we're talking about the Super Mario Maker 2 direct
698000	699000	that happened this week.
699000	700000	I didn't actually watch it.
700000	702000	I just read the highlights.
702000	703000	So do you want me to go over the highlights,
703000	704000	and then you can touch on anything I missed?
704000	707000	Yeah, you can, because a lot of it was just kind of retreading
707000	709000	and it seems like, if you've never seen Mario Maker before,
709000	711000	here's Mario Maker kind of stuff.
711000	713000	Okay, but I think there was a lot of new stuff
713000	715000	that they unveiled in that trailer,
715000	719000	where I actually think in some ways Loki has the reverse,
719000	721000	where I think many people were thinking this game
721000	724000	was just going to pretty much be a rehashing of Mario Maker
724000	726000	for the Wii U, but with some extra stuff.
726000	728000	But when we talk about some extra stuff,
728000	730000	we're talking about extra stuff.
730000	731000	There's a ton of extra stuff.
731000	732000	Yeah, a ton of extra stuff.
732000	736000	So a 100-level story mode is probably the big thing right off the bat.
736000	739000	So now there's stuff to do in a single-player mode,
739000	742000	and you basically are rebuilding Princess Peach's castle,
742000	744000	and you get rewards when you complete levels
744000	745000	for constructing the castle and so forth.
745000	747000	So that's pretty neat.
747000	749000	There are new settings, themes, and enemies,
749000	751000	which, you know, kind of you'd expect.
751000	756000	Yeah, it's the woods, desert, snow, and sky.
756000	758000	Yep, and nighttime, too, as well, right?
758000	762000	Right, they have the moon block, or I don't know what they call it.
762000	765000	That's not the mad moon, mad sun, but mad moon,
765000	768000	or not mad moon, happy moon, it's a moon.
769000	772000	Anyway, stages can also have wind conditions
772000	775000	that are not just touching the flag at the end.
775000	777000	That's going to get very interesting for creativity.
777000	781000	That was Mario 2, like legit old-school Mario 2 with the wind effect.
781000	785000	Yeah, so it could also be the fact that you might have to collect
785000	788000	a certain number of coins, and that will clear the level.
788000	791000	Perhaps there is a specific power-up that you have to grab
791000	793000	during the level and finish with that.
793000	795000	So that could be very interesting.
795000	799000	There's also going to be a Super Mario 3D World theme,
799000	802000	but it's being treated a little separately than the rest of them,
802000	806000	because it adds different things that they are not scaling back to,
806000	808000	like 8-bit Mario and things like that.
808000	811000	So things like Cat Mario are going to be exclusive to 3D World.
811000	814000	And even though it's 3D World, you're still making 2D stages,
814000	817000	it's just the 3D World theme that goes with it.
817000	819000	So that's kind of fun.
819000	822000	This also means trampolines and some unique enemies, as well.
822000	824000	And then this is huge.
824000	828000	And you know what's funny? Not that I want to say I called it,
828000	831000	but this is what I said way back in the day.
831000	833000	If you want to convince a Mario Maker 2,
833000	836000	here's the number one thing you can do that would just change the game
836000	839000	and make it a whole new experience.
839000	842000	Competitive play is in, as well as online.
842000	844000	And cooperative play.
844000	846000	And cooperative play, as well. That's right.
846000	849000	So both. You can make and play levels cooperatively.
849000	852000	You can also play competitively, racing people,
852000	855000	trying to be the first to finish.
855000	858000	Not to be that guy, but I'm going to be that guy for a moment,
858000	861000	because I do believe I said here on OLR a couple weeks ago,
861000	863000	that would be exactly a thing that you could do.
863000	866000	Race to the finish. Be ghosts with your other friends.
866000	869000	Well, of course, because how else are we going to sell you
869000	872000	on that multiplayer Nintendo online pass?
872000	875000	Well, that's a very good point.
875000	877000	That if they weren't doing that,
877000	879000	maybe there wouldn't be as much incentive to get online.
879000	882000	But I guess my assumption was that if you even want to get the levels,
882000	884000	like, if you want to download levels,
884000	887000	don't you kind of need the Nintendo online to do that?
887000	888000	Maybe, yeah.
888000	891000	I don't know if that's in front of or behind the wall.
891000	893000	I mean, I guess with a story mode,
893000	896000	and the fact that you can save all your creations locally,
896000	898000	you don't need online.
898000	902000	But, I mean, I would think you're just missing out if you don't have online.
902000	904000	So, hmm. Anyway.
904000	908000	So, yeah. I mean, honestly, the multiplayer thing
908000	911000	was, like, the only thing they needed.
911000	913000	Everything else, you know, in some ways,
913000	915000	I don't even necessarily think they needed it.
915000	918000	Just everything they talked about so far was a plus.
918000	922000	So, like, honestly, and I think I got the kind of perception from this
922000	924000	from a lot of people on social media is that
924000	927000	even if somebody maybe already owned this on Wii U
927000	930000	and was kind of like, hmm, maybe I'll get it when it goes on sale
930000	933000	or maybe I'll wait for it, which Nintendo games rarely go on sale.
933000	936000	But, you know, maybe through a retailer or come Black Friday or something.
936000	939000	But I think most people have kind of, like, upgraded
939000	941000	where it's like, oh, yeah, day one purchase.
941000	943000	There's too much shit here I can't ignore.
943000	946000	Like, between the multiplayer, which is going to make...
946000	948000	Twitch streams are going to be so fun,
948000	951000	especially if they get the co-op Twitch streaming
951000	953000	because I know that's in there for partners right now.
953000	955000	I really hope they get it in for affiliates
955000	958000	and really everybody soon because that's going to be awesome
958000	961000	if, like, say, I could team up with Bobby,
961000	964000	you know, Delvin from VG Realness, some of the other streamers that I know
964000	968000	and we could, like, race levels online.
968000	969000	I think that would be a lot of fun.
969000	972000	I pretty much already decided to get it anyway, so...
972000	973000	Oh, yeah. Well, this is...
973000	976000	And Mario Maker honestly was my favorite game of the year,
976000	979000	the year it came out, what, 2016 or whatever year it came out.
979000	982000	You know, that was like a must-have game for Wii U.
982000	987000	So I was honestly all for them just porting it over to the Switch.
987000	990000	The fact that it's going to be a step beyond that
990000	993000	just makes us, like, even, like, hype.
993000	995000	I'm hyped. Super hyped about this.
995000	998000	You got to say it right. Hype.
998000	999000	Hype.
999000	1001000	Bobby Black Wolf's in our chat because, again,
1001000	1003000	we do tape live on Sunday nights at 6 Pacific
1003000	1005000	right after Bobby Black Wolf and he's in our chat room,
1005000	1009000	which you can join us at twitch.tv slash vog network
1009000	1011000	and also at our Twitch channel.
1011000	1012000	You can check videos.
1012000	1017000	If the audio podcasts that are free through iTunes and Google Play
1017000	1018000	and all the places you find podcasts,
1018000	1020000	if the audio is not good enough for you,
1020000	1023000	you can get the video archives with a Twitch subscription
1023000	1025000	to the VOG Network channel,
1025000	1028000	which you get a free one if you're a Twitch Prime person.
1028000	1029000	So consider using it at VOG Network
1029000	1031000	and you get access to our entire video archive.
1031000	1032000	It's pretty cool.
1032000	1036000	Bobby Black Wolf says, I can't wait to lose all races.
1036000	1039000	See, he says that. He says that.
1039000	1041000	And then, like, when we play Mario Kart online,
1041000	1042000	maybe he'll lose the first one.
1042000	1043000	Aim low and exceed?
1043000	1047000	Yeah, but then he'll be, like, first place the next two races.
1047000	1049000	I don't know. I don't know what happened.
1049000	1050000	I don't know what happened.
1050000	1051000	I'm supposed to be bad at this.
1051000	1053000	Maybe you're all really bad. I don't know.
1053000	1057000	So do not be deceived when Bobby talks about his skill.
1057000	1059000	Well, he's just under-promising and over-delivering.
1059000	1060000	That's right.
1063000	1064000	Yeah, see, Bobby followed that up with,
1064000	1066000	well, maybe you are all really bad.
1066000	1067000	Yeah, that's what I thought.
1067000	1068000	That's what I thought.
1069000	1072000	Tiger Kalan Chat says, speaking of Mario Kart,
1072000	1074000	Team Sonic Racing comes out on Tuesday.
1074000	1075000	Anyone getting it?
1075000	1078000	I know we have a story referencing Sonic Racing later on,
1078000	1079000	but at a high level,
1079000	1082000	is anyone in here considering Sonic Racing?
1082000	1083000	Not really.
1083000	1085000	I think I might. Those games are fun.
1085000	1087000	I mean, the $60 price is-
1087000	1088000	I just bought a game yesterday.
1088000	1090000	I know, I know. I might.
1090000	1092000	You know, I have a flight on Wednesday,
1092000	1097000	so I'm gonna, and I bought the Tetris 99 DLC,
1097000	1099000	so I thought I might play that a little bit,
1099000	1101000	but I don't know.
1101000	1104000	I think I might be talked into playing some-
1104000	1105000	Is there Danica Patrick in it?
1105000	1107000	No, Danica Patrick is not in it this time.
1107000	1110000	Well, then, what's the point, then?
1110000	1111000	I don't know.
1111000	1113000	I'm probably gonna be looking, though,
1113000	1114000	for more gaming content
1114000	1116000	that I can play on my Mac while I'm out,
1116000	1118000	as I finally found, like, a plug-in mouse.
1118000	1119000	Yeah.
1119000	1120000	So I can actually do the stuff
1120000	1122000	like some of my other clicky games that I super like.
1122000	1124000	Well, not to get too off topic,
1124000	1126000	but at some point, that Apple Arcade thing's gonna come out,
1126000	1128000	and I would think that's gonna really
1128000	1130000	blow the lid off of Mac gaming,
1130000	1132000	and, you know, for everybody that jokes,
1132000	1133000	ha-ha, Mac gaming,
1133000	1135000	I think this is gonna be very interesting,
1135000	1139000	how Apple's gonna leverage their success with phone apps to-
1139000	1141000	Well, what people aren't realizing
1141000	1143000	is that there already were a bunch of games
1143000	1144000	coming out on Mac.
1144000	1147000	You know, people don't like to really look at the App Store,
1147000	1150000	but if you look at the App Store
1150000	1153000	and, you know, look at the gaming area,
1153000	1155000	yeah, there's some of those, like, generic ones on there,
1155000	1157000	but there were some big names,
1157000	1159000	one like Braid and Transistor and-
1159000	1162000	Every platform has zonk games.
1162000	1164000	Like, every platform has passable games.
1164000	1166000	But there were good platforming games.
1166000	1168000	There was another one I like that was,
1168000	1169000	oh, gosh, now I can't remember the name of it,
1169000	1171000	but it was a typography-based game.
1171000	1173000	I'd have to look in my installed games,
1173000	1176000	but I was playing the stew out of that for a hot minute
1176000	1178000	until I got busy.
1178000	1180000	Also, to be fair, when people do the whole, like,
1180000	1182000	ha-ha Mac games,
1182000	1184000	people will say the same thing about Xbox.
1184000	1185000	People will be like,
1185000	1187000	what's Xbox got to play?
1187000	1189000	And it's like, Xbox actually has a lot to play.
1189000	1191000	Like Halo, Forza Horizon is, like,
1191000	1194000	probably the best racing game out there, in my opinion.
1194000	1196000	I think there's elements of Forza Horizon
1196000	1198000	I enjoy more than Mario Kart, quite frankly.
1198000	1199000	So, you know-
1199000	1200000	I think it was called Typewriter.
1200000	1201000	Yeah, people are just weird.
1201000	1203000	People are going to say what they're going to say.
1203000	1205000	Oh, Pixel Pacas is agreeing with you.
1205000	1206000	Typewriter.
1206000	1207000	That was it.
1207000	1209000	That was super, super fun.
1209000	1211000	But also that other game that I liked a whole lot,
1211000	1212000	the-
1212000	1214000	Oh, God, now I can't remember the name of any of the games
1214000	1215000	I was playing that I super-
1215000	1216000	like Fractal.
1216000	1218000	Fractal make blooms, not war.
1218000	1220000	That game is pretty.
1220000	1222000	And the music is great in it.
1222000	1224000	It looks more of an ambient thing,
1224000	1226000	but it's a highly addictive game,
1226000	1229000	and I really wish that had taken off a lot better with other people.
1229000	1230000	Yeah.
1230000	1231000	Anyway, I do want to mention,
1231000	1233000	before we get into our gaming weeks
1233000	1234000	and move on with the rest of the show, though,
1234000	1237000	there was kind of like a follow-up to this as well.
1237000	1239000	Something to do with, I guess,
1239000	1241000	a way to entice more people to jump in
1241000	1244000	and buy this game on the first day, right, Loki?
1244000	1247000	Yeah, since we don't do discounts,
1247000	1253000	but you can buy this thing that's like a ticket to two games,
1253000	1255000	and it's only $99.99,
1255000	1258000	so you're really saving $10 on each game.
1258000	1261000	Well, potentially saving $10 on each game
1261000	1265000	because some of the games it includes are already $50,
1265000	1269000	so no savings there, but you-
1269000	1272000	You have to really strategically plan out what you're going to buy.
1272000	1276000	Yeah, you have to pick two $60 games if you want to save some money,
1276000	1278000	and so you can use that.
1278000	1280000	They said, well, you can use it for Zelda,
1280000	1282000	and you can pre-order Mario Maker 2.
1282000	1283000	I already have Zelda.
1283000	1284000	Exactly, I already have Zelda 2.
1284000	1287000	So are they going to extend it to any other future releases?
1287000	1290000	Can I hang onto it when Animal Crossing comes out,
1290000	1292000	or is it something where I have to use it by a certain day?
1292000	1295000	Well, you have to use it, I think, within a year.
1295000	1297000	Okay, so there's a good chance
1297000	1300000	that Animal Crossing will be a holiday game,
1300000	1304000	and so if I buy that now, I can kind of sit on it and use it for Animal Crossing,
1304000	1308000	but at the same time, that means I'm dropping 50 bucks for Animal Crossing
1308000	1311000	six months in advance or so, right?
1311000	1313000	Yes.
1313000	1314000	That's what I thought.
1314000	1317000	Although, granted, I'm super more excited about Animal Crossing
1317000	1319000	than I am about Mario Maker.
1319000	1321000	Everybody's got their different things that they're hyped about.
1321000	1323000	I understand, so-
1323000	1325000	And wait till after E3.
1325000	1327000	If you can believe it, so we're not here next week.
1327000	1329000	OLR is going to be off for the Memorial Day weekend
1329000	1332000	because both Dark Sakura and myself are going to be out of town at different events,
1332000	1334000	so we've been saying that for weeks now,
1334000	1336000	so we're not going to be here next week.
1336000	1340000	When we come back that Sunday, that's the week leading into E3.
1340000	1344000	It's not the night that press conferences just straight-up interrupt our show,
1344000	1348000	but it's the week before, so I would say we're about what?
1348000	1349000	So that's one, two, three.
1349000	1354000	We're three weeks away, Dark Sakura, from knowing about Animal Crossing,
1354000	1356000	assuming that is Nintendo's big reveal this year.
1356000	1358000	I have my pre-order.
1358000	1364000	I actually went to the Game Stops because, what was I buying?
1364000	1366000	I was buying something at the time.
1366000	1368000	Oh, yeah, I was buying Dan's Red Dead for his birthday,
1368000	1372000	so this was back in November, and I was just talking about Animal Crossing.
1372000	1374000	We've got pre-orders for it.
1374000	1375000	I'm like, yeah, what's your release date?
1375000	1377000	Laugh, laugh, January.
1377000	1378000	I'm like, yeah, that's not going to happen.
1378000	1379000	I don't know.
1379000	1383000	Bobby's razzing you for caving in and using the word pre-order.
1384000	1386000	Well, whatever.
1386000	1389000	At some point, it's what the industry calls it.
1389000	1390000	You just have to accept it.
1390000	1391000	It's a pre-purchase.
1391000	1392000	I'm quoting.
1392000	1393000	Yeah, you're quoting.
1393000	1394000	I'm quoting.
1394000	1395000	Okay.
1395000	1401000	That's why she's saying sick under her breath after a sick, sick.
1401000	1404000	I prefer when they called it reservations.
1404000	1406000	Well, if you want to be technical about it, okay?
1406000	1408000	I don't. I really don't.
1408000	1411000	We're just going to make it so that it's correct, okay?
1411000	1412000	Okay, George Carlin.
1412000	1418000	So a pre-order is you're placing the order before the store actually places the order with the publisher.
1418000	1421000	So technically, you're ordering it before they order it.
1421000	1423000	So it is a pre-order.
1423000	1425000	The order is coming in before they order it.
1425000	1430000	No, because you are putting in the order and they are forwarding the order.
1430000	1432000	So if anything, it would be a forwarded order.
1432000	1434000	I was trying to help you out here, but fine.
1434000	1435000	No.
1435000	1436000	You know what?
1436000	1437000	You're wrong.
1437000	1439000	I'm the semantics queen.
1439000	1440000	At any rate.
1440000	1443000	If we preempt this conversation to talk about literally anything else.
1443000	1445000	I prefer reservation.
1445000	1447000	I have reservations about this show right now.
1447000	1449000	Moving on.
1449000	1450000	Girl.
1450000	1454000	We are going to get into a segment talking about our gaming weeks.
1454000	1458000	So let's talk a little bit about what types of games we have been playing this week.
1458000	1461000	And I think we can all grammatically agree with that statement.
1461000	1463000	How is your gaming week, Dark Sakura?
1463000	1464000	What have you been playing?
1464000	1465000	Good lord.
1465000	1466000	All right.
1466000	1469000	I have to look at my phone because I took pictures of everything I played.
1469000	1470000	Okay.
1470000	1471000	We don't have to have the entire laundry list.
1471000	1472000	Yes, I do.
1472000	1474000	Because most people out there are going to be like, I don't know these tables.
1474000	1475000	Yes, I do.
1475000	1476000	You played a lot of pinball.
1476000	1478000	I played Black Knight Sword of Rage.
1478000	1481000	Well, I am going to talk about the notable ones.
1481000	1482000	They had a Pac-Man pinball.
1482000	1485000	They're not baby Pac-Man, but the Pac-Man table.
1485000	1486000	Oh, yeah.
1486000	1487000	I've seen the Pac-Man table.
1487000	1488000	Oh, man.
1488000	1489000	They didn't have a baby Pac-Man, though.
1489000	1490000	That's my favorite.
1490000	1496000	They had the Beatlemania table, which is a remake of a 60s pinball, but with modern tools
1496000	1501000	like magnetic catches and different triggers and different story modes and everything in
1501000	1502000	the full video display.
1502000	1504000	It was really cool.
1504000	1506000	I had no idea they made a pinball table out of the Beatles.
1506000	1511000	Well, there was the old one back in the day, but yeah, this one's a remake of the old one.
1511000	1516000	I played one called Fire, which is basically just a town on fire.
1516000	1523000	I played Ripley's Believe It or Not, but the best one ever was this one called Nightmoves.
1523000	1529000	The music is like 1982 threw up all over everything, and the display is right in the middle of it.
1529000	1530000	It's this flat one.
1530000	1532000	They also had the joust, which is the versus.
1532000	1534000	They did a joust pinball machine?
1534000	1538000	Yeah, and I'm going to see if, again, anyone can see that.
1538000	1539000	Your phone pictures don't go very well.
1539000	1545000	Yeah, but anyway, it is a slanted table.
1545000	1547000	You see this chat?
1547000	1548000	Yeah.
1549000	1556000	It's upraised in the center, but you play and you kick the balls back and forth.
1556000	1560000	Kind of, I guess, like skee-ballish versus, you know.
1560000	1563000	I played a bunch of the super old ones.
1563000	1569000	I was kind of actually disappointed not to find a Captain Fantastic, but I did play Willy Wonka
1569000	1575000	in the Chocolate Factory, but like I said leading up from Bobby is that they had it
1575000	1580000	for two balls per play and no ball save.
1580000	1584000	The games were over really quick unless you just were really amazing at it.
1584000	1586000	But you weren't having to actually pay money to play all these games, right?
1586000	1587000	No.
1587000	1588000	They were all in free play anyway.
1588000	1590000	They were all in free play.
1590000	1593000	I played a little Deadpool.
1593000	1594000	I still think Deadpool is great.
1594000	1598000	My husband's not as big of a fan of it, but one thing that made me happy is that they
1598000	1602000	actually had a Black Knight, a Black Knight 2000, and a Black Knight Sword of Rage all
1602000	1603000	by each other.
1603000	1604000	So I had to go through.
1604000	1605000	Now the Big Lebowski.
1605000	1606000	They had a Big Lebowski there.
1606000	1609000	And I don't know if you know about the drama of this.
1609000	1613000	It was a company created and they were going to do the Big Lebowski table.
1613000	1615000	And it's a really nice table.
1615000	1621000	They had enough orders to do like five or six hundred of them and only produced 300
1621000	1622000	tables.
1622000	1624000	So yeah, people were pissed.
1624000	1628000	But that also means that this table is like super rare.
1628000	1632000	So, I mean, maybe not as rare as Big Bang Bar was, you know, back in the day.
1632000	1633000	But it was pretty rare.
1633000	1634000	It was really fun, too.
1634000	1637000	You know, and I played a Tron.
1637000	1638000	I love the Tron table.
1638000	1640000	It's so pretty.
1640000	1641000	It's Tron Legacy, technically.
1641000	1642000	Tron Legacy, yeah.
1642000	1646000	And they had a Houdini, which I finally got a chance to play Houdini.
1646000	1647000	And it's OK.
1647000	1650000	They did another one, the same company.
1650000	1651000	It's crap.
1651000	1653000	It's not Jersey Jack because Jersey Jack did.
1653000	1656000	No, it's American Pinball Company, one of the newer ones.
1656000	1661000	But they did Houdini and then they did a new one, which is Oktoberfest, which I wasn't
1661000	1662000	too into playing.
1662000	1669000	You know, it had like just this big, you know, theme of beer, which I have no problem with.
1669000	1674000	And then, you know, I went that was on Friday when I went back.
1674000	1678000	I have a lot of pictures of Miss Vanjie and Brooklyn Heights.
1678000	1679000	Is she there?
1679000	1680000	I had to go through my phone.
1680000	1681000	No.
1681000	1682000	Was she there?
1682000	1683000	No, just because they're beautiful.
1683000	1689000	So I also played Space Shuttle, which is kind of one of those middle era ones.
1689000	1690000	Strange Science.
1690000	1691000	Rocky and Bull Inkel.
1691000	1692000	They had a Rocky and Bull Inkel.
1692000	1693000	You know, I used to own one.
1693000	1694000	Yeah, yeah.
1694000	1695000	I remember playing that table at your house.
1695000	1696000	Strange Science.
1696000	1697000	Is that like a knockoff weird science?
1697000	1700000	I think it actually predates weird science.
1700000	1703000	But it's kind of different themed.
1703000	1706000	It doesn't have like the make a girl in your garage thing, you know.
1706000	1710000	But Rocky and Bull Inkel, for those who don't know, this was actually one of the first pinballs
1710000	1712000	Dan and I owned.
1712000	1714000	And it has an Easter egg in it.
1714000	1722000	If you look by where Mr. Peabody is standing by the Wayback Machine, there's a DeLorean
1722000	1724000	coming out from it behind him.
1724000	1727000	So, you know, little things are there.
1727000	1731000	There's Roller Games played Wizard of Oz, which is another one of those Jersey Jack
1731000	1732000	tables.
1732000	1733000	So is Wonka.
1733000	1734000	Wonka's one of the Jersey Jack tables.
1734000	1739000	I think Beatlemania was also, no, it wasn't reproduced by Jersey Jack.
1739000	1742000	You know, they had Cyclone and some of those other ones.
1742000	1745000	That's America's Most Haunted, which I think was the only one done by that.
1745000	1748000	They had a dialed in, which is, of course, another Jersey Jack.
1748000	1751000	The Jersey Jack tables are pricey, but they also had the Munsters.
1751000	1754000	Did you know that that had been a recent one?
1754000	1757000	You had mentioned it at like whatever the last pinball thing was that you went to.
1757000	1758000	They didn't have it.
1758000	1759000	It wasn't out then.
1759000	1760000	I remember.
1760000	1761000	I remember hearing about it.
1761000	1764000	Oh, you know, I have a friend on Facebook who's super into pinball as well.
1764000	1768000	So I knew from my Rocky horror days in San Francisco, she's super into pinball, too.
1768000	1770000	So I think maybe she had posted about it.
1770000	1772000	She's probably at the same show, to be quite honest.
1772000	1773000	Okay.
1773000	1779000	Well, one of the neat things, though, about Munsters pinball is that you can get like Grandpa's lab as a mode.
1779000	1786000	And there is this kind of oval shaped insert in the bottom of it with teeny, teeny, teeny pinball.
1786000	1792000	Like the flippers are like a third the size of the normal flipper in the balls, like a little teeny, teeny pinball.
1792000	1795000	And you've got like traps and catches and stuff in there.
1795000	1797000	It's actually super fun.
1797000	1799000	It's adorable.
1799000	1802000	But, you know, those were really the big names there.
1802000	1803000	Of course, you know, I played the Black Rose.
1803000	1808000	I think I played, though, that Knight moves a crap ton just because the music was so enamoring.
1808000	1813000	But the other thing for me, there was an Avatar, which is not fun.
1813000	1814000	Elvis, not fun.
1814000	1817000	Star Wars, pretty fun, because that's also one of Steve Ritchie's.
1817000	1819000	But I had to play roller games because that's an early Steve Ritchie.
1819000	1821000	And, of course, all the Black Knights.
1821000	1823000	There's the X-Men pinball, which is okay.
1823000	1827000	Now, here is me getting into some gripes about some of the newer ones.
1827000	1832000	I really want to love the is it P3 or P4?
1832000	1833000	I have to look at the name again.
1833000	1838000	They're modular tables, so they're meant that you they have a big video screen on the play field.
1838000	1846000	And then you put in different ramps and different arrangements based on what game you're going to have loaded on the on the ROM board.
1846000	1849000	And so Lexi Light Speed was their first one.
1849000	1850000	And it's fun.
1850000	1855000	You know, it's got like a carousel thing to catch your balls from multiball.
1855000	1857000	And you can have, I think, like a 10 multiball thing.
1857000	1859000	It's pretty intense.
1859000	1860000	It was really fun.
1860000	1863000	But this other one that was called.
1863000	1865000	I have to get the name of it.
1865000	1866000	Cannon Lagoon.
1866000	1867000	It's stupid.
1867000	1872000	I mean, it's like two ramps and three targets and a video screen in the background.
1872000	1876000	And all you do is just try to throw the cannonball at a ship.
1876000	1877000	It's boring.
1877000	1883000	And like you have like so many balls that balls that you can throw at them.
1883000	1886000	So really, I wasn't.
1886000	1891000	That was probably the least the most disappointing thing I played was that one.
1891000	1893000	But I mean, I love monsters.
1893000	1894000	Black Knight.
1894000	1895000	Oh, my God.
1895000	1899000	I think I I might have lost my shit a couple of times playing it.
1899000	1900000	Is it only pinball at this?
1900000	1906000	I know it might sound like a stupid question, but I know when I went to the Pinball Hall of Fame Museum in Vegas, they had some 80s arcade games, too.
1906000	1910000	So is it only pinball at this or did you get to play some like old school arcade games?
1910000	1914000	There was one arcade game and it was a Donkey Kong.
1914000	1915000	Random.
1915000	1916000	Yeah.
1916000	1917000	Maybe somebody was trying to set a new high score.
1917000	1918000	Who knows?
1918000	1923000	But I I had to, of course, show my own doctor who some love.
1923000	1926000	And I went over and it was my baby.
1926000	1929000	You know, I just got to play a lot of stuff I don't normally get to see.
1929000	1934000	And I checked out some stuff that I had seen before and never actually played.
1934000	1936000	And I really tried to give some love to the old pinballs.
1936000	1939000	And, you know, they're simple.
1939000	1942000	But they can be a fun little challenge, too.
1942000	1947000	You know, I got to play a wood rail pinball like from the 50s.
1947000	1948000	Oh, wow.
1948000	1957000	And you know, it makes them wood rails that the you know, you normally have that metal bit on the side, you know, but these were wood and they were really fun.
1957000	1959000	They have quite a different feel to it.
1959000	1963000	You know, I tilted Black Knight.
1963000	1967000	It has the best tilt, like tilt warning.
1967000	1970000	And it's the knight with his fist in the air and it says danger.
1970000	1975000	And I'm like, OK, that's going to be my warning symbol for everybody is the Black Knight going danger.
1975000	1982000	Was that that's the sound of our show going to turn off its thunder nearby, because there's like a airport.
1982000	1983000	It's dragons.
1983000	1985000	But it's not right.
1985000	1987000	It's not it's not like a commercial airport.
1987000	1989000	It's like a UPS and that type of airport.
1989000	1990000	Oh, yeah.
1990000	1991000	No, it's not that.
1991000	1998000	Dude, Y Y R says a friend of his actually works I.T. for Jersey Jack Pinball hook a girl up.
1998000	2001000	Tell him to send me some swag. Tell him to be my friend.
2001000	2003000	All right. No, not just because, but I actually want to talk.
2003000	2009000	I've tried to make friends with as many people that I know who work in pinball just because I love it so much.
2009000	2013000	I want to learn more of, you know, how these machines come about.
2013000	2018000	I was so mad that I missed the making of the Deadpool because they also had like another building with instructionals.
2018000	2022000	And, you know, different, you know, like meet this designer, learn this.
2022000	2025000	And I was so mad I missed the making of the Deadpool pinball.
2025000	2030000	I'm really interested in the America's most haunted because that was the table that Ben had created.
2030000	2037000	And he actually has it's like an open source table where you can actually get all the software that runs it and everything to build your own tables,
2037000	2041000	which America's most haunted is actually super fun.
2041000	2044000	It's got like just all the modes in it are really fun.
2044000	2047000	The targets are fun. The theming is fun.
2047000	2054000	I like anything that uses magnets, which is why I really like the X-Men game because it's Magneto is your enemy.
2054000	2057000	Magnets. How do they work?
2057000	2062000	Anyway, but in that one, it has like a mode where it's like the big Magneto fight mode.
2062000	2068000	And there's magnets under the play field that will activate at different times and switch your ball in a different direction.
2068000	2075000	But this one thing I liked about America's most haunted is that there is like a mode where you attack the ghosts and you have to knock down a wall first.
2075000	2081000	And then you have to go in and hit the ghost inside this little cylinder so many times before it'll catch your ball.
2081000	2084000	And, you know, that's one of the various modes in it.
2084000	2087000	It's it's it's a good table. It's really a lot of fun.
2087000	2091000	Anything for your gaming week outside of this pinball expo that you want to mention?
2091000	2096000	I ain't played shit. No, I'm kidding. I pokey manned.
2096000	2099000	I idle pouring.
2099000	2103000	Oh, and Animal Crossing because I can't get enough.
2103000	2107000	She can't be stopped during this king gyroids. All right.
2107000	2111000	Well, we'll move on to Loki. I know you probably didn't play pinball this week, but I didn't play pinball this week.
2111000	2120000	I did. I did play a few things. So I did purchase and play a little bit of Miami Shakedown, which is when you were streaming a little bit.
2120000	2131000	It was the one I was streaming and lost all my progress after I was done with it because I got in this weird glitch that put my game in like this weird state where I was dead and alive at the same time.
2131000	2138000	And so I was like, oh, crap, you know, better save my game to see if I can, you know, at least restart it and save my progress.
2138000	2142000	And it corrupted the save. So I lost five hours. Yeah, that's fine.
2142000	2147000	It's a fun game. But yeah, it's like the sequel to Retro City Rampage almost.
2147000	2153000	And the whole premise of it is that you're this guy who kind of run this runs this company.
2153000	2158000	And so now you're basically doing all the things that like all the predatory things that all the other companies are normally doing.
2158000	2169000	Like, you know, click bait ads, you know, selling gift cards that no one's going to redeem or just like all sorts of crazy stuff.
2169000	2176000	And you're, you know, at the same time also murdering people and all that because it's fun and it's ridiculous.
2176000	2181000	So, yeah, it's a really fun game. So I played that quite a bit.
2181000	2185000	And then I went over to strikes finally because I've never been there.
2185000	2197000	So I played Dance Maniacs, not the Dance Maniacs Konami made, but Dance Maniacs, the actual dancing game, the five.
2197000	2203000	It's it's the one that's by, I want to say, Kyle Ward or whatever. Oh, oh, they have one of those.
2203000	2208000	Yeah. Dance Maniacs, I guess, is what it is. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Isn't it Step Maniacs?
2208000	2212000	Step Maniacs. Sorry, not Dance Maniacs. Step Maniacs. Yeah, that's Kyle's new project.
2212000	2217000	Yes. So they have one there. Yeah. So I played that a bit and I had.
2217000	2221000	Well, first off, I didn't really know what songs to play. So I, I did.
2221000	2226000	I did recognize there was a Dream of Dream was on there or one of the Captain Jack songs that was on there.
2226000	2229000	They got some licenses. You know, he was he was there.
2229000	2233000	Even the guys he works with are always pretty sad about that was like getting DDR adjacent stuff.
2233000	2241000	Yeah. So while I like the game because it's fun in the middle, I'm still getting used to the middle step thing being there.
2242000	2245000	What I don't enjoy is the in-the-grooveness of it.
2245000	2251000	And by in-the-grooveness, I mean that more than two arrows at the same time type of bullshit.
2251000	2256000	You know, where you have to do knee drops and shit. I'm like, fuck that shit.
2256000	2259000	You can't just disable that type of stuff? You might be able to.
2259000	2262000	But I didn't know really what I did. I just. But that was the last song.
2262000	2266000	The step art. Yeah. Okay. So like I kept ramping it up a little bit.
2266000	2269000	Did you like the touch screen for it? The touch screen is pretty cool. Yeah.
2269000	2272000	I was like, oh, that's pretty smart. Making like a tablet style.
2272000	2276000	Yeah. Yeah. I like the game overall and I'm sure it appeals to other people.
2276000	2281000	I just I didn't like that particular thing. Just, you know, the three arrows at a time.
2281000	2285000	I know that's something that's pretty popular with like Pump It Up and stuff like that.
2285000	2288000	That new generation of Bomani. Them kids.
2288000	2294000	I'm just too old to do knee drops and shit. And so it's just I'm not doing that.
2294000	2298000	But it was fun otherwise. Really fun game. So I did enjoy that.
2298000	2301000	I was going to play DDR, but DDR was off at the moment.
2301000	2307000	They had an integral of three, but some dumb ass was storing their toolbox on the the stage.
2307000	2310000	So I don't know who the fuck had that shit. Oh, I would have moved it.
2310000	2313000	I ain't shy. I would have moved. Yeah, I should have. But they had.
2313000	2317000	It's an integral three step mania cabinet, basically.
2317000	2322000	So they had that set up there. I don't know why they didn't just put it on the supernova because the supernova is off.
2322000	2326000	So I didn't end up playing that stuff, but I wanted to. My kids are whining, too.
2326000	2333000	So I didn't want to do it. I did get the play, though, Neon FM. And so that was fun.
2333000	2335000	I love Neon FM. I want to go back and play that again.
2335000	2341000	So I did play because the first time I played it, I was going, but like now I'm like, I'm like, this is like the American pop music.
2341000	2345000	I'm told. Yeah, sort of. Yeah. And they have like a poppin right next to is kind of fun.
2345000	2348000	So it's been a little while since I've been over there. They didn't have a poppin.
2348000	2352000	Yeah, they have a poppin now. They still have sound voltex. They still have sound voltex.
2352000	2358000	You beat? Maybe? I don't know. But they have a sound voltex.
2358000	2364000	They they have a poppin. So I thought about they get 2DX yet.
2364000	2369000	That's no no 2DX. All right. I mean, maybe they can replace the shooting gallery that's in there.
2369000	2375000	But, you know, put 2DX in there. No, but I did play play that.
2375000	2378000	And of course, I had to play girls butts. So I did play that.
2378000	2386000	And then for those that don't understand the reference is this old song like we've been talking about the song like it when it was like 15 years ago.
2386000	2391000	This was in this neon that it was like being conceived like 15 years ago.
2391000	2396000	And they released some songs from it. This is one of the songs we always Thomas Howard Litchin horrible.
2396000	2401000	This song. It's it's a horrible song. Careful that Mike's hot.
2401000	2407000	I think you're being in Stein. Yeah. But here's the thing is that the game is great.
2407000	2412000	I just said what a fan I am. That one song is terrible. It's terrible.
2412000	2416000	It's awesome. Whatever. Yeah, that game is fun, too.
2416000	2419000	I'm not very good. See, once again, I don't really understand their rankings on there.
2419000	2423000	So I was like, OK, well, this wasn't that hard.
2423000	2428000	Let me step it up to this. And they just like it was really hard, like really fast.
2428000	2433000	And I'm just not very good at like, you know, I'm not very good at pop music connectivity with the phone.
2433000	2436000	And, you know, no, I mean, that's still a thing. It is still a thing.
2436000	2440000	You can stick your codes. So I was just like, yeah, I don't need to do it.
2440000	2447000	But it was fun. So I played that when I do it. A little picture of Alyssa Edwards comes up because that's my avatar.
2447000	2454000	And then various other arcade games always play the Jurassic Park because it's my youngest son's favorite game.
2454000	2461000	So we always play that. And this is Rob Roberts secret.
2461000	2468000	But yeah, the only complaint I have about that arcade is the prices are so expensive, like not so much the music games.
2468000	2471000	The music games are fine, but like my kids don't play the music games.
2471000	2481000	They play the redemption games and like that stupid crossy roads thing, which like you die like in three seconds is a buck each time you play.
2481000	2485000	That's a little ridiculous, but whatever. That's what it is.
2485000	2490000	And I tried to tell them, do you really want to play this or you want to play this game that you could race a whole race on?
2490000	2495000	I want to play this game. OK, fine. Interesting, though, about the price stuff, because Locopoco is reminding us in chat.
2495000	2499000	I can't wait for Roseville to get around one. That's another suburb in the area we live in.
2499000	2503000	And that's not far at all from strikes. It's going to be interesting when that round one opens up.
2503000	2507000	It's pretty far away. I guess it's a pretty deep way, but pretty good.
2507000	2511000	It's a definite schlep for me. Yeah, I mean, for me, they're both far away.
2511000	2516000	But yeah, I mean, but I will still patronize it.
2516000	2521000	I will still go and spend my money there to support having around one that maybe that will get one out in my neighborhood.
2521000	2526000	Yeah. The power says for people who have played me on FM Arcade, how much did your arcade charge per song?
2526000	2529000	It was a dollar. It was a dollar for three. Yeah.
2529000	2534000	But it's one of those things where like didn't have like a sliding scale for it because it uses a card.
2534000	2538000	And like if you put more money in the cards, you get more points, right?
2538000	2542000	No, this isn't points. It's actual money. So it's actual dollars.
2542000	2547000	It's not like one of those ones where it's 60 points and you have to try to calculate the math and everything.
2547000	2550000	And it's a dollar for three songs. Yeah, it's a dollar for three songs.
2550000	2554000	And so that was OK. And the same for the Step Maniacs.
2554000	2558000	I think that was a dollar, a dollar fifty for three songs.
2558000	2560000	But that was most of the games.
2560000	2566000	New music games, usually those are usually the ones that are the more expensive games, but they weren't here.
2566000	2571000	It's just all the redemption games are really expensive. Loki, this show is also 17 years old.
2571000	2577000	Prices have gone up. I understand that. I understand that prices would go up in general,
2577000	2581000	but you would think that those I guess those games don't have as much of a draw anymore.
2581000	2585000	But then why shove your arcade full of them if that's the case? I mean, whatever.
2585000	2590000	I think that place gets really full on like Friday and Saturday. I know there's there's a hardcore crowd,
2590000	2592000	which is funny because it's like, you know, back in the day, that was our scene.
2592000	2595000	Those are our people. Not to say they're not our people, but you know what I mean?
2595000	2599000	Like back in the day, that was us hanging out. Yeah. You know, and now now I'm like,
2599000	2605000	what mixed number are they on a beat me now? I lost count. You know, it's it's a pretty decent arcade.
2605000	2611000	I would definitely go back and play some stuff. Just not with my kids because, you know, they whine too much.
2611000	2615000	All right. So that's it. Oh, and Pokemon Go. OK. My gaming week.
2615000	2621000	So I've been pretty busy playing a variety of different games. Diablo three started season 17.
2621000	2626000	So I got yes, season 17. And I got in on that playing a little bit of that.
2626000	2633000	Trying to nobody's power leveling me. Boo hoo. But I think I've gotten my wizard up to like 40 by myself.
2633000	2639000	So I'll probably keep working on that at least till I get level 70. Get my pity set for the season and some of the achievements.
2639000	2642000	That would that would be nice. That'd be fun. And then I've been playing Heroes of the Storm.
2642000	2646000	I mentioned last week I was back on my bullshit with that game. So I'm continuing my bullshit this week.
2646000	2650000	I'm going to play with you on that one because I'm considering playing it again. Oh, yeah.
2650000	2657000	I only play matches, but sure. Actually, I did one match with the real people this week.
2657000	2665000	I played white main as one of the newer healer characters that I played in a real people match and it went horrifically.
2665000	2671000	So that would be my last player versus player match. It was Spike and a couple others.
2671000	2676000	No fun. This is a few a couple of years ago, but I don't remember.
2676000	2680000	And it was a lot of fun. We have friends the game. Yeah. The game hasn't changed that much.
2680000	2685000	Well, I say that actually it's changed a lot. But like the look and feel hasn't really changed.
2685000	2689000	I mean, some of the mechanics have been balanced out over time and there's a lot more characters.
2689000	2693000	But, you know, the base concepts and things haven't changed significantly.
2693000	2697000	So let's see. Other stuff that I played this week continuing on with Final Fantasy 14.
2697000	2703000	Haven't played that a lot since we're really in that pre-expansion lull because there's a new expansion looming at the end of June.
2703000	2707000	So there's not a lot to do right now, but soon there will be more.
2707000	2709000	And then some other stuff I don't usually talk about.
2709000	2717000	I played some Tetris 99 this week because they had that event going on where you could get the special Game Boy skin if you got enough points.
2717000	2725000	And some of it was rough because I was getting like four points or seven points at a time because I would come in like one match.
2725000	2730000	I was like 62nd place. Another match. I was like, you know, maybe like 31.
2730000	2735000	You get like you get more respectable showing when you get the higher you get. Have you ever won any?
2735000	2742000	I have never won one. Sadly, the highest I got, I got my highest placement with the very last match because he gave me all the points I needed.
2742000	2745000	I got sixth place in a match. So it was very...
2745000	2746000	That's respectable.
2746000	2754000	Here's the thing that fucks me up on Tetris 99. I do fine normally, but it's when the pieces start dropping like crazy.
2754000	2766000	And the switch controller, especially if you're playing like with the controllers docked on the system, which is how I, you know, so I can play like lying on the couch or whatever.
2766000	2769000	I can play 99 that way. It really doesn't control well.
2769000	2773000	I really don't like controlling it that way because you have to use those little buttons.
2773000	2777000	You can't use the L stick because the L stick is for like targeting and stuff.
2777000	2782000	So I just I really don't like playing that way. It's a lot better on a pro controller.
2782000	2787000	But even then, yeah, that's my one complaint is that just it doesn't control perfection.
2787000	2791000	So when the pieces start dropping really fast, I lose it.
2791000	2794000	Like I just I can't I'm fucking up left and right putting bricks where they shouldn't be.
2794000	2797000	And I just so I can't handle the speed when it gets that fast.
2797000	2801000	So why we are in chat says, damn, I forgot about the event. It's already over.
2801000	2806000	No, you have until eleven fifty nine Pacific tonight. So get on it.
2806000	2809000	Yeah. Get on it. You have two hours.
2809000	2812000	The nice thing is no. Eleven fifty nine Pacific.
2812000	2816000	I said this. Oh yeah. Pacific. So you have about five hours.
2816000	2821000	Wait. No specific time. It's only 650. I'm sorry. I was the words.
2821000	2824000	It's fine. So anyway, I will say this.
2824000	2831000	The nice thing is you get to kind of preview the skin because the tournament is played on that Gameboy skin that you're basically working to earn.
2831000	2840000	So, you know, at least play one or two matches so you can see it because maybe you'll play it and be like, eh, the skin isn't that good.
2840000	2844000	And that would be fine as well. So up to you.
2844000	2847000	Let's see. What else did I play? Oh, real quick. I got one other.
2847000	2851000	So I bought the Castlevania collection on PlayStation four. Yeah, because I came out on Tuesday.
2851000	2854000	So I only played old school Castlevania.
2854000	2862000	But yeah, it's old school Castlevania with, you know, one safe state that you can save and load if you want.
2862000	2866000	Although back in my day, we didn't have safe states. You had to play through the whole game or you were trash.
2866000	2873000	So I want to see if I can at least get back up to level five in the Grim Reaper boss because stage five has the best music.
2873000	2877000	And like probably like any. I don't know, because some of the music in Simon's Quest is so amazing.
2877000	2881000	But at least in Castlevania one, stage five is like my favorite song of the whole game.
2881000	2885000	So I want to get back to that to hear that again. Yeah. So I was having fun.
2885000	2890000	I guess Konami did an all right job with it like they they didn't fuck it up completely.
2890000	2893000	So let's let's. Hello. Let's celebrate that. Hurray.
2893000	2897000	You emulated the game. Well, you did a thing.
2897000	2900000	You did a thing that everybody's been doing for several decades now.
2900000	2908000	So, yeah, I'm hearing that they're going to release the Japanese versions as like an add on a free patch thing later on.
2908000	2914000	So that if you want to play Castlevania three with like the bonus Famicom disc music set,
2914000	2917000	I think it might have been something that was actually in the cartridge. I don't remember how that worked.
2917000	2920000	But there was like just an extra some extra tones in Japan.
2920000	2924000	So we'll be able to actually play that version soon, too, although they didn't date that.
2924000	2927000	So we don't know when. But that's something that's coming, which is pretty exciting.
2927000	2932000	So. Hurray. So. All right. Let's see.
2932000	2936000	Dark, dark to see in chat says M2 killed it with this collection, in my opinion.
2936000	2939000	You can hear the better music on the main menu. That is true.
2939000	2944000	You can hear that music right away while you're picking because it does have your basic menu that, you know, you can pick a game.
2944000	2949000	It has like a manual, like a virtual manual that you can look through online.
2949000	2953000	You know, some of some of the things that like collections do these days is it's cute.
2953000	2960000	You know, again, they they did a thing. I'm sure it's I in some ways I kind of wish I hadn't bought it on PlayStation 4.
2960000	2963000	I don't know why I did. I was like, oh, trophies, television. I don't know.
2963000	2965000	I haven't bought anything on PlayStation 4 in a while. Let's do that.
2965000	2969000	I wish I'd bought it on the Switch because then I could pick it up and take it with me.
2969000	2974000	And I bet the collection is great on Switch. But oh, well, so much for that anyway.
2974000	2978000	So that was my gaming week. OK, sorry. I know it was a lot, but I had a busy week with gaming.
2978000	2982000	That's good. We you know, sometimes we like to play video games around here, believe it or not.
2982000	2986000	But let's get into some gaming news, some quick housekeeping.
2986000	2989000	One more time, I will say it. We're not going to be here next week.
2989000	2992000	Dark Sakura is going to Southern California. She's going to Drag Con.
2992000	2996000	Yeah. So she can meet Miss Vanjie. Honestly. Yeah. Yeah.
2996000	3000000	And what are I met Alexis Mateo last year. Quickly.
3000000	3004000	This isn't a Drag Race podcast and Loki's going to internally scream if we go too far off the rails.
3004000	3008000	But your top three queens you want to meet at Drag Con. Top three.
3008000	3014000	This is Cracker again. OK. Trixie. Uh huh. Not Trixie. Katja. OK. Katja better. Sorry.
3014000	3020000	Wow. Wig. And I don't know. I want to see Mayhem again.
3020000	3027000	I really liked Mayhem. She's a sweetheart. Yeah. I want to find out what the hell's up with Soju.
3027000	3030000	Soju's really the stepped up the game since Drag Race already.
3030000	3034000	The good news is, too, Mayhem comes up here locally a lot. All right. But anyway, we're not going to derail.
3034000	3037000	I'm also going to be going to Mickey's, but I don't think Mayhem's hosting that night.
3037000	3041000	So you're going to Drag Con. You're going to some drag events affiliated with Drag Con.
3041000	3044000	I want to see Bible Girl again if she's there. I'd really like Madeline Hatter to come.
3044000	3046000	You're going to do some other non drag things, though, too, right?
3046000	3053000	Yes. I'm going to San Diego to visit with some sister friends and hopefully go to Extraordinary Desserts,
3053000	3057000	which I haven't been to in like 12 years. Amazing.
3057000	3064000	And then back up and going to Disneyland on Tuesday, maybe by myself.
3064000	3068000	Disney will be fine. Call Aria Snark. Well, she's probably working.
3068000	3072000	Aria Snark will be like, oh, it's a day ending in Y. Let's go to Disneyland.
3072000	3080000	Well, I'm going to say this. My thing about going to Disneyland by myself is every other time I have ever gone to Disneyland,
3080000	3086000	there have been other people with me and I either have to slow down to other people's pace or catch up to other people's pace.
3086000	3091000	And if my feet hurt, you know, I feel guilty about sitting down by myself.
3092000	3099000	You know, I may have another mutual friend of ours meet there. Maybe Renee.
3099000	3100000	Yay.
3100000	3105000	But if not, I'm not at anything. It's a day at my pace.
3105000	3109000	I totally respect that. You know, I had an ex who was really into Disneyland.
3109000	3112000	You probably know him talk about before I was with Alan. So it was a while ago, right?
3112000	3113000	Because I've been with Alan for almost a decade now.
3113000	3120000	But my ex right before Alan was super into Disney and used to go by himself to Disneyland.
3120000	3122000	And at first I was kind of like, you go to Disneyland by yourself.
3122000	3126000	But then when I kind of like heard more about it, I was like, because he really he loved to people watch.
3126000	3131000	He said the people watching Disneyland is better than any other place on the planet for people watching.
3131000	3132000	And I believe it.
3132000	3134000	I think I want to take my legit Polaroid with me.
3134000	3135000	Yeah.
3135000	3138000	And just take Polaroids of scenes at Disneyland.
3138000	3142000	But, you know, the other thing, too, is it's also going to be my first attempt at Disney bounding.
3142000	3149000	So I have a Captain Marvel like skater dress and all I need is a brown hoodie or sweater.
3149000	3155000	And then I'm going to get like flight pin to pin to the the jacket, you know, kind of like her end of the movie outfit.
3155000	3156000	Yeah.
3156000	3158000	Well, I didn't see the movie, but I know the outfit.
3158000	3163000	But, you know, I was just thinking I haven't Disney bounded before I have got the dress.
3163000	3165000	You know, why not just go have fun?
3165000	3167000	So some folks in chat full support of what you're doing.
3167000	3170000	Why are not that you need anybody's permission.
3170000	3174000	But why are says going to an amusement park by yourself equals you get to do whatever the heck you want.
3174000	3177000	And Bobby Blackwell says best part of Disney by yourself is being a single rider.
3177000	3179000	Jump all the lines.
3179000	3182000	Well, on top of that, anyway, I always wait for the front of the lines like for.
3182000	3189000	Well, now it would be in credit coaster, which I haven't been on, but it's the same roller coaster.
3189000	3194000	But, you know, I I usually wait for four fronts of the lines anyway.
3194000	3196000	So I have no problem with that.
3196000	3201000	Will you FaceTime me when you go on a credit coaster just so you can stick your phone out so I can ride the ride with you?
3201000	3205000	I actually drop the ride or drop it. Bad idea.
3205000	3211000	Well, I mean, I would hold it, but usually because of my vertigo problem, I'm actually really holding tight.
3211000	3213000	I also have to hold my glasses on sometimes.
3213000	3215000	She just needs to strap a GoPro to her head.
3215000	3220000	All right. All right. FaceTime me on Haunted Mansion, then someone give me a GoPro.
3220000	3224000	Give me a GoPro and I will record all of my.
3224000	3231000	But the problem being number one, Loco Poco, I hate mint juleps. Hate them.
3231000	3236000	She's responding to a chat comment about Loco Poco says lobster roll gumbo and mint juleps.
3236000	3240000	I'm not going to Blue Bayou because it'll be me.
3240000	3245000	And since my gastric bypass, I can't eat enough food to make it worthwhile.
3245000	3251000	So I'm actually going to be bringing a messenger bag with me into the park for my stuff.
3251000	3259000	And I'm probably going to have little containers of leftovers with me because I will probably get like one like maybe a Monte Cristo.
3259000	3265000	And that will be three meals for me. I'm not joking. That will be three meals.
3265000	3270000	Although Blue Bayou is one of my favorite places to eat. My other favorite place is gone.
3270000	3276000	I do have a bucket. Oh, the bucket of meat. And I like car.
3276000	3279000	OK, I ate their one wrap up a little bit. Sorry.
3279000	3285000	Getting a little deep on Disney and it is a gaming podcast, but I do let us know like what types of like games you see there.
3285000	3290000	You know, maybe I just got excited. I just got excited. You should. Well, you know, they had Kingdom Hearts pins.
3290000	3296000	Yeah. They have King Mickey in the hood. We want the update on all the loot because there's a third game out there now to support.
3296000	3300000	So, you know, the third game actually came with its own pin.
3300000	3308000	Yeah. Anyway, also so. So Dark Soccer is going to be there. So again, this is this is about there being no show next Sunday.
3308000	3315000	I'm going to be in Chicago, which is fun because I have a lot of good friends there that I visit once a year or try to.
3315000	3323000	But the whole way this started before it turned into this whole now Alan's coming and we're just going to hang out with friends and everything is that I'm going to an Ingress anomaly.
3323000	3329000	It's like a live event for Ingress. So that's going to be a lot of fun. So that is that is actually on Saturday.
3329000	3333000	But I'm not going to be back in time. So they do unknowns for that as well.
3333000	3338000	No, because because it's not the same like Pokemon and Ingress don't overlap. They understand that.
3338000	3345000	But, you know, they're not they're already there. No, in fact, what actually actually it's kind of the reverse of that.
3345000	3352000	Niantic did some shitty planning because that Lapras, that shiny Lapras like the it's a three hour event, if I remember right.
3352000	3356000	And the first or the last hour of the event is the first hour of the anomaly.
3356000	3360000	So they they overlapped it. So so we can't do both.
3360000	3365000	And it's actually really annoying because there's a lot of people that are like, but I want to catch Lapras.
3365000	3368000	I was like, no, we need you. You know, you need to be firing bursters.
3368000	3376000	So they overlap.
3376000	3380000	No, by the way, I got my shiny Torchic today.
3380000	3385000	Oh, yes, I did play Pokemon Go and I got I played via Bluetooth and I caught one Torchic.
3385000	3390000	So I'm I'm happy enough with that. I want a second window of all that.
3390000	3394000	I evolved it all the way and got that whatever you're supposed to get the skin or whatever.
3394000	3399000	Yeah, the special powered one. And I did get one shiny, but it's no shit stats.
3399000	3403000	So, I don't know. All right.
3403000	3406000	So anyway, yeah, so that's why we won't be here next Sunday.
3406000	3409000	But, you know, we'll miss you and we'll be back in two weeks.
3409000	3412000	And E3 is going to be here before we know it.
3412000	3415000	I may stream something because Bobby said that he would just kick it over to me.
3415000	3418000	So we'll see. Because you're still not a affiliate, right?
3418000	3422000	No, I'm not. It's a really good way to get your average numbers up.
3422000	3425000	So I'd really consider it. Yeah, I probably will.
3425000	3428000	All right. Do some DDR or something. Play something fun. We'll see.
3428000	3432000	All right. And also, I should just note, you know, episode seven, seven, seven.
3432000	3436000	Although, I don't know, we kind of stopped celebrating landmark numbers a long time ago.
3436000	3445000	This one has some particular significance to it because 7-7-7 is a song that was originally in Guitar Freaks, right?
3445000	3449000	And then was in Poppin' Music and then was in DDR. So it's in like all the big Bawani franchises.
3449000	3451000	So 7-7-7 is actually the name of the song.
3451000	3456000	So I remember back in the day when we were focused on music games and I think we were doing episodes.
3456000	3460000	I want to say it was during episode 77. Somebody probably cracked the joke.
3460000	3463000	Like, oh, we're so close. We probably played 7-7-7 on a break or something.
3463000	3465000	We probably cracked the joke.
3465000	3469000	Did we play 7-7-7 or did we play the seven jump? Because we probably played the seven jump.
3469000	3472000	We probably played both. We played a lot of music back in those days. We probably played both.
3472000	3478000	But I imagine we cracked the joke about, oh, 7-7-7 will be here, but we won't.
3478000	3485000	You know, it's everything like, or we said, gosh, if the show stays on pace, will it be on episode 7-7-7 by like 2018, 2019?
3485000	3489000	Or whatever we predicted at the time because you never know, like weeks off, holidays, things like that.
3489000	3493000	We might've thought it was going to be earlier and here we are. We're still here, believe it or not.
3493000	3498000	So in some ways it's kind of, kind of funny because I know we made the joke at some point that, well,
3498000	3502000	we're not going to be there when episode 7-7-7 hits and yet we are.
3502000	3505000	So thank you all for being here and making it worth it.
3505000	3506000	Because the show what we knew.
3506000	3507000	Yeah, right.
3507000	3511000	Whatevs. Don't listen to us anymore. We don't know what we're talking about.
3511000	3514000	All right. Anyway, let's get into some news.
3514000	3517000	So Loki, start us off with some headlines, some news this week.
3517000	3524000	So as I mentioned, I did purchase Shakedown, or Shakedown Hawaii, I want to say Shakedown Miami.
3524000	3531000	No, on the Epic Games Store during their Epic Games Store sale, their mega sale.
3531000	3537000	Now this sale is a little different than most sales that you would see like on the Steam store.
3537000	3544000	Because this one, the developers behind the games, they have no real say in this at all.
3544000	3553000	Epic is just giving you $10 per game that's over $15 or $15 and more towards your purchase.
3553000	3558000	So like for example, this game was $19.99. I paid $9.99. Sounds good to me.
3558000	3565000	However, not a lot of people or developers around here are kind of happy with this.
3565000	3568000	Because one, it's devaluing their game.
3568000	3574000	So on other platforms, they may also have an agreement where they have to keep price parity.
3574000	3580000	And since they didn't have a say over the fact that whether they participated in the discounts or not,
3580000	3585000	it's just kind of happening with Epic doing it, that they're a little unhappy with that.
3585000	3587000	And I can actually put them in some trouble.
3587000	3593000	In fact, there's even been some publishers dropping out of this as well.
3593000	3602000	So for example, one of the publishers during the Mega Sale that's behind Vampire the Masquerade Bloodlines 2,
3602000	3609000	they had taken their game off of the storefront for a while because of this reason as well.
3609000	3612000	They said, and of course Epic came out and commented,
3612000	3617000	if a developer or publisher chooses not to participate in our sales, we will honor that decision.
3617000	3620000	Paradox Interactive has chosen not to participate in the Epic Mega Sale.
3620000	3623000	And the game has been temporarily removed from sale.
3623000	3628000	If you purchase Vampire the Masquerade Bloodlines 2 during the period when the discount did not apply at the time of checkout,
3628000	3630000	Epic will honor that price.
3630000	3638000	So I get it. So Epic was putting these games on sale and publishers kind of just got told they were participating.
3638000	3641000	Or it almost sounds like, do it now, ask for forgiveness later.
3641000	3646000	Which when it comes to money, it seems like a really amateurish mistake by Epic.
3646000	3657000	Whoa, it gets better. So not only are their publishers, not only are the developers not necessarily behind on having their games on here.
3657000	3660000	So on top of that, there's some games that are being pre-ordered right now.
3660000	3661000	And this actually applies to pre-orders.
3661000	3665000	Funny enough, Borderlands 3 is not able to be pre-ordered right now.
3665000	3670000	So I can't put $10 towards that because that would be something I'd want to put $10 towards.
3670000	3672000	But they know that game's going to sell whatever.
3672000	3673000	It's also a little too easy.
3673000	3675000	Yeah, it's a little too easy, but whatever.
3675000	3680000	So they have, you know, that it's devaluing their game and that may cause people to wait on that.
3680000	3687000	But the people that did actually take part in this as well, if you had made five purchases in a row, guess what?
3687000	3694000	Because they don't have a cart that you can build, you know, that you can buy multiple games at a time, you have to do a piecemeal one at a time.
3694000	3701000	You do it five times, the system flags you as the transactions that, I don't know the exact term,
3701000	3708000	but it's basically phishing and you lock your account because that you're purchasing all these games.
3708000	3714000	So, I mean, I think this is, you know, it's finally the Epic Store kind of showing maybe where their weakness is.
3714000	3718000	And that is experience because I think there's been a lot of people that have been saying,
3718000	3724000	oh, well Steam, you know, they suck because, you know, their store is full of garbage and, you know,
3724000	3726000	the Epic Store gives more money to the publishers.
3726000	3733000	And we even saw when the Epic Store, when they came out and they said, well, we'll stop grabbing all these exclusive borderlands and stuff
3733000	3736000	when Steam starts giving more share to the publishers and so forth.
3736000	3743000	So, they say that and then they do this on one hand, which in some ways is almost a little bit anti-publisher
3743000	3748000	to not ask for permission first before putting all these games on sale.
3748000	3751000	That's a really, I mean, I don't know a better word than it's a dumb move.
3751000	3753000	It's a dumb move what they did.
3753000	3758000	I mean, sure, the consumers, the gamers are sitting here going, great, deals, sales, great.
3758000	3763000	Sure, but I mean, don't you guys see how stupid that is that Epic on one hand is saying,
3763000	3767000	well, Steam, if you'd only do this, and then they go and do something bonehead like this?
3767000	3769000	Like, it just shows a very big lack of experience.
3769000	3771000	And how long are they going to be able to just throw money at the problem?
3771000	3778000	You know, it's not that, you know, people don't necessarily want to jump into the Epic Store because it's the Epic Store.
3778000	3783000	They don't want to jump in because the Epic Store doesn't have most of the features that Steam has right now.
3783000	3787000	It's very bare bones and there's not a lot of games on there.
3787000	3794000	And yeah, the sale is a neat idea, but, you know, and it's good that you're paying that portion to it,
3794000	3802000	but how long are you going to be able to throw money at the store to get people to come in before people just realize that, you know, whatever.
3802000	3807000	I'm, like, personally, I bought this game on the Epic Store because it's exclusive there right now.
3807000	3811000	I wanted to play it. I could have bought it on console, but I'm never going to get the TV back, so it's fine.
3811000	3815000	I'm just going to play it on my PC, and I'm happy they did it.
3815000	3818000	Doesn't mean I'm going to buy all my games on the Epic Store.
3818000	3820000	So, you know, I don't know.
3820000	3825000	YYR, with his perspective in our chat at Twitch TV slash VOG Network, saying,
3825000	3827000	FYI, all Steam sales are opt-in.
3827000	3834000	If I don't log into the Steamworks portal, accept the terms, and set a discount rate, my games don't get discounts during big Steam sales.
3834000	3838000	And Metal Mayhem says, yeah, they made an epic goof.
3838000	3842000	I'm going to fucking quit this show, I swear to God.
3842000	3845000	No, just sad trombone it in your head and move on.
3845000	3848000	Alright. Anything else to say about this sale?
3848000	3849000	So you did take advantage of it.
3849000	3855000	I did take advantage of it, and I was going to purchase another game, but, like, I didn't really want any of the quadratic dream games.
3855000	3859000	I was like, eh. I would have picked up Borderlands. I would have pre-ordered that.
3859000	3861000	I said pre-order.
3861000	3869000	I know, but then that totally, like, considering how much games rely on that release week sales, like, to devalue that release week, that would have been horrible.
3869000	3873000	So I understand why Borderlands 3 is not participating in that. I totally understand that.
3873000	3874000	Very convenient.
3874000	3878000	Alright, SGA100Matt saying, don't quit. How about this? How about this? We'll make an agreement.
3878000	3882000	I'm going to quit for one week. I quit for one week.
3882000	3884000	I'm not coming back next week.
3884000	3885000	I'm not coming back next week.
3885000	3886000	But the week after.
3886000	3887000	The week after, I'll be here.
3887000	3889000	Alright.
3889000	3893000	Moving on. Something that maybe I would quit OLR to go play.
3893000	3897000	No, just kidding. I wouldn't because I don't know how I feel about this.
3897000	3901000	I'm very much of two schools of thought about this, but it is the World of Warcraft classic.
3901000	3904000	So I was playing World of Warcraft in the vanilla day.
3904000	3908000	I didn't play long. I played much more in the Burning Crusade days.
3908000	3912000	I even was raiding in those days with some local friends and all that stuff.
3912000	3914000	But in the vanilla wow, I played, like, a little bit of it.
3914000	3920000	And then, of course, I played most of the expansions until I kind of left for Final Fantasy XIV.
3920000	3922000	And then I check in on wow once in a while.
3922000	3925000	Wow is the one I like to visit once in a while.
3925000	3927000	Have a fling with here and there.
3927000	3934000	But World of Warcraft classic will be there for you to experience the World of Warcraft in the vanilla mode, or the 1.0 mode.
3934000	3939000	Or actually, specifically, I think it's 1.2.2 mode, I think.
3939000	3941000	Sorry, I may have the version number wrong.
3941000	3946000	But it's one of the later patches in vanilla that I think incorporates on Karaj and things like that.
3946000	3950000	But anyway, the release date came out this week. It will be out on August 26th.
3950000	3952000	That's the big day.
3952000	3956000	The UK is also that's the day, and that's the day in the Americas.
3956000	3961000	Some of the other regions, just the way the time zones work, it'll actually be August 27th.
3961000	3966000	If you subscribe to World of Warcraft, you are also automatically subscribed to this, basically.
3966000	3967000	There's no extra cost.
3967000	3969000	So this is included with a wow subscription.
3969000	3974000	So if you want to pay your subscription to play Classic WoW, if you're one of those people that's like,
3974000	3976000	I hate that newfangled wow.
3976000	3978000	I liked leveling all my weapons and my fists.
3978000	3982000	Back in my day, you had to level to 40 to get a mount. We liked it.
3982000	3985000	Or really, my only thing, I miss Baron's Chat.
3985000	3989000	So, well, just think, Baron's Chat will be back with this.
3989000	3991000	That's still not enough to make me play old WoW.
3991000	3993000	Not enough to make me play old WoW.
3993000	3995000	Baron's Chat is also not a good thing. I'm sorry.
3995000	3997000	No, it was kind of accessible.
3997000	3999000	You're going to log into that chat.
3999000	4000000	That's Baron's Chat.
4000000	4001000	Okay.
4001000	4002000	Oh, it's so cute.
4002000	4003000	You're going to really play it.
4003000	4004000	Oh, you're so adorable.
4004000	4005000	Okay.
4005000	4006000	So, Baron's Chat.
4006000	4009000	The Baron's was this zone.
4009000	4010000	It was huge.
4010000	4011000	It was huge.
4011000	4016000	So because it was such a huge zone and there were so many different level characters that went through there,
4016000	4019000	the general chat was just like a chat room, basically.
4019000	4024000	And general chat is for you to like, hi, I'm looking for somebody to help me with this quest.
4024000	4025000	Or who wants it?
4025000	4028000	Because, again, in vanilla WoW, there was no dungeon finder.
4028000	4033000	So, looking for two more for Wailing Caverns, you know, things like that, right?
4033000	4036000	And it really was big. It was easily the size of three zones.
4036000	4037000	Right.
4037000	4040000	So, Baron's was such a huge zone that the chat room just turned into,
4040000	4044000	just imagine an unmoderated general topic IRC chat room.
4044000	4045000	Old AOL.
4045000	4049000	That's where your Chuck Norris jokes all came from, was Baron's Chat and all that.
4049000	4051000	So, that's...
4051000	4053000	But with Cataclysm, they broke it into two zones.
4053000	4054000	Yes.
4054000	4056000	And with different level areas for each part.
4056000	4059000	Yeah, so Cataclysm kind of broke Baron's Chat, in a way.
4059000	4062000	But now they all went to trade chat, because trade chat's across all zones.
4062000	4066000	But I don't know, I feel like the garbage chat isn't there like it used to be.
4066000	4070000	I think in the cities, the cities are all linked together with their chat,
4070000	4071000	and that's where you see it the most.
4071000	4072000	Like the local?
4072000	4077000	Yeah, people will get in there and argue politics in the general.
4077000	4079000	It's usually why I just stay in guild chat, whether or not anyone's talking.
4079000	4083000	That's also why the first thing I do in my World of Warcraft account starts up.
4083000	4085000	Congrats, you have a new character. You have spawned.
4085000	4087000	Slash leave general.
4087000	4091000	It's the first thing I do before I even press the key to move.
4091000	4095000	I'll keep it open for train wreck time, but other than that, yeah.
4095000	4097000	I just redo all my windows.
4097000	4098000	Yeah.
4098000	4102000	Vidpower573 in chat says, Baron's Chat had so many in-jokes.
4102000	4105000	Chuck Norris, Mankirk's wife, I'll remember that,
4105000	4110000	because plot twist, she's dead, and she's really hard to find.
4110000	4114000	So multiple times an hour, somebody's yelling out in chat,
4114000	4116000	where's Mankirk's wife?
4116000	4119000	She's dead.
4119000	4121000	This was even before we had Wowhead, right?
4121000	4122000	Oh, yeah.
4122000	4123000	Yeah, way before Wowhead.
4123000	4126000	Because I don't know if mods were in vanilla WoW.
4126000	4127000	I can't remember.
4127000	4130000	There wasn't as much strong of a mod community, so I don't know.
4130000	4135000	Anyway, the Drums of War update from August 2006,
4135000	4138000	that is the version that they're going to be using for this.
4138000	4143000	They're doing a whole WoW 15th birthday with some in-game events.
4143000	4148000	There's a $100 15th anniversary collector's edition of the game if you want.
4148000	4150000	So you want to spend $100 on WoW?
4150000	4151000	No.
4151000	4153000	You'll get a 10-inch Ragnaros statue for that.
4153000	4155000	A pen, a mousepad, and some art.
4155000	4156000	Yay art.
4156000	4157000	Whatever.
4157000	4159000	Also of note, and this is cracking me up,
4159000	4164000	because there is a beta going on, you have people filing bug reports.
4164000	4171000	Unfortunately, not everybody's memory is really working the same way,
4171000	4177000	because people are filing bug reports for things that were actually features in WoW 1.0.
4177000	4178000	Like what?
4178000	4180000	For example, actually I'm glad you asked,
4180000	4183000	because Blizzard made what's called a blue post.
4183000	4186000	That means an official Blizzard team member went on the forums and made a post saying,
4186000	4189000	That means an official Blizzard team member went on the forums and made a post saying,
4189000	4196000	As we've discussed before, the nature of WoW Classic sometimes invokes different memories for different players.
4196000	4203000	And this leads to certain misconceptions for some about what is or isn't working as intended.
4203000	4209000	The following is a list of commonly reported gameplay in WoW Classic that is not actually a bug
4209000	4211000	and working as we expect it to.
4212000	4216000	Tauren's hitboxes and their melee reach is larger than other races.
4216000	4221000	Tauren are the big cow people, so obviously they're bigger.
4221000	4230000	Being critically struck while using slash sit to sit does not cause abilities like enrage, blood craze, and reckoning to activate.
4230000	4236000	Warrior health regeneration is working at the expected rate.
4237000	4241000	Feared players and NPCs run fast.
4245000	4251000	Standing on top of other players while facing away allows spells and attacks to be used.
4251000	4253000	I'm trying to find other ones that are...
4253000	4258000	Quests that are too low level do not show up as an exclamation point in the game world.
4258000	4260000	They just didn't...
4260000	4263000	Available quests do not display an exclamation on the mini map.
4263000	4265000	That was a thing they added way later in the game.
4265000	4269000	Either they never played vanilla or they just don't remember.
4269000	4278000	On level up, the message, your skill in protection increased to 15 was added in 1.12.1 and we're intending to keep that.
4278000	4281000	We appreciate all of your feedback.
4281000	4283000	I'm sorry, this is really funny.
4283000	4287000	Because it just also goes on to show how many people were like,
4287000	4290000	Fuck yeah, WoW Classic, yeah, WoW Classic, I want to play WoW Classic.
4291000	4296000	And then they forget, WoW Classic had no quality of life improvements, none, zero.
4296000	4298000	You know me here, you don't know shit.
4301000	4302000	Have fun with that.
4302000	4306000	I don't know, there's a part of me that like, it'll be fun for a minute.
4306000	4308000	And then there's another part of me that's like,
4308000	4314000	But why did they spend all this time perfecting this?
4314000	4319000	They went back and made this compatible with the 16x9 resolutions and all that stuff.
4319000	4322000	And went back to make sure it works on the modern PCs and all that.
4322000	4327000	It's kind of like, why did they spend the time doing that when they could have like, I don't know, made the current WoW better?
4327000	4331000	It's just, I don't know, whatever.
4331000	4333000	I wish them luck.
4333000	4335000	I'll be curious to see how many people are playing.
4335000	4337000	Because you're going to have to pay to play it.
4337000	4339000	So I'll be curious how many people do that.
4339000	4342000	I'll be very, very curious how many people are on those servers.
4342000	4346000	In the meantime, DarkSakura, you have some relatively big news for us this week.
4346000	4351000	Yep. Basically, dogs and cats living together.
4351000	4354000	Mass hysteria. No, I'm kidding.
4354000	4359000	Microsoft and Sony are going to team up and have an AI cloud baby.
4359000	4362000	It might be monstrous, we don't know.
4362000	4367000	Anyway, so they are actually going to be working together.
4367000	4370000	And yes, both sides have admitted that they've worked together in the past.
4370000	4373000	But are also still rivals in some areas.
4373000	4374000	That's just the way they are.
4374000	4378000	Oh my God, is Microsoft putting Halo on the PlayStation 5?
4378000	4381000	Because that's what I heard on Twitter when somebody put this story.
4381000	4385000	Microsoft and Sony are working together. Oh my God.
4385000	4388000	Way to assume. You know what happens when you assume?
4388000	4391000	You become an asshole. I'm sorry.
4391000	4394000	That's how I'm going to say it from now on, you become an asshole.
4394000	4399000	Anyway, Microsoft has their Azure cloud service.
4399000	4401000	It's a computing platform.
4401000	4404000	And so Microsoft and Sony are going to both be using it.
4404000	4409000	It's to support game content, digital content, streaming services.
4409000	4421000	And the kind of speculation about this is that Sony is going to be using this for development of AI.
4422000	4429000	And using their sensors and chips in the Microsoft cloud systems.
4429000	4432000	As in their local servers and computers that run it.
4432000	4438000	To better make cloud work. Rain things better. Or more betterer.
4438000	4442000	Anyway, it's going to cloud stuff better. Yeah, there we go.
4442000	4443000	And then he'll have better hair.
4443000	4450000	So at any rate, the quote from Yoshida Kenichiro, who is Sony's CEO, says, quote,
4450000	4453000	for many years Microsoft has been a key business partner for us.
4453000	4457000	Though, of course, the two companies have also been competing in some areas.
4457000	4464000	I believe that our joint development of future cloud solutions will contribute greatly to the advancement of interactive content, end quote.
4464000	4472000	And basically their goal for Sony is to evolve the platform of the PlayStation into one that uses internet cloud solutions.
4472000	4477000	That uses internet cloud services for better entertainment at any time, any place.
4477000	4483000	So they're looking to make it. I don't know if that might be a hint at another handheld.
4483000	4486000	Or, I mean, I don't think so.
4486000	4487000	I don't think so either.
4487000	4493000	But it could also be that maybe Nintendo has set the bar with what they did with the Switch.
4493000	4496000	That maybe Sony might take.
4496000	4499000	Sorry, maybe I shouldn't be so quick to dismiss handhelds.
4499000	4502000	Because, I mean, after all, a lot of cloud gaming is including handhelds.
4502000	4504000	So maybe I shouldn't be so quick to dismiss that.
4504000	4507000	But I don't think that's the ultimate focus or ultimate goal.
4507000	4510000	That will be more a side effect, if I may.
4510000	4517000	Well, and of course, part of me also wonders if maybe this venture might be something to counteract Stadia.
4517000	4521000	Well, you know, it's funny because Nifty 805 in our chat brings up the same question there.
4521000	4524000	I wonder if it's a response to Google's upcoming cloud service.
4524000	4531000	I don't think it's a response so much as it is the entire industry trying to read the tea leaves on where is this industry going.
4531000	4534000	And I think Google has kind of shown their hand first.
4534000	4540000	And now we're getting a little insight, we're getting a little peek as to what cards Microsoft and Sony are holding.
4540000	4545000	And the joke is they're actually working together in some regards.
4545000	4548000	This doesn't mean Halo is going to be on the next PlayStation.
4548000	4549000	It's not like where this is going.
4550000	4553000	This isn't even about the PlayStation 5.
4553000	4561000	I think one way I kind of put this on Twitter is that it isn't about the PlayStation 5 so much as it is where is gaming going to be in 2025.
4561000	4567000	And on top of this too, they haven't said anything about rivaling what Stadia is going to offer.
4567000	4571000	Too soon. We don't really know what Stadia is offering, to be fair.
4571000	4578000	And honestly, I think that it's wise to come out with what they have because it seems very non-reactionary.
4578000	4583000	You know, there's some places who are like, oh, I'm losing my shit. Here's big knee-jerk reaction.
4583000	4586000	We have to combat this now without looking long-term.
4586000	4596000	And I think in this case, sometimes rivals can come together for mutual self-preservation.
4596000	4597000	That make sense?
4597000	4607000	You know, something that even though they are in competition in some fields, overall it will benefit the both of them better if only humans could do that.
4607000	4610000	Politics. But still.
4610000	4616000	Going to chat for some other comments because Kaijuto in chat says, if games go streaming only, I'm out.
4616000	4622000	You know, I don't want to say, you know, pack your bags, but I think you have many years.
4622000	4627000	I think, again, this is a lot of tea leaf reading for many years down the line.
4627000	4631000	This is not something I think that's going to affect right away anyway the next generation of games.
4632000	4639000	The fact maybe that Sony is looking to partner with Microsoft's cloud services as opposed to, say, Amazon's or another, you know, building their own.
4639000	4644000	I suppose that is an interesting feature that could have some type of effect on PlayStation 5.
4644000	4648000	But as far as like gaming going completely into the cloud, I don't think we're there yet.
4648000	4655000	But as we talked about, you know, a lot of parallels to when we had this show right after Google made their announcement about Stadia.
4655000	4658000	You know, I think in many ways, I don't want to retread that ground too much.
4658000	4668000	But I think in many ways, just like the movie industry has very much gone to this Netflix, Disney, Hulu, CBS, NBC.
4668000	4670000	Disney took over Hulu now, didn't they?
4670000	4673000	I know, right, but yet they're keeping it separate services. What?
4673000	4675000	You know, I wonder how long that's going to last.
4675000	4677000	But anyway, I want to get into movie talk.
4677000	4686000	But you can kind of see that when the industries kind of go in there for that direction, that gaming could be looking at a similar future.
4686000	4690000	Now, I mean, does that mean that the need for physical media is going to be gone forever?
4690000	4694000	Not necessarily. I mean, Blu-rays are still a thing for collectibles.
4694000	4697000	Going to see a movie at a theater is still a thing.
4697000	4702000	But even in the theater, do you know how much of that is kind of cloud-based theater?
4702000	4704000	I know that sounds really weird.
4704000	4708000	But do you know how like movies are kind of like downloaded basically to projectors?
4708000	4713000	That's kind of how things work now to avoid getting leaked early.
4713000	4719000	And also, I mean, the whole, you guys know like the Fathom Events thing. What the hell do you think that is?
4719000	4722000	It's witchcraft is what it is.
4722000	4731000	It's movie theaters in the cloud, right? The cloud is, all it is, is just like, it's the internet, right?
4731000	4738000	Yeah, pretty much. I mean, so with the Fathom Events, let's say they're doing a night at the, or what do they do?
4738000	4741000	They do the classic, yeah, the opera stuff.
4741000	4746000	Yeah, and I went and saw Karate Kid a few weeks ago, and we saw Ghostbusters last year.
4746000	4749000	So they show like an interview with the celebrities before him, right?
4749000	4754000	So that's beaming out of some theater in Los Angeles, and it's beaming into all these movie theaters.
4754000	4758000	It's like, I flat out asked him, he's like, I don't trust the cloud thing. What about the internet? Do you trust that?
4758000	4761000	Yeah, same thing. Really the same thing.
4761000	4764000	And Kajuda says, stream it as an alternative is fine. Do what you want.
4764000	4768000	But once I can't buy a game CD or buy a game digitally, I'm out.
4768000	4771000	And I, you know, I think it's too early to say, you know, we'll-
4771000	4774000	You're never not going to be able to buy a game. It's just, it's going to be-
4774000	4777000	In these, I think we'll always kind of still have that market too.
4777000	4782000	Because if it's not working, if not, everyone's going to do it. Now everyone's going to, there's not going to be all of a sudden the law says,
4782000	4787000	sorry, this is the only way you can release games now. You can't do it any other way.
4787000	4792000	So I think as far as Kajuda, as far as your statement goes, which I'm sure you're not alone in what you're thinking there,
4792000	4797000	is that it is nice to, when you pay $60 for something, have something physical in your hand that you can touch.
4797000	4802000	Like that, I get that. That is nice to have, right? Because in this day and age, we've heard too much of,
4802000	4806000	you bought something digitally and then poof, the game went away, as did your money, poof, it's gone.
4806000	4811000	It evaporated into the cloud. Bye-bye. Yes, I get it. I mean, I get it.
4811000	4816000	But it's just going to be interesting to see kind of like where the industry sort of goes with that.
4816000	4822000	But I think it'll be more like, you know, the AAA games. Or maybe using the cloud as a support.
4822000	4830000	You know, maybe you still will have a physical disk, but the actual PlayStation 6, again, I'm totally like theorizing here,
4830000	4836000	maybe uses the cloud to do some of the difficult computations. Who knows?
4836000	4841000	Yes, such difficult computations like Crackdown 3's multiplayer, which no one plays anymore.
4841000	4848000	Exactly. Let's see, YYR in chat says the cloud just means someone else's computer.
4848000	4854000	Essentially, essentially. Or maybe like a bunch of supercomputers all tied together. But anyway.
4854000	4860000	And the other good news is, Kaijuto, is that if you're a Nintendo fan, I guarantee you,
4860000	4865000	Nintendo will be last to the party on whatever this is. So, if you're a Nintendo fan,
4865000	4871000	you're going to have like just a built-in five more years before they go to it, just by default.
4871000	4877000	So, you do have that. I guess so. Enjoy it. Anyway, let's move on. Loki, what do you have for our next story?
4877000	4880000	I'm sorry, we did get everything out that we wanted to say about that. Okay, just making sure.
4880000	4884000	I want to make sure we didn't tangent in the middle of the story. Loki, what do we have next?
4884000	4886000	So, this is something that looks pretty awesome that I need to try.
4886000	4891000	So, you know how they have all these wonderful Twitch streams that do different things with games,
4891000	4897000	usually with some more viewer interactivity. So, they have a new extension now called Crowd Control,
4897000	4903000	which allows players to be able to interact with the streamer's games in different ways.
4903000	4913000	So, for example, in Super Mario Bros. 3, you can spend a small number of bits to spawn items or enemies in the game.
4913000	4922000	Or they may have it where you can do something with a randomizer or something to that effect.
4922000	4927000	So, right now they have the software controls several different games.
4927000	4932000	So, they have 12 games supported. Dark Souls, Mega Man 2, Mega Man 3, Mega Man 4, Mega Man 8,
4932000	4941000	Mega Man X, Pokemon Red and Blue, Super Mario Bros. 3, Super Mario Bros. 64, Super Mario World, Super Metroid,
4941000	4945000	Legend of Zelda, Link of the Past, Randomizer are all supported.
4945000	4947000	I kind of want to get in on this. This sounds really fun.
4947000	4948000	It does sound like fun.
4948000	4952000	Yeah, I love the interactive stuff on Twitch. That's what makes Twitch so much more exciting,
4952000	4955000	which is why we invite you to participate with our show on Sunday nights.
4955000	4959000	Which, by the way, I hate to tangent, but I have to say, I'm going to say it once,
4960000	4966000	but apparently that show that we've been up against pretty regularly on Sunday nights just finished.
4966000	4971000	I'm not going to spoil, but apparently it's all over social media at this point.
4971000	4974000	What's going on? Because all I asked, because I don't watch the show,
4974000	4977000	I put, are people pissed at it like the last two episodes?
4977000	4979000	Because the last two episodes weren't very well received.
4979000	4981000	Are people pissed at it like the last two episodes?
4981000	4982000	That's all I want to know.
4982000	4984000	And Bobby says yes.
4984000	4985000	Quest Buster says yes.
4985000	4986000	Don't say anything.
4986000	4987000	I know, don't say anything.
4988000	4989000	He's waiting for the butt.
4989000	4990000	I need to go see it at home.
4990000	4993000	That's all I wanted to know. Are people pissed off?
4993000	4997000	Are we going to have days and days? Did Silky win Drag Race?
4997000	4999000	Are we going to have that kind of meltdown going on?
4999000	5000000	I know the answer.
5000000	5003000	I know, I know. I know those spoilers are out there too.
5003000	5006000	I can't wait because I know my expectations are so low,
5007000	5011000	and I'm waiting to be disappointed, but I need to do that at my own time.
5011000	5015000	I don't want to be spoiled because I want to be like, really? Is that what they did?
5015000	5017000	That's all I'm going to say. That's all I'm going to say about that.
5017000	5021000	I never derail for that, but I have to admit, coming into tonight's show,
5021000	5023000	I knew we were up against that goddamn finale,
5023000	5026000	and all I want to know is, are people going to be pissed at it?
5026000	5029000	Is it going to be like a Sopranos kind of ending where people are fucking pissed at it?
5029000	5031000	Oh, they're already mad after the last episode.
5031000	5032000	I know.
5032000	5037000	But you know, my thought was maybe it was kind of like a couple subpar episodes
5037000	5040000	because the finale is like, oh shit.
5040000	5042000	It was all set up for a finale.
5042000	5045000	It's more like, oh, X-Men Origins Wolverine.
5045000	5049000	Yeah, now it sounds like, oh, they took a shit. That's too bad.
5049000	5051000	They're like, oh, we want to work on something else.
5051000	5054000	Maybe they should have waited for him to finish the book. That's too bad.
5054000	5057000	All right, anyway, new topic. Back to games. Sorry, back to Twitch.
5057000	5059000	Anyways, so yeah, that sounds really awesome.
5059000	5061000	I've seen other things that people have done.
5061000	5064000	I don't know if it's other extensions that they build,
5064000	5068000	but I've seen one, there's a guy that does speed runs
5068000	5072000	of Grand Theft Auto San Andreas this way
5072000	5075000	where people are spawning and crap all over.
5075000	5079000	It's all sorts of crazy, but he'll play that for like eight hours
5079000	5083000	or several hours at a time with all this crazy shit going on at the same time
5083000	5086000	trying to play through the game with cars exploding and stuff.
5086000	5091000	So yes, I want to watch this, and I want to do this.
5091000	5094000	Yeah, I'm going to look into this when I get back from my trip
5094000	5096000	because I think this would be a really good incentive
5096000	5098000	for me to do more streaming on my personal channel too,
5098000	5100000	which I admittedly have been slipping on a little bit.
5100000	5103000	But I know we wanted to do some more stuff on our VoG channel too
5103000	5105000	just so we have more stuff outside of just Sundays
5105000	5108000	and the hosting of Anime Jam Session on Tuesdays.
5108000	5110000	We want to do some more content, so this might be fun.
5110000	5111000	Yeah.
5111000	5113000	All right, cool. All right.
5113000	5117000	Well, moving on to a follow-up from, I think it was last week's show
5117000	5120000	when we talked about the big walkout that happened at Riot Games
5120000	5123000	where I think it was about 150 employees kind of walked out,
5123000	5125000	and Riot Games kind of had to play it off
5125000	5127000	because they know the whole world's watching us all.
5127000	5130000	It's cool. They can do the thing. They have to riot.
5130000	5133000	We support your decision to protest.
5133000	5135000	Well, an interesting kind of follow-up came up here
5135000	5140000	is that Riot Games apparently, because I guess originally they said
5140000	5143000	that as soon as current litigation was over,
5143000	5147000	it would give new rioters the choice to opt out of mandatory arbitration
5147000	5150000	for individual sexual harassment and sexual assault claims,
5150000	5153000	and then they would determine from there whether that opt-out
5153000	5155000	would apply to everyone and so forth.
5155000	5157000	So here's what they've come out and said.
5157000	5160000	So Riot put out a statement this week that said,
5160000	5163000	ultimately, given the complexities of ongoing litigation,
5163000	5168000	we will not change our employee agreements while in active litigation.
5168000	5170000	We know not everyone agrees with this decision,
5170000	5174000	but we also know everyone does want Riot to continue to improve.
5174000	5177000	We remain committed to having a firm answer around extending an opt-out
5177000	5180000	to all rioters when active litigation concludes.
5180000	5182000	Everything we've heard will impact our discussions
5182000	5185000	when we revisit arbitration, and we hope to have an answer
5185000	5187000	that will be satisfying to everyone.
5187000	5191000	At a minimum, we will give new rioters the option to opt out of arbitration
5191000	5194000	on individual sexual harassment claims.
5194000	5198000	So it sounds like some of those people protesting
5198000	5201000	are not going to get one of the things that they were asking for there.
5201000	5205000	So this might be the start of something,
5205000	5209000	because it was kind of mentioned in that walkout
5209000	5213000	that if they don't kind of relent to some of the demands,
5213000	5215000	this is going to escalate.
5215000	5217000	They won't talk about what that escalation is,
5217000	5220000	but I can certainly fantasize what some of that could be.
5220000	5223000	I mean, we could talk about employees quitting en masse,
5223000	5225000	starting a new company.
5225000	5230000	I have a feeling, and this would be a tricky thing,
5230000	5233000	but I think one of, especially in the video game industry,
5233000	5238000	I think one of a company's most valuable assets is its secrets.
5238000	5241000	And I think what you're going to see happen,
5241000	5245000	this is just a guess, but I think in the coming weeks,
5245000	5247000	if employees don't start getting what they want,
5247000	5249000	you're going to see some big expos.
5249000	5251000	It's going to have to all be anonymous and stuff,
5251000	5253000	but you're going to know about everything riot's doing,
5253000	5256000	because the employees are going to be demotivated
5256000	5258000	and not wanting to keep the secrets and stuff.
5258000	5259000	They're going to start blabbing.
5259000	5262000	And so we're going to start finding out what else has riot been working on,
5262000	5264000	what other heroes are under creation.
5264000	5265000	That's just a guess.
5265000	5267000	Again, I don't know anything.
5267000	5270000	I'm just thinking, what could escalation be?
5270000	5275000	And I think that is certainly one place where if you tick off enough people
5275000	5278000	that know your secrets and know what poker cards you're holding,
5278000	5279000	that could be a dangerous game.
5279000	5281000	The people are also the biggest asset.
5281000	5285000	There is no company without the people who work for it.
5285000	5288000	And a lot of companies have forgotten this.
5288000	5294000	If you invest in your employees and you make it a good place to work
5294000	5298000	and you keep them happy and you get a return on your investment,
5298000	5301000	you might put more in, but you get more back.
5301000	5304000	That's why I'm happy for where I work.
5304000	5307000	They put a lot into us and they pay us great and, well,
5307000	5309000	we're mostly pretty happy.
5309000	5312000	It's the same thing.
5312000	5315000	If you are treating your employees like garbage,
5315000	5317000	you're going to get garbage back.
5317000	5320000	I'm pretty lucky in the places where I've worked and in my current job.
5320000	5322000	I have a super understanding boss.
5322000	5325000	If I have to take care of personal things or what have you,
5325000	5330000	I'm able to have an extreme work-life balance in what I do.
5330000	5332000	Granted, I don't work in the gaming industry,
5332000	5334000	but I have an amazing work-life balance,
5334000	5337000	and I think that is one of the biggest keys to having happy employees, for sure.
5337000	5339000	I do want to read some comments in chat.
5339000	5341000	Bobby Blackwell says, regarding journalists,
5341000	5344000	apparently CD Projekt Red reached out to Kotaku
5344000	5348000	to get ahead of a crunch time story for Cyberpunk 2077,
5348000	5350000	Derek Freight of the Exposé.
5350000	5353000	I do remember seeing a story about how Cyberpunk and that development,
5353000	5356000	they put out a statement basically saying
5356000	5359000	that they are not going to be doing crunch time,
5359000	5363000	or that there will be crunch time, but it really will be voluntary,
5363000	5366000	and this is how they're going to make sure that people are not penalized
5366000	5369000	if they're not able to work it, or it's only during certain times.
5369000	5372000	They basically tried to put out a statement
5372000	5375000	on what they say crunch time is going to be
5375000	5379000	before there's an exposé about what it's been in the past sort of thing.
5379000	5382000	It's very interesting how this is affecting all these different gaming companies.
5382000	5383000	It's not just Riot.
5383000	5386000	If you feel guilty about the practice, maybe you shouldn't be doing it.
5386000	5387000	Yeah, yeah.
5389000	5392000	Anyway, I think it's going to be very interesting to see where this goes from here.
5392000	5397000	I mean, it's unfortunate that it's going to escalate from here.
5397000	5400000	I mean, don't get me, I'm not celebrating that,
5400000	5404000	but it's going to be interesting to see what consequences this has,
5404000	5407000	not just for Riot Games, but for the industry.
5407000	5409000	So, you know, we're all keeping our eyes on that.
5409000	5412000	So, that being said, let's move on to our next story, Dark Soccer.
5413000	5419000	Well, this, now, I'm going to specify this is information
5419000	5422000	coming from the World Health Organization, or WHO.
5423000	5429000	Anyway, video game addiction is possibly going to be recognized
5429000	5432000	as an official disease by the World Health Organization.
5433000	5437000	They're actually going to be voting on it this upcoming week,
5437000	5442000	and it comes from a body of evidence showing that young gamers face psychological distress
5442000	5448000	as a result of playing games and getting hooked on them or addicted behavior.
5448000	5452000	And I'll put it this way, it's the same as with any drug or any activity
5452000	5458000	that produces a chemical effect in the body, the same as with gambling.
5459000	5465000	You know, anything that does that nice little serotonin, dopamine release in the body
5465000	5470000	and makes you feel good about it, people can become addicted to that feeling
5470000	5474000	and keep doing the activities that generate that, right?
5474000	5478000	And so, when you are removing that from your life,
5478000	5483000	you are going through very real chemical withdrawal, end of story.
5483000	5487000	It's not all in your head, your body's chemicals are making this shit happen.
5487000	5490000	That's why some people are more prone to addiction than others.
5490000	5499000	But there's studies that show MRI scans that show a link between depression and video game addiction,
5499000	5504000	the same way that people react to drug abuse or alcoholism.
5508000	5515000	They were saying that WHO made a decision to put video gaming as a mental disorder
5515000	5519000	as part of their 11th revision of international classification diseases,
5519000	5523000	which I don't agree with, but they listed it as a disorder,
5523000	5528000	as a pattern of gaming behavior characterized by impaired control over gaming,
5528000	5533000	where basically they're putting their priority on gaming as opposed to other activities.
5533000	5536000	We've heard of the WoW Widows, right?
5536000	5540000	Oh, yeah. My pal Arya Snark says she was one.
5540000	5543000	She said, my boyfriend wouldn't go out with me
5543000	5546000	because he was, quote, storming the castle.
5546000	5555000	Well, at any rate, so there actually is, it's NHS National Health Service, UK,
5555000	5563000	actually has now, it's funding a game addiction center for children to seek treatment.
5563000	5571000	And there are people who will admit that, yeah, they were gaming addicts,
5571000	5575000	that their life fell apart and that they had to seek help.
5575000	5578000	But the same also goes, it's the same as gambling addiction.
5578000	5582000	It's the same as being addicted to a drug.
5582000	5590000	It's not in your head, like I said, it is a true disorder.
5590000	5598000	It is your body reacting in a chemical manner to either an activity or a substance that you are putting in it.
5598000	5600000	You become addicted to the feeling.
5600000	5606000	And in some cases, once you're used to having produced these level of chemicals in your body,
5606000	5611000	of course, you're going to need to continue the activity to continue producing these chemicals.
5611000	5617000	Also, love produces the same addictive quality.
5617000	5620000	And that's where the term seven-year itch comes from,
5620000	5625000	that on average for people find that those chemicals...
5625000	5627000	There's a lot of things you can get addicted to.
5627000	5628000	Sex is one of them.
5628000	5629000	No, not me.
5629000	5635000	I know, but there's like David Duchovny, I believe, was a famous actor that went to rehab for sex addiction.
5635000	5639000	Like it's a thing that can, you know, all these, you can get addicted to a lot of things.
5639000	5643000	Food, food's another good one because again, you're getting a hormonal release from it.
5643000	5651000	But at any rate, I mean, it's, I'm glad that they are doing this.
5651000	5652000	I really am.
5652000	5657000	Because that means that we'll have a hopefully better, you know,
5657000	5660000	implements out there to help people deal with these things.
5660000	5664000	I mean, like, I know Microsoft put out something that said they were trying to put more parental controls in.
5664000	5669000	One thing I was really happy about is there are like, for computers now,
5669000	5672000	more parental controls that also limit how much time.
5672000	5674000	It's like the screen time thing on the iPhone.
5674000	5678000	You know, you can limit how much time someone is using the device.
5679000	5685000	You know, for kids who are like, no, I want to play all the Fortnite ever, as an example.
5685000	5690000	But at the same time, it sets a control and gives time for a calm down.
5690000	5694000	And I really do think, it goes back to everything in moderation,
5694000	5697000	but there are some people who cannot self-moderate.
5697000	5701000	Yeah. No, and you know, as much as you might think I'm going to sit here and argue
5701000	5706000	because I'm a gaming enthusiast that, oh, this is just them trying to shame the industry and all this stuff.
5706000	5709000	No, I mean, video game addiction, that can be a real thing.
5709000	5711000	I mean, I think we recognize that.
5711000	5712000	It's activity addiction.
5712000	5714000	There's a lot of things that you can get addicted to in the world,
5714000	5716000	and video games can certainly be one of them.
5716000	5719000	I mean, there's been times in my life where I've even kind of looked and went,
5719000	5722000	whoa, whoa, guy, you need to pull it back on some of these games.
5722000	5724000	Like you're playing this game way too much.
5724000	5725000	Right.
5725000	5729000	You know, in some ways, like Pokemon Go and Ingress and those games, you know,
5729000	5732000	I used to play a lot of Ingress, but then I kind of recognized like,
5732000	5737000	I definitely had that what does it fucking matter moment, you know, and I scaled it way back.
5737000	5740000	Yeah, that's exactly it is that, you know,
5740000	5743000	it takes a turnaround in your own head to recognize that there's a problem.
5743000	5744000	Right.
5744000	5747000	And the moment that you do, the moment that you see it,
5747000	5750000	and sometimes you need someone else helping you to point it out to you
5750000	5754000	or another little trigger that says, hey, look, you've been playing.
5754000	5758000	Let me think of something else a lot of people are playing.
5758000	5759000	Fortnite.
5759000	5760000	Okay. Fortnite again.
5760000	5761000	Okay. Fortnite again.
5761000	5763000	You've been playing Fortnite for 11 hours.
5763000	5766000	Maybe it's time to, it's the cat paw.
5766000	5767000	Stop posting.
5767000	5768000	Stop playing.
5768000	5770000	You know, it's just.
5770000	5772000	Speaking of the cat paw, I saw Mr. Smoosh was.
5772000	5773000	He's got his foot in the air.
5773000	5774000	He's been doing.
5774000	5776000	He's been just off cam right now.
5776000	5777000	He's doing the booty licks.
5777000	5778000	Relaxing. Yeah.
5778000	5783000	But at any rate, you know, there comes a point where if you can't do it for yourself,
5783000	5785000	someone's going to have to do it for you.
5785000	5786000	Yeah.
5786000	5789000	And that's why I think it's good that this decision is being made,
5789000	5791000	that there's going to be literature that goes out.
5791000	5797000	You know, the one thing is that you can be a fan of something and still take a very critical eye to it.
5797000	5801000	In fact, I think that's what makes a better fan.
5801000	5803000	I like to think that's what this show is.
5803000	5804000	Yeah.
5804000	5805000	When we're critical of things.
5805000	5806000	Girl, it's us.
5806000	5807000	Yeah, it's us.
5807000	5813000	But anyway, but my, but my thought about it is, is like, you know, for example, I'm going to use David Bowie.
5813000	5814000	Okay.
5814000	5817000	David Bowie, amazing, amazing artist.
5817000	5820000	Such a visionary, right?
5820000	5823000	But he also slept with an underage girl.
5823000	5830000	We can look at that problematic behavior and still recognize that he was a creative genius.
5830000	5832000	You know, we can do that.
5832000	5841000	That is what I think makes the truest of fans is when you're not just accepting everything blindly like religion.
5841000	5845000	It's good when you can follow a religion and still take a critical eye toward it.
5845000	5847000	That way you make it better.
5847000	5848000	Same with video games.
5848000	5849000	Same with anything.
5849000	5852000	And I really that's why I'm glad about this.
5852000	5854000	I really am glad about it.
5854000	5864000	You know, I, I'm going to go into a rant on this one because like for you, for example, you know, I'm active in our local LGBT community.
5864000	5865000	I support them.
5865000	5871000	I do a lot of work and I can still point out the rampant misogyny going on in the community right now.
5871000	5872000	Oh, sure.
5872000	5873000	Oh, my God.
5873000	5887000	Like, and one thing maybe you haven't seen, but I've certainly seen firsthand, like if you go on to like meeting people on gay apps, like, you know, the grinders, the scruffs, things of that world, you see like racism, you know, gender.
5887000	5888000	No fats, no femmes, no Asians.
5888000	5889000	Oh, absolutely.
5889000	5890000	That's a real thing.
5890000	5892000	That's not like just some things a queen said on Drag Race.
5892000	5898000	They said that because that is a thing people will put on their profiles or, you know, like, you know, please no black guys.
5898000	5900000	Or what the hell is that?
5900000	5902000	Or don't be HIV positive.
5902000	5903000	Yeah.
5903000	5904000	That's another big one.
5904000	5905000	It's discriminatory.
5905000	5906000	A clean guys only.
5906000	5907000	Yeah.
5907000	5908000	As if HIV is a dirty thing.
5908000	5909000	You know what?
5909000	5911000	Those people are fucking bigots and I will call them out on it.
5911000	5917000	It sucks, you know, and maybe, maybe, well, I don't, there, I would, maybe I'm being too nice.
5917000	5918000	I don't know.
5918000	5925000	But I would say that as a person doing a bigoted thing that I would say probably 95% of those people you kind of educate, like, you know, when you say that it comes off.
5925000	5927000	Would a non bigoted person say that?
5927000	5928000	Exactly.
5929000	5934000	And then you kind of point out, you know, the behavior of 95% of people I bet would say, oh, fuck, that's not what I meant, like, at all.
5934000	5935000	And they're going to change that.
5935000	5941000	There's going to be the 5% that are just fucking up their own ass and they're never, literally, and they're not going to change.
5941000	5949000	And that's why me, I am a very public feminist in queer spaces because this attention is needed.
5949000	5953000	And I feel the same way, you know, anything that I love, I'm going to work to try to make it better.
5953000	5959000	And so I, I know people will be like, oh, well, if you support this thing, then you don't love video games.
5959000	5964000	And like, no, I do it because I love video games and I want them to continue to be safe and fun for everybody.
5964000	5966000	Can I give one other example?
5966000	5970000	I know it's a little bit off topic, but I do think it's important, like talking about like the misogyny in gay culture.
5970000	5973000	So have you ever heard of like a gold star gay?
5973000	5975000	You know what a gold star gay is?
5975000	5978000	A gold star gay is a gay that was born by C-section.
5978000	5981000	Oh, didn't come out of the vagina.
5982000	5985000	So, you know, that's isn't that stupid?
5985000	5987000	Yeah, I know that term.
5987000	5992000	Right. Right. And now that you hear that and then when you hear that really is it's like that is the dumbest thing I've ever heard.
5992000	5998000	People also treat cisgender male as the default in in language.
5998000	6005000	There's a book I've been reading by an Australian scholar named Dale Spender.
6005000	6011000	She's named Dale Spender, by the way, called Man Made Language, where language is used in a certain way.
6011000	6018000	But anything that goes towards women are automatically considered nonstandard, different, negative.
6018000	6024000	Like the word spinster, for an example, started from a woman who went to work for herself spinning.
6024000	6030000	Now it's got this negative connotation of this woman unmarried who's never had babies or whatever.
6030000	6035000	Just an example of that. But we look at being this one way as the default.
6035000	6037000	So even anyway, I'm sorry.
6037000	6048000	And I think it's important to point out that even within minorities, in this case, we're talking about, you know, with sexuality and sexual identity, even within those types of cultures, you can have issues that need to be worked on.
6048000	6052000	It's not it's not just a cis white man problem.
6052000	6056000	I mean, don't get this wrong. There's lots of problems there, too, but it's an everybody problem.
6056000	6060000	I had a gay man grab my boob and says, it's OK, I'm gay. No, it's not.
6060000	6065000	You touched me without my permission. And I hope you like my elbow in your gut.
6065000	6071000	No, if anyone grabs me without my permission, I look at that as explicit permission for me to counter grab.
6071000	6074000	Painfully. Just saying.
6074000	6078000	You know, but anyway, you know, the other thing, too, like with with Alabama, I love my home state.
6078000	6082000	I'm glad I grew up there, but it's fucking terrible what's going on.
6082000	6086000	And I am pissed and I am going to be part of the uterine underground.
6086000	6090000	Let me I'm sorry before we get off the rails too much. No, I want to get our next story in our classic of the week.
6090000	6094000	But Bob Coffey asked an important question in chat that I think a lot of people don't know.
6094000	6098000	So let's out of a place of love, let's educate. Let's assist. What is this gender male anyway?
6098000	6108000	It just means it probably you. I'm going to guess you were assigned male at birth and maintained being male or female at birth and maintained being male.
6108000	6112000	It's the opposite of transgender. That's it. So.
6112000	6118000	And before people say that's a made up term, I'm sorry, they're both Latin suits.
6118000	6124000	No, it's not made up anyhow. Oh, and and Pixel Pacas also said born.
6124000	6127000	Oh, no, never mind, because I said male anyway. But yeah.
6127000	6135000	So but it would mean you associate with the gender you were assigned to birth, which is, to be fair, most people.
6135000	6139000	Yeah. And that doesn't but that doesn't mean if you're not one of those people, it's bad.
6139000	6146000	It's just and and you can use that privilege that you have to help the people who do not have that privilege.
6146000	6151000	All right. Anyway, sorry. I know this talking about video game addiction.
6151000	6154000	Yes, I know. No, it's but it also goes about our lives, too.
6154000	6158000	But it also goes back to supporting the things you love in a constructive manner.
6158000	6160000	Yeah. You and I deal with this stuff all the time.
6160000	6167000	Me as a gay guy, you as someone who has talked about your asexuality on the show and the assumptions that people make with that, like it's a, you know, a big deal.
6167000	6171000	So anyway, let's move on, though. And one last thing.
6171000	6177000	Yeah. Bones 006 says, I find it funny that a gay male or female can grab and touch the other gender and claim it's OK because I am gay.
6177000	6182000	It is not OK. It is never OK. And you see that happen. You call it the fuck out.
6182000	6189000	Yeah, no, it's it's. Do you remember on. OK, so you guys know I'm a reality TV nerd, right?
6189000	6195000	So I like shows like Survivor. So they're going to be doing an all winners edition.
6195000	6201000	Season 40 is coming up where all the winners are going to be like some of the winners are going to be asked to play, but not all of them got asked back.
6201000	6206000	And one of the winners, apparently, if spoilers are to be believed, did not get asked back is the original winner, Richard Hatch.
6206000	6211000	And some people were wondering, why was he not asked back? And somebody very eloquently pointed out on Reddit.
6211000	6222000	Do you remember when he came back for All-Stars and he's a gay guy, by the way, when he came back on All-Stars, he was he did a challenge naked and rubbed his parts against a woman to throw her off her game.
6222000	6229000	So. Oh, my God. Right. So that's disgusting. Right. That is the reason he was not asked back.
6229000	6237000	Because he's a disgusting person. It was not a nice thing. No. Anyone who does something like that without consent, you are immediately the scum of the earth.
6237000	6240000	And it's sorry, as you know, Matt says, I forgot about that.
6240000	6245000	But a lot of people did because All-Stars was on in what, like two thousand four.
6245000	6250000	It was a long time ago because what survivors started what, two thousand, I think the first All-Star season was like two thousand three, two thousand four.
6250000	6256000	We weren't talking about this shit then. But thanks to, you know, the Me Too movement and things like that, we're talking about it more now.
6256000	6258000	You know, the show dealt with it in its own way back then.
6258000	6263000	I did with all the people who said that I need to stop talking and go back to the kitchen.
6263000	6267000	Guess who's still here. Seventeen years later, bitches.
6267000	6272000	You know what? I may not have as much left to my ass as I did when I started, but y'all can bite it.
6272000	6275000	All right. Unless, you know, you have to ask first.
6275000	6278000	Let's move on. Let's move on. There's plenty more to talk about.
6278000	6282000	Loki, let's talk about Pokemon. Pokemon games, games, Pokemon, Pokemon game.
6282000	6291000	Yes. So Pokemon Rumble Rush is a game that's going to be coming to iOS and Android soon.
6291000	6298000	Yeah. And right now the official Japanese site says it's coming soon.
6298000	6306000	But apparently other regions have the game is coming out in those areas as well.
6306000	6314000	And there's even a description on the Google Play Store talking about, you know, enjoy fast paced gameplay on the go.
6314000	6319000	And they talk about the different Pokemon you can upgrade and explore areas and stuff like that.
6319000	6322000	I've never played Pokemon Rumble. Isn't that the one that has the toy?
6322000	6325000	It's basically the toy Pokemon or something like that.
6325000	6328000	Like the kind of blocky ones. Right. Yeah.
6328000	6332000	That's right. Yeah. They had. Well, there was that one, too.
6332000	6337000	Yeah. They kind of look like little toys, I guess, if I remember correctly.
6337000	6341000	But so we kind of had heard rumblings about this like last week.
6341000	6343000	Right. Because didn't we hear that? Well, we heard that there was a new game.
6343000	6347000	I don't know if this is the other game that's being made by that one company.
6347000	6352000	Another other game or another other. Yes, exactly. Or a different game altogether.
6352000	6358000	So I don't know, because I would think it's weird that like we're announcing this partnership that we're going to make this game.
6358000	6360000	And then like the very next week, we're going to announce the game.
6360000	6364000	And you think you would just wait the week and now it's the game.
6364000	6370000	But we'll have to wait and see if there's anything else that's coming.
6370000	6373000	But I don't know. I'll check it out. I'm assuming it's gonna be free.
6373000	6378000	Yeah. So, yeah, you know, the free free to start is always a good way to sample.
6378000	6382000	I was like really into the other Pokemon game for a while.
6382000	6388000	I don't remember what was on the the switch and then it was also on Android as well.
6388000	6392000	And I played that quite a bit, but then I stopped because I got bored with it.
6392000	6397000	Shane is in our chat, Shad, saying Pokemon Rush is out in like Australia.
6397000	6400000	It's kind of like a Diablo and Skylanders just killed tons and tons of enemies.
6400000	6402000	Rumble has always been a fun game, though.
6402000	6404000	Well, that sounds just like the...
6404000	6406000	I don't know about the Australia, New Zealand people get all the cool mobile phone games.
6406000	6407000	Well, what's the other Pokemon game?
6407000	6412000	Because there's the other Pokemon game that you have like a group of Pokemon and you go and just kill enemies and stuff.
6412000	6415000	Yeah, it was on like 3DS. It was like a Diablo-esque type of game.
6415000	6418000	No, no, no, no. I'm talking about like the there's one that was on the switch.
6418000	6421000	It was a Pokemon game and they also have it on Android and iOS now.
6421000	6423000	But I remember it was called like the QB like...
6423000	6425000	Yeah. No, I know what you're talking about and I forget.
6425000	6426000	This is like different, but the same.
6426000	6427000	Yeah.
6427000	6428000	I guess.
6429000	6431000	All right. Oh, Pokemon Quest says Frodo.
6431000	6433000	Yes, yes, yes. Pokemon Quest.
6433000	6434000	Thank you, chat.
6434000	6436000	This is why we love having a live chat because they can live.
6436000	6437000	They can fact check us live on air.
6437000	6442000	Sometimes it's annoying, admittedly, but at the same time, you know, it keeps us keeps us real.
6442000	6443000	So what can we do?
6443000	6444000	All right.
6444000	6445000	Let's move on.
6445000	6452000	And before we get to our classic soundtrack of the month, because we're almost out of time in May with this being our last show in May, believe it or not, we got to get the soundtrack.
6452000	6454000	But before we do, I got one more story.
6454000	6456000	And it's about Netflix, which I brought up earlier in the show.
6456000	6464000	But, you know, Netflix, they not only have lots and lots of new shows, they keep seeing ads for new shows, but they're kind of getting into gaming as well.
6464000	6467000	In fact, we know that a Stranger Things game is on the way.
6467000	6469000	That's that's not news that has already been out there.
6469000	6473000	We knew that a Stranger Things game was coming out around the time that season three starts in July.
6473000	6481000	But apparently because brands are hip and cool on Twitter now and they interact with each other on social media, which is weird.
6481000	6489000	But due to a recent social media interaction where E3's replied to Netflix saying, sounds great, can we get a hint about the game?
6489000	6496000	Netflix replied saying, of course, there's the upcoming Stranger Things game, but hmm, there's definitely more to come.
6496000	6500000	So it seems like Netflix could be unveiling other games.
6500000	6504000	I would love like if they're like, can we get a hint about the new game?
6504000	6507000	They're like, no, fuck off.
6507000	6509000	If the brands responded that way.
6509000	6510000	Saying who the fuck are you?
6510000	6513000	Yeah, no. So who knows what Netflix might be working on?
6513000	6516000	Maybe a Black Mirror video game. That would be pretty rad, actually.
6516000	6520000	I'd be so as much as it would probably terrify me, like I'd be into that.
6520000	6525000	Or, well, they have the new season, which is like three fucking episodes coming.
6525000	6527000	Yeah, but then it's three episodes. Come on.
6527000	6534000	There was that Bandersnatch thing, too, which is kind of a game, kind of a game, kind of very, very rudimentary.
6534000	6538000	But yes, I mean, in some ways, I'm trying to think what else on Netflix would be.
6538000	6542000	I think what else on Netflix would kind of lend itself to being maybe Nailed It, the home version.
6545000	6549000	Why not? We had all those like we have that they have like these.
6549000	6555000	They seriously have like a cooking simulator game that's like VR that is basically nailed at the video game.
6556000	6559000	You can like actually set fire to the kitchen if you're not.
6559000	6562000	I just want a game where Nicole Byer narrates my life.
6564000	6566000	What is he doing?
6566000	6569000	I can't believe he's fucking that up again.
6569000	6572000	I just want a game where she narrates my life because I love it.
6572000	6581000	I want like an adult version, not like, you know, but like an adult language version of like one of those cooking shows.
6581000	6583000	What the fuck are you doing right now?
6583000	6585000	So you want Hell's Kitchen Uncensored.
6585000	6587000	Yes. Yes.
6587000	6590000	But like with just other people, you know, making cakes.
6590000	6597000	Something that's very like, you know, shouldn't be something that people are getting super mad over, but they are getting super mad over it.
6597000	6601000	As this Joe and Hunter Matt says, Overcooked can end up being like Nailed It.
6601000	6605000	Who knows? That's that's my vote for Netflix show I'd like to see a game made out of.
6605000	6609000	All right. Anyway, let's go. You know what? Let's go back to a simpler time.
6609000	6617000	We're going to go back to a time when, you know, video games were not based on streaming technology because you know how you watch movies and shows.
6617000	6620000	You rented them on VHS from Blockbuster.
6620000	6624000	It's the classic Game of the Week segment. But once a month, Dark Soccer says, you know what?
6624000	6629000	I'm going to mix it up a little bit. And instead of doing a whole game, I want to talk about a soundtrack.
6629000	6634000	I want to focus on a spotlight on a soundtrack. And I believe the rule was in twenty nineteen.
6634000	6637000	She's going to be focusing on 8-bit soundtrack specifically.
6637000	6641000	I am. And let's see, in January we had a Nintendo game. We had a Nintendo game in February, Nintendo game in March.
6641000	6644000	So what Nintendo game did you do this month? I didn't.
6644000	6645000	The Gasp.
6645000	6647000	And in fact, next month's also will not be.
6647000	6650000	I see. All right. Well, then what did you pick for the classic soundtrack of the month?
6650000	6656000	Wonder Boy 3, the Dragon's Trap, which actually is, I'd say, pretty timely.
6656000	6662000	We've had other Wonder Boy. We've had that Wonder Boy re-release of this game that had very good versions of the music.
6662000	6667000	That was really like one of my favorite retro re-releases they've done. They did such a good job with that.
6667000	6678000	Well, at any rate, the music designer for this was Sakamoto Shimichi, who actually spent a lot of time working for Westone.
6678000	6687000	And he also helped program NMK's NES sound driver and programmed his own.
6687000	6690000	Right now he's doing audio for smartphone games, just saying.
6690000	6695000	But he has worked on a lot of great music, a lot of great games.
6695000	6698000	There was Star Force, of course, Wonder Boy in Monster Land.
6698000	6704000	Bikuriman World for PC Engine, he's done other Wonder Boy games.
6704000	6706000	He's actually done several Wonder Boy games.
6706000	6712000	Dragon's Curse, you know, just all kinds of really neat games.
6712000	6717000	But at any rate, the music for this game really stands out with it.
6717000	6723000	Because it was really one of the outstanding things with this game.
6724000	6730000	When the Games Machine did their... I'm sorry, not the Games Machine.
6730000	6740000	Raze actually did a review of this. They noted that the music was worth listening through headphones.
6740000	6747000	And, of course, the music was referred to as incredibly addictive by other places.
6747000	6755000	Because it really has been that the music for this game fit the play so well that the two could not go without each other.
6755000	6761000	And I think that one of the selections that I had chosen to play back was the FM soundtrack.
6761000	6764000	This is definitely one of those games that had...
6764000	6767000	And for people who don't know this, which I don't know how you couldn't know this,
6767000	6776000	but Master System in Japan had another sound processor that was their FM sound processor.
6776000	6783000	And so they had basically better soundtracks for the games, more channels to play the music through.
6783000	6787000	Where what we got from Master System over here was just kind of dinky.
6787000	6789000	It wasn't bad, just kind of dinky.
6789000	6795000	And, of course, if you were playing through a power-based converter, then it wouldn't play games in FM sound.
6795000	6800000	There are, of course, third-party power-based converters now that will play in FM sound.
6800000	6801000	We have one.
6801000	6810000	But Monster Boy, this particular game, was not one that works in one of those FM-compatible power-based converters.
6810000	6814000	You have to play it on an FM-capable machine.
6814000	6819000	So at any rate, you know, this is also...
6819000	6827000	I would even go on record saying that this is probably some of the pinnacle of Master System game music right here.
6827000	6832000	This is really one of the games that set apart what soundtracks could be like on Master System.
6832000	6839000	And I do want to point out, because the chat room was kind of disgusting, wait a minute, wasn't this on the TurboGrafx-16?
6839000	6840000	Yes.
6840000	6842000	Is that really 8-bit? But we're talking about the Master System right now.
6842000	6843000	I'm talking about the Master System 1.
6843000	6845000	That's just the gameplay you're seeing too.
6845000	6850000	And let's be real, this game has been remade so many times that, like you just said, it's on damn near everything now.
6850000	6854000	It's the same designer did the PC Engine music, by the way.
6854000	6862000	He did it for all of these versions of the games and the subsequent one, which was, I think, Wonder Boy in Monster...
6862000	6866000	No, that was the prequel to this, Wonder Boy in Monster Land, and then we had the Dragon's Trap.
6866000	6872000	But at any rate, that's all I can say is that it's got a really stellar soundtrack to it.
6872000	6876000	Definitely something that I've just sat and listened to before because it was good.
6876000	6877000	I've done that...
6877000	6882000	You know, for me to sit and actually listen to the soundtrack all the way through, I really have to like every piece of it.
6882000	6886000	And this is one of the ones that I do. So that's your classic soundtrack.
6886000	6895000	Alright. And yeah, a good choice because, you know, Wonder Boy 3 again is one of those games you can kind of go back and enjoy.
6895000	6900000	Not just on the TurboGrafx-16, but on basically all the modern day systems thanks to the remake.
6900000	6903000	Look how pretty it is too. Just the graphics were amazing.
6903000	6909000	Especially because a lot of Sega Master System games didn't look great, you know, but this one looks really good.
6910000	6917000	Yeah, although one thing I do like about the Master System is that they had a better pastel palette than the NES did.
6917000	6920000	NES was aimed a little bit more toward primary colors.
6920000	6927000	Master System, like Fantasy Zone on Master System is, I think, better than Fantasy Zone on NES.
6927000	6928000	That's it.
6928000	6934000	Well there it is, your classic soundtrack of the month for Wonder Boy 3, the Dragon's Trap on the Sega Master System.
6934000	6938000	To add one thing for DarkTetsuya, he says that the new game has the old visuals and music.
6938000	6947000	Yes, but apart from that, not only does it have the Master System music that people in the US remember, it has FM sound in it as well.
6947000	6954000	But it is, it also is a little deceiving because it also is kind of like built for widescreen when the original game wasn't.
6954000	6956000	So it is cheating a little bit, but honestly...
6956000	6958000	Well it's remade though, with the old style graphics.
6958000	6960000	And I don't mind that at all, honestly.
6960000	6966000	Like I would love to go back and play a lot of old retro games, like just kind of like rebuilt for modern TVs.
6966000	6972000	And there's people who complain about the retooling of the soundtrack for the, you know, the newer version.
6972000	6976000	I like it, so whatever. Stop complaining.
6976000	6980000	I know just because you thought something was old was better, but look at WoW.
6980000	6995000	Alright, well let's take a break. We're going to go to a pre-recorded segment that talks a little bit about Excitebike versus a new release that came out just this past week on the Nintendo NES Online for Nintendo Switch.
6995000	7006000	Hey everybody, so for our OLR Break Segment this week, we're back on the classic Nintendo Entertainment System Online library available on the Nintendo Switch.
7006000	7013000	To take a look at this month's game releases, which included a Classic Game of the Week from just a couple weeks ago.
7013000	7015000	Clu Clu Land is in here, as well as Donkey Kong Jr.
7015000	7021000	A special version of Star Soldier that starts you at the last level, because Star Soldier was one of last month's releases.
7021000	7027000	And then we have Versus Excitebike, which is kind of the interesting release I wanted to talk about for this month.
7027000	7036000	Because this isn't the first time that we've seen a Japanese-only game cross over into the North American Switch releases for the Nintendo system.
7036000	7043000	Because we had that last month with Super Mario Bros. The Lost Levels, which as we know, was really just Super Mario Bros. 2 in Japan.
7043000	7048000	So that's what it was released as. It's just basically the Super Mario Bros. 2 Japanese ROM.
7048000	7057000	But released over here in North America as The Lost Levels, which was the branding that it had in Mario All-Stars back on the Super Nintendo.
7057000	7060000	Although it had the reskinning of the game at that point too.
7060000	7067000	But anyway, Mario Lost Levels is so last month at this point, so what I really want to talk about is Versus Excitebike.
7067000	7076000	Because what makes this release interesting is that they could have just done regular Excitebike as we knew it here in the US.
7076000	7081000	Which I believe was one of the original launch games for the Nintendo when it first came out.
7081000	7087000	It was very soon after. It was one of those Black Pack releases, kind of like you see this Clu Clu Land over here.
7087000	7091000	They all had that very unique art style. You guys kind of know the original NES releases.
7091000	7098000	They didn't start looking very different until later on, which is why releases like Punch Out, Kirby, and some of those later releases had their own unique box art.
7098000	7103000	But it looked a little more, you know, all those NES games kind of looked the same, and Excitebike was that way too.
7104000	7109000	But Versus Excitebike was a Japanese Famicom disc game.
7109000	7117000	And you know that right off the bat because the little icon that looks like one of those little yellow discs, the little mascot, is right there in the upper left hand corner.
7117000	7121000	So that's how you know right off the bat that, hey, wait a minute, this is definitely a release.
7121000	7123000	I mean, obviously the Japanese text as well, hello.
7123000	7126000	But that's, you know, you kind of look at a few things there, like this is different.
7126000	7129000	This is not the same release that we got in the US.
7129000	7132000	So it is kind of interesting that we got Versus Excitebike instead.
7132000	7134000	So let's fire it up and take a look at it.
7134000	7141000	Now, I'm sure one of the things that people remember if you ever played Excitebike when it was released in the US is that you could create your own tracks.
7141000	7146000	And there were options there for saving and loading, but they didn't really do anything.
7146000	7154000	They didn't work because those options were obviously there for a Japanese release of the game that did allow you to save and load.
7154000	7160000	And then, of course, Excitebike came out in the arcades later on as the Versus system was kind of more of a different upgraded game.
7160000	7164000	You can see right here the copyright 1998. This was released later.
7164000	7167000	And sure, there's an edit mode in here as well.
7167000	7172000	And if we were to go into the edit mode, of course, we have to sit through loading screens now, which we weren't used to in the US.
7172000	7175000	But we can actually go in and we can edit a particular track if we want.
7175000	7179000	So let's say we want to edit, I don't know, we'll just edit track number four here.
7179000	7182000	OK, so it's already loaded in the system there.
7182000	7186000	If I want to, I think if I remember right, using the select button.
7186000	7189000	Yeah, we just we just eliminate all of track four.
7189000	7191000	Screw it. Yep, that's all we got.
7191000	7192000	That was a finish.
7192000	7200000	And if I want to make a track and instead of you'll notice in the original NES American release, it was A, B, C, D, E, F, G, like it shows you different letters.
7200000	7205000	But this one actually shows you, you know, crappy little pictures of what you're about to put down.
7205000	7213000	So if you're a big fan of these little flat hills like I am, maybe you just want to make a level that's filled with nothing but these little flat hills.
7213000	7216000	And why not a couple of arrows?
7216000	7219000	You know, we might have to cool down the tank a little bit.
7219000	7222000	And oh, I don't know, we'll do the big flying ones.
7222000	7224000	I love the flying ones.
7224000	7227000	Oh, wait, we need we need a clear path here after the fly one.
7227000	7230000	Let's do maybe we want to increase the number here.
7230000	7235000	Let's do a nice big break for eight.
7235000	7240000	It goes in only different powers there of two.
7240000	7244000	Let's try that again.
7244000	7245000	OK, good enough.
7245000	7248000	I don't need to spend all day here looking at this track in that segment.
7248000	7250000	But then you can actually run a test run.
7250000	7252000	Right.
7252000	7254000	And we can race the bike.
7255000	7258000	Just like you would, you know, with my slow, my fast.
7258000	7260000	Oh, yay, flat hills, my favorite.
7260000	7261000	Let's go.
7261000	7262000	I crashed.
7262000	7264000	OK, maybe they're not my favorite anymore.
7264000	7265000	All right, cool down.
7265000	7267000	Then these are definitely my favorite.
7267000	7269000	I almost broke the ceiling on that one.
7269000	7273000	OK, I like that track because I almost hit the ceiling so I can actually let's see.
7273000	7276000	I'm going to go back to the edit because if I hit continue, I'm just going to continue.
7276000	7281000	But then I can actually save and I can now save my track four.
7281000	7283000	So now track four is that.
7283000	7284000	It's that track.
7284000	7285000	So that's kind of neat.
7285000	7288000	And then you can I think you can kind of like copy.
7288000	7295000	You can kind of pull tracks down and save into other people's disks and so forth because they got this whole disk edit thing in there and so forth.
7295000	7306000	But then I think it's also worth talking about the game itself because the game itself, when you get into the site bike on the release here from the Famicom version of the game,
7306000	7309000	the disk system version of the game is that it's more like the arcade release.
7309000	7315000	So if you ever played a site bike in the arcade, you are really playing versus excite bike, which was a little different.
7315000	7316000	So let's actually go in and look here.
7316000	7320000	So again, it's got a load because it's a disk game.
7320000	7325000	When it comes up, you can choose my beginner, intermediate, advanced.
7325000	7328000	I'm going to pick Bobby Black Wolf mode and stick with beginner here.
7328000	7330000	And you get this whole, OK, it's interesting.
7330000	7332000	You kind of see the different tracks twice.
7332000	7336000	OK, so what happens is that first you're going to race it with nobody else.
7336000	7338000	So it's like a practice.
7338000	7340000	So let's do this.
7340000	7341000	So here I go.
7341000	7342000	I'm racing.
7342000	7343000	And what's interesting.
7343000	7345000	Well, for one, there's background music.
7345000	7347000	There wasn't background music in the original site bike.
7347000	7350000	Also, if I hit the fast button.
7350000	7354000	So like, you know how one button was just like a normal engine, but the other was like a fast engine.
7354000	7358000	You actually don't hear that higher pitch squeal.
7358000	7360000	You'll notice you're not hearing it.
7360000	7363000	You do notice my temperature gauge is going up a lot faster when I use it.
7363000	7367000	In fact, let me let me hammer down on that button.
7367000	7372000	There it is, because it's not until you get way too high that you'll hear that higher pitch.
7372000	7374000	Let me do it again.
7374000	7377000	OK, so it got a little right before I crossed the finish line there, got a little high pitch.
7377000	7379000	You saw my character was flashing there as well.
7379000	7385000	That's how you know that, you know, you're maybe lead footing on the heavy speed up gas a little too much.
7385000	7386000	All right.
7386000	7387000	So hurry.
7387000	7389000	I qualified for the regular race.
7389000	7390000	So now it's real excite bike.
7390000	7393000	So we're going to be racing against other bikers.
7393000	7394000	I'm going to come in number one.
7394000	7397000	I got to get one minute and 18 seconds.
7397000	7398000	So let's do it.
7398000	7399000	We're going to race here.
7399000	7400000	These are the bikers.
7400000	7401000	I can do it.
7401000	7402000	All right.
7402000	7403000	Wow.
7403000	7404000	They really took off.
7404000	7407000	But the funny thing is these other bikers, it's not like when you're playing Mario Kart
7407000	7410000	and you're racing like actually like Mario and Princess Peach and stuff.
7410000	7416000	These bikers, they're just there to get your way, because what it really comes down to is your time.
7416000	7418000	Nothing else matters, but your time.
7418000	7420000	Although you can screw these other racers if you want.
7420000	7424000	If you're able to kind of like change a lane right.
7424000	7425000	There you go.
7425000	7429000	See, see how I crashed that guy by changing a lane right on top of him.
7429000	7430000	As long as you are in front of him.
7430000	7432000	See, that one didn't work out so well.
7432000	7438000	But as long as you're in front of him when you do it, then you crash him and it's really satisfying.
7438000	7439000	So let's see.
7439000	7440000	Oops, I'm overheating here.
7440000	7441000	I'm going too fast.
7441000	7447000	What I try to do, I usually go the normal and then like right before a hop, I'll hit the super accelerate.
7447000	7449000	Oh, that didn't work out so well.
7449000	7452000	I'm really out of practice on this, you guys.
7452000	7463000	But hopefully, see, we really fly with the super heavy foot there.
7463000	7466000	And almost to the end.
7466000	7471000	Sadly, you can't run the people over as they're running to their bikes as amazingly satisfactory as that would be.
7471000	7472000	But all right, we did it.
7472000	7476000	And we got 107, which was enough for first place.
7476000	7477000	And look at that.
7477000	7482000	You even have like a winner's podium with five places, not three like you usually see in the Olympics and stuff, but whatever.
7482000	7484000	So you have like a five person podium there.
7484000	7486000	And congratulations.
7486000	7490000	I got first place on track one and a really high pitched whale to go with it.
7490000	7492000	Sorry about that, but it's the game's fault, not mine.
7492000	7496000	So now we can go on to track number two and race that way.
7496000	7497000	But there you go.
7497000	7504000	I want to show you a look at versus excite bike and how it's a little bit different from the regular excite bike that many of you grew up with and were used to.
7504000	7510000	Unless you had access to the Famicom Disk System or you played this a lot in the arcade, you might not have seen this before.
7510000	7518000	So kind of a different release there on the Nintendo Entertainment System Classic Online Library or Nesflix.
7518000	7520000	It's called Nesflix for short on the Nintendo Switch.
7520000	7526000	Anyway, back to the studio live.
7526000	7527000	All right.
7527000	7528000	Thank you, me, for that segment.
7528000	7530000	Appreciate that.
7531000	7534000	Look there at excite bike versus so dark soccer.
7534000	7536000	Did you ever play the versus excite bike?
7536000	7538000	I know you're a big retro person back in the day.
7538000	7540000	Yeah, I remember playing in the arcades.
7540000	7542000	But, you know, I always kind of forgot.
7542000	7545000	Oh, yeah. In Japan, they got like this whole version of that released over there.
7545000	7546000	Yeah.
7546000	7552000	Anyway, for our next little segment here, one of our favorite contributors here, orange on trade.
7552000	7558000	You wanted to come onto the show tonight and actually talk to us about some things that are going on in his world.
7558000	7560000	So we wanted to welcome him onto the show tonight.
7560000	7562000	Hey, why are you there with us?
7562000	7564000	I have my own world. Really?
7564000	7573000	Yeah. Well, I guess are the worlds of bungee ferret tossing and a stacked snake 360.
7573000	7574000	Why can't it falling?
7574000	7576000	Are you suggesting a YY our cinematic universe?
7576000	7577000	Yes.
7577000	7581000	Is there a YY our.
7581000	7587000	I haven't really thought into it that much, to be honest.
7587000	7594000	Maybe someday, maybe maybe that's what we're slowly working towards is a game that combines all your other pre made game.
7594000	7600000	See, I'm here to speak to you about the sneak 360 initiative.
7600000	7603000	So what is on your mind tonight? What's new in your world?
7603000	7610000	Well, I mean, this this whole time flies thing is absolutely ridiculous.
7610000	7614000	I mean, here we are on episode 777 of the show.
7614000	7615000	Right.
7615000	7616000	Yeah.
7616000	7621000	Yeah. Snake 360 came out in November of 2008.
7621000	7623000	So it's been over 10 years now.
7623000	7626000	So it's just and and let me tell you something.
7626000	7629000	It's eligible for classic game of the week.
7629000	7630000	Yes.
7630000	7631000	Intent.
7631000	7633000	Nudge, nudge, wink, wink.
7633000	7634000	But let me tell you something else.
7634000	7637000	You know how and you know what?
7637000	7640000	I have a feeling Loki will agree with me on this.
7641000	7646000	You know how every parent or so many parents say, well, they grow up so fast.
7646000	7648000	I have an 11 month old now.
7648000	7650000	You believe it?
7650000	7656000	I know in just another month, you'll no longer be referring to it in months because it will be years.
7656000	7657000	It's so interesting.
7657000	7661000	Your own child is so close to, you know, my good pal, Melody.
7661000	7663000	And she's married to Mel B.
7663000	7665000	A lot of the DDR folks from Freestyle.
7665000	7667000	They did not name their kid.
7667000	7670000	No, they did not name their kid now, but they their baby.
7670000	7673000	I just went to the first birthday party like, wow.
7673000	7674000	Yeah.
7674000	7675000	So they're not that far apart.
7675000	7676000	I don't know.
7676000	7684000	My one hundred and two month year old one hundred and two month old.
7684000	7685000	That's very funny.
7685000	7690000	But no, it's like I honestly believe you don't really see that until you have a child yourself.
7690000	7696000	Just how quickly, you know, it's like already there are things she used to do that she doesn't do anymore.
7696000	7699000	And then it's it's scary.
7699000	7702000	Like she points at exit signs.
7702000	7704000	She makes all kinds of babbles.
7704000	7706000	She points at stop signs.
7706000	7709000	She has strong preferences for certain things.
7709000	7711000	Also, she's played a video game.
7711000	7715000	I was going to say, well, my friend, I won't be having kids ever.
7715000	7718000	So I'll live vicariously through the rest of you.
7718000	7720000	You know what?
7720000	7728000	I've talked to some people who are like, that's the best way, because it's like you get to hang out with your friends and, you know, other people who have kids.
7728000	7729000	You get to hang out with them.
7729000	7730000	You get to spoil them.
7730000	7735000	You get to, you know, spend time with them and then you get to go home and it's somebody else's problem.
7735000	7739000	For the record, I'm five hundred and seventeen months old right now.
7739000	7742000	Happy birthday.
7742000	7743000	Anyway, sorry.
7743000	7744000	Yeah.
7744000	7745000	Playing your first video game.
7746000	7749000	So, actually, you know what?
7749000	7755000	I'll just skip to this because I have a list, but I'm going to skip to announcing Sharpshooter Plus.
7755000	7767000	This is the first video game that my daughter, Annie, has played because the previous version, it only allowed you to play with a game controller.
7767000	7777000	And now the new version allows you to also play with your mouse or, if you have one connected, a touch screen.
7777000	7788000	And by the way, I just posted a link in chat to a video of the previous version, so feel free to put that up or do whatever with it.
7788000	7795000	Unlike Bobby, I can't do the YouTubes live because I don't have a dual monitor, so I'll just have to rely on the chatters to go look at that.
7795000	7796000	We should fix that.
7796000	7800000	That is a future OLR upgrade. It's on the list.
7800000	7808000	But yeah, Sharpshooter is basically, and it was actually one of my most popular games on 360.
7808000	7812000	It is a straight up hardcore skills test.
7812000	7823000	It is just you and 20 target shooting mini games, and you just try to do as well as you can, try for the highest score, try for the best grade.
7823000	7829000	The ultimate goal of the game is to play the master difficulty and to get the highest grade of AAA.
7829000	7832000	And it is absolutely not easy.
7832000	7845000	And if you've been, you know, playing slow paced RPGs or, you know, first person shooters and you've let those hardcore arcade gaming skills dull, you're going to have an uphill climb ahead of you.
7845000	7851000	So Dartatia in chat says, so sort of like point blank, I would say this is more like police trainer.
7851000	7854000	Hogan's Alley is the one that it kind of reminds me of.
7854000	7864000	Well, I mean, police trainer, let's face it, police trainer was basically point blank with not as good graphics or more fun imagination.
7864000	7866000	But I mean, I'll tell you this.
7866000	7872000	Sharpshooter is basically my point blank, but it has even worse graphics than police trainer.
7872000	7876000	That being said, it is a fun game.
7876000	7878000	I wouldn't put it out if it wasn't.
7878000	7890000	And I have spent a lot of time carefully tuning the difficulty and for the mouse and the touch screen input settings, the difficulty is tuned completely differently.
7890000	7894000	So it is absolutely tailored to how you're playing it.
7894000	7899000	And the difficulty also automatically adjusts as you're playing based on how you're doing.
7899000	7903000	And the better you're doing, the more opportunities for score there are.
7903000	7909000	So you're just going to want to hit everything, never miss, never fail if you want the highest score.
7909000	7916000	Yeah, I'm actually I got to admit, I do remember when you put this game out on Xbox Live, but I kind of you know, I didn't get I'm going to be honest.
7916000	7921000	I didn't get as into this one as some of your other releases because it was more controller.
7921000	7923000	And that's kind of hard. That's a hard thing to emulate.
7923000	7928000	So I think now that you got the mouse and keyboard as well as like the touch, that's that's a game changer.
7928000	7932000	That's going to be like, OK, like now I'm imagining playing this with mouse and keyboard.
7932000	7935000	I am watching the video that you brought up. Imagine playing this mouse and keyboard.
7935000	7938000	I'm like, oh, this can be fun. And it's just mouse, by the way.
7938000	7942000	You can put your keyboard away. Right. Of course.
7942000	7945000	Because you just click to fire. You don't necessarily have to hit the spacebar.
7945000	7950000	I don't know why. By default, I always say mouse and keyboard. But of course, yes, just your mouse.
7950000	7956000	And let me tell you something, too, because if you play on touch screen, you would, of course, think, well,
7956000	7961000	I mean, I don't have to aim and I can just tap the targets. That sounds really easy.
7961000	7967000	Yeah, I thought of that. It is much more challenging when playing on touch screen.
7967000	7972000	The quotas are way higher. Things move a lot faster. It is so much fun.
7972000	7978000	I had a lot of fun implementing and playing and testing this thing.
7978000	7983000	I am so excited to check this out, so I'm assuming your release platform is Steam loading itself to the mouse.
7983000	7987000	It is. And you know what? I'm going to go ahead and say it.
7987000	7996000	All future YYR Games releases on PC and Mac will be exclusive to Steam and will never be on the Epic Games Store.
7996000	8002000	All right. I'm sure that news this week did them no favors in that regard.
8002000	8007000	I know. I know. They're trembling in their boots right now, I would imagine.
8007000	8016000	Hey, I'm still rooting for you to get the development on the you-know-what that's coming out in the, you know, near future 2020.
8016000	8024000	And maybe people will care, you know, when they start discovering your brilliant games, because I still say super multitasking.
8024000	8032000	Like the game is so flipping good. I don't know why it is not like a streamer's, like, go to it. It's so fun.
8032000	8040000	Well, I am planning to try to put some more effort into promotion over the coming months, because honestly I haven't done much with it.
8040000	8043000	Well, you've kind of had a baby.
8043000	8045000	That, yeah.
8045000	8048000	That'll get in the way, but in a good way.
8048000	8055000	I definitely am planning to do more as far as promotion, and part of that is I'm going to put together some videos.
8055000	8064000	And the first of it is going to be a series of retrospectives about what I've been up to over the last 10 years.
8064000	8069000	I actually was recording footage for some of these over the weekend.
8069000	8075000	Let me tell you something. I took out my Commodore that I've had for over 30 years now.
8075000	8082000	And I loaded up Gary Kitchen's Game Maker, which was my favorite thing on the Commodore 64.
8082000	8088000	This thing was genius. It was way ahead of its time. Published by Activision in 1985.
8088000	8096000	This thing had a built-in programming language, and you picked the commands from a menu rather than having to remember them.
8096000	8105000	It had a built-in sprite creator, sound maker, music maker, and it let you just kind of put everything all together.
8105000	8110000	Let me tell you something. This thing was so much fun to use, but oh my god. I had no idea.
8110000	8115000	I completely forgot about some of the absolute garbage that I created on that thing.
8115000	8121000	And you will see some of the embarrassings when I release the video.
8121000	8125000	It'll be right on the front page of yyrgames.com if you're interested.
8125000	8130000	I can't wait. So you know the other question I have to ask, or I would be a terrible video game commentator.
8130000	8134000	Do you have any idea what type of release window we're looking at for Sharpshooter Plus?
8134000	8141000	Oh yeah, early summer. I was hoping to have it out by this month actually, but you know, real life.
8141000	8152000	So probably either late June or early July. But that's not it. I have one more release planned for this summer.
8152000	8159000	Oh, wow. I feel like we're at an E3 fucking press conference right now. This is great. That's not all.
8159000	8164000	So I would love to announce Bungie Ferret Tossing 1.5.
8164000	8167000	Yay, our fave!
8167000	8176000	It is coming back. It's going to have improved graphics, and I mean that's a low bar because the first one didn't look all that great.
8176000	8186000	But now this time I have Amy with me, and she is much more of an artist than I, and she's going to be coaching me through improving the graphics somewhat.
8186000	8195000	So expect more animation and just things will look better. But I'm not going to stop at just the graphics.
8195000	8200000	So who played Mars Matrix on either Arcade or Dreamcast?
8200000	8206000	I have Mars Matrix on Dreamcast and have played a relatively okay amount of it.
8206000	8215000	I figured you would answer that. You did. So do you remember that Mars Matrix on Dreamcast had an arrange mode,
8215000	8224000	where basically you could, by playing the game, earn points and then spend them in an item shop to be able to unlock tweaks,
8224000	8231000	and then you could just kind of adjust the game however you wanted. You could make the combo timer longer.
8231000	8236000	You could increase the speed of everything. You could just make all kinds of different tweaks.
8236000	8243000	Well, I'm ripping a page out of that book, and that is going to be one of the major new features of Bungie Ferret Tossing 1.5.
8243000	8255000	I'm going to call it remix mode, and you are going to be able to adjust literally 18 different things from things that really affect the game,
8255000	8264000	like what HP the enemies have and you have, to the speed of your helicopter, to absolutely ridiculous and silly things,
8264000	8269000	like the amount of blood particles, the gravity.
8269000	8272000	What about ferret shrieking?
8272000	8278000	Well, actually, that was already adjustable. If you go to the options menu, you can adjust how frequently...
8278000	8281000	I mean like different shrieks.
8281000	8286000	Oh, well, I'll record some new shrieks just for you.
8286000	8291000	I think it would be funny to like be able to choose like high pitched or rawr, you know.
8291000	8292000	You know, I'm watching this video.
8292000	8293000	Oh, pitch.
8293000	8299000	I'm watching this video that you put in chat of hitstun getting like a high score in the game, and you know, I have to admit,
8299000	8303000	it's been a little while since I've kind of, you know, because this was back on the 360.
8303000	8309000	It's been a little while since I've really seen this, and I'm still just blown away that like this actually happened.
8309000	8311000	Like, you know what I mean?
8311000	8314000	Like, it's just so fun to watch. It's great.
8314000	8320000	And it's a legitimate like bullet dodging, action packed experience.
8320000	8327000	And so, this is also going to be the very first YYR Games title with DLC.
8327000	8329000	Ooh.
8329000	8333000	I mean, don't get too excited. I only really have two things.
8334000	8341000	Which actually is created by the very same person I mentioned in chat earlier who works IT for Jersey Jack.
8341000	8348000	So, it'll be really easy to get in touch with him and see if he has anything to share with you.
8348000	8356000	But yeah, the soundtrack is great, and he's actually thinking of making a remixed soundtrack for this version.
8356000	8360000	So, you know, it'll be great if you like the music.
8360000	8363000	You'll be able to buy it probably for like one or two bucks.
8363000	8369000	And then, also, for those people who either don't have time or are very lazy,
8369000	8374000	I'm planning to have a DLC item called I'm Lazy, Here's a Dollar.
8375000	8378000	And it will unlock everything for you.
8381000	8383000	I'm lazy, here's a dollar.
8383000	8384000	I approve.
8384000	8387000	I like that you're just calling it what it is.
8388000	8396000	And I mean, really, the remix options, I think it'll be for those people that are, you know,
8396000	8400000	they don't have time or they just don't feel like it, yeah, they can pay a dollar.
8400000	8406000	But for everybody else, I think it'll be a fun puzzle to figure out which options, you know,
8406000	8409000	adjusting them which way will allow you to increase your score.
8409000	8415000	Because one of the questions I got about the first one, because the score is measured in money because America.
8415000	8420000	But so many people at conventions ask me, what will you do with the money?
8420000	8422000	And I'm like, well, it's just your score.
8422000	8425000	And they're like, oh, but now there's something you can do with the money.
8425000	8427000	You can spend it on these unlocks.
8428000	8431000	Or you can just be lazy and give you a dollar.
8432000	8434000	Or you can just be lazy and give me a dollar.
8434000	8436000	I won't turn it away.
8437000	8441000	By the way, your DLC is getting a huge response in chat in a good way.
8444000	8445000	Nice.
8445000	8446000	I love it.
8446000	8449000	Let's see. SheHulk10 is asking, though, on Xbox One, question mark?
8449000	8451000	But this is all Steam, right?
8452000	8454000	For the moment, it is all Steam.
8454000	8462000	However, because of the Xbox One Creators Program and the fact that, you know, you don't need any concept approval,
8462000	8472000	I am planning to bring Falling+, Sharp Shooter+, and Bungie Ferretossing 1.5 all to Xbox One,
8472000	8478000	hopefully this year, for the same price and with the same features as the Steam releases,
8478000	8481000	except for achievements, because we're not allowed to have those on Creators Program.
8481000	8483000	Right. All right. Fair enough.
8484000	8485000	I'm so excited.
8485000	8489000	Yeah, I can't wait to experience these games again on PC.
8489000	8493000	I'm so happy for you as an indie developer.
8493000	8496000	I know these games are not bringing trucks full of money to your house.
8496000	8497000	But you know what?
8497000	8500000	I think the people that do discover them enjoy them,
8500000	8504000	especially because, you know, you very much reasonably price these games.
8504000	8506000	And I think they're a lot of fun.
8506000	8511000	And obviously, I'm always going to be a little partial to you because you've been such a supporter of the show over the years.
8512000	8513000	Well, what's not to support?
8514000	8515000	It's a great show.
8515000	8517000	I really appreciate that.
8517000	8519000	And you do great stuff with your games.
8519000	8521000	So, well, best of luck to you with these releases.
8521000	8528000	Obviously, when we know the exact days, we'll be sure to relay that information here at OLR and let people know.
8529000	8531000	But while we are, I am going to get back to the rest of the show.
8531000	8535000	Is there anything else you want to part ways with here?
8536000	8541000	Well, actually, I was thinking of sending an email, but I figured I'll just chime in on this.
8541000	8544000	I may let you have your Drag Race time this week.
8545000	8554000	About the loot box topic from last week's show, I feel like there's something that the platform holders could definitely do
8554000	8560000	that wouldn't probably be all that difficult to implement and probably would make a big difference.
8560000	8564000	If you go to the PlayStation Store, you know how they have like, well, this is a game.
8564000	8567000	This is add-on content. This is demo. This is video.
8568000	8574000	They could create a category called virtual currency or something like that.
8574000	8579000	And it's like whenever you go and buy add-on content for a game, you get a warning.
8579000	8582000	Yeah, so you need this game in order to use this.
8582000	8589000	And if you own this game on PlayStation Plus and you lose access to it, you won't be able to use the add-on content anymore.
8589000	8592000	They're very good about warning you about that.
8592000	8598000	Why not warn people, okay, so you're about to buy virtual currency that can be spent on this game.
8598000	8602000	It can only be used in this game. It is not worth money. There are no refunds.
8602000	8608000	And you may be able to spend it on luck-based items.
8609000	8610000	Why not that?
8610000	8615000	Yeah, I like that idea of bringing more visibility to it right there in the store.
8615000	8619000	I know you're kind of going a slightly different direction, but maybe just kind of calling out,
8619000	8622000	this game has loot boxes. This game has currency in it.
8622000	8625000	It's kind of like an extra step that the stores can do.
8625000	8631000	Because again, I feel like if the developers aren't going to kind of regulate it, then the stores kind of have to do it.
8631000	8634000	And if they don't do it, that's when the government's going to do it.
8634000	8637000	And I don't think any of us trust the government to do it right.
8638000	8641000	Those crotchy old people, I don't think so.
8641000	8642000	Yeah. All right.
8642000	8646000	Again, best of luck. It sounds like you're going to have a very busy summer.
8646000	8650000	But I hope, above all else, I hope the baby has a wonderful first birthday.
8650000	8653000	Oh, thank you so much. That means a lot.
8653000	8654000	You're welcome.
8654000	8657000	Yeah. Hey, keep doing what you're doing and have fun.
8657000	8660000	All right. We'll try our best. Take care, my friend. It's always good to hear from you.
8660000	8662000	All right. See you later.
8662000	8663000	All right. See you.
8663000	8668000	All right. YYR with some world exclusives. I feel like E3's already begun.
8668000	8671000	I forgot to mention while he was on the phone.
8671000	8673000	Oh, no. Well, he might still be in chat.
8673000	8676000	I remember last week we were confused because he sent us an email about something,
8676000	8679000	about a dream game idea that he was going to implement.
8679000	8682000	And we were like, I don't remember what the hell that is.
8682000	8683000	Yeah.
8683000	8685000	I still don't know what the hell that is.
8685000	8687000	Yeah, I forgot to ask him on the phone.
8687000	8691000	I do recall something coming up about a Pixel Shits revision.
8691000	8692000	Oh, okay.
8692000	8694000	Of some sort, which he didn't address.
8694000	8699000	But you know what, I'm sure YYR has a whole list of dream projects he's got to do.
8699000	8703000	But I support these games getting a second life on Steam.
8703000	8707000	So I'm all for more people discovering Sharpshooter.
8707000	8712000	I mean, even myself, I kind of said like, the shooter on the 360 controller wasn't my favorite thing.
8712000	8714000	Like, I still want to support what YYR is doing.
8714000	8716000	But, you know, I prefer these other ones.
8716000	8721000	But like to be able to do this on Steam, I think with the mouse, I'm going to super be into this.
8721000	8722000	So I'm excited.
8722000	8725000	I'll definitely stream the game whenever YYR will let me.
8726000	8731000	So whether I get a sneak peek or if I have to wait for release like the rest of you, whatever happens.
8731000	8733000	We'll do a stream at some point.
8733000	8737000	Okay, well, anyhow, let's move on.
8737000	8739000	We have more news to get to.
8739000	8740000	Rapid fire news, actually.
8740000	8744000	Travel around the world and check out some quick news stories going on.
8744000	8745000	Who's starting us? Loki?
8745000	8747000	That would be me.
8747000	8750000	So Steam Link is finally coming to iOS.
8750000	8753000	So it's been available on Android devices for a while now.
8753000	8757000	And now it's available on iPhone, iPad, and Apple TV.
8757000	8763000	So you can actually stream your Steam library to those Apple devices.
8763000	8768000	There's a way to game more on other Apple devices.
8768000	8770000	So cool.
8770000	8771000	So go check that out.
8771000	8772000	It's free.
8772000	8774000	I still have yet to use mine.
8774000	8776000	And I even have a Steam Link.
8776000	8779000	But I haven't gotten a chance to use it.
8779000	8781000	So, oh well.
8781000	8782000	Someday.
8782000	8783000	Someday I'll use it.
8783000	8790000	And then finally, I guess we got some more news about the Mortal Kombat reboot.
8790000	8791000	The movie, that is.
8791000	8796000	So it was announced a while ago that it was going to be rebooted.
8796000	8805000	And apparently there is some more, I guess, social media tweets and stuff about it.
8805000	8809000	So I guess we're going to be seeing it sometime soon.
8809000	8816000	Basically that, you know, I guess it's coming from Greg Russo.
8816000	8821000	He says, if anyone has any concerns, if our director, Simon McQuid, will stay faithful to Mortal Kombat,
8821000	8826000	I urge you to go back and look at some of the video game commercials he directed.
8826000	8831000	His PS3 Michael spot still gets me every time I watch it.
8831000	8835000	And that was the one, I remember that commercial.
8835000	8839000	That was the one for the PlayStation where they're all kind of like, you know, this is for Michael.
8839000	8840000	It's all the PlayStation characters and stuff.
8840000	8842000	Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. I remember that.
8842000	8844000	Oh yeah, that was a pretty...
8844000	8848000	Basically letting you know that, hey, you know, he is a big fan of video games.
8848000	8855000	So, I mean, that's better than, hey, let's take Sonic the Hedgehog and make that into a movie.
8855000	8857000	Because Smurfs did good.
8857000	8858000	All right.
8858000	8859000	And Chipmunks did good.
8859000	8860000	Moving on.
8860000	8863000	Speaking of movies and things that became video games, how about Ghostbusters?
8863000	8866000	You know, there was a Ghostbusters video game in 2009.
8866000	8869000	It was terrible and it was a reskin of another Japanese game.
8869000	8872000	I was partial to Ghostbusters from like the 80s.
8872000	8873000	The 2009 one?
8873000	8876000	No, not 2009, sorry. I'm talking about like the old arcade one.
8876000	8877000	Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
8877000	8878000	Oh, the arcade one.
8878000	8881000	Yeah, I'm sorry. The one in 2009 was good. I was just thinking of the old one.
8881000	8883000	Yeah, the 2009 one's basically Ghostbusters 3.
8883000	8887000	Because it was all the original cast lending their voice and stuff.
8887000	8892000	Yeah, and I'm thinking of the classic Activision game from the 80s.
8892000	8895000	So I think what you're thinking of was arcade.
8895000	8898000	Yeah, it was an arcade game and it was a reskin of a different game.
8898000	8900000	Got it. Okay, that's not what this is.
8900000	8904000	But anyway, that game, the Ghostbusters 3, that game,
8904000	8907000	you know, you haven't been able to buy that on Steam since 2017.
8907000	8909000	And people just kind of assumed, oh, licensing ran out.
8909000	8911000	Something happened there with that movie.
8911000	8913000	Maybe because of the new movie.
8913000	8914000	Never just thought about it.
8914000	8917000	I know. I didn't really give it a lot of thought either because the game was kind of old, right?
8917000	8921000	Apparently, the Taiwanese game software rating website
8921000	8925000	has shown that this game might be getting a remaster because there's a new listing up.
8925000	8928000	Ghostbusters, the video game remastered.
8928000	8932000	Mad Dog Games is the publisher who did things like World War Z and NBA playgrounds.
8932000	8938000	Obviously, there's no release date, but this does show that this is being planned anyway for Xbox One.
8938000	8943000	So it would probably be safe to assume that most of the, especially considering the age of the game,
8943000	8947000	probably most, at least PlayStation 4, Xbox One, probably PC are going to be your big platforms.
8947000	8951000	Switch, maybe, maybe not, just depending on how intense the remaster is.
8951000	8956000	Can't imagine it's at the level where you won't even run on the Switch.
8956000	8957000	So be curious to see, though.
8957000	8961000	We'll wait for something official, but that'll be great for fans of Ghostbusters.
8963000	8968000	Also, we mentioned earlier in the show that Team Sonic Racing is coming out this week.
8968000	8971000	I guess I was the only one here in studio kind of interested in that one.
8971000	8972000	I mean, it looks okay.
8972000	8974000	I wasn't as excited as the first.
8974000	8977000	I think a lot of the stuff that came out later on, the DLC, was kind of exciting.
8977000	8982000	Like, you know, like the whole Shenmue and driving the Outrun arcade.
8982000	8985000	I get it. Like, you know, all the characters and the other one kind of made it.
8985000	8988000	They should have Mario as a DLC character.
8988000	8990000	Well, guess what? There's going to be no DLC.
8990000	8991000	That's the big news.
8991000	8992000	Oh, lame.
8992000	8993000	There's no DLC for Team Sonic Racing.
8993000	8998000	And yeah, so they say that they could take content and sell it as DLC.
8998000	9001000	This is Sega's Aaron Weber in a statement saying,
9001000	9006000	this is just all the content that's going to be in the game is right there at launch.
9006000	9009000	We're not going to charge you three bucks later for characters that were cut out of the game.
9009000	9012000	It's all there, and you'll unlock everything as you go through.
9012000	9013000	So there it is.
9013000	9016000	This is no DLC because everything they want to do is just going to be up front.
9016000	9018000	Kind of hard to complain about that.
9018000	9019000	How games were.
9019000	9020000	Yeah, I know.
9020000	9021000	That's how the games used to be, right?
9021000	9022000	Yep.
9022000	9024000	Anyway, let's move on to Dark Sakura.
9024000	9025000	Whale.
9025000	9027000	You know, there's two things that I like.
9027000	9029000	Soulcalibur and cats.
9029000	9030000	What do they have in common?
9030000	9033000	You can fight a game with a cat on your head now.
9033000	9039000	Basically, there is a bunch of cosmetic DLC that has been put out for Soulcalibur 6.
9039000	9044000	And you get a bunch of pretty clothes and tuxedoses and stuff.
9044000	9045000	And cats.
9045000	9047000	Cat hats.
9047000	9049000	That's all cat hats.
9049000	9051000	Not the cat in the hat, but the cat is a hat.
9051000	9052000	And on your shoulder.
9052000	9054000	So cat shoulder pauldrons or whatever.
9054000	9064000	And on top of that, it's 150 different customization items and 97 music tracks from the previous series.
9064000	9066000	But, number one, cats.
9066000	9068000	Really, it's all cats.
9068000	9076000	And number two, speaking of some Bandai Namco stuff.
9076000	9083000	Harada Katsuhiro, who is the tech and producer, is now general manager at Bandai Namco.
9083000	9086000	So that puts him in charge.
9086000	9090000	Of course, still Tekken, but Ace Combat, Soulcalibur, Dark Souls, a bunch of others.
9090000	9092000	Some of their sports titles.
9092000	9093000	So, yeah.
9093000	9095000	No vacay for him, huh?
9095000	9102000	And then, as far as Tekken, Michael Murray will be helming the series going forward.
9102000	9105000	He was with the franchise for Tekken 4.
9105000	9108000	And now he's going to be producing the future sequels.
9108000	9109000	Zzzz.
9109000	9110000	Stago.
9110000	9111000	All right.
9111000	9114000	You know, I thought I heard kind of a similar note.
9114000	9118000	I thought I kind of heard like an update on Tekken Cross Street Fighter.
9118000	9121000	And the update is basically, we're not sure it can happen.
9121000	9123000	And it was kind of a downer.
9123000	9124000	Too late.
9124000	9126000	The word is whatever.
9126000	9127000	Yeah.
9127000	9129000	I would have still liked it, but whatever.
9129000	9132000	You got Akuma and Tekken 7.
9132000	9133000	Take it or leave it.
9133000	9134000	Be happy with what you get.
9134000	9135000	That's right.
9135000	9136000	All right.
9136000	9139000	Let's move on and travel around the world and check out some release dates.
9139000	9141000	Two weeks of release dates now.
9141000	9144000	Well, we read them last week when you weren't here, just so you know.
9144000	9145000	What?
9145000	9146000	Yeah.
9146000	9147000	When you weren't here.
9147000	9148000	But I mean, no, no.
9148000	9150000	I mean this week and next week.
9150000	9151000	Oh, hello.
9151000	9152000	Right.
9152000	9153000	Because we're not here next week.
9153000	9154000	Yes.
9154000	9155000	I mean, I understood what you were saying.
9155000	9156000	No, I'm okay.
9156000	9157000	I'm a little slow.
9157000	9158000	You don't have to call it out.
9158000	9160000	What'd you get for all those Oreos, Rob?
9160000	9164000	Don't be calling out to all the listeners and everybody what I'm doing during the break
9164000	9165000	on the show.
9165000	9166000	I wasn't talking about the break.
9166000	9168000	I'm talking about all the Oreos.
9168000	9169000	All of them.
9169000	9170000	All of them.
9170000	9171000	All right.
9171000	9172000	Anyway.
9172000	9174000	I'm actually going to be stopping for mint Oreos on the way home.
9174000	9175000	Let's check out some release dates.
9175000	9176000	I guess.
9176000	9177000	Sure.
9177000	9178000	For the next two weeks, if you want.
9178000	9179000	Sure.
9179000	9180000	Let's do it.
9180000	9181000	Make sure we know what's what week.
9181000	9187000	So for this coming week, we've got Assassin's Creed 3 remastered on Nintendo Switch.
9187000	9190000	Atelier Leluna, the Scion of Arland.
9190000	9194000	That's going to be on PC, Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4.
9194000	9198000	Dauntless on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
9198000	9201000	Observation on PC and PlayStation 4.
9201000	9205000	Resident Evil 4, Resident Evil, Resident Evil 0.
9205000	9206000	All on Nintendo Switch.
9206000	9213000	Team Sonic Racing on PC, the Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
9213000	9217000	Total War, Three Kingdoms on PC.
9217000	9222000	And then the following week, we have Little Friends, Dogs and Cats on Nintendo Switch.
9222000	9225000	That's as close as you're going to get to Nintendogs on the Switch.
9225000	9226000	So there you go.
9226000	9232000	Among the Sleep Enhanced Edition on the Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
9232000	9235000	Blood and Truth on PlayStation 4.
9235000	9238000	Oxygen Not Included on PC, Mac and Linux.
9238000	9240000	That one looked interesting.
9240000	9242000	I thought I saw a trailer for that one.
9242000	9245000	It reminded me of like Portal almost.
9245000	9251000	And then Cricket 19 on the Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
9251000	9257000	And Pixarc on PC, Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
9257000	9259000	That gets us into June.
9259000	9261000	So stay tuned for June.
9261000	9262000	Stay tuned for June.
9262000	9266000	Meanwhile, we'll travel to Japan and check out some of the releases coming out there.
9266000	9271000	On May 23rd, Assassin's Creed 3 Remastered is out on the PlayStation 4.
9271000	9274000	Also a new headset if you're into peripherals.
9274000	9276000	An official headset there on May 23rd.
9276000	9278000	Otherwise, it's a pretty quiet week on the 23rd.
9278000	9281000	As we move into May 30th, we have a couple other new games.
9281000	9285000	Blood and Truth as well as that VA11 Hall A.
9285000	9288000	That Valhalla, that kind of like hacker game.
9288000	9293000	It actually gets a physical release in Japan as well on the 30th of May.
9293000	9294000	So that's pretty cool.
9294000	9296000	And that again is with a game called Blood and Truth.
9296000	9299000	And that's pretty much what your May looks like on the PlayStation 4 in Japan.
9299000	9302000	I'm trying to peek ahead here at the Nintendo Switch.
9302000	9304000	Nintendo Switch has some other stuff.
9304000	9306000	A lot of, again, peripherals.
9306000	9309000	But that Assassin's Creed 3 remaster is also on the Switch.
9309000	9311000	As is Biohazard Origins Collection.
9311000	9313000	Of course, that's Resident Evil in Japan.
9313000	9318000	And then a game called Shiritsu Berubara Gakuen comes out on...
9318000	9319000	What?
9320000	9321000	Is that a big game?
9321000	9322000	Shiri... Shiri...
9322000	9324000	Well, you remember the other ones?
9324000	9326000	There's Shiritsu Justice Gakuen.
9326000	9328000	Shiri... Is it Arrival Schools?
9329000	9331000	It doesn't look like Arrival Schools.
9331000	9332000	It looks like a school-based game.
9332000	9334000	But it looks like, again, like a story.
9334000	9337000	It's like the moment that you said that I instantly thought of Arrival Schools because it was...
9337000	9339000	No. And it's not Capcom anyway. It's Idea Factory.
9339000	9340000	Okay. Well, whatever.
9340000	9341000	That should be enough right there.
9341000	9342000	Sorry to get you excited.
9342000	9343000	Don't care.
9345000	9348000	And then let me peek ahead at the 30th on the Switch.
9348000	9352000	A game called To All of Mankind is out on the Switch that week.
9352000	9359000	As well as, again, that VA11 Hall A Valhalla is also out on the Switch in Japan that week.
9359000	9361000	And that is pretty much your releases for Japan.
9361000	9363000	So how about the UK, Dark Sakura?
9363000	9364000	We have some.
9364000	9372000	We have, on the 20th, we've got Killing Floor Double Feature, Team Sonic Racing, Assassin's Creed 3 Remastered.
9372000	9375000	On the 21st, everybody's Golf VR.
9375000	9383000	22nd, Total War Three Kingdoms Limited Edition, TT Isle of Man, Ride on the Edge.
9383000	9391000	On the 23rd, Atelier Lula, The Scion of Arland, Dollhouse for the King.
9391000	9394000	On the 27th, Cricket 19.
9394000	9398000	Also on the 27th, Little Friends, Dogs and Cats.
9400000	9404000	Spellforce 3, Soul Harvest Limited Edition.
9404000	9409000	On the 28th, we have Among the Sleep Enhanced Edition, Blood and Truth.
9409000	9415000	And on the 30th, we have Fun Fun Animal Park and Home Sweet Home.
9415000	9419000	And Koutodama, The Seven Mysteries of Fujisawa.
9419000	9424000	And Trover Saves the Universe and Pixar. That's it.
9425000	9430000	Alright. Well, we'll be back in two weeks with more release dates.
9430000	9435000	And I imagine as summer E3 comes up, we're probably going to have some surprise summer releases.
9435000	9436000	So that'll be fun.
9436000	9440000	We always know E3 is a good time for the whole, and it's out today, sorts of news.
9440000	9442000	So, now let's go to our mailbag.
9442000	9446000	Every week you guys send us emails to participate at orangelauntrader.com.
9447000	9449000	And we read some of our favorites on the air.
9449000	9451000	I think we have a couple emails tonight.
9451000	9452000	We have three.
9452000	9457000	So we didn't need YYR to save us from a Drag Race chat, but I'm glad YYR called in nonetheless.
9457000	9460000	Well, I do still want FUs later, but...
9460000	9463000	So, first one comes from Robert M.
9463000	9467000	Rob, on the variety of Pokemon in Detective Pikachu, a lot of Pokemon got cut.
9467000	9468000	This was a quote from you.
9468000	9472000	Me to myself, how many of that HM do they have anyway?
9472000	9474000	I get the joke.
9474000	9476000	It gets cut as a move.
9476000	9477000	Forget it.
9477000	9481000	I haven't been able to find the Labo VR expansion kits yet, even on Amazon.
9481000	9488000	Any idea if this is a Nintendo Shop at Home exclusive, or I'll be able to find them retail sooner rather than later?
9488000	9489000	Labo what?
9489000	9490000	Labo VR?
9490000	9491000	Yeah, I haven't seen them in stores anywhere.
9491000	9493000	They've been sold out.
9493000	9497000	So this is just an LOL Nintendo and peripherals never stay in stock.
9497000	9499000	It's kind of boring though.
9499000	9503000	Like, I have them built in my house and we haven't touched them at all.
9503000	9510000	The robot kit that was marked down to $39 this weekend, but I gotta be honest, I built it, I played it for a little bit.
9510000	9512000	I'm probably not going to touch it again.
9512000	9514000	And I heard the VR Zelda thing was not good.
9514000	9516000	It's... no.
9516000	9519000	And the VR Mario thing is kind of...
9519000	9523000	I'm not going to... to be honest, I had fun building them.
9523000	9525000	I'm not going to buy anymore.
9525000	9530000	Because it's a bunch... like I thought it was going to be, it's a bunch of garbage that I built.
9530000	9532000	But what about the Nintendo Labo Bacon Griller?
9533000	9536000	Until it can grill bacon, I...
9536000	9540000	Listen, I have a bunch of bacon in my fridge.
9540000	9542000	It ain't grilling any of it.
9542000	9545000	So, you know, that's unfortunately of no use to me.
9545000	9547000	That's my worry.
9547000	9550000	It's just that it's going to be a thing that you build and takes up a ton of space.
9550000	9555000	And yeah, I know there's extra pieces that they're like, look, she doesn't take up that much space.
9555000	9557000	But it still takes up a lot of space.
9557000	9559000	And I have no place to put this stuff.
9559000	9561000	And right now it's just sitting on my kitchen table.
9561000	9563000	Among the pile of other stuff.
9563000	9565000	So...
9565000	9567000	Yeah, my kids aren't interested in playing it.
9567000	9569000	I thought that they would be all gung ho.
9569000	9571000	Oh, let's play the VR games.
9571000	9573000	No, they really moved on to just...
9573000	9575000	Anything else.
9575000	9577000	Alright.
9579000	9581000	So next meal.
9581000	9582000	Yes.
9582000	9583000	Alright.
9583000	9585000	Hey, O-L-R, Frodo Swagins here.
9585000	9587000	I remember a few months back, Rob and Bob,
9587000	9590000	were messing around with one of the updates on No Man's Sky.
9590000	9593000	I was wondering if you've heard anything about
9593000	9596000	the Beyond update that is supposed to release this...
9596000	9597000	Grammar.
9597000	9599000	Supposed to release this summer.
9599000	9602000	I guess it's a massive three-part update.
9602000	9605000	I just read on the website that they will announce No Man's Sky Online.
9605000	9607000	The paragraph stated the following, quote,
9607000	9611000	No Man's Sky Online includes a radical new social multiplayer experience
9611000	9614000	which empowers players everywhere in the universe
9614000	9616000	to meet and play together.
9616000	9619000	Whilst this brings people together like never before,
9619000	9622000	it has many recognizable online elements,
9622000	9625000	we don't consider No Man's Sky to be an MMO.
9625000	9627000	It won't require a subscription,
9627000	9629000	won't contain microtransactions,
9629000	9630000	wince, wince, wince,
9630000	9633000	and will be free for all existing players, end quote.
9633000	9635000	I've never given this game a chance
9635000	9639000	because there just didn't seem to be enough there for me
9639000	9641000	to want to invest any time in.
9641000	9644000	But I'm wondering if this update may potentially get me into the game.
9644000	9645000	Any thoughts?
9645000	9647000	You know, that game really has,
9647000	9649000	and I don't know anything that you don't already know.
9649000	9651000	I mean, we just know kind of what's out there officially.
9651000	9654000	I don't know if we'll get more insight at E3 or what.
9654000	9656000	Probably not, because I guess, you know,
9656000	9658000	I don't think there'll be a lot of focus on the game,
9658000	9660000	but it sure is really neat how much support,
9660000	9662000	especially when you consider, like,
9662000	9665000	how much the internet really shat on that game when it came out
9665000	9668000	because, you know, they felt that the creators
9668000	9671000	and Sony and its marketing had over-promised and under-delivered,
9671000	9673000	which, you know, at this point is neither here nor there
9673000	9676000	because they've really, you know, hit the pavement hard
9676000	9678000	over the past, you know, couple of years
9678000	9681000	and tried to make that game more into what that original vision is.
9681000	9684000	So I think the fact that they are continuing to support it
9684000	9686000	in the way that they are,
9686000	9689000	and they are creating these free updates and things of that nature,
9689000	9691000	I think it's a goddamn miracle, quite honestly,
9691000	9695000	because EA would have pulled the online services by now.
9695000	9696000	Let's be real.
9696000	9699000	So I think it's really cool,
9699000	9702000	and I think, yeah, I think if you've been looking at the website,
9702000	9704000	you've been watching the live streams that Bobby and I were doing
9704000	9705000	in the past and stuff, and you think,
9705000	9708000	hey, there's something here that interests me, go for it,
9708000	9710000	especially if you get on a sale or something like that.
9710000	9712000	I don't think it's in the Epic Store,
9712000	9713000	so you're not going to get a sale there,
9713000	9716000	but, you know, the game has been out for a little while.
9716000	9719000	I imagine when these expansions first come out,
9719000	9721000	the game's going to go back to full price,
9721000	9723000	and that's going to be a big deal.
9724000	9727000	And that's kind of what's happened before with these big updates.
9727000	9729000	They charge full price for the game again
9729000	9731000	because they know people want to buy it again to check it out.
9731000	9735000	So if you see a sale kind of before that happens,
9735000	9738000	I would say it's a really good time to pick up the game,
9738000	9741000	but at the same time, what's wrong with paying full price
9741000	9744000	because the developers have shown that they are very committed to this game
9744000	9747000	when I think a lot of other people in this industry
9747000	9749000	would have walked away from it a long time ago.
9749000	9751000	So I think that part is commendable.
9752000	9753000	Next email?
9753000	9754000	Yes, please.
9754000	9755000	All right.
9755000	9757000	Hi, all. It's the one and only Metal Mayhem,
9757000	9759000	or Raginator, if you'd prefer.
9759000	9762000	I thought I'd write in this week with a nostalgia-filled email.
9762000	9765000	By the way, it's not a novel, so this is great.
9765000	9769000	So as we know, Raginator has been prone to...
9769000	9770000	Novels.
9770000	9771000	Novels, yes.
9771000	9772000	Now it's just a novel question.
9772000	9774000	Now it's a novella.
9774000	9776000	So let's hop in the way back.
9776000	9778000	Okay, first of all, you wrote way back,
9778000	9781000	which is okay, but in Rocky and Bullinkle,
9781000	9784000	it's an acronym, W-A-B-A-C, way back.
9784000	9786000	Just saying.
9786000	9788000	So let's hop in the way back machine
9788000	9790000	and travel to the days of yore before the days of YouTube,
9790000	9792000	Twitch, and their ilk,
9792000	9794000	back to the days where if you wanted to find out about a game,
9794000	9797000	you had to read magazines, look at kiosks, stores,
9797000	9799000	borrow from a friend or rent them,
9799000	9801000	and see commercials on TV,
9801000	9804000	meaning the 1980s through virtually all of the 90s.
9804000	9807000	Growing up in this era as a kid and teen, for me,
9807000	9810000	game commercials flooded the airwaves,
9810000	9812000	and a lot of these commercials I found to be quite memorable,
9812000	9815000	or sold me on specific games and or systems.
9815000	9818000	It's hard to forget commercials for games like Super Mario 3,
9818000	9821000	people chanting Mario and zooming out to see Mario's face.
9821000	9823000	There's the Dr. Mario commercial,
9823000	9826000	Donkey Kong Country, Final Fantasy VII,
9826000	9828000	multiple versions of that commercial.
9828000	9830000	My favorite is the reset button one.
9830000	9832000	The Sega yell commercials.
9832000	9833000	Sega!
9833000	9835000	Mortal Kombat, et cetera.
9835000	9837000	Too many to list without droning on.
9837000	9839000	A lot of these I remember fondly,
9839000	9841000	and have sold me on a game or system.
9841000	9843000	All this being said, I pose this question.
9843000	9848000	Are there any old school commercials from the 1980s or 1990s
9848000	9850000	that were memorable for you,
9850000	9852000	or sold you on a game or systems?
9852000	9854000	Bonus points will be awarded if Loki says
9854000	9857000	the Space Weasel landed on Uranus, just K-L-O-L.
9857000	9859000	By the way, this is a very well-written email.
9859000	9862000	Besides that crazy last sentence, but okay.
9862000	9863000	Okay.
9863000	9864000	What about Space Weasel?
9864000	9865000	It landed on Uranus.
9865000	9866000	It must have been a commercial that I missed.
9866000	9867000	I don't know.
9867000	9868000	Or he's trying to get you to say something to clip it.
9868000	9869000	I don't know.
9869000	9870000	All right.
9870000	9874000	I remember the old Zelda commercial,
9874000	9877000	which didn't sell me on the game, but it was terrible.
9877000	9878000	Is that the one where they...
9878000	9879000	Because I was going to actually name that one.
9879000	9880000	Weevils!
9880000	9881000	Yeah, they've got Tektites.
9881000	9882000	Leavers!
9882000	9884000	They're naming all the enemies in the game.
9884000	9886000	And it has nothing to do with the game.
9886000	9889000	And nobody remembers the actual names.
9889000	9891000	I mean, you might remember like an Octorok and stuff,
9891000	9893000	but you don't really remember the names.
9893000	9897000	You only remember the Octorok because of either the cartoon or the CDI.
9897000	9898000	Or that bad commercial.
9898000	9899000	Yes.
9899000	9900000	Yeah, one of those.
9900000	9903000	You know which one, though, kind of actually got me interested in the game?
9903000	9906000	And then when I found out that my papa had it, I was really excited.
9906000	9908000	It was the commercial for Abadox.
9908000	9910000	It had like this slime come out of the machine.
9910000	9913000	And you know me, I'm grossed out by that type of stuff anyway.
9913000	9916000	But it says, the world's most disgusting game or something like that.
9916000	9919000	And I was like, I kind of won't play that.
9919000	9922000	And then my papa had Abadox and I super liked it,
9922000	9926000	but I always associated the commercial with being excited to play Abadox.
9926000	9929000	Which I had has a classic soundtrack.
9929000	9933000	This is a little bit tangenty and not the original question, but too bad.
9933000	9936000	Do you remember how much like box art would sell the game to?
9936000	9939000	And do you remember a game called Falanix on the Super Nintendo?
9939000	9940000	It was like...
9940000	9941000	Phalanx.
9941000	9942000	Phalanx, that's it.
9942000	9944000	And it was, you know, we didn't know how to pronounce the games.
9944000	9946000	So, and it was like the box art, and you got to look this up.
9946000	9948000	It was like some old dude playing a banjo,
9948000	9951000	sitting there while there's like a star going off the side.
9951000	9952000	A star going off in the sky.
9952000	9953000	It was like a shoot-em-up game.
9953000	9956000	And the box art had nothing to do with the game.
9956000	9958000	But it was one of those things where it's like, this is so fucking random.
9958000	9960000	I remember renting games.
9960000	9963000	It's like, what is this old dude with a banjo game?
9963000	9964000	I have to try that.
9964000	9967000	Because back in the day before there was Twitch,
9967000	9969000	I rented a lot of games to test them out.
9969000	9973000	And the thing is, is that the Japanese box art
9973000	9977000	totally had to do with, you know, what the game fucking is.
9977000	9978000	They thought that by putting...
9978000	9981000	And like there was an interview or something with the dude
9981000	9983000	that designed it or whatever.
9983000	9986000	And he was, although the thing I thought was funny about the Japanese one
9986000	9988000	is it looks like a giant space dildo.
9988000	9994000	But it was done to get that what the fuck factor
9994000	9995000	and get people interested in the game
9995000	9997000	because they would be talking about the box.
9997000	10002000	I am going to link the box art in the chat.
10002000	10005000	So Jamie, I know you're doing classic soundtrack this year
10005000	10007000	and then you're going to do 16-bit soundtracks next year.
10007000	10011000	So in 2021, I think you should do classic box art of the month.
10011000	10012000	I could do that.
10012000	10013000	Okay.
10013000	10015000	Are we going to put that in the Wiki?
10015000	10020000	Coming in 2021, classic box art of the month.
10020000	10024000	But what I love is that the chatters, of course, already found that.
10024000	10026000	And we're putting that up there.
10026000	10031000	Doesn't it look like a giant green dildo with balls?
10031000	10032000	Anyway.
10032000	10034000	Okay, back to the original question.
10034000	10036000	I'm sorry, I did a tangent, but you know what?
10036000	10037000	It was worth it.
10037000	10039000	So commercials.
10039000	10042000	I don't remember the video game commercials as much as I remember.
10042000	10045000	Okay, you know the commercial from the 80s for like video game related things
10045000	10047000	that really sticks out in my mind?
10047000	10048000	Nintendo.
10048000	10050000	It's for breakfast now.
10050000	10051000	Nintendo.
10051000	10053000	That's the one I remember.
10053000	10057000	Outside of everything else, I remember that goddamn Nintendo serial commercial.
10057000	10060000	And then I also remember shows like Starrcade and Nick Arcade
10060000	10063000	because those are just fucking commercials for video games.
10063000	10064000	Right?
10064000	10069000	Well, actually it was watching Starrcade that made me super want a Neo Geo.
10069000	10070000	Oh, yeah.
10070000	10074000	And then I was like, oh, I'm never going to get a Neo Geo
10074000	10077000	because number one, Alabama, you weren't going to find a Neo Geo.
10077000	10079000	And then when I did find one place that had a Neo Geo,
10079000	10084000	it was like 800 bucks in the early 90s.
10084000	10085000	And then guess what happened?
10085000	10088000	I moved out here and guess what Dan had?
10088000	10090000	A fucking Neo Geo.
10090000	10092000	Look, Neo Geo.
10092000	10093000	Did you marry for a Neo Geo?
10093000	10096000	I did marry him for a Neo Geo.
10096000	10098000	You know how he got it, right?
10098000	10100000	He traded a Sega CD for it.
10100000	10101000	Oh, wow.
10101000	10102000	Yep.
10102000	10103000	And guess what we have now?
10103000	10106000	A bunch of Sega CDs and a CDX.
10106000	10107000	Time does a lot.
10107000	10114000	Loki, do you remember any commercials, gaming commercials as a kid growing up?
10114000	10116000	No, I don't.
10116000	10118000	I don't remember any, unfortunately.
10118000	10119000	All right.
10119000	10120000	Fair enough.
10120000	10121000	I remember.
10121000	10124000	Was it Mario 3 where everybody was standing out in the street streaming Mario, Mario?
10124000	10126000	That was the one he mentioned in the game.
10126000	10127000	Okay, so it was.
10127000	10128000	I do remember that one, too.
10128000	10130000	About the panning out and it being Mario's face.
10130000	10131000	Yeah, see, you named all the good ones.
10131000	10133000	But the ones that really, and I'll put it this way,
10133000	10138000	the ones that made me actually want to play a game were ones that showed game play.
10138000	10141000	And, you know, and I'll be honest,
10141000	10144000	I had already kind of gotten out of my watching TV phase
10144000	10149000	probably in like my early college years to like 96, 97.
10149000	10151000	I wasn't really watching a lot of TV, except for.
10151000	10153000	I was raised on Nickelodeon.
10153000	10159000	Except for Saturday Night Live and 120 Minutes and Headbangers Ball.
10159000	10160000	That was like my.
10160000	10161000	I mean, I would watch some stuff.
10161000	10163000	I still watch cartoons, you know, and I was watching my anime,
10163000	10167000	but I wasn't really watching a lot of like packaged TV.
10167000	10169000	So I missed a lot of commercials in the late 90s.
10169000	10172000	You know, you know who were celebrities to me growing up
10172000	10174000	or those kids on You Can't Do That on television.
10174000	10175000	That's how much Nickelodeon I watched.
10175000	10177000	You and your Alanis.
10177000	10178000	No, it's not even that.
10178000	10181000	Like that in some ways, that connection is just very random
10181000	10183000	because she was only on like two episodes of the show.
10183000	10184000	That's the part they don't tell you.
10184000	10186000	She wasn't like she wasn't like Lisa Ruddy or something.
10186000	10188000	She was only on two episodes of show.
10188000	10192000	But anyway, yeah, like I those were like celebrities that
10192000	10195000	and the cast of Clue, the movie were like celebrities to me.
10195000	10198000	So I've always I love they were celebrities anyway.
10198000	10201000	I love Tim Curry long before the Rocky Horror Picture Show,
10201000	10202000	believe it or not.
10202000	10205000	Well, well, yeah, because I mean, there was Annie.
10205000	10206000	I love that movie.
10206000	10207000	Worst Witch.
10207000	10208000	Right.
10208000	10209000	I didn't really see the Worst Witch.
10209000	10210000	Labyrinth.
10210000	10211000	Not Labyrinth.
10211000	10212000	Legend.
10212000	10213000	Legend.
10213000	10214000	Which I still can't watch all the way through.
10214000	10216000	I don't think I watched Legend growing up.
10216000	10217000	I don't remember watching it until way later.
10217000	10219000	He played the devil and it was beautiful.
10219000	10220000	I've seen it now.
10220000	10225000	But yeah, but it it, you know.
10225000	10228000	I don't funny enough, even though I do all the white face
10228000	10231000	and drag makeup, I am still scared of clowns.
10231000	10232000	Sure.
10232000	10233000	True story.
10234000	10238000	But like like I somewhat I actually saw someone walking
10238000	10239000	out of Party City.
10239000	10244000	Yes, I went to Party City to build the one by my
10244000	10245000	I'll just say Delta Shores.
10245000	10246000	Yeah, it's closing.
10246000	10248000	That's that's I just I went there and that's where I got
10248000	10250000	because I was hosting a masquerade burlesque thing
10250000	10252000	and I got a purple mask like 50 cents.
10252000	10256000	I was going to get, though, a mug man mask to put on the wall
10256000	10257000	and it was damaged.
10257000	10258000	I messaged you about it.
10258000	10260000	I'm going to I'm going to put on what I got for $14
10260000	10261000	at Party City.
10261000	10262000	OK, well, while you're doing that,
10263000	10266000	you know, I I was going to say, you know,
10268000	10272000	that was the movie for me that made me fall in love
10272000	10273000	with Madeline Kahn.
10273000	10276000	And, you know, I already knew Leslie Ann Warren
10276000	10277000	from other movies.
10277000	10279000	I don't know what else she's done since then.
10280000	10281000	Mission Impossible.
10281000	10283000	OK, Rob says Mission Impossible.
10285000	10288000	But I mean, that was kind of the thing.
10288000	10289000	I mean.
10290000	10291000	I don't really, though.
10293000	10294000	I can't think of anything else.
10295000	10297000	What were other things that you remember?
10298000	10299000	Here's Rob's back.
10300000	10302000	I had a feeling you'd get the purple jacket.
10303000	10305000	Did you see this on the rack?
10305000	10306000	I was going to buy that.
10306000	10309000	I know I actually I almost I came really close
10309000	10311000	to buy one for one of the sisters who loves purple.
10312000	10314000	And there were two on the rack about the large one,
10314000	10315000	which still won't even button.
10315000	10316000	I don't know what that says.
10316000	10319000	But don't I look like the Grimace and the Hamburglar
10319000	10320000	had a baby?
10320000	10321000	Kind of.
10321000	10322000	Yeah. So there you go.
10323000	10325000	You're you're the gay agenda.
10326000	10328000	Rob's costume is the gay agenda.
10328000	10330000	I'm here to steal the gay agenda.
10330000	10332000	No. So, yeah, I bought this and I'm even wearing
10332000	10333000	a purple shirt right now.
10333000	10334000	So it works out. Yes.
10334000	10336000	So I bought this suit top for 14 bucks.
10336000	10337000	I'm sorry.
10337000	10338000	I bought a leotard.
10338000	10341000	But it's it's a hideous purple suit and I love it.
10341000	10342000	I bought a leotard.
10342000	10343000	You know what you should do?
10343000	10344000	What? Stone it.
10344000	10345000	Stone the jacket?
10345000	10346000	Stone the jacket.
10346000	10347000	Stone the lapels.
10348000	10349000	Oh, my God.
10349000	10350000	I love that idea.
10350000	10351000	Or like on the back.
10351000	10353000	I'll put something in purple rhinestones.
10353000	10354000	You know what I have?
10354000	10355000	What?
10355000	10356000	I have a black a black felt skull.
10356000	10357000	You know what I want?
10357000	10358000	A bedazzler.
10359000	10360000	Well, no, we take the dazzle.
10360000	10362000	The shit that has happened to this show.
10363000	10366000	We take that that black felt skull of mine.
10366000	10369000	Don't you think I take this show seriously?
10369000	10370000	No, no, no, no.
10370000	10371000	Listen to my idea.
10371000	10372000	It's great.
10372000	10374000	And we glitter gold glitter it.
10375000	10377000	And put that on the back of the jacket.
10377000	10382000	So I just want to point out if Metal Mayhem was sending in an email to completely derail
10382000	10384000	this show with his innocent question.
10384000	10385000	Congratulations.
10385000	10386000	You succeeded.
10388000	10389000	All right.
10391000	10392000	Let's move on.
10393000	10394000	You want to do another story for us?
10394000	10397000	Like, would you like do you want to talk about video games?
10397000	10398000	Yes, let's talk about video games.
10398000	10400000	We're not talking about video games.
10400000	10401000	All right.
10401000	10402000	It's low key.
10402000	10404000	Tell us about video games while I take this stuff off.
10404000	10405000	All right.
10405000	10409000	So Sega has announced some more games that are going to be coming to the Genesis mini
10409000	10415000	console pretty soon, including Mega Man, the Wily Wars, Street Fighter II special championship
10415000	10420000	or special champion edition and Ghouls and Ghosts.
10420000	10424000	Along with that, though, there's going to be some other additional games that were announced
10424000	10428000	as well from other people or other publishers other than Capcom.
10428000	10433000	So we have Alex Kidd in the Enchanted Castle, Beyond Oasis, Golden Axe, Fantasy Star 4,
10433000	10439000	The End of the Millennium, Sonic Spinball, Vector Man and Wonder Boy in Monster World.
10439000	10440000	Squeak.
10441000	10443000	So that's what we have announced so far.
10443000	10444000	30 games announced so far.
10444000	10446000	So I'm wondering, is there more?
10446000	10450000	And though now that they've announced all of their cap.
10450000	10454000	I don't know if it's all of the Capcom games, but they are mentioning Capcom games.
10454000	10457000	Sadly, it doesn't sound like there's any.
10457000	10458000	I don't.
10458000	10459000	Was the Lion King.
10459000	10463000	I think Aladdin was Capcom, though, wasn't it?
10463000	10464000	Or was that claim?
10464000	10469000	I think Capcom had a Disney license back then because they're the ones that did like DuckTales
10469000	10470000	on the NES.
10470000	10471000	I remember that.
10471000	10475000	But like, I don't remember if like a claim did like the Lion King and stuff like that.
10475000	10478000	Those are probably going to be trickier licenses to get anyway.
10478000	10480000	There's there's more IP involved with.
10480000	10482000	Yeah, for sure.
10482000	10484000	They have the Mickey Mouse game, though.
10484000	10486000	It says Aladdin on Super Nintendo was Capcom.
10486000	10488000	Genesis was Virgin.
10488000	10493000	So maybe maybe the different platforms had different license.
10493000	10495000	Well, they have Castle of Illusion, World of Illusion.
10495000	10499000	So, I mean, they've been having some talks with Disney.
10499000	10500000	There you go.
10500000	10501000	All right.
10501000	10503000	Well, moving on, I suppose.
10503000	10506000	Let's talk about some drama with Call of Duty.
10506000	10509000	There may be some changes going on for 2020.
10509000	10514000	Your reliable schedule of what Call of Duty games come out, which years may be changing a little bit.
10514000	10519000	Apparently, there are some insider sources claiming that Activision changed from the original plan.
10519000	10522000	So instead of Raven and Sledgehammer doing a single player game,
10522000	10526000	Treyarch is going to be doing Black Ops 5 in 2020.
10526000	10529000	It's going to be a Cold War set game is what they're saying.
10529000	10535000	Raven and Sledgehammer are going to be doing supporting studios adding a story to this title,
10535000	10537000	which is apparently pretty multiplayer heavy.
10537000	10540000	Yeah, that's what Black Ops 4 was and meh.
10540000	10542000	They're going to be saying it's cross-gen.
10542000	10546000	So they're saying it's going to be like PlayStation 5 as well as PlayStation 4.
10546000	10547000	Going to kind of do that.
10547000	10554000	And this year, at least in 2019, Modern Warfare is expected just that it's going to be a return to the Modern Warfare.
10554000	10560000	There may be a free-to-play part of that as well, like Fortnite, Apex Legends, the Battle Royale type of free-to-play.
10560000	10561000	We'll see.
10561000	10562000	We don't know.
10562000	10565000	I mean, again, they're all saying subject to change, right?
10565000	10568000	But what should be also noted, Eric, because everybody loves a little drama,
10568000	10571000	apparently the shakeup might be because of internal turmoil.
10571000	10575000	Raven and Sledgehammer are arguing frequently during the development of this game.
10575000	10576000	Yikes.
10576000	10578000	So we'll see, though.
10578000	10583000	I mean, E3 is just a few weeks away, and I'm sure they're going to announce at least this year's plan there,
10583000	10585000	even though we might have to wait a little longer until 2020.
10585000	10586000	Is Activision in it?
10586000	10589000	Oh, they always do something during like Xbox or PlayStation.
10589000	10593000	Yeah, they'll kind of team up with one of the, well, Sony's not there this year.
10593000	10596000	So if they're going to show anything, they're going to show it during Microsoft.
10596000	10597000	Yeah.
10597000	10598000	Or they'll do their own thing.
10598000	10599000	Yeah.
10599000	10605000	So I wonder if Sony's doing like a stream of some, you know, how they like do the like their inside.
10605000	10610000	You know, they haven't time and dated one, so either they're going to do it right before or maybe right after.
10610000	10613000	But I doubt that they wouldn't have any announcements that they're going to make.
10613000	10615000	I just think maybe they're not going to be there.
10615000	10622000	You would think that they want to be part of like the conversation and not just they're relying on third parties to make because Square Enix kind of took their spot.
10622000	10626000	So maybe Square Enix is going to be talking about PlayStation titles, you know, and that's what they're hoping.
10626000	10628000	Alrighty, we'll see.
10628000	10631000	Yeah, Bobby Blackwolf in chat says they'll do a state of play that week, I'm sure.
10631000	10635000	I don't know if it will be quite as timed at the same time as E3.
10635000	10642000	It might be later in the week once people kind of stop talking about the it would be smart, I think, for Sony to kind of do that if they're going to do it like later in the week.
10642000	10644000	But we'll see.
10644000	10649000	Anyway, SSJ100 Matt says Sony is probably under lock and key because of all the leaks in the past.
10649000	10650000	Who knows?
10650000	10654000	Anyway, Dark Soccer, let's go to a story I know you're excited about, right?
10654000	10660000	Yes, I think I giggled and then, you know, messaged Dan immediately about it.
10660000	10665000	And I'm going to read the translation from Famitsu directly.
10665000	10669000	So, anyway.
10669000	10680000	Sankatsu Sagi Nomori company is announcing today, that was March 19th, that they're starting to publish a game software for home consoles via their game department.
10680000	10681000	Beep!
10681000	10683000	I just think it's funny it's called Beep.
10683000	10688000	And their first release is the latest game on the Cotton series called Cotton Reboot.
10688000	10689000	Oh, I love Cotton!
10689000	10699000	It'll be released to Nintendo Switch, PS4, and Steam and is based on the brush up version of Cotton for the X68000, which is a pretty good copy version of Cotton.
10699000	10700000	I'm excited.
10700000	10702000	And I don't fucking care.
10702000	10705000	I'm going to do whatever it takes to get this goddamn game.
10705000	10707000	There's no lockout.
10707000	10708000	Yeah, there's no regional lock on Switch.
10708000	10709000	It's going to be mine.
10709000	10710000	Yeah.
10710000	10712000	I'm pretty familiar with Cotton for whatever reason.
10712000	10714000	It's like a shoot-em-up but with witches, right?
10714000	10718000	Yeah, and she's addicted to this candy called Willow, which apparently is really nasty and makes her throw up.
10718000	10722000	But she also enslaves fairies to fight for her.
10722000	10723000	Cool.
10723000	10729000	And I have, one of the best games I have on my Dreamcast is Panorama Cotton.
10729000	10730000	Not Panorama Cotton.
10730000	10733000	That was the Genesis one that they made 600 of.
10733000	10734000	Rainbow Cotton.
10734000	10738000	But this one is the side-scrolling classic Cotton.
10739000	10744000	That means I actually will be able to legit cosplay her now, like I've wanted to.
10744000	10745000	Alright.
10745000	10747000	Because she's adorbs.
10747000	10748000	Well, let's move on.
10748000	10751000	A couple more stories for you guys, then we're going to get to our listener roundtable.
10751000	10755000	But I am going to caution you guys, I'm not going to wait too long to see if anyone wants to call.
10755000	10759000	Because the show is running a little long, so I do want to wrap up.
10759000	10762000	In other words, the window is not going to be very big.
10762000	10765000	If you want to get in on the show, get in that green room ASAP.
10765000	10767000	Otherwise, we may just wrap up.
10767000	10771000	But for now, we've got a couple other stories, including some big stuff going on in the Minecraft world right now.
10771000	10778000	Yeah, so Minecraft had their 10-year celebration this week, so they were talking about different things.
10778000	10782000	So one of them is that they've sold 176 million copies worldwide.
10782000	10783000	That's a lot of copies.
10783000	10785000	That is a lot of copies.
10786000	10792000	There's also the original version of Minecraft that's free to play on web browsers now, if you wanted to.
10792000	10794000	Right, didn't that come up on last week's show?
10794000	10795000	Oh yeah, we did talk about that.
10795000	10799000	Because we knew they were going to announce something on the 17th, we just didn't know what that was yet.
10799000	10806000	Right, exactly. And that something is Minecraft Earth, which is like a Pokemon Go type of game.
10806000	10811000	It's basically an AR game where you can build in the real world, and it persists there.
10811000	10818000	So if you have the app, you can draw dicks literally everywhere, and they're just going to be there for you to run into.
10818000	10819000	World of dicks.
10819000	10822000	It's just dicks literally everywhere.
10822000	10824000	It's just going to be so amazing.
10824000	10825000	Dick's earth.
10825000	10828000	But apparently there's going to be some other stuff that you can do in the game.
10828000	10830000	They haven't really kind of explained what you can do.
10830000	10832000	So I could go to your house and build a dick on the roof.
10832000	10833000	Yes, you could.
10835000	10836000	That's awesome.
10836000	10842000	But you can also build stuff, I think, in actual Minecraft and export it out.
10842000	10847000	You are somehow going to gather resources also throughout the world.
10847000	10849000	So you'll be able to get blocks that way and stuff.
10849000	10851000	But I think it's awesome, I signed it for the beta.
10852000	10855000	You can do that. They have it on their website, you can sign up for it.
10855000	10857000	I think it's also worth noting.
10857000	10862000	I know a lot of the blogs and things and social media saying it's like Pokemon Go.
10862000	10866000	I think the only thing they have in common is their AR games.
10866000	10869000	But you're not collecting little Minecraft creatures.
10869000	10870000	It's nothing like that.
10870000	10878000	It's just basically the AR concept of what I do over here in my park drawing a giant, we'll say boobs now because we've done a lot of dick.
10878000	10884000	So if I draw boobs in my park, then you can come to my park and you're going to see these boobs that I drew.
10884000	10886000	Because you're going to see the world through your phone.
10886000	10887000	Yes.
10887000	10889000	Yes, booby world or whatever.
10889000	10891000	Yes, it'll be amazing.
10891000	10894000	There will be no harassment in this game whatsoever, I'm sure of it.
10894000	10898000	I'm just going to go around drawing vulvas for everybody.
10898000	10904000	Every school is going to be like, fuck this place with a big arrow pointing at it.
10904000	10913000	If you give humanity a giant blank canvas to write down all their thoughts and feelings, you're just asking for trouble.
10913000	10914000	You know what I mean?
10914000	10919000	Oh my god, can you imagine what people are going to build around the White House?
10919000	10920000	It's going to be glorious.
10920000	10925000	I'm very curious how this game is going to be moderated.
10925000	10927000	Will dicks be allowed, yes or no?
10927000	10929000	Walls of fire.
10929000	10930000	Alright.
10930000	10934000	Yes, Dark Tetsuya says, so time to penis or TTP for this Minecraft.
10934000	10935000	Oh, immediately.
10935000	10936000	Several nanoseconds.
10936000	10937000	Yeah, immediately.
10937000	10939000	They'll be, within the first week there'll be articles on Kotaku.
10939000	10940000	In beta.
10940000	10941000	In beta.
10941000	10943000	There will be like, because I'm sure there'll be a beta.
10943000	10954000	And hey, if I get in the Minecraft beta, the first thing I'm going to do, look, I swear here and now, the first thing I'm going to do when I get access to Minecraft Earth is I'm going to go draw a dick on Loki's roof.
10954000	10957000	That is going to be the first thing I'm going to do.
10957000	10964000	So sorry to give away where you live here on air, but just look for the giant dick because I'll have built it.
10964000	10966000	Alright.
10966000	10969000	Moving on, one more story for you guys tonight.
10969000	10973000	And it's a little bit timely because it is episode 777 after all.
10973000	10975000	So why not a story about gambling?
10975000	10976000	Yeah.
10976000	10980000	So Unity, the video game creation platform, right?
10980000	10986000	Not Unreal is kind of the other big one, but Unity is one of the big game writing and publishing platforms.
10986000	10990000	And Unity, they wrote kind of a controversial tweet, a blood post.
10990000	10991000	A blood post.
10991000	10992000	They wrote it in blood.
10992000	10993000	They pricked their finger.
10993000	10995000	What is wrong with my voice tonight?
10995000	11000000	A blog post talking about some of the features of the Unity engine.
11000000	11001000	You know, kind of like promotion things.
11001000	11005000	A lot of it was just like the typical things you would expect, you know, as far as promotion.
11005000	11010000	But what was also interesting was that it referenced upcoming features for gambling games.
11010000	11012000	Because, you know, a lot of like video...
11012000	11014000	Like, what does Konami do now?
11014000	11016000	It's not just pachinko jokes and stuff.
11016000	11020000	Like, go to any casino and look for the Konami logo.
11020000	11021000	It's everywhere.
11021000	11024000	So, yeah.
11024000	11027000	So anyway.
11027000	11032000	That is, yeah, that's a thing that Unity got kind of razzed for a little bit.
11033000	11035000	And they pulled their post and they wrote a little tweet saying,
11035000	11042000	based on your feedback today, we removed a tweet and blog post relating to some upcoming 2019.1 features
11042000	11045000	that are useful to creators of real money games.
11045000	11047000	You know, because they got called unethical.
11047000	11050000	You know, we had the addiction story earlier on, obviously.
11050000	11052000	You know, gambling addiction is a very real thing.
11052000	11056000	And video game, fakie gambling things kind of...
11056000	11059000	When I say fakie, I mean like online gaming.
11059000	11066000	Because, you know, on the dark web, if you will, you get a lot of ads for real money gambling sites and stuff.
11066000	11068000	Because that's something you can do in some places.
11068000	11072000	So, you know, maybe Unity doesn't want to embrace that so much.
11072000	11073000	I don't know.
11073000	11075000	But anyway.
11075000	11078000	Yeah, the original tweet, just so you know, said,
11078000	11084000	we recently delivered our first release of the year, Unity 2019.1, which includes about 300 features.
11084000	11088000	Many of which are especially helpful for developers in the gambling industry.
11088000	11089000	Well, woohoo.
11091000	11092000	Anyway.
11093000	11094000	There you go.
11094000	11096000	That's the Unity issue.
11096000	11100000	Do you think there's an issue with Unity supporting gambling games?
11100000	11101000	I mean, it's kind of one of the...
11101000	11102000	I don't know. Like, it's kind of...
11102000	11103000	We all know it's happening.
11103000	11105000	I mean, I understand where maybe it's not...
11105000	11106000	Just making it easier for...
11106000	11107000	I don't...
11107000	11108000	It's just a game engine.
11108000	11109000	Who cares?
11109000	11110000	Yeah.
11111000	11113000	You can do a lot in Unity.
11113000	11116000	You can make porn games in Unity.
11116000	11119000	But we don't talk about that, Loki.
11119000	11121000	But, I mean, you can do whatever you want in Unity.
11121000	11123000	It's a game engine, so it's...
11123000	11125000	Who makes the games is who you gotta...
11125000	11126000	I don't know.
11126000	11127000	I don't think...
11127000	11130000	I guess it's because they're making it easier that shame on them.
11130000	11131000	Yeah.
11131000	11132000	Alright.
11132000	11133000	Anyway.
11133000	11135000	Did you just make a Game of Thrones reference, by the way?
11135000	11136000	You did shame?
11136000	11137000	I hear you say shame.
11137000	11138000	No, shame on them.
11138000	11139000	Yeah.
11139000	11140000	It looks like you're ringing a bell.
11140000	11141000	No, I'm not.
11141000	11142000	Alright, anyway.
11142000	11144000	It's time for the Listener Round Table.
11144000	11149000	So if you wanna give us a call, you can via our Discord, if you wanna join our green room.
11149000	11153000	Or you can send us a question in the chat room, if you want to.
11153000	11154000	Get that in real quick.
11154000	11155000	Let me check, though, real quick on Loki.
11155000	11157000	See if there's any last minute stories.
11157000	11158000	I don't know if there was.
11158000	11159000	I think we kinda...
11159000	11160000	No.
11160000	11161000	We hit a lot.
11161000	11162000	I mean...
11162000	11165000	To be honest, I'm just very scared to even go out on the internet right now.
11165000	11166000	Oh, because, yeah, what have it.
11166000	11167000	Yeah, I understand.
11167000	11169000	So, I'm gonna say no.
11169000	11170000	Alright.
11170000	11171000	What do you plan to do on...
11171000	11173000	So, obviously, we know Dark Sakura is gonna be out of town.
11173000	11174000	I'm gonna be out of town.
11174000	11176000	What are you gonna do with your holiday weekend?
11176000	11178000	You thinking about doing some streaming?
11178000	11180000	I'm probably gonna try to stream on Sunday.
11180000	11181000	We'll see if I get around to it.
11181000	11182000	Unless, let's...
11182000	11183000	I'm gonna...
11183000	11190000	Listen, I'm not going with the kids, because I spend, like, all weekend with them.
11190000	11191000	I just don't want to.
11191000	11194000	Like, any time now, they're like, take us somewhere fun!
11194000	11197000	And, like, I had to spend a ton of money on them.
11197000	11199000	They're like, we only get $10 to spend in the arcade.
11199000	11202000	I'm like, dude, that's like 30 bucks for all of us to play arcade games.
11202000	11207000	And you guys are gonna blow it in, like, two minutes, because you're gonna play the stupid, you know, Flappy Bird.
11207000	11210000	Well, sometimes it's Flappy Bird if that arcade...
11210000	11216000	It's like a dollar a game for stupid crossy roads.
11216000	11221000	I'm like, you could play that for free at home, but we want the tickets to get garbage.
11221000	11224000	Like, it's $10 for that one tootsie roll that you got.
11224000	11225000	No thanks.
11225000	11226000	Alright.
11226000	11228000	Let me get to a question in our chat room, at least.
11228000	11232000	SG100Matt says, are you all interested in the Nintendo Game Pass deal?
11232000	11234000	Do you think you'll pick up on that Nintendo Game Pass deal?
11234000	11235000	Probably not.
11235000	11236000	I will.
11236000	11237000	No, I don't think so.
11237000	11241000	I know I'm gonna buy Mario Maker 2, and there'll be something Nintendo...
11241000	11242000	If it's good for a year...
11242000	11246000	I want to look at the terms, but if it's good for a year, there's gonna be something I'm gonna want later.
11246000	11248000	I guess it depends on what they announce.
11248000	11249000	But that's...
11249000	11250000	I don't know.
11250000	11251000	We'll see.
11251000	11252000	Maybe.
11252000	11256000	Yeah, I guess we do have E3 to kind of see what is gonna come out this year.
11256000	11257000	And that's all...
11257000	11258000	But that's also digital stuff.
11258000	11261000	I mean, I guess I buy everything digitally.
11261000	11263000	Yeah, I mean, I do like having...
11263000	11264000	You're right.
11264000	11265000	It's a digital thing.
11265000	11270000	But, you know, so they're basically offering me the $10 I get for selling it used up front.
11270000	11275000	I've run out of space in my case to hold all the games we have now, so...
11275000	11276000	I need a bigger case.
11276000	11280000	Bob Coffee in chat says, I prefer physical, but if I can get eShop cards on the cheap
11280000	11283000	and I know it's a game I'll play all the time, I may consider digital.
11283000	11286000	SJ100Matt says, probably Marvel Ultimate Alliance 3 and something else.
11286000	11289000	So, yeah, that's a Switch thing that's coming before too long.
11289000	11290000	Yeah.
11290000	11291000	So, yeah, for sure.
11291000	11292000	If it's on there, yeah.
11292000	11295000	Anyway, can you guys hear Alan cooking in the other room?
11295000	11296000	Because the sizzling is loud.
11296000	11297000	It smells good.
11297000	11298000	Yeah, I think he's making...
11298000	11299000	Cat's waiting there for food.
11299000	11300000	Yeah, I know.
11300000	11301000	The cat is excited.
11301000	11302000	All right.
11302000	11304000	Well, anyway, since nobody else is in the green room, I think we'll go ahead and wrap
11304000	11306000	up there because we've been running for about three hours now.
11306000	11308000	So we do want to bring the show to a close.
11308000	11309000	Thank you.
11309000	11310000	I don't know why tonight's show is so long.
11310000	11311000	It's weird.
11311000	11314000	Anyway, we do want to thank you guys so much for listening to our show tonight and tuning
11314000	11315000	in and participating.
11315000	11316000	Thank you as always.
11316000	11320000	We are the show where every gamer has a voice, but as we say here on air, if you tell a friend
11320000	11322000	or two about the show, help us spread the word.
11322000	11326000	It gets more voices here and more folks participating with us and more people to join in on the
11326000	11327000	fun.
11327000	11328000	So that's it.
11328000	11332000	We will be back in two weeks to see you again.
11332000	11335000	We will not be here next Sunday, but please come out for Bobby Blackwolf.
11335000	11336000	He'll still be here.
11336000	11338000	And it sounds like Loki might be doing something afterwards.
11338000	11339000	I may.
11339000	11340000	Yeah, we'll see.
11340000	11341000	You might be able to get your fix if you're around on Sunday.
11341000	11343000	I want to do something fun and special.
11343000	11346000	It's probably just going to be something new.
11346000	11348000	I think even DDR they'd be down.
11348000	11349000	Probably just DDR.
11349000	11350000	Don't sell yourself short.
11350000	11351000	It's not just DDR.
11351000	11352000	It's Loki DDR.
11352000	11353000	Yes.
11353000	11354000	Yeah.
11354000	11355000	I haven't played in a few weeks.
11355000	11357000	I've been like busy with other things, but I will try.
11357000	11360000	I want to get back into all that stuff again.
11360000	11361000	Fair enough.
11361000	11362000	All right.
11362000	11364000	So let's get everybody's final thought.
11364000	11366000	Dar Sakura, have a great time at DragCon.
11366000	11368000	I will have a great time in Chicago.
11368000	11369000	I will.
11369000	11370000	Bring me back chocolate.
11370000	11371000	Oh, you want your chocolates?
11371000	11372000	I want my chocolates.
11372000	11373000	All right.
11373000	11374000	We'll see what we can do.
11374000	11375000	Your chocolates are expensive, but...
11375000	11379000	Well, I'll see if I can get you a shade button if they're selling them this year.
11379000	11380000	Okay.
11380000	11381000	We'll make a trade.
11381000	11382000	Okay.
11382000	11383000	All right.
11383000	11385000	Any final thoughts for our listeners?
11385000	11388000	I think I'm going to stop for something on the way home.
11388000	11389000	For reasons.
11389000	11390000	For reasons.
11390000	11391000	For reasons.
11391000	11392000	Also, I...
11392000	11393000	Cheers.
11393000	11394000	Or whatever.
11394000	11395000	All right.
11395000	11399000	My final thought for the night is go enlightened in Chicago.
11399000	11400000	Come on, team.
11400000	11402000	We can do it.
11402000	11403000	Loki, your final thought tonight?
11403000	11407000	My final thought is I can't wait to be disappointed by Game of Thrones.
11407000	11410000	It could be over and I'll have to watch it again.
11410000	11411000	Sounds great.
11411000	11413000	Until your wife finds something else to watch, right?
11413000	11414000	All right.
11414000	11415000	Oh, she's already going to find something.
11415000	11416000	Right.
11416000	11418000	That's going to do it for another episode here of Orange Launch Radio.
