Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
With your hosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

00:14.000 --> 00:27.000
Tonight, Pandemonium in Sacramento. I'm gonna be up front here and say that we've all been surprisingly busy and are cutting it way too close to deadlines, but the show must go on. Stay tuned for all the news that we are here to cover starting right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:46.000
Hello, my friends out there on the internet. Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight with episode number 700, 776 for this May the 12th of 2019.

00:46.000 --> 00:53.000
And I'm actually half laughing and half tongue tied because everything that Jason said there in the intro tonight, accurate. Completely accurate.

00:53.000 --> 01:01.000
But joining me for this mass hysteria of what's going on before the show tonight, Techmaster Loki joining me here in studio.

01:01.000 --> 01:02.000
Hello.

01:02.000 --> 01:03.000
Hello, how are you?

01:03.000 --> 01:04.000
I'm fine.

01:04.000 --> 01:13.000
Yeah. Part of the craziness tonight, not joining us tonight, DarkSakura or Jamie Summers. She had a conflict with some Mother's Day plans, things going on, so she's not gonna be able to join us tonight.

01:13.000 --> 01:21.000
We wish her well, of course, and of course, to all our mothers out there celebrating all our gaming moms and mom figures and so forth, a happy Mother's Day to all of you.

01:21.000 --> 01:29.000
And for those folks who aren't so into today for a variety of reasonable reasons, I see you and I hope you're doing okay today.

01:29.000 --> 01:36.000
But anyway, Loki, how has your day been? Busy? Because mine's been pretty busy.

01:36.000 --> 01:56.000
It wasn't that busy. I didn't do a whole lot. Just chores. I went and grabbed groceries and did laundry and took the kids to the park briefly and did some work and had to settle for a crappy subway.

01:56.000 --> 02:04.000
Well, because I thought there's even more traffic because Google Maps is telling me it's gonna take 40 minutes to get here.

02:04.000 --> 02:14.000
Yes. Meanwhile, by the way, there was a shootout on the freeway not far from where we record OLR and I was like texting Loki. I was like, yeah, it took me 30 minutes to get downtown earlier when it should take me like 10.

02:14.000 --> 02:20.000
You might want to just be careful getting out here. And I guess that just cleared up. But yes.

02:21.000 --> 02:33.000
It just cleared up. So I went to the subway that's by my work because that's on the way. And for no reason other than just to inconvenience my life, they decided to be closed.

02:33.000 --> 02:44.000
Even though they're technically open because their hours stay open, they decided just I don't want to work. And so I was like, of course this would happen.

02:44.000 --> 02:54.000
I never come here. But then, of course, now it happens like this. So then I went to another subway and I got my sandwich and it says subpar as I remember it.

02:54.000 --> 03:07.000
You got real problems with your sandwiches. I should mention, so even the Dark Soccer, sadly not here tonight, we are going to be joined partway through the show by the ex Jason, or Jason, our voiceover guy.

03:07.000 --> 03:15.000
And let me tell you what a stud Jason is because the bumper that we have tonight, he does for Twitch, we do these little, you can't do that on television parodies.

03:15.000 --> 03:24.000
They don't carry over to the podcast. It's like a five second special thing for Twitch. And he does the videos for that. And he does our intros, which everybody does here on the podcast and everything.

03:24.000 --> 03:35.000
He actually uploaded those from the road. He's in Truckee right now, which is up the hill. And he said he got on a Safeway Wi-Fi and uploaded those videos.

03:35.000 --> 03:43.000
And then he's actually coming down the hill right now. He's going to be here at OLR Studio in probably about an hour, probably around the time the Classic Game of the Week is going.

03:43.000 --> 03:51.000
He's going to pull in here and he'll be able to join us for the second half of the show. And I think it's funny because of his intro, he's like, I don't have really time to do an intro tonight.

03:52.000 --> 03:55.000
And I'm like, I'm okay with it. I think it's hilarious.

03:55.000 --> 04:03.000
And then me. So here's the thing. So I've been gaming today too. And this does relate to video games. Because of course we are the show where every gamer has a voice.

04:03.000 --> 04:09.000
And we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Blackwell show at the Voice of Geeks Network.

04:09.000 --> 04:15.000
Available at voggenetwork.com and live on Twitch every Sunday night and other nights throughout the week too with hosted programming.

04:15.000 --> 04:22.000
Twitch.tv slash voggenetwork. That's V-O-G network. And that's the same place where we read our lovely live chatters.

04:22.000 --> 04:27.000
But today was kind of an Ingress day. You know the mobile phone game I've been playing for a while.

04:27.000 --> 04:34.000
Before there was Pokemon Go, the same company made a game called Ingress. And it doesn't have as many people, nearly as many people play in it.

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
But it's got, I guess, cult popularity, if you will.

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
I played it briefly today.

04:38.000 --> 04:43.000
And they released an anime. I haven't watched it yet. There's like an anime that just came out on Netflix.

04:43.000 --> 04:46.000
It's a show. It's certainly a show.

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
It is a show. That's what I've heard. It's a show.

04:48.000 --> 04:52.000
But it's been a busy day for that because they did what's called Mission Day.

04:52.000 --> 04:58.000
So long story short, you do these, you know, the game encourages you to go out and like explore different parts of the town.

04:58.000 --> 05:02.000
So here in Sacramento we have historical places like Sutter's Fort with the Gold Rush.

05:02.000 --> 05:06.000
The Delta King, the boat hotel that's like on the river and so forth.

05:06.000 --> 05:09.000
So these missions kind of encourage you to go to those places and hack these portals.

05:09.000 --> 05:12.000
And you get little things for your profile.

05:12.000 --> 05:17.000
And, you know, you basically get a little virtual badge, like an achievement if you will.

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
Like you participated in a mission day. Good for you.

05:19.000 --> 05:20.000
Yeah.

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
EPN is plus one. Yay. So there's that.

05:22.000 --> 05:28.000
And then at the same time they do this thing called NL1331X or something like that.

05:28.000 --> 05:34.000
It's the van. There's this Ingress van that travels around the nation and it happened to be in Sacramento today.

05:34.000 --> 05:42.000
The same day as Mother's Day. The same day as the Amgen Bike Race is going on right now, which is a pretty big deal downtown.

05:42.000 --> 05:47.000
The same day as, what's that fucking auction show on PBS that everybody goes crazy about?

05:47.000 --> 05:50.000
Because they're at the Crocker Museum right now. Antique Roadshow, is that it?

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
So that's going on right now.

05:52.000 --> 05:55.000
And so it's like everything that could possibly happen in SAC is going on right now.

05:55.000 --> 05:57.000
But it just so happens this van decided to swing by.

05:57.000 --> 06:01.000
And people just go to the van meetup. Why? I don't know.

06:01.000 --> 06:04.000
It has something to do with the story but who cares about lore.

06:04.000 --> 06:09.000
So that all was happening. So the van thing was from three to six.

06:09.000 --> 06:15.000
So they just wrapped up. So I had to like drive down, check in, get my virtual badge and come right back to get set up for the show.

06:15.000 --> 06:18.000
So I've been very busy myself today. But it's good.

06:18.000 --> 06:22.000
It's good. I've been out, been moving, been walking, seeing some people I haven't seen in a little while.

06:22.000 --> 06:23.000
So everything's been good.

06:23.000 --> 06:28.000
So anyway, going to our chat over Twitch TV slash VOG Network.

06:29.000 --> 06:32.000
Bobby Blackwolf says, but I thought Sacramento was a cow town.

06:32.000 --> 06:36.000
Well, you know, that's what all the people in the Bay Area used to say.

06:36.000 --> 06:39.000
Yet they're all moving here. I wonder what that's about.

06:39.000 --> 06:45.000
There's a couple of cows here but it's actually a pretty big town all things considered.

06:45.000 --> 06:50.000
It's like the number 20 market, TV market in the US. It's a pretty big city, believe it or not.

06:50.000 --> 06:54.000
Anyway, speaking of TV and entertainment.

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
Sacramento's not a cow town. That's Vacaville.

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
All the cows went to Vacaville and Dixon.

06:58.000 --> 07:03.000
Speaking of TV and media and things of consumption, of entertainment.

07:03.000 --> 07:07.000
There's a big movie that came out this week that a lot of y'all are talking about.

07:07.000 --> 07:12.000
It is a movie starring a Pokemon, but the Pokemon look very, very real.

07:12.000 --> 07:16.000
It is called Detective Pikachu. And I think many of you saw it this weekend.

07:16.000 --> 07:19.000
Don't worry. I'm not going to get into spoilers.

07:19.000 --> 07:22.000
So if you didn't see the movie, don't worry. We're not going to ruin it for you.

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
Because I know not everybody can get out to the movies this weekend.

07:24.000 --> 07:29.000
But the movie did very well. It came in number two at the box office with 58 million.

07:29.000 --> 07:33.000
Which actually is still considered very good. Even though you might think, oh, but number two.

07:33.000 --> 07:37.000
It did get beat by Avengers Endgame, but seeing as Avengers Endgame is about,

07:37.000 --> 07:41.000
if it's not already like one of the top two movies of all time, it's about to be...

07:41.000 --> 07:43.000
I think it's beat Titanic.

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
Yeah, and it might even end up being number one pretty soon.

07:45.000 --> 07:48.000
So, I mean, Avengers Endgame is obviously huge right now.

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
So any movie that goes up against it is going to struggle.

07:50.000 --> 07:53.000
But 58 million going against that really isn't bad.

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
It did very well for a video game movie.

07:55.000 --> 07:59.000
I think it's worth saying it reviewed well for a video game movie.

07:59.000 --> 08:02.000
I mean, it's not going to win an Oscar.

08:02.000 --> 08:07.000
Well, when it comes to visuals and those sort of techy awards, it might. I don't know.

08:07.000 --> 08:11.000
But acting and story ain't going to win an Oscar for that. Let's be real.

08:11.000 --> 08:18.000
But I saw the movie, which for those that know me, I very rarely get out to movies at all.

08:18.000 --> 08:22.000
But I did go see Detective Pikachu, and you did as well, right? Loki?

08:22.000 --> 08:23.000
Yeah.

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
So what did you think? Spoiler-free review, what did you think?

08:25.000 --> 08:27.000
I thought it was good. I liked it.

08:27.000 --> 08:28.000
Yeah?

08:28.000 --> 08:31.000
Yeah, I mean, I enjoyed the movie.

08:31.000 --> 08:37.000
I've never played the game, so I don't know how closely it follows that storyline.

08:37.000 --> 08:38.000
But I thought it was entertaining.

08:38.000 --> 08:44.000
I have not played the game either, but my understanding is that it does deviate a bit from the game.

08:44.000 --> 08:47.000
Like, there's ideas in the game that kind of come over.

08:47.000 --> 08:52.000
If you've played and beat the game, there's some story changes that are going to be.

08:52.000 --> 08:58.000
And my understanding is there's a character that's way more prevalent in the movie than they are in the game,

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
and some little changes like that.

09:00.000 --> 09:06.000
But I'm not familiar with the game myself, but I sure enjoyed the movie. I did.

09:06.000 --> 09:13.000
What I loved about the movie is that it didn't apologize for Pokémon being real, and they always have been real.

09:13.000 --> 09:18.000
And I will say, actually, probably one of my favorite parts of the movie was the first five minutes,

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
which I don't think it's too spoilery to say.

09:20.000 --> 09:25.000
Instead of just kind of jumping right into the scene where the movie takes place,

09:25.000 --> 09:31.000
you have some exposition, you have some setup that's a little more like the Pokémon you might be familiar with,

09:31.000 --> 09:36.000
that you actually go out into the world and catch a Pokémon and try to imprison it in the ball and that whole thing.

09:36.000 --> 09:39.000
And they actually kind of do this, and you're looking at this going,

09:39.000 --> 09:45.000
these are like grown-ass adults going out and trying to catch Pokémon.

09:45.000 --> 09:48.000
And I'm kind of like, oh, just like Pokémon Go is.

09:48.000 --> 09:51.000
Oh, this is what I look like. Oh, no.

09:51.000 --> 09:57.000
But as an adult who does go out and catch Pokémon once in a while through a cell phone, I kind of live for it.

09:57.000 --> 10:02.000
I loved it. And they do this little setup, and they're, I don't think this is a spoiler, I can say,

10:02.000 --> 10:07.000
they're showing caveman-type pictures, trying to explain hieroglyphics, right?

10:07.000 --> 10:09.000
And the Pokémon are just there in the hieroglyphics, right?

10:09.000 --> 10:12.000
Again, this is all in the first five minutes, so I'm not ruining anything.

10:12.000 --> 10:17.000
So I just love that. I just loved how it's like, hey, Pokémon are real.

10:17.000 --> 10:22.000
Now, you don't ever see a cat or a dog in the movie.

10:22.000 --> 10:26.000
Like cats and dogs, the domesticated animals we think of, just don't exist.

10:26.000 --> 10:29.000
Like every bird is a Pidgey or a Spearow.

10:29.000 --> 10:34.000
Every place you would expect to see a puppy, you see like a Bulbasaur or something else, you know what I mean?

10:34.000 --> 10:38.000
So it does make some changes to society as we know it, but I liked it.

10:38.000 --> 10:42.000
Like I was, I was just, yeah. And I thought, you know, the story wasn't bad.

10:42.000 --> 10:51.000
The ending, you know, or I should say the end sequence, the last third got a little bit like, you know,

10:51.000 --> 10:55.000
I mean, it wasn't bad, but it was just a little like, okay, you know, interesting.

10:55.000 --> 11:01.000
But I loved how it ended. And that's obviously, I won't keep us waiting for it, but I loved how it ended.

11:01.000 --> 11:07.000
I thought the ending was like, and you don't usually say that about like movies and especially games that become movies,

11:07.000 --> 11:11.000
but I really liked how it ended. And that's all I'm going to say about that.

11:11.000 --> 11:15.000
And chat, please respect. And don't, don't spoil nothing.

11:15.000 --> 11:20.000
So, yeah, I understand they've already greenlit the sequel.

11:20.000 --> 11:26.000
They greenlit the sequel before this came out. So they made the right call because this did well at the box office.

11:26.000 --> 11:32.000
That's going to be interesting. Yeah. Considering, but okay.

11:32.000 --> 11:37.000
I'll have to see how that, and maybe we'll get Detective Badoop after all.

11:37.000 --> 11:42.000
Looking at comments over at Twitch TV slash VOG Network, Bobby Blackwell says,

11:42.000 --> 11:49.000
my main comment on my show is that Danny DeVito could not have been Pikachu in the story they chose to tell in the movie.

11:49.000 --> 11:55.000
It would have to be a different story. I kind of think I know where you're going with that.

11:55.000 --> 11:59.000
And I get it. Yeah, no, I, I, I'm fine. I'm fine with Ryan.

11:59.000 --> 12:03.000
Like perhaps Dane DeVito could be Detective Bidoof.

12:03.000 --> 12:08.000
Why, why couldn't Danny DeVito be in the sequel? It's a different Pokemon. I would actually like totally live for that.

12:08.000 --> 12:14.000
I think that would be great. So you never know. You never know. After all, Danny DeVito was in the Batman sequel.

12:14.000 --> 12:22.000
Anyway, um, let's see. Tiger Claw on chat says, having seen Detective Pikachu, does it want you to get the actual game now that you know what happened?

12:22.000 --> 12:33.000
I have to be honest. No, like I feel like I, I'm in the Pokemon universe enough with Pokemon Go and playing the mainline games and playing Let's Go Pikachu.

12:33.000 --> 12:38.000
I don't really feel the need to seek out the Detective Pikachu 3DS game and go back and play it.

12:38.000 --> 12:45.000
I mean, if a free copy ended up in my lap, I would probably check it out. But the reality is, you know, my 3DS.

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
Are you going to get the oversized amiibo?

12:47.000 --> 12:54.000
My 3DS is kind of gathering dust at this point, so they would need to re-release it on Switch, which I don't know if they would do that or not.

12:54.000 --> 12:57.000
Would I get the oversized amiibo? Sure. It was cute. I like the oversized amiibo. It was cute.

12:57.000 --> 13:04.000
So, um, ActDeft in chat says no Vulpix though. Zero out of 10. Worst movie ever.

13:04.000 --> 13:10.000
Yeah. You're not going to see every Pokemon, but maybe it was there just in the background somewhere. Who knows?

13:10.000 --> 13:18.000
It doesn't rely on just Gen 1 Pokemon either. Like, other generations of Pokemon play a very big part in the story.

13:18.000 --> 13:21.000
I think everybody kind of generally knows because you've seen the trailer.

13:21.000 --> 13:26.000
Aipoms, the monkeys with the hand, the fighting monkeys with the hand, they factor into the story.

13:26.000 --> 13:29.000
That's a Gen 3 Pokemon. 3 or 4. I think it's 3.

13:29.000 --> 13:34.000
Snubbull factors pretty heavy in the story. That's Gen 2. And there's others as well.

13:34.000 --> 13:40.000
So, um, most of the generations of Pokemon right on up through, I think, even 6 to 7 are represented.

13:40.000 --> 13:45.000
So, uh, they, you know, and again, not all of them because there's like, what, 750 Pokemon.

13:45.000 --> 13:50.000
So not every Pokemon is represented, but there's a good, there's a good smattering of the different generations.

13:50.000 --> 13:54.000
And it's not just like all Pikachu. It's just Pikachu's the main character, obviously.

13:54.000 --> 14:01.000
So, um, let's see. Also in chat, uh, Tigerlast says they need to do a Pokemon movie about Ash.

14:01.000 --> 14:07.000
You know, with how well this did, it's possible. I don't know.

14:07.000 --> 14:11.000
Do you think it would be interesting to go back and tell the story of the anime and Team Rocket?

14:11.000 --> 14:16.000
I would like a new story that's still in the same universe that has Ash and stuff.

14:16.000 --> 14:21.000
Maybe we don't have to retell the whole thing, but just have Team Rocket in there and have all, but like a brand new story.

14:21.000 --> 14:24.000
You know, I kind of like, I will say one thing that I kind of like what they did.

14:24.000 --> 14:29.000
Because remember when they first announced the detective Pikachu, I think a lot of us were going,

14:29.000 --> 14:33.000
Why, why are you adapting the spinoff? Why aren't you just adapting?

14:33.000 --> 14:37.000
If you want to make Pokemon real, adapt the main games or adapt the anime.

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
You already have, like, why are they doing detective Pikachu?

14:39.000 --> 14:45.000
But I have to say, I get it. Like the way the re, because they adapted that,

14:45.000 --> 14:51.000
they were able to kind of take some light liberties with the story to make it work better as a movie.

14:51.000 --> 14:58.000
I think, I think they were able to bend a lot of rules that people would expect if they had just made the games or made,

14:58.000 --> 15:02.000
you know, that, and I think that allowed this video game movie to work.

15:02.000 --> 15:10.000
So isn't that interesting that sometimes the more successful video game movies are based on not so popular video games.

15:10.000 --> 15:14.000
I mean, that hasn't always been true, but the Super Mario Brothers movie, we all know that was a flop, right?

15:14.000 --> 15:19.000
But like Silent Hill, I thought was probably the best video game, not everybody agrees with that,

15:19.000 --> 15:23.000
but I thought it was probably the best video game movie and that, you know, isn't as big as-

15:23.000 --> 15:26.000
They have like a kind of a teaser and like within the first 30 seconds,

15:26.000 --> 15:30.000
it kind of shows what that would kind of look like anyway, with like some of the battling and everything.

15:30.000 --> 15:31.000
So that was pretty awesome.

15:31.000 --> 15:35.000
Sure, sure. So anyway, you know, again, I'll stop talking about the movies.

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
I don't want to give anything away, but I, you know, kudos.

15:37.000 --> 15:41.000
I thought the team did a good job and it's not often we can get on this show and say,

15:41.000 --> 15:44.000
this was a video game movie that was, was good.

15:44.000 --> 15:47.000
Like I'm not sitting here going, Oh my God, it's the best thing ever.

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
But it was, I liked it well enough.

15:49.000 --> 15:53.000
And I think, I think it is up there with like Silent Hill and Mortal Kombat.

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
And in fact, I mean, here's the thing.

15:55.000 --> 15:58.000
I really liked Silent Hill, probably more than most people did.

15:58.000 --> 16:03.000
So like Detective Pikachu is on like that same level as Silent Hill,

16:03.000 --> 16:06.000
but some of y'all I know didn't like Silent Hill.

16:06.000 --> 16:09.000
So you might think that's not exactly a compliment, but I really like Silent Hill.

16:09.000 --> 16:13.000
So I think it's right on up there about the same level as Silent Hill and I'll go see the sequel for sure.

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
And now I'm kind of curious, like, huh,

16:15.000 --> 16:19.000
maybe this is going to get people interested in adapting video games as movies again.

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
And maybe there'll be, you know,

16:21.000 --> 16:24.000
maybe now it'll be about adapting maybe some lesser known games,

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
but that have very solid stories.

16:26.000 --> 16:27.000
It'll be very interesting to see what happens.

16:27.000 --> 16:30.000
So until they see Sonic the Hedgehog and then they're like, Oh, right.

16:30.000 --> 16:34.000
That's, that's how, that's, that's what most of them in the play Sonic,

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
the Sonic movie ruins everything.

16:36.000 --> 16:37.000
I don't, I don't know.

16:37.000 --> 16:40.000
It's too early to say that I gained all this ground and then he brought it all the way back.

16:40.000 --> 16:44.000
I don't think Sonic's going to perform on the same level as Detective Pikachu,

16:44.000 --> 16:49.000
but I don't think it's going to flop by any, it still has Jim Carrey.

16:49.000 --> 16:52.000
It's still a property that a lot of people know.

16:52.000 --> 16:55.000
So parents are going to be willing to take their kids.

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
So I, you know, and I don't want to,

16:57.000 --> 17:00.000
I don't want to retread the Sonic ground because we talked enough about that last week,

17:00.000 --> 17:01.000
but I don't think Sonic's going to flop.

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
I think the internet's giving it a lot of crap,

17:03.000 --> 17:07.000
but I think at the end of the day it will do well enough,

17:07.000 --> 17:10.000
but it's not going to, it's not going to beat this Detective Pikachu,

17:10.000 --> 17:16.000
but it's not going to flopzilla like, um, the original Mario Brothers movie or what,

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
what video game movies have really underperformed?

17:18.000 --> 17:19.000
Double Dragon.

17:19.000 --> 17:20.000
Oh, Double Dragon, yeah.

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
It's not going to be a Double Dragon flopzilla or anything like that.

17:22.000 --> 17:25.000
Or the Street Fighter movie I don't think did very well for its title.

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
Uh, both of them.

17:27.000 --> 17:30.000
Remember, there was a Chung Lee Street Fighter film.

17:30.000 --> 17:33.000
Yeah, there was. I know, I know. I never saw it.

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
I'm probably lucky. Anyway.

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
So there's other Pokemon news, right?

17:37.000 --> 17:42.000
So while we all have Pokemon Fever, this is a great time to talk about other Pokemon things going on,

17:42.000 --> 17:43.000
not even Jet 8.

17:43.000 --> 17:51.000
Yeah, and so there's a brief, a brief announcement that they're going to be working on a new, uh, mobile game for, um,

17:51.000 --> 17:58.000
yeah, it's, it's basically the Pokemon company and DNA that are teaming up to make a new mobile game

17:58.000 --> 18:02.000
that's going to release two smartphones by next year.

18:02.000 --> 18:07.000
Um, but there's nothing other than that they're making one.

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
So we don't know what the hell it is.

18:09.000 --> 18:12.000
So Pokemon games on mobile, far from a done deal.

18:12.000 --> 18:16.000
Even though we have, you know, Pokemon Go obviously is kind of the behemoth right now.

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
But remember, there are other Pokemon games that exist.

18:18.000 --> 18:21.000
There's that silly Magikarp, Magikarp jumping game.

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
I don't remember what it was called, Splash or something like that.

18:23.000 --> 18:27.000
Uh, there's that, there's the match three game that was on DS they put on mobile as well.

18:27.000 --> 18:31.000
So, you know, there are other Pokemon games on mobile, so it, you know, makes sense.

18:31.000 --> 18:37.000
Well, isn't it interesting that here we are all these years later and Pokemon is still a big deal.

18:37.000 --> 18:40.000
I think that in itself is kind of noteworthy, right?

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
Like this is a video game franchise.

18:42.000 --> 18:46.000
These are characters that have been around a very long time.

18:46.000 --> 18:49.000
I mean, the Pokemon games started in what, like 97, right?

18:49.000 --> 18:50.000
In the anime and all that.

18:50.000 --> 18:54.000
Cause I remember it was like my first year, maybe a little sooner actually, maybe a couple of years before that.

18:54.000 --> 18:59.000
But you know, it was the mid to late nineties and Pokemon has had that kind of staying power where like,

18:59.000 --> 19:02.000
you know, it's still a box office smash.

19:02.000 --> 19:08.000
I don't even think it's staying power because now it's like it's getting new followers and new fans of the game

19:08.000 --> 19:13.000
because of their other spinoff games that they've done like Pokemon Go or Pokemon Let's Go,

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
which is kind of a retread of the first game.

19:15.000 --> 19:20.000
So I think you have all that to thank for it as well.

19:20.000 --> 19:23.000
What is it about Pokemon that people just love?

19:23.000 --> 19:26.000
Is it that the characters are just cute?

19:26.000 --> 19:29.000
Is it just we can't get enough of how adorable Pikachu is?

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
And when they pika, the little ways they talk.

19:31.000 --> 19:36.000
Like what is it about Pokemon that just people are still crazy about 20 years later?

19:36.000 --> 19:37.000
People think they're cute.

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
People just think they're cute?

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
Yeah, people think they're cute.

19:41.000 --> 19:47.000
Is it weird to say that when you watch the movie, you can't help but go, I want to go to this place.

19:47.000 --> 19:53.000
I want to go to this place where all these, you know, creatures are like real and adorable and all that stuff.

19:54.000 --> 20:00.000
One of the scenes that really sold me on how Detective Pikachu kind of nailed it and the Pokemon formula,

20:00.000 --> 20:04.000
and I'm not ruining anything because you can actually see this scene in the trailer, right?

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
Everybody knows the Jigglypuffs in the movie, right?

20:06.000 --> 20:12.000
So there's this scene when they go to like a nightclub or a seedy bar type of thing, right?

20:12.000 --> 20:16.000
And you can see the Jigglypuff and it's not the focus of the scene.

20:16.000 --> 20:19.000
It's just like establishing that we're at a seedy bar.

20:19.000 --> 20:27.000
And so you see Jigglypuff singing karaoke and there's a guy just dead ass asleep on the bar right there.

20:27.000 --> 20:29.000
And they don't acknowledge it.

20:29.000 --> 20:34.000
They don't talk about like, oh, it's funny because Jigglypuff's voice puts people to sleep.

20:34.000 --> 20:38.000
It's just one of those things where if you have a base familiarity with Pokemon,

20:38.000 --> 20:44.000
that's really fucking funny that the guy's asleep on the bar right next to the Jigglypuff singing.

20:44.000 --> 20:47.000
So I just, I don't know, I just love that.

20:47.000 --> 20:51.000
And yeah, so anyway, looking in chat.

20:51.000 --> 20:52.000
Oh, I'm sorry.

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
Act Def says it's a cafe, not a bar.

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
Sorry, it is a family friendly movie.

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
I'm sorry, it's a cafe, not a bar.

20:58.000 --> 20:59.000
It looked like a bar to me.

20:59.000 --> 21:00.000
Come on.

21:00.000 --> 21:01.000
All right.

21:01.000 --> 21:04.000
It was a coffee bar.

21:04.000 --> 21:09.000
The Solar Bear in chat says I'm actually upset how little of Jigglypuff there was.

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
Hey, a lot of Pokemon got cut.

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
So we were blessed just to have that one scene.

21:13.000 --> 21:18.000
Although it would have been even better if she'd drone on somebody's face with a marker and that whole thing.

21:18.000 --> 21:22.000
I also want to acknowledge chat because you were talking about the video game movies

21:22.000 --> 21:25.000
and how sometimes lesser known games might make for better stories.

21:25.000 --> 21:29.000
But multiple folks in chat were bringing up Uwe Boll, right?

21:29.000 --> 21:31.000
The curse on video game movies, right?

21:31.000 --> 21:38.000
And Uwe Boll kind of like his MO was adapting lesser known video games and really fucking them up.

21:38.000 --> 21:42.000
Like BloodRayne and House of the Dead was one.

21:42.000 --> 21:45.000
They did the Dungeon Siege, right?

21:45.000 --> 21:46.000
Alone in the Dark.

21:46.000 --> 21:52.000
So I guess maybe Uwe Boll kind of ruined that whole thing with lesser known video games.

21:52.000 --> 21:53.000
But I mean thank-

21:53.000 --> 21:54.000
But it's been a long time.

21:54.000 --> 21:55.000
It has been a while.

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
Uwe Boll's kind of been laughed out of the industry at this point.

21:57.000 --> 22:00.000
I don't think he's really doing anything with movie making these days.

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
So I think we've had time to recover.

22:02.000 --> 22:03.000
And obviously-

22:03.000 --> 22:04.000
And Postal. He did Postal.

22:04.000 --> 22:14.000
But Pikachu and Pokemon in general are a very different type of franchise than all that crap.

22:14.000 --> 22:18.000
He was adapting a lot of more adult R-rated types of things, right?

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
He was basically-

22:20.000 --> 22:24.000
What he did is like, I want to make this type of movie.

22:24.000 --> 22:30.000
Which property can I buy that I can use to make this type of movie?

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
And then he would do that.

22:32.000 --> 22:35.000
Like, some of them made no goddamn sense.

22:35.000 --> 22:39.000
Like for example, I want to make a Western.

22:39.000 --> 22:44.000
So which property should I purchase to make a Western?

22:44.000 --> 22:45.000
Gun.smoke.

22:45.000 --> 22:48.000
I know! How about Blood Rain?

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
Because that was the third fucking Blood Rain movie.

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
And it was goddamn awful.

22:52.000 --> 22:56.000
Sia Tabiri in chat says, how can I fit Tara Reid in?

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
Well, I mean Tara Reid should be put in every movie.

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
And I got to interview him. So that was fun.

23:00.000 --> 23:03.000
He was at a convention here in Sacramento last year or the year before.

23:03.000 --> 23:04.000
Yeah, I know.

23:04.000 --> 23:09.000
I had other plans. There was an Ingers fan or something.

23:09.000 --> 23:10.000
Let's see.

23:10.000 --> 23:15.000
The Solar Baron chat says, now that you've said his name three times, he'll be back. Thanks Rob.

23:15.000 --> 23:17.000
Well, sorry about that.

23:17.000 --> 23:22.000
But I think there's going to be other people in video game movies right now because of how well Detective Pikachu did.

23:22.000 --> 23:25.000
And we already know there's a new Mario Brothers movie.

23:26.000 --> 23:32.000
Obviously Hollywood wants you to forget they ever made a Mario Brothers movie with Dennis Hopper and Bob Hoskins.

23:32.000 --> 23:35.000
They're never going to acknowledge that again.

23:35.000 --> 23:38.000
So they're basically doing a new Super Mario Brothers movie that's animated.

23:38.000 --> 23:41.000
That's the thing we know is coming. Is that next year? Or is it 2021?

23:41.000 --> 23:43.000
But it's in the near future.

23:43.000 --> 23:48.000
I can't remember if that's a 2020 film or 2021, but it's coming.

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
So it'll be interesting.

23:50.000 --> 23:54.000
And if that does well too, that may unleash the floodgates for other Nintendo things.

23:54.000 --> 23:59.000
I mean, we may finally get that Zelda movie. A lot of us have been waiting on for some time and so forth.

23:59.000 --> 24:00.000
So we'll see.

24:00.000 --> 24:01.000
Let's see.

24:01.000 --> 24:05.000
Some folks in chat. Tigerclaw talking about the Angry Birds movie 2.

24:05.000 --> 24:08.000
I often forget that Angry Birds is a video game thing.

24:08.000 --> 24:11.000
Because it's a little different with the cell phone thing. It's a little more casual.

24:11.000 --> 24:12.000
Yeah.

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
I mean, it certainly qualifies.

24:14.000 --> 24:18.000
It was okay.

24:18.000 --> 24:21.000
I've watched the movie way too many times.

24:21.000 --> 24:23.000
Because you're kids, right?

24:23.000 --> 24:25.000
Not of your own accord.

24:25.000 --> 24:28.000
No, I've watched it way too many times.

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
And it was all right. It wasn't good.

24:30.000 --> 24:34.000
But it wasn't as bad as, say, the Smurfs or something.

24:34.000 --> 24:40.000
And actually, I would put that as a good barometer for where I think Sonic the Hedgehog could be.

24:40.000 --> 24:43.000
I don't know.

24:43.000 --> 24:46.000
The problem with Angry Birds and with a lot of things is there's no plot to it.

24:46.000 --> 24:52.000
You're taking a game that has no story and then you're trying to inject a story into it.

24:52.000 --> 24:56.000
And so it's like they did their best. And it was all right.

24:56.000 --> 25:00.000
I don't know. I think...

25:00.000 --> 25:03.000
I'd watch the sequel when it comes out on Netflix or something.

25:03.000 --> 25:06.000
But I'm not going to go to the movie for it.

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
No more of that.

25:08.000 --> 25:09.000
Probably not.

25:09.000 --> 25:11.000
Unless the kids really want to go.

25:11.000 --> 25:14.000
In which case, I would. But I'm probably not.

25:14.000 --> 25:17.000
The Solar Bear points out there is story.

25:17.000 --> 25:21.000
Piggies want eggs. Birds kill piggies to get their eggs back.

25:21.000 --> 25:25.000
And Bobby Blackwell is reminding us of, remember, Smurfs was a box office success.

25:25.000 --> 25:27.000
And that's true. And that's why I keep saying,

25:27.000 --> 25:31.000
I don't think Sonic is going to flop the way all the gamers say it's going to.

25:31.000 --> 25:37.000
I think that same market that's allowed the Smurfs and the Chipmunks and those types of movies to succeed,

25:37.000 --> 25:40.000
I think Sonic will be okay.

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
I think it's going to be great. I think it's going to be bleh.

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
I think it's just going to be all right.

25:44.000 --> 25:48.000
It'll get a Netflix sequel and that'll be the thing.

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
But we'll see. Maybe I'll be pleasantly surprised. We'll see.

25:50.000 --> 25:54.000
I just, I don't know. I hoped better for Sonic.

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
You know, like, granted.

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
The movie's not out yet.

25:58.000 --> 25:59.000
Just saying.

25:59.000 --> 26:02.000
Yeah, but I mean.

26:02.000 --> 26:06.000
They're already, like, it's already too far gone.

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
I mean, like, they're going to make him look okay.

26:08.000 --> 26:13.000
Fine. But I hope they, I actually wish they'd make him look worse.

26:13.000 --> 26:15.000
Like, make it just look goddamn terrible.

26:15.000 --> 26:18.000
Not to get too far distant from the video games topic,

26:18.000 --> 26:21.000
since we are a video game show, but speaking of movies and trailers

26:21.000 --> 26:24.000
that get bad reception and things that might be too far gone,

26:24.000 --> 26:27.000
you know, the trailers, oddly enough,

26:27.000 --> 26:29.000
I feel like we were the one theater that didn't get the Sonic trailer

26:29.000 --> 26:31.000
ahead of the...

26:31.000 --> 26:32.000
No, we didn't get it either.

26:32.000 --> 26:33.000
Oh, okay.

26:33.000 --> 26:36.000
Or I may have missed it because I had to take my kid to the bathroom,

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
even though I said, go to the bathroom before we leave.

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
And, yeah.

26:40.000 --> 26:43.000
But what we did see is we saw the trailer for the Lion King remake,

26:43.000 --> 26:44.000
which looks really good.

26:44.000 --> 26:45.000
Oh, yeah, yeah.

26:45.000 --> 26:47.000
But, oddly, and I still can't believe these are coming out so quick to each other,

26:47.000 --> 26:52.000
but they have both the Aladdin and the Lion King remake are out this summer.

26:52.000 --> 26:55.000
And Aladdin, you know, a lot of people had some feelings

26:55.000 --> 26:59.000
about how Genie's CGI looked in that movie.

26:59.000 --> 27:03.000
So I'll be very curious to see what that translates to in receipts.

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
I still think that Aladdin movie's gonna do really good.

27:05.000 --> 27:07.000
Lion King will do better.

27:07.000 --> 27:11.000
But I feel like Disney is probably gonna regret putting Aladdin and Lion King out,

27:11.000 --> 27:13.000
like, practically back to back.

27:13.000 --> 27:15.000
But what do I know? I'm not a Hollywood guy.

27:15.000 --> 27:17.000
It feels like it's a lot.

27:17.000 --> 27:20.000
It feels like just cashing in on nostalgia, which is Disney's M.O.

27:20.000 --> 27:25.000
But, to be fair, the audience has shown through their dollars that's what they want.

27:25.000 --> 27:29.000
I'm just surprised they have so many movies coming out this year,

27:29.000 --> 27:33.000
because, like, Disney, like, this year they've got, like, so much stuff coming out.

27:33.000 --> 27:36.000
Even from just Disney proper, they have the Aladdin movie,

27:36.000 --> 27:39.000
they have the Lion King movie, they have Frozen 2,

27:39.000 --> 27:42.000
then Pixar, you've got, you know, Toy Story 4,

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
and then, of course, we're talking...

27:44.000 --> 27:47.000
Disney owns Fox, so you've got all that, too.

27:47.000 --> 27:49.000
It's just, it's a ton of shit.

27:49.000 --> 27:50.000
The Solar Baron chat says,

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
I'm going to see Aladdin but not Lion King.

27:52.000 --> 27:55.000
This better not, the level of disrespect against Beyoncé,

27:55.000 --> 27:57.000
it's far too much. Far too much.

27:57.000 --> 27:59.000
I'd be curious what your thoughts are with that.

27:59.000 --> 28:01.000
I think some people are really put off by the talking animals.

28:01.000 --> 28:05.000
Because it looks like, in The Lion King, it's like 100% talking animals.

28:05.000 --> 28:07.000
And I guess that's weird to some people.

28:07.000 --> 28:09.000
This is not cartoon.

28:09.000 --> 28:13.000
I want a Sonic the Hedgehog movie based on the Sonic Twitter account.

28:13.000 --> 28:16.000
You know, full of memes and just self-aware.

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
That's my Sonic movie right there.

28:18.000 --> 28:19.000
Okay, alright.

28:19.000 --> 28:20.000
Let's move on.

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
We could talk probably hours and hours about Hollywood,

28:22.000 --> 28:25.000
but we want to talk about some more games.

28:25.000 --> 28:28.000
So let's talk about the types of video games that we've been playing this week

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
in a segment that we call How Was Your Gaming Week?

28:30.000 --> 28:31.000
So, Loki, how was your gaming week?

28:31.000 --> 28:33.000
Not good, and I'll tell you why.

28:33.000 --> 28:36.000
Because I've been working 50 to 60 hour weeks at work,

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
at home, doing additional work.

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
So, unfortunately, because of that,

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
I have not been playing games.

28:42.000 --> 28:47.000
I've been just staying up till one in the morning doing work, work.

28:47.000 --> 28:48.000
And that's not fun.

28:48.000 --> 28:49.000
Yikes.

28:49.000 --> 28:54.000
But I did, as is usual when I take my son to his programming class,

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
I work on my programming at the same time.

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
And so I've been working on that.

28:58.000 --> 29:01.000
And I got my health bars done how I wanted them.

29:01.000 --> 29:08.000
So right now they work exactly like the health bars in a Capcom arcade beat-em-up game,

29:08.000 --> 29:09.000
with the color changes and stuff.

29:09.000 --> 29:11.000
I haven't decided, though, if I want to change that.

29:11.000 --> 29:16.000
Because the way they work there is if the life bar's larger than one,

29:16.000 --> 29:19.000
it's just a certain color until it finally gets down to yellow,

29:19.000 --> 29:22.000
then starts going away.

29:22.000 --> 29:25.000
Whereas I may just have it keep going away

29:25.000 --> 29:28.000
and filling back up as it goes through each of the rows.

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
I haven't decided if I wanted to do that.

29:30.000 --> 29:34.000
But right now it works exactly like the Capcom arcade stuff does.

29:34.000 --> 29:37.000
And that's all you're going to find out about it so far.

29:37.000 --> 29:38.000
All right.

29:38.000 --> 29:41.000
But it's taken me like six hours to get that working.

29:41.000 --> 29:44.000
So that's it.

29:44.000 --> 29:48.000
And I played Pokemon and very barely any Ingress.

29:48.000 --> 29:54.000
But just a little bit of the Pokemon Go in between stuff as I'm doing things.

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
Yeah, that's about it.

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
All right. Let's see, my gaming week.

29:58.000 --> 30:02.000
So I already talked a little bit about some of the things I've been doing this week.

30:02.000 --> 30:07.000
But I've also been playing Final Fantasy XIV.

30:07.000 --> 30:10.000
I've played that an awful lot, been playing that still.

30:10.000 --> 30:13.000
And then playing more Beat Saber because it's a good way to get some exercise,

30:13.000 --> 30:15.000
trying to clear some more songs.

30:15.000 --> 30:18.000
I'll probably do that once I get my new Rift.

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
I play more on hard difficulty.

30:20.000 --> 30:24.000
I'm trying to beat more experts, but hard is kind of like my good safe zone right now.

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
So those are most of the songs I'm trying to beat.

30:26.000 --> 30:31.000
I'm trying to get that trophy for getting an S on like 10 or 15 hard songs.

30:31.000 --> 30:33.000
There's a trophy for that, so I've been working on that.

30:33.000 --> 30:35.000
So that's Beat Saber a little bit.

30:35.000 --> 30:38.000
I'm back on my Heroes of the Storm bullshit suddenly.

30:38.000 --> 30:42.000
And I say that with love because it's interesting with the Blizzard games.

30:42.000 --> 30:46.000
I just start playing one a lot here or there.

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
I played a little Overwatch 2 this week.

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
And then as I was in the launcher for Overwatch,

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
I was like, oh, they put Anduin in Heroes of the Storm.

30:52.000 --> 30:56.000
Oh, it's nice to see that Heroes of the Storm is still getting new content.

30:56.000 --> 30:57.000
Oh, I haven't played in a while.

30:57.000 --> 30:58.000
I should go in there and play.

30:58.000 --> 31:01.000
Oh, now I'm doing all my quests, get my gold.

31:01.000 --> 31:03.000
And I'm like, oh, I'm back on that bullshit.

31:03.000 --> 31:06.000
And then in a month or two, I'll be back on my Diablo 3 bullshit.

31:06.000 --> 31:09.000
It's just this cycle that continues with the Blizzard stuff.

31:09.000 --> 31:11.000
It's like a different game pulls me in each month.

31:11.000 --> 31:15.000
So the Heroes of the Storm month has started apparently for me.

31:15.000 --> 31:16.000
So there's that as well.

31:16.000 --> 31:21.000
You haven't tried any of the Overwatch custom game types or anything?

31:21.000 --> 31:23.000
No, the last time I was in Overwatch,

31:23.000 --> 31:25.000
I played just a little bit of Quick Play.

31:25.000 --> 31:28.000
But I did a little bit of that last event before it was done.

31:28.000 --> 31:32.000
So the Overwatch, I don't remember what they called the annual event.

31:32.000 --> 31:36.000
It was like Uprising, but they gave it a different name every year.

31:36.000 --> 31:40.000
So I was like, oh, crap, I got to do that because that ends in two days.

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
So I went in and did the story mode, got my loot box,

31:42.000 --> 31:45.000
got my loot box just from doing some of the arcade stuff.

31:45.000 --> 31:47.000
And I didn't get anything I liked.

31:47.000 --> 31:49.000
I got another McCree skin.

31:49.000 --> 31:53.000
Whenever I get legendary shit, it's McCree or Tracer.

31:53.000 --> 31:56.000
And it's like, I don't play McCree or Tracer ever.

31:56.000 --> 31:57.000
Why can't I have?

31:57.000 --> 31:59.000
Well, I did get a Lucio skin once.

32:00.000 --> 32:05.000
So I probably play Moira, Lucio, Junkrat, probably more than anybody else.

32:05.000 --> 32:07.000
But I like Moira a lot.

32:07.000 --> 32:09.000
I tried to play Batiste.

32:09.000 --> 32:12.000
I couldn't get into it.

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
I had no idea what I was doing.

32:14.000 --> 32:18.000
I died twice and I just switched to Moira so I could feel like I was helping.

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
Because I didn't know what the fuck I was doing as Batiste.

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
So that was too bad.

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
Storm Rising, yeah.

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
Storm Rising says Act Deaf, the Archives event.

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
There it is.

32:28.000 --> 32:32.000
Metal Mayhem says just when Rob thought he was out, a different game pulls him back in.

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
That's how video games work.

32:34.000 --> 32:37.000
You're done with one and another pulls you right in.

32:37.000 --> 32:41.000
So I've also been kind of itching to do another play through of Final Fantasy XII.

32:41.000 --> 32:45.000
Just because the last time I tried to play through on PS4, I didn't finish.

32:45.000 --> 32:47.000
So I have that PC version.

32:47.000 --> 32:49.000
I kind of want to play that. I don't know.

32:49.000 --> 32:52.000
I feel like that's going to be the next thing I get sucked into.

32:52.000 --> 32:53.000
We'll see.

32:53.000 --> 32:57.000
But I have to admit, there haven't been a lot of new games really on my radar as of late.

32:57.000 --> 33:00.000
There's nothing that's like, oh it just came out and I've got to play it.

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
So we'll see.

33:02.000 --> 33:09.000
I'm sure as E3 comes up in the summer and especially as we get into the fall, Nintendo will finally put out that Animal Crossing.

33:09.000 --> 33:11.000
I'll be obsessed.

33:11.000 --> 33:14.000
Pokemon Gen 8, I'm really looking forward to.

33:14.000 --> 33:17.000
There will still be more stuff throughout the year.

33:17.000 --> 33:19.000
Alright, that was my gaming week.

33:19.000 --> 33:21.000
So let's get into some news.

33:21.000 --> 33:23.000
Some quick housekeeping though, things to note.

33:24.000 --> 33:27.000
Next week we'll be back with episode 777.

33:27.000 --> 33:29.000
Dark Sakura will be here as well.

33:29.000 --> 33:35.000
And then that will be it for the month because the week after that, Memorial Day weekend, we will not be here.

33:35.000 --> 33:39.000
Dark Sakura is going to a drag queen convention in LA, yes really.

33:39.000 --> 33:44.000
And I'm going to Chicago for a big Ingress event and doing some other stuff out there too.

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
So seeing some friends and so forth.

33:46.000 --> 33:49.000
So Memorial Day weekend is just, everybody's going places.

33:49.000 --> 33:51.000
So we won't be here that weekend.

33:51.000 --> 33:57.000
But we will be back the week after that when, if I'm not mistaken, we have to kind of hit the ground running on E3, right?

33:57.000 --> 34:00.000
I think we might have one more show before all the E3 stuff starts.

34:00.000 --> 34:04.000
But yeah, we're going to be back from Memorial Day and really hitting the ground on E3.

34:04.000 --> 34:05.000
So it's going to be exciting.

34:05.000 --> 34:06.000
Yes.

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
Alright, we hope you'll join us.

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
Let's get into some gaming news.

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
So Loki, you want to start us off tonight?

34:12.000 --> 34:17.000
Sure, let's start off talking about what has been kind of a...

34:17.000 --> 34:19.000
Oh wait, sorry, this is worth noting.

34:19.000 --> 34:20.000
Sorry, because this did happen this week.

34:20.000 --> 34:24.000
SSU 100 Matt says, Rob is also coming to New York too.

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
That is true.

34:26.000 --> 34:29.000
I am finally planning my trip back to New York.

34:29.000 --> 34:33.000
And it's going to be over Veterans Day weekend in November.

34:33.000 --> 34:37.000
So it's a little ways off for me to start telling you there's no show that weekend.

34:37.000 --> 34:38.000
But here's what happened.

34:38.000 --> 34:43.000
I got tickets to see Jagged Little Pill on Broadway because they're turning that into a Broadway show.

34:43.000 --> 34:48.000
And my pal Aria Snark, Victoria from Shaking and Crying,

34:48.000 --> 34:55.000
it turned into, well, if we're going to go to New York and see one play, why don't we see three plays?

34:55.000 --> 35:02.000
But it's actually, it's kind of like, she's not going to go see Jagged Little Pill and they want to go see Frozen on Broadway.

35:02.000 --> 35:06.000
And I'm like, I don't really want to, but Victoria like dresses up and she, I mean, she looks great.

35:06.000 --> 35:07.000
She's really into it.

35:07.000 --> 35:11.000
So they're going to go see, when I say they, her and Melody are going to go see Frozen.

35:11.000 --> 35:17.000
And then we're all, all of us, myself, Alan, the girls, we're all going to go see Moulin Rouge is on Broadway.

35:17.000 --> 35:20.000
And I am fucking excited about that.

35:20.000 --> 35:23.000
Like that's going to be that, I mean, that, that was a hell of a movie.

35:23.000 --> 35:25.000
I can only imagine what a Broadway show that's going to be.

35:25.000 --> 35:26.000
So, yeah, yeah.

35:26.000 --> 35:31.000
So hopefully there will be a chance for me to say hello to listeners, meet up at Dave and Busters or something.

35:31.000 --> 35:33.000
But yes, finally come back to New York Veterans Day weekend.

35:33.000 --> 35:35.000
OK, I'm sorry. Now you can do the news.

35:35.000 --> 35:41.000
All right. Anyway, so it's been definitely something that's been in process for a while.

35:41.000 --> 35:46.000
We heard some senators complain about this a while back.

35:46.000 --> 35:52.000
I got like a long time ago about different microtransactions and stuff like that and loot boxes.

35:52.000 --> 35:56.000
I think actually when the whole Star Wars thing was going down, the Battlefront 2.

35:56.000 --> 36:12.000
So now apparently one of the senators of Missouri, Senator Josh Hawley, has announced a bill to ban loot boxes and pay to win microtransactions in games played by minors.

36:13.000 --> 36:18.000
So basically it's the Protecting Children from Abusive Games Act.

36:18.000 --> 36:25.000
And it's kind of targeting some of these games that have like egregious loot box.

36:25.000 --> 36:33.000
Like, for example, they're talking about Candy Crush, where it has like one hundred and fifty dollar loot box that you can buy, which is just ridiculous.

36:33.000 --> 36:39.000
So he said when a game is designed for kids, game developers shouldn't be allowed to monetize addiction.

36:39.000 --> 36:50.000
And when kids play the games designed for adults, they should be walled off from the compulsive microtransactions. Game developers who knowingly exploit children should face legal consequences.

36:52.000 --> 37:03.000
So the industry has failed to police itself in this regard, unlike what happened in the 90s when it came to the violence issue and the industry came up with the ESRB as a response.

37:03.000 --> 37:09.000
The industry has failed to respond to the loot box issue in a timely manner or with anything with significant substance.

37:09.000 --> 37:15.000
So now the government is getting involved. And, you know, although I think there's some of us that can say, oh, I'm not surprised it's coming.

37:15.000 --> 37:23.000
And I think there are some other people that could even be celebrating like, yay, the government is going to shut down this loot box thing and stop this predatory thing.

37:23.000 --> 37:31.000
Like, I get that. But I worry that if you're quick to jump to that conclusion, you're missing some things here that could actually be very bad about this.

37:31.000 --> 37:36.000
Because here's what I worry about. Tell me the name of that bill again.

37:36.000 --> 37:43.000
It is the Think of the Children Act. Protecting Children from Abusive Games Act.

37:43.000 --> 37:52.000
So Congress is going to invoke children on this whole thing and the games that are predatory on children. How is that going to be defined?

37:52.000 --> 37:58.000
Who's going to define that? Who is going to decide if a game targets children or not?

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
The ESRB ratings.

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
Is it? Because ESRB is not the government.

38:02.000 --> 38:03.000
True.

38:03.000 --> 38:13.000
So I worry that we're starting to walk down a path very similar to, what was it, ESRB versus Schwarzenegger or ESA versus, I think it was ESA versus Schwarzenegger.

38:13.000 --> 38:19.000
When, and what I'm referring to is that controversial law about the violent video game sales in California.

38:19.000 --> 38:26.000
So California at one point had banned the violent video games sales. Long story short, Supreme Court struck it down.

38:26.000 --> 38:33.000
Why did the Supreme Court strike it down? Because that line about what is a violent video game, they did not rely on the ESRB.

38:33.000 --> 38:36.000
They were relying on this like...

38:36.000 --> 38:39.000
But that's the problem. It was too broad. It didn't really define it.

38:39.000 --> 38:44.000
It was broad. It didn't define it. It left too much open to interpretation.

38:44.000 --> 38:52.000
And you know there are going to be some people that take this too far and use it as a way to kind of like shut down and lock down video games.

38:52.000 --> 38:57.000
So I'm not too quick to celebrate what's happening here.

38:57.000 --> 39:05.000
Did I kind of see this coming? Yes, I think we all did. Especially when the industry doubled down on this issue.

39:05.000 --> 39:11.000
And to be quite frank, I think the ESA has failed us here.

39:11.000 --> 39:17.000
And it's not surprising now that we're learning this week, and Bobby already talked about this at length.

39:17.000 --> 39:19.000
I don't know how we missed it for our show tonight.

39:19.000 --> 39:26.000
But you saw that there's like a lot of fuckery going on. Well, I should say there's an expose that's going on with the ESA.

39:26.000 --> 39:32.000
Variety Gaming did a whole little article about it that basically sounds like the...

39:32.000 --> 39:39.000
My interpretation of the article is that the leader of the ESA went off the deep end, apparently.

39:39.000 --> 39:45.000
Is not running a very strong organization. Is trying to inject too much politics into this whole thing.

39:45.000 --> 39:54.000
And is just like allowed this to go... And if y'all think you're not seeing the result of that, look at what's happened to E3, you guys.

39:54.000 --> 40:00.000
Anyway, Bobby's talked a lot about that at length tonight. I'm not going to... I'll tell y'all to listen to his show.

40:00.000 --> 40:09.000
But I do think there's a correlation here. I think where the ESA has kind of, for lack of a better term, started to fall up its own ass.

40:09.000 --> 40:12.000
Sorry, not sorry. Well, what else would you call it?

40:13.000 --> 40:18.000
Right. So the ESA has fallen up its own ass to the point where now this has been allowed to happen.

40:18.000 --> 40:25.000
And this is what pisses me off. The ESA, instead of trying to find a solution to this problem, tried to tell us there was no problem.

40:25.000 --> 40:33.000
And they still are, yeah. In fact, they put out a comment saying that numerous countries, including Ireland, Germany, Sweden, Denmark, Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom,

40:33.000 --> 40:36.000
determined that loot boxes do not constitute gambling.

40:37.000 --> 40:45.000
We look forward to sharing with the Senator the tools and information the industry already provides that keeps control of in-game spending in parents' hands.

40:45.000 --> 40:52.000
Parents already have the ability to limit or prohibit in-game purchases with ease using parental controls.

40:53.000 --> 41:03.000
Yeah, but I don't think, just because, I don't know. To me, that's almost like the argument of like,

41:03.000 --> 41:09.000
well, you had this bad thing happen to you because you did this.

41:09.000 --> 41:16.000
You could have avoided that whole situation if you didn't do something, but this happened to you because you didn't follow that.

41:17.000 --> 41:26.000
I don't know. I like how they don't mention Belgium because Belgium did conclude that they were gambling and they've had to take them out.

41:26.000 --> 41:43.000
And I don't know if any of these have said that these specifically are gambling or they just basically share the same types of symptoms of gambling addiction for people that are addicted to this kind of stuff.

41:43.000 --> 41:51.000
And I think, yeah, I think a lot of this isn't exactly gambling because if it was exactly gambling, then they would be held to gambling laws.

41:51.000 --> 42:01.000
So, of course, they're going to try to skirt that, but I think, I don't know, I think if they keep pushing it the way they're doing it, it's only going to get worse for them.

42:01.000 --> 42:09.000
So, I'm going to our chat for some more comments here. We see S.G.O. and Hunter Matt saying an awful lot about this at twitch.tv slash vog network.

42:09.000 --> 42:15.000
The senator is apparently very unpopular on the senate floor and because of that, it may fail when it goes to committee, so I've heard.

42:15.000 --> 42:20.000
The sports gaming community I follow are all cheering for this. I also don't see this as a good thing, correct?

42:20.000 --> 42:26.000
I think people are just looking at the bottom line where it's like, oh, the government's going to get rid of loot boxes. Yay!

42:26.000 --> 42:31.000
There was a senator in Hawaii that was supposed to be putting together a bill because he was like one of the first ones that kind of was...

42:31.000 --> 42:36.000
I believe the difference is that was a state senator. If I'm not mistaken, I could be wrong.

42:36.000 --> 42:42.000
Y'all can fact check me on this live if you want, but I believe that was a state senator in Hawaii looking at a state law.

42:42.000 --> 42:48.000
And now we're talking about a U.S. senator, so we're looking at a federal law. That's why this is back and it sounds like déjà vu.

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
That's why this is escalating more and more.

42:50.000 --> 42:54.000
And let's be honest here, I don't think that this is a big enough problem for them to even tackle.

42:54.000 --> 43:02.000
And if anything, the way the senate has been working nowadays, it's a corporation. They're going to protect the corporation, not the children.

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
Who gives a shit about the children in their opinion?

43:04.000 --> 43:09.000
That's kind of where SJ100Matt starts to go with it as EA continues to push it hardest in their sports games.

43:09.000 --> 43:16.000
Their ultimate team system, which is in NHL, Madden, FIFA, which is essentially a pay-to-win loot box system, brings in about $800 million a year to EA.

43:16.000 --> 43:21.000
EA is going to lobby as much as possible to make this bill not happen, to keep this revenue.

43:21.000 --> 43:24.000
So, how do we fix this problem, Loki?

43:24.000 --> 43:27.000
You can't. It'll never happen.

43:27.000 --> 43:32.000
Well, here's how it's going to happen. Stop spending $800 million on fucking microtransactions.

43:32.000 --> 43:35.000
That'll stop them from putting them in the games.

43:35.000 --> 43:38.000
But that's never going to happen, so you're fucked.

43:38.000 --> 43:42.000
So the people that are irritated enough by them don't buy those games.

43:42.000 --> 43:47.000
And the people that are happy with them, well, they're going to continue to buy those games no matter what you say.

43:47.000 --> 43:55.000
So, you're going to have to basically show them with your wallet what you want.

43:55.000 --> 44:01.000
Here's the problem, though. You take away one source of revenue, they're going to try to find that source of revenue somewhere else.

44:01.000 --> 44:06.000
It's going to happen. They feel that they need to get more money from you.

44:06.000 --> 44:15.000
That's why we have $60 games with microtransactions, with season passes, with DLC, with all this other crap that's thrown on top of it,

44:15.000 --> 44:22.000
you know, collector's editions and all this shit, is because they can get from you, instead of $60 for a game,

44:22.000 --> 44:27.000
they can get, like, several hundreds of dollars from you every single year.

44:27.000 --> 44:30.000
It's just not going to change until we change.

44:30.000 --> 44:32.000
Here's my idea on how to fix it.

44:32.000 --> 44:37.000
I'm going to propose something that, and maybe some of y'all aren't going to think it's going to be effective,

44:37.000 --> 44:40.000
but here's my suggestion on how we fix this whole thing.

44:40.000 --> 44:44.000
Number one, and by far the easiest thing you can do, and I think the thing that everybody agrees,

44:44.000 --> 44:47.000
there really isn't anything bad about this, so why not do it?

44:47.000 --> 44:50.000
And that would be to adopt what we're seeing already happen in other countries,

44:50.000 --> 44:55.000
where the distribution of what is in loot boxes is clear, transparent, and upfront.

44:55.000 --> 45:00.000
Meaning you have a 10% chance of getting this, you have a 5% chance of getting this, whatever it is.

45:00.000 --> 45:04.000
So the odds, that should always be transparent, easy to access, and upfront.

45:04.000 --> 45:10.000
Number one, that's the thing that, if you are a game company that doesn't want to fix that,

45:10.000 --> 45:13.000
and doesn't want to publish that, you are the fucking problem.

45:13.000 --> 45:15.000
Like, period.

45:15.000 --> 45:18.000
That needs to be fixed.

45:18.000 --> 45:22.000
Number two, if EA is not going to do fuck all about this,

45:22.000 --> 45:26.000
and the ESA, the people making the software are not going to do fuck all about this,

45:26.000 --> 45:29.000
here's my suggestion on who can fix this.

45:29.000 --> 45:32.000
There's three people that can fix this.

45:32.000 --> 45:36.000
Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo are the ones that can fix this.

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
How are they going to fix it?

45:38.000 --> 45:46.000
Because they're going to make it so that their hardware makes sure that they are doing the appropriate checks and balances

45:46.000 --> 45:52.000
to ensure from a hardware perspective that children are not spending this money unnecessarily,

45:52.000 --> 45:54.000
because it's about protecting the children, right?

45:54.000 --> 46:02.000
So, why aren't we picking on Apple and the mobile phone gaming industry and Google in this?

46:02.000 --> 46:06.000
Well, now that I think of it, children don't have money, so what money are they spending?

46:06.000 --> 46:08.000
They're spending their parents' money.

46:08.000 --> 46:10.000
So it's like your own fucking fault that you give your kids money.

46:10.000 --> 46:13.000
Right, so let's take that a step further, right?

46:13.000 --> 46:17.000
Because they say it's kids maybe unknowingly spending the parents' money.

46:17.000 --> 46:20.000
So here's why I invoke Apple and Google and all that.

46:20.000 --> 46:25.000
Because on Apple and Google, what does Apple keep selling as the new features of their phone?

46:25.000 --> 46:35.000
Security, face recognition, thumbprint, all these things to make sure that the person spending the money on the phone is you,

46:35.000 --> 46:41.000
and not somebody else in your family, a kid, or heaven forbid, your phone gets stolen, abandoned, abandoned, somebody else, right?

46:41.000 --> 46:42.000
Abandoned it.

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
Do you see where I'm going with this?

46:44.000 --> 46:48.000
This is what Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo need to do.

46:48.000 --> 46:53.000
Because if they don't fix the problem, it's going to affect them, because they get a cut of all these sales, right?

46:53.000 --> 47:03.000
They need to embed it within their own OSs to ensure that people that are spending the money are the person who is on the card.

47:03.000 --> 47:06.000
Now, I would say it's not so much children spending that is a problem.

47:06.000 --> 47:12.000
It's more people with addictive tendencies that are adults that have the problem.

47:12.000 --> 47:18.000
You know, and if they really wanted to impress the government and really take steps around that,

47:18.000 --> 47:22.000
they might make a note when you've spent so much money.

47:22.000 --> 47:29.000
A little display will come on the screen that says, you know, if you need help with a gambling addiction, call this number.

47:29.000 --> 47:32.000
They do that in Vegas. Look at those billboards on the lottery.

47:32.000 --> 47:35.000
What about this? What about like parental controls?

47:35.000 --> 47:41.000
What if we had an option, like a setting in the hardware where I can turn off microtransactions?

47:41.000 --> 47:46.000
So if I know I have a problem with spending money on that kind of crap,

47:46.000 --> 47:51.000
and I want to take, you know, preventative actions to avoid putting myself in that scenario,

47:51.000 --> 47:57.000
that I can toggle those off, and just like, you know, we don't want children getting access to them,

47:57.000 --> 48:00.000
it will shut off access to them so I don't see any references to it.

48:00.000 --> 48:03.000
I don't see anything that's tied to those microtransactions.

48:03.000 --> 48:05.000
I need to respond to this in chat.

48:05.000 --> 48:12.000
So Bobby in chat says, all things Samsung phones had years ago, by the way, Android for the win, Apple invented security.

48:12.000 --> 48:14.000
Respectfully, you're starting the wrong fight here.

48:14.000 --> 48:20.000
And the reason why is because the reason why I'm invoking Apple is because we know Apple puts on a show.

48:20.000 --> 48:23.000
Sure, Google, they all do these keynotes as well.

48:23.000 --> 48:24.000
But let's be real.

48:24.000 --> 48:32.000
Apple keynotes get covered by the media, and all that stuff gets super noticed in the mainstream and so forth.

48:32.000 --> 48:37.000
So that's kind of why I say that when Apple talks about security and all this stuff,

48:37.000 --> 48:45.000
there are generally people that are listening to the latest upgrades and so forth in security and how mobile phones and so forth.

48:45.000 --> 48:52.000
I fully realize Apple didn't invent all of this, and sometimes they're just running with a trend that they see in the industry.

48:52.000 --> 48:53.000
That's part of competition.

48:53.000 --> 48:56.000
But regardless, let's get back on what the real point is about it.

48:56.000 --> 49:04.000
I think that Nintendo, Microsoft, and Sony need to kind of look at what can they do to show that within their own systems,

49:04.000 --> 49:10.000
they are trying to protect money from not being spent unless it's the intended purchaser,

49:10.000 --> 49:12.000
basically making it harder for kids to spend money.

49:12.000 --> 49:16.000
And I know that might sound like it's shooting themselves in the foot because they kind of like it,

49:16.000 --> 49:19.000
because they make more money when kids are spending money and so forth.

49:19.000 --> 49:24.000
But they've got to realize, if this passes, this is going to be a whole lot worse for them.

49:24.000 --> 49:25.000
So what can they do?

49:25.000 --> 49:29.000
How about turning on parental controls by default?

49:29.000 --> 49:33.000
You have to set a passcode in order to be able to use your card.

49:33.000 --> 49:38.000
I think to some extent, honestly, they're kind of already doing this.

49:38.000 --> 49:43.000
I think they just need to maybe take it a step further to really show how,

49:43.000 --> 49:48.000
and maybe this is where I've got to invoke Apple and that showmanship, if you will.

49:48.000 --> 49:52.000
They've got to go out there and show how with these new systems that are coming out,

49:52.000 --> 50:00.000
this security is enabled by default and that they're making it so that only the person that is making the purchases

50:00.000 --> 50:03.000
is able to use the card.

50:03.000 --> 50:06.000
Because I think if they can do that, then the industry can say,

50:06.000 --> 50:12.000
that's how we're protecting kids because we've put in these security initiatives by default

50:12.000 --> 50:17.000
to ensure that a card purchaser or a card holder is the only one that's able to actually spend money on the account.

50:17.000 --> 50:22.000
And again, I want to stress, I do realize that Sony, you have to kind of put in a password.

50:22.000 --> 50:24.000
I don't know if that's always on by default.

50:24.000 --> 50:27.000
And a lot of times they kind of encourage you to save password and things like that, too.

50:27.000 --> 50:30.000
So I do think they need to communicate just a little more clearly.

50:30.000 --> 50:32.000
Well, they do a lot of two-factor all the time.

50:32.000 --> 50:34.000
Yeah, and two-factor is fine, too.

50:34.000 --> 50:37.000
And it's kind of to an annoying extent, but I understand why I have it.

50:37.000 --> 50:39.000
And that's my suggestion.

50:39.000 --> 50:43.000
And that's how loot boxes, I suppose, could stay in the industry.

50:43.000 --> 50:46.000
So again, number one, make the odds transparent.

50:46.000 --> 50:54.000
Number two, the systems need to up and the consoles need to enable on there by default

50:54.000 --> 51:02.000
that only the card holder is the one that can push the button and initiate the transaction to buy the loot box or whatever it is.

51:02.000 --> 51:08.000
And I think if they can show that, then that will be how they can say that kids can't spend money

51:08.000 --> 51:11.000
unless their parents told them the password, which you shouldn't do.

51:12.000 --> 51:15.000
So that's my thought.

51:15.000 --> 51:18.000
Do you think there might be anything to that? I don't know.

51:18.000 --> 51:19.000
I don't think they're going to do anything.

51:19.000 --> 51:23.000
I hope they do because I think if this passes, it's going to be a whole lot worse.

51:23.000 --> 51:29.000
But maybe they're just banking on, ah, it's not going to pass because just like the ESA versus Schwarzenegger thing

51:29.000 --> 51:33.000
and the violent thing being too vague, this protecting children thing is too vague.

51:33.000 --> 51:38.000
So we're just going to run out the clock because that's a popular trend in politics these days.

51:38.000 --> 51:43.000
We're just going to wait it out because we know politics is a slow process, so we're just going to run out the clock.

51:43.000 --> 51:44.000
Yep.

51:44.000 --> 51:47.000
I just think that's dangerous.

51:47.000 --> 51:51.000
Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, but Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo want their cut of the loot box prices.

51:51.000 --> 51:53.000
Remember, EA doesn't get 100%.

51:53.000 --> 51:57.000
Oh no, I full well recognize this, but I think those three companies have to ask a hard question.

51:57.000 --> 51:59.000
What's worse?

51:59.000 --> 52:02.000
What's going to impact the bottom line more?

52:02.000 --> 52:05.000
The security features I'm talking about or this bill?

52:05.000 --> 52:09.000
Because this bill is going to come if they continue to do nothing.

52:09.000 --> 52:13.000
It might take seven years, but it's going to come eventually.

52:13.000 --> 52:17.000
So anyway, I've talked a lot about that. Let's move on, shall we?

52:17.000 --> 52:18.000
Yes.

52:18.000 --> 52:19.000
Let's go to another story.

52:19.000 --> 52:22.000
So let's talk about another big thing that's going on in the industry this week.

52:22.000 --> 52:26.000
There was a big walkout that happened this week, and the walkout happened at Riot Games.

52:26.000 --> 52:31.000
And 150 employees this week walked out at Riot Games in their offices in Los Angeles.

52:32.000 --> 52:37.000
They were basically having a protest over recent discrimination lawsuits that were happening at Riot Games.

52:37.000 --> 52:40.000
Riot, of course, most well known for the game League of Legends.

52:40.000 --> 52:44.000
Funny that I was talking about Heroes of the Storm, because League of Legends is a game that's kind of like that.

52:44.000 --> 52:49.000
But it's the game that Riot puts out in response, or I guess really was first if you want to.

52:49.000 --> 52:52.000
But Dota was really the first. Anyway, forget it.

52:52.000 --> 52:58.000
So there was a big expose that Kotaku had done, gosh, when was it?

52:58.000 --> 53:05.000
It was last year, it was over the summer last year, about some sexism and some other things allegedly going on in the workplace.

53:05.000 --> 53:13.000
And some employees filed suit, and the publisher basically, Riot, wanted to force these to go to forced arbitration,

53:13.000 --> 53:21.000
because this is very popular in corporate culture, is to back out of the courts and make people go to arbitration.

53:21.000 --> 53:25.000
Arbitration clauses, right? You've probably heard of them, you see them all the time.

53:25.000 --> 53:30.000
So, in this employment world, it's no different in that regard.

53:30.000 --> 53:33.000
And these employees were signing up to work at this company.

53:33.000 --> 53:37.000
They probably had to sign some type of arbitration clause that is basically,

53:37.000 --> 53:41.000
any dispute won't be settled in court, it'll be settled in arbitration.

53:41.000 --> 53:48.000
Why do we always go to arbitration? Because usually arbitration tends to side a little more on the corporate side of things,

53:48.000 --> 53:54.000
because it is a private process as opposed to a public process, which would be the judicial system, right?

53:54.000 --> 53:58.000
So, that's why arbitration tends to do these things.

53:58.000 --> 54:04.000
But I think it's pretty notable that you have a bunch of employees that stood up, walked out, and said, fuck that, basically.

54:04.000 --> 54:10.000
Because I think why this is noteworthy, it's not just about dogging on Riot Games and the continued issues,

54:10.000 --> 54:15.000
but this ties into, I think, some of these bigger things we've been talking about in the industry and what's been going on for a while,

54:15.000 --> 54:19.000
between the crunch time and other things that are a problem in the industry.

54:19.000 --> 54:27.000
This is the first sign you've had of people coming together and banding up for a common purpose,

54:27.000 --> 54:32.000
and taking, it's very similar to what might happen if the industry were to unionize.

54:32.000 --> 54:38.000
So, in some ways, this was a big step, maybe, in that direction.

54:38.000 --> 54:45.000
I know I'm using a lot of vague language there, but I know the word union also scares some people, so we don't know.

54:45.000 --> 54:53.000
But regardless, we're seeing a lot of workers in the gaming industry kind of band together and stick up for themselves.

54:53.000 --> 54:56.000
So, it could be very interesting to see where this goes from here.

54:56.000 --> 55:01.000
What did you think watching this whole thing? I'm curious, at the chat as well, what did you guys think?

55:01.000 --> 55:11.000
Well, I had watched some videos that were covering the story, and they were talking about how just the corporate,

55:11.000 --> 55:24.000
just the way that they kind of interact, the words, just the way the normal interactions was very misogynistic, I guess,

55:24.000 --> 55:29.000
from what I hear, that there's a lot of sexist comments coming from some of the execs.

55:29.000 --> 55:37.000
That's kind of what prompted some of these lawsuits, but because there's arbitration stuff that they had,

55:37.000 --> 55:46.000
they were being forced to, they felt like they couldn't be heard by anyone in power to actually take action on that stuff.

55:46.000 --> 55:50.000
That's a very good point, because when it's arbitrated, it's all behind closed doors.

55:50.000 --> 55:56.000
When it's judicial, it's a matter of public record. That's a very good clarification between the two processes.

55:56.000 --> 55:59.000
And on that note, I do want to read, because Bobby's doing a little...

55:59.000 --> 56:01.000
Corporate culture. That's what I wanted. Culture.

56:01.000 --> 56:04.000
Bobby's doing a little fact-checking in real time in chat, and this is fine.

56:04.000 --> 56:07.000
I don't mind being told. It's a little different. Bobby says,

56:07.000 --> 56:15.000
The walkout is because Riot is not forcing new employees into arbitration, but they're keeping all existing employees on the forced arbitration clause.

56:15.000 --> 56:20.000
So, new employees can go to court. Existing employees can only go to arbitration.

56:20.000 --> 56:27.000
Well, certainly, there's a disconnect there. Maybe Riot was trying to clean things up a little bit after the Kotaku thing came out,

56:27.000 --> 56:30.000
so they kind of changed some of their rules.

56:30.000 --> 56:34.000
But I think it makes sense that if you do something that favors new employees,

56:34.000 --> 56:40.000
then the employees that were already there should be included on that plan, right?

56:40.000 --> 56:44.000
Like, if you're going to give new employees more PTO, usually you bump everybody else up.

56:44.000 --> 56:49.000
Aren't they just worried that if they did drop that clause, that all of a sudden, they're going to get lots of lawsuits?

56:49.000 --> 56:50.000
Is that the word?

56:50.000 --> 56:56.000
I don't know. I don't know if we fully know the answer to that, but there's certainly a reason for it.

56:56.000 --> 57:03.000
Anyway, now, Riot Games is saying, you know, they tried to kind of play this whole thing cool.

57:03.000 --> 57:06.000
You kind of wonder if there's sweat and bullets behind the scene or what's going on.

57:06.000 --> 57:10.000
But Riot did say, they put out a statement, they said, and they commented to Variety,

57:10.000 --> 57:13.000
they said, We support Rioters making their voices heard today.

57:13.000 --> 57:19.000
We've asked all managers to make every commendation to allow Rioters to participate, including freeing up meeting times.

57:19.000 --> 57:24.000
We respect Rioters who choose to walk out today and will not tolerate retaliation of any kind

57:24.000 --> 57:29.000
as a result of participating. So, I mean, they've been dragged through the mud publicly once already.

57:29.000 --> 57:35.000
They're going out of their way to be like, Oh, yeah, it's cool. You're going to walk off your jobs.

57:35.000 --> 57:39.000
It's cool. It's cool. Yeah, you know, maybe we deserved it a little bit. I don't know.

57:39.000 --> 57:47.000
So, they're very much trying to at least outwardly give that impression of, Oh, you know, we're cool.

57:47.000 --> 57:51.000
We don't, you know, please don't write another mean thing about us and keep playing League of Legends, right?

57:51.000 --> 57:52.000
Yeah.

57:52.000 --> 57:56.000
I mean, time will tell if this is to have impact.

57:56.000 --> 58:02.000
But certainly, the employees that walked out have kind of threatened that they're going to do more if things don't change.

58:02.000 --> 58:07.000
So, if this arbitration clause doesn't go away in favor of the judicial process and so forth,

58:07.000 --> 58:13.000
of course, they're not saying what it is because maybe they don't want Riot to be able to prepare a statement next time.

58:13.000 --> 58:15.000
And that could be a variety of things.

58:15.000 --> 58:18.000
You could talk about, you know, and again, I'm making shit up.

58:18.000 --> 58:21.000
I don't know anything about what's going on behind closed doors at Riot.

58:21.000 --> 58:23.000
I'm completely making shit up.

58:23.000 --> 58:27.000
They could walk out again but not warn people when it's going to happen.

58:27.000 --> 58:29.000
And they could time this around an important deadline.

58:29.000 --> 58:31.000
They could do something timed with E3.

58:31.000 --> 58:35.000
There could be a convenient breaking of some major NDAs.

58:35.000 --> 58:37.000
We don't know.

58:37.000 --> 58:40.000
There could be a leak.

58:40.000 --> 58:45.000
Around my E3? I don't believe that.

58:45.000 --> 58:51.000
I mean, again, I'm just making shit up but these are the types of things that could happen potentially.

58:51.000 --> 58:55.000
So, if you wanted to damage a company, that might be a way to do it.

58:55.000 --> 58:56.000
Spill all their secrets.

58:56.000 --> 58:58.000
Leak all their secrets.

58:58.000 --> 59:05.000
And make it so that, you know, I'm sure there are lots of gaming websites out there that would promise anonymity for some of those secrets.

59:05.000 --> 59:08.000
Of course, then they might get taken to court but you got the First Amendment.

59:08.000 --> 59:09.000
It would get ugly.

59:09.000 --> 59:21.000
Anyway, I'm not saying they should do that but it's going to be interesting to see how this might escalate if Riot doesn't, you know, listen to some of these demands.

59:21.000 --> 59:23.000
And it may not end there.

59:23.000 --> 59:34.000
If this campaign is successful, perhaps we're going to see employees start to stand up for things like crunch time and for things like benefits and so on and so forth.

59:34.000 --> 59:39.000
So, we're at a very interesting sort of turning point, I think, in the industry.

59:39.000 --> 59:41.000
It could be very, very interesting.

59:41.000 --> 59:51.000
So, SSTO100Matt says the industry needs to unionize and don't believe the nonsense about saving enough money on union dues to buy a game console like what Delta did this week.

59:51.000 --> 59:53.000
Oh yeah, that was a whole thing. Did you see that?

59:53.000 --> 59:54.000
No.

59:54.000 --> 01:00:01.000
Delta was putting out these ads. They're all over Twitter about the $700 you spend annually in union fees could go to buy a new game console and all these games.

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:09.000
There's a variety of different little ads that show what $700 could buy you and just the game console one is the one that's catching a lot of gamer's attention, obviously.

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000
So, yeah, interesting.

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:17.000
SSTO100Matt also says happy employees respect their companies.

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:18.000
Just saying.

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000
And isn't that the truth?

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:23.000
I think we'll end it on that note and we'll move on to our next story.

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.000
So, let's go to something a little more positive.

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:26.000
Yeah, Loki?

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:27.000
Yes.

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:28.000
So, this is pretty cool.

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000
Did you know that Minecraft is 10 years old?

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.000
So, that's right. They're celebrating.

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:45.000
Don't you feel old as a result because that's why every time I see one of those things on Facebook that says XYZ is 20 years old today or, you know, God, what was the thing that was just recently going around is like 30 years old as of today.

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:48.000
I don't know, but it's just like, wow, I feel old.

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:51.000
Yeah, I'm trying to remember.

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:52.000
But anyways, yeah.

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000
So, it is 10 years old.

01:00:54.000 --> 01:01:01.000
And to celebrate, they have a brand new map that you can play that's basically celebrating the whole history of Minecraft.

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:08.000
They even have this large Minecraft minecart ride that kind of walks you through all the different things.

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:13.000
They have like this giant compendium of all the blocks and how to use them and all the mobs.

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:19.000
And aside from it being quite impressive to look at, there's also some Easter eggs in there and you can go check that out.

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:25.000
Basically, any version of Minecraft that's available out there, I think you can actually play this on right now.

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:29.000
So, that's still currently being updated, of course.

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000
I don't think 360 is going to be able to do that.

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.000
Some interesting comments from chat.

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:37.000
S2100Matt says, Minecraft is now eligible for Classic Game of the Week.

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000
Fuck. I guess it is.

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:40.000
I guess it is, yeah.

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:41.000
Stay tuned.

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:47.000
I don't know if it'll come up on Jamie's radar, but we have had guests picking games lately and I don't believe Minecraft is on the ban list.

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000
Why would it be on the ban list?

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:51.000
I don't think it is.

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:56.000
BobbyBlackWolf wonders in their 10th anniversary post, do they mention Notch?

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:59.000
Because I don't know if you know, but he's kind of messy.

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:06.000
I don't know, but part of the map is all of the little phrases that were in Minecraft.

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:11.000
Like when you start it up, how there's little catch tag lines or whatever that are on there.

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.000
So, they have the whole map surrounded by those.

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:17.000
So, I don't know if it mentions Notch in any of those.

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:18.000
I would guess no.

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:23.000
I'm going to guess that a company kind of knows when something is much bigger than one person.

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:26.000
And I think Minecraft is far past that point.

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:30.000
Where, you know, don't cry for that guy.

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:31.000
Because how much money did he get?

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:32.000
Yeah.

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:33.000
Yeah.

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.000
So, we're not going to shed any tears for that.

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:38.000
So, yeah, right now it's free to anyone that has the Bedrock versions of the game.

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:44.000
So, that includes Xbox One, Switch, PC, and mobile devices.

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:48.000
No PlayStation 4 apparently.

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.000
And then, what else?

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:57.000
And then, they also have it available for the Java versions in Realms.

01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:03.000
I know I saw on the, because this actually, this map was created by somebody that does a lot of map creation.

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:08.000
And so, they had it tagged where you can download the maps to play it in the Java version.

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000
So, but it's out there.

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:11.000
I'm sure if you go to the Minecraft site.

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:15.000
On top of that though, they have this now classic version of Minecraft.

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:18.000
So, the very first version of Minecraft is out there.

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:21.000
Like, prior to a lot of the features that you come to love in there.

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.000
Like, for example, there's no mobs.

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000
You only have eight types of blocks.

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.000
It's only in creative mode.

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.000
So, they have that.

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:34.000
So, apparently, you can play that in your browser now.

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:44.000
So, you can actually go check it out at minecraft.net slash en dash us article.

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:48.000
And then, embrace dash past dash minecraft dash past.

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:49.000
I can't write that fast.

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000
Just go to minecraft.net.

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:52.000
I'm sure they've got a link.

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:53.000
I think that'll work.

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:54.000
Yes.

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:55.000
Or Google it.

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:56.000
Yes, or Google it.

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:59.000
You can check it out and play it.

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:03.000
I see more than eight blocks there.

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:04.000
I don't know about that.

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000
But, it's neat.

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:09.000
Okay, but 4K Super Graphics Pack win.

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:12.000
Sonic Ether was working on it.

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:13.000
Sort of.

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:19.000
But, unfortunately, he stopped sharing stuff like the beta versions.

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.000
They quietly stopped talking about that.

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:22.000
Yeah, maybe.

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:23.000
Maybe E3.

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.000
Well, just like the last time they talked about it.

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:30.000
Well, actually, didn't they announce something coming up on the 17th?

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:31.000
Was it?

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:34.000
Didn't they announce like they put something out like a teaser with a date on it?

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:38.000
Because I thought I saw something in our Discord over at vognetwork.com slash Discord about it.

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:39.000
Like, they were teasing a date.

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.000
Somebody had posted about that.

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:45.000
So, I don't know if maybe there are more announcements to come or what have you.

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:48.000
Is that when their next like inside Xbox is going to be?

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:49.000
I don't think it's inside Xbox.

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.000
I think it's a Minecraft focus thing.

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:52.000
Inside Minecraft?

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000
No, I think it's just a Minecraft.

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000
Because don't they do like Minecon and that kind of stuff?

01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:00.000
Minecon was already happened.

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.000
That was in April.

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.000
But, yeah.

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.000
I mean, I haven't played Minecraft in a while.

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:09.000
I know they have new mobs and everything since I played Minecraft.

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:12.000
So, we need to go back and play again.

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000
I know. I know you miss Minecraft.

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000
Actually, I wanted to go dig it up.

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000
So, that's why I'm looking at my phone right now.

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:23.000
I'm actually going onto the Discord to find what that was that was being shared.

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:24.000
And, yeah.

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:28.000
Okay. So, it was posted by 13X Forever in our Discord on Monday saying,

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:33.000
Minecraft AR teased at the end of today's Microsoft Build Conference keynote.

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.000
So, May 17th.

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:38.000
And they show like a little like they're holding the phone.

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000
So, there may be more information.

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:41.000
I guess that wouldn't be the full day.

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:42.000
I wonder if they're going to.

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:49.000
I mean, maybe they're pushing that to the Windows reality.

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000
Do those have the passthrough cameras on it?

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000
I know like some of them have the passthrough cameras on them.

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.000
I don't know if the mixed reality headsets.

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:59.000
I would assume mixed reality means that maybe they do.

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.000
It would be neat if it was coming like phones.

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000
Like you do AR like building with that.

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:06.000
Yeah, Minecraft Go says Act Deft with a question mark.

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:10.000
So, like a Minecraft type of real world type game.

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:11.000
That could be very interesting.

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:12.000
We'll see.

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.000
I guess we'll find out this coming week.

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:15.000
It's possible.

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:16.000
I'd play it.

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:17.000
Yeah. We'll see.

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.000
All right. Anyhow, moving on.

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.000
Another game that I know a lot of people are very excited about.

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:22.000
Tetris 99.

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:23.000
That's still a thing.

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:28.000
And I think many people kind of foresaw when Tetris 99 first came out.

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:29.000
People kind of foresaw.

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:32.000
You know, excuse me.

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:36.000
You know, there seems to be room in this for there to be more than just the Battle Royale.

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:37.000
That there's room.

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:40.000
And sure enough, it's been announced there is more coming.

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.000
It's the Big Block DLC.

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:47.000
And it will be offline modes for Tetris 99 for $9.99.

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:48.000
So, here's the thing.

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:52.000
Tetris 99 right now is free if you have the Switch Online, right?

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:53.000
So, it's kind of like a free game.

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:57.000
But, I mean, it would only work online anyway if you had the Nintendo Switch Online.

01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:00.000
So, now they're going to be selling a version of it, basically.

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:04.000
Or this DLC, if you will, for $10 that will allow you to do offline.

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:07.000
So, it will include CPU battle.

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:10.000
You versus 98 computer players.

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:15.000
Which would be good if you want to play on the go on an airplane or somewhere where you don't have internet.

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:18.000
Or if you just don't like playing with people online.

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.000
Although, you don't really interact with people online.

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.000
They feel like computer players.

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:23.000
You don't really interact with them.

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:24.000
But, whatever.

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:28.000
I mean, you can play this game when you're not buying internet.

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:29.000
That's, you know, something that would happen.

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.000
Also, though, there's more.

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:35.000
Marathon, which would involve clearing the most lines and scoring big.

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:38.000
And you don't need an internet connection for either one.

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:39.000
So, yeah.

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:44.000
And then I think they were talking about some type of upcoming mode or tournament or something where...

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:45.000
Yeah, here it is.

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:51.000
The maximum cup event from May 17th at midnight to May 19th at 11.59 PM.

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:56.000
If you get 100 points, you get a special Game Boy theme that looks like the old Game Boy Tetris game.

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:57.000
Which is kind of cute.

01:07:57.000 --> 01:08:01.000
So, I wish you could just get that for playing.

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.000
I wish you didn't have to score a ton of points to do it.

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:04.000
But maybe that won't be too hard.

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:05.000
I don't know.

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:06.000
I want to check out that Game Boy theme, though.

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:07.000
That looks pretty cool.

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:10.000
So, I know a lot of you are enjoying Tetris 99.

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:13.000
And you got some more stuff to look forward to there.

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.000
So, Bobby Blackwolf points out,

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000
Computer players aren't as good as human players.

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.000
I can actually win in single player.

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:21.000
ActDef says,

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:24.000
People are hating on the big block DLC and I really don't understand why.

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.000
Probably the $10 charge.

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:27.000
People are probably like,

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:28.000
But the game was free.

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:29.000
Why am I paying to...

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:30.000
Probably, I think that's...

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:31.000
You don't have to.

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:32.000
It's optional.

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:33.000
It is optional.

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:34.000
You don't have to pay it.

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:35.000
So,

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:36.000
Dr. Studio says,

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:37.000
I did eventually get to 100.

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.000
So, I don't think the Game Boy skin will be that hard to unlock.

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:40.000
Well, that's good to know.

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:41.000
That'll be good.

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:42.000
Anyhow, let's move on.

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:45.000
Just a couple more stories for you guys before we get to the Classic Game of the Week.

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:46.000
Loki.

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.000
So, they've announced the E3 press conference schedule.

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:51.000
So, we can take a look and see what we're going to be up against.

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000
Starting June 9th.

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.000
So, June 9th, of course, being a Sunday.

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:59.000
We've got Microsoft at 1 p.m. Pacific time.

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:04.000
And followed by Bethesda at Sunday at 9...

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.000
5.30.

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:10.000
Then the following day on that Monday, June 10th.

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.000
We've got Ubisoft at 1.

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:18.000
And later on the evening, Square Enix at 6 p.m. Pacific time.

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:22.000
Followed by Nintendo doing their direct at...

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:25.000
On June 11th, 9 a.m. Pacific time.

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:27.000
So, I'm looking at the calendar here.

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:28.000
That's why I'm looking at my phone.

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:29.000
I'm looking at a calendar.

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.000
And so, next week is episode 777.

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.000
We're off on May 26th.

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:34.000
Okay, that's the week we're off.

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.000
We come back June 2nd.

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:37.000
So, that's kind of the ramp into E3.

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:39.000
It's kind of the last show before E3.

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:40.000
And when the rumors are really going to start to...

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:43.000
And you might start to hear some indie news and so forth.

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000
And then June 9th is right after that.

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:47.000
So, 779 will be the E3 show.

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:51.000
Because Bethesda is going to interrupt our show again.

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:53.000
With whatever they've got going.

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.000
Which we kind of don't know.

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:59.000
Because that star field probably isn't ready, right?

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:00.000
So, we don't...

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:03.000
That's never stopped them from releasing something.

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:04.000
Fair.

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.000
Be very curious to see what they're going to talk about.

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.000
And then since Sony isn't doing anything Monday night...

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:13.000
Oh, I think it's about time for like a Fallout New Vegas remaster or something like that.

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:14.000
Wait a minute.

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.000
So, Square Enix is doing their own thing Monday night, right?

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:17.000
Instead of Sony, right?

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:18.000
Yes.

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:20.000
So, we're very likely to see some things on the Final Fantasy VII remake.

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:22.000
Which I'm about to touch on here as well.

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:26.000
Do you think maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe?

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:28.000
We're going to see Final Fantasy XVI.

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.000
It's time. It's time. It's time.

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.000
Final Fantasy XVI. It's time. It's time.

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.000
We've moved on from XV, right?

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.000
We're done.

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.000
Final Fantasy XVI. It's time, yeah?

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:39.000
It's time.

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.000
For Urgance 2.

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:42.000
No?

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:43.000
Alright.

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:44.000
Well, I guess that does go...

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.000
Come on. Think of the esports.

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.000
Urgance 2. Come on.

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:54.000
I guess that does go right into another story here about Final Fantasy VII and the Final Fantasy VII remake.

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:59.000
And sure enough, this week, Sony PlayStation did a State of Play update.

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:02.000
Which is PlayStation Direct, essentially, under a different name.

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.000
And they showed a few things there.

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.000
Some of the stuff is sprinkled throughout our show a little later.

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:11.000
But also, the fact that we got an update on the Final Fantasy VII remake.

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.000
We got a little bit more of a trailer.

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:16.000
Which showed some gameplay and it showed some cinematics.

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:20.000
Probably, you know, some scenes we got to kind of see in the remake style.

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:25.000
Such as that first scene where Aerith runs into Cloud and offers him the flower.

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.000
Which was, you know, that's seen in the original game.

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:30.000
And you see that a little more fully realized.

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:34.000
And they did tease that there would be more coming in June.

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:39.000
Well, now we know they have their own press conference coming up instead of Sony.

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:43.000
It would seem very likely that that would be the time that we're going to get more information.

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:44.000
Gameplay!

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:47.000
Well, I mean, the trailer has gameplay in it.

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:48.000
Like actual gameplay.

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:51.000
Maybe, yeah. Now, maybe instead of it being so sliced up.

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:53.000
Gameplay demo, huh?

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.000
Maybe. Maybe we'll see something like that.

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:56.000
Maybe.

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:57.000
That could very well be a thing.

01:11:57.000 --> 01:12:01.000
It should be noted, though, on the same token there with Final Fantasy VII.

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:04.000
They are still planning to make the remake episodic.

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:06.000
And you may have noticed, even in that trailer.

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:10.000
It seemed like everything in that trailer was the first hour of the game, if that.

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:11.000
I mean, there wasn't.

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:12.000
That's probably all they have done.

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:14.000
I don't know. I would hope they have more.

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:16.000
Maybe they're just holding some of that back for E3.

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:19.000
We don't know where the episode lines are being drawn.

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:22.000
But we do know that Final Fantasy VII still plans to be episodic.

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.000
It's each of the discs. Why not?

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:27.000
Well, but disc three was nothing but the last dungeon in the ending.

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:28.000
I don't think...

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:29.000
That's it, yeah.

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:30.000
I don't think they're going to draw the lines.

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:31.000
Haha, Sucker, you bought it for 60 bucks.

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:33.000
I don't think they're going to draw the lines what they did on the disc.

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:37.000
I think it's very logical that the whole sequence with getting out of Midgar.

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:38.000
That'll be episode one.

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:40.000
Maybe it goes into Advent Children.

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:44.000
I don't know. I think y'all are just adding your own shit to it.

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:48.000
I think where Midgar is, that'll be the end of the first episode.

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:51.000
And then kind of in the overworld up to a certain...

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:52.000
I'm trying to remember back in the game.

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:55.000
But they'll probably split the overworld into like two and three.

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.000
I would imagine there's three episodes, but who knows?

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:58.000
There might be more.

01:12:58.000 --> 01:12:59.000
But here's something.

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:02.000
I mean, since they are splitting it up into episodic content,

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:04.000
you can expect you're going to pay 60 bucks for each episode.

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:08.000
So for the full Final Fantasy VII remake experience,

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:10.000
get ready to pay $180.

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:11.000
I would say at least.

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:12.000
Or just wait.

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:13.000
I would guess.

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:18.000
Now, this also begs an interesting question here, if you ask me.

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:23.000
We're already talking about the PlayStation 5 in 2020.

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:27.000
And we've already talked about how some games may just kind of come out

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:31.000
for PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5, right?

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:35.000
Isn't that going to be interesting if they get the Final Fantasy VII remake

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:38.000
Episode 1 out for PlayStation 4?

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:44.000
Then they put it out again on PlayStation 5 just before Episode 2 comes out.

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:47.000
That's how they're going to get $60 from you twice for the same episode.

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.000
Watch. Watch.

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:53.000
Of course, we also know the PlayStation 5 will play PlayStation 4 games,

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:55.000
so you won't necessarily have to do that.

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:58.000
But I bet there's some people that will for whatever, you know,

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:00.000
graphical upgrades and other things they might do with it as well.

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:01.000
We'll see.

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:05.000
I was going to mention, though, on top of that,

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:09.000
Devolver is also doing their press conference,

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:12.000
which will be fucking weird as usual.

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:14.000
But I love it.

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:16.000
Bobby Blackwolf is wondering,

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:19.000
will we get Final Fantasy VII Episode 3, though?

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:21.000
We're still waiting on Half-Life 2 Episode 3.

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:25.000
Well, the good news is we know Square can get a series to 15.

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:26.000
Right?

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:29.000
Square doesn't stumble on Half-Life 2.

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:33.000
Square doesn't stumble on the number 3, unlike some companies,

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:36.000
because they've at least got one of their franchises up to 15 games

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:38.000
and countless spin-offs.

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:41.000
So I think we're doing okay right there.

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:44.000
Akdev says, we will get Final Fantasy VII Episode 3,

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:46.000
but people will hate it and it will be patched,

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:49.000
like Episode 13 and Final Fantasy XV.

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:52.000
Oh, my God. All these numbers. I'm going crazy.

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:54.000
You know, it's probably going to be there, and I hope it is.

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:58.000
It actually is our Avengers game, remember?

01:14:58.000 --> 01:14:59.000
Oh, yeah.

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:00.000
They're supposed to be working on one of those.

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:02.000
Sure. I'd like to see that as well.

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:05.000
We'll talk some more E3 predictions in a couple weeks,

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.000
but it's getting exciting.

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:10.000
I've got to say, with as much as I'm kind of giving this Final Fantasy VII

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:11.000
and the episode thing,

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:14.000
and look at all this money you're going to spend, some crap.

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:16.000
I've got to say, it looks really good.

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:21.000
If it looks that good for some hours and hours of gameplay,

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:23.000
it kind of might be worth it.

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:26.000
That $180 will be spread out through five years.

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:30.000
I just hope this doesn't cease development on another Final Fantasy game,

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:32.000
because I know there's some of you out there that are like,

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:35.000
oh, no, the Final Fantasy VII remake is Final Fantasy XVI.

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:39.000
Maybe not in name, but all the resources that would be going to make

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.000
a Final Fantasy XVI are going to that remake right now,

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.000
so you're going to wait twice as long for a Final Fantasy XVI.

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:47.000
I hope we see a Final Fantasy VI remake in the same type of style.

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:52.000
All right. We need to go back to a simpler time.

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:57.000
We need to take a trip back to a time when there were not episodic remakes.

01:15:57.000 --> 01:16:02.000
There were not Episode VI and Final Fantasy X, II, and all this stuff,

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:05.000
but there were generations and generations and generations

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:06.000
of maybe different games.

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:10.000
We're going to take a trip back with the classic game of the week,

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:12.000
and then we'll be back here live in studio.

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:17.000
And so we'll take a step back through space and time

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:20.000
and this little segment that we do here on Orange Launch Radio

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:23.000
called the Classic Game of the Week, where usually,

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:26.000
Dark Soccer steps into the gaming vault and finds a game that she thinks,

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:28.000
hey, you guys should be checking out this game this week.

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:31.000
But as I mentioned earlier in the show, she's not here tonight

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:33.000
because she's off doing things for Mother's Day.

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:36.000
So as we've been doing this year, we're inviting some special guests

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:38.000
onto the show to take care of the Classic Game of the Week,

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:39.000
and this week is no different.

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:41.000
Welcome back to Orange Launch Radio.

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:44.000
Now, all the way from Boise, Idaho,

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:47.000
the one-time host of the Ranger Bride Podcast, Shane.

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:49.000
Hello.

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:51.000
Hello, welcome back.

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:52.000
Thank you.

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:55.000
It has been a little while since we've had you on the show.

01:16:55.000 --> 01:17:00.000
Can you summarize the past couple years in one or two sentences?

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:10.000
I got married, I moved, and I quit paying attention to Power Rangers.

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:11.000
Okay.

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:14.000
That sounds like a lot of big changes going on.

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:18.000
Well, glad to have you here on the show to help us out with this segment,

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:20.000
the Classic Game of the Week.

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:21.000
So why don't we get to it?

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:24.000
What did you pick for our listeners tonight?

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:25.000
Okay.

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:29.000
Well, what I picked is very relevant at the moment

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:34.000
because there's this little indie movie that just came out.

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:37.000
It's called Detective Pikachu.

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:41.000
And I'm sure we have not yet talked about it tonight at all.

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:44.000
No, not one bit.

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:46.000
And while I can't actually...

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:49.000
There's a Detective Pikachu game that you guys didn't know,

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:53.000
but it doesn't meet the requirements for Classic Game of the Week.

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:54.000
Yes.

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:56.000
We do have strict rules around here.

01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:58.000
I don't write them, but I do have to enforce them.

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:03.000
So I am taking an aspect of that movie

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:07.000
and an aspect of a story that I totally have to tell

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:09.000
and combining it.

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:14.000
And it's going to give our Classic Game of the Week

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:18.000
the big reveal, Pokemon Diamond and Pearl.

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:19.000
All right.

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:23.000
And what's kind of interesting about this week on Twitch anyway,

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:24.000
you don't really see this on the podcast,

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:27.000
but we actually show footage from the game in the background

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:29.000
of the game that's been picked.

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:33.000
And usually we just kind of have like a random let's play from YouTube or something.

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:36.000
But tonight, this is actual footage that you shot

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:37.000
playing the game.

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:38.000
Yep.

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:41.000
I have a DS that is modded.

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:43.000
Sorry, a 3DS that is modded.

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:46.000
2DS that is modded because it's my Pokemon one.

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:50.000
And I thought I really haven't used it yet.

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:52.000
And if we're going to be doing a Pokemon game,

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:54.000
of which I own all of them,

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:58.000
we might as well just go ahead and use footage that I get.

01:18:58.000 --> 01:18:59.000
Awesome.

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:02.000
Well, I'm glad that we get to have some unique footage

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:04.000
here on the show tonight of the Classic Game.

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:05.000
So tell us a little bit about-

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:12.000
There may be a special guest star or two in that footage.

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:13.000
All right.

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:15.000
For those that are on Twitch anyway, we'll keep our eyes peeled.

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:17.000
But why this game?

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:19.000
Out of the seven generations of Pokemon games,

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:21.000
well, I know some of them aren't eligible because they're not 10 years old,

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:22.000
but there's been-

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:24.000
I know like the one I want to do.

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:25.000
I know there's been-

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:26.000
One more year and I can do it.

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:29.000
I know there's been spinoffs and a variety of things.

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:32.000
So why are we bringing this one to the table tonight?

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:35.000
Okay, so there's two reasons.

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:38.000
The first reason is in Detective Pikachu,

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:45.000
all different types of Pokemon are represented from different generations.

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:50.000
And I was going through the list on a website that kind of cataloged

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:51.000
which ones show up,

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:59.000
and I noticed that there was one generation four Pokemon in the entire movie,

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:01.000
which still made me feel a little bad.

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:03.000
That doesn't count like posters.

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:06.000
It doesn't count statues in the movie.

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:10.000
I'm talking about physical Pokemon that you can interact with in the movie.

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:13.000
And so I was like, well, I get it.

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:18.000
Gen four is not the best, but let's do something nice for Gen four today.

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:23.000
The second reason is, and I'm not sure if you remember this, Rob,

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:28.000
but around the time this game came out, which was April,

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:34.000
I'm scrolling up because I don't remember the exact day, April 22nd, 2007,

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:40.000
around that time, you, myself, and Jamie took a trip to Disneyland,

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:43.000
and one of the things we did was we stopped at a Walmart

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:46.000
and I bought Pokemon Diamond on that trip.

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:48.000
I do vaguely remember that.

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:51.000
Those were the years where we were going to Disneyland all the time

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:52.000
because it was reasonably priced.

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:57.000
It was like $25 million for a half-day pass.

01:20:57.000 --> 01:21:00.000
Exactly. I do remember this because this was, you know,

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:04.000
I don't think you were at the point where you were buying five copies of every generation,

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:07.000
but you were definitely still like, I got to get this game.

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:11.000
Yeah, I wasn't even getting both copies at that point.

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:14.000
I was just picking one and going with it.

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:18.000
So, boy, those were the easy days.

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:21.000
So you kind of referenced something there, though,

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:27.000
about that this maybe isn't necessarily the best Pokemon game in some people's eyes.

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:30.000
Like, this generation is kind of controversial, right?

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:36.000
Yeah, it's got a few interesting choices that were made, at least in Diamond and Pearl.

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:40.000
That's why I wanted to go with Diamond and Pearl versus Platinum,

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:42.000
which would have also qualified for today.

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:48.000
But Platinum was your third version in Generation 4's main games,

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:55.000
and whenever you get a third version, it usually fixes a lot of problems that the previous games had.

01:21:55.000 --> 01:22:04.000
So, for example, in Diamond and Pearl, there are all of four different types of Pokemon

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:09.000
that you can get throughout the game that have a fire typing,

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:13.000
either solid or is double-typed and one of them is fire.

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:21.000
Just to make that even worse is that one of those Pokemon that you can get is exclusive to Pearl.

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:29.000
So Diamond only gets three types, or three Pokemon, rather, that you can use fire with.

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:32.000
And, you know, that might be good enough for a lot of people,

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:40.000
but it seems the Pokemon fanbase in general likes to have as much variety as possible,

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:47.000
and that really paints you into a corner of having to pick Ho Monkey, or Chimchar, is what he's actually called,

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:52.000
if you want a decent fire type in either of the games, honestly.

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:59.000
Interesting. So, if you kind of don't pick Chimchar as your starter type, you're going to be boxed in.

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:01.000
Is there a grass gym that you have to fight at some point,

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:04.000
or something where you kind of need fire types to get through it easier?

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:14.000
Yeah, there's... Sorry, you know that grass is not the only thing that is weak to fire.

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:17.000
Well, yeah, but it's just the one that comes to mind.

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:25.000
Well, you do have a grass, you have ice, so both of those, you get right there, you've got a steel gym.

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:32.000
So that's three gyms right there that you would be totally great to have a good fire type with.

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:39.000
There's even an Elite Four that is bugged. Well, why don't you burn the bug too?

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:45.000
Gotcha. So is that, I mean, is it the variety? Is that where people kind of just had issues,

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:52.000
where the Pokemon just got us interesting, or why do people not usually talk about Gen 4 as their fave?

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:57.000
Well, you can't really say people don't talk about Gen 4 as their fave,

01:23:57.000 --> 01:24:02.000
because everybody has a gym that they like, and everybody's very vocal about it,

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:11.000
but I think even the people that love Gen 4 can agree that these issues that come up,

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:18.000
their pacing is not great in the game, the spread of Pokemon not that great,

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:20.000
they find other reasons to love it.

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:28.000
One example, the music. When you are hopefully watching that video, can they hear the music?

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:30.000
It's going to be faint in the background, but it'll come through.

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:39.000
Okay. When the character goes up to the lake very early on, the music at the lake is amazing.

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:47.000
I haven't played Gen 4, to be honest, in years and years and years, because it's not Gen 5, why would I care?

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:52.000
But they did a really good job with the music in this game.

01:24:52.000 --> 01:25:01.000
And I know that the storyline, and this applies to people complaining nowadays about the newer Pokemon,

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:04.000
the storyline in this game is actually pretty dark.

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:13.000
The evil team basically wants to wipe out everything and start all over, so everybody dies.

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:14.000
Yikes.

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:18.000
And for what's a kid's game, that's a little harsh.

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:20.000
So what about some of the good things, though?

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:25.000
Because obviously it'd be weird if we sat here and just talked about all the bad things about a classic game of the week,

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:31.000
but surely there must have been things that Gen 4 brought to the table that future Pokemon games influenced.

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:35.000
You know, Gen 2 was the first one with gender outside of Nidoran.

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:41.000
Gen 3 had the berries. There's other stuff, too. What was new in Gen 4?

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:49.000
So, the battle system in Gen 4, it changed up how attacks worked.

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:58.000
It now, in Gen 4, attacks are either physical or special by how the attack actually operates.

01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:01.000
So, like, if it touches the enemy or not.

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:07.000
That wasn't the case in the games up to this point.

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:15.000
So, Thunder Punch is physical because it's a punch, and Hyper Beam would be special.

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:22.000
So that's actually something that's been carried forward since the introduction in Gen 4.

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:28.000
So, that's definitely a legacy that you can look back to Gen 4 and be like,

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:35.000
okay, this is where it started, this is why Pokemon Battle feels better, to be honest.

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:38.000
And this was the first game that was dual screen, right?

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:41.000
Because Gen 3 was a Game Boy Advance game, right?

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:44.000
So Gen 4 was the first, like, dual screen, yeah, yeah.

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:49.000
Correct. And, while it does dual screen, and probably because of it,

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:54.000
a negative for you is that it dropped back down to 30 frames a second.

01:26:54.000 --> 01:27:00.000
So, I don't think many people care about that, but, you know, just a little trivia there.

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:01.000
Yeah, interesting.

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:06.000
Well, and plus, I guess it should be noted that, you know, now that we know that Gen 9, no, 8,

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:10.000
I always lose count, Gen 8 is gonna be on the Switch.

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:13.000
I mean, presumably, we're going back to a single screen format.

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:19.000
So it's like 4, 5, 6, and 7 will all kind of exist in this double screen world that is essentially,

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:22.000
as far as we know, anyway, is gonna be gone on the Switch version.

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:26.000
I mean, we don't know, they might split the screen on the Switch, they might do something,

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:29.000
but we're kind of assuming we're going back to single screen.

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:34.000
Let's go Pikachu and Eevee, those abominations of Pokemon games.

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:37.000
They were single screen.

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:39.000
That's true, that's true.

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:45.000
But, I mean, I guess those are, I count those as spin-offs, but I guess they are kind of Gen 1 remakes in a way.

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:50.000
But the Pokemon company does not count them as spin-offs, they count them as mainline games.

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:52.000
Which is a whole other fight for another day.

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:53.000
Yeah, I guess so.

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:58.000
Well, speaking of, like, remakes and all that stuff, did they ever remake Gen 4?

01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:01.000
Not yet. It would technically be next in line.

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:07.000
Yeah, I was gonna say, it should be the next one to be remade, but maybe not, because they went back to Gen 1, right?

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:12.000
Yeah, they did.

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:16.000
Much to a lot of people's chagrins.

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:28.000
But, you know, I feel like since they're moving everything over from their quote-unquote handheld division of systems,

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:31.000
even though the Switch is handheld but it can be whatever,

01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:35.000
they needed to start off with something they felt was strong,

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:41.000
and unfortunately, just do the Gen 1 pandering and that should be strong enough.

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:45.000
I know this is a Gen 4 discussion,

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:50.000
and I'd be a terrible host if I didn't ask, why do you not care for Gen 1, it seems?

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:53.000
I mean, I guess, like, Gen 1, I don't know.

01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:59.000
Like, I think maybe because of Pokemon Go or people being kids that are, like, 30 and 40 now that were kids when Gen 1 came out.

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:05.000
It seems like there's so much nostalgia in Gen 1, but you don't like it nearly as much.

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:09.000
You probably like Gen 4 more than you like Gen 1.

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:12.000
You're probably right.

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:15.000
It's just the mechanics, the pacing.

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:19.000
I don't like the Pokemon for the most part in Gen 1.

01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:27.000
I know that's a terrible thing to say, but outside of just a handful, they're not that interesting to me.

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:36.000
But, you know, I get a lot of crap because my favorite's Gen 5, which is basically a remake of Gen 1, but using entirely different Pokemon.

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:39.000
And I'm cool with that. I think it's great.

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:43.000
And Gen 1 was my first game, too, so I don't even have that nostalgia there.

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:51.000
But maybe I had, like, a rebirth of nostalgia because I was kind of, you know, not very hardcore into it until Gen 5 came out.

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:55.000
Then I just threw myself into it and never looked back.

01:29:55.000 --> 01:30:06.000
Well, if you want to compare to another geek culture thing, Episode 7 was essentially a remake of Episode 4, but we had to suffer through Episodes 1, 2, and 3 to get there. Right?

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:08.000
I'm talking Star Wars.

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:09.000
That's correct.

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:12.000
Because, like, Episode 7 of what?

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:15.000
Star Wars. Right.

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:23.000
The segment's running a little long and we've got to get back to the show, but I have to ask about the actual... What?

01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:27.000
I have one more thing I have to say about that real quick before you say anything.

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:36.000
Because there is one major thing that I did not hit on that's super important is that Gen 4 introduced the global trade system.

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:43.000
So, that way you can throw Pokémon up, get something randomly docked.

01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:53.000
And that is, oh yeah, because, like, you know, I remember using that in X and Y and the Sun and Moon, and, like, you'd just throw garbage out there and you'd get, like, hacked Pokémon in return.

01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:56.000
Yeah, that's why I never used it.

01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:59.000
My Pokémon are legit.

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:03.000
The thing I wanted to ask about before we go back to the live show is the Pokémon themselves.

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:09.000
We've talked about a couple of them. I don't know if you don't want to name the one that's in the movie because maybe it's a potential spoiler.

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:15.000
And we talked about Chimchar, but, like, what are your, I mean, surely, even if Gen 4 is kind of like your, eh, it's all right.

01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:19.000
Like, what are, like, some of your favorite Pokémon that Gen 4 introduced?

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:24.000
Oh, that, ooh, ooh, ooh, okay.

01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:28.000
I would say Shinx. Shinx's entire line. I love that.

01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:38.000
I actually still have, to this day, my original Shinx that I caught in that copy of Diamond. I passed him through the games all the way up.

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:48.000
So, um, he would be my favorite. Um, what other ones are there?

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:53.000
Well, my favorite is Bidoof and the most, the most memeable Pokémon, maybe, besides Mudkip.

01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:56.000
Yours is Bidoof.

01:31:56.000 --> 01:32:02.000
Um, okay, so, I like all the starters. All the starters for Gen 4 are great.

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:07.000
Like, Churchwig through Empoleon, you guys are great.

01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:12.000
Uh, they have a really good bird line in Starly, going up to Staraptor.

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:15.000
And then we did Shinx and Luxray, got that out of the way.

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:23.000
And then, really, after that, um, not, not seeing a whole lot.

01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:28.000
And, and I know this from playing Pokémon GO, which we should, you know, mention.

01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:32.000
Gen 4 is the most recent gen you can catch in Pokémon GO.

01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:37.000
They haven't unleashed Gen 5 yet, so kind of Gen 4 is, like, the new stuff, even though it's been a few months.

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:44.000
But, you know, you kind of notice through Gen 4, there's a lot of, like, babies of earlier Pokémon, right?

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:46.000
Like Munchlax, there's, like, a baby Snorlax, right?

01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:51.000
And there's also future evolutions of some of the, you know, Gen 1 Pokémon.

01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:58.000
Like, uh, Magmortar is there, Electrovire, um, and then, like, Togepi from Gen 2 got Togekiss, right?

01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:05.000
So, it's interesting that, like, a lot of Gen 4 is kind of just, like, evolves and devolves of some of the original Pokémon.

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:12.000
Yeah, and I guess that's, uh, sort of a theme you could put on to Gen 4, is that this one is all about

01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:22.000
breeding and evolution, so they give you new babies and new Evos for things that really didn't need them, or should have had them earlier.

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:24.000
Alright. Well, um,

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:32.000
We also got, uh, because it's not GO yet, we also got new Eevee evolutions, because it's an even numbered generation, so that was cool.

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:36.000
That's right, and those haven't showed up in GO yet. GO doesn't have all of Gen 4 yet, just a big chunk of it.

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:40.000
Nope. It's gonna take, like, another year or so for the five left.

01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:51.000
Alright, well, we gotta wrap up and head back, uh, live to the studio, but there it is, your Classic Game of the Week, uh, a timely selection with the new movie that everybody's talking about this week, but it's Pokémon Diamond and Pearl.

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:56.000
And, uh, Shane, thank you for being here and filling in tonight. Do you have, uh, anything else you wanna say?

01:33:56.000 --> 01:34:01.000
Uh, you wanna give a quick spoiler-free review of Detective Pikachu real quick?

01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:15.000
It was really, really awesome, and if you are a Pokémon fan at all, you will walk out of the theater wishing you could go to Rhyme City and live there forever.

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:24.000
I have to kind of agree with you, that's kind of how I felt. I just, I loved, and I probably already said this earlier in the show, but I'll say it again, I loved how it just unapologetically made Pokémon real.

01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:27.000
Like, they've, they've just, they've just always been there.

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:37.000
And they did a great job with the designs, but there are, like, a couple standouts that are nightmare fuel. Like, absolute nightmare fuel.

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:43.000
I won't say, because I don't want to spoil, because at least one of them has not shown up in the trailer, so.

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:54.000
Yeah, that's fair, that's fair. Alright, well, before we get into spoiler territory, we will go back to the show. Um, is there any, like, social media, I know you don't have a podcast regularly anymore, but is there anything you want to plug, social media or anything like that?

01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:56.000
No, not really.

01:34:56.000 --> 01:35:02.000
Alright. Well, thanks for being here, Shane, and we're gonna head back to the show live.

01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:04.000
Alright.

01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:10.000
Alright, we're back. Thanks so much to Shane for helping to fill in this week with the Classic Game of the Week.

01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:19.000
I kind of, I kind of thought he might pick a Pokémon game, so it all worked out, because I know a lot of people were talking about that this week, but I like how he kind of tied it into the movie.

01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:33.000
And, yeah, I didn't really think about that, but I guess there's really only, like, one Gen 4 Pokémon, again, I don't know if it's spoilery, so I won't say who, but, uh, that shows up in the game, so it's, it was kind of, like, not as well represented as maybe some other generations in the, uh, movie.

01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:36.000
I mean, I would have expected a lot of Gen 1 stuff.

01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:39.000
I think they had stuff sprinkled around, just not, like, main character.

01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:41.000
Yeah, he said there's, like, statues and paintings and things.

01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:50.000
Well, no, I think there's actually, um, like, legit Gen 4 Pokémon that were walking around, like, in the, like, especially in the beginning, like, where it's kind of showing just, like, the city.

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:51.000
Yeah.

01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:52.000
Gotcha.

01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:56.000
Uh, and, uh, S2100Matt says, Shane is currently seeing it his fifth time.

01:35:56.000 --> 01:36:09.000
I think he actually is on his second. He did say he was going back to see it on Sunday, but I don't think it's going to turn into, like, uh, Love, Simon, which he saw, like, 40 or 45 times in theater, and that's not a figure of speech, like, it was 40 times in theater, so I don't think it's going to be that.

01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:19.000
But, uh, yeah, it's good to have him back on the show, so even though we miss Dark Soccer tonight, but she'll be back next week, and I think she'll be due for a soundtrack next week, so stay tuned for that.

01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:24.000
In the meantime, we're going to get back into what we're doing here tonight. Sadly, I still don't have Jason in the studio.

01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:29.000
I know his ETA was 730, but that was before he pulled over in a safe way to use the Wi-Fi.

01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:33.000
So, hopefully, everything's still okay with him. We'll get to hear from him a little later on in the show.

01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:36.000
We still got some ground to cover, though, before we get there, right?

01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:37.000
Yeah.

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:38.000
Let's get to some rapid-fire news, Logie.

01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:46.000
Alright, so, for May, we're getting some new games for the Nintendo Switch Online NES Archive service.

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:53.000
So, we've got, um, starting off with Donkey Kong Jr., Clu Clu Land, and VS Excitebike.

01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:58.000
So, those will be, um, available on the 15th, in a few more days.

01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:05.000
And then, uh, we've got a brand new Super Monkey Ball game, apparently coming out soon.

01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:11.000
Apparently, Sega has filed a trademark in Japan for Tabe Goro Super Monkey Ball.

01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:18.000
And, apparently, Tabe Goro translates to riper in season or good to eat, something along those lines.

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:27.000
The thought, I think, was that this might be almost like a, um, like a kind of a classic remake or something,

01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:30.000
like they did with the Sonic games.

01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:33.000
So, maybe we'll see that with Super Monkey Ball instead.

01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:39.000
Which I would be totally cool with because, um, I thought Super Monkey Ball was a lot of fun.

01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:41.000
We haven't seen one of those games in a while.

01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:42.000
No, long time.

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:44.000
The last one I could think of was, like, on the Wii, maybe with the motion controls.

01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:45.000
It's about the last time I could think of.

01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:50.000
Well, apparently, the last one actually was released, um, in 2014 on iOS and Android.

01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:52.000
Oh, right. Of course, of course, because there was a mobile phone one, of course.

01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:53.000
Yes.

01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:54.000
Of course. Alright.

01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:57.000
Um, some other rapid-fire news, uh, stories to talk about.

01:37:57.000 --> 01:38:01.000
I mentioned we'd talk about some of the other things that came up during the state of play with PlayStation.

01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:06.000
And this was one that certainly caught my eye, is that they are making a game out of Predator.

01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:09.000
Which, I mean, you know, Predator has had plenty of games.

01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:11.000
And I mean, like, the movie, right? The Predator.

01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:17.000
Uh, so, uh, Predator's had certain video games before, but this is a new one called Predator Hunting Grounds.

01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:21.000
Uh, it is supposed to be a competitive online multiplayer experience.

01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:26.000
So, that kind of sounds like one person's the predator and the rest are the prey.

01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:28.000
It's Friday the 13th all over again.

01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:29.000
Exactly.

01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:31.000
Or, what's the other one?

01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:32.000
Evolve will be in...

01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:34.000
No, not Evolve. There's, um...

01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:35.000
Dead by Daylight.

01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:36.000
Yeah.

01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:37.000
Yeah, those types of things.

01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:38.000
So, uh...

01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:41.000
Didn't one of those have the Predator in it? I may be thinking of Call of Duty did, like, that thing.

01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:47.000
Um, Dead by Daylight has a lot of the, I almost said Scream Queens, but Slasher.

01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:52.000
Uh, because I think they just spotted the ghost face from, um, Scream is supposed to be coming to that.

01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:53.000
And, uh, some other things.

01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:56.000
But I don't know if Predator is one of them in Dead by Daylight.

01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:59.000
Another thing, it was for Call of Duty, it was one of the, um...

01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:03.000
I think it was Black Ops 3 or something like that, where they did, um...

01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:06.000
Like, a special event where you could become the Predator type thing.

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:09.000
Hi, Jason. Good to see you in studio.

01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:12.000
If you're gonna put your face on the camera, I have to acknowledge you, because the Twitch people are gonna be like,

01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:13.000
What's that? How you doing?

01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:14.000
Yeah.

01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:15.000
Yeah.

01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:19.000
Is this microphone ready for the deep, dulcet tones that are certainly not Jamie's voice?

01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:22.000
I think so. In fact, it might actually be tuned a little high, because Jamie...

01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:23.000
Or, you know what I mean.

01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:24.000
Yeah.

01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:25.000
You might be actually coming through a little loud.

01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:27.000
More reverberary versus more airy and...

01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:28.000
A little bit.

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:29.000
Yeah.

01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:31.000
So we were just talking about Predator coming out on PlayStation.

01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:34.000
Do you like the Friday the 13th? No.

01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:39.000
I've never seen any... I've seen bits and pieces of Alien, I've never seen anything Predator.

01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:43.000
I've enjoyed some of the Dead by Daylight and Friday the 13th stuff that I've watched.

01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:44.000
Okay.

01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:47.000
Yeah, Dead by Daylight is a huge Twitch game.

01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:50.000
I know you've been participating for a long time in Twitch culture.

01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:52.000
And we're probably one of the people that were like,

01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:54.000
you know, OLR should have moved to Twitch a long time ago.

01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:58.000
But Dead by Daylight is huge in Twitch culture.

01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:00.000
That's a very popular stream game out there.

01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:05.000
Yeah. It's very role-playable and repeatedly role-playable.

01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:08.000
Yes. I'm just going to turn your volume down just a tad.

01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:09.000
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:10.000
Just a little bit.

01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:13.000
All right. You're fine. You don't have to make those noises. It's a little weird.

01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:14.000
All right. Anyway.

01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:16.000
I just like looking at the fancy little dials you have up here.

01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:17.000
Yeah.

01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:18.000
I haven't been here since this setup.

01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:21.000
It's been quite literally a year because we tend to,

01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:24.000
work tends to have our all hands around May-ish.

01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:27.000
Yeah. So this is the first time you've seen it with the whole video setup.

01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:31.000
It's really, if you think about it, or I mean, as you can attest to,

01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:33.000
it's not that different from what it was before,

01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:39.000
except for I was more facing the wall instead of actually looking at my co-hosts.

01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:41.000
Now it's all like video production and shit.

01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:45.000
I know. I know. The very first video production we ever did,

01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:48.000
I got a note that said, Rob, you never look at your co-hosts.

01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:51.000
I'm like, it's radio. I don't have to.

01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:53.000
We had to change that.

01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:55.000
There's a lot of things, for all the things that you don't see,

01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:59.000
it's always fun to kind of look back and be able to sit there

01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:02.000
and hear all of the camaraderie and interaction.

01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:05.000
And then the fact that everybody is paying attention to each other

01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:09.000
and participating, but not necessarily in the showy presentation,

01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:12.000
not necessarily needing all of the obvious body language

01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:13.000
and everything else that you deal with.

01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:17.000
It's just multitasking, or it's like having a phone call or something,

01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:20.000
or playing games online, talking on Discord or something like that.

01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:21.000
That's kind of like what it was.

01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:23.000
But I do think there's always been a very,

01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:26.000
not to toot our own horn very much,

01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:28.000
but I think part of what's made this show unique

01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:31.000
out of the literally thousands of gaming podcasts that are out there,

01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:34.000
not just how fucking long we've been doing it for 13 years,

01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:37.000
but the fact that we're in the same room doing it.

01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:39.000
Now, I know there's other shows that do it that way too,

01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:45.000
but I would say 5 or 10 percent tops are doing it in all the same room.

01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:47.000
And I think that's part of what makes this a little bit special.

01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:49.000
So, yeah, fun. Anyway.

01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:50.000
All right, so let's get back.

01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:51.000
It's the longest running in many ways.

01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:53.000
Let's get back into some other rapid fire news,

01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:55.000
and I'll come back and ask you about your gaming week

01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:58.000
and all that fun stuff and your trip today,

01:41:58.000 --> 01:41:59.000
because I still think that's hilarious,

01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:02.000
that you pulled over at a Safeway to get us the bump tonight.

01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:04.000
And your intro, you very clearly didn't give a fuck,

01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:05.000
and I thought it was great.

01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:08.000
But let's talk about Castlevania.

01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:09.000
Oh, yes, that's a series we all love,

01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:14.000
and there's some new music that is coming out on the different streaming sites.

01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:18.000
So, new Castlevania soundtracks, or I should say old Castlevania soundtracks,

01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:21.000
are new again thanks to showing up on streaming websites,

01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:23.000
which include Spotify, which I know a lot of you use,

01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:26.000
Apple Music, and Google Play.

01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:29.000
Soundtracks such as Castlevania Symphony of the Night,

01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:32.000
and Castlevania 64, Castlevania Chronicles, Curse of Darkness,

01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:34.000
Portrait of Ruin, and so forth.

01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:37.000
And, Jason, just be aware we can see your laptop a little bit,

01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:39.000
so just in case you're doing anything sensitive on there.

01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:43.000
If you need to see the monitor, it's up there and shows you what they can see.

01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:47.000
I still want you to bring up work stuff or something that might be sensitive,

01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:48.000
because you never know.

01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:49.000
It's all blown out.

01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:51.000
All right.

01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:56.000
Anyway, you can check out the Castlevania soundtracks on those various websites,

01:42:56.000 --> 01:42:59.000
which maybe I'll do later on.

01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:00.000
That sounds like a plan.

01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:05.000
Anyway, let's travel around the world and check out what is coming out in a store near you

01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:08.000
with some world release dates.

01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:09.000
Yes.

01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:12.000
So, we've got a few things coming out this week.

01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:20.000
So, starting off with a Plague Tale, Innocence, on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:23.000
Darkwood on PlayStation 4.

01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:27.000
Rage 2 is coming out this week on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:30.000
Redout on Nintendo Switch.

01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:35.000
World End Syndrome on the Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4.

01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:40.000
Bubsy, Paws on Fire on PC, Switch, and PlayStation 4.

01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:45.000
Speaking of Castlevania, the Castlevania Anniversary Collection is coming out this week.

01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:49.000
PC, Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:54.000
And then, of course, Darkwood is also coming out other days during this week on other systems,

01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:56.000
so on Switch and Xbox One as well.

01:43:56.000 --> 01:43:58.000
And that is it.

01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:01.000
I wonder if that's kind of why they put out all those Castlevania soundtracks now,

01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:05.000
is to get people talking about Castlevania just in time for that collection to be on its way out to stores.

01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:06.000
Maybe.

01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:07.000
Maybe.

01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:08.000
Anyway, going to Japan.

01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:11.000
It's been a little slow in Japan because we're just off the heels of Golden Week,

01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:14.000
but we finally actually have some releases this week in Japan,

01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:18.000
even though it still is a little slow as we ramp up back after the holidays in Japan.

01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:25.000
But we do have Ys, Memory of Celceta, coming out this week on the PlayStation 4.

01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:30.000
So that Ys series has been around forever, so that is pretty cool that that is coming out.

01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:36.000
And then over on the Nintendo Switch, Roller Coaster Tycoon Adventures gets a kind of localized,

01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:39.000
they're actually labeling it a multi-language release, but that is coming out in Japan.

01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:49.000
And Hanayakanari Waga Ichi Zoku Modern Nostalgia for Nintendo Switch in a regular and limited edition.

01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:53.000
That is really the only other release out there this week.

01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:57.000
Oh, this came out on PlayStation 4 not that long ago.

01:44:57.000 --> 01:45:02.000
It's like you're finally getting to marry the maid girl of your dreams is what it looks like.

01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:04.000
Or at least, I don't know, it's kind of one of those visual novel type of games.

01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:07.000
Gee, I never would have imagined where they'd get that storyline from.

01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:08.000
I know.

01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:10.000
What a completely unique...

01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:12.000
Good help is hard to marry.

01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:13.000
Yeah.

01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:14.000
Stop it.

01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:20.000
Anyway, we are going to get into the UK release dates, then we'll get to the mailbag.

01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:27.000
Yeah, so the UK also has Rage 2 coming out as well on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.

01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:31.000
Plague Tale Innocence on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:35.000
Guilty Gear 20th Anniversary Edition on the Nintendo Switch.

01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:38.000
Wasteland 2 on the Nintendo Switch.

01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:43.000
Sniper Elite V2 Remastered on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and the Switch.

01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:49.000
And last but not least, the Steven Universe Double Pack on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and the Switch.

01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:53.000
Alright, let's head on over to the mailbag.

01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:55.000
Every week we invite you guys to email us.

01:45:55.000 --> 01:46:00.000
Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com and we read our favorite emails here on the air.

01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:02.000
Or else we talk about RuPaul's Drag Race.

01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:05.000
But we did get one email this week to save you from Drag Race discussion,

01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:07.000
which is probably for the best because Jamie's not here tonight.

01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:09.000
So do you watch RuPaul's Drag Race, Jason?

01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:10.000
No.

01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:12.000
It's probably for the best. We did get an email tonight.

01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:14.000
An email from YYR who emailed us to say,

01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:22.000
Hello, LR. This email has been sent to acknowledge the Dream Game submission from last week's episode on Sunday, May 5th.

01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:26.000
Your submission has been received. Please allow two to three months for processing.

01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:29.000
Thank you for using the YYR game's Dream Game submission service.

01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:31.000
I don't even remember what I said.

01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:33.000
And now I'm worried.

01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:35.000
Chat, what did we say for a Dream Game?

01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:38.000
I seriously don't even remember what we said for a Dream Game last week.

01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:39.000
That's how this show goes.

01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:43.000
I just say things and then a week goes by and I'm like, what?

01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:45.000
So, uh, yeah.

01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:49.000
A lot of people in the chat are like, I forgot too.

01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:51.000
Well, luckily we have a girlfriend.

01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:53.000
A week ago? I don't know what happened two days ago.

01:46:53.000 --> 01:46:55.000
Wait, you want me to go back and listen? I know, I can't even remember what I did yesterday.

01:46:55.000 --> 01:46:57.000
What day it is? What day is tomorrow?

01:46:57.000 --> 01:47:02.000
I know, if you ask me what missions in Ingress I did literally earlier today, I'd be like, um...

01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:04.000
The ones where you hack portals and destroy other ones.

01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:06.000
There was one at Sutter's Fort.

01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:11.000
Anyway, thank you for the email.

01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:14.000
If you want to send us an email, participate at orangetontrader.com.

01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:17.000
Oh, shit, Darktitsui, I can't even remember what it was.

01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:19.000
So, it didn't happen, almost.

01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:21.000
If our historian can't remember...

01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:25.000
That would be funny because if YYR is serious, then he might be exploring actually making a game out of it.

01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:28.000
Which, I don't know, he might just be in a tease or whatever.

01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:33.000
It would be really funny that when he's ready to debut, he'd be like, remember when he asked for this?

01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:35.000
No!

01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:37.000
No, but actually, you know what'll happen?

01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:44.000
It'll be because, like, I'll be like, when he says the name, I'll be like, oh fuck, I did say that, didn't I?

01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:45.000
That's usually how this...

01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:47.000
I did say that, didn't I?

01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:48.000
Oh, man.

01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:50.000
Wow, I'm horrible.

01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:51.000
Alright, anyway.

01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:53.000
Uh, Jason, we can use the opportunity to catch up with you a little bit.

01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:54.000
Howdy, Rob.

01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:55.000
How are you doing?

01:47:55.000 --> 01:47:56.000
Long time, no see.

01:47:56.000 --> 01:48:00.000
So, I know you're in the chair where the viewers can't see you as well, just because...

01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:04.000
I knew you were coming here mid-show, so I didn't have time to, like, figure out what the spacing would be like over here.

01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:05.000
I can just kinda do...

01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:06.000
Oh, is the mic gonna fit?

01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:07.000
Do one of these numbers.

01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:09.000
Okay, you're gonna come up...

01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:10.000
Ah, fuck Pikachu.

01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:11.000
Alright.

01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:12.000
Hi, buddy!

01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:14.000
He's getting enough air time, we don't really frickin' need him.

01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:16.000
Just all these stuffed animals going everywhere, who cares?

01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:18.000
Okay, why don't you have that guy on your shoulder there?

01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:20.000
He'd be a little Pokemon partner.

01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:23.000
How have you been?

01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:27.000
Especially in very, very recent times, quite busy.

01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:28.000
Yeah?

01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:29.000
Um...

01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:30.000
That's good, though.

01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:32.000
That's better than sitting around being sad.

01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:33.000
Yeah.

01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:34.000
I mean, that still happens, too.

01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:35.000
That's life.

01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:36.000
Yeah, I'm so desperate.

01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:37.000
That's life.

01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:38.000
We all have our sad days.

01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:45.000
Um, I have been following a wrestling promotion back home on and off for the last three years and change.

01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:50.000
Um, and when I was at TwitchCon San Jose last October, um...

01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:51.000
How was that?

01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:52.000
I'm sad I made...

01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:55.000
They did it on, like, the worst possible weekend for me.

01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:56.000
Yeah.

01:48:56.000 --> 01:48:57.000
The worst...

01:48:57.000 --> 01:48:58.000
It's better this year, because it's September and not Halloween.

01:48:58.000 --> 01:48:59.000
It is.

01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:01.000
And one of my friends is moving to San Diego, so I might have a place to stay.

01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:03.000
It's in San Diego again, which is even better.

01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:04.000
Frickin' love Gaslamp.

01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:05.000
That place was amazing.

01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:07.000
Hands easily the best to date.

01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:09.000
Um, it was...

01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:10.000
It was busy.

01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:11.000
It was hectic.

01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:12.000
It was growing.

01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:14.000
It was everything that a con is supposed to be.

01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:18.000
Um, you know, my personal opinions aside, it certainly went off and they did amazing

01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:22.000
stuff, um, as they always do with content production and good expos.

01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:27.000
Uh, a lot of stuff that we saw in progress with TwitchExtensions really starting to grow

01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:29.000
that we've seen a lot over the last couple of years.

01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:31.000
We're just kind of budding back then.

01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:35.000
And we've seen Twitch Sings that has debuted officially over the last couple of months.

01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:39.000
And for the music streamers that I follow, it's been fun seeing them do that.

01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:42.000
Add that to their repertoire of the content that they create on there as well.

01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:44.000
I'm thinking about it.

01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:45.000
I'm thinking about it, Twitch.

01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:46.000
But I'm not.

01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:47.000
I'm not a singer.

01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:50.000
Somebody has some, uh, somebody has some history with songs.

01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:51.000
I don't know.

01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:54.000
I don't know what'll get added to the library, but we could have a reprieve over here.

01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:55.000
No.

01:49:55.000 --> 01:50:00.000
My concern, and this will totally make sense why I say it's a concern slash, but it's also

01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:01.000
a positive.

01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:05.000
My concern is that if I do a Twitch Sings stream, it will give Travis Donovan a reason

01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:08.000
to come back, which don't get me wrong.

01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:09.000
That's the good side.

01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:12.000
Him coming back to do a show would be a good thing, but he would, he would embarrass me

01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:16.000
every single week with whatever I decided to sing.

01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:19.000
If I just, it's like a prayer in Twitch Sings.

01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:21.000
I haven't paid any attention.

01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:24.000
I can't even, I think I know Disney songs and that's pretty much it.

01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:29.000
I sang that song in a karaoke booth like 20 years ago and got a 15 year sentence for

01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:30.000
it.

01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:34.000
So, you know, was it one of the ones that grades you however the hell that works?

01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:37.000
No, Travis Donovan and his audience graded me for the next 15 years.

01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:38.000
Even better.

01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:39.000
It'll actually be accurate.

01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:43.000
I went to some Korean, uh, Korean system karaoke.

01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:44.000
Where was that?

01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:48.000
Uh, as a matter of fact, I think it was in San Diego, um, that I was out there for work

01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:51.000
and, uh, it gives you a score on a scale of a hundred at the very end.

01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:53.000
And who even, I don't even.

01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:54.000
Oh yeah.

01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:57.000
Back in the DDR days when we were going to all those tournaments and all that shit, right?

01:50:57.000 --> 01:51:02.000
We went to a tournament in Koreatown in LA and I remember there was a DDR tournament

01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:07.000
going on, but I, it was freestyle and I wasn't like judging or anything and I'm not good

01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:08.000
at freestyle.

01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:11.000
Like it's always like they did perfect attack in the morning and then freestyle.

01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:12.000
So I would do my perfect tackling.

01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:16.000
So anyway, my point is princess Irene and I ended up going in one of those karaoke booths

01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:17.000
in the back of the Korean arcade.

01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:21.000
And I, I shit you not, we spent at least like three hours in that thing while the entire

01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:22.000
freestyle tournament was going on.

01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:27.000
We were singing and it was one of those things that would grade you because I remember, I

01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:30.000
remember the song that I got a hundred percent on.

01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:31.000
Oh shit.

01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:36.000
To this day, all through the night by Cyndi Lauper.

01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:39.000
Not one of her biggest hits.

01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:44.000
I would sing it for you, but I'm not going to do that because it will be a clip anyway.

01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:51.000
Uh, yeah, so when, uh, on the very last day of the con on Sunday, um, the wrestling promotion

01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:56.000
back home had a morning, uh, panel and I didn't wake up for it in time.

01:51:56.000 --> 01:51:58.000
Fuck mornings and cons.

01:51:58.000 --> 01:51:59.000
I go, I go there for the people anyway.

01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:00.000
So it's like, Hey, that's happening.

01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:01.000
Okay, cool.

01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:02.000
I'll see you back home anyways.

01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:06.000
Uh, and I was, as I was wrapping up for lunch, I literally was collecting my trash and standing

01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:11.000
up and an individual with the promotion came in, sat down and set the Twitch championship

01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:14.000
title, which the promotion owns, sets it right on the table.

01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:20.000
I look at it, I look at him, I say, I know you, I missed your panel today, but I know

01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:21.000
you.

01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:24.000
Um, and so the long and the short of it is that, uh, what's the promotion?

01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:25.000
Are you allowed to talk about it?

01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:26.000
Absolutely.

01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:31.000
Uh, Rocky mountain pro, uh, is based in technically golden Colorado.

01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:34.000
It'll be said as just Denver, uh, more often.

01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:38.000
Um, they that's, that's kind of like any place in Colorado.

01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:43.000
People are like, Oh, Denver, Denver, Denver's kind of, it's either Denver border, Colorado

01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:45.000
Springs or fricking flatlands.

01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:49.000
Even when you used to say Colorado Springs, I'd be like, isn't that near Denver?

01:52:49.000 --> 01:52:52.000
I live halfway in between Denver and Colorado Springs.

01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:53.000
You know what?

01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:56.000
If I travel to Canada or something and I'm like, yeah, I'm from Sacramento, California,

01:52:56.000 --> 01:52:57.000
huh?

01:52:57.000 --> 01:52:58.000
The Capitol, huh?

01:52:58.000 --> 01:53:00.000
It's like two hours outside San Francisco.

01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:01.000
Oh, okay.

01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:06.000
But yet, equidistant on I-5 if you're coming, if you're going north to San Francisco.

01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:14.000
Um, as of the end of last year, uh, they tape live and stream and in the last month have

01:53:14.000 --> 01:53:18.000
a TV deal every single Thursday for two hours of content.

01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:27.000
Uh, they had a big camp weekend with a bunch of indie hopefuls and, uh, in the legacy,

01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:32.000
like legacy, legacy, big tier names that were in for a whole weekend of training and had

01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:36.000
events every single day, Thursday through Sunday.

01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:40.000
Um, and that kind of inspired me to decide to get up and be part of the festivities.

01:53:40.000 --> 01:53:47.000
So I have been working with them since, uh, I think it was the last week of March.

01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:48.000
What are you doing?

01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:49.000
Promotions?

01:53:49.000 --> 01:53:50.000
Or do you, do you actually like commentate?

01:53:50.000 --> 01:53:51.000
Cause your voice would be perfect.

01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:55.000
I, uh, when we, when we've done that in testing, I can't keep up with the speech.

01:53:55.000 --> 01:54:00.000
I, I've been so detached from wrestling that the detail is so hard for me to keep up with.

01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:02.000
Video game commentating is a similar thing.

01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:04.000
You have to practice and practice a lot.

01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:10.000
Um, I chiefly have been doing audio production for them, so actually getting mixers and everything

01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:12.000
else in order, working with the audio equipment they have.

01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:15.000
I've made a couple donations of my own.

01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:16.000
Yeah.

01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:19.000
Considering that if the camera wasn't on, that was going to be the very first thing

01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:20.000
I was going to come and do.

01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:23.000
I was going to walk in and go, this sounds a little weird.

01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:24.000
This sounds a little weird.

01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:25.000
Okay.

01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:26.000
Listen to it again later.

01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:27.000
You can do it after the show.

01:54:27.000 --> 01:54:30.000
You have free, you have free, you can, I will let, there's not a lot of people I will say

01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:31.000
this to Jason, but you can touch things.

01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:33.000
You can touch things after the show.

01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:35.000
Shinies!

01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:38.000
If Bobby Blackwoofer here, don't touch, don't touch that.

01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:39.000
Don't touch that.

01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:41.000
You can, you can touch your own show.

01:54:41.000 --> 01:54:43.000
Go back to your Commodore.

01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:44.000
Uh, I'm kidding.

01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:46.000
I tease Bobby because I can and I know he's watching.

01:54:46.000 --> 01:54:51.000
Um, so, uh, you would enjoy the, the wrestling stuff they do at the theater where we do Rocky

01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:52.000
Horror.

01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:54.000
I know I'm getting off base from video games, but whatever.

01:54:54.000 --> 01:54:56.000
They do, they do like at the colonial, the colonial.

01:54:56.000 --> 01:54:57.000
Yeah.

01:54:57.000 --> 01:54:59.000
They do like a minor league wrestling thing.

01:54:59.000 --> 01:55:00.000
Yeah.

01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:01.000
Anyway.

01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:02.000
Yeah.

01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:04.000
It's, it's not something I've obviously followed the big leagues.

01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:07.000
I've gotten a little bit, especially into the Japanese promotions as they've kind of gained

01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:09.000
prominence in the last couple of years.

01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:15.000
Uh, if anybody happens to know the name Joey Ryan, uh, the Pornhub sponsored indie wrestler,

01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:16.000
Dead Serious.

01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:19.000
And yes, he has a themed signature move.

01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:23.000
I was going to suggest on Bobby's show that they sponsor E3 because you know, if we're

01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:28.000
looking for a new sponsor for E3, it would make the show much more enjoyable.

01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:29.000
Pornhub put on E3?

01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:30.000
They would get into it.

01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:31.000
Oh my God.

01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:32.000
They would absolutely get into it.

01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:33.000
So many people would go.

01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:34.000
Anyway.

01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:35.000
Um, Joey Ryan.

01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:38.000
CES is always the same time as the Adult Film Expo in Las Vegas.

01:55:38.000 --> 01:55:39.000
So, you know, why not?

01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:40.000
Is that the case?

01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:41.000
Yeah.

01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:42.000
I feel like one was January, one was February.

01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:43.000
No, they're both January.

01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:44.000
Well, I don't know.

01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:47.000
One may have moved recently, but for a while they were around the same time.

01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:48.000
Anyway.

01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:53.000
Uh, Joey Ryan has, I don't know officially what he calls it, uh, come to think of it,

01:55:53.000 --> 01:55:59.000
but, um, his competitor will ultimately wind up grabbing his dick and get suplexed with

01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:02.000
it.

01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:05.000
Woo.

01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:07.000
He is the Pornhub sponsored wrestler.

01:56:07.000 --> 01:56:09.000
He has a glorious porn stash.

01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:11.000
He oils himself up in the ring.

01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:16.000
He is, um, a character in the best possible ways of wrestling.

01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:17.000
Okay.

01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:20.000
So I just want to preface, I'm allowed to say this.

01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:22.000
This is really gay.

01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:24.000
Like what you're talking about.

01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:28.000
I mean, it's men running around in their underwear, slamming people down to the floor.

01:56:28.000 --> 01:56:29.000
So I just want to be clear.

01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:33.000
We've come to, us fans have come to accept this.

01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:38.000
You know, Dick's suplexes are something straight out of orgasm, which that is something that

01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:41.000
needs a sequel, but you know, we're never going to get that.

01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:45.000
We're going to Broadway play of that with a splash zone.

01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:46.000
How about video?

01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:47.000
Okay.

01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:52.000
Look, I gotta bring, I gotta bring it back from Dick's suplexing to happily, uh, what

01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:54.000
do you, you've been playing anything lately?

01:56:54.000 --> 01:57:00.000
Um, in my abundance of free time, considering that every Thursday with two prior days of

01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:04.000
the week of set up and then once a month, Thursday, Friday, Saturday again, and Sunday

01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:05.000
next month.

01:57:05.000 --> 01:57:11.000
And yeah, um, the, the, the cliff notes of the fun, exciting things is that I finally

01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:14.000
got it, got around to playing Red Dead Redemption one.

01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:18.000
Um, I finished that with 15 minutes left to go in 2018.

01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:23.000
Um, I was starting between a friend, let me borrow Breath of the Wild.

01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:26.000
And so I was kind of alternating Breath of the Wild and Red Dead Redemption two.

01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:30.000
And then I just went all in on Red Dead or on Breath of the Wild.

01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:34.000
I'm still working on that to this day, just kind of exploring the entirety of the universe.

01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:37.000
I have all the divine beasts beaten and just having fun with everything.

01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:39.000
There's a lot to explore, especially with the DLC.

01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:45.000
And the hero path mode is like, uh, I, so when I, when a friend borrowed it, obviously

01:57:45.000 --> 01:57:46.000
he let me have the cartridge.

01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:50.000
Um, and then I wound up saying, yeah, I'm enjoying this and just buying it and I just

01:57:50.000 --> 01:57:52.000
returned the cartridge from the other day.

01:57:52.000 --> 01:57:54.000
But I did that with all the DLC and everything else.

01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:57.000
And so now I have the ability to actually see everywhere I went and I'm like, and I

01:57:57.000 --> 01:58:00.000
don't have to, was I in this part of the city?

01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:02.000
Did I go to this forest?

01:58:02.000 --> 01:58:03.000
This swamp?

01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:04.000
This...

01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:06.000
Do you do some of the VR stuff too?

01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:08.000
I do not currently have VR.

01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:09.000
I want it.

01:58:09.000 --> 01:58:13.000
Um, there's a, there's a couple of VR installations in the Denver area of places that you can

01:58:13.000 --> 01:58:17.000
go pay a, you know, a couple bucks for 30 minutes, half an, uh, 30 minutes is half an

01:58:17.000 --> 01:58:19.000
hour, 30 minutes, hour, what have you.

01:58:19.000 --> 01:58:21.000
Um, so I've, I've played a couple, I've seen a whole bunch.

01:58:21.000 --> 01:58:24.000
Uh, I'm, I'm aware of it, but I don't personally have it in home yet.

01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:27.000
I thought for some reason, did you have like Oculus at one point?

01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:31.000
I played around with an Oculus at work and a previous previous employer.

01:58:31.000 --> 01:58:32.000
Maybe that's what it is.

01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:39.000
Um, the, uh, so yeah, that basically has been my year is been breath of the wild, very large.

01:58:39.000 --> 01:58:40.000
A couple of things.

01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:43.000
Ace combat seven came out and I fucking marched through that game and I enjoyed it.

01:58:43.000 --> 01:58:45.000
Uh, really, really good.

01:58:45.000 --> 01:58:48.000
OST I love, I love, I love

01:58:48.000 --> 01:58:54.000
A lot about series on gaming podcasts and mainstream stuff, but obviously, and you know,

01:58:54.000 --> 01:58:57.000
um, Zaku calls in once in a while and he talks about flight SIM games.

01:58:57.000 --> 01:59:01.000
I don't know if Ace combat's really flight SIM, but certainly they close, close enough,

01:59:01.000 --> 01:59:04.000
but more arcadey, which appeals a lot more to me.

01:59:04.000 --> 01:59:10.000
Would it be accurate to say it's kind of like how, um, Gran Turismo is a driving SIM.

01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:16.000
And so like you have a flight SIM, but then you have like, um, uh, initial D is more like

01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:17.000
an arcadey racer.

01:59:17.000 --> 01:59:20.000
And so split his combat, split the difference and call it burnout.

01:59:20.000 --> 01:59:21.000
Okay.

01:59:21.000 --> 01:59:22.000
Okay.

01:59:22.000 --> 01:59:23.000
Yeah.

01:59:23.000 --> 01:59:25.000
Burnout or what's, what's the new one they made dangerous driving, which I still have

01:59:25.000 --> 01:59:26.000
to play that.

01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:27.000
Yeah.

01:59:27.000 --> 01:59:32.000
A lot of fun, little destruction, car racing offshoots in the last while I missed out entirely

01:59:32.000 --> 01:59:34.000
on quest buster knows exactly this ACE combat series.

01:59:34.000 --> 01:59:37.000
ACE combat definitely leans more towards being an arcade SIM.

01:59:37.000 --> 01:59:39.000
Think of it as Daytona, but in the sky with missiles.

01:59:39.000 --> 01:59:40.000
Yeah.

01:59:40.000 --> 01:59:42.000
Well, as long as it has a rad song, I still, Oh man.

01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:53.000
Um, I haven't listened to it in ages, but, um, other than that, I spend, uh, way too

01:59:53.000 --> 01:59:55.000
much money and time at round one.

01:59:55.000 --> 02:00:01.000
Cause we had, we've had one back home since 2017, but they're finally going to open the

02:00:01.000 --> 02:00:02.000
one here in a couple of months.

02:00:02.000 --> 02:00:06.000
Uh, it says 2020 now on the sign.

02:00:06.000 --> 02:00:09.000
That's only fricking six, seven months away.

02:00:10.000 --> 02:00:11.000
What are you guys worried about?

02:00:11.000 --> 02:00:14.000
Cause you guys haven't been fortunate enough with Bahmani for the last fricking 15 years

02:00:14.000 --> 02:00:15.000
or anything.

02:00:15.000 --> 02:00:16.000
We still have to drive a little bit.

02:00:16.000 --> 02:00:20.000
I mean, Oh, a little bit over to RV GL.

02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:26.000
Oh, I thought you meant like, like, uh, well, and there was that too.

02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:28.000
I, I remember when it was completely.

02:00:28.000 --> 02:00:33.000
Is there a good, I don't know there's music games, RV GL, not anymore, but there was a

02:00:33.000 --> 02:00:34.000
spotter for a while.

02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:35.000
Really?

02:00:35.000 --> 02:00:36.000
That was like two years ago.

02:00:36.000 --> 02:00:38.000
But I was saying, um, you're thinking Scandia, I think.

02:00:38.000 --> 02:00:39.000
Oh yeah, I am.

02:00:39.000 --> 02:00:44.000
But anyway, uh, I just, I miss those days when it was like Friday after work, it's like,

02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:47.000
Hey, let's be stupid and get in the car and go to arcade infinity.

02:00:47.000 --> 02:00:49.000
We'll stay the night at motel six.

02:00:49.000 --> 02:00:50.000
All right.

02:00:50.000 --> 02:00:51.000
Yeah.

02:00:51.000 --> 02:00:55.000
And then just, that was very informative for me in my teenage years.

02:00:55.000 --> 02:00:59.000
Same when we fricking met, made this show and people were talking about distant worlds

02:00:59.000 --> 02:01:01.000
cause it came through town just the other day.

02:01:01.000 --> 02:01:02.000
I brought this up on the show.

02:01:02.000 --> 02:01:03.000
Not that long ago.

02:01:03.000 --> 02:01:04.000
I mentioned we went to that con.

02:01:04.000 --> 02:01:06.000
That was my first, dear friends.

02:01:06.000 --> 02:01:07.000
You were 18.

02:01:07.000 --> 02:01:08.000
I was 18.

02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:09.000
Oh my God.

02:01:09.000 --> 02:01:11.000
How old are you now?

02:01:11.000 --> 02:01:16.000
Yeah, I was 18 cause it was June, 2004 so I hadn't turned 19 yet.

02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:17.000
How old are you now?

02:01:17.000 --> 02:01:18.000
Uh, 33.

02:01:18.000 --> 02:01:19.000
I will be 34 in two months.

02:01:19.000 --> 02:01:20.000
Oh my God.

02:01:20.000 --> 02:01:22.000
I know I'm the baby here.

02:01:22.000 --> 02:01:23.000
Yeah.

02:01:23.000 --> 02:01:24.000
My round one is fricking awesome.

02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:30.000
They got dance rush a while ago and because it is a Japanese arcade, they continue to

02:01:31.000 --> 02:01:37.000
get content updates, which is huge, huge in the modern, in the modern, uh, trend of Bimani

02:01:37.000 --> 02:01:38.000
gaming.

02:01:38.000 --> 02:01:45.000
Um, so a song, um, there's a pair of Swedish, I assume some European producers cause fricking

02:01:45.000 --> 02:01:53.000
everybody electro is, is in Sweden, Norway, Europe, um, uh, named W and W that have some

02:01:53.000 --> 02:01:55.000
big room electro songs that I really like.

02:01:55.000 --> 02:02:05.000
And the dance rush content update has a song of W and W featuring Kitsune AI called the

02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:06.000
light.

02:02:06.000 --> 02:02:09.000
And I am hopelessly addicted to that song right now.

02:02:09.000 --> 02:02:10.000
I have to listen to that.

02:02:10.000 --> 02:02:16.000
Dance rush has a very small library, all things told, but it is the vast majority of it all

02:02:16.000 --> 02:02:17.000
original.

02:02:17.000 --> 02:02:18.000
It has some super good gyms.

02:02:18.000 --> 02:02:21.000
The first versions of a game often do all of what?

02:02:21.000 --> 02:02:23.000
Nine songs on DDR first or seven, six or seven.

02:02:23.000 --> 02:02:24.000
I was like six or seven.

02:02:24.000 --> 02:02:25.000
Yep.

02:02:25.000 --> 02:02:26.000
Anyway.

02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:27.000
All right.

02:02:27.000 --> 02:02:28.000
Well, good catching up.

02:02:28.000 --> 02:02:31.000
We should get back into our show role though, but, uh, always a, always a delight to have

02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:32.000
you here on the show.

02:02:32.000 --> 02:02:36.000
So you're, we're literally a stop for you on the way to the Bay area for your, your

02:02:36.000 --> 02:02:38.000
all hands meeting, which was described in our chat.

02:02:38.000 --> 02:02:39.000
What that means.

02:02:39.000 --> 02:02:41.000
Cause when you have a lot of remote employees, you bring them all in once a year.

02:02:41.000 --> 02:02:44.000
We have over, over half of the company is remote.

02:02:44.000 --> 02:02:48.000
And while we communicate as well as we can there, it's always helpful to get people in

02:02:49.000 --> 02:02:53.000
person on the same page, high bandwidth to have all of these water cooler conversations

02:02:53.000 --> 02:02:56.000
and all these sorts of things that you can't do being remote.

02:02:56.000 --> 02:02:57.000
And you don't, and you don't fly.

02:02:57.000 --> 02:02:58.000
I do not fly.

02:02:58.000 --> 02:03:02.000
So that's, that's why I was stuck in a, some kind of an animal incident up in Auburn.

02:03:02.000 --> 02:03:04.000
That's why I wound up being later.

02:03:04.000 --> 02:03:05.000
Everything.

02:03:05.000 --> 02:03:09.000
There were like 10 or 11 emergency and service vehicles that cut through us up in Auburn.

02:03:09.000 --> 02:03:11.000
You missed the crap that was going on down here earlier.

02:03:11.000 --> 02:03:14.000
I think Waze was still using it cause I realized it didn't even have me.

02:03:14.000 --> 02:03:16.000
It didn't even have me taking 50 anything like that.

02:03:16.000 --> 02:03:18.000
Just got close and then just south all the way down here.

02:03:18.000 --> 02:03:19.000
Did you leave Colorado this morning?

02:03:19.000 --> 02:03:22.000
Uh, 7 PM yesterday.

02:03:22.000 --> 02:03:24.000
Have you slept?

02:03:24.000 --> 02:03:26.000
Two or three or four hours or something.

02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:29.000
I nap on the way because charging takes a while.

02:03:29.000 --> 02:03:30.000
Wow.

02:03:30.000 --> 02:03:31.000
Wow.

02:03:31.000 --> 02:03:32.000
Oh my gosh.

02:03:32.000 --> 02:03:35.000
I'm feeling surprisingly good right now considering all of that.

02:03:35.000 --> 02:03:37.000
You must be going to say what, you want coffee?

02:03:37.000 --> 02:03:41.000
Bear in mind also the fact that I fell asleep before the end of the show last year when I did this.

02:03:41.000 --> 02:03:44.000
So there's a very good chance, especially me on camera, I'll be like.

02:03:44.000 --> 02:03:48.000
If you need to go sit in that comfy chair, put the mic down on the pillow if you're going to go to sleep.

02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:49.000
All right.

02:03:49.000 --> 02:03:50.000
Well anyway.

02:03:50.000 --> 02:03:52.000
You'll just hear a boom.

02:03:52.000 --> 02:03:53.000
Let's move on.

02:03:53.000 --> 02:03:55.000
We got, we got some more video game news to cover.

02:03:55.000 --> 02:04:00.000
It's great catching up Jason, but we do want to get, I mean, we didn't have a lot of emails tonight anyway, so it was good to use that time.

02:04:00.000 --> 02:04:04.000
Do I catch up a little bit and talk about what's going on, but I think we got some more gaming news to cover.

02:04:04.000 --> 02:04:10.000
So, uh, Loki, why don't we get back into it here and then we'll of course invite you guys to participate with us tonight as well.

02:04:11.000 --> 02:04:14.000
Via Discord over at vognetwork.com slash Discord.

02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:17.000
S2100 Matt says your third wind is kicking in.

02:04:17.000 --> 02:04:18.000
Yeah.

02:04:18.000 --> 02:04:19.000
Probably accurate right now.

02:04:19.000 --> 02:04:20.000
Probably.

02:04:20.000 --> 02:04:21.000
All right.

02:04:21.000 --> 02:04:22.000
All right.

02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:27.000
So apparently there's a video that's out there that's showing somebody running an Xbox emulator on the switch.

02:04:27.000 --> 02:04:39.000
Uh, they're doing this with, um, apparently the L4, L4T Linux is running out and then they're running the, uh, XQMU Xbox emulator in there.

02:04:39.000 --> 02:04:42.000
And of course it doesn't run great yet.

02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:47.000
Um, the video is actually showing them running at about four, four times the speed.

02:04:47.000 --> 02:04:57.000
And, uh, they've got, looks like, um, Jet Set Future on there and Halo I think was being shown as well.

02:04:57.000 --> 02:05:06.000
Um, but it's running really slow, obviously, but neat that they're able to actually do something like this.

02:05:06.000 --> 02:05:09.000
And apparently they're controlling right now with the PlayStation 4 controller.

02:05:09.000 --> 02:05:16.000
So it's kind of amazing that you have, you know, an Nintendo system running an Xbox game using a PlayStation 4 controller.

02:05:16.000 --> 02:05:18.000
So that's kind of crazy, but.

02:05:18.000 --> 02:05:20.000
Hooray for Homebrew.

02:05:20.000 --> 02:05:22.000
I kind of live for that kind of irony though.

02:05:22.000 --> 02:05:25.000
You got to, I, I, I do love it only, only in hacker culture.

02:05:25.000 --> 02:05:34.000
And then throw in a dash of a week or two story of the, the Ruby, uh, executor environment in the last week or two that I remember seeing in the show roll.

02:05:34.000 --> 02:05:35.000
Yeah.

02:05:35.000 --> 02:05:43.000
Well, you know, do you think this is going to add fuel to the, uh, Microsoft and Nintendo are getting in bed together at E3 rumors?

02:05:43.000 --> 02:05:45.000
Well, I don't know about that.

02:05:45.000 --> 02:05:52.000
I know this is all unofficial, obviously that's important, but it kind of shows that, well, if they want to run Microsoft stuff on the Switch, they probably could.

02:05:52.000 --> 02:05:55.000
Well, not natively, I would think.

02:05:55.000 --> 02:05:56.000
That's true.

02:05:56.000 --> 02:06:02.000
All right, well, moving on to talk about something that is pretty exciting as far as accessibility is concerned over in the Microsoft world.

02:06:03.000 --> 02:06:10.000
Uh, Microsoft has recently submitted a patent that shows that there is a braille accessory coming for their Xbox controller.

02:06:10.000 --> 02:06:18.000
Um, not that every patent always necessarily becomes an actual product, but it certainly has a lot of people thinking, wouldn't it be neat if it could?

02:06:18.000 --> 02:06:26.000
Uh, and Microsoft has certainly listened to a lot of calls out there for accessibility and adding that to their system, especially the adaptive controller.

02:06:26.000 --> 02:06:28.000
A lot of people have been talking about that recently, right?

02:06:28.000 --> 02:06:39.000
Um, so this new patent submission shows braille, and it's haptic braille support, so I guess that means it's kind of using the little taps like you might have on some of the newer phones, uh, to kind of feel a little bit more like braille.

02:06:39.000 --> 02:06:50.000
And it looks like the way it is on the controller, it's kind of on the back, so like you might be holding the controller and then as your hands are kind of on the back of the controller, it might be actually tapping the braille, uh, that you want to read there in the back.

02:06:50.000 --> 02:06:51.000
So that's kind of neat.

02:06:51.000 --> 02:07:04.000
What's interesting about that picture, as far as I remember braille, characters are never more than four dots high, although it's interesting that that one only has three, and then the two columns left and right.

02:07:04.000 --> 02:07:08.000
I think it's always a six dot configuration for braille. I think.

02:07:08.000 --> 02:07:13.000
Doesn't sound right to me, but I also don't know braille, so.

02:07:14.000 --> 02:07:28.000
Um, let's see, so also in the patent it talks about, although the gaming industry has made some progress towards improving a game's general accessibility, a need remains for improved game controllers and accessories that address the very specialized manner in which visually impaired or blind users interact with video games.

02:07:28.000 --> 02:07:40.000
Uh, and so they talked about that the controller would have various adaptations that provide alternative input and outputs to facilitate gameplay by sight impaired or blind users, as well as other users' knowledge of braille.

02:07:40.000 --> 02:07:49.000
And I think what's most important about this whole, and I'm obviously I'm saying this very tongue in cheek, y'all, because I don't want to lessen the, the amazing news that this is.

02:07:49.000 --> 02:07:57.000
But I do notice in the patent, the game that is being played has some sort of cat on the stream and it says, want to play?

02:07:58.000 --> 02:08:04.000
So it's like a cat simulator game, I guess, and I would assume that want to play is what's coming through in the braille.

02:08:04.000 --> 02:08:15.000
For an input like that, you basically do have to re-explore how information is conceived entirely, so that's probably like Tamagotchi-esque, like something very simple call and response.

02:08:15.000 --> 02:08:19.000
This is your status information about your virtual pet that you need to take care of.

02:08:20.000 --> 02:08:23.000
So, I mean, I can sit here and go, wow, that's neat.

02:08:23.000 --> 02:08:27.000
You know, we need more accessibility options for folks, but I would really love to.

02:08:27.000 --> 02:08:36.000
And I know we have a couple of folks out there who are blind or other otherwise visually impaired who listen to the show since, you know, it's been a podcast for years and years.

02:08:36.000 --> 02:08:40.000
I would so love to hear what your guys' thoughts are on this.

02:08:40.000 --> 02:08:45.000
Like, if this is something that you think is really going to impact you, I would really love to hear your thoughts on this.

02:08:45.000 --> 02:08:50.000
And, you know, again, we don't have confirmation for Microsoft that this is coming, and I think we don't want to get our hopes up too much.

02:08:50.000 --> 02:08:53.000
But it is really cool that at least they're thinking about it.

02:08:53.000 --> 02:08:58.000
So, you know, and putting their feelers out there to possibly have something like that in the future.

02:08:58.000 --> 02:09:00.000
So, as always, you can always send your e-mails.

02:09:00.000 --> 02:09:05.000
Participate at OrangeLawnTrader.com or your tweets over at O-L-R.

02:09:05.000 --> 02:09:10.000
So, yeah, and ACTF says Microsoft is really cool with all the accessibility stuff.

02:09:10.000 --> 02:09:12.000
So, and Bobby.

02:09:12.000 --> 02:09:13.000
Eight.

02:09:13.000 --> 02:09:14.000
Huh?

02:09:14.000 --> 02:09:16.000
Oh, you saw the question from Bobby?

02:09:16.000 --> 02:09:19.000
Yep. I'm staring at it. Had to mental map it.

02:09:19.000 --> 02:09:22.000
One didn't know how many superchargers on the way here.

02:09:22.000 --> 02:09:33.000
Like I said, considering that all of the meaningful charging, especially across the wide sprawl of the open western U.S., you get longer charge times at each of those.

02:09:33.000 --> 02:09:38.000
So, 30-plus minutes and just kind of knock out, wake up, unplug, get to it again.

02:09:38.000 --> 02:09:42.000
Okay. Wow. I'd be so dead tired. But anyways. But, you know.

02:09:42.000 --> 02:09:45.000
I'm so dead tired. But I'm here and it's happy and I'm settled.

02:09:45.000 --> 02:09:47.000
That's right. We are happy to have you.

02:09:47.000 --> 02:09:49.000
All right. Moving on. Loki, what do you have for us?

02:09:49.000 --> 02:09:54.000
All right. So, Nintendo has apparently shut down their anti-piracy website.

02:09:54.000 --> 02:09:55.000
So, it looks like last time.

02:09:55.000 --> 02:09:57.000
Which means piracy for everybody.

02:09:57.000 --> 02:10:00.000
Yes. That means it's open season for piracy, apparently.

02:10:00.000 --> 02:10:01.000
Obviously, it is very much.

02:10:01.000 --> 02:10:05.000
I like how the website, though, had like an angry face Mario on there. Like, he's very annoyed.

02:10:05.000 --> 02:10:06.000
Like, how dare you?

02:10:06.000 --> 02:10:09.000
Love ROMs is gone. We win. It's over.

02:10:09.000 --> 02:10:11.000
How dare you do that?

02:10:12.000 --> 02:10:15.000
But, yeah. So, no word on what exactly it means. All that we know.

02:10:15.000 --> 02:10:20.000
The angry face was specifically in response to the Commodore 64 port. Specifically.

02:10:20.000 --> 02:10:23.000
Yeah. So, originally, the site was ap.nintendo.com.

02:10:23.000 --> 02:10:27.000
But now just redirects to nintendo.com. So.

02:10:27.000 --> 02:10:30.000
Oh, well. Guess it's piracy season now.

02:10:30.000 --> 02:10:34.000
I think maybe it was more. It probably just wasn't getting a lot of traffic.

02:10:34.000 --> 02:10:38.000
And they kind of realized maybe the time it would spend to update that site.

02:10:38.000 --> 02:10:43.000
Well, it looks like, yeah, the last few updates, press release updates, were like from over a year ago.

02:10:43.000 --> 02:10:45.000
So.

02:10:45.000 --> 02:10:49.000
The key thing is that Reggie was actually running that whole site himself.

02:10:49.000 --> 02:10:54.000
So, when he left, it was done for. That's what really happened, honestly.

02:10:54.000 --> 02:10:56.000
No, I'm just, I'm obviously making that up.

02:10:56.000 --> 02:10:58.000
Anyway.

02:10:58.000 --> 02:11:00.000
Let's move on and talk a little bit about.

02:11:00.000 --> 02:11:04.000
Oh, this was interesting because this was put in our Discord server this week.

02:11:04.000 --> 02:11:06.000
And I thought it was an interesting story.

02:11:06.000 --> 02:11:09.000
So, I wanted to talk a little bit about this which has to do with EA.

02:11:09.000 --> 02:11:16.000
And talking about how the way that they've been releasing games may not be the way they're going to do that anymore.

02:11:16.000 --> 02:11:18.000
Because they're stupid?

02:11:18.000 --> 02:11:21.000
Well, here's the thing. I kind of think they're missing the obvious issues.

02:11:21.000 --> 02:11:23.000
But let's talk about it.

02:11:23.000 --> 02:11:25.000
So, they had their financial results call.

02:11:25.000 --> 02:11:31.000
So, that's a thing that the companies usually do is they have to answer to their stockholders because they are, you know, publicly traded companies.

02:11:31.000 --> 02:11:36.000
So, they had to talk about Anthem and how it didn't live up to expectations.

02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:40.000
But EA did reaffirm support for the game and for BioWare.

02:11:40.000 --> 02:11:43.000
So, they didn't come out on the call and say, we're closing BioWare next month.

02:11:43.000 --> 02:11:45.000
Which is a good thing. We don't want them.

02:11:45.000 --> 02:11:48.000
We don't want as much shit as we've given Anthem. We don't want to see that happen.

02:11:48.000 --> 02:11:51.000
Unlike every other studio in BioWare, anyways.

02:11:51.000 --> 02:11:53.000
It was some of the other interesting comments here.

02:11:53.000 --> 02:11:58.000
CEO Andrew Wilson said during the call, the reality is it's not just an EA challenge.

02:11:58.000 --> 02:12:00.000
It's an industry-wide challenge.

02:12:00.000 --> 02:12:06.000
You're moving from what was initially a BioWare game, which would be somewhere between 40 and 80 hours of offline play,

02:12:06.000 --> 02:12:15.000
to 40 to 80 hours of offline play plus 100 or 200, 300 hours of elder game that happens with millions of other players at scale online.

02:12:15.000 --> 02:12:21.000
So, we're kind of talking about that always online and end game and all that stuff.

02:12:21.000 --> 02:12:26.000
As games have gotten bigger, that system isn't working as well as it has been done in years gone by.

02:12:26.000 --> 02:12:31.000
So, what you should expect from us is that it's not just about changing the development processes in the game.

02:12:31.000 --> 02:12:34.000
It's not just about changing the QA processes in the game.

02:12:34.000 --> 02:12:38.000
Although both those things are being changed dramatically inside our organization right now.

02:12:38.000 --> 02:12:41.000
But it also comes down to changing how we launch games.

02:12:41.000 --> 02:12:45.000
You should expect that we'll start to test things like soft launches.

02:12:45.000 --> 02:12:47.000
The same things that you see in the mobile space right now.

02:12:47.000 --> 02:12:51.000
And it also comes down to changing how we communicate with players.

02:12:51.000 --> 02:12:57.000
Our entire marketing organization now is moving out of presentation mode and into conversation mode.

02:12:57.000 --> 02:12:59.000
And changing how we interact with players over time.

02:12:59.000 --> 02:13:02.000
See, I do think there's some good things in there. I do.

02:13:02.000 --> 02:13:07.000
I do think the fact that he says conversation versus presentation, I think that's important.

02:13:07.000 --> 02:13:12.000
Because that's showing that you're starting to realize that your fan base isn't stupid.

02:13:12.000 --> 02:13:16.000
Yeah, it seems like they're taking some good steps towards writing everything.

02:13:16.000 --> 02:13:20.000
But then I remembered it's EA, so nothing's gonna fucking change.

02:13:20.000 --> 02:13:23.000
Well, we'll see. We'll see.

02:13:23.000 --> 02:13:26.000
But I want to continue on here.

02:13:26.000 --> 02:13:28.000
We think that we're in a really good position for this.

02:13:28.000 --> 02:13:30.000
I think it gets really hard if you don't have scale to do this.

02:13:30.000 --> 02:13:32.000
And so we feel very good about it.

02:13:32.000 --> 02:13:38.000
And over time we hope that we can lead from the front and help other developers and publishers change the way they do things as well.

02:13:38.000 --> 02:13:44.000
I get a little nervous about EA talking about leading the pack when I feel like in many ways they're struggling right now.

02:13:44.000 --> 02:13:46.000
Versus some of these other...

02:13:47.000 --> 02:13:51.000
You talk about, oh, the mobile games are doing the launches more correctly, which I'm not really sure what that means.

02:13:51.000 --> 02:13:53.000
A soft launch for mobile games?

02:13:53.000 --> 02:13:57.000
Obviously I think about big launches like Pokemon Go and how that actually kind of...

02:13:57.000 --> 02:14:00.000
In the beginning it struggled a little bit with the server issues.

02:14:00.000 --> 02:14:03.000
Then it was the biggest fucking thing video gaming had seen in ten years.

02:14:03.000 --> 02:14:07.000
I know it's a crazy idea, but how about we just release the game when it's done?

02:14:07.000 --> 02:14:09.000
That would certainly be...

02:14:09.000 --> 02:14:11.000
Also, with the soft launch, I also kind of feel like...

02:14:11.000 --> 02:14:16.000
Isn't that also kind of where Anthem shot itself in the foot and where Mass Effect Andromeda shot itself in the foot?

02:14:16.000 --> 02:14:22.000
By coming out a little early on those EA Access platforms, all the warts were on full display.

02:14:22.000 --> 02:14:26.000
Yeah, and you know why though? Because EA needs the extra money.

02:14:26.000 --> 02:14:34.000
You see, they don't really have to offer that type of service on EA Access, but that's what makes EA Access a little bit more appealing to certain people.

02:14:34.000 --> 02:14:38.000
But they want the extra money so they don't give a shit.

02:14:38.000 --> 02:14:45.000
Oh, by the way, since you brought it up, EA Access is going to be coming to the PlayStation 4 finally in July for $30 a year,

02:14:45.000 --> 02:14:48.000
which is the same as what they're charging on Xbox One.

02:14:48.000 --> 02:14:55.000
We don't know exactly what titles are on it, but we would just assume that there's going to be a lot of parallels to the Xbox One version of the service,

02:14:55.000 --> 02:14:57.000
where this has existed for a while.

02:14:57.000 --> 02:15:03.000
And they even mentioned that along with the back catalog of EA titles that's available in these games,

02:15:03.000 --> 02:15:11.000
you also get the Play First Trials, hence what we saw Anthem and some of these other games that I'm not sure went so well for EA.

02:15:11.000 --> 02:15:17.000
So I think it's important that they kind of talk a little more, I think, what maybe a soft launch means to them. I'm not sure.

02:15:17.000 --> 02:15:18.000
Beta test first.

02:15:18.000 --> 02:15:26.000
Well, act deft in our chat over at twitch.tv slash vlog network says, basically, we're going to launch games in beta phase and let the consumer be our beta testers.

02:15:26.000 --> 02:15:28.000
Maybe that's what they're saying. I don't know.

02:15:28.000 --> 02:15:37.000
Well, it's because also, you know, these platforms, I think, also have the ability now to do this kind of early access bullshit where they actually label these games early access.

02:15:37.000 --> 02:15:43.000
So they release some unfinished as they do now, but just, you know, calling the unfinished.

02:15:43.000 --> 02:15:50.000
Questbuster in chat says this might be me, but it sounds a lot like EA's throwing a lot of smoke and mirrors and answering the question on Anthem,

02:15:50.000 --> 02:15:56.000
because games that follow a similar pattern like the Division 2 and Monster Hunter World didn't seem to have that issue.

02:15:56.000 --> 02:15:57.000
Good call out.

02:15:57.000 --> 02:16:02.000
Anthem clearly had issues, and the caller was asking about the issues of perception that were connected to Anthem.

02:16:02.000 --> 02:16:09.000
So it is interesting. I kind of like the way you phrased that, Questbuster, because it kind of makes it sound like the CEO kind of had his canned response ready to go,

02:16:09.000 --> 02:16:14.000
knowing that he'd kind of be called out, and it's like he had to get this canned response.

02:16:14.000 --> 02:16:16.000
He had to get that out at some point.

02:16:16.000 --> 02:16:20.000
I mean, I hate to make a Drag Race reference, but I'm going to.

02:16:20.000 --> 02:16:27.000
It's like sometimes Queens flounder in the Snatch Game, like Evie Oddly did, because they have certain things they have to get out,

02:16:27.000 --> 02:16:34.000
and so they'll put it out there when maybe it doesn't necessarily make sense in connection with the joke.

02:16:34.000 --> 02:16:39.000
That happens sometimes with these CEOs and so forth, so it was like he wanted to respond to this,

02:16:39.000 --> 02:16:45.000
and so maybe he took this question and kind of gave this completely out of the blue answer to kind of explain why.

02:16:45.000 --> 02:16:51.000
Well, we see it as a problem with the industry as a whole. It's not really Anthem's problem. It's the industry's problem.

02:16:51.000 --> 02:16:54.000
It's like we had to get that blame out there at some point.

02:16:54.000 --> 02:17:01.000
I made that point years ago on this show. I don't even remember when. It was easily three to four years.

02:17:01.000 --> 02:17:06.000
And it was an easy prediction because of the capabilities that Xbox Live really spearheaded,

02:17:06.000 --> 02:17:13.000
and we now see on every single system, Switch included, that, yeah, subscription updates, all of this stuff.

02:17:13.000 --> 02:17:19.000
No game is ever finished. Ever. There's always something that wasn't accounted for.

02:17:19.000 --> 02:17:24.000
There's always something that they had to scrap for time reasons, and they revisited and resolved.

02:17:24.000 --> 02:17:29.000
Or sometimes it's fun to revisit things. World of Goo just got that update like ten years later, right?

02:17:29.000 --> 02:17:31.000
We talked about that on last week's show.

02:17:31.000 --> 02:17:37.000
I actually overlooked that news. But yeah, I remember playing World of Goo in frickin' 05.

02:17:37.000 --> 02:17:41.000
That'd be more than ten years. I wonder if that year is actually accurate.

02:17:41.000 --> 02:17:44.000
But I remember how, yeah, I realize how old that game is.

02:17:44.000 --> 02:17:52.000
It's not, with the proliferation of services, with the adoption of subscriptions,

02:17:52.000 --> 02:17:58.000
with the rising capabilities of what we have in our living rooms, on our computers, everything else now,

02:17:58.000 --> 02:18:06.000
it's not a surprise that in a grab for time and attention,

02:18:06.000 --> 02:18:12.000
that they're going to make something with more replayability, the entropy of other individuals,

02:18:12.000 --> 02:18:16.000
and stick you in a world with other people and let you make your own destiny,

02:18:16.000 --> 02:18:23.000
because people like making their own decisions in as much as a game allows them to.

02:18:23.000 --> 02:18:26.000
It's not a surprise that we find ourselves here now.

02:18:26.000 --> 02:18:33.000
And so there's truth to what he said in broad strokes. I actually paid no attention to Anthem.

02:18:33.000 --> 02:18:35.000
And I'm not completely dogging on what he's saying.

02:18:35.000 --> 02:18:41.000
Like I said, there's some pieces in there that I do think are relatively woke for a CEO.

02:18:41.000 --> 02:18:46.000
You know, all of these, like the whole, we need to change the way we're marketing games.

02:18:46.000 --> 02:18:50.000
Yes, you do. That's a great place to start. Let's start there.

02:18:50.000 --> 02:18:55.000
So, you know, we'll see what develops. E3 is going to be very interesting.

02:18:55.000 --> 02:19:01.000
EA will have a chance to show how they're going to sell games in the future with what they're doing in LA during E3 week.

02:19:01.000 --> 02:19:04.000
Even if they're not participating in the game direct or in the show directly,

02:19:04.000 --> 02:19:08.000
they've got their own parallel thing going on and games that they're going to be showing for this year.

02:19:08.000 --> 02:19:11.000
It will be very interesting to see how that message is relayed.

02:19:11.000 --> 02:19:14.000
So speaking of grabbing for content, grabbing for attention from gamers,

02:19:14.000 --> 02:19:18.000
like there's only so many people they can cram into a physical space.

02:19:18.000 --> 02:19:21.000
But if they have the venue, they create the rules for everything they want to do.

02:19:21.000 --> 02:19:23.000
That's right. All right. Let's move on.

02:19:23.000 --> 02:19:27.000
Just a couple more stories before we open it up to potentially anybody that wants to call in on our discord.

02:19:27.000 --> 02:19:30.000
So vog network dot com slash discord. But before we get there, Loki.

02:19:30.000 --> 02:19:36.000
So there was an estate sale for someone that was a former employee of Dick Animation City,

02:19:36.000 --> 02:19:39.000
who did a lot of what did you call that?

02:19:39.000 --> 02:19:42.000
I'm just kidding. Yeah, that's what they know.

02:19:42.000 --> 02:19:44.000
I remember that I never had a little animation.

02:19:44.000 --> 02:19:52.000
Yes. So they did lots of like your favorite cartoons like Inspector Gadget, the real Ghostbusters, you know, the Super Mario Brothers Super Show type stuff.

02:19:52.000 --> 02:19:56.000
So they're a part of the Super Mario Brothers Power Hour.

02:19:56.000 --> 02:20:04.000
They had several different concepts that never really made it into actual cartoons, but they had promo art for.

02:20:04.000 --> 02:20:07.000
And these were actually sold during that estate sale.

02:20:07.000 --> 02:20:12.000
So some of the things that we see here, there is going to be an adaption for Double Dragon,

02:20:12.000 --> 02:20:15.000
which was actually looks a little bit better than what actually came out.

02:20:15.000 --> 02:20:21.000
They were going to do California games, which looks a lot of a stretch.

02:20:21.000 --> 02:20:29.000
Castlevania, which looks goddamn terrible, has nothing to do with Castlevania and more to do with like monsters and some kids.

02:20:29.000 --> 02:20:33.000
I was I was just going to say.

02:20:33.000 --> 02:20:36.000
That reminds me of zombies ate my neighbors more than. Yeah.

02:20:36.000 --> 02:20:42.000
And then Metroid with a male Samus Aran.

02:20:42.000 --> 02:20:45.000
What is Jake? Jake Space Man.

02:20:45.000 --> 02:20:53.000
Somebody clearly did not play the game when they designed the cartoon or they were about to make a very, very, very poor decision.

02:20:53.000 --> 02:20:57.000
Can you imagine if they tried to just suddenly make Sam comment?

02:20:57.000 --> 02:21:08.000
That was just but that was like such an epic ending of a game to find out that, you know, this bad ass, you know, I kind of broke the trope and it made the bad ass hero a female, which is which is a great thing.

02:21:08.000 --> 02:21:13.000
So I just like the fact that somebody would have the audacity to change it to a dude.

02:21:13.000 --> 02:21:23.000
I would like to think it comes from a place of complete ignorance about the game and what they're really doing, which, you know, was the norm when it came to Hollywood and video games for a very long time.

02:21:23.000 --> 02:21:30.000
And, you know, funny that we're sitting here this week talking about Detective Pikachu and how Detective Pikachu kind of got a lot of things right.

02:21:30.000 --> 02:21:38.000
But because I bet a lot of the people that made Detective Pikachu probably grew up on Pokemon in a very different place now.

02:21:38.000 --> 02:21:45.000
And there was a lot of, you know, the the lore or what have you that was respected as opposed to changing things for the sake of change.

02:21:45.000 --> 02:21:51.000
So Quest Buster in chat says, I, too, am hoping that the version of Metroid came from a place of complete ignorance.

02:21:51.000 --> 02:21:54.000
I, I would honestly bet money it did.

02:21:54.000 --> 02:21:57.000
It was probably just an idea to like pitch stuff to Nintendo.

02:21:57.000 --> 02:21:59.000
I'm sure that they, you know, denied.

02:21:59.000 --> 02:22:04.000
Metroid probably looked at that. I'm sorry. Nintendo probably looked at that Metroid thing and went, how about no.

02:22:04.000 --> 02:22:07.000
Metroid and the secret of the ooze.

02:22:07.000 --> 02:22:11.000
Given that, that, that boogery oozy typeface.

02:22:11.000 --> 02:22:13.000
Is that Ridley or something? I don't know. Anyway.

02:22:13.000 --> 02:22:15.000
I think it's just one of the Chozo type, I don't know.

02:22:15.000 --> 02:22:19.000
Orange Wright does point out that the Double Dragon one looks better than the cartoon that actually came out for that.

02:22:19.000 --> 02:22:24.000
That one looks authentic. California Games isn't terrible. I don't like the characters are nondescript.

02:22:25.000 --> 02:22:31.000
Considering that California Games doesn't exactly have a huge lore behind it, I guess that would be a hard one to fuck up.

02:22:31.000 --> 02:22:33.000
Dude's on the beach, bro.

02:22:33.000 --> 02:22:37.000
That's what, it would be a totally like 90s, like everybody talking like the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.

02:22:37.000 --> 02:22:39.000
But real people.

02:22:39.000 --> 02:22:41.000
It would be like American Gladiator season one and Malibu.

02:22:41.000 --> 02:22:48.000
Double Dragon does look pretty awesome. Like I would have preferred that to anything Double Dragon we've received so far.

02:22:49.000 --> 02:22:55.000
Alright. Well, one more story for you guys and it has to do with another classic.

02:22:55.000 --> 02:22:58.000
And funny enough, it's a classic we just talked about last week.

02:22:58.000 --> 02:23:02.000
When Bobby gave us that little guest spot in the middle of our show last week.

02:23:02.000 --> 02:23:06.000
Showing you Dragon's Lair that was ported to the TI 99 4A.

02:23:06.000 --> 02:23:10.000
Well, that's not the only port of Dragon's Lair that we're talking about this month.

02:23:10.000 --> 02:23:14.000
Because Dragon's Lair the trilogy is coming to the Xbox One.

02:23:14.000 --> 02:23:18.000
That's right. And honestly, my first reaction was it wasn't already there.

02:23:18.000 --> 02:23:21.000
But no, apparently it is not.

02:23:21.000 --> 02:23:24.000
Dragon's Lair, Dragon's Lair 2, Time Warp.

02:23:24.000 --> 02:23:27.000
And you might be wondering, there was a third Dragon's Lair game?

02:23:27.000 --> 02:23:29.000
No, but there was Space Ace.

02:23:29.000 --> 02:23:34.000
And it usually gets looped in with the Dragon's Lair games because they were all Don Bluth animated games after all.

02:23:34.000 --> 02:23:36.000
Well, it's Brain Dev 13.

02:23:36.000 --> 02:23:39.000
Thank you. Yes, it was on PC compendiums.

02:23:39.000 --> 02:23:42.000
And I'm so sad that they are not bringing that.

02:23:42.000 --> 02:23:45.000
I used to really like the characters in there.

02:23:45.000 --> 02:23:48.000
Is it a different publisher that ultimately put out those games?

02:23:48.000 --> 02:23:52.000
I don't know. I haven't played it since the mid-late 90s.

02:23:52.000 --> 02:23:57.000
I think it was. But anyway, the games have been remastered and updated for modern audiences.

02:23:57.000 --> 02:24:01.000
God, did they re-run it in 4K? I don't know.

02:24:01.000 --> 02:24:07.000
But anyway, considering they're all hand drawn, it does still look really good.

02:24:07.000 --> 02:24:09.000
I'm actually not dogging this whatsoever.

02:24:09.000 --> 02:24:12.000
It's just kind of one of those, like, okay, here we go.

02:24:12.000 --> 02:24:15.000
I thought we already had Dragon's Lair on every platform possible.

02:24:15.000 --> 02:24:18.000
And then last week it was, nope, not the TI 99 4A.

02:24:18.000 --> 02:24:22.000
And then it's, okay, that's funny because that was from the 80s and that takes a lot of work.

02:24:22.000 --> 02:24:26.000
And now it's like, oh no, they don't have all the new ones taken care of either.

02:24:26.000 --> 02:24:28.000
So I think it's pretty cool.

02:24:28.000 --> 02:24:32.000
Now, I would love it if they would bring back some of the other ports of these games.

02:24:32.000 --> 02:24:36.000
There was a Commodore 64 port of these games. It was completely unlike the arcade games.

02:24:36.000 --> 02:24:39.000
I mean, it had some of the scenes inspired from the arcade.

02:24:39.000 --> 02:24:43.000
But the chiptune music in Dragon's Lair was so fucking good.

02:24:43.000 --> 02:24:45.000
I really can't overstate it.

02:24:45.000 --> 02:24:50.000
Anyway, Dragon's Lair trilogy will be out on Xbox One on May 17th.

02:24:50.000 --> 02:24:52.000
And I love this.

02:24:52.000 --> 02:24:55.000
Would you like the current list of platforms that Dragon's Lair is available on?

02:24:55.000 --> 02:24:57.000
Yes, you do.

02:24:57.000 --> 02:25:05.000
Dragon's Lair, currently available on PC, Atari ST, Halcyon, Laser Interactive, Mega CD, Jaguar CD, 3DO, DVD,

02:25:05.000 --> 02:25:10.000
Blu-ray, CD-i, NES, SNES, Game Boy Color, PS3, Nintendo Switch, Nintendo Wii, ZX Spectrum,

02:25:10.000 --> 02:25:15.000
Commodore 64, Amstrad, CPC, 464, Nintendo DSi, and iOS and Android devices.

02:25:15.000 --> 02:25:18.000
They left off TI-99-4A. I'm going to send an angry email.

02:25:18.000 --> 02:25:20.000
NES?

02:25:20.000 --> 02:25:23.000
Well, here's the thing. The NES and Commodore 64 is in there too.

02:25:23.000 --> 02:25:26.000
They weren't exactly direct ports of the arcade game.

02:25:26.000 --> 02:25:30.000
Yeah, I know that was a dramatic down sample that the SNES version did.

02:25:30.000 --> 02:25:32.000
But I didn't know anything proficient in that.

02:25:32.000 --> 02:25:37.000
Brandon 13 did get ported over to iOS, so it's on mobile on the Apple side of the house.

02:25:37.000 --> 02:25:41.000
But that was in 2010, so who knows if that actually...

02:25:41.000 --> 02:25:48.000
Yeah, it says December 1st of 2010, they added support for iOS 3 and 4.2.

02:25:48.000 --> 02:25:51.000
So most likely it doesn't work anymore and it's probably not.

02:25:51.000 --> 02:25:54.000
That's beyond so many architectural barriers.

02:25:54.000 --> 02:25:58.000
Oh, it might be shut out on that whole 32-bit to 64-bit thing. I don't know.

02:25:58.000 --> 02:26:02.000
And it's not even iOS 4 compatible. It won't even have that tag on its page.

02:26:02.000 --> 02:26:07.000
Bobby Blackwell says the Dragon's Lair on the NES and SNES was a side-scrolling platformer.

02:26:07.000 --> 02:26:08.000
Yeah, I vaguely remember this.

02:26:08.000 --> 02:26:13.000
Like the Commodore 64 one, I remember the very first sequence was on a falling platform

02:26:13.000 --> 02:26:15.000
and there was wind that was trying to blow you off the platform.

02:26:15.000 --> 02:26:20.000
So it wasn't like the arcade game. You had to run in the opposite direction of the wind.

02:26:20.000 --> 02:26:23.000
And it was really hard. Those games were fucking hard.

02:26:23.000 --> 02:26:25.000
But anyway.

02:26:25.000 --> 02:26:27.000
Yeah, Dartusius says NES Dragon's Lair was awful.

02:26:27.000 --> 02:26:33.000
But these are going to be ports of the straight-up arcade version because it's very easy.

02:26:33.000 --> 02:26:34.000
The animation, the reference version.

02:26:34.000 --> 02:26:37.000
It's very easy to port that now with Blu-ray.

02:26:37.000 --> 02:26:40.000
Let's play a movie and drop in input checkmarks.

02:26:40.000 --> 02:26:45.000
I love that that type of stuff is fully playable on DVD and Blu-ray players.

02:26:45.000 --> 02:26:47.000
It's kind of neat. Anyway.

02:26:47.000 --> 02:26:51.000
Alright, we are going to open up our Discord channel for your calls.

02:26:51.000 --> 02:26:55.000
So we're available right now over at vognetwork.com slash Discord.

02:26:55.000 --> 02:26:59.000
Or if you want, you can ask us questions in chat. We're open there as well.

02:26:59.000 --> 02:27:02.000
Our chat room, of course, at twitch.tv slash vognetwork.

02:27:02.000 --> 02:27:06.000
If you have anything you want to talk about that we haven't got to yet tonight.

02:27:06.000 --> 02:27:08.000
Did you have any last-minute stories?

02:27:08.000 --> 02:27:13.000
Not much, but there's a neat video of somebody that's recreating Melger Solid in Dreams.

02:27:13.000 --> 02:27:15.000
It's too bad I never did get into it.

02:27:15.000 --> 02:27:18.000
When's Dreams come out already? I so want to check this out.

02:27:18.000 --> 02:27:19.000
I don't know.

02:27:19.000 --> 02:27:23.000
It's been in closed beta. Now it's not under NDA anymore.

02:27:23.000 --> 02:27:27.000
This game is going to be talked to death before it ever comes out.

02:27:27.000 --> 02:27:29.000
I really hope they get that out soon.

02:27:31.000 --> 02:27:33.000
Sometime this year.

02:27:33.000 --> 02:27:34.000
Okay.

02:27:34.000 --> 02:27:36.000
It's coming out in 2019.

02:27:36.000 --> 02:27:40.000
I was going to say maybe we'll get an update at E3, but at the same time I actually don't think we will.

02:27:40.000 --> 02:27:43.000
Because Sony's not going to be there.

02:27:43.000 --> 02:27:47.000
And this is from Media Molecules, essentially a Sony studio, right?

02:27:47.000 --> 02:27:48.000
Yep. Yeah.

02:27:48.000 --> 02:27:53.000
So I guess unless they put out a state of play around the same time or something else that they might have planned.

02:27:53.000 --> 02:27:55.000
I don't know if we're going to see that.

02:27:55.000 --> 02:28:02.000
Certainly exclusive enough. A little bit planned. It didn't exactly go much further than PS3, PS4, Vita, PSP.

02:28:02.000 --> 02:28:07.000
So anyway, I think I do see somebody that just landed in our green room there, so let's bring them on the air.

02:28:07.000 --> 02:28:10.000
Hello, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?

02:28:10.000 --> 02:28:13.000
Hey, what's going on? It's Rama. How is everybody tonight?

02:28:13.000 --> 02:28:15.000
Hey, we're doing good, Rama. How are you doing?

02:28:15.000 --> 02:28:21.000
Good, good. I'm hoping now that I try and Discord on my desktop again, we won't run into any issues the first few times I've called in.

02:28:21.000 --> 02:28:24.000
You sound just fine. What's on your mind tonight?

02:28:24.000 --> 02:28:30.000
Cool. Let me ask you something. This is something that came up on my Twitter feed briefly last week.

02:28:30.000 --> 02:28:38.000
And I just had this confused look on my face of what is wrong with this current generation of gamers.

02:28:38.000 --> 02:28:49.000
Now, let me ask you. When it comes to spoilers, what is the general moratorium on how long you should wait before you talk about spoilers in the game?

02:28:49.000 --> 02:28:58.000
I think you need to consider your audience is very important. Just consider who it is you're talking to and, you know, have they recently had an opportunity to see it yet?

02:28:59.000 --> 02:29:06.000
It's kind of like, I guess with the Avengers, I guess even the directors came out and said, after this weekend, you can talk spoilers.

02:29:06.000 --> 02:29:14.000
Because they knew they had that Spider-Man trailer that was going to come out that Monday that has a major spoiler for Endgame right in the first 30 seconds of the trailer.

02:29:14.000 --> 02:29:20.000
So they, I guess, had their own reasons for doing that. But I think it just kind of depends on your audience.

02:29:20.000 --> 02:29:27.000
I would say honestly, like, also, it depends on if the game takes a while to beat, but maybe like six weeks.

02:29:27.000 --> 02:29:35.000
But I don't know if there is just a hard line. I think you just have to kind of like consider your audience and just be like, hey, have you played that game yet? No?

02:29:35.000 --> 02:29:43.000
Okay, well, then I won't ruin it for you. But, you know, it's kind of like, I would bet that most of our audience probably saw Detective Pikachu this weekend.

02:29:43.000 --> 02:29:46.000
But I think there's at least one or two who didn't. And so I don't want to ruin it for him.

02:29:46.000 --> 02:30:01.000
I would love to talk spoilers, because there are some things I really want to say about it. But I'm just, I'm, my need to talk about it does not outweigh the rights of those who haven't seen it yet to be genuinely delighted like I was with some of the twists.

02:30:01.000 --> 02:30:14.000
Okay, all right. And I totally get where you're coming from. And I understand that. Six weeks? Yeah, I can see that. Now, what about if the period's about, oh, 20 years?

02:30:15.000 --> 02:30:22.000
That's, that's a little extreme. Because I think at this point, I mean, movies that are that old, we spoil left and right, you know?

02:30:22.000 --> 02:30:30.000
Okay, guess what, everybody? Luke is Darth Vader's son. I get it right? I can't even remember.

02:30:30.000 --> 02:30:39.000
You know, the sled was called Rosebud. Oh, my God. Right? Like, you know, those types of things, I think people kind of are a little more open about at this point.

02:30:39.000 --> 02:30:46.000
Okay, so yeah, 20 years. That's a bit much. It's in some ways, it's kind of like, well, what were you waiting for? The plane came down safely, an airplane?

02:30:46.000 --> 02:30:52.000
Is somebody mad because you talked about the Final Fantasy 7 trailer and was like, hey, Aerith dies?

02:30:52.000 --> 02:31:00.000
Thank you. That's what I was going to. This was with a friend of mine. She was tweeting about the fact that there are people complaining about the death of Aerith.

02:31:00.000 --> 02:31:13.000
And I'm just like, it's 20 years. But I get it to a certain extent, because years ago, I was part of like the big, one of the big Sailor Moon live journal groups dating myself here.

02:31:13.000 --> 02:31:26.000
Hi. But I talked about the death of one of the Senshi Minako, and people were giving me crap for it. But I'm like, it's been six months since the show was on the air.

02:31:26.000 --> 02:31:36.000
Also, I would argue sometimes it's not necessarily about the spoiler itself, like a big twist like that, that like Aerith dies, but about the journey that we take to get there.

02:31:36.000 --> 02:31:46.000
And I think especially when it comes to the remake, we're all assuming she dies. Who's to say they're not going to take some massive...

02:31:46.000 --> 02:31:54.000
And I know y'all are looking at me like I'm fucking crazy, but we've also made those same jokes at the same time about the DLC to keep her alive.

02:31:54.000 --> 02:32:00.000
How do you know there won't be something to maybe bring her back later on as a response to a big fan movement or something like that?

02:32:00.000 --> 02:32:06.000
We all assume we know how it's going to go down. How do we know she doesn't die in a different manner? Or they make subtle changes?

02:32:06.000 --> 02:32:18.000
Look at a movie like A Star is Born, right? They have made that movie four times. There was the original in the 30s, there's the Judy Garland version, there's the Barbra Streisand version, and now there's the Lady Gaga version.

02:32:18.000 --> 02:32:28.000
Essentially, that movie is pretty much the same plot. So I could tell you, I'm still going to be polite to those that maybe aren't aware that there is a big twist at the end of the movie.

02:32:28.000 --> 02:32:42.000
I'm not going to say what happens, but it's kind of been that same twist in all four iterations of A Star is Born. However, how it goes down has been different every time and how the movie ultimately ends as a result.

02:32:43.000 --> 02:32:59.000
Okay, that makes sense. Now, to put on the whole aspect of Aeris DLC, now if I remember correctly, when Final Fantasy VII did come to the US, there were some changes and basically, if you wanted to play as Aeris, you needed an action replay to do so.

02:32:59.000 --> 02:33:10.000
Whereas I believe in the Japanese version, not so much. So I could see them pulling some type of plot twist where, oh, she is alive, but she ends up dying towards the end of the game or something like that.

02:33:10.000 --> 02:33:13.000
I could see Square Enix being a bag of dicks doing that.

02:33:13.000 --> 02:33:23.000
And by the way, I just want to point out, because our chat room is kind of talking about this and talking about Game of Thrones, which we all know is the same time as OLR, only one more week do I have to deal with the ratings drop because Game of Thrones.

02:33:23.000 --> 02:33:25.000
The last season has been kind of, eh, anyway.

02:33:25.000 --> 02:33:29.000
I heard last week's episode was not good, but people are still watching tonight for whatever reason.

02:33:29.000 --> 02:33:32.000
I'm going to, it's two more episodes and then that's it.

02:33:32.000 --> 02:33:40.000
But here's my point. Here's my point. I'm not knocking Game of Thrones. Those of you that are into it, cool. I think that's great. I'm really glad you're still here in spite of that being on right now.

02:33:40.000 --> 02:33:46.000
But the chat room is completely right. People have no respect for Game of Thrones spoilers on social media.

02:33:46.000 --> 02:33:49.000
And for me, it's RuPaul's Drag Race. It's the exact same thing.

02:33:49.000 --> 02:33:53.000
I have been spoiled on every episode of RuPaul's Drag Race because of social media.

02:33:53.000 --> 02:33:57.000
And people always say to me, like, well, why don't you just stay off social media then?

02:33:57.000 --> 02:34:02.000
And I'm like, you know, like, kind of fuck you. I use social media for more than just RuPaul's Drag Race.

02:34:02.000 --> 02:34:08.000
And like, it's like, I can't help the fact I live on the West Coast, so I can't watch it at the same time.

02:34:08.000 --> 02:34:17.000
It's not on, I mean, I could find an internet piracy stream, but you know, it's just, you know, you go on social media, you're going to get spoiled.

02:34:17.000 --> 02:34:23.000
But does it ruin Drag Race? Does it ruin Game of Thrones if you find out that, well, I don't even want to say.

02:34:23.000 --> 02:34:33.000
Like, there's a massive spoiler in the first season, and somebody who's known for dying a lot dies again in the first season.

02:34:33.000 --> 02:34:39.000
Most people generally know that by now. I'm sorry if I ruined it for you, but if you haven't watched the first season at this point, you're not going to.

02:34:39.000 --> 02:34:42.000
So, what you're saying is Kenny dies again?

02:34:42.000 --> 02:34:48.000
Yeah, it's only that. So, my point is, is that going to ruin the entire series?

02:34:48.000 --> 02:34:57.000
I mean, if it's a good show, it's not going to totally ruin it. Not that I think you should go around screaming these spoilers at the top of your lungs, but, you know.

02:34:57.000 --> 02:35:07.000
You know, and you're right. Now, I have this thing called spoilers. I'm the type of person where, I don't care if you spoil it or not, I already know ahead of time if I'm going to watch it or not.

02:35:07.000 --> 02:35:17.000
But don't bring it to my social media about spoilers because you don't know who will be, who I follow will see that. Directly send it to me.

02:35:17.000 --> 02:35:26.000
And I understand about respecting of spoilers. Yes, you got those people who will spoil regardless. And then you got those, it happens purely by accident.

02:35:26.000 --> 02:35:30.000
And then when you see people about to talk about it, they give you this fair warning.

02:35:30.000 --> 02:35:40.000
Now, I understand that if you don't want to be spoiled, that you should go off of social media. And I understand from a business point of view, it's something you really can't do.

02:35:40.000 --> 02:35:48.000
But it's like, at what point do you say, you know, I'm going to take a walk or no, you should take a walk, yada, yada, yada.

02:35:48.000 --> 02:36:00.000
Because I know with Avengers Endgame, let's just say there were death threats going across my feed left and right. And I'm sitting in the chair eating Doritos just seeing how this plays out.

02:36:00.000 --> 02:36:08.000
Because I have actually seen people block and unfriend each other over this. And I understand how big Marvel movies are.

02:36:08.000 --> 02:36:20.000
But I'm like, are you really saying that this movie is so important means so much to you that you're going to get upset over a spoiler, and what could have been like a 15 year friendship over it?

02:36:20.000 --> 02:36:29.000
Here's, here's the thing, I'm gonna and I'm going to kind of wrap it up on this and I want to make sure we have some time to get some of our other callers, as much as I enjoy talking to you, Rama.

02:36:30.000 --> 02:36:42.000
I think when it comes to spoilers, another very important thing to do is just consider your audience. Like, you know, I'm sitting here doing this podcast, and I kind of realized, you know, it's probably not the right time for me to talk about Detective Pikachu yet, because not a lot of people have seen it.

02:36:42.000 --> 02:36:54.000
But probably about the time Detective Pikachu is no longer in theaters. I'm going to probably be, you know, those people that cared enough about spoilers went and saw the movie when they had the chance in theaters.

02:36:54.000 --> 02:37:07.000
So now maybe I'm going to talk about it, but I'm still going to be considerate and say, hey, spoiler, I'm going to, you know, even when we do talk about spoilers for Detective Pikachu, or whatever it is, I keep using that as an example, I'm going to say, hey, real quick, I want to talk about Detective Pikachu spoilers.

02:37:07.000 --> 02:37:17.000
So if you like still didn't see it, because you're waiting for Netflix or something like fast forward 30 seconds, you know, or whatever it is, just consider your audience and just, you know, have have five seconds of consideration.

02:37:17.000 --> 02:37:34.000
But at the same time, you have to show show a little leeway for movies and games and other medias that have been out for 20 years, because there comes a point where it's like, if you're not going to watch it or play it, and you still haven't, then you're clearly not going to

02:37:34.000 --> 02:37:35.000
deal.

02:37:35.000 --> 02:37:39.000
Do you guys know the hobbits took the ring to Mordor?

02:37:39.000 --> 02:37:42.000
They made it to Mordor, toss it in the river.

02:37:42.000 --> 02:37:43.000
What?

02:37:43.000 --> 02:37:44.000
What?

02:37:44.000 --> 02:37:45.000
Smog died.

02:37:45.000 --> 02:37:46.000
All right.

02:37:46.000 --> 02:37:47.000
Anyway.

02:37:47.000 --> 02:37:48.000
All right.

02:37:48.000 --> 02:37:49.000
That's it.

02:37:49.000 --> 02:37:50.000
We're going to go to another call.

02:37:50.000 --> 02:37:51.000
Rama, it's great to hear from you, as always, though.

02:37:51.000 --> 02:37:52.000
Always.

02:37:52.000 --> 02:37:53.000
Take care, y'all.

02:37:53.000 --> 02:37:54.000
Hey, you gonna watch the Ingress anime?

02:37:54.000 --> 02:37:57.000
As soon as Netflix drops it, yes, I've been a good anime fan.

02:37:57.000 --> 02:37:59.640
I haven't been going through alternate means to watch it.

02:37:59.640 --> 02:38:01.640
I've been waiting.

02:38:01.640 --> 02:38:02.640
Rama, it's on there now.

02:38:02.640 --> 02:38:04.640
It dropped a week and a half ago.

02:38:04.640 --> 02:38:05.640
Oh, shit.

02:38:05.640 --> 02:38:06.640
Do you know what?

02:38:06.640 --> 02:38:10.640
I watched part of it earlier this week, so yeah, it's on there.

02:38:10.640 --> 02:38:12.640
Bye, my friend.

02:38:12.640 --> 02:38:13.640
Bye.

02:38:13.640 --> 02:38:14.640
All right.

02:38:14.640 --> 02:38:15.640
Let's get to another call.

02:38:15.640 --> 02:38:16.640
I did not like it.

02:38:16.640 --> 02:38:17.640
All right.

02:38:17.640 --> 02:38:18.640
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

02:38:18.640 --> 02:38:19.640
Who's this?

02:38:19.640 --> 02:38:20.640
Hey, this is SSJ1 German.

02:38:20.640 --> 02:38:22.640
Hey, it's great to hear from you, buddy.

02:38:22.640 --> 02:38:23.640
What's up?

02:38:23.640 --> 02:38:24.640
Not much.

02:38:24.640 --> 02:38:30.640
I wanted to call in and talk about the loot box situation that's going on.

02:38:30.640 --> 02:38:31.640
Please.

02:38:31.640 --> 02:38:33.640
What's your perspective on all this?

02:38:33.640 --> 02:38:42.640
So, I think a lot of companies have kind of like done a lot better job with handling

02:38:42.640 --> 02:38:43.640
loot boxes.

02:38:43.640 --> 02:38:49.800
Like, Overwatch kind of, it's mostly just skins and everything, and everybody's just

02:38:49.800 --> 02:38:56.120
trying to transition because they know something like what's being proposed in the Senate could

02:38:56.120 --> 02:38:57.120
happen.

02:38:57.120 --> 02:39:09.120
EA, on the other hand, relies heavily on the loot box stuff with their sport games.

02:39:09.120 --> 02:39:16.120
Primarily like with FIFA, Madden, and I think also with, but also with like with NHL.

02:39:16.120 --> 02:39:17.120
Yup.

02:39:17.120 --> 02:39:19.120
It's called Ultimate Team.

02:39:19.120 --> 02:39:20.120
Yup.

02:39:20.120 --> 02:39:21.120
Yup.

02:39:21.120 --> 02:39:29.920
Where you're pretty much, you're buying packs to get players to build a team, and there's

02:39:29.920 --> 02:39:38.660
like boosted players, there's periodic different players coming in and out, and you're basically

02:39:38.660 --> 02:39:42.540
use these players to go up against other people.

02:39:42.540 --> 02:39:47.160
I swear to God, if you're an executive at EA and you're not working on a contingency

02:39:47.160 --> 02:39:52.560
plan for what happens if the plug gets pulled on loot boxes legally tomorrow, you shouldn't

02:39:52.560 --> 02:39:55.600
be an executive getting paid that kind of salary at EA.

02:39:55.600 --> 02:39:59.600
Like I really think like these folks have a responsibility.

02:39:59.600 --> 02:40:04.000
I mean, you know, sure, they can think about how to milk this loot box thing for all it's

02:40:04.000 --> 02:40:06.440
worth, but you have to have a little bit of fucking foresight.

02:40:06.440 --> 02:40:10.800
And if what's going on here isn't a wake up call for you to figure out how you're going

02:40:10.800 --> 02:40:16.440
to, I don't know, make money and whether that be that you just put out good games or you

02:40:16.440 --> 02:40:20.520
think about a way to rope people in with subscription, maybe, you know, sports things

02:40:20.520 --> 02:40:21.520
go to EA play.

02:40:21.520 --> 02:40:22.520
I don't know.

02:40:22.520 --> 02:40:23.520
There's a million things.

02:40:23.520 --> 02:40:26.080
But like if you're at EA and you're an executive and you're not thinking about what am I going

02:40:26.080 --> 02:40:30.440
to do if this loot box thing goes away tomorrow, then like you kind of deserve to fail.

02:40:30.440 --> 02:40:34.920
Like I know it sounds really harsh, but you've got to be thinking a few steps ahead because

02:40:34.920 --> 02:40:36.840
it's very possible that this could change.

02:40:36.840 --> 02:40:41.800
And I don't think that anything I proposed a little bit ago about make it a little bit

02:40:41.800 --> 02:40:47.600
harder to spend the money so that people are still able to spend money, I don't think

02:40:47.600 --> 02:40:53.080
is as harsh of a all of a sudden these companies are going to lose so much money as as people

02:40:53.080 --> 02:40:54.560
might think when I say that.

02:40:54.560 --> 02:41:00.040
It's always funny playing picking up stuff on on the Xbox with games with gold because

02:41:00.040 --> 02:41:03.440
you go to an Xbox one title get it's mine.

02:41:03.440 --> 02:41:05.240
Admittedly, I have an active subscription.

02:41:05.240 --> 02:41:07.240
So this point kind of falls flat.

02:41:07.240 --> 02:41:11.120
But you're in the you're in the Microsoft store on the Xbox one.

02:41:11.120 --> 02:41:12.120
You go to games with gold.

02:41:12.120 --> 02:41:15.200
You pick up the Xbox one games, tap, get done.

02:41:15.200 --> 02:41:19.360
And then since they still have their 360 compatibility layer, it's always a funny reminder when I

02:41:19.360 --> 02:41:25.460
still have to explicitly put in my passphrase that changes that cognitive load just a little

02:41:25.460 --> 02:41:28.000
bit out of the process as well.

02:41:28.000 --> 02:41:31.880
And admittedly, this is, you know, me, me, myself and Irene that I'm talking about.

02:41:31.880 --> 02:41:32.880
Not Princess Irene.

02:41:32.880 --> 02:41:34.200
She has been on the show forever.

02:41:34.200 --> 02:41:35.200
I miss her.

02:41:35.200 --> 02:41:38.920
And talking about little me and nothing else, but like mobile.

02:41:38.920 --> 02:41:42.800
Yeah, anything I say is going to be rehashing what you're saying.

02:41:42.800 --> 02:41:44.120
Yes, there are parental controls.

02:41:44.120 --> 02:41:47.040
Yes, there are ways of doing prepaid cards.

02:41:47.040 --> 02:41:50.480
So you can't run up frickin thousands of dollars of charges.

02:41:50.480 --> 02:41:56.160
Plenty of banking options for for kids to learn what money actually is when it's not

02:41:56.160 --> 02:41:57.860
counting dollar bills anymore.

02:41:57.860 --> 02:41:59.120
Let me ask this question, Matt.

02:41:59.120 --> 02:42:03.120
And I'm going to I'm going to I'm going to do this with a great thing we do in the corporate

02:42:03.120 --> 02:42:05.920
world, which is don't bring me problems.

02:42:05.920 --> 02:42:06.920
Bring me solutions.

02:42:06.920 --> 02:42:07.920
Right.

02:42:07.920 --> 02:42:08.920
We've all heard that in the corporate world.

02:42:08.920 --> 02:42:09.920
Right.

02:42:09.920 --> 02:42:12.880
So what I'm saying is maybe you don't have an answer for this, Matt, and it's OK.

02:42:12.880 --> 02:42:16.080
How do you think the industry fixes this problem?

02:42:16.080 --> 02:42:22.880
Well, I think a lot of companies have kind of like tried to do like the best that they

02:42:22.880 --> 02:42:24.120
can.

02:42:24.120 --> 02:42:28.120
But I think with like the issue with like, yay, what they're going to have to do is like

02:42:28.120 --> 02:42:33.120
right now, you know, like the little bit of research I did before this call, yay, with

02:42:33.120 --> 02:42:37.640
the ultimate team revenue that they get is about eight hundred million dollars.

02:42:37.640 --> 02:42:43.500
So they're going to like try everything possible to try to avoid, you know, this happening.

02:42:43.500 --> 02:42:52.160
But in the cases where last year there was a lawsuit in Belgium over these loot boxes

02:42:52.160 --> 02:42:58.440
being considered gambling, EA ended up settling with that.

02:42:58.440 --> 02:43:05.880
And what they did in Belgium, all the Belgian players who play FIFA, they can't purchase

02:43:05.880 --> 02:43:08.800
points with real money.

02:43:08.800 --> 02:43:13.740
They have to earn that money in game and they just flipped it off.

02:43:13.740 --> 02:43:19.540
It's so interesting how many corporations and that's why I say like you kind of you

02:43:19.540 --> 02:43:23.580
kind of pick and choose what, you know, what losses you're willing to take to still be

02:43:23.580 --> 02:43:25.100
able to make the money.

02:43:25.100 --> 02:43:31.100
And so many country or excuse me, so many gaming companies wrote off Belgium.

02:43:31.100 --> 02:43:32.100
That's what's happened.

02:43:32.100 --> 02:43:34.380
That's what so many gaming companies, they've just written off Belgium.

02:43:34.380 --> 02:43:38.040
Well, we just can't make money that way in Belgium anymore.

02:43:38.040 --> 02:43:40.180
Just wrote it off.

02:43:40.180 --> 02:43:45.480
And like real quickly, my possible idea for how they would like try to like get around

02:43:45.480 --> 02:43:51.840
this or like try to fix it is that they would maybe kind of do like what Fortnite does and

02:43:51.840 --> 02:43:58.620
have like a rotating, you know, skin thing where it's like every 12 hours a new skin

02:43:58.620 --> 02:44:04.800
will be out or like if in this case with EA Sports games, a player will be available.

02:44:04.800 --> 02:44:12.760
A special player will be available and you can only get that with money purchased like

02:44:12.760 --> 02:44:13.760
that.

02:44:13.760 --> 02:44:18.480
So you don't have to take out the randomness, but just like you have yourself to spend money,

02:44:18.480 --> 02:44:23.040
real money to just buy that player.

02:44:23.040 --> 02:44:27.120
Heroes of the Storm and League of Legends are actually, that's kind of like what they

02:44:27.120 --> 02:44:28.120
do.

02:44:28.120 --> 02:44:31.860
Like you have like a rotating roster of free heroes and they rotate, but if you decide

02:44:31.860 --> 02:44:37.320
you like one, you can kind of pay either the gold that you did a lot of grinding in game

02:44:37.320 --> 02:44:41.200
to earn or you just, hey, you can spend real money on some gems and use the gems to buy

02:44:41.200 --> 02:44:42.200
the hero.

02:44:42.200 --> 02:44:45.680
So it's funny that you mentioned that because that is kind of the way that like League of

02:44:45.680 --> 02:44:50.480
Legends or something works and they don't seem to be in as much hot water as certain

02:44:50.480 --> 02:44:51.480
other games.

02:44:51.480 --> 02:44:52.480
So be interesting.

02:44:52.480 --> 02:44:56.240
And I think that's like the, that's the little loophole that I think a lot of companies are

02:44:56.240 --> 02:44:57.240
going to have to do.

02:44:57.240 --> 02:44:58.240
Yeah.

02:44:58.240 --> 02:44:59.240
All right.

02:44:59.240 --> 02:45:00.240
Well, great, great topic, Matt.

02:45:00.240 --> 02:45:01.240
I appreciate your insight.

02:45:01.240 --> 02:45:03.440
I'm going to let you go so we can squeeze in one more call, but thanks so much for the

02:45:03.440 --> 02:45:04.440
call.

02:45:04.440 --> 02:45:05.440
Okay.

02:45:05.440 --> 02:45:06.440
Sure thing.

02:45:06.440 --> 02:45:07.440
Thanks.

02:45:07.440 --> 02:45:08.440
Yeah, no problem.

02:45:08.440 --> 02:45:09.440
Take care, buddy.

02:45:09.440 --> 02:45:10.440
All right.

02:45:10.440 --> 02:45:11.440
Let's bring in one more call and we will say hello.

02:45:11.680 --> 02:45:12.680
Hi, you're on Orange Songs Radio.

02:45:12.680 --> 02:45:13.680
Who's this?

02:45:13.680 --> 02:45:16.040
Hey, this is PixelPakas.

02:45:16.040 --> 02:45:17.600
It is so good to hear from you, PixelPakas.

02:45:17.600 --> 02:45:18.600
What's on your mind?

02:45:18.600 --> 02:45:23.360
So, um, I just wanted to talk a bit about Dreams and like some of the questions you

02:45:23.360 --> 02:45:25.960
had in this show in the last episode.

02:45:25.960 --> 02:45:26.960
Please do.

02:45:26.960 --> 02:45:27.960
When do I get to play it?

02:45:27.960 --> 02:45:28.960
When do I get to play it?

02:45:28.960 --> 02:45:35.200
I mean, that's the question that's been up and is still not answered, but supposedly

02:45:35.200 --> 02:45:40.020
it will come out in full complete form later this year, but there's no month or anything

02:45:40.020 --> 02:45:41.820
even.

02:45:41.820 --> 02:45:45.580
But what I think is interesting and what I kind of learned by watching some of the Media

02:45:45.580 --> 02:45:51.980
Molecule live streams is basically they're treating the current version that's out right

02:45:51.980 --> 02:45:56.580
now on PS4 as like the game is out.

02:45:56.580 --> 02:46:00.840
The creation tools are basically all there already.

02:46:00.840 --> 02:46:05.540
They may tweak some stuff and fix bugs, but as far as the creation aspect of the game

02:46:05.540 --> 02:46:12.220
is concerned, they feel like that's a 1.0 that's out now, that's ready for everyone.

02:46:12.220 --> 02:46:20.380
What they're working on still is actually a single player mode and also VR, a VR version

02:46:20.380 --> 02:46:22.320
of Dreams, which is not ready yet.

02:46:22.320 --> 02:46:28.220
And I wonder if there isn't, you know, sort of some asset to having the creation tools

02:46:28.220 --> 02:46:33.420
out there in advance so that when the game launches, they're going to be able to say

02:46:33.420 --> 02:46:38.220
over 5,000 games already available or whatever the number is, obviously I'm pulling that

02:46:38.220 --> 02:46:43.200
out of my ass, but basically by allowing people to create and kind of use that now, you know,

02:46:43.200 --> 02:46:47.300
they're going to be able to come out and say, we've already have all these games in Dreams.

02:46:47.300 --> 02:46:50.820
So if you plunk down the 60 bucks to pick this game up, you're going to get access to

02:46:50.820 --> 02:46:52.280
all of this.

02:46:52.280 --> 02:46:55.340
And that's, well, I think they also want to know what kind of things people are doing

02:46:55.340 --> 02:47:00.780
with the game so they could figure out what tools to make to enhance levels galore.

02:47:00.780 --> 02:47:02.780
You get a penis and you get a penis.

02:47:02.780 --> 02:47:07.540
That's what it's, it's art on, on video game stuff.

02:47:07.540 --> 02:47:09.140
Of course there's going to be that.

02:47:09.140 --> 02:47:10.140
Come on.

02:47:10.140 --> 02:47:11.140
Sure.

02:47:11.140 --> 02:47:14.780
Sounds an awful lot like a soft launch.

02:47:14.780 --> 02:47:16.100
This game is going to be a flop.

02:47:16.100 --> 02:47:19.220
That was a triple entendre I just pulled there.

02:47:19.220 --> 02:47:23.060
Um, what was I going to say with all of that?

02:47:23.060 --> 02:47:24.060
Damn it.

02:47:24.060 --> 02:47:25.060
Damn you.

02:47:25.060 --> 02:47:28.140
Um, Oh, I was going to, I was actually going to say hopefully like little big planet, there'll

02:47:28.140 --> 02:47:31.940
be a Parker Posey level cause to this, to this day, that's my favorite level they ever

02:47:31.940 --> 02:47:33.720
came out with in little big planet.

02:47:33.720 --> 02:47:37.640
Somebody did a shrine to Parker Posey and you just unlocked all these Parker Posey stickers

02:47:37.640 --> 02:47:38.640
and things like that.

02:47:38.640 --> 02:47:39.640
Man.

02:47:39.640 --> 02:47:41.700
Little big planet was such a great fucking little big planet was a great.

02:47:41.700 --> 02:47:42.700
Oh my God.

02:47:42.700 --> 02:47:43.700
Yeah.

02:47:43.700 --> 02:47:44.700
I know.

02:47:44.700 --> 02:47:46.900
I, I, I am always like, I miss it and I wish they'd put out another one.

02:47:46.900 --> 02:47:49.420
It's like, Oh, that's kind of what they're doing with dreams.

02:47:49.420 --> 02:47:54.820
I never did play through three so I still could do that because it's in my library.

02:47:54.820 --> 02:47:55.820
Why not?

02:47:55.820 --> 02:47:56.820
Why not?

02:47:56.820 --> 02:48:01.620
And let me ask this, uh, pixel pockets, have you, have you gotten your hands on, uh, dreams

02:48:01.620 --> 02:48:02.620
yet?

02:48:02.620 --> 02:48:03.620
Are you playing it?

02:48:03.620 --> 02:48:05.020
Yes, I am.

02:48:05.020 --> 02:48:10.020
Um, I've mostly actually been sort of playing other people's stuff.

02:48:10.020 --> 02:48:15.380
Um, I went through like the tutorials that they give you for how to create things, but

02:48:15.380 --> 02:48:20.580
I'm not really, I don't have a vision in my head of like what I could create.

02:48:20.580 --> 02:48:22.940
So I've just been sort of sampling everyone else's stuff.

02:48:22.940 --> 02:48:23.940
Uh huh.

02:48:23.940 --> 02:48:26.620
Um, they have this fun mode that's kind of like channel surfing basically, where you

02:48:26.620 --> 02:48:30.340
just sort of go through a level of someone's game and go to another level of someone else.

02:48:30.340 --> 02:48:32.020
You just sort of check out different stuff.

02:48:32.020 --> 02:48:35.220
Um, and I've been having a lot of fun with that actually.

02:48:35.220 --> 02:48:40.380
Just that component I feel is worth it to me personally, just to see what weird shit

02:48:40.380 --> 02:48:43.740
people are making because you know, it's not all games.

02:48:43.740 --> 02:48:49.780
Some people have made like little movies or music videos or some sort of artwork that

02:48:49.780 --> 02:48:53.100
they're displaying and you can kind of look around and walk through.

02:48:53.100 --> 02:48:56.520
You know, Mario Maker's kind of done that too.

02:48:56.520 --> 02:49:00.020
Like the majority of what you see in Mario Maker are Mario levels.

02:49:00.020 --> 02:49:03.080
And of course you see the hell levels, asshole Mario type of stuff.

02:49:03.080 --> 02:49:06.940
But then you have those Mario levels that are like, this Mario level plays itself and

02:49:06.940 --> 02:49:09.500
as it plays itself, it plays a song.

02:49:09.500 --> 02:49:12.460
And I remember that was a big thing in Little Big Planet too, as you hop in the car and

02:49:12.460 --> 02:49:15.820
it will like just zoom through the level and play a song as you're zooming through.

02:49:15.820 --> 02:49:19.260
So it is interesting to see how people kind of use that toolbox.

02:49:19.260 --> 02:49:22.900
And I think, you know, the, the general consensus that we're coming up with here is kind of

02:49:22.900 --> 02:49:27.340
on the head is that the creators kind of want to see what that looks like as well.

02:49:27.340 --> 02:49:31.260
So maybe they know how to market their game a little bit, but let me ask you this before

02:49:31.260 --> 02:49:36.880
we let you go so we can wrap up what, give us an example of one thing that you've played

02:49:36.880 --> 02:49:44.480
in Dreams that made you go, whoa, that was cool.

02:49:44.480 --> 02:49:49.420
So I mean, my favorite things I've really been just seeing the weird stuff that people

02:49:49.420 --> 02:49:50.880
are experimenting with.

02:49:50.880 --> 02:49:57.120
Like I saw this one, just this thing called Rat City.

02:49:57.120 --> 02:50:02.680
It's kind of like a noir themed world with rats who like smoke and wear fedoras.

02:50:02.680 --> 02:50:06.060
And it's not really, there's not even a game, it's just sort of, you're inhibiting this

02:50:06.060 --> 02:50:08.660
exploring person's world that they have made.

02:50:08.660 --> 02:50:13.320
And you could add a game to it, but I thought it was fun to see here is the stuff that people

02:50:13.320 --> 02:50:17.960
are creating, who I assume, you know, I don't know if they're developers, they've done

02:50:17.960 --> 02:50:22.040
anything before, but it's just someone making like this thing that they've always wanted

02:50:22.040 --> 02:50:24.640
to see in a video game.

02:50:24.640 --> 02:50:27.960
And I like, I feel that it's very powerful that you could just sort of make what you

02:50:27.960 --> 02:50:33.200
want, or like someone I've seen, I can't remember the name of, but this person who's been using

02:50:33.200 --> 02:50:36.220
the Dreams tools to sculpt things.

02:50:36.220 --> 02:50:40.300
And so they've made like this museum digitally of their sculptures and put little stories

02:50:40.300 --> 02:50:41.300
with it.

02:50:41.300 --> 02:50:44.900
And then you go up to a sculpture and you hear like a narration going on.

02:50:44.900 --> 02:50:48.740
So it's kind of like a lot of like the kind of walking simulator type things that they're

02:50:48.740 --> 02:50:53.020
putting in, but it's just sort of like the freedom for someone to make what they have

02:50:53.020 --> 02:50:56.780
wanted to make and not have a way to express that because maybe they don't know how to

02:50:56.780 --> 02:51:02.040
use Unity or Unreal Engine, you know, they're not a programmer per se, but they're still

02:51:02.040 --> 02:51:04.820
able to share their art with everyone.

02:51:04.820 --> 02:51:08.340
And I find that really exciting just in and of itself.

02:51:08.860 --> 02:51:12.260
And you know what's so interesting about the way you describe that when you talk about

02:51:12.260 --> 02:51:17.020
like making an experience that's kind of like, if I could make a video game, this is kind

02:51:17.020 --> 02:51:20.520
of like the adventure that's in my head, or this is what I'm going to be making with the

02:51:20.520 --> 02:51:24.220
tools that are in front of me, this story that I particularly have that I want to tell.

02:51:24.220 --> 02:51:31.140
I am so, so, so reminded of an experience that was 25 years ago that we don't shut up

02:51:31.140 --> 02:51:32.940
about on this show to date.

02:51:32.940 --> 02:51:33.940
ZZT.

02:51:33.940 --> 02:51:35.660
I mean, think about it.

02:51:35.660 --> 02:51:41.180
I mean, I realize Dreams is going to be a lot more, you know, a lot fancier, a lot showier,

02:51:41.180 --> 02:51:43.380
but if you think about it, man, remember making games?

02:51:43.380 --> 02:51:47.220
Remember downloading the ZZT levels on a BBS and you're like, what is this crack smoker

02:51:47.220 --> 02:51:50.940
smoking making this level, you know, all those like different things, like getting inside

02:51:50.940 --> 02:51:55.340
crazy people's heads and like some of the things that, and not just, you know, obviously

02:51:55.340 --> 02:51:58.380
like, you know, people that have artistic visions and stuff too, just seeing the things

02:51:58.380 --> 02:52:00.420
that people come up with are just, it's just mind blowing.

02:52:00.420 --> 02:52:01.420
It's awesome.

02:52:01.420 --> 02:52:05.460
So anyway, I am so excited for this game to launch.

02:52:05.460 --> 02:52:07.900
So I'm be sure to let me know when I can buy it.

02:52:07.900 --> 02:52:08.900
Okay.

02:52:08.900 --> 02:52:09.900
We'll do.

02:52:09.900 --> 02:52:10.900
All right.

02:52:10.900 --> 02:52:11.900
Sounds good.

02:52:11.900 --> 02:52:12.900
All right.

02:52:12.900 --> 02:52:13.900
Take care.

02:52:13.900 --> 02:52:14.900
And, uh, thanks so much for the call.

02:52:14.900 --> 02:52:15.900
Yeah.

02:52:15.900 --> 02:52:16.900
See you.

02:52:16.900 --> 02:52:17.900
All right.

02:52:17.900 --> 02:52:18.900
Bye bye.

02:52:18.900 --> 02:52:19.900
All right.

02:52:19.900 --> 02:52:20.900
That was some good calls tonight.

02:52:20.900 --> 02:52:21.900
We're good.

02:52:21.900 --> 02:52:22.900
You're good luck.

02:52:22.900 --> 02:52:23.900
You should come to the show more often.

02:52:23.900 --> 02:52:24.900
We get some good calls when you're here.

02:52:24.900 --> 02:52:26.180
Not that the calls are bad when you're not here.

02:52:26.180 --> 02:52:30.460
We had a lot of some, some nights we're sitting here going, please call us with some solid

02:52:30.460 --> 02:52:31.460
calls tonight.

02:52:31.460 --> 02:52:32.460
I appreciate that.

02:52:32.460 --> 02:52:35.060
Hey, if for whatever reason you were being shy, you didn't want to call in or what have

02:52:35.060 --> 02:52:38.220
you, you can always send us an email, participate at orange andre.com.

02:52:38.220 --> 02:52:43.740
You can also reach out to us on Twitter at O L R. Um, but for now, unless Loki has any

02:52:43.740 --> 02:52:46.100
other last minute stories, no doubt he does.

02:52:46.100 --> 02:52:47.100
All right.

02:52:47.100 --> 02:52:49.940
Then I think we're gonna start to wrap things up here for tonight.

02:52:49.940 --> 02:52:53.940
Finishing, finishing off, uh, what I want to, what I wanted to say, uh, in response

02:52:53.940 --> 02:52:54.940
to that call.

02:52:54.940 --> 02:52:58.940
Um, have you guys by chance seen the director's commentary and behind the scenes stuff of

02:52:58.940 --> 02:52:59.940
ready player one?

02:52:59.940 --> 02:53:03.100
No, I mean, God, I barely saw the movie.

02:53:03.140 --> 02:53:05.060
I mean, I obviously I did see it.

02:53:05.060 --> 02:53:09.580
Uh, Bobby finally made me sit down and watch it and his, his fancy, um, if you, if you

02:53:09.580 --> 02:53:13.480
get access to, if you decide to buy, if you have any way you've been able to see the behind

02:53:13.480 --> 02:53:15.060
the scenes stuff, please do.

02:53:15.060 --> 02:53:20.020
Because I saw like everything, everything you just talked about, uh, with ZZT way back

02:53:20.020 --> 02:53:21.020
in the past.

02:53:21.020 --> 02:53:22.020
I played that at a friend's house.

02:53:22.020 --> 02:53:24.300
I was more a mood mud exploration.

02:53:24.300 --> 02:53:26.020
I'm going to do a live stream is easy to this week.

02:53:26.020 --> 02:53:29.980
I think I kids today don't understand the coolest.

02:53:29.980 --> 02:53:31.820
We're going to educate the children with some ZZT.

02:53:31.820 --> 02:53:38.780
The coolest modern, um, environment system that I have ever seen was in the behind the

02:53:38.780 --> 02:53:40.340
scenes of ready player one.

02:53:40.340 --> 02:53:45.140
They filmed everything with the actors because as you know, good half ish of it is in a virtual

02:53:45.140 --> 02:53:46.140
world, more than half.

02:53:46.140 --> 02:53:50.580
Um, and what they did was they created a, they, they shot all of the footage so that

02:53:50.580 --> 02:53:59.060
they had all of the actors mocap and then they created a crude rendered world of, uh,

02:53:59.060 --> 02:54:03.300
Oh man, am I seriously going to forget what it was called away?

02:54:03.300 --> 02:54:04.300
So shit.

02:54:04.300 --> 02:54:05.300
Thank you.

02:54:05.300 --> 02:54:06.300
Oh man.

02:54:06.300 --> 02:54:07.300
I never really watched the movie.

02:54:07.300 --> 02:54:13.540
Um, so they, they created, they, they created a, almost a literal game using the world data

02:54:13.540 --> 02:54:17.420
of Oasis for Spielberg to act like a director.

02:54:17.420 --> 02:54:24.820
He had a backpack, a camera, a virtual camera rig, VR glasses, and he shot the virtual world

02:54:24.820 --> 02:54:26.780
with the real actors footage.

02:54:26.780 --> 02:54:30.520
So there were some, there were some stock, you know, T poses, crude animations.

02:54:30.520 --> 02:54:36.220
It wasn't, it wasn't polished, but he could take his vision, his director's eye, he could

02:54:36.220 --> 02:54:41.780
take the capabilities of what he's literally spent his entire professional life doing and

02:54:41.780 --> 02:54:44.600
apply it into a virtual world that people created for him.

02:54:44.600 --> 02:54:50.020
It looked fucking phenomenal because you're, he, he, he gets his, he gets his, he, he's

02:54:50.020 --> 02:54:55.380
in a world, he's a player in a world, he gets his zoom, he gets his lens, he gets his depth,

02:54:55.380 --> 02:54:56.940
he gets everything else.

02:54:56.940 --> 02:54:58.900
You know, I want, I want this transition.

02:54:58.900 --> 02:55:01.220
I want this angle for this movement.

02:55:01.220 --> 02:55:05.300
And he got to direct the virtual world after the cast and shooting was done.

02:55:05.300 --> 02:55:10.060
And it's also interesting to think about where is that going to lead future Hollywood movies,

02:55:10.060 --> 02:55:14.140
that sort of way of thinking, you know, it's like after the matrix came out, then it was

02:55:14.140 --> 02:55:16.940
how are all these other movies going to use bullet time, you know?

02:55:16.940 --> 02:55:17.940
Right.

02:55:17.940 --> 02:55:19.860
I mean, it is, it is, it is a piece of our era.

02:55:19.860 --> 02:55:21.940
It is definitely what we're coming into.

02:55:21.940 --> 02:55:25.340
Did you speaking of which you of all people, did you hear these recent rumors about a man

02:55:25.340 --> 02:55:30.780
matrix sequel, like out of the blue, but I mean, the Wachowskis don't have since eight

02:55:30.780 --> 02:55:31.780
anymore.

02:55:31.780 --> 02:55:32.780
Rest in peace.

02:55:32.780 --> 02:55:35.180
So it would make sense that if they want to work on a new movie, they might, that might

02:55:35.180 --> 02:55:36.180
be, why not?

02:55:36.180 --> 02:55:37.820
I know I'd be all about that too.

02:55:37.820 --> 02:55:39.980
I think they just look at John wick.

02:55:39.980 --> 02:55:40.980
Yes.

02:55:40.980 --> 02:55:46.900
I want more piano and all the things we, we got to wrap up, we're coming up on the three

02:55:46.900 --> 02:55:47.900
hour market.

02:55:47.900 --> 02:55:48.900
We got a late start as it was.

02:55:48.900 --> 02:55:49.900
So we got to wrap up for the show night.

02:55:49.900 --> 02:55:50.900
Jason.

02:55:50.900 --> 02:55:51.900
It's great to have you here.

02:55:51.900 --> 02:55:52.900
And again, thank you.

02:55:52.900 --> 02:55:53.900
Thank you for everything you guys don't understand.

02:55:53.900 --> 02:55:58.820
The show would not be here still if Jason did not, um, help in a tremendous away as

02:55:58.820 --> 02:55:59.820
he does all the time.

02:55:59.820 --> 02:56:00.820
So thank you so much.

02:56:00.820 --> 02:56:01.820
I like pushing buttons.

02:56:01.820 --> 02:56:02.820
I like playing with tech.

02:56:02.820 --> 02:56:05.220
And I like, I like, we like hearing what you have to say here on the show, sit in the studio

02:56:05.220 --> 02:56:06.220
when he can.

02:56:06.220 --> 02:56:09.300
So, uh, not only do you do the Epic voiceovers, but we appreciate hearing your perspective

02:56:09.300 --> 02:56:14.580
most of the times when I'm not sitting in my car in 7,000, 8,000 feet, however high

02:56:14.580 --> 02:56:19.620
truck he is and yeah, well, uh, you're, you know, you're welcome back anytime, but I had

02:56:19.620 --> 02:56:22.620
the gear there and I got it done and it was, it was, it was a, it was relevant.

02:56:22.620 --> 02:56:23.620
That's what I go for.

02:56:24.340 --> 02:56:25.340
Well, we'll hear from you next week.

02:56:25.340 --> 02:56:26.340
If nothing else.

02:56:26.340 --> 02:56:27.340
Yep.

02:56:27.340 --> 02:56:28.340
All right.

02:56:28.340 --> 02:56:30.740
I said, I'm starting to, I, I, uh, I got the bottom of the well on all my parodies

02:56:30.740 --> 02:56:33.460
again, so I have to invent new ones coming weeks.

02:56:33.460 --> 02:56:34.460
So we'll see.

02:56:34.460 --> 02:56:35.460
All right.

02:56:35.460 --> 02:56:36.460
I welcome listener submissions as well.

02:56:36.460 --> 02:56:39.180
In fact, I think I still have some in that one email that I never did.

02:56:39.180 --> 02:56:43.180
So probably do, uh, since we, since a lot of this is, uh, is old stuff coming, coming

02:56:43.180 --> 02:56:47.460
around again, star Wars, slanking, Aladdin, all that kind of stuff has arrived for the

02:56:47.460 --> 02:56:48.460
pick.

02:56:48.460 --> 02:56:49.460
Don't spoil.

02:56:49.460 --> 02:56:50.460
Talk about it offline.

02:56:50.460 --> 02:56:51.460
All right.

02:56:51.500 --> 02:56:54.500
Any final thoughts or what have you for our listeners tonight?

02:56:54.500 --> 02:56:59.220
Oh, um, good night.

02:56:59.220 --> 02:57:00.220
Good night.

02:57:00.220 --> 02:57:01.860
An actual night of sleep after the road.

02:57:01.860 --> 02:57:02.860
Take a nap.

02:57:02.860 --> 02:57:03.860
You deserve it.

02:57:03.860 --> 02:57:06.740
Uh, as I say, towards the end of every episode of orange launch radio, please tell a friend

02:57:06.740 --> 02:57:07.740
or two about the show.

02:57:07.740 --> 02:57:08.740
Help us spread the word.

02:57:08.740 --> 02:57:11.500
Cause we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but, uh, if the voices aren't out

02:57:11.500 --> 02:57:14.040
there to put out over the air, uh, then we can't air them.

02:57:14.040 --> 02:57:17.060
So please, uh, help us spread the word, tell a friend or two about the show.

02:57:17.060 --> 02:57:21.580
Um, auto hosts on, uh, Twitch for VOG network go a long, long way.

02:57:21.580 --> 02:57:24.940
I put out a tweet, basically ugly begging for that today and it worked.

02:57:24.940 --> 02:57:28.660
So I'm thank you to those of you that added us to your list that, that really helps with

02:57:28.660 --> 02:57:29.660
discoverability.

02:57:29.660 --> 02:57:30.660
We really appreciate that.

02:57:30.660 --> 02:57:33.500
Um, Loki, do you have a final thought for us tonight?

02:57:33.500 --> 02:57:34.500
Sure.

02:57:34.500 --> 02:57:37.900
I'll, I've mentioned real quick, uh, 30th anniversary of the Ninja turtles game from

02:57:37.900 --> 02:57:39.420
the NES in Japan.

02:57:39.420 --> 02:57:40.800
So that's today.

02:57:40.800 --> 02:57:44.020
And apparently 30th anniversary of the mega drive as well.

02:57:44.020 --> 02:57:46.020
That was on the 20th.

02:57:46.020 --> 02:57:47.020
Great.

02:57:47.020 --> 02:57:51.100
Uh, and my final thought is, um, I really should have done all 18 missions today, but

02:57:51.100 --> 02:57:52.500
my lazy ass only did six.

02:57:52.500 --> 02:57:53.500
What can you do?

02:57:53.500 --> 02:57:54.500
All right.

02:57:54.500 --> 02:57:56.020
Time constraints and everything else.

02:57:56.020 --> 02:57:57.260
I do have a final thought.

02:57:57.260 --> 02:57:58.260
All right.

02:57:58.260 --> 02:58:00.020
I want to rerecord what you're about to press play on.

02:58:00.020 --> 02:58:02.500
Oh, the, I don't, you want to redo the outro?

02:58:02.500 --> 02:58:03.500
Eventually.

02:58:03.500 --> 02:58:04.500
All right.

02:58:04.500 --> 02:58:05.500
Sorry.

02:58:05.500 --> 02:58:06.500
I want it.

02:58:06.500 --> 02:58:07.660
I want it with my microphone and my set up at home.

02:58:07.660 --> 02:58:09.180
And I've been talking about having a new interest.

02:58:09.180 --> 02:58:11.580
I mean, we love MIDI head and we appreciate it, but like, let's be real.

02:58:11.580 --> 02:58:16.100
We have, we have driven that intro song into the ground over probably like 15 of the 17

02:58:16.100 --> 02:58:17.100
years we've used that song.

02:58:17.100 --> 02:58:21.420
So I've had ideas, but unfortunately it's such grand dose ideas that they'll never come

02:58:21.420 --> 02:58:23.740
far as your games.

02:58:23.740 --> 02:58:26.460
Maybe we should ask you, maybe we should ask your kid to write an intro.

02:58:26.460 --> 02:58:28.060
At least we know it'll get done.

02:58:28.060 --> 02:58:29.060
Dude.

02:58:29.060 --> 02:58:30.060
The game's right here.

02:58:30.060 --> 02:58:31.060
Okay.

02:58:31.060 --> 02:58:32.060
You can see there.

02:58:32.060 --> 02:58:33.060
I watched him play it.

02:58:33.060 --> 02:58:34.060
I went around a little maze with a webcam.

02:58:34.060 --> 02:58:35.060
That's it.

02:58:35.060 --> 02:58:36.060
We're out fade to black.

02:58:36.060 --> 02:58:37.060
We're done for the night.

02:58:37.060 --> 02:58:38.500
We'll see, but we'll, we'll see you in seven days.

02:58:38.500 --> 02:58:41.980
Seven seven seven next week, dark soccer will be back with us.

02:58:41.980 --> 02:58:45.180
And then, uh, you know, it's going to be a big show cause we get a week after off after

02:58:45.180 --> 02:58:46.180
that.

02:58:46.180 --> 02:58:47.180
So lucky, lucky.

02:58:47.180 --> 02:58:48.180
Have a great night, everybody.

02:58:48.180 --> 02:58:49.180
Thank you for being here.

02:58:49.180 --> 02:58:50.180
Good night.

02:58:50.180 --> 02:58:53.660
