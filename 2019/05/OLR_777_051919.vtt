00:00.000 --> 00:28.000
This week we've learned that we're only a few months away from going back to a simpler time before pandas, undead kings, and literally half as many levels as now. But until then we've got lots of gaming news, events, and history to cover all of this starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:28.000 --> 00:32.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:32.000 --> 00:47.000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio. Live tonight with episode number 777, and that must stand for something, for this May 19th of 2019.

00:47.000 --> 00:49.000
We're gonna be Lucky Lounge Radio.

00:49.000 --> 00:54.000
My name is Rob Roberts and that voice you hear over there. Welcome back this week, DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

00:54.000 --> 00:55.000
Oh hi.

00:55.000 --> 00:56.000
Hi, how are you?

00:56.000 --> 00:58.000
Fine, tired but fine.

00:58.000 --> 01:02.000
Good. I'm gonna ask about your week off and some other stuff here real quick as well.

01:02.000 --> 01:03.000
Alright.

01:03.000 --> 01:06.000
Alright, and of course we do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice Geeks Network.

01:06.000 --> 01:12.000
Twitch.tv slash VOG Network right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at about 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern.

01:12.000 --> 01:21.000
And since it is video as well as audio you can see everything that's going on behind the scenes including sometimes when your third host is running a little bit behind schedule.

01:21.000 --> 01:29.000
Well, if you know some people would just make their teriyaki in a speedy manner instead of spending 25 minutes.

01:29.000 --> 01:31.000
Well hello, Loki. How are you?

01:31.000 --> 01:32.000
I'm good.

01:32.000 --> 01:35.000
Next time you should ask to speak to the manager.

01:35.000 --> 01:37.000
Yeah, I don't think that'll help.

01:37.000 --> 01:39.000
Show everyone your shirt. RIP.

01:39.000 --> 01:41.000
Oh, the Grumpy Cat shirt.

01:41.000 --> 01:47.000
I don't know if this is true or not though. Did you hear some of the weird things about the fact that the cat may not have had a very nice name to begin with?

01:47.000 --> 01:49.000
Well no, the cat's name was Tartar Sauce.

01:49.000 --> 02:00.000
And the rumor is, and this could be a Snopes thing, I haven't looked it up, but that Tartar Sauce was an elongated name for an unfortunate short name that was given to the cat at one point.

02:00.000 --> 02:03.000
I'll let you imagine what that might be.

02:03.000 --> 02:04.000
Okay.

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
So, yeah, but anyway.

02:06.000 --> 02:09.000
As far as I've known since the cat was a kitten, it's name was Tartar Sauce.

02:09.000 --> 02:16.000
I'm just, yeah, I'm hoping that story is just some weird Twitter made up thing and isn't actually true because that would be unfortunate.

02:16.000 --> 02:19.000
But regardless, we know that that cat meant a lot to many people, so.

02:19.000 --> 02:27.000
But I also encourage people that if you have cats, make sure that you do things to keep their urinary health handled, taken care of.

02:27.000 --> 02:40.000
If there seems to be any type of pain when touching the rear of your cat, you know, they react badly to it or you see any odd bloating, get your cat taken care of immediately.

02:40.000 --> 02:44.000
Urinary tract infections in a cat are a definite killer.

02:44.000 --> 02:47.000
Not like with a human where we can drink some cranberry and be better.

02:47.000 --> 02:48.000
Right.

02:48.000 --> 02:49.000
Not for a cat.

02:49.000 --> 02:55.000
But also, you know, we don't want anybody to, like, feel terrible if, you know, something, you know, pets do pass away.

02:55.000 --> 02:56.000
It's hard. It's hard.

02:56.000 --> 02:57.000
And it happens, yeah.

02:57.000 --> 02:59.000
But midna seven.

02:59.000 --> 03:00.000
Yeah, sure.

03:00.000 --> 03:01.000
Yeah.

03:01.000 --> 03:02.000
So, anyway.

03:02.000 --> 03:04.000
All right. On to happier, happier thoughts.

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
Happy thoughts. Find your happy place.

03:06.000 --> 03:12.000
I want to get to our kickoff topic here in a moment, but while Loki's still getting settled in from running from the teriyaki place from hell.

03:12.000 --> 03:18.000
Let me ask you, Dark Soccer, you've been gone for a week because I know you had some conflicts with Mother's Day last week.

03:18.000 --> 03:21.000
Yeah, we ended up going somewhere pretty fancy.

03:21.000 --> 03:24.000
Yeah. Well, hey, I ditched the show for a fancy dinner, too.

03:24.000 --> 03:25.000
In fact-

03:25.000 --> 03:27.000
There was lobster and filet mignon involved.

03:27.000 --> 03:31.000
In fact, God willing, a week from tonight, I'll be out of town.

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
And when Alan and I go out of town, we like to eat.

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
So maybe Sunday night we'll get to go somewhere fancy.

03:35.000 --> 03:38.000
I'm sorry I won't be here to take care of the smoosh.

03:38.000 --> 03:43.000
Oh, that's okay. He's got somebody else to take care of. One of my Ingress pals is actually taking care of him.

03:43.000 --> 03:46.000
So it's kind of funny, like the people you meet playing video games.

03:46.000 --> 03:47.000
Yeah.

03:47.000 --> 03:48.000
So, yeah.

03:48.000 --> 03:49.000
That's good.

03:49.000 --> 03:51.000
Anyway, I don't know if you know Pesch.

03:51.000 --> 03:52.000
No.

03:52.000 --> 03:53.000
Yeah, that's all right.

03:53.000 --> 03:57.000
Anyway, a big thank you to him, although I don't think he listens to the show anyway.

03:57.000 --> 04:05.000
But anyhow, let me ask you, Dark Soccer, you were gone last week, but this weekend you were pretty busy, too, even though you were here for the show.

04:05.000 --> 04:06.000
Good Lord.

04:06.000 --> 04:09.000
You've been visiting a pinball show, right?

04:09.000 --> 04:12.000
Yes, it was formerly Pin-A-Go-Go in Dixon.

04:12.000 --> 04:17.000
They since moved to Lodi in the Grape Festival buildings.

04:17.000 --> 04:20.000
But it's now called the Golden State Pinball Expo.

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
The first one was last year.

04:22.000 --> 04:33.000
The second year they've got a bigger showing from some of the other – I'm trying to say developers – some of the other designers.

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
There was a big Stern presence, of course.

04:35.000 --> 04:36.000
Marco Pinball was there.

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
You know, they do pinball supply.

04:38.000 --> 04:44.000
We had a few of the other – is it P3, I think, that did the modular pinballs?

04:44.000 --> 04:47.000
Lexi Lightspeed, and they have a new one now.

04:47.000 --> 04:54.000
But I got to play – I mean, the highlight of the thing for me, the thing I was most looking forward to, is playing Black Knight Sword of Rage.

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
And I'm going to tell you this.

04:56.000 --> 05:01.000
If you're thinking about getting a Black Knight Sword of Rage, don't get the pro, get the premium.

05:01.000 --> 05:04.000
Trust me, it's worth the extra $1,200.

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
Because it has the top play field.

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
It's not Black Knight without the top play field.

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
For those of you that have the extra $1,200 just lying around.

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
But no, I understand.

05:12.000 --> 05:15.000
If you're going to drop that kind of money on your passion, I get it.

05:15.000 --> 05:17.000
You've got to go all out.

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
Getting the pro is settling.

05:19.000 --> 05:25.000
It's just like when they say, you know, one of these days I want to get a Tesla, but I'm not going to get just the base model Tesla.

05:25.000 --> 05:30.000
I don't normally like to show my phone that much, but if you can see, that is the Black Knight Sword of Rage that I played.

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
It's a little blurry, but sure.

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
Next time get some video.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
I got some video of some of it.

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
Send it to me in advance and I can put it as B-roll.

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
I'm going to get Tesla the scientist.

05:40.000 --> 05:42.000
Forget this car stuff.

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
There's another look at the marquee.

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
Yeah, it's a little blurry. That's alright.

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
That's alright.

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
That was really one of the highlights.

05:50.000 --> 05:55.000
I did get a little bit of video of people playing it, but my video is not great since I took it with my phone.

05:56.000 --> 06:02.000
I kept hitting the MagnaSave way too late so I would waste my MagnaSave.

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
It's not easy.

06:04.000 --> 06:07.000
The Black Knight tables have never been particularly easy.

06:07.000 --> 06:16.000
Although I would still go on record saying Black Knight 2000 is better, still this one is by no means any kind of a slouch.

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
I love the video modes in it.

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
Just kind of neat stuff.

06:20.000 --> 06:24.000
How many people go to this convention to try all these new tables and classic tables?

06:25.000 --> 06:27.000
As easily a few hundred.

06:27.000 --> 06:32.000
Maybe, I don't know, maybe it got up to a thousand. I'm not the best judge of a crowd.

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
I'd say more like around 500 or so.

06:34.000 --> 06:40.000
That's still not a bad turnout for what is, and I mean this with all due respect, what's in the middle of nowhere, California really.

06:40.000 --> 06:43.000
And there were people there from Canada.

06:43.000 --> 06:49.000
I saw shirts for their Canadian pinball group, some from San Francisco, Bay Area.

06:50.000 --> 06:56.000
Up the west coast there were some of the Oregon ones, some of the others.

06:56.000 --> 07:00.000
So it was a pretty good showing.

07:00.000 --> 07:05.000
And like I said, there was a big support from a lot of the developers.

07:08.000 --> 07:14.000
I also was very pleased to see, despite having a lot of the newer pins,

07:14.000 --> 07:19.000
one thing that did disappoint me was seeing fewer of the protos there.

07:19.000 --> 07:22.000
There was no Big Bang Bar.

07:22.000 --> 07:26.000
That was really what was surprising and disappointing to me because Big Bang Bar was there last year.

07:26.000 --> 07:31.000
For those who don't know, it was a Capcom prototype that they made I think 16 of.

07:31.000 --> 07:38.000
And we knew a couple of people who had legit ones and then the license got released for another company to reproduce them.

07:38.000 --> 07:42.000
So you can find more Big Bang Bars out in the wild.

07:42.000 --> 07:46.000
And Kingpin was the other one that Capcom was doing.

07:46.000 --> 07:51.000
But there were some interesting ones that I hadn't seen for a while.

07:51.000 --> 07:54.000
Of course, they have the classic pinball room right in the front.

07:58.000 --> 08:02.000
In the middle area is where usually the showcase ones are,

08:02.000 --> 08:10.000
like some of the nicer pins and some of the more fan favorite ones,

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
although there was not a theater.

08:12.000 --> 08:15.000
And honestly, we didn't bring our theater because our theater is too nice.

08:15.000 --> 08:18.000
I wouldn't want it dinged up. Our theater is in really pretty shape.

08:18.000 --> 08:21.000
A lot of times if you go to one of those types of conventions,

08:21.000 --> 08:24.000
whether it's pinball or old arcade games or what have you in your area,

08:24.000 --> 08:30.000
a lot of times those machines are being donated by enthusiasts that have these machines in their houses.

08:30.000 --> 08:31.000
We bought three.

08:31.000 --> 08:34.000
So y'all got to treat them with respect.

08:34.000 --> 08:41.000
Yeah, these are not arcade player beater ones that they expect to see something happen to.

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
These are people's babies.

08:43.000 --> 08:46.000
That's why I hate when I see disrespectful kids at these events,

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
which to be fair, I usually don't.

08:48.000 --> 08:53.000
But I've seen it once or twice, and it's really irritating because it's one thing.

08:53.000 --> 08:57.000
I'm not like, screw them. Don't bring them.

08:57.000 --> 09:02.000
I'm all for educating, letting your kids play stuff that are historic and old games.

09:02.000 --> 09:06.000
But you've got to make sure your kids respect the stuff.

09:06.000 --> 09:07.000
Totally.

09:07.000 --> 09:14.000
Well, one of the other cool things with this one is that there were actually a few, though,

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
that I was really looking forward to see and was glad to.

09:16.000 --> 09:20.000
Like Black Rose, I maybe see one hanging around.

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
There were a couple. There were a lot of Doctor Who's.

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
We just got our Doctor Who not long ago.

09:24.000 --> 09:30.000
So we brought Doctor Who, The Shadow, which, I mean, bad movie, great pinball.

09:30.000 --> 09:34.000
And our old one, Spanish Eyes, is from 1972.

09:34.000 --> 09:39.000
I found one that's called Four Queens, and it's actually a poker-themed game,

09:39.000 --> 09:42.000
but I wanted to retool it to be four drag queens.

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
But I wanted to put local queens on it.

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
Okay, fine.

09:46.000 --> 09:49.000
Dan and I just kind of joked about it.

09:49.000 --> 09:53.000
But I did play a bunch, and that's going to get into my games of the week,

09:53.000 --> 09:55.000
which I could go ahead and do.

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
No, I think we're going to get into our kickoff topic.

09:57.000 --> 10:00.000
I just wanted to kind of, at a high level, talk about the expo and so forth.

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
So it's a yearly thing or a twice yearly thing?

10:02.000 --> 10:05.000
It is yearly. And Pinna-Go-Go is still going on.

10:05.000 --> 10:08.000
This one replaced the original Pinna-Go-Go.

10:08.000 --> 10:12.000
Pinna-Go-Go is now happening later in the year in Dixon.

10:12.000 --> 10:13.000
I see.

10:13.000 --> 10:16.000
Which, thank God, because going at this time,

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
now with the rain going on here that we have right now,

10:18.000 --> 10:22.000
it's actually been okay, except the drive to Lodi was harrowing.

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
There was an overturned semi.

10:24.000 --> 10:25.000
Yikes.

10:25.000 --> 10:30.000
But the problem with Pinna-Go-Go before

10:30.000 --> 10:34.000
was that it was in this big, un-air-conditioned silo building

10:34.000 --> 10:37.000
and corn pollen.

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
Well, yeah, but you're right.

10:39.000 --> 10:42.000
Now that the weather is like this, where it's raining at the end of May

10:42.000 --> 10:45.000
and cold outside, which is totally unusual.

10:45.000 --> 10:48.000
Whether you like it or not, it's unusual for this time of year.

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
There was a ton of hail in Stockton, too.

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
Was there really? I saw there was a big...

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
It was supposed to thunderstorm, though, today.

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
I was supposed to go to Davis Pride this morning.

10:56.000 --> 10:59.000
Maybe our lucky episode will get knocked out by the power.

10:59.000 --> 11:00.000
Wouldn't that be a hoot and a holler?

11:00.000 --> 11:03.000
I was supposed to go to Davis Pride today with the sisters,

11:03.000 --> 11:05.000
and we're like, we're going to get rained out.

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
Thunderstorms, I'm like, okay, I'm not going.

11:07.000 --> 11:08.000
Sleep in.

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
I wake up, and it's sunshine for like a minute.

11:10.000 --> 11:11.000
Yeah, I think there's a little bit late.

11:11.000 --> 11:12.000
And then, vroom.

11:12.000 --> 11:13.000
Yeah.

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
So I repotted some plants.

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
All right, anyway.

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
We're going to get into our kickoff topic for tonight,

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
and then we'll talk a little more pinball with you a little later,

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
I'm sure, Dar-Sakura.

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
And then we'll give Loki a chance to shovel food into his mouth.

11:25.000 --> 11:28.000
But I do want you to talk about the follow-up to this kickoff topic.

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
Well, I can talk about this, too, because I watched it.

11:30.000 --> 11:31.000
Oh, okay, good.

11:31.000 --> 11:36.000
Because I didn't actually watch this direct that happened,

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
and of course we're talking about the Super Mario Maker 2 direct

11:38.000 --> 11:39.000
that happened this week.

11:39.000 --> 11:40.000
I didn't actually watch it.

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
I just read the highlights.

11:42.000 --> 11:43.000
So do you want me to go over the highlights,

11:43.000 --> 11:44.000
and then you can touch on anything I missed?

11:44.000 --> 11:47.000
Yeah, you can, because a lot of it was just kind of retreading

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
and it seems like, if you've never seen Mario Maker before,

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
here's Mario Maker kind of stuff.

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
Okay, but I think there was a lot of new stuff

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
that they unveiled in that trailer,

11:55.000 --> 11:59.000
where I actually think in some ways Loki has the reverse,

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
where I think many people were thinking this game

12:01.000 --> 12:04.000
was just going to pretty much be a rehashing of Mario Maker

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
for the Wii U, but with some extra stuff.

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
But when we talk about some extra stuff,

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
we're talking about extra stuff.

12:10.000 --> 12:11.000
There's a ton of extra stuff.

12:11.000 --> 12:12.000
Yeah, a ton of extra stuff.

12:12.000 --> 12:16.000
So a 100-level story mode is probably the big thing right off the bat.

12:16.000 --> 12:19.000
So now there's stuff to do in a single-player mode,

12:19.000 --> 12:22.000
and you basically are rebuilding Princess Peach's castle,

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
and you get rewards when you complete levels

12:24.000 --> 12:25.000
for constructing the castle and so forth.

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
So that's pretty neat.

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
There are new settings, themes, and enemies,

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
which, you know, kind of you'd expect.

12:31.000 --> 12:36.000
Yeah, it's the woods, desert, snow, and sky.

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
Yep, and nighttime, too, as well, right?

12:38.000 --> 12:42.000
Right, they have the moon block, or I don't know what they call it.

12:42.000 --> 12:45.000
That's not the mad moon, mad sun, but mad moon,

12:45.000 --> 12:48.000
or not mad moon, happy moon, it's a moon.

12:49.000 --> 12:52.000
Anyway, stages can also have wind conditions

12:52.000 --> 12:55.000
that are not just touching the flag at the end.

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
That's going to get very interesting for creativity.

12:57.000 --> 13:01.000
That was Mario 2, like legit old-school Mario 2 with the wind effect.

13:01.000 --> 13:05.000
Yeah, so it could also be the fact that you might have to collect

13:05.000 --> 13:08.000
a certain number of coins, and that will clear the level.

13:08.000 --> 13:11.000
Perhaps there is a specific power-up that you have to grab

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
during the level and finish with that.

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
So that could be very interesting.

13:15.000 --> 13:19.000
There's also going to be a Super Mario 3D World theme,

13:19.000 --> 13:22.000
but it's being treated a little separately than the rest of them,

13:22.000 --> 13:26.000
because it adds different things that they are not scaling back to,

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
like 8-bit Mario and things like that.

13:28.000 --> 13:31.000
So things like Cat Mario are going to be exclusive to 3D World.

13:31.000 --> 13:34.000
And even though it's 3D World, you're still making 2D stages,

13:34.000 --> 13:37.000
it's just the 3D World theme that goes with it.

13:37.000 --> 13:39.000
So that's kind of fun.

13:39.000 --> 13:42.000
This also means trampolines and some unique enemies, as well.

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
And then this is huge.

13:44.000 --> 13:48.000
And you know what's funny? Not that I want to say I called it,

13:48.000 --> 13:51.000
but this is what I said way back in the day.

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
If you want to convince a Mario Maker 2,

13:53.000 --> 13:56.000
here's the number one thing you can do that would just change the game

13:56.000 --> 13:59.000
and make it a whole new experience.

13:59.000 --> 14:02.000
Competitive play is in, as well as online.

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
And cooperative play.

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
And cooperative play, as well. That's right.

14:06.000 --> 14:09.000
So both. You can make and play levels cooperatively.

14:09.000 --> 14:12.000
You can also play competitively, racing people,

14:12.000 --> 14:15.000
trying to be the first to finish.

14:15.000 --> 14:18.000
Not to be that guy, but I'm going to be that guy for a moment,

14:18.000 --> 14:21.000
because I do believe I said here on OLR a couple weeks ago,

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
that would be exactly a thing that you could do.

14:23.000 --> 14:26.000
Race to the finish. Be ghosts with your other friends.

14:26.000 --> 14:29.000
Well, of course, because how else are we going to sell you

14:29.000 --> 14:32.000
on that multiplayer Nintendo online pass?

14:32.000 --> 14:35.000
Well, that's a very good point.

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
That if they weren't doing that,

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
maybe there wouldn't be as much incentive to get online.

14:39.000 --> 14:42.000
But I guess my assumption was that if you even want to get the levels,

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
like, if you want to download levels,

14:44.000 --> 14:47.000
don't you kind of need the Nintendo online to do that?

14:47.000 --> 14:48.000
Maybe, yeah.

14:48.000 --> 14:51.000
I don't know if that's in front of or behind the wall.

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
I mean, I guess with a story mode,

14:53.000 --> 14:56.000
and the fact that you can save all your creations locally,

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
you don't need online.

14:58.000 --> 15:02.000
But, I mean, I would think you're just missing out if you don't have online.

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
So, hmm. Anyway.

15:04.000 --> 15:08.000
So, yeah. I mean, honestly, the multiplayer thing

15:08.000 --> 15:11.000
was, like, the only thing they needed.

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
Everything else, you know, in some ways,

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
I don't even necessarily think they needed it.

15:15.000 --> 15:18.000
Just everything they talked about so far was a plus.

15:18.000 --> 15:22.000
So, like, honestly, and I think I got the kind of perception from this

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
from a lot of people on social media is that

15:24.000 --> 15:27.000
even if somebody maybe already owned this on Wii U

15:27.000 --> 15:30.000
and was kind of like, hmm, maybe I'll get it when it goes on sale

15:30.000 --> 15:33.000
or maybe I'll wait for it, which Nintendo games rarely go on sale.

15:33.000 --> 15:36.000
But, you know, maybe through a retailer or come Black Friday or something.

15:36.000 --> 15:39.000
But I think most people have kind of, like, upgraded

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
where it's like, oh, yeah, day one purchase.

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
There's too much shit here I can't ignore.

15:43.000 --> 15:46.000
Like, between the multiplayer, which is going to make...

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
Twitch streams are going to be so fun,

15:48.000 --> 15:51.000
especially if they get the co-op Twitch streaming

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
because I know that's in there for partners right now.

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
I really hope they get it in for affiliates

15:55.000 --> 15:58.000
and really everybody soon because that's going to be awesome

15:58.000 --> 16:01.000
if, like, say, I could team up with Bobby,

16:01.000 --> 16:04.000
you know, Delvin from VG Realness, some of the other streamers that I know

16:04.000 --> 16:08.000
and we could, like, race levels online.

16:08.000 --> 16:09.000
I think that would be a lot of fun.

16:09.000 --> 16:12.000
I pretty much already decided to get it anyway, so...

16:12.000 --> 16:13.000
Oh, yeah. Well, this is...

16:13.000 --> 16:16.000
And Mario Maker honestly was my favorite game of the year,

16:16.000 --> 16:19.000
the year it came out, what, 2016 or whatever year it came out.

16:19.000 --> 16:22.000
You know, that was like a must-have game for Wii U.

16:22.000 --> 16:27.000
So I was honestly all for them just porting it over to the Switch.

16:27.000 --> 16:30.000
The fact that it's going to be a step beyond that

16:30.000 --> 16:33.000
just makes us, like, even, like, hype.

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
I'm hyped. Super hyped about this.

16:35.000 --> 16:38.000
You got to say it right. Hype.

16:38.000 --> 16:39.000
Hype.

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
Bobby Black Wolf's in our chat because, again,

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
we do tape live on Sunday nights at 6 Pacific

16:43.000 --> 16:45.000
right after Bobby Black Wolf and he's in our chat room,

16:45.000 --> 16:49.000
which you can join us at twitch.tv slash vog network

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
and also at our Twitch channel.

16:51.000 --> 16:52.000
You can check videos.

16:52.000 --> 16:57.000
If the audio podcasts that are free through iTunes and Google Play

16:57.000 --> 16:58.000
and all the places you find podcasts,

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
if the audio is not good enough for you,

17:00.000 --> 17:03.000
you can get the video archives with a Twitch subscription

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
to the VOG Network channel,

17:05.000 --> 17:08.000
which you get a free one if you're a Twitch Prime person.

17:08.000 --> 17:09.000
So consider using it at VOG Network

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
and you get access to our entire video archive.

17:11.000 --> 17:12.000
It's pretty cool.

17:12.000 --> 17:16.000
Bobby Black Wolf says, I can't wait to lose all races.

17:16.000 --> 17:19.000
See, he says that. He says that.

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
And then, like, when we play Mario Kart online,

17:21.000 --> 17:22.000
maybe he'll lose the first one.

17:22.000 --> 17:23.000
Aim low and exceed?

17:23.000 --> 17:27.000
Yeah, but then he'll be, like, first place the next two races.

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
I don't know. I don't know what happened.

17:29.000 --> 17:30.000
I don't know what happened.

17:30.000 --> 17:31.000
I'm supposed to be bad at this.

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
Maybe you're all really bad. I don't know.

17:33.000 --> 17:37.000
So do not be deceived when Bobby talks about his skill.

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
Well, he's just under-promising and over-delivering.

17:39.000 --> 17:40.000
That's right.

17:43.000 --> 17:44.000
Yeah, see, Bobby followed that up with,

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
well, maybe you are all really bad.

17:46.000 --> 17:47.000
Yeah, that's what I thought.

17:47.000 --> 17:48.000
That's what I thought.

17:49.000 --> 17:52.000
Tiger Kalan Chat says, speaking of Mario Kart,

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
Team Sonic Racing comes out on Tuesday.

17:54.000 --> 17:55.000
Anyone getting it?

17:55.000 --> 17:58.000
I know we have a story referencing Sonic Racing later on,

17:58.000 --> 17:59.000
but at a high level,

17:59.000 --> 18:02.000
is anyone in here considering Sonic Racing?

18:02.000 --> 18:03.000
Not really.

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
I think I might. Those games are fun.

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
I mean, the $60 price is-

18:07.000 --> 18:08.000
I just bought a game yesterday.

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
I know, I know. I might.

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
You know, I have a flight on Wednesday,

18:12.000 --> 18:17.000
so I'm gonna, and I bought the Tetris 99 DLC,

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
so I thought I might play that a little bit,

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
but I don't know.

18:21.000 --> 18:24.000
I think I might be talked into playing some-

18:24.000 --> 18:25.000
Is there Danica Patrick in it?

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
No, Danica Patrick is not in it this time.

18:27.000 --> 18:30.000
Well, then, what's the point, then?

18:30.000 --> 18:31.000
I don't know.

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
I'm probably gonna be looking, though,

18:33.000 --> 18:34.000
for more gaming content

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
that I can play on my Mac while I'm out,

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
as I finally found, like, a plug-in mouse.

18:38.000 --> 18:39.000
Yeah.

18:39.000 --> 18:40.000
So I can actually do the stuff

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
like some of my other clicky games that I super like.

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
Well, not to get too off topic,

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
but at some point, that Apple Arcade thing's gonna come out,

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
and I would think that's gonna really

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
blow the lid off of Mac gaming,

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
and, you know, for everybody that jokes,

18:52.000 --> 18:53.000
ha-ha, Mac gaming,

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
I think this is gonna be very interesting,

18:55.000 --> 18:59.000
how Apple's gonna leverage their success with phone apps to-

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
Well, what people aren't realizing

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
is that there already were a bunch of games

19:03.000 --> 19:04.000
coming out on Mac.

19:04.000 --> 19:07.000
You know, people don't like to really look at the App Store,

19:07.000 --> 19:10.000
but if you look at the App Store

19:10.000 --> 19:13.000
and, you know, look at the gaming area,

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
yeah, there's some of those, like, generic ones on there,

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
but there were some big names,

19:17.000 --> 19:19.000
one like Braid and Transistor and-

19:19.000 --> 19:22.000
Every platform has zonk games.

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
Like, every platform has passable games.

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
But there were good platforming games.

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
There was another one I like that was,

19:28.000 --> 19:29.000
oh, gosh, now I can't remember the name of it,

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
but it was a typography-based game.

19:31.000 --> 19:33.000
I'd have to look in my installed games,

19:33.000 --> 19:36.000
but I was playing the stew out of that for a hot minute

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
until I got busy.

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
Also, to be fair, when people do the whole, like,

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
ha-ha Mac games,

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
people will say the same thing about Xbox.

19:44.000 --> 19:45.000
People will be like,

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
what's Xbox got to play?

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
And it's like, Xbox actually has a lot to play.

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
Like Halo, Forza Horizon is, like,

19:51.000 --> 19:54.000
probably the best racing game out there, in my opinion.

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
I think there's elements of Forza Horizon

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
I enjoy more than Mario Kart, quite frankly.

19:58.000 --> 19:59.000
So, you know-

19:59.000 --> 20:00.000
I think it was called Typewriter.

20:00.000 --> 20:01.000
Yeah, people are just weird.

20:01.000 --> 20:03.000
People are going to say what they're going to say.

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
Oh, Pixel Pacas is agreeing with you.

20:05.000 --> 20:06.000
Typewriter.

20:06.000 --> 20:07.000
That was it.

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
That was super, super fun.

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
But also that other game that I liked a whole lot,

20:11.000 --> 20:12.000
the-

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
Oh, God, now I can't remember the name of any of the games

20:14.000 --> 20:15.000
I was playing that I super-

20:15.000 --> 20:16.000
like Fractal.

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
Fractal make blooms, not war.

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
That game is pretty.

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
And the music is great in it.

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
It looks more of an ambient thing,

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
but it's a highly addictive game,

20:26.000 --> 20:29.000
and I really wish that had taken off a lot better with other people.

20:29.000 --> 20:30.000
Yeah.

20:30.000 --> 20:31.000
Anyway, I do want to mention,

20:31.000 --> 20:33.000
before we get into our gaming weeks

20:33.000 --> 20:34.000
and move on with the rest of the show, though,

20:34.000 --> 20:37.000
there was kind of like a follow-up to this as well.

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
Something to do with, I guess,

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
a way to entice more people to jump in

20:41.000 --> 20:44.000
and buy this game on the first day, right, Loki?

20:44.000 --> 20:47.000
Yeah, since we don't do discounts,

20:47.000 --> 20:53.000
but you can buy this thing that's like a ticket to two games,

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
and it's only $99.99,

20:55.000 --> 20:58.000
so you're really saving $10 on each game.

20:58.000 --> 21:01.000
Well, potentially saving $10 on each game

21:01.000 --> 21:05.000
because some of the games it includes are already $50,

21:05.000 --> 21:09.000
so no savings there, but you-

21:09.000 --> 21:12.000
You have to really strategically plan out what you're going to buy.

21:12.000 --> 21:16.000
Yeah, you have to pick two $60 games if you want to save some money,

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
and so you can use that.

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
They said, well, you can use it for Zelda,

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
and you can pre-order Mario Maker 2.

21:22.000 --> 21:23.000
I already have Zelda.

21:23.000 --> 21:24.000
Exactly, I already have Zelda 2.

21:24.000 --> 21:27.000
So are they going to extend it to any other future releases?

21:27.000 --> 21:30.000
Can I hang onto it when Animal Crossing comes out,

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
or is it something where I have to use it by a certain day?

21:32.000 --> 21:35.000
Well, you have to use it, I think, within a year.

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
Okay, so there's a good chance

21:37.000 --> 21:40.000
that Animal Crossing will be a holiday game,

21:40.000 --> 21:44.000
and so if I buy that now, I can kind of sit on it and use it for Animal Crossing,

21:44.000 --> 21:48.000
but at the same time, that means I'm dropping 50 bucks for Animal Crossing

21:48.000 --> 21:51.000
six months in advance or so, right?

21:51.000 --> 21:53.000
Yes.

21:53.000 --> 21:54.000
That's what I thought.

21:54.000 --> 21:57.000
Although, granted, I'm super more excited about Animal Crossing

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
than I am about Mario Maker.

21:59.000 --> 22:01.000
Everybody's got their different things that they're hyped about.

22:01.000 --> 22:03.000
I understand, so-

22:03.000 --> 22:05.000
And wait till after E3.

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
If you can believe it, so we're not here next week.

22:07.000 --> 22:09.000
OLR is going to be off for the Memorial Day weekend

22:09.000 --> 22:12.000
because both Dark Sakura and myself are going to be out of town at different events,

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
so we've been saying that for weeks now,

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
so we're not going to be here next week.

22:16.000 --> 22:20.000
When we come back that Sunday, that's the week leading into E3.

22:20.000 --> 22:24.000
It's not the night that press conferences just straight-up interrupt our show,

22:24.000 --> 22:28.000
but it's the week before, so I would say we're about what?

22:28.000 --> 22:29.000
So that's one, two, three.

22:29.000 --> 22:34.000
We're three weeks away, Dark Sakura, from knowing about Animal Crossing,

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
assuming that is Nintendo's big reveal this year.

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
I have my pre-order.

22:38.000 --> 22:44.000
I actually went to the Game Stops because, what was I buying?

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
I was buying something at the time.

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
Oh, yeah, I was buying Dan's Red Dead for his birthday,

22:48.000 --> 22:52.000
so this was back in November, and I was just talking about Animal Crossing.

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
We've got pre-orders for it.

22:54.000 --> 22:55.000
I'm like, yeah, what's your release date?

22:55.000 --> 22:57.000
Laugh, laugh, January.

22:57.000 --> 22:58.000
I'm like, yeah, that's not going to happen.

22:58.000 --> 22:59.000
I don't know.

22:59.000 --> 23:03.000
Bobby's razzing you for caving in and using the word pre-order.

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
Well, whatever.

23:06.000 --> 23:09.000
At some point, it's what the industry calls it.

23:09.000 --> 23:10.000
You just have to accept it.

23:10.000 --> 23:11.000
It's a pre-purchase.

23:11.000 --> 23:12.000
I'm quoting.

23:12.000 --> 23:13.000
Yeah, you're quoting.

23:13.000 --> 23:14.000
I'm quoting.

23:14.000 --> 23:15.000
Okay.

23:15.000 --> 23:21.000
That's why she's saying sick under her breath after a sick, sick.

23:21.000 --> 23:24.000
I prefer when they called it reservations.

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
Well, if you want to be technical about it, okay?

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
I don't. I really don't.

23:28.000 --> 23:31.000
We're just going to make it so that it's correct, okay?

23:31.000 --> 23:32.000
Okay, George Carlin.

23:32.000 --> 23:38.000
So a pre-order is you're placing the order before the store actually places the order with the publisher.

23:38.000 --> 23:41.000
So technically, you're ordering it before they order it.

23:41.000 --> 23:43.000
So it is a pre-order.

23:43.000 --> 23:45.000
The order is coming in before they order it.

23:45.000 --> 23:50.000
No, because you are putting in the order and they are forwarding the order.

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
So if anything, it would be a forwarded order.

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
I was trying to help you out here, but fine.

23:54.000 --> 23:55.000
No.

23:55.000 --> 23:56.000
You know what?

23:56.000 --> 23:57.000
You're wrong.

23:57.000 --> 23:59.000
I'm the semantics queen.

23:59.000 --> 24:00.000
At any rate.

24:00.000 --> 24:03.000
If we preempt this conversation to talk about literally anything else.

24:03.000 --> 24:05.000
I prefer reservation.

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
I have reservations about this show right now.

24:07.000 --> 24:09.000
Moving on.

24:09.000 --> 24:10.000
Girl.

24:10.000 --> 24:14.000
We are going to get into a segment talking about our gaming weeks.

24:14.000 --> 24:18.000
So let's talk a little bit about what types of games we have been playing this week.

24:18.000 --> 24:21.000
And I think we can all grammatically agree with that statement.

24:21.000 --> 24:23.000
How is your gaming week, Dark Sakura?

24:23.000 --> 24:24.000
What have you been playing?

24:24.000 --> 24:25.000
Good lord.

24:25.000 --> 24:26.000
All right.

24:26.000 --> 24:29.000
I have to look at my phone because I took pictures of everything I played.

24:29.000 --> 24:30.000
Okay.

24:30.000 --> 24:31.000
We don't have to have the entire laundry list.

24:31.000 --> 24:32.000
Yes, I do.

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
Because most people out there are going to be like, I don't know these tables.

24:34.000 --> 24:35.000
Yes, I do.

24:35.000 --> 24:36.000
You played a lot of pinball.

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
I played Black Knight Sword of Rage.

24:38.000 --> 24:41.000
Well, I am going to talk about the notable ones.

24:41.000 --> 24:42.000
They had a Pac-Man pinball.

24:42.000 --> 24:45.000
They're not baby Pac-Man, but the Pac-Man table.

24:45.000 --> 24:46.000
Oh, yeah.

24:46.000 --> 24:47.000
I've seen the Pac-Man table.

24:47.000 --> 24:48.000
Oh, man.

24:48.000 --> 24:49.000
They didn't have a baby Pac-Man, though.

24:49.000 --> 24:50.000
That's my favorite.

24:50.000 --> 24:56.000
They had the Beatlemania table, which is a remake of a 60s pinball, but with modern tools

24:56.000 --> 25:01.000
like magnetic catches and different triggers and different story modes and everything in

25:01.000 --> 25:02.000
the full video display.

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
It was really cool.

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
I had no idea they made a pinball table out of the Beatles.

25:06.000 --> 25:11.000
Well, there was the old one back in the day, but yeah, this one's a remake of the old one.

25:11.000 --> 25:16.000
I played one called Fire, which is basically just a town on fire.

25:16.000 --> 25:23.000
I played Ripley's Believe It or Not, but the best one ever was this one called Nightmoves.

25:23.000 --> 25:29.000
The music is like 1982 threw up all over everything, and the display is right in the middle of it.

25:29.000 --> 25:30.000
It's this flat one.

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
They also had the joust, which is the versus.

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
They did a joust pinball machine?

25:34.000 --> 25:38.000
Yeah, and I'm going to see if, again, anyone can see that.

25:38.000 --> 25:39.000
Your phone pictures don't go very well.

25:39.000 --> 25:45.000
Yeah, but anyway, it is a slanted table.

25:45.000 --> 25:47.000
You see this chat?

25:47.000 --> 25:48.000
Yeah.

25:49.000 --> 25:56.000
It's upraised in the center, but you play and you kick the balls back and forth.

25:56.000 --> 26:00.000
Kind of, I guess, like skee-ballish versus, you know.

26:00.000 --> 26:03.000
I played a bunch of the super old ones.

26:03.000 --> 26:09.000
I was kind of actually disappointed not to find a Captain Fantastic, but I did play Willy Wonka

26:09.000 --> 26:15.000
in the Chocolate Factory, but like I said leading up from Bobby is that they had it

26:15.000 --> 26:20.000
for two balls per play and no ball save.

26:20.000 --> 26:24.000
The games were over really quick unless you just were really amazing at it.

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
But you weren't having to actually pay money to play all these games, right?

26:26.000 --> 26:27.000
No.

26:27.000 --> 26:28.000
They were all in free play anyway.

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
They were all in free play.

26:30.000 --> 26:33.000
I played a little Deadpool.

26:33.000 --> 26:34.000
I still think Deadpool is great.

26:34.000 --> 26:38.000
My husband's not as big of a fan of it, but one thing that made me happy is that they

26:38.000 --> 26:42.000
actually had a Black Knight, a Black Knight 2000, and a Black Knight Sword of Rage all

26:42.000 --> 26:43.000
by each other.

26:43.000 --> 26:44.000
So I had to go through.

26:44.000 --> 26:45.000
Now the Big Lebowski.

26:45.000 --> 26:46.000
They had a Big Lebowski there.

26:46.000 --> 26:49.000
And I don't know if you know about the drama of this.

26:49.000 --> 26:53.000
It was a company created and they were going to do the Big Lebowski table.

26:53.000 --> 26:55.000
And it's a really nice table.

26:55.000 --> 27:01.000
They had enough orders to do like five or six hundred of them and only produced 300

27:01.000 --> 27:02.000
tables.

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
So yeah, people were pissed.

27:04.000 --> 27:08.000
But that also means that this table is like super rare.

27:08.000 --> 27:12.000
So, I mean, maybe not as rare as Big Bang Bar was, you know, back in the day.

27:12.000 --> 27:13.000
But it was pretty rare.

27:13.000 --> 27:14.000
It was really fun, too.

27:14.000 --> 27:17.000
You know, and I played a Tron.

27:17.000 --> 27:18.000
I love the Tron table.

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
It's so pretty.

27:20.000 --> 27:21.000
It's Tron Legacy, technically.

27:21.000 --> 27:22.000
Tron Legacy, yeah.

27:22.000 --> 27:26.000
And they had a Houdini, which I finally got a chance to play Houdini.

27:26.000 --> 27:27.000
And it's OK.

27:27.000 --> 27:30.000
They did another one, the same company.

27:30.000 --> 27:31.000
It's crap.

27:31.000 --> 27:33.000
It's not Jersey Jack because Jersey Jack did.

27:33.000 --> 27:36.000
No, it's American Pinball Company, one of the newer ones.

27:36.000 --> 27:41.000
But they did Houdini and then they did a new one, which is Oktoberfest, which I wasn't

27:41.000 --> 27:42.000
too into playing.

27:42.000 --> 27:49.000
You know, it had like just this big, you know, theme of beer, which I have no problem with.

27:49.000 --> 27:54.000
And then, you know, I went that was on Friday when I went back.

27:54.000 --> 27:58.000
I have a lot of pictures of Miss Vanjie and Brooklyn Heights.

27:58.000 --> 27:59.000
Is she there?

27:59.000 --> 28:00.000
I had to go through my phone.

28:00.000 --> 28:01.000
No.

28:01.000 --> 28:02.000
Was she there?

28:02.000 --> 28:03.000
No, just because they're beautiful.

28:03.000 --> 28:09.000
So I also played Space Shuttle, which is kind of one of those middle era ones.

28:09.000 --> 28:10.000
Strange Science.

28:10.000 --> 28:11.000
Rocky and Bull Inkel.

28:11.000 --> 28:12.000
They had a Rocky and Bull Inkel.

28:12.000 --> 28:13.000
You know, I used to own one.

28:13.000 --> 28:14.000
Yeah, yeah.

28:14.000 --> 28:15.000
I remember playing that table at your house.

28:15.000 --> 28:16.000
Strange Science.

28:16.000 --> 28:17.000
Is that like a knockoff weird science?

28:17.000 --> 28:20.000
I think it actually predates weird science.

28:20.000 --> 28:23.000
But it's kind of different themed.

28:23.000 --> 28:26.000
It doesn't have like the make a girl in your garage thing, you know.

28:26.000 --> 28:30.000
But Rocky and Bull Inkel, for those who don't know, this was actually one of the first pinballs

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
Dan and I owned.

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
And it has an Easter egg in it.

28:34.000 --> 28:42.000
If you look by where Mr. Peabody is standing by the Wayback Machine, there's a DeLorean

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
coming out from it behind him.

28:44.000 --> 28:47.000
So, you know, little things are there.

28:47.000 --> 28:51.000
There's Roller Games played Wizard of Oz, which is another one of those Jersey Jack

28:51.000 --> 28:52.000
tables.

28:52.000 --> 28:53.000
So is Wonka.

28:53.000 --> 28:54.000
Wonka's one of the Jersey Jack tables.

28:54.000 --> 28:59.000
I think Beatlemania was also, no, it wasn't reproduced by Jersey Jack.

28:59.000 --> 29:02.000
You know, they had Cyclone and some of those other ones.

29:02.000 --> 29:05.000
That's America's Most Haunted, which I think was the only one done by that.

29:05.000 --> 29:08.000
They had a dialed in, which is, of course, another Jersey Jack.

29:08.000 --> 29:11.000
The Jersey Jack tables are pricey, but they also had the Munsters.

29:11.000 --> 29:14.000
Did you know that that had been a recent one?

29:14.000 --> 29:17.000
You had mentioned it at like whatever the last pinball thing was that you went to.

29:17.000 --> 29:18.000
They didn't have it.

29:18.000 --> 29:19.000
It wasn't out then.

29:19.000 --> 29:20.000
I remember.

29:20.000 --> 29:21.000
I remember hearing about it.

29:21.000 --> 29:24.000
Oh, you know, I have a friend on Facebook who's super into pinball as well.

29:24.000 --> 29:28.000
So I knew from my Rocky horror days in San Francisco, she's super into pinball, too.

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
So I think maybe she had posted about it.

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
She's probably at the same show, to be quite honest.

29:32.000 --> 29:33.000
Okay.

29:33.000 --> 29:39.000
Well, one of the neat things, though, about Munsters pinball is that you can get like Grandpa's lab as a mode.

29:39.000 --> 29:46.000
And there is this kind of oval shaped insert in the bottom of it with teeny, teeny, teeny pinball.

29:46.000 --> 29:52.000
Like the flippers are like a third the size of the normal flipper in the balls, like a little teeny, teeny pinball.

29:52.000 --> 29:55.000
And you've got like traps and catches and stuff in there.

29:55.000 --> 29:57.000
It's actually super fun.

29:57.000 --> 29:59.000
It's adorable.

29:59.000 --> 30:02.000
But, you know, those were really the big names there.

30:02.000 --> 30:03.000
Of course, you know, I played the Black Rose.

30:03.000 --> 30:08.000
I think I played, though, that Knight moves a crap ton just because the music was so enamoring.

30:08.000 --> 30:13.000
But the other thing for me, there was an Avatar, which is not fun.

30:13.000 --> 30:14.000
Elvis, not fun.

30:14.000 --> 30:17.000
Star Wars, pretty fun, because that's also one of Steve Ritchie's.

30:17.000 --> 30:19.000
But I had to play roller games because that's an early Steve Ritchie.

30:19.000 --> 30:21.000
And, of course, all the Black Knights.

30:21.000 --> 30:23.000
There's the X-Men pinball, which is okay.

30:23.000 --> 30:27.000
Now, here is me getting into some gripes about some of the newer ones.

30:27.000 --> 30:32.000
I really want to love the is it P3 or P4?

30:32.000 --> 30:33.000
I have to look at the name again.

30:33.000 --> 30:38.000
They're modular tables, so they're meant that you they have a big video screen on the play field.

30:38.000 --> 30:46.000
And then you put in different ramps and different arrangements based on what game you're going to have loaded on the on the ROM board.

30:46.000 --> 30:49.000
And so Lexi Light Speed was their first one.

30:49.000 --> 30:50.000
And it's fun.

30:50.000 --> 30:55.000
You know, it's got like a carousel thing to catch your balls from multiball.

30:55.000 --> 30:57.000
And you can have, I think, like a 10 multiball thing.

30:57.000 --> 30:59.000
It's pretty intense.

30:59.000 --> 31:00.000
It was really fun.

31:00.000 --> 31:03.000
But this other one that was called.

31:03.000 --> 31:05.000
I have to get the name of it.

31:05.000 --> 31:06.000
Cannon Lagoon.

31:06.000 --> 31:07.000
It's stupid.

31:07.000 --> 31:12.000
I mean, it's like two ramps and three targets and a video screen in the background.

31:12.000 --> 31:16.000
And all you do is just try to throw the cannonball at a ship.

31:16.000 --> 31:17.000
It's boring.

31:17.000 --> 31:23.000
And like you have like so many balls that balls that you can throw at them.

31:23.000 --> 31:26.000
So really, I wasn't.

31:26.000 --> 31:31.000
That was probably the least the most disappointing thing I played was that one.

31:31.000 --> 31:33.000
But I mean, I love monsters.

31:33.000 --> 31:34.000
Black Knight.

31:34.000 --> 31:35.000
Oh, my God.

31:35.000 --> 31:39.000
I think I I might have lost my shit a couple of times playing it.

31:39.000 --> 31:40.000
Is it only pinball at this?

31:40.000 --> 31:46.000
I know it might sound like a stupid question, but I know when I went to the Pinball Hall of Fame Museum in Vegas, they had some 80s arcade games, too.

31:46.000 --> 31:50.000
So is it only pinball at this or did you get to play some like old school arcade games?

31:50.000 --> 31:54.000
There was one arcade game and it was a Donkey Kong.

31:54.000 --> 31:55.000
Random.

31:55.000 --> 31:56.000
Yeah.

31:56.000 --> 31:57.000
Maybe somebody was trying to set a new high score.

31:57.000 --> 31:58.000
Who knows?

31:58.000 --> 32:03.000
But I I had to, of course, show my own doctor who some love.

32:03.000 --> 32:06.000
And I went over and it was my baby.

32:06.000 --> 32:09.000
You know, I just got to play a lot of stuff I don't normally get to see.

32:09.000 --> 32:14.000
And I checked out some stuff that I had seen before and never actually played.

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
And I really tried to give some love to the old pinballs.

32:16.000 --> 32:19.000
And, you know, they're simple.

32:19.000 --> 32:22.000
But they can be a fun little challenge, too.

32:22.000 --> 32:27.000
You know, I got to play a wood rail pinball like from the 50s.

32:27.000 --> 32:28.000
Oh, wow.

32:28.000 --> 32:37.000
And you know, it makes them wood rails that the you know, you normally have that metal bit on the side, you know, but these were wood and they were really fun.

32:37.000 --> 32:39.000
They have quite a different feel to it.

32:39.000 --> 32:43.000
You know, I tilted Black Knight.

32:43.000 --> 32:47.000
It has the best tilt, like tilt warning.

32:47.000 --> 32:50.000
And it's the knight with his fist in the air and it says danger.

32:50.000 --> 32:55.000
And I'm like, OK, that's going to be my warning symbol for everybody is the Black Knight going danger.

32:55.000 --> 33:02.000
Was that that's the sound of our show going to turn off its thunder nearby, because there's like a airport.

33:02.000 --> 33:03.000
It's dragons.

33:03.000 --> 33:05.000
But it's not right.

33:05.000 --> 33:07.000
It's not it's not like a commercial airport.

33:07.000 --> 33:09.000
It's like a UPS and that type of airport.

33:09.000 --> 33:10.000
Oh, yeah.

33:10.000 --> 33:11.000
No, it's not that.

33:11.000 --> 33:18.000
Dude, Y Y R says a friend of his actually works I.T. for Jersey Jack Pinball hook a girl up.

33:18.000 --> 33:21.000
Tell him to send me some swag. Tell him to be my friend.

33:21.000 --> 33:23.000
All right. No, not just because, but I actually want to talk.

33:23.000 --> 33:29.000
I've tried to make friends with as many people that I know who work in pinball just because I love it so much.

33:29.000 --> 33:33.000
I want to learn more of, you know, how these machines come about.

33:33.000 --> 33:38.000
I was so mad that I missed the making of the Deadpool because they also had like another building with instructionals.

33:38.000 --> 33:42.000
And, you know, different, you know, like meet this designer, learn this.

33:42.000 --> 33:45.000
And I was so mad I missed the making of the Deadpool pinball.

33:45.000 --> 33:50.000
I'm really interested in the America's most haunted because that was the table that Ben had created.

33:50.000 --> 33:57.000
And he actually has it's like an open source table where you can actually get all the software that runs it and everything to build your own tables,

33:57.000 --> 34:01.000
which America's most haunted is actually super fun.

34:01.000 --> 34:04.000
It's got like just all the modes in it are really fun.

34:04.000 --> 34:07.000
The targets are fun. The theming is fun.

34:07.000 --> 34:14.000
I like anything that uses magnets, which is why I really like the X-Men game because it's Magneto is your enemy.

34:14.000 --> 34:17.000
Magnets. How do they work?

34:17.000 --> 34:22.000
Anyway, but in that one, it has like a mode where it's like the big Magneto fight mode.

34:22.000 --> 34:28.000
And there's magnets under the play field that will activate at different times and switch your ball in a different direction.

34:28.000 --> 34:35.000
But this one thing I liked about America's most haunted is that there is like a mode where you attack the ghosts and you have to knock down a wall first.

34:35.000 --> 34:41.000
And then you have to go in and hit the ghost inside this little cylinder so many times before it'll catch your ball.

34:41.000 --> 34:44.000
And, you know, that's one of the various modes in it.

34:44.000 --> 34:47.000
It's it's it's a good table. It's really a lot of fun.

34:47.000 --> 34:51.000
Anything for your gaming week outside of this pinball expo that you want to mention?

34:51.000 --> 34:56.000
I ain't played shit. No, I'm kidding. I pokey manned.

34:56.000 --> 34:59.000
I idle pouring.

34:59.000 --> 35:03.000
Oh, and Animal Crossing because I can't get enough.

35:03.000 --> 35:07.000
She can't be stopped during this king gyroids. All right.

35:07.000 --> 35:11.000
Well, we'll move on to Loki. I know you probably didn't play pinball this week, but I didn't play pinball this week.

35:11.000 --> 35:20.000
I did. I did play a few things. So I did purchase and play a little bit of Miami Shakedown, which is when you were streaming a little bit.

35:20.000 --> 35:31.000
It was the one I was streaming and lost all my progress after I was done with it because I got in this weird glitch that put my game in like this weird state where I was dead and alive at the same time.

35:31.000 --> 35:38.000
And so I was like, oh, crap, you know, better save my game to see if I can, you know, at least restart it and save my progress.

35:38.000 --> 35:42.000
And it corrupted the save. So I lost five hours. Yeah, that's fine.

35:42.000 --> 35:47.000
It's a fun game. But yeah, it's like the sequel to Retro City Rampage almost.

35:47.000 --> 35:53.000
And the whole premise of it is that you're this guy who kind of run this runs this company.

35:53.000 --> 35:58.000
And so now you're basically doing all the things that like all the predatory things that all the other companies are normally doing.

35:58.000 --> 36:09.000
Like, you know, click bait ads, you know, selling gift cards that no one's going to redeem or just like all sorts of crazy stuff.

36:09.000 --> 36:16.000
And you're, you know, at the same time also murdering people and all that because it's fun and it's ridiculous.

36:16.000 --> 36:21.000
So, yeah, it's a really fun game. So I played that quite a bit.

36:21.000 --> 36:25.000
And then I went over to strikes finally because I've never been there.

36:25.000 --> 36:37.000
So I played Dance Maniacs, not the Dance Maniacs Konami made, but Dance Maniacs, the actual dancing game, the five.

36:37.000 --> 36:43.000
It's it's the one that's by, I want to say, Kyle Ward or whatever. Oh, oh, they have one of those.

36:43.000 --> 36:48.000
Yeah. Dance Maniacs, I guess, is what it is. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Isn't it Step Maniacs?

36:48.000 --> 36:52.000
Step Maniacs. Sorry, not Dance Maniacs. Step Maniacs. Yeah, that's Kyle's new project.

36:52.000 --> 36:57.000
Yes. So they have one there. Yeah. So I played that a bit and I had.

36:57.000 --> 37:01.000
Well, first off, I didn't really know what songs to play. So I, I did.

37:01.000 --> 37:06.000
I did recognize there was a Dream of Dream was on there or one of the Captain Jack songs that was on there.

37:06.000 --> 37:09.000
They got some licenses. You know, he was he was there.

37:09.000 --> 37:13.000
Even the guys he works with are always pretty sad about that was like getting DDR adjacent stuff.

37:13.000 --> 37:21.000
Yeah. So while I like the game because it's fun in the middle, I'm still getting used to the middle step thing being there.

37:22.000 --> 37:25.000
What I don't enjoy is the in-the-grooveness of it.

37:25.000 --> 37:31.000
And by in-the-grooveness, I mean that more than two arrows at the same time type of bullshit.

37:31.000 --> 37:36.000
You know, where you have to do knee drops and shit. I'm like, fuck that shit.

37:36.000 --> 37:39.000
You can't just disable that type of stuff? You might be able to.

37:39.000 --> 37:42.000
But I didn't know really what I did. I just. But that was the last song.

37:42.000 --> 37:46.000
The step art. Yeah. Okay. So like I kept ramping it up a little bit.

37:46.000 --> 37:49.000
Did you like the touch screen for it? The touch screen is pretty cool. Yeah.

37:49.000 --> 37:52.000
I was like, oh, that's pretty smart. Making like a tablet style.

37:52.000 --> 37:56.000
Yeah. Yeah. I like the game overall and I'm sure it appeals to other people.

37:56.000 --> 38:01.000
I just I didn't like that particular thing. Just, you know, the three arrows at a time.

38:01.000 --> 38:05.000
I know that's something that's pretty popular with like Pump It Up and stuff like that.

38:05.000 --> 38:08.000
That new generation of Bomani. Them kids.

38:08.000 --> 38:14.000
I'm just too old to do knee drops and shit. And so it's just I'm not doing that.

38:14.000 --> 38:18.000
But it was fun otherwise. Really fun game. So I did enjoy that.

38:18.000 --> 38:21.000
I was going to play DDR, but DDR was off at the moment.

38:21.000 --> 38:27.000
They had an integral of three, but some dumb ass was storing their toolbox on the the stage.

38:27.000 --> 38:30.000
So I don't know who the fuck had that shit. Oh, I would have moved it.

38:30.000 --> 38:33.000
I ain't shy. I would have moved. Yeah, I should have. But they had.

38:33.000 --> 38:37.000
It's an integral three step mania cabinet, basically.

38:37.000 --> 38:42.000
So they had that set up there. I don't know why they didn't just put it on the supernova because the supernova is off.

38:42.000 --> 38:46.000
So I didn't end up playing that stuff, but I wanted to. My kids are whining, too.

38:46.000 --> 38:53.000
So I didn't want to do it. I did get the play, though, Neon FM. And so that was fun.

38:53.000 --> 38:55.000
I love Neon FM. I want to go back and play that again.

38:55.000 --> 39:01.000
So I did play because the first time I played it, I was going, but like now I'm like, I'm like, this is like the American pop music.

39:01.000 --> 39:05.000
I'm told. Yeah, sort of. Yeah. And they have like a poppin right next to is kind of fun.

39:05.000 --> 39:08.000
So it's been a little while since I've been over there. They didn't have a poppin.

39:08.000 --> 39:12.000
Yeah, they have a poppin now. They still have sound voltex. They still have sound voltex.

39:12.000 --> 39:18.000
You beat? Maybe? I don't know. But they have a sound voltex.

39:18.000 --> 39:24.000
They they have a poppin. So I thought about they get 2DX yet.

39:24.000 --> 39:29.000
That's no no 2DX. All right. I mean, maybe they can replace the shooting gallery that's in there.

39:29.000 --> 39:35.000
But, you know, put 2DX in there. No, but I did play play that.

39:35.000 --> 39:38.000
And of course, I had to play girls butts. So I did play that.

39:38.000 --> 39:46.000
And then for those that don't understand the reference is this old song like we've been talking about the song like it when it was like 15 years ago.

39:46.000 --> 39:51.000
This was in this neon that it was like being conceived like 15 years ago.

39:51.000 --> 39:56.000
And they released some songs from it. This is one of the songs we always Thomas Howard Litchin horrible.

39:56.000 --> 40:01.000
This song. It's it's a horrible song. Careful that Mike's hot.

40:01.000 --> 40:07.000
I think you're being in Stein. Yeah. But here's the thing is that the game is great.

40:07.000 --> 40:12.000
I just said what a fan I am. That one song is terrible. It's terrible.

40:12.000 --> 40:16.000
It's awesome. Whatever. Yeah, that game is fun, too.

40:16.000 --> 40:19.000
I'm not very good. See, once again, I don't really understand their rankings on there.

40:19.000 --> 40:23.000
So I was like, OK, well, this wasn't that hard.

40:23.000 --> 40:28.000
Let me step it up to this. And they just like it was really hard, like really fast.

40:28.000 --> 40:33.000
And I'm just not very good at like, you know, I'm not very good at pop music connectivity with the phone.

40:33.000 --> 40:36.000
And, you know, no, I mean, that's still a thing. It is still a thing.

40:36.000 --> 40:40.000
You can stick your codes. So I was just like, yeah, I don't need to do it.

40:40.000 --> 40:47.000
But it was fun. So I played that when I do it. A little picture of Alyssa Edwards comes up because that's my avatar.

40:47.000 --> 40:54.000
And then various other arcade games always play the Jurassic Park because it's my youngest son's favorite game.

40:54.000 --> 41:01.000
So we always play that. And this is Rob Roberts secret.

41:01.000 --> 41:08.000
But yeah, the only complaint I have about that arcade is the prices are so expensive, like not so much the music games.

41:08.000 --> 41:11.000
The music games are fine, but like my kids don't play the music games.

41:11.000 --> 41:21.000
They play the redemption games and like that stupid crossy roads thing, which like you die like in three seconds is a buck each time you play.

41:21.000 --> 41:25.000
That's a little ridiculous, but whatever. That's what it is.

41:25.000 --> 41:30.000
And I tried to tell them, do you really want to play this or you want to play this game that you could race a whole race on?

41:30.000 --> 41:35.000
I want to play this game. OK, fine. Interesting, though, about the price stuff, because Locopoco is reminding us in chat.

41:35.000 --> 41:39.000
I can't wait for Roseville to get around one. That's another suburb in the area we live in.

41:39.000 --> 41:43.000
And that's not far at all from strikes. It's going to be interesting when that round one opens up.

41:43.000 --> 41:47.000
It's pretty far away. I guess it's a pretty deep way, but pretty good.

41:47.000 --> 41:51.000
It's a definite schlep for me. Yeah, I mean, for me, they're both far away.

41:51.000 --> 41:56.000
But yeah, I mean, but I will still patronize it.

41:56.000 --> 42:01.000
I will still go and spend my money there to support having around one that maybe that will get one out in my neighborhood.

42:01.000 --> 42:06.000
Yeah. The power says for people who have played me on FM Arcade, how much did your arcade charge per song?

42:06.000 --> 42:09.000
It was a dollar. It was a dollar for three. Yeah.

42:09.000 --> 42:14.000
But it's one of those things where like didn't have like a sliding scale for it because it uses a card.

42:14.000 --> 42:18.000
And like if you put more money in the cards, you get more points, right?

42:18.000 --> 42:22.000
No, this isn't points. It's actual money. So it's actual dollars.

42:22.000 --> 42:27.000
It's not like one of those ones where it's 60 points and you have to try to calculate the math and everything.

42:27.000 --> 42:30.000
And it's a dollar for three songs. Yeah, it's a dollar for three songs.

42:30.000 --> 42:34.000
And so that was OK. And the same for the Step Maniacs.

42:34.000 --> 42:38.000
I think that was a dollar, a dollar fifty for three songs.

42:38.000 --> 42:40.000
But that was most of the games.

42:40.000 --> 42:46.000
New music games, usually those are usually the ones that are the more expensive games, but they weren't here.

42:46.000 --> 42:51.000
It's just all the redemption games are really expensive. Loki, this show is also 17 years old.

42:51.000 --> 42:57.000
Prices have gone up. I understand that. I understand that prices would go up in general,

42:57.000 --> 43:01.000
but you would think that those I guess those games don't have as much of a draw anymore.

43:01.000 --> 43:05.000
But then why shove your arcade full of them if that's the case? I mean, whatever.

43:05.000 --> 43:10.000
I think that place gets really full on like Friday and Saturday. I know there's there's a hardcore crowd,

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
which is funny because it's like, you know, back in the day, that was our scene.

43:12.000 --> 43:15.000
Those are our people. Not to say they're not our people, but you know what I mean?

43:15.000 --> 43:19.000
Like back in the day, that was us hanging out. Yeah. You know, and now now I'm like,

43:19.000 --> 43:25.000
what mixed number are they on a beat me now? I lost count. You know, it's it's a pretty decent arcade.

43:25.000 --> 43:31.000
I would definitely go back and play some stuff. Just not with my kids because, you know, they whine too much.

43:31.000 --> 43:35.000
All right. So that's it. Oh, and Pokemon Go. OK. My gaming week.

43:35.000 --> 43:41.000
So I've been pretty busy playing a variety of different games. Diablo three started season 17.

43:41.000 --> 43:46.000
So I got yes, season 17. And I got in on that playing a little bit of that.

43:46.000 --> 43:53.000
Trying to nobody's power leveling me. Boo hoo. But I think I've gotten my wizard up to like 40 by myself.

43:53.000 --> 43:59.000
So I'll probably keep working on that at least till I get level 70. Get my pity set for the season and some of the achievements.

43:59.000 --> 44:02.000
That would that would be nice. That'd be fun. And then I've been playing Heroes of the Storm.

44:02.000 --> 44:06.000
I mentioned last week I was back on my bullshit with that game. So I'm continuing my bullshit this week.

44:06.000 --> 44:10.000
I'm going to play with you on that one because I'm considering playing it again. Oh, yeah.

44:10.000 --> 44:17.000
I only play matches, but sure. Actually, I did one match with the real people this week.

44:17.000 --> 44:25.000
I played white main as one of the newer healer characters that I played in a real people match and it went horrifically.

44:25.000 --> 44:31.000
So that would be my last player versus player match. It was Spike and a couple others.

44:31.000 --> 44:36.000
No fun. This is a few a couple of years ago, but I don't remember.

44:36.000 --> 44:40.000
And it was a lot of fun. We have friends the game. Yeah. The game hasn't changed that much.

44:40.000 --> 44:45.000
Well, I say that actually it's changed a lot. But like the look and feel hasn't really changed.

44:45.000 --> 44:49.000
I mean, some of the mechanics have been balanced out over time and there's a lot more characters.

44:49.000 --> 44:53.000
But, you know, the base concepts and things haven't changed significantly.

44:53.000 --> 44:57.000
So let's see. Other stuff that I played this week continuing on with Final Fantasy 14.

44:57.000 --> 45:03.000
Haven't played that a lot since we're really in that pre-expansion lull because there's a new expansion looming at the end of June.

45:03.000 --> 45:07.000
So there's not a lot to do right now, but soon there will be more.

45:07.000 --> 45:09.000
And then some other stuff I don't usually talk about.

45:09.000 --> 45:17.000
I played some Tetris 99 this week because they had that event going on where you could get the special Game Boy skin if you got enough points.

45:17.000 --> 45:25.000
And some of it was rough because I was getting like four points or seven points at a time because I would come in like one match.

45:25.000 --> 45:30.000
I was like 62nd place. Another match. I was like, you know, maybe like 31.

45:30.000 --> 45:35.000
You get like you get more respectable showing when you get the higher you get. Have you ever won any?

45:35.000 --> 45:42.000
I have never won one. Sadly, the highest I got, I got my highest placement with the very last match because he gave me all the points I needed.

45:42.000 --> 45:45.000
I got sixth place in a match. So it was very...

45:45.000 --> 45:46.000
That's respectable.

45:46.000 --> 45:54.000
Here's the thing that fucks me up on Tetris 99. I do fine normally, but it's when the pieces start dropping like crazy.

45:54.000 --> 46:06.000
And the switch controller, especially if you're playing like with the controllers docked on the system, which is how I, you know, so I can play like lying on the couch or whatever.

46:06.000 --> 46:09.000
I can play 99 that way. It really doesn't control well.

46:09.000 --> 46:13.000
I really don't like controlling it that way because you have to use those little buttons.

46:13.000 --> 46:17.000
You can't use the L stick because the L stick is for like targeting and stuff.

46:17.000 --> 46:22.000
So I just I really don't like playing that way. It's a lot better on a pro controller.

46:22.000 --> 46:27.000
But even then, yeah, that's my one complaint is that just it doesn't control perfection.

46:27.000 --> 46:31.000
So when the pieces start dropping really fast, I lose it.

46:31.000 --> 46:34.000
Like I just I can't I'm fucking up left and right putting bricks where they shouldn't be.

46:34.000 --> 46:37.000
And I just so I can't handle the speed when it gets that fast.

46:37.000 --> 46:41.000
So why we are in chat says, damn, I forgot about the event. It's already over.

46:41.000 --> 46:46.000
No, you have until eleven fifty nine Pacific tonight. So get on it.

46:46.000 --> 46:49.000
Yeah. Get on it. You have two hours.

46:49.000 --> 46:52.000
The nice thing is no. Eleven fifty nine Pacific.

46:52.000 --> 46:56.000
I said this. Oh yeah. Pacific. So you have about five hours.

46:56.000 --> 47:01.000
Wait. No specific time. It's only 650. I'm sorry. I was the words.

47:01.000 --> 47:04.000
It's fine. So anyway, I will say this.

47:04.000 --> 47:11.000
The nice thing is you get to kind of preview the skin because the tournament is played on that Gameboy skin that you're basically working to earn.

47:11.000 --> 47:20.000
So, you know, at least play one or two matches so you can see it because maybe you'll play it and be like, eh, the skin isn't that good.

47:20.000 --> 47:24.000
And that would be fine as well. So up to you.

47:24.000 --> 47:27.000
Let's see. What else did I play? Oh, real quick. I got one other.

47:27.000 --> 47:31.000
So I bought the Castlevania collection on PlayStation four. Yeah, because I came out on Tuesday.

47:31.000 --> 47:34.000
So I only played old school Castlevania.

47:34.000 --> 47:42.000
But yeah, it's old school Castlevania with, you know, one safe state that you can save and load if you want.

47:42.000 --> 47:46.000
Although back in my day, we didn't have safe states. You had to play through the whole game or you were trash.

47:46.000 --> 47:53.000
So I want to see if I can at least get back up to level five in the Grim Reaper boss because stage five has the best music.

47:53.000 --> 47:57.000
And like probably like any. I don't know, because some of the music in Simon's Quest is so amazing.

47:57.000 --> 48:01.000
But at least in Castlevania one, stage five is like my favorite song of the whole game.

48:01.000 --> 48:05.000
So I want to get back to that to hear that again. Yeah. So I was having fun.

48:05.000 --> 48:10.000
I guess Konami did an all right job with it like they they didn't fuck it up completely.

48:10.000 --> 48:13.000
So let's let's. Hello. Let's celebrate that. Hurray.

48:13.000 --> 48:17.000
You emulated the game. Well, you did a thing.

48:17.000 --> 48:20.000
You did a thing that everybody's been doing for several decades now.

48:20.000 --> 48:28.000
So, yeah, I'm hearing that they're going to release the Japanese versions as like an add on a free patch thing later on.

48:28.000 --> 48:34.000
So that if you want to play Castlevania three with like the bonus Famicom disc music set,

48:34.000 --> 48:37.000
I think it might have been something that was actually in the cartridge. I don't remember how that worked.

48:37.000 --> 48:40.000
But there was like just an extra some extra tones in Japan.

48:40.000 --> 48:44.000
So we'll be able to actually play that version soon, too, although they didn't date that.

48:44.000 --> 48:47.000
So we don't know when. But that's something that's coming, which is pretty exciting.

48:47.000 --> 48:52.000
So. Hurray. So. All right. Let's see.

48:52.000 --> 48:56.000
Dark, dark to see in chat says M2 killed it with this collection, in my opinion.

48:56.000 --> 48:59.000
You can hear the better music on the main menu. That is true.

48:59.000 --> 49:04.000
You can hear that music right away while you're picking because it does have your basic menu that, you know, you can pick a game.

49:04.000 --> 49:09.000
It has like a manual, like a virtual manual that you can look through online.

49:09.000 --> 49:13.000
You know, some of some of the things that like collections do these days is it's cute.

49:13.000 --> 49:20.000
You know, again, they they did a thing. I'm sure it's I in some ways I kind of wish I hadn't bought it on PlayStation 4.

49:20.000 --> 49:23.000
I don't know why I did. I was like, oh, trophies, television. I don't know.

49:23.000 --> 49:25.000
I haven't bought anything on PlayStation 4 in a while. Let's do that.

49:25.000 --> 49:29.000
I wish I'd bought it on the Switch because then I could pick it up and take it with me.

49:29.000 --> 49:34.000
And I bet the collection is great on Switch. But oh, well, so much for that anyway.

49:34.000 --> 49:38.000
So that was my gaming week. OK, sorry. I know it was a lot, but I had a busy week with gaming.

49:38.000 --> 49:42.000
That's good. We you know, sometimes we like to play video games around here, believe it or not.

49:42.000 --> 49:46.000
But let's get into some gaming news, some quick housekeeping.

49:46.000 --> 49:49.000
One more time, I will say it. We're not going to be here next week.

49:49.000 --> 49:52.000
Dark Sakura is going to Southern California. She's going to Drag Con.

49:52.000 --> 49:56.000
Yeah. So she can meet Miss Vanjie. Honestly. Yeah. Yeah.

49:56.000 --> 50:00.000
And what are I met Alexis Mateo last year. Quickly.

50:00.000 --> 50:04.000
This isn't a Drag Race podcast and Loki's going to internally scream if we go too far off the rails.

50:04.000 --> 50:08.000
But your top three queens you want to meet at Drag Con. Top three.

50:08.000 --> 50:14.000
This is Cracker again. OK. Trixie. Uh huh. Not Trixie. Katja. OK. Katja better. Sorry.

50:14.000 --> 50:20.000
Wow. Wig. And I don't know. I want to see Mayhem again.

50:20.000 --> 50:27.000
I really liked Mayhem. She's a sweetheart. Yeah. I want to find out what the hell's up with Soju.

50:27.000 --> 50:30.000
Soju's really the stepped up the game since Drag Race already.

50:30.000 --> 50:34.000
The good news is, too, Mayhem comes up here locally a lot. All right. But anyway, we're not going to derail.

50:34.000 --> 50:37.000
I'm also going to be going to Mickey's, but I don't think Mayhem's hosting that night.

50:37.000 --> 50:41.000
So you're going to Drag Con. You're going to some drag events affiliated with Drag Con.

50:41.000 --> 50:44.000
I want to see Bible Girl again if she's there. I'd really like Madeline Hatter to come.

50:44.000 --> 50:46.000
You're going to do some other non drag things, though, too, right?

50:46.000 --> 50:53.000
Yes. I'm going to San Diego to visit with some sister friends and hopefully go to Extraordinary Desserts,

50:53.000 --> 50:57.000
which I haven't been to in like 12 years. Amazing.

50:57.000 --> 51:04.000
And then back up and going to Disneyland on Tuesday, maybe by myself.

51:04.000 --> 51:08.000
Disney will be fine. Call Aria Snark. Well, she's probably working.

51:08.000 --> 51:12.000
Aria Snark will be like, oh, it's a day ending in Y. Let's go to Disneyland.

51:12.000 --> 51:20.000
Well, I'm going to say this. My thing about going to Disneyland by myself is every other time I have ever gone to Disneyland,

51:20.000 --> 51:26.000
there have been other people with me and I either have to slow down to other people's pace or catch up to other people's pace.

51:26.000 --> 51:31.000
And if my feet hurt, you know, I feel guilty about sitting down by myself.

51:32.000 --> 51:39.000
You know, I may have another mutual friend of ours meet there. Maybe Renee.

51:39.000 --> 51:40.000
Yay.

51:40.000 --> 51:45.000
But if not, I'm not at anything. It's a day at my pace.

51:45.000 --> 51:49.000
I totally respect that. You know, I had an ex who was really into Disneyland.

51:49.000 --> 51:52.000
You probably know him talk about before I was with Alan. So it was a while ago, right?

51:52.000 --> 51:53.000
Because I've been with Alan for almost a decade now.

51:53.000 --> 52:00.000
But my ex right before Alan was super into Disney and used to go by himself to Disneyland.

52:00.000 --> 52:02.000
And at first I was kind of like, you go to Disneyland by yourself.

52:02.000 --> 52:06.000
But then when I kind of like heard more about it, I was like, because he really he loved to people watch.

52:06.000 --> 52:11.000
He said the people watching Disneyland is better than any other place on the planet for people watching.

52:11.000 --> 52:12.000
And I believe it.

52:12.000 --> 52:14.000
I think I want to take my legit Polaroid with me.

52:14.000 --> 52:15.000
Yeah.

52:15.000 --> 52:18.000
And just take Polaroids of scenes at Disneyland.

52:18.000 --> 52:22.000
But, you know, the other thing, too, is it's also going to be my first attempt at Disney bounding.

52:22.000 --> 52:29.000
So I have a Captain Marvel like skater dress and all I need is a brown hoodie or sweater.

52:29.000 --> 52:35.000
And then I'm going to get like flight pin to pin to the the jacket, you know, kind of like her end of the movie outfit.

52:35.000 --> 52:36.000
Yeah.

52:36.000 --> 52:38.000
Well, I didn't see the movie, but I know the outfit.

52:38.000 --> 52:43.000
But, you know, I was just thinking I haven't Disney bounded before I have got the dress.

52:43.000 --> 52:45.000
You know, why not just go have fun?

52:45.000 --> 52:47.000
So some folks in chat full support of what you're doing.

52:47.000 --> 52:50.000
Why are not that you need anybody's permission.

52:50.000 --> 52:54.000
But why are says going to an amusement park by yourself equals you get to do whatever the heck you want.

52:54.000 --> 52:57.000
And Bobby Blackwell says best part of Disney by yourself is being a single rider.

52:57.000 --> 52:59.000
Jump all the lines.

52:59.000 --> 53:02.000
Well, on top of that, anyway, I always wait for the front of the lines like for.

53:02.000 --> 53:09.000
Well, now it would be in credit coaster, which I haven't been on, but it's the same roller coaster.

53:09.000 --> 53:14.000
But, you know, I I usually wait for four fronts of the lines anyway.

53:14.000 --> 53:16.000
So I have no problem with that.

53:16.000 --> 53:21.000
Will you FaceTime me when you go on a credit coaster just so you can stick your phone out so I can ride the ride with you?

53:21.000 --> 53:25.000
I actually drop the ride or drop it. Bad idea.

53:25.000 --> 53:31.000
Well, I mean, I would hold it, but usually because of my vertigo problem, I'm actually really holding tight.

53:31.000 --> 53:33.000
I also have to hold my glasses on sometimes.

53:33.000 --> 53:35.000
She just needs to strap a GoPro to her head.

53:35.000 --> 53:40.000
All right. All right. FaceTime me on Haunted Mansion, then someone give me a GoPro.

53:40.000 --> 53:44.000
Give me a GoPro and I will record all of my.

53:44.000 --> 53:51.000
But the problem being number one, Loco Poco, I hate mint juleps. Hate them.

53:51.000 --> 53:56.000
She's responding to a chat comment about Loco Poco says lobster roll gumbo and mint juleps.

53:56.000 --> 54:00.000
I'm not going to Blue Bayou because it'll be me.

54:00.000 --> 54:05.000
And since my gastric bypass, I can't eat enough food to make it worthwhile.

54:05.000 --> 54:11.000
So I'm actually going to be bringing a messenger bag with me into the park for my stuff.

54:11.000 --> 54:19.000
And I'm probably going to have little containers of leftovers with me because I will probably get like one like maybe a Monte Cristo.

54:19.000 --> 54:25.000
And that will be three meals for me. I'm not joking. That will be three meals.

54:25.000 --> 54:30.000
Although Blue Bayou is one of my favorite places to eat. My other favorite place is gone.

54:30.000 --> 54:36.000
I do have a bucket. Oh, the bucket of meat. And I like car.

54:36.000 --> 54:39.000
OK, I ate their one wrap up a little bit. Sorry.

54:39.000 --> 54:45.000
Getting a little deep on Disney and it is a gaming podcast, but I do let us know like what types of like games you see there.

54:45.000 --> 54:50.000
You know, maybe I just got excited. I just got excited. You should. Well, you know, they had Kingdom Hearts pins.

54:50.000 --> 54:56.000
Yeah. They have King Mickey in the hood. We want the update on all the loot because there's a third game out there now to support.

54:56.000 --> 55:00.000
So, you know, the third game actually came with its own pin.

55:00.000 --> 55:08.000
Yeah. Anyway, also so. So Dark Soccer is going to be there. So again, this is this is about there being no show next Sunday.

55:08.000 --> 55:15.000
I'm going to be in Chicago, which is fun because I have a lot of good friends there that I visit once a year or try to.

55:15.000 --> 55:23.000
But the whole way this started before it turned into this whole now Alan's coming and we're just going to hang out with friends and everything is that I'm going to an Ingress anomaly.

55:23.000 --> 55:29.000
It's like a live event for Ingress. So that's going to be a lot of fun. So that is that is actually on Saturday.

55:29.000 --> 55:33.000
But I'm not going to be back in time. So they do unknowns for that as well.

55:33.000 --> 55:38.000
No, because because it's not the same like Pokemon and Ingress don't overlap. They understand that.

55:38.000 --> 55:45.000
But, you know, they're not they're already there. No, in fact, what actually actually it's kind of the reverse of that.

55:45.000 --> 55:52.000
Niantic did some shitty planning because that Lapras, that shiny Lapras like the it's a three hour event, if I remember right.

55:52.000 --> 55:56.000
And the first or the last hour of the event is the first hour of the anomaly.

55:56.000 --> 56:00.000
So they they overlapped it. So so we can't do both.

56:00.000 --> 56:05.000
And it's actually really annoying because there's a lot of people that are like, but I want to catch Lapras.

56:05.000 --> 56:08.000
I was like, no, we need you. You know, you need to be firing bursters.

56:08.000 --> 56:16.000
So they overlap.

56:16.000 --> 56:20.000
No, by the way, I got my shiny Torchic today.

56:20.000 --> 56:25.000
Oh, yes, I did play Pokemon Go and I got I played via Bluetooth and I caught one Torchic.

56:25.000 --> 56:30.000
So I'm I'm happy enough with that. I want a second window of all that.

56:30.000 --> 56:34.000
I evolved it all the way and got that whatever you're supposed to get the skin or whatever.

56:34.000 --> 56:39.000
Yeah, the special powered one. And I did get one shiny, but it's no shit stats.

56:39.000 --> 56:43.000
So, I don't know. All right.

56:43.000 --> 56:46.000
So anyway, yeah, so that's why we won't be here next Sunday.

56:46.000 --> 56:49.000
But, you know, we'll miss you and we'll be back in two weeks.

56:49.000 --> 56:52.000
And E3 is going to be here before we know it.

56:52.000 --> 56:55.000
I may stream something because Bobby said that he would just kick it over to me.

56:55.000 --> 56:58.000
So we'll see. Because you're still not a affiliate, right?

56:58.000 --> 57:02.000
No, I'm not. It's a really good way to get your average numbers up.

57:02.000 --> 57:05.000
So I'd really consider it. Yeah, I probably will.

57:05.000 --> 57:08.000
All right. Do some DDR or something. Play something fun. We'll see.

57:08.000 --> 57:12.000
All right. And also, I should just note, you know, episode seven, seven, seven.

57:12.000 --> 57:16.000
Although, I don't know, we kind of stopped celebrating landmark numbers a long time ago.

57:16.000 --> 57:25.000
This one has some particular significance to it because 7-7-7 is a song that was originally in Guitar Freaks, right?

57:25.000 --> 57:29.000
And then was in Poppin' Music and then was in DDR. So it's in like all the big Bawani franchises.

57:29.000 --> 57:31.000
So 7-7-7 is actually the name of the song.

57:31.000 --> 57:36.000
So I remember back in the day when we were focused on music games and I think we were doing episodes.

57:36.000 --> 57:40.000
I want to say it was during episode 77. Somebody probably cracked the joke.

57:40.000 --> 57:43.000
Like, oh, we're so close. We probably played 7-7-7 on a break or something.

57:43.000 --> 57:45.000
We probably cracked the joke.

57:45.000 --> 57:49.000
Did we play 7-7-7 or did we play the seven jump? Because we probably played the seven jump.

57:49.000 --> 57:52.000
We probably played both. We played a lot of music back in those days. We probably played both.

57:52.000 --> 57:58.000
But I imagine we cracked the joke about, oh, 7-7-7 will be here, but we won't.

57:58.000 --> 58:05.000
You know, it's everything like, or we said, gosh, if the show stays on pace, will it be on episode 7-7-7 by like 2018, 2019?

58:05.000 --> 58:09.000
Or whatever we predicted at the time because you never know, like weeks off, holidays, things like that.

58:09.000 --> 58:13.000
We might've thought it was going to be earlier and here we are. We're still here, believe it or not.

58:13.000 --> 58:18.000
So in some ways it's kind of, kind of funny because I know we made the joke at some point that, well,

58:18.000 --> 58:22.000
we're not going to be there when episode 7-7-7 hits and yet we are.

58:22.000 --> 58:25.000
So thank you all for being here and making it worth it.

58:25.000 --> 58:26.000
Because the show what we knew.

58:26.000 --> 58:27.000
Yeah, right.

58:27.000 --> 58:31.000
Whatevs. Don't listen to us anymore. We don't know what we're talking about.

58:31.000 --> 58:34.000
All right. Anyway, let's get into some news.

58:34.000 --> 58:37.000
So Loki, start us off with some headlines, some news this week.

58:37.000 --> 58:44.000
So as I mentioned, I did purchase Shakedown, or Shakedown Hawaii, I want to say Shakedown Miami.

58:44.000 --> 58:51.000
No, on the Epic Games Store during their Epic Games Store sale, their mega sale.

58:51.000 --> 58:57.000
Now this sale is a little different than most sales that you would see like on the Steam store.

58:57.000 --> 59:04.000
Because this one, the developers behind the games, they have no real say in this at all.

59:04.000 --> 59:13.000
Epic is just giving you $10 per game that's over $15 or $15 and more towards your purchase.

59:13.000 --> 59:18.000
So like for example, this game was $19.99. I paid $9.99. Sounds good to me.

59:18.000 --> 59:25.000
However, not a lot of people or developers around here are kind of happy with this.

59:25.000 --> 59:28.000
Because one, it's devaluing their game.

59:28.000 --> 59:34.000
So on other platforms, they may also have an agreement where they have to keep price parity.

59:34.000 --> 59:40.000
And since they didn't have a say over the fact that whether they participated in the discounts or not,

59:40.000 --> 59:45.000
it's just kind of happening with Epic doing it, that they're a little unhappy with that.

59:45.000 --> 59:47.000
And I can actually put them in some trouble.

59:47.000 --> 59:53.000
In fact, there's even been some publishers dropping out of this as well.

59:53.000 --> 01:00:02.000
So for example, one of the publishers during the Mega Sale that's behind Vampire the Masquerade Bloodlines 2,

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:09.000
they had taken their game off of the storefront for a while because of this reason as well.

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:12.000
They said, and of course Epic came out and commented,

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:17.000
if a developer or publisher chooses not to participate in our sales, we will honor that decision.

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:20.000
Paradox Interactive has chosen not to participate in the Epic Mega Sale.

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:23.000
And the game has been temporarily removed from sale.

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:28.000
If you purchase Vampire the Masquerade Bloodlines 2 during the period when the discount did not apply at the time of checkout,

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000
Epic will honor that price.

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:38.000
So I get it. So Epic was putting these games on sale and publishers kind of just got told they were participating.

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:41.000
Or it almost sounds like, do it now, ask for forgiveness later.

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:46.000
Which when it comes to money, it seems like a really amateurish mistake by Epic.

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:57.000
Whoa, it gets better. So not only are their publishers, not only are the developers not necessarily behind on having their games on here.

01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:00.000
So on top of that, there's some games that are being pre-ordered right now.

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:01.000
And this actually applies to pre-orders.

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:05.000
Funny enough, Borderlands 3 is not able to be pre-ordered right now.

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:10.000
So I can't put $10 towards that because that would be something I'd want to put $10 towards.

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000
But they know that game's going to sell whatever.

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:13.000
It's also a little too easy.

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000
Yeah, it's a little too easy, but whatever.

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:20.000
So they have, you know, that it's devaluing their game and that may cause people to wait on that.

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:27.000
But the people that did actually take part in this as well, if you had made five purchases in a row, guess what?

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:34.000
Because they don't have a cart that you can build, you know, that you can buy multiple games at a time, you have to do a piecemeal one at a time.

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:41.000
You do it five times, the system flags you as the transactions that, I don't know the exact term,

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:48.000
but it's basically phishing and you lock your account because that you're purchasing all these games.

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:54.000
So, I mean, I think this is, you know, it's finally the Epic Store kind of showing maybe where their weakness is.

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:58.000
And that is experience because I think there's been a lot of people that have been saying,

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:04.000
oh, well Steam, you know, they suck because, you know, their store is full of garbage and, you know,

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000
the Epic Store gives more money to the publishers.

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:13.000
And we even saw when the Epic Store, when they came out and they said, well, we'll stop grabbing all these exclusive borderlands and stuff

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:16.000
when Steam starts giving more share to the publishers and so forth.

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:23.000
So, they say that and then they do this on one hand, which in some ways is almost a little bit anti-publisher

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:28.000
to not ask for permission first before putting all these games on sale.

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:31.000
That's a really, I mean, I don't know a better word than it's a dumb move.

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.000
It's a dumb move what they did.

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:38.000
I mean, sure, the consumers, the gamers are sitting here going, great, deals, sales, great.

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:43.000
Sure, but I mean, don't you guys see how stupid that is that Epic on one hand is saying,

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:47.000
well, Steam, if you'd only do this, and then they go and do something bonehead like this?

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.000
Like, it just shows a very big lack of experience.

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000
And how long are they going to be able to just throw money at the problem?

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:58.000
You know, it's not that, you know, people don't necessarily want to jump into the Epic Store because it's the Epic Store.

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:03.000
They don't want to jump in because the Epic Store doesn't have most of the features that Steam has right now.

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:07.000
It's very bare bones and there's not a lot of games on there.

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:14.000
And yeah, the sale is a neat idea, but, you know, and it's good that you're paying that portion to it,

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:22.000
but how long are you going to be able to throw money at the store to get people to come in before people just realize that, you know, whatever.

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:27.000
I'm, like, personally, I bought this game on the Epic Store because it's exclusive there right now.

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:31.000
I wanted to play it. I could have bought it on console, but I'm never going to get the TV back, so it's fine.

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:35.000
I'm just going to play it on my PC, and I'm happy they did it.

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:38.000
Doesn't mean I'm going to buy all my games on the Epic Store.

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000
So, you know, I don't know.

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:45.000
YYR, with his perspective in our chat at Twitch TV slash VOG Network, saying,

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000
FYI, all Steam sales are opt-in.

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:54.000
If I don't log into the Steamworks portal, accept the terms, and set a discount rate, my games don't get discounts during big Steam sales.

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:58.000
And Metal Mayhem says, yeah, they made an epic goof.

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:02.000
I'm going to fucking quit this show, I swear to God.

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:05.000
No, just sad trombone it in your head and move on.

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:08.000
Alright. Anything else to say about this sale?

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:09.000
So you did take advantage of it.

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:15.000
I did take advantage of it, and I was going to purchase another game, but, like, I didn't really want any of the quadratic dream games.

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:19.000
I was like, eh. I would have picked up Borderlands. I would have pre-ordered that.

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.000
I said pre-order.

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:29.000
I know, but then that totally, like, considering how much games rely on that release week sales, like, to devalue that release week, that would have been horrible.

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:33.000
So I understand why Borderlands 3 is not participating in that. I totally understand that.

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:34.000
Very convenient.

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:38.000
Alright, SGA100Matt saying, don't quit. How about this? How about this? We'll make an agreement.

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:42.000
I'm going to quit for one week. I quit for one week.

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.000
I'm not coming back next week.

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:45.000
I'm not coming back next week.

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:46.000
But the week after.

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:47.000
The week after, I'll be here.

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000
Alright.

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:53.000
Moving on. Something that maybe I would quit OLR to go play.

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:57.000
No, just kidding. I wouldn't because I don't know how I feel about this.

01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:01.000
I'm very much of two schools of thought about this, but it is the World of Warcraft classic.

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:04.000
So I was playing World of Warcraft in the vanilla day.

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:08.000
I didn't play long. I played much more in the Burning Crusade days.

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:12.000
I even was raiding in those days with some local friends and all that stuff.

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000
But in the vanilla wow, I played, like, a little bit of it.

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:20.000
And then, of course, I played most of the expansions until I kind of left for Final Fantasy XIV.

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000
And then I check in on wow once in a while.

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:25.000
Wow is the one I like to visit once in a while.

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.000
Have a fling with here and there.

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:34.000
But World of Warcraft classic will be there for you to experience the World of Warcraft in the vanilla mode, or the 1.0 mode.

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:39.000
Or actually, specifically, I think it's 1.2.2 mode, I think.

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.000
Sorry, I may have the version number wrong.

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:46.000
But it's one of the later patches in vanilla that I think incorporates on Karaj and things like that.

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:50.000
But anyway, the release date came out this week. It will be out on August 26th.

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000
That's the big day.

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:56.000
The UK is also that's the day, and that's the day in the Americas.

01:05:56.000 --> 01:06:01.000
Some of the other regions, just the way the time zones work, it'll actually be August 27th.

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:06.000
If you subscribe to World of Warcraft, you are also automatically subscribed to this, basically.

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:07.000
There's no extra cost.

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000
So this is included with a wow subscription.

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:14.000
So if you want to pay your subscription to play Classic WoW, if you're one of those people that's like,

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.000
I hate that newfangled wow.

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.000
I liked leveling all my weapons and my fists.

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:22.000
Back in my day, you had to level to 40 to get a mount. We liked it.

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:25.000
Or really, my only thing, I miss Baron's Chat.

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:29.000
So, well, just think, Baron's Chat will be back with this.

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000
That's still not enough to make me play old WoW.

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.000
Not enough to make me play old WoW.

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.000
Baron's Chat is also not a good thing. I'm sorry.

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.000
No, it was kind of accessible.

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000
You're going to log into that chat.

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:40.000
That's Baron's Chat.

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:41.000
Okay.

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:42.000
Oh, it's so cute.

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:43.000
You're going to really play it.

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:44.000
Oh, you're so adorable.

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:45.000
Okay.

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:46.000
So, Baron's Chat.

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:49.000
The Baron's was this zone.

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:50.000
It was huge.

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:51.000
It was huge.

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:56.000
So because it was such a huge zone and there were so many different level characters that went through there,

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:59.000
the general chat was just like a chat room, basically.

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:04.000
And general chat is for you to like, hi, I'm looking for somebody to help me with this quest.

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:05.000
Or who wants it?

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:08.000
Because, again, in vanilla WoW, there was no dungeon finder.

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:13.000
So, looking for two more for Wailing Caverns, you know, things like that, right?

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:16.000
And it really was big. It was easily the size of three zones.

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:17.000
Right.

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:20.000
So, Baron's was such a huge zone that the chat room just turned into,

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:24.000
just imagine an unmoderated general topic IRC chat room.

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:25.000
Old AOL.

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:29.000
That's where your Chuck Norris jokes all came from, was Baron's Chat and all that.

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.000
So, that's...

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.000
But with Cataclysm, they broke it into two zones.

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:34.000
Yes.

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.000
And with different level areas for each part.

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:39.000
Yeah, so Cataclysm kind of broke Baron's Chat, in a way.

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:42.000
But now they all went to trade chat, because trade chat's across all zones.

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:46.000
But I don't know, I feel like the garbage chat isn't there like it used to be.

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:50.000
I think in the cities, the cities are all linked together with their chat,

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:51.000
and that's where you see it the most.

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:52.000
Like the local?

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:57.000
Yeah, people will get in there and argue politics in the general.

01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:59.000
It's usually why I just stay in guild chat, whether or not anyone's talking.

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:03.000
That's also why the first thing I do in my World of Warcraft account starts up.

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.000
Congrats, you have a new character. You have spawned.

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:07.000
Slash leave general.

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:11.000
It's the first thing I do before I even press the key to move.

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:15.000
I'll keep it open for train wreck time, but other than that, yeah.

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000
I just redo all my windows.

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:18.000
Yeah.

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:22.000
Vidpower573 in chat says, Baron's Chat had so many in-jokes.

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:25.000
Chuck Norris, Mankirk's wife, I'll remember that,

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:30.000
because plot twist, she's dead, and she's really hard to find.

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:34.000
So multiple times an hour, somebody's yelling out in chat,

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000
where's Mankirk's wife?

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:39.000
She's dead.

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.000
This was even before we had Wowhead, right?

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:42.000
Oh, yeah.

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:43.000
Yeah, way before Wowhead.

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:46.000
Because I don't know if mods were in vanilla WoW.

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:47.000
I can't remember.

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:50.000
There wasn't as much strong of a mod community, so I don't know.

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:55.000
Anyway, the Drums of War update from August 2006,

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:58.000
that is the version that they're going to be using for this.

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:03.000
They're doing a whole WoW 15th birthday with some in-game events.

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:08.000
There's a $100 15th anniversary collector's edition of the game if you want.

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.000
So you want to spend $100 on WoW?

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:11.000
No.

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.000
You'll get a 10-inch Ragnaros statue for that.

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.000
A pen, a mousepad, and some art.

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:16.000
Yay art.

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:17.000
Whatever.

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:19.000
Also of note, and this is cracking me up,

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:24.000
because there is a beta going on, you have people filing bug reports.

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:31.000
Unfortunately, not everybody's memory is really working the same way,

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:37.000
because people are filing bug reports for things that were actually features in WoW 1.0.

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:38.000
Like what?

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.000
For example, actually I'm glad you asked,

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:43.000
because Blizzard made what's called a blue post.

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:46.000
That means an official Blizzard team member went on the forums and made a post saying,

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:49.000
That means an official Blizzard team member went on the forums and made a post saying,

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:56.000
As we've discussed before, the nature of WoW Classic sometimes invokes different memories for different players.

01:09:56.000 --> 01:10:03.000
And this leads to certain misconceptions for some about what is or isn't working as intended.

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:09.000
The following is a list of commonly reported gameplay in WoW Classic that is not actually a bug

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:11.000
and working as we expect it to.

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:16.000
Tauren's hitboxes and their melee reach is larger than other races.

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:21.000
Tauren are the big cow people, so obviously they're bigger.

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:30.000
Being critically struck while using slash sit to sit does not cause abilities like enrage, blood craze, and reckoning to activate.

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:36.000
Warrior health regeneration is working at the expected rate.

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:41.000
Feared players and NPCs run fast.

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:51.000
Standing on top of other players while facing away allows spells and attacks to be used.

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.000
I'm trying to find other ones that are...

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:58.000
Quests that are too low level do not show up as an exclamation point in the game world.

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.000
They just didn't...

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:03.000
Available quests do not display an exclamation on the mini map.

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.000
That was a thing they added way later in the game.

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:09.000
Either they never played vanilla or they just don't remember.

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:18.000
On level up, the message, your skill in protection increased to 15 was added in 1.12.1 and we're intending to keep that.

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:21.000
We appreciate all of your feedback.

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:23.000
I'm sorry, this is really funny.

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:27.000
Because it just also goes on to show how many people were like,

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:30.000
Fuck yeah, WoW Classic, yeah, WoW Classic, I want to play WoW Classic.

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:36.000
And then they forget, WoW Classic had no quality of life improvements, none, zero.

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.000
You know me here, you don't know shit.

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:42.000
Have fun with that.

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:46.000
I don't know, there's a part of me that like, it'll be fun for a minute.

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.000
And then there's another part of me that's like,

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:54.000
But why did they spend all this time perfecting this?

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:59.000
They went back and made this compatible with the 16x9 resolutions and all that stuff.

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:02.000
And went back to make sure it works on the modern PCs and all that.

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:07.000
It's kind of like, why did they spend the time doing that when they could have like, I don't know, made the current WoW better?

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:11.000
It's just, I don't know, whatever.

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:13.000
I wish them luck.

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.000
I'll be curious to see how many people are playing.

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.000
Because you're going to have to pay to play it.

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.000
So I'll be curious how many people do that.

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:22.000
I'll be very, very curious how many people are on those servers.

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:26.000
In the meantime, DarkSakura, you have some relatively big news for us this week.

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:31.000
Yep. Basically, dogs and cats living together.

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:34.000
Mass hysteria. No, I'm kidding.

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:39.000
Microsoft and Sony are going to team up and have an AI cloud baby.

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:42.000
It might be monstrous, we don't know.

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:47.000
Anyway, so they are actually going to be working together.

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:50.000
And yes, both sides have admitted that they've worked together in the past.

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:53.000
But are also still rivals in some areas.

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:54.000
That's just the way they are.

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:58.000
Oh my God, is Microsoft putting Halo on the PlayStation 5?

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:01.000
Because that's what I heard on Twitter when somebody put this story.

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:05.000
Microsoft and Sony are working together. Oh my God.

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:08.000
Way to assume. You know what happens when you assume?

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:11.000
You become an asshole. I'm sorry.

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:14.000
That's how I'm going to say it from now on, you become an asshole.

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:19.000
Anyway, Microsoft has their Azure cloud service.

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:21.000
It's a computing platform.

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:24.000
And so Microsoft and Sony are going to both be using it.

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:29.000
It's to support game content, digital content, streaming services.

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:41.000
And the kind of speculation about this is that Sony is going to be using this for development of AI.

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:49.000
And using their sensors and chips in the Microsoft cloud systems.

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:52.000
As in their local servers and computers that run it.

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:58.000
To better make cloud work. Rain things better. Or more betterer.

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:02.000
Anyway, it's going to cloud stuff better. Yeah, there we go.

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:03.000
And then he'll have better hair.

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:10.000
So at any rate, the quote from Yoshida Kenichiro, who is Sony's CEO, says, quote,

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:13.000
for many years Microsoft has been a key business partner for us.

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:17.000
Though, of course, the two companies have also been competing in some areas.

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:24.000
I believe that our joint development of future cloud solutions will contribute greatly to the advancement of interactive content, end quote.

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:32.000
And basically their goal for Sony is to evolve the platform of the PlayStation into one that uses internet cloud solutions.

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:37.000
That uses internet cloud services for better entertainment at any time, any place.

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:43.000
So they're looking to make it. I don't know if that might be a hint at another handheld.

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:46.000
Or, I mean, I don't think so.

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:47.000
I don't think so either.

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:53.000
But it could also be that maybe Nintendo has set the bar with what they did with the Switch.

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:56.000
That maybe Sony might take.

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:59.000
Sorry, maybe I shouldn't be so quick to dismiss handhelds.

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:02.000
Because, I mean, after all, a lot of cloud gaming is including handhelds.

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.000
So maybe I shouldn't be so quick to dismiss that.

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:07.000
But I don't think that's the ultimate focus or ultimate goal.

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:10.000
That will be more a side effect, if I may.

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:17.000
Well, and of course, part of me also wonders if maybe this venture might be something to counteract Stadia.

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:21.000
Well, you know, it's funny because Nifty 805 in our chat brings up the same question there.

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:24.000
I wonder if it's a response to Google's upcoming cloud service.

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:31.000
I don't think it's a response so much as it is the entire industry trying to read the tea leaves on where is this industry going.

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:34.000
And I think Google has kind of shown their hand first.

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:40.000
And now we're getting a little insight, we're getting a little peek as to what cards Microsoft and Sony are holding.

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:45.000
And the joke is they're actually working together in some regards.

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:48.000
This doesn't mean Halo is going to be on the next PlayStation.

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:49.000
It's not like where this is going.

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:53.000
This isn't even about the PlayStation 5.

01:15:53.000 --> 01:16:01.000
I think one way I kind of put this on Twitter is that it isn't about the PlayStation 5 so much as it is where is gaming going to be in 2025.

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:07.000
And on top of this too, they haven't said anything about rivaling what Stadia is going to offer.

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:11.000
Too soon. We don't really know what Stadia is offering, to be fair.

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:18.000
And honestly, I think that it's wise to come out with what they have because it seems very non-reactionary.

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:23.000
You know, there's some places who are like, oh, I'm losing my shit. Here's big knee-jerk reaction.

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:26.000
We have to combat this now without looking long-term.

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:36.000
And I think in this case, sometimes rivals can come together for mutual self-preservation.

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:37.000
That make sense?

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:47.000
You know, something that even though they are in competition in some fields, overall it will benefit the both of them better if only humans could do that.

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:50.000
Politics. But still.

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:56.000
Going to chat for some other comments because Kaijuto in chat says, if games go streaming only, I'm out.

01:16:56.000 --> 01:17:02.000
You know, I don't want to say, you know, pack your bags, but I think you have many years.

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:07.000
I think, again, this is a lot of tea leaf reading for many years down the line.

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:11.000
This is not something I think that's going to affect right away anyway the next generation of games.

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:19.000
The fact maybe that Sony is looking to partner with Microsoft's cloud services as opposed to, say, Amazon's or another, you know, building their own.

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:24.000
I suppose that is an interesting feature that could have some type of effect on PlayStation 5.

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:28.000
But as far as like gaming going completely into the cloud, I don't think we're there yet.

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:35.000
But as we talked about, you know, a lot of parallels to when we had this show right after Google made their announcement about Stadia.

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:38.000
You know, I think in many ways, I don't want to retread that ground too much.

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:48.000
But I think in many ways, just like the movie industry has very much gone to this Netflix, Disney, Hulu, CBS, NBC.

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:50.000
Disney took over Hulu now, didn't they?

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:53.000
I know, right, but yet they're keeping it separate services. What?

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:55.000
You know, I wonder how long that's going to last.

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:57.000
But anyway, I want to get into movie talk.

01:17:57.000 --> 01:18:06.000
But you can kind of see that when the industries kind of go in there for that direction, that gaming could be looking at a similar future.

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:10.000
Now, I mean, does that mean that the need for physical media is going to be gone forever?

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:14.000
Not necessarily. I mean, Blu-rays are still a thing for collectibles.

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:17.000
Going to see a movie at a theater is still a thing.

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:22.000
But even in the theater, do you know how much of that is kind of cloud-based theater?

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:24.000
I know that sounds really weird.

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:28.000
But do you know how like movies are kind of like downloaded basically to projectors?

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:33.000
That's kind of how things work now to avoid getting leaked early.

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:39.000
And also, I mean, the whole, you guys know like the Fathom Events thing. What the hell do you think that is?

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:42.000
It's witchcraft is what it is.

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:51.000
It's movie theaters in the cloud, right? The cloud is, all it is, is just like, it's the internet, right?

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:58.000
Yeah, pretty much. I mean, so with the Fathom Events, let's say they're doing a night at the, or what do they do?

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:01.000
They do the classic, yeah, the opera stuff.

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:06.000
Yeah, and I went and saw Karate Kid a few weeks ago, and we saw Ghostbusters last year.

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:09.000
So they show like an interview with the celebrities before him, right?

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:14.000
So that's beaming out of some theater in Los Angeles, and it's beaming into all these movie theaters.

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:18.000
It's like, I flat out asked him, he's like, I don't trust the cloud thing. What about the internet? Do you trust that?

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:21.000
Yeah, same thing. Really the same thing.

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:24.000
And Kajuda says, stream it as an alternative is fine. Do what you want.

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:28.000
But once I can't buy a game CD or buy a game digitally, I'm out.

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:31.000
And I, you know, I think it's too early to say, you know, we'll-

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:34.000
You're never not going to be able to buy a game. It's just, it's going to be-

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:37.000
In these, I think we'll always kind of still have that market too.

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:42.000
Because if it's not working, if not, everyone's going to do it. Now everyone's going to, there's not going to be all of a sudden the law says,

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:47.000
sorry, this is the only way you can release games now. You can't do it any other way.

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:52.000
So I think as far as Kajuda, as far as your statement goes, which I'm sure you're not alone in what you're thinking there,

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:57.000
is that it is nice to, when you pay $60 for something, have something physical in your hand that you can touch.

01:19:57.000 --> 01:20:02.000
Like that, I get that. That is nice to have, right? Because in this day and age, we've heard too much of,

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:06.000
you bought something digitally and then poof, the game went away, as did your money, poof, it's gone.

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:11.000
It evaporated into the cloud. Bye-bye. Yes, I get it. I mean, I get it.

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:16.000
But it's just going to be interesting to see kind of like where the industry sort of goes with that.

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:22.000
But I think it'll be more like, you know, the AAA games. Or maybe using the cloud as a support.

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:30.000
You know, maybe you still will have a physical disk, but the actual PlayStation 6, again, I'm totally like theorizing here,

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:36.000
maybe uses the cloud to do some of the difficult computations. Who knows?

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:41.000
Yes, such difficult computations like Crackdown 3's multiplayer, which no one plays anymore.

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:48.000
Exactly. Let's see, YYR in chat says the cloud just means someone else's computer.

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:54.000
Essentially, essentially. Or maybe like a bunch of supercomputers all tied together. But anyway.

01:20:54.000 --> 01:21:00.000
And the other good news is, Kaijuto, is that if you're a Nintendo fan, I guarantee you,

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:05.000
Nintendo will be last to the party on whatever this is. So, if you're a Nintendo fan,

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:11.000
you're going to have like just a built-in five more years before they go to it, just by default.

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:17.000
So, you do have that. I guess so. Enjoy it. Anyway, let's move on. Loki, what do you have for our next story?

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:20.000
I'm sorry, we did get everything out that we wanted to say about that. Okay, just making sure.

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:24.000
I want to make sure we didn't tangent in the middle of the story. Loki, what do we have next?

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:26.000
So, this is something that looks pretty awesome that I need to try.

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:31.000
So, you know how they have all these wonderful Twitch streams that do different things with games,

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:37.000
usually with some more viewer interactivity. So, they have a new extension now called Crowd Control,

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:43.000
which allows players to be able to interact with the streamer's games in different ways.

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:53.000
So, for example, in Super Mario Bros. 3, you can spend a small number of bits to spawn items or enemies in the game.

01:21:53.000 --> 01:22:02.000
Or they may have it where you can do something with a randomizer or something to that effect.

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:07.000
So, right now they have the software controls several different games.

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:12.000
So, they have 12 games supported. Dark Souls, Mega Man 2, Mega Man 3, Mega Man 4, Mega Man 8,

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:21.000
Mega Man X, Pokemon Red and Blue, Super Mario Bros. 3, Super Mario Bros. 64, Super Mario World, Super Metroid,

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:25.000
Legend of Zelda, Link of the Past, Randomizer are all supported.

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:27.000
I kind of want to get in on this. This sounds really fun.

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:28.000
It does sound like fun.

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:32.000
Yeah, I love the interactive stuff on Twitch. That's what makes Twitch so much more exciting,

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:35.000
which is why we invite you to participate with our show on Sunday nights.

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:39.000
Which, by the way, I hate to tangent, but I have to say, I'm going to say it once,

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:46.000
but apparently that show that we've been up against pretty regularly on Sunday nights just finished.

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:51.000
I'm not going to spoil, but apparently it's all over social media at this point.

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:54.000
What's going on? Because all I asked, because I don't watch the show,

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:57.000
I put, are people pissed at it like the last two episodes?

01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:59.000
Because the last two episodes weren't very well received.

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:01.000
Are people pissed at it like the last two episodes?

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:02.000
That's all I want to know.

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:04.000
And Bobby says yes.

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:05.000
Quest Buster says yes.

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:06.000
Don't say anything.

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:07.000
I know, don't say anything.

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:09.000
He's waiting for the butt.

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:10.000
I need to go see it at home.

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:13.000
That's all I wanted to know. Are people pissed off?

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:17.000
Are we going to have days and days? Did Silky win Drag Race?

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:19.000
Are we going to have that kind of meltdown going on?

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:20.000
I know the answer.

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:23.000
I know, I know. I know those spoilers are out there too.

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:26.000
I can't wait because I know my expectations are so low,

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:31.000
and I'm waiting to be disappointed, but I need to do that at my own time.

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:35.000
I don't want to be spoiled because I want to be like, really? Is that what they did?

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:37.000
That's all I'm going to say. That's all I'm going to say about that.

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:41.000
I never derail for that, but I have to admit, coming into tonight's show,

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:43.000
I knew we were up against that goddamn finale,

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:46.000
and all I want to know is, are people going to be pissed at it?

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:49.000
Is it going to be like a Sopranos kind of ending where people are fucking pissed at it?

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:51.000
Oh, they're already mad after the last episode.

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:52.000
I know.

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:57.000
But you know, my thought was maybe it was kind of like a couple subpar episodes

01:23:57.000 --> 01:24:00.000
because the finale is like, oh shit.

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:02.000
It was all set up for a finale.

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:05.000
It's more like, oh, X-Men Origins Wolverine.

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:09.000
Yeah, now it sounds like, oh, they took a shit. That's too bad.

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:11.000
They're like, oh, we want to work on something else.

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:14.000
Maybe they should have waited for him to finish the book. That's too bad.

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:17.000
All right, anyway, new topic. Back to games. Sorry, back to Twitch.

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:19.000
Anyways, so yeah, that sounds really awesome.

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:21.000
I've seen other things that people have done.

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:24.000
I don't know if it's other extensions that they build,

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:28.000
but I've seen one, there's a guy that does speed runs

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:32.000
of Grand Theft Auto San Andreas this way

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:35.000
where people are spawning and crap all over.

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:39.000
It's all sorts of crazy, but he'll play that for like eight hours

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:43.000
or several hours at a time with all this crazy shit going on at the same time

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:46.000
trying to play through the game with cars exploding and stuff.

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:51.000
So yes, I want to watch this, and I want to do this.

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:54.000
Yeah, I'm going to look into this when I get back from my trip

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:56.000
because I think this would be a really good incentive

01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:58.000
for me to do more streaming on my personal channel too,

01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:00.000
which I admittedly have been slipping on a little bit.

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:03.000
But I know we wanted to do some more stuff on our VoG channel too

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:05.000
just so we have more stuff outside of just Sundays

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:08.000
and the hosting of Anime Jam Session on Tuesdays.

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:10.000
We want to do some more content, so this might be fun.

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:11.000
Yeah.

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:13.000
All right, cool. All right.

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:17.000
Well, moving on to a follow-up from, I think it was last week's show

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:20.000
when we talked about the big walkout that happened at Riot Games

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:23.000
where I think it was about 150 employees kind of walked out,

01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:25.000
and Riot Games kind of had to play it off

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:27.000
because they know the whole world's watching us all.

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:30.000
It's cool. They can do the thing. They have to riot.

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:33.000
We support your decision to protest.

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:35.000
Well, an interesting kind of follow-up came up here

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:40.000
is that Riot Games apparently, because I guess originally they said

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:43.000
that as soon as current litigation was over,

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:47.000
it would give new rioters the choice to opt out of mandatory arbitration

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:50.000
for individual sexual harassment and sexual assault claims,

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:53.000
and then they would determine from there whether that opt-out

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:55.000
would apply to everyone and so forth.

01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:57.000
So here's what they've come out and said.

01:25:57.000 --> 01:26:00.000
So Riot put out a statement this week that said,

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:03.000
ultimately, given the complexities of ongoing litigation,

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:08.000
we will not change our employee agreements while in active litigation.

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:10.000
We know not everyone agrees with this decision,

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:14.000
but we also know everyone does want Riot to continue to improve.

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:17.000
We remain committed to having a firm answer around extending an opt-out

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:20.000
to all rioters when active litigation concludes.

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:22.000
Everything we've heard will impact our discussions

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:25.000
when we revisit arbitration, and we hope to have an answer

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:27.000
that will be satisfying to everyone.

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:31.000
At a minimum, we will give new rioters the option to opt out of arbitration

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:34.000
on individual sexual harassment claims.

01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:38.000
So it sounds like some of those people protesting

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:41.000
are not going to get one of the things that they were asking for there.

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:45.000
So this might be the start of something,

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:49.000
because it was kind of mentioned in that walkout

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:53.000
that if they don't kind of relent to some of the demands,

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:55.000
this is going to escalate.

01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:57.000
They won't talk about what that escalation is,

01:26:57.000 --> 01:27:00.000
but I can certainly fantasize what some of that could be.

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:03.000
I mean, we could talk about employees quitting en masse,

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:05.000
starting a new company.

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:10.000
I have a feeling, and this would be a tricky thing,

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:13.000
but I think one of, especially in the video game industry,

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:18.000
I think one of a company's most valuable assets is its secrets.

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:21.000
And I think what you're going to see happen,

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:25.000
this is just a guess, but I think in the coming weeks,

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:27.000
if employees don't start getting what they want,

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:29.000
you're going to see some big expos.

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:31.000
It's going to have to all be anonymous and stuff,

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:33.000
but you're going to know about everything riot's doing,

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:36.000
because the employees are going to be demotivated

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:38.000
and not wanting to keep the secrets and stuff.

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:39.000
They're going to start blabbing.

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:42.000
And so we're going to start finding out what else has riot been working on,

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:44.000
what other heroes are under creation.

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:45.000
That's just a guess.

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:47.000
Again, I don't know anything.

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:50.000
I'm just thinking, what could escalation be?

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:55.000
And I think that is certainly one place where if you tick off enough people

01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:58.000
that know your secrets and know what poker cards you're holding,

01:27:58.000 --> 01:27:59.000
that could be a dangerous game.

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:01.000
The people are also the biggest asset.

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:05.000
There is no company without the people who work for it.

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:08.000
And a lot of companies have forgotten this.

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:14.000
If you invest in your employees and you make it a good place to work

01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:18.000
and you keep them happy and you get a return on your investment,

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:21.000
you might put more in, but you get more back.

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:24.000
That's why I'm happy for where I work.

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:27.000
They put a lot into us and they pay us great and, well,

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:29.000
we're mostly pretty happy.

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:32.000
It's the same thing.

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:35.000
If you are treating your employees like garbage,

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:37.000
you're going to get garbage back.

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:40.000
I'm pretty lucky in the places where I've worked and in my current job.

01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:42.000
I have a super understanding boss.

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:45.000
If I have to take care of personal things or what have you,

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:50.000
I'm able to have an extreme work-life balance in what I do.

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:52.000
Granted, I don't work in the gaming industry,

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:54.000
but I have an amazing work-life balance,

01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:57.000
and I think that is one of the biggest keys to having happy employees, for sure.

01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:59.000
I do want to read some comments in chat.

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:01.000
Bobby Blackwell says, regarding journalists,

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:04.000
apparently CD Projekt Red reached out to Kotaku

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:08.000
to get ahead of a crunch time story for Cyberpunk 2077,

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:10.000
Derek Freight of the Exposé.

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:13.000
I do remember seeing a story about how Cyberpunk and that development,

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:16.000
they put out a statement basically saying

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:19.000
that they are not going to be doing crunch time,

01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:23.000
or that there will be crunch time, but it really will be voluntary,

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:26.000
and this is how they're going to make sure that people are not penalized

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:29.000
if they're not able to work it, or it's only during certain times.

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:32.000
They basically tried to put out a statement

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:35.000
on what they say crunch time is going to be

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:39.000
before there's an exposé about what it's been in the past sort of thing.

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:42.000
It's very interesting how this is affecting all these different gaming companies.

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:43.000
It's not just Riot.

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:46.000
If you feel guilty about the practice, maybe you shouldn't be doing it.

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:47.000
Yeah, yeah.

01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:52.000
Anyway, I think it's going to be very interesting to see where this goes from here.

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:57.000
I mean, it's unfortunate that it's going to escalate from here.

01:29:57.000 --> 01:30:00.000
I mean, don't get me, I'm not celebrating that,

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:04.000
but it's going to be interesting to see what consequences this has,

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:07.000
not just for Riot Games, but for the industry.

01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:09.000
So, you know, we're all keeping our eyes on that.

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:12.000
So, that being said, let's move on to our next story, Dark Soccer.

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:19.000
Well, this, now, I'm going to specify this is information

01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:22.000
coming from the World Health Organization, or WHO.

01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:29.000
Anyway, video game addiction is possibly going to be recognized

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:32.000
as an official disease by the World Health Organization.

01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:37.000
They're actually going to be voting on it this upcoming week,

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:42.000
and it comes from a body of evidence showing that young gamers face psychological distress

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:48.000
as a result of playing games and getting hooked on them or addicted behavior.

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:52.000
And I'll put it this way, it's the same as with any drug or any activity

01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:58.000
that produces a chemical effect in the body, the same as with gambling.

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:05.000
You know, anything that does that nice little serotonin, dopamine release in the body

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:10.000
and makes you feel good about it, people can become addicted to that feeling

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:14.000
and keep doing the activities that generate that, right?

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:18.000
And so, when you are removing that from your life,

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:23.000
you are going through very real chemical withdrawal, end of story.

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:27.000
It's not all in your head, your body's chemicals are making this shit happen.

01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:30.000
That's why some people are more prone to addiction than others.

01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:39.000
But there's studies that show MRI scans that show a link between depression and video game addiction,

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:44.000
the same way that people react to drug abuse or alcoholism.

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:55.000
They were saying that WHO made a decision to put video gaming as a mental disorder

01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:59.000
as part of their 11th revision of international classification diseases,

01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:03.000
which I don't agree with, but they listed it as a disorder,

01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:08.000
as a pattern of gaming behavior characterized by impaired control over gaming,

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:13.000
where basically they're putting their priority on gaming as opposed to other activities.

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:16.000
We've heard of the WoW Widows, right?

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:20.000
Oh, yeah. My pal Arya Snark says she was one.

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:23.000
She said, my boyfriend wouldn't go out with me

01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:26.000
because he was, quote, storming the castle.

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:35.000
Well, at any rate, so there actually is, it's NHS National Health Service, UK,

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:43.000
actually has now, it's funding a game addiction center for children to seek treatment.

01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:51.000
And there are people who will admit that, yeah, they were gaming addicts,

01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:55.000
that their life fell apart and that they had to seek help.

01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:58.000
But the same also goes, it's the same as gambling addiction.

01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:02.000
It's the same as being addicted to a drug.

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:10.000
It's not in your head, like I said, it is a true disorder.

01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:18.000
It is your body reacting in a chemical manner to either an activity or a substance that you are putting in it.

01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:20.000
You become addicted to the feeling.

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:26.000
And in some cases, once you're used to having produced these level of chemicals in your body,

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:31.000
of course, you're going to need to continue the activity to continue producing these chemicals.

01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:37.000
Also, love produces the same addictive quality.

01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:40.000
And that's where the term seven-year itch comes from,

01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:45.000
that on average for people find that those chemicals...

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:47.000
There's a lot of things you can get addicted to.

01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:48.000
Sex is one of them.

01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:49.000
No, not me.

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:55.000
I know, but there's like David Duchovny, I believe, was a famous actor that went to rehab for sex addiction.

01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:59.000
Like it's a thing that can, you know, all these, you can get addicted to a lot of things.

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:03.000
Food, food's another good one because again, you're getting a hormonal release from it.

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:11.000
But at any rate, I mean, it's, I'm glad that they are doing this.

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:12.000
I really am.

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:17.000
Because that means that we'll have a hopefully better, you know,

01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:20.000
implements out there to help people deal with these things.

01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:24.000
I mean, like, I know Microsoft put out something that said they were trying to put more parental controls in.

01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:29.000
One thing I was really happy about is there are like, for computers now,

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:32.000
more parental controls that also limit how much time.

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:34.000
It's like the screen time thing on the iPhone.

01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:38.000
You know, you can limit how much time someone is using the device.

01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:45.000
You know, for kids who are like, no, I want to play all the Fortnite ever, as an example.

01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:50.000
But at the same time, it sets a control and gives time for a calm down.

01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:54.000
And I really do think, it goes back to everything in moderation,

01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:57.000
but there are some people who cannot self-moderate.

01:34:57.000 --> 01:35:01.000
Yeah. No, and you know, as much as you might think I'm going to sit here and argue

01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:06.000
because I'm a gaming enthusiast that, oh, this is just them trying to shame the industry and all this stuff.

01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:09.000
No, I mean, video game addiction, that can be a real thing.

01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:11.000
I mean, I think we recognize that.

01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:12.000
It's activity addiction.

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:14.000
There's a lot of things that you can get addicted to in the world,

01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:16.000
and video games can certainly be one of them.

01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:19.000
I mean, there's been times in my life where I've even kind of looked and went,

01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:22.000
whoa, whoa, guy, you need to pull it back on some of these games.

01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:24.000
Like you're playing this game way too much.

01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:25.000
Right.

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:29.000
You know, in some ways, like Pokemon Go and Ingress and those games, you know,

01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:32.000
I used to play a lot of Ingress, but then I kind of recognized like,

01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:37.000
I definitely had that what does it fucking matter moment, you know, and I scaled it way back.

01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:40.000
Yeah, that's exactly it is that, you know,

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:43.000
it takes a turnaround in your own head to recognize that there's a problem.

01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:44.000
Right.

01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:47.000
And the moment that you do, the moment that you see it,

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:50.000
and sometimes you need someone else helping you to point it out to you

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:54.000
or another little trigger that says, hey, look, you've been playing.

01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:58.000
Let me think of something else a lot of people are playing.

01:35:58.000 --> 01:35:59.000
Fortnite.

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:00.000
Okay. Fortnite again.

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:01.000
Okay. Fortnite again.

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:03.000
You've been playing Fortnite for 11 hours.

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:06.000
Maybe it's time to, it's the cat paw.

01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:07.000
Stop posting.

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:08.000
Stop playing.

01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:10.000
You know, it's just.

01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:12.000
Speaking of the cat paw, I saw Mr. Smoosh was.

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:13.000
He's got his foot in the air.

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:14.000
He's been doing.

01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:16.000
He's been just off cam right now.

01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:17.000
He's doing the booty licks.

01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:18.000
Relaxing. Yeah.

01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:23.000
But at any rate, you know, there comes a point where if you can't do it for yourself,

01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:25.000
someone's going to have to do it for you.

01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:26.000
Yeah.

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:29.000
And that's why I think it's good that this decision is being made,

01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:31.000
that there's going to be literature that goes out.

01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:37.000
You know, the one thing is that you can be a fan of something and still take a very critical eye to it.

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:41.000
In fact, I think that's what makes a better fan.

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:43.000
I like to think that's what this show is.

01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:44.000
Yeah.

01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:45.000
When we're critical of things.

01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:46.000
Girl, it's us.

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:47.000
Yeah, it's us.

01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:53.000
But anyway, but my, but my thought about it is, is like, you know, for example, I'm going to use David Bowie.

01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:54.000
Okay.

01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:57.000
David Bowie, amazing, amazing artist.

01:36:57.000 --> 01:37:00.000
Such a visionary, right?

01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:03.000
But he also slept with an underage girl.

01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:10.000
We can look at that problematic behavior and still recognize that he was a creative genius.

01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:12.000
You know, we can do that.

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:21.000
That is what I think makes the truest of fans is when you're not just accepting everything blindly like religion.

01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:25.000
It's good when you can follow a religion and still take a critical eye toward it.

01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:27.000
That way you make it better.

01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:28.000
Same with video games.

01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:29.000
Same with anything.

01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:32.000
And I really that's why I'm glad about this.

01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:34.000
I really am glad about it.

01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:44.000
You know, I, I'm going to go into a rant on this one because like for you, for example, you know, I'm active in our local LGBT community.

01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:45.000
I support them.

01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:51.000
I do a lot of work and I can still point out the rampant misogyny going on in the community right now.

01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:52.000
Oh, sure.

01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:53.000
Oh, my God.

01:37:53.000 --> 01:38:07.000
Like, and one thing maybe you haven't seen, but I've certainly seen firsthand, like if you go on to like meeting people on gay apps, like, you know, the grinders, the scruffs, things of that world, you see like racism, you know, gender.

01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:08.000
No fats, no femmes, no Asians.

01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:09.000
Oh, absolutely.

01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:10.000
That's a real thing.

01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:12.000
That's not like just some things a queen said on Drag Race.

01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:18.000
They said that because that is a thing people will put on their profiles or, you know, like, you know, please no black guys.

01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:20.000
Or what the hell is that?

01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:22.000
Or don't be HIV positive.

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:23.000
Yeah.

01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:24.000
That's another big one.

01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:25.000
It's discriminatory.

01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:26.000
A clean guys only.

01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:27.000
Yeah.

01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:28.000
As if HIV is a dirty thing.

01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:29.000
You know what?

01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:31.000
Those people are fucking bigots and I will call them out on it.

01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:37.000
It sucks, you know, and maybe, maybe, well, I don't, there, I would, maybe I'm being too nice.

01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:38.000
I don't know.

01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:45.000
But I would say that as a person doing a bigoted thing that I would say probably 95% of those people you kind of educate, like, you know, when you say that it comes off.

01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:47.000
Would a non bigoted person say that?

01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:48.000
Exactly.

01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:54.000
And then you kind of point out, you know, the behavior of 95% of people I bet would say, oh, fuck, that's not what I meant, like, at all.

01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:55.000
And they're going to change that.

01:38:55.000 --> 01:39:01.000
There's going to be the 5% that are just fucking up their own ass and they're never, literally, and they're not going to change.

01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:09.000
And that's why me, I am a very public feminist in queer spaces because this attention is needed.

01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:13.000
And I feel the same way, you know, anything that I love, I'm going to work to try to make it better.

01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:19.000
And so I, I know people will be like, oh, well, if you support this thing, then you don't love video games.

01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:24.000
And like, no, I do it because I love video games and I want them to continue to be safe and fun for everybody.

01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:26.000
Can I give one other example?

01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:30.000
I know it's a little bit off topic, but I do think it's important, like talking about like the misogyny in gay culture.

01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:33.000
So have you ever heard of like a gold star gay?

01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:35.000
You know what a gold star gay is?

01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:38.000
A gold star gay is a gay that was born by C-section.

01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:41.000
Oh, didn't come out of the vagina.

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:45.000
So, you know, that's isn't that stupid?

01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:47.000
Yeah, I know that term.

01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:52.000
Right. Right. And now that you hear that and then when you hear that really is it's like that is the dumbest thing I've ever heard.

01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:58.000
People also treat cisgender male as the default in in language.

01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:05.000
There's a book I've been reading by an Australian scholar named Dale Spender.

01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:11.000
She's named Dale Spender, by the way, called Man Made Language, where language is used in a certain way.

01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:18.000
But anything that goes towards women are automatically considered nonstandard, different, negative.

01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:24.000
Like the word spinster, for an example, started from a woman who went to work for herself spinning.

01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:30.000
Now it's got this negative connotation of this woman unmarried who's never had babies or whatever.

01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:35.000
Just an example of that. But we look at being this one way as the default.

01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:37.000
So even anyway, I'm sorry.

01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:48.000
And I think it's important to point out that even within minorities, in this case, we're talking about, you know, with sexuality and sexual identity, even within those types of cultures, you can have issues that need to be worked on.

01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:52.000
It's not it's not just a cis white man problem.

01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:56.000
I mean, don't get this wrong. There's lots of problems there, too, but it's an everybody problem.

01:40:56.000 --> 01:41:00.000
I had a gay man grab my boob and says, it's OK, I'm gay. No, it's not.

01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:05.000
You touched me without my permission. And I hope you like my elbow in your gut.

01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:11.000
No, if anyone grabs me without my permission, I look at that as explicit permission for me to counter grab.

01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:14.000
Painfully. Just saying.

01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:18.000
You know, but anyway, you know, the other thing, too, like with with Alabama, I love my home state.

01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:22.000
I'm glad I grew up there, but it's fucking terrible what's going on.

01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:26.000
And I am pissed and I am going to be part of the uterine underground.

01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:30.000
Let me I'm sorry before we get off the rails too much. No, I want to get our next story in our classic of the week.

01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:34.000
But Bob Coffey asked an important question in chat that I think a lot of people don't know.

01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:38.000
So let's out of a place of love, let's educate. Let's assist. What is this gender male anyway?

01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:48.000
It just means it probably you. I'm going to guess you were assigned male at birth and maintained being male or female at birth and maintained being male.

01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:52.000
It's the opposite of transgender. That's it. So.

01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:58.000
And before people say that's a made up term, I'm sorry, they're both Latin suits.

01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:04.000
No, it's not made up anyhow. Oh, and and Pixel Pacas also said born.

01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:07.000
Oh, no, never mind, because I said male anyway. But yeah.

01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:15.000
So but it would mean you associate with the gender you were assigned to birth, which is, to be fair, most people.

01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:19.000
Yeah. And that doesn't but that doesn't mean if you're not one of those people, it's bad.

01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:26.000
It's just and and you can use that privilege that you have to help the people who do not have that privilege.

01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:31.000
All right. Anyway, sorry. I know this talking about video game addiction.

01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:34.000
Yes, I know. No, it's but it also goes about our lives, too.

01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:38.000
But it also goes back to supporting the things you love in a constructive manner.

01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:40.000
Yeah. You and I deal with this stuff all the time.

01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:47.000
Me as a gay guy, you as someone who has talked about your asexuality on the show and the assumptions that people make with that, like it's a, you know, a big deal.

01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:51.000
So anyway, let's move on, though. And one last thing.

01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:57.000
Yeah. Bones 006 says, I find it funny that a gay male or female can grab and touch the other gender and claim it's OK because I am gay.

01:42:57.000 --> 01:43:02.000
It is not OK. It is never OK. And you see that happen. You call it the fuck out.

01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:09.000
Yeah, no, it's it's. Do you remember on. OK, so you guys know I'm a reality TV nerd, right?

01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:15.000
So I like shows like Survivor. So they're going to be doing an all winners edition.

01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:21.000
Season 40 is coming up where all the winners are going to be like some of the winners are going to be asked to play, but not all of them got asked back.

01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:26.000
And one of the winners, apparently, if spoilers are to be believed, did not get asked back is the original winner, Richard Hatch.

01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:31.000
And some people were wondering, why was he not asked back? And somebody very eloquently pointed out on Reddit.

01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:42.000
Do you remember when he came back for All-Stars and he's a gay guy, by the way, when he came back on All-Stars, he was he did a challenge naked and rubbed his parts against a woman to throw her off her game.

01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:49.000
So. Oh, my God. Right. So that's disgusting. Right. That is the reason he was not asked back.

01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:57.000
Because he's a disgusting person. It was not a nice thing. No. Anyone who does something like that without consent, you are immediately the scum of the earth.

01:43:57.000 --> 01:44:00.000
And it's sorry, as you know, Matt says, I forgot about that.

01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:05.000
But a lot of people did because All-Stars was on in what, like two thousand four.

01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:10.000
It was a long time ago because what survivors started what, two thousand, I think the first All-Star season was like two thousand three, two thousand four.

01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:16.000
We weren't talking about this shit then. But thanks to, you know, the Me Too movement and things like that, we're talking about it more now.

01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:18.000
You know, the show dealt with it in its own way back then.

01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:23.000
I did with all the people who said that I need to stop talking and go back to the kitchen.

01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:27.000
Guess who's still here. Seventeen years later, bitches.

01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:32.000
You know what? I may not have as much left to my ass as I did when I started, but y'all can bite it.

01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:35.000
All right. Unless, you know, you have to ask first.

01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:38.000
Let's move on. Let's move on. There's plenty more to talk about.

01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:42.000
Loki, let's talk about Pokemon. Pokemon games, games, Pokemon, Pokemon game.

01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:51.000
Yes. So Pokemon Rumble Rush is a game that's going to be coming to iOS and Android soon.

01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:58.000
Yeah. And right now the official Japanese site says it's coming soon.

01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:06.000
But apparently other regions have the game is coming out in those areas as well.

01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:14.000
And there's even a description on the Google Play Store talking about, you know, enjoy fast paced gameplay on the go.

01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:19.000
And they talk about the different Pokemon you can upgrade and explore areas and stuff like that.

01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:22.000
I've never played Pokemon Rumble. Isn't that the one that has the toy?

01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:25.000
It's basically the toy Pokemon or something like that.

01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:28.000
Like the kind of blocky ones. Right. Yeah.

01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:32.000
That's right. Yeah. They had. Well, there was that one, too.

01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:37.000
Yeah. They kind of look like little toys, I guess, if I remember correctly.

01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:41.000
But so we kind of had heard rumblings about this like last week.

01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:43.000
Right. Because didn't we hear that? Well, we heard that there was a new game.

01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:47.000
I don't know if this is the other game that's being made by that one company.

01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:52.000
Another other game or another other. Yes, exactly. Or a different game altogether.

01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:58.000
So I don't know, because I would think it's weird that like we're announcing this partnership that we're going to make this game.

01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:00.000
And then like the very next week, we're going to announce the game.

01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:04.000
And you think you would just wait the week and now it's the game.

01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:10.000
But we'll have to wait and see if there's anything else that's coming.

01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:13.000
But I don't know. I'll check it out. I'm assuming it's gonna be free.

01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:18.000
Yeah. So, yeah, you know, the free free to start is always a good way to sample.

01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:22.000
I was like really into the other Pokemon game for a while.

01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:28.000
I don't remember what was on the the switch and then it was also on Android as well.

01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:32.000
And I played that quite a bit, but then I stopped because I got bored with it.

01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:37.000
Shane is in our chat, Shad, saying Pokemon Rush is out in like Australia.

01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:40.000
It's kind of like a Diablo and Skylanders just killed tons and tons of enemies.

01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:42.000
Rumble has always been a fun game, though.

01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:44.000
Well, that sounds just like the...

01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:46.000
I don't know about the Australia, New Zealand people get all the cool mobile phone games.

01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:47.000
Well, what's the other Pokemon game?

01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:52.000
Because there's the other Pokemon game that you have like a group of Pokemon and you go and just kill enemies and stuff.

01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:55.000
Yeah, it was on like 3DS. It was like a Diablo-esque type of game.

01:46:55.000 --> 01:46:58.000
No, no, no, no. I'm talking about like the there's one that was on the switch.

01:46:58.000 --> 01:47:01.000
It was a Pokemon game and they also have it on Android and iOS now.

01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:03.000
But I remember it was called like the QB like...

01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:05.000
Yeah. No, I know what you're talking about and I forget.

01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:06.000
This is like different, but the same.

01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:07.000
Yeah.

01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:08.000
I guess.

01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:11.000
All right. Oh, Pokemon Quest says Frodo.

01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:13.000
Yes, yes, yes. Pokemon Quest.

01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:14.000
Thank you, chat.

01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:16.000
This is why we love having a live chat because they can live.

01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:17.000
They can fact check us live on air.

01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:22.000
Sometimes it's annoying, admittedly, but at the same time, you know, it keeps us keeps us real.

01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:23.000
So what can we do?

01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:24.000
All right.

01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:25.000
Let's move on.

01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:32.000
And before we get to our classic soundtrack of the month, because we're almost out of time in May with this being our last show in May, believe it or not, we got to get the soundtrack.

01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:34.000
But before we do, I got one more story.

01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:36.000
And it's about Netflix, which I brought up earlier in the show.

01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:44.000
But, you know, Netflix, they not only have lots and lots of new shows, they keep seeing ads for new shows, but they're kind of getting into gaming as well.

01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:47.000
In fact, we know that a Stranger Things game is on the way.

01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:49.000
That's that's not news that has already been out there.

01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:53.000
We knew that a Stranger Things game was coming out around the time that season three starts in July.

01:47:53.000 --> 01:48:01.000
But apparently because brands are hip and cool on Twitter now and they interact with each other on social media, which is weird.

01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:09.000
But due to a recent social media interaction where E3's replied to Netflix saying, sounds great, can we get a hint about the game?

01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:16.000
Netflix replied saying, of course, there's the upcoming Stranger Things game, but hmm, there's definitely more to come.

01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:20.000
So it seems like Netflix could be unveiling other games.

01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:24.000
I would love like if they're like, can we get a hint about the new game?

01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:27.000
They're like, no, fuck off.

01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:29.000
If the brands responded that way.

01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:30.000
Saying who the fuck are you?

01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:33.000
Yeah, no. So who knows what Netflix might be working on?

01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:36.000
Maybe a Black Mirror video game. That would be pretty rad, actually.

01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:40.000
I'd be so as much as it would probably terrify me, like I'd be into that.

01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:45.000
Or, well, they have the new season, which is like three fucking episodes coming.

01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:47.000
Yeah, but then it's three episodes. Come on.

01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:54.000
There was that Bandersnatch thing, too, which is kind of a game, kind of a game, kind of very, very rudimentary.

01:48:54.000 --> 01:48:58.000
But yes, I mean, in some ways, I'm trying to think what else on Netflix would be.

01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:02.000
I think what else on Netflix would kind of lend itself to being maybe Nailed It, the home version.

01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:09.000
Why not? We had all those like we have that they have like these.

01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:15.000
They seriously have like a cooking simulator game that's like VR that is basically nailed at the video game.

01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:19.000
You can like actually set fire to the kitchen if you're not.

01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:22.000
I just want a game where Nicole Byer narrates my life.

01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:26.000
What is he doing?

01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:29.000
I can't believe he's fucking that up again.

01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:32.000
I just want a game where she narrates my life because I love it.

01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:41.000
I want like an adult version, not like, you know, but like an adult language version of like one of those cooking shows.

01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:43.000
What the fuck are you doing right now?

01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:45.000
So you want Hell's Kitchen Uncensored.

01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:47.000
Yes. Yes.

01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:50.000
But like with just other people, you know, making cakes.

01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:57.000
Something that's very like, you know, shouldn't be something that people are getting super mad over, but they are getting super mad over it.

01:49:57.000 --> 01:50:01.000
As this Joe and Hunter Matt says, Overcooked can end up being like Nailed It.

01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:05.000
Who knows? That's that's my vote for Netflix show I'd like to see a game made out of.

01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:09.000
All right. Anyway, let's go. You know what? Let's go back to a simpler time.

01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:17.000
We're going to go back to a time when, you know, video games were not based on streaming technology because you know how you watch movies and shows.

01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:20.000
You rented them on VHS from Blockbuster.

01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:24.000
It's the classic Game of the Week segment. But once a month, Dark Soccer says, you know what?

01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:29.000
I'm going to mix it up a little bit. And instead of doing a whole game, I want to talk about a soundtrack.

01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:34.000
I want to focus on a spotlight on a soundtrack. And I believe the rule was in twenty nineteen.

01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:37.000
She's going to be focusing on 8-bit soundtrack specifically.

01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:41.000
I am. And let's see, in January we had a Nintendo game. We had a Nintendo game in February, Nintendo game in March.

01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:44.000
So what Nintendo game did you do this month? I didn't.

01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:45.000
The Gasp.

01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:47.000
And in fact, next month's also will not be.

01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:50.000
I see. All right. Well, then what did you pick for the classic soundtrack of the month?

01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:56.000
Wonder Boy 3, the Dragon's Trap, which actually is, I'd say, pretty timely.

01:50:56.000 --> 01:51:02.000
We've had other Wonder Boy. We've had that Wonder Boy re-release of this game that had very good versions of the music.

01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:07.000
That was really like one of my favorite retro re-releases they've done. They did such a good job with that.

01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:18.000
Well, at any rate, the music designer for this was Sakamoto Shimichi, who actually spent a lot of time working for Westone.

01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:27.000
And he also helped program NMK's NES sound driver and programmed his own.

01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:30.000
Right now he's doing audio for smartphone games, just saying.

01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:35.000
But he has worked on a lot of great music, a lot of great games.

01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:38.000
There was Star Force, of course, Wonder Boy in Monster Land.

01:51:38.000 --> 01:51:44.000
Bikuriman World for PC Engine, he's done other Wonder Boy games.

01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:46.000
He's actually done several Wonder Boy games.

01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:52.000
Dragon's Curse, you know, just all kinds of really neat games.

01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:57.000
But at any rate, the music for this game really stands out with it.

01:51:57.000 --> 01:52:03.000
Because it was really one of the outstanding things with this game.

01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:10.000
When the Games Machine did their... I'm sorry, not the Games Machine.

01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:20.000
Raze actually did a review of this. They noted that the music was worth listening through headphones.

01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:27.000
And, of course, the music was referred to as incredibly addictive by other places.

01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:35.000
Because it really has been that the music for this game fit the play so well that the two could not go without each other.

01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:41.000
And I think that one of the selections that I had chosen to play back was the FM soundtrack.

01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:44.000
This is definitely one of those games that had...

01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:47.000
And for people who don't know this, which I don't know how you couldn't know this,

01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:56.000
but Master System in Japan had another sound processor that was their FM sound processor.

01:52:56.000 --> 01:53:03.000
And so they had basically better soundtracks for the games, more channels to play the music through.

01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:07.000
Where what we got from Master System over here was just kind of dinky.

01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:09.000
It wasn't bad, just kind of dinky.

01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:15.000
And, of course, if you were playing through a power-based converter, then it wouldn't play games in FM sound.

01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:20.000
There are, of course, third-party power-based converters now that will play in FM sound.

01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:21.000
We have one.

01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:30.000
But Monster Boy, this particular game, was not one that works in one of those FM-compatible power-based converters.

01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:34.000
You have to play it on an FM-capable machine.

01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:39.000
So at any rate, you know, this is also...

01:53:39.000 --> 01:53:47.000
I would even go on record saying that this is probably some of the pinnacle of Master System game music right here.

01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:52.000
This is really one of the games that set apart what soundtracks could be like on Master System.

01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:59.000
And I do want to point out, because the chat room was kind of disgusting, wait a minute, wasn't this on the TurboGrafx-16?

01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:00.000
Yes.

01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:02.000
Is that really 8-bit? But we're talking about the Master System right now.

01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:03.000
I'm talking about the Master System 1.

01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:05.000
That's just the gameplay you're seeing too.

01:54:05.000 --> 01:54:10.000
And let's be real, this game has been remade so many times that, like you just said, it's on damn near everything now.

01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:14.000
It's the same designer did the PC Engine music, by the way.

01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:22.000
He did it for all of these versions of the games and the subsequent one, which was, I think, Wonder Boy in Monster...

01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:26.000
No, that was the prequel to this, Wonder Boy in Monster Land, and then we had the Dragon's Trap.

01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:32.000
But at any rate, that's all I can say is that it's got a really stellar soundtrack to it.

01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:36.000
Definitely something that I've just sat and listened to before because it was good.

01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:37.000
I've done that...

01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:42.000
You know, for me to sit and actually listen to the soundtrack all the way through, I really have to like every piece of it.

01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:46.000
And this is one of the ones that I do. So that's your classic soundtrack.

01:54:46.000 --> 01:54:55.000
Alright. And yeah, a good choice because, you know, Wonder Boy 3 again is one of those games you can kind of go back and enjoy.

01:54:55.000 --> 01:55:00.000
Not just on the TurboGrafx-16, but on basically all the modern day systems thanks to the remake.

01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:03.000
Look how pretty it is too. Just the graphics were amazing.

01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:09.000
Especially because a lot of Sega Master System games didn't look great, you know, but this one looks really good.

01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:17.000
Yeah, although one thing I do like about the Master System is that they had a better pastel palette than the NES did.

01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:20.000
NES was aimed a little bit more toward primary colors.

01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:27.000
Master System, like Fantasy Zone on Master System is, I think, better than Fantasy Zone on NES.

01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:28.000
That's it.

01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:34.000
Well there it is, your classic soundtrack of the month for Wonder Boy 3, the Dragon's Trap on the Sega Master System.

01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:38.000
To add one thing for DarkTetsuya, he says that the new game has the old visuals and music.

01:55:38.000 --> 01:55:47.000
Yes, but apart from that, not only does it have the Master System music that people in the US remember, it has FM sound in it as well.

01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:54.000
But it is, it also is a little deceiving because it also is kind of like built for widescreen when the original game wasn't.

01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:56.000
So it is cheating a little bit, but honestly...

01:55:56.000 --> 01:55:58.000
Well it's remade though, with the old style graphics.

01:55:58.000 --> 01:56:00.000
And I don't mind that at all, honestly.

01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:06.000
Like I would love to go back and play a lot of old retro games, like just kind of like rebuilt for modern TVs.

01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:12.000
And there's people who complain about the retooling of the soundtrack for the, you know, the newer version.

01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:16.000
I like it, so whatever. Stop complaining.

01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:20.000
I know just because you thought something was old was better, but look at WoW.

01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:35.000
Alright, well let's take a break. We're going to go to a pre-recorded segment that talks a little bit about Excitebike versus a new release that came out just this past week on the Nintendo NES Online for Nintendo Switch.

01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:46.000
Hey everybody, so for our OLR Break Segment this week, we're back on the classic Nintendo Entertainment System Online library available on the Nintendo Switch.

01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:53.000
To take a look at this month's game releases, which included a Classic Game of the Week from just a couple weeks ago.

01:56:53.000 --> 01:56:55.000
Clu Clu Land is in here, as well as Donkey Kong Jr.

01:56:55.000 --> 01:57:01.000
A special version of Star Soldier that starts you at the last level, because Star Soldier was one of last month's releases.

01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:07.000
And then we have Versus Excitebike, which is kind of the interesting release I wanted to talk about for this month.

01:57:07.000 --> 01:57:16.000
Because this isn't the first time that we've seen a Japanese-only game cross over into the North American Switch releases for the Nintendo system.

01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:23.000
Because we had that last month with Super Mario Bros. The Lost Levels, which as we know, was really just Super Mario Bros. 2 in Japan.

01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:28.000
So that's what it was released as. It's just basically the Super Mario Bros. 2 Japanese ROM.

01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:37.000
But released over here in North America as The Lost Levels, which was the branding that it had in Mario All-Stars back on the Super Nintendo.

01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:40.000
Although it had the reskinning of the game at that point too.

01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:47.000
But anyway, Mario Lost Levels is so last month at this point, so what I really want to talk about is Versus Excitebike.

01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:56.000
Because what makes this release interesting is that they could have just done regular Excitebike as we knew it here in the US.

01:57:56.000 --> 01:58:01.000
Which I believe was one of the original launch games for the Nintendo when it first came out.

01:58:01.000 --> 01:58:07.000
It was very soon after. It was one of those Black Pack releases, kind of like you see this Clu Clu Land over here.

01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:11.000
They all had that very unique art style. You guys kind of know the original NES releases.

01:58:11.000 --> 01:58:18.000
They didn't start looking very different until later on, which is why releases like Punch Out, Kirby, and some of those later releases had their own unique box art.

01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:23.000
But it looked a little more, you know, all those NES games kind of looked the same, and Excitebike was that way too.

01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:29.000
But Versus Excitebike was a Japanese Famicom disc game.

01:58:29.000 --> 01:58:37.000
And you know that right off the bat because the little icon that looks like one of those little yellow discs, the little mascot, is right there in the upper left hand corner.

01:58:37.000 --> 01:58:41.000
So that's how you know right off the bat that, hey, wait a minute, this is definitely a release.

01:58:41.000 --> 01:58:43.000
I mean, obviously the Japanese text as well, hello.

01:58:43.000 --> 01:58:46.000
But that's, you know, you kind of look at a few things there, like this is different.

01:58:46.000 --> 01:58:49.000
This is not the same release that we got in the US.

01:58:49.000 --> 01:58:52.000
So it is kind of interesting that we got Versus Excitebike instead.

01:58:52.000 --> 01:58:54.000
So let's fire it up and take a look at it.

01:58:54.000 --> 01:59:01.000
Now, I'm sure one of the things that people remember if you ever played Excitebike when it was released in the US is that you could create your own tracks.

01:59:01.000 --> 01:59:06.000
And there were options there for saving and loading, but they didn't really do anything.

01:59:06.000 --> 01:59:14.000
They didn't work because those options were obviously there for a Japanese release of the game that did allow you to save and load.

01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:20.000
And then, of course, Excitebike came out in the arcades later on as the Versus system was kind of more of a different upgraded game.

01:59:20.000 --> 01:59:24.000
You can see right here the copyright 1998. This was released later.

01:59:24.000 --> 01:59:27.000
And sure, there's an edit mode in here as well.

01:59:27.000 --> 01:59:32.000
And if we were to go into the edit mode, of course, we have to sit through loading screens now, which we weren't used to in the US.

01:59:32.000 --> 01:59:35.000
But we can actually go in and we can edit a particular track if we want.

01:59:35.000 --> 01:59:39.000
So let's say we want to edit, I don't know, we'll just edit track number four here.

01:59:39.000 --> 01:59:42.000
OK, so it's already loaded in the system there.

01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:46.000
If I want to, I think if I remember right, using the select button.

01:59:46.000 --> 01:59:49.000
Yeah, we just we just eliminate all of track four.

01:59:49.000 --> 01:59:51.000
Screw it. Yep, that's all we got.

01:59:51.000 --> 01:59:52.000
That was a finish.

01:59:52.000 --> 02:00:00.000
And if I want to make a track and instead of you'll notice in the original NES American release, it was A, B, C, D, E, F, G, like it shows you different letters.

02:00:00.000 --> 02:00:05.000
But this one actually shows you, you know, crappy little pictures of what you're about to put down.

02:00:05.000 --> 02:00:13.000
So if you're a big fan of these little flat hills like I am, maybe you just want to make a level that's filled with nothing but these little flat hills.

02:00:13.000 --> 02:00:16.000
And why not a couple of arrows?

02:00:16.000 --> 02:00:19.000
You know, we might have to cool down the tank a little bit.

02:00:19.000 --> 02:00:22.000
And oh, I don't know, we'll do the big flying ones.

02:00:22.000 --> 02:00:24.000
I love the flying ones.

02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:27.000
Oh, wait, we need we need a clear path here after the fly one.

02:00:27.000 --> 02:00:30.000
Let's do maybe we want to increase the number here.

02:00:30.000 --> 02:00:35.000
Let's do a nice big break for eight.

02:00:35.000 --> 02:00:40.000
It goes in only different powers there of two.

02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:44.000
Let's try that again.

02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:45.000
OK, good enough.

02:00:45.000 --> 02:00:48.000
I don't need to spend all day here looking at this track in that segment.

02:00:48.000 --> 02:00:50.000
But then you can actually run a test run.

02:00:50.000 --> 02:00:52.000
Right.

02:00:52.000 --> 02:00:54.000
And we can race the bike.

02:00:55.000 --> 02:00:58.000
Just like you would, you know, with my slow, my fast.

02:00:58.000 --> 02:01:00.000
Oh, yay, flat hills, my favorite.

02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:01.000
Let's go.

02:01:01.000 --> 02:01:02.000
I crashed.

02:01:02.000 --> 02:01:04.000
OK, maybe they're not my favorite anymore.

02:01:04.000 --> 02:01:05.000
All right, cool down.

02:01:05.000 --> 02:01:07.000
Then these are definitely my favorite.

02:01:07.000 --> 02:01:09.000
I almost broke the ceiling on that one.

02:01:09.000 --> 02:01:13.000
OK, I like that track because I almost hit the ceiling so I can actually let's see.

02:01:13.000 --> 02:01:16.000
I'm going to go back to the edit because if I hit continue, I'm just going to continue.

02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:21.000
But then I can actually save and I can now save my track four.

02:01:21.000 --> 02:01:23.000
So now track four is that.

02:01:23.000 --> 02:01:24.000
It's that track.

02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:25.000
So that's kind of neat.

02:01:25.000 --> 02:01:28.000
And then you can I think you can kind of like copy.

02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:35.000
You can kind of pull tracks down and save into other people's disks and so forth because they got this whole disk edit thing in there and so forth.

02:01:35.000 --> 02:01:46.000
But then I think it's also worth talking about the game itself because the game itself, when you get into the site bike on the release here from the Famicom version of the game,

02:01:46.000 --> 02:01:49.000
the disk system version of the game is that it's more like the arcade release.

02:01:49.000 --> 02:01:55.000
So if you ever played a site bike in the arcade, you are really playing versus excite bike, which was a little different.

02:01:55.000 --> 02:01:56.000
So let's actually go in and look here.

02:01:56.000 --> 02:02:00.000
So again, it's got a load because it's a disk game.

02:02:00.000 --> 02:02:05.000
When it comes up, you can choose my beginner, intermediate, advanced.

02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:08.000
I'm going to pick Bobby Black Wolf mode and stick with beginner here.

02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:10.000
And you get this whole, OK, it's interesting.

02:02:10.000 --> 02:02:12.000
You kind of see the different tracks twice.

02:02:12.000 --> 02:02:16.000
OK, so what happens is that first you're going to race it with nobody else.

02:02:16.000 --> 02:02:18.000
So it's like a practice.

02:02:18.000 --> 02:02:20.000
So let's do this.

02:02:20.000 --> 02:02:21.000
So here I go.

02:02:21.000 --> 02:02:22.000
I'm racing.

02:02:22.000 --> 02:02:23.000
And what's interesting.

02:02:23.000 --> 02:02:25.000
Well, for one, there's background music.

02:02:25.000 --> 02:02:27.000
There wasn't background music in the original site bike.

02:02:27.000 --> 02:02:30.000
Also, if I hit the fast button.

02:02:30.000 --> 02:02:34.000
So like, you know how one button was just like a normal engine, but the other was like a fast engine.

02:02:34.000 --> 02:02:38.000
You actually don't hear that higher pitch squeal.

02:02:38.000 --> 02:02:40.000
You'll notice you're not hearing it.

02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:43.000
You do notice my temperature gauge is going up a lot faster when I use it.

02:02:43.000 --> 02:02:47.000
In fact, let me let me hammer down on that button.

02:02:47.000 --> 02:02:52.000
There it is, because it's not until you get way too high that you'll hear that higher pitch.

02:02:52.000 --> 02:02:54.000
Let me do it again.

02:02:54.000 --> 02:02:57.000
OK, so it got a little right before I crossed the finish line there, got a little high pitch.

02:02:57.000 --> 02:02:59.000
You saw my character was flashing there as well.

02:02:59.000 --> 02:03:05.000
That's how you know that, you know, you're maybe lead footing on the heavy speed up gas a little too much.

02:03:05.000 --> 02:03:06.000
All right.

02:03:06.000 --> 02:03:07.000
So hurry.

02:03:07.000 --> 02:03:09.000
I qualified for the regular race.

02:03:09.000 --> 02:03:10.000
So now it's real excite bike.

02:03:10.000 --> 02:03:13.000
So we're going to be racing against other bikers.

02:03:13.000 --> 02:03:14.000
I'm going to come in number one.

02:03:14.000 --> 02:03:17.000
I got to get one minute and 18 seconds.

02:03:17.000 --> 02:03:18.000
So let's do it.

02:03:18.000 --> 02:03:19.000
We're going to race here.

02:03:19.000 --> 02:03:20.000
These are the bikers.

02:03:20.000 --> 02:03:21.000
I can do it.

02:03:21.000 --> 02:03:22.000
All right.

02:03:22.000 --> 02:03:23.000
Wow.

02:03:23.000 --> 02:03:24.000
They really took off.

02:03:24.000 --> 02:03:27.000
But the funny thing is these other bikers, it's not like when you're playing Mario Kart

02:03:27.000 --> 02:03:30.000
and you're racing like actually like Mario and Princess Peach and stuff.

02:03:30.000 --> 02:03:36.000
These bikers, they're just there to get your way, because what it really comes down to is your time.

02:03:36.000 --> 02:03:38.000
Nothing else matters, but your time.

02:03:38.000 --> 02:03:40.000
Although you can screw these other racers if you want.

02:03:40.000 --> 02:03:44.000
If you're able to kind of like change a lane right.

02:03:44.000 --> 02:03:45.000
There you go.

02:03:45.000 --> 02:03:49.000
See, see how I crashed that guy by changing a lane right on top of him.

02:03:49.000 --> 02:03:50.000
As long as you are in front of him.

02:03:50.000 --> 02:03:52.000
See, that one didn't work out so well.

02:03:52.000 --> 02:03:58.000
But as long as you're in front of him when you do it, then you crash him and it's really satisfying.

02:03:58.000 --> 02:03:59.000
So let's see.

02:03:59.000 --> 02:04:00.000
Oops, I'm overheating here.

02:04:00.000 --> 02:04:01.000
I'm going too fast.

02:04:01.000 --> 02:04:07.000
What I try to do, I usually go the normal and then like right before a hop, I'll hit the super accelerate.

02:04:07.000 --> 02:04:09.000
Oh, that didn't work out so well.

02:04:09.000 --> 02:04:12.000
I'm really out of practice on this, you guys.

02:04:12.000 --> 02:04:23.000
But hopefully, see, we really fly with the super heavy foot there.

02:04:23.000 --> 02:04:26.000
And almost to the end.

02:04:26.000 --> 02:04:31.000
Sadly, you can't run the people over as they're running to their bikes as amazingly satisfactory as that would be.

02:04:31.000 --> 02:04:32.000
But all right, we did it.

02:04:32.000 --> 02:04:36.000
And we got 107, which was enough for first place.

02:04:36.000 --> 02:04:37.000
And look at that.

02:04:37.000 --> 02:04:42.000
You even have like a winner's podium with five places, not three like you usually see in the Olympics and stuff, but whatever.

02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:44.000
So you have like a five person podium there.

02:04:44.000 --> 02:04:46.000
And congratulations.

02:04:46.000 --> 02:04:50.000
I got first place on track one and a really high pitched whale to go with it.

02:04:50.000 --> 02:04:52.000
Sorry about that, but it's the game's fault, not mine.

02:04:52.000 --> 02:04:56.000
So now we can go on to track number two and race that way.

02:04:56.000 --> 02:04:57.000
But there you go.

02:04:57.000 --> 02:05:04.000
I want to show you a look at versus excite bike and how it's a little bit different from the regular excite bike that many of you grew up with and were used to.

02:05:04.000 --> 02:05:10.000
Unless you had access to the Famicom Disk System or you played this a lot in the arcade, you might not have seen this before.

02:05:10.000 --> 02:05:18.000
So kind of a different release there on the Nintendo Entertainment System Classic Online Library or Nesflix.

02:05:18.000 --> 02:05:20.000
It's called Nesflix for short on the Nintendo Switch.

02:05:20.000 --> 02:05:26.000
Anyway, back to the studio live.

02:05:26.000 --> 02:05:27.000
All right.

02:05:27.000 --> 02:05:28.000
Thank you, me, for that segment.

02:05:28.000 --> 02:05:30.000
Appreciate that.

02:05:31.000 --> 02:05:34.000
Look there at excite bike versus so dark soccer.

02:05:34.000 --> 02:05:36.000
Did you ever play the versus excite bike?

02:05:36.000 --> 02:05:38.000
I know you're a big retro person back in the day.

02:05:38.000 --> 02:05:40.000
Yeah, I remember playing in the arcades.

02:05:40.000 --> 02:05:42.000
But, you know, I always kind of forgot.

02:05:42.000 --> 02:05:45.000
Oh, yeah. In Japan, they got like this whole version of that released over there.

02:05:45.000 --> 02:05:46.000
Yeah.

02:05:46.000 --> 02:05:52.000
Anyway, for our next little segment here, one of our favorite contributors here, orange on trade.

02:05:52.000 --> 02:05:58.000
You wanted to come onto the show tonight and actually talk to us about some things that are going on in his world.

02:05:58.000 --> 02:06:00.000
So we wanted to welcome him onto the show tonight.

02:06:00.000 --> 02:06:02.000
Hey, why are you there with us?

02:06:02.000 --> 02:06:04.000
I have my own world. Really?

02:06:04.000 --> 02:06:13.000
Yeah. Well, I guess are the worlds of bungee ferret tossing and a stacked snake 360.

02:06:13.000 --> 02:06:14.000
Why can't it falling?

02:06:14.000 --> 02:06:16.000
Are you suggesting a YY our cinematic universe?

02:06:16.000 --> 02:06:17.000
Yes.

02:06:17.000 --> 02:06:21.000
Is there a YY our.

02:06:21.000 --> 02:06:27.000
I haven't really thought into it that much, to be honest.

02:06:27.000 --> 02:06:34.000
Maybe someday, maybe maybe that's what we're slowly working towards is a game that combines all your other pre made game.

02:06:34.000 --> 02:06:40.000
See, I'm here to speak to you about the sneak 360 initiative.

02:06:40.000 --> 02:06:43.000
So what is on your mind tonight? What's new in your world?

02:06:43.000 --> 02:06:50.000
Well, I mean, this this whole time flies thing is absolutely ridiculous.

02:06:50.000 --> 02:06:54.000
I mean, here we are on episode 777 of the show.

02:06:54.000 --> 02:06:55.000
Right.

02:06:55.000 --> 02:06:56.000
Yeah.

02:06:56.000 --> 02:07:01.000
Yeah. Snake 360 came out in November of 2008.

02:07:01.000 --> 02:07:03.000
So it's been over 10 years now.

02:07:03.000 --> 02:07:06.000
So it's just and and let me tell you something.

02:07:06.000 --> 02:07:09.000
It's eligible for classic game of the week.

02:07:09.000 --> 02:07:10.000
Yes.

02:07:10.000 --> 02:07:11.000
Intent.

02:07:11.000 --> 02:07:13.000
Nudge, nudge, wink, wink.

02:07:13.000 --> 02:07:14.000
But let me tell you something else.

02:07:14.000 --> 02:07:17.000
You know how and you know what?

02:07:17.000 --> 02:07:20.000
I have a feeling Loki will agree with me on this.

02:07:21.000 --> 02:07:26.000
You know how every parent or so many parents say, well, they grow up so fast.

02:07:26.000 --> 02:07:28.000
I have an 11 month old now.

02:07:28.000 --> 02:07:30.000
You believe it?

02:07:30.000 --> 02:07:36.000
I know in just another month, you'll no longer be referring to it in months because it will be years.

02:07:36.000 --> 02:07:37.000
It's so interesting.

02:07:37.000 --> 02:07:41.000
Your own child is so close to, you know, my good pal, Melody.

02:07:41.000 --> 02:07:43.000
And she's married to Mel B.

02:07:43.000 --> 02:07:45.000
A lot of the DDR folks from Freestyle.

02:07:45.000 --> 02:07:47.000
They did not name their kid.

02:07:47.000 --> 02:07:50.000
No, they did not name their kid now, but they their baby.

02:07:50.000 --> 02:07:53.000
I just went to the first birthday party like, wow.

02:07:53.000 --> 02:07:54.000
Yeah.

02:07:54.000 --> 02:07:55.000
So they're not that far apart.

02:07:55.000 --> 02:07:56.000
I don't know.

02:07:56.000 --> 02:08:04.000
My one hundred and two month year old one hundred and two month old.

02:08:04.000 --> 02:08:05.000
That's very funny.

02:08:05.000 --> 02:08:10.000
But no, it's like I honestly believe you don't really see that until you have a child yourself.

02:08:10.000 --> 02:08:16.000
Just how quickly, you know, it's like already there are things she used to do that she doesn't do anymore.

02:08:16.000 --> 02:08:19.000
And then it's it's scary.

02:08:19.000 --> 02:08:22.000
Like she points at exit signs.

02:08:22.000 --> 02:08:24.000
She makes all kinds of babbles.

02:08:24.000 --> 02:08:26.000
She points at stop signs.

02:08:26.000 --> 02:08:29.000
She has strong preferences for certain things.

02:08:29.000 --> 02:08:31.000
Also, she's played a video game.

02:08:31.000 --> 02:08:35.000
I was going to say, well, my friend, I won't be having kids ever.

02:08:35.000 --> 02:08:38.000
So I'll live vicariously through the rest of you.

02:08:38.000 --> 02:08:40.000
You know what?

02:08:40.000 --> 02:08:48.000
I've talked to some people who are like, that's the best way, because it's like you get to hang out with your friends and, you know, other people who have kids.

02:08:48.000 --> 02:08:49.000
You get to hang out with them.

02:08:49.000 --> 02:08:50.000
You get to spoil them.

02:08:50.000 --> 02:08:55.000
You get to, you know, spend time with them and then you get to go home and it's somebody else's problem.

02:08:55.000 --> 02:08:59.000
For the record, I'm five hundred and seventeen months old right now.

02:08:59.000 --> 02:09:02.000
Happy birthday.

02:09:02.000 --> 02:09:03.000
Anyway, sorry.

02:09:03.000 --> 02:09:04.000
Yeah.

02:09:04.000 --> 02:09:05.000
Playing your first video game.

02:09:06.000 --> 02:09:09.000
So, actually, you know what?

02:09:09.000 --> 02:09:15.000
I'll just skip to this because I have a list, but I'm going to skip to announcing Sharpshooter Plus.

02:09:15.000 --> 02:09:27.000
This is the first video game that my daughter, Annie, has played because the previous version, it only allowed you to play with a game controller.

02:09:27.000 --> 02:09:37.000
And now the new version allows you to also play with your mouse or, if you have one connected, a touch screen.

02:09:37.000 --> 02:09:48.000
And by the way, I just posted a link in chat to a video of the previous version, so feel free to put that up or do whatever with it.

02:09:48.000 --> 02:09:55.000
Unlike Bobby, I can't do the YouTubes live because I don't have a dual monitor, so I'll just have to rely on the chatters to go look at that.

02:09:55.000 --> 02:09:56.000
We should fix that.

02:09:56.000 --> 02:10:00.000
That is a future OLR upgrade. It's on the list.

02:10:00.000 --> 02:10:08.000
But yeah, Sharpshooter is basically, and it was actually one of my most popular games on 360.

02:10:08.000 --> 02:10:12.000
It is a straight up hardcore skills test.

02:10:12.000 --> 02:10:23.000
It is just you and 20 target shooting mini games, and you just try to do as well as you can, try for the highest score, try for the best grade.

02:10:23.000 --> 02:10:29.000
The ultimate goal of the game is to play the master difficulty and to get the highest grade of AAA.

02:10:29.000 --> 02:10:32.000
And it is absolutely not easy.

02:10:32.000 --> 02:10:45.000
And if you've been, you know, playing slow paced RPGs or, you know, first person shooters and you've let those hardcore arcade gaming skills dull, you're going to have an uphill climb ahead of you.

02:10:45.000 --> 02:10:51.000
So Dartatia in chat says, so sort of like point blank, I would say this is more like police trainer.

02:10:51.000 --> 02:10:54.000
Hogan's Alley is the one that it kind of reminds me of.

02:10:54.000 --> 02:11:04.000
Well, I mean, police trainer, let's face it, police trainer was basically point blank with not as good graphics or more fun imagination.

02:11:04.000 --> 02:11:06.000
But I mean, I'll tell you this.

02:11:06.000 --> 02:11:12.000
Sharpshooter is basically my point blank, but it has even worse graphics than police trainer.

02:11:12.000 --> 02:11:16.000
That being said, it is a fun game.

02:11:16.000 --> 02:11:18.000
I wouldn't put it out if it wasn't.

02:11:18.000 --> 02:11:30.000
And I have spent a lot of time carefully tuning the difficulty and for the mouse and the touch screen input settings, the difficulty is tuned completely differently.

02:11:30.000 --> 02:11:34.000
So it is absolutely tailored to how you're playing it.

02:11:34.000 --> 02:11:39.000
And the difficulty also automatically adjusts as you're playing based on how you're doing.

02:11:39.000 --> 02:11:43.000
And the better you're doing, the more opportunities for score there are.

02:11:43.000 --> 02:11:49.000
So you're just going to want to hit everything, never miss, never fail if you want the highest score.

02:11:49.000 --> 02:11:56.000
Yeah, I'm actually I got to admit, I do remember when you put this game out on Xbox Live, but I kind of you know, I didn't get I'm going to be honest.

02:11:56.000 --> 02:12:01.000
I didn't get as into this one as some of your other releases because it was more controller.

02:12:01.000 --> 02:12:03.000
And that's kind of hard. That's a hard thing to emulate.

02:12:03.000 --> 02:12:08.000
So I think now that you got the mouse and keyboard as well as like the touch, that's that's a game changer.

02:12:08.000 --> 02:12:12.000
That's going to be like, OK, like now I'm imagining playing this with mouse and keyboard.

02:12:12.000 --> 02:12:15.000
I am watching the video that you brought up. Imagine playing this mouse and keyboard.

02:12:15.000 --> 02:12:18.000
I'm like, oh, this can be fun. And it's just mouse, by the way.

02:12:18.000 --> 02:12:22.000
You can put your keyboard away. Right. Of course.

02:12:22.000 --> 02:12:25.000
Because you just click to fire. You don't necessarily have to hit the spacebar.

02:12:25.000 --> 02:12:30.000
I don't know why. By default, I always say mouse and keyboard. But of course, yes, just your mouse.

02:12:30.000 --> 02:12:36.000
And let me tell you something, too, because if you play on touch screen, you would, of course, think, well,

02:12:36.000 --> 02:12:41.000
I mean, I don't have to aim and I can just tap the targets. That sounds really easy.

02:12:41.000 --> 02:12:47.000
Yeah, I thought of that. It is much more challenging when playing on touch screen.

02:12:47.000 --> 02:12:52.000
The quotas are way higher. Things move a lot faster. It is so much fun.

02:12:52.000 --> 02:12:58.000
I had a lot of fun implementing and playing and testing this thing.

02:12:58.000 --> 02:13:03.000
I am so excited to check this out, so I'm assuming your release platform is Steam loading itself to the mouse.

02:13:03.000 --> 02:13:07.000
It is. And you know what? I'm going to go ahead and say it.

02:13:07.000 --> 02:13:16.000
All future YYR Games releases on PC and Mac will be exclusive to Steam and will never be on the Epic Games Store.

02:13:16.000 --> 02:13:22.000
All right. I'm sure that news this week did them no favors in that regard.

02:13:22.000 --> 02:13:27.000
I know. I know. They're trembling in their boots right now, I would imagine.

02:13:27.000 --> 02:13:36.000
Hey, I'm still rooting for you to get the development on the you-know-what that's coming out in the, you know, near future 2020.

02:13:36.000 --> 02:13:44.000
And maybe people will care, you know, when they start discovering your brilliant games, because I still say super multitasking.

02:13:44.000 --> 02:13:52.000
Like the game is so flipping good. I don't know why it is not like a streamer's, like, go to it. It's so fun.

02:13:52.000 --> 02:14:00.000
Well, I am planning to try to put some more effort into promotion over the coming months, because honestly I haven't done much with it.

02:14:00.000 --> 02:14:03.000
Well, you've kind of had a baby.

02:14:03.000 --> 02:14:05.000
That, yeah.

02:14:05.000 --> 02:14:08.000
That'll get in the way, but in a good way.

02:14:08.000 --> 02:14:15.000
I definitely am planning to do more as far as promotion, and part of that is I'm going to put together some videos.

02:14:15.000 --> 02:14:24.000
And the first of it is going to be a series of retrospectives about what I've been up to over the last 10 years.

02:14:24.000 --> 02:14:29.000
I actually was recording footage for some of these over the weekend.

02:14:29.000 --> 02:14:35.000
Let me tell you something. I took out my Commodore that I've had for over 30 years now.

02:14:35.000 --> 02:14:42.000
And I loaded up Gary Kitchen's Game Maker, which was my favorite thing on the Commodore 64.

02:14:42.000 --> 02:14:48.000
This thing was genius. It was way ahead of its time. Published by Activision in 1985.

02:14:48.000 --> 02:14:56.000
This thing had a built-in programming language, and you picked the commands from a menu rather than having to remember them.

02:14:56.000 --> 02:15:05.000
It had a built-in sprite creator, sound maker, music maker, and it let you just kind of put everything all together.

02:15:05.000 --> 02:15:10.000
Let me tell you something. This thing was so much fun to use, but oh my god. I had no idea.

02:15:10.000 --> 02:15:15.000
I completely forgot about some of the absolute garbage that I created on that thing.

02:15:15.000 --> 02:15:21.000
And you will see some of the embarrassings when I release the video.

02:15:21.000 --> 02:15:25.000
It'll be right on the front page of yyrgames.com if you're interested.

02:15:25.000 --> 02:15:30.000
I can't wait. So you know the other question I have to ask, or I would be a terrible video game commentator.

02:15:30.000 --> 02:15:34.000
Do you have any idea what type of release window we're looking at for Sharpshooter Plus?

02:15:34.000 --> 02:15:41.000
Oh yeah, early summer. I was hoping to have it out by this month actually, but you know, real life.

02:15:41.000 --> 02:15:52.000
So probably either late June or early July. But that's not it. I have one more release planned for this summer.

02:15:52.000 --> 02:15:59.000
Oh, wow. I feel like we're at an E3 fucking press conference right now. This is great. That's not all.

02:15:59.000 --> 02:16:04.000
So I would love to announce Bungie Ferret Tossing 1.5.

02:16:04.000 --> 02:16:07.000
Yay, our fave!

02:16:07.000 --> 02:16:16.000
It is coming back. It's going to have improved graphics, and I mean that's a low bar because the first one didn't look all that great.

02:16:16.000 --> 02:16:26.000
But now this time I have Amy with me, and she is much more of an artist than I, and she's going to be coaching me through improving the graphics somewhat.

02:16:26.000 --> 02:16:35.000
So expect more animation and just things will look better. But I'm not going to stop at just the graphics.

02:16:35.000 --> 02:16:40.000
So who played Mars Matrix on either Arcade or Dreamcast?

02:16:40.000 --> 02:16:46.000
I have Mars Matrix on Dreamcast and have played a relatively okay amount of it.

02:16:46.000 --> 02:16:55.000
I figured you would answer that. You did. So do you remember that Mars Matrix on Dreamcast had an arrange mode,

02:16:55.000 --> 02:17:04.000
where basically you could, by playing the game, earn points and then spend them in an item shop to be able to unlock tweaks,

02:17:04.000 --> 02:17:11.000
and then you could just kind of adjust the game however you wanted. You could make the combo timer longer.

02:17:11.000 --> 02:17:16.000
You could increase the speed of everything. You could just make all kinds of different tweaks.

02:17:16.000 --> 02:17:23.000
Well, I'm ripping a page out of that book, and that is going to be one of the major new features of Bungie Ferret Tossing 1.5.

02:17:23.000 --> 02:17:35.000
I'm going to call it remix mode, and you are going to be able to adjust literally 18 different things from things that really affect the game,

02:17:35.000 --> 02:17:44.000
like what HP the enemies have and you have, to the speed of your helicopter, to absolutely ridiculous and silly things,

02:17:44.000 --> 02:17:49.000
like the amount of blood particles, the gravity.

02:17:49.000 --> 02:17:52.000
What about ferret shrieking?

02:17:52.000 --> 02:17:58.000
Well, actually, that was already adjustable. If you go to the options menu, you can adjust how frequently...

02:17:58.000 --> 02:18:01.000
I mean like different shrieks.

02:18:01.000 --> 02:18:06.000
Oh, well, I'll record some new shrieks just for you.

02:18:06.000 --> 02:18:11.000
I think it would be funny to like be able to choose like high pitched or rawr, you know.

02:18:11.000 --> 02:18:12.000
You know, I'm watching this video.

02:18:12.000 --> 02:18:13.000
Oh, pitch.

02:18:13.000 --> 02:18:19.000
I'm watching this video that you put in chat of hitstun getting like a high score in the game, and you know, I have to admit,

02:18:19.000 --> 02:18:23.000
it's been a little while since I've kind of, you know, because this was back on the 360.

02:18:23.000 --> 02:18:29.000
It's been a little while since I've really seen this, and I'm still just blown away that like this actually happened.

02:18:29.000 --> 02:18:31.000
Like, you know what I mean?

02:18:31.000 --> 02:18:34.000
Like, it's just so fun to watch. It's great.

02:18:34.000 --> 02:18:40.000
And it's a legitimate like bullet dodging, action packed experience.

02:18:40.000 --> 02:18:47.000
And so, this is also going to be the very first YYR Games title with DLC.

02:18:47.000 --> 02:18:49.000
Ooh.

02:18:49.000 --> 02:18:53.000
I mean, don't get too excited. I only really have two things.

02:18:54.000 --> 02:19:01.000
Which actually is created by the very same person I mentioned in chat earlier who works IT for Jersey Jack.

02:19:01.000 --> 02:19:08.000
So, it'll be really easy to get in touch with him and see if he has anything to share with you.

02:19:08.000 --> 02:19:16.000
But yeah, the soundtrack is great, and he's actually thinking of making a remixed soundtrack for this version.

02:19:16.000 --> 02:19:20.000
So, you know, it'll be great if you like the music.

02:19:20.000 --> 02:19:23.000
You'll be able to buy it probably for like one or two bucks.

02:19:23.000 --> 02:19:29.000
And then, also, for those people who either don't have time or are very lazy,

02:19:29.000 --> 02:19:34.000
I'm planning to have a DLC item called I'm Lazy, Here's a Dollar.

02:19:35.000 --> 02:19:38.000
And it will unlock everything for you.

02:19:41.000 --> 02:19:43.000
I'm lazy, here's a dollar.

02:19:43.000 --> 02:19:44.000
I approve.

02:19:44.000 --> 02:19:47.000
I like that you're just calling it what it is.

02:19:48.000 --> 02:19:56.000
And I mean, really, the remix options, I think it'll be for those people that are, you know,

02:19:56.000 --> 02:20:00.000
they don't have time or they just don't feel like it, yeah, they can pay a dollar.

02:20:00.000 --> 02:20:06.000
But for everybody else, I think it'll be a fun puzzle to figure out which options, you know,

02:20:06.000 --> 02:20:09.000
adjusting them which way will allow you to increase your score.

02:20:09.000 --> 02:20:15.000
Because one of the questions I got about the first one, because the score is measured in money because America.

02:20:15.000 --> 02:20:20.000
But so many people at conventions ask me, what will you do with the money?

02:20:20.000 --> 02:20:22.000
And I'm like, well, it's just your score.

02:20:22.000 --> 02:20:25.000
And they're like, oh, but now there's something you can do with the money.

02:20:25.000 --> 02:20:27.000
You can spend it on these unlocks.

02:20:28.000 --> 02:20:31.000
Or you can just be lazy and give you a dollar.

02:20:32.000 --> 02:20:34.000
Or you can just be lazy and give me a dollar.

02:20:34.000 --> 02:20:36.000
I won't turn it away.

02:20:37.000 --> 02:20:41.000
By the way, your DLC is getting a huge response in chat in a good way.

02:20:44.000 --> 02:20:45.000
Nice.

02:20:45.000 --> 02:20:46.000
I love it.

02:20:46.000 --> 02:20:49.000
Let's see. SheHulk10 is asking, though, on Xbox One, question mark?

02:20:49.000 --> 02:20:51.000
But this is all Steam, right?

02:20:52.000 --> 02:20:54.000
For the moment, it is all Steam.

02:20:54.000 --> 02:21:02.000
However, because of the Xbox One Creators Program and the fact that, you know, you don't need any concept approval,

02:21:02.000 --> 02:21:12.000
I am planning to bring Falling+, Sharp Shooter+, and Bungie Ferretossing 1.5 all to Xbox One,

02:21:12.000 --> 02:21:18.000
hopefully this year, for the same price and with the same features as the Steam releases,

02:21:18.000 --> 02:21:21.000
except for achievements, because we're not allowed to have those on Creators Program.

02:21:21.000 --> 02:21:23.000
Right. All right. Fair enough.

02:21:24.000 --> 02:21:25.000
I'm so excited.

02:21:25.000 --> 02:21:29.000
Yeah, I can't wait to experience these games again on PC.

02:21:29.000 --> 02:21:33.000
I'm so happy for you as an indie developer.

02:21:33.000 --> 02:21:36.000
I know these games are not bringing trucks full of money to your house.

02:21:36.000 --> 02:21:37.000
But you know what?

02:21:37.000 --> 02:21:40.000
I think the people that do discover them enjoy them,

02:21:40.000 --> 02:21:44.000
especially because, you know, you very much reasonably price these games.

02:21:44.000 --> 02:21:46.000
And I think they're a lot of fun.

02:21:46.000 --> 02:21:51.000
And obviously, I'm always going to be a little partial to you because you've been such a supporter of the show over the years.

02:21:52.000 --> 02:21:53.000
Well, what's not to support?

02:21:54.000 --> 02:21:55.000
It's a great show.

02:21:55.000 --> 02:21:57.000
I really appreciate that.

02:21:57.000 --> 02:21:59.000
And you do great stuff with your games.

02:21:59.000 --> 02:22:01.000
So, well, best of luck to you with these releases.

02:22:01.000 --> 02:22:08.000
Obviously, when we know the exact days, we'll be sure to relay that information here at OLR and let people know.

02:22:09.000 --> 02:22:11.000
But while we are, I am going to get back to the rest of the show.

02:22:11.000 --> 02:22:15.000
Is there anything else you want to part ways with here?

02:22:16.000 --> 02:22:21.000
Well, actually, I was thinking of sending an email, but I figured I'll just chime in on this.

02:22:21.000 --> 02:22:24.000
I may let you have your Drag Race time this week.

02:22:25.000 --> 02:22:34.000
About the loot box topic from last week's show, I feel like there's something that the platform holders could definitely do

02:22:34.000 --> 02:22:40.000
that wouldn't probably be all that difficult to implement and probably would make a big difference.

02:22:40.000 --> 02:22:44.000
If you go to the PlayStation Store, you know how they have like, well, this is a game.

02:22:44.000 --> 02:22:47.000
This is add-on content. This is demo. This is video.

02:22:48.000 --> 02:22:54.000
They could create a category called virtual currency or something like that.

02:22:54.000 --> 02:22:59.000
And it's like whenever you go and buy add-on content for a game, you get a warning.

02:22:59.000 --> 02:23:02.000
Yeah, so you need this game in order to use this.

02:23:02.000 --> 02:23:09.000
And if you own this game on PlayStation Plus and you lose access to it, you won't be able to use the add-on content anymore.

02:23:09.000 --> 02:23:12.000
They're very good about warning you about that.

02:23:12.000 --> 02:23:18.000
Why not warn people, okay, so you're about to buy virtual currency that can be spent on this game.

02:23:18.000 --> 02:23:22.000
It can only be used in this game. It is not worth money. There are no refunds.

02:23:22.000 --> 02:23:28.000
And you may be able to spend it on luck-based items.

02:23:29.000 --> 02:23:30.000
Why not that?

02:23:30.000 --> 02:23:35.000
Yeah, I like that idea of bringing more visibility to it right there in the store.

02:23:35.000 --> 02:23:39.000
I know you're kind of going a slightly different direction, but maybe just kind of calling out,

02:23:39.000 --> 02:23:42.000
this game has loot boxes. This game has currency in it.

02:23:42.000 --> 02:23:45.000
It's kind of like an extra step that the stores can do.

02:23:45.000 --> 02:23:51.000
Because again, I feel like if the developers aren't going to kind of regulate it, then the stores kind of have to do it.

02:23:51.000 --> 02:23:54.000
And if they don't do it, that's when the government's going to do it.

02:23:54.000 --> 02:23:57.000
And I don't think any of us trust the government to do it right.

02:23:58.000 --> 02:24:01.000
Those crotchy old people, I don't think so.

02:24:01.000 --> 02:24:02.000
Yeah. All right.

02:24:02.000 --> 02:24:06.000
Again, best of luck. It sounds like you're going to have a very busy summer.

02:24:06.000 --> 02:24:10.000
But I hope, above all else, I hope the baby has a wonderful first birthday.

02:24:10.000 --> 02:24:13.000
Oh, thank you so much. That means a lot.

02:24:13.000 --> 02:24:14.000
You're welcome.

02:24:14.000 --> 02:24:17.000
Yeah. Hey, keep doing what you're doing and have fun.

02:24:17.000 --> 02:24:20.000
All right. We'll try our best. Take care, my friend. It's always good to hear from you.

02:24:20.000 --> 02:24:22.000
All right. See you later.

02:24:22.000 --> 02:24:23.000
All right. See you.

02:24:23.000 --> 02:24:28.000
All right. YYR with some world exclusives. I feel like E3's already begun.

02:24:28.000 --> 02:24:31.000
I forgot to mention while he was on the phone.

02:24:31.000 --> 02:24:33.000
Oh, no. Well, he might still be in chat.

02:24:33.000 --> 02:24:36.000
I remember last week we were confused because he sent us an email about something,

02:24:36.000 --> 02:24:39.000
about a dream game idea that he was going to implement.

02:24:39.000 --> 02:24:42.000
And we were like, I don't remember what the hell that is.

02:24:42.000 --> 02:24:43.000
Yeah.

02:24:43.000 --> 02:24:45.000
I still don't know what the hell that is.

02:24:45.000 --> 02:24:47.000
Yeah, I forgot to ask him on the phone.

02:24:47.000 --> 02:24:51.000
I do recall something coming up about a Pixel Shits revision.

02:24:51.000 --> 02:24:52.000
Oh, okay.

02:24:52.000 --> 02:24:54.000
Of some sort, which he didn't address.

02:24:54.000 --> 02:24:59.000
But you know what, I'm sure YYR has a whole list of dream projects he's got to do.

02:24:59.000 --> 02:25:03.000
But I support these games getting a second life on Steam.

02:25:03.000 --> 02:25:07.000
So I'm all for more people discovering Sharpshooter.

02:25:07.000 --> 02:25:12.000
I mean, even myself, I kind of said like, the shooter on the 360 controller wasn't my favorite thing.

02:25:12.000 --> 02:25:14.000
Like, I still want to support what YYR is doing.

02:25:14.000 --> 02:25:16.000
But, you know, I prefer these other ones.

02:25:16.000 --> 02:25:21.000
But like to be able to do this on Steam, I think with the mouse, I'm going to super be into this.

02:25:21.000 --> 02:25:22.000
So I'm excited.

02:25:22.000 --> 02:25:25.000
I'll definitely stream the game whenever YYR will let me.

02:25:26.000 --> 02:25:31.000
So whether I get a sneak peek or if I have to wait for release like the rest of you, whatever happens.

02:25:31.000 --> 02:25:33.000
We'll do a stream at some point.

02:25:33.000 --> 02:25:37.000
Okay, well, anyhow, let's move on.

02:25:37.000 --> 02:25:39.000
We have more news to get to.

02:25:39.000 --> 02:25:40.000
Rapid fire news, actually.

02:25:40.000 --> 02:25:44.000
Travel around the world and check out some quick news stories going on.

02:25:44.000 --> 02:25:45.000
Who's starting us? Loki?

02:25:45.000 --> 02:25:47.000
That would be me.

02:25:47.000 --> 02:25:50.000
So Steam Link is finally coming to iOS.

02:25:50.000 --> 02:25:53.000
So it's been available on Android devices for a while now.

02:25:53.000 --> 02:25:57.000
And now it's available on iPhone, iPad, and Apple TV.

02:25:57.000 --> 02:26:03.000
So you can actually stream your Steam library to those Apple devices.

02:26:03.000 --> 02:26:08.000
There's a way to game more on other Apple devices.

02:26:08.000 --> 02:26:10.000
So cool.

02:26:10.000 --> 02:26:11.000
So go check that out.

02:26:11.000 --> 02:26:12.000
It's free.

02:26:12.000 --> 02:26:14.000
I still have yet to use mine.

02:26:14.000 --> 02:26:16.000
And I even have a Steam Link.

02:26:16.000 --> 02:26:19.000
But I haven't gotten a chance to use it.

02:26:19.000 --> 02:26:21.000
So, oh well.

02:26:21.000 --> 02:26:22.000
Someday.

02:26:22.000 --> 02:26:23.000
Someday I'll use it.

02:26:23.000 --> 02:26:30.000
And then finally, I guess we got some more news about the Mortal Kombat reboot.

02:26:30.000 --> 02:26:31.000
The movie, that is.

02:26:31.000 --> 02:26:36.000
So it was announced a while ago that it was going to be rebooted.

02:26:36.000 --> 02:26:45.000
And apparently there is some more, I guess, social media tweets and stuff about it.

02:26:45.000 --> 02:26:49.000
So I guess we're going to be seeing it sometime soon.

02:26:49.000 --> 02:26:56.000
Basically that, you know, I guess it's coming from Greg Russo.

02:26:56.000 --> 02:27:01.000
He says, if anyone has any concerns, if our director, Simon McQuid, will stay faithful to Mortal Kombat,

02:27:01.000 --> 02:27:06.000
I urge you to go back and look at some of the video game commercials he directed.

02:27:06.000 --> 02:27:11.000
His PS3 Michael spot still gets me every time I watch it.

02:27:11.000 --> 02:27:15.000
And that was the one, I remember that commercial.

02:27:15.000 --> 02:27:19.000
That was the one for the PlayStation where they're all kind of like, you know, this is for Michael.

02:27:19.000 --> 02:27:20.000
It's all the PlayStation characters and stuff.

02:27:20.000 --> 02:27:22.000
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. I remember that.

02:27:22.000 --> 02:27:24.000
Oh yeah, that was a pretty...

02:27:24.000 --> 02:27:28.000
Basically letting you know that, hey, you know, he is a big fan of video games.

02:27:28.000 --> 02:27:35.000
So, I mean, that's better than, hey, let's take Sonic the Hedgehog and make that into a movie.

02:27:35.000 --> 02:27:37.000
Because Smurfs did good.

02:27:37.000 --> 02:27:38.000
All right.

02:27:38.000 --> 02:27:39.000
And Chipmunks did good.

02:27:39.000 --> 02:27:40.000
Moving on.

02:27:40.000 --> 02:27:43.000
Speaking of movies and things that became video games, how about Ghostbusters?

02:27:43.000 --> 02:27:46.000
You know, there was a Ghostbusters video game in 2009.

02:27:46.000 --> 02:27:49.000
It was terrible and it was a reskin of another Japanese game.

02:27:49.000 --> 02:27:52.000
I was partial to Ghostbusters from like the 80s.

02:27:52.000 --> 02:27:53.000
The 2009 one?

02:27:53.000 --> 02:27:56.000
No, not 2009, sorry. I'm talking about like the old arcade one.

02:27:56.000 --> 02:27:57.000
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:27:57.000 --> 02:27:58.000
Oh, the arcade one.

02:27:58.000 --> 02:28:01.000
Yeah, I'm sorry. The one in 2009 was good. I was just thinking of the old one.

02:28:01.000 --> 02:28:03.000
Yeah, the 2009 one's basically Ghostbusters 3.

02:28:03.000 --> 02:28:07.000
Because it was all the original cast lending their voice and stuff.

02:28:07.000 --> 02:28:12.000
Yeah, and I'm thinking of the classic Activision game from the 80s.

02:28:12.000 --> 02:28:15.000
So I think what you're thinking of was arcade.

02:28:15.000 --> 02:28:18.000
Yeah, it was an arcade game and it was a reskin of a different game.

02:28:18.000 --> 02:28:20.000
Got it. Okay, that's not what this is.

02:28:20.000 --> 02:28:24.000
But anyway, that game, the Ghostbusters 3, that game,

02:28:24.000 --> 02:28:27.000
you know, you haven't been able to buy that on Steam since 2017.

02:28:27.000 --> 02:28:29.000
And people just kind of assumed, oh, licensing ran out.

02:28:29.000 --> 02:28:31.000
Something happened there with that movie.

02:28:31.000 --> 02:28:33.000
Maybe because of the new movie.

02:28:33.000 --> 02:28:34.000
Never just thought about it.

02:28:34.000 --> 02:28:37.000
I know. I didn't really give it a lot of thought either because the game was kind of old, right?

02:28:37.000 --> 02:28:41.000
Apparently, the Taiwanese game software rating website

02:28:41.000 --> 02:28:45.000
has shown that this game might be getting a remaster because there's a new listing up.

02:28:45.000 --> 02:28:48.000
Ghostbusters, the video game remastered.

02:28:48.000 --> 02:28:52.000
Mad Dog Games is the publisher who did things like World War Z and NBA playgrounds.

02:28:52.000 --> 02:28:58.000
Obviously, there's no release date, but this does show that this is being planned anyway for Xbox One.

02:28:58.000 --> 02:29:03.000
So it would probably be safe to assume that most of the, especially considering the age of the game,

02:29:03.000 --> 02:29:07.000
probably most, at least PlayStation 4, Xbox One, probably PC are going to be your big platforms.

02:29:07.000 --> 02:29:11.000
Switch, maybe, maybe not, just depending on how intense the remaster is.

02:29:11.000 --> 02:29:16.000
Can't imagine it's at the level where you won't even run on the Switch.

02:29:16.000 --> 02:29:17.000
So be curious to see, though.

02:29:17.000 --> 02:29:21.000
We'll wait for something official, but that'll be great for fans of Ghostbusters.

02:29:23.000 --> 02:29:28.000
Also, we mentioned earlier in the show that Team Sonic Racing is coming out this week.

02:29:28.000 --> 02:29:31.000
I guess I was the only one here in studio kind of interested in that one.

02:29:31.000 --> 02:29:32.000
I mean, it looks okay.

02:29:32.000 --> 02:29:34.000
I wasn't as excited as the first.

02:29:34.000 --> 02:29:37.000
I think a lot of the stuff that came out later on, the DLC, was kind of exciting.

02:29:37.000 --> 02:29:42.000
Like, you know, like the whole Shenmue and driving the Outrun arcade.

02:29:42.000 --> 02:29:45.000
I get it. Like, you know, all the characters and the other one kind of made it.

02:29:45.000 --> 02:29:48.000
They should have Mario as a DLC character.

02:29:48.000 --> 02:29:50.000
Well, guess what? There's going to be no DLC.

02:29:50.000 --> 02:29:51.000
That's the big news.

02:29:51.000 --> 02:29:52.000
Oh, lame.

02:29:52.000 --> 02:29:53.000
There's no DLC for Team Sonic Racing.

02:29:53.000 --> 02:29:58.000
And yeah, so they say that they could take content and sell it as DLC.

02:29:58.000 --> 02:30:01.000
This is Sega's Aaron Weber in a statement saying,

02:30:01.000 --> 02:30:06.000
this is just all the content that's going to be in the game is right there at launch.

02:30:06.000 --> 02:30:09.000
We're not going to charge you three bucks later for characters that were cut out of the game.

02:30:09.000 --> 02:30:12.000
It's all there, and you'll unlock everything as you go through.

02:30:12.000 --> 02:30:13.000
So there it is.

02:30:13.000 --> 02:30:16.000
This is no DLC because everything they want to do is just going to be up front.

02:30:16.000 --> 02:30:18.000
Kind of hard to complain about that.

02:30:18.000 --> 02:30:19.000
How games were.

02:30:19.000 --> 02:30:20.000
Yeah, I know.

02:30:20.000 --> 02:30:21.000
That's how the games used to be, right?

02:30:21.000 --> 02:30:22.000
Yep.

02:30:22.000 --> 02:30:24.000
Anyway, let's move on to Dark Sakura.

02:30:24.000 --> 02:30:25.000
Whale.

02:30:25.000 --> 02:30:27.000
You know, there's two things that I like.

02:30:27.000 --> 02:30:29.000
Soulcalibur and cats.

02:30:29.000 --> 02:30:30.000
What do they have in common?

02:30:30.000 --> 02:30:33.000
You can fight a game with a cat on your head now.

02:30:33.000 --> 02:30:39.000
Basically, there is a bunch of cosmetic DLC that has been put out for Soulcalibur 6.

02:30:39.000 --> 02:30:44.000
And you get a bunch of pretty clothes and tuxedoses and stuff.

02:30:44.000 --> 02:30:45.000
And cats.

02:30:45.000 --> 02:30:47.000
Cat hats.

02:30:47.000 --> 02:30:49.000
That's all cat hats.

02:30:49.000 --> 02:30:51.000
Not the cat in the hat, but the cat is a hat.

02:30:51.000 --> 02:30:52.000
And on your shoulder.

02:30:52.000 --> 02:30:54.000
So cat shoulder pauldrons or whatever.

02:30:54.000 --> 02:31:04.000
And on top of that, it's 150 different customization items and 97 music tracks from the previous series.

02:31:04.000 --> 02:31:06.000
But, number one, cats.

02:31:06.000 --> 02:31:08.000
Really, it's all cats.

02:31:08.000 --> 02:31:16.000
And number two, speaking of some Bandai Namco stuff.

02:31:16.000 --> 02:31:23.000
Harada Katsuhiro, who is the tech and producer, is now general manager at Bandai Namco.

02:31:23.000 --> 02:31:26.000
So that puts him in charge.

02:31:26.000 --> 02:31:30.000
Of course, still Tekken, but Ace Combat, Soulcalibur, Dark Souls, a bunch of others.

02:31:30.000 --> 02:31:32.000
Some of their sports titles.

02:31:32.000 --> 02:31:33.000
So, yeah.

02:31:33.000 --> 02:31:35.000
No vacay for him, huh?

02:31:35.000 --> 02:31:42.000
And then, as far as Tekken, Michael Murray will be helming the series going forward.

02:31:42.000 --> 02:31:45.000
He was with the franchise for Tekken 4.

02:31:45.000 --> 02:31:48.000
And now he's going to be producing the future sequels.

02:31:48.000 --> 02:31:49.000
Zzzz.

02:31:49.000 --> 02:31:50.000
Stago.

02:31:50.000 --> 02:31:51.000
All right.

02:31:51.000 --> 02:31:54.000
You know, I thought I heard kind of a similar note.

02:31:54.000 --> 02:31:58.000
I thought I kind of heard like an update on Tekken Cross Street Fighter.

02:31:58.000 --> 02:32:01.000
And the update is basically, we're not sure it can happen.

02:32:01.000 --> 02:32:03.000
And it was kind of a downer.

02:32:03.000 --> 02:32:04.000
Too late.

02:32:04.000 --> 02:32:06.000
The word is whatever.

02:32:06.000 --> 02:32:07.000
Yeah.

02:32:07.000 --> 02:32:09.000
I would have still liked it, but whatever.

02:32:09.000 --> 02:32:12.000
You got Akuma and Tekken 7.

02:32:12.000 --> 02:32:13.000
Take it or leave it.

02:32:13.000 --> 02:32:14.000
Be happy with what you get.

02:32:14.000 --> 02:32:15.000
That's right.

02:32:15.000 --> 02:32:16.000
All right.

02:32:16.000 --> 02:32:19.000
Let's move on and travel around the world and check out some release dates.

02:32:19.000 --> 02:32:21.000
Two weeks of release dates now.

02:32:21.000 --> 02:32:24.000
Well, we read them last week when you weren't here, just so you know.

02:32:24.000 --> 02:32:25.000
What?

02:32:25.000 --> 02:32:26.000
Yeah.

02:32:26.000 --> 02:32:27.000
When you weren't here.

02:32:27.000 --> 02:32:28.000
But I mean, no, no.

02:32:28.000 --> 02:32:30.000
I mean this week and next week.

02:32:30.000 --> 02:32:31.000
Oh, hello.

02:32:31.000 --> 02:32:32.000
Right.

02:32:32.000 --> 02:32:33.000
Because we're not here next week.

02:32:33.000 --> 02:32:34.000
Yes.

02:32:34.000 --> 02:32:35.000
I mean, I understood what you were saying.

02:32:35.000 --> 02:32:36.000
No, I'm okay.

02:32:36.000 --> 02:32:37.000
I'm a little slow.

02:32:37.000 --> 02:32:38.000
You don't have to call it out.

02:32:38.000 --> 02:32:40.000
What'd you get for all those Oreos, Rob?

02:32:40.000 --> 02:32:44.000
Don't be calling out to all the listeners and everybody what I'm doing during the break

02:32:44.000 --> 02:32:45.000
on the show.

02:32:45.000 --> 02:32:46.000
I wasn't talking about the break.

02:32:46.000 --> 02:32:48.000
I'm talking about all the Oreos.

02:32:48.000 --> 02:32:49.000
All of them.

02:32:49.000 --> 02:32:50.000
All of them.

02:32:50.000 --> 02:32:51.000
All right.

02:32:51.000 --> 02:32:52.000
Anyway.

02:32:52.000 --> 02:32:54.000
I'm actually going to be stopping for mint Oreos on the way home.

02:32:54.000 --> 02:32:55.000
Let's check out some release dates.

02:32:55.000 --> 02:32:56.000
I guess.

02:32:56.000 --> 02:32:57.000
Sure.

02:32:57.000 --> 02:32:58.000
For the next two weeks, if you want.

02:32:58.000 --> 02:32:59.000
Sure.

02:32:59.000 --> 02:33:00.000
Let's do it.

02:33:00.000 --> 02:33:01.000
Make sure we know what's what week.

02:33:01.000 --> 02:33:07.000
So for this coming week, we've got Assassin's Creed 3 remastered on Nintendo Switch.

02:33:07.000 --> 02:33:10.000
Atelier Leluna, the Scion of Arland.

02:33:10.000 --> 02:33:14.000
That's going to be on PC, Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4.

02:33:14.000 --> 02:33:18.000
Dauntless on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

02:33:18.000 --> 02:33:21.000
Observation on PC and PlayStation 4.

02:33:21.000 --> 02:33:25.000
Resident Evil 4, Resident Evil, Resident Evil 0.

02:33:25.000 --> 02:33:26.000
All on Nintendo Switch.

02:33:26.000 --> 02:33:33.000
Team Sonic Racing on PC, the Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

02:33:33.000 --> 02:33:37.000
Total War, Three Kingdoms on PC.

02:33:37.000 --> 02:33:42.000
And then the following week, we have Little Friends, Dogs and Cats on Nintendo Switch.

02:33:42.000 --> 02:33:45.000
That's as close as you're going to get to Nintendogs on the Switch.

02:33:45.000 --> 02:33:46.000
So there you go.

02:33:46.000 --> 02:33:52.000
Among the Sleep Enhanced Edition on the Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

02:33:52.000 --> 02:33:55.000
Blood and Truth on PlayStation 4.

02:33:55.000 --> 02:33:58.000
Oxygen Not Included on PC, Mac and Linux.

02:33:58.000 --> 02:34:00.000
That one looked interesting.

02:34:00.000 --> 02:34:02.000
I thought I saw a trailer for that one.

02:34:02.000 --> 02:34:05.000
It reminded me of like Portal almost.

02:34:05.000 --> 02:34:11.000
And then Cricket 19 on the Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

02:34:11.000 --> 02:34:17.000
And Pixarc on PC, Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

02:34:17.000 --> 02:34:19.000
That gets us into June.

02:34:19.000 --> 02:34:21.000
So stay tuned for June.

02:34:21.000 --> 02:34:22.000
Stay tuned for June.

02:34:22.000 --> 02:34:26.000
Meanwhile, we'll travel to Japan and check out some of the releases coming out there.

02:34:26.000 --> 02:34:31.000
On May 23rd, Assassin's Creed 3 Remastered is out on the PlayStation 4.

02:34:31.000 --> 02:34:34.000
Also a new headset if you're into peripherals.

02:34:34.000 --> 02:34:36.000
An official headset there on May 23rd.

02:34:36.000 --> 02:34:38.000
Otherwise, it's a pretty quiet week on the 23rd.

02:34:38.000 --> 02:34:41.000
As we move into May 30th, we have a couple other new games.

02:34:41.000 --> 02:34:45.000
Blood and Truth as well as that VA11 Hall A.

02:34:45.000 --> 02:34:48.000
That Valhalla, that kind of like hacker game.

02:34:48.000 --> 02:34:53.000
It actually gets a physical release in Japan as well on the 30th of May.

02:34:53.000 --> 02:34:54.000
So that's pretty cool.

02:34:54.000 --> 02:34:56.000
And that again is with a game called Blood and Truth.

02:34:56.000 --> 02:34:59.000
And that's pretty much what your May looks like on the PlayStation 4 in Japan.

02:34:59.000 --> 02:35:02.000
I'm trying to peek ahead here at the Nintendo Switch.

02:35:02.000 --> 02:35:04.000
Nintendo Switch has some other stuff.

02:35:04.000 --> 02:35:06.000
A lot of, again, peripherals.

02:35:06.000 --> 02:35:09.000
But that Assassin's Creed 3 remaster is also on the Switch.

02:35:09.000 --> 02:35:11.000
As is Biohazard Origins Collection.

02:35:11.000 --> 02:35:13.000
Of course, that's Resident Evil in Japan.

02:35:13.000 --> 02:35:18.000
And then a game called Shiritsu Berubara Gakuen comes out on...

02:35:18.000 --> 02:35:19.000
What?

02:35:20.000 --> 02:35:21.000
Is that a big game?

02:35:21.000 --> 02:35:22.000
Shiri... Shiri...

02:35:22.000 --> 02:35:24.000
Well, you remember the other ones?

02:35:24.000 --> 02:35:26.000
There's Shiritsu Justice Gakuen.

02:35:26.000 --> 02:35:28.000
Shiri... Is it Arrival Schools?

02:35:29.000 --> 02:35:31.000
It doesn't look like Arrival Schools.

02:35:31.000 --> 02:35:32.000
It looks like a school-based game.

02:35:32.000 --> 02:35:34.000
But it looks like, again, like a story.

02:35:34.000 --> 02:35:37.000
It's like the moment that you said that I instantly thought of Arrival Schools because it was...

02:35:37.000 --> 02:35:39.000
No. And it's not Capcom anyway. It's Idea Factory.

02:35:39.000 --> 02:35:40.000
Okay. Well, whatever.

02:35:40.000 --> 02:35:41.000
That should be enough right there.

02:35:41.000 --> 02:35:42.000
Sorry to get you excited.

02:35:42.000 --> 02:35:43.000
Don't care.

02:35:45.000 --> 02:35:48.000
And then let me peek ahead at the 30th on the Switch.

02:35:48.000 --> 02:35:52.000
A game called To All of Mankind is out on the Switch that week.

02:35:52.000 --> 02:35:59.000
As well as, again, that VA11 Hall A Valhalla is also out on the Switch in Japan that week.

02:35:59.000 --> 02:36:01.000
And that is pretty much your releases for Japan.

02:36:01.000 --> 02:36:03.000
So how about the UK, Dark Sakura?

02:36:03.000 --> 02:36:04.000
We have some.

02:36:04.000 --> 02:36:12.000
We have, on the 20th, we've got Killing Floor Double Feature, Team Sonic Racing, Assassin's Creed 3 Remastered.

02:36:12.000 --> 02:36:15.000
On the 21st, everybody's Golf VR.

02:36:15.000 --> 02:36:23.000
22nd, Total War Three Kingdoms Limited Edition, TT Isle of Man, Ride on the Edge.

02:36:23.000 --> 02:36:31.000
On the 23rd, Atelier Lula, The Scion of Arland, Dollhouse for the King.

02:36:31.000 --> 02:36:34.000
On the 27th, Cricket 19.

02:36:34.000 --> 02:36:38.000
Also on the 27th, Little Friends, Dogs and Cats.

02:36:40.000 --> 02:36:44.000
Spellforce 3, Soul Harvest Limited Edition.

02:36:44.000 --> 02:36:49.000
On the 28th, we have Among the Sleep Enhanced Edition, Blood and Truth.

02:36:49.000 --> 02:36:55.000
And on the 30th, we have Fun Fun Animal Park and Home Sweet Home.

02:36:55.000 --> 02:36:59.000
And Koutodama, The Seven Mysteries of Fujisawa.

02:36:59.000 --> 02:37:04.000
And Trover Saves the Universe and Pixar. That's it.

02:37:05.000 --> 02:37:10.000
Alright. Well, we'll be back in two weeks with more release dates.

02:37:10.000 --> 02:37:15.000
And I imagine as summer E3 comes up, we're probably going to have some surprise summer releases.

02:37:15.000 --> 02:37:16.000
So that'll be fun.

02:37:16.000 --> 02:37:20.000
We always know E3 is a good time for the whole, and it's out today, sorts of news.

02:37:20.000 --> 02:37:22.000
So, now let's go to our mailbag.

02:37:22.000 --> 02:37:26.000
Every week you guys send us emails to participate at orangelauntrader.com.

02:37:27.000 --> 02:37:29.000
And we read some of our favorites on the air.

02:37:29.000 --> 02:37:31.000
I think we have a couple emails tonight.

02:37:31.000 --> 02:37:32.000
We have three.

02:37:32.000 --> 02:37:37.000
So we didn't need YYR to save us from a Drag Race chat, but I'm glad YYR called in nonetheless.

02:37:37.000 --> 02:37:40.000
Well, I do still want FUs later, but...

02:37:40.000 --> 02:37:43.000
So, first one comes from Robert M.

02:37:43.000 --> 02:37:47.000
Rob, on the variety of Pokemon in Detective Pikachu, a lot of Pokemon got cut.

02:37:47.000 --> 02:37:48.000
This was a quote from you.

02:37:48.000 --> 02:37:52.000
Me to myself, how many of that HM do they have anyway?

02:37:52.000 --> 02:37:54.000
I get the joke.

02:37:54.000 --> 02:37:56.000
It gets cut as a move.

02:37:56.000 --> 02:37:57.000
Forget it.

02:37:57.000 --> 02:38:01.000
I haven't been able to find the Labo VR expansion kits yet, even on Amazon.

02:38:01.000 --> 02:38:08.000
Any idea if this is a Nintendo Shop at Home exclusive, or I'll be able to find them retail sooner rather than later?

02:38:08.000 --> 02:38:09.000
Labo what?

02:38:09.000 --> 02:38:10.000
Labo VR?

02:38:10.000 --> 02:38:11.000
Yeah, I haven't seen them in stores anywhere.

02:38:11.000 --> 02:38:13.000
They've been sold out.

02:38:13.000 --> 02:38:17.000
So this is just an LOL Nintendo and peripherals never stay in stock.

02:38:17.000 --> 02:38:19.000
It's kind of boring though.

02:38:19.000 --> 02:38:23.000
Like, I have them built in my house and we haven't touched them at all.

02:38:23.000 --> 02:38:30.000
The robot kit that was marked down to $39 this weekend, but I gotta be honest, I built it, I played it for a little bit.

02:38:30.000 --> 02:38:32.000
I'm probably not going to touch it again.

02:38:32.000 --> 02:38:34.000
And I heard the VR Zelda thing was not good.

02:38:34.000 --> 02:38:36.000
It's... no.

02:38:36.000 --> 02:38:39.000
And the VR Mario thing is kind of...

02:38:39.000 --> 02:38:43.000
I'm not going to... to be honest, I had fun building them.

02:38:43.000 --> 02:38:45.000
I'm not going to buy anymore.

02:38:45.000 --> 02:38:50.000
Because it's a bunch... like I thought it was going to be, it's a bunch of garbage that I built.

02:38:50.000 --> 02:38:52.000
But what about the Nintendo Labo Bacon Griller?

02:38:53.000 --> 02:38:56.000
Until it can grill bacon, I...

02:38:56.000 --> 02:39:00.000
Listen, I have a bunch of bacon in my fridge.

02:39:00.000 --> 02:39:02.000
It ain't grilling any of it.

02:39:02.000 --> 02:39:05.000
So, you know, that's unfortunately of no use to me.

02:39:05.000 --> 02:39:07.000
That's my worry.

02:39:07.000 --> 02:39:10.000
It's just that it's going to be a thing that you build and takes up a ton of space.

02:39:10.000 --> 02:39:15.000
And yeah, I know there's extra pieces that they're like, look, she doesn't take up that much space.

02:39:15.000 --> 02:39:17.000
But it still takes up a lot of space.

02:39:17.000 --> 02:39:19.000
And I have no place to put this stuff.

02:39:19.000 --> 02:39:21.000
And right now it's just sitting on my kitchen table.

02:39:21.000 --> 02:39:23.000
Among the pile of other stuff.

02:39:23.000 --> 02:39:25.000
So...

02:39:25.000 --> 02:39:27.000
Yeah, my kids aren't interested in playing it.

02:39:27.000 --> 02:39:29.000
I thought that they would be all gung ho.

02:39:29.000 --> 02:39:31.000
Oh, let's play the VR games.

02:39:31.000 --> 02:39:33.000
No, they really moved on to just...

02:39:33.000 --> 02:39:35.000
Anything else.

02:39:35.000 --> 02:39:37.000
Alright.

02:39:39.000 --> 02:39:41.000
So next meal.

02:39:41.000 --> 02:39:42.000
Yes.

02:39:42.000 --> 02:39:43.000
Alright.

02:39:43.000 --> 02:39:45.000
Hey, O-L-R, Frodo Swagins here.

02:39:45.000 --> 02:39:47.000
I remember a few months back, Rob and Bob,

02:39:47.000 --> 02:39:50.000
were messing around with one of the updates on No Man's Sky.

02:39:50.000 --> 02:39:53.000
I was wondering if you've heard anything about

02:39:53.000 --> 02:39:56.000
the Beyond update that is supposed to release this...

02:39:56.000 --> 02:39:57.000
Grammar.

02:39:57.000 --> 02:39:59.000
Supposed to release this summer.

02:39:59.000 --> 02:40:02.000
I guess it's a massive three-part update.

02:40:02.000 --> 02:40:05.000
I just read on the website that they will announce No Man's Sky Online.

02:40:05.000 --> 02:40:07.000
The paragraph stated the following, quote,

02:40:07.000 --> 02:40:11.000
No Man's Sky Online includes a radical new social multiplayer experience

02:40:11.000 --> 02:40:14.000
which empowers players everywhere in the universe

02:40:14.000 --> 02:40:16.000
to meet and play together.

02:40:16.000 --> 02:40:19.000
Whilst this brings people together like never before,

02:40:19.000 --> 02:40:22.000
it has many recognizable online elements,

02:40:22.000 --> 02:40:25.000
we don't consider No Man's Sky to be an MMO.

02:40:25.000 --> 02:40:27.000
It won't require a subscription,

02:40:27.000 --> 02:40:29.000
won't contain microtransactions,

02:40:29.000 --> 02:40:30.000
wince, wince, wince,

02:40:30.000 --> 02:40:33.000
and will be free for all existing players, end quote.

02:40:33.000 --> 02:40:35.000
I've never given this game a chance

02:40:35.000 --> 02:40:39.000
because there just didn't seem to be enough there for me

02:40:39.000 --> 02:40:41.000
to want to invest any time in.

02:40:41.000 --> 02:40:44.000
But I'm wondering if this update may potentially get me into the game.

02:40:44.000 --> 02:40:45.000
Any thoughts?

02:40:45.000 --> 02:40:47.000
You know, that game really has,

02:40:47.000 --> 02:40:49.000
and I don't know anything that you don't already know.

02:40:49.000 --> 02:40:51.000
I mean, we just know kind of what's out there officially.

02:40:51.000 --> 02:40:54.000
I don't know if we'll get more insight at E3 or what.

02:40:54.000 --> 02:40:56.000
Probably not, because I guess, you know,

02:40:56.000 --> 02:40:58.000
I don't think there'll be a lot of focus on the game,

02:40:58.000 --> 02:41:00.000
but it sure is really neat how much support,

02:41:00.000 --> 02:41:02.000
especially when you consider, like,

02:41:02.000 --> 02:41:05.000
how much the internet really shat on that game when it came out

02:41:05.000 --> 02:41:08.000
because, you know, they felt that the creators

02:41:08.000 --> 02:41:11.000
and Sony and its marketing had over-promised and under-delivered,

02:41:11.000 --> 02:41:13.000
which, you know, at this point is neither here nor there

02:41:13.000 --> 02:41:16.000
because they've really, you know, hit the pavement hard

02:41:16.000 --> 02:41:18.000
over the past, you know, couple of years

02:41:18.000 --> 02:41:21.000
and tried to make that game more into what that original vision is.

02:41:21.000 --> 02:41:24.000
So I think the fact that they are continuing to support it

02:41:24.000 --> 02:41:26.000
in the way that they are,

02:41:26.000 --> 02:41:29.000
and they are creating these free updates and things of that nature,

02:41:29.000 --> 02:41:31.000
I think it's a goddamn miracle, quite honestly,

02:41:31.000 --> 02:41:35.000
because EA would have pulled the online services by now.

02:41:35.000 --> 02:41:36.000
Let's be real.

02:41:36.000 --> 02:41:39.000
So I think it's really cool,

02:41:39.000 --> 02:41:42.000
and I think, yeah, I think if you've been looking at the website,

02:41:42.000 --> 02:41:44.000
you've been watching the live streams that Bobby and I were doing

02:41:44.000 --> 02:41:45.000
in the past and stuff, and you think,

02:41:45.000 --> 02:41:48.000
hey, there's something here that interests me, go for it,

02:41:48.000 --> 02:41:50.000
especially if you get on a sale or something like that.

02:41:50.000 --> 02:41:52.000
I don't think it's in the Epic Store,

02:41:52.000 --> 02:41:53.000
so you're not going to get a sale there,

02:41:53.000 --> 02:41:56.000
but, you know, the game has been out for a little while.

02:41:56.000 --> 02:41:59.000
I imagine when these expansions first come out,

02:41:59.000 --> 02:42:01.000
the game's going to go back to full price,

02:42:01.000 --> 02:42:03.000
and that's going to be a big deal.

02:42:04.000 --> 02:42:07.000
And that's kind of what's happened before with these big updates.

02:42:07.000 --> 02:42:09.000
They charge full price for the game again

02:42:09.000 --> 02:42:11.000
because they know people want to buy it again to check it out.

02:42:11.000 --> 02:42:15.000
So if you see a sale kind of before that happens,

02:42:15.000 --> 02:42:18.000
I would say it's a really good time to pick up the game,

02:42:18.000 --> 02:42:21.000
but at the same time, what's wrong with paying full price

02:42:21.000 --> 02:42:24.000
because the developers have shown that they are very committed to this game

02:42:24.000 --> 02:42:27.000
when I think a lot of other people in this industry

02:42:27.000 --> 02:42:29.000
would have walked away from it a long time ago.

02:42:29.000 --> 02:42:31.000
So I think that part is commendable.

02:42:32.000 --> 02:42:33.000
Next email?

02:42:33.000 --> 02:42:34.000
Yes, please.

02:42:34.000 --> 02:42:35.000
All right.

02:42:35.000 --> 02:42:37.000
Hi, all. It's the one and only Metal Mayhem,

02:42:37.000 --> 02:42:39.000
or Raginator, if you'd prefer.

02:42:39.000 --> 02:42:42.000
I thought I'd write in this week with a nostalgia-filled email.

02:42:42.000 --> 02:42:45.000
By the way, it's not a novel, so this is great.

02:42:45.000 --> 02:42:49.000
So as we know, Raginator has been prone to...

02:42:49.000 --> 02:42:50.000
Novels.

02:42:50.000 --> 02:42:51.000
Novels, yes.

02:42:51.000 --> 02:42:52.000
Now it's just a novel question.

02:42:52.000 --> 02:42:54.000
Now it's a novella.

02:42:54.000 --> 02:42:56.000
So let's hop in the way back.

02:42:56.000 --> 02:42:58.000
Okay, first of all, you wrote way back,

02:42:58.000 --> 02:43:01.000
which is okay, but in Rocky and Bullinkle,

02:43:01.000 --> 02:43:04.000
it's an acronym, W-A-B-A-C, way back.

02:43:04.000 --> 02:43:06.000
Just saying.

02:43:06.000 --> 02:43:08.000
So let's hop in the way back machine

02:43:08.000 --> 02:43:10.000
and travel to the days of yore before the days of YouTube,

02:43:10.000 --> 02:43:12.000
Twitch, and their ilk,

02:43:12.000 --> 02:43:14.000
back to the days where if you wanted to find out about a game,

02:43:14.000 --> 02:43:17.000
you had to read magazines, look at kiosks, stores,

02:43:17.000 --> 02:43:19.000
borrow from a friend or rent them,

02:43:19.000 --> 02:43:21.000
and see commercials on TV,

02:43:21.000 --> 02:43:24.000
meaning the 1980s through virtually all of the 90s.

02:43:24.000 --> 02:43:27.000
Growing up in this era as a kid and teen, for me,

02:43:27.000 --> 02:43:30.000
game commercials flooded the airwaves,

02:43:30.000 --> 02:43:32.000
and a lot of these commercials I found to be quite memorable,

02:43:32.000 --> 02:43:35.000
or sold me on specific games and or systems.

02:43:35.000 --> 02:43:38.000
It's hard to forget commercials for games like Super Mario 3,

02:43:38.000 --> 02:43:41.000
people chanting Mario and zooming out to see Mario's face.

02:43:41.000 --> 02:43:43.000
There's the Dr. Mario commercial,

02:43:43.000 --> 02:43:46.000
Donkey Kong Country, Final Fantasy VII,

02:43:46.000 --> 02:43:48.000
multiple versions of that commercial.

02:43:48.000 --> 02:43:50.000
My favorite is the reset button one.

02:43:50.000 --> 02:43:52.000
The Sega yell commercials.

02:43:52.000 --> 02:43:53.000
Sega!

02:43:53.000 --> 02:43:55.000
Mortal Kombat, et cetera.

02:43:55.000 --> 02:43:57.000
Too many to list without droning on.

02:43:57.000 --> 02:43:59.000
A lot of these I remember fondly,

02:43:59.000 --> 02:44:01.000
and have sold me on a game or system.

02:44:01.000 --> 02:44:03.000
All this being said, I pose this question.

02:44:03.000 --> 02:44:08.000
Are there any old school commercials from the 1980s or 1990s

02:44:08.000 --> 02:44:10.000
that were memorable for you,

02:44:10.000 --> 02:44:12.000
or sold you on a game or systems?

02:44:12.000 --> 02:44:14.000
Bonus points will be awarded if Loki says

02:44:14.000 --> 02:44:17.000
the Space Weasel landed on Uranus, just K-L-O-L.

02:44:17.000 --> 02:44:19.000
By the way, this is a very well-written email.

02:44:19.000 --> 02:44:22.000
Besides that crazy last sentence, but okay.

02:44:22.000 --> 02:44:23.000
Okay.

02:44:23.000 --> 02:44:24.000
What about Space Weasel?

02:44:24.000 --> 02:44:25.000
It landed on Uranus.

02:44:25.000 --> 02:44:26.000
It must have been a commercial that I missed.

02:44:26.000 --> 02:44:27.000
I don't know.

02:44:27.000 --> 02:44:28.000
Or he's trying to get you to say something to clip it.

02:44:28.000 --> 02:44:29.000
I don't know.

02:44:29.000 --> 02:44:30.000
All right.

02:44:30.000 --> 02:44:34.000
I remember the old Zelda commercial,

02:44:34.000 --> 02:44:37.000
which didn't sell me on the game, but it was terrible.

02:44:37.000 --> 02:44:38.000
Is that the one where they...

02:44:38.000 --> 02:44:39.000
Because I was going to actually name that one.

02:44:39.000 --> 02:44:40.000
Weevils!

02:44:40.000 --> 02:44:41.000
Yeah, they've got Tektites.

02:44:41.000 --> 02:44:42.000
Leavers!

02:44:42.000 --> 02:44:44.000
They're naming all the enemies in the game.

02:44:44.000 --> 02:44:46.000
And it has nothing to do with the game.

02:44:46.000 --> 02:44:49.000
And nobody remembers the actual names.

02:44:49.000 --> 02:44:51.000
I mean, you might remember like an Octorok and stuff,

02:44:51.000 --> 02:44:53.000
but you don't really remember the names.

02:44:53.000 --> 02:44:57.000
You only remember the Octorok because of either the cartoon or the CDI.

02:44:57.000 --> 02:44:58.000
Or that bad commercial.

02:44:58.000 --> 02:44:59.000
Yes.

02:44:59.000 --> 02:45:00.000
Yeah, one of those.

02:45:00.000 --> 02:45:03.000
You know which one, though, kind of actually got me interested in the game?

02:45:03.000 --> 02:45:06.000
And then when I found out that my papa had it, I was really excited.

02:45:06.000 --> 02:45:08.000
It was the commercial for Abadox.

02:45:08.000 --> 02:45:10.000
It had like this slime come out of the machine.

02:45:10.000 --> 02:45:13.000
And you know me, I'm grossed out by that type of stuff anyway.

02:45:13.000 --> 02:45:16.000
But it says, the world's most disgusting game or something like that.

02:45:16.000 --> 02:45:19.000
And I was like, I kind of won't play that.

02:45:19.000 --> 02:45:22.000
And then my papa had Abadox and I super liked it,

02:45:22.000 --> 02:45:26.000
but I always associated the commercial with being excited to play Abadox.

02:45:26.000 --> 02:45:29.000
Which I had has a classic soundtrack.

02:45:29.000 --> 02:45:33.000
This is a little bit tangenty and not the original question, but too bad.

02:45:33.000 --> 02:45:36.000
Do you remember how much like box art would sell the game to?

02:45:36.000 --> 02:45:39.000
And do you remember a game called Falanix on the Super Nintendo?

02:45:39.000 --> 02:45:40.000
It was like...

02:45:40.000 --> 02:45:41.000
Phalanx.

02:45:41.000 --> 02:45:42.000
Phalanx, that's it.

02:45:42.000 --> 02:45:44.000
And it was, you know, we didn't know how to pronounce the games.

02:45:44.000 --> 02:45:46.000
So, and it was like the box art, and you got to look this up.

02:45:46.000 --> 02:45:48.000
It was like some old dude playing a banjo,

02:45:48.000 --> 02:45:51.000
sitting there while there's like a star going off the side.

02:45:51.000 --> 02:45:52.000
A star going off in the sky.

02:45:52.000 --> 02:45:53.000
It was like a shoot-em-up game.

02:45:53.000 --> 02:45:56.000
And the box art had nothing to do with the game.

02:45:56.000 --> 02:45:58.000
But it was one of those things where it's like, this is so fucking random.

02:45:58.000 --> 02:46:00.000
I remember renting games.

02:46:00.000 --> 02:46:03.000
It's like, what is this old dude with a banjo game?

02:46:03.000 --> 02:46:04.000
I have to try that.

02:46:04.000 --> 02:46:07.000
Because back in the day before there was Twitch,

02:46:07.000 --> 02:46:09.000
I rented a lot of games to test them out.

02:46:09.000 --> 02:46:13.000
And the thing is, is that the Japanese box art

02:46:13.000 --> 02:46:17.000
totally had to do with, you know, what the game fucking is.

02:46:17.000 --> 02:46:18.000
They thought that by putting...

02:46:18.000 --> 02:46:21.000
And like there was an interview or something with the dude

02:46:21.000 --> 02:46:23.000
that designed it or whatever.

02:46:23.000 --> 02:46:26.000
And he was, although the thing I thought was funny about the Japanese one

02:46:26.000 --> 02:46:28.000
is it looks like a giant space dildo.

02:46:28.000 --> 02:46:34.000
But it was done to get that what the fuck factor

02:46:34.000 --> 02:46:35.000
and get people interested in the game

02:46:35.000 --> 02:46:37.000
because they would be talking about the box.

02:46:37.000 --> 02:46:42.000
I am going to link the box art in the chat.

02:46:42.000 --> 02:46:45.000
So Jamie, I know you're doing classic soundtrack this year

02:46:45.000 --> 02:46:47.000
and then you're going to do 16-bit soundtracks next year.

02:46:47.000 --> 02:46:51.000
So in 2021, I think you should do classic box art of the month.

02:46:51.000 --> 02:46:52.000
I could do that.

02:46:52.000 --> 02:46:53.000
Okay.

02:46:53.000 --> 02:46:55.000
Are we going to put that in the Wiki?

02:46:55.000 --> 02:47:00.000
Coming in 2021, classic box art of the month.

02:47:00.000 --> 02:47:04.000
But what I love is that the chatters, of course, already found that.

02:47:04.000 --> 02:47:06.000
And we're putting that up there.

02:47:06.000 --> 02:47:11.000
Doesn't it look like a giant green dildo with balls?

02:47:11.000 --> 02:47:12.000
Anyway.

02:47:12.000 --> 02:47:14.000
Okay, back to the original question.

02:47:14.000 --> 02:47:16.000
I'm sorry, I did a tangent, but you know what?

02:47:16.000 --> 02:47:17.000
It was worth it.

02:47:17.000 --> 02:47:19.000
So commercials.

02:47:19.000 --> 02:47:22.000
I don't remember the video game commercials as much as I remember.

02:47:22.000 --> 02:47:25.000
Okay, you know the commercial from the 80s for like video game related things

02:47:25.000 --> 02:47:27.000
that really sticks out in my mind?

02:47:27.000 --> 02:47:28.000
Nintendo.

02:47:28.000 --> 02:47:30.000
It's for breakfast now.

02:47:30.000 --> 02:47:31.000
Nintendo.

02:47:31.000 --> 02:47:33.000
That's the one I remember.

02:47:33.000 --> 02:47:37.000
Outside of everything else, I remember that goddamn Nintendo serial commercial.

02:47:37.000 --> 02:47:40.000
And then I also remember shows like Starrcade and Nick Arcade

02:47:40.000 --> 02:47:43.000
because those are just fucking commercials for video games.

02:47:43.000 --> 02:47:44.000
Right?

02:47:44.000 --> 02:47:49.000
Well, actually it was watching Starrcade that made me super want a Neo Geo.

02:47:49.000 --> 02:47:50.000
Oh, yeah.

02:47:50.000 --> 02:47:54.000
And then I was like, oh, I'm never going to get a Neo Geo

02:47:54.000 --> 02:47:57.000
because number one, Alabama, you weren't going to find a Neo Geo.

02:47:57.000 --> 02:47:59.000
And then when I did find one place that had a Neo Geo,

02:47:59.000 --> 02:48:04.000
it was like 800 bucks in the early 90s.

02:48:04.000 --> 02:48:05.000
And then guess what happened?

02:48:05.000 --> 02:48:08.000
I moved out here and guess what Dan had?

02:48:08.000 --> 02:48:10.000
A fucking Neo Geo.

02:48:10.000 --> 02:48:12.000
Look, Neo Geo.

02:48:12.000 --> 02:48:13.000
Did you marry for a Neo Geo?

02:48:13.000 --> 02:48:16.000
I did marry him for a Neo Geo.

02:48:16.000 --> 02:48:18.000
You know how he got it, right?

02:48:18.000 --> 02:48:20.000
He traded a Sega CD for it.

02:48:20.000 --> 02:48:21.000
Oh, wow.

02:48:21.000 --> 02:48:22.000
Yep.

02:48:22.000 --> 02:48:23.000
And guess what we have now?

02:48:23.000 --> 02:48:26.000
A bunch of Sega CDs and a CDX.

02:48:26.000 --> 02:48:27.000
Time does a lot.

02:48:27.000 --> 02:48:34.000
Loki, do you remember any commercials, gaming commercials as a kid growing up?

02:48:34.000 --> 02:48:36.000
No, I don't.

02:48:36.000 --> 02:48:38.000
I don't remember any, unfortunately.

02:48:38.000 --> 02:48:39.000
All right.

02:48:39.000 --> 02:48:40.000
Fair enough.

02:48:40.000 --> 02:48:41.000
I remember.

02:48:41.000 --> 02:48:44.000
Was it Mario 3 where everybody was standing out in the street streaming Mario, Mario?

02:48:44.000 --> 02:48:46.000
That was the one he mentioned in the game.

02:48:46.000 --> 02:48:47.000
Okay, so it was.

02:48:47.000 --> 02:48:48.000
I do remember that one, too.

02:48:48.000 --> 02:48:50.000
About the panning out and it being Mario's face.

02:48:50.000 --> 02:48:51.000
Yeah, see, you named all the good ones.

02:48:51.000 --> 02:48:53.000
But the ones that really, and I'll put it this way,

02:48:53.000 --> 02:48:58.000
the ones that made me actually want to play a game were ones that showed game play.

02:48:58.000 --> 02:49:01.000
And, you know, and I'll be honest,

02:49:01.000 --> 02:49:04.000
I had already kind of gotten out of my watching TV phase

02:49:04.000 --> 02:49:09.000
probably in like my early college years to like 96, 97.

02:49:09.000 --> 02:49:11.000
I wasn't really watching a lot of TV, except for.

02:49:11.000 --> 02:49:13.000
I was raised on Nickelodeon.

02:49:13.000 --> 02:49:19.000
Except for Saturday Night Live and 120 Minutes and Headbangers Ball.

02:49:19.000 --> 02:49:20.000
That was like my.

02:49:20.000 --> 02:49:21.000
I mean, I would watch some stuff.

02:49:21.000 --> 02:49:23.000
I still watch cartoons, you know, and I was watching my anime,

02:49:23.000 --> 02:49:27.000
but I wasn't really watching a lot of like packaged TV.

02:49:27.000 --> 02:49:29.000
So I missed a lot of commercials in the late 90s.

02:49:29.000 --> 02:49:32.000
You know, you know who were celebrities to me growing up

02:49:32.000 --> 02:49:34.000
or those kids on You Can't Do That on television.

02:49:34.000 --> 02:49:35.000
That's how much Nickelodeon I watched.

02:49:35.000 --> 02:49:37.000
You and your Alanis.

02:49:37.000 --> 02:49:38.000
No, it's not even that.

02:49:38.000 --> 02:49:41.000
Like that in some ways, that connection is just very random

02:49:41.000 --> 02:49:43.000
because she was only on like two episodes of the show.

02:49:43.000 --> 02:49:44.000
That's the part they don't tell you.

02:49:44.000 --> 02:49:46.000
She wasn't like she wasn't like Lisa Ruddy or something.

02:49:46.000 --> 02:49:48.000
She was only on two episodes of show.

02:49:48.000 --> 02:49:52.000
But anyway, yeah, like I those were like celebrities that

02:49:52.000 --> 02:49:55.000
and the cast of Clue, the movie were like celebrities to me.

02:49:55.000 --> 02:49:58.000
So I've always I love they were celebrities anyway.

02:49:58.000 --> 02:50:01.000
I love Tim Curry long before the Rocky Horror Picture Show,

02:50:01.000 --> 02:50:02.000
believe it or not.

02:50:02.000 --> 02:50:05.000
Well, well, yeah, because I mean, there was Annie.

02:50:05.000 --> 02:50:06.000
I love that movie.

02:50:06.000 --> 02:50:07.000
Worst Witch.

02:50:07.000 --> 02:50:08.000
Right.

02:50:08.000 --> 02:50:09.000
I didn't really see the Worst Witch.

02:50:09.000 --> 02:50:10.000
Labyrinth.

02:50:10.000 --> 02:50:11.000
Not Labyrinth.

02:50:11.000 --> 02:50:12.000
Legend.

02:50:12.000 --> 02:50:13.000
Legend.

02:50:13.000 --> 02:50:14.000
Which I still can't watch all the way through.

02:50:14.000 --> 02:50:16.000
I don't think I watched Legend growing up.

02:50:16.000 --> 02:50:17.000
I don't remember watching it until way later.

02:50:17.000 --> 02:50:19.000
He played the devil and it was beautiful.

02:50:19.000 --> 02:50:20.000
I've seen it now.

02:50:20.000 --> 02:50:25.000
But yeah, but it it, you know.

02:50:25.000 --> 02:50:28.000
I don't funny enough, even though I do all the white face

02:50:28.000 --> 02:50:31.000
and drag makeup, I am still scared of clowns.

02:50:31.000 --> 02:50:32.000
Sure.

02:50:32.000 --> 02:50:33.000
True story.

02:50:34.000 --> 02:50:38.000
But like like I somewhat I actually saw someone walking

02:50:38.000 --> 02:50:39.000
out of Party City.

02:50:39.000 --> 02:50:44.000
Yes, I went to Party City to build the one by my

02:50:44.000 --> 02:50:45.000
I'll just say Delta Shores.

02:50:45.000 --> 02:50:46.000
Yeah, it's closing.

02:50:46.000 --> 02:50:48.000
That's that's I just I went there and that's where I got

02:50:48.000 --> 02:50:50.000
because I was hosting a masquerade burlesque thing

02:50:50.000 --> 02:50:52.000
and I got a purple mask like 50 cents.

02:50:52.000 --> 02:50:56.000
I was going to get, though, a mug man mask to put on the wall

02:50:56.000 --> 02:50:57.000
and it was damaged.

02:50:57.000 --> 02:50:58.000
I messaged you about it.

02:50:58.000 --> 02:51:00.000
I'm going to I'm going to put on what I got for $14

02:51:00.000 --> 02:51:01.000
at Party City.

02:51:01.000 --> 02:51:02.000
OK, well, while you're doing that,

02:51:03.000 --> 02:51:06.000
you know, I I was going to say, you know,

02:51:08.000 --> 02:51:12.000
that was the movie for me that made me fall in love

02:51:12.000 --> 02:51:13.000
with Madeline Kahn.

02:51:13.000 --> 02:51:16.000
And, you know, I already knew Leslie Ann Warren

02:51:16.000 --> 02:51:17.000
from other movies.

02:51:17.000 --> 02:51:19.000
I don't know what else she's done since then.

02:51:20.000 --> 02:51:21.000
Mission Impossible.

02:51:21.000 --> 02:51:23.000
OK, Rob says Mission Impossible.

02:51:25.000 --> 02:51:28.000
But I mean, that was kind of the thing.

02:51:28.000 --> 02:51:29.000
I mean.

02:51:30.000 --> 02:51:31.000
I don't really, though.

02:51:33.000 --> 02:51:34.000
I can't think of anything else.

02:51:35.000 --> 02:51:37.000
What were other things that you remember?

02:51:38.000 --> 02:51:39.000
Here's Rob's back.

02:51:40.000 --> 02:51:42.000
I had a feeling you'd get the purple jacket.

02:51:43.000 --> 02:51:45.000
Did you see this on the rack?

02:51:45.000 --> 02:51:46.000
I was going to buy that.

02:51:46.000 --> 02:51:49.000
I know I actually I almost I came really close

02:51:49.000 --> 02:51:51.000
to buy one for one of the sisters who loves purple.

02:51:52.000 --> 02:51:54.000
And there were two on the rack about the large one,

02:51:54.000 --> 02:51:55.000
which still won't even button.

02:51:55.000 --> 02:51:56.000
I don't know what that says.

02:51:56.000 --> 02:51:59.000
But don't I look like the Grimace and the Hamburglar

02:51:59.000 --> 02:52:00.000
had a baby?

02:52:00.000 --> 02:52:01.000
Kind of.

02:52:01.000 --> 02:52:02.000
Yeah. So there you go.

02:52:03.000 --> 02:52:05.000
You're you're the gay agenda.

02:52:06.000 --> 02:52:08.000
Rob's costume is the gay agenda.

02:52:08.000 --> 02:52:10.000
I'm here to steal the gay agenda.

02:52:10.000 --> 02:52:12.000
No. So, yeah, I bought this and I'm even wearing

02:52:12.000 --> 02:52:13.000
a purple shirt right now.

02:52:13.000 --> 02:52:14.000
So it works out. Yes.

02:52:14.000 --> 02:52:16.000
So I bought this suit top for 14 bucks.

02:52:16.000 --> 02:52:17.000
I'm sorry.

02:52:17.000 --> 02:52:18.000
I bought a leotard.

02:52:18.000 --> 02:52:21.000
But it's it's a hideous purple suit and I love it.

02:52:21.000 --> 02:52:22.000
I bought a leotard.

02:52:22.000 --> 02:52:23.000
You know what you should do?

02:52:23.000 --> 02:52:24.000
What? Stone it.

02:52:24.000 --> 02:52:25.000
Stone the jacket?

02:52:25.000 --> 02:52:26.000
Stone the jacket.

02:52:26.000 --> 02:52:27.000
Stone the lapels.

02:52:28.000 --> 02:52:29.000
Oh, my God.

02:52:29.000 --> 02:52:30.000
I love that idea.

02:52:30.000 --> 02:52:31.000
Or like on the back.

02:52:31.000 --> 02:52:33.000
I'll put something in purple rhinestones.

02:52:33.000 --> 02:52:34.000
You know what I have?

02:52:34.000 --> 02:52:35.000
What?

02:52:35.000 --> 02:52:36.000
I have a black a black felt skull.

02:52:36.000 --> 02:52:37.000
You know what I want?

02:52:37.000 --> 02:52:38.000
A bedazzler.

02:52:39.000 --> 02:52:40.000
Well, no, we take the dazzle.

02:52:40.000 --> 02:52:42.000
The shit that has happened to this show.

02:52:43.000 --> 02:52:46.000
We take that that black felt skull of mine.

02:52:46.000 --> 02:52:49.000
Don't you think I take this show seriously?

02:52:49.000 --> 02:52:50.000
No, no, no, no.

02:52:50.000 --> 02:52:51.000
Listen to my idea.

02:52:51.000 --> 02:52:52.000
It's great.

02:52:52.000 --> 02:52:54.000
And we glitter gold glitter it.

02:52:55.000 --> 02:52:57.000
And put that on the back of the jacket.

02:52:57.000 --> 02:53:02.000
So I just want to point out if Metal Mayhem was sending in an email to completely derail

02:53:02.000 --> 02:53:04.000
this show with his innocent question.

02:53:04.000 --> 02:53:05.000
Congratulations.

02:53:05.000 --> 02:53:06.000
You succeeded.

02:53:08.000 --> 02:53:09.000
All right.

02:53:11.000 --> 02:53:12.000
Let's move on.

02:53:13.000 --> 02:53:14.000
You want to do another story for us?

02:53:14.000 --> 02:53:17.000
Like, would you like do you want to talk about video games?

02:53:17.000 --> 02:53:18.000
Yes, let's talk about video games.

02:53:18.000 --> 02:53:20.000
We're not talking about video games.

02:53:20.000 --> 02:53:21.000
All right.

02:53:21.000 --> 02:53:22.000
It's low key.

02:53:22.000 --> 02:53:24.000
Tell us about video games while I take this stuff off.

02:53:24.000 --> 02:53:25.000
All right.

02:53:25.000 --> 02:53:29.000
So Sega has announced some more games that are going to be coming to the Genesis mini

02:53:29.000 --> 02:53:35.000
console pretty soon, including Mega Man, the Wily Wars, Street Fighter II special championship

02:53:35.000 --> 02:53:40.000
or special champion edition and Ghouls and Ghosts.

02:53:40.000 --> 02:53:44.000
Along with that, though, there's going to be some other additional games that were announced

02:53:44.000 --> 02:53:48.000
as well from other people or other publishers other than Capcom.

02:53:48.000 --> 02:53:53.000
So we have Alex Kidd in the Enchanted Castle, Beyond Oasis, Golden Axe, Fantasy Star 4,

02:53:53.000 --> 02:53:59.000
The End of the Millennium, Sonic Spinball, Vector Man and Wonder Boy in Monster World.

02:53:59.000 --> 02:54:00.000
Squeak.

02:54:01.000 --> 02:54:03.000
So that's what we have announced so far.

02:54:03.000 --> 02:54:04.000
30 games announced so far.

02:54:04.000 --> 02:54:06.000
So I'm wondering, is there more?

02:54:06.000 --> 02:54:10.000
And though now that they've announced all of their cap.

02:54:10.000 --> 02:54:14.000
I don't know if it's all of the Capcom games, but they are mentioning Capcom games.

02:54:14.000 --> 02:54:17.000
Sadly, it doesn't sound like there's any.

02:54:17.000 --> 02:54:18.000
I don't.

02:54:18.000 --> 02:54:19.000
Was the Lion King.

02:54:19.000 --> 02:54:23.000
I think Aladdin was Capcom, though, wasn't it?

02:54:23.000 --> 02:54:24.000
Or was that claim?

02:54:24.000 --> 02:54:29.000
I think Capcom had a Disney license back then because they're the ones that did like DuckTales

02:54:29.000 --> 02:54:30.000
on the NES.

02:54:30.000 --> 02:54:31.000
I remember that.

02:54:31.000 --> 02:54:35.000
But like, I don't remember if like a claim did like the Lion King and stuff like that.

02:54:35.000 --> 02:54:38.000
Those are probably going to be trickier licenses to get anyway.

02:54:38.000 --> 02:54:40.000
There's there's more IP involved with.

02:54:40.000 --> 02:54:42.000
Yeah, for sure.

02:54:42.000 --> 02:54:44.000
They have the Mickey Mouse game, though.

02:54:44.000 --> 02:54:46.000
It says Aladdin on Super Nintendo was Capcom.

02:54:46.000 --> 02:54:48.000
Genesis was Virgin.

02:54:48.000 --> 02:54:53.000
So maybe maybe the different platforms had different license.

02:54:53.000 --> 02:54:55.000
Well, they have Castle of Illusion, World of Illusion.

02:54:55.000 --> 02:54:59.000
So, I mean, they've been having some talks with Disney.

02:54:59.000 --> 02:55:00.000
There you go.

02:55:00.000 --> 02:55:01.000
All right.

02:55:01.000 --> 02:55:03.000
Well, moving on, I suppose.

02:55:03.000 --> 02:55:06.000
Let's talk about some drama with Call of Duty.

02:55:06.000 --> 02:55:09.000
There may be some changes going on for 2020.

02:55:09.000 --> 02:55:14.000
Your reliable schedule of what Call of Duty games come out, which years may be changing a little bit.

02:55:14.000 --> 02:55:19.000
Apparently, there are some insider sources claiming that Activision changed from the original plan.

02:55:19.000 --> 02:55:22.000
So instead of Raven and Sledgehammer doing a single player game,

02:55:22.000 --> 02:55:26.000
Treyarch is going to be doing Black Ops 5 in 2020.

02:55:26.000 --> 02:55:29.000
It's going to be a Cold War set game is what they're saying.

02:55:29.000 --> 02:55:35.000
Raven and Sledgehammer are going to be doing supporting studios adding a story to this title,

02:55:35.000 --> 02:55:37.000
which is apparently pretty multiplayer heavy.

02:55:37.000 --> 02:55:40.000
Yeah, that's what Black Ops 4 was and meh.

02:55:40.000 --> 02:55:42.000
They're going to be saying it's cross-gen.

02:55:42.000 --> 02:55:46.000
So they're saying it's going to be like PlayStation 5 as well as PlayStation 4.

02:55:46.000 --> 02:55:47.000
Going to kind of do that.

02:55:47.000 --> 02:55:54.000
And this year, at least in 2019, Modern Warfare is expected just that it's going to be a return to the Modern Warfare.

02:55:54.000 --> 02:56:00.000
There may be a free-to-play part of that as well, like Fortnite, Apex Legends, the Battle Royale type of free-to-play.

02:56:00.000 --> 02:56:01.000
We'll see.

02:56:01.000 --> 02:56:02.000
We don't know.

02:56:02.000 --> 02:56:05.000
I mean, again, they're all saying subject to change, right?

02:56:05.000 --> 02:56:08.000
But what should be also noted, Eric, because everybody loves a little drama,

02:56:08.000 --> 02:56:11.000
apparently the shakeup might be because of internal turmoil.

02:56:11.000 --> 02:56:15.000
Raven and Sledgehammer are arguing frequently during the development of this game.

02:56:15.000 --> 02:56:16.000
Yikes.

02:56:16.000 --> 02:56:18.000
So we'll see, though.

02:56:18.000 --> 02:56:23.000
I mean, E3 is just a few weeks away, and I'm sure they're going to announce at least this year's plan there,

02:56:23.000 --> 02:56:25.000
even though we might have to wait a little longer until 2020.

02:56:25.000 --> 02:56:26.000
Is Activision in it?

02:56:26.000 --> 02:56:29.000
Oh, they always do something during like Xbox or PlayStation.

02:56:29.000 --> 02:56:33.000
Yeah, they'll kind of team up with one of the, well, Sony's not there this year.

02:56:33.000 --> 02:56:36.000
So if they're going to show anything, they're going to show it during Microsoft.

02:56:36.000 --> 02:56:37.000
Yeah.

02:56:37.000 --> 02:56:38.000
Or they'll do their own thing.

02:56:38.000 --> 02:56:39.000
Yeah.

02:56:39.000 --> 02:56:45.000
So I wonder if Sony's doing like a stream of some, you know, how they like do the like their inside.

02:56:45.000 --> 02:56:50.000
You know, they haven't time and dated one, so either they're going to do it right before or maybe right after.

02:56:50.000 --> 02:56:53.000
But I doubt that they wouldn't have any announcements that they're going to make.

02:56:53.000 --> 02:56:55.000
I just think maybe they're not going to be there.

02:56:55.000 --> 02:57:02.000
You would think that they want to be part of like the conversation and not just they're relying on third parties to make because Square Enix kind of took their spot.

02:57:02.000 --> 02:57:06.000
So maybe Square Enix is going to be talking about PlayStation titles, you know, and that's what they're hoping.

02:57:06.000 --> 02:57:08.000
Alrighty, we'll see.

02:57:08.000 --> 02:57:11.000
Yeah, Bobby Blackwolf in chat says they'll do a state of play that week, I'm sure.

02:57:11.000 --> 02:57:15.000
I don't know if it will be quite as timed at the same time as E3.

02:57:15.000 --> 02:57:22.000
It might be later in the week once people kind of stop talking about the it would be smart, I think, for Sony to kind of do that if they're going to do it like later in the week.

02:57:22.000 --> 02:57:24.000
But we'll see.

02:57:24.000 --> 02:57:29.000
Anyway, SSJ100 Matt says Sony is probably under lock and key because of all the leaks in the past.

02:57:29.000 --> 02:57:30.000
Who knows?

02:57:30.000 --> 02:57:34.000
Anyway, Dark Soccer, let's go to a story I know you're excited about, right?

02:57:34.000 --> 02:57:40.000
Yes, I think I giggled and then, you know, messaged Dan immediately about it.

02:57:40.000 --> 02:57:45.000
And I'm going to read the translation from Famitsu directly.

02:57:45.000 --> 02:57:49.000
So, anyway.

02:57:49.000 --> 02:58:00.000
Sankatsu Sagi Nomori company is announcing today, that was March 19th, that they're starting to publish a game software for home consoles via their game department.

02:58:00.000 --> 02:58:01.000
Beep!

02:58:01.000 --> 02:58:03.000
I just think it's funny it's called Beep.

02:58:03.000 --> 02:58:08.000
And their first release is the latest game on the Cotton series called Cotton Reboot.

02:58:08.000 --> 02:58:09.000
Oh, I love Cotton!

02:58:09.000 --> 02:58:19.000
It'll be released to Nintendo Switch, PS4, and Steam and is based on the brush up version of Cotton for the X68000, which is a pretty good copy version of Cotton.

02:58:19.000 --> 02:58:20.000
I'm excited.

02:58:20.000 --> 02:58:22.000
And I don't fucking care.

02:58:22.000 --> 02:58:25.000
I'm going to do whatever it takes to get this goddamn game.

02:58:25.000 --> 02:58:27.000
There's no lockout.

02:58:27.000 --> 02:58:28.000
Yeah, there's no regional lock on Switch.

02:58:28.000 --> 02:58:29.000
It's going to be mine.

02:58:29.000 --> 02:58:30.000
Yeah.

02:58:30.000 --> 02:58:32.000
I'm pretty familiar with Cotton for whatever reason.

02:58:32.000 --> 02:58:34.000
It's like a shoot-em-up but with witches, right?

02:58:34.000 --> 02:58:38.000
Yeah, and she's addicted to this candy called Willow, which apparently is really nasty and makes her throw up.

02:58:38.000 --> 02:58:42.000
But she also enslaves fairies to fight for her.

02:58:42.000 --> 02:58:43.000
Cool.

02:58:43.000 --> 02:58:49.000
And I have, one of the best games I have on my Dreamcast is Panorama Cotton.

02:58:49.000 --> 02:58:50.000
Not Panorama Cotton.

02:58:50.000 --> 02:58:53.000
That was the Genesis one that they made 600 of.

02:58:53.000 --> 02:58:54.000
Rainbow Cotton.

02:58:54.000 --> 02:58:58.000
But this one is the side-scrolling classic Cotton.

02:58:59.000 --> 02:59:04.000
That means I actually will be able to legit cosplay her now, like I've wanted to.

02:59:04.000 --> 02:59:05.000
Alright.

02:59:05.000 --> 02:59:07.000
Because she's adorbs.

02:59:07.000 --> 02:59:08.000
Well, let's move on.

02:59:08.000 --> 02:59:11.000
A couple more stories for you guys, then we're going to get to our listener roundtable.

02:59:11.000 --> 02:59:15.000
But I am going to caution you guys, I'm not going to wait too long to see if anyone wants to call.

02:59:15.000 --> 02:59:19.000
Because the show is running a little long, so I do want to wrap up.

02:59:19.000 --> 02:59:22.000
In other words, the window is not going to be very big.

02:59:22.000 --> 02:59:25.000
If you want to get in on the show, get in that green room ASAP.

02:59:25.000 --> 02:59:27.000
Otherwise, we may just wrap up.

02:59:27.000 --> 02:59:31.000
But for now, we've got a couple other stories, including some big stuff going on in the Minecraft world right now.

02:59:31.000 --> 02:59:38.000
Yeah, so Minecraft had their 10-year celebration this week, so they were talking about different things.

02:59:38.000 --> 02:59:42.000
So one of them is that they've sold 176 million copies worldwide.

02:59:42.000 --> 02:59:43.000
That's a lot of copies.

02:59:43.000 --> 02:59:45.000
That is a lot of copies.

02:59:46.000 --> 02:59:52.000
There's also the original version of Minecraft that's free to play on web browsers now, if you wanted to.

02:59:52.000 --> 02:59:54.000
Right, didn't that come up on last week's show?

02:59:54.000 --> 02:59:55.000
Oh yeah, we did talk about that.

02:59:55.000 --> 02:59:59.000
Because we knew they were going to announce something on the 17th, we just didn't know what that was yet.

02:59:59.000 --> 03:00:06.000
Right, exactly. And that something is Minecraft Earth, which is like a Pokemon Go type of game.

03:00:06.000 --> 03:00:11.000
It's basically an AR game where you can build in the real world, and it persists there.

03:00:11.000 --> 03:00:18.000
So if you have the app, you can draw dicks literally everywhere, and they're just going to be there for you to run into.

03:00:18.000 --> 03:00:19.000
World of dicks.

03:00:19.000 --> 03:00:22.000
It's just dicks literally everywhere.

03:00:22.000 --> 03:00:24.000
It's just going to be so amazing.

03:00:24.000 --> 03:00:25.000
Dick's earth.

03:00:25.000 --> 03:00:28.000
But apparently there's going to be some other stuff that you can do in the game.

03:00:28.000 --> 03:00:30.000
They haven't really kind of explained what you can do.

03:00:30.000 --> 03:00:32.000
So I could go to your house and build a dick on the roof.

03:00:32.000 --> 03:00:33.000
Yes, you could.

03:00:35.000 --> 03:00:36.000
That's awesome.

03:00:36.000 --> 03:00:42.000
But you can also build stuff, I think, in actual Minecraft and export it out.

03:00:42.000 --> 03:00:47.000
You are somehow going to gather resources also throughout the world.

03:00:47.000 --> 03:00:49.000
So you'll be able to get blocks that way and stuff.

03:00:49.000 --> 03:00:51.000
But I think it's awesome, I signed it for the beta.

03:00:52.000 --> 03:00:55.000
You can do that. They have it on their website, you can sign up for it.

03:00:55.000 --> 03:00:57.000
I think it's also worth noting.

03:00:57.000 --> 03:01:02.000
I know a lot of the blogs and things and social media saying it's like Pokemon Go.

03:01:02.000 --> 03:01:06.000
I think the only thing they have in common is their AR games.

03:01:06.000 --> 03:01:09.000
But you're not collecting little Minecraft creatures.

03:01:09.000 --> 03:01:10.000
It's nothing like that.

03:01:10.000 --> 03:01:18.000
It's just basically the AR concept of what I do over here in my park drawing a giant, we'll say boobs now because we've done a lot of dick.

03:01:18.000 --> 03:01:24.000
So if I draw boobs in my park, then you can come to my park and you're going to see these boobs that I drew.

03:01:24.000 --> 03:01:26.000
Because you're going to see the world through your phone.

03:01:26.000 --> 03:01:27.000
Yes.

03:01:27.000 --> 03:01:29.000
Yes, booby world or whatever.

03:01:29.000 --> 03:01:31.000
Yes, it'll be amazing.

03:01:31.000 --> 03:01:34.000
There will be no harassment in this game whatsoever, I'm sure of it.

03:01:34.000 --> 03:01:38.000
I'm just going to go around drawing vulvas for everybody.

03:01:38.000 --> 03:01:44.000
Every school is going to be like, fuck this place with a big arrow pointing at it.

03:01:44.000 --> 03:01:53.000
If you give humanity a giant blank canvas to write down all their thoughts and feelings, you're just asking for trouble.

03:01:53.000 --> 03:01:54.000
You know what I mean?

03:01:54.000 --> 03:01:59.000
Oh my god, can you imagine what people are going to build around the White House?

03:01:59.000 --> 03:02:00.000
It's going to be glorious.

03:02:00.000 --> 03:02:05.000
I'm very curious how this game is going to be moderated.

03:02:05.000 --> 03:02:07.000
Will dicks be allowed, yes or no?

03:02:07.000 --> 03:02:09.000
Walls of fire.

03:02:09.000 --> 03:02:10.000
Alright.

03:02:10.000 --> 03:02:14.000
Yes, Dark Tetsuya says, so time to penis or TTP for this Minecraft.

03:02:14.000 --> 03:02:15.000
Oh, immediately.

03:02:15.000 --> 03:02:16.000
Several nanoseconds.

03:02:16.000 --> 03:02:17.000
Yeah, immediately.

03:02:17.000 --> 03:02:19.000
They'll be, within the first week there'll be articles on Kotaku.

03:02:19.000 --> 03:02:20.000
In beta.

03:02:20.000 --> 03:02:21.000
In beta.

03:02:21.000 --> 03:02:23.000
There will be like, because I'm sure there'll be a beta.

03:02:23.000 --> 03:02:34.000
And hey, if I get in the Minecraft beta, the first thing I'm going to do, look, I swear here and now, the first thing I'm going to do when I get access to Minecraft Earth is I'm going to go draw a dick on Loki's roof.

03:02:34.000 --> 03:02:37.000
That is going to be the first thing I'm going to do.

03:02:37.000 --> 03:02:44.000
So sorry to give away where you live here on air, but just look for the giant dick because I'll have built it.

03:02:44.000 --> 03:02:46.000
Alright.

03:02:46.000 --> 03:02:49.000
Moving on, one more story for you guys tonight.

03:02:49.000 --> 03:02:53.000
And it's a little bit timely because it is episode 777 after all.

03:02:53.000 --> 03:02:55.000
So why not a story about gambling?

03:02:55.000 --> 03:02:56.000
Yeah.

03:02:56.000 --> 03:03:00.000
So Unity, the video game creation platform, right?

03:03:00.000 --> 03:03:06.000
Not Unreal is kind of the other big one, but Unity is one of the big game writing and publishing platforms.

03:03:06.000 --> 03:03:10.000
And Unity, they wrote kind of a controversial tweet, a blood post.

03:03:10.000 --> 03:03:11.000
A blood post.

03:03:11.000 --> 03:03:12.000
They wrote it in blood.

03:03:12.000 --> 03:03:13.000
They pricked their finger.

03:03:13.000 --> 03:03:15.000
What is wrong with my voice tonight?

03:03:15.000 --> 03:03:20.000
A blog post talking about some of the features of the Unity engine.

03:03:20.000 --> 03:03:21.000
You know, kind of like promotion things.

03:03:21.000 --> 03:03:25.000
A lot of it was just like the typical things you would expect, you know, as far as promotion.

03:03:25.000 --> 03:03:30.000
But what was also interesting was that it referenced upcoming features for gambling games.

03:03:30.000 --> 03:03:32.000
Because, you know, a lot of like video...

03:03:32.000 --> 03:03:34.000
Like, what does Konami do now?

03:03:34.000 --> 03:03:36.000
It's not just pachinko jokes and stuff.

03:03:36.000 --> 03:03:40.000
Like, go to any casino and look for the Konami logo.

03:03:40.000 --> 03:03:41.000
It's everywhere.

03:03:41.000 --> 03:03:44.000
So, yeah.

03:03:44.000 --> 03:03:47.000
So anyway.

03:03:47.000 --> 03:03:52.000
That is, yeah, that's a thing that Unity got kind of razzed for a little bit.

03:03:53.000 --> 03:03:55.000
And they pulled their post and they wrote a little tweet saying,

03:03:55.000 --> 03:04:02.000
based on your feedback today, we removed a tweet and blog post relating to some upcoming 2019.1 features

03:04:02.000 --> 03:04:05.000
that are useful to creators of real money games.

03:04:05.000 --> 03:04:07.000
You know, because they got called unethical.

03:04:07.000 --> 03:04:10.000
You know, we had the addiction story earlier on, obviously.

03:04:10.000 --> 03:04:12.000
You know, gambling addiction is a very real thing.

03:04:12.000 --> 03:04:16.000
And video game, fakie gambling things kind of...

03:04:16.000 --> 03:04:19.000
When I say fakie, I mean like online gaming.

03:04:19.000 --> 03:04:26.000
Because, you know, on the dark web, if you will, you get a lot of ads for real money gambling sites and stuff.

03:04:26.000 --> 03:04:28.000
Because that's something you can do in some places.

03:04:28.000 --> 03:04:32.000
So, you know, maybe Unity doesn't want to embrace that so much.

03:04:32.000 --> 03:04:33.000
I don't know.

03:04:33.000 --> 03:04:35.000
But anyway.

03:04:35.000 --> 03:04:38.000
Yeah, the original tweet, just so you know, said,

03:04:38.000 --> 03:04:44.000
we recently delivered our first release of the year, Unity 2019.1, which includes about 300 features.

03:04:44.000 --> 03:04:48.000
Many of which are especially helpful for developers in the gambling industry.

03:04:48.000 --> 03:04:49.000
Well, woohoo.

03:04:51.000 --> 03:04:52.000
Anyway.

03:04:53.000 --> 03:04:54.000
There you go.

03:04:54.000 --> 03:04:56.000
That's the Unity issue.

03:04:56.000 --> 03:05:00.000
Do you think there's an issue with Unity supporting gambling games?

03:05:00.000 --> 03:05:01.000
I mean, it's kind of one of the...

03:05:01.000 --> 03:05:02.000
I don't know. Like, it's kind of...

03:05:02.000 --> 03:05:03.000
We all know it's happening.

03:05:03.000 --> 03:05:05.000
I mean, I understand where maybe it's not...

03:05:05.000 --> 03:05:06.000
Just making it easier for...

03:05:06.000 --> 03:05:07.000
I don't...

03:05:07.000 --> 03:05:08.000
It's just a game engine.

03:05:08.000 --> 03:05:09.000
Who cares?

03:05:09.000 --> 03:05:10.000
Yeah.

03:05:11.000 --> 03:05:13.000
You can do a lot in Unity.

03:05:13.000 --> 03:05:16.000
You can make porn games in Unity.

03:05:16.000 --> 03:05:19.000
But we don't talk about that, Loki.

03:05:19.000 --> 03:05:21.000
But, I mean, you can do whatever you want in Unity.

03:05:21.000 --> 03:05:23.000
It's a game engine, so it's...

03:05:23.000 --> 03:05:25.000
Who makes the games is who you gotta...

03:05:25.000 --> 03:05:26.000
I don't know.

03:05:26.000 --> 03:05:27.000
I don't think...

03:05:27.000 --> 03:05:30.000
I guess it's because they're making it easier that shame on them.

03:05:30.000 --> 03:05:31.000
Yeah.

03:05:31.000 --> 03:05:32.000
Alright.

03:05:32.000 --> 03:05:33.000
Anyway.

03:05:33.000 --> 03:05:35.000
Did you just make a Game of Thrones reference, by the way?

03:05:35.000 --> 03:05:36.000
You did shame?

03:05:36.000 --> 03:05:37.000
I hear you say shame.

03:05:37.000 --> 03:05:38.000
No, shame on them.

03:05:38.000 --> 03:05:39.000
Yeah.

03:05:39.000 --> 03:05:40.000
It looks like you're ringing a bell.

03:05:40.000 --> 03:05:41.000
No, I'm not.

03:05:41.000 --> 03:05:42.000
Alright, anyway.

03:05:42.000 --> 03:05:44.000
It's time for the Listener Round Table.

03:05:44.000 --> 03:05:49.000
So if you wanna give us a call, you can via our Discord, if you wanna join our green room.

03:05:49.000 --> 03:05:53.000
Or you can send us a question in the chat room, if you want to.

03:05:53.000 --> 03:05:54.000
Get that in real quick.

03:05:54.000 --> 03:05:55.000
Let me check, though, real quick on Loki.

03:05:55.000 --> 03:05:57.000
See if there's any last minute stories.

03:05:57.000 --> 03:05:58.000
I don't know if there was.

03:05:58.000 --> 03:05:59.000
I think we kinda...

03:05:59.000 --> 03:06:00.000
No.

03:06:00.000 --> 03:06:01.000
We hit a lot.

03:06:01.000 --> 03:06:02.000
I mean...

03:06:02.000 --> 03:06:05.000
To be honest, I'm just very scared to even go out on the internet right now.

03:06:05.000 --> 03:06:06.000
Oh, because, yeah, what have it.

03:06:06.000 --> 03:06:07.000
Yeah, I understand.

03:06:07.000 --> 03:06:09.000
So, I'm gonna say no.

03:06:09.000 --> 03:06:10.000
Alright.

03:06:10.000 --> 03:06:11.000
What do you plan to do on...

03:06:11.000 --> 03:06:13.000
So, obviously, we know Dark Sakura is gonna be out of town.

03:06:13.000 --> 03:06:14.000
I'm gonna be out of town.

03:06:14.000 --> 03:06:16.000
What are you gonna do with your holiday weekend?

03:06:16.000 --> 03:06:18.000
You thinking about doing some streaming?

03:06:18.000 --> 03:06:20.000
I'm probably gonna try to stream on Sunday.

03:06:20.000 --> 03:06:21.000
We'll see if I get around to it.

03:06:21.000 --> 03:06:22.000
Unless, let's...

03:06:22.000 --> 03:06:23.000
I'm gonna...

03:06:23.000 --> 03:06:30.000
Listen, I'm not going with the kids, because I spend, like, all weekend with them.

03:06:30.000 --> 03:06:31.000
I just don't want to.

03:06:31.000 --> 03:06:34.000
Like, any time now, they're like, take us somewhere fun!

03:06:34.000 --> 03:06:37.000
And, like, I had to spend a ton of money on them.

03:06:37.000 --> 03:06:39.000
They're like, we only get $10 to spend in the arcade.

03:06:39.000 --> 03:06:42.000
I'm like, dude, that's like 30 bucks for all of us to play arcade games.

03:06:42.000 --> 03:06:47.000
And you guys are gonna blow it in, like, two minutes, because you're gonna play the stupid, you know, Flappy Bird.

03:06:47.000 --> 03:06:50.000
Well, sometimes it's Flappy Bird if that arcade...

03:06:50.000 --> 03:06:56.000
It's like a dollar a game for stupid crossy roads.

03:06:56.000 --> 03:07:01.000
I'm like, you could play that for free at home, but we want the tickets to get garbage.

03:07:01.000 --> 03:07:04.000
Like, it's $10 for that one tootsie roll that you got.

03:07:04.000 --> 03:07:05.000
No thanks.

03:07:05.000 --> 03:07:06.000
Alright.

03:07:06.000 --> 03:07:08.000
Let me get to a question in our chat room, at least.

03:07:08.000 --> 03:07:12.000
SG100Matt says, are you all interested in the Nintendo Game Pass deal?

03:07:12.000 --> 03:07:14.000
Do you think you'll pick up on that Nintendo Game Pass deal?

03:07:14.000 --> 03:07:15.000
Probably not.

03:07:15.000 --> 03:07:16.000
I will.

03:07:16.000 --> 03:07:17.000
No, I don't think so.

03:07:17.000 --> 03:07:21.000
I know I'm gonna buy Mario Maker 2, and there'll be something Nintendo...

03:07:21.000 --> 03:07:22.000
If it's good for a year...

03:07:22.000 --> 03:07:26.000
I want to look at the terms, but if it's good for a year, there's gonna be something I'm gonna want later.

03:07:26.000 --> 03:07:28.000
I guess it depends on what they announce.

03:07:28.000 --> 03:07:29.000
But that's...

03:07:29.000 --> 03:07:30.000
I don't know.

03:07:30.000 --> 03:07:31.000
We'll see.

03:07:31.000 --> 03:07:32.000
Maybe.

03:07:32.000 --> 03:07:36.000
Yeah, I guess we do have E3 to kind of see what is gonna come out this year.

03:07:36.000 --> 03:07:37.000
And that's all...

03:07:37.000 --> 03:07:38.000
But that's also digital stuff.

03:07:38.000 --> 03:07:41.000
I mean, I guess I buy everything digitally.

03:07:41.000 --> 03:07:43.000
Yeah, I mean, I do like having...

03:07:43.000 --> 03:07:44.000
You're right.

03:07:44.000 --> 03:07:45.000
It's a digital thing.

03:07:45.000 --> 03:07:50.000
But, you know, so they're basically offering me the $10 I get for selling it used up front.

03:07:50.000 --> 03:07:55.000
I've run out of space in my case to hold all the games we have now, so...

03:07:55.000 --> 03:07:56.000
I need a bigger case.

03:07:56.000 --> 03:08:00.000
Bob Coffee in chat says, I prefer physical, but if I can get eShop cards on the cheap

03:08:00.000 --> 03:08:03.000
and I know it's a game I'll play all the time, I may consider digital.

03:08:03.000 --> 03:08:06.000
SJ100Matt says, probably Marvel Ultimate Alliance 3 and something else.

03:08:06.000 --> 03:08:09.000
So, yeah, that's a Switch thing that's coming before too long.

03:08:09.000 --> 03:08:10.000
Yeah.

03:08:10.000 --> 03:08:11.000
So, yeah, for sure.

03:08:11.000 --> 03:08:12.000
If it's on there, yeah.

03:08:12.000 --> 03:08:15.000
Anyway, can you guys hear Alan cooking in the other room?

03:08:15.000 --> 03:08:16.000
Because the sizzling is loud.

03:08:16.000 --> 03:08:17.000
It smells good.

03:08:17.000 --> 03:08:18.000
Yeah, I think he's making...

03:08:18.000 --> 03:08:19.000
Cat's waiting there for food.

03:08:19.000 --> 03:08:20.000
Yeah, I know.

03:08:20.000 --> 03:08:21.000
The cat is excited.

03:08:21.000 --> 03:08:22.000
All right.

03:08:22.000 --> 03:08:24.000
Well, anyway, since nobody else is in the green room, I think we'll go ahead and wrap

03:08:24.000 --> 03:08:26.000
up there because we've been running for about three hours now.

03:08:26.000 --> 03:08:28.000
So we do want to bring the show to a close.

03:08:28.000 --> 03:08:29.000
Thank you.

03:08:29.000 --> 03:08:30.000
I don't know why tonight's show is so long.

03:08:30.000 --> 03:08:31.000
It's weird.

03:08:31.000 --> 03:08:34.000
Anyway, we do want to thank you guys so much for listening to our show tonight and tuning

03:08:34.000 --> 03:08:35.000
in and participating.

03:08:35.000 --> 03:08:36.000
Thank you as always.

03:08:36.000 --> 03:08:40.000
We are the show where every gamer has a voice, but as we say here on air, if you tell a friend

03:08:40.000 --> 03:08:42.000
or two about the show, help us spread the word.

03:08:42.000 --> 03:08:46.000
It gets more voices here and more folks participating with us and more people to join in on the

03:08:46.000 --> 03:08:47.000
fun.

03:08:47.000 --> 03:08:48.000
So that's it.

03:08:48.000 --> 03:08:52.000
We will be back in two weeks to see you again.

03:08:52.000 --> 03:08:55.000
We will not be here next Sunday, but please come out for Bobby Blackwolf.

03:08:55.000 --> 03:08:56.000
He'll still be here.

03:08:56.000 --> 03:08:58.000
And it sounds like Loki might be doing something afterwards.

03:08:58.000 --> 03:08:59.000
I may.

03:08:59.000 --> 03:09:00.000
Yeah, we'll see.

03:09:00.000 --> 03:09:01.000
You might be able to get your fix if you're around on Sunday.

03:09:01.000 --> 03:09:03.000
I want to do something fun and special.

03:09:03.000 --> 03:09:06.000
It's probably just going to be something new.

03:09:06.000 --> 03:09:08.000
I think even DDR they'd be down.

03:09:08.000 --> 03:09:09.000
Probably just DDR.

03:09:09.000 --> 03:09:10.000
Don't sell yourself short.

03:09:10.000 --> 03:09:11.000
It's not just DDR.

03:09:11.000 --> 03:09:12.000
It's Loki DDR.

03:09:12.000 --> 03:09:13.000
Yes.

03:09:13.000 --> 03:09:14.000
Yeah.

03:09:14.000 --> 03:09:15.000
I haven't played in a few weeks.

03:09:15.000 --> 03:09:17.000
I've been like busy with other things, but I will try.

03:09:17.000 --> 03:09:20.000
I want to get back into all that stuff again.

03:09:20.000 --> 03:09:21.000
Fair enough.

03:09:21.000 --> 03:09:22.000
All right.

03:09:22.000 --> 03:09:24.000
So let's get everybody's final thought.

03:09:24.000 --> 03:09:26.000
Dar Sakura, have a great time at DragCon.

03:09:26.000 --> 03:09:28.000
I will have a great time in Chicago.

03:09:28.000 --> 03:09:29.000
I will.

03:09:29.000 --> 03:09:30.000
Bring me back chocolate.

03:09:30.000 --> 03:09:31.000
Oh, you want your chocolates?

03:09:31.000 --> 03:09:32.000
I want my chocolates.

03:09:32.000 --> 03:09:33.000
All right.

03:09:33.000 --> 03:09:34.000
We'll see what we can do.

03:09:34.000 --> 03:09:35.000
Your chocolates are expensive, but...

03:09:35.000 --> 03:09:39.000
Well, I'll see if I can get you a shade button if they're selling them this year.

03:09:39.000 --> 03:09:40.000
Okay.

03:09:40.000 --> 03:09:41.000
We'll make a trade.

03:09:41.000 --> 03:09:42.000
Okay.

03:09:42.000 --> 03:09:43.000
All right.

03:09:43.000 --> 03:09:45.000
Any final thoughts for our listeners?

03:09:45.000 --> 03:09:48.000
I think I'm going to stop for something on the way home.

03:09:48.000 --> 03:09:49.000
For reasons.

03:09:49.000 --> 03:09:50.000
For reasons.

03:09:50.000 --> 03:09:51.000
For reasons.

03:09:51.000 --> 03:09:52.000
Also, I...

03:09:52.000 --> 03:09:53.000
Cheers.

03:09:53.000 --> 03:09:54.000
Or whatever.

03:09:54.000 --> 03:09:55.000
All right.

03:09:55.000 --> 03:09:59.000
My final thought for the night is go enlightened in Chicago.

03:09:59.000 --> 03:10:00.000
Come on, team.

03:10:00.000 --> 03:10:02.000
We can do it.

03:10:02.000 --> 03:10:03.000
Loki, your final thought tonight?

03:10:03.000 --> 03:10:07.000
My final thought is I can't wait to be disappointed by Game of Thrones.

03:10:07.000 --> 03:10:10.000
It could be over and I'll have to watch it again.

03:10:10.000 --> 03:10:11.000
Sounds great.

03:10:11.000 --> 03:10:13.000
Until your wife finds something else to watch, right?

03:10:13.000 --> 03:10:14.000
All right.

03:10:14.000 --> 03:10:15.000
Oh, she's already going to find something.

03:10:15.000 --> 03:10:16.000
Right.

03:10:16.000 --> 03:10:18.000
That's going to do it for another episode here of Orange Launch Radio.

03:10:18.000 --> 03:10:21.000
Thank you again for tuning in and listening to our whole show this week.

03:10:21.000 --> 03:10:22.000
We really appreciate it.

03:10:22.000 --> 03:10:24.000

03:10:24.000 --> 03:10:26.000

And again, we'll see you in a couple weeks.

03:10:28.000 --> 03:10:29.000
Happy gaming.

03:10:29.000 --> 03:10:30.000
Have fun.

03:10:30.000 --> 03:10:31.000
Catch up on your backlog.

03:10:31.000 --> 03:10:34.000
But overall, don't be rude to people online.

03:10:34.000 --> 03:10:35.000
That's not nice.

03:10:35.000 --> 03:10:36.000
Take care, everybody.

03:10:36.000 --> 03:10:37.000
See ya.

03:10:37.000 --> 03:10:41.000
