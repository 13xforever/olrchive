Orange Lounge Radio

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
This week, Microsoft defines some tolerable speech and MOBAs punish intolerable cheaters.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
If social issues are getting to be too much, why not use your Nintendo Switch to write a program instead?

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,000
These are just some of the stories we'll discuss tonight, starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Orange Lounge Radio

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Hello, my friends out there on the internet. Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:47,000
It is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight with episode number 775 for this May the 5th of 2019.

9
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:53,000
My name is Rob Roberts joining studio by the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

10
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Well, you're going to have to do something special for 777.

11
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I know. Well, you know, there was a there was a Bomani song because our show is rooted in, you know, music gaming culture.

12
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
There's a Bomani song called 777. And I think the plan was always, oh, we're just going to play that song.

13
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
But now it's holy. Well, and now we can't.

14
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
So we might have to like record ourselves playing it and guitar freaks somehow and then like play that.

15
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I don't know. I don't know what you do or we do a Vegas themed thing.

16
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I don't know. We make it extra sinful.

17
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Golden casino night. Hello, Techmaster Loki, by the way. Hello, I'm here.

18
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
The classic game of the week is Vegas Stakes by who did that?

19
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Was that how for Super Nintendo? I think it was the people that went on to make Smash Brothers all those years later.

20
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
So that should be another character like, you know, one of the slot machines,

21
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
the Vegas dude, the girl that comes up to try to loan you money or try to convince you to loan her money.

22
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
And sometimes they pay you back and sometimes they run away with it.

23
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
We'll just fight the Vegas showgirl and proteus over and over and over and over.

24
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I hope people know what I'm talking about in that game, by the way.

25
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
It was kind of a niche, like Super Nintendo game, but I thought it was awesome.

26
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Anyway. OK, good. I'm not alone.

27
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Looking in our chat room over at twitch.tv slash vog network,

28
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
where we do tape live every Sunday night at the voice keeps network vog

29
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
network dot com right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

30
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern. OK, thank you.

31
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Vid Power says, yay, Vegas. I think that's just because the power is in Vegas.

32
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
The break man, though, says, oh, shit, I love that game.

33
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
And Bobby Blackwell says, I enjoyed Vegas Stakes. There you go.

34
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Hopefully, by the way, if you're listening to last week's show,

35
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
you might have heard that we had some live audio issues going on,

36
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
which, you know, say lovey things are going to happen.

37
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
That's the year that that's why you all turn out for a live show.

38
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
And we put it out on the podcast feed warts and all the way that we recorded it.

39
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
So we had some mic issues. So hopefully you guys are going to find that those are gone tonight

40
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
because Dark Soccer and myself have some brand new microphones.

41
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
So we went out on a shopping adventure earlier this week and picked up some microphones.

42
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
They probably look different on stream as well.

43
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
So, you know, the other ones that we had before, they were great.

44
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,000
They were hand me downs, though, from pod culture, which, you know, of course, we super appreciate that.

45
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
But the reality is he had already used them for some time. Then we use them.

46
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
We used them up. I mean, gosh, we were in the apartment when we started using those.

47
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
That was like five years ago. So I think those mics were just on their last legs,

48
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:15,000
except Techmaster Loki still has the last of those microphones because these microphones,

49
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I guess these microphones are 100.

50
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
They were worried I'm going to break them day one.

51
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
These microphones are one hundred dollars a pop. So it was kind of.

52
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
To be honest, not a lot in the scope of mics.

53
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Yeah, no, honestly, we we were looking at some, you know, pretty high end mics.

54
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
So but these I think are going to work for what we're going to do.

55
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
And it was just one of those. All right. Well, maybe we can spend two hundred dollars, but three.

56
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Let's just let's hold off. So we're going to make sure these are good.

57
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
We don't have any problems. And then we'll upgrade. And I went lusting after other mics.

58
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Yeah, you were looking at the fancy like like Lana Del Rey singing a sultry song into an old fashioned radio type of mic.

59
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
You're like, I want to just live stream with it. Well, that's actually kind of what I'm thinking of doing,

60
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,000
because Dan and I have been working on the live stream set up, but my office is an absolute wreck.

61
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,000
And that and I have plans to do a podcast.

62
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I'll just go ahead and say that plans to do a podcast as a sister.

63
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:16,000
One of the sisters of perpetual indulgence to kind of expand the ministry and spread love and positivity in a very geeky, draggy kind of way.

64
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Love and positivity. This is gamer culture. Fuck that bitch. Get good.

65
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I'll show you good. I'll be so fucking good. I'm going to spread so much goddamn love.

66
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Fuck y'all. Love everybody. Damn it. Stop being a shit.

67
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
That's going to be my podcast is like. All right.

68
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Let's get into things that gamers need to love a little bit. Maybe. I don't know.

69
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I want to start this week's show with our kickoff topic before we get into our gaming weeks.

70
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Always like to bring up one topic to kind of start us off tonight. And this is one I think a lot of people are talking about this week.

71
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Right. So the Sonic the Hedgehog movie trailer came out this week and it was everything we would hope that it would have been.

72
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:02,000
It got a reaction. Well, I don't know. Loki like you didn't seem so bothered by it.

73
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Tell it. Oh, it was good. I knew it was going to be terrible. Yeah. And so all I cared about was Jim Carrey.

74
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Jim Carrey was awesome. I'm sold. I'll see it even if it's garbage.

75
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:20,000
OK. For those that don't know, Loki's name does not come from Loki Marvel or like some of the other uses.

76
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,000
It comes from Loki mask like the mask with Jim Carrey, which is is that still like your all time favorite movie, you'd say?

77
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Oh, no. I thought it was like one of your. I mean, it's cool. I like the movie, but it's it's old.

78
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:39,000
But so, yeah. Well, and now when I watched the Sonic movie trailer, you know, I was kind of like, all right, this just looks like it's for kids.

79
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:47,000
You know, whatever. Like and I think a really good comparison was made on Twitter for me that like especially when it comes to.

80
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I think the big thing y'all know we're going to talk about is the look of Sonic the Hedgehog. Right.

81
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:59,000
So I'm not everybody took too well to the look. But, you know, I think the first thing I said on Twitter was, well, you know what?

82
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:05,000
It doesn't mean this movie is going to tank just because all the video gamers that grew up with Sonic are on Twitter going, what the hell did they do to Sonic?

83
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Because I'm like, you know what? Like movies that we don't always understand why they're successful do very well.

84
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:15,000
And I was like, they've made how many movies out of those minions, which I think those things are. I don't get it.

85
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I haven't seen a single one and they annoy me.

86
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Granted, yes, the minions are annoying, but the like the actual story in the writing is actually pretty decent.

87
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Like if you just have to like, I don't know, it's all about the 60s, the set pieces.

88
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Well, in a response I got and I think this is from Flocko, I think. Sorry if I'm misappropriating that comment, but I think the reply I got and I thought this was a better comparison is he said he brought up the Smurfs and the Alvin and the Chipmunk movies.

89
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:50,000
And I was like, oh yeah, those Alvin and Chipmunks look terrible, but like they've made three of those movies, at least two, because one of them opened up against like a Marvel movie or something.

90
00:06:50,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Right. But they'll keep making them because it's just like, you know, they're probably cheap to produce and they make money.

91
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,000
It's just like why there's really bad action movies out there too, because they're cheap to produce and they make money.

92
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:15,000
But that doesn't mean you have to make it terribly. And I understand that like, just because we don't like the look of Sonic doesn't mean that, well, it's okay, we're not the target demographic.

93
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:23,000
No, that would be the argument that the story that they are laying out here is kind of dumb and doesn't follow the game.

94
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:29,000
That would be that kind of argument, but the fact that it looks weird is a problem.

95
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:39,000
But it could be the fact that like, okay, if all these people that had a say on the creative direction of Sonic, if all these people were saying, this may not be a good idea.

96
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Does that leave concerns about maybe the script isn't a good idea? I don't know. I mean, we're all, a lot of us are making snap decisions based on the trailer.

97
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:53,000
You know, we don't know what the movie story or anything's going to be. And I guess when I watched the trailer, I was like, oh, they're making another Jim Carrey movie from the 1990s.

98
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
And I'm down to bet.

99
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Actually, that's kind of awesome. I'm all for Jim Carrey having a 90s movie.

100
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I'm fine with it being a terrible movie, though. And let's be honest, there are some movies that have really good comedians in it, but they are probably pretty terrible.

101
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:21,000
There was one, I don't even remember, I think there was another one with Jim Carrey, actually, with penguins or something like that, that there was something to that effect.

102
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I don't think I've seen that one. And then there was one I know, the Smurfs movies actually have Neil Patrick Harris.

103
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I'm like, I almost want to see it just because of that, but I never did see those.

104
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Looking in chat, DJ Rama S says, this movie may not be targeted at us, but for God's sake, Sonic should look damn near like his anime and gaming counterpart.

105
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Why not, though? Why not try to make it appeal to as many people as possible?

106
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:51,000
That's just an excuse of saying, well, I'm sorry, we just didn't try that hard because we're only aiming at kids and kids don't give a shit.

107
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:58,000
That's a terrible argument. That's just like, well, we wanted to pay the right, you know, that'd be like, imagine a Mario movie.

108
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:10,000
OK, well, we can imagine a Mario movie that came out. Let's imagine a Mario movie outside of the 90s that came out where they're just like, eh, we don't fucking care because it's for kids, you know, and they just half-assed it.

109
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I will say this. There was a Super Mario Brothers anime that came out that was so freaking weird.

110
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Dan and I sat and watched it and it's like, why does this it had like nothing to do with any of the current canon.

111
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:30,000
It was also weird, like having to rescue Peach's like boyfriend or something and weirdness. But weird Mario has been done before.

112
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
And there is a Mario movie coming out, a new one.

113
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Yeah, by Illumination.

114
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Honestly, by the Despicable Me people.

115
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I got to seriously, I know if they have Charles Martinet, you need to seriously sit down and watch those movies.

116
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:48,000
They're not that bad. They're actually pretty entertaining to watch.

117
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:58,000
So like I have no problem with them doing a Mario movie. I think they'd be a great studio to do Mario movie because like anything Illumination has done has actually been pretty good.

118
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Even like a dog's was a life of pets or something like that. That's actually a pretty decent movie.

119
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Well, let me bring it back because I think many of you, I'm sure many of you that bother to watch a Twitch gaming show probably keep some sort of pulse on the gaming news and so forth that's going out there on Twitter and so forth.

120
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:29,000
So I think you all know kind of the punch line that ends this is that because of all of that kind of negative reception that ended up happening on social media, on Twitter and Facebook and everything and just the memes, the redoing of Sonic and so forth.

121
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:38,000
The director of the movie, Jeff Fowler, who is foul town on Twitter. I actually think that's kind of a funny Twitter handle handle foul town over on Twitter said thank you for the sport and the criticism.

122
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:48,000
The message is loud and clear. You aren't happy with the design and you want changes. It's going to happen. Everyone at Paramount and Sega are fully committed to making this character the best he can be.

123
00:10:48,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Hashtag Sonic movie, hashtag gotta fix fast, which I thought was funny. Now, I do want to say every other article you've seen about they have to go back and redo this before the release date.

124
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:07,000
They have so much they're doing that. This is this this tweet, this 280 character tweet is what's been said on the subject.

125
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Every other story, every other click article you saw on Facebook, every other thing you read about how they have to go back and fix the Sonic movie.

126
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I'm using my little quotey fingers. Every single one of those articles is based on this 200 character tweet. So I mean we can sit here and read between the lines too.

127
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:32,000
But we don't know yet if this means release date pushback. We're assuming no. We don't know if this means ironically following up on crunch time after last week's show.

128
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,000
If this means it's going to be crunch time for animators and so forth. I hope not.

129
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:45,000
It's probably it would be crunch time for rendering is what I would think. But they've they can still film their principal photography stuff and then add it in later.

130
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Principal photography has been done since like the end of 2008.

131
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:53,000
So they're not 2008. I'm sorry 2018. I'm sorry.

132
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:58,000
That's why we're getting 90s Jim Carrey. They filmed it in the 90s.

133
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,000
They actually filmed it in the 90s. It's authentic.

134
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:09,000
You know what I meant. I'm sorry. We couldn't we couldn't we couldn't realize Sonic until the technology was there.

135
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:17,000
They filmed it last year and he made dinosaurs come to life with Sonic the Hedgehog was an additional challenge. Fuck off.

136
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:23,000
All right. You all know what I meant anyway. So I mean the thing is principal photography is done.

137
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:28,000
James Marsden. Jim Carrey. They've all moved on to other things. I don't know what they've moved on to these other things.

138
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
So I don't think I mean it is customary to maybe do reshoots here and there.

139
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:38,000
But at the same time if they're if they're fixing this rendering character that was not part of the principal photography now anyway.

140
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I mean it doesn't seem like they need to actually do reshoots but I'm not a Hollywood magician.

141
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Like who who likes. I want to know who okayed this. Who said. Yeah that's good.

142
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I mean like who. No one's like that doesn't really look like it should.

143
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Something's wrong. Focus groups focus groups. I know you're going to you're going to look at me and make fun of me because I'm saying that.

144
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:09,000
No I understand. I'm just answering the question that's presented. Who told them they could do that. Focus groups did.

145
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:19,000
I'm not saying these focus groups knew dick about Sonic the Hedgehog or anything but to be fair in Hollywood they're not necessarily wanting to just attract gamers.

146
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:26,000
They want to build something that they can get all sorts of families on and that they can sell toys at the end of the day.

147
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:34,000
But it isn't even about selling video games about selling toys. But why would making Sonic look more like the character from the game detract from Sonic.

148
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:42,000
That's why I don't understand like why making it look accurate would detract from people wanting to see the movie.

149
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:49,000
I don't ever. That's never been. Sorry. This was better. So that's why it did work. Like it doesn't make any sense. Here's the thing.

150
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Like I'm not I'm not going to like disagree that he looks bad. He didn't. He doesn't look great but I'm not sure what fixing him at this point is going to do like if the movie is bad.

151
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:07,000
You guys it's going to be bad no matter what I want it to be if it's going to be bad. I want it to be really bad because I think Sonic as it is now.

152
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I think if we just kept everything as it is now with the potential to be like so bad it's good type category like I kind of want to go there.

153
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:25,000
But now it's going to be like better and stuff and I guess that's fine. But Tiger Claw on chat says actually an article on I.G.M. back in December.

154
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:32,000
The producer Tim Miller did say that Sega was not happy with the eyes but they went with what we saw because they didn't want Sonic to look like a Pixar character.

155
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Bobby Blackwell fired up in our chat saying the focus groups probably weren't given the game as a reference.

156
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Yeah I also would like to know why. Why was it such a big deal that oh damn we don't want our animation to look like this really.

157
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Well you know this highly esteemed animation company. God forbid we make it look good.

158
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:58,000
I think there's a fear looking forward that then all the reviews would say that it's a Pixar knockoff or something which I'm not.

159
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Again Loki I'm just answering the I put out there I'm not saying I necessarily agree with these things but I that's probably why they did that.

160
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:12,000
And but I think we all sit here and know but everybody knows Sonic the Hedgehog goes back before.

161
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Was Pixar a thing in ninety one. What was the first Toy Story movie. Ninety four.

162
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:23,000
So some predates. We'll say Pixar's legacy. If nothing else we know that Sonic predates.

163
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:34,000
It just sounds like it. It sounds like they just happened. I don't know. Here's the other some I am sure someone worked really hard on it but.

164
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Yeah. Here's other kind of just interesting things I want to put out there about this whole debacle.

165
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:46,000
One of them is the fact that you know whether the news be good or whether the news be bad.

166
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,000
I am hearing more about this movie than any other movie that's coming out.

167
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Oh that's because Detective Pikachu comes out this week and I'm sure it'll be just all how amazing that is.

168
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Somebody was trying to tell me like what movies were opening the same weekend as Sonic and they were like oh there's a sequel to The Shining coming out.

169
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
There's some new Emmerich movie and I'm like I'm like they're making.

170
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Why. Who's first. Who's making a sequel to The Shining and why.

171
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:19,000
The second like I'm just like I I'm not hearing about any of these other movies and I know you know but not nothing that's being said is any good.

172
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Since when was bad publicity. Now I roll it a roll in Emmerich Sonic movie I'm down at that.

173
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:33,000
I was going to say a roll in Emmerich movie. I'm like you want to talk about a movie we know is going to be bad.

174
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Come on. Roll in Emmerich movies are like Independence Day. The day after tomorrow when they're running from temperature is that.

175
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Independence Day was good. Everything after Independence Day was bad.

176
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Independence Day is a perfect example a perfect example of a movie that's bad to the level that it's good.

177
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Yes yes there was a lot of like hold your disbelief type things like yes that's.

178
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Hold on to your butts. No wait that was the Jurassic Park but another movie that's kind of it's kind of bad but it's good.

179
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Oh no it's gone. Yeah Jurassic Park has gone that way too. But yeah I mean I remember I didn't watch the last one that he did but I watched 2012.

180
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:18,000
And like there's only so many times that a plane can take off from a runway when the earthquake is destroying the road.

181
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,000
It happened three fucking times in the movie three times.

182
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:28,000
I kind of agree. Whereas I'm I'm appreciative of this director seems to be wanting to listen to the feedback and all that stuff.

183
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I kind of want to see what the Emmerich Sonic movie would look like.

184
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:37,000
A character that can literally outrun temperature I think would be pretty amazing. All right.

185
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:43,000
But anyway let's talk about that fan backlash a little bit because I'm also trying to sit here and think of a time.

186
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:55,000
And I'm sure maybe chatters know because I can't think of any a time that a trailer was so poorly received that they went back and are changing the movie because of it.

187
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
This is kind of a big deal.

188
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:06,000
I'm not sure about a trailer but I know like several movies had like major reshoots like and never ended up working out too well either.

189
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Like what of the Wolverine movie. The original Wolverine movie.

190
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Good old test audiences seeing the original ending of things.

191
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Little Shepherd Horrors.

192
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Because they had the original Plants When ending with the don't feed the plants that was in the stage play.

193
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:28,000
And they went back and it tested so poorly that they went back and did a happy ending.

194
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:34,000
But it's interesting that this is something that has become more and more prevalent in gamer culture.

195
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Like I know we're spending a lot of time talking about a movie that just happens to be based on a game.

196
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:44,000
But let's be real. Fan backlashes. This is like the new norm in gaming culture.

197
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
And I'm not completely sure how I feel about it.

198
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Obviously the most well known circumstance of this would be Mass Effect 3's original ending.

199
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
And Jamie I know that's a game near and dear to your heart as well.

200
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
I liked the new endings.

201
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:03,000
It's interesting because there's a part of me that's like let the art just be the art and let it be.

202
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:08,000
And when I saw the original endings, because I did beat the game originally before the extended endings.

203
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
I was like it's not that bad.

204
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:18,000
I understand why people were irritated because they felt that the decisions they made were not really reflected in the ending.

205
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:23,000
But at the time I was kind of sitting there going well I feel like there's only so much you could do with it.

206
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
So like you can't wrap up every single story.

207
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Like there's just so many branching paths at this point.

208
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Like I don't know how else you would wrap it up besides an ending that spoiler alert for a video game that's very old at this point.

209
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Either destroys the entire universe or synthesizes or you know the various endings at the end of Mass Effect 3.

210
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:47,000
So it's interesting they went back and did it but I'm kind of with you Jamie.

211
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:53,000
After seeing what they did with those remade endings I was like oh well I like what they did with that.

212
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
I think these are even more impactful now.

213
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:04,000
I know a lot of the hardcore fans hate the synthesis ending because of the unwillingness of merging the technology.

214
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:09,000
However, you can hate that ending all you want. I would still argue it's very well done.

215
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Like just with Trisha Helfer's narration is amazing in that ending.

216
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
I thought it was well done. It's just not the choice that I make.

217
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Sure, sure. You're allowed to have your head canon. That's part of the fun of Mass Effect, right?

218
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Honestly, the only one I choose is the one that has a chance of having my femme shut back.

219
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Yeah. So anyway, but I remember at the time that that all happened I was like, you know.

220
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:37,000
The creators of Final Fantasy 7 should be so happy that the internet did not exist.

221
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:41,000
I mean the internet was there but it was very dial up and prodigy AOL.

222
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:45,000
It wasn't as prevalent in your pocket on your mobile phone as it is today.

223
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Like the creators of Final Fantasy 7 should be so happy that people were not able to make a fuss like they were back then.

224
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Which has me so curious how they're going to do this remake.

225
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Because I don't know if you guys all remember but the ending to Final Fantasy 7 is not great.

226
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Like it's not great. Especially considering all the effort you put into that game and everything.

227
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Like the ending, the payoff. I mean the story in that game doesn't make the most sense as it is.

228
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,000
And the ending just kind of like further complicates that. You know what I mean?

229
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Yeah.

230
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
So it's going to be interesting to see how that all plays out.

231
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Do you think there will be a DLC remake or something? I don't know. A DLC ending?

232
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Anyway, going to chat for some more comments.

233
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Kaijuto says, like I said, gamers don't know what they want.

234
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:36,000
They have to stop bending to everything gamers complain about and just think outside the box and create.

235
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:41,000
SSJ100Matt talking about reshoots saying Back to the Future had to reshoot most of the movie.

236
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Because of Jason Bateman, wasn't it?

237
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,000
It wasn't Jason Bateman. It was somebody else.

238
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,000
I thought it was Jason Bateman.

239
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,000
No, but it was someone along those lines. Like one of those.

240
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Yeah, it was another 80's teen guy.

241
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,000
But yeah, the original audiences didn't respond well.

242
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:02,000
I thought they replaced him. I didn't think they shot the whole movie.

243
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,000
They'd done some significant shooting but they hadn't shot the whole movie.

244
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Which movie?

245
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Back to the Future.

246
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Eric Stoltz.

247
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
That's it.

248
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
It was Eric Stoltz.

249
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Yes, that was it. Eric Stoltz.

250
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Because I kept seeing the movie he was in with Cher in my head and I was like, I know who it is, I know who it is.

251
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,000
And Bobby clarifies it was two weeks, not the whole movie.

252
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
But still a pretty significant amount of time.

253
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Very infamously, Star Trek Voyager shot without Catherine Janeway.

254
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Without Kate Mulgrew. Well actually the character's original name I think was Nicole.

255
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:41,000
I think even the captain had a different name. I think it was Nicole Janeway and it was that French actress Genevieve Bejold.

256
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:47,000
And you can see some of her scenes on the Blu-ray because I've seen it and she's not great.

257
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Like you could kind of tell she didn't really want to be there.

258
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:53,000
So I mean it kind of worked out because Kate Mulgrew is like legendary in that role.

259
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,000
But that's a little different because audiences I don't think had as much to do with that.

260
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:03,000
As maybe this is a circumstance where Hollywood and producers and things like that kind of sat in the boardroom and looked at it and made the right call.

261
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Like when they looked at that footage they said she is not right for this part.

262
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,000
And got the person that they had second in mind, Columbo's wife.

263
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Which ended up being an epic Star Trek captain.

264
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:20,000
So some other just quick reshoot things you may or may not have known about.

265
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Bobby Blackwell pointing out the Matrix Reloaded had to reshoot after Alia died.

266
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:32,000
That's right. Alia was the role that was played by what's his name's daughter ended up doing it.

267
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,000
I thought it was Jada Smith.

268
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,000
No it wasn't that role. It was somebody famous' daughter that ended up doing it.

269
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:45,000
You know the Matrix better. Who was Alia originally supposed to play in the Matrix Reloaded?

270
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,000
It was not Jada Pinkett's character. It was somebody else.

271
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Was it Trinity?

272
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
No it wasn't Trinity.

273
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
No?

274
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Specifically in Reloaded. But anyway.

275
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
I don't remember.

276
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:04,000
No. Queen of the Damned was actually released. Z. That was Z. Z was the character in the movie.

277
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Yeah I don't remember.

278
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:12,000
The interesting thing about Jada Pinkett's role is that she was the star of the game.

279
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,000
And they kind of incorporated that into the movie.

280
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Right? Because the game had Jada Pinkett and that other character.

281
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:23,000
No it wasn't her. It wasn't her as the main character in the game.

282
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
I thought she was like the main character in the game.

283
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,000
No it was. I remember. Maybe it was.

284
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,000
That's it. Nona Gaye. It was Marvin Gaye's daughter. Or granddaughter maybe.

285
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
So anyway.

286
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
I'm trying to remember who the characters were that were in the game.

287
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Thank you Bobby for getting the Wikipedia article faster than I could.

288
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
I don't remember. I played a lot of it though.

289
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Let's see. There was another good reshoot comment here.

290
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:52,000
So Bobby also pointing out about reshoots after the trailer. World War Z had some reshoots after the trailer.

291
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:57,000
S.J. 100 Matt saying didn't Passion of the Christ get toned down after the fact?

292
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Oh it was Niobe. I forgot that she was one of the main characters in that.

293
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:05,000
So with the Passion of the Christ that was an interesting one too.

294
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Because that movie was very violent. But it was very religious.

295
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
It was very anti-Semitic.

296
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Well I'm going to keep it to just the information.

297
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
The trailer is full of spoilers.

298
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Anyway.

299
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Sorry the book was better.

300
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Here's the thing is that they because of the fact that there was many religious people interested in seeing the movie.

301
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Who had concerns about the violence. They released a PG-13 version of the movie.

302
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Which is not the first time they've done that.

303
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Sometimes our movies get a PG-13 version exactly for that reason.

304
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,000
To try to expand who can kind of go see it.

305
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:51,000
Wasn't the original cut of Deadpool supposed to be raunchier?

306
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Deadpool 2 had that holiday version that was PG-13.

307
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
So that's the most recent example of that.

308
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:05,000
I want to say that Aliens had to be toned down a bit too.

309
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Or how about this for Kill Bill volume 1.

310
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:15,000
In Japan the big fight scene in the House of Blue Leaves was in color and longer.

311
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:20,000
And they made it black and white for the US one even though it's like piles of fake blood.

312
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,000
But for some censorship thing to lower the rating.

313
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,000
I have the DVD of the Japanese one.

314
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,000
And honestly the fight's a lot better in color.

315
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:34,000
I think the anime sequence was altered somehow too.

316
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,000
I don't remember it being. I'd have to watch the two of them again.

317
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:41,000
I don't even think it was in the Japanese version. I think it was something Tarantino commented on.

318
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:46,000
I'm irritated. He's kind of come out and said he's not going to end up doing a volume 3 or 4.

319
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Which is sad.

320
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Anyway, we got off track a little bit.

321
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Because I really wanted to talk about fan backlashes.

322
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,000
But let me ask this question. Let me wrap on this question then we'll move on to our gaming weeks.

323
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Because I know we've talked about this for a little bit. Kind of going down memory lane a little bit.

324
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Do you think this fan backlash to Sonic is a good trend or a bad trend?

325
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Because I want to watch how I'm wording this.

326
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Because I don't want you guys to answer the question about what it means for Sonic.

327
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:24,000
I want you guys to answer the question. Is it a good precedent that Hollywood is now willing to change somebody's artistic vision based on the feedback?

328
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:30,000
It's ultimately up to whoever is making the content to make that decision whether they want to change it or not.

329
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,000
I don't think it's a bad trend that people are letting them know what their opinions are.

330
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,000
That's why we have social media. They want to act on it. They can act on it.

331
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
That's independent from the people criticizing it.

332
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:45,000
I don't think under any... we should not expect them to change it just because we complain about it.

333
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,000
But that they're going to do it. That's cool.

334
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,000
I mean that's in their best interest because that's going to get more people interested in it.

335
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:56,000
But that's ultimately their call and I don't think they should blame the backlash on it.

336
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Maybe consider when you're putting out the trailer, make sure that you're showing your best work.

337
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:09,000
And to be fair, that's not to say that this isn't their fault that they're not showing their best work.

338
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:18,000
But there's been several times where I think Sony Pictures or maybe Universal or something sends out trailers without music in them sometimes.

339
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:25,000
They fuck up in that sense where like, dude, I can't believe you did that once and then I can't believe you did that a second time.

340
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:34,000
But yeah, I mean you're marketing a product. You've got to make sure that if something looks weird, people are going to call you out on it.

341
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:39,000
I'm going to comments from chat. Bobby Black Wolf, bad trend. I said the same thing about Mass Effect 3's ending.

342
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Kajudo, bad trend. 100%. Bonds 006. I don't want the retooling. I don't want it to be a trend.

343
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Tiger Claw says, they're not going to completely change Sonic. Mark my word. They have a plan B.

344
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:55,000
Believe it or not, you guys, mark the date and time. I kind of agree with Tiger Claw here.

345
00:28:55,000 --> 00:29:01,000
No tea, no shade. But here's the thing. I don't know so much about the plan B.

346
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:06,000
I don't think they already have rendered footage that exists of something else. They probably have concept art, sure.

347
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:10,000
They have a lot of concepts. But here's the thing. I think the part of his comment where he says,

348
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:16,000
they're not going to change it as much as y'all think they are. I agree with that 100%.

349
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:20,000
I don't think it's going to be this drastic retooling of Sonic. Maybe they'll take his teeth out.

350
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:28,000
One thing to consider is that the animation has been done. All they have to do is reskin the frame.

351
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:36,000
That's all they have to do. You know, maybe tweak animation like on the eyes or something if they do give them the more,

352
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:46,000
you know, game style visage, you know. But the animation is done. The frames are done.

353
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:52,000
There's not going to be a whole lot of tweaking people have to do other than a reskin pretty much.

354
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:59,000
So it's not going to be that thing. But the other thing too is that however it's going to take,

355
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:03,000
they shouldn't rush it. They really need to take their time and do it right.

356
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:10,000
I do agree with that. I think I'm kind of like have these with you because I think when it comes to like maybe the clips of him running

357
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:14,000
or the clips of like I don't think those are necessarily going to need to be changed a lot.

358
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:21,000
But I think because of that, there's a certain structure to Sonic that is just going to have to stay the same.

359
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Like maybe they can change some of the stuff when he's there talking and they're doing some close up shots and things like that.

360
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:32,000
But I just think there's like because I don't think they're gonna have time to go back and do all the, you know, chase sequences or whatever.

361
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:36,000
I think there's a certain frame of his they're going to have to stick with. It's too far gone.

362
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:44,000
They need to make it worse. I want to make him even taller. His legs even like wider or skinnier or whatever.

363
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Just make it worse. I want it to be worse.

364
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,000
As you know, under Matt says it's a new Coke scheme.

365
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Tweak it a little bit and come off like they care about the original subject matter.

366
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Now here's the question. Will the Blu ray have the original Sonic scenes?

367
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:02,000
I want to be able to flip between the two.

368
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,000
All right. Look, I've spent enough time talking about that movie.

369
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Like I said, I can't think of any other movie now that Avengers is coming on and Captain Marvel's coming on.

370
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:15,000
I can't think of any other movie this year that's getting as much talk right now.

371
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,000
So there's that even Detective Pikachu. Now, don't get me wrong.

372
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:22,000
There's a lot of talk about that. And it sounds like it's going to be great.

373
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Some of the early reviews are saying it doesn't suck.

374
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Like I'm not seeing five stars, but I'm seeing as far as video game movies go.

375
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Not bad. I'm seeing it on Saturday. I want to see it too.

376
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:39,000
For sure. I definitely want to see Detective Pikachu, but I'll probably go see the Sonic movie too.

377
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,000
I'm seeing that for sure. Absolutely.

378
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:47,000
Honestly, I just want to see the Jim Carrey 90s stuff. And oh, it's about Sonic the Hedgehog.

379
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:53,000
I fully, I fully support that movie. And if you don't believe me, go look at my Twitter.

380
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:58,000
All right. Anyway, moving on.

381
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Let's get into our gaming weeks and the types of games we have been playing this week.

382
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Maybe, maybe somebody has been playing Sonic the Hedgehog in memory. I don't know.

383
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,000
Dark Saga, we'll start with you. How was your gaming week?

384
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,000
It was uneventful. I've had a very, very busy week.

385
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:18,000
I'm playing lots of Animal Crossing. I got the DJ KK booth and that makes me really happy.

386
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:24,000
I'm still playing Idle Poring. I kind of don't know if I want to keep playing it.

387
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:30,000
Just because, I don't know, I'm not getting any further in the game and I'm just kind of bored with it.

388
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Right now I'm playing it out of this weird sense of obligation.

389
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:42,000
I've been playing Ingress a little bit. Just trying to gather equipment for the event.

390
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:55,000
We got, I don't know if I said it last week, I don't know if we had it by then, but we have a Doctor Who pinball now.

391
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
You did mention it last week.

392
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:03,000
And on camera, if you look in a minute, I'm going to put up one of the plastics that Dan gave me of a Dalek.

393
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:07,000
It's a broken one, but it hangs out in my purse now so I can put it in my cube at work.

394
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:13,000
But I've been playing actually quite a bit more of that because it has one of the best multi-balls ever.

395
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:21,000
But, I mean, really not a whole lot. It's been kind of a work week for me so it's been mostly doing web design stuff.

396
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,000
That's it.

397
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,000
Fair enough. Loki, how about you? How was your gaming week?

398
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:29,000
I didn't play a lot of games this week. I played mainly just Pokemon Go.

399
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:33,000
I've been really bad. I've not played my DDR cabinet in a while.

400
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:42,000
I'm hoping to change that this week. I've been busy with work stuff, so I've actually been doing work at home on top of work at work.

401
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
So, yeah. That's my excuse.

402
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:52,000
This week, though, my wife has gone the entire week on business and stuff, so that means I can stream video games!

403
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:58,000
And so I have to figure out what I'm going to do, but maybe we'll do some of that this week.

404
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:07,000
And then I did work on my game a bit more as well, making very small progress on that.

405
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:19,000
And then I also, because I've been waiting to get something for my PC for a while now, so I finally decided to purchase an Oculus Rift desk.

406
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,000
So I have that pre-ordered now.

407
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:29,000
So you got in on that, because I heard that Bobby went into a little more depth on his show tonight about that.

408
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:33,000
Which is funny, because I think we had so many news stories to talk about. I don't think I actually put it on our show roll.

409
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:41,000
We can talk about it now. That was announced and sold out like that. And you're one of them.

410
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:46,000
Yeah, I didn't realize that they sold out. I just know that they're shipping by the end of the month, is what it says.

411
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:52,000
And that's fine, whatever. I wanted it just because I didn't want to have like...

412
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:56,000
I was going back and forth between that and the Vive, what I wanted.

413
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:04,000
I stuck with the S just because it has that inside-out tracking, so I don't need to set up all the base stations for that.

414
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:10,000
It's just headset and two controllers, and then that's it. That's all you really need to get going.

415
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:17,000
I like how they have it where you can kind of define your room area a little bit, plus they have the pass-through camera on there.

416
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:28,000
So you can see if your kids come up and start asking you questions, you can flip it over and actually see them through the camera, which is kind of cool.

417
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:39,000
So I'm looking forward to that. I know that people have been harping on it because they dropped down the frame rate from 90 hertz to 80 hertz.

418
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:47,000
From what I hear from early reviews, it could be seen two ways. One, it's not a big deal, or two, oh my god, it's a terrible big deal.

419
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:56,000
You should get the $1,000 headset that has 120 hertz. You know what, I'm not spending $1,000 on a goddamn VR headset.

420
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:02,000
I'll spend the same amount of money that I was going to spend on an actual Oculus Rift and get the better Oculus Rift.

421
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:13,000
And I'm just fine with that because I don't know if this laptop can push the 120 hertz in the higher resolution without melting itself.

422
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:24,000
So I'll be fine with just that. Besides, I'm not going to exactly use it for anything super important other than playing Moshpit Simulator and really dumb VR shit.

423
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:28,000
So that's all I'm looking forward to.

424
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
Bring it to the show because I want to check that out.

425
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,000
Definitely.

426
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:37,000
I mean, I'm fortunate enough where I'm sure Bobby will bring the latest and greatest VR to Dragon Con, but I still want to see it when he gets it.

427
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:49,000
Yeah, I mean, and I would be down if I had like a dedicated space to do gaming, I would be down with something more elaborate where I actually have to set up those base stations and stuff, but I don't have that kind of space.

428
00:36:49,000 --> 00:37:02,000
So I'm fine with, you know, something where I can go out into the living room, draw my little box that I'm going to play in and just play without having to, you know, set up a bunch of stuff and mount stuff to the wall and that kind of crap.

429
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,000
So I'm looking forward to that coming in at some point.

430
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:08,000
And yeah, I don't know.

431
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,000
All right, cool.

432
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,000
So that's it.

433
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
All right, the mic gaming week.

434
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,000
I'll start with VR.

435
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,000
I'll piggyback off you guys.

436
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,000
So VR, I've been playing a lot of Beat Saber still on PlayStation 4.

437
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:21,000
PlayStation is the only VR I have right now, but it suits my needs for what I want to play.

438
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
So Beat Saber is great.

439
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
I find that it's just really good exercise.

440
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:32,000
So like on days where I haven't really been able to get to the gym just because, like, especially Sundays are bad because we went to brunch earlier and I have to prep for OLR.

441
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
And the gym is like 20 minutes away.

442
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:38,000
So it's like I, you know, I kind of have to, you know, stay here.

443
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:42,000
So Beat Saber is great for just kind of like getting moving and burning some calories and all that.

444
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,000
And I just love that game.

445
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
Do they have like a calorie tracker type thing in there?

446
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
I have my watch.

447
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,000
My watch does all that stuff.

448
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,000
So yeah.

449
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,000
So I can just feel it.

450
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:53,000
You know, you can just kind of feel it, how worn out you are after playing because I play a lot of stuff on that hard.

451
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:58,000
I've been kind of toning back on expert a little bit just because I keep failing on expert.

452
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:04,000
So I'm like, all right, let me go through and like do everything on hard, you know, and get some trophies that way, which I've been getting more trophies on PS4 and stuff.

453
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,000
And then I'll go back and do the expert because, you know, again, PlayStation 4 is not modded.

454
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:14,000
So I only have like the official sanctioned songs, but with that official pack, there's that additional monster cat.

455
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:19,000
Sorry, I forget the name of the label, but they have that, that DLC pack that was like 10 more songs.

456
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,000
So they're monster cat.

457
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,000
Yeah, there is that.

458
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:25,000
And I think there's a second pack of those that's supposed to be coming at some point.

459
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:32,000
So yeah, I have enough to play in that game and I've been having a good time and then piggybacking on something that Jamie talked about.

460
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:37,000
I also have been playing a little bit of Ingress and Pokemon Go for the two of you out there to play Ingress.

461
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:44,000
I'm trying to get back to level 12 post recursion before the anomaly in Chicago because I got that event in three weeks.

462
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:51,000
I did play a little bit of Ingress too, but it was because my son does the programming class at this place, Code Ninjas.

463
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:57,000
And they're like, so do you know how we would submit to become a Poke stop?

464
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,000
I'm like, well, you got to do it through Ingress.

465
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:01,000
So I submitted their location as an Ingress portal.

466
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
So I was like, why not?

467
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:09,000
You know, I mean, I've seen the, you know, the rabbit over at the gymnastics place to be a Poke stop.

468
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:15,000
So I'm like, or, you know, Ingress portal poke sound like, well, if that can be one, then I don't see why this couldn't be one.

469
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,000
It's a place of education.

470
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,000
Yeah.

471
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
So, yeah, no, it would meet the criteria.

472
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:28,000
You just have to hope it's, you know, not in a area where the other players are going to be like, I don't want that team to have a part of them because I shouldn't really just do what I do.

473
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
And if it doesn't make it through the first time, just keep submitting it.

474
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,000
It'll go through eventually.

475
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:34,000
It's ridiculous, but it works.

476
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,000
Let's see.

477
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
Anyway, what else?

478
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
I've been playing Pokemon Go as well.

479
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:42,000
I haven't done the new raid yet, though, which I think is coming up later in the show.

480
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,000
So I probably shouldn't spoil it too much, but I have not done the new raid yet.

481
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
I need to do that.

482
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:56,000
And then as far as like other stuff, been playing some Final Fantasy 14 and continuing to try to get the max level gear.

483
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:00,000
I even did a stream this week on my personal stream, which I haven't done in a long time.

484
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,000
So I did that.

485
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
And still playing a little Borderlands here and there.

486
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:08,000
So I'm keeping myself pretty busy, but haven't really explored a lot of new games for me right now.

487
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,000
Just kind of relying on my old favorites for the moment.

488
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,000
All right.

489
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Well, we're going to move on.

490
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:23,000
Speaking of not being here and events and things like that, I just want to remind you guys we will not be here in three weeks.

491
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
That's Memorial Day weekend.

492
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:28,000
We're going to have a show live, but I hope you guys will have a fun weekend.

493
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,000
I'm not sure if Bobby's here that weekend or not.

494
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,000
I'll have to see you in chat.

495
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:35,000
But I am going to be off in Chicago.

496
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,000
I'm doing an Ingress thing there.

497
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:41,000
And I have a lot of friends in Chicago, so it's kind of like, you know, the Ingress thing is a convenient excuse to do while I'm there.

498
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
You said Memorial Day weekend?

499
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,000
Yes, Memorial Day weekend.

500
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,000
Okay.

501
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:48,000
And then Dark Sakura is at DragCon, which...

502
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:54,000
And God, it's going to be busy because not only am I going to DragCon, I'm going to San Diego the day after.

503
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
To see a couple.

504
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:02,000
If I had time for it, I'd go even further south and see Agdeft, but I don't have a passport either.

505
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
Oh, yeah, you kind of need one of those.

506
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:09,000
But I'm going to San Diego for one day and then Tuesday I'm going to Disneyland.

507
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:17,000
I'm probably not going to do the Harry Potter thing unless I hate myself and want to drive back on Friday and go to work Saturday.

508
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:20,000
Yeah, I would be full of self-hatred.

509
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,000
That'd be a lot.

510
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
I'm planning, as it is, I'm driving back up by myself.

511
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
That sounds like it's going to be an action-packed trip, so that'll be fun.

512
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:29,000
It is. It'll be a lot of fun, but I'm going to be way exhausted. I was super exhausted after Easter.

513
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,000
Yeah.

514
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:41,000
But I will see so many sisters and drag queens, and if you are in that area and want to have lunch or something, we'll go to Roscoe's.

515
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
Hit me up on Twitter.

516
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,000
Yeah.

517
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:48,000
I suppose the same could be said for Chicago, but I don't know if I'll do any arcade-y things while I'm there.

518
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,000
Spring me back chocolate.

519
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:52,000
Yeah, I might get out to replay or something again.

520
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:56,000
I can get those bars now, by the way, but those bonbons, holy shit.

521
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,000
Right.

522
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:00,000
Let's get into some gaming news and talk about what's been going on.

523
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:04,000
In the world of gaming this week, there's still a lot of news to cover.

524
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,000
Loki, why don't you start us off?

525
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,000
Yeah, so this is kind of cool.

526
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:20,000
There was this game, A Dark Room, that basically is this text-based role-playing game, and the guy that made it, Amir Rajan,

527
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:33,000
he put that, well, the game was released a couple weeks ago, put that if you connect a USB keyboard to it and hit the title key, it'll actually open up a code editor.

528
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,000
You mean the tilde?

529
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,000
Tilde, yeah.

530
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:38,000
It's a title, like it's a music streaming service.

531
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,000
Sorry, yeah, tilde.

532
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,000
Yes.

533
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:59,000
It'll actually open up a Ruby programming language interpreter and code editor that he put in the hit in the game, which the whole point was, he basically put it that he liked coding and he wanted to create games.

534
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:11,000
Back in the 90s, it was difficult to do that, but now, being that it's more modern, it's easier for people to get into that, and he wanted kids to kind of get into that as well and tinker around.

535
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:22,000
Of course, Nintendo did not agree with that, and they decided to pull the game off the shop because, you know, code editor, running your own code, oh my god, hacks!

536
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:28,000
So that's unfortunate for him that you're not going to be able to do that.

537
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:31,000
I don't think they released a physical version of this, but...

538
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:36,000
I don't think they did, and the bummer is, this is such a huge infraction.

539
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:39,000
It's probably going to make him persona non grata with Nintendo.

540
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:42,000
I don't know if he's going to be able to get his game back or any other game.

541
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:49,000
That's a pretty big deal, but help me understand, the coding that you could do, could you really mess with your Switch with it?

542
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,000
I don't think so.

543
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:54,000
I think it's just kind of like a basic editor type thing, but I don't know.

544
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
Someone's going to find a way around it.

545
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:02,000
Mario Maker is kind of coding. My thing is, you can make games in other games.

546
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:10,000
I guess my brain goes to a little big planet, but I guess there's nothing on the Switch that allows you to freely type things.

547
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:14,000
Maybe they're worried that the door is left open too much on that.

548
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:23,000
Yeah, he said basically, the code editors, all it can do is draw lines, squares, labels, play sounds from the game, and detect button presses.

549
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:26,000
It says you can't even render an image with the damn thing.

550
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:35,000
Yes, if your app is composed completely of labels, squares, and lines, it lets you build an app without having to perform any hacks.

551
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:38,000
Are you able to draw a penis out of dashes and lines?

552
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,000
Yes.

553
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:45,000
Well, that's Nintendo's problem. We cannot have ASCII penis on our system.

554
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
That is foreboding.

555
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,000
There it is.

556
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:52,000
Heaven forbid some of those stages in Super Smash, let me tell you.

557
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:58,000
But heaven forbid somebody be allowed to program their own wiener.

558
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:06,000
But yeah, basically the problem is that he cheated their approval process, and so that's why they didn't like that.

559
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
That's unfortunate.

560
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:12,000
Yeah, I mean, you have to disclose everything that's in there.

561
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:23,000
And that's really the biggest infraction because, for example, this has actually happened to Elder Scrolls Oblivion.

562
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:28,000
They submitted their game for a rating, and you have to disclose everything that's in the game, and they got their rating.

563
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:38,000
But then come to find out, the PC version could be hacked so that you could find OMG, a bear titty on the actual CD.

564
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:48,000
The actual texture was a bear titty, and because they didn't disclose that, when they went for their rating, the game got an adults-only rating.

565
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:51,000
Was it titty, or was it the Southern Hemisphere? Was that the problem?

566
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,000
Which game?

567
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:57,000
Elder Scrolls Oblivion. Remember how it got re-rated, AO, because of textures that were found on the original CD?

568
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:04,000
Okay, fuck it. Grand Theft Auto, Hot Coffee mod. There's another great example.

569
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:11,000
Hot Coffee was not accessible without some type of game genie-esque sort of code or altercation.

570
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:17,000
But because Hot Coffee existed on that disc, it got Grand Theft Auto that AO rating.

571
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
Y'all know that one. That was a big deal.

572
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:26,000
Well, if you're wanting the mess of that Ruby interpreter, he does have it available to mess around with for free.

573
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:30,000
So go to dragonruby.itch.io and you can check it out.

574
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:39,000
Interesting that in spite of all that, he's still kind of like putting it out there for free. That seems bold, we'll say.

575
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:43,000
That seems like what Weird Al did with your Pitiful song.

576
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:49,000
I'm sorry, the toolkit's actually 40 bucks, but you can actually purchase it if you want to.

577
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:52,000
That was the Gaga thing too, wasn't it?

578
00:46:52,000 --> 00:47:01,000
No, he didn't do that. One of Gaga's representatives said that she wanted to hear the whole song first.

579
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:09,000
And then she's like, no, I'm fine with it, you can do it. It was the recording company for James Blunt.

580
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:14,000
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Whatever happened to him, by the way. Yeah, right?

581
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,000
Still can't sing.

582
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:24,000
So, anyway. Oh, Bobby's got a whole article on the Wikipedias about this. Here's the Oblivion thing.

583
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:29,000
So Bobby copied Pasta in chat. What Bethesda had originally disclosed to us is an example.

584
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:35,000
In that section of the game, there's a hanging corpse. What they disclosed to us was a hanging corpse in the dark, pretty far away and without much detail.

585
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:41,000
And yet when you bring a torch up to the hanging corpse in the actual game, you can see that it's very mutilated with lots of blood and bones.

586
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:46,000
That was a very different depiction, far more intense, far more extreme than what had been disclosed to us.

587
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:55,000
So, I mean, the disclosure is important. So whether Nintendo is afraid of ASCII dicks in this editor or not, whatever that issue is,

588
00:47:55,000 --> 00:48:04,000
the problem really is that this is a pretty full-fledged feature that he put in this game and intentionally made it difficult to access that people wouldn't find it.

589
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:13,000
And then was like, you know, it was a problem. He didn't disclose it. And if he had disclosed it, maybe Nintendo could have reviewed it and seen it's not that big a deal.

590
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:18,000
You can't run homebrew on it and maybe would have let it stay. Who knows?

591
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:23,000
So, I kind of doubt they would have let it stay. But we like to think that way, right?

592
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:27,000
We like to think Nintendo is going to be a little more proactive like that. Who knows?

593
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:34,000
Anyway, let's move on. And let's talk about Platinum Games. Y'all like Platinum Games, right?

594
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:39,000
Platinum Games is set to start self-publishing.

595
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:44,000
Platinum is going to be self-publishing their games such as...

596
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:52,000
Well, we don't know exactly what games yet, but we know some examples of games that were kind of one and done were things like The Wonderful 101 and Vanquish.

597
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:57,000
And because Platinum doesn't really publish these themselves, they can't really control if a sequel is going to happen or not.

598
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:02,000
And I'm sure most people, when they think of Platinum and sequels and that whole thing, they think about Bayonetta.

599
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:11,000
And so there was an interview recently with Video Games Chronicle where Atsushi Inaba, who's the head of Platinum, said that they want to self-publish their games.

600
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:16,000
Because quote, what it means is we have a lot of different choices in the way that we want to make games.

601
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:22,000
It's that simple. And quite frankly, in the case of Bayonetta, it took a lot of time and energy to get it to the point where sequels could be made.

602
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:26,000
It wasn't as simple as picking up the phone and asking, hey, can we do this?

603
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:30,000
There were lots of pieces that needed to fall into place and a lot of negotiating that had to occur.

604
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:37,000
It's absolutely the truth that there are cases where you want to do a sequel, but if you don't own the IP, you can't do it.

605
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:44,000
Platinum also has two unannounced games in development, so we don't know if there's any possible sequels are there.

606
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:47,000
Well, I guess not because the IP, they can't bring back something wonderful 101.

607
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:52,000
So there are going to be new IPs most likely and things that are owned by the studio.

608
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,000
Marvelous 102.

609
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:59,000
They're saying we're in the middle of designing, the continued quote here from the studio head,

610
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:02,000
we're in the middle of designing something that has never been done before.

611
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:07,000
I know a lot of people say that, but the game we're working on is truly unlike anything else.

612
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:10,000
This is something that has never been designed before.

613
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:14,000
So from a game design perspective, we're very excited right now.

614
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:17,000
Big words about the whole never seen this before.

615
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
It'll be interesting to see if it's really true.

616
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:23,000
I would also like to know if they were able to do something with Scalebound.

617
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:28,000
Did they maybe change things around in the game so it doesn't look like the project that Microsoft funded

618
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:31,000
and maybe that's something they're going to put out after all?

619
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:32,000
Who knows?

620
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,000
Who knows?

621
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:38,000
You see, this game that we've never attempted before, it's like Bayonetta.

622
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:46,000
But instead of putting guns on our hands and on our feet, this dude is going to have a gun out of his ass.

623
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
Why not? Why not? Let's do it.

624
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:53,000
We're going to call it Wrecked Gun.

625
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
Oh my god, I'm so glad you're not a game designer.

626
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:00,000
Oh darn.

627
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
Bayonetta 3 is still a thing.

628
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:10,000
Hey, remember? Bayonetta 3 got announced a couple years ago.

629
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
And that was the last we heard. Yes!

630
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:16,000
Yeah, remember? Hello? Remember? Bayonetta 3 is the thing that's happening.

631
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,000
And that's all we know.

632
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
It was a very quick announcement trailer.

633
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:21,000
I'm hoping...

634
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:26,000
Well, you can't announce things like four years, like several years ago and then just like all of a sudden...

635
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:27,000
Yeah, you can.

636
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,000
I guess you can.

637
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
Everybody does it, I guess.

638
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
E3 is what? Like the week?

639
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
Here's the thing. So we're gone Memorial Day weekend.

640
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:42,000
I think that week we get back is the night that Bethesda interrupts our show with their press conference because E3 is like underway.

641
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:45,000
So, I mean, E3 is just around the corner.

642
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
So I'm super curious if Bayonetta 3...

643
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:48,000
I should just stay in LA.

644
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
...isn't going to show up. I know, right? You should just go to E3.

645
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:51,000
No, I can't.

646
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:52,000
I know.

647
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:55,000
I'm sorry, but I would rather be at work than go to E3.

648
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:00,000
E3 is work in some ways, depending on who you're representing.

649
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:05,000
No, I'm going to be around so many people for a convention I'm actually interested in, so...

650
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,000
I'll let...

651
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
There's a little salt around here when it comes to E3.

652
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:13,000
No, let them jerk each other off. I don't care.

653
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:21,000
Let them show their game dicks and let everyone else compare them.

654
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:25,000
I'll just wait for it to come out from the comfort of my own home.

655
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
They don't give out good swag anymore.

656
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:31,000
Let them put that on the poster for E3. Let them jerk each other off.

657
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:36,000
That's not on the approved Microsoft list, unfortunately.

658
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:41,000
As long as they've got some good dick jiggle physics. I mean, that's really all people want.

659
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:44,000
Listing! Get sexual threat.

660
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
Can you save that for later in the show? Excuse me.

661
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,000
Oh, no, we gotta...

662
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,000
Are you all paying attention? We have a list.

663
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:54,000
Everything is very... It's up on the screen, even though I haven't been totally right with it.

664
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:57,000
It's a list, and I don't see... Do you see the Microsoft thing up there yet?

665
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
That's me flipping off the list. Sorry, Lucky.

666
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,000
You better get to the next item on the list.

667
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:02,000
I'm very delicate.

668
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
The next item on the list is yours.

669
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:05,000
Yeah, whatever.

670
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
Rocket League! Who likes Rocket League in this room?

671
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:11,000
I think it's cool. I wish I had more time to play more of it.

672
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:18,000
Well, their developer, Psyonix, is, quote, joining the Epic Games family.

673
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:21,000
So Epic Games ruined something else.

674
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:23,000
Not yet.

675
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:24,000
Not yet.

676
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
They're planning to ruin it.

677
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:29,000
Well, the ruination is happening.

678
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:33,000
It's going to be closing in late May or early June.

679
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:36,000
They've released an FAQ about this.

680
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
But they wanted to...

681
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:42,000
I guess they're just acquiring it because Rocket League is good.

682
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:46,000
I mean, maybe? I don't know. They just like ruining things for people.

683
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
Yeah, Rocket League's pretty good.

684
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:53,000
It's an interesting title because Rocket League has esports, conventions.

685
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:57,000
You don't want to just poo-poo right off this game.

686
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:00,000
Rocket League has a huge following behind it.

687
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
I want to say, I hope I'm not misappropriating,

688
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
but I want to say our voiceover guy, Jason,

689
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:08,000
really is into Rocket League and goes to some of these events and things like that.

690
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:12,000
So there's definitely a culture out there that loves this game.

691
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:17,000
Well, at any rate, they want to assure people that nothing will change

692
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:20,000
about the day-to-day enjoyment of their game.

693
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:25,000
I think it's kind of interesting that that wording is used.

694
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:28,000
So basically, in the short term, they say nothing about the game will change.

695
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:32,000
But they're still going to go with its update roadmap

696
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:36,000
and to keep it going for, quote, as long as you'll have us.

697
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:42,000
Psyonix said that they will bring the game to the Epic Games Store

698
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:47,000
and that this is, of course, because the acquisition will allow them to grow the game

699
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
so they couldn't do it on their own.

700
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:52,000
So I don't know.

701
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:55,000
They said nothing's changing, but we'll see.

702
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:58,000
Here's why I think Rocket League does well

703
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:01,000
and why I actually enjoy Rocket League a lot too.

704
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:05,000
Here's why Rocket League, and it's honestly a great land for Epic,

705
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:08,000
whether you are a fan of Epic or not,

706
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
it makes sense why they want to have this game

707
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:13,000
because, as is mentioned in chat over there,

708
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:17,000
SSG100Matt says Rocket League is serious esports, and for sure.

709
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
Here's the thing about Rocket League.

710
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,000
It's a stupidly simple game to explain.

711
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
See this car?

712
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:26,000
Use car to push ball in goal.

713
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:27,000
Car soccer. Two words.

714
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
Yeah, car soccer. Go.

715
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
And that's Rocket League, right?

716
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:34,000
Where is Dota 2?

717
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
Let's explain Dota 2.

718
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
You ready?

719
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:42,000
So you have these lanes, and every lane has some walls and towers,

720
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
and you're trying to catch the thing at the end of the lane,

721
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
and you have these 50 different heroes,

722
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:47,000
and let me explain to you how they're all different,

723
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
and you have this little thing that you can send back to the store.

724
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:52,000
I'm sorry, that sounds really boring.

725
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
Here's the thing, and I'm not knocking Dota.

726
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:57,000
I think Dota is super fun in its own way as well,

727
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:00,000
but I think it also goes to, like,

728
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:04,000
I have a lot of friends that say they really enjoy board games,

729
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:09,000
and when I respond, I love Clue, they get pissed off.

730
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
But here's the thing.

731
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:15,000
Clue is very much a board game,

732
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:18,000
and Clue is a board game you can explain in five minutes.

733
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:19,000
Maybe ten.

734
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:22,000
Clue is a little more complicated than something like Candyland.

735
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:26,000
And everybody has their own house rules for Clue.

736
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:30,000
Like, for example, do you bring the piece to the conservatory

737
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
when you make an accusation,

738
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
or does it get to stay on the square where it's at?

739
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:35,000
Every house plays it differently.

740
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:38,000
Movie rules. You explained it all in the foyer.

741
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:41,000
So, but then, so there's that,

742
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:44,000
but then there's also Axis and Allies.

743
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:47,000
Like, that's the type of board game that if I don't know how to play that,

744
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
I'm not a fucking fan.

745
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
So anyway, my point is,

746
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:55,000
I think part of the reason why Rocket League is so loved

747
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:58,000
and so well in esports

748
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:02,000
is that it's a relatively simple concept when all is said and done.

749
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
It's a Clue. It's a monopoly.

750
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:07,000
It's a very easy concept, and that doesn't make it bad.

751
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:11,000
Those are, Scrabble is a game in every household, almost.

752
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:15,000
Okay? It's, you know, just a very easy type of game.

753
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,000
Bonds006 in chat says,

754
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:20,000
OMG, why I did not get into Dota.

755
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
I think going off my explanation there.

756
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
Kaijuto says,

757
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:27,000
The main reason why people love Rocket League

758
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,000
is because when you learn to fly and make aerials,

759
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:32,000
you feel badass. It's a feel-good game.

760
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
Bobby Blackwolf says,

761
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:37,000
Rocket League is closer to traditional sports

762
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:40,000
than something like Overwatch.

763
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:43,000
That's a good, you know, I know that might sound,

764
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:46,000
but I get it. Like, because, yeah, it's kinda soccer.

765
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
Kinda. Sorta.

766
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:51,000
And then they put new modes in the game that are like, kinda basketball.

767
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,000
Yeah, as 200Matt said,

768
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:56,000
I had friends play a full map game of Axis and Allies,

769
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
so I don't know why I pick on Axis and Allies.

770
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:59,000
It's a fine game.

771
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:02,000
But yeah, one of my friends in high school tried to teach me how to play that game,

772
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:03,000
and I was just like,

773
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,000
And by the way, did you know, like,

774
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000
when I was playing Magic the Gathering,

775
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:10,000
like, for the first year I played Magic the Gathering,

776
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
my friends and I were playing it completely wrong.

777
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
Completely wrong.

778
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:17,000
Like, we didn't understand the mechanics.

779
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,000
And when the computer game came out

780
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
that kinda forced you to play by the officials,

781
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,000
I'm talking the original computer game

782
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:26,000
that came with the giant fucking Magic the Gathering card

783
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:29,000
and all that stuff, like, it's, yeah, it was very enlightening.

784
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:32,000
I had, like, one of the ginormous Lords of the Pit.

785
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:35,000
And we used to use the, what was it, the candelabra

786
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:38,000
that let you, like, shuffle any one card into your deck.

787
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:43,000
We would use that particular card to bring out the giant Lord of the Pit

788
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:46,000
that we could put all of his little pitties on it.

789
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
And then, of course, every so often we would randomly, like,

790
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:51,000
mix in a card from another game, like, we'd have Captain Picard.

791
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:54,000
And our house rule is that if Captain Picard came out,

792
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:57,000
everyone loses. Everyone else loses. It's an insta-win.

793
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
Card games. Another good example.

794
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
Card games. Very easy.

795
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
Cards Against Humanity.

796
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
You teach somebody how to play that game in two seconds, right?

797
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
Card game like, um...

798
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
Taboo is another easy one.

799
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
Taboo is pretty, I'm trying to think of a complicated card game.

800
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
I've only ever played it drunk.

801
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
What about, like, playing something like, um...

802
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
A deck-building game.

803
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:19,000
Gin.

804
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:20,000
Dominion.

805
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
Oh, Cribbage.

806
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:23,000
Cribbage.

807
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:26,000
Yeah, that's, I mean, it's not, I mean, Cribbage isn't, like, hard,

808
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
but it definitely takes, like, gets some explanation.

809
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
There's an explanation to it, for sure.

810
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
P-Nuckle. Another good example.

811
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
They're not hard games. They just take a while to explain.

812
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:36,000
Yeah.

813
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
Anyway. Let's move on. We can talk about card games all night,

814
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
but I wanna talk, speaking of esports,

815
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
there's a Scandalos going on, right?

816
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
Yeah, it's, it's not,

817
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
I mean, it's, it's not good,

818
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
but it's not as bad as

819
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
we might allude to, but...

820
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
So, basically, during this, uh,

821
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
the, I guess, uh, World Cup qualifiers

822
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
for Fortnite,

823
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
there was one of the, um,

824
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
pro players, uh,

825
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
DamienXXIFCook.

826
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,000
He was, uh,

827
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
accused of colluding with other players

828
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
to help him rank up.

829
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
So, basically, there's, um,

830
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
video out there of him

831
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
landing next to

832
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
a couple, uh, other players,

833
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
and, basically, the other players allowing him

834
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
to kill them to kinda help

835
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
rank up. And, of course,

836
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
that went viral, and,

837
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
um,

838
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
you know, that's not a good, good face.

839
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
But, on top of that, though,

840
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
apparently, uh,

841
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
there's been other cheaters

842
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
as well. So,

843
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
along with that, um,

844
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
Epic Games actually went and did some

845
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
investigating to see kinda

846
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
what was going on, and there's

847
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
been bans. So, 14-day

848
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
competitive bans on several

849
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
different players, um, including,

850
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
I think, they didn't name

851
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,000
XXIF, but I believe

852
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
that they were

853
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
included as well, and they have been stripped of

854
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
their qualifying spots.

855
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
Because of, um,

856
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
boosting other players.

857
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
The boosting thing's been a problem in Overwatch.

858
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
Yeah, so.

859
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
Boy.

860
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
You know, it's kinda hard when you have

861
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
these online games that you're trying to do qualifiers

862
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,000
in without, like, any really big oversight.

863
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
It's also an interesting thing that doesn't really

864
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
I'm trying to think, is there an equivalent in, like,

865
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
football, basketball,

866
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
as we know it, like, you know, traditional sports,

867
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
if you will, is there an equivalent of boosting?

868
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
I don't think there really is. No, it would be like throwing

869
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
a game, but, like,

870
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
Yeah, I guess throwing a game is very bad, but, like,

871
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
you know, if you go and

872
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
mentor a camp or something,

873
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
you're not exactly breaking the rules, you know,

874
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
or, I guess, can you wear a disguise

875
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
and go play a minor league game? I guess that

876
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
would be, like, the closest thing I can think of.

877
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
Like, you're wearing a fake mustache

878
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
and playing in a minor league game.

879
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
Yeah, that's, that's, that's a little different.

880
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
This is more of, like, I think, yeah, just,

881
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
just, like, oh, hey, you know,

882
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
we really want those kings

883
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
to make it to the playoffs, so let's just all

884
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
kind of drop the ball and let them throw in

885
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
those three-pointers, that type of thing.

886
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
Oh, kings are never gonna make the playoffs. Exactly.

887
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
That's the only way they would ever win.

888
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
But no one's ever gonna do that because

889
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
they all wanna win, and, yeah.

890
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
Alright, well, let's talk about something,

891
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
uh, highly interactive. That's right here,

892
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
Twitch, Twitch TV, where, uh, you can

893
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,000
interact with our show when we're live. Of course,

894
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
we love our podcast folks as well, and they,

895
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,000
you always can interact with us, uh, delayed

896
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
a little bit over on Twitter, twitter.com

897
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
slash o-l-r, and you can also do that, uh,

898
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
maybe through Facebook or through our email bag.

899
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000
Participate at orangelandtrader.com.

900
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
But, uh, when you're broadcasting on Twitch,

901
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
you can interact in real time, and more and more

902
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
games are starting to think about how can we

903
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,000
kind of incorporate that into our game,

904
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
and Borderlands 3.

905
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
Which looks amazing, by the way. Yeah, they had a big

906
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
reveal this week, right? They had the gameplay reveal,

907
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,000
and I'm totally in day one.

908
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
That looks all sorts of awesome.

909
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,000
I have to admit, I did not watch the gameplay reveal

910
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
yet, because I'm still making my way through the other

911
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
ga- I mean, I know a gameplay reveal's not gonna

912
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,000
give anything away, but I just, you know, I'm just focused

913
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
on trying to get through the original games,

914
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
uh, before this comes out.

915
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
But, uh, yeah, I'm excited for

916
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
folks that are into this series, and now I see

917
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
why people enjoy Borderlands. I get it.

918
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
Um, anyhow, uh, so

919
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
during the, uh, Borderlands 3

920
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,000
reveal, they talked about an extension called

921
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
the EchoCast. So if you

922
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
use this extension, apparently,

923
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
um, you can- the viewers can

924
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
look at the streamer's loadouts,

925
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
look at what's in the backpacks.

926
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
So through the extension, I guess you could

927
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
probably click on something on the view window, and even if I'm

928
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,000
not looking at my inventory at this minute, you can look at

929
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
my inventory on your- your

930
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
Twitch screen, because that's how the extensions

931
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
kind of work, right? I don't know if we use any

932
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
extensions on, um, VOG Network's

933
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
channel. I don't- Bobby would have to

934
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
refresh my memory. I don't think so,

935
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,000
because we're not really playing games here.

936
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
Um, but a lot of the more traditional

937
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
Twitch extensions, there's things like,

938
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
um, you know, you can interact with the streamer,

939
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
maybe play noises, or, you know, sometimes you can

940
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
affect what's going on in the game. My favorites

941
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
are, like, I was watching the other- Mixer does this a lot,

942
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,000
too. I watched the other day, there's a guy

943
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,000
that, um, he has, like, a currency

944
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
that they can earn by playing different

945
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
games in chat, and then they spend that

946
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,000
currency on putting cheats in Grand Theft Auto,

947
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,000
so they can put cheats in

948
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,000
to hurt or, you know, help the

949
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,000
player, and it's all sorts of

950
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
craziness. Yeah, this, uh, Tomb Raider

951
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
reboot had something like that in, like, the

952
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
multiplayer or something, where, like, that your

953
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
Twitch chat could affect what's going on.

954
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
So, I mean, we've heard about games, you know,

955
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
kind of interacting with Twitch, but anyway, uh, also

956
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
there will be special loot chests throughout

957
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
the game. If a streamer opens them,

958
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
you can opt into a challenge called

959
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
the Rare Chest Event. This

960
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
means the viewer would get a copy

961
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
of whatever the streamer

962
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
gets. It's kind of, I like

963
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
that, that's kind of interesting. It would be a

964
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
shift code, I guess, that would be given out, and

965
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,000
scaled to the viewer's level when you redeem it in

966
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
your own game. So, interesting.

967
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
Um, the gameplay reveal,

968
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,000
I guess the EchoCast extension was, uh,

969
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
coincided with that, so if you were

970
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
watching the Borderlands 3

971
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
reveal, you kind of get an idea how that works,

972
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,000
which I missed out on, but, uh, did they, did they

973
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
actually have that going during the gameplay? I didn't watch

974
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
it on Twitch, so I don't know. So,

975
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,000
interesting, though. I think that's really cool.

976
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
Um, I like how more games are thinking about

977
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
how can we, like, really embrace this streaming

978
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
thing, and, like, do our own stuff

979
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
with it. I think that's really cool.

980
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
So, uh, yeah.

981
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
S2100Matt says, uh, this opens the door

982
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
for people to judge other people's inventory.

983
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,000
I tend to be a massive hoarder in games like this.

984
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
I would imagine that you could turn it off,

985
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
I suppose, if you wanted to. Maybe.

986
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
I don't know. Anyway, let's move on.

987
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
DarkSakura, what do you have for us? Well,

988
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
there is a video game hall of fame.

989
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
Of course, we know about this one, among

990
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
other ones, but we're talking about the

991
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
nice, legit one.

992
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
You know what I mean by legit, right?

993
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
Uh, meaning

994
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
non-pirated, I guess.

995
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
Well, no, meaning that it's actually

996
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
a pretty big one.

997
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
So, uh, this year,

998
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
the, um, the,

999
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
uh, it's the Strong's

1000
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
World Video Game Hall of Fame.

1001
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
So, uh,

1002
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
the, uh, games that are being included

1003
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
are, duh duh duh,

1004
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,000
uh, Mortal Kombat,

1005
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
which, it's got a deserving

1006
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
place. Um, Super Mario Kart,

1007
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
uh, also,

1008
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
um, Colossal

1009
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
Cave Adventure, and get this,

1010
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
Windows Solitaire.

1011
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
Then again, I get that.

1012
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,000
How much of us wasted so much time

1013
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,000
on that? Seriously? Windows Solitaire

1014
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
was a game for filthy casuals.

1015
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
Um, filthy casuals, really?

1016
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,000
Even, you know what I mean. Yeah.

1017
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
It's a joke. But, and all

1018
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
joking aside, um, Solitaire, and I

1019
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,000
feel like this just came up on the show a few weeks ago,

1020
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
Solitaire's a great game for developing motor skills.

1021
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,000
Like, if you are, you know, maybe

1022
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,000
older and haven't used computers an awful lot,

1023
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,000
Solitaire is a great way to learn.

1024
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
I reckon. It's just,

1025
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
it's never... I've used that in my professional life.

1026
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
That's all why I kind of bring that up.

1027
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
Somebody who's a little less comfortable with computers, I'll say,

1028
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
have you played Solitaire at home? You should think about it.

1029
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
Okay. Well, it does

1030
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
get you kind of into the point and click

1031
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
mentality. Yes. You know, which I guess

1032
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,000
for people doing, like, data entry

1033
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
or something, that might be

1034
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
worthwhile. But I just think it's very

1035
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
interesting that it's finally being

1036
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,000
recognized. That instead of just

1037
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,000
being, you know, bloating software

1038
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
for Microsoft Windows,

1039
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
it's a mainstay. On top

1040
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
of that, with this picture, it's got, like, the same

1041
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,000
monitor that Dan and I had when I first moved in

1042
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
with him. This little dinky

1043
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,000
computer monitor. That's pretty funny.

1044
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
Um, you know, but the

1045
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
other thing about Colossal Adventure is that,

1046
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
you know, Colossal Cave Adventure, sorry,

1047
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,000
is that it was also a cassette

1048
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,000
game. So, you know,

1049
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
but the other games that were,

1050
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,000
uh... Sorry,

1051
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
the Colossal Cave Adventure, that's a text adventure game, right?

1052
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
Yeah. That predates Zork.

1053
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
So it's kind of like your text adventure

1054
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
representation, right? Yeah, it's like

1055
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
your intro to all things text.

1056
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000
Can you read? You can play it. I think that was

1057
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
one of the first, yeah. And I think that's why it's

1058
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
noteworthy. But the other thing is

1059
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
that there were some other games that were in the

1060
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
list of finalists, but did not

1061
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
make it, including, those were

1062
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
Candy Crush Saga,

1063
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
Centipede,

1064
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,000
DDR, Half-Life,

1065
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
Myst, NBA 2K, Sid Meier

1066
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,000
Civilization, and Super Smash Brothers

1067
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,000
Melee. Here's the thing. Shouldn't a game

1068
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
have to be out for at least 10 years

1069
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
before we start thinking about the Video Game

1070
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
Hall of Fame? Like, when it comes to Candy Crush.

1071
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
Because I would say a game like Mortal Combat,

1072
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,000
I think if we had evaluated

1073
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
whether it belonged in a Video Game Hall of Fame

1074
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
in 1995, or whatever year that game came

1075
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
out, or even one or two years after it was out,

1076
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,000
I'm not so sure we would think that

1077
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
that game is going to end up in the Hall of Fame someday.

1078
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
Because of how controversial it was. What are my

1079
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
rules for classic game?

1080
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
Yes. But you're not

1081
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
curating this museum, unfortunately.

1082
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
I'll curate a museum. And it's basically

1083
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
going to be Mass Effect

1084
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,000
and Sega games.

1085
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
Which, if you go to the classic

1086
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
game of the week list, is similar to what

1087
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,000
she did. No, I have Compile

1088
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
because of Guardian Legend.

1089
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,000
Okay, sorry. One exception.

1090
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000
Bitch, don't doubt me.

1091
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
Hearts. But anyhow,

1092
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,000
that's cool. And I see in our chat,

1093
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
SD100Matt says, I keep meaning to go to this place.

1094
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
My girlfriend has family in Rochester

1095
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,000
and we're up there often. Hey, if you go,

1096
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,000
take video. Take a ton of it.

1097
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
Bring us a souvenir.

1098
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
I'd be curious. Anyway.

1099
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
And then ship me some Waffle House Grits.

1100
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
Metal Mayhem in chat says, didn't cassette

1101
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,000
games have horrendous accessing and low

1102
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
times? Oh, absolutely.

1103
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
Absolutely, they did. Well, on top of that,

1104
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
I'm sure I've spoken ad nauseam about the problems

1105
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
with the Coleco Atom. That anytime you

1106
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,000
had a power surge, it would erase your cassettes.

1107
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,000
Right. But the thing about it,

1108
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,000
I mean, the cassette was what existed

1109
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,000
before the disc, which existed

1110
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,000
before the CD, which is ironic. The audio

1111
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,000
is also used, kind of, two of those

1112
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,000
forms. To be fair,

1113
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,000
there were 11 inch floppies

1114
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
and 13 inch floppies

1115
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
around the same time that cassette

1116
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
became a viable

1117
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,000
storage media.

1118
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,000
And I think cassette was just

1119
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,000
you know, like, again, there was

1120
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,000
no way to, like, have

1121
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,000
a pre-installed game

1122
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
that you could put on your system

1123
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,000
or what have you without, like, typing

1124
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
it in if it weren't for cassette or disc.

1125
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,000
Yeah. You either programmed

1126
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,000
that shit in BASIC or

1127
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,000
you, I mean, well,

1128
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,000
in computers for production

1129
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,000
at the time, we're still, some of them

1130
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,000
were actually still using Fortran and punch cards.

1131
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,000
So, there you go.

1132
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,000
Yeah. So,

1133
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,000
it is kind of interesting, though, how tapes kind of went to CD

1134
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,000
later on, but anyway. So,

1135
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,000
okay, there you go. Additions to the Video Game Hall of Fame.

1136
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,000
It's a decent selection.

1137
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,000
I mean, when you hear some of the games, they omit it.

1138
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,000
Of course, my fanboy is going, what?

1139
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,000
No Civilization? They couldn't, Mortal

1140
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,000
Combat couldn't wait another year for Civilization? I knew that would make you

1141
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,000
sad. I know, a little bit, but

1142
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,000
I can't, like, look at any of those games

1143
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,000
they picked and say it doesn't deserve it.

1144
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,000
Yeah, they all deserve

1145
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,000
their place in there. They all deserve it in their own way.

1146
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,000
Like, even if you kind of look at Solitaire

1147
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,000
and go, huh? Like, again, you have to look

1148
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,000
at, what did it do for gaming the big

1149
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000
picture as opposed to just gaming for the

1150
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,000
hardcore audience? Seriously, that is exactly

1151
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,000
it. I mean, although, I

1152
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000
must say, the thing that disappoints me

1153
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
is that DDR isn't included.

1154
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,000
Sure. Because DDR, for

1155
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,000
itself, was actually fairly revolutionary

1156
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,000
for genres. Well, it created

1157
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,000
a genre, practically. Well, Beatmania

1158
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,000
really did. DDR is why we're

1159
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,000
here.

1160
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,000
If it were me, I would put Beatmania in before

1161
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,000
DDR, because we wouldn't have DDR without

1162
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,000
Beatmania.

1163
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,000
Or Spiderstomp. Here's the thing, though. Here's what's

1164
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,000
ultimately going to happen, because this is based in

1165
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,000
America, and it's a Murica

1166
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,000
thing. I think DDR

1167
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,000
was more known here than Beatmania.

1168
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,000
Which, to be fair, is Konami's own damn

1169
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,000
fault, because they released it here as Hip-Hop

1170
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
Mania, and it wasn't really the same kind of thing.

1171
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,000
And they did that, I think, after DDR.

1172
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,000
Yeah, and they never tried

1173
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,000
the five key releases here and that stuff

1174
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,000
until way later.

1175
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,000
So, I mean, DDR is what

1176
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,000
people know here. My first exposure was

1177
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,000
BM98. Sure,

1178
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,000
but you also go

1179
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,000
to anime conventions,

1180
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,000
which is not, you know... Well, at the time, I did.

1181
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,000
At the time.

1182
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,000
Alright, well, let's move on, and

1183
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,000
let's get to our next story,

1184
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,000
which is from Loki.

1185
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,000
Alright, so this has

1186
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,000
got me very excited, even though we know

1187
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,000
no details about this yet, and

1188
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,000
there's a good chance that they're going to fuck it up.

1189
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,000
But you're still going to pre-order your ticket.

1190
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,000
Oh, yeah, seriously.

1191
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,000
So Saints Row the Movie is something that's going to be

1192
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,000
worked on, and apparently

1193
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,000
right now, they've

1194
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,000
got a director attached,

1195
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,000
director F. Gary Gray,

1196
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,000
who is, I guess, working

1197
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,000
on, or he had worked on The Fate of the Furious

1198
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,000
and the upcoming Men in Black

1199
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,000
International. And then, of course,

1200
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,000
Greg Russo is going to be

1201
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,000
writing

1202
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,000
the treatment as well, and he's

1203
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,000
rebooting the Mortal Kombat franchise

1204
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,000
in the movie forms.

1205
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,000
And, yeah, so that's

1206
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
about all we know about it right now. I'm assuming

1207
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,000
this is something that's going to be

1208
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,000
coming way later on.

1209
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,000
They've got to have Daniel

1210
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,000
Dae Kim as Gat, because that's really the only

1211
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:58,000
way I'd want to see that.

1212
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,000
And what

1213
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,000
the hell? Let's just put Troy Baker in there

1214
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,000
as well as the

1215
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,000
boss, because that'd be awesome.

1216
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,000
What do you want to see in a Saints Row movie?

1217
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,000
I want to see fucking crazy shit, but being that it's

1218
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,000
The Fate of the Furious, that movie is pretty

1219
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,000
over the top as it was.

1220
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,000
So let's just, like,

1221
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,000
take that. Let's take the

1222
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,000
new Fast and the Furious

1223
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,000
spin-off movie that they have coming out pretty soon.

1224
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,000
Take all of that stuff

1225
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,000
and just say,

1226
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,000
tell the director,

1227
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,000
do whatever the fuck you want.

1228
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,000
Just go as crazy as you want

1229
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,000
and make it... It doesn't even have to be believable.

1230
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,000
Just go fucking nuts, and then that would

1231
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,000
be perfect. Tigerclaw in chat asks,

1232
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,000
will the Saints Row movie

1233
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,000
have the self-awareness and meta-humor?

1234
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,000
If it doesn't,

1235
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,000
I hope they don't make it.

1236
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,000
It needs to, like, seriously.

1237
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,000
I don't think

1238
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,000
they should directly adapt one of the games,

1239
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,000
but Saints Row 3, again, I cannot

1240
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,000
stress this enough. I was laughing

1241
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,000
so hard during the opening moments

1242
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,000
of Saints Row 3. Like, I was

1243
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,000
crying. Like, it's just, like,

1244
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,000
the game is so fucking funny.

1245
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,000
And my character, you know,

1246
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,000
I had, like, a female character that

1247
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,000
was, like, falling through planes

1248
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,000
and stuff like that. Like, the opening is just ridiculous.

1249
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,000
And I'm just like, this game is

1250
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,000
so, so stupid.

1251
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,000
I love it. I love it.

1252
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,000
Yes, I want that.

1253
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,000
I want that, too. So stupid that

1254
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,000
it's amazing. Make that bad

1255
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,000
Sonic movie that Loki wants to see.

1256
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,000
But Saints Row, put

1257
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,000
Jim Carrey in the Saints Row movie.

1258
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,000
Is there a part for him in there?

1259
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,000
Not really, but, um, but yeah,

1260
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,000
just, like, over the top. Like, there's plenty of

1261
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,000
movies that are kind of over the top.

1262
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:40,000
I mean, many in the Fast and the Furious

1263
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:42,000
franchise. I mean, they're just, like, the whole

1264
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,000
Fast and the Furious thing, which is over

1265
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,000
the top. But that, that's

1266
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,000
why it was good, you know?

1267
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,000
I just don't want them to do, like, a cheap

1268
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,000
just, like, this is gonna be kind of, like,

1269
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,000
Fast and the Furious.

1270
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,000
But, I don't know, like,

1271
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,000
Gat is such a great character, it's gonna be hard to

1272
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,000
find some, if they recast him, it's gonna be

1273
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,000
hard to, like, get that character right.

1274
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,000
The boss can be who, that's

1275
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,000
gonna be the hard part, is the boss, because

1276
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,000
who's it gonna be? Because

1277
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,000
it can be pretty much anybody.

1278
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,000
Um, I don't know. Metal Mayhem in

1279
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,000
Chats is a Saints Row movie needs to have a gun,

1280
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,000
dubstep gun and a giant purple

1281
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,000
dildo bat. Honestly, cosigned.

1282
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,000
Like, that might surprise you that I'm saying

1283
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:22,000
that, but those are the things- And Professor

1284
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,000
Genki. Those are the things that make Saints

1285
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,000
Row, like, fucking stupid.

1286
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,000
But, like, in that really funny way.

1287
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,000
You know what I mean? And this is perfect for, like,

1288
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,000
that really stupid action movie

1289
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,000
genre, where it's like, you'll make it,

1290
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,000
it'll be fucking stupid, and it'll make

1291
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:38,000
tons of money, and they'll make more and more,

1292
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,000
and it'll be, whatever.

1293
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,000
Uh, Bonds 006

1294
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,000
says, Saints Row film, a very bad

1295
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,000
over-the-top Deadpool sans Ryan

1296
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,000
Reynolds. Deadpool? Honestly, maybe

1297
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,000
Deadpool is a good thing to

1298
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,000
kinda look at for how to do this. Oh my god.

1299
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,000
Yeah. I'm cosigning

1300
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,000
Ryan Reynolds as the

1301
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,000
boss for the Saints Row movie.

1302
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,000
Hell yes. I don't,

1303
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,000
the man can only do so much, but

1304
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,000
I, that would be amazing

1305
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,000
if he did. Wasn't Ryan Reynolds supposed to be

1306
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,000
doing, like, the Clue movie at some point? I don't know.

1307
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,000
He can do everything. He signed on to all those board game

1308
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,000
movies or something? Whatever happened to that?

1309
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,000
Development hell, I guess.

1310
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,000
But yes, Daniel Dae Kim and Ryan

1311
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,000
Reynolds. They're saying Keith David is the

1312
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,000
narrator. Well, Keith, Keith

1313
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,000
David's supposed, yeah.

1314
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,000
He's just supposed to be Julius, so.

1315
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,000
Uh, SD100Matt says that Hobbs and

1316
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,000
Shaw movie looks ridiculous, I'm concerned. Exactly.

1317
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,000
Keep that level of ridiculousness

1318
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,000
and over-the-top, you know.

1319
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,000
It just, just keep it going. Yeah.

1320
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,000
Alright. Uh, anyhow,

1321
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,000
let's move on. Uh, got another story here

1322
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,000
before we get to our classic game of the week, and this is

1323
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,000
about a classic game of sorts.

1324
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,000
Earthworm Jim has a new game in

1325
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,000
development for the new Intellivision

1326
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,000
Amico, which, of course, as we know,

1327
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,000
is coming out in the year 2020. I still don't like those controllers.

1328
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,000
I get it. Like, I don't like

1329
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,000
them. Yeah. I hope they have

1330
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,000
traditional controllers as well. Yeah.

1331
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,000
I'm sorry to call this out on air, but make sure when you do this, uh,

1332
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,000
it's away from the mic, because remember the new mics are super sensitive,

1333
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,000
so it's picking up the bags. Sorry.

1334
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,000
And I was sitting on the mic.

1335
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,000
Anyway, um, so, uh,

1336
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,000
the new Intellivision, of course, is coming out, uh,

1337
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,000
what, 10.10.2020, and, uh,

1338
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,000
Earthworm Jim hasn't had a game

1339
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,000
since, what, 95? So they're making

1340
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,000
a new one. Oh, no, there was a high, uh,

1341
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,000
there was an HD remake. They did do that.

1342
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,000
Yeah. Yeah, but not as a

1343
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,000
proper sequel. So, uh, the

1344
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,000
original team members are participating

1345
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,000
in this, uh, including Doug

1346
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:28,000
to Naples, which, um,

1347
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,000
he's a character. We'll put it that way. My

1348
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,000
understanding is that, uh, he is

1349
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,000
doing it on a volunteer basis, so if you're

1350
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,000
worried about possibly

1351
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,000
money and all that stuff, it sounds like

1352
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,000
that is, it's gonna be a little easier to

1353
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:42,000
separate the art from the artist in this, this

1354
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,000
particular circumstance because he's volunteering,

1355
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,000
which is kind of interesting,

1356
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,000
um, but cool, I guess.

1357
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,000
And, of course, Tommy Tallarico, he did the music

1358
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,000
and the soundtrack before, uh,

1359
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,000
so, uh, he's gonna be doing that again,

1360
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,000
of course. And what a coinkydink

1361
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,000
that Tommy Tallarico is playing such

1362
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,000
a role as the CEO

1363
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,000
of Intellivision, so it kind

1364
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,000
of makes sense why this game is

1365
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,000
the one that they're bringing back. Um,

1366
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,000
I was interested, though, when

1367
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,000
I saw a lot of the comments on this

1368
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,000
about how, well, looks

1369
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,000
like I'm not playing Earthworm Jim

1370
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,000
because they're putting it on this trash console

1371
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:18,000
and, well, I'm just, uh, fuck

1372
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,000
exclusivity agreements, I'm not gonna play it.

1373
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,000
Well, they don't know what... And I'm just kind of like,

1374
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,000
oh, shut up. Like,

1375
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,000
do y'all know what business is?

1376
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,000
Because if, if the Amico wasn't

1377
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,000
trying to get some exclusives and some games

1378
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,000
that are, like, kind of like must-haves or must-tries,

1379
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,000
then you all would shit on the

1380
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,000
Amico for not having any games worth playing.

1381
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,000
So, like, this kind of goes back

1382
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,000
to the beginning. I just don't know about the controllers, though.

1383
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:42,000
Like, I know, I don't remember,

1384
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,000
you know, the

1385
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,000
ColecoVision too fondly, and I know the Intellivision

1386
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,000
stuff's kind of similar. Um,

1387
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,000
I don't know. I just,

1388
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,000
I have a hard time imagining how that's gonna

1389
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,000
work, but I'm sure it'll make it work.

1390
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,000
Bobby is pointing out you saw a render, but not

1391
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,000
the actual controller, so. Right. There's still time

1392
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,000
for things to change based on fan feedback.

1393
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,000
Perhaps.

1394
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,000
Uh, Metal Mayhem says, so long as the new

1395
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,000
Earthworm Jim is like the first two games, not Earthworm Jim 3D,

1396
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,000
I'll be happy. I think it's a safe

1397
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:10,000
bet to say it's gonna be like the first two games that you remember.

1398
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,000
Yeah, I think that's what they're going for in this

1399
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,000
console. It's supposed to be all 2D stuff, isn't it?

1400
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,000
Uh, yeah, I think so.

1401
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,000
Uh, Dartusuya says, I know Tommy made a

1402
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,000
comment going to bat for him, whatever it's worth,

1403
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:22,000
but I do hope he does a good soundtrack for this game.

1404
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,000
Um, and it's also interesting to point out,

1405
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,000
you know, for, whether you

1406
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,000
hate the exclusiveness or not,

1407
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,000
remember Intellivision has very

1408
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,000
firmly said games will cost

1409
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,000
at most, what, ten bucks? I think it was actually

1410
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,000
under that, it was like eight bucks.

1411
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,000
So that means, I would assume

1412
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,000
Earthworm Jim is going to be no different.

1413
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,000
It's going to be like an eight dollar game.

1414
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,000
So, interesting.

1415
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:46,000
I, I just. Yeah, I'd be curious to see

1416
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,000
what happens when it comes out.

1417
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:50,000
You know, it's, it's interesting to see how

1418
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,000
the Intellivision is coming into its own.

1419
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,000
And I'll be very curious to see more

1420
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,000
moves like this about what, what kind of

1421
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,000
games are they really going to bring to the table

1422
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,000
as we approach 2020 and the

1423
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,000
release. You know, we still have over a year to go, a year

1424
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,000
and a half to go before we get to October

1425
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,000
of 2020. So I'll be very curious to

1426
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,000
see what more develops in the coming months.

1427
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,000
So.

1428
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:12,000
All right. As Joe and I, Matt, points

1429
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,000
out, the main thing is they're taking their time.

1430
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,000
And Bobby Blackwolf pointing

1431
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:18,000
out they're not targeting people who would use pro controllers,

1432
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,000
they're targeting mobile users.

1433
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,000
We'll see. I am,

1434
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,000
I, I'll give it a chance. Let's, let's

1435
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:26,000
a lot of this is still

1436
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,000
hypothesis and theory. And that's,

1437
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,000
and that's fine. I like like,

1438
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,000
and I'm fine with the controllers

1439
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,000
being the way they are. I just hope that they

1440
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,000
have the forethought to like, we'll have

1441
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,000
Bluetooth and you bring your own damn controller

1442
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,000
if you want, you know, that, that's fine.

1443
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,000
Um, would be nice. I'm not saying they

1444
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:44,000
have to do it the way everybody

1445
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:46,000
else is doing it, but I

1446
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,000
mean, if I have my choice between,

1447
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,000
you know, using the

1448
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,000
type of controls I would on a mobile game

1449
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:54,000
versus an actual controller, I'm

1450
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,000
going to choose an actual controller.

1451
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:58,000
We will see. There's still a long way to go.

1452
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,000
Anyway, before we get to

1453
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,000
the release of Earthworm Jim, we're going to take

1454
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,000
a trip down memory lane and

1455
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,000
visit the classic game of the week. Every

1456
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,000
week here on the show, Dark Soccer steps into the

1457
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,000
gaming vault and tries to find a game that she thinks,

1458
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,000
hey, you kids, you should be checking this

1459
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,000
one out. This is a classic, y'all.

1460
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,000
We do talk about this one a lot. Yes.

1461
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,000
So, uh, yeah, we have brought this game up a few

1462
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,000
times. So, uh, and it's not a Sega game.

1463
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,000
Nope. It is an absolute

1464
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:24,000
Nintendo game. So what

1465
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,000
is the classic game of the week? Clu Clu Land,

1466
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,000
which came out in

1467
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,000
1984 in Japan

1468
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,000
and, uh,

1469
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,000
just under a year later in the

1470
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,000
U.S. and, uh, so in Japan it came out November

1471
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,000
22nd, 1984, and in the

1472
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,000
U.S. it came out October 18th, 1985,

1473
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,000
and then, uh, in 87

1474
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,000
in, uh, Europe.

1475
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,000
So Clu Clu Land, first of

1476
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,000
all, people are like, what does this have

1477
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,000
to do with, uh, is it Clu

1478
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,000
from Tron? What? Um, no.

1479
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,000
It actually is

1480
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,000
an, uh, Anglicization

1481
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,000
of, uh, the Japanese title

1482
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,000
Kuru Kuru, um,

1483
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,000
you know, uh, it was Kuru Kuru Land,

1484
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,000
which basically, Kuru Kuru is an

1485
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,000
onomatopoeia that means around and around.

1486
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,000
Uh, or you

1487
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,000
might have also heard Guru Guru, you know, same

1488
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,000
thing. Um, so basically

1489
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,000
the main character has to grab poles

1490
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,000
and swing around, so that's where it comes

1491
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,000
from. It's the same, uh,

1492
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,000
uh, kind of title for the Game Boy

1493
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,000
romance game, uh, Kuru Kuru Kururin.

1494
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,000
So, anyway, um,

1495
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,000
in Clu Clu Land you play

1496
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,000
a balloon fish named Bubbles in the U.S.

1497
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:30,000
She was Gloopy in Japan, which I think

1498
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,000
Gloopy's a funnier name. Um,

1499
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,000
she swims around in a maze trying

1500
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,000
to uncover these gold ingots.

1501
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,000
Um, so

1502
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:40,000
you basically,

1503
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,000
um, are fighting

1504
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,000
this sea urchin

1505
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,000
called Unira, who

1506
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,000
is stealing all of the treasures

1507
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,000
in the underwater kingdom of Clu Clu Land.

1508
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,000
So Bubbles has to retrieve

1509
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,000
all the treasure and spin around and gather all

1510
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,000
the gold ingots, um,

1511
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,000
and...

1512
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:00,000
The rupees.

1513
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,000
They look like rupees.

1514
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,000
Well, that's because they reuse all the

1515
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,000
things anyway. But at any

1516
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,000
rate, um, it is,

1517
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,000
uh,

1518
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,000
um, you know, she,

1519
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,000
if she gets attacked by an Unira

1520
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,000
then she'll lose a life. Um,

1521
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,000
she can also, though,

1522
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,000
uh, stun an Unira by using

1523
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,000
a sound, uh, a sound wave.

1524
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,000
Um,

1525
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,000
you can also lose your life if you fall into a

1526
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,000
black hole or when the time runs out. And

1527
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,000
of course, you run out of all lives, it's

1528
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,000
game over. Um,

1529
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,000
and then sometimes you have to

1530
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,000
pass over the ingots in an

1531
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,000
odd number to uncover them.

1532
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,000
And, cause they will go between

1533
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,000
their uncovered side and

1534
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,000
a dull side. You know, it's kind of like

1535
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,000
how, uh, um,

1536
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,000
Qbert goes in later levels where you have to do double jumps

1537
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,000
on some of the items. Um,

1538
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,000
there was, um,

1539
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:54,000
other versions that came out. There was a

1540
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,000
versus Clu Clu Land. Have you guys ever seen one?

1541
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,000
Oh god, I

1542
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,000
think I did once. I do

1543
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,000
remember, like a multi-versus

1544
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:04,000
machine and I think Clu Clu Land was one of them

1545
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,000
cause I kind of made fun of it. That's how I saw

1546
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:08,000
my first versus Clu Clu Land. It was

1547
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,000
at a Godfather's Pizza in Mobile, Alabama.

1548
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,000
Um,

1549
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,000
so, of course, you know, released

1550
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:16,000
for the coin-op Nintendo versus system.

1551
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,000
It had twice as many

1552
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:20,000
puzzles

1553
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,000
in a new

1554
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,000
enemy called Boss Unira.

1555
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,000
Um, different level themes and some other

1556
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,000
features. Um,

1557
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,000
and a port of this one was

1558
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,000
released as

1559
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,000
the final game for

1560
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:36,000
the Famicom Disk System

1561
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,000
as called Clu Clu Land.

1562
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:40,000
Welcome to New Clu Clu Land.

1563
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:42,000
Um, the

1564
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,000
NES version and the

1565
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,000
Famicom Disk System version are

1566
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,000
both unlockable in

1567
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,000
Game, uh, in Animal

1568
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,000
Crossing, the one on GameCube.

1569
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,000
Um, that was retitled

1570
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,000
as Clu Clu Land D

1571
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:58,000
outside of Japan. Um,

1572
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,000
other ports in 2001, there

1573
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,000
was a port to the Sharp Zaris

1574
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:04,000
PDA.

1575
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,000
Um, we had, uh, in

1576
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,000
2004, it was released

1577
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:10,000
on the Famicom

1578
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,000
Mini for Game Boy Advance.

1579
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,000
Um, Bubbles

1580
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,000
was also a trophy in Super Smash

1581
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,000
Brothers Melee. And the Clu Clu

1582
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:20,000
Land NES music and

1583
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,000
the Unira enemy are

1584
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,000
items in Super Smash Brothers Brawl.

1585
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:26,000
And, of course, they

1586
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,000
also re-return as items in

1587
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,000
Super Smash Brothers Ultimate.

1588
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,000
Um, she's also,

1589
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,000
uh, in a

1590
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,000
secret level of the

1591
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,000
Game Boy Advance game, DK King of Swing,

1592
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:40,000
which was

1593
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:42,000
pretty much inspired by Clu Clu Land.

1594
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,000
Um, there's a

1595
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,000
microgame of Clu Clu Land in

1596
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,000
WarioWare Smooth Moves for Wii.

1597
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:50,000
And, um,

1598
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,000
Clu Clu Land's

1599
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,000
Nintendo microgame in Mario

1600
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,000
Twisted. Uh, the

1601
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:58,000
rupee from the Legend of Zelda series was modeled

1602
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,000
after the Inkot sprite from

1603
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,000
Clu Clu Land.

1604
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,000
That money bag also looked like the money bag that was in

1605
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:06,000
Legend of Zelda Link to...

1606
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:08,000
or, uh, Adventures of Link.

1607
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:10,000
And they also said that the Dig Dogger enemy

1608
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,000
from, uh, Legend of Zelda

1609
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,000
series was basically based

1610
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,000
off of the Unira. Um,

1611
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,000
of course, Clu Clu Land is also one of the games

1612
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,000
included in NES remix.

1613
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,000
And there you have it.

1614
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:24,000
All right. Kuru Kuru Land.

1615
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,000
Your classic game of the week, a game

1616
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:28,000
that, uh, some of you in chat are like,

1617
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:30,000
I never really understood how this game works. What is this?

1618
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,000
What is this that's being drawn on stream right now?

1619
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:34,000
Glasses. Yep.

1620
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:36,000
How about that?

1621
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:38,000
Cause, I mean, a lot of them just were like, you know, little

1622
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,000
puzzles. Once you figured out

1623
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:42,000
what the puzzle piece was, then

1624
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,000
it was really easy to go in

1625
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:46,000
and figure out how

1626
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,000
to swing around them. Yeah.

1627
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,000
It's kind of like, um, it's kind of like that game, uh,

1628
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:52,000
Anticipation. Once you've played it enough,

1629
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:54,000
that little pencil draws, like, two lines

1630
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:56,000
and you know what the answer is.

1631
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:58,000
Ain't no Anticipa-

1632
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,000
Yeah. It makes that game a whole lot, uh,

1633
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,000
less fun at that point. I was trying to do

1634
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:04,000
a Rocky joke. I know. I know.

1635
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:06,000
All right. Uh, thank you for that classic game of the week

1636
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:08,000
selection. Um, speaking of classic games,

1637
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:10,000
uh, we have a contribution this week

1638
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,000
for our little, uh, break segment here we do in the

1639
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:14,000
middle of the show. And it is from, uh,

1640
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:16,000
our pal Bobby Blackwolf,

1641
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,000
who went to a classic game show in Atlanta last week

1642
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:20,000
and found this really cool,

1643
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:22,000
uh, TI 99

1644
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,000
4A. Y'all remember that computer?

1645
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:26,000
I think I had one. I had two.

1646
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:28,000
I, I didn't- I did it as a classic system

1647
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:30,000
remember? You did. That's right. You did do a

1648
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:32,000
classic system. Well get this. So what he's about

1649
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:34,000
to show us is Dragon's

1650
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:36,000
Lair, the 80s game

1651
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:38,000
running on a TI 99

1652
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,000
4A. What? And I, I don't mean

1653
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,000
like some scaled down port

1654
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:44,000
cause there was like a Commodore 64 version of Dragon's Lair

1655
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:46,000
but it was completely different. How much RAM do they have to put

1656
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:48,000
in this thing to make it work? Well, we're about

1657
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:50,000
to find out. So why don't we turn it over to Bobby

1658
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:52,000
and find out.

1659
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:54,000
Hello, Orange Lounge Radio. Bobby

1660
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:56,000
Blackwolf here. Uh, I know I'm

1661
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:58,000
usually on a couple hours ago

1662
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,000
but Rob really likes having

1663
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,000
content in the middle of the show and I'm here at the Vintage

1664
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:04,000
Computer Festival Southeast

1665
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:06,000
7.0 in Roswell, Georgia and

1666
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:08,000
uh, I saw a game that

1667
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:10,000
uh, is not a classic

1668
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:12,000
game of the week because it was just released

1669
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:14,000
but it's for really old

1670
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:16,000
systems and it's a really old game.

1671
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:18,000
So I have Alan here. Alan,

1672
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,000
what am I looking at here?

1673
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,000
You are looking at Dragon's Lair for the

1674
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:24,000
Texas Instruments TI 99

1675
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,000
for a home computer. And this is

1676
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,000
obviously the side-scrolling platformer

1677
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:30,000
that was released on the NES, right?

1678
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:32,000
Uh, I got something to do.

1679
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,000
No, absolutely not. This is an

1680
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:36,000
actual conversion. This is a

1681
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:38,000
fully licensed conversion of Dragon's

1682
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:40,000
Lair made by Harmless Lion

1683
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:42,000
and he took the high

1684
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:44,000
definition video and audio

1685
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:46,000
from the PC release in

1686
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:48,000
I think it was the early 2000s

1687
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:50,000
digitized it with his own software including

1688
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,000
the video and the audio and then produced

1689
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:54,000
the game out of it. He took 80

1690
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:56,000
megabytes of data, crammed

1691
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:58,000
it into this little cartridge that gets banked

1692
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,000
in 8K chunks

1693
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,000
and it's

1694
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:04,000
fully playable.

1695
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,000
And I have been playing it and it's

1696
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:08,000
just as unforgiving

1697
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:10,000
as I remember. But you

1698
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:12,000
really don't have like a laser displayer hiding

1699
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,000
under here, right? You're not doing like video trickery?

1700
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:16,000
No, no. Those are actually a little bit too expensive for my

1701
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:18,000
budget. So,

1702
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:20,000
how long do you, like, what's

1703
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:22,000
the backstory behind this? Like, how long did it take

1704
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:24,000
him to do it?

1705
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:26,000
I want to say it took him at least a couple

1706
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:28,000
of years to work on it but he's been actually building

1707
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:30,000
the fundamentals for a couple of

1708
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:32,000
decades.

1709
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:34,000
If you've

1710
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:36,000
been in the Atariage forums at all

1711
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,000
in the TI sub forums of Atariage

1712
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:40,000
you'll see where he's put up some

1713
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:42,000
demos here and there of sampled audio,

1714
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:44,000
sampled video. One of his

1715
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:46,000
first ones actually was Spaceballs

1716
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:48,000
that he did on a, I think it was a 4

1717
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:50,000
megabyte cartridge. And

1718
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,000
he says that this was his

1719
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:54,000
target game. This was one of the games he always wanted

1720
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:56,000
to do and he spent all this time

1721
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:58,000
getting the process perfected

1722
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:00,000
so he could produce it. So is

1723
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,000
this an unmodified TI-99

1724
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:04,000
or is this running any expansion boards that you're running it on here?

1725
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:06,000
No, this is a completely stock

1726
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:08,000
unexpanded TI-99 4A

1727
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:10,000
console. That means there's no 32K,

1728
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:12,000
it does not have the F18A

1729
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:14,000
replacement

1730
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:16,000
for the video processor. It's completely

1731
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:18,000
stock as if you opened the box

1732
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:20,000
in 1983.

1733
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:22,000
So do you know, is he worried about

1734
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:24,000
any takedowns like whoever owns

1735
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:26,000
the Dragon's Lair IP? Because we just saw

1736
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:28,000
the Super Mario Brothers Commodore 64

1737
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:30,000
conversion and apparently Nintendo

1738
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:32,000
sent a cease and desist once it hit the

1739
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:34,000
media sites. Has he been contacted

1740
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:36,000
by anybody that owns the rights or do we even know

1741
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:38,000
who has the Dragon's Lair rights right now?

1742
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:40,000
Well the rights to Dragon's Lair

1743
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:42,000
is owned by a company called

1744
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:44,000
Digital Leisure. I believe they're out of Canada

1745
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:46,000
and he actually contacted them,

1746
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:48,000
purchased a license and got their blessing

1747
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:50,000
on this conversion

1748
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:52,000
of Dragon's Lair for the TI.

1749
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:54,000
That's awesome. So

1750
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:56,000
I know there's a boxed copy

1751
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:58,000
here and I know that you're giving it away but where can

1752
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:00,000
people find it if they can't get a boxed copy?

1753
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,000
It's actually no longer available.

1754
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:04,000
He produced 155

1755
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:06,000
cartridges and he was able to

1756
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:08,000
ship all of his orders before the license expired

1757
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:10,000
for production and at this point

1758
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:12,000
there will never be another release of it.

1759
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:14,000
No ROMs anywhere?

1760
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:16,000
There are no ROMs anywhere and that has a lot

1761
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:18,000
to do with the licensing and

1762
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:20,000
plus it's just

1763
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:22,000
one of those things. It just kind of

1764
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:24,000
makes it a little bit more valuable

1765
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:26,000
that way. So if people want to play it they need

1766
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:28,000
to come to like a vintage computer festival somewhere?

1767
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:30,000
At this point yes. The only way to play it is if

1768
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:32,000
you know somebody who has it.

1769
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:34,000
Or if you win it here which I

1770
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:36,000
competed and

1771
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:38,000
got third to last.

1772
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:40,000
Actually I think you're fourth to last.

1773
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:42,000
I'm fourth to last now.

1774
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:44,000
Today right now I do have

1775
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:46,000
a fully boxed copy

1776
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:48,000
completely unopened

1777
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:50,000
ready for the winner today

1778
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:52,000
to take home with him. Right now

1779
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:54,000
we have about 20 minutes left

1780
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:56,000
in the contest. We do have a top score

1781
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:58,000
winner by the name of JR

1782
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:00,000
just walking around here having a good time

1783
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,000
waiting to take home his copy of Dragon's Lair.

1784
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:06,000
It was fun to play.

1785
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:08,000
I didn't do too well.

1786
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:10,000
He claimed the controller.

1787
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:12,000
But then he fixed the controller and I can't play again

1788
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:14,000
because I've already played.

1789
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:16,000
So I can't compete again.

1790
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:18,000
It runs on regular

1791
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:20,000
Atari style

1792
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:22,000
joystick and everything.

1793
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:24,000
It is what it says it is.

1794
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:26,000
It's really impressive.

1795
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:28,000
I remember seeing a demo of this.

1796
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:30,000
You had just gotten a demo last year.

1797
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:32,000
Yes. Last year at VCF

1798
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:34,000
I was able to obtain

1799
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:36,000
the demo

1800
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:38,000
from Mike Brent, Tursi,

1801
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:40,000
Harmless Lion.

1802
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:42,000
I was able to show it here

1803
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:44,000
and had it playing.

1804
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:46,000
It was quite amazing. A lot of people stopped by

1805
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:48,000
to take a look at it and we were really

1806
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:50,000
championing the bit to get the final release

1807
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:52,000
and we finally got it.

1808
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:54,000
The technical achievement

1809
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:56,000
is absolutely amazing.

1810
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:58,000
Now remember I said that this is

1811
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:00,000
an unmodified TI-99-4A

1812
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,000
but obviously an out of the

1813
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:04,000
box cartridge

1814
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:07,000
Is there some

1815
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:09,000
hardware trickery that's going on

1816
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:11,000
to actually make this work?

1817
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:13,000
There is absolutely some sorcery going on in here.

1818
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:15,000
Mike Brent

1819
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:17,000
he knows this hardware

1820
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:19,000
inside and out.

1821
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:21,000
This is an absolute masterpiece.

1822
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:23,000
A symphony of hardware and software.

1823
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:25,000
It's more than just the program.

1824
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:27,000
It took a cartridge that had not been

1825
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:29,000
invented. It extends the banking

1826
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:31,000
scheme of our cartridge port

1827
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:33,000
beyond what has ever been used.

1828
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:35,000
The cartridge actually has the ability

1829
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:37,000
to hold 128 megabytes of

1830
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:39,000
data banked in 8K chunks.

1831
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:41,000
He has it loaded with 80 megabytes

1832
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:43,000
of data right now for this game.

1833
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:45,000
So Mike put

1834
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:47,000
a lot of work, he's put a lot of time,

1835
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:49,000
blood, sweat and tears to make what is

1836
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:51,000
an absolute masterpiece.

1837
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:53,000
And I guess here's the question

1838
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:55,000
some people would ask

1839
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:57,000
is

1840
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:59,000
why

1841
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:01,000
would someone go through that?

1842
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:03,000
Why would someone do that?

1843
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:05,000
Why not?

1844
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:07,000
Because it's there.

1845
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:09,000
If you have that one thing

1846
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:11,000
that you really really want to do

1847
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:13,000
and you get the opportunity to do it

1848
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:15,000
you'd be a fool to pass it up.

1849
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:17,000
Dragon's Lair

1850
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:19,000
on the TI-99-4A

1851
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:21,000
hardware trickery

1852
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:23,000
but it's stock system

1853
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:25,000
and it does exactly what it says

1854
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:27,000
it does. So I'm going to send it back over to you Rob

1855
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:29,000
over in the OLR studios. Maybe this will

1856
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:31,000
be a classic game of the week in

1857
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:33,000
10 years since it just came out

1858
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:35,000
right now.

1859
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:37,000
And we're looking at some footage there that

1860
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:39,000
Bobby's closing the video up with. That looks

1861
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:41,000
great. I mean considering the hardware

1862
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:43,000
that it's on, that looks fantastic.

1863
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:45,000
That's great. So thank you so much

1864
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:47,000
Bobby for picking that up and checking

1865
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:49,000
that out for us there. That looked

1866
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:51,000
great. And I love that. I love the answer

1867
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:53,000
at the end there. Why do this?

1868
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:55,000
Why not?

1869
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:57,000
Well, I think

1870
01:34:57,000 --> 01:34:59,000
that's a really good question.

1871
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:01,000
I think that's a really good question.

1872
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:03,000
I think that's a really good question.

1873
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:05,000
Why not?

1874
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:07,000
I love it. I think the moment that he said

1875
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:09,000
that it was unmodified I was sort of like

1876
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:11,000
holy shit.

1877
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:13,000
Yeah. That's well done. Well done.

1878
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:15,000
Kudos to everybody involved with that because

1879
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:17,000
the person that was being interviewed there was not the creator.

1880
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:19,000
Of course I'm sure you picked up there in the interview

1881
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:21,000
but I was representing the game and I just

1882
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:23,000
I love

1883
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:25,000
people that will go to the great lengths to

1884
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:27,000
kind of do those things and preserve

1885
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:29,000
the classics even if it's in these very

1886
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:31,000
like strange

1887
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:33,000
ways. So super cool.

1888
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:35,000
And what you didn't see in that video is

1889
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:37,000
that Bobby actually went out to the parking lot

1890
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:39,000
and keyed the car of the winner of

1891
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:41,000
that Dragon's Lair cartridge.

1892
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:43,000
So sorry to the oh no I'm obviously making

1893
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:45,000
all that up there. But good job Bobby

1894
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:47,000
not getting last last place

1895
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:49,000
in that contest.

1896
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:51,000
He was what? Fourth from last. What was the

1897
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:53,000
contest? Playing Dragon's Lair? I think he was trying to get a high

1898
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:55,000
score on that Dragon's Lair game. Yeah I would have lost that.

1899
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:57,000
If you're not used to playing it.

1900
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:59,000
Oh god. I did some contest a

1901
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:01,000
long time ago. I think it was like Stampede on the

1902
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:03,000
Atari 2600 at some. And it was like

1903
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:05,000
the official Twin Galaxies

1904
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:07,000
ranking or something. I was like third from last place.

1905
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:09,000
So I didn't know what the hell I was doing.

1906
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:11,000
But I thought it was cool because as I was doing it they were giving me

1907
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:13,000
tips on how to get better at it. So

1908
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:15,000
it's kind of neat.

1909
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:17,000
The way you get

1910
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:19,000
the highest score is you fake

1911
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:21,000
your video or you

1912
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:23,000
upload a fake score online and say that

1913
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:25,000
the video is gone. Now Bobby

1914
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:27,000
in chat says the guy who won the cartridge

1915
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:29,000
actually has the arcade cabinet

1916
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:31,000
so he knew everything. Well you know

1917
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:33,000
what? At least you know it's going to a good home.

1918
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:35,000
You know if somebody splurged the money for the

1919
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:37,000
arcade cabinet you know they're a fan of Dragon's

1920
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:39,000
Lair and so you know what?

1921
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:41,000
It's going to go to a good home. And maybe something

1922
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:43,000
you know I know we joke about

1923
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:45,000
could that be a classic game here in ten years

1924
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:47,000
on OLR the TI. I don't know if the

1925
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:49,000
original Dragon's Lair has surely been a

1926
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:51,000
classic game at some point. I don't know. I would think.

1927
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:53,000
But maybe not.

1928
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:55,000
Alright now do Space Ace.

1929
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:59,000
You know what really impressed me?

1930
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:01,000
Now you got to do Space Ace.

1931
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:03,000
No. Anyway.

1932
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:05,000
Thank you Bobby. Thank you for the segment

1933
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:07,000

1943
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:27,000
In the meantime let's get

1944
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:29,000
to some rapid fire news and

1945
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:31,000
travel. Oh thank you. Bobby says he will

1946
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:33,000
upload that to YouTube if the podcast

1947
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:35,000
audience wants to actually see what

1948
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:37,000
that looked like because you can hear the audio there

1949
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:39,000
especially at the end. You can only hear the audio and hear

1950
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:41,000
how you know again for a

1951
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:43,000
TI-9944A how

1952
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:45,000
faithful it is. But yeah hopefully

1953
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:47,000
you get to see that there. Thank you Bobby.

1954
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:49,000
Alright let's get into some rapid

1955
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:51,000
fire news and some quick other

1956
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:53,000
news that happened around the world this week.

1957
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:55,000
Yes. So let's talk a little

1958
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:57,000
bit about what's coming out for

1959
01:37:57,000 --> 01:37:59,000
your free game. Well your

1960
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:01,000
games with paid subscription

1961
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:03,000
to online services.

1962
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:05,000
Not really free. I can't believe it's not free.

1963
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:07,000
Here's what's coming out

1964
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:09,000
on Xbox and on PlayStation.

1965
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:11,000
So Xbox One for May. We're

1966
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:13,000
getting Marooners from

1967
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:15,000
May 1st to the 31st and the Golf

1968
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:17,000
Club 2019 featuring PGA

1969
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:19,000
Tour from May 16th through the

1970
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:21,000
15th of June.

1971
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:23,000
And then

1972
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:25,000
on the Xbox 360

1973
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:27,000
which is also of course backwards compatible

1974
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:29,000
with Xbox One.

1975
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:31,000
Comic Jumper from May 16th

1976
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:33,000
to the 31st and last but not least

1977
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:35,000
Earth Defense Force Insect Armageddon on

1978
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:37,000
May 1st through the 15th. Definitely

1979
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:39,000
go check that out because it's awesome.

1980
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:41,000
It's a spin off but it's fun. I'll be sure

1981
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:43,000
to download that in your honor Loki since I

1982
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:45,000
know you don't have an Xbox One but I do. But I

1983
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:47,000
have that game on my Xbox 360

1984
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:49,000
and I actually have that on PC too

1985
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:51,000
so you know.

1986
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:53,000
Like I would question it.

1987
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:55,000
Yes.

1988
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:57,000
And then of course this is pretty awesome but

1989
01:38:57,000 --> 01:38:59,000
so

1990
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:01,000
For Honor they've got

1991
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:03,000
now of course since

1992
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:05,000
May the 4th was

1993
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:07,000
yesterday and that's a big Star

1994
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:09,000
Wars day so along with that

1995
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:11,000
in For Honor you can use now

1996
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:13,000
light

1997
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:15,000
sabers that aren't

1998
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:17,000
legally, legally not

1999
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:19,000
light saber but laser

2000
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:21,000
sword type weapons

2001
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:23,000
can be used and

2002
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:25,000
you can go check those out if you have that game.

2003
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:27,000
So laser

2004
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:29,000
weapons. Bright swords.

2005
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:31,000
Very bright swords.

2006
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:33,000
Sabers of

2007
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:35,000
lasers.

2008
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:37,000
That's true. I keep forgetting like yesterday was a

2009
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:39,000
Star Wars holiday.

2010
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:41,000
Using my quotey fingers but I guess like an actual

2011
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:43,000
thing in California was here and they made some honorary

2012
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:45,000
holiday you know not a real holiday but one of those

2013
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:47,000
like honorary holidays was like official in

2014
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:49,000
California now so it's kind of fun. Yeah.

2015
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:51,000
Which by the way you know happy single

2016
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:53,000
to my own I guess you know.

2017
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:55,000
I actually you know what's funny. It's revenge of the 5th.

2018
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:57,000
I

2019
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:59,000
I went to brunch with some friends this morning

2020
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:01,000
and it was you know I had to suggest the place

2021
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:03,000
because they suggested the place last time. So I was

2022
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:05,000
like oh let's go and I was just

2023
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:07,000
last night I was like oh Alan really likes that new taco

2024
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:09,000
bar place and there's a it opened up

2025
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:11,000
they just opened up one up in Folsom so let's

2026
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:13,000
go to the taco bar place. Not even thinking

2027
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:15,000
today's Cinco de Mayo.

2028
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:17,000
And I get up this morning and I go oh fuck

2029
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:19,000
it's Cinco de Mayo and I just suggested we

2030
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:21,000
go to the taco place. Oh yeah. Luckily

2031
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:23,000
we got there early enough it wasn't

2032
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:25,000
horrible but by the time we were

2033
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:27,000
leaving it was like a shit show

2034
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:29,000
waiting to get in. They had like the radio station out there

2035
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:31,000
doing promotions and everything. I should have gotten

2036
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:33,000
tacos today. It would have been probably cheaper.

2037
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:35,000
Yeah right.

2038
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:37,000
I forgot. Gosh.

2039
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:39,000
Alright moving on. Other rapid fire news.

2040
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:41,000
Let's talk about Anthem. Let's talk about

2041
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:43,000
a game that's

2042
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:45,000
kind of not done so

2043
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:47,000
well in the fan base.

2044
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:49,000
Well BioWare is reassuring

2045
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:51,000
folks that Anthem is not being abandoned

2046
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:53,000
even though it sure is starting to look that way

2047
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:55,000
because executive

2048
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:57,000
producer Mark Dara and lead producer

2049
01:40:57,000 --> 01:40:59,000
Michael Gamble both have started

2050
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:01,000
working on other BioWare projects.

2051
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:03,000
And what's interesting Mark Dara

2052
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:05,000
over on Twitter at BioMarkDara

2053
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:07,000
said we aren't working on Dragon

2054
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:09,000
Age 3. We aren't working on Dragon

2055
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:11,000
Age 5 dot dot dot

2056
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:13,000
I guess that's that.

2057
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:15,000
Like just fucking pointing

2058
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:17,000
a laser sword right at the

2059
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:19,000
fact that the team has very clearly

2060
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:21,000
moved on to Dragon Age 4. Many of them.

2061
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:23,000
Well right cause you know

2062
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:25,000
Dragon Age 3 already came out.

2063
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:27,000
Well yeah of course. It was Inquisition.

2064
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:29,000
3 was Inquisition if you didn't already know.

2065
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:31,000
Which was awesome.

2066
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:33,000
Anyway well hopefully Dragon Age 4 is awesome

2067
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:35,000
because but anyway it was very

2068
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:37,000
important also because

2069
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:39,000
even though some of these high profile folks have left

2070
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:41,000
BioWare is reaffirming

2071
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:43,000
commitment to Anthem's follow through

2072
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:45,000
on some of the shortcomings that they had

2073
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:47,000
earlier. So Michael

2074
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:49,000
Gamble in a tweet said there's been a lot of

2075
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:51,000
incorrect speculation on this.

2076
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:53,000
The studio's support and commitment to

2077
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:55,000
Anthem has not changed.

2078
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:57,000
Quoting a tweet from Chad Robertson at BioWare

2079
01:41:57,000 --> 01:41:59,000
who said we remain 100% committed to Anthem

2080
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:01,000
and look forward to showing players the new content

2081
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:03,000
we're working on. We want to make sure we aren't

2082
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:05,000
over promising so our updates on what's

2083
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:07,000
coming in the game will be focused

2084
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:09,000
when we have things near completion.

2085
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:11,000
So my

2086
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:13,000
understanding is they put out a calendar that they

2087
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:15,000
haven't really been able to follow very well and just

2088
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:17,000
Anthem

2089
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:19,000
I just unfortunately

2090
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:21,000
like everything that we just kind of feared

2091
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:23,000
was going to happen with Anthem is happening

2092
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:25,000
and I think that's all we really need to

2093
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:27,000
say about that. Best of luck to the team and

2094
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:29,000
I hope they're able to make a Diablo

2095
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:31,000
3-esque situation out of this but

2096
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:33,000
yeah.

2097
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:35,000
Anyhow let's move on

2098
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:37,000
and talk about a

2099
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:39,000
Kickstarter that met its goal

2100
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:41,000
this week. I think we brought this up on the show

2101
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:43,000
previously. Antstream is the

2102
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:45,000
Kickstarter. They met their goal.

2103
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:47,000
And I should disclose I ended up backing

2104
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:49,000
it. Somebody actually posted to Discord

2105
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:51,000
that they met their goal and that was the reminder

2106
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:53,000
to me I was like oh yeah shit I was

2107
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:55,000
supposed to go donate my money so I did

2108
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:57,000
and they've actually hit their first stretch

2109
01:42:57,000 --> 01:42:59,000
goal which is going to be prioritized

2110
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:01,000
they don't want to over promise when

2111
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:03,000
Playstation 4 support is coming but they're prioritizing

2112
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:05,000
Playstation 4 support

2113
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:07,000
so that will be something that

2114
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:09,000
happens. If you are not familiar with

2115
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:11,000
Antstream

2116
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:13,000
it is a

2117
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:15,000
kind of trying to legalize what a lot

2118
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:17,000
of you are doing through ROMs

2119
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:19,000
and it's going to be allowing you to play

2120
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:21,000
games on the Amiga, the Commodore 64

2121
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:23,000
Sega Genesis

2122
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:25,000
the ZX Spectrum

2123
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:27,000
because this is actually a company that's based

2124
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:29,000
over in Britain

2125
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:31,000
so obviously the ZX was a much

2126
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:33,000
bigger deal over there and Commodore was a huge deal over there too

2127
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:35,000
so they're focusing a lot on those systems

2128
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:37,000
but this will be out in the US as well they are saying

2129
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:39,000
and US people can back the Kickstarter which I think

2130
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:41,000
has 4 or 5 more days on it

2131
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:43,000
they showed some early alpha

2132
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:45,000
play on a recent

2133
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:47,000
charity stream overseas

2134
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:49,000
and that was when I watched that

2135
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:51,000
that really kind of sold me on it. They were playing Double Dragon

2136
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:53,000
and they were doing like

2137
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:55,000
challenges and one of the challenges

2138
01:43:55,000 --> 01:43:57,000
they were doing was as many headbutts

2139
01:43:57,000 --> 01:43:59,000
as they could in one segment of the game in 60 seconds

2140
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:01,000
and I thought those challenges

2141
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:03,000
were cool and something

2142
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:05,000
to add to retro

2143
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:07,000
that isn't already there

2144
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:09,000
because again I shouldn't be

2145
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:11,000
reading the comments section but my stupid

2146
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:13,000
ass always inevitably does

2147
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:15,000
and a lot of people taking issue with

2148
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:17,000
Antstream because

2149
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:19,000
the games are old

2150
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:21,000
people are emulating them anyway

2151
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:23,000
and you're fucking doing it illegally

2152
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:25,000
like you can sugar coat it all you want

2153
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:27,000
but technically you're not supposed to be

2154
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:29,000
doing that. It's just that you know they have an

2155
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:31,000
enforcer line. Here's the

2156
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:33,000
more valid criticism of

2157
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:35,000
Antstream that you know

2158
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:37,000
Antstream is streaming

2159
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:39,000
so you're not downloading the ROMs to your computer

2160
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:41,000
or your Xbox and playing them off

2161
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:43,000
that. You are streaming it like

2162
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:45,000
Google Stadia but

2163
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:47,000
again these games are not at 1080p

2164
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:49,000
60 frames a second so I think there's a little more

2165
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:51,000
allowance. I think there's a lot of web pages that are

2166
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:53,000
probably larger than these games I mean

2167
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:55,000
I don't think that

2168
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:57,000
oh no I don't have

2169
01:44:57,000 --> 01:44:59,000
you know the resolution

2170
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:01,000
of my gigabit

2171
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:03,000
is going to be a lot lower I'm not so

2172
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:05,000
worried about if it's going to kill bandwidth

2173
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:07,000
or not but I do understand some people

2174
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:09,000
a little more hesitant because of that but I also understand

2175
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:11,000
that that is one way to make the

2176
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:13,000
experience consistent between

2177
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:15,000
Xbox One and mobile phones and all that stuff

2178
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:17,000
so anyway you know but

2179
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:19,000
take what I'm saying with a grain of salt I just told you

2180
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:21,000
I backed it so you know now I guess I have

2181
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:23,000
an investment in it for whatever it's worth

2182
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:25,000
but I just I'm excited

2183
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:27,000
to play the Commodore 64 games

2184
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:29,000
in an environment that reminds me

2185
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:31,000
of the old GameTap

2186
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:33,000
which has a little more competition going with it

2187
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:35,000
just a little more

2188
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:37,000
fun in some old classic games

2189
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:39,000
I wanted to mention real quick since I forgot

2190
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:41,000
to mention Playstation

2191
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:43,000
for the month of May we're getting

2192
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:45,000
Overcooked and

2193
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:47,000
Edith Finch so those are

2194
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:49,000
the two games we're getting. Ooh Edith Finch

2195
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:51,000
such a good game.

2196
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:53,000
Yeah and Dartitsuya says Anstream

2197
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:55,000
is getting the rights to host these so I don't think

2198
01:45:55,000 --> 01:45:57,000
there's any legality issues there. Nope

2199
01:45:57,000 --> 01:45:59,000
and you know what they said people would never

2200
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:01,000
pay for music once Napster

2201
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:03,000
and LimeWire and all that was a thing and then

2202
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:05,000
iTunes came out charged

2203
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:07,000
a reasonable rate made it real easy

2204
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:09,000
and completely changed the

2205
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:11,000
industry and of course now we're in a day

2206
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:13,000
iTunes is still doing its thing

2207
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:15,000
but now it's probably more on that side Apple

2208
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:17,000
Music and Spotify and Pandora

2209
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:19,000
and everything in that streaming space

2210
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:21,000
ironically here we are talking about streaming

2211
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:23,000
that legitimizes it so

2212
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:25,000
anyway enough talk about that let's move on

2213
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:27,000
to another rapid fire story Dark Sakura

2214
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:29,000
Well it's finally happening

2215
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:31,000
and we've kept bringing it up but Bloodstained

2216
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:33,000
is happening yay

2217
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:35,000
Finally. Um so

2218
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:37,000
it looks like we have a

2219
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:39,000
release date for Xbox One, PS4

2220
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:41,000
and PC that's gonna be on

2221
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:43,000
June 18th and the Switch

2222
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:45,000
version will be out on June 25th

2223
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:47,000
um but

2224
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:49,000
the time seems to have been just

2225
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:51,000
from what I you know I can tell

2226
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:53,000
that the extra development time should really make it a

2227
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:55,000
very stellar release. Did you see that

2228
01:46:55,000 --> 01:46:57,000
trailer they put out recently that had like

2229
01:46:57,000 --> 01:46:59,000
Igarashi in it going we heard

2230
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:01,000
that you thought the graphics were crap

2231
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:03,000
so we made it better it was very self

2232
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:05,000
aware again going back to what we kicked

2233
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:07,000
off the show with this week fan backlash

2234
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:09,000
causing changes. Well

2235
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:11,000
it does look really good. But yeah it is

2236
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:13,000
designed by Igarashi

2237
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:15,000
Koji who is such

2238
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:17,000
a rock star that was like the happy thing

2239
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:19,000
of my last E3 was getting to meet him

2240
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:21,000
and then

2241
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:23,000
of course the thing that actually I'm most

2242
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:25,000
excited about is the music because

2243
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:27,000
the music is

2244
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:29,000
done by Yamare Michiru

2245
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:31,000
who was the lady who did all the music

2246
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:33,000
for Symphony of the Night and

2247
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:35,000
Yamare Ippo who was

2248
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:37,000
Resident Evil

2249
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:39,000
musician

2250
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:41,000
so I'm really really looking forward

2251
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:43,000
to that also it's supposed to be like an even

2252
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:45,000
bigger castle like the largest

2253
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:47,000
one in any of Igarashi's games

2254
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:49,000
so I'm excited

2255
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:51,000
I might be a little bit

2256
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:53,000
more excited than I can

2257
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:55,000
safely keep us PG rated

2258
01:47:55,000 --> 01:47:57,000
In this game my dick is

2259
01:47:57,000 --> 01:47:59,000
bigger than ever with this castle

2260
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:01,000
right? Yeah

2261
01:48:01,000 --> 01:48:03,000
his castle dick

2262
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:05,000
and then of course there's been

2263
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:07,000
this trailer floating around for

2264
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:09,000
Left 4 Dead 3

2265
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:11,000
yeah it's fake

2266
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:13,000
It's fake. If you believe that Valve was doing

2267
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:15,000
a game with a 3 in it you were setting yourself up

2268
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:17,000
for failure. Yeah

2269
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:19,000
I believe someday that that's gonna

2270
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:21,000
happen

2271
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:23,000
and it'll be all of the games all the

2272
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:25,000
3. Today is not that day. No.

2273
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:27,000
But you can

2274
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:29,000
pretty much you can

2275
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:31,000
look at it there's some other

2276
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:33,000
red flags that

2277
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:35,000
indicate that it's fake apart from

2278
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:37,000
Valve just denying it

2279
01:48:37,000 --> 01:48:39,000
you know there's like

2280
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:41,000
licensed items in

2281
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:43,000
the game like Quaker Oats

2282
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:45,000
and they

2283
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:47,000
use like maps in it from some of the

2284
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:49,000
other games so yeah if

2285
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:51,000
you look at it you can tell

2286
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:53,000
but

2287
01:48:53,000 --> 01:48:55,000
the only thing that we've really seen are

2288
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:57,000
just some like allegedly

2289
01:48:57,000 --> 01:48:59,000
leaked environmental screenshots

2290
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:01,000
Didn't we have a story

2291
01:49:01,000 --> 01:49:03,000
just like 2 or 3 weeks ago too that the

2292
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:05,000
Left 4 Dead team was working on it or like

2293
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:07,000
a lot of people that were involved with it were

2294
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:09,000
working on a very similar type of thing

2295
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:11,000
much akin to this burn out

2296
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:13,000
Destruction Derby or whatever

2297
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:15,000
that game is called they just put it out

2298
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:17,000
and I need to play it. Destructive

2299
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:19,000
Driving or something like that.

2300
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:21,000
Dangerous driving. Dangerous driving that's it.

2301
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:23,000
I'll be honest too. I went back

2302
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:25,000
to look at some of the screenshots

2303
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:27,000
and they don't look like they would be anything

2304
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:29,000
in a

2305
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:31,000
Left 4 Dead game like it's not

2306
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:33,000
anything that looks relatively modern

2307
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:35,000
unless it's like in Italy

2308
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:37,000
really damaged

2309
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:39,000
Italy or somewhere in the

2310
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:41,000
Middle East. Sorry I can't stop laughing

2311
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:43,000
Maybe Greece. I can't stop laughing now

2312
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:45,000
at calling that game Distracted Driving because now

2313
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:47,000
I'm just imagining a trailer that just

2314
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:49,000
shows like clips from burn out

2315
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:51,000
when you text on your phone and drive

2316
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:53,000
and then massive burn out

2317
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:55,000
you could cause an accident

2318
01:49:55,000 --> 01:49:57,000
and by the way

2319
01:49:57,000 --> 01:49:59,000
if anyone wants to see the

2320
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:01,000
images referred to

2321
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:03,000
it's a short URL so it's

2322
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:05,000
pronounced Imgur

2323
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:07,000
Imgur?

2324
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:09,000

Hope you write fast. It was Back 4

2331
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:23,000
Blood was their game. Back 4 Blood thank you

2332
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:25,000
Well and

2333
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:27,000
marvel at my NATO alphabet skills yo

2334
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:29,000
Alright let's

2335
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:31,000
move on and I'll link this in the chat

2336
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:33,000
Let's find some things that are coming out

2337
01:50:33,000 --> 01:50:35,000
soon as we look at some

2338
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:37,000
world release dates and some things that are coming out

2339
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:39,000
since Left 4 Dead 3 will not be

2340
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:41,000
Alright

2341
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:43,000
Well we're only getting a few

2342
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:45,000
games out this week so Life is Strange

2343
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:47,000
2 Episode 3 Wasteland

2344
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:49,000
that's coming on PC PlayStation 4 and Xbox

2345
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:51,000
1 Yakuza

2346
01:50:51,000 --> 01:50:53,000
Kiwami 2 is out on

2347
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:55,000
PC and finally

2348
01:50:55,000 --> 01:50:57,000
Saints Row 3rd coming out on

2349
01:50:57,000 --> 01:50:59,000
Nintendo Switch

2350
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:01,000
That's it

2351
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:03,000
Alright and if we travel to Japan

2352
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:05,000
there's no releases in Japan this week

2353
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:07,000
I believe Golden Week was last week

2354
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:09,000
maybe wrapping up right now. I don't remember exactly

2355
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:11,000
Everyone's coming back

2356
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:13,000
I don't remember exactly how many days it is but regardless

2357
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:15,000
it would be similar to like

2358
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:17,000
the day after Christmas. You're not gonna see any

2359
01:51:17,000 --> 01:51:19,000
games come out. If I'm correct in Golden Week

2360
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:21,000
one of the holidays involved in that

2361
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:23,000
has

2362
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:25,000
people going back to their hometowns

2363
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:27,000
so quite likely people

2364
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:29,000
would be coming back

2365
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:31,000
so no point in releasing

2366
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:33,000
anything. I mean it's a big deal there

2367
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:35,000
to like what Christmas is here

2368
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:37,000
when people travel and go

2369
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:39,000
they're gone for days and so forth

2370
01:51:39,000 --> 01:51:41,000
so just like here

2371
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:43,000
Business is shut down. Yeah you don't get

2372
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:45,000
the game releases don't pick up until

2373
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:47,000
mid-January after Christmas

2374
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:49,000
maybe you get

2375
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:51,000
now we're getting to see one or two big ones that will come out

2376
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:53,000
in a couple weeks after but yeah

2377
01:51:53,000 --> 01:51:55,000
anyway long story short no releases in Japan

2378
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:57,000
right now but there's good reason for it

2379
01:51:57,000 --> 01:51:59,000
just with the culture over there so

2380
01:51:59,000 --> 01:52:01,000
I will turn it over to Europe, Dark Sakura

2381
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:03,000
All of these come out

2382
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:05,000
on May 9th

2383
01:52:05,000 --> 01:52:07,000
and all of them are for Switch

2384
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:09,000
so Farm Expert 2019

2385
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:11,000
Mortal Kombat 11

2386
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:13,000
and Saints Row the Third

2387
01:52:13,000 --> 01:52:15,000
the full package

2388
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:17,000
An

2389
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:19,000
autoplay video on this site, sorry

2390
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:21,000
okay but that's all

2391
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:23,000
okay let's move on

2392
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:25,000
and we will go to the mailbag

2393
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:27,000
you guys send us emails

2394
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:29,000
participate at orange lounge radio

2395
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:31,000
dot com and we

2396
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:33,000
love to read these emails live on air

2397
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:35,000
and I believe we have one email tonight

2398
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:37,000
that we do saving you

2399
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:39,000
from Drag Race discussion

2400
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:41,000
yay thank you

2401
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:43,000
girl I got stuff to say about Silky

2402
01:52:43,000 --> 01:52:45,000
I know justice for that

2403
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:47,000
email that sloppy bitch

2404
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:49,000
anyway hello L.R.

2405
01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:51,000
I wanted to let Rob

2406
01:52:51,000 --> 01:52:53,000
know that his memory has not failed him

2407
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:55,000
there was in fact a two

2408
01:52:55,000 --> 01:52:57,000
versus two mode in Ultimate Mortal Kombat

2409
01:52:57,000 --> 01:52:59,000
3 I knew it it was relatively

2410
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:01,000
basic there was no tagging in or out

2411
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:03,000
just the second member of a team appearing

2412
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:05,000
when the first was KO'd and the round

2413
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:07,000
ending when both members are KO'd

2414
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:09,000
it would still

2415
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:11,000
it was still best two out of three

2416
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:13,000
it wasn't played very often

2417
01:53:13,000 --> 01:53:15,000
though since it cost double the price of an ordinary

2418
01:53:15,000 --> 01:53:17,000
versus match and it didn't typically

2419
01:53:17,000 --> 01:53:19,000
last twice as long I'm sure

2420
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:21,000
that a lot of folks forgot about it

2421
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:23,000
that is that everything is saying is correct

2422
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:25,000
but the arcade operator could set the price

2423
01:53:25,000 --> 01:53:27,000
of that I think the default was

2424
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:29,000
double but I remember a place that

2425
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:31,000
was only like one credit to do

2426
01:53:31,000 --> 01:53:33,000
that mode and it's a good way to like

2427
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:35,000
sample I mean the game had already been out for years

2428
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:37,000
at that point but it's a good way to sample multiple characters

2429
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:39,000
when you're like I don't know if I want to play Katana or

2430
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:41,000
Melina so you can do both

2431
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:43,000
so that's what was cool about it

2432
01:53:43,000 --> 01:53:45,000
that would be team sibling rivalry

2433
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:47,000
yes

2434
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:49,000
team I think I'm a clone now

2435
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:51,000
personally

2436
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:53,000
I was far more interested in Ultimate Mortal Combat 3's

2437
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:55,000
eight player tournament mode

2438
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:57,000
which set up a single elimination

2439
01:53:57,000 --> 01:53:59,000
tournament consisting of one round matches

2440
01:53:59,000 --> 01:54:01,000
between eight players the thing

2441
01:54:01,000 --> 01:54:03,000
cost eight credits to play but it was

2442
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:05,000
well worth it because when all the matches

2443
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:07,000
finished and a winner was crowned that person

2444
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:09,000
got to select any of the ending rewards

2445
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:11,000
available in the game including the supreme

2446
01:54:11,000 --> 01:54:13,000
demonstration remember that

2447
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:15,000
the machine would play every single finishing

2448
01:54:15,000 --> 01:54:17,000
move in the game which would take

2449
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:19,000
over seven minutes and

2450
01:54:19,000 --> 01:54:21,000
he sent us a link that I'm

2451
01:54:21,000 --> 01:54:23,000
going to post in chat

2452
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:25,000
her request

2453
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:27,000
we'll do a midpoint break some week

2454
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:29,000
where we just play the finishing move

2455
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:31,000
actually that would be a perfect bathroom

2456
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:33,000
break because it's seven minutes

2457
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:35,000
I never

2458
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:37,000
saw that mode I heard about it but I

2459
01:54:37,000 --> 01:54:39,000
never saw that tournament mode ever

2460
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:41,000
actually get used

2461
01:54:41,000 --> 01:54:43,000
so I have exactly

2462
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:45,000
once yeah so actually

2463
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:47,000
I love that you sent this email to

2464
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:49,000
kind of remind us I was like oh is that what it

2465
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:51,000
did or I guess that's one of the options

2466
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:53,000
but still that's really cool

2467
01:54:53,000 --> 01:54:55,000
at any rate I just posted it

2468
01:54:55,000 --> 01:54:57,000
in the chat and

2469
01:54:57,000 --> 01:54:59,000
if we want to add it in to maybe

2470
01:54:59,000 --> 01:55:01,000
show notes for posting the podcast

2471
01:55:01,000 --> 01:55:03,000
so if I remember I'll do my

2472
01:55:03,000 --> 01:55:05,000
best it's a YouTube so I'm sure if

2473
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:07,000
you just Google it it's a tube of the you

2474
01:55:07,000 --> 01:55:09,000
yes or are you sure you don't want me to read the URL

2475
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:11,000
girl it's a lot

2476
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:13,000
more complicated than what I read

2477
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:15,000
anyway thanks again for the show

2478
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:17,000
and have a great week hugs

2479
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:19,000
Aaron YYR

2480
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:21,000
well thanks thanks for that

2481
01:55:21,000 --> 01:55:23,000
I'm always down to talk about the old school Mortal Kombats

2482
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:25,000
well I don't know it's just

2483
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:27,000
sort of been like I've been in this

2484
01:55:27,000 --> 01:55:29,000
like crazy Mortal Kombat nostalgia

2485
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:31,000
if you go to

2486
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:33,000
my fan page

2487
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:35,000
which is Dark Sakura

2488
01:55:35,000 --> 01:55:37,000
I will link it in chat

2489
01:55:37,000 --> 01:55:39,000
for those here

2490
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:41,000
wink wink nudge nudge nudge nudge like my status

2491
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:43,000
well not just that actually

2492
01:55:43,000 --> 01:55:45,000
follow my page

2493
01:55:45,000 --> 01:55:47,000
but I linked

2494
01:55:47,000 --> 01:55:49,000
the old making of Mortal Kombat

2495
01:55:49,000 --> 01:55:51,000
so

2496
01:55:51,000 --> 01:55:53,000
which is pretty cool it's just basically how they did

2497
01:55:53,000 --> 01:55:55,000
a lot of the mocap this is a very

2498
01:55:55,000 --> 01:55:57,000
cool watch I mean it also

2499
01:55:57,000 --> 01:55:59,000
talks into just how primitive

2500
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:01,000
their mocap techniques were back then and how

2501
01:56:01,000 --> 01:56:03,000
it's evolved to what we have now

2502
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:05,000
so yeah that was the only other

2503
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:07,000
email so thank you YYR

2504
01:56:07,000 --> 01:56:09,000
Toshin a blast from the past

2505
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:11,000
in our chat tonight good to see you

2506
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:13,000
is in our chat saying a good thing the

2507
01:56:13,000 --> 01:56:15,000
new arcade 1up cabs out now

2508
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:17,000
make the modes more accessible

2509
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:19,000
you know I gotta say if I'm a really

2510
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:21,000
good boy on my spending I think I'm gonna buy myself

2511
01:56:21,000 --> 01:56:23,000
one of those cabinets I just

2512
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:25,000
I want it

2513
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:27,000
I don't

2514
01:56:27,000 --> 01:56:29,000
I want it there's just no

2515
01:56:29,000 --> 01:56:31,000
other explanation I want it

2516
01:56:31,000 --> 01:56:33,000
I want the Tempest one

2517
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:35,000
but

2518
01:56:35,000 --> 01:56:37,000
Black Knight sort of rage

2519
01:56:37,000 --> 01:56:39,000
oh yeah that's right you got that

2520
01:56:39,000 --> 01:56:41,000
Dan's like we'll be fine with the pro fuck no

2521
01:56:41,000 --> 01:56:43,000
it's not Black Knight without having the second

2522
01:56:43,000 --> 01:56:45,000
play field I want a fucking premium

2523
01:56:45,000 --> 01:56:47,000
stomp my foot

2524
01:56:47,000 --> 01:56:49,000
Veruca Salt moment

2525
01:56:49,000 --> 01:56:51,000
Bob Coffee in chat says the arcade 1up cabinets

2526
01:56:51,000 --> 01:56:53,000
are okay yeah I know they're not like the real thing

2527
01:56:53,000 --> 01:56:55,000
and they're smaller and it's a different type of screen

2528
01:56:55,000 --> 01:56:57,000
I want one!

2529
01:56:57,000 --> 01:56:59,000
I think those are bigger though aren't those

2530
01:56:59,000 --> 01:57:01,000
what they have like I think a little

2531
01:57:01,000 --> 01:57:03,000
I thought that they were bigger because I know that

2532
01:57:03,000 --> 01:57:05,000
like the Atari ones and stuff they have like a pedestal

2533
01:57:05,000 --> 01:57:07,000
that you put the cabinet on to make them

2534
01:57:07,000 --> 01:57:09,000
taller but I thought those were

2535
01:57:09,000 --> 01:57:11,000
just already taller because I mean

2536
01:57:11,000 --> 01:57:13,000
children aren't gonna be playing moral combat

2537
01:57:13,000 --> 01:57:15,000
it's a mature rated game right

2538
01:57:15,000 --> 01:57:17,000
yeah sure you wouldn't let

2539
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:19,000
your kids play it would you?

2540
01:57:19,000 --> 01:57:21,000
they wouldn't be interested

2541
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:23,000
exactly I probably would let them but

2542
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:25,000
they wouldn't be interested

2543
01:57:25,000 --> 01:57:27,000
this is too hard

2544
01:57:27,000 --> 01:57:29,000
I just remember though the biggest hype

2545
01:57:29,000 --> 01:57:31,000
about any Mortal Kombat ever in my experience

2546
01:57:31,000 --> 01:57:33,000
was Mortal Kombat 2 and this was

2547
01:57:33,000 --> 01:57:35,000
the year that we were taking the trip up the

2548
01:57:35,000 --> 01:57:37,000
east coast for my high school band

2549
01:57:37,000 --> 01:57:39,000
we actually played at Carnegie Hall

2550
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:41,000
and that was when all the

2551
01:57:41,000 --> 01:57:43,000
beta machines were still out

2552
01:57:43,000 --> 01:57:45,000
all up the east coast

2553
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:47,000
so we were like

2554
01:57:47,000 --> 01:57:49,000
which beta is this? and we had

2555
01:57:49,000 --> 01:57:51,000
everyone would have like three different print outs

2556
01:57:51,000 --> 01:57:53,000
based on the beta version that we would

2557
01:57:53,000 --> 01:57:55,000
try to figure out what we were playing

2558
01:57:55,000 --> 01:57:57,000
yeah I remember the first time

2559
01:57:57,000 --> 01:57:59,000
I saw Mortal Kombat 2 my mind was blown

2560
01:57:59,000 --> 01:58:01,000
I saw it at like a bowling alley

2561
01:58:01,000 --> 01:58:03,000
and like you know I'm sure we all saw the first game

2562
01:58:03,000 --> 01:58:05,000
and played it but like the second one was like

2563
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:07,000
somehow the graphics were even

2564
01:58:07,000 --> 01:58:09,000
better even though it was still that whole like

2565
01:58:09,000 --> 01:58:11,000
digitized people thing and it was just like my mind was

2566
01:58:11,000 --> 01:58:13,000
blown like so good

2567
01:58:13,000 --> 01:58:15,000
so and then I remember

2568
01:58:15,000 --> 01:58:17,000
seeing the third game for the first time and I was also

2569
01:58:17,000 --> 01:58:19,000
like wow this looks like really different

2570
01:58:19,000 --> 01:58:21,000
but I don't know even as much as I enjoy

2571
01:58:21,000 --> 01:58:23,000
the third game like it just it wasn't the

2572
01:58:23,000 --> 01:58:25,000
same as 2 I don't know what it is

2573
01:58:25,000 --> 01:58:27,000
2 just had like the magic

2574
01:58:27,000 --> 01:58:29,000
that 1 built

2575
01:58:29,000 --> 01:58:31,000
yeah cause 1 is

2576
01:58:31,000 --> 01:58:33,000
kind of hard to go back and play it because it was a

2577
01:58:33,000 --> 01:58:35,000
very slow game I think 3's

2578
01:58:35,000 --> 01:58:37,000
biggest problem was taking Sub-Zero's mask

2579
01:58:37,000 --> 01:58:39,000
off it just didn't feel the same

2580
01:58:39,000 --> 01:58:41,000
yeah but 2

2581
01:58:41,000 --> 01:58:43,000
had all the charm

2582
01:58:43,000 --> 01:58:45,000
and violence of 1

2583
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:47,000
but it was at a more playable speed

2584
01:58:47,000 --> 01:58:49,000
it was a faster game

2585
01:58:49,000 --> 01:58:51,000
alright anyhow

2586
01:58:51,000 --> 01:58:53,000
ok well our mailbag segment

2587
01:58:53,000 --> 01:58:55,000
turned into Mortal Kombat talk but hey that's ok

2588
01:58:55,000 --> 01:58:57,000
let's move on to some more

2589
01:58:57,000 --> 01:58:59,000
news alright now

2590
01:58:59,000 --> 01:59:01,000
Loki now what does it say up there

2591
01:59:01,000 --> 01:59:03,000
now what can we talk about

2592
01:59:03,000 --> 01:59:05,000
at this point in the show

2593
01:59:07,000 --> 01:59:09,000
fine I'm sure you have

2594
01:59:09,000 --> 01:59:11,000
some choice things to say to me right

2595
01:59:11,000 --> 01:59:13,000
so

2596
01:59:13,000 --> 01:59:15,000
Microsoft you know well aware

2597
01:59:15,000 --> 01:59:17,000
that their Xbox Live service is

2598
01:59:17,000 --> 01:59:19,000
full of the

2599
01:59:19,000 --> 01:59:21,000
best people so they

2600
01:59:21,000 --> 01:59:23,000
decided that they're gonna put out

2601
01:59:23,000 --> 01:59:25,000
acceptable trash talk examples

2602
01:59:25,000 --> 01:59:27,000
what I hadn't heard

2603
01:59:27,000 --> 01:59:29,000
and what not to do

2604
01:59:29,000 --> 01:59:31,000
when you're trash talking

2605
01:59:31,000 --> 01:59:33,000
so for example

2606
01:59:33,000 --> 01:59:35,000
some things that you shouldn't say

2607
01:59:35,000 --> 01:59:37,000
hey profanity

2608
01:59:37,000 --> 01:59:39,000
that was some serious potato aim

2609
01:59:39,000 --> 01:59:41,000
get wrecked trash

2610
01:59:41,000 --> 01:59:43,000
who the fuck talks like that?

2611
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:45,000
nobody talks like that

2612
01:59:45,000 --> 01:59:47,000
that was a very potato reading

2613
01:59:47,000 --> 01:59:49,000
get wrecked trash

2614
01:59:49,000 --> 01:59:51,000
the only reason you went positive

2615
01:59:51,000 --> 01:59:53,000
was you spent all game camping

2616
01:59:53,000 --> 01:59:55,000
kys kid

2617
01:59:55,000 --> 01:59:57,000
ok well you shouldn't tell children to kill

2618
01:59:57,000 --> 01:59:59,000
themselves you know what kys means right

2619
01:59:59,000 --> 02:00:01,000
yes I gather yes

2620
02:00:01,000 --> 02:00:03,000
kiss your savior

2621
02:00:03,000 --> 02:00:05,000
kiss your savior

2622
02:00:05,000 --> 02:00:07,000
cheap win

2623
02:00:07,000 --> 02:00:09,000
totally expected from a racial

2624
02:00:09,000 --> 02:00:11,000
slur

2625
02:00:11,000 --> 02:00:13,000
racial slurs are not ok I'm not gonna make fun of that

2626
02:00:13,000 --> 02:00:15,000
one they do need to get rid of those

2627
02:00:15,000 --> 02:00:17,000
but anyways yeah so they have this whole

2628
02:00:17,000 --> 02:00:19,000
website and they actually

2629
02:00:19,000 --> 02:00:21,000
broke it down by like different

2630
02:00:21,000 --> 02:00:23,000
categories of like how what you should

2631
02:00:23,000 --> 02:00:25,000
and should not do like attitude

2632
02:00:25,000 --> 02:00:27,000
and standards

2633
02:00:27,000 --> 02:00:29,000
keep it legal

2634
02:00:29,000 --> 02:00:31,000
attitude check

2635
02:00:31,000 --> 02:00:33,000
anyone? says Xbox Lives

2636
02:00:33,000 --> 02:00:35,000
Ville in all countries for example

2637
02:00:35,000 --> 02:00:37,000
you know build a club around illegal

2638
02:00:37,000 --> 02:00:39,000
drug use don't do that

2639
02:00:39,000 --> 02:00:41,000
create messages that encourage

2640
02:00:41,000 --> 02:00:43,000
underage drinking don't do that

2641
02:00:43,000 --> 02:00:45,000
tell other players to kill

2642
02:00:45,000 --> 02:00:47,000
themselves or commit self harm

2643
02:00:47,000 --> 02:00:49,000
don't do that upload

2644
02:00:49,000 --> 02:00:51,000
custom gamer pics that show animal

2645
02:00:51,000 --> 02:00:53,000
abuse why would you

2646
02:00:53,000 --> 02:00:55,000
do that

2647
02:00:55,000 --> 02:00:57,000
for example don't

2648
02:00:57,000 --> 02:00:59,000
spam into substance

2649
02:00:59,000 --> 02:01:01,000

2680
02:02:01,000 --> 02:02:03,000
you thought you were on my level

2681
02:02:03,000 --> 02:02:05,000
that was some serious potato aim

2682
02:02:05,000 --> 02:02:07,000
get rekt

2683
02:02:07,000 --> 02:02:09,000
so I can say that was potato aim

2684
02:02:09,000 --> 02:02:11,000
get rekt

2685
02:02:11,000 --> 02:02:13,000
cheap win come at me

2686
02:02:13,000 --> 02:02:15,000
when you can actually drive without running cars off

2687
02:02:15,000 --> 02:02:17,000
the road hey I take that personally

2688
02:02:17,000 --> 02:02:19,000
I can't keep the car on the road

2689
02:02:19,000 --> 02:02:21,000
and you know what

2690
02:02:21,000 --> 02:02:23,000
if they didn't want me to drive off road they wouldn't let me drive

2691
02:02:23,000 --> 02:02:25,000
off road

2692
02:02:27,000 --> 02:02:29,000
make stuff suitable for

2693
02:02:29,000 --> 02:02:31,000
all audiences for example

2694
02:02:31,000 --> 02:02:33,000
don't upload a custom

2695
02:02:33,000 --> 02:02:35,000
gamer pic that contains nudity

2696
02:02:35,000 --> 02:02:37,000
share send

2697
02:02:37,000 --> 02:02:39,000
loot messages to other players

2698
02:02:39,000 --> 02:02:41,000
hey

2699
02:02:41,000 --> 02:02:43,000
you want to slide into my DMs

2700
02:02:43,000 --> 02:02:45,000
TYS

2701
02:02:45,000 --> 02:02:47,000
harmful

2702
02:02:47,000 --> 02:02:49,000
behavior that has no place on

2703
02:02:49,000 --> 02:02:51,000
Xbox for example use

2704
02:02:51,000 --> 02:02:53,000
mods that explicitly support it

2705
02:02:53,000 --> 02:02:55,000
or that are not explicitly supported

2706
02:02:55,000 --> 02:02:57,000
by game developers you wouldn't

2707
02:02:57,000 --> 02:02:59,000
mod your game would you

2708
02:02:59,000 --> 02:03:01,000
exploit to duplicate

2709
02:03:01,000 --> 02:03:03,000
in-game items don't do

2710
02:03:03,000 --> 02:03:05,000
that bad people

2711
02:03:09,000 --> 02:03:11,000
connect modified or tampered

2712
02:03:11,000 --> 02:03:13,000
hardware to the Xbox Live

2713
02:03:15,000 --> 02:03:17,000
god this sounds lame

2714
02:03:17,000 --> 02:03:19,000
how about I do none of those things

2715
02:03:19,000 --> 02:03:21,000
we know that Xbox Live is this forever

2716
02:03:21,000 --> 02:03:23,000
punchline about that it's just trash

2717
02:03:23,000 --> 02:03:25,000
when you go on there and you

2718
02:03:25,000 --> 02:03:27,000
use voice chat so I understand

2719
02:03:27,000 --> 02:03:29,000
that Microsoft is under some pressure

2720
02:03:29,000 --> 02:03:31,000
to do literally anything about it

2721
02:03:31,000 --> 02:03:33,000
so this is that like it's

2722
02:03:33,000 --> 02:03:35,000
it's something it may not be much

2723
02:03:35,000 --> 02:03:37,000
but I know I've learned the term potato

2724
02:03:37,000 --> 02:03:39,000
aim I'm gonna use that

2725
02:03:39,000 --> 02:03:41,000
in a sentence at some point

2726
02:03:41,000 --> 02:03:43,000
that's how that's how I play overwatch

2727
02:03:43,000 --> 02:03:45,000
with my potato aim

2728
02:03:45,000 --> 02:03:47,000
straight Idaho

2729
02:03:47,000 --> 02:03:49,000
potato aim

2730
02:03:51,000 --> 02:03:53,000
anyway

2731
02:03:53,000 --> 02:03:55,000
Mr. Smoosh is yelling in the

2732
02:03:55,000 --> 02:03:57,000
other room that I have potato aim right now

2733
02:03:57,000 --> 02:03:59,000
be right back

2734
02:03:59,000 --> 02:04:01,000
I have to go cuddle him against his will

2735
02:04:01,000 --> 02:04:03,000
Bobby Blackwolf in chat says my potato aim

2736
02:04:03,000 --> 02:04:05,000
is so bad it's not even from Idaho

2737
02:04:11,000 --> 02:04:13,000
so like I'm trying to understand what they

2738
02:04:13,000 --> 02:04:15,000
I'm trying to fill in their blanks

2739
02:04:15,000 --> 02:04:17,000
here so get sexual threat

2740
02:04:17,000 --> 02:04:19,000
can't believe you thought you were on my

2741
02:04:19,000 --> 02:04:21,000
level like get fucked is that

2742
02:04:21,000 --> 02:04:23,000
like a sexual threat either get

2743
02:04:23,000 --> 02:04:25,000
fucked or get what

2744
02:04:25,000 --> 02:04:27,000
you would call if you force sex upon

2745
02:04:27,000 --> 02:04:29,000
someone against their will

2746
02:04:29,000 --> 02:04:31,000
I've I've heard of that one being

2747
02:04:31,000 --> 02:04:33,000
uh flinged around on Xbox Live

2748
02:04:33,000 --> 02:04:35,000
and it's not okay just to be

2749
02:04:35,000 --> 02:04:37,000
explicitly clear so

2750
02:04:37,000 --> 02:04:39,000
anyway again

2751
02:04:39,000 --> 02:04:41,000
Microsoft has to do something but

2752
02:04:41,000 --> 02:04:43,000
yeah at the end of the day if they're

2753
02:04:43,000 --> 02:04:45,000
not gonna ban people for being fuckheads

2754
02:04:45,000 --> 02:04:47,000
which I guess maybe I'm not supposed to

2755
02:04:47,000 --> 02:04:49,000
say but when you do say these types of things

2756
02:04:49,000 --> 02:04:51,000
you are in fact being a fuckhead so

2757
02:04:51,000 --> 02:04:53,000
what about just say get consensually

2758
02:04:53,000 --> 02:04:55,000
fucked like well

2759
02:04:55,000 --> 02:04:57,000
I don't know I don't because that that's

2760
02:04:57,000 --> 02:04:59,000
no I

2761
02:04:59,000 --> 02:05:01,000
anyway moving on

2762
02:05:01,000 --> 02:05:03,000
let's talk let's talk

2763
02:05:03,000 --> 02:05:05,000
about a company that is banning some fools

2764
02:05:05,000 --> 02:05:07,000
uh respawn behind

2765
02:05:07,000 --> 02:05:09,000
apex legends of course y'all playing some

2766
02:05:09,000 --> 02:05:11,000
apex legends well uh

2767
02:05:11,000 --> 02:05:13,000
770,000 of you just got

2768
02:05:13,000 --> 02:05:15,000
banned congratulations

2769
02:05:15,000 --> 02:05:17,000
although I would guess this is

2770
02:05:17,000 --> 02:05:19,000
probably not 770,000 individual

2771
02:05:19,000 --> 02:05:21,000
people this is probably

2772
02:05:21,000 --> 02:05:23,000
770 trolls with 1000

2773
02:05:23,000 --> 02:05:25,000
accounts or something along those lines

2774
02:05:25,000 --> 02:05:27,000
anyhow uh

2775
02:05:27,000 --> 02:05:29,000
respawn did I was

2776
02:05:29,000 --> 02:05:31,000
kind of looking at this going didn't we kind of

2777
02:05:31,000 --> 02:05:33,000
already have this and yeah

2778
02:05:33,000 --> 02:05:35,000
this is a follow up because respawn did

2779
02:05:35,000 --> 02:05:37,000
they said we've still got plans to deal with

2780
02:05:37,000 --> 02:05:39,000
cheaters we're not gonna tell you what those plans are

2781
02:05:39,000 --> 02:05:41,000
because we don't want you circumventing it so it has

2782
02:05:41,000 --> 02:05:43,000
to be a little bit vague but there was

2783
02:05:43,000 --> 02:05:45,000
another blog post that said

2784
02:05:45,000 --> 02:05:47,000
uh the recent added in-game

2785
02:05:47,000 --> 02:05:49,000
reporting tools had a big impact on

2786
02:05:49,000 --> 02:05:51,000
discovering new cheats including

2787
02:05:51,000 --> 02:05:53,000
previously undetectable cheats that are now being

2788
02:05:53,000 --> 02:05:55,000
found automatically via EAC

2789
02:05:55,000 --> 02:05:57,000
what's EAC is that EAC's cheat

2790
02:05:57,000 --> 02:05:59,000
controller is that an acronym for something else

2791
02:05:59,000 --> 02:06:01,000
EAC it's gotta be some probably some

2792
02:06:01,000 --> 02:06:03,000
yeah uh anyway total

2793
02:06:03,000 --> 02:06:05,000
bands are now at 770,000

2794
02:06:05,000 --> 02:06:07,000
players we've blocked

2795
02:06:07,000 --> 02:06:09,000
300,000 account creations

2796
02:06:09,000 --> 02:06:11,000
we've banned 4,000 cheat

2797
02:06:11,000 --> 02:06:13,000
seller accounts spammers in the

2798
02:06:13,000 --> 02:06:15,000
last 20 days total

2799
02:06:15,000 --> 02:06:17,000
matches on PC impacted by cheaters

2800
02:06:17,000 --> 02:06:19,000
or spammers has been reduced by over half

2801
02:06:19,000 --> 02:06:21,000
in the last month due to recent efforts

2802
02:06:21,000 --> 02:06:23,000
in a quote here

2803
02:06:23,000 --> 02:06:25,000
from Drew McCoy the executive producer

2804
02:06:25,000 --> 02:06:27,000
it is a constant war with the cheat

2805
02:06:27,000 --> 02:06:29,000
makers that we will continue to fight we take

2806
02:06:29,000 --> 02:06:31,000
cheating in Apex Legends incredibly seriously

2807
02:06:31,000 --> 02:06:33,000
and have a large amount of resources tackling

2808
02:06:33,000 --> 02:06:35,000
it from a variety of angles

2809
02:06:35,000 --> 02:06:37,000
uh saying he will be back next week

2810
02:06:37,000 --> 02:06:39,000
with an update on another one of these issues

2811
02:06:39,000 --> 02:06:41,000
called out in last week's post so

2812
02:06:41,000 --> 02:06:43,000
you better look out cause uh

2813
02:06:43,000 --> 02:06:45,000
Drew McCoy and the rest of the uh

2814
02:06:45,000 --> 02:06:47,000
Apex team is coming for you and

2815
02:06:47,000 --> 02:06:49,000
stop cheating in multiplayer games

2816
02:06:49,000 --> 02:06:51,000
like if you want to cheat in a single player game

2817
02:06:51,000 --> 02:06:53,000
or if you want to form your own little

2818
02:06:53,000 --> 02:06:55,000
instance with your friends where you're all

2819
02:06:55,000 --> 02:06:57,000
consensually cheating and all that stuff fine

2820
02:06:57,000 --> 02:06:59,000
go off have fun but

2821
02:06:59,000 --> 02:07:01,000
like don't inflict that stuff on strangers who

2822
02:07:01,000 --> 02:07:03,000
just want to play the game and have a good time alright

2823
02:07:03,000 --> 02:07:05,000
calm down so anyway

2824
02:07:05,000 --> 02:07:07,000
um yeah

2825
02:07:07,000 --> 02:07:09,000
it's true SD100 Matt says trolls find a way

2826
02:07:09,000 --> 02:07:11,000
active says trolls gonna troll

2827
02:07:11,000 --> 02:07:13,000
uh DJ Rama S says EAC is something called

2828
02:07:13,000 --> 02:07:15,000
easy anti cheat so I'm just I'm not

2829
02:07:15,000 --> 02:07:17,000
familiar with the uh term there so

2830
02:07:17,000 --> 02:07:19,000
alright well uh

2831
02:07:19,000 --> 02:07:21,000
yeah don't don't be a jerk

2832
02:07:21,000 --> 02:07:23,000
in Apex Legends that's the

2833
02:07:23,000 --> 02:07:25,000
that's the thing to take away from this

2834
02:07:25,000 --> 02:07:27,000
but it is an extremely

2835
02:07:27,000 --> 02:07:29,000
popular online game right now like

2836
02:07:29,000 --> 02:07:31,000
I don't is it still outperforming Fortnite

2837
02:07:31,000 --> 02:07:33,000
or how is that all calm down on Twitch

2838
02:07:33,000 --> 02:07:35,000
I don't know haven't looked at the rankings lately

2839
02:07:35,000 --> 02:07:37,000
probably pretty close it's it's still up there

2840
02:07:37,000 --> 02:07:39,000
until the next thing comes out you can't ignore

2841
02:07:39,000 --> 02:07:41,000
how uh what a big game it is right now

2842
02:07:41,000 --> 02:07:43,000
speaking of big games

2843
02:07:43,000 --> 02:07:45,000
whether Bobby Blackwolf wants to

2844
02:07:45,000 --> 02:07:47,000
believe it or not there's still a big one out there on mobile

2845
02:07:47,000 --> 02:07:49,000
right DarkSakura?

2846
02:07:49,000 --> 02:07:51,000
there's the Pokemans

2847
02:07:51,000 --> 02:07:53,000
uh there is

2848
02:07:53,000 --> 02:07:55,000
a uh

2849
02:07:55,000 --> 02:07:57,000
release of actually a

2850
02:07:57,000 --> 02:07:59,000
confirmation of information the Pokemon Go

2851
02:07:59,000 --> 02:08:01,000
community basically investigated into

2852
02:08:01,000 --> 02:08:03,000
the new late guardians but Niantic actually

2853
02:08:03,000 --> 02:08:05,000
did announce that Uxie

2854
02:08:05,000 --> 02:08:07,000
Mesprite

2855
02:08:07,000 --> 02:08:09,000
and Azelf

2856
02:08:09,000 --> 02:08:11,000
whatever names um

2857
02:08:11,000 --> 02:08:13,000
are all going to be available via

2858
02:08:13,000 --> 02:08:15,000
region specific raids through May

2859
02:08:15,000 --> 02:08:17,000
27th

2860
02:08:17,000 --> 02:08:19,000
they were random spawns

2861
02:08:19,000 --> 02:08:21,000
they were hard to find but now you can

2862
02:08:21,000 --> 02:08:23,000
get them from your

2863
02:08:23,000 --> 02:08:25,000
raids Asia Pacific

2864
02:08:25,000 --> 02:08:27,000
is gonna get Uxie

2865
02:08:27,000 --> 02:08:29,000
Eastern

2866
02:08:29,000 --> 02:08:31,000
sorry European Union Middle East

2867
02:08:31,000 --> 02:08:33,000
Africa India gets Mesprite

2868
02:08:33,000 --> 02:08:35,000
and America and Greenland

2869
02:08:35,000 --> 02:08:37,000
get Azelf

2870
02:08:37,000 --> 02:08:39,000
so there you go

2871
02:08:39,000 --> 02:08:41,000
there the late guardians from gen 4

2872
02:08:41,000 --> 02:08:43,000
now I know they haven't confirmed

2873
02:08:43,000 --> 02:08:45,000
this yet but my assumption is

2874
02:08:45,000 --> 02:08:47,000
that these guys are gonna rotate

2875
02:08:47,000 --> 02:08:49,000
cause didn't the dogs from gen 2

2876
02:08:49,000 --> 02:08:51,000
they did the same thing like

2877
02:08:51,000 --> 02:08:53,000
one region got you know one dog

2878
02:08:53,000 --> 02:08:55,000
another got you know another

2879
02:08:55,000 --> 02:08:57,000
and then they rotated so like this should be like

2880
02:08:57,000 --> 02:08:59,000
the next three months worth of raids right

2881
02:08:59,000 --> 02:09:01,000
yeah that's my assumption anyway

2882
02:09:01,000 --> 02:09:03,000
so interesting

2883
02:09:03,000 --> 02:09:05,000
uh I have yet to catch one you know

2884
02:09:05,000 --> 02:09:07,000
I as much as you know we tease

2885
02:09:07,000 --> 02:09:09,000
Bobby Blockwolf and I know he's teasing us right back

2886
02:09:09,000 --> 02:09:11,000
when he says hashtag dead game

2887
02:09:11,000 --> 02:09:13,000
and we're like no it's not um I

2888
02:09:13,000 --> 02:09:15,000
I do notice that like

2889
02:09:15,000 --> 02:09:17,000
the raid scene is kinda

2890
02:09:17,000 --> 02:09:19,000
it's at least around me it's kinda slowing

2891
02:09:19,000 --> 02:09:21,000
down cause I think people are just getting a little burned out

2892
02:09:21,000 --> 02:09:23,000
kinda feels like it's just like the same thing

2893
02:09:23,000 --> 02:09:25,000
and the Pokemon aren't that exciting

2894
02:09:25,000 --> 02:09:27,000
and there's so many events

2895
02:09:27,000 --> 02:09:29,000
I'm not sure what the game could do

2896
02:09:29,000 --> 02:09:31,000
to really wake people up I don't know if the

2897
02:09:31,000 --> 02:09:33,000
secret is just release gen 5

2898
02:09:33,000 --> 02:09:35,000
I don't know

2899
02:09:35,000 --> 02:09:37,000
do you think there's something Pokemon Go

2900
02:09:37,000 --> 02:09:39,000
could do to get people kinda like back

2901
02:09:39,000 --> 02:09:41,000
interested in it again

2902
02:09:41,000 --> 02:09:43,000
make it competitive

2903
02:09:43,000 --> 02:09:45,000
yeah I mean they have PVP

2904
02:09:45,000 --> 02:09:47,000
well they have PVP but it's kinda

2905
02:09:47,000 --> 02:09:49,000
it's very much a side show you know what I mean

2906
02:09:49,000 --> 02:09:51,000
I don't know I think it's fun right now

2907
02:09:51,000 --> 02:09:53,000
uh oh Totion

2908
02:09:53,000 --> 02:09:55,000
in chat says Niantic said no rotation

2909
02:09:55,000 --> 02:09:57,000
right now what

2910
02:09:57,000 --> 02:09:59,000
I think they really want people to trade

2911
02:09:59,000 --> 02:10:01,000
for that stuff you're gonna have to really be able to

2912
02:10:01,000 --> 02:10:03,000
trade long distance stuff I think they're gonna

2913
02:10:03,000 --> 02:10:05,000
end up doing the rotation or they'll

2914
02:10:05,000 --> 02:10:07,000
they'll make it like quest

2915
02:10:07,000 --> 02:10:09,000
rewards or something like that I don't know

2916
02:10:09,000 --> 02:10:11,000
that's probably what's gonna end up happening

2917
02:10:11,000 --> 02:10:13,000
we'll see or maybe you'll have to

2918
02:10:13,000 --> 02:10:15,000
get real lucky and catch them in the wild

2919
02:10:15,000 --> 02:10:17,000
which apparently has been a thing going on

2920
02:10:17,000 --> 02:10:19,000
alright well Loki along

2921
02:10:19,000 --> 02:10:21,000
the Pokemon lines yeah so they're doing

2922
02:10:21,000 --> 02:10:23,000
this brand new app that's coming out now

2923
02:10:23,000 --> 02:10:25,000
called Pokemon Pass

2924
02:10:25,000 --> 02:10:27,000
which is gonna be separate from Pokemon Go

2925
02:10:27,000 --> 02:10:29,000
but you can actually get Pokemon

2926
02:10:29,000 --> 02:10:31,000
much like you did in the 3DS or

2927
02:10:31,000 --> 02:10:33,000
the DS at different locations

2928
02:10:33,000 --> 02:10:35,000
they'll unlock different things

2929
02:10:35,000 --> 02:10:37,000
like for example the first

2930
02:10:37,000 --> 02:10:39,000
thing that's gonna be

2931
02:10:39,000 --> 02:10:41,000
available is on

2932
02:10:41,000 --> 02:10:43,000
May 11th and if you have

2933
02:10:43,000 --> 02:10:45,000
Pokemon Let's Go with the app it'll allow you

2934
02:10:45,000 --> 02:10:47,000
to unlock a shiny Pikachu or

2935
02:10:47,000 --> 02:10:49,000
shiny Eevee for Let's Go

2936
02:10:49,000 --> 02:10:51,000
so that's if you go to Target

2937
02:10:51,000 --> 02:10:53,000
and

2938
02:10:53,000 --> 02:10:55,000
use your app there

2939
02:10:55,000 --> 02:10:57,000
ok wait so you're gonna have to

2940
02:10:57,000 --> 02:10:59,000
scan a QR code? I think

2941
02:10:59,000 --> 02:11:01,000
so that's it?

2942
02:11:01,000 --> 02:11:03,000
like you use this

2943
02:11:03,000 --> 02:11:05,000
app to scan a QR code

2944
02:11:05,000 --> 02:11:07,000
and so I have to go to Target

2945
02:11:07,000 --> 02:11:09,000
to get that QR code gosh

2946
02:11:09,000 --> 02:11:11,000
there's no possible way

2947
02:11:11,000 --> 02:11:13,000
a QR code

2948
02:11:13,000 --> 02:11:15,000
that correct me if I'm wrong never

2949
02:11:15,000 --> 02:11:17,000
changes right Loki it's just gonna be the same

2950
02:11:17,000 --> 02:11:19,000
QR code on like a cardboard I don't know that

2951
02:11:19,000 --> 02:11:21,000
yeah there's no way

2952
02:11:21,000 --> 02:11:23,000
that like I don't know if somebody

2953
02:11:23,000 --> 02:11:25,000
could take like a picture of that and

2954
02:11:25,000 --> 02:11:27,000
put it on

2955
02:11:27,000 --> 02:11:29,000
the internet and I could just

2956
02:11:29,000 --> 02:11:31,000
scan my monitor

2957
02:11:31,000 --> 02:11:33,000
if it's like a poster up

2958
02:11:33,000 --> 02:11:35,000
on the wall yes

2959
02:11:35,000 --> 02:11:37,000
if it's like an app or something like

2960
02:11:37,000 --> 02:11:39,000
in the store like a kiosk or something that

2961
02:11:39,000 --> 02:11:41,000
generates a unique QR code

2962
02:11:41,000 --> 02:11:43,000
for you then perhaps

2963
02:11:43,000 --> 02:11:45,000
ok that's gonna be a little harder yeah

2964
02:11:45,000 --> 02:11:47,000
let's think about the minimal

2965
02:11:47,000 --> 02:11:49,000
viable product here it's gonna be a fucking

2966
02:11:49,000 --> 02:11:51,000
poster and that'll

2967
02:11:51,000 --> 02:11:53,000
be up on the internet immediately and

2968
02:11:53,000 --> 02:11:55,000
yeah

2969
02:11:55,000 --> 02:11:57,000
cause that's what happened with the um

2970
02:11:57,000 --> 02:11:59,000
god what was that game

2971
02:11:59,000 --> 02:12:01,000
that was trying to compete against Pokemon

2972
02:12:01,000 --> 02:12:03,000
yokai watch ok so yokai watch had

2973
02:12:03,000 --> 02:12:05,000
QR codes in it right and there was kind of like

2974
02:12:05,000 --> 02:12:07,000
a similar thing with the anime I think had

2975
02:12:07,000 --> 02:12:09,000
QR codes in it you could like scan it in the anime

2976
02:12:09,000 --> 02:12:11,000
yeah that shit was on the internet in days

2977
02:12:11,000 --> 02:12:13,000
you know hours minutes

2978
02:12:13,000 --> 02:12:15,000
you know it's just not

2979
02:12:15,000 --> 02:12:17,000
yeah I'm sure that's what's gonna happen with Pokemon

2980
02:12:17,000 --> 02:12:19,000
pass as well but hey I

2981
02:12:19,000 --> 02:12:21,000
hey I'm all for extra

2982
02:12:21,000 --> 02:12:23,000
things and extra perks in these

2983
02:12:23,000 --> 02:12:25,000
games fun right

2984
02:12:25,000 --> 02:12:27,000
why not yeah we'll see maybe

2985
02:12:27,000 --> 02:12:29,000
if if they then and act F

2986
02:12:29,000 --> 02:12:31,000
and chat is telling me about the last story with the

2987
02:12:31,000 --> 02:12:33,000
Pokemon rights they'll keep them regional since they'll

2988
02:12:33,000 --> 02:12:35,000
still be appearing in the wild maybe I'll have to use

2989
02:12:35,000 --> 02:12:37,000
a QR code to get them maybe that'll be

2990
02:12:37,000 --> 02:12:39,000
the thing who knows

2991
02:12:39,000 --> 02:12:41,000
we'll see what Pokemon pass lends

2992
02:12:41,000 --> 02:12:43,000
itself to later

2993
02:12:43,000 --> 02:12:45,000
act F says the QR is already on the

2994
02:12:45,000 --> 02:12:47,000
internet well that didn't take long uh

2995
02:12:47,000 --> 02:12:49,000
and maybe you know what maybe this is how they

2996
02:12:49,000 --> 02:12:51,000
plan to do

2997
02:12:51,000 --> 02:12:53,000
the legendary distributions

2998
02:12:53,000 --> 02:12:55,000
uh for the gen 8

2999
02:12:55,000 --> 02:12:57,000
games for um

3000
02:12:57,000 --> 02:12:59,000
I already forget the name sword and shield

3001
02:12:59,000 --> 02:13:01,000
and gun

3002
02:13:01,000 --> 02:13:03,000
this is how they plan to distribute

3003
02:13:03,000 --> 02:13:05,000
for sword and shield is that

3004
02:13:05,000 --> 02:13:07,000
they're gonna use this app and do it instead of those

3005
02:13:07,000 --> 02:13:09,000
game stop cards with the codes

3006
02:13:09,000 --> 02:13:11,000
who knows anyway

3007
02:13:11,000 --> 02:13:13,000

vog network vognetwork.com

3016
02:13:29,000 --> 02:13:31,000
slash discord but uh

3017
02:13:31,000 --> 02:13:33,000
our last official story tonight has to do with

3018
02:13:33,000 --> 02:13:35,000
a game that's pretty old at this point but it was on a ton

3019
02:13:35,000 --> 02:13:37,000
of uh it was like on PC it was on the original

3020
02:13:37,000 --> 02:13:39,000
Wii it was on it was all over it's a game called

3021
02:13:39,000 --> 02:13:41,000
World of Goo well

3022
02:13:41,000 --> 02:13:43,000
World of Goo got a PC

3023
02:13:43,000 --> 02:13:45,000
update this week and that game hasn't been

3024
02:13:45,000 --> 02:13:47,000
updated in probably 10 years

3025
02:13:47,000 --> 02:13:49,000
what's interesting about this update

3026
02:13:49,000 --> 02:13:51,000
this isn't some little like bug fix

3027
02:13:51,000 --> 02:13:53,000
all these years later update or things like that

3028
02:13:53,000 --> 02:13:55,000
actually what's really cool about this

3029
02:13:55,000 --> 02:13:57,000
it changes the

3030
02:13:57,000 --> 02:13:59,000
resolutions to now do a

3031
02:13:59,000 --> 02:14:01,000
16 by 9 display because when the game

3032
02:14:01,000 --> 02:14:03,000
came out 4 by 3 was a little bit

3033
02:14:03,000 --> 02:14:05,000
more of the standard and it

3034
02:14:05,000 --> 02:14:07,000
has an HD makeover because the original

3035
02:14:07,000 --> 02:14:09,000
resolution of the game only ran at

3036
02:14:09,000 --> 02:14:11,000
800 by 600 so

3037
02:14:11,000 --> 02:14:13,000
no no HD version

3038
02:14:13,000 --> 02:14:15,000
no no remaster just

3039
02:14:15,000 --> 02:14:17,000
an update to World of Goo to make

3040
02:14:17,000 --> 02:14:19,000
it better I should point out though

3041
02:14:19,000 --> 02:14:21,000
no new levels no new challenges

3042
02:14:21,000 --> 02:14:23,000
they didn't really change anything in the game but still very

3043
02:14:23,000 --> 02:14:25,000
cool that they are updating it to support

3044
02:14:25,000 --> 02:14:27,000
more modern PCs

3045
02:14:27,000 --> 02:14:29,000
so hooray for that

3046
02:14:29,000 --> 02:14:31,000
a polite applause for a

3047
02:14:31,000 --> 02:14:33,000
game maker willing to go back and update their very old

3048
02:14:33,000 --> 02:14:35,000
game but again I think a lot of people probably

3049
02:14:35,000 --> 02:14:37,000
own this because they just it was so many sales

3050
02:14:37,000 --> 02:14:39,000
and so many things of that

3051
02:14:39,000 --> 02:14:41,000
nature and so forth I'm just uh

3052
02:14:41,000 --> 02:14:43,000
very very uh happy to

3053
02:14:43,000 --> 02:14:45,000
see that so alright

3054
02:14:45,000 --> 02:14:47,000
so anyway um

3055
02:14:47,000 --> 02:14:49,000
oh gosh okay I don't

3056
02:14:49,000 --> 02:14:51,000
I don't usually read these on air

3057
02:14:51,000 --> 02:14:53,000
I don't usually read all these at once because it

3058
02:14:53,000 --> 02:14:55,000
kind of derails the show a little bit but this is a big one

3059
02:14:55,000 --> 02:14:57,000
and plus we're getting into the listener round table anyway

3060
02:14:57,000 --> 02:14:59,000
so it's appropriate to read it this time

3061
02:14:59,000 --> 02:15:01,000
um but I do want to acknowledge this we

3062
02:15:01,000 --> 02:15:05,000
just got 3,500 biddies

3063
02:15:05,000 --> 02:15:07,000
from that's a lot of biddies

3064
02:15:07,000 --> 02:15:09,000
we just got 3,500 biddies

3065
02:15:09,000 --> 02:15:11,000
from uh schmagtastic in our

3066
02:15:11,000 --> 02:15:13,000
chat saying um and I hope

3067
02:15:13,000 --> 02:15:15,000
I said your name right I'm sorry if I butchered

3068
02:15:15,000 --> 02:15:17,000
it especially after what a sweet gesture that is

3069
02:15:17,000 --> 02:15:19,000
saying this podcast was

3070
02:15:19,000 --> 02:15:21,000
literally my adolescence and has transcended

3071
02:15:21,000 --> 02:15:23,000
into my adulthood again

3072
02:15:23,000 --> 02:15:25,000
just extending my gratitude to you all

3073
02:15:25,000 --> 02:15:27,000
for such a great community and podcast

3074
02:15:27,000 --> 02:15:29,000
so allow me to express

3075
02:15:29,000 --> 02:15:31,000
my gratitude for you uh

3076
02:15:31,000 --> 02:15:33,000
for for doing that and uh thank you

3077
02:15:33,000 --> 02:15:35,000
um it's and it's not just about the biddies

3078
02:15:35,000 --> 02:15:37,000
I mean don't get me wrong appreciate it but

3079
02:15:37,000 --> 02:15:39,000
uh just even

3080
02:15:39,000 --> 02:15:41,000
just saying that just the fact that

3081
02:15:41,000 --> 02:15:43,000
we've had that impact on somebody

3082
02:15:43,000 --> 02:15:45,000
in some sort of little way just means

3083
02:15:45,000 --> 02:15:47,000
a lot that's it

3084
02:15:47,000 --> 02:15:49,000
always kind of blows me away like for one

3085
02:15:49,000 --> 02:15:51,000
that we've been doing this show as long as we

3086
02:15:51,000 --> 02:15:53,000
have

3087
02:15:53,000 --> 02:15:55,000
and the other is just like how many people

3088
02:15:55,000 --> 02:15:57,000
have really stuck with us for

3089
02:15:57,000 --> 02:15:59,000
um as long you know and I realized

3090
02:15:59,000 --> 02:16:01,000
people come and people go and I

3091
02:16:01,000 --> 02:16:03,000
I know I name checked um

3092
02:16:03,000 --> 02:16:05,000
toshin earlier in the show who was kind of like

3093
02:16:05,000 --> 02:16:07,000
I think a listener back in the like all games

3094
02:16:07,000 --> 02:16:09,000
days which was a while ago at this point

3095
02:16:09,000 --> 02:16:11,000
right Boggs been around since about 2012

3096
02:16:11,000 --> 02:16:13,000
um and so all games when did all games

3097
02:16:13,000 --> 02:16:15,000
start all games started I think around 2006

3098
02:16:15,000 --> 02:16:17,000
well I'm sorry when we joined all games

3099
02:16:17,000 --> 02:16:19,000
around before that you know what I mean um

3100
02:16:19,000 --> 02:16:21,000
our time with them started in like 2006

3101
02:16:21,000 --> 02:16:23,000
so I mean just to think like

3102
02:16:23,000 --> 02:16:25,000
oh my god like they were listening I'm a PSP

3103
02:16:25,000 --> 02:16:27,000
how many years are really

3104
02:16:27,000 --> 02:16:29,000
shminktastic was on the beat I'm telling you that

3105
02:16:29,000 --> 02:16:31,000
PSP thing doesn't get enough

3106
02:16:31,000 --> 02:16:33,000
credit I would say that that OLR

3107
02:16:33,000 --> 02:16:35,000
PSP rest in peace because it's

3108
02:16:35,000 --> 02:16:37,000
sadly it's no longer there because I mean

3109
02:16:37,000 --> 02:16:39,000
why would it be but that

3110
02:16:39,000 --> 02:16:41,000
OLR PSP probably brought

3111
02:16:41,000 --> 02:16:43,000
more people to OLR

3112
02:16:43,000 --> 02:16:45,000
than anything else in our history

3113
02:16:45,000 --> 02:16:47,000
save for the launch of

3114
02:16:47,000 --> 02:16:49,000
iTunes podcasting and us being

3115
02:16:49,000 --> 02:16:51,000
one of the original shows in it that's

3116
02:16:51,000 --> 02:16:53,000
probably the only thing I can

3117
02:16:53,000 --> 02:16:55,000
think of there that really comes close

3118
02:16:55,000 --> 02:16:57,000
so yeah

3119
02:16:57,000 --> 02:16:59,000
that's and there's so many folks in chat yeah

3120
02:16:59,000 --> 02:17:01,000
OLR PSP I listen on the

3121
02:17:01,000 --> 02:17:03,000
PSP too fuck I wish I could make lightning

3122
02:17:03,000 --> 02:17:05,000
strike twice too bad there wasn't an OLR

3123
02:17:05,000 --> 02:17:07,000
Vita but it wasn't really the same thing on the

3124
02:17:07,000 --> 02:17:09,000
Vita the PSP was different because

3125
02:17:09,000 --> 02:17:11,000
we were really able to build

3126
02:17:11,000 --> 02:17:13,000
something there that really felt like

3127
02:17:13,000 --> 02:17:15,000
you were like unlocking a new

3128
02:17:15,000 --> 02:17:17,000
ability within your PSP you know what I mean

3129
02:17:17,000 --> 02:17:19,000
with the whole listing on shoutcast like

3130
02:17:19,000 --> 02:17:21,000
a lot of people didn't really know how to do that and you made it

3131
02:17:21,000 --> 02:17:23,000
so easy with that website and it

3132
02:17:23,000 --> 02:17:25,000
looked really cool and was like built for a

3133
02:17:25,000 --> 02:17:27,000
PSP of mine that I just think like

3134
02:17:27,000 --> 02:17:29,000
yeah again anyway I

3135
02:17:29,000 --> 02:17:31,000
just is it on like one of those like web

3136
02:17:31,000 --> 02:17:33,000
archives or something the OLR PSP site

3137
02:17:33,000 --> 02:17:35,000
it's gotta be like there's gotta be a way for

3138
02:17:35,000 --> 02:17:37,000
you guys to see it and what it like for those

3139
02:17:37,000 --> 02:17:39,000
have no idea what I'm talking about if you're like newer to the show

3140
02:17:39,000 --> 02:17:41,000
because it really was for

3141
02:17:41,000 --> 02:17:43,000
for the time it was really cool

3142
02:17:43,000 --> 02:17:45,000
I'm actually trying to learn Swift

3143
02:17:45,000 --> 02:17:47,000
so I can make

3144
02:17:47,000 --> 02:17:49,000
an iOS app

3145
02:17:49,000 --> 02:17:51,000
oh that'd be sweet for us

3146
02:17:51,000 --> 02:17:53,000
I I'm just starting

3147
02:17:53,000 --> 02:17:55,000
my research so

3148
02:17:55,000 --> 02:17:57,000
I mean to be fair maybe all of fog network

3149
02:17:57,000 --> 02:17:59,000
would want an app but yeah you know

3150
02:17:59,000 --> 02:18:01,000
I started

3151
02:18:01,000 --> 02:18:03,000
I mean I had started on the idea

3152
02:18:03,000 --> 02:18:05,000
like a few years ago

3153
02:18:05,000 --> 02:18:07,000
yeah it's just that they've

3154
02:18:07,000 --> 02:18:09,000
changed so many things since then

3155
02:18:09,000 --> 02:18:11,000
you gotta stay on top of that stuff

3156
02:18:11,000 --> 02:18:13,000
it's outdone before you even

3157
02:18:13,000 --> 02:18:15,000
know it so anyway

3158
02:18:15,000 --> 02:18:17,000
big big thank you for that

3159
02:18:17,000 --> 02:18:19,000
and yeah Bobby agrees it was worth

3160
02:18:19,000 --> 02:18:21,000
breaking the rules for and I'm

3161
02:18:21,000 --> 02:18:23,000
okay with that I really really am

3162
02:18:23,000 --> 02:18:25,000
yeah I can post a link there's

3163
02:18:25,000 --> 02:18:27,000
a way back oh is there is on the way back

3164
02:18:27,000 --> 02:18:29,000
machine yeah sweet post that in chat

3165
02:18:29,000 --> 02:18:31,000
that's awesome I love that

3166
02:18:31,000 --> 02:18:33,000
anyway we are I did not get the

3167
02:18:33,000 --> 02:18:35,000
studio on the freaking discord server actually

3168
02:18:35,000 --> 02:18:37,000
before I take calls we do have at least

3169
02:18:37,000 --> 02:18:39,000
one person in the green room did you want to

3170
02:18:39,000 --> 02:18:41,000
do any last minute stories I know I had

3171
02:18:41,000 --> 02:18:43,000
to cut sure I can talk about

3172
02:18:43,000 --> 02:18:45,000
there do you like one story then we get to you remember

3173
02:18:45,000 --> 02:18:47,000
that we talked a little bit about the overwatch

3174
02:18:47,000 --> 02:18:49,000
kind of

3175
02:18:49,000 --> 02:18:51,000
was it the

3176
02:18:51,000 --> 02:18:53,000
thing that they were doing for the the mods

3177
02:18:53,000 --> 02:18:55,000
and stuff like that so someone actually

3178
02:18:55,000 --> 02:18:57,000
created of course a portal gun in there

3179
02:18:57,000 --> 02:18:59,000
so now you can have your portal fun along

3180
02:18:59,000 --> 02:19:01,000
with the

3181
02:19:01,000 --> 02:19:03,000
as one of the game types in overwatch

3182
02:19:03,000 --> 02:19:05,000
now so that's kind of neat that they have that

3183
02:19:05,000 --> 02:19:07,000
that's cool I forgot to mention during my gaming week I actually

3184
02:19:07,000 --> 02:19:09,000
played overwatch which I haven't played in a while but I was

3185
02:19:09,000 --> 02:19:11,000
like oh shit that special event is

3186
02:19:11,000 --> 02:19:13,000
about to run out and I haven't even done it yet so I

3187
02:19:13,000 --> 02:19:15,000
went in and I did like the story mode and the use

3188
02:19:15,000 --> 02:19:17,000
any hero mode and all that

3189
02:19:17,000 --> 02:19:19,000
and the opening movie is kind of

3190
02:19:19,000 --> 02:19:21,000
long this time but it's well done

3191
02:19:21,000 --> 02:19:23,000
it's good I just wish like

3192
02:19:23,000 --> 02:19:25,000
there's seriously only one character

3193
02:19:25,000 --> 02:19:27,000
in the story mode version that I can play

3194
02:19:27,000 --> 02:19:29,000
half decently and that's mercy

3195
02:19:29,000 --> 02:19:31,000
I guess if if I was forced to

3196
02:19:31,000 --> 02:19:33,000
I could kind of do Winston but I am

3197
02:19:33,000 --> 02:19:35,000
terrible with Genji and Tracer

3198
02:19:35,000 --> 02:19:37,000
terrible so but I mean

3199
02:19:37,000 --> 02:19:39,000
I think it's cool that that's okay I'm terrible at the entire

3200
02:19:39,000 --> 02:19:41,000
game

3201
02:19:41,000 --> 02:19:43,000
that's fair

3202
02:19:43,000 --> 02:19:45,000
let me

3203
02:19:45,000 --> 02:19:47,000
answer that since you can ask questions in

3204
02:19:47,000 --> 02:19:49,000
chat as well and then we'll get to a call here

3205
02:19:49,000 --> 02:19:51,000
schmaketastic wants to know is Loki

3206
02:19:51,000 --> 02:19:53,000
still doing any game coding last

3207
02:19:53,000 --> 02:19:55,000
I heard he was messing around with C++ or

3208
02:19:55,000 --> 02:19:57,000
something it's been a few months since I've tuned in

3209
02:19:57,000 --> 02:19:59,000
well let me tell you

3210
02:19:59,000 --> 02:20:01,000
so I guess some good notes

3211
02:20:01,000 --> 02:20:03,000
the kid has written more games

3212
02:20:03,000 --> 02:20:05,000
at this point than Loki has

3213
02:20:05,000 --> 02:20:07,000
the kid

3214
02:20:07,000 --> 02:20:09,000
the kid is doing coding actually

3215
02:20:09,000 --> 02:20:11,000
which is pretty amazing and I

3216
02:20:11,000 --> 02:20:13,000
hope at some point he'll have a game that

3217
02:20:13,000 --> 02:20:15,000
we want to say hey y'all should go check

3218
02:20:15,000 --> 02:20:17,000
this out we made a game

3219
02:20:17,000 --> 02:20:19,000
about John Cena memes it was pretty awesome

3220
02:20:19,000 --> 02:20:21,000
he's kind of gotten done with doing John Cena

3221
02:20:21,000 --> 02:20:23,000
stuff in fact that's actually it's funny

3222
02:20:23,000 --> 02:20:25,000
like we were no we had that

3223
02:20:25,000 --> 02:20:27,000
conversation the other day about like

3224
02:20:27,000 --> 02:20:29,000
um

3225
02:20:29,000 --> 02:20:31,000
because the owner of the I always talk to the owner

3226
02:20:31,000 --> 02:20:33,000
of the place when I'm there

3227
02:20:33,000 --> 02:20:35,000
and he's like yeah I've noticed that he's

3228
02:20:35,000 --> 02:20:37,000
stopped putting John Cena in every single

3229
02:20:37,000 --> 02:20:39,000
one of his games that he submits

3230
02:20:39,000 --> 02:20:41,000
so

3231
02:20:41,000 --> 02:20:43,000
so he's doing like no he

3232
02:20:43,000 --> 02:20:45,000
he finished one now it's it

3233
02:20:45,000 --> 02:20:47,000
was called Dragon Racing so they had

3234
02:20:47,000 --> 02:20:49,000
the like you have the race dragon

3235
02:20:49,000 --> 02:20:51,000
around like a little track thing

3236
02:20:51,000 --> 02:20:53,000
he has to do one now it's called

3237
02:20:53,000 --> 02:20:55,000
uh because Ninja

3238
02:20:55,000 --> 02:20:57,000
Invaders it's basically he has to create

3239
02:20:57,000 --> 02:20:59,000
a ninja character that

3240
02:20:59,000 --> 02:21:01,000
move you move and avoid

3241
02:21:01,000 --> 02:21:03,000
like stuff coming towards it kind of like

3242
02:21:03,000 --> 02:21:05,000
a space shooter avoid object

3243
02:21:05,000 --> 02:21:07,000
thing so he has to work on that

3244
02:21:07,000 --> 02:21:09,000
so he's got about like he's about halfway

3245
02:21:09,000 --> 02:21:11,000
through the white belt course and then

3246
02:21:11,000 --> 02:21:13,000
he's gonna go through that he has to do

3247
02:21:13,000 --> 02:21:15,000
some robotic stuff and then there's some they

3248
02:21:15,000 --> 02:21:17,000
call improve yourselves which is basically

3249
02:21:17,000 --> 02:21:19,000
here's a challenge but we're not gonna tell you how to do

3250
02:21:19,000 --> 02:21:21,000
it you have to do it based on all of the

3251
02:21:21,000 --> 02:21:23,000
knowledge that you have and it's kind of like a test

3252
02:21:23,000 --> 02:21:25,000
and once he does that then he moves

3253
02:21:25,000 --> 02:21:27,000
to yellow belt which is

3254
02:21:27,000 --> 02:21:29,000
then um JavaScript

3255
02:21:29,000 --> 02:21:31,000
so he's gonna start getting in JavaScript and

3256
02:21:31,000 --> 02:21:33,000
you guys have to remember because if you haven't listened

3257
02:21:33,000 --> 02:21:35,000
in a while you might not recall Loki's

3258
02:21:35,000 --> 02:21:37,000
kid is eight yeah eight years old

3259
02:21:37,000 --> 02:21:39,000
and this this is what they're doing now

3260
02:21:39,000 --> 02:21:41,000
when I was eight years old we

3261
02:21:41,000 --> 02:21:43,000
were plunking around on an Apple 2e doing

3262
02:21:43,000 --> 02:21:45,000
logo not the television

3263
02:21:45,000 --> 02:21:47,000
network the pen

3264
02:21:47,000 --> 02:21:49,000
down forward 30

3265
02:21:49,000 --> 02:21:51,000
pen up when I

3266
02:21:51,000 --> 02:21:53,000
was eight years old I was learning French

3267
02:21:53,000 --> 02:21:55,000
if I

3268
02:21:55,000 --> 02:21:57,000
look if I look here I probably

3269
02:21:57,000 --> 02:21:59,000
could post a couple of his games in chat because

3270
02:21:59,000 --> 02:22:01,000
I get linked on them every single time

3271
02:22:01,000 --> 02:22:03,000
that he uh he goes

3272
02:22:03,000 --> 02:22:05,000
in there I just they go into that parent portal and

3273
02:22:05,000 --> 02:22:07,000
I can show you some of the stuff he's been

3274
02:22:07,000 --> 02:22:09,000
working on

3275
02:22:09,000 --> 02:22:11,000
but it's cool it's

3276
02:22:11,000 --> 02:22:13,000
not not to make fun of him or anything

3277
02:22:13,000 --> 02:22:15,000
a lot of it's very obnoxious

3278
02:22:15,000 --> 02:22:17,000
it's a kid usually when we like

3279
02:22:17,000 --> 02:22:19,000
laugh at that stuff it's like oh my gosh I can't believe

3280
02:22:19,000 --> 02:22:21,000
what kids are doing I can't believe like what kids

3281
02:22:21,000 --> 02:22:23,000
like are are into but as far as

3282
02:22:23,000 --> 02:22:25,000
your own personal coding

3283
02:22:25,000 --> 02:22:27,000
uh you have he has yet to release

3284
02:22:27,000 --> 02:22:29,000
anything that uh is

3285
02:22:29,000 --> 02:22:31,000
is I did see the time to car

3286
02:22:31,000 --> 02:22:33,000
thing I did get to see that at one point

3287
02:22:33,000 --> 02:22:35,000
it's on YouTube oh yeah that's right you did put it

3288
02:22:35,000 --> 02:22:37,000
on YouTube it's on it's on my YouTube channel

3289
02:22:37,000 --> 02:22:39,000
uh YouTube Lokiolar

3290
02:22:39,000 --> 02:22:41,000
you can check it out it's really old the reason

3291
02:22:41,000 --> 02:22:43,000
I didn't release it because it wasn't fun

3292
02:22:43,000 --> 02:22:45,000
and I had I would have had to I wanted

3293
02:22:45,000 --> 02:22:47,000
to redo the whole thing

3294
02:22:47,000 --> 02:22:49,000
I just it kind of got like

3295
02:22:49,000 --> 02:22:51,000
it I lost the scope of what I was trying

3296
02:22:51,000 --> 02:22:53,000
to do with it and then

3297
02:22:53,000 --> 02:22:55,000
it just became too weird and

3298
02:22:55,000 --> 02:22:57,000
so I decided to um

3299
02:22:57,000 --> 02:22:59,000
I'm not gonna work on it until I have a clear idea

3300
02:22:59,000 --> 02:23:01,000
of what I'm gonna do so

3301
02:23:01,000 --> 02:23:03,000
I'm working on something else right now instead

3302
02:23:03,000 --> 02:23:05,000
all right well let's get to

3303
02:23:05,000 --> 02:23:07,000
some calls uh or at least a call because we do

3304
02:23:07,000 --> 02:23:09,000
have somebody uh waiting there in the green room

3305
02:23:09,000 --> 02:23:11,000
that wants to be on the show so let's bring them on

3306
02:23:11,000 --> 02:23:13,000
hello you're on Orange Laundry Radio who's this

3307
02:23:13,000 --> 02:23:15,000
you're out this is Metal Mayhem

3308
02:23:15,000 --> 02:23:17,000
well hello Metal Mayhem what's on your mind

3309
02:23:17,000 --> 02:23:19,000
tonight I just called you mayhem

3310
02:23:19,000 --> 02:23:21,000
I called you a may-ham

3311
02:23:21,000 --> 02:23:23,000
ham sorry about

3312
02:23:23,000 --> 02:23:25,000
it may-ham mayhem

3313
02:23:25,000 --> 02:23:27,000
well better than

3314
02:23:27,000 --> 02:23:29,000
June beef right

3315
02:23:29,000 --> 02:23:31,000
all right what's on your mind tonight

3316
02:23:31,000 --> 02:23:33,000
uh well since you

3317
02:23:33,000 --> 02:23:35,000
kind of sort of touched it on

3318
02:23:35,000 --> 02:23:37,000
briefly in passing now

3319
02:23:37,000 --> 02:23:39,000
a short while ago I thought I'd

3320
02:23:39,000 --> 02:23:41,000
call about arcade 1-up

3321
02:23:41,000 --> 02:23:43,000
um now

3322
02:23:43,000 --> 02:23:45,000
you know I haven't

3323
02:23:45,000 --> 02:23:47,000
seen these machines in person

3324
02:23:47,000 --> 02:23:49,000
myself but obviously

3325
02:23:49,000 --> 02:23:51,000
you and Loki and

3326
02:23:51,000 --> 02:23:53,000
uh Dark Soccer have so

3327
02:23:53,000 --> 02:23:55,000
um

3328
02:23:55,000 --> 02:23:57,000
my question is

3329
02:23:57,000 --> 02:23:59,000
for a little

3330
02:23:59,000 --> 02:24:01,000
exposition obviously I know they're gonna

3331
02:24:01,000 --> 02:24:03,000
be a little bit different than the

3332
02:24:03,000 --> 02:24:05,000
actual arcade originals

3333
02:24:05,000 --> 02:24:07,000
they're gonna be smaller chances are they

3334
02:24:07,000 --> 02:24:09,000
don't accept quarters

3335
02:24:09,000 --> 02:24:11,000
or tokens or anything like that

3336
02:24:11,000 --> 02:24:13,000
but even with that being said

3337
02:24:13,000 --> 02:24:15,000
now if you're

3338
02:24:15,000 --> 02:24:17,000
not in the position to get

3339
02:24:17,000 --> 02:24:19,000
the actual arcade machine for

3340
02:24:19,000 --> 02:24:21,000
one ever reason

3341
02:24:21,000 --> 02:24:23,000
you know would you recommend

3342
02:24:23,000 --> 02:24:25,000
you know people go out and get

3343
02:24:25,000 --> 02:24:27,000
these machines is like uh

3344
02:24:27,000 --> 02:24:29,000
alternative to the original machine

3345
02:24:29,000 --> 02:24:31,000
um

3346
02:24:31,000 --> 02:24:33,000
as an alternative to the original machine

3347
02:24:33,000 --> 02:24:35,000
it depends if you're a collector

3348
02:24:35,000 --> 02:24:37,000
I don't think anything's gonna replace the

3349
02:24:37,000 --> 02:24:39,000
original machine as far as like collector

3350
02:24:39,000 --> 02:24:41,000
value and goes but if you're just somebody

3351
02:24:41,000 --> 02:24:43,000
like looking to enhance your game

3352
02:24:43,000 --> 02:24:45,000
room or your fun space

3353
02:24:45,000 --> 02:24:47,000
like a like especially like maybe if you have

3354
02:24:47,000 --> 02:24:49,000
like a community game room if you have like a

3355
02:24:49,000 --> 02:24:51,000
HOA or an apartment complex or something has like

3356
02:24:51,000 --> 02:24:53,000
a standard game room and you're looking to like

3357
02:24:53,000 --> 02:24:55,000
enrich that a little bit I think one of these machines would be

3358
02:24:55,000 --> 02:24:57,000
really like an adorable way to do that now

3359
02:24:57,000 --> 02:24:59,000
since you haven't seen them in person but by the way

3360
02:24:59,000 --> 02:25:01,000
my well at least a local

3361
02:25:01,000 --> 02:25:03,000
Walmart to here has them on

3362
02:25:03,000 --> 02:25:05,000
display now I don't think that means

3363
02:25:05,000 --> 02:25:07,000
every Walmart has them on display

3364
02:25:07,000 --> 02:25:09,000
but I know one near here does so if you

3365
02:25:09,000 --> 02:25:11,000
have a large Walmart near to you somewhere

3366
02:25:11,000 --> 02:25:13,000
um you might be able to go and

3367
02:25:13,000 --> 02:25:15,000
uh see that so I

3368
02:25:15,000 --> 02:25:17,000
check that out and also um Costco

3369
02:25:17,000 --> 02:25:19,000
here sells them now I don't have

3370
02:25:19,000 --> 02:25:21,000
a Costco membership but somebody sent me

3371
02:25:21,000 --> 02:25:23,000
a text the other day going hey I thought

3372
02:25:23,000 --> 02:25:25,000
of you because I saw this at Costco so I know

3373
02:25:25,000 --> 02:25:27,000
they're selling them there too is Costco nationwide

3374
02:25:27,000 --> 02:25:29,000
nationwide or is that just west coast

3375
02:25:29,000 --> 02:25:31,000
they're nationwide okay they're nationwide so

3376
02:25:31,000 --> 02:25:33,000
check that too um

3377
02:25:33,000 --> 02:25:35,000
so you may be able to see one in person

3378
02:25:35,000 --> 02:25:37,000
if you if you head to one of those stores I imagine

3379
02:25:37,000 --> 02:25:39,000
they're going to be showing up more places soon

3380
02:25:39,000 --> 02:25:41,000
because there's really no describing it like seeing

3381
02:25:41,000 --> 02:25:43,000
one in person although you could probably see some YouTubes

3382
02:25:43,000 --> 02:25:45,000
and they probably do a good job at explaining

3383
02:25:45,000 --> 02:25:47,000
it as well um they are

3384
02:25:47,000 --> 02:25:49,000
smaller they're not like the original cabinet

3385
02:25:49,000 --> 02:25:51,000
um because I would say imagine

3386
02:25:51,000 --> 02:25:53,000
more like a bar top if you've ever been to

3387
02:25:53,000 --> 02:25:55,000
a bar and you see something that's like kind of like

3388
02:25:55,000 --> 02:25:57,000
sitting on top of the bar it's kind of more like

3389
02:25:57,000 --> 02:25:59,000
that but it's probably like

3390
02:25:59,000 --> 02:26:01,000
I would say it has a little more height to

3391
02:26:01,000 --> 02:26:03,000
it it kind of goes up a little bit it's a little more

3392
02:26:03,000 --> 02:26:05,000
skinnier like an arcade cabinet but it goes

3393
02:26:05,000 --> 02:26:07,000
up a little bit and then um you know it's

3394
02:26:07,000 --> 02:26:09,000
just not the size of a full size it's

3395
02:26:09,000 --> 02:26:11,000
meant to be put like on the bar

3396
02:26:11,000 --> 02:26:13,000
and then you sit there on a stool and play

3397
02:26:13,000 --> 02:26:15,000
the game that way it's not meant to be something you put on

3398
02:26:15,000 --> 02:26:17,000
the ground because if you put it on the ground it wouldn't

3399
02:26:17,000 --> 02:26:19,000
come up past your kneecaps okay

3400
02:26:19,000 --> 02:26:21,000
whereas the original arcade machine would come

3401
02:26:21,000 --> 02:26:23,000
up the full size um

3402
02:26:23,000 --> 02:26:25,000
the thing I noticed right off the bat

3403
02:26:25,000 --> 02:26:27,000
as being very different is the monitor

3404
02:26:27,000 --> 02:26:29,000
because they have a very kind of like

3405
02:26:29,000 --> 02:26:31,000
cheap but modern monitor

3406
02:26:31,000 --> 02:26:33,000
in there and I think one thing you have to remember

3407
02:26:33,000 --> 02:26:35,000
is that a lot of these games like Mortal

3408
02:26:35,000 --> 02:26:37,000
Combat like I don't know what are even

3409
02:26:37,000 --> 02:26:39,000
in these things Crystal Castles

3410
02:26:39,000 --> 02:26:41,000
like old school Asteroids, Tempest

3411
02:26:41,000 --> 02:26:43,000
those type of games they all played on

3412
02:26:43,000 --> 02:26:45,000
CRT televisions and that's not

3413
02:26:45,000 --> 02:26:47,000
what's powering these things these are like

3414
02:26:47,000 --> 02:26:49,000
flat screen TVs in those so

3415
02:26:49,000 --> 02:26:51,000
that's the first thing I noticed

3416
02:26:51,000 --> 02:26:53,000
that's different is that oh this looks

3417
02:26:53,000 --> 02:26:55,000
different because it's not like a CRT

3418
02:26:55,000 --> 02:26:57,000
which is a very kind of distinct look to

3419
02:26:57,000 --> 02:26:59,000
it versus you know a more modern

3420
02:26:59,000 --> 02:27:01,000
flat screen television so I think

3421
02:27:01,000 --> 02:27:03,000
for me right there that's like the biggest

3422
02:27:03,000 --> 02:27:05,000
difference you're going to notice but that's also

3423
02:27:05,000 --> 02:27:07,000
how they make these things not cost

3424
02:27:07,000 --> 02:27:09,000
a couple thousand dollars which

3425
02:27:09,000 --> 02:27:11,000
if you're a collector trying to collect a machine

3426
02:27:11,000 --> 02:27:13,000
I don't know Jamie you may know

3427
02:27:13,000 --> 02:27:15,000
more about this than I do I know you guys collect pinball

3428
02:27:15,000 --> 02:27:17,000
machines and not arcade machines but

3429
02:27:17,000 --> 02:27:19,000
do you have any idea like ballpark what an

3430
02:27:19,000 --> 02:27:21,000
80's arcade machine might cost somebody?

3431
02:27:21,000 --> 02:27:23,000
Depends on the machine I mean really

3432
02:27:23,000 --> 02:27:25,000
because it depends on rarity it depends

3433
02:27:25,000 --> 02:27:27,000
on if it is a mod

3434
02:27:27,000 --> 02:27:29,000
a lot of machines were modded and people

3435
02:27:29,000 --> 02:27:31,000
will buy the modded machines and try to

3436
02:27:31,000 --> 02:27:33,000
restore them back to original

3437
02:27:33,000 --> 02:27:35,000
when we picked up our pole position

3438
02:27:35,000 --> 02:27:37,000
now it was in shitty condition

3439
02:27:37,000 --> 02:27:39,000
but we picked up our pole position

3440
02:27:39,000 --> 02:27:41,000
for I want to say 200

3441
02:27:41,000 --> 02:27:43,000
that's not bad

3442
02:27:43,000 --> 02:27:45,000
yeah it was pretty crappy

3443
02:27:45,000 --> 02:27:47,000
I remember Shermie lived in it for a

3444
02:27:47,000 --> 02:27:49,000
little while remember yeah I do

3445
02:27:49,000 --> 02:27:51,000
I do and you guys put a main thing

3446
02:27:51,000 --> 02:27:53,000
in that right we did we did

3447
02:27:53,000 --> 02:27:55,000
we also now

3448
02:27:55,000 --> 02:27:57,000
keep in mind our gyrus was free

3449
02:27:57,000 --> 02:27:59,000
because it needed

3450
02:27:59,000 --> 02:28:01,000
a fuse replaced and the owner didn't want to do

3451
02:28:01,000 --> 02:28:03,000
it or you didn't know how to fix it

3452
02:28:03,000 --> 02:28:05,000
we got our blastroids

3453
02:28:05,000 --> 02:28:07,000
I want to say for 50 I mean

3454
02:28:07,000 --> 02:28:09,000
we've since sold both of these now

3455
02:28:09,000 --> 02:28:11,000
I think for 500 for the pair

3456
02:28:11,000 --> 02:28:13,000
because we needed room

3457
02:28:13,000 --> 02:28:15,000
but

3458
02:28:15,000 --> 02:28:17,000
I mean it just really depends

3459
02:28:17,000 --> 02:28:19,000
a good way actually

3460
02:28:19,000 --> 02:28:21,000
to learn some of these prices is a channel

3461
02:28:21,000 --> 02:28:23,000
that Dan and I watch is TNT Amusements

3462
02:28:23,000 --> 02:28:25,000
out on the East Coast

3463
02:28:25,000 --> 02:28:27,000
I'm trying to remember where exactly

3464
02:28:27,000 --> 02:28:29,000
but you know he'll go through

3465
02:28:29,000 --> 02:28:31,000
and he'll say what the prices you know they show some

3466
02:28:31,000 --> 02:28:33,000
of the repair process on some of the machines

3467
02:28:33,000 --> 02:28:35,000
and they talk about the pricing

3468
02:28:35,000 --> 02:28:37,000
and you know what a discounted price

3469
02:28:37,000 --> 02:28:39,000
would be and what he picks

3470
02:28:39,000 --> 02:28:41,000
up these things for and the work that goes into him

3471
02:28:41,000 --> 02:28:43,000
I get a really good

3472
02:28:43,000 --> 02:28:45,000
gauge just watching his YouTube

3473
02:28:45,000 --> 02:28:47,000
channel so

3474
02:28:47,000 --> 02:28:49,000
now I do want to respond

3475
02:28:49,000 --> 02:28:51,000
because I'm finally looking at chat and some of the

3476
02:28:51,000 --> 02:28:53,000
input you guys are making there first off

3477
02:28:53,000 --> 02:28:55,000
Costco is apparently not just nationwide

3478
02:28:55,000 --> 02:28:57,000
but it's in Mexico too according to Act F so it's

3479
02:28:57,000 --> 02:28:59,000
international so I really don't know what I'm talking about

3480
02:28:59,000 --> 02:29:01,000
and then

3481
02:29:01,000 --> 02:29:03,000
let's see S2100 Matt I thought had some good advice

3482
02:29:03,000 --> 02:29:05,000
here your best bet for getting machines

3483
02:29:05,000 --> 02:29:07,000
at a good price look for

3484
02:29:07,000 --> 02:29:09,000
auctions sometimes you'll get

3485
02:29:09,000 --> 02:29:11,000
a good deal I remember YYR

3486
02:29:11,000 --> 02:29:13,000
got his DDR machine for a good price

3487
02:29:13,000 --> 02:29:15,000
at an auction so that's

3488
02:29:15,000 --> 02:29:17,000
that's a good way to think about it too not that

3489
02:29:17,000 --> 02:29:19,000
I'm saying you're running out there to collect arcade machines

3490
02:29:19,000 --> 02:29:21,000
Metal Mayhem but you never you never know

3491
02:29:21,000 --> 02:29:23,000
especially sometimes it's just about

3492
02:29:23,000 --> 02:29:25,000
like who you know and what have you

3493
02:29:25,000 --> 02:29:27,000
just like Dark Tips

3494
02:29:27,000 --> 02:29:29,000
I'm sorry I'm looking for chat while I'm talking

3495
02:29:29,000 --> 02:29:31,000
Dark Sakura

3496
02:29:31,000 --> 02:29:33,000
I'm looking at chat while I'm

3497
02:29:33,000 --> 02:29:35,000
Dark Sakura mentioned

3498
02:29:35,000 --> 02:29:37,000
that they got a free one just because

3499
02:29:37,000 --> 02:29:39,000
you know lazy owner space

3500
02:29:39,000 --> 02:29:41,000
as far as the owner was concerned you'd be surprised

3501
02:29:41,000 --> 02:29:43,000
where you can find stuff I found my DDR

3502
02:29:43,000 --> 02:29:45,000
cabinet on Facebook marketplace

3503
02:29:45,000 --> 02:29:47,000
so yeah wow I got a great

3504
02:29:47,000 --> 02:29:49,000
deal on that

3505
02:29:49,000 --> 02:29:51,000
it's crazy

3506
02:29:51,000 --> 02:29:53,000
I did a little bit of

3507
02:29:53,000 --> 02:29:55,000
basic research for actual

3508
02:29:55,000 --> 02:29:57,000
arcade machines being

3509
02:29:57,000 --> 02:29:59,000
sold in my area

3510
02:29:59,000 --> 02:30:01,000
for those that don't remember

3511
02:30:01,000 --> 02:30:03,000
or are relatively new to the show

3512
02:30:03,000 --> 02:30:05,000
I live in the western New

3513
02:30:05,000 --> 02:30:07,000
York area

3514
02:30:07,000 --> 02:30:09,000
and you know

3515
02:30:09,000 --> 02:30:11,000
the cities in western

3516
02:30:11,000 --> 02:30:13,000
New York are nowhere as big as Sacramento

3517
02:30:13,000 --> 02:30:15,000
or LA or anything like that

3518
02:30:15,000 --> 02:30:17,000
so

3519
02:30:17,000 --> 02:30:19,000
my choices for

3520
02:30:19,000 --> 02:30:21,000
places that sell

3521
02:30:21,000 --> 02:30:23,000
are rather limited

3522
02:30:23,000 --> 02:30:25,000
and now the ones that I constantly

3523
02:30:25,000 --> 02:30:27,000
see being advertised

3524
02:30:27,000 --> 02:30:29,000
they have been restored and whatnot

3525
02:30:29,000 --> 02:30:31,000
typically regardless

3526
02:30:31,000 --> 02:30:33,000
of the machine

3527
02:30:33,000 --> 02:30:35,000
they're being sold for roughly two and a half

3528
02:30:35,000 --> 02:30:37,000
grand

3529
02:30:37,000 --> 02:30:39,000
as much as I would like an

3530
02:30:39,000 --> 02:30:41,000
actual

3531
02:30:41,000 --> 02:30:43,000
same working order and all that

3532
02:30:43,000 --> 02:30:45,000
two and a half bands way

3533
02:30:45,000 --> 02:30:47,000
out of my price range

3534
02:30:47,000 --> 02:30:49,000
so I kind of figure

3535
02:30:49,000 --> 02:30:51,000
if I can't do two and a half grand

3536
02:30:53,000 --> 02:30:55,000
if I remember right you said these

3537
02:30:55,000 --> 02:30:57,000
arcade one ups

3538
02:30:57,000 --> 02:30:59,000
are being sold for roughly

3539
02:30:59,000 --> 02:31:01,000
about two hundred dollars right?

3540
02:31:01,000 --> 02:31:03,000
I can't figure

3541
02:31:03,000 --> 02:31:05,000
two hundred dollars is still a little bit of a stretch

3542
02:31:05,000 --> 02:31:07,000
about two hundred dollars

3543
02:31:07,000 --> 02:31:09,000
is still

3544
02:31:09,000 --> 02:31:11,000
way more affordable

3545
02:31:11,000 --> 02:31:13,000
it's doable

3546
02:31:13,000 --> 02:31:15,000
it's about the same price

3547
02:31:15,000 --> 02:31:17,000
what a console would cost you

3548
02:31:17,000 --> 02:31:19,000
you're only going to get a handful of games

3549
02:31:19,000 --> 02:31:21,000
so they have to be games that really mean something to you

3550
02:31:21,000 --> 02:31:23,000
but it could be worth it

3551
02:31:23,000 --> 02:31:25,000
yeah

3552
02:31:25,000 --> 02:31:27,000
if I like

3553
02:31:27,000 --> 02:31:29,000
if I really

3554
02:31:29,000 --> 02:31:31,000
go

3555
02:31:31,000 --> 02:31:33,000
and save up

3556
02:31:33,000 --> 02:31:35,000
like living on nothing

3557
02:31:35,000 --> 02:31:37,000
but ramen and

3558
02:31:37,000 --> 02:31:39,000
air and water for like

3559
02:31:39,000 --> 02:31:41,000
years then maybe just

3560
02:31:41,000 --> 02:31:43,000
maybe with a little

3561
02:31:43,000 --> 02:31:45,000
luck maybe I can

3562
02:31:45,000 --> 02:31:47,000
pass away for the actual arcade machine

3563
02:31:47,000 --> 02:31:49,000
at like two and a half grand but

3564
02:31:49,000 --> 02:31:51,000
I wouldn't hold my breath on that

3565
02:31:51,000 --> 02:31:53,000
I don't think any

3566
02:31:53,000 --> 02:31:55,000
arcade machine is worth starving yourself

3567
02:31:55,000 --> 02:31:57,000
for but you know if you

3568
02:31:57,000 --> 02:31:59,000
you find things in your budget

3569
02:31:59,000 --> 02:32:01,000
to cut back on you'd be surprised

3570
02:32:01,000 --> 02:32:03,000
how long am I to err how

3571
02:32:03,000 --> 02:32:05,000
not so long am I taking to save for some things

3572
02:32:05,000 --> 02:32:07,000
you know what I mean

3573
02:32:07,000 --> 02:32:09,000
I mean you know the computer that I'm on

3574
02:32:09,000 --> 02:32:11,000
right now you know that was

3575
02:32:11,000 --> 02:32:13,000
relatively cheap but I literally

3576
02:32:13,000 --> 02:32:15,000
had to live on like a shoe sticking out

3577
02:32:15,000 --> 02:32:17,000
budget for like three months

3578
02:32:17,000 --> 02:32:19,000
to get to get the money for that and that was

3579
02:32:19,000 --> 02:32:21,000
only like roughly four hundred

3580
02:32:21,000 --> 02:32:23,000
fifty dollars so

3581
02:32:23,000 --> 02:32:25,000
yeah all right well

3582
02:32:25,000 --> 02:32:27,000
you know I took away too much of

3583
02:32:27,000 --> 02:32:29,000
the time so I'll clear up reliance for

3584
02:32:29,000 --> 02:32:31,000

02:33:07,000 --> 02:33:09,000
I'm doing great little under the weather but

3604
02:33:09,000 --> 02:33:11,000
yikes yeah

3605
02:33:11,000 --> 02:33:13,000
just I don't have anything

3606
02:33:13,000 --> 02:33:15,000
relevant topic wise to say but

3607
02:33:15,000 --> 02:33:17,000
just wanted to say you know I've been listening since I

3608
02:33:17,000 --> 02:33:19,000
was 15 back when RSS feeds

3609
02:33:19,000 --> 02:33:21,000
on the PSP were still a thing

3610
02:33:21,000 --> 02:33:23,000
I'm 28 now so

3611
02:33:23,000 --> 02:33:25,000
that kind of dates me a little bit there but

3612
02:33:25,000 --> 02:33:27,000
uh I think my first memory

3613
02:33:27,000 --> 02:33:29,000
of you all was uh when you weren't

3614
02:33:29,000 --> 02:33:31,000
mentioning how long you all have been on the air

3615
02:33:31,000 --> 02:33:33,000
or a podcast rather

3616
02:33:33,000 --> 02:33:35,000
and dark soccer held up her fingers and said

3617
02:33:35,000 --> 02:33:37,000
we're this many and you were all like oh

3618
02:33:37,000 --> 02:33:39,000
yeah great radio dark soccer

3619
02:33:39,000 --> 02:33:41,000
they're holding up your fingers

3620
02:33:41,000 --> 02:33:43,000
isn't isn't that ironic

3621
02:33:43,000 --> 02:33:45,000
now that we're on twitch so

3622
02:33:45,000 --> 02:33:47,000
dark soccer hold up how many fingers

3623
02:33:47,000 --> 02:33:49,000
with how old the show is

3624
02:33:49,000 --> 02:33:51,000
they can't see they can't see that no

3625
02:33:51,000 --> 02:33:53,000
we're more than one dark

3626
02:33:53,000 --> 02:33:55,000
multiply that by 17

3627
02:33:55,000 --> 02:33:57,000
all right

3628
02:33:57,000 --> 02:33:59,000
noted noted yeah

3629
02:33:59,000 --> 02:34:01,000
with love with love

3630
02:34:01,000 --> 02:34:03,000
I've called in and emailed

3631
02:34:03,000 --> 02:34:05,000
in under several different aliases

3632
02:34:05,000 --> 02:34:07,000
could never really stick to one so

3633
02:34:07,000 --> 02:34:09,000
this is one I actually can stick to

3634
02:34:09,000 --> 02:34:11,000
because I've had it since I was a teenager

3635
02:34:11,000 --> 02:34:13,000
but um yeah I mean

3636
02:34:13,000 --> 02:34:15,000
I've called I remember emailing in

3637
02:34:15,000 --> 02:34:17,000
one day when I was a teen and

3638
02:34:17,000 --> 02:34:19,000
real lonely angsty teen and how I

3639
02:34:19,000 --> 02:34:21,000
sent in an email stating how the show really

3640
02:34:21,000 --> 02:34:23,000
got me through the day when my dog died

3641
02:34:23,000 --> 02:34:25,000
stuff like that

3642
02:34:25,000 --> 02:34:27,000
I just uh

3643
02:34:27,000 --> 02:34:29,000
I just want to thank you all for uh

3644
02:34:29,000 --> 02:34:31,000
keeping at it for

3645
02:34:31,000 --> 02:34:33,000
this long too that's just

3646
02:34:33,000 --> 02:34:35,000
kind of unprecedented I mean

3647
02:34:35,000 --> 02:34:37,000
I kind of I kind of joke

3648
02:34:37,000 --> 02:34:39,000
about this sometimes but the story that

3649
02:34:39,000 --> 02:34:41,000
you kind of gave there is that like I've been

3650
02:34:41,000 --> 02:34:43,000
listening since I was 15 and now I'm 28

3651
02:34:43,000 --> 02:34:45,000
you know it's it's it's

3652
02:34:45,000 --> 02:34:47,000
like the best thing to hear at the same

3653
02:34:47,000 --> 02:34:49,000
time being the worst thing to hear

3654
02:34:49,000 --> 02:34:51,000
right yeah it's kind of uh

3655
02:34:51,000 --> 02:34:53,000
no but I love it I love

3656
02:34:53,000 --> 02:34:55,000
no I do I do like but the

3657
02:34:55,000 --> 02:34:57,000
fact that uh we just make fun of

3658
02:34:57,000 --> 02:34:59,000
it because it's obviously a reminder of like oh

3659
02:34:59,000 --> 02:35:01,000
yeah I was 24 when I started this and now

3660
02:35:01,000 --> 02:35:03,000
I'm um not

3661
02:35:03,000 --> 02:35:05,000
um but uh don't even

3662
02:35:05,000 --> 02:35:07,000
the the fact that

3663
02:35:07,000 --> 02:35:09,000
many of you have stuck with this as long

3664
02:35:09,000 --> 02:35:11,000
as you have I mean it's it's the reason

3665
02:35:11,000 --> 02:35:13,000
why we keep showing up on Sunday night you know

3666
02:35:13,000 --> 02:35:15,000
we're not we're not a huge show

3667
02:35:15,000 --> 02:35:17,000
we don't we don't got the ratings a giant

3668
02:35:17,000 --> 02:35:19,000
bomb or um I don't

3669
02:35:19,000 --> 02:35:21,000
what are even the big gaming podcast I don't even

3670
02:35:21,000 --> 02:35:23,000
know anymore a lot of them just kind of come

3671
02:35:23,000 --> 02:35:25,000
and go but anyway

3672
02:35:25,000 --> 02:35:27,000
because y'all are technically

3673
02:35:27,000 --> 02:35:29,000
first podcast I ever

3674
02:35:29,000 --> 02:35:31,000
listened to so I don't want to say

3675
02:35:31,000 --> 02:35:33,000
anything even remotely shady about gamertag

3676
02:35:33,000 --> 02:35:35,000
though because Danny was very hard at what he

3677
02:35:35,000 --> 02:35:37,000
does and deserves the success that

3678
02:35:37,000 --> 02:35:39,000
he's getting and he's another indie guy so like

3679
02:35:39,000 --> 02:35:41,000
I can't I can't shade or hate

3680
02:35:41,000 --> 02:35:43,000
on that in any single way uh

3681
02:35:43,000 --> 02:35:45,000
but I will always throw shade at the corporate people involved

3682
02:35:45,000 --> 02:35:47,000
um so uh

3683
02:35:47,000 --> 02:35:49,000
yeah but um gosh thank you

3684
02:35:49,000 --> 02:35:51,000
thank you so much for um just

3685
02:35:51,000 --> 02:35:53,000
being here and and uh

3686
02:35:53,000 --> 02:35:55,000
being with us and giving us the motivation

3687
02:35:55,000 --> 02:35:57,000
to show up like people people

3688
02:35:57,000 --> 02:35:59,000
often ask us like how do you keep

3689
02:35:59,000 --> 02:36:01,000
going for 17 years

3690
02:36:01,000 --> 02:36:03,000
and there's several different

3691
02:36:03,000 --> 02:36:05,000
well I mean you say

3692
02:36:05,000 --> 02:36:07,000
that well you say that tongue in cheek

3693
02:36:07,000 --> 02:36:09,000
but there's definitely a part of me that goes

3694
02:36:09,000 --> 02:36:11,000
like the Sunday nights when

3695
02:36:11,000 --> 02:36:13,000
OLR isn't here

3696
02:36:13,000 --> 02:36:15,000
when something pre-planned isn't

3697
02:36:15,000 --> 02:36:17,000
going on like um let's say like we had a show

3698
02:36:17,000 --> 02:36:19,000
cut out because of a technical issue or something like

3699
02:36:19,000 --> 02:36:21,000
I I really didn't want to take the show off but we had like a

3700
02:36:21,000 --> 02:36:23,000
technical issue or something um

3701
02:36:23,000 --> 02:36:25,000
and it just feels weird

3702
02:36:25,000 --> 02:36:27,000
I'm like sitting there going what do I do

3703
02:36:27,000 --> 02:36:29,000
I guess I'll watch Game of Thrones or something

3704
02:36:29,000 --> 02:36:31,000
no I'm not even that bored so you know

3705
02:36:31,000 --> 02:36:33,000
it's like I don't know what to do um

3706
02:36:33,000 --> 02:36:35,000
but just also the fact that there's so many

3707
02:36:35,000 --> 02:36:37,000
of you out there

3708
02:36:37,000 --> 02:36:39,000
and I say so many and again it's not

3709
02:36:39,000 --> 02:36:41,000
like thousands and thousands

3710
02:36:41,000 --> 02:36:43,000
it's maybe dozens and dozens

3711
02:36:43,000 --> 02:36:45,000
but that's still something to me

3712
02:36:45,000 --> 02:36:47,000
the fact that even one person

3713
02:36:47,000 --> 02:36:49,000
would like turn up and like

3714
02:36:49,000 --> 02:36:51,000
give a shit about our discussions

3715
02:36:51,000 --> 02:36:53,000
that we're having here and our stories

3716
02:36:53,000 --> 02:36:55,000
and our angles and things like that like that's just like

3717
02:36:55,000 --> 02:36:57,000
that's all the motivation in the world

3718
02:36:57,000 --> 02:36:59,000
and that's something that's kept this show being fed

3719
02:36:59,000 --> 02:37:01,000
for 17 years and we'll

3720
02:37:01,000 --> 02:37:03,000
keep the show being fed until

3721
02:37:03,000 --> 02:37:05,000
one day we just have

3722
02:37:05,000 --> 02:37:07,000
to pull the plug for whatever reason

3723
02:37:07,000 --> 02:37:09,000
whatever that reason may be that I don't want to think of yet

3724
02:37:09,000 --> 02:37:11,000
right you know I've dropped

3725
02:37:11,000 --> 02:37:13,000
in and out of several different podcasts

3726
02:37:13,000 --> 02:37:15,000
but this has been the one that I've

3727
02:37:15,000 --> 02:37:17,000
stuck with for 12 years now

3728
02:37:17,000 --> 02:37:19,000
I mean granted I'm never as

3729
02:37:19,000 --> 02:37:21,000
consistent as I would like to be

3730
02:37:21,000 --> 02:37:23,000
but you know

3731
02:37:23,000 --> 02:37:25,000
y'all have been my

3732
02:37:25,000 --> 02:37:27,000
getting me through

3733
02:37:27,000 --> 02:37:29,000
you know to my commute to work

3734
02:37:29,000 --> 02:37:31,000
and my commute home from where

3735
02:37:31,000 --> 02:37:33,000
you know just always

3736
02:37:33,000 --> 02:37:35,000
hearing your voices is a good thing

3737
02:37:35,000 --> 02:37:37,000
and you guys really put on a great show

3738
02:37:37,000 --> 02:37:39,000
and I just wanted to extend my gratitude

3739
02:37:39,000 --> 02:37:41,000
well thank you so so much it's like

I really do appreciate that thank you

3742

yeah if you can't listen every week it's like totally

3743
02:37:47,000 --> 02:37:49,000
okay like you know some people will say like

3744
02:37:49,000 --> 02:37:51,000
oh man I haven't been able to listen to

02:37:51,000 --> 02:37:53,000

02:37:53,000 --> 02:37:55,000

apology or something I'm here doing my

3749
02:37:59,000 --> 02:38:01,000
thing with with our soccer and Loki

3750
02:38:01,000 --> 02:38:03,000
and if you're able to make it out cool

3751
02:38:03,000 --> 02:38:05,000
if not hey it happens

3752
02:38:05,000 --> 02:38:07,000
but as I usually say at the end

3753
02:38:07,000 --> 02:38:09,000
of the show and I'll just kind of remind everybody of it now

3754
02:38:09,000 --> 02:38:11,000
if if OLR you decide one day it's

3755
02:38:11,000 --> 02:38:13,000
not really for you anymore for whatever reason I just

3756
02:38:13,000 --> 02:38:15,000
hope you support independent podcasts

3757
02:38:15,000 --> 02:38:17,000
and please please

3758
02:38:17,000 --> 02:38:19,000
please do not support celebrity

3759
02:38:19,000 --> 02:38:21,000
podcasts that want to charge you

3760
02:38:21,000 --> 02:38:23,000
$7.99 a month for the privilege

3761
02:38:23,000 --> 02:38:25,000
of being able to listen to it

3762
02:38:25,000 --> 02:38:27,000
that's all I'm going to say for the record

3763
02:38:27,000 --> 02:38:29,000
if you do decide the podcast is no longer

3764
02:38:29,000 --> 02:38:31,000
for you would like to know why

3765
02:38:31,000 --> 02:38:33,000
honestly enough because

3766
02:38:33,000 --> 02:38:35,000
I'm a firm believer that a complaint is a gift

3767
02:38:35,000 --> 02:38:37,000
and if you

3768
02:38:37,000 --> 02:38:39,000
have a problem with something that we do or say

3769
02:38:39,000 --> 02:38:41,000
it'd be better to tell us right off the bat

3770
02:38:41,000 --> 02:38:43,000
hopefully you know where we can discuss

3771
02:38:43,000 --> 02:38:45,000
it so that you know

3772
02:38:45,000 --> 02:38:47,000
we know what people

3773
02:38:47,000 --> 02:38:49,000
aren't liking but to be clear

3774
02:38:49,000 --> 02:38:51,000
because I have read some of those like iTunes reviews

3775
02:38:51,000 --> 02:38:53,000
and things like that those don't count yeah things like

3776
02:38:53,000 --> 02:38:55,000
Dark Soccer is a bitch

3777
02:38:55,000 --> 02:38:57,000
or have there been more of those

3778
02:38:57,000 --> 02:38:59,000
Rob not in years or

3779
02:38:59,000 --> 02:39:01,000
Rob is annoying or whatever

3780
02:39:01,000 --> 02:39:03,000
Loki is too loud or

3781
02:39:03,000 --> 02:39:05,000
you play too much Pokemon Go like those things

3782
02:39:05,000 --> 02:39:07,000
aren't going to help you know what I mean

3783
02:39:07,000 --> 02:39:09,000
whatever yeah not very

3784
02:39:09,000 --> 02:39:11,000
constructive criticism but it's

3785
02:39:11,000 --> 02:39:13,000
also glad to hear that Dark Soccer is still

3786
02:39:13,000 --> 02:39:15,000
playing Animal Crossing

3787
02:39:15,000 --> 02:39:17,000
I'd like to think that Loki is still modding

3788
02:39:17,000 --> 02:39:19,000
the shit out of GTA 5 or something

3789
02:39:19,000 --> 02:39:21,000
um something

3790
02:39:21,000 --> 02:39:23,000
I love my Animal Crossing

3791
02:39:23,000 --> 02:39:25,000
though I'm so waiting for the Switch one

3792
02:39:25,000 --> 02:39:27,000
right

3793
02:39:27,000 --> 02:39:29,000
well uh that's really all I wanted to say guys

3794
02:39:29,000 --> 02:39:31,000
so just keep kicking ass

3795
02:39:57,000 --> 02:39:59,000
you're not already a hologram?

3796
02:39:59,000 --> 02:40:01,000
alright I'll show you hologram

3797
02:40:01,000 --> 02:40:03,000
take care shmaktastic thanks for being here

3798
02:40:03,000 --> 02:40:05,000
later

3799
02:40:05,000 --> 02:40:07,000
that was great

3800
02:40:07,000 --> 02:40:09,000
alright I think we'll end on that note

3801
02:40:09,000 --> 02:40:11,000
we're going to end on a happy note tonight

3802
02:40:11,000 --> 02:40:13,000
although I will ask Loki if there's any other

3803
02:40:13,000 --> 02:40:15,000
last minute stories he wants to see tonight

3804
02:40:15,000 --> 02:40:17,000
nah I've been just watching videos of this

3805
02:40:17,000 --> 02:40:19,000
of Dreams

3806
02:40:19,000 --> 02:40:21,000
the medium molecules posting

3807
02:40:21,000 --> 02:40:23,000
little big planet but PS4

3808
02:40:23,000 --> 02:40:25,000
yeah the stuff that people are doing in like the

3809
02:40:25,000 --> 02:40:27,000
past right now this game is going to

3810
02:40:27,000 --> 02:40:29,000
catch a lot of people off guard it looks

3811
02:40:29,000 --> 02:40:31,000
amazing I can't wait to play it but I feel

3812
02:40:31,000 --> 02:40:33,000
like this they're not really

3813
02:40:33,000 --> 02:40:35,000
explaining like when the game comes out I

3814
02:40:35,000 --> 02:40:37,000
feel like it's like this secret thing

3815
02:40:37,000 --> 02:40:39,000
that like you have to be part of the cool kids club to

3816
02:40:39,000 --> 02:40:41,000
know like when when when can I walk

3817
02:40:41,000 --> 02:40:43,000
into a target and buy

3818
02:40:43,000 --> 02:40:45,000
the fucking game that's what I would like to

3819
02:40:45,000 --> 02:40:47,000
know I don't know but it looks

3820
02:40:47,000 --> 02:40:49,000
it looks awesome yeah it does look

3821
02:40:49,000 --> 02:40:51,000
awesome like I'm all here for it but like

3822
02:40:51,000 --> 02:40:53,000
you know let me buy your game

3823
02:40:53,000 --> 02:40:55,000
that's all I'm asking I'm sure we'll

3824
02:40:55,000 --> 02:40:57,000
see it at E3 well maybe

3825
02:40:57,000 --> 02:40:59,000
cause Sony's not there

3826
02:40:59,000 --> 02:41:01,000
so they might put something out

3827
02:41:01,000 --> 02:41:03,000
they can just show this for the whole presentation

3828
02:41:03,000 --> 02:41:05,000
alongside it I don't know they might do a

3829
02:41:05,000 --> 02:41:07,000
direct-ish style thing

3830
02:41:07,000 --> 02:41:09,000
I don't know we'll see anyway

3831
02:41:09,000 --> 02:41:11,000
that does bring us to the end of another

3832
02:41:11,000 --> 02:41:13,000
episode of Orange Lawn Radio but we want to thank you

3833
02:41:13,000 --> 02:41:15,000

3834
02:41:15,000 --> 02:41:17,000
thank you for listening to our show and

3835
02:41:17,000 --> 02:41:19,000
as we were saying there on that call if you enjoyed

3836
02:41:19,000 --> 02:41:21,000
the show you know

3837
02:41:21,000 --> 02:41:23,000
well actually I said if you don't enjoy the show what to do

3838
02:41:23,000 --> 02:41:25,000
but if you do enjoy the show please

3839
02:41:25,000 --> 02:41:27,000
tell a friend help us spread the word because we are the

3840
02:41:27,000 --> 02:41:29,000
show where every gamer has a voice but if the voices

3841
02:41:29,000 --> 02:41:31,000
aren't here we can't air them

3842
02:41:31,000 --> 02:41:33,000
auto hosts on Twitch

3843
02:41:33,000 --> 02:41:35,000
TV for VoG network go a long

3844
02:41:35,000 --> 02:41:37,000
way we super appreciate those

3845
02:41:37,000 --> 02:41:39,000
if you consider adding VoG network to your auto host list

3846
02:41:39,000 --> 02:41:41,000
a nice five star review wherever

3847
02:41:41,000 --> 02:41:43,000
you found this show whether it be

3848
02:41:43,000 --> 02:41:45,000
iTunes or Google podcast or wherever

3849
02:41:45,000 --> 02:41:47,000
all of those really really go

3850
02:41:47,000 --> 02:41:49,000
a long way and we super appreciate it

3851
02:41:49,000 --> 02:41:51,000
I guess that's all we

3852
02:41:51,000 --> 02:41:53,000
have to say on that end so let's go around and get everybody's

3853
02:41:53,000 --> 02:41:55,000
final thought

3854
02:41:55,000 --> 02:41:57,000
DarkSakura why don't we start with you your final thought tonight

3855
02:41:59,000 --> 02:42:01,000
I don't think I

3856
02:42:01,000 --> 02:42:03,000
have one just people need to learn that

3857
02:42:03,000 --> 02:42:05,000
communication is very important that's all

3858
02:42:05,000 --> 02:42:07,000
and Loki your final

3859
02:42:07,000 --> 02:42:09,000
thought my final thought

3860
02:42:09,000 --> 02:42:11,000
is I'm going to try to stream something

3861
02:42:11,000 --> 02:42:13,000
this week because I've got a lot of opportunity to do that

3862
02:42:13,000 --> 02:42:15,000
so we'll see

3863
02:42:15,000 --> 02:42:17,000
and my final thought tonight is

3864
02:42:17,000 --> 02:42:19,000
I don't have a lot to say

3865
02:42:19,000 --> 02:42:21,000
I'm grateful we have

3866
02:42:21,000 --> 02:42:23,000
new microphones there's hopefully we all

3867
02:42:23,000 --> 02:42:25,000
sounded good tonight and that

3868
02:42:25,000 --> 02:42:27,000
that was a worthy investment and

3869
02:42:27,000 --> 02:42:29,000
thank you all for being here I think that

3870
02:42:29,000 --> 02:42:31,000
last call just really summed it up perfectly

3871
02:42:31,000 --> 02:42:33,000
it was a very feel good fuzzy way to end the

3872
02:42:33,000 --> 02:42:35,000
show tonight thank you guys so much for being here and being

3873
02:42:35,000 --> 02:42:37,000

as we come up on

3875
02:42:39,000 --> 02:42:41,000
episode 777 which

3876
02:42:41,000 --> 02:42:43,000
I guess is a landmark of sorts because

3877
02:42:43,000 --> 02:42:45,000
it is that show that we joked

3878
02:42:45,000 --> 02:42:47,000
about in the early days of O.L.R. we're not going to get

3879
02:42:47,000 --> 02:42:49,000

3880
02:42:49,000 --> 02:42:51,000
