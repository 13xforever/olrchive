27000	32000	Orange Lounge Radio
32000	37000	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
37000	45000	It is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight with episode number 782 for this June the 30th of 2019.
45000	50000	My name is Rob Roberts and joining me tonight, Techmaster Loki here in studio.
50000	51000	Hello.
51000	52000	Hi, how are you?
52000	53000	I'm very full.
53000	54000	You're very full?
54000	58000	Yes, I had some katsudon before the show started.
58000	61000	It looked like a baby threw up in that plate and you ate it.
61000	64000	It looked much better on Friday when it had the same thing.
64000	74000	It's supposed to be just like pork cutlets that are breaded and fried and then they do onions and carrots and then there's a scrambled egg over the top.
74000	80000	All that smelly stuff and I'm surprised, Mr. Smoosh, my dear kitty is not out here going meow meow meow and smelling all that stuff.
80000	85000	But seriously, it looked like my cat had vomited into rice and then that was what I was eating.
85000	86000	But it was delicious vomit.
86000	91000	Sometimes food that doesn't look appetizing actually ends up being really freaking appetizing.
91000	92000	It is good.
92000	100000	It's so good that I've been craving it since I had it on Friday and so I bought some today and then I also bought the stuff to make it at home for this week.
100000	102000	So, are we having it again?
102000	103000	I don't know.
103000	104000	Alright.
104000	106000	Well, it's a little bit of a weird show tonight.
106000	109000	Not joining us tonight is Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers.
109000	110000	She has the night off.
110000	112000	She is attending San Francisco Pride.
112000	121000	As she's mentioned on the show before, she's a member of the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence and this is a big, big weekend for the sisters, certainly in Northern California as well as other places.
121000	124000	So, there was a lot of Pride celebrations around the world this weekend.
124000	126000	So, I know I said it at the beginning of the month, but you know what?
126000	127000	I'll say it one more time here.
127000	131000	At the end of the month, these things are winding down with the celebrations.
131000	133000	Happy Pride to everybody out there.
133000	138000	And yeah, you know, it's one of those things that hopefully doesn't go away once June is over.
138000	146000	But I think we've made a lot of wonderful, wonderful progress in the past 50 years since Stonewall, but there's still so much further to go.
146000	152000	I'm going to try not to soapbox too much tonight because I know we want to get into video games, but that is certainly on my mind a lot.
152000	155000	So, Dark Sakura will be joining us again next week.
155000	158000	And Jason, you may have noticed, was absent from the intro.
158000	165000	So, you've got a very rare, I can't, it's been years since we've had one of these intros because, and I'll tell you why I didn't do it either.
165000	168000	So, Jason, he was at the Summer Games down quick.
168000	169000	Yeah.
169000	172000	So, he was, he's traveling today because that just wrapped up.
172000	175000	So, he's, we will talk about that later in the show.
175000	179000	I know many of you were watching and I do have a spot to talk about later in the show, don't worry.
179000	184000	And Jason's traveling, so he was unable to do, he kind of was at a spot.
184000	191000	He thought he might be at a spot where he kind of like pull over, record it, but he kind of couldn't do it because I got him the stuff late because,
191000	195000	and I couldn't do it because I was out of town last night. I went to a concert.
195000	203000	So, I went to see Carly Slay Jepsen, who I think a lot of people probably, I don't know, some people know, some people don't.
203000	207000	But Carly Rae Jepsen is, I think she got big through Canadian Idol.
207000	213000	I don't know if I want to say she's like the Kelly Clarkson of Canada because I'm opening myself up to Well Actuallys.
213000	218000	But she's had a pretty good career ever since she did Canadian Idol. Her biggest hit was Call Me Maybe.
218000	221000	That song got memed to hell, right? Everybody had that whole thing.
221000	227000	But the thing, the gag is, if you actually listen to some of her later stuff, like some of her other albums like Emotion and stuff,
227000	233000	like for me, like there's some really like solid like pop like anthems on there. It's really like infectious.
233000	239000	Like it's just kind of like, oh. So, it was good. It was like a late birthday present because my birthday obviously was this past week.
239000	244000	Allen's is coming up. So, we splurged. We did VIP. We got to do the meet and greet.
244000	249000	So, she was really sweet and all that. It was great. She complimented my shirt.
249000	253000	Not this one, obviously, but I was wearing one with cats on it. So, she thought it was cool.
253000	258000	So, yeah, that was my little Carly Rae story. So, but that was in Reno.
258000	264000	So, we drove up to Reno to do that. We could have gone to San Francisco, but I figured with pride in San Francisco this weekend,
264000	271000	that means traffic. That means impossible to park. Whereas, I'm thinking in Reno, I'm like all the casinos have free parking
271000	276000	because they want you to go there. And sure enough, it was easy peasy going to Reno.
276000	283000	So, in the theater, they did it out there as brand new. So, long story short, I was in Reno up until like a few hours ago.
283000	287000	We got back from Reno. So, I had to kind of abbreviate my show prep tonight.
287000	296000	So, speaking of concerts, Bobby Blackwolf, who's usually on before us at the Voice Geeks Network at vognetwork.com
296000	301000	because we do tape every night. No, we do not tape every night. We'd be tired.
301000	308000	We do tape every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Blackwolf show usually.
308000	314000	But he is off this week because he is at a Weird Al Yankovic concert.
314000	319000	So, I have Carly Rae Jefferson. He has Weird Al Yankovic. But I think Weird Al is really cool.
319000	324000	And honestly, a worthy reason to miss the show for a night. He's earned a night off.
324000	329000	So, that's where he's at tonight. So, he didn't have a show tonight. So, yeah, it's like a weird night all over the place.
329000	336000	Like three people usually involved with Sunday nights are gone MIA. I almost kind of decided to call off the show tonight.
336000	342000	But you know I don't like missing a lot of shows. I feel like there's enough for us to talk about with you guys in our chatroom
342000	346000	over at twitch.tv slash vog network.
346000	351000	Dartutuja says, it didn't seem like there was too much news anyway, at least outside the GDQ stuff.
351000	357000	Yeah, it does seem like things are really quiet this week. And I don't know if that's still kind of like the post E3 kind of slumber or what's going on there.
357000	364000	I think it's post E3 because we're just a few weeks away from what was it?
364000	370000	Gamescom, which is another like big announcement space. So, you know, I don't want to like announce too much stuff in between then
370000	372000	because then when are you going to announce it? Gamescom.
372000	378000	Plus a lot of stuff has just like come out. You know, now we're kind of getting into that summer release window
378000	382000	because you know the schools everywhere I'm from, it's a good time to release games.
382000	384000	But it's actually really light usually.
384000	389000	I feel like I'm so behind right now. Like I have not played nearly as many games as I should be.
389000	396000	And I'll get into why that is a little later. But I know Bloodstained came out and I need to get on that, that's for sure.
396000	401000	I have my Switch version, although I've heard there's some issues. We'll talk about that later in the show.
401000	403000	Mario Maker 2 for sure.
403000	406000	I did pick that up. I haven't played it. My kids played it.
406000	409000	Tell us more later during the game week.
409000	412000	And then what else? There's another one that came out.
412000	417000	Oh, Final Fantasy XIV's expansion, which I suppose will lead us into tonight's kickoff topic.
417000	420000	So Final Fantasy XIV's expansion released this week.
420000	424000	So Shadowbringers is the brand new expansion and it launched.
424000	429000	I guess the early access happened on Friday and technically the game's actual launch is Tuesday.
429000	438000	But for most MMO players, I'm pretty sure the Final Fantasy XIV fans, a big majority of them preordered Shadowbringers.
438000	441000	Just because they know they're going to buy it anyway is where I'm at.
441000	445000	And so you have that three or four day early access into Shadowbringers.
445000	453000	So it's been up since Friday. It sounds like it hasn't had quite the chaotic issues that some of the other launches had for Final Fantasy XIV.
453000	458000	So that's been a good thing. Like there was not errors where people were trying to get into a cutscene and they couldn't.
458000	460000	Because that was a big thing that happened with Stormblood.
460000	465000	It does sound like the servers got DDoSed at one point, or at least that's what Square Enix claims happens.
465000	468000	So there was some problems there. Some big login queues.
468000	472000	But, you know, kind of, I guess par for the course with MMO launches.
472000	476000	I suppose as far as most MMO launches go, it could have been a lot worse.
476000	481000	And then, and we'll get into more on Final Fantasy XIV here in a minute.
481000	486000	But speaking of the game releases, the Harry Potter game a lot of people are still talking about.
486000	489000	I know we went into that in depth last week and I don't want to rehash too much.
489000	493000	But I know a lot of people are still, you know, out there finding the foundables.
493000	495000	Finding the findables.
495000	498000	And some of my friends in Reno that I hung out with this weekend.
498000	503000	So the other reason why it was nice to go to Reno is because I have friends up there that I don't get to see as often as maybe the ones in San Francisco.
503000	507000	So I went up to Reno and one of my friends there was like, oh yeah, I'm playing that Harry Potter game. I love it.
507000	515000	And I mentioned that I played Ingress and I was like, you have like a little picnic area like right by where you live that probably would be in Ingress.
515000	518000	Do you want me to submit that so you have like a Harry Potter thing by your house?
518000	521000	He's like, oh my gosh, yes, would you? So I did. I sent it.
521000	523000	So we'll see if it goes, fingers crossed, if it goes through or not.
523000	532000	But yeah, he's all into the Harry Potter game, which is interesting because I thought most people were kind of just detouring from Pokemon Go for that.
532000	536000	But I don't know, maybe Harry Potter has its own audience. I'm not sure.
536000	539000	Probably. There's still a lot of crossover, I would think.
539000	543000	Harry Potter had a big event on Saturday though, but so did Pokemon Go.
543000	545000	So Harry Potter had an event in the morning.
545000	552000	Like, I don't think, I don't know if I would call it their version of a community day, but they did a little thing for a few hours where it was like increased spawns and all this stuff.
552000	557000	And then Pokemon Go had their Raikou raids because we could see them go.
557000	562000	We were like at the casino, like waiting to get into the VIP thing for Carly Rae.
562000	566000	And we could see like, you could see the gyms like on the outside of the casino, but they were nowhere near us.
566000	569000	And we're like, well, guess we're missing Raikou day.
569000	573000	But it sounds like a lot more people were getting shinies, like they increased the percentage.
573000	576000	I know I was keeping an eye on our Discord at vognetwork.com slash Discord.
576000	578000	We actually have a Pokemon Go channel because enough of you play it.
578000	583000	And I was like, a lot of people were saying they've got multiple shinies on the Raikou days. That's cool.
583000	588000	I just feel like I feel like I'm getting that point where I'm like, oh, I'm slipping on Pokemon Go and I'm falling behind.
588000	594000	And I don't know if it's like, am I going to allow myself to just completely fall off the wagon or what's going to happen?
594000	599000	And the fact that Harry Potter is like the new kid on the block doesn't help that situation.
599000	600000	I don't know.
601000	604000	ActDeftInChat says, a friend in our group didn't get a shiny though.
604000	607000	Well, but isn't that why the rest of you get three and four shinies?
607000	609000	Like, so you can trade?
609000	612000	I mean, maybe not right away, maybe the next, because what?
612000	615000	They're going to do one for the fire guy and the ice guy, right?
615000	618000	I know you have to meet certain criteria, but they're going to do it.
618000	619000	You know, they're going to do it.
619000	621000	They'll find a way to do it.
621000	626000	So then the concept is, I guess, if you don't get any of the fire guy, but then your friend gets three of those, you trade.
626000	628000	That's what Pokemon is all about, right?
628000	629000	Yeah.
629000	633000	Hopefully someone will take pity on me and trade a Riku to me at some point.
633000	635000	I'm not, I'm getting to the point where I'm not that torn up about it.
635000	637000	I'm like, Oh, damn, I missed it.
637000	640000	Those shinies are just taking up my inventory space anyway.
640000	641000	All right.
641000	642000	Anyway.
642000	644000	Well, you can get your shinies for the Lowens right now, can't you?
644000	645000	Yeah.
645000	646000	That's the whole thing going on too.
646000	652000	Anyway, it was supposed to be a kickoff about Final Fantasy 14, but it turned into multiplayer game discussion across the board.
652000	655000	So it's, I mean, in a way it is a busy summer.
655000	664000	These are things that people are doing this summer and maybe why the news is not so like, you know, huge headlines, you know, things we have to urgently talk about.
664000	669000	But we have a few stories this week about, um, games going to TV.
669000	671000	So do you want to take this or you want me to do it?
671000	672000	We can talk about it.
672000	678000	So Sony announced that they're going to be bringing Final Fantasy 14 to TV as like a Final Fantasy TV series.
678000	680000	That's kind of unexpected.
681000	682000	Yeah.
682000	685000	Like I'm, I'm really pleasantly surprised about this.
685000	691000	I'm curious to see what it's like, but, um, I definitely wasn't expecting them to do that.
691000	701000	So it's going to be, I guess, a collaboration between Sony Pictures Television and Hive Mind Entertainment, which has done, or is going to be doing the adaptation of The Witcher.
701000	706000	And I guess there's a show called The Expanse on Amazon that they also helm as well.
706000	707000	Oh, that show.
707000	710000	There's a lot of nerdy geeky fans of that show.
710000	711000	I see a lot of it on Twitter.
711000	717000	Um, don't they have nudity on that show in The Expanse or am I confusing them with another show?
717000	719000	Somebody in chat knows.
719000	720000	Fess up.
720000	725000	It's going to be so much shipping on the Final Fantasy show.
725000	726000	I know.
726000	728000	I'm like, you can do anything we want.
728000	729000	It's Netflix.
729000	731000	Well, I don't even know if it's going to be on Netflix.
731000	733000	It didn't say what platform they're playing.
733000	735000	I might be confusing them with another sci-fi show.
735000	736000	Uh, but, you know.
736000	738000	Are we going to get outed as a total perv?
738000	747000	Uh, yeah, no real word other than, you know, what it's, it's going to be a struggle between magic and technology.
747000	749000	All the games, basically.
749000	752000	Uh, to bring peace to a landing conflict.
752000	753000	All of the games.
753000	755000	It's basically like all of the games.
755000	761000	Um, Tiger Claw in our chat says a live action series to be exact, and I think that is an important thing to note.
761000	763000	That is not CGI or cartoon or something.
763000	765000	That is a live action series.
765000	773000	Um, and a lot of people talking about, oh, they've kind of done one already with the Dad of Light series that is on, um, Netflix.
773000	781000	But in that show, and disclaimer, I haven't watched it, but, you know, just kind of been following what it was all about and the stories on that and the people that have seen it.
781000	788000	My understanding is that Final Fantasy XIV is a little bit more of a plot device where the show is really about this father and son relationship.
788000	794000	But the game is something that they kind of use to understand their own relationship.
794000	798000	Whereas this is different because this is the game as a show.
798000	801000	This is not a plot device for something else.
801000	806000	And it's great because then maybe I'll understand what's going on with Final Fantasy XIV and then I can play the game, right?
806000	808000	Is that, that's the goal.
808000	812000	Okay, so we obviously have two very different kind of, you know, between you and I tonight.
812000	814000	I play a lot of Final Fantasy XIV.
814000	816000	I played shitty 1.0.
816000	820000	I've played since the alpha of Realm Reborn and so forth.
820000	822000	And I've continued to play the game and I really enjoy it.
822000	825000	Um, you played very little of the beta.
825000	829000	Yeah, you played very little of the beta because you were a big fan of XI.
829000	833000	But you were like, no more monthly fee games pretty much, right?
833000	836000	Yeah, I can't really do that because it's just, I don't play enough.
836000	844000	And I think there's a lot of people in your boat where like people are like, I would play Final Fantasy XIV if I didn't have to pay every month to play it.
844000	846000	I think there's a lot of people in that boat.
846000	852000	Um, but I can tell you as somebody who does play the game and I kind of justify the monthly fee.
852000	862000	Although I realize it's feeling a little more dated as, you know, we have so much more like free to play stuff with it's powered by, you know, cosmetic items and things like that.
862000	870000	But I kind of justify the monthly expense because I feel like they've been really good about regularly patching the content like every few months.
870000	873000	It's like you get this new DLC if you want to say it that way.
873000	878000	They call it patches in the MMO world, especially new dungeons, new things to explore, new parts of the story.
878000	881000	So it's like they're doing DLC every few months.
881000	884000	And so I go, okay, well, it's expensive DLC, but I'm kind of paying for that.
884000	888000	And just the fact that, you know, it isn't always online game.
888000	898000	But to that effect though, so are a lot of these other games as service games like Destiny 2 and stuff like that are doing regular content updates as well.
898000	901000	So it's like it's not really exclusive to them.
901000	907000	I would also just rather pay the honest, you know, twelve ninety five or whatever.
907000	910000	I'm actually paying quarterly, so I don't even know how much I pay, but whatever it is a monthly.
910000	919000	I would rather pay that honest fee up front than like get fucked over by loot boxes like the last Star Wars battle.
919000	923000	So, yeah, I would rather it just be an honest like this is how much we want to charge.
923000	926000	See, if it was an EA game, they'd be charging at twelve ninety five a month.
926000	929000	Plus the loot boxes as well in there.
929000	937000	Black Mama 1977 in our chat with a sad but important point that they never finished out of light because the dad in the show passed away.
937000	940000	And, you know, so, you know, that show can't really continue.
940000	943000	You know, I highly doubt they're going to continue it with a different actor or anything.
943000	946000	So it's time to go somewhere else with Final Fantasy 14.
946000	949000	But again, you know, this is going to be something that's actually set in the universe.
949000	954000	And so but it is not an adaptation of the story in game right now, is my understanding.
954000	958000	It's going to be in the universe, but it's going to be like a different story.
958000	962000	And I don't know if it's like prequel or any of that.
962000	964000	I don't know if they're saying a lot about that.
964000	969000	Act deft and chat over Twitch TV slash Vogue Network is very excited about live action chocobos.
969000	973000	So I know that's that's a thing that people be looking for.
973000	975000	Well, it's all going to be like CG stuff.
975000	977000	I mean, they're going to. Sure.
977000	983000	We have like the computer anime movie that they did for 13 not too long goes.
983000	987000	Oh, no, 15, not 13, 15.
987000	993000	So, yeah, the CGI technology is there to have real people writing, you know, the fake chocobos.
993000	995000	They're not going to do it all the time.
995000	997000	It's going to be one of those like big moments in the show.
997000	1000000	And then they're not going to have people writing chocobos like all the time.
1000000	1002000	I doubt we'll see. I don't know.
1002000	1005000	I'd be curious to see what service this is going to be on.
1005000	1010000	Oh, if you think it's going to end up being a Netflix thing or heaven forbid, is Sony going to launch their own service?
1010000	1013000	Well, they have crackle, right? Or whatever it is they have.
1013000	1019000	Well, not as a crackle, but they have like they're they've tried to do TV shows on the PlayStation stuff before.
1019000	1027000	Remember, there's the whole that was it the tester was that was called or I don't I can't see this being a PlayStation Network exclusive.
1027000	1029000	It's just not going to get enough eyes unless.
1029000	1032000	OK, y'all y'all want a tinfoil hat.
1032000	1041000	What if they're doing something with PlayStation five where they're going to as much as the whole like TV, TV, TV, sports, sports, TV, TV.
1041000	1042000	And look how well that worked for Microsoft.
1042000	1046000	But what if they're kind of planning to do something on PlayStation five?
1046000	1054000	Where maybe this will be one of the offerings that they put out there, like if you get a PlayStation five, you have access to Sony TV.
1054000	1060000	That's going to have these other shows like now a PlayStation plus included with your plus membership.
1060000	1070000	And then my reaction will be, oh, no, I can only watch it if I buy a PlayStation five, except the Internet exists, and therefore I will pirate it.
1070000	1075000	Or like what's happening to Star Trek Discovery in other countries.
1075000	1080000	It's on Netflix, so they don't have to worry about the whole CBS all access thing like we do here in the States.
1081000	1092000	The second season, which I haven't finished, but the second season is like apparently like if you thought the first season was not Star Trek enough, the second season will address your concerns.
1092000	1094000	That's what I'm told without sounding.
1094000	1098000	I don't know. I've seen some clips that look pretty cringy.
1098000	1101000	OK, but you can go back to old Star Trek and there's a lot of clips that look really cringy.
1101000	1103000	Yeah, but there's different there's different cringe.
1103000	1107000	There's cringe like, you know, it's old and that's kind of how we did things and stuff.
1107000	1115000	Then there's cringe like where we're taking CSI type, you know, technobabble and throwing it into Star Trek.
1115000	1116000	And it's just weird.
1116000	1119000	It's always the starboard power coupling. Am I right, guys?
1119000	1120000	I read that show. All right.
1120000	1125000	Some other comments from chat pod culture reminding us Powers was the other show on PlayStation.
1125000	1128000	That was the year I was at Sony's press conference, the year they unveiled that.
1128000	1129000	I should know that better.
1129000	1131000	That's right. Yeah, I didn't care about that.
1131000	1133000	Yeah, I think a lot of people forgot about that.
1133000	1135000	Oops. Let's see.
1135000	1140000	Also, Tiger Claw talking about the Final Fantasy 14 show in our chat saying, I'm curious about the production value.
1140000	1144000	It's going to be live action, but there will be CGI in it for sure.
1144000	1151000	Well, you know, I think, you know, like what they did in 1993 or four,
1151000	1156000	whatever it was with Jurassic Park is much easier to do for a lot of people now.
1156000	1160000	I mean, the best example I could say is like, look at those Sharknado movies.
1160000	1165000	OK, those Sharknado movies are extremely low budget, right?
1165000	1167000	Yet they do CGI effects.
1167000	1171000	Well, OK, let's not say it's going to be that bad CGI.
1171000	1172000	They could do it.
1172000	1179000	There's I think now it's easier to do a lot of that stuff and you can make the effects look better,
1179000	1181000	but you can't also rely heavily on it.
1181000	1184000	You have to have good writing as well.
1184000	1189000	So I think that we're probably in for a pretty decent show and it's a pretty exciting.
1189000	1195000	We've got this The Witcher. There's that Rainbow or was it a Ghost Recon
1195000	1198000	or Rainbow Six show that was supposed to be coming out or something like that.
1198000	1200000	Oh, yeah. Tom Clancy.
1200000	1202000	Yeah. I mean, it's pretty exciting.
1202000	1204000	They were getting all these like video game properties.
1204000	1209000	Not Sonic, but all the other stuff is very exciting.
1209000	1212000	I mean, we just had like Detective Pikachu and that was an amazing show.
1212000	1216000	I will still watch Sonic, but my bar is really low.
1216000	1220000	Have you ever seen that meme that's like the nine squares?
1220000	1221000	Yes.
1221000	1223000	And it goes like, thank you for.
1223000	1224000	So I feel like you're setting up.
1224000	1226000	That's exactly what I was thinking.
1226000	1228000	Where it's like Final Fantasy 14.
1228000	1234000	Thank and then like maybe the new Tomb Raider movie you for bringing video games in that center square.
1234000	1237000	Not you with the Sonic.
1237000	1238000	You guys know that meme I'm talking about.
1238000	1239000	Yes, I know.
1239000	1241000	I know exactly what you mean.
1241000	1242000	And that's exactly what I was thinking.
1242000	1244000	Not you.
1244000	1247000	Yeah, pretty much.
1247000	1248000	It'll you know what?
1248000	1250000	I will enjoy it for what it is.
1250000	1252000	I'm sure it's going to be absolute garbage.
1252000	1254000	And I love I can't wait.
1254000	1255000	They pushed it back.
1255000	1256000	It's going to be tweaked.
1256000	1257000	Let's give it a let's give it.
1257000	1259000	I want it to be absolute garbage.
1259000	1264000	It needs to be absolute garbage because that's going to make it super entertaining.
1264000	1266000	All right. Anyway, a few more notes of Final Fantasy 14.
1266000	1267000	Then we'll move on.
1267000	1275000	I do think that, you know, I completely respect why people don't want to pay the monthly fee to play Final Fantasy 14.
1275000	1278000	Especially if they don't have as many hours in the day to be able to play the game.
1278000	1283000	So they feel like I'm wasting my money because it's maybe something I'm only going to be able to play on the weekend or something.
1283000	1285000	But I will say this.
1285000	1289000	The story in Final Fantasy 14 is really good.
1289000	1297000	I to be fair, I don't think it really gets really good until you kind of get up to like the end of Realm Reborn.
1297000	1306000	Because I do feel like the game kind of has to get through like the leveling process where you get to level 50 and like a lot of tutorial and set up and, you know, learning about this mechanic and that mechanic.
1306000	1309000	And so it does feel like you're doing a lot of fetch quests and stuff.
1309000	1316000	But once you start to get into the part after they had to fix what was broken and get into our new shit.
1316000	1323000	And they did that with the end of Realm Reborn and they especially did that with Heaven's Word and Stormblood.
1323000	1328000	And I'm assuming this new one. I haven't played enough, you know, if the story is phenomenal yet.
1328000	1332000	But, you know, Heaven's Word and Stormblood are excellent stories.
1332000	1336000	Like honestly, in my opinion, some may disagree and I've said this before.
1336000	1342000	Heaven's Word and Stormblood are some of the strongest Final Fantasy stories in the entire series.
1343000	1347000	And hardly any of you know it because that monthly fee holds you back.
1347000	1349000	Which again, I completely understand.
1349000	1353000	And I know it's unreasonable because I pay like small monthly fees for a whole bunch of shit.
1353000	1356000	And so it's like, what's one more thing?
1356000	1365000	I mean, it's just, I don't want to feel tied down to playing one game all the time when I don't have enough time to play all of the games that I have in my backlog.
1365000	1370000	So it's like, you know, I would feel obligated to play that one game so much.
1370000	1372000	Now, SSTO 100 Matt in chat says,
1372000	1386000	It's truly an amazing, I'm assuming an amazing accomplishment, that a game that needed to completely wipe and reset after a bad initial release was able to come back from it to become a fantastic game that is now being considered for a live action series.
1386000	1389000	Speaks to how much of an amazing comeback story this has been.
1389000	1394000	Oh, absolutely. And the comeback kid is like this new thing in video games, right?
1394000	1399000	You know, between this and Diablo 3 and Destiny to some extent.
1399000	1407000	And I think what EA would really wish would happen to Anthem, but, you know, they're going to need to back it up a little bit, but we'll see.
1407000	1409000	Here's the problem, EA. You're EA.
1409000	1412000	Oh, No Man's Sky. Thank you, Dr. Seeya. Excellent, excellent example.
1412000	1417000	And also, EA, you have to make the game good in order for it to, you know, be worthy of stuff.
1417000	1421000	Well, no. I mean, they'll have to eventually, but it doesn't have to be good now.
1421000	1425000	I know that sounds crazy, but look at Final Fantasy XIV 1.0. It wasn't good.
1425000	1430000	Like, there's just no other nice way for me to say it. Final Fantasy XIV 1.0 wasn't good, and now it's great.
1430000	1438000	So, I mean, they can hopefully fix some of those issues, but is EA willing to put in the time and effort? History has shown, no, they're not going to.
1438000	1440000	They will shut down BioWare before they do that.
1440000	1445000	If they're going to change their tune, great. Let's see them do it. You know what I mean?
1445000	1453000	So, anyway. Alright, so Final Fantasy XIV series, I am, like, super looking forward to it as a fan of Final Fantasy.
1453000	1460000	I'll be very curious to hear more about, like, who's writing, directing the specific episodes, and who's starring, you know?
1460000	1466000	Are they going to get, like, big talent in this? Or is it going to be, like, you know, unknowns and hoping that the final...
1466000	1471000	Which is fine, you know, unknowns. There's, you know, maybe they're unknowns, but then they get discovered.
1471000	1476000	But I'll be very curious if they lure, like, some big names to this. This will be very interesting, huh?
1476000	1478000	Keanu Reeves is Sid.
1478000	1482000	Keanu Reeves is Sid. Who knows? Anything's possible. So, alright, anyway.
1482000	1487000	Let's move on, and Nifty805 says they should put Michelle Yeoh in it.
1487000	1491000	She's cool. There's a lot of people they could put in it, and I would be, like, super happy.
1491000	1495000	So it's one of those things where, just, let's get some more details.
1495000	1501000	But I wouldn't expect we're going to see a frame from this thing until 2021.
1501000	1505000	Right? How long ago did we hear about The Witcher? It was a while ago.
1505000	1506000	I think it was last year, I think.
1506000	1508000	And it's still not out. And we've only seen, what, like...
1508000	1510000	I think it's supposed to be out this year, though.
1510000	1511000	Is it later this year?
1511000	1512000	I think so.
1512000	1515000	Okay, well then maybe we'll see something fall next year. It just depends.
1515000	1519000	But I would expect we don't see a frame until 2021. But we'll see.
1519000	1522000	Anyway, let's move on to, how was your gaming week?
1522000	1525000	And the types of video games that you've been playing this week.
1525000	1529000	And I'm laughing a little bit because I know we do a video game podcast.
1529000	1532000	But we try to play as many games as we can in our spare time.
1532000	1534000	I don't know if we have a lot this week.
1534000	1536000	Loki, what are you up to this week?
1536000	1541000	I'm sorry, I'm bad. I've had a stressful week. It's getting better.
1541000	1544000	So I'm hoping to play more games next week.
1544000	1548000	I did play a little bit of Pokemon Go this week while I was out doing things.
1548000	1551000	And that was pretty much it, unfortunately.
1551000	1554000	Most of the time has been spent watching Awesome Games Done Quicks.
1554000	1557000	Or Summer Games Done Quick, I should say.
1557000	1560000	To be fair, I bet a lot of people would say that.
1560000	1563000	I didn't game myself this week because I was watching SGDQ.
1563000	1565000	Because it's a big thing in the gaming community.
1565000	1567000	I mean, I picked up some games.
1567000	1570000	I bought Mario Maker 2 because my kids wanted to play it.
1570000	1572000	You said they played it and you watched it a little bit, right?
1572000	1573000	They said that they were bored with it.
1573000	1574000	Or they're not bored with it.
1574000	1576000	But they said it's not as good as the first one.
1576000	1580000	But I don't know. They don't know what the hell they're talking about.
1580000	1581000	They're kids!
1581000	1587000	I take that back. I did play a tiny little bit of Mario and the Rabbids Kingdom Battle.
1587000	1590000	Because my son wanted me to beat a level for him.
1590000	1592000	And so I had to do that a little bit.
1592000	1594000	I still haven't played through that game. I probably should.
1594000	1596000	And then...
1596000	1601000	What else? Oh, I picked up Moshpit Simulator on PC for VR.
1601000	1603000	Because my son wanted that as well.
1603000	1605000	And also that looks like stupid.
1605000	1607000	And I kind of want to play it as well.
1607000	1611000	I've been looking through the Steam sales stuff to see if there's anything I want to pick up.
1611000	1614000	There hasn't been a whole lot of things that I...
1614000	1616000	I put a few things in my cart and I'm like,
1616000	1618000	I'm not going to play that. What am I buying?
1618000	1620000	Or what am I even trying to buy that for?
1620000	1622000	Just Cause 4. I'm not playing that.
1622000	1625000	I haven't played through Just Cause 3. What am I going to pick that up for?
1625000	1627000	So, you know, stuff like that.
1627000	1630000	So I've been just kind of holding myself back from purchasing things.
1630000	1634000	Worked on my game a little bit for a couple hours the other day.
1634000	1636000	So he did that.
1636000	1639000	Son finally graduated to Yellowbelt in his coding stuff.
1639000	1641000	So now he's going to be doing JavaScript.
1641000	1644000	So that's pretty cool. Outside of just, like, Scratch.
1644000	1646000	So he's got that for a couple more belts.
1646000	1648000	And yeah.
1648000	1650000	And I've been just doing my stuff.
1650000	1652000	I keep getting questions, though, from their...
1652000	1655000	They call them their senseis or whatever.
1655000	1658000	The kids that teach them, help them with stuff.
1658000	1661000	About, like, so you can put your game on Steam.
1661000	1663000	What's it called?
1663000	1665000	So I'm like, dude, it's still in the prototype phase.
1665000	1671000	We're not even talking about platforms and shit until I get something that resembles a game.
1671000	1675000	But it's getting more and more like a game every day.
1675000	1677000	Nice. Alright. Anything else?
1677000	1679000	That's it.
1679000	1682000	So my gaming week was pretty sad this week.
1682000	1685000	I meant to pick up Mario Maker, but I got so sidetracked.
1685000	1691000	So I had a big personal issue that came up this week that really took my attention.
1691000	1693000	And it was, like, extremely stressful.
1693000	1696000	And yeah, so I'm not going to get into details.
1696000	1698000	It's not worth going over on a video game podcast.
1698000	1704000	But just needless to say, my attention was completely diverted with that for a couple of nights this week.
1704000	1706000	And some of the time I would have been playing video games.
1706000	1713000	But when I wasn't, like, with that situation or with work or something,
1713000	1718000	another thing that's been taking up quite a bit of my time is, and I don't know, Loki, you might laugh or whatever,
1718000	1722000	but I signed up to play another one of those online reality games.
1722000	1725000	I'm playing another survivor-y type of game online.
1725000	1729000	So in fact, the guys running it were kind of like, you didn't say anything on your podcast last week.
1729000	1734000	So I'll say something this week. And I'm even doing it for free.
1734000	1738000	So I'm playing a game called Power ORG because ORG is what they call a lot of these things.
1738000	1740000	So ORG is online reality game.
1740000	1742000	So it's like a survivor-y type of clone.
1742000	1745000	I played one of these about a year ago, like another big one.
1745000	1748000	And so I've talked about this a little bit on the show before.
1748000	1750000	But basically, it's pretty elaborate.
1750000	1756000	Like, there's people that work on putting it together and having like a legit…
1756000	1759000	So obviously you're not stranded on a desert island.
1759000	1761000	You're trying to live your freaking life, right?
1761000	1767000	But when I come home from work, it's like there might be a challenge that we have to look at tonight.
1767000	1770000	Or there might be a tribal council coming up.
1770000	1777000	So you've got to try to chat with people or talk with people or whatever to try to make sure that it's not going to be you that gets voted out and that whole thing.
1777000	1780000	But you guys know that I've been listening to show for a long time.
1780000	1783000	I've always kind of had a soft spot for those type of games.
1783000	1786000	Well, here's the thing. I've loved game shows all the time since I was a kid, right?
1786000	1788000	I grew up on the match game, right? And that type of stuff.
1788000	1790000	And pressure lock and all that shit, right?
1790000	1795000	So when it kind of got fused with reality TV, when Survivor first started, what?
1795000	1797000	It's going to be like 20 years ago, right?
1797000	1798000	Yeah.
1799000	1801000	I kind of was really into that now.
1801000	1804000	It's interesting because I don't watch the TV shows as much now.
1804000	1809000	But it doesn't mean I don't think the game is kind of fun. It's kind of neat.
1809000	1813000	But I always forget what a time sink it can be until I kind of get into it.
1813000	1819000	And part of the reason I agreed to do it is because I'd been asked to do some other games.
1819000	1823000	I had to keep saying no because I knew I'd be gone for a week.
1823000	1826000	I'm going to Chicago for a week and it's in the middle of the game. I can't do it.
1826000	1829000	I'm going to a convention. I'm going to Dragon Con. I'm going to whatever.
1829000	1835000	And if you agree to do this, you want to realistically know that you're going to have six weeks
1835000	1838000	where you can kind of actually be there to play the game.
1838000	1843000	But a nice little time period here kind of worked out where it's the end of June.
1843000	1845000	And this is, I think, supposed to go through mid-August.
1845000	1849000	So it's right up against then Dragon Con so it won't get in the way.
1849000	1851000	So I was like, okay, the timing works out.
1851000	1854000	I know some of the people that are putting it together.
1854000	1857000	I'd met through the community so I'm like, what the hell? I'll do it.
1857000	1861000	And then I'm like, oh, shit, now I haven't played any video games this week because of it.
1861000	1869000	Kudos to the ORG community in general that's very passionate and stuff about it.
1869000	1871000	It's pretty impressive.
1871000	1874000	They actually did a little, oh, I should have pulled it and showed it on the show.
1874000	1876000	You guys would have cracked up.
1876000	1880000	They actually did a little fakey-fake introduction that looks like the show.
1880000	1884000	So we had to go out and shoot ourselves doing something in nature.
1884000	1890000	And then a little turn and face the camera type of shot where it's like, face the camera, that type of thing.
1890000	1892000	Like they kind of do on the show.
1892000	1894000	Although mine's a little more serious than that.
1894000	1899000	But then a guy actually put it all together and put a little theme music and it's super cute.
1899000	1903000	So it's amazing what fans can do, don't you think?
1903000	1904000	Yeah.
1904000	1905000	That's right.
1906000	1913000	And now it's going to take something like that being put on Twitch on a regular basis.
1913000	1916000	Oh, I'm sure it's been on Twitch somewhere.
1916000	1922000	People stream themselves playing like Werewolf and Mafia and that kind of stuff.
1922000	1927000	These things are just like the next step past that.
1927000	1931000	So like an underground survivor type show.
1932000	1939000	Several people I've met doing these things have done a thing called Sequester, which is like a YouTube show.
1939000	1942000	And I think that's another big thing.
1942000	1949000	Like fan shows, I know there's a big one, Survivor Maryland, Survivor Boston.
1949000	1955000	And so they do like a lot of college campuses have like a Survivor Club or something like that.
1955000	1959000	And they do like a fakey-fake version of the show and they put it on YouTube.
1959000	1965000	And I guess for whatever reason, the production company behind Survivor is cool with it because I've never seen them try to shut that type of stuff down.
1965000	1967000	But I mean, it's kind of free advertising for the brand.
1967000	1969000	That show's been on for 20 years.
1969000	1975000	I don't think they were like, well, people want to watch the Survivor Philadelphia version more than like whatever.
1975000	1978000	OK, so I'm getting questions in chat about this.
1978000	1984000	So S2100 Matt says, is Rob the character that isn't there to make friends and will do what he wants?
1984000	1988000	Well, now I can't give away my strategy on air because I don't know who's watching.
1988000	1994000	But no, I I wouldn't play the games if I didn't genuinely enjoy meeting the people.
1994000	2000000	And I like the last game I played, I met somebody that lived here in the same town that I do.
2000000	2004000	And we actually like we hang out once a month, like we're legit like friends.
2004000	2008000	So he lasted a lot longer in the game than I did. But like we're legit friends. We hang out.
2008000	2014000	I actually want to do an episode of OLR one night where we bring some of those guys, because there's a few of them that live here, bring some of them over.
2014000	2018000	And we have like an ORG night on the show, kind of like we did the Ingers night a few months ago.
2018000	2021000	That's ORG, not ORG.
2021000	2029000	ORG. I'm not violating the online reality game. ORG. I'm not violating the Twitch terms of service by having an ORG.
2029000	2035000	OK, it's different. All right. Anyway, what was the other question I saw in chat here?
2035000	2042000	Oh, Nifty 105 says, Rob Roberts is not the silky. He's probably more like the Ben De La Creme.
2042000	2047000	Those are Drag Race references. Let's see. I don't know what what. Oh, you know.
2047000	2052000	Now, here's the here's the here's the real tea. You ready? I'm the Charlie Hides.
2052000	2061000	Because I'm like the only one that's like 40, like a lot of them to play are like mid 20s, late 20s, maybe a few early 30s.
2061000	2067000	Like one of the people I met here in town is like maybe 33, I think. So, yeah, no, I'm definitely like that.
2067000	2071000	And yeah, I'm very much the how do you do fellow kids like that's yeah.
2071000	2077000	But that's because I started this whole thing years ago on LiveJournal when I was 28.
2077000	2079000	They were doing these things back on LiveJournal then, too.
2079000	2084000	And then it was one of my friends from back in those days that was like, did you know these are still going on?
2084000	2088000	But they all play on Skype now and not AOL. It's a messenger. I'm like, what? Tell me more.
2088000	2092000	And then, yeah, I played one. I was like, OK, this is fun. It's really stressful, but it's fun.
2092000	2100000	So, cool. There you go. All right. I spent way too much time on that topic, except for maybe the couple of people from that community that will be listening to this who will probably get a kick out of that.
2100000	2110000	So there you go. You can you can look it up on Facebook. There's your free promo for Power Orgy, not Power Orgy, or you're going to get something completely different.
2110000	2115000	Just a warning. All right. So that's it for our gaming leaks.
2115000	2118000	Yeah, it's still it's still a game. What I'm doing, it's just not a video game.
2118000	2124000	Yeah, it's a different type of game. So it's it's fucking LARPing is what it is.
2124000	2130000	It's it's fucking LARPing. It is. It's more respectable LARPing, I guess.
2130000	2135000	Oh, why? Thank you. It's LARPing without the effort.
2135000	2142000	It's LARPing, except you are kind of being yourself unless you want to be a character, I guess. I don't know. Anyway.
2142000	2147000	S.J. 100 Matt says it's LARPing without yelling out spells. I had some of the challenges.
2147000	2150000	I don't know. I don't know. All right. Let's move on. New topic. All right.
2150000	2155000	Let's get into some gaming news and some things that have been going on around the video game world this week.
2155000	2160000	Loki, start us off. They got LARPing and ingress, isn't a thing? I don't know.
2160000	2166000	I don't know. So anyways, there's yeah, there's a steam sale going on in case you weren't aware.
2166000	2171000	And Valve has been doing this thing where they have it's kind of like a racing theme.
2171000	2180000	So they've got five teams that you can pick to join and basing based on certain challenges,
2180000	2188000	you purchasing games and I think doing other things, it helps boost your team ahead and and everybody's team corgi.
2188000	2193000	So it doesn't matter anyways. You just pick team corgi and then you might win something.
2193000	2200000	Basically, I think every day or every so often they will see who's going to win.
2200000	2205000	And based on that, some people might win their top wish list game.
2205000	2216000	But there was some confusion what you had to do to actually be able to win some stuff.
2216000	2227000	So what people have done is they've thought that they had to remove games from their wish list in order to boost the chance that they're going to win the one that they want.
2227000	2235000	And that's unfortunately caused some issues where that they have removed like some people that had indie games out there.
2235000	2242000	They're like, we saw a huge drop in all the people that had our game on their wish list because we were a five dollar indie game.
2242000	2248000	Yeah. So, you know, unfortunately, that was kind of one of the things.
2248000	2253000	Also, there has been I guess in this one, though, you can't actually get like trading cards.
2253000	2261000	It's just earning different things from this whole event. I stopped caring about that stuff a long time ago.
2261000	2266000	I just been looking at some of the stuff that's on sale, which is a few things I want.
2266000	2269000	Definitely not as like deep cuts in.
2269000	2281000	And also now that the sales are kind of the same, I think every single day, as far as I'm aware, it's less of that coming back to like, oh, what's on sale today or what's on sale right now?
2281000	2284000	You know, these flash sales and stuff like that. Oh, a better wait.
2284000	2287000	And, you know, that was more interesting and more traffic to the site, I think.
2287000	2290000	But now it's just kind of. I don't know.
2290000	2294000	So like they were saying, here's some of the quotes we had from different developers.
2294000	2301000	So they were saying that Yitz, who is, I guess, a developer of a game called Neffing and the Dark or to the Dark Tower,
2301000	2310000	basically saying that most indies who we're talking to at least are losing more money from the Steam's or Steam's cut than from taking in from visibility.
2310000	2315000	I and many other devs are currently losing money from being hosted on Steam.
2315000	2325000	And of course, Valve is apologizing, saying we designed something pretty complicated, a whole bunch of numbers and rules and recognize we should have been more clear.
2325000	2332000	We want to apologize for the confusion that this has caused and apologize for the broken mechanics that have led to unbalanced event.
2332000	2339000	So the TLDR of that is be Team Corgi because you're going to win every time.
2340000	2344000	Yeah, I as somebody told me about that and said, just go pick Corgi.
2344000	2349000	So I logged in and did that. But then it was like, oh, you got to play these games to get the achievement and all this stuff.
2349000	2354000	And I'm like, I'd love to do this. But, you know, the other thing I signed up for going on.
2354000	2359000	And even when I'm not doing that, I didn't even talk about during my gaming week. So I guess I'll just sneak it in here.
2359000	2363000	I did touch that Final Fantasy 14 expansion, at least for a few hours.
2363000	2368000	And so I haven't gotten enough into the story, but I will say it's fucking gorgeous.
2368000	2376000	Like the whole concept of it to start is that you go into this. I don't want to call it the upside down because that's like you.
2376000	2377000	Dynamics.
2377000	2381000	It would make you think, well, it's like you go to like an alternate reality of the world.
2381000	2387000	They call it the first. But you go to like an alternate reality world where like you end up there in the first guy you meet.
2387000	2390000	It's like super bright out. And he goes, what are you doing here this time of night?
2390000	2394000	Even though it's like super bright out. And so you kind of get the sense that like things are off.
2394000	2401000	And in this world, light has ruined things. So that's kind of like the whole setup.
2401000	2407000	So the world looks very different and it's gorgeous. So, yeah, I played that for a few hours.
2407000	2414000	I ran a dungeon that was nothing but dancers and gun breakers and me, the astrologian, because I was trying to get a feel for my job.
2414000	2418000	And they made healing a lot harder. Boy, because they've shuffled all the skills and all this stuff.
2418000	2422000	So it was fun. But it's just like, oh, I got to reorient and like remember things.
2422000	2427000	I'm sure there's going to be some balancing patches. I'm sure of it. But I enjoyed what I played a FOM SE 14 so far.
2427000	2428000	Cool.
2428000	2434000	So, yeah, there's that anyway. So that's part of the reason why I didn't do the achievements in the steam sale and all that other stuff.
2434000	2440000	But I will point out the number one thing on my steam wish list is like a one hundred dollar game development program.
2440000	2447000	Would I actually win that if I won something on steam or are they going to say like a maximum is 60 bucks and something else?
2447000	2451000	I'm not going to win anything because there's so many millions of people on steam.
2451000	2457000	It just doesn't. Who cares? Oh, no, I won't get a free game that will go into my library.
2457000	2461000	That will never play. Oh, geez. Oh, darn.
2461000	2465000	Why we are in our chat says, yeah, I won't have much time to play during the steam sale either.
2465000	2475000	I don't even have enough time to put together a 10 anniversary video last week because why we are developed games and has a few over the past 10 years from video clips and voiceovers that I already had recorded.
2475000	2482000	Well, yeah. You know, life happens, right? Day jobs get in the way. That's what happens. Yeah. So anyhow.
2482000	2490000	Yeah. So if you haven't already gone in on the steam sale, you might want to just check your wish list because maybe there's something on there you want to get when it's on sale.
2490000	2494000	And, you know, go go check out the race thing, even though it's a really weird mechanic.
2494000	2498000	Like if you wanted me to explain how that race works, I really can't. Yeah.
2498000	2505000	Can anyone in chat like summarize how does the race thing even work? Is it just like the more achievements your team unlocks, the further you go in the race?
2505000	2511000	I think it's also like you buy stuff and you get points, which is weird because I bought stuff, but I couldn't apply points to anything.
2511000	2518000	So I guess my purchase didn't count. Not that I care, but I know.
2518000	2525000	Yeah, I did notice like all the things that were like spending points on like a lot of it was like themes and mode icons and that type of stuff that you'd usually get from the trading cards.
2525000	2532000	So, yeah. And I was like, OK, it's not the end of the world. I didn't even know what like I was just looking at some different things that are in there.
2532000	2538000	And I don't know. I'll probably I'm looking for like some cheap VR games, you know, so that that was kind of one thing.
2538000	2543000	And then there's just some stuff that I've had on my wish list for a while that I was looking at.
2543000	2547000	I thought about just cause for but like I seriously I have just caused three on PlayStation four.
2547000	2551000	I've not played that game. And four I hear is not that great anyways.
2551000	2557000	Oh, how much is six down to. That's a that's a great game there.
2557000	2562000	Oh, twenty nine ninety nine. That's twenty five percent. That's the DLC only gathering storm.
2562000	2569000	Oh, yeah. Yeah. You pick that up actually. So maybe I'll do it. I know it's guys half off blood scenes. Ten percent.
2569000	2572000	I know why we are is explaining a little better what the sales all about.
2572000	2579000	Chat say you can buy stuff to increase the max number of points you can earn to actually earn the points.
2579000	2583000	You complete the quest and or unlock achievements in the steam games.
2583000	2587000	So I mean, what it is, you actually have to play games, Loki. No.
2587000	2593000	And then the team with the most points wins, a.k.a. corgi wins because everybody loves corgis.
2593000	2597000	I'm not even a dog person and I think corgis are so fucking cute.
2597000	2601000	Yeah. So I mean, it's the way it is. Let's see.
2601000	2608000	S.S.U. 100 Matt with an interesting perspective as well in our chat at Twitch TV slash Vogue Network says Prime Day is in a few weeks.
2608000	2612000	So I might just wait for that. That's true. There are other sales.
2612000	2622000	I am waiting for Prime Day because I have a thing I got from my job, which is it's like a gift card servicing.
2622000	2627000	So you can redeem it for any type of gift card or most different gift cards.
2627000	2633000	I usually put it towards Amazon. So it's like 100 bucks towards Amazon on Prime Day, which I don't know the hell I'd buy, though.
2633000	2638000	I bought a 4K TV last year. I bought a VR headset just recently.
2638000	2641000	I saw what the hell am I going to need? I still don't have a 4K TV.
2641000	2649000	Like I'm tempted, but at the same time, like we need to spend money on more important things and responsibility.
2649000	2655000	Like a few hundred bucks. I guess that's true. I'm tempted, but the longer you wait, the cheaper they get.
2655000	2659000	That's true. So maybe I'll maybe I'll wait for like the holiday sales. Maybe it'll make a little more sense.
2659000	2663000	Because if you don't need it right away, there's I have 4K on my computer.
2663000	2669000	So, you know, again, I do more kind of there. How about you buy a new graphics card for your computer then?
2669000	2673000	That's honestly I wouldn't mind if I can find a good deal on something.
2673000	2680000	Well, they have the new super the GTX super cards that are coming or RTX super cards,
2680000	2687000	which are they're like they're a new set of graphics cards, but they're also going to be dropping the price of their older ones as well.
2687000	2691000	So you might look into that. It's going to happen in a couple weeks.
2693000	2697000	Yeah. Is Bitcoin mining still a problem with availability of those?
2697000	2703000	I think it's kind of dipped down because the price of Bitcoin has gone down, although it is going back up.
2703000	2708000	So it's not as bad as it used to be. Gotcha. All right.
2708000	2713000	As Stu 100 Matt says, Shane will use his hero's power to talk Rob into something.
2713000	2719000	He's already tried along the lines of, are you really playing another online game?
2719000	2724000	Just quit that game and come play Final Fantasy 14. And I'm like, no, I have too much.
2724000	2728000	If I say I'm going to do something, I'm going to do it. So, you know, but we'll see.
2728000	2734000	Anyway, we'll see how long it lasts for me anyway.
2734000	2741000	Moving on. Let's talk about the Final Fantasy 7 remake.
2741000	2745000	Final Fantasy 7, of course, is getting remade. We all know that.
2745000	2750000	And the remake is coming out March 20th, 2020.
2751000	2756000	I forgot the exact day, but it's in March. Do you remember the day?
2756000	2759000	I don't remember. I forgot the day. Somebody in chat would yell it out.
2759000	2763000	But anyway, it's starting to sound more and more like this first part of the Final Fantasy 7 remake.
2763000	2769000	I mean, it's like this is almost becoming its own Final Fantasy game, which I think we kind of saw coming a little bit.
2769000	2773000	The specifics this week that's coming out is about Materia.
2773000	2778000	So Materia is getting an overhaul, which kind of makes sense when you consider the battle system is different in the game.
2779000	2784000	Materia can't really work the exact same way because it's a little more action-based.
2784000	2789000	And so maybe the Materia being used on the spells and stuff is not really going to be the same thing.
2789000	2791000	So Materia is going to get a little bit of an overhaul.
2791000	2793000	We're going to use the draw system for me instead.
2793000	2798000	No, no. You still are going to slot Materia in weapons and all that stuff.
2798000	2802000	But Materia shows up on your party members when you equip it.
2802000	2808000	But yeah, it's going to change a little bit, so don't be used to the exact same way it worked before.
2808000	2812000	But you're going to have to use the special in-game currency to purchase your Materia.
2812000	2816000	Don't put that shit in the universe. Do not put that shit in the universe.
2816000	2819000	It'll be coming in a loot box that you can get your Materia in.
2819000	2824000	Well, what I'm also kind of curious about is that if this is only like Episode 1 or whatever,
2824000	2830000	and it only goes through the Midgar part, are we still going to get, even though it's like a 60-hour game still,
2830000	2839000	are we going to get the stages of fire, fura, fire aga, like the full evolution of magic
2839000	2841000	that you would see in a normal Final Fantasy game?
2841000	2845000	Or because it's only the first part of the game, we're only ever going to have fire?
2845000	2849000	Maybe fura, but that's it. It's never going to go for the full stages.
2849000	2852000	Are we going to be still kind of limited? Like you're not going to see Ultima in the game?
2852000	2856000	Or Summons? I don't think Summons came up until after Midgar. I can't remember. It's been a while.
2857000	2860000	And Aerith is still going to be alive.
2860000	2865000	In this game, yes. Because in Final Fantasy VII, the original, she does not pass until later on.
2865000	2867000	She passes to the end of this one.
2867000	2871000	There's going to be people that are actually surprised by that course of events.
2871000	2877000	Well, and as you said on a previous episode of the show, maybe Square will change it. That would be the real gag.
2877000	2880000	Cloud dies! Oh my god!
2880000	2884000	They're clearly taking liberties with the story.
2884000	2889000	And this is more and more feeling like, I don't want to say Final Fantasy XVI,
2889000	2895000	but this is definitely like every resource that would have been Final Fantasy XVI.
2895000	2899000	This is Final Fantasy XVI in how it plays and how it looks.
2899000	2905000	And now some of the mechanics almost sounds like it's just that the story is a retread.
2905000	2909000	A little bit. It's so interesting. It's Star Wars Episode VII.
2909000	2913000	They've resurrected the cow. We're getting ghost milk out of the cow now.
2913000	2918000	And they're just going to keep milking that cow until forever.
2920000	2925000	Questbuster says, wait, Aerith will live in this iteration? Guess I won't have to worry about finding a new healer then.
2925000	2929000	Well, it's only through Midgar, so if you remember the story,
2929000	2935000	Aerith doesn't die until later on in the story, after they're out in the world map.
2935000	2938000	It's a little bit later on. She dies at the end of disc one.
2938000	2943000	Maybe. So in this, she's not going to, unless, again, who knows if they're going to change.
2943000	2947000	Maybe they'll go the Tomb Raider route and she can die in lots of horrible ways.
2949000	2953000	Oh, Dark Sakura would love that. Aerith's no good, terrible, very bad day.
2953000	2955000	Yes. Yes.
2957000	2959000	So, let's see.
2959000	2965000	Questbuster also points out Materia will have, in quotes, surprise mechanics.
2965000	2969000	Not the EA type of surprise mechanics, I think we're hoping.
2969000	2976000	So anyway, I'm still, I mean, the folks I know that did go to E3 said, like, it's fun.
2976000	2982000	Like Final Fantasy 7 is fun. So it's going to be interesting, especially for the people that don't care for Final Fantasy 7,
2982000	2986000	because maybe people have hyped it up in history too much.
2986000	2992000	It's going to be interesting to see maybe what that group feels about this remake, because I imagine, you know,
2992000	2997000	most people are going to try this, whether they love the story or they hate the story, just because it's so different.
2997000	3001000	You know, and maybe, and because they've apparently taken some liberties with the story,
3001000	3003000	and maybe they're going to, you know, take some different branching paths.
3003000	3006000	And it's been so long anyways, I really don't remember much of the story.
3006000	3009000	I know, I don't either. I'm sure you can go read about it on Wikipedia, read the cliff notes and all that,
3009000	3012000	or go watch Advent Children to remember a good chunk of it.
3012000	3016000	But you're right. It's been so long that I'll probably go play this remake and go like,
3016000	3020000	okay, I remember a lot of that, even though, like, it's all new.
3021000	3027000	So, Kaijuto in chat says, I don't get the Aerith hate. I love that character.
3027000	3034000	You know, honestly, Kaijuto, like when I first played for, wow, my computer is playing an ad over here.
3034000	3038000	That's crazy. Anyway, thankfully this doesn't, this audio doesn't go on the feed anymore.
3038000	3040000	So it's just, it just scares me.
3040000	3048000	But yeah, when I first played Final Fantasy 7, I liked Aerith and I, because she was like my White Mage, my healer, right?
3048000	3053000	So I used her in the party. And so like when she got offed, I was like, it really was a huge shock.
3053000	3056000	Wow. She got her level four limit break. That's so convenient.
3056000	3058000	Why hasn't anybody else gotten their level four? Oh.
3058000	3064000	Yeah. And I was like, oh, I never got her level four limit break, but I was like, well, this is fucking irritating.
3064000	3071000	I've been leveling her for what? Because I kept thinking she'd come back and I'm like, oh, I guess, no, she, she dead.
3071000	3076000	So that was like frustrating for me. So I don't know if it's Aerith so much that I hate.
3076000	3084000	I, I still resent to this day the time I invested in her for nothing. I think that's what it is.
3084000	3092000	YYR in chat says, I'm one of those people. I liked Final Fantasy 7's characters, but I found the story to be meh and the gameplay to be disappointing.
3092000	3096000	So I'd love to see some improvements though. I won't have time to play it anyway. We'll see.
3096000	3099000	Anyway, let's move on some more stories. Loki.
3099000	3106000	All right. So let's talk a little bit more about TV again and another show that's going to be coming out.
3106000	3112000	So this is more along the lines of that one that they were talking about during the Ubisoft press conference where it's about game developers,
3112000	3116000	except these are actually about real game developers and not just like some imaginary company.
3116000	3128000	So this is an adaptation of a book called Masters of Doom that talks a little bit about how John Romero and John Carmack came together to create, of course, Doom.
3128000	3135000	And so it's a series, I guess, that's being produced by James and Dave Franco.
3135000	3153000	And yeah, it looks like it's just going to be an adaptation about how they formed id Software and how they kind of made that genre popularize the first person shooter genre.
3154000	3161000	I'm pretty excited about it. Apparently, it's expected to air on USA in twenty nineteen.
3161000	3168000	So. Yeah, I'm down. That sounds like it's really interesting.
3168000	3176000	Yeah, a little more of the it's like Silicon Valley, Silicon Valley, as I say, it sounds a little more like it's like the behind the scenes.
3176000	3180000	So it's not really about the game. It's like they're making Doom a new TV show, which, you know, the movie was not great.
3180000	3194000	So good thing. But kind of like that development, which is it's it's neat because now we're really seeing like video games and the impact on culture, despite however you feel about the character, the particular people that are going to be portrayed or or this particular game.
3194000	3204000	It's really neat that like video game development is like a cultural thing that is worth representing in television and other art forms, if that makes sense.
3204000	3213000	Yeah, right. It looks cool. Yeah. So, yeah, I'll check it out. I'll watch the first episode, see what I think. Right. Yeah, I've watched that.
3213000	3223000	And I'm also very excited about that other show that unfortunately is going to be an Apple exclusive show that the one that's with the guys from It's Always Sunny doing that.
3223000	3229000	Oh, yeah. What is what what game? What is that one about? It's it's it's like a fake MMO type thing.
3229000	3238000	I don't remember what the show is actually called, but it's. I do want to check it out because of the folks in it, but.
3238000	3245000	Yeah. Oh, yeah. Well, because. Well, and the always sunny in Philadelphia thing like that has to be ending soon. That's been on for what, like 12 years.
3245000	3251000	I'm sure they want to go their own separate ways soon. You know, it's been on for a long time, although.
3251000	3260000	Yeah, some of them have gone off to do other shows, but I know like one of them, like APA Bio, is being canceled. So it's like, OK, what are you going to be doing now?
3260000	3268000	Siya Tiberian Chat says, don't forget USA knows drama, characters welcome. Yeah, it is interesting. I mean, USA is, you know, kind of pumped up its drama stuff.
3268000	3276000	So it's an interesting place for it to land. I think there's a lot of us that are kind of like, OK, so it'll air on USA. But but which digital service is going to get it?
3277000	3284000	Yeah, I know. Right. I think it's where a lot of us are. You think we're going to end up kind of back where we were like 10 years ago, where everything gets pirated?
3284000	3292000	Like you say, like, it's unfortunate this thing is going to Apple or it's unfortunate this thing is going to this service where it's like, I'm not going to pay for 17 different services.
3292000	3300000	So it's like you think piracy, we're going to kind of end up right back there because these services will not work a little more collaboratively.
3300000	3306000	Yes. Yeah, I think that's exactly where we end up, which is fine with me.
3306000	3314000	Questbuster in chat says, I hope the series does the story justice. That's true. They might embellish some things. They might, you know, make up lies.
3314000	3318000	But that's that's what happens when stories get adapted for TV, I guess.
3318000	3322000	Metal Mayhem says, I've heard of that book thanks to Game Informer, but I never got it.
3322000	3328000	I did get the audiobook version of The Ultimate Guide to Video Games from Pong to Pokemon a while back through Humble Bundle.
3328000	3332000	So I guess audiobook is always a good way to listen to books, too, if you want to do that.
3332000	3336000	Yeah, I got that. I bought that one series. I don't remember which books were in that.
3336000	3342000	But for the record, this is like the one podcast that isn't sponsored by any sort of audiobook service. So I'm not pitching that.
3342000	3351000	No, there was one I got that was it wasn't that it was remember I showed you there was one about ZZT in there about the making of like ZZT.
3351000	3357000	But I don't remember what that one was. And they were a small like I wouldn't even necessarily call it a book.
3357000	3363000	I mean, it was a book, but it was really short. And I don't remember which Humble Bundle it was.
3363000	3365000	But I bought that one with the ZZT thing because.
3365000	3367000	Boss Fight Books says PixelBox.
3367000	3369000	There you go. Thank you. Yes.
3369000	3372000	Chatter is always there to save the day when we can't remember things.
3372000	3380000	When I'm too lazy to search it in Google or go into Humble Bundle and actually see what what it's called speaking, which I have to see what they have on there right now.
3380000	3388000	I'm compelled to buy things that I don't need. That's where I should spend my hundred dollars on this crap.
3388000	3390000	Ooh, programming.
3390000	3391000	Hi.
3391000	3396000	Anyways, moving on. Let's talk about Bloodstained and the Switch version.
3396000	3403000	So the Switch version of Bloodstained finally came out this week because it was delayed a week from the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions.
3403000	3406000	That's the version that I ended up getting through my Kickstarter.
3406000	3410000	But due to the things I talked about earlier, I just haven't gotten around to playing it yet.
3410000	3418000	But apparently the port is not quite performing on the same level as the other versions, which, you know, due to technical.
3418000	3421000	You know, what's inside a switch is not what's inside a PlayStation 4.
3421000	3423000	So you write a little bit of it at the same time.
3423000	3430000	If you're going to put the game on the switch, it needs to be able to perform at a respectable, comparable level just as far as the game goes.
3430000	3432000	And apparently it's having some problems.
3432000	3437000	I have not played it myself, so I don't feel comfortable saying it's doing X or Y or Z for me.
3437000	3441000	How would they even put that on the Wii U when that was originally the plan, was to put it on the Wii U?
3441000	3446000	I mean, I can't imagine that that would have been successful at all if they're having trouble on the Switch.
3446000	3451000	Yeah, I don't know. I think they changed. I'm sorry, I'm having a coughing fit, guys.
3451000	3457000	But anyways. Yeah, that's unfortunate. I do want to play it, though.
3457000	3460000	Yeah. Sorry, guys. Coughing fit's terrible when you're trying to do a show.
3460000	3465000	Anyway, I'm curious what you guys in chat, if any of you have played it on the Switch.
3465000	3470000	And do you guys think a lot of this talk is, like, you know, because sometimes, you know how it goes.
3470000	3475000	Like, gamers will take a few small minor things and make a big fucking deal out of it, you know.
3475000	3479000	I think we saw that happen with Mass Effect Andromeda in some cases, you know, and so on.
3479000	3484000	So I'm curious if you guys think it really is a problem for those of you that have played Bloodstained on Switch.
3484000	3490000	But apparently low resolution and handheld is getting called out. Some visual pieces are not there.
3490000	3494000	I would expect that the graphic fidelity is probably a little bit downgraded.
3494000	3498000	Like, if there's some missing things that aren't in the other ones, I might expect a little bit of that.
3498000	3504000	I mean, but then again, I feel like Bloodstained is not, like, it's still like a 2.5D.
3504000	3508000	Like, you know, it's 3D, but in a 2D game. So I feel like it's not.
3508000	3509000	It should be very minimal.
3509000	3510000	Yeah, right.
3510000	3518000	So anyway, well, it is important to point out the developers behind Bloodstained have addressed all these issues on their Kickstarter page and saying they are going to update it.
3518000	3522000	Saying, quote, we have been listening to feedback regarding the Switch's performance.
3522000	3527000	Our goal is for everyone, regardless of platform, to be able to enjoy the game and have it run smoothly.
3527000	3530000	We will want to live up to your and our expectations.
3530000	3534000	Throughout the QA process, we have been addressing performance issues in the game.
3534000	3539000	Update 101 was published to Switch prior to launch to add content and improve performance.
3539000	3544000	Because they seem to remember, didn't the Switch version have problems at a convention that they were showing you at?
3544000	3546000	And they were kind of like, it's further along.
3546000	3548000	I seem to remember that was the thing at, like, PAX or something.
3548000	3550000	I sort of remember that.
3550000	3553000	Anyway, they said it did not accomplish as much as we'd hoped, and we need to do more.
3553000	3560000	To address the concerns brought up by the community, we are immediately shifting resources to improve performance and stability for the Switch.
3560000	3563000	So don't expect any type of DLC or anything else right away, because they've got to fix this.
3564000	3569000	You can expect a number of small updates that will improve different areas of the game, rather than waiting longer for one big update.
3569000	3571000	We will have more details as we dive into the work.
3571000	3574000	We thank you for your patience, et cetera, et cetera.
3574000	3578000	So now I'm starting to wonder if, should I bother starting?
3578000	3581000	Or should I wait a month for them to get some patches out?
3581000	3583000	I don't know.
3583000	3586000	YYR in chat says, are there any versions that don't have issues?
3586000	3589000	Questbuster says, the Bloodstained Switch issues make me sad.
3589000	3593000	I have the PlayStation 4 version, which has its own issues, but the Switch issues sound worse.
3593000	3596000	Darktoseo says, it should be damned. I still want it.
3596000	3598000	Let's see.
3598000	3603000	Darktoseo reminds us, they say they are working on it for patches and other fixes.
3603000	3611000	Questbuster says, the only thing I don't like about the PS4 version are some of the loads, especially around saves and reloads.
3611000	3613000	Otherwise, amazing game.
3613000	3617000	And YYR says, wait, they already patched it? That means it must have been even worse before.
3617000	3625000	That's why I'm kind of remembering, I really feel like if you go back to some of the things we talked about around like PAX East this year, I want to say it was the thing.
3625000	3633000	I want to say that they showed a Bloodstained demo on the floor on the Switch, and that this kind of feedback was coming in, and they kind of said we're already working on a patch.
3633000	3638000	So I feel like this 1.01 was kind of the post PAX update, perhaps?
3638000	3643000	I don't know. I mean, obviously I'm not on the inside. I don't know what exactly it is.
3643000	3647000	But I feel like that might be why the Switch version was already starting to see some patches.
3647000	3655000	But I still want to play the game. I'm hoping people are just kind of blowing it out of proportion.
3655000	3661000	I can deal with a little frame skip here and there, but if it is super jittery throughout the whole thing, it's going to be annoying.
3661000	3667000	We'll see. Here's hoping. Anyway, let's move on. Another story. Loki.
3667000	3676000	So where you have many franchises adding Battle Royale to their games, now you have a Battle Royale franchise that's adding a single player campaign.
3676000	3683000	But why single player? Nobody plays single player games anymore. Single player is dead, I've been told.
3683000	3688000	But apparently not, because that's what PUBG is going to be doing.
3688000	3694000	They're working on actually creating an original narrative experience set in the same universe.
3694000	3708000	Apparently the game is, the single player campaign they're saying is going to be written by Glenn Shulfield, who actually did the original Dead Space.
3708000	3713000	And I guess has worked on Call of Duty when he was at Sledgehammer Games as well.
3713000	3718000	So, interesting that that's going to be a thing. I don't know.
3718000	3729000	By the sounds of this, it almost sounds like it's going to be a separate game, kind of in the same universe, to the effect of Titanfall and Apex Legends, but kind of in the reverse.
3729000	3736000	So, interesting. I'd be curious to see what this is all about, but...
3738000	3739000	Single player's dead!
3740000	3751000	Yeah, isn't it interesting how that whole thing has come full circle? It was like everything had to have a Battle Royale mode, and now it's like, oh, but if your game, you know, like this is only Battle Royale, and maybe PUBG's kind of been eclipsed.
3751000	3757000	I want to say, I don't want to, because, you know, fans of PUBG are going to be like, there's still a ton of people playing PUBG. Of course there are.
3757000	3765000	But, you know, a lot of the conversation has been around Fortnite and, you know, other Battle Royale games. Heck, we're talking about another Battle Royale game later in the show that's very unexpected.
3765000	3769000	Although, I think they're cheating on that one, but I will get to it later.
3769000	3776000	But anyway, there's a lot of games using the Battle Royale moniker. Tetris 99, which, but that one's really cool, obviously.
3776000	3787000	You know, there's a lot of games that are using that Battle Royale thing, and now it's kind of like, okay, maybe PUBG's having a hard time kind of standing out, so it kind of like needs the single player thing to bring people back to it and experience this again.
3787000	3795000	Like, I think for some people, it's probably like the people that already had it and bought it for Battle Royale, but moved on to Fortnite, moved on to Apex Legends.
3795000	3800000	It's, oh, I have this new single player mode to check out. I should come on back and check out the game.
3800000	3806000	And maybe if I come on back and check out the game and stream it to Twitch, other people will check out the game for the first time.
3806000	3810000	And so I think they're hoping for kind of like a domino effect with that a little bit.
3811000	3819000	So, Metal Mayhem in chat says, single player is dead. Why wasn't I notified of this? I've pretty much been playing single player stuff exclusively. I guess I was wasting my time.
3819000	3827000	Well, I mean, that's what big AAA companies have told me. It's funny, because they'll sell you on that, oh, well, single player is dead.
3827000	3833000	Here's a brand new single player Star Wars game they were putting out as well. They don't fucking know what the hell they're talking about.
3833000	3841000	They'll say it one instance, but then at the same time, it's dead. But we're making games for that dead genre anyways, because it's dead.
3842000	3850000	YYR in chat says, there was actually an analyst who mused recently that the market could be wide open for AAA single player experiences right now.
3850000	3855000	That gamers are starting to burn out on games as a service and games that are never supposed to end.
3856000	3861000	Yeah, and I think that's why Final Fantasy VII Remake is coming at a really good time, I think, in some ways.
3861000	3866000	So, you know, I think, yeah, for sure, like, AAA single player experiences, I think, absolutely are desired.
3866000	3871000	Hey, YYR, have you ever thought about Snake 360 Royale?
3873000	3874000	Stop.
3874000	3877000	I had to ask. I had to ask. Don't hate me.
3879000	3880000	But think about it.
3880000	3881000	That's Slither.io at that point.
3881000	3884000	Think about it. Think about a giant, oh, has that already been done?
3884000	3885000	That's Slither.io.
3885000	3886000	God damn it.
3886000	3890000	Sort of. Slither.io is a little bit different, but it's basically the same thing.
3890000	3894000	YYR in chat responded with, sometimes less is more, right?
3894000	3896000	YYR simply responded with dot, dot, dot.
3898000	3899000	Don't indulge him.
3900000	3901000	Don't indulge me.
3902000	3907000	Alright, moving on to talk about other ways to maybe bring people back to something
3907000	3912000	and, you know, remind them of the value of the Switch Online Gaming Library.
3913000	3918000	You know, it's no secret. Folks would like to see some more on the NES Online Library.
3918000	3919000	No shit.
3919000	3923000	We still don't know July's games, do we? We got June's. We haven't gotten to July's yet, right?
3923000	3926000	Oh, I'm sure it'll be so amazing that I'll have to just come right...
3926000	3930000	No, it won't. It'll be fucking stupid NES games that no one gives a shit about.
3930000	3931000	Well...
3931000	3933000	Is there another, like, I don't know...
3933000	3936000	It should be noted that perhaps, you know...
3936000	3938000	It should be all the Tengen games.
3938000	3944000	I don't think they could do that, I think because of, you know, lawsuits and things like that.
3944000	3945000	I know, would that be funny?
3945000	3954000	Anyway, so in a Japanese interview, Nintendo has actually kind of commented on this whole state of the Switch Online
3954000	3959000	and, you know, could there be more platforms that come to the Switch Online Library in the future?
3959000	3960000	And they said to this, quote,
3960000	3965000	At this place, we cannot tell new information about future classic hardware, among others,
3965000	3968000	but we are thinking about providing an extension of the online service,
3968000	3972000	which is currently providing Famicom or NES software, because it's a Japanese interview,
3972000	3975000	as well as other methods of providing them.
3975000	3979000	We also recognize that there are opinions wanting to play past titles.
3979000	3983000	So at least Nintendo is kind of, like, acknowledging that they hear it.
3984000	3992000	And this theory has come up before on our show, Bobby's show and other shows out there that talk about video games,
3992000	3999000	is that most people are going to have to re-up their Nintendo Switch Online thing in a year, in, like, October.
3999000	4004000	So that would be a really good time for Nintendo to put out more bang for, you know,
4004000	4008000	here's the value you're getting in continuing to be a Nintendo Switch Online subscriber.
4008000	4012000	So I kind of think that is now the point where we're going to start to see,
4012000	4016000	oh, the 20 Super Nintendo games or whatever they decide to do are going to come out that month.
4016000	4021000	Maybe some other, because it seems like Tetris 99 has done very well for them.
4021000	4024000	So maybe they'll put out something else.
4024000	4027000	Mario Battle Royale, since they shut the other one down, right?
4027000	4031000	I just, I've already made this argument so many times.
4031000	4036000	I don't even, like, they would have made, I think they would have made so much more money
4036000	4039000	just doing straight up virtual console than this crap.
4039000	4046000	Honestly, I mean, I don't even know why they didn't do it, because they would make just so much money.
4046000	4051000	They could still have the online service and give you a couple free games or an access to a library of games,
4051000	4055000	but then separately just have virtual console where you can purchase, like,
4055000	4058000	Super Nintendo games and other stuff that people wanted to get,
4058000	4062000	and they would make so much more money than they're making on this online service.
4062000	4065000	Like, how much is a year? Is it, like, 20 bucks a year or something like that?
4065000	4066000	Yeah.
4066000	4069000	That's like two fucking games on virtual console.
4069000	4076000	Like, it's stupid. It doesn't make any fucking sense that they're doing it this way.
4076000	4079000	Like, I don't get it.
4079000	4083000	This Switch is obviously powerful enough to run Super Nintendo games.
4083000	4088000	The Wii was. I mean, come on. I don't understand why they would do this.
4088000	4091000	Unless they're really going to amp up the emulator.
4091000	4095000	Like, maybe some type of, like, shared scoreboard amongst your friends or something.
4095000	4097000	I mean, I know. Don't hold your fucking breath.
4097000	4101000	But it could be something that maybe the emulator's going to get kicked up.
4101000	4105000	Like, it's going to be more surprising what it does. I don't know.
4105000	4106000	I'm trying to give them something.
4106000	4110000	Other emulators out there have already done this shit, like, long time ago.
4110000	4113000	Like, probably a decade ago, this stuff has been in place.
4113000	4119000	And Nintendo's now just, like, thinking about, maybe we'll do this or maybe we'll do this.
4119000	4122000	It's, like, it's so dumb. I don't even understand.
4122000	4124000	They're literally leaving money on the table.
4124000	4128000	As Joe and Hunter Matt points out, we got skunked at E3 with online news.
4128000	4130000	I wish we'd get a direct about any updates.
4130000	4133000	You know, I've thought about this and the fact that they tend to,
4133000	4138000	and the E3s do tend to be pretty absent of online updates and things like that.
4138000	4141000	And I think, you know, I think I'm okay with it at this point
4141000	4144000	because you have to really think about what is E3 supposed to be.
4144000	4149000	It is a trade show at its core that is supposed to be kind of promoting
4149000	4152000	what the retail lineup is going to be at the end of the year
4152000	4154000	and what you're going to be able to find on store shelves.
4154000	4157000	And this type of thing, you know, even though, yes,
4157000	4160000	the industry is starting to move more and more towards digital and all that,
4160000	4164000	this sort of thing is not really something that is, like,
4164000	4168000	they need to show off to a third party or get other people interested in it.
4168000	4170000	It's very kind of, like, in-house.
4170000	4173000	And so they only need to get their fans on board with it.
4173000	4176000	How do they reach out to their fans? By doing a direct.
4176000	4178000	Does that make sense? What I'm saying is that the Switch Online
4178000	4181000	is not something that ends up on a store shelf, essentially.
4181000	4185000	So maybe they don't feel like E3 is the time to be doing that
4185000	4188000	because it is very much something that they just kind of do in-house
4188000	4190000	and then, blip, put it out there when it's done
4190000	4193000	and there's no middleman, no nothing. Does that make sense?
4193000	4197000	That makes sense. They do this all, I mean, they don't put everything out,
4197000	4199000	like, during E3 anyways.
4199000	4201000	And I don't think they even did that for online last year.
4201000	4206000	It was more towards, I think it was a few weeks away from when they launched in September.
4206000	4211000	So I expect that we'll see something kind of in the middle of August anyways
4211000	4214000	for online, kind of an update or whatever.
4214000	4217000	We'll probably have a couple more directs between then.
4217000	4222000	It's just, it's disappointing, though, that we don't know what's coming out.
4222000	4225000	And it's just, I don't know, like, if they're just like,
4225000	4227000	we're going to launch Super Nintendo games.
4227000	4230000	Like, at this point, I'm not even really that excited about it.
4230000	4234000	Like, I have a Super NES Mini or whatever.
4234000	4238000	Like, the only thing I can think of them holding off on doing, like, more NES games and stuff
4238000	4243000	is that they're planning on releasing a version 2 of those with different games on them
4243000	4248000	and maybe do that. I mean, but I don't know who that's even for at that point.
4248000	4250000	I mean, I don't know.
4250000	4254000	Well, let's travel back to a simpler time.
4254000	4258000	Let's travel back to a console that's so old
4258000	4263000	that we were seeing ports of games on it and emulation.
4263000	4267000	Like, probably at the time, most people did own only a Super Nintendo and things like that.
4267000	4270000	In our segment, the classic game of the week.
4270000	4273000	Usually, Dark Sakura steps into the gaming vault and pulls out a game that she thinks,
4273000	4276000	hey, you guys should check out this game. You should play this game this week.
4276000	4278000	But she is not here tonight, of course.
4278000	4283000	She has the night off as she is celebrating Pride in San Francisco with her sisters this weekend.
4283000	4286000	So, usually, I would bring a guest on.
4286000	4288000	I've really been trying to do that in 2019.
4288000	4293000	But since I cut it so close today with me being out of town and doing other things,
4293000	4294000	I didn't even get to do that.
4294000	4296000	So, I'm picking one myself tonight.
4296000	4298000	So, I'm doing a way, way throwback.
4298000	4301000	And we haven't really spotlighted enough games on this console.
4301000	4306000	So, I picked a game tonight from the Atari 2600.
4306000	4310000	And so, my classic game of the week we're doing tonight is
4310000	4317000	an old game by Activision that's called Oink.
4317000	4318000	So, there it is.
4318000	4322000	Oink is the game that we're going to look at tonight.
4322000	4325000	And the sound kind of gets really annoying.
4325000	4328000	So, I'm going to turn it way down so it doesn't get too crazy here.
4328000	4331000	So, Oink was an Atari 2600 video game.
4331000	4334000	And the designer behind the game was Mike Lorenzen.
4334000	4337000	And then Activision did the release in the year 1983.
4337000	4340000	Oink is the Three Little Pigs, basically.
4340000	4342000	It's a video game based around the Three Little Pigs.
4342000	4344000	For those that can see the video on Twitch right now,
4344000	4348000	you'll notice the brick building, quote-unquote brick building, is yellow.
4348000	4350000	It's supposed to represent straw.
4350000	4352000	The next level is brown.
4352000	4353000	It represents sticks.
4353000	4356000	And then the last level is red because it represents bricks.
4356000	4357000	Get it? It's like the fable.
4357000	4360000	And this is kind of like a reverse breakout sort of thing.
4360000	4363000	So, you have the pig, and you're playing the pig at the top,
4363000	4369000	that is trying to fill in the holes that are being blown up by the wolf.
4369000	4371000	Now, the wolf, I say reverse breakout.
4371000	4373000	It's not like the wolf is bouncing a hole around.
4373000	4376000	But the wolf is kind of shooting this laser beam
4376000	4379000	that is supposed to be representative of the wolf's breath.
4379000	4381000	And he can only fire it every so often.
4381000	4385000	And he uses that to actually knock out the bricks
4385000	4389000	probably a slight bit faster than you can actually lay them down.
4389000	4394000	He can also, with that little stream, his little laser beam, his breath,
4394000	4399000	he can actually pull the pig down to the bottom of the board.
4399000	4401000	So, that way the pig has to take a few seconds,
4401000	4404000	a few valuable seconds to run back up
4404000	4407000	and actually replace, you know, to get the bricks to keep replacing.
4407000	4412000	And if the wolf can succeed in pulling the pig down all the way
4412000	4414000	through like a complete opening in there,
4414000	4416000	because you can see again on the Twitch video,
4416000	4418000	the wolf is about to like make a big enough opening
4418000	4421000	where if he grabs the pig, the pig is going to come completely full,
4421000	4425000	completely through, then the round is over and it goes on to the next house.
4425000	4427000	So, that is essentially the game.
4427000	4429000	I know I make it sound very complicated,
4429000	4432000	but just imagine like a reverse breakout where you are laying down the bricks.
4432000	4437000	The wolf has a name in the story, Bigelow B. Wolf, or B.B. Wolf.
4437000	4443000	And again, you have three houses and the bricks are three layers deep.
4443000	4446000	And if you get pulled completely through,
4446000	4447000	which I think is going to happen on the Twitch stream here in a minute,
4447000	4449000	because that hole is getting really big,
4449000	4453000	then that round is over and you are going to start a new round here.
4453000	4457000	You get four points when you put a brick down on the wall.
4457000	4461000	And if you, you have to use every, there he goes, see he got pulled through,
4461000	4465000	so now he is going to run off and now the straw one is going to come in here,
4465000	4467000	so now he is down to one life basically.
4467000	4469000	And I think it goes a little bit faster with each board.
4469000	4471000	And I think you get more points too.
4471000	4475000	I think it is four points the first time and then like as each new row comes in,
4475000	4477000	you get like a multiplier basically.
4477000	4480000	So the wolf attacks also speed up.
4480000	4483000	So you can't keep this going forever really.
4483000	4487000	Now here is the thing that a lot of people don't realize about this game
4487000	4492000	and what I think makes it actually really notable is because,
4492000	4496000	and even the Wiki article doesn't talk about this, which I found very surprising.
4496000	4501000	You have to actually kind of dig a little deeper or remember this mode like I do.
4501000	4503000	If you actually can find a copy of the game manual,
4503000	4506000	the game manual explains how there are actually three game modes.
4506000	4509000	Because remember the Atari had that switch which recycled the different game modes.
4509000	4513000	So game mode number one is one player versus the wolf.
4513000	4517000	Game mode number two is take turns controlling each pig,
4517000	4519000	two players versus the wolf.
4519000	4524000	But here is where I think this game really shined was game number three.
4524000	4528000	One player controls the pig, one player controls the wolf.
4528000	4532000	And so it was really like an early example that I can think of,
4532000	4536000	of like a player versus player type of thing in video games
4536000	4540000	where the players had two completely different types of mechanics.
4540000	4541000	Does that make sense?
4541000	4542000	Yeah.
4542000	4544000	So yeah, I think that's what made this game kind of notable
4544000	4547000	and one reason that I wanted to spotlight it tonight
4547000	4552000	is because it was really like a different type of battle your friends type of game.
4552000	4554000	And I do remember playing this game with my friends
4554000	4558000	and we would battle and see who could get the higher score
4558000	4560000	and it was what we did
4560000	4563000	because that's as far progressed as the video games were at that point.
4563000	4567000	So you can also use difficulty switches.
4567000	4571000	In the A position your pigs have to walk down to the wall to drop an object in place.
4571000	4574000	In the B position they can drop objects from anywhere on the screen.
4574000	4577000	So the A position is a lot harder.
4577000	4580000	Anyway, for those that did continue to play in the single player mode,
4580000	4584000	in the single player mode if you were able to score, I think it was 25,000 points,
4584000	4589000	you could take the picture of your TV screen and get the old school achievements,
4589000	4592000	the actual patches that Activision would mail you
4592000	4594000	for you to put on, I don't know, your jacket or whatever,
4594000	4598000	and you get an oinker's patch.
4598000	4603000	So as far as a lot of the follow up and reception and so forth,
4603000	4609000	apparently Oink got an award of the most humorous video game computer game in 1984.
4609000	4611000	I guess it's funny. I don't know.
4611000	4614000	I mean a video game called Oink is kind of funny.
4614000	4616000	They could have called the game The Three Little Pigs
4616000	4618000	and it would have made just as much sense,
4618000	4620000	but instead they called it Oink.
4620000	4622000	You know, squeal like a pig I guess.
4622000	4624000	If you would like to check out this game,
4624000	4627000	you could check out a collection called the Activision Anthology,
4627000	4631000	but otherwise I don't know if this one shows up on the flashback consoles.
4631000	4634000	I think I have seen it on some of those Atari flashback consoles,
4634000	4637000	the one that included Atari 2600 games,
4637000	4640000	but it's missing from a lot of them.
4640000	4647000	So anyway, I'm looking in chat over at twitch.tv slash vognetwork.
4647000	4650000	Darktichia says, whoa, a competitive mode.
4650000	4651000	Okay, that's neat.
4651000	4654000	Yeah, it's kind of what made it special a little bit, I think,
4654000	4656000	and worthy of highlighting this week.
4656000	4659000	And PixelPaka says, the oinker's patch is cute.
4659000	4661000	It sure is.
4661000	4663000	And definitely would have a whole new meaning for some people.
4663000	4665000	Just putting it out there.
4665000	4668000	Metal Mayhem says, I never had this game for the 2600.
4668000	4672000	I don't think this was as well known, and that's part of the reason.
4672000	4678000	Activision had a lot of real big games for the Atari 2600.
4678000	4682000	River Raid, Pitfall certainly was a big one.
4682000	4683000	They had a lot.
4683000	4686000	I don't think Oink was ever really one of their big successes,
4686000	4689000	but I think, again, because of this two-player mode that I was talking about,
4689000	4691000	it's a pretty big deal that I think is worth spotlighting.
4691000	4692000	So there you go.
4692000	4693000	Oh, Kaboom! Thank you, YYR.
4693000	4694000	Yeah, there's a lot of them.
4694000	4698000	And YYR says, this game looks great, and I'm sad I never heard about it until now.
4698000	4699000	Thank you.
4699000	4701000	I'm happy to help educate.
4701000	4704000	That's part of what we do here at Orange Lounge Radio
4704000	4706000	in the Classic Game of the Week.
4706000	4709000	Now you guys are all naming all the Atari games I'm forgetting.
4709000	4712000	H-E-R-O, Keystone Capers, yes, yes.
4712000	4714000	I'm going to cross my fingers and toes.
4714000	4716000	Maybe some of those will show up on Antstream or something.
4716000	4718000	I don't think Antstream has the Atari 2600 stuff yet,
4718000	4721000	but hopefully that's something they're going to grow to in the future.
4721000	4724000	Well, that's supposed to be the Atari console that they've got.
4724000	4725000	Oh, yeah.
4725000	4726000	Well, after that.
4726000	4728000	Well, they still may put it on there.
4728000	4730000	Technically, these are Activision's games, too,
4730000	4731000	so you never know what will happen.
4731000	4732000	That's true.
4732000	4735000	And actually, speaking of Antstream real quick,
4735000	4738000	their official launch is tomorrow in the UK,
4738000	4741000	so they actually aren't launching in the US right away.
4741000	4743000	They're going to start in the UK, because that's where they're based.
4743000	4746000	But I guess us early backers, and disclosure, I'm a backer,
4746000	4748000	that got in in the US, we get to keep it,
4748000	4750000	but they're going to start the new game releases coming up pretty soon.
4750000	4751000	Oh, cool.
4751000	4754000	When are they launching officially everything?
4754000	4755000	For the UK? Tomorrow.
4755000	4756000	Oh, US, too.
4756000	4757000	They haven't set it for the US yet.
4757000	4760000	So they're doing that for non-backers, too, at some point?
4760000	4761000	Yeah.
4761000	4763000	Non-backers in the UK can get in tomorrow, basically.
4763000	4764000	Cool.
4764000	4768000	So they haven't said if we're talking months, weeks, or what.
4768000	4771000	I imagine they want to launch, make sure it's smooth, stable,
4771000	4772000	all that good stuff.
4772000	4775000	And then I don't think the US will wait that long.
4775000	4777000	So we'll see, though.
4777000	4780000	Anyway, all right.
4780000	4781000	Let's move on.
4781000	4783000	Sadly, no video segment this week.
4783000	4786000	I didn't have time to make one with everything else going on,
4786000	4788000	although Loki's looking at doing some stuff, right?
4788000	4791000	Yeah, I was going to do some stuff, but I haven't filmed anything yet.
4791000	4794000	I will use this opportunity to give you guys a reminder.
4794000	4797000	We played a little promotional video at the beginning of the stream tonight,
4797000	4799000	and we will play it again at the end,
4799000	4804000	just because VOG Network is a sponsor of the Southern Fried Game Room Expo
4804000	4807000	that's coming up in the Atlanta area this July.
4807000	4812000	And Bobby Black Wolf is going to be there in person and attending the festival.
4812000	4815000	And so if you are in the Southeast, if you're in the Atlanta area,
4815000	4818000	you want to play some old-school video games, maybe they'll have Oink.
4818000	4820000	Who knows? I bet you they've got some consoles set up and stuff,
4820000	4823000	but I know they do a lot of arcade, a lot of pinball.
4823000	4826000	I did see the Atari flashback in that promo video.
4826000	4827000	Yeah, and there's a lot.
4827000	4829000	They had Rasslin in there, too, because...
4829000	4830000	That's weird.
4830000	4832000	Why not? Well, why not? DragonCon has Rasslin.
4832000	4833000	Oh, okay.
4833000	4835000	I guess there's a lot of crossover. Why not?
4835000	4836000	But anyway, that's happening.
4836000	4838000	I believe the dates are the 12th through the 14th in the Atlanta area.
4838000	4841000	We just want to shout them out, because VOG Network is a sponsor of that.
4841000	4844000	And shit, we just love old-school video games.
4844000	4847000	So a convention set up to love old-school video games
4847000	4850000	and maybe a few new-school ones, too, and throw in some Rasslin as well.
4850000	4852000	Hey, we're on board.
4852000	4855000	So check that out and go say hi to Bobby Black Wolf.
4855000	4858000	If you can't make that, I really hope you will try to make DragonCon,
4858000	4861000	which I will be at and Bobby will be at.
4861000	4864000	And if you're a longtime fan of VOG and you remember shows like
4864000	4866000	Guys on a Show or Hoard House,
4866000	4869000	Xtaphir will be at DragonCon this year for the very first time.
4870000	4875000	Travis Donovan is back at, I hope, well wishes Travis Donovan out there,
4875000	4877000	by the way, if you're out there.
4877000	4879000	I don't know how much of his business I can put out there,
4879000	4884000	but he had a routine surgery that is completely normal
4884000	4885000	and just well wishes.
4885000	4886000	I hope he's doing well.
4886000	4888000	As far as I know, we'll still make DragonCon,
4888000	4890000	because he's got plenty of time to recover and all that good stuff.
4890000	4895000	So yeah, so lots of VOG personalities.
4895000	4898000	I don't remember if Brian from British Invaders is going this year
4898000	4900000	or John from Critical Myth.
4900000	4901000	I haven't checked on the status of those.
4901000	4903000	I'm sure Gary from Critical Myth will be there.
4903000	4905000	I know some of these shows have sunsetted,
4905000	4908000	but it's still good to see them and hang out once a year.
4908000	4910000	So DragonCon is coming up as well, Labor Day weekend.
4910000	4911000	Very excited.
4911000	4914000	I don't know how much I'm allowed to say yet,
4914000	4919000	but I will say that I have seen an early draft of what Bobby and I
4919000	4921000	are going to be involved with.
4921000	4924000	And like last year, we did several panels and stuff,
4924000	4927000	so you can probably guess there's going to be a similar thing
4927000	4928000	going on this year.
4928000	4932000	And I'm really excited about some of the stuff I'm seeing.
4932000	4935000	There are some panels this year, especially one for me,
4935000	4938000	where I'm like, I'm hyped about this.
4938000	4939000	This is going to be great.
4939000	4942000	So I'll tease you with that and more details to come in future weeks.
4942000	4944000	Okay, now we'll get back into some gaming news
4944000	4947000	and tackle some rapid-fire news.
4947000	4951000	All right, so let's talk about some stuff we're going to get for free.
4951000	4955000	Well, not necessarily free, because you're paying for those online services.
4955000	4957000	But Games of Gold and PlayStation Plus.
4957000	4960000	So Games of Gold in July.
4960000	4964000	We are getting Inside from July 1st to the 31st,
4964000	4969000	and Big Crown Showdown from July 16th through the 15th.
4969000	4972000	And then on the Xbox 360 backwards compatible games,
4972000	4976000	Castlevania Symphony of the Night from July 1st through the 15th,
4976000	4978000	and then the really old movie tie-in,
4978000	4983000	Meet the Robinsons from July 16th through the 31st.
4984000	4986000	It was an okay movie. I liked it.
4986000	4991000	You know, I talked to someone recently that had not played Castlevania Symphony of the Night,
4991000	4994000	and I was trying to explain, like, Bloodstained,
4994000	4998000	because it was a game that I had planned to play that evening and never got around to.
4998000	5000000	And I was like, oh, it's kind of like Castlevania Symphony of the Night,
5000000	5002000	and this person I was talking to didn't really know about it.
5002000	5005000	And I was like, oh, man, you got to check it out if you ever have time.
5005000	5008000	And then it was so funny that this came up today.
5008000	5012000	I saw this, and I was like, oh, shit, this would be nice if this person has an Xbox.
5012000	5015000	They're going to be able to get it for free coming up here soon, so it's pretty cool.
5015000	5019000	PlayStation Plus, we're going to be getting two games, of course.
5019000	5026000	So Pro Evolution Soccer 2019 and Horizon Chase Zero
5026000	5030000	are going to be the two games that we get for PlayStation.
5030000	5032000	I know not everybody's into Pro Evo Soccer,
5032000	5035000	but it's nice to kind of see a sports game that's happening.
5035000	5039000	Okay, so Mr. Smoosh is exploring the kitchen counter.
5039000	5043000	I need to go discourage him from doing so because he's getting a little, yeah.
5043000	5046000	So, Loki, if you wouldn't mind just buying me some time.
5046000	5047000	Sure, of course.
5048000	5049000	Ah, cats.
5049000	5053000	Anyways, and then let's talk a little bit about Crackdown 3,
5053000	5056000	a game I haven't been back to since I originally beat it.
5056000	5058000	But now I have a reason to go back
5058000	5062000	because there's going to be a brand new update coming to it pretty soon.
5062000	5065000	It's called the Flying High update,
5065000	5069000	and it adds a wingsuit into the game,
5069000	5076000	as well as apparently some other updates or other achievements.
5076000	5080000	So 16 achievements, totaling 500 gamer score.
5080000	5082000	And I don't know what else.
5082000	5085000	Oh, the Agency Peacekeeper Beacon,
5085000	5089000	which you can use for callings in civilian backup.
5089000	5091000	And they said an elemental forge,
5091000	5095000	and a hellstorm flare for air strikes,
5095000	5098000	and some cluster duck grenade.
5098000	5100000	Cluster duck?
5100000	5104000	Well, yeah, they had kind of a silly thing with the original Crackdown game.
5104000	5106000	I think it was a pre-order bonus or something like that
5106000	5109000	where you get an exploding rubber duck,
5109000	5112000	and you can use that as a grenade.
5112000	5115000	But, I don't know.
5115000	5117000	I'll check it out.
5117000	5120000	Meh.
5120000	5122000	And that's what they wrote.
5122000	5123000	Meh.
5123000	5124000	I still need to play Crackdown 3.
5124000	5127000	I have the Xbox Pass now, so I just...
5127000	5128000	Yeah, you should try it.
5128000	5130000	Add that to the fucking list of games I need to catch up on.
5130000	5132000	It's all right, but I got a LARP.
5132000	5136000	It's only a few hours to beat the game.
5136000	5138000	And it's good, and you're just like, eh, cool.
5138000	5141000	Well, ironically, we were talking about Battle Royale games earlier,
5141000	5143000	and there's another one coming out, Tetris Royale.
5144000	5147000	Wait a minute. Don't we already have Tetris Battle Royale?
5147000	5149000	Of course we do. Tetris 99, of course.
5149000	5151000	But there's a new one coming out.
5151000	5153000	Maybe because of the success of Tetris 99.
5153000	5155000	I don't know. Tetris Royale.
5155000	5157000	Tetris Royale is a cell phone game.
5157000	5159000	It's an iOS Android game. It's not a Switch game.
5159000	5161000	So that's, ah, there's the difference there.
5161000	5163000	Tetris Royale is what they call it in the UK
5163000	5165000	because they're on the metric system.
5165000	5167000	They don't have a quarter pound. Yes, yes.
5167000	5170000	Anyway, no footage right now
5170000	5172000	because I guess it's early on or whatever.
5172000	5174000	But of course Tetris Royale, they are saying
5174000	5176000	we'll have a variety of game modes from
5176000	5178000	100 players, not 99, but 100 players
5178000	5180000	battling Tetris with each other
5180000	5182000	to daily competitions
5182000	5184000	and so on and so on.
5184000	5186000	I think the, ah,
5186000	5188000	who is developing this one?
5188000	5190000	It's not the same developers.
5190000	5192000	Because the developers of Tetris 99
5192000	5194000	are also the people behind the Grandmaster.
5194000	5196000	And they are not doing this one.
5196000	5198000	So somebody else kind of licensed Tetris.
5198000	5200000	Let's hope it's not Ubisoft.
5200000	5202000	No, it's not. It's not Ubisoft. It's somebody else.
5202000	5204000	Ah, and, um,
5204000	5206000	oh, okay, no, it is Network.
5206000	5208000	N3 TWORK.
5208000	5210000	That's doing it because they
5210000	5212000	got the multi-year contract to
5212000	5214000	exclusively develop and publish
5214000	5216000	new Tetris games built from the ground up
5216000	5218000	for mobile devices worldwide
5218000	5220000	excluding China.
5220000	5222000	So. I would have been really
5222000	5224000	interested in this if this was Hatris
5224000	5226000	Battle Royale, but, you know. Or FaceTris?
5226000	5228000	FaceTris. Or WordTris?
5228000	5230000	Uh,
5230000	5232000	Nifty 805 is asking, don't you all have
5232000	5234000	phones?
5234000	5236000	It's the hot new way to play, ah, Tetris.
5236000	5238000	So. Ah, DarkTitsu, you're reminding
5238000	5240000	us the name of the developer of Tetris 99
5240000	5242000	who I failed to mention. Ah, Arica.
5242000	5244000	Is, ah, the developer that did
5244000	5246000	Tetris 99, so. And ActDeft
5246000	5248000	in chat saying, we need a new Tetris Grandmaster
5248000	5250000	dammit. Ah, I think there'd be a lot of people
5250000	5252000	happy to see that if that actually happened over here.
5252000	5254000	You know, the good news is Switch is region free, so they
5254000	5256000	did it on the Switch and they even put it out only in Japan
5256000	5258000	and you can still kind of get it here. And it's Tetris,
5258000	5260000	so you wouldn't have to have a deep understanding of Japanese.
5260000	5262000	We'll see. I don't know.
5262000	5264000	Anyway. Ah, moving
5264000	5266000	on to talking about, oh, this is interesting.
5266000	5268000	This is a follow up to the little
5268000	5270000	Commodore 64 mini that you got me last week.
5270000	5272000	Which, thanks again. No problem.
5272000	5274000	Um, and, ah, you mentioned it was on a deep
5274000	5276000	discount, which is part of the reason why you got it.
5276000	5278000	You're like, oh, I'll get it now. And I said, I think
5278000	5280000	it's because they're making a new one. Well, guess what, Logie?
5280000	5282000	They're making a new one. So,
5282000	5284000	the deal is, is that they're putting out a
5284000	5286000	new version with a full size
5286000	5288000	keyboard and they're simply calling it
5288000	5290000	the C64 micro
5290000	5292000	computer. It's going to have the
5292000	5294000	same 64 games in it, but
5294000	5296000	this time the keyboard is fully sized
5296000	5298000	and fully functional. So you don't have to use
5298000	5300000	like a separate USB keyboard to get
5300000	5302000	in there and actually do the typing. You use that keyboard.
5302000	5304000	What's also interesting about it, in my
5304000	5306000	opinion, is that it is going to emulate not
5306000	5308000	just Commodore 64, but
5308000	5310000	VIC-20. So, which
5310000	5312000	was kind of the predecessor
5312000	5314000	to Commodore 64. No word
5314000	5316000	on Commodore 128
5316000	5318000	or the, what was the other one,
5318000	5320000	the 16 plus
5320000	5322000	4C or whatever the other one was.
5322000	5324000	There was another Commodore
5324000	5326000	that came out. I don't think it did well here at all.
5326000	5328000	When did we get our Amiga?
5328000	5330000	Hell yeah!
5330000	5332000	Why not an Amiga thing? I don't know, we'll see.
5332000	5334000	Well, that's the platform,
5334000	5336000	that's the thing, and stream
5336000	5338000	has a lot of Amiga stuff in it right now.
5338000	5340000	So, you can't
5340000	5342000	get your Amiga life through that.
5342000	5344000	I mean, a lot of the stuff that was big in the UK.
5344000	5346000	Amiga, Spectrum, they have some Commodore 64
5346000	5348000	in there as well. You know,
5348000	5350000	the Amstream retro stuff is covering a lot of that.
5350000	5352000	So, anyway, otherwise it's going to be pretty
5352000	5354000	much similar to the
5354000	5356000	Commodore 64 mini that's already out,
5356000	5358000	but the larger keyboard is definitely going to be a game
5358000	5360000	changer. The resolution output is
5360000	5362000	maxed at 720p, so sorry
5362000	5364000	you will not be able to play games in 4K
5364000	5366000	all of a sudden. December 5th, 2019
5366000	5368000	is supposedly the day that this new one
5368000	5370000	is going to ship. So that is still
5370000	5372000	a little ways out, but just about close enough.
5372000	5374000	Considering the resolution of what it is
5374000	5376000	anyways, 720p
5376000	5378000	upscale to 4K is going to
5378000	5380000	look the same, I would imagine.
5380000	5382000	And it's Commodore 64, it's just like
5382000	5384000	the edges get edgier,
5384000	5386000	that's about it, right?
5386000	5388000	Alright, anyhow.
5388000	5390000	Moving on
5390000	5392000	and talking about
5392000	5394000	what's going to come out in stores near
5394000	5396000	you very soon as we travel around the world
5396000	5398000	and look at world release dates.
5398000	5400000	So, the US, Loki.
5400000	5402000	So, of course, as you're aware, Final Fantasy XIV Shadowbringers
5402000	5404000	is going to be coming out this week on PC and
5404000	5406000	PlayStation 4. Officially.
5406000	5408000	Alternate Jake Hunter
5408000	5410000	Daedalus, The Awakening of the Golden Jazz.
5412000	5414000	I have no idea what the fuck that is,
5414000	5416000	but that's an amazing title.
5416000	5418000	Coming out on PC.
5418000	5420000	Stranger Things 3, the game.
5420000	5422000	That's coming out on PC, PlayStation 4,
5422000	5424000	Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch.
5424000	5426000	Also the show coming out on the 4th as well.
5426000	5428000	Clonad on
5428000	5430000	Nintendo Switch. The Ninja Warriors
5430000	5432000	once again on Nintendo
5432000	5434000	Switch and PlayStation 4.
5434000	5436000	Attack on Titan 2, Final
5436000	5438000	Battle on PlayStation 4,
5438000	5440000	Xbox One, Switch, and PC.
5440000	5442000	Sea of Solitude on
5442000	5444000	PC,
5444000	5446000	PlayStation 4, and
5446000	5448000	Xbox One. And
5448000	5450000	that's it.
5450000	5452000	Alright, traveling over to Japan real quick.
5452000	5454000	A pretty similar lineup
5454000	5456000	with Final Fantasy XIV, of course,
5456000	5458000	making its way in Japan officially
5458000	5460000	this week on the 2nd. The same day
5460000	5462000	it's out everywhere else officially.
5462000	5464000	But there's just a
5464000	5466000	few releases here on July 4th in
5466000	5468000	Japan. Remember, it's a holiday
5468000	5470000	in the US, but not Japan. So they get game releases
5470000	5472000	on July 4th. So the
5472000	5474000	games coming out on PS4 are
5474000	5476000	Pixark and
5476000	5478000	Shingeki no Kaioshin 2
5478000	5480000	Final Battle from Koei
5480000	5482000	Tecmo is the big release.
5482000	5484000	Attack on Titan 2. That's it.
5484000	5486000	Those are the big releases on the PlayStation 4.
5486000	5488000	And then the Switch, those
5488000	5490000	exact same games, but that
5490000	5492000	Clonad game is the other big release in
5492000	5494000	Japan this week. So kind of a lot of overlap
5494000	5496000	this week. How about the UK?
5496000	5498000	UK, we've got
5498000	5500000	looks like Red Faction
5500000	5502000	Guerrilla Remarse edition
5502000	5504000	that's going to be coming out.
5504000	5506000	We've got, oh that's
5506000	5508000	on Nintendo Switch. Final Fantasy
5508000	5510000	XIV Shadowbringers on
5510000	5512000	PC and PlayStation 4.
5512000	5514000	Attack on Titan 2. The Final Battle
5514000	5516000	on PC, PlayStation, I'm sorry
5516000	5518000	PlayStation 4, Xbox One and
5518000	5520000	Switch. Tour de France on
5520000	5522000	Xbox One.
5522000	5524000	We have Sirento
5524000	5526000	VR on PlayStation 4.
5526000	5528000	And that's it.
5528000	5530000	Alright. Let's move on
5530000	5532000	to the mailbag. Every week we invite you
5532000	5534000	to email us. Participate at
5534000	5536000	orangelandre.com and we read
5536000	5538000	your emails here live on the show.
5538000	5540000	I think we just have one quick one
5540000	5542000	tonight coming in this week from
5542000	5544000	Redertainment. So yeah,
5544000	5546000	Redertainment sent us an email this week to participate
5546000	5548000	at orangelandre.com and I
5548000	5550000	encourage you to email us. Fill up that mailbag
5550000	5552000	who says, hello peoples.
5552000	5554000	I'm at Salt Lake Gaming Con
5554000	5556000	and there's a pinball table that is really
5556000	5558000	outstanding to me. It's Genie
5558000	5560000	by Gottlieb. It's a
5560000	5562000	four player competitive old style
5562000	5564000	multi flipper table.
5564000	5566000	It's the kind of thing that I would buy if I had the space
5566000	5568000	and money. And that is signed from
5568000	5570000	Redertainment saying this message was
5570000	5572000	brought to you by cool shit you only
5572000	5574000	see at cons. He actually sent a little
5574000	5576000	picture. It's a little bit low resolution for me
5576000	5578000	to actually show on the stream
5578000	5580000	and it ended up coming through tilted sideways.
5580000	5582000	But it is one of those old school like
5582000	5584000	70's-ish kind of machines.
5584000	5586000	I believe I've played this table
5586000	5588000	and I think I played it recently when I was at the pinball
5588000	5590000	Hall of Fame in Vegas
5590000	5592000	which I talked about several weeks ago.
5592000	5594000	God, it was probably closer to the end
5594000	5596000	of last year. No, where the hell was I
5596000	5598000	in Vegas? I can't remember anymore.
5598000	5600000	But yeah, it was closer to the end of last year I think.
5600000	5602000	I played it recently when I was there.
5602000	5604000	And yeah, I'll pass that along
5604000	5606000	to Jamie because she'll get a kick out of that.
5606000	5608000	But yeah, old school pinball tables.
5608000	5610000	It's always kind of fun to go back and discover stuff
5610000	5612000	especially in that 70. You know, because
5612000	5614000	a lot of like, if you play this stuff from like the 60's
5614000	5616000	and you know, they're really
5616000	5618000	old and they're cool.
5618000	5620000	They still have a lot of like replay value
5620000	5622000	and stuff. There's just not as much
5622000	5624000	going on necessarily.
5624000	5626000	But you know, you really start to see
5626000	5628000	that phase when things started going from the
5628000	5630000	little spinning numbers to the digital numbers
5630000	5632000	and the boards started getting more digital
5632000	5634000	themselves and more lights and things like that.
5634000	5636000	Like there's just a lot of like neat stuff that
5636000	5638000	came out such as you know, multi flippers
5638000	5640000	and things like that. So yeah, very
5640000	5642000	cool. So I'm glad. It sounds like this
5642000	5644000	Salt Lake Con that
5644000	5646000	Retertainment was at is probably very similar to like
5646000	5648000	Southern Fry Game Room Expo and there's probably many
5648000	5650000	cons like it in cities throughout America
5650000	5652000	where you can go experience some of these
5652000	5654000	things. So, pretty cool.
5654000	5656000	But that wasn't really our only email
5656000	5658000	this week. So participate at
5658000	5660000	orangelaundry.com if you would like to send us
5660000	5662000	an email for a future week. Hey, we don't mind
5662000	5664000	the shout outs of things that you guys see
5664000	5666000	at Gaming Cons. We really love
5666000	5668000	video though, because then we can put that
5668000	5670000	in the middle of our show. So think about that.
5670000	5672000	Anyway, don't you all have cell phones?
5672000	5674000	Don't they all shoot video?
5674000	5676000	Alright.
5676000	5678000	All that aside, let's move on and
5678000	5680000	talk about some more headlines,
5680000	5682000	some things we've kind of referenced so
5682000	5684000	far. Right, Logie? Yes. So speaking
5684000	5686000	of cell phones, if you have a cell phone
5686000	5688000	you can check out Flappy
5688000	5690000	Royale. It is a
5690000	5692000	battle royale flappy
5692000	5694000	bird type game. I use
5694000	5696000	air quotes because it's not necessarily
5696000	5698000	that you're battling each other. This is battle royale
5698000	5700000	as in the same as the Mario
5700000	5702000	battle royale was battle royale
5702000	5704000	where you're playing at the same time
5704000	5706000	trying to accomplish something
5706000	5708000	but
5708000	5710000	it's a flappy bird so you're probably going to die pretty
5710000	5712000	fast. Yes. And
5712000	5714000	for one, it's not easy
5714000	5716000	to get on iOS. You have to
5716000	5718000	do the whole test flight thing
5718000	5720000	which I've only ever used when I
5720000	5722000	was in the Pokemon Go beta so long
5722000	5724000	ago for being a high level Ingress player. I installed
5724000	5726000	test flight and I've since uninstalled it because I didn't
5726000	5728000	need it for anything else. But you can
5728000	5730000	play it in a browser window. That's
5730000	5732000	how I played it. So I did play this
5732000	5734000	earlier just to check it out.
5734000	5736000	And one thing that I noticed when I played it
5736000	5738000	is that there's no
5738000	5740000	way that you're actually
5740000	5742000	matching live with other people. There's
5742000	5744000	no way that's happening because
5744000	5746000	if you fuck up, you go right
5746000	5748000	back into it. So I think
5748000	5750000	what it is, it's probably downloading
5750000	5752000	99 other shadows.
5752000	5754000	I'm not saying it's like a fake battle royale.
5754000	5756000	It might be, but I would
5756000	5758000	see maybe that, and like you said, this Mario
5758000	5760000	thing that Nintendo pulled I think was like this
5760000	5762000	is that you're basically running against
5762000	5764000	99 shadows of
5764000	5766000	other people running. And I think
5766000	5768000	that's probably what's really happening, but it's
5768000	5770000	not happening live like it
5770000	5772000	would be in a game like Fortnite or
5772000	5774000	even Tetris 99.
5774000	5776000	But I thought it was a hilarious concept.
5776000	5778000	I mean, just the whole image, and
5778000	5780000	if you kind of Google this game, the
5780000	5782000	Flappy Royal,
5782000	5784000	you can actually see
5784000	5786000	it's so funny. I love the bus.
5786000	5788000	I love the bus idea. They show up at the bus.
5788000	5790000	But then you just see this swarm of birds, it looks
5790000	5792000	like fucking bees flying everywhere
5792000	5794000	coming out of the bus. You can't even see like
5794000	5796000	who you would be. I guess yours is...
5796000	5798000	Yours is a lot, like you can
5798000	5800000	actually design your character. So you can actually
5800000	5802000	my bird looks like Opa Opa from
5802000	5804000	Fantasy Zone. And then you can actually, like he
5804000	5806000	wears a little hat. So you can actually like customize
5806000	5808000	a little bit. And the one you're controlling
5808000	5810000	does stand out a little
5810000	5812000	more. Like the colors are all filled in a bit
5812000	5814000	more. So
5814000	5816000	it's, it's cute.
5816000	5818000	But I don't think
5818000	5820000	it's quite
5820000	5822000	live battle royale. But I think
5822000	5824000	this, I mean this is probably done by
5824000	5826000	did you say it was one or two developers?
5826000	5828000	Like it's probably just like a couple of people
5828000	5830000	who did this. Yeah, I didn't say who it was. It was
5830000	5832000	basically
5832000	5834000	they have like three
5834000	5836000	developers. Designers Orta,
5836000	5838000	Fearox, M. Laser
5838000	5840000	Walker, and Zach Gage.
5840000	5842000	So four people.
5842000	5844000	Akuma JV says what? Rob's bird looks like what?
5844000	5846000	The lead ship from Fantasy Zone.
5846000	5848000	There's like a clone of that
5848000	5850000	in the game. So.
5850000	5852000	Alright.
5852000	5854000	Yeah, it's one of those things you
5854000	5856000	play. Oh that's cute. And then you
5856000	5858000	probably won't really play again. But you
5858000	5860000	never know. I mean we'll see.
5860000	5862000	Maybe this is a great start.
5862000	5864000	And especially if it's only on Test Flight and things like
5864000	5866000	that. Maybe the developers
5866000	5868000	will think about, oh a way you can battle
5868000	5870000	against your friend's shadows. Or
5870000	5872000	you know certain courses that are already
5872000	5874000	laid out. Like there might be ways
5874000	5876000	to take this concept and make
5876000	5878000	it much more than something you play once
5878000	5880000	and go oh cute and then never play again.
5880000	5882000	Which I think the original Flappy Bird was
5882000	5884000	for a lot of people. But a lot of people
5884000	5886000	played that Flappy Bird.
5886000	5888000	That's one of those amazing
5888000	5890000	kind of mysteries in video games to this day.
5890000	5892000	Why did that guy
5892000	5894000	just pull Flappy Bird when he could have kept making
5894000	5896000	so much money off of it. And he
5896000	5898000	ended up releasing more games.
5898000	5900000	After that he just
5900000	5902000	and I don't know if he licensed some of that stuff
5902000	5904000	out because they have arcade games now and
5904000	5906000	all sorts of crap. And the kids want to drop
5906000	5908000	a dollar into the play Flappy Bird. I'm like are you
5908000	5910000	fucking nuts. But maybe you know I
5910000	5912000	can I can also understand that maybe he's just the fame
5912000	5914000	and the attention and the
5914000	5916000	strange phone calls and the people wanting to do
5916000	5918000	business with you. Like maybe he was just overwhelmed.
5918000	5920000	Yeah play Crossy Road. I got paid a dollar each
5920000	5922000	game to play Crossy Road. I'm like you can
5922000	5924000	play that for free. Why would you pay money.
5924000	5926000	Pay a dollar to play DDR.
5926000	5928000	As YYR says in chat.
5928000	5930000	Daddy I can win tickets.
5930000	5932000	Barely any.
5932000	5934000	And I try to tell them I'm like
5934000	5936000	kid you're not winning enough.
5936000	5938000	Make it worth my while. They're like well I want to
5938000	5940000	play this game. Like OK well you just died
5940000	5942000	and it cost a dollar and you won three tickets.
5942000	5944000	Or you could play this game right here
5944000	5946000	and win like 40 tickets
5946000	5948000	every time. 3 or 40.
5948000	5950000	And then eventually they understand.
5952000	5954000	And they would pay for that $15
5954000	5956000	ring pop that they want.
5956000	5958000	In chat says didn't he say that he feared
5958000	5960000	he would get in trouble because of the popularity of
5960000	5962000	the game because the country he lives in.
5962000	5964000	Yeah I think that was part of it. So I'm not trying to
5964000	5966000	dismiss his
5966000	5968000	you know cautions about why he stopped making
5968000	5970000	the game. But it is one of those things that really just kind of
5970000	5972000	like you know you do take a step back and go wow
5972000	5974000	like somebody walking away from something
5974000	5976000	that could have been even bigger and made
5976000	5978000	even more money. It's like you just don't
5978000	5980000	hear about that in our industry. It's like the one
5980000	5982000	time that ever happened for whatever the reason is.
5982000	5984000	So anyway
5984000	5986000	let's move on and
5986000	5988000	talk about a few more stories.
5988000	5990000	So I believe I'm next with a
5990000	5992000	follow up on the Pokemon
5992000	5994000	Dex controversy.
5994000	5996000	So we got into that on a
5996000	5998000	previous episode where you know the got to catch
5998000	6000000	some of them. Not all the Pokemon
6000000	6002000	are going to be coming over to Sword and Shield
6002000	6004000	and some of the
6004000	6006000	protests if you will the virtual
6006000	6008000	Twitter things and things like that have
6008000	6010000	not really died down and
6010000	6012000	this week Game Freak
6012000	6014000	responded
6014000	6016000	with a producer letter and
6016000	6018000	the producer letter
6018000	6020000	you kind of it was kind of a way
6020000	6022000	of saying I don't know it was a way of saying like
6022000	6024000	we're hearing what you're saying but
6024000	6026000	they didn't they didn't say they were not doing anything
6026000	6028000	about it. Yeah I don't know if I would say they doubled
6028000	6030000	down either. What they basically
6030000	6032000	said was that and let
6032000	6034000	me read some of the kind of well actually
6034000	6036000	let me go to the full letter here maybe I can
6036000	6038000	read some of the longer
6038000	6040000	passages from it. But
6040000	6042000	so yeah
6042000	6044000	I'll just read the whole thing it's not that long.
6044000	6046000	So the letter stated June 28th and it says
6046000	6048000	thank you to all our fans for caring so deeply about
6048000	6050000	Pokemon. Recently I shared the news
6050000	6052000	that some Pokemon cannot be transferred to Pokemon
6052000	6054000	Sword and Pokemon Shield. I've read
6054000	6056000	all your comments and appreciate your love and
6056000	6058000	passion for Pokemon. Just like
6058000	6060000	all of you we are passionate
6060000	6062000	about Pokemon and each and every one of them is very
6062000	6064000	important to us. After so many years
6064000	6066000	of developing the Pokemon video games
6066000	6068000	this is a very difficult decision for me.
6068000	6070000	I'd like to make one thing clear. Even
6070000	6072000	if a specific Pokemon is not available
6072000	6074000	in Pokemon Sword and Shield this does not
6074000	6076000	mean that it will not appear in future
6076000	6078000	games. The world of Pokemon continues
6078000	6080000	to evolve. The Galar region
6080000	6082000	offers new Pokemon to encounter trainers to battle
6082000	6084000	and adventures to embark on. We are pouring
6084000	6086000	our hearts into these games and we hope you will look forward
6086000	6088000	to joining us in this new journey. So essentially
6088000	6090000	he's saying if you
6090000	6092000	are pissed that your Pokemon
6092000	6094000	is not in this game that doesn't mean we're deleting
6094000	6096000	them forever or that they're going to
6096000	6098000	not come back in another Pokemon game
6098000	6100000	because we all know this franchise is not
6100000	6102000	going to go away anytime soon.
6102000	6104000	But I don't know. I think there's a lot of people
6104000	6106000	that are still just
6106000	6108000	irritated. I don't know how else
6108000	6110000	to put it. Let me go to chat.
6110000	6112000	See what some folks are saying there. I know we've got some Pokefans
6112000	6114000	in chat that probably have their own thing to say there.
6114000	6116000	S2100Matt says
6116000	6118000	we hear you but relax.
6118000	6120000	It's not like we're going to stop making Pokemon games
6120000	6122000	where you can still use those.
6122000	6124000	Act Def says I said it before and I'll say
6124000	6126000	it again. Yeah it sucks that not all
6126000	6128000	the Pokemon won't appear in the newest games.
6128000	6130000	But holy fuck are people over
6130000	6132000	reacting to this.
6132000	6134000	Well you know internet gonna internet.
6134000	6136000	And I think there are some
6136000	6138000	people overreacting. In fact I would even say there's a lot
6138000	6140000	of people overreacting. But
6140000	6142000	you know especially when you hear stories about the whole
6142000	6144000	like they built up their collection from
6144000	6146000	childhood. They had
6146000	6148000	trades from friends they haven't seen.
6148000	6150000	And like how important the
6150000	6152000	collection is to some people.
6152000	6154000	I get why people are left with a
6154000	6156000	profound sense of
6156000	6158000	sadness and disappointment.
6158000	6160000	That part I get.
6160000	6162000	The Twitter campaigns and that stuff
6162000	6164000	and change.org and stuff
6164000	6166000	I just you know but
6166000	6168000	at the same time if people weren't doing
6168000	6170000	that would it have prompted this letter.
6170000	6172000	Is now the Pokemon
6172000	6174000	company maybe thinking about this for the next
6174000	6176000	thing they do. So while
6176000	6178000	I don't I mean they're not going to fix it for Sword and
6178000	6180000	Shield. We all knew they could. How could they
6180000	6182000	possibly. The game's got to be wrapping up
6182000	6184000	development. It's got to go gold by
6184000	6186000	probably the end of summer early early early
6186000	6188000	fall so it can get out in time.
6188000	6190000	But you know maybe again if they decide
6190000	6192000	to do a Pokemon gun
6192000	6194000	I keep joking about that. What would it be. Maybe
6194000	6196000	Pokemon arrow. I don't know.
6196000	6198000	If a third thing in
6198000	6200000	Pokemon Knight with a K. I don't know.
6200000	6202000	So if they end up doing a third
6202000	6204000	Pokemon in the series perhaps
6204000	6206000	that will be the one that has all the Pokemon in it.
6206000	6208000	But now I kind of feel
6208000	6210000	like through this letter at least maybe like
6210000	6212000	they're saying OK we
6212000	6214000	heard you. They're not going to come out and say
6214000	6216000	we made a mistake. Please. They're
6216000	6218000	going to say I think they're going to say
6218000	6220000	the next time we do this
6220000	6222000	we're going to not
6222000	6224000	do the same thing. At least
6224000	6226000	I kind of hope as
6226000	6228000	a Pokemon fan myself. That's what I'm hearing.
6228000	6230000	So while they are also
6230000	6232000	brings up it's hard enough to balance a game with matchups
6232000	6234000	for over 500 characters. They probably got
6234000	6236000	tired of having to balance so many
6236000	6238000	character matchups. So
6238000	6240000	and then a lot of just
6240000	6242000	comments in our chat.
6242000	6244000	DJ Rama S says Pokemon Belt
6244000	6246000	Sia Tabiri. Pokemon
6246000	6248000	Trebuchet.
6248000	6250000	Metal Mayhem. Pokemon Tactical Nuke.
6250000	6252000	Dark Tetsuya. Pokemon Helmet.
6252000	6254000	All right guys calm down.
6254000	6256000	So anyway we'll see what develops.
6256000	6258000	I think in the
6258000	6260000	long term I think people
6260000	6262000	were kind of heard but gamers
6262000	6264000	would rather hear now. They want
6264000	6266000	to hear like oh there's going to be a patch that will
6266000	6268000	fix all this. I just
6268000	6270000	I don't think that's going to happen.
6270000	6272000	If it does long term damage to the
6272000	6274000	franchise or not that's what we'll see.
6274000	6276000	That's going to be the real question
6276000	6278000	and that's what I'm really dying
6278000	6280000	to know the answer to. How
6280000	6282000	is this going to impact sales at the end of the day?
6282000	6284000	Because I bet there's a lot of
6284000	6286000	people that are still going to buy the game because it's Pokemon even though
6286000	6288000	they're pissed off. Yeah. I haven't really
6288000	6290000	picked up a mainline Pokemon game
6290000	6292000	like that. I've only done like
6292000	6294000	you know let's go.
6294000	6296000	I'll probably pick it up
6296000	6298000	just because a new Pokemon
6298000	6300000	Switch game like hell yeah I want to check it out.
6300000	6302000	Like a new mainline game that's on a TV
6302000	6304000	and portable console like for that alone
6304000	6306000	I'm getting excited and some of the things they're doing.
6306000	6308000	Doesn't mean I think they made the right decision
6308000	6310000	but you know
6310000	6312000	I still kind of want to check out what's there.
6312000	6314000	So we'll see. Anyway.
6314000	6316000	SSG 100
6316000	6318000	Matt with a throwback here.
6318000	6320000	Okay like two of you are going to get this joke.
6320000	6322000	Pokemon peppermint time and mint.
6324000	6326000	There's a great old joke in there.
6326000	6328000	I'll leave it at that. Alright anyway.
6328000	6330000	Moving on.
6330000	6332000	Loki what do you have for us? Alright
6332000	6334000	so this is kind of cool. So whereas
6334000	6336000	we may have all these different
6338000	6340000	platforms out there where we can purchase
6340000	6342000	our games and kind of separating our libraries
6342000	6344000	around. Good old games
6344000	6346000	is trying to actually unite
6346000	6348000	all of that together with GOG
6348000	6350000	Galaxy 2.0.
6350000	6352000	So GOG Galaxy 2.0 is in closed
6352000	6354000	beta.
6354000	6356000	But apparently their version of their client
6356000	6358000	allows you to
6358000	6360000	integrate
6360000	6362000	other communities together.
6362000	6364000	So for example right now
6364000	6366000	GOG and Xbox Live are
6366000	6368000	integrated but they're saying that Battle.net
6368000	6370000	Epic, Origin, Playstation
6370000	6372000	Network, Steam and Uplay
6372000	6374000	are going to be available as
6374000	6376000	community created
6376000	6378000	integrations. And they said
6378000	6380000	however these integrations
6380000	6382000	function similarly
6382000	6384000	allowing you to import games
6384000	6386000	and depending on the platform
6386000	6388000	achievements and other stuff.
6388000	6390000	So they'll be able to have all of your
6390000	6392000	game libraries together
6392000	6394000	in one thing. I don't know
6394000	6396000	if that means also being able to launch games
6396000	6398000	from other platforms. Hopefully.
6398000	6400000	So
6400000	6402000	that would be cool if it was all in one place.
6402000	6404000	I'm curious
6404000	6406000	to check this out. It's in beta right now.
6408000	6410000	Yo dog we heard you like launchers.
6410000	6412000	So cross platform
6412000	6414000	chat
6414000	6416000	and one friends list.
6416000	6418000	It's an interesting
6418000	6420000	way for GOG to
6420000	6422000	differentiate themselves
6422000	6424000	from the competition by
6424000	6426000	trying to be the good guy
6426000	6428000	if you will. It's kind of
6428000	6430000	interesting. The good old guy.
6430000	6432000	That's what
6432000	6434000	they're trying to do with this. It's your buddy.
6434000	6436000	It's your buddy. Hey it's me
6436000	6438000	it's GOG. You know how like your
6438000	6440000	epic store and your steam and
6440000	6442000	your battle net and Uplay
6442000	6444000	and all that shit can't all get along.
6444000	6446000	Well I'm here to help you get your shit sorted out.
6446000	6448000	So I don't know. It sounds also
6448000	6450000	to me very similar to like is it Apple
6450000	6452000	TV. Oh no Playstation has
6452000	6454000	this. Where if you go into like the
6454000	6456000	TV movie thing on Playstation you
6456000	6458000	can see like what movies are on what
6458000	6460000	service. You know what I mean.
6460000	6462000	That's kind of an interesting sort of
6462000	6464000	approach to it.
6464000	6466000	So and to be to be
6466000	6468000	fair I haven't really used the GOG launcher
6468000	6470000	in a while but this is something where
6470000	6472000	I might go oh I'd be kind of curious to
6472000	6474000	check this out. We'll see. So
6474000	6476000	SSG100
6476000	6478000	Matt points out yeah GOG needs
6478000	6480000	to work on being the good guy. Yeah
6480000	6482000	because we know they've had some choice things
6482000	6484000	with their social media. So yeah
6484000	6486000	maybe this is a chance for them
6486000	6488000	to rehab their image a little.
6488000	6490000	Questbuster in chat says Microsoft's
6490000	6492000	officially on board already. Well that's
6492000	6494000	good news. That's always good when like the
6494000	6496000	companies are like yeah we support this. And I'm
6496000	6498000	sure from Microsoft's perspective they're like
6498000	6500000	yeah another place for people to sign up for
6500000	6502000	Game Pass. Hell yeah.
6502000	6504000	So why not.
6504000	6506000	I'm into it. I think it's a
6506000	6508000	clever idea. So we'll see what happens. I mean yeah I do
6508000	6510000	I have that Epic launcher.
6510000	6512000	I have Steam. I have
6512000	6514000	Battle.net that all are on my
6514000	6516000	computer and I use pretty regularly.
6516000	6518000	So I'm into the
6518000	6520000	idea of something to bring them all together.
6520000	6522000	It would be nice to be able to do that.
6522000	6524000	Yeah. I'd like that with my VR library
6524000	6526000	too. It would be nice.
6526000	6528000	Darticuia does want to point out they've addressed the social
6528000	6530000	media stuff that guy's gone as far as I know.
6530000	6532000	OK. All right.
6532000	6534000	Anyway let's
6534000	6536000	move on and talk about
6536000	6538000	Google Stadia. You know
6538000	6540000	because Google Stadia are going to be
6540000	6542000	games that essentially exist in the clouds.
6542000	6544000	You're not going to be picking them up physically at all.
6544000	6546000	Some people were wondering well will that
6546000	6548000	be kind of reflected in the price. And the answer
6548000	6550000	is no.
6550000	6552000	So Google has clarified that
6552000	6554000	games that are sold on Stadia will
6554000	6556000	probably not be cheaper than they are
6556000	6558000	on PlayStation 4 or Xbox
6558000	6560000	One.
6560000	6562000	So if you choose to buy games
6562000	6564000	on Stadia you're probably going to be
6564000	6566000	paying the 60 bucks or a comparable
6566000	6568000	price to what you would pay on consoles. You know some games
6568000	6570000	are 20 or 30 bucks just depending on what the game is.
6570000	6572000	Phil Harrison in an interview
6572000	6574000	with Eurogamer said quote
6574000	6576000	I don't know why it would be cheaper.
6576000	6578000	In the interview Harrison
6578000	6580000	talks about that you have access
6580000	6582000	to your purchase games on any screen that
6582000	6584000	you own and therefore you have
6584000	6586000	kind of maximum fidelity with that.
6586000	6588000	So it's like you don't just have this one system that your
6588000	6590000	game works on. You can use this game
6590000	6592000	that you bought on your tablet on your phone
6592000	6594000	on your PC right. So that's
6594000	6596000	kind of the angle he's trying to sell it with which
6596000	6598000	OK sure that's what Stadia is going to do.
6598000	6600000	But yeah
6600000	6602000	for that reason they do not see the prices
6602000	6604000	on Stadia being cheaper.
6604000	6606000	Also saying
6606000	6608000	the publisher or the developer is in as
6608000	6610000	much control of the prices as we are
6610000	6612000	so it's a bit difficult for me to say what the prices
6612000	6614000	will be right now. But we're obviously
6614000	6616000	going to be very aware of prevailing
6616000	6618000	prices in the marketplace.
6618000	6620000	So as a reminder Google Stadia Pro
6620000	6622000	launches on November
6622000	6624000	19th and that's the one you have to pay a little
6624000	6626000	money for the free version not
6626000	6628000	anticipated until next
6628000	6630000	year. So yeah
6630000	6632000	there's a lot of comments in our chat
6632000	6634000	not so nice about this
6634000	6636000	Dejirama S says Google Stadia whack
6636000	6638000	Cajudo says rent games
6638000	6640000	for full price. Dr. Suya says
6640000	6642000	yeah the more I hear about Stadia the more I'm thinking
6642000	6644000	I'll just stick with my PC.
6644000	6646000	Orange Right says pay for the privilege of remotely
6646000	6648000	playing it. So
6648000	6650000	I don't know. I hope Stadia is kind of
6650000	6652000	listening to some of the feedback they're getting out there and plans
6652000	6654000	to address it. But this could be a little bit like
6654000	6656000	this could be dicey for them.
6656000	6658000	I don't know.
6658000	6660000	Well they also made the comment too how they
6660000	6662000	were talking about the
6662000	6664000	bandwidth caps. So people had
6664000	6666000	concerns about bandwidth caps and
6666000	6668000	that's not going to be something that's going to
6668000	6670000	work well with these games and
6670000	6672000	their response was what are you talking
6672000	6674000	about. This is the cable industry
6674000	6676000	we're talking about. They'll adapt. They'll
6676000	6678000	loosen up bandwidth caps if
6678000	6680000	people want Stadia
6680000	6682000	and I'm like are you fucking stupid
6682000	6684000	do you exist in this reality. Well
6684000	6686000	I kind of I don't want to
6686000	6688000	say I agree 100 percent. I agree
6688000	6690000	with the direction
6690000	6692000	but that like the market
6692000	6694000	will hoot and holler
6694000	6696000	and force cable companies to upgrade
6696000	6698000	as the demand for more stuff comes in.
6698000	6700000	But hold on let me finish. It's not
6700000	6702000	going to happen next year. That's my point.
6702000	6704000	Yeah. So the thing is is that
6704000	6706000	Google needs to be prepared
6706000	6708000	and I think for Stadia
6708000	6710000	to succeed if they want Stadia to succeed
6710000	6712000	Google needs to really be prepared
6712000	6714000	to really hang on to this
6714000	6716000	for five
6716000	6718000	ten years.
6718000	6720000	I'm serious like
6720000	6722000	because Google Stadia I don't see catching
6722000	6724000	fire next year. But if Google
6724000	6726000	is willing to stand by Stadia
6726000	6728000	for five years ten years
6728000	6730000	play the long game with this
6730000	6732000	they might find success with it. They just
6732000	6734000	well might because that will give enough time
6734000	6736000	for the cable industry to catch up
6736000	6738000	because that's when the 4K
6738000	6740000	Netflix that's when that's going to get
6740000	6742000	bigger and more and more people are streaming
6742000	6744000	and that's really what's going to
6744000	6746000	force the cable industry to look into upgrading
6746000	6748000	and so forth.
6748000	6750000	But if Google is going to just walk away
6750000	6752000	from it if it flops in a year
6752000	6754000	like Buzz
6754000	6756000	or Google Plus or something like that
6756000	6758000	then that's concerning. So what
6758000	6760000	I would really like to hear
6760000	6762000	is Google say we are committed
6762000	6764000	to this for ten
6764000	6766000	years. And I know
6766000	6768000	that's a weird thing to ask a company to say
6768000	6770000	but when you're Google I don't know if that is
6770000	6772000	too crazy to ask. Especially with their track
6772000	6774000	record. Yeah. Yeah. And folks in
6774000	6776000	chat some folks kind of agreeing with me here
6776000	6778000	saying Google will have to play
6778000	6780000	the long game which they don't always do well
6780000	6782000	and active says spoilers they won't.
6782000	6784000	So yeah not people not
6784000	6786000	feeling too big on that especially
6786000	6788000	after the news about Hangouts
6788000	6790000	last last week or two weeks ago
6790000	6792000	that Google Hangouts is sunsetting. That's
6792000	6794000	that's a big fucking deal especially for
6794000	6796000	podcasters. Yeah. So
6796000	6798000	I would
6798000	6800000	recommend if you are somebody that's in the Hangouts
6800000	6802000	there are alternatives out there. I mean I guess
6802000	6804000	Skype is something that's available and I'm sure
6804000	6806000	Microsoft would love to eat this up. So hopefully
6806000	6808000	you know they're they're looking into
6808000	6810000	things. Zoom meetings
6810000	6812000	I know is a way a lot of people do like video and
6812000	6814000	talk to each other. But I think you have to pay for
6814000	6816000	advance meetings on that.
6816000	6818000	So there are alternatives out there. So if
6818000	6820000	you are somebody that's relied on Google Hangouts
6820000	6822000	start start exploring what some of your backups
6822000	6824000	are. So anyway
6824000	6826000	interesting while I are in
6826000	6828000	chat says Microsoft is actually
6828000	6830000	removing the e-book store
6830000	6832000	and the e-book reading feature from
6832000	6834000	Microsoft Edge. And in exchange
6834000	6836000	they're refunding the full purchase
6836000	6838000	prices of all of the books you bought
6838000	6840000	to your Microsoft account. Would Google
6840000	6842000	do this.
6842000	6844000	So no the answer is
6844000	6846000	clearly no. So now what happens
6846000	6848000	if Stadia goes under in a year you're going to get
6848000	6850000	refunded for your games.
6850000	6852000	Anyway that's that's the risk
6852000	6854000	of buying digitally. Yeah
6854000	6856000	and I just I just don't know if
6856000	6858000	enough people are ready for it. I don't
6858000	6860000	know I don't want to keep being negative on Stadia
6860000	6862000	but it's just I just
6862000	6864000	I think it's too right. It's too
6864000	6866000	early. But maybe that's why pros coming out
6866000	6868000	first let the people who really really want it
6868000	6870000	and then let's see what exclusive
6870000	6872000	games that they have that are must have
6872000	6874000	you must that or whatever
6874000	6876000	that too. All right. Moving on a few more
6876000	6878000	stories that we're going to open up discord
6878000	6880000	if you want to give us a call

6900000	6902000	you can always ask stuff in our chat room as well
6902000	6904000	and I will try my best to get to it.
6904000	6906000	If it scrolls off screen
6906000	6908000	make sure I'm able
6908000	6910000	to get to that later. Remind me.
6910000	6912000	But a few stories first before we get to that.
6912000	6914000	So I've been keeping my eye
6914000	6916000	on the LEGO Overwatch
6916000	6918000	sets. I haven't purchased any
6918000	6920000	I thought about it
6920000	6922000	but you know they're expensive
6922000	6924000	and it's hard to justify
6924000	6926000	buying sets but I don't know
6926000	6928000	these new ones are pretty cool so they've got
6928000	6930000	two new sets that are coming out in October
6930000	6932000	so one of them is going to be
6932000	6934000	for Hammond in
6934000	6936000	Wrecking Ball. Basically
6936000	6938000	that looks fucking awesome.
6938000	6940000	That one's only twenty bucks.
6940000	6942000	I probably will pick that one up for
6942000	6944000	twenty dollars. That seems really worth it for that.
6944000	6946000	The other set that's coming out though
6946000	6948000	is fifty dollars
6948000	6950000	and it is both
6950000	6952000	Junkrat and
6952000	6954000	Roadhog
6954000	6956000	and they have this giant
6956000	6958000	motorcycle thing.
6958000	6960000	That looks alright.
6960000	6962000	I'm surprised though that that's so much more
6962000	6964000	expensive just for
6964000	6966000	what that is. Because of all the parts maybe
6966000	6968000	that make up that big Katamari looking thing.
6968000	6970000	It's three hundred and eighty parts
6970000	6972000	versus the
6972000	6974000	Wrecking Ball one which is
6974000	6976000	two hundred and twenty seven. Those are relatively small sets
6976000	6978000	but like three hundred and eighty for
6978000	6980000	fifty dollars
6980000	6982000	is so expensive. That Wrecking Ball one
6982000	6984000	is super fucking cute though. It is. I will have
6984000	6986000	to probably pick that up. That's like the perfect
6986000	6988000	like little like desk
6988000	6990000	thing. That's where I put them. Yeah.
6990000	6992000	The place I used to
6992000	6994000	get some of my
6994000	6996000	knock off sets. They
6996000	6998000	have these custom
6998000	7000000	brick heads of all the
7000000	7002000	Overwatch characters. And so
7002000	7004000	I'm thinking about getting those instead of the
7004000	7006000	Overwatch sets but
7006000	7008000	I do want that Wrecking Ball set
7008000	7010000	that looks pretty awesome. Yeah.
7010000	7012000	Maybe not. Maybe the Roadhog one but
7012000	7014000	definitely the Wrecking Ball one.
7014000	7016000	Yeah.
7016000	7018000	It took me four hours to build
7018000	7020000	Red Heart and Diva together. So yeah it's a good
7020000	7022000	it's a good project. Right.
7022000	7024000	Yeah. That one was also another
7024000	7026000	I almost got that one too. That was the one I was
7026000	7028000	kind of interested in but
7028000	7030000	we'll see.
7030000	7032000	Alright. Well moving on
7032000	7034000	for our last story tonight which you know
7034000	7036000	I know is a big part of many of your weeks
7036000	7038000	because a lot of Twitch watchers
7038000	7040000	and a lot of like gamers out there love to watch
7040000	7042000	some summer games done quick.
7042000	7044000	And of course the whole thing I mean it is about
7044000	7046000	speed running games but it is done for
7046000	7048000	charity. And it should be
7048000	7050000	pointed out and this is really awesome is
7050000	7052000	that summer games done quick
7052000	7054000	shattered fundraising this year.
7054000	7056000	They for the first time passed
7056000	7058000	the three million dollar mark.
7058000	7060000	And the charity that
7060000	7062000	they raised money for this year was Doctors
7062000	7064000	Without Borders. That is more
7064000	7066000	than 900,000 in the
7066000	7068000	previous year. So that's amazing.
7068000	7070000	That's amazing. If you were actually
7070000	7072000	there in Minneapolis Minnesota about
7072000	7074000	2,600 people were there in person
7074000	7076000	and they say the peak of the Twitch streams
7076000	7078000	was 156,000
7078000	7080000	viewers. So that's
7080000	7082000	that's great. Congratulations
7082000	7084000	to everybody involved with the
7084000	7086000	games done quick. If you want to watch
7086000	7088000	archives is available on the YouTube of course
7088000	7090000	and the final
7090000	7092000	final I'm using my quoting numbers as of
7092000	7094000	the time of this report was three
7094000	7096000	three million five thousand
7096000	7098000	two hundred twenty eight dollars. But I believe the donations
7098000	7100000	still kind of you can still donate for a little
7100000	7102000	while afterwards. I mean hello it's charity
7102000	7104000	fundraising. They're going to let you do that for a good long time.
7104000	7106000	Anyway there will be
7106000	7108000	there will be a games done quick
7108000	7110000	express in September
7110000	7112000	at Twitch Con. The next
7112000	7114000	big show though is going to be Awesome
7114000	7116000	Done Quick 2020 in January
7116000	7118000	and that is going to be the 10 year
7118000	7120000	anniversary of
7120000	7122000	the show.
7122000	7124000	That's very exciting. I really like watching
7124000	7126000	these each year and I love catching up on
7126000	7128000	everything on YouTube.
7128000	7130000	Just because I'm not able to obviously
7130000	7132000	in 24 hours a day
7132000	7134000	to catch all these things.
7134000	7136000	I watched was it the Zelda randomizer
7136000	7138000	earlier this week. I was
7138000	7140000	watching the Taskbot stuff earlier
7140000	7142000	today the Mario Kart Wii.
7142000	7144000	I watched parts the last
7144000	7146000	but I didn't have enough time to get through like all of that
7146000	7148000	and
7148000	7150000	just yeah a lot of
7150000	7152000	a lot of that stuff is just really interesting to watch
7152000	7154000	the runs of those and so
7154000	7156000	I wish they would do it more often than twice a year
7156000	7158000	but I understand organizing. It makes it a little
7158000	7160000	more special when they do it twice a year.
7160000	7162000	And you know if you want to see speed runs people are
7162000	7164000	speed running stuff on Twitch all of the time.
7164000	7166000	And AG
7166000	7168000	I want to say Games Done Quick does other things
7168000	7170000	throughout the year. They have
7170000	7172000	mini races and stuff like that
7172000	7174000	that they'll do on those channels.
7174000	7176000	So there's stuff out there
7176000	7178000	that kind of
7178000	7180000	in between all of that but
7180000	7182000	I do like those events and
7182000	7184000	it is sad that it's only twice a year
7184000	7186000	but I understand why.
7186000	7188000	At least they're doing these mini things too
7188000	7190000	between TwitchCon and all that stuff as well.
7190000	7192000	Anyway we are going
7192000	7194000	to go to our Discord
7194000	7196000	server and start to take some calls
7196000	7198000	in our listener roundtable and if you have questions in our chat
7198000	7200000	room you can certainly do that as well over at
7200000	7202000	twitch.tv slash vog network.
7202000	7204000	I know we have somebody already on the line. I have a
7204000	7206000	feeling this might tie into our last story so let's go to the
7206000	7208000	phone. Hi you are on Orange Launch Radio
7208000	7210000	who's this?
7212000	7214000	Hello you are on Orange Launch Radio who's
7214000	7216000	this? Uh oh I think
7216000	7218000	did I drag and drop them into the wrong? Let's try that again.
7218000	7220000	Hi you are on Orange Launch Radio who's this?
7222000	7224000	If you can hear me you are currently
7224000	7226000	muted. I see the mute icon.
7226000	7228000	So you might want to unmute.
7228000	7230000	Yay I figured it out.
7230000	7232000	You got it. It is
7232000	7234000	our voice over man Jason
7234000	7236000	who is
7236000	7238000	Well on most weeks anyways. Yeah not tonight.
7238000	7240000	I had the good old generic intro because even I
7240000	7242000	was so freaking busy. We've all had busy weeks.
7242000	7244000	But how are you my friend?
7244000	7246000	You were at you were one of those
7246000	7248000	2,600 people at SGDQ right?
7248000	7250000	I was one of those
7250000	7252000	2,600 people at GDQ.
7252000	7254000	I was one of those oh geez
7254000	7256000	what was it 70 names in the credits
7256000	7258000	at the very end of the show? Oh
7258000	7260000	cool. I didn't I didn't realize they did
7260000	7262000	they did the credits at the I wasn't able to watch
7262000	7264000	the end of it so just because
7264000	7266000	because I've been LARPing I haven't been
7266000	7268000	able to really watch any of the streams
7268000	7270000	I'll have to go back and do it on YouTube so
7270000	7272000	Yeah they if you
7272000	7274000	I assume you can go back and I don't
7274000	7276000	know if they'll put it on YouTube
7276000	7278000	if they'll just kind of like attach it to the
7278000	7280000	Kruger run but certainly if you go
7280000	7282000	back and watch the past broadcast
7282000	7284000	of the very end of the Twitch stream
7284000	7286000	they had a little
7286000	7288000	sizzle reel for the
7288000	7290000	for the end of the show talking about
7290000	7292000	what it is what they did and
7292000	7294000	then they had a credit sequence of
7294000	7296000	all of the staff and all of the volunteers
7296000	7298000	for the occasion as well.
7298000	7300000	Well so I'm dying to know
7300000	7302000	how was your first experience
7302000	7304000	there because you know it said
7304000	7306000	156,000 were watching
7306000	7308000	at the peak on Twitch but only
7308000	7310000	2,600 are there
7310000	7312000	in person obviously this is a big
7312000	7314000	you know fundraiser across
7314000	7316000	you know virtual channels and television
7316000	7318000	stuff but I imagine the experience of being
7318000	7320000	there is something very few
7320000	7322000	of the viewers have experienced so I'm kind
7322000	7324000	of curious what did you think seeing it from this
7324000	7326000	side this time? Yeah
7326000	7328000	and a lot of people
7328000	7330000	sis as a recurring theme you
7330000	7332000	go to any other prominent
7332000	7334000	convention any anime convention
7334000	7336000	any gaming convention
7336000	7338000	on the tier of TwitchCon
7338000	7340000	on the tier of even like
7340000	7342000	the ComicCon series
7342000	7344000	or the PopCultureCon series
7344000	7346000	as Denver recently renamed to
7346000	7348000	you go to any other convention that is
7348000	7350000	intended to pull
7350000	7352000	big crowds to pull big
7352000	7354000	names to pull bigger crowds
7354000	7356000	to pull bigger names
7356000	7358000	and you have this critical mass
7358000	7360000	of everything in fun culture
7360000	7362000	where because this is a
7362000	7364000	deliberately limited
7364000	7366000	event in physical
7366000	7368000	participation
7368000	7370000	yeah it's at a very
7370000	7372000	very reasonable number and then
7372000	7374000	you take that 2,600
7374000	7376000	you slice it up between people
7376000	7378000	that aren't there for the whole week
7378000	7380000	people that go there for friends
7380000	7382000	the sheer number of like
7382000	7384000	24 hour event people that are more night
7384000	7386000	owls people that are more morning people that are
7386000	7388000	more daytime and you have
7388000	7390000	this really comfortable
7390000	7392000	spread where
7392000	7394000	even though it only takes place on the
7394000	7396000	single floor of a hotel it
7396000	7398000	still like
7398000	7400000	flows smoothly enough
7400000	7402000	because of the deliberate
7402000	7404000	limiting
7404000	7406000	and I should point out Jason
7406000	7408000	is on the road right now so his
7408000	7410000	audio may drop a little bit in and out
7410000	7412000	as it's doing right now Jason sorry I
7412000	7414000	don't know if the connection is stabilizing there can you hear us
7414000	7416000	yeah I can hear you just fine
7416000	7418000	you're just cutting in where are
7418000	7420000	you right now on the road
7420000	7422000	I am currently in Nebraska
7422000	7424000	ok well
7424000	7426000	the Nebraska internet is
7426000	7428000	a little wonky but that's alright
7428000	7430000	so yeah
7430000	7432000	that's an interesting point is that that number is really
7432000	7434000	kind of spread out because it's such a long
7434000	7436000	convention and so forth by the
7436000	7438000	way you're getting a lot of love in our chat room
7438000	7440000	for folks saying Jason has the
7440000	7442000	SJ100 Matt says Jason has the voice
7442000	7444000	to be a donation announcer not
7444000	7446000	sure why they didn't catch that
7446000	7448000	and then let's see Questbuster
7448000	7450000	says seriously he'd be great as an announcer
7450000	7452000	hashtag future
7452000	7454000	goals so
7454000	7456000	it's a funny funny story like
7456000	7458000	when you when you sign
7458000	7460000	up to be a volunteer
7460000	7462000	you what
7462000	7464000	they what they actually did first time this year
7464000	7466000	and specifically for SGDQ
7466000	7468000	was people applying to
7468000	7470000	be a host actually did a little
7470000	7472000	audition they got
7472000	7474000	Zenny I forgot
7474000	7476000	his whole username but they got a
7476000	7478000	Super Metroid runner to make a generic
7478000	7480000	five minute video and then
7480000	7482000	they gave a bunch of kind of
7482000	7484000	sample sample
7484000	7486000	donations to see if you can spot
7486000	7488000	to gauge
7488000	7490000	your ability to read comfortably
7490000	7492000	but also to make sure that you're not just
7492000	7494000	going to blurt out there was actually one
7494000	7496000	suggested donation comment
7496000	7498000	that said
7498000	7500000	acted like it was talking about a
7500000	7502000	character in the metro universe but was
7502000	7504000	actually making a racist reference
7504000	7506000	so even though donation
7506000	7508000	screening is a thing is another
7508000	7510000	role they also want to make sure that
7510000	7512000	hosts are reasonable with content
7512000	7514000	and checking and
7514000	7516000	and apply you know that much
7516000	7518000	to the universe and they're not just
7518000	7520000	literally reading off a script because the
7520000	7522000	point of the host is is to is to
7522000	7524000	host is to is to be the voice
7524000	7526000	I apply and
7526000	7528000	to be a host I was just outside the
7528000	7530000	bubble and I think one of the
7530000	7532000	biggest reasons why I got a little bit of feedback
7532000	7534000	that was a little weirdly mixed
7534000	7536000	but one of the things that was a
7536000	7538000	silly idea in
7538000	7540000	in hindsight of my own decision was
7540000	7542000	that I called it super
7542000	7544000	games done quick which has not
7544000	7546000	been the name for a good couple of years
7546000	7548000	and I was kind of
7548000	7550000	it was kind of a you know on the nose
7550000	7552000	flashing my OG
7552000	7554000	status or some crap like
7554000	7556000	that despite the fact that this was the first time I
7556000	7558000	attended but that was a
7558000	7560000	detriment because I'm running the show
7560000	7562000	and as the host you
7562000	7564000	have to push the details
7564000	7566000	admittedly when you're on the show you have a
7566000	7568000	producer in your ear you're dealing with the crowd
7568000	7570000	the hosts banter with
7570000	7572000	the runner and those sorts of things like
7572000	7574000	you're getting all this feedback but it's
7574000	7576000	still important that you're in the
7576000	7578000	culture to begin with
7578000	7580000	I met
7580000	7582000	a sporadic erratic
7582000	7584000	that did the
7584000	7586000	chrono trigger that was the host for that
7586000	7588000	final run I met her at that orientation
7588000	7590000	and then bantered with her
7590000	7592000	throughout the week and then talked to her after
7592000	7594000	after it was all said and done
7594000	7596000	and she got that shift
7596000	7598000	because she was very much
7598000	7600000	in with those
7600000	7602000	runners and considering
7602000	7604000	that she sang Gato's
7604000	7606000	song or Gonzalez's
7606000	7608000	song as it was
7608000	7610000	in Japanese like
7610000	7612000	that's a distinct
7612000	7614000	quality that just
7614000	7616000	fucking shined for her that was
7616000	7618000	truly incredible and you get
7618000	7620000	that with like the
7620000	7622000	I don't remember the host
7622000	7624000	for the
7624000	7626000	Super Metroid Zelda combo
7626000	7628000	combo co-op but like
7628000	7630000	that's the strength of
7630000	7632000	submitting to be a host is not
7632000	7634000	just your capability to do that production
7634000	7636000	but also to
7636000	7638000	had to be in a community
7638000	7640000	and to be able to be
7640000	7642000	part of the presentation be part
7642000	7644000	of the show as it's being done
7644000	7646000	where possible with the runner get
7646000	7648000	accepted to the show and everything else like that so
7648000	7650000	I did apply to be a host I did not get
7650000	7652000	accepted as many people no doubt
7652000	7654000	saw I got my
7654000	7656000	second choice which was enforcement which was
7656000	7658000	bag checking just
7658000	7660000	waiting food from the floor I
7660000	7662000	did a bunch of cleanup of the stream
7662000	7664000	multiple times picking up latent cups
7664000	7666000	and all that kind of all that kind of nonsense
7666000	7668000	I
7668000	7670000	got relatively easy shifts as well
7670000	7672000	they were all 8 a.m. to noon
7672000	7674000	based off the
7674000	7676000	based off the discussion that was happening
7676000	7678000	in the in the volunteers channel
7678000	7680000	things were a little dicey
7680000	7682000	earlier in the night because you get the
7682000	7684000	2 a.m. 3 a.m. drunkie
7684000	7686000	shenanigans and then just kind of
7686000	7688000	the more critical mass
7688000	7690000	in the afternoon hours and those
7690000	7692000	sorts of things my job was
7692000	7694000	relatively easy all things concerned
7694000	7696000	but the entirety of being
7696000	7698000	a volunteer with GDQ was a great
7698000	7700000	experience not
7700000	7702000	only not only because this
7702000	7704000	was my first time attending
7704000	7706000	and I also got to be part of the production
7706000	7708000	but also just to be able to see
7708000	7710000	what's happening on a technical level
7710000	7712000	interact with the staff meet the staff
7712000	7714000	everything that they put into it
7714000	7716000	on a technical level both in
7716000	7718000	discord generally where volunteers
7718000	7720000	chat in slack specifically
7720000	7722000	because that gives us enforcement
7722000	7724000	a little bit more granular
7724000	7726000	discussion to be able to shout out a staff
7726000	7728000	member if we need additional
7728000	7730000	intervention and those sorts of things
7730000	7732000	and then
7732000	7734000	everything that goes on on the stage
7734000	7736000	being able to banter being able
7736000	7738000	to meet and talk to the people on
7738000	7740000	the other on the other occasions
7740000	7742000	there there was some discussion
7742000	7744000	about more
7744000	7746000	significantly known personalities
7746000	7748000	in other roles that enforcement
7748000	7750000	kind of had to come in and
7750000	7752000	come in
7752000	7754000	serve their purpose serve their role to
7754000	7756000	dissuade to dissuade
7756000	7758000	the nonsense that does
7758000	7760000	happen just not in large
7760000	7762000	numbers again because of the limited
7762000	7764000	nature of the events
7764000	7766000	but it's like it's it is a
7766000	7768000	I
7768000	7770000	love the fact that
7770000	7772000	it is infrequent
7772000	7774000	as it is with the most
7774000	7776000	notable events being
7776000	7778000	AGDQ GDQ and GDQ express
7778000	7780000	but
7780000	7782000	also to their benefit they're also
7782000	7784000	doing things like frame fatales
7784000	7786000	that they did back in May
7786000	7788000	hot fixes both interviews and
7788000	7790000	runs and special sorts of things
7790000	7792000	to kind of keep
7792000	7794000	a modicum of
7794000	7796000	interest in between these sorts of events
7796000	7798000	but this is truly
7798000	7800000	becoming
7800000	7802000	they're they're stepping up content
7802000	7804000	where possible and always
7804000	7806000	continuing to be done
7806000	7808000	for good causes which
7808000	7810000	as long as that's the number one
7810000	7812000	goal and drives
7812000	7814000	their drives
7814000	7816000	what they are capable of doing
7816000	7818000	they're going to
7818000	7820000	you know produce just enough content to
7820000	7822000	be relevant and continue to do it for
7822000	7824000	for spectacular reasons
7824000	7826000	you know it's and the
7826000	7828000	game's done quick brand is really kind of like
7828000	7830000	set the bar in a lot of categories
7830000	7832000	kind of like you know like like you know and continue
7832000	7834000	to raise that bar in you know not just like
7834000	7836000	what what is a good
7836000	7838000	speed running stream kind of look like
7838000	7840000	what does good commentating on a speed running
7840000	7842000	stream look like but just the ends of how do
7842000	7844000	you how do you run an effective charity stream
7844000	7846000	I mean especially the amount
7846000	7848000	that they they raised
7848000	7850000	I mean it's just a huge testament
7850000	7852000	to this formula that they've refined
7852000	7854000	over there coming up on 10 year existence
7854000	7856000	that I think just really speaks to
7856000	7858000	you know the hard work that all these volunteers are putting in
7858000	7860000	year round even if we're lamenting that
7860000	7862000	you know it only happens twice a year it
7862000	7864000	sounds like that you know production yeah they're working
7864000	7866000	to year round to really make it a type
7866000	7868000	of production some
7868000	7870000	pick up comments in our chat here quest buster says
7870000	7872000	Jason's leveled up his diplomacy skill
7872000	7874000	at SGDQ and
7874000	7876000	as soon as Matt says they also did a
7876000	7878000	few pickup streams for to benefit
7878000	7880000	disasters which is also great oh that's
7880000	7882000	that's definitely true yeah that's
7882000	7884000	right the the Hurricane Maria
7884000	7886000	stuff it was that earlier
7886000	7888000	jeez I don't even remember when that happened but yeah I
7888000	7890000	completely forgot about the
7890000	7892000	both the Houston flooding last
7892000	7894000	year as well as Hurricane Mary
7894000	7896000	and those sorts of disaster
7896000	7898000	really yeah I had I completely
7898000	7900000	forgotten about those without that being
7900000	7902000	mentioned they're being brought up
7902000	7904000	Jason let me ask you this since it was
7904000	7906000	a year that really raised the bar in many
7906000	7908000	ways what was the mood in the
7908000	7910000	room like when y'all heard you
7910000	7912000	hit that three million mark
7912000	7914000	so truth be
7914000	7916000	told I actually was not in the
7916000	7918000	stream room for the finale something
7918000	7920000	that was super fun was that they
7920000	7922000	actually had GDQ broadcasting
7922000	7924000	on one of the in hotel channels
7924000	7926000	so as long as you were in the same
7926000	7928000	DoubleTree hotel as the event you could
7928000	7930000	just tune in and watch from the comfort of your room
7930000	7932000	which I was doing because my
7932000	7934000	sleep schedule was very upside down
7934000	7936000	because waking up at
7936000	7938000	7 a.m. for an 8 a.m.
7938000	7940000	shift oh man I yeah
7940000	7942000	I needless to say I was just up
7942000	7944000	literally all night did the shift and then
7944000	7946000	knocked out for the day so I got
7946000	7948000	comfortable and I'm not I'm not I'm not
7948000	7950000	truth be told I am not a huge
7950000	7952000	fan of being in that
7952000	7954000	type of a situation like with that
7954000	7956000	the critical mass of people
7956000	7958000	as much as it is it's still a room
7958000	7960000	packed full standing room
7960000	7962000	only of the of the streamer
7962000	7964000	for the very thing so
7964000	7966000	truth be told I only saw it
7966000	7968000	like I did the rest of you however
7968000	7970000	I did go downstairs
7970000	7972000	immediately on the conclusion
7972000	7974000	because that way I could I could seek out
7974000	7976000	friends like I said I was talking to
7976000	7978000	Miss sporadic immediately
7978000	7980000	afterwards as well and I was talking to
7980000	7982000	some of the some of the specific
7982000	7984000	failures that were going on during her
7984000	7986000	shift I don't know if anybody
7986000	7988000	else noticed this but she accidentally
7988000	7990000	left the mic on
7990000	7992000	it was about an hour
7992000	7994000	and a half before
7994000	7996000	the finale but before the end of
7996000	7998000	that run or something like that she
7998000	8000000	inadvertently left the mic on and she
8000000	8002000	was actually just talking to
8002000	8004000	the hosting coordinator right over
8004000	8006000	her shoulder that was like I don't think
8006000	8008000	we're gonna it was it was either for a
8008000	8010000	donation incentive or something like that but she was just kind of like
8010000	8012000	I don't think we're gonna make this one
8012000	8014000	and she
8014000	8016000	said it so quick and then she realized
8016000	8018000	that she heard it back to the headset and she immediately
8018000	8020000	just I am so
8020000	8022000	sorry about that and then
8022000	8024000	and then killed her headset I
8024000	8026000	killed the microphone
8026000	8028000	so I got a little bit of
8028000	8030000	chuckle out of that and then I ribbed her for it because we were
8030000	8032000	like I said we were talking a little bit and just
8032000	8034000	maybe it motivated
8034000	8036000	the internet out of spite to make that goal
8036000	8038000	happen
8038000	8040000	she said exactly the same thing and like
8040000	8042000	there's no there's no formula for this stuff she was
8042000	8044000	a little bit for having
8044000	8046000	to push so many
8046000	8048000	incentives because there were like
8048000	8050000	there were like 10 different incentives for Corona Trigger
8050000	8052000	alone naming every single
8052000	8054000	character plus a hundred percent
8054000	8056000	plus the three million push
8056000	8058000	just in general at the end
8058000	8060000	plus
8060000	8062000	Speccio
8062000	8064000	Speccio in the new battles
8064000	8066000	just like so many
8066000	8068000	incentives at the very very end that were just
8068000	8070000	absolutely ridiculous
8070000	8072000	to ground
8072000	8074000	all this money at the end but it was
8074000	8076000	it was truly remarkable it was truly
8076000	8078000	an event and they dropped in
8078000	8080000	they dropped in sponsorship
8080000	8082000	and Yeti and all that and all
8082000	8084000	that money I think twitch stuff
8084000	8086000	happens automatically
8086000	8088000	maybe not maybe not ads but
8088000	8090000	like they dropped in a good
8090000	8092000	400,000 or something
8092000	8094000	like that in the last 30
8094000	8096000	45 minutes just kind of cut it off and did it
8096000	8098000	and yeah to see the
8098000	8100000	production as it was
8100000	8102000	ongoing and be able to take that
8102000	8104000	and apply it to things
8104000	8106000	that I was just watching after the fact
8106000	8108000	was a really really fun experience
8108000	8110000	I'm so excited
8110000	8112000	to have you in studio again at some point
8112000	8114000	and hear even more from your experiences
8114000	8116000	but I'm going to try to wrap up because
8116000	8118000	I do want to make sure we squeeze in a few more calls here with
8118000	8120000	our time but best of luck
8120000	8122000	to you Jason if you decide to try for the announcer
8122000	8124000	thing again I know it's something that Bobby Blockwell
8124000	8126000	has talked about pursuing as well
8126000	8128000	for me personally I don't know
8128000	8130000	I can't fit in another show in my travel
8130000	8132000	schedule but you know I support you both
8132000	8134000	and I
8134000	8136000	fingers and toes crossed
8136000	8138000	yeah I don't remember if they
8138000	8140000	take volunteers for GDQX but
8140000	8142000	obviously I'm going to be keeping my ears open for that
8142000	8144000	because I already have my TwitchCon ticket and
8144000	8146000	I absolutely
8146000	8148000	intend to do this again next year so thank
8148000	8150000	thank all of you thank you specifically
8150000	8152000	and yeah have a great night
8152000	8154000	thanks Jason drive safe

8162000	8164000	alright always great to hear
8164000	8166000	from Jason here on the show
8166000	8168000	go ahead and go to another call
8168000	8170000	hi you're on Orange Lounge Radio who's this
8170000	8172000	hey what's up guys can you hear me it's Kaijuto
8172000	8174000	we sure can hey Kaijuto what's on your mind tonight
8174000	8176000	how much I just have two things I wanted to bring
8176000	8178000	up real quickly
8178000	8180000	first the Pokemon remember you guys are talking about
8180000	8182000	how certain Pokemon are not going to be in
8182000	8184000	what is it Sword and Shield
8184000	8186000	oh yes I've heard yes
8186000	8188000	yeah well
8188000	8190000	I have a theory on that I've noticed something about
8190000	8192000	Game Freaks ever since
8192000	8194000	the Pokemon games been coming out
8194000	8196000	on the 3DS because that's actually when I really started
8196000	8198000	getting into the games and like
8198000	8200000	collecting the games and all that type of stuff like I got
8200000	8202000	black and white in the DS I think
8202000	8204000	that was no actually my very first Pokemon game was
8204000	8206000	Crystal for the game for
8206000	8208000	the Game Boy Color but that was already like late
8208000	8210000	in the Game Boy Colors days
8210000	8212000	so I really started
8212000	8214000	on the DS and 3DS so anyway
8214000	8216000	what I noticed was that there's a big
8216000	8218000	change that happened in the games between the
8218000	8220000	Game Boy Color days and
8220000	8222000	the DS going into 3DS and that
8222000	8224000	it seems like Game Freaks has been really
8224000	8226000	beginning they've been getting greedy so I know
8226000	8228000	you mentioned a lot about a third game and
8228000	8230000	they haven't done a third game in years
8230000	8232000	what they usually do is they'll either do a sequel
8232000	8234000	to the two games that already
8234000	8236000	came out or they'll do like a remake
8236000	8238000	of an older game so they actually give you like
8238000	8240000	you know they'll start with the two games
8240000	8242000	and then like that next year they'll either come
8242000	8244000	out with a sequel for those two games or reimagining
8244000	8246000	like what they just recently did
8246000	8248000	with the past two Pokemon games where they
8248000	8250000	basically released the same game but with like new footage
8250000	8252000	or something and uh
8252000	8254000	I think what's going on with um
8254000	8256000	with Sword and Shield is they're
8256000	8258000	looking at DLC I think these Pokemon are gonna
8258000	8260000	come out in some type of DLC
8260000	8262000	or some type of like game update that
8262000	8264000	you're gonna have to pay for I think they're
8264000	8266000	really trying to uh milk the Pokemon stuff
8266000	8268000	perhaps I think I don't
8268000	8270000	know I don't know how the fandom would feel about that
8270000	8272000	but you know when you're kind of talking about that and then I see
8272000	8274000	in chat Act Def says
8274000	8276000	Sinnoh remakes incoming you know
8276000	8278000	maybe though what what remakes would
8278000	8280000	they be on they'd be on gen 4 remakes because they
8280000	8282000	remade gen 1, 2, and 3 and then they remade 1
8282000	8284000	again but maybe they're they might
8284000	8286000	use the engine to do some type of like gen 4
8286000	8288000	remake and then that would include at least
8288000	8290000	all the Pokemon
8290000	8292000	from 4, 3, 2, and 1 in that
8292000	8294000	remake you know and that way
8294000	8296000	they could kind of sidestep why they haven't included
8296000	8298000	things later on and then
8298000	8300000	perhaps that kind of also buys them the time
8300000	8302000	while there's another you know
8302000	8304000	Pokemon in the future I don't know
8304000	8306000	are they allowing stuff from Let's Go to go
8306000	8308000	into the new game? I don't believe
8308000	8310000	so I think that's why you have that Pokemon
8310000	8312000	home that's kind of supposed to be a
8312000	8314000	kind of catch all for all that stuff
8314000	8316000	so is it Pokemon Go into the game then?
8316000	8318000	uh as far
8318000	8320000	no I don't think your Pokemon from Pokemon Go can go
8320000	8322000	you can see catching Pokemon in Pokemon
8322000	8324000	Go is easy and
8324000	8326000	you're not getting Galar stuff
8326000	8328000	yet I mean the newest region Pokemon
8328000	8330000	is not in
8330000	8332000	say for maybe Meltan
8332000	8334000	but I don't know about that
8334000	8336000	so yeah but yeah
8336000	8338000	I've been really
8338000	8340000	ever since X and Y
8340000	8342000	when they came out with the
8342000	8344000	what was it they did a remake of
8344000	8346000	Ruby Sapphire or something
8346000	8348000	like that and I got that one in every
8348000	8350000	I mean it was a great game but ever since then
8350000	8352000	I was like oh no Game Freaks
8352000	8354000	they're going in a totally different direction
8354000	8356000	they're really going to try to milk this franchise
8356000	8358000	and I'm just not liking it now
8358000	8360000	like I said this Sword and Moon stuff
8360000	8362000	I mean it's really got me thinking that
8362000	8364000	they're going to try to mooch as much money off of this thing
8364000	8366000	as they can
8366000	8368000	I do want to say Act F does clarify in chat
8368000	8370000	Pokemon Go Mons can be transferred
8370000	8372000	to Sword and Shield through home but it won't
8372000	8374000	be every Pokemon I'm so curious
8374000	8376000	how that because you know like you have the Pokemon
8376000	8378000	based on like one kind of set of stats
8378000	8380000	in Go and I wonder how that's going to translate
8380000	8382000	I imagine if you transfer it from
8382000	8384000	Go you're not going to be able to get the best stat at stuff
8384000	8386000	or if they're going to do it from
8386000	8388000	if they're going to do it from
8388000	8390000	Go they're going to do it like they did with Go Park
8390000	8392000	where you have to go catch them again
8394000	8396000	that could very well be I got you
8396000	8398000	you got to catch them again that makes a lot of sense
8398000	8400000	actually
8400000	8402000	catch them again I like that that sounds like the title for the next game
8402000	8404000	go catch them again dammit
8404000	8406000	do it again
8406000	8408000	I love it
8408000	8410000	at the end of the day
8410000	8412000	wait at the end of the day are you picking up
8412000	8414000	Sword and Shield?
8414000	8416000	oh no I don't even have a switch yet but even if I did
8416000	8418000	I think I might
8418000	8420000	actually bail out of Pokemon this time around
8420000	8422000	and that's a first for me because
8422000	8424000	I mean actually I wasn't looking
8424000	8426000	forward to the next Pokemon game because that was another thing I wanted to
8426000	8428000	bring up was that they used to take about five
8428000	8430000	years to bring these things out and now you're just
8430000	8432000	getting a Pokemon game every year like Call of Duty
8432000	8434000	and every
8434000	8436000	year I've been getting more and more sour towards
8436000	8438000	the franchise so I doubt even if I
8438000	8440000	had a switch I doubt that I'll be
8440000	8442000	trying to get the Sword and Moon at least on the first day
8442000	8444000	usually I get them on the first day but
8444000	8446000	I doubt I would get that game day one I totally
8446000	8448000	doubt it even if like I said if I had a
8448000	8450000	switch or not
8450000	8452000	alright so real
8452000	8454000	quickly the Google Stadia I wanted to bring up
8454000	8456000	please real quick yeah
8456000	8458000	my main issue with
8458000	8460000	that is alright so you're
8460000	8462000	playing these games off of a cloud
8462000	8464000	you don't actually own the game
8464000	8466000	you're playing it off a server or whatever
8466000	8468000	what happens when somebody like
8468000	8470000	me I buy that little niche game that I
8470000	8472000	really like but it's not really that popular
8472000	8474000	and one day they run out of
8474000	8476000	they run out of space for all the
8476000	8478000	games that they collect on these servers and then they decide
8478000	8480000	oh you know your game isn't that popular enough
8480000	8482000	we're gonna remove it from the system
8482000	8484000	just to make room for these more popular games
8484000	8486000	what happens then?
8486000	8488000	considering Google has been very big on
8488000	8490000	just let's add more space and the
8490000	8492000	the cost of or the
8492000	8494000	technology of data gets
8494000	8496000	it seems to get like cheaper and cheaper like your Google
8496000	8498000	inbox just keeps growing and growing and growing and the
8498000	8500000	amount that they let you put in there like
8500000	8502000	I've probably actually
8502000	8504000	gotten enough mail at this point
8504000	8506000	that Google's original threshold for the
8506000	8508000	inbox I've probably met but they keep
8508000	8510000	expanding it so I don't know if the
8510000	8512000	data and the storage
8512000	8514000	if that is really going to become a question
8514000	8516000	but I don't want to discount your point
8516000	8518000	of delisting because
8518000	8520000	sometimes it's rights issues
8520000	8522000	license issues
8522000	8524000	music issues those things
8524000	8526000	I think would be a little bit more of a
8526000	8528000	I might be concerned about that than I would be
8528000	8530000	the
8530000	8532000	data side of things so what would happen
8532000	8534000	maybe if a licensing right or a music right
8534000	8536000	expired would a game get pulled from
8536000	8538000	Stadia and then what happens to your money
8538000	8540000	at that point now I would assume
8540000	8542000	assume that it's
8542000	8544000	got to be written into these contracts
8544000	8546000	with the game makers is that you can't
8546000	8548000	do that like if you put your game on this
8548000	8550000	platform you are not going to be able to pull it
8550000	8552000	for any reason for at least
8552000	8554000	maybe that like new copies
8554000	8556000	can stop being sold and maybe that's how they get
8556000	8558000	around the license thing but you will not be
8558000	8560000	able to ever pull this game completely
8560000	8562000	from the service and if they didn't put that
8562000	8564000	in the contracts they are
8564000	8566000	yikes
8566000	8568000	well good thing you bring that up
8568000	8570000	I just want to bring up one other thing I know that you guys
8570000	8572000	got to get home and everything but at
8572000	8574000	least Loki has to get home you're already home so
8574000	8576000	but anyway
8576000	8578000	what I noticed Google Play
8578000	8580000	they're also a part of Google right
8580000	8582000	like you know like they
8582000	8584000	they're technically Google right
8584000	8586000	Google Play on the alright so what I've
8586000	8588000	noticed is that there's been plenty of games that I
8588000	8590000	bought off of the Google Play Store
8590000	8592000	and then one day I
8592000	8594000	log in and my games are gone
8594000	8596000	I don't get I don't get
8596000	8598000	refunded half the time
8598000	8600000	they're just gone so like I wonder
8600000	8602000	you know you talk about their space and all that stuff
8602000	8604000	and like they're just pulling stuff on the
8604000	8606000	Android store they also do it on
8606000	8608000	the Amazon too I have the Amazon Kindle
8608000	8610000	and they remove a lot of games there too and that's
8610000	8612000	mostly because
8612000	8614000	developers are just taking them off
8614000	8616000	for whatever reason or they're not getting updated
8616000	8618000	I think these are questions that Google
8618000	8620000	is going to have to take years to prove the answers
8620000	8622000	to as we kind of referenced earlier and
8622000	8624000	I don't know I don't know if Google's
8624000	8626000	going to do it their track record doesn't make me
8626000	8628000	very hopeful but we'll see we'll
8628000	8630000	see what they're willing to say in the coming months
8630000	8632000	especially as you know
8632000	8634000	the it's about to release and the pro version
8634000	8636000	comes out and those original numbers about
8636000	8638000	who's using it end up coming out so we'll
8638000	8640000	see we'll keep an eye on it well
8640000	8642000	thanks for taking my call there like I said no
8642000	8644000	shield and sword for me and no Google
8644000	8646000	Stadia they can go fuck themselves

8722000	8724000	I saw something in like my Google
8724000	8726000	news feed earlier about
8726000	8728000	I
8728000	8730000	had to find the story now because
8730000	8732000	it was on my phone but it was something to do
8732000	8734000	with we are going to close up
8734000	8736000	Discord for the night by the way so sorry if you
8736000	8738000	didn't get through but please consider leaving a
8738000	8740000	question in the chat or of course you can always send us an email
8740000	8742000	to participate at
8742000	8744000	OrangeLoungeRadio.com it was about
8744000	8746000	VR and it was Walmart using
8746000	8748000	it to pick middle managers using
8748000	8750000	VR
8750000	8752000	they were using VR training
8752000	8754000	I don't know what
8754000	8756000	necessarily they were doing with that but
8756000	8758000	that reminds me of like that
8758000	8760000	one I don't know if anyone's seen the game
8760000	8762000	play video of the KFC
8762000	8764000	VR game which I totally want to play at
8764000	8766000	some point I don't know how to get to
8766000	8768000	it but apparently it's like some VR game
8768000	8770000	that they have for KFC it's fucking weird
8770000	8772000	it's like Burger King
8772000	8774000	games I feel like that came up on the show
8774000	8776000	not that long ago it was the KFC training
8776000	8778000	we talked about that on the show a few weeks ago it was a while ago
8778000	8780000	but yeah it's interesting
8780000	8782000	it's about time Burger King or
8782000	8784000	KFC or McDonald's I don't give
8784000	8786000	a shit who makes a fucking weird ass game
8786000	8788000	but it's about time that we had some weird
8788000	8790000	ass games based on food franchises
8790000	8792000	and I'll be honest it's the
8792000	8794000	time for VR we need fucking weird
8794000	8796000	ass creepy shit
8796000	8798000	food franchise
8798000	8800000	VR games I just hope I want them now
8800000	8802000	I just hope the VR training games are teaching them
8802000	8804000	to double check the order before they
8804000	8806000	pass it to the customer no I want it fucking creepy
8806000	8808000	as shit I want it sneak king shit
8808000	8810000	that this is what I'm looking for
8812000	8814000	I miss those Burger King games from the icebox
8814000	8816000	they're so so interesting
8816000	8818000	so I think back where there is with it
8818000	8820000	is that backwards compatible yet Emma can I get that
8820000	8822000	as part of my games with gold
8822000	8824000	that would be worth it right there
8824000	8826000	come on Burger King make it happen
