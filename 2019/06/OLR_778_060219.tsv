0	27000	This week we've learned that Uno is the most popular Overwatch workshop mode. What better way to cool down from a hectic battle than by skip, drop, forward, reverse and Uno dominating your opponents. This is just one card in hand. Stay tuned for the rest of the week's gaming news starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.
28000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
32000	47000	Hello my friends out there on the internet. Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio Live tonight with episode number 778 for this June the 2nd of 2019. We are back after a week off.
48000	60000	Celebrating what's going on in video games, gaming culture and the gamer lifestyle here in studio live at twitch.tv slash vog network myself Rob Roberts and joining me as always DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
61000	67000	Sup bitches. Hi how are you welcome back. I'm feeling sassy Rob. Yeah are you relaxed and refreshed after a vacation?
68000	84000	Alright let me come back to you in a minute because I also have to introduce. Just two words. Sure. Con crud. Yes we'll talk about that too. Joining us of course you can see over there at twitch.tv you can see to my right but left on tv because everything is backwards. Techmaster Loki.
85000	95000	We're in the mirrorverse. We are in the mirrorverse. How are you doing? I'm fine. You did not have a vacation last week. No I ended up working all weekend for the most part.
95000	107000	I saw you were streaming during OLR's time. You were doing some DVR. Yeah I was just streaming because I didn't get twitch affiliate or something like that but I haven't quite gotten there yet because I need to stream more days.
108000	118000	And I just didn't feel like it this week because the garage is hot again. Summer is coming. So I have been streaming on and off but I'll try to do a little bit more.
119000	139000	Well now she mentioned the downside to traveling is con crud and I know I picked up sick. She picked up sick. How are you feeling? I'm fine but the scare I have right now is that like last week or something like that we got a message that someone at the school has chicken pox.
140000	153000	Oh yeah I saw your tweet about this. I haven't had chicken pox and I'm not with your cool kids that are young and hip and everything like that and have gotten their shots so they don't get chicken pox. I'm just rolling the dice.
154000	164000	Wait have you not been vaccinated? I am an anti-vax chicken poxer. Can't you fix that? I could but I hate shots and I'm too lazy to go down there. You really should think about it.
164000	172000	Yeah I should. Keep in mind you could get shingles instead. I understand that my sister has had chicken pox three times and I've never caught it so meh.
173000	187000	I wouldn't roll the dice. Just suck it up and do it. Fine. Here's the thing. I used to hate shots too and then remember that year that I was really sick. I had the pancreatitis, gallbladder, all that stuff. I had my blood drawn like 500 times so I got used to it. You just have to look the other way.
187000	196000	No I get it. And just not think about it. I get it. And a good phlebotomist. Is that what they're called? A good phlebotomist will talk to you about something else and distract you and not even telling you when they're doing it.
197000	202000	Yeah. Fine. You can do it. Don't be a baby. It's fine.
203000	207000	Just breathe. Whatever. Breathe in and then exhale when the needle goes in.
208000	219000	Over in our chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network because we do tape live at the voice geeks network twitch.tv slash vog network every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific nine o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Black Wolf show except last week.
220000	231000	So I hope you all had a good I hope you had a good three day weekend and Memorial Day was good for you guys. And looking in chat S.J. 100 Matt says I think CVS does them cheap also.
232000	243000	Yeah it's I can go and get it done for free at the lab. I mean I'm active simply says don't be that guy. I won't be that guy. I will do it. It's just good boy. Here's a cookie.
244000	251000	Maybe the kids can give you a tip to answer S.J. 100 Matt's question will the DDR overheat in the summer in the garage.
251000	269000	No I don't think so. I don't think it gets I mean it does get really hot out there but it was fine last summer. So I'd assume that it's fine still. But you know then again my other arcade cabinet broke in the garage so I don't know.
270000	278000	It should be fine though. And it doesn't matter if it breaks then I'm just put a new thing in there anyways a PC to put step mania on there so it's all good.
278000	292000	Let's talk a little bit about our our weeks away. It is a video game show and I know you didn't do a lot about video games and I only partially did so we'll just quickly recap our weekend off Dark Sakura. How was your trip.
293000	301000	Oh God. OK. So we got E3 hype coming up but I know some people want to know the personal stuff so let's indulge quickly.
301000	316000	All right. So I got in my car and zoomed on down ninety nine quickly. Yes. OK. So I went to drag con and I went there as a sister and there were sister panels and we cut.
316000	328000	Well the people on the panel got talent badges. So guess who took a talent badge to the green room the last day of the convention. That would be me. I got to meet Nina West.
329000	341000	Nice. I got to meet the Belay brothers. I these are all famous drag queens people that don't know. And I got to meet Loki. Now you may laugh at this because I met Tempest Dujour in line to get a mimosa.
341000	351000	Who was wearing a plastic necklace that said fuck Trixie. Because she's like Oh I like your necklace. What does it say. Mine says Chava because that's my sister name Chava Kiki. Yeah.
352000	362000	And she's like Oh do you like mine. It said fuck Trixie. I was like they're friends though so yeah. They took pictures together. And you know Gia had like the most beautiful set but I don't think I took a picture of it.
363000	367000	But anyway I had a great time. I met so many people. I met Ginger Minj. I met Raja finally.
367000	374000	Did you plug VOG Network with all them queens them gamer queens. Yes I did mention to the gamer queens. Good. Good job.
375000	385000	But I had a great time. And then on Monday I went to San Diego to visit some other sisters who are friends of mine and they took me up Highway 1 at the coast up into Carlsbad and everything. It was pretty beautiful.
386000	393000	And I went to Extraordinary Desserts which is like my favorite dessert place in the universe. And then Tuesday I did Solo Disney.
393000	399000	Solo Disney. We were talking about this a little bit before because I was kind of like oh I wonder if Disneyland would actually be fun by yourself.
400000	409000	But then when you kind of started to make your case I was like yeah you know what actually when you get to do things at your own pace and you're you're not worried about anybody else's agenda and you just kind of get to do your own thing I bet it would be a lot of fun.
410000	418000	And you know what it was fucking fun. Single writer lines. Yeah. And you just missed the Star Wars thing though right. I didn't care about Star Wars shit. Yeah.
418000	427000	I'll go to that shit later. Later after after this stereotypes down. Exactly. So I mean like I finally did in credit coaster. I did the cars right as many times as I want to.
428000	436000	I did single writer on everything I could get away doing single writer on. You know when my neck got stiff I went on Indiana Jones to have it pop my neck like you do.
436000	446000	I did Haunted Mansion. I did I even did the Roger Rabbit thing. So I mean I went into to town. I actually found two quiet spots in the park.
447000	460000	One of them is this little restaurant is called like the Harbor Cafe or something. And it's right across from Haunted Mansion and it's actually really quiet. You can find seating there and it overlooks a bit of the lagoon there and no one will bother you.
460000	474000	It's quiet and lobster rolls and then another little places in to town right when you go in through the gates and then off to the left there's like this little circular seating area and really no one loud goes there.
475000	488000	I think it's like oh my God my kids are fucking driving me nuts place you know. And then the other fun thing is I got my picture taken with their Captain Marvel who she's a little too skinny to be a good Captain Marvel but she was very good adequate.
488000	497000	Yes I was wearing my Captain Marvel skater dress. So she asked me what powers I had and I was like I'm binary era and she just grinned. So apparently she got it.
498000	505000	She's probably heard it all too. Yeah but you know and then I got a kid from it. I got a hug from a two year old.
505000	509000	Wait you took a kid at Disneyland. How much does a kid cost Disneyland.
510000	517000	I got jelly beans to keep my blood sugar up because you can actually there's like a jelly belly selection thing over at the Winnie the Pooh thing.
518000	529000	So I got that trucked back over to California adventure. My feet were kind of dead by the end of the day but there's these two little kids in line and their mama was from Alabama originally and moved to Nevada.
529000	535000	So we were just chatting in line and I was giving her kids jelly beans because it was keeping them from climbing all over the poles and everything.
536000	537000	That's very nice of you to give other people's kids sugar.
538000	548000	Well she was fine with it I asked. But anyway the little boys like will you ride with us. And I'm like well I'll be behind you. I forgot the monster's ink thing is three cars deep.
548000	556000	So I ended up in their car anyway I was like OK. Looks like I'm riding with y'all. And we got to the end and the little boys OK come with us now.
557000	566000	They're like no I'm going to go over to where the champagne is and get adult beverages and Auntie Jamie's got a date with mimosas.
567000	574000	Oh no they have this like lavender lemonade champagne thing that it's expensive because it's fucking Disney but it was good.
574000	588000	I also found out my Starbucks Starbucks app works at Disneyland. Yeah. So anyway but the little girl turns around and looks up at me with these big cute little eyes and those her arms around my legs and I'm like my heart's gonna break.
589000	600000	I normally don't like children but this is the most adorable thing in the universe. And so I got down on my knees and I gave her a big hug after getting the OK from her mama because I don't hug other people's kids without consent.
600000	615000	And her mom's like that is the cutest thing I've ever seen her do. And she's normally pretty shy. So so little little Zoe and little Luke you are the cutest kids at Disneyland and you win all the Disney's ever.
616000	628000	That's a nice story. Yeah. So that that made my day. And then I ran into our friend Bobby who gave me a drive home from not Bobby but no not Bobby Black Lady Bobby Lady Bobby. Yeah.
629000	640000	Who gave me a ride so I didn't have to order a lift. OK. And took me by CVS so I could get something for the dang blister between my toes. Oh no no. I've got a gnarly blister between my toes.
640000	659000	So that was what I did quickly my week. I went to Chicago. One last thing. Bravo Cheese Farm. OK. I went to Chicago. I go about once a year to see my friends out there. I'm pretty tight with some former podcasters and current podcasters that live out there and you know I go out there about once a year just hang out and had a good time.
660000	672000	It timed it this year up with the big Ingress event that was the weekend and it was there was a lot going on because I did a thing Friday night that this thing called Intel Ops which was like it was supposed to be like an escape room but like out in the city.
673000	683000	So it started off kind of neat like all spy games like we got texted a message that said meet this person at this diner at this location. It had a little thing and it said say this phrase to him and I'll say it back to you or whatever.
684000	691000	So we went over there and then the guy gave us a suitcase with a phone in it and then we got another text message that said use this phone to go hack this portal. We're like OK.
692000	698000	And then we got another text message. Now go use the phone to hack this portal. OK. Now go hack this portal. OK. Go hack this portal.
699000	712000	So unfortunately it started off strong but then it just kind of turned into wild goose chase like I felt like I guess they. Meanwhile we heard other groups were like raiding hotel rooms and others so I don't know I think I think they still have some things to work out about making it interesting for everybody.
713000	721000	So it started off really interesting. And then Saturday was the big anomaly event and we lost by four points.
722000	742000	And it's it's going to be a very interesting kind of controversial thing because the play box was a solid green my team and the blue team ended up winning because and I'm not going to complain about the rules I'm not gonna be a bitter Betty because they there was different games going on some of them were a little more invisible like the media game and the hacking the portals game and their strategy was to really push those games as much as they could.
743000	753000	And they were successful in what they did. But I think it is going to kind of cause a discussion about is that kind of what you want the ingress anomaly to be so to be interesting to see like moving forward kind of what that does.
754000	766000	But I'm not you know. Hey they read the rules they had a good strategy. Kudos to them. I'm not going to not go be a bit better about it because I think I actually made an Instagram post it was something like I should be bitter we lost that anomaly but I feel fucking good today.
766000	775000	Like I'm like I'm on vacation. The air is nice today. I'm with my friends. I don't give a shit that we lost. It's just a game whatever.
776000	792000	So yeah that was that was that and then Sunday they do this thing called mission day so I make it sound like I did nothing but play the game and I did do that a lot but I was able to mix in other things in there so like Alan and I went out and had a nice dinner at Benihana which is why I wasn't on Bobby show last week with a call.
792000	801000	We you know got to go out to some clubs and things of that sort so I had a good time. I had a good trip to Chicago. Not a lot of gaming outside of the ingress stuff. I didn't even play Pokemon Go.
802000	812000	Like there was like the shiny lappers thing happened. I was so fixated on what we were doing for ingress and honestly I haven't touched Pokemon Go in days which for me is a lot.
812000	821000	I usually check it once a day. I let my streak go. I feel like I'm level 40. I've caught everything that's reasonable.
822000	831000	The amount of experience you get for the streak is like very minimal anyways and like item wise you know with gifts and everything it's like oh no I'm missing out on the item bonus.
831000	839000	That reminds me I need to send gifts to people and I did go kind of nuts on Pokemon at Disneyland and I did a little bit of ingress but most of Disneyland was green.
840000	843000	So I take that back. Most of Disneyland was blue.
844000	845000	Oh then you needed the bursters.
846000	850000	Wait. No no it was green. Sorry. I'm trying to remember the right color because it's the one that Shane doesn't like.
851000	858000	Anyway. So yeah that was essentially my trip in a nutshell. I'll talk a little more about some of the specific games I played during my gaming week.
859000	865000	We didn't end up going to the barcade or anything like that this time. It was pretty much ingress was the only game I was playing over those few days.
866000	871000	But I played some Switch stuff on the plane and I played some other games throughout the week so I had a good week off.
872000	875000	Except the whole getting sick part like leaving Chicago fucking sucked.
875000	883000	So I mean everything was beautiful during the time we were there but the day we left so we left on Monday Memorial Day and I don't know if you guys heard on the news or whatever.
884000	888000	But like Midway Airport like shut down for like two hours like no flights are coming in or anything like that.
889000	898000	So our flight got hosed. We were delayed going back. We didn't get back to Oakland California until midnight Pacific time which is 2 a.m. central time at that point.
899000	902000	And so I think I didn't get home and crawl into my bed until two thirty Pacific.
903000	904000	Wow. And then I had to work the next day.
905000	913000	Well I was pretty crappy. Yeah I was pretty crappy. But that's that's the risk you take when you book a late flight is that there might especially out of Chicago where there might be you know huge thunderstorms.
914000	920000	But it worked out. So anyway let's get into video games. So it is a video game show. We had to get some of the personal stuff out of the way.
921000	925000	Let's talk about a lot of hype going on. Not I mean we have some news to talk about tonight.
926000	931000	Not as many leaks as I would thought by now. That's very true. But we still have the whole week.
931000	938000	It's quiet right now relatively. I mean I've seen some gaming week news that get pretty busy this week was relatively quiet even past two weeks.
939000	943000	I mean if we had done a show last week there wouldn't have been a lot to talk about. There's a few things not not a lot.
944000	957000	So you know now that we're back this week we have enough to fill out a show tonight but it's relatively light all things considered because E3 a week from today will be underway by the time our next episode is underway.
957000	967000	Microsoft will have said this is our plan for the holiday season with their press conference. So we know some things about where Microsoft's going right Loki.
968000	983000	Yes so they are going to have about 14 games to show off during E3. So you may remember last year they talked about all these different company acquisitions that they did bringing them under the Microsoft Game Studios platform.
984000	986000	And now we're going to see the fruit of that labor.
987000	991000	I'm kind of surprised it's this soon. I would have still given it two or three years.
992000	999000	Not everything necessarily is going to be coming out this year. I assume they could announce stuff that's going to be coming out could have already been in development when they had 2019.
1000000	1012000	I would say maybe early 2020 you could even see maybe some like later announcements like we still have you know like Halo Infinite that they teased like just so briefly last year and now we'll probably see more of that.
1012000	1023000	Battletoads was a big battle. Yes. So that'll be awesome. So there's lots of stuff and it's about time because they really need like games on that platform.
1024000	1034000	They need a reason why I want to buy an Xbox. Although nowadays with everything coming on PC I don't really need to buy an Xbox because my PC is an Xbox in that sense.
1034000	1041000	So whatever. Win win. Well speaking of hardware do we think we kind of know where Microsoft might end up with that.
1042000	1044000	I don't know. Are we going to see the announcement of the next platform.
1045000	1054000	That's kind of where my head is at because I mean could we see because we got a teaser last year. Remember right. They did sort of drop that what Project Scorpion or whatever they're calling it.
1055000	1060000	They dropped that little teaser right at the end. So you kind of wonder like are we. But wasn't Scorpio the Xbox One X.
1061000	1067000	Oh maybe maybe I can't even remember. I thought we got a little teaser right at the end that was indicating something else.
1068000	1078000	Well I think that they're like saying yeah we're working on another console but I don't know. It would be neat to see if that's what we're going to see or that's going to be part of the announcement is some of these games going to be on the next console.
1079000	1087000	Well the other interesting thing. Remember Microsoft has already said that they anticipate their future games will run on Xbox One.
1087000	1099000	They're trying to get a little more platform agnostic I suppose is that yes there will be another console that will run the games better, faster, smoother, more graphics and all that.
1100000	1104000	But that these games will work on Xbox One. It's going to be similar to a PC.
1104000	1113000	Yeah like well a PC or if you play a game on an iPhone 6 it'll work but it might be a little bit stuttery. You know it might be might have some frame rate problems.
1114000	1120000	But if you play it on an iPhone 10 or you know the newer ones whatever the 10 are whatever it's going to be very smooth very you know very high def.
1121000	1128000	I would be curious to see like with these new consoles what they're going to be pushing how they're going to be pushing these consoles because really fidelity right now.
1128000	1137000	It's I mean granted like I say Xbox One like hardware and even the PlayStation 4 like that stuff is relatively old by today's standards.
1138000	1144000	But like fidelity wise it's just like I don't know how much better we can really get.
1145000	1151000	Again graphics aren't everything. You could make the game look immensely pretty but it doesn't mean it's going to be a better game.
1151000	1161000	So I'd be curious to see what they're going to leverage to try to make people more interested in those platforms you know like modding user generated stuff that would be kind of cool.
1162000	1167000	I know definitely Microsoft's been more open about that versus Sony which definitely that weighs in a lot if I'm going to be purchasing another system.
1168000	1169000	For you. For me yeah.
1170000	1176000	Act Deft in chat says at Twitch TV slash VOG Network the next gen Xbox is called Scarlet. That was the name of it.
1177000	1179000	So and I could swear we got a little teaser at the end.
1180000	1184000	Why we are in chat is asking but is fidelity good at 4K and how's the frame rate.
1185000	1188000	I mean I don't know.
1189000	1198000	That's Microsoft answer right. Yeah that's that's really I mean 4K looks nice but like it's not everything that's out there is running at native 4K anyways.
1199000	1206000	I actually think it's very interesting and I'm so curious what the future for Microsoft like three years from now is going to look like.
1207000	1214000	Because I do think it's very interesting that they are taking and you know now that we're hearing that the focus of E3 sounds like it's going to be games games games.
1214000	1221000	I think it's very interesting that they are taking the focus off a console like maybe Microsoft will announce a console.
1222000	1229000	But maybe that's not where they want the focus like they want you to be focusing on these games and the fact that the games you can buy on your Xbox One.
1230000	1237000	You can buy their little subscription service and play the games there or you can play on PC because we know Microsoft kind of wants to be more a platform.
1237000	1246000	So maybe Microsoft is starting to kind of dial back how much stock they're putting in their hardware so to speak and really focus.
1247000	1254000	And it's a very interesting sort of contrast to the expectation I think out of Sony right now not just like something that Sony is putting on themselves.
1255000	1259000	But if you read about the media you always hear about PlayStation 5 what Sony doing for PlayStation 5.
1259000	1263000	Oh they're taking this year off of E3 because they're working on PlayStation 5.
1264000	1272000	And I feel like the conversation when it comes to Sony is very much about this incremental step up where I feel like Microsoft is not setting that same expectation.
1273000	1274000	It's very interesting to me.
1274000	1280000	Yeah aside from Microsoft too that's not the only company that's going to be having lots of announcements.
1281000	1293000	So for example there was a leak from GameStop employees saying that there's like 21 placeholder SKUs for Switch games as well.
1294000	1298000	So we're going to be seeing I'm sure lots of Switch game announcements coming out of E3 as well.
1299000	1300000	I'm not super surprised to hear that.
1300000	1305000	The Switch has been doing really well. Nintendo is not in the same position with the Switch as they were with the Wii U.
1306000	1309000	They have third party support so I anticipate we're not just going to have first part.
1310000	1314000	We know we're getting Animal Crossing. We know Metroid something's probably happening.
1315000	1316000	Probably not Metroid Prime 4 because they're rebooting that right.
1317000	1322000	But maybe like Metroid Collection and there's probably something we don't know about yet that they will unveil.
1323000	1326000	There will probably be another type of who knows something.
1327000	1328000	But then there's probably going to be a bunch of third party stuff.
1328000	1332000	Sega has been a very big supporter of Nintendo. Maybe a Sonic something something.
1333000	1342000	We've got Square might continue their relationship and put something who knows like another remaster or something on the Switch.
1343000	1344000	And you know Bandai Namco I'm sure is going to do something.
1345000	1346000	So I feel like there's going to be a lot of third party support.
1347000	1351000	Oh Bayonetta 3. Hello. That's probably a big thing for the Switch this year.
1351000	1356000	So 21 games when you kind of put first and third party together through the holiday.
1357000	1362000	That's actually like I know it sounds like a lot and it is but it's kind of like that's that's what I would that's what I would kind of hope for.
1363000	1365000	Yeah. Yeah. So. All right. Be interesting.
1366000	1369000	Going to chat for some more comments over at Twitch TV slash VOG Network.
1370000	1376000	Bobby Blackwell says one of the things I like about the PlayStation 5 is the idea of the faster load times because of the solid state drive.
1376000	1381000	So if Xbox can copy that idea and also decrease load times that'd be awesome.
1382000	1386000	Agreed. Yeah. Yeah. I think a very logical step certainly for the system.
1387000	1392000	YYR saying that's why there's new consoles coming. Also ray tracing will be a thing.
1393000	1399000	Kaijuto asking how does 4K enhance my gameplay. I'm more into innovating gameplay not the new shiny.
1400000	1402000	I think it's kind of a different strokes for different folks argument.
1402000	1409000	I mean like when I play a Final Fantasy game historically you know Final Fantasy is that series I've always thought of as like really cutting edge with graphics right.
1410000	1416000	And I do get really excited when I see like oh this game looks gorgeous and I think graphics can really like grab your attention.
1417000	1424000	It is a fine balance. You can't just push like good graphics. You also have to have the gameplay because really it can it can look like anything in the gameplay is not there.
1424000	1426000	And if the gameplay is not there it's not going to matter.
1427000	1433000	And we all know in 2019 graphics don't always you know you don't have to have cutting edge 4K graphics to have a wonderful game.
1434000	1436000	I mean retro style games hello are all the rage right.
1437000	1439000	Whether they have that game that just came out I think this week Gato Roboto.
1440000	1446000	Yeah. Which is like you know looks like a Game Boy black and white type game you know it's like an Metroidvania with a cat.
1447000	1448000	Space cat.
1449000	1452000	Minecraft continues to be a powerhouse. A lot of these roguelikes are retro inspired.
1452000	1456000	Minecraft 2. We're getting Minecraft 2 this year. It's part of you know 14 games maybe.
1457000	1458000	You know I.
1459000	1468000	Speaking of high fidelity Microsoft when are we getting that 4K texture pack. Is it that the next gen Xbox is the only thing that could really push those 4K graphics.
1469000	1472000	There's just certain things I've said year after year and this is the year I'm just going to stop.
1473000	1479000	So when it comes to Minecraft 2 I'm just I'm not putting that out there this year because I've been let down every other time maybe if I don't say it this year it'll happen.
1479000	1484000	But I agree the 4K pack is something that probably needs to happen first.
1485000	1491000	Renji221 with a pretty good guess. My guess is we're getting the second smash DLC character during the direct as well.
1492000	1497000	Let's talk about predictions for a minute. You know in years past we've done a fun little like list list segment.
1498000	1502000	I don't know if we really I mean E3 is just kind of a different show now than it was several years ago.
1503000	1506000	We already know like yeah he's not going to be there. We already know certain things are going to be happening.
1506000	1513000	So but what do you what do you think might be some E3 predictions that we just we don't know yet.
1514000	1522000	I would think let's see I'd be curious to see what Sony is going to announce. I know they don't really have a presence at E3.
1523000	1530000	They're doing their own thing but you know they're going to do like probably whatever their direct thing is around the same time.
1530000	1538000	I'd be curious to see what they have to announce. I'm from Nintendo. I can see another Labo announcement for them.
1539000	1543000	I'm not going to buy it though because I already have enough cardboard crap laying around my house.
1544000	1546000	Although we did use it this week so there's that.
1547000	1554000	Microsoft I really don't know because they've got just so many I think we're going to see a lot of new IPs from Microsoft which is good.
1555000	1563000	Probably Forza Horizon or Forza 5. I would imagine. I mean it just seems like it's not Horizon. This is no.
1564000	1570000	No it'd be Forza. Yeah maybe some Mortar Sport I think it'd be up to eight now. Is it. I think it was the last game.
1571000	1579000	OK. I'm playing. Yeah. Yeah. OK. So Forza 8. What else. I'm trying to think.
1580000	1586000	I don't know. Can we get some DLC for like Crackdown 3 to make me actually want to play it again because I've stopped playing that game.
1587000	1595000	I'm not having fun with it anymore. It would be cool if we got some VR thing from Microsoft and maybe do the mixed reality stuff I guess.
1596000	1603000	But like maybe actually Xbox wise would be kind of cool. I don't know. I just want something like out of left field.
1604000	1614000	You know what. I'm going to put all my all my chips on the Amico. OK. I need to have all of like the amazing announcements coming from the television side.
1615000	1623000	That's right. Chuckle. But at the same time I'm super curious like what their plan is. I actually legit want to see some of what they're working on. Yeah.
1624000	1633000	I don't know. I don't really know would be like really like I want a new Saints Row game can get a new Saints Row game reboot that shit.
1634000	1645000	All right. I'm going to say I think you know obviously you know Microsoft has very different leadership now and I think they're a lot more in tune with what their players are kind of asking for and what they want than they were historically.
1645000	1658000	Long story short I think I think a Fable 4 is in the works. Yeah I can see that. I think Microsoft probably knows that role playing games RPGs fantasies is kind of one of their weak points whereas Fable was historically a strong point for them.
1659000	1668000	And I wouldn't be surprised if they gave Fable to one of their other. Well didn't do wasn't speaking of horizon wasn't the thing that turned 10 was working on an RPG or something.
1668000	1678000	So I don't know I kind of I feel like Fable 4 is going to be a thing if not that then Microsoft's got some time maybe because of Molinu not really being involved anymore which may not be a bad thing.
1679000	1688000	Oh who cares. Maybe they're going to maybe they're going to launch a new IP that's a new RPG. Yes I'm sure I'm sure Fable is just going to suffer from Molinu not being part of it.
1689000	1701000	No but it might be complicated in using Fable. If they do a Fable it has to be completely off the rails. Oh sure. Completely. Oh you mean like a role playing game like a real role playing game.
1702000	1713000	Oh you oh you want it to be more like Dragon Age. OK. Although I would totally be down for a medieval saints. Right. Yeah actually it's just so stupid that I love that.
1713000	1722000	I did evil Saints Row would that be fun. Monty Python the Holy Grail like as a game. And then at the end you get arrested by the police and then a moose fights your sister.
1723000	1735000	I could I could be down with that. I love I love the absurdity. Dear Eric Idol. Talk to your buddies. But like it can't be seen. So it's got to be like its own franchise but like Saints Row just medieval.
1735000	1746000	OK. It would be called Saints Row. Jamie what about you as far as like what do you what do you hope. I mean we know we're not going to see anything from Sony but we know we've got Square probably talking about the seven remake.
1747000	1756000	We've got Nintendo. Twenty one possible titles. We've got Microsoft with four about Bethesda. What do you think Bethesda is going to be announcing during our show that we're not going to stop for.
1757000	1764000	What other continents are there. Let me come back to that. In the world of Elder Scrolls. Oh well we know we're not getting Elder Scrolls. Oh and Elder Scrolls online expansion.
1765000	1777000	Oh yeah probably. Maybe. Yeah. I don't know. I really kind of stopped predicting certain things just because I've developed this sort of thing that I want to be.
1778000	1788000	You set an expectation and then ultimately get let down when you use many predictions. I want to find only I want to be delighted by something you know you're getting Animal Crossing.
1788000	1805000	So yeah that's really all I give a shit about. But in the end though I really want to be pleasantly surprised by what comes out. I want it to be a oh well I wasn't expecting that instead of me going oh you're going to do this it's going to be great and it ends up being shit.
1806000	1821000	Well let me ask let me ask you this since you are such an Animal Crossing fan. Do you think. Don't die. Excuse me for animal still getting over a cold. Do you think for Animal Crossing on the switch. Do you think Nintendo is just going to stick to that formula that's worked that they've kind of kept kept with all the other games.
1822000	1840000	Yeah makes it up. They've tried to do something different every time. What I would like to see for Animal Crossing switches for it to be a combination of all the previous ones. I want the town. I want the customizable little shopping area that you can make yourself like a new leaf.
1841000	1861000	New Leaf was really I think one of the best of the series. I also wouldn't mind seeing if they were going to say put a Nintendo games in there but not have them be any us have them be like a DLC sort of thing where you can buy like certain Nintendo arcade titles.
1862000	1875000	Why should I have to. I mean granted the DLC stuff but like if I'm paying for that online pass thing I already have the Nintendo titles that are part there. Why can't I just bring those in. Yeah incorporate then game and watch or something. Oh that'd be cool.
1876000	1900000	Yeah you find game and watch things. Yeah I'd like that. You know or I think like for some of the you remember how you could get the old Nintendo toys like the was the ultra the ultra stack or whatever that you can get those toys and actually be able to play with them or something or having learned how to put in you know and have it be like a Nintendo themed deck or something.
1900000	1914000	OK. Or you know have it. I just think that there are other things that they could do that there's been the potential to do and actually do it well. And on top of that why not even incorporate the board game.
1915000	1930000	You know what's that game that I bought and played like four times the Mass Effect. No the Nintendo the Animal Crossing amiibo one amiibo festival. Oh yeah yeah. And then have like you can have a job as a happy home designer.
1930000	1943000	Why not incorporate all of it together or have it like stream you're like take your saves or something and be able to sink it over to your switch and or your pocket camp integration.
1943000	1953000	OK. That'd be cool. That would be cool. And then you could do like the your pocket camp could be like your island. Yeah. Oh bringing back the island like that. I don't trust Nintendo to do online.
1953000	1960000	I was like I was like that'd be cool. We'll see. We're talking Nintendo here. I know all those expectations are down down.
1960000	1982000	But I mean those are things that I would love to see in an Animal Crossing. I think it would be a lot of fun. It would added especially then given. Sorry I'm dying to especially incorporating in just all the other things that they have out there all of their other tools that they brought in the previous animal crossings and then go back to
1982000	1994000	look on YouTube. There are things that didn't carry over into other animal crossings that I think they could look back to the past things that people loved and bring those in.
1994000	2006000	You know you could have more transitional seasons for example you could do you know a deep sea fishing rodeo I don't know because they love fishing and bug catching and shit.
2006000	2016000	I just hope online's a little more seamless as opposed to having to go open the gate and close the gate. I want to go hit the citizens in Dark Soccer's town with a bug net whenever I want just bad luck.
2016000	2025000	So anyway all right. By the way I had a heart attack because I thought Ed had shown up in pocket camp. But no he's a unicorn and he's fine. His name is Julian.
2025000	2035000	Ed is Dark Soccer's least favorite animal to have ever crossed. And I want my lesbian back. Dina. Dina who is the gym teacher. All right look.
2035000	2048000	Enough Animal Crossing for now. Here's what we're going to. So one week from tonight OLR will be back at our usual time six o'clock Pacific nine o'clock Eastern. Here's the thing. In years past we have paused the show for Bethesda's press conference.
2048000	2061000	However this year they've changed the time so that they are starting at five thirty and assumably going to about six thirty or seven. We don't know. I'm making a judgment call this year we're not going to stop the show for Bethesda's conference because we know we're not getting starfield.
2061000	2072000	We know we're not getting Elder Scrolls six. And that's not to knock the things that we are going to hear about. But I think there are things that we can kind of you know Loki's looking at all sorts of things that laptop. I'm sure he'll have Bethesda's thing.
2073000	2089000	If there's something we need to know about he can pipe in as the show is going. But otherwise I think we're going to just do a normal show next week. But here's the other thing. This time next week we will know Microsoft's mysteries. We will know these 14 games because Microsoft is going earlier in the day they're going in the afternoon.
2089000	2099000	I will not know because I know I will be here. I won't know until the show because I'm going to be working pride. Oh that's right. SAC Pride.
2099000	2109000	Pride is it's Saturday and Sunday and the sisters are working with talent. OK. So so next week we'll get to say hi to Lizzo for you.
2109000	2123000	I love Lizzo. Anyway next week I will we'll get to play a fun game here in studio called tell Jamie what she missed at E3 and we'll gauge her reaction. Maybe if I have time I'll try to put together a little slide show and we can put things up on the TV.
2123000	2135000	Maybe I'll show up in face. I don't want to come up here and I'll be wiping the face off when I come here. It'll be Jamie with like no makeup and white streaks all over from my back in the chair and they can hardly see you anyway.
2135000	2157000	I'll go on cam if I'm in face. All right. I'll show people what a sister looks like. You know what a sister of perpetual indulgence looks like. Anyway. So yeah. Next week business as usual as far as our schedule. I've talked to Bobby Black Wolf. He was thinking he's not going to. He's business as usual for Bobby as well. So we will update you on Bethesda what's going on there as the night goes on.
2157000	2180000	But I'm not expecting none of us are expecting anything where we're going to suddenly just stop the show and go Oh my God out of Bethesda. So yeah. My expectations are very high there. I mean not and not to poop with their offerings. I'm sure there's going to be a new Elder Scrolls Online expansion. That's great for the fans of that game. There's probably going to be with the Wolfenstein Wolfenstein will be something something for Fallout 76.
2180000	2207000	You know something to fall out. I could see a new Vegas remastered or like Oblivion remaster or something like that. But like I mean I am not expecting anything new. Like I don't know. So what we won't know this time next week we will not know Nintendo's offerings. They are not going until they don't go till Tuesday morning right. Yeah. Monday was always the Sony day which is Ubisoft still doing there.
2207000	2221000	I believe Ubisoft is Monday morning and squares where it's going to take any spot Monday night. The only other person on Saturday EA will have gone. So if there is a Dragon Age thing for Jamie we'll know that on Saturday.
2221000	2231000	Oh if there's a Dragon Age thing though I will be looking for that because I want to punch soulless in his face. Yeah. So that's really what issue we call Dragon Age 4 punch soulless in the face.
2231000	2243000	All right. So that's that's where E3 is at. So E3 hysteria will be underway one week from tonight. We'll at least be able to recap Microsoft kind of Bethesda as it's going on and Bobby clarifies Ubisoft set Monday at 1 p.m. OK.
2243000	2256000	That's what. So I'll be watching that work. Who was always Monday morning was Ubisoft the first thing on Mondays. No it was. Yeah they were kind of pretty early in the morning I think. And then EA used to go on Mondays too.
2257000	2271000	Sometimes. Yeah it was like during the day I think. Yeah I feel like at one point I felt like Microsoft was the first thing Monday morning I think a couple of years ago they moved back to some Bobby says in chat that squinting is Monday at 6 p.m.
2271000	2286000	OK. Nintendo's Tuesday at 9 a.m. is Saturday at 915 a.m. OK. That's all kind of what I was thinking actually. So yeah I just I always thought there was another oh the P.C. show. That's a Monday thing in it. Are they not doing it. They're doing it this year.
2286000	2296000	Yeah. But we don't. I mean have we ever gotten anything that made us scream out of the. No no. But when's the Volvers. When's Devolver Digital.
2296000	2312000	Devolver is at the end of our I believe they're Sunday night towards the end of OLR. OK. Yeah. So that's really where it's at. All right. Yeah. Bobby clarify Sunday 7 p.m. So all right. Thank you. Bobby's given us all the updates in chat. This is this is a Bob. Bobby's the manager here.
2312000	2329000	Yeah. It looks like P.C. game shows in the morning. All right. OK. So the P.C. game show I think took a space that we used to be something else. But anyway we'll we'll deal with all that. So we'll talk about E3 and what's going on next week here on the show and of course reacting with you guys here.
2330000	2345000	What I haven't talked to Bobby about so. So Bobby and I both have day jobs as well as you know everybody else here in studio. So we can't really do like a live thing for Nintendo although I believe some folks will be gathering here in the chat room and we'll be hosting Nintendo's thing.
2345000	2361000	But for Square Enix we might be able to do something. So I'll talk to Bobby about that later if maybe we want to do a video thing during Square Enix and and do that. That thing which I usually don't like where people talk over the press conference and all that stuff.
2361000	2377000	But I think I think we can put our own spin on it and not have it be so irritating. I'll never forget the year I found. Oh finally somebody is streaming the Nintendo thing and it's just some guy going this looks like shit. Fucking Nintendo would need to put all this shitty stuff.
2377000	2384000	And I'm just like oh my God delete your account. Like why are you streaming if all you're going to talk is shit about this. Anyway.
2384000	2392000	S2100 Matt says a post show sass fest. Maybe something like that. But a little but but sass like like the good kind of sass.
2392000	2412000	So the sass and Creed sass and Creed sassy screen. Thanks I hate it. All right. Let's move on that you know I'm fabulous here. Let's get into our gaming week and the types of video games that we have been playing this week.
2413000	2422000	Dark Sakura how was your gaming week. Did you get to play some games on your trip. Well it's been two weeks. Maybe I did some ingress I did some Pokemon. I did a lot of Pokemon go actually.
2422000	2428000	And of course you know Animal Crossing pocket camp. You know it's all just stuff I had on my phone.
2428000	2442000	I don't really get to do any like constantly things although Dan and I we've been working you know trying to get this stuff together to do our stream but we have to get the this thing set up on our CRT and we just read it our office.
2442000	2453000	So we're debating if it's going to be Symphony of the night. But I kind of want to do the Saturn version so I can just play through the whole thing as Maria.
2453000	2464000	Or you know we were thinking of a link to the past. So we haven't decided. I'm thinking I'm leaning toward Castlevania I've been watching a stream of it and I was like fuck I love this game.
2464000	2477000	Why is this bitch using the heavenly sword and not getting the yes it sooner which is the best fucking weapon in the game. You get that and two rings of Varda. You are a whiz.
2477000	2483000	No one can stop you. Have you picked up the Castlevania collection. No you should.
2483000	2496000	It's fun. I don't know. I know. I mean we've already got all of those games on other things. Yes it's sort of like what's the point. I guess that's true. I'm looking forward to the Japanese update that's going to let me play like the Famicom version of Castlevania 3.
2496000	2505000	That'll be cool. That would make it worthwhile because we were even talking about that that you know when you go to fight in Symphony of the night when you go to fight.
2505000	2522000	Grant and Saifa and Trevor Grant can throw his his knives whereas in the US one in Castlevania 3 you could throw them in Castlevania 3 the Japanese one but in the US one it was stabby stab.
2523000	2532000	Quest busters reminded me in chat that a blood stained is happening this month. I forgot about that. Blood stained is happening. Exciting. And that will be stellar.
2532000	2544000	Anything else for you Dark Sakura. Let's go to Loki. How was your gaming week. I played a little bit of Dance Dance Revolution this week and been trying to get back into that again.
2544000	2559000	And I also did bust out a little bit on the Oculus Rift. So I played I tried Minecraft in VR. It was all right. It was neat. Just messing around and creative in that.
2559000	2578000	I didn't like the one thing I didn't like about it though is I was trying to use the crossbow and wherever you would think intuitively that like wherever you're pointing is where you should be aiming the arrow but it was like aiming it like where I was looking sort of but not quite.
2579000	2594000	And so you can never really hit anything with it which is kind of annoying. And then I tried the they have this like free like VR experiencing for Coco. So I tried that and I couldn't figure out what he wanted me to do.
2594000	2603000	It's like go on stage. I'm like OK I don't know how to get there. And like that like I was walking around doing all the crap that they wanted me to do and I couldn't fucking figure it out.
2603000	2617000	So I deleted it because this is stupid. And then what else. A little bit of vacation simulator. I'm playing that. It's not as fun as job simulator unfortunately. That's the bad thing.
2618000	2632000	But it's all right. And then. Yeah that's pretty much it. All right. My gaming week. So I talked about my weekend in Chicago and all that anger stuff so that was that barely touched Pokemon Go as a result.
2632000	2642000	But that's OK. I kind of need something really to excite me about Pokemon Go again and these raids are do I mean I did I did I will say I did one Pokemon raid in Chicago.
2642000	2653000	Some site some type of Abraham Lincoln statue. We were walking around this park one day. I was actually with Misty or she met us in Chicago and hung out with us for a little bit one day and we did a Pokemon raid at some at Lincoln Park.
2653000	2662000	We did a statue raid and that as Zell for whatever it is I didn't catch it. I was frustrated. This is probably the one time I'm going to get to raid this thing and there it goes.
2662000	2668000	But hopefully somebody will take pity on me and train me one. We'll see. But otherwise that's that's really it for that game.
2668000	2674000	So I've been playing a little bit of the Castlevania collection on PlayStation 4 because I picked that up right when it came out.
2674000	2682000	I've also been playing a little more Final Fantasy 14. There's an interesting event going on right now which encourages you to do some of the older content.
2682000	2694000	It's probably to help get people in the queues for that old content to help everybody get caught up for the new expansion that's coming out of the end of month which by the way I would bet that Microsoft getting Final Fantasy 14.
2694000	2702000	That seems like that's got to happen sooner rather than later. It seems weird that they still don't have it especially now in this era of like cross play is not really an issue anymore.
2702000	2710000	Everybody's kind of let down their guard on that. Like I don't know what's holding back on Final Fantasy 14 and Xbox One. So I would think that's going to be a thing that happens.
2710000	2718000	But anyway I've been playing a lot of Diablo 3 as well. I usually there's one Blizzard game I'll start playing the shit out of for a month or so.
2718000	2726000	And I was starting it the last time we talked but without a power level I got all the way to 70 and I think I'm paragon 50 now.
2726000	2736000	And I just cleared my level 20 greater rift so I can get my six piece set in Diablo 3. For those that play the game and understand exactly what I just said. I just did all that stuff.
2736000	2745000	So I've been having fun with that. While I was on my flight I enjoyed the classic NES library because you know once you check in online it's good for seven days.
2745000	2754000	So I was able to play on the plane so I was playing I was playing Super Mario 2 quite a bit. That's kind of like my go to NES game that I'll do a play through every few months or so.
2754000	2760000	Like let's go kick warts ass because it only takes about not even an hour to get through. It's a pretty fast game if you use all the warp zones.
2760000	2767000	So I played a little bit of that on the plane and I was playing some other Switch games too. So I played Tetris 99 offline.
2767000	2777000	You can do that with the new big piece DLC or whatever it is that they released. So I was able to play that on the plane a little bit against computer opponents.
2777000	2789000	And I can win when it's the computer. So that made me feel really good. I won a match on that. So that was pretty exciting. Otherwise that was pretty much my gamer week. So there's that.
2789000	2801000	So yeah. Looking in chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network. Run Jump Stomp I believe this comment is about Final Fantasy 14 saying the thing that's holding its back is Sony I'm sure.
2801000	2811000	But this time unlike Final Fantasy 11 when Play Online was kind of like a joint venture between Sony and Square. Sony doesn't really have a thing with Final Fantasy 14.
2811000	2825000	I mean because Sony excuse me Final Fantasy 14 was always playable with the console PlayStation and PC. Sony never had a problem with that end of it probably because they know it's like more like an MMO and this is what Square wants to do.
2825000	2836000	It seemed like Microsoft when 14 was being developed was the holdout. But you know 14 started development six seven years ago and I just think the cross play rules have changed a lot.
2836000	2844000	I kind of don't think I guess that's my really long winded way of saying when it comes to Final Fantasy 14 specifically that game I don't think it matters what Sony wants.
2844000	2854000	I think Square already has the buy in for Sony to do cross play on that because 14 has always supported the PC and the PlayStation at least since Realm Reborn.
2854000	2860000	1.0 was garbage and wasn't even on the PlayStation 3 or 4. But ever since Realm Reborn.
2860000	2868000	Let's see I guess that's it. That's it for my gaming week. Let's get into some gaming news shall we?
2868000	2879000	Yes. All right. So this is a pretty what the stream accidentally cut out because my fat finger hit the wrong button.
2879000	2886000	And so we're having an issue where the stream is cut out and it is completely my fault and I'm going to hope we're back online shortly.
2886000	2892000	But go ahead and start the next story for us Loki. All right. So this is pretty exciting.
2892000	2904000	But apparently they're going to be bringing the bringing Xbox Game Pass to PC finally because I've been asking for this to happen for the longest time.
2904000	2911000	So that's pretty cool. So what they're going to be doing is a little bit different than how it's working on the Xbox One.
2911000	2918000	But there'll be I guess 100 games which will be playable on many of which are on Xbox One.
2918000	2926000	But of those also a lot of them are going to be these Universal Windows apps that will support different Windows 32 applications.
2926000	2930000	And they're going to have other third party games in there as well.
2930000	2937000	So like from Deep Silver, Sega, Devolver Digital, Paradox, Bethesda, that type of stuff.
2937000	2944000	And I'm going to stop you right there for just a minute because we're going to do just a quick little thing here that I'm going to have to edit in post-production to try to fix our stream tonight.
2944000	2948000	But we will be right back. So after a little tech fail, we are back.
2948000	2951000	Yes. So lots of different third party publishers.
2951000	2957000	And of course, you know, just like the Xbox One, you're also going to get the day and date stuff like the brand new games.
2957000	2962000	Gears of War five. They mentioned the Age of Empires one through three definitive editions.
2962000	2967000	They're also going to be getting in the Master Chief collection on PC.
2967000	2973000	And then I would assume, you know, whatever new games they announced this year, those are going to probably be day and date with this stuff.
2973000	2980000	So I don't know. It sounds pretty awesome. I don't know when this is going into effect, but I guess we're supposed to learn more about it.
2980000	2983000	Probably during E3. So in like a week or so.
2983000	2988000	That would be a very logical time for them to explain everything about this on the PC.
2988000	2995000	So I'd be curious. But I mean, that sounds like a good deal to me. It sounds like a good deal was on on the Xbox One.
2995000	3000000	I just on Xbox One. So I was like, I'd do it if it was on PC.
3000000	3006000	Well, now it is. I think. Yeah, I I'm I'm excited to see what it is on PC.
3006000	3011000	I'm I would probably pick this up if I can do it on PC. I would love one that's both.
3011000	3016000	Do you think it'll be both where if I pay once I can get it on both sides? Because that would be amazing.
3016000	3020000	I think there's different things on the PC one, so maybe they will.
3020000	3026000	But or maybe if you like to subscribe to it, you get this on PC and this on the Xbox. I don't know.
3026000	3031000	I'd be OK with that. I guess we'll find out. Yes. We stay tuned for the press conference.
3031000	3038000	All right. Sounds good. Moving on to a story over on the Nintendo Switch and Super Mario Maker 2.
3038000	3042000	So some more details came out on Super Mario Maker 2. Some of them good, some of them not so good.
3042000	3048000	So let's start with the bad news, because this was all over Twitter and had a lot of people going WTF, Nintendo.
3048000	3056000	Give me a break. Super Mario Maker 2 will limit the online multiplayer to random players only.
3056000	3060000	You can still play with your friends if you play local wireless play.
3060000	3066000	But a Nintendo representative explained Nintendo's reasoning is that with global leaderboards,
3066000	3070000	the matchmaking for a competitive play would be compromised if you could play with friends.
3070000	3076000	That limitation also extends to co-op play as well, despite those not being leaderboard driven.
3076000	3085000	So they couldn't have just if you're playing with friends, have maybe just not put those on leaderboards or will pop up that says no one has friends.
3085000	3090000	Rob, here's here's the thing is like the local the local play that they have is unranked anyway.
3090000	3096000	So you couldn't put unranked in multiplayer as well online.
3096000	3099000	I know it's it's I don't get it.
3099000	3106000	It's it's because I know it's because we just don't want to build matchmaking servers is what we don't want to do.
3106000	3114000	And so we're just going randomly. But but then again, I guess you can play Mario Kart with your friends and you can do Splatoon with your.
3114000	3117000	Does it make sense? Although you couldn't at first, but there's.
3117000	3121000	Well, here's the thing, though, like they're trying to like solve a problem that's not even there yet.
3121000	3128000	And like you would like I think they did something similar, like Splatoon 2, where they tried to like limit you in certain ways that you can play on there.
3128000	3133000	But it still didn't stop the people from hacking the game and cheating like crazy.
3133000	3141000	It's not going to stop it here in Mario Maker either. It's just going to be people are doing it in other ways and not necessarily playing your friends to exploit stuff.
3141000	3145000	I just think it's you're trying to solve for a problem that's not even a problem yet.
3145000	3160000	And on top of that, hopefully there won't be any like related voice business with any of it, because I'm sure as many other people of the female persuasion know online play is a very toxic environment.
3160000	3168000	Well, even if there was Nintendo, you have to jump through loopholes by using their app to get voice chat anyway, which most people don't bother with.
3168000	3177000	So it's kind of assumed that most people aren't using voice chat. Most people that game on the Switch with their friends and the game and the games allow you to do that, just use Discord or something or a Skype call or something.
3177000	3181000	Right, which is but if you won't be able to play with your friends.
3181000	3185000	Yeah, it's an it's again putting someone into a toxic environment.
3185000	3190000	Oh, yeah. And I wouldn't I would never use voice chat with playing with randos and I'm probably not going to use the feature to play with randos.
3190000	3207000	It's not really something I'm interested in doing. But like I was really excited about the potential of going live on Twitch and doing a co stream with Bobby or Delvin or one of my streaming friends, and we could stream a level on Mario maker together.
3207000	3218000	And that would have been really fun. But now we can't do that because this design is stupid. So I'm hoping it's one of those things that they're going to fix pretty quickly out the gate.
3218000	3224000	You know, to be fair, again, I don't think Splatoon had it right away and they ended up building it in. So maybe the same.
3224000	3229000	You can always add it later and be like, we listen to you. We listen to you.
3229000	3234000	Part of our roadmap all along. Yes. Anyway, so maybe some good news.
3234000	3238000	The roadmap to help. Some good news. You know, I said the bad news. Here's some good news.
3238000	3244000	So all the building features in Super Mario Maker 2 are unlocked from the start.
3244000	3249000	So you don't have to actually unlock things as you go or anything like that.
3249000	3253000	The level builder will have all of the features unlocked from the start. So you don't have to worry.
3253000	3257000	You know, even though there's like a single player mode or you're rebuilding the castles, nothing's going to be locked.
3257000	3262000	Yeah, that kind of sucked the first time or any other kind of like time jump and stuff in order to unlock things.
3262000	3268000	So that's that's some good news, I guess, to kind of, you know, say say something good to go with the bad.
3268000	3272000	I haven't now what I haven't heard is is all that amiibo stuff coming back?
3272000	3277000	I don't think so. Oh, that's a bummer. I kind of like that. Yeah, I don't think there's any amiibo support whatsoever.
3277000	3281000	Oh, no. Where you can get all the different Mario skins. No, I don't think that they have that.
3281000	3288000	Oh, that's kind of that's sad. I'm not kind of like I understand that people are not crazy about amiibo, but I was cool.
3288000	3297000	You could do and it wasn't all amiibo either. There was like competitions online that you would if you cleared a certain map, you would unlock a skin that you could.
3297000	3302000	Yeah, I like that stuff. I'm kind of I'm pretty sure I read that it's not.
3302000	3306000	Yeah. Chatters chatters are echoing that, saying no amiibo support amiibo are done.
3306000	3309000	Why? I don't know. Amiibo is not done. They're still putting out the new smash ones.
3309000	3320000	They just they just put one out. Was it that they're afraid that someone's going to find like, I don't know, like hack an update or something like that and spoil the surprise of new amiibo?
3320000	3325000	I don't know. It seems like a reach. I just I liked that you could have all those.
3325000	3329000	You would think they already put it in there for the first game, at least support the same.
3329000	3335000	Oh, whatever. Maybe maybe it has something to do with not wanting to do the skins for other configurations.
3335000	3341000	But it was always only the retro anyway. You couldn't play those those different like skins. They were only for the eight bit Mario.
3341000	3346000	Well, yeah. And on top of that, you know, too, they also have that preorder bonus.
3346000	3352000	It's only in Europe now, which doesn't make any sense either. There's a lot of weird stuff with Mario maker right now.
3352000	3357000	So I hope Nintendo kind of gets on the right path and gets that all figured out because this game's out of the we're in June now.
3357000	3361000	Right. This game's out at the end of the month because it's coming out for my birthday.
3361000	3367000	So I'm excited about that. So. All right. Well, there you go. Super Mario maker to Dark Sakura.
3367000	3375000	What do you have for us? I have naps, lots and lots of naps and some disappointment.
3375000	3381000	Pokemon sleep. Have you heard of it? It's what the opposite of go is.
3381000	3386000	It helps you level your pokey man's while you sleep in. It's a sleep monitor.
3386000	3392000	Pokemon, go take a nap. Yeah. Pokemon, go take a nap. Pokemon, go to bed. I wanna.
3392000	3399000	And of course, that's why we have all the Snorlax's sees all over the place because of sleep.
3399000	3407000	But, you know, they missed an opportunity because they have a sleeping Pikachu and it should have fucking been Jigglypuff with a mic singing you the fuck to sleep.
3407000	3414000	It's set to come out in 2020 and it's going to work with a little thing called the Pokemon go plus plus.
3414000	3425000	That's the name of it. The good Pokemon go plus plus. Which will have a sleeping tracker, which you would then put by your pillow for it to monitor your sleeping.
3425000	3435000	I'm pretty sure that since the Pokemon go app works on Apple Watch for now, that's coming up later in the show.
3435000	3447000	That hopefully they would see the well, maybe value of partnering since adventure sync is a thing in Pokemon go using your watch data to walk your Pokemon.
3447000	3453000	Maybe it will use your watch data or whatever. We keep saying Apple Watch because Jamie and I are Apple people, but I know you're a Fitbit guy.
3453000	3455000	Same thing, right?
3455000	3457000	I have a workaround, but it works with adventure sync.
3457000	3464000	It's the same thing. Maybe the Fitbit. Just Fitbit monitor your sleep. Does it have a little light to do heart rate and all that stuff?
3464000	3467000	Yes, if I wear this at night it will monitor my sleep.
3467000	3480000	I use this to monitor my sleep. I charge my watch and I'm in the shower and I charge it because we all know that when you go to bed, you're really lying in bed playing on your phone for 30 more minutes.
3480000	3487000	So I will charge my watch while I'm in bed, but not in bed yet. That's enough to get my watch through the day.
3487000	3491000	I let it actually monitor my sleep and it's very interesting.
3491000	3497000	Yesterday, I didn't talk about this, but I also went to an Ingress thing yesterday called First Saturday and I walked a lot yesterday.
3497000	3503000	I walked like five miles and I was doing a lot of micro-fielding and stuff and I got my heart rate up.
3503000	3507000	So when I slept last night, my heart rate decreased by 28%, which is really good.
3507000	3510000	So that's something that my sleep monitor kind of tells me.
3510000	3513000	It's interesting. It's not life-changing, but it's interesting.
3513000	3521000	If I didn't have to sleep with a brace on my left wrist, which is the wrist I wear my watch on, I might give that a try.
3521000	3530000	So no guarantee that watches or Fitbits or any of it are going to work.
3530000	3540000	It's still stupid though that I should buy another app. Even if, let's just say, I have a Gotcha, but I don't have the Pokemon Go Plus or whatever.
3540000	3543000	But now I have to buy another one to use this?
3543000	3545000	Yeah, it's going to be like $35.
3545000	3550000	So no, that's not going to happen. And it better work on my watch.
3550000	3554000	Yeah, I'm interested if it works on my watch. I'm not if I have to buy yet another accessory.
3554000	3558000	And how's it supposed to work anyways? You're not even wearing it.
3559000	3566000	Well, as I was going to say, it actually is being developed by Select Button that worked on Magikarp Jump.
3566000	3576000	And basically it's supposed to, you connect it to your phone, for the Go Plus Plus anyway, to send your sleep data as you sleep wearing it.
3576000	3579000	Although it said something about like putting it beside your pillow as well.
3579000	3583000	That's what I'm deaf saying in chat. It isn't one that you wear, you put it by your pillow.
3583000	3584000	How the hell does that work?
3584000	3586000	There are sleep monitors that work under your pillow.
3586000	3592000	And Bobby is mentioning something about that he has a sleep monitor in the bed. So I'm sure there's like mattresses that do that too.
3592000	3593000	Smart mattresses?
3593000	3594000	Yeah, something like that.
3594000	3595000	Yeah, I know.
3595000	3596000	That's scary.
3596000	3597000	I'm sure it's a thing.
3597000	3607000	No, there are. It was called like Bedom or something or bed something that was a smart mattress to monitor your sleep.
3607000	3611000	We detected sex. We're going to add it to your exercise for the day.
3611000	3615000	Bobby in chat says sleep IQ is what they call it on sleep number beds.
3615000	3623000	Yeah, but on top of that, there are monitors that you put under your pillow that actually track your movement in your sleep.
3623000	3632000	Like how often you're moving around. If you fall into REM sleep, you don't move ideally unless you're just, you know, an active sleeper.
3632000	3638000	We've detected only half the weight in the bed tonight. Did you make your husband sleep on the couch? Yes or no?
3639000	3650000	At any rate, it's interesting. I'm probably going to give it a try. Okay, so yeah, this thing is it's actually 40 bucks, I think, for the for the thing.
3650000	3652000	I'm hating it more and more, Jamie.
3652000	3671000	And then, yeah, and of course, then they also talked about, you know, bringing out Switch games, but they said something about a cloud based service called Pokemon Home that lets you link your phone and your Switch so that you can do your Pokemon together.
3671000	3680000	Huh? I wonder if we didn't put enough about it here. We have a Pokemon direct on Jenny coming up in this next week, I think just before E3.
3680000	3684000	So that's another thing that we'll be talking about next week's show is that we'll know a little more on Pokemon Gen 8.
3684000	3690000	And maybe when they talk a little more about Pokemon Sword Shield, they might explain that a little better than they have. Don't forget about Pokemon gun.
3692000	3698000	I'm still waiting for Pokemon gun. Here's the thing. Act F in chat says 40 US dollars doesn't seem that bad. You're right.
3698000	3704000	But here's here's the problem I'm having. So we had the Pokemon Go Plus the first year. Do you have any tacos that would be?
3704000	3713000	Then last year it was the Pokemon Go Ball. The Ball Plus. The Ball Plus. And now it's a Pokemon Go Plus. I'm sorry. No, no, we're done with hardware.
3713000	3724000	Exactly. I bought the Ball Plus thing just to play around with that one game and I've used it before as a Pokemon Go Plus type thing.
3724000	3731000	I have a Gotcha. I'm not buying another piece of hardware because I already have some of the monitors, but I don't need to wear two things.
3731000	3738000	She doesn't have any of that shit. I won't blame Nintendo for the Gotcha because that is a third party device that they probably don't like. Let's be real.
3738000	3746000	I'm not going to count the Gotcha against them. But you know, the reality is I'm just I'm not interested in another piece of Pokemon hardware for this.
3746000	3751000	If it does something in addition with Gen 8 or something, maybe I'll revisit. I want the Eevee Tamagotchi.
3751000	3756000	But for now, I just think Pokemon Sleep ought to work with Watches and Fitbits.
3756000	3758000	I think it should.
3758000	3768000	An act-deaf confesses in chat, I'm a Poke Plus whore. Alright, well then that's all. You know what? From somebody who has bought Mass Effect 3 four times, I'm not going to criticize you. You do you, boo.
3768000	3777000	And also I have to see what exactly the advantages. How is this going to tie in with Pokemon Go? I mean, like what advantages are we getting for paying $40?
3777000	3780000	I'm going to wait for the IRL reviews.
3780000	3781000	Fair enough.
3781000	3786000	But I'm probably not going to get it because honestly, I don't fucking need it to enjoy my Pokemon games.
3786000	3795000	Fair. Alright, more to come probably next week after the big Pokemon Direct that we know is coming this week. So in the meantime, we will move on with another story. Loki.
3795000	3810000	So this is kind of neat. Google is basically putting out new Play Store policies requiring game developers to show players what the chances are of getting items contained in loot boxes.
3810000	3828000	In random loot boxes, I should say. And part of this, I guess, it says that apps offering mechanisms to receive randomized virtual items from a purchase, i.e. loot box, must clearly disclose the odds of receiving those items in advance of purchase.
3829000	3842000	So apparently, Apple has similar rules already for at least a few years. But it's interesting to see that this is something that is being forced on multiple's friends now.
3842000	3850000	Which is good because they also have legislation going in that's supposed to remove these types of microtransactions as well.
3850000	3865000	So yeah, it'll be interesting to see what effect this has on mobile games. Because there's a lot, Jesus Christ, tons of mobile games with loot boxes. So we'll see what this does.
3866000	3879000	There's a lot, but I will give Google credit here because I believe it was on the last episode, or the one before, we were talking about how the US Senate or House is looking to step in and regulate this.
3879000	3890000	And I said, it is up to Nintendo, Sony, and the ones that run the store. It is up to them at this point to solve this problem, or the problem will be solved for them.
3890000	3899000	So I will give Google this. They are trying to solve the problem. So I'm going to give polite applause. It's very polite so you might not be able to hear it.
3899000	3911000	But I'm giving polite applause to Google because this is the direction we have to move in, or the government is going to try to solve it. We don't. This government doesn't solve problems. They create problems. We know that.
3911000	3923000	So this is a good thing. And you're right. There's a lot of stuff on mobile that does. Now I don't think this can be the only thing that we do. And obviously the other consoles have to figure something out here.
3923000	3938000	But this is a good step by Google. And we have a big Apple event coming next week as well. We're starting to get rumors about iTunes might be replaced. There's other stuff we're hearing out of Apple. Maybe Apple could do a similar thing.
3939000	3941000	Thank God. I hope it happens.
3941000	3946000	Apple could go a similar direction. They may announce this at the developers conference. We'll see.
3946000	3947000	I can see.
3947000	3949000	We need to get an update on this Apple Arcade and all that.
3949000	3960000	Yeah, the Arcade stuff. Definitely. As far as the loot box stuff, Apple's had this in place since 2017. So they've had that restriction. I'm curious to see so many announcements.
3960000	3982000	SSJ 100 Matt in chat says EA has to get on board. They're the problem. I agree with you to an extent SSJ. But consider this. They actually don't have to get on board. Not after what Google just did. So guess what? As far as Android devices are concerned at this point, EA is now on board. Because Google changed it. Does that make sense?
3983000	3995000	So if PlayStation, Apple, Nintendo, if everybody follows. Well, I'm just saying as far as like the odds, one part of it. I'm not saying the problem's gone. Yay. But this one part of it that could go a long way.
3995000	4015000	Well, yeah. In order to be on the Play Store, they have to do that. But then again, you know, you have games like Fortnite and stuff. They have their own launchers that you do it externally. So EA could just sidestep the whole store, put out their own store that you download through the Play Store and then or even externally and then sell their games through that.
4015000	4024000	And not have to abide by that. But then that would also look kind of shady. Yeah. It'd be like, well, why aren't you disclosing these odds? Because we're assholes.
4025000	4040000	Some comments in chat about the Apple stuff. Act F says that Apple conference is going to be quite interesting. Bobby, at least it's not the same app. I remember quite often Apple and E3 would be the same week. So that's not happening this time. Apple's next week and then E3 is the week after. So at least we get a reprieve there.
4040000	4053000	Bobby Black Wolf says, I'm going to miss my iTunes library. Sad face. The one Apple product I use is getting killed. I would think and maybe I don't know if you're saying this in cheek, but I thought it was very obvious that like because everything's in the cloud and Apple knows what you own.
4053000	4059000	Like whenever they have a new music app or whatever, whatever. Obviously, they're not just killing iTunes. That's something to replace it. So whatever.
4060000	4073000	Sorry, we got nothing. I'm going to tell you this right now, because, yeah, on the phones, there is the music app. Yeah. There there's a separate TV app. There's a podcast app. There's a podcast app. And I like having them separated.
4073000	4087000	And you and it already knows, like the TV app says, oh, you've bought these TV shows. And if you don't like it, apple.com slash feedback. All your stuff is in the cloud. So it's I don't think you're going to lose anything, but it is going to be a little weird.
4088000	4100000	I will say this. For this very show, Orange Launch Radio, I do all the MP3 tagging and the artwork loading in iTunes. So I'm just going to hope that the standalone music app is just basically iTunes.
4100000	4109000	So I can continue to kind of do that. Because or I guess I have to figure out how to do it a win app or something else. So yeah, I'm sure I'm sure it'll be fine, though. I'm not too worried about it.
4110000	4117000	All right. I'm just going to say this. I wouldn't be surprised if some of this goes through the same stuff that goes for book publishing.
4117000	4124000	For the self-published through Apple Books. I wouldn't be at all surprised if it goes through the same publishing channels.
4124000	4138000	Bobby Blackwell says most of my iTunes library is ripped CDs, so they don't know. OK, I see what you're saying. But I can't imagine they're just you're not going to just drive unless you have iTunes match or you just drag and drop into the music app.
4138000	4146000	I doubt they're going to make it that they would know that they're going to get pushback from music lovers that if suddenly the MP3s you created don't work.
4146000	4153000	I'm sure it'll be easy. I'm not too worried about it. Well, and on top of that, there's also GarageBand is free.
4153000	4160000	Oh, does GarageBand have like a music library in it? No, but you can you can rip CD. Yeah, but you don't want to do it again if you've ripped like five.
4160000	4168000	No, I'm saying you can. Your MP3s aren't going to go anywhere. They're still going to be physically on your computer unless you're using iTunes match and put it in the cloud yourself.
4168000	4176000	Got it. What I'm saying is that you can bring in your own MP3s still in GarageBand to convert them for other purposes.
4176000	4183000	Got it. OK. All right. All right. Well, let's move on. We know we went from Google all around all around the bed.
4183000	4188000	We got an update this week on Death Stranding, a pretty big update, in fact, one that might have surprised some people.
4188000	4195000	Guess what, y'all? Death Stranding is coming out this year. It's a 2019 game. How about that? I still don't know what it's about.
4195000	4202000	No, we still don't know what it's about. Babies in jars. And it's it does seem like there's this interesting thing where you don't ever die.
4202000	4210000	You go to the upside down, which sounds a lot to me like the first version of Prey. Remember Prey the shooter?
4210000	4217000	Not the recent, but back when it was more like an ID game and the first time they did Prey, you never died.
4217000	4223000	You went to this like spirit world where you had to like get enough birds and then you went back to and reincarnated.
4223000	4229000	It is, though. I mean, what if, though, this like whatever other world is, is it literally called the upside down? Because I don't.
4229000	4235000	I don't think. No, that's like that's a Stranger Things reference. I had a feeling because I was like, really?
4235000	4237000	Oh, sorry. Go ahead.
4237000	4245000	What I was going to say is that it makes me think, though, of very Silent Hill things where you had your, I guess, darker world that would come in.
4245000	4249000	So I think that's more of a nod back to its Silent Hill roots.
4250000	4255000	Well, to to that point, actually, I swear to God, in the trailer, they mentioned something about P.T.
4255000	4262000	So maybe, maybe I'm sure there were unused ideas that are going to show up in this Death Stranding.
4262000	4265000	It's been a few years, so it looks good.
4265000	4272000	I just don't know what the hell it's about. But did you see that collector's edition with the actual baby in the jar and all that?
4272000	4275000	Yes, with the actual baby. Life-size baby.
4275000	4282000	I don't think I want a baby in a jar. I don't want any babies in jars or outside of jars.
4282000	4286000	Yeah, I'm going to be passing. Babies are icky. I'm going to pass on that collector's edition as well.
4286000	4288000	Other people can have babies.
4288000	4290000	All right. Not this bitch.
4290000	4293000	What else can other people have? Dark Sakura, next up in news.
4293000	4297000	Ghosts. Ghost busters, what do you want?
4297000	4300000	That's the best line in that whole movie, by the way.
4300000	4306000	So yeah, after a decade, we are getting a remaster of Ghostbusters, the video game.
4306000	4315000	Which is, for all intents and purposes, the third Ghostbusters movie. The one they wanted to do, right?
4315000	4322000	And, I mean, it's got, of course, the, and they, of course, they recorded everything while everyone was still alive.
4323000	4333000	But, you know, it's got the original cast from the movie. It's got, it's just got a great story. It's a really great game.
4333000	4342000	And I'm really looking forward to having it, you know, and I'm really glad that it's, you know, a way to keep the franchise alive.
4342000	4351000	I mean, I'll be honest, I haven't seen the AU version with the female cast, which I should. I own a copy.
4352000	4357000	But, there's just something nostalgic for all of us who grew up with Ghostbusters.
4357000	4360000	You know, I've got laserdiscs of Ghostbusters 1 and 2.
4360000	4364000	And when that game came out, you better believe that we shot right out and got it.
4364000	4370000	I remember the first first Ghostbusters game on Commodore 64 and Atari 2600, and that game was fun.
4370000	4375000	And then there was a Ghostbusters 2 game, I remember, on early PCs, like with the VGA graphics, right?
4375000	4378000	It was pretty good, too. So the Ghostbusters games have always been pretty good.
4378000	4383000	But I also missed this remaster. You know, some folks in chat are kind of agreeing there.
4383000	4388000	Questbuster in chat says, it's literally the third movie. Jamie is spot on. Even Ackroyd pretty much said the same thing.
4388000	4395000	Exactly. What was, if I remember correctly, it was based on one of Ackroyd's screenplays that he had prepared for a third Ghostbusters movie.
4395000	4403000	So, I'm super, super thrilled. But at any rate, it's going to be out on the modern consoles.
4404000	4409000	And I'm just really, really, really, really looking forward to it.
4409000	4414000	But, I mean, it goes back into, you know, back to the Gozer storyline.
4414000	4419000	And, you know, Ivo Shandor, who was, you know, the main person that they were researching.
4419000	4424000	And it was just, you know, really such a great game.
4424000	4428000	And I'm super, super, super, super, super happy that it's coming out.
4428000	4432000	And I'm probably going to be getting this on PS4.
4432000	4436000	YYR is pointing out, worth a mention, if you have Xbox One, you don't need the remaster.
4436000	4439000	Just play the original via backwards compatibility. But, remember...
4439000	4440000	Don't have an Xbox One.
4440000	4446000	And remember a few weeks ago, they delisted the game, you know, actually probably a couple months ago at this point.
4446000	4450000	Now, granted, I'm sure you could find a disc at GameStop or on eBay or something like that.
4450000	4456000	In fact, now at GameStop on those used games for the Xbox 360, they do market if they're compatible with Xbox One on there.
4456000	4460000	Interesting. But I would think maybe it's going to drive up the price a little bit.
4460000	4465000	Probably not like sky high. But I imagine GameStop's going to know, like, oh, people are going to be suddenly interested in this.
4465000	4470000	Because, you know, I don't see it going sky high. It might go up from like five bucks to ten bucks.
4470000	4473000	But I'm sure, you know, there's probably still ways to find it.
4473000	4481000	Well, at any rate, I am super, super, super, super happy. Like, this is me going rawr.
4481000	4486000	Okay, awesome. All right, moving on. Loki, what do you have for us?
4486000	4494000	So, you may remember we talked about the Overwatch Workshop, which is a brand new thing that allows players to create their own custom game types and all sorts of weird things.
4494000	4502000	What is the most popular mods that are available for Overwatch? Well, the number one mod is UNO.
4502000	4507000	Yes, that's right, the card game. So you can actually play UNO in Overwatch now.
4508000	4522000	Some other notable mentions as well. The floor is lava parkour. They have McCree Hot Potato, Hammond Racing, Gun Game, which is, you know, I think from Call of Duty or Battlefield, one of those.
4522000	4532000	Diva Bumper Cart, Flappy Bird, and well, there's interesting stuff. They have a portal gun mode as well.
4532000	4539000	And even a Super Smash Brothers mode type that actually looks like Smash Brothers.
4539000	4543000	So pretty crazy all the stuff that is actually being created for this.
4543000	4551000	The UNO one, actually, people have spent, I guess, almost 1400 hours playing UNO Overwatch.
4551000	4557000	And I guess across, you know, they said it looks like 1500 matches.
4557000	4566000	And then, of course, the second one floor is lava parkour and McCree Hot Potato, 1246 in 1048 hours.
4566000	4570000	You know, I've been out of the loop on Overwatch, admittedly. I haven't really played a lot.
4570000	4573000	But this is definitely going to make me take another look.
4573000	4578000	And, you know, Blizzard's kind of done this sort of thing before. And, you know, Starcraft 2 was the game that they did.
4578000	4582000	They had that whole Starcraft 2 arcade. And it was a very similar thing. It was Starcraft Workshop.
4582000	4590000	And I loved, there was Star Jeweled, where you basically played Bejeweled, but it would cause a Starcraft match to kind of automate.
4590000	4596000	And they had another one called Iyer Chef, because Iyer is one of the races in Starcraft.
4596000	4600000	They had one where you had to go out and get ingredients and stuff. And it was fun.
4600000	4606000	And those two particular games were like official Blizzard arcade products.
4606000	4616000	And, you know, if you want to talk about modding and arcade stuff, heck, go all the way back to Warcraft 3 and this little mod called Defense of the Ancients, or Dota.
4616000	4626000	I mean, that started a whole other, that started the MOBA genre of games for which we have Heroes of the Storm, Dota 2, League of Legends.
4626000	4633000	You know, that all owes itself to something like this. So, who knows, maybe The Floor is Lava will be a next Valve acquisition.
4633000	4639000	And then they'll put out the second game, and then never a third game. That'll be the way it goes.
4639000	4643000	So, I'll check that out. It sounds good. Bobby Blackwolf says, this might get me to Overwatch.
4643000	4653000	Yeah, why not? I mean, in Overwatch, is it only 20 bucks now? Did they finally permanently put the price down? I don't know, or is it still like 50? I don't know.
4653000	4660000	Anyway, Act F says, they need to fix some of the stuff in the regular game. Cough, cough, better console support, and so forth.
4660000	4665000	Dark Tetsuya says, hashtag, The Floor is Lava 3 confirmed.
4666000	4670000	Bonds006 says, yes, the granddaddies are getting some shine, Dota.
4670000	4676000	Hey, well, yeah, with Warcraft 3 remastered, let's not forget, that's a Blizzard thing that they're working on.
4676000	4687000	So, it'll be interesting to see that original Dota getting remastered. I'm confident Blizzard has to be, like, not only are they thinking about the original Warcraft 3 game, that mod has got to be up and running day one.
4687000	4693000	They're going to have some type of official Dota mod for that day one, because that'll get people interested in Warcraft 3 right there, I'm sure.
4693000	4701000	So, anyway, moving on, we kind of referenced this a little bit earlier in the show, and it has to do with Pokemon Go and the Apple Watch.
4701000	4707000	And so, Dark Soccer, I'm sorry to say, Pokemon Go is dropping Apple Watch support after July 1st.
4707000	4714000	The reason why is that basically it's not useful anymore, because they built Adventure Sync into the game.
4714000	4719000	So, Adventure Sync kind of takes your steps and your buddy, Candy, and all that stuff and puts it in the game.
4719000	4726000	So, they felt that the Watch app was a little bit redundant and not worth them basically putting extra resources into. So, RIP.
4726000	4728000	Well, I liked it linking to my workouts.
4728000	4731000	Yeah, but I think Adventure Sync will also link to your workouts.
4731000	4737000	So, yeah, Adventure Sync will track data through fitness apps, including data sent from the Apple Watch.
4737000	4743000	So, that's that. So, basically, the Adventure Sync mode killed the Apple Watch support.
4743000	4753000	I think it is notable, though, that we're here because I feel like it was just two years ago at Apple's big event where they were talking about this on stage.
4753000	4760000	And so, now it's gone. And it's not, I mean, it's not like EA pulling online servers after only a year and a half.
4760000	4765000	I mean, they're pulling this because something a little more advanced replaced it. So, it's not that big a deal.
4765000	4770000	But it is just interesting how fast the technology moves, right? This is how fast technology moves.
4770000	4777000	What we were once shouting about on stage is, look at this cool new feature for the game that everybody's playing is now, oh, it's sunsetting because it's redundant.
4777000	4781000	That's how fast technology is moving. And I thought that made this very noteworthy.
4781000	4787000	So, from there, we'll take a trip back in time to the classic game of the week.
4787000	4795000	Every week here on the show, Dark Sakura takes a step back through space and time to find a game that she thinks, hey, you guys should be checking out this game this week.
4795000	4803000	But in a 2019 twist, once a month, she spotlights a game as a classic soundtrack of the month.
4803000	4810000	And just ironically with us being off last week, I believe the last show we had May's soundtrack of the month.
4810000	4815000	And now today we're getting June's soundtrack of the month. So, lots of soundtracks.
4815000	4818000	But a good choice tonight. I'm excited to hear more about this.
4818000	4821000	So, Dark Sakura, what is the classic soundtrack of the month?
4821000	4832000	The classic soundtrack of the month is actually R-Type for, and I actually picked two consoles for this because I thought, while I do think one is better than the other, the other one is fairly noteworthy for what it is.
4832000	4834000	We're going to start on Sega Master System.
4834000	4837000	So, Sega Master System, and this is specifically the FM soundtrack.
4837000	4847000	R-Type has an amazing soundtrack anyway. Everyone who has ever heard me talk about it knows that R-Type is one of my favorite pieces of music ever.
4847000	4853000	And I'm going to apologize. The audio is going to be a little low. And here in studio, you're not going to be able to hear it. It is going through on stream. I can see the bars.
4853000	4859000	But it is a little lower than usual. Sorry, that was just a my bad in the production. But you should be able to hear it if you listen carefully.
4859000	4865000	Well, at any rate, the music, at least for the arcade game, was done by Ishizaki Masato.
4865000	4871000	And I don't know if he did the SMS version.
4871000	4876000	But the Sega Master System version, and I've brought up the FM sound unit before.
4876000	4884000	With the FM sound unit, what it does is it enhances the sound output from certain of the Sega Mark III games.
4885000	4893000	It was a separate unit that was sold in Japan starting around 1987 for about 6800 yen.
4893000	4903000	And it used a YM2413 FM chip that would work on top of the built-in SN76489 PSG chip.
4903000	4906000	So it added 9 extra mono sound channels.
4906000	4912000	So of course you could get nearer arcade quality music out of the Sega Master System.
4912000	4920000	And it supported a good number of games too, including R-Type.
4920000	4929000	So the music, and I'll add this on here, you can get an FM power base converter.
4929000	4934000	If you've got a Sega Master System, that will also give you the FM output for this game.
4935000	4937000	But it's just super amazing.
4937000	4943000	And I'm not going to go into the gameplay of R-Type, because I've talked about R-Type ad nauseam.
4943000	4949000	But the music, I think for the type of game it was, was really unique.
4949000	4954000	Where you had your Gradius music that was all kind of upbeat and heroic.
4954000	4962000	You had this dark, gritty music that was mostly all in minor key.
4962000	4965000	And then when you beat your level, it goes into a major key.
4965000	4968000	And then goes right back into a minor key.
4968000	4970000	It really added to the excitement of the game.
4970000	4972000	Especially those boss battles.
4974000	4980000	Now, to add in another one that I was surprisingly happy with.
4980000	4982000	And you may be pleased with this.
4982000	4985000	The Commodore 64 version of the music.
4985000	4988000	And we actually have some B-roll of that.
4989000	4996000	And I don't think it's as great as the Sega Master System version, clearly.
4996000	5006000	But the instrumentation on this one with what the Commodore 64 could do was really good.
5006000	5010000	Yeah, if you were a fan of the SID chip on the 64, this is a really good use of it.
5010000	5013000	Like, obviously, see now I am more partial to this one.
5013000	5018000	But that's because I grew up with C64, I love C64 music.
5018000	5022000	So both Dark Soccer and I have these admitted biases tonight.
5022000	5024000	Well, and I didn't grow up with the Master System.
5024000	5026000	Yeah, but you became a Sega fan later, you know.
5026000	5034000	Yeah, but at any rate, though, I have to say that I had not given this version much thought.
5034000	5038000	Even though I know, playwise, it's a pretty good version of our type.
5038000	5042000	It's an impressive fucking feat for the Commodore 64 as well.
5042000	5044000	I don't think you see it in this early levels.
5044000	5047000	But in some of the later levels, when the background starts drawing in.
5047000	5049000	Oh, here we go. There we go.
5049000	5051000	So on the Twitch stream, you can actually see the background's drawing in.
5051000	5053000	And it's kind of moving at its own pace.
5053000	5058000	This is impressive for an early 80s computer.
5058000	5062000	And this was an 8-bit computer, if I recall, technically.
5062000	5064000	Yeah, the 64, yeah.
5064000	5068000	I mean, later on, you had the 128 that tried to up that.
5068000	5071000	But nothing ever matched the 64.
5071000	5074000	Right. And so I really, really...
5074000	5077000	And I was just sitting down listening to the music.
5077000	5080000	And I was like, damn, this is actually pretty good.
5080000	5085000	So I figured that I would add this one in as well.
5085000	5092000	Because it's the same game, but each of them showcase what their systems can do.
5092000	5097000	And I think because the Commodore 64 had its own chip with its own limitations,
5097000	5098000	it was kind of a regular thing.
5098000	5103000	This is not the only game that had an independent soundtrack for the Commodore 64 version.
5103000	5106000	The other big example I think of, which I think I picked as a classic game of the week,
5106000	5108000	one of the weeks you weren't here, about a year ago,
5108000	5110000	Bomb Jack is a great example of that.
5110000	5114000	You know, Bomb Jack had his own little song in the arcade and in some of the translations.
5114000	5120000	But for the Commodore 64 version, they took an actual 80s synth NeoWave song
5120000	5122000	and made it on the Commodore 64 version of that.
5122000	5131000	That whole thing, that was actually an 80s song that they kind of made the Bomb Jack song on 64.
5131000	5132000	It was really cool.
5132000	5136000	And for the record, I'm not including the PC Engine version,
5136000	5138000	which was switched between two HuCards.
5138000	5147000	Because while it is technically still an 8-bit system, it was the hybrid 8 and 16-bit system.
5147000	5150000	You're trying to keep your spotlight pure this year.
5150000	5153000	Yeah. Next, I typically...
5153000	5155000	This level impressed me that we're looking at on Twitch.
5155000	5156000	Right? It looks perfect.
5156000	5158000	See how it looks so good with the...
5158000	5159000	I mean, and again...
5159000	5161000	The scrolling in this is amazing.
5161000	5164000	1982, 1983 technology. You've got the two levels of scrolling.
5164000	5167000	Well, and look at your other computers that were out at the time.
5167000	5170000	Like the ZX, which was garbage.
5170000	5173000	And the Amstrad...
5173000	5174000	Garbage.
5174000	5176000	You know, all those versions were pretty shit.
5177000	5183000	You are dealing with, I think, as close to Arcade Perfect as the Commodore 64 could possibly get.
5183000	5185000	As a home computer could possibly get.
5185000	5192000	And then, of course, you know, the Master System was fairly perfect because Sega just had that.
5192000	5193000	They did great shooters.
5193000	5196000	Let's flip back to the Master System and kind of end on that note.
5196000	5197000	Okay.
5197000	5202000	And I honestly, though, I think this is the closest to Arcade Perfect that you could get at the time.
5202000	5205000	You know, because you've got multiple layers of parallax and everything.
5205000	5207000	But it goes back to the music.
5207000	5211000	Both of them have a stellar version of that arcade soundtrack.
5211000	5213000	And I am absolutely...
5213000	5217000	I sat and listened to the Master System soundtrack.
5217000	5221000	And then played the soundtrack for the Commodore.
5221000	5223000	And then played the arcade soundtrack.
5223000	5228000	I listened to the R-Type soundtracks three different times.
5228000	5231000	Preparing for this because I fucking love the music in R-Type so much.
5231000	5233000	The first level music is my favorite.
5233000	5235000	It's probably up there for my favorite.
5235000	5238000	It's up there with Fantasy Zone for some of my favorite first level music.
5238000	5241000	So, R-Type, bitches.
5241000	5243000	Alright, there it is, your classic soundtrack of the month.
5243000	5245000	R-Type for the Sega Master System.
5245000	5247000	But a little garnish of the Commodore version as well.
5247000	5250000	And I was going to mention, if you love R-Type, guess what?
5250000	5254000	The R-Type Final 2 Kickstarter is kicking off on June 3rd.
5254000	5255000	What?
5255000	5256000	Take all my money.
5258000	5260000	I don't know, though. R-Type Delta kind of screwed me over.
5260000	5262000	R-Type Final 2 dot com.
5263000	5265000	Alright, awesome.
5265000	5268000	There it is, your classic soundtrack of the month.
5268000	5271000	You know, speaking of soundtracks, one thing I've got to caution.
5271000	5274000	So, I was listening to a gaming soundtrack as I was driving home last night.
5274000	5278000	I was in San Jose for the day for yet another Ingers thing.
5278000	5282000	But I also find really good ways to make these Ingers things about also visiting people.
5282000	5286000	So, I also visited Mel and some of my other friends over there in San Jose.
5286000	5297000	But as I was driving home, I made the mistake of listening to the Wan-gan Midnight Maximum Tune 5 soundtrack by Yuzo Koshiro because it's on Spotify.
5297000	5299000	They didn't have the older ones, or at least I couldn't find them.
5299000	5301000	But five was there. I was like, oh, I haven't heard five yet.
5301000	5303000	And I started listening to that as I was driving home.
5303000	5305000	Bad idea.
5305000	5307000	Because I'm night driving to those soundtracks.
5307000	5309000	Guess how fast I was going down the freeway?
5309000	5310000	In my little Prius.
5310000	5311000	Ninety.
5311000	5312000	Eighty-eight.
5312000	5314000	Which for a Prius, it's pretty fast.
5315000	5319000	So when that Prius hits eighty-eight miles an hour, you're gonna see some shit.
5319000	5320000	It catches on fire.
5320000	5324000	Yeah, right. So, I had to actually stop myself and go, I wasn't doing it for very long.
5324000	5327000	You know, I was like jamming along, jamming along.
5327000	5330000	And then I looked at the speedometer and I was like, slow down.
5330000	5332000	So, anyway.
5333000	5338000	YYR in chat says, hell yeah. Wan-gan Midnight Maximum Tune soundtrack is the real deal.
5338000	5341000	Remember that drive we made to Disneyland?
5341000	5344000	Oh my god. On the I-5 going to L.A.
5344000	5345000	When I was being a little shit.
5345000	5347000	You could do like a hundred and get away with it.
5347000	5351000	Well, but that was me driving my Lancer. Remember the Lancer?
5351000	5352000	Oh yeah, I do.
5352000	5353000	The little silver demon.
5353000	5354000	I do.
5354000	5356000	Listening to Wan-gan and DDR stuff.
5356000	5360000	I remember one time I drove your car because, and somebody else was with us.
5360000	5364000	Like it was, I want to say it was like, it was like Wendell or something was with us.
5364000	5367000	I feel like we were, because we went, or was it Shane? No, it was Shane.
5367000	5368000	It was Shane.
5368000	5370000	Because, but I thought it went up because it was like a DDR.
5370000	5372000	It was a DDR related thing we were doing.
5372000	5377000	We went from the Bay Area all the way down 101 because there was snow on the grapevine.
5377000	5382000	That was right. We were going, was it Disneyland? It was a Disneyland trip.
5382000	5384000	I thought it was a DDR related thing. Why did I?
5384000	5385000	I thought it was a Disneyland trip.
5385000	5386000	Appreciate DDR people.
5386000	5387000	Are you going to Arcade Infinity?
5387000	5389000	It might have been Arcade Infinity trip or something.
5389000	5391000	And it wasn't, we weren't there for the closing of Arcade Infinity.
5391000	5392000	No.
5392000	5394000	But I thought for sure we were there for a Disneyland thing.
5394000	5397000	Because we cannot go to L.A. without Disneyland.
5397000	5400000	Well, especially during that, now it's too expensive. I can't do it anymore.
5400000	5401000	Yeah.
5401000	5406000	But at that time when Disneyland was more affordable, like, it was just funny to say, Disneyland used to be affordable.
5406000	5411000	I mean, it was always luxury, but, you know, this was before Cars Land, before all the remodels.
5411000	5414000	This is when California Avenger was actually California themed.
5414000	5416000	Yeah, yeah, anyway.
5416000	5419000	Alright, anyway, let's take a break. We're going to take a break here in studio.
5419000	5425000	But we have a little prerecorded segment for you guys that has to do with, funny enough,
5425000	5428000	DarkSakura brought up the ZX Spectrum from overseas.
5428000	5431000	She was not a fan of the system, and I will admit.
5431000	5432000	But I want one.
5432000	5436000	Compared to the Commodore 64, it wasn't that great, but it was a big deal in Europe.
5436000	5441000	And if you haven't played a lot of ZX Spectrum games, there is a new service out there that allows you to play,
5441000	5444000	not just those games, but some Commodore games as well, and Neo Geo games.
5444000	5448000	It's a service called Anstream, and it's in early access right now.
5448000	5452000	And I'm a Kickstarter backer and had access to the early access.
5452000	5456000	So I thought we could take a look at Anstream tonight. So let's get to it.
5457000	5461000	Okay, so for our studio break this week, I thought we could take a look at Anstream.
5461000	5464000	We've been talking about it the past couple weeks on the show,
5464000	5468000	as their Kickstarter campaign had kind of kicked off and then subsequently wrapped up.
5468000	5475000	And for those that don't remember, Anstream is that kind of like retro Netflix, if you will,
5475000	5479000	that's available on a variety of platforms, including PC, which is what we're looking at tonight,
5479000	5482000	as well as Xbox One. I know there's some Android-related devices.
5482000	5486000	I think they plan to come out on PlayStation 4 as well. There's a lot. There's plenty.
5486000	5491000	More is available on their site, and they have a variety of older games that are available on the service.
5491000	5495000	Right now, I think there's around 200. I know they have a game list online.
5495000	5499000	And you can see here as we're actually in the client, and I can kind of poke around here and actually show you.
5499000	5502000	Okay, yeah, there's all these different categories that are available,
5502000	5507000	which is interesting because the categories seem to be a little bit random, kind of like what Netflix does.
5507000	5511000	If you've used Netflix before, it'll show you these very kind of obscure categories sometimes.
5511000	5514000	Not that I would call a category like Spectrum Games obscure,
5514000	5519000	but it does seem like the client right now kind of mixes up the different types of games that you will see.
5519000	5524000	Now, it should be stressed that what we're looking at right now is early access.
5524000	5527000	This is a very early version of Anstream.
5527000	5530000	It's only available to Kickstarter backers of a certain level,
5530000	5534000	which obviously since I'm in here, disclosure, I'm one of those backers.
5534000	5537000	But I was always, and I've mentioned this on the show,
5537000	5541000	I was kind of excited that somebody has kind of taken the idea of retro gaming
5541000	5545000	with leaderboards and things of that nature and these challenges,
5545000	5547000	which I'll get into in a minute,
5547000	5551000	kind of reminded me a little bit of what GameTap used to be a long time ago.
5551000	5557000	The other interesting thing about Anstream is that it's kind of like Google Stadia, I guess if you will,
5557000	5559000	where you're not actually downloading the ROMs.
5559000	5564000	You're actually kind of streaming this instance running on another computer up in the cloud,
5564000	5567000	somewhere at Anstream headquarters or wherever their server farm is.
5567000	5571000	But unlike Stadia, which is meant to play state-of-the-art games,
5571000	5573000	because we're looking at retro games here,
5573000	5578000	we're not really talking about the same type of bandwidth requirements and things of that nature.
5578000	5580000	So let me actually get in here and play a game already.
5580000	5585000	You can either find a game on the list, so maybe I can go down to something I recently played.
5585000	5587000	Oh, we can take a look at Monty on the Run.
5588000	5590000	For a lot of people, this is really obscure.
5590000	5596000	This is a Commodore 64 game, but you'll notice it's in my list twice because they have it on Commodore 64 and Spectrum.
5596000	5600000	But this game had a real kick-ass soundtrack, which is one of the reasons why I like it.
5600000	5603000	So you will notice it does take a little bit to load,
5603000	5610000	and I wonder if potentially the Google outages that happened today in the news are maybe affecting this a little bit.
5610000	5611000	I don't know.
5611000	5614000	But you'll notice when you launch the game, you also get an overview of what the GamePad does.
5614000	5621000	I am using a 360 controller, so they did take a lot of the old keyboard games from Commodore 64,
5621000	5627000	or games that had single fire buttons or maybe perhaps used complex layouts on the keyboard,
5627000	5630000	and kind of made them work and went in and made them all work with GamePads and stuff.
5630000	5632000	So let's actually get in there and play.
5632000	5638000	Again, these are older games, so they're not going to look like newer stuff,
5638000	5643000	but without these classic older games, we wouldn't have the same stuff that we have today.
5643000	5646000	So this is a very simple game.
5646000	5650000	It's like a platformer, but you have a jump button, and you move around.
5650000	5655000	And you'll notice it does look pretty good, especially because it is an older game.
5655000	5657000	It probably doesn't need that same type...
5657000	5659000	Oh, that's a thing that...
5659000	5662000	Oh, no, I got smooshed.
5662000	5667000	Because it is an older game, it doesn't have the complex colors...
5667000	5670000	Let me move my mouse cursor out of the way.
5671000	5675000	You'll notice it still has that sweet soundtrack like it had back in the day.
5677000	5680000	I'm not very good at this game. I used to be better at this when I was a kid.
5683000	5686000	Boy, those plungers make a pretty hideous noise, don't they?
5686000	5688000	Let's see if I can...
5688000	5692000	Alright, clearly I'm terrible at this, but that's alright, you get the idea.
5692000	5697000	And it does have a pretty sweet soundtrack when you don't have all those plunger noises in the background competing for that.
5697000	5699000	But that's a little bit about what that looks like.
5699000	5702000	So let me actually pick a different game this time.
5702000	5706000	So we're going to quit out, and this time we're going to go in and...
5706000	5708000	Let's take a look at maybe something a little newer.
5710000	5712000	Oh, like Fatal Fury, right?
5712000	5715000	So there's a few SNK Neo Geo games that are available in here.
5715000	5717000	Let's take a look at this. Let's load this one up.
5717000	5721000	Uh-oh. See, early access. These things are going to happen.
5721000	5723000	I'm not going to worry too much about that.
5723000	5725000	Again, and also there's those internet outages happening today.
5725000	5729000	So I just kind of work around these error messages. They haven't killed my experience yet.
5729000	5731000	Okay, so there we go.
5731000	5736000	So we have a little overview of how we can insert credits and start and all that.
5736000	5738000	And then... Ah, yes.
5738000	5743000	And you know, being that this is a newer Neo Geo game, and some of these games...
5743000	5749000	And I don't even think this is going to come through on the video that you guys are looking at on OLR.
5750000	5755000	But you might see when you do the fade in and fade out, you have a little bit of artifacting.
5755000	5758000	And you might be able to see that as well, like as the characters move.
5758000	5761000	And you can kind of see it just a little bit up in the clouds.
5761000	5765000	So you do get a little bit of artifacting, but it's really not that bad.
5765000	5769000	And again, say as disclaimer a million times, early access.
5769000	5774000	Antstream very much appears to be a company that's based over in Europe.
5774000	5778000	So I imagine, you know, a lot of their early access stuff may actually be overseas.
5778000	5782000	I don't know how much they have over here in the U.S. actually streaming.
5782000	5786000	But otherwise, you know, it's kind of the game that you remember, Fatal Fury.
5786000	5789000	Of course, in the first Fatal Fury game, you could only pick one of three characters.
5789000	5791000	You can pick everybody.
5791000	5793000	But I seem to remember Andy Bogard is pretty awesome.
5793000	5797000	Let's see, and then I can pick who I want to fight, which obviously I want to fight Duck King.
5799000	5801000	So let's see.
5803000	5805000	The sound comes through pretty good.
5805000	5811000	Oh, I see some of that artifacting pretty bad in that transition there.
5811000	5814000	Wow, and I am not as good at this game as I used to be.
5817000	5823000	Wow, I should have just named this segment Watch Rob Be Bad at Old Games, because that's exactly what's happening today.
5823000	5826000	Antstream keeping me humble in 2019.
5826000	5829000	Let's see if I can at least win one round.
5829000	5833000	I also can't remember how to do Andy's special moves. It's been a little while.
5833000	5839000	Was it Back Forward Charge? Back Forward A?
5843000	5845000	Well, this is going swimmingly.
5845000	5848000	There's a guy laughing at me full-on in the background there.
5848000	5850000	Ugh, barf.
5850000	5854000	You know, that's about how well it went for me on a Neo Geo arcade machine, too, to be fair.
5854000	5860000	All right, one other thing I want to show with these, which I think is pretty cool, something that they have built into Antstream that I think is kind of unique.
5860000	5862000	Let me quit out here.
5862000	5867000	So you'll notice that in Antstream I have these little gems up here at the top.
5867000	5872000	So you can use these gems. They're not, and it's not, and they're very explicit to point this out,
5872000	5880000	gems are not like some type of premium currency that you're paying additional money on top of the anticipated monthly fee to have.
5880000	5884000	You actually earn these gems through different challenges that are in the game.
5884000	5890000	So if I actually go back, and there's a whole section that actually has challenges, Fatal Fury is one of them, but that didn't go so well for me.
5890000	5893000	Let me try something else. Ooh, how about Super Dodgeball? Come on, this game was awesome.
5893000	5898000	Not that I'm going to do very well at this either, but we can go in here, and you'll notice there are some challenges in here.
5898000	5903000	So there's a challenge to be like the last man standing. It says survive as long as possible with one team member.
5903000	5909000	You'll notice that's rated like a one, and then we go up to like a level two. Take out the opposing team as fast as possible.
5909000	5915000	And then you can go up a little harder as well, so knock down as many of the opposing team as you can before any of your team gets taken out,
5915000	5922000	and then you can pay 50 gems to unlock that. So the gems are kind of a currency that's used to progress within the challenge system, which is kind of neat.
5922000	5926000	So to show you what a challenge might look like, let's bring up this last man standing.
5926000	5933000	And you'll notice I could challenge a friend. The social stuff, again, since we are in early access, the social stuff doesn't seem to be built out yet,
5933000	5938000	so I can't throw Bobby Black Wolf a challenge for him to ignore or anything like that just yet,
5938000	5945000	and that's going to come in some of the updates up over the next month or so until I think they plan to launch full over the summer.
5945000	5948000	Don't quote me on that, but that's probably their plan.
5948000	5955000	So let's play this one solo, and okay, so pass dodge is B on the Xbox controller, throw catch is play.
5955000	5959000	You'll notice about the challenge, it's going to just kind of start me off right in there, which is kind of neat.
5959000	5962000	So, all right, three, two, one, go.
5962000	5966000	So, all right.
5966000	5968000	Not to get down. I got to be careful.
5968000	5972000	I don't want to get killed. Oh, no.
5972000	5977000	Okay, pant, pant, pant, pick up the ball. Let's go.
5977000	5984000	I just oops, I meant to jump and I just passed the ball.
5984000	5988000	I got a guy on the side. It's been way too long. Okay, double tap is how you run.
5988000	5993000	I knew there's a way to do it.
5993000	5998000	I need to quit throwing the ball at them. Come on. There we go.
5998000	6001000	You get.
6001000	6004000	Oh, no, I died. All right. Oh, no, I'm not dead.
6004000	6007000	Okay. I just flashed from it. I thought that was it.
6007000	6012000	Okay. All right. All right. We're almost up to surviving a whole minute.
6012000	6016000	Oh.
6016000	6024000	All right. At least this is going better than the last one. All right. Let's see if I can.
6024000	6026000	Here we go. Got one of the little guys.
6026000	6029000	I heard the little splat. All right.
6029000	6035000	So, I lasted a little over a minute, but you'll notice it all kind of triggered within there.
6035000	6040000	I got it. Okay. So, I got 69 seconds and that was enough for me to get a bronze medal.
6040000	6046000	And I got 50 XP. So, I'm getting closer to leveling up my little character, my online persona, I guess.
6046000	6049000	And I got a few gems for that. So, that's pretty cool.
6049000	6056000	And then you can actually see like, you know, okay, so I got a bronze and let's see, I could retry if I want.
6056000	6060000	And I think, yeah, it shows you, okay, if I wanted to get a silver medal, I needed to go for 75 seconds.
6060000	6063000	And then I think you can actually look at the scores. I'm not sure how well this is implemented yet.
6063000	6068000	Okay, so these are real people, I'm pretty sure. So, you can see, I think this is like a high score leaderboard.
6068000	6071000	And then you can also look at, you know, similar games and things like that.
6071000	6078000	So, anyway, I think, you know, I showed you the challenges, I showed you like an older game on the Commodore 64 and how that looks.
6078000	6081000	I showed you a newer game on the Neo Geo and how that looks.
6081000	6085000	So, and stream is progressing along very nicely.
6085000	6092000	You know, I'm hoping in a couple months when they've had a little more time to work on it and get some of the feedback for some of their testing,
6092000	6097000	maybe some of those things like the slight artifacting we were seeing in some of the newer games, maybe that'll be addressed a little bit.
6097000	6100000	Although I think it still looks, you know, it's certainly playable.
6100000	6105000	And then maybe some of the like game discoverability features and the social features will be built in.
6105000	6108000	But so far, so good. I'm enjoying this.
6108000	6114000	I think, you know, again, some of these extra things that are built into it, like the challenges, leaderboards and things like that,
6114000	6121000	make it a little more than just, you know, oh, we're just unloading all these games on you, dumping all these games on you for a monthly fee.
6121000	6126000	I like that they're kind of taking it a step further and maybe making something a little more social about it.
6126000	6133000	Because we here at Orange Lodge Radio, we love our old games and it's something we can be very social and talk about a lot.
6133000	6136000	So on that note, we're going to take it back to the studio live.
6139000	6145000	Welcome back, everybody. Live here on June the 2nd of 2019 with episode 778 of our show.
6145000	6149000	And thank you, me, for that little prerecorded segment on and stream.
6149000	6152000	And that was your first time. I know, Jamie, you ran out.
6152000	6155000	You probably didn't see all that, but you saw some of that. What did you think?
6155000	6156000	Looks neat.
6156000	6157000	Yeah, it's kind of neat, right?
6157000	6158000	Yeah.
6158000	6165000	What's funny, I'm looking at some of the comments in chat. YYR says the combat tribes, the combat tribes or whatever you say, is not similar to Super Dodgeball.
6165000	6171000	I'm pretty sure they're using some type of algorithm and it's probably like, oh, people were checking out this Neo Geo games.
6171000	6172000	They were also playing this other.
6172000	6175000	Or maybe just like genre and system or something like that.
6175000	6177000	I think a lot of it is still being refined.
6177000	6182000	Again, I chalk a lot of the issues up to just the early access umbrella, but I like what I see so far.
6182000	6188000	And I think it's also very cool that that, you know, I was playing it on PC, but they are it's on Xbox one right now as well.
6188000	6192000	It's on Android, I think, because early Apple's a little harder with early access.
6192000	6194000	I think they plan to be there, but they're not there right now.
6194000	6197000	And then they're on or they will be on PlayStation four.
6197000	6199000	I think was one of their stretch goals.
6199000	6200000	So it's kind of neat.
6200000	6206000	And I guess, you know, if you have like progress or, you know, the gems, it carries with you from place to place.
6206000	6207000	That's kind of neat.
6207000	6210000	So anyway, we'll be keeping an eye on Antstream as it develops.
6210000	6214000	I have at least a year paid for, so I'll be having it for a while.
6214000	6217000	But it's a great way to experience the old Commodore 64.
6217000	6220000	Does your year start now or does it start when the service actually launches?
6220000	6223000	Funny enough, somebody asked that on the Discord recently.
6223000	6228000	And they say it looks like it starts now because that's how we had to enable all your accounts.
6228000	6232000	But when we officially launch, we'll reset the clock as of the day of the official launch.
6232000	6233000	So that's pretty cool.
6233000	6237000	Yeah, I think I actually ponied up for two years.
6237000	6242000	So I'm a very much a big backer of Antstream.
6242000	6244000	And you guys told me about this too.
6244000	6249000	I had no idea this was a thing until somebody at Orange Launch Radio brought it to my attention.
6249000	6251000	And that was via our Discord server.
6251000	6254000	So thank you to the folks over at our Discord.
6254000	6257000	vognetwork.com or vognetwork.com slash Discord.
6257000	6261000	And you can join and you can tell me these things I should be paying attention to.
6261000	6267000	I had not given to a Kickstarter in a very long time until I gave to this one.
6267000	6273000	But I felt this one, they were kind of showing that they already had kind of a lot of the infrastructure there.
6273000	6278000	This was just to kind of push them out of the gate for launch and kind of help propel them there.
6278000	6279000	And that's why I did it.
6279000	6283000	I wasn't worried about losing money or having to wait years and years and years.
6283000	6289000	I mean, hello, I was a Kickstarter backer for Bloodstained like five years ago.
6289000	6295000	Look, take the time to get it right. I get it, but it's a long time.
6295000	6297000	Hope it is right when it comes out.
6297000	6299000	Hope it's okay.
6299000	6303000	Anyway, Bobby says they are very receptive to feedback.
6303000	6305000	They seem like good people.
6305000	6309000	Yeah, they have their own Discord and they've been very active on there.
6309000	6312000	The people that are developing it as well as their community manager.
6312000	6318000	And because it's based over in Europe, they had a whole channel dedicated to Eurovision.
6318000	6319000	Which I can appreciate.
6319000	6321000	So, I thought it was really cool.
6321000	6322000	Anyway, let's move on with the show.
6322000	6325000	We've got more stuff to talk about, including some rapid fire news.
6325000	6326000	So, let's get to it.
6326000	6329000	Let's talk about those free games that you get with those paid subscriptions.
6329000	6333000	So, starting with the Xbox side of the house.
6333000	6336000	June's games with gold.
6336000	6340000	On Xbox one you're going to be getting EA Sports NHL 19.
6340000	6342000	That's for the entire month of June.
6342000	6346000	And then starting at the halfway point, Rivals of the Aether.
6346000	6349000	That's going to be from June 16th through the 15th.
6349000	6354000	Your Xbox 360 compatible games with Xbox one.
6354000	6358000	Portal's still alive for the first half of June from the 1st to the 15th.
6358000	6364000	And this is awesome because it's your second month in a row that you get another Earth Defense Force title.
6364000	6370000	So, Earth Defense Force 2017, which is definitely better than Insect Armageddon.
6370000	6373000	Maybe not technically better, but it is a better game.
6373000	6376000	That'll be from June 16th through the 30th.
6376000	6383000	And of course, on the Sony side of the house, PlayStation Plus, you're going to be getting Sonic Mania.
6383000	6387000	And Borderlands The Handsome Collection for the month of June.
6387000	6394000	And then, we've got some other Sony games, or previously Sony games.
6394000	6400000	So, you know, there's been some of these exclusives that have been released on the Epic Games Store.
6400000	6407000	Well, now, that game company's journey is going to be heading to PC, exclusive to the Epic Games Store on June 6th.
6407000	6410000	So, if you want to check that on PC, I'm sure that'll look amazing.
6412000	6416000	Interesting that that particular title went exclusive to Epic Store.
6416000	6419000	I think they have Flower on there already.
6419000	6421000	I guess, I think you're right. I think you are right.
6421000	6423000	So, it's kind of interesting.
6423000	6428000	So, anyway, moving on with some other news about games coming to other places.
6428000	6436000	Timespinner, that is a Metroidvania type of game that was pretty well received when it came out on the PlayStation 4 and PC.
6436000	6440000	Well, guess what? It's also coming out on the Switch and the Xbox One.
6440000	6447000	So, this game came out last year, but now the Xbox One and the Switch get their crack at it on June 4th.
6447000	6451000	And obviously, with the Switch version, it'll be a way for you to take it with you on the go wherever you want.
6451000	6456000	Doesn't sound like there's any new exclusive content or anything like that, but still pretty cool.
6456000	6461000	And by the way, if you weren't already aware, we interviewed the developer of Timespinner on Orange Ontario.
6461000	6464000	And thank you, Darktosuya dug up the episode number 571.
6464000	6467000	So, if you want to go back in the archives to episode 571, we actually...
6467000	6470000	And this was long before the game was out when it was still in development.
6470000	6472000	So, it was kind of fun to talk to them then.
6474000	6480000	Also, in rapid fire news tonight, talking about a new type of main cabinet.
6480000	6483000	Kind of in line with those, like, arcade one-up machines.
6483000	6488000	I was in a Fry's randomly this weekend, and they have a bunch of them on display there.
6488000	6492000	I think Walmarts, some of them show, like, they put it in a glass case,
6492000	6496000	because kids at Walmart will beat the shit out of those things, I'm sure.
6496000	6499000	But I think they put it in a big glass case, so you can kind of see it.
6499000	6502000	But the ones at Fry's, you can just kind of walk up and play, they look pretty good.
6502000	6507000	Well, this seems to be another... It's not an arcade one-up, it's just similar to that.
6507000	6510000	Think of that. It's called the Legends Ultimate.
6510000	6514000	It is an all-in-one cabinet, and it's supposed to be starting in July.
6514000	6519000	$599 for a full-sized 66-inch cabinet,
6519000	6524000	or $399 for a compact 44-inch version of the cabinet.
6524000	6527000	But this game is supposed to have between, this is a big window,
6527000	6530000	but 200 to 400 included games.
6530000	6533000	350 are kind of shown on artwork.
6533000	6537000	I will say one of those games is Tron, so you know that got my attention.
6537000	6542000	If you want to show 350 games, a good way to get something to jump out at me is to include Tron.
6542000	6544000	They also had Fix-It Felix Jr.
6544000	6546000	I thought that was interesting. Fix-It Felix is one of the games.
6546000	6550000	So is that like by the same company it does those little mini-arcade things in,
6550000	6552000	because didn't they get the...
6552000	6555000	I don't think they had the exclusive rights to that, though.
6555000	6558000	Was that like a meme ROM that they made?
6558000	6560000	You're talking about, you know what, it's funny, and I can put this on,
6560000	6562000	keep talking, because I have one of these.
6562000	6565000	Yeah, I remember them making the mini cabinet for that,
6565000	6570000	so I was just wondering if it's the same company that's behind that that's doing this larger one.
6570000	6573000	I mean, it seems like the natural progression of things.
6573000	6576000	I don't think so.
6576000	6578000	It's probably the same ROM, though.
6578000	6581000	That's the one that's been going around for a few things.
6581000	6583000	I think the one at Disneyland was the same one.
6583000	6585000	That one is by a company called Basic Fun,
6585000	6588000	and this machine is being put together by a company called AtGames.
6588000	6593000	But I still think that it's still compiling off the same ROM data.
6593000	6595000	Well, probably, I'm sure.
6595000	6598000	They'd probably just pay a licensing fee to the company that made it and go from there.
6598000	6603000	But anyway, just kind of interesting how I guess these arcade 1UP cabinets are doing well enough
6603000	6606000	where other kind of competitors are getting in the business.
6606000	6610000	I'm sure for people's home game rooms and for parties and things like that,
6610000	6613000	I went to a wedding that had a little mini Street Fighter II cabinet
6613000	6618000	because it was two nerds getting married, and the wedding party loved it.
6618000	6620000	So I think they're fun for those types of events.
6621000	6623000	I'm sure we'll see more like this.
6623000	6625000	It's just funny that we have one that's all in one,
6625000	6629000	whereas a lot of these arcade 1UP machines have been one, two, or three games.
6629000	6634000	Kind of like the Mortal Kombat one I've had my eye on is Mortal Kombat 1, 2, and 3.
6634000	6636000	Anyway, DarkSakura, what do you have for us?
6636000	6638000	Oh, some stuff.
6638000	6641000	Detective Pikachu is coming out on the Switch.
6641000	6647000	It is, I think, the same one that was on the 3DS, just touched up.
6647000	6649000	So look for it.
6649000	6654000	And then for other people who like D&D titles,
6654000	6661000	we are getting enhanced versions of Baldur's Gate, Baldur's Gate II,
6661000	6665000	Baldur's Gate Siege of Dragonspear, Icewind Dale, Planescape Torment,
6665000	6671000	and Neverwinter Nights for PS4, Xbox One, and Switch in the fall.
6671000	6675000	Looks like that in North America,
6675000	6678000	the physical editions of the Neverwinter Nights enhanced edition
6678000	6682000	will come out on December 3rd and December 6th elsewhere in the world,
6682000	6685000	while all the other ones are coming out September 24th in North America
6685000	6689000	and September 27th elsewhere for 50 bucks a pop.
6689000	6694000	That's a big unleashing of the D&D games all at once, but that's pretty cool.
6694000	6697000	I'm actually really wanting to play Planescape Torment
6697000	6700000	because I haven't played that in an age.
6700000	6702000	I'm a big fan of the Planescape world.
6702000	6706000	Funny enough, you just spotlighted an old, old D&D game as Classic Game of the Week,
6706000	6708000	not that long, less than a month ago.
6708000	6712000	Yeah, I think I did...
6712000	6715000	I didn't do Ruins of Mythdrine or I did one of the other ones in that series.
6715000	6717000	You did the one that was also on NES, I remember that.
6717000	6718000	Yeah.
6718000	6721000	All right, cool, so that's our rapid-fire news tonight.
6721000	6723000	Let's move on to some world release dates
6723000	6726000	and talk about some games that are coming out around the world,
6726000	6728000	and then we'll get to the mailbag if we have anything.
6728000	6729000	I'm not sure we do.
6729000	6730000	We have a little bit.
6730000	6732000	Just a little bit. All right, so first off, the world release dates.
6732000	6734000	Not a lot of things coming out this week.
6734000	6738000	We've got Kododama, The Heaven Mysteries of Fujisawa.
6738000	6743000	That's coming out on PC, Nintendo Switch, and PlayStation 4.
6743000	6747000	Persona Q2, The New Cinema Labyrinth on 3DS.
6747000	6753000	The Legend of Heroes, Trails of Cold Steel 2 on the PlayStation 4.
6753000	6758000	Warhammer, Chaosbane on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.
6758000	6761000	Slay the Spire on Nintendo Switch.
6761000	6764000	And finally, Octopath Traveler on PC.
6764000	6767000	Oh yeah, that's a lot of people excited to play that
6767000	6770000	until they heard it was a full-price game still,
6770000	6773000	but I don't know, I think it'll still be worth it for many people.
6773000	6776000	Traveling over to Japan, checking out the releases on the PlayStation 4 this week.
6776000	6779000	It's a little bit lighter, probably with E3 on the horizon
6779000	6782000	and the summer and all that, but we still have a few things this week,
6782000	6786000	including Rage 2 gets its Japanese release this week on June the 6th,
6786000	6790000	and then on June the 7th, New Mina No Golf VR,
6790000	6793000	so a golfing VR game is out on the PlayStation 4 this week.
6793000	6799000	Heading over to the Switch, on the Switch this week is nothing.
6799000	6803000	They get a price reduction on FIFA 19, but that's it.
6803000	6805000	The Switch is otherwise quiet.
6805000	6807000	There's a Doraemon game next week, but that's about it.
6807000	6809000	So, a relatively quiet week in Japan.
6809000	6811000	Dara Sakura, how about the UK?
6811000	6814000	We have, on the third three different games,
6814000	6817000	we have Elder Scrolls Online, Elsewhere.
6817000	6821000	We have Persona Q2 New Cinema Labyrinth,
6821000	6823000	and Warhammer Chaosbane.
6823000	6826000	On the fifth, we have MotoGP 19.
6826000	6830000	On the sixth, we have Home Sweet Home for PlayStation,
6830000	6836000	and we have The Legend of Heroes Trails of Cold Steel 2 for PlayStation.
6836000	6839000	All right, let's get to the mailbag.
6839000	6841000	Every week, you guys send us emails.
6841000	6845000	Participate at orangelauntrader.com is the place to send your emails,
6845000	6848000	and we like to read some of our favorite emails here on the show.
6848000	6850000	So, Dark Sakura, I don't know how many we have tonight.
6850000	6851000	One.
6851000	6852000	Just one, okay.
6852000	6854000	That wasn't spam.
6854000	6857000	It has been quite a while since I participated in the show.
6857000	6860000	I am much older than I was when I started listening to OLR,
6860000	6864000	so Sunday Night Live shows are too late for old me to stay up for
6864000	6866000	and go to work Mondays.
6866000	6870000	You have to remember, the East Coasters, it's three hours ahead over there.
6870000	6873000	The show goes till midnight on the East Coast, so it's a little harder for them.
6873000	6876000	I admit I have no question or reason to write in.
6876000	6878000	I just wanted to say thank you.
6878000	6881000	I've communicated with each of you outside the show for various reasons.
6881000	6884000	You are just real people at the end of it all.
6884000	6888000	My life has bounced back for the horrible year of 2013.
6888000	6892000	This is good.
6892000	6895000	I remarried, have been enjoying the little things like travel
6895000	6897000	and spending time at camp on weekends.
6897000	6902000	My daughter graduated college two years ago and is getting married this November.
6902000	6906000	I won't say how old she was when I started listening, but you get the idea.
6906000	6909000	I can't say thank you enough for everything you do.
6909000	6911000	One day I would like to meet you all in person.
6911000	6913000	Have a great show.
6913000	6914000	And that's Name and Lights.
6914000	6915000	You're so welcome. Thank you.
6915000	6917000	I knew who this was the minute you said it.
6917000	6920000	I think of his real name because I get the Facebook messages.
6920000	6922000	Yeah, I remember the real name more than the...
6922000	6924000	Yeah, exactly. I remember the real name more than I do the online.
6924000	6926000	So I had to think about it. I was like, oh, yeah.
6926000	6928000	Yeah, yeah. The minute he talked about his bad year, I knew who that was.
6928000	6932000	Yeah, I remember just talking with him when all of that went down.
6932000	6933000	It was just so terrible.
6933000	6938000	Well, thank you so much for being here with us through the thick and the thin.
6938000	6941000	And glad to hear things are a lot better for you now. It's great.
6941000	6945000	I think all of us, and we've talked about it here on OLR, we've all had rough years.
6945000	6947000	We've all had low points.
6947000	6949000	And you're right, we are real people.
6949000	6954000	We play as many games as we can between our day jobs and all that.
6954000	6956000	But at the end of the day, we're real people.
6956000	6960000	And we're so happy that you guys come out here and participate with our show.
6960000	6964000	And kind of join us on these Sunday evenings.
6964000	6969000	Rob, is that a still shrink-wrapped DDR Extreme 2 for PS2?
6969000	6973000	Yes. Why?
6973000	6975000	I just looked over and I wasn't expecting to see it.
6975000	6979000	There's also a shrink-wrapped version of Karate Revolution Country over there.
6979000	6982000	Well, you could guess why that's still shrink-wrapped.
6982000	6984000	Because it's garbage, but yeah.
6984000	6986000	Here's the thing.
6986000	6994000	Somebody got me that because they were giving it as a promo or something.
6994000	6995000	That might have been me.
6995000	6997000	It might have been. I think it might have been.
6997000	6999000	He was like, Rob likes DDR. He'd like that.
6999000	7003000	But by that time, my PlayStation 2 was already up and away in favor of my PlayStation 3.
7003000	7005000	Which wasn't backwards compatible.
7005000	7008000	So yeah, I still have that kind of relic there.
7008000	7010000	But you know what?
7010000	7013000	Somebody's going to want that dance pad that's in there because it's going to work great.
7014000	7018000	I still have two Xbox 360 dance pads.
7018000	7022000	Yeah, and the chats are like, what the hell, it's still sealed?
7022000	7023000	Yeah, that's still sealed.
7023000	7025000	And yeah, the karaoke revolution country.
7025000	7026000	That one has a microphone in it.
7026000	7028000	But let's be real. We all know why I never opened that.
7028000	7031000	You don't like singing the country?
7031000	7032000	I don't know.
7032000	7034000	Oh, my ex is living in Texas.
7034000	7036000	Is this Shania Twain?
7036000	7038000	That don't impress me much.
7038000	7039000	That's all I know.
7039000	7042000	I only know old country.
7043000	7044000	We don't play.
7044000	7046000	Oh, and Fancy. Does it have Reba Fancy?
7046000	7048000	Dude, if it's got Reba, that's worth playing.
7048000	7049000	That's true.
7049000	7051000	Well, now we have to find out.
7054000	7057000	I'm opening that shit right now if it's got Reba.
7057000	7059000	Does it have Randy Travis on there?
7059000	7063000	I don't know the actual artists on these because it just has the names.
7063000	7064000	But let's see here.
7064000	7066000	Fancy. Is Fancy there?
7066000	7067000	Better have Fancy.
7067000	7069000	That's the only reason to own that game.
7069000	7071000	Is Dolly considered country enough?
7071000	7073000	Yeah, Dolly's still country.
7073000	7075000	Code of Many Colors, 9 to 5?
7075000	7078000	Or, uh, Jolene?
7078000	7079000	Oh, Jolene.
7079000	7080000	I would sing Jolene.
7080000	7084000	Yeah, I think this is just like kind of the top 40 crap.
7084000	7086000	What was cool then?
7086000	7088000	9 to 5 is like the first song on the list.
7088000	7089000	So it's got Dolly.
7089000	7091000	So there is that. Let's see.
7091000	7093000	It's, uh, Chattahoochee?
7093000	7095000	I know Chattahoochee.
7095000	7096000	I know that song, too.
7096000	7098000	That was when I was still having to go to Dothan for the summer
7098000	7100000	and being subjected to all that.
7100000	7101000	Friends in Low Places.
7101000	7102000	That was a good song.
7102000	7105000	No Fancy, though, because this is alphabetical.
7105000	7107000	So, save a horse, ride a cowboy.
7107000	7109000	What's that?
7109000	7111000	Stand by your man.
7111000	7114000	Stand by your man.
7114000	7116000	I only know that one from the Blues Brothers.
7119000	7121000	This episode of OLR brought to you by...
7121000	7123000	Derailed by Konami.
7125000	7126000	Anyway, here you go, Pikachu.
7126000	7127000	Why don't you...
7127000	7129000	That little product placement there right in your arms.
7129000	7130000	Thank you.
7130000	7131000	Pika-what?
7134000	7137000	Darticu says, karaoke revolution, country, stream, when?
7137000	7139000	Okay, there's so many problems with that because
7139000	7142000	A, I don't even have a working PlayStation 2 anywhere anymore.
7142000	7144000	B, I don't...
7144000	7145000	They don't use...
7145000	7146000	Do PlayStation 2s have HDMI?
7146000	7148000	I think they only have component.
7148000	7150000	They only have component.
7150000	7152000	But I've got converters.
7152000	7158000	I do have a first model PS2 that is still in perfect working order.
7158000	7160000	I have a Japanese one that's still in perfect working order.
7160000	7162000	But I only have an HDMI capture card.
7162000	7164000	So if it doesn't output HDMI, I can't do it.
7164000	7166000	I've got converters.
7166000	7167000	Okay.
7167000	7169000	I'm worried about input lag.
7172000	7177000	You can split the component cable and then capture off of...
7177000	7180000	But, I still have your capture.
7180000	7181000	Yes, the capture card will do it.
7181000	7183000	And the CRT monitor.
7184000	7187000	But, I have a PlayStation 2.
7187000	7189000	I don't know if it reads discs anymore.
7189000	7191000	Okay, I'm just gonna say, I don't wanna fucking play
7191000	7193000	karaoke revolution, country.
7193000	7195000	But it's enhanced for the iToy.
7195000	7197000	If we're gonna hook up PlayStation 2,
7197000	7200000	that one, maybe I'd play the DDR Extreme,
7200000	7203000	or I would play BeatMania 2DX or something, but...
7203000	7205000	Honestly, Rock Band is better than karaoke revolution,
7205000	7207000	just saying, cause karaoke...
7207000	7209000	Well, the Japanese karaoke revolution is a shit to play.
7209000	7211000	And I bet Rock Band has fancy.
7213000	7215000	Fancy is a good song.
7215000	7217000	Alexa, does Rock Band have fancy?
7219000	7221000	I probably set off someone's machino.
7223000	7226000	Okay, Google, turn the lights to 50%.
7226000	7227000	Stop it.
7227000	7229000	That's okay, none of the Google servers are working anyway,
7229000	7231000	so you're fine.
7231000	7233000	I wanna know who I fucked up now.
7233000	7234000	Moving on.
7234000	7236000	Alright, stop messing with people.
7236000	7238000	That's it for the mailbag. Thank you.
7238000	7241000	From very kind email to karaoke revolution country,
7241000	7243000	the tangents are strong this week on OLR.
7243000	7245000	But we still have some more video game news to get to
7245000	7247000	before we get to your calls on our Discord server.
7247000	7251000	To answer your question, I believe fancy was part of Rock Band 2 DLC.
7251000	7252000	Perfect.
7252000	7254000	At least that's a YouTube video that says it was,
7254000	7256000	so I'm gonna assume the title's correct.
7256000	7259000	And that means we can probably import it into Rock Band 4,
7259000	7261000	although the window for that is probably up,
7261000	7263000	but Jamie, if at all possible,
7263000	7265000	I think we need to do fancy.
7265000	7268000	Oh my god, you did set off two people's Alexa.
7268000	7272000	You set off Act Defs and Brad from Pod Culture.
7272000	7275000	Did I get anybody's Google shit?
7277000	7279000	Sorry, I wasn't trying to do that,
7279000	7281000	but I think it's really funny.
7281000	7282000	Hey Alexa, play-
7282000	7284000	No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
7284000	7286000	We're not gonna be that show. Alright, move on.
7286000	7287000	I don't wanna be funny.
7287000	7288000	Next story.
7288000	7289000	I didn't trigger Google.
7289000	7291000	I just got a text. Jerk.
7291000	7292000	Who was that?
7292000	7293000	From Pod Culture.
7293000	7294000	Oh.
7294000	7296000	I don't know, I was gonna have him play fancy.
7297000	7298000	Play fancy.
7298000	7301000	Fancy is the official new song of OLR.
7301000	7303000	Alright, moving on.
7303000	7306000	So, Call of Duty.
7306000	7309000	They made the new announcement for the new Call of Duty,
7309000	7311000	which is just gonna be Modern Warfare,
7311000	7314000	as opposed to Call of Duty 4 Modern Warfare.
7314000	7315000	It's a reboot.
7315000	7317000	It's gonna be out October 25th,
7317000	7319000	and what do we know about it?
7319000	7323000	Well, they said that they're not gonna do an annual pass,
7323000	7328000	that they're gonna have free content, maps, and, you know, stuff like that.
7328000	7330000	You know that means loot boxes.
7330000	7333000	That's just gonna fucking be full of fucking loot boxes,
7333000	7336000	and cause- I'm sure it's full of crap like that.
7336000	7339000	There's no way that they're not gonna do something like that.
7339000	7342000	It is gonna be cross-play, so you can play between console and PC.
7342000	7347000	No word on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, though.
7347000	7349000	It's a brand new engine,
7349000	7352000	and there's gonna be a single-player campaign,
7352000	7355000	which means I'm gonna get it, because it has a single-player campaign.
7355000	7358000	And co-op is back.
7358000	7360000	And yeah.
7360000	7362000	So that'll be awesome.
7362000	7363000	I am very excited about it.
7363000	7365000	And I'm assuming this is gonna be a big E3 push.
7365000	7366000	Oh yeah.
7366000	7368000	Activision doesn't really participate in E3.
7368000	7372000	Sony, though, has the DLC timed exclusiveness.
7372000	7373000	Sony's not doing E3.
7373000	7374000	Right.
7374000	7376000	Yeah, I don't know.
7376000	7379000	I just imagine news will probably drop E3 week,
7379000	7381000	whether they're there or not.
7382000	7383000	Maybe.
7383000	7384000	I don't know.
7384000	7386000	Maybe the Switch gets it this year.
7386000	7388000	Maybe it's one of those 21 games.
7390000	7392000	Except you can't play with your friends online.
7392000	7394000	Just kidding.
7394000	7397000	Except it is Call of Duty 4 Modern Warfare.
7397000	7400000	The original, not remastered. Just the original.
7400000	7401000	So let's be real, Loki.
7401000	7404000	Out of the three of us, you're the only one that would be interested in a game like this.
7404000	7406000	You thinking about picking this one up?
7406000	7407000	Yeah.
7407000	7408000	Yep. No question.
7408000	7410000	It looks good.
7410000	7411000	Let's move on.
7411000	7415000	You know, sometimes if you want to make a choice on if you're gonna buy a game or not,
7415000	7417000	it might help you to be able to play that game in advance.
7417000	7423000	And that's exactly what Nintendo plans to do with what they're calling a road rules style trip.
7423000	7428000	A reference that nobody that would be the age of playing the Switch would even understand.
7429000	7432000	Y'all remember that old show Road Rules on MTV?
7432000	7433000	I remember.
7433000	7435000	I auditioned for Road Rules.
7435000	7436000	Can you believe?
7436000	7437000	Oh god, I shouldn't even say that here on the show.
7437000	7438000	I did.
7438000	7440000	I auditioned for Real World and Road Rules.
7440000	7442000	It was the year...
7442000	7443000	It was Hawaii.
7443000	7445000	It was whatever year that was for Real World.
7445000	7447000	I sent in an audition tape for Real World Hawaii.
7447000	7450000	And I wasn't even out of the closet at that age.
7450000	7452000	Can you imagine what a fucking mess I would have been on that show?
7452000	7455000	Thank god I got a polite rejection letter in the email.
7455000	7457000	Or in the mail.
7458000	7459000	Anyway.
7459000	7466000	But Nintendo is gonna be doing less reality TV and more getting the Switch out there to play for people.
7466000	7470000	After E3 is all done, it sounds like they're gonna kinda take their booth on the road a little bit.
7470000	7472000	So it's gonna go on a little tour.
7472000	7476000	It starts in Chicago from June 26th to the 30th at the Navy Pier.
7476000	7482000	And will travel around the country, including right here in Sacramento at the California State Fair.
7482000	7484000	July 12th through the 14th.
7484000	7487000	So not the duration of the State Fair, but just those few days.
7487000	7489000	I remember, do you remember this?
7489000	7493000	When Rock Band 2 was traveling the country, they were at the State Fair.
7493000	7495000	And we went and we played it.
7495000	7497000	Rock Band 2 at the State Fair.
7497000	7498000	I remember that.
7498000	7500000	I did not play it there.
7500000	7501000	Or did I?
7501000	7502000	It was the first game.
7502000	7511000	I played Rock Band though they did a thing that they were in West Sac for some festival, like music festival thing.
7511000	7516000	And they had a Rock Band 2 or Rock Band stage set up and I remember playing it there.
7516000	7523000	Well they'll be going from one VOG Network headquarters to another as they wrap up at the Georgia National Fair in Perry, Georgia.
7523000	7525000	I'm not sure if Perry is an Atlanta suburb.
7525000	7527000	But what games are going to be there?
7527000	7528000	The games that are going to be there.
7528000	7534000	Super Mario Maker 2, which is, I mean, it's going to be out by the time the game hits the first stop.
7534000	7535000	But okay, whatever.
7535000	7541000	Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, Pokemon Let's Go, Super Mario Party, and Splatoon 2.
7541000	7542000	Here's my thought.
7542000	7546000	They probably aren't announcing the ones that they haven't announced at E3 yet.
7546000	7549000	So I wouldn't assume it's going to be limited to this.
7549000	7555000	Because especially if it's traveling through October, you better believe there's going to be some holiday stuff in here too.
7555000	7559000	So I would think Animal Crossing maybe? Depends if it's playable at E3 or not.
7559000	7566000	But that could be interesting, Dark Sakura, if Animal Crossing is a game that is part of this bus.
7566000	7568000	Are we going to have to go to the State Fair?
7568000	7569000	I reckon.
7570000	7576000	Well, on the plus side, they have a karaoke booth at the State Fair and I can sing fancy.
7576000	7577000	I reckon.
7580000	7582000	This is my pained look.
7582000	7586000	Here's your one chance, Dark Sakura, don't let me down.
7586000	7588000	Here's your one chance.
7588000	7589000	There's your one chance.
7589000	7590000	You're letting me down.
7590000	7591000	All right.
7592000	7595000	SSG100Matt says, go to the fair and do video.
7595000	7596000	I just might.
7596000	7597000	I just might not.
7597000	7598000	I just might.
7598000	7599000	All right.
7599000	7602000	Bobby Blackwell says, Perry is a two hour drive for me.
7602000	7603000	Bummer.
7603000	7605000	Because the State Fair is like 10 minutes from here.
7605000	7606000	So.
7607000	7609000	YYR says to get the deep fried butter.
7609000	7610000	Oh, God.
7610000	7611000	Didn't we do?
7611000	7612000	What did we do?
7612000	7616000	We did deep fried Twinkies at one of our tournaments.
7616000	7618000	Alan and I went to the State Fair randomly one year.
7618000	7621000	We had deep fried Oreos and I just.
7621000	7623000	They're not that good.
7623000	7625000	And none of that deep fried stuff is that good.
7625000	7626000	It just tastes like batter.
7626000	7627000	Do I really want to eat a stick of butter?
7627000	7628000	No.
7628000	7629000	No.
7629000	7633000	Our next tournament should be called Sacramento Makes Aggregious Gaming.
7634000	7638000	S-M-E-G.
7639000	7640000	Stop it.
7641000	7643000	Well, we've had scat before.
7644000	7645000	Yeah.
7645000	7649000	For those who don't know, we had a DDR tournament here that we were all involved in and planning with.
7649000	7653000	It was called Sacramento Cosplay and Tournament.
7653000	7655000	And then what was the next one that we did?
7655000	7656000	A shaft.
7656000	7657000	Shaft.
7657000	7659000	Sacramento hosts another fucking tournament.
7659000	7661000	It was another fabulous tournament.
7661000	7663000	Behind the scenes we were calling it another fucking tournament.
7663000	7664000	Yeah.
7664000	7665000	Yeah.
7665000	7666000	So there you go.
7666000	7667000	Shaft was fun though.
7667000	7668000	That's when we had.
7668000	7669000	Shaft was a great tournament.
7669000	7670000	It was fun.
7670000	7671000	We had people from everywhere.
7671000	7672000	Shit.
7672000	7673000	We should do that again.
7673000	7674000	No we shouldn't.
7674000	7676000	Jamie, we're in our 40s now.
7676000	7677000	Fuck.
7677000	7678000	I didn't say we're going to participate.
7678000	7679000	You ain't got time for that.
7679000	7681000	I didn't say we're going to participate.
7681000	7682000	Alright.
7682000	7683000	Moving on.
7683000	7684000	Anyway.
7684000	7685000	It wasn't my turn.
7685000	7687000	I can participate in average attack.
7687000	7690000	Because I'm pretty good at being average.
7690000	7691000	Sometimes passing stuff.
7691000	7692000	That's what we should do.
7692000	7695000	We should do like how to be average at DDR.
7695000	7697000	We should call it the mediocre tournament.
7697000	7698000	Alright.
7698000	7699000	How to be the most mediocre.
7699000	7700000	Alright.
7700000	7702000	I'm going to lay down the law with this next story.
7702000	7703000	Darsakra.
7703000	7704000	Yeah.
7704000	7705000	Well.
7705000	7706000	Um.
7706000	7707000	And.
7707000	7708000	I.
7708000	7712000	I was looking at everything and this one just sort of is weird.
7712000	7717000	So there is a lawsuit by Iron Maiden.
7717000	7719000	Or at least.
7719000	7726000	Their holding company has filed a 2 million dollar lawsuit against 3D Realms for their
7726000	7729000	game Iron Maiden.
7729000	7730000	Um.
7730000	7738000	Claiming that it's using quote incredibly blatant end quote trademark infringement over
7738000	7740000	so many different things.
7740000	7746000	And it says that Iron Maiden would cause confusion amongst customers.
7746000	7749000	I mean it's a video game so I don't know.
7749000	7755000	But it says that their Iron Maiden name is of course very close to Iron Maiden.
7755000	7756000	Um.
7756000	7760000	And it also that the logo looks the same.
7760000	7763000	That it's composition looks the same.
7763000	7768000	And also other things that they're using that name to sell merchandise.
7768000	7769000	Um.
7770000	7777000	On top of that too is that they named a character after Steve Harris.
7777000	7779000	And reworked their logo.
7779000	7780000	Um.
7781000	7786000	And that you know it also points out that the band has their own video game Legacy of
7786000	7787000	the Beast.
7787000	7788000	Um.
7788000	7793000	Yeah they named a character Shelley Harrison after Steve Harris.
7793000	7799000	And then it has the same type of looking gameplay as their game Legacy of the Beast.
7799000	7804000	And it uses their yellow bomb emoji.
7804000	7805000	Sorry.
7805000	7806000	Shut up Siri.
7806000	7812000	And so they use their yellow bomb emoji is similar to the Iron Maiden.
7812000	7815000	Any character who shows up in all of their stuff.
7815000	7821000	So it sounds like there's a question here like is this parody or is this really kind
7821000	7822000	of like make him.
7822000	7827000	I kind of get the sense that Iron Maiden maybe kind of had to file this because you know
7827000	7831000	if you don't protect your intellectual property which Iron Maiden is a band is if you don't
7831000	7834000	file to protect it then you have the possibility of losing it.
7834000	7840000	Except I don't necessarily think they're being dicks but except Stern released Iron Maiden
7840000	7841000	pinball.
7843000	7845000	Yeah but they probably had to license that.
7845000	7848000	Yeah but that means that they still have.
7849000	7854000	I mean basically their their stuff is still protected it's still registered they would
7854000	7858000	have had to have renewed any of their licensing to be able to outsource it.
7858000	7862000	So as folks on Twitch can see Alan just sat down and join us because he's he's doing that
7862000	7865000	thing where he's like I've got something to say he can hear the show going on in the other
7865000	7866000	room.
7866000	7868000	I just want to warn you this mic cable doesn't have a lot of slack on it so you might have
7868000	7870000	to lean forward a little bit but what do you want to say.
7870000	7874000	It'll be brief and yes I'm putting away groceries something piques my ear and I'm like well
7874000	7877000	I have to give my opinion right now because it is very important.
7878000	7882000	When dark secrets first started reading this story I was like it's a pun.
7882000	7883000	Calm down.
7883000	7887000	But then as the details kept going out more and more about how like they named it after
7887000	7894000	the singer and the icon like it definitely sounds like they are it's be it's beyond just
7894000	7895000	a pun.
7895000	7896000	They're cashing in.
7896000	7902000	They are making it really really miss mistake or something that's affiliated with the band
7902000	7904000	but otherwise I and Maiden it's funny.
7904000	7906000	That's a that's a great pun.
7906000	7908000	But they just kept they kept kept it going.
7908000	7915000	Like if I was going to do a game called Iron Maiden I would have it be more like an electric
7915000	7920000	themed game or something you know with a cutesy girl that doesn't look anything Iron Maiden
7920000	7921000	like.
7921000	7925000	Now I made Alan sit back down because if you're going to invade the show like that then I'm
7925000	7927000	going to ask you some questions have you talk about other stuff.
7927000	7933000	So besides just Iron Maiden for your gaming week I know you picked up a new game because
7933000	7939000	you're a big fan of a gaming series that I used to like a lot but what how is your gaming
7939000	7940000	week.
7940000	7941000	What did you pick up.
7941000	7945000	It's Overwatch but you're specifically talking about MK 11.
7945000	7947000	I am so MK 11 you've been playing it.
7947000	7948000	What do you think.
7948000	7950000	The story was really good.
7950000	7958000	I really like how they are handling the particularly the female characters compared to how MK 9
7958000	7959000	looked in 2011.
7959000	7961000	But yeah the story is great.
7961000	7966000	You know Jennifer I love Jennifer Hale you know fem chef forever but I feel like her
7966000	7973000	voice is so recognizable to me that she just sounds the same even though I know she's doing
7973000	7977000	different characters like because she's asked from Overwatch she's chronic and MK 11 and
7977000	7979000	I'm like oh well that's Jennifer Hale.
7979000	7984000	She's the OG she's the amazing voice actress in all video games but I just hear her all
7984000	7985000	the time.
7985000	7989000	But you noticed who voiced her daughter Mary Elizabeth McGlynn.
7989000	7990000	Yes.
7990000	7996000	And Ronda Rousey who I know is problematic for a bunch of other reasons.
7996000	7997000	She did a good job.
7997000	7998000	Yeah.
7998000	7999000	Yeah.
7999000	8004000	Everyone's like when Sonya talks Ronda Rousey and I'm like her performance in this video
8004000	8006000	game is not one of the things you should be talking about.
8006000	8008000	She's a great Sonya.
8008000	8009000	I thought she was great.
8009000	8010000	Yeah.
8010000	8011000	Yeah.
8011000	8012000	Interesting.
8012000	8016000	But you know all the other crap we will leave to being outside the game I suppose.
8016000	8018000	So separate the art from the artist I guess.
8018000	8019000	So all right.
8019000	8022000	That was really all I want to give out since I can't talk about MK 11.
8022000	8023000	I thought maybe you'd want to say something.
8023000	8024000	So anything else for you.
8024000	8025000	It is on your wish list.
8025000	8028000	I was thinking about getting it for you but then you'd have to stream it and you'd be
8028000	8032000	like ew it's gross ew stop it and I don't want to waste like $60.
8032000	8034000	I've already had it threatened.
8034000	8039000	Good old Shane keeps saying you need to get Five Nights at Freddy's VR.
8039000	8041000	Don't you want to stream Five Nights at Freddy's VR?
8041000	8044000	Like Five Nights at Freddy's VR would be fun for the following reasons.
8044000	8045000	OK.
8045000	8048000	So Rob I know we haven't talked in a day but last night I made a list of 20 reasons why
8048000	8051000	you should have Five Nights at Freddy's VR.
8051000	8056000	Aside from getting you the game he needs to write like a check like to the charitable
8056000	8057000	organization of your choice.
8057000	8061000	I will play it for five minutes if you give five hundred dollars to the Southern Poverty
8061000	8064000	Law Center and he's like I'm never doing that.
8064000	8067000	And you're like well then I guess we have our answer.
8067000	8069000	I'm going to remember that one for later.
8069000	8070000	I'll probably get it.
8070000	8071000	Thank you Alan.
8071000	8072000	Thank you for crashing the show.
8072000	8073000	Your opinion is always welcome.
8073000	8074000	You know that.
8074000	8077000	I bought it and I almost purchased it today.
8077000	8079000	I'll play it I guess.
8079000	8081000	I don't really like Five Nights at Freddy's.
8081000	8084000	My God he does not stop talking about Five Nights at Freddy's.
8084000	8087000	It's everything that comes out of his mouth is Five Nights at Freddy's.
8087000	8089000	He's playing Five Nights at Freddy's Roblox stuff.
8089000	8092000	I'm telling you when I did that panel with the voice actors at Dragon Con like I was
8092000	8096000	thinking it was going to be people like Shane like you know just like but no it was all
8096000	8098000	like 12 year olds in the audience.
8098000	8099000	The kids love it.
8099000	8100000	It could be Fortnite.
8100000	8101000	It could be worse.
8101000	8102000	It could be Fortnite.
8102000	8103000	That's true.
8103000	8105000	It could be girls in Fortnite but just mostly the creative mode.
8105000	8110000	But yeah it's like it's just it's all about Five Nights at Freddy's.
8110000	8113000	It's like always just spewing Five Nights at Freddy's facts.
8113000	8118000	And like you know I always got that thing from like my wife about how she would say
8118000	8120000	that I talk about games too much.
8120000	8123000	It's like it's always games games games.
8123000	8126000	It's like I never thought I would get to the point where I get annoyed about hearing
8126000	8130000	about something from somebody about a similar topic over and over.
8130000	8135000	But here we are at this point where I was like I really don't give a shit about Five
8135000	8140000	Nights at Freddy's that I need to hear about this much about this one game.
8140000	8141000	But dad did you know.
8141000	8142000	Dad did you know.
8142000	8143000	Did you know.
8143000	8145000	Did you know.
8145000	8147000	Daddy I have something to tell you.
8147000	8148000	OK.
8148000	8153000	You know in Five Nights at Freddy's you know sister location you get blah blah blah blah
8153000	8154000	blah.
8154000	8159000	And in this one they have a nightmare Freddy you can do this and twisted this and I like
8159000	8160000	I don't care.
8160000	8165000	I swear to God I need to make an overlay for our twitch thing that like takes the sidebar
8165000	8169000	away and puts tangent train with a little train ground because right now it still says
8169000	8174000	I am made in lawsuit and how disconnected have we become from that topic at this point.
8174000	8175000	It's just funny.
8175000	8176000	Incredible.
8176000	8179000	Welcome to Orange Lounge Radio y'all.
8179000	8180000	All right.
8180000	8181000	Moving on.
8181000	8185000	Speaking speaking of things in places where they don't belong what do we have next.
8185000	8186000	Yes.
8187000	8193000	We have cars getting more games so apparently for some reason you can port or you're going
8193000	8201000	to be able to play Cuphead in a Tesla because that's a neat thing to do I guess.
8201000	8206000	I'm not sure why you want to do that trip but it's only compatible I guess with a wired
8206000	8210000	USB controller so you can't do any touch screen stuff.
8210000	8213000	But why the hell would you want to in the first place.
8213000	8215000	Sorry you can't play with the steering wheel.
8215000	8217000	But yeah.
8217000	8220000	So it's neat that you can play a game on it.
8220000	8221000	And Bob.
8221000	8226000	Bobby does point out it only works in park so it's not for the passenger which is probably
8226000	8230000	for the best that these things only work when the car is parked.
8230000	8231000	Yes.
8231000	8232000	So neat.
8232000	8234000	It's a neat unnecessary thing.
8234000	8238000	Can you sit there and play it while you're waiting for the car to charge because I imagine
8238000	8242000	the inflow from the chargers far outweighs what it costs to play the game.
8242000	8244000	Maybe might be a way to kill time while you're waiting.
8244000	8245000	I don't know.
8245000	8247000	So that might be a neat idea.
8247000	8248000	Yeah.
8248000	8249000	Or how about you know Bob.
8249000	8251000	Bobby says it's for the supercharger stops.
8251000	8252000	Yes.
8252000	8253000	That's what it's for.
8253000	8254000	That's what all the Atari games are for.
8254000	8255000	So I hit it.
8255000	8256000	I hit.
8256000	8257000	I feel.
8257000	8258000	Wow.
8258000	8259000	My mind.
8259000	8260000	It's just like Elon Musk's.
8260000	8261000	Wow.
8261000	8265000	Maybe we can get Xbox Game Pass or their streaming service or something like that in on that.
8265000	8269500	And I think that's a pretty clever idea though because you know that's the one thing that
8269500	8273000	some people have reservations about the Tesla is that with the big road trips you have
8273000	8276800	to kind of make the stops you know and you might have to stop a little bit longer than
8276800	8280000	you might have to at a gas station to charge the car a decent amount.
8280000	8283440	But you know Tesla's thinking of these ways to make that time passing a little more fun
8283440	8287920	which I'm still I still would be I would be interested in a Tesla someday you know maybe
8287920	8293000	when my current car gives out if the price on those things keeps coming down and as technology
8293000	8297000	gets better and better and the rest of the auto industry is responding you know with
8297000	8300580	things like Prius Prime and the other you know electrical cars are seen out there I'm
8300580	8303740	just so curious what's going to look like in just a few more years.
8303740	8304740	So anyhow.
8304740	8305740	All right.
8305740	8309420	They said though it isn't the full version of Cuphead.
8309420	8317420	Apparently Tesla has some storage limitations and so only Inkwell aisle one section is available.
8317420	8321580	Well then you should be able to continue on to download the next section instead you know
8321580	8322580	as you go along.
8322580	8323580	Yeah.
8324160	8330840	Or you know maybe expandable memory expandable storage because I'm sure that right now Loki
8330840	8332520	is it a car or a game console.
8332520	8334220	Come on.
8334220	8335220	Why not.
8335220	8336220	Both.
8336220	8338480	All right.
8338480	8343080	I still like the idea that there's like pole position on those cars but you actually use
8343080	8344240	the steering wheel.
8344240	8348240	I would like to see Mario Kart but you actually use the steering wheel.
8348240	8352080	I forgot to mention during game day it's probably not technologically possible but give give
8352080	8353080	Tesla.
8353580	8359260	I played the I forgot I did play the beta test for the mobile marker I've heard it's
8359260	8367180	controversial as some of the microtransactions yeah it's it's all right.
8367180	8372140	I wouldn't play very long comes the tangent range you know I'm just that's all I got.
8372140	8373140	What.
8373140	8374140	Tell us.
8374140	8375140	Tell me a little more about it.
8375140	8376140	So like the controls are OK.
8376140	8381720	But yeah it is pretty heavy on the microtransactions I played a few races in there.
8381720	8387020	I still don't like the controls like didn't seem that it seemed kind of floaty for me
8387020	8392900	but I don't know I don't know if I could see myself playing it for a very long time.
8392900	8394500	It was cool to try out though.
8394500	8397540	I guess we'll see when the game releases.
8397540	8398540	Who knows.
8398540	8402980	Anyhow before we get to our listener roundtable if you have some questions in our chat room
8402980	8408940	or you want to give us a call via our discord server over at vog network dot com slash discord.
8408940	8412920	Before we get to that let's talk about the Contra collection because you know Konami
8412920	8416480	had that arcade collection not that long ago they just recently did the Castlevania collection
8416480	8420840	which I picked up and some people are looking forward to the Contra collection and the full
8420840	8425440	list of what will be available in that collection has been announced including Contra the arcade
8425440	8432020	version Super Contra the arcade version Super C on the NES Contra 3 on the Super Nintendo
8432020	8438880	that was nice Contra hardcore on the Sega Genesis Contra on the NES Contra on the Famicom
8438900	8446580	Operation C on the Game Boy, Probo Protector on the Sega Mega Drive which is kind of like
8446580	8451020	Contra adjacent and Super Pro Protector Alien Rebels on the Super Nintendo.
8451020	8453500	They were reskins for Europe.
8453500	8461700	Ah gotcha so that's what those are so that is all coming out let's see oh by the way
8461700	8467060	they also announced the Japanese games will be included in an in like a patch that follows
8467060	8471720	a little later on so there is that as well that's pretty cool $20 they haven't dated
8471720	8478720	it yet I thought they did so now could this be hinting at something bigger and perhaps
8478720	8483000	this is one of those 21 games we're going to learn about next week or a little over
8483000	8491020	a week a German retailer net games has posted a new Contra game on switch PlayStation 4
8491020	8498320	and Xbox one all sharing a release date of September 24th 2019 this is a from the collection
8498320	8504080	so could after all Konami had pretty good success when they rebooted bomber man could
8504080	8509960	Contra be next on their list I'll be very interesting to see so maybe that's maybe that's
8509960	8515860	something in store for e3 we'll see I fully look forward to Contra act zero you never
8515860	8521160	know you never know all right yeah dark to see and chat over twitch TV slash vlog network
8521160	8525880	says I didn't think this listing was for Contra collection yeah so if this new one is good
8525880	8529920	I'd be down yeah it's all about what they plan to do with it that's for sure so we'll
8529920	8535960	see so anyway I'm gonna get discord up here so we can actually take some calls and discord
8535960	8540440	and if you have questions in our chat room over at twitch TV slash vlog network you can
8540440	8545360	ask away there as well while I'm getting set up here since I'm a couple weeks out of practice
8545360	8548460	Loki do we have any last minute stories things we want to talk about before we get there
8548460	8555100	uh no I know I thought we had extra stuff we didn't come oh yeah I'm fine new stuff
8555100	8559660	I need to talk about okay well I do one and then I'll get to a call all right fine so
8559660	8567700	I I did bring up earlier when we're talking about the new R type thing so that was pretty
8567700	8574060	awesome that they're gonna have that Kickstarter well there's stuff checks quest the remaster
8574060	8581280	finally came out so you can check it out and they added the third episode so that's
8581280	8586760	pretty cool you can actually play that I think for free where can we download that is it
8586760	8595280	checks quest calm or something I don't know yeah checks mix comm slash checks quest and
8595280	8601400	you can download it and play it I'm so excited I'm going to get right on that while I are
8601400	8605140	asked did they announce a developer for the contra collection m2 did the Castlevania
8605140	8609100	collection and that's why it was really good hamster did the arcade collection that's why
8609100	8614020	it was really bad I didn't realize they had different developers I thought I thought m2
8614020	8620100	is doing them all but I guess not one other thing we can talk about so John Romero made
8620100	8627220	a new doom mod or super water make a wad for the game so it's called sigil you can go check
8627220	8633840	that out as well so that's a pretty cool thing yeah you can get that at Romero games
8633840	8642840	dot IE slash sigil it with a six instead of a G all right and no I can't I tried googling
8642840	8647340	it and I don't I don't see who is actually doing that yet so we'll have to wait and see
8647340	8652680	so orange right thinks it's got to be m2 though so yeah I kind of I kind of agree with that
8652680	8659380	so all right well let's get to some calls at vog network.com slash discord and we've
8659380	8662980	brought our first person into chat so let's say hello hi you're on orange on radio who's
8662980	8668900	this yeah this is middle man ham how are you hey I'm good how are you buddy I'm pretty
8668900	8677200	good you know actually the lineup of your topics it was perfect timing because I was
8677200	8686580	planning on talking about retro collections sure as we all probably know very very well
8686580	8695400	you know retro collections have been coming out for ages at least since the 16-bit generation
8695400	8704780	sure super mario all-stars was a retro collection of sorts right exactly so it you know I was
8704780	8713640	wondering if I have a two-part question a do you have like a particular favorite retro
8713640	8720760	collection and B has there been any collections they have not come out yet for whatever reason
8720760	8726520	that you would like to see okay good questions a what is your favorite retro collection thus
8726520	8733360	far any any answers to that I would actually say honestly even though I just said it super
8733380	8738780	mario all-stars like set the bar in many ways like yeah it really you know it kind of reskin
8738780	8743420	those games and especially like the way mario one kind of looked was really transformed
8743420	8749300	and it brought you know the lost levels which we all know was mario 2 in japan to us for
8749300	8753620	the first time and I thought I think was just such a bang-up well-done collection and with
8753620	8757260	as much shit as we give nintendo on this show for some of their choices such as the mario
8757260	8761140	maker multiplayer man when they invest in something like that like a retro collection
8761140	8766500	like they they do a really good job I did like the mega man legacy collection yeah that was pretty
8766500	8771540	good yeah those are pretty good too uh dar sakura you you're a big retro gamer what do you have any
8771540	8776020	retro collections that you're a fan of uh we haven't bought any in so long I mean we've got
8776020	8783220	some of the title collections we have um well I mean I did just last year grab salamander deluxe
8783220	8790020	pack for the sake of saturn so that's a retro collection I mean it's really kind of hard for
8790020	8795060	us to pick up any of the newer ones because we either have the original title or we have another
8795060	8800500	collection that's got it in there so you know I would say the other standouts that come to my
8800500	8805620	mind before we get to question b uh I would say the other stand is my mind the grottiest collection
8805620	8811620	on psp was very well done and the psp just in general you know we kind of look back on it as
8811620	8814820	you know it was in some ways was ahead of its time there were some really good games on it like it
8814820	8819380	had the best version of fantasy 4 although that wasn't a red that wasn't a retro collection but
8819460	8824980	yeah the grottiest collection on psp was great uh and I would say the midway arcade treasures
8824980	8827940	were pretty good for their time they had you remember those the midway arcade treasures I
8827940	8832500	think was on the original xbox uh as well as it might have been on 360 I think it was the original
8832500	8837780	xbox as well as like playstation 2 and those were some good collections of um you know 80s arcade
8837780	8842340	games at the time you know midway put out some really good uh games back in the day and you know
8842340	8846420	things like root beer tapper and robotron and it was this really good collection I think they had
8846420	8849540	three of those at the end of it because I think the third one was all like racing games but the
8849540	8855700	first two uh especially were really really solid so um yeah those are my answers uh act deft points
8855700	8861140	out in our chat room the sega genesis collections are really great too oh yeah I think playstation
8861140	8866340	yeah those are xbox 360 had that sega mega genesis collection or whatever yeah those are pretty good
8866340	8872100	those are really good yeah that was a sega did a great job with those on console so um yeah so
8872100	8878100	then metal mayhem's b question was what's a retro collection you would like to see
8878100	8884180	that's a pretty good question as well uh loki uh that's a tough one um
8887300	8893300	I don't know I mean there's just so much stuff out there I would like to see maybe like uh just a
8894020	8897540	I don't know we already got in like a Nintendo collection too with like the NES classics so
8898420	8903380	uh I don't know I don't have an answer for that I guess if I'd like to see anything I would love
8903380	8912900	to see like a collection um a new collection of dreamcast or uh sega Saturn games I want a PC
8912900	8921220	engine um shooters compilation like some of the ones we never got in the US um and another
8921220	8926500	actually the ginga density series that came out on PSP in Japan love to have that come out of
8926500	8930740	here because I think people need to play sapphire uh how about that second it sets
8930740	8934820	who collection in the us I'd like to see that which by the way did make our show world tonight
8934820	8941540	but I believe uh there was one of those trademark filings that said collection of mana so that that
8941540	8945140	might be one of the 21 yeah there you go there that might be that's you know I mentioned earlier
8945140	8950660	there's your screen yeah so that that one could be real and again that is a big fucking deal
8951540	8956740	if they get second three if second three is a part of it which may explain why it's taken
8956740	8963060	a long time to get from the Japanese version to here if they cut second three then my my
8963060	8968260	answer is null and void but there is a fan translation that has been deemed as free use
8968260	8974900	oh yeah the roms already but even the the Japanese text in the graphics have been translated I would
8974900	8978500	love to see and for them to put out that collection here I would love them to see
8978500	8983060	add secretive evermore I know that game gets shit on as the square USA title but I think
8983060	8987220	there were some great there were some great moments in that game that are worth you know
8987220	8992500	and it's it's it was Jeremy Saleh's first composition so you know he went on to do you
8992500	8996900	know what guild wars and elder scrolls and all that stuff what if we had a new Sega ages fantasy
8996900	9005460	star collection or Sega ages does such good retro stuff well I've got the the first fantasy star
9005460	9009620	Sega ages one the Japanese one and it's pretty beautiful I mean we played it with a friend
9009620	9016420	translating it for us but it was great or or or or or I want a grandia collection like all three
9016420	9021860	grandia games I would as they were I would like to see this is going to be a little bit cliche
9021860	9029540	but I would like to see a final fantasy collection on switch that's one through six but takes the PSP
9029540	9035380	version of most of those or the Game Boy Advance version of like six some of those yeah none of
9036340	9044340	the 3d stuff yeah but I mean or both porque no los dos have them both so uh but let me choose
9044340	9050740	if I want to play Final Fantasy 4 in 2d or in 3d I shouldn't I shouldn't the 3d was okay but
9050740	9056740	obviously since my memories go back to Final Fantasy 2 on the Super Nintendo right that's
9056740	9060340	just how that game is always going to be for me I was just still tickled we got you know that
9060340	9065060	Castlevania collection with Rondo of Blood and everything yeah because fucking Rondo of Blood is
9065060	9070660	probably the bet well I will say Symphony of the Night or Nocturne in the Moonlight is probably
9070660	9076340	one of the best Castlevania games ever but Rondo was fucking badass yeah with the multiple paths
9076340	9081780	and everything huh so Metal Mayhem before I let you go what retro collection would you like to see
9083060	9089700	uh well I think it's been done on the PS2 already but unfortunately I never got it
9090500	9096260	so I'm gonna say uh Samurai Showdown collection for PC
9097780	9107140	know that yeah I know that you know Samurai Showdown 2 and 5 are available on both steam and
9107140	9117940	dog around those two games are great but my personal favorite is 4 because I sunk entire
9117940	9126420	paychecks into you know Samurai Showdown 4 while I was in college way back in the day I have not
9126420	9134100	been able to play in that game since and I I know if you want to go the shady route you can
9134100	9140900	illegally download DRAM but you don't want to go down to that route I want I want to support
9140900	9145460	SNK you know hey hey dark to see he's got some good news for you there is a Samurai Showdown

9151700	9158900	Switch but I don't know who to switch so well a lot a lot of those show up on PC so you might get

9166740	9172500	have a good one you too buddy take care all right let's get to another call hello you are on Orange
9172500	9177620	Tons Radio who's this hey this is Acteft hey Acteft it's good to hear from you buddy what's up
9178900	9183860	well I want to talk about the Pokemon conference that happened this week yeah I've been kind of a
9183860	9187700	little bit out of the loop on Pokemon so I'd love to hear your thoughts I mean obviously
9187700	9193060	Pokemon Sleep was a thing but uh what what were your what was your thoughts on it well yeah
9193060	9198900	Pokemon Sleep was probably like not necessarily the biggest but the most interesting of all of all
9198900	9205780	the announcements they made especially because it's it seems kind of weird for Niantic in this
9205780	9212980	case and also Pokemon Company and Nintendo to to focus on that but if if if we look back to
9213620	9220260	the Vitality sensor and other stuff that Nintendo has tried to to do with health and all that stuff
9220260	9226820	and in the past it's it's something like okay I can see it work again not necessarily something
9226820	9234100	that most people will be like really excited about but me personally I'm really like interested
9234100	9242100	in it and and how it works and and probably can how can it uh benefit or how can it help for
9242100	9251460	for our health but but yeah aside that uh we also had uh some really great and big announcements too
9251460	9258260	like uh you already talked about Detective Pikachu on Switch and and it's something like okay since
9258260	9264980	I didn't get the 3DS version I'm really excited to get that on Switch I heard it's not the greatest
9264980	9270340	game or the most difficult but it seems like if you like the movie if you like the story and
9271060	9277860	you want to like explore a little bit more of the lore it seems like a good option but also like
9277860	9283940	Pokemon making its way to China it's like a really big deal that is that is a very big deal
9283940	9288980	you're right uh it's a heck of a thing to uh to um overlook but obviously that's something that's
9288980	9293620	not going to impact this market but sure as Pokemon on a global scale uh Pokemon coming to
9293620	9299060	China is a huge deal yeah and and and this is certainly not the biggest game like it's Pokemon
9299060	9308820	Quest and it isn't that great of a game uh but at least for like making its way like Pokemon making
9308820	9315060	like its appearance official appearance at least in China it's it's gonna be huge I think and
9315060	9322580	hopefully it it will work and maybe the market there will expand like a lot because uh I think
9322580	9328180	currently you cannot play Pokemon Go in China so it's like no maybe that will change in the future
9328180	9332740	but yeah I don't even know if Ingress is a thing in China I think I think it actually I think it
9332740	9338020	does exist but I yeah I don't even know to like yeah I think actually there is Ingress uh and
9338020	9343540	stops and things like that so it's the infrastructure set up for it uh with all the stops and the the
9343540	9347860	spawns but yeah I don't know if it's actually there or if it's firewalled out or what so
9348420	9354340	um be interesting to see what develops with that for sure yeah that's that's gonna be like really
9354340	9361220	really great to see and again hopefully it will work for Pokemon Company uh on China but the
9361220	9369220	future will tell um other thing uh a style Pokemon Home that's gonna be like I'm really excited about
9369220	9377860	that actually like it's it's probably like the most the the thing that most people like are
9377860	9384180	really like hyped about yeah and basically and you already talked about it but I'm gonna
9384180	9388900	try to explain it like uh briefly it's basically you can transfer any Pokemon to the cloud
9389700	9398340	from your 3DS like the virtual console games and and the sixth generation seven generation uh also
9398340	9404660	from Pokemon Let's Go, Pokemon and Pokemon Go even like it's gonna be awesome that you can transfer
9404660	9411380	all to the cloud and you can move them to Pokemon Sword and Shield and that's gonna be like really
9411780	9418340	really great because uh like it's it's really a hassle for for those who want to complete the
9418340	9425300	Pokedex like have in this case it's gonna be like over 900 Pokemon at this point so it's like yeah
9426340	9432340	like having like your Pokemon from like spare Pokemon from Pokemon Go and even Let's Go and
9432340	9437940	other and other and the other game sorry it's gonna be like really great to complete uh your
9437940	9444100	Pokedex and just focus like oh I only need the the ones from this generation or I don't need
9444100	9450500	that many so it's that it's gonna be really really good and again most people are really
9451060	9456820	I'm really excited about that one I hope I hope that the service doesn't cost that much because
9457620	9464260	Pokemon back is I think it's like five dollars a year yeah so hopefully it doesn't hopefully
9464260	9470740	doesn't like uh go up in price that much but still it will be like a really great service
9470740	9474580	hopefully yeah and I'm really curious like the balancing there I mean it sounds like you know
9474580	9477860	it's going like you're not like taking stuff and putting it in Pokemon Go or whatever but it
9477860	9482740	sounds like Gen 8 is going to kind of account for all that um and before I let you go I'd actually
9482740	9488420	like to ask your opinion uh since we know we have a big Pokemon Direct next week focusing on Gen 8
9488420	9492660	I'm just kind of curious like what are your hopes and dreams for the Pokemon Direct this coming week
9494260	9501700	um my hopes and dreams I hope I hope and I have some really big hopes and dreams for for this but
9502260	9511060	mostly I just want the release date and maybe uh some to see some of the new Pokemon on on this uh
9511060	9518980	new game certain shield I'm pretty sure you'll get just more info yeah yeah sorry that's fine
9518980	9522020	I was gonna say there's probably a lot of things that we just haven't thought about yet but uh the
9522020	9527060	Pokemon games tend to have a lot of you know sub games within them so I'm sure we're going to learn
9527060	9534100	about a lot of that in the the Pokemon Direct this week so and before I go uh just I want to
9534100	9538100	also mention the last thing that they mentioned on the Pokemon conference all right that Pokemon
9538100	9545860	Masters game if if anyone that knows like those type of game the gacha games like Fire Emblem
9545860	9553860	Heroes Dragalia Lost another many many games of the type if if it works correctly if it if it's
9554660	9562660	at least decent this game will explode like you have no idea because if people like are eating
9562660	9568180	stuff like Fire Emblem Heroes and Fire Emblem Heroes it's like Fire Emblem isn't that big yet
9568820	9575780	it's it's still kind of niche niche uh a niche uh franchise franchise sorry here in America
9575780	9582660	Pokemon is gonna blow that up like wow I'm really really excited about that but at the same time I'm
9582660	9589540	really worried I I can see that it's always uh it's always scary territory uh especially when
9589540	9593700	you know things are like things that are kind of underground are starting to all of a sudden blow
9593700	9598660	up but I think it'll I think it'll I think it'll be fine hopefully all right my friend I'm gonna
9598660	9601860	let you go so we can squeeze in one more call but thanks so much for the call appreciate it
9601860	9606820	hey thanks for having me anytime take care buddy all right let's try to squeeze in one more call
9606820	9610260	because I saw one other person join the green room I want to get them on so hello you're on
9610260	9618900	orange sounds radio who's this oh huggy hello this sounds like first mate slide kick from
9618900	9625860	game buoy am I correct yes and the library is open oh wait that's from show yeah wrong show
9625860	9634820	so many podcasts I just say hey girl hey hey well so I now look uh since we got emails tonight we're
9634820	9639620	not allowed to recap the finale of drag race although you know the right person won yes she
9639620	9645700	did but anyway what's on your mind in the gaming world tonight so um I've been lately devouring all
9645700	9650420	of the news from the shadowbringers media tour I feel like every time I call in lately it's
9650420	9655620	about final fantasy 14 surprise uh but I don't know if you've been following lately but um
9656260	9660820	you know they talked about a lot of the changes to like the battle system that they've kind of
9660820	9668180	been teasing um they had the live letter that had all those memes about uh you know the sound
9668180	9674580	issues and stuff and then they had the media tour so uh you know a lot of people are comparing the
9674580	9680660	changes to some of the changes we saw in wow uh you know I don't remember what expansion it was
9680660	9686980	but uh one of the things is like the tanks are basically just having a tank stance for
9687540	9694820	you know generating aggro but otherwise uh you know a lot of the like enmity rotations are gone
9694820	9702820	healing like they took away a lot of the emphasis on dps and I've seen a lot of people like upset
9702900	9708580	about it and um feeling like the game's being dumbed down and then especially they have like
9708580	9713380	the charged actions which you know we've seen those in wow too so a lot of people feeling like
9713380	9719780	it's just you know turning into more and more of a wow clone I'm curious if you're what are your
9719780	9723860	thoughts about it I think people should give it a chance we need it we haven't seen how these
9723860	9728500	end game raids look like we have I think anytime you got the expansion that goes in there rebalances
9728500	9733460	things people get freaked out I mean why is wow classic a thing you know because due to all the
9733460	9737940	innovations wow has made people say oh but I I missed the days when it was complicated and you
9737940	9741940	had to be level 40 to get a mount and there was weapon skill and now that like blizzard is putting
9741940	9747540	out exactly that people are complaining about well these are bugs you know and it's a feature not a
9747540	9751940	bug I think I think people should like just feel it out and give it a chance a little bit I think
9751940	9756580	especially when it comes to things like you know just making sure that all tank moves get threat
9756580	9760500	instead of having to do these basic combos and things like that like the those sorts of things
9760500	9765780	make sense to me and that maybe healers right dpsing so much uh those sort of things make sense
9765780	9771300	and and a lot of the moves they've been showing uh like the death knights getting clones and the
9771300	9775860	astrologians having more zodiac influence things and stuff like a lot of it looks really cool and
9775860	9783220	I'm here for it so um yeah I mean you know just as MMOs evolve and update and and want to innovate
9783220	9787700	every few years you know these are things that are are going to change um I'm fortunate enough
9787700	9793220	that I I know a couple of people that got to go to the media tour and everything everyone that has
9793220	9797620	had their hands on it that I've talked to had positive things to say about it so I'm looking
9797620	9802020	forward to it as well I was a little salty about fall fantasy 14 when they didn't do the boy bunnies
9802020	9808100	but I've had enough time to you know get the fuck over it I suppose maybe next expansion uh and I'm
9808260	9814100	excited for the the different job stuff and I think you know a lot of the stuff that isn't getting a
9814100	9819140	lot of focus I think is going to be a big deal for some people I know such as the whole trust thing
9819140	9822980	and the fact that you can just go through these new dungeons I don't think they work in the old
9822980	9829220	dungeons but you can go through the new story for shadowbringers um you can use these trusts to run
9829220	9832980	the dungeons with you and you don't have to interact with other people so if you're nervous
9832980	9837860	about tanking or healing or something that you know there's one of you and not a lot of room to
9838660	9841780	uh if you're nervous about that and you don't want to do that with other people because you're
9841780	9845140	afraid you're gonna you know screw up other people's experiences you can do it yourself
9845140	9850740	with trust now and I think that's a huge thing for people um so I think there are a lot of great
9850740	9855700	things that they're doing um it sounds like there's still more to come because they aren't
9855700	9861620	talking about pvp at all have you noticed that and I think they said yeah it's gonna sit on that
9861620	9868900	until 5.1 and let everybody experience the pve for a couple months and then get into pvp stuff
9868900	9873140	because square's not gonna let that go for final fantasy 14 yet they still would like to see that
9873140	9878100	a thing and actually if you do get in there and do the pvp it's really well done it's I've never
9878100	9884340	done pvp and uh but I've heard that it's not too um inaccessible that you know it's uh that's
9884340	9890580	pretty fun well what's interesting it it dumbs down the rotations you have way less buttons
9890580	9896420	that you use in pvp and uh yeah the the matches are are neat like I really like doing the wolves
9896420	9900100	den because like you know when you eliminate somebody a big uh thing comes up on the board
9900100	9905540	it says little pound cake has eliminated such and such and the metals it's just it's the
9905540	9909860	presentation and the pop and circumstance is really well done which you'd expect out of a
9909860	9914980	modern final fantasy title I'm sure yeah I mean I think that a lot of the changes seem like really
9914980	9920100	good quality of life changes and I think once people get their hands on it they'll be like okay
9920100	9925300	I don't know what I was complaining about um in my opinion too where the bar is set with
9925300	9930740	final fantasy 14 in the expansion is the story and we don't talk about this enough like realm
9930740	9935540	reborn story was okay it was it was good it was passable because you know they had a lot they had
9935540	9941460	to do with that game to reinvent what was a shit game uh the 1.0 final fantasy 14 but when we got
9941460	9948660	into the expansions heavensward and stormblood like those stories are like some of the best
9948660	9953700	if not maybe the best in the in the entire franchise not ever agreed a fan of stormblood
9953700	9960420	story like I thought especially I loved it from yeah from 4.0 to 4.1 oh my god like I was shook
9960420	9965300	at the ending to stormblood and what they did with that I was like not not this not the four
9965300	9969620	five ending but like I don't want to spoil it but there's definitely like a cinematic sequence that
9969620	9974580	happens at the end when everybody comes together and I was just like holy shit I was not expecting
9974580	9982180	that but that was powerful you know yeah right mm-hmm so yeah so before I uh let you wrap things
9982180	9990500	up um knowing that you got your start with vdr and bimani and everything are you like totally
9990500	9995700	thrilled that there's almost a rhythm game element to playing dancer with all the little steps and
9995700	10001460	stuff uh it reminds me of that suzaku fight where you have the little arrows you have to kind of
10001540	10004820	turn around yeah I think it's cute I think it's cute that they have a little bit of the rhythm
10004820	10008660	game influence in there uh with the dancer I don't know if you know this but um it's kind of
10008660	10014260	like ninjas with the is it easy to dancer it's I see what you did there but yeah you hit these
10014260	10019060	little you hit these little notes or you hit these little uh keys in time with something and it's it
10019060	10026660	does the actions it's funny I'm totally gonna play dancer but not at first but everybody's gonna play
10026660	10032340	dancer at first and I'm gonna focus on my healer I'm not and then uh get into you know actually
10032340	10038580	what I really want to play is machinist because yeah changed machinist so now come on automaton
10038580	10045300	queen yeah final fantasy 14 machinist is now like edgar in final fantasy 6 yeah and they even
10045300	10051460	showed the poison the was like is a move that you can do and I was like dang this is cool so I'm
10051540	10057380	really excited about that yeah myself is the only final fantasy 8 fanboy in the world basically
10058180	10064420	I'm totally here for gunbreaker it looks super fun and uh yeah yeah I can't wait so I'll see you in
10064420	10068180	game yeah I can't believe the expansion is the end of this month it's sooner rather than later

10197780	10205300	thought because my head is too herdy like because I have had like the the sickness of the the con
10205300	10212740	crud and the allergenus yeah you can kind of see it on there barely it's enough it's enough extreme
10213620	10221620	but um but I I have the pain of the centuries in my head because my head is full of is a
10221620	10227220	nightmare of snot and tiny jackhammers all right well feel better I'm I'm right there with you
10227220	10232180	suffering with the the Chicago plague or what I think there's just cold going around everywhere so

10238340	10244260	airplane so similar um but man if you've never done solo Disney fucking do it let's see my

10280020	10286660	thought is that I'm gonna try to stream some more DDR this week I haven't been streaming every day
10286660	10291860	that I play because sometimes I just also want to just get 30 minutes in and then actually do
10291860	10296820	weightlifting this week though I did weightlifting after not doing weightlifting for a very long time
10296820	10302020	and I fucked up my arms for like the entire week so they're unfucked now so I get to uh
10303140	10308180	do it all over again watch watch your form just watch your form I need to get back in the gym
10308180	10312580	habit very bad I fell off that wagon you know with everything going on and then I'm sick I haven't
10312580	10316820	been able to go since I got back from Chicago so I'm really trying to get back on that I got told
10316820	10320980	not to weight lift I was I got the okay to go back into powerlifting because you know I was
10321060	10326900	powerlifting before I hurt my back I got up to like a deadlift of 200 and then with the problems with
10326900	10332020	my neck I got told to hold off on my powerlifting until my neck is dealt with oh wow so I'm very
10332020	10339140	upset by this because I like being able to to deadlift 200 pounds and watch guys like lose their
