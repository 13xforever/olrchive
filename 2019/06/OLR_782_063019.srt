00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

5
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:45,000
It is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight with episode number 782 for this June the 30th of 2019.

6
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
My name is Rob Roberts and joining me tonight, Techmaster Loki here in studio.

7
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Hello.

8
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Hi, how are you?

9
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I'm very full.

10
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
You're very full?

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Yes, I had some katsudon before the show started.

12
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
It looked like a baby threw up in that plate and you ate it.

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
It looked much better on Friday when it had the same thing.

14
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:14,000
It's supposed to be just like pork cutlets that are breaded and fried and then they do onions and carrots and then there's a scrambled egg over the top.

15
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,000
All that smelly stuff and I'm surprised, Mr. Smoosh, my dear kitty is not out here going meow meow meow and smelling all that stuff.

16
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
But seriously, it looked like my cat had vomited into rice and then that was what I was eating.

17
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
But it was delicious vomit.

18
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Sometimes food that doesn't look appetizing actually ends up being really freaking appetizing.

19
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
It is good.

20
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:40,000
It's so good that I've been craving it since I had it on Friday and so I bought some today and then I also bought the stuff to make it at home for this week.

21
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
So, are we having it again?

22
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I don't know.

23
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Alright.

24
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Well, it's a little bit of a weird show tonight.

25
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Not joining us tonight is Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers.

26
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
She has the night off.

27
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
She is attending San Francisco Pride.

28
00:01:52,000 --> 00:02:01,000
As she's mentioned on the show before, she's a member of the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence and this is a big, big weekend for the sisters, certainly in Northern California as well as other places.

29
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
So, there was a lot of Pride celebrations around the world this weekend.

30
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
So, I know I said it at the beginning of the month, but you know what?

31
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I'll say it one more time here.

32
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
At the end of the month, these things are winding down with the celebrations.

33
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Happy Pride to everybody out there.

34
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,000
And yeah, you know, it's one of those things that hopefully doesn't go away once June is over.

35
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:26,000
But I think we've made a lot of wonderful, wonderful progress in the past 50 years since Stonewall, but there's still so much further to go.

36
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I'm going to try not to soapbox too much tonight because I know we want to get into video games, but that is certainly on my mind a lot.

37
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
So, Dark Sakura will be joining us again next week.

38
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
And Jason, you may have noticed, was absent from the intro.

39
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:45,000
So, you've got a very rare, I can't, it's been years since we've had one of these intros because, and I'll tell you why I didn't do it either.

40
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
So, Jason, he was at the Summer Games down quick.

41
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Yeah.

42
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
So, he was, he's traveling today because that just wrapped up.

43
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
So, he's, we will talk about that later in the show.

44
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I know many of you were watching and I do have a spot to talk about later in the show, don't worry.

45
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:04,000
And Jason's traveling, so he was unable to do, he kind of was at a spot.

46
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:11,000
He thought he might be at a spot where he kind of like pull over, record it, but he kind of couldn't do it because I got him the stuff late because,

47
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
and I couldn't do it because I was out of town last night. I went to a concert.

48
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:23,000
So, I went to see Carly Slay Jepsen, who I think a lot of people probably, I don't know, some people know, some people don't.

49
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
But Carly Rae Jepsen is, I think she got big through Canadian Idol.

50
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I don't know if I want to say she's like the Kelly Clarkson of Canada because I'm opening myself up to Well Actuallys.

51
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:38,000
But she's had a pretty good career ever since she did Canadian Idol. Her biggest hit was Call Me Maybe.

52
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
That song got memed to hell, right? Everybody had that whole thing.

53
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:47,000
But the thing, the gag is, if you actually listen to some of her later stuff, like some of her other albums like Emotion and stuff,

54
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:53,000
like for me, like there's some really like solid like pop like anthems on there. It's really like infectious.

55
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Like it's just kind of like, oh. So, it was good. It was like a late birthday present because my birthday obviously was this past week.

56
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Allen's is coming up. So, we splurged. We did VIP. We got to do the meet and greet.

57
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,000
So, she was really sweet and all that. It was great. She complimented my shirt.

58
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Not this one, obviously, but I was wearing one with cats on it. So, she thought it was cool.

59
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:18,000
So, yeah, that was my little Carly Rae story. So, but that was in Reno.

60
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:24,000
So, we drove up to Reno to do that. We could have gone to San Francisco, but I figured with pride in San Francisco this weekend,

61
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:31,000
that means traffic. That means impossible to park. Whereas, I'm thinking in Reno, I'm like all the casinos have free parking

62
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:36,000
because they want you to go there. And sure enough, it was easy peasy going to Reno.

63
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:43,000
So, in the theater, they did it out there as brand new. So, long story short, I was in Reno up until like a few hours ago.

64
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
We got back from Reno. So, I had to kind of abbreviate my show prep tonight.

65
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:56,000
So, speaking of concerts, Bobby Blackwolf, who's usually on before us at the Voice Geeks Network at vognetwork.com

66
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,000
because we do tape every night. No, we do not tape every night. We'd be tired.

67
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:08,000
We do tape every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Blackwolf show usually.

68
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:14,000
But he is off this week because he is at a Weird Al Yankovic concert.

69
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,000
So, I have Carly Rae Jefferson. He has Weird Al Yankovic. But I think Weird Al is really cool.

70
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:24,000
And honestly, a worthy reason to miss the show for a night. He's earned a night off.

71
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,000
So, that's where he's at tonight. So, he didn't have a show tonight. So, yeah, it's like a weird night all over the place.

72
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Like three people usually involved with Sunday nights are gone MIA. I almost kind of decided to call off the show tonight.

73
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:42,000
But you know I don't like missing a lot of shows. I feel like there's enough for us to talk about with you guys in our chatroom

74
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
over at twitch.tv slash vog network.

75
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Dartutuja says, it didn't seem like there was too much news anyway, at least outside the GDQ stuff.

76
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Yeah, it does seem like things are really quiet this week. And I don't know if that's still kind of like the post E3 kind of slumber or what's going on there.

77
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I think it's post E3 because we're just a few weeks away from what was it?

78
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Gamescom, which is another like big announcement space. So, you know, I don't want to like announce too much stuff in between then

79
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
because then when are you going to announce it? Gamescom.

80
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Plus a lot of stuff has just like come out. You know, now we're kind of getting into that summer release window

81
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
because you know the schools everywhere I'm from, it's a good time to release games.

82
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
But it's actually really light usually.

83
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I feel like I'm so behind right now. Like I have not played nearly as many games as I should be.

84
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:36,000
And I'll get into why that is a little later. But I know Bloodstained came out and I need to get on that, that's for sure.

85
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I have my Switch version, although I've heard there's some issues. We'll talk about that later in the show.

86
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Mario Maker 2 for sure.

87
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I did pick that up. I haven't played it. My kids played it.

88
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Tell us more later during the game week.

89
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
And then what else? There's another one that came out.

90
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Oh, Final Fantasy XIV's expansion, which I suppose will lead us into tonight's kickoff topic.

91
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
So Final Fantasy XIV's expansion released this week.

92
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
So Shadowbringers is the brand new expansion and it launched.

93
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I guess the early access happened on Friday and technically the game's actual launch is Tuesday.

94
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:18,000
But for most MMO players, I'm pretty sure the Final Fantasy XIV fans, a big majority of them preordered Shadowbringers.

95
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Just because they know they're going to buy it anyway is where I'm at.

96
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,000
And so you have that three or four day early access into Shadowbringers.

97
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:33,000
So it's been up since Friday. It sounds like it hasn't had quite the chaotic issues that some of the other launches had for Final Fantasy XIV.

98
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:38,000
So that's been a good thing. Like there was not errors where people were trying to get into a cutscene and they couldn't.

99
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Because that was a big thing that happened with Stormblood.

100
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,000
It does sound like the servers got DDoSed at one point, or at least that's what Square Enix claims happens.

101
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
So there was some problems there. Some big login queues.

102
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
But, you know, kind of, I guess par for the course with MMO launches.

103
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I suppose as far as most MMO launches go, it could have been a lot worse.

104
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,000
And then, and we'll get into more on Final Fantasy XIV here in a minute.

105
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:06,000
But speaking of the game releases, the Harry Potter game a lot of people are still talking about.

106
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I know we went into that in depth last week and I don't want to rehash too much.

107
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,000
But I know a lot of people are still, you know, out there finding the foundables.

108
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Finding the findables.

109
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
And some of my friends in Reno that I hung out with this weekend.

110
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:23,000
So the other reason why it was nice to go to Reno is because I have friends up there that I don't get to see as often as maybe the ones in San Francisco.

111
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,000
So I went up to Reno and one of my friends there was like, oh yeah, I'm playing that Harry Potter game. I love it.

112
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:35,000
And I mentioned that I played Ingress and I was like, you have like a little picnic area like right by where you live that probably would be in Ingress.

113
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Do you want me to submit that so you have like a Harry Potter thing by your house?

114
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
He's like, oh my gosh, yes, would you? So I did. I sent it.

115
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
So we'll see if it goes, fingers crossed, if it goes through or not.

116
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:52,000
But yeah, he's all into the Harry Potter game, which is interesting because I thought most people were kind of just detouring from Pokemon Go for that.

117
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,000
But I don't know, maybe Harry Potter has its own audience. I'm not sure.

118
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Probably. There's still a lot of crossover, I would think.

119
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Harry Potter had a big event on Saturday though, but so did Pokemon Go.

120
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
So Harry Potter had an event in the morning.

121
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Like, I don't think, I don't know if I would call it their version of a community day, but they did a little thing for a few hours where it was like increased spawns and all this stuff.

122
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:17,000
And then Pokemon Go had their Raikou raids because we could see them go.

123
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:22,000
We were like at the casino, like waiting to get into the VIP thing for Carly Rae.

124
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,000
And we could see like, you could see the gyms like on the outside of the casino, but they were nowhere near us.

125
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
And we're like, well, guess we're missing Raikou day.

126
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,000
But it sounds like a lot more people were getting shinies, like they increased the percentage.

127
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I know I was keeping an eye on our Discord at vognetwork.com slash Discord.

128
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
We actually have a Pokemon Go channel because enough of you play it.

129
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:43,000
And I was like, a lot of people were saying they've got multiple shinies on the Raikou days. That's cool.

130
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I just feel like I feel like I'm getting that point where I'm like, oh, I'm slipping on Pokemon Go and I'm falling behind.

131
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:54,000
And I don't know if it's like, am I going to allow myself to just completely fall off the wagon or what's going to happen?

132
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:59,000
And the fact that Harry Potter is like the new kid on the block doesn't help that situation.

133
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I don't know.

134
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
ActDeftInChat says, a friend in our group didn't get a shiny though.

135
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Well, but isn't that why the rest of you get three and four shinies?

136
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Like, so you can trade?

137
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I mean, maybe not right away, maybe the next, because what?

138
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
They're going to do one for the fire guy and the ice guy, right?

139
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I know you have to meet certain criteria, but they're going to do it.

140
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
You know, they're going to do it.

141
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
They'll find a way to do it.

142
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:26,000
So then the concept is, I guess, if you don't get any of the fire guy, but then your friend gets three of those, you trade.

143
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
That's what Pokemon is all about, right?

144
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Yeah.

145
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Hopefully someone will take pity on me and trade a Riku to me at some point.

146
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I'm not, I'm getting to the point where I'm not that torn up about it.

147
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I'm like, Oh, damn, I missed it.

148
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Those shinies are just taking up my inventory space anyway.

149
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
All right.

150
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Anyway.

151
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Well, you can get your shinies for the Lowens right now, can't you?

152
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Yeah.

153
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
That's the whole thing going on too.

154
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Anyway, it was supposed to be a kickoff about Final Fantasy 14, but it turned into multiplayer game discussion across the board.

155
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
So it's, I mean, in a way it is a busy summer.

156
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:04,000
These are things that people are doing this summer and maybe why the news is not so like, you know, huge headlines, you know, things we have to urgently talk about.

157
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:09,000
But we have a few stories this week about, um, games going to TV.

158
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
So do you want to take this or you want me to do it?

159
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
We can talk about it.

160
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:18,000
So Sony announced that they're going to be bringing Final Fantasy 14 to TV as like a Final Fantasy TV series.

161
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
That's kind of unexpected.

162
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Yeah.

163
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Like I'm, I'm really pleasantly surprised about this.

164
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I'm curious to see what it's like, but, um, I definitely wasn't expecting them to do that.

165
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:41,000
So it's going to be, I guess, a collaboration between Sony Pictures Television and Hive Mind Entertainment, which has done, or is going to be doing the adaptation of The Witcher.

166
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:46,000
And I guess there's a show called The Expanse on Amazon that they also helm as well.

167
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Oh, that show.

168
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
There's a lot of nerdy geeky fans of that show.

169
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I see a lot of it on Twitter.

170
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Um, don't they have nudity on that show in The Expanse or am I confusing them with another show?

171
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Somebody in chat knows.

172
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Fess up.

173
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:05,000
It's going to be so much shipping on the Final Fantasy show.

174
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I know.

175
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I'm like, you can do anything we want.

176
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
It's Netflix.

177
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Well, I don't even know if it's going to be on Netflix.

178
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
It didn't say what platform they're playing.

179
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I might be confusing them with another sci-fi show.

180
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Uh, but, you know.

181
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Are we going to get outed as a total perv?

182
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Uh, yeah, no real word other than, you know, what it's, it's going to be a struggle between magic and technology.

183
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
All the games, basically.

184
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Uh, to bring peace to a landing conflict.

185
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
All of the games.

186
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
It's basically like all of the games.

187
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Um, Tiger Claw in our chat says a live action series to be exact, and I think that is an important thing to note.

188
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
That is not CGI or cartoon or something.

189
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
That is a live action series.

190
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Um, and a lot of people talking about, oh, they've kind of done one already with the Dad of Light series that is on, um, Netflix.

191
00:12:53,000 --> 00:13:01,000
But in that show, and disclaimer, I haven't watched it, but, you know, just kind of been following what it was all about and the stories on that and the people that have seen it.

192
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:08,000
My understanding is that Final Fantasy XIV is a little bit more of a plot device where the show is really about this father and son relationship.

193
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:14,000
But the game is something that they kind of use to understand their own relationship.

194
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Whereas this is different because this is the game as a show.

195
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
This is not a plot device for something else.

196
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:26,000
And it's great because then maybe I'll understand what's going on with Final Fantasy XIV and then I can play the game, right?

197
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Is that, that's the goal.

198
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Okay, so we obviously have two very different kind of, you know, between you and I tonight.

199
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I play a lot of Final Fantasy XIV.

200
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I played shitty 1.0.

201
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I've played since the alpha of Realm Reborn and so forth.

202
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
And I've continued to play the game and I really enjoy it.

203
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Um, you played very little of the beta.

204
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Yeah, you played very little of the beta because you were a big fan of XI.

205
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,000
But you were like, no more monthly fee games pretty much, right?

206
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Yeah, I can't really do that because it's just, I don't play enough.

207
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:04,000
And I think there's a lot of people in your boat where like people are like, I would play Final Fantasy XIV if I didn't have to pay every month to play it.

208
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
I think there's a lot of people in that boat.

209
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Um, but I can tell you as somebody who does play the game and I kind of justify the monthly fee.

210
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Although I realize it's feeling a little more dated as, you know, we have so much more like free to play stuff with it's powered by, you know, cosmetic items and things like that.

211
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:30,000
But I kind of justify the monthly expense because I feel like they've been really good about regularly patching the content like every few months.

212
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
It's like you get this new DLC if you want to say it that way.

213
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:38,000
They call it patches in the MMO world, especially new dungeons, new things to explore, new parts of the story.

214
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
So it's like they're doing DLC every few months.

215
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
And so I go, okay, well, it's expensive DLC, but I'm kind of paying for that.

216
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,000
And just the fact that, you know, it isn't always online game.

217
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:58,000
But to that effect though, so are a lot of these other games as service games like Destiny 2 and stuff like that are doing regular content updates as well.

218
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
So it's like it's not really exclusive to them.

219
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:07,000
I would also just rather pay the honest, you know, twelve ninety five or whatever.

220
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
I'm actually paying quarterly, so I don't even know how much I pay, but whatever it is a monthly.

221
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:19,000
I would rather pay that honest fee up front than like get fucked over by loot boxes like the last Star Wars battle.

222
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,000
So, yeah, I would rather it just be an honest like this is how much we want to charge.

223
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
See, if it was an EA game, they'd be charging at twelve ninety five a month.

224
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Plus the loot boxes as well in there.

225
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Black Mama 1977 in our chat with a sad but important point that they never finished out of light because the dad in the show passed away.

226
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
And, you know, so, you know, that show can't really continue.

227
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
You know, I highly doubt they're going to continue it with a different actor or anything.

228
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
So it's time to go somewhere else with Final Fantasy 14.

229
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
But again, you know, this is going to be something that's actually set in the universe.

230
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:54,000
And so but it is not an adaptation of the story in game right now, is my understanding.

231
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,000
It's going to be in the universe, but it's going to be like a different story.

232
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,000
And I don't know if it's like prequel or any of that.

233
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
I don't know if they're saying a lot about that.

234
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Act deft and chat over Twitch TV slash Vogue Network is very excited about live action chocobos.

235
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,000
So I know that's that's a thing that people be looking for.

236
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Well, it's all going to be like CG stuff.

237
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
I mean, they're going to. Sure.

238
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:23,000
We have like the computer anime movie that they did for 13 not too long goes.

239
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Oh, no, 15, not 13, 15.

240
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:33,000
So, yeah, the CGI technology is there to have real people writing, you know, the fake chocobos.

241
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
They're not going to do it all the time.

242
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
It's going to be one of those like big moments in the show.

243
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
And then they're not going to have people writing chocobos like all the time.

244
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I doubt we'll see. I don't know.

245
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
I'd be curious to see what service this is going to be on.

246
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Oh, if you think it's going to end up being a Netflix thing or heaven forbid, is Sony going to launch their own service?

247
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Well, they have crackle, right? Or whatever it is they have.

248
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Well, not as a crackle, but they have like they're they've tried to do TV shows on the PlayStation stuff before.

249
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Remember, there's the whole that was it the tester was that was called or I don't I can't see this being a PlayStation Network exclusive.

250
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
It's just not going to get enough eyes unless.

251
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
OK, y'all y'all want a tinfoil hat.

252
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:21,000
What if they're doing something with PlayStation five where they're going to as much as the whole like TV, TV, TV, sports, sports, TV, TV.

253
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
And look how well that worked for Microsoft.

254
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,000
But what if they're kind of planning to do something on PlayStation five?

255
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Where maybe this will be one of the offerings that they put out there, like if you get a PlayStation five, you have access to Sony TV.

256
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:40,000
That's going to have these other shows like now a PlayStation plus included with your plus membership.

257
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:50,000
And then my reaction will be, oh, no, I can only watch it if I buy a PlayStation five, except the Internet exists, and therefore I will pirate it.

258
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Or like what's happening to Star Trek Discovery in other countries.

259
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:00,000
It's on Netflix, so they don't have to worry about the whole CBS all access thing like we do here in the States.

260
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:12,000
The second season, which I haven't finished, but the second season is like apparently like if you thought the first season was not Star Trek enough, the second season will address your concerns.

261
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
That's what I'm told without sounding.

262
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,000
I don't know. I've seen some clips that look pretty cringy.

263
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
OK, but you can go back to old Star Trek and there's a lot of clips that look really cringy.

264
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Yeah, but there's different there's different cringe.

265
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:27,000
There's cringe like, you know, it's old and that's kind of how we did things and stuff.

266
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Then there's cringe like where we're taking CSI type, you know, technobabble and throwing it into Star Trek.

267
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
And it's just weird.

268
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
It's always the starboard power coupling. Am I right, guys?

269
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
I read that show. All right.

270
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Some other comments from chat pod culture reminding us Powers was the other show on PlayStation.

271
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
That was the year I was at Sony's press conference, the year they unveiled that.

272
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
I should know that better.

273
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
That's right. Yeah, I didn't care about that.

274
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Yeah, I think a lot of people forgot about that.

275
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Oops. Let's see.

276
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Also, Tiger Claw talking about the Final Fantasy 14 show in our chat saying, I'm curious about the production value.

277
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,000
It's going to be live action, but there will be CGI in it for sure.

278
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Well, you know, I think, you know, like what they did in 1993 or four,

279
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:16,000
whatever it was with Jurassic Park is much easier to do for a lot of people now.

280
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,000
I mean, the best example I could say is like, look at those Sharknado movies.

281
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:25,000
OK, those Sharknado movies are extremely low budget, right?

282
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Yet they do CGI effects.

283
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Well, OK, let's not say it's going to be that bad CGI.

284
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
They could do it.

285
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:39,000
There's I think now it's easier to do a lot of that stuff and you can make the effects look better,

286
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
but you can't also rely heavily on it.

287
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
You have to have good writing as well.

288
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:49,000
So I think that we're probably in for a pretty decent show and it's a pretty exciting.

289
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:55,000
We've got this The Witcher. There's that Rainbow or was it a Ghost Recon

290
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
or Rainbow Six show that was supposed to be coming out or something like that.

291
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Oh, yeah. Tom Clancy.

292
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Yeah. I mean, it's pretty exciting.

293
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
They were getting all these like video game properties.

294
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Not Sonic, but all the other stuff is very exciting.

295
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,000
I mean, we just had like Detective Pikachu and that was an amazing show.

296
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,000
I will still watch Sonic, but my bar is really low.

297
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Have you ever seen that meme that's like the nine squares?

298
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Yes.

299
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
And it goes like, thank you for.

300
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
So I feel like you're setting up.

301
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
That's exactly what I was thinking.

302
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Where it's like Final Fantasy 14.

303
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Thank and then like maybe the new Tomb Raider movie you for bringing video games in that center square.

304
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Not you with the Sonic.

305
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
You guys know that meme I'm talking about.

306
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Yes, I know.

307
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
I know exactly what you mean.

308
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
And that's exactly what I was thinking.

309
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Not you.

310
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Yeah, pretty much.

311
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
It'll you know what?

312
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
I will enjoy it for what it is.

313
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
I'm sure it's going to be absolute garbage.

314
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
And I love I can't wait.

315
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
They pushed it back.

316
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
It's going to be tweaked.

317
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Let's give it a let's give it.

318
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
I want it to be absolute garbage.

319
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:04,000
It needs to be absolute garbage because that's going to make it super entertaining.

320
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
All right. Anyway, a few more notes of Final Fantasy 14.

321
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Then we'll move on.

322
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:15,000
I do think that, you know, I completely respect why people don't want to pay the monthly fee to play Final Fantasy 14.

323
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Especially if they don't have as many hours in the day to be able to play the game.

324
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:23,000
So they feel like I'm wasting my money because it's maybe something I'm only going to be able to play on the weekend or something.

325
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
But I will say this.

326
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:29,000
The story in Final Fantasy 14 is really good.

327
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:37,000
I to be fair, I don't think it really gets really good until you kind of get up to like the end of Realm Reborn.

328
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Because I do feel like the game kind of has to get through like the leveling process where you get to level 50 and like a lot of tutorial and set up and, you know, learning about this mechanic and that mechanic.

329
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,000
And so it does feel like you're doing a lot of fetch quests and stuff.

330
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:56,000
But once you start to get into the part after they had to fix what was broken and get into our new shit.

331
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:03,000
And they did that with the end of Realm Reborn and they especially did that with Heaven's Word and Stormblood.

332
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:08,000
And I'm assuming this new one. I haven't played enough, you know, if the story is phenomenal yet.

333
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,000
But, you know, Heaven's Word and Stormblood are excellent stories.

334
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Like honestly, in my opinion, some may disagree and I've said this before.

335
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Heaven's Word and Stormblood are some of the strongest Final Fantasy stories in the entire series.

336
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:27,000
And hardly any of you know it because that monthly fee holds you back.

337
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Which again, I completely understand.

338
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:33,000
And I know it's unreasonable because I pay like small monthly fees for a whole bunch of shit.

339
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,000
And so it's like, what's one more thing?

340
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:45,000
I mean, it's just, I don't want to feel tied down to playing one game all the time when I don't have enough time to play all of the games that I have in my backlog.

341
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:50,000
So it's like, you know, I would feel obligated to play that one game so much.

342
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Now, SSTO 100 Matt in chat says,

343
00:22:52,000 --> 00:23:06,000
It's truly an amazing, I'm assuming an amazing accomplishment, that a game that needed to completely wipe and reset after a bad initial release was able to come back from it to become a fantastic game that is now being considered for a live action series.

344
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Speaks to how much of an amazing comeback story this has been.

345
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Oh, absolutely. And the comeback kid is like this new thing in video games, right?

346
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:19,000
You know, between this and Diablo 3 and Destiny to some extent.

347
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:27,000
And I think what EA would really wish would happen to Anthem, but, you know, they're going to need to back it up a little bit, but we'll see.

348
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Here's the problem, EA. You're EA.

349
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Oh, No Man's Sky. Thank you, Dr. Seeya. Excellent, excellent example.

350
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:37,000
And also, EA, you have to make the game good in order for it to, you know, be worthy of stuff.

351
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Well, no. I mean, they'll have to eventually, but it doesn't have to be good now.

352
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:45,000
I know that sounds crazy, but look at Final Fantasy XIV 1.0. It wasn't good.

353
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Like, there's just no other nice way for me to say it. Final Fantasy XIV 1.0 wasn't good, and now it's great.

354
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:58,000
So, I mean, they can hopefully fix some of those issues, but is EA willing to put in the time and effort? History has shown, no, they're not going to.

355
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
They will shut down BioWare before they do that.

356
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:05,000
If they're going to change their tune, great. Let's see them do it. You know what I mean?

357
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:13,000
So, anyway. Alright, so Final Fantasy XIV series, I am, like, super looking forward to it as a fan of Final Fantasy.

358
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:20,000
I'll be very curious to hear more about, like, who's writing, directing the specific episodes, and who's starring, you know?

359
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Are they going to get, like, big talent in this? Or is it going to be, like, you know, unknowns and hoping that the final...

360
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Which is fine, you know, unknowns. There's, you know, maybe they're unknowns, but then they get discovered.

361
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:36,000
But I'll be very curious if they lure, like, some big names to this. This will be very interesting, huh?

362
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Keanu Reeves is Sid.

363
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Keanu Reeves is Sid. Who knows? Anything's possible. So, alright, anyway.

364
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Let's move on, and Nifty805 says they should put Michelle Yeoh in it.

365
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:51,000
She's cool. There's a lot of people they could put in it, and I would be, like, super happy.

366
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:55,000
So it's one of those things where, just, let's get some more details.

367
00:24:55,000 --> 00:25:01,000
But I wouldn't expect we're going to see a frame from this thing until 2021.

368
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Right? How long ago did we hear about The Witcher? It was a while ago.

369
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
I think it was last year, I think.

370
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
And it's still not out. And we've only seen, what, like...

371
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
I think it's supposed to be out this year, though.

372
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Is it later this year?

373
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
I think so.

374
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Okay, well then maybe we'll see something fall next year. It just depends.

375
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:19,000
But I would expect we don't see a frame until 2021. But we'll see.

376
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Anyway, let's move on to, how was your gaming week?

377
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,000
And the types of video games that you've been playing this week.

378
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:29,000
And I'm laughing a little bit because I know we do a video game podcast.

379
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,000
But we try to play as many games as we can in our spare time.

380
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
I don't know if we have a lot this week.

381
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Loki, what are you up to this week?

382
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:41,000
I'm sorry, I'm bad. I've had a stressful week. It's getting better.

383
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,000
So I'm hoping to play more games next week.

384
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:48,000
I did play a little bit of Pokemon Go this week while I was out doing things.

385
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,000
And that was pretty much it, unfortunately.

386
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Most of the time has been spent watching Awesome Games Done Quicks.

387
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,000
Or Summer Games Done Quick, I should say.

388
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,000
To be fair, I bet a lot of people would say that.

389
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,000
I didn't game myself this week because I was watching SGDQ.

390
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Because it's a big thing in the gaming community.

391
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
I mean, I picked up some games.

392
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,000
I bought Mario Maker 2 because my kids wanted to play it.

393
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
You said they played it and you watched it a little bit, right?

394
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
They said that they were bored with it.

395
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Or they're not bored with it.

396
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
But they said it's not as good as the first one.

397
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,000
But I don't know. They don't know what the hell they're talking about.

398
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
They're kids!

399
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:27,000
I take that back. I did play a tiny little bit of Mario and the Rabbids Kingdom Battle.

400
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Because my son wanted me to beat a level for him.

401
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
And so I had to do that a little bit.

402
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
I still haven't played through that game. I probably should.

403
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
And then...

404
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:41,000
What else? Oh, I picked up Moshpit Simulator on PC for VR.

405
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Because my son wanted that as well.

406
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
And also that looks like stupid.

407
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
And I kind of want to play it as well.

408
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:51,000
I've been looking through the Steam sales stuff to see if there's anything I want to pick up.

409
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,000
There hasn't been a whole lot of things that I...

410
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
I put a few things in my cart and I'm like,

411
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
I'm not going to play that. What am I buying?

412
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Or what am I even trying to buy that for?

413
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Just Cause 4. I'm not playing that.

414
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,000
I haven't played through Just Cause 3. What am I going to pick that up for?

415
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
So, you know, stuff like that.

416
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,000
So I've been just kind of holding myself back from purchasing things.

417
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Worked on my game a little bit for a couple hours the other day.

418
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
So he did that.

419
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Son finally graduated to Yellowbelt in his coding stuff.

420
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
So now he's going to be doing JavaScript.

421
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,000
So that's pretty cool. Outside of just, like, Scratch.

422
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
So he's got that for a couple more belts.

423
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
And yeah.

424
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
And I've been just doing my stuff.

425
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
I keep getting questions, though, from their...

426
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,000
They call them their senseis or whatever.

427
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,000
The kids that teach them, help them with stuff.

428
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,000
About, like, so you can put your game on Steam.

429
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
What's it called?

430
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
So I'm like, dude, it's still in the prototype phase.

431
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:51,000
We're not even talking about platforms and shit until I get something that resembles a game.

432
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:55,000
But it's getting more and more like a game every day.

433
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Nice. Alright. Anything else?

434
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
That's it.

435
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,000
So my gaming week was pretty sad this week.

436
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,000
I meant to pick up Mario Maker, but I got so sidetracked.

437
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:11,000
So I had a big personal issue that came up this week that really took my attention.

438
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
And it was, like, extremely stressful.

439
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,000
And yeah, so I'm not going to get into details.

440
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
It's not worth going over on a video game podcast.

441
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:24,000
But just needless to say, my attention was completely diverted with that for a couple of nights this week.

442
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
And some of the time I would have been playing video games.

443
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:33,000
But when I wasn't, like, with that situation or with work or something,

444
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:38,000
another thing that's been taking up quite a bit of my time is, and I don't know, Loki, you might laugh or whatever,

445
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:42,000
but I signed up to play another one of those online reality games.

446
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,000
I'm playing another survivor-y type of game online.

447
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:49,000
So in fact, the guys running it were kind of like, you didn't say anything on your podcast last week.

448
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:54,000
So I'll say something this week. And I'm even doing it for free.

449
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:58,000
So I'm playing a game called Power ORG because ORG is what they call a lot of these things.

450
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
So ORG is online reality game.

451
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
So it's like a survivor-y type of clone.

452
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,000
I played one of these about a year ago, like another big one.

453
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,000
And so I've talked about this a little bit on the show before.

454
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
But basically, it's pretty elaborate.

455
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Like, there's people that work on putting it together and having like a legit…

456
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,000
So obviously you're not stranded on a desert island.

457
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
You're trying to live your freaking life, right?

458
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:27,000
But when I come home from work, it's like there might be a challenge that we have to look at tonight.

459
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,000
Or there might be a tribal council coming up.

460
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:37,000
So you've got to try to chat with people or talk with people or whatever to try to make sure that it's not going to be you that gets voted out and that whole thing.

461
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,000
But you guys know that I've been listening to show for a long time.

462
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,000
I've always kind of had a soft spot for those type of games.

463
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Well, here's the thing. I've loved game shows all the time since I was a kid, right?

464
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
I grew up on the match game, right? And that type of stuff.

465
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
And pressure lock and all that shit, right?

466
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:55,000
So when it kind of got fused with reality TV, when Survivor first started, what?

467
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
It's going to be like 20 years ago, right?

468
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Yeah.

469
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
I kind of was really into that now.

470
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:04,000
It's interesting because I don't watch the TV shows as much now.

471
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:09,000
But it doesn't mean I don't think the game is kind of fun. It's kind of neat.

472
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:13,000
But I always forget what a time sink it can be until I kind of get into it.

473
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:19,000
And part of the reason I agreed to do it is because I'd been asked to do some other games.

474
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:23,000
I had to keep saying no because I knew I'd be gone for a week.

475
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:26,000
I'm going to Chicago for a week and it's in the middle of the game. I can't do it.

476
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,000
I'm going to a convention. I'm going to Dragon Con. I'm going to whatever.

477
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:35,000
And if you agree to do this, you want to realistically know that you're going to have six weeks

478
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:38,000
where you can kind of actually be there to play the game.

479
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:43,000
But a nice little time period here kind of worked out where it's the end of June.

480
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
And this is, I think, supposed to go through mid-August.

481
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:49,000
So it's right up against then Dragon Con so it won't get in the way.

482
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
So I was like, okay, the timing works out.

483
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,000
I know some of the people that are putting it together.

484
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,000
I'd met through the community so I'm like, what the hell? I'll do it.

485
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:01,000
And then I'm like, oh, shit, now I haven't played any video games this week because of it.

486
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:09,000
Kudos to the ORG community in general that's very passionate and stuff about it.

487
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
It's pretty impressive.

488
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,000
They actually did a little, oh, I should have pulled it and showed it on the show.

489
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
You guys would have cracked up.

490
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:20,000
They actually did a little fakey-fake introduction that looks like the show.

491
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:24,000
So we had to go out and shoot ourselves doing something in nature.

492
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:30,000
And then a little turn and face the camera type of shot where it's like, face the camera, that type of thing.

493
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Like they kind of do on the show.

494
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Although mine's a little more serious than that.

495
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:39,000
But then a guy actually put it all together and put a little theme music and it's super cute.

496
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:43,000
So it's amazing what fans can do, don't you think?

497
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
Yeah.

498
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,000
That's right.

499
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:53,000
And now it's going to take something like that being put on Twitch on a regular basis.

500
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Oh, I'm sure it's been on Twitch somewhere.

501
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:02,000
People stream themselves playing like Werewolf and Mafia and that kind of stuff.

502
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:07,000
These things are just like the next step past that.

503
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:11,000
So like an underground survivor type show.

504
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:19,000
Several people I've met doing these things have done a thing called Sequester, which is like a YouTube show.

505
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,000
And I think that's another big thing.

506
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:29,000
Like fan shows, I know there's a big one, Survivor Maryland, Survivor Boston.

507
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:35,000
And so they do like a lot of college campuses have like a Survivor Club or something like that.

508
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:39,000
And they do like a fakey-fake version of the show and they put it on YouTube.

509
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:45,000
And I guess for whatever reason, the production company behind Survivor is cool with it because I've never seen them try to shut that type of stuff down.

510
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
But I mean, it's kind of free advertising for the brand.

511
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
That show's been on for 20 years.

512
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:55,000
I don't think they were like, well, people want to watch the Survivor Philadelphia version more than like whatever.

513
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,000
OK, so I'm getting questions in chat about this.

514
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:04,000
So S2100 Matt says, is Rob the character that isn't there to make friends and will do what he wants?

515
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Well, now I can't give away my strategy on air because I don't know who's watching.

516
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:14,000
But no, I I wouldn't play the games if I didn't genuinely enjoy meeting the people.

517
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:20,000
And I like the last game I played, I met somebody that lived here in the same town that I do.

518
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:24,000
And we actually like we hang out once a month, like we're legit like friends.

519
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:28,000
So he lasted a lot longer in the game than I did. But like we're legit friends. We hang out.

520
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:34,000
I actually want to do an episode of OLR one night where we bring some of those guys, because there's a few of them that live here, bring some of them over.

521
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:38,000
And we have like an ORG night on the show, kind of like we did the Ingers night a few months ago.

522
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,000
That's ORG, not ORG.

523
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:49,000
ORG. I'm not violating the online reality game. ORG. I'm not violating the Twitch terms of service by having an ORG.

524
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:55,000
OK, it's different. All right. Anyway, what was the other question I saw in chat here?

525
00:33:55,000 --> 00:34:02,000
Oh, Nifty 105 says, Rob Roberts is not the silky. He's probably more like the Ben De La Creme.

526
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:07,000
Those are Drag Race references. Let's see. I don't know what what. Oh, you know.

527
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Now, here's the here's the here's the real tea. You ready? I'm the Charlie Hides.

528
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:21,000
Because I'm like the only one that's like 40, like a lot of them to play are like mid 20s, late 20s, maybe a few early 30s.

529
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:27,000
Like one of the people I met here in town is like maybe 33, I think. So, yeah, no, I'm definitely like that.

530
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:31,000
And yeah, I'm very much the how do you do fellow kids like that's yeah.

531
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:37,000
But that's because I started this whole thing years ago on LiveJournal when I was 28.

532
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
They were doing these things back on LiveJournal then, too.

533
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:44,000
And then it was one of my friends from back in those days that was like, did you know these are still going on?

534
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:48,000
But they all play on Skype now and not AOL. It's a messenger. I'm like, what? Tell me more.

535
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:52,000
And then, yeah, I played one. I was like, OK, this is fun. It's really stressful, but it's fun.

536
00:34:52,000 --> 00:35:00,000
So, cool. There you go. All right. I spent way too much time on that topic, except for maybe the couple of people from that community that will be listening to this who will probably get a kick out of that.

537
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:10,000
So there you go. You can you can look it up on Facebook. There's your free promo for Power Orgy, not Power Orgy, or you're going to get something completely different.

538
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:15,000
Just a warning. All right. So that's it for our gaming leaks.

539
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:18,000
Yeah, it's still it's still a game. What I'm doing, it's just not a video game.

540
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:24,000
Yeah, it's a different type of game. So it's it's fucking LARPing is what it is.

541
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:30,000
It's it's fucking LARPing. It is. It's more respectable LARPing, I guess.

542
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:35,000
Oh, why? Thank you. It's LARPing without the effort.

543
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:42,000
It's LARPing, except you are kind of being yourself unless you want to be a character, I guess. I don't know. Anyway.

544
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:47,000
S.J. 100 Matt says it's LARPing without yelling out spells. I had some of the challenges.

545
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:50,000
I don't know. I don't know. All right. Let's move on. New topic. All right.

546
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:55,000
Let's get into some gaming news and some things that have been going on around the video game world this week.

547
00:35:55,000 --> 00:36:00,000
Loki, start us off. They got LARPing and ingress, isn't a thing? I don't know.

548
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:06,000
I don't know. So anyways, there's yeah, there's a steam sale going on in case you weren't aware.

549
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:11,000
And Valve has been doing this thing where they have it's kind of like a racing theme.

550
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:20,000
So they've got five teams that you can pick to join and basing based on certain challenges,

551
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:28,000
you purchasing games and I think doing other things, it helps boost your team ahead and and everybody's team corgi.

552
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:33,000
So it doesn't matter anyways. You just pick team corgi and then you might win something.

553
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:40,000
Basically, I think every day or every so often they will see who's going to win.

554
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:45,000
And based on that, some people might win their top wish list game.

555
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:56,000
But there was some confusion what you had to do to actually be able to win some stuff.

556
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:07,000
So what people have done is they've thought that they had to remove games from their wish list in order to boost the chance that they're going to win the one that they want.

557
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:15,000
And that's unfortunately caused some issues where that they have removed like some people that had indie games out there.

558
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:22,000
They're like, we saw a huge drop in all the people that had our game on their wish list because we were a five dollar indie game.

559
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:28,000
Yeah. So, you know, unfortunately, that was kind of one of the things.

560
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:33,000
Also, there has been I guess in this one, though, you can't actually get like trading cards.

561
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:41,000
It's just earning different things from this whole event. I stopped caring about that stuff a long time ago.

562
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:46,000
I just been looking at some of the stuff that's on sale, which is a few things I want.

563
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,000
Definitely not as like deep cuts in.

564
00:37:49,000 --> 00:38:01,000
And also now that the sales are kind of the same, I think every single day, as far as I'm aware, it's less of that coming back to like, oh, what's on sale today or what's on sale right now?

565
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:04,000
You know, these flash sales and stuff like that. Oh, a better wait.

566
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,000
And, you know, that was more interesting and more traffic to the site, I think.

567
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:10,000
But now it's just kind of. I don't know.

568
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:14,000
So like they were saying, here's some of the quotes we had from different developers.

569
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:21,000
So they were saying that Yitz, who is, I guess, a developer of a game called Neffing and the Dark or to the Dark Tower,

570
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:30,000
basically saying that most indies who we're talking to at least are losing more money from the Steam's or Steam's cut than from taking in from visibility.

571
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:35,000
I and many other devs are currently losing money from being hosted on Steam.

572
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:45,000
And of course, Valve is apologizing, saying we designed something pretty complicated, a whole bunch of numbers and rules and recognize we should have been more clear.

573
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:52,000
We want to apologize for the confusion that this has caused and apologize for the broken mechanics that have led to unbalanced event.

574
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:59,000
So the TLDR of that is be Team Corgi because you're going to win every time.

575
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:04,000
Yeah, I as somebody told me about that and said, just go pick Corgi.

576
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:09,000
So I logged in and did that. But then it was like, oh, you got to play these games to get the achievement and all this stuff.

577
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:14,000
And I'm like, I'd love to do this. But, you know, the other thing I signed up for going on.

578
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:19,000
And even when I'm not doing that, I didn't even talk about during my gaming week. So I guess I'll just sneak it in here.

579
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:23,000
I did touch that Final Fantasy 14 expansion, at least for a few hours.

580
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:28,000
And so I haven't gotten enough into the story, but I will say it's fucking gorgeous.

581
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:36,000
Like the whole concept of it to start is that you go into this. I don't want to call it the upside down because that's like you.

582
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,000
Dynamics.

583
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:41,000
It would make you think, well, it's like you go to like an alternate reality of the world.

584
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:47,000
They call it the first. But you go to like an alternate reality world where like you end up there in the first guy you meet.

585
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:50,000
It's like super bright out. And he goes, what are you doing here this time of night?

586
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:54,000
Even though it's like super bright out. And so you kind of get the sense that like things are off.

587
00:39:54,000 --> 00:40:01,000
And in this world, light has ruined things. So that's kind of like the whole setup.

588
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:07,000
So the world looks very different and it's gorgeous. So, yeah, I played that for a few hours.

589
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:14,000
I ran a dungeon that was nothing but dancers and gun breakers and me, the astrologian, because I was trying to get a feel for my job.

590
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:18,000
And they made healing a lot harder. Boy, because they've shuffled all the skills and all this stuff.

591
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:22,000
So it was fun. But it's just like, oh, I got to reorient and like remember things.

592
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:27,000
I'm sure there's going to be some balancing patches. I'm sure of it. But I enjoyed what I played a FOM SE 14 so far.

593
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,000
Cool.

594
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:34,000
So, yeah, there's that anyway. So that's part of the reason why I didn't do the achievements in the steam sale and all that other stuff.

595
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:40,000
But I will point out the number one thing on my steam wish list is like a one hundred dollar game development program.

596
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:47,000
Would I actually win that if I won something on steam or are they going to say like a maximum is 60 bucks and something else?

597
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:51,000
I'm not going to win anything because there's so many millions of people on steam.

598
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:57,000
It just doesn't. Who cares? Oh, no, I won't get a free game that will go into my library.

599
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:01,000
That will never play. Oh, geez. Oh, darn.

600
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:05,000
Why we are in our chat says, yeah, I won't have much time to play during the steam sale either.

601
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:15,000
I don't even have enough time to put together a 10 anniversary video last week because why we are developed games and has a few over the past 10 years from video clips and voiceovers that I already had recorded.

602
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:22,000
Well, yeah. You know, life happens, right? Day jobs get in the way. That's what happens. Yeah. So anyhow.

603
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:30,000
Yeah. So if you haven't already gone in on the steam sale, you might want to just check your wish list because maybe there's something on there you want to get when it's on sale.

604
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:34,000
And, you know, go go check out the race thing, even though it's a really weird mechanic.

605
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:38,000
Like if you wanted me to explain how that race works, I really can't. Yeah.

606
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:45,000
Can anyone in chat like summarize how does the race thing even work? Is it just like the more achievements your team unlocks, the further you go in the race?

607
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:51,000
I think it's also like you buy stuff and you get points, which is weird because I bought stuff, but I couldn't apply points to anything.

608
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:58,000
So I guess my purchase didn't count. Not that I care, but I know.

609
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:05,000
Yeah, I did notice like all the things that were like spending points on like a lot of it was like themes and mode icons and that type of stuff that you'd usually get from the trading cards.

610
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:12,000
So, yeah. And I was like, OK, it's not the end of the world. I didn't even know what like I was just looking at some different things that are in there.

611
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:18,000
And I don't know. I'll probably I'm looking for like some cheap VR games, you know, so that that was kind of one thing.

612
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:23,000
And then there's just some stuff that I've had on my wish list for a while that I was looking at.

613
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:27,000
I thought about just cause for but like I seriously I have just caused three on PlayStation four.

614
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:31,000
I've not played that game. And four I hear is not that great anyways.

615
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:37,000
Oh, how much is six down to. That's a that's a great game there.

616
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:42,000
Oh, twenty nine ninety nine. That's twenty five percent. That's the DLC only gathering storm.

617
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:49,000
Oh, yeah. Yeah. You pick that up actually. So maybe I'll do it. I know it's guys half off blood scenes. Ten percent.

618
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:52,000
I know why we are is explaining a little better what the sales all about.

619
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:59,000
Chat say you can buy stuff to increase the max number of points you can earn to actually earn the points.

620
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:03,000
You complete the quest and or unlock achievements in the steam games.

621
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:07,000
So I mean, what it is, you actually have to play games, Loki. No.

622
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:13,000
And then the team with the most points wins, a.k.a. corgi wins because everybody loves corgis.

623
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:17,000
I'm not even a dog person and I think corgis are so fucking cute.

624
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:21,000
Yeah. So I mean, it's the way it is. Let's see.

625
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:28,000
S.S.U. 100 Matt with an interesting perspective as well in our chat at Twitch TV slash Vogue Network says Prime Day is in a few weeks.

626
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:32,000
So I might just wait for that. That's true. There are other sales.

627
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:42,000
I am waiting for Prime Day because I have a thing I got from my job, which is it's like a gift card servicing.

628
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:47,000
So you can redeem it for any type of gift card or most different gift cards.

629
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:53,000
I usually put it towards Amazon. So it's like 100 bucks towards Amazon on Prime Day, which I don't know the hell I'd buy, though.

630
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:58,000
I bought a 4K TV last year. I bought a VR headset just recently.

631
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:01,000
I saw what the hell am I going to need? I still don't have a 4K TV.

632
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:09,000
Like I'm tempted, but at the same time, like we need to spend money on more important things and responsibility.

633
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:15,000
Like a few hundred bucks. I guess that's true. I'm tempted, but the longer you wait, the cheaper they get.

634
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:19,000
That's true. So maybe I'll maybe I'll wait for like the holiday sales. Maybe it'll make a little more sense.

635
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:23,000
Because if you don't need it right away, there's I have 4K on my computer.

636
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:29,000
So, you know, again, I do more kind of there. How about you buy a new graphics card for your computer then?

637
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:33,000
That's honestly I wouldn't mind if I can find a good deal on something.

638
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:40,000
Well, they have the new super the GTX super cards that are coming or RTX super cards,

639
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:47,000
which are they're like they're a new set of graphics cards, but they're also going to be dropping the price of their older ones as well.

640
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:51,000
So you might look into that. It's going to happen in a couple weeks.

641
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:57,000
Yeah. Is Bitcoin mining still a problem with availability of those?

642
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:03,000
I think it's kind of dipped down because the price of Bitcoin has gone down, although it is going back up.

643
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:08,000
So it's not as bad as it used to be. Gotcha. All right.

644
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:13,000
As Stu 100 Matt says, Shane will use his hero's power to talk Rob into something.

645
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:19,000
He's already tried along the lines of, are you really playing another online game?

646
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:24,000
Just quit that game and come play Final Fantasy 14. And I'm like, no, I have too much.

647
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:28,000
If I say I'm going to do something, I'm going to do it. So, you know, but we'll see.

648
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:34,000
Anyway, we'll see how long it lasts for me anyway.

649
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:41,000
Moving on. Let's talk about the Final Fantasy 7 remake.

650
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:45,000
Final Fantasy 7, of course, is getting remade. We all know that.

651
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:50,000
And the remake is coming out March 20th, 2020.

652
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:56,000
I forgot the exact day, but it's in March. Do you remember the day?

653
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:59,000
I don't remember. I forgot the day. Somebody in chat would yell it out.

654
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:03,000
But anyway, it's starting to sound more and more like this first part of the Final Fantasy 7 remake.

655
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:09,000
I mean, it's like this is almost becoming its own Final Fantasy game, which I think we kind of saw coming a little bit.

656
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:13,000
The specifics this week that's coming out is about Materia.

657
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:18,000
So Materia is getting an overhaul, which kind of makes sense when you consider the battle system is different in the game.

658
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:24,000
Materia can't really work the exact same way because it's a little more action-based.

659
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:29,000
And so maybe the Materia being used on the spells and stuff is not really going to be the same thing.

660
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
So Materia is going to get a little bit of an overhaul.

661
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
We're going to use the draw system for me instead.

662
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:38,000
No, no. You still are going to slot Materia in weapons and all that stuff.

663
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:42,000
But Materia shows up on your party members when you equip it.

664
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:48,000
But yeah, it's going to change a little bit, so don't be used to the exact same way it worked before.

665
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:52,000
But you're going to have to use the special in-game currency to purchase your Materia.

666
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:56,000
Don't put that shit in the universe. Do not put that shit in the universe.

667
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:59,000
It'll be coming in a loot box that you can get your Materia in.

668
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:04,000
Well, what I'm also kind of curious about is that if this is only like Episode 1 or whatever,

669
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:10,000
and it only goes through the Midgar part, are we still going to get, even though it's like a 60-hour game still,

670
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:19,000
are we going to get the stages of fire, fura, fire aga, like the full evolution of magic

671
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
that you would see in a normal Final Fantasy game?

672
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:25,000
Or because it's only the first part of the game, we're only ever going to have fire?

673
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:29,000
Maybe fura, but that's it. It's never going to go for the full stages.

674
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:32,000
Are we going to be still kind of limited? Like you're not going to see Ultima in the game?

675
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:36,000
Or Summons? I don't think Summons came up until after Midgar. I can't remember. It's been a while.

676
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:40,000
And Aerith is still going to be alive.

677
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:45,000
In this game, yes. Because in Final Fantasy VII, the original, she does not pass until later on.

678
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
She passes to the end of this one.

679
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:51,000
There's going to be people that are actually surprised by that course of events.

680
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:57,000
Well, and as you said on a previous episode of the show, maybe Square will change it. That would be the real gag.

681
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:00,000
Cloud dies! Oh my god!

682
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:04,000
They're clearly taking liberties with the story.

683
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:09,000
And this is more and more feeling like, I don't want to say Final Fantasy XVI,

684
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:15,000
but this is definitely like every resource that would have been Final Fantasy XVI.

685
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:19,000
This is Final Fantasy XVI in how it plays and how it looks.

686
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:25,000
And now some of the mechanics almost sounds like it's just that the story is a retread.

687
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:29,000
A little bit. It's so interesting. It's Star Wars Episode VII.

688
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:33,000
They've resurrected the cow. We're getting ghost milk out of the cow now.

689
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:38,000
And they're just going to keep milking that cow until forever.

690
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:45,000
Questbuster says, wait, Aerith will live in this iteration? Guess I won't have to worry about finding a new healer then.

691
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:49,000
Well, it's only through Midgar, so if you remember the story,

692
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:55,000
Aerith doesn't die until later on in the story, after they're out in the world map.

693
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:58,000
It's a little bit later on. She dies at the end of disc one.

694
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:03,000
Maybe. So in this, she's not going to, unless, again, who knows if they're going to change.

695
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:07,000
Maybe they'll go the Tomb Raider route and she can die in lots of horrible ways.

696
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:13,000
Oh, Dark Sakura would love that. Aerith's no good, terrible, very bad day.

697
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
Yes. Yes.

698
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
So, let's see.

699
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:25,000
Questbuster also points out Materia will have, in quotes, surprise mechanics.

700
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:29,000
Not the EA type of surprise mechanics, I think we're hoping.

701
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:36,000
So anyway, I'm still, I mean, the folks I know that did go to E3 said, like, it's fun.

702
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:42,000
Like Final Fantasy 7 is fun. So it's going to be interesting, especially for the people that don't care for Final Fantasy 7,

703
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:46,000
because maybe people have hyped it up in history too much.

704
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:52,000
It's going to be interesting to see maybe what that group feels about this remake, because I imagine, you know,

705
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:57,000
most people are going to try this, whether they love the story or they hate the story, just because it's so different.

706
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:01,000
You know, and maybe, and because they've apparently taken some liberties with the story,

707
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
and maybe they're going to, you know, take some different branching paths.

708
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:06,000
And it's been so long anyways, I really don't remember much of the story.

709
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:09,000
I know, I don't either. I'm sure you can go read about it on Wikipedia, read the cliff notes and all that,

710
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:12,000
or go watch Advent Children to remember a good chunk of it.

711
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:16,000
But you're right. It's been so long that I'll probably go play this remake and go like,

712
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:20,000
okay, I remember a lot of that, even though, like, it's all new.

713
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:27,000
So, Kaijuto in chat says, I don't get the Aerith hate. I love that character.

714
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:34,000
You know, honestly, Kaijuto, like when I first played for, wow, my computer is playing an ad over here.

715
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:38,000
That's crazy. Anyway, thankfully this doesn't, this audio doesn't go on the feed anymore.

716
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
So it's just, it just scares me.

717
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:48,000
But yeah, when I first played Final Fantasy 7, I liked Aerith and I, because she was like my White Mage, my healer, right?

718
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:53,000
So I used her in the party. And so like when she got offed, I was like, it really was a huge shock.

719
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:56,000
Wow. She got her level four limit break. That's so convenient.

720
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
Why hasn't anybody else gotten their level four? Oh.

721
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:04,000
Yeah. And I was like, oh, I never got her level four limit break, but I was like, well, this is fucking irritating.

722
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:11,000
I've been leveling her for what? Because I kept thinking she'd come back and I'm like, oh, I guess, no, she, she dead.

723
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:16,000
So that was like frustrating for me. So I don't know if it's Aerith so much that I hate.

724
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:24,000
I, I still resent to this day the time I invested in her for nothing. I think that's what it is.

725
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:32,000
YYR in chat says, I'm one of those people. I liked Final Fantasy 7's characters, but I found the story to be meh and the gameplay to be disappointing.

726
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:36,000
So I'd love to see some improvements though. I won't have time to play it anyway. We'll see.

727
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:39,000
Anyway, let's move on some more stories. Loki.

728
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:46,000
All right. So let's talk a little bit more about TV again and another show that's going to be coming out.

729
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:52,000
So this is more along the lines of that one that they were talking about during the Ubisoft press conference where it's about game developers,

730
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:56,000
except these are actually about real game developers and not just like some imaginary company.

731
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:08,000
So this is an adaptation of a book called Masters of Doom that talks a little bit about how John Romero and John Carmack came together to create, of course, Doom.

732
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:15,000
And so it's a series, I guess, that's being produced by James and Dave Franco.

733
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:33,000
And yeah, it looks like it's just going to be an adaptation about how they formed id Software and how they kind of made that genre popularize the first person shooter genre.

734
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:41,000
I'm pretty excited about it. Apparently, it's expected to air on USA in twenty nineteen.

735
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:48,000
So. Yeah, I'm down. That sounds like it's really interesting.

736
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:56,000
Yeah, a little more of the it's like Silicon Valley, Silicon Valley, as I say, it sounds a little more like it's like the behind the scenes.

737
00:52:56,000 --> 00:53:00,000
So it's not really about the game. It's like they're making Doom a new TV show, which, you know, the movie was not great.

738
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:14,000
So good thing. But kind of like that development, which is it's it's neat because now we're really seeing like video games and the impact on culture, despite however you feel about the character, the particular people that are going to be portrayed or or this particular game.

739
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:24,000
It's really neat that like video game development is like a cultural thing that is worth representing in television and other art forms, if that makes sense.

740
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:33,000
Yeah, right. It looks cool. Yeah. So, yeah, I'll check it out. I'll watch the first episode, see what I think. Right. Yeah, I've watched that.

741
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:43,000
And I'm also very excited about that other show that unfortunately is going to be an Apple exclusive show that the one that's with the guys from It's Always Sunny doing that.

742
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:49,000
Oh, yeah. What is what what game? What is that one about? It's it's it's like a fake MMO type thing.

743
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:58,000
I don't remember what the show is actually called, but it's. I do want to check it out because of the folks in it, but.

744
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:05,000
Yeah. Oh, yeah. Well, because. Well, and the always sunny in Philadelphia thing like that has to be ending soon. That's been on for what, like 12 years.

745
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:11,000
I'm sure they want to go their own separate ways soon. You know, it's been on for a long time, although.

746
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:20,000
Yeah, some of them have gone off to do other shows, but I know like one of them, like APA Bio, is being canceled. So it's like, OK, what are you going to be doing now?

747
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:28,000
Siya Tiberian Chat says, don't forget USA knows drama, characters welcome. Yeah, it is interesting. I mean, USA is, you know, kind of pumped up its drama stuff.

748
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:36,000
So it's an interesting place for it to land. I think there's a lot of us that are kind of like, OK, so it'll air on USA. But but which digital service is going to get it?

749
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:44,000
Yeah, I know. Right. I think it's where a lot of us are. You think we're going to end up kind of back where we were like 10 years ago, where everything gets pirated?

750
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:52,000
Like you say, like, it's unfortunate this thing is going to Apple or it's unfortunate this thing is going to this service where it's like, I'm not going to pay for 17 different services.

751
00:54:52,000 --> 00:55:00,000
So it's like you think piracy, we're going to kind of end up right back there because these services will not work a little more collaboratively.

752
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:06,000
Yes. Yeah, I think that's exactly where we end up, which is fine with me.

753
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:14,000
Questbuster in chat says, I hope the series does the story justice. That's true. They might embellish some things. They might, you know, make up lies.

754
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:18,000
But that's that's what happens when stories get adapted for TV, I guess.

755
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:22,000
Metal Mayhem says, I've heard of that book thanks to Game Informer, but I never got it.

756
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:28,000
I did get the audiobook version of The Ultimate Guide to Video Games from Pong to Pokemon a while back through Humble Bundle.

757
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:32,000
So I guess audiobook is always a good way to listen to books, too, if you want to do that.

758
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:36,000
Yeah, I got that. I bought that one series. I don't remember which books were in that.

759
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:42,000
But for the record, this is like the one podcast that isn't sponsored by any sort of audiobook service. So I'm not pitching that.

760
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:51,000
No, there was one I got that was it wasn't that it was remember I showed you there was one about ZZT in there about the making of like ZZT.

761
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:57,000
But I don't remember what that one was. And they were a small like I wouldn't even necessarily call it a book.

762
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:03,000
I mean, it was a book, but it was really short. And I don't remember which Humble Bundle it was.

763
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,000
But I bought that one with the ZZT thing because.

764
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
Boss Fight Books says PixelBox.

765
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,000
There you go. Thank you. Yes.

766
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:12,000
Chatter is always there to save the day when we can't remember things.

767
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:20,000
When I'm too lazy to search it in Google or go into Humble Bundle and actually see what what it's called speaking, which I have to see what they have on there right now.

768
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:28,000
I'm compelled to buy things that I don't need. That's where I should spend my hundred dollars on this crap.

769
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
Ooh, programming.

770
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:31,000
Hi.

771
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:36,000
Anyways, moving on. Let's talk about Bloodstained and the Switch version.

772
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:43,000
So the Switch version of Bloodstained finally came out this week because it was delayed a week from the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions.

773
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:46,000
That's the version that I ended up getting through my Kickstarter.

774
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:50,000
But due to the things I talked about earlier, I just haven't gotten around to playing it yet.

775
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:58,000
But apparently the port is not quite performing on the same level as the other versions, which, you know, due to technical.

776
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:01,000
You know, what's inside a switch is not what's inside a PlayStation 4.

777
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,000
So you write a little bit of it at the same time.

778
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:10,000
If you're going to put the game on the switch, it needs to be able to perform at a respectable, comparable level just as far as the game goes.

779
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
And apparently it's having some problems.

780
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:17,000
I have not played it myself, so I don't feel comfortable saying it's doing X or Y or Z for me.

781
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:21,000
How would they even put that on the Wii U when that was originally the plan, was to put it on the Wii U?

782
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:26,000
I mean, I can't imagine that that would have been successful at all if they're having trouble on the Switch.

783
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:31,000
Yeah, I don't know. I think they changed. I'm sorry, I'm having a coughing fit, guys.

784
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:37,000
But anyways. Yeah, that's unfortunate. I do want to play it, though.

785
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:40,000
Yeah. Sorry, guys. Coughing fit's terrible when you're trying to do a show.

786
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:45,000
Anyway, I'm curious what you guys in chat, if any of you have played it on the Switch.

787
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:50,000
And do you guys think a lot of this talk is, like, you know, because sometimes, you know how it goes.

788
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:55,000
Like, gamers will take a few small minor things and make a big fucking deal out of it, you know.

789
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:59,000
I think we saw that happen with Mass Effect Andromeda in some cases, you know, and so on.

790
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:04,000
So I'm curious if you guys think it really is a problem for those of you that have played Bloodstained on Switch.

791
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:10,000
But apparently low resolution and handheld is getting called out. Some visual pieces are not there.

792
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:14,000
I would expect that the graphic fidelity is probably a little bit downgraded.

793
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:18,000
Like, if there's some missing things that aren't in the other ones, I might expect a little bit of that.

794
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:24,000
I mean, but then again, I feel like Bloodstained is not, like, it's still like a 2.5D.

795
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:28,000
Like, you know, it's 3D, but in a 2D game. So I feel like it's not.

796
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:29,000
It should be very minimal.

797
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:30,000
Yeah, right.

798
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:38,000
So anyway, well, it is important to point out the developers behind Bloodstained have addressed all these issues on their Kickstarter page and saying they are going to update it.

799
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:42,000
Saying, quote, we have been listening to feedback regarding the Switch's performance.

800
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:47,000
Our goal is for everyone, regardless of platform, to be able to enjoy the game and have it run smoothly.

801
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:50,000
We will want to live up to your and our expectations.

802
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:54,000
Throughout the QA process, we have been addressing performance issues in the game.

803
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:59,000
Update 101 was published to Switch prior to launch to add content and improve performance.

804
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:04,000
Because they seem to remember, didn't the Switch version have problems at a convention that they were showing you at?

805
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
And they were kind of like, it's further along.

806
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
I seem to remember that was the thing at, like, PAX or something.

807
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
I sort of remember that.

808
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:13,000
Anyway, they said it did not accomplish as much as we'd hoped, and we need to do more.

809
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:20,000
To address the concerns brought up by the community, we are immediately shifting resources to improve performance and stability for the Switch.

810
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:23,000
So don't expect any type of DLC or anything else right away, because they've got to fix this.

811
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:29,000
You can expect a number of small updates that will improve different areas of the game, rather than waiting longer for one big update.

812
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,000
We will have more details as we dive into the work.

813
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:34,000
We thank you for your patience, et cetera, et cetera.

814
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:38,000
So now I'm starting to wonder if, should I bother starting?

815
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:41,000
Or should I wait a month for them to get some patches out?

816
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,000
I don't know.

817
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:46,000
YYR in chat says, are there any versions that don't have issues?

818
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:49,000
Questbuster says, the Bloodstained Switch issues make me sad.

819
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:53,000
I have the PlayStation 4 version, which has its own issues, but the Switch issues sound worse.

820
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:56,000
Darktoseo says, it should be damned. I still want it.

821
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
Let's see.

822
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:03,000
Darktoseo reminds us, they say they are working on it for patches and other fixes.

823
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:11,000
Questbuster says, the only thing I don't like about the PS4 version are some of the loads, especially around saves and reloads.

824
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,000
Otherwise, amazing game.

825
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:17,000
And YYR says, wait, they already patched it? That means it must have been even worse before.

826
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:25,000
That's why I'm kind of remembering, I really feel like if you go back to some of the things we talked about around like PAX East this year, I want to say it was the thing.

827
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:33,000
I want to say that they showed a Bloodstained demo on the floor on the Switch, and that this kind of feedback was coming in, and they kind of said we're already working on a patch.

828
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:38,000
So I feel like this 1.01 was kind of the post PAX update, perhaps?

829
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:43,000
I don't know. I mean, obviously I'm not on the inside. I don't know what exactly it is.

830
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:47,000
But I feel like that might be why the Switch version was already starting to see some patches.

831
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:55,000
But I still want to play the game. I'm hoping people are just kind of blowing it out of proportion.

832
01:00:55,000 --> 01:01:01,000
I can deal with a little frame skip here and there, but if it is super jittery throughout the whole thing, it's going to be annoying.

833
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:07,000
We'll see. Here's hoping. Anyway, let's move on. Another story. Loki.

834
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:16,000
So where you have many franchises adding Battle Royale to their games, now you have a Battle Royale franchise that's adding a single player campaign.

835
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:23,000
But why single player? Nobody plays single player games anymore. Single player is dead, I've been told.

836
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:28,000
But apparently not, because that's what PUBG is going to be doing.

837
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:34,000
They're working on actually creating an original narrative experience set in the same universe.

838
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:48,000
Apparently the game is, the single player campaign they're saying is going to be written by Glenn Shulfield, who actually did the original Dead Space.

839
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:53,000
And I guess has worked on Call of Duty when he was at Sledgehammer Games as well.

840
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:58,000
So, interesting that that's going to be a thing. I don't know.

841
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:09,000
By the sounds of this, it almost sounds like it's going to be a separate game, kind of in the same universe, to the effect of Titanfall and Apex Legends, but kind of in the reverse.

842
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:16,000
So, interesting. I'd be curious to see what this is all about, but...

843
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:19,000
Single player's dead!

844
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:31,000
Yeah, isn't it interesting how that whole thing has come full circle? It was like everything had to have a Battle Royale mode, and now it's like, oh, but if your game, you know, like this is only Battle Royale, and maybe PUBG's kind of been eclipsed.

845
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:37,000
I want to say, I don't want to, because, you know, fans of PUBG are going to be like, there's still a ton of people playing PUBG. Of course there are.

846
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:45,000
But, you know, a lot of the conversation has been around Fortnite and, you know, other Battle Royale games. Heck, we're talking about another Battle Royale game later in the show that's very unexpected.

847
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:49,000
Although, I think they're cheating on that one, but I will get to it later.

848
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:56,000
But anyway, there's a lot of games using the Battle Royale moniker. Tetris 99, which, but that one's really cool, obviously.

849
01:02:56,000 --> 01:03:07,000
You know, there's a lot of games that are using that Battle Royale thing, and now it's kind of like, okay, maybe PUBG's having a hard time kind of standing out, so it kind of like needs the single player thing to bring people back to it and experience this again.

850
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:15,000
Like, I think for some people, it's probably like the people that already had it and bought it for Battle Royale, but moved on to Fortnite, moved on to Apex Legends.

851
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:20,000
It's, oh, I have this new single player mode to check out. I should come on back and check out the game.

852
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:26,000
And maybe if I come on back and check out the game and stream it to Twitch, other people will check out the game for the first time.

853
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:30,000
And so I think they're hoping for kind of like a domino effect with that a little bit.

854
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:39,000
So, Metal Mayhem in chat says, single player is dead. Why wasn't I notified of this? I've pretty much been playing single player stuff exclusively. I guess I was wasting my time.

855
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:47,000
Well, I mean, that's what big AAA companies have told me. It's funny, because they'll sell you on that, oh, well, single player is dead.

856
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:53,000
Here's a brand new single player Star Wars game they were putting out as well. They don't fucking know what the hell they're talking about.

857
01:03:53,000 --> 01:04:01,000
They'll say it one instance, but then at the same time, it's dead. But we're making games for that dead genre anyways, because it's dead.

858
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:10,000
YYR in chat says, there was actually an analyst who mused recently that the market could be wide open for AAA single player experiences right now.

859
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:15,000
That gamers are starting to burn out on games as a service and games that are never supposed to end.

860
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:21,000
Yeah, and I think that's why Final Fantasy VII Remake is coming at a really good time, I think, in some ways.

861
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:26,000
So, you know, I think, yeah, for sure, like, AAA single player experiences, I think, absolutely are desired.

862
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:31,000
Hey, YYR, have you ever thought about Snake 360 Royale?

863
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:34,000
Stop.

864
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:37,000
I had to ask. I had to ask. Don't hate me.

865
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:40,000
But think about it.

866
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:41,000
That's Slither.io at that point.

867
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:44,000
Think about it. Think about a giant, oh, has that already been done?

868
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:45,000
That's Slither.io.

869
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:46,000
God damn it.

870
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:50,000
Sort of. Slither.io is a little bit different, but it's basically the same thing.

871
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:54,000
YYR in chat responded with, sometimes less is more, right?

872
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
YYR simply responded with dot, dot, dot.

873
01:04:58,000 --> 01:04:59,000
Don't indulge him.

874
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:01,000
Don't indulge me.

875
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:07,000
Alright, moving on to talk about other ways to maybe bring people back to something

876
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:12,000
and, you know, remind them of the value of the Switch Online Gaming Library.

877
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:18,000
You know, it's no secret. Folks would like to see some more on the NES Online Library.

878
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:19,000
No shit.

879
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:23,000
We still don't know July's games, do we? We got June's. We haven't gotten to July's yet, right?

880
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:26,000
Oh, I'm sure it'll be so amazing that I'll have to just come right...

881
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:30,000
No, it won't. It'll be fucking stupid NES games that no one gives a shit about.

882
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:31,000
Well...

883
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:33,000
Is there another, like, I don't know...

884
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:36,000
It should be noted that perhaps, you know...

885
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
It should be all the Tengen games.

886
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:44,000
I don't think they could do that, I think because of, you know, lawsuits and things like that.

887
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:45,000
I know, would that be funny?

888
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:54,000
Anyway, so in a Japanese interview, Nintendo has actually kind of commented on this whole state of the Switch Online

889
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:59,000
and, you know, could there be more platforms that come to the Switch Online Library in the future?

890
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:00,000
And they said to this, quote,

891
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:05,000
At this place, we cannot tell new information about future classic hardware, among others,

892
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:08,000
but we are thinking about providing an extension of the online service,

893
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:12,000
which is currently providing Famicom or NES software, because it's a Japanese interview,

894
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:15,000
as well as other methods of providing them.

895
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:19,000
We also recognize that there are opinions wanting to play past titles.

896
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:23,000
So at least Nintendo is kind of, like, acknowledging that they hear it.

897
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:32,000
And this theory has come up before on our show, Bobby's show and other shows out there that talk about video games,

898
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:39,000
is that most people are going to have to re-up their Nintendo Switch Online thing in a year, in, like, October.

899
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:44,000
So that would be a really good time for Nintendo to put out more bang for, you know,

900
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:48,000
here's the value you're getting in continuing to be a Nintendo Switch Online subscriber.

901
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:52,000
So I kind of think that is now the point where we're going to start to see,

902
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:56,000
oh, the 20 Super Nintendo games or whatever they decide to do are going to come out that month.

903
01:06:56,000 --> 01:07:01,000
Maybe some other, because it seems like Tetris 99 has done very well for them.

904
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:04,000
So maybe they'll put out something else.

905
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:07,000
Mario Battle Royale, since they shut the other one down, right?

906
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:11,000
I just, I've already made this argument so many times.

907
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:16,000
I don't even, like, they would have made, I think they would have made so much more money

908
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:19,000
just doing straight up virtual console than this crap.

909
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:26,000
Honestly, I mean, I don't even know why they didn't do it, because they would make just so much money.

910
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:31,000
They could still have the online service and give you a couple free games or an access to a library of games,

911
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:35,000
but then separately just have virtual console where you can purchase, like,

912
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:38,000
Super Nintendo games and other stuff that people wanted to get,

913
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:42,000
and they would make so much more money than they're making on this online service.

914
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:45,000
Like, how much is a year? Is it, like, 20 bucks a year or something like that?

915
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:46,000
Yeah.

916
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:49,000
That's like two fucking games on virtual console.

917
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:56,000
Like, it's stupid. It doesn't make any fucking sense that they're doing it this way.

918
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:59,000
Like, I don't get it.

919
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:03,000
This Switch is obviously powerful enough to run Super Nintendo games.

920
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:08,000
The Wii was. I mean, come on. I don't understand why they would do this.

921
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:11,000
Unless they're really going to amp up the emulator.

922
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:15,000
Like, maybe some type of, like, shared scoreboard amongst your friends or something.

923
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,000
I mean, I know. Don't hold your fucking breath.

924
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:21,000
But it could be something that maybe the emulator's going to get kicked up.

925
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:25,000
Like, it's going to be more surprising what it does. I don't know.

926
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:26,000
I'm trying to give them something.

927
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:30,000
Other emulators out there have already done this shit, like, long time ago.

928
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:33,000
Like, probably a decade ago, this stuff has been in place.

929
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:39,000
And Nintendo's now just, like, thinking about, maybe we'll do this or maybe we'll do this.

930
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:42,000
It's, like, it's so dumb. I don't even understand.

931
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,000
They're literally leaving money on the table.

932
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:48,000
As Joe and Hunter Matt points out, we got skunked at E3 with online news.

933
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,000
I wish we'd get a direct about any updates.

934
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:53,000
You know, I've thought about this and the fact that they tend to,

935
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:58,000
and the E3s do tend to be pretty absent of online updates and things like that.

936
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:01,000
And I think, you know, I think I'm okay with it at this point

937
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:04,000
because you have to really think about what is E3 supposed to be.

938
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:09,000
It is a trade show at its core that is supposed to be kind of promoting

939
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:12,000
what the retail lineup is going to be at the end of the year

940
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
and what you're going to be able to find on store shelves.

941
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:17,000
And this type of thing, you know, even though, yes,

942
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:20,000
the industry is starting to move more and more towards digital and all that,

943
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:24,000
this sort of thing is not really something that is, like,

944
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:28,000
they need to show off to a third party or get other people interested in it.

945
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,000
It's very kind of, like, in-house.

946
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:33,000
And so they only need to get their fans on board with it.

947
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:36,000
How do they reach out to their fans? By doing a direct.

948
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,000
Does that make sense? What I'm saying is that the Switch Online

949
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:41,000
is not something that ends up on a store shelf, essentially.

950
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:45,000
So maybe they don't feel like E3 is the time to be doing that

951
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:48,000
because it is very much something that they just kind of do in-house

952
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,000
and then, blip, put it out there when it's done

953
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:53,000
and there's no middleman, no nothing. Does that make sense?

954
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:57,000
That makes sense. They do this all, I mean, they don't put everything out,

955
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:59,000
like, during E3 anyways.

956
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:01,000
And I don't think they even did that for online last year.

957
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:06,000
It was more towards, I think it was a few weeks away from when they launched in September.

958
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:11,000
So I expect that we'll see something kind of in the middle of August anyways

959
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:14,000
for online, kind of an update or whatever.

960
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:17,000
We'll probably have a couple more directs between then.

961
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:22,000
It's just, it's disappointing, though, that we don't know what's coming out.

962
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:25,000
And it's just, I don't know, like, if they're just like,

963
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:27,000
we're going to launch Super Nintendo games.

964
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:30,000
Like, at this point, I'm not even really that excited about it.

965
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:34,000
Like, I have a Super NES Mini or whatever.

966
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:38,000
Like, the only thing I can think of them holding off on doing, like, more NES games and stuff

967
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:43,000
is that they're planning on releasing a version 2 of those with different games on them

968
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:48,000
and maybe do that. I mean, but I don't know who that's even for at that point.

969
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,000
I mean, I don't know.

970
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:54,000
Well, let's travel back to a simpler time.

971
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:58,000
Let's travel back to a console that's so old

972
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:03,000
that we were seeing ports of games on it and emulation.

973
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:07,000
Like, probably at the time, most people did own only a Super Nintendo and things like that.

974
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:10,000
In our segment, the classic game of the week.

975
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:13,000
Usually, Dark Sakura steps into the gaming vault and pulls out a game that she thinks,

976
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:16,000
hey, you guys should check out this game. You should play this game this week.

977
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,000
But she is not here tonight, of course.

978
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:23,000
She has the night off as she is celebrating Pride in San Francisco with her sisters this weekend.

979
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:26,000
So, usually, I would bring a guest on.

980
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,000
I've really been trying to do that in 2019.

981
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:33,000
But since I cut it so close today with me being out of town and doing other things,

982
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:34,000
I didn't even get to do that.

983
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
So, I'm picking one myself tonight.

984
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,000
So, I'm doing a way, way throwback.

985
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:41,000
And we haven't really spotlighted enough games on this console.

986
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:46,000
So, I picked a game tonight from the Atari 2600.

987
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:50,000
And so, my classic game of the week we're doing tonight is

988
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:57,000
an old game by Activision that's called Oink.

989
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:58,000
So, there it is.

990
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:02,000
Oink is the game that we're going to look at tonight.

991
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:05,000
And the sound kind of gets really annoying.

992
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:08,000
So, I'm going to turn it way down so it doesn't get too crazy here.

993
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:11,000
So, Oink was an Atari 2600 video game.

994
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:14,000
And the designer behind the game was Mike Lorenzen.

995
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:17,000
And then Activision did the release in the year 1983.

996
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:20,000
Oink is the Three Little Pigs, basically.

997
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,000
It's a video game based around the Three Little Pigs.

998
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,000
For those that can see the video on Twitch right now,

999
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:28,000
you'll notice the brick building, quote-unquote brick building, is yellow.

1000
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,000
It's supposed to represent straw.

1001
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,000
The next level is brown.

1002
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:33,000
It represents sticks.

1003
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:36,000
And then the last level is red because it represents bricks.

1004
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:37,000
Get it? It's like the fable.

1005
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:40,000
And this is kind of like a reverse breakout sort of thing.

1006
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:43,000
So, you have the pig, and you're playing the pig at the top,

1007
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:49,000
that is trying to fill in the holes that are being blown up by the wolf.

1008
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:51,000
Now, the wolf, I say reverse breakout.

1009
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,000
It's not like the wolf is bouncing a hole around.

1010
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:56,000
But the wolf is kind of shooting this laser beam

1011
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:59,000
that is supposed to be representative of the wolf's breath.

1012
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:01,000
And he can only fire it every so often.

1013
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:05,000
And he uses that to actually knock out the bricks

1014
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:09,000
probably a slight bit faster than you can actually lay them down.

1015
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:14,000
He can also, with that little stream, his little laser beam, his breath,

1016
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:19,000
he can actually pull the pig down to the bottom of the board.

1017
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:21,000
So, that way the pig has to take a few seconds,

1018
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:24,000
a few valuable seconds to run back up

1019
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:27,000
and actually replace, you know, to get the bricks to keep replacing.

1020
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:32,000
And if the wolf can succeed in pulling the pig down all the way

1021
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,000
through like a complete opening in there,

1022
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,000
because you can see again on the Twitch video,

1023
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,000
the wolf is about to like make a big enough opening

1024
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:41,000
where if he grabs the pig, the pig is going to come completely full,

1025
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:45,000
completely through, then the round is over and it goes on to the next house.

1026
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:47,000
So, that is essentially the game.

1027
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:49,000
I know I make it sound very complicated,

1028
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:52,000
but just imagine like a reverse breakout where you are laying down the bricks.

1029
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:57,000
The wolf has a name in the story, Bigelow B. Wolf, or B.B. Wolf.

1030
01:13:57,000 --> 01:14:03,000
And again, you have three houses and the bricks are three layers deep.

1031
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:06,000
And if you get pulled completely through,

1032
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:07,000
which I think is going to happen on the Twitch stream here in a minute,

1033
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:09,000
because that hole is getting really big,

1034
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:13,000
then that round is over and you are going to start a new round here.

1035
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:17,000
You get four points when you put a brick down on the wall.

1036
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:21,000
And if you, you have to use every, there he goes, see he got pulled through,

1037
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:25,000
so now he is going to run off and now the straw one is going to come in here,

1038
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,000
so now he is down to one life basically.

1039
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:29,000
And I think it goes a little bit faster with each board.

1040
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:31,000
And I think you get more points too.

1041
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:35,000
I think it is four points the first time and then like as each new row comes in,

1042
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:37,000
you get like a multiplier basically.

1043
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:40,000
So the wolf attacks also speed up.

1044
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:43,000
So you can't keep this going forever really.

1045
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:47,000
Now here is the thing that a lot of people don't realize about this game

1046
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:52,000
and what I think makes it actually really notable is because,

1047
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:56,000
and even the Wiki article doesn't talk about this, which I found very surprising.

1048
01:14:56,000 --> 01:15:01,000
You have to actually kind of dig a little deeper or remember this mode like I do.

1049
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:03,000
If you actually can find a copy of the game manual,

1050
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:06,000
the game manual explains how there are actually three game modes.

1051
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:09,000
Because remember the Atari had that switch which recycled the different game modes.

1052
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:13,000
So game mode number one is one player versus the wolf.

1053
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:17,000
Game mode number two is take turns controlling each pig,

1054
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:19,000
two players versus the wolf.

1055
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:24,000
But here is where I think this game really shined was game number three.

1056
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:28,000
One player controls the pig, one player controls the wolf.

1057
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:32,000
And so it was really like an early example that I can think of,

1058
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:36,000
of like a player versus player type of thing in video games

1059
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:40,000
where the players had two completely different types of mechanics.

1060
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:41,000
Does that make sense?

1061
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:42,000
Yeah.

1062
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,000
So yeah, I think that's what made this game kind of notable

1063
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:47,000
and one reason that I wanted to spotlight it tonight

1064
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:52,000
is because it was really like a different type of battle your friends type of game.

1065
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,000
And I do remember playing this game with my friends

1066
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:58,000
and we would battle and see who could get the higher score

1067
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,000
and it was what we did

1068
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:03,000
because that's as far progressed as the video games were at that point.

1069
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:07,000
So you can also use difficulty switches.

1070
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:11,000
In the A position your pigs have to walk down to the wall to drop an object in place.

1071
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:14,000
In the B position they can drop objects from anywhere on the screen.

1072
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:17,000
So the A position is a lot harder.

1073
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:20,000
Anyway, for those that did continue to play in the single player mode,

1074
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:24,000
in the single player mode if you were able to score, I think it was 25,000 points,

1075
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:29,000
you could take the picture of your TV screen and get the old school achievements,

1076
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:32,000
the actual patches that Activision would mail you

1077
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,000
for you to put on, I don't know, your jacket or whatever,

1078
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:38,000
and you get an oinker's patch.

1079
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:43,000
So as far as a lot of the follow up and reception and so forth,

1080
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:49,000
apparently Oink got an award of the most humorous video game computer game in 1984.

1081
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:51,000
I guess it's funny. I don't know.

1082
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:54,000
I mean a video game called Oink is kind of funny.

1083
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,000
They could have called the game The Three Little Pigs

1084
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,000
and it would have made just as much sense,

1085
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,000
but instead they called it Oink.

1086
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,000
You know, squeal like a pig I guess.

1087
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,000
If you would like to check out this game,

1088
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:07,000
you could check out a collection called the Activision Anthology,

1089
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:11,000
but otherwise I don't know if this one shows up on the flashback consoles.

1090
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:14,000
I think I have seen it on some of those Atari flashback consoles,

1091
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:17,000
the one that included Atari 2600 games,

1092
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:20,000
but it's missing from a lot of them.

1093
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:27,000
So anyway, I'm looking in chat over at twitch.tv slash vognetwork.

1094
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:30,000
Darktichia says, whoa, a competitive mode.

1095
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:31,000
Okay, that's neat.

1096
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:34,000
Yeah, it's kind of what made it special a little bit, I think,

1097
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,000
and worthy of highlighting this week.

1098
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:39,000
And PixelPaka says, the oinker's patch is cute.

1099
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:41,000
It sure is.

1100
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:43,000
And definitely would have a whole new meaning for some people.

1101
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:45,000
Just putting it out there.

1102
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:48,000
Metal Mayhem says, I never had this game for the 2600.

1103
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:52,000
I don't think this was as well known, and that's part of the reason.

1104
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:58,000
Activision had a lot of real big games for the Atari 2600.

1105
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:02,000
River Raid, Pitfall certainly was a big one.

1106
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:03,000
They had a lot.

1107
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:06,000
I don't think Oink was ever really one of their big successes,

1108
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:09,000
but I think, again, because of this two-player mode that I was talking about,

1109
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:11,000
it's a pretty big deal that I think is worth spotlighting.

1110
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:12,000
So there you go.

1111
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:13,000
Oh, Kaboom! Thank you, YYR.

1112
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:14,000
Yeah, there's a lot of them.

1113
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:18,000
And YYR says, this game looks great, and I'm sad I never heard about it until now.

1114
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:19,000
Thank you.

1115
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:21,000
I'm happy to help educate.

1116
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:24,000
That's part of what we do here at Orange Lounge Radio

1117
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,000
in the Classic Game of the Week.

1118
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:29,000
Now you guys are all naming all the Atari games I'm forgetting.

1119
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:32,000
H-E-R-O, Keystone Capers, yes, yes.

1120
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,000
I'm going to cross my fingers and toes.

1121
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,000
Maybe some of those will show up on Antstream or something.

1122
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,000
I don't think Antstream has the Atari 2600 stuff yet,

1123
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:41,000
but hopefully that's something they're going to grow to in the future.

1124
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:44,000
Well, that's supposed to be the Atari console that they've got.

1125
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:45,000
Oh, yeah.

1126
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:46,000
Well, after that.

1127
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,000
Well, they still may put it on there.

1128
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,000
Technically, these are Activision's games, too,

1129
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:51,000
so you never know what will happen.

1130
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:52,000
That's true.

1131
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:55,000
And actually, speaking of Antstream real quick,

1132
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:58,000
their official launch is tomorrow in the UK,

1133
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:01,000
so they actually aren't launching in the US right away.

1134
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:03,000
They're going to start in the UK, because that's where they're based.

1135
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:06,000
But I guess us early backers, and disclosure, I'm a backer,

1136
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,000
that got in in the US, we get to keep it,

1137
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:10,000
but they're going to start the new game releases coming up pretty soon.

1138
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:11,000
Oh, cool.

1139
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:14,000
When are they launching officially everything?

1140
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:15,000
For the UK? Tomorrow.

1141
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:16,000
Oh, US, too.

1142
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:17,000
They haven't set it for the US yet.

1143
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:20,000
So they're doing that for non-backers, too, at some point?

1144
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:21,000
Yeah.

1145
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:23,000
Non-backers in the UK can get in tomorrow, basically.

1146
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:24,000
Cool.

1147
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:28,000
So they haven't said if we're talking months, weeks, or what.

1148
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:31,000
I imagine they want to launch, make sure it's smooth, stable,

1149
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:32,000
all that good stuff.

1150
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:35,000
And then I don't think the US will wait that long.

1151
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:37,000
So we'll see, though.

1152
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:40,000
Anyway, all right.

1153
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:41,000
Let's move on.

1154
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:43,000
Sadly, no video segment this week.

1155
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:46,000
I didn't have time to make one with everything else going on,

1156
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,000
although Loki's looking at doing some stuff, right?

1157
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:51,000
Yeah, I was going to do some stuff, but I haven't filmed anything yet.

1158
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:54,000
I will use this opportunity to give you guys a reminder.

1159
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:57,000
We played a little promotional video at the beginning of the stream tonight,

1160
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:59,000
and we will play it again at the end,

1161
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:04,000
just because VOG Network is a sponsor of the Southern Fried Game Room Expo

1162
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:07,000
that's coming up in the Atlanta area this July.

1163
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:12,000
And Bobby Black Wolf is going to be there in person and attending the festival.

1164
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:15,000
And so if you are in the Southeast, if you're in the Atlanta area,

1165
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:18,000
you want to play some old-school video games, maybe they'll have Oink.

1166
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,000
Who knows? I bet you they've got some consoles set up and stuff,

1167
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:23,000
but I know they do a lot of arcade, a lot of pinball.

1168
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:26,000
I did see the Atari flashback in that promo video.

1169
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:27,000
Yeah, and there's a lot.

1170
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:29,000
They had Rasslin in there, too, because...

1171
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:30,000
That's weird.

1172
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,000
Why not? Well, why not? DragonCon has Rasslin.

1173
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:33,000
Oh, okay.

1174
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:35,000
I guess there's a lot of crossover. Why not?

1175
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:36,000
But anyway, that's happening.

1176
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,000
I believe the dates are the 12th through the 14th in the Atlanta area.

1177
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:41,000
We just want to shout them out, because VOG Network is a sponsor of that.

1178
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:44,000
And shit, we just love old-school video games.

1179
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:47,000
So a convention set up to love old-school video games

1180
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:50,000
and maybe a few new-school ones, too, and throw in some Rasslin as well.

1181
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,000
Hey, we're on board.

1182
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:55,000
So check that out and go say hi to Bobby Black Wolf.

1183
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:58,000
If you can't make that, I really hope you will try to make DragonCon,

1184
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:01,000
which I will be at and Bobby will be at.

1185
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:04,000
And if you're a longtime fan of VOG and you remember shows like

1186
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,000
Guys on a Show or Hoard House,

1187
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:09,000
Xtaphir will be at DragonCon this year for the very first time.

1188
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:15,000
Travis Donovan is back at, I hope, well wishes Travis Donovan out there,

1189
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:17,000
by the way, if you're out there.

1190
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:19,000
I don't know how much of his business I can put out there,

1191
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:24,000
but he had a routine surgery that is completely normal

1192
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:25,000
and just well wishes.

1193
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:26,000
I hope he's doing well.

1194
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,000
As far as I know, we'll still make DragonCon,

1195
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,000
because he's got plenty of time to recover and all that good stuff.

1196
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:35,000
So yeah, so lots of VOG personalities.

1197
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:38,000
I don't remember if Brian from British Invaders is going this year

1198
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,000
or John from Critical Myth.

1199
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:41,000
I haven't checked on the status of those.

1200
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:43,000
I'm sure Gary from Critical Myth will be there.

1201
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:45,000
I know some of these shows have sunsetted,

1202
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:48,000
but it's still good to see them and hang out once a year.

1203
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,000
So DragonCon is coming up as well, Labor Day weekend.

1204
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:51,000
Very excited.

1205
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:54,000
I don't know how much I'm allowed to say yet,

1206
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:59,000
but I will say that I have seen an early draft of what Bobby and I

1207
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:01,000
are going to be involved with.

1208
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:04,000
And like last year, we did several panels and stuff,

1209
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:07,000
so you can probably guess there's going to be a similar thing

1210
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:08,000
going on this year.

1211
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:12,000
And I'm really excited about some of the stuff I'm seeing.

1212
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:15,000
There are some panels this year, especially one for me,

1213
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:18,000
where I'm like, I'm hyped about this.

1214
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:19,000
This is going to be great.

1215
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:22,000
So I'll tease you with that and more details to come in future weeks.

1216
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,000
Okay, now we'll get back into some gaming news

1217
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:27,000
and tackle some rapid-fire news.

1218
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:31,000
All right, so let's talk about some stuff we're going to get for free.

1219
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:35,000
Well, not necessarily free, because you're paying for those online services.

1220
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:37,000
But Games of Gold and PlayStation Plus.

1221
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:40,000
So Games of Gold in July.

1222
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:44,000
We are getting Inside from July 1st to the 31st,

1223
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:49,000
and Big Crown Showdown from July 16th through the 15th.

1224
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:52,000
And then on the Xbox 360 backwards compatible games,

1225
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:56,000
Castlevania Symphony of the Night from July 1st through the 15th,

1226
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,000
and then the really old movie tie-in,

1227
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:03,000
Meet the Robinsons from July 16th through the 31st.

1228
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,000
It was an okay movie. I liked it.

1229
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:11,000
You know, I talked to someone recently that had not played Castlevania Symphony of the Night,

1230
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:14,000
and I was trying to explain, like, Bloodstained,

1231
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:18,000
because it was a game that I had planned to play that evening and never got around to.

1232
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,000
And I was like, oh, it's kind of like Castlevania Symphony of the Night,

1233
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,000
and this person I was talking to didn't really know about it.

1234
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:25,000
And I was like, oh, man, you got to check it out if you ever have time.

1235
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:28,000
And then it was so funny that this came up today.

1236
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:32,000
I saw this, and I was like, oh, shit, this would be nice if this person has an Xbox.

1237
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:35,000
They're going to be able to get it for free coming up here soon, so it's pretty cool.

1238
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:39,000
PlayStation Plus, we're going to be getting two games, of course.

1239
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:46,000
So Pro Evolution Soccer 2019 and Horizon Chase Zero

1240
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:50,000
are going to be the two games that we get for PlayStation.

1241
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,000
I know not everybody's into Pro Evo Soccer,

1242
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:55,000
but it's nice to kind of see a sports game that's happening.

1243
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:59,000
Okay, so Mr. Smoosh is exploring the kitchen counter.

1244
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:03,000
I need to go discourage him from doing so because he's getting a little, yeah.

1245
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:06,000
So, Loki, if you wouldn't mind just buying me some time.

1246
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:07,000
Sure, of course.

1247
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:09,000
Ah, cats.

1248
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:13,000
Anyways, and then let's talk a little bit about Crackdown 3,

1249
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:16,000
a game I haven't been back to since I originally beat it.

1250
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,000
But now I have a reason to go back

1251
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:22,000
because there's going to be a brand new update coming to it pretty soon.

1252
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:25,000
It's called the Flying High update,

1253
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:29,000
and it adds a wingsuit into the game,

1254
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:36,000
as well as apparently some other updates or other achievements.

1255
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:40,000
So 16 achievements, totaling 500 gamer score.

1256
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:42,000
And I don't know what else.

1257
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:45,000
Oh, the Agency Peacekeeper Beacon,

1258
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:49,000
which you can use for callings in civilian backup.

1259
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:51,000
And they said an elemental forge,

1260
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:55,000
and a hellstorm flare for air strikes,

1261
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:58,000
and some cluster duck grenade.

1262
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,000
Cluster duck?

1263
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:04,000
Well, yeah, they had kind of a silly thing with the original Crackdown game.

1264
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,000
I think it was a pre-order bonus or something like that

1265
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:09,000
where you get an exploding rubber duck,

1266
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:12,000
and you can use that as a grenade.

1267
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:15,000
But, I don't know.

1268
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:17,000
I'll check it out.

1269
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:20,000
Meh.

1270
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,000
And that's what they wrote.

1271
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:23,000
Meh.

1272
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:24,000
I still need to play Crackdown 3.

1273
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:27,000
I have the Xbox Pass now, so I just...

1274
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:28,000
Yeah, you should try it.

1275
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,000
Add that to the fucking list of games I need to catch up on.

1276
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,000
It's all right, but I got a LARP.

1277
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:36,000
It's only a few hours to beat the game.

1278
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,000
And it's good, and you're just like, eh, cool.

1279
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:41,000
Well, ironically, we were talking about Battle Royale games earlier,

1280
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:43,000
and there's another one coming out, Tetris Royale.

1281
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:47,000
Wait a minute. Don't we already have Tetris Battle Royale?

1282
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:49,000
Of course we do. Tetris 99, of course.

1283
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:51,000
But there's a new one coming out.

1284
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:53,000
Maybe because of the success of Tetris 99.

1285
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:55,000
I don't know. Tetris Royale.

1286
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:57,000
Tetris Royale is a cell phone game.

1287
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:59,000
It's an iOS Android game. It's not a Switch game.

1288
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:01,000
So that's, ah, there's the difference there.

1289
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:03,000
Tetris Royale is what they call it in the UK

1290
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:05,000
because they're on the metric system.

1291
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:07,000
They don't have a quarter pound. Yes, yes.

1292
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:10,000
Anyway, no footage right now

1293
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,000
because I guess it's early on or whatever.

1294
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,000
But of course Tetris Royale, they are saying

1295
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,000
we'll have a variety of game modes from

1296
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,000
100 players, not 99, but 100 players

1297
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,000
battling Tetris with each other

1298
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,000
to daily competitions

1299
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:24,000
and so on and so on.

1300
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,000
I think the, ah,

1301
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:28,000
who is developing this one?

1302
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:30,000
It's not the same developers.

1303
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,000
Because the developers of Tetris 99

1304
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:34,000
are also the people behind the Grandmaster.

1305
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:36,000
And they are not doing this one.

1306
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:38,000
So somebody else kind of licensed Tetris.

1307
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,000
Let's hope it's not Ubisoft.

1308
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:42,000
No, it's not. It's not Ubisoft. It's somebody else.

1309
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,000
Ah, and, um,

1310
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:46,000
oh, okay, no, it is Network.

1311
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,000
N3 TWORK.

1312
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,000
That's doing it because they

1313
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:52,000
got the multi-year contract to

1314
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:54,000
exclusively develop and publish

1315
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:56,000
new Tetris games built from the ground up

1316
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:58,000
for mobile devices worldwide

1317
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,000
excluding China.

1318
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,000
So. I would have been really

1319
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:04,000
interested in this if this was Hatris

1320
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:06,000
Battle Royale, but, you know. Or FaceTris?

1321
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:08,000
FaceTris. Or WordTris?

1322
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:10,000
Uh,

1323
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,000
Nifty 805 is asking, don't you all have

1324
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:14,000
phones?

1325
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:16,000
It's the hot new way to play, ah, Tetris.

1326
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,000
So. Ah, DarkTitsu, you're reminding

1327
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:20,000
us the name of the developer of Tetris 99

1328
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:22,000
who I failed to mention. Ah, Arica.

1329
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,000
Is, ah, the developer that did

1330
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:26,000
Tetris 99, so. And ActDeft

1331
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:28,000
in chat saying, we need a new Tetris Grandmaster

1332
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:30,000
dammit. Ah, I think there'd be a lot of people

1333
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:32,000
happy to see that if that actually happened over here.

1334
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:34,000
You know, the good news is Switch is region free, so they

1335
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:36,000
did it on the Switch and they even put it out only in Japan

1336
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:38,000
and you can still kind of get it here. And it's Tetris,

1337
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,000
so you wouldn't have to have a deep understanding of Japanese.

1338
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,000
We'll see. I don't know.

1339
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:44,000
Anyway. Ah, moving

1340
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:46,000
on to talking about, oh, this is interesting.

1341
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:48,000
This is a follow up to the little

1342
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:50,000
Commodore 64 mini that you got me last week.

1343
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:52,000
Which, thanks again. No problem.

1344
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:54,000
Um, and, ah, you mentioned it was on a deep

1345
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:56,000
discount, which is part of the reason why you got it.

1346
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:58,000
You're like, oh, I'll get it now. And I said, I think

1347
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,000
it's because they're making a new one. Well, guess what, Logie?

1348
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,000
They're making a new one. So,

1349
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:04,000
the deal is, is that they're putting out a

1350
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:06,000
new version with a full size

1351
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:08,000
keyboard and they're simply calling it

1352
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:10,000
the C64 micro

1353
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:12,000
computer. It's going to have the

1354
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:14,000
same 64 games in it, but

1355
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:16,000
this time the keyboard is fully sized

1356
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:18,000
and fully functional. So you don't have to use

1357
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,000
like a separate USB keyboard to get

1358
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,000
in there and actually do the typing. You use that keyboard.

1359
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:24,000
What's also interesting about it, in my

1360
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,000
opinion, is that it is going to emulate not

1361
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,000
just Commodore 64, but

1362
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:30,000
VIC-20. So, which

1363
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:32,000
was kind of the predecessor

1364
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,000
to Commodore 64. No word

1365
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:36,000
on Commodore 128

1366
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:38,000
or the, what was the other one,

1367
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:40,000
the 16 plus

1368
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:42,000
4C or whatever the other one was.

1369
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:44,000
There was another Commodore

1370
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:46,000
that came out. I don't think it did well here at all.

1371
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:48,000
When did we get our Amiga?

1372
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:50,000
Hell yeah!

1373
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,000
Why not an Amiga thing? I don't know, we'll see.

1374
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:54,000
Well, that's the platform,

1375
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:56,000
that's the thing, and stream

1376
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:58,000
has a lot of Amiga stuff in it right now.

1377
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,000
So, you can't

1378
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,000
get your Amiga life through that.

1379
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:04,000
I mean, a lot of the stuff that was big in the UK.

1380
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,000
Amiga, Spectrum, they have some Commodore 64

1381
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:08,000
in there as well. You know,

1382
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:10,000
the Amstream retro stuff is covering a lot of that.

1383
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:12,000
So, anyway, otherwise it's going to be pretty

1384
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,000
much similar to the

1385
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:16,000
Commodore 64 mini that's already out,

1386
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:18,000
but the larger keyboard is definitely going to be a game

1387
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:20,000
changer. The resolution output is

1388
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:22,000
maxed at 720p, so sorry

1389
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:24,000
you will not be able to play games in 4K

1390
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:26,000
all of a sudden. December 5th, 2019

1391
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:28,000
is supposedly the day that this new one

1392
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:30,000
is going to ship. So that is still

1393
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:32,000
a little ways out, but just about close enough.

1394
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:34,000
Considering the resolution of what it is

1395
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:36,000
anyways, 720p

1396
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,000
upscale to 4K is going to

1397
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:40,000
look the same, I would imagine.

1398
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:42,000
And it's Commodore 64, it's just like

1399
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:44,000
the edges get edgier,

1400
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:46,000
that's about it, right?

1401
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:48,000
Alright, anyhow.

1402
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:50,000
Moving on

1403
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,000
and talking about

1404
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:54,000
what's going to come out in stores near

1405
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:56,000
you very soon as we travel around the world

1406
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:58,000
and look at world release dates.

1407
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:00,000
So, the US, Loki.

1408
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,000
So, of course, as you're aware, Final Fantasy XIV Shadowbringers

1409
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:04,000
is going to be coming out this week on PC and

1410
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:06,000
PlayStation 4. Officially.

1411
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:08,000
Alternate Jake Hunter

1412
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:10,000
Daedalus, The Awakening of the Golden Jazz.

1413
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:14,000
I have no idea what the fuck that is,

1414
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:16,000
but that's an amazing title.

1415
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:18,000
Coming out on PC.

1416
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:20,000
Stranger Things 3, the game.

1417
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:22,000
That's coming out on PC, PlayStation 4,

1418
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:24,000
Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch.

1419
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:26,000
Also the show coming out on the 4th as well.

1420
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:28,000
Clonad on

1421
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:30,000
Nintendo Switch. The Ninja Warriors

1422
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:32,000
once again on Nintendo

1423
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:34,000
Switch and PlayStation 4.

1424
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:36,000
Attack on Titan 2, Final

1425
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:38,000
Battle on PlayStation 4,

1426
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:40,000
Xbox One, Switch, and PC.

1427
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:42,000
Sea of Solitude on

1428
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:44,000
PC,

1429
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:46,000
PlayStation 4, and

1430
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:48,000
Xbox One. And

1431
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:50,000
that's it.

1432
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:52,000
Alright, traveling over to Japan real quick.

1433
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:54,000
A pretty similar lineup

1434
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:56,000
with Final Fantasy XIV, of course,

1435
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:58,000
making its way in Japan officially

1436
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:00,000
this week on the 2nd. The same day

1437
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,000
it's out everywhere else officially.

1438
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:04,000
But there's just a

1439
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:06,000
few releases here on July 4th in

1440
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:08,000
Japan. Remember, it's a holiday

1441
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:10,000
in the US, but not Japan. So they get game releases

1442
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:12,000
on July 4th. So the

1443
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:14,000
games coming out on PS4 are

1444
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:16,000
Pixark and

1445
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:18,000
Shingeki no Kaioshin 2

1446
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:20,000
Final Battle from Koei

1447
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:22,000
Tecmo is the big release.

1448
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:24,000
Attack on Titan 2. That's it.

1449
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:26,000
Those are the big releases on the PlayStation 4.

1450
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:28,000
And then the Switch, those

1451
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:30,000
exact same games, but that

1452
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:32,000
Clonad game is the other big release in

1453
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:34,000
Japan this week. So kind of a lot of overlap

1454
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:36,000
this week. How about the UK?

1455
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:38,000
UK, we've got

1456
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:40,000
looks like Red Faction

1457
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:42,000
Guerrilla Remarse edition

1458
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:44,000
that's going to be coming out.

1459
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:46,000
We've got, oh that's

1460
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:48,000
on Nintendo Switch. Final Fantasy

1461
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:50,000
XIV Shadowbringers on

1462
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:52,000
PC and PlayStation 4.

1463
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:54,000
Attack on Titan 2. The Final Battle

1464
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:56,000
on PC, PlayStation, I'm sorry

1465
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:58,000
PlayStation 4, Xbox One and

1466
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:00,000
Switch. Tour de France on

1467
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,000
Xbox One.

1468
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:04,000
We have Sirento

1469
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:06,000
VR on PlayStation 4.

1470
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:08,000
And that's it.

1471
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:10,000
Alright. Let's move on

1472
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:12,000
to the mailbag. Every week we invite you

1473
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:14,000
to email us. Participate at

1474
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:16,000
orangelandre.com and we read

1475
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:18,000
your emails here live on the show.

1476
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:20,000
I think we just have one quick one

1477
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:22,000
tonight coming in this week from

1478
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:24,000
Redertainment. So yeah,

1479
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:26,000
Redertainment sent us an email this week to participate

1480
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:28,000
at orangelandre.com and I

1481
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:30,000
encourage you to email us. Fill up that mailbag

1482
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:32,000
who says, hello peoples.

1483
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:34,000
I'm at Salt Lake Gaming Con

1484
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:36,000
and there's a pinball table that is really

1485
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:38,000
outstanding to me. It's Genie

1486
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:40,000
by Gottlieb. It's a

1487
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:42,000
four player competitive old style

1488
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:44,000
multi flipper table.

1489
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:46,000
It's the kind of thing that I would buy if I had the space

1490
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:48,000
and money. And that is signed from

1491
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:50,000
Redertainment saying this message was

1492
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:52,000
brought to you by cool shit you only

1493
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:54,000
see at cons. He actually sent a little

1494
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:56,000
picture. It's a little bit low resolution for me

1495
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:58,000
to actually show on the stream

1496
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:00,000
and it ended up coming through tilted sideways.

1497
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,000
But it is one of those old school like

1498
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:04,000
70's-ish kind of machines.

1499
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:06,000
I believe I've played this table

1500
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:08,000
and I think I played it recently when I was at the pinball

1501
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:10,000
Hall of Fame in Vegas

1502
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:12,000
which I talked about several weeks ago.

1503
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:14,000
God, it was probably closer to the end

1504
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:16,000
of last year. No, where the hell was I

1505
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:18,000
in Vegas? I can't remember anymore.

1506
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:20,000
But yeah, it was closer to the end of last year I think.

1507
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:22,000
I played it recently when I was there.

1508
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:24,000
And yeah, I'll pass that along

1509
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:26,000
to Jamie because she'll get a kick out of that.

1510
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:28,000
But yeah, old school pinball tables.

1511
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:30,000
It's always kind of fun to go back and discover stuff

1512
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:32,000
especially in that 70. You know, because

1513
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:34,000
a lot of like, if you play this stuff from like the 60's

1514
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:36,000
and you know, they're really

1515
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:38,000
old and they're cool.

1516
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:40,000
They still have a lot of like replay value

1517
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:42,000
and stuff. There's just not as much

1518
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:44,000
going on necessarily.

1519
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:46,000
But you know, you really start to see

1520
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:48,000
that phase when things started going from the

1521
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:50,000
little spinning numbers to the digital numbers

1522
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:52,000
and the boards started getting more digital

1523
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:54,000
themselves and more lights and things like that.

1524
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:56,000
Like there's just a lot of like neat stuff that

1525
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:58,000
came out such as you know, multi flippers

1526
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:00,000
and things like that. So yeah, very

1527
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,000
cool. So I'm glad. It sounds like this

1528
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:04,000
Salt Lake Con that

1529
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:06,000
Retertainment was at is probably very similar to like

1530
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:08,000
Southern Fry Game Room Expo and there's probably many

1531
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:10,000
cons like it in cities throughout America

1532
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:12,000
where you can go experience some of these

1533
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:14,000
things. So, pretty cool.

1534
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:16,000
But that wasn't really our only email

1535
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:18,000
this week. So participate at

1536
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:20,000
orangelaundry.com if you would like to send us

1537
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:22,000
an email for a future week. Hey, we don't mind

1538
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:24,000
the shout outs of things that you guys see

1539
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:26,000
at Gaming Cons. We really love

1540
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:28,000
video though, because then we can put that

1541
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:30,000
in the middle of our show. So think about that.

1542
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:32,000
Anyway, don't you all have cell phones?

1543
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:34,000
Don't they all shoot video?

1544
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:36,000
Alright.

1545
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:38,000
All that aside, let's move on and

1546
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:40,000
talk about some more headlines,

1547
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:42,000
some things we've kind of referenced so

1548
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:44,000
far. Right, Logie? Yes. So speaking

1549
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:46,000
of cell phones, if you have a cell phone

1550
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:48,000
you can check out Flappy

1551
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:50,000
Royale. It is a

1552
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:52,000
battle royale flappy

1553
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:54,000
bird type game. I use

1554
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:56,000
air quotes because it's not necessarily

1555
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:58,000
that you're battling each other. This is battle royale

1556
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:00,000
as in the same as the Mario

1557
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:02,000
battle royale was battle royale

1558
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:04,000
where you're playing at the same time

1559
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:06,000
trying to accomplish something

1560
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:08,000
but

1561
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:10,000
it's a flappy bird so you're probably going to die pretty

1562
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:12,000
fast. Yes. And

1563
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:14,000
for one, it's not easy

1564
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:16,000
to get on iOS. You have to

1565
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:18,000
do the whole test flight thing

1566
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:20,000
which I've only ever used when I

1567
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:22,000
was in the Pokemon Go beta so long

1568
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:24,000
ago for being a high level Ingress player. I installed

1569
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:26,000
test flight and I've since uninstalled it because I didn't

1570
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:28,000
need it for anything else. But you can

1571
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:30,000
play it in a browser window. That's

1572
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,000
how I played it. So I did play this

1573
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:34,000
earlier just to check it out.

1574
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:36,000
And one thing that I noticed when I played it

1575
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:38,000
is that there's no

1576
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:40,000
way that you're actually

1577
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:42,000
matching live with other people. There's

1578
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:44,000
no way that's happening because

1579
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:46,000
if you fuck up, you go right

1580
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:48,000
back into it. So I think

1581
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:50,000
what it is, it's probably downloading

1582
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:52,000
99 other shadows.

1583
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:54,000
I'm not saying it's like a fake battle royale.

1584
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:56,000
It might be, but I would

1585
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:58,000
see maybe that, and like you said, this Mario

1586
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:00,000
thing that Nintendo pulled I think was like this

1587
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,000
is that you're basically running against

1588
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:04,000
99 shadows of

1589
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:06,000
other people running. And I think

1590
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:08,000
that's probably what's really happening, but it's

1591
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:10,000
not happening live like it

1592
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:12,000
would be in a game like Fortnite or

1593
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:14,000
even Tetris 99.

1594
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:16,000
But I thought it was a hilarious concept.

1595
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:18,000
I mean, just the whole image, and

1596
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:20,000
if you kind of Google this game, the

1597
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:22,000
Flappy Royal,

1598
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:24,000
you can actually see

1599
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:26,000
it's so funny. I love the bus.

1600
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:28,000
I love the bus idea. They show up at the bus.

1601
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:30,000
But then you just see this swarm of birds, it looks

1602
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:32,000
like fucking bees flying everywhere

1603
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:34,000
coming out of the bus. You can't even see like

1604
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:36,000
who you would be. I guess yours is...

1605
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:38,000
Yours is a lot, like you can

1606
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:40,000
actually design your character. So you can actually

1607
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:42,000
my bird looks like Opa Opa from

1608
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:44,000
Fantasy Zone. And then you can actually, like he

1609
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:46,000
wears a little hat. So you can actually like customize

1610
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:48,000
a little bit. And the one you're controlling

1611
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:50,000
does stand out a little

1612
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:52,000
more. Like the colors are all filled in a bit

1613
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:54,000
more. So

1614
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:56,000
it's, it's cute.

1615
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:58,000
But I don't think

1616
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:00,000
it's quite

1617
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:02,000
live battle royale. But I think

1618
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:04,000
this, I mean this is probably done by

1619
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:06,000
did you say it was one or two developers?

1620
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:08,000
Like it's probably just like a couple of people

1621
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:10,000
who did this. Yeah, I didn't say who it was. It was

1622
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:12,000
basically

1623
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:14,000
they have like three

1624
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:16,000
developers. Designers Orta,

1625
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:18,000
Fearox, M. Laser

1626
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:20,000
Walker, and Zach Gage.

1627
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:22,000
So four people.

1628
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:24,000
Akuma JV says what? Rob's bird looks like what?

1629
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:26,000
The lead ship from Fantasy Zone.

1630
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:28,000
There's like a clone of that

1631
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:30,000
in the game. So.

1632
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:32,000
Alright.

1633
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:34,000
Yeah, it's one of those things you

1634
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:36,000
play. Oh that's cute. And then you

1635
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:38,000
probably won't really play again. But you

1636
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:40,000
never know. I mean we'll see.

1637
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:42,000
Maybe this is a great start.

1638
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:44,000
And especially if it's only on Test Flight and things like

1639
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:46,000
that. Maybe the developers

1640
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:48,000
will think about, oh a way you can battle

1641
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:50,000
against your friend's shadows. Or

1642
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:52,000
you know certain courses that are already

1643
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:54,000
laid out. Like there might be ways

1644
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:56,000
to take this concept and make

1645
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:58,000
it much more than something you play once

1646
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:00,000
and go oh cute and then never play again.

1647
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:02,000
Which I think the original Flappy Bird was

1648
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:04,000
for a lot of people. But a lot of people

1649
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:06,000
played that Flappy Bird.

1650
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:08,000
That's one of those amazing

1651
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:10,000
kind of mysteries in video games to this day.

1652
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:12,000
Why did that guy

1653
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:14,000
just pull Flappy Bird when he could have kept making

1654
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:16,000
so much money off of it. And he

1655
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:18,000
ended up releasing more games.

1656
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:20,000
After that he just

1657
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:22,000
and I don't know if he licensed some of that stuff

1658
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:24,000
out because they have arcade games now and

1659
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:26,000
all sorts of crap. And the kids want to drop

1660
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:28,000
a dollar into the play Flappy Bird. I'm like are you

1661
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:30,000
fucking nuts. But maybe you know I

1662
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:32,000
can I can also understand that maybe he's just the fame

1663
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:34,000
and the attention and the

1664
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:36,000
strange phone calls and the people wanting to do

1665
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:38,000
business with you. Like maybe he was just overwhelmed.

1666
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:40,000
Yeah play Crossy Road. I got paid a dollar each

1667
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:42,000
game to play Crossy Road. I'm like you can

1668
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:44,000
play that for free. Why would you pay money.

1669
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:46,000
Pay a dollar to play DDR.

1670
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:48,000
As YYR says in chat.

1671
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:50,000
Daddy I can win tickets.

1672
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:52,000
Barely any.

1673
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:54,000
And I try to tell them I'm like

1674
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:56,000
kid you're not winning enough.

1675
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:58,000
Make it worth my while. They're like well I want to

1676
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:00,000
play this game. Like OK well you just died

1677
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:02,000
and it cost a dollar and you won three tickets.

1678
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:04,000
Or you could play this game right here

1679
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:06,000
and win like 40 tickets

1680
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:08,000
every time. 3 or 40.

1681
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:10,000
And then eventually they understand.

1682
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,000
And they would pay for that $15

1683
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:16,000
ring pop that they want.

1684
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:18,000
In chat says didn't he say that he feared

1685
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:20,000
he would get in trouble because of the popularity of

1686
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:22,000
the game because the country he lives in.

1687
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:24,000
Yeah I think that was part of it. So I'm not trying to

1688
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:26,000
dismiss his

1689
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:28,000
you know cautions about why he stopped making

1690
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:30,000
the game. But it is one of those things that really just kind of

1691
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:32,000
like you know you do take a step back and go wow

1692
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:34,000
like somebody walking away from something

1693
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:36,000
that could have been even bigger and made

1694
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:38,000
even more money. It's like you just don't

1695
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:40,000
hear about that in our industry. It's like the one

1696
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:42,000
time that ever happened for whatever the reason is.

1697
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:44,000
So anyway

1698
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:46,000
let's move on and

1699
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:48,000
talk about a few more stories.

1700
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:50,000
So I believe I'm next with a

1701
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:52,000
follow up on the Pokemon

1702
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:54,000
Dex controversy.

1703
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:56,000
So we got into that on a

1704
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:58,000
previous episode where you know the got to catch

1705
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:00,000
some of them. Not all the Pokemon

1706
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:02,000
are going to be coming over to Sword and Shield

1707
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:04,000
and some of the

1708
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:06,000
protests if you will the virtual

1709
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:08,000
Twitter things and things like that have

1710
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:10,000
not really died down and

1711
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:12,000
this week Game Freak

1712
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:14,000
responded

1713
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:16,000
with a producer letter and

1714
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:18,000
the producer letter

1715
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:20,000
you kind of it was kind of a way

1716
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:22,000
of saying I don't know it was a way of saying like

1717
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:24,000
we're hearing what you're saying but

1718
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:26,000
they didn't they didn't say they were not doing anything

1719
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:28,000
about it. Yeah I don't know if I would say they doubled

1720
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:30,000
down either. What they basically

1721
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:32,000
said was that and let

1722
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:34,000
me read some of the kind of well actually

1723
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:36,000
let me go to the full letter here maybe I can

1724
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:38,000
read some of the longer

1725
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:40,000
passages from it. But

1726
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:42,000
so yeah

1727
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:44,000
I'll just read the whole thing it's not that long.

1728
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:46,000
So the letter stated June 28th and it says

1729
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:48,000
thank you to all our fans for caring so deeply about

1730
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:50,000
Pokemon. Recently I shared the news

1731
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:52,000
that some Pokemon cannot be transferred to Pokemon

1732
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:54,000
Sword and Pokemon Shield. I've read

1733
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:56,000
all your comments and appreciate your love and

1734
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:58,000
passion for Pokemon. Just like

1735
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:00,000
all of you we are passionate

1736
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:02,000
about Pokemon and each and every one of them is very

1737
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:04,000
important to us. After so many years

1738
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:06,000
of developing the Pokemon video games

1739
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:08,000
this is a very difficult decision for me.

1740
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:10,000
I'd like to make one thing clear. Even

1741
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:12,000
if a specific Pokemon is not available

1742
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:14,000
in Pokemon Sword and Shield this does not

1743
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:16,000
mean that it will not appear in future

1744
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:18,000
games. The world of Pokemon continues

1745
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:20,000
to evolve. The Galar region

1746
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:22,000
offers new Pokemon to encounter trainers to battle

1747
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:24,000
and adventures to embark on. We are pouring

1748
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:26,000
our hearts into these games and we hope you will look forward

1749
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:28,000
to joining us in this new journey. So essentially

1750
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:30,000
he's saying if you

1751
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:32,000
are pissed that your Pokemon

1752
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:34,000
is not in this game that doesn't mean we're deleting

1753
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:36,000
them forever or that they're going to

1754
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:38,000
not come back in another Pokemon game

1755
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:40,000
because we all know this franchise is not

1756
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:42,000
going to go away anytime soon.

1757
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:44,000
But I don't know. I think there's a lot of people

1758
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:46,000
that are still just

1759
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:48,000
irritated. I don't know how else

1760
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:50,000
to put it. Let me go to chat.

1761
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:52,000
See what some folks are saying there. I know we've got some Pokefans

1762
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:54,000
in chat that probably have their own thing to say there.

1763
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:56,000
S2100Matt says

1764
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:58,000
we hear you but relax.

1765
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:00,000
It's not like we're going to stop making Pokemon games

1766
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:02,000
where you can still use those.

1767
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:04,000
Act Def says I said it before and I'll say

1768
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:06,000
it again. Yeah it sucks that not all

1769
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:08,000
the Pokemon won't appear in the newest games.

1770
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:10,000
But holy fuck are people over

1771
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:12,000
reacting to this.

1772
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:14,000
Well you know internet gonna internet.

1773
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:16,000
And I think there are some

1774
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:18,000
people overreacting. In fact I would even say there's a lot

1775
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:20,000
of people overreacting. But

1776
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:22,000
you know especially when you hear stories about the whole

1777
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:24,000
like they built up their collection from

1778
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:26,000
childhood. They had

1779
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:28,000
trades from friends they haven't seen.

1780
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:30,000
And like how important the

1781
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:32,000
collection is to some people.

1782
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:34,000
I get why people are left with a

1783
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:36,000
profound sense of

1784
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:38,000
sadness and disappointment.

1785
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:40,000
That part I get.

1786
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:42,000
The Twitter campaigns and that stuff

1787
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:44,000
and change.org and stuff

1788
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:46,000
I just you know but

1789
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:48,000
at the same time if people weren't doing

1790
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:50,000
that would it have prompted this letter.

1791
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:52,000
Is now the Pokemon

1792
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:54,000
company maybe thinking about this for the next

1793
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:56,000
thing they do. So while

1794
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:58,000
I don't I mean they're not going to fix it for Sword and

1795
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:00,000
Shield. We all knew they could. How could they

1796
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:02,000
possibly. The game's got to be wrapping up

1797
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:04,000
development. It's got to go gold by

1798
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:06,000
probably the end of summer early early early

1799
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:08,000
fall so it can get out in time.

1800
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:10,000
But you know maybe again if they decide

1801
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:12,000
to do a Pokemon gun

1802
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:14,000
I keep joking about that. What would it be. Maybe

1803
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:16,000
Pokemon arrow. I don't know.

1804
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:18,000
If a third thing in

1805
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:20,000
Pokemon Knight with a K. I don't know.

1806
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:22,000
So if they end up doing a third

1807
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:24,000
Pokemon in the series perhaps

1808
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:26,000
that will be the one that has all the Pokemon in it.

1809
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:28,000
But now I kind of feel

1810
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:30,000
like through this letter at least maybe like

1811
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:32,000
they're saying OK we

1812
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:34,000
heard you. They're not going to come out and say

1813
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:36,000
we made a mistake. Please. They're

1814
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:38,000
going to say I think they're going to say

1815
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:40,000
the next time we do this

1816
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:42,000
we're going to not

1817
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:44,000
do the same thing. At least

1818
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:46,000
I kind of hope as

1819
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:48,000
a Pokemon fan myself. That's what I'm hearing.

1820
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:50,000
So while they are also

1821
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:52,000
brings up it's hard enough to balance a game with matchups

1822
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:54,000
for over 500 characters. They probably got

1823
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:56,000
tired of having to balance so many

1824
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:58,000
character matchups. So

1825
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:00,000
and then a lot of just

1826
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:02,000
comments in our chat.

1827
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:04,000
DJ Rama S says Pokemon Belt

1828
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:06,000
Sia Tabiri. Pokemon

1829
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:08,000
Trebuchet.

1830
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:10,000
Metal Mayhem. Pokemon Tactical Nuke.

1831
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:12,000
Dark Tetsuya. Pokemon Helmet.

1832
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:14,000
All right guys calm down.

1833
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:16,000
So anyway we'll see what develops.

1834
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:18,000
I think in the

1835
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:20,000
long term I think people

1836
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:22,000
were kind of heard but gamers

1837
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:24,000
would rather hear now. They want

1838
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:26,000
to hear like oh there's going to be a patch that will

1839
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:28,000
fix all this. I just

1840
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:30,000
I don't think that's going to happen.

1841
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:32,000
If it does long term damage to the

1842
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:34,000
franchise or not that's what we'll see.

1843
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:36,000
That's going to be the real question

1844
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:38,000
and that's what I'm really dying

1845
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:40,000
to know the answer to. How

1846
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:42,000
is this going to impact sales at the end of the day?

1847
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:44,000
Because I bet there's a lot of

1848
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:46,000
people that are still going to buy the game because it's Pokemon even though

1849
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:48,000
they're pissed off. Yeah. I haven't really

1850
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:50,000
picked up a mainline Pokemon game

1851
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:52,000
like that. I've only done like

1852
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:54,000
you know let's go.

1853
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:56,000
I'll probably pick it up

1854
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:58,000
just because a new Pokemon

1855
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:00,000
Switch game like hell yeah I want to check it out.

1856
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:02,000
Like a new mainline game that's on a TV

1857
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:04,000
and portable console like for that alone

1858
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:06,000
I'm getting excited and some of the things they're doing.

1859
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:08,000
Doesn't mean I think they made the right decision

1860
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:10,000
but you know

1861
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:12,000
I still kind of want to check out what's there.

1862
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:14,000
So we'll see. Anyway.

1863
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:16,000
SSG 100

1864
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:18,000
Matt with a throwback here.

1865
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:20,000
Okay like two of you are going to get this joke.

1866
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:22,000
Pokemon peppermint time and mint.

1867
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:26,000
There's a great old joke in there.

1868
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:28,000
I'll leave it at that. Alright anyway.

1869
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:30,000
Moving on.

1870
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:32,000
Loki what do you have for us? Alright

1871
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:34,000
so this is kind of cool. So whereas

1872
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:36,000
we may have all these different

1873
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:40,000
platforms out there where we can purchase

1874
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:42,000
our games and kind of separating our libraries

1875
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:44,000
around. Good old games

1876
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:46,000
is trying to actually unite

1877
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:48,000
all of that together with GOG

1878
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:50,000
Galaxy 2.0.

1879
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:52,000
So GOG Galaxy 2.0 is in closed

1880
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:54,000
beta.

1881
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:56,000
But apparently their version of their client

1882
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:58,000
allows you to

1883
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:00,000
integrate

1884
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:02,000
other communities together.

1885
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:04,000
So for example right now

1886
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:06,000
GOG and Xbox Live are

1887
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:08,000
integrated but they're saying that Battle.net

1888
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:10,000
Epic, Origin, Playstation

1889
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:12,000
Network, Steam and Uplay

1890
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:14,000
are going to be available as

1891
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:16,000
community created

1892
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:18,000
integrations. And they said

1893
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:20,000
however these integrations

1894
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:22,000
function similarly

1895
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:24,000
allowing you to import games

1896
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:26,000
and depending on the platform

1897
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:28,000
achievements and other stuff.

1898
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:30,000
So they'll be able to have all of your

1899
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:32,000
game libraries together

1900
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:34,000
in one thing. I don't know

1901
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:36,000
if that means also being able to launch games

1902
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:38,000
from other platforms. Hopefully.

1903
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:40,000
So

1904
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:42,000
that would be cool if it was all in one place.

1905
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:44,000
I'm curious

1906
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:46,000
to check this out. It's in beta right now.

1907
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:50,000
Yo dog we heard you like launchers.

1908
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:52,000
So cross platform

1909
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:54,000
chat

1910
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:56,000
and one friends list.

1911
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:58,000
It's an interesting

1912
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:00,000
way for GOG to

1913
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:02,000
differentiate themselves

1914
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:04,000
from the competition by

1915
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:06,000
trying to be the good guy

1916
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:08,000
if you will. It's kind of

1917
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:10,000
interesting. The good old guy.

1918
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:12,000
That's what

1919
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:14,000
they're trying to do with this. It's your buddy.

1920
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:16,000
It's your buddy. Hey it's me

1921
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:18,000
it's GOG. You know how like your

1922
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:20,000
epic store and your steam and

1923
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:22,000
your battle net and Uplay

1924
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:24,000
and all that shit can't all get along.

1925
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:26,000
Well I'm here to help you get your shit sorted out.

1926
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:28,000
So I don't know. It sounds also

1927
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:30,000
to me very similar to like is it Apple

1928
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:32,000
TV. Oh no Playstation has

1929
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:34,000
this. Where if you go into like the

1930
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:36,000
TV movie thing on Playstation you

1931
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:38,000
can see like what movies are on what

1932
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:40,000
service. You know what I mean.

1933
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:42,000
That's kind of an interesting sort of

1934
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:44,000
approach to it.

1935
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:46,000
So and to be to be

1936
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:48,000
fair I haven't really used the GOG launcher

1937
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:50,000
in a while but this is something where

1938
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:52,000
I might go oh I'd be kind of curious to

1939
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:54,000
check this out. We'll see. So

1940
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:56,000
SSG100

1941
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:58,000
Matt points out yeah GOG needs

1942
01:47:58,000 --> 01:48:00,000
to work on being the good guy. Yeah

1943
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:02,000
because we know they've had some choice things

1944
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:04,000
with their social media. So yeah

1945
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:06,000
maybe this is a chance for them

1946
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:08,000
to rehab their image a little.

1947
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:10,000
Questbuster in chat says Microsoft's

1948
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:12,000
officially on board already. Well that's

1949
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:14,000
good news. That's always good when like the

1950
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:16,000
companies are like yeah we support this. And I'm

1951
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:18,000
sure from Microsoft's perspective they're like

1952
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:20,000
yeah another place for people to sign up for

1953
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:22,000
Game Pass. Hell yeah.

1954
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:24,000
So why not.

1955
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:26,000
I'm into it. I think it's a

1956
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:28,000
clever idea. So we'll see what happens. I mean yeah I do

1957
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:30,000
I have that Epic launcher.

1958
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:32,000
I have Steam. I have

1959
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:34,000
Battle.net that all are on my

1960
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:36,000
computer and I use pretty regularly.

1961
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:38,000
So I'm into the

1962
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:40,000
idea of something to bring them all together.

1963
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:42,000
It would be nice to be able to do that.

1964
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:44,000
Yeah. I'd like that with my VR library

1965
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:46,000
too. It would be nice.

1966
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:48,000
Darticuia does want to point out they've addressed the social

1967
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:50,000
media stuff that guy's gone as far as I know.

1968
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:52,000
OK. All right.

1969
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:54,000
Anyway let's

1970
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:56,000
move on and talk about

1971
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:58,000
Google Stadia. You know

1972
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:00,000
because Google Stadia are going to be

1973
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:02,000
games that essentially exist in the clouds.

1974
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:04,000
You're not going to be picking them up physically at all.

1975
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:06,000
Some people were wondering well will that

1976
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:08,000
be kind of reflected in the price. And the answer

1977
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:10,000
is no.

1978
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:12,000
So Google has clarified that

1979
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:14,000
games that are sold on Stadia will

1980
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:16,000
probably not be cheaper than they are

1981
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:18,000
on PlayStation 4 or Xbox

1982
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:20,000
One.

1983
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:22,000
So if you choose to buy games

1984
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:24,000
on Stadia you're probably going to be

1985
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:26,000
paying the 60 bucks or a comparable

1986
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:28,000
price to what you would pay on consoles. You know some games

1987
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:30,000
are 20 or 30 bucks just depending on what the game is.

1988
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:32,000
Phil Harrison in an interview

1989
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:34,000
with Eurogamer said quote

1990
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:36,000
I don't know why it would be cheaper.

1991
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:38,000
In the interview Harrison

1992
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:40,000
talks about that you have access

1993
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:42,000
to your purchase games on any screen that

1994
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:44,000
you own and therefore you have

1995
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:46,000
kind of maximum fidelity with that.

1996
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:48,000
So it's like you don't just have this one system that your

1997
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:50,000
game works on. You can use this game

1998
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:52,000
that you bought on your tablet on your phone

1999
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:54,000
on your PC right. So that's

2000
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:56,000
kind of the angle he's trying to sell it with which

2001
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:58,000
OK sure that's what Stadia is going to do.

2002
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:00,000
But yeah

2003
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:02,000
for that reason they do not see the prices

2004
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:04,000
on Stadia being cheaper.

2005
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:06,000
Also saying

2006
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:08,000
the publisher or the developer is in as

2007
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:10,000
much control of the prices as we are

2008
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:12,000
so it's a bit difficult for me to say what the prices

2009
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:14,000
will be right now. But we're obviously

2010
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:16,000
going to be very aware of prevailing

2011
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:18,000
prices in the marketplace.

2012
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:20,000
So as a reminder Google Stadia Pro

2013
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:22,000
launches on November

2014
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:24,000
19th and that's the one you have to pay a little

2015
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:26,000
money for the free version not

2016
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:28,000
anticipated until next

2017
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:30,000
year. So yeah

2018
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:32,000
there's a lot of comments in our chat

2019
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:34,000
not so nice about this

2020
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:36,000
Dejirama S says Google Stadia whack

2021
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:38,000
Cajudo says rent games

2022
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:40,000
for full price. Dr. Suya says

2023
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:42,000
yeah the more I hear about Stadia the more I'm thinking

2024
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:44,000
I'll just stick with my PC.

2025
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:46,000
Orange Right says pay for the privilege of remotely

2026
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:48,000
playing it. So

2027
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:50,000
I don't know. I hope Stadia is kind of

2028
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:52,000
listening to some of the feedback they're getting out there and plans

2029
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:54,000
to address it. But this could be a little bit like

2030
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:56,000
this could be dicey for them.

2031
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:58,000
I don't know.

2032
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:00,000
Well they also made the comment too how they

2033
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:02,000
were talking about the

2034
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:04,000
bandwidth caps. So people had

2035
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:06,000
concerns about bandwidth caps and

2036
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:08,000
that's not going to be something that's going to

2037
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:10,000
work well with these games and

2038
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:12,000
their response was what are you talking

2039
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:14,000
about. This is the cable industry

2040
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:16,000
we're talking about. They'll adapt. They'll

2041
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:18,000
loosen up bandwidth caps if

2042
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:20,000
people want Stadia

2043
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:22,000
and I'm like are you fucking stupid

2044
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:24,000
do you exist in this reality. Well

2045
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:26,000
I kind of I don't want to

2046
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:28,000
say I agree 100 percent. I agree

2047
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:30,000
with the direction

2048
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:32,000
but that like the market

2049
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:34,000
will hoot and holler

2050
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:36,000
and force cable companies to upgrade

2051
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:38,000
as the demand for more stuff comes in.

2052
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:40,000
But hold on let me finish. It's not

2053
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:42,000
going to happen next year. That's my point.

2054
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:44,000
Yeah. So the thing is is that

2055
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:46,000
Google needs to be prepared

2056
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:48,000
and I think for Stadia

2057
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:50,000
to succeed if they want Stadia to succeed

2058
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:52,000
Google needs to really be prepared

2059
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:54,000
to really hang on to this

2060
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:56,000
for five

2061
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:58,000
ten years.

2062
01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:00,000
I'm serious like

2063
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:02,000
because Google Stadia I don't see catching

2064
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:04,000
fire next year. But if Google

2065
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:06,000
is willing to stand by Stadia

2066
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:08,000
for five years ten years

2067
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:10,000
play the long game with this

2068
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:12,000
they might find success with it. They just

2069
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:14,000
well might because that will give enough time

2070
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:16,000
for the cable industry to catch up

2071
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:18,000
because that's when the 4K

2072
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:20,000
Netflix that's when that's going to get

2073
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:22,000
bigger and more and more people are streaming

2074
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:24,000
and that's really what's going to

2075
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:26,000
force the cable industry to look into upgrading

2076
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:28,000
and so forth.

2077
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:30,000
But if Google is going to just walk away

2078
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:32,000
from it if it flops in a year

2079
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:34,000
like Buzz

2080
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:36,000
or Google Plus or something like that

2081
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:38,000
then that's concerning. So what

2082
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:40,000
I would really like to hear

2083
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:42,000
is Google say we are committed

2084
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:44,000
to this for ten

2085
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:46,000
years. And I know

2086
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:48,000
that's a weird thing to ask a company to say

2087
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:50,000
but when you're Google I don't know if that is

2088
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:52,000
too crazy to ask. Especially with their track

2089
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:54,000
record. Yeah. Yeah. And folks in

2090
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:56,000
chat some folks kind of agreeing with me here

2091
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:58,000
saying Google will have to play

2092
01:52:58,000 --> 01:53:00,000
the long game which they don't always do well

2093
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:02,000
and active says spoilers they won't.

2094
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:04,000
So yeah not people not

2095
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:06,000
feeling too big on that especially

2096
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:08,000
after the news about Hangouts

2097
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:10,000
last last week or two weeks ago

2098
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:12,000
that Google Hangouts is sunsetting. That's

2099
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:14,000
that's a big fucking deal especially for

2100
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:16,000
podcasters. Yeah. So

2101
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:18,000
I would

2102
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:20,000
recommend if you are somebody that's in the Hangouts

2103
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:22,000
there are alternatives out there. I mean I guess

2104
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:24,000
Skype is something that's available and I'm sure

2105
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:26,000
Microsoft would love to eat this up. So hopefully

2106
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:28,000
you know they're they're looking into

2107
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:30,000
things. Zoom meetings

2108
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:32,000
I know is a way a lot of people do like video and

2109
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:34,000
talk to each other. But I think you have to pay for

2110
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:36,000
advance meetings on that.

2111
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:38,000
So there are alternatives out there. So if

2112
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:40,000
you are somebody that's relied on Google Hangouts

2113
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:42,000
start start exploring what some of your backups

2114
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:44,000
are. So anyway

2115
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:46,000
interesting while I are in

2116
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:48,000
chat says Microsoft is actually

2117
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:50,000
removing the e-book store

2118
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:52,000
and the e-book reading feature from

2119
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:54,000
Microsoft Edge. And in exchange

2120
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:56,000
they're refunding the full purchase

2121
01:53:56,000 --> 01:53:58,000
prices of all of the books you bought

2122
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:00,000
to your Microsoft account. Would Google

2123
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:02,000
do this.

2124
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:04,000
So no the answer is

2125
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:06,000
clearly no. So now what happens

2126
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:08,000
if Stadia goes under in a year you're going to get

2127
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:10,000
refunded for your games.

2128
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:12,000
Anyway that's that's the risk

2129
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:14,000
of buying digitally. Yeah

2130
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:16,000
and I just I just don't know if

2131
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:18,000
enough people are ready for it. I don't

2132
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:20,000
know I don't want to keep being negative on Stadia

2133
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:22,000
but it's just I just

2134
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:24,000
I think it's too right. It's too

2135
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:26,000
early. But maybe that's why pros coming out

2136
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:28,000
first let the people who really really want it

2137
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:30,000
and then let's see what exclusive

2138
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:32,000
games that they have that are must have

2139
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:34,000
you must that or whatever

2140
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:36,000
that too. All right. Moving on a few more

2141
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:38,000
stories that we're going to open up discord

2142
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:40,000
if you want to give us a call

2143
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:42,000
on our discord server at vognetwork.com

2144
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:44,000
slash discord you can do that. Just

2145
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:46,000
make your way to the green room on our

2146
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:48,000
discord server and a little blurb

2147
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:50,000
about what you'd like to talk about in our orange

2148
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:52,000
lounge radio channel will help you a

2149
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:54,000
lot. Again you're going to go to

2150
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:56,000
vognetwork.com

2151
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:58,000
vognetwork.com slash discord. If you're

2152
01:54:58,000 --> 01:55:00,000
feeling too shy and don't want to call in

2153
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:02,000
you can always ask stuff in our chat room as well

2154
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:04,000
and I will try my best to get to it.

2155
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:06,000
If it scrolls off screen

2156
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:08,000
make sure I'm able

2157
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:10,000
to get to that later. Remind me.

2158
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:12,000
But a few stories first before we get to that.

2159
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:14,000
So I've been keeping my eye

2160
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:16,000
on the LEGO Overwatch

2161
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:18,000
sets. I haven't purchased any

2162
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:20,000
I thought about it

2163
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:22,000
but you know they're expensive

2164
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:24,000
and it's hard to justify

2165
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:26,000
buying sets but I don't know

2166
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:28,000
these new ones are pretty cool so they've got

2167
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:30,000
two new sets that are coming out in October

2168
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:32,000
so one of them is going to be

2169
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:34,000
for Hammond in

2170
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:36,000
Wrecking Ball. Basically

2171
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:38,000
that looks fucking awesome.

2172
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:40,000
That one's only twenty bucks.

2173
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:42,000
I probably will pick that one up for

2174
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:44,000
twenty dollars. That seems really worth it for that.

2175
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:46,000
The other set that's coming out though

2176
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:48,000
is fifty dollars

2177
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:50,000
and it is both

2178
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:52,000
Junkrat and

2179
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:54,000
Roadhog

2180
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:56,000
and they have this giant

2181
01:55:56,000 --> 01:55:58,000
motorcycle thing.

2182
01:55:58,000 --> 01:56:00,000
That looks alright.

2183
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:02,000
I'm surprised though that that's so much more

2184
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:04,000
expensive just for

2185
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:06,000
what that is. Because of all the parts maybe

2186
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:08,000
that make up that big Katamari looking thing.

2187
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:10,000
It's three hundred and eighty parts

2188
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:12,000
versus the

2189
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:14,000
Wrecking Ball one which is

2190
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:16,000
two hundred and twenty seven. Those are relatively small sets

2191
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:18,000
but like three hundred and eighty for

2192
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:20,000
fifty dollars

2193
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:22,000
is so expensive. That Wrecking Ball one

2194
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:24,000
is super fucking cute though. It is. I will have

2195
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:26,000
to probably pick that up. That's like the perfect

2196
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:28,000
like little like desk

2197
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:30,000
thing. That's where I put them. Yeah.

2198
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:32,000
The place I used to

2199
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:34,000
get some of my

2200
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:36,000
knock off sets. They

2201
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:38,000
have these custom

2202
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:40,000
brick heads of all the

2203
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:42,000
Overwatch characters. And so

2204
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:44,000
I'm thinking about getting those instead of the

2205
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:46,000
Overwatch sets but

2206
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:48,000
I do want that Wrecking Ball set

2207
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:50,000
that looks pretty awesome. Yeah.

2208
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:52,000
Maybe not. Maybe the Roadhog one but

2209
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:54,000
definitely the Wrecking Ball one.

2210
01:56:54,000 --> 01:56:56,000
Yeah.

2211
01:56:56,000 --> 01:56:58,000
It took me four hours to build

2212
01:56:58,000 --> 01:57:00,000
Red Heart and Diva together. So yeah it's a good

2213
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:02,000
it's a good project. Right.

2214
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:04,000
Yeah. That one was also another

2215
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:06,000
I almost got that one too. That was the one I was

2216
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:08,000
kind of interested in but

2217
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:10,000
we'll see.

2218
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:12,000
Alright. Well moving on

2219
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:14,000
for our last story tonight which you know

2220
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:16,000
I know is a big part of many of your weeks

2221
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:18,000
because a lot of Twitch watchers

2222
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:20,000
and a lot of like gamers out there love to watch

2223
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:22,000
some summer games done quick.

2224
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:24,000
And of course the whole thing I mean it is about

2225
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:26,000
speed running games but it is done for

2226
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:28,000
charity. And it should be

2227
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:30,000
pointed out and this is really awesome is

2228
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:32,000
that summer games done quick

2229
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:34,000
shattered fundraising this year.

2230
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:36,000
They for the first time passed

2231
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:38,000
the three million dollar mark.

2232
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:40,000
And the charity that

2233
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:42,000
they raised money for this year was Doctors

2234
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:44,000
Without Borders. That is more

2235
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:46,000
than 900,000 in the

2236
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:48,000
previous year. So that's amazing.

2237
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:50,000
That's amazing. If you were actually

2238
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:52,000
there in Minneapolis Minnesota about

2239
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:54,000
2,600 people were there in person

2240
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:56,000
and they say the peak of the Twitch streams

2241
01:57:56,000 --> 01:57:58,000
was 156,000

2242
01:57:58,000 --> 01:58:00,000
viewers. So that's

2243
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:02,000
that's great. Congratulations

2244
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:04,000
to everybody involved with the

2245
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:06,000
games done quick. If you want to watch

2246
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:08,000
archives is available on the YouTube of course

2247
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:10,000
and the final

2248
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:12,000
final I'm using my quoting numbers as of

2249
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:14,000
the time of this report was three

2250
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:16,000
three million five thousand

2251
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:18,000
two hundred twenty eight dollars. But I believe the donations

2252
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:20,000
still kind of you can still donate for a little

2253
01:58:20,000 --> 01:58:22,000
while afterwards. I mean hello it's charity

2254
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:24,000
fundraising. They're going to let you do that for a good long time.

2255
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:26,000
Anyway there will be

2256
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:28,000
there will be a games done quick

2257
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:30,000
express in September

2258
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:32,000
at Twitch Con. The next

2259
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:34,000
big show though is going to be Awesome

2260
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:36,000
Done Quick 2020 in January

2261
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:38,000
and that is going to be the 10 year

2262
01:58:38,000 --> 01:58:40,000
anniversary of

2263
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:42,000
the show.

2264
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:44,000
That's very exciting. I really like watching

2265
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:46,000
these each year and I love catching up on

2266
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:48,000
everything on YouTube.

2267
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:50,000
Just because I'm not able to obviously

2268
01:58:50,000 --> 01:58:52,000
in 24 hours a day

2269
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:54,000
to catch all these things.

2270
01:58:54,000 --> 01:58:56,000
I watched was it the Zelda randomizer

2271
01:58:56,000 --> 01:58:58,000
earlier this week. I was

2272
01:58:58,000 --> 01:59:00,000
watching the Taskbot stuff earlier

2273
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:02,000
today the Mario Kart Wii.

2274
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:04,000
I watched parts the last

2275
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:06,000
but I didn't have enough time to get through like all of that

2276
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:08,000
and

2277
01:59:08,000 --> 01:59:10,000
just yeah a lot of

2278
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:12,000
a lot of that stuff is just really interesting to watch

2279
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:14,000
the runs of those and so

2280
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:16,000
I wish they would do it more often than twice a year

2281
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:18,000
but I understand organizing. It makes it a little

2282
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:20,000
more special when they do it twice a year.

2283
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:22,000
And you know if you want to see speed runs people are

2284
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:24,000
speed running stuff on Twitch all of the time.

2285
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:26,000
And AG

2286
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:28,000
I want to say Games Done Quick does other things

2287
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:30,000
throughout the year. They have

2288
01:59:30,000 --> 01:59:32,000
mini races and stuff like that

2289
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:34,000
that they'll do on those channels.

2290
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:36,000
So there's stuff out there

2291
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:38,000
that kind of

2292
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:40,000
in between all of that but

2293
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:42,000
I do like those events and

2294
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:44,000
it is sad that it's only twice a year

2295
01:59:44,000 --> 01:59:46,000
but I understand why.

2296
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:48,000
At least they're doing these mini things too

2297
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:50,000
between TwitchCon and all that stuff as well.

2298
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:52,000
Anyway we are going

2299
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:54,000
to go to our Discord

2300
01:59:54,000 --> 01:59:56,000
server and start to take some calls

2301
01:59:56,000 --> 01:59:58,000
in our listener roundtable and if you have questions in our chat

2302
01:59:58,000 --> 02:00:00,000
room you can certainly do that as well over at

2303
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:02,000
twitch.tv slash vog network.

2304
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:04,000
I know we have somebody already on the line. I have a

2305
02:00:04,000 --> 02:00:06,000
feeling this might tie into our last story so let's go to the

2306
02:00:06,000 --> 02:00:08,000
phone. Hi you are on Orange Launch Radio

2307
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:10,000
who's this?

2308
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:14,000
Hello you are on Orange Launch Radio who's

2309
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:16,000
this? Uh oh I think

2310
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:18,000
did I drag and drop them into the wrong? Let's try that again.

2311
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:20,000
Hi you are on Orange Launch Radio who's this?

2312
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:24,000
If you can hear me you are currently

2313
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:26,000
muted. I see the mute icon.

2314
02:00:26,000 --> 02:00:28,000
So you might want to unmute.

2315
02:00:28,000 --> 02:00:30,000
Yay I figured it out.

2316
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:32,000
You got it. It is

2317
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:34,000
our voice over man Jason

2318
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:36,000
who is

2319
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:38,000
Well on most weeks anyways. Yeah not tonight.

2320
02:00:38,000 --> 02:00:40,000
I had the good old generic intro because even I

2321
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:42,000
was so freaking busy. We've all had busy weeks.

2322
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:44,000
But how are you my friend?

2323
02:00:44,000 --> 02:00:46,000
You were at you were one of those

2324
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:48,000
2,600 people at SGDQ right?

2325
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:50,000
I was one of those

2326
02:00:50,000 --> 02:00:52,000
2,600 people at GDQ.

2327
02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:54,000
I was one of those oh geez

2328
02:00:54,000 --> 02:00:56,000
what was it 70 names in the credits

2329
02:00:56,000 --> 02:00:58,000
at the very end of the show? Oh

2330
02:00:58,000 --> 02:01:00,000
cool. I didn't I didn't realize they did

2331
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:02,000
they did the credits at the I wasn't able to watch

2332
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:04,000
the end of it so just because

2333
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:06,000
because I've been LARPing I haven't been

2334
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:08,000
able to really watch any of the streams

2335
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:10,000
I'll have to go back and do it on YouTube so

2336
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:12,000
Yeah they if you

2337
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:14,000
I assume you can go back and I don't

2338
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:16,000
know if they'll put it on YouTube

2339
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:18,000
if they'll just kind of like attach it to the

2340
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:20,000
Kruger run but certainly if you go

2341
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:22,000
back and watch the past broadcast

2342
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:24,000
of the very end of the Twitch stream

2343
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:26,000
they had a little

2344
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:28,000
sizzle reel for the

2345
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:30,000
for the end of the show talking about

2346
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:32,000
what it is what they did and

2347
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:34,000
then they had a credit sequence of

2348
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:36,000
all of the staff and all of the volunteers

2349
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:38,000
for the occasion as well.

2350
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:40,000
Well so I'm dying to know

2351
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:42,000
how was your first experience

2352
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:44,000
there because you know it said

2353
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:46,000
156,000 were watching

2354
02:01:46,000 --> 02:01:48,000
at the peak on Twitch but only

2355
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:50,000
2,600 are there

2356
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:52,000
in person obviously this is a big

2357
02:01:52,000 --> 02:01:54,000
you know fundraiser across

2358
02:01:54,000 --> 02:01:56,000
you know virtual channels and television

2359
02:01:56,000 --> 02:01:58,000
stuff but I imagine the experience of being

2360
02:01:58,000 --> 02:02:00,000
there is something very few

2361
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:02,000
of the viewers have experienced so I'm kind

2362
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:04,000
of curious what did you think seeing it from this

2363
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:06,000
side this time? Yeah

2364
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:08,000
and a lot of people

2365
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:10,000
sis as a recurring theme you

2366
02:02:10,000 --> 02:02:12,000
go to any other prominent

2367
02:02:12,000 --> 02:02:14,000
convention any anime convention

2368
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:16,000
any gaming convention

2369
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:18,000
on the tier of TwitchCon

2370
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:20,000
on the tier of even like

2371
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:22,000
the ComicCon series

2372
02:02:22,000 --> 02:02:24,000
or the PopCultureCon series

2373
02:02:24,000 --> 02:02:26,000
as Denver recently renamed to

2374
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:28,000
you go to any other convention that is

2375
02:02:28,000 --> 02:02:30,000
intended to pull

2376
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:32,000
big crowds to pull big

2377
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:34,000
names to pull bigger crowds

2378
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:36,000
to pull bigger names

2379
02:02:36,000 --> 02:02:38,000
and you have this critical mass

2380
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:40,000
of everything in fun culture

2381
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:42,000
where because this is a

2382
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:44,000
deliberately limited

2383
02:02:44,000 --> 02:02:46,000
event in physical

2384
02:02:46,000 --> 02:02:48,000
participation

2385
02:02:48,000 --> 02:02:50,000
yeah it's at a very

2386
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:52,000
very reasonable number and then

2387
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:54,000
you take that 2,600

2388
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:56,000
you slice it up between people

2389
02:02:56,000 --> 02:02:58,000
that aren't there for the whole week

2390
02:02:58,000 --> 02:03:00,000
people that go there for friends

2391
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:02,000
the sheer number of like

2392
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:04,000
24 hour event people that are more night

2393
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:06,000
owls people that are more morning people that are

2394
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:08,000
more daytime and you have

2395
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:10,000
this really comfortable

2396
02:03:10,000 --> 02:03:12,000
spread where

2397
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:14,000
even though it only takes place on the

2398
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:16,000
single floor of a hotel it

2399
02:03:16,000 --> 02:03:18,000
still like

2400
02:03:18,000 --> 02:03:20,000
flows smoothly enough

2401
02:03:20,000 --> 02:03:22,000
because of the deliberate

2402
02:03:22,000 --> 02:03:24,000
limiting

2403
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:26,000
and I should point out Jason

2404
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:28,000
is on the road right now so his

2405
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:30,000
audio may drop a little bit in and out

2406
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:32,000
as it's doing right now Jason sorry I

2407
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:34,000
don't know if the connection is stabilizing there can you hear us

2408
02:03:34,000 --> 02:03:36,000
yeah I can hear you just fine

2409
02:03:36,000 --> 02:03:38,000
you're just cutting in where are

2410
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:40,000
you right now on the road

2411
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:42,000
I am currently in Nebraska

2412
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:44,000
ok well

2413
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:46,000
the Nebraska internet is

2414
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:48,000
a little wonky but that's alright

2415
02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:50,000
so yeah

2416
02:03:50,000 --> 02:03:52,000
that's an interesting point is that that number is really

2417
02:03:52,000 --> 02:03:54,000
kind of spread out because it's such a long

2418
02:03:54,000 --> 02:03:56,000
convention and so forth by the

2419
02:03:56,000 --> 02:03:58,000
way you're getting a lot of love in our chat room

2420
02:03:58,000 --> 02:04:00,000
for folks saying Jason has the

2421
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:02,000
SJ100 Matt says Jason has the voice

2422
02:04:02,000 --> 02:04:04,000
to be a donation announcer not

2423
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:06,000
sure why they didn't catch that

2424
02:04:06,000 --> 02:04:08,000
and then let's see Questbuster

2425
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:10,000
says seriously he'd be great as an announcer

2426
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:12,000
hashtag future

2427
02:04:12,000 --> 02:04:14,000
goals so

2428
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:16,000
it's a funny funny story like

2429
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:18,000
when you when you sign

2430
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:20,000
up to be a volunteer

2431
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:22,000
you what

2432
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:24,000
they what they actually did first time this year

2433
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:26,000
and specifically for SGDQ

2434
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:28,000
was people applying to

2435
02:04:28,000 --> 02:04:30,000
be a host actually did a little

2436
02:04:30,000 --> 02:04:32,000
audition they got

2437
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:34,000
Zenny I forgot

2438
02:04:34,000 --> 02:04:36,000
his whole username but they got a

2439
02:04:36,000 --> 02:04:38,000
Super Metroid runner to make a generic

2440
02:04:38,000 --> 02:04:40,000
five minute video and then

2441
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:42,000
they gave a bunch of kind of

2442
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:44,000
sample sample

2443
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:46,000
donations to see if you can spot

2444
02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:48,000
to gauge

2445
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:50,000
your ability to read comfortably

2446
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:52,000
but also to make sure that you're not just

2447
02:04:52,000 --> 02:04:54,000
going to blurt out there was actually one

2448
02:04:54,000 --> 02:04:56,000
suggested donation comment

2449
02:04:56,000 --> 02:04:58,000
that said

2450
02:04:58,000 --> 02:05:00,000
acted like it was talking about a

2451
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:02,000
character in the metro universe but was

2452
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:04,000
actually making a racist reference

2453
02:05:04,000 --> 02:05:06,000
so even though donation

2454
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:08,000
screening is a thing is another

2455
02:05:08,000 --> 02:05:10,000
role they also want to make sure that

2456
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:12,000
hosts are reasonable with content

2457
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:14,000
and checking and

2458
02:05:14,000 --> 02:05:16,000
and apply you know that much

2459
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:18,000
to the universe and they're not just

2460
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:20,000
literally reading off a script because the

2461
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:22,000
point of the host is is to is to

2462
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:24,000
host is to is to be the voice

2463
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:26,000
I apply and

2464
02:05:26,000 --> 02:05:28,000
to be a host I was just outside the

2465
02:05:28,000 --> 02:05:30,000
bubble and I think one of the

2466
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:32,000
biggest reasons why I got a little bit of feedback

2467
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:34,000
that was a little weirdly mixed

2468
02:05:34,000 --> 02:05:36,000
but one of the things that was a

2469
02:05:36,000 --> 02:05:38,000
silly idea in

2470
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:40,000
in hindsight of my own decision was

2471
02:05:40,000 --> 02:05:42,000
that I called it super

2472
02:05:42,000 --> 02:05:44,000
games done quick which has not

2473
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:46,000
been the name for a good couple of years

2474
02:05:46,000 --> 02:05:48,000
and I was kind of

2475
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:50,000
it was kind of a you know on the nose

2476
02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:52,000
flashing my OG

2477
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:54,000
status or some crap like

2478
02:05:54,000 --> 02:05:56,000
that despite the fact that this was the first time I

2479
02:05:56,000 --> 02:05:58,000
attended but that was a

2480
02:05:58,000 --> 02:06:00,000
detriment because I'm running the show

2481
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:02,000
and as the host you

2482
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:04,000
have to push the details

2483
02:06:04,000 --> 02:06:06,000
admittedly when you're on the show you have a

2484
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:08,000
producer in your ear you're dealing with the crowd

2485
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:10,000
the hosts banter with

2486
02:06:10,000 --> 02:06:12,000
the runner and those sorts of things like

2487
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:14,000
you're getting all this feedback but it's

2488
02:06:14,000 --> 02:06:16,000
still important that you're in the

2489
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:18,000
culture to begin with

2490
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:20,000
I met

2491
02:06:20,000 --> 02:06:22,000
a sporadic erratic

2492
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:24,000
that did the

2493
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:26,000
chrono trigger that was the host for that

2494
02:06:26,000 --> 02:06:28,000
final run I met her at that orientation

2495
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:30,000
and then bantered with her

2496
02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:32,000
throughout the week and then talked to her after

2497
02:06:32,000 --> 02:06:34,000
after it was all said and done

2498
02:06:34,000 --> 02:06:36,000
and she got that shift

2499
02:06:36,000 --> 02:06:38,000
because she was very much

2500
02:06:38,000 --> 02:06:40,000
in with those

2501
02:06:40,000 --> 02:06:42,000
runners and considering

2502
02:06:42,000 --> 02:06:44,000
that she sang Gato's

2503
02:06:44,000 --> 02:06:46,000
song or Gonzalez's

2504
02:06:46,000 --> 02:06:48,000
song as it was

2505
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:50,000
in Japanese like

2506
02:06:50,000 --> 02:06:52,000
that's a distinct

2507
02:06:52,000 --> 02:06:54,000
quality that just

2508
02:06:54,000 --> 02:06:56,000
fucking shined for her that was

2509
02:06:56,000 --> 02:06:58,000
truly incredible and you get

2510
02:06:58,000 --> 02:07:00,000
that with like the

2511
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:02,000
I don't remember the host

2512
02:07:02,000 --> 02:07:04,000
for the

2513
02:07:04,000 --> 02:07:06,000
Super Metroid Zelda combo

2514
02:07:06,000 --> 02:07:08,000
combo co-op but like

2515
02:07:08,000 --> 02:07:10,000
that's the strength of

2516
02:07:10,000 --> 02:07:12,000
submitting to be a host is not

2517
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:14,000
just your capability to do that production

2518
02:07:14,000 --> 02:07:16,000
but also to

2519
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:18,000
had to be in a community

2520
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:20,000
and to be able to be

2521
02:07:20,000 --> 02:07:22,000
part of the presentation be part

2522
02:07:22,000 --> 02:07:24,000
of the show as it's being done

2523
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:26,000
where possible with the runner get

2524
02:07:26,000 --> 02:07:28,000
accepted to the show and everything else like that so

2525
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:30,000
I did apply to be a host I did not get

2526
02:07:30,000 --> 02:07:32,000
accepted as many people no doubt

2527
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:34,000
saw I got my

2528
02:07:34,000 --> 02:07:36,000
second choice which was enforcement which was

2529
02:07:36,000 --> 02:07:38,000
bag checking just

2530
02:07:38,000 --> 02:07:40,000
waiting food from the floor I

2531
02:07:40,000 --> 02:07:42,000
did a bunch of cleanup of the stream

2532
02:07:42,000 --> 02:07:44,000
multiple times picking up latent cups

2533
02:07:44,000 --> 02:07:46,000
and all that kind of all that kind of nonsense

2534
02:07:46,000 --> 02:07:48,000
I

2535
02:07:48,000 --> 02:07:50,000
got relatively easy shifts as well

2536
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:52,000
they were all 8 a.m. to noon

2537
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:54,000
based off the

2538
02:07:54,000 --> 02:07:56,000
based off the discussion that was happening

2539
02:07:56,000 --> 02:07:58,000
in the in the volunteers channel

2540
02:07:58,000 --> 02:08:00,000
things were a little dicey

2541
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:02,000
earlier in the night because you get the

2542
02:08:02,000 --> 02:08:04,000
2 a.m. 3 a.m. drunkie

2543
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:06,000
shenanigans and then just kind of

2544
02:08:06,000 --> 02:08:08,000
the more critical mass

2545
02:08:08,000 --> 02:08:10,000
in the afternoon hours and those

2546
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:12,000
sorts of things my job was

2547
02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:14,000
relatively easy all things concerned

2548
02:08:14,000 --> 02:08:16,000
but the entirety of being

2549
02:08:16,000 --> 02:08:18,000
a volunteer with GDQ was a great

2550
02:08:18,000 --> 02:08:20,000
experience not

2551
02:08:20,000 --> 02:08:22,000
only not only because this

2552
02:08:22,000 --> 02:08:24,000
was my first time attending

2553
02:08:24,000 --> 02:08:26,000
and I also got to be part of the production

2554
02:08:26,000 --> 02:08:28,000
but also just to be able to see

2555
02:08:28,000 --> 02:08:30,000
what's happening on a technical level

2556
02:08:30,000 --> 02:08:32,000
interact with the staff meet the staff

2557
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:34,000
everything that they put into it

2558
02:08:34,000 --> 02:08:36,000
on a technical level both in

2559
02:08:36,000 --> 02:08:38,000
discord generally where volunteers

2560
02:08:38,000 --> 02:08:40,000
chat in slack specifically

2561
02:08:40,000 --> 02:08:42,000
because that gives us enforcement

2562
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:44,000
a little bit more granular

2563
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:46,000
discussion to be able to shout out a staff

2564
02:08:46,000 --> 02:08:48,000
member if we need additional

2565
02:08:48,000 --> 02:08:50,000
intervention and those sorts of things

2566
02:08:50,000 --> 02:08:52,000
and then

2567
02:08:52,000 --> 02:08:54,000
everything that goes on on the stage

2568
02:08:54,000 --> 02:08:56,000
being able to banter being able

2569
02:08:56,000 --> 02:08:58,000
to meet and talk to the people on

2570
02:08:58,000 --> 02:09:00,000
the other on the other occasions

2571
02:09:00,000 --> 02:09:02,000
there there was some discussion

2572
02:09:02,000 --> 02:09:04,000
about more

2573
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:06,000
significantly known personalities

2574
02:09:06,000 --> 02:09:08,000
in other roles that enforcement

2575
02:09:08,000 --> 02:09:10,000
kind of had to come in and

2576
02:09:10,000 --> 02:09:12,000
come in

2577
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:14,000
serve their purpose serve their role to

2578
02:09:14,000 --> 02:09:16,000
dissuade to dissuade

2579
02:09:16,000 --> 02:09:18,000
the nonsense that does

2580
02:09:18,000 --> 02:09:20,000
happen just not in large

2581
02:09:20,000 --> 02:09:22,000
numbers again because of the limited

2582
02:09:22,000 --> 02:09:24,000
nature of the events

2583
02:09:24,000 --> 02:09:26,000
but it's like it's it is a

2584
02:09:26,000 --> 02:09:28,000
I

2585
02:09:28,000 --> 02:09:30,000
love the fact that

2586
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:32,000
it is infrequent

2587
02:09:32,000 --> 02:09:34,000
as it is with the most

2588
02:09:34,000 --> 02:09:36,000
notable events being

2589
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:38,000
AGDQ GDQ and GDQ express

2590
02:09:38,000 --> 02:09:40,000
but

2591
02:09:40,000 --> 02:09:42,000
also to their benefit they're also

2592
02:09:42,000 --> 02:09:44,000
doing things like frame fatales

2593
02:09:44,000 --> 02:09:46,000
that they did back in May

2594
02:09:46,000 --> 02:09:48,000
hot fixes both interviews and

2595
02:09:48,000 --> 02:09:50,000
runs and special sorts of things

2596
02:09:50,000 --> 02:09:52,000
to kind of keep

2597
02:09:52,000 --> 02:09:54,000
a modicum of

2598
02:09:54,000 --> 02:09:56,000
interest in between these sorts of events

2599
02:09:56,000 --> 02:09:58,000
but this is truly

2600
02:09:58,000 --> 02:10:00,000
becoming

2601
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:02,000
they're they're stepping up content

2602
02:10:02,000 --> 02:10:04,000
where possible and always

2603
02:10:04,000 --> 02:10:06,000
continuing to be done

2604
02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:08,000
for good causes which

2605
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:10,000
as long as that's the number one

2606
02:10:10,000 --> 02:10:12,000
goal and drives

2607
02:10:12,000 --> 02:10:14,000
their drives

2608
02:10:14,000 --> 02:10:16,000
what they are capable of doing

2609
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:18,000
they're going to

2610
02:10:18,000 --> 02:10:20,000
you know produce just enough content to

2611
02:10:20,000 --> 02:10:22,000
be relevant and continue to do it for

2612
02:10:22,000 --> 02:10:24,000
for spectacular reasons

2613
02:10:24,000 --> 02:10:26,000
you know it's and the

2614
02:10:26,000 --> 02:10:28,000
game's done quick brand is really kind of like

2615
02:10:28,000 --> 02:10:30,000
set the bar in a lot of categories

2616
02:10:30,000 --> 02:10:32,000
kind of like you know like like you know and continue

2617
02:10:32,000 --> 02:10:34,000
to raise that bar in you know not just like

2618
02:10:34,000 --> 02:10:36,000
what what is a good

2619
02:10:36,000 --> 02:10:38,000
speed running stream kind of look like

2620
02:10:38,000 --> 02:10:40,000
what does good commentating on a speed running

2621
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:42,000
stream look like but just the ends of how do

2622
02:10:42,000 --> 02:10:44,000
you how do you run an effective charity stream

2623
02:10:44,000 --> 02:10:46,000
I mean especially the amount

2624
02:10:46,000 --> 02:10:48,000
that they they raised

2625
02:10:48,000 --> 02:10:50,000
I mean it's just a huge testament

2626
02:10:50,000 --> 02:10:52,000
to this formula that they've refined

2627
02:10:52,000 --> 02:10:54,000
over there coming up on 10 year existence

2628
02:10:54,000 --> 02:10:56,000
that I think just really speaks to

2629
02:10:56,000 --> 02:10:58,000
you know the hard work that all these volunteers are putting in

2630
02:10:58,000 --> 02:11:00,000
year round even if we're lamenting that

2631
02:11:00,000 --> 02:11:02,000
you know it only happens twice a year it

2632
02:11:02,000 --> 02:11:04,000
sounds like that you know production yeah they're working

2633
02:11:04,000 --> 02:11:06,000
to year round to really make it a type

2634
02:11:06,000 --> 02:11:08,000
of production some

2635
02:11:08,000 --> 02:11:10,000
pick up comments in our chat here quest buster says

2636
02:11:10,000 --> 02:11:12,000
Jason's leveled up his diplomacy skill

2637
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:14,000
at SGDQ and

2638
02:11:14,000 --> 02:11:16,000
as soon as Matt says they also did a

2639
02:11:16,000 --> 02:11:18,000
few pickup streams for to benefit

2640
02:11:18,000 --> 02:11:20,000
disasters which is also great oh that's

2641
02:11:20,000 --> 02:11:22,000
that's definitely true yeah that's

2642
02:11:22,000 --> 02:11:24,000
right the the Hurricane Maria

2643
02:11:24,000 --> 02:11:26,000
stuff it was that earlier

2644
02:11:26,000 --> 02:11:28,000
jeez I don't even remember when that happened but yeah I

2645
02:11:28,000 --> 02:11:30,000
completely forgot about the

2646
02:11:30,000 --> 02:11:32,000
both the Houston flooding last

2647
02:11:32,000 --> 02:11:34,000
year as well as Hurricane Mary

2648
02:11:34,000 --> 02:11:36,000
and those sorts of disaster

2649
02:11:36,000 --> 02:11:38,000
really yeah I had I completely

2650
02:11:38,000 --> 02:11:40,000
forgotten about those without that being

2651
02:11:40,000 --> 02:11:42,000
mentioned they're being brought up

2652
02:11:42,000 --> 02:11:44,000
Jason let me ask you this since it was

2653
02:11:44,000 --> 02:11:46,000
a year that really raised the bar in many

2654
02:11:46,000 --> 02:11:48,000
ways what was the mood in the

2655
02:11:48,000 --> 02:11:50,000
room like when y'all heard you

2656
02:11:50,000 --> 02:11:52,000
hit that three million mark

2657
02:11:52,000 --> 02:11:54,000
so truth be

2658
02:11:54,000 --> 02:11:56,000
told I actually was not in the

2659
02:11:56,000 --> 02:11:58,000
stream room for the finale something

2660
02:11:58,000 --> 02:12:00,000
that was super fun was that they

2661
02:12:00,000 --> 02:12:02,000
actually had GDQ broadcasting

2662
02:12:02,000 --> 02:12:04,000
on one of the in hotel channels

2663
02:12:04,000 --> 02:12:06,000
so as long as you were in the same

2664
02:12:06,000 --> 02:12:08,000
DoubleTree hotel as the event you could

2665
02:12:08,000 --> 02:12:10,000
just tune in and watch from the comfort of your room

2666
02:12:10,000 --> 02:12:12,000
which I was doing because my

2667
02:12:12,000 --> 02:12:14,000
sleep schedule was very upside down

2668
02:12:14,000 --> 02:12:16,000
because waking up at

2669
02:12:16,000 --> 02:12:18,000
7 a.m. for an 8 a.m.

2670
02:12:18,000 --> 02:12:20,000
shift oh man I yeah

2671
02:12:20,000 --> 02:12:22,000
I needless to say I was just up

2672
02:12:22,000 --> 02:12:24,000
literally all night did the shift and then

2673
02:12:24,000 --> 02:12:26,000
knocked out for the day so I got

2674
02:12:26,000 --> 02:12:28,000
comfortable and I'm not I'm not I'm not

2675
02:12:28,000 --> 02:12:30,000
truth be told I am not a huge

2676
02:12:30,000 --> 02:12:32,000
fan of being in that

2677
02:12:32,000 --> 02:12:34,000
type of a situation like with that

2678
02:12:34,000 --> 02:12:36,000
the critical mass of people

2679
02:12:36,000 --> 02:12:38,000
as much as it is it's still a room

2680
02:12:38,000 --> 02:12:40,000
packed full standing room

2681
02:12:40,000 --> 02:12:42,000
only of the of the streamer

2682
02:12:42,000 --> 02:12:44,000
for the very thing so

2683
02:12:44,000 --> 02:12:46,000
truth be told I only saw it

2684
02:12:46,000 --> 02:12:48,000
like I did the rest of you however

2685
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:50,000
I did go downstairs

2686
02:12:50,000 --> 02:12:52,000
immediately on the conclusion

2687
02:12:52,000 --> 02:12:54,000
because that way I could I could seek out

2688
02:12:54,000 --> 02:12:56,000
friends like I said I was talking to

2689
02:12:56,000 --> 02:12:58,000
Miss sporadic immediately

2690
02:12:58,000 --> 02:13:00,000
afterwards as well and I was talking to

2691
02:13:00,000 --> 02:13:02,000
some of the some of the specific

2692
02:13:02,000 --> 02:13:04,000
failures that were going on during her

2693
02:13:04,000 --> 02:13:06,000
shift I don't know if anybody

2694
02:13:06,000 --> 02:13:08,000
else noticed this but she accidentally

2695
02:13:08,000 --> 02:13:10,000
left the mic on

2696
02:13:10,000 --> 02:13:12,000
it was about an hour

2697
02:13:12,000 --> 02:13:14,000
and a half before

2698
02:13:14,000 --> 02:13:16,000
the finale but before the end of

2699
02:13:16,000 --> 02:13:18,000
that run or something like that she

2700
02:13:18,000 --> 02:13:20,000
inadvertently left the mic on and she

2701
02:13:20,000 --> 02:13:22,000
was actually just talking to

2702
02:13:22,000 --> 02:13:24,000
the hosting coordinator right over

2703
02:13:24,000 --> 02:13:26,000
her shoulder that was like I don't think

2704
02:13:26,000 --> 02:13:28,000
we're gonna it was it was either for a

2705
02:13:28,000 --> 02:13:30,000
donation incentive or something like that but she was just kind of like

2706
02:13:30,000 --> 02:13:32,000
I don't think we're gonna make this one

2707
02:13:32,000 --> 02:13:34,000
and she

2708
02:13:34,000 --> 02:13:36,000
said it so quick and then she realized

2709
02:13:36,000 --> 02:13:38,000
that she heard it back to the headset and she immediately

2710
02:13:38,000 --> 02:13:40,000
just I am so

2711
02:13:40,000 --> 02:13:42,000
sorry about that and then

2712
02:13:42,000 --> 02:13:44,000
and then killed her headset I

2713
02:13:44,000 --> 02:13:46,000
killed the microphone

2714
02:13:46,000 --> 02:13:48,000
so I got a little bit of

2715
02:13:48,000 --> 02:13:50,000
chuckle out of that and then I ribbed her for it because we were

2716
02:13:50,000 --> 02:13:52,000
like I said we were talking a little bit and just

2717
02:13:52,000 --> 02:13:54,000
maybe it motivated

2718
02:13:54,000 --> 02:13:56,000
the internet out of spite to make that goal

2719
02:13:56,000 --> 02:13:58,000
happen

2720
02:13:58,000 --> 02:14:00,000
she said exactly the same thing and like

2721
02:14:00,000 --> 02:14:02,000
there's no there's no formula for this stuff she was

2722
02:14:02,000 --> 02:14:04,000
a little bit for having

2723
02:14:04,000 --> 02:14:06,000
to push so many

2724
02:14:06,000 --> 02:14:08,000
incentives because there were like

2725
02:14:08,000 --> 02:14:10,000
there were like 10 different incentives for Corona Trigger

2726
02:14:10,000 --> 02:14:12,000
alone naming every single

2727
02:14:12,000 --> 02:14:14,000
character plus a hundred percent

2728
02:14:14,000 --> 02:14:16,000
plus the three million push

2729
02:14:16,000 --> 02:14:18,000
just in general at the end

2730
02:14:18,000 --> 02:14:20,000
plus

2731
02:14:20,000 --> 02:14:22,000
Speccio

2732
02:14:22,000 --> 02:14:24,000
Speccio in the new battles

2733
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:26,000
just like so many

2734
02:14:26,000 --> 02:14:28,000
incentives at the very very end that were just

2735
02:14:28,000 --> 02:14:30,000
absolutely ridiculous

2736
02:14:30,000 --> 02:14:32,000
to ground

2737
02:14:32,000 --> 02:14:34,000
all this money at the end but it was

2738
02:14:34,000 --> 02:14:36,000
it was truly remarkable it was truly

2739
02:14:36,000 --> 02:14:38,000
an event and they dropped in

2740
02:14:38,000 --> 02:14:40,000
they dropped in sponsorship

2741
02:14:40,000 --> 02:14:42,000
and Yeti and all that and all

2742
02:14:42,000 --> 02:14:44,000
that money I think twitch stuff

2743
02:14:44,000 --> 02:14:46,000
happens automatically

2744
02:14:46,000 --> 02:14:48,000
maybe not maybe not ads but

2745
02:14:48,000 --> 02:14:50,000
like they dropped in a good

2746
02:14:50,000 --> 02:14:52,000
400,000 or something

2747
02:14:52,000 --> 02:14:54,000
like that in the last 30

2748
02:14:54,000 --> 02:14:56,000
45 minutes just kind of cut it off and did it

2749
02:14:56,000 --> 02:14:58,000
and yeah to see the

2750
02:14:58,000 --> 02:15:00,000
production as it was

2751
02:15:00,000 --> 02:15:02,000
ongoing and be able to take that

2752
02:15:02,000 --> 02:15:04,000
and apply it to things

2753
02:15:04,000 --> 02:15:06,000
that I was just watching after the fact

2754
02:15:06,000 --> 02:15:08,000
was a really really fun experience

2755
02:15:08,000 --> 02:15:10,000
I'm so excited

2756
02:15:10,000 --> 02:15:12,000
to have you in studio again at some point

2757
02:15:12,000 --> 02:15:14,000
and hear even more from your experiences

2758
02:15:14,000 --> 02:15:16,000
but I'm going to try to wrap up because

2759
02:15:16,000 --> 02:15:18,000
I do want to make sure we squeeze in a few more calls here with

2760
02:15:18,000 --> 02:15:20,000
our time but best of luck

2761
02:15:20,000 --> 02:15:22,000
to you Jason if you decide to try for the announcer

2762
02:15:22,000 --> 02:15:24,000
thing again I know it's something that Bobby Blockwell

2763
02:15:24,000 --> 02:15:26,000
has talked about pursuing as well

2764
02:15:26,000 --> 02:15:28,000
for me personally I don't know

2765
02:15:28,000 --> 02:15:30,000
I can't fit in another show in my travel

2766
02:15:30,000 --> 02:15:32,000
schedule but you know I support you both

2767
02:15:32,000 --> 02:15:34,000
and I

2768
02:15:34,000 --> 02:15:36,000
fingers and toes crossed

2769
02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:38,000
yeah I don't remember if they

2770
02:15:38,000 --> 02:15:40,000
take volunteers for GDQX but

2771
02:15:40,000 --> 02:15:42,000
obviously I'm going to be keeping my ears open for that

2772
02:15:42,000 --> 02:15:44,000
because I already have my TwitchCon ticket and

2773
02:15:44,000 --> 02:15:46,000
I absolutely

2774
02:15:46,000 --> 02:15:48,000

go ahead and go to another call

2785
02:16:08,000 --> 02:16:10,000
hi you're on Orange Lounge Radio who's this

2786
02:16:10,000 --> 02:16:12,000
hey what's up guys can you hear me it's Kaijuto

2787
02:16:12,000 --> 02:16:14,000
we sure can hey Kaijuto what's on your mind tonight

2788
02:16:14,000 --> 02:16:16,000
how much I just have two things I wanted to bring

2789
02:16:16,000 --> 02:16:18,000
up real quickly

2790
02:16:18,000 --> 02:16:20,000
first the Pokemon remember you guys are talking about

2791
02:16:20,000 --> 02:16:22,000
how certain Pokemon are not going to be in

2792
02:16:22,000 --> 02:16:24,000
what is it Sword and Shield

2793
02:16:24,000 --> 02:16:26,000
oh yes I've heard yes

2794
02:16:26,000 --> 02:16:28,000
yeah well

2795
02:16:28,000 --> 02:16:30,000
I have a theory on that I've noticed something about

2796
02:16:30,000 --> 02:16:32,000
Game Freaks ever since

2797
02:16:32,000 --> 02:16:34,000
the Pokemon games been coming out

2798
02:16:34,000 --> 02:16:36,000
on the 3DS because that's actually when I really started

2799
02:16:36,000 --> 02:16:38,000
getting into the games and like

2800
02:16:38,000 --> 02:16:40,000
collecting the games and all that type of stuff like I got

2801
02:16:40,000 --> 02:16:42,000
black and white in the DS I think

2802
02:16:42,000 --> 02:16:44,000
that was no actually my very first Pokemon game was

2803
02:16:44,000 --> 02:16:46,000
Crystal for the game for

2804
02:16:46,000 --> 02:16:48,000
the Game Boy Color but that was already like late

2805
02:16:48,000 --> 02:16:50,000
in the Game Boy Colors days

2806
02:16:50,000 --> 02:16:52,000
so I really started

2807
02:16:52,000 --> 02:16:54,000
on the DS and 3DS so anyway

2808
02:16:54,000 --> 02:16:56,000
what I noticed was that there's a big

2809
02:16:56,000 --> 02:16:58,000
change that happened in the games between the

2810
02:16:58,000 --> 02:17:00,000
Game Boy Color days and

2811
02:17:00,000 --> 02:17:02,000
the DS going into 3DS and that

2812
02:17:02,000 --> 02:17:04,000
it seems like Game Freaks has been really

2813
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:06,000
beginning they've been getting greedy so I know

2814
02:17:06,000 --> 02:17:08,000
you mentioned a lot about a third game and

2815
02:17:08,000 --> 02:17:10,000
they haven't done a third game in years

2816
02:17:10,000 --> 02:17:12,000
what they usually do is they'll either do a sequel

2817
02:17:12,000 --> 02:17:14,000
to the two games that already

2818
02:17:14,000 --> 02:17:16,000
came out or they'll do like a remake

2819
02:17:16,000 --> 02:17:18,000
of an older game so they actually give you like

2820
02:17:18,000 --> 02:17:20,000
you know they'll start with the two games

2821
02:17:20,000 --> 02:17:22,000
and then like that next year they'll either come

2822
02:17:22,000 --> 02:17:24,000
out with a sequel for those two games or reimagining

2823
02:17:24,000 --> 02:17:26,000
like what they just recently did

2824
02:17:26,000 --> 02:17:28,000
with the past two Pokemon games where they

2825
02:17:28,000 --> 02:17:30,000
basically released the same game but with like new footage

2826
02:17:30,000 --> 02:17:32,000
or something and uh

2827
02:17:32,000 --> 02:17:34,000
I think what's going on with um

2828
02:17:34,000 --> 02:17:36,000
with Sword and Shield is they're

2829
02:17:36,000 --> 02:17:38,000
looking at DLC I think these Pokemon are gonna

2830
02:17:38,000 --> 02:17:40,000
come out in some type of DLC

2831
02:17:40,000 --> 02:17:42,000
or some type of like game update that

2832
02:17:42,000 --> 02:17:44,000
you're gonna have to pay for I think they're

2833
02:17:44,000 --> 02:17:46,000
really trying to uh milk the Pokemon stuff

2834
02:17:46,000 --> 02:17:48,000
perhaps I think I don't

2835
02:17:48,000 --> 02:17:50,000
know I don't know how the fandom would feel about that

2836
02:17:50,000 --> 02:17:52,000
but you know when you're kind of talking about that and then I see

2837
02:17:52,000 --> 02:17:54,000
in chat Act Def says

2838
02:17:54,000 --> 02:17:56,000
Sinnoh remakes incoming you know

2839
02:17:56,000 --> 02:17:58,000
maybe though what what remakes would

2840
02:17:58,000 --> 02:18:00,000
they be on they'd be on gen 4 remakes because they

2841
02:18:00,000 --> 02:18:02,000
remade gen 1, 2, and 3 and then they remade 1

2842
02:18:02,000 --> 02:18:04,000
again but maybe they're they might

2843
02:18:04,000 --> 02:18:06,000
use the engine to do some type of like gen 4

2844
02:18:06,000 --> 02:18:08,000
remake and then that would include at least

2845
02:18:08,000 --> 02:18:10,000
all the Pokemon

2846
02:18:10,000 --> 02:18:12,000
from 4, 3, 2, and 1 in that

2847
02:18:12,000 --> 02:18:14,000
remake you know and that way

2848
02:18:14,000 --> 02:18:16,000
they could kind of sidestep why they haven't included

2849
02:18:16,000 --> 02:18:18,000
things later on and then

2850
02:18:18,000 --> 02:18:20,000
perhaps that kind of also buys them the time

2851
02:18:20,000 --> 02:18:22,000
while there's another you know

2852
02:18:22,000 --> 02:18:24,000
Pokemon in the future I don't know

2853
02:18:24,000 --> 02:18:26,000
are they allowing stuff from Let's Go to go

2854
02:18:26,000 --> 02:18:28,000
into the new game? I don't believe

2855
02:18:28,000 --> 02:18:30,000
so I think that's why you have that Pokemon

2856
02:18:30,000 --> 02:18:32,000
home that's kind of supposed to be a

2857
02:18:32,000 --> 02:18:34,000
kind of catch all for all that stuff

2858
02:18:34,000 --> 02:18:36,000
so is it Pokemon Go into the game then?

2859
02:18:36,000 --> 02:18:38,000
uh as far

2860
02:18:38,000 --> 02:18:40,000
no I don't think your Pokemon from Pokemon Go can go

2861
02:18:40,000 --> 02:18:42,000
you can see catching Pokemon in Pokemon

2862
02:18:42,000 --> 02:18:44,000
Go is easy and

2863
02:18:44,000 --> 02:18:46,000
you're not getting Galar stuff

2864
02:18:46,000 --> 02:18:48,000
yet I mean the newest region Pokemon

2865
02:18:48,000 --> 02:18:50,000
is not in

2866
02:18:50,000 --> 02:18:52,000
say for maybe Meltan

2867
02:18:52,000 --> 02:18:54,000
but I don't know about that

2868
02:18:54,000 --> 02:18:56,000
so yeah but yeah

2869
02:18:56,000 --> 02:18:58,000
I've been really

2870
02:18:58,000 --> 02:19:00,000
ever since X and Y

2871
02:19:00,000 --> 02:19:02,000
when they came out with the

2872
02:19:02,000 --> 02:19:04,000
what was it they did a remake of

2873
02:19:04,000 --> 02:19:06,000
Ruby Sapphire or something

2874
02:19:06,000 --> 02:19:08,000
like that and I got that one in every

2875
02:19:08,000 --> 02:19:10,000
I mean it was a great game but ever since then

2876
02:19:10,000 --> 02:19:12,000
I was like oh no Game Freaks

2877
02:19:12,000 --> 02:19:14,000
they're going in a totally different direction

2878
02:19:14,000 --> 02:19:16,000
they're really going to try to milk this franchise

2879
02:19:16,000 --> 02:19:18,000
and I'm just not liking it now

2880
02:19:18,000 --> 02:19:20,000
like I said this Sword and Moon stuff

2881
02:19:20,000 --> 02:19:22,000
I mean it's really got me thinking that

2882
02:19:22,000 --> 02:19:24,000
they're going to try to mooch as much money off of this thing

2883
02:19:24,000 --> 02:19:26,000
as they can

2884
02:19:26,000 --> 02:19:28,000
I do want to say Act F does clarify in chat

2885
02:19:28,000 --> 02:19:30,000
Pokemon Go Mons can be transferred

2886
02:19:30,000 --> 02:19:32,000
to Sword and Shield through home but it won't

2887
02:19:32,000 --> 02:19:34,000
be every Pokemon I'm so curious

2888
02:19:34,000 --> 02:19:36,000
how that because you know like you have the Pokemon

2889
02:19:36,000 --> 02:19:38,000
based on like one kind of set of stats

2890
02:19:38,000 --> 02:19:40,000
in Go and I wonder how that's going to translate

2891
02:19:40,000 --> 02:19:42,000
I imagine if you transfer it from

2892
02:19:42,000 --> 02:19:44,000
Go you're not going to be able to get the best stat at stuff

2893
02:19:44,000 --> 02:19:46,000
or if they're going to do it from

2894
02:19:46,000 --> 02:19:48,000
if they're going to do it from

2895
02:19:48,000 --> 02:19:50,000
Go they're going to do it like they did with Go Park

2896
02:19:50,000 --> 02:19:52,000
where you have to go catch them again

2897
02:19:54,000 --> 02:19:56,000
that could very well be I got you

2898
02:19:56,000 --> 02:19:58,000
you got to catch them again that makes a lot of sense

2899
02:19:58,000 --> 02:20:00,000
actually

2900
02:20:00,000 --> 02:20:02,000
catch them again I like that that sounds like the title for the next game

2901
02:20:02,000 --> 02:20:04,000
go catch them again dammit

2902
02:20:04,000 --> 02:20:06,000
do it again

2903
02:20:06,000 --> 02:20:08,000
I love it

2904
02:20:08,000 --> 02:20:10,000
at the end of the day

2905
02:20:10,000 --> 02:20:12,000
wait at the end of the day are you picking up

2906
02:20:12,000 --> 02:20:14,000
Sword and Shield?

2907
02:20:14,000 --> 02:20:16,000
oh no I don't even have a switch yet but even if I did

2908
02:20:16,000 --> 02:20:18,000
I think I might

2909
02:20:18,000 --> 02:20:20,000
actually bail out of Pokemon this time around

2910
02:20:20,000 --> 02:20:22,000
and that's a first for me because

2911
02:20:22,000 --> 02:20:24,000
I mean actually I wasn't looking

2912
02:20:24,000 --> 02:20:26,000
forward to the next Pokemon game because that was another thing I wanted to

2913
02:20:26,000 --> 02:20:28,000
bring up was that they used to take about five

2914
02:20:28,000 --> 02:20:30,000
years to bring these things out and now you're just

2915
02:20:30,000 --> 02:20:32,000
getting a Pokemon game every year like Call of Duty

2916
02:20:32,000 --> 02:20:34,000
and every

2917
02:20:34,000 --> 02:20:36,000
year I've been getting more and more sour towards

2918
02:20:36,000 --> 02:20:38,000
the franchise so I doubt even if I

2919
02:20:38,000 --> 02:20:40,000
had a switch I doubt that I'll be

2920
02:20:40,000 --> 02:20:42,000
trying to get the Sword and Moon at least on the first day

2921
02:20:42,000 --> 02:20:44,000
usually I get them on the first day but

2922
02:20:44,000 --> 02:20:46,000
I doubt I would get that game day one I totally

2923
02:20:46,000 --> 02:20:48,000
doubt it even if like I said if I had a

2924
02:20:48,000 --> 02:20:50,000
switch or not

2925
02:20:50,000 --> 02:20:52,000
alright so real

2926
02:20:52,000 --> 02:20:54,000
quickly the Google Stadia I wanted to bring up

2927
02:20:54,000 --> 02:20:56,000
please real quick yeah

2928
02:20:56,000 --> 02:20:58,000
my main issue with

2929
02:20:58,000 --> 02:21:00,000
that is alright so you're

2930
02:21:00,000 --> 02:21:02,000
playing these games off of a cloud

2931
02:21:02,000 --> 02:21:04,000
you don't actually own the game

2932
02:21:04,000 --> 02:21:06,000
you're playing it off a server or whatever

2933
02:21:06,000 --> 02:21:08,000
what happens when somebody like

2934
02:21:08,000 --> 02:21:10,000
me I buy that little niche game that I

2935
02:21:10,000 --> 02:21:12,000
really like but it's not really that popular

2936
02:21:12,000 --> 02:21:14,000
and one day they run out of

2937
02:21:14,000 --> 02:21:16,000
they run out of space for all the

2938
02:21:16,000 --> 02:21:18,000
games that they collect on these servers and then they decide

2939
02:21:18,000 --> 02:21:20,000
oh you know your game isn't that popular enough

2940
02:21:20,000 --> 02:21:22,000
we're gonna remove it from the system

2941
02:21:22,000 --> 02:21:24,000
just to make room for these more popular games

2942
02:21:24,000 --> 02:21:26,000
what happens then?

2943
02:21:26,000 --> 02:21:28,000
considering Google has been very big on

2944
02:21:28,000 --> 02:21:30,000
just let's add more space and the

2945
02:21:30,000 --> 02:21:32,000
the cost of or the

2946
02:21:32,000 --> 02:21:34,000
technology of data gets

2947
02:21:34,000 --> 02:21:36,000
it seems to get like cheaper and cheaper like your Google

2948
02:21:36,000 --> 02:21:38,000
inbox just keeps growing and growing and growing and the

2949
02:21:38,000 --> 02:21:40,000
amount that they let you put in there like

2950
02:21:40,000 --> 02:21:42,000
I've probably actually

2951
02:21:42,000 --> 02:21:44,000
gotten enough mail at this point

2952
02:21:44,000 --> 02:21:46,000
that Google's original threshold for the

2953
02:21:46,000 --> 02:21:48,000
inbox I've probably met but they keep

2954
02:21:48,000 --> 02:21:50,000
expanding it so I don't know if the

2955
02:21:50,000 --> 02:21:52,000
data and the storage

2956
02:21:52,000 --> 02:21:54,000
if that is really going to become a question

2957
02:21:54,000 --> 02:21:56,000
but I don't want to discount your point

2958
02:21:56,000 --> 02:21:58,000
of delisting because

2959
02:21:58,000 --> 02:22:00,000
sometimes it's rights issues

2960
02:22:00,000 --> 02:22:02,000
license issues

2961
02:22:02,000 --> 02:22:04,000
music issues those things

2962
02:22:04,000 --> 02:22:06,000
I think would be a little bit more of a

2963
02:22:06,000 --> 02:22:08,000
I might be concerned about that than I would be

2964
02:22:08,000 --> 02:22:10,000
the

2965
02:22:10,000 --> 02:22:12,000
data side of things so what would happen

2966
02:22:12,000 --> 02:22:14,000
maybe if a licensing right or a music right

2967
02:22:14,000 --> 02:22:16,000
expired would a game get pulled from

2968
02:22:16,000 --> 02:22:18,000
Stadia and then what happens to your money

2969
02:22:18,000 --> 02:22:20,000
at that point now I would assume

2970
02:22:20,000 --> 02:22:22,000
assume that it's

2971
02:22:22,000 --> 02:22:24,000
got to be written into these contracts

2972
02:22:24,000 --> 02:22:26,000
with the game makers is that you can't

2973
02:22:26,000 --> 02:22:28,000
do that like if you put your game on this

2974
02:22:28,000 --> 02:22:30,000
platform you are not going to be able to pull it

2975
02:22:30,000 --> 02:22:32,000
for any reason for at least

2976
02:22:32,000 --> 02:22:34,000
maybe that like new copies

2977
02:22:34,000 --> 02:22:36,000
can stop being sold and maybe that's how they get

2978
02:22:36,000 --> 02:22:38,000
around the license thing but you will not be

2979
02:22:38,000 --> 02:22:40,000
able to ever pull this game completely

2980
02:22:40,000 --> 02:22:42,000
from the service and if they didn't put that

2981
02:22:42,000 --> 02:22:44,000
in the contracts they are

2982
02:22:44,000 --> 02:22:46,000
yikes

2983
02:22:46,000 --> 02:22:48,000
well good thing you bring that up

2984
02:22:48,000 --> 02:22:50,000
I just want to bring up one other thing I know that you guys

2985
02:22:50,000 --> 02:22:52,000
got to get home and everything but at

2986
02:22:52,000 --> 02:22:54,000
least Loki has to get home you're already home so

2987
02:22:54,000 --> 02:22:56,000
but anyway

2988
02:22:56,000 --> 02:22:58,000
what I noticed Google Play

2989
02:22:58,000 --> 02:23:00,000
they're also a part of Google right

2990
02:23:00,000 --> 02:23:02,000
like you know like they

2991
02:23:02,000 --> 02:23:04,000
they're technically Google right

2992
02:23:04,000 --> 02:23:06,000
Google Play on the alright so what I've

2993
02:23:06,000 --> 02:23:08,000
noticed is that there's been plenty of games that I

2994
02:23:08,000 --> 02:23:10,000
bought off of the Google Play Store

2995
02:23:10,000 --> 02:23:12,000
and then one day I

2996
02:23:12,000 --> 02:23:14,000
log in and my games are gone

2997
02:23:14,000 --> 02:23:16,000
I don't get I don't get

2998
02:23:16,000 --> 02:23:18,000
refunded half the time

2999
02:23:18,000 --> 02:23:20,000
they're just gone so like I wonder

3000
02:23:20,000 --> 02:23:22,000
you know you talk about their space and all that stuff

3001
02:23:22,000 --> 02:23:24,000
and like they're just pulling stuff on the

3002
02:23:24,000 --> 02:23:26,000
Android store they also do it on

3003
02:23:26,000 --> 02:23:28,000
the Amazon too I have the Amazon Kindle

3004
02:23:28,000 --> 02:23:30,000
and they remove a lot of games there too and that's

3005
02:23:30,000 --> 02:23:32,000
mostly because

3006
02:23:32,000 --> 02:23:34,000
developers are just taking them off

3007
02:23:34,000 --> 02:23:36,000
for whatever reason or they're not getting updated

3008
02:23:36,000 --> 02:23:38,000
I think these are questions that Google

3009
02:23:38,000 --> 02:23:40,000
is going to have to take years to prove the answers

3010
02:23:40,000 --> 02:23:42,000
to as we kind of referenced earlier and

3011
02:23:42,000 --> 02:23:44,000
I don't know I don't know if Google's

3012
02:23:44,000 --> 02:23:46,000
going to do it their track record doesn't make me

3013
02:23:46,000 --> 02:23:48,000
very hopeful but we'll see we'll

3014
02:23:48,000 --> 02:23:50,000
see what they're willing to say in the coming months

3015
02:23:50,000 --> 02:23:52,000
especially as you know

3016
02:23:52,000 --> 02:23:54,000
the it's about to release and the pro version

3017
02:23:54,000 --> 02:23:56,000

3018
02:23:56,000 --> 02:23:58,000
who's using it end up coming out so we'll

3019
02:23:58,000 --> 02:24:00,000
see we'll keep an eye on it well

3020
02:24:00,000 --> 02:24:02,000

want to hit your mute button if you can hear me

3032

let's throw that on the pile

3049
02:25:00,000 --> 02:25:02,000

the backlog where you just purchase games that you

3051
02:25:04,000 --> 02:25:06,000
never intend to play

3052
02:25:06,000 --> 02:25:08,000

02:25:16,000 --> 02:25:18,000
OLR tonight you know I was

3058
02:25:18,000 --> 02:25:20,000
looking for some stuff

3059
02:25:20,000 --> 02:25:22,000
I didn't really see

3060
02:25:22,000 --> 02:25:24,000
I saw something in like my Google

3061
02:25:24,000 --> 02:25:26,000
news feed earlier about

3062
02:25:26,000 --> 02:25:28,000
I

3063
02:25:28,000 --> 02:25:30,000
had to find the story now because

3064
02:25:30,000 --> 02:25:32,000
it was on my phone but it was something to do

3065
02:25:32,000 --> 02:25:34,000
with we are going to close up

3066
02:25:34,000 --> 02:25:36,000
Discord for the night by the way so sorry if you

3067
02:25:36,000 --> 02:25:38,000
didn't get through but please consider leaving a

3068
02:25:38,000 --> 02:25:40,000
question in the chat or of course you can always send us an email

3069
02:25:40,000 --> 02:25:42,000
to participate at

3070
02:25:42,000 --> 02:25:44,000
OrangeLoungeRadio.com it was about

3071
02:25:44,000 --> 02:25:46,000
VR and it was Walmart using

3072
02:25:46,000 --> 02:25:48,000
it to pick middle managers using

3073
02:25:48,000 --> 02:25:50,000
VR

3074
02:25:50,000 --> 02:25:52,000
they were using VR training

3075
02:25:52,000 --> 02:25:54,000
I don't know what

3076
02:25:54,000 --> 02:25:56,000
necessarily they were doing with that but

3077
02:25:56,000 --> 02:25:58,000
that reminds me of like that

3078
02:25:58,000 --> 02:26:00,000
one I don't know if anyone's seen the game

3079
02:26:00,000 --> 02:26:02,000
play video of the KFC

3080
02:26:02,000 --> 02:26:04,000
VR game which I totally want to play at

3081
02:26:04,000 --> 02:26:06,000
some point I don't know how to get to

3082
02:26:06,000 --> 02:26:08,000
it but apparently it's like some VR game

3083
02:26:08,000 --> 02:26:10,000
that they have for KFC it's fucking weird

3084
02:26:10,000 --> 02:26:12,000
it's like Burger King

3085
02:26:12,000 --> 02:26:14,000
games I feel like that came up on the show

3086
02:26:14,000 --> 02:26:16,000
not that long ago it was the KFC training

3087
02:26:16,000 --> 02:26:18,000
we talked about that on the show a few weeks ago it was a while ago

3088
02:26:18,000 --> 02:26:20,000
but yeah it's interesting

3089
02:26:20,000 --> 02:26:22,000
it's about time Burger King or

3090
02:26:22,000 --> 02:26:24,000
KFC or McDonald's I don't give

3091
02:26:24,000 --> 02:26:26,000
a shit who makes a fucking weird ass game

3092
02:26:26,000 --> 02:26:28,000
but it's about time that we had some weird

3093
02:26:28,000 --> 02:26:30,000
ass games based on food franchises

3094
02:26:30,000 --> 02:26:32,000
and I'll be honest it's the

3095
02:26:32,000 --> 02:26:34,000
time for VR we need fucking weird

3096
02:26:34,000 --> 02:26:36,000
ass creepy shit

3097
02:26:36,000 --> 02:26:38,000
food franchise

3098
02:26:38,000 --> 02:26:40,000
VR games I just hope I want them now

3099
02:26:40,000 --> 02:26:42,000
I just hope the VR training games are teaching them

3100
02:26:42,000 --> 02:26:44,000
to double check the order before they

3101
02:26:44,000 --> 02:26:46,000
pass it to the customer no I want it fucking creepy

3102
02:26:46,000 --> 02:26:48,000
as shit I want it sneak king shit

3103
02:26:48,000 --> 02:26:50,000
that this is what I'm looking for

3104
02:26:52,000 --> 02:26:54,000
I miss those Burger King games from the icebox

3105
02:26:54,000 --> 02:26:56,000
they're so so interesting

3106
02:26:56,000 --> 02:26:58,000
so I think back where there is with it

3107
02:26:58,000 --> 02:27:00,000
is that backwards compatible yet Emma can I get that

3108
02:27:00,000 --> 02:27:02,000
as part of my games with gold

3109
02:27:02,000 --> 02:27:04,000
that would be worth it right there

3110
02:27:04,000 --> 02:27:06,000
come on Burger King make it happen

3111
02:27:06,000 --> 02:27:08,000
oh boy alright anything else for last

3112
02:27:08,000 --> 02:27:10,000
