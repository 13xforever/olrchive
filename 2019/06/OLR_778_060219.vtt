This week we've learned that Uno is the most popular Overwatch workshop mode. What better way to cool down from a hectic battle than by skip, drop, forward, reverse and Uno dominating your opponents. This is just one card in hand. Stay tuned for the rest of the week's gaming news starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:28.000 --> 00:31.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:32.000 --> 00:47.000
Hello my friends out there on the internet. Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio Live tonight with episode number 778 for this June the 2nd of 2019. We are back after a week off.

00:48.000 --> 01:00.000
Celebrating what's going on in video games, gaming culture and the gamer lifestyle here in studio live at twitch.tv slash vog network myself Rob Roberts and joining me as always DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

01:01.000 --> 01:07.000
Sup bitches. Hi how are you welcome back. I'm feeling sassy Rob. Yeah are you relaxed and refreshed after a vacation?

01:08.000 --> 01:24.000
Alright let me come back to you in a minute because I also have to introduce. Just two words. Sure. Con crud. Yes we'll talk about that too. Joining us of course you can see over there at twitch.tv you can see to my right but left on tv because everything is backwards. Techmaster Loki.

01:25.000 --> 01:35.000
We're in the mirrorverse. We are in the mirrorverse. How are you doing? I'm fine. You did not have a vacation last week. No I ended up working all weekend for the most part.

01:35.000 --> 01:47.000
I saw you were streaming during OLR's time. You were doing some DVR. Yeah I was just streaming because I didn't get twitch affiliate or something like that but I haven't quite gotten there yet because I need to stream more days.

01:48.000 --> 01:58.000
And I just didn't feel like it this week because the garage is hot again. Summer is coming. So I have been streaming on and off but I'll try to do a little bit more.

01:59.000 --> 02:19.000
Well now she mentioned the downside to traveling is con crud and I know I picked up sick. She picked up sick. How are you feeling? I'm fine but the scare I have right now is that like last week or something like that we got a message that someone at the school has chicken pox.

02:20.000 --> 02:33.000
Oh yeah I saw your tweet about this. I haven't had chicken pox and I'm not with your cool kids that are young and hip and everything like that and have gotten their shots so they don't get chicken pox. I'm just rolling the dice.

02:34.000 --> 02:44.000
Wait have you not been vaccinated? I am an anti-vax chicken poxer. Can't you fix that? I could but I hate shots and I'm too lazy to go down there. You really should think about it.

02:44.000 --> 02:52.000
Yeah I should. Keep in mind you could get shingles instead. I understand that my sister has had chicken pox three times and I've never caught it so meh.

02:53.000 --> 03:07.000
I wouldn't roll the dice. Just suck it up and do it. Fine. Here's the thing. I used to hate shots too and then remember that year that I was really sick. I had the pancreatitis, gallbladder, all that stuff. I had my blood drawn like 500 times so I got used to it. You just have to look the other way.

03:07.000 --> 03:16.000
No I get it. And just not think about it. I get it. And a good phlebotomist. Is that what they're called? A good phlebotomist will talk to you about something else and distract you and not even telling you when they're doing it.

03:17.000 --> 03:22.000
Yeah. Fine. You can do it. Don't be a baby. It's fine.

03:23.000 --> 03:27.000
Just breathe. Whatever. Breathe in and then exhale when the needle goes in.

03:28.000 --> 03:39.000
Over in our chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network because we do tape live at the voice geeks network twitch.tv slash vog network every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific nine o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Black Wolf show except last week.

03:40.000 --> 03:51.000
So I hope you all had a good I hope you had a good three day weekend and Memorial Day was good for you guys. And looking in chat S.J. 100 Matt says I think CVS does them cheap also.

03:52.000 --> 04:03.000
Yeah it's I can go and get it done for free at the lab. I mean I'm active simply says don't be that guy. I won't be that guy. I will do it. It's just good boy. Here's a cookie.

04:04.000 --> 04:11.000
Maybe the kids can give you a tip to answer S.J. 100 Matt's question will the DDR overheat in the summer in the garage.

04:11.000 --> 04:29.000
No I don't think so. I don't think it gets I mean it does get really hot out there but it was fine last summer. So I'd assume that it's fine still. But you know then again my other arcade cabinet broke in the garage so I don't know.

04:30.000 --> 04:38.000
It should be fine though. And it doesn't matter if it breaks then I'm just put a new thing in there anyways a PC to put step mania on there so it's all good.

04:38.000 --> 04:52.000
Let's talk a little bit about our our weeks away. It is a video game show and I know you didn't do a lot about video games and I only partially did so we'll just quickly recap our weekend off Dark Sakura. How was your trip.

04:53.000 --> 05:01.000
Oh God. OK. So we got E3 hype coming up but I know some people want to know the personal stuff so let's indulge quickly.

05:01.000 --> 05:16.000
All right. So I got in my car and zoomed on down ninety nine quickly. Yes. OK. So I went to drag con and I went there as a sister and there were sister panels and we cut.

05:16.000 --> 05:28.000
Well the people on the panel got talent badges. So guess who took a talent badge to the green room the last day of the convention. That would be me. I got to meet Nina West.

05:29.000 --> 05:41.000
Nice. I got to meet the Belay brothers. I these are all famous drag queens people that don't know. And I got to meet Loki. Now you may laugh at this because I met Tempest Dujour in line to get a mimosa.

05:41.000 --> 05:51.000
Who was wearing a plastic necklace that said fuck Trixie. Because she's like Oh I like your necklace. What does it say. Mine says Chava because that's my sister name Chava Kiki. Yeah.

05:52.000 --> 06:02.000
And she's like Oh do you like mine. It said fuck Trixie. I was like they're friends though so yeah. They took pictures together. And you know Gia had like the most beautiful set but I don't think I took a picture of it.

06:03.000 --> 06:07.000
But anyway I had a great time. I met so many people. I met Ginger Minj. I met Raja finally.

06:07.000 --> 06:14.000
Did you plug VOG Network with all them queens them gamer queens. Yes I did mention to the gamer queens. Good. Good job.

06:15.000 --> 06:25.000
But I had a great time. And then on Monday I went to San Diego to visit some other sisters who are friends of mine and they took me up Highway 1 at the coast up into Carlsbad and everything. It was pretty beautiful.

06:26.000 --> 06:33.000
And I went to Extraordinary Desserts which is like my favorite dessert place in the universe. And then Tuesday I did Solo Disney.

06:33.000 --> 06:39.000
Solo Disney. We were talking about this a little bit before because I was kind of like oh I wonder if Disneyland would actually be fun by yourself.

06:40.000 --> 06:49.000
But then when you kind of started to make your case I was like yeah you know what actually when you get to do things at your own pace and you're you're not worried about anybody else's agenda and you just kind of get to do your own thing I bet it would be a lot of fun.

06:50.000 --> 06:58.000
And you know what it was fucking fun. Single writer lines. Yeah. And you just missed the Star Wars thing though right. I didn't care about Star Wars shit. Yeah.

06:58.000 --> 07:07.000
I'll go to that shit later. Later after after this stereotypes down. Exactly. So I mean like I finally did in credit coaster. I did the cars right as many times as I want to.

07:08.000 --> 07:16.000
I did single writer on everything I could get away doing single writer on. You know when my neck got stiff I went on Indiana Jones to have it pop my neck like you do.

07:16.000 --> 07:26.000
I did Haunted Mansion. I did I even did the Roger Rabbit thing. So I mean I went into to town. I actually found two quiet spots in the park.

07:27.000 --> 07:40.000
One of them is this little restaurant is called like the Harbor Cafe or something. And it's right across from Haunted Mansion and it's actually really quiet. You can find seating there and it overlooks a bit of the lagoon there and no one will bother you.

07:40.000 --> 07:54.000
It's quiet and lobster rolls and then another little places in to town right when you go in through the gates and then off to the left there's like this little circular seating area and really no one loud goes there.

07:55.000 --> 08:08.000
I think it's like oh my God my kids are fucking driving me nuts place you know. And then the other fun thing is I got my picture taken with their Captain Marvel who she's a little too skinny to be a good Captain Marvel but she was very good adequate.

08:08.000 --> 08:17.000
Yes I was wearing my Captain Marvel skater dress. So she asked me what powers I had and I was like I'm binary era and she just grinned. So apparently she got it.

08:18.000 --> 08:25.000
She's probably heard it all too. Yeah but you know and then I got a kid from it. I got a hug from a two year old.

08:25.000 --> 08:29.000
Wait you took a kid at Disneyland. How much does a kid cost Disneyland.

08:30.000 --> 08:37.000
I got jelly beans to keep my blood sugar up because you can actually there's like a jelly belly selection thing over at the Winnie the Pooh thing.

08:38.000 --> 08:49.000
So I got that trucked back over to California adventure. My feet were kind of dead by the end of the day but there's these two little kids in line and their mama was from Alabama originally and moved to Nevada.

08:49.000 --> 08:55.000
So we were just chatting in line and I was giving her kids jelly beans because it was keeping them from climbing all over the poles and everything.

08:56.000 --> 08:57.000
That's very nice of you to give other people's kids sugar.

08:58.000 --> 09:08.000
Well she was fine with it I asked. But anyway the little boys like will you ride with us. And I'm like well I'll be behind you. I forgot the monster's ink thing is three cars deep.

09:08.000 --> 09:16.000
So I ended up in their car anyway I was like OK. Looks like I'm riding with y'all. And we got to the end and the little boys OK come with us now.

09:17.000 --> 09:26.000
They're like no I'm going to go over to where the champagne is and get adult beverages and Auntie Jamie's got a date with mimosas.

09:27.000 --> 09:34.000
Oh no they have this like lavender lemonade champagne thing that it's expensive because it's fucking Disney but it was good.

09:34.000 --> 09:48.000
I also found out my Starbucks Starbucks app works at Disneyland. Yeah. So anyway but the little girl turns around and looks up at me with these big cute little eyes and those her arms around my legs and I'm like my heart's gonna break.

09:49.000 --> 10:00.000
I normally don't like children but this is the most adorable thing in the universe. And so I got down on my knees and I gave her a big hug after getting the OK from her mama because I don't hug other people's kids without consent.

10:00.000 --> 10:15.000
And her mom's like that is the cutest thing I've ever seen her do. And she's normally pretty shy. So so little little Zoe and little Luke you are the cutest kids at Disneyland and you win all the Disney's ever.

10:16.000 --> 10:28.000
That's a nice story. Yeah. So that that made my day. And then I ran into our friend Bobby who gave me a drive home from not Bobby but no not Bobby Black Lady Bobby Lady Bobby. Yeah.

10:29.000 --> 10:40.000
Who gave me a ride so I didn't have to order a lift. OK. And took me by CVS so I could get something for the dang blister between my toes. Oh no no. I've got a gnarly blister between my toes.

10:40.000 --> 10:59.000
So that was what I did quickly my week. I went to Chicago. One last thing. Bravo Cheese Farm. OK. I went to Chicago. I go about once a year to see my friends out there. I'm pretty tight with some former podcasters and current podcasters that live out there and you know I go out there about once a year just hang out and had a good time.

11:00.000 --> 11:12.000
It timed it this year up with the big Ingress event that was the weekend and it was there was a lot going on because I did a thing Friday night that this thing called Intel Ops which was like it was supposed to be like an escape room but like out in the city.

11:13.000 --> 11:23.000
So it started off kind of neat like all spy games like we got texted a message that said meet this person at this diner at this location. It had a little thing and it said say this phrase to him and I'll say it back to you or whatever.

11:24.000 --> 11:31.000
So we went over there and then the guy gave us a suitcase with a phone in it and then we got another text message that said use this phone to go hack this portal. We're like OK.

11:32.000 --> 11:38.000
And then we got another text message. Now go use the phone to hack this portal. OK. Now go hack this portal. OK. Go hack this portal.

11:39.000 --> 11:52.000
So unfortunately it started off strong but then it just kind of turned into wild goose chase like I felt like I guess they. Meanwhile we heard other groups were like raiding hotel rooms and others so I don't know I think I think they still have some things to work out about making it interesting for everybody.

11:53.000 --> 12:01.000
So it started off really interesting. And then Saturday was the big anomaly event and we lost by four points.

12:02.000 --> 12:22.000
And it's it's going to be a very interesting kind of controversial thing because the play box was a solid green my team and the blue team ended up winning because and I'm not going to complain about the rules I'm not gonna be a bitter Betty because they there was different games going on some of them were a little more invisible like the media game and the hacking the portals game and their strategy was to really push those games as much as they could.

12:23.000 --> 12:33.000
And they were successful in what they did. But I think it is going to kind of cause a discussion about is that kind of what you want the ingress anomaly to be so to be interesting to see like moving forward kind of what that does.

12:34.000 --> 12:46.000
But I'm not you know. Hey they read the rules they had a good strategy. Kudos to them. I'm not going to not go be a bit better about it because I think I actually made an Instagram post it was something like I should be bitter we lost that anomaly but I feel fucking good today.

12:46.000 --> 12:55.000
Like I'm like I'm on vacation. The air is nice today. I'm with my friends. I don't give a shit that we lost. It's just a game whatever.

12:56.000 --> 13:12.000
So yeah that was that was that and then Sunday they do this thing called mission day so I make it sound like I did nothing but play the game and I did do that a lot but I was able to mix in other things in there so like Alan and I went out and had a nice dinner at Benihana which is why I wasn't on Bobby show last week with a call.

13:12.000 --> 13:21.000
We you know got to go out to some clubs and things of that sort so I had a good time. I had a good trip to Chicago. Not a lot of gaming outside of the ingress stuff. I didn't even play Pokemon Go.

13:22.000 --> 13:32.000
Like there was like the shiny lappers thing happened. I was so fixated on what we were doing for ingress and honestly I haven't touched Pokemon Go in days which for me is a lot.

13:32.000 --> 13:41.000
I usually check it once a day. I let my streak go. I feel like I'm level 40. I've caught everything that's reasonable.

13:42.000 --> 13:51.000
The amount of experience you get for the streak is like very minimal anyways and like item wise you know with gifts and everything it's like oh no I'm missing out on the item bonus.

13:51.000 --> 13:59.000
That reminds me I need to send gifts to people and I did go kind of nuts on Pokemon at Disneyland and I did a little bit of ingress but most of Disneyland was green.

14:00.000 --> 14:03.000
So I take that back. Most of Disneyland was blue.

14:04.000 --> 14:05.000
Oh then you needed the bursters.

14:06.000 --> 14:10.000
Wait. No no it was green. Sorry. I'm trying to remember the right color because it's the one that Shane doesn't like.

14:11.000 --> 14:18.000
Anyway. So yeah that was essentially my trip in a nutshell. I'll talk a little more about some of the specific games I played during my gaming week.

14:19.000 --> 14:25.000
We didn't end up going to the barcade or anything like that this time. It was pretty much ingress was the only game I was playing over those few days.

14:26.000 --> 14:31.000
But I played some Switch stuff on the plane and I played some other games throughout the week so I had a good week off.

14:32.000 --> 14:35.000
Except the whole getting sick part like leaving Chicago fucking sucked.

14:35.000 --> 14:43.000
So I mean everything was beautiful during the time we were there but the day we left so we left on Monday Memorial Day and I don't know if you guys heard on the news or whatever.

14:44.000 --> 14:48.000
But like Midway Airport like shut down for like two hours like no flights are coming in or anything like that.

14:49.000 --> 14:58.000
So our flight got hosed. We were delayed going back. We didn't get back to Oakland California until midnight Pacific time which is 2 a.m. central time at that point.

14:59.000 --> 15:02.000
And so I think I didn't get home and crawl into my bed until two thirty Pacific.

15:03.000 --> 15:04.000
Wow. And then I had to work the next day.

15:05.000 --> 15:13.000
Well I was pretty crappy. Yeah I was pretty crappy. But that's that's the risk you take when you book a late flight is that there might especially out of Chicago where there might be you know huge thunderstorms.

15:14.000 --> 15:20.000
But it worked out. So anyway let's get into video games. So it is a video game show. We had to get some of the personal stuff out of the way.

15:21.000 --> 15:25.000
Let's talk about a lot of hype going on. Not I mean we have some news to talk about tonight.

15:26.000 --> 15:31.000
Not as many leaks as I would thought by now. That's very true. But we still have the whole week.

15:31.000 --> 15:38.000
It's quiet right now relatively. I mean I've seen some gaming week news that get pretty busy this week was relatively quiet even past two weeks.

15:39.000 --> 15:43.000
I mean if we had done a show last week there wouldn't have been a lot to talk about. There's a few things not not a lot.

15:44.000 --> 15:57.000
So you know now that we're back this week we have enough to fill out a show tonight but it's relatively light all things considered because E3 a week from today will be underway by the time our next episode is underway.

15:57.000 --> 16:07.000
Microsoft will have said this is our plan for the holiday season with their press conference. So we know some things about where Microsoft's going right Loki.

16:08.000 --> 16:23.000
Yes so they are going to have about 14 games to show off during E3. So you may remember last year they talked about all these different company acquisitions that they did bringing them under the Microsoft Game Studios platform.

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
And now we're going to see the fruit of that labor.

16:27.000 --> 16:31.000
I'm kind of surprised it's this soon. I would have still given it two or three years.

16:32.000 --> 16:39.000
Not everything necessarily is going to be coming out this year. I assume they could announce stuff that's going to be coming out could have already been in development when they had 2019.

16:40.000 --> 16:52.000
I would say maybe early 2020 you could even see maybe some like later announcements like we still have you know like Halo Infinite that they teased like just so briefly last year and now we'll probably see more of that.

16:52.000 --> 17:03.000
Battletoads was a big battle. Yes. So that'll be awesome. So there's lots of stuff and it's about time because they really need like games on that platform.

17:04.000 --> 17:14.000
They need a reason why I want to buy an Xbox. Although nowadays with everything coming on PC I don't really need to buy an Xbox because my PC is an Xbox in that sense.

17:14.000 --> 17:21.000
So whatever. Win win. Well speaking of hardware do we think we kind of know where Microsoft might end up with that.

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
I don't know. Are we going to see the announcement of the next platform.

17:25.000 --> 17:34.000
That's kind of where my head is at because I mean could we see because we got a teaser last year. Remember right. They did sort of drop that what Project Scorpion or whatever they're calling it.

17:35.000 --> 17:40.000
They dropped that little teaser right at the end. So you kind of wonder like are we. But wasn't Scorpio the Xbox One X.

17:41.000 --> 17:47.000
Oh maybe maybe I can't even remember. I thought we got a little teaser right at the end that was indicating something else.

17:48.000 --> 17:58.000
Well I think that they're like saying yeah we're working on another console but I don't know. It would be neat to see if that's what we're going to see or that's going to be part of the announcement is some of these games going to be on the next console.

17:59.000 --> 18:07.000
Well the other interesting thing. Remember Microsoft has already said that they anticipate their future games will run on Xbox One.

18:07.000 --> 18:19.000
They're trying to get a little more platform agnostic I suppose is that yes there will be another console that will run the games better, faster, smoother, more graphics and all that.

18:20.000 --> 18:24.000
But that these games will work on Xbox One. It's going to be similar to a PC.

18:24.000 --> 18:33.000
Yeah like well a PC or if you play a game on an iPhone 6 it'll work but it might be a little bit stuttery. You know it might be might have some frame rate problems.

18:34.000 --> 18:40.000
But if you play it on an iPhone 10 or you know the newer ones whatever the 10 are whatever it's going to be very smooth very you know very high def.

18:41.000 --> 18:48.000
I would be curious to see like with these new consoles what they're going to be pushing how they're going to be pushing these consoles because really fidelity right now.

18:48.000 --> 18:57.000
It's I mean granted like I say Xbox One like hardware and even the PlayStation 4 like that stuff is relatively old by today's standards.

18:58.000 --> 19:04.000
But like fidelity wise it's just like I don't know how much better we can really get.

19:05.000 --> 19:11.000
Again graphics aren't everything. You could make the game look immensely pretty but it doesn't mean it's going to be a better game.

19:11.000 --> 19:21.000
So I'd be curious to see what they're going to leverage to try to make people more interested in those platforms you know like modding user generated stuff that would be kind of cool.

19:22.000 --> 19:27.000
I know definitely Microsoft's been more open about that versus Sony which definitely that weighs in a lot if I'm going to be purchasing another system.

19:28.000 --> 19:29.000
For you. For me yeah.

19:30.000 --> 19:36.000
Act Deft in chat says at Twitch TV slash VOG Network the next gen Xbox is called Scarlet. That was the name of it.

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
So and I could swear we got a little teaser at the end.

19:40.000 --> 19:44.000
Why we are in chat is asking but is fidelity good at 4K and how's the frame rate.

19:45.000 --> 19:48.000
I mean I don't know.

19:49.000 --> 19:58.000
That's Microsoft answer right. Yeah that's that's really I mean 4K looks nice but like it's not everything that's out there is running at native 4K anyways.

19:59.000 --> 20:06.000
I actually think it's very interesting and I'm so curious what the future for Microsoft like three years from now is going to look like.

20:07.000 --> 20:14.000
Because I do think it's very interesting that they are taking and you know now that we're hearing that the focus of E3 sounds like it's going to be games games games.

20:14.000 --> 20:21.000
I think it's very interesting that they are taking the focus off a console like maybe Microsoft will announce a console.

20:22.000 --> 20:29.000
But maybe that's not where they want the focus like they want you to be focusing on these games and the fact that the games you can buy on your Xbox One.

20:30.000 --> 20:37.000
You can buy their little subscription service and play the games there or you can play on PC because we know Microsoft kind of wants to be more a platform.

20:37.000 --> 20:46.000
So maybe Microsoft is starting to kind of dial back how much stock they're putting in their hardware so to speak and really focus.

20:47.000 --> 20:54.000
And it's a very interesting sort of contrast to the expectation I think out of Sony right now not just like something that Sony is putting on themselves.

20:55.000 --> 20:59.000
But if you read about the media you always hear about PlayStation 5 what Sony doing for PlayStation 5.

20:59.000 --> 21:03.000
Oh they're taking this year off of E3 because they're working on PlayStation 5.

21:04.000 --> 21:12.000
And I feel like the conversation when it comes to Sony is very much about this incremental step up where I feel like Microsoft is not setting that same expectation.

21:13.000 --> 21:14.000
It's very interesting to me.

21:14.000 --> 21:20.000
Yeah aside from Microsoft too that's not the only company that's going to be having lots of announcements.

21:21.000 --> 21:33.000
So for example there was a leak from GameStop employees saying that there's like 21 placeholder SKUs for Switch games as well.

21:34.000 --> 21:38.000
So we're going to be seeing I'm sure lots of Switch game announcements coming out of E3 as well.

21:39.000 --> 21:40.000
I'm not super surprised to hear that.

21:40.000 --> 21:45.000
The Switch has been doing really well. Nintendo is not in the same position with the Switch as they were with the Wii U.

21:46.000 --> 21:49.000
They have third party support so I anticipate we're not just going to have first part.

21:50.000 --> 21:54.000
We know we're getting Animal Crossing. We know Metroid something's probably happening.

21:55.000 --> 21:56.000
Probably not Metroid Prime 4 because they're rebooting that right.

21:57.000 --> 22:02.000
But maybe like Metroid Collection and there's probably something we don't know about yet that they will unveil.

22:03.000 --> 22:06.000
There will probably be another type of who knows something.

22:07.000 --> 22:08.000
But then there's probably going to be a bunch of third party stuff.

22:08.000 --> 22:12.000
Sega has been a very big supporter of Nintendo. Maybe a Sonic something something.

22:13.000 --> 22:22.000
We've got Square might continue their relationship and put something who knows like another remaster or something on the Switch.

22:23.000 --> 22:24.000
And you know Bandai Namco I'm sure is going to do something.

22:25.000 --> 22:26.000
So I feel like there's going to be a lot of third party support.

22:27.000 --> 22:31.000
Oh Bayonetta 3. Hello. That's probably a big thing for the Switch this year.

22:31.000 --> 22:36.000
So 21 games when you kind of put first and third party together through the holiday.

22:37.000 --> 22:42.000
That's actually like I know it sounds like a lot and it is but it's kind of like that's that's what I would that's what I would kind of hope for.

22:43.000 --> 22:45.000
Yeah. Yeah. So. All right. Be interesting.

22:46.000 --> 22:49.000
Going to chat for some more comments over at Twitch TV slash VOG Network.

22:50.000 --> 22:56.000
Bobby Blackwell says one of the things I like about the PlayStation 5 is the idea of the faster load times because of the solid state drive.

22:56.000 --> 23:01.000
So if Xbox can copy that idea and also decrease load times that'd be awesome.

23:02.000 --> 23:06.000
Agreed. Yeah. Yeah. I think a very logical step certainly for the system.

23:07.000 --> 23:12.000
YYR saying that's why there's new consoles coming. Also ray tracing will be a thing.

23:13.000 --> 23:19.000
Kaijuto asking how does 4K enhance my gameplay. I'm more into innovating gameplay not the new shiny.

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
I think it's kind of a different strokes for different folks argument.

23:22.000 --> 23:29.000
I mean like when I play a Final Fantasy game historically you know Final Fantasy is that series I've always thought of as like really cutting edge with graphics right.

23:30.000 --> 23:36.000
And I do get really excited when I see like oh this game looks gorgeous and I think graphics can really like grab your attention.

23:37.000 --> 23:44.000
It is a fine balance. You can't just push like good graphics. You also have to have the gameplay because really it can it can look like anything in the gameplay is not there.

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
And if the gameplay is not there it's not going to matter.

23:47.000 --> 23:53.000
And we all know in 2019 graphics don't always you know you don't have to have cutting edge 4K graphics to have a wonderful game.

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
I mean retro style games hello are all the rage right.

23:57.000 --> 23:59.000
Whether they have that game that just came out I think this week Gato Roboto.

24:00.000 --> 24:06.000
Yeah. Which is like you know looks like a Game Boy black and white type game you know it's like an Metroidvania with a cat.

24:07.000 --> 24:08.000
Space cat.

24:09.000 --> 24:12.000
Minecraft continues to be a powerhouse. A lot of these roguelikes are retro inspired.

24:12.000 --> 24:16.000
Minecraft 2. We're getting Minecraft 2 this year. It's part of you know 14 games maybe.

24:17.000 --> 24:18.000
You know I.

24:19.000 --> 24:28.000
Speaking of high fidelity Microsoft when are we getting that 4K texture pack. Is it that the next gen Xbox is the only thing that could really push those 4K graphics.

24:29.000 --> 24:32.000
There's just certain things I've said year after year and this is the year I'm just going to stop.

24:33.000 --> 24:39.000
So when it comes to Minecraft 2 I'm just I'm not putting that out there this year because I've been let down every other time maybe if I don't say it this year it'll happen.

24:39.000 --> 24:44.000
But I agree the 4K pack is something that probably needs to happen first.

24:45.000 --> 24:51.000
Renji221 with a pretty good guess. My guess is we're getting the second smash DLC character during the direct as well.

24:52.000 --> 24:57.000
Let's talk about predictions for a minute. You know in years past we've done a fun little like list list segment.

24:58.000 --> 25:02.000
I don't know if we really I mean E3 is just kind of a different show now than it was several years ago.

25:03.000 --> 25:06.000
We already know like yeah he's not going to be there. We already know certain things are going to be happening.

25:06.000 --> 25:13.000
So but what do you what do you think might be some E3 predictions that we just we don't know yet.

25:14.000 --> 25:22.000
I would think let's see I'd be curious to see what Sony is going to announce. I know they don't really have a presence at E3.

25:23.000 --> 25:30.000
They're doing their own thing but you know they're going to do like probably whatever their direct thing is around the same time.

25:30.000 --> 25:38.000
I'd be curious to see what they have to announce. I'm from Nintendo. I can see another Labo announcement for them.

25:39.000 --> 25:43.000
I'm not going to buy it though because I already have enough cardboard crap laying around my house.

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
Although we did use it this week so there's that.

25:47.000 --> 25:54.000
Microsoft I really don't know because they've got just so many I think we're going to see a lot of new IPs from Microsoft which is good.

25:55.000 --> 26:03.000
Probably Forza Horizon or Forza 5. I would imagine. I mean it just seems like it's not Horizon. This is no.

26:04.000 --> 26:10.000
No it'd be Forza. Yeah maybe some Mortar Sport I think it'd be up to eight now. Is it. I think it was the last game.

26:11.000 --> 26:19.000
OK. I'm playing. Yeah. Yeah. OK. So Forza 8. What else. I'm trying to think.

26:20.000 --> 26:26.000
I don't know. Can we get some DLC for like Crackdown 3 to make me actually want to play it again because I've stopped playing that game.

26:27.000 --> 26:35.000
I'm not having fun with it anymore. It would be cool if we got some VR thing from Microsoft and maybe do the mixed reality stuff I guess.

26:36.000 --> 26:43.000
But like maybe actually Xbox wise would be kind of cool. I don't know. I just want something like out of left field.

26:44.000 --> 26:54.000
You know what. I'm going to put all my all my chips on the Amico. OK. I need to have all of like the amazing announcements coming from the television side.

26:55.000 --> 27:03.000
That's right. Chuckle. But at the same time I'm super curious like what their plan is. I actually legit want to see some of what they're working on. Yeah.

27:04.000 --> 27:13.000
I don't know. I don't really know would be like really like I want a new Saints Row game can get a new Saints Row game reboot that shit.

27:14.000 --> 27:25.000
All right. I'm going to say I think you know obviously you know Microsoft has very different leadership now and I think they're a lot more in tune with what their players are kind of asking for and what they want than they were historically.

27:25.000 --> 27:38.000
Long story short I think I think a Fable 4 is in the works. Yeah I can see that. I think Microsoft probably knows that role playing games RPGs fantasies is kind of one of their weak points whereas Fable was historically a strong point for them.

27:39.000 --> 27:48.000
And I wouldn't be surprised if they gave Fable to one of their other. Well didn't do wasn't speaking of horizon wasn't the thing that turned 10 was working on an RPG or something.

27:48.000 --> 27:58.000
So I don't know I kind of I feel like Fable 4 is going to be a thing if not that then Microsoft's got some time maybe because of Molinu not really being involved anymore which may not be a bad thing.

27:59.000 --> 28:08.000
Oh who cares. Maybe they're going to maybe they're going to launch a new IP that's a new RPG. Yes I'm sure I'm sure Fable is just going to suffer from Molinu not being part of it.

28:09.000 --> 28:21.000
No but it might be complicated in using Fable. If they do a Fable it has to be completely off the rails. Oh sure. Completely. Oh you mean like a role playing game like a real role playing game.

28:22.000 --> 28:33.000
Oh you oh you want it to be more like Dragon Age. OK. Although I would totally be down for a medieval saints. Right. Yeah actually it's just so stupid that I love that.

28:33.000 --> 28:42.000
I did evil Saints Row would that be fun. Monty Python the Holy Grail like as a game. And then at the end you get arrested by the police and then a moose fights your sister.

28:43.000 --> 28:55.000
I could I could be down with that. I love I love the absurdity. Dear Eric Idol. Talk to your buddies. But like it can't be seen. So it's got to be like its own franchise but like Saints Row just medieval.

28:55.000 --> 29:06.000
OK. It would be called Saints Row. Jamie what about you as far as like what do you what do you hope. I mean we know we're not going to see anything from Sony but we know we've got Square probably talking about the seven remake.

29:07.000 --> 29:16.000
We've got Nintendo. Twenty one possible titles. We've got Microsoft with four about Bethesda. What do you think Bethesda is going to be announcing during our show that we're not going to stop for.

29:17.000 --> 29:24.000
What other continents are there. Let me come back to that. In the world of Elder Scrolls. Oh well we know we're not getting Elder Scrolls. Oh and Elder Scrolls online expansion.

29:25.000 --> 29:37.000
Oh yeah probably. Maybe. Yeah. I don't know. I really kind of stopped predicting certain things just because I've developed this sort of thing that I want to be.

29:38.000 --> 29:48.000
You set an expectation and then ultimately get let down when you use many predictions. I want to find only I want to be delighted by something you know you're getting Animal Crossing.

29:48.000 --> 30:05.000
So yeah that's really all I give a shit about. But in the end though I really want to be pleasantly surprised by what comes out. I want it to be a oh well I wasn't expecting that instead of me going oh you're going to do this it's going to be great and it ends up being shit.

30:06.000 --> 30:21.000
Well let me ask let me ask you this since you are such an Animal Crossing fan. Do you think. Don't die. Excuse me for animal still getting over a cold. Do you think for Animal Crossing on the switch. Do you think Nintendo is just going to stick to that formula that's worked that they've kind of kept kept with all the other games.

30:22.000 --> 30:40.000
Yeah makes it up. They've tried to do something different every time. What I would like to see for Animal Crossing switches for it to be a combination of all the previous ones. I want the town. I want the customizable little shopping area that you can make yourself like a new leaf.

30:41.000 --> 31:01.000
New Leaf was really I think one of the best of the series. I also wouldn't mind seeing if they were going to say put a Nintendo games in there but not have them be any us have them be like a DLC sort of thing where you can buy like certain Nintendo arcade titles.

31:02.000 --> 31:15.000
Why should I have to. I mean granted the DLC stuff but like if I'm paying for that online pass thing I already have the Nintendo titles that are part there. Why can't I just bring those in. Yeah incorporate then game and watch or something. Oh that'd be cool.

31:16.000 --> 31:40.000
Yeah you find game and watch things. Yeah I'd like that. You know or I think like for some of the you remember how you could get the old Nintendo toys like the was the ultra the ultra stack or whatever that you can get those toys and actually be able to play with them or something or having learned how to put in you know and have it be like a Nintendo themed deck or something.

31:40.000 --> 31:54.000
OK. Or you know have it. I just think that there are other things that they could do that there's been the potential to do and actually do it well. And on top of that why not even incorporate the board game.

31:55.000 --> 32:10.000
You know what's that game that I bought and played like four times the Mass Effect. No the Nintendo the Animal Crossing amiibo one amiibo festival. Oh yeah yeah. And then have like you can have a job as a happy home designer.

32:10.000 --> 32:23.000
Why not incorporate all of it together or have it like stream you're like take your saves or something and be able to sink it over to your switch and or your pocket camp integration.

32:23.000 --> 32:33.000
OK. That'd be cool. That would be cool. And then you could do like the your pocket camp could be like your island. Yeah. Oh bringing back the island like that. I don't trust Nintendo to do online.

32:33.000 --> 32:40.000
I was like I was like that'd be cool. We'll see. We're talking Nintendo here. I know all those expectations are down down.

32:40.000 --> 33:02.000
But I mean those are things that I would love to see in an Animal Crossing. I think it would be a lot of fun. It would added especially then given. Sorry I'm dying to especially incorporating in just all the other things that they have out there all of their other tools that they brought in the previous animal crossings and then go back to

33:02.000 --> 33:14.000
look on YouTube. There are things that didn't carry over into other animal crossings that I think they could look back to the past things that people loved and bring those in.

33:14.000 --> 33:26.000
You know you could have more transitional seasons for example you could do you know a deep sea fishing rodeo I don't know because they love fishing and bug catching and shit.

33:26.000 --> 33:36.000
I just hope online's a little more seamless as opposed to having to go open the gate and close the gate. I want to go hit the citizens in Dark Soccer's town with a bug net whenever I want just bad luck.

33:36.000 --> 33:45.000
So anyway all right. By the way I had a heart attack because I thought Ed had shown up in pocket camp. But no he's a unicorn and he's fine. His name is Julian.

33:45.000 --> 33:55.000
Ed is Dark Soccer's least favorite animal to have ever crossed. And I want my lesbian back. Dina. Dina who is the gym teacher. All right look.

33:55.000 --> 34:08.000
Enough Animal Crossing for now. Here's what we're going to. So one week from tonight OLR will be back at our usual time six o'clock Pacific nine o'clock Eastern. Here's the thing. In years past we have paused the show for Bethesda's press conference.

34:08.000 --> 34:21.000
However this year they've changed the time so that they are starting at five thirty and assumably going to about six thirty or seven. We don't know. I'm making a judgment call this year we're not going to stop the show for Bethesda's conference because we know we're not getting starfield.

34:21.000 --> 34:32.000
We know we're not getting Elder Scrolls six. And that's not to knock the things that we are going to hear about. But I think there are things that we can kind of you know Loki's looking at all sorts of things that laptop. I'm sure he'll have Bethesda's thing.

34:33.000 --> 34:49.000
If there's something we need to know about he can pipe in as the show is going. But otherwise I think we're going to just do a normal show next week. But here's the other thing. This time next week we will know Microsoft's mysteries. We will know these 14 games because Microsoft is going earlier in the day they're going in the afternoon.

34:49.000 --> 34:59.000
I will not know because I know I will be here. I won't know until the show because I'm going to be working pride. Oh that's right. SAC Pride.

34:59.000 --> 35:09.000
Pride is it's Saturday and Sunday and the sisters are working with talent. OK. So so next week we'll get to say hi to Lizzo for you.

35:09.000 --> 35:23.000
I love Lizzo. Anyway next week I will we'll get to play a fun game here in studio called tell Jamie what she missed at E3 and we'll gauge her reaction. Maybe if I have time I'll try to put together a little slide show and we can put things up on the TV.

35:23.000 --> 35:35.000
Maybe I'll show up in face. I don't want to come up here and I'll be wiping the face off when I come here. It'll be Jamie with like no makeup and white streaks all over from my back in the chair and they can hardly see you anyway.

35:35.000 --> 35:57.000
I'll go on cam if I'm in face. All right. I'll show people what a sister looks like. You know what a sister of perpetual indulgence looks like. Anyway. So yeah. Next week business as usual as far as our schedule. I've talked to Bobby Black Wolf. He was thinking he's not going to. He's business as usual for Bobby as well. So we will update you on Bethesda what's going on there as the night goes on.

35:57.000 --> 36:20.000
But I'm not expecting none of us are expecting anything where we're going to suddenly just stop the show and go Oh my God out of Bethesda. So yeah. My expectations are very high there. I mean not and not to poop with their offerings. I'm sure there's going to be a new Elder Scrolls Online expansion. That's great for the fans of that game. There's probably going to be with the Wolfenstein Wolfenstein will be something something for Fallout 76.

36:20.000 --> 36:47.000
You know something to fall out. I could see a new Vegas remastered or like Oblivion remaster or something like that. But like I mean I am not expecting anything new. Like I don't know. So what we won't know this time next week we will not know Nintendo's offerings. They are not going until they don't go till Tuesday morning right. Yeah. Monday was always the Sony day which is Ubisoft still doing there.

36:47.000 --> 37:01.000
I believe Ubisoft is Monday morning and squares where it's going to take any spot Monday night. The only other person on Saturday EA will have gone. So if there is a Dragon Age thing for Jamie we'll know that on Saturday.

37:01.000 --> 37:11.000
Oh if there's a Dragon Age thing though I will be looking for that because I want to punch soulless in his face. Yeah. So that's really what issue we call Dragon Age 4 punch soulless in the face.

37:11.000 --> 37:23.000
All right. So that's that's where E3 is at. So E3 hysteria will be underway one week from tonight. We'll at least be able to recap Microsoft kind of Bethesda as it's going on and Bobby clarifies Ubisoft set Monday at 1 p.m. OK.

37:23.000 --> 37:36.000
That's what. So I'll be watching that work. Who was always Monday morning was Ubisoft the first thing on Mondays. No it was. Yeah they were kind of pretty early in the morning I think. And then EA used to go on Mondays too.

37:37.000 --> 37:51.000
Sometimes. Yeah it was like during the day I think. Yeah I feel like at one point I felt like Microsoft was the first thing Monday morning I think a couple of years ago they moved back to some Bobby says in chat that squinting is Monday at 6 p.m.

37:51.000 --> 38:06.000
OK. Nintendo's Tuesday at 9 a.m. is Saturday at 915 a.m. OK. That's all kind of what I was thinking actually. So yeah I just I always thought there was another oh the P.C. show. That's a Monday thing in it. Are they not doing it. They're doing it this year.

38:06.000 --> 38:16.000
Yeah. But we don't. I mean have we ever gotten anything that made us scream out of the. No no. But when's the Volvers. When's Devolver Digital.

38:16.000 --> 38:32.000
Devolver is at the end of our I believe they're Sunday night towards the end of OLR. OK. Yeah. So that's really where it's at. All right. Yeah. Bobby clarify Sunday 7 p.m. So all right. Thank you. Bobby's given us all the updates in chat. This is this is a Bob. Bobby's the manager here.

38:32.000 --> 38:49.000
Yeah. It looks like P.C. game shows in the morning. All right. OK. So the P.C. game show I think took a space that we used to be something else. But anyway we'll we'll deal with all that. So we'll talk about E3 and what's going on next week here on the show and of course reacting with you guys here.

38:50.000 --> 39:05.000
What I haven't talked to Bobby about so. So Bobby and I both have day jobs as well as you know everybody else here in studio. So we can't really do like a live thing for Nintendo although I believe some folks will be gathering here in the chat room and we'll be hosting Nintendo's thing.

39:05.000 --> 39:21.000
But for Square Enix we might be able to do something. So I'll talk to Bobby about that later if maybe we want to do a video thing during Square Enix and and do that. That thing which I usually don't like where people talk over the press conference and all that stuff.

39:21.000 --> 39:37.000
But I think I think we can put our own spin on it and not have it be so irritating. I'll never forget the year I found. Oh finally somebody is streaming the Nintendo thing and it's just some guy going this looks like shit. Fucking Nintendo would need to put all this shitty stuff.

39:37.000 --> 39:44.000
And I'm just like oh my God delete your account. Like why are you streaming if all you're going to talk is shit about this. Anyway.

39:44.000 --> 39:52.000
S2100 Matt says a post show sass fest. Maybe something like that. But a little but but sass like like the good kind of sass.

39:52.000 --> 40:12.000
So the sass and Creed sass and Creed sassy screen. Thanks I hate it. All right. Let's move on that you know I'm fabulous here. Let's get into our gaming week and the types of video games that we have been playing this week.

40:13.000 --> 40:22.000
Dark Sakura how was your gaming week. Did you get to play some games on your trip. Well it's been two weeks. Maybe I did some ingress I did some Pokemon. I did a lot of Pokemon go actually.

40:22.000 --> 40:28.000
And of course you know Animal Crossing pocket camp. You know it's all just stuff I had on my phone.

40:28.000 --> 40:42.000
I don't really get to do any like constantly things although Dan and I we've been working you know trying to get this stuff together to do our stream but we have to get the this thing set up on our CRT and we just read it our office.

40:42.000 --> 40:53.000
So we're debating if it's going to be Symphony of the night. But I kind of want to do the Saturn version so I can just play through the whole thing as Maria.

40:53.000 --> 41:04.000
Or you know we were thinking of a link to the past. So we haven't decided. I'm thinking I'm leaning toward Castlevania I've been watching a stream of it and I was like fuck I love this game.

41:04.000 --> 41:17.000
Why is this bitch using the heavenly sword and not getting the yes it sooner which is the best fucking weapon in the game. You get that and two rings of Varda. You are a whiz.

41:17.000 --> 41:23.000
No one can stop you. Have you picked up the Castlevania collection. No you should.

41:23.000 --> 41:36.000
It's fun. I don't know. I know. I mean we've already got all of those games on other things. Yes it's sort of like what's the point. I guess that's true. I'm looking forward to the Japanese update that's going to let me play like the Famicom version of Castlevania 3.

41:36.000 --> 41:45.000
That'll be cool. That would make it worthwhile because we were even talking about that that you know when you go to fight in Symphony of the night when you go to fight.

41:45.000 --> 42:02.000
Grant and Saifa and Trevor Grant can throw his his knives whereas in the US one in Castlevania 3 you could throw them in Castlevania 3 the Japanese one but in the US one it was stabby stab.

42:03.000 --> 42:12.000
Quest busters reminded me in chat that a blood stained is happening this month. I forgot about that. Blood stained is happening. Exciting. And that will be stellar.

42:12.000 --> 42:24.000
Anything else for you Dark Sakura. Let's go to Loki. How was your gaming week. I played a little bit of Dance Dance Revolution this week and been trying to get back into that again.

42:24.000 --> 42:39.000
And I also did bust out a little bit on the Oculus Rift. So I played I tried Minecraft in VR. It was all right. It was neat. Just messing around and creative in that.

42:39.000 --> 42:58.000
I didn't like the one thing I didn't like about it though is I was trying to use the crossbow and wherever you would think intuitively that like wherever you're pointing is where you should be aiming the arrow but it was like aiming it like where I was looking sort of but not quite.

42:59.000 --> 43:14.000
And so you can never really hit anything with it which is kind of annoying. And then I tried the they have this like free like VR experiencing for Coco. So I tried that and I couldn't figure out what he wanted me to do.

43:14.000 --> 43:23.000
It's like go on stage. I'm like OK I don't know how to get there. And like that like I was walking around doing all the crap that they wanted me to do and I couldn't fucking figure it out.

43:23.000 --> 43:37.000
So I deleted it because this is stupid. And then what else. A little bit of vacation simulator. I'm playing that. It's not as fun as job simulator unfortunately. That's the bad thing.

43:38.000 --> 43:52.000
But it's all right. And then. Yeah that's pretty much it. All right. My gaming week. So I talked about my weekend in Chicago and all that anger stuff so that was that barely touched Pokemon Go as a result.

43:52.000 --> 44:02.000
But that's OK. I kind of need something really to excite me about Pokemon Go again and these raids are do I mean I did I did I will say I did one Pokemon raid in Chicago.

44:02.000 --> 44:13.000
Some site some type of Abraham Lincoln statue. We were walking around this park one day. I was actually with Misty or she met us in Chicago and hung out with us for a little bit one day and we did a Pokemon raid at some at Lincoln Park.

44:13.000 --> 44:22.000
We did a statue raid and that as Zell for whatever it is I didn't catch it. I was frustrated. This is probably the one time I'm going to get to raid this thing and there it goes.

44:22.000 --> 44:28.000
But hopefully somebody will take pity on me and train me one. We'll see. But otherwise that's that's really it for that game.

44:28.000 --> 44:34.000
So I've been playing a little bit of the Castlevania collection on PlayStation 4 because I picked that up right when it came out.

44:34.000 --> 44:42.000
I've also been playing a little more Final Fantasy 14. There's an interesting event going on right now which encourages you to do some of the older content.

44:42.000 --> 44:54.000
It's probably to help get people in the queues for that old content to help everybody get caught up for the new expansion that's coming out of the end of month which by the way I would bet that Microsoft getting Final Fantasy 14.

44:54.000 --> 45:02.000
That seems like that's got to happen sooner rather than later. It seems weird that they still don't have it especially now in this era of like cross play is not really an issue anymore.

45:02.000 --> 45:10.000
Everybody's kind of let down their guard on that. Like I don't know what's holding back on Final Fantasy 14 and Xbox One. So I would think that's going to be a thing that happens.

45:10.000 --> 45:18.000
But anyway I've been playing a lot of Diablo 3 as well. I usually there's one Blizzard game I'll start playing the shit out of for a month or so.

45:18.000 --> 45:26.000
And I was starting it the last time we talked but without a power level I got all the way to 70 and I think I'm paragon 50 now.

45:26.000 --> 45:36.000
And I just cleared my level 20 greater rift so I can get my six piece set in Diablo 3. For those that play the game and understand exactly what I just said. I just did all that stuff.

45:36.000 --> 45:45.000
So I've been having fun with that. While I was on my flight I enjoyed the classic NES library because you know once you check in online it's good for seven days.

45:45.000 --> 45:54.000
So I was able to play on the plane so I was playing I was playing Super Mario 2 quite a bit. That's kind of like my go to NES game that I'll do a play through every few months or so.

45:54.000 --> 46:00.000
Like let's go kick warts ass because it only takes about not even an hour to get through. It's a pretty fast game if you use all the warp zones.

46:00.000 --> 46:07.000
So I played a little bit of that on the plane and I was playing some other Switch games too. So I played Tetris 99 offline.

46:07.000 --> 46:17.000
You can do that with the new big piece DLC or whatever it is that they released. So I was able to play that on the plane a little bit against computer opponents.

46:17.000 --> 46:29.000
And I can win when it's the computer. So that made me feel really good. I won a match on that. So that was pretty exciting. Otherwise that was pretty much my gamer week. So there's that.

46:29.000 --> 46:41.000
So yeah. Looking in chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network. Run Jump Stomp I believe this comment is about Final Fantasy 14 saying the thing that's holding its back is Sony I'm sure.

46:41.000 --> 46:51.000
But this time unlike Final Fantasy 11 when Play Online was kind of like a joint venture between Sony and Square. Sony doesn't really have a thing with Final Fantasy 14.

46:51.000 --> 47:05.000
I mean because Sony excuse me Final Fantasy 14 was always playable with the console PlayStation and PC. Sony never had a problem with that end of it probably because they know it's like more like an MMO and this is what Square wants to do.

47:05.000 --> 47:16.000
It seemed like Microsoft when 14 was being developed was the holdout. But you know 14 started development six seven years ago and I just think the cross play rules have changed a lot.

47:16.000 --> 47:24.000
I kind of don't think I guess that's my really long winded way of saying when it comes to Final Fantasy 14 specifically that game I don't think it matters what Sony wants.

47:24.000 --> 47:34.000
I think Square already has the buy in for Sony to do cross play on that because 14 has always supported the PC and the PlayStation at least since Realm Reborn.

47:34.000 --> 47:40.000
1.0 was garbage and wasn't even on the PlayStation 3 or 4. But ever since Realm Reborn.

47:40.000 --> 47:48.000
Let's see I guess that's it. That's it for my gaming week. Let's get into some gaming news shall we?

47:48.000 --> 47:59.000
Yes. All right. So this is a pretty what the stream accidentally cut out because my fat finger hit the wrong button.

47:59.000 --> 48:06.000
And so we're having an issue where the stream is cut out and it is completely my fault and I'm going to hope we're back online shortly.

48:06.000 --> 48:12.000
But go ahead and start the next story for us Loki. All right. So this is pretty exciting.

48:12.000 --> 48:24.000
But apparently they're going to be bringing the bringing Xbox Game Pass to PC finally because I've been asking for this to happen for the longest time.

48:24.000 --> 48:31.000
So that's pretty cool. So what they're going to be doing is a little bit different than how it's working on the Xbox One.

48:31.000 --> 48:38.000
But there'll be I guess 100 games which will be playable on many of which are on Xbox One.

48:38.000 --> 48:46.000
But of those also a lot of them are going to be these Universal Windows apps that will support different Windows 32 applications.

48:46.000 --> 48:50.000
And they're going to have other third party games in there as well.

48:50.000 --> 48:57.000
So like from Deep Silver, Sega, Devolver Digital, Paradox, Bethesda, that type of stuff.

48:57.000 --> 49:04.000
And I'm going to stop you right there for just a minute because we're going to do just a quick little thing here that I'm going to have to edit in post-production to try to fix our stream tonight.

49:04.000 --> 49:08.000
But we will be right back. So after a little tech fail, we are back.

49:08.000 --> 49:11.000
Yes. So lots of different third party publishers.

49:11.000 --> 49:17.000
And of course, you know, just like the Xbox One, you're also going to get the day and date stuff like the brand new games.

49:17.000 --> 49:22.000
Gears of War five. They mentioned the Age of Empires one through three definitive editions.

49:22.000 --> 49:27.000
They're also going to be getting in the Master Chief collection on PC.

49:27.000 --> 49:33.000
And then I would assume, you know, whatever new games they announced this year, those are going to probably be day and date with this stuff.

49:33.000 --> 49:40.000
So I don't know. It sounds pretty awesome. I don't know when this is going into effect, but I guess we're supposed to learn more about it.

49:40.000 --> 49:43.000
Probably during E3. So in like a week or so.

49:43.000 --> 49:48.000
That would be a very logical time for them to explain everything about this on the PC.

49:48.000 --> 49:55.000
So I'd be curious. But I mean, that sounds like a good deal to me. It sounds like a good deal was on on the Xbox One.

49:55.000 --> 50:00.000
I just on Xbox One. So I was like, I'd do it if it was on PC.

50:00.000 --> 50:06.000
Well, now it is. I think. Yeah, I I'm I'm excited to see what it is on PC.

50:06.000 --> 50:11.000
I'm I would probably pick this up if I can do it on PC. I would love one that's both.

50:11.000 --> 50:16.000
Do you think it'll be both where if I pay once I can get it on both sides? Because that would be amazing.

50:16.000 --> 50:20.000
I think there's different things on the PC one, so maybe they will.

50:20.000 --> 50:26.000
But or maybe if you like to subscribe to it, you get this on PC and this on the Xbox. I don't know.

50:26.000 --> 50:31.000
I'd be OK with that. I guess we'll find out. Yes. We stay tuned for the press conference.

50:31.000 --> 50:38.000
All right. Sounds good. Moving on to a story over on the Nintendo Switch and Super Mario Maker 2.

50:38.000 --> 50:42.000
So some more details came out on Super Mario Maker 2. Some of them good, some of them not so good.

50:42.000 --> 50:48.000
So let's start with the bad news, because this was all over Twitter and had a lot of people going WTF, Nintendo.

50:48.000 --> 50:56.000
Give me a break. Super Mario Maker 2 will limit the online multiplayer to random players only.

50:56.000 --> 51:00.000
You can still play with your friends if you play local wireless play.

51:00.000 --> 51:06.000
But a Nintendo representative explained Nintendo's reasoning is that with global leaderboards,

51:06.000 --> 51:10.000
the matchmaking for a competitive play would be compromised if you could play with friends.

51:10.000 --> 51:16.000
That limitation also extends to co-op play as well, despite those not being leaderboard driven.

51:16.000 --> 51:25.000
So they couldn't have just if you're playing with friends, have maybe just not put those on leaderboards or will pop up that says no one has friends.

51:25.000 --> 51:30.000
Rob, here's here's the thing is like the local the local play that they have is unranked anyway.

51:30.000 --> 51:36.000
So you couldn't put unranked in multiplayer as well online.

51:36.000 --> 51:39.000
I know it's it's I don't get it.

51:39.000 --> 51:46.000
It's it's because I know it's because we just don't want to build matchmaking servers is what we don't want to do.

51:46.000 --> 51:54.000
And so we're just going randomly. But but then again, I guess you can play Mario Kart with your friends and you can do Splatoon with your.

51:54.000 --> 51:57.000
Does it make sense? Although you couldn't at first, but there's.

51:57.000 --> 52:01.000
Well, here's the thing, though, like they're trying to like solve a problem that's not even there yet.

52:01.000 --> 52:08.000
And like you would like I think they did something similar, like Splatoon 2, where they tried to like limit you in certain ways that you can play on there.

52:08.000 --> 52:13.000
But it still didn't stop the people from hacking the game and cheating like crazy.

52:13.000 --> 52:21.000
It's not going to stop it here in Mario Maker either. It's just going to be people are doing it in other ways and not necessarily playing your friends to exploit stuff.

52:21.000 --> 52:25.000
I just think it's you're trying to solve for a problem that's not even a problem yet.

52:25.000 --> 52:40.000
And on top of that, hopefully there won't be any like related voice business with any of it, because I'm sure as many other people of the female persuasion know online play is a very toxic environment.

52:40.000 --> 52:48.000
Well, even if there was Nintendo, you have to jump through loopholes by using their app to get voice chat anyway, which most people don't bother with.

52:48.000 --> 52:57.000
So it's kind of assumed that most people aren't using voice chat. Most people that game on the Switch with their friends and the game and the games allow you to do that, just use Discord or something or a Skype call or something.

52:57.000 --> 53:01.000
Right, which is but if you won't be able to play with your friends.

53:01.000 --> 53:05.000
Yeah, it's an it's again putting someone into a toxic environment.

53:05.000 --> 53:10.000
Oh, yeah. And I wouldn't I would never use voice chat with playing with randos and I'm probably not going to use the feature to play with randos.

53:10.000 --> 53:27.000
It's not really something I'm interested in doing. But like I was really excited about the potential of going live on Twitch and doing a co stream with Bobby or Delvin or one of my streaming friends, and we could stream a level on Mario maker together.

53:27.000 --> 53:38.000
And that would have been really fun. But now we can't do that because this design is stupid. So I'm hoping it's one of those things that they're going to fix pretty quickly out the gate.

53:38.000 --> 53:44.000
You know, to be fair, again, I don't think Splatoon had it right away and they ended up building it in. So maybe the same.

53:44.000 --> 53:49.000
You can always add it later and be like, we listen to you. We listen to you.

53:49.000 --> 53:54.000
Part of our roadmap all along. Yes. Anyway, so maybe some good news.

53:54.000 --> 53:58.000
The roadmap to help. Some good news. You know, I said the bad news. Here's some good news.

53:58.000 --> 54:04.000
So all the building features in Super Mario Maker 2 are unlocked from the start.

54:04.000 --> 54:09.000
So you don't have to actually unlock things as you go or anything like that.

54:09.000 --> 54:13.000
The level builder will have all of the features unlocked from the start. So you don't have to worry.

54:13.000 --> 54:17.000
You know, even though there's like a single player mode or you're rebuilding the castles, nothing's going to be locked.

54:17.000 --> 54:22.000
Yeah, that kind of sucked the first time or any other kind of like time jump and stuff in order to unlock things.

54:22.000 --> 54:28.000
So that's that's some good news, I guess, to kind of, you know, say say something good to go with the bad.

54:28.000 --> 54:32.000
I haven't now what I haven't heard is is all that amiibo stuff coming back?

54:32.000 --> 54:37.000
I don't think so. Oh, that's a bummer. I kind of like that. Yeah, I don't think there's any amiibo support whatsoever.

54:37.000 --> 54:41.000
Oh, no. Where you can get all the different Mario skins. No, I don't think that they have that.

54:41.000 --> 54:48.000
Oh, that's kind of that's sad. I'm not kind of like I understand that people are not crazy about amiibo, but I was cool.

54:48.000 --> 54:57.000
You could do and it wasn't all amiibo either. There was like competitions online that you would if you cleared a certain map, you would unlock a skin that you could.

54:57.000 --> 55:02.000
Yeah, I like that stuff. I'm kind of I'm pretty sure I read that it's not.

55:02.000 --> 55:06.000
Yeah. Chatters chatters are echoing that, saying no amiibo support amiibo are done.

55:06.000 --> 55:09.000
Why? I don't know. Amiibo is not done. They're still putting out the new smash ones.

55:09.000 --> 55:20.000
They just they just put one out. Was it that they're afraid that someone's going to find like, I don't know, like hack an update or something like that and spoil the surprise of new amiibo?

55:20.000 --> 55:25.000
I don't know. It seems like a reach. I just I liked that you could have all those.

55:25.000 --> 55:29.000
You would think they already put it in there for the first game, at least support the same.

55:29.000 --> 55:35.000
Oh, whatever. Maybe maybe it has something to do with not wanting to do the skins for other configurations.

55:35.000 --> 55:41.000
But it was always only the retro anyway. You couldn't play those those different like skins. They were only for the eight bit Mario.

55:41.000 --> 55:46.000
Well, yeah. And on top of that, you know, too, they also have that preorder bonus.

55:46.000 --> 55:52.000
It's only in Europe now, which doesn't make any sense either. There's a lot of weird stuff with Mario maker right now.

55:52.000 --> 55:57.000
So I hope Nintendo kind of gets on the right path and gets that all figured out because this game's out of the we're in June now.

55:57.000 --> 56:01.000
Right. This game's out at the end of the month because it's coming out for my birthday.

56:01.000 --> 56:07.000
So I'm excited about that. So. All right. Well, there you go. Super Mario maker to Dark Sakura.

56:07.000 --> 56:15.000
What do you have for us? I have naps, lots and lots of naps and some disappointment.

56:15.000 --> 56:21.000
Pokemon sleep. Have you heard of it? It's what the opposite of go is.

56:21.000 --> 56:26.000
It helps you level your pokey man's while you sleep in. It's a sleep monitor.

56:26.000 --> 56:32.000
Pokemon, go take a nap. Yeah. Pokemon, go take a nap. Pokemon, go to bed. I wanna.

56:32.000 --> 56:39.000
And of course, that's why we have all the Snorlax's sees all over the place because of sleep.

56:39.000 --> 56:47.000
But, you know, they missed an opportunity because they have a sleeping Pikachu and it should have fucking been Jigglypuff with a mic singing you the fuck to sleep.

56:47.000 --> 56:54.000
It's set to come out in 2020 and it's going to work with a little thing called the Pokemon go plus plus.

56:54.000 --> 57:05.000
That's the name of it. The good Pokemon go plus plus. Which will have a sleeping tracker, which you would then put by your pillow for it to monitor your sleeping.

57:05.000 --> 57:15.000
I'm pretty sure that since the Pokemon go app works on Apple Watch for now, that's coming up later in the show.

57:15.000 --> 57:27.000
That hopefully they would see the well, maybe value of partnering since adventure sync is a thing in Pokemon go using your watch data to walk your Pokemon.

57:27.000 --> 57:33.000
Maybe it will use your watch data or whatever. We keep saying Apple Watch because Jamie and I are Apple people, but I know you're a Fitbit guy.

57:33.000 --> 57:35.000
Same thing, right?

57:35.000 --> 57:37.000
I have a workaround, but it works with adventure sync.

57:37.000 --> 57:44.000
It's the same thing. Maybe the Fitbit. Just Fitbit monitor your sleep. Does it have a little light to do heart rate and all that stuff?

57:44.000 --> 57:47.000
Yes, if I wear this at night it will monitor my sleep.

57:47.000 --> 58:00.000
I use this to monitor my sleep. I charge my watch and I'm in the shower and I charge it because we all know that when you go to bed, you're really lying in bed playing on your phone for 30 more minutes.

58:00.000 --> 58:07.000
So I will charge my watch while I'm in bed, but not in bed yet. That's enough to get my watch through the day.

58:07.000 --> 58:11.000
I let it actually monitor my sleep and it's very interesting.

58:11.000 --> 58:17.000
Yesterday, I didn't talk about this, but I also went to an Ingress thing yesterday called First Saturday and I walked a lot yesterday.

58:17.000 --> 58:23.000
I walked like five miles and I was doing a lot of micro-fielding and stuff and I got my heart rate up.

58:23.000 --> 58:27.000
So when I slept last night, my heart rate decreased by 28%, which is really good.

58:27.000 --> 58:30.000
So that's something that my sleep monitor kind of tells me.

58:30.000 --> 58:33.000
It's interesting. It's not life-changing, but it's interesting.

58:33.000 --> 58:41.000
If I didn't have to sleep with a brace on my left wrist, which is the wrist I wear my watch on, I might give that a try.

58:41.000 --> 58:50.000
So no guarantee that watches or Fitbits or any of it are going to work.

58:50.000 --> 59:00.000
It's still stupid though that I should buy another app. Even if, let's just say, I have a Gotcha, but I don't have the Pokemon Go Plus or whatever.

59:00.000 --> 59:03.000
But now I have to buy another one to use this?

59:03.000 --> 59:05.000
Yeah, it's going to be like $35.

59:05.000 --> 59:10.000
So no, that's not going to happen. And it better work on my watch.

59:10.000 --> 59:14.000
Yeah, I'm interested if it works on my watch. I'm not if I have to buy yet another accessory.

59:14.000 --> 59:18.000
And how's it supposed to work anyways? You're not even wearing it.

59:19.000 --> 59:26.000
Well, as I was going to say, it actually is being developed by Select Button that worked on Magikarp Jump.

59:26.000 --> 59:36.000
And basically it's supposed to, you connect it to your phone, for the Go Plus Plus anyway, to send your sleep data as you sleep wearing it.

59:36.000 --> 59:39.000
Although it said something about like putting it beside your pillow as well.

59:39.000 --> 59:43.000
That's what I'm deaf saying in chat. It isn't one that you wear, you put it by your pillow.

59:43.000 --> 59:44.000
How the hell does that work?

59:44.000 --> 59:46.000
There are sleep monitors that work under your pillow.

59:46.000 --> 59:52.000
And Bobby is mentioning something about that he has a sleep monitor in the bed. So I'm sure there's like mattresses that do that too.

59:52.000 --> 59:53.000
Smart mattresses?

59:53.000 --> 59:54.000
Yeah, something like that.

59:54.000 --> 59:55.000
Yeah, I know.

59:55.000 --> 59:56.000
That's scary.

59:56.000 --> 59:57.000
I'm sure it's a thing.

59:57.000 --> 01:00:07.000
No, there are. It was called like Bedom or something or bed something that was a smart mattress to monitor your sleep.

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:11.000
We detected sex. We're going to add it to your exercise for the day.

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:15.000
Bobby in chat says sleep IQ is what they call it on sleep number beds.

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:23.000
Yeah, but on top of that, there are monitors that you put under your pillow that actually track your movement in your sleep.

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:32.000
Like how often you're moving around. If you fall into REM sleep, you don't move ideally unless you're just, you know, an active sleeper.

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:38.000
We've detected only half the weight in the bed tonight. Did you make your husband sleep on the couch? Yes or no?

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:50.000
At any rate, it's interesting. I'm probably going to give it a try. Okay, so yeah, this thing is it's actually 40 bucks, I think, for the for the thing.

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000
I'm hating it more and more, Jamie.

01:00:52.000 --> 01:01:11.000
And then, yeah, and of course, then they also talked about, you know, bringing out Switch games, but they said something about a cloud based service called Pokemon Home that lets you link your phone and your Switch so that you can do your Pokemon together.

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:20.000
Huh? I wonder if we didn't put enough about it here. We have a Pokemon direct on Jenny coming up in this next week, I think just before E3.

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:24.000
So that's another thing that we'll be talking about next week's show is that we'll know a little more on Pokemon Gen 8.

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:30.000
And maybe when they talk a little more about Pokemon Sword Shield, they might explain that a little better than they have. Don't forget about Pokemon gun.

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:38.000
I'm still waiting for Pokemon gun. Here's the thing. Act F in chat says 40 US dollars doesn't seem that bad. You're right.

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:44.000
But here's here's the problem I'm having. So we had the Pokemon Go Plus the first year. Do you have any tacos that would be?

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:53.000
Then last year it was the Pokemon Go Ball. The Ball Plus. The Ball Plus. And now it's a Pokemon Go Plus. I'm sorry. No, no, we're done with hardware.

01:01:53.000 --> 01:02:04.000
Exactly. I bought the Ball Plus thing just to play around with that one game and I've used it before as a Pokemon Go Plus type thing.

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:11.000
I have a Gotcha. I'm not buying another piece of hardware because I already have some of the monitors, but I don't need to wear two things.

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:18.000
She doesn't have any of that shit. I won't blame Nintendo for the Gotcha because that is a third party device that they probably don't like. Let's be real.

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:26.000
I'm not going to count the Gotcha against them. But you know, the reality is I'm just I'm not interested in another piece of Pokemon hardware for this.

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:31.000
If it does something in addition with Gen 8 or something, maybe I'll revisit. I want the Eevee Tamagotchi.

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:36.000
But for now, I just think Pokemon Sleep ought to work with Watches and Fitbits.

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000
I think it should.

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:48.000
An act-deaf confesses in chat, I'm a Poke Plus whore. Alright, well then that's all. You know what? From somebody who has bought Mass Effect 3 four times, I'm not going to criticize you. You do you, boo.

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:57.000
And also I have to see what exactly the advantages. How is this going to tie in with Pokemon Go? I mean, like what advantages are we getting for paying $40?

01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:00.000
I'm going to wait for the IRL reviews.

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:01.000
Fair enough.

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:06.000
But I'm probably not going to get it because honestly, I don't fucking need it to enjoy my Pokemon games.

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:15.000
Fair. Alright, more to come probably next week after the big Pokemon Direct that we know is coming this week. So in the meantime, we will move on with another story. Loki.

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:30.000
So this is kind of neat. Google is basically putting out new Play Store policies requiring game developers to show players what the chances are of getting items contained in loot boxes.

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:48.000
In random loot boxes, I should say. And part of this, I guess, it says that apps offering mechanisms to receive randomized virtual items from a purchase, i.e. loot box, must clearly disclose the odds of receiving those items in advance of purchase.

01:03:49.000 --> 01:04:02.000
So apparently, Apple has similar rules already for at least a few years. But it's interesting to see that this is something that is being forced on multiple's friends now.

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:10.000
Which is good because they also have legislation going in that's supposed to remove these types of microtransactions as well.

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:25.000
So yeah, it'll be interesting to see what effect this has on mobile games. Because there's a lot, Jesus Christ, tons of mobile games with loot boxes. So we'll see what this does.

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:39.000
There's a lot, but I will give Google credit here because I believe it was on the last episode, or the one before, we were talking about how the US Senate or House is looking to step in and regulate this.

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:50.000
And I said, it is up to Nintendo, Sony, and the ones that run the store. It is up to them at this point to solve this problem, or the problem will be solved for them.

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:59.000
So I will give Google this. They are trying to solve the problem. So I'm going to give polite applause. It's very polite so you might not be able to hear it.

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:11.000
But I'm giving polite applause to Google because this is the direction we have to move in, or the government is going to try to solve it. We don't. This government doesn't solve problems. They create problems. We know that.

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:23.000
So this is a good thing. And you're right. There's a lot of stuff on mobile that does. Now I don't think this can be the only thing that we do. And obviously the other consoles have to figure something out here.

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:38.000
But this is a good step by Google. And we have a big Apple event coming next week as well. We're starting to get rumors about iTunes might be replaced. There's other stuff we're hearing out of Apple. Maybe Apple could do a similar thing.

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.000
Thank God. I hope it happens.

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:46.000
Apple could go a similar direction. They may announce this at the developers conference. We'll see.

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:47.000
I can see.

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000
We need to get an update on this Apple Arcade and all that.

01:05:49.000 --> 01:06:00.000
Yeah, the Arcade stuff. Definitely. As far as the loot box stuff, Apple's had this in place since 2017. So they've had that restriction. I'm curious to see so many announcements.

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:22.000
SSJ 100 Matt in chat says EA has to get on board. They're the problem. I agree with you to an extent SSJ. But consider this. They actually don't have to get on board. Not after what Google just did. So guess what? As far as Android devices are concerned at this point, EA is now on board. Because Google changed it. Does that make sense?

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:35.000
So if PlayStation, Apple, Nintendo, if everybody follows. Well, I'm just saying as far as like the odds, one part of it. I'm not saying the problem's gone. Yay. But this one part of it that could go a long way.

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:55.000
Well, yeah. In order to be on the Play Store, they have to do that. But then again, you know, you have games like Fortnite and stuff. They have their own launchers that you do it externally. So EA could just sidestep the whole store, put out their own store that you download through the Play Store and then or even externally and then sell their games through that.

01:06:55.000 --> 01:07:04.000
And not have to abide by that. But then that would also look kind of shady. Yeah. It'd be like, well, why aren't you disclosing these odds? Because we're assholes.

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:20.000
Some comments in chat about the Apple stuff. Act F says that Apple conference is going to be quite interesting. Bobby, at least it's not the same app. I remember quite often Apple and E3 would be the same week. So that's not happening this time. Apple's next week and then E3 is the week after. So at least we get a reprieve there.

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:33.000
Bobby Black Wolf says, I'm going to miss my iTunes library. Sad face. The one Apple product I use is getting killed. I would think and maybe I don't know if you're saying this in cheek, but I thought it was very obvious that like because everything's in the cloud and Apple knows what you own.

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:39.000
Like whenever they have a new music app or whatever, whatever. Obviously, they're not just killing iTunes. That's something to replace it. So whatever.

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:53.000
Sorry, we got nothing. I'm going to tell you this right now, because, yeah, on the phones, there is the music app. Yeah. There there's a separate TV app. There's a podcast app. There's a podcast app. And I like having them separated.

01:07:53.000 --> 01:08:07.000
And you and it already knows, like the TV app says, oh, you've bought these TV shows. And if you don't like it, apple.com slash feedback. All your stuff is in the cloud. So it's I don't think you're going to lose anything, but it is going to be a little weird.

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:20.000
I will say this. For this very show, Orange Launch Radio, I do all the MP3 tagging and the artwork loading in iTunes. So I'm just going to hope that the standalone music app is just basically iTunes.

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:29.000
So I can continue to kind of do that. Because or I guess I have to figure out how to do it a win app or something else. So yeah, I'm sure I'm sure it'll be fine, though. I'm not too worried about it.

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:37.000
All right. I'm just going to say this. I wouldn't be surprised if some of this goes through the same stuff that goes for book publishing.

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:44.000
For the self-published through Apple Books. I wouldn't be at all surprised if it goes through the same publishing channels.

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:58.000
Bobby Blackwell says most of my iTunes library is ripped CDs, so they don't know. OK, I see what you're saying. But I can't imagine they're just you're not going to just drive unless you have iTunes match or you just drag and drop into the music app.

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:06.000
I doubt they're going to make it that they would know that they're going to get pushback from music lovers that if suddenly the MP3s you created don't work.

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:13.000
I'm sure it'll be easy. I'm not too worried about it. Well, and on top of that, there's also GarageBand is free.

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:20.000
Oh, does GarageBand have like a music library in it? No, but you can you can rip CD. Yeah, but you don't want to do it again if you've ripped like five.

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:28.000
No, I'm saying you can. Your MP3s aren't going to go anywhere. They're still going to be physically on your computer unless you're using iTunes match and put it in the cloud yourself.

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:36.000
Got it. What I'm saying is that you can bring in your own MP3s still in GarageBand to convert them for other purposes.

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:43.000
Got it. OK. All right. All right. Well, let's move on. We know we went from Google all around all around the bed.

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:48.000
We got an update this week on Death Stranding, a pretty big update, in fact, one that might have surprised some people.

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:55.000
Guess what, y'all? Death Stranding is coming out this year. It's a 2019 game. How about that? I still don't know what it's about.

01:09:55.000 --> 01:10:02.000
No, we still don't know what it's about. Babies in jars. And it's it does seem like there's this interesting thing where you don't ever die.

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:10.000
You go to the upside down, which sounds a lot to me like the first version of Prey. Remember Prey the shooter?

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:17.000
Not the recent, but back when it was more like an ID game and the first time they did Prey, you never died.

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:23.000
You went to this like spirit world where you had to like get enough birds and then you went back to and reincarnated.

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:29.000
It is, though. I mean, what if, though, this like whatever other world is, is it literally called the upside down? Because I don't.

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:35.000
I don't think. No, that's like that's a Stranger Things reference. I had a feeling because I was like, really?

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:37.000
Oh, sorry. Go ahead.

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:45.000
What I was going to say is that it makes me think, though, of very Silent Hill things where you had your, I guess, darker world that would come in.

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:49.000
So I think that's more of a nod back to its Silent Hill roots.

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:55.000
Well, to to that point, actually, I swear to God, in the trailer, they mentioned something about P.T.

01:10:55.000 --> 01:11:02.000
So maybe, maybe I'm sure there were unused ideas that are going to show up in this Death Stranding.

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:05.000
It's been a few years, so it looks good.

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:12.000
I just don't know what the hell it's about. But did you see that collector's edition with the actual baby in the jar and all that?

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:15.000
Yes, with the actual baby. Life-size baby.

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:22.000
I don't think I want a baby in a jar. I don't want any babies in jars or outside of jars.

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:26.000
Yeah, I'm going to be passing. Babies are icky. I'm going to pass on that collector's edition as well.

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:28.000
Other people can have babies.

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:30.000
All right. Not this bitch.

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:33.000
What else can other people have? Dark Sakura, next up in news.

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:37.000
Ghosts. Ghost busters, what do you want?

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:40.000
That's the best line in that whole movie, by the way.

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:46.000
So yeah, after a decade, we are getting a remaster of Ghostbusters, the video game.

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:55.000
Which is, for all intents and purposes, the third Ghostbusters movie. The one they wanted to do, right?

01:11:55.000 --> 01:12:02.000
And, I mean, it's got, of course, the, and they, of course, they recorded everything while everyone was still alive.

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:13.000
But, you know, it's got the original cast from the movie. It's got, it's just got a great story. It's a really great game.

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:22.000
And I'm really looking forward to having it, you know, and I'm really glad that it's, you know, a way to keep the franchise alive.

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:31.000
I mean, I'll be honest, I haven't seen the AU version with the female cast, which I should. I own a copy.

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:37.000
But, there's just something nostalgic for all of us who grew up with Ghostbusters.

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:40.000
You know, I've got laserdiscs of Ghostbusters 1 and 2.

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:44.000
And when that game came out, you better believe that we shot right out and got it.

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:50.000
I remember the first first Ghostbusters game on Commodore 64 and Atari 2600, and that game was fun.

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:55.000
And then there was a Ghostbusters 2 game, I remember, on early PCs, like with the VGA graphics, right?

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:58.000
It was pretty good, too. So the Ghostbusters games have always been pretty good.

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:03.000
But I also missed this remaster. You know, some folks in chat are kind of agreeing there.

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:08.000
Questbuster in chat says, it's literally the third movie. Jamie is spot on. Even Ackroyd pretty much said the same thing.

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:15.000
Exactly. What was, if I remember correctly, it was based on one of Ackroyd's screenplays that he had prepared for a third Ghostbusters movie.

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:23.000
So, I'm super, super thrilled. But at any rate, it's going to be out on the modern consoles.

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:29.000
And I'm just really, really, really, really looking forward to it.

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:34.000
But, I mean, it goes back into, you know, back to the Gozer storyline.

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:39.000
And, you know, Ivo Shandor, who was, you know, the main person that they were researching.

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:44.000
And it was just, you know, really such a great game.

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:48.000
And I'm super, super, super, super, super happy that it's coming out.

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:52.000
And I'm probably going to be getting this on PS4.

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:56.000
YYR is pointing out, worth a mention, if you have Xbox One, you don't need the remaster.

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:59.000
Just play the original via backwards compatibility. But, remember...

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:00.000
Don't have an Xbox One.

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:06.000
And remember a few weeks ago, they delisted the game, you know, actually probably a couple months ago at this point.

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:10.000
Now, granted, I'm sure you could find a disc at GameStop or on eBay or something like that.

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:16.000
In fact, now at GameStop on those used games for the Xbox 360, they do market if they're compatible with Xbox One on there.

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:20.000
Interesting. But I would think maybe it's going to drive up the price a little bit.

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:25.000
Probably not like sky high. But I imagine GameStop's going to know, like, oh, people are going to be suddenly interested in this.

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:30.000
Because, you know, I don't see it going sky high. It might go up from like five bucks to ten bucks.

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:33.000
But I'm sure, you know, there's probably still ways to find it.

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:41.000
Well, at any rate, I am super, super, super, super happy. Like, this is me going rawr.

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:46.000
Okay, awesome. All right, moving on. Loki, what do you have for us?

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:54.000
So, you may remember we talked about the Overwatch Workshop, which is a brand new thing that allows players to create their own custom game types and all sorts of weird things.

01:14:54.000 --> 01:15:02.000
What is the most popular mods that are available for Overwatch? Well, the number one mod is UNO.

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:07.000
Yes, that's right, the card game. So you can actually play UNO in Overwatch now.

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:22.000
Some other notable mentions as well. The floor is lava parkour. They have McCree Hot Potato, Hammond Racing, Gun Game, which is, you know, I think from Call of Duty or Battlefield, one of those.

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:32.000
Diva Bumper Cart, Flappy Bird, and well, there's interesting stuff. They have a portal gun mode as well.

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:39.000
And even a Super Smash Brothers mode type that actually looks like Smash Brothers.

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:43.000
So pretty crazy all the stuff that is actually being created for this.

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:51.000
The UNO one, actually, people have spent, I guess, almost 1400 hours playing UNO Overwatch.

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:57.000
And I guess across, you know, they said it looks like 1500 matches.

01:15:57.000 --> 01:16:06.000
And then, of course, the second one floor is lava parkour and McCree Hot Potato, 1246 in 1048 hours.

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:10.000
You know, I've been out of the loop on Overwatch, admittedly. I haven't really played a lot.

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:13.000
But this is definitely going to make me take another look.

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:18.000
And, you know, Blizzard's kind of done this sort of thing before. And, you know, Starcraft 2 was the game that they did.

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:22.000
They had that whole Starcraft 2 arcade. And it was a very similar thing. It was Starcraft Workshop.

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:30.000
And I loved, there was Star Jeweled, where you basically played Bejeweled, but it would cause a Starcraft match to kind of automate.

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:36.000
And they had another one called Iyer Chef, because Iyer is one of the races in Starcraft.

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:40.000
They had one where you had to go out and get ingredients and stuff. And it was fun.

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:46.000
And those two particular games were like official Blizzard arcade products.

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:56.000
And, you know, if you want to talk about modding and arcade stuff, heck, go all the way back to Warcraft 3 and this little mod called Defense of the Ancients, or Dota.

01:16:56.000 --> 01:17:06.000
I mean, that started a whole other, that started the MOBA genre of games for which we have Heroes of the Storm, Dota 2, League of Legends.

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:13.000
You know, that all owes itself to something like this. So, who knows, maybe The Floor is Lava will be a next Valve acquisition.

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:19.000
And then they'll put out the second game, and then never a third game. That'll be the way it goes.

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:23.000
So, I'll check that out. It sounds good. Bobby Blackwolf says, this might get me to Overwatch.

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:33.000
Yeah, why not? I mean, in Overwatch, is it only 20 bucks now? Did they finally permanently put the price down? I don't know, or is it still like 50? I don't know.

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:40.000
Anyway, Act F says, they need to fix some of the stuff in the regular game. Cough, cough, better console support, and so forth.

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:45.000
Dark Tetsuya says, hashtag, The Floor is Lava 3 confirmed.

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:50.000
Bonds006 says, yes, the granddaddies are getting some shine, Dota.

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:56.000
Hey, well, yeah, with Warcraft 3 remastered, let's not forget, that's a Blizzard thing that they're working on.

01:17:56.000 --> 01:18:07.000
So, it'll be interesting to see that original Dota getting remastered. I'm confident Blizzard has to be, like, not only are they thinking about the original Warcraft 3 game, that mod has got to be up and running day one.

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:13.000
They're going to have some type of official Dota mod for that day one, because that'll get people interested in Warcraft 3 right there, I'm sure.

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:21.000
So, anyway, moving on, we kind of referenced this a little bit earlier in the show, and it has to do with Pokemon Go and the Apple Watch.

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:27.000
And so, Dark Soccer, I'm sorry to say, Pokemon Go is dropping Apple Watch support after July 1st.

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:34.000
The reason why is that basically it's not useful anymore, because they built Adventure Sync into the game.

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:39.000
So, Adventure Sync kind of takes your steps and your buddy, Candy, and all that stuff and puts it in the game.

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:46.000
So, they felt that the Watch app was a little bit redundant and not worth them basically putting extra resources into. So, RIP.

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:48.000
Well, I liked it linking to my workouts.

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:51.000
Yeah, but I think Adventure Sync will also link to your workouts.

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:57.000
So, yeah, Adventure Sync will track data through fitness apps, including data sent from the Apple Watch.

01:18:57.000 --> 01:19:03.000
So, that's that. So, basically, the Adventure Sync mode killed the Apple Watch support.

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:13.000
I think it is notable, though, that we're here because I feel like it was just two years ago at Apple's big event where they were talking about this on stage.

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:20.000
And so, now it's gone. And it's not, I mean, it's not like EA pulling online servers after only a year and a half.

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:25.000
I mean, they're pulling this because something a little more advanced replaced it. So, it's not that big a deal.

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:30.000
But it is just interesting how fast the technology moves, right? This is how fast technology moves.

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:37.000
What we were once shouting about on stage is, look at this cool new feature for the game that everybody's playing is now, oh, it's sunsetting because it's redundant.

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:41.000
That's how fast technology is moving. And I thought that made this very noteworthy.

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:47.000
So, from there, we'll take a trip back in time to the classic game of the week.

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:55.000
Every week here on the show, Dark Sakura takes a step back through space and time to find a game that she thinks, hey, you guys should be checking out this game this week.

01:19:55.000 --> 01:20:03.000
But in a 2019 twist, once a month, she spotlights a game as a classic soundtrack of the month.

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:10.000
And just ironically with us being off last week, I believe the last show we had May's soundtrack of the month.

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:15.000
And now today we're getting June's soundtrack of the month. So, lots of soundtracks.

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:18.000
But a good choice tonight. I'm excited to hear more about this.

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:21.000
So, Dark Sakura, what is the classic soundtrack of the month?

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:32.000
The classic soundtrack of the month is actually R-Type for, and I actually picked two consoles for this because I thought, while I do think one is better than the other, the other one is fairly noteworthy for what it is.

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:34.000
We're going to start on Sega Master System.

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:37.000
So, Sega Master System, and this is specifically the FM soundtrack.

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:47.000
R-Type has an amazing soundtrack anyway. Everyone who has ever heard me talk about it knows that R-Type is one of my favorite pieces of music ever.

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:53.000
And I'm going to apologize. The audio is going to be a little low. And here in studio, you're not going to be able to hear it. It is going through on stream. I can see the bars.

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:59.000
But it is a little lower than usual. Sorry, that was just a my bad in the production. But you should be able to hear it if you listen carefully.

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:05.000
Well, at any rate, the music, at least for the arcade game, was done by Ishizaki Masato.

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:11.000
And I don't know if he did the SMS version.

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:16.000
But the Sega Master System version, and I've brought up the FM sound unit before.

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:24.000
With the FM sound unit, what it does is it enhances the sound output from certain of the Sega Mark III games.

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:33.000
It was a separate unit that was sold in Japan starting around 1987 for about 6800 yen.

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:43.000
And it used a YM2413 FM chip that would work on top of the built-in SN76489 PSG chip.

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:46.000
So it added 9 extra mono sound channels.

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:52.000
So of course you could get nearer arcade quality music out of the Sega Master System.

01:21:52.000 --> 01:22:00.000
And it supported a good number of games too, including R-Type.

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:09.000
So the music, and I'll add this on here, you can get an FM power base converter.

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:14.000
If you've got a Sega Master System, that will also give you the FM output for this game.

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:17.000
But it's just super amazing.

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:23.000
And I'm not going to go into the gameplay of R-Type, because I've talked about R-Type ad nauseam.

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:29.000
But the music, I think for the type of game it was, was really unique.

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:34.000
Where you had your Gradius music that was all kind of upbeat and heroic.

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:42.000
You had this dark, gritty music that was mostly all in minor key.

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:45.000
And then when you beat your level, it goes into a major key.

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:48.000
And then goes right back into a minor key.

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:50.000
It really added to the excitement of the game.

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:52.000
Especially those boss battles.

01:22:54.000 --> 01:23:00.000
Now, to add in another one that I was surprisingly happy with.

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:02.000
And you may be pleased with this.

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:05.000
The Commodore 64 version of the music.

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:08.000
And we actually have some B-roll of that.

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:16.000
And I don't think it's as great as the Sega Master System version, clearly.

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:26.000
But the instrumentation on this one with what the Commodore 64 could do was really good.

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:30.000
Yeah, if you were a fan of the SID chip on the 64, this is a really good use of it.

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:33.000
Like, obviously, see now I am more partial to this one.

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:38.000
But that's because I grew up with C64, I love C64 music.

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:42.000
So both Dark Soccer and I have these admitted biases tonight.

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:44.000
Well, and I didn't grow up with the Master System.

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:46.000
Yeah, but you became a Sega fan later, you know.

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:54.000
Yeah, but at any rate, though, I have to say that I had not given this version much thought.

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:58.000
Even though I know, playwise, it's a pretty good version of our type.

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:02.000
It's an impressive fucking feat for the Commodore 64 as well.

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:04.000
I don't think you see it in this early levels.

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:07.000
But in some of the later levels, when the background starts drawing in.

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:09.000
Oh, here we go. There we go.

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:11.000
So on the Twitch stream, you can actually see the background's drawing in.

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:13.000
And it's kind of moving at its own pace.

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:18.000
This is impressive for an early 80s computer.

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:22.000
And this was an 8-bit computer, if I recall, technically.

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:24.000
Yeah, the 64, yeah.

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:28.000
I mean, later on, you had the 128 that tried to up that.

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:31.000
But nothing ever matched the 64.

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:34.000
Right. And so I really, really...

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:37.000
And I was just sitting down listening to the music.

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:40.000
And I was like, damn, this is actually pretty good.

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:45.000
So I figured that I would add this one in as well.

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:52.000
Because it's the same game, but each of them showcase what their systems can do.

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:57.000
And I think because the Commodore 64 had its own chip with its own limitations,

01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:58.000
it was kind of a regular thing.

01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:03.000
This is not the only game that had an independent soundtrack for the Commodore 64 version.

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:06.000
The other big example I think of, which I think I picked as a classic game of the week,

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:08.000
one of the weeks you weren't here, about a year ago,

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:10.000
Bomb Jack is a great example of that.

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:14.000
You know, Bomb Jack had his own little song in the arcade and in some of the translations.

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:20.000
But for the Commodore 64 version, they took an actual 80s synth NeoWave song

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:22.000
and made it on the Commodore 64 version of that.

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:31.000
That whole thing, that was actually an 80s song that they kind of made the Bomb Jack song on 64.

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:32.000
It was really cool.

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:36.000
And for the record, I'm not including the PC Engine version,

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:38.000
which was switched between two HuCards.

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:47.000
Because while it is technically still an 8-bit system, it was the hybrid 8 and 16-bit system.

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:50.000
You're trying to keep your spotlight pure this year.

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:53.000
Yeah. Next, I typically...

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:55.000
This level impressed me that we're looking at on Twitch.

01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:56.000
Right? It looks perfect.

01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:58.000
See how it looks so good with the...

01:25:58.000 --> 01:25:59.000
I mean, and again...

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:01.000
The scrolling in this is amazing.

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:04.000
1982, 1983 technology. You've got the two levels of scrolling.

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:07.000
Well, and look at your other computers that were out at the time.

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:10.000
Like the ZX, which was garbage.

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:13.000
And the Amstrad...

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:14.000
Garbage.

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:16.000
You know, all those versions were pretty shit.

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:23.000
You are dealing with, I think, as close to Arcade Perfect as the Commodore 64 could possibly get.

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:25.000
As a home computer could possibly get.

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:32.000
And then, of course, you know, the Master System was fairly perfect because Sega just had that.

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:33.000
They did great shooters.

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:36.000
Let's flip back to the Master System and kind of end on that note.

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:37.000
Okay.

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:42.000
And I honestly, though, I think this is the closest to Arcade Perfect that you could get at the time.

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:45.000
You know, because you've got multiple layers of parallax and everything.

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:47.000
But it goes back to the music.

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:51.000
Both of them have a stellar version of that arcade soundtrack.

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:53.000
And I am absolutely...

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:57.000
I sat and listened to the Master System soundtrack.

01:26:57.000 --> 01:27:01.000
And then played the soundtrack for the Commodore.

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:03.000
And then played the arcade soundtrack.

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:08.000
I listened to the R-Type soundtracks three different times.

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:11.000
Preparing for this because I fucking love the music in R-Type so much.

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:13.000
The first level music is my favorite.

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:15.000
It's probably up there for my favorite.

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:18.000
It's up there with Fantasy Zone for some of my favorite first level music.

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:21.000
So, R-Type, bitches.

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:23.000
Alright, there it is, your classic soundtrack of the month.

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:25.000
R-Type for the Sega Master System.

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:27.000
But a little garnish of the Commodore version as well.

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:30.000
And I was going to mention, if you love R-Type, guess what?

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:34.000
The R-Type Final 2 Kickstarter is kicking off on June 3rd.

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:35.000
What?

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:36.000
Take all my money.

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:40.000
I don't know, though. R-Type Delta kind of screwed me over.

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:42.000
R-Type Final 2 dot com.

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:45.000
Alright, awesome.

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:48.000
There it is, your classic soundtrack of the month.

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:51.000
You know, speaking of soundtracks, one thing I've got to caution.

01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:54.000
So, I was listening to a gaming soundtrack as I was driving home last night.

01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:58.000
I was in San Jose for the day for yet another Ingers thing.

01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:02.000
But I also find really good ways to make these Ingers things about also visiting people.

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:06.000
So, I also visited Mel and some of my other friends over there in San Jose.

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:17.000
But as I was driving home, I made the mistake of listening to the Wan-gan Midnight Maximum Tune 5 soundtrack by Yuzo Koshiro because it's on Spotify.

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:19.000
They didn't have the older ones, or at least I couldn't find them.

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:21.000
But five was there. I was like, oh, I haven't heard five yet.

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:23.000
And I started listening to that as I was driving home.

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:25.000
Bad idea.

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:27.000
Because I'm night driving to those soundtracks.

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:29.000
Guess how fast I was going down the freeway?

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:30.000
In my little Prius.

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:31.000
Ninety.

01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:32.000
Eighty-eight.

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:34.000
Which for a Prius, it's pretty fast.

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:39.000
So when that Prius hits eighty-eight miles an hour, you're gonna see some shit.

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:40.000
It catches on fire.

01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:44.000
Yeah, right. So, I had to actually stop myself and go, I wasn't doing it for very long.

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:47.000
You know, I was like jamming along, jamming along.

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:50.000
And then I looked at the speedometer and I was like, slow down.

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:52.000
So, anyway.

01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:58.000
YYR in chat says, hell yeah. Wan-gan Midnight Maximum Tune soundtrack is the real deal.

01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:01.000
Remember that drive we made to Disneyland?

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:04.000
Oh my god. On the I-5 going to L.A.

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:05.000
When I was being a little shit.

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:07.000
You could do like a hundred and get away with it.

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:11.000
Well, but that was me driving my Lancer. Remember the Lancer?

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:12.000
Oh yeah, I do.

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:13.000
The little silver demon.

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:14.000
I do.

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:16.000
Listening to Wan-gan and DDR stuff.

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:20.000
I remember one time I drove your car because, and somebody else was with us.

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:24.000
Like it was, I want to say it was like, it was like Wendell or something was with us.

01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:27.000
I feel like we were, because we went, or was it Shane? No, it was Shane.

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:28.000
It was Shane.

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:30.000
Because, but I thought it went up because it was like a DDR.

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:32.000
It was a DDR related thing we were doing.

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:37.000
We went from the Bay Area all the way down 101 because there was snow on the grapevine.

01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:42.000
That was right. We were going, was it Disneyland? It was a Disneyland trip.

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:44.000
I thought it was a DDR related thing. Why did I?

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:45.000
I thought it was a Disneyland trip.

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:46.000
Appreciate DDR people.

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:47.000
Are you going to Arcade Infinity?

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:49.000
It might have been Arcade Infinity trip or something.

01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:51.000
And it wasn't, we weren't there for the closing of Arcade Infinity.

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:52.000
No.

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:54.000
But I thought for sure we were there for a Disneyland thing.

01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:57.000
Because we cannot go to L.A. without Disneyland.

01:29:57.000 --> 01:30:00.000
Well, especially during that, now it's too expensive. I can't do it anymore.

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:01.000
Yeah.

01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:06.000
But at that time when Disneyland was more affordable, like, it was just funny to say, Disneyland used to be affordable.

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:11.000
I mean, it was always luxury, but, you know, this was before Cars Land, before all the remodels.

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:14.000
This is when California Avenger was actually California themed.

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:16.000
Yeah, yeah, anyway.

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:19.000
Alright, anyway, let's take a break. We're going to take a break here in studio.

01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:25.000
But we have a little prerecorded segment for you guys that has to do with, funny enough,

01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:28.000
DarkSakura brought up the ZX Spectrum from overseas.

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:31.000
She was not a fan of the system, and I will admit.

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:32.000
But I want one.

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:36.000
Compared to the Commodore 64, it wasn't that great, but it was a big deal in Europe.

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:41.000
And if you haven't played a lot of ZX Spectrum games, there is a new service out there that allows you to play,

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:44.000
not just those games, but some Commodore games as well, and Neo Geo games.

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:48.000
It's a service called Anstream, and it's in early access right now.

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:52.000
And I'm a Kickstarter backer and had access to the early access.

01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:56.000
So I thought we could take a look at Anstream tonight. So let's get to it.

01:30:57.000 --> 01:31:01.000
Okay, so for our studio break this week, I thought we could take a look at Anstream.

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:04.000
We've been talking about it the past couple weeks on the show,

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:08.000
as their Kickstarter campaign had kind of kicked off and then subsequently wrapped up.

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:15.000
And for those that don't remember, Anstream is that kind of like retro Netflix, if you will,

01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:19.000
that's available on a variety of platforms, including PC, which is what we're looking at tonight,

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:22.000
as well as Xbox One. I know there's some Android-related devices.

01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:26.000
I think they plan to come out on PlayStation 4 as well. There's a lot. There's plenty.

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:31.000
More is available on their site, and they have a variety of older games that are available on the service.

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:35.000
Right now, I think there's around 200. I know they have a game list online.

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:39.000
And you can see here as we're actually in the client, and I can kind of poke around here and actually show you.

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:42.000
Okay, yeah, there's all these different categories that are available,

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:47.000
which is interesting because the categories seem to be a little bit random, kind of like what Netflix does.

01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:51.000
If you've used Netflix before, it'll show you these very kind of obscure categories sometimes.

01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:54.000
Not that I would call a category like Spectrum Games obscure,

01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:59.000
but it does seem like the client right now kind of mixes up the different types of games that you will see.

01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:04.000
Now, it should be stressed that what we're looking at right now is early access.

01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:07.000
This is a very early version of Anstream.

01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:10.000
It's only available to Kickstarter backers of a certain level,

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:14.000
which obviously since I'm in here, disclosure, I'm one of those backers.

01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:17.000
But I was always, and I've mentioned this on the show,

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:21.000
I was kind of excited that somebody has kind of taken the idea of retro gaming

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:25.000
with leaderboards and things of that nature and these challenges,

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:27.000
which I'll get into in a minute,

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:31.000
kind of reminded me a little bit of what GameTap used to be a long time ago.

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:37.000
The other interesting thing about Anstream is that it's kind of like Google Stadia, I guess if you will,

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:39.000
where you're not actually downloading the ROMs.

01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:44.000
You're actually kind of streaming this instance running on another computer up in the cloud,

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:47.000
somewhere at Anstream headquarters or wherever their server farm is.

01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:51.000
But unlike Stadia, which is meant to play state-of-the-art games,

01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:53.000
because we're looking at retro games here,

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:58.000
we're not really talking about the same type of bandwidth requirements and things of that nature.

01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:00.000
So let me actually get in here and play a game already.

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:05.000
You can either find a game on the list, so maybe I can go down to something I recently played.

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:07.000
Oh, we can take a look at Monty on the Run.

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:10.000
For a lot of people, this is really obscure.

01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:16.000
This is a Commodore 64 game, but you'll notice it's in my list twice because they have it on Commodore 64 and Spectrum.

01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:20.000
But this game had a real kick-ass soundtrack, which is one of the reasons why I like it.

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:23.000
So you will notice it does take a little bit to load,

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:30.000
and I wonder if potentially the Google outages that happened today in the news are maybe affecting this a little bit.

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:31.000
I don't know.

01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:34.000
But you'll notice when you launch the game, you also get an overview of what the GamePad does.

01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:41.000
I am using a 360 controller, so they did take a lot of the old keyboard games from Commodore 64,

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:47.000
or games that had single fire buttons or maybe perhaps used complex layouts on the keyboard,

01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:50.000
and kind of made them work and went in and made them all work with GamePads and stuff.

01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:52.000
So let's actually get in there and play.

01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:58.000
Again, these are older games, so they're not going to look like newer stuff,

01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:03.000
but without these classic older games, we wouldn't have the same stuff that we have today.

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:06.000
So this is a very simple game.

01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:10.000
It's like a platformer, but you have a jump button, and you move around.

01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:15.000
And you'll notice it does look pretty good, especially because it is an older game.

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:17.000
It probably doesn't need that same type...

01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:19.000
Oh, that's a thing that...

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:22.000
Oh, no, I got smooshed.

01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:27.000
Because it is an older game, it doesn't have the complex colors...

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:30.000
Let me move my mouse cursor out of the way.

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:35.000
You'll notice it still has that sweet soundtrack like it had back in the day.

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:40.000
I'm not very good at this game. I used to be better at this when I was a kid.

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:46.000
Boy, those plungers make a pretty hideous noise, don't they?

01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:48.000
Let's see if I can...

01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:52.000
Alright, clearly I'm terrible at this, but that's alright, you get the idea.

01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:57.000
And it does have a pretty sweet soundtrack when you don't have all those plunger noises in the background competing for that.

01:34:57.000 --> 01:34:59.000
But that's a little bit about what that looks like.

01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:02.000
So let me actually pick a different game this time.

01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:06.000
So we're going to quit out, and this time we're going to go in and...

01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:08.000
Let's take a look at maybe something a little newer.

01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:12.000
Oh, like Fatal Fury, right?

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:15.000
So there's a few SNK Neo Geo games that are available in here.

01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:17.000
Let's take a look at this. Let's load this one up.

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:21.000
Uh-oh. See, early access. These things are going to happen.

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:23.000
I'm not going to worry too much about that.

01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:25.000
Again, and also there's those internet outages happening today.

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:29.000
So I just kind of work around these error messages. They haven't killed my experience yet.

01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:31.000
Okay, so there we go.

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:36.000
So we have a little overview of how we can insert credits and start and all that.

01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:38.000
And then... Ah, yes.

01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:43.000
And you know, being that this is a newer Neo Geo game, and some of these games...

01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:49.000
And I don't even think this is going to come through on the video that you guys are looking at on OLR.

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:55.000
But you might see when you do the fade in and fade out, you have a little bit of artifacting.

01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:58.000
And you might be able to see that as well, like as the characters move.

01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:01.000
And you can kind of see it just a little bit up in the clouds.

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:05.000
So you do get a little bit of artifacting, but it's really not that bad.

01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:09.000
And again, say as disclaimer a million times, early access.

01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:14.000
Antstream very much appears to be a company that's based over in Europe.

01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:18.000
So I imagine, you know, a lot of their early access stuff may actually be overseas.

01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:22.000
I don't know how much they have over here in the U.S. actually streaming.

01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:26.000
But otherwise, you know, it's kind of the game that you remember, Fatal Fury.

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:29.000
Of course, in the first Fatal Fury game, you could only pick one of three characters.

01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:31.000
You can pick everybody.

01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:33.000
But I seem to remember Andy Bogard is pretty awesome.

01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:37.000
Let's see, and then I can pick who I want to fight, which obviously I want to fight Duck King.

01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:41.000
So let's see.

01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:45.000
The sound comes through pretty good.

01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:51.000
Oh, I see some of that artifacting pretty bad in that transition there.

01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:54.000
Wow, and I am not as good at this game as I used to be.

01:36:57.000 --> 01:37:03.000
Wow, I should have just named this segment Watch Rob Be Bad at Old Games, because that's exactly what's happening today.

01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:06.000
Antstream keeping me humble in 2019.

01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:09.000
Let's see if I can at least win one round.

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:13.000
I also can't remember how to do Andy's special moves. It's been a little while.

01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:19.000
Was it Back Forward Charge? Back Forward A?

01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:25.000
Well, this is going swimmingly.

01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:28.000
There's a guy laughing at me full-on in the background there.

01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:30.000
Ugh, barf.

01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:34.000
You know, that's about how well it went for me on a Neo Geo arcade machine, too, to be fair.

01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:40.000
All right, one other thing I want to show with these, which I think is pretty cool, something that they have built into Antstream that I think is kind of unique.

01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:42.000
Let me quit out here.

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:47.000
So you'll notice that in Antstream I have these little gems up here at the top.

01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:52.000
So you can use these gems. They're not, and it's not, and they're very explicit to point this out,

01:37:52.000 --> 01:38:00.000
gems are not like some type of premium currency that you're paying additional money on top of the anticipated monthly fee to have.

01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:04.000
You actually earn these gems through different challenges that are in the game.

01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:10.000
So if I actually go back, and there's a whole section that actually has challenges, Fatal Fury is one of them, but that didn't go so well for me.

01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:13.000
Let me try something else. Ooh, how about Super Dodgeball? Come on, this game was awesome.

01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:18.000
Not that I'm going to do very well at this either, but we can go in here, and you'll notice there are some challenges in here.

01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:23.000
So there's a challenge to be like the last man standing. It says survive as long as possible with one team member.

01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:29.000
You'll notice that's rated like a one, and then we go up to like a level two. Take out the opposing team as fast as possible.

01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:35.000
And then you can go up a little harder as well, so knock down as many of the opposing team as you can before any of your team gets taken out,

01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:42.000
and then you can pay 50 gems to unlock that. So the gems are kind of a currency that's used to progress within the challenge system, which is kind of neat.

01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:46.000
So to show you what a challenge might look like, let's bring up this last man standing.

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:53.000
And you'll notice I could challenge a friend. The social stuff, again, since we are in early access, the social stuff doesn't seem to be built out yet,

01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:58.000
so I can't throw Bobby Black Wolf a challenge for him to ignore or anything like that just yet,

01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:05.000
and that's going to come in some of the updates up over the next month or so until I think they plan to launch full over the summer.

01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:08.000
Don't quote me on that, but that's probably their plan.

01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:15.000
So let's play this one solo, and okay, so pass dodge is B on the Xbox controller, throw catch is play.

01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:19.000
You'll notice about the challenge, it's going to just kind of start me off right in there, which is kind of neat.

01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:22.000
So, all right, three, two, one, go.

01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:26.000
So, all right.

01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:28.000
Not to get down. I got to be careful.

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:32.000
I don't want to get killed. Oh, no.

01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:37.000
Okay, pant, pant, pant, pick up the ball. Let's go.

01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:44.000
I just oops, I meant to jump and I just passed the ball.

01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:48.000
I got a guy on the side. It's been way too long. Okay, double tap is how you run.

01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:53.000
I knew there's a way to do it.

01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:58.000
I need to quit throwing the ball at them. Come on. There we go.

01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:01.000
You get.

01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:04.000
Oh, no, I died. All right. Oh, no, I'm not dead.

01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:07.000
Okay. I just flashed from it. I thought that was it.

01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:12.000
Okay. All right. All right. We're almost up to surviving a whole minute.

01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:16.000
Oh.

01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:24.000
All right. At least this is going better than the last one. All right. Let's see if I can.

01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:26.000
Here we go. Got one of the little guys.

01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:29.000
I heard the little splat. All right.

01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:35.000
So, I lasted a little over a minute, but you'll notice it all kind of triggered within there.

01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:40.000
I got it. Okay. So, I got 69 seconds and that was enough for me to get a bronze medal.

01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:46.000
And I got 50 XP. So, I'm getting closer to leveling up my little character, my online persona, I guess.

01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:49.000
And I got a few gems for that. So, that's pretty cool.

01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:56.000
And then you can actually see like, you know, okay, so I got a bronze and let's see, I could retry if I want.

01:40:56.000 --> 01:41:00.000
And I think, yeah, it shows you, okay, if I wanted to get a silver medal, I needed to go for 75 seconds.

01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:03.000
And then I think you can actually look at the scores. I'm not sure how well this is implemented yet.

01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:08.000
Okay, so these are real people, I'm pretty sure. So, you can see, I think this is like a high score leaderboard.

01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:11.000
And then you can also look at, you know, similar games and things like that.

01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:18.000
So, anyway, I think, you know, I showed you the challenges, I showed you like an older game on the Commodore 64 and how that looks.

01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:21.000
I showed you a newer game on the Neo Geo and how that looks.

01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:25.000
So, and stream is progressing along very nicely.

01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:32.000
You know, I'm hoping in a couple months when they've had a little more time to work on it and get some of the feedback for some of their testing,

01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:37.000
maybe some of those things like the slight artifacting we were seeing in some of the newer games, maybe that'll be addressed a little bit.

01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:40.000
Although I think it still looks, you know, it's certainly playable.

01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:45.000
And then maybe some of the like game discoverability features and the social features will be built in.

01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:48.000
But so far, so good. I'm enjoying this.

01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:54.000
I think, you know, again, some of these extra things that are built into it, like the challenges, leaderboards and things like that,

01:41:54.000 --> 01:42:01.000
make it a little more than just, you know, oh, we're just unloading all these games on you, dumping all these games on you for a monthly fee.

01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:06.000
I like that they're kind of taking it a step further and maybe making something a little more social about it.

01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:13.000
Because we here at Orange Lodge Radio, we love our old games and it's something we can be very social and talk about a lot.

01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:16.000
So on that note, we're going to take it back to the studio live.

01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:25.000
Welcome back, everybody. Live here on June the 2nd of 2019 with episode 778 of our show.

01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:29.000
And thank you, me, for that little prerecorded segment on and stream.

01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:32.000
And that was your first time. I know, Jamie, you ran out.

01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:35.000
You probably didn't see all that, but you saw some of that. What did you think?

01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:36.000
Looks neat.

01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:37.000
Yeah, it's kind of neat, right?

01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:38.000
Yeah.

01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:45.000
What's funny, I'm looking at some of the comments in chat. YYR says the combat tribes, the combat tribes or whatever you say, is not similar to Super Dodgeball.

01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:51.000
I'm pretty sure they're using some type of algorithm and it's probably like, oh, people were checking out this Neo Geo games.

01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:52.000
They were also playing this other.

01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:55.000
Or maybe just like genre and system or something like that.

01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:57.000
I think a lot of it is still being refined.

01:42:57.000 --> 01:43:02.000
Again, I chalk a lot of the issues up to just the early access umbrella, but I like what I see so far.

01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:08.000
And I think it's also very cool that that, you know, I was playing it on PC, but they are it's on Xbox one right now as well.

01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:12.000
It's on Android, I think, because early Apple's a little harder with early access.

01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:14.000
I think they plan to be there, but they're not there right now.

01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:17.000
And then they're on or they will be on PlayStation four.

01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:19.000
I think was one of their stretch goals.

01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:20.000
So it's kind of neat.

01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:26.000
And I guess, you know, if you have like progress or, you know, the gems, it carries with you from place to place.

01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:27.000
That's kind of neat.

01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:30.000
So anyway, we'll be keeping an eye on Antstream as it develops.

01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:34.000
I have at least a year paid for, so I'll be having it for a while.

01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:37.000
But it's a great way to experience the old Commodore 64.

01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:40.000
Does your year start now or does it start when the service actually launches?

01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:43.000
Funny enough, somebody asked that on the Discord recently.

01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:48.000
And they say it looks like it starts now because that's how we had to enable all your accounts.

01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:52.000
But when we officially launch, we'll reset the clock as of the day of the official launch.

01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:53.000
So that's pretty cool.

01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:57.000
Yeah, I think I actually ponied up for two years.

01:43:57.000 --> 01:44:02.000
So I'm a very much a big backer of Antstream.

01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:04.000
And you guys told me about this too.

01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:09.000
I had no idea this was a thing until somebody at Orange Launch Radio brought it to my attention.

01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:11.000
And that was via our Discord server.

01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:14.000
So thank you to the folks over at our Discord.

01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:17.000
vognetwork.com or vognetwork.com slash Discord.

01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:21.000
And you can join and you can tell me these things I should be paying attention to.

01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:27.000
I had not given to a Kickstarter in a very long time until I gave to this one.

01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:33.000
But I felt this one, they were kind of showing that they already had kind of a lot of the infrastructure there.

01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:38.000
This was just to kind of push them out of the gate for launch and kind of help propel them there.

01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:39.000
And that's why I did it.

01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:43.000
I wasn't worried about losing money or having to wait years and years and years.

01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:49.000
I mean, hello, I was a Kickstarter backer for Bloodstained like five years ago.

01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:55.000
Look, take the time to get it right. I get it, but it's a long time.

01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:57.000
Hope it is right when it comes out.

01:44:57.000 --> 01:44:59.000
Hope it's okay.

01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:03.000
Anyway, Bobby says they are very receptive to feedback.

01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:05.000
They seem like good people.

01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:09.000
Yeah, they have their own Discord and they've been very active on there.

01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:12.000
The people that are developing it as well as their community manager.

01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:18.000
And because it's based over in Europe, they had a whole channel dedicated to Eurovision.

01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:19.000
Which I can appreciate.

01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:21.000
So, I thought it was really cool.

01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:22.000
Anyway, let's move on with the show.

01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:25.000
We've got more stuff to talk about, including some rapid fire news.

01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:26.000
So, let's get to it.

01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:29.000
Let's talk about those free games that you get with those paid subscriptions.

01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:33.000
So, starting with the Xbox side of the house.

01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:36.000
June's games with gold.

01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:40.000
On Xbox one you're going to be getting EA Sports NHL 19.

01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:42.000
That's for the entire month of June.

01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:46.000
And then starting at the halfway point, Rivals of the Aether.

01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:49.000
That's going to be from June 16th through the 15th.

01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:54.000
Your Xbox 360 compatible games with Xbox one.

01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:58.000
Portal's still alive for the first half of June from the 1st to the 15th.

01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:04.000
And this is awesome because it's your second month in a row that you get another Earth Defense Force title.

01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:10.000
So, Earth Defense Force 2017, which is definitely better than Insect Armageddon.

01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:13.000
Maybe not technically better, but it is a better game.

01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:16.000
That'll be from June 16th through the 30th.

01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:23.000
And of course, on the Sony side of the house, PlayStation Plus, you're going to be getting Sonic Mania.

01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:27.000
And Borderlands The Handsome Collection for the month of June.

01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:34.000
And then, we've got some other Sony games, or previously Sony games.

01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:40.000
So, you know, there's been some of these exclusives that have been released on the Epic Games Store.

01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:47.000
Well, now, that game company's journey is going to be heading to PC, exclusive to the Epic Games Store on June 6th.

01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:50.000
So, if you want to check that on PC, I'm sure that'll look amazing.

01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:56.000
Interesting that that particular title went exclusive to Epic Store.

01:46:56.000 --> 01:46:59.000
I think they have Flower on there already.

01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:01.000
I guess, I think you're right. I think you are right.

01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:03.000
So, it's kind of interesting.

01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:08.000
So, anyway, moving on with some other news about games coming to other places.

01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:16.000
Timespinner, that is a Metroidvania type of game that was pretty well received when it came out on the PlayStation 4 and PC.

01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:20.000
Well, guess what? It's also coming out on the Switch and the Xbox One.

01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:27.000
So, this game came out last year, but now the Xbox One and the Switch get their crack at it on June 4th.

01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:31.000
And obviously, with the Switch version, it'll be a way for you to take it with you on the go wherever you want.

01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:36.000
Doesn't sound like there's any new exclusive content or anything like that, but still pretty cool.

01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:41.000
And by the way, if you weren't already aware, we interviewed the developer of Timespinner on Orange Ontario.

01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:44.000
And thank you, Darktosuya dug up the episode number 571.

01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:47.000
So, if you want to go back in the archives to episode 571, we actually...

01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:50.000
And this was long before the game was out when it was still in development.

01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:52.000
So, it was kind of fun to talk to them then.

01:47:54.000 --> 01:48:00.000
Also, in rapid fire news tonight, talking about a new type of main cabinet.

01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:03.000
Kind of in line with those, like, arcade one-up machines.

01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:08.000
I was in a Fry's randomly this weekend, and they have a bunch of them on display there.

01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:12.000
I think Walmarts, some of them show, like, they put it in a glass case,

01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:16.000
because kids at Walmart will beat the shit out of those things, I'm sure.

01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:19.000
But I think they put it in a big glass case, so you can kind of see it.

01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:22.000
But the ones at Fry's, you can just kind of walk up and play, they look pretty good.

01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:27.000
Well, this seems to be another... It's not an arcade one-up, it's just similar to that.

01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:30.000
Think of that. It's called the Legends Ultimate.

01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:34.000
It is an all-in-one cabinet, and it's supposed to be starting in July.

01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:39.000
$599 for a full-sized 66-inch cabinet,

01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:44.000
or $399 for a compact 44-inch version of the cabinet.

01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:47.000
But this game is supposed to have between, this is a big window,

01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:50.000
but 200 to 400 included games.

01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:53.000
350 are kind of shown on artwork.

01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:57.000
I will say one of those games is Tron, so you know that got my attention.

01:48:57.000 --> 01:49:02.000
If you want to show 350 games, a good way to get something to jump out at me is to include Tron.

01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:04.000
They also had Fix-It Felix Jr.

01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:06.000
I thought that was interesting. Fix-It Felix is one of the games.

01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:10.000
So is that like by the same company it does those little mini-arcade things in,

01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:12.000
because didn't they get the...

01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:15.000
I don't think they had the exclusive rights to that, though.

01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:18.000
Was that like a meme ROM that they made?

01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:20.000
You're talking about, you know what, it's funny, and I can put this on,

01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:22.000
keep talking, because I have one of these.

01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:25.000
Yeah, I remember them making the mini cabinet for that,

01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:30.000
so I was just wondering if it's the same company that's behind that that's doing this larger one.

01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:33.000
I mean, it seems like the natural progression of things.

01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:36.000
I don't think so.

01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:38.000
It's probably the same ROM, though.

01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:41.000
That's the one that's been going around for a few things.

01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:43.000
I think the one at Disneyland was the same one.

01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:45.000
That one is by a company called Basic Fun,

01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:48.000
and this machine is being put together by a company called AtGames.

01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:53.000
But I still think that it's still compiling off the same ROM data.

01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:55.000
Well, probably, I'm sure.

01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:58.000
They'd probably just pay a licensing fee to the company that made it and go from there.

01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:03.000
But anyway, just kind of interesting how I guess these arcade 1UP cabinets are doing well enough

01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:06.000
where other kind of competitors are getting in the business.

01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:10.000
I'm sure for people's home game rooms and for parties and things like that,

01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:13.000
I went to a wedding that had a little mini Street Fighter II cabinet

01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:18.000
because it was two nerds getting married, and the wedding party loved it.

01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:20.000
So I think they're fun for those types of events.

01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:23.000
I'm sure we'll see more like this.

01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:25.000
It's just funny that we have one that's all in one,

01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:29.000
whereas a lot of these arcade 1UP machines have been one, two, or three games.

01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:34.000
Kind of like the Mortal Kombat one I've had my eye on is Mortal Kombat 1, 2, and 3.

01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:36.000
Anyway, DarkSakura, what do you have for us?

01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:38.000
Oh, some stuff.

01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:41.000
Detective Pikachu is coming out on the Switch.

01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:47.000
It is, I think, the same one that was on the 3DS, just touched up.

01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:49.000
So look for it.

01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:54.000
And then for other people who like D&D titles,

01:50:54.000 --> 01:51:01.000
we are getting enhanced versions of Baldur's Gate, Baldur's Gate II,

01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:05.000
Baldur's Gate Siege of Dragonspear, Icewind Dale, Planescape Torment,

01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:11.000
and Neverwinter Nights for PS4, Xbox One, and Switch in the fall.

01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:15.000
Looks like that in North America,

01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:18.000
the physical editions of the Neverwinter Nights enhanced edition

01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:22.000
will come out on December 3rd and December 6th elsewhere in the world,

01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:25.000
while all the other ones are coming out September 24th in North America

01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:29.000
and September 27th elsewhere for 50 bucks a pop.

01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:34.000
That's a big unleashing of the D&D games all at once, but that's pretty cool.

01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:37.000
I'm actually really wanting to play Planescape Torment

01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:40.000
because I haven't played that in an age.

01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:42.000
I'm a big fan of the Planescape world.

01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:46.000
Funny enough, you just spotlighted an old, old D&D game as Classic Game of the Week,

01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:48.000
not that long, less than a month ago.

01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:52.000
Yeah, I think I did...

01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:55.000
I didn't do Ruins of Mythdrine or I did one of the other ones in that series.

01:51:55.000 --> 01:51:57.000
You did the one that was also on NES, I remember that.

01:51:57.000 --> 01:51:58.000
Yeah.

01:51:58.000 --> 01:52:01.000
All right, cool, so that's our rapid-fire news tonight.

01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:03.000
Let's move on to some world release dates

01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:06.000
and talk about some games that are coming out around the world,

01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:08.000
and then we'll get to the mailbag if we have anything.

01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:09.000
I'm not sure we do.

01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:10.000
We have a little bit.

01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:12.000
Just a little bit. All right, so first off, the world release dates.

01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:14.000
Not a lot of things coming out this week.

01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:18.000
We've got Kododama, The Heaven Mysteries of Fujisawa.

01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:23.000
That's coming out on PC, Nintendo Switch, and PlayStation 4.

01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:27.000
Persona Q2, The New Cinema Labyrinth on 3DS.

01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:33.000
The Legend of Heroes, Trails of Cold Steel 2 on the PlayStation 4.

01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:38.000
Warhammer, Chaosbane on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:41.000
Slay the Spire on Nintendo Switch.

01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:44.000
And finally, Octopath Traveler on PC.

01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:47.000
Oh yeah, that's a lot of people excited to play that

01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:50.000
until they heard it was a full-price game still,

01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:53.000
but I don't know, I think it'll still be worth it for many people.

01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:56.000
Traveling over to Japan, checking out the releases on the PlayStation 4 this week.

01:52:56.000 --> 01:52:59.000
It's a little bit lighter, probably with E3 on the horizon

01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:02.000
and the summer and all that, but we still have a few things this week,

01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:06.000
including Rage 2 gets its Japanese release this week on June the 6th,

01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:10.000
and then on June the 7th, New Mina No Golf VR,

01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:13.000
so a golfing VR game is out on the PlayStation 4 this week.

01:53:13.000 --> 01:53:19.000
Heading over to the Switch, on the Switch this week is nothing.

01:53:19.000 --> 01:53:23.000
They get a price reduction on FIFA 19, but that's it.

01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:25.000
The Switch is otherwise quiet.

01:53:25.000 --> 01:53:27.000
There's a Doraemon game next week, but that's about it.

01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:29.000
So, a relatively quiet week in Japan.

01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:31.000
Dara Sakura, how about the UK?

01:53:31.000 --> 01:53:34.000
We have, on the third three different games,

01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:37.000
we have Elder Scrolls Online, Elsewhere.

01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:41.000
We have Persona Q2 New Cinema Labyrinth,

01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:43.000
and Warhammer Chaosbane.

01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:46.000
On the fifth, we have MotoGP 19.

01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:50.000
On the sixth, we have Home Sweet Home for PlayStation,

01:53:50.000 --> 01:53:56.000
and we have The Legend of Heroes Trails of Cold Steel 2 for PlayStation.

01:53:56.000 --> 01:53:59.000
All right, let's get to the mailbag.

01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:01.000
Every week, you guys send us emails.

01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:05.000
Participate at orangelauntrader.com is the place to send your emails,

01:54:05.000 --> 01:54:08.000
and we like to read some of our favorite emails here on the show.

01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:10.000
So, Dark Sakura, I don't know how many we have tonight.

01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:11.000
One.

01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:12.000
Just one, okay.

01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:14.000
That wasn't spam.

01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:17.000
It has been quite a while since I participated in the show.

01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:20.000
I am much older than I was when I started listening to OLR,

01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:24.000
so Sunday Night Live shows are too late for old me to stay up for

01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:26.000
and go to work Mondays.

01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:30.000
You have to remember, the East Coasters, it's three hours ahead over there.

01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:33.000
The show goes till midnight on the East Coast, so it's a little harder for them.

01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:36.000
I admit I have no question or reason to write in.

01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:38.000
I just wanted to say thank you.

01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:41.000
I've communicated with each of you outside the show for various reasons.

01:54:41.000 --> 01:54:44.000
You are just real people at the end of it all.

01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:48.000
My life has bounced back for the horrible year of 2013.

01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:52.000
This is good.

01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:55.000
I remarried, have been enjoying the little things like travel

01:54:55.000 --> 01:54:57.000
and spending time at camp on weekends.

01:54:57.000 --> 01:55:02.000
My daughter graduated college two years ago and is getting married this November.

01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:06.000
I won't say how old she was when I started listening, but you get the idea.

01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:09.000
I can't say thank you enough for everything you do.

01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:11.000
One day I would like to meet you all in person.

01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:13.000
Have a great show.

01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:14.000
And that's Name and Lights.

01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:15.000
You're so welcome. Thank you.

01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:17.000
I knew who this was the minute you said it.

01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:20.000
I think of his real name because I get the Facebook messages.

01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:22.000
Yeah, I remember the real name more than the...

01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:24.000
Yeah, exactly. I remember the real name more than I do the online.

01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:26.000
So I had to think about it. I was like, oh, yeah.

01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:28.000
Yeah, yeah. The minute he talked about his bad year, I knew who that was.

01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:32.000
Yeah, I remember just talking with him when all of that went down.

01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:33.000
It was just so terrible.

01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:38.000
Well, thank you so much for being here with us through the thick and the thin.

01:55:38.000 --> 01:55:41.000
And glad to hear things are a lot better for you now. It's great.

01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:45.000
I think all of us, and we've talked about it here on OLR, we've all had rough years.

01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:47.000
We've all had low points.

01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:49.000
And you're right, we are real people.

01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:54.000
We play as many games as we can between our day jobs and all that.

01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:56.000
But at the end of the day, we're real people.

01:55:56.000 --> 01:56:00.000
And we're so happy that you guys come out here and participate with our show.

01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:04.000
And kind of join us on these Sunday evenings.

01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:09.000
Rob, is that a still shrink-wrapped DDR Extreme 2 for PS2?

01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:13.000
Yes. Why?

01:56:13.000 --> 01:56:15.000
I just looked over and I wasn't expecting to see it.

01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:19.000
There's also a shrink-wrapped version of Karate Revolution Country over there.

01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:22.000
Well, you could guess why that's still shrink-wrapped.

01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:24.000
Because it's garbage, but yeah.

01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:26.000
Here's the thing.

01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:34.000
Somebody got me that because they were giving it as a promo or something.

01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:35.000
That might have been me.

01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:37.000
It might have been. I think it might have been.

01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:39.000
He was like, Rob likes DDR. He'd like that.

01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:43.000
But by that time, my PlayStation 2 was already up and away in favor of my PlayStation 3.

01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:45.000
Which wasn't backwards compatible.

01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:48.000
So yeah, I still have that kind of relic there.

01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:50.000
But you know what?

01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:53.000
Somebody's going to want that dance pad that's in there because it's going to work great.

01:56:54.000 --> 01:56:58.000
I still have two Xbox 360 dance pads.

01:56:58.000 --> 01:57:02.000
Yeah, and the chats are like, what the hell, it's still sealed?

01:57:02.000 --> 01:57:03.000
Yeah, that's still sealed.

01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:05.000
And yeah, the karaoke revolution country.

01:57:05.000 --> 01:57:06.000
That one has a microphone in it.

01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:08.000
But let's be real. We all know why I never opened that.

01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:11.000
You don't like singing the country?

01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:12.000
I don't know.

01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:14.000
Oh, my ex is living in Texas.

01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:16.000
Is this Shania Twain?

01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:18.000
That don't impress me much.

01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:19.000
That's all I know.

01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:22.000
I only know old country.

01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:24.000
We don't play.

01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:26.000
Oh, and Fancy. Does it have Reba Fancy?

01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:28.000
Dude, if it's got Reba, that's worth playing.

01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:29.000
That's true.

01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:31.000
Well, now we have to find out.

01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:37.000
I'm opening that shit right now if it's got Reba.

01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:39.000
Does it have Randy Travis on there?

01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:43.000
I don't know the actual artists on these because it just has the names.

01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:44.000
But let's see here.

01:57:44.000 --> 01:57:46.000
Fancy. Is Fancy there?

01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:47.000
Better have Fancy.

01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:49.000
That's the only reason to own that game.

01:57:49.000 --> 01:57:51.000
Is Dolly considered country enough?

01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:53.000
Yeah, Dolly's still country.

01:57:53.000 --> 01:57:55.000
Code of Many Colors, 9 to 5?

01:57:55.000 --> 01:57:58.000
Or, uh, Jolene?

01:57:58.000 --> 01:57:59.000
Oh, Jolene.

01:57:59.000 --> 01:58:00.000
I would sing Jolene.

01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:04.000
Yeah, I think this is just like kind of the top 40 crap.

01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:06.000
What was cool then?

01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:08.000
9 to 5 is like the first song on the list.

01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:09.000
So it's got Dolly.

01:58:09.000 --> 01:58:11.000
So there is that. Let's see.

01:58:11.000 --> 01:58:13.000
It's, uh, Chattahoochee?

01:58:13.000 --> 01:58:15.000
I know Chattahoochee.

01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:16.000
I know that song, too.

01:58:16.000 --> 01:58:18.000
That was when I was still having to go to Dothan for the summer

01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:20.000
and being subjected to all that.

01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:21.000
Friends in Low Places.

01:58:21.000 --> 01:58:22.000
That was a good song.

01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:25.000
No Fancy, though, because this is alphabetical.

01:58:25.000 --> 01:58:27.000
So, save a horse, ride a cowboy.

01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:29.000
What's that?

01:58:29.000 --> 01:58:31.000
Stand by your man.

01:58:31.000 --> 01:58:34.000
Stand by your man.

01:58:34.000 --> 01:58:36.000
I only know that one from the Blues Brothers.

01:58:39.000 --> 01:58:41.000
This episode of OLR brought to you by...

01:58:41.000 --> 01:58:43.000
Derailed by Konami.

01:58:45.000 --> 01:58:46.000
Anyway, here you go, Pikachu.

01:58:46.000 --> 01:58:47.000
Why don't you...

01:58:47.000 --> 01:58:49.000
That little product placement there right in your arms.

01:58:49.000 --> 01:58:50.000
Thank you.

01:58:50.000 --> 01:58:51.000
Pika-what?

01:58:54.000 --> 01:58:57.000
Darticu says, karaoke revolution, country, stream, when?

01:58:57.000 --> 01:58:59.000
Okay, there's so many problems with that because

01:58:59.000 --> 01:59:02.000
A, I don't even have a working PlayStation 2 anywhere anymore.

01:59:02.000 --> 01:59:04.000
B, I don't...

01:59:04.000 --> 01:59:05.000
They don't use...

01:59:05.000 --> 01:59:06.000
Do PlayStation 2s have HDMI?

01:59:06.000 --> 01:59:08.000
I think they only have component.

01:59:08.000 --> 01:59:10.000
They only have component.

01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:12.000
But I've got converters.

01:59:12.000 --> 01:59:18.000
I do have a first model PS2 that is still in perfect working order.

01:59:18.000 --> 01:59:20.000
I have a Japanese one that's still in perfect working order.

01:59:20.000 --> 01:59:22.000
But I only have an HDMI capture card.

01:59:22.000 --> 01:59:24.000
So if it doesn't output HDMI, I can't do it.

01:59:24.000 --> 01:59:26.000
I've got converters.

01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:27.000
Okay.

01:59:27.000 --> 01:59:29.000
I'm worried about input lag.

01:59:32.000 --> 01:59:37.000
You can split the component cable and then capture off of...

01:59:37.000 --> 01:59:40.000
But, I still have your capture.

01:59:40.000 --> 01:59:41.000
Yes, the capture card will do it.

01:59:41.000 --> 01:59:43.000
And the CRT monitor.

01:59:44.000 --> 01:59:47.000
But, I have a PlayStation 2.

01:59:47.000 --> 01:59:49.000
I don't know if it reads discs anymore.

01:59:49.000 --> 01:59:51.000
Okay, I'm just gonna say, I don't wanna fucking play

01:59:51.000 --> 01:59:53.000
karaoke revolution, country.

01:59:53.000 --> 01:59:55.000
But it's enhanced for the iToy.

01:59:55.000 --> 01:59:57.000
If we're gonna hook up PlayStation 2,

01:59:57.000 --> 02:00:00.000
that one, maybe I'd play the DDR Extreme,

02:00:00.000 --> 02:00:03.000
or I would play BeatMania 2DX or something, but...

02:00:03.000 --> 02:00:05.000
Honestly, Rock Band is better than karaoke revolution,

02:00:05.000 --> 02:00:07.000
just saying, cause karaoke...

02:00:07.000 --> 02:00:09.000
Well, the Japanese karaoke revolution is a shit to play.

02:00:09.000 --> 02:00:11.000
And I bet Rock Band has fancy.

02:00:13.000 --> 02:00:15.000
Fancy is a good song.

02:00:15.000 --> 02:00:17.000
Alexa, does Rock Band have fancy?

02:00:19.000 --> 02:00:21.000
I probably set off someone's machino.

02:00:23.000 --> 02:00:26.000
Okay, Google, turn the lights to 50%.

02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:27.000
Stop it.

02:00:27.000 --> 02:00:29.000
That's okay, none of the Google servers are working anyway,

02:00:29.000 --> 02:00:31.000
so you're fine.

02:00:31.000 --> 02:00:33.000
I wanna know who I fucked up now.

02:00:33.000 --> 02:00:34.000
Moving on.

02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:36.000
Alright, stop messing with people.

02:00:36.000 --> 02:00:38.000
That's it for the mailbag. Thank you.

02:00:38.000 --> 02:00:41.000
From very kind email to karaoke revolution country,

02:00:41.000 --> 02:00:43.000
the tangents are strong this week on OLR.

02:00:43.000 --> 02:00:45.000
But we still have some more video game news to get to

02:00:45.000 --> 02:00:47.000
before we get to your calls on our Discord server.

02:00:47.000 --> 02:00:51.000
To answer your question, I believe fancy was part of Rock Band 2 DLC.

02:00:51.000 --> 02:00:52.000
Perfect.

02:00:52.000 --> 02:00:54.000
At least that's a YouTube video that says it was,

02:00:54.000 --> 02:00:56.000
so I'm gonna assume the title's correct.

02:00:56.000 --> 02:00:59.000
And that means we can probably import it into Rock Band 4,

02:00:59.000 --> 02:01:01.000
although the window for that is probably up,

02:01:01.000 --> 02:01:03.000
but Jamie, if at all possible,

02:01:03.000 --> 02:01:05.000
I think we need to do fancy.

02:01:05.000 --> 02:01:08.000
Oh my god, you did set off two people's Alexa.

02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:12.000
You set off Act Defs and Brad from Pod Culture.

02:01:12.000 --> 02:01:15.000
Did I get anybody's Google shit?

02:01:17.000 --> 02:01:19.000
Sorry, I wasn't trying to do that,

02:01:19.000 --> 02:01:21.000
but I think it's really funny.

02:01:21.000 --> 02:01:22.000
Hey Alexa, play-

02:01:22.000 --> 02:01:24.000
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:26.000
We're not gonna be that show. Alright, move on.

02:01:26.000 --> 02:01:27.000
I don't wanna be funny.

02:01:27.000 --> 02:01:28.000
Next story.

02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:29.000
I didn't trigger Google.

02:01:29.000 --> 02:01:31.000
I just got a text. Jerk.

02:01:31.000 --> 02:01:32.000
Who was that?

02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:33.000
From Pod Culture.

02:01:33.000 --> 02:01:34.000
Oh.

02:01:34.000 --> 02:01:36.000
I don't know, I was gonna have him play fancy.

02:01:37.000 --> 02:01:38.000
Play fancy.

02:01:38.000 --> 02:01:41.000
Fancy is the official new song of OLR.

02:01:41.000 --> 02:01:43.000
Alright, moving on.

02:01:43.000 --> 02:01:46.000
So, Call of Duty.

02:01:46.000 --> 02:01:49.000
They made the new announcement for the new Call of Duty,

02:01:49.000 --> 02:01:51.000
which is just gonna be Modern Warfare,

02:01:51.000 --> 02:01:54.000
as opposed to Call of Duty 4 Modern Warfare.

02:01:54.000 --> 02:01:55.000
It's a reboot.

02:01:55.000 --> 02:01:57.000
It's gonna be out October 25th,

02:01:57.000 --> 02:01:59.000
and what do we know about it?

02:01:59.000 --> 02:02:03.000
Well, they said that they're not gonna do an annual pass,

02:02:03.000 --> 02:02:08.000
that they're gonna have free content, maps, and, you know, stuff like that.

02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:10.000
You know that means loot boxes.

02:02:10.000 --> 02:02:13.000
That's just gonna fucking be full of fucking loot boxes,

02:02:13.000 --> 02:02:16.000
and cause- I'm sure it's full of crap like that.

02:02:16.000 --> 02:02:19.000
There's no way that they're not gonna do something like that.

02:02:19.000 --> 02:02:22.000
It is gonna be cross-play, so you can play between console and PC.

02:02:22.000 --> 02:02:27.000
No word on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, though.

02:02:27.000 --> 02:02:29.000
It's a brand new engine,

02:02:29.000 --> 02:02:32.000
and there's gonna be a single-player campaign,

02:02:32.000 --> 02:02:35.000
which means I'm gonna get it, because it has a single-player campaign.

02:02:35.000 --> 02:02:38.000
And co-op is back.

02:02:38.000 --> 02:02:40.000
And yeah.

02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:42.000
So that'll be awesome.

02:02:42.000 --> 02:02:43.000
I am very excited about it.

02:02:43.000 --> 02:02:45.000
And I'm assuming this is gonna be a big E3 push.

02:02:45.000 --> 02:02:46.000
Oh yeah.

02:02:46.000 --> 02:02:48.000
Activision doesn't really participate in E3.

02:02:48.000 --> 02:02:52.000
Sony, though, has the DLC timed exclusiveness.

02:02:52.000 --> 02:02:53.000
Sony's not doing E3.

02:02:53.000 --> 02:02:54.000
Right.

02:02:54.000 --> 02:02:56.000
Yeah, I don't know.

02:02:56.000 --> 02:02:59.000
I just imagine news will probably drop E3 week,

02:02:59.000 --> 02:03:01.000
whether they're there or not.

02:03:02.000 --> 02:03:03.000
Maybe.

02:03:03.000 --> 02:03:04.000
I don't know.

02:03:04.000 --> 02:03:06.000
Maybe the Switch gets it this year.

02:03:06.000 --> 02:03:08.000
Maybe it's one of those 21 games.

02:03:10.000 --> 02:03:12.000
Except you can't play with your friends online.

02:03:12.000 --> 02:03:14.000
Just kidding.

02:03:14.000 --> 02:03:17.000
Except it is Call of Duty 4 Modern Warfare.

02:03:17.000 --> 02:03:20.000
The original, not remastered. Just the original.

02:03:20.000 --> 02:03:21.000
So let's be real, Loki.

02:03:21.000 --> 02:03:24.000
Out of the three of us, you're the only one that would be interested in a game like this.

02:03:24.000 --> 02:03:26.000
You thinking about picking this one up?

02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:27.000
Yeah.

02:03:27.000 --> 02:03:28.000
Yep. No question.

02:03:28.000 --> 02:03:30.000
It looks good.

02:03:30.000 --> 02:03:31.000
Let's move on.

02:03:31.000 --> 02:03:35.000
You know, sometimes if you want to make a choice on if you're gonna buy a game or not,

02:03:35.000 --> 02:03:37.000
it might help you to be able to play that game in advance.

02:03:37.000 --> 02:03:43.000
And that's exactly what Nintendo plans to do with what they're calling a road rules style trip.

02:03:43.000 --> 02:03:48.000
A reference that nobody that would be the age of playing the Switch would even understand.

02:03:49.000 --> 02:03:52.000
Y'all remember that old show Road Rules on MTV?

02:03:52.000 --> 02:03:53.000
I remember.

02:03:53.000 --> 02:03:55.000
I auditioned for Road Rules.

02:03:55.000 --> 02:03:56.000
Can you believe?

02:03:56.000 --> 02:03:57.000
Oh god, I shouldn't even say that here on the show.

02:03:57.000 --> 02:03:58.000
I did.

02:03:58.000 --> 02:04:00.000
I auditioned for Real World and Road Rules.

02:04:00.000 --> 02:04:02.000
It was the year...

02:04:02.000 --> 02:04:03.000
It was Hawaii.

02:04:03.000 --> 02:04:05.000
It was whatever year that was for Real World.

02:04:05.000 --> 02:04:07.000
I sent in an audition tape for Real World Hawaii.

02:04:07.000 --> 02:04:10.000
And I wasn't even out of the closet at that age.

02:04:10.000 --> 02:04:12.000
Can you imagine what a fucking mess I would have been on that show?

02:04:12.000 --> 02:04:15.000
Thank god I got a polite rejection letter in the email.

02:04:15.000 --> 02:04:17.000
Or in the mail.

02:04:18.000 --> 02:04:19.000
Anyway.

02:04:19.000 --> 02:04:26.000
But Nintendo is gonna be doing less reality TV and more getting the Switch out there to play for people.

02:04:26.000 --> 02:04:30.000
After E3 is all done, it sounds like they're gonna kinda take their booth on the road a little bit.

02:04:30.000 --> 02:04:32.000
So it's gonna go on a little tour.

02:04:32.000 --> 02:04:36.000
It starts in Chicago from June 26th to the 30th at the Navy Pier.

02:04:36.000 --> 02:04:42.000
And will travel around the country, including right here in Sacramento at the California State Fair.

02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:44.000
July 12th through the 14th.

02:04:44.000 --> 02:04:47.000
So not the duration of the State Fair, but just those few days.

02:04:47.000 --> 02:04:49.000
I remember, do you remember this?

02:04:49.000 --> 02:04:53.000
When Rock Band 2 was traveling the country, they were at the State Fair.

02:04:53.000 --> 02:04:55.000
And we went and we played it.

02:04:55.000 --> 02:04:57.000
Rock Band 2 at the State Fair.

02:04:57.000 --> 02:04:58.000
I remember that.

02:04:58.000 --> 02:05:00.000
I did not play it there.

02:05:00.000 --> 02:05:01.000
Or did I?

02:05:01.000 --> 02:05:02.000
It was the first game.

02:05:02.000 --> 02:05:11.000
I played Rock Band though they did a thing that they were in West Sac for some festival, like music festival thing.

02:05:11.000 --> 02:05:16.000
And they had a Rock Band 2 or Rock Band stage set up and I remember playing it there.

02:05:16.000 --> 02:05:23.000
Well they'll be going from one VOG Network headquarters to another as they wrap up at the Georgia National Fair in Perry, Georgia.

02:05:23.000 --> 02:05:25.000
I'm not sure if Perry is an Atlanta suburb.

02:05:25.000 --> 02:05:27.000
But what games are going to be there?

02:05:27.000 --> 02:05:28.000
The games that are going to be there.

02:05:28.000 --> 02:05:34.000
Super Mario Maker 2, which is, I mean, it's going to be out by the time the game hits the first stop.

02:05:34.000 --> 02:05:35.000
But okay, whatever.

02:05:35.000 --> 02:05:41.000
Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, Pokemon Let's Go, Super Mario Party, and Splatoon 2.

02:05:41.000 --> 02:05:42.000
Here's my thought.

02:05:42.000 --> 02:05:46.000
They probably aren't announcing the ones that they haven't announced at E3 yet.

02:05:46.000 --> 02:05:49.000
So I wouldn't assume it's going to be limited to this.

02:05:49.000 --> 02:05:55.000
Because especially if it's traveling through October, you better believe there's going to be some holiday stuff in here too.

02:05:55.000 --> 02:05:59.000
So I would think Animal Crossing maybe? Depends if it's playable at E3 or not.

02:05:59.000 --> 02:06:06.000
But that could be interesting, Dark Sakura, if Animal Crossing is a game that is part of this bus.

02:06:06.000 --> 02:06:08.000
Are we going to have to go to the State Fair?

02:06:08.000 --> 02:06:09.000
I reckon.

02:06:10.000 --> 02:06:16.000
Well, on the plus side, they have a karaoke booth at the State Fair and I can sing fancy.

02:06:16.000 --> 02:06:17.000
I reckon.

02:06:20.000 --> 02:06:22.000
This is my pained look.

02:06:22.000 --> 02:06:26.000
Here's your one chance, Dark Sakura, don't let me down.

02:06:26.000 --> 02:06:28.000
Here's your one chance.

02:06:28.000 --> 02:06:29.000
There's your one chance.

02:06:29.000 --> 02:06:30.000
You're letting me down.

02:06:30.000 --> 02:06:31.000
All right.

02:06:32.000 --> 02:06:35.000
SSG100Matt says, go to the fair and do video.

02:06:35.000 --> 02:06:36.000
I just might.

02:06:36.000 --> 02:06:37.000
I just might not.

02:06:37.000 --> 02:06:38.000
I just might.

02:06:38.000 --> 02:06:39.000
All right.

02:06:39.000 --> 02:06:42.000
Bobby Blackwell says, Perry is a two hour drive for me.

02:06:42.000 --> 02:06:43.000
Bummer.

02:06:43.000 --> 02:06:45.000
Because the State Fair is like 10 minutes from here.

02:06:45.000 --> 02:06:46.000
So.

02:06:47.000 --> 02:06:49.000
YYR says to get the deep fried butter.

02:06:49.000 --> 02:06:50.000
Oh, God.

02:06:50.000 --> 02:06:51.000
Didn't we do?

02:06:51.000 --> 02:06:52.000
What did we do?

02:06:52.000 --> 02:06:56.000
We did deep fried Twinkies at one of our tournaments.

02:06:56.000 --> 02:06:58.000
Alan and I went to the State Fair randomly one year.

02:06:58.000 --> 02:07:01.000
We had deep fried Oreos and I just.

02:07:01.000 --> 02:07:03.000
They're not that good.

02:07:03.000 --> 02:07:05.000
And none of that deep fried stuff is that good.

02:07:05.000 --> 02:07:06.000
It just tastes like batter.

02:07:06.000 --> 02:07:07.000
Do I really want to eat a stick of butter?

02:07:07.000 --> 02:07:08.000
No.

02:07:08.000 --> 02:07:09.000
No.

02:07:09.000 --> 02:07:13.000
Our next tournament should be called Sacramento Makes Aggregious Gaming.

02:07:14.000 --> 02:07:18.000
S-M-E-G.

02:07:19.000 --> 02:07:20.000
Stop it.

02:07:21.000 --> 02:07:23.000
Well, we've had scat before.

02:07:24.000 --> 02:07:25.000
Yeah.

02:07:25.000 --> 02:07:29.000
For those who don't know, we had a DDR tournament here that we were all involved in and planning with.

02:07:29.000 --> 02:07:33.000
It was called Sacramento Cosplay and Tournament.

02:07:33.000 --> 02:07:35.000
And then what was the next one that we did?

02:07:35.000 --> 02:07:36.000
A shaft.

02:07:36.000 --> 02:07:37.000
Shaft.

02:07:37.000 --> 02:07:39.000
Sacramento hosts another fucking tournament.

02:07:39.000 --> 02:07:41.000
It was another fabulous tournament.

02:07:41.000 --> 02:07:43.000
Behind the scenes we were calling it another fucking tournament.

02:07:43.000 --> 02:07:44.000
Yeah.

02:07:44.000 --> 02:07:45.000
Yeah.

02:07:45.000 --> 02:07:46.000
So there you go.

02:07:46.000 --> 02:07:47.000
Shaft was fun though.

02:07:47.000 --> 02:07:48.000
That's when we had.

02:07:48.000 --> 02:07:49.000
Shaft was a great tournament.

02:07:49.000 --> 02:07:50.000
It was fun.

02:07:50.000 --> 02:07:51.000
We had people from everywhere.

02:07:51.000 --> 02:07:52.000
Shit.

02:07:52.000 --> 02:07:53.000
We should do that again.

02:07:53.000 --> 02:07:54.000
No we shouldn't.

02:07:54.000 --> 02:07:56.000
Jamie, we're in our 40s now.

02:07:56.000 --> 02:07:57.000
Fuck.

02:07:57.000 --> 02:07:58.000
I didn't say we're going to participate.

02:07:58.000 --> 02:07:59.000
You ain't got time for that.

02:07:59.000 --> 02:08:01.000
I didn't say we're going to participate.

02:08:01.000 --> 02:08:02.000
Alright.

02:08:02.000 --> 02:08:03.000
Moving on.

02:08:03.000 --> 02:08:04.000
Anyway.

02:08:04.000 --> 02:08:05.000
It wasn't my turn.

02:08:05.000 --> 02:08:07.000
I can participate in average attack.

02:08:07.000 --> 02:08:10.000
Because I'm pretty good at being average.

02:08:10.000 --> 02:08:11.000
Sometimes passing stuff.

02:08:11.000 --> 02:08:12.000
That's what we should do.

02:08:12.000 --> 02:08:15.000
We should do like how to be average at DDR.

02:08:15.000 --> 02:08:17.000
We should call it the mediocre tournament.

02:08:17.000 --> 02:08:18.000
Alright.

02:08:18.000 --> 02:08:19.000
How to be the most mediocre.

02:08:19.000 --> 02:08:20.000
Alright.

02:08:20.000 --> 02:08:22.000
I'm going to lay down the law with this next story.

02:08:22.000 --> 02:08:23.000
Darsakra.

02:08:23.000 --> 02:08:24.000
Yeah.

02:08:24.000 --> 02:08:25.000
Well.

02:08:25.000 --> 02:08:26.000
Um.

02:08:26.000 --> 02:08:27.000
And.

02:08:27.000 --> 02:08:28.000
I.

02:08:28.000 --> 02:08:32.000
I was looking at everything and this one just sort of is weird.

02:08:32.000 --> 02:08:37.000
So there is a lawsuit by Iron Maiden.

02:08:37.000 --> 02:08:39.000
Or at least.

02:08:39.000 --> 02:08:46.000
Their holding company has filed a 2 million dollar lawsuit against 3D Realms for their

02:08:46.000 --> 02:08:49.000
game Iron Maiden.

02:08:49.000 --> 02:08:50.000
Um.

02:08:50.000 --> 02:08:58.000
Claiming that it's using quote incredibly blatant end quote trademark infringement over

02:08:58.000 --> 02:09:00.000
so many different things.

02:09:00.000 --> 02:09:06.000
And it says that Iron Maiden would cause confusion amongst customers.

02:09:06.000 --> 02:09:09.000
I mean it's a video game so I don't know.

02:09:09.000 --> 02:09:15.000
But it says that their Iron Maiden name is of course very close to Iron Maiden.

02:09:15.000 --> 02:09:16.000
Um.

02:09:16.000 --> 02:09:20.000
And it also that the logo looks the same.

02:09:20.000 --> 02:09:23.000
That it's composition looks the same.

02:09:23.000 --> 02:09:28.000
And also other things that they're using that name to sell merchandise.

02:09:28.000 --> 02:09:29.000
Um.

02:09:30.000 --> 02:09:37.000
On top of that too is that they named a character after Steve Harris.

02:09:37.000 --> 02:09:39.000
And reworked their logo.

02:09:39.000 --> 02:09:40.000
Um.

02:09:41.000 --> 02:09:46.000
And that you know it also points out that the band has their own video game Legacy of

02:09:46.000 --> 02:09:47.000
the Beast.

02:09:47.000 --> 02:09:48.000
Um.

02:09:48.000 --> 02:09:53.000
Yeah they named a character Shelley Harrison after Steve Harris.

02:09:53.000 --> 02:09:59.000
And then it has the same type of looking gameplay as their game Legacy of the Beast.

02:09:59.000 --> 02:10:04.000
And it uses their yellow bomb emoji.

02:10:04.000 --> 02:10:05.000
Sorry.

02:10:05.000 --> 02:10:06.000
Shut up Siri.

02:10:06.000 --> 02:10:12.000
And so they use their yellow bomb emoji is similar to the Iron Maiden.

02:10:12.000 --> 02:10:15.000
Any character who shows up in all of their stuff.

02:10:15.000 --> 02:10:21.000
So it sounds like there's a question here like is this parody or is this really kind

02:10:21.000 --> 02:10:22.000
of like make him.

02:10:22.000 --> 02:10:27.000
I kind of get the sense that Iron Maiden maybe kind of had to file this because you know

02:10:27.000 --> 02:10:31.000
if you don't protect your intellectual property which Iron Maiden is a band is if you don't

02:10:31.000 --> 02:10:34.000
file to protect it then you have the possibility of losing it.

02:10:34.000 --> 02:10:40.000
Except I don't necessarily think they're being dicks but except Stern released Iron Maiden

02:10:40.000 --> 02:10:41.000
pinball.

02:10:43.000 --> 02:10:45.000
Yeah but they probably had to license that.

02:10:45.000 --> 02:10:48.000
Yeah but that means that they still have.

02:10:49.000 --> 02:10:54.000
I mean basically their their stuff is still protected it's still registered they would

02:10:54.000 --> 02:10:58.000
have had to have renewed any of their licensing to be able to outsource it.

02:10:58.000 --> 02:11:02.000
So as folks on Twitch can see Alan just sat down and join us because he's he's doing that

02:11:02.000 --> 02:11:05.000
thing where he's like I've got something to say he can hear the show going on in the other

02:11:05.000 --> 02:11:06.000
room.

02:11:06.000 --> 02:11:08.000
I just want to warn you this mic cable doesn't have a lot of slack on it so you might have

02:11:08.000 --> 02:11:10.000
to lean forward a little bit but what do you want to say.

02:11:10.000 --> 02:11:14.000
It'll be brief and yes I'm putting away groceries something piques my ear and I'm like well

02:11:14.000 --> 02:11:17.000
I have to give my opinion right now because it is very important.

02:11:18.000 --> 02:11:22.000
When dark secrets first started reading this story I was like it's a pun.

02:11:22.000 --> 02:11:23.000
Calm down.

02:11:23.000 --> 02:11:27.000
But then as the details kept going out more and more about how like they named it after

02:11:27.000 --> 02:11:34.000
the singer and the icon like it definitely sounds like they are it's be it's beyond just

02:11:34.000 --> 02:11:35.000
a pun.

02:11:35.000 --> 02:11:36.000
They're cashing in.

02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:42.000
They are making it really really miss mistake or something that's affiliated with the band

02:11:42.000 --> 02:11:44.000
but otherwise I and Maiden it's funny.

02:11:44.000 --> 02:11:46.000
That's a that's a great pun.

02:11:46.000 --> 02:11:48.000
But they just kept they kept kept it going.

02:11:48.000 --> 02:11:55.000
Like if I was going to do a game called Iron Maiden I would have it be more like an electric

02:11:55.000 --> 02:12:00.000
themed game or something you know with a cutesy girl that doesn't look anything Iron Maiden

02:12:00.000 --> 02:12:01.000
like.

02:12:01.000 --> 02:12:05.000
Now I made Alan sit back down because if you're going to invade the show like that then I'm

02:12:05.000 --> 02:12:07.000
going to ask you some questions have you talk about other stuff.

02:12:07.000 --> 02:12:13.000
So besides just Iron Maiden for your gaming week I know you picked up a new game because

02:12:13.000 --> 02:12:19.000
you're a big fan of a gaming series that I used to like a lot but what how is your gaming

02:12:19.000 --> 02:12:20.000
week.

02:12:20.000 --> 02:12:21.000
What did you pick up.

02:12:21.000 --> 02:12:25.000
It's Overwatch but you're specifically talking about MK 11.

02:12:25.000 --> 02:12:27.000
I am so MK 11 you've been playing it.

02:12:27.000 --> 02:12:28.000
What do you think.

02:12:28.000 --> 02:12:30.000
The story was really good.

02:12:30.000 --> 02:12:38.000
I really like how they are handling the particularly the female characters compared to how MK 9

02:12:38.000 --> 02:12:39.000
looked in 2011.

02:12:39.000 --> 02:12:41.000
But yeah the story is great.

02:12:41.000 --> 02:12:46.000
You know Jennifer I love Jennifer Hale you know fem chef forever but I feel like her

02:12:46.000 --> 02:12:53.000
voice is so recognizable to me that she just sounds the same even though I know she's doing

02:12:53.000 --> 02:12:57.000
different characters like because she's asked from Overwatch she's chronic and MK 11 and

02:12:57.000 --> 02:12:59.000
I'm like oh well that's Jennifer Hale.

02:12:59.000 --> 02:13:04.000
She's the OG she's the amazing voice actress in all video games but I just hear her all

02:13:04.000 --> 02:13:05.000
the time.

02:13:05.000 --> 02:13:09.000
But you noticed who voiced her daughter Mary Elizabeth McGlynn.

02:13:09.000 --> 02:13:10.000
Yes.

02:13:10.000 --> 02:13:16.000
And Ronda Rousey who I know is problematic for a bunch of other reasons.

02:13:16.000 --> 02:13:17.000
She did a good job.

02:13:17.000 --> 02:13:18.000
Yeah.

02:13:18.000 --> 02:13:19.000
Yeah.

02:13:19.000 --> 02:13:24.000
Everyone's like when Sonya talks Ronda Rousey and I'm like her performance in this video

02:13:24.000 --> 02:13:26.000
game is not one of the things you should be talking about.

02:13:26.000 --> 02:13:28.000
She's a great Sonya.

02:13:28.000 --> 02:13:29.000
I thought she was great.

02:13:29.000 --> 02:13:30.000
Yeah.

02:13:30.000 --> 02:13:31.000
Yeah.

02:13:31.000 --> 02:13:32.000
Interesting.

02:13:32.000 --> 02:13:36.000
But you know all the other crap we will leave to being outside the game I suppose.

02:13:36.000 --> 02:13:38.000
So separate the art from the artist I guess.

02:13:38.000 --> 02:13:39.000
So all right.

02:13:39.000 --> 02:13:42.000
That was really all I want to give out since I can't talk about MK 11.

02:13:42.000 --> 02:13:43.000
I thought maybe you'd want to say something.

02:13:43.000 --> 02:13:44.000
So anything else for you.

02:13:44.000 --> 02:13:45.000
It is on your wish list.

02:13:45.000 --> 02:13:48.000
I was thinking about getting it for you but then you'd have to stream it and you'd be

02:13:48.000 --> 02:13:52.000
like ew it's gross ew stop it and I don't want to waste like $60.

02:13:52.000 --> 02:13:54.000
I've already had it threatened.

02:13:54.000 --> 02:13:59.000
Good old Shane keeps saying you need to get Five Nights at Freddy's VR.

02:13:59.000 --> 02:14:01.000
Don't you want to stream Five Nights at Freddy's VR?

02:14:01.000 --> 02:14:04.000
Like Five Nights at Freddy's VR would be fun for the following reasons.

02:14:04.000 --> 02:14:05.000
OK.

02:14:05.000 --> 02:14:08.000
So Rob I know we haven't talked in a day but last night I made a list of 20 reasons why

02:14:08.000 --> 02:14:11.000
you should have Five Nights at Freddy's VR.

02:14:11.000 --> 02:14:16.000
Aside from getting you the game he needs to write like a check like to the charitable

02:14:16.000 --> 02:14:17.000
organization of your choice.

02:14:17.000 --> 02:14:21.000
I will play it for five minutes if you give five hundred dollars to the Southern Poverty

02:14:21.000 --> 02:14:24.000
Law Center and he's like I'm never doing that.

02:14:24.000 --> 02:14:27.000
And you're like well then I guess we have our answer.

02:14:27.000 --> 02:14:29.000
I'm going to remember that one for later.

02:14:29.000 --> 02:14:30.000
I'll probably get it.

02:14:30.000 --> 02:14:31.000
Thank you Alan.

02:14:31.000 --> 02:14:32.000
Thank you for crashing the show.

02:14:32.000 --> 02:14:33.000
Your opinion is always welcome.

02:14:33.000 --> 02:14:34.000
You know that.

02:14:34.000 --> 02:14:37.000
I bought it and I almost purchased it today.

02:14:37.000 --> 02:14:39.000
I'll play it I guess.

02:14:39.000 --> 02:14:41.000
I don't really like Five Nights at Freddy's.

02:14:41.000 --> 02:14:44.000
My God he does not stop talking about Five Nights at Freddy's.

02:14:44.000 --> 02:14:47.000
It's everything that comes out of his mouth is Five Nights at Freddy's.

02:14:47.000 --> 02:14:49.000
He's playing Five Nights at Freddy's Roblox stuff.

02:14:49.000 --> 02:14:52.000
I'm telling you when I did that panel with the voice actors at Dragon Con like I was

02:14:52.000 --> 02:14:56.000
thinking it was going to be people like Shane like you know just like but no it was all

02:14:56.000 --> 02:14:58.000
like 12 year olds in the audience.

02:14:58.000 --> 02:14:59.000
The kids love it.

02:14:59.000 --> 02:15:00.000
It could be Fortnite.

02:15:00.000 --> 02:15:01.000
It could be worse.

02:15:01.000 --> 02:15:02.000
It could be Fortnite.

02:15:02.000 --> 02:15:03.000
That's true.

02:15:03.000 --> 02:15:05.000
It could be girls in Fortnite but just mostly the creative mode.

02:15:05.000 --> 02:15:10.000
But yeah it's like it's just it's all about Five Nights at Freddy's.

02:15:10.000 --> 02:15:13.000
It's like always just spewing Five Nights at Freddy's facts.

02:15:13.000 --> 02:15:18.000
And like you know I always got that thing from like my wife about how she would say

02:15:18.000 --> 02:15:20.000
that I talk about games too much.

02:15:20.000 --> 02:15:23.000
It's like it's always games games games.

02:15:23.000 --> 02:15:26.000
It's like I never thought I would get to the point where I get annoyed about hearing

02:15:26.000 --> 02:15:30.000
about something from somebody about a similar topic over and over.

02:15:30.000 --> 02:15:35.000
But here we are at this point where I was like I really don't give a shit about Five

02:15:35.000 --> 02:15:40.000
Nights at Freddy's that I need to hear about this much about this one game.

02:15:40.000 --> 02:15:41.000
But dad did you know.

02:15:41.000 --> 02:15:42.000
Dad did you know.

02:15:42.000 --> 02:15:43.000
Did you know.

02:15:43.000 --> 02:15:45.000
Did you know.

02:15:45.000 --> 02:15:47.000
Daddy I have something to tell you.

02:15:47.000 --> 02:15:48.000
OK.

02:15:48.000 --> 02:15:53.000
You know in Five Nights at Freddy's you know sister location you get blah blah blah blah

02:15:53.000 --> 02:15:54.000
blah.

02:15:54.000 --> 02:15:59.000
And in this one they have a nightmare Freddy you can do this and twisted this and I like

02:15:59.000 --> 02:16:00.000
I don't care.

02:16:00.000 --> 02:16:05.000
I swear to God I need to make an overlay for our twitch thing that like takes the sidebar

02:16:05.000 --> 02:16:09.000
away and puts tangent train with a little train ground because right now it still says

02:16:09.000 --> 02:16:14.000
I am made in lawsuit and how disconnected have we become from that topic at this point.

02:16:14.000 --> 02:16:15.000
It's just funny.

02:16:15.000 --> 02:16:16.000
Incredible.

02:16:16.000 --> 02:16:19.000
Welcome to Orange Lounge Radio y'all.

02:16:19.000 --> 02:16:20.000
All right.

02:16:20.000 --> 02:16:21.000
Moving on.

02:16:21.000 --> 02:16:25.000
Speaking speaking of things in places where they don't belong what do we have next.

02:16:25.000 --> 02:16:26.000
Yes.

02:16:27.000 --> 02:16:33.000
We have cars getting more games so apparently for some reason you can port or you're going

02:16:33.000 --> 02:16:41.000
to be able to play Cuphead in a Tesla because that's a neat thing to do I guess.

02:16:41.000 --> 02:16:46.000
I'm not sure why you want to do that trip but it's only compatible I guess with a wired

02:16:46.000 --> 02:16:50.000
USB controller so you can't do any touch screen stuff.

02:16:50.000 --> 02:16:53.000
But why the hell would you want to in the first place.

02:16:53.000 --> 02:16:55.000
Sorry you can't play with the steering wheel.

02:16:55.000 --> 02:16:57.000
But yeah.

02:16:57.000 --> 02:17:00.000
So it's neat that you can play a game on it.

02:17:00.000 --> 02:17:01.000
And Bob.

02:17:01.000 --> 02:17:06.000
Bobby does point out it only works in park so it's not for the passenger which is probably

02:17:06.000 --> 02:17:10.000
for the best that these things only work when the car is parked.

02:17:10.000 --> 02:17:11.000
Yes.

02:17:11.000 --> 02:17:12.000
So neat.

02:17:12.000 --> 02:17:14.000
It's a neat unnecessary thing.

02:17:14.000 --> 02:17:18.000
Can you sit there and play it while you're waiting for the car to charge because I imagine

02:17:18.000 --> 02:17:22.000
the inflow from the chargers far outweighs what it costs to play the game.

02:17:22.000 --> 02:17:24.000
Maybe might be a way to kill time while you're waiting.

02:17:24.000 --> 02:17:25.000
I don't know.

02:17:25.000 --> 02:17:27.000
So that might be a neat idea.

02:17:27.000 --> 02:17:28.000
Yeah.

02:17:28.000 --> 02:17:29.000
Or how about you know Bob.

02:17:29.000 --> 02:17:31.000
Bobby says it's for the supercharger stops.

02:17:31.000 --> 02:17:32.000
Yes.

02:17:32.000 --> 02:17:33.000
That's what it's for.

02:17:33.000 --> 02:17:34.000
That's what all the Atari games are for.

02:17:34.000 --> 02:17:35.000
So I hit it.

02:17:35.000 --> 02:17:36.000
I hit.

02:17:36.000 --> 02:17:37.000
I feel.

02:17:37.000 --> 02:17:38.000
Wow.

02:17:38.000 --> 02:17:39.000
My mind.

02:17:39.000 --> 02:17:40.000
It's just like Elon Musk's.

02:17:40.000 --> 02:17:41.000
Wow.

02:17:41.000 --> 02:17:45.000
Maybe we can get Xbox Game Pass or their streaming service or something like that in on that.

02:17:45.000 --> 02:17:49.500
And I think that's a pretty clever idea though because you know that's the one thing that

02:17:49.500 --> 02:17:53.000
some people have reservations about the Tesla is that with the big road trips you have

02:17:53.000 --> 02:17:56.800
to kind of make the stops you know and you might have to stop a little bit longer than

02:17:56.800 --> 02:18:00.000
you might have to at a gas station to charge the car a decent amount.

02:18:00.000 --> 02:18:03.440
But you know Tesla's thinking of these ways to make that time passing a little more fun

02:18:03.440 --> 02:18:07.920
which I'm still I still would be I would be interested in a Tesla someday you know maybe

02:18:07.920 --> 02:18:13.000
when my current car gives out if the price on those things keeps coming down and as technology

02:18:13.000 --> 02:18:17.000
gets better and better and the rest of the auto industry is responding you know with

02:18:17.000 --> 02:18:20.580
things like Prius Prime and the other you know electrical cars are seen out there I'm

02:18:20.580 --> 02:18:23.740
just so curious what's going to look like in just a few more years.

02:18:23.740 --> 02:18:24.740
So anyhow.

02:18:24.740 --> 02:18:25.740
All right.

02:18:25.740 --> 02:18:29.420
They said though it isn't the full version of Cuphead.

02:18:29.420 --> 02:18:37.420
Apparently Tesla has some storage limitations and so only Inkwell aisle one section is available.

02:18:37.420 --> 02:18:41.580
Well then you should be able to continue on to download the next section instead you know

02:18:41.580 --> 02:18:42.580
as you go along.

02:18:42.580 --> 02:18:43.580
Yeah.

02:18:44.160 --> 02:18:50.840
Or you know maybe expandable memory expandable storage because I'm sure that right now Loki

02:18:50.840 --> 02:18:52.520
is it a car or a game console.

02:18:52.520 --> 02:18:54.220
Come on.

02:18:54.220 --> 02:18:55.220
Why not.

02:18:55.220 --> 02:18:56.220
Both.

02:18:56.220 --> 02:18:58.480
All right.

02:18:58.480 --> 02:19:03.080
I still like the idea that there's like pole position on those cars but you actually use

02:19:03.080 --> 02:19:04.240
the steering wheel.

02:19:04.240 --> 02:19:08.240
I would like to see Mario Kart but you actually use the steering wheel.

02:19:08.240 --> 02:19:12.080
I forgot to mention during game day it's probably not technologically possible but give give

02:19:12.080 --> 02:19:13.080
Tesla.

02:19:13.580 --> 02:19:19.260
I played the I forgot I did play the beta test for the mobile marker I've heard it's

02:19:19.260 --> 02:19:27.180
controversial as some of the microtransactions yeah it's it's all right.

02:19:27.180 --> 02:19:32.140
I wouldn't play very long comes the tangent range you know I'm just that's all I got.

02:19:32.140 --> 02:19:33.140
What.

02:19:33.140 --> 02:19:34.140
Tell us.

02:19:34.140 --> 02:19:35.140
Tell me a little more about it.

02:19:35.140 --> 02:19:36.140
So like the controls are OK.

02:19:36.140 --> 02:19:41.720
But yeah it is pretty heavy on the microtransactions I played a few races in there.

02:19:41.720 --> 02:19:47.020
I still don't like the controls like didn't seem that it seemed kind of floaty for me

02:19:47.020 --> 02:19:52.900
but I don't know I don't know if I could see myself playing it for a very long time.

02:19:52.900 --> 02:19:54.500
It was cool to try out though.

02:19:54.500 --> 02:19:57.540
I guess we'll see when the game releases.

02:19:57.540 --> 02:19:58.540
Who knows.

02:19:58.540 --> 02:20:02.980
Anyhow before we get to our listener roundtable if you have some questions in our chat room

02:20:02.980 --> 02:20:08.940
or you want to give us a call via our discord server over at vog network dot com slash discord.

02:20:08.940 --> 02:20:12.920
Before we get to that let's talk about the Contra collection because you know Konami

02:20:12.920 --> 02:20:16.480
had that arcade collection not that long ago they just recently did the Castlevania collection

02:20:16.480 --> 02:20:20.840
which I picked up and some people are looking forward to the Contra collection and the full

02:20:20.840 --> 02:20:25.440
list of what will be available in that collection has been announced including Contra the arcade

02:20:25.440 --> 02:20:32.020
version Super Contra the arcade version Super C on the NES Contra 3 on the Super Nintendo

02:20:32.020 --> 02:20:38.880
that was nice Contra hardcore on the Sega Genesis Contra on the NES Contra on the Famicom

02:20:38.900 --> 02:20:46.580
Operation C on the Game Boy, Probo Protector on the Sega Mega Drive which is kind of like

02:20:46.580 --> 02:20:51.020
Contra adjacent and Super Pro Protector Alien Rebels on the Super Nintendo.

02:20:51.020 --> 02:20:53.500
They were reskins for Europe.

02:20:53.500 --> 02:21:01.700
Ah gotcha so that's what those are so that is all coming out let's see oh by the way

02:21:01.700 --> 02:21:07.060
they also announced the Japanese games will be included in an in like a patch that follows

02:21:07.060 --> 02:21:11.720
a little later on so there is that as well that's pretty cool $20 they haven't dated

02:21:11.720 --> 02:21:18.720
it yet I thought they did so now could this be hinting at something bigger and perhaps

02:21:18.720 --> 02:21:23.000
this is one of those 21 games we're going to learn about next week or a little over

02:21:23.000 --> 02:21:31.020
a week a German retailer net games has posted a new Contra game on switch PlayStation 4

02:21:31.020 --> 02:21:38.320
and Xbox one all sharing a release date of September 24th 2019 this is a from the collection

02:21:38.320 --> 02:21:44.080
so could after all Konami had pretty good success when they rebooted bomber man could

02:21:44.080 --> 02:21:49.960
Contra be next on their list I'll be very interesting to see so maybe that's maybe that's

02:21:49.960 --> 02:21:55.860
something in store for e3 we'll see I fully look forward to Contra act zero you never

02:21:55.860 --> 02:22:01.160
know you never know all right yeah dark to see and chat over twitch TV slash vlog network

02:22:01.160 --> 02:22:05.880
says I didn't think this listing was for Contra collection yeah so if this new one is good

02:22:05.880 --> 02:22:09.920
I'd be down yeah it's all about what they plan to do with it that's for sure so we'll

02:22:09.920 --> 02:22:15.960
see so anyway I'm gonna get discord up here so we can actually take some calls and discord

02:22:15.960 --> 02:22:20.440
and if you have questions in our chat room over at twitch TV slash vlog network you can

02:22:20.440 --> 02:22:25.360
ask away there as well while I'm getting set up here since I'm a couple weeks out of practice

02:22:25.360 --> 02:22:28.460
Loki do we have any last minute stories things we want to talk about before we get there

02:22:28.460 --> 02:22:35.100
uh no I know I thought we had extra stuff we didn't come oh yeah I'm fine new stuff

02:22:35.100 --> 02:22:39.660
I need to talk about okay well I do one and then I'll get to a call all right fine so

02:22:39.660 --> 02:22:47.700
I I did bring up earlier when we're talking about the new R type thing so that was pretty

02:22:47.700 --> 02:22:54.060
awesome that they're gonna have that Kickstarter well there's stuff checks quest the remaster

02:22:54.060 --> 02:23:01.280
finally came out so you can check it out and they added the third episode so that's

02:23:01.280 --> 02:23:06.760
pretty cool you can actually play that I think for free where can we download that is it

02:23:06.760 --> 02:23:15.280
checks quest calm or something I don't know yeah checks mix comm slash checks quest and

02:23:15.280 --> 02:23:21.400
you can download it and play it I'm so excited I'm going to get right on that while I are

02:23:21.400 --> 02:23:25.140
asked did they announce a developer for the contra collection m2 did the Castlevania

02:23:25.140 --> 02:23:29.100
collection and that's why it was really good hamster did the arcade collection that's why

02:23:29.100 --> 02:23:34.020
it was really bad I didn't realize they had different developers I thought I thought m2

02:23:34.020 --> 02:23:40.100
is doing them all but I guess not one other thing we can talk about so John Romero made

02:23:40.100 --> 02:23:47.220
a new doom mod or super water make a wad for the game so it's called sigil you can go check

02:23:47.220 --> 02:23:53.840
that out as well so that's a pretty cool thing yeah you can get that at Romero games

02:23:53.840 --> 02:24:02.840
dot IE slash sigil it with a six instead of a G all right and no I can't I tried googling

02:24:02.840 --> 02:24:07.340
it and I don't I don't see who is actually doing that yet so we'll have to wait and see

02:24:07.340 --> 02:24:12.680
so orange right thinks it's got to be m2 though so yeah I kind of I kind of agree with that

02:24:12.680 --> 02:24:19.380
so all right well let's get to some calls at vog network.com slash discord and we've

02:24:19.380 --> 02:24:22.980
brought our first person into chat so let's say hello hi you're on orange on radio who's

02:24:22.980 --> 02:24:28.900
this yeah this is middle man ham how are you hey I'm good how are you buddy I'm pretty

02:24:28.900 --> 02:24:37.200
good you know actually the lineup of your topics it was perfect timing because I was

02:24:37.200 --> 02:24:46.580
planning on talking about retro collections sure as we all probably know very very well

02:24:46.580 --> 02:24:55.400
you know retro collections have been coming out for ages at least since the 16-bit generation

02:24:55.400 --> 02:25:04.780
sure super mario all-stars was a retro collection of sorts right exactly so it you know I was

02:25:04.780 --> 02:25:13.640
wondering if I have a two-part question a do you have like a particular favorite retro

02:25:13.640 --> 02:25:20.760
collection and B has there been any collections they have not come out yet for whatever reason

02:25:20.760 --> 02:25:26.520
that you would like to see okay good questions a what is your favorite retro collection thus

02:25:26.520 --> 02:25:33.360
far any any answers to that I would actually say honestly even though I just said it super

02:25:33.380 --> 02:25:38.780
mario all-stars like set the bar in many ways like yeah it really you know it kind of reskin

02:25:38.780 --> 02:25:43.420
those games and especially like the way mario one kind of looked was really transformed

02:25:43.420 --> 02:25:49.300
and it brought you know the lost levels which we all know was mario 2 in japan to us for

02:25:49.300 --> 02:25:53.620
the first time and I thought I think was just such a bang-up well-done collection and with

02:25:53.620 --> 02:25:57.260
as much shit as we give nintendo on this show for some of their choices such as the mario

02:25:57.260 --> 02:26:01.140
maker multiplayer man when they invest in something like that like a retro collection

02:26:01.140 --> 02:26:06.500
like they they do a really good job I did like the mega man legacy collection yeah that was pretty

02:26:06.500 --> 02:26:11.540
good yeah those are pretty good too uh dar sakura you you're a big retro gamer what do you have any

02:26:11.540 --> 02:26:16.020
retro collections that you're a fan of uh we haven't bought any in so long I mean we've got

02:26:16.020 --> 02:26:23.220
some of the title collections we have um well I mean I did just last year grab salamander deluxe

02:26:23.220 --> 02:26:30.020
pack for the sake of saturn so that's a retro collection I mean it's really kind of hard for

02:26:30.020 --> 02:26:35.060
us to pick up any of the newer ones because we either have the original title or we have another

02:26:35.060 --> 02:26:40.500
collection that's got it in there so you know I would say the other standouts that come to my

02:26:40.500 --> 02:26:45.620
mind before we get to question b uh I would say the other stand is my mind the grottiest collection

02:26:45.620 --> 02:26:51.620
on psp was very well done and the psp just in general you know we kind of look back on it as

02:26:51.620 --> 02:26:54.820
you know it was in some ways was ahead of its time there were some really good games on it like it

02:26:54.820 --> 02:26:59.380
had the best version of fantasy 4 although that wasn't a red that wasn't a retro collection but

02:26:59.460 --> 02:27:04.980
yeah the grottiest collection on psp was great uh and I would say the midway arcade treasures

02:27:04.980 --> 02:27:07.940
were pretty good for their time they had you remember those the midway arcade treasures I

02:27:07.940 --> 02:27:12.500
think was on the original xbox uh as well as it might have been on 360 I think it was the original

02:27:12.500 --> 02:27:17.780
xbox as well as like playstation 2 and those were some good collections of um you know 80s arcade

02:27:17.780 --> 02:27:22.340
games at the time you know midway put out some really good uh games back in the day and you know

02:27:22.340 --> 02:27:26.420
things like root beer tapper and robotron and it was this really good collection I think they had

02:27:26.420 --> 02:27:29.540
three of those at the end of it because I think the third one was all like racing games but the

02:27:29.540 --> 02:27:35.700
first two uh especially were really really solid so um yeah those are my answers uh act deft points

02:27:35.700 --> 02:27:41.140
out in our chat room the sega genesis collections are really great too oh yeah I think playstation

02:27:41.140 --> 02:27:46.340
yeah those are xbox 360 had that sega mega genesis collection or whatever yeah those are pretty good

02:27:46.340 --> 02:27:52.100
those are really good yeah that was a sega did a great job with those on console so um yeah so

02:27:52.100 --> 02:27:58.100
then metal mayhem's b question was what's a retro collection you would like to see

02:27:58.100 --> 02:28:04.180
that's a pretty good question as well uh loki uh that's a tough one um

02:28:07.300 --> 02:28:13.300
I don't know I mean there's just so much stuff out there I would like to see maybe like uh just a

02:28:14.020 --> 02:28:17.540
I don't know we already got in like a Nintendo collection too with like the NES classics so

02:28:18.420 --> 02:28:23.380
uh I don't know I don't have an answer for that I guess if I'd like to see anything I would love

02:28:23.380 --> 02:28:32.900
to see like a collection um a new collection of dreamcast or uh sega Saturn games I want a PC

02:28:32.900 --> 02:28:41.220
engine um shooters compilation like some of the ones we never got in the US um and another

02:28:41.220 --> 02:28:46.500
actually the ginga density series that came out on PSP in Japan love to have that come out of

02:28:46.500 --> 02:28:50.740
here because I think people need to play sapphire uh how about that second it sets

02:28:50.740 --> 02:28:54.820
who collection in the us I'd like to see that which by the way did make our show world tonight

02:28:54.820 --> 02:29:01.540
but I believe uh there was one of those trademark filings that said collection of mana so that that

02:29:01.540 --> 02:29:05.140
might be one of the 21 yeah there you go there that might be that's you know I mentioned earlier

02:29:05.140 --> 02:29:10.660
there's your screen yeah so that that one could be real and again that is a big fucking deal

02:29:11.540 --> 02:29:16.740
if they get second three if second three is a part of it which may explain why it's taken

02:29:16.740 --> 02:29:23.060
a long time to get from the Japanese version to here if they cut second three then my my

02:29:23.060 --> 02:29:28.260
answer is null and void but there is a fan translation that has been deemed as free use

02:29:28.260 --> 02:29:34.900
oh yeah the roms already but even the the Japanese text in the graphics have been translated I would

02:29:34.900 --> 02:29:38.500
love to see and for them to put out that collection here I would love them to see

02:29:38.500 --> 02:29:43.060
add secretive evermore I know that game gets shit on as the square USA title but I think

02:29:43.060 --> 02:29:47.220
there were some great there were some great moments in that game that are worth you know

02:29:47.220 --> 02:29:52.500
and it's it's it was Jeremy Saleh's first composition so you know he went on to do you

02:29:52.500 --> 02:29:56.900
know what guild wars and elder scrolls and all that stuff what if we had a new Sega ages fantasy

02:29:56.900 --> 02:30:05.460
star collection or Sega ages does such good retro stuff well I've got the the first fantasy star

02:30:05.460 --> 02:30:09.620
Sega ages one the Japanese one and it's pretty beautiful I mean we played it with a friend

02:30:09.620 --> 02:30:16.420
translating it for us but it was great or or or or or I want a grandia collection like all three

02:30:16.420 --> 02:30:21.860
grandia games I would as they were I would like to see this is going to be a little bit cliche

02:30:21.860 --> 02:30:29.540
but I would like to see a final fantasy collection on switch that's one through six but takes the PSP

02:30:29.540 --> 02:30:35.380
version of most of those or the Game Boy Advance version of like six some of those yeah none of

02:30:36.340 --> 02:30:44.340
the 3d stuff yeah but I mean or both porque no los dos have them both so uh but let me choose

02:30:44.340 --> 02:30:50.740
if I want to play Final Fantasy 4 in 2d or in 3d I shouldn't I shouldn't the 3d was okay but

02:30:50.740 --> 02:30:56.740
obviously since my memories go back to Final Fantasy 2 on the Super Nintendo right that's

02:30:56.740 --> 02:31:00.340
just how that game is always going to be for me I was just still tickled we got you know that

02:31:00.340 --> 02:31:05.060
Castlevania collection with Rondo of Blood and everything yeah because fucking Rondo of Blood is

02:31:05.060 --> 02:31:10.660
probably the bet well I will say Symphony of the Night or Nocturne in the Moonlight is probably

02:31:10.660 --> 02:31:16.340
one of the best Castlevania games ever but Rondo was fucking badass yeah with the multiple paths

02:31:16.340 --> 02:31:21.780
and everything huh so Metal Mayhem before I let you go what retro collection would you like to see

02:31:23.060 --> 02:31:29.700
uh well I think it's been done on the PS2 already but unfortunately I never got it

02:31:30.500 --> 02:31:36.260
so I'm gonna say uh Samurai Showdown collection for PC

02:31:37.780 --> 02:31:47.140
know that yeah I know that you know Samurai Showdown 2 and 5 are available on both steam and

02:31:47.140 --> 02:31:57.940
dog around those two games are great but my personal favorite is 4 because I sunk entire

02:31:57.940 --> 02:32:06.420
paychecks into you know Samurai Showdown 4 while I was in college way back in the day I have not

02:32:06.420 --> 02:32:14.100
been able to play in that game since and I I know if you want to go the shady route you can

02:32:14.100 --> 02:32:20.900
illegally download DRAM but you don't want to go down to that route I want I want to support

02:32:20.900 --> 02:32:25.460
SNK you know hey hey dark to see he's got some good news for you there is a Samurai Showdown

02:32:25.460 --> 02:32:31.700
Neo Geo collection that's happening on the Switch this fall uh well that's great if you're on the

02:32:31.700 --> 02:32:38.900
Switch but I don't know who to switch so well a lot a lot of those show up on PC so you might get

02:32:38.900 --> 02:32:42.820
lucky you might get lucky so all right well Metal Mayhem we're gonna let you go so we can get some

02:32:42.820 --> 02:32:46.740
more calls but thank you that's a good question tonight and uh we'll see you next time all right

02:32:46.740 --> 02:32:52.500
have a good one you too buddy take care all right let's get to another call hello you are on Orange

02:32:52.500 --> 02:32:57.620
Tons Radio who's this hey this is Acteft hey Acteft it's good to hear from you buddy what's up

02:32:58.900 --> 02:33:03.860
well I want to talk about the Pokemon conference that happened this week yeah I've been kind of a

02:33:03.860 --> 02:33:07.700
little bit out of the loop on Pokemon so I'd love to hear your thoughts I mean obviously

02:33:07.700 --> 02:33:13.060
Pokemon Sleep was a thing but uh what what were your what was your thoughts on it well yeah

02:33:13.060 --> 02:33:18.900
Pokemon Sleep was probably like not necessarily the biggest but the most interesting of all of all

02:33:18.900 --> 02:33:25.780
the announcements they made especially because it's it seems kind of weird for Niantic in this

02:33:25.780 --> 02:33:32.980
case and also Pokemon Company and Nintendo to to focus on that but if if if we look back to

02:33:33.620 --> 02:33:40.260
the Vitality sensor and other stuff that Nintendo has tried to to do with health and all that stuff

02:33:40.260 --> 02:33:46.820
and in the past it's it's something like okay I can see it work again not necessarily something

02:33:46.820 --> 02:33:54.100
that most people will be like really excited about but me personally I'm really like interested

02:33:54.100 --> 02:34:02.100
in it and and how it works and and probably can how can it uh benefit or how can it help for

02:34:02.100 --> 02:34:11.460
for our health but but yeah aside that uh we also had uh some really great and big announcements too

02:34:11.460 --> 02:34:18.260
like uh you already talked about Detective Pikachu on Switch and and it's something like okay since

02:34:18.260 --> 02:34:24.980
I didn't get the 3DS version I'm really excited to get that on Switch I heard it's not the greatest

02:34:24.980 --> 02:34:30.340
game or the most difficult but it seems like if you like the movie if you like the story and

02:34:31.060 --> 02:34:37.860
you want to like explore a little bit more of the lore it seems like a good option but also like

02:34:37.860 --> 02:34:43.940
Pokemon making its way to China it's like a really big deal that is that is a very big deal

02:34:43.940 --> 02:34:48.980
you're right uh it's a heck of a thing to uh to um overlook but obviously that's something that's

02:34:48.980 --> 02:34:53.620
not going to impact this market but sure as Pokemon on a global scale uh Pokemon coming to

02:34:53.620 --> 02:34:59.060
China is a huge deal yeah and and and this is certainly not the biggest game like it's Pokemon

02:34:59.060 --> 02:35:08.820
Quest and it isn't that great of a game uh but at least for like making its way like Pokemon making

02:35:08.820 --> 02:35:15.060
like its appearance official appearance at least in China it's it's gonna be huge I think and

02:35:15.060 --> 02:35:22.580
hopefully it it will work and maybe the market there will expand like a lot because uh I think

02:35:22.580 --> 02:35:28.180
currently you cannot play Pokemon Go in China so it's like no maybe that will change in the future

02:35:28.180 --> 02:35:32.740
but yeah I don't even know if Ingress is a thing in China I think I think it actually I think it

02:35:32.740 --> 02:35:38.020
does exist but I yeah I don't even know to like yeah I think actually there is Ingress uh and

02:35:38.020 --> 02:35:43.540
stops and things like that so it's the infrastructure set up for it uh with all the stops and the the

02:35:43.540 --> 02:35:47.860
spawns but yeah I don't know if it's actually there or if it's firewalled out or what so

02:35:48.420 --> 02:35:54.340
um be interesting to see what develops with that for sure yeah that's that's gonna be like really

02:35:54.340 --> 02:36:01.220
really great to see and again hopefully it will work for Pokemon Company uh on China but the

02:36:01.220 --> 02:36:09.220
future will tell um other thing uh a style Pokemon Home that's gonna be like I'm really excited about

02:36:09.220 --> 02:36:17.860
that actually like it's it's probably like the most the the thing that most people like are

02:36:17.860 --> 02:36:24.180
really like hyped about yeah and basically and you already talked about it but I'm gonna

02:36:24.180 --> 02:36:28.900
try to explain it like uh briefly it's basically you can transfer any Pokemon to the cloud

02:36:29.700 --> 02:36:38.340
from your 3DS like the virtual console games and and the sixth generation seven generation uh also

02:36:38.340 --> 02:36:44.660
from Pokemon Let's Go, Pokemon and Pokemon Go even like it's gonna be awesome that you can transfer

02:36:44.660 --> 02:36:51.380
all to the cloud and you can move them to Pokemon Sword and Shield and that's gonna be like really

02:36:51.780 --> 02:36:58.340
really great because uh like it's it's really a hassle for for those who want to complete the

02:36:58.340 --> 02:37:05.300
Pokedex like have in this case it's gonna be like over 900 Pokemon at this point so it's like yeah

02:37:06.340 --> 02:37:12.340
like having like your Pokemon from like spare Pokemon from Pokemon Go and even Let's Go and

02:37:12.340 --> 02:37:17.940
other and other and the other game sorry it's gonna be like really great to complete uh your

02:37:17.940 --> 02:37:24.100
Pokedex and just focus like oh I only need the the ones from this generation or I don't need

02:37:24.100 --> 02:37:30.500
that many so it's that it's gonna be really really good and again most people are really

02:37:31.060 --> 02:37:36.820
I'm really excited about that one I hope I hope that the service doesn't cost that much because

02:37:37.620 --> 02:37:44.260
Pokemon back is I think it's like five dollars a year yeah so hopefully it doesn't hopefully

02:37:44.260 --> 02:37:50.740
doesn't like uh go up in price that much but still it will be like a really great service

02:37:50.740 --> 02:37:54.580
hopefully yeah and I'm really curious like the balancing there I mean it sounds like you know

02:37:54.580 --> 02:37:57.860
it's going like you're not like taking stuff and putting it in Pokemon Go or whatever but it

02:37:57.860 --> 02:38:02.740
sounds like Gen 8 is going to kind of account for all that um and before I let you go I'd actually

02:38:02.740 --> 02:38:08.420
like to ask your opinion uh since we know we have a big Pokemon Direct next week focusing on Gen 8

02:38:08.420 --> 02:38:12.660
I'm just kind of curious like what are your hopes and dreams for the Pokemon Direct this coming week

02:38:14.260 --> 02:38:21.700
um my hopes and dreams I hope I hope and I have some really big hopes and dreams for for this but

02:38:22.260 --> 02:38:31.060
mostly I just want the release date and maybe uh some to see some of the new Pokemon on on this uh

02:38:31.060 --> 02:38:38.980
new game certain shield I'm pretty sure you'll get just more info yeah yeah sorry that's fine

02:38:38.980 --> 02:38:42.020
I was gonna say there's probably a lot of things that we just haven't thought about yet but uh the

02:38:42.020 --> 02:38:47.060
Pokemon games tend to have a lot of you know sub games within them so I'm sure we're going to learn

02:38:47.060 --> 02:38:54.100
about a lot of that in the the Pokemon Direct this week so and before I go uh just I want to

02:38:54.100 --> 02:38:58.100
also mention the last thing that they mentioned on the Pokemon conference all right that Pokemon

02:38:58.100 --> 02:39:05.860
Masters game if if anyone that knows like those type of game the gacha games like Fire Emblem

02:39:05.860 --> 02:39:13.860
Heroes Dragalia Lost another many many games of the type if if it works correctly if it if it's

02:39:14.660 --> 02:39:22.660
at least decent this game will explode like you have no idea because if people like are eating

02:39:22.660 --> 02:39:28.180
stuff like Fire Emblem Heroes and Fire Emblem Heroes it's like Fire Emblem isn't that big yet

02:39:28.820 --> 02:39:35.780
it's it's still kind of niche niche uh a niche uh franchise franchise sorry here in America

02:39:35.780 --> 02:39:42.660
Pokemon is gonna blow that up like wow I'm really really excited about that but at the same time I'm

02:39:42.660 --> 02:39:49.540
really worried I I can see that it's always uh it's always scary territory uh especially when

02:39:49.540 --> 02:39:53.700
you know things are like things that are kind of underground are starting to all of a sudden blow

02:39:53.700 --> 02:39:58.660
up but I think it'll I think it'll I think it'll be fine hopefully all right my friend I'm gonna

02:39:58.660 --> 02:40:01.860
let you go so we can squeeze in one more call but thanks so much for the call appreciate it

02:40:01.860 --> 02:40:06.820

not allowed to recap the finale of drag race although you know the right person won yes she

02:40:39.620 --> 02:40:45.700
did but anyway what's on your mind in the gaming world tonight so um I've been lately devouring all

02:40:45.700 --> 02:40:50.420
of the news from the shadowbringers media tour I feel like every time I call in lately it's

02:40:50.420 --> 02:40:55.620
about final fantasy 14 surprise uh but I don't know if you've been following lately but um

02:40:56.260 --> 02:41:00.820
you know they talked about a lot of the changes to like the battle system that they've kind of

02:41:00.820 --> 02:41:08.180
been teasing um they had the live letter that had all those memes about uh you know the sound

02:41:08.180 --> 02:41:14.580
issues and stuff and then they had the media tour so uh you know a lot of people are comparing the

02:41:14.580 --> 02:41:20.660
changes to some of the changes we saw in wow uh you know I don't remember what expansion it was

02:41:20.660 --> 02:41:26.980
but uh one of the things is like the tanks are basically just having a tank stance for

02:41:27.540 --> 02:41:34.820
you know generating aggro but otherwise uh you know a lot of the like enmity rotations are gone

02:41:34.820 --> 02:41:42.820
healing like they took away a lot of the emphasis on dps and I've seen a lot of people like upset

02:41:42.900 --> 02:41:48.580
about it and um feeling like the game's being dumbed down and then especially they have like

02:41:48.580 --> 02:41:53.380
the charged actions which you know we've seen those in wow too so a lot of people feeling like

02:41:53.380 --> 02:41:59.780
it's just you know turning into more and more of a wow clone I'm curious if you're what are your

02:41:59.780 --> 02:42:03.860
thoughts about it I think people should give it a chance we need it we haven't seen how these

02:42:03.860 --> 02:42:08.500
end game raids look like we have I think anytime you got the expansion that goes in there rebalances

02:42:08.500 --> 02:42:13.460
things people get freaked out I mean why is wow classic a thing you know because due to all the

02:42:13.460 --> 02:42:17.940
innovations wow has made people say oh but I I missed the days when it was complicated and you

02:42:17.940 --> 02:42:21.940
had to be level 40 to get a mount and there was weapon skill and now that like blizzard is putting

02:42:21.940 --> 02:42:27.540
out exactly that people are complaining about well these are bugs you know and it's a feature not a

02:42:27.540 --> 02:42:31.940
bug I think I think people should like just feel it out and give it a chance a little bit I think

02:42:31.940 --> 02:42:36.580
especially when it comes to things like you know just making sure that all tank moves get threat

02:42:36.580 --> 02:42:40.500
instead of having to do these basic combos and things like that like the those sorts of things

02:42:40.500 --> 02:42:45.780
make sense to me and that maybe healers right dpsing so much uh those sort of things make sense

02:42:45.780 --> 02:42:51.300
and and a lot of the moves they've been showing uh like the death knights getting clones and the

02:42:51.300 --> 02:42:55.860
astrologians having more zodiac influence things and stuff like a lot of it looks really cool and

02:42:55.860 --> 02:43:03.220
I'm here for it so um yeah I mean you know just as MMOs evolve and update and and want to innovate

02:43:03.220 --> 02:43:07.700
every few years you know these are things that are are going to change um I'm fortunate enough

02:43:07.700 --> 02:43:13.220
that I I know a couple of people that got to go to the media tour and everything everyone that has

02:43:13.220 --> 02:43:17.620
had their hands on it that I've talked to had positive things to say about it so I'm looking

02:43:17.620 --> 02:43:22.020
forward to it as well I was a little salty about fall fantasy 14 when they didn't do the boy bunnies

02:43:22.020 --> 02:43:28.100
but I've had enough time to you know get the fuck over it I suppose maybe next expansion uh and I'm

02:43:28.260 --> 02:43:34.100
excited for the the different job stuff and I think you know a lot of the stuff that isn't getting a

02:43:34.100 --> 02:43:39.140
lot of focus I think is going to be a big deal for some people I know such as the whole trust thing

02:43:39.140 --> 02:43:42.980
and the fact that you can just go through these new dungeons I don't think they work in the old

02:43:42.980 --> 02:43:49.220
dungeons but you can go through the new story for shadowbringers um you can use these trusts to run

02:43:49.220 --> 02:43:52.980
the dungeons with you and you don't have to interact with other people so if you're nervous

02:43:52.980 --> 02:43:57.860
about tanking or healing or something that you know there's one of you and not a lot of room to

02:43:58.660 --> 02:44:01.780
uh if you're nervous about that and you don't want to do that with other people because you're

02:44:01.780 --> 02:44:05.140
afraid you're gonna you know screw up other people's experiences you can do it yourself

02:44:05.140 --> 02:44:10.740
with trust now and I think that's a huge thing for people um so I think there are a lot of great

02:44:10.740 --> 02:44:15.700
things that they're doing um it sounds like there's still more to come because they aren't

02:44:15.700 --> 02:44:21.620
talking about pvp at all have you noticed that and I think they said yeah it's gonna sit on that

02:44:21.620 --> 02:44:28.900
until 5.1 and let everybody experience the pve for a couple months and then get into pvp stuff

02:44:28.900 --> 02:44:33.140
because square's not gonna let that go for final fantasy 14 yet they still would like to see that

02:44:33.140 --> 02:44:38.100
a thing and actually if you do get in there and do the pvp it's really well done it's I've never

02:44:38.100 --> 02:44:44.340
done pvp and uh but I've heard that it's not too um inaccessible that you know it's uh that's

02:44:44.340 --> 02:44:50.580
pretty fun well what's interesting it it dumbs down the rotations you have way less buttons

02:44:50.580 --> 02:44:56.420
that you use in pvp and uh yeah the the matches are are neat like I really like doing the wolves

02:44:56.420 --> 02:45:00.100
den because like you know when you eliminate somebody a big uh thing comes up on the board

02:45:00.100 --> 02:45:05.540
it says little pound cake has eliminated such and such and the metals it's just it's the

02:45:05.540 --> 02:45:09.860
presentation and the pop and circumstance is really well done which you'd expect out of a

02:45:09.860 --> 02:45:14.980
modern final fantasy title I'm sure yeah I mean I think that a lot of the changes seem like really

02:45:14.980 --> 02:45:20.100
good quality of life changes and I think once people get their hands on it they'll be like okay

02:45:20.100 --> 02:45:25.300
I don't know what I was complaining about um in my opinion too where the bar is set with

02:45:25.300 --> 02:45:30.740
final fantasy 14 in the expansion is the story and we don't talk about this enough like realm

02:45:30.740 --> 02:45:35.540
reborn story was okay it was it was good it was passable because you know they had a lot they had

02:45:35.540 --> 02:45:41.460
to do with that game to reinvent what was a shit game uh the 1.0 final fantasy 14 but when we got

02:45:41.460 --> 02:45:48.660
into the expansions heavensward and stormblood like those stories are like some of the best

02:45:48.660 --> 02:45:53.700
if not maybe the best in the in the entire franchise not ever agreed a fan of stormblood

02:45:53.700 --> 02:46:00.420
story like I thought especially I loved it from yeah from 4.0 to 4.1 oh my god like I was shook

02:46:00.420 --> 02:46:05.300
at the ending to stormblood and what they did with that I was like not not this not the four

02:46:05.300 --> 02:46:09.620
five ending but like I don't want to spoil it but there's definitely like a cinematic sequence that

02:46:09.620 --> 02:46:14.580
happens at the end when everybody comes together and I was just like holy shit I was not expecting

02:46:14.580 --> 02:46:22.180
that but that was powerful you know yeah right mm-hmm so yeah so before I uh let you wrap things

02:46:22.180 --> 02:46:30.500
up um knowing that you got your start with vdr and bimani and everything are you like totally

02:46:30.500 --> 02:46:35.700
thrilled that there's almost a rhythm game element to playing dancer with all the little steps and

02:46:35.700 --> 02:46:41.460
stuff uh it reminds me of that suzaku fight where you have the little arrows you have to kind of

02:46:41.540 --> 02:46:44.820
turn around yeah I think it's cute I think it's cute that they have a little bit of the rhythm

02:46:44.820 --> 02:46:48.660
game influence in there uh with the dancer I don't know if you know this but um it's kind of

02:46:48.660 --> 02:46:54.260
like ninjas with the is it easy to dancer it's I see what you did there but yeah you hit these

02:46:54.260 --> 02:46:59.060
little you hit these little notes or you hit these little uh keys in time with something and it's it

02:46:59.060 --> 02:47:06.660
does the actions it's funny I'm totally gonna play dancer but not at first but everybody's gonna play

02:47:06.660 --> 02:47:12.340
dancer at first and I'm gonna focus on my healer I'm not and then uh get into you know actually

02:47:12.340 --> 02:47:18.580
what I really want to play is machinist because yeah changed machinist so now come on automaton

02:47:18.580 --> 02:47:25.300
queen yeah final fantasy 14 machinist is now like edgar in final fantasy 6 yeah and they even

02:47:25.300 --> 02:47:31.460
showed the poison the was like is a move that you can do and I was like dang this is cool so I'm

02:47:31.540 --> 02:47:37.380
really excited about that yeah myself is the only final fantasy 8 fanboy in the world basically

02:47:38.180 --> 02:47:44.420
I'm totally here for gunbreaker it looks super fun and uh yeah yeah I can't wait so I'll see you in

02:47:44.420 --> 02:47:48.180
game yeah I can't believe the expansion is the end of this month it's sooner rather than later

02:47:48.180 --> 02:47:52.340
it's just really exciting so all right my friend I'm gonna let you go so we can wrap up but

02:47:52.340 --> 02:47:56.660

02:48:23.860 --> 02:48:27.860

sacramento happy pride month happy pride I didn't go to the extent it's spelled june but it's

02:49:08.500 --> 02:49:13.140
pronounced pride I I didn't go to the extent to make a rainbow background or anything like that

02:49:13.140 --> 02:49:21.060
because like if y'all have y'all put up with my rainbow ass for 17 years I'm you know but

02:49:21.060 --> 02:49:29.380
remember fight by erasure fight pan erasure fight ace erasure yes rainbow means variety means more

02:49:29.380 --> 02:49:35.780
than one thing means there are more than six colors in that rainbow all right anyway uh but

02:49:35.780 --> 02:49:40.660
happy pride month nonetheless to everybody um that's it I think we're gonna wrap up get around

02:49:44.020 --> 02:49:47.220
look at the bottom look at the bottom of that yeah right it has a little I don't know if that comes

02:49:47.220 --> 02:49:50.500
through on twitch very well I'll get up I'll get up towards the cam while you're doing your final

02:49:50.500 --> 02:49:54.340
thought it actually has like the railings and all that stuff girl I need one let me show you why

02:49:54.340 --> 02:49:57.780
don't you do your final thought and then loki does his and I'll show the twitch listeners do a final

02:49:57.780 --> 02:50:05.300
thought because my head is too herdy like because I have had like the the sickness of the the con

02:50:05.300 --> 02:50:12.740
crud and the allergenus yeah you can kind of see it on there barely it's enough it's enough extreme

02:50:13.620 --> 02:50:21.620
but um but I I have the pain of the centuries in my head because my head is full of is a

02:50:21.620 --> 02:50:27.220
nightmare of snot and tiny jackhammers all right well feel better I'm I'm right there with you

02:50:27.220 --> 02:50:32.180
suffering with the the Chicago plague or what I think there's just cold going around everywhere so

02:50:32.180 --> 02:50:38.340
yeah but you know how to well not just con crud but being around Disneyland sure and me on an

02:50:38.340 --> 02:50:44.260
airplane so similar um but man if you've never done solo Disney fucking do it let's see my

02:50:44.260 --> 02:50:52.500
final thought for the night is um I am just I it's I was very very busy all of the weekends

02:50:52.500 --> 02:50:56.500
and during the weekend stuff leading up to my Chicago trip just by coincidence and now

02:50:56.500 --> 02:51:00.500
I feel like I don't have as busy of a social calendar and I think that's a good thing I'm

02:51:00.500 --> 02:51:04.900
gonna take some time I'm gonna take some me time and maybe go I'm gonna I'm gonna take some

02:51:04.900 --> 02:51:09.060
inspiration from your solo Disney trip and maybe maybe I'm gonna go on a solo road trip and go

02:51:09.060 --> 02:51:13.380
hiking or something I think that'll be a lot of fun you know what would be fun though manny

02:51:13.380 --> 02:51:20.020
petties that would also be a lot of fun anyway uh Loki your final thought tonight uh my final

02:51:20.020 --> 02:51:26.660
thought is that I'm gonna try to stream some more DDR this week I haven't been streaming every day

02:51:26.660 --> 02:51:31.860
that I play because sometimes I just also want to just get 30 minutes in and then actually do

02:51:31.860 --> 02:51:36.820
weightlifting this week though I did weightlifting after not doing weightlifting for a very long time

02:51:36.820 --> 02:51:42.020
and I fucked up my arms for like the entire week so they're unfucked now so I get to uh

02:51:43.140 --> 02:51:48.180
do it all over again watch watch your form just watch your form I need to get back in the gym

02:51:48.180 --> 02:51:52.580
habit very bad I fell off that wagon you know with everything going on and then I'm sick I haven't

02:51:52.580 --> 02:51:56.820
been able to go since I got back from Chicago so I'm really trying to get back on that I got told

02:51:56.820 --> 02:52:00.980
not to weight lift I was I got the okay to go back into powerlifting because you know I was

02:52:01.060 --> 02:52:06.900
powerlifting before I hurt my back I got up to like a deadlift of 200 and then with the problems with

02:52:06.900 --> 02:52:12.020
my neck I got told to hold off on my powerlifting until my neck is dealt with oh wow so I'm very

02:52:12.020 --> 02:52:19.140
upset by this because I like being able to to deadlift 200 pounds and watch guys like lose their

02:52:19.140 --> 02:52:24.820
shit all right well hopefully you'll be clear do it again in the future anyway uh that's gonna do
