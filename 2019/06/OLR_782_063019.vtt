Radio Hosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

00:27.000 --> 00:32.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:32.000 --> 00:37.000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:37.000 --> 00:45.000
It is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight with episode number 782 for this June the 30th of 2019.

00:45.000 --> 00:50.000
My name is Rob Roberts and joining me tonight, Techmaster Loki here in studio.

00:50.000 --> 00:51.000
Hello.

00:51.000 --> 00:52.000
Hi, how are you?

00:52.000 --> 00:53.000
I'm very full.

00:53.000 --> 00:54.000
You're very full?

00:54.000 --> 00:58.000
Yes, I had some katsudon before the show started.

00:58.000 --> 01:01.000
It looked like a baby threw up in that plate and you ate it.

01:01.000 --> 01:04.000
It looked much better on Friday when it had the same thing.

01:04.000 --> 01:14.000
It's supposed to be just like pork cutlets that are breaded and fried and then they do onions and carrots and then there's a scrambled egg over the top.

01:14.000 --> 01:20.000
All that smelly stuff and I'm surprised, Mr. Smoosh, my dear kitty is not out here going meow meow meow and smelling all that stuff.

01:20.000 --> 01:25.000
But seriously, it looked like my cat had vomited into rice and then that was what I was eating.

01:25.000 --> 01:26.000
But it was delicious vomit.

01:26.000 --> 01:31.000
Sometimes food that doesn't look appetizing actually ends up being really freaking appetizing.

01:31.000 --> 01:32.000
It is good.

01:32.000 --> 01:40.000
It's so good that I've been craving it since I had it on Friday and so I bought some today and then I also bought the stuff to make it at home for this week.

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
So, are we having it again?

01:42.000 --> 01:43.000
I don't know.

01:43.000 --> 01:44.000
Alright.

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
Well, it's a little bit of a weird show tonight.

01:46.000 --> 01:49.000
Not joining us tonight is Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers.

01:49.000 --> 01:50.000
She has the night off.

01:50.000 --> 01:52.000
She is attending San Francisco Pride.

01:52.000 --> 02:01.000
As she's mentioned on the show before, she's a member of the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence and this is a big, big weekend for the sisters, certainly in Northern California as well as other places.

02:01.000 --> 02:04.000
So, there was a lot of Pride celebrations around the world this weekend.

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
So, I know I said it at the beginning of the month, but you know what?

02:06.000 --> 02:07.000
I'll say it one more time here.

02:07.000 --> 02:11.000
At the end of the month, these things are winding down with the celebrations.

02:11.000 --> 02:13.000
Happy Pride to everybody out there.

02:13.000 --> 02:18.000
And yeah, you know, it's one of those things that hopefully doesn't go away once June is over.

02:18.000 --> 02:26.000
But I think we've made a lot of wonderful, wonderful progress in the past 50 years since Stonewall, but there's still so much further to go.

02:26.000 --> 02:32.000
I'm going to try not to soapbox too much tonight because I know we want to get into video games, but that is certainly on my mind a lot.

02:32.000 --> 02:35.000
So, Dark Sakura will be joining us again next week.

02:35.000 --> 02:38.000
And Jason, you may have noticed, was absent from the intro.

02:38.000 --> 02:45.000
So, you've got a very rare, I can't, it's been years since we've had one of these intros because, and I'll tell you why I didn't do it either.

02:45.000 --> 02:48.000
So, Jason, he was at the Summer Games down quick.

02:48.000 --> 02:49.000
Yeah.

02:49.000 --> 02:52.000
So, he was, he's traveling today because that just wrapped up.

02:52.000 --> 02:55.000
So, he's, we will talk about that later in the show.

02:55.000 --> 02:59.000
I know many of you were watching and I do have a spot to talk about later in the show, don't worry.

02:59.000 --> 03:04.000
And Jason's traveling, so he was unable to do, he kind of was at a spot.

03:04.000 --> 03:11.000
He thought he might be at a spot where he kind of like pull over, record it, but he kind of couldn't do it because I got him the stuff late because,

03:11.000 --> 03:15.000
and I couldn't do it because I was out of town last night. I went to a concert.

03:15.000 --> 03:23.000
So, I went to see Carly Slay Jepsen, who I think a lot of people probably, I don't know, some people know, some people don't.

03:23.000 --> 03:27.000
But Carly Rae Jepsen is, I think she got big through Canadian Idol.

03:27.000 --> 03:33.000
I don't know if I want to say she's like the Kelly Clarkson of Canada because I'm opening myself up to Well Actuallys.

03:33.000 --> 03:38.000
But she's had a pretty good career ever since she did Canadian Idol. Her biggest hit was Call Me Maybe.

03:38.000 --> 03:41.000
That song got memed to hell, right? Everybody had that whole thing.

03:41.000 --> 03:47.000
But the thing, the gag is, if you actually listen to some of her later stuff, like some of her other albums like Emotion and stuff,

03:47.000 --> 03:53.000
like for me, like there's some really like solid like pop like anthems on there. It's really like infectious.

03:53.000 --> 03:59.000
Like it's just kind of like, oh. So, it was good. It was like a late birthday present because my birthday obviously was this past week.

03:59.000 --> 04:04.000
Allen's is coming up. So, we splurged. We did VIP. We got to do the meet and greet.

04:04.000 --> 04:09.000
So, she was really sweet and all that. It was great. She complimented my shirt.

04:09.000 --> 04:13.000
Not this one, obviously, but I was wearing one with cats on it. So, she thought it was cool.

04:13.000 --> 04:18.000
So, yeah, that was my little Carly Rae story. So, but that was in Reno.

04:18.000 --> 04:24.000
So, we drove up to Reno to do that. We could have gone to San Francisco, but I figured with pride in San Francisco this weekend,

04:24.000 --> 04:31.000
that means traffic. That means impossible to park. Whereas, I'm thinking in Reno, I'm like all the casinos have free parking

04:31.000 --> 04:36.000
because they want you to go there. And sure enough, it was easy peasy going to Reno.

04:36.000 --> 04:43.000
So, in the theater, they did it out there as brand new. So, long story short, I was in Reno up until like a few hours ago.

04:43.000 --> 04:47.000
We got back from Reno. So, I had to kind of abbreviate my show prep tonight.

04:47.000 --> 04:56.000
So, speaking of concerts, Bobby Blackwolf, who's usually on before us at the Voice Geeks Network at vognetwork.com

04:56.000 --> 05:01.000
because we do tape every night. No, we do not tape every night. We'd be tired.

05:01.000 --> 05:08.000
We do tape every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Blackwolf show usually.

05:08.000 --> 05:14.000
But he is off this week because he is at a Weird Al Yankovic concert.

05:14.000 --> 05:19.000
So, I have Carly Rae Jefferson. He has Weird Al Yankovic. But I think Weird Al is really cool.

05:19.000 --> 05:24.000
And honestly, a worthy reason to miss the show for a night. He's earned a night off.

05:24.000 --> 05:29.000
So, that's where he's at tonight. So, he didn't have a show tonight. So, yeah, it's like a weird night all over the place.

05:29.000 --> 05:36.000
Like three people usually involved with Sunday nights are gone MIA. I almost kind of decided to call off the show tonight.

05:36.000 --> 05:42.000
But you know I don't like missing a lot of shows. I feel like there's enough for us to talk about with you guys in our chatroom

05:42.000 --> 05:46.000
over at twitch.tv slash vog network.

05:46.000 --> 05:51.000
Dartutuja says, it didn't seem like there was too much news anyway, at least outside the GDQ stuff.

05:51.000 --> 05:57.000
Yeah, it does seem like things are really quiet this week. And I don't know if that's still kind of like the post E3 kind of slumber or what's going on there.

05:57.000 --> 06:04.000
I think it's post E3 because we're just a few weeks away from what was it?

06:04.000 --> 06:10.000
Gamescom, which is another like big announcement space. So, you know, I don't want to like announce too much stuff in between then

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
because then when are you going to announce it? Gamescom.

06:12.000 --> 06:18.000
Plus a lot of stuff has just like come out. You know, now we're kind of getting into that summer release window

06:18.000 --> 06:22.000
because you know the schools everywhere I'm from, it's a good time to release games.

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
But it's actually really light usually.

06:24.000 --> 06:29.000
I feel like I'm so behind right now. Like I have not played nearly as many games as I should be.

06:29.000 --> 06:36.000
And I'll get into why that is a little later. But I know Bloodstained came out and I need to get on that, that's for sure.

06:36.000 --> 06:41.000
I have my Switch version, although I've heard there's some issues. We'll talk about that later in the show.

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
Mario Maker 2 for sure.

06:43.000 --> 06:46.000
I did pick that up. I haven't played it. My kids played it.

06:46.000 --> 06:49.000
Tell us more later during the game week.

06:49.000 --> 06:52.000
And then what else? There's another one that came out.

06:52.000 --> 06:57.000
Oh, Final Fantasy XIV's expansion, which I suppose will lead us into tonight's kickoff topic.

06:57.000 --> 07:00.000
So Final Fantasy XIV's expansion released this week.

07:00.000 --> 07:04.000
So Shadowbringers is the brand new expansion and it launched.

07:04.000 --> 07:09.000
I guess the early access happened on Friday and technically the game's actual launch is Tuesday.

07:09.000 --> 07:18.000
But for most MMO players, I'm pretty sure the Final Fantasy XIV fans, a big majority of them preordered Shadowbringers.

07:18.000 --> 07:21.000
Just because they know they're going to buy it anyway is where I'm at.

07:21.000 --> 07:25.000
And so you have that three or four day early access into Shadowbringers.

07:25.000 --> 07:33.000
So it's been up since Friday. It sounds like it hasn't had quite the chaotic issues that some of the other launches had for Final Fantasy XIV.

07:33.000 --> 07:38.000
So that's been a good thing. Like there was not errors where people were trying to get into a cutscene and they couldn't.

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
Because that was a big thing that happened with Stormblood.

07:40.000 --> 07:45.000
It does sound like the servers got DDoSed at one point, or at least that's what Square Enix claims happens.

07:45.000 --> 07:48.000
So there was some problems there. Some big login queues.

07:48.000 --> 07:52.000
But, you know, kind of, I guess par for the course with MMO launches.

07:52.000 --> 07:56.000
I suppose as far as most MMO launches go, it could have been a lot worse.

07:56.000 --> 08:01.000
And then, and we'll get into more on Final Fantasy XIV here in a minute.

08:01.000 --> 08:06.000
But speaking of the game releases, the Harry Potter game a lot of people are still talking about.

08:06.000 --> 08:09.000
I know we went into that in depth last week and I don't want to rehash too much.

08:09.000 --> 08:13.000
But I know a lot of people are still, you know, out there finding the foundables.

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
Finding the findables.

08:15.000 --> 08:18.000
And some of my friends in Reno that I hung out with this weekend.

08:18.000 --> 08:23.000
So the other reason why it was nice to go to Reno is because I have friends up there that I don't get to see as often as maybe the ones in San Francisco.

08:23.000 --> 08:27.000
So I went up to Reno and one of my friends there was like, oh yeah, I'm playing that Harry Potter game. I love it.

08:27.000 --> 08:35.000
And I mentioned that I played Ingress and I was like, you have like a little picnic area like right by where you live that probably would be in Ingress.

08:35.000 --> 08:38.000
Do you want me to submit that so you have like a Harry Potter thing by your house?

08:38.000 --> 08:41.000
He's like, oh my gosh, yes, would you? So I did. I sent it.

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
So we'll see if it goes, fingers crossed, if it goes through or not.

08:43.000 --> 08:52.000
But yeah, he's all into the Harry Potter game, which is interesting because I thought most people were kind of just detouring from Pokemon Go for that.

08:52.000 --> 08:56.000
But I don't know, maybe Harry Potter has its own audience. I'm not sure.

08:56.000 --> 08:59.000
Probably. There's still a lot of crossover, I would think.

08:59.000 --> 09:03.000
Harry Potter had a big event on Saturday though, but so did Pokemon Go.

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
So Harry Potter had an event in the morning.

09:05.000 --> 09:12.000
Like, I don't think, I don't know if I would call it their version of a community day, but they did a little thing for a few hours where it was like increased spawns and all this stuff.

09:12.000 --> 09:17.000
And then Pokemon Go had their Raikou raids because we could see them go.

09:17.000 --> 09:22.000
We were like at the casino, like waiting to get into the VIP thing for Carly Rae.

09:22.000 --> 09:26.000
And we could see like, you could see the gyms like on the outside of the casino, but they were nowhere near us.

09:26.000 --> 09:29.000
And we're like, well, guess we're missing Raikou day.

09:29.000 --> 09:33.000
But it sounds like a lot more people were getting shinies, like they increased the percentage.

09:33.000 --> 09:36.000
I know I was keeping an eye on our Discord at vognetwork.com slash Discord.

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
We actually have a Pokemon Go channel because enough of you play it.

09:38.000 --> 09:43.000
And I was like, a lot of people were saying they've got multiple shinies on the Raikou days. That's cool.

09:43.000 --> 09:48.000
I just feel like I feel like I'm getting that point where I'm like, oh, I'm slipping on Pokemon Go and I'm falling behind.

09:48.000 --> 09:54.000
And I don't know if it's like, am I going to allow myself to just completely fall off the wagon or what's going to happen?

09:54.000 --> 09:59.000
And the fact that Harry Potter is like the new kid on the block doesn't help that situation.

09:59.000 --> 10:00.000
I don't know.

10:01.000 --> 10:04.000
ActDeftInChat says, a friend in our group didn't get a shiny though.

10:04.000 --> 10:07.000
Well, but isn't that why the rest of you get three and four shinies?

10:07.000 --> 10:09.000
Like, so you can trade?

10:09.000 --> 10:12.000
I mean, maybe not right away, maybe the next, because what?

10:12.000 --> 10:15.000
They're going to do one for the fire guy and the ice guy, right?

10:15.000 --> 10:18.000
I know you have to meet certain criteria, but they're going to do it.

10:18.000 --> 10:19.000
You know, they're going to do it.

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
They'll find a way to do it.

10:21.000 --> 10:26.000
So then the concept is, I guess, if you don't get any of the fire guy, but then your friend gets three of those, you trade.

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
That's what Pokemon is all about, right?

10:28.000 --> 10:29.000
Yeah.

10:29.000 --> 10:33.000
Hopefully someone will take pity on me and trade a Riku to me at some point.

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
I'm not, I'm getting to the point where I'm not that torn up about it.

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
I'm like, Oh, damn, I missed it.

10:37.000 --> 10:40.000
Those shinies are just taking up my inventory space anyway.

10:40.000 --> 10:41.000
All right.

10:41.000 --> 10:42.000
Anyway.

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
Well, you can get your shinies for the Lowens right now, can't you?

10:44.000 --> 10:45.000
Yeah.

10:45.000 --> 10:46.000
That's the whole thing going on too.

10:46.000 --> 10:52.000
Anyway, it was supposed to be a kickoff about Final Fantasy 14, but it turned into multiplayer game discussion across the board.

10:52.000 --> 10:55.000
So it's, I mean, in a way it is a busy summer.

10:55.000 --> 11:04.000
These are things that people are doing this summer and maybe why the news is not so like, you know, huge headlines, you know, things we have to urgently talk about.

11:04.000 --> 11:09.000
But we have a few stories this week about, um, games going to TV.

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
So do you want to take this or you want me to do it?

11:11.000 --> 11:12.000
We can talk about it.

11:12.000 --> 11:18.000
So Sony announced that they're going to be bringing Final Fantasy 14 to TV as like a Final Fantasy TV series.

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
That's kind of unexpected.

11:21.000 --> 11:22.000
Yeah.

11:22.000 --> 11:25.000
Like I'm, I'm really pleasantly surprised about this.

11:25.000 --> 11:31.000
I'm curious to see what it's like, but, um, I definitely wasn't expecting them to do that.

11:31.000 --> 11:41.000
So it's going to be, I guess, a collaboration between Sony Pictures Television and Hive Mind Entertainment, which has done, or is going to be doing the adaptation of The Witcher.

11:41.000 --> 11:46.000
And I guess there's a show called The Expanse on Amazon that they also helm as well.

11:46.000 --> 11:47.000
Oh, that show.

11:47.000 --> 11:50.000
There's a lot of nerdy geeky fans of that show.

11:50.000 --> 11:51.000
I see a lot of it on Twitter.

11:51.000 --> 11:57.000
Um, don't they have nudity on that show in The Expanse or am I confusing them with another show?

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
Somebody in chat knows.

11:59.000 --> 12:00.000
Fess up.

12:00.000 --> 12:05.000
It's going to be so much shipping on the Final Fantasy show.

12:05.000 --> 12:06.000
I know.

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
I'm like, you can do anything we want.

12:08.000 --> 12:09.000
It's Netflix.

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
Well, I don't even know if it's going to be on Netflix.

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
It didn't say what platform they're playing.

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
I might be confusing them with another sci-fi show.

12:15.000 --> 12:16.000
Uh, but, you know.

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
Are we going to get outed as a total perv?

12:18.000 --> 12:27.000
Uh, yeah, no real word other than, you know, what it's, it's going to be a struggle between magic and technology.

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
All the games, basically.

12:29.000 --> 12:32.000
Uh, to bring peace to a landing conflict.

12:32.000 --> 12:33.000
All of the games.

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
It's basically like all of the games.

12:35.000 --> 12:41.000
Um, Tiger Claw in our chat says a live action series to be exact, and I think that is an important thing to note.

12:41.000 --> 12:43.000
That is not CGI or cartoon or something.

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
That is a live action series.

12:45.000 --> 12:53.000
Um, and a lot of people talking about, oh, they've kind of done one already with the Dad of Light series that is on, um, Netflix.

12:53.000 --> 13:01.000
But in that show, and disclaimer, I haven't watched it, but, you know, just kind of been following what it was all about and the stories on that and the people that have seen it.

13:01.000 --> 13:08.000
My understanding is that Final Fantasy XIV is a little bit more of a plot device where the show is really about this father and son relationship.

13:08.000 --> 13:14.000
But the game is something that they kind of use to understand their own relationship.

13:14.000 --> 13:18.000
Whereas this is different because this is the game as a show.

13:18.000 --> 13:21.000
This is not a plot device for something else.

13:21.000 --> 13:26.000
And it's great because then maybe I'll understand what's going on with Final Fantasy XIV and then I can play the game, right?

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
Is that, that's the goal.

13:28.000 --> 13:32.000
Okay, so we obviously have two very different kind of, you know, between you and I tonight.

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
I play a lot of Final Fantasy XIV.

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
I played shitty 1.0.

13:36.000 --> 13:40.000
I've played since the alpha of Realm Reborn and so forth.

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
And I've continued to play the game and I really enjoy it.

13:42.000 --> 13:45.000
Um, you played very little of the beta.

13:45.000 --> 13:49.000
Yeah, you played very little of the beta because you were a big fan of XI.

13:49.000 --> 13:53.000
But you were like, no more monthly fee games pretty much, right?

13:53.000 --> 13:56.000
Yeah, I can't really do that because it's just, I don't play enough.

13:56.000 --> 14:04.000
And I think there's a lot of people in your boat where like people are like, I would play Final Fantasy XIV if I didn't have to pay every month to play it.

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
I think there's a lot of people in that boat.

14:06.000 --> 14:12.000
Um, but I can tell you as somebody who does play the game and I kind of justify the monthly fee.

14:12.000 --> 14:22.000
Although I realize it's feeling a little more dated as, you know, we have so much more like free to play stuff with it's powered by, you know, cosmetic items and things like that.

14:22.000 --> 14:30.000
But I kind of justify the monthly expense because I feel like they've been really good about regularly patching the content like every few months.

14:30.000 --> 14:33.000
It's like you get this new DLC if you want to say it that way.

14:33.000 --> 14:38.000
They call it patches in the MMO world, especially new dungeons, new things to explore, new parts of the story.

14:38.000 --> 14:41.000
So it's like they're doing DLC every few months.

14:41.000 --> 14:44.000
And so I go, okay, well, it's expensive DLC, but I'm kind of paying for that.

14:44.000 --> 14:48.000
And just the fact that, you know, it isn't always online game.

14:48.000 --> 14:58.000
But to that effect though, so are a lot of these other games as service games like Destiny 2 and stuff like that are doing regular content updates as well.

14:58.000 --> 15:01.000
So it's like it's not really exclusive to them.

15:01.000 --> 15:07.000
I would also just rather pay the honest, you know, twelve ninety five or whatever.

15:07.000 --> 15:10.000
I'm actually paying quarterly, so I don't even know how much I pay, but whatever it is a monthly.

15:10.000 --> 15:19.000
I would rather pay that honest fee up front than like get fucked over by loot boxes like the last Star Wars battle.

15:19.000 --> 15:23.000
So, yeah, I would rather it just be an honest like this is how much we want to charge.

15:23.000 --> 15:26.000
See, if it was an EA game, they'd be charging at twelve ninety five a month.

15:26.000 --> 15:29.000
Plus the loot boxes as well in there.

15:29.000 --> 15:37.000
Black Mama 1977 in our chat with a sad but important point that they never finished out of light because the dad in the show passed away.

15:37.000 --> 15:40.000
And, you know, so, you know, that show can't really continue.

15:40.000 --> 15:43.000
You know, I highly doubt they're going to continue it with a different actor or anything.

15:43.000 --> 15:46.000
So it's time to go somewhere else with Final Fantasy 14.

15:46.000 --> 15:49.000
But again, you know, this is going to be something that's actually set in the universe.

15:49.000 --> 15:54.000
And so but it is not an adaptation of the story in game right now, is my understanding.

15:54.000 --> 15:58.000
It's going to be in the universe, but it's going to be like a different story.

15:58.000 --> 16:02.000
And I don't know if it's like prequel or any of that.

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
I don't know if they're saying a lot about that.

16:04.000 --> 16:09.000
Act deft and chat over Twitch TV slash Vogue Network is very excited about live action chocobos.

16:09.000 --> 16:13.000
So I know that's that's a thing that people be looking for.

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
Well, it's all going to be like CG stuff.

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
I mean, they're going to. Sure.

16:17.000 --> 16:23.000
We have like the computer anime movie that they did for 13 not too long goes.

16:23.000 --> 16:27.000
Oh, no, 15, not 13, 15.

16:27.000 --> 16:33.000
So, yeah, the CGI technology is there to have real people writing, you know, the fake chocobos.

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
They're not going to do it all the time.

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
It's going to be one of those like big moments in the show.

16:37.000 --> 16:40.000
And then they're not going to have people writing chocobos like all the time.

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
I doubt we'll see. I don't know.

16:42.000 --> 16:45.000
I'd be curious to see what service this is going to be on.

16:45.000 --> 16:50.000
Oh, if you think it's going to end up being a Netflix thing or heaven forbid, is Sony going to launch their own service?

16:50.000 --> 16:53.000
Well, they have crackle, right? Or whatever it is they have.

16:53.000 --> 16:59.000
Well, not as a crackle, but they have like they're they've tried to do TV shows on the PlayStation stuff before.

16:59.000 --> 17:07.000
Remember, there's the whole that was it the tester was that was called or I don't I can't see this being a PlayStation Network exclusive.

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
It's just not going to get enough eyes unless.

17:09.000 --> 17:12.000
OK, y'all y'all want a tinfoil hat.

17:12.000 --> 17:21.000
What if they're doing something with PlayStation five where they're going to as much as the whole like TV, TV, TV, sports, sports, TV, TV.

17:21.000 --> 17:22.000
And look how well that worked for Microsoft.

17:22.000 --> 17:26.000
But what if they're kind of planning to do something on PlayStation five?

17:26.000 --> 17:34.000
Where maybe this will be one of the offerings that they put out there, like if you get a PlayStation five, you have access to Sony TV.

17:34.000 --> 17:40.000
That's going to have these other shows like now a PlayStation plus included with your plus membership.

17:40.000 --> 17:50.000
And then my reaction will be, oh, no, I can only watch it if I buy a PlayStation five, except the Internet exists, and therefore I will pirate it.

17:50.000 --> 17:55.000
Or like what's happening to Star Trek Discovery in other countries.

17:55.000 --> 18:00.000
It's on Netflix, so they don't have to worry about the whole CBS all access thing like we do here in the States.

18:01.000 --> 18:12.000
The second season, which I haven't finished, but the second season is like apparently like if you thought the first season was not Star Trek enough, the second season will address your concerns.

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
That's what I'm told without sounding.

18:14.000 --> 18:18.000
I don't know. I've seen some clips that look pretty cringy.

18:18.000 --> 18:21.000
OK, but you can go back to old Star Trek and there's a lot of clips that look really cringy.

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
Yeah, but there's different there's different cringe.

18:23.000 --> 18:27.000
There's cringe like, you know, it's old and that's kind of how we did things and stuff.

18:27.000 --> 18:35.000
Then there's cringe like where we're taking CSI type, you know, technobabble and throwing it into Star Trek.

18:35.000 --> 18:36.000
And it's just weird.

18:36.000 --> 18:39.000
It's always the starboard power coupling. Am I right, guys?

18:39.000 --> 18:40.000
I read that show. All right.

18:40.000 --> 18:45.000
Some other comments from chat pod culture reminding us Powers was the other show on PlayStation.

18:45.000 --> 18:48.000
That was the year I was at Sony's press conference, the year they unveiled that.

18:48.000 --> 18:49.000
I should know that better.

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
That's right. Yeah, I didn't care about that.

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
Yeah, I think a lot of people forgot about that.

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
Oops. Let's see.

18:55.000 --> 19:00.000
Also, Tiger Claw talking about the Final Fantasy 14 show in our chat saying, I'm curious about the production value.

19:00.000 --> 19:04.000
It's going to be live action, but there will be CGI in it for sure.

19:04.000 --> 19:11.000
Well, you know, I think, you know, like what they did in 1993 or four,

19:11.000 --> 19:16.000
whatever it was with Jurassic Park is much easier to do for a lot of people now.

19:16.000 --> 19:20.000
I mean, the best example I could say is like, look at those Sharknado movies.

19:20.000 --> 19:25.000
OK, those Sharknado movies are extremely low budget, right?

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
Yet they do CGI effects.

19:27.000 --> 19:31.000
Well, OK, let's not say it's going to be that bad CGI.

19:31.000 --> 19:32.000
They could do it.

19:32.000 --> 19:39.000
There's I think now it's easier to do a lot of that stuff and you can make the effects look better,

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
but you can't also rely heavily on it.

19:41.000 --> 19:44.000
You have to have good writing as well.

19:44.000 --> 19:49.000
So I think that we're probably in for a pretty decent show and it's a pretty exciting.

19:49.000 --> 19:55.000
We've got this The Witcher. There's that Rainbow or was it a Ghost Recon

19:55.000 --> 19:58.000
or Rainbow Six show that was supposed to be coming out or something like that.

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
Oh, yeah. Tom Clancy.

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
Yeah. I mean, it's pretty exciting.

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
They were getting all these like video game properties.

20:04.000 --> 20:09.000
Not Sonic, but all the other stuff is very exciting.

20:09.000 --> 20:12.000
I mean, we just had like Detective Pikachu and that was an amazing show.

20:12.000 --> 20:16.000
I will still watch Sonic, but my bar is really low.

20:16.000 --> 20:20.000
Have you ever seen that meme that's like the nine squares?

20:20.000 --> 20:21.000
Yes.

20:21.000 --> 20:23.000
And it goes like, thank you for.

20:23.000 --> 20:24.000
So I feel like you're setting up.

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
That's exactly what I was thinking.

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
Where it's like Final Fantasy 14.

20:28.000 --> 20:34.000
Thank and then like maybe the new Tomb Raider movie you for bringing video games in that center square.

20:34.000 --> 20:37.000
Not you with the Sonic.

20:37.000 --> 20:38.000
You guys know that meme I'm talking about.

20:38.000 --> 20:39.000
Yes, I know.

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
I know exactly what you mean.

20:41.000 --> 20:42.000
And that's exactly what I was thinking.

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
Not you.

20:44.000 --> 20:47.000
Yeah, pretty much.

20:47.000 --> 20:48.000
It'll you know what?

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
I will enjoy it for what it is.

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
I'm sure it's going to be absolute garbage.

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
And I love I can't wait.

20:54.000 --> 20:55.000
They pushed it back.

20:55.000 --> 20:56.000
It's going to be tweaked.

20:56.000 --> 20:57.000
Let's give it a let's give it.

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
I want it to be absolute garbage.

20:59.000 --> 21:04.000
It needs to be absolute garbage because that's going to make it super entertaining.

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
All right. Anyway, a few more notes of Final Fantasy 14.

21:06.000 --> 21:07.000
Then we'll move on.

21:07.000 --> 21:15.000
I do think that, you know, I completely respect why people don't want to pay the monthly fee to play Final Fantasy 14.

21:15.000 --> 21:18.000
Especially if they don't have as many hours in the day to be able to play the game.

21:18.000 --> 21:23.000
So they feel like I'm wasting my money because it's maybe something I'm only going to be able to play on the weekend or something.

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
But I will say this.

21:25.000 --> 21:29.000
The story in Final Fantasy 14 is really good.

21:29.000 --> 21:37.000
I to be fair, I don't think it really gets really good until you kind of get up to like the end of Realm Reborn.

21:37.000 --> 21:46.000
Because I do feel like the game kind of has to get through like the leveling process where you get to level 50 and like a lot of tutorial and set up and, you know, learning about this mechanic and that mechanic.

21:46.000 --> 21:49.000
And so it does feel like you're doing a lot of fetch quests and stuff.

21:49.000 --> 21:56.000
But once you start to get into the part after they had to fix what was broken and get into our new shit.

21:56.000 --> 22:03.000
And they did that with the end of Realm Reborn and they especially did that with Heaven's Word and Stormblood.

22:03.000 --> 22:08.000
And I'm assuming this new one. I haven't played enough, you know, if the story is phenomenal yet.

22:08.000 --> 22:12.000
But, you know, Heaven's Word and Stormblood are excellent stories.

22:12.000 --> 22:16.000
Like honestly, in my opinion, some may disagree and I've said this before.

22:16.000 --> 22:22.000
Heaven's Word and Stormblood are some of the strongest Final Fantasy stories in the entire series.

22:23.000 --> 22:27.000
And hardly any of you know it because that monthly fee holds you back.

22:27.000 --> 22:29.000
Which again, I completely understand.

22:29.000 --> 22:33.000
And I know it's unreasonable because I pay like small monthly fees for a whole bunch of shit.

22:33.000 --> 22:36.000
And so it's like, what's one more thing?

22:36.000 --> 22:45.000
I mean, it's just, I don't want to feel tied down to playing one game all the time when I don't have enough time to play all of the games that I have in my backlog.

22:45.000 --> 22:50.000
So it's like, you know, I would feel obligated to play that one game so much.

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
Now, SSTO 100 Matt in chat says,

22:52.000 --> 23:06.000
It's truly an amazing, I'm assuming an amazing accomplishment, that a game that needed to completely wipe and reset after a bad initial release was able to come back from it to become a fantastic game that is now being considered for a live action series.

23:06.000 --> 23:09.000
Speaks to how much of an amazing comeback story this has been.

23:09.000 --> 23:14.000
Oh, absolutely. And the comeback kid is like this new thing in video games, right?

23:14.000 --> 23:19.000
You know, between this and Diablo 3 and Destiny to some extent.

23:19.000 --> 23:27.000
And I think what EA would really wish would happen to Anthem, but, you know, they're going to need to back it up a little bit, but we'll see.

23:27.000 --> 23:29.000
Here's the problem, EA. You're EA.

23:29.000 --> 23:32.000
Oh, No Man's Sky. Thank you, Dr. Seeya. Excellent, excellent example.

23:32.000 --> 23:37.000
And also, EA, you have to make the game good in order for it to, you know, be worthy of stuff.

23:37.000 --> 23:41.000
Well, no. I mean, they'll have to eventually, but it doesn't have to be good now.

23:41.000 --> 23:45.000
I know that sounds crazy, but look at Final Fantasy XIV 1.0. It wasn't good.

23:45.000 --> 23:50.000
Like, there's just no other nice way for me to say it. Final Fantasy XIV 1.0 wasn't good, and now it's great.

23:50.000 --> 23:58.000
So, I mean, they can hopefully fix some of those issues, but is EA willing to put in the time and effort? History has shown, no, they're not going to.

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
They will shut down BioWare before they do that.

24:00.000 --> 24:05.000
If they're going to change their tune, great. Let's see them do it. You know what I mean?

24:05.000 --> 24:13.000
So, anyway. Alright, so Final Fantasy XIV series, I am, like, super looking forward to it as a fan of Final Fantasy.

24:13.000 --> 24:20.000
I'll be very curious to hear more about, like, who's writing, directing the specific episodes, and who's starring, you know?

24:20.000 --> 24:26.000
Are they going to get, like, big talent in this? Or is it going to be, like, you know, unknowns and hoping that the final...

24:26.000 --> 24:31.000
Which is fine, you know, unknowns. There's, you know, maybe they're unknowns, but then they get discovered.

24:31.000 --> 24:36.000
But I'll be very curious if they lure, like, some big names to this. This will be very interesting, huh?

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
Keanu Reeves is Sid.

24:38.000 --> 24:42.000
Keanu Reeves is Sid. Who knows? Anything's possible. So, alright, anyway.

24:42.000 --> 24:47.000
Let's move on, and Nifty805 says they should put Michelle Yeoh in it.

24:47.000 --> 24:51.000
She's cool. There's a lot of people they could put in it, and I would be, like, super happy.

24:51.000 --> 24:55.000
So it's one of those things where, just, let's get some more details.

24:55.000 --> 25:01.000
But I wouldn't expect we're going to see a frame from this thing until 2021.

25:01.000 --> 25:05.000
Right? How long ago did we hear about The Witcher? It was a while ago.

25:05.000 --> 25:06.000
I think it was last year, I think.

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
And it's still not out. And we've only seen, what, like...

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
I think it's supposed to be out this year, though.

25:10.000 --> 25:11.000
Is it later this year?

25:11.000 --> 25:12.000
I think so.

25:12.000 --> 25:15.000
Okay, well then maybe we'll see something fall next year. It just depends.

25:15.000 --> 25:19.000
But I would expect we don't see a frame until 2021. But we'll see.

25:19.000 --> 25:22.000
Anyway, let's move on to, how was your gaming week?

25:22.000 --> 25:25.000
And the types of video games that you've been playing this week.

25:25.000 --> 25:29.000
And I'm laughing a little bit because I know we do a video game podcast.

25:29.000 --> 25:32.000
But we try to play as many games as we can in our spare time.

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
I don't know if we have a lot this week.

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
Loki, what are you up to this week?

25:36.000 --> 25:41.000
I'm sorry, I'm bad. I've had a stressful week. It's getting better.

25:41.000 --> 25:44.000
So I'm hoping to play more games next week.

25:44.000 --> 25:48.000
I did play a little bit of Pokemon Go this week while I was out doing things.

25:48.000 --> 25:51.000
And that was pretty much it, unfortunately.

25:51.000 --> 25:54.000
Most of the time has been spent watching Awesome Games Done Quicks.

25:54.000 --> 25:57.000
Or Summer Games Done Quick, I should say.

25:57.000 --> 26:00.000
To be fair, I bet a lot of people would say that.

26:00.000 --> 26:03.000
I didn't game myself this week because I was watching SGDQ.

26:03.000 --> 26:05.000
Because it's a big thing in the gaming community.

26:05.000 --> 26:07.000
I mean, I picked up some games.

26:07.000 --> 26:10.000
I bought Mario Maker 2 because my kids wanted to play it.

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
You said they played it and you watched it a little bit, right?

26:12.000 --> 26:13.000
They said that they were bored with it.

26:13.000 --> 26:14.000
Or they're not bored with it.

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
But they said it's not as good as the first one.

26:16.000 --> 26:20.000
But I don't know. They don't know what the hell they're talking about.

26:20.000 --> 26:21.000
They're kids!

26:21.000 --> 26:27.000
I take that back. I did play a tiny little bit of Mario and the Rabbids Kingdom Battle.

26:27.000 --> 26:30.000
Because my son wanted me to beat a level for him.

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
And so I had to do that a little bit.

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
I still haven't played through that game. I probably should.

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
And then...

26:36.000 --> 26:41.000
What else? Oh, I picked up Moshpit Simulator on PC for VR.

26:41.000 --> 26:43.000
Because my son wanted that as well.

26:43.000 --> 26:45.000
And also that looks like stupid.

26:45.000 --> 26:47.000
And I kind of want to play it as well.

26:47.000 --> 26:51.000
I've been looking through the Steam sales stuff to see if there's anything I want to pick up.

26:51.000 --> 26:54.000
There hasn't been a whole lot of things that I...

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
I put a few things in my cart and I'm like,

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
I'm not going to play that. What am I buying?

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
Or what am I even trying to buy that for?

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
Just Cause 4. I'm not playing that.

27:02.000 --> 27:05.000
I haven't played through Just Cause 3. What am I going to pick that up for?

27:05.000 --> 27:07.000
So, you know, stuff like that.

27:07.000 --> 27:10.000
So I've been just kind of holding myself back from purchasing things.

27:10.000 --> 27:14.000
Worked on my game a little bit for a couple hours the other day.

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
So he did that.

27:16.000 --> 27:19.000
Son finally graduated to Yellowbelt in his coding stuff.

27:19.000 --> 27:21.000
So now he's going to be doing JavaScript.

27:21.000 --> 27:24.000
So that's pretty cool. Outside of just, like, Scratch.

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
So he's got that for a couple more belts.

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
And yeah.

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
And I've been just doing my stuff.

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
I keep getting questions, though, from their...

27:32.000 --> 27:35.000
They call them their senseis or whatever.

27:35.000 --> 27:38.000
The kids that teach them, help them with stuff.

27:38.000 --> 27:41.000
About, like, so you can put your game on Steam.

27:41.000 --> 27:43.000
What's it called?

27:43.000 --> 27:45.000
So I'm like, dude, it's still in the prototype phase.

27:45.000 --> 27:51.000
We're not even talking about platforms and shit until I get something that resembles a game.

27:51.000 --> 27:55.000
But it's getting more and more like a game every day.

27:55.000 --> 27:57.000
Nice. Alright. Anything else?

27:57.000 --> 27:59.000
That's it.

27:59.000 --> 28:02.000
So my gaming week was pretty sad this week.

28:02.000 --> 28:05.000
I meant to pick up Mario Maker, but I got so sidetracked.

28:05.000 --> 28:11.000
So I had a big personal issue that came up this week that really took my attention.

28:11.000 --> 28:13.000
And it was, like, extremely stressful.

28:13.000 --> 28:16.000
And yeah, so I'm not going to get into details.

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
It's not worth going over on a video game podcast.

28:18.000 --> 28:24.000
But just needless to say, my attention was completely diverted with that for a couple of nights this week.

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
And some of the time I would have been playing video games.

28:26.000 --> 28:33.000
But when I wasn't, like, with that situation or with work or something,

28:33.000 --> 28:38.000
another thing that's been taking up quite a bit of my time is, and I don't know, Loki, you might laugh or whatever,

28:38.000 --> 28:42.000
but I signed up to play another one of those online reality games.

28:42.000 --> 28:45.000
I'm playing another survivor-y type of game online.

28:45.000 --> 28:49.000
So in fact, the guys running it were kind of like, you didn't say anything on your podcast last week.

28:49.000 --> 28:54.000
So I'll say something this week. And I'm even doing it for free.

28:54.000 --> 28:58.000
So I'm playing a game called Power ORG because ORG is what they call a lot of these things.

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
So ORG is online reality game.

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
So it's like a survivor-y type of clone.

29:02.000 --> 29:05.000
I played one of these about a year ago, like another big one.

29:05.000 --> 29:08.000
And so I've talked about this a little bit on the show before.

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
But basically, it's pretty elaborate.

29:10.000 --> 29:16.000
Like, there's people that work on putting it together and having like a legit…

29:16.000 --> 29:19.000
So obviously you're not stranded on a desert island.

29:19.000 --> 29:21.000
You're trying to live your freaking life, right?

29:21.000 --> 29:27.000
But when I come home from work, it's like there might be a challenge that we have to look at tonight.

29:27.000 --> 29:30.000
Or there might be a tribal council coming up.

29:30.000 --> 29:37.000
So you've got to try to chat with people or talk with people or whatever to try to make sure that it's not going to be you that gets voted out and that whole thing.

29:37.000 --> 29:40.000
But you guys know that I've been listening to show for a long time.

29:40.000 --> 29:43.000
I've always kind of had a soft spot for those type of games.

29:43.000 --> 29:46.000
Well, here's the thing. I've loved game shows all the time since I was a kid, right?

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
I grew up on the match game, right? And that type of stuff.

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
And pressure lock and all that shit, right?

29:50.000 --> 29:55.000
So when it kind of got fused with reality TV, when Survivor first started, what?

29:55.000 --> 29:57.000
It's going to be like 20 years ago, right?

29:57.000 --> 29:58.000
Yeah.

29:59.000 --> 30:01.000
I kind of was really into that now.

30:01.000 --> 30:04.000
It's interesting because I don't watch the TV shows as much now.

30:04.000 --> 30:09.000
But it doesn't mean I don't think the game is kind of fun. It's kind of neat.

30:09.000 --> 30:13.000
But I always forget what a time sink it can be until I kind of get into it.

30:13.000 --> 30:19.000
And part of the reason I agreed to do it is because I'd been asked to do some other games.

30:19.000 --> 30:23.000
I had to keep saying no because I knew I'd be gone for a week.

30:23.000 --> 30:26.000
I'm going to Chicago for a week and it's in the middle of the game. I can't do it.

30:26.000 --> 30:29.000
I'm going to a convention. I'm going to Dragon Con. I'm going to whatever.

30:29.000 --> 30:35.000
And if you agree to do this, you want to realistically know that you're going to have six weeks

30:35.000 --> 30:38.000
where you can kind of actually be there to play the game.

30:38.000 --> 30:43.000
But a nice little time period here kind of worked out where it's the end of June.

30:43.000 --> 30:45.000
And this is, I think, supposed to go through mid-August.

30:45.000 --> 30:49.000
So it's right up against then Dragon Con so it won't get in the way.

30:49.000 --> 30:51.000
So I was like, okay, the timing works out.

30:51.000 --> 30:54.000
I know some of the people that are putting it together.

30:54.000 --> 30:57.000
I'd met through the community so I'm like, what the hell? I'll do it.

30:57.000 --> 31:01.000
And then I'm like, oh, shit, now I haven't played any video games this week because of it.

31:01.000 --> 31:09.000
Kudos to the ORG community in general that's very passionate and stuff about it.

31:09.000 --> 31:11.000
It's pretty impressive.

31:11.000 --> 31:14.000
They actually did a little, oh, I should have pulled it and showed it on the show.

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
You guys would have cracked up.

31:16.000 --> 31:20.000
They actually did a little fakey-fake introduction that looks like the show.

31:20.000 --> 31:24.000
So we had to go out and shoot ourselves doing something in nature.

31:24.000 --> 31:30.000
And then a little turn and face the camera type of shot where it's like, face the camera, that type of thing.

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
Like they kind of do on the show.

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
Although mine's a little more serious than that.

31:34.000 --> 31:39.000
But then a guy actually put it all together and put a little theme music and it's super cute.

31:39.000 --> 31:43.000
So it's amazing what fans can do, don't you think?

31:43.000 --> 31:44.000
Yeah.

31:44.000 --> 31:45.000
That's right.

31:46.000 --> 31:53.000
And now it's going to take something like that being put on Twitch on a regular basis.

31:53.000 --> 31:56.000
Oh, I'm sure it's been on Twitch somewhere.

31:56.000 --> 32:02.000
People stream themselves playing like Werewolf and Mafia and that kind of stuff.

32:02.000 --> 32:07.000
These things are just like the next step past that.

32:07.000 --> 32:11.000
So like an underground survivor type show.

32:12.000 --> 32:19.000
Several people I've met doing these things have done a thing called Sequester, which is like a YouTube show.

32:19.000 --> 32:22.000
And I think that's another big thing.

32:22.000 --> 32:29.000
Like fan shows, I know there's a big one, Survivor Maryland, Survivor Boston.

32:29.000 --> 32:35.000
And so they do like a lot of college campuses have like a Survivor Club or something like that.

32:35.000 --> 32:39.000
And they do like a fakey-fake version of the show and they put it on YouTube.

32:39.000 --> 32:45.000
And I guess for whatever reason, the production company behind Survivor is cool with it because I've never seen them try to shut that type of stuff down.

32:45.000 --> 32:47.000
But I mean, it's kind of free advertising for the brand.

32:47.000 --> 32:49.000
That show's been on for 20 years.

32:49.000 --> 32:55.000
I don't think they were like, well, people want to watch the Survivor Philadelphia version more than like whatever.

32:55.000 --> 32:58.000
OK, so I'm getting questions in chat about this.

32:58.000 --> 33:04.000
So S2100 Matt says, is Rob the character that isn't there to make friends and will do what he wants?

33:04.000 --> 33:08.000
Well, now I can't give away my strategy on air because I don't know who's watching.

33:08.000 --> 33:14.000
But no, I I wouldn't play the games if I didn't genuinely enjoy meeting the people.

33:14.000 --> 33:20.000
And I like the last game I played, I met somebody that lived here in the same town that I do.

33:20.000 --> 33:24.000
And we actually like we hang out once a month, like we're legit like friends.

33:24.000 --> 33:28.000
So he lasted a lot longer in the game than I did. But like we're legit friends. We hang out.

33:28.000 --> 33:34.000
I actually want to do an episode of OLR one night where we bring some of those guys, because there's a few of them that live here, bring some of them over.

33:34.000 --> 33:38.000
And we have like an ORG night on the show, kind of like we did the Ingers night a few months ago.

33:38.000 --> 33:41.000
That's ORG, not ORG.

33:41.000 --> 33:49.000
ORG. I'm not violating the online reality game. ORG. I'm not violating the Twitch terms of service by having an ORG.

33:49.000 --> 33:55.000
OK, it's different. All right. Anyway, what was the other question I saw in chat here?

33:55.000 --> 34:02.000
Oh, Nifty 105 says, Rob Roberts is not the silky. He's probably more like the Ben De La Creme.

34:02.000 --> 34:07.000
Those are Drag Race references. Let's see. I don't know what what. Oh, you know.

34:07.000 --> 34:12.000
Now, here's the here's the here's the real tea. You ready? I'm the Charlie Hides.

34:12.000 --> 34:21.000
Because I'm like the only one that's like 40, like a lot of them to play are like mid 20s, late 20s, maybe a few early 30s.

34:21.000 --> 34:27.000
Like one of the people I met here in town is like maybe 33, I think. So, yeah, no, I'm definitely like that.

34:27.000 --> 34:31.000
And yeah, I'm very much the how do you do fellow kids like that's yeah.

34:31.000 --> 34:37.000
But that's because I started this whole thing years ago on LiveJournal when I was 28.

34:37.000 --> 34:39.000
They were doing these things back on LiveJournal then, too.

34:39.000 --> 34:44.000
And then it was one of my friends from back in those days that was like, did you know these are still going on?

34:44.000 --> 34:48.000
But they all play on Skype now and not AOL. It's a messenger. I'm like, what? Tell me more.

34:48.000 --> 34:52.000
And then, yeah, I played one. I was like, OK, this is fun. It's really stressful, but it's fun.

34:52.000 --> 35:00.000
So, cool. There you go. All right. I spent way too much time on that topic, except for maybe the couple of people from that community that will be listening to this who will probably get a kick out of that.

35:00.000 --> 35:10.000
So there you go. You can you can look it up on Facebook. There's your free promo for Power Orgy, not Power Orgy, or you're going to get something completely different.

35:10.000 --> 35:15.000
Just a warning. All right. So that's it for our gaming leaks.

35:15.000 --> 35:18.000
Yeah, it's still it's still a game. What I'm doing, it's just not a video game.

35:18.000 --> 35:24.000
Yeah, it's a different type of game. So it's it's fucking LARPing is what it is.

35:24.000 --> 35:30.000
It's it's fucking LARPing. It is. It's more respectable LARPing, I guess.

35:30.000 --> 35:35.000
Oh, why? Thank you. It's LARPing without the effort.

35:35.000 --> 35:42.000
It's LARPing, except you are kind of being yourself unless you want to be a character, I guess. I don't know. Anyway.

35:42.000 --> 35:47.000
S.J. 100 Matt says it's LARPing without yelling out spells. I had some of the challenges.

35:47.000 --> 35:50.000
I don't know. I don't know. All right. Let's move on. New topic. All right.

35:50.000 --> 35:55.000
Let's get into some gaming news and some things that have been going on around the video game world this week.

35:55.000 --> 36:00.000
Loki, start us off. They got LARPing and ingress, isn't a thing? I don't know.

36:00.000 --> 36:06.000
I don't know. So anyways, there's yeah, there's a steam sale going on in case you weren't aware.

36:06.000 --> 36:11.000
And Valve has been doing this thing where they have it's kind of like a racing theme.

36:11.000 --> 36:20.000
So they've got five teams that you can pick to join and basing based on certain challenges,

36:20.000 --> 36:28.000
you purchasing games and I think doing other things, it helps boost your team ahead and and everybody's team corgi.

36:28.000 --> 36:33.000
So it doesn't matter anyways. You just pick team corgi and then you might win something.

36:33.000 --> 36:40.000
Basically, I think every day or every so often they will see who's going to win.

36:40.000 --> 36:45.000
And based on that, some people might win their top wish list game.

36:45.000 --> 36:56.000
But there was some confusion what you had to do to actually be able to win some stuff.

36:56.000 --> 37:07.000
So what people have done is they've thought that they had to remove games from their wish list in order to boost the chance that they're going to win the one that they want.

37:07.000 --> 37:15.000
And that's unfortunately caused some issues where that they have removed like some people that had indie games out there.

37:15.000 --> 37:22.000
They're like, we saw a huge drop in all the people that had our game on their wish list because we were a five dollar indie game.

37:22.000 --> 37:28.000
Yeah. So, you know, unfortunately, that was kind of one of the things.

37:28.000 --> 37:33.000
Also, there has been I guess in this one, though, you can't actually get like trading cards.

37:33.000 --> 37:41.000
It's just earning different things from this whole event. I stopped caring about that stuff a long time ago.

37:41.000 --> 37:46.000
I just been looking at some of the stuff that's on sale, which is a few things I want.

37:46.000 --> 37:49.000
Definitely not as like deep cuts in.

37:49.000 --> 38:01.000
And also now that the sales are kind of the same, I think every single day, as far as I'm aware, it's less of that coming back to like, oh, what's on sale today or what's on sale right now?

38:01.000 --> 38:04.000
You know, these flash sales and stuff like that. Oh, a better wait.

38:04.000 --> 38:07.000
And, you know, that was more interesting and more traffic to the site, I think.

38:07.000 --> 38:10.000
But now it's just kind of. I don't know.

38:10.000 --> 38:14.000
So like they were saying, here's some of the quotes we had from different developers.

38:14.000 --> 38:21.000
So they were saying that Yitz, who is, I guess, a developer of a game called Neffing and the Dark or to the Dark Tower,

38:21.000 --> 38:30.000
basically saying that most indies who we're talking to at least are losing more money from the Steam's or Steam's cut than from taking in from visibility.

38:30.000 --> 38:35.000
I and many other devs are currently losing money from being hosted on Steam.

38:35.000 --> 38:45.000
And of course, Valve is apologizing, saying we designed something pretty complicated, a whole bunch of numbers and rules and recognize we should have been more clear.

38:45.000 --> 38:52.000
We want to apologize for the confusion that this has caused and apologize for the broken mechanics that have led to unbalanced event.

38:52.000 --> 38:59.000
So the TLDR of that is be Team Corgi because you're going to win every time.

39:00.000 --> 39:04.000
Yeah, I as somebody told me about that and said, just go pick Corgi.

39:04.000 --> 39:09.000
So I logged in and did that. But then it was like, oh, you got to play these games to get the achievement and all this stuff.

39:09.000 --> 39:14.000
And I'm like, I'd love to do this. But, you know, the other thing I signed up for going on.

39:14.000 --> 39:19.000
And even when I'm not doing that, I didn't even talk about during my gaming week. So I guess I'll just sneak it in here.

39:19.000 --> 39:23.000
I did touch that Final Fantasy 14 expansion, at least for a few hours.

39:23.000 --> 39:28.000
And so I haven't gotten enough into the story, but I will say it's fucking gorgeous.

39:28.000 --> 39:36.000
Like the whole concept of it to start is that you go into this. I don't want to call it the upside down because that's like you.

39:36.000 --> 39:37.000
Dynamics.

39:37.000 --> 39:41.000
It would make you think, well, it's like you go to like an alternate reality of the world.

39:41.000 --> 39:47.000
They call it the first. But you go to like an alternate reality world where like you end up there in the first guy you meet.

39:47.000 --> 39:50.000
It's like super bright out. And he goes, what are you doing here this time of night?

39:50.000 --> 39:54.000
Even though it's like super bright out. And so you kind of get the sense that like things are off.

39:54.000 --> 40:01.000
And in this world, light has ruined things. So that's kind of like the whole setup.

40:01.000 --> 40:07.000
So the world looks very different and it's gorgeous. So, yeah, I played that for a few hours.

40:07.000 --> 40:14.000
I ran a dungeon that was nothing but dancers and gun breakers and me, the astrologian, because I was trying to get a feel for my job.

40:14.000 --> 40:18.000
And they made healing a lot harder. Boy, because they've shuffled all the skills and all this stuff.

40:18.000 --> 40:22.000
So it was fun. But it's just like, oh, I got to reorient and like remember things.

40:22.000 --> 40:27.000
I'm sure there's going to be some balancing patches. I'm sure of it. But I enjoyed what I played a FOM SE 14 so far.

40:27.000 --> 40:28.000
Cool.

40:28.000 --> 40:34.000
So, yeah, there's that anyway. So that's part of the reason why I didn't do the achievements in the steam sale and all that other stuff.

40:34.000 --> 40:40.000
But I will point out the number one thing on my steam wish list is like a one hundred dollar game development program.

40:40.000 --> 40:47.000
Would I actually win that if I won something on steam or are they going to say like a maximum is 60 bucks and something else?

40:47.000 --> 40:51.000
I'm not going to win anything because there's so many millions of people on steam.

40:51.000 --> 40:57.000
It just doesn't. Who cares? Oh, no, I won't get a free game that will go into my library.

40:57.000 --> 41:01.000
That will never play. Oh, geez. Oh, darn.

41:01.000 --> 41:05.000
Why we are in our chat says, yeah, I won't have much time to play during the steam sale either.

41:05.000 --> 41:15.000
I don't even have enough time to put together a 10 anniversary video last week because why we are developed games and has a few over the past 10 years from video clips and voiceovers that I already had recorded.

41:15.000 --> 41:22.000
Well, yeah. You know, life happens, right? Day jobs get in the way. That's what happens. Yeah. So anyhow.

41:22.000 --> 41:30.000
Yeah. So if you haven't already gone in on the steam sale, you might want to just check your wish list because maybe there's something on there you want to get when it's on sale.

41:30.000 --> 41:34.000
And, you know, go go check out the race thing, even though it's a really weird mechanic.

41:34.000 --> 41:38.000
Like if you wanted me to explain how that race works, I really can't. Yeah.

41:38.000 --> 41:45.000
Can anyone in chat like summarize how does the race thing even work? Is it just like the more achievements your team unlocks, the further you go in the race?

41:45.000 --> 41:51.000
I think it's also like you buy stuff and you get points, which is weird because I bought stuff, but I couldn't apply points to anything.

41:51.000 --> 41:58.000
So I guess my purchase didn't count. Not that I care, but I know.

41:58.000 --> 42:05.000
Yeah, I did notice like all the things that were like spending points on like a lot of it was like themes and mode icons and that type of stuff that you'd usually get from the trading cards.

42:05.000 --> 42:12.000
So, yeah. And I was like, OK, it's not the end of the world. I didn't even know what like I was just looking at some different things that are in there.

42:12.000 --> 42:18.000
And I don't know. I'll probably I'm looking for like some cheap VR games, you know, so that that was kind of one thing.

42:18.000 --> 42:23.000
And then there's just some stuff that I've had on my wish list for a while that I was looking at.

42:23.000 --> 42:27.000
I thought about just cause for but like I seriously I have just caused three on PlayStation four.

42:27.000 --> 42:31.000
I've not played that game. And four I hear is not that great anyways.

42:31.000 --> 42:37.000
Oh, how much is six down to. That's a that's a great game there.

42:37.000 --> 42:42.000
Oh, twenty nine ninety nine. That's twenty five percent. That's the DLC only gathering storm.

42:42.000 --> 42:49.000
Oh, yeah. Yeah. You pick that up actually. So maybe I'll do it. I know it's guys half off blood scenes. Ten percent.

42:49.000 --> 42:52.000
I know why we are is explaining a little better what the sales all about.

42:52.000 --> 42:59.000
Chat say you can buy stuff to increase the max number of points you can earn to actually earn the points.

42:59.000 --> 43:03.000
You complete the quest and or unlock achievements in the steam games.

43:03.000 --> 43:07.000
So I mean, what it is, you actually have to play games, Loki. No.

43:07.000 --> 43:13.000
And then the team with the most points wins, a.k.a. corgi wins because everybody loves corgis.

43:13.000 --> 43:17.000
I'm not even a dog person and I think corgis are so fucking cute.

43:17.000 --> 43:21.000
Yeah. So I mean, it's the way it is. Let's see.

43:21.000 --> 43:28.000
S.S.U. 100 Matt with an interesting perspective as well in our chat at Twitch TV slash Vogue Network says Prime Day is in a few weeks.

43:28.000 --> 43:32.000
So I might just wait for that. That's true. There are other sales.

43:32.000 --> 43:42.000
I am waiting for Prime Day because I have a thing I got from my job, which is it's like a gift card servicing.

43:42.000 --> 43:47.000
So you can redeem it for any type of gift card or most different gift cards.

43:47.000 --> 43:53.000
I usually put it towards Amazon. So it's like 100 bucks towards Amazon on Prime Day, which I don't know the hell I'd buy, though.

43:53.000 --> 43:58.000
I bought a 4K TV last year. I bought a VR headset just recently.

43:58.000 --> 44:01.000
I saw what the hell am I going to need? I still don't have a 4K TV.

44:01.000 --> 44:09.000
Like I'm tempted, but at the same time, like we need to spend money on more important things and responsibility.

44:09.000 --> 44:15.000
Like a few hundred bucks. I guess that's true. I'm tempted, but the longer you wait, the cheaper they get.

44:15.000 --> 44:19.000
That's true. So maybe I'll maybe I'll wait for like the holiday sales. Maybe it'll make a little more sense.

44:19.000 --> 44:23.000
Because if you don't need it right away, there's I have 4K on my computer.

44:23.000 --> 44:29.000
So, you know, again, I do more kind of there. How about you buy a new graphics card for your computer then?

44:29.000 --> 44:33.000
That's honestly I wouldn't mind if I can find a good deal on something.

44:33.000 --> 44:40.000
Well, they have the new super the GTX super cards that are coming or RTX super cards,

44:40.000 --> 44:47.000
which are they're like they're a new set of graphics cards, but they're also going to be dropping the price of their older ones as well.

44:47.000 --> 44:51.000
So you might look into that. It's going to happen in a couple weeks.

44:53.000 --> 44:57.000
Yeah. Is Bitcoin mining still a problem with availability of those?

44:57.000 --> 45:03.000
I think it's kind of dipped down because the price of Bitcoin has gone down, although it is going back up.

45:03.000 --> 45:08.000
So it's not as bad as it used to be. Gotcha. All right.

45:08.000 --> 45:13.000
As Stu 100 Matt says, Shane will use his hero's power to talk Rob into something.

45:13.000 --> 45:19.000
He's already tried along the lines of, are you really playing another online game?

45:19.000 --> 45:24.000
Just quit that game and come play Final Fantasy 14. And I'm like, no, I have too much.

45:24.000 --> 45:28.000
If I say I'm going to do something, I'm going to do it. So, you know, but we'll see.

45:28.000 --> 45:34.000
Anyway, we'll see how long it lasts for me anyway.

45:34.000 --> 45:41.000
Moving on. Let's talk about the Final Fantasy 7 remake.

45:41.000 --> 45:45.000
Final Fantasy 7, of course, is getting remade. We all know that.

45:45.000 --> 45:50.000
And the remake is coming out March 20th, 2020.

45:51.000 --> 45:56.000
I forgot the exact day, but it's in March. Do you remember the day?

45:56.000 --> 45:59.000
I don't remember. I forgot the day. Somebody in chat would yell it out.

45:59.000 --> 46:03.000
But anyway, it's starting to sound more and more like this first part of the Final Fantasy 7 remake.

46:03.000 --> 46:09.000
I mean, it's like this is almost becoming its own Final Fantasy game, which I think we kind of saw coming a little bit.

46:09.000 --> 46:13.000
The specifics this week that's coming out is about Materia.

46:13.000 --> 46:18.000
So Materia is getting an overhaul, which kind of makes sense when you consider the battle system is different in the game.

46:19.000 --> 46:24.000
Materia can't really work the exact same way because it's a little more action-based.

46:24.000 --> 46:29.000
And so maybe the Materia being used on the spells and stuff is not really going to be the same thing.

46:29.000 --> 46:31.000
So Materia is going to get a little bit of an overhaul.

46:31.000 --> 46:33.000
We're going to use the draw system for me instead.

46:33.000 --> 46:38.000
No, no. You still are going to slot Materia in weapons and all that stuff.

46:38.000 --> 46:42.000
But Materia shows up on your party members when you equip it.

46:42.000 --> 46:48.000
But yeah, it's going to change a little bit, so don't be used to the exact same way it worked before.

46:48.000 --> 46:52.000
But you're going to have to use the special in-game currency to purchase your Materia.

46:52.000 --> 46:56.000
Don't put that shit in the universe. Do not put that shit in the universe.

46:56.000 --> 46:59.000
It'll be coming in a loot box that you can get your Materia in.

46:59.000 --> 47:04.000
Well, what I'm also kind of curious about is that if this is only like Episode 1 or whatever,

47:04.000 --> 47:10.000
and it only goes through the Midgar part, are we still going to get, even though it's like a 60-hour game still,

47:10.000 --> 47:19.000
are we going to get the stages of fire, fura, fire aga, like the full evolution of magic

47:19.000 --> 47:21.000
that you would see in a normal Final Fantasy game?

47:21.000 --> 47:25.000
Or because it's only the first part of the game, we're only ever going to have fire?

47:25.000 --> 47:29.000
Maybe fura, but that's it. It's never going to go for the full stages.

47:29.000 --> 47:32.000
Are we going to be still kind of limited? Like you're not going to see Ultima in the game?

47:32.000 --> 47:36.000
Or Summons? I don't think Summons came up until after Midgar. I can't remember. It's been a while.

47:37.000 --> 47:40.000
And Aerith is still going to be alive.

47:40.000 --> 47:45.000
In this game, yes. Because in Final Fantasy VII, the original, she does not pass until later on.

47:45.000 --> 47:47.000
She passes to the end of this one.

47:47.000 --> 47:51.000
There's going to be people that are actually surprised by that course of events.

47:51.000 --> 47:57.000
Well, and as you said on a previous episode of the show, maybe Square will change it. That would be the real gag.

47:57.000 --> 48:00.000
Cloud dies! Oh my god!

48:00.000 --> 48:04.000
They're clearly taking liberties with the story.

48:04.000 --> 48:09.000
And this is more and more feeling like, I don't want to say Final Fantasy XVI,

48:09.000 --> 48:15.000
but this is definitely like every resource that would have been Final Fantasy XVI.

48:15.000 --> 48:19.000
This is Final Fantasy XVI in how it plays and how it looks.

48:19.000 --> 48:25.000
And now some of the mechanics almost sounds like it's just that the story is a retread.

48:25.000 --> 48:29.000
A little bit. It's so interesting. It's Star Wars Episode VII.

48:29.000 --> 48:33.000
They've resurrected the cow. We're getting ghost milk out of the cow now.

48:33.000 --> 48:38.000
And they're just going to keep milking that cow until forever.

48:40.000 --> 48:45.000
Questbuster says, wait, Aerith will live in this iteration? Guess I won't have to worry about finding a new healer then.

48:45.000 --> 48:49.000
Well, it's only through Midgar, so if you remember the story,

48:49.000 --> 48:55.000
Aerith doesn't die until later on in the story, after they're out in the world map.

48:55.000 --> 48:58.000
It's a little bit later on. She dies at the end of disc one.

48:58.000 --> 49:03.000
Maybe. So in this, she's not going to, unless, again, who knows if they're going to change.

49:03.000 --> 49:07.000
Maybe they'll go the Tomb Raider route and she can die in lots of horrible ways.

49:09.000 --> 49:13.000
Oh, Dark Sakura would love that. Aerith's no good, terrible, very bad day.

49:13.000 --> 49:15.000
Yes. Yes.

49:17.000 --> 49:19.000
So, let's see.

49:19.000 --> 49:25.000
Questbuster also points out Materia will have, in quotes, surprise mechanics.

49:25.000 --> 49:29.000
Not the EA type of surprise mechanics, I think we're hoping.

49:29.000 --> 49:36.000
So anyway, I'm still, I mean, the folks I know that did go to E3 said, like, it's fun.

49:36.000 --> 49:42.000
Like Final Fantasy 7 is fun. So it's going to be interesting, especially for the people that don't care for Final Fantasy 7,

49:42.000 --> 49:46.000
because maybe people have hyped it up in history too much.

49:46.000 --> 49:52.000
It's going to be interesting to see maybe what that group feels about this remake, because I imagine, you know,

49:52.000 --> 49:57.000
most people are going to try this, whether they love the story or they hate the story, just because it's so different.

49:57.000 --> 50:01.000
You know, and maybe, and because they've apparently taken some liberties with the story,

50:01.000 --> 50:03.000
and maybe they're going to, you know, take some different branching paths.

50:03.000 --> 50:06.000
And it's been so long anyways, I really don't remember much of the story.

50:06.000 --> 50:09.000
I know, I don't either. I'm sure you can go read about it on Wikipedia, read the cliff notes and all that,

50:09.000 --> 50:12.000
or go watch Advent Children to remember a good chunk of it.

50:12.000 --> 50:16.000
But you're right. It's been so long that I'll probably go play this remake and go like,

50:16.000 --> 50:20.000
okay, I remember a lot of that, even though, like, it's all new.

50:21.000 --> 50:27.000
So, Kaijuto in chat says, I don't get the Aerith hate. I love that character.

50:27.000 --> 50:34.000
You know, honestly, Kaijuto, like when I first played for, wow, my computer is playing an ad over here.

50:34.000 --> 50:38.000
That's crazy. Anyway, thankfully this doesn't, this audio doesn't go on the feed anymore.

50:38.000 --> 50:40.000
So it's just, it just scares me.

50:40.000 --> 50:48.000
But yeah, when I first played Final Fantasy 7, I liked Aerith and I, because she was like my White Mage, my healer, right?

50:48.000 --> 50:53.000
So I used her in the party. And so like when she got offed, I was like, it really was a huge shock.

50:53.000 --> 50:56.000
Wow. She got her level four limit break. That's so convenient.

50:56.000 --> 50:58.000
Why hasn't anybody else gotten their level four? Oh.

50:58.000 --> 51:04.000
Yeah. And I was like, oh, I never got her level four limit break, but I was like, well, this is fucking irritating.

51:04.000 --> 51:11.000
I've been leveling her for what? Because I kept thinking she'd come back and I'm like, oh, I guess, no, she, she dead.

51:11.000 --> 51:16.000
So that was like frustrating for me. So I don't know if it's Aerith so much that I hate.

51:16.000 --> 51:24.000
I, I still resent to this day the time I invested in her for nothing. I think that's what it is.

51:24.000 --> 51:32.000
YYR in chat says, I'm one of those people. I liked Final Fantasy 7's characters, but I found the story to be meh and the gameplay to be disappointing.

51:32.000 --> 51:36.000
So I'd love to see some improvements though. I won't have time to play it anyway. We'll see.

51:36.000 --> 51:39.000
Anyway, let's move on some more stories. Loki.

51:39.000 --> 51:46.000
All right. So let's talk a little bit more about TV again and another show that's going to be coming out.

51:46.000 --> 51:52.000
So this is more along the lines of that one that they were talking about during the Ubisoft press conference where it's about game developers,

51:52.000 --> 51:56.000
except these are actually about real game developers and not just like some imaginary company.

51:56.000 --> 52:08.000
So this is an adaptation of a book called Masters of Doom that talks a little bit about how John Romero and John Carmack came together to create, of course, Doom.

52:08.000 --> 52:15.000
And so it's a series, I guess, that's being produced by James and Dave Franco.

52:15.000 --> 52:33.000
And yeah, it looks like it's just going to be an adaptation about how they formed id Software and how they kind of made that genre popularize the first person shooter genre.

52:34.000 --> 52:41.000
I'm pretty excited about it. Apparently, it's expected to air on USA in twenty nineteen.

52:41.000 --> 52:48.000
So. Yeah, I'm down. That sounds like it's really interesting.

52:48.000 --> 52:56.000
Yeah, a little more of the it's like Silicon Valley, Silicon Valley, as I say, it sounds a little more like it's like the behind the scenes.

52:56.000 --> 53:00.000
So it's not really about the game. It's like they're making Doom a new TV show, which, you know, the movie was not great.

53:00.000 --> 53:14.000
So good thing. But kind of like that development, which is it's it's neat because now we're really seeing like video games and the impact on culture, despite however you feel about the character, the particular people that are going to be portrayed or or this particular game.

53:14.000 --> 53:24.000
It's really neat that like video game development is like a cultural thing that is worth representing in television and other art forms, if that makes sense.

53:24.000 --> 53:33.000
Yeah, right. It looks cool. Yeah. So, yeah, I'll check it out. I'll watch the first episode, see what I think. Right. Yeah, I've watched that.

53:33.000 --> 53:43.000
And I'm also very excited about that other show that unfortunately is going to be an Apple exclusive show that the one that's with the guys from It's Always Sunny doing that.

53:43.000 --> 53:49.000
Oh, yeah. What is what what game? What is that one about? It's it's it's like a fake MMO type thing.

53:49.000 --> 53:58.000
I don't remember what the show is actually called, but it's. I do want to check it out because of the folks in it, but.

53:58.000 --> 54:05.000
Yeah. Oh, yeah. Well, because. Well, and the always sunny in Philadelphia thing like that has to be ending soon. That's been on for what, like 12 years.

54:05.000 --> 54:11.000
I'm sure they want to go their own separate ways soon. You know, it's been on for a long time, although.

54:11.000 --> 54:20.000
Yeah, some of them have gone off to do other shows, but I know like one of them, like APA Bio, is being canceled. So it's like, OK, what are you going to be doing now?

54:20.000 --> 54:28.000
Siya Tiberian Chat says, don't forget USA knows drama, characters welcome. Yeah, it is interesting. I mean, USA is, you know, kind of pumped up its drama stuff.

54:28.000 --> 54:36.000
So it's an interesting place for it to land. I think there's a lot of us that are kind of like, OK, so it'll air on USA. But but which digital service is going to get it?

54:37.000 --> 54:44.000
Yeah, I know. Right. I think it's where a lot of us are. You think we're going to end up kind of back where we were like 10 years ago, where everything gets pirated?

54:44.000 --> 54:52.000
Like you say, like, it's unfortunate this thing is going to Apple or it's unfortunate this thing is going to this service where it's like, I'm not going to pay for 17 different services.

54:52.000 --> 55:00.000
So it's like you think piracy, we're going to kind of end up right back there because these services will not work a little more collaboratively.

55:00.000 --> 55:06.000
Yes. Yeah, I think that's exactly where we end up, which is fine with me.

55:06.000 --> 55:14.000
Questbuster in chat says, I hope the series does the story justice. That's true. They might embellish some things. They might, you know, make up lies.

55:14.000 --> 55:18.000
But that's that's what happens when stories get adapted for TV, I guess.

55:18.000 --> 55:22.000
Metal Mayhem says, I've heard of that book thanks to Game Informer, but I never got it.

55:22.000 --> 55:28.000
I did get the audiobook version of The Ultimate Guide to Video Games from Pong to Pokemon a while back through Humble Bundle.

55:28.000 --> 55:32.000
So I guess audiobook is always a good way to listen to books, too, if you want to do that.

55:32.000 --> 55:36.000
Yeah, I got that. I bought that one series. I don't remember which books were in that.

55:36.000 --> 55:42.000
But for the record, this is like the one podcast that isn't sponsored by any sort of audiobook service. So I'm not pitching that.

55:42.000 --> 55:51.000
No, there was one I got that was it wasn't that it was remember I showed you there was one about ZZT in there about the making of like ZZT.

55:51.000 --> 55:57.000
But I don't remember what that one was. And they were a small like I wouldn't even necessarily call it a book.

55:57.000 --> 56:03.000
I mean, it was a book, but it was really short. And I don't remember which Humble Bundle it was.

56:03.000 --> 56:05.000
But I bought that one with the ZZT thing because.

56:05.000 --> 56:07.000
Boss Fight Books says PixelBox.

56:07.000 --> 56:09.000
There you go. Thank you. Yes.

56:09.000 --> 56:12.000
Chatter is always there to save the day when we can't remember things.

56:12.000 --> 56:20.000
When I'm too lazy to search it in Google or go into Humble Bundle and actually see what what it's called speaking, which I have to see what they have on there right now.

56:20.000 --> 56:28.000
I'm compelled to buy things that I don't need. That's where I should spend my hundred dollars on this crap.

56:28.000 --> 56:30.000
Ooh, programming.

56:30.000 --> 56:31.000
Hi.

56:31.000 --> 56:36.000
Anyways, moving on. Let's talk about Bloodstained and the Switch version.

56:36.000 --> 56:43.000
So the Switch version of Bloodstained finally came out this week because it was delayed a week from the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions.

56:43.000 --> 56:46.000
That's the version that I ended up getting through my Kickstarter.

56:46.000 --> 56:50.000
But due to the things I talked about earlier, I just haven't gotten around to playing it yet.

56:50.000 --> 56:58.000
But apparently the port is not quite performing on the same level as the other versions, which, you know, due to technical.

56:58.000 --> 57:01.000
You know, what's inside a switch is not what's inside a PlayStation 4.

57:01.000 --> 57:03.000
So you write a little bit of it at the same time.

57:03.000 --> 57:10.000
If you're going to put the game on the switch, it needs to be able to perform at a respectable, comparable level just as far as the game goes.

57:10.000 --> 57:12.000
And apparently it's having some problems.

57:12.000 --> 57:17.000
I have not played it myself, so I don't feel comfortable saying it's doing X or Y or Z for me.

57:17.000 --> 57:21.000
How would they even put that on the Wii U when that was originally the plan, was to put it on the Wii U?

57:21.000 --> 57:26.000
I mean, I can't imagine that that would have been successful at all if they're having trouble on the Switch.

57:26.000 --> 57:31.000
Yeah, I don't know. I think they changed. I'm sorry, I'm having a coughing fit, guys.

57:31.000 --> 57:37.000
But anyways. Yeah, that's unfortunate. I do want to play it, though.

57:37.000 --> 57:40.000
Yeah. Sorry, guys. Coughing fit's terrible when you're trying to do a show.

57:40.000 --> 57:45.000
Anyway, I'm curious what you guys in chat, if any of you have played it on the Switch.

57:45.000 --> 57:50.000
And do you guys think a lot of this talk is, like, you know, because sometimes, you know how it goes.

57:50.000 --> 57:55.000
Like, gamers will take a few small minor things and make a big fucking deal out of it, you know.

57:55.000 --> 57:59.000
I think we saw that happen with Mass Effect Andromeda in some cases, you know, and so on.

57:59.000 --> 58:04.000
So I'm curious if you guys think it really is a problem for those of you that have played Bloodstained on Switch.

58:04.000 --> 58:10.000
But apparently low resolution and handheld is getting called out. Some visual pieces are not there.

58:10.000 --> 58:14.000
I would expect that the graphic fidelity is probably a little bit downgraded.

58:14.000 --> 58:18.000
Like, if there's some missing things that aren't in the other ones, I might expect a little bit of that.

58:18.000 --> 58:24.000
I mean, but then again, I feel like Bloodstained is not, like, it's still like a 2.5D.

58:24.000 --> 58:28.000
Like, you know, it's 3D, but in a 2D game. So I feel like it's not.

58:28.000 --> 58:29.000
It should be very minimal.

58:29.000 --> 58:30.000
Yeah, right.

58:30.000 --> 58:38.000
So anyway, well, it is important to point out the developers behind Bloodstained have addressed all these issues on their Kickstarter page and saying they are going to update it.

58:38.000 --> 58:42.000
Saying, quote, we have been listening to feedback regarding the Switch's performance.

58:42.000 --> 58:47.000
Our goal is for everyone, regardless of platform, to be able to enjoy the game and have it run smoothly.

58:47.000 --> 58:50.000
We will want to live up to your and our expectations.

58:50.000 --> 58:54.000
Throughout the QA process, we have been addressing performance issues in the game.

58:54.000 --> 58:59.000
Update 101 was published to Switch prior to launch to add content and improve performance.

58:59.000 --> 59:04.000
Because they seem to remember, didn't the Switch version have problems at a convention that they were showing you at?

59:04.000 --> 59:06.000
And they were kind of like, it's further along.

59:06.000 --> 59:08.000
I seem to remember that was the thing at, like, PAX or something.

59:08.000 --> 59:10.000
I sort of remember that.

59:10.000 --> 59:13.000
Anyway, they said it did not accomplish as much as we'd hoped, and we need to do more.

59:13.000 --> 59:20.000
To address the concerns brought up by the community, we are immediately shifting resources to improve performance and stability for the Switch.

59:20.000 --> 59:23.000
So don't expect any type of DLC or anything else right away, because they've got to fix this.

59:24.000 --> 59:29.000
You can expect a number of small updates that will improve different areas of the game, rather than waiting longer for one big update.

59:29.000 --> 59:31.000
We will have more details as we dive into the work.

59:31.000 --> 59:34.000
We thank you for your patience, et cetera, et cetera.

59:34.000 --> 59:38.000
So now I'm starting to wonder if, should I bother starting?

59:38.000 --> 59:41.000
Or should I wait a month for them to get some patches out?

59:41.000 --> 59:43.000
I don't know.

59:43.000 --> 59:46.000
YYR in chat says, are there any versions that don't have issues?

59:46.000 --> 59:49.000
Questbuster says, the Bloodstained Switch issues make me sad.

59:49.000 --> 59:53.000
I have the PlayStation 4 version, which has its own issues, but the Switch issues sound worse.

59:53.000 --> 59:56.000
Darktoseo says, it should be damned. I still want it.

59:56.000 --> 59:58.000
Let's see.

59:58.000 --> 01:00:03.000
Darktoseo reminds us, they say they are working on it for patches and other fixes.

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:11.000
Questbuster says, the only thing I don't like about the PS4 version are some of the loads, especially around saves and reloads.

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000
Otherwise, amazing game.

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:17.000
And YYR says, wait, they already patched it? That means it must have been even worse before.

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:25.000
That's why I'm kind of remembering, I really feel like if you go back to some of the things we talked about around like PAX East this year, I want to say it was the thing.

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:33.000
I want to say that they showed a Bloodstained demo on the floor on the Switch, and that this kind of feedback was coming in, and they kind of said we're already working on a patch.

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:38.000
So I feel like this 1.01 was kind of the post PAX update, perhaps?

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:43.000
I don't know. I mean, obviously I'm not on the inside. I don't know what exactly it is.

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:47.000
But I feel like that might be why the Switch version was already starting to see some patches.

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:55.000
But I still want to play the game. I'm hoping people are just kind of blowing it out of proportion.

01:00:55.000 --> 01:01:01.000
I can deal with a little frame skip here and there, but if it is super jittery throughout the whole thing, it's going to be annoying.

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:07.000
We'll see. Here's hoping. Anyway, let's move on. Another story. Loki.

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:16.000
So where you have many franchises adding Battle Royale to their games, now you have a Battle Royale franchise that's adding a single player campaign.

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:23.000
But why single player? Nobody plays single player games anymore. Single player is dead, I've been told.

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:28.000
But apparently not, because that's what PUBG is going to be doing.

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:34.000
They're working on actually creating an original narrative experience set in the same universe.

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:48.000
Apparently the game is, the single player campaign they're saying is going to be written by Glenn Shulfield, who actually did the original Dead Space.

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:53.000
And I guess has worked on Call of Duty when he was at Sledgehammer Games as well.

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:58.000
So, interesting that that's going to be a thing. I don't know.

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:09.000
By the sounds of this, it almost sounds like it's going to be a separate game, kind of in the same universe, to the effect of Titanfall and Apex Legends, but kind of in the reverse.

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:16.000
So, interesting. I'd be curious to see what this is all about, but...

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:19.000
Single player's dead!

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:31.000
Yeah, isn't it interesting how that whole thing has come full circle? It was like everything had to have a Battle Royale mode, and now it's like, oh, but if your game, you know, like this is only Battle Royale, and maybe PUBG's kind of been eclipsed.

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:37.000
I want to say, I don't want to, because, you know, fans of PUBG are going to be like, there's still a ton of people playing PUBG. Of course there are.

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:45.000
But, you know, a lot of the conversation has been around Fortnite and, you know, other Battle Royale games. Heck, we're talking about another Battle Royale game later in the show that's very unexpected.

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:49.000
Although, I think they're cheating on that one, but I will get to it later.

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:56.000
But anyway, there's a lot of games using the Battle Royale moniker. Tetris 99, which, but that one's really cool, obviously.

01:02:56.000 --> 01:03:07.000
You know, there's a lot of games that are using that Battle Royale thing, and now it's kind of like, okay, maybe PUBG's having a hard time kind of standing out, so it kind of like needs the single player thing to bring people back to it and experience this again.

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:15.000
Like, I think for some people, it's probably like the people that already had it and bought it for Battle Royale, but moved on to Fortnite, moved on to Apex Legends.

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:20.000
It's, oh, I have this new single player mode to check out. I should come on back and check out the game.

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:26.000
And maybe if I come on back and check out the game and stream it to Twitch, other people will check out the game for the first time.

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:30.000
And so I think they're hoping for kind of like a domino effect with that a little bit.

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:39.000
So, Metal Mayhem in chat says, single player is dead. Why wasn't I notified of this? I've pretty much been playing single player stuff exclusively. I guess I was wasting my time.

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:47.000
Well, I mean, that's what big AAA companies have told me. It's funny, because they'll sell you on that, oh, well, single player is dead.

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:53.000
Here's a brand new single player Star Wars game they were putting out as well. They don't fucking know what the hell they're talking about.

01:03:53.000 --> 01:04:01.000
They'll say it one instance, but then at the same time, it's dead. But we're making games for that dead genre anyways, because it's dead.

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:10.000
YYR in chat says, there was actually an analyst who mused recently that the market could be wide open for AAA single player experiences right now.

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:15.000
That gamers are starting to burn out on games as a service and games that are never supposed to end.

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:21.000
Yeah, and I think that's why Final Fantasy VII Remake is coming at a really good time, I think, in some ways.

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:26.000
So, you know, I think, yeah, for sure, like, AAA single player experiences, I think, absolutely are desired.

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:31.000
Hey, YYR, have you ever thought about Snake 360 Royale?

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:34.000
Stop.

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:37.000
I had to ask. I had to ask. Don't hate me.

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:40.000
But think about it.

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:41.000
That's Slither.io at that point.

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:44.000
Think about it. Think about a giant, oh, has that already been done?

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:45.000
That's Slither.io.

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:46.000
God damn it.

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:50.000
Sort of. Slither.io is a little bit different, but it's basically the same thing.

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:54.000
YYR in chat responded with, sometimes less is more, right?

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.000
YYR simply responded with dot, dot, dot.

01:04:58.000 --> 01:04:59.000
Don't indulge him.

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:01.000
Don't indulge me.

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:07.000
Alright, moving on to talk about other ways to maybe bring people back to something

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:12.000
and, you know, remind them of the value of the Switch Online Gaming Library.

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:18.000
You know, it's no secret. Folks would like to see some more on the NES Online Library.

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:19.000
No shit.

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:23.000
We still don't know July's games, do we? We got June's. We haven't gotten to July's yet, right?

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:26.000
Oh, I'm sure it'll be so amazing that I'll have to just come right...

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:30.000
No, it won't. It'll be fucking stupid NES games that no one gives a shit about.

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:31.000
Well...

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.000
Is there another, like, I don't know...

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:36.000
It should be noted that perhaps, you know...

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000
It should be all the Tengen games.

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:44.000
I don't think they could do that, I think because of, you know, lawsuits and things like that.

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:45.000
I know, would that be funny?

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:54.000
Anyway, so in a Japanese interview, Nintendo has actually kind of commented on this whole state of the Switch Online

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:59.000
and, you know, could there be more platforms that come to the Switch Online Library in the future?

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:00.000
And they said to this, quote,

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:05.000
At this place, we cannot tell new information about future classic hardware, among others,

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:08.000
but we are thinking about providing an extension of the online service,

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:12.000
which is currently providing Famicom or NES software, because it's a Japanese interview,

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:15.000
as well as other methods of providing them.

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:19.000
We also recognize that there are opinions wanting to play past titles.

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:23.000
So at least Nintendo is kind of, like, acknowledging that they hear it.

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:32.000
And this theory has come up before on our show, Bobby's show and other shows out there that talk about video games,

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:39.000
is that most people are going to have to re-up their Nintendo Switch Online thing in a year, in, like, October.

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:44.000
So that would be a really good time for Nintendo to put out more bang for, you know,

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:48.000
here's the value you're getting in continuing to be a Nintendo Switch Online subscriber.

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:52.000
So I kind of think that is now the point where we're going to start to see,

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:56.000
oh, the 20 Super Nintendo games or whatever they decide to do are going to come out that month.

01:06:56.000 --> 01:07:01.000
Maybe some other, because it seems like Tetris 99 has done very well for them.

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:04.000
So maybe they'll put out something else.

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:07.000
Mario Battle Royale, since they shut the other one down, right?

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:11.000
I just, I've already made this argument so many times.

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:16.000
I don't even, like, they would have made, I think they would have made so much more money

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:19.000
just doing straight up virtual console than this crap.

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:26.000
Honestly, I mean, I don't even know why they didn't do it, because they would make just so much money.

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:31.000
They could still have the online service and give you a couple free games or an access to a library of games,

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:35.000
but then separately just have virtual console where you can purchase, like,

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:38.000
Super Nintendo games and other stuff that people wanted to get,

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:42.000
and they would make so much more money than they're making on this online service.

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:45.000
Like, how much is a year? Is it, like, 20 bucks a year or something like that?

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:46.000
Yeah.

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:49.000
That's like two fucking games on virtual console.

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:56.000
Like, it's stupid. It doesn't make any fucking sense that they're doing it this way.

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:59.000
Like, I don't get it.

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:03.000
This Switch is obviously powerful enough to run Super Nintendo games.

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:08.000
The Wii was. I mean, come on. I don't understand why they would do this.

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:11.000
Unless they're really going to amp up the emulator.

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:15.000
Like, maybe some type of, like, shared scoreboard amongst your friends or something.

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000
I mean, I know. Don't hold your fucking breath.

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:21.000
But it could be something that maybe the emulator's going to get kicked up.

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:25.000
Like, it's going to be more surprising what it does. I don't know.

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:26.000
I'm trying to give them something.

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:30.000
Other emulators out there have already done this shit, like, long time ago.

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:33.000
Like, probably a decade ago, this stuff has been in place.

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:39.000
And Nintendo's now just, like, thinking about, maybe we'll do this or maybe we'll do this.

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:42.000
It's, like, it's so dumb. I don't even understand.

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000
They're literally leaving money on the table.

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:48.000
As Joe and Hunter Matt points out, we got skunked at E3 with online news.

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.000
I wish we'd get a direct about any updates.

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:53.000
You know, I've thought about this and the fact that they tend to,

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:58.000
and the E3s do tend to be pretty absent of online updates and things like that.

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:01.000
And I think, you know, I think I'm okay with it at this point

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:04.000
because you have to really think about what is E3 supposed to be.

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:09.000
It is a trade show at its core that is supposed to be kind of promoting

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:12.000
what the retail lineup is going to be at the end of the year

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000
and what you're going to be able to find on store shelves.

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:17.000
And this type of thing, you know, even though, yes,

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:20.000
the industry is starting to move more and more towards digital and all that,

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:24.000
this sort of thing is not really something that is, like,

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:28.000
they need to show off to a third party or get other people interested in it.

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.000
It's very kind of, like, in-house.

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:33.000
And so they only need to get their fans on board with it.

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:36.000
How do they reach out to their fans? By doing a direct.

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.000
Does that make sense? What I'm saying is that the Switch Online

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:41.000
is not something that ends up on a store shelf, essentially.

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:45.000
So maybe they don't feel like E3 is the time to be doing that

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:48.000
because it is very much something that they just kind of do in-house

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.000
and then, blip, put it out there when it's done

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:53.000
and there's no middleman, no nothing. Does that make sense?

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:57.000
That makes sense. They do this all, I mean, they don't put everything out,

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.000
like, during E3 anyways.

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.000
And I don't think they even did that for online last year.

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:06.000
It was more towards, I think it was a few weeks away from when they launched in September.

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:11.000
So I expect that we'll see something kind of in the middle of August anyways

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:14.000
for online, kind of an update or whatever.

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:17.000
We'll probably have a couple more directs between then.

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:22.000
It's just, it's disappointing, though, that we don't know what's coming out.

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:25.000
And it's just, I don't know, like, if they're just like,

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.000
we're going to launch Super Nintendo games.

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:30.000
Like, at this point, I'm not even really that excited about it.

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:34.000
Like, I have a Super NES Mini or whatever.

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:38.000
Like, the only thing I can think of them holding off on doing, like, more NES games and stuff

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:43.000
is that they're planning on releasing a version 2 of those with different games on them

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:48.000
and maybe do that. I mean, but I don't know who that's even for at that point.

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.000
I mean, I don't know.

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:54.000
Well, let's travel back to a simpler time.

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:58.000
Let's travel back to a console that's so old

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:03.000
that we were seeing ports of games on it and emulation.

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:07.000
Like, probably at the time, most people did own only a Super Nintendo and things like that.

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:10.000
In our segment, the classic game of the week.

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:13.000
Usually, Dark Sakura steps into the gaming vault and pulls out a game that she thinks,

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:16.000
hey, you guys should check out this game. You should play this game this week.

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.000
But she is not here tonight, of course.

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:23.000
She has the night off as she is celebrating Pride in San Francisco with her sisters this weekend.

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:26.000
So, usually, I would bring a guest on.

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:28.000
I've really been trying to do that in 2019.

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:33.000
But since I cut it so close today with me being out of town and doing other things,

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:34.000
I didn't even get to do that.

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:36.000
So, I'm picking one myself tonight.

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.000
So, I'm doing a way, way throwback.

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:41.000
And we haven't really spotlighted enough games on this console.

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:46.000
So, I picked a game tonight from the Atari 2600.

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:50.000
And so, my classic game of the week we're doing tonight is

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:57.000
an old game by Activision that's called Oink.

01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:58.000
So, there it is.

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:02.000
Oink is the game that we're going to look at tonight.

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:05.000
And the sound kind of gets really annoying.

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:08.000
So, I'm going to turn it way down so it doesn't get too crazy here.

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:11.000
So, Oink was an Atari 2600 video game.

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:14.000
And the designer behind the game was Mike Lorenzen.

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:17.000
And then Activision did the release in the year 1983.

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:20.000
Oink is the Three Little Pigs, basically.

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:22.000
It's a video game based around the Three Little Pigs.

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.000
For those that can see the video on Twitch right now,

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:28.000
you'll notice the brick building, quote-unquote brick building, is yellow.

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:30.000
It's supposed to represent straw.

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:32.000
The next level is brown.

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:33.000
It represents sticks.

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:36.000
And then the last level is red because it represents bricks.

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:37.000
Get it? It's like the fable.

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:40.000
And this is kind of like a reverse breakout sort of thing.

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:43.000
So, you have the pig, and you're playing the pig at the top,

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:49.000
that is trying to fill in the holes that are being blown up by the wolf.

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:51.000
Now, the wolf, I say reverse breakout.

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.000
It's not like the wolf is bouncing a hole around.

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:56.000
But the wolf is kind of shooting this laser beam

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:59.000
that is supposed to be representative of the wolf's breath.

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.000
And he can only fire it every so often.

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:05.000
And he uses that to actually knock out the bricks

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:09.000
probably a slight bit faster than you can actually lay them down.

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:14.000
He can also, with that little stream, his little laser beam, his breath,

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:19.000
he can actually pull the pig down to the bottom of the board.

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:21.000
So, that way the pig has to take a few seconds,

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:24.000
a few valuable seconds to run back up

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:27.000
and actually replace, you know, to get the bricks to keep replacing.

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:32.000
And if the wolf can succeed in pulling the pig down all the way

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.000
through like a complete opening in there,

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.000
because you can see again on the Twitch video,

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:38.000
the wolf is about to like make a big enough opening

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:41.000
where if he grabs the pig, the pig is going to come completely full,

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:45.000
completely through, then the round is over and it goes on to the next house.

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.000
So, that is essentially the game.

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.000
I know I make it sound very complicated,

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:52.000
but just imagine like a reverse breakout where you are laying down the bricks.

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:57.000
The wolf has a name in the story, Bigelow B. Wolf, or B.B. Wolf.

01:13:57.000 --> 01:14:03.000
And again, you have three houses and the bricks are three layers deep.

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:06.000
And if you get pulled completely through,

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:07.000
which I think is going to happen on the Twitch stream here in a minute,

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:09.000
because that hole is getting really big,

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:13.000
then that round is over and you are going to start a new round here.

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:17.000
You get four points when you put a brick down on the wall.

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:21.000
And if you, you have to use every, there he goes, see he got pulled through,

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:25.000
so now he is going to run off and now the straw one is going to come in here,

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.000
so now he is down to one life basically.

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:29.000
And I think it goes a little bit faster with each board.

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:31.000
And I think you get more points too.

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:35.000
I think it is four points the first time and then like as each new row comes in,

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:37.000
you get like a multiplier basically.

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:40.000
So the wolf attacks also speed up.

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:43.000
So you can't keep this going forever really.

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:47.000
Now here is the thing that a lot of people don't realize about this game

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:52.000
and what I think makes it actually really notable is because,

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:56.000
and even the Wiki article doesn't talk about this, which I found very surprising.

01:14:56.000 --> 01:15:01.000
You have to actually kind of dig a little deeper or remember this mode like I do.

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.000
If you actually can find a copy of the game manual,

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:06.000
the game manual explains how there are actually three game modes.

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:09.000
Because remember the Atari had that switch which recycled the different game modes.

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:13.000
So game mode number one is one player versus the wolf.

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:17.000
Game mode number two is take turns controlling each pig,

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:19.000
two players versus the wolf.

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:24.000
But here is where I think this game really shined was game number three.

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:28.000
One player controls the pig, one player controls the wolf.

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:32.000
And so it was really like an early example that I can think of,

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:36.000
of like a player versus player type of thing in video games

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:40.000
where the players had two completely different types of mechanics.

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:41.000
Does that make sense?

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:42.000
Yeah.

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:44.000
So yeah, I think that's what made this game kind of notable

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:47.000
and one reason that I wanted to spotlight it tonight

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:52.000
is because it was really like a different type of battle your friends type of game.

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:54.000
And I do remember playing this game with my friends

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:58.000
and we would battle and see who could get the higher score

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:00.000
and it was what we did

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:03.000
because that's as far progressed as the video games were at that point.

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:07.000
So you can also use difficulty switches.

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:11.000
In the A position your pigs have to walk down to the wall to drop an object in place.

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:14.000
In the B position they can drop objects from anywhere on the screen.

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:17.000
So the A position is a lot harder.

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:20.000
Anyway, for those that did continue to play in the single player mode,

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:24.000
in the single player mode if you were able to score, I think it was 25,000 points,

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:29.000
you could take the picture of your TV screen and get the old school achievements,

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:32.000
the actual patches that Activision would mail you

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:34.000
for you to put on, I don't know, your jacket or whatever,

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:38.000
and you get an oinker's patch.

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:43.000
So as far as a lot of the follow up and reception and so forth,

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:49.000
apparently Oink got an award of the most humorous video game computer game in 1984.

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:51.000
I guess it's funny. I don't know.

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:54.000
I mean a video game called Oink is kind of funny.

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:56.000
They could have called the game The Three Little Pigs

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:58.000
and it would have made just as much sense,

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:00.000
but instead they called it Oink.

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:02.000
You know, squeal like a pig I guess.

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:04.000
If you would like to check out this game,

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:07.000
you could check out a collection called the Activision Anthology,

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:11.000
but otherwise I don't know if this one shows up on the flashback consoles.

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:14.000
I think I have seen it on some of those Atari flashback consoles,

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:17.000
the one that included Atari 2600 games,

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:20.000
but it's missing from a lot of them.

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:27.000
So anyway, I'm looking in chat over at twitch.tv slash vognetwork.

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:30.000
Darktichia says, whoa, a competitive mode.

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:31.000
Okay, that's neat.

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:34.000
Yeah, it's kind of what made it special a little bit, I think,

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:36.000
and worthy of highlighting this week.

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:39.000
And PixelPaka says, the oinker's patch is cute.

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:41.000
It sure is.

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.000
And definitely would have a whole new meaning for some people.

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:45.000
Just putting it out there.

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:48.000
Metal Mayhem says, I never had this game for the 2600.

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:52.000
I don't think this was as well known, and that's part of the reason.

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:58.000
Activision had a lot of real big games for the Atari 2600.

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:02.000
River Raid, Pitfall certainly was a big one.

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:03.000
They had a lot.

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:06.000
I don't think Oink was ever really one of their big successes,

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:09.000
but I think, again, because of this two-player mode that I was talking about,

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:11.000
it's a pretty big deal that I think is worth spotlighting.

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:12.000
So there you go.

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:13.000
Oh, Kaboom! Thank you, YYR.

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:14.000
Yeah, there's a lot of them.

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:18.000
And YYR says, this game looks great, and I'm sad I never heard about it until now.

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:19.000
Thank you.

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:21.000
I'm happy to help educate.

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:24.000
That's part of what we do here at Orange Lounge Radio

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:26.000
in the Classic Game of the Week.

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:29.000
Now you guys are all naming all the Atari games I'm forgetting.

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:32.000
H-E-R-O, Keystone Capers, yes, yes.

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:34.000
I'm going to cross my fingers and toes.

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:36.000
Maybe some of those will show up on Antstream or something.

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:38.000
I don't think Antstream has the Atari 2600 stuff yet,

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:41.000
but hopefully that's something they're going to grow to in the future.

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:44.000
Well, that's supposed to be the Atari console that they've got.

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:45.000
Oh, yeah.

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:46.000
Well, after that.

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:48.000
Well, they still may put it on there.

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:50.000
Technically, these are Activision's games, too,

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:51.000
so you never know what will happen.

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:52.000
That's true.

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:55.000
And actually, speaking of Antstream real quick,

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:58.000
their official launch is tomorrow in the UK,

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:01.000
so they actually aren't launching in the US right away.

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:03.000
They're going to start in the UK, because that's where they're based.

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:06.000
But I guess us early backers, and disclosure, I'm a backer,

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:08.000
that got in in the US, we get to keep it,

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:10.000
but they're going to start the new game releases coming up pretty soon.

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:11.000
Oh, cool.

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:14.000
When are they launching officially everything?

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:15.000
For the UK? Tomorrow.

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:16.000
Oh, US, too.

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:17.000
They haven't set it for the US yet.

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:20.000
So they're doing that for non-backers, too, at some point?

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:21.000
Yeah.

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:23.000
Non-backers in the UK can get in tomorrow, basically.

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:24.000
Cool.

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:28.000
So they haven't said if we're talking months, weeks, or what.

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:31.000
I imagine they want to launch, make sure it's smooth, stable,

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:32.000
all that good stuff.

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:35.000
And then I don't think the US will wait that long.

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:37.000
So we'll see, though.

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:40.000
Anyway, all right.

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:41.000
Let's move on.

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:43.000
Sadly, no video segment this week.

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:46.000
I didn't have time to make one with everything else going on,

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:48.000
although Loki's looking at doing some stuff, right?

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:51.000
Yeah, I was going to do some stuff, but I haven't filmed anything yet.

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:54.000
I will use this opportunity to give you guys a reminder.

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:57.000
We played a little promotional video at the beginning of the stream tonight,

01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:59.000
and we will play it again at the end,

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:04.000
just because VOG Network is a sponsor of the Southern Fried Game Room Expo

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:07.000
that's coming up in the Atlanta area this July.

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:12.000
And Bobby Black Wolf is going to be there in person and attending the festival.

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:15.000
And so if you are in the Southeast, if you're in the Atlanta area,

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:18.000
you want to play some old-school video games, maybe they'll have Oink.

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:20.000
Who knows? I bet you they've got some consoles set up and stuff,

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:23.000
but I know they do a lot of arcade, a lot of pinball.

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:26.000
I did see the Atari flashback in that promo video.

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:27.000
Yeah, and there's a lot.

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:29.000
They had Rasslin in there, too, because...

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:30.000
That's weird.

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:32.000
Why not? Well, why not? DragonCon has Rasslin.

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:33.000
Oh, okay.

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:35.000
I guess there's a lot of crossover. Why not?

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:36.000
But anyway, that's happening.

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:38.000
I believe the dates are the 12th through the 14th in the Atlanta area.

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:41.000
We just want to shout them out, because VOG Network is a sponsor of that.

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:44.000
And shit, we just love old-school video games.

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:47.000
So a convention set up to love old-school video games

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:50.000
and maybe a few new-school ones, too, and throw in some Rasslin as well.

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:52.000
Hey, we're on board.

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:55.000
So check that out and go say hi to Bobby Black Wolf.

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:58.000
If you can't make that, I really hope you will try to make DragonCon,

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:01.000
which I will be at and Bobby will be at.

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:04.000
And if you're a longtime fan of VOG and you remember shows like

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:06.000
Guys on a Show or Hoard House,

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:09.000
Xtaphir will be at DragonCon this year for the very first time.

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:15.000
Travis Donovan is back at, I hope, well wishes Travis Donovan out there,

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:17.000
by the way, if you're out there.

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:19.000
I don't know how much of his business I can put out there,

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:24.000
but he had a routine surgery that is completely normal

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:25.000
and just well wishes.

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:26.000
I hope he's doing well.

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:28.000
As far as I know, we'll still make DragonCon,

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:30.000
because he's got plenty of time to recover and all that good stuff.

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:35.000
So yeah, so lots of VOG personalities.

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:38.000
I don't remember if Brian from British Invaders is going this year

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:40.000
or John from Critical Myth.

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:41.000
I haven't checked on the status of those.

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:43.000
I'm sure Gary from Critical Myth will be there.

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:45.000
I know some of these shows have sunsetted,

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:48.000
but it's still good to see them and hang out once a year.

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:50.000
So DragonCon is coming up as well, Labor Day weekend.

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:51.000
Very excited.

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:54.000
I don't know how much I'm allowed to say yet,

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:59.000
but I will say that I have seen an early draft of what Bobby and I

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:01.000
are going to be involved with.

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:04.000
And like last year, we did several panels and stuff,

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:07.000
so you can probably guess there's going to be a similar thing

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:08.000
going on this year.

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:12.000
And I'm really excited about some of the stuff I'm seeing.

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:15.000
There are some panels this year, especially one for me,

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:18.000
where I'm like, I'm hyped about this.

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:19.000
This is going to be great.

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:22.000
So I'll tease you with that and more details to come in future weeks.

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:24.000
Okay, now we'll get back into some gaming news

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:27.000
and tackle some rapid-fire news.

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:31.000
All right, so let's talk about some stuff we're going to get for free.

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:35.000
Well, not necessarily free, because you're paying for those online services.

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:37.000
But Games of Gold and PlayStation Plus.

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:40.000
So Games of Gold in July.

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:44.000
We are getting Inside from July 1st to the 31st,

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:49.000
and Big Crown Showdown from July 16th through the 15th.

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:52.000
And then on the Xbox 360 backwards compatible games,

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:56.000
Castlevania Symphony of the Night from July 1st through the 15th,

01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:58.000
and then the really old movie tie-in,

01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:03.000
Meet the Robinsons from July 16th through the 31st.

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:06.000
It was an okay movie. I liked it.

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:11.000
You know, I talked to someone recently that had not played Castlevania Symphony of the Night,

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:14.000
and I was trying to explain, like, Bloodstained,

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:18.000
because it was a game that I had planned to play that evening and never got around to.

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:20.000
And I was like, oh, it's kind of like Castlevania Symphony of the Night,

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:22.000
and this person I was talking to didn't really know about it.

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:25.000
And I was like, oh, man, you got to check it out if you ever have time.

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:28.000
And then it was so funny that this came up today.

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:32.000
I saw this, and I was like, oh, shit, this would be nice if this person has an Xbox.

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:35.000
They're going to be able to get it for free coming up here soon, so it's pretty cool.

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:39.000
PlayStation Plus, we're going to be getting two games, of course.

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:46.000
So Pro Evolution Soccer 2019 and Horizon Chase Zero

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:50.000
are going to be the two games that we get for PlayStation.

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:52.000
I know not everybody's into Pro Evo Soccer,

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:55.000
but it's nice to kind of see a sports game that's happening.

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:59.000
Okay, so Mr. Smoosh is exploring the kitchen counter.

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:03.000
I need to go discourage him from doing so because he's getting a little, yeah.

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:06.000
So, Loki, if you wouldn't mind just buying me some time.

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:07.000
Sure, of course.

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:09.000
Ah, cats.

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:13.000
Anyways, and then let's talk a little bit about Crackdown 3,

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:16.000
a game I haven't been back to since I originally beat it.

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:18.000
But now I have a reason to go back

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:22.000
because there's going to be a brand new update coming to it pretty soon.

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:25.000
It's called the Flying High update,

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:29.000
and it adds a wingsuit into the game,

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:36.000
as well as apparently some other updates or other achievements.

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:40.000
So 16 achievements, totaling 500 gamer score.

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:42.000
And I don't know what else.

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:45.000
Oh, the Agency Peacekeeper Beacon,

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:49.000
which you can use for callings in civilian backup.

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:51.000
And they said an elemental forge,

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:55.000
and a hellstorm flare for air strikes,

01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:58.000
and some cluster duck grenade.

01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:00.000
Cluster duck?

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:04.000
Well, yeah, they had kind of a silly thing with the original Crackdown game.

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:06.000
I think it was a pre-order bonus or something like that

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:09.000
where you get an exploding rubber duck,

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:12.000
and you can use that as a grenade.

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:15.000
But, I don't know.

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:17.000
I'll check it out.

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:20.000
Meh.

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:22.000
And that's what they wrote.

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:23.000
Meh.

01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:24.000
I still need to play Crackdown 3.

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:27.000
I have the Xbox Pass now, so I just...

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:28.000
Yeah, you should try it.

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:30.000
Add that to the fucking list of games I need to catch up on.

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:32.000
It's all right, but I got a LARP.

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:36.000
It's only a few hours to beat the game.

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:38.000
And it's good, and you're just like, eh, cool.

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:41.000
Well, ironically, we were talking about Battle Royale games earlier,

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:43.000
and there's another one coming out, Tetris Royale.

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:47.000
Wait a minute. Don't we already have Tetris Battle Royale?

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:49.000
Of course we do. Tetris 99, of course.

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:51.000
But there's a new one coming out.

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:53.000
Maybe because of the success of Tetris 99.

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:55.000
I don't know. Tetris Royale.

01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:57.000
Tetris Royale is a cell phone game.

01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:59.000
It's an iOS Android game. It's not a Switch game.

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:01.000
So that's, ah, there's the difference there.

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:03.000
Tetris Royale is what they call it in the UK

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:05.000
because they're on the metric system.

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:07.000
They don't have a quarter pound. Yes, yes.

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:10.000
Anyway, no footage right now

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:12.000
because I guess it's early on or whatever.

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:14.000
But of course Tetris Royale, they are saying

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:16.000
we'll have a variety of game modes from

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:18.000
100 players, not 99, but 100 players

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:20.000
battling Tetris with each other

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:22.000
to daily competitions

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:24.000
and so on and so on.

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:26.000
I think the, ah,

01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:28.000
who is developing this one?

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:30.000
It's not the same developers.

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:32.000
Because the developers of Tetris 99

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:34.000
are also the people behind the Grandmaster.

01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:36.000
And they are not doing this one.

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:38.000
So somebody else kind of licensed Tetris.

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:40.000
Let's hope it's not Ubisoft.

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:42.000
No, it's not. It's not Ubisoft. It's somebody else.

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:44.000
Ah, and, um,

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:46.000
oh, okay, no, it is Network.

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:48.000
N3 TWORK.

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:50.000
That's doing it because they

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:52.000
got the multi-year contract to

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:54.000
exclusively develop and publish

01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:56.000
new Tetris games built from the ground up

01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:58.000
for mobile devices worldwide

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:00.000
excluding China.

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:02.000
So. I would have been really

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:04.000
interested in this if this was Hatris

01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:06.000
Battle Royale, but, you know. Or FaceTris?

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:08.000
FaceTris. Or WordTris?

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:10.000
Uh,

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:12.000
Nifty 805 is asking, don't you all have

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:14.000
phones?

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:16.000
It's the hot new way to play, ah, Tetris.

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:18.000
So. Ah, DarkTitsu, you're reminding

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:20.000
us the name of the developer of Tetris 99

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:22.000
who I failed to mention. Ah, Arica.

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:24.000
Is, ah, the developer that did

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:26.000
Tetris 99, so. And ActDeft

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:28.000
in chat saying, we need a new Tetris Grandmaster

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:30.000
dammit. Ah, I think there'd be a lot of people

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:32.000
happy to see that if that actually happened over here.

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:34.000
You know, the good news is Switch is region free, so they

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:36.000
did it on the Switch and they even put it out only in Japan

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:38.000
and you can still kind of get it here. And it's Tetris,

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:40.000
so you wouldn't have to have a deep understanding of Japanese.

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:42.000
We'll see. I don't know.

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:44.000
Anyway. Ah, moving

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:46.000
on to talking about, oh, this is interesting.

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:48.000
This is a follow up to the little

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:50.000
Commodore 64 mini that you got me last week.

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:52.000
Which, thanks again. No problem.

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:54.000
Um, and, ah, you mentioned it was on a deep

01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:56.000
discount, which is part of the reason why you got it.

01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:58.000
You're like, oh, I'll get it now. And I said, I think

01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:00.000
it's because they're making a new one. Well, guess what, Logie?

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:02.000
They're making a new one. So,

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:04.000
the deal is, is that they're putting out a

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:06.000
new version with a full size

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:08.000
keyboard and they're simply calling it

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:10.000
the C64 micro

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:12.000
computer. It's going to have the

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:14.000
same 64 games in it, but

01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:16.000
this time the keyboard is fully sized

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:18.000
and fully functional. So you don't have to use

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:20.000
like a separate USB keyboard to get

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:22.000
in there and actually do the typing. You use that keyboard.

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:24.000
What's also interesting about it, in my

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:26.000
opinion, is that it is going to emulate not

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:28.000
just Commodore 64, but

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:30.000
VIC-20. So, which

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:32.000
was kind of the predecessor

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:34.000
to Commodore 64. No word

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:36.000
on Commodore 128

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:38.000
or the, what was the other one,

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:40.000
the 16 plus

01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:42.000
4C or whatever the other one was.

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:44.000
There was another Commodore

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:46.000
that came out. I don't think it did well here at all.

01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:48.000
When did we get our Amiga?

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:50.000
Hell yeah!

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:52.000
Why not an Amiga thing? I don't know, we'll see.

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:54.000
Well, that's the platform,

01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:56.000
that's the thing, and stream

01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:58.000
has a lot of Amiga stuff in it right now.

01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:00.000
So, you can't

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:02.000
get your Amiga life through that.

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:04.000
I mean, a lot of the stuff that was big in the UK.

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:06.000
Amiga, Spectrum, they have some Commodore 64

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:08.000
in there as well. You know,

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:10.000
the Amstream retro stuff is covering a lot of that.

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:12.000
So, anyway, otherwise it's going to be pretty

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:14.000
much similar to the

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:16.000
Commodore 64 mini that's already out,

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:18.000
but the larger keyboard is definitely going to be a game

01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:20.000
changer. The resolution output is

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:22.000
maxed at 720p, so sorry

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:24.000
you will not be able to play games in 4K

01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:26.000
all of a sudden. December 5th, 2019

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:28.000
is supposedly the day that this new one

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:30.000
is going to ship. So that is still

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:32.000
a little ways out, but just about close enough.

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:34.000
Considering the resolution of what it is

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:36.000
anyways, 720p

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:38.000
upscale to 4K is going to

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:40.000
look the same, I would imagine.

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:42.000
And it's Commodore 64, it's just like

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:44.000
the edges get edgier,

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:46.000
that's about it, right?

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:48.000
Alright, anyhow.

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:50.000
Moving on

01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:52.000
and talking about

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:54.000
what's going to come out in stores near

01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:56.000
you very soon as we travel around the world

01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:58.000
and look at world release dates.

01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:00.000
So, the US, Loki.

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:02.000
So, of course, as you're aware, Final Fantasy XIV Shadowbringers

01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:04.000
is going to be coming out this week on PC and

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:06.000
PlayStation 4. Officially.

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:08.000
Alternate Jake Hunter

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:10.000
Daedalus, The Awakening of the Golden Jazz.

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:14.000
I have no idea what the fuck that is,

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:16.000
but that's an amazing title.

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:18.000
Coming out on PC.

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:20.000
Stranger Things 3, the game.

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:22.000
That's coming out on PC, PlayStation 4,

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:24.000
Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch.

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:26.000
Also the show coming out on the 4th as well.

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:28.000
Clonad on

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:30.000
Nintendo Switch. The Ninja Warriors

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:32.000
once again on Nintendo

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:34.000
Switch and PlayStation 4.

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:36.000
Attack on Titan 2, Final

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:38.000
Battle on PlayStation 4,

01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:40.000
Xbox One, Switch, and PC.

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:42.000
Sea of Solitude on

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:44.000
PC,

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:46.000
PlayStation 4, and

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:48.000
Xbox One. And

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:50.000
that's it.

01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:52.000
Alright, traveling over to Japan real quick.

01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:54.000
A pretty similar lineup

01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:56.000
with Final Fantasy XIV, of course,

01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:58.000
making its way in Japan officially

01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:00.000
this week on the 2nd. The same day

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:02.000
it's out everywhere else officially.

01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:04.000
But there's just a

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:06.000
few releases here on July 4th in

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:08.000
Japan. Remember, it's a holiday

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:10.000
in the US, but not Japan. So they get game releases

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:12.000
on July 4th. So the

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:14.000
games coming out on PS4 are

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:16.000
Pixark and

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:18.000
Shingeki no Kaioshin 2

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:20.000
Final Battle from Koei

01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:22.000
Tecmo is the big release.

01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:24.000
Attack on Titan 2. That's it.

01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:26.000
Those are the big releases on the PlayStation 4.

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:28.000
And then the Switch, those

01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:30.000
exact same games, but that

01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:32.000
Clonad game is the other big release in

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:34.000
Japan this week. So kind of a lot of overlap

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:36.000
this week. How about the UK?

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:38.000
UK, we've got

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:40.000
looks like Red Faction

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:42.000
Guerrilla Remarse edition

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:44.000
that's going to be coming out.

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:46.000
We've got, oh that's

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:48.000
on Nintendo Switch. Final Fantasy

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:50.000
XIV Shadowbringers on

01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:52.000
PC and PlayStation 4.

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:54.000
Attack on Titan 2. The Final Battle

01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:56.000
on PC, PlayStation, I'm sorry

01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:58.000
PlayStation 4, Xbox One and

01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:00.000
Switch. Tour de France on

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:02.000
Xbox One.

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:04.000
We have Sirento

01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:06.000
VR on PlayStation 4.

01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:08.000
And that's it.

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:10.000
Alright. Let's move on

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:12.000
to the mailbag. Every week we invite you

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:14.000
to email us. Participate at

01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:16.000
orangelandre.com and we read

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:18.000
your emails here live on the show.

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:20.000
I think we just have one quick one

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:22.000
tonight coming in this week from

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:24.000
Redertainment. So yeah,

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:26.000
Redertainment sent us an email this week to participate

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:28.000
at orangelandre.com and I

01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:30.000
encourage you to email us. Fill up that mailbag

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:32.000
who says, hello peoples.

01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:34.000
I'm at Salt Lake Gaming Con

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:36.000
and there's a pinball table that is really

01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:38.000
outstanding to me. It's Genie

01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:40.000
by Gottlieb. It's a

01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:42.000
four player competitive old style

01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:44.000
multi flipper table.

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:46.000
It's the kind of thing that I would buy if I had the space

01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:48.000
and money. And that is signed from

01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:50.000
Redertainment saying this message was

01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:52.000
brought to you by cool shit you only

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:54.000
see at cons. He actually sent a little

01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:56.000
picture. It's a little bit low resolution for me

01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:58.000
to actually show on the stream

01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:00.000
and it ended up coming through tilted sideways.

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:02.000
But it is one of those old school like

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:04.000
70's-ish kind of machines.

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:06.000
I believe I've played this table

01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:08.000
and I think I played it recently when I was at the pinball

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:10.000
Hall of Fame in Vegas

01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:12.000
which I talked about several weeks ago.

01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:14.000
God, it was probably closer to the end

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:16.000
of last year. No, where the hell was I

01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:18.000
in Vegas? I can't remember anymore.

01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:20.000
But yeah, it was closer to the end of last year I think.

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:22.000
I played it recently when I was there.

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:24.000
And yeah, I'll pass that along

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:26.000
to Jamie because she'll get a kick out of that.

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:28.000
But yeah, old school pinball tables.

01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:30.000
It's always kind of fun to go back and discover stuff

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:32.000
especially in that 70. You know, because

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:34.000
a lot of like, if you play this stuff from like the 60's

01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:36.000
and you know, they're really

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:38.000
old and they're cool.

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:40.000
They still have a lot of like replay value

01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:42.000
and stuff. There's just not as much

01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:44.000
going on necessarily.

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:46.000
But you know, you really start to see

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:48.000
that phase when things started going from the

01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:50.000
little spinning numbers to the digital numbers

01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:52.000
and the boards started getting more digital

01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:54.000
themselves and more lights and things like that.

01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:56.000
Like there's just a lot of like neat stuff that

01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:58.000
came out such as you know, multi flippers

01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:00.000
and things like that. So yeah, very

01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:02.000
cool. So I'm glad. It sounds like this

01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:04.000
Salt Lake Con that

01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:06.000
Retertainment was at is probably very similar to like

01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:08.000
Southern Fry Game Room Expo and there's probably many

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:10.000
cons like it in cities throughout America

01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:12.000
where you can go experience some of these

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:14.000
things. So, pretty cool.

01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:16.000
But that wasn't really our only email

01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:18.000
this week. So participate at

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:20.000
orangelaundry.com if you would like to send us

01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:22.000
an email for a future week. Hey, we don't mind

01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:24.000
the shout outs of things that you guys see

01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:26.000
at Gaming Cons. We really love

01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:28.000
video though, because then we can put that

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:30.000
in the middle of our show. So think about that.

01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:32.000
Anyway, don't you all have cell phones?

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:34.000
Don't they all shoot video?

01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:36.000
Alright.

01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:38.000
All that aside, let's move on and

01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:40.000
talk about some more headlines,

01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:42.000
some things we've kind of referenced so

01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:44.000
far. Right, Logie? Yes. So speaking

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:46.000
of cell phones, if you have a cell phone

01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:48.000
you can check out Flappy

01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:50.000
Royale. It is a

01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:52.000
battle royale flappy

01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:54.000
bird type game. I use

01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:56.000
air quotes because it's not necessarily

01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:58.000
that you're battling each other. This is battle royale

01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:00.000
as in the same as the Mario

01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:02.000
battle royale was battle royale

01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:04.000
where you're playing at the same time

01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:06.000
trying to accomplish something

01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:08.000
but

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:10.000
it's a flappy bird so you're probably going to die pretty

01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:12.000
fast. Yes. And

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:14.000
for one, it's not easy

01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:16.000
to get on iOS. You have to

01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:18.000
do the whole test flight thing

01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:20.000
which I've only ever used when I

01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:22.000
was in the Pokemon Go beta so long

01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:24.000
ago for being a high level Ingress player. I installed

01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:26.000
test flight and I've since uninstalled it because I didn't

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:28.000
need it for anything else. But you can

01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:30.000
play it in a browser window. That's

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:32.000
how I played it. So I did play this

01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:34.000
earlier just to check it out.

01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:36.000
And one thing that I noticed when I played it

01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:38.000
is that there's no

01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:40.000
way that you're actually

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:42.000
matching live with other people. There's

01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:44.000
no way that's happening because

01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:46.000
if you fuck up, you go right

01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:48.000
back into it. So I think

01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:50.000
what it is, it's probably downloading

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:52.000
99 other shadows.

01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:54.000
I'm not saying it's like a fake battle royale.

01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:56.000
It might be, but I would

01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:58.000
see maybe that, and like you said, this Mario

01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:00.000
thing that Nintendo pulled I think was like this

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:02.000
is that you're basically running against

01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:04.000
99 shadows of

01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:06.000
other people running. And I think

01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:08.000
that's probably what's really happening, but it's

01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:10.000
not happening live like it

01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:12.000
would be in a game like Fortnite or

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:14.000
even Tetris 99.

01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:16.000
But I thought it was a hilarious concept.

01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:18.000
I mean, just the whole image, and

01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:20.000
if you kind of Google this game, the

01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:22.000
Flappy Royal,

01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:24.000
you can actually see

01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:26.000
it's so funny. I love the bus.

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:28.000
I love the bus idea. They show up at the bus.

01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:30.000
But then you just see this swarm of birds, it looks

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:32.000
like fucking bees flying everywhere

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:34.000
coming out of the bus. You can't even see like

01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:36.000
who you would be. I guess yours is...

01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:38.000
Yours is a lot, like you can

01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:40.000
actually design your character. So you can actually

01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:42.000
my bird looks like Opa Opa from

01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:44.000
Fantasy Zone. And then you can actually, like he

01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:46.000
wears a little hat. So you can actually like customize

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:48.000
a little bit. And the one you're controlling

01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:50.000
does stand out a little

01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:52.000
more. Like the colors are all filled in a bit

01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:54.000
more. So

01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:56.000
it's, it's cute.

01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:58.000
But I don't think

01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:00.000
it's quite

01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:02.000
live battle royale. But I think

01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:04.000
this, I mean this is probably done by

01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:06.000
did you say it was one or two developers?

01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:08.000
Like it's probably just like a couple of people

01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:10.000
who did this. Yeah, I didn't say who it was. It was

01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:12.000
basically

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:14.000
they have like three

01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:16.000
developers. Designers Orta,

01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:18.000
Fearox, M. Laser

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:20.000
Walker, and Zach Gage.

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:22.000
So four people.

01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:24.000
Akuma JV says what? Rob's bird looks like what?

01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:26.000
The lead ship from Fantasy Zone.

01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:28.000
There's like a clone of that

01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:30.000
in the game. So.

01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:32.000
Alright.

01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:34.000
Yeah, it's one of those things you

01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:36.000
play. Oh that's cute. And then you

01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:38.000
probably won't really play again. But you

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:40.000
never know. I mean we'll see.

01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:42.000
Maybe this is a great start.

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:44.000
And especially if it's only on Test Flight and things like

01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:46.000
that. Maybe the developers

01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:48.000
will think about, oh a way you can battle

01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:50.000
against your friend's shadows. Or

01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:52.000
you know certain courses that are already

01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:54.000
laid out. Like there might be ways

01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:56.000
to take this concept and make

01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:58.000
it much more than something you play once

01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:00.000
and go oh cute and then never play again.

01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:02.000
Which I think the original Flappy Bird was

01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:04.000
for a lot of people. But a lot of people

01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:06.000
played that Flappy Bird.

01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:08.000
That's one of those amazing

01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:10.000
kind of mysteries in video games to this day.

01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:12.000
Why did that guy

01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:14.000
just pull Flappy Bird when he could have kept making

01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:16.000
so much money off of it. And he

01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:18.000
ended up releasing more games.

01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:20.000
After that he just

01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:22.000
and I don't know if he licensed some of that stuff

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:24.000
out because they have arcade games now and

01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:26.000
all sorts of crap. And the kids want to drop

01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:28.000
a dollar into the play Flappy Bird. I'm like are you

01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:30.000
fucking nuts. But maybe you know I

01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:32.000
can I can also understand that maybe he's just the fame

01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:34.000
and the attention and the

01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:36.000
strange phone calls and the people wanting to do

01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:38.000
business with you. Like maybe he was just overwhelmed.

01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:40.000
Yeah play Crossy Road. I got paid a dollar each

01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:42.000
game to play Crossy Road. I'm like you can

01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:44.000
play that for free. Why would you pay money.

01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:46.000
Pay a dollar to play DDR.

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:48.000
As YYR says in chat.

01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:50.000
Daddy I can win tickets.

01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:52.000
Barely any.

01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:54.000
And I try to tell them I'm like

01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:56.000
kid you're not winning enough.

01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:58.000
Make it worth my while. They're like well I want to

01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:00.000
play this game. Like OK well you just died

01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:02.000
and it cost a dollar and you won three tickets.

01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:04.000
Or you could play this game right here

01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:06.000
and win like 40 tickets

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:08.000
every time. 3 or 40.

01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:10.000
And then eventually they understand.

01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:14.000
And they would pay for that $15

01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:16.000
ring pop that they want.

01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:18.000
In chat says didn't he say that he feared

01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:20.000
he would get in trouble because of the popularity of

01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:22.000
the game because the country he lives in.

01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:24.000
Yeah I think that was part of it. So I'm not trying to

01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:26.000
dismiss his

01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:28.000
you know cautions about why he stopped making

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:30.000
the game. But it is one of those things that really just kind of

01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:32.000
like you know you do take a step back and go wow

01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:34.000
like somebody walking away from something

01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:36.000
that could have been even bigger and made

01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:38.000
even more money. It's like you just don't

01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:40.000
hear about that in our industry. It's like the one

01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:42.000
time that ever happened for whatever the reason is.

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:44.000
So anyway

01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:46.000
let's move on and

01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:48.000
talk about a few more stories.

01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:50.000
So I believe I'm next with a

01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:52.000
follow up on the Pokemon

01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:54.000
Dex controversy.

01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:56.000
So we got into that on a

01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:58.000
previous episode where you know the got to catch

01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:00.000
some of them. Not all the Pokemon

01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:02.000
are going to be coming over to Sword and Shield

01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:04.000
and some of the

01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:06.000
protests if you will the virtual

01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:08.000
Twitter things and things like that have

01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:10.000
not really died down and

01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:12.000
this week Game Freak

01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:14.000
responded

01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:16.000
with a producer letter and

01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:18.000
the producer letter

01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:20.000
you kind of it was kind of a way

01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:22.000
of saying I don't know it was a way of saying like

01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:24.000
we're hearing what you're saying but

01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:26.000
they didn't they didn't say they were not doing anything

01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:28.000
about it. Yeah I don't know if I would say they doubled

01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:30.000
down either. What they basically

01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:32.000
said was that and let

01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:34.000
me read some of the kind of well actually

01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:36.000
let me go to the full letter here maybe I can

01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:38.000
read some of the longer

01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:40.000
passages from it. But

01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:42.000
so yeah

01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:44.000
I'll just read the whole thing it's not that long.

01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:46.000
So the letter stated June 28th and it says

01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:48.000
thank you to all our fans for caring so deeply about

01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:50.000
Pokemon. Recently I shared the news

01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:52.000
that some Pokemon cannot be transferred to Pokemon

01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:54.000
Sword and Pokemon Shield. I've read

01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:56.000
all your comments and appreciate your love and

01:40:56.000 --> 01:40:58.000
passion for Pokemon. Just like

01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:00.000
all of you we are passionate

01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:02.000
about Pokemon and each and every one of them is very

01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:04.000
important to us. After so many years

01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:06.000
of developing the Pokemon video games

01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:08.000
this is a very difficult decision for me.

01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:10.000
I'd like to make one thing clear. Even

01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:12.000
if a specific Pokemon is not available

01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:14.000
in Pokemon Sword and Shield this does not

01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:16.000
mean that it will not appear in future

01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:18.000
games. The world of Pokemon continues

01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:20.000
to evolve. The Galar region

01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:22.000
offers new Pokemon to encounter trainers to battle

01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:24.000
and adventures to embark on. We are pouring

01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:26.000
our hearts into these games and we hope you will look forward

01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:28.000
to joining us in this new journey. So essentially

01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:30.000
he's saying if you

01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:32.000
are pissed that your Pokemon

01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:34.000
is not in this game that doesn't mean we're deleting

01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:36.000
them forever or that they're going to

01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:38.000
not come back in another Pokemon game

01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:40.000
because we all know this franchise is not

01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:42.000
going to go away anytime soon.

01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:44.000
But I don't know. I think there's a lot of people

01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:46.000
that are still just

01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:48.000
irritated. I don't know how else

01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:50.000
to put it. Let me go to chat.

01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:52.000
See what some folks are saying there. I know we've got some Pokefans

01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:54.000
in chat that probably have their own thing to say there.

01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:56.000
S2100Matt says

01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:58.000
we hear you but relax.

01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:00.000
It's not like we're going to stop making Pokemon games

01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:02.000
where you can still use those.

01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:04.000
Act Def says I said it before and I'll say

01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:06.000
it again. Yeah it sucks that not all

01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:08.000
the Pokemon won't appear in the newest games.

01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:10.000
But holy fuck are people over

01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:12.000
reacting to this.

01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:14.000
Well you know internet gonna internet.

01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:16.000
And I think there are some

01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:18.000
people overreacting. In fact I would even say there's a lot

01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:20.000
of people overreacting. But

01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:22.000
you know especially when you hear stories about the whole

01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:24.000
like they built up their collection from

01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:26.000
childhood. They had

01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:28.000
trades from friends they haven't seen.

01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:30.000
And like how important the

01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:32.000
collection is to some people.

01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:34.000
I get why people are left with a

01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:36.000
profound sense of

01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:38.000
sadness and disappointment.

01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:40.000
That part I get.

01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:42.000
The Twitter campaigns and that stuff

01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:44.000
and change.org and stuff

01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:46.000
I just you know but

01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:48.000
at the same time if people weren't doing

01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:50.000
that would it have prompted this letter.

01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:52.000
Is now the Pokemon

01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:54.000
company maybe thinking about this for the next

01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:56.000
thing they do. So while

01:42:56.000 --> 01:42:58.000
I don't I mean they're not going to fix it for Sword and

01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:00.000
Shield. We all knew they could. How could they

01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:02.000
possibly. The game's got to be wrapping up

01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:04.000
development. It's got to go gold by

01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:06.000
probably the end of summer early early early

01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:08.000
fall so it can get out in time.

01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:10.000
But you know maybe again if they decide

01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:12.000
to do a Pokemon gun

01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:14.000
I keep joking about that. What would it be. Maybe

01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:16.000
Pokemon arrow. I don't know.

01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:18.000
If a third thing in

01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:20.000
Pokemon Knight with a K. I don't know.

01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:22.000
So if they end up doing a third

01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:24.000
Pokemon in the series perhaps

01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:26.000
that will be the one that has all the Pokemon in it.

01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:28.000
But now I kind of feel

01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:30.000
like through this letter at least maybe like

01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:32.000
they're saying OK we

01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:34.000
heard you. They're not going to come out and say

01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:36.000
we made a mistake. Please. They're

01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:38.000
going to say I think they're going to say

01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:40.000
the next time we do this

01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:42.000
we're going to not

01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:44.000
do the same thing. At least

01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:46.000
I kind of hope as

01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:48.000
a Pokemon fan myself. That's what I'm hearing.

01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:50.000
So while they are also

01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:52.000
brings up it's hard enough to balance a game with matchups

01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:54.000
for over 500 characters. They probably got

01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:56.000
tired of having to balance so many

01:43:56.000 --> 01:43:58.000
character matchups. So

01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:00.000
and then a lot of just

01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:02.000
comments in our chat.

01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:04.000
DJ Rama S says Pokemon Belt

01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:06.000
Sia Tabiri. Pokemon

01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:08.000
Trebuchet.

01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:10.000
Metal Mayhem. Pokemon Tactical Nuke.

01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:12.000
Dark Tetsuya. Pokemon Helmet.

01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:14.000
All right guys calm down.

01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:16.000
So anyway we'll see what develops.

01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:18.000
I think in the

01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:20.000
long term I think people

01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:22.000
were kind of heard but gamers

01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:24.000
would rather hear now. They want

01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:26.000
to hear like oh there's going to be a patch that will

01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:28.000
fix all this. I just

01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:30.000
I don't think that's going to happen.

01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:32.000
If it does long term damage to the

01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:34.000
franchise or not that's what we'll see.

01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:36.000
That's going to be the real question

01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:38.000
and that's what I'm really dying

01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:40.000
to know the answer to. How

01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:42.000
is this going to impact sales at the end of the day?

01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:44.000
Because I bet there's a lot of

01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:46.000
people that are still going to buy the game because it's Pokemon even though

01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:48.000
they're pissed off. Yeah. I haven't really

01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:50.000
picked up a mainline Pokemon game

01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:52.000
like that. I've only done like

01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:54.000
you know let's go.

01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:56.000
I'll probably pick it up

01:44:56.000 --> 01:44:58.000
just because a new Pokemon

01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:00.000
Switch game like hell yeah I want to check it out.

01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:02.000
Like a new mainline game that's on a TV

01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:04.000
and portable console like for that alone

01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:06.000
I'm getting excited and some of the things they're doing.

01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:08.000
Doesn't mean I think they made the right decision

01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:10.000
but you know

01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:12.000
I still kind of want to check out what's there.

01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:14.000
So we'll see. Anyway.

01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:16.000
SSG 100

01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:18.000
Matt with a throwback here.

01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:20.000
Okay like two of you are going to get this joke.

01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:22.000
Pokemon peppermint time and mint.

01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:26.000
There's a great old joke in there.

01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:28.000
I'll leave it at that. Alright anyway.

01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:30.000
Moving on.

01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:32.000
Loki what do you have for us? Alright

01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:34.000
so this is kind of cool. So whereas

01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:36.000
we may have all these different

01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:40.000
platforms out there where we can purchase

01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:42.000
our games and kind of separating our libraries

01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:44.000
around. Good old games

01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:46.000
is trying to actually unite

01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:48.000
all of that together with GOG

01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:50.000
Galaxy 2.0.

01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:52.000
So GOG Galaxy 2.0 is in closed

01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:54.000
beta.

01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:56.000
But apparently their version of their client

01:45:56.000 --> 01:45:58.000
allows you to

01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:00.000
integrate

01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:02.000
other communities together.

01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:04.000
So for example right now

01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:06.000
GOG and Xbox Live are

01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:08.000
integrated but they're saying that Battle.net

01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:10.000
Epic, Origin, Playstation

01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:12.000
Network, Steam and Uplay

01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:14.000
are going to be available as

01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:16.000
community created

01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:18.000
integrations. And they said

01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:20.000
however these integrations

01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:22.000
function similarly

01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:24.000
allowing you to import games

01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:26.000
and depending on the platform

01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:28.000
achievements and other stuff.

01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:30.000
So they'll be able to have all of your

01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:32.000
game libraries together

01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:34.000
in one thing. I don't know

01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:36.000
if that means also being able to launch games

01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:38.000
from other platforms. Hopefully.

01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:40.000
So

01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:42.000
that would be cool if it was all in one place.

01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:44.000
I'm curious

01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:46.000
to check this out. It's in beta right now.

01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:50.000
Yo dog we heard you like launchers.

01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:52.000
So cross platform

01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:54.000
chat

01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:56.000
and one friends list.

01:46:56.000 --> 01:46:58.000
It's an interesting

01:46:58.000 --> 01:47:00.000
way for GOG to

01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:02.000
differentiate themselves

01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:04.000
from the competition by

01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:06.000
trying to be the good guy

01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:08.000
if you will. It's kind of

01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:10.000
interesting. The good old guy.

01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:12.000
That's what

01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:14.000
they're trying to do with this. It's your buddy.

01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:16.000
It's your buddy. Hey it's me

01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:18.000
it's GOG. You know how like your

01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:20.000
epic store and your steam and

01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:22.000
your battle net and Uplay

01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:24.000
and all that shit can't all get along.

01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:26.000
Well I'm here to help you get your shit sorted out.

01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:28.000
So I don't know. It sounds also

01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:30.000
to me very similar to like is it Apple

01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:32.000
TV. Oh no Playstation has

01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:34.000
this. Where if you go into like the

01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:36.000
TV movie thing on Playstation you

01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:38.000
can see like what movies are on what

01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:40.000
service. You know what I mean.

01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:42.000
That's kind of an interesting sort of

01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:44.000
approach to it.

01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:46.000
So and to be to be

01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:48.000
fair I haven't really used the GOG launcher

01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:50.000
in a while but this is something where

01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:52.000
I might go oh I'd be kind of curious to

01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:54.000
check this out. We'll see. So

01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:56.000
SSG100

01:47:56.000 --> 01:47:58.000
Matt points out yeah GOG needs

01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:00.000
to work on being the good guy. Yeah

01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:02.000
because we know they've had some choice things

01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:04.000
with their social media. So yeah

01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:06.000
maybe this is a chance for them

01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:08.000
to rehab their image a little.

01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:10.000
Questbuster in chat says Microsoft's

01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:12.000
officially on board already. Well that's

01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:14.000
good news. That's always good when like the

01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:16.000
companies are like yeah we support this. And I'm

01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:18.000
sure from Microsoft's perspective they're like

01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:20.000
yeah another place for people to sign up for

01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:22.000
Game Pass. Hell yeah.

01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:24.000
So why not.

01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:26.000
I'm into it. I think it's a

01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:28.000
clever idea. So we'll see what happens. I mean yeah I do

01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:30.000
I have that Epic launcher.

01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:32.000
I have Steam. I have

01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:34.000
Battle.net that all are on my

01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:36.000
computer and I use pretty regularly.

01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:38.000
So I'm into the

01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:40.000
idea of something to bring them all together.

01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:42.000
It would be nice to be able to do that.

01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:44.000
Yeah. I'd like that with my VR library

01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:46.000
too. It would be nice.

01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:48.000
Darticuia does want to point out they've addressed the social

01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:50.000
media stuff that guy's gone as far as I know.

01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:52.000
OK. All right.

01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:54.000
Anyway let's

01:48:54.000 --> 01:48:56.000
move on and talk about

01:48:56.000 --> 01:48:58.000
Google Stadia. You know

01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:00.000
because Google Stadia are going to be

01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:02.000
games that essentially exist in the clouds.

01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:04.000
You're not going to be picking them up physically at all.

01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:06.000
Some people were wondering well will that

01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:08.000
be kind of reflected in the price. And the answer

01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:10.000
is no.

01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:12.000
So Google has clarified that

01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:14.000
games that are sold on Stadia will

01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:16.000
probably not be cheaper than they are

01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:18.000
on PlayStation 4 or Xbox

01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:20.000
One.

01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:22.000
So if you choose to buy games

01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:24.000
on Stadia you're probably going to be

01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:26.000
paying the 60 bucks or a comparable

01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:28.000
price to what you would pay on consoles. You know some games

01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:30.000
are 20 or 30 bucks just depending on what the game is.

01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:32.000
Phil Harrison in an interview

01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:34.000
with Eurogamer said quote

01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:36.000
I don't know why it would be cheaper.

01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:38.000
In the interview Harrison

01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:40.000
talks about that you have access

01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:42.000
to your purchase games on any screen that

01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:44.000
you own and therefore you have

01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:46.000
kind of maximum fidelity with that.

01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:48.000
So it's like you don't just have this one system that your

01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:50.000
game works on. You can use this game

01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:52.000
that you bought on your tablet on your phone

01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:54.000
on your PC right. So that's

01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:56.000
kind of the angle he's trying to sell it with which

01:49:56.000 --> 01:49:58.000
OK sure that's what Stadia is going to do.

01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:00.000
But yeah

01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:02.000
for that reason they do not see the prices

01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:04.000
on Stadia being cheaper.

01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:06.000
Also saying

01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:08.000
the publisher or the developer is in as

01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:10.000
much control of the prices as we are

01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:12.000
so it's a bit difficult for me to say what the prices

01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:14.000
will be right now. But we're obviously

01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:16.000
going to be very aware of prevailing

01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:18.000
prices in the marketplace.

01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:20.000
So as a reminder Google Stadia Pro

01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:22.000
launches on November

01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:24.000
19th and that's the one you have to pay a little

01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:26.000
money for the free version not

01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:28.000
anticipated until next

01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:30.000
year. So yeah

01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:32.000
there's a lot of comments in our chat

01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:34.000
not so nice about this

01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:36.000
Dejirama S says Google Stadia whack

01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:38.000
Cajudo says rent games

01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:40.000
for full price. Dr. Suya says

01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:42.000
yeah the more I hear about Stadia the more I'm thinking

01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:44.000
I'll just stick with my PC.

01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:46.000
Orange Right says pay for the privilege of remotely

01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:48.000
playing it. So

01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:50.000
I don't know. I hope Stadia is kind of

01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:52.000
listening to some of the feedback they're getting out there and plans

01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:54.000
to address it. But this could be a little bit like

01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:56.000
this could be dicey for them.

01:50:56.000 --> 01:50:58.000
I don't know.

01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:00.000
Well they also made the comment too how they

01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:02.000
were talking about the

01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:04.000
bandwidth caps. So people had

01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:06.000
concerns about bandwidth caps and

01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:08.000
that's not going to be something that's going to

01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:10.000
work well with these games and

01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:12.000
their response was what are you talking

01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:14.000
about. This is the cable industry

01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:16.000
we're talking about. They'll adapt. They'll

01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:18.000
loosen up bandwidth caps if

01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:20.000
people want Stadia

01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:22.000
and I'm like are you fucking stupid

01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:24.000
do you exist in this reality. Well

01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:26.000
I kind of I don't want to

01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:28.000
say I agree 100 percent. I agree

01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:30.000
with the direction

01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:32.000
but that like the market

01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:34.000
will hoot and holler

01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:36.000
and force cable companies to upgrade

01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:38.000
as the demand for more stuff comes in.

01:51:38.000 --> 01:51:40.000
But hold on let me finish. It's not

01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:42.000
going to happen next year. That's my point.

01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:44.000
Yeah. So the thing is is that

01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:46.000
Google needs to be prepared

01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:48.000
and I think for Stadia

01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:50.000
to succeed if they want Stadia to succeed

01:51:50.000 --> 01:51:52.000
Google needs to really be prepared

01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:54.000
to really hang on to this

01:51:54.000 --> 01:51:56.000
for five

01:51:56.000 --> 01:51:58.000
ten years.

01:51:58.000 --> 01:52:00.000
I'm serious like

01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:02.000
because Google Stadia I don't see catching

01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:04.000
fire next year. But if Google

01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:06.000
is willing to stand by Stadia

01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:08.000
for five years ten years

01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:10.000
play the long game with this

01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:12.000
they might find success with it. They just

01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:14.000
well might because that will give enough time

01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:16.000
for the cable industry to catch up

01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:18.000
because that's when the 4K

01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:20.000
Netflix that's when that's going to get

01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:22.000
bigger and more and more people are streaming

01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:24.000
and that's really what's going to

01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:26.000
force the cable industry to look into upgrading

01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:28.000
and so forth.

01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:30.000
But if Google is going to just walk away

01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:32.000
from it if it flops in a year

01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:34.000
like Buzz

01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:36.000
or Google Plus or something like that

01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:38.000
then that's concerning. So what

01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:40.000
I would really like to hear

01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:42.000
is Google say we are committed

01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:44.000
to this for ten

01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:46.000
years. And I know

01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:48.000
that's a weird thing to ask a company to say

01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:50.000
but when you're Google I don't know if that is

01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:52.000
too crazy to ask. Especially with their track

01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:54.000
record. Yeah. Yeah. And folks in

01:52:54.000 --> 01:52:56.000
chat some folks kind of agreeing with me here

01:52:56.000 --> 01:52:58.000
saying Google will have to play

01:52:58.000 --> 01:53:00.000
the long game which they don't always do well

01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:02.000
and active says spoilers they won't.

01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:04.000
So yeah not people not

01:53:04.000 --> 01:53:06.000
feeling too big on that especially

01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:08.000
after the news about Hangouts

01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:10.000
last last week or two weeks ago

01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:12.000
that Google Hangouts is sunsetting. That's

01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:14.000
that's a big fucking deal especially for

01:53:14.000 --> 01:53:16.000
podcasters. Yeah. So

01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:18.000
I would

01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:20.000
recommend if you are somebody that's in the Hangouts

01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:22.000
there are alternatives out there. I mean I guess

01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:24.000
Skype is something that's available and I'm sure

01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:26.000
Microsoft would love to eat this up. So hopefully

01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:28.000
you know they're they're looking into

01:53:28.000 --> 01:53:30.000
things. Zoom meetings

01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:32.000
I know is a way a lot of people do like video and

01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:34.000
talk to each other. But I think you have to pay for

01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:36.000
advance meetings on that.

01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:38.000
So there are alternatives out there. So if

01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:40.000
you are somebody that's relied on Google Hangouts

01:53:40.000 --> 01:53:42.000
start start exploring what some of your backups

01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:44.000
are. So anyway

01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:46.000
interesting while I are in

01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:48.000
chat says Microsoft is actually

01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:50.000
removing the e-book store

01:53:50.000 --> 01:53:52.000
and the e-book reading feature from

01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:54.000
Microsoft Edge. And in exchange

01:53:54.000 --> 01:53:56.000
they're refunding the full purchase

01:53:56.000 --> 01:53:58.000
prices of all of the books you bought

01:53:58.000 --> 01:54:00.000
to your Microsoft account. Would Google

01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:02.000
do this.

01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:04.000
So no the answer is

01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:06.000
clearly no. So now what happens

01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:08.000
if Stadia goes under in a year you're going to get

01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:10.000
refunded for your games.

01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:12.000
Anyway that's that's the risk

01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:14.000
of buying digitally. Yeah

01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:16.000
and I just I just don't know if

01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:18.000
enough people are ready for it. I don't

01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:20.000
know I don't want to keep being negative on Stadia

01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:22.000
but it's just I just

01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:24.000
I think it's too right. It's too

01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:26.000
early. But maybe that's why pros coming out

01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:28.000
first let the people who really really want it

01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:30.000
and then let's see what exclusive

01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:32.000
games that they have that are must have

01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:34.000
you must that or whatever

01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:36.000
that too. All right. Moving on a few more

01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:38.000
stories that we're going to open up discord

01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:40.000
if you want to give us a call

01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:42.000
on our discord server at vognetwork.com

01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:44.000
slash discord you can do that. Just

01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:46.000
make your way to the green room on our

01:54:46.000 --> 01:54:48.000
discord server and a little blurb

01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:50.000
about what you'd like to talk about in our orange

01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:52.000
lounge radio channel will help you a

01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:54.000
lot. Again you're going to go to

01:54:54.000 --> 01:54:56.000
vognetwork.com

01:54:56.000 --> 01:54:58.000
vognetwork.com slash discord. If you're

01:54:58.000 --> 01:55:00.000
feeling too shy and don't want to call in

01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:02.000
you can always ask stuff in our chat room as well

01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:04.000
and I will try my best to get to it.

01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:06.000
If it scrolls off screen

01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:08.000
make sure I'm able

01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:10.000
to get to that later. Remind me.

01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:12.000
But a few stories first before we get to that.

01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:14.000
So I've been keeping my eye

01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:16.000
on the LEGO Overwatch

01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:18.000
sets. I haven't purchased any

01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:20.000
I thought about it

01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:22.000
but you know they're expensive

01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:24.000
and it's hard to justify

01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:26.000
buying sets but I don't know

01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:28.000
these new ones are pretty cool so they've got

01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:30.000
two new sets that are coming out in October

01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:32.000
so one of them is going to be

01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:34.000
for Hammond in

01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:36.000
Wrecking Ball. Basically

01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:38.000
that looks fucking awesome.

01:55:38.000 --> 01:55:40.000
That one's only twenty bucks.

01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:42.000
I probably will pick that one up for

01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:44.000
twenty dollars. That seems really worth it for that.

01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:46.000
The other set that's coming out though

01:55:46.000 --> 01:55:48.000
is fifty dollars

01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:50.000
and it is both

01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:52.000
Junkrat and

01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:54.000
Roadhog

01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:56.000
and they have this giant

01:55:56.000 --> 01:55:58.000
motorcycle thing.

01:55:58.000 --> 01:56:00.000
That looks alright.

01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:02.000
I'm surprised though that that's so much more

01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:04.000
expensive just for

01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:06.000
what that is. Because of all the parts maybe

01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:08.000
that make up that big Katamari looking thing.

01:56:08.000 --> 01:56:10.000
It's three hundred and eighty parts

01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:12.000
versus the

01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:14.000
Wrecking Ball one which is

01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:16.000
two hundred and twenty seven. Those are relatively small sets

01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:18.000
but like three hundred and eighty for

01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:20.000
fifty dollars

01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:22.000
is so expensive. That Wrecking Ball one

01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:24.000
is super fucking cute though. It is. I will have

01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:26.000
to probably pick that up. That's like the perfect

01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:28.000
like little like desk

01:56:28.000 --> 01:56:30.000
thing. That's where I put them. Yeah.

01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:32.000
The place I used to

01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:34.000
get some of my

01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:36.000
knock off sets. They

01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:38.000
have these custom

01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:40.000
brick heads of all the

01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:42.000
Overwatch characters. And so

01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:44.000
I'm thinking about getting those instead of the

01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:46.000
Overwatch sets but

01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:48.000
I do want that Wrecking Ball set

01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:50.000
that looks pretty awesome. Yeah.

01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:52.000
Maybe not. Maybe the Roadhog one but

01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:54.000
definitely the Wrecking Ball one.

01:56:54.000 --> 01:56:56.000
Yeah.

01:56:56.000 --> 01:56:58.000
It took me four hours to build

01:56:58.000 --> 01:57:00.000
Red Heart and Diva together. So yeah it's a good

01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:02.000
it's a good project. Right.

01:57:02.000 --> 01:57:04.000
Yeah. That one was also another

01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:06.000
I almost got that one too. That was the one I was

01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:08.000
kind of interested in but

01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:10.000
we'll see.

01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:12.000
Alright. Well moving on

01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:14.000
for our last story tonight which you know

01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:16.000
I know is a big part of many of your weeks

01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:18.000
because a lot of Twitch watchers

01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:20.000
and a lot of like gamers out there love to watch

01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:22.000
some summer games done quick.

01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:24.000
And of course the whole thing I mean it is about

01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:26.000
speed running games but it is done for

01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:28.000
charity. And it should be

01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:30.000
pointed out and this is really awesome is

01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:32.000
that summer games done quick

01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:34.000
shattered fundraising this year.

01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:36.000
They for the first time passed

01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:38.000
the three million dollar mark.

01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:40.000
And the charity that

01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:42.000
they raised money for this year was Doctors

01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:44.000
Without Borders. That is more

01:57:44.000 --> 01:57:46.000
than 900,000 in the

01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:48.000
previous year. So that's amazing.

01:57:48.000 --> 01:57:50.000
That's amazing. If you were actually

01:57:50.000 --> 01:57:52.000
there in Minneapolis Minnesota about

01:57:52.000 --> 01:57:54.000
2,600 people were there in person

01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:56.000
and they say the peak of the Twitch streams

01:57:56.000 --> 01:57:58.000
was 156,000

01:57:58.000 --> 01:58:00.000
viewers. So that's

01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:02.000
that's great. Congratulations

01:58:02.000 --> 01:58:04.000
to everybody involved with the

01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:06.000
games done quick. If you want to watch

01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:08.000
archives is available on the YouTube of course

01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:10.000
and the final

01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:12.000
final I'm using my quoting numbers as of

01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:14.000
the time of this report was three

01:58:14.000 --> 01:58:16.000
three million five thousand

01:58:16.000 --> 01:58:18.000
two hundred twenty eight dollars. But I believe the donations

01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:20.000
still kind of you can still donate for a little

01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:22.000
while afterwards. I mean hello it's charity

01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:24.000
fundraising. They're going to let you do that for a good long time.

01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:26.000
Anyway there will be

01:58:26.000 --> 01:58:28.000
there will be a games done quick

01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:30.000
express in September

01:58:30.000 --> 01:58:32.000
at Twitch Con. The next

01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:34.000
big show though is going to be Awesome

01:58:34.000 --> 01:58:36.000
Done Quick 2020 in January

01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:38.000
and that is going to be the 10 year

01:58:38.000 --> 01:58:40.000
anniversary of

01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:42.000
the show.

01:58:42.000 --> 01:58:44.000
That's very exciting. I really like watching

01:58:44.000 --> 01:58:46.000
these each year and I love catching up on

01:58:46.000 --> 01:58:48.000
everything on YouTube.

01:58:48.000 --> 01:58:50.000
Just because I'm not able to obviously

01:58:50.000 --> 01:58:52.000
in 24 hours a day

01:58:52.000 --> 01:58:54.000
to catch all these things.

01:58:54.000 --> 01:58:56.000
I watched was it the Zelda randomizer

01:58:56.000 --> 01:58:58.000
earlier this week. I was

01:58:58.000 --> 01:59:00.000
watching the Taskbot stuff earlier

01:59:00.000 --> 01:59:02.000
today the Mario Kart Wii.

01:59:02.000 --> 01:59:04.000
I watched parts the last

01:59:04.000 --> 01:59:06.000
but I didn't have enough time to get through like all of that

01:59:06.000 --> 01:59:08.000
and

01:59:08.000 --> 01:59:10.000
just yeah a lot of

01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:12.000
a lot of that stuff is just really interesting to watch

01:59:12.000 --> 01:59:14.000
the runs of those and so

01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:16.000
I wish they would do it more often than twice a year

01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:18.000
but I understand organizing. It makes it a little

01:59:18.000 --> 01:59:20.000
more special when they do it twice a year.

01:59:20.000 --> 01:59:22.000
And you know if you want to see speed runs people are

01:59:22.000 --> 01:59:24.000
speed running stuff on Twitch all of the time.

01:59:24.000 --> 01:59:26.000
And AG

01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:28.000
I want to say Games Done Quick does other things

01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:30.000
throughout the year. They have

01:59:30.000 --> 01:59:32.000
mini races and stuff like that

01:59:32.000 --> 01:59:34.000
that they'll do on those channels.

01:59:34.000 --> 01:59:36.000
So there's stuff out there

01:59:36.000 --> 01:59:38.000
that kind of

01:59:38.000 --> 01:59:40.000
in between all of that but

01:59:40.000 --> 01:59:42.000
I do like those events and

01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:44.000
it is sad that it's only twice a year

01:59:44.000 --> 01:59:46.000
but I understand why.

01:59:46.000 --> 01:59:48.000
At least they're doing these mini things too

01:59:48.000 --> 01:59:50.000
between TwitchCon and all that stuff as well.

01:59:50.000 --> 01:59:52.000
Anyway we are going

01:59:52.000 --> 01:59:54.000
to go to our Discord

01:59:54.000 --> 01:59:56.000
server and start to take some calls

01:59:56.000 --> 01:59:58.000
in our listener roundtable and if you have questions in our chat

01:59:58.000 --> 02:00:00.000
room you can certainly do that as well over at

02:00:00.000 --> 02:00:02.000
twitch.tv slash vog network.

02:00:02.000 --> 02:00:04.000
I know we have somebody already on the line. I have a

02:00:04.000 --> 02:00:06.000
feeling this might tie into our last story so let's go to the

02:00:06.000 --> 02:00:08.000
phone. Hi you are on Orange Launch Radio

02:00:08.000 --> 02:00:10.000
who's this?

02:00:12.000 --> 02:00:14.000
Hello you are on Orange Launch Radio who's

02:00:14.000 --> 02:00:16.000
this? Uh oh I think

02:00:16.000 --> 02:00:18.000
did I drag and drop them into the wrong? Let's try that again.

02:00:18.000 --> 02:00:20.000
Hi you are on Orange Launch Radio who's this?

02:00:22.000 --> 02:00:24.000
If you can hear me you are currently

02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:26.000
muted. I see the mute icon.

02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:28.000
So you might want to unmute.

02:00:28.000 --> 02:00:30.000
Yay I figured it out.

02:00:30.000 --> 02:00:32.000
You got it. It is

02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:34.000
our voice over man Jason

02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:36.000
who is

02:00:36.000 --> 02:00:38.000
Well on most weeks anyways. Yeah not tonight.

02:00:38.000 --> 02:00:40.000
I had the good old generic intro because even I

02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:42.000
was so freaking busy. We've all had busy weeks.

02:00:42.000 --> 02:00:44.000
But how are you my friend?

02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:46.000
You were at you were one of those

02:00:46.000 --> 02:00:48.000
2,600 people at SGDQ right?

02:00:48.000 --> 02:00:50.000
I was one of those

02:00:50.000 --> 02:00:52.000
2,600 people at GDQ.

02:00:52.000 --> 02:00:54.000
I was one of those oh geez

02:00:54.000 --> 02:00:56.000
what was it 70 names in the credits

02:00:56.000 --> 02:00:58.000
at the very end of the show? Oh

02:00:58.000 --> 02:01:00.000
cool. I didn't I didn't realize they did

02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:02.000
they did the credits at the I wasn't able to watch

02:01:02.000 --> 02:01:04.000
the end of it so just because

02:01:04.000 --> 02:01:06.000
because I've been LARPing I haven't been

02:01:06.000 --> 02:01:08.000
able to really watch any of the streams

02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:10.000
I'll have to go back and do it on YouTube so

02:01:10.000 --> 02:01:12.000
Yeah they if you

02:01:12.000 --> 02:01:14.000
I assume you can go back and I don't

02:01:14.000 --> 02:01:16.000
know if they'll put it on YouTube

02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:18.000
if they'll just kind of like attach it to the

02:01:18.000 --> 02:01:20.000
Kruger run but certainly if you go

02:01:20.000 --> 02:01:22.000
back and watch the past broadcast

02:01:22.000 --> 02:01:24.000
of the very end of the Twitch stream

02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:26.000
they had a little

02:01:26.000 --> 02:01:28.000
sizzle reel for the

02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:30.000
for the end of the show talking about

02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:32.000
what it is what they did and

02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:34.000
then they had a credit sequence of

02:01:34.000 --> 02:01:36.000
all of the staff and all of the volunteers

02:01:36.000 --> 02:01:38.000
for the occasion as well.

02:01:38.000 --> 02:01:40.000
Well so I'm dying to know

02:01:40.000 --> 02:01:42.000
how was your first experience

02:01:42.000 --> 02:01:44.000
there because you know it said

02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:46.000
156,000 were watching

02:01:46.000 --> 02:01:48.000
at the peak on Twitch but only

02:01:48.000 --> 02:01:50.000
2,600 are there

02:01:50.000 --> 02:01:52.000
in person obviously this is a big

02:01:52.000 --> 02:01:54.000
you know fundraiser across

02:01:54.000 --> 02:01:56.000
you know virtual channels and television

02:01:56.000 --> 02:01:58.000
stuff but I imagine the experience of being

02:01:58.000 --> 02:02:00.000
there is something very few

02:02:00.000 --> 02:02:02.000
of the viewers have experienced so I'm kind

02:02:02.000 --> 02:02:04.000
of curious what did you think seeing it from this

02:02:04.000 --> 02:02:06.000
side this time? Yeah

02:02:06.000 --> 02:02:08.000
and a lot of people

02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:10.000
sis as a recurring theme you

02:02:10.000 --> 02:02:12.000
go to any other prominent

02:02:12.000 --> 02:02:14.000
convention any anime convention

02:02:14.000 --> 02:02:16.000
any gaming convention

02:02:16.000 --> 02:02:18.000
on the tier of TwitchCon

02:02:18.000 --> 02:02:20.000
on the tier of even like

02:02:20.000 --> 02:02:22.000
the ComicCon series

02:02:22.000 --> 02:02:24.000
or the PopCultureCon series

02:02:24.000 --> 02:02:26.000
as Denver recently renamed to

02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:28.000
you go to any other convention that is

02:02:28.000 --> 02:02:30.000
intended to pull

02:02:30.000 --> 02:02:32.000
big crowds to pull big

02:02:32.000 --> 02:02:34.000
names to pull bigger crowds

02:02:34.000 --> 02:02:36.000
to pull bigger names

02:02:36.000 --> 02:02:38.000
and you have this critical mass

02:02:38.000 --> 02:02:40.000
of everything in fun culture

02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:42.000
where because this is a

02:02:42.000 --> 02:02:44.000
deliberately limited

02:02:44.000 --> 02:02:46.000
event in physical

02:02:46.000 --> 02:02:48.000
participation

02:02:48.000 --> 02:02:50.000
yeah it's at a very

02:02:50.000 --> 02:02:52.000
very reasonable number and then

02:02:52.000 --> 02:02:54.000
you take that 2,600

02:02:54.000 --> 02:02:56.000
you slice it up between people

02:02:56.000 --> 02:02:58.000
that aren't there for the whole week

02:02:58.000 --> 02:03:00.000
people that go there for friends

02:03:00.000 --> 02:03:02.000
the sheer number of like

02:03:02.000 --> 02:03:04.000
24 hour event people that are more night

02:03:04.000 --> 02:03:06.000
owls people that are more morning people that are

02:03:06.000 --> 02:03:08.000
more daytime and you have

02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:10.000
this really comfortable

02:03:10.000 --> 02:03:12.000
spread where

02:03:12.000 --> 02:03:14.000
even though it only takes place on the

02:03:14.000 --> 02:03:16.000
single floor of a hotel it

02:03:16.000 --> 02:03:18.000
still like

02:03:18.000 --> 02:03:20.000
flows smoothly enough

02:03:20.000 --> 02:03:22.000
because of the deliberate

02:03:22.000 --> 02:03:24.000
limiting

02:03:24.000 --> 02:03:26.000
and I should point out Jason

02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:28.000
is on the road right now so his

02:03:28.000 --> 02:03:30.000
audio may drop a little bit in and out

02:03:30.000 --> 02:03:32.000
as it's doing right now Jason sorry I

02:03:32.000 --> 02:03:34.000
don't know if the connection is stabilizing there can you hear us

02:03:34.000 --> 02:03:36.000
yeah I can hear you just fine

02:03:36.000 --> 02:03:38.000
you're just cutting in where are

02:03:38.000 --> 02:03:40.000
you right now on the road

02:03:40.000 --> 02:03:42.000
I am currently in Nebraska

02:03:42.000 --> 02:03:44.000
ok well

02:03:44.000 --> 02:03:46.000
the Nebraska internet is

02:03:46.000 --> 02:03:48.000
a little wonky but that's alright

02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:50.000
so yeah

02:03:50.000 --> 02:03:52.000
that's an interesting point is that that number is really

02:03:52.000 --> 02:03:54.000
kind of spread out because it's such a long

02:03:54.000 --> 02:03:56.000
convention and so forth by the

02:03:56.000 --> 02:03:58.000
way you're getting a lot of love in our chat room

02:03:58.000 --> 02:04:00.000
for folks saying Jason has the

02:04:00.000 --> 02:04:02.000
SJ100 Matt says Jason has the voice

02:04:02.000 --> 02:04:04.000
to be a donation announcer not

02:04:04.000 --> 02:04:06.000
sure why they didn't catch that

02:04:06.000 --> 02:04:08.000
and then let's see Questbuster

02:04:08.000 --> 02:04:10.000
says seriously he'd be great as an announcer

02:04:10.000 --> 02:04:12.000
hashtag future

02:04:12.000 --> 02:04:14.000
goals so

02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:16.000
it's a funny funny story like

02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:18.000
when you when you sign

02:04:18.000 --> 02:04:20.000
up to be a volunteer

02:04:20.000 --> 02:04:22.000
you what

02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:24.000
they what they actually did first time this year

02:04:24.000 --> 02:04:26.000
and specifically for SGDQ

02:04:26.000 --> 02:04:28.000
was people applying to

02:04:28.000 --> 02:04:30.000
be a host actually did a little

02:04:30.000 --> 02:04:32.000
audition they got

02:04:32.000 --> 02:04:34.000
Zenny I forgot

02:04:34.000 --> 02:04:36.000
his whole username but they got a

02:04:36.000 --> 02:04:38.000
Super Metroid runner to make a generic

02:04:38.000 --> 02:04:40.000
five minute video and then

02:04:40.000 --> 02:04:42.000
they gave a bunch of kind of

02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:44.000
sample sample

02:04:44.000 --> 02:04:46.000
donations to see if you can spot

02:04:46.000 --> 02:04:48.000
to gauge

02:04:48.000 --> 02:04:50.000
your ability to read comfortably

02:04:50.000 --> 02:04:52.000
but also to make sure that you're not just

02:04:52.000 --> 02:04:54.000
going to blurt out there was actually one

02:04:54.000 --> 02:04:56.000
suggested donation comment

02:04:56.000 --> 02:04:58.000
that said

02:04:58.000 --> 02:05:00.000
acted like it was talking about a

02:05:00.000 --> 02:05:02.000
character in the metro universe but was

02:05:02.000 --> 02:05:04.000
actually making a racist reference

02:05:04.000 --> 02:05:06.000
so even though donation

02:05:06.000 --> 02:05:08.000
screening is a thing is another

02:05:08.000 --> 02:05:10.000
role they also want to make sure that

02:05:10.000 --> 02:05:12.000
hosts are reasonable with content

02:05:12.000 --> 02:05:14.000
and checking and

02:05:14.000 --> 02:05:16.000
and apply you know that much

02:05:16.000 --> 02:05:18.000
to the universe and they're not just

02:05:18.000 --> 02:05:20.000
literally reading off a script because the

02:05:20.000 --> 02:05:22.000
point of the host is is to is to

02:05:22.000 --> 02:05:24.000
host is to is to be the voice

02:05:24.000 --> 02:05:26.000
I apply and

02:05:26.000 --> 02:05:28.000
to be a host I was just outside the

02:05:28.000 --> 02:05:30.000
bubble and I think one of the

02:05:30.000 --> 02:05:32.000
biggest reasons why I got a little bit of feedback

02:05:32.000 --> 02:05:34.000
that was a little weirdly mixed

02:05:34.000 --> 02:05:36.000
but one of the things that was a

02:05:36.000 --> 02:05:38.000
silly idea in

02:05:38.000 --> 02:05:40.000
in hindsight of my own decision was

02:05:40.000 --> 02:05:42.000
that I called it super

02:05:42.000 --> 02:05:44.000
games done quick which has not

02:05:44.000 --> 02:05:46.000
been the name for a good couple of years

02:05:46.000 --> 02:05:48.000
and I was kind of

02:05:48.000 --> 02:05:50.000
it was kind of a you know on the nose

02:05:50.000 --> 02:05:52.000
flashing my OG

02:05:52.000 --> 02:05:54.000
status or some crap like

02:05:54.000 --> 02:05:56.000
that despite the fact that this was the first time I

02:05:56.000 --> 02:05:58.000
attended but that was a

02:05:58.000 --> 02:06:00.000
detriment because I'm running the show

02:06:00.000 --> 02:06:02.000
and as the host you

02:06:02.000 --> 02:06:04.000
have to push the details

02:06:04.000 --> 02:06:06.000
admittedly when you're on the show you have a

02:06:06.000 --> 02:06:08.000
producer in your ear you're dealing with the crowd

02:06:08.000 --> 02:06:10.000
the hosts banter with

02:06:10.000 --> 02:06:12.000
the runner and those sorts of things like

02:06:12.000 --> 02:06:14.000
you're getting all this feedback but it's

02:06:14.000 --> 02:06:16.000
still important that you're in the

02:06:16.000 --> 02:06:18.000
culture to begin with

02:06:18.000 --> 02:06:20.000
I met

02:06:20.000 --> 02:06:22.000
a sporadic erratic

02:06:22.000 --> 02:06:24.000
that did the

02:06:24.000 --> 02:06:26.000
chrono trigger that was the host for that

02:06:26.000 --> 02:06:28.000
final run I met her at that orientation

02:06:28.000 --> 02:06:30.000
and then bantered with her

02:06:30.000 --> 02:06:32.000
throughout the week and then talked to her after

02:06:32.000 --> 02:06:34.000
after it was all said and done

02:06:34.000 --> 02:06:36.000
and she got that shift

02:06:36.000 --> 02:06:38.000
because she was very much

02:06:38.000 --> 02:06:40.000
in with those

02:06:40.000 --> 02:06:42.000
runners and considering

02:06:42.000 --> 02:06:44.000
that she sang Gato's

02:06:44.000 --> 02:06:46.000
song or Gonzalez's

02:06:46.000 --> 02:06:48.000
song as it was

02:06:48.000 --> 02:06:50.000
in Japanese like

02:06:50.000 --> 02:06:52.000
that's a distinct

02:06:52.000 --> 02:06:54.000
quality that just

02:06:54.000 --> 02:06:56.000
fucking shined for her that was

02:06:56.000 --> 02:06:58.000
truly incredible and you get

02:06:58.000 --> 02:07:00.000
that with like the

02:07:00.000 --> 02:07:02.000
I don't remember the host

02:07:02.000 --> 02:07:04.000
for the

02:07:04.000 --> 02:07:06.000
Super Metroid Zelda combo

02:07:06.000 --> 02:07:08.000
combo co-op but like

02:07:08.000 --> 02:07:10.000
that's the strength of

02:07:10.000 --> 02:07:12.000
submitting to be a host is not

02:07:12.000 --> 02:07:14.000
just your capability to do that production

02:07:14.000 --> 02:07:16.000
but also to

02:07:16.000 --> 02:07:18.000
had to be in a community

02:07:18.000 --> 02:07:20.000
and to be able to be

02:07:20.000 --> 02:07:22.000
part of the presentation be part

02:07:22.000 --> 02:07:24.000
of the show as it's being done

02:07:24.000 --> 02:07:26.000
where possible with the runner get

02:07:26.000 --> 02:07:28.000
accepted to the show and everything else like that so

02:07:28.000 --> 02:07:30.000
I did apply to be a host I did not get

02:07:30.000 --> 02:07:32.000
accepted as many people no doubt

02:07:32.000 --> 02:07:34.000
saw I got my

02:07:34.000 --> 02:07:36.000
second choice which was enforcement which was

02:07:36.000 --> 02:07:38.000
bag checking just

02:07:38.000 --> 02:07:40.000
waiting food from the floor I

02:07:40.000 --> 02:07:42.000
did a bunch of cleanup of the stream

02:07:42.000 --> 02:07:44.000
multiple times picking up latent cups

02:07:44.000 --> 02:07:46.000
and all that kind of all that kind of nonsense

02:07:46.000 --> 02:07:48.000
I

02:07:48.000 --> 02:07:50.000
got relatively easy shifts as well

02:07:50.000 --> 02:07:52.000
they were all 8 a.m. to noon

02:07:52.000 --> 02:07:54.000
based off the

02:07:54.000 --> 02:07:56.000
based off the discussion that was happening

02:07:56.000 --> 02:07:58.000
in the in the volunteers channel

02:07:58.000 --> 02:08:00.000
things were a little dicey

02:08:00.000 --> 02:08:02.000
earlier in the night because you get the

02:08:02.000 --> 02:08:04.000
2 a.m. 3 a.m. drunkie

02:08:04.000 --> 02:08:06.000
shenanigans and then just kind of

02:08:06.000 --> 02:08:08.000
the more critical mass

02:08:08.000 --> 02:08:10.000
in the afternoon hours and those

02:08:10.000 --> 02:08:12.000
sorts of things my job was

02:08:12.000 --> 02:08:14.000
relatively easy all things concerned

02:08:14.000 --> 02:08:16.000
but the entirety of being

02:08:16.000 --> 02:08:18.000
a volunteer with GDQ was a great

02:08:18.000 --> 02:08:20.000
experience not

02:08:20.000 --> 02:08:22.000
only not only because this

02:08:22.000 --> 02:08:24.000
was my first time attending

02:08:24.000 --> 02:08:26.000
and I also got to be part of the production

02:08:26.000 --> 02:08:28.000
but also just to be able to see

02:08:28.000 --> 02:08:30.000
what's happening on a technical level

02:08:30.000 --> 02:08:32.000
interact with the staff meet the staff

02:08:32.000 --> 02:08:34.000
everything that they put into it

02:08:34.000 --> 02:08:36.000
on a technical level both in

02:08:36.000 --> 02:08:38.000
discord generally where volunteers

02:08:38.000 --> 02:08:40.000
chat in slack specifically

02:08:40.000 --> 02:08:42.000
because that gives us enforcement

02:08:42.000 --> 02:08:44.000
a little bit more granular

02:08:44.000 --> 02:08:46.000
discussion to be able to shout out a staff

02:08:46.000 --> 02:08:48.000
member if we need additional

02:08:48.000 --> 02:08:50.000
intervention and those sorts of things

02:08:50.000 --> 02:08:52.000
and then

02:08:52.000 --> 02:08:54.000
everything that goes on on the stage

02:08:54.000 --> 02:08:56.000
being able to banter being able

02:08:56.000 --> 02:08:58.000
to meet and talk to the people on

02:08:58.000 --> 02:09:00.000
the other on the other occasions

02:09:00.000 --> 02:09:02.000
there there was some discussion

02:09:02.000 --> 02:09:04.000
about more

02:09:04.000 --> 02:09:06.000
significantly known personalities

02:09:06.000 --> 02:09:08.000
in other roles that enforcement

02:09:08.000 --> 02:09:10.000
kind of had to come in and

02:09:10.000 --> 02:09:12.000
come in

02:09:12.000 --> 02:09:14.000
serve their purpose serve their role to

02:09:14.000 --> 02:09:16.000
dissuade to dissuade

02:09:16.000 --> 02:09:18.000
the nonsense that does

02:09:18.000 --> 02:09:20.000
happen just not in large

02:09:20.000 --> 02:09:22.000
numbers again because of the limited

02:09:22.000 --> 02:09:24.000
nature of the events

02:09:24.000 --> 02:09:26.000
but it's like it's it is a

02:09:26.000 --> 02:09:28.000
I

02:09:28.000 --> 02:09:30.000
love the fact that

02:09:30.000 --> 02:09:32.000
it is infrequent

02:09:32.000 --> 02:09:34.000
as it is with the most

02:09:34.000 --> 02:09:36.000
notable events being

02:09:36.000 --> 02:09:38.000
AGDQ GDQ and GDQ express

02:09:38.000 --> 02:09:40.000
but

02:09:40.000 --> 02:09:42.000
also to their benefit they're also

02:09:42.000 --> 02:09:44.000
doing things like frame fatales

02:09:44.000 --> 02:09:46.000
that they did back in May

02:09:46.000 --> 02:09:48.000
hot fixes both interviews and

02:09:48.000 --> 02:09:50.000
runs and special sorts of things

02:09:50.000 --> 02:09:52.000
to kind of keep

02:09:52.000 --> 02:09:54.000
a modicum of

02:09:54.000 --> 02:09:56.000
interest in between these sorts of events

02:09:56.000 --> 02:09:58.000
but this is truly

02:09:58.000 --> 02:10:00.000
becoming

02:10:00.000 --> 02:10:02.000
they're they're stepping up content

02:10:02.000 --> 02:10:04.000
where possible and always

02:10:04.000 --> 02:10:06.000
continuing to be done

02:10:06.000 --> 02:10:08.000
for good causes which

02:10:08.000 --> 02:10:10.000
as long as that's the number one

02:10:10.000 --> 02:10:12.000
goal and drives

02:10:12.000 --> 02:10:14.000
their drives

02:10:14.000 --> 02:10:16.000
what they are capable of doing

02:10:16.000 --> 02:10:18.000
they're going to

02:10:18.000 --> 02:10:20.000
you know produce just enough content to

02:10:20.000 --> 02:10:22.000
be relevant and continue to do it for

02:10:22.000 --> 02:10:24.000
for spectacular reasons

02:10:24.000 --> 02:10:26.000
you know it's and the

02:10:26.000 --> 02:10:28.000
game's done quick brand is really kind of like

02:10:28.000 --> 02:10:30.000
set the bar in a lot of categories

02:10:30.000 --> 02:10:32.000
kind of like you know like like you know and continue

02:10:32.000 --> 02:10:34.000
to raise that bar in you know not just like

02:10:34.000 --> 02:10:36.000
what what is a good

02:10:36.000 --> 02:10:38.000
speed running stream kind of look like

02:10:38.000 --> 02:10:40.000
what does good commentating on a speed running

02:10:40.000 --> 02:10:42.000
stream look like but just the ends of how do

02:10:42.000 --> 02:10:44.000
you how do you run an effective charity stream

02:10:44.000 --> 02:10:46.000
I mean especially the amount

02:10:46.000 --> 02:10:48.000
that they they raised

02:10:48.000 --> 02:10:50.000
I mean it's just a huge testament

02:10:50.000 --> 02:10:52.000
to this formula that they've refined

02:10:52.000 --> 02:10:54.000
over there coming up on 10 year existence

02:10:54.000 --> 02:10:56.000
that I think just really speaks to

02:10:56.000 --> 02:10:58.000
you know the hard work that all these volunteers are putting in

02:10:58.000 --> 02:11:00.000
year round even if we're lamenting that

02:11:00.000 --> 02:11:02.000
you know it only happens twice a year it

02:11:02.000 --> 02:11:04.000
sounds like that you know production yeah they're working

02:11:04.000 --> 02:11:06.000
to year round to really make it a type

02:11:06.000 --> 02:11:08.000
of production some

02:11:08.000 --> 02:11:10.000
pick up comments in our chat here quest buster says

02:11:10.000 --> 02:11:12.000
Jason's leveled up his diplomacy skill

02:11:12.000 --> 02:11:14.000
at SGDQ and

02:11:14.000 --> 02:11:16.000
as soon as Matt says they also did a

02:11:16.000 --> 02:11:18.000
few pickup streams for to benefit

02:11:18.000 --> 02:11:20.000
disasters which is also great oh that's

02:11:20.000 --> 02:11:22.000
that's definitely true yeah that's

02:11:22.000 --> 02:11:24.000
right the the Hurricane Maria

02:11:24.000 --> 02:11:26.000
stuff it was that earlier

02:11:26.000 --> 02:11:28.000
jeez I don't even remember when that happened but yeah I

02:11:28.000 --> 02:11:30.000
completely forgot about the

02:11:30.000 --> 02:11:32.000
both the Houston flooding last

02:11:32.000 --> 02:11:34.000
year as well as Hurricane Mary

02:11:34.000 --> 02:11:36.000
and those sorts of disaster

02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:38.000
really yeah I had I completely

02:11:38.000 --> 02:11:40.000
forgotten about those without that being

02:11:40.000 --> 02:11:42.000
mentioned they're being brought up

02:11:42.000 --> 02:11:44.000
Jason let me ask you this since it was

02:11:44.000 --> 02:11:46.000
a year that really raised the bar in many

02:11:46.000 --> 02:11:48.000
ways what was the mood in the

02:11:48.000 --> 02:11:50.000
room like when y'all heard you

02:11:50.000 --> 02:11:52.000
hit that three million mark

02:11:52.000 --> 02:11:54.000
so truth be

02:11:54.000 --> 02:11:56.000
told I actually was not in the

02:11:56.000 --> 02:11:58.000
stream room for the finale something

02:11:58.000 --> 02:12:00.000
that was super fun was that they

02:12:00.000 --> 02:12:02.000
actually had GDQ broadcasting

02:12:02.000 --> 02:12:04.000
on one of the in hotel channels

02:12:04.000 --> 02:12:06.000
so as long as you were in the same

02:12:06.000 --> 02:12:08.000
DoubleTree hotel as the event you could

02:12:08.000 --> 02:12:10.000
just tune in and watch from the comfort of your room

02:12:10.000 --> 02:12:12.000
which I was doing because my

02:12:12.000 --> 02:12:14.000
sleep schedule was very upside down

02:12:14.000 --> 02:12:16.000
because waking up at

02:12:16.000 --> 02:12:18.000
7 a.m. for an 8 a.m.

02:12:18.000 --> 02:12:20.000
shift oh man I yeah

02:12:20.000 --> 02:12:22.000
I needless to say I was just up

02:12:22.000 --> 02:12:24.000
literally all night did the shift and then

02:12:24.000 --> 02:12:26.000
knocked out for the day so I got

02:12:26.000 --> 02:12:28.000
comfortable and I'm not I'm not I'm not

02:12:28.000 --> 02:12:30.000
truth be told I am not a huge

02:12:30.000 --> 02:12:32.000
fan of being in that

02:12:32.000 --> 02:12:34.000
type of a situation like with that

02:12:34.000 --> 02:12:36.000
the critical mass of people

02:12:36.000 --> 02:12:38.000
as much as it is it's still a room

02:12:38.000 --> 02:12:40.000
packed full standing room

02:12:40.000 --> 02:12:42.000
only of the of the streamer

02:12:42.000 --> 02:12:44.000
for the very thing so

02:12:44.000 --> 02:12:46.000
truth be told I only saw it

02:12:46.000 --> 02:12:48.000
like I did the rest of you however

02:12:48.000 --> 02:12:50.000
I did go downstairs

02:12:50.000 --> 02:12:52.000
immediately on the conclusion

02:12:52.000 --> 02:12:54.000
because that way I could I could seek out

02:12:54.000 --> 02:12:56.000
friends like I said I was talking to

02:12:56.000 --> 02:12:58.000
Miss sporadic immediately

02:12:58.000 --> 02:13:00.000
afterwards as well and I was talking to

02:13:00.000 --> 02:13:02.000
some of the some of the specific

02:13:02.000 --> 02:13:04.000
failures that were going on during her

02:13:04.000 --> 02:13:06.000
shift I don't know if anybody

02:13:06.000 --> 02:13:08.000
else noticed this but she accidentally

02:13:08.000 --> 02:13:10.000
left the mic on

02:13:10.000 --> 02:13:12.000
it was about an hour

02:13:12.000 --> 02:13:14.000
and a half before

02:13:14.000 --> 02:13:16.000
the finale but before the end of

02:13:16.000 --> 02:13:18.000
that run or something like that she

02:13:18.000 --> 02:13:20.000
inadvertently left the mic on and she

02:13:20.000 --> 02:13:22.000
was actually just talking to

02:13:22.000 --> 02:13:24.000
the hosting coordinator right over

02:13:24.000 --> 02:13:26.000
her shoulder that was like I don't think

02:13:26.000 --> 02:13:28.000
we're gonna it was it was either for a

02:13:28.000 --> 02:13:30.000
donation incentive or something like that but she was just kind of like

02:13:30.000 --> 02:13:32.000
I don't think we're gonna make this one

02:13:32.000 --> 02:13:34.000
and she

02:13:34.000 --> 02:13:36.000
said it so quick and then she realized

02:13:36.000 --> 02:13:38.000
that she heard it back to the headset and she immediately

02:13:38.000 --> 02:13:40.000
just I am so

02:13:40.000 --> 02:13:42.000
sorry about that and then

02:13:42.000 --> 02:13:44.000
and then killed her headset I

02:13:44.000 --> 02:13:46.000
killed the microphone

02:13:46.000 --> 02:13:48.000
so I got a little bit of

02:13:48.000 --> 02:13:50.000
chuckle out of that and then I ribbed her for it because we were

02:13:50.000 --> 02:13:52.000
like I said we were talking a little bit and just

02:13:52.000 --> 02:13:54.000
maybe it motivated

02:13:54.000 --> 02:13:56.000
the internet out of spite to make that goal

02:13:56.000 --> 02:13:58.000
happen

02:13:58.000 --> 02:14:00.000
she said exactly the same thing and like

02:14:00.000 --> 02:14:02.000
there's no there's no formula for this stuff she was

02:14:02.000 --> 02:14:04.000
a little bit for having

02:14:04.000 --> 02:14:06.000
to push so many

02:14:06.000 --> 02:14:08.000
incentives because there were like

02:14:08.000 --> 02:14:10.000
there were like 10 different incentives for Corona Trigger

02:14:10.000 --> 02:14:12.000
alone naming every single

02:14:12.000 --> 02:14:14.000
character plus a hundred percent

02:14:14.000 --> 02:14:16.000
plus the three million push

02:14:16.000 --> 02:14:18.000
just in general at the end

02:14:18.000 --> 02:14:20.000
plus

02:14:20.000 --> 02:14:22.000
Speccio

02:14:22.000 --> 02:14:24.000
Speccio in the new battles

02:14:24.000 --> 02:14:26.000
just like so many

02:14:26.000 --> 02:14:28.000
incentives at the very very end that were just

02:14:28.000 --> 02:14:30.000
absolutely ridiculous

02:14:30.000 --> 02:14:32.000
to ground

02:14:32.000 --> 02:14:34.000
all this money at the end but it was

02:14:34.000 --> 02:14:36.000
it was truly remarkable it was truly

02:14:36.000 --> 02:14:38.000
an event and they dropped in

02:14:38.000 --> 02:14:40.000
they dropped in sponsorship

02:14:40.000 --> 02:14:42.000
and Yeti and all that and all

02:14:42.000 --> 02:14:44.000
that money I think twitch stuff

02:14:44.000 --> 02:14:46.000
happens automatically

02:14:46.000 --> 02:14:48.000
maybe not maybe not ads but

02:14:48.000 --> 02:14:50.000
like they dropped in a good

02:14:50.000 --> 02:14:52.000
400,000 or something

02:14:52.000 --> 02:14:54.000
like that in the last 30

02:14:54.000 --> 02:14:56.000
45 minutes just kind of cut it off and did it

02:14:56.000 --> 02:14:58.000
and yeah to see the

02:14:58.000 --> 02:15:00.000
production as it was

02:15:00.000 --> 02:15:02.000
ongoing and be able to take that

02:15:02.000 --> 02:15:04.000
and apply it to things

02:15:04.000 --> 02:15:06.000
that I was just watching after the fact

02:15:06.000 --> 02:15:08.000
was a really really fun experience

02:15:08.000 --> 02:15:10.000
I'm so excited

02:15:10.000 --> 02:15:12.000
to have you in studio again at some point

02:15:12.000 --> 02:15:14.000
and hear even more from your experiences

02:15:14.000 --> 02:15:16.000
but I'm going to try to wrap up because

02:15:16.000 --> 02:15:18.000
I do want to make sure we squeeze in a few more calls here with

02:15:18.000 --> 02:15:20.000
our time but best of luck

02:15:20.000 --> 02:15:22.000
to you Jason if you decide to try for the announcer

02:15:22.000 --> 02:15:24.000
thing again I know it's something that Bobby Blockwell

02:15:24.000 --> 02:15:26.000
has talked about pursuing as well

02:15:26.000 --> 02:15:28.000
for me personally I don't know

02:15:28.000 --> 02:15:30.000
I can't fit in another show in my travel

02:15:30.000 --> 02:15:32.000
schedule but you know I support you both

02:15:32.000 --> 02:15:34.000
and I

02:15:34.000 --> 02:15:36.000
fingers and toes crossed

02:15:36.000 --> 02:15:38.000
yeah I don't remember if they

02:15:38.000 --> 02:15:40.000
take volunteers for GDQX but

02:15:40.000 --> 02:15:42.000
obviously I'm going to be keeping my ears open for that

02:15:42.000 --> 02:15:44.000
because I already have my TwitchCon ticket and

02:15:44.000 --> 02:15:46.000
I absolutely

02:15:46.000 --> 02:15:48.000
intend to do this again next year so thank

02:15:48.000 --> 02:15:50.000
thank all of you thank you specifically

02:15:50.000 --> 02:15:52.000
and yeah have a great night

02:15:52.000 --> 02:15:54.000
thanks Jason drive safe

02:15:54.000 --> 02:15:56.000
above everything else I know it's night

02:15:56.000 --> 02:15:58.000
time now we'll continue to do

02:15:58.000 --> 02:16:00.000
alright thank you appreciate it take

02:16:00.000 --> 02:16:02.000
care buddy

02:16:02.000 --> 02:16:04.000
alright always great to hear

02:16:04.000 --> 02:16:06.000
from Jason here on the show

02:16:06.000 --> 02:16:08.000
go ahead and go to another call

02:16:08.000 --> 02:16:10.000
hi you're on Orange Lounge Radio who's this

02:16:10.000 --> 02:16:12.000
hey what's up guys can you hear me it's Kaijuto

02:16:12.000 --> 02:16:14.000
we sure can hey Kaijuto what's on your mind tonight

02:16:14.000 --> 02:16:16.000
how much I just have two things I wanted to bring

02:16:16.000 --> 02:16:18.000
up real quickly

02:16:18.000 --> 02:16:20.000
first the Pokemon remember you guys are talking about

02:16:20.000 --> 02:16:22.000
how certain Pokemon are not going to be in

02:16:22.000 --> 02:16:24.000
what is it Sword and Shield

02:16:24.000 --> 02:16:26.000
oh yes I've heard yes

02:16:26.000 --> 02:16:28.000
yeah well

02:16:28.000 --> 02:16:30.000
I have a theory on that I've noticed something about

02:16:30.000 --> 02:16:32.000
Game Freaks ever since

02:16:32.000 --> 02:16:34.000
the Pokemon games been coming out

02:16:34.000 --> 02:16:36.000
on the 3DS because that's actually when I really started

02:16:36.000 --> 02:16:38.000
getting into the games and like

02:16:38.000 --> 02:16:40.000
collecting the games and all that type of stuff like I got

02:16:40.000 --> 02:16:42.000
black and white in the DS I think

02:16:42.000 --> 02:16:44.000
that was no actually my very first Pokemon game was

02:16:44.000 --> 02:16:46.000
Crystal for the game for

02:16:46.000 --> 02:16:48.000
the Game Boy Color but that was already like late

02:16:48.000 --> 02:16:50.000
in the Game Boy Colors days

02:16:50.000 --> 02:16:52.000
so I really started

02:16:52.000 --> 02:16:54.000
on the DS and 3DS so anyway

02:16:54.000 --> 02:16:56.000
what I noticed was that there's a big

02:16:56.000 --> 02:16:58.000
change that happened in the games between the

02:16:58.000 --> 02:17:00.000
Game Boy Color days and

02:17:00.000 --> 02:17:02.000
the DS going into 3DS and that

02:17:02.000 --> 02:17:04.000
it seems like Game Freaks has been really

02:17:04.000 --> 02:17:06.000
beginning they've been getting greedy so I know

02:17:06.000 --> 02:17:08.000
you mentioned a lot about a third game and

02:17:08.000 --> 02:17:10.000
they haven't done a third game in years

02:17:10.000 --> 02:17:12.000
what they usually do is they'll either do a sequel

02:17:12.000 --> 02:17:14.000
to the two games that already

02:17:14.000 --> 02:17:16.000
came out or they'll do like a remake

02:17:16.000 --> 02:17:18.000
of an older game so they actually give you like

02:17:18.000 --> 02:17:20.000
you know they'll start with the two games

02:17:20.000 --> 02:17:22.000
and then like that next year they'll either come

02:17:22.000 --> 02:17:24.000
out with a sequel for those two games or reimagining

02:17:24.000 --> 02:17:26.000
like what they just recently did

02:17:26.000 --> 02:17:28.000
with the past two Pokemon games where they

02:17:28.000 --> 02:17:30.000
basically released the same game but with like new footage

02:17:30.000 --> 02:17:32.000
or something and uh

02:17:32.000 --> 02:17:34.000
I think what's going on with um

02:17:34.000 --> 02:17:36.000
with Sword and Shield is they're

02:17:36.000 --> 02:17:38.000
looking at DLC I think these Pokemon are gonna

02:17:38.000 --> 02:17:40.000
come out in some type of DLC

02:17:40.000 --> 02:17:42.000
or some type of like game update that

02:17:42.000 --> 02:17:44.000
you're gonna have to pay for I think they're

02:17:44.000 --> 02:17:46.000
really trying to uh milk the Pokemon stuff

02:17:46.000 --> 02:17:48.000
perhaps I think I don't

02:17:48.000 --> 02:17:50.000
know I don't know how the fandom would feel about that

02:17:50.000 --> 02:17:52.000
but you know when you're kind of talking about that and then I see

02:17:52.000 --> 02:17:54.000
in chat Act Def says

02:17:54.000 --> 02:17:56.000
Sinnoh remakes incoming you know

02:17:56.000 --> 02:17:58.000
maybe though what what remakes would

02:17:58.000 --> 02:18:00.000
they be on they'd be on gen 4 remakes because they

02:18:00.000 --> 02:18:02.000
remade gen 1, 2, and 3 and then they remade 1

02:18:02.000 --> 02:18:04.000
again but maybe they're they might

02:18:04.000 --> 02:18:06.000
use the engine to do some type of like gen 4

02:18:06.000 --> 02:18:08.000
remake and then that would include at least

02:18:08.000 --> 02:18:10.000
all the Pokemon

02:18:10.000 --> 02:18:12.000
from 4, 3, 2, and 1 in that

02:18:12.000 --> 02:18:14.000
remake you know and that way

02:18:14.000 --> 02:18:16.000
they could kind of sidestep why they haven't included

02:18:16.000 --> 02:18:18.000
things later on and then

02:18:18.000 --> 02:18:20.000
perhaps that kind of also buys them the time

02:18:20.000 --> 02:18:22.000
while there's another you know

02:18:22.000 --> 02:18:24.000
Pokemon in the future I don't know

02:18:24.000 --> 02:18:26.000
are they allowing stuff from Let's Go to go

02:18:26.000 --> 02:18:28.000
into the new game? I don't believe

02:18:28.000 --> 02:18:30.000
so I think that's why you have that Pokemon

02:18:30.000 --> 02:18:32.000
home that's kind of supposed to be a

02:18:32.000 --> 02:18:34.000
kind of catch all for all that stuff

02:18:34.000 --> 02:18:36.000
so is it Pokemon Go into the game then?

02:18:36.000 --> 02:18:38.000
uh as far

02:18:38.000 --> 02:18:40.000
no I don't think your Pokemon from Pokemon Go can go

02:18:40.000 --> 02:18:42.000
you can see catching Pokemon in Pokemon

02:18:42.000 --> 02:18:44.000
Go is easy and

02:18:44.000 --> 02:18:46.000
you're not getting Galar stuff

02:18:46.000 --> 02:18:48.000
yet I mean the newest region Pokemon

02:18:48.000 --> 02:18:50.000
is not in

02:18:50.000 --> 02:18:52.000
say for maybe Meltan

02:18:52.000 --> 02:18:54.000
but I don't know about that

02:18:54.000 --> 02:18:56.000
so yeah but yeah

02:18:56.000 --> 02:18:58.000
I've been really

02:18:58.000 --> 02:19:00.000
ever since X and Y

02:19:00.000 --> 02:19:02.000
when they came out with the

02:19:02.000 --> 02:19:04.000
what was it they did a remake of

02:19:04.000 --> 02:19:06.000
Ruby Sapphire or something

02:19:06.000 --> 02:19:08.000
like that and I got that one in every

02:19:08.000 --> 02:19:10.000
I mean it was a great game but ever since then

02:19:10.000 --> 02:19:12.000
I was like oh no Game Freaks

02:19:12.000 --> 02:19:14.000
they're going in a totally different direction

02:19:14.000 --> 02:19:16.000
they're really going to try to milk this franchise

02:19:16.000 --> 02:19:18.000
and I'm just not liking it now

02:19:18.000 --> 02:19:20.000
like I said this Sword and Moon stuff

02:19:20.000 --> 02:19:22.000
I mean it's really got me thinking that

02:19:22.000 --> 02:19:24.000
they're going to try to mooch as much money off of this thing

02:19:24.000 --> 02:19:26.000
as they can

02:19:26.000 --> 02:19:28.000
I do want to say Act F does clarify in chat

02:19:28.000 --> 02:19:30.000
Pokemon Go Mons can be transferred

02:19:30.000 --> 02:19:32.000
to Sword and Shield through home but it won't

02:19:32.000 --> 02:19:34.000
be every Pokemon I'm so curious

02:19:34.000 --> 02:19:36.000
how that because you know like you have the Pokemon

02:19:36.000 --> 02:19:38.000
based on like one kind of set of stats

02:19:38.000 --> 02:19:40.000
in Go and I wonder how that's going to translate

02:19:40.000 --> 02:19:42.000
I imagine if you transfer it from

02:19:42.000 --> 02:19:44.000
Go you're not going to be able to get the best stat at stuff

02:19:44.000 --> 02:19:46.000
or if they're going to do it from

02:19:46.000 --> 02:19:48.000
if they're going to do it from

02:19:48.000 --> 02:19:50.000
Go they're going to do it like they did with Go Park

02:19:50.000 --> 02:19:52.000
where you have to go catch them again

02:19:54.000 --> 02:19:56.000
that could very well be I got you

02:19:56.000 --> 02:19:58.000
you got to catch them again that makes a lot of sense

02:19:58.000 --> 02:20:00.000
actually

02:20:00.000 --> 02:20:02.000
catch them again I like that that sounds like the title for the next game

02:20:02.000 --> 02:20:04.000
go catch them again dammit

02:20:04.000 --> 02:20:06.000
do it again

02:20:06.000 --> 02:20:08.000
I love it

02:20:08.000 --> 02:20:10.000
at the end of the day

02:20:10.000 --> 02:20:12.000
wait at the end of the day are you picking up

02:20:12.000 --> 02:20:14.000
Sword and Shield?

02:20:14.000 --> 02:20:16.000
oh no I don't even have a switch yet but even if I did

02:20:16.000 --> 02:20:18.000
I think I might

02:20:18.000 --> 02:20:20.000
actually bail out of Pokemon this time around

02:20:20.000 --> 02:20:22.000
and that's a first for me because

02:20:22.000 --> 02:20:24.000
I mean actually I wasn't looking

02:20:24.000 --> 02:20:26.000
forward to the next Pokemon game because that was another thing I wanted to

02:20:26.000 --> 02:20:28.000
bring up was that they used to take about five

02:20:28.000 --> 02:20:30.000
years to bring these things out and now you're just

02:20:30.000 --> 02:20:32.000
getting a Pokemon game every year like Call of Duty

02:20:32.000 --> 02:20:34.000
and every

02:20:34.000 --> 02:20:36.000
year I've been getting more and more sour towards

02:20:36.000 --> 02:20:38.000
the franchise so I doubt even if I

02:20:38.000 --> 02:20:40.000
had a switch I doubt that I'll be

02:20:40.000 --> 02:20:42.000
trying to get the Sword and Moon at least on the first day

02:20:42.000 --> 02:20:44.000
usually I get them on the first day but

02:20:44.000 --> 02:20:46.000
I doubt I would get that game day one I totally

02:20:46.000 --> 02:20:48.000
doubt it even if like I said if I had a

02:20:48.000 --> 02:20:50.000
switch or not

02:20:50.000 --> 02:20:52.000
alright so real

02:20:52.000 --> 02:20:54.000
quickly the Google Stadia I wanted to bring up

02:20:54.000 --> 02:20:56.000
please real quick yeah

02:20:56.000 --> 02:20:58.000
my main issue with

02:20:58.000 --> 02:21:00.000
that is alright so you're

02:21:00.000 --> 02:21:02.000
playing these games off of a cloud

02:21:02.000 --> 02:21:04.000
you don't actually own the game

02:21:04.000 --> 02:21:06.000
you're playing it off a server or whatever

02:21:06.000 --> 02:21:08.000
what happens when somebody like

02:21:08.000 --> 02:21:10.000
me I buy that little niche game that I

02:21:10.000 --> 02:21:12.000
really like but it's not really that popular

02:21:12.000 --> 02:21:14.000
and one day they run out of

02:21:14.000 --> 02:21:16.000
they run out of space for all the

02:21:16.000 --> 02:21:18.000
games that they collect on these servers and then they decide

02:21:18.000 --> 02:21:20.000
oh you know your game isn't that popular enough

02:21:20.000 --> 02:21:22.000
we're gonna remove it from the system

02:21:22.000 --> 02:21:24.000
just to make room for these more popular games

02:21:24.000 --> 02:21:26.000
what happens then?

02:21:26.000 --> 02:21:28.000
considering Google has been very big on

02:21:28.000 --> 02:21:30.000
just let's add more space and the

02:21:30.000 --> 02:21:32.000
the cost of or the

02:21:32.000 --> 02:21:34.000
technology of data gets

02:21:34.000 --> 02:21:36.000
it seems to get like cheaper and cheaper like your Google

02:21:36.000 --> 02:21:38.000
inbox just keeps growing and growing and growing and the

02:21:38.000 --> 02:21:40.000
amount that they let you put in there like

02:21:40.000 --> 02:21:42.000
I've probably actually

02:21:42.000 --> 02:21:44.000
gotten enough mail at this point

02:21:44.000 --> 02:21:46.000
that Google's original threshold for the

02:21:46.000 --> 02:21:48.000
inbox I've probably met but they keep

02:21:48.000 --> 02:21:50.000
expanding it so I don't know if the

02:21:50.000 --> 02:21:52.000
data and the storage

02:21:52.000 --> 02:21:54.000
if that is really going to become a question

02:21:54.000 --> 02:21:56.000
but I don't want to discount your point

02:21:56.000 --> 02:21:58.000
of delisting because

02:21:58.000 --> 02:22:00.000
sometimes it's rights issues

02:22:00.000 --> 02:22:02.000
license issues

02:22:02.000 --> 02:22:04.000
music issues those things

02:22:04.000 --> 02:22:06.000
I think would be a little bit more of a

02:22:06.000 --> 02:22:08.000
I might be concerned about that than I would be

02:22:08.000 --> 02:22:10.000
the

02:22:10.000 --> 02:22:12.000
data side of things so what would happen

02:22:12.000 --> 02:22:14.000
maybe if a licensing right or a music right

02:22:14.000 --> 02:22:16.000
expired would a game get pulled from

02:22:16.000 --> 02:22:18.000
Stadia and then what happens to your money

02:22:18.000 --> 02:22:20.000
at that point now I would assume

02:22:20.000 --> 02:22:22.000
assume that it's

02:22:22.000 --> 02:22:24.000
got to be written into these contracts

02:22:24.000 --> 02:22:26.000
with the game makers is that you can't

02:22:26.000 --> 02:22:28.000
do that like if you put your game on this

02:22:28.000 --> 02:22:30.000
platform you are not going to be able to pull it

02:22:30.000 --> 02:22:32.000
for any reason for at least

02:22:32.000 --> 02:22:34.000
maybe that like new copies

02:22:34.000 --> 02:22:36.000
can stop being sold and maybe that's how they get

02:22:36.000 --> 02:22:38.000
around the license thing but you will not be

02:22:38.000 --> 02:22:40.000
able to ever pull this game completely

02:22:40.000 --> 02:22:42.000
from the service and if they didn't put that

02:22:42.000 --> 02:22:44.000
in the contracts they are

02:22:44.000 --> 02:22:46.000
yikes

02:22:46.000 --> 02:22:48.000
well good thing you bring that up

02:22:48.000 --> 02:22:50.000
I just want to bring up one other thing I know that you guys

02:22:50.000 --> 02:22:52.000
got to get home and everything but at

02:22:52.000 --> 02:22:54.000
least Loki has to get home you're already home so

02:22:54.000 --> 02:22:56.000
but anyway

02:22:56.000 --> 02:22:58.000
what I noticed Google Play

02:22:58.000 --> 02:23:00.000
they're also a part of Google right

02:23:00.000 --> 02:23:02.000
like you know like they

02:23:02.000 --> 02:23:04.000
they're technically Google right

02:23:04.000 --> 02:23:06.000
Google Play on the alright so what I've

02:23:06.000 --> 02:23:08.000
noticed is that there's been plenty of games that I

02:23:08.000 --> 02:23:10.000
bought off of the Google Play Store

02:23:10.000 --> 02:23:12.000
and then one day I

02:23:12.000 --> 02:23:14.000
log in and my games are gone

02:23:14.000 --> 02:23:16.000
I don't get I don't get

02:23:16.000 --> 02:23:18.000
refunded half the time

02:23:18.000 --> 02:23:20.000
they're just gone so like I wonder

02:23:20.000 --> 02:23:22.000
you know you talk about their space and all that stuff

02:23:22.000 --> 02:23:24.000
and like they're just pulling stuff on the

02:23:24.000 --> 02:23:26.000
Android store they also do it on

02:23:26.000 --> 02:23:28.000
the Amazon too I have the Amazon Kindle

02:23:28.000 --> 02:23:30.000
and they remove a lot of games there too and that's

02:23:30.000 --> 02:23:32.000
mostly because

02:23:32.000 --> 02:23:34.000
developers are just taking them off

02:23:34.000 --> 02:23:36.000
for whatever reason or they're not getting updated

02:23:36.000 --> 02:23:38.000
I think these are questions that Google

02:23:38.000 --> 02:23:40.000
is going to have to take years to prove the answers

02:23:40.000 --> 02:23:42.000
to as we kind of referenced earlier and

02:23:42.000 --> 02:23:44.000
I don't know I don't know if Google's

02:23:44.000 --> 02:23:46.000
going to do it their track record doesn't make me

02:23:46.000 --> 02:23:48.000
very hopeful but we'll see we'll

02:23:48.000 --> 02:23:50.000
see what they're willing to say in the coming months

02:23:50.000 --> 02:23:52.000
especially as you know

02:23:52.000 --> 02:23:54.000
the it's about to release and the pro version

02:23:54.000 --> 02:23:56.000
comes out and those original numbers about

02:23:56.000 --> 02:23:58.000
who's using it end up coming out so we'll

02:23:58.000 --> 02:24:00.000
see we'll keep an eye on it well

02:24:00.000 --> 02:24:02.000
thanks for taking my call there like I said no

02:24:02.000 --> 02:24:04.000
shield and sword for me and no Google

02:24:04.000 --> 02:24:06.000
Stadia they can go fuck themselves

02:24:06.000 --> 02:24:08.000
alright take care guys you know

want to hit your mute button if you can hear me

02:24:26.000 --> 02:24:28.000

just we'll just add that to the old backlog

02:24:58.000 --> 02:25:00.000
let's throw that on the pile

02:25:00.000 --> 02:25:02.000
we should just make a storefront called

02:25:02.000 --> 02:25:04.000
the backlog where you just purchase games that you

02:25:04.000 --> 02:25:06.000
never intend to play

02:25:06.000 --> 02:25:08.000
just like throw it over there

OLR tonight you know I was

02:25:18.000 --> 02:25:20.000
looking for some stuff

02:25:20.000 --> 02:25:22.000
I didn't really see

02:25:22.000 --> 02:25:24.000
I saw something in like my Google

02:25:24.000 --> 02:25:26.000
news feed earlier about

02:25:26.000 --> 02:25:28.000
I

02:25:28.000 --> 02:25:30.000
had to find the story now because

02:25:30.000 --> 02:25:32.000
it was on my phone but it was something to do

02:25:32.000 --> 02:25:34.000
with we are going to close up

02:25:34.000 --> 02:25:36.000
Discord for the night by the way so sorry if you

02:25:36.000 --> 02:25:38.000
didn't get through but please consider leaving a

02:25:38.000 --> 02:25:40.000
question in the chat or of course you can always send us an email

02:25:40.000 --> 02:25:42.000
to participate at

02:25:42.000 --> 02:25:44.000
OrangeLoungeRadio.com it was about

02:25:44.000 --> 02:25:46.000
VR and it was Walmart using

02:25:46.000 --> 02:25:48.000
it to pick middle managers using

02:25:48.000 --> 02:25:50.000
VR

02:25:50.000 --> 02:25:52.000
they were using VR training

02:25:52.000 --> 02:25:54.000
I don't know what

02:25:54.000 --> 02:25:56.000
necessarily they were doing with that but

02:25:56.000 --> 02:25:58.000
that reminds me of like that

02:25:58.000 --> 02:26:00.000
one I don't know if anyone's seen the game

02:26:00.000 --> 02:26:02.000
play video of the KFC

02:26:02.000 --> 02:26:04.000
VR game which I totally want to play at

02:26:04.000 --> 02:26:06.000
some point I don't know how to get to

02:26:06.000 --> 02:26:08.000
it but apparently it's like some VR game

02:26:08.000 --> 02:26:10.000
that they have for KFC it's fucking weird

02:26:10.000 --> 02:26:12.000
it's like Burger King

02:26:12.000 --> 02:26:14.000
games I feel like that came up on the show

02:26:14.000 --> 02:26:16.000
not that long ago it was the KFC training

02:26:16.000 --> 02:26:18.000
we talked about that on the show a few weeks ago it was a while ago

02:26:18.000 --> 02:26:20.000
but yeah it's interesting

02:26:20.000 --> 02:26:22.000
it's about time Burger King or

02:26:22.000 --> 02:26:24.000
KFC or McDonald's I don't give

02:26:24.000 --> 02:26:26.000
a shit who makes a fucking weird ass game

02:26:26.000 --> 02:26:28.000
but it's about time that we had some weird

02:26:28.000 --> 02:26:30.000
ass games based on food franchises

02:26:30.000 --> 02:26:32.000
and I'll be honest it's the

02:26:32.000 --> 02:26:34.000
time for VR we need fucking weird

02:26:34.000 --> 02:26:36.000
ass creepy shit

02:26:36.000 --> 02:26:38.000
food franchise

02:26:38.000 --> 02:26:40.000
VR games I just hope I want them now

02:26:40.000 --> 02:26:42.000
I just hope the VR training games are teaching them

02:26:42.000 --> 02:26:44.000
to double check the order before they

02:26:44.000 --> 02:26:46.000
pass it to the customer no I want it fucking creepy

02:26:46.000 --> 02:26:48.000
as shit I want it sneak king shit

02:26:48.000 --> 02:26:50.000
that this is what I'm looking for

02:26:52.000 --> 02:26:54.000
I miss those Burger King games from the icebox

02:26:54.000 --> 02:26:56.000
they're so so interesting

02:26:56.000 --> 02:26:58.000
so I think back where there is with it

02:26:58.000 --> 02:27:00.000
is that backwards compatible yet Emma can I get that

02:27:00.000 --> 02:27:02.000
as part of my games with gold

02:27:02.000 --> 02:27:04.000
that would be worth it right there

02:27:04.000 --> 02:27:06.000
come on Burger King make it happen

02:27:06.000 --> 02:27:08.000
oh boy alright anything else for last

02:27:08.000 --> 02:27:10.000

somebody that likes to stream games yourself

02:28:08.000 --> 02:28:10.000
that helps a lot

02:28:10.000 --> 02:28:12.000
a lot a lot that all being

02:28:12.000 --> 02:28:14.000
said I think we can get final thoughts

02:28:14.000 --> 02:28:16.000
we're about to wrap up so Loki

02:28:16.000 --> 02:28:18.000
final thought my final thought

02:28:18.000 --> 02:28:20.000
is I have no

02:28:20.000 --> 02:28:22.000
idea what I'm doing for the fourth this year

02:28:22.000 --> 02:28:24.000
probably watch fireworks

02:28:24.000 --> 02:28:26.000
but I need to play games and work on my game

02:28:26.000 --> 02:28:28.000
definitely work on my game

02:28:28.000 --> 02:28:30.000
yeah my
