2
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:18,680
as well.

3
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:21,680
We're recapping our favorite pieces of news from the keynotes, show floor, nearby vicinity

00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:36,100
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show

9
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:37,980
where every gamer has a voice.

10
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:42,620
It is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight with episode number 780.

11
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:44,620
Uh oh, I got a problem in the title.

12
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:48,900
For this June the 16th of 2019.

13
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:54,620
My name is Rob Roberts and joining me, welcome back tonight, DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

14
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:55,620
Oh hi.

15
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:56,620
Hi, how are you?

16
00:00:56,620 --> 00:00:57,620
Okay.

17
00:00:57,620 --> 00:00:58,620
Yeah, well we missed you last week.

18
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:00,780
What did you throw?

19
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:04,980
Our aim is always going to be improving though, but I hope you had a good weekend.

20
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:05,980
I know you had a very busy weekend.

21
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:07,620
No, last week was a clusterfuck.

22
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:08,620
Last weekend was a clusterfuck.

23
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:10,380
Sorry to hear it.

24
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:12,700
But hey, I lived.

25
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:13,700
That's right.

26
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:14,700
You lived to tell the tale.

27
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:16,300
I'll just put it this way.

28
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:17,300
Sack pride was drama.

29
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:19,980
Yeah, it was a lot of drama.

30
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:24,820
All right, anyway, Drama Free joining me to my right, your guys' left on TV.

31
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:26,180
Say hello to Techmaster Loki.

32
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:27,900
I wish I was drama free.

33
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:32,300
But you don't have a lot of drama to bring, well not that Jamie brings drama to the show,

34
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:33,300
but it is.

35
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:34,820
No, I didn't bring any of it to the show.

36
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:37,780
But what you did bring, and I'm so excited about this y'all, I'm so excited to show this

37
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:42,460
and I'll talk about this with our podcast listeners, but you actually picked me up an

38
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:44,780
early birthday gift and I'm so excited about it.

39
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:46,180
It's a mini Commodore 64.

40
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:47,180
Yes.

41
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:48,900
Look Bobby, finally got one of these.

42
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:51,340
Tell me a little bit about what made you decide to pick one of these up.

43
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:54,020
The Evil G has it $50 off retail.

44
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:55,020
Yeah.

45
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:56,780
So that's why.

46
00:01:56,780 --> 00:02:01,340
And I think it's because they're clearing the shelves for the new one that will probably

47
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:02,340
come out this year.

48
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:06,180
Because I heard there's supposed to be like a C64 fat this year, full size.

49
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:07,180
I don't know, maybe.

50
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:08,180
Oh yeah, I already got you your present.

51
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:10,580
Oh, well y'all don't have to give me presents.

52
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:14,340
Well no, the pre-order thing.

53
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:15,740
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

54
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:16,780
So here's the thing.

55
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:22,100
So Orange House Radio actually next week is going to be, I almost said 23 years old, but

56
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,940
on the 23rd will be 17 years old.

57
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:29,220
Our first broadcast was actually, and it's the right date too, our first broadcast was

58
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:31,620
June 23rd, 2002.

59
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:35,380
So next week is going to mark our 17th birthday, but the just kind of ironic thing is that

60
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:38,740
my personal birthday is three days after that, June 26th.

61
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:41,180
So it just kind of, it kind of works out well.

62
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:43,380
And I mean it, I don't really need presents.

63
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:48,380
I appreciate them, but having you guys here every week to do this show with is a present

64
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:49,380
in and of itself.

65
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:50,380
I just couldn't pass it up.

66
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:55,500
It was like either a PlayStation classic mini or that I was like, well, I'm not buying that.

67
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,300
So I think you made the right decision.

68
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:59,300
I did make the right decision.

69
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:00,300
All right.

70
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:06,620
Uh, so Hey, we've got a lot of gaming news to get into because this week is E3 part two

71
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:09,780
and there's just a lot going on in the gaming world.

72
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:13,500
Last week when we were doing our show, we were right in the midst of everything, you

73
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:16,580
know, with the Microsoft event having gone earlier that day.

74
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:19,980
This time, you know, it's, it's been done for a couple of days now.

75
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:22,580
It's interesting because E3, actually, even though it's like a three day show, it feels

76
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:26,900
like it's a week because you have like your three days of press conferences and then that

77
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:29,940
overlaps a little bit with three days of show.

78
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:31,180
So it's kind of like a full week.

79
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:32,700
It's kind of interesting how all that works.

80
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:36,340
But uh, in this week we had some more press conferences.

81
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:39,860
So let's start off with what I kind of think is the big one for a lot of people.

82
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:42,640
Let's start off with Nintendo.

83
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:46,140
Now Dark Sakura, you're back after being gone for a week.

84
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:49,740
So I want to let you start with it because I know there's at least one thing that got

85
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:50,740
your attention.

86
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:51,740
There are two things that got my attention.

87
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:52,740
Okay, go for it.

88
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:58,140
So number one of course, Animal Crossing and I have sat and not only did I watch the trailer,

89
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:03,100
but I watched the sponsored gameplay, you know, where they have the translators and

90
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:04,780
everything and showing all the neat stuff.

91
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:08,820
I've already decided that when the game comes out, I'm making a web comic out of it and

92
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:12,780
it's going to be called Fuck You Nook.

93
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:15,260
I might name it Worst Vacation Ever.

94
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:18,020
I haven't decided, but I'm really excited about it.

95
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:21,260
It looks like how I wanted it to, and it's got some neat stuff in there.

96
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:25,140
I kind of dig the DIY stuff, so I'm really, really pleased.

97
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:26,140
I'm looking forward to March.

98
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:27,140
It'll be right before my birthday.

99
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:30,160
It'll be a perfect present.

100
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,260
What do you think about the whole setup where it's like, it's kind of funny the way it was

101
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:36,540
set up because they're like, oh, we're going to kick you off on a desert island.

102
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:39,400
You win a prize, all expenses paid.

103
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,660
You're stuck with no shit.

104
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:42,540
But people are moving there, right?

105
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:43,880
So are they moving to your desert island?

106
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:44,880
Is that the trick?

107
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:45,880
I guess so.

108
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:48,640
You could see very plainly in the gameplay that some of your favorites-

109
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:49,640
There's Hammy.

110
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:50,640
Yeah, are back.

111
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:51,640
His name isn't Hammy.

112
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:52,640
It's like Hamlet.

113
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:53,640
Hamlet.

114
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:54,640
Hamlet was in the playthrough.

115
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:55,640
I'm like, oh.

116
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:58,880
And I've got so many names now memorized because they're all in pocket camp.

117
00:04:58,880 --> 00:04:59,880
Mm-hmm.

118
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:00,880
Sorry.

119
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,880
I've been eating cinnamon rolls because I went to IKEA.

120
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:04,880
That's fine.

121
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:05,880
They're delicious too.

122
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:06,880
Look at this.

123
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,240
I'm trying very hard not to eat on stream.

124
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,240
Cinnamon roll.

125
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,240
Half eaten cinnamon roll.

126
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,240
How appetizing.

127
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,240
Because IKEA.

128
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,240
So.

129
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,240
Anyway.

130
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,600
Animal Crossing.

131
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,600
Animal Crossing.

132
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,040
So but I'm really pleased with the updates to the graphical style because it really lends

133
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:25,720
itself very well to the Switch's capabilities.

134
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:30,280
I think the biggest thing that was in that trailer that really like sold me on this is

135
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,280
like an upgrade.

136
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:35,160
And you're all gonna laugh because it's not that big a deal, but I'm like, this changes

137
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,160
everything.

138
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,160
Multiply?

139
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:40,560
The fact that you can decorate outside your house as well.

140
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,560
Yes.

141
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,560
That changes everything.

142
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,160
I'm gonna make a trailer.

143
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,400
Because now I'm like, oh, this game's got like a Stardew Valley.

144
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,920
With a broken car and some tires.

145
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:54,840
But there was definitely like, I don't know, I felt it like a Stardew Valley influence

146
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:55,840
on that trailer.

147
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:56,840
I might.

148
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:57,840
Now we can really trap them in fences.

149
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:03,000
It's a lot of the crafting and DIY-ness that people seem to really like a lot more lately.

150
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Yeah.

151
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,300
So I think the fact that now you can decorate the outdoors and now you're gonna be able

152
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:08,800
to really make that island your own.

153
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,960
I think that's a game changer because, you know, in the earliest Animal Crossings, it

154
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:18,600
was, was it put in a number between one and a thousand and it's a seed for a random map.

155
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:22,600
But it's like, you know, you're so constrained and it's like you keep re-rolling until you

156
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,600
get the one you want.

157
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,780
But if you really, and maybe some of that will be true too, still with like where the

158
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:27,920
animals move to.

159
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:33,360
But if you really have the freedom to redecorate and like, you know, you can put like really

160
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,400
hateful things in front of the animals' homes who you don't like.

161
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,840
I can't wait to make signs.

162
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:41,720
I just want Deanna to live in my village on my island.

163
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:46,280
And I want, um, I want to kick Ed into orbit.

164
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:51,800
By the way, I have a new, I have a character that I hadn't seen before named Julian who

165
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:54,720
lives in Pocket Camp.

166
00:06:54,720 --> 00:07:00,240
And he's a unicorn that wears an outfit with, with stars and stuff on it.

167
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,880
And that guy was in my town at one point.

168
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:05,160
Well, you know, you know, in the game that you have to, you know, you can sometimes like

169
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:08,060
help me pick out a present for this person.

170
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:11,440
And I picked out a handbag for Julian and he's like, I love it.

171
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:17,320
So Julian is now my, um, drag queen in my game.

172
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:19,280
So animal crossing, you're very, very happy about that.

173
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,280
Yeah.

174
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,280
Very, very happy.

175
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,680
How do you feel about the delay till March?

176
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,680
I'm glad.

177
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,680
Yeah.

178
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:28,640
I'd rather it be complete than deal with, you know, Apache piece of shit.

179
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:32,200
And did you hear that, um, they actually commented about the whole, like, cause Nintendo was

180
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:36,120
asked about this crunch time thing in this industry and they actually said, you know,

181
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:40,120
well, you know, they didn't kind of say like animal crossing was delayed due to that, but

182
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:44,320
they did kind of come out and say, well, we're not afraid to do things that encourage

183
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,320
a work life balance.

184
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:49,240
In fact, you may have heard us say that we're delaying animal crossing.

185
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:51,360
We're looking at you Sakurai.

186
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:55,800
So they did, they bumped it back, assumably to avoid crunch time and all that stuff.

187
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,020
So I I'm, I'm okay with it.

188
00:07:58,020 --> 00:07:59,740
We are looking at you Sakurai.

189
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:02,280
We're not crunching on our net code at all.

190
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:05,280
In fact, we're probably just not going to even put it in at all either.

191
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,280
All right.

192
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:09,320
And anyway, and the other thing I'm super happy about though, I'm sure a lot of us are

193
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:14,300
as a sequel to breath of the wild and I've already got some theories about it, but the

194
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:17,800
one of them actually has to do with Zelda's hair.

195
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:18,800
Okay.

196
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,280
Tell, tell us a little bit about this theory.

197
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,280
Okay.

198
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:25,040
So you noticed in the trailer that Zelda's hair is cut short.

199
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:32,040
Usually it's easier to do a female character with short hair if they're going to be playable.

200
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:36,840
So you think that Zelda is going to be a playable character or maybe chic type of thing.

201
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:37,840
We'll see.

202
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:42,180
But my other, my other thing too, is that the Ganon, the thing that they find under

203
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:47,260
there is the original Ganon from Twilight princess because of where the hand was holding

204
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:48,260
it down.

205
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:53,300
I'm, I have a very firm feeling that breath of the wild is going to start bringing in

206
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:56,320
that continuity that they've really been trying to bring back together.

207
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,840
I do it like, don't get me wrong.

208
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:01,760
I was, I was happy to hear them acknowledge breath of the wild too, but it's one of those

209
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:04,020
things where I'm like, we've been new, like this game.

210
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:06,000
Of course they're making another Zelda.

211
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,920
Of course, after the rave reviews, breath of the wild guy and the, the 10 out of tens

212
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,280
and the sales that that game had.

213
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:17,000
And the fact that that game probably was a huge part of elevating the switch to the level

214
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
it's at now.

215
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Duh.

216
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,240
Of course you're going to make another game in its engine, but it's, it's still, I didn't

217
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,760
think it was going to be a direct sequel though.

218
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:24,760
That's that's fair.

219
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:27,560
Like I was expecting it to go like a Majora's mass type of direction where it's like a new

220
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:29,080
experience just in the same engine.

221
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:31,840
So the fact, well, to be fair, we don't have a title.

222
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:34,080
No, but it is a direct sequel.

223
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,080
Okay.

224
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:39,960
So in this case, number one, they said sequel number two outfits are the same.

225
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:40,960
Yeah.

226
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:44,840
Uh, from what I can tell voice acting is the same, even though we just heard gasps, the

227
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:47,000
layout of the land was the same, the castle was the same.

228
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Okay.

229
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,160
And yeah, we don't see that happen a lot where there's like a direct sequel like that.

230
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:55,200
Like obviously all the Zelda games have played in the same universe, but you're right.

231
00:09:55,200 --> 00:10:00,320
That's kind of, and in breath of the wild, they said over and over that the evil came

232
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,560
underneath Hyrule castle.

233
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:06,320
When they did their discovery, it was clearly under Hyrule castle because you see the castle

234
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,320
rise.

235
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,320
Right.

236
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:14,040
So, um, the other, you know, with the frame by frame analysis, I'd watched it a few times

237
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:18,040
because I love breath of the wild and I love the lore that it set up a nifty eight Oh five

238
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:19,040
in our chat room.

239
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:22,720
We do have a live chat room because of course we do tape live every Sunday night at the

240
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:26,140
voice of geeks network, twitch.tv slash vog network.

241
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:28,600
That's V O G or voice of geeks network vog network.

242
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:31,920
If you want to follow along and then you can get more information at vog network.com.

243
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:35,440
Cause we have a lot of audio only shows that you should be checking out as well.

244
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:39,120
Um, but uh, we do tape live and we have our chat room at twitch.tv slash vog network and

245
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,920
nifty eight Oh five says dark Sakura with the receipts.

246
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:42,920
Yes.

247
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:43,920
The other thing too.

248
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,640
Oh, she's got a CVS receipt.

249
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:50,960
I got one question and she's got a receipt a mile long.

250
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:53,280
Well just other, other things too that led into it.

251
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:58,320
I had always wanted them to do, I was really wanting more DLC where it was Lincoln, Zelda

252
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,120
going around fixing shit.

253
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:05,440
Like I've had this whole thing in my head about her trying to, you know, that the treasury

254
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:10,040
is intact and hiring people and rebuilding the castle town and Lon Lon ranch and all

255
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,040
that crap.

256
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,960
Cause you know, the ruins of Lon Lon ranch or what's supposed to be and the castle town

257
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:14,960
are all there.

258
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:15,960
You know?

259
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:16,960
So I was looking at all of that.

260
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:21,680
But the other thing that makes me think that this is the true Gannon that's under the castle

261
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:25,620
is cause everything was something Gannon like a description.

262
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:33,120
And I truly believe that all of those were a, uh, a projection of the original Gannon.

263
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,000
And I like that theory.

264
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:41,460
I really liked the idea of it, that there's just so much evil wrapped up in this creature

265
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:45,620
that by them destroying all of the projections, cause they said that, you know, in the game

266
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:48,100
it was said that this is the final form.

267
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:51,660
It's ready to sacrifice itself fully for its mission.

268
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:56,720
And then that's when the real Gannon wakes up because it has no other forms to project.

269
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:00,400
So anyway, I've, I've got, I've got thoughts, thoughts.

270
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:04,860
And from a non lore perspective, I'm dark to see from a, from how to build the game

271
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:09,000
perspective says it would be easier to reuse a lot of the same code and engine instead

272
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,740
of building a new game from the ground up.

273
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:11,740
Oh, absolutely.

274
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:13,540
I kind of always expected, but you're right.

275
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:16,340
It's more like a direct sequel as opposed to it's a new Zelda story.

276
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:17,340
It's just in the same engine.

277
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:22,540
Well, and now the other thing, the other thing too is that, um, have you ever watched, there's,

278
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:28,940
there's a YouTube channel I love called Boundary Break and, um, well, and I had already known

279
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:32,700
some of this cause I like to see like, well, you know how I was in world of Warcraft when

280
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:35,500
I got my demon Hunter.

281
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:41,020
Like we all did like end of time and two hours later I'm like, I'm still an end of time outside

282
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:42,120
the boundaries.

283
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:46,860
You know, I'm in Dalaran now, an instance Dalaran, um, you know, I do stuff like that.

284
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:50,620
So I love Boundary Break and you know, just looking into the complexity of how they built

285
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:56,500
the game and that you've actually got rendered land outside of the borders.

286
00:12:56,500 --> 00:13:00,740
It makes me think they could do so much more with the engine that they probably had the

287
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:04,160
capacity to and just did not.

288
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,400
This is our developed area.

289
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,660
The rest of it is no man's land.

290
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:13,300
Mistake theory with a perspective in our chat saying, I love when Nintendo does direct sequels,

291
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:14,500
silver and white too.

292
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:18,420
I think you mean black and white too for Pokemon are probably my two favorite Pokemon games

293
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:19,420
for that reason.

294
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:20,420
Yeah.

295
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:23,260
So, um, anything else on the Zelda sequel?

296
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:24,260
Cause I want to talk.

297
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:28,340
So, so dark Sakura's mentioned, those are the two things that got her going excited.

298
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:30,500
And those, those, yeah.

299
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:35,460
And nifty 805 says Lincoln, Zelda are the new sunny and share and Sia Tabiri says, so

300
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:38,100
link should avoid skiing and Zelda is basically immortal.

301
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:39,100
Oh geez.

302
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:40,100
All right.

303
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:41,100
And does she believe in life after love?

304
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:42,100
All right.

305
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:43,100
Anyway.

306
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:44,940
So those are the two things that got you excited.

307
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:45,940
Also shipping.

308
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:49,700
I'm very excited about those games as well, but let me talk about the things that got

309
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:53,940
me going like, okay, so here's the big thing.

310
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:57,340
And Jamie, you have to appreciate this as well.

311
00:13:57,340 --> 00:14:04,180
Um, so we heard the rumors that the collection of mana was going to come out in the U S right.

312
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:07,860
Although I full expected that they were going to do the lazy and they were just going to

313
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:12,220
take final fantasy adventure, secret of mana, and they were either going to cut second and

314
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:15,900
two, three, or they were going to give a secret of evermore instead, which I actually would

315
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:16,900
have been okay with that.

316
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:17,900
You know, I have that cartridge.

317
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:18,900
Yeah, I do.

318
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:19,900
I do too.

319
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:20,900
Plot twist.

320
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:22,500
Um, I don't have a lot of games, but that's one of them.

321
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:25,260
And I always think that game got a lot more crap than it really deserved.

322
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:26,260
I thought it was fine.

323
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:31,860
Um, but then they came out and said, Oh yeah, the collection of mana is coming out.

324
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:37,300
And by the way, second, it's at two, three is now trials of mana and it's out today.

325
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:38,940
And I was like, bye.

326
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:39,940
Yeah.

327
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:43,300
Collection of mana is out on what girl I've played it on the switch.

328
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:44,900
Holy crap.

329
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:45,900
You didn't catch that.

330
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:46,900
No.

331
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:50,180
Cause I keep in mind, I've also been at work and had the drama.

332
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:51,180
No, I got you.

333
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:52,180
I got you.

334
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:53,180
So I'm going to miss it.

335
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:54,180
Yes, girl.

336
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:55,180
You can play on the East door.

337
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:56,180
Yeah.

338
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:57,180
Okay.

339
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:58,180
I'm going to go get my switch in the other room right now.

340
00:14:58,180 --> 00:14:59,180
I'm messaging Dan right now.

341
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:00,180
You can play second.

342
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:02,780
It's at two, three, the official English version right now.

343
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:08,100
In fact, actually on my personal Twitch stream at Rob Roberts, cheap plug, uh, like on Wednesday

344
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:09,100
and Friday this week.

345
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:11,940
I've played through about two hours on stream, maybe a little longer, two and a half hours

346
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:13,580
on stream and played some of the game.

347
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:18,080
It's really like I did play the translated ROM a little bit, a long time ago, but I was

348
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,080
kind of like lost.

349
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:22,580
I didn't really know what I was doing and not to say that's necessarily changed, but

350
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:27,020
I do feel like with the official English translation, I'm, I'm kind of like, I dunno, I'm a little

351
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:30,420
bit like able to figure stuff out and go in the right directions.

352
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:32,020
That's uh, that's really cool.

353
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:33,560
Now here's the other thing.

354
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:37,340
So not only did they announce that trials of mana or second, it says your three is out

355
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:41,380
today in the English version of the collection of mana, but they announced we are working

356
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:42,740
on a remake.

357
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:48,300
So trials of mana is already being remade, just like they did secretive mana like earlier,

358
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:50,780
like it was about last year, they did secretive mana.

359
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:52,840
Now not everybody loved that remake.

360
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:57,060
It had its issues, but Square Enix is saying, and they're talking about, we have learned

361
00:15:57,060 --> 00:16:00,620
from some of the issues of this and this is what we're going to do different with trials

362
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:01,620
of mana.

363
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:04,860
So it is nice to hear the company say we're doing some things differently.

364
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:09,060
Um, so yeah, I'm like already excited for that remake as well.

365
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:13,020
So, um, and you know what I've, I've been playing, it's, it's different.

366
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:16,820
Trials of mana is different because like the beginning of the story is different depending

367
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:18,780
on who you start with and how you build your party.

368
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:19,780
Well, right.

369
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:25,460
And because you, you're basically taking, uh, three different storylines out of seven

370
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:29,820
players, six, six, and building it from there.

371
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:30,820
Yeah.

372
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:33,480
So, but yeah, anyway, so if you want to check out trials of mana, it's out now.

373
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:36,440
So that was, that was definitely one of the big ones that got me going, what?

374
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:41,200
Um, and then I would say as far as like games coming out today, uh, then they released that

375
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,200
cadence of Hyrule.

376
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:46,920
I mean, it wasn't today, but it was still like what by the end of E3 cadence of Hyrule

377
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:51,120
came out, uh, which, you know, I haven't been able to play yet, sadly, because here's the

378
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,120
thing.

379
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:55,120
And y'all have even called me out on this on Twitch.

380
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:58,000
If I buy cadence of Hyrule, what's going to happen?

381
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,080
I will suddenly stop playing trials of mana and not get any further.

382
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:03,120
So I have not bought.

383
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:08,360
Well, then I will be playing through it because I don't really care about cadence of Hyrule.

384
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:10,240
I didn't like Crypt of the Necrodancer.

385
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,240
It just wasn't fun to me.

386
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,240
Yeah.

387
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:15,240
Well, you know, apparently they've made some changes to make it a little, I don't want

388
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:19,960
to say to make it easier, but to make it feel a little less grindy, like, I guess you don't

389
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:23,320
necessarily lose everything like you would in a lot of roguelikes.

390
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:26,060
You don't necessarily lose everything when you die and go back to start.

391
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:29,240
So they have tried to make some, I guess, quality of life improvements probably to appeal

392
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:31,440
a little more to Zelda fans in that regard.

393
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:35,320
If there was something else I was a little excited about was the Panzer Dragoon remake.

394
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,320
Yes.

395
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,320
How could I forget?

396
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:38,320
Oh, my God.

397
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,320
You know, what's funny?

398
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:42,440
The news about the remake was already out there because I was like, I feel like did

399
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:46,560
we and it what we did mention on a previous episode that but it was kind of like almost

400
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:47,560
an aside.

401
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:49,840
All it was was that we know these companies are working on it.

402
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:54,240
We don't know where we don't know when we don't know how, but it turns out Nintendo,

403
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,480
it's a switch game.

404
00:17:55,480 --> 00:18:00,040
So somebody brought up during Bobby's show, though, a Panzer Dragoon VR.

405
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:04,200
I know you ain't all about VR, but I got to say, when I heard that was like, oh, things

406
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:08,240
I didn't know I needed until you said it, there's a couple other things I was really

407
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,240
excited about.

408
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:10,240
Yeah, please.

409
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:14,440
I mean, I'm actually disappointed about the Dark Crystal RPG.

410
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:15,640
That was like a surprise, wasn't it?

411
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:18,600
I hate tactics games, but you're going to try it anyway.

412
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:19,600
No, I won't.

413
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:20,600
No.

414
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:21,600
OK.

415
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,600
I know I don't like tactics games.

416
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:23,600
I've tried to like tactics games.

417
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,480
I'm like, I'm going to love this game.

418
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:26,480
I love this.

419
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,480
No, I hate it.

420
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:28,480
I can't play Fire Emblem.

421
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,480
I can't play.

422
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:33,720
I tried to love the Macross one back in the day, and I hate them.

423
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:34,720
See, here's the weird thing.

424
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:35,720
Like, I'm with you.

425
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:37,400
Like most tactic games I can't get into.

426
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:39,200
I have tried to get into Sky Eye.

427
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:42,880
I've tried to get into Fire Emblem.

428
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,120
I just don't get into it.

429
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:47,520
But Final Fantasy Tactics, give me more.

430
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:51,760
Like I would give me another Final Fantasy Tactics like seriously.

431
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:56,120
The other thing I was really happy about and I saw it and then forgot about it, but I was

432
00:18:56,120 --> 00:19:04,600
still happy, was John Romero doing a game, but I didn't see anything about zombies.

433
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:06,160
And then Contra Rogue Corps.

434
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,160
Contra.

435
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,160
Yeah.

436
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:11,880
It looks like hot garbage, but I'll probably play it anyways.

437
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,080
And I don't give a shit about Witcher.

438
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:18,280
Well, it's done by the same guy that did Contra 3 and one of the other Contra games.

439
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:20,420
So it's one of the original creators.

440
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:23,720
So I'm down for that, but it just looks like hot garbage.

441
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:27,780
But it should be noted that the other big it's out today announcement, because we love

442
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:29,640
it when Nintendo does those, right?

443
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:32,320
The other big it's out today is the Contra collection.

444
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:35,520
So Jamie, if you missed the memo, I mean, you're probably like, I already own all those

445
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:36,520
games.

446
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:39,160
But if there's something you're missing in that Contra collection, that all came out

447
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:40,160
as well.

448
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,160
Just dropped.

449
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:42,240
It's nice to have it in one place.

450
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,240
I think possibly.

451
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:49,080
I mean, also I'm a little bit weirded about Luigi's Mansion 3, although I'm looking forward

452
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:50,760
to co-op because I would play that with Dan.

453
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:53,120
Do you know how many memes I've seen already about Gooigi?

454
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:59,200
Anyway, SSG100Matt kind of sums up the new Contra game saying, yeah, that Contra game

455
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:03,880
looks like it knows what it is and could be totally fun, can't be trash.

456
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:04,880
That's what Contra 3 was.

457
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:05,880
I'm actually.

458
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:06,880
That sounds like me.

459
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:07,880
Actually, I'm.

460
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:08,880
I'm totally fun, can't be trash.

461
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:14,240
You know, if Contra is self-aware like that, and to be fair, there's a playable panda bear

462
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,400
I spotted in that.

463
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:21,580
So that on the self-aware meter makes me think if Contra is self-aware that it can't be trash,

464
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:23,240
that actually could be a great thing.

465
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:24,240
That's Contra 3.

466
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:28,080
You were jumping from missiles, I mean, from missile to missile.

467
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,080
It was can't be trash.

468
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:31,240
It's a very kind of Bayonetta thing.

469
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:32,240
Loki, let me ask you.

470
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,800
I mean, we've we've talked about our faves from Nintendo.

471
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:35,800
What what caught your eye?

472
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:36,800
The Contra thing?

473
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:37,800
When I saw.

474
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:40,000
OK, I know there was one other thing that had to catch your eye on that.

475
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
The No More Heroes.

476
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Yeah, No More Heroes 3.

477
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
I don't.

478
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
I don't remember two, though.

479
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:45,600
I played through one.

480
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:46,600
Yeah.

481
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:47,600
I think maybe.

482
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:48,600
No More Heroes 2 did come out.

483
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:52,440
We need like a collection to come back because I haven't I don't remember them very well.

484
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:56,160
But yeah, No More Heroes 3 looks crazy.

485
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:58,160
So that'll be neat.

486
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:01,400
I was kind of underwhelmed by all of it.

487
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:04,920
And I know that's a horrible thing to say, but I was underwhelmed by all of it.

488
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:05,920
It was just kind of.

489
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:06,920
Did you?

490
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:07,920
OK.

491
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:11,420
Did you maybe like I have to admit at the end of it, I was kind of like, oh, you know,

492
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:12,980
because I want.

493
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:16,940
It's so weird because, OK, I'm going to get so much shit for this deservedly, but I don't

494
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:17,940
care.

495
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:19,820
I'm I'm living my truth.

496
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:25,020
When they announced the Breath of the Wild sequel, I was kind of like, oh, OK, yeah,

497
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:26,020
great.

498
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:27,020
Like, we knew that was going to happen.

499
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:30,340
Yet another game that we can add to the list that's in development, like Metroid Prime

500
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:31,340
4, you know?

501
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:32,340
Yeah.

502
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:37,540
There was that part of me that was like, I kind of wanted to see more on Bayonetta 3.

503
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:38,540
I would have loved enough.

504
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:43,060
Where I hope they put out that Metroid Prime trilogy.

505
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:47,180
But I like, you know, that was my like initial gut reaction.

506
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:50,500
But then, like a couple hours later, I really looked back and I said, wait a minute, Rob,

507
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,620
you're doing that thing that you tell people not to do.

508
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:55,740
Don't set these expectations for things you want to see.

509
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:57,900
And then when they don't appear, you're just going to get disappointed because I took a

510
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:58,900
step back and really looked at it.

511
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:01,300
I was like, you know, Nintendo really did have a fun year.

512
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:02,300
They had a lot of stuff.

513
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:04,740
So did what I'm asking you, look, did you maybe make that same mistake?

514
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:07,180
Did you know I had no expectations?

515
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:10,940
I had no expectations, but like some of these games, like a Panzer Dragoon remake is like,

516
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:13,260
it wasn't something I was looking for.

517
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:17,420
So I didn't really care that they're making it, you know, same with the new Contra game

518
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:22,780
looked OK, but it was like, oh, my God, I got to play that, you know, it's and I don't

519
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:24,360
really play Smash too much.

520
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:27,420
So, of course, they had, you know, the big announcement is Badger Kazooie is in Smash

521
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:32,460
now as a character, as well as Dragon Quest Hero.

522
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:33,660
I think you want to add to this, Jamie.

523
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:37,480
I was just saying if they were going to do Panzer Dragoon, why don't they go and get

524
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:42,300
what people really want and do Panzer Dragoon Saga or RPG?

525
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:46,840
Well, maybe, you know, if one does well, it leads to the next kind of like I would say,

526
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:49,780
because that Secret of Mana remake did well enough, it convinced them, you know, even

527
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:52,940
if it maybe wasn't here, maybe did better in Japan, I don't know, but I think it did

528
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:53,940
fine enough here.

529
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:57,500
I think it did well enough where now they went and they did trials of Mana and we're

530
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:59,220
getting an English version because of it.

531
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:00,220
They're taking that effort.

532
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:04,580
So, I mean, if a game does well, they might be encouraged to do more.

533
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:08,300
Now I will say this before y'all like drag me about and cancel me about what I just said

534
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:09,580
about Nintendo.

535
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:10,740
Here's the thing, though.

536
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:15,060
Here's what Nintendo does very well with their direct.

537
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:19,620
And like I give them an A plus on this, honestly, where I don't think Microsoft really does

538
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:20,620
this.

539
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:22,700
I don't think Square Enix or any of the other ones we're going to talk about really did

540
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:23,920
this.

541
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:29,060
Nintendo did a great job in that I would say maybe like 90% of those trailers save for

542
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:32,740
maybe like the No More Heroes and a couple others, 90% of those trailers.

543
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:37,820
And I made up that statistic, but I feel like most of what we saw, you saw gameplay.

544
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:41,340
You didn't just see a pre-rendered CG announcement thing.

545
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:43,200
You saw gameplay.

546
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:46,220
You saw what those games really look like.

547
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:51,560
And that gets me more excited about the games when I can see, oh, that's the game I'm going

548
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:52,740
to be playing.

549
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:55,820
What have I been sitting here bellyaching about Death Stranding for years and years

550
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:57,040
on this show?

551
00:23:57,040 --> 00:24:02,680
As rad as it is, as great as this cast looks, as much as I love Hideo Kojima, where's the

552
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:03,680
fucking game?

553
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:08,320
And they did, they did finally show it to us, but still I have this sense of, I'm not

554
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:13,520
sure what it really looks like, you know, I'll probably buy it anyway because Kojima,

555
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,560
but what is the game?

556
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:16,560
You know?

557
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:22,080
So anyway, I love that Nintendo shows the game and I give them major props for that.

558
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,080
I do.

559
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:24,080
So.

560
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:25,880
I'm not saying it was bad.

561
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:30,240
I'm just saying that like, I'm not entirely excited about all the stuff that they have.

562
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:34,840
Animal Crossing looks okay, but like I, my expectations for Animal Crossing aren't very

563
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:35,840
high either.

564
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:40,200
It's just, I'll play it when it comes out, but like, I don't know, there wasn't really

565
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:45,480
anything that had me jumping up and down like, oh my God, I need to buy this, you know, whatever.

566
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:46,640
It's fine.

567
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:49,400
That's how I kind of buy things on the Switch anyways.

568
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:52,480
Now SSGL 100 Matt says something that I kind of agree with too.

569
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:56,000
I was really disappointed that there wasn't any Nintendo online news.

570
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,920
I really hope they were going to be saying, yeah, yeah, that is kind of disappointing,

571
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:03,800
but Bobby has a really good point and I was disappointed at first too, but then I kind

572
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:08,560
of took a step back and realized they could kind of do a direct about that whenever they

573
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:10,940
want and people will still receive it.

574
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:13,400
And I think Bobby kind of hits the nail on the head here.

575
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:16,800
Bobby says, I think September is when we'll get that.

576
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:20,680
So people resubscribe because people bought their Nintendo online for a year.

577
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:24,080
Now in September, Nintendo is going to be tasked with, now we need you to renew for

578
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:25,080
another year.

579
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:29,400
So I think any big announcements and things along the line of other freebies like Tetris

580
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:35,320
99, and there's the, I think, which I would bet with the success of Tetris 99, Nintendo's

581
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:38,360
got to be looking at and going, what else can we put?

582
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:42,960
What if I says 100 and that, okay, here's here, you ready?

583
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:46,640
You're ready for my pie in the sky dreamboat thing that Nintendo, I really want them to

584
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:52,840
do an NES remix, super multiplayer about it.

585
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:53,840
I like a new one.

586
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:54,920
Think about it.

587
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:55,920
Super NES remix.

588
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:56,920
Yeah.

589
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:58,920
Maybe, maybe to go with it anyway.

590
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:02,040
Um, let's see, uh, what else did I want to mention?

591
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:05,400
There was, I thought there was one other thing from the, Oh yes, the one other huge game

592
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,760
none of us talked about.

593
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:09,460
We talked about the link, uh, breath of the wild sequel.

594
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:13,320
We did not talk about all that they showed with the links awakening remake.

595
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:14,320
That's coming out.

596
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:15,320
It's pretty interesting.

597
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:16,320
I love the art style.

598
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:21,640
And I love that they added that little, I don't want to call it a Mario maker mode,

599
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:25,840
but they definitely added like the customizable dungeon, which, you know, doesn't seem like

600
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:30,600
it's Oh my God, like all this customizability, but it's enough to kind of make you go, Oh,

601
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:31,600
that's neat.

602
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,560
You know, like, Oh, that's an additional, that's something new, you know, something

603
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:35,200
to add to the table to remake.

604
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,720
And I thought that was really cool.

605
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,240
I mean, I'm going to pick this game up.

606
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:39,240
Hello.

607
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:44,820
I like these, like 2.5 Z Zelda's are like, or 2.5 D Zelda's are like my favorite.

608
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:46,380
So I'm going to definitely pick it up.

609
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:47,740
I mean, no question.

610
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:48,740
And Mario maker too.

611
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:49,740
Hello.

612
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:50,740
I'm buying it.

613
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:51,740
Of course.

614
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:52,740
Yeah, of course.

615
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:53,740
But I'm glad they didn't spend a lot of time on that.

616
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:57,700
The one I thought they spent maybe a little too much time on was, um, the dragon quest

617
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:58,700
builders too.

618
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:02,700
Cause we kind of knew that was coming and you know, we already kind of know and we just

619
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:04,460
saw it previously at screening.

620
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:08,080
The one good thing though, that did come out of that whole, uh, tree house thing is they

621
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:11,020
did walk back their decision on multiplayer.

622
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:13,040
Oh, good call.

623
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:14,040
They did.

624
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:18,360
They're going to allow, you know, you'd be able to play with friends online as well in

625
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:19,600
unranked matches.

626
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:23,320
So that's going to be coming after launch, but it is something that's coming.

627
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:24,320
Yeah.

628
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:25,320
All right.

629
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:29,200
And then we had a little more information on Pokemon sword and shield as well, but a

630
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:32,840
lot of that during the direct, when they were showing them a lot of that, uh, I'm sorry,

631
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:37,600
the tree house, when they were showing some of that, like the, um, I can't poke ball plus

632
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,600
none.

633
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:40,560
Well, yeah, there's that, but I'm thinking what the, Oh my God.

634
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:43,880
Now I can't remember the name and I already hear Shane screaming at me somewhere at the

635
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:45,360
little Corgi with a heart on its butt.

636
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:46,360
Yeah.

637
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:47,360
What was the name?

638
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:48,360
The cute thing.

639
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:49,360
Yeah.

640
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:50,360
Oh my God.

641
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:51,360
That thing was so adorable.

642
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:52,360
Yipper.

643
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:53,360
Yapper.

644
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:54,360
Something like that.

645
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:55,360
Adorable.

646
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:56,360
So that was cool.

647
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:58,080
But I know there's a little controversy going on with Pokemon as well, but stay tuned.

648
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,120
We're going to address that a little bit later in the show.

649
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:01,120
So yeah.

650
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:02,120
All right.

651
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:03,120
Um, so Yamper, thank you.

652
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:04,120
Act.

653
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:05,120
I knew somebody in chat.

654
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,120
We know Yamper.

655
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:07,120
I was clear.

656
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,120
Yelper.

657
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:09,120
Old Yeller.

658
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,120
Old Yelper.

659
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:11,120
All right.

660
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:12,360
Uh, yeah.

661
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:14,480
And SSG100 Matt points out the sheep Pokemon.

662
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,480
Yeah.

663
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:16,480
The Wooloo.

664
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:17,480
That looked really cute too.

665
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:22,280
Although, you know, we've already had sheep Pokemon, so we had a Mareep, poor Mareep rest

666
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:23,280
in peace.

667
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:24,280
All right.

668
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:25,280
Anyway.

669
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:26,280
Uh, let's move on.

670
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:27,280
There were other conferences as well.

671
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:28,280
Right.

672
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:30,720
Uh, the night before we had Square Enix's event.

673
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:31,720
Yeah.

674
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:36,360
So just quickly, I want to say, um, Bobby and I did that thing we mentioned last week.

675
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:37,600
We did our, Oh, you were watching.

676
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:38,600
I was watching.

677
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:39,600
What'd you think?

678
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:40,600
I thought it was good.

679
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:45,240
So that's, it doesn't just have to be me and Bobby to someday me and you can do it someday.

680
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:46,560
You and her can do it.

681
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:50,720
You know, we can, we, we have the technology to be able to do those impromptu shows.

682
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:51,720
I was surprised.

683
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:57,840
Our chatters seem to be really into it because what I tried to do is I tried to not be cynical

684
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:59,120
about it.

685
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:03,140
And I think that goes a long way with people because too many times we look at live streams

686
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:07,800
and there's, there's people going like, Oh, this sucks or this is trash or this is garbage

687
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:12,200
or let's take the camera into the bathroom and like all these like trashy things.

688
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:13,200
Right.

689
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:19,920
So I, well, we did, sorry if I join in, you know, something positive.

690
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:20,920
It's not going to be positive.

691
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:24,080
I'm going to have, you know what, I'm only going to allow you on a stream like that.

692
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:28,380
If I get a little, what the buzzer that comes with the board game taboo.

693
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:34,360
And every time you negative, I get to go, that poor battery is going to be burnt to

694
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:35,360
Chris.

695
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,360
What do you guys think?

696
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:46,200
We're going to hit the buzzer and the batteries are drained by the end of the night.

697
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:51,040
Oh yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

698
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:53,040
And Oh, and no from Bobby.

699
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:56,320
Well, so far yeses are in the lead.

700
00:29:56,320 --> 00:30:00,400
Bobby's going to need that for anytime Rob calls into a show because you never know.

701
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:04,200
You know, I dropped the F bomb on the Bobby Blackwell show tonight when he tries to keep

702
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:06,040
his show very clean.

703
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:07,040
And I made a booboo.

704
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:10,680
I slipped up because it was after six o'clock and like the gremlins, you don't feed them

705
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:12,960
after midnight or they might drop an F bomb.

706
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:13,960
All right.

707
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:15,960
Anyway, let's, let's talk about the Square Enix thing.

708
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:16,960
Actually, let me ask dark Sakura.

709
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:19,520
I don't know if you saw, I know you were busy with work and stuff.

710
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:22,400
Did you see any of the stuff out of the Square Enix event?

711
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:24,280
The Avengers thing is pretty interesting.

712
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:30,520
It looks nothing like them, but I was really into final fantasy seven really into it.

713
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:31,520
Yeah.

714
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:32,520
Doesn't the remake look good?

715
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:36,040
Honestly though, I don't like Barrett's voice.

716
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:41,960
I mean, it just, it sounds like it's trying to be a tough voice, but it sounds like it's

717
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:43,240
trying to be a tough voice.

718
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:44,240
You know what I mean?

719
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:45,680
But Tifa and Cloud sound great.

720
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:46,680
Okay.

721
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:50,840
But if, if we're talking about seven and the remake and getting to see things in HD, how

722
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:54,040
are your feelings about Aerith?

723
00:30:54,040 --> 00:31:02,480
I still hate her, but did you notice how much it seemed to focus on Cloud and Tifa?

724
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:05,360
Why did they change?

725
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:06,360
What happens?

726
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:09,600
Oh, no, she has to die.

727
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,280
Oh, no, no, no.

728
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:12,280
You forget.

729
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:14,080
She actually has to die for the plot.

730
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,560
You need to take that thought out of the universe.

731
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:18,560
I want you to pick up that thought and take it out of the universe.

732
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:21,360
You throw that thought away in the garbage disposal.

733
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:22,360
The Resurrector.

734
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:26,360
It's just J-100 Matt says, buzz him now.

735
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:27,360
Too late.

736
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:28,360
All right.

737
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:29,360
Anyway, sorry, dark Sakura.

738
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:32,640
One other thing I did notice dark Sakura was that they did, for what it's worth, they did

739
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:38,440
call her Aerith in the English language version, so they must not be changing your name this

740
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:39,440
time.

741
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:40,440
Well, honestly, that's how it should be.

742
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:41,440
Right.

743
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:43,560
But Sephiroth sounded a little weird.

744
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:45,320
I didn't like Sephiroth either.

745
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:48,840
That was probably my biggest criticism too, but the gameplay like, seriously, it's like

746
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:53,080
they took Final Fantasy 15's engine, which we all knew that's what was happening, right?

747
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:54,080
And they made it better.

748
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:57,840
Like, they really like, oh man, I, that's the one thing I really wish I could have gone

749
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:01,640
to LA and played was that, but you know, my friends that are down, that were down there

750
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:04,720
and got their hands on it say, this is, this is great.

751
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:10,960
It's just, it's weird to me that this is basically Final Fantasy 16.

752
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:13,880
And if, and if Delvin was here right now, he'd be telling me, I've been telling you

753
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:14,920
that.

754
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:18,840
And I don't think they're, they're not going to call it like 16, 17 and 18 because call

755
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:20,320
it Final Fantasy 16.

756
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:25,580
But basically the reason why we haven't seen a Final Fantasy 16 is because this is it.

757
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:27,580
They're putting everything into this.

758
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:32,460
That would have been going into a Final Fantasy 16, including, yeah, multiple, like a Final

759
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:38,580
Fantasy 16, 16, two and 16, three clearly, because as we heard, the first episode is

760
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:42,600
nothing but Midgar and it's two Blu-rays.

761
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:46,460
So clearly they are going to expand on the story crazy.

762
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:47,960
They have to be.

763
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:53,180
And so my poor bandwidth cap and I, I can't, oh man, fuck you for putting that thought

764
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:57,540
out there because now I'm like, what if they do change major plot points?

765
00:32:57,540 --> 00:32:58,540
Like what if they do too?

766
00:32:58,540 --> 00:32:59,540
I don't think they changed that one.

767
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:04,520
I think that one is like, oh my God, there would be protests outside of Square Enix headquarters

768
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:10,780
led by her, but I'd be out there with my sign.

769
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:11,780
Yeah.

770
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:13,780
Let me put more evil into the universe.

771
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:16,220
What if there's multiple endings?

772
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:22,740
One you get the killer and one she's stays around and lives the, actually I don't hate

773
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:23,860
you as much for that.

774
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:25,920
It's not the whole killer and lives thing.

775
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:31,020
The multiple ending thing though, we have to address Final Fantasy seven's kind of crappy

776
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:32,020
ending.

777
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:33,520
That is going to have to be addressed in the remake.

778
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:37,200
And I do fully expect, you know, it's, we're about 10 years from finding out what it's

779
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,980
going to be by the time we get there.

780
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:44,840
But I expect them to address the ending of Final Fantasy and multiple endings.

781
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:45,840
Why not?

782
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:50,580
Why not a good ending where you see the red 13, who by the way was very much absent from

783
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:51,580
that preview.

784
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:56,360
What if we see the red 30, you know, you guys, I'm, I'm talking about a game from the nineties,

785
00:33:56,360 --> 00:34:00,480
so I hope it's not spoilers at this point, but if you watch during the credits, you see

786
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:06,200
red 13 run out into, and see a Midgar where the life is back and the plants I've grown

787
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:07,200
around it.

788
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,160
And that is like, kind of like the true ending in many ways.

789
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:12,800
And that was the best part of the ending in my opinion, um, cause the rest of it didn't

790
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:16,480
make a lot of God damn sense, but, um, maybe there may be something like that would be

791
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:17,480
expanded on.

792
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:19,360
You see more if you get the good ending.

793
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:24,140
I just hope that they incorporate, um, some of the, uh, Advent children's stuff because

794
00:34:24,140 --> 00:34:25,580
that movie is bad-ass.

795
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:29,380
I just hope they let you skip the fucking summon animations finally.

796
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:30,380
Knights of the round.

797
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:31,380
No, no, no, no.

798
00:34:31,380 --> 00:34:37,740
I want to be able to pick and choose to skip like, because if I need to go to the bathroom

799
00:34:37,740 --> 00:34:42,020
during the end of the game, I want to be able to do some Knights of the round, Quadra magic

800
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:43,820
and mimic or whatever.

801
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:48,700
So I can go have a decent pee break and come back and have it still finishing.

802
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:52,880
I have made a sandwich during the process of that entire thing.

803
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:57,020
Akuma JP putting his thoughts on the ending out in our chat room at twitch.tv slash vog

804
00:34:57,020 --> 00:35:00,640
network saying, no, no, that was to show red is not extinct.

805
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:01,720
He got kids.

806
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:02,720
That is true.

807
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:06,680
You could see his child in that little sequence to children has been a long time in that sequence

808
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:07,680
too.

809
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:10,680
So, I mean, there's many, many conclusions and many things you can draw out of the ending.

810
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:11,680
That's for sure.

811
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:16,320
As children under Matt says one Blu-ray disc is just the data for the summons.

812
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:17,400
Here's hoping.

813
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:23,100
Here's hoping I that Shiva animation better scream gay pride.

814
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:24,100
Yes.

815
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:27,060
I wish you could see the face Jamie just made.

816
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:28,060
That's uh huh.

817
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:29,060
Yeah.

818
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:32,100
Cause like when Shiva comes out and snaps her fingers, I want to be left shooketh.

819
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:33,100
Hold on.

820
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:36,100
Can you see me?

821
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:37,100
Yes.

822
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:40,260
That that's the face she made.

823
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:41,940
Even even Loki is kind of smart.

824
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:42,940
Yep.

825
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:47,220
When she, when she comes out and does her thing, I want it to be like, I just like,

826
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:55,240
I, and, and lady Gaga appears on a giant Mac and every, like, it's just, and there's

827
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:56,240
a parade.

828
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:57,240
Yes.

829
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:58,240
That's what I want.

830
00:35:58,240 --> 00:35:59,240
And there's a parade.

831
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:05,820
I can just picture that actually see like, you know, look, look, you can have all the

832
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:06,820
other summons.

833
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:07,820
Okay.

834
00:36:07,820 --> 00:36:08,820
Okay.

835
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:12,720
Straight people can have Knights of the round and E free and whatever black, but we get

836
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:13,880
the diva.

837
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:14,880
Let me have Shiva.

838
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:17,300
Let my people have Shiva.

839
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:18,300
Okay.

840
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:19,300
Anyway.

841
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:25,460
And Shiva, by the way, drag queen, wasn't 13 that Shiva was on a motor or was Shiva

842
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:27,460
sisters on the motorbikes.

843
00:36:27,460 --> 00:36:28,460
Yes.

844
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:29,460
Yeah.

845
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:30,460
Yeah.

846
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:31,460
All right.

847
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:41,300
Anyway, tell us about some other things we saw at the square enix event, Loki, uh, final

848
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:44,440
fancy crystal Chronicles remastered edition.

849
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:45,440
Yeah.

850
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:49,840
I it's, it's kind of interesting to see that like, um, without the game boy advance and

851
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:52,240
the, the complicated setup that that required.

852
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:54,000
Um, but I'm, I'm kinda into it.

853
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,720
I'd like to check out that game again.

854
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:59,560
Last remnants being remastered as well, which is okay.

855
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:02,480
And we kind of knew that was happening cause the other one got delisted.

856
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:03,480
Yeah.

857
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:06,360
Uh, dragon quest builders two looked okay.

858
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:10,880
The first game is a lot of fun and it looks like they really amped up what you could do

859
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:13,020
creatively in the second one.

860
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:15,060
I'm definitely interested in the second one.

861
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:17,300
I just feel like there's so many other games to play.

862
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:20,980
I feel like it's one of those games that's going to get lost in the shuffle, but I, I

863
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:22,940
feel like I owe it to myself to check it out at least.

864
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:24,380
Cause the first game is a lot of fun.

865
00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:27,260
I, I didn't beat it, but I played a lot of it.

866
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:29,900
Is it part of the Xbox game passing?

867
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:32,900
So maybe we should talk about that real quick.

868
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:33,900
Actually a little tan.

869
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:34,900
You ready for a tangent?

870
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:38,460
I do not believe it's part of the Xbox game pass, but we did talk about Microsoft last

871
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:39,460
week.

872
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:40,460
Right?

873
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:43,960
Um, you know, cause I wouldn't have, because I didn't do it till my new Tuesday.

874
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:47,040
I bought the Xbox Xbox game pass ultimate.

875
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:53,600
Um, I, they, they had a great deal where just for a dollar, you can upgrade your existing

876
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:58,640
go for, I don't know how long it goes for, but see, Bobby did the smarter thing.

877
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:02,240
I didn't, I didn't realize, I thought it was just a dollar for the first month and that's

878
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,240
all I was getting.

879
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:04,240
And I was okay with that.

880
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:06,000
I was prepared to pay the 15 a month or whatever.

881
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:10,360
And I, I saw some chart that talked about converting gold time to, so I didn't think

882
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:13,460
it was going to be one for one, but I paid the dollar and it's like, okay.

883
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:16,480
So is that dollar per month or is it a dollar a dollar?

884
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:20,500
And then it said your next billing date, March, 2020, because that's when my current Xbox

885
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:21,500
live was set to expire.

886
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:25,060
And I was like, Oh my God, I could have padded that out like with a cart.

887
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:26,980
And that's exactly what Bobby Black Wolf did.

888
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:30,620
He went and he pad, I guess it won't let you pad it out more than three years.

889
00:38:30,620 --> 00:38:35,060
So don't buy too much Xbox live, but you go buy like, just buy like a two year card, pad

890
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:38,540
out your Xbox live, then pay the dollar to upgrade and you're going to be happy.

891
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:43,480
But you know your results may vary, read the fine print, make sure that promotion is still

892
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:47,440
going because I'm sure as Microsoft realizes more and more people are figuring this out,

893
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:49,640
they're going to pull the plug on that.

894
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:53,700
But I just, yeah, but anyway, I mean, I was fully prepared to pay the 15 a month after

895
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:56,760
this month and I would have done it.

896
00:38:56,760 --> 00:39:00,360
And yeah, I, so, so when I get to my gaming week, I'll talk about some of the games I've

897
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:02,240
been able to play as a result of that.

898
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:07,560
But yeah, I think that's worth noting is that Microsoft did convince me to get on this game

899
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:11,820
pass ultimate thing because it's kind of what I was hoping for from Stadia that I didn't

900
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:12,820
get.

901
00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:14,820
So I'm going to put my stock in the Microsoft thing.

902
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:18,780
Yeah, I think Microsoft's getting a lot right for the future, so we'll see.

903
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:22,660
I'm so curious to see how Sony responds to it next year.

904
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:23,660
We'll see.

905
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:24,660
Anyway, sorry.

906
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:25,660
Back to Squeenix.

907
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:34,500
They showed off a Dragon Quest 11 Echoes or S Echoes of an Elusive Age.

908
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:38,560
Yes, the Definitive Edition where now I'm kind of pissed off I bought the first version

909
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:41,300
because this other one seems like it has so much more.

910
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:48,400
You can flip between the classic Dragon Quest and it has the redone music, which the original

911
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:51,000
game badly needed, let me tell you, and so on.

912
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:55,240
So I'm kind of mad that I'm probably going to buy this again.

913
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:56,240
Let's see.

914
00:39:56,240 --> 00:40:01,520
They showed off the expansion for Final Fantasy 14 a little bit, Shadowbringers.

915
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:02,520
That was cool.

916
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:03,520
Don't get me wrong.

917
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:09,380
Final Fantasy 14, but I feel like they spent a lot of time on that when it's like literally

918
00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:13,540
out in like less than three weeks.

919
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:19,260
Romancing Saga 3 and Scarlet Grace.

920
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:22,660
Also they showed off a little bit of gameplay for Dying Light 2, which has been a while

921
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:25,740
since they've shown that.

922
00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:28,460
War of Visions, Final Fantasy Brave Exvius.

923
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:32,180
Oh yeah, that was the tactical spinoff of the mobile game.

924
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:33,180
Yeah.

925
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:40,240
It is not the same as Final Fantasy Tactics, so I'm not interested in playing it on mobile

926
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:41,240
at the end of the day.

927
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:44,920
There's a game called Outriders by the people that did Bulletstorm.

928
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:50,160
Oh yeah, that looked like an Eidos type of thing when Square purchased that.

929
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:53,920
So yeah, that looked alright for people that are into that.

930
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:56,040
Final Fantasy VIII remaster.

931
00:40:56,040 --> 00:41:00,300
I think a lot of people excited about the VIII remaster, so you're probably wondering

932
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:07,720
because I'm somewhat known and disliked sometimes for saying that Final Fantasy VIII is my least

933
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:10,960
favorite in the entire franchise.

934
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:15,560
However I'm very happy for the fans of Final Fantasy VIII that they get this remaster.

935
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:18,800
As long as it's not as fucking grindy.

936
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:20,760
Well that's the thing is that, here's the thing.

937
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:24,320
My problem with Final Fantasy VIII was never the story or the characters.

938
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:28,100
I actually think all of that is great and would have made for an amazing movie if Final

939
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:30,000
Fantasy had gone that direction.

940
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:34,660
It's the drawing magic, the junctioning magic, and that whole system is just broken.

941
00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:40,820
And having that system in a game where you can't outlevel the monsters as well, it doesn't

942
00:41:40,820 --> 00:41:42,640
work for me at all.

943
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:47,180
And so I'm kind of like, I don't see how a remaster is going to fix that for me.

944
00:41:47,180 --> 00:41:51,920
But granted the PC version had that change where you could just instantly draw a 99 to

945
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:55,300
1 spell, you know, so you kind of cheat a little bit through the game.

946
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:56,300
So I don't know, I'm undecided.

947
00:41:56,600 --> 00:42:02,660
It kind of depends what price they put it out for, but for the sake of the fans that

948
00:42:02,660 --> 00:42:06,620
always tell me I'm being unfair when it comes to Final Fantasy VIII, I'm willing to give

949
00:42:06,620 --> 00:42:08,240
this a shot.

950
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:10,240
So to be continued.

951
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:14,740
And the one I was looking forward to was Marvel's Avengers, which they showed off some gameplay

952
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:17,640
for that, but I don't know.

953
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:22,400
The gameplay didn't look all that exciting and I'm a little put off by the way the characters

954
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:23,400
look.

955
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:24,660
I know I get it.

956
00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:26,600
It's not supposed to be the cinematic universe.

957
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:31,000
I'm fine with that because we've had, you know, other designs in other games that have

958
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,000
been fine.

959
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:36,080
But something's just really kind of weird looking at it, but they have like a really

960
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:37,400
good voice cast for it.

961
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:39,160
So I'll be willing to give it a shot.

962
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:44,200
Just like if I have to look at Marvel's Avengers versus like Marvel Ultimate Alliance, I'm

963
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:47,720
kind of leaning a little bit more towards Marvel Ultimate Alliance 3.

964
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:49,120
The Ultimate Alliance games have always been good.

965
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:51,600
Yeah, we didn't even bring that up in Nintendo's event.

966
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:53,320
They showed Marvel Ultimate Alliance 3.

967
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:54,320
Hello.

968
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:56,320
Well, I guess we talked about that before.

969
00:42:56,320 --> 00:43:00,080
But still to see it in action, hear about the DLC, see just how many characters are

970
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:01,080
in it.

971
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:02,080
That was pretty cool.

972
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:03,080
Yeah.

973
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:04,080
So I don't know.

974
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:07,560
I mean, I'll check it out, but it's just the premise doesn't have me like, Oh my God, I

975
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:09,240
really need to play this.

976
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:10,240
Here's the thing.

977
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:11,240
It's I didn't dislike it.

978
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:13,480
In fact, as it was going, I was like, OK, this is pretty neat.

979
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:14,480
Like I'm into it.

980
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:22,560
But I fully realize they can't have the the characters in the Avengers look like the movie

981
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:23,560
side.

982
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:24,560
Yeah, I'm fine with that.

983
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:29,720
And they spent a lot of time trying to justify that it was a different universe and it's

984
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:31,080
not the characters you're used to.

985
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:35,400
In fact, I kind of feel like they spent too much time trying to justify it because there

986
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:38,560
was that whole sequence where they had like Troy Baker and Nolan North and the other voice

987
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:42,840
actors sit down and they're like, yeah, Bruce Banner, he's kind of like this character that

988
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:43,840
da da da.

989
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:48,440
And it's like, OK, as much as I love these voice actors, as talented as they are, I don't

990
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:52,840
need to hear them recite characters we already know to me, because I think the reason why

991
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:58,040
they did that is they were really trying to show it's these versions of the characters.

992
00:43:58,040 --> 00:44:00,440
We have a separate version of these characters.

993
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:04,280
What I would have preferred to see is just let the game do the talking.

994
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:07,580
Yeah, let the game do the talking, because then when they came out on stage and they

995
00:44:07,580 --> 00:44:10,880
started to talk more about, oh, it's going to be like there's going to be co-op and it's

996
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:14,000
going to be a persistent experience and you're going to have these generated quests that

997
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,000
you can do.

998
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,120
I was like, I would like to know more.

999
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:18,120
Are you going to show me?

1000
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:19,120
No.

1001
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:20,120
Oh, OK.

1002
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:21,120
And you're not.

1003
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:22,120
OK, fine.

1004
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:26,080
So I'll just have to wait and see when they it comes closer to coming out, which is next

1005
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:27,080
May.

1006
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:31,240
So, I don't know, just right now, it's just I'm not that excited about it.

1007
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:36,300
I was really looking forward to it when it was coming out, but I don't know.

1008
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:37,300
It's fine.

1009
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:38,300
Yeah.

1010
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:39,300
So the movie has some comments.

1011
00:44:39,300 --> 00:44:41,300
There's some really good comments in chat.

1012
00:44:41,300 --> 00:44:44,220
Kaijuto in chat just flat out says Avengers looks like trash.

1013
00:44:44,220 --> 00:44:48,180
I just want a sandbox superhero or Marvel game.

1014
00:44:48,180 --> 00:44:52,220
Mistake Theory says the six Tomb Raider games they made were just so good.

1015
00:44:52,220 --> 00:44:56,360
I can't help but think they had to have brought some of that greatness over to the Avengers.

1016
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:57,760
And I'm kind of with you there, too.

1017
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:01,200
Like I'm I'm not going to write this game off yet.

1018
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:05,460
I'm just kind of like my reaction to this whole thing was cool story.

1019
00:45:05,460 --> 00:45:08,060
Can't wait to see the game.

1020
00:45:09,060 --> 00:45:10,060
And then I'll make some decisions.

1021
00:45:10,060 --> 00:45:11,060
Yeah.

1022
00:45:11,060 --> 00:45:12,060
I mean, it's we've got lots of time.

1023
00:45:12,060 --> 00:45:13,060
You didn't see enough.

1024
00:45:13,060 --> 00:45:16,100
S.J.A. 100 Matt in chat says I don't hate the designs at all.

1025
00:45:16,100 --> 00:45:19,940
And I understood from the get go that this was not going to be MCU related.

1026
00:45:19,940 --> 00:45:23,860
But I think when you combine gamers and comic fans both hate everything.

1027
00:45:23,860 --> 00:45:28,660
And the fact that Endgame is so fresh in everyone's mind that folks are upset.

1028
00:45:28,660 --> 00:45:31,940
People will get over the designs when the game comes out and it's good.

1029
00:45:31,940 --> 00:45:32,940
And that's yeah.

1030
00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:33,940
Let the game do the talking.

1031
00:45:33,940 --> 00:45:37,140
If the game is really good, let the game do the talking because I feel like a lot of that

1032
00:45:37,220 --> 00:45:41,380
was just justifying this isn't the Avengers you're used to.

1033
00:45:41,380 --> 00:45:43,680
It's going to be our version and our version.

1034
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:49,820
Super cool because we got Nolan North and and OK, I'm sure it's let the game do the

1035
00:45:49,820 --> 00:45:50,820
talking.

1036
00:45:50,820 --> 00:45:55,460
You know, you could you could have you could have who I'm trying to think of like really

1037
00:45:55,460 --> 00:45:59,460
terrible voice actors that you could have Lance Bass, Gilbert Gottfried, Mandy Moore.

1038
00:45:59,460 --> 00:46:06,700
You could have Gilbert Gottfried voicing Black Widow and if the game is really good, it won't

1039
00:46:07,260 --> 00:46:08,260
matter.

1040
00:46:08,260 --> 00:46:09,260
You know what I mean?

1041
00:46:09,260 --> 00:46:11,700
So that's that's all I'm saying.

1042
00:46:11,700 --> 00:46:15,140
And no, just no disrespect to those fine, talented voice actors.

1043
00:46:15,140 --> 00:46:18,060
They were doing a good job at doing what they were asked to do.

1044
00:46:18,060 --> 00:46:22,260
I just wish that Square had taken a different approach to how they announced and unveiled

1045
00:46:22,260 --> 00:46:23,260
that.

1046
00:46:23,260 --> 00:46:26,380
SSG 100 Matt suggests Danny DeVito as Hulk.

1047
00:46:26,380 --> 00:46:27,380
Danny DeVito is everything.

1048
00:46:27,380 --> 00:46:28,380
Come on.

1049
00:46:28,380 --> 00:46:29,380
Come on.

1050
00:46:29,380 --> 00:46:30,380
Yes.

1051
00:46:30,380 --> 00:46:31,380
All right.

1052
00:46:31,380 --> 00:46:32,380
What else is Square Enix?

1053
00:46:32,380 --> 00:46:33,380
That was it.

1054
00:46:33,380 --> 00:46:34,380
That was it.

1055
00:46:34,380 --> 00:46:35,380
All right.

1056
00:46:35,380 --> 00:46:36,380
Well, then let's move on.

1057
00:46:37,060 --> 00:46:38,060
What did Ubisoft talk about?

1058
00:46:38,060 --> 00:46:41,180
I didn't watch this whole thing because there's a lot of the games I just really don't care

1059
00:46:41,180 --> 00:46:42,180
about.

1060
00:46:42,180 --> 00:46:43,900
But I didn't see any of it because I was working.

1061
00:46:43,900 --> 00:46:46,980
So I did check out a bit of it.

1062
00:46:46,980 --> 00:46:50,100
So I watched the Watchdog Legion stuff, which looks pretty neat.

1063
00:46:50,100 --> 00:46:54,220
So that the kind of the hook with Watchdog Legion, it's going to take place in London

1064
00:46:54,220 --> 00:46:59,660
and you can recruit a bunch of different characters, pretty much anybody in the world.

1065
00:46:59,660 --> 00:47:04,660
So you'll be able to, you know, they were showing this grandma who is like an assassin

1066
00:47:04,700 --> 00:47:09,740
type person and a bunch of other, you know, hacker types that you could get.

1067
00:47:09,740 --> 00:47:13,700
And, you know, one guy might be, you know, an expert at drones or something.

1068
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:18,420
And so you you do research on them and then you can recruit them in or they can get killed.

1069
00:47:18,420 --> 00:47:23,620
And it's it's really neat that you have like this big crew that you kind of work together

1070
00:47:23,620 --> 00:47:27,100
on taking back London.

1071
00:47:27,100 --> 00:47:28,540
So that's coming out March.

1072
00:47:28,540 --> 00:47:33,940
I did like that they're kind of like evolving the series as opposed to like the same old

1073
00:47:34,020 --> 00:47:36,660
type of formula in a new city or something like that.

1074
00:47:36,660 --> 00:47:39,660
Yeah, I like that. They're like, well, how can we make this a little different?

1075
00:47:39,660 --> 00:47:43,500
Oh, hack the planet. Literally, you know, that would be something different.

1076
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:45,740
Yeah, it looks like it does look interesting.

1077
00:47:45,740 --> 00:47:47,940
So I do want to play it.

1078
00:47:47,940 --> 00:47:49,980
Hopefully I will finish this one.

1079
00:47:49,980 --> 00:47:51,340
I haven't played the first one.

1080
00:47:51,340 --> 00:47:56,700
I have it and I haven't finished the second one.

1081
00:47:56,700 --> 00:47:59,460
Ubisoft will honestly probably give the first one away.

1082
00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:03,380
Maybe even the second one when this one's about to come out just to try to build.

1083
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:06,020
Yeah, probably PlayStation Plus is that a lot.

1084
00:48:06,020 --> 00:48:07,860
But I've yeah, I've still got this somewhere.

1085
00:48:07,860 --> 00:48:09,300
I've like not played it at all.

1086
00:48:09,300 --> 00:48:11,300
But the second one's a great game.

1087
00:48:11,300 --> 00:48:13,140
So I will have to get around to it.

1088
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:17,060
Nifty 805 says, can I take back London as Kylie Minow?

1089
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:22,260
Hey, maybe, maybe, you know, they can't use the Spice Girls, but I bet you they could

1090
00:48:22,260 --> 00:48:28,300
have a pop superstar group that you could possess and take over with your dance moves.

1091
00:48:28,300 --> 00:48:30,300
Let's put another girl through her paces.

1092
00:48:30,300 --> 00:48:35,940
Yeah, that sounds pretty wrong when you say it like that.

1093
00:48:35,940 --> 00:48:38,260
That's quoting something like Spice World.

1094
00:48:38,260 --> 00:48:44,100
It's like that's like something a pimp would say, you know, anyway.

1095
00:48:44,100 --> 00:48:50,020
So because everybody has to have their own service subscription service, Ubisoft has

1096
00:48:50,020 --> 00:48:58,520
you play plus, which you can subscribe to for about 15 dollars a month.

1097
00:48:58,520 --> 00:49:00,800
And it's going to be a PC only service.

1098
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:06,480
And they're going to have, I guess, early access that's going to free access before

1099
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:11,280
if you sign up before August 15th, you'll get free access from the 3rd of September

1100
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:13,820
to the end of September.

1101
00:49:13,820 --> 00:49:21,120
And then they have access to over 100 PC games early and beta access to new launch titles.

1102
00:49:21,120 --> 00:49:25,840
And also with DLC and expansions being included with that, too.

1103
00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:27,640
Well, there's room for everybody.

1104
00:49:27,640 --> 00:49:33,400
How about we just say that that was kind of how I felt and I'm worried because when

1105
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:40,280
it comes to the the game subscription service thing, everybody wants to do their version

1106
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:44,580
of it now because they saw what happened with movies, how Netflix and somewhat Hulu really

1107
00:49:44,580 --> 00:49:46,700
got to dominate the conversation early on.

1108
00:49:46,700 --> 00:49:51,760
And now everybody likes CBS, like even Disney Plus, to an extent, has to catch up, although

1109
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:54,320
we all know Disney Plus is not going to have a problem catching up.

1110
00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:58,160
But, you know, we have to see all these other now didn't see an answer going to do their

1111
00:49:58,160 --> 00:49:59,160
own thing now, too.

1112
00:49:59,160 --> 00:50:00,160
I don't know.

1113
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:01,160
But but this is only PC.

1114
00:50:01,160 --> 00:50:06,120
So I'm kind of fine with that because Ubisoft games are part of like the Xbox Game Pass

1115
00:50:06,120 --> 00:50:07,120
stuff.

1116
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:09,580
So it's kind of OK.

1117
00:50:09,580 --> 00:50:15,080
Then they've got Rainbow Six Quarantine, which is going to be a new co-op game with zombies.

1118
00:50:15,080 --> 00:50:16,080
Hooray.

1119
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:19,740
That's coming out in 2020.

1120
00:50:19,740 --> 00:50:24,560
They showed off some stuff for Assassin's Creed Odyssey, this new mode called Story

1121
00:50:24,560 --> 00:50:31,340
Creator Mode, which allow you to create your own quests and share them with other players.

1122
00:50:31,340 --> 00:50:32,340
So neat.

1123
00:50:32,340 --> 00:50:35,620
That's a way to kind of get more life out of the game when they're not doing another

1124
00:50:35,620 --> 00:50:36,700
Assassin's Creed this year.

1125
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:39,960
They're taking the year off, which is OK, honestly.

1126
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:42,740
It's OK to not do one every single year.

1127
00:50:42,740 --> 00:50:45,920
They showed off a Ghost Recon Breakpoint.

1128
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:50,480
So that's going to have a new beta that's going to be along with the game win pre-orders

1129
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:53,520
and they're going to kick off in those games or money.

1130
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:54,520
Yep.

1131
00:50:54,520 --> 00:50:56,520
September 5th.

1132
00:50:56,520 --> 00:51:04,820
And then apparently there's going to be Tom Clancy's elite squad, which is a mobile game.

1133
00:51:04,820 --> 00:51:08,760
They're doing a Division movie on Netflix.

1134
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:12,660
And then this is something that's kind of interesting, Roller Champions, which is a

1135
00:51:12,660 --> 00:51:17,660
brand new free to play multiplayer game.

1136
00:51:17,660 --> 00:51:23,100
It's a kind of roller derby or like a cross between rugby and roller derby.

1137
00:51:23,100 --> 00:51:24,540
Yeah, it looked pretty cool.

1138
00:51:24,540 --> 00:51:29,360
I'll give a quick shout out actually to one of our listeners, Dark Tetsuya, who actually

1139
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:33,340
had submitted a YouTube of him playing this for a potential midpoint break for tonight's

1140
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:34,340
show.

1141
00:51:34,340 --> 00:51:38,240
One of the reasons I couldn't use it was because it has a lot of copyright music in it.

1142
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:41,420
And I was worried it was a little loud in his video and I was like, we might get Twitch

1143
00:51:41,420 --> 00:51:45,940
muted if I use this, but I think he put it up on YouTube and Dark Tetsuya, you can feel

1144
00:51:45,940 --> 00:51:49,420
free to link it here now, but you should check out his gameplay video if you're curious for

1145
00:51:49,420 --> 00:51:50,420
more on that.

1146
00:51:50,420 --> 00:51:51,980
Cause I'm kind of curious to check this out.

1147
00:51:51,980 --> 00:51:54,660
I like the roller blade type of games.

1148
00:51:54,660 --> 00:52:00,020
And then other gaming stuff, they also had Gods and Monsters, which kind of looks like

1149
00:52:00,020 --> 00:52:04,540
it's like a Zelda type game, but with Greek mythology.

1150
00:52:04,540 --> 00:52:06,540
And so that's kind of neat.

1151
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:08,780
Yeah, that looked cool.

1152
00:52:08,780 --> 00:52:13,100
They also had a new mode and customization for For Honor.

1153
00:52:13,100 --> 00:52:17,340
So it's this mode called Soul Rush.

1154
00:52:17,340 --> 00:52:25,820
And they also shot off yet another TV series, Mythic Quest Ravens Banquet, which is being

1155
00:52:25,820 --> 00:52:30,060
done by the folks behind It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia.

1156
00:52:30,060 --> 00:52:38,740
So it's about, I don't know if he's going to be in it, but, how was it, Rob McElney

1157
00:52:38,780 --> 00:52:44,900
He basically, him, Charlie Day, and they say Megan Ganz.

1158
00:52:44,900 --> 00:52:47,960
So I know him and Charlie Day are in It's Always Sunny.

1159
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:53,780
It's supposed to be about a game development studio and just kind of the stuff that goes

1160
00:52:53,780 --> 00:52:54,780
on there.

1161
00:52:54,780 --> 00:52:58,700
And so basically he plays this guy named Grim.

1162
00:52:58,700 --> 00:53:02,500
Can you imagine, and it's always, oh my God, this actually, now I'm like more hyped about

1163
00:53:02,500 --> 00:53:03,500
this than when I first heard it.

1164
00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:08,020
So here's the thing though, it's only on Apple's TV plus service or whatever they've got.

1165
00:53:08,020 --> 00:53:10,260
They're like stupid subscription service.

1166
00:53:10,260 --> 00:53:12,740
Just well, just like I'm going to probably get it.

1167
00:53:12,740 --> 00:53:16,140
Just like I said, everybody's got their own subscription service now and it's making it

1168
00:53:16,140 --> 00:53:17,860
difficult as a consumer.

1169
00:53:17,860 --> 00:53:20,120
Well, that isn't just an Apple problem.

1170
00:53:20,120 --> 00:53:21,260
It's an NBC problem.

1171
00:53:21,260 --> 00:53:23,460
It's a CBS all access problem.

1172
00:53:23,460 --> 00:53:27,780
It's everybody wants a piece of the pie and of course, doing it because it is another

1173
00:53:27,780 --> 00:53:28,780
year.

1174
00:53:28,780 --> 00:53:34,100
So you have another year of Just Dance, Just Dance 2020 also coming to the Wii.

1175
00:53:34,100 --> 00:53:37,180
I think people made way too big of a deal out of the fact that it's still coming out

1176
00:53:37,180 --> 00:53:38,180
to the Wii.

1177
00:53:38,180 --> 00:53:39,180
Who cares?

1178
00:53:39,180 --> 00:53:40,180
Let's be real.

1179
00:53:40,180 --> 00:53:41,180
It's not that complicated.

1180
00:53:41,180 --> 00:53:44,140
And everybody, by the way, did you notice how people were saying, oh, I guess none for

1181
00:53:44,140 --> 00:53:45,820
the Wii U, huh?

1182
00:53:45,820 --> 00:53:49,180
The Wii U plays Wii games by releasing it for the Wii.

1183
00:53:49,180 --> 00:53:53,800
They are in fact releasing it for the Wii U, food for thought, but it doesn't matter.

1184
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:57,100
You guys said, you guys that are going to the extent to listen to a podcast about video

1185
00:53:57,100 --> 00:53:59,380
games, we're never going to buy this game on the Wii anyway.

1186
00:53:59,380 --> 00:54:00,380
You're buying it on whatever.

1187
00:54:00,380 --> 00:54:04,900
Well, I shouldn't say that maybe, but you're going to buy it on whatever other current

1188
00:54:04,900 --> 00:54:07,260
platform you're gaming on or PC probably.

1189
00:54:07,260 --> 00:54:08,340
Or Stadia.

1190
00:54:08,340 --> 00:54:14,060
The Wii is for those multitude of retirement homes and community centers that still use

1191
00:54:14,060 --> 00:54:16,700
these games a lot to get people up and moving.

1192
00:54:16,700 --> 00:54:21,340
Like don't underestimate the casuals when it comes to Just Dance.

1193
00:54:21,340 --> 00:54:24,340
Don't underestimate the power of the casuals.

1194
00:54:24,340 --> 00:54:25,340
That's right.

1195
00:54:25,340 --> 00:54:26,700
Don't underestimate the power of the casual.

1196
00:54:26,700 --> 00:54:28,820
So that's it.

1197
00:54:28,820 --> 00:54:32,500
You didn't mention, somebody in chat mentioned it, but when you talked about like shows,

1198
00:54:32,500 --> 00:54:34,180
you didn't mention the Division movie.

1199
00:54:34,180 --> 00:54:35,180
I did mention it.

1200
00:54:35,180 --> 00:54:36,180
That was, I mentioned that first.

1201
00:54:36,180 --> 00:54:37,180
Oh, I guess I just blacked out.

1202
00:54:37,180 --> 00:54:38,180
Yes.

1203
00:54:38,180 --> 00:54:39,180
They're getting a movie.

1204
00:54:39,180 --> 00:54:40,180
My bad.

1205
00:54:40,180 --> 00:54:41,180
Yeah.

1206
00:54:41,180 --> 00:54:42,180
Coming to Netflix.

1207
00:54:42,180 --> 00:54:43,180
Okay.

1208
00:54:43,180 --> 00:54:44,180
All right.

1209
00:54:44,180 --> 00:54:45,180
So yes, there's, and what?

1210
00:54:45,180 --> 00:54:46,180
Jake Gyllenhaal and who was in it?

1211
00:54:46,180 --> 00:54:48,620
The redhead, Jessica Chastain, right?

1212
00:54:48,620 --> 00:54:54,500
I don't know, but that sounds interesting more so than the TV show, but I do want to

1213
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:57,220
see the TV show because I like It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia.

1214
00:54:57,220 --> 00:54:59,220
Ooh, great.

1215
00:54:59,220 --> 00:55:03,580
Comment on Just Dance by Questbuster in our chat room saying the Wii is also used in a

1216
00:55:03,580 --> 00:55:07,460
hospitals as a rehab option for some patients like kids.

1217
00:55:07,460 --> 00:55:11,740
Well, that, that'll make you feel like garbage for making fun of the fact that game's coming

1218
00:55:11,740 --> 00:55:12,740
out for the Wii.

1219
00:55:12,740 --> 00:55:13,740
Yeah.

1220
00:55:13,740 --> 00:55:14,740
You're making fun of sick kids now.

1221
00:55:14,740 --> 00:55:15,740
Yeah.

1222
00:55:15,740 --> 00:55:16,740
Piece of trash.

1223
00:55:16,740 --> 00:55:17,740
Think twice before you tweet.

1224
00:55:17,740 --> 00:55:18,740
Anyway.

1225
00:55:18,740 --> 00:55:19,740
No, but in all seriousness.

1226
00:55:19,740 --> 00:55:23,980
I mean, aren't the kids sick enough and you're now you're making them played like a decade

1227
00:55:23,980 --> 00:55:24,980
old console.

1228
00:55:24,980 --> 00:55:25,980
I mean, come on.

1229
00:55:25,980 --> 00:55:30,440
In all seriousness, it is very cool that, you know, if they're able to put the game

1230
00:55:30,440 --> 00:55:35,040
on the Wii, hey, they're still supporting it because there is situations like that.

1231
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:40,320
And maybe they're not the majority of cases, but you know, it's, they wouldn't put it on

1232
00:55:40,320 --> 00:55:42,160
that console if it wasn't selling.

1233
00:55:42,160 --> 00:55:43,160
Exactly.

1234
00:55:43,160 --> 00:55:44,160
Exactly that.

1235
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:48,800
So, and mistake theory also points out it's also still carried in libraries.

1236
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:52,560
A lot of libraries still only have Wii games and no other consoles.

1237
00:55:52,560 --> 00:55:57,040
I don't know if this joke is wrong or not, but I, I, I love a good pun.

1238
00:55:57,040 --> 00:55:59,280
So Sia Tabiri says, we have.

1239
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:00,280
Why not?

1240
00:56:00,280 --> 00:56:01,280
Why not?

1241
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:02,280
That's what works for me.

1242
00:56:02,280 --> 00:56:03,280
That works for me.

1243
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:04,280
I love a good pun.

1244
00:56:04,280 --> 00:56:05,280
Why not?

1245
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:09,280
I love a good pun when I was saying them the other week.

1246
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:11,280
Well, cause yours aren't good.

1247
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:12,280
All right.

1248
00:56:12,280 --> 00:56:13,280
Moving on.

1249
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:15,200
Uh, your favorite event, every E3, right?

1250
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:16,600
Loki, the PC gaming show.

1251
00:56:16,600 --> 00:56:17,600
Oh yes.

1252
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:18,920
It's so, so amazing.

1253
00:56:18,920 --> 00:56:24,360
I don't really give a shit, but, um, we can just really quickly go over some of the stuff

1254
00:56:24,360 --> 00:56:25,360
that they did talk about.

1255
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:30,160
Uh, some of the titles that they showed off, age of wonders, planet fall.

1256
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:33,400
Uh, I don't know what the hell that's about.

1257
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:37,000
Auto chess has nothing to do with cars.

1258
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:40,240
Maybe instead they, they, they announced a lot of games.

1259
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:42,760
Maybe we just want to touch on some of the highlights.

1260
00:56:42,760 --> 00:56:43,760
I am.

1261
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:44,760
Chivalry 2.

1262
00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:45,760
That's pretty cool.

1263
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:46,760
Yeah.

1264
00:56:46,760 --> 00:56:47,760
Chivalry is a pretty good game.

1265
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:54,520
Uh, Chris Tails looks interesting.

1266
00:56:54,520 --> 00:56:59,600
This is supposed to kind of go along like a big time travel aspect.

1267
00:56:59,600 --> 00:57:00,600
So that looks interesting.

1268
00:57:00,600 --> 00:57:01,600
Yeah.

1269
00:57:01,600 --> 00:57:04,280
These, these time travel and time loop types of games are all the rage.

1270
00:57:04,280 --> 00:57:09,080
I know you weren't here last week and I doubt you watched the Microsoft thing very carefully,

1271
00:57:09,080 --> 00:57:13,920
but there was a really cool looking narrative game by Annapurna, um, that I was a big fan

1272
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:15,780
of called 12 minutes.

1273
00:57:15,780 --> 00:57:19,400
That's about like a time loop type of situation and it looked, I would, I would really urge

1274
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:22,640
you to look at the trailer for that game cause it looked really cool and I think you'd be

1275
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:23,640
into it.

1276
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:27,160
I, it's probably a multi-platform, probably not just Microsoft.

1277
00:57:27,160 --> 00:57:28,160
Yeah.

1278
00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:30,440
Um, they showed off more footage for Last Oasis.

1279
00:57:30,440 --> 00:57:36,920
That's the one about, um, I remember it's something that has to do with like a plan

1280
00:57:36,920 --> 00:57:42,220
of being un, um, you can't inhabit it because it's just basically too hot.

1281
00:57:42,220 --> 00:57:47,680
And so there's only this strip down the middle that basically they can survive on and they've

1282
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:49,400
got these rolling wood machines and stuff.

1283
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:50,400
It looks pretty awesome.

1284
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:52,760
So that's, that's something they showed off.

1285
00:57:52,920 --> 00:57:55,560
Um, Midnight Ghost Hunt.

1286
00:57:55,560 --> 00:57:56,920
That one looks pretty cool.

1287
00:57:56,920 --> 00:57:59,520
And so basically you have to hunt ghosts.

1288
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:00,520
You don't say?

1289
00:58:00,520 --> 00:58:01,520
Yes.

1290
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:05,360
Um, but I remember correctly, there was one I saw, I don't know if it's the same, maybe

1291
00:58:05,360 --> 00:58:08,480
it was a different, uh, indie game that was ghost hunting, but there was one I saw that

1292
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:12,400
was like four against one and you get the, as the ghost, you actually get the possess

1293
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:15,440
object and throw them at other players and knock them down and stuff.

1294
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:17,880
It's kind of like prop hunt, but a little different.

1295
00:58:17,880 --> 00:58:21,640
Um, Hey, real quick question from Frodo Swagons in our chat and maybe, maybe you have the

1296
00:58:21,640 --> 00:58:22,640
answer to this Loki.

1297
00:58:22,680 --> 00:58:25,760
So, but can someone explain to me what that auto chess game is?

1298
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:28,680
I keep seeing advertisements for it everywhere, but I don't see any good feedback and I must

1299
00:58:28,680 --> 00:58:31,680
admit I'm not up and up on the auto chess myself.

1300
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:34,280
Did you, did you catch a little more on what that's all about?

1301
00:58:34,280 --> 00:58:35,880
No, no idea.

1302
00:58:35,880 --> 00:58:40,480
It's a, they said it's a part of one of the Epic store games that they're going to have.

1303
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:48,560
And it's, um, I mean, honestly it looks like just this really fancy chess game.

1304
00:58:48,560 --> 00:58:53,280
I guess it looks like it's, I don't know, like battle chess.

1305
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:54,280
Okay.

1306
00:58:54,280 --> 00:58:57,280
So I'm looking up some more info online just so we can get familiar with it.

1307
00:58:57,280 --> 00:59:00,440
And, and where, where sometimes the hosts fail, the listeners are there to save the

1308
00:59:00,440 --> 00:59:01,440
day as well.

1309
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:04,640
And I'll get some, you have to understand that, you know, your question is outweighing

1310
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:06,080
my interest in the games.

1311
00:59:06,080 --> 00:59:07,360
Well, here's what it's all about.

1312
00:59:07,360 --> 00:59:12,680
So there's a mod for Dota called Dota auto chess, and you can do eight players that play

1313
00:59:12,680 --> 00:59:18,240
a modified version of chess, but it uses characters and gameplay elements from Dota two.

1314
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:21,600
And apparently this is really popular in Dota, which is probably why I missed it.

1315
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:25,840
Cause I've played probably like 95% heroes of the storm, 5% league of legends.

1316
00:59:25,840 --> 00:59:28,560
I just don't really play any Dota anymore.

1317
00:59:28,560 --> 00:59:30,280
But maybe I should be, I don't know.

1318
00:59:30,280 --> 00:59:35,360
But apparently now this is so, so, and this is really funny because Dota exists, Dota

1319
00:59:35,360 --> 00:59:38,880
two exists because it was Warcraft three mod spun off.

1320
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:39,880
Now we have Dota.

1321
00:59:39,880 --> 00:59:42,360
So now this auto chess mod is so popular.

1322
00:59:42,360 --> 00:59:44,680
It's spinning off into its own game, auto chess.

1323
00:59:44,680 --> 00:59:46,020
That's what's happening here.

1324
00:59:46,020 --> 00:59:51,100
So, uh, and then, uh, our listeners here, quest buster says, uh, one note on auto chess.

1325
00:59:51,100 --> 00:59:54,780
Apparently it's also responsible for pushing valve to make Dota underlords and riot games

1326
00:59:54,780 --> 00:59:56,620
do the same auto chess light game.

1327
00:59:56,620 --> 00:59:58,380
I had no idea what it was either.

1328
00:59:58,380 --> 00:59:59,580
It sounds like a MOBA.

1329
00:59:59,580 --> 01:00:02,960
You create teams from a pool of characters, then set them to auto battle.

1330
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:05,800
But unlike a MOBA, you don't control everything during a fight.

1331
01:00:05,800 --> 01:00:10,340
You pretty much just let the teams go at it and hope your strategic picks win the day.

1332
01:00:10,340 --> 01:00:11,940
Interesting.

1333
01:00:11,940 --> 01:00:15,980
So it's like tabs, but with Dota characters.

1334
01:00:16,020 --> 01:00:19,900
Well, here's the thing, if you want to know more about it, Dota two is a free game.

1335
01:00:19,900 --> 01:00:23,140
You know, they make their money off selling the heroes and that other stuff.

1336
01:00:23,140 --> 01:00:25,180
So, um, go check it out.

1337
01:00:25,180 --> 01:00:29,800
You have the ability to check out this mod and, uh, it'll, it'll help planet zoo.

1338
01:00:29,800 --> 01:00:33,540
It's a new game from the folks that did planet coaster, except now you're creating a zoo.

1339
01:00:33,540 --> 01:00:34,540
Oh yeah.

1340
01:00:34,540 --> 01:00:35,540
That look cute.

1341
01:00:35,540 --> 01:00:40,980
Why can't you just create both in one, you know, like a Marine world or animal kingdom

1342
01:00:40,980 --> 01:00:45,180
hippopotamus on a roller coaster, it's like have animals over here and your roller coasters

1343
01:00:45,180 --> 01:00:46,180
have it both.

1344
01:00:46,180 --> 01:00:50,980
You know, I guess we can't mix games, you know, I did see the zoo game that looked pretty

1345
01:00:50,980 --> 01:00:51,980
awesome.

1346
01:00:51,980 --> 01:00:58,940
Uh, Shenmue three, this game, I telling Liza looks kind of back it up, back it up.

1347
01:00:58,940 --> 01:01:02,780
You what you, you zip past the Shenmue three thing, like the biggest thing that everybody's

1348
01:01:02,780 --> 01:01:04,780
talking about from this conference was the Shenmue three thing.

1349
01:01:04,780 --> 01:01:07,340
Do you know what she said about Shenmue three?

1350
01:01:07,340 --> 01:01:11,660
What they say about it is going to be exclusive to the Epic game store for 12 months.

1351
01:01:11,660 --> 01:01:12,660
That's right.

1352
01:01:12,660 --> 01:01:17,440
So even if you did a Kickstarter backing for the game, well, that'll teach you with the

1353
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:21,360
understanding that you would be getting a steam copy as they were advertising on Kickstarter

1354
01:01:21,360 --> 01:01:25,620
at the time, you're going to be getting it for the Epic store instead.

1355
01:01:25,620 --> 01:01:26,620
Lucky you.

1356
01:01:26,620 --> 01:01:27,620
Yeah.

1357
01:01:27,620 --> 01:01:28,820
So this has a lot of people not happy.

1358
01:01:28,820 --> 01:01:32,860
I wonder if it's going to escalate to a point, uh, with Kickstarter.

1359
01:01:32,860 --> 01:01:33,860
I don't know.

1360
01:01:33,860 --> 01:01:35,300
It's it's see, here's the thing.

1361
01:01:35,300 --> 01:01:41,420
I don't have as much of a like resistance against the Epic store.

1362
01:01:41,420 --> 01:01:43,780
I use Epic and I use steam.

1363
01:01:43,780 --> 01:01:45,540
I use a few others too.

1364
01:01:45,540 --> 01:01:50,440
Um, so for me, I'm not so bothered, but I also understand that if a person doesn't want

1365
01:01:50,440 --> 01:01:52,740
to have an Epic account, they have every right not to have one.

1366
01:01:52,740 --> 01:01:53,920
Actually, I should say this.

1367
01:01:53,920 --> 01:01:54,920
You know what?

1368
01:01:54,920 --> 01:01:55,920
I will say this.

1369
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:57,660
I believe my Epic account was hacked.

1370
01:01:57,660 --> 01:02:01,860
Um, I'm getting all these friend requests from people I don't fricking know.

1371
01:02:01,860 --> 01:02:06,460
And they connected my PlayStation or they connected the account to a PlayStation account.

1372
01:02:06,460 --> 01:02:07,900
I'd never heard of.

1373
01:02:07,900 --> 01:02:09,180
And so I had to unconnect it.

1374
01:02:09,180 --> 01:02:12,580
And now the fricking Epic store won't let me reconnect it with my right account.

1375
01:02:12,580 --> 01:02:16,140
In fact, I should check on my ticket because I sent a help ticket to try to get that fixed.

1376
01:02:16,140 --> 01:02:19,500
But I was like, did somebody get into my Epic account?

1377
01:02:19,500 --> 01:02:23,820
Because I may have used the same password I use somewhere else and the other, you know

1378
01:02:23,820 --> 01:02:27,500
how that happens when one of those sites gets hacked and all the, the, they try to use those

1379
01:02:27,500 --> 01:02:31,260
username passwords other places, and it probably works for somebody on my Epic store thing.

1380
01:02:31,260 --> 01:02:35,100
I have since changed the password on Epic store and I believe if they have to factor

1381
01:02:35,100 --> 01:02:36,940
off, I turned it on as well, which I think they do.

1382
01:02:36,940 --> 01:02:37,940
So I turned that on.

1383
01:02:38,180 --> 01:02:41,460
Really, like I've just been trying to turn on two factor off, like everywhere I can.

1384
01:02:42,260 --> 01:02:46,660
Because I get emails all the time, all the time on my Microsoft account.

1385
01:02:47,380 --> 01:02:50,340
Someone keeps trying to get into my fricking Microsoft account.

1386
01:02:50,340 --> 01:02:52,180
Thank God I have two factor off.

1387
01:02:52,180 --> 01:02:52,820
Anyway.

1388
01:02:52,820 --> 01:02:54,660
So anyway, uh, sorry tangent.

1389
01:02:54,660 --> 01:02:57,860
But, um, it just goes to show that like, you know, if somebody doesn't want to have an

1390
01:02:57,860 --> 01:03:00,820
Epic store account, I can't say I blame them at this juncture.

1391
01:03:02,340 --> 01:03:04,500
Uh, Terraria's Journey's End.

1392
01:03:04,500 --> 01:03:05,700
It's a brand new expansion.

1393
01:03:05,700 --> 01:03:07,780
They said that has a ton of content in it.

1394
01:03:07,780 --> 01:03:10,580
So that looks, I'm, I was unaware.

1395
01:03:10,580 --> 01:03:12,900
They're still at, you know, adding expansions to that.

1396
01:03:12,900 --> 01:03:13,700
So that's pretty cool.

1397
01:03:14,740 --> 01:03:20,340
Um, Valfaris looks pretty cool.

1398
01:03:20,340 --> 01:03:22,660
It's a run and gun game similar to Contra.

1399
01:03:23,460 --> 01:03:26,420
And then of course, uh, Vampire the Masquerade Bloodlines 2.

1400
01:03:26,420 --> 01:03:27,700
They showed another trailer for that.

1401
01:03:27,700 --> 01:03:28,900
It looked interesting.

1402
01:03:28,900 --> 01:03:31,620
It looks pretty good actually, but I didn't like first person.

1403
01:03:32,500 --> 01:03:35,220
If they give you like a character view, I would be down for it.

1404
01:03:36,100 --> 01:03:38,580
Uh, they have an expansion for Warframe coming out.

1405
01:03:38,580 --> 01:03:45,860
Uh, I think it's Emprene and let's see what else.

1406
01:03:45,860 --> 01:03:47,780
Zombie Army for Dead War.

1407
01:03:48,660 --> 01:03:51,860
That sounds very generic and has zombies.

1408
01:03:52,900 --> 01:03:54,260
It looks like they have Zombie Hitler.

1409
01:03:55,140 --> 01:03:55,780
Of course they do.

1410
01:03:56,900 --> 01:04:00,340
Just a quick, I was, I was looking at my phone cause I wanted to see if Epic had responded

1411
01:04:00,340 --> 01:04:03,220
to the ticket I sent them and no response yet, but to be fair, it's the weekend.

1412
01:04:03,220 --> 01:04:04,980
So we'll give them, we'll see what happens tomorrow.

1413
01:04:05,940 --> 01:04:07,060
So that's all.

1414
01:04:07,060 --> 01:04:07,620
All right.

1415
01:04:07,620 --> 01:04:08,900
So the PC gaming show.

1416
01:04:08,900 --> 01:04:14,820
No, probably the only big like thud was the whole Shenmue 3 thing, but I don't know if

1417
01:04:14,820 --> 01:04:16,260
there was a lot of like what had people...

1418
01:04:16,260 --> 01:04:21,460
There was another game just recently that was a Kickstarter that, that was also an issue too.

1419
01:04:22,180 --> 01:04:24,820
I don't remember which game, what it was now, but there was another one.

1420
01:04:24,820 --> 01:04:26,260
It was also a Kickstarter game.

1421
01:04:26,260 --> 01:04:27,220
It wasn't Bloodstained.

1422
01:04:27,220 --> 01:04:28,180
It wasn't Bloodstained.

1423
01:04:28,180 --> 01:04:31,860
It was, um, it may have been a smaller title.

1424
01:04:31,860 --> 01:04:35,540
I don't remember, but I know we just talked about something very similar.

1425
01:04:36,500 --> 01:04:41,620
And it's just it, I understand it's the allure of getting more money, you know, for, you

1426
01:04:41,620 --> 01:04:47,140
have a larger margin there, but, um, the same time, you know, maybe you pick that for your

1427
01:04:47,140 --> 01:04:48,580
next game and not this one.

1428
01:04:48,580 --> 01:04:53,620
I don't know, but maybe it shouldn't back.

1429
01:04:54,820 --> 01:05:01,140
You know, it's it, no, it is making the desire to back Kickstarters harder and harder.

1430
01:05:01,140 --> 01:05:06,820
And I don't know if some of these companies realize how much they're like shitting in

1431
01:05:06,820 --> 01:05:09,780
the tank to screw it up for everybody else.

1432
01:05:09,780 --> 01:05:10,420
You know what I mean?

1433
01:05:10,980 --> 01:05:12,820
Like just, it's unfortunate.

1434
01:05:12,820 --> 01:05:13,700
It's really unfortunate.

1435
01:05:14,900 --> 01:05:15,380
All right.

1436
01:05:15,380 --> 01:05:15,940
All right.

1437
01:05:15,940 --> 01:05:17,380
So that's it for the PC gaming event.

1438
01:05:17,380 --> 01:05:23,140
So, um, now I did not realize Konami was doing a thing this year because I remember the year

1439
01:05:23,140 --> 01:05:26,100
that Konami had that clusterfuck of a press conference.

1440
01:05:26,100 --> 01:05:26,900
Oh yes.

1441
01:05:26,900 --> 01:05:28,580
That just all the lols.

1442
01:05:28,580 --> 01:05:31,540
That was the year they announced 99 nights too.

1443
01:05:31,540 --> 01:05:34,180
And the guy was like, applause, applause.

1444
01:05:34,820 --> 01:05:36,260
Nobody was applauding.

1445
01:05:36,260 --> 01:05:36,820
It's great.

1446
01:05:36,820 --> 01:05:38,180
Go look it up on YouTube.

1447
01:05:38,180 --> 01:05:39,620
What year was that?

1448
01:05:39,620 --> 01:05:40,900
We were at E3 that year.

1449
01:05:40,900 --> 01:05:43,140
We just, that was a rock revolution year too.

1450
01:05:43,780 --> 01:05:47,940
Uh, I thought that was the year they showed off, uh, dance, the dance connect.

1451
01:05:47,940 --> 01:05:48,180
Yeah.

1452
01:05:48,180 --> 01:05:52,180
Dance evolution and, uh, rock revolution were coming out the same year.

1453
01:05:52,180 --> 01:05:52,500
God.

1454
01:05:52,500 --> 01:05:53,300
What year was that?

1455
01:05:53,860 --> 01:05:55,540
2010 says orange, right?

1456
01:05:55,540 --> 01:05:55,940
Seriously.

1457
01:05:55,940 --> 01:05:58,500
Y'all go look up the YouTube Konami press conference 2010.

1458
01:06:00,100 --> 01:06:00,740
Oh my God.

1459
01:06:00,740 --> 01:06:02,100
The lols anyway.

1460
01:06:02,100 --> 01:06:04,500
Uh, but Konami did something a lot different this year.

1461
01:06:04,500 --> 01:06:05,300
It wasn't funny.

1462
01:06:05,300 --> 01:06:06,900
It was just one big announcement, right?

1463
01:06:07,700 --> 01:06:08,020
Yeah.

1464
01:06:08,020 --> 01:06:16,100
So they talked, um, since they, they own, um, you know, Hudson soft, um, they basically

1465
01:06:16,100 --> 01:06:22,500
announced that a turbo graphics 16 mini, uh, PC engine core graphics mini and PC engine

1466
01:06:22,500 --> 01:06:24,580
mini were going to be coming out.

1467
01:06:24,580 --> 01:06:25,460
I'm getting them both.

1468
01:06:26,260 --> 01:06:28,980
And so of course those are the three different consoles.

1469
01:06:28,980 --> 01:06:30,340
We're in a different region.

1470
01:06:30,340 --> 01:06:30,820
Hold up.

1471
01:06:30,820 --> 01:06:34,260
I'm surprised to hear this from you dark soccer, because usually you're the type that

1472
01:06:34,260 --> 01:06:36,260
says, ah, I already own it.

1473
01:06:37,060 --> 01:06:38,340
Well, I do.

1474
01:06:38,340 --> 01:06:44,820
However, um, each of them come with different games and they're, I don't think I have

1475
01:06:44,820 --> 01:06:51,940
superstar soldier and I would like to play a version of, uh, uh, Jacula X, um, where

1476
01:06:51,940 --> 01:06:53,620
I don't have to use my desk.

1477
01:06:54,500 --> 01:06:55,620
You know, keep it preserved.

1478
01:06:55,620 --> 01:06:57,220
And I've been like, ah, it's not worth it.

1479
01:06:57,220 --> 01:06:57,780
It's not worth it.

1480
01:06:57,780 --> 01:06:58,740
It's not worth it.

1481
01:06:58,740 --> 01:07:02,500
But the additional superstar soldier is kind of a big one for me.

1482
01:07:02,500 --> 01:07:07,300
And we are going to get the, um, the turbo graphics mini because it's got some good

1483
01:07:07,300 --> 01:07:07,700
stuff on it.

1484
01:07:07,700 --> 01:07:10,500
I mean, East book one and two, we've got the CDs for those.

1485
01:07:10,500 --> 01:07:18,340
I mean, we're talking about, um, uh, uh, we've talked about CD games on these two.

1486
01:07:18,900 --> 01:07:23,860
Um, and also I'd like to play our type without, cause our type for a PC engine is really

1487
01:07:23,860 --> 01:07:24,180
good.

1488
01:07:24,180 --> 01:07:27,460
I was tired of switching out hue cards cause they were too hue cards.

1489
01:07:27,460 --> 01:07:29,380
So it'd be nice to have it all as one game.

1490
01:07:29,380 --> 01:07:34,100
Like, and I think it's going to be like the, the, uh, CD version because the CD version

1491
01:07:34,100 --> 01:07:34,740
was one.

1492
01:07:34,740 --> 01:07:39,540
So, so they've got basically your usual features that we go to the mini console.

1493
01:07:39,540 --> 01:07:43,620
So quick saving, they've got the different display modes, emulates CRT TVs and stuff

1494
01:07:43,620 --> 01:07:44,340
like that.

1495
01:07:44,580 --> 01:07:47,460
What's kind of neat is they're going to have a multi-tap, um, support.

1496
01:07:47,460 --> 01:07:50,260
So you can, it will support up to five players.

1497
01:07:50,260 --> 01:07:54,820
Um, but you have to buy a multi-tap separately.

1498
01:07:54,820 --> 01:08:00,020
So, um, for the North American European regions, you're gonna be getting an alien crush,

1499
01:08:00,020 --> 01:08:05,780
dungeon explorer, new adventure Island, ninja spirit, our type ease book one and two, and

1500
01:08:05,780 --> 01:08:07,300
more titles to be announced later.

1501
01:08:07,300 --> 01:08:13,300
And then of course in Japan, Bonk, Castlevania, Rondo of blood, China warrior, dungeon explorer,

1502
01:08:13,300 --> 01:08:17,700
superstar soldier, ease book one and two, and more to be announced later on.

1503
01:08:17,700 --> 01:08:18,740
Why do they call it Castlevania?

1504
01:08:18,740 --> 01:08:19,620
It was Dracula X.

1505
01:08:20,980 --> 01:08:23,780
I mean, yeah, it's in the Castlevania series, but it was called Dracula X.

1506
01:08:23,780 --> 01:08:29,940
It could also be a Liberty on the part of the reporter who's trying to get people to

1507
01:08:29,940 --> 01:08:30,580
connect it.

1508
01:08:30,580 --> 01:08:38,500
But I guess, uh, well to that, um, it's, I think, well, let me see.

1509
01:08:38,500 --> 01:08:39,460
I'm just sure.

1510
01:08:39,460 --> 01:08:43,380
Well, even the, the SNES version they released in the U S was Dracula X.

1511
01:08:45,380 --> 01:08:46,020
That's right.

1512
01:08:46,020 --> 01:08:46,340
You're right.

1513
01:08:46,340 --> 01:08:48,180
There was a, I keep thinking of Castlevania five.

1514
01:08:48,180 --> 01:08:49,460
That was a different thing.

1515
01:08:49,460 --> 01:08:50,020
Yeah.

1516
01:08:50,020 --> 01:08:53,700
But, uh, and honestly enough though, I mean, I'm a little disappointed to see that they're

1517
01:08:53,700 --> 01:08:58,100
not bothering to translate it for the U S one since there's already a translation.

1518
01:08:59,300 --> 01:09:04,100
But, and now we know that old games will be translated when the time's right.

1519
01:09:04,100 --> 01:09:07,620
Like again, the trials of manna thing, go back to it's pretty amazing.

1520
01:09:07,620 --> 01:09:11,780
There was the Castlevania Chronicles, so it's already translated, but there is a rondo

1521
01:09:11,780 --> 01:09:14,500
of blood fan translation out too.

1522
01:09:14,500 --> 01:09:20,500
So with voice acting, well, I tried to get into their website, but it sucks ass because,

1523
01:09:20,500 --> 01:09:25,140
you know, they want you to enter your birth date and then it goes back to the same goddamn

1524
01:09:25,140 --> 01:09:25,620
page again.

1525
01:09:26,500 --> 01:09:27,060
Well, forget it.

1526
01:09:28,420 --> 01:09:28,820
All right.

1527
01:09:29,380 --> 01:09:34,820
So, um, I, it sounds like yet another mini console, but, uh, I, it sounds like there,

1528
01:09:34,820 --> 01:09:39,220
you know, especially with the games being a little more obscure for some hard to get

1529
01:09:39,220 --> 01:09:41,620
collectibles, we didn't get bonk over here though.

1530
01:09:42,260 --> 01:09:42,980
This is a little weird.

1531
01:09:43,620 --> 01:09:46,900
I mean, the, the game, I mean, I have, I have a feeling bunk because they said there's more

1532
01:09:46,900 --> 01:09:47,460
to be announced.

1533
01:09:47,460 --> 01:09:48,980
I think bonk is going to be among them.

1534
01:09:48,980 --> 01:09:49,140
Yeah.

1535
01:09:49,140 --> 01:09:54,180
They probably just haven't announced everything yet, but, um, but I mean the games that are

1536
01:09:54,180 --> 01:09:58,260
on there, like I would expect for either one of these to eventually get like Lords of thunder

1537
01:09:59,140 --> 01:10:00,740
because that was a big one.

1538
01:10:00,740 --> 01:10:04,420
I don't see any, uh, Keith courage in the alpha zones, you know?

1539
01:10:04,420 --> 01:10:07,140
Cause that was, that was the pack-in wasn't it?

1540
01:10:07,140 --> 01:10:07,640
Yeah.

1541
01:10:08,020 --> 01:10:10,260
Um, I don't see anything.

1542
01:10:10,260 --> 01:10:11,620
What were some of the other big ones?

1543
01:10:11,620 --> 01:10:15,940
I would imagine though the Japanese one to be really shooter heavy cause the PC engine

1544
01:10:15,940 --> 01:10:22,260
was really shooter heavy, but like if it's, if it's Konami, why don't we get Gradius 2?

1545
01:10:23,060 --> 01:10:27,300
I expect to at least see that one on the Japanese, uh, version.

1546
01:10:27,300 --> 01:10:30,020
Cause you know, we didn't get Gradius 2 until it came out in a pack.

1547
01:10:31,700 --> 01:10:32,180
All right.

1548
01:10:32,180 --> 01:10:36,580
Well with that, that's pretty much the end of E3 the end.

1549
01:10:36,580 --> 01:10:39,700
Uh, but what'd you guys think overall this year of E3?

1550
01:10:39,700 --> 01:10:44,420
I mean, it was a kind of a weird year with Sony not being there and you know, us knowing

1551
01:10:44,420 --> 01:10:46,580
that we have new consoles next year.

1552
01:10:46,580 --> 01:10:49,620
I've kind of been saying it's a lame duck year, you know, when you know, it's kind of

1553
01:10:49,620 --> 01:10:51,620
like the last year of the current iteration.

1554
01:10:51,620 --> 01:10:53,540
I think it's still, I think it was still good.

1555
01:10:53,540 --> 01:10:58,580
We still have, you know, remember we still have more announcements coming with a games

1556
01:10:58,580 --> 01:11:01,300
com in like a month or so.

1557
01:11:01,300 --> 01:11:05,300
So I mean, I'm kind of okay that Sony wasn't there.

1558
01:11:05,300 --> 01:11:07,140
I still think there's good games that they announced.

1559
01:11:07,140 --> 01:11:09,700
There's stuff to look forward to towards the end of the year.

1560
01:11:09,700 --> 01:11:13,220
I'm glad it's not a million games coming out like in the fourth quarter.

1561
01:11:13,220 --> 01:11:15,380
So now it's a million games in March.

1562
01:11:15,380 --> 01:11:16,900
Well, it's, it's all over the place.

1563
01:11:16,900 --> 01:11:19,060
So I mean, I'm fine with that.

1564
01:11:19,060 --> 01:11:23,300
And March is right around, we get, you know, that's payday and tax return time.

1565
01:11:23,300 --> 01:11:24,740
So smart.

1566
01:11:25,540 --> 01:11:26,980
But I don't know.

1567
01:11:26,980 --> 01:11:29,940
I just, I, I'm fine with the way it is.

1568
01:11:29,940 --> 01:11:34,180
There wasn't anything like really shocking that came out of it.

1569
01:11:34,180 --> 01:11:36,980
I think it's just kind of run the course.

1570
01:11:36,980 --> 01:11:37,700
Yeah.

1571
01:11:37,700 --> 01:11:39,860
Um, act depth and chat says it was an average year.

1572
01:11:39,860 --> 01:11:40,580
It wasn't bad.

1573
01:11:40,580 --> 01:11:42,420
It was quite good, but not necessarily great.

1574
01:11:42,420 --> 01:11:42,660
Yeah.

1575
01:11:42,660 --> 01:11:44,100
I'm kind of on the same page with that.

1576
01:11:44,100 --> 01:11:47,300
I think there were a lot of like good games, like obviously March of next year is going

1577
01:11:47,300 --> 01:11:49,460
to be a very, very strong month for games.

1578
01:11:49,460 --> 01:11:51,940
Um, March is the new November, but that's okay.

1579
01:11:51,940 --> 01:11:54,580
I mean, there's still a lot of games to get excited about.

1580
01:11:54,580 --> 01:11:57,300
And that is really what it's all about at the end of the day.

1581
01:11:57,300 --> 01:12:01,540
So it'd be interesting once you get to March of next year to see how well Stadia is doing.

1582
01:12:01,540 --> 01:12:02,020
Yeah.

1583
01:12:02,020 --> 01:12:02,500
Yeah.

1584
01:12:02,500 --> 01:12:07,860
Uh, also March of next year, uh, excuse me, not March, but next E3, uh, in television

1585
01:12:07,860 --> 01:12:10,740
is anticipated to give a full stage conference.

1586
01:12:10,740 --> 01:12:12,660
Now, what did you think of the colors that they had?

1587
01:12:14,020 --> 01:12:15,060
Kind of bad-ass.

1588
01:12:15,060 --> 01:12:17,540
Like I, the one that looks like Tron is really cool.

1589
01:12:17,540 --> 01:12:20,740
The woodgrain one, like they're, they're very different, unique.

1590
01:12:20,740 --> 01:12:24,420
Like if that's what they really look like, like there's that part of me that just has

1591
01:12:24,420 --> 01:12:27,780
that reservation of, is it really going to be that good?

1592
01:12:27,780 --> 01:12:30,820
Like, or is it a lot of talk, you know?

1593
01:12:30,820 --> 01:12:33,060
So I just let's see the games.

1594
01:12:33,620 --> 01:12:35,220
Let's see it IRL.

1595
01:12:35,220 --> 01:12:37,060
I, but I'm cautiously optimistic.

1596
01:12:37,060 --> 01:12:38,100
I think is a good way to put it.

1597
01:12:38,100 --> 01:12:38,420
Yeah.

1598
01:12:38,420 --> 01:12:41,620
But let's see what some of these games look like because, uh, in television never did

1599
01:12:41,620 --> 01:12:42,660
put out publicly.

1600
01:12:43,220 --> 01:12:46,500
Uh, I mean, I guess it was there at E3 and people were getting their hands on it, but

1601
01:12:46,500 --> 01:12:49,460
for whatever reason, they're not putting out footage of the games yet.

1602
01:12:49,460 --> 01:12:53,620
Although I did check their Twitter earlier and I guess that is coming in July.

1603
01:12:53,620 --> 01:12:57,460
So they do plan to put out like another teaser that will have some of the early gameplay

1604
01:12:57,460 --> 01:12:58,020
footage.

1605
01:12:58,020 --> 01:13:01,540
And then next year at E3, they're going to have a full E3 press event.

1606
01:13:01,540 --> 01:13:02,660
So that'll be interesting.

1607
01:13:02,660 --> 01:13:08,100
I'm just kind of curious how that is going to change the dynamic potentially with the

1608
01:13:08,100 --> 01:13:10,180
family console coming into mix.

1609
01:13:10,180 --> 01:13:15,060
And then I hear that VCS console, the Atari one's still being redesigned again.

1610
01:13:16,260 --> 01:13:18,660
That it's kind of going back to the drawing board.

1611
01:13:18,660 --> 01:13:21,060
Atari needs to do something to grab my attention at this point.

1612
01:13:21,060 --> 01:13:23,060
Cause I done forgot that that was even a thing.

1613
01:13:23,060 --> 01:13:26,820
So it's, it's basically like a computer now, a computer box type thing.

1614
01:13:26,820 --> 01:13:27,380
Cool.

1615
01:13:27,380 --> 01:13:30,820
But I'm not really seeing why I need to pay attention to it right now.

1616
01:13:30,820 --> 01:13:30,980
Yeah.

1617
01:13:30,980 --> 01:13:32,740
That's my honest feedback for Atari.

1618
01:13:32,740 --> 01:13:34,420
So, all right.

1619
01:13:34,420 --> 01:13:37,780
Well, um, usually at the top of the show, it was a little bit of a special week cause

1620
01:13:37,780 --> 01:13:41,300
we were talking about E3 and everything that happened with E3 this week, but usually at

1621
01:13:41,300 --> 01:13:44,340
the top of the show, we like to talk about the types of video games that we've been playing

1622
01:13:44,340 --> 01:13:44,900
this week.

1623
01:13:44,900 --> 01:13:48,500
So let's talk about our gaming weeks and how was your gaming week and what types of

1624
01:13:48,500 --> 01:13:50,180
video games have you been playing this week?

1625
01:13:50,180 --> 01:13:51,860
Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?

1626
01:13:51,860 --> 01:13:58,020
Um, it was really just, you know, the usual for me, it was, uh, um, Animal Crossing

1627
01:13:58,020 --> 01:13:58,660
Pocket Camp.

1628
01:13:59,380 --> 01:14:07,540
And, um, I guess trying to clean up and get everything that I can in it before, you know,

1629
01:14:07,540 --> 01:14:08,900
I move on to something else.

1630
01:14:09,780 --> 01:14:14,500
Um, Dan and I have been watching this Zelda marathon that's trying to raise some money

1631
01:14:14,500 --> 01:14:15,300
for something.

1632
01:14:15,380 --> 01:14:19,780
They have a guy with a melodica and a guy with a accordion playing during some of those

1633
01:14:19,780 --> 01:14:21,860
and a couple of people singing is actually pretty cute.

1634
01:14:22,420 --> 01:14:26,500
Um, but, uh, when we, when we, when I left the, actually, when I left the house this

1635
01:14:26,500 --> 01:14:27,940
morning, they were on spirit tracks.

1636
01:14:27,940 --> 01:14:29,940
So it gave me a chance to check out a game I hadn't played.

1637
01:14:30,580 --> 01:14:33,700
Um, um, I'm still doing idle pouring.

1638
01:14:33,700 --> 01:14:35,220
I know I don't mention it anymore.

1639
01:14:35,220 --> 01:14:37,220
I'm still debating quitting it.

1640
01:14:37,220 --> 01:14:43,540
Um, Dan and I have been working on trying to get the setup done, but we're redoing our

1641
01:14:43,540 --> 01:14:43,860
office.

1642
01:14:44,740 --> 01:14:48,900
So, um, there hasn't really been a whole lot going on because we've been in the middle

1643
01:14:48,900 --> 01:14:52,900
of just reorganizing the house and then with all the pride events and everything, it's

1644
01:14:52,900 --> 01:14:56,420
been kind of taken precedence over any other type of gaming.

1645
01:14:56,420 --> 01:15:03,220
But I did, I did dig, uh, dig out, not ding out the, um, uh, steam link.

1646
01:15:03,780 --> 01:15:04,820
See if we can get that hooked up.

1647
01:15:06,180 --> 01:15:06,420
Cool.

1648
01:15:07,060 --> 01:15:07,540
Anything else?

1649
01:15:08,340 --> 01:15:08,820
Uh-uh.

1650
01:15:08,820 --> 01:15:09,380
All right.

1651
01:15:09,380 --> 01:15:10,100
We'll move on.

1652
01:15:10,100 --> 01:15:11,140
Yeah, we'll Pokemon go.

1653
01:15:11,940 --> 01:15:15,620
I guess a lot of people have been doing, I guess there are, uh, the shiny amount went

1654
01:15:15,620 --> 01:15:20,340
way up over this past couple of days because of Pokemon go Fest, which sadly I wasn't,

1655
01:15:20,340 --> 01:15:21,380
obviously none of us were there.

1656
01:15:21,380 --> 01:15:25,700
We would probably talked about it already, but, um, I heard it was a lot of fun for those

1657
01:15:25,700 --> 01:15:29,220
that went except, uh, Saturday, the day that got canceled.

1658
01:15:29,220 --> 01:15:33,700
Um, because weather, but I guess, uh, the, the trade-off is that if you had a ticket

1659
01:15:33,700 --> 01:15:39,540
for Saturday, then you next week, we'll see all of the Pokemon go Fest Pokemon on your

1660
01:15:39,540 --> 01:15:40,980
phone, wherever you're at.

1661
01:15:40,980 --> 01:15:45,060
So it's interesting that Niantic has that technology within the game.

1662
01:15:45,060 --> 01:15:48,260
It's almost like they could just not even do an event in Chicago.

1663
01:15:48,260 --> 01:15:52,340
They could just say, pay 10 bucks to attend the worldwide festival and you'll see the

1664
01:15:52,340 --> 01:15:54,180
Pokemon wherever you're at in the world.

1665
01:15:54,180 --> 01:15:55,540
Be kind of, I'm fine with that.

1666
01:15:55,540 --> 01:15:55,780
Yeah.

1667
01:15:55,780 --> 01:15:59,220
I don't know how I feel about the whole pay to win element of it, but it would be an

1668
01:15:59,220 --> 01:16:02,580
interesting, I sit here and talk, give the money to a charity.

1669
01:16:02,580 --> 01:16:06,580
Then it makes it, you know, actually, yes, it lessens it a lot if you do that.

1670
01:16:06,580 --> 01:16:07,860
But anyway, I digress.

1671
01:16:07,860 --> 01:16:08,900
Loki, how was your gaming week?

1672
01:16:08,900 --> 01:16:09,940
I didn't play anything.

1673
01:16:10,500 --> 01:16:11,140
Sorry.

1674
01:16:11,140 --> 01:16:11,780
No, I did.

1675
01:16:11,780 --> 01:16:14,100
Um, I played a little bit of Pokemon go.

1676
01:16:14,100 --> 01:16:19,780
I found that, um, cause I had submitted a portal for a location, but it hasn't been

1677
01:16:19,780 --> 01:16:21,540
denied or, um, accepted yet.

1678
01:16:21,540 --> 01:16:27,540
Cause I guess it takes several months limbo, but the right down from where I had requested

1679
01:16:27,540 --> 01:16:31,300
a portal, which I think is more of a landmark than what they picked.

1680
01:16:31,300 --> 01:16:35,060
They picked this stupid information kiosk and put that as a portal.

1681
01:16:35,060 --> 01:16:38,100
Now what are you going to do?

1682
01:16:38,100 --> 01:16:39,060
Stop new.

1683
01:16:39,060 --> 01:16:39,300
Yeah.

1684
01:16:39,300 --> 01:16:43,540
It's, it's right across, like literally within distance of the Starbucks is there.

1685
01:16:43,540 --> 01:16:48,420
But if they put that as one, then I think what I submitted should be good, but yeah,

1686
01:16:48,420 --> 01:16:49,300
no way it takes time.

1687
01:16:49,300 --> 01:16:49,700
It's fine.

1688
01:16:50,580 --> 01:16:56,420
Starbucks is, is that in the shopping center with the, um, uh, Vietnam Memorial?

1689
01:16:57,460 --> 01:17:04,180
Uh, no, it's the shopping center by my work where I take my kid.

1690
01:17:04,180 --> 01:17:04,660
Yes.

1691
01:17:04,660 --> 01:17:04,900
Okay.

1692
01:17:05,700 --> 01:17:11,940
We don't want to give away everything, but the one that I was mentioning is like an enemy

1693
01:17:11,940 --> 01:17:12,500
players.

1694
01:17:12,500 --> 01:17:17,700
They're, they're very clearly won it for some reason and they bump it a lot.

1695
01:17:17,700 --> 01:17:19,780
So anyway, that's why I was like, can I get a new portal there?

1696
01:17:19,780 --> 01:17:20,900
Cause that's a problem.

1697
01:17:20,900 --> 01:17:22,980
No, but there's new, there's new stores going in over there.

1698
01:17:22,980 --> 01:17:27,540
So they're, they may try to choose bargain anyway.

1699
01:17:27,540 --> 01:17:27,940
Yes.

1700
01:17:27,940 --> 01:17:32,420
Um, so I, but I did work on, uh, programming a little bit for a couple hours.

1701
01:17:32,420 --> 01:17:37,620
So I did that and I posted a, a funny little video on, on, uh, Twitter.

1702
01:17:38,260 --> 01:17:39,780
Um, I met the place stuff this week.

1703
01:17:39,780 --> 01:17:42,260
Actually, I met the place up earlier this afternoon.

1704
01:17:42,260 --> 01:17:48,180
I downloaded our purchase and downloaded the Lego expansion for, um, Forza Horizon 4.

1705
01:17:48,740 --> 01:17:53,940
And it looks amazing, but I had a killer migraine earlier this afternoon.

1706
01:17:53,940 --> 01:18:00,340
So instead of playing the game because my kids were being very loud and obnoxious, I

1707
01:18:00,340 --> 01:18:04,740
decided to lay in a dark room with my head on a pillow waiting for the pain to go away.

1708
01:18:05,940 --> 01:18:07,460
So that's what I did instead.

1709
01:18:07,460 --> 01:18:12,180
But I intend to play that and I've got, um, you know, my wife's going to be out of town

1710
01:18:12,180 --> 01:18:15,460
this week, so that means I can stream possibly later at night.

1711
01:18:15,460 --> 01:18:20,980
So I may end up streaming some Forza Horizon 4, uh, with the Lego DLC stuff because it

1712
01:18:20,980 --> 01:18:21,620
looks amazing.

1713
01:18:22,260 --> 01:18:22,980
Like, absolutely.

1714
01:18:22,980 --> 01:18:25,540
Like that needs to be a full, they just need to make a full game of that.

1715
01:18:25,540 --> 01:18:28,820
Well, you know, Bobby was just talking about it on his show cause I guess he played it

1716
01:18:28,820 --> 01:18:30,420
and he says, I see why they didn't make it a full game.

1717
01:18:30,420 --> 01:18:34,180
I guess there's, there are parts that aren't quite as filled out as others, but, um, they

1718
01:18:34,180 --> 01:18:35,460
should fill it out.

1719
01:18:35,460 --> 01:18:36,100
Okay.

1720
01:18:36,100 --> 01:18:38,420
Anyway, um, let me talk about my gaming week.

1721
01:18:38,420 --> 01:18:42,660
So I, I did, uh, make an effort to try to play some games, uh, that I haven't played

1722
01:18:42,660 --> 01:18:42,980
yet.

1723
01:18:42,980 --> 01:18:46,740
Uh, now not to say I didn't play my normal stuff cause I've still played Diablo three.

1724
01:18:46,740 --> 01:18:52,580
I just got my silver season badge unlocked cause I, I, uh, beat a set dungeon was the

1725
01:18:52,580 --> 01:18:53,300
last thing I needed.

1726
01:18:53,300 --> 01:18:54,980
So now I'm working on my gold badge.

1727
01:18:54,980 --> 01:18:57,780
So there's that, uh, I'm up to Paragon 180.

1728
01:18:57,780 --> 01:18:58,740
So I'm doing pretty good.

1729
01:18:58,740 --> 01:19:02,100
Um, usually you have to be a little bit further before you get silver, but I'm doing pretty

1730
01:19:02,100 --> 01:19:02,500
good.

1731
01:19:02,500 --> 01:19:05,700
And then of course, continuing to play Final Fantasy 14 gearing up for the expansion.

1732
01:19:05,700 --> 01:19:10,500
I'm trying to get my machinist to level 70 because those abilities with the new machinist

1733
01:19:10,500 --> 01:19:15,620
and, um, uh, I keep wanting to say storm blood, but that's the current expansion shadow bringers.

1734
01:19:15,620 --> 01:19:20,340
I'm really excited about being able to, uh, use some of those newer abilities.

1735
01:19:20,340 --> 01:19:22,660
So, um, yeah, I want to get my machinist to 70.

1736
01:19:22,660 --> 01:19:24,260
So that's the stuff I've been playing.

1737
01:19:24,260 --> 01:19:28,580
Now, some new stuff, uh, I went, well, I went back to Beat Saber, but the reason why is

1738
01:19:28,580 --> 01:19:32,420
because they released a pack for Beat Saber.

1739
01:19:32,420 --> 01:19:35,700
That is 10 Imagine Dragons songs.

1740
01:19:35,700 --> 01:19:36,100
That's right.

1741
01:19:36,100 --> 01:19:39,780
The band, Imagine Dragons, they put their songs in Beat Saber, which I have to admit

1742
01:19:39,780 --> 01:19:44,420
at first, I was a little bit like, this is weird because that's not the usual type of

1743
01:19:44,420 --> 01:19:46,580
song that you have in Beat Saber.

1744
01:19:46,580 --> 01:19:47,940
But I think that's the point.

1745
01:19:47,940 --> 01:19:50,180
They want to put different types of songs into Beat Saber.

1746
01:19:50,180 --> 01:19:54,020
Keep in mind, I don't play on the PC where I understand the game has been modded to hell

1747
01:19:54,020 --> 01:19:55,620
and every song you can think of is in it.

1748
01:19:55,620 --> 01:20:00,740
But, um, I kind of agree with Bobby on this, the modding community, most of the time, not

1749
01:20:00,740 --> 01:20:06,100
all the time, wants to just flex their pain on how difficult can we make these songs.

1750
01:20:06,100 --> 01:20:08,660
And that's not fun for me.

1751
01:20:08,660 --> 01:20:13,540
Fun for some of you Beat Saber experts, but those of us that can't move that fast, it's

1752
01:20:13,540 --> 01:20:14,500
just not as fun.

1753
01:20:14,500 --> 01:20:15,940
Like I watch other people do it.

1754
01:20:15,940 --> 01:20:16,260
Neat.

1755
01:20:16,260 --> 01:20:16,740
I agree.

1756
01:20:16,740 --> 01:20:18,420
It's like the DDR community.

1757
01:20:18,420 --> 01:20:23,460
It's basically, this is why it is the DDR thing all over again.

1758
01:20:23,460 --> 01:20:25,700
It's why In the Groove was so hard.

1759
01:20:25,700 --> 01:20:32,100
It's why the new songs that seem to come out from Konami on the new DDR games are so

1760
01:20:32,100 --> 01:20:36,580
goddamn hard is because that's where a lot of players want to play.

1761
01:20:37,220 --> 01:20:40,420
But sometimes, you know, it's just fun just to play a song.

1762
01:20:40,420 --> 01:20:44,500
It's sometimes fun when the hand waves go with the drum beat and you can almost like

1763
01:20:44,500 --> 01:20:45,140
freestyle a little bit.

1764
01:20:45,140 --> 01:20:45,780
Oh yes, that's right.

1765
01:20:45,780 --> 01:20:50,980
I did play DDR this week in a 111 degree garage and I regretted it immediately.

1766
01:20:51,940 --> 01:20:52,900
And I streamed it though.

1767
01:20:52,980 --> 01:20:53,940
So yeah.

1768
01:20:54,820 --> 01:20:59,700
Anyway, so yeah, Metal Mayhem in chat says Imagine Dragons has nine songs above and beyond

1769
01:20:59,700 --> 01:21:00,660
Radioactive.

1770
01:21:00,660 --> 01:21:01,940
That was kind of my first thing too.

1771
01:21:01,940 --> 01:21:06,900
And that song in particular Radioactive is just, it's been played to death on the radio.

1772
01:21:06,900 --> 01:21:09,380
And let me tell you what really bugs me about that song.

1773
01:21:10,100 --> 01:21:14,260
Not to shit on Imagine Dragons because actually they've done a lot of like wonderful, awesome

1774
01:21:14,260 --> 01:21:15,620
things for the LGBTQ community.

1775
01:21:15,620 --> 01:21:16,740
So I give them a big thumbs up.

1776
01:21:16,740 --> 01:21:21,140
They are very actively involved with that because I guess the guy is a Mormon, was a

1777
01:21:21,140 --> 01:21:25,220
Mormon, and has worked a lot with Mormons and the coming out thing.

1778
01:21:25,220 --> 01:21:26,820
So thumbs up to you, dude.

1779
01:21:26,820 --> 01:21:28,340
I'm not going to talk a lot of shit.

1780
01:21:28,340 --> 01:21:32,580
But that song Radioactive, the part that bugs me is that there's some line in it that says

1781
01:21:33,380 --> 01:21:40,580
I inhale the chemicals and there's like a clip of him taking a big breath.

1782
01:21:40,580 --> 01:21:44,340
And I'm like, oh God, that's like listening to somebody chew their food very loudly.

1783
01:21:45,140 --> 01:21:46,340
Why is that in a song?

1784
01:21:46,340 --> 01:21:49,300
And I always want to change the channel when I hear that on the radio.

1785
01:21:49,940 --> 01:21:53,780
But that song aside, some of their other songs are actually pretty good.

1786
01:21:53,780 --> 01:21:54,420
I like that.

1787
01:21:54,420 --> 01:21:57,380
Like there's a song, it's the very first one, Bad Liar, I think it's called.

1788
01:21:57,380 --> 01:22:01,860
That's like a slow song and it's got a nice little, it's got a good hook to it.

1789
01:22:01,860 --> 01:22:03,300
And it's like a slow jam.

1790
01:22:03,300 --> 01:22:06,900
So it's weird to play it in Beat Saber, but I'm kind of like, I'm kind of into this.

1791
01:22:06,900 --> 01:22:13,220
Like it does what DDR did to some of those slower songs.

1792
01:22:13,220 --> 01:22:17,220
And it's like, it invented its own beat to go with the song.

1793
01:22:17,300 --> 01:22:24,900
And the way you kind of like make your own beat is kind of enhances the song a little bit.

1794
01:22:24,900 --> 01:22:27,780
So I thought the note chart to that was a lot of fun.

1795
01:22:27,780 --> 01:22:29,380
So that's probably my favorite song to play right now.

1796
01:22:30,020 --> 01:22:30,420
All right.

1797
01:22:30,420 --> 01:22:30,820
Yeah.

1798
01:22:30,820 --> 01:22:31,540
So I enjoyed that.

1799
01:22:33,060 --> 01:22:33,460
Let's see.

1800
01:22:34,020 --> 01:22:38,100
Going to our chat over Twitch TV slash vog network.

1801
01:22:38,820 --> 01:22:41,860
Dark Tetsuya says Radioactive just reminds me of USL.

1802
01:22:41,860 --> 01:22:44,660
Travis used to play that song all the time on his Twitch days.

1803
01:22:44,660 --> 01:22:46,100
Oh, he did, didn't he?

1804
01:22:46,100 --> 01:22:46,820
That's right.

1805
01:22:46,820 --> 01:22:48,580
I think there might've been like a parody or something too.

1806
01:22:49,540 --> 01:22:49,940
Let's see.

1807
01:22:50,580 --> 01:22:54,100
SJ100Matt talks about music game elitist across all platforms.

1808
01:22:54,100 --> 01:22:54,340
Yep.

1809
01:22:54,340 --> 01:22:54,660
Yep.

1810
01:22:54,660 --> 01:22:55,460
It happens.

1811
01:22:55,460 --> 01:22:58,420
Bobby Blackwolf reminds us Imagine Dragons are all drummers too.

1812
01:22:58,420 --> 01:23:02,820
So it worked a lot better, but I doubt they designed the beat charts, but sure.

1813
01:23:02,820 --> 01:23:06,900
Some of their songs probably lent themselves pretty well to the game because of that.

1814
01:23:06,900 --> 01:23:10,660
Anyway, if you sample the songs, they're obviously all over YouTube.

1815
01:23:10,660 --> 01:23:12,660
It's all of the like Imagine Dragons singles.

1816
01:23:13,620 --> 01:23:18,100
Go look it up on YouTube and you'll probably make a decision if it's for you.

1817
01:23:18,100 --> 01:23:19,620
Cause I think it's kind of nice.

1818
01:23:19,620 --> 01:23:21,780
Anyway, other games I played.

1819
01:23:21,780 --> 01:23:24,180
Trials of Mana I played quite a bit of this week.

1820
01:23:24,180 --> 01:23:26,980
I already talked about that a little bit earlier in the show, so I won't recap too much.

1821
01:23:26,980 --> 01:23:29,780
But I streamed probably about two and a half hours of me playing it.

1822
01:23:29,780 --> 01:23:32,740
And yeah, I'm having fun enjoying that game.

1823
01:23:32,740 --> 01:23:36,580
It's kind of interesting to revisit like Secret of Mana, but it's not Secret of Mana.

1824
01:23:37,380 --> 01:23:41,780
And I'm having to adjust to the Super Nintendo way of playing things where

1825
01:23:41,780 --> 01:23:44,340
sometimes things are a little bit clunkier and a little bit slower.

1826
01:23:44,340 --> 01:23:47,460
Cause it battles we're not 60 frames a second like they are today.

1827
01:23:47,460 --> 01:23:48,980
So, you know, it's taking a little bit of getting used to.

1828
01:23:48,980 --> 01:23:53,940
But otherwise I'm really enjoying, otherwise I'm really enjoying like again,

1829
01:23:53,940 --> 01:23:57,460
I am able to look at this game and go, wow, for considering the age of this game,

1830
01:23:57,460 --> 01:23:59,940
the fact that it has like the branching storylines

1831
01:23:59,940 --> 01:24:03,060
and the multiple beginnings of the game is kind of neat.

1832
01:24:03,060 --> 01:24:05,140
Like, you know, you didn't see that in a lot of games back then.

1833
01:24:05,140 --> 01:24:06,020
So that was pretty cool.

1834
01:24:07,700 --> 01:24:10,100
And then the last game I played a bit of this week,

1835
01:24:10,100 --> 01:24:14,020
because I bought that Xbox ultimate game pass, I should probably try something with it.

1836
01:24:14,020 --> 01:24:17,300
So I played a game called Riverbond, which is like, it's like,

1837
01:24:17,300 --> 01:24:19,220
it's like got like a voxel art style.

1838
01:24:19,220 --> 01:24:23,780
So kind of like Minecraft VR style, but it's kind of like a platformer slash.

1839
01:24:23,780 --> 01:24:28,500
You have like a sword and you have like a gun that you can shoot the other voxels with.

1840
01:24:28,500 --> 01:24:31,060
So it's kind of like, that's a little bit of a platformer slash shooter

1841
01:24:31,060 --> 01:24:32,340
adventure type of game.

1842
01:24:32,340 --> 01:24:34,100
And it's, it's fine.

1843
01:24:34,100 --> 01:24:36,980
I haven't played a lot of it, but so far it's, you know, it's,

1844
01:24:37,060 --> 01:24:41,700
I like that you can change your main character to all these really different random things.

1845
01:24:41,700 --> 01:24:43,860
So I've been playing as the eggplant emoji,

1846
01:24:44,820 --> 01:24:46,820
because that's something you can play the game as.

1847
01:24:46,820 --> 01:24:47,540
So why not?

1848
01:24:47,540 --> 01:24:49,060
Don't shake your head at me, dark soccer.

1849
01:24:49,060 --> 01:24:49,700
You know, it's funny.

1850
01:24:49,700 --> 01:24:49,940
All right.

1851
01:24:50,820 --> 01:24:51,780
It is pretty funny.

1852
01:24:51,780 --> 01:24:54,340
It's a, an amused head shake.

1853
01:24:54,340 --> 01:24:57,460
Now I will point out, because somebody tweeted me or emailed about this.

1854
01:24:57,460 --> 01:25:00,980
I don't remember, but the next game I downloaded, I just haven't played it yet.

1855
01:25:00,980 --> 01:25:04,980
I did download Supermarket Shriek, and I'm really excited to play that because that is.

1856
01:25:04,980 --> 01:25:06,420
Oh, I do want to play that.

1857
01:25:07,300 --> 01:25:11,140
And I didn't realize, apparently that is a game that you can partially control with your voice.

1858
01:25:11,700 --> 01:25:13,060
I didn't know that was the thing.

1859
01:25:13,060 --> 01:25:14,020
That's even better.

1860
01:25:14,020 --> 01:25:15,780
That's why it's called Supermarket Shriek.

1861
01:25:15,780 --> 01:25:17,860
So I'm, I'm, I'm gonna figure this out.

1862
01:25:17,860 --> 01:25:19,220
Maybe I'll, maybe I'll do a live stream.

1863
01:25:19,220 --> 01:25:19,700
We'll see.

1864
01:25:19,700 --> 01:25:23,140
And I'll check that out this coming week, but that's the next game on a game pass ultimate.

1865
01:25:23,140 --> 01:25:24,100
I'm going to take a look at it.

1866
01:25:24,100 --> 01:25:27,780
I wanted, yeah, I do want to play like some more of these games.

1867
01:25:27,780 --> 01:25:32,180
I wish I almost had the Xbox to like play that stuff, but I don't want to get an Xbox at this

1868
01:25:32,180 --> 01:25:35,140
point, you know, not with the next console being right around the corner.

1869
01:25:35,140 --> 01:25:35,940
Yeah, that's true.

1870
01:25:35,940 --> 01:25:36,500
I understand.

1871
01:25:36,500 --> 01:25:37,620
Do you kind of wait for that?

1872
01:25:37,620 --> 01:25:41,300
Plus I have a PC, but like, you know, I understand.

1873
01:25:41,300 --> 01:25:41,800
All right.

1874
01:25:42,260 --> 01:25:46,420
Moving on, let's, let's go, let's go back to a time, you know, every week on this show,

1875
01:25:46,420 --> 01:25:50,740
we take a look back and as much as we've discussed all the new stuff up to March,

1876
01:25:50,740 --> 01:25:55,620
2020 through this year's E3, sometimes it's nice to revisit the classics and a segment

1877
01:25:55,620 --> 01:25:57,220
we call the classic game of the week.

1878
01:25:57,220 --> 01:26:00,260
And the way the classic game of the week works is that dark soccer is going to step into

1879
01:26:00,260 --> 01:26:05,540
the gaming vault and find a game that she thinks, Hey, this game is 10 years old or more.

1880
01:26:06,260 --> 01:26:07,540
This one's the or more.

1881
01:26:07,540 --> 01:26:10,500
This one's are more, this one's about 20 in it.

1882
01:26:10,500 --> 01:26:11,300
Close to it.

1883
01:26:11,300 --> 01:26:11,800
Yeah.

1884
01:26:12,020 --> 01:26:14,020
Cause it came out in November, 2000.

1885
01:26:14,020 --> 01:26:14,580
Okay.

1886
01:26:14,580 --> 01:26:15,620
So yeah, close to it.

1887
01:26:15,620 --> 01:26:18,260
So, uh, this is one that you kids need to be revisiting.

1888
01:26:18,260 --> 01:26:20,340
And I got to say it's, it's, it's so funny.

1889
01:26:20,340 --> 01:26:23,220
Cause dark soccer wasn't at her computer when she was picking the game this week.

1890
01:26:23,220 --> 01:26:24,660
So she's like, I want to do this game.

1891
01:26:24,660 --> 01:26:25,780
I'm like, you already did that one.

1892
01:26:25,780 --> 01:26:27,140
And I was going obscure too.

1893
01:26:27,140 --> 01:26:27,640
Yeah.

1894
01:26:27,860 --> 01:26:28,900
You already did that one.

1895
01:26:28,900 --> 01:26:32,020
And then she picked this one and I was like, okay, she had to have done this game.

1896
01:26:32,020 --> 01:26:34,820
And I was like, Oh my God, how has dark soccer not done this game?

1897
01:26:34,820 --> 01:26:37,060
This game is legendary.

1898
01:26:37,060 --> 01:26:38,020
So let's get to it.

1899
01:26:38,020 --> 01:26:40,740
What is the classic game of the week this week?

1900
01:26:40,740 --> 01:26:41,940
I picked sin and punishment.

1901
01:26:42,980 --> 01:26:47,700
So basically it is a rail shooter slash shooting gallery game.

1902
01:26:47,700 --> 01:26:50,820
It was a code developed by treasure and Nintendo.

1903
01:26:50,820 --> 01:26:51,860
You know, it's treasure.

1904
01:26:51,860 --> 01:26:54,980
It's gotta be freaking amaze balls.

1905
01:26:54,980 --> 01:27:01,220
So it was published for the Nintendo 64 in 2000 and it takes place in the dystopian

1906
01:27:01,220 --> 01:27:04,340
2007 because famine.

1907
01:27:04,900 --> 01:27:11,780
And shit, but at any rate, um, uh, basically scientists have created a new species to raise

1908
01:27:11,780 --> 01:27:14,900
this food, but of course there's things science shouldn't do.

1909
01:27:14,900 --> 01:27:19,300
The species all, you know, mutate and go back and everything.

1910
01:27:19,860 --> 01:27:25,540
So it has, um, the game is actually a unique one.

1911
01:27:26,180 --> 01:27:31,060
Basically it, it is, um, you have two players, sake and IDON.

1912
01:27:31,700 --> 01:27:37,460
But it uses a different layout for the Nintendo 64 controller.

1913
01:27:37,460 --> 01:27:44,340
So it uses both the D pad and the control stick and it lets you strafe, jump and dodge

1914
01:27:44,340 --> 01:27:48,180
on the screen while aiming your target.

1915
01:27:49,060 --> 01:27:53,620
So you have to shoot at enemies and projectiles while dodging the attacks to progress through

1916
01:27:53,620 --> 01:27:54,120
the game.

1917
01:27:54,680 --> 01:28:01,480
So at any rate, um, this particular game had some of the longest development time for a

1918
01:28:01,480 --> 01:28:02,600
game of its time.

1919
01:28:03,320 --> 01:28:13,480
Um, it, uh, it started in 1997 with only four people on staff and, uh, basically it concluded

1920
01:28:13,480 --> 01:28:20,680
in 2000 with more people that were involved in any of other treasures, um, previous projects.

1921
01:28:21,320 --> 01:28:27,720
And it wanted to develop Sin and Punishment, um, with the design of the Nintendo 64 controller

1922
01:28:27,720 --> 01:28:33,240
in mind, but they wanted to make a game where you hold the left side of the controller instead

1923
01:28:33,240 --> 01:28:36,520
of the right side of the controller, which was average for most games.

1924
01:28:37,400 --> 01:28:43,960
So they had some difficulty programming the game, the 3D rendering of the machine and

1925
01:28:43,960 --> 01:28:48,520
trying to adapt 2D gameplay into the 3D environment was kind of weird.

1926
01:28:48,520 --> 01:28:52,520
And the game was originally called Glass Soldier, but Nintendo renamed it to Sin and

1927
01:28:52,520 --> 01:28:55,960
Punishment because they wanted to have a name that would stand out.

1928
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:59,640
It was released to pretty positive reviews.

1929
01:29:00,280 --> 01:29:07,400
Um, it was, uh, definitely lauded for its high intensity and flashy graphics for its

1930
01:29:07,400 --> 01:29:07,900
time.

1931
01:29:08,360 --> 01:29:12,760
And then, um, a few even pointed out that Treasure has this amazing ability to reduce

1932
01:29:12,840 --> 01:29:19,720
their polygon count to maintain smooth gameplay, but keeping the graphics stylish, quote, quote,

1933
01:29:19,720 --> 01:29:20,220
quote.

1934
01:29:21,320 --> 01:29:25,880
Anyway, um, it was never released in the West, um, and it did get a pretty big following

1935
01:29:25,880 --> 01:29:26,920
among import gamers.

1936
01:29:26,920 --> 01:29:29,800
This is one that I never actually imported, but we had talked about.

1937
01:29:30,520 --> 01:29:35,720
Um, and eventually people really started demanding it for the Virtual Console.

1938
01:29:35,720 --> 01:29:42,040
So finally we had a Western release in 2007 for the Virtual Console and it is considered

1939
01:29:42,040 --> 01:29:45,560
one of the best Nintendo 64 games ever.

1940
01:29:45,560 --> 01:29:48,680
And it also was, uh, ported to the IQ player in China.

1941
01:29:48,680 --> 01:29:49,800
You know the IQ is, right?

1942
01:29:51,240 --> 01:29:52,520
Not the intelligent cube.

1943
01:29:52,520 --> 01:29:53,000
Okay.

1944
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:54,680
It's I Q U E.

1945
01:29:55,400 --> 01:30:00,120
So in China, they had passed a law that made video game consoles illegal.

1946
01:30:00,120 --> 01:30:04,120
So the IQ was released as sort of, uh, a handheld unit.

1947
01:30:04,120 --> 01:30:09,000
It wasn't a console and it came with different Nintendo 64 games that you could download

1948
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:13,800
through a service or, you know, a few of them came pre-installed.

1949
01:30:13,800 --> 01:30:16,360
So it's basically a handheld Nintendo 64.

1950
01:30:17,160 --> 01:30:23,240
So anyway, um, it did have a sequel for the Wii in 2009 called Sin and Punishment Star

1951
01:30:23,800 --> 01:30:24,440
Successor.

1952
01:30:25,480 --> 01:30:32,680
Um, at any rate, um, it got great reviews all over the world and it was even reviewed,

1953
01:30:32,680 --> 01:30:35,400
um, by Western, uh, gaming magazines.

1954
01:30:35,720 --> 01:30:42,440
Like IGN just said it was, you know, a, and I'm going to use a quote, a tour de force

1955
01:30:42,440 --> 01:30:44,280
of arcade style shooting action.

1956
01:30:45,160 --> 01:30:50,280
And of course treasure has always been lauded for their, their, you know, just massively

1957
01:30:50,280 --> 01:30:51,640
wonderful games.

1958
01:30:51,640 --> 01:30:58,440
Um, uh, Eurogamer gave it a, um, a score of nine out of 10.

1959
01:30:58,440 --> 01:31:02,280
Hamitsu said 35 out of 40, which is pretty good for Hamitsu.

1960
01:31:02,920 --> 01:31:07,320
Um, but yeah, it got just really high ratings all over the place.

1961
01:31:07,320 --> 01:31:12,040
A retro gamer, which is, uh, a magazine that I was collecting for a little while.

1962
01:31:12,520 --> 01:31:16,760
Um, I like that when you had on the cover it have, you know, where it always says new

1963
01:31:16,760 --> 01:31:20,760
there said old, we have a bunch of retro gamers.

1964
01:31:20,760 --> 01:31:25,800
Um, but it listed Sin and Punishment on, uh, toward the top of their list in the top 10

1965
01:31:25,800 --> 01:31:33,720
Nintendo 64 games with its intensity and, uh, the, uh, level of sophistication in their

1966
01:31:33,720 --> 01:31:34,920
graphics.

1967
01:31:34,920 --> 01:31:42,040
Um, and, um, it's one of the, this is one of the best games among shooting gallery games

1968
01:31:42,040 --> 01:31:43,960
along with wild guns from 1984.

1969
01:31:44,600 --> 01:31:50,520
Um, there was a novelization of the game that was released in Japan and, um, a comic that

1970
01:31:50,520 --> 01:32:00,520
was, uh, printed in Dengeki Daioh magazine where Saki, um, was, uh, sorry, I was skipping

1971
01:32:00,520 --> 01:32:00,840
on a bit.

1972
01:32:00,840 --> 01:32:05,160
The character Saki appeared as an assist trophy in Super Smash Brothers Brawl.

1973
01:32:06,360 --> 01:32:12,840
And, um, and then of course there was the sequel for Wii in 2009, Sin and Punishment

1974
01:32:12,840 --> 01:32:13,560
Star Successor.

1975
01:32:14,440 --> 01:32:22,440
Um, so the, uh, the Japanese name is, hold on, I miss reading that.

1976
01:32:22,440 --> 01:32:24,760
This is, they, they mispronounced this.

1977
01:32:24,760 --> 01:32:26,520
Hoshito Keishousha.

1978
01:32:27,480 --> 01:32:29,560
Um, so Sin and Punishment.

1979
01:32:29,560 --> 01:32:30,200
So there you go.

1980
01:32:32,040 --> 01:32:32,440
That's it.

1981
01:32:34,200 --> 01:32:34,760
All right.

1982
01:32:34,760 --> 01:32:37,640
The classic game of the week and punishment.

1983
01:32:37,640 --> 01:32:38,840
I'm sorry, I had the name wrong.

1984
01:32:38,840 --> 01:32:40,040
Sumitobatsu.

1985
01:32:40,040 --> 01:32:42,600
And it was Hoshino Keishousha.

1986
01:32:42,600 --> 01:32:49,080
So the thing about this is that they changed, um, Chikyu to Hoshi because it's a different

1987
01:32:49,080 --> 01:32:51,000
reading for the same Kanji.

1988
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:58,200
Um, so it was a big thing because it was called Earth Successor, but they changed the pronunciation

1989
01:32:58,200 --> 01:32:58,680
of it.

1990
01:32:58,680 --> 01:33:01,880
So anyway, I was misreading it because I knew that that wasn't the words.

1991
01:33:01,880 --> 01:33:05,720
No worries, but what a great, you know, again, what we're looking at here, I think what we

1992
01:33:05,720 --> 01:33:08,760
actually pulled the video from here for Twitch, for those of you that are watching along tonight,

1993
01:33:08,760 --> 01:33:13,800
I think this is actually, uh, like on the Wii playing the N64 version of it.

1994
01:33:13,800 --> 01:33:18,520
So I don't know if they enhanced it at all, but for an N64 game, this looks great.

1995
01:33:18,520 --> 01:33:20,600
You know, you have to remember this is like a 20 year old game.

1996
01:33:20,600 --> 01:33:23,880
And this was, I actually do believe it looks this good on Nintendo 64.

1997
01:33:23,880 --> 01:33:25,320
I remember it being a good looking game.

1998
01:33:25,320 --> 01:33:26,840
It has been a long time.

1999
01:33:26,840 --> 01:33:31,000
Star Successor was even better, which is funny because let me go back to the studio shot

2000
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:35,400
here, but I remember when, um, Sin and Punishment Star Successor was announced and you like,

2001
01:33:35,400 --> 01:33:36,840
were really excited about that.

2002
01:33:36,840 --> 01:33:37,720
Obviously.

2003
01:33:37,720 --> 01:33:39,480
Um, I kind of hope they do another one.

2004
01:33:39,480 --> 01:33:43,560
I mean, if we're going to go revisit Panzer Dragoon, why not a Sin and Punishment 3?

2005
01:33:43,560 --> 01:33:44,520
I think that'd be pretty awesome.

2006
01:33:44,520 --> 01:33:48,120
It just might be hard to get the band back together to do it, but the switch is doing

2007
01:33:48,120 --> 01:33:48,600
well enough.

2008
01:33:48,600 --> 01:33:49,560
It might necessitate it.

2009
01:33:49,560 --> 01:33:50,120
Right.

2010
01:33:50,120 --> 01:33:51,320
Yeah, possibly.

2011
01:33:51,320 --> 01:33:55,800
Maybe it'll be included with the Nintendo 64 classic edition whenever they do that.

2012
01:33:55,800 --> 01:33:57,240
We never lose hope.

2013
01:33:57,240 --> 01:33:59,800
We need more joy from a treasure anyway.

2014
01:33:59,800 --> 01:34:01,400
Yeah, this treasure is happiness.

2015
01:34:02,040 --> 01:34:02,520
All right.

2016
01:34:02,520 --> 01:34:06,280
Well, um, we're going to get to our next segment here in a moment, but since we are, um, coming

2017
01:34:06,280 --> 01:34:09,960
to a studio break here while we do this, uh, prior recorded segment, um, Dark Soccer,

2018
01:34:09,960 --> 01:34:12,840
I know you have to leave us a little early tonight cause you have a work obligation really

2019
01:34:12,840 --> 01:34:13,640
early in the morning.

2020
01:34:13,640 --> 01:34:14,360
Fucking A.

2021
01:34:14,360 --> 01:34:14,600
Yeah.

2022
01:34:14,600 --> 01:34:14,920
Sorry to hear it.

2023
01:34:14,920 --> 01:34:18,440
Basically, I've got training at work on Monday and Tuesday, which requires me to be up at

2024
01:34:18,440 --> 01:34:19,560
five fucking 30 in the morning.

2025
01:34:19,560 --> 01:34:22,280
Which is funny because I'm a trainer and I'm like, there's no way in hell I'd have class

2026
01:34:22,280 --> 01:34:23,240
that early, but you're coming.

2027
01:34:23,240 --> 01:34:24,520
Class starts at seven.

2028
01:34:24,520 --> 01:34:25,800
Oh, yeah, but you gotta get up.

2029
01:34:25,800 --> 01:34:26,760
I have to get up.

2030
01:34:26,760 --> 01:34:27,560
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2031
01:34:27,560 --> 01:34:29,080
Cause it takes me about an hour to get ready.

2032
01:34:29,080 --> 01:34:33,240
I mean, I can push it and get up at six, but I will look like, you know, the swamp monster.

2033
01:34:33,240 --> 01:34:35,960
You got to put your face on, beat your face.

2034
01:34:35,960 --> 01:34:37,240
Yeah, I understand.

2035
01:34:37,800 --> 01:34:39,800
There's some days it's war paint.

2036
01:34:41,240 --> 01:34:41,720
All right.

2037
01:34:41,720 --> 01:34:45,640
Well, uh, before we let you go and say good night, Dark Soccer, um, first off, um, anything

2038
01:34:45,640 --> 01:34:48,440
you want to say about E3 this year or something like you're really looking forward to, and

2039
01:34:48,440 --> 01:34:56,040
then just any last thoughts for animal crossing bitches, aminal, animals crossing zoos makes

2040
01:34:56,040 --> 01:34:57,000
me happy.

2041
01:34:57,000 --> 01:34:59,880
Also eating cinnamon buns during the show made me happy too.

2042
01:35:00,520 --> 01:35:00,680
Yeah.

2043
01:35:00,680 --> 01:35:01,880
The cinnamon rolls are great.

2044
01:35:01,880 --> 01:35:02,920
It's fucking IKEA.

2045
01:35:02,920 --> 01:35:04,760
IKEA has the best.

2046
01:35:04,760 --> 01:35:06,040
I know you, you had sent me that text.

2047
01:35:06,040 --> 01:35:07,480
Like you want me to bring you any food from IKEA?

2048
01:35:07,480 --> 01:35:09,000
And I was like, don't bring like meatballs.

2049
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:10,280
They're not going to hold the whole trip here.

2050
01:35:10,280 --> 01:35:11,800
I'm like, bitch, I'm talking cinnamon rolls.

2051
01:35:11,800 --> 01:35:12,040
Yeah, I know.

2052
01:35:12,040 --> 01:35:13,160
But then you were like cinnamon rolls.

2053
01:35:13,160 --> 01:35:15,960
I was like, Ooh, things I didn't know I need until she said it.

2054
01:35:15,960 --> 01:35:16,680
I bought two trays.

2055
01:35:16,680 --> 01:35:17,720
So I have a tray at home.

2056
01:35:17,720 --> 01:35:18,040
All right.

2057
01:35:18,040 --> 01:35:19,720
Well, um, have a great rest of your night, Dark Soccer.

2058
01:35:19,720 --> 01:35:24,200
And we'll see you back here in seven days to celebrate 17 years of orange launch radio.

2059
01:35:24,200 --> 01:35:26,280
If you can believe it next week.

2060
01:35:26,280 --> 01:35:31,080
But you know, I'm glad that it's that weekend cause I'm going to be gone for San Francisco

2061
01:35:31,080 --> 01:35:31,560
pride.

2062
01:35:32,280 --> 01:35:33,720
Oh, the next weekend, right?

2063
01:35:33,720 --> 01:35:34,120
Yeah.

2064
01:35:34,120 --> 01:35:35,720
Cause I'm marching.

2065
01:35:35,720 --> 01:35:37,800
We, I'm going to kind of decide.

2066
01:35:37,800 --> 01:35:41,720
I just found out, I think Bobby's going to be gone that week and we're going to be up

2067
01:35:41,720 --> 01:35:48,360
in Reno cause I don't want to brag, but I have VIP tickets to see Carly Rae Jepsen that

2068
01:35:48,360 --> 01:35:48,920
Saturday.

2069
01:35:50,360 --> 01:35:52,840
So, uh, up in Reno.

2070
01:35:52,840 --> 01:35:57,560
So instead of going to SF pride, I'm going to Reno girl, but I'm going to a Carly Rae

2071
01:35:57,560 --> 01:35:59,320
Jepsen concert, which is basically gay pride.

2072
01:35:59,320 --> 01:36:00,040
Come on.

2073
01:36:00,120 --> 01:36:01,560
So, uh, I'm going to that.

2074
01:36:01,560 --> 01:36:04,920
And then, so there's a part of me, it's like, eh, why rush home from Reno to do the show?

2075
01:36:04,920 --> 01:36:07,560
Maybe, maybe we'll, uh, so if you're not going to be here, I don't know.

2076
01:36:07,560 --> 01:36:07,960
We'll see.

2077
01:36:07,960 --> 01:36:08,280
We'll see.

2078
01:36:08,280 --> 01:36:10,440
I feel more time to yourself.

2079
01:36:12,440 --> 01:36:12,920
We'll see.

2080
01:36:12,920 --> 01:36:13,160
I don't know.

2081
01:36:13,160 --> 01:36:13,720
We'll talk about it.

2082
01:36:13,720 --> 01:36:15,480
We'll talk about it in this coming week and see what we do.

2083
01:36:15,480 --> 01:36:18,120
We can also record something in advance, like quickly or something.

2084
01:36:18,120 --> 01:36:19,640
And who does that anymore?

2085
01:36:19,640 --> 01:36:21,960
Um, well, I don't know what you can do on Twitch.

2086
01:36:21,960 --> 01:36:22,200
All right.

2087
01:36:22,200 --> 01:36:26,520
Anyway, I'll do this show myself or we experience that.

2088
01:36:26,520 --> 01:36:32,600
I want everyone to pray for me and this has nothing to do with my training, but I have

2089
01:36:32,600 --> 01:36:42,440
finally sat down and I'm learning logic pro so that I can do a podcast using the, um,

2090
01:36:42,440 --> 01:36:44,040
the soundboard in logic pro.

2091
01:36:45,080 --> 01:36:47,560
So pray for me, I'm, I'm learning it so far.

2092
01:36:47,560 --> 01:36:49,640
I have made a really weird loop track.

2093
01:36:49,640 --> 01:36:49,800
Good.

2094
01:36:49,800 --> 01:36:52,360
And then what you learn, you can come over to this show and use.

2095
01:36:52,360 --> 01:36:55,720
Well, I'm still planning on working on a theme song for us.

2096
01:36:56,280 --> 01:36:59,080
Instead of, you know, something that doesn't sound like it's a dungeon crawler theme.

2097
01:36:59,080 --> 01:37:01,400
I, Hey, now I sent you that track though.

2098
01:37:01,400 --> 01:37:02,040
It sounded good.

2099
01:37:02,040 --> 01:37:03,880
Oh, I thought you're, you're teasing the midi head thing.

2100
01:37:03,880 --> 01:37:04,360
And I'm like that.

2101
01:37:04,360 --> 01:37:04,920
No, no, no.

2102
01:37:04,920 --> 01:37:06,040
I'm talking about mine.

2103
01:37:06,040 --> 01:37:06,440
Oh no.

2104
01:37:06,440 --> 01:37:08,920
You remember the first one that I made learning garage.

2105
01:37:08,920 --> 01:37:11,000
Maybe you were like, here, what do you think about this for an OLR intro?

2106
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:15,800
And I was like, no, no, no, not that I did another one for an OLR intro, but I did one

2107
01:37:15,800 --> 01:37:18,840
that I sent you that sounds like it's a cave video game theme.

2108
01:37:18,840 --> 01:37:22,120
And I was like, I love that you're expressing your art.

2109
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:25,720
I'm not sure it's the right fit for a show intro.

2110
01:37:25,720 --> 01:37:26,680
It's not peppy enough.

2111
01:37:26,680 --> 01:37:31,240
I need, no, I need to send, I, I, I, I kind of want to play it at some point for people

2112
01:37:31,240 --> 01:37:35,800
just to get some feedback, but yeah, it's, I'm, I'm learning my way through that and

2113
01:37:35,800 --> 01:37:39,160
there's better loops, uh, available in logic.

2114
01:37:39,160 --> 01:37:40,040
All right, cool.

2115
01:37:40,600 --> 01:37:41,000
All right.

2116
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:42,280
Well, we'll see you next week.

2117
01:37:42,280 --> 01:37:46,600
Uh, in the meantime, we're going to go to a prior recorded segment earlier where I sat

2118
01:37:46,600 --> 01:37:50,600
down with some of the, uh, Pokemon biggest Pokemon fans here at the voice geeks network

2119
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:55,560
to talk a little bit about some of this news when it comes to Pokemon generation eight.

2120
01:37:55,560 --> 01:37:58,760
But, um, just a quick FYI guys, and I'm going to apologize in advance.

2121
01:37:58,760 --> 01:38:03,720
I, the audio for this kind of got screwed up a little bit and my voice is much louder

2122
01:38:03,720 --> 01:38:05,240
than the other people's voices.

2123
01:38:05,240 --> 01:38:06,280
So I'm really sorry about that.

2124
01:38:06,280 --> 01:38:08,520
That was a fail on my part, not on their part.

2125
01:38:08,520 --> 01:38:11,160
Because I was using the same setup I use for game streaming.

2126
01:38:11,160 --> 01:38:14,280
And usually I have the audio down on the game so I can talk over that.

2127
01:38:14,280 --> 01:38:19,240
And oops, it meant, so I'm going to try to fix it for the podcast, but just so you guys

2128
01:38:19,240 --> 01:38:23,240
know, um, just, it may sound a little off here as we air it live.

2129
01:38:23,240 --> 01:38:26,920
And I apologize for that, but please listen to what our guests tonight have to say here

2130
01:38:26,920 --> 01:38:29,240
about the Pokemon gen eight controversy.

2131
01:38:30,760 --> 01:38:31,160
Okay.

2132
01:38:31,160 --> 01:38:35,160
So I thought for our studio break this week, we could do something a little different.

2133
01:38:35,160 --> 01:38:39,480
Usually I'm like playing a game or something here and no, I'm not playing Pokemon sword

2134
01:38:39,480 --> 01:38:41,480
and shield, which is what's showing behind me.

2135
01:38:41,480 --> 01:38:45,080
But I thought, uh, this is actually just the Nintendo direct, uh, from a few days ago,

2136
01:38:45,080 --> 01:38:46,440
a couple of weeks, I guess at this point.

2137
01:38:46,600 --> 01:38:50,440
But I thought what we could do is actually talk about kind of a little bit of controversy

2138
01:38:50,440 --> 01:38:54,440
that came up about Pokemon generation eight, uh, from this year's E3 announcements.

2139
01:38:54,440 --> 01:38:58,920
And I thought, you know, to talk about this, why don't we invite on some Pokemon fans from

2140
01:38:58,920 --> 01:39:00,120
around the voice of geeks network?

2141
01:39:00,120 --> 01:39:04,360
So I'm joined tonight by of course, of course, if Pokemon comes up on orange launch radio,

2142
01:39:04,360 --> 01:39:05,480
of course, Shane's going to be here.

2143
01:39:05,480 --> 01:39:05,960
Hi, Shane.

2144
01:39:06,760 --> 01:39:07,480
Hello.

2145
01:39:07,480 --> 01:39:08,200
Hey, how are you doing?

2146
01:39:09,160 --> 01:39:10,120
I'm fine.

2147
01:39:10,120 --> 01:39:10,760
Good.

2148
01:39:10,760 --> 01:39:14,840
And also joining Shane and I tonight, uh, you also know from the voice geeks network

2149
01:39:14,840 --> 01:39:18,360
from the show game buoy, but you might've also heard, uh, another show that this guy

2150
01:39:18,360 --> 01:39:21,560
was on called stab cast for same type attack bonus.

2151
01:39:21,560 --> 01:39:22,680
Say hello to first mate.

2152
01:39:22,680 --> 01:39:23,240
Slide kick.

2153
01:39:24,200 --> 01:39:25,880
Hi, how are you?

2154
01:39:27,160 --> 01:39:27,960
I'm all right.

2155
01:39:27,960 --> 01:39:28,360
Just good.

2156
01:39:28,360 --> 01:39:31,000
I'm ready to talk about some Pokemans.

2157
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:31,240
Yeah.

2158
01:39:31,240 --> 01:39:32,120
Let's talk about it.

2159
01:39:32,120 --> 01:39:37,160
So, um, so I guess let me try to like summarize this in a nutshell and Shane, as usual, you

2160
01:39:37,160 --> 01:39:38,600
can correct everything that I got wrong.

2161
01:39:38,600 --> 01:39:39,000
Okay.

2162
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:40,200
Um, so okay.

2163
01:39:40,200 --> 01:39:42,440
I'm ready to do so.

2164
01:39:43,560 --> 01:39:43,960
Okay.

2165
01:39:44,040 --> 01:39:48,680
So here's the deal is that my understanding, at least, you know, I, I like Pokemon, but

2166
01:39:48,680 --> 01:39:51,880
I don't buy 17 copies of the game like you do, Shane.

2167
01:39:51,880 --> 01:39:54,120
Um, but my understand, okay, here's my understanding.

2168
01:39:54,120 --> 01:39:58,040
So there's a lot of like cool stuff about Pokemon sword and shield and Jenny.

2169
01:39:58,040 --> 01:40:01,960
And that is that, you know, um, you're going to have like, what is it like random encounters

2170
01:40:01,960 --> 01:40:03,800
mixed with encounters that you see in the wild.

2171
01:40:03,800 --> 01:40:04,040
Right.

2172
01:40:04,040 --> 01:40:08,520
So you can like actually encounters plus your random encounters still.

2173
01:40:08,520 --> 01:40:11,800
And there's yeah, there's what they want there.

2174
01:40:11,800 --> 01:40:14,760
And there's, um, like a 3d world, which looks really cool to me.

2175
01:40:14,760 --> 01:40:18,760
I liked the way the space looked like, instead of like just a 2d map, it looked a little

2176
01:40:18,760 --> 01:40:21,880
bit more like, I don't know, yeah, it looked pretty cool.

2177
01:40:21,880 --> 01:40:24,520
So anyway, but here's the controversial part.

2178
01:40:24,520 --> 01:40:25,960
If y'all haven't heard yet.

2179
01:40:25,960 --> 01:40:30,680
So what's happening is that of course, Pokemon kind of brands itself as the game as got to

2180
01:40:30,680 --> 01:40:31,400
catch them all.

2181
01:40:31,400 --> 01:40:31,640
Right.

2182
01:40:31,640 --> 01:40:37,240
And at this point, now that we're eight generations in, we're looking at over 800 Pokemon are

2183
01:40:37,240 --> 01:40:40,760
going to exist in the universe by the time this game comes out.

2184
01:40:40,760 --> 01:40:45,640
So one thing that was announced is that, uh, in this game, you're only going to be able

2185
01:40:45,640 --> 01:40:50,440
to catch Pokemon that are part of the Galar regional decks.

2186
01:40:50,440 --> 01:40:54,200
And that doesn't necessarily mean it's just the new Pokemon.

2187
01:40:54,200 --> 01:40:58,280
There are some old Pokemon mixed in there, and we even see it, uh, in this direct, we

2188
01:40:58,280 --> 01:41:02,520
see some, you know, notable, like I saw Raichu go by a minute ago, obviously Charizard's

2189
01:41:02,520 --> 01:41:03,480
back there right now.

2190
01:41:03,480 --> 01:41:08,360
So we know some of the old Pokemon will be back, but not all of the old Pokemon will

2191
01:41:08,360 --> 01:41:08,840
be back.

2192
01:41:08,840 --> 01:41:12,120
And this is causing quite a bit of controversy.

2193
01:41:12,120 --> 01:41:14,040
So let me start with Shane.

2194
01:41:14,040 --> 01:41:15,080
What's your angle?

2195
01:41:15,080 --> 01:41:16,200
Well, first, did I get it right?

2196
01:41:16,200 --> 01:41:17,720
And B, what's your angle on all this?

2197
01:41:17,720 --> 01:41:21,320
So yeah, you, you basically got it right.

2198
01:41:21,320 --> 01:41:29,160
What they're saying is that what they have basically curated to be the Pokemon in the

2199
01:41:29,160 --> 01:41:35,480
Galar region, um, that's it, nothing else can come in no matter what.

2200
01:41:36,360 --> 01:41:40,360
In old games like Sun and Moon, um, which we briefly talked about, uh, before the call

2201
01:41:40,360 --> 01:41:46,520
started, uh, you had your regional decks, which is everything you can catch in Sun and

2202
01:41:46,520 --> 01:41:47,240
Moon.

2203
01:41:47,240 --> 01:41:49,640
And then in most games you had a national decks.

2204
01:41:49,640 --> 01:41:54,520
You didn't in this one, which was fine, but because you could still bring your old Pokemon

2205
01:41:54,520 --> 01:42:00,280
from black and white, from Ruby Sapphire, from X and Y, all those, you could still bring

2206
01:42:00,280 --> 01:42:02,360
in at a certain point in the game.

2207
01:42:02,360 --> 01:42:07,800
Basically, uh, I couldn't, I don't remember if it was after you were done or just whenever

2208
01:42:07,800 --> 01:42:09,000
you had access to bank.

2209
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:12,600
It's, it's been a while since I played Sun and Moon cause it's not that great.

2210
01:42:12,600 --> 01:42:16,360
Um, but in this one, you can't do that at all.

2211
01:42:16,360 --> 01:42:19,720
So my feelings, I was torn at first.

2212
01:42:19,720 --> 01:42:21,400
Oh no, I wasn't torn at first.

2213
01:42:21,400 --> 01:42:23,000
I didn't care at first.

2214
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:29,640
Um, I have a living decks in Pokemon bank, uh, that I don't want to say I worked hard

2215
01:42:29,640 --> 01:42:30,120
to make.

2216
01:42:30,120 --> 01:42:31,880
It wasn't that bad really.

2217
01:42:31,880 --> 01:42:37,800
Um, and I've been working on shinies for years and not being able to bring them all over

2218
01:42:39,080 --> 01:42:44,680
to me personally, I don't mind it for how I play the game.

2219
01:42:45,560 --> 01:42:49,240
But wait quickly, how do, how quickly, how do you play the game?

2220
01:42:49,800 --> 01:42:50,440
Summarize that.

2221
01:42:51,240 --> 01:42:56,760
So I just, I, I play the game from start to finish, like just by catching what's there.

2222
01:42:56,760 --> 01:43:03,080
I don't import anything over unless I'm specifically trying to do something like I made a team

2223
01:43:03,080 --> 01:43:08,920
of smear goal for ultra Sun and ultra Moon so I could catch shinies easier.

2224
01:43:08,920 --> 01:43:13,560
Um, but beyond that, it's not like I have some Pokemon that I've had for forever.

2225
01:43:13,560 --> 01:43:19,560
I have, uh, I have a Pokemon from my original copy of diamond.

2226
01:43:19,560 --> 01:43:23,880
I think it was that I've carried over since then.

2227
01:43:23,880 --> 01:43:29,960
Um, so that's years and years at this point, but I don't use them in any post game things.

2228
01:43:29,960 --> 01:43:31,720
I use them basically for breeding.

2229
01:43:31,720 --> 01:43:36,600
If I need to, even my beloved Oshawa, I don't bring them over.

2230
01:43:36,600 --> 01:43:40,600
It's not unless I'm hatching or something like that.

2231
01:43:40,600 --> 01:43:42,360
It's not that big of a deal to me.

2232
01:43:42,360 --> 01:43:44,760
So you're, so you're, you're at peace with this.

2233
01:43:44,760 --> 01:43:47,880
You're, you did not participate in the rabble rabble or, or.

2234
01:43:48,840 --> 01:43:57,560
So no, I did not participate in all the angry people mob thing, but like after a little

2235
01:43:57,560 --> 01:44:04,520
bit of reflection and reading some stories, I, well, I'm not personally affected by this.

2236
01:44:04,520 --> 01:44:10,200
I am upset for the people that are, and I do want them to change their stance.

2237
01:44:10,760 --> 01:44:17,320
Um, I read a story about some guy who traded Pokemon with his friend when they were younger

2238
01:44:17,320 --> 01:44:20,600
and his friend got terminally ill and gave him all his Pokemon.

2239
01:44:20,600 --> 01:44:21,800
That friend died.

2240
01:44:21,800 --> 01:44:28,120
And now those Pokemon technically have outlived how old that person's friend was.

2241
01:44:28,120 --> 01:44:33,320
Uh, by the time that they had passed away, I'm like, okay, well, some, a story like that

2242
01:44:33,320 --> 01:44:37,720
makes me realize, Hey, some of these mean more to people than they do to me.

2243
01:44:37,720 --> 01:44:41,880
And so they shouldn't like be upset about this.

2244
01:44:41,880 --> 01:44:44,280
They should, they should get what they want out of it.

2245
01:44:44,280 --> 01:44:47,320
Well, let me, let me ask John a question too, because I definitely want to hear your take

2246
01:44:47,320 --> 01:44:48,200
on this too, John.

2247
01:44:48,200 --> 01:44:53,560
Um, I know there's been a lot of, there's been a lot of rabble rabble as I described

2248
01:44:53,560 --> 01:44:59,320
it on Twitter so far as, you know, we saw a good old change.org petition, uh, asking

2249
01:44:59,320 --> 01:45:03,000
for Nintendo to reverse their decision on this and change this.

2250
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:04,520
What's your take on all this, John?

2251
01:45:04,520 --> 01:45:07,960
How did you feel when you were like seeing this petition and hearing all this news?

2252
01:45:08,200 --> 01:45:13,560
I mean, honestly, it's, it's, you know, it made me think of, uh, you know, you and I

2253
01:45:13,560 --> 01:45:18,760
do a show reading is fundamental about RuPaul's Drag Race, which, you know, for quite a few

2254
01:45:18,760 --> 01:45:23,240
years now has had a lot of fans behaving badly.

2255
01:45:23,800 --> 01:45:29,800
And I mean, I haven't really followed like the, I mean, I, I can't say I haven't followed

2256
01:45:29,800 --> 01:45:30,600
the Pokemon fandom.

2257
01:45:30,600 --> 01:45:36,920
I've been, you know, on Pokemon, like web forums since I was in high school and everything.

2258
01:45:37,880 --> 01:45:42,280
But like, you know, in terms of like, you know, especially these days with like social

2259
01:45:42,280 --> 01:45:47,880
media and everything and Reddit, like I don't really, um, typically have a pulse on what

2260
01:45:47,880 --> 01:45:55,000
the Pokemon fandom is like these days, but it, I mean, I kind of thought that, you know,

2261
01:45:55,000 --> 01:46:03,400
it seemed like a decent community, but, uh, I just think people are, um, like I heard

2262
01:46:03,400 --> 01:46:09,560
that people on the Nintendo tree house streams for completely non Pokemon games were like,

2263
01:46:09,560 --> 01:46:13,720
um, just complaining about no national Pokedex.

2264
01:46:14,840 --> 01:46:20,600
And so I think like, I mean, I personally feel like, um, there are so many Pokemon and

2265
01:46:20,600 --> 01:46:25,800
I definitely understand what other people, um, you know, I understand the other side

2266
01:46:25,800 --> 01:46:28,120
of the argument, but for me, there's so many Pokemon.

2267
01:46:28,760 --> 01:46:35,160
And what I always find is that like, you know, like I'm the type of person who typically

2268
01:46:36,120 --> 01:46:42,280
tries to build like one team that I, you know, maybe, maybe not like consistent from the

2269
01:46:42,280 --> 01:46:46,120
beginning because you know, that you catch them, you might maybe catch some later in

2270
01:46:46,120 --> 01:46:51,240
the game or whatever, but like, I kind of like try to look at, you know, like types

2271
01:46:51,240 --> 01:46:56,360
and like, you know, trying to aim for one team that I like, you know, bring up to the

2272
01:46:56,360 --> 01:46:58,440
elite four and the Pokemon league or whatever.

2273
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:05,640
Um, so I mean, I already feel like there are so many Pokemon that I don't really get a

2274
01:47:05,640 --> 01:47:13,160
chance to, um, you know, uh, have a, have a chance to play with or, you know, really,

2275
01:47:14,920 --> 01:47:15,960
um, experience.

2276
01:47:15,960 --> 01:47:21,960
So, I mean, adding a bunch of old Pokemon in there is only going to, you know, kind

2277
01:47:21,960 --> 01:47:27,880
of increase the temptation like, Oh, well I want a, you know, such and such, um,

2278
01:47:27,880 --> 01:47:31,800
I want a Pikachu and a Jigglypuff because those are the things I'm familiar with.

2279
01:47:31,800 --> 01:47:32,300
Right.

2280
01:47:33,720 --> 01:47:33,880
Right.

2281
01:47:33,880 --> 01:47:38,520
Or like you said, you might have a favorite and, you know, you want your favorite or you're

2282
01:47:38,520 --> 01:47:41,880
like, Oh, you know, this one has a really unique type and, you know, I want to build

2283
01:47:41,880 --> 01:47:42,600
my team around that.

2284
01:47:42,600 --> 01:47:43,400
So, I mean, I don't know.

2285
01:47:43,400 --> 01:47:49,240
I think it's going to, I hope that it's going to encourage people to, you know, give the

2286
01:47:49,240 --> 01:47:50,360
new Pokemon a chance.

2287
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:56,600
What I will say though, is I really feel like, and I mean, I don't know if this is like,

2288
01:47:56,600 --> 01:48:03,160
you know, pointless or, you know, worthless at this point, but, um, you know, I think

2289
01:48:03,160 --> 01:48:07,160
back to the Pokemon stadium games and I guess the reason, you know, the reason why they

2290
01:48:07,160 --> 01:48:11,960
originally existed was because, you know, the original games were on Game Boy and they

2291
01:48:11,960 --> 01:48:15,960
were, you know, pixels and it was like your way to see your Pokemon in 3d and everything,

2292
01:48:16,040 --> 01:48:21,960
but this might not be a bad time to start looking at bringing back if this is going

2293
01:48:21,960 --> 01:48:25,640
to be kind of their method moving forward, which they said it is.

2294
01:48:26,760 --> 01:48:26,920
Yeah.

2295
01:48:26,920 --> 01:48:33,400
So if that's really remains true, it might not be a bad idea to have some sort of like

2296
01:48:33,400 --> 01:48:35,800
cross-platform mobile.

2297
01:48:35,800 --> 01:48:41,560
And cause then that way the people on Pokemon go could still participate, have like a mobile

2298
01:48:42,280 --> 01:48:46,360
and, um, switch cross-platform thing.

2299
01:48:46,360 --> 01:48:48,120
That's kind of like a Pokemon stadium.

2300
01:48:48,120 --> 01:48:53,080
And it could have like a little Pokemon farm or whatever that, um, one game was like a

2301
01:48:53,080 --> 01:48:57,480
Pokemon show off space, like a Pokemon show off Pokemon ranch or something that you could

2302
01:48:57,480 --> 01:48:58,200
show everything off.

2303
01:48:58,200 --> 01:49:04,200
So you can like play with your Pokemon and you can, um, battle with them like in a separate,

2304
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:06,680
you know, situation.

2305
01:49:06,680 --> 01:49:09,320
And then that way they could, you know, just continually update it.

2306
01:49:10,280 --> 01:49:13,080
Shane, Shane, did you want to follow up on that before I go to another question?

2307
01:49:13,800 --> 01:49:17,160
Well, yeah, that's kind of what Pokemon home is supposed to be for.

2308
01:49:17,160 --> 01:49:19,480
They've stated it's where they're supposed to live.

2309
01:49:19,480 --> 01:49:25,800
Now, the problem with that is people I'm saying people being a little general here, a lot

2310
01:49:25,800 --> 01:49:31,160
of players from what I've read and I take the same stance.

2311
01:49:31,160 --> 01:49:37,720
It feels like it's more just like a holding area at this point, no matter what they do

2312
01:49:37,720 --> 01:49:44,440
for Pokemon home, it's they're charging you to keep your Pokemon there until you can bring

2313
01:49:44,440 --> 01:49:47,560
them in, which who knows what generation at this point you'll get to do that.

2314
01:49:47,560 --> 01:49:52,360
And that seems like a really, really bad decision.

2315
01:49:52,360 --> 01:49:52,680
Okay.

2316
01:49:52,680 --> 01:49:57,080
So my personal take on this whole thing, like, you know, I'm more of a casual Pokemon fan,

2317
01:49:57,080 --> 01:49:57,720
obviously.

2318
01:49:57,720 --> 01:50:02,840
And, um, there's a part of me that's kind of like, you know, it does, when you do say

2319
01:50:02,840 --> 01:50:06,680
gotta catch them all, it is a little weird to be saying we're going to release this game

2320
01:50:06,680 --> 01:50:08,680
and you really can't catch them all.

2321
01:50:08,680 --> 01:50:12,520
You know, and I got to admit, there's, there's, I mean, I think at the end of the day, let's

2322
01:50:12,520 --> 01:50:13,800
not, I'm not going to kid myself.

2323
01:50:13,800 --> 01:50:15,160
I'm still going to buy the game.

2324
01:50:15,160 --> 01:50:19,320
And I honestly think a lot of people out there that are upset will probably end up buying

2325
01:50:19,320 --> 01:50:19,800
the game anyway.

2326
01:50:19,800 --> 01:50:22,840
Not that I'm trying to invalidate the way anybody feels or anything like that, especially

2327
01:50:22,840 --> 01:50:26,440
with like some of the compelling stories you told Shane, like that completely makes sense.

2328
01:50:26,440 --> 01:50:31,720
But I do feel like when it comes down to the money, like it's not really going to change.

2329
01:50:31,720 --> 01:50:35,800
But I do have to admit, I get a little side eye with Game Freak because I even feel like

2330
01:50:35,800 --> 01:50:40,040
when they introduce Pokemon bank, they kind of set the stage as, oh, well, this is the

2331
01:50:40,040 --> 01:50:44,040
way you're going to store all your Pokemon in the future and be able to take your Pokemon

2332
01:50:44,040 --> 01:50:49,240
into future games and kind of gave that impression that like, you know, well, and then they put

2333
01:50:49,240 --> 01:50:51,000
Pokemon home out on top of Pokemon bank.

2334
01:50:51,720 --> 01:50:51,960
Yeah.

2335
01:50:51,960 --> 01:50:57,080
Well, and just to quickly interject, literally two weeks before this information happened,

2336
01:50:57,080 --> 01:51:01,880
they had that big presentation where they were saying how important or how they know

2337
01:51:01,880 --> 01:51:07,320
how important these Pokemon that we've raised since their first games they like they appeared

2338
01:51:07,320 --> 01:51:08,440
in are to us.

2339
01:51:08,440 --> 01:51:14,280
And that's what Pokemon home was supposed to to accomplish was being the new Pokemon

2340
01:51:14,280 --> 01:51:19,560
bank so we can bring our friends over into the new games.

2341
01:51:19,560 --> 01:51:23,400
And it seems to fly right in the face of that what they have chosen.

2342
01:51:24,200 --> 01:51:27,400
Let me ask one more question and then for time, I got to go ahead and wrap up here.

2343
01:51:27,400 --> 01:51:29,560
But and I'll start with John on this question.

2344
01:51:29,640 --> 01:51:34,600
But I think there's probably like a cynical part of me, especially looking at a lot of

2345
01:51:34,600 --> 01:51:39,320
E3 releases this year that kind of goes, for example, the Final Fantasy 7 remake.

2346
01:51:39,320 --> 01:51:41,640
Okay, Episode One is coming out on PlayStation 4.

2347
01:51:41,640 --> 01:51:44,680
But then what comes out the very next year, the PlayStation 5.

2348
01:51:44,680 --> 01:51:48,360
So they're going to get you to buy the Final Fantasy remake Episode One all over again

2349
01:51:48,360 --> 01:51:51,480
in preparation for Episode Two, which will probably be on the PlayStation 5.

2350
01:51:51,480 --> 01:51:55,960
How I'm tying that to Pokemon is that this is the way that they say that Pokemon Sword

2351
01:51:55,960 --> 01:51:57,240
and Shield is going to be.

2352
01:51:57,240 --> 01:52:00,760
But I think inevitably there will be a Pokemon gun, right?

2353
01:52:00,760 --> 01:52:03,320
Or we're all joking, calling it a Pokemon gun.

2354
01:52:03,320 --> 01:52:08,600
But there will be some sort of the equivalent of yellow, the equivalent of the best of or

2355
01:52:08,600 --> 01:52:09,240
whatever.

2356
01:52:09,240 --> 01:52:14,760
And perhaps that will be the game that you can bring all your Pokemon into.

2357
01:52:14,760 --> 01:52:18,840
Is that how you kind of forecast this going, John?

2358
01:52:18,840 --> 01:52:22,280
Or do you think that nope, this is going to just stay this way?

2359
01:52:22,280 --> 01:52:24,440
Yeah, it's definitely possible.

2360
01:52:26,520 --> 01:52:31,240
Like, I mean, I feel like they've got some thing in the works, like, whether it's that

2361
01:52:31,240 --> 01:52:39,800
or, you know, some sort of, like I said, a colosseum sort of thing that can really connect

2362
01:52:39,800 --> 01:52:41,720
with Pokemon home.

2363
01:52:42,280 --> 01:52:48,040
Like, I feel like there's going to be some sort of experience that like, I mean, I don't

2364
01:52:48,040 --> 01:52:53,000
know, maybe it's just maybe you can bring all your Pokemon into Pokemon sleep and sleep

2365
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:54,920
with sleep with all your favorite Pokemon.

2366
01:52:54,920 --> 01:52:58,360
No, I do think that's an interesting idea that's kind of come up from this discussion

2367
01:52:58,360 --> 01:53:03,160
that I didn't think of before is that perhaps there will be some other type of Pokemon game

2368
01:53:03,160 --> 01:53:07,000
where the main point of that game is to showcase your existing Pokemon.

2369
01:53:07,880 --> 01:53:10,440
Quickly, and then we'll wrap up, Shane, the same question.

2370
01:53:10,440 --> 01:53:13,960
Do you think this gets resolved in a Pokemon gun type of situation?

2371
01:53:15,000 --> 01:53:17,480
I think they're too stubborn to do that.

2372
01:53:17,480 --> 01:53:22,600
Another quick thing to point out is this game is also removing Megas and Z crystals.

2373
01:53:23,160 --> 01:53:29,000
So that all those mechanics where you get new versions of Pokemon too, or awesome moves

2374
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:30,680
kind of those are gone too.

2375
01:53:30,680 --> 01:53:37,640
And I feel like they, especially because the Japanese players via social media at least

2376
01:53:37,640 --> 01:53:43,480
have now accepted the fact that they're not getting the old Pokemon because of what in

2377
01:53:43,480 --> 01:53:45,000
interviews Game Freak has said.

2378
01:53:45,640 --> 01:53:48,040
I think there, I think this is it.

2379
01:53:48,040 --> 01:53:51,160
I think this is how it's going to be from now on, and they're not going to come back

2380
01:53:51,160 --> 01:53:51,720
from it.

2381
01:53:51,800 --> 01:53:55,400
I would hope for it differently, but I think they're done.

2382
01:53:55,400 --> 01:53:58,120
This is their new direction and they're sticking to it.

2383
01:53:58,680 --> 01:53:59,320
Okay.

2384
01:53:59,320 --> 01:54:00,040
Well, fair enough.

2385
01:54:00,040 --> 01:54:02,920
Well, they're waving goodbye in the direct, which means I'm running out of footage and

2386
01:54:02,920 --> 01:54:04,520
I got to start it over here pretty soon.

2387
01:54:04,520 --> 01:54:09,800
But while I do that, I want to wrap up here and head back to the studio live.

2388
01:54:09,800 --> 01:54:12,040
I want to thank you both for joining me tonight for this side discussion.

2389
01:54:12,040 --> 01:54:16,680
It was really cool and nice to talk about Pokemon with some Pokemon fans, but quickly

2390
01:54:16,680 --> 01:54:18,680
before we head out, do you guys have anything you want to plug?

2391
01:54:19,240 --> 01:54:21,720
Shane, I know you're not really hosting any shows right now.

2392
01:54:21,720 --> 01:54:23,640
Is there anything you want to plug before we head out?

2393
01:54:24,600 --> 01:54:26,280
Um, no.

2394
01:54:26,840 --> 01:54:27,080
Okay.

2395
01:54:27,080 --> 01:54:28,440
Well, thanks for being here nonetheless.

2396
01:54:29,160 --> 01:54:33,400
Jon, I know you have a show because I've been listening to like the, what, like three episodes

2397
01:54:33,400 --> 01:54:34,360
you just put out this week.

2398
01:54:34,360 --> 01:54:35,720
So tell us a little bit about that, Jon.

2399
01:54:36,360 --> 01:54:36,600
Yeah.

2400
01:54:36,600 --> 01:54:41,080
We're gamebuoy.org, your port of call for gaming news and videos that maybe you don't

2401
01:54:41,080 --> 01:54:42,760
turn your radar, but most definitely should be.

2402
01:54:42,760 --> 01:54:46,680
We just did almost daily episodes about E3.

2403
01:54:46,680 --> 01:54:50,520
So, you know, definitely, um, lots of news out there to digest.

2404
01:54:50,520 --> 01:54:55,160
And we actually haven't even talked about Pokemon just because there's been so much

2405
01:54:55,880 --> 01:54:57,240
in the gaming world.

2406
01:54:57,240 --> 01:54:59,640
You guys are going to need a whole episode.

2407
01:54:59,640 --> 01:55:01,960
You're going to need a whole episode for it anyway.

2408
01:55:01,960 --> 01:55:02,440
All right.

2409
01:55:02,440 --> 01:55:04,680
Thank you guys both for joining me tonight.

2410
01:55:04,680 --> 01:55:09,720
Let's go back to the studio live for the continuation of Orange Lounge Radio tonight.

2411
01:55:11,640 --> 01:55:11,960
All right.

2412
01:55:11,960 --> 01:55:15,080
That was a fun little, uh, different type of break segment there.

2413
01:55:15,080 --> 01:55:17,880
And Shane told me kind of like after we, we stopped recording and he's like, I could

2414
01:55:17,880 --> 01:55:21,320
have gone on for another 30 minutes about, and I'm like, I bet I wouldn't stop there.

2415
01:55:21,320 --> 01:55:22,440
It's too long of a break.

2416
01:55:22,440 --> 01:55:26,520
If only we hadn't had a podcast at one point that was all about Pokemon.

2417
01:55:26,520 --> 01:55:29,000
But anyway, did you also catch what I did in that video?

2418
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:31,320
By the way, I did like the number one thing you're not supposed to do.

2419
01:55:31,320 --> 01:55:33,960
I wore my green shirt with my green screen today.

2420
01:55:35,400 --> 01:55:42,360
Um, I didn't notice it then, but I did notice that the sheen from your light during your

2421
01:55:42,360 --> 01:55:46,040
Square Enix thing was causing parts of your face to like come out.

2422
01:55:46,040 --> 01:55:49,880
Well, part of the, I'm going to, I'm not going to throw Bobby under the bus for that completely,

2423
01:55:49,880 --> 01:55:52,040
but actually he was controlling the green screen on his end.

2424
01:55:52,040 --> 01:55:56,920
It wasn't my process against his, but, um, I think because the quality dips a little

2425
01:55:56,920 --> 01:55:59,240
bit because he's pulling a Skype image.

2426
01:55:59,240 --> 01:56:03,720
I think it just causes, yeah, it makes, it makes it, uh, wreak a little more havoc on

2427
01:56:03,720 --> 01:56:05,880
it, but we're learning, we're playing fine.

2428
01:56:05,880 --> 01:56:06,600
It was fine.

2429
01:56:06,600 --> 01:56:07,320
It's fine.

2430
01:56:07,320 --> 01:56:08,280
Mistakes are going to happen.

2431
01:56:08,280 --> 01:56:09,240
It's, it's all good.

2432
01:56:09,240 --> 01:56:12,360
So anyway, um, yeah.

2433
01:56:12,360 --> 01:56:13,880
So what do you, what do you think on all that?

2434
01:56:13,880 --> 01:56:15,960
You're just not, you're just not as big into Pokemon, right?

2435
01:56:15,960 --> 01:56:18,920
I just don't really care too much that not all the Pokemon are in there.

2436
01:56:18,920 --> 01:56:21,560
Cause I mean, you weren't going to catch them all anyway.

2437
01:56:22,200 --> 01:56:22,840
No.

2438
01:56:22,840 --> 01:56:23,160
All right.

2439
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:27,160
No, I mean, I, I haven't even finished.

2440
01:56:27,160 --> 01:56:27,800
Let's go.

2441
01:56:27,800 --> 01:56:31,800
Like, especially when they want you to do all the like challenges now where you have

2442
01:56:31,800 --> 01:56:33,880
to become the master of all the different Pokemon.

2443
01:56:33,880 --> 01:56:35,720
I'm like, no, no, I don't.

2444
01:56:35,720 --> 01:56:36,600
I'm done.

2445
01:56:36,600 --> 01:56:37,880
I need to check on the cat.

2446
01:56:37,880 --> 01:56:39,800
Why don't we start some rapid fire news here?

2447
01:56:41,080 --> 01:56:46,120
He's, he's trying to tear a hole through space and time or at least a box.

2448
01:56:46,120 --> 01:56:46,620
Who knows?

2449
01:56:47,160 --> 01:56:50,040
Anyways, let's talk a little bit about star control.

2450
01:56:50,040 --> 01:56:53,000
So star control and star control origins.

2451
01:56:53,560 --> 01:56:56,280
There was a lawsuit between those developers.

2452
01:56:56,280 --> 01:57:01,480
And of course now they have decided that they are settling that lawsuit.

2453
01:57:01,480 --> 01:57:02,040
Okay.

2454
01:57:02,040 --> 01:57:03,160
This mush update is more important.

2455
01:57:03,160 --> 01:57:04,280
Do you know what it is?

2456
01:57:04,280 --> 01:57:04,680
No.

2457
01:57:04,680 --> 01:57:07,000
Do you know how he moved the litter box to a covered litter box?

2458
01:57:07,000 --> 01:57:08,600
He's using the litter box right now.

2459
01:57:08,600 --> 01:57:10,600
We don't usually have that during OLR.

2460
01:57:10,600 --> 01:57:12,120
So what we had to do, so Mr.

2461
01:57:12,120 --> 01:57:17,240
Smoosh really loves to dig in the litter box a lot.

2462
01:57:17,240 --> 01:57:22,280
And so he had a litter box that was in the bathroom, but he would kick the litter outside

2463
01:57:22,280 --> 01:57:22,760
the box.

2464
01:57:23,320 --> 01:57:25,640
So his dad's got sick of that.

2465
01:57:25,640 --> 01:57:29,000
So they got him a covered litter box, but it won't fit in the bathroom.

2466
01:57:29,000 --> 01:57:30,600
So we had to move it out here into it.

2467
01:57:30,600 --> 01:57:33,000
So it's right on the, I guess you guys can't see it on Twitch.

2468
01:57:33,000 --> 01:57:34,440
It's right on the other side of the wall.

2469
01:57:34,440 --> 01:57:37,480
So when I heard the scratching, I was like, oh, he's, he's using the scratch post out

2470
01:57:37,480 --> 01:57:37,560
there.

2471
01:57:37,560 --> 01:57:40,920
And I'm like, what kind of ungodly noise is that?

2472
01:57:40,920 --> 01:57:41,960
It's litter box.

2473
01:57:41,960 --> 01:57:43,160
It does sound a little bit.

2474
01:57:43,160 --> 01:57:43,320
Yeah.

2475
01:57:43,320 --> 01:57:46,840
Cause my cat does the same thing, you know, it makes a lot more sense for she's in the

2476
01:57:46,840 --> 01:57:47,240
garage.

2477
01:57:47,240 --> 01:57:47,880
It's not a surprise.

2478
01:57:47,880 --> 01:57:50,680
It's not getting picked up by the mics, but yeah, I started walking over there and looked

2479
01:57:50,680 --> 01:57:54,520
over here and it's one of those litter boxes that he actually has to go inside.

2480
01:57:54,520 --> 01:57:56,360
Cause like the, the roof has like a little cut out.

2481
01:57:56,360 --> 01:57:58,440
And so I looked at, he's like peeking at me from up there.

2482
01:57:58,440 --> 01:58:00,280
I'm like, oh, oh, sorry about that.

2483
01:58:00,280 --> 01:58:01,320
Sorry about that.

2484
01:58:01,320 --> 01:58:02,600
Didn't mean to walk in on you, Mr.

2485
01:58:02,600 --> 01:58:02,920
Smoosh.

2486
01:58:03,720 --> 01:58:10,200
Anyway, so yes, they've settled, they have settled and apparently are going to be supporting

2487
01:58:10,200 --> 01:58:12,360
each other's endeavors as well.

2488
01:58:12,360 --> 01:58:14,360
So, um, very cool.

2489
01:58:14,920 --> 01:58:17,000
I'm looking forward to more star control games.

2490
01:58:17,000 --> 01:58:18,840
I used to love a star control too.

2491
01:58:20,360 --> 01:58:25,880
And then, um, we've got some news regarding, uh, moral combat 11.

2492
01:58:25,880 --> 01:58:34,200
So they have a brand new update that is going to be, um, introducing new brutalities into

2493
01:58:34,200 --> 01:58:35,560
the game as well.

2494
01:58:35,560 --> 01:58:45,880
And also kind of, um, leading the way for some of the DLC, but yeah, so interesting

2495
01:58:45,880 --> 01:58:52,680
that they had, like, apparently there's, um, a brutality for, uh, Cabal in the game where

2496
01:58:52,680 --> 01:58:54,520
he scares the soul of the player.

2497
01:58:55,160 --> 01:58:58,360
Um, that's a throwback to the classic from three.

2498
01:58:58,360 --> 01:58:59,000
Yeah.

2499
01:58:59,000 --> 01:59:02,840
Uh, they have a ton of different patch notes in here, but if you want to check it out,

2500
01:59:02,840 --> 01:59:09,240
I'm sure they've got it on moral comments site, but yes, uh, lots of updates and, you

2501
01:59:09,240 --> 01:59:10,920
know, balancing and stuff like that.

2502
01:59:12,040 --> 01:59:12,920
So cool.

2503
01:59:12,920 --> 01:59:17,400
Not really a big moral combat fan, but I am a fan of spawn, so I'll have to check that

2504
01:59:17,400 --> 01:59:19,720
out when they have been playable and see what that's all about.

2505
01:59:20,520 --> 01:59:22,120
Don't think it'll get me to buy the game though.

2506
01:59:25,240 --> 01:59:25,720
All right.

2507
01:59:25,720 --> 01:59:25,960
Yeah.

2508
01:59:25,960 --> 01:59:30,120
I Alan's been playing a lot of mortal combat 11, but y'all know, I don't know.

2509
01:59:30,120 --> 01:59:33,320
I like sometimes I'll kind of watch over, but you know, he does some weird thing.

2510
01:59:33,320 --> 01:59:37,320
Maybe you guys know more about this than I do, but like he leaves it running.

2511
01:59:37,320 --> 01:59:40,280
Like, like let's say we go out for food or something.

2512
01:59:40,280 --> 01:59:44,120
He'll bring up moral combat 11 and he goes into the AI mode and he has the AI battle

2513
01:59:44,120 --> 01:59:47,320
each other and he leaves that running while we go out for food, because I guess it's generating

2514
01:59:47,320 --> 01:59:49,720
coins for the craft or something doing that.

2515
01:59:49,720 --> 01:59:53,560
I didn't know that was the thing you could do, but that's, I guess, I don't know if it's

2516
01:59:53,560 --> 01:59:57,240
an exploit or what you'd call that, but you think if it was unintended, they would have

2517
01:59:57,240 --> 01:59:58,760
patched it out of the game by now, I think.

2518
01:59:58,760 --> 02:00:00,360
But I thought that was kind of an interesting thing.

2519
02:00:00,360 --> 02:00:02,440
So, all right.

2520
02:00:04,840 --> 02:00:07,720
Let's move on and talk about some other quick stories.

2521
02:00:07,720 --> 02:00:12,520
So last week we had the Microsoft press conference and y'all know, I was very excited about fantasy

2522
02:00:12,520 --> 02:00:14,200
star online too.

2523
02:00:14,200 --> 02:00:18,440
And some people were a little bit like, I don't want to get an X-Box and my PC isn't

2524
02:00:18,440 --> 02:00:20,920
good enough to play fantasy star online too.

2525
02:00:20,920 --> 02:00:21,880
Am I just screwed?

2526
02:00:22,040 --> 02:00:24,920
And at the time it seemed like the answer was yes.

2527
02:00:24,920 --> 02:00:31,640
However, apparently X-Box boss Phil Spencer confirmed to giant bomb in an interview that

2528
02:00:31,640 --> 02:00:36,120
fantasy star online too, will end up on all platforms.

2529
02:00:37,160 --> 02:00:41,000
Doesn't say necessarily it'd be the exact same time, but that they do plan to put PSO

2530
02:00:41,000 --> 02:00:42,200
2 on all platforms.

2531
02:00:42,200 --> 02:00:45,480
Yeah, at least they, I don't know, at least he brought that up.

2532
02:00:45,480 --> 02:00:46,920
He didn't have to do that.

2533
02:00:46,920 --> 02:00:47,880
Yeah, no, he didn't have to.

2534
02:00:47,880 --> 02:00:50,920
And again, that's kind of one of those things where like Phil Spencer's a cool dad, you

2535
02:00:50,920 --> 02:00:51,240
know what I mean?

2536
02:00:51,240 --> 02:00:52,680
Which by the way, happy father's day, Loki.

2537
02:00:52,680 --> 02:00:55,480
I should, I forgot to say that at the top of the show, it was up here and then I totally

2538
02:00:55,480 --> 02:00:56,200
forgot to say anything.

2539
02:00:56,200 --> 02:00:56,840
We got derailed.

2540
02:00:56,840 --> 02:00:58,360
So happy father's day.

2541
02:00:58,360 --> 02:01:00,280
Thank you to you and Phil Spencer.

2542
02:01:00,280 --> 02:01:01,080
All right.

2543
02:01:01,080 --> 02:01:05,320
It was just like any other day full of screaming, whining children and then migraines.

2544
02:01:05,320 --> 02:01:06,760
They didn't do anything nice for you today?

2545
02:01:07,800 --> 02:01:09,960
If by giving me a migraine was nice, then no.

2546
02:01:09,960 --> 02:01:10,440
Okay.

2547
02:01:10,440 --> 02:01:10,760
I'm sorry.

2548
02:01:10,760 --> 02:01:11,480
That was fine.

2549
02:01:12,120 --> 02:01:12,520
Whatever.

2550
02:01:12,520 --> 02:01:17,400
I mean, my one son, he made me a little like dish thing.

2551
02:01:17,400 --> 02:01:18,600
I don't really know what it is, but.

2552
02:01:19,000 --> 02:01:23,880
Um, and then my other son, he made something for me, but he left it on the ground.

2553
02:01:23,880 --> 02:01:28,440
And so I assume that that's my gift because it said happy father's day on it, but that's

2554
02:01:28,440 --> 02:01:28,840
fine.

2555
02:01:28,840 --> 02:01:29,720
I don't care.

2556
02:01:29,720 --> 02:01:32,040
I mean, whatever.

2557
02:01:32,040 --> 02:01:38,840
I, I just wish we had one day where they would just behave for like even a little bit, just,

2558
02:01:38,840 --> 02:01:44,520
just for like, not until they're not like 10 minutes, you know, that would be just nice.

2559
02:01:44,520 --> 02:01:46,920
But no, not this week.

2560
02:01:46,920 --> 02:01:47,800
Not until they're 18.

2561
02:01:48,360 --> 02:01:48,840
Anyway.

2562
02:01:48,840 --> 02:01:51,480
Um, so why did they end up doing this?

2563
02:01:51,480 --> 02:01:55,000
Uh, apparently Phil Spencer said simply, I wanted to do something with Sega.

2564
02:01:55,000 --> 02:02:00,200
And, uh, this kind of helped, but they are indicating it could be a timed exclusive.

2565
02:02:00,200 --> 02:02:03,400
So even though probably online too, we'll be coming to the other systems.

2566
02:02:03,400 --> 02:02:04,840
It probably won't be right away.

2567
02:02:04,840 --> 02:02:07,560
So it does seem like there is at least a timed exclusive agreement with that.

2568
02:02:07,560 --> 02:02:12,200
So something to keep in mind, but, and as DJ Rama S is reminding me in chat, and I thought

2569
02:02:12,200 --> 02:02:13,640
I mentioned it, but I'll mention it again.

2570
02:02:13,640 --> 02:02:16,280
Uh, windows PC will also be an option to you.

2571
02:02:16,280 --> 02:02:18,440
So if you do have a PC, that's good enough to play it.

2572
02:02:18,440 --> 02:02:22,200
You don't necessarily have to run out and buy an X-Box just to just part of games pass.

2573
02:02:22,920 --> 02:02:24,520
Um, well, it's going to be free to play.

2574
02:02:24,520 --> 02:02:25,560
So, yeah.

2575
02:02:25,560 --> 02:02:29,640
So it's just depends on how much of the, you know, in game stuff you want to pick up.

2576
02:02:30,200 --> 02:02:35,080
Um, so one thing that was absent from E3, at least in the official press conference

2577
02:02:35,080 --> 02:02:38,120
capacity and the direct was the Nintendo 3DS.

2578
02:02:38,760 --> 02:02:41,720
It was, yeah, I have to admit, I kind of had a similar reaction.

2579
02:02:41,720 --> 02:02:43,960
Look, don't misinterpret me.

2580
02:02:43,960 --> 02:02:45,240
I love the 3DS.

2581
02:02:45,240 --> 02:02:46,440
It's a great system.

2582
02:02:46,440 --> 02:02:47,560
It's just time to move on.

2583
02:02:47,560 --> 02:02:51,000
It's just time to move on to the Nintendo switch, which is a great portable system.

2584
02:02:51,000 --> 02:02:53,400
But Nintendo does want to emphasize.

2585
02:02:53,400 --> 02:02:55,160
The 3DS is not dead.

2586
02:02:55,160 --> 02:02:58,920
Doug Bowser, the new president, which we, I think very clearly saw in that direct.

2587
02:02:58,920 --> 02:03:01,640
We didn't talk about a little joke at the beginning, but it was silly.

2588
02:03:01,640 --> 02:03:04,280
It was, where would you, Doug Bowser did a good job, right?

2589
02:03:04,280 --> 02:03:04,680
I think he did fine.

2590
02:03:04,680 --> 02:03:05,880
He's got some big shoes to fill.

2591
02:03:05,880 --> 02:03:06,920
I think he did a fine job.

2592
02:03:06,920 --> 02:03:08,520
It's hard to fill Reggie's shoes.

2593
02:03:08,520 --> 02:03:08,840
It is.

2594
02:03:08,840 --> 02:03:12,200
It's a very hard job, but I love, I like that they use the humor a little bit to kind of,

2595
02:03:12,200 --> 02:03:13,880
you know, show that he's got a sense of humor.

2596
02:03:13,960 --> 02:03:16,520
It's not just going to be some dry CEO taking over.

2597
02:03:16,520 --> 02:03:18,760
I think it's a good thing, or excuse me, president taking over.

2598
02:03:19,480 --> 02:03:24,840
Anyway, Doug Bowser did mention that the 3DS still has plenty of support from consumers

2599
02:03:24,840 --> 02:03:25,640
in retail.

2600
02:03:25,640 --> 02:03:30,200
So even though he said at this point, we have no games to announce on the 3DS at E3.

2601
02:03:30,200 --> 02:03:34,680
In fact, we're not really showing 3DS content here because it's all about the Nintendo switch,

2602
02:03:34,680 --> 02:03:37,880
but our 3DS business continues to do quite well.

2603
02:03:37,880 --> 02:03:40,760
Retailers continue to support both the hardware and the software.

2604
02:03:40,760 --> 02:03:45,240
And as long as there's consumer demand for 3DS, we'll continue to support it.

2605
02:03:45,240 --> 02:03:49,720
In fact, we belay believe it's a great entry point for young gamers.

2606
02:03:50,360 --> 02:03:54,760
So I imagine the 3DS will continue to be a third party supported.

2607
02:03:54,760 --> 02:03:55,960
Like, I don't know.

2608
02:03:55,960 --> 02:03:59,880
What's the modern equivalent of Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen go shopping and those types

2609
02:03:59,880 --> 02:04:00,380
of games.

2610
02:04:00,920 --> 02:04:05,320
Barbie, let's ride horse creator, pretty, you know, those types of things that are more

2611
02:04:05,320 --> 02:04:06,120
geared to kids.

2612
02:04:06,120 --> 02:04:07,480
What are like the modern equivalent of that?

2613
02:04:07,480 --> 02:04:09,960
The modern equivalent of that, just like movie tie-in games.

2614
02:04:10,040 --> 02:04:13,960
They've got one for like weird dolls or some odd dolls, or I don't know what the movie

2615
02:04:13,960 --> 02:04:15,000
is adventure time.

2616
02:04:15,000 --> 02:04:16,680
I would say adventure time games.

2617
02:04:16,680 --> 02:04:19,320
But I'm like, I know of a lot of adults who get high adventure times.

2618
02:04:19,320 --> 02:04:21,960
Not bad, but yeah.

2619
02:04:21,960 --> 02:04:25,160
So things that, you know, are a little more aimed at kids, Nickelodeon games, I guess

2620
02:04:25,160 --> 02:04:28,680
we'll leave it at that Nickelodeon games, you know, and that type of thing.

2621
02:04:28,680 --> 02:04:32,760
So it seems like there might still be, but Nintendo themselves doesn't seem like they're

2622
02:04:32,760 --> 02:04:34,760
looking to do anything official on the 3DS right now.

2623
02:04:34,760 --> 02:04:38,440
So you will just have to play one of the hundreds of games that already exist for the 3DS.

2624
02:04:38,440 --> 02:04:40,360
If you're looking for something like that.

2625
02:04:40,360 --> 02:04:42,040
So, all right.

2626
02:04:42,040 --> 02:04:46,760
Anyhow, a mistake theory in our chat at twitch.tv slash vog network says, Barbie, let's ride

2627
02:04:46,760 --> 02:04:49,800
horse creator 3D remastered this fall on the PS4.

2628
02:04:51,000 --> 02:04:55,400
Man, that was the one Xbox game I was hoping to see on Xbox one.

2629
02:04:56,280 --> 02:04:56,680
Anyway.

2630
02:04:59,800 --> 02:05:02,760
Dark Tetsuya says apparently one of the SpongeBob games is getting a remaster.

2631
02:05:02,760 --> 02:05:03,480
Who would have thought?

2632
02:05:03,480 --> 02:05:03,800
Yeah.

2633
02:05:03,800 --> 02:05:04,200
Who would have?

2634
02:05:04,200 --> 02:05:05,400
Battle for Bikini Bottom.

2635
02:05:05,400 --> 02:05:06,120
Yeah.

2636
02:05:06,120 --> 02:05:06,920
Okay.

2637
02:05:06,920 --> 02:05:07,560
All right.

2638
02:05:07,560 --> 02:05:08,200
Let's move on.

2639
02:05:08,200 --> 02:05:11,000
Let's travel around the world and check out some games that are going to be releasing

2640
02:05:11,000 --> 02:05:12,760
a little sooner than a SpongeBob remaster.

2641
02:05:12,760 --> 02:05:17,240
As we check out world release date starting in the U S blaster master zero on PC this

2642
02:05:17,240 --> 02:05:17,800
week.

2643
02:05:17,800 --> 02:05:18,200
Cool.

2644
02:05:18,200 --> 02:05:20,920
And I can't believe it, but we're at this point.

2645
02:05:20,920 --> 02:05:26,840
Finally, bloodstain ritual of the night coming out on PC PlayStation for Xbox one.

2646
02:05:28,200 --> 02:05:30,920
Not the switch because that's next week or the week after.

2647
02:05:30,920 --> 02:05:35,640
Supposedly I'm getting a copy of that, but like I filled out that backer survey like

2648
02:05:35,720 --> 02:05:36,920
three years ago.

2649
02:05:36,920 --> 02:05:39,160
And I guess I'm still getting it.

2650
02:05:39,160 --> 02:05:41,640
Like I don't, I don't think I get a physical copy.

2651
02:05:41,640 --> 02:05:42,920
I think I get a digital copy.

2652
02:05:42,920 --> 02:05:45,960
I feel like it was on PS4, but I moved it to the switch.

2653
02:05:45,960 --> 02:05:47,000
I feel like that was the thing I did.

2654
02:05:47,000 --> 02:05:51,640
Like, I don't even know you guys, this game I gave money to like six years ago.

2655
02:05:51,640 --> 02:05:55,720
I finally get my, my, uh, my payback on that, I guess.

2656
02:05:55,720 --> 02:05:58,360
But I might have to wait one more week if I did ask for the switch version.

2657
02:05:58,360 --> 02:05:58,840
Yeah.

2658
02:05:58,840 --> 02:06:04,920
There's a game called, uh, 19, eight X that's on PC and PlayStation four.

2659
02:06:04,920 --> 02:06:12,120
My friend Pedro on the PC and switch, uh, super niche, Neptunia RPG on PC and Yakuza

2660
02:06:12,120 --> 02:06:14,760
five on PlayStation four.

2661
02:06:14,760 --> 02:06:16,680
And then actually I'm just checking real quick.

2662
02:06:16,680 --> 02:06:17,880
See, this is part of the week.

2663
02:06:17,880 --> 02:06:18,040
Yep.

2664
02:06:18,040 --> 02:06:19,400
Apparently this is still part of the week.

2665
02:06:19,400 --> 02:06:25,080
So we've got crash team racing nitro field on Nintendo switch PlayStation four and Xbox

2666
02:06:25,080 --> 02:06:25,640
one.

2667
02:06:25,640 --> 02:06:26,600
That's it.

2668
02:06:26,600 --> 02:06:27,320
All right.

2669
02:06:27,320 --> 02:06:31,480
Traveling over to Japan and checking out some of the releases on the PlayStation four to

2670
02:06:31,480 --> 02:06:31,880
start.

2671
02:06:31,880 --> 02:06:39,560
We have on June 20th from Sega Ryu Ga Gotoku five Yume Kanaishi mono remaster is coming

2672
02:06:39,560 --> 02:06:40,200
out this week.

2673
02:06:40,200 --> 02:06:41,400
That is a Sega game.

2674
02:06:41,400 --> 02:06:42,360
Yakuza five.

2675
02:06:42,360 --> 02:06:44,040
Is that, Oh, that's what is Yakuza five.

2676
02:06:44,040 --> 02:06:46,040
Uh, yeah, of course, of course you just five.

2677
02:06:46,040 --> 02:06:50,280
Uh, and then ease eight, uh, Lacrimosa of Dana is getting a price reduction.

2678
02:06:50,280 --> 02:06:52,120
I was like, I thought that ease game was already out.

2679
02:06:52,120 --> 02:06:52,280
Yeah.

2680
02:06:52,280 --> 02:06:54,360
So that's just a price reduction that we get in Japan.

2681
02:06:54,360 --> 02:06:58,120
Dead by daylight survivor edition, uh, gets a release in Japan.

2682
02:06:58,120 --> 02:06:59,720
I think they probably already had dead by daylight.

2683
02:06:59,720 --> 02:07:01,560
This is probably like a DLC type thing.

2684
02:07:01,560 --> 02:07:06,040
And then, um, some new peripherals, like a new headset and things of that sort.

2685
02:07:06,040 --> 02:07:10,120
So that's what you get on the PlayStation four on the Nintendo switch this week, a game

2686
02:07:10,120 --> 02:07:11,640
called summer pockets.

2687
02:07:11,640 --> 02:07:13,560
Oh, and this must be the big release this week.

2688
02:07:13,560 --> 02:07:15,320
Yo-kai watch four.

2689
02:07:15,320 --> 02:07:17,800
We're looking up at the same sky.

2690
02:07:17,800 --> 02:07:19,960
I should point out that as a switch release.

2691
02:07:19,960 --> 02:07:23,720
So speaking of the three DS kind of moving on from that, those Yo-kai watch games were

2692
02:07:23,720 --> 02:07:25,320
all in the three DS previously.

2693
02:07:25,320 --> 02:07:27,640
So this will be the first one that's on the switch.

2694
02:07:27,640 --> 02:07:32,120
And I imagine, um, some people very much looking forward to that one kind of surprised

2695
02:07:32,120 --> 02:07:34,920
that didn't make its way to a Nintendo direct here.

2696
02:07:34,920 --> 02:07:36,760
Did those games just kind of flop here?

2697
02:07:36,760 --> 02:07:38,760
I thought the first one at least did pretty well.

2698
02:07:38,760 --> 02:07:39,320
I don't know.

2699
02:07:39,320 --> 02:07:39,800
Huh?

2700
02:07:39,800 --> 02:07:41,720
I wonder if they're still going to translate that here.

2701
02:07:41,720 --> 02:07:42,520
I would think so.

2702
02:07:42,520 --> 02:07:46,360
Especially, especially with the fact that the switch is doing pretty well, you would

2703
02:07:46,360 --> 02:07:48,360
think so, but, uh, I guess we'll see.

2704
02:07:48,920 --> 02:07:49,320
All right.

2705
02:07:49,960 --> 02:07:55,000
Anyway, um, mistake theory and chat says the Yo-kai watch switch game looks beautiful.

2706
02:07:55,000 --> 02:07:57,960
It puts the new Pokemon to shame visually at least.

2707
02:07:57,960 --> 02:08:01,160
And Akuma JP is letting out a yes in the chat room.

2708
02:08:01,160 --> 02:08:03,640
I know those, those games are much bigger in Japan than they are here.

2709
02:08:03,640 --> 02:08:05,240
They tried to make it a thing here.

2710
02:08:05,240 --> 02:08:08,840
Um, and I think that you would actually see the physical toys at Toys R Us.

2711
02:08:08,840 --> 02:08:13,800
And they, you know, giving you an indication of how far back we got to go and Toys R Us

2712
02:08:13,800 --> 02:08:17,080
was still around, but, um, you know, and that's more than I can say to most video games.

2713
02:08:17,080 --> 02:08:20,600
So I think, you know, I think they hit a pretty good kid market with that, with that stuff.

2714
02:08:20,600 --> 02:08:24,680
So anyway, um, how about Europe with dark Sakura having left the building?

2715
02:08:24,920 --> 02:08:26,200
Loki, can you cover Europe?

2716
02:08:26,200 --> 02:08:26,520
Yeah.

2717
02:08:26,520 --> 02:08:30,200
So I mentioned this last week, but I guess it's been delayed a couple of days, but Leisure

2718
02:08:30,200 --> 02:08:31,800
Suit Larry wet dreams don't dry.

2719
02:08:31,800 --> 02:08:36,200
That's coming out on PlayStation four and Nintendo switch, uh, the Sims four Island

2720
02:08:36,200 --> 02:08:38,120
living out on PC.

2721
02:08:38,120 --> 02:08:41,720
That expansion there, uh, ever space stellar edition.

2722
02:08:41,720 --> 02:08:44,680
That's coming out on PlayStation four.

2723
02:08:44,680 --> 02:08:50,040
We've got a double pack of far cry five and far cry four that's on PlayStation four and

2724
02:08:50,040 --> 02:08:54,040
Xbox one bloodstain ritual of the night coming out over there as well.

2725
02:08:54,040 --> 02:09:00,360
PlayStation four, Xbox one and the switch, uh, Nippon marathon on PlayStation four and

2726
02:09:00,360 --> 02:09:09,160
the switch, uh, Valfyria arc hero school story on Nintendo switch Rico on PlayStation four

2727
02:09:09,160 --> 02:09:14,600
and Nintendo switch, uh, and crash team racing nitro fueled out on PlayStation four, Xbox

2728
02:09:14,600 --> 02:09:15,640
one and Nintendo switch.

2729
02:09:16,440 --> 02:09:20,600
Uh, pixel pockets in our chat says I hate the name of the newest Leisure Suit Larry

2730
02:09:20,600 --> 02:09:21,240
so much.

2731
02:09:22,120 --> 02:09:24,920
Well, yeah, they're, they're all pretty gross to be fair.

2732
02:09:24,920 --> 02:09:30,760
It's, I guess kind of the point, but I, I kind of hear that name and I go, uh, okay.

2733
02:09:30,760 --> 02:09:33,240
I make that same universal sound of disgust.

2734
02:09:33,240 --> 02:09:35,240
Uh, anyway.

2735
02:09:36,120 --> 02:09:36,840
All right.

2736
02:09:36,840 --> 02:09:38,760
Uh, let's get to the mailbag, shall we?

2737
02:09:38,760 --> 02:09:43,400
Uh, every week we invite you guys to email us, participate at orange lounge radio.com.

2738
02:09:43,400 --> 02:09:45,560
And we read some of these emails here on the show.

2739
02:09:46,120 --> 02:09:48,520
Uh, first email tonight from Garth Wolf.

2740
02:09:48,520 --> 02:09:49,720
Hello, O L R.

2741
02:09:49,720 --> 02:09:54,120
So I have to know has Julian, uh, which you guys don't know.

2742
02:09:54,120 --> 02:09:57,000
Um, that is, uh, dark soccer is BFF Becky.

2743
02:09:57,000 --> 02:10:01,480
Her kid is Julian and not the, not the animal crossing care we referenced earlier.

2744
02:10:01,480 --> 02:10:01,980
Yes.

2745
02:10:02,040 --> 02:10:03,240
Uh, different one.

2746
02:10:03,240 --> 02:10:06,840
Um, but he's gotta be like 12 now, 13 almost.

2747
02:10:06,840 --> 02:10:07,160
I don't know.

2748
02:10:07,160 --> 02:10:08,120
He's, he's getting older.

2749
02:10:08,120 --> 02:10:12,360
So anyway, uh, the question is, has Julian heard Carly Rae Jepsen's new album?

2750
02:10:12,360 --> 02:10:14,760
Is he absolutely living for track one?

2751
02:10:15,480 --> 02:10:17,320
Let me translate to heterosexual.

2752
02:10:17,320 --> 02:10:17,820
Okay.

2753
02:10:19,240 --> 02:10:23,160
Track one on Carly Rae Jepsen's new album is called Julian.

2754
02:10:23,160 --> 02:10:25,160
And it's a bop as the kids would say.

2755
02:10:25,160 --> 02:10:26,920
So it's a, it's a fun little song.

2756
02:10:26,920 --> 02:10:29,560
So the question is, has Julian heard the song Julian?

2757
02:10:29,560 --> 02:10:30,440
We don't know.

2758
02:10:30,440 --> 02:10:33,800
Um, but we will pass that question along to Becky and get back to you.

2759
02:10:33,800 --> 02:10:38,120
But now I want to know, since we brought up earlier in the show that there is an animal

2760
02:10:38,120 --> 02:10:40,040
crossing character named Julian.

2761
02:10:40,040 --> 02:10:43,240
What I want to know is, does Julian know about Julian and animal crossing?

2762
02:10:43,240 --> 02:10:47,320
And do they listen to Julian by Carly Rae Jepsen while they play animal crossing?

2763
02:10:47,320 --> 02:10:49,480
We'll ask these hard hitting questions and get back to you.

2764
02:10:50,120 --> 02:10:51,640
All right, moving on.

2765
02:10:53,000 --> 02:10:56,120
One more email here from Frodo Swagons.

2766
02:10:57,000 --> 02:11:01,480
Again, and if you want to email us for a future week, participate at orangeloungeradio.com.

2767
02:11:01,480 --> 02:11:03,560
Hey, OLR Frodo Swagons here.

2768
02:11:03,560 --> 02:11:07,000
So I've really been having an itch to play at MMO lately.

2769
02:11:07,000 --> 02:11:09,720
I was thinking about getting into Elder Scrolls online.

2770
02:11:09,720 --> 02:11:12,440
I was doing some research and I guess with all the expansions,

2771
02:11:12,440 --> 02:11:14,440
some are saying that the game is in its prime.

2772
02:11:14,440 --> 02:11:16,040
I played the heck out of Skyrim.

2773
02:11:16,040 --> 02:11:17,720
So I think this might be up my alley.

2774
02:11:17,720 --> 02:11:19,880
Do any of you have any experience with ESO?

2775
02:11:20,520 --> 02:11:24,920
Also beyond ESO, are there any MMOs you could recommend me trying out?

2776
02:11:24,920 --> 02:11:27,480
And that is again from Frodo Swagons.

2777
02:11:27,480 --> 02:11:29,240
I have played a little bit of ESO.

2778
02:11:29,240 --> 02:11:32,280
I will admit my experience when I played it was not great,

2779
02:11:32,280 --> 02:11:35,160
but I think it's because I played it the week that it went.

2780
02:11:35,160 --> 02:11:39,240
It's not free to play, but it lost the subscription fee on PlayStation four.

2781
02:11:39,240 --> 02:11:41,000
It went for like the Guild Wars model.

2782
02:11:41,000 --> 02:11:41,240
Yeah.

2783
02:11:41,240 --> 02:11:43,800
Once you buy the game, then you pretty much like own it.

2784
02:11:43,800 --> 02:11:47,000
I only played it in beta and I just, I was expecting Skyrim.

2785
02:11:47,000 --> 02:11:47,800
I didn't get Skyrim.

2786
02:11:47,800 --> 02:11:48,760
So I was like, meh.

2787
02:11:48,760 --> 02:11:49,960
So I think that's important to know.

2788
02:11:49,960 --> 02:11:51,480
ESO is not Skyrim.

2789
02:11:51,480 --> 02:11:57,720
But that being said, the people that are into it that I know really seem to be into it.

2790
02:11:57,720 --> 02:12:01,480
So it's worth checking out if you like Skyrim.

2791
02:12:01,480 --> 02:12:06,120
There is no monthly fee, which, you know, obviously the big MMO players right now,

2792
02:12:06,120 --> 02:12:09,720
World of Warcraft and Final Fantasy 14, they do have monthly fees.

2793
02:12:09,720 --> 02:12:13,400
But otherwise there's a lot out there that's either buy once

2794
02:12:13,400 --> 02:12:15,000
or just straight up free to play.

2795
02:12:15,000 --> 02:12:15,480
Right.

2796
02:12:15,480 --> 02:12:16,520
Guild Wars 2.

2797
02:12:16,520 --> 02:12:18,040
Guild Wars 2 is a buy once.

2798
02:12:18,040 --> 02:12:20,520
Star Trek Online is free to play.

2799
02:12:20,520 --> 02:12:23,400
I don't know if you're, I don't know, like what your tastes are completely.

2800
02:12:23,400 --> 02:12:25,880
I mean, you like Skyrim, but if sci-fi is up your alley,

2801
02:12:25,880 --> 02:12:28,520
I played Star Trek Online for a hot minute and I thought it was pretty fun.

2802
02:12:28,520 --> 02:12:29,640
And that was way back in the beginning.

2803
02:12:29,640 --> 02:12:32,760
I kind of want to, you know, so many games, so little time, right?

2804
02:12:32,760 --> 02:12:33,320
Yeah.

2805
02:12:33,320 --> 02:12:33,640
Yeah.

2806
02:12:33,640 --> 02:12:36,360
Same DC Universe was another one like that.

2807
02:12:36,360 --> 02:12:37,480
That played like going.

2808
02:12:37,480 --> 02:12:39,240
I think so that played like a beat them up.

2809
02:12:39,240 --> 02:12:40,920
And that, uh, that was, that was fun.

2810
02:12:41,480 --> 02:12:46,520
Um, I, you know, my answer, I'm going to encourage you to check out Final Fantasy 14.

2811
02:12:46,520 --> 02:12:48,200
I think it's great, but it does have a month.

2812
02:12:48,200 --> 02:12:50,760
World of Warcraft has like the starter thing, doesn't it?

2813
02:12:50,760 --> 02:12:51,000
Yeah.

2814
02:12:51,000 --> 02:12:54,120
You know, and, uh, both those games do have a starter edition.

2815
02:12:54,120 --> 02:12:55,880
So I think that's worth checking out.

2816
02:12:55,880 --> 02:12:58,520
Uh, if you want to, you can just roll free to play.

2817
02:12:58,520 --> 02:13:01,000
You can level a character up to like 35.

2818
02:13:01,000 --> 02:13:06,280
You're limited on like how much gold you can have and who you can send tells to and stuff

2819
02:13:06,280 --> 02:13:11,560
because they don't want gold spammers, just roll, rolling unlimited free accounts.

2820
02:13:11,560 --> 02:13:13,080
That's why there's so many restrictions.

2821
02:13:13,080 --> 02:13:17,240
It's not just to like convince you to buy the game, but they, they have to be careful

2822
02:13:17,240 --> 02:13:20,760
about some of those gold spammers and things like that being, uh, have easy access to make

2823
02:13:20,760 --> 02:13:21,320
a new account.

2824
02:13:21,320 --> 02:13:24,920
So, but I would definitely say download the trial edition of Final Fantasy 14.

2825
02:13:24,920 --> 02:13:28,760
It's available on PlayStation 4 as well as PC or World of Warcraft.

2826
02:13:28,760 --> 02:13:31,720
If you want, if you want to try the behemoth granddaddy of them all.

2827
02:13:32,360 --> 02:13:34,120
World of Warcraft does have a starter edition.

2828
02:13:34,120 --> 02:13:35,080
You can check out as well.

2829
02:13:35,720 --> 02:13:38,040
And right here at the boys geeks network, you know, girls gone.

2830
02:13:38,040 --> 02:13:38,360
Wow.

2831
02:13:38,360 --> 02:13:42,440
Is still going strong and they're still into the game and they talk about it still every

2832
02:13:42,440 --> 02:13:43,080
week rating.

2833
02:13:43,080 --> 02:13:46,760
I know they're still rating and doing progression because I know they've been jumping into that

2834
02:13:46,760 --> 02:13:48,440
classic edition or whatever it is.

2835
02:13:48,440 --> 02:13:49,080
Vanilla.

2836
02:13:49,080 --> 02:13:52,760
I don't know if they've done, I feel like they did do like an episode on it, but until

2837
02:13:52,760 --> 02:13:55,880
that's here, I don't know if it's not out yet.

2838
02:13:56,680 --> 02:13:59,720
Um, but that's also not something I'm anticipating is going to be free to play.

2839
02:13:59,720 --> 02:14:02,120
So it's a little bit outside with this question about, yeah.

2840
02:14:02,120 --> 02:14:04,760
But, um, that will be a thing at some point as well.

2841
02:14:04,760 --> 02:14:07,640
So, um, other comments in chat.

2842
02:14:07,640 --> 02:14:10,840
So quest buster, our chatters want to have their say as well.

2843
02:14:10,840 --> 02:14:13,800
Um, actually, let me start with this comment because you just says, if you want to play

2844
02:14:13,800 --> 02:14:15,400
an MMO, just play Minecraft.

2845
02:14:15,400 --> 02:14:18,440
MMOs are a waste of money, but some of my memos are free to play.

2846
02:14:18,440 --> 02:14:20,040
So you can't really say they're a waste of money.

2847
02:14:20,040 --> 02:14:24,840
Like some, you know, just go into, um, something like steam and just look up free to play.

2848
02:14:24,840 --> 02:14:29,160
And there's a lot of MMOs in there, uh, especially a lot of the stuff that comes over from Korea.

2849
02:14:29,240 --> 02:14:35,320
Um, what's the one, sorry, Apple watch.

2850
02:14:35,320 --> 02:14:36,040
Can't answer that.

2851
02:14:36,040 --> 02:14:36,360
Wow.

2852
02:14:36,360 --> 02:14:40,120
My Apple watch is like suddenly turned on Skynet has possessed my watch.

2853
02:14:40,120 --> 02:14:41,160
Um, anyway, what's that?

2854
02:14:41,160 --> 02:14:46,520
What's that one in Korea that, um, the guys, it has an affiliation with DJ max and has

2855
02:14:46,520 --> 02:14:48,120
that song, but I don't know.

2856
02:14:48,120 --> 02:14:48,840
Sword art.

2857
02:14:48,840 --> 02:14:49,400
Is that it?

2858
02:14:49,400 --> 02:14:49,720
I don't know.

2859
02:14:49,720 --> 02:14:50,600
Anyway.

2860
02:14:50,600 --> 02:14:52,440
Um, Oh, path of exile.

2861
02:14:52,440 --> 02:14:53,560
Pixel pockets calls out.

2862
02:14:53,560 --> 02:14:54,600
That's not really an MMO.

2863
02:14:54,600 --> 02:14:57,240
It's more like a Diablo game, but it's free and it's on all the consoles.

2864
02:14:57,240 --> 02:14:58,280
That's for sure.

2865
02:14:58,280 --> 02:15:01,400
Um, let's see Questbuster does warn careful with the Korean stuff.

2866
02:15:01,400 --> 02:15:04,040
A lot of the big Korean MMOs are massive grind fests.

2867
02:15:04,040 --> 02:15:04,920
Uh, bless.

2868
02:15:04,920 --> 02:15:05,800
That was the name of it.

2869
02:15:05,800 --> 02:15:06,920
Thank you, Shane.

2870
02:15:06,920 --> 02:15:12,680
Um, Questbuster also says ESO just released a new expansion to called elsewhere.

2871
02:15:12,680 --> 02:15:13,720
I hope I said that right.

2872
02:15:13,720 --> 02:15:16,920
Homeland of the Khajiit and introduces a new necromancer class.

2873
02:15:16,920 --> 02:15:18,360
I've also heard the same as Rob.

2874
02:15:18,360 --> 02:15:19,800
People that are playing it seem to like it.

2875
02:15:19,800 --> 02:15:24,920
And if it's come a long way since this rough beta days, uh, and then also brings up the

2876
02:15:24,920 --> 02:15:25,880
Diablo light games.

2877
02:15:25,880 --> 02:15:28,120
Questbuster says there's also warframe.

2878
02:15:28,120 --> 02:15:33,000
If you want something more sci-fi, uh, dark Tetsuya says I should bring up the final fantasy

2879
02:15:33,000 --> 02:15:35,240
14 vanilla thing that was on Twitter.

2880
02:15:35,240 --> 02:15:39,160
I wish I had the video ready to go, but I retweeted it on my personal account at Rob

2881
02:15:39,160 --> 02:15:39,880
Roberts.

2882
02:15:39,880 --> 02:15:45,080
So somebody in an E3 interview or something asked the question of Yoshi P that it didn't

2883
02:15:45,080 --> 02:15:50,040
say because of world of Warcraft of vanilla, but basically was saying since it's been so

2884
02:15:50,040 --> 02:15:54,840
many years, since 1.0, have you ever thought about releasing 1.0 and a version of that

2885
02:15:54,840 --> 02:15:59,240
that people can experience and Yoshi P, he understands enough English where he just starts

2886
02:15:59,240 --> 02:16:01,800
busting up laughing as the question is being asked.

2887
02:16:01,800 --> 02:16:05,640
And then, um, so the translator starts to go and say the thing.

2888
02:16:05,640 --> 02:16:10,280
And then the translator hands the mic over and he just looks at it and he goes nightmare.

2889
02:16:14,840 --> 02:16:17,800
And then everybody laughs because it's true nightmare.

2890
02:16:17,800 --> 02:16:22,360
And, uh, one thing that's also born world of Warcraft vanilla was kind of good for its

2891
02:16:22,360 --> 02:16:23,080
time.

2892
02:16:23,080 --> 02:16:31,720
Final fantasy 4T 1.0, although I guess towards the end of its run, it had some, it had some,

2893
02:16:31,720 --> 02:16:33,880
some inklings of the game that was to come.

2894
02:16:33,880 --> 02:16:37,960
And I think people remember it a little more fondly in its final form, but honestly, guys,

2895
02:16:37,960 --> 02:16:41,320
let them use the resources to keep reinventing the game.

2896
02:16:41,320 --> 02:16:43,240
I think shadowbringers is going to be a lot of fun.

2897
02:16:43,240 --> 02:16:46,200
I'm really looking forward to still holding out for my 11 remaster.

2898
02:16:46,200 --> 02:16:46,700
Yeah.

2899
02:16:47,640 --> 02:16:48,140
Right.

2900
02:16:48,520 --> 02:16:49,480
Someday.

2901
02:16:49,480 --> 02:16:50,120
All right.

2902
02:16:50,120 --> 02:16:54,760
Um, Frodo swaggins says, I noticed you just met some Skynet.

2903
02:16:54,760 --> 02:16:58,200
I don't know much about it besides they just launched a bunch of satellites and it's supposed

2904
02:16:58,200 --> 02:16:59,960
to give people internet worldwide.

2905
02:16:59,960 --> 02:17:02,280
Do you think that will have an impact on the gaming industry?

2906
02:17:02,280 --> 02:17:05,640
Well, the reason why I say Skynet is watch a movie called Terminator 2.

2907
02:17:05,640 --> 02:17:09,000
And it looks like, I'll explain why I said that right kids today.

2908
02:17:10,760 --> 02:17:13,560
Think of, do you know what year Terminator 2 came out?

2909
02:17:13,560 --> 02:17:15,160
It was a long time ago, Loki.

2910
02:17:15,160 --> 02:17:15,800
It's very possible.

2911
02:17:15,800 --> 02:17:18,600
There's been several Terminator movies that have come out since then.

2912
02:17:18,600 --> 02:17:20,840
They have covered Skynet within the last like 10 years.

2913
02:17:20,840 --> 02:17:22,280
Are they worth watching Loki?

2914
02:17:23,560 --> 02:17:24,520
That's what I thought.

2915
02:17:24,520 --> 02:17:25,020
All right.

2916
02:17:25,960 --> 02:17:28,760
The new one is, I mean, I don't know.

2917
02:17:31,240 --> 02:17:34,840
But to take the other part of the question seriously, do you think that'll have an impact

2918
02:17:34,840 --> 02:17:35,800
on the gaming industry?

2919
02:17:35,800 --> 02:17:36,120
Sure.

2920
02:17:36,120 --> 02:17:40,920
If people have internet worldwide, then things like Stadia, you can take a lot more seriously

2921
02:17:40,920 --> 02:17:42,840
as really being able to impact the industry.

2922
02:17:42,840 --> 02:17:45,960
And I think the more accessible the internet becomes, I think that's just going to be a

2923
02:17:45,960 --> 02:17:50,680
better thing just in general for being able to communicate and learn from cultures and

2924
02:17:50,680 --> 02:17:51,400
learn from other people.

2925
02:17:51,400 --> 02:17:52,840
I think that's just going to be a good thing.

2926
02:17:52,840 --> 02:17:56,040
And gaming is just one part of that.

2927
02:17:56,040 --> 02:17:59,160
And Bobby does say, you're thinking of Starlink and not Skynet.

2928
02:17:59,160 --> 02:18:00,840
Skynet is a movie reference.

2929
02:18:00,840 --> 02:18:01,340
You know what?

2930
02:18:02,120 --> 02:18:04,520
I get stuff mixed up all the time.

2931
02:18:04,520 --> 02:18:06,520
And Starlink, we're just having fun.

2932
02:18:06,520 --> 02:18:10,920
And Starlink is a failed toys to life game that had Starfox in it.

2933
02:18:10,920 --> 02:18:11,420
All right.

2934
02:18:11,960 --> 02:18:13,800
Anyway, that was it for our emails tonight.

2935
02:18:13,800 --> 02:18:18,600
Participate at OrangeLoungeTrady.com is the place to send us emails if you have something

2936
02:18:18,600 --> 02:18:20,520
you'd like to ask about in the future.

2937
02:18:21,080 --> 02:18:24,760
We do have a few more stories, things that happened this week that don't necessarily

2938
02:18:24,760 --> 02:18:26,520
relate to the press conferences.

2939
02:18:26,520 --> 02:18:32,200
In fact, one story that they would probably rather that wasn't reported on this week,

2940
02:18:32,200 --> 02:18:33,000
right, Loki?

2941
02:18:33,000 --> 02:18:33,500
Yes.

2942
02:18:34,120 --> 02:18:38,760
So there's been layoffs or potential layoffs with Amazon Game Studios.

2943
02:18:38,760 --> 02:18:44,920
So apparently they are going to be shifting some of the employees or trying to shift some

2944
02:18:44,920 --> 02:18:46,920
of the employees to other positions.

2945
02:18:46,920 --> 02:18:51,240
But if those employees don't find other positions, they're just going to be let go.

2946
02:18:51,800 --> 02:18:56,520
So Amazon Game Studios, they're reorganizing some of the teams to allow us to prioritize

2947
02:18:56,520 --> 02:19:02,040
development of New World and Crucible and new unannounced projects we're excited to

2948
02:19:02,040 --> 02:19:03,160
reveal in the future.

2949
02:19:03,880 --> 02:19:09,160
These moves are a result of regular business planning cycles where we align resources to

2950
02:19:09,160 --> 02:19:11,560
match evolving long range priorities.

2951
02:19:11,560 --> 02:19:15,640
We are working closely with the employees affected by these changes to assist in finding

2952
02:19:15,640 --> 02:19:17,160
new roles within Amazon.

2953
02:19:17,160 --> 02:19:23,640
Amazon is deeply committed to the games and continues to invest heavily in Amazon Game

2954
02:19:23,640 --> 02:19:30,680
Studios, Twitch, Twitch Prime, AWS, and our retail businesses, as well as other areas

2955
02:19:30,680 --> 02:19:31,720
within Amazon.

2956
02:19:32,680 --> 02:19:39,400
So it sounds like kind of like what we had with Blizzard, where they're just kind of

2957
02:19:39,400 --> 02:19:43,480
looking at what's going to be coming in the pipeline and adjusting staff accordingly.

2958
02:19:43,480 --> 02:19:46,600
And then we also heard about that they canceled a project, too, although I guess most of the

2959
02:19:46,600 --> 02:19:48,200
programmers moved to other stuff.

2960
02:19:48,200 --> 02:19:50,680
But maybe, well, we don't know what the project was.

2961
02:19:50,680 --> 02:19:54,200
It could be, well, the start of the whole Starcraft Ghost, quote unquote thing.

2962
02:19:54,200 --> 02:19:55,560
Oh, you mean in this case with Amazon?

2963
02:19:55,560 --> 02:19:56,200
Yeah, yeah.

2964
02:19:56,200 --> 02:19:58,680
Well, I mean, we know Amazon's got that big MMO.

2965
02:19:59,640 --> 02:20:00,360
Honestly, I forgot.

2966
02:20:00,360 --> 02:20:01,720
Of which I completely forgot it.

2967
02:20:01,720 --> 02:20:02,200
Exactly.

2968
02:20:02,200 --> 02:20:02,600
Me, too.

2969
02:20:02,600 --> 02:20:07,000
I hate to say it, but I kind of forgot that that was all a thing until this news about

2970
02:20:07,000 --> 02:20:07,640
the layoffs came out.

2971
02:20:07,640 --> 02:20:11,800
And then I'm like, oh, yeah, Amazon was working on that next big MMO.

2972
02:20:11,800 --> 02:20:16,280
Speaking of one of the previous emails we just had, this next big MMO that they really

2973
02:20:16,280 --> 02:20:17,000
want people to check out.

2974
02:20:17,000 --> 02:20:21,080
And I remember we got a little bit of information on it, but here we are, E3, and Amazon hasn't

2975
02:20:21,080 --> 02:20:21,720
said anything.

2976
02:20:23,240 --> 02:20:25,400
They said that this layoff does not affect that game.

2977
02:20:25,400 --> 02:20:26,920
They are working on these games still.

2978
02:20:26,920 --> 02:20:29,320
It's not that these have been canceled by any means.

2979
02:20:29,320 --> 02:20:31,320
It's other stuff that we hadn't heard about yet.

2980
02:20:31,320 --> 02:20:31,880
Yeah.

2981
02:20:31,880 --> 02:20:33,240
So interesting.

2982
02:20:36,360 --> 02:20:38,040
New World is the name of that MMO.

2983
02:20:38,040 --> 02:20:39,400
Thank you, Quest Buster.

2984
02:20:39,400 --> 02:20:41,800
It had a closed beta earlier this year and then nothing.

2985
02:20:41,800 --> 02:20:43,880
Oh, I didn't even realize it had a closed beta.

2986
02:20:43,880 --> 02:20:45,320
So you would think it's getting close.

2987
02:20:45,320 --> 02:20:48,280
I wonder if Amazon's going to say some more on that.

2988
02:20:48,280 --> 02:20:51,400
Well, our thoughts to those that were affected by the layoff.

2989
02:20:51,400 --> 02:20:55,160
It does sound like at least Amazon's being pretty decent about they gave them notice,

2990
02:20:55,160 --> 02:20:59,640
so they have time to relocate within Amazon and start to look for other work.

2991
02:20:59,640 --> 02:21:03,640
So it wasn't just like they brought them in and said, bye, your insurance is canceled

2992
02:21:03,640 --> 02:21:04,040
tomorrow.

2993
02:21:04,600 --> 02:21:10,360
It sounds like at least for all there's a lot worse ways this could have been handled

2994
02:21:10,360 --> 02:21:13,640
telltale, but it sounds like this one went all right.

2995
02:21:13,640 --> 02:21:14,140
Yeah.

2996
02:21:14,600 --> 02:21:20,600
For as crappy of a situation as it is, it's at least a little bit more of a ramp down

2997
02:21:20,600 --> 02:21:22,520
instead of just a drop off a cliff.

2998
02:21:22,520 --> 02:21:23,560
Yeah, I mean, yeah.

2999
02:21:23,560 --> 02:21:24,680
So all right.

3000
02:21:26,200 --> 02:21:28,040
Anyhow, let's move on.

3001
02:21:28,040 --> 02:21:32,200
Oh, this is kind of interesting about, you know, we love our games.

3002
02:21:32,200 --> 02:21:32,840
At least I do.

3003
02:21:32,840 --> 02:21:35,320
I play just a little bit of Ingress and Pokemon.

3004
02:21:35,320 --> 02:21:41,400
I still I don't know if you saw the coverage of like Minecraft Earth in E3, but they know

3005
02:21:41,400 --> 02:21:42,360
I didn't see any of it.

3006
02:21:42,360 --> 02:21:45,320
They were shown like different outlets were showing some of the stuff.

3007
02:21:45,320 --> 02:21:46,760
I really want to play the game.

3008
02:21:46,760 --> 02:21:47,400
Yeah, let's cool.

3009
02:21:47,400 --> 02:21:51,320
No, I'm I'm pretty much just like what people don't realize as much as people like to tease

3010
02:21:51,320 --> 02:21:54,040
me for playing a lot of Ingress and playing a lot of Pokemon go.

3011
02:21:54,040 --> 02:22:01,000
And rumor, rumor, big are you is that America is getting Harry Potter Wizards Unite this

3012
02:22:01,000 --> 02:22:04,120
week that there's a big event on Tuesday and it's going to launch in America.

3013
02:22:04,120 --> 02:22:09,080
And if that's the case, I apologize to all my Ingress friends, but I'm going to be taking

3014
02:22:09,080 --> 02:22:11,000
that over and split it in the four now.

3015
02:22:11,000 --> 02:22:11,880
Look, here's the thing.

3016
02:22:11,880 --> 02:22:12,840
Here's the thing.

3017
02:22:12,840 --> 02:22:15,080
I'm max level and then summon Ingress.

3018
02:22:15,080 --> 02:22:16,760
So the whole recursion thing, right?

3019
02:22:16,760 --> 02:22:19,080
I've looped through the game and I'm back on level 12.

3020
02:22:19,080 --> 02:22:19,880
I've lapped.

3021
02:22:19,960 --> 02:22:22,760
So which so which house are you going to be?

3022
02:22:22,760 --> 02:22:24,440
You don't I don't think you don't pick out.

3023
02:22:24,440 --> 02:22:25,800
No, it's not PvP.

3024
02:22:25,800 --> 02:22:27,480
It's it's like a PvE game.

3025
02:22:28,040 --> 02:22:30,680
So I think still though, I think you still do get to get Slytherin.

3026
02:22:30,680 --> 02:22:31,640
Of course, I'm picking Slytherin.

3027
02:22:31,640 --> 02:22:33,560
That's not even because of green, but in part.

3028
02:22:33,560 --> 02:22:35,000
But yes, Slytherin for sure.

3029
02:22:35,000 --> 02:22:36,600
Um, if that's an option.

3030
02:22:36,600 --> 02:22:37,320
But here's the thing.

3031
02:22:37,320 --> 02:22:39,240
I'm max level in Ingress.

3032
02:22:39,240 --> 02:22:40,680
I'm max level in Pokemon go.

3033
02:22:40,680 --> 02:22:44,200
I'm I'm just about to hit 30 million XP cumulative.

3034
02:22:44,200 --> 02:22:46,840
So 20 million is when you hit level 40.

3035
02:22:46,840 --> 02:22:47,880
So that'll tell you how much.

3036
02:22:48,520 --> 02:22:51,080
And I don't even play as much Pokemon go as I was.

3037
02:22:51,080 --> 02:22:52,360
I caught two shiny stars.

3038
02:22:52,360 --> 02:22:55,640
I stopped carrying my gotcha with me because I just

3039
02:22:56,360 --> 02:22:58,280
I have trouble setting it up in the car sometimes.

3040
02:22:58,280 --> 02:22:59,640
It runs the battery down way too fast.

3041
02:22:59,640 --> 02:23:03,720
It's just, um, I just don't care enough anymore.

3042
02:23:03,720 --> 02:23:06,200
I'm like, eh, I miss my bonus.

3043
02:23:06,200 --> 02:23:07,240
Yeah, whatever.

3044
02:23:07,240 --> 02:23:08,600
I'll play it sometimes.

3045
02:23:08,600 --> 02:23:10,680
But like I didn't really play this weekend either.

3046
02:23:10,680 --> 02:23:11,000
Yeah.

3047
02:23:11,000 --> 02:23:13,800
Again, and everybody's going like, oh shit in chat.

3048
02:23:13,800 --> 02:23:15,000
Rumor, big rumor.

3049
02:23:15,000 --> 02:23:18,520
But there was something about because tangent time

3050
02:23:18,520 --> 02:23:20,920
before we get to the topic that's actually in the sidebar.

3051
02:23:21,480 --> 02:23:27,080
So, um, apparently Niantic sued these guys that were making a game

3052
02:23:27,080 --> 02:23:30,280
called like Ingress plus plus and Pokemon go plus plus

3053
02:23:30,280 --> 02:23:35,000
that basically had extra utilities and spoofing abilities built into the apps.

3054
02:23:35,000 --> 02:23:39,160
And they were saying, and I, these people that were making the apps

3055
02:23:39,160 --> 02:23:41,800
were saying that they were building it for people who can't,

3056
02:23:42,360 --> 02:23:46,680
who are due to a disability or whatever, can't go out in the real world and play.

3057
02:23:46,680 --> 02:23:53,080
And I'm kind of like, in the real world, there are lots of disability accessible spots.

3058
02:23:53,080 --> 02:23:56,600
And I kind of think that's like a misdirect to make people feel bad

3059
02:23:56,600 --> 02:23:59,240
about what they're really doing, which is the spoofing.

3060
02:23:59,240 --> 02:24:03,560
I, the spoofing is out of control in a lot of these AR games.

3061
02:24:03,560 --> 02:24:04,440
And it needs to be dealt with.

3062
02:24:04,440 --> 02:24:07,800
And so I applaud Niantic for suing this company and they had, they shut down.

3063
02:24:07,800 --> 02:24:08,600
They're gone now.

3064
02:24:08,600 --> 02:24:12,200
The next day they were basically like our legal team has told that, you know,

3065
02:24:12,200 --> 02:24:13,800
they're like, we're going to get sued into oblivion.

3066
02:24:13,800 --> 02:24:15,400
We have shut down basically.

3067
02:24:15,400 --> 02:24:17,000
So that all happened.

3068
02:24:17,000 --> 02:24:22,840
And the question about why now is apparently this company already had,

3069
02:24:22,840 --> 02:24:26,440
because the Harry Potter game is already out in Australia, New Zealand.

3070
02:24:26,440 --> 02:24:27,480
It's been testing there.

3071
02:24:27,480 --> 02:24:31,960
Apparently this company already had its wizard unite plus plus ready to go.

3072
02:24:31,960 --> 02:24:34,920
And so the reason why Niantic did this when they did this is because

3073
02:24:34,920 --> 02:24:38,280
rumor they're doing wizard unite this week in the U S and they

3074
02:24:38,280 --> 02:24:41,080
wanted to get out in front of the cheater train.

3075
02:24:41,080 --> 02:24:42,440
So that way, when the game launches,

3076
02:24:42,440 --> 02:24:44,360
it's not rampant with cheaters in the beginning of the game.

3077
02:24:45,560 --> 02:24:46,360
Interesting, right?

3078
02:24:46,360 --> 02:24:48,440
I'm just glad Niantic's doing something about it.

3079
02:24:48,440 --> 02:24:51,640
So, um, where was I before I got into all that?

3080
02:24:51,640 --> 02:24:52,360
I don't even know.

3081
02:24:52,360 --> 02:24:54,440
So other AR games.

3082
02:24:54,440 --> 02:24:54,680
Yeah.

3083
02:24:54,680 --> 02:24:56,760
SSG, SSG 100 Matt in chat says,

3084
02:24:56,760 --> 02:24:59,320
Ugh, I hate it when spoofers use that as an excuse.

3085
02:24:59,320 --> 02:25:00,120
I do too.

3086
02:25:00,120 --> 02:25:04,440
Like, you know what you're really doing, please, you know?

3087
02:25:04,440 --> 02:25:05,160
And I, yeah.

3088
02:25:05,160 --> 02:25:06,840
And SSG 100 Matt says, don't get me wrong.

3089
02:25:06,840 --> 02:25:09,000
I believe there are people with disabilities that can't play.

3090
02:25:09,000 --> 02:25:11,880
And it does suck that they can't play, but spoofers use this.

3091
02:25:11,880 --> 02:25:14,600
And I would be all for something maybe to make, you know,

3092
02:25:14,600 --> 02:25:17,800
maybe the ball throwing more accessible to somebody or, you know,

3093
02:25:17,800 --> 02:25:19,720
making some tweaks doing, you know,

3094
02:25:19,720 --> 02:25:21,640
different types of things that we can do within the game.

3095
02:25:21,640 --> 02:25:26,360
But I, I think you still need to be able to go out in the real world and,

3096
02:25:26,360 --> 02:25:27,160
you know, play.

3097
02:25:27,160 --> 02:25:30,280
And, um, yeah, I think that's, that's what it is for me.

3098
02:25:30,920 --> 02:25:31,240
All right.

3099
02:25:31,960 --> 02:25:36,200
Anyhow, going on to other AR games that have nothing to do with Niantic's

3100
02:25:36,200 --> 02:25:38,360
wheelhouse, but we got on that tangent anyway.

3101
02:25:38,360 --> 02:25:40,760
So Netflix announced some other games as well.

3102
02:25:40,760 --> 02:25:42,840
Some stranger things based games.

3103
02:25:42,840 --> 02:25:45,640
Apparently there's like a Fortnite stranger things collaboration happening.

3104
02:25:45,640 --> 02:25:48,280
I had no idea that was a thing, but of course it's a thing because Fortnite.

3105
02:25:48,280 --> 02:25:49,640
They collaborated with everything.

3106
02:25:49,640 --> 02:25:50,600
Yeah, why not?

3107
02:25:50,600 --> 02:25:55,720
But, um, apparently there is a Pokemon go style, but see when the media calls

3108
02:25:55,720 --> 02:25:58,760
it that I go, it doesn't mean that you're going to like throw a ball and

3109
02:25:58,760 --> 02:26:01,240
catch, you know, Demi Gorgon.

3110
02:26:01,240 --> 02:26:04,280
And yeah, I don't think it's going to be like Tessa Hydra,

3111
02:26:04,280 --> 02:26:08,040
but it's a location based game called stranger things, mobile game

3112
02:26:08,040 --> 02:26:09,720
for Android and iOS.

3113
02:26:09,720 --> 02:26:12,200
And of course it revolves around the upside down.

3114
02:26:12,200 --> 02:26:16,040
Now that part I get is that like, Oh, so like, depending on where you are

3115
02:26:16,040 --> 02:26:19,160
on the phone, you're in the upside down, I would think is the logical,

3116
02:26:19,160 --> 02:26:20,440
Oh, that's how it's going to work.

3117
02:26:20,440 --> 02:26:23,000
So maybe you do battle the Demi Gorgons and all this stuff,

3118
02:26:23,000 --> 02:26:25,240
but where they're at is kind of a real world.

3119
02:26:25,240 --> 02:26:25,560
I don't know.

3120
02:26:25,560 --> 02:26:25,960
We'll see.

3121
02:26:25,960 --> 02:26:26,600
We'll see.

3122
02:26:26,600 --> 02:26:30,040
Um, but anyway, the game revolves around the upside down and it's all hidden

3123
02:26:30,040 --> 02:26:31,960
all around you and what you do day to day.

3124
02:26:31,960 --> 02:26:35,400
And you have to work together with friends to overcome the evils that

3125
02:26:35,400 --> 02:26:36,760
are escaping from the upside down.

3126
02:26:36,760 --> 02:26:37,960
It's due next year.

3127
02:26:37,960 --> 02:26:41,880
It's being made by next games who made our world, which is the walking

3128
02:26:41,880 --> 02:26:45,640
dead location game, which is like one of the few that I haven't played.

3129
02:26:45,640 --> 02:26:47,480
Cause I'm just not super into the walking dead.

3130
02:26:47,480 --> 02:26:49,560
Cause I'm just not super into zombie stuff.

3131
02:26:49,560 --> 02:26:52,440
Um, anymore like the old stuff's fine.

3132
02:26:52,440 --> 02:26:55,240
But anyway, um, there's also another game that's coming out called

3133
02:26:55,240 --> 02:26:58,600
stranger three things, three, the game, uh, that ties into the third

3134
02:26:58,600 --> 02:27:01,800
season of the TV show, like retro looking game that comes out July

3135
02:27:01,800 --> 02:27:02,200
2nd.

3136
02:27:02,200 --> 02:27:05,400
But this is all well, and this is all a reminder that stranger things

3137
02:27:05,400 --> 02:27:07,400
season three is about to debut on July 4th.

3138
02:27:07,400 --> 02:27:09,320
Cause we're gonna get in July, not October.

3139
02:27:09,320 --> 02:27:11,640
So, uh, cause they didn't do one last year.

3140
02:27:11,640 --> 02:27:12,760
So it's, it's been a while.

3141
02:27:13,400 --> 02:27:15,160
Yeah, I get, yeah, they didn't do one last year.

3142
02:27:15,160 --> 02:27:19,560
So, uh, it's, we had to, we've had to wait since October of 2017 for this.

3143
02:27:19,560 --> 02:27:21,800
Well, that's because the last one took place during Halloween.

3144
02:27:21,800 --> 02:27:23,640
This one takes place, I think around 4th of July.

3145
02:27:23,640 --> 02:27:24,360
So it makes sense.

3146
02:27:24,360 --> 02:27:24,600
Yeah.

3147
02:27:24,600 --> 02:27:27,320
Well, they also might, that might've been a convenient, you know, the way

3148
02:27:27,320 --> 02:27:31,080
they wrote it, but I'm not, you know, the first I binged watched the first

3149
02:27:31,080 --> 02:27:32,680
two seasons, I'll watch this one too.

3150
02:27:32,680 --> 02:27:33,320
Who are we going to get at?

3151
02:27:33,320 --> 02:27:34,440
There's very few TV shows.

3152
02:27:34,440 --> 02:27:37,960
I have this attention span to sit down and watch, but I'll watch it for sure.

3153
02:27:37,960 --> 02:27:38,840
So I'm excited.

3154
02:27:38,840 --> 02:27:39,400
I didn't know.

3155
02:27:39,400 --> 02:27:42,920
I didn't know Netflix put shows out on Blu-ray, but I was at target and they

3156
02:27:42,920 --> 02:27:44,760
were selling the stranger things box set.

3157
02:27:44,760 --> 02:27:47,160
And I was like, but Netflix, okay.

3158
02:27:47,160 --> 02:27:50,360
Wouldn't it cost as much to buy just two months of Netflix?

3159
02:27:50,360 --> 02:27:54,120
I just watched the new season of, um, black mirror too.

3160
02:27:54,120 --> 02:27:58,440
Oh, did you, I have not watched it yet, but I can't escape Ashley.

3161
02:27:58,440 --> 02:28:04,040
Oh, you know, though I'm on a roll achieving my goals.

3162
02:28:04,040 --> 02:28:04,840
I just, I love that.

3163
02:28:04,840 --> 02:28:05,400
It's great.

3164
02:28:05,400 --> 02:28:06,360
How they did that.

3165
02:28:06,360 --> 02:28:08,280
That, that one is an interesting episode.

3166
02:28:08,280 --> 02:28:10,120
There's one that has to do with VR.

3167
02:28:10,120 --> 02:28:13,880
That was, um, interesting to say the least.

3168
02:28:15,240 --> 02:28:16,520
So, all right.

3169
02:28:16,520 --> 02:28:20,360
Anyway, uh, let's move on from stranger things AR.

3170
02:28:20,360 --> 02:28:21,720
Cause that won't be until next year.

3171
02:28:21,720 --> 02:28:23,880
Anyway, Loki on a little more serious tone.

3172
02:28:23,880 --> 02:28:24,120
Yeah.

3173
02:28:24,120 --> 02:28:25,400
Let's talk about riot games.

3174
02:28:25,400 --> 02:28:30,520
So riot games is being investigated apparently by the department of fair

3175
02:28:30,520 --> 02:28:36,280
employment and housing, um, in regards to, I guess, on, they had an ongoing

3176
02:28:36,280 --> 02:28:42,040
investigation to alleged gender discrimination and alleged unequal pay

3177
02:28:42,040 --> 02:28:46,360
sexual harassment, sexual assault, retaliation, uh, gender discrimination,

3178
02:28:46,360 --> 02:28:48,680
select a selection and promotion.

3179
02:28:49,560 --> 02:28:53,240
And apparently the investigation began October, 2018.

3180
02:28:54,040 --> 02:28:55,080
Uh, right.

3181
02:28:55,080 --> 02:29:01,880
Says that they have, um, refused to provide the department with adequate

3182
02:29:01,880 --> 02:29:02,920
information.

3183
02:29:02,920 --> 02:29:06,920
Um, or I guess they're saying that, uh, the department is saying that riot

3184
02:29:06,920 --> 02:29:10,360
games has refused to provide them with adequate information.

3185
02:29:10,360 --> 02:29:10,680
Right.

3186
02:29:10,680 --> 02:29:15,480
Of course is saying though that they have, you know, been supplying them with

3187
02:29:15,480 --> 02:29:22,040
tons of information, including 2,500 or, uh, you know, 2,500 pages of documents

3188
02:29:22,040 --> 02:29:24,680
and several thousand lines of pay data so far.

3189
02:29:25,320 --> 02:29:27,960
And, uh, they're responding promptly.

3190
02:29:27,960 --> 02:29:34,120
So we'll have to see how this all shakes up, but, um, yeah, not really a good

3191
02:29:34,120 --> 02:29:34,920
place to be.

3192
02:29:34,920 --> 02:29:35,160
Yeah.

3193
02:29:35,160 --> 02:29:38,680
All I can say is it feels like the situation keeps escalating here for riot.

3194
02:29:38,680 --> 02:29:42,520
I mean, between, you know, now this outside, I mean, you already had the

3195
02:29:42,520 --> 02:29:46,840
problems from within with the employees, you know, doing their protests and

3196
02:29:46,840 --> 02:29:47,480
things.

3197
02:29:47,480 --> 02:29:47,960
I don't know.

3198
02:29:47,960 --> 02:29:51,160
Like could, could this end up ruining the company?

3199
02:29:51,160 --> 02:29:57,960
I mean, it's just, uh, it's not a good base for them, but, um, I mean, it's, I

3200
02:29:57,960 --> 02:30:01,800
wonder if it's just more of kind of an indication of like kind of the whole,

3201
02:30:02,760 --> 02:30:05,880
um, like that whole area.

3202
02:30:05,880 --> 02:30:10,680
And as a whole, like a lot of these big AAA companies, you know, seem to have a

3203
02:30:10,680 --> 02:30:11,960
lot of the same issues.

3204
02:30:11,960 --> 02:30:16,120
I'm wondering if we'll see more fallout with, if it's, this is successful, you

3205
02:30:16,120 --> 02:30:19,160
know, coming from those other companies and maybe a little bit more proactive

3206
02:30:19,160 --> 02:30:24,680
measures on their part to try to like be more inclusive and just like, don't

3207
02:30:24,680 --> 02:30:26,680
like treat everybody with respect.

3208
02:30:26,680 --> 02:30:28,840
Most importantly, you know, don't be a Dick.

3209
02:30:28,840 --> 02:30:29,000
Yeah.

3210
02:30:29,000 --> 02:30:29,720
Don't be a Dick.

3211
02:30:29,720 --> 02:30:31,240
That's very, very simple.

3212
02:30:31,240 --> 02:30:33,240
So, um, all right.

3213
02:30:33,240 --> 02:30:36,120
Uh, let's move on here and talk a little bit about something.

3214
02:30:36,120 --> 02:30:39,800
This is from E3, but I thought this was, um, really cool for, uh, especially

3215
02:30:39,800 --> 02:30:42,280
those collectors that like to get those little arcade cabinets.

3216
02:30:42,280 --> 02:30:45,240
Uh, those little arcade one up cabinets are getting bigger.

3217
02:30:45,240 --> 02:30:46,040
They're getting bigger.

3218
02:30:46,040 --> 02:30:47,720
They got some bigger licenses.

3219
02:30:47,720 --> 02:30:51,960
So they, they, you know, before we had kind of like a lot of the same Atari

3220
02:30:51,960 --> 02:30:53,240
things we've been seeing for a while.

3221
02:30:53,240 --> 02:30:56,120
Then we started to hear about mortal combat trilogy, you know, street

3222
02:30:56,120 --> 02:30:56,920
fighters, pretty cool.

3223
02:30:56,920 --> 02:30:57,160
Yeah.

3224
02:30:57,160 --> 02:30:57,560
Yeah.

3225
02:30:57,560 --> 02:30:59,960
And now, now they're getting some big ones.

3226
02:30:59,960 --> 02:31:02,840
Teenage mutant Ninja turtles, arcade one up.

3227
02:31:02,840 --> 02:31:03,320
That's right.

3228
02:31:03,320 --> 02:31:05,880
With Ninja turtles and turtles in time.

3229
02:31:05,880 --> 02:31:07,800
And it's four players full.

3230
02:31:07,800 --> 02:31:08,120
Awesome.

3231
02:31:08,120 --> 02:31:10,120
So these are those replica arcade cabinets.

3232
02:31:10,120 --> 02:31:13,560
They're not quite as big as an actual arcade cabinet, but they're great for

3233
02:31:13,560 --> 02:31:16,360
like a bar top or, you know, they're, they're pretty, they're pretty big.

3234
02:31:16,360 --> 02:31:16,600
Yeah.

3235
02:31:17,480 --> 02:31:20,680
It's very comparable to what you used to have in here, which by the way is the,

3236
02:31:20,680 --> 02:31:21,960
the coding place.

3237
02:31:21,960 --> 02:31:23,720
Uh, it's in the back room right now.

3238
02:31:23,720 --> 02:31:27,400
Cause they have to filter out some of the games that were on there because

3239
02:31:27,400 --> 02:31:31,320
apparently when I filtered it out, I only did it for the main category.

3240
02:31:31,320 --> 02:31:34,840
But if you go into subcategories, it's all of the games on there.

3241
02:31:34,840 --> 02:31:38,360
And so they need to just, they want to filter it down to it's like several

3242
02:31:38,360 --> 02:31:39,480
thousand games right now.

3243
02:31:39,480 --> 02:31:41,560
They want to just put like a few on there.

3244
02:31:41,560 --> 02:31:42,840
So they are just working on that.

3245
02:31:42,840 --> 02:31:45,320
My favorite thing though, about the Ninja turtles 90s cabinet that they're

3246
02:31:45,320 --> 02:31:49,160
putting out is that they are retaining the 1990s Ninja turtles art complete

3247
02:31:49,160 --> 02:31:54,120
with that April O'Neil, with that, just that wig that she's got that huge red

3248
02:31:54,120 --> 02:31:55,320
wig that she has.

3249
02:31:55,320 --> 02:31:57,640
And that yellow jumpsuit that she's wearing.

3250
02:31:57,640 --> 02:32:02,280
Like it's like, it's some like Evangeline's costume mansion, Halloween

3251
02:32:02,280 --> 02:32:03,320
realness.

3252
02:32:03,320 --> 02:32:05,320
It's going to be, uh, it's, it's great.

3253
02:32:05,320 --> 02:32:06,120
I love it.

3254
02:32:06,120 --> 02:32:09,240
Um, but that's not all the, I keep focusing on Ninja turtles, but there's

3255
02:32:09,240 --> 02:32:09,960
other ones too.

3256
02:32:09,960 --> 02:32:15,160
There's a Marvel superheroes machine with Marvel superheroes, X-Men children

3257
02:32:15,160 --> 02:32:15,960
of the Adam.

3258
02:32:15,960 --> 02:32:16,840
Whoa, that game is huge.

3259
02:32:16,840 --> 02:32:17,720
And the Punisher.

3260
02:32:17,720 --> 02:32:19,560
That's going to be a hell of a cabinet.

3261
02:32:19,560 --> 02:32:23,000
And then, so they announced those and then they announced one more during the

3262
02:32:23,000 --> 02:32:23,240
show.

3263
02:32:23,240 --> 02:32:26,200
And this one, like I had to text my friend melody right away.

3264
02:32:26,200 --> 02:32:30,920
Cause she is a huge fan of star Wars and there's going to be another cabinet

3265
02:32:30,920 --> 02:32:34,680
with star Wars, the empire strikes back and the return of the Jedi.

3266
02:32:34,680 --> 02:32:39,160
All of those Atari vector games, complete with that yolk controller.

3267
02:32:39,160 --> 02:32:40,600
That is bad-ass.

3268
02:32:40,600 --> 02:32:44,520
So, um, it's almost like, I mean, I wish I had the room to just collect

3269
02:32:44,520 --> 02:32:45,000
some of them.

3270
02:32:45,000 --> 02:32:45,160
God.

3271
02:32:45,160 --> 02:32:45,320
Right.

3272
02:32:45,320 --> 02:32:48,440
But these, these are like hundreds of dollars each, but I'm like, Oh my God.

3273
02:32:48,440 --> 02:32:54,520
I see my, my future basement getting nuttier and nuttier with these, uh,

3274
02:32:54,520 --> 02:32:54,920
things.

3275
02:32:54,920 --> 02:32:57,960
I'm surprised they haven't done like replica pinball machines yet.

3276
02:32:57,960 --> 02:33:01,720
I'm curious, careful, careful, careful what you're thinking.

3277
02:33:01,720 --> 02:33:03,800
Cause I bet that might be a future direction they go in.

3278
02:33:03,800 --> 02:33:06,920
I want to know if Bobby Black Wolf has started eyeing these, if he's got a

3279
02:33:06,920 --> 02:33:09,560
little eye on these going, I might have to do this.

3280
02:33:09,560 --> 02:33:15,240
So it was, I I'm curious if any of these newer ones have tempted him.

3281
02:33:15,240 --> 02:33:17,560
Cause I know he's thinking about building his basement arcade at some

3282
02:33:17,560 --> 02:33:17,720
point.

3283
02:33:17,720 --> 02:33:19,560
I think he wants to finish everything you wanted.

3284
02:33:19,560 --> 02:33:21,080
I need to fix up my cabinet.

3285
02:33:21,080 --> 02:33:23,320
They have, cause it, the monitors out on it.

3286
02:33:23,320 --> 02:33:26,680
And the problem is with that is like, it's already blasphemous.

3287
02:33:26,680 --> 02:33:33,640
I painted it black cause it's a SIG Astra city and, um, everyone paints it

3288
02:33:33,640 --> 02:33:35,400
white because it's a white cabinet.

3289
02:33:35,400 --> 02:33:37,320
I wanted to be different and painted black.

3290
02:33:37,320 --> 02:33:39,240
So already it's an outcast.

3291
02:33:39,240 --> 02:33:44,600
But, um, I wanted to get the monitor fixed and I don't know how to exactly

3292
02:33:44,600 --> 02:33:45,240
to do that.

3293
02:33:45,800 --> 02:33:50,760
Um, I may end up having to replace it with an LCD, but you know, they don't

3294
02:33:50,760 --> 02:33:53,080
make four by three LCDs anymore.

3295
02:33:53,080 --> 02:33:58,600
So I may have to do something not so nice and like get a, you know, 16 by

3296
02:33:58,600 --> 02:34:02,760
nine TV and try to shove it in there, uh, which worked okay for my DDR

3297
02:34:02,760 --> 02:34:03,240
machine.

3298
02:34:03,240 --> 02:34:08,760
So, I mean, it would be fine, but, um, I would like to get that working again.

3299
02:34:08,760 --> 02:34:11,960
And just to be clear, Bobby black Wolf does say in our chat room, I might

3300
02:34:11,960 --> 02:34:12,920
get the star Wars one.

3301
02:34:13,560 --> 02:34:15,080
So he's thinking about it.

3302
02:34:15,080 --> 02:34:15,960
He's thinking about it.

3303
02:34:15,960 --> 02:34:17,480
Anyway, just a couple more stories for you guys.

3304
02:34:17,480 --> 02:34:20,120
Then we're going to invite your calls on our discord channel.

3305
02:34:20,120 --> 02:34:23,880
If you want to join the green room, just head over to head over to vog

3306
02:34:23,880 --> 02:34:25,640
network.com slash discord.

That'll get you the invite generated into our discord server and you can join

3308
02:34:29,560 --> 02:34:31,720
and hang head over to the green room.

3309
02:34:31,720 --> 02:34:35,160
And it's also great if you could tell us what you'd like to call in about in

3310
02:34:35,160 --> 02:34:37,480
our channel for orange lounge radio.

3311
02:34:37,480 --> 02:34:40,840
We are running a little long tonight with this being, we got a late start and

3312
02:34:40,840 --> 02:34:42,040
it is knee three episodes.

3313
02:34:42,040 --> 02:34:45,400
So I I'm not like, if there's not people wanting to call in, I'm going to move

3314
02:34:45,400 --> 02:34:48,360
right along, but I do want to give an opportunity for folks to call in.

3315
02:34:48,360 --> 02:34:49,960
We will get to that in just a moment.

3316
02:34:49,960 --> 02:34:52,280
We have a couple more stories for you first before we get there.

3317
02:34:52,280 --> 02:34:52,520
Yeah.

3318
02:34:52,520 --> 02:34:55,960
So there's this game called platigo super platform game maker.

3319
02:34:55,960 --> 02:34:58,280
And it basically is what it sounds like.

3320
02:34:58,280 --> 02:35:03,640
It's sort of like, um, I guess a little bit like Mario maker, a little bit like

3321
02:35:03,640 --> 02:35:06,920
RPG maker in which you can make your own platform games.

3322
02:35:06,920 --> 02:35:11,240
And so what's kind of cool about it is they have, um, it is available now on the

3323
02:35:11,240 --> 02:35:13,160
switch and on steam.

3324
02:35:13,160 --> 02:35:16,520
You can actually make, um, retro games similar.

3325
02:35:16,520 --> 02:35:17,800
They have different like art styles.

3326
02:35:17,800 --> 02:35:22,680
So they have like super Nintendo game boy, Commodore 64 styles, Amiga, you can

3327
02:35:22,680 --> 02:35:24,760
design different traps platforms.

3328
02:35:25,400 --> 02:35:30,520
You can even re you know, create your own custom sprites and everything for the

3329
02:35:30,520 --> 02:35:31,640
games themselves.

3330
02:35:31,640 --> 02:35:32,760
It looks pretty cool.

3331
02:35:32,760 --> 02:35:35,640
Uh, it's like 20 bucks right now on steam.

3332
02:35:35,720 --> 02:35:39,480
I don't know if I would pick this up because I probably wouldn't do anything

3333
02:35:39,480 --> 02:35:41,320
with it or wouldn't finish anything with it.

3334
02:35:41,320 --> 02:35:44,760
And we all know, you know, we all know how that is.

3335
02:35:44,760 --> 02:35:47,000
So, um, but it looks neat.

3336
02:35:47,000 --> 02:35:49,960
Um, I'd be curious to see how you can share out this type of stuff.

3337
02:35:49,960 --> 02:35:53,320
I know they showed in the trailer that you can link your levels together so you

3338
02:35:53,320 --> 02:35:56,840
can make like your whole, make a whole game out of it if you wanted to.

3339
02:35:56,840 --> 02:36:00,840
Um, so I'd be curious to see like how this is shared on there.

3340
02:36:00,840 --> 02:36:04,040
If they have like steam, uh, workshop support or something like that.

3341
02:36:04,040 --> 02:36:04,920
That'd be cool.

3342
02:36:04,920 --> 02:36:08,760
I was looking at, it looks a little Mario maker to me, so it looks pretty easy to

3343
02:36:08,760 --> 02:36:09,080
do.

3344
02:36:09,080 --> 02:36:09,240
Yeah.

3345
02:36:09,240 --> 02:36:12,680
And they've got some sprites that comes with in different enemies already, but you

3346
02:36:12,680 --> 02:36:16,520
can like customize gravity so you can kind of do like a little bit like a VVVV.

3347
02:36:17,080 --> 02:36:19,720
Um, they had different hazards.

3348
02:36:19,720 --> 02:36:22,200
I don't know what the limitations are on there.

3349
02:36:22,200 --> 02:36:25,160
The reviews seem to be pretty positive from what I've seen.

3350
02:36:25,160 --> 02:36:29,960
There were some that, you know, they wish that you can export the game to its own

3351
02:36:29,960 --> 02:36:31,320
executable or something like that.

3352
02:36:31,320 --> 02:36:34,680
So you can, I don't know, sell it or share it or whatever.

3353
02:36:34,760 --> 02:36:37,960
But being that, like you can kind of steal sprites from other things.

3354
02:36:37,960 --> 02:36:38,280
I don't know.

3355
02:36:39,080 --> 02:36:40,600
Let's learn game maker at that point.

3356
02:36:40,600 --> 02:36:44,440
But, um, how long is it going to take before you see a world one, one remake?

3357
02:36:44,440 --> 02:36:44,680
Right.

3358
02:36:44,680 --> 02:36:49,720
Oh, I probably already haven't, but, um, how long before we see a level full of

3359
02:36:49,720 --> 02:36:52,280
dicks, but it's, it's cool to like it for 20 bucks.

3360
02:36:52,280 --> 02:36:52,920
That's not bad.

3361
02:36:52,920 --> 02:36:56,840
I mean, compared to like RPG maker, which is like $70 for that shit.

3362
02:36:56,840 --> 02:36:58,360
You know, you should catch it on a sale, but yeah.

3363
02:36:58,360 --> 02:36:59,000
Yeah, exactly.

3364
02:36:59,000 --> 02:37:01,640
So, um, eh, maybe worth checking out.

3365
02:37:02,200 --> 02:37:02,840
Yeah, for sure.

3366
02:37:03,480 --> 02:37:03,880
All right.

3367
02:37:03,960 --> 02:37:08,440
Well, moving on to one more topic here tonight that has to do with Square Enix.

3368
02:37:08,440 --> 02:37:12,040
And you know, a lot of people very jazzed to hear about that Final Fantasy

3369
02:37:12,040 --> 02:37:17,560
Eight remaster and are wondering, could, could maybe Square want to do a Chrono?

3370
02:37:17,560 --> 02:37:20,440
You want to say the word Chrono in a remaster?

3371
02:37:20,440 --> 02:37:21,400
Well, here's the thing.

3372
02:37:21,400 --> 02:37:26,440
Square Enix does want to make their entire back catalog available digitally.

3373
02:37:26,440 --> 02:37:32,280
That includes things like Rad Racer, 3D World Runner and some of those types of games.

3374
02:37:32,280 --> 02:37:33,320
But here's the catch.

3375
02:37:34,120 --> 02:37:38,760
So Square Enix president and CEO Yosuke Matsuda said in an interview, quote,

3376
02:37:38,760 --> 02:37:40,600
we're working on that in a variety of ways.

3377
02:37:40,600 --> 02:37:43,560
That is a request we hear often as far as our major titles go.

3378
02:37:43,560 --> 02:37:46,600
Most of those, we still have variations out that you can play now.

3379
02:37:46,600 --> 02:37:49,320
God, I would love them to bring back Rad Racer as a franchise.

3380
02:37:49,320 --> 02:37:50,520
We'd be fucking awesome.

3381
02:37:50,520 --> 02:37:53,240
The more classic titles that you might've played on NES,

3382
02:37:53,240 --> 02:37:55,800
we're still working hard to make it so you can play those.

3383
02:37:55,800 --> 02:37:59,400
We actually have launched a dedicated project internally to port those.

3384
02:37:59,400 --> 02:38:02,360
So we're working to make them available on a variety of platforms.

3385
02:38:02,360 --> 02:38:04,760
So at least the old Rad Racer, it sounds like you might be able to play.

3386
02:38:04,760 --> 02:38:07,080
I hope they keep the support for the 3D.

3387
02:38:07,080 --> 02:38:07,960
That would be great.

3388
02:38:07,960 --> 02:38:11,000
If you could find an older retro eighties pair of glasses, that would be great.

3389
02:38:12,680 --> 02:38:17,080
Certainly down the road, we would like to see that on a subscription or streaming service.

3390
02:38:19,400 --> 02:38:22,840
So we're exploring the possibility of creating a dedicated channel for ourselves.

3391
02:38:23,480 --> 02:38:25,560
I think everyone is going in that direction streaming.

3392
02:38:25,560 --> 02:38:28,120
So we do want to be proactive in considering those options.

3393
02:38:28,120 --> 02:38:29,960
We still don't know if it would take a subscription service

3394
02:38:29,960 --> 02:38:32,360
or an exclusive downloading service or what form it might take,

3395
02:38:32,360 --> 02:38:34,040
but we do want to leverage our catalog.

3396
02:38:34,040 --> 02:38:39,400
I'm embarrassed to admit it, but in some cases, we don't know where the code is anymore.

3397
02:38:39,400 --> 02:38:42,040
It's very hard to find them sometimes because back in the day,

3398
02:38:42,040 --> 02:38:44,600
you just made them and put them out there and you were done.

3399
02:38:44,600 --> 02:38:47,400
You didn't think of how you were going to sell them down the road.

3400
02:38:47,400 --> 02:38:50,680
Sometimes customers ask, why haven't you released that game yet?

3401
02:38:50,680 --> 02:38:53,480
And the truth of the matter is it's because we don't know where it's gone.

3402
02:38:54,440 --> 02:38:57,880
And like I believe it, like he's absolutely right.

3403
02:38:57,880 --> 02:38:59,960
Back in the day, it was just get the game out.

3404
02:38:59,960 --> 02:39:01,960
You don't think about, oh yeah, I got to get the game out

3405
02:39:01,960 --> 02:39:06,040
and then I want to release it again in 10 more years and it's remastered.

3406
02:39:06,040 --> 02:39:08,040
People weren't thinking like that back then.

3407
02:39:08,040 --> 02:39:09,960
So which is probably a good thing, right?

3408
02:39:09,960 --> 02:39:12,920
But they weren't necessarily retaining the source code.

3409
02:39:12,920 --> 02:39:18,680
So either they're having to go like reverse compile things or I don't know how they're doing it.

3410
02:39:18,680 --> 02:39:22,360
Or like go find the guy who wrote it and make him remember how he did it

3411
02:39:22,360 --> 02:39:23,880
and that whole type of thing.

3412
02:39:23,880 --> 02:39:27,240
So anyway, by the way, a lot of people in our chat room,

3413
02:39:27,240 --> 02:39:29,640
pipe it up at the whole rad racer thing.

3414
02:39:29,640 --> 02:39:31,160
That would be an awesome, like I would,

3415
02:39:31,160 --> 02:39:34,920
even if Square Enix kind of like gave the ability to do that to somebody else.

3416
02:39:34,920 --> 02:39:38,920
Cause I think they could really do anything they want with rad racer.

3417
02:39:40,920 --> 02:39:43,400
The original rad racer, the kick was 3d, right?

3418
02:39:44,120 --> 02:39:47,080
How about rad racer as a VR Square Enix game?

3419
02:39:49,560 --> 02:39:50,060
Yeah.

3420
02:39:50,700 --> 02:39:53,500
Look, if I'm not going to get my, but yeah, it could be,

3421
02:39:53,500 --> 02:39:55,340
it could be pretty rad racer VR.

3422
02:39:55,340 --> 02:39:56,540
I'd be into that.

3423
02:39:56,540 --> 02:39:57,040
Hell yeah.

3424
02:39:58,460 --> 02:40:00,620
Anyway, um, yeah.

3425
02:40:00,620 --> 02:40:01,980
Act deft and chat says, who knew?

3426
02:40:01,980 --> 02:40:03,740
Retro video games would have been profitable.

3427
02:40:03,740 --> 02:40:04,060
Yeah.

3428
02:40:04,060 --> 02:40:05,340
SSG100 Matt says, yeah.

3429
02:40:05,340 --> 02:40:07,580
Back in the day archiving wasn't a thing.

3430
02:40:07,580 --> 02:40:11,660
Um, DJ Rama S says, I thought they were going to announce rad racer three,

3431
02:40:11,660 --> 02:40:13,100
but that was another racing game.

3432
02:40:13,100 --> 02:40:14,780
Square Enix is a backing.

3433
02:40:14,780 --> 02:40:15,340
Well, yeah, that's right.

3434
02:40:15,340 --> 02:40:16,460
There was a rad racer too.

3435
02:40:16,460 --> 02:40:19,660
I always forget that they, they actually did have a rad racer too at one point,

3436
02:40:19,740 --> 02:40:24,300
but it's, it's, uh, you know, pretty easy to forget that that existed.

3437
02:40:24,300 --> 02:40:24,860
All right.

3438
02:40:24,860 --> 02:40:27,420
Anyhow, uh, let's go to listener round table.

3439
02:40:27,420 --> 02:40:30,380
If you want to give us a call, you can, uh, head on over to our discord server,

3440
02:40:30,380 --> 02:40:31,820
but you want to get over there pretty quickly.

3441
02:40:31,820 --> 02:40:33,340
I'm not going to leave it open long.

3442
02:40:33,340 --> 02:40:36,620
Also, if you have questions in chat, if you're like, eh, it's not really worth calling in.

3443
02:40:36,620 --> 02:40:38,060
I just want to ask this question.

3444
02:40:38,060 --> 02:40:40,220
You can go ahead and put that out in our chat room.

3445
02:40:40,220 --> 02:40:43,100
Uh, and, um, see, we'll, we'll get around to it.

3446
02:40:43,660 --> 02:40:49,020
Bobby Black Wolf does point out the BBC destroyed old shows because they needed the shell space.

3447
02:40:49,020 --> 02:40:52,220
Hence why many early doctor who episodes are lost.

3448
02:40:52,220 --> 02:40:52,460
Yeah.

3449
02:40:52,460 --> 02:40:57,340
They had to either like, like they had to find the one guy in the middle of nowhere who taped it

3450
02:40:57,340 --> 02:41:00,380
or like they, I think there's one episode they stitched together.

3451
02:41:00,380 --> 02:41:05,180
Like they had the audio only because somebody had taped the audio and they stitched it together

3452
02:41:05,180 --> 02:41:06,700
with like production stills or something.

3453
02:41:06,700 --> 02:41:10,140
I think there's an episode like that out there, but the BBC destroyed things.

3454
02:41:10,140 --> 02:41:15,180
There was a big news article this week about how some music masters were lost in universal

3455
02:41:15,180 --> 02:41:18,300
studios fire a few years ago, which is really sad.

3456
02:41:18,300 --> 02:41:18,940
Yeah.

3457
02:41:18,940 --> 02:41:21,900
So anyway, uh, before we get to calls, uh, quickly checking in to see if there's any

3458
02:41:21,900 --> 02:41:27,900
last minute stories, I guess E3 and all that.

3459
02:41:27,900 --> 02:41:28,300
Yeah.

3460
02:41:28,300 --> 02:41:31,500
Kind of a lot of nerve there were, yeah, I hear you.

3461
02:41:31,500 --> 02:41:33,740
Anyway, we do have a call coming in, so let's get to it.

3462
02:41:33,740 --> 02:41:34,860
Hi, you're on orange launch radio.

3463
02:41:34,860 --> 02:41:35,180
Who's this?

3464
02:41:35,740 --> 02:41:36,700
Hey, what's up everyone?

3465
02:41:36,700 --> 02:41:37,500
It's Rama.

3466
02:41:37,500 --> 02:41:37,980
Hey Rama.

3467
02:41:37,980 --> 02:41:38,780
Good to hear from you, buddy.

3468
02:41:38,780 --> 02:41:39,420
What's up, buddy?

3469
02:41:39,420 --> 02:41:39,740
What's up?

3470
02:41:39,740 --> 02:41:40,780
It's good to hear from you too.

3471
02:41:40,780 --> 02:41:45,580
But yeah, I was really hyped for that ride race of three, but it was different, uh, racing

3472
02:41:45,580 --> 02:41:45,820
game.

3473
02:41:46,620 --> 02:41:48,060
I, I would love it.

3474
02:41:48,060 --> 02:41:51,740
If square Enix would revisit that property, they don't even have to call it rad racer

3475
02:41:51,740 --> 02:41:51,980
three.

3476
02:41:51,980 --> 02:41:52,300
Come on.

3477
02:41:52,300 --> 02:41:53,100
It's been this long.

3478
02:41:53,100 --> 02:41:54,380
They can just call it rad racer.

3479
02:41:54,380 --> 02:41:55,660
I think people would lose their minds.

3480
02:41:55,660 --> 02:41:56,220
It'd be awesome.

3481
02:41:57,340 --> 02:41:58,060
Exactly.

3482
02:41:58,060 --> 02:42:01,980
But I called it not to talk about themes or E3 at the moment.

3483
02:42:03,500 --> 02:42:03,900
I'm sorry.

3484
02:42:03,900 --> 02:42:04,460
Say that again.

3485
02:42:05,340 --> 02:42:08,540
I said, I called it not to talk about E3, but something else.

3486
02:42:08,540 --> 02:42:09,020
Oh, okay.

3487
02:42:09,020 --> 02:42:09,340
Sure.

3488
02:42:09,340 --> 02:42:09,840
What?

3489
02:42:11,180 --> 02:42:15,260
Did you see the season premiere of pressure luck and card sharks?

3490
02:42:16,620 --> 02:42:17,740
I haven't yet.

3491
02:42:17,740 --> 02:42:22,140
I'm sorry to let you down, but they're an hour, I guess, and not 30 minutes.

3492
02:42:22,140 --> 02:42:25,420
So I just, I haven't got around to it, but I think they're on, they're on Hulu or something,

3493
02:42:25,420 --> 02:42:25,660
right?

3494
02:42:25,660 --> 02:42:26,620
So I'll get around to it.

3495
02:42:26,620 --> 02:42:32,220
I just, I didn't get to it this last week, but I heard, I heard, um, I heard pressure

3496
02:42:32,220 --> 02:42:34,540
luck was good except for that weird bonus round.

3497
02:42:34,540 --> 02:42:35,420
I guess they have at the end.

3498
02:42:36,060 --> 02:42:37,500
Yeah, that was my main issue.

3499
02:42:37,500 --> 02:42:40,300
That took up like the second half hour of the show.

3500
02:42:41,900 --> 02:42:44,060
Oh God, that's a long bonus round.

3501
02:42:44,940 --> 02:42:49,420
Yeah, basically you have a chance to go up against a big board and you get like six chances,

3502
02:42:49,420 --> 02:42:54,060
but as you make it past six chances, you get four chances and so on and so forth.

3503
02:42:54,060 --> 02:42:58,300
So amass as much money as you can, but if you get the whammy four times, that's it.

3504
02:42:59,260 --> 02:42:59,760
Interesting.

3505
02:43:00,940 --> 02:43:04,060
Well, I mean, I guess they had to think of a way to extend it to an hour, but I mean,

3506
02:43:04,060 --> 02:43:06,300
if 30 minutes works, just keep it at 30 minutes.

3507
02:43:06,300 --> 02:43:10,620
It is, it's, it's tough though, when you're a prime time show, I think there's a certain

3508
02:43:11,260 --> 02:43:17,340
expectation that may have worked a little better in daytime, but, um, I, I, I hear Elizabeth

3509
02:43:17,340 --> 02:43:20,940
Banks is doing a good job as a host since, you know, I think they wanted to go a very,

3510
02:43:20,940 --> 02:43:22,460
very different direction.

3511
02:43:22,460 --> 02:43:24,700
You know, obviously Peter Tamarkin is no longer with us.

3512
02:43:24,700 --> 02:43:26,700
So I think they just wanted to go a really different direction.

3513
02:43:26,700 --> 02:43:29,820
It sounds like they, they got a good result with, um, Elizabeth Banks.

3514
02:43:30,540 --> 02:43:32,220
Yeah, she was pretty sassy.

3515
02:43:32,220 --> 02:43:33,500
You'd be proud.

3516
02:43:33,500 --> 02:43:34,460
Good, good.

3517
02:43:34,460 --> 02:43:37,740
And then, uh, Card Sharks, uh, look, I heard it was a lot of fun.

3518
02:43:38,540 --> 02:43:41,580
I was pleasantly surprised by Joel McHale hosting it.

3519
02:43:42,780 --> 02:43:43,020
Yeah.

3520
02:43:43,020 --> 02:43:46,620
Sometimes he can be really annoying, but when he's not like, he's really funny.

3521
02:43:47,420 --> 02:43:47,660
Yeah.

3522
02:43:48,220 --> 02:43:50,780
That was two episodes built into an hour.

3523
02:43:50,780 --> 02:43:52,780
Like they did with Celebrity Family Feud.

3524
02:43:52,780 --> 02:43:57,660
They did change the rounds where they said it's like two rounds of five cards.

3525
02:43:57,660 --> 02:43:59,820
Each is one round of 10 cards.

3526
02:44:00,940 --> 02:44:01,260
Okay.

3527
02:44:01,820 --> 02:44:03,980
Well, that's, that's what they should do with Press Your Luck then.

3528
02:44:03,980 --> 02:44:07,420
They shouldn't feel the need to make it an hour and they just make it two half hour episodes

3529
02:44:07,420 --> 02:44:08,380
back to back or something.

3530
02:44:08,380 --> 02:44:11,420
That's, uh, yeah.

3531
02:44:11,420 --> 02:44:12,300
Now here's, okay.

3532
02:44:12,300 --> 02:44:17,100
So since it is a video game podcast, you know, a lot of early video games and certainly things

3533
02:44:17,100 --> 02:44:20,620
that I remember playing a lot of like good old Commodore 64 and stuff that I remember

3534
02:44:20,620 --> 02:44:23,740
playing was conversions of game shows.

3535
02:44:23,740 --> 02:44:28,220
So do you think that whole game show Renaissance we're seeing, especially on ABC is like their

3536
02:44:28,220 --> 02:44:32,780
summer programming because God, what you have Press Your Luck, you have Card Sharks, you

3537
02:44:32,780 --> 02:44:35,100
have the a hundred thousand dollar pyramid is still a thing, right?

3538
02:44:35,100 --> 02:44:36,940
Or whatever they call it now, pyramid, whatever it is.

3539
02:44:37,020 --> 02:44:37,980
That's still a thing, right?

3540
02:44:37,980 --> 02:44:39,260
Match game is still a thing.

3541
02:44:39,260 --> 02:44:40,940
Family Feud is still a thing.

3542
02:44:40,940 --> 02:44:45,500
Yet, I don't think we have a video game conversion for any of these, not a modern one.

3543
02:44:45,500 --> 02:44:48,140
Granted, you know, a lot, those games that have been around forever.

3544
02:44:48,140 --> 02:44:49,340
Well, are they on mobile though?

3545
02:44:49,980 --> 02:44:50,860
Oh God.

3546
02:44:50,860 --> 02:44:52,380
Why did you have to go there?

3547
02:44:52,380 --> 02:44:57,660
They are mobile, but I think there, I think it might've been Ubisoft or another company

3548
02:44:57,660 --> 02:45:02,620
going back to me about five, six, seven years, they did have like those games.

3549
02:45:02,620 --> 02:45:07,660
Like there was a Price is Right game.

3550
02:45:07,660 --> 02:45:11,740
I've seen that like as a pack-in game on various laptops and desktops back in the day.

3551
02:45:12,860 --> 02:45:13,580
Yeah, true.

3552
02:45:13,580 --> 02:45:17,100
And some folks in chat are naming, there's other game shows still around as well.

3553
02:45:17,100 --> 02:45:19,980
Of course, you know, your old standards, Wheel of Fortune and Jeopardy, those have been on

3554
02:45:19,980 --> 02:45:20,700
forever.

3555
02:45:20,700 --> 02:45:26,140
And I guess Alex Trebek is doing better, which is fantastic to hear.

3556
02:45:26,140 --> 02:45:30,140
Jeopardy's kind of having a Renaissance right now when you got that guy that was so close

3557
02:45:30,140 --> 02:45:33,340
to breaking the record and then just had a bad day or something.

3558
02:45:33,340 --> 02:45:34,700
Didn't, didn't make it at the end there.

3559
02:45:35,340 --> 02:45:38,620
But you know, Jeopardy's kind of having a Renaissance right now between all those things.

3560
02:45:38,620 --> 02:45:40,540
And I feel like that game's going to be around forever.

3561
02:45:40,540 --> 02:45:43,580
And you know, those make for some good game show conversions as well.

3562
02:45:44,860 --> 02:45:46,300
Let's see, what else are they saying here?

3563
02:45:46,940 --> 02:45:47,820
Oh yeah.

3564
02:45:47,820 --> 02:45:51,020
The Are You Smarter Than a Fifth Grader just got rebooted as well.

3565
02:45:51,020 --> 02:45:54,460
My kids totally want to see it now because they're huge fans of John Cena.

3566
02:45:54,460 --> 02:45:57,580
We saw the trailer before they had like the previews before the

3567
02:45:58,460 --> 02:45:59,660
Secret Life of Pets 2.

3568
02:45:59,660 --> 02:46:02,860
So they're like, Oh my God, we've got to watch this show because John Cena is in it.

3569
02:46:02,860 --> 02:46:04,700
So he's fun.

3570
02:46:04,700 --> 02:46:06,700
Make sure you show your kids Double Dare as well.

3571
02:46:07,900 --> 02:46:10,300
Oh yeah, the Double Dare reboot's apparently really good too.

3572
02:46:10,300 --> 02:46:10,700
Yeah.

3573
02:46:10,700 --> 02:46:11,420
It's so good.

3574
02:46:12,460 --> 02:46:13,980
So yeah, game shows are-

3575
02:46:13,980 --> 02:46:17,820
I just got to figure out which streaming service that's on because I don't have technically

3576
02:46:17,820 --> 02:46:21,180
cable, but I have like Hulu and Amazon and Netflix.

3577
02:46:22,060 --> 02:46:24,620
I just don't think any of those have those.

3578
02:46:24,620 --> 02:46:26,860
It's like probably its own standalone Nickelodeon.

3579
02:46:27,340 --> 02:46:30,140
Kaijuto in chat says game shows never went away.

3580
02:46:30,140 --> 02:46:33,900
They just bring back old classics, but we've had primetime game shows for decades that

3581
02:46:33,900 --> 02:46:34,700
hasn't changed.

3582
02:46:34,700 --> 02:46:35,740
That's true.

3583
02:46:35,740 --> 02:46:37,820
I mean, you know, game shows have kind of always been a thing.

3584
02:46:37,820 --> 02:46:43,020
Well, especially in daytime, like The Price is Right hasn't stopped since the sixties

3585
02:46:43,020 --> 02:46:44,780
when that's, I mean, that show has been on forever.

3586
02:46:44,780 --> 02:46:47,500
Wheel of Fortune and Jeopardy, they've been on nonstop since the eighties.

3587
02:46:48,220 --> 02:46:51,180
And Let's Make a Deal is on CBS.

3588
02:46:51,180 --> 02:46:52,060
Oh yeah, that's back.

3589
02:46:52,060 --> 02:46:55,100
Let's Make a Deal has been on for quite some time for sure.

3590
02:46:55,500 --> 02:46:59,180
And then, you know, there's always Games for Network and also game shows kind of took a

3591
02:46:59,180 --> 02:47:03,740
little turn and not everybody's going to be a fan of this, but in some ways, things like

3592
02:47:03,740 --> 02:47:06,540
Survivor are a game show, right?

3593
02:47:06,540 --> 02:47:08,780
Yeah, you do win a million dollars, right?

3594
02:47:08,780 --> 02:47:10,460
And it is a game that they're playing.

3595
02:47:10,460 --> 02:47:12,620
It's just a very different, very psychological game.

3596
02:47:12,620 --> 02:47:15,980
That's not always glamorous, but Survivor in many ways is a game show.

3597
02:47:15,980 --> 02:47:20,460
It's just a very different type that then kind of started its own genre where you still

3598
02:47:20,460 --> 02:47:21,900
have Amazing Race on there.

3599
02:47:21,900 --> 02:47:23,340
Amazing Race is still going.

3600
02:47:24,140 --> 02:47:25,420
Don't get out of the kitchen.

3601
02:47:25,420 --> 02:47:26,220
I mean, come on.

3602
02:47:26,220 --> 02:47:31,900
It's Amazing Race is meta at this point because Amazing Race this current season is all, it's

3603
02:47:31,900 --> 02:47:37,020
either people that prior played the Amazing Race versus Survivor contestants as teams

3604
02:47:37,020 --> 02:47:39,500
versus Big Brother contestants as teams.

3605
02:47:39,500 --> 02:47:40,700
So that's all getting meta.

3606
02:47:40,700 --> 02:47:42,140
And Big Brother is another type.

3607
02:47:42,140 --> 02:47:44,780
Then Big Brother is kind of like the Jerry Springer of game shows.

3608
02:47:46,380 --> 02:47:49,100
But I live for it.

3609
02:47:49,100 --> 02:47:50,380
I'll watch it for sure.

3610
02:47:50,380 --> 02:47:55,660
So, yeah, Bobby Black Wolf in chat says the mole with Anderson Cooper is still the best.

3611
02:47:55,660 --> 02:47:56,860
Co-signed.

3612
02:47:56,860 --> 02:48:00,940
Man, I wish they'd bring back the mole, which I realized they've already done twice, but

3613
02:48:00,940 --> 02:48:02,700
they haven't done it as good as the first time.

3614
02:48:02,700 --> 02:48:05,420
They need to find a host as good as Anderson Cooper.

3615
02:48:05,420 --> 02:48:06,060
I know.

3616
02:48:06,620 --> 02:48:09,660
I mean, you might say nobody is going to be as good as Anderson Cooper and that may or

3617
02:48:09,660 --> 02:48:09,900
may not.

3618
02:48:09,900 --> 02:48:11,420
No, I would be as good as Anderson Cooper.

3619
02:48:11,420 --> 02:48:12,860
I will host the fucking mole reboot.

3620
02:48:13,580 --> 02:48:16,460
Somebody, but obviously they're not going to give me a call.

3621
02:48:17,260 --> 02:48:19,020
Obviously they're not going to give me a call.

3622
02:48:19,020 --> 02:48:21,820
Somebody out there has got to have that tongue in cheek.

3623
02:48:22,460 --> 02:48:27,100
Who could, who would be a good person that's like kind of serious when they need to be,

3624
02:48:27,100 --> 02:48:30,060
but very tongue in cheek when the time is appropriate.

3625
02:48:30,060 --> 02:48:32,300
I think kind of Jeff Probst is very good at this too.

3626
02:48:32,300 --> 02:48:37,100
Although I think Jeff Probst was, is kind of a better host than he is a producer.

3627
02:48:37,100 --> 02:48:37,900
I'm not sure.

3628
02:48:37,900 --> 02:48:40,780
Like this last season of Survivor was not good.

3629
02:48:40,780 --> 02:48:44,860
And this new season of Survivor is looking a little, but

3630
02:48:45,020 --> 02:48:47,660
as far as Survivor goes, there's an all winners edition.

3631
02:48:47,660 --> 02:48:49,180
That's like the next one.

3632
02:48:49,660 --> 02:48:52,940
And everybody, like everybody's hyped about that.

3633
02:48:52,940 --> 02:48:57,020
Like, because it's going to be, because you believe it or not guys, Survivor is coming

3634
02:48:57,020 --> 02:48:59,340
up on its 40th season.

3635
02:48:59,340 --> 02:49:04,620
So this next one's 39 in the fall, 40 is going to be, so for their 40th edition, they found

3636
02:49:04,620 --> 02:49:09,820
16 prior winners to make up the cast because they have so many people to choose from.

3637
02:49:09,820 --> 02:49:11,660
So now the winners are going to do battle.

3638
02:49:11,660 --> 02:49:13,340
So that's, that's pretty cool though.

3639
02:49:13,580 --> 02:49:17,820
So somebody is going to go from winning the game to getting voted out first, but that

3640
02:49:17,820 --> 02:49:19,180
already happened actually.

3641
02:49:19,180 --> 02:49:23,820
Survivor geek, for back in the day, I don't watch the new ones as much, but the old ones

3642
02:49:23,820 --> 02:49:27,340
that happened to Tina, she won Survivor, the Australian Outback, and then Survivor All-Stars,

3643
02:49:27,340 --> 02:49:30,780
she got voted out first because she was a prior winner.

3644
02:49:30,780 --> 02:49:32,220
So, whoops.

3645
02:49:32,220 --> 02:49:34,540
Anyway, yes.

3646
02:49:34,540 --> 02:49:39,820
Going to chat over at Twitch, Act F says one versus 100 in video game form again.

3647
02:49:39,820 --> 02:49:40,620
That'd be great.

3648
02:49:40,620 --> 02:49:42,940
DJ Rama S says Millionaire was canceled.

3649
02:49:42,940 --> 02:49:46,700
Yeah, Millionaire was going for a long time and it went through many hosts.

3650
02:49:46,700 --> 02:49:50,060
Like it had, obviously the Regis Philbin won in prime time, but the Meredith Vieira one

3651
02:49:50,060 --> 02:49:51,500
went for a long time.

3652
02:49:51,500 --> 02:49:53,180
And then who hosted after her?

3653
02:49:53,180 --> 02:49:56,060
Cedric the Entertainer, I think, for a minute.

3654
02:49:56,060 --> 02:50:03,020
And then they had one of the guys from Dancing with the Stars did it, and then now it's done.

3655
02:50:03,020 --> 02:50:04,140
I don't think it's on anymore.

3656
02:50:04,140 --> 02:50:08,380
So, oh, Shane says it's not 16 winners.

3657
02:50:08,620 --> 02:50:10,540
Oh, Shane says it's not 16 winners.

3658
02:50:10,540 --> 02:50:11,420
It's 20.

3659
02:50:11,420 --> 02:50:12,140
Holy crap.

3660
02:50:12,780 --> 02:50:16,140
And no, apparently Richard Hatch is not in it for whatever reason.

3661
02:50:17,100 --> 02:50:22,140
People are speculating it could be because of the jail time that he served from not paying

3662
02:50:22,140 --> 02:50:28,700
his taxes the first time, or the fact that there was something that really, really hasn't

3663
02:50:28,700 --> 02:50:29,260
aged well.

3664
02:50:29,260 --> 02:50:32,300
Well, it wasn't good when it happened, but in the original All-Stars...

3665
02:50:32,300 --> 02:50:33,580
Didn't I just talk about this on OR?

3666
02:50:33,580 --> 02:50:35,020
Yes, like last week.

3667
02:50:35,020 --> 02:50:37,100
Go back to OR like three weeks ago, I talked about this earlier.

3668
02:50:37,100 --> 02:50:39,420
It was a sexual harassment thing that happened, and it wasn't good.

3669
02:50:39,420 --> 02:50:44,700
So anyway, okay, enough about the old game shows.

3670
02:50:45,660 --> 02:50:49,740
What game show would you want to see them make a new video game out of most of all?

3671
02:50:50,780 --> 02:50:51,740
Oh, man.

3672
02:50:54,140 --> 02:50:59,420
I mean, with interactivity and so forth, I would have to say it would have to be a toss-up

3673
02:50:59,420 --> 02:51:04,220
between Double Dare or Funhaus, because I love to live in daylight to hope those game shows.

3674
02:51:05,020 --> 02:51:08,300
It'll be hard to translate those to video games, though, but they are fun shows.

3675
02:51:08,300 --> 02:51:11,180
But it's just not the same if you don't have actual gak to go through.

3676
02:51:11,180 --> 02:51:11,980
I got a good one.

3677
02:51:11,980 --> 02:51:12,220
Okay.

3678
02:51:12,860 --> 02:51:15,420
So I want to see a VR version of Nick Arcade.

3679
02:51:16,620 --> 02:51:20,220
So like, you're actually standing up, you know, hitting the buzzer and everything like

3680
02:51:20,220 --> 02:51:23,580
that, and we have to go into the actual arcade, like, arcade game.

3681
02:51:23,580 --> 02:51:24,860
It'd be VR, and you can just...

3682
02:51:25,820 --> 02:51:26,700
Okay, all right.

3683
02:51:27,340 --> 02:51:28,380
Um, my answer...

3684
02:51:28,380 --> 02:51:30,300
I just wanted to bring back 1 vs 100.

3685
02:51:30,300 --> 02:51:32,940
I think that was a great concept that was ahead of its time.

3686
02:51:32,940 --> 02:51:33,980
Or VR Guts.

3687
02:51:33,980 --> 02:51:37,100
Let's just do VR, all of the Nick, all the Nick stuff.

3688
02:51:37,100 --> 02:51:37,740
Yeah.

3689
02:51:37,740 --> 02:51:38,240
All right.

3690
02:51:38,700 --> 02:51:40,460
Rama, I'm going to let you go so we can wrap up the show.

3691
02:51:40,460 --> 02:51:41,260
But thanks for the call.

3692
02:51:41,260 --> 02:51:42,940
You know, I'll always talk about old game shows.

3693
02:51:43,900 --> 02:51:46,380
Let me just say 1 vs 100 before I get out of here.

3694
02:51:46,380 --> 02:51:46,700
Yeah.

3695
02:51:46,700 --> 02:51:49,740
One night, a special all-anime edition.

3696
02:51:49,740 --> 02:51:55,500
So all of my squad were on Xbox Live, trash-talking each other, going through the questions.

3697
02:51:56,380 --> 02:52:01,420
At the end of the round, at the end of the game, I was up there at the number two slot.

3698
02:52:01,420 --> 02:52:03,260
And I wish I still had a screenshot of that.

3699
02:52:04,620 --> 02:52:05,900
Nice, nice.

3700
02:52:05,900 --> 02:52:06,780
That's great.

3701
02:52:06,780 --> 02:52:08,060
I wish I was around the night.

3702
02:52:08,060 --> 02:52:10,940
They did like a video game trivia night, but I couldn't make it.

3703
02:52:10,940 --> 02:52:12,380
But I know I would have kicked butt at it.

3704
02:52:12,380 --> 02:52:18,620
But I need to get motivated and really assert myself to do more game show hosting panels at cons.

3705
02:52:18,620 --> 02:52:21,020
I really should have bid to try to do one at Dragon Comet.

3706
02:52:21,020 --> 02:52:23,100
It's one of those things I just didn't think of until after the fact.

3707
02:52:23,100 --> 02:52:27,580
But I would love to host more game shows at conventions because I think it's a lot of fun.

3708
02:52:27,580 --> 02:52:31,180
And some of the ones that I've been to needed some help.

3709
02:52:31,180 --> 02:52:33,420
So that's my goal.

3710
02:52:33,420 --> 02:52:35,020
I think I'm gonna make that a goal in the next year.

3711
02:52:35,020 --> 02:52:38,060
I will host a game show at a convention and it will be awesome.

3712
02:52:38,780 --> 02:52:42,460
Rob, you need to get connected to some various people because that's the big thing,

3713
02:52:42,460 --> 02:52:43,820
especially anime con.

3714
02:52:43,820 --> 02:52:50,060
There are game show departments and you got people who are writing horror point presentations

3715
02:52:50,060 --> 02:52:53,500
and flash games templates just to run these game shows.

3716
02:52:53,500 --> 02:52:59,180
And I'm actually trying to put something together like Family Feud set up for a con next year.

3717
02:53:01,020 --> 02:53:01,660
That'll be fun.

3718
02:53:02,620 --> 02:53:03,420
Yeah.

3719
02:53:03,420 --> 02:53:04,220
All right.

3720
02:53:04,220 --> 02:53:04,860
All right, my friend.

3721
02:53:04,860 --> 02:53:05,740
I'm gonna let you go.

3722
02:53:05,740 --> 02:53:06,380
So take care.

3723
02:53:07,180 --> 02:53:07,660
You too.

3724
02:53:07,660 --> 02:53:08,620
Stay fabulous, man.

3725
02:53:08,620 --> 02:53:09,340
I will.

3726
02:53:09,340 --> 02:53:09,740
Take care.

3727
02:53:09,740 --> 02:53:09,900
Bye.

3728
02:53:11,260 --> 02:53:11,820
All right.

3729
02:53:11,820 --> 02:53:13,580
Always good to hear from Rama.

3730
02:53:13,580 --> 02:53:14,460
But that is gonna do it.

3731
02:53:14,460 --> 02:53:15,740
Nobody else is waiting on Discord.

3732
02:53:15,740 --> 02:53:19,420
So we'll go ahead and close down Discord because I think it's about time we wrap up the show

3733
02:53:20,460 --> 02:53:22,220
and get on out of here for the night.

3734
02:53:22,220 --> 02:53:24,700
So I want to thank you all for listening though tonight.

3735
02:53:24,700 --> 02:53:28,380
Whether you were watching along with us live on Twitch or you're listening to this on the podcast

3736
02:53:28,380 --> 02:53:32,700
feed where of course the show is still always available in places like iTunes, Google Play

3737
02:53:32,700 --> 02:53:33,500
Store and so on.

3738
02:53:33,500 --> 02:53:36,620
Yes, I know we need to get into more places and I'm going to be working on that in the

3739
02:53:36,620 --> 02:53:37,660
very new future.

3740
02:53:37,660 --> 02:53:43,900
I'm also, since next week is a birthday show of sorts, I am working on some things for

3741
02:53:43,900 --> 02:53:51,820
next week to try to, as has been said in one Food Network guy, kick it up a notch a little

3742
02:53:51,820 --> 02:53:52,060
bit.

3743
02:53:52,060 --> 02:53:56,540
So in other words, what he's trying to tell you is that he's going to be acquiring a buzzer.

3744
02:53:57,500 --> 02:53:58,540
That too.

3745
02:53:58,540 --> 02:53:59,660
I'll be working on that.

3746
02:53:59,660 --> 02:54:02,060
That wasn't on my list until tonight, but there it is.

3747
02:54:02,060 --> 02:54:06,940
Anyway, so if you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Laundry tonight, tell a friend or

3748
02:54:06,940 --> 02:54:07,580
two about the show.

3749
02:54:07,580 --> 02:54:10,380
Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice.

3750
02:54:10,380 --> 02:54:15,020
But if the voices aren't here to put out on the air, then how can we possibly air them?

3751
02:54:15,020 --> 02:54:19,580
So with that, Loki, thank you, of course, for being here as you always are.

3752
02:54:19,580 --> 02:54:21,660
Do you have any last thoughts for listeners tonight?

3753
02:54:22,300 --> 02:54:23,420
I may stream this week.

3754
02:54:23,420 --> 02:54:23,820
I don't know.

3755
02:54:23,820 --> 02:54:30,460
Depends whether I decide to do some streaming or be ridiculous and work extra long hours

3756
02:54:30,460 --> 02:54:31,340
on work stuff.

3757
02:54:32,460 --> 02:54:33,580
So, you know, I don't know.

3758
02:54:33,580 --> 02:54:37,020
We'll see how it goes, but I've got several nights I can do it, so.

3759
02:54:39,740 --> 02:54:40,300
We'll see.

3760
02:54:40,300 --> 02:54:41,500
Or I could clean the house.

3761
02:54:42,540 --> 02:54:44,940
None of those sound like fun ideas, except for streaming.

3762
02:54:44,940 --> 02:54:45,820
That's why you have kids.

3763
02:54:45,820 --> 02:54:46,860
Make them clean.

3764
02:54:46,860 --> 02:54:49,260
Or they don't eat dinner.

3765
02:54:49,260 --> 02:54:49,740
Or they don't.

3766
02:54:49,740 --> 02:54:50,380
Yeah, right.

3767
02:54:51,340 --> 02:54:58,300
Anyway, my final thought for the night is, hey, if you if you can get your butt to Dragon

3768
02:54:58,300 --> 02:55:03,180
Con over Labor Day weekend in Atlanta, I can't say too much, but some of the early stuff

3769
02:55:03,180 --> 02:55:06,620
is starting to take shape and it's going to it's going to be a heck of a year.

3770
02:55:06,620 --> 02:55:08,220
It's going to be a really fun year.

3771
02:55:08,220 --> 02:55:10,300
I'm finally getting extra for to go this year.

3772
02:55:10,300 --> 02:55:11,900
Need I say more that alone?

3773
02:55:11,900 --> 02:55:15,820
I really want to before there's any talk about any panels or any of that stuff.

3774
02:55:15,820 --> 02:55:17,900
That alone should be the reason to go to Dragon Con.

3775
02:55:17,900 --> 02:55:18,620
It's gonna be fun.

3776
02:55:18,620 --> 02:55:19,740
How many days is Dragon Con?

3777
02:55:20,780 --> 02:55:21,500
It runs.

3778
02:55:21,500 --> 02:55:22,700
It's technically now.

3779
02:55:22,700 --> 02:55:24,300
Thursday is technically a day now.

3780
02:55:24,300 --> 02:55:28,460
It was Thursday through Sunday, Thursday through Monday, Monday weekend, Thursday,

3781
02:55:28,460 --> 02:55:29,740
you don't have to go every day.

3782
02:55:29,740 --> 02:55:30,780
A lot of locals don't.

3783
02:55:30,780 --> 02:55:33,180
They just go to the parade and maybe go to a day on Saturday.

3784
02:55:33,180 --> 02:55:38,780
But no, this year I'm going to be gone this year for nine days.

3785
02:55:38,780 --> 02:55:41,900
I think it is because I'm going to visit extra for North Carolina.

3786
02:55:41,900 --> 02:55:42,700
I'm actually going to miss.

3787
02:55:42,700 --> 02:55:46,860
So at the end of August, just to warn you guys, we're going to miss two weeks of our.

3788
02:55:46,860 --> 02:55:51,020
I'm really sorry, but hey, Dragon Con is just that big a deal this year

3789
02:55:51,740 --> 02:55:53,340
where we're going to miss one week because Dragon Con,

3790
02:55:53,340 --> 02:55:56,460
I'm actually flying out the Saturday before, so I'll miss that Sunday.

3791
02:55:56,460 --> 02:56:00,300
So my hope is we can actually prior record so that we don't miss a time,

3792
02:56:00,300 --> 02:56:02,140
but we'll have a prior recorded show the week before.

3793
02:56:02,140 --> 02:56:07,660
Or we'll just do the Orange Lounge Pirate Radio Show where I will host in my dirty ass garage.

3794
02:56:07,660 --> 02:56:09,740
You and Jamie have every right to take over for a night.

3795
02:56:09,740 --> 02:56:12,220
It's just, you know, you got to get me the MP3 so we can get it posted.

3796
02:56:12,220 --> 02:56:15,020
But yeah, the Pirate Radio version, that'd be a lot of fun.

3797
02:56:15,020 --> 02:56:16,060
So, all right.

3798
02:56:17,500 --> 02:56:19,500
Anyway, yeah.

3799
02:56:19,500 --> 02:56:21,660
Bobby Blackwell says our Dragon Con starts Wednesday.

3800
02:56:21,660 --> 02:56:25,660
We'll try to film something at Dragon Con and premiere it on our usual slot.

3801
02:56:25,660 --> 02:56:30,620
That's also a good call is that we will probably film something.

3802
02:56:30,620 --> 02:56:33,340
And because Twitch does let us do video on demand,

3803
02:56:33,340 --> 02:56:36,460
we can probably actually film, edit and have it up

3804
02:56:37,020 --> 02:56:41,660
on the Twitch TV for Sunday night at 8 Eastern, 5 Pacific.

3805
02:56:41,660 --> 02:56:42,780
So that's very likely.

3806
02:56:42,780 --> 02:56:45,420
It won't be like OLR and it won't be Bobby Blackwell,

3807
02:56:45,420 --> 02:56:49,340
but it'll be some of the faces having fun at Dragon Con.

3808
02:56:49,340 --> 02:56:50,380
I think it'll be a good time.

3809
02:56:50,380 --> 02:56:51,820
So anyway, but stay tuned for that.

3810
02:56:51,820 --> 02:56:53,020
That's still a few months away.

3811
02:56:53,020 --> 02:56:56,300
I would just encourage you to be there in person in Atlanta if you can.

3812
02:56:56,300 --> 02:56:57,580
But we're going to wrap up this week's show.

3813
02:56:57,580 --> 02:57:02,540
We'll be back in seven days to celebrate 17 years of Orange Lounge Radio.

3814
02:57:03,340 --> 02:57:04,540
17 years.

3815
02:57:04,540 --> 02:57:06,780
Old enough, just about old enough to vote.

3816
02:57:06,780 --> 02:57:08,140
Old enough to have a job.

3817
02:57:08,140 --> 02:57:09,820
Old enough to be a senior in high school.

3818
02:57:09,820 --> 02:57:14,860
We'll be back here to celebrate that next week with you all.

3819
02:57:15,500 --> 02:57:17,420
Many opportunities to call in next week

3820
02:57:17,420 --> 02:57:18,940
and hopefully some other special treats as well.

3821
02:57:18,940 --> 02:57:22,220
So we really hope you'll join us here for our 17th birthday next week.

3822
02:57:22,220 --> 02:57:24,140
In the meantime, happy gaming.

3823
02:57:24,140 --> 02:57:25,340
Lots of games to play.

3824
02:57:25,340 --> 02:57:27,020
Go play them and be nice.

3825
02:57:27,020 --> 02:57:27,260
Bye.

3826
02:57:28,220 --> 02:57:30,860
