00:00.000 --> 00:17.680
This week another E3 is in the books and the other expected E3 reference in the intro

00:17.680 --> 00:18.680
as well.

00:18.680 --> 00:21.680
We're recapping our favorite pieces of news from the keynotes, show floor, nearby vicinity

00:21.680 --> 00:22.680
and the week in general.

00:22.680 --> 00:26.380
Join us and enjoy the hopeful excitement starting right now on the show where every gamer has

00:26.380 --> 00:27.380
a voice.

00:27.380 --> 00:32.780
Orange Lounge Radio

00:32.780 --> 00:36.100
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show

00:36.100 --> 00:37.980
where every gamer has a voice.

00:37.980 --> 00:42.620
It is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight with episode number 780.

00:42.620 --> 00:44.620
Uh oh, I got a problem in the title.

00:44.620 --> 00:48.900
For this June the 16th of 2019.

00:48.900 --> 00:54.620
My name is Rob Roberts and joining me, welcome back tonight, DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

00:54.620 --> 00:55.620
Oh hi.

00:55.620 --> 00:56.620
Hi, how are you?

00:56.620 --> 00:57.620
Okay.

00:57.620 --> 00:58.620
Yeah, well we missed you last week.

00:58.620 --> 01:00.780
What did you throw?

01:00.780 --> 01:04.980
Our aim is always going to be improving though, but I hope you had a good weekend.

01:04.980 --> 01:05.980
I know you had a very busy weekend.

01:05.980 --> 01:07.620
No, last week was a clusterfuck.

01:07.620 --> 01:08.620
Last weekend was a clusterfuck.

01:08.620 --> 01:10.380
Sorry to hear it.

01:10.380 --> 01:12.700
But hey, I lived.

01:12.700 --> 01:13.700
That's right.

01:13.700 --> 01:14.700
You lived to tell the tale.

01:14.700 --> 01:16.300
I'll just put it this way.

01:16.300 --> 01:17.300
Sack pride was drama.

01:17.300 --> 01:19.980
Yeah, it was a lot of drama.

01:19.980 --> 01:24.820
All right, anyway, Drama Free joining me to my right, your guys' left on TV.

01:24.820 --> 01:26.180
Say hello to Techmaster Loki.

01:26.180 --> 01:27.900
I wish I was drama free.

01:27.900 --> 01:32.300
But you don't have a lot of drama to bring, well not that Jamie brings drama to the show,

01:32.300 --> 01:33.300
but it is.

01:33.300 --> 01:34.820
No, I didn't bring any of it to the show.

01:34.820 --> 01:37.780
But what you did bring, and I'm so excited about this y'all, I'm so excited to show this

01:37.780 --> 01:42.460
and I'll talk about this with our podcast listeners, but you actually picked me up an

01:42.460 --> 01:44.780
early birthday gift and I'm so excited about it.

01:44.780 --> 01:46.180
It's a mini Commodore 64.

01:46.180 --> 01:47.180
Yes.

01:47.180 --> 01:48.900
Look Bobby, finally got one of these.

01:48.900 --> 01:51.340
Tell me a little bit about what made you decide to pick one of these up.

01:51.340 --> 01:54.020
The Evil G has it $50 off retail.

01:54.020 --> 01:55.020
Yeah.

01:55.540 --> 01:56.780
So that's why.

01:56.780 --> 02:01.340
And I think it's because they're clearing the shelves for the new one that will probably

02:01.340 --> 02:02.340
come out this year.

02:02.340 --> 02:06.180
Because I heard there's supposed to be like a C64 fat this year, full size.

02:06.180 --> 02:07.180
I don't know, maybe.

02:07.180 --> 02:08.180
Oh yeah, I already got you your present.

02:08.180 --> 02:10.580
Oh, well y'all don't have to give me presents.

02:10.580 --> 02:14.340
Well no, the pre-order thing.

02:14.340 --> 02:15.740
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:15.740 --> 02:16.780
So here's the thing.

02:16.780 --> 02:22.100
So Orange House Radio actually next week is going to be, I almost said 23 years old, but

02:22.500 --> 02:24.940
on the 23rd will be 17 years old.

02:24.940 --> 02:29.220
Our first broadcast was actually, and it's the right date too, our first broadcast was

02:29.220 --> 02:31.620
June 23rd, 2002.

02:31.620 --> 02:35.380
So next week is going to mark our 17th birthday, but the just kind of ironic thing is that

02:35.380 --> 02:38.740
my personal birthday is three days after that, June 26th.

02:38.740 --> 02:41.180
So it just kind of, it kind of works out well.

02:41.180 --> 02:43.380
And I mean it, I don't really need presents.

02:43.380 --> 02:48.380
I appreciate them, but having you guys here every week to do this show with is a present

02:48.380 --> 02:49.380
in and of itself.

02:49.380 --> 02:50.380
I just couldn't pass it up.

02:50.380 --> 02:55.500
It was like either a PlayStation classic mini or that I was like, well, I'm not buying that.

02:55.500 --> 02:57.300
So I think you made the right decision.

02:57.300 --> 02:59.300
I did make the right decision.

02:59.300 --> 03:00.300
All right.

03:00.300 --> 03:06.620
Uh, so Hey, we've got a lot of gaming news to get into because this week is E3 part two

03:06.620 --> 03:09.780
and there's just a lot going on in the gaming world.

03:09.780 --> 03:13.500
Last week when we were doing our show, we were right in the midst of everything, you

03:13.500 --> 03:16.580
know, with the Microsoft event having gone earlier that day.

03:16.580 --> 03:19.980
This time, you know, it's, it's been done for a couple of days now.

03:19.980 --> 03:22.580
It's interesting because E3, actually, even though it's like a three day show, it feels

03:22.580 --> 03:26.900
like it's a week because you have like your three days of press conferences and then that

03:26.900 --> 03:29.940
overlaps a little bit with three days of show.

03:29.940 --> 03:31.180
So it's kind of like a full week.

03:31.180 --> 03:32.700
It's kind of interesting how all that works.

03:32.700 --> 03:36.340
But uh, in this week we had some more press conferences.

03:36.340 --> 03:39.860
So let's start off with what I kind of think is the big one for a lot of people.

03:39.860 --> 03:42.640
Let's start off with Nintendo.

03:42.640 --> 03:46.140
Now Dark Sakura, you're back after being gone for a week.

03:46.140 --> 03:49.740
So I want to let you start with it because I know there's at least one thing that got

03:49.740 --> 03:50.740
your attention.

03:50.740 --> 03:51.740
There are two things that got my attention.

03:51.740 --> 03:52.740
Okay, go for it.

03:52.740 --> 03:58.140
So number one of course, Animal Crossing and I have sat and not only did I watch the trailer,

03:58.140 --> 04:03.100
but I watched the sponsored gameplay, you know, where they have the translators and

04:03.100 --> 04:04.780
everything and showing all the neat stuff.

04:04.780 --> 04:08.820
I've already decided that when the game comes out, I'm making a web comic out of it and

04:08.820 --> 04:12.780
it's going to be called Fuck You Nook.

04:12.780 --> 04:15.260
I might name it Worst Vacation Ever.

04:15.260 --> 04:18.020
I haven't decided, but I'm really excited about it.

04:18.060 --> 04:21.260
It looks like how I wanted it to, and it's got some neat stuff in there.

04:21.260 --> 04:25.140
I kind of dig the DIY stuff, so I'm really, really pleased.

04:25.140 --> 04:26.140
I'm looking forward to March.

04:26.140 --> 04:27.140
It'll be right before my birthday.

04:27.140 --> 04:30.160
It'll be a perfect present.

04:30.160 --> 04:33.260
What do you think about the whole setup where it's like, it's kind of funny the way it was

04:33.260 --> 04:36.540
set up because they're like, oh, we're going to kick you off on a desert island.

04:36.540 --> 04:39.400
You win a prize, all expenses paid.

04:39.400 --> 04:40.660
You're stuck with no shit.

04:40.660 --> 04:42.540
But people are moving there, right?

04:42.540 --> 04:43.880
So are they moving to your desert island?

04:43.880 --> 04:44.880
Is that the trick?

04:44.880 --> 04:45.880
I guess so.

04:45.920 --> 04:48.640
You could see very plainly in the gameplay that some of your favorites-

04:48.640 --> 04:49.640
There's Hammy.

04:49.640 --> 04:50.640
Yeah, are back.

04:50.640 --> 04:51.640
His name isn't Hammy.

04:51.640 --> 04:52.640
It's like Hamlet.

04:52.640 --> 04:53.640
Hamlet.

04:53.640 --> 04:54.640
Hamlet was in the playthrough.

04:54.640 --> 04:55.640
I'm like, oh.

04:55.640 --> 04:58.880
And I've got so many names now memorized because they're all in pocket camp.

04:58.880 --> 04:59.880
Mm-hmm.

04:59.880 --> 05:00.880
Sorry.

05:00.880 --> 05:03.880
I've been eating cinnamon rolls because I went to IKEA.

05:03.880 --> 05:04.880
That's fine.

05:04.880 --> 05:05.880
They're delicious too.

05:05.880 --> 05:06.880
Look at this.

05:06.880 --> 05:09.240
I'm trying very hard not to eat on stream.

05:09.240 --> 05:10.240
Cinnamon roll.

05:10.240 --> 05:11.240
Half eaten cinnamon roll.

05:11.240 --> 05:12.240
How appetizing.

05:12.240 --> 05:13.240
Because IKEA.

05:13.240 --> 05:14.240
So.

05:14.240 --> 05:15.240
Anyway.

05:15.600 --> 05:16.600
Animal Crossing.

05:16.600 --> 05:17.600
Animal Crossing.

05:17.600 --> 05:21.040
So but I'm really pleased with the updates to the graphical style because it really lends

05:21.040 --> 05:25.720
itself very well to the Switch's capabilities.

05:25.720 --> 05:30.280
I think the biggest thing that was in that trailer that really like sold me on this is

05:30.280 --> 05:31.280
like an upgrade.

05:31.280 --> 05:35.160
And you're all gonna laugh because it's not that big a deal, but I'm like, this changes

05:35.160 --> 05:36.160
everything.

05:36.160 --> 05:37.160
Multiply?

05:37.160 --> 05:40.560
The fact that you can decorate outside your house as well.

05:40.560 --> 05:41.560
Yes.

05:41.560 --> 05:42.560
That changes everything.

05:42.560 --> 05:44.160
I'm gonna make a trailer.

05:44.160 --> 05:46.400
Because now I'm like, oh, this game's got like a Stardew Valley.

05:46.400 --> 05:49.920
With a broken car and some tires.

05:49.920 --> 05:54.840
But there was definitely like, I don't know, I felt it like a Stardew Valley influence

05:54.840 --> 05:55.840
on that trailer.

05:55.840 --> 05:56.840
I might.

05:56.840 --> 05:57.840
Now we can really trap them in fences.

05:57.840 --> 06:03.000
It's a lot of the crafting and DIY-ness that people seem to really like a lot more lately.

06:03.000 --> 06:04.000
Yeah.

06:04.000 --> 06:06.300
So I think the fact that now you can decorate the outdoors and now you're gonna be able

06:06.300 --> 06:08.800
to really make that island your own.

06:08.800 --> 06:11.960
I think that's a game changer because, you know, in the earliest Animal Crossings, it

06:11.960 --> 06:18.600
was, was it put in a number between one and a thousand and it's a seed for a random map.

06:18.600 --> 06:22.600
But it's like, you know, you're so constrained and it's like you keep re-rolling until you

06:22.600 --> 06:23.600
get the one you want.

06:23.600 --> 06:26.780
But if you really, and maybe some of that will be true too, still with like where the

06:26.780 --> 06:27.920
animals move to.

06:27.920 --> 06:33.360
But if you really have the freedom to redecorate and like, you know, you can put like really

06:33.360 --> 06:36.400
hateful things in front of the animals' homes who you don't like.

06:36.400 --> 06:37.840
I can't wait to make signs.

06:37.840 --> 06:41.720
I just want Deanna to live in my village on my island.

06:41.720 --> 06:46.280
And I want, um, I want to kick Ed into orbit.

06:46.280 --> 06:51.800
By the way, I have a new, I have a character that I hadn't seen before named Julian who

06:51.800 --> 06:54.720
lives in Pocket Camp.

06:54.720 --> 07:00.240
And he's a unicorn that wears an outfit with, with stars and stuff on it.

07:00.240 --> 07:01.880
And that guy was in my town at one point.

07:01.880 --> 07:05.160
Well, you know, you know, in the game that you have to, you know, you can sometimes like

07:05.160 --> 07:08.060
help me pick out a present for this person.

07:08.060 --> 07:11.440
And I picked out a handbag for Julian and he's like, I love it.

07:11.440 --> 07:17.320
So Julian is now my, um, drag queen in my game.

07:17.320 --> 07:19.280
So animal crossing, you're very, very happy about that.

07:19.280 --> 07:20.280
Yeah.

07:20.280 --> 07:21.280
Very, very happy.

07:21.280 --> 07:22.680
How do you feel about the delay till March?

07:22.680 --> 07:23.680
I'm glad.

07:23.680 --> 07:24.680
Yeah.

07:24.680 --> 07:28.640
I'd rather it be complete than deal with, you know, Apache piece of shit.

07:28.640 --> 07:32.200
And did you hear that, um, they actually commented about the whole, like, cause Nintendo was

07:32.200 --> 07:36.120
asked about this crunch time thing in this industry and they actually said, you know,

07:36.120 --> 07:40.120
well, you know, they didn't kind of say like animal crossing was delayed due to that, but

07:40.120 --> 07:44.320
they did kind of come out and say, well, we're not afraid to do things that encourage

07:44.320 --> 07:45.320
a work life balance.

07:45.320 --> 07:49.240
In fact, you may have heard us say that we're delaying animal crossing.

07:49.240 --> 07:51.360
We're looking at you Sakurai.

07:51.360 --> 07:55.800
So they did, they bumped it back, assumably to avoid crunch time and all that stuff.

07:55.800 --> 07:58.020
So I I'm, I'm okay with it.

07:58.020 --> 07:59.740
We are looking at you Sakurai.

07:59.740 --> 08:02.280
We're not crunching on our net code at all.

08:02.280 --> 08:05.280
In fact, we're probably just not going to even put it in at all either.

08:05.280 --> 08:06.280
All right.

08:06.280 --> 08:09.320
And anyway, and the other thing I'm super happy about though, I'm sure a lot of us are

08:09.320 --> 08:14.300
as a sequel to breath of the wild and I've already got some theories about it, but the

08:14.300 --> 08:17.800
one of them actually has to do with Zelda's hair.

08:17.800 --> 08:18.800
Okay.

08:18.800 --> 08:20.280
Tell, tell us a little bit about this theory.

08:20.280 --> 08:21.280
Okay.

08:21.280 --> 08:25.040
So you noticed in the trailer that Zelda's hair is cut short.

08:25.040 --> 08:32.040
Usually it's easier to do a female character with short hair if they're going to be playable.

08:32.040 --> 08:36.840
So you think that Zelda is going to be a playable character or maybe chic type of thing.

08:36.840 --> 08:37.840
We'll see.

08:37.840 --> 08:42.180
But my other, my other thing too, is that the Ganon, the thing that they find under

08:42.180 --> 08:47.260
there is the original Ganon from Twilight princess because of where the hand was holding

08:47.260 --> 08:48.260
it down.

08:48.260 --> 08:53.300
I'm, I have a very firm feeling that breath of the wild is going to start bringing in

08:53.300 --> 08:56.320
that continuity that they've really been trying to bring back together.

08:56.320 --> 08:57.840
I do it like, don't get me wrong.

08:57.840 --> 09:01.760
I was, I was happy to hear them acknowledge breath of the wild too, but it's one of those

09:01.760 --> 09:04.020
things where I'm like, we've been new, like this game.

09:04.020 --> 09:06.000
Of course they're making another Zelda.

09:06.000 --> 09:10.920
Of course, after the rave reviews, breath of the wild guy and the, the 10 out of tens

09:10.920 --> 09:12.280
and the sales that that game had.

09:12.280 --> 09:17.000
And the fact that that game probably was a huge part of elevating the switch to the level

09:17.000 --> 09:18.000
it's at now.

09:18.000 --> 09:19.000
Duh.

09:19.000 --> 09:21.240
Of course you're going to make another game in its engine, but it's, it's still, I didn't

09:21.240 --> 09:23.760
think it was going to be a direct sequel though.

09:23.760 --> 09:24.760
That's that's fair.

09:24.760 --> 09:27.560
Like I was expecting it to go like a Majora's mass type of direction where it's like a new

09:27.560 --> 09:29.080
experience just in the same engine.

09:29.080 --> 09:31.840
So the fact, well, to be fair, we don't have a title.

09:31.840 --> 09:34.080
No, but it is a direct sequel.

09:34.080 --> 09:35.080
Okay.

09:35.160 --> 09:39.960
So in this case, number one, they said sequel number two outfits are the same.

09:39.960 --> 09:40.960
Yeah.

09:40.960 --> 09:44.840
Uh, from what I can tell voice acting is the same, even though we just heard gasps, the

09:44.840 --> 09:47.000
layout of the land was the same, the castle was the same.

09:47.000 --> 09:48.000
Okay.

09:48.000 --> 09:52.160
And yeah, we don't see that happen a lot where there's like a direct sequel like that.

09:52.160 --> 09:55.200
Like obviously all the Zelda games have played in the same universe, but you're right.

09:55.200 --> 10:00.320
That's kind of, and in breath of the wild, they said over and over that the evil came

10:00.320 --> 10:02.560
underneath Hyrule castle.

10:02.760 --> 10:06.320
When they did their discovery, it was clearly under Hyrule castle because you see the castle

10:06.320 --> 10:07.320
rise.

10:07.320 --> 10:08.320
Right.

10:08.320 --> 10:14.040
So, um, the other, you know, with the frame by frame analysis, I'd watched it a few times

10:14.040 --> 10:18.040
because I love breath of the wild and I love the lore that it set up a nifty eight Oh five

10:18.040 --> 10:19.040
in our chat room.

10:19.040 --> 10:22.720
We do have a live chat room because of course we do tape live every Sunday night at the

10:22.720 --> 10:26.140
voice of geeks network, twitch.tv slash vog network.

10:26.140 --> 10:28.600
That's V O G or voice of geeks network vog network.

10:28.600 --> 10:31.920
If you want to follow along and then you can get more information at vog network.com.

10:31.920 --> 10:35.440
Cause we have a lot of audio only shows that you should be checking out as well.

10:35.440 --> 10:39.120
Um, but uh, we do tape live and we have our chat room at twitch.tv slash vog network and

10:39.120 --> 10:41.920
nifty eight Oh five says dark Sakura with the receipts.

10:41.920 --> 10:42.920
Yes.

10:42.920 --> 10:43.920
The other thing too.

10:43.920 --> 10:46.640
Oh, she's got a CVS receipt.

10:46.640 --> 10:50.960
I got one question and she's got a receipt a mile long.

10:50.960 --> 10:53.280
Well just other, other things too that led into it.

10:53.280 --> 10:58.320
I had always wanted them to do, I was really wanting more DLC where it was Lincoln, Zelda

10:58.320 --> 11:00.120
going around fixing shit.

11:00.120 --> 11:05.440
Like I've had this whole thing in my head about her trying to, you know, that the treasury

11:05.440 --> 11:10.040
is intact and hiring people and rebuilding the castle town and Lon Lon ranch and all

11:10.040 --> 11:11.040
that crap.

11:11.040 --> 11:13.960
Cause you know, the ruins of Lon Lon ranch or what's supposed to be and the castle town

11:13.960 --> 11:14.960
are all there.

11:14.960 --> 11:15.960
You know?

11:15.960 --> 11:16.960
So I was looking at all of that.

11:16.960 --> 11:21.680
But the other thing that makes me think that this is the true Gannon that's under the castle

11:21.680 --> 11:25.620
is cause everything was something Gannon like a description.

11:25.620 --> 11:33.120
And I truly believe that all of those were a, uh, a projection of the original Gannon.

11:33.120 --> 11:35.000
And I like that theory.

11:35.000 --> 11:41.460
I really liked the idea of it, that there's just so much evil wrapped up in this creature

11:41.460 --> 11:45.620
that by them destroying all of the projections, cause they said that, you know, in the game

11:45.620 --> 11:48.100
it was said that this is the final form.

11:48.100 --> 11:51.660
It's ready to sacrifice itself fully for its mission.

11:51.660 --> 11:56.720
And then that's when the real Gannon wakes up because it has no other forms to project.

11:56.720 --> 12:00.400
So anyway, I've, I've got, I've got thoughts, thoughts.

12:00.400 --> 12:04.860
And from a non lore perspective, I'm dark to see from a, from how to build the game

12:04.860 --> 12:09.000
perspective says it would be easier to reuse a lot of the same code and engine instead

12:09.000 --> 12:10.740
of building a new game from the ground up.

12:10.740 --> 12:11.740
Oh, absolutely.

12:11.740 --> 12:13.540
I kind of always expected, but you're right.

12:13.540 --> 12:16.340
It's more like a direct sequel as opposed to it's a new Zelda story.

12:16.340 --> 12:17.340
It's just in the same engine.

12:17.340 --> 12:22.540
Well, and now the other thing, the other thing too is that, um, have you ever watched, there's,

12:22.540 --> 12:28.940
there's a YouTube channel I love called Boundary Break and, um, well, and I had already known

12:28.940 --> 12:32.700
some of this cause I like to see like, well, you know how I was in world of Warcraft when

12:32.700 --> 12:35.500
I got my demon Hunter.

12:35.500 --> 12:41.020
Like we all did like end of time and two hours later I'm like, I'm still an end of time outside

12:41.020 --> 12:42.120
the boundaries.

12:42.120 --> 12:46.860
You know, I'm in Dalaran now, an instance Dalaran, um, you know, I do stuff like that.

12:46.860 --> 12:50.620
So I love Boundary Break and you know, just looking into the complexity of how they built

12:50.620 --> 12:56.500
the game and that you've actually got rendered land outside of the borders.

12:56.500 --> 13:00.740
It makes me think they could do so much more with the engine that they probably had the

13:00.740 --> 13:04.160
capacity to and just did not.

13:04.160 --> 13:05.400
This is our developed area.

13:05.400 --> 13:07.660
The rest of it is no man's land.

13:07.660 --> 13:13.300
Mistake theory with a perspective in our chat saying, I love when Nintendo does direct sequels,

13:13.300 --> 13:14.500
silver and white too.

13:14.500 --> 13:18.420
I think you mean black and white too for Pokemon are probably my two favorite Pokemon games

13:18.420 --> 13:19.420
for that reason.

13:19.420 --> 13:20.420
Yeah.

13:20.420 --> 13:23.260
So, um, anything else on the Zelda sequel?

13:23.260 --> 13:24.260
Cause I want to talk.

13:24.260 --> 13:28.340
So, so dark Sakura's mentioned, those are the two things that got her going excited.

13:28.340 --> 13:30.500
And those, those, yeah.

13:30.500 --> 13:35.460
And nifty 805 says Lincoln, Zelda are the new sunny and share and Sia Tabiri says, so

13:35.460 --> 13:38.100
link should avoid skiing and Zelda is basically immortal.

13:38.100 --> 13:39.100
Oh geez.

13:39.100 --> 13:40.100
All right.

13:40.100 --> 13:41.100
And does she believe in life after love?

13:41.100 --> 13:42.100
All right.

13:42.100 --> 13:43.100
Anyway.

13:43.100 --> 13:44.940
So those are the two things that got you excited.

13:44.940 --> 13:45.940
Also shipping.

13:45.940 --> 13:49.700
I'm very excited about those games as well, but let me talk about the things that got

13:49.700 --> 13:53.940
me going like, okay, so here's the big thing.

13:53.940 --> 13:57.340
And Jamie, you have to appreciate this as well.

13:57.340 --> 14:04.180
Um, so we heard the rumors that the collection of mana was going to come out in the U S right.

14:04.180 --> 14:07.860
Although I full expected that they were going to do the lazy and they were just going to

14:07.860 --> 14:12.220
take final fantasy adventure, secret of mana, and they were either going to cut second and

14:12.260 --> 14:15.900
two, three, or they were going to give a secret of evermore instead, which I actually would

14:15.900 --> 14:16.900
have been okay with that.

14:16.900 --> 14:17.900
You know, I have that cartridge.

14:17.900 --> 14:18.900
Yeah, I do.

14:18.900 --> 14:19.900
I do too.

14:19.900 --> 14:20.900
Plot twist.

14:20.900 --> 14:22.500
Um, I don't have a lot of games, but that's one of them.

14:22.500 --> 14:25.260
And I always think that game got a lot more crap than it really deserved.

14:25.260 --> 14:26.260
I thought it was fine.

14:26.260 --> 14:31.860
Um, but then they came out and said, Oh yeah, the collection of mana is coming out.

14:31.860 --> 14:37.300
And by the way, second, it's at two, three is now trials of mana and it's out today.

14:37.300 --> 14:38.940
And I was like, bye.

14:38.940 --> 14:39.940
Yeah.

14:39.980 --> 14:43.300
Collection of mana is out on what girl I've played it on the switch.

14:43.300 --> 14:44.900
Holy crap.

14:44.900 --> 14:45.900
You didn't catch that.

14:45.900 --> 14:46.900
No.

14:46.900 --> 14:50.180
Cause I keep in mind, I've also been at work and had the drama.

14:50.180 --> 14:51.180
No, I got you.

14:51.180 --> 14:52.180
I got you.

14:52.180 --> 14:53.180
So I'm going to miss it.

14:53.180 --> 14:54.180
Yes, girl.

14:54.180 --> 14:55.180
You can play on the East door.

14:55.180 --> 14:56.180
Yeah.

14:56.180 --> 14:57.180
Okay.

14:57.180 --> 14:58.180
I'm going to go get my switch in the other room right now.

14:58.180 --> 14:59.180
I'm messaging Dan right now.

14:59.180 --> 15:00.180
You can play second.

15:00.180 --> 15:02.780
It's at two, three, the official English version right now.

15:02.780 --> 15:08.100
In fact, actually on my personal Twitch stream at Rob Roberts, cheap plug, uh, like on Wednesday

15:08.100 --> 15:09.100
and Friday this week.

15:09.260 --> 15:11.940
I've played through about two hours on stream, maybe a little longer, two and a half hours

15:11.940 --> 15:13.580
on stream and played some of the game.

15:13.580 --> 15:18.080
It's really like I did play the translated ROM a little bit, a long time ago, but I was

15:18.080 --> 15:19.080
kind of like lost.

15:19.080 --> 15:22.580
I didn't really know what I was doing and not to say that's necessarily changed, but

15:22.580 --> 15:27.020
I do feel like with the official English translation, I'm, I'm kind of like, I dunno, I'm a little

15:27.020 --> 15:30.420
bit like able to figure stuff out and go in the right directions.

15:30.420 --> 15:32.020
That's uh, that's really cool.

15:32.020 --> 15:33.560
Now here's the other thing.

15:33.560 --> 15:37.340
So not only did they announce that trials of mana or second, it says your three is out

15:37.340 --> 15:41.380
today in the English version of the collection of mana, but they announced we are working

15:41.380 --> 15:42.740
on a remake.

15:42.740 --> 15:48.300
So trials of mana is already being remade, just like they did secretive mana like earlier,

15:48.300 --> 15:50.780
like it was about last year, they did secretive mana.

15:50.780 --> 15:52.840
Now not everybody loved that remake.

15:52.840 --> 15:57.060
It had its issues, but Square Enix is saying, and they're talking about, we have learned

15:57.060 --> 16:00.620
from some of the issues of this and this is what we're going to do different with trials

16:00.620 --> 16:01.620
of mana.

16:01.620 --> 16:04.860
So it is nice to hear the company say we're doing some things differently.

16:04.880 --> 16:09.060
Um, so yeah, I'm like already excited for that remake as well.

16:09.060 --> 16:13.020
So, um, and you know what I've, I've been playing, it's, it's different.

16:13.020 --> 16:16.820
Trials of mana is different because like the beginning of the story is different depending

16:16.820 --> 16:18.780
on who you start with and how you build your party.

16:18.780 --> 16:19.780
Well, right.

16:19.780 --> 16:25.460
And because you, you're basically taking, uh, three different storylines out of seven

16:25.460 --> 16:29.820
players, six, six, and building it from there.

16:29.820 --> 16:30.820
Yeah.

16:30.820 --> 16:33.480
So, but yeah, anyway, so if you want to check out trials of mana, it's out now.

16:33.480 --> 16:36.440
So that was, that was definitely one of the big ones that got me going, what?

16:36.440 --> 16:41.200
Um, and then I would say as far as like games coming out today, uh, then they released that

16:41.200 --> 16:42.200
cadence of Hyrule.

16:42.200 --> 16:46.920
I mean, it wasn't today, but it was still like what by the end of E3 cadence of Hyrule

16:46.920 --> 16:51.120
came out, uh, which, you know, I haven't been able to play yet, sadly, because here's the

16:51.120 --> 16:52.120
thing.

16:52.120 --> 16:55.120
And y'all have even called me out on this on Twitch.

16:55.120 --> 16:58.000
If I buy cadence of Hyrule, what's going to happen?

16:58.000 --> 17:02.080
I will suddenly stop playing trials of mana and not get any further.

17:02.120 --> 17:03.120
So I have not bought.

17:03.120 --> 17:08.360
Well, then I will be playing through it because I don't really care about cadence of Hyrule.

17:08.360 --> 17:10.240
I didn't like Crypt of the Necrodancer.

17:10.240 --> 17:11.240
It just wasn't fun to me.

17:11.240 --> 17:12.240
Yeah.

17:12.240 --> 17:15.240
Well, you know, apparently they've made some changes to make it a little, I don't want

17:15.240 --> 17:19.960
to say to make it easier, but to make it feel a little less grindy, like, I guess you don't

17:19.960 --> 17:23.320
necessarily lose everything like you would in a lot of roguelikes.

17:23.320 --> 17:26.060
You don't necessarily lose everything when you die and go back to start.

17:26.060 --> 17:29.240
So they have tried to make some, I guess, quality of life improvements probably to appeal

17:29.240 --> 17:31.440
a little more to Zelda fans in that regard.

17:31.800 --> 17:35.320
If there was something else I was a little excited about was the Panzer Dragoon remake.

17:35.320 --> 17:36.320
Yes.

17:36.320 --> 17:37.320
How could I forget?

17:37.320 --> 17:38.320
Oh, my God.

17:38.320 --> 17:39.320
You know, what's funny?

17:39.320 --> 17:42.440
The news about the remake was already out there because I was like, I feel like did

17:42.440 --> 17:46.560
we and it what we did mention on a previous episode that but it was kind of like almost

17:46.560 --> 17:47.560
an aside.

17:47.560 --> 17:49.840
All it was was that we know these companies are working on it.

17:49.840 --> 17:54.240
We don't know where we don't know when we don't know how, but it turns out Nintendo,

17:54.240 --> 17:55.480
it's a switch game.

17:55.480 --> 18:00.040
So somebody brought up during Bobby's show, though, a Panzer Dragoon VR.

18:00.040 --> 18:04.200
I know you ain't all about VR, but I got to say, when I heard that was like, oh, things

18:04.200 --> 18:08.240
I didn't know I needed until you said it, there's a couple other things I was really

18:08.240 --> 18:09.240
excited about.

18:09.240 --> 18:10.240
Yeah, please.

18:10.240 --> 18:14.440
I mean, I'm actually disappointed about the Dark Crystal RPG.

18:14.440 --> 18:15.640
That was like a surprise, wasn't it?

18:15.640 --> 18:18.600
I hate tactics games, but you're going to try it anyway.

18:18.600 --> 18:19.600
No, I won't.

18:19.600 --> 18:20.600
No.

18:20.600 --> 18:21.600
OK.

18:21.600 --> 18:22.600
I know I don't like tactics games.

18:22.600 --> 18:23.600
I've tried to like tactics games.

18:23.600 --> 18:25.480
I'm like, I'm going to love this game.

18:25.480 --> 18:26.480
I love this.

18:26.480 --> 18:27.480
No, I hate it.

18:27.480 --> 18:28.480
I can't play Fire Emblem.

18:28.480 --> 18:29.480
I can't play.

18:29.920 --> 18:33.720
I tried to love the Macross one back in the day, and I hate them.

18:33.720 --> 18:34.720
See, here's the weird thing.

18:34.720 --> 18:35.720
Like, I'm with you.

18:35.720 --> 18:37.400
Like most tactic games I can't get into.

18:37.400 --> 18:39.200
I have tried to get into Sky Eye.

18:39.200 --> 18:42.880
I've tried to get into Fire Emblem.

18:42.880 --> 18:44.120
I just don't get into it.

18:44.120 --> 18:47.520
But Final Fantasy Tactics, give me more.

18:47.520 --> 18:51.760
Like I would give me another Final Fantasy Tactics like seriously.

18:51.760 --> 18:56.120
The other thing I was really happy about and I saw it and then forgot about it, but I was

18:56.120 --> 19:04.600
still happy, was John Romero doing a game, but I didn't see anything about zombies.

19:04.600 --> 19:06.160
And then Contra Rogue Corps.

19:06.160 --> 19:07.160
Contra.

19:07.160 --> 19:08.160
Yeah.

19:08.160 --> 19:11.880
It looks like hot garbage, but I'll probably play it anyways.

19:11.880 --> 19:13.080
And I don't give a shit about Witcher.

19:13.080 --> 19:18.280
Well, it's done by the same guy that did Contra 3 and one of the other Contra games.

19:18.280 --> 19:20.420
So it's one of the original creators.

19:20.420 --> 19:23.720
So I'm down for that, but it just looks like hot garbage.

19:23.720 --> 19:27.780
But it should be noted that the other big it's out today announcement, because we love

19:27.780 --> 19:29.640
it when Nintendo does those, right?

19:29.640 --> 19:32.320
The other big it's out today is the Contra collection.

19:32.320 --> 19:35.520
So Jamie, if you missed the memo, I mean, you're probably like, I already own all those

19:35.520 --> 19:36.520
games.

19:36.520 --> 19:39.160
But if there's something you're missing in that Contra collection, that all came out

19:39.160 --> 19:40.160
as well.

19:40.160 --> 19:41.160
Just dropped.

19:41.160 --> 19:42.240
It's nice to have it in one place.

19:42.240 --> 19:43.240
I think possibly.

19:43.240 --> 19:49.080
I mean, also I'm a little bit weirded about Luigi's Mansion 3, although I'm looking forward

19:49.080 --> 19:50.760
to co-op because I would play that with Dan.

19:50.800 --> 19:53.120
Do you know how many memes I've seen already about Gooigi?

19:53.120 --> 19:59.200
Anyway, SSG100Matt kind of sums up the new Contra game saying, yeah, that Contra game

19:59.200 --> 20:03.880
looks like it knows what it is and could be totally fun, can't be trash.

20:03.880 --> 20:04.880
That's what Contra 3 was.

20:04.880 --> 20:05.880
I'm actually.

20:05.880 --> 20:06.880
That sounds like me.

20:06.880 --> 20:07.880
Actually, I'm.

20:07.880 --> 20:08.880
I'm totally fun, can't be trash.

20:08.880 --> 20:14.240
You know, if Contra is self-aware like that, and to be fair, there's a playable panda bear

20:14.240 --> 20:15.400
I spotted in that.

20:15.400 --> 20:21.580
So that on the self-aware meter makes me think if Contra is self-aware that it can't be trash,

20:21.580 --> 20:23.240
that actually could be a great thing.

20:23.240 --> 20:24.240
That's Contra 3.

20:24.240 --> 20:28.080
You were jumping from missiles, I mean, from missile to missile.

20:28.080 --> 20:29.080
It was can't be trash.

20:29.080 --> 20:31.240
It's a very kind of Bayonetta thing.

20:31.240 --> 20:32.240
Loki, let me ask you.

20:32.240 --> 20:34.800
I mean, we've we've talked about our faves from Nintendo.

20:34.800 --> 20:35.800
What what caught your eye?

20:35.800 --> 20:36.800
The Contra thing?

20:36.800 --> 20:37.800
When I saw.

20:37.800 --> 20:40.000
OK, I know there was one other thing that had to catch your eye on that.

20:40.000 --> 20:41.000
The No More Heroes.

20:41.000 --> 20:42.000
Yeah, No More Heroes 3.

20:42.000 --> 20:43.000
I don't.

20:43.000 --> 20:44.000
I don't remember two, though.

20:44.600 --> 20:45.600
I played through one.

20:45.600 --> 20:46.600
Yeah.

20:46.600 --> 20:47.600
I think maybe.

20:47.600 --> 20:48.600
No More Heroes 2 did come out.

20:48.600 --> 20:52.440
We need like a collection to come back because I haven't I don't remember them very well.

20:52.440 --> 20:56.160
But yeah, No More Heroes 3 looks crazy.

20:56.160 --> 20:58.160
So that'll be neat.

20:58.160 --> 21:01.400
I was kind of underwhelmed by all of it.

21:01.400 --> 21:04.920
And I know that's a horrible thing to say, but I was underwhelmed by all of it.

21:04.920 --> 21:05.920
It was just kind of.

21:05.920 --> 21:06.920
Did you?

21:06.920 --> 21:07.920
OK.

21:07.920 --> 21:11.420
Did you maybe like I have to admit at the end of it, I was kind of like, oh, you know,

21:11.420 --> 21:12.980
because I want.

21:12.980 --> 21:16.940
It's so weird because, OK, I'm going to get so much shit for this deservedly, but I don't

21:16.940 --> 21:17.940
care.

21:17.940 --> 21:19.820
I'm I'm living my truth.

21:19.820 --> 21:25.020
When they announced the Breath of the Wild sequel, I was kind of like, oh, OK, yeah,

21:25.020 --> 21:26.020
great.

21:26.020 --> 21:27.020
Like, we knew that was going to happen.

21:27.020 --> 21:30.340
Yet another game that we can add to the list that's in development, like Metroid Prime

21:30.340 --> 21:31.340
4, you know?

21:31.340 --> 21:32.340
Yeah.

21:32.340 --> 21:37.540
There was that part of me that was like, I kind of wanted to see more on Bayonetta 3.

21:37.540 --> 21:38.540
I would have loved enough.

21:38.540 --> 21:43.060
Where I hope they put out that Metroid Prime trilogy.

21:43.060 --> 21:47.180
But I like, you know, that was my like initial gut reaction.

21:47.180 --> 21:50.500
But then, like a couple hours later, I really looked back and I said, wait a minute, Rob,

21:50.500 --> 21:52.620
you're doing that thing that you tell people not to do.

21:52.620 --> 21:55.740
Don't set these expectations for things you want to see.

21:55.740 --> 21:57.900
And then when they don't appear, you're just going to get disappointed because I took a

21:57.900 --> 21:58.900
step back and really looked at it.

21:58.900 --> 22:01.300
I was like, you know, Nintendo really did have a fun year.

22:01.300 --> 22:02.300
They had a lot of stuff.

22:02.300 --> 22:04.740
So did what I'm asking you, look, did you maybe make that same mistake?

22:04.740 --> 22:07.180
Did you know I had no expectations?

22:07.180 --> 22:10.940
I had no expectations, but like some of these games, like a Panzer Dragoon remake is like,

22:10.940 --> 22:13.260
it wasn't something I was looking for.

22:13.260 --> 22:17.420
So I didn't really care that they're making it, you know, same with the new Contra game

22:17.420 --> 22:22.780
looked OK, but it was like, oh, my God, I got to play that, you know, it's and I don't

22:22.780 --> 22:24.360
really play Smash too much.

22:24.360 --> 22:27.420
So, of course, they had, you know, the big announcement is Badger Kazooie is in Smash

22:27.420 --> 22:32.460
now as a character, as well as Dragon Quest Hero.

22:32.460 --> 22:33.660
I think you want to add to this, Jamie.

22:33.660 --> 22:37.480
I was just saying if they were going to do Panzer Dragoon, why don't they go and get

22:37.480 --> 22:42.300
what people really want and do Panzer Dragoon Saga or RPG?

22:42.300 --> 22:46.840
Well, maybe, you know, if one does well, it leads to the next kind of like I would say,

22:46.840 --> 22:49.780
because that Secret of Mana remake did well enough, it convinced them, you know, even

22:49.780 --> 22:52.940
if it maybe wasn't here, maybe did better in Japan, I don't know, but I think it did

22:52.940 --> 22:53.940
fine enough here.

22:53.940 --> 22:57.500
I think it did well enough where now they went and they did trials of Mana and we're

22:57.500 --> 22:59.220
getting an English version because of it.

22:59.220 --> 23:00.220
They're taking that effort.

23:00.220 --> 23:04.580
So, I mean, if a game does well, they might be encouraged to do more.

23:04.580 --> 23:08.300
Now I will say this before y'all like drag me about and cancel me about what I just said

23:08.300 --> 23:09.580
about Nintendo.

23:09.580 --> 23:10.740
Here's the thing, though.

23:10.740 --> 23:15.060
Here's what Nintendo does very well with their direct.

23:15.060 --> 23:19.620
And like I give them an A plus on this, honestly, where I don't think Microsoft really does

23:19.620 --> 23:20.620
this.

23:20.620 --> 23:22.700
I don't think Square Enix or any of the other ones we're going to talk about really did

23:22.700 --> 23:23.920
this.

23:23.920 --> 23:29.060
Nintendo did a great job in that I would say maybe like 90% of those trailers save for

23:29.060 --> 23:32.740
maybe like the No More Heroes and a couple others, 90% of those trailers.

23:32.740 --> 23:37.820
And I made up that statistic, but I feel like most of what we saw, you saw gameplay.

23:37.820 --> 23:41.340
You didn't just see a pre-rendered CG announcement thing.

23:41.340 --> 23:43.200
You saw gameplay.

23:43.200 --> 23:46.220
You saw what those games really look like.

23:46.220 --> 23:51.560
And that gets me more excited about the games when I can see, oh, that's the game I'm going

23:51.560 --> 23:52.740
to be playing.

23:52.740 --> 23:55.820
What have I been sitting here bellyaching about Death Stranding for years and years

23:55.820 --> 23:57.040
on this show?

23:57.040 --> 24:02.680
As rad as it is, as great as this cast looks, as much as I love Hideo Kojima, where's the

24:02.680 --> 24:03.680
fucking game?

24:03.680 --> 24:08.320
And they did, they did finally show it to us, but still I have this sense of, I'm not

24:08.320 --> 24:13.520
sure what it really looks like, you know, I'll probably buy it anyway because Kojima,

24:13.520 --> 24:15.560
but what is the game?

24:15.560 --> 24:16.560
You know?

24:16.560 --> 24:22.080
So anyway, I love that Nintendo shows the game and I give them major props for that.

24:22.080 --> 24:23.080
I do.

24:23.080 --> 24:24.080
So.

24:24.080 --> 24:25.880
I'm not saying it was bad.

24:25.880 --> 24:30.240
I'm just saying that like, I'm not entirely excited about all the stuff that they have.

24:30.240 --> 24:34.840
Animal Crossing looks okay, but like I, my expectations for Animal Crossing aren't very

24:34.840 --> 24:35.840
high either.

24:35.840 --> 24:40.200
It's just, I'll play it when it comes out, but like, I don't know, there wasn't really

24:40.200 --> 24:45.480
anything that had me jumping up and down like, oh my God, I need to buy this, you know, whatever.

24:45.480 --> 24:46.640
It's fine.

24:46.640 --> 24:49.400
That's how I kind of buy things on the Switch anyways.

24:49.400 --> 24:52.480
Now SSGL 100 Matt says something that I kind of agree with too.

24:52.480 --> 24:56.000
I was really disappointed that there wasn't any Nintendo online news.

24:56.000 --> 24:59.920
I really hope they were going to be saying, yeah, yeah, that is kind of disappointing,

24:59.920 --> 25:03.800
but Bobby has a really good point and I was disappointed at first too, but then I kind

25:03.800 --> 25:08.560
of took a step back and realized they could kind of do a direct about that whenever they

25:08.560 --> 25:10.940
want and people will still receive it.

25:10.940 --> 25:13.400
And I think Bobby kind of hits the nail on the head here.

25:13.400 --> 25:16.800
Bobby says, I think September is when we'll get that.

25:16.800 --> 25:20.680
So people resubscribe because people bought their Nintendo online for a year.

25:20.680 --> 25:24.080
Now in September, Nintendo is going to be tasked with, now we need you to renew for

25:24.080 --> 25:25.080
another year.

25:25.080 --> 25:29.400
So I think any big announcements and things along the line of other freebies like Tetris

25:29.400 --> 25:35.320
99, and there's the, I think, which I would bet with the success of Tetris 99, Nintendo's

25:35.320 --> 25:38.360
got to be looking at and going, what else can we put?

25:38.360 --> 25:42.960
What if I says 100 and that, okay, here's here, you ready?

25:42.960 --> 25:46.640
You're ready for my pie in the sky dreamboat thing that Nintendo, I really want them to

25:46.640 --> 25:52.840
do an NES remix, super multiplayer about it.

25:52.840 --> 25:53.840
I like a new one.

25:53.840 --> 25:54.920
Think about it.

25:54.920 --> 25:55.920
Super NES remix.

25:55.920 --> 25:56.920
Yeah.

25:56.920 --> 25:58.920
Maybe, maybe to go with it anyway.

25:58.920 --> 26:02.040
Um, let's see, uh, what else did I want to mention?

26:02.040 --> 26:05.400
There was, I thought there was one other thing from the, Oh yes, the one other huge game

26:05.400 --> 26:06.760
none of us talked about.

26:06.760 --> 26:09.460
We talked about the link, uh, breath of the wild sequel.

26:09.460 --> 26:13.320
We did not talk about all that they showed with the links awakening remake.

26:13.320 --> 26:14.320
That's coming out.

26:14.320 --> 26:15.320
It's pretty interesting.

26:15.320 --> 26:16.320
I love the art style.

26:17.320 --> 26:21.640
And I love that they added that little, I don't want to call it a Mario maker mode,

26:21.640 --> 26:25.840
but they definitely added like the customizable dungeon, which, you know, doesn't seem like

26:25.840 --> 26:30.600
it's Oh my God, like all this customizability, but it's enough to kind of make you go, Oh,

26:30.600 --> 26:31.600
that's neat.

26:31.600 --> 26:33.560
You know, like, Oh, that's an additional, that's something new, you know, something

26:33.560 --> 26:35.200
to add to the table to remake.

26:35.200 --> 26:36.720
And I thought that was really cool.

26:36.720 --> 26:38.240
I mean, I'm going to pick this game up.

26:38.240 --> 26:39.240
Hello.

26:39.240 --> 26:44.820
I like these, like 2.5 Z Zelda's are like, or 2.5 D Zelda's are like my favorite.

26:44.820 --> 26:46.380
So I'm going to definitely pick it up.

26:46.380 --> 26:47.740
I mean, no question.

26:47.740 --> 26:48.740
And Mario maker too.

26:48.740 --> 26:49.740
Hello.

26:49.740 --> 26:50.740
I'm buying it.

26:50.740 --> 26:51.740
Of course.

26:51.740 --> 26:52.740
Yeah, of course.

26:52.740 --> 26:53.740
But I'm glad they didn't spend a lot of time on that.

26:53.740 --> 26:57.700
The one I thought they spent maybe a little too much time on was, um, the dragon quest

26:57.700 --> 26:58.700
builders too.

26:58.700 --> 27:02.700
Cause we kind of knew that was coming and you know, we already kind of know and we just

27:02.700 --> 27:04.460
saw it previously at screening.

27:04.460 --> 27:08.080
The one good thing though, that did come out of that whole, uh, tree house thing is they

27:08.080 --> 27:11.020
did walk back their decision on multiplayer.

27:11.020 --> 27:13.040
Oh, good call.

27:13.040 --> 27:14.040
They did.

27:14.040 --> 27:18.360
They're going to allow, you know, you'd be able to play with friends online as well in

27:18.360 --> 27:19.600
unranked matches.

27:19.600 --> 27:23.320
So that's going to be coming after launch, but it is something that's coming.

27:23.320 --> 27:24.320
Yeah.

27:24.320 --> 27:25.320
All right.

27:25.320 --> 27:29.200
And then we had a little more information on Pokemon sword and shield as well, but a

27:29.200 --> 27:32.840
lot of that during the direct, when they were showing them a lot of that, uh, I'm sorry,

27:32.840 --> 27:37.600
the tree house, when they were showing some of that, like the, um, I can't poke ball plus

27:37.600 --> 27:38.600
none.

27:38.600 --> 27:40.560
Well, yeah, there's that, but I'm thinking what the, Oh my God.

27:40.560 --> 27:43.880
Now I can't remember the name and I already hear Shane screaming at me somewhere at the

27:43.920 --> 27:45.360
little Corgi with a heart on its butt.

27:45.360 --> 27:46.360
Yeah.

27:46.360 --> 27:47.360
What was the name?

27:47.360 --> 27:48.360
The cute thing.

27:48.360 --> 27:49.360
Yeah.

27:49.360 --> 27:50.360
Oh my God.

27:50.360 --> 27:51.360
That thing was so adorable.

27:51.360 --> 27:52.360
Yipper.

27:52.360 --> 27:53.360
Yapper.

27:53.360 --> 27:54.360
Something like that.

27:54.360 --> 27:55.360
Adorable.

27:55.360 --> 27:56.360
So that was cool.

27:56.360 --> 27:58.080
But I know there's a little controversy going on with Pokemon as well, but stay tuned.

27:58.080 --> 28:00.120
We're going to address that a little bit later in the show.

28:00.120 --> 28:01.120
So yeah.

28:01.120 --> 28:02.120
All right.

28:02.120 --> 28:03.120
Um, so Yamper, thank you.

28:03.120 --> 28:04.120
Act.

28:04.120 --> 28:05.120
I knew somebody in chat.

28:05.120 --> 28:06.120
We know Yamper.

28:06.120 --> 28:07.120
I was clear.

28:07.120 --> 28:08.120
Yelper.

28:08.120 --> 28:09.120
Old Yeller.

28:09.120 --> 28:10.120
Old Yelper.

28:10.120 --> 28:11.120
All right.

28:11.360 --> 28:12.360
Uh, yeah.

28:12.360 --> 28:14.480
And SSG100 Matt points out the sheep Pokemon.

28:14.480 --> 28:15.480
Yeah.

28:15.480 --> 28:16.480
The Wooloo.

28:16.480 --> 28:17.480
That looked really cute too.

28:17.480 --> 28:22.280
Although, you know, we've already had sheep Pokemon, so we had a Mareep, poor Mareep rest

28:22.280 --> 28:23.280
in peace.

28:23.280 --> 28:24.280
All right.

28:24.280 --> 28:25.280
Anyway.

28:25.280 --> 28:26.280
Uh, let's move on.

28:26.280 --> 28:27.280
There were other conferences as well.

28:27.280 --> 28:28.280
Right.

28:28.280 --> 28:30.720
Uh, the night before we had Square Enix's event.

28:30.720 --> 28:31.720
Yeah.

28:31.720 --> 28:36.360
So just quickly, I want to say, um, Bobby and I did that thing we mentioned last week.

28:36.360 --> 28:37.600
We did our, Oh, you were watching.

28:37.600 --> 28:38.600
I was watching.

28:38.600 --> 28:39.600
What'd you think?

28:39.600 --> 28:40.600
I thought it was good.

28:41.080 --> 28:45.240
So that's, it doesn't just have to be me and Bobby to someday me and you can do it someday.

28:45.240 --> 28:46.560
You and her can do it.

28:46.560 --> 28:50.720
You know, we can, we, we have the technology to be able to do those impromptu shows.

28:50.720 --> 28:51.720
I was surprised.

28:51.720 --> 28:57.840
Our chatters seem to be really into it because what I tried to do is I tried to not be cynical

28:57.840 --> 28:59.120
about it.

28:59.120 --> 29:03.140
And I think that goes a long way with people because too many times we look at live streams

29:03.140 --> 29:07.800
and there's, there's people going like, Oh, this sucks or this is trash or this is garbage

29:07.960 --> 29:12.200
or let's take the camera into the bathroom and like all these like trashy things.

29:12.200 --> 29:13.200
Right.

29:13.200 --> 29:19.920
So I, well, we did, sorry if I join in, you know, something positive.

29:19.920 --> 29:20.920
It's not going to be positive.

29:20.920 --> 29:24.080
I'm going to have, you know what, I'm only going to allow you on a stream like that.

29:24.080 --> 29:28.380
If I get a little, what the buzzer that comes with the board game taboo.

29:28.380 --> 29:34.360
And every time you negative, I get to go, that poor battery is going to be burnt to

29:34.360 --> 29:35.360
Chris.

29:35.360 --> 29:36.360
What do you guys think?

29:36.360 --> 29:46.200
We're going to hit the buzzer and the batteries are drained by the end of the night.

29:46.200 --> 29:51.040
Oh yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

29:51.040 --> 29:53.040
And Oh, and no from Bobby.

29:53.040 --> 29:56.320
Well, so far yeses are in the lead.

29:56.320 --> 30:00.400
Bobby's going to need that for anytime Rob calls into a show because you never know.

30:00.400 --> 30:04.200
You know, I dropped the F bomb on the Bobby Blackwell show tonight when he tries to keep

30:04.200 --> 30:06.040
his show very clean.

30:06.040 --> 30:07.040
And I made a booboo.

30:07.040 --> 30:10.680
I slipped up because it was after six o'clock and like the gremlins, you don't feed them

30:10.680 --> 30:12.960
after midnight or they might drop an F bomb.

30:12.960 --> 30:13.960
All right.

30:13.960 --> 30:15.960
Anyway, let's, let's talk about the Square Enix thing.

30:15.960 --> 30:16.960
Actually, let me ask dark Sakura.

30:16.960 --> 30:19.520
I don't know if you saw, I know you were busy with work and stuff.

30:19.520 --> 30:22.400
Did you see any of the stuff out of the Square Enix event?

30:22.400 --> 30:24.280
The Avengers thing is pretty interesting.

30:24.280 --> 30:30.520
It looks nothing like them, but I was really into final fantasy seven really into it.

30:30.520 --> 30:31.520
Yeah.

30:31.520 --> 30:32.520
Doesn't the remake look good?

30:32.840 --> 30:36.040
Honestly though, I don't like Barrett's voice.

30:36.040 --> 30:41.960
I mean, it just, it sounds like it's trying to be a tough voice, but it sounds like it's

30:41.960 --> 30:43.240
trying to be a tough voice.

30:43.240 --> 30:44.240
You know what I mean?

30:44.240 --> 30:45.680
But Tifa and Cloud sound great.

30:45.680 --> 30:46.680
Okay.

30:46.680 --> 30:50.840
But if, if we're talking about seven and the remake and getting to see things in HD, how

30:50.840 --> 30:54.040
are your feelings about Aerith?

30:54.040 --> 31:02.480
I still hate her, but did you notice how much it seemed to focus on Cloud and Tifa?

31:03.440 --> 31:05.360
Why did they change?

31:05.360 --> 31:06.360
What happens?

31:06.360 --> 31:09.600
Oh, no, she has to die.

31:09.600 --> 31:11.280
Oh, no, no, no.

31:11.280 --> 31:12.280
You forget.

31:12.280 --> 31:14.080
She actually has to die for the plot.

31:14.080 --> 31:15.560
You need to take that thought out of the universe.

31:15.560 --> 31:18.560
I want you to pick up that thought and take it out of the universe.

31:18.560 --> 31:21.360
You throw that thought away in the garbage disposal.

31:21.360 --> 31:22.360
The Resurrector.

31:22.360 --> 31:26.360
It's just J-100 Matt says, buzz him now.

31:26.360 --> 31:27.360
Too late.

31:27.360 --> 31:28.360
All right.

31:28.360 --> 31:29.360
Anyway, sorry, dark Sakura.

31:29.640 --> 31:32.640
One other thing I did notice dark Sakura was that they did, for what it's worth, they did

31:32.640 --> 31:38.440
call her Aerith in the English language version, so they must not be changing your name this

31:38.440 --> 31:39.440
time.

31:39.440 --> 31:40.440
Well, honestly, that's how it should be.

31:40.440 --> 31:41.440
Right.

31:41.440 --> 31:43.560
But Sephiroth sounded a little weird.

31:43.560 --> 31:45.320
I didn't like Sephiroth either.

31:45.320 --> 31:48.840
That was probably my biggest criticism too, but the gameplay like, seriously, it's like

31:48.840 --> 31:53.080
they took Final Fantasy 15's engine, which we all knew that's what was happening, right?

31:53.080 --> 31:54.080
And they made it better.

31:54.080 --> 31:57.840
Like, they really like, oh man, I, that's the one thing I really wish I could have gone

31:57.840 --> 32:01.640
to LA and played was that, but you know, my friends that are down, that were down there

32:01.640 --> 32:04.720
and got their hands on it say, this is, this is great.

32:04.720 --> 32:10.960
It's just, it's weird to me that this is basically Final Fantasy 16.

32:10.960 --> 32:13.880
And if, and if Delvin was here right now, he'd be telling me, I've been telling you

32:13.880 --> 32:14.920
that.

32:14.920 --> 32:18.840
And I don't think they're, they're not going to call it like 16, 17 and 18 because call

32:18.840 --> 32:20.320
it Final Fantasy 16.

32:20.320 --> 32:25.580
But basically the reason why we haven't seen a Final Fantasy 16 is because this is it.

32:25.580 --> 32:27.580
They're putting everything into this.

32:27.580 --> 32:32.460
That would have been going into a Final Fantasy 16, including, yeah, multiple, like a Final

32:32.460 --> 32:38.580
Fantasy 16, 16, two and 16, three clearly, because as we heard, the first episode is

32:38.580 --> 32:42.600
nothing but Midgar and it's two Blu-rays.

32:42.600 --> 32:46.460
So clearly they are going to expand on the story crazy.

32:46.460 --> 32:47.960
They have to be.

32:47.960 --> 32:53.180
And so my poor bandwidth cap and I, I can't, oh man, fuck you for putting that thought

32:53.180 --> 32:57.540
out there because now I'm like, what if they do change major plot points?

32:57.540 --> 32:58.540
Like what if they do too?

32:58.540 --> 32:59.540
I don't think they changed that one.

32:59.540 --> 33:04.520
I think that one is like, oh my God, there would be protests outside of Square Enix headquarters

33:04.520 --> 33:10.780
led by her, but I'd be out there with my sign.

33:10.780 --> 33:11.780
Yeah.

33:11.780 --> 33:13.780
Let me put more evil into the universe.

33:13.780 --> 33:16.220
What if there's multiple endings?

33:16.220 --> 33:22.740
One you get the killer and one she's stays around and lives the, actually I don't hate

33:22.780 --> 33:23.860
you as much for that.

33:23.860 --> 33:25.920
It's not the whole killer and lives thing.

33:25.920 --> 33:31.020
The multiple ending thing though, we have to address Final Fantasy seven's kind of crappy

33:31.020 --> 33:32.020
ending.

33:32.020 --> 33:33.520
That is going to have to be addressed in the remake.

33:33.520 --> 33:37.200
And I do fully expect, you know, it's, we're about 10 years from finding out what it's

33:37.200 --> 33:38.980
going to be by the time we get there.

33:38.980 --> 33:44.840
But I expect them to address the ending of Final Fantasy and multiple endings.

33:44.840 --> 33:45.840
Why not?

33:45.840 --> 33:50.580
Why not a good ending where you see the red 13, who by the way was very much absent from

33:50.580 --> 33:51.580
that preview.

33:52.500 --> 33:56.360
What if we see the red 30, you know, you guys, I'm, I'm talking about a game from the nineties,

33:56.360 --> 34:00.480
so I hope it's not spoilers at this point, but if you watch during the credits, you see

34:00.480 --> 34:06.200
red 13 run out into, and see a Midgar where the life is back and the plants I've grown

34:06.200 --> 34:07.200
around it.

34:07.200 --> 34:09.160
And that is like, kind of like the true ending in many ways.

34:09.160 --> 34:12.800
And that was the best part of the ending in my opinion, um, cause the rest of it didn't

34:12.800 --> 34:16.480
make a lot of God damn sense, but, um, maybe there may be something like that would be

34:16.480 --> 34:17.480
expanded on.

34:17.480 --> 34:19.360
You see more if you get the good ending.

34:19.380 --> 34:24.140
I just hope that they incorporate, um, some of the, uh, Advent children's stuff because

34:24.140 --> 34:25.580
that movie is bad-ass.

34:25.580 --> 34:29.380
I just hope they let you skip the fucking summon animations finally.

34:29.380 --> 34:30.380
Knights of the round.

34:30.380 --> 34:31.380
No, no, no, no.

34:31.380 --> 34:37.740
I want to be able to pick and choose to skip like, because if I need to go to the bathroom

34:37.740 --> 34:42.020
during the end of the game, I want to be able to do some Knights of the round, Quadra magic

34:42.020 --> 34:43.820
and mimic or whatever.

34:43.820 --> 34:48.700
So I can go have a decent pee break and come back and have it still finishing.

34:48.720 --> 34:52.880
I have made a sandwich during the process of that entire thing.

34:52.880 --> 34:57.020
Akuma JP putting his thoughts on the ending out in our chat room at twitch.tv slash vog

34:57.020 --> 35:00.640
network saying, no, no, that was to show red is not extinct.

35:00.640 --> 35:01.720
He got kids.

35:01.720 --> 35:02.720
That is true.

35:02.720 --> 35:06.680
You could see his child in that little sequence to children has been a long time in that sequence

35:06.680 --> 35:07.680
too.

35:07.680 --> 35:10.680
So, I mean, there's many, many conclusions and many things you can draw out of the ending.

35:10.680 --> 35:11.680
That's for sure.

35:11.680 --> 35:16.320
As children under Matt says one Blu-ray disc is just the data for the summons.

35:16.320 --> 35:17.400
Here's hoping.

35:17.400 --> 35:23.100
Here's hoping I that Shiva animation better scream gay pride.

35:23.100 --> 35:24.100
Yes.

35:24.100 --> 35:27.060
I wish you could see the face Jamie just made.

35:27.060 --> 35:28.060
That's uh huh.

35:28.060 --> 35:29.060
Yeah.

35:29.060 --> 35:32.100
Cause like when Shiva comes out and snaps her fingers, I want to be left shooketh.

35:32.100 --> 35:33.100
Hold on.

35:33.100 --> 35:36.100
Can you see me?

35:36.100 --> 35:37.100
Yes.

35:37.100 --> 35:40.260
That that's the face she made.

35:40.260 --> 35:41.940
Even even Loki is kind of smart.

35:41.940 --> 35:42.940
Yep.

35:42.940 --> 35:47.220
When she, when she comes out and does her thing, I want it to be like, I just like,

35:47.220 --> 35:55.240
I, and, and lady Gaga appears on a giant Mac and every, like, it's just, and there's

35:55.240 --> 35:56.240
a parade.

35:56.240 --> 35:57.240
Yes.

35:57.240 --> 35:58.240
That's what I want.

35:58.240 --> 35:59.240
And there's a parade.

35:59.240 --> 36:05.820
I can just picture that actually see like, you know, look, look, you can have all the

36:05.820 --> 36:06.820
other summons.

36:06.820 --> 36:07.820
Okay.

36:07.820 --> 36:08.820
Okay.

36:08.820 --> 36:12.720
Straight people can have Knights of the round and E free and whatever black, but we get

36:12.720 --> 36:13.880
the diva.

36:13.880 --> 36:14.880
Let me have Shiva.

36:15.300 --> 36:17.300
Let my people have Shiva.

36:17.300 --> 36:18.300
Okay.

36:18.300 --> 36:19.300
Anyway.

36:19.300 --> 36:25.460
And Shiva, by the way, drag queen, wasn't 13 that Shiva was on a motor or was Shiva

36:25.460 --> 36:27.460
sisters on the motorbikes.

36:27.460 --> 36:28.460
Yes.

36:28.460 --> 36:29.460
Yeah.

36:29.460 --> 36:30.460
Yeah.

36:30.460 --> 36:31.460
All right.

36:31.460 --> 36:41.300
Anyway, tell us about some other things we saw at the square enix event, Loki, uh, final

36:41.300 --> 36:44.440
fancy crystal Chronicles remastered edition.

36:44.440 --> 36:45.440
Yeah.

36:45.440 --> 36:49.840
I it's, it's kind of interesting to see that like, um, without the game boy advance and

36:49.840 --> 36:52.240
the, the complicated setup that that required.

36:52.240 --> 36:54.000
Um, but I'm, I'm kinda into it.

36:54.000 --> 36:55.720
I'd like to check out that game again.

36:55.720 --> 36:59.560
Last remnants being remastered as well, which is okay.

36:59.560 --> 37:02.480
And we kind of knew that was happening cause the other one got delisted.

37:02.480 --> 37:03.480
Yeah.

37:03.480 --> 37:06.360
Uh, dragon quest builders two looked okay.

37:06.360 --> 37:10.880
The first game is a lot of fun and it looks like they really amped up what you could do

37:10.880 --> 37:13.020
creatively in the second one.

37:13.020 --> 37:15.060
I'm definitely interested in the second one.

37:15.060 --> 37:17.300
I just feel like there's so many other games to play.

37:17.300 --> 37:20.980
I feel like it's one of those games that's going to get lost in the shuffle, but I, I

37:20.980 --> 37:22.940
feel like I owe it to myself to check it out at least.

37:22.940 --> 37:24.380
Cause the first game is a lot of fun.

37:24.380 --> 37:27.260
I, I didn't beat it, but I played a lot of it.

37:27.260 --> 37:29.900
Is it part of the Xbox game passing?

37:29.900 --> 37:32.900
So maybe we should talk about that real quick.

37:32.900 --> 37:33.900
Actually a little tan.

37:33.900 --> 37:34.900
You ready for a tangent?

37:34.900 --> 37:38.460
I do not believe it's part of the Xbox game pass, but we did talk about Microsoft last

37:38.460 --> 37:39.460
week.

37:39.460 --> 37:40.460
Right?

37:41.040 --> 37:43.960
Um, you know, cause I wouldn't have, because I didn't do it till my new Tuesday.

37:43.960 --> 37:47.040
I bought the Xbox Xbox game pass ultimate.

37:47.040 --> 37:53.600
Um, I, they, they had a great deal where just for a dollar, you can upgrade your existing

37:53.600 --> 37:58.640
go for, I don't know how long it goes for, but see, Bobby did the smarter thing.

37:58.640 --> 38:02.240
I didn't, I didn't realize, I thought it was just a dollar for the first month and that's

38:02.240 --> 38:03.240
all I was getting.

38:03.240 --> 38:04.240
And I was okay with that.

38:04.240 --> 38:06.000
I was prepared to pay the 15 a month or whatever.

38:06.000 --> 38:10.360
And I, I saw some chart that talked about converting gold time to, so I didn't think

38:10.360 --> 38:13.460
it was going to be one for one, but I paid the dollar and it's like, okay.

38:13.460 --> 38:16.480
So is that dollar per month or is it a dollar a dollar?

38:16.480 --> 38:20.500
And then it said your next billing date, March, 2020, because that's when my current Xbox

38:20.500 --> 38:21.500
live was set to expire.

38:21.500 --> 38:25.060
And I was like, Oh my God, I could have padded that out like with a cart.

38:25.060 --> 38:26.980
And that's exactly what Bobby Black Wolf did.

38:26.980 --> 38:30.620
He went and he pad, I guess it won't let you pad it out more than three years.

38:30.620 --> 38:35.060
So don't buy too much Xbox live, but you go buy like, just buy like a two year card, pad

38:35.060 --> 38:38.540
out your Xbox live, then pay the dollar to upgrade and you're going to be happy.

38:38.600 --> 38:43.480
But you know your results may vary, read the fine print, make sure that promotion is still

38:43.480 --> 38:47.440
going because I'm sure as Microsoft realizes more and more people are figuring this out,

38:47.440 --> 38:49.640
they're going to pull the plug on that.

38:49.640 --> 38:53.700
But I just, yeah, but anyway, I mean, I was fully prepared to pay the 15 a month after

38:53.700 --> 38:56.760
this month and I would have done it.

38:56.760 --> 39:00.360
And yeah, I, so, so when I get to my gaming week, I'll talk about some of the games I've

39:00.360 --> 39:02.240
been able to play as a result of that.

39:02.240 --> 39:07.560
But yeah, I think that's worth noting is that Microsoft did convince me to get on this game

39:07.560 --> 39:11.820
pass ultimate thing because it's kind of what I was hoping for from Stadia that I didn't

39:11.820 --> 39:12.820
get.

39:12.820 --> 39:14.820
So I'm going to put my stock in the Microsoft thing.

39:14.820 --> 39:18.780
Yeah, I think Microsoft's getting a lot right for the future, so we'll see.

39:18.780 --> 39:22.660
I'm so curious to see how Sony responds to it next year.

39:22.660 --> 39:23.660
We'll see.

39:23.660 --> 39:24.660
Anyway, sorry.

39:24.660 --> 39:25.660
Back to Squeenix.

39:25.660 --> 39:34.500
They showed off a Dragon Quest 11 Echoes or S Echoes of an Elusive Age.

39:34.500 --> 39:38.560
Yes, the Definitive Edition where now I'm kind of pissed off I bought the first version

39:38.560 --> 39:41.300
because this other one seems like it has so much more.

39:41.300 --> 39:48.400
You can flip between the classic Dragon Quest and it has the redone music, which the original

39:48.400 --> 39:51.000
game badly needed, let me tell you, and so on.

39:51.000 --> 39:55.240
So I'm kind of mad that I'm probably going to buy this again.

39:55.240 --> 39:56.240
Let's see.

39:56.240 --> 40:01.520
They showed off the expansion for Final Fantasy 14 a little bit, Shadowbringers.

40:01.520 --> 40:02.520
That was cool.

40:02.520 --> 40:03.520
Don't get me wrong.

40:03.540 --> 40:09.380
Final Fantasy 14, but I feel like they spent a lot of time on that when it's like literally

40:09.380 --> 40:13.540
out in like less than three weeks.

40:13.540 --> 40:19.260
Romancing Saga 3 and Scarlet Grace.

40:19.260 --> 40:22.660
Also they showed off a little bit of gameplay for Dying Light 2, which has been a while

40:22.660 --> 40:25.740
since they've shown that.

40:25.740 --> 40:28.460
War of Visions, Final Fantasy Brave Exvius.

40:28.460 --> 40:32.180
Oh yeah, that was the tactical spinoff of the mobile game.

40:32.180 --> 40:33.180
Yeah.

40:34.160 --> 40:40.240
It is not the same as Final Fantasy Tactics, so I'm not interested in playing it on mobile

40:40.240 --> 40:41.240
at the end of the day.

40:41.240 --> 40:44.920
There's a game called Outriders by the people that did Bulletstorm.

40:44.920 --> 40:50.160
Oh yeah, that looked like an Eidos type of thing when Square purchased that.

40:50.160 --> 40:53.920
So yeah, that looked alright for people that are into that.

40:53.920 --> 40:56.040
Final Fantasy VIII remaster.

40:56.040 --> 41:00.300
I think a lot of people excited about the VIII remaster, so you're probably wondering

41:00.320 --> 41:07.720
because I'm somewhat known and disliked sometimes for saying that Final Fantasy VIII is my least

41:07.720 --> 41:10.960
favorite in the entire franchise.

41:10.960 --> 41:15.560
However I'm very happy for the fans of Final Fantasy VIII that they get this remaster.

41:15.560 --> 41:18.800
As long as it's not as fucking grindy.

41:18.800 --> 41:20.760
Well that's the thing is that, here's the thing.

41:20.760 --> 41:24.320
My problem with Final Fantasy VIII was never the story or the characters.

41:24.320 --> 41:28.100
I actually think all of that is great and would have made for an amazing movie if Final

41:28.100 --> 41:30.000
Fantasy had gone that direction.

41:30.000 --> 41:34.660
It's the drawing magic, the junctioning magic, and that whole system is just broken.

41:34.660 --> 41:40.820
And having that system in a game where you can't outlevel the monsters as well, it doesn't

41:40.820 --> 41:42.640
work for me at all.

41:42.640 --> 41:47.180
And so I'm kind of like, I don't see how a remaster is going to fix that for me.

41:47.180 --> 41:51.920
But granted the PC version had that change where you could just instantly draw a 99 to

41:51.920 --> 41:55.300
1 spell, you know, so you kind of cheat a little bit through the game.

41:55.300 --> 41:56.300
So I don't know, I'm undecided.

41:56.600 --> 42:02.660
It kind of depends what price they put it out for, but for the sake of the fans that

42:02.660 --> 42:06.620
always tell me I'm being unfair when it comes to Final Fantasy VIII, I'm willing to give

42:06.620 --> 42:08.240
this a shot.

42:08.240 --> 42:10.240
So to be continued.

42:10.240 --> 42:14.740
And the one I was looking forward to was Marvel's Avengers, which they showed off some gameplay

42:14.740 --> 42:17.640
for that, but I don't know.

42:17.640 --> 42:22.400
The gameplay didn't look all that exciting and I'm a little put off by the way the characters

42:22.400 --> 42:23.400
look.

42:23.500 --> 42:24.660
I know I get it.

42:24.660 --> 42:26.600
It's not supposed to be the cinematic universe.

42:26.600 --> 42:31.000
I'm fine with that because we've had, you know, other designs in other games that have

42:31.000 --> 42:32.000
been fine.

42:32.000 --> 42:36.080
But something's just really kind of weird looking at it, but they have like a really

42:36.080 --> 42:37.400
good voice cast for it.

42:37.400 --> 42:39.160
So I'll be willing to give it a shot.

42:39.160 --> 42:44.200
Just like if I have to look at Marvel's Avengers versus like Marvel Ultimate Alliance, I'm

42:44.200 --> 42:47.720
kind of leaning a little bit more towards Marvel Ultimate Alliance 3.

42:47.720 --> 42:49.120
The Ultimate Alliance games have always been good.

42:49.120 --> 42:51.600
Yeah, we didn't even bring that up in Nintendo's event.

42:51.600 --> 42:53.320
They showed Marvel Ultimate Alliance 3.

42:53.320 --> 42:54.320
Hello.

42:54.320 --> 42:56.320
Well, I guess we talked about that before.

42:56.320 --> 43:00.080
But still to see it in action, hear about the DLC, see just how many characters are

43:00.080 --> 43:01.080
in it.

43:01.080 --> 43:02.080
That was pretty cool.

43:02.080 --> 43:03.080
Yeah.

43:03.080 --> 43:04.080
So I don't know.

43:04.080 --> 43:07.560
I mean, I'll check it out, but it's just the premise doesn't have me like, Oh my God, I

43:07.560 --> 43:09.240
really need to play this.

43:09.240 --> 43:10.240
Here's the thing.

43:10.240 --> 43:11.240
It's I didn't dislike it.

43:11.240 --> 43:13.480
In fact, as it was going, I was like, OK, this is pretty neat.

43:13.480 --> 43:14.480
Like I'm into it.

43:14.480 --> 43:22.560
But I fully realize they can't have the the characters in the Avengers look like the movie

43:22.560 --> 43:23.560
side.

43:23.560 --> 43:24.560
Yeah, I'm fine with that.

43:24.560 --> 43:29.720
And they spent a lot of time trying to justify that it was a different universe and it's

43:29.720 --> 43:31.080
not the characters you're used to.

43:31.080 --> 43:35.400
In fact, I kind of feel like they spent too much time trying to justify it because there

43:35.400 --> 43:38.560
was that whole sequence where they had like Troy Baker and Nolan North and the other voice

43:38.560 --> 43:42.840
actors sit down and they're like, yeah, Bruce Banner, he's kind of like this character that

43:42.840 --> 43:43.840
da da da.

43:43.840 --> 43:48.440
And it's like, OK, as much as I love these voice actors, as talented as they are, I don't

43:48.440 --> 43:52.840
need to hear them recite characters we already know to me, because I think the reason why

43:52.840 --> 43:58.040
they did that is they were really trying to show it's these versions of the characters.

43:58.040 --> 44:00.440
We have a separate version of these characters.

44:00.440 --> 44:04.280
What I would have preferred to see is just let the game do the talking.

44:04.280 --> 44:07.580
Yeah, let the game do the talking, because then when they came out on stage and they

44:07.580 --> 44:10.880
started to talk more about, oh, it's going to be like there's going to be co-op and it's

44:10.880 --> 44:14.000
going to be a persistent experience and you're going to have these generated quests that

44:14.000 --> 44:15.000
you can do.

44:15.000 --> 44:17.120
I was like, I would like to know more.

44:17.120 --> 44:18.120
Are you going to show me?

44:18.120 --> 44:19.120
No.

44:19.120 --> 44:20.120
Oh, OK.

44:20.120 --> 44:21.120
And you're not.

44:21.120 --> 44:22.120
OK, fine.

44:22.120 --> 44:26.080
So I'll just have to wait and see when they it comes closer to coming out, which is next

44:26.080 --> 44:27.080
May.

44:27.080 --> 44:31.240
So, I don't know, just right now, it's just I'm not that excited about it.

44:31.240 --> 44:36.300
I was really looking forward to it when it was coming out, but I don't know.

44:36.300 --> 44:37.300
It's fine.

44:37.300 --> 44:38.300
Yeah.

44:38.300 --> 44:39.300
So the movie has some comments.

44:39.300 --> 44:41.300
There's some really good comments in chat.

44:41.300 --> 44:44.220
Kaijuto in chat just flat out says Avengers looks like trash.

44:44.220 --> 44:48.180
I just want a sandbox superhero or Marvel game.

44:48.180 --> 44:52.220
Mistake Theory says the six Tomb Raider games they made were just so good.

44:52.220 --> 44:56.360
I can't help but think they had to have brought some of that greatness over to the Avengers.

44:56.360 --> 44:57.760
And I'm kind of with you there, too.

44:57.760 --> 45:01.200
Like I'm I'm not going to write this game off yet.

45:01.200 --> 45:05.460
I'm just kind of like my reaction to this whole thing was cool story.

45:05.460 --> 45:08.060
Can't wait to see the game.

45:09.060 --> 45:10.060
And then I'll make some decisions.

45:10.060 --> 45:11.060
Yeah.

45:11.060 --> 45:12.060
I mean, it's we've got lots of time.

45:12.060 --> 45:13.060
You didn't see enough.

45:13.060 --> 45:16.100
S.J.A. 100 Matt in chat says I don't hate the designs at all.

45:16.100 --> 45:19.940
And I understood from the get go that this was not going to be MCU related.

45:19.940 --> 45:23.860
But I think when you combine gamers and comic fans both hate everything.

45:23.860 --> 45:28.660
And the fact that Endgame is so fresh in everyone's mind that folks are upset.

45:28.660 --> 45:31.940
People will get over the designs when the game comes out and it's good.

45:31.940 --> 45:32.940
And that's yeah.

45:32.940 --> 45:33.940
Let the game do the talking.

45:33.940 --> 45:37.140
If the game is really good, let the game do the talking because I feel like a lot of that

45:37.220 --> 45:41.380
was just justifying this isn't the Avengers you're used to.

45:41.380 --> 45:43.680
It's going to be our version and our version.

45:43.680 --> 45:49.820
Super cool because we got Nolan North and and OK, I'm sure it's let the game do the

45:49.820 --> 45:50.820
talking.

45:50.820 --> 45:55.460
You know, you could you could have you could have who I'm trying to think of like really

45:55.460 --> 45:59.460
terrible voice actors that you could have Lance Bass, Gilbert Gottfried, Mandy Moore.

45:59.460 --> 46:06.700
You could have Gilbert Gottfried voicing Black Widow and if the game is really good, it won't

46:07.260 --> 46:08.260
matter.

46:08.260 --> 46:09.260
You know what I mean?

46:09.260 --> 46:11.700
So that's that's all I'm saying.

46:11.700 --> 46:15.140
And no, just no disrespect to those fine, talented voice actors.

46:15.140 --> 46:18.060
They were doing a good job at doing what they were asked to do.

46:18.060 --> 46:22.260
I just wish that Square had taken a different approach to how they announced and unveiled

46:22.260 --> 46:23.260
that.

46:23.260 --> 46:26.380
SSG 100 Matt suggests Danny DeVito as Hulk.

46:26.380 --> 46:27.380
Danny DeVito is everything.

46:27.380 --> 46:28.380
Come on.

46:28.380 --> 46:29.380
Come on.

46:29.380 --> 46:30.380
Yes.

46:30.380 --> 46:31.380
All right.

46:31.380 --> 46:32.380
What else is Square Enix?

46:32.380 --> 46:33.380
That was it.

46:33.380 --> 46:34.380
That was it.

46:34.380 --> 46:35.380
All right.

46:35.380 --> 46:36.380
Well, then let's move on.

46:37.060 --> 46:38.060
What did Ubisoft talk about?

46:38.060 --> 46:41.180
I didn't watch this whole thing because there's a lot of the games I just really don't care

46:41.180 --> 46:42.180
about.

46:42.180 --> 46:43.900
But I didn't see any of it because I was working.

46:43.900 --> 46:46.980
So I did check out a bit of it.

46:46.980 --> 46:50.100
So I watched the Watchdog Legion stuff, which looks pretty neat.

46:50.100 --> 46:54.220
So that the kind of the hook with Watchdog Legion, it's going to take place in London

46:54.220 --> 46:59.660
and you can recruit a bunch of different characters, pretty much anybody in the world.

46:59.660 --> 47:04.660
So you'll be able to, you know, they were showing this grandma who is like an assassin

47:04.700 --> 47:09.740
type person and a bunch of other, you know, hacker types that you could get.

47:09.740 --> 47:13.700
And, you know, one guy might be, you know, an expert at drones or something.

47:13.700 --> 47:18.420
And so you you do research on them and then you can recruit them in or they can get killed.

47:18.420 --> 47:23.620
And it's it's really neat that you have like this big crew that you kind of work together

47:23.620 --> 47:27.100
on taking back London.

47:27.100 --> 47:28.540
So that's coming out March.

47:28.540 --> 47:33.940
I did like that they're kind of like evolving the series as opposed to like the same old

47:34.020 --> 47:36.660
type of formula in a new city or something like that.

47:36.660 --> 47:39.660
Yeah, I like that. They're like, well, how can we make this a little different?

47:39.660 --> 47:43.500
Oh, hack the planet. Literally, you know, that would be something different.

47:43.500 --> 47:45.740
Yeah, it looks like it does look interesting.

47:45.740 --> 47:47.940
So I do want to play it.

47:47.940 --> 47:49.980
Hopefully I will finish this one.

47:49.980 --> 47:51.340
I haven't played the first one.

47:51.340 --> 47:56.700
I have it and I haven't finished the second one.

47:56.700 --> 47:59.460
Ubisoft will honestly probably give the first one away.

47:59.460 --> 48:03.380
Maybe even the second one when this one's about to come out just to try to build.

48:03.380 --> 48:06.020
Yeah, probably PlayStation Plus is that a lot.

48:06.020 --> 48:07.860
But I've yeah, I've still got this somewhere.

48:07.860 --> 48:09.300
I've like not played it at all.

48:09.300 --> 48:11.300
But the second one's a great game.

48:11.300 --> 48:13.140
So I will have to get around to it.

48:13.140 --> 48:17.060
Nifty 805 says, can I take back London as Kylie Minow?

48:17.060 --> 48:22.260
Hey, maybe, maybe, you know, they can't use the Spice Girls, but I bet you they could

48:22.260 --> 48:28.300
have a pop superstar group that you could possess and take over with your dance moves.

48:28.300 --> 48:30.300
Let's put another girl through her paces.

48:30.300 --> 48:35.940
Yeah, that sounds pretty wrong when you say it like that.

48:35.940 --> 48:38.260
That's quoting something like Spice World.

48:38.260 --> 48:44.100
It's like that's like something a pimp would say, you know, anyway.

48:44.100 --> 48:50.020
So because everybody has to have their own service subscription service, Ubisoft has

48:50.020 --> 48:58.520
you play plus, which you can subscribe to for about 15 dollars a month.

48:58.520 --> 49:00.800
And it's going to be a PC only service.

49:00.800 --> 49:06.480
And they're going to have, I guess, early access that's going to free access before

49:06.480 --> 49:11.280
if you sign up before August 15th, you'll get free access from the 3rd of September

49:11.280 --> 49:13.820
to the end of September.

49:13.820 --> 49:21.120
And then they have access to over 100 PC games early and beta access to new launch titles.

49:21.120 --> 49:25.840
And also with DLC and expansions being included with that, too.

49:25.840 --> 49:27.640
Well, there's room for everybody.

49:27.640 --> 49:33.400
How about we just say that that was kind of how I felt and I'm worried because when

49:33.400 --> 49:40.280
it comes to the the game subscription service thing, everybody wants to do their version

49:40.280 --> 49:44.580
of it now because they saw what happened with movies, how Netflix and somewhat Hulu really

49:44.580 --> 49:46.700
got to dominate the conversation early on.

49:46.700 --> 49:51.760
And now everybody likes CBS, like even Disney Plus, to an extent, has to catch up, although

49:51.760 --> 49:54.320
we all know Disney Plus is not going to have a problem catching up.

49:54.320 --> 49:58.160
But, you know, we have to see all these other now didn't see an answer going to do their

49:58.160 --> 49:59.160
own thing now, too.

49:59.160 --> 50:00.160
I don't know.

50:00.160 --> 50:01.160
But but this is only PC.

50:01.160 --> 50:06.120
So I'm kind of fine with that because Ubisoft games are part of like the Xbox Game Pass

50:06.120 --> 50:07.120
stuff.

50:07.120 --> 50:09.580
So it's kind of OK.

50:09.580 --> 50:15.080
Then they've got Rainbow Six Quarantine, which is going to be a new co-op game with zombies.

50:15.080 --> 50:16.080
Hooray.

50:16.080 --> 50:19.740
That's coming out in 2020.

50:19.740 --> 50:24.560
They showed off some stuff for Assassin's Creed Odyssey, this new mode called Story

50:24.560 --> 50:31.340
Creator Mode, which allow you to create your own quests and share them with other players.

50:31.340 --> 50:32.340
So neat.

50:32.340 --> 50:35.620
That's a way to kind of get more life out of the game when they're not doing another

50:35.620 --> 50:36.700
Assassin's Creed this year.

50:36.700 --> 50:39.960
They're taking the year off, which is OK, honestly.

50:39.960 --> 50:42.740
It's OK to not do one every single year.

50:42.740 --> 50:45.920
They showed off a Ghost Recon Breakpoint.

50:45.920 --> 50:50.480
So that's going to have a new beta that's going to be along with the game win pre-orders

50:50.480 --> 50:53.520
and they're going to kick off in those games or money.

50:53.520 --> 50:54.520
Yep.

50:54.520 --> 50:56.520
September 5th.

50:56.520 --> 51:04.820
And then apparently there's going to be Tom Clancy's elite squad, which is a mobile game.

51:04.820 --> 51:08.760
They're doing a Division movie on Netflix.

51:08.760 --> 51:12.660
And then this is something that's kind of interesting, Roller Champions, which is a

51:12.660 --> 51:17.660
brand new free to play multiplayer game.

51:17.660 --> 51:23.100
It's a kind of roller derby or like a cross between rugby and roller derby.

51:23.100 --> 51:24.540
Yeah, it looked pretty cool.

51:24.540 --> 51:29.360
I'll give a quick shout out actually to one of our listeners, Dark Tetsuya, who actually

51:29.360 --> 51:33.340
had submitted a YouTube of him playing this for a potential midpoint break for tonight's

51:33.340 --> 51:34.340
show.

51:34.340 --> 51:38.240
One of the reasons I couldn't use it was because it has a lot of copyright music in it.

51:38.240 --> 51:41.420
And I was worried it was a little loud in his video and I was like, we might get Twitch

51:41.420 --> 51:45.940
muted if I use this, but I think he put it up on YouTube and Dark Tetsuya, you can feel

51:45.940 --> 51:49.420
free to link it here now, but you should check out his gameplay video if you're curious for

51:49.420 --> 51:50.420
more on that.

51:50.420 --> 51:51.980
Cause I'm kind of curious to check this out.

51:51.980 --> 51:54.660
I like the roller blade type of games.

51:54.660 --> 52:00.020
And then other gaming stuff, they also had Gods and Monsters, which kind of looks like

52:00.020 --> 52:04.540
it's like a Zelda type game, but with Greek mythology.

52:04.540 --> 52:06.540
And so that's kind of neat.

52:06.540 --> 52:08.780
Yeah, that looked cool.

52:08.780 --> 52:13.100
They also had a new mode and customization for For Honor.

52:13.100 --> 52:17.340
So it's this mode called Soul Rush.

52:17.340 --> 52:25.820
And they also shot off yet another TV series, Mythic Quest Ravens Banquet, which is being

52:25.820 --> 52:30.060
done by the folks behind It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia.

52:30.060 --> 52:38.740
So it's about, I don't know if he's going to be in it, but, how was it, Rob McElney

52:38.780 --> 52:44.900
He basically, him, Charlie Day, and they say Megan Ganz.

52:44.900 --> 52:47.960
So I know him and Charlie Day are in It's Always Sunny.

52:47.960 --> 52:53.780
It's supposed to be about a game development studio and just kind of the stuff that goes

52:53.780 --> 52:54.780
on there.

52:54.780 --> 52:58.700
And so basically he plays this guy named Grim.

52:58.700 --> 53:02.500
Can you imagine, and it's always, oh my God, this actually, now I'm like more hyped about

53:02.500 --> 53:03.500
this than when I first heard it.

53:03.500 --> 53:08.020
So here's the thing though, it's only on Apple's TV plus service or whatever they've got.

53:08.020 --> 53:10.260
They're like stupid subscription service.

53:10.260 --> 53:12.740
Just well, just like I'm going to probably get it.

53:12.740 --> 53:16.140
Just like I said, everybody's got their own subscription service now and it's making it

53:16.140 --> 53:17.860
difficult as a consumer.

53:17.860 --> 53:20.120
Well, that isn't just an Apple problem.

53:20.120 --> 53:21.260
It's an NBC problem.

53:21.260 --> 53:23.460
It's a CBS all access problem.

53:23.460 --> 53:27.780
It's everybody wants a piece of the pie and of course, doing it because it is another

53:27.780 --> 53:28.780
year.

53:28.780 --> 53:34.100
So you have another year of Just Dance, Just Dance 2020 also coming to the Wii.

53:34.100 --> 53:37.180
I think people made way too big of a deal out of the fact that it's still coming out

53:37.180 --> 53:38.180
to the Wii.

53:38.180 --> 53:39.180
Who cares?

53:39.180 --> 53:40.180
Let's be real.

53:40.180 --> 53:41.180
It's not that complicated.

53:41.180 --> 53:44.140
And everybody, by the way, did you notice how people were saying, oh, I guess none for

53:44.140 --> 53:45.820
the Wii U, huh?

53:45.820 --> 53:49.180
The Wii U plays Wii games by releasing it for the Wii.

53:49.180 --> 53:53.800
They are in fact releasing it for the Wii U, food for thought, but it doesn't matter.

53:53.800 --> 53:57.100
You guys said, you guys that are going to the extent to listen to a podcast about video

53:57.100 --> 53:59.380
games, we're never going to buy this game on the Wii anyway.

53:59.380 --> 54:00.380
You're buying it on whatever.

54:00.380 --> 54:04.900
Well, I shouldn't say that maybe, but you're going to buy it on whatever other current

54:04.900 --> 54:07.260
platform you're gaming on or PC probably.

54:07.260 --> 54:08.340
Or Stadia.

54:08.340 --> 54:14.060
The Wii is for those multitude of retirement homes and community centers that still use

54:14.060 --> 54:16.700
these games a lot to get people up and moving.

54:16.700 --> 54:21.340
Like don't underestimate the casuals when it comes to Just Dance.

54:21.340 --> 54:24.340
Don't underestimate the power of the casuals.

54:24.340 --> 54:25.340
That's right.

54:25.340 --> 54:26.700
Don't underestimate the power of the casual.

54:26.700 --> 54:28.820
So that's it.

54:28.820 --> 54:32.500
You didn't mention, somebody in chat mentioned it, but when you talked about like shows,

54:32.500 --> 54:34.180
you didn't mention the Division movie.

54:34.180 --> 54:35.180
I did mention it.

54:35.180 --> 54:36.180
That was, I mentioned that first.

54:36.180 --> 54:37.180
Oh, I guess I just blacked out.

54:37.180 --> 54:38.180
Yes.

54:38.180 --> 54:39.180
They're getting a movie.

54:39.180 --> 54:40.180
My bad.

54:40.180 --> 54:41.180
Yeah.

54:41.180 --> 54:42.180
Coming to Netflix.

54:42.180 --> 54:43.180
Okay.

54:43.180 --> 54:44.180
All right.

54:44.180 --> 54:45.180
So yes, there's, and what?

54:45.180 --> 54:46.180
Jake Gyllenhaal and who was in it?

54:46.180 --> 54:48.620
The redhead, Jessica Chastain, right?

54:48.620 --> 54:54.500
I don't know, but that sounds interesting more so than the TV show, but I do want to

54:54.500 --> 54:57.220
see the TV show because I like It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia.

54:57.220 --> 54:59.220
Ooh, great.

54:59.220 --> 55:03.580
Comment on Just Dance by Questbuster in our chat room saying the Wii is also used in a

55:03.580 --> 55:07.460
hospitals as a rehab option for some patients like kids.

55:07.460 --> 55:11.740
Well, that, that'll make you feel like garbage for making fun of the fact that game's coming

55:11.740 --> 55:12.740
out for the Wii.

55:12.740 --> 55:13.740
Yeah.

55:13.740 --> 55:14.740
You're making fun of sick kids now.

55:14.740 --> 55:15.740
Yeah.

55:15.740 --> 55:16.740
Piece of trash.

55:16.740 --> 55:17.740
Think twice before you tweet.

55:17.740 --> 55:18.740
Anyway.

55:18.740 --> 55:19.740
No, but in all seriousness.

55:19.740 --> 55:23.980
I mean, aren't the kids sick enough and you're now you're making them played like a decade

55:23.980 --> 55:24.980
old console.

55:24.980 --> 55:25.980
I mean, come on.

55:25.980 --> 55:30.440
In all seriousness, it is very cool that, you know, if they're able to put the game

55:30.440 --> 55:35.040
on the Wii, hey, they're still supporting it because there is situations like that.

55:35.040 --> 55:40.320
And maybe they're not the majority of cases, but you know, it's, they wouldn't put it on

55:40.320 --> 55:42.160
that console if it wasn't selling.

55:42.160 --> 55:43.160
Exactly.

55:43.160 --> 55:44.160
Exactly that.

55:44.160 --> 55:48.800
So, and mistake theory also points out it's also still carried in libraries.

55:48.800 --> 55:52.560
A lot of libraries still only have Wii games and no other consoles.

55:52.560 --> 55:57.040
I don't know if this joke is wrong or not, but I, I, I love a good pun.

55:57.040 --> 55:59.280
So Sia Tabiri says, we have.

55:59.280 --> 56:00.280
Why not?

56:00.280 --> 56:01.280
Why not?

56:01.280 --> 56:02.280
That's what works for me.

56:02.280 --> 56:03.280
That works for me.

56:03.280 --> 56:04.280
I love a good pun.

56:04.280 --> 56:05.280
Why not?

56:05.280 --> 56:09.280
I love a good pun when I was saying them the other week.

56:09.280 --> 56:11.280
Well, cause yours aren't good.

56:11.280 --> 56:12.280
All right.

56:12.280 --> 56:13.280
Moving on.

56:13.280 --> 56:15.200
Uh, your favorite event, every E3, right?

56:15.200 --> 56:16.600
Loki, the PC gaming show.

56:16.600 --> 56:17.600
Oh yes.

56:17.600 --> 56:18.920
It's so, so amazing.

56:18.920 --> 56:24.360
I don't really give a shit, but, um, we can just really quickly go over some of the stuff

56:24.360 --> 56:25.360
that they did talk about.

56:25.800 --> 56:30.160
Uh, some of the titles that they showed off, age of wonders, planet fall.

56:30.160 --> 56:33.400
Uh, I don't know what the hell that's about.

56:33.400 --> 56:37.000
Auto chess has nothing to do with cars.

56:37.000 --> 56:40.240
Maybe instead they, they, they announced a lot of games.

56:40.240 --> 56:42.760
Maybe we just want to touch on some of the highlights.

56:42.760 --> 56:43.760
I am.

56:43.760 --> 56:44.760
Chivalry 2.

56:44.760 --> 56:45.760
That's pretty cool.

56:45.760 --> 56:46.760
Yeah.

56:46.760 --> 56:47.760
Chivalry is a pretty good game.

56:47.760 --> 56:54.520
Uh, Chris Tails looks interesting.

56:54.520 --> 56:59.600
This is supposed to kind of go along like a big time travel aspect.

56:59.600 --> 57:00.600
So that looks interesting.

57:00.600 --> 57:01.600
Yeah.

57:01.600 --> 57:04.280
These, these time travel and time loop types of games are all the rage.

57:04.280 --> 57:09.080
I know you weren't here last week and I doubt you watched the Microsoft thing very carefully,

57:09.080 --> 57:13.920
but there was a really cool looking narrative game by Annapurna, um, that I was a big fan

57:13.920 --> 57:15.780
of called 12 minutes.

57:15.780 --> 57:19.400
That's about like a time loop type of situation and it looked, I would, I would really urge

57:19.400 --> 57:22.640
you to look at the trailer for that game cause it looked really cool and I think you'd be

57:22.640 --> 57:23.640
into it.

57:23.760 --> 57:27.160
I, it's probably a multi-platform, probably not just Microsoft.

57:27.160 --> 57:28.160
Yeah.

57:28.160 --> 57:30.440
Um, they showed off more footage for Last Oasis.

57:30.440 --> 57:36.920
That's the one about, um, I remember it's something that has to do with like a plan

57:36.920 --> 57:42.220
of being un, um, you can't inhabit it because it's just basically too hot.

57:42.220 --> 57:47.680
And so there's only this strip down the middle that basically they can survive on and they've

57:47.680 --> 57:49.400
got these rolling wood machines and stuff.

57:49.400 --> 57:50.400
It looks pretty awesome.

57:50.400 --> 57:52.760
So that's, that's something they showed off.

57:52.920 --> 57:55.560
Um, Midnight Ghost Hunt.

57:55.560 --> 57:56.920
That one looks pretty cool.

57:56.920 --> 57:59.520
And so basically you have to hunt ghosts.

57:59.520 --> 58:00.520
You don't say?

58:00.520 --> 58:01.520
Yes.

58:01.520 --> 58:05.360
Um, but I remember correctly, there was one I saw, I don't know if it's the same, maybe

58:05.360 --> 58:08.480
it was a different, uh, indie game that was ghost hunting, but there was one I saw that

58:08.480 --> 58:12.400
was like four against one and you get the, as the ghost, you actually get the possess

58:12.400 --> 58:15.440
object and throw them at other players and knock them down and stuff.

58:15.440 --> 58:17.880
It's kind of like prop hunt, but a little different.

58:17.880 --> 58:21.640
Um, Hey, real quick question from Frodo Swagons in our chat and maybe, maybe you have the

58:21.640 --> 58:22.640
answer to this Loki.

58:22.680 --> 58:25.760
So, but can someone explain to me what that auto chess game is?

58:25.760 --> 58:28.680
I keep seeing advertisements for it everywhere, but I don't see any good feedback and I must

58:28.680 --> 58:31.680
admit I'm not up and up on the auto chess myself.

58:31.680 --> 58:34.280
Did you, did you catch a little more on what that's all about?

58:34.280 --> 58:35.880
No, no idea.

58:35.880 --> 58:40.480
It's a, they said it's a part of one of the Epic store games that they're going to have.

58:40.480 --> 58:48.560
And it's, um, I mean, honestly it looks like just this really fancy chess game.

58:48.560 --> 58:53.280
I guess it looks like it's, I don't know, like battle chess.

58:53.280 --> 58:54.280
Okay.

58:54.280 --> 58:57.280
So I'm looking up some more info online just so we can get familiar with it.

58:57.280 --> 59:00.440
And, and where, where sometimes the hosts fail, the listeners are there to save the

59:00.440 --> 59:01.440
day as well.

59:01.440 --> 59:04.640
And I'll get some, you have to understand that, you know, your question is outweighing

59:04.640 --> 59:06.080
my interest in the games.

59:06.080 --> 59:07.360
Well, here's what it's all about.

59:07.360 --> 59:12.680
So there's a mod for Dota called Dota auto chess, and you can do eight players that play

59:12.680 --> 59:18.240
a modified version of chess, but it uses characters and gameplay elements from Dota two.

59:18.240 --> 59:21.600
And apparently this is really popular in Dota, which is probably why I missed it.

59:21.600 --> 59:25.840
Cause I've played probably like 95% heroes of the storm, 5% league of legends.

59:25.840 --> 59:28.560
I just don't really play any Dota anymore.

59:28.560 --> 59:30.280
But maybe I should be, I don't know.

59:30.280 --> 59:35.360
But apparently now this is so, so, and this is really funny because Dota exists, Dota

59:35.360 --> 59:38.880
two exists because it was Warcraft three mod spun off.

59:38.880 --> 59:39.880
Now we have Dota.

59:39.880 --> 59:42.360
So now this auto chess mod is so popular.

59:42.360 --> 59:44.680
It's spinning off into its own game, auto chess.

59:44.680 --> 59:46.020
That's what's happening here.

59:46.020 --> 59:51.100
So, uh, and then, uh, our listeners here, quest buster says, uh, one note on auto chess.

59:51.100 --> 59:54.780
Apparently it's also responsible for pushing valve to make Dota underlords and riot games

59:54.780 --> 59:56.620
do the same auto chess light game.

59:56.620 --> 59:58.380
I had no idea what it was either.

59:58.380 --> 59:59.580
It sounds like a MOBA.

59:59.580 --> 01:00:02.960
You create teams from a pool of characters, then set them to auto battle.

01:00:02.960 --> 01:00:05.800
But unlike a MOBA, you don't control everything during a fight.

01:00:05.800 --> 01:00:10.340
You pretty much just let the teams go at it and hope your strategic picks win the day.

01:00:10.340 --> 01:00:11.940
Interesting.

01:00:11.940 --> 01:00:15.980
So it's like tabs, but with Dota characters.

01:00:16.020 --> 01:00:19.900
Well, here's the thing, if you want to know more about it, Dota two is a free game.

01:00:19.900 --> 01:00:23.140
You know, they make their money off selling the heroes and that other stuff.

01:00:23.140 --> 01:00:25.180
So, um, go check it out.

01:00:25.180 --> 01:00:29.800
You have the ability to check out this mod and, uh, it'll, it'll help planet zoo.

01:00:29.800 --> 01:00:33.540
It's a new game from the folks that did planet coaster, except now you're creating a zoo.

01:00:33.540 --> 01:00:34.540
Oh yeah.

01:00:34.540 --> 01:00:35.540
That look cute.

01:00:35.540 --> 01:00:40.980
Why can't you just create both in one, you know, like a Marine world or animal kingdom

01:00:40.980 --> 01:00:45.180
hippopotamus on a roller coaster, it's like have animals over here and your roller coasters

01:00:45.180 --> 01:00:46.180
have it both.

01:00:46.180 --> 01:00:50.980
You know, I guess we can't mix games, you know, I did see the zoo game that looked pretty

01:00:50.980 --> 01:00:51.980
awesome.

01:00:51.980 --> 01:00:58.940
Uh, Shenmue three, this game, I telling Liza looks kind of back it up, back it up.

01:00:58.940 --> 01:01:02.780
You what you, you zip past the Shenmue three thing, like the biggest thing that everybody's

01:01:02.780 --> 01:01:04.780
talking about from this conference was the Shenmue three thing.

01:01:04.780 --> 01:01:07.340
Do you know what she said about Shenmue three?

01:01:07.340 --> 01:01:11.660
What they say about it is going to be exclusive to the Epic game store for 12 months.

01:01:11.660 --> 01:01:12.660
That's right.

01:01:12.660 --> 01:01:17.440
So even if you did a Kickstarter backing for the game, well, that'll teach you with the

01:01:17.440 --> 01:01:21.360
understanding that you would be getting a steam copy as they were advertising on Kickstarter

01:01:21.360 --> 01:01:25.620
at the time, you're going to be getting it for the Epic store instead.

01:01:25.620 --> 01:01:26.620
Lucky you.

01:01:26.620 --> 01:01:27.620
Yeah.

01:01:27.620 --> 01:01:28.820
So this has a lot of people not happy.

01:01:28.820 --> 01:01:32.860
I wonder if it's going to escalate to a point, uh, with Kickstarter.

01:01:32.860 --> 01:01:33.860
I don't know.

01:01:33.860 --> 01:01:35.300
It's it's see, here's the thing.

01:01:35.300 --> 01:01:41.420
I don't have as much of a like resistance against the Epic store.

01:01:41.420 --> 01:01:43.780
I use Epic and I use steam.

01:01:43.780 --> 01:01:45.540
I use a few others too.

01:01:45.540 --> 01:01:50.440
Um, so for me, I'm not so bothered, but I also understand that if a person doesn't want

01:01:50.440 --> 01:01:52.740
to have an Epic account, they have every right not to have one.

01:01:52.740 --> 01:01:53.920
Actually, I should say this.

01:01:53.920 --> 01:01:54.920
You know what?

01:01:54.920 --> 01:01:55.920
I will say this.

01:01:55.920 --> 01:01:57.660
I believe my Epic account was hacked.

01:01:57.660 --> 01:02:01.860
Um, I'm getting all these friend requests from people I don't fricking know.

01:02:01.860 --> 01:02:06.460
And they connected my PlayStation or they connected the account to a PlayStation account.

01:02:06.460 --> 01:02:07.900
I'd never heard of.

01:02:07.900 --> 01:02:09.180
And so I had to unconnect it.

01:02:09.180 --> 01:02:12.580
And now the fricking Epic store won't let me reconnect it with my right account.

01:02:12.580 --> 01:02:16.140
In fact, I should check on my ticket because I sent a help ticket to try to get that fixed.

01:02:16.140 --> 01:02:19.500
But I was like, did somebody get into my Epic account?

01:02:19.500 --> 01:02:23.820
Because I may have used the same password I use somewhere else and the other, you know

01:02:23.820 --> 01:02:27.500
how that happens when one of those sites gets hacked and all the, the, they try to use those

01:02:27.500 --> 01:02:31.260
username passwords other places, and it probably works for somebody on my Epic store thing.

01:02:31.260 --> 01:02:35.100
I have since changed the password on Epic store and I believe if they have to factor

01:02:35.100 --> 01:02:36.940
off, I turned it on as well, which I think they do.

01:02:36.940 --> 01:02:37.940
So I turned that on.

01:02:38.180 --> 01:02:41.460
Really, like I've just been trying to turn on two factor off, like everywhere I can.

01:02:42.260 --> 01:02:46.660
Because I get emails all the time, all the time on my Microsoft account.

01:02:47.380 --> 01:02:50.340
Someone keeps trying to get into my fricking Microsoft account.

01:02:50.340 --> 01:02:52.180
Thank God I have two factor off.

01:02:52.180 --> 01:02:52.820
Anyway.

01:02:52.820 --> 01:02:54.660
So anyway, uh, sorry tangent.

01:02:54.660 --> 01:02:57.860
But, um, it just goes to show that like, you know, if somebody doesn't want to have an

01:02:57.860 --> 01:03:00.820
Epic store account, I can't say I blame them at this juncture.

01:03:02.340 --> 01:03:04.500
Uh, Terraria's Journey's End.

01:03:04.500 --> 01:03:05.700
It's a brand new expansion.

01:03:05.700 --> 01:03:07.780
They said that has a ton of content in it.

01:03:07.780 --> 01:03:10.580
So that looks, I'm, I was unaware.

01:03:10.580 --> 01:03:12.900
They're still at, you know, adding expansions to that.

01:03:12.900 --> 01:03:13.700
So that's pretty cool.

01:03:14.740 --> 01:03:20.340
Um, Valfaris looks pretty cool.

01:03:20.340 --> 01:03:22.660
It's a run and gun game similar to Contra.

01:03:23.460 --> 01:03:26.420
And then of course, uh, Vampire the Masquerade Bloodlines 2.

01:03:26.420 --> 01:03:27.700
They showed another trailer for that.

01:03:27.700 --> 01:03:28.900
It looked interesting.

01:03:28.900 --> 01:03:31.620
It looks pretty good actually, but I didn't like first person.

01:03:32.500 --> 01:03:35.220
If they give you like a character view, I would be down for it.

01:03:36.100 --> 01:03:38.580
Uh, they have an expansion for Warframe coming out.

01:03:38.580 --> 01:03:45.860
Uh, I think it's Emprene and let's see what else.

01:03:45.860 --> 01:03:47.780
Zombie Army for Dead War.

01:03:48.660 --> 01:03:51.860
That sounds very generic and has zombies.

01:03:52.900 --> 01:03:54.260
It looks like they have Zombie Hitler.

01:03:55.140 --> 01:03:55.780
Of course they do.

01:03:56.900 --> 01:04:00.340
Just a quick, I was, I was looking at my phone cause I wanted to see if Epic had responded

01:04:00.340 --> 01:04:03.220
to the ticket I sent them and no response yet, but to be fair, it's the weekend.

01:04:03.220 --> 01:04:04.980
So we'll give them, we'll see what happens tomorrow.

01:04:05.940 --> 01:04:07.060
So that's all.

01:04:07.060 --> 01:04:07.620
All right.

01:04:07.620 --> 01:04:08.900
So the PC gaming show.

01:04:08.900 --> 01:04:14.820
No, probably the only big like thud was the whole Shenmue 3 thing, but I don't know if

01:04:14.820 --> 01:04:16.260
there was a lot of like what had people...

01:04:16.260 --> 01:04:21.460
There was another game just recently that was a Kickstarter that, that was also an issue too.

01:04:22.180 --> 01:04:24.820
I don't remember which game, what it was now, but there was another one.

01:04:24.820 --> 01:04:26.260
It was also a Kickstarter game.

01:04:26.260 --> 01:04:27.220
It wasn't Bloodstained.

01:04:27.220 --> 01:04:28.180
It wasn't Bloodstained.

01:04:28.180 --> 01:04:31.860
It was, um, it may have been a smaller title.

01:04:31.860 --> 01:04:35.540
I don't remember, but I know we just talked about something very similar.

01:04:36.500 --> 01:04:41.620
And it's just it, I understand it's the allure of getting more money, you know, for, you

01:04:41.620 --> 01:04:47.140
have a larger margin there, but, um, the same time, you know, maybe you pick that for your

01:04:47.140 --> 01:04:48.580
next game and not this one.

01:04:48.580 --> 01:04:53.620
I don't know, but maybe it shouldn't back.

01:04:54.820 --> 01:05:01.140
You know, it's it, no, it is making the desire to back Kickstarters harder and harder.

01:05:01.140 --> 01:05:06.820
And I don't know if some of these companies realize how much they're like shitting in

01:05:06.820 --> 01:05:09.780
the tank to screw it up for everybody else.

01:05:09.780 --> 01:05:10.420
You know what I mean?

01:05:10.980 --> 01:05:12.820
Like just, it's unfortunate.

01:05:12.820 --> 01:05:13.700
It's really unfortunate.

01:05:14.900 --> 01:05:15.380
All right.

01:05:15.380 --> 01:05:15.940
All right.

01:05:15.940 --> 01:05:17.380
So that's it for the PC gaming event.

01:05:17.380 --> 01:05:23.140
So, um, now I did not realize Konami was doing a thing this year because I remember the year

01:05:23.140 --> 01:05:26.100
that Konami had that clusterfuck of a press conference.

01:05:26.100 --> 01:05:26.900
Oh yes.

01:05:26.900 --> 01:05:28.580
That just all the lols.

01:05:28.580 --> 01:05:31.540
That was the year they announced 99 nights too.

01:05:31.540 --> 01:05:34.180
And the guy was like, applause, applause.

01:05:34.820 --> 01:05:36.260
Nobody was applauding.

01:05:36.260 --> 01:05:36.820
It's great.

01:05:36.820 --> 01:05:38.180
Go look it up on YouTube.

01:05:38.180 --> 01:05:39.620
What year was that?

01:05:39.620 --> 01:05:40.900
We were at E3 that year.

01:05:40.900 --> 01:05:43.140
We just, that was a rock revolution year too.

01:05:43.780 --> 01:05:47.940
Uh, I thought that was the year they showed off, uh, dance, the dance connect.

01:05:47.940 --> 01:05:48.180
Yeah.

01:05:48.180 --> 01:05:52.180
Dance evolution and, uh, rock revolution were coming out the same year.

01:05:52.180 --> 01:05:52.500
God.

01:05:52.500 --> 01:05:53.300
What year was that?

01:05:53.860 --> 01:05:55.540
2010 says orange, right?

01:05:55.540 --> 01:05:55.940
Seriously.

01:05:55.940 --> 01:05:58.500
Y'all go look up the YouTube Konami press conference 2010.

01:06:00.100 --> 01:06:00.740
Oh my God.

01:06:00.740 --> 01:06:02.100
The lols anyway.

01:06:02.100 --> 01:06:04.500
Uh, but Konami did something a lot different this year.

01:06:04.500 --> 01:06:05.300
It wasn't funny.

01:06:05.300 --> 01:06:06.900
It was just one big announcement, right?

01:06:07.700 --> 01:06:08.020
Yeah.

01:06:08.020 --> 01:06:16.100
So they talked, um, since they, they own, um, you know, Hudson soft, um, they basically

01:06:16.100 --> 01:06:22.500
announced that a turbo graphics 16 mini, uh, PC engine core graphics mini and PC engine

01:06:22.500 --> 01:06:24.580
mini were going to be coming out.

01:06:24.580 --> 01:06:25.460
I'm getting them both.

01:06:26.260 --> 01:06:28.980
And so of course those are the three different consoles.

01:06:28.980 --> 01:06:30.340
We're in a different region.

01:06:30.340 --> 01:06:30.820
Hold up.

01:06:30.820 --> 01:06:34.260
I'm surprised to hear this from you dark soccer, because usually you're the type that

01:06:34.260 --> 01:06:36.260
says, ah, I already own it.

01:06:37.060 --> 01:06:38.340
Well, I do.

01:06:38.340 --> 01:06:44.820
However, um, each of them come with different games and they're, I don't think I have

01:06:44.820 --> 01:06:51.940
superstar soldier and I would like to play a version of, uh, uh, Jacula X, um, where

01:06:51.940 --> 01:06:53.620
I don't have to use my desk.

01:06:54.500 --> 01:06:55.620
You know, keep it preserved.

01:06:55.620 --> 01:06:57.220
And I've been like, ah, it's not worth it.

01:06:57.220 --> 01:06:57.780
It's not worth it.

01:06:57.780 --> 01:06:58.740
It's not worth it.

01:06:58.740 --> 01:07:02.500
But the additional superstar soldier is kind of a big one for me.

01:07:02.500 --> 01:07:07.300
And we are going to get the, um, the turbo graphics mini because it's got some good

01:07:07.300 --> 01:07:07.700
stuff on it.

01:07:07.700 --> 01:07:10.500
I mean, East book one and two, we've got the CDs for those.

01:07:10.500 --> 01:07:18.340
I mean, we're talking about, um, uh, uh, we've talked about CD games on these two.

01:07:18.900 --> 01:07:23.860
Um, and also I'd like to play our type without, cause our type for a PC engine is really

01:07:23.860 --> 01:07:24.180
good.

01:07:24.180 --> 01:07:27.460
I was tired of switching out hue cards cause they were too hue cards.

01:07:27.460 --> 01:07:29.380
So it'd be nice to have it all as one game.

01:07:29.380 --> 01:07:34.100
Like, and I think it's going to be like the, the, uh, CD version because the CD version

01:07:34.100 --> 01:07:34.740
was one.

01:07:34.740 --> 01:07:39.540
So, so they've got basically your usual features that we go to the mini console.

01:07:39.540 --> 01:07:43.620
So quick saving, they've got the different display modes, emulates CRT TVs and stuff

01:07:43.620 --> 01:07:44.340
like that.

01:07:44.580 --> 01:07:47.460
What's kind of neat is they're going to have a multi-tap, um, support.

01:07:47.460 --> 01:07:50.260
So you can, it will support up to five players.

01:07:50.260 --> 01:07:54.820
Um, but you have to buy a multi-tap separately.

01:07:54.820 --> 01:08:00.020
So, um, for the North American European regions, you're gonna be getting an alien crush,

01:08:00.020 --> 01:08:05.780
dungeon explorer, new adventure Island, ninja spirit, our type ease book one and two, and

01:08:05.780 --> 01:08:07.300
more titles to be announced later.

01:08:07.300 --> 01:08:13.300
And then of course in Japan, Bonk, Castlevania, Rondo of blood, China warrior, dungeon explorer,

01:08:13.300 --> 01:08:17.700
superstar soldier, ease book one and two, and more to be announced later on.

01:08:17.700 --> 01:08:18.740
Why do they call it Castlevania?

01:08:18.740 --> 01:08:19.620
It was Dracula X.

01:08:20.980 --> 01:08:23.780
I mean, yeah, it's in the Castlevania series, but it was called Dracula X.

01:08:23.780 --> 01:08:29.940
It could also be a Liberty on the part of the reporter who's trying to get people to

01:08:29.940 --> 01:08:30.580
connect it.

01:08:30.580 --> 01:08:38.500
But I guess, uh, well to that, um, it's, I think, well, let me see.

01:08:38.500 --> 01:08:39.460
I'm just sure.

01:08:39.460 --> 01:08:43.380
Well, even the, the SNES version they released in the U S was Dracula X.

01:08:45.380 --> 01:08:46.020
That's right.

01:08:46.020 --> 01:08:46.340
You're right.

01:08:46.340 --> 01:08:48.180
There was a, I keep thinking of Castlevania five.

01:08:48.180 --> 01:08:49.460
That was a different thing.

01:08:49.460 --> 01:08:50.020
Yeah.

01:08:50.020 --> 01:08:53.700
But, uh, and honestly enough though, I mean, I'm a little disappointed to see that they're

01:08:53.700 --> 01:08:58.100
not bothering to translate it for the U S one since there's already a translation.

01:08:59.300 --> 01:09:04.100
But, and now we know that old games will be translated when the time's right.

01:09:04.100 --> 01:09:07.620
Like again, the trials of manna thing, go back to it's pretty amazing.

01:09:07.620 --> 01:09:11.780
There was the Castlevania Chronicles, so it's already translated, but there is a rondo

01:09:11.780 --> 01:09:14.500
of blood fan translation out too.

01:09:14.500 --> 01:09:20.500
So with voice acting, well, I tried to get into their website, but it sucks ass because,

01:09:20.500 --> 01:09:25.140
you know, they want you to enter your birth date and then it goes back to the same goddamn

01:09:25.140 --> 01:09:25.620
page again.

01:09:26.500 --> 01:09:27.060
Well, forget it.

01:09:28.420 --> 01:09:28.820
All right.

01:09:29.380 --> 01:09:34.820
So, um, I, it sounds like yet another mini console, but, uh, I, it sounds like there,

01:09:34.820 --> 01:09:39.220
you know, especially with the games being a little more obscure for some hard to get

01:09:39.220 --> 01:09:41.620
collectibles, we didn't get bonk over here though.

01:09:42.260 --> 01:09:42.980
This is a little weird.

01:09:43.620 --> 01:09:46.900
I mean, the, the game, I mean, I have, I have a feeling bunk because they said there's more

01:09:46.900 --> 01:09:47.460
to be announced.

01:09:47.460 --> 01:09:48.980
I think bonk is going to be among them.

01:09:48.980 --> 01:09:49.140
Yeah.

01:09:49.140 --> 01:09:54.180
They probably just haven't announced everything yet, but, um, but I mean the games that are

01:09:54.180 --> 01:09:58.260
on there, like I would expect for either one of these to eventually get like Lords of thunder

01:09:59.140 --> 01:10:00.740
because that was a big one.

01:10:00.740 --> 01:10:04.420
I don't see any, uh, Keith courage in the alpha zones, you know?

01:10:04.420 --> 01:10:07.140
Cause that was, that was the pack-in wasn't it?

01:10:07.140 --> 01:10:07.640
Yeah.

01:10:08.020 --> 01:10:10.260
Um, I don't see anything.

01:10:10.260 --> 01:10:11.620
What were some of the other big ones?

01:10:11.620 --> 01:10:15.940
I would imagine though the Japanese one to be really shooter heavy cause the PC engine

01:10:15.940 --> 01:10:22.260
was really shooter heavy, but like if it's, if it's Konami, why don't we get Gradius 2?

01:10:23.060 --> 01:10:27.300
I expect to at least see that one on the Japanese, uh, version.

01:10:27.300 --> 01:10:30.020
Cause you know, we didn't get Gradius 2 until it came out in a pack.

01:10:31.700 --> 01:10:32.180
All right.

01:10:32.180 --> 01:10:36.580
Well with that, that's pretty much the end of E3 the end.

01:10:36.580 --> 01:10:39.700
Uh, but what'd you guys think overall this year of E3?

01:10:39.700 --> 01:10:44.420
I mean, it was a kind of a weird year with Sony not being there and you know, us knowing

01:10:44.420 --> 01:10:46.580
that we have new consoles next year.

01:10:46.580 --> 01:10:49.620
I've kind of been saying it's a lame duck year, you know, when you know, it's kind of

01:10:49.620 --> 01:10:51.620
like the last year of the current iteration.

01:10:51.620 --> 01:10:53.540
I think it's still, I think it was still good.

01:10:53.540 --> 01:10:58.580
We still have, you know, remember we still have more announcements coming with a games

01:10:58.580 --> 01:11:01.300
com in like a month or so.

01:11:01.300 --> 01:11:05.300
So I mean, I'm kind of okay that Sony wasn't there.

01:11:05.300 --> 01:11:07.140
I still think there's good games that they announced.

01:11:07.140 --> 01:11:09.700
There's stuff to look forward to towards the end of the year.

01:11:09.700 --> 01:11:13.220
I'm glad it's not a million games coming out like in the fourth quarter.

01:11:13.220 --> 01:11:15.380
So now it's a million games in March.

01:11:15.380 --> 01:11:16.900
Well, it's, it's all over the place.

01:11:16.900 --> 01:11:19.060
So I mean, I'm fine with that.

01:11:19.060 --> 01:11:23.300
And March is right around, we get, you know, that's payday and tax return time.

01:11:23.300 --> 01:11:24.740
So smart.

01:11:25.540 --> 01:11:26.980
But I don't know.

01:11:26.980 --> 01:11:29.940
I just, I, I'm fine with the way it is.

01:11:29.940 --> 01:11:34.180
There wasn't anything like really shocking that came out of it.

01:11:34.180 --> 01:11:36.980
I think it's just kind of run the course.

01:11:36.980 --> 01:11:37.700
Yeah.

01:11:37.700 --> 01:11:39.860
Um, act depth and chat says it was an average year.

01:11:39.860 --> 01:11:40.580
It wasn't bad.

01:11:40.580 --> 01:11:42.420
It was quite good, but not necessarily great.

01:11:42.420 --> 01:11:42.660
Yeah.

01:11:42.660 --> 01:11:44.100
I'm kind of on the same page with that.

01:11:44.100 --> 01:11:47.300
I think there were a lot of like good games, like obviously March of next year is going

01:11:47.300 --> 01:11:49.460
to be a very, very strong month for games.

01:11:49.460 --> 01:11:51.940
Um, March is the new November, but that's okay.

01:11:51.940 --> 01:11:54.580
I mean, there's still a lot of games to get excited about.

01:11:54.580 --> 01:11:57.300
And that is really what it's all about at the end of the day.

01:11:57.300 --> 01:12:01.540
So it'd be interesting once you get to March of next year to see how well Stadia is doing.

01:12:01.540 --> 01:12:02.020
Yeah.

01:12:02.020 --> 01:12:02.500
Yeah.

01:12:02.500 --> 01:12:07.860
Uh, also March of next year, uh, excuse me, not March, but next E3, uh, in television

01:12:07.860 --> 01:12:10.740
is anticipated to give a full stage conference.

01:12:10.740 --> 01:12:12.660
Now, what did you think of the colors that they had?

01:12:14.020 --> 01:12:15.060
Kind of bad-ass.

01:12:15.060 --> 01:12:17.540
Like I, the one that looks like Tron is really cool.

01:12:17.540 --> 01:12:20.740
The woodgrain one, like they're, they're very different, unique.

01:12:20.740 --> 01:12:24.420
Like if that's what they really look like, like there's that part of me that just has

01:12:24.420 --> 01:12:27.780
that reservation of, is it really going to be that good?

01:12:27.780 --> 01:12:30.820
Like, or is it a lot of talk, you know?

01:12:30.820 --> 01:12:33.060
So I just let's see the games.

01:12:33.620 --> 01:12:35.220
Let's see it IRL.

01:12:35.220 --> 01:12:37.060
I, but I'm cautiously optimistic.

01:12:37.060 --> 01:12:38.100
I think is a good way to put it.

01:12:38.100 --> 01:12:38.420
Yeah.

01:12:38.420 --> 01:12:41.620
But let's see what some of these games look like because, uh, in television never did

01:12:41.620 --> 01:12:42.660
put out publicly.

01:12:43.220 --> 01:12:46.500
Uh, I mean, I guess it was there at E3 and people were getting their hands on it, but

01:12:46.500 --> 01:12:49.460
for whatever reason, they're not putting out footage of the games yet.

01:12:49.460 --> 01:12:53.620
Although I did check their Twitter earlier and I guess that is coming in July.

01:12:53.620 --> 01:12:57.460
So they do plan to put out like another teaser that will have some of the early gameplay

01:12:57.460 --> 01:12:58.020
footage.

01:12:58.020 --> 01:13:01.540
And then next year at E3, they're going to have a full E3 press event.

01:13:01.540 --> 01:13:02.660
So that'll be interesting.

01:13:02.660 --> 01:13:08.100
I'm just kind of curious how that is going to change the dynamic potentially with the

01:13:08.100 --> 01:13:10.180
family console coming into mix.

01:13:10.180 --> 01:13:15.060
And then I hear that VCS console, the Atari one's still being redesigned again.

01:13:16.260 --> 01:13:18.660
That it's kind of going back to the drawing board.

01:13:18.660 --> 01:13:21.060
Atari needs to do something to grab my attention at this point.

01:13:21.060 --> 01:13:23.060
Cause I done forgot that that was even a thing.

01:13:23.060 --> 01:13:26.820
So it's, it's basically like a computer now, a computer box type thing.

01:13:26.820 --> 01:13:27.380
Cool.

01:13:27.380 --> 01:13:30.820
But I'm not really seeing why I need to pay attention to it right now.

01:13:30.820 --> 01:13:30.980
Yeah.

01:13:30.980 --> 01:13:32.740
That's my honest feedback for Atari.

01:13:32.740 --> 01:13:34.420
So, all right.

01:13:34.420 --> 01:13:37.780
Well, um, usually at the top of the show, it was a little bit of a special week cause

01:13:37.780 --> 01:13:41.300
we were talking about E3 and everything that happened with E3 this week, but usually at

01:13:41.300 --> 01:13:44.340
the top of the show, we like to talk about the types of video games that we've been playing

01:13:44.340 --> 01:13:44.900
this week.

01:13:44.900 --> 01:13:48.500
So let's talk about our gaming weeks and how was your gaming week and what types of

01:13:48.500 --> 01:13:50.180
video games have you been playing this week?

01:13:50.180 --> 01:13:51.860
Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?

01:13:51.860 --> 01:13:58.020
Um, it was really just, you know, the usual for me, it was, uh, um, Animal Crossing

01:13:58.020 --> 01:13:58.660
Pocket Camp.

01:13:59.380 --> 01:14:07.540
And, um, I guess trying to clean up and get everything that I can in it before, you know,

01:14:07.540 --> 01:14:08.900
I move on to something else.

01:14:09.780 --> 01:14:14.500
Um, Dan and I have been watching this Zelda marathon that's trying to raise some money

01:14:14.500 --> 01:14:15.300
for something.

01:14:15.380 --> 01:14:19.780
They have a guy with a melodica and a guy with a accordion playing during some of those

01:14:19.780 --> 01:14:21.860
and a couple of people singing is actually pretty cute.

01:14:22.420 --> 01:14:26.500
Um, but, uh, when we, when we, when I left the, actually, when I left the house this

01:14:26.500 --> 01:14:27.940
morning, they were on spirit tracks.

01:14:27.940 --> 01:14:29.940
So it gave me a chance to check out a game I hadn't played.

01:14:30.580 --> 01:14:33.700
Um, um, I'm still doing idle pouring.

01:14:33.700 --> 01:14:35.220
I know I don't mention it anymore.

01:14:35.220 --> 01:14:37.220
I'm still debating quitting it.

01:14:37.220 --> 01:14:43.540
Um, Dan and I have been working on trying to get the setup done, but we're redoing our

01:14:43.540 --> 01:14:43.860
office.

01:14:44.740 --> 01:14:48.900
So, um, there hasn't really been a whole lot going on because we've been in the middle

01:14:48.900 --> 01:14:52.900
of just reorganizing the house and then with all the pride events and everything, it's

01:14:52.900 --> 01:14:56.420
been kind of taken precedence over any other type of gaming.

01:14:56.420 --> 01:15:03.220
But I did, I did dig, uh, dig out, not ding out the, um, uh, steam link.

01:15:03.780 --> 01:15:04.820
See if we can get that hooked up.

01:15:06.180 --> 01:15:06.420
Cool.

01:15:07.060 --> 01:15:07.540
Anything else?

01:15:08.340 --> 01:15:08.820
Uh-uh.

01:15:08.820 --> 01:15:09.380
All right.

01:15:09.380 --> 01:15:10.100
We'll move on.

01:15:10.100 --> 01:15:11.140
Yeah, we'll Pokemon go.

01:15:11.940 --> 01:15:15.620
I guess a lot of people have been doing, I guess there are, uh, the shiny amount went

01:15:15.620 --> 01:15:20.340
way up over this past couple of days because of Pokemon go Fest, which sadly I wasn't,

01:15:20.340 --> 01:15:21.380
obviously none of us were there.

01:15:21.380 --> 01:15:25.700
We would probably talked about it already, but, um, I heard it was a lot of fun for those

01:15:25.700 --> 01:15:29.220
that went except, uh, Saturday, the day that got canceled.

01:15:29.220 --> 01:15:33.700
Um, because weather, but I guess, uh, the, the trade-off is that if you had a ticket

01:15:33.700 --> 01:15:39.540
for Saturday, then you next week, we'll see all of the Pokemon go Fest Pokemon on your

01:15:39.540 --> 01:15:40.980
phone, wherever you're at.

01:15:40.980 --> 01:15:45.060
So it's interesting that Niantic has that technology within the game.

01:15:45.060 --> 01:15:48.260
It's almost like they could just not even do an event in Chicago.

01:15:48.260 --> 01:15:52.340
They could just say, pay 10 bucks to attend the worldwide festival and you'll see the

01:15:52.340 --> 01:15:54.180
Pokemon wherever you're at in the world.

01:15:54.180 --> 01:15:55.540
Be kind of, I'm fine with that.

01:15:55.540 --> 01:15:55.780
Yeah.

01:15:55.780 --> 01:15:59.220
I don't know how I feel about the whole pay to win element of it, but it would be an

01:15:59.220 --> 01:16:02.580
interesting, I sit here and talk, give the money to a charity.

01:16:02.580 --> 01:16:06.580
Then it makes it, you know, actually, yes, it lessens it a lot if you do that.

01:16:06.580 --> 01:16:07.860
But anyway, I digress.

01:16:07.860 --> 01:16:08.900
Loki, how was your gaming week?

01:16:08.900 --> 01:16:09.940
I didn't play anything.

01:16:10.500 --> 01:16:11.140
Sorry.

01:16:11.140 --> 01:16:11.780
No, I did.

01:16:11.780 --> 01:16:14.100
Um, I played a little bit of Pokemon go.

01:16:14.100 --> 01:16:19.780
I found that, um, cause I had submitted a portal for a location, but it hasn't been

01:16:19.780 --> 01:16:21.540
denied or, um, accepted yet.

01:16:21.540 --> 01:16:27.540
Cause I guess it takes several months limbo, but the right down from where I had requested

01:16:27.540 --> 01:16:31.300
a portal, which I think is more of a landmark than what they picked.

01:16:31.300 --> 01:16:35.060
They picked this stupid information kiosk and put that as a portal.

01:16:35.060 --> 01:16:38.100
Now what are you going to do?

01:16:38.100 --> 01:16:39.060
Stop new.

01:16:39.060 --> 01:16:39.300
Yeah.

01:16:39.300 --> 01:16:43.540
It's, it's right across, like literally within distance of the Starbucks is there.

01:16:43.540 --> 01:16:48.420
But if they put that as one, then I think what I submitted should be good, but yeah,

01:16:48.420 --> 01:16:49.300
no way it takes time.

01:16:49.300 --> 01:16:49.700
It's fine.

01:16:50.580 --> 01:16:56.420
Starbucks is, is that in the shopping center with the, um, uh, Vietnam Memorial?

01:16:57.460 --> 01:17:04.180
Uh, no, it's the shopping center by my work where I take my kid.

01:17:04.180 --> 01:17:04.660
Yes.

01:17:04.660 --> 01:17:04.900
Okay.

01:17:05.700 --> 01:17:11.940
We don't want to give away everything, but the one that I was mentioning is like an enemy

01:17:11.940 --> 01:17:12.500
players.

01:17:12.500 --> 01:17:17.700
They're, they're very clearly won it for some reason and they bump it a lot.

01:17:17.700 --> 01:17:19.780
So anyway, that's why I was like, can I get a new portal there?

01:17:19.780 --> 01:17:20.900
Cause that's a problem.

01:17:20.900 --> 01:17:22.980
No, but there's new, there's new stores going in over there.

01:17:22.980 --> 01:17:27.540
So they're, they may try to choose bargain anyway.

01:17:27.540 --> 01:17:27.940
Yes.

01:17:27.940 --> 01:17:32.420
Um, so I, but I did work on, uh, programming a little bit for a couple hours.

01:17:32.420 --> 01:17:37.620
So I did that and I posted a, a funny little video on, on, uh, Twitter.

01:17:38.260 --> 01:17:39.780
Um, I met the place stuff this week.

01:17:39.780 --> 01:17:42.260
Actually, I met the place up earlier this afternoon.

01:17:42.260 --> 01:17:48.180
I downloaded our purchase and downloaded the Lego expansion for, um, Forza Horizon 4.

01:17:48.740 --> 01:17:53.940
And it looks amazing, but I had a killer migraine earlier this afternoon.

01:17:53.940 --> 01:18:00.340
So instead of playing the game because my kids were being very loud and obnoxious, I

01:18:00.340 --> 01:18:04.740
decided to lay in a dark room with my head on a pillow waiting for the pain to go away.

01:18:05.940 --> 01:18:07.460
So that's what I did instead.

01:18:07.460 --> 01:18:12.180
But I intend to play that and I've got, um, you know, my wife's going to be out of town

01:18:12.180 --> 01:18:15.460
this week, so that means I can stream possibly later at night.

01:18:15.460 --> 01:18:20.980
So I may end up streaming some Forza Horizon 4, uh, with the Lego DLC stuff because it

01:18:20.980 --> 01:18:21.620
looks amazing.

01:18:22.260 --> 01:18:22.980
Like, absolutely.

01:18:22.980 --> 01:18:25.540
Like that needs to be a full, they just need to make a full game of that.

01:18:25.540 --> 01:18:28.820
Well, you know, Bobby was just talking about it on his show cause I guess he played it

01:18:28.820 --> 01:18:30.420
and he says, I see why they didn't make it a full game.

01:18:30.420 --> 01:18:34.180
I guess there's, there are parts that aren't quite as filled out as others, but, um, they

01:18:34.180 --> 01:18:35.460
should fill it out.

01:18:35.460 --> 01:18:36.100
Okay.

01:18:36.100 --> 01:18:38.420
Anyway, um, let me talk about my gaming week.

01:18:38.420 --> 01:18:42.660
So I, I did, uh, make an effort to try to play some games, uh, that I haven't played

01:18:42.660 --> 01:18:42.980
yet.

01:18:42.980 --> 01:18:46.740
Uh, now not to say I didn't play my normal stuff cause I've still played Diablo three.

01:18:46.740 --> 01:18:52.580
I just got my silver season badge unlocked cause I, I, uh, beat a set dungeon was the

01:18:52.580 --> 01:18:53.300
last thing I needed.

01:18:53.300 --> 01:18:54.980
So now I'm working on my gold badge.

01:18:54.980 --> 01:18:57.780
So there's that, uh, I'm up to Paragon 180.

01:18:57.780 --> 01:18:58.740
So I'm doing pretty good.

01:18:58.740 --> 01:19:02.100
Um, usually you have to be a little bit further before you get silver, but I'm doing pretty

01:19:02.100 --> 01:19:02.500
good.

01:19:02.500 --> 01:19:05.700
And then of course, continuing to play Final Fantasy 14 gearing up for the expansion.

01:19:05.700 --> 01:19:10.500
I'm trying to get my machinist to level 70 because those abilities with the new machinist

01:19:10.500 --> 01:19:15.620
and, um, uh, I keep wanting to say storm blood, but that's the current expansion shadow bringers.

01:19:15.620 --> 01:19:20.340
I'm really excited about being able to, uh, use some of those newer abilities.

01:19:20.340 --> 01:19:22.660
So, um, yeah, I want to get my machinist to 70.

01:19:22.660 --> 01:19:24.260
So that's the stuff I've been playing.

01:19:24.260 --> 01:19:28.580
Now, some new stuff, uh, I went, well, I went back to Beat Saber, but the reason why is

01:19:28.580 --> 01:19:32.420
because they released a pack for Beat Saber.

01:19:32.420 --> 01:19:35.700
That is 10 Imagine Dragons songs.

01:19:35.700 --> 01:19:36.100
That's right.

01:19:36.100 --> 01:19:39.780
The band, Imagine Dragons, they put their songs in Beat Saber, which I have to admit

01:19:39.780 --> 01:19:44.420
at first, I was a little bit like, this is weird because that's not the usual type of

01:19:44.420 --> 01:19:46.580
song that you have in Beat Saber.

01:19:46.580 --> 01:19:47.940
But I think that's the point.

01:19:47.940 --> 01:19:50.180
They want to put different types of songs into Beat Saber.

01:19:50.180 --> 01:19:54.020
Keep in mind, I don't play on the PC where I understand the game has been modded to hell

01:19:54.020 --> 01:19:55.620
and every song you can think of is in it.

01:19:55.620 --> 01:20:00.740
But, um, I kind of agree with Bobby on this, the modding community, most of the time, not

01:20:00.740 --> 01:20:06.100
all the time, wants to just flex their pain on how difficult can we make these songs.

01:20:06.100 --> 01:20:08.660
And that's not fun for me.

01:20:08.660 --> 01:20:13.540
Fun for some of you Beat Saber experts, but those of us that can't move that fast, it's

01:20:13.540 --> 01:20:14.500
just not as fun.

01:20:14.500 --> 01:20:15.940
Like I watch other people do it.

01:20:15.940 --> 01:20:16.260
Neat.

01:20:16.260 --> 01:20:16.740
I agree.

01:20:16.740 --> 01:20:18.420
It's like the DDR community.

01:20:18.420 --> 01:20:23.460
It's basically, this is why it is the DDR thing all over again.

01:20:23.460 --> 01:20:25.700
It's why In the Groove was so hard.

01:20:25.700 --> 01:20:32.100
It's why the new songs that seem to come out from Konami on the new DDR games are so

01:20:32.100 --> 01:20:36.580
goddamn hard is because that's where a lot of players want to play.

01:20:37.220 --> 01:20:40.420
But sometimes, you know, it's just fun just to play a song.

01:20:40.420 --> 01:20:44.500
It's sometimes fun when the hand waves go with the drum beat and you can almost like

01:20:44.500 --> 01:20:45.140
freestyle a little bit.

01:20:45.140 --> 01:20:45.780
Oh yes, that's right.

01:20:45.780 --> 01:20:50.980
I did play DDR this week in a 111 degree garage and I regretted it immediately.

01:20:51.940 --> 01:20:52.900
And I streamed it though.

01:20:52.980 --> 01:20:53.940
So yeah.

01:20:54.820 --> 01:20:59.700
Anyway, so yeah, Metal Mayhem in chat says Imagine Dragons has nine songs above and beyond

01:20:59.700 --> 01:21:00.660
Radioactive.

01:21:00.660 --> 01:21:01.940
That was kind of my first thing too.

01:21:01.940 --> 01:21:06.900
And that song in particular Radioactive is just, it's been played to death on the radio.

01:21:06.900 --> 01:21:09.380
And let me tell you what really bugs me about that song.

01:21:10.100 --> 01:21:14.260
Not to shit on Imagine Dragons because actually they've done a lot of like wonderful, awesome

01:21:14.260 --> 01:21:15.620
things for the LGBTQ community.

01:21:15.620 --> 01:21:16.740
So I give them a big thumbs up.

01:21:16.740 --> 01:21:21.140
They are very actively involved with that because I guess the guy is a Mormon, was a

01:21:21.140 --> 01:21:25.220
Mormon, and has worked a lot with Mormons and the coming out thing.

01:21:25.220 --> 01:21:26.820
So thumbs up to you, dude.

01:21:26.820 --> 01:21:28.340
I'm not going to talk a lot of shit.

01:21:28.340 --> 01:21:32.580
But that song Radioactive, the part that bugs me is that there's some line in it that says

01:21:33.380 --> 01:21:40.580
I inhale the chemicals and there's like a clip of him taking a big breath.

01:21:40.580 --> 01:21:44.340
And I'm like, oh God, that's like listening to somebody chew their food very loudly.

01:21:45.140 --> 01:21:46.340
Why is that in a song?

01:21:46.340 --> 01:21:49.300
And I always want to change the channel when I hear that on the radio.

01:21:49.940 --> 01:21:53.780
But that song aside, some of their other songs are actually pretty good.

01:21:53.780 --> 01:21:54.420
I like that.

01:21:54.420 --> 01:21:57.380
Like there's a song, it's the very first one, Bad Liar, I think it's called.

01:21:57.380 --> 01:22:01.860
That's like a slow song and it's got a nice little, it's got a good hook to it.

01:22:01.860 --> 01:22:03.300
And it's like a slow jam.

01:22:03.300 --> 01:22:06.900
So it's weird to play it in Beat Saber, but I'm kind of like, I'm kind of into this.

01:22:06.900 --> 01:22:13.220
Like it does what DDR did to some of those slower songs.

01:22:13.220 --> 01:22:17.220
And it's like, it invented its own beat to go with the song.

01:22:17.300 --> 01:22:24.900
And the way you kind of like make your own beat is kind of enhances the song a little bit.

01:22:24.900 --> 01:22:27.780
So I thought the note chart to that was a lot of fun.

01:22:27.780 --> 01:22:29.380
So that's probably my favorite song to play right now.

01:22:30.020 --> 01:22:30.420
All right.

01:22:30.420 --> 01:22:30.820
Yeah.

01:22:30.820 --> 01:22:31.540
So I enjoyed that.

01:22:33.060 --> 01:22:33.460
Let's see.

01:22:34.020 --> 01:22:38.100
Going to our chat over Twitch TV slash vog network.

01:22:38.820 --> 01:22:41.860
Dark Tetsuya says Radioactive just reminds me of USL.

01:22:41.860 --> 01:22:44.660
Travis used to play that song all the time on his Twitch days.

01:22:44.660 --> 01:22:46.100
Oh, he did, didn't he?

01:22:46.100 --> 01:22:46.820
That's right.

01:22:46.820 --> 01:22:48.580
I think there might've been like a parody or something too.

01:22:49.540 --> 01:22:49.940
Let's see.

01:22:50.580 --> 01:22:54.100
SJ100Matt talks about music game elitist across all platforms.

01:22:54.100 --> 01:22:54.340
Yep.

01:22:54.340 --> 01:22:54.660
Yep.

01:22:54.660 --> 01:22:55.460
It happens.

01:22:55.460 --> 01:22:58.420
Bobby Blackwolf reminds us Imagine Dragons are all drummers too.

01:22:58.420 --> 01:23:02.820
So it worked a lot better, but I doubt they designed the beat charts, but sure.

01:23:02.820 --> 01:23:06.900
Some of their songs probably lent themselves pretty well to the game because of that.

01:23:06.900 --> 01:23:10.660
Anyway, if you sample the songs, they're obviously all over YouTube.

01:23:10.660 --> 01:23:12.660
It's all of the like Imagine Dragons singles.

01:23:13.620 --> 01:23:18.100
Go look it up on YouTube and you'll probably make a decision if it's for you.

01:23:18.100 --> 01:23:19.620
Cause I think it's kind of nice.

01:23:19.620 --> 01:23:21.780
Anyway, other games I played.

01:23:21.780 --> 01:23:24.180
Trials of Mana I played quite a bit of this week.

01:23:24.180 --> 01:23:26.980
I already talked about that a little bit earlier in the show, so I won't recap too much.

01:23:26.980 --> 01:23:29.780
But I streamed probably about two and a half hours of me playing it.

01:23:29.780 --> 01:23:32.740
And yeah, I'm having fun enjoying that game.

01:23:32.740 --> 01:23:36.580
It's kind of interesting to revisit like Secret of Mana, but it's not Secret of Mana.

01:23:37.380 --> 01:23:41.780
And I'm having to adjust to the Super Nintendo way of playing things where

01:23:41.780 --> 01:23:44.340
sometimes things are a little bit clunkier and a little bit slower.

01:23:44.340 --> 01:23:47.460
Cause it battles we're not 60 frames a second like they are today.

01:23:47.460 --> 01:23:48.980
So, you know, it's taking a little bit of getting used to.

01:23:48.980 --> 01:23:53.940
But otherwise I'm really enjoying, otherwise I'm really enjoying like again,

01:23:53.940 --> 01:23:57.460
I am able to look at this game and go, wow, for considering the age of this game,

01:23:57.460 --> 01:23:59.940
the fact that it has like the branching storylines

01:23:59.940 --> 01:24:03.060
and the multiple beginnings of the game is kind of neat.

01:24:03.060 --> 01:24:05.140
Like, you know, you didn't see that in a lot of games back then.

01:24:05.140 --> 01:24:06.020
So that was pretty cool.

01:24:07.700 --> 01:24:10.100
And then the last game I played a bit of this week,

01:24:10.100 --> 01:24:14.020
because I bought that Xbox ultimate game pass, I should probably try something with it.

01:24:14.020 --> 01:24:17.300
So I played a game called Riverbond, which is like, it's like,

01:24:17.300 --> 01:24:19.220
it's like got like a voxel art style.

01:24:19.220 --> 01:24:23.780
So kind of like Minecraft VR style, but it's kind of like a platformer slash.

01:24:23.780 --> 01:24:28.500
You have like a sword and you have like a gun that you can shoot the other voxels with.

01:24:28.500 --> 01:24:31.060
So it's kind of like, that's a little bit of a platformer slash shooter

01:24:31.060 --> 01:24:32.340
adventure type of game.

01:24:32.340 --> 01:24:34.100
And it's, it's fine.

01:24:34.100 --> 01:24:36.980
I haven't played a lot of it, but so far it's, you know, it's,

01:24:37.060 --> 01:24:41.700
I like that you can change your main character to all these really different random things.

01:24:41.700 --> 01:24:43.860
So I've been playing as the eggplant emoji,

01:24:44.820 --> 01:24:46.820
because that's something you can play the game as.

01:24:46.820 --> 01:24:47.540
So why not?

01:24:47.540 --> 01:24:49.060
Don't shake your head at me, dark soccer.

01:24:49.060 --> 01:24:49.700
You know, it's funny.

01:24:49.700 --> 01:24:49.940
All right.

01:24:50.820 --> 01:24:51.780
It is pretty funny.

01:24:51.780 --> 01:24:54.340
It's a, an amused head shake.

01:24:54.340 --> 01:24:57.460
Now I will point out, because somebody tweeted me or emailed about this.

01:24:57.460 --> 01:25:00.980
I don't remember, but the next game I downloaded, I just haven't played it yet.

01:25:00.980 --> 01:25:04.980
I did download Supermarket Shriek, and I'm really excited to play that because that is.

01:25:04.980 --> 01:25:06.420
Oh, I do want to play that.

01:25:07.300 --> 01:25:11.140
And I didn't realize, apparently that is a game that you can partially control with your voice.

01:25:11.700 --> 01:25:13.060
I didn't know that was the thing.

01:25:13.060 --> 01:25:14.020
That's even better.

01:25:14.020 --> 01:25:15.780
That's why it's called Supermarket Shriek.

01:25:15.780 --> 01:25:17.860
So I'm, I'm, I'm gonna figure this out.

01:25:17.860 --> 01:25:19.220
Maybe I'll, maybe I'll do a live stream.

01:25:19.220 --> 01:25:19.700
We'll see.

01:25:19.700 --> 01:25:23.140
And I'll check that out this coming week, but that's the next game on a game pass ultimate.

01:25:23.140 --> 01:25:24.100
I'm going to take a look at it.

01:25:24.100 --> 01:25:27.780
I wanted, yeah, I do want to play like some more of these games.

01:25:27.780 --> 01:25:32.180
I wish I almost had the Xbox to like play that stuff, but I don't want to get an Xbox at this

01:25:32.180 --> 01:25:35.140
point, you know, not with the next console being right around the corner.

01:25:35.140 --> 01:25:35.940
Yeah, that's true.

01:25:35.940 --> 01:25:36.500
I understand.

01:25:36.500 --> 01:25:37.620
Do you kind of wait for that?

01:25:37.620 --> 01:25:41.300
Plus I have a PC, but like, you know, I understand.

01:25:41.300 --> 01:25:41.800
All right.

01:25:42.260 --> 01:25:46.420
Moving on, let's, let's go, let's go back to a time, you know, every week on this show,

01:25:46.420 --> 01:25:50.740
we take a look back and as much as we've discussed all the new stuff up to March,

01:25:50.740 --> 01:25:55.620
2020 through this year's E3, sometimes it's nice to revisit the classics and a segment

01:25:55.620 --> 01:25:57.220
we call the classic game of the week.

01:25:57.220 --> 01:26:00.260
And the way the classic game of the week works is that dark soccer is going to step into

01:26:00.260 --> 01:26:05.540
the gaming vault and find a game that she thinks, Hey, this game is 10 years old or more.

01:26:06.260 --> 01:26:07.540
This one's the or more.

01:26:07.540 --> 01:26:10.500
This one's are more, this one's about 20 in it.

01:26:10.500 --> 01:26:11.300
Close to it.

01:26:11.300 --> 01:26:11.800
Yeah.

01:26:12.020 --> 01:26:14.020
Cause it came out in November, 2000.

01:26:14.020 --> 01:26:14.580
Okay.

01:26:14.580 --> 01:26:15.620
So yeah, close to it.

01:26:15.620 --> 01:26:18.260
So, uh, this is one that you kids need to be revisiting.

01:26:18.260 --> 01:26:20.340
And I got to say it's, it's, it's so funny.

01:26:20.340 --> 01:26:23.220
Cause dark soccer wasn't at her computer when she was picking the game this week.

01:26:23.220 --> 01:26:24.660
So she's like, I want to do this game.

01:26:24.660 --> 01:26:25.780
I'm like, you already did that one.

01:26:25.780 --> 01:26:27.140
And I was going obscure too.

01:26:27.140 --> 01:26:27.640
Yeah.

01:26:27.860 --> 01:26:28.900
You already did that one.

01:26:28.900 --> 01:26:32.020
And then she picked this one and I was like, okay, she had to have done this game.

01:26:32.020 --> 01:26:34.820
And I was like, Oh my God, how has dark soccer not done this game?

01:26:34.820 --> 01:26:37.060
This game is legendary.

01:26:37.060 --> 01:26:38.020
So let's get to it.

01:26:38.020 --> 01:26:40.740
What is the classic game of the week this week?

01:26:40.740 --> 01:26:41.940
I picked sin and punishment.

01:26:42.980 --> 01:26:47.700
So basically it is a rail shooter slash shooting gallery game.

01:26:47.700 --> 01:26:50.820
It was a code developed by treasure and Nintendo.

01:26:50.820 --> 01:26:51.860
You know, it's treasure.

01:26:51.860 --> 01:26:54.980
It's gotta be freaking amaze balls.

01:26:54.980 --> 01:27:01.220
So it was published for the Nintendo 64 in 2000 and it takes place in the dystopian

01:27:01.220 --> 01:27:04.340
2007 because famine.

01:27:04.900 --> 01:27:11.780
And shit, but at any rate, um, uh, basically scientists have created a new species to raise

01:27:11.780 --> 01:27:14.900
this food, but of course there's things science shouldn't do.

01:27:14.900 --> 01:27:19.300
The species all, you know, mutate and go back and everything.

01:27:19.860 --> 01:27:25.540
So it has, um, the game is actually a unique one.

01:27:26.180 --> 01:27:31.060
Basically it, it is, um, you have two players, sake and IDON.

01:27:31.700 --> 01:27:37.460
But it uses a different layout for the Nintendo 64 controller.

01:27:37.460 --> 01:27:44.340
So it uses both the D pad and the control stick and it lets you strafe, jump and dodge

01:27:44.340 --> 01:27:48.180
on the screen while aiming your target.

01:27:49.060 --> 01:27:53.620
So you have to shoot at enemies and projectiles while dodging the attacks to progress through

01:27:53.620 --> 01:27:54.120
the game.

01:27:54.680 --> 01:28:01.480
So at any rate, um, this particular game had some of the longest development time for a

01:28:01.480 --> 01:28:02.600
game of its time.

01:28:03.320 --> 01:28:13.480
Um, it, uh, it started in 1997 with only four people on staff and, uh, basically it concluded

01:28:13.480 --> 01:28:20.680
in 2000 with more people that were involved in any of other treasures, um, previous projects.

01:28:21.320 --> 01:28:27.720
And it wanted to develop Sin and Punishment, um, with the design of the Nintendo 64 controller

01:28:27.720 --> 01:28:33.240
in mind, but they wanted to make a game where you hold the left side of the controller instead

01:28:33.240 --> 01:28:36.520
of the right side of the controller, which was average for most games.

01:28:37.400 --> 01:28:43.960
So they had some difficulty programming the game, the 3D rendering of the machine and

01:28:43.960 --> 01:28:48.520
trying to adapt 2D gameplay into the 3D environment was kind of weird.

01:28:48.520 --> 01:28:52.520
And the game was originally called Glass Soldier, but Nintendo renamed it to Sin and

01:28:52.520 --> 01:28:55.960
Punishment because they wanted to have a name that would stand out.

01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:59.640
It was released to pretty positive reviews.

01:29:00.280 --> 01:29:07.400
Um, it was, uh, definitely lauded for its high intensity and flashy graphics for its

01:29:07.400 --> 01:29:07.900
time.

01:29:08.360 --> 01:29:12.760
And then, um, a few even pointed out that Treasure has this amazing ability to reduce

01:29:12.840 --> 01:29:19.720
their polygon count to maintain smooth gameplay, but keeping the graphics stylish, quote, quote,

01:29:19.720 --> 01:29:20.220
quote.

01:29:21.320 --> 01:29:25.880
Anyway, um, it was never released in the West, um, and it did get a pretty big following

01:29:25.880 --> 01:29:26.920
among import gamers.

01:29:26.920 --> 01:29:29.800
This is one that I never actually imported, but we had talked about.

01:29:30.520 --> 01:29:35.720
Um, and eventually people really started demanding it for the Virtual Console.

01:29:35.720 --> 01:29:42.040
So finally we had a Western release in 2007 for the Virtual Console and it is considered

01:29:42.040 --> 01:29:45.560
one of the best Nintendo 64 games ever.

01:29:45.560 --> 01:29:48.680
And it also was, uh, ported to the IQ player in China.

01:29:48.680 --> 01:29:49.800
You know the IQ is, right?

01:29:51.240 --> 01:29:52.520
Not the intelligent cube.

01:29:52.520 --> 01:29:53.000
Okay.

01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:54.680
It's I Q U E.

01:29:55.400 --> 01:30:00.120
So in China, they had passed a law that made video game consoles illegal.

01:30:00.120 --> 01:30:04.120
So the IQ was released as sort of, uh, a handheld unit.

01:30:04.120 --> 01:30:09.000
It wasn't a console and it came with different Nintendo 64 games that you could download

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:13.800
through a service or, you know, a few of them came pre-installed.

01:30:13.800 --> 01:30:16.360
So it's basically a handheld Nintendo 64.

01:30:17.160 --> 01:30:23.240
So anyway, um, it did have a sequel for the Wii in 2009 called Sin and Punishment Star

01:30:23.800 --> 01:30:24.440
Successor.

01:30:25.480 --> 01:30:32.680
Um, at any rate, um, it got great reviews all over the world and it was even reviewed,

01:30:32.680 --> 01:30:35.400
um, by Western, uh, gaming magazines.

01:30:35.720 --> 01:30:42.440
Like IGN just said it was, you know, a, and I'm going to use a quote, a tour de force

01:30:42.440 --> 01:30:44.280
of arcade style shooting action.

01:30:45.160 --> 01:30:50.280
And of course treasure has always been lauded for their, their, you know, just massively

01:30:50.280 --> 01:30:51.640
wonderful games.

01:30:51.640 --> 01:30:58.440
Um, uh, Eurogamer gave it a, um, a score of nine out of 10.

01:30:58.440 --> 01:31:02.280
Hamitsu said 35 out of 40, which is pretty good for Hamitsu.

01:31:02.920 --> 01:31:07.320
Um, but yeah, it got just really high ratings all over the place.

01:31:07.320 --> 01:31:12.040
A retro gamer, which is, uh, a magazine that I was collecting for a little while.

01:31:12.520 --> 01:31:16.760
Um, I like that when you had on the cover it have, you know, where it always says new

01:31:16.760 --> 01:31:20.760
there said old, we have a bunch of retro gamers.

01:31:20.760 --> 01:31:25.800
Um, but it listed Sin and Punishment on, uh, toward the top of their list in the top 10

01:31:25.800 --> 01:31:33.720
Nintendo 64 games with its intensity and, uh, the, uh, level of sophistication in their

01:31:33.720 --> 01:31:34.920
graphics.

01:31:34.920 --> 01:31:42.040
Um, and, um, it's one of the, this is one of the best games among shooting gallery games

01:31:42.040 --> 01:31:43.960
along with wild guns from 1984.

01:31:44.600 --> 01:31:50.520
Um, there was a novelization of the game that was released in Japan and, um, a comic that

01:31:50.520 --> 01:32:00.520
was, uh, printed in Dengeki Daioh magazine where Saki, um, was, uh, sorry, I was skipping

01:32:00.520 --> 01:32:00.840
on a bit.

01:32:00.840 --> 01:32:05.160
The character Saki appeared as an assist trophy in Super Smash Brothers Brawl.

01:32:06.360 --> 01:32:12.840
And, um, and then of course there was the sequel for Wii in 2009, Sin and Punishment

01:32:12.840 --> 01:32:13.560
Star Successor.

01:32:14.440 --> 01:32:22.440
Um, so the, uh, the Japanese name is, hold on, I miss reading that.

01:32:22.440 --> 01:32:24.760
This is, they, they mispronounced this.

01:32:24.760 --> 01:32:26.520
Hoshito Keishousha.

01:32:27.480 --> 01:32:29.560
Um, so Sin and Punishment.

01:32:29.560 --> 01:32:30.200
So there you go.

01:32:32.040 --> 01:32:32.440
That's it.

01:32:34.200 --> 01:32:34.760
All right.

01:32:34.760 --> 01:32:37.640
The classic game of the week and punishment.

01:32:37.640 --> 01:32:38.840
I'm sorry, I had the name wrong.

01:32:38.840 --> 01:32:40.040
Sumitobatsu.

01:32:40.040 --> 01:32:42.600
And it was Hoshino Keishousha.

01:32:42.600 --> 01:32:49.080
So the thing about this is that they changed, um, Chikyu to Hoshi because it's a different

01:32:49.080 --> 01:32:51.000
reading for the same Kanji.

01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:58.200
Um, so it was a big thing because it was called Earth Successor, but they changed the pronunciation

01:32:58.200 --> 01:32:58.680
of it.

01:32:58.680 --> 01:33:01.880
So anyway, I was misreading it because I knew that that wasn't the words.

01:33:01.880 --> 01:33:05.720
No worries, but what a great, you know, again, what we're looking at here, I think what we

01:33:05.720 --> 01:33:08.760
actually pulled the video from here for Twitch, for those of you that are watching along tonight,

01:33:08.760 --> 01:33:13.800
I think this is actually, uh, like on the Wii playing the N64 version of it.

01:33:13.800 --> 01:33:18.520
So I don't know if they enhanced it at all, but for an N64 game, this looks great.

01:33:18.520 --> 01:33:20.600
You know, you have to remember this is like a 20 year old game.

01:33:20.600 --> 01:33:23.880
And this was, I actually do believe it looks this good on Nintendo 64.

01:33:23.880 --> 01:33:25.320
I remember it being a good looking game.

01:33:25.320 --> 01:33:26.840
It has been a long time.

01:33:26.840 --> 01:33:31.000
Star Successor was even better, which is funny because let me go back to the studio shot

01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:35.400
here, but I remember when, um, Sin and Punishment Star Successor was announced and you like,

01:33:35.400 --> 01:33:36.840
were really excited about that.

01:33:36.840 --> 01:33:37.720
Obviously.

01:33:37.720 --> 01:33:39.480
Um, I kind of hope they do another one.

01:33:39.480 --> 01:33:43.560
I mean, if we're going to go revisit Panzer Dragoon, why not a Sin and Punishment 3?

01:33:43.560 --> 01:33:44.520
I think that'd be pretty awesome.

01:33:44.520 --> 01:33:48.120
It just might be hard to get the band back together to do it, but the switch is doing

01:33:48.120 --> 01:33:48.600
well enough.

01:33:48.600 --> 01:33:49.560
It might necessitate it.

01:33:49.560 --> 01:33:50.120
Right.

01:33:50.120 --> 01:33:51.320
Yeah, possibly.

01:33:51.320 --> 01:33:55.800
Maybe it'll be included with the Nintendo 64 classic edition whenever they do that.

01:33:55.800 --> 01:33:57.240
We never lose hope.

01:33:57.240 --> 01:33:59.800
We need more joy from a treasure anyway.

01:33:59.800 --> 01:34:01.400
Yeah, this treasure is happiness.

01:34:02.040 --> 01:34:02.520
All right.

01:34:02.520 --> 01:34:06.280
Well, um, we're going to get to our next segment here in a moment, but since we are, um, coming

01:34:06.280 --> 01:34:09.960
to a studio break here while we do this, uh, prior recorded segment, um, Dark Soccer,

01:34:09.960 --> 01:34:12.840
I know you have to leave us a little early tonight cause you have a work obligation really

01:34:12.840 --> 01:34:13.640
early in the morning.

01:34:13.640 --> 01:34:14.360
Fucking A.

01:34:14.360 --> 01:34:14.600
Yeah.

01:34:14.600 --> 01:34:14.920
Sorry to hear it.

01:34:14.920 --> 01:34:18.440
Basically, I've got training at work on Monday and Tuesday, which requires me to be up at

01:34:18.440 --> 01:34:19.560
five fucking 30 in the morning.

01:34:19.560 --> 01:34:22.280
Which is funny because I'm a trainer and I'm like, there's no way in hell I'd have class

01:34:22.280 --> 01:34:23.240
that early, but you're coming.

01:34:23.240 --> 01:34:24.520
Class starts at seven.

01:34:24.520 --> 01:34:25.800
Oh, yeah, but you gotta get up.

01:34:25.800 --> 01:34:26.760
I have to get up.

01:34:26.760 --> 01:34:27.560
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:34:27.560 --> 01:34:29.080
Cause it takes me about an hour to get ready.

01:34:29.080 --> 01:34:33.240
I mean, I can push it and get up at six, but I will look like, you know, the swamp monster.

01:34:33.240 --> 01:34:35.960
You got to put your face on, beat your face.

01:34:35.960 --> 01:34:37.240
Yeah, I understand.

01:34:37.800 --> 01:34:39.800
There's some days it's war paint.

01:34:41.240 --> 01:34:41.720
All right.

01:34:41.720 --> 01:34:45.640
Well, uh, before we let you go and say good night, Dark Soccer, um, first off, um, anything

01:34:45.640 --> 01:34:48.440
you want to say about E3 this year or something like you're really looking forward to, and

01:34:48.440 --> 01:34:56.040
then just any last thoughts for animal crossing bitches, aminal, animals crossing zoos makes

01:34:56.040 --> 01:34:57.000
me happy.

01:34:57.000 --> 01:34:59.880
Also eating cinnamon buns during the show made me happy too.

01:35:00.520 --> 01:35:00.680
Yeah.

01:35:00.680 --> 01:35:01.880
The cinnamon rolls are great.

01:35:01.880 --> 01:35:02.920
It's fucking IKEA.

01:35:02.920 --> 01:35:04.760
IKEA has the best.

01:35:04.760 --> 01:35:06.040
I know you, you had sent me that text.

01:35:06.040 --> 01:35:07.480
Like you want me to bring you any food from IKEA?

01:35:07.480 --> 01:35:09.000
And I was like, don't bring like meatballs.

01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:10.280
They're not going to hold the whole trip here.

01:35:10.280 --> 01:35:11.800
I'm like, bitch, I'm talking cinnamon rolls.

01:35:11.800 --> 01:35:12.040
Yeah, I know.

01:35:12.040 --> 01:35:13.160
But then you were like cinnamon rolls.

01:35:13.160 --> 01:35:15.960
I was like, Ooh, things I didn't know I need until she said it.

01:35:15.960 --> 01:35:16.680
I bought two trays.

01:35:16.680 --> 01:35:17.720
So I have a tray at home.

01:35:17.720 --> 01:35:18.040
All right.

01:35:18.040 --> 01:35:19.720
Well, um, have a great rest of your night, Dark Soccer.

01:35:19.720 --> 01:35:24.200
And we'll see you back here in seven days to celebrate 17 years of orange launch radio.

01:35:24.200 --> 01:35:26.280
If you can believe it next week.

01:35:26.280 --> 01:35:31.080
But you know, I'm glad that it's that weekend cause I'm going to be gone for San Francisco

01:35:31.080 --> 01:35:31.560
pride.

01:35:32.280 --> 01:35:33.720
Oh, the next weekend, right?

01:35:33.720 --> 01:35:34.120
Yeah.

01:35:34.120 --> 01:35:35.720
Cause I'm marching.

01:35:35.720 --> 01:35:37.800
We, I'm going to kind of decide.

01:35:37.800 --> 01:35:41.720
I just found out, I think Bobby's going to be gone that week and we're going to be up

01:35:41.720 --> 01:35:48.360
in Reno cause I don't want to brag, but I have VIP tickets to see Carly Rae Jepsen that

01:35:48.360 --> 01:35:48.920
Saturday.

01:35:50.360 --> 01:35:52.840
So, uh, up in Reno.

01:35:52.840 --> 01:35:57.560
So instead of going to SF pride, I'm going to Reno girl, but I'm going to a Carly Rae

01:35:57.560 --> 01:35:59.320
Jepsen concert, which is basically gay pride.

01:35:59.320 --> 01:36:00.040
Come on.

01:36:00.120 --> 01:36:01.560
So, uh, I'm going to that.

01:36:01.560 --> 01:36:04.920
And then, so there's a part of me, it's like, eh, why rush home from Reno to do the show?

01:36:04.920 --> 01:36:07.560
Maybe, maybe we'll, uh, so if you're not going to be here, I don't know.

01:36:07.560 --> 01:36:07.960
We'll see.

01:36:07.960 --> 01:36:08.280
We'll see.

01:36:08.280 --> 01:36:10.440
I feel more time to yourself.

01:36:12.440 --> 01:36:12.920
We'll see.

01:36:12.920 --> 01:36:13.160
I don't know.

01:36:13.160 --> 01:36:13.720
We'll talk about it.

01:36:13.720 --> 01:36:15.480
We'll talk about it in this coming week and see what we do.

01:36:15.480 --> 01:36:18.120
We can also record something in advance, like quickly or something.

01:36:18.120 --> 01:36:19.640
And who does that anymore?

01:36:19.640 --> 01:36:21.960
Um, well, I don't know what you can do on Twitch.

01:36:21.960 --> 01:36:22.200
All right.

01:36:22.200 --> 01:36:26.520
Anyway, I'll do this show myself or we experience that.

01:36:26.520 --> 01:36:32.600
I want everyone to pray for me and this has nothing to do with my training, but I have

01:36:32.600 --> 01:36:42.440
finally sat down and I'm learning logic pro so that I can do a podcast using the, um,

01:36:42.440 --> 01:36:44.040
the soundboard in logic pro.

01:36:45.080 --> 01:36:47.560
So pray for me, I'm, I'm learning it so far.

01:36:47.560 --> 01:36:49.640
I have made a really weird loop track.

01:36:49.640 --> 01:36:49.800
Good.

01:36:49.800 --> 01:36:52.360
And then what you learn, you can come over to this show and use.

01:36:52.360 --> 01:36:55.720
Well, I'm still planning on working on a theme song for us.

01:36:56.280 --> 01:36:59.080
Instead of, you know, something that doesn't sound like it's a dungeon crawler theme.

01:36:59.080 --> 01:37:01.400
I, Hey, now I sent you that track though.

01:37:01.400 --> 01:37:02.040
It sounded good.

01:37:02.040 --> 01:37:03.880
Oh, I thought you're, you're teasing the midi head thing.

01:37:03.880 --> 01:37:04.360
And I'm like that.

01:37:04.360 --> 01:37:04.920
No, no, no.

01:37:04.920 --> 01:37:06.040
I'm talking about mine.

01:37:06.040 --> 01:37:06.440
Oh no.

01:37:06.440 --> 01:37:08.920
You remember the first one that I made learning garage.

01:37:08.920 --> 01:37:11.000
Maybe you were like, here, what do you think about this for an OLR intro?

01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:15.800
And I was like, no, no, no, not that I did another one for an OLR intro, but I did one

01:37:15.800 --> 01:37:18.840
that I sent you that sounds like it's a cave video game theme.

01:37:18.840 --> 01:37:22.120
And I was like, I love that you're expressing your art.

01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:25.720
I'm not sure it's the right fit for a show intro.

01:37:25.720 --> 01:37:26.680
It's not peppy enough.

01:37:26.680 --> 01:37:31.240
I need, no, I need to send, I, I, I, I kind of want to play it at some point for people

01:37:31.240 --> 01:37:35.800
just to get some feedback, but yeah, it's, I'm, I'm learning my way through that and

01:37:35.800 --> 01:37:39.160
there's better loops, uh, available in logic.

01:37:39.160 --> 01:37:40.040
All right, cool.

01:37:40.600 --> 01:37:41.000
All right.

01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:42.280
Well, we'll see you next week.

01:37:42.280 --> 01:37:46.600
Uh, in the meantime, we're going to go to a prior recorded segment earlier where I sat

01:37:46.600 --> 01:37:50.600
down with some of the, uh, Pokemon biggest Pokemon fans here at the voice geeks network

01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:55.560
to talk a little bit about some of this news when it comes to Pokemon generation eight.

01:37:55.560 --> 01:37:58.760
But, um, just a quick FYI guys, and I'm going to apologize in advance.

01:37:58.760 --> 01:38:03.720
I, the audio for this kind of got screwed up a little bit and my voice is much louder

01:38:03.720 --> 01:38:05.240
than the other people's voices.

01:38:05.240 --> 01:38:06.280
So I'm really sorry about that.

01:38:06.280 --> 01:38:08.520
That was a fail on my part, not on their part.

01:38:08.520 --> 01:38:11.160
Because I was using the same setup I use for game streaming.

01:38:11.160 --> 01:38:14.280
And usually I have the audio down on the game so I can talk over that.

01:38:14.280 --> 01:38:19.240
And oops, it meant, so I'm going to try to fix it for the podcast, but just so you guys

01:38:19.240 --> 01:38:23.240
know, um, just, it may sound a little off here as we air it live.

01:38:23.240 --> 01:38:26.920
And I apologize for that, but please listen to what our guests tonight have to say here

01:38:26.920 --> 01:38:29.240
about the Pokemon gen eight controversy.

01:38:30.760 --> 01:38:31.160
Okay.

01:38:31.160 --> 01:38:35.160
So I thought for our studio break this week, we could do something a little different.

01:38:35.160 --> 01:38:39.480
Usually I'm like playing a game or something here and no, I'm not playing Pokemon sword

01:38:39.480 --> 01:38:41.480
and shield, which is what's showing behind me.

01:38:41.480 --> 01:38:45.080
But I thought, uh, this is actually just the Nintendo direct, uh, from a few days ago,

01:38:45.080 --> 01:38:46.440
a couple of weeks, I guess at this point.

01:38:46.600 --> 01:38:50.440
But I thought what we could do is actually talk about kind of a little bit of controversy

01:38:50.440 --> 01:38:54.440
that came up about Pokemon generation eight, uh, from this year's E3 announcements.

01:38:54.440 --> 01:38:58.920
And I thought, you know, to talk about this, why don't we invite on some Pokemon fans from

01:38:58.920 --> 01:39:00.120
around the voice of geeks network?

01:39:00.120 --> 01:39:04.360
So I'm joined tonight by of course, of course, if Pokemon comes up on orange launch radio,

01:39:04.360 --> 01:39:05.480
of course, Shane's going to be here.

01:39:05.480 --> 01:39:05.960
Hi, Shane.

01:39:06.760 --> 01:39:07.480
Hello.

01:39:07.480 --> 01:39:08.200
Hey, how are you doing?

01:39:09.160 --> 01:39:10.120
I'm fine.

01:39:10.120 --> 01:39:10.760
Good.

01:39:10.760 --> 01:39:14.840
And also joining Shane and I tonight, uh, you also know from the voice geeks network

01:39:14.840 --> 01:39:18.360
from the show game buoy, but you might've also heard, uh, another show that this guy

01:39:18.360 --> 01:39:21.560
was on called stab cast for same type attack bonus.

01:39:21.560 --> 01:39:22.680
Say hello to first mate.

01:39:22.680 --> 01:39:23.240
Slide kick.

01:39:24.200 --> 01:39:25.880
Hi, how are you?

01:39:27.160 --> 01:39:27.960
I'm all right.

01:39:27.960 --> 01:39:28.360
Just good.

01:39:28.360 --> 01:39:31.000
I'm ready to talk about some Pokemans.

01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:31.240
Yeah.

01:39:31.240 --> 01:39:32.120
Let's talk about it.

01:39:32.120 --> 01:39:37.160
So, um, so I guess let me try to like summarize this in a nutshell and Shane, as usual, you

01:39:37.160 --> 01:39:38.600
can correct everything that I got wrong.

01:39:38.600 --> 01:39:39.000
Okay.

01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:40.200
Um, so okay.

01:39:40.200 --> 01:39:42.440
I'm ready to do so.

01:39:43.560 --> 01:39:43.960
Okay.

01:39:44.040 --> 01:39:48.680
So here's the deal is that my understanding, at least, you know, I, I like Pokemon, but

01:39:48.680 --> 01:39:51.880
I don't buy 17 copies of the game like you do, Shane.

01:39:51.880 --> 01:39:54.120
Um, but my understand, okay, here's my understanding.

01:39:54.120 --> 01:39:58.040
So there's a lot of like cool stuff about Pokemon sword and shield and Jenny.

01:39:58.040 --> 01:40:01.960
And that is that, you know, um, you're going to have like, what is it like random encounters

01:40:01.960 --> 01:40:03.800
mixed with encounters that you see in the wild.

01:40:03.800 --> 01:40:04.040
Right.

01:40:04.040 --> 01:40:08.520
So you can like actually encounters plus your random encounters still.

01:40:08.520 --> 01:40:11.800
And there's yeah, there's what they want there.

01:40:11.800 --> 01:40:14.760
And there's, um, like a 3d world, which looks really cool to me.

01:40:14.760 --> 01:40:18.760
I liked the way the space looked like, instead of like just a 2d map, it looked a little

01:40:18.760 --> 01:40:21.880
bit more like, I don't know, yeah, it looked pretty cool.

01:40:21.880 --> 01:40:24.520
So anyway, but here's the controversial part.

01:40:24.520 --> 01:40:25.960
If y'all haven't heard yet.

01:40:25.960 --> 01:40:30.680
So what's happening is that of course, Pokemon kind of brands itself as the game as got to

01:40:30.680 --> 01:40:31.400
catch them all.

01:40:31.400 --> 01:40:31.640
Right.

01:40:31.640 --> 01:40:37.240
And at this point, now that we're eight generations in, we're looking at over 800 Pokemon are

01:40:37.240 --> 01:40:40.760
going to exist in the universe by the time this game comes out.

01:40:40.760 --> 01:40:45.640
So one thing that was announced is that, uh, in this game, you're only going to be able

01:40:45.640 --> 01:40:50.440
to catch Pokemon that are part of the Galar regional decks.

01:40:50.440 --> 01:40:54.200
And that doesn't necessarily mean it's just the new Pokemon.

01:40:54.200 --> 01:40:58.280
There are some old Pokemon mixed in there, and we even see it, uh, in this direct, we

01:40:58.280 --> 01:41:02.520
see some, you know, notable, like I saw Raichu go by a minute ago, obviously Charizard's

01:41:02.520 --> 01:41:03.480
back there right now.

01:41:03.480 --> 01:41:08.360
So we know some of the old Pokemon will be back, but not all of the old Pokemon will

01:41:08.360 --> 01:41:08.840
be back.

01:41:08.840 --> 01:41:12.120
And this is causing quite a bit of controversy.

01:41:12.120 --> 01:41:14.040
So let me start with Shane.

01:41:14.040 --> 01:41:15.080
What's your angle?

01:41:15.080 --> 01:41:16.200
Well, first, did I get it right?

01:41:16.200 --> 01:41:17.720
And B, what's your angle on all this?

01:41:17.720 --> 01:41:21.320
So yeah, you, you basically got it right.

01:41:21.320 --> 01:41:29.160
What they're saying is that what they have basically curated to be the Pokemon in the

01:41:29.160 --> 01:41:35.480
Galar region, um, that's it, nothing else can come in no matter what.

01:41:36.360 --> 01:41:40.360
In old games like Sun and Moon, um, which we briefly talked about, uh, before the call

01:41:40.360 --> 01:41:46.520
started, uh, you had your regional decks, which is everything you can catch in Sun and

01:41:46.520 --> 01:41:47.240
Moon.

01:41:47.240 --> 01:41:49.640
And then in most games you had a national decks.

01:41:49.640 --> 01:41:54.520
You didn't in this one, which was fine, but because you could still bring your old Pokemon

01:41:54.520 --> 01:42:00.280
from black and white, from Ruby Sapphire, from X and Y, all those, you could still bring

01:42:00.280 --> 01:42:02.360
in at a certain point in the game.

01:42:02.360 --> 01:42:07.800
Basically, uh, I couldn't, I don't remember if it was after you were done or just whenever

01:42:07.800 --> 01:42:09.000
you had access to bank.

01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:12.600
It's, it's been a while since I played Sun and Moon cause it's not that great.

01:42:12.600 --> 01:42:16.360
Um, but in this one, you can't do that at all.

01:42:16.360 --> 01:42:19.720
So my feelings, I was torn at first.

01:42:19.720 --> 01:42:21.400
Oh no, I wasn't torn at first.

01:42:21.400 --> 01:42:23.000
I didn't care at first.

01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:29.640
Um, I have a living decks in Pokemon bank, uh, that I don't want to say I worked hard

01:42:29.640 --> 01:42:30.120
to make.

01:42:30.120 --> 01:42:31.880
It wasn't that bad really.

01:42:31.880 --> 01:42:37.800
Um, and I've been working on shinies for years and not being able to bring them all over

01:42:39.080 --> 01:42:44.680
to me personally, I don't mind it for how I play the game.

01:42:45.560 --> 01:42:49.240
But wait quickly, how do, how quickly, how do you play the game?

01:42:49.800 --> 01:42:50.440
Summarize that.

01:42:51.240 --> 01:42:56.760
So I just, I, I play the game from start to finish, like just by catching what's there.

01:42:56.760 --> 01:43:03.080
I don't import anything over unless I'm specifically trying to do something like I made a team

01:43:03.080 --> 01:43:08.920
of smear goal for ultra Sun and ultra Moon so I could catch shinies easier.

01:43:08.920 --> 01:43:13.560
Um, but beyond that, it's not like I have some Pokemon that I've had for forever.

01:43:13.560 --> 01:43:19.560
I have, uh, I have a Pokemon from my original copy of diamond.

01:43:19.560 --> 01:43:23.880
I think it was that I've carried over since then.

01:43:23.880 --> 01:43:29.960
Um, so that's years and years at this point, but I don't use them in any post game things.

01:43:29.960 --> 01:43:31.720
I use them basically for breeding.

01:43:31.720 --> 01:43:36.600
If I need to, even my beloved Oshawa, I don't bring them over.

01:43:36.600 --> 01:43:40.600
It's not unless I'm hatching or something like that.

01:43:40.600 --> 01:43:42.360
It's not that big of a deal to me.

01:43:42.360 --> 01:43:44.760
So you're, so you're, you're at peace with this.

01:43:44.760 --> 01:43:47.880
You're, you did not participate in the rabble rabble or, or.

01:43:48.840 --> 01:43:57.560
So no, I did not participate in all the angry people mob thing, but like after a little

01:43:57.560 --> 01:44:04.520
bit of reflection and reading some stories, I, well, I'm not personally affected by this.

01:44:04.520 --> 01:44:10.200
I am upset for the people that are, and I do want them to change their stance.

01:44:10.760 --> 01:44:17.320
Um, I read a story about some guy who traded Pokemon with his friend when they were younger

01:44:17.320 --> 01:44:20.600
and his friend got terminally ill and gave him all his Pokemon.

01:44:20.600 --> 01:44:21.800
That friend died.

01:44:21.800 --> 01:44:28.120
And now those Pokemon technically have outlived how old that person's friend was.

01:44:28.120 --> 01:44:33.320
Uh, by the time that they had passed away, I'm like, okay, well, some, a story like that

01:44:33.320 --> 01:44:37.720
makes me realize, Hey, some of these mean more to people than they do to me.

01:44:37.720 --> 01:44:41.880
And so they shouldn't like be upset about this.

01:44:41.880 --> 01:44:44.280
They should, they should get what they want out of it.

01:44:44.280 --> 01:44:47.320
Well, let me, let me ask John a question too, because I definitely want to hear your take

01:44:47.320 --> 01:44:48.200
on this too, John.

01:44:48.200 --> 01:44:53.560
Um, I know there's been a lot of, there's been a lot of rabble rabble as I described

01:44:53.560 --> 01:44:59.320
it on Twitter so far as, you know, we saw a good old change.org petition, uh, asking

01:44:59.320 --> 01:45:03.000
for Nintendo to reverse their decision on this and change this.

01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:04.520
What's your take on all this, John?

01:45:04.520 --> 01:45:07.960
How did you feel when you were like seeing this petition and hearing all this news?

01:45:08.200 --> 01:45:13.560
I mean, honestly, it's, it's, you know, it made me think of, uh, you know, you and I

01:45:13.560 --> 01:45:18.760
do a show reading is fundamental about RuPaul's Drag Race, which, you know, for quite a few

01:45:18.760 --> 01:45:23.240
years now has had a lot of fans behaving badly.

01:45:23.800 --> 01:45:29.800
And I mean, I haven't really followed like the, I mean, I, I can't say I haven't followed

01:45:29.800 --> 01:45:30.600
the Pokemon fandom.

01:45:30.600 --> 01:45:36.920
I've been, you know, on Pokemon, like web forums since I was in high school and everything.

01:45:37.880 --> 01:45:42.280
But like, you know, in terms of like, you know, especially these days with like social

01:45:42.280 --> 01:45:47.880
media and everything and Reddit, like I don't really, um, typically have a pulse on what

01:45:47.880 --> 01:45:55.000
the Pokemon fandom is like these days, but it, I mean, I kind of thought that, you know,

01:45:55.000 --> 01:46:03.400
it seemed like a decent community, but, uh, I just think people are, um, like I heard

01:46:03.400 --> 01:46:09.560
that people on the Nintendo tree house streams for completely non Pokemon games were like,

01:46:09.560 --> 01:46:13.720
um, just complaining about no national Pokedex.

01:46:14.840 --> 01:46:20.600
And so I think like, I mean, I personally feel like, um, there are so many Pokemon and

01:46:20.600 --> 01:46:25.800
I definitely understand what other people, um, you know, I understand the other side

01:46:25.800 --> 01:46:28.120
of the argument, but for me, there's so many Pokemon.

01:46:28.760 --> 01:46:35.160
And what I always find is that like, you know, like I'm the type of person who typically

01:46:36.120 --> 01:46:42.280
tries to build like one team that I, you know, maybe, maybe not like consistent from the

01:46:42.280 --> 01:46:46.120
beginning because you know, that you catch them, you might maybe catch some later in

01:46:46.120 --> 01:46:51.240
the game or whatever, but like, I kind of like try to look at, you know, like types

01:46:51.240 --> 01:46:56.360
and like, you know, trying to aim for one team that I like, you know, bring up to the

01:46:56.360 --> 01:46:58.440
elite four and the Pokemon league or whatever.

01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:05.640
Um, so I mean, I already feel like there are so many Pokemon that I don't really get a

01:47:05.640 --> 01:47:13.160
chance to, um, you know, uh, have a, have a chance to play with or, you know, really,

01:47:14.920 --> 01:47:15.960
um, experience.

01:47:15.960 --> 01:47:21.960
So, I mean, adding a bunch of old Pokemon in there is only going to, you know, kind

01:47:21.960 --> 01:47:27.880
of increase the temptation like, Oh, well I want a, you know, such and such, um,

01:47:27.880 --> 01:47:31.800
I want a Pikachu and a Jigglypuff because those are the things I'm familiar with.

01:47:31.800 --> 01:47:32.300
Right.

01:47:33.720 --> 01:47:33.880
Right.

01:47:33.880 --> 01:47:38.520
Or like you said, you might have a favorite and, you know, you want your favorite or you're

01:47:38.520 --> 01:47:41.880
like, Oh, you know, this one has a really unique type and, you know, I want to build

01:47:41.880 --> 01:47:42.600
my team around that.

01:47:42.600 --> 01:47:43.400
So, I mean, I don't know.

01:47:43.400 --> 01:47:49.240
I think it's going to, I hope that it's going to encourage people to, you know, give the

01:47:49.240 --> 01:47:50.360
new Pokemon a chance.

01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:56.600
What I will say though, is I really feel like, and I mean, I don't know if this is like,

01:47:56.600 --> 01:48:03.160
you know, pointless or, you know, worthless at this point, but, um, you know, I think

01:48:03.160 --> 01:48:07.160
back to the Pokemon stadium games and I guess the reason, you know, the reason why they

01:48:07.160 --> 01:48:11.960
originally existed was because, you know, the original games were on Game Boy and they

01:48:11.960 --> 01:48:15.960
were, you know, pixels and it was like your way to see your Pokemon in 3d and everything,

01:48:16.040 --> 01:48:21.960
but this might not be a bad time to start looking at bringing back if this is going

01:48:21.960 --> 01:48:25.640
to be kind of their method moving forward, which they said it is.

01:48:26.760 --> 01:48:26.920
Yeah.

01:48:26.920 --> 01:48:33.400
So if that's really remains true, it might not be a bad idea to have some sort of like

01:48:33.400 --> 01:48:35.800
cross-platform mobile.

01:48:35.800 --> 01:48:41.560
And cause then that way the people on Pokemon go could still participate, have like a mobile

01:48:42.280 --> 01:48:46.360
and, um, switch cross-platform thing.

01:48:46.360 --> 01:48:48.120
That's kind of like a Pokemon stadium.

01:48:48.120 --> 01:48:53.080
And it could have like a little Pokemon farm or whatever that, um, one game was like a

01:48:53.080 --> 01:48:57.480
Pokemon show off space, like a Pokemon show off Pokemon ranch or something that you could

01:48:57.480 --> 01:48:58.200
show everything off.

01:48:58.200 --> 01:49:04.200
So you can like play with your Pokemon and you can, um, battle with them like in a separate,

01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:06.680
you know, situation.

01:49:06.680 --> 01:49:09.320
And then that way they could, you know, just continually update it.

01:49:10.280 --> 01:49:13.080
Shane, Shane, did you want to follow up on that before I go to another question?

01:49:13.800 --> 01:49:17.160
Well, yeah, that's kind of what Pokemon home is supposed to be for.

01:49:17.160 --> 01:49:19.480
They've stated it's where they're supposed to live.

01:49:19.480 --> 01:49:25.800
Now, the problem with that is people I'm saying people being a little general here, a lot

01:49:25.800 --> 01:49:31.160
of players from what I've read and I take the same stance.

01:49:31.160 --> 01:49:37.720
It feels like it's more just like a holding area at this point, no matter what they do

01:49:37.720 --> 01:49:44.440
for Pokemon home, it's they're charging you to keep your Pokemon there until you can bring

01:49:44.440 --> 01:49:47.560
them in, which who knows what generation at this point you'll get to do that.

01:49:47.560 --> 01:49:52.360
And that seems like a really, really bad decision.

01:49:52.360 --> 01:49:52.680
Okay.

01:49:52.680 --> 01:49:57.080
So my personal take on this whole thing, like, you know, I'm more of a casual Pokemon fan,

01:49:57.080 --> 01:49:57.720
obviously.

01:49:57.720 --> 01:50:02.840
And, um, there's a part of me that's kind of like, you know, it does, when you do say

01:50:02.840 --> 01:50:06.680
gotta catch them all, it is a little weird to be saying we're going to release this game

01:50:06.680 --> 01:50:08.680
and you really can't catch them all.

01:50:08.680 --> 01:50:12.520
You know, and I got to admit, there's, there's, I mean, I think at the end of the day, let's

01:50:12.520 --> 01:50:13.800
not, I'm not going to kid myself.

01:50:13.800 --> 01:50:15.160
I'm still going to buy the game.

01:50:15.160 --> 01:50:19.320
And I honestly think a lot of people out there that are upset will probably end up buying

01:50:19.320 --> 01:50:19.800
the game anyway.

01:50:19.800 --> 01:50:22.840
Not that I'm trying to invalidate the way anybody feels or anything like that, especially

01:50:22.840 --> 01:50:26.440
with like some of the compelling stories you told Shane, like that completely makes sense.

01:50:26.440 --> 01:50:31.720
But I do feel like when it comes down to the money, like it's not really going to change.

01:50:31.720 --> 01:50:35.800
But I do have to admit, I get a little side eye with Game Freak because I even feel like

01:50:35.800 --> 01:50:40.040
when they introduce Pokemon bank, they kind of set the stage as, oh, well, this is the

01:50:40.040 --> 01:50:44.040
way you're going to store all your Pokemon in the future and be able to take your Pokemon

01:50:44.040 --> 01:50:49.240
into future games and kind of gave that impression that like, you know, well, and then they put

01:50:49.240 --> 01:50:51.000
Pokemon home out on top of Pokemon bank.

01:50:51.720 --> 01:50:51.960
Yeah.

01:50:51.960 --> 01:50:57.080
Well, and just to quickly interject, literally two weeks before this information happened,

01:50:57.080 --> 01:51:01.880
they had that big presentation where they were saying how important or how they know

01:51:01.880 --> 01:51:07.320
how important these Pokemon that we've raised since their first games they like they appeared

01:51:07.320 --> 01:51:08.440
in are to us.

01:51:08.440 --> 01:51:14.280
And that's what Pokemon home was supposed to to accomplish was being the new Pokemon

01:51:14.280 --> 01:51:19.560
bank so we can bring our friends over into the new games.

01:51:19.560 --> 01:51:23.400
And it seems to fly right in the face of that what they have chosen.

01:51:24.200 --> 01:51:27.400
Let me ask one more question and then for time, I got to go ahead and wrap up here.

01:51:27.400 --> 01:51:29.560
But and I'll start with John on this question.

01:51:29.640 --> 01:51:34.600
But I think there's probably like a cynical part of me, especially looking at a lot of

01:51:34.600 --> 01:51:39.320
E3 releases this year that kind of goes, for example, the Final Fantasy 7 remake.

01:51:39.320 --> 01:51:41.640
Okay, Episode One is coming out on PlayStation 4.

01:51:41.640 --> 01:51:44.680
But then what comes out the very next year, the PlayStation 5.

01:51:44.680 --> 01:51:48.360
So they're going to get you to buy the Final Fantasy remake Episode One all over again

01:51:48.360 --> 01:51:51.480
in preparation for Episode Two, which will probably be on the PlayStation 5.

01:51:51.480 --> 01:51:55.960
How I'm tying that to Pokemon is that this is the way that they say that Pokemon Sword

01:51:55.960 --> 01:51:57.240
and Shield is going to be.

01:51:57.240 --> 01:52:00.760
But I think inevitably there will be a Pokemon gun, right?

01:52:00.760 --> 01:52:03.320
Or we're all joking, calling it a Pokemon gun.

01:52:03.320 --> 01:52:08.600
But there will be some sort of the equivalent of yellow, the equivalent of the best of or

01:52:08.600 --> 01:52:09.240
whatever.

01:52:09.240 --> 01:52:14.760
And perhaps that will be the game that you can bring all your Pokemon into.

01:52:14.760 --> 01:52:18.840
Is that how you kind of forecast this going, John?

01:52:18.840 --> 01:52:22.280
Or do you think that nope, this is going to just stay this way?

01:52:22.280 --> 01:52:24.440
Yeah, it's definitely possible.

01:52:26.520 --> 01:52:31.240
Like, I mean, I feel like they've got some thing in the works, like, whether it's that

01:52:31.240 --> 01:52:39.800
or, you know, some sort of, like I said, a colosseum sort of thing that can really connect

01:52:39.800 --> 01:52:41.720
with Pokemon home.

01:52:42.280 --> 01:52:48.040
Like, I feel like there's going to be some sort of experience that like, I mean, I don't

01:52:48.040 --> 01:52:53.000
know, maybe it's just maybe you can bring all your Pokemon into Pokemon sleep and sleep

01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:54.920
with sleep with all your favorite Pokemon.

01:52:54.920 --> 01:52:58.360
No, I do think that's an interesting idea that's kind of come up from this discussion

01:52:58.360 --> 01:53:03.160
that I didn't think of before is that perhaps there will be some other type of Pokemon game

01:53:03.160 --> 01:53:07.000
where the main point of that game is to showcase your existing Pokemon.

01:53:07.880 --> 01:53:10.440
Quickly, and then we'll wrap up, Shane, the same question.

01:53:10.440 --> 01:53:13.960
Do you think this gets resolved in a Pokemon gun type of situation?

01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:17.480
I think they're too stubborn to do that.

01:53:17.480 --> 01:53:22.600
Another quick thing to point out is this game is also removing Megas and Z crystals.

01:53:23.160 --> 01:53:29.000
So that all those mechanics where you get new versions of Pokemon too, or awesome moves

01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:30.680
kind of those are gone too.

01:53:30.680 --> 01:53:37.640
And I feel like they, especially because the Japanese players via social media at least

01:53:37.640 --> 01:53:43.480
have now accepted the fact that they're not getting the old Pokemon because of what in

01:53:43.480 --> 01:53:45.000
interviews Game Freak has said.

01:53:45.640 --> 01:53:48.040
I think there, I think this is it.

01:53:48.040 --> 01:53:51.160
I think this is how it's going to be from now on, and they're not going to come back

01:53:51.160 --> 01:53:51.720
from it.

01:53:51.800 --> 01:53:55.400
I would hope for it differently, but I think they're done.

01:53:55.400 --> 01:53:58.120
This is their new direction and they're sticking to it.

01:53:58.680 --> 01:53:59.320
Okay.

01:53:59.320 --> 01:54:00.040
Well, fair enough.

01:54:00.040 --> 01:54:02.920
Well, they're waving goodbye in the direct, which means I'm running out of footage and

01:54:02.920 --> 01:54:04.520
I got to start it over here pretty soon.

01:54:04.520 --> 01:54:09.800
But while I do that, I want to wrap up here and head back to the studio live.

01:54:09.800 --> 01:54:12.040
I want to thank you both for joining me tonight for this side discussion.

01:54:12.040 --> 01:54:16.680
It was really cool and nice to talk about Pokemon with some Pokemon fans, but quickly

01:54:16.680 --> 01:54:18.680
before we head out, do you guys have anything you want to plug?

01:54:19.240 --> 01:54:21.720
Shane, I know you're not really hosting any shows right now.

01:54:21.720 --> 01:54:23.640
Is there anything you want to plug before we head out?

01:54:24.600 --> 01:54:26.280
Um, no.

01:54:26.840 --> 01:54:27.080
Okay.

01:54:27.080 --> 01:54:28.440
Well, thanks for being here nonetheless.

01:54:29.160 --> 01:54:33.400
Jon, I know you have a show because I've been listening to like the, what, like three episodes

01:54:33.400 --> 01:54:34.360
you just put out this week.

01:54:34.360 --> 01:54:35.720
So tell us a little bit about that, Jon.

01:54:36.360 --> 01:54:36.600
Yeah.

01:54:36.600 --> 01:54:41.080
We're gamebuoy.org, your port of call for gaming news and videos that maybe you don't

01:54:41.080 --> 01:54:42.760
turn your radar, but most definitely should be.

01:54:42.760 --> 01:54:46.680
We just did almost daily episodes about E3.

01:54:46.680 --> 01:54:50.520
So, you know, definitely, um, lots of news out there to digest.

01:54:50.520 --> 01:54:55.160
And we actually haven't even talked about Pokemon just because there's been so much

01:54:55.880 --> 01:54:57.240
in the gaming world.

01:54:57.240 --> 01:54:59.640
You guys are going to need a whole episode.

01:54:59.640 --> 01:55:01.960
You're going to need a whole episode for it anyway.

01:55:01.960 --> 01:55:02.440
All right.

01:55:02.440 --> 01:55:04.680
Thank you guys both for joining me tonight.

01:55:04.680 --> 01:55:09.720
Let's go back to the studio live for the continuation of Orange Lounge Radio tonight.

01:55:11.640 --> 01:55:11.960
All right.

01:55:11.960 --> 01:55:15.080
That was a fun little, uh, different type of break segment there.

01:55:15.080 --> 01:55:17.880
And Shane told me kind of like after we, we stopped recording and he's like, I could

01:55:17.880 --> 01:55:21.320
have gone on for another 30 minutes about, and I'm like, I bet I wouldn't stop there.

01:55:21.320 --> 01:55:22.440
It's too long of a break.

01:55:22.440 --> 01:55:26.520
If only we hadn't had a podcast at one point that was all about Pokemon.

01:55:26.520 --> 01:55:29.000
But anyway, did you also catch what I did in that video?

01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:31.320
By the way, I did like the number one thing you're not supposed to do.

01:55:31.320 --> 01:55:33.960
I wore my green shirt with my green screen today.

01:55:35.400 --> 01:55:42.360
Um, I didn't notice it then, but I did notice that the sheen from your light during your

01:55:42.360 --> 01:55:46.040
Square Enix thing was causing parts of your face to like come out.

01:55:46.040 --> 01:55:49.880
Well, part of the, I'm going to, I'm not going to throw Bobby under the bus for that completely,

01:55:49.880 --> 01:55:52.040
but actually he was controlling the green screen on his end.

01:55:52.040 --> 01:55:56.920
It wasn't my process against his, but, um, I think because the quality dips a little

01:55:56.920 --> 01:55:59.240
bit because he's pulling a Skype image.

01:55:59.240 --> 01:56:03.720
I think it just causes, yeah, it makes, it makes it, uh, wreak a little more havoc on

01:56:03.720 --> 01:56:05.880
it, but we're learning, we're playing fine.

01:56:05.880 --> 01:56:06.600
It was fine.

01:56:06.600 --> 01:56:07.320
It's fine.

01:56:07.320 --> 01:56:08.280
Mistakes are going to happen.

01:56:08.280 --> 01:56:09.240
It's, it's all good.

01:56:09.240 --> 01:56:12.360
So anyway, um, yeah.

01:56:12.360 --> 01:56:13.880
So what do you, what do you think on all that?

01:56:13.880 --> 01:56:15.960
You're just not, you're just not as big into Pokemon, right?

01:56:15.960 --> 01:56:18.920
I just don't really care too much that not all the Pokemon are in there.

01:56:18.920 --> 01:56:21.560
Cause I mean, you weren't going to catch them all anyway.

01:56:22.200 --> 01:56:22.840
No.

01:56:22.840 --> 01:56:23.160
All right.

01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:27.160
No, I mean, I, I haven't even finished.

01:56:27.160 --> 01:56:27.800
Let's go.

01:56:27.800 --> 01:56:31.800
Like, especially when they want you to do all the like challenges now where you have

01:56:31.800 --> 01:56:33.880
to become the master of all the different Pokemon.

01:56:33.880 --> 01:56:35.720
I'm like, no, no, I don't.

01:56:35.720 --> 01:56:36.600
I'm done.

01:56:36.600 --> 01:56:37.880
I need to check on the cat.

01:56:37.880 --> 01:56:39.800
Why don't we start some rapid fire news here?

01:56:41.080 --> 01:56:46.120
He's, he's trying to tear a hole through space and time or at least a box.

01:56:46.120 --> 01:56:46.620
Who knows?

01:56:47.160 --> 01:56:50.040
Anyways, let's talk a little bit about star control.

01:56:50.040 --> 01:56:53.000
So star control and star control origins.

01:56:53.560 --> 01:56:56.280
There was a lawsuit between those developers.

01:56:56.280 --> 01:57:01.480
And of course now they have decided that they are settling that lawsuit.

01:57:01.480 --> 01:57:02.040
Okay.

01:57:02.040 --> 01:57:03.160
This mush update is more important.

01:57:03.160 --> 01:57:04.280
Do you know what it is?

01:57:04.280 --> 01:57:04.680
No.

01:57:04.680 --> 01:57:07.000
Do you know how he moved the litter box to a covered litter box?

01:57:07.000 --> 01:57:08.600
He's using the litter box right now.

01:57:08.600 --> 01:57:10.600
We don't usually have that during OLR.

01:57:10.600 --> 01:57:12.120
So what we had to do, so Mr.

01:57:12.120 --> 01:57:17.240
Smoosh really loves to dig in the litter box a lot.

01:57:17.240 --> 01:57:22.280
And so he had a litter box that was in the bathroom, but he would kick the litter outside

01:57:22.280 --> 01:57:22.760
the box.

01:57:23.320 --> 01:57:25.640
So his dad's got sick of that.

01:57:25.640 --> 01:57:29.000
So they got him a covered litter box, but it won't fit in the bathroom.

01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:30.600
So we had to move it out here into it.

01:57:30.600 --> 01:57:33.000
So it's right on the, I guess you guys can't see it on Twitch.

01:57:33.000 --> 01:57:34.440
It's right on the other side of the wall.

01:57:34.440 --> 01:57:37.480
So when I heard the scratching, I was like, oh, he's, he's using the scratch post out

01:57:37.480 --> 01:57:37.560
there.

01:57:37.560 --> 01:57:40.920
And I'm like, what kind of ungodly noise is that?

01:57:40.920 --> 01:57:41.960
It's litter box.

01:57:41.960 --> 01:57:43.160
It does sound a little bit.

01:57:43.160 --> 01:57:43.320
Yeah.

01:57:43.320 --> 01:57:46.840
Cause my cat does the same thing, you know, it makes a lot more sense for she's in the

01:57:46.840 --> 01:57:47.240
garage.

01:57:47.240 --> 01:57:47.880
It's not a surprise.

01:57:47.880 --> 01:57:50.680
It's not getting picked up by the mics, but yeah, I started walking over there and looked

01:57:50.680 --> 01:57:54.520
over here and it's one of those litter boxes that he actually has to go inside.

01:57:54.520 --> 01:57:56.360
Cause like the, the roof has like a little cut out.

01:57:56.360 --> 01:57:58.440
And so I looked at, he's like peeking at me from up there.

01:57:58.440 --> 01:58:00.280
I'm like, oh, oh, sorry about that.

01:58:00.280 --> 01:58:01.320
Sorry about that.

01:58:01.320 --> 01:58:02.600
Didn't mean to walk in on you, Mr.

01:58:02.600 --> 01:58:02.920
Smoosh.

01:58:03.720 --> 01:58:10.200
Anyway, so yes, they've settled, they have settled and apparently are going to be supporting

01:58:10.200 --> 01:58:12.360
each other's endeavors as well.

01:58:12.360 --> 01:58:14.360
So, um, very cool.

01:58:14.920 --> 01:58:17.000
I'm looking forward to more star control games.

01:58:17.000 --> 01:58:18.840
I used to love a star control too.

01:58:20.360 --> 01:58:25.880
And then, um, we've got some news regarding, uh, moral combat 11.

01:58:25.880 --> 01:58:34.200
So they have a brand new update that is going to be, um, introducing new brutalities into

01:58:34.200 --> 01:58:35.560
the game as well.

01:58:35.560 --> 01:58:45.880
And also kind of, um, leading the way for some of the DLC, but yeah, so interesting

01:58:45.880 --> 01:58:52.680
that they had, like, apparently there's, um, a brutality for, uh, Cabal in the game where

01:58:52.680 --> 01:58:54.520
he scares the soul of the player.

01:58:55.160 --> 01:58:58.360
Um, that's a throwback to the classic from three.

01:58:58.360 --> 01:58:59.000
Yeah.

01:58:59.000 --> 01:59:02.840
Uh, they have a ton of different patch notes in here, but if you want to check it out,

01:59:02.840 --> 01:59:09.240
I'm sure they've got it on moral comments site, but yes, uh, lots of updates and, you

01:59:09.240 --> 01:59:10.920
know, balancing and stuff like that.

01:59:12.040 --> 01:59:12.920
So cool.

01:59:12.920 --> 01:59:17.400
Not really a big moral combat fan, but I am a fan of spawn, so I'll have to check that

01:59:17.400 --> 01:59:19.720
out when they have been playable and see what that's all about.

01:59:20.520 --> 01:59:22.120
Don't think it'll get me to buy the game though.

01:59:25.240 --> 01:59:25.720
All right.

01:59:25.720 --> 01:59:25.960
Yeah.

01:59:25.960 --> 01:59:30.120
I Alan's been playing a lot of mortal combat 11, but y'all know, I don't know.

01:59:30.120 --> 01:59:33.320
I like sometimes I'll kind of watch over, but you know, he does some weird thing.

01:59:33.320 --> 01:59:37.320
Maybe you guys know more about this than I do, but like he leaves it running.

01:59:37.320 --> 01:59:40.280
Like, like let's say we go out for food or something.

01:59:40.280 --> 01:59:44.120
He'll bring up moral combat 11 and he goes into the AI mode and he has the AI battle

01:59:44.120 --> 01:59:47.320
each other and he leaves that running while we go out for food, because I guess it's generating

01:59:47.320 --> 01:59:49.720
coins for the craft or something doing that.

01:59:49.720 --> 01:59:53.560
I didn't know that was the thing you could do, but that's, I guess, I don't know if it's

01:59:53.560 --> 01:59:57.240
an exploit or what you'd call that, but you think if it was unintended, they would have

01:59:57.240 --> 01:59:58.760
patched it out of the game by now, I think.

01:59:58.760 --> 02:00:00.360
But I thought that was kind of an interesting thing.

02:00:00.360 --> 02:00:02.440
So, all right.

02:00:04.840 --> 02:00:07.720
Let's move on and talk about some other quick stories.

02:00:07.720 --> 02:00:12.520
So last week we had the Microsoft press conference and y'all know, I was very excited about fantasy

02:00:12.520 --> 02:00:14.200
star online too.

02:00:14.200 --> 02:00:18.440
And some people were a little bit like, I don't want to get an X-Box and my PC isn't

02:00:18.440 --> 02:00:20.920
good enough to play fantasy star online too.

02:00:20.920 --> 02:00:21.880
Am I just screwed?

02:00:22.040 --> 02:00:24.920
And at the time it seemed like the answer was yes.

02:00:24.920 --> 02:00:31.640
However, apparently X-Box boss Phil Spencer confirmed to giant bomb in an interview that

02:00:31.640 --> 02:00:36.120
fantasy star online too, will end up on all platforms.

02:00:37.160 --> 02:00:41.000
Doesn't say necessarily it'd be the exact same time, but that they do plan to put PSO

02:00:41.000 --> 02:00:42.200
2 on all platforms.

02:00:42.200 --> 02:00:45.480
Yeah, at least they, I don't know, at least he brought that up.

02:00:45.480 --> 02:00:46.920
He didn't have to do that.

02:00:46.920 --> 02:00:47.880
Yeah, no, he didn't have to.

02:00:47.880 --> 02:00:50.920
And again, that's kind of one of those things where like Phil Spencer's a cool dad, you

02:00:50.920 --> 02:00:51.240
know what I mean?

02:00:51.240 --> 02:00:52.680
Which by the way, happy father's day, Loki.

02:00:52.680 --> 02:00:55.480
I should, I forgot to say that at the top of the show, it was up here and then I totally

02:00:55.480 --> 02:00:56.200
forgot to say anything.

02:00:56.200 --> 02:00:56.840
We got derailed.

02:00:56.840 --> 02:00:58.360
So happy father's day.

02:00:58.360 --> 02:01:00.280
Thank you to you and Phil Spencer.

02:01:00.280 --> 02:01:01.080
All right.

02:01:01.080 --> 02:01:05.320
It was just like any other day full of screaming, whining children and then migraines.

02:01:05.320 --> 02:01:06.760
They didn't do anything nice for you today?

02:01:07.800 --> 02:01:09.960
If by giving me a migraine was nice, then no.

02:01:09.960 --> 02:01:10.440
Okay.

02:01:10.440 --> 02:01:10.760
I'm sorry.

02:01:10.760 --> 02:01:11.480
That was fine.

02:01:12.120 --> 02:01:12.520
Whatever.

02:01:12.520 --> 02:01:17.400
I mean, my one son, he made me a little like dish thing.

02:01:17.400 --> 02:01:18.600
I don't really know what it is, but.

02:01:19.000 --> 02:01:23.880
Um, and then my other son, he made something for me, but he left it on the ground.

02:01:23.880 --> 02:01:28.440
And so I assume that that's my gift because it said happy father's day on it, but that's

02:01:28.440 --> 02:01:28.840
fine.

02:01:28.840 --> 02:01:29.720
I don't care.

02:01:29.720 --> 02:01:32.040
I mean, whatever.

02:01:32.040 --> 02:01:38.840
I, I just wish we had one day where they would just behave for like even a little bit, just,

02:01:38.840 --> 02:01:44.520
just for like, not until they're not like 10 minutes, you know, that would be just nice.

02:01:44.520 --> 02:01:46.920
But no, not this week.

02:01:46.920 --> 02:01:47.800
Not until they're 18.

02:01:48.360 --> 02:01:48.840
Anyway.

02:01:48.840 --> 02:01:51.480
Um, so why did they end up doing this?

02:01:51.480 --> 02:01:55.000
Uh, apparently Phil Spencer said simply, I wanted to do something with Sega.

02:01:55.000 --> 02:02:00.200
And, uh, this kind of helped, but they are indicating it could be a timed exclusive.

02:02:00.200 --> 02:02:03.400
So even though probably online too, we'll be coming to the other systems.

02:02:03.400 --> 02:02:04.840
It probably won't be right away.

02:02:04.840 --> 02:02:07.560
So it does seem like there is at least a timed exclusive agreement with that.

02:02:07.560 --> 02:02:12.200
So something to keep in mind, but, and as DJ Rama S is reminding me in chat, and I thought

02:02:12.200 --> 02:02:13.640
I mentioned it, but I'll mention it again.

02:02:13.640 --> 02:02:16.280
Uh, windows PC will also be an option to you.

02:02:16.280 --> 02:02:18.440
So if you do have a PC, that's good enough to play it.

02:02:18.440 --> 02:02:22.200
You don't necessarily have to run out and buy an X-Box just to just part of games pass.

02:02:22.920 --> 02:02:24.520
Um, well, it's going to be free to play.

02:02:24.520 --> 02:02:25.560
So, yeah.

02:02:25.560 --> 02:02:29.640
So it's just depends on how much of the, you know, in game stuff you want to pick up.

02:02:30.200 --> 02:02:35.080
Um, so one thing that was absent from E3, at least in the official press conference

02:02:35.080 --> 02:02:38.120
capacity and the direct was the Nintendo 3DS.

02:02:38.760 --> 02:02:41.720
It was, yeah, I have to admit, I kind of had a similar reaction.

02:02:41.720 --> 02:02:43.960
Look, don't misinterpret me.

02:02:43.960 --> 02:02:45.240
I love the 3DS.

02:02:45.240 --> 02:02:46.440
It's a great system.

02:02:46.440 --> 02:02:47.560
It's just time to move on.

02:02:47.560 --> 02:02:51.000
It's just time to move on to the Nintendo switch, which is a great portable system.

02:02:51.000 --> 02:02:53.400
But Nintendo does want to emphasize.

02:02:53.400 --> 02:02:55.160
The 3DS is not dead.

02:02:55.160 --> 02:02:58.920
Doug Bowser, the new president, which we, I think very clearly saw in that direct.

02:02:58.920 --> 02:03:01.640
We didn't talk about a little joke at the beginning, but it was silly.

02:03:01.640 --> 02:03:04.280
It was, where would you, Doug Bowser did a good job, right?

02:03:04.280 --> 02:03:04.680
I think he did fine.

02:03:04.680 --> 02:03:05.880
He's got some big shoes to fill.

02:03:05.880 --> 02:03:06.920
I think he did a fine job.

02:03:06.920 --> 02:03:08.520
It's hard to fill Reggie's shoes.

02:03:08.520 --> 02:03:08.840
It is.

02:03:08.840 --> 02:03:12.200
It's a very hard job, but I love, I like that they use the humor a little bit to kind of,

02:03:12.200 --> 02:03:13.880
you know, show that he's got a sense of humor.

02:03:13.960 --> 02:03:16.520
It's not just going to be some dry CEO taking over.

02:03:16.520 --> 02:03:18.760
I think it's a good thing, or excuse me, president taking over.

02:03:19.480 --> 02:03:24.840
Anyway, Doug Bowser did mention that the 3DS still has plenty of support from consumers

02:03:24.840 --> 02:03:25.640
in retail.

02:03:25.640 --> 02:03:30.200
So even though he said at this point, we have no games to announce on the 3DS at E3.

02:03:30.200 --> 02:03:34.680
In fact, we're not really showing 3DS content here because it's all about the Nintendo switch,

02:03:34.680 --> 02:03:37.880
but our 3DS business continues to do quite well.

02:03:37.880 --> 02:03:40.760
Retailers continue to support both the hardware and the software.

02:03:40.760 --> 02:03:45.240
And as long as there's consumer demand for 3DS, we'll continue to support it.

02:03:45.240 --> 02:03:49.720
In fact, we belay believe it's a great entry point for young gamers.

02:03:50.360 --> 02:03:54.760
So I imagine the 3DS will continue to be a third party supported.

02:03:54.760 --> 02:03:55.960
Like, I don't know.

02:03:55.960 --> 02:03:59.880
What's the modern equivalent of Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen go shopping and those types

02:03:59.880 --> 02:04:00.380
of games.

02:04:00.920 --> 02:04:05.320
Barbie, let's ride horse creator, pretty, you know, those types of things that are more

02:04:05.320 --> 02:04:06.120
geared to kids.

02:04:06.120 --> 02:04:07.480
What are like the modern equivalent of that?

02:04:07.480 --> 02:04:09.960
The modern equivalent of that, just like movie tie-in games.

02:04:10.040 --> 02:04:13.960
They've got one for like weird dolls or some odd dolls, or I don't know what the movie

02:04:13.960 --> 02:04:15.000
is adventure time.

02:04:15.000 --> 02:04:16.680
I would say adventure time games.

02:04:16.680 --> 02:04:19.320
But I'm like, I know of a lot of adults who get high adventure times.

02:04:19.320 --> 02:04:21.960
Not bad, but yeah.

02:04:21.960 --> 02:04:25.160
So things that, you know, are a little more aimed at kids, Nickelodeon games, I guess

02:04:25.160 --> 02:04:28.680
we'll leave it at that Nickelodeon games, you know, and that type of thing.

02:04:28.680 --> 02:04:32.760
So it seems like there might still be, but Nintendo themselves doesn't seem like they're

02:04:32.760 --> 02:04:34.760
looking to do anything official on the 3DS right now.

02:04:34.760 --> 02:04:38.440
So you will just have to play one of the hundreds of games that already exist for the 3DS.

02:04:38.440 --> 02:04:40.360
If you're looking for something like that.

02:04:40.360 --> 02:04:42.040
So, all right.

02:04:42.040 --> 02:04:46.760
Anyhow, a mistake theory in our chat at twitch.tv slash vog network says, Barbie, let's ride

02:04:46.760 --> 02:04:49.800
horse creator 3D remastered this fall on the PS4.

02:04:51.000 --> 02:04:55.400
Man, that was the one Xbox game I was hoping to see on Xbox one.

02:04:56.280 --> 02:04:56.680
Anyway.

02:04:59.800 --> 02:05:02.760
Dark Tetsuya says apparently one of the SpongeBob games is getting a remaster.

02:05:02.760 --> 02:05:03.480
Who would have thought?

02:05:03.480 --> 02:05:03.800
Yeah.

02:05:03.800 --> 02:05:04.200
Who would have?

02:05:04.200 --> 02:05:05.400
Battle for Bikini Bottom.

02:05:05.400 --> 02:05:06.120
Yeah.

02:05:06.120 --> 02:05:06.920
Okay.

02:05:06.920 --> 02:05:07.560
All right.

02:05:07.560 --> 02:05:08.200
Let's move on.

02:05:08.200 --> 02:05:11.000
Let's travel around the world and check out some games that are going to be releasing

02:05:11.000 --> 02:05:12.760
a little sooner than a SpongeBob remaster.

02:05:12.760 --> 02:05:17.240
As we check out world release date starting in the U S blaster master zero on PC this

02:05:17.240 --> 02:05:17.800
week.

02:05:17.800 --> 02:05:18.200
Cool.

02:05:18.200 --> 02:05:20.920
And I can't believe it, but we're at this point.

02:05:20.920 --> 02:05:26.840
Finally, bloodstain ritual of the night coming out on PC PlayStation for Xbox one.

02:05:28.200 --> 02:05:30.920
Not the switch because that's next week or the week after.

02:05:30.920 --> 02:05:35.640
Supposedly I'm getting a copy of that, but like I filled out that backer survey like

02:05:35.720 --> 02:05:36.920
three years ago.

02:05:36.920 --> 02:05:39.160
And I guess I'm still getting it.

02:05:39.160 --> 02:05:41.640
Like I don't, I don't think I get a physical copy.

02:05:41.640 --> 02:05:42.920
I think I get a digital copy.

02:05:42.920 --> 02:05:45.960
I feel like it was on PS4, but I moved it to the switch.

02:05:45.960 --> 02:05:47.000
I feel like that was the thing I did.

02:05:47.000 --> 02:05:51.640
Like, I don't even know you guys, this game I gave money to like six years ago.

02:05:51.640 --> 02:05:55.720
I finally get my, my, uh, my payback on that, I guess.

02:05:55.720 --> 02:05:58.360
But I might have to wait one more week if I did ask for the switch version.

02:05:58.360 --> 02:05:58.840
Yeah.

02:05:58.840 --> 02:06:04.920
There's a game called, uh, 19, eight X that's on PC and PlayStation four.

02:06:04.920 --> 02:06:12.120
My friend Pedro on the PC and switch, uh, super niche, Neptunia RPG on PC and Yakuza

02:06:12.120 --> 02:06:14.760
five on PlayStation four.

02:06:14.760 --> 02:06:16.680
And then actually I'm just checking real quick.

02:06:16.680 --> 02:06:17.880
See, this is part of the week.

02:06:17.880 --> 02:06:18.040
Yep.

02:06:18.040 --> 02:06:19.400
Apparently this is still part of the week.

02:06:19.400 --> 02:06:25.080
So we've got crash team racing nitro field on Nintendo switch PlayStation four and Xbox

02:06:25.080 --> 02:06:25.640
one.

02:06:25.640 --> 02:06:26.600
That's it.

02:06:26.600 --> 02:06:27.320
All right.

02:06:27.320 --> 02:06:31.480
Traveling over to Japan and checking out some of the releases on the PlayStation four to

02:06:31.480 --> 02:06:31.880
start.

02:06:31.880 --> 02:06:39.560
We have on June 20th from Sega Ryu Ga Gotoku five Yume Kanaishi mono remaster is coming

02:06:39.560 --> 02:06:40.200
out this week.

02:06:40.200 --> 02:06:41.400
That is a Sega game.

02:06:41.400 --> 02:06:42.360
Yakuza five.

02:06:42.360 --> 02:06:44.040
Is that, Oh, that's what is Yakuza five.

02:06:44.040 --> 02:06:46.040
Uh, yeah, of course, of course you just five.

02:06:46.040 --> 02:06:50.280
Uh, and then ease eight, uh, Lacrimosa of Dana is getting a price reduction.

02:06:50.280 --> 02:06:52.120
I was like, I thought that ease game was already out.

02:06:52.120 --> 02:06:52.280
Yeah.

02:06:52.280 --> 02:06:54.360
So that's just a price reduction that we get in Japan.

02:06:54.360 --> 02:06:58.120
Dead by daylight survivor edition, uh, gets a release in Japan.

02:06:58.120 --> 02:06:59.720
I think they probably already had dead by daylight.

02:06:59.720 --> 02:07:01.560
This is probably like a DLC type thing.

02:07:01.560 --> 02:07:06.040
And then, um, some new peripherals, like a new headset and things of that sort.

02:07:06.040 --> 02:07:10.120
So that's what you get on the PlayStation four on the Nintendo switch this week, a game

02:07:10.120 --> 02:07:11.640
called summer pockets.

02:07:11.640 --> 02:07:13.560
Oh, and this must be the big release this week.

02:07:13.560 --> 02:07:15.320
Yo-kai watch four.

02:07:15.320 --> 02:07:17.800
We're looking up at the same sky.

02:07:17.800 --> 02:07:19.960
I should point out that as a switch release.

02:07:19.960 --> 02:07:23.720
So speaking of the three DS kind of moving on from that, those Yo-kai watch games were

02:07:23.720 --> 02:07:25.320
all in the three DS previously.

02:07:25.320 --> 02:07:27.640
So this will be the first one that's on the switch.

02:07:27.640 --> 02:07:32.120
And I imagine, um, some people very much looking forward to that one kind of surprised

02:07:32.120 --> 02:07:34.920
that didn't make its way to a Nintendo direct here.

02:07:34.920 --> 02:07:36.760
Did those games just kind of flop here?

02:07:36.760 --> 02:07:38.760
I thought the first one at least did pretty well.

02:07:38.760 --> 02:07:39.320
I don't know.

02:07:39.320 --> 02:07:39.800
Huh?

02:07:39.800 --> 02:07:41.720
I wonder if they're still going to translate that here.

02:07:41.720 --> 02:07:42.520
I would think so.

02:07:42.520 --> 02:07:46.360
Especially, especially with the fact that the switch is doing pretty well, you would

02:07:46.360 --> 02:07:48.360
think so, but, uh, I guess we'll see.

02:07:48.920 --> 02:07:49.320
All right.

02:07:49.960 --> 02:07:55.000
Anyway, um, mistake theory and chat says the Yo-kai watch switch game looks beautiful.

02:07:55.000 --> 02:07:57.960
It puts the new Pokemon to shame visually at least.

02:07:57.960 --> 02:08:01.160
And Akuma JP is letting out a yes in the chat room.

02:08:01.160 --> 02:08:03.640
I know those, those games are much bigger in Japan than they are here.

02:08:03.640 --> 02:08:05.240
They tried to make it a thing here.

02:08:05.240 --> 02:08:08.840
Um, and I think that you would actually see the physical toys at Toys R Us.

02:08:08.840 --> 02:08:13.800
And they, you know, giving you an indication of how far back we got to go and Toys R Us

02:08:13.800 --> 02:08:17.080
was still around, but, um, you know, and that's more than I can say to most video games.

02:08:17.080 --> 02:08:20.600
So I think, you know, I think they hit a pretty good kid market with that, with that stuff.

02:08:20.600 --> 02:08:24.680
So anyway, um, how about Europe with dark Sakura having left the building?

02:08:24.920 --> 02:08:26.200
Loki, can you cover Europe?

02:08:26.200 --> 02:08:26.520
Yeah.

02:08:26.520 --> 02:08:30.200
So I mentioned this last week, but I guess it's been delayed a couple of days, but Leisure

02:08:30.200 --> 02:08:31.800
Suit Larry wet dreams don't dry.

02:08:31.800 --> 02:08:36.200
That's coming out on PlayStation four and Nintendo switch, uh, the Sims four Island

02:08:36.200 --> 02:08:38.120
living out on PC.

02:08:38.120 --> 02:08:41.720
That expansion there, uh, ever space stellar edition.

02:08:41.720 --> 02:08:44.680
That's coming out on PlayStation four.

02:08:44.680 --> 02:08:50.040
We've got a double pack of far cry five and far cry four that's on PlayStation four and

02:08:50.040 --> 02:08:54.040
Xbox one bloodstain ritual of the night coming out over there as well.

02:08:54.040 --> 02:09:00.360
PlayStation four, Xbox one and the switch, uh, Nippon marathon on PlayStation four and

02:09:00.360 --> 02:09:09.160
the switch, uh, Valfyria arc hero school story on Nintendo switch Rico on PlayStation four

02:09:09.160 --> 02:09:14.600
and Nintendo switch, uh, and crash team racing nitro fueled out on PlayStation four, Xbox

02:09:14.600 --> 02:09:15.640
one and Nintendo switch.

02:09:16.440 --> 02:09:20.600
Uh, pixel pockets in our chat says I hate the name of the newest Leisure Suit Larry

02:09:20.600 --> 02:09:21.240
so much.

02:09:22.120 --> 02:09:24.920
Well, yeah, they're, they're all pretty gross to be fair.

02:09:24.920 --> 02:09:30.760
It's, I guess kind of the point, but I, I kind of hear that name and I go, uh, okay.

02:09:30.760 --> 02:09:33.240
I make that same universal sound of disgust.

02:09:33.240 --> 02:09:35.240
Uh, anyway.

02:09:36.120 --> 02:09:36.840
All right.

02:09:36.840 --> 02:09:38.760
Uh, let's get to the mailbag, shall we?

02:09:38.760 --> 02:09:43.400
Uh, every week we invite you guys to email us, participate at orange lounge radio.com.

02:09:43.400 --> 02:09:45.560
And we read some of these emails here on the show.

02:09:46.120 --> 02:09:48.520
Uh, first email tonight from Garth Wolf.

02:09:48.520 --> 02:09:49.720
Hello, O L R.

02:09:49.720 --> 02:09:54.120
So I have to know has Julian, uh, which you guys don't know.

02:09:54.120 --> 02:09:57.000
Um, that is, uh, dark soccer is BFF Becky.

02:09:57.000 --> 02:10:01.480
Her kid is Julian and not the, not the animal crossing care we referenced earlier.

02:10:01.480 --> 02:10:01.980
Yes.

02:10:02.040 --> 02:10:03.240
Uh, different one.

02:10:03.240 --> 02:10:06.840
Um, but he's gotta be like 12 now, 13 almost.

02:10:06.840 --> 02:10:07.160
I don't know.

02:10:07.160 --> 02:10:08.120
He's, he's getting older.

02:10:08.120 --> 02:10:12.360
So anyway, uh, the question is, has Julian heard Carly Rae Jepsen's new album?

02:10:12.360 --> 02:10:14.760
Is he absolutely living for track one?

02:10:15.480 --> 02:10:17.320
Let me translate to heterosexual.

02:10:17.320 --> 02:10:17.820
Okay.

02:10:19.240 --> 02:10:23.160
Track one on Carly Rae Jepsen's new album is called Julian.

02:10:23.160 --> 02:10:25.160
And it's a bop as the kids would say.

02:10:25.160 --> 02:10:26.920
So it's a, it's a fun little song.

02:10:26.920 --> 02:10:29.560
So the question is, has Julian heard the song Julian?

02:10:29.560 --> 02:10:30.440
We don't know.

02:10:30.440 --> 02:10:33.800
Um, but we will pass that question along to Becky and get back to you.

02:10:33.800 --> 02:10:38.120
But now I want to know, since we brought up earlier in the show that there is an animal

02:10:38.120 --> 02:10:40.040
crossing character named Julian.

02:10:40.040 --> 02:10:43.240
What I want to know is, does Julian know about Julian and animal crossing?

02:10:43.240 --> 02:10:47.320
And do they listen to Julian by Carly Rae Jepsen while they play animal crossing?

02:10:47.320 --> 02:10:49.480
We'll ask these hard hitting questions and get back to you.

02:10:50.120 --> 02:10:51.640
All right, moving on.

02:10:53.000 --> 02:10:56.120
One more email here from Frodo Swagons.

02:10:57.000 --> 02:11:01.480
Again, and if you want to email us for a future week, participate at orangeloungeradio.com.

02:11:01.480 --> 02:11:03.560
Hey, OLR Frodo Swagons here.

02:11:03.560 --> 02:11:07.000
So I've really been having an itch to play at MMO lately.

02:11:07.000 --> 02:11:09.720
I was thinking about getting into Elder Scrolls online.

02:11:09.720 --> 02:11:12.440
I was doing some research and I guess with all the expansions,

02:11:12.440 --> 02:11:14.440
some are saying that the game is in its prime.

02:11:14.440 --> 02:11:16.040
I played the heck out of Skyrim.

02:11:16.040 --> 02:11:17.720
So I think this might be up my alley.

02:11:17.720 --> 02:11:19.880
Do any of you have any experience with ESO?

02:11:20.520 --> 02:11:24.920
Also beyond ESO, are there any MMOs you could recommend me trying out?

02:11:24.920 --> 02:11:27.480
And that is again from Frodo Swagons.

02:11:27.480 --> 02:11:29.240
I have played a little bit of ESO.

02:11:29.240 --> 02:11:32.280
I will admit my experience when I played it was not great,

02:11:32.280 --> 02:11:35.160
but I think it's because I played it the week that it went.

02:11:35.160 --> 02:11:39.240
It's not free to play, but it lost the subscription fee on PlayStation four.

02:11:39.240 --> 02:11:41.000
It went for like the Guild Wars model.

02:11:41.000 --> 02:11:41.240
Yeah.

02:11:41.240 --> 02:11:43.800
Once you buy the game, then you pretty much like own it.

02:11:43.800 --> 02:11:47.000
I only played it in beta and I just, I was expecting Skyrim.

02:11:47.000 --> 02:11:47.800
I didn't get Skyrim.

02:11:47.800 --> 02:11:48.760
So I was like, meh.

02:11:48.760 --> 02:11:49.960
So I think that's important to know.

02:11:49.960 --> 02:11:51.480
ESO is not Skyrim.

02:11:51.480 --> 02:11:57.720
But that being said, the people that are into it that I know really seem to be into it.

02:11:57.720 --> 02:12:01.480
So it's worth checking out if you like Skyrim.

02:12:01.480 --> 02:12:06.120
There is no monthly fee, which, you know, obviously the big MMO players right now,

02:12:06.120 --> 02:12:09.720
World of Warcraft and Final Fantasy 14, they do have monthly fees.

02:12:09.720 --> 02:12:13.400
But otherwise there's a lot out there that's either buy once

02:12:13.400 --> 02:12:15.000
or just straight up free to play.

02:12:15.000 --> 02:12:15.480
Right.

02:12:15.480 --> 02:12:16.520
Guild Wars 2.

02:12:16.520 --> 02:12:18.040
Guild Wars 2 is a buy once.

02:12:18.040 --> 02:12:20.520
Star Trek Online is free to play.

02:12:20.520 --> 02:12:23.400
I don't know if you're, I don't know, like what your tastes are completely.

02:12:23.400 --> 02:12:25.880
I mean, you like Skyrim, but if sci-fi is up your alley,

02:12:25.880 --> 02:12:28.520
I played Star Trek Online for a hot minute and I thought it was pretty fun.

02:12:28.520 --> 02:12:29.640
And that was way back in the beginning.

02:12:29.640 --> 02:12:32.760
I kind of want to, you know, so many games, so little time, right?

02:12:32.760 --> 02:12:33.320
Yeah.

02:12:33.320 --> 02:12:33.640
Yeah.

02:12:33.640 --> 02:12:36.360
Same DC Universe was another one like that.

02:12:36.360 --> 02:12:37.480
That played like going.

02:12:37.480 --> 02:12:39.240
I think so that played like a beat them up.

02:12:39.240 --> 02:12:40.920
And that, uh, that was, that was fun.

02:12:41.480 --> 02:12:46.520
Um, I, you know, my answer, I'm going to encourage you to check out Final Fantasy 14.

02:12:46.520 --> 02:12:48.200
I think it's great, but it does have a month.

02:12:48.200 --> 02:12:50.760
World of Warcraft has like the starter thing, doesn't it?

02:12:50.760 --> 02:12:51.000
Yeah.

02:12:51.000 --> 02:12:54.120
You know, and, uh, both those games do have a starter edition.

02:12:54.120 --> 02:12:55.880
So I think that's worth checking out.

02:12:55.880 --> 02:12:58.520
Uh, if you want to, you can just roll free to play.

02:12:58.520 --> 02:13:01.000
You can level a character up to like 35.

02:13:01.000 --> 02:13:06.280
You're limited on like how much gold you can have and who you can send tells to and stuff

02:13:06.280 --> 02:13:11.560
because they don't want gold spammers, just roll, rolling unlimited free accounts.

02:13:11.560 --> 02:13:13.080
That's why there's so many restrictions.

02:13:13.080 --> 02:13:17.240
It's not just to like convince you to buy the game, but they, they have to be careful

02:13:17.240 --> 02:13:20.760
about some of those gold spammers and things like that being, uh, have easy access to make

02:13:20.760 --> 02:13:21.320
a new account.

02:13:21.320 --> 02:13:24.920
So, but I would definitely say download the trial edition of Final Fantasy 14.

02:13:24.920 --> 02:13:28.760
It's available on PlayStation 4 as well as PC or World of Warcraft.

02:13:28.760 --> 02:13:31.720
If you want, if you want to try the behemoth granddaddy of them all.

02:13:32.360 --> 02:13:34.120
World of Warcraft does have a starter edition.

02:13:34.120 --> 02:13:35.080
You can check out as well.

02:13:35.720 --> 02:13:38.040
And right here at the boys geeks network, you know, girls gone.

02:13:38.040 --> 02:13:38.360
Wow.

02:13:38.360 --> 02:13:42.440
Is still going strong and they're still into the game and they talk about it still every

02:13:42.440 --> 02:13:43.080
week rating.

02:13:43.080 --> 02:13:46.760
I know they're still rating and doing progression because I know they've been jumping into that

02:13:46.760 --> 02:13:48.440
classic edition or whatever it is.

02:13:48.440 --> 02:13:49.080
Vanilla.

02:13:49.080 --> 02:13:52.760
I don't know if they've done, I feel like they did do like an episode on it, but until

02:13:52.760 --> 02:13:55.880
that's here, I don't know if it's not out yet.

02:13:56.680 --> 02:13:59.720
Um, but that's also not something I'm anticipating is going to be free to play.

02:13:59.720 --> 02:14:02.120
So it's a little bit outside with this question about, yeah.

02:14:02.120 --> 02:14:04.760
But, um, that will be a thing at some point as well.

02:14:04.760 --> 02:14:07.640
So, um, other comments in chat.

02:14:07.640 --> 02:14:10.840
So quest buster, our chatters want to have their say as well.

02:14:10.840 --> 02:14:13.800
Um, actually, let me start with this comment because you just says, if you want to play

02:14:13.800 --> 02:14:15.400
an MMO, just play Minecraft.

02:14:15.400 --> 02:14:18.440
MMOs are a waste of money, but some of my memos are free to play.

02:14:18.440 --> 02:14:20.040
So you can't really say they're a waste of money.

02:14:20.040 --> 02:14:24.840
Like some, you know, just go into, um, something like steam and just look up free to play.

02:14:24.840 --> 02:14:29.160
And there's a lot of MMOs in there, uh, especially a lot of the stuff that comes over from Korea.

02:14:29.240 --> 02:14:35.320
Um, what's the one, sorry, Apple watch.

02:14:35.320 --> 02:14:36.040
Can't answer that.

02:14:36.040 --> 02:14:36.360
Wow.

02:14:36.360 --> 02:14:40.120
My Apple watch is like suddenly turned on Skynet has possessed my watch.

02:14:40.120 --> 02:14:41.160
Um, anyway, what's that?

02:14:41.160 --> 02:14:46.520
What's that one in Korea that, um, the guys, it has an affiliation with DJ max and has

02:14:46.520 --> 02:14:48.120
that song, but I don't know.

02:14:48.120 --> 02:14:48.840
Sword art.

02:14:48.840 --> 02:14:49.400
Is that it?

02:14:49.400 --> 02:14:49.720
I don't know.

02:14:49.720 --> 02:14:50.600
Anyway.

02:14:50.600 --> 02:14:52.440
Um, Oh, path of exile.

02:14:52.440 --> 02:14:53.560
Pixel pockets calls out.

02:14:53.560 --> 02:14:54.600
That's not really an MMO.

02:14:54.600 --> 02:14:57.240
It's more like a Diablo game, but it's free and it's on all the consoles.

02:14:57.240 --> 02:14:58.280
That's for sure.

02:14:58.280 --> 02:15:01.400
Um, let's see Questbuster does warn careful with the Korean stuff.

02:15:01.400 --> 02:15:04.040
A lot of the big Korean MMOs are massive grind fests.

02:15:04.040 --> 02:15:04.920
Uh, bless.

02:15:04.920 --> 02:15:05.800
That was the name of it.

02:15:05.800 --> 02:15:06.920
Thank you, Shane.

02:15:06.920 --> 02:15:12.680
Um, Questbuster also says ESO just released a new expansion to called elsewhere.

02:15:12.680 --> 02:15:13.720
I hope I said that right.

02:15:13.720 --> 02:15:16.920
Homeland of the Khajiit and introduces a new necromancer class.

02:15:16.920 --> 02:15:18.360
I've also heard the same as Rob.

02:15:18.360 --> 02:15:19.800
People that are playing it seem to like it.

02:15:19.800 --> 02:15:24.920
And if it's come a long way since this rough beta days, uh, and then also brings up the

02:15:24.920 --> 02:15:25.880
Diablo light games.

02:15:25.880 --> 02:15:28.120
Questbuster says there's also warframe.

02:15:28.120 --> 02:15:33.000
If you want something more sci-fi, uh, dark Tetsuya says I should bring up the final fantasy

02:15:33.000 --> 02:15:35.240
14 vanilla thing that was on Twitter.

02:15:35.240 --> 02:15:39.160
I wish I had the video ready to go, but I retweeted it on my personal account at Rob

02:15:39.160 --> 02:15:39.880
Roberts.

02:15:39.880 --> 02:15:45.080
So somebody in an E3 interview or something asked the question of Yoshi P that it didn't

02:15:45.080 --> 02:15:50.040
say because of world of Warcraft of vanilla, but basically was saying since it's been so

02:15:50.040 --> 02:15:54.840
many years, since 1.0, have you ever thought about releasing 1.0 and a version of that

02:15:54.840 --> 02:15:59.240
that people can experience and Yoshi P, he understands enough English where he just starts

02:15:59.240 --> 02:16:01.800
busting up laughing as the question is being asked.

02:16:01.800 --> 02:16:05.640
And then, um, so the translator starts to go and say the thing.

02:16:05.640 --> 02:16:10.280
And then the translator hands the mic over and he just looks at it and he goes nightmare.

02:16:14.840 --> 02:16:17.800
And then everybody laughs because it's true nightmare.

02:16:17.800 --> 02:16:22.360
And, uh, one thing that's also born world of Warcraft vanilla was kind of good for its

02:16:22.360 --> 02:16:23.080
time.

02:16:23.080 --> 02:16:31.720
Final fantasy 4T 1.0, although I guess towards the end of its run, it had some, it had some,

02:16:31.720 --> 02:16:33.880
some inklings of the game that was to come.

02:16:33.880 --> 02:16:37.960
And I think people remember it a little more fondly in its final form, but honestly, guys,

02:16:37.960 --> 02:16:41.320
let them use the resources to keep reinventing the game.

02:16:41.320 --> 02:16:43.240
I think shadowbringers is going to be a lot of fun.

02:16:43.240 --> 02:16:46.200
I'm really looking forward to still holding out for my 11 remaster.

02:16:46.200 --> 02:16:46.700
Yeah.

02:16:47.640 --> 02:16:48.140
Right.

02:16:48.520 --> 02:16:49.480
Someday.

02:16:49.480 --> 02:16:50.120
All right.

02:16:50.120 --> 02:16:54.760
Um, Frodo swaggins says, I noticed you just met some Skynet.

02:16:54.760 --> 02:16:58.200
I don't know much about it besides they just launched a bunch of satellites and it's supposed

02:16:58.200 --> 02:16:59.960
to give people internet worldwide.

02:16:59.960 --> 02:17:02.280
Do you think that will have an impact on the gaming industry?

02:17:02.280 --> 02:17:05.640
Well, the reason why I say Skynet is watch a movie called Terminator 2.

02:17:05.640 --> 02:17:09.000
And it looks like, I'll explain why I said that right kids today.

02:17:10.760 --> 02:17:13.560
Think of, do you know what year Terminator 2 came out?

02:17:13.560 --> 02:17:15.160
It was a long time ago, Loki.

02:17:15.160 --> 02:17:15.800
It's very possible.

02:17:15.800 --> 02:17:18.600
There's been several Terminator movies that have come out since then.

02:17:18.600 --> 02:17:20.840
They have covered Skynet within the last like 10 years.

02:17:20.840 --> 02:17:22.280
Are they worth watching Loki?

02:17:23.560 --> 02:17:24.520
That's what I thought.

02:17:24.520 --> 02:17:25.020
All right.

02:17:25.960 --> 02:17:28.760
The new one is, I mean, I don't know.

02:17:31.240 --> 02:17:34.840
But to take the other part of the question seriously, do you think that'll have an impact

02:17:34.840 --> 02:17:35.800
on the gaming industry?

02:17:35.800 --> 02:17:36.120
Sure.

02:17:36.120 --> 02:17:40.920
If people have internet worldwide, then things like Stadia, you can take a lot more seriously

02:17:40.920 --> 02:17:42.840
as really being able to impact the industry.

02:17:42.840 --> 02:17:45.960
And I think the more accessible the internet becomes, I think that's just going to be a

02:17:45.960 --> 02:17:50.680
better thing just in general for being able to communicate and learn from cultures and

02:17:50.680 --> 02:17:51.400
learn from other people.

02:17:51.400 --> 02:17:52.840
I think that's just going to be a good thing.

02:17:52.840 --> 02:17:56.040
And gaming is just one part of that.

02:17:56.040 --> 02:17:59.160
And Bobby does say, you're thinking of Starlink and not Skynet.

02:17:59.160 --> 02:18:00.840
Skynet is a movie reference.

02:18:00.840 --> 02:18:01.340
You know what?

02:18:02.120 --> 02:18:04.520
I get stuff mixed up all the time.

02:18:04.520 --> 02:18:06.520
And Starlink, we're just having fun.

02:18:06.520 --> 02:18:10.920
And Starlink is a failed toys to life game that had Starfox in it.

02:18:10.920 --> 02:18:11.420
All right.

02:18:11.960 --> 02:18:13.800
Anyway, that was it for our emails tonight.

02:18:13.800 --> 02:18:18.600
Participate at OrangeLoungeTrady.com is the place to send us emails if you have something

02:18:18.600 --> 02:18:20.520
you'd like to ask about in the future.

02:18:21.080 --> 02:18:24.760
We do have a few more stories, things that happened this week that don't necessarily

02:18:24.760 --> 02:18:26.520
relate to the press conferences.

02:18:26.520 --> 02:18:32.200
In fact, one story that they would probably rather that wasn't reported on this week,

02:18:32.200 --> 02:18:33.000
right, Loki?

02:18:33.000 --> 02:18:33.500
Yes.

02:18:34.120 --> 02:18:38.760
So there's been layoffs or potential layoffs with Amazon Game Studios.

02:18:38.760 --> 02:18:44.920
So apparently they are going to be shifting some of the employees or trying to shift some

02:18:44.920 --> 02:18:46.920
of the employees to other positions.

02:18:46.920 --> 02:18:51.240
But if those employees don't find other positions, they're just going to be let go.

02:18:51.800 --> 02:18:56.520
So Amazon Game Studios, they're reorganizing some of the teams to allow us to prioritize

02:18:56.520 --> 02:19:02.040
development of New World and Crucible and new unannounced projects we're excited to

02:19:02.040 --> 02:19:03.160
reveal in the future.

02:19:03.880 --> 02:19:09.160
These moves are a result of regular business planning cycles where we align resources to

02:19:09.160 --> 02:19:11.560
match evolving long range priorities.

02:19:11.560 --> 02:19:15.640
We are working closely with the employees affected by these changes to assist in finding

02:19:15.640 --> 02:19:17.160
new roles within Amazon.

02:19:17.160 --> 02:19:23.640
Amazon is deeply committed to the games and continues to invest heavily in Amazon Game

02:19:23.640 --> 02:19:30.680
Studios, Twitch, Twitch Prime, AWS, and our retail businesses, as well as other areas

02:19:30.680 --> 02:19:31.720
within Amazon.

02:19:32.680 --> 02:19:39.400
So it sounds like kind of like what we had with Blizzard, where they're just kind of

02:19:39.400 --> 02:19:43.480
looking at what's going to be coming in the pipeline and adjusting staff accordingly.

02:19:43.480 --> 02:19:46.600
And then we also heard about that they canceled a project, too, although I guess most of the

02:19:46.600 --> 02:19:48.200
programmers moved to other stuff.

02:19:48.200 --> 02:19:50.680
But maybe, well, we don't know what the project was.

02:19:50.680 --> 02:19:54.200
It could be, well, the start of the whole Starcraft Ghost, quote unquote thing.

02:19:54.200 --> 02:19:55.560
Oh, you mean in this case with Amazon?

02:19:55.560 --> 02:19:56.200
Yeah, yeah.

02:19:56.200 --> 02:19:58.680
Well, I mean, we know Amazon's got that big MMO.

02:19:59.640 --> 02:20:00.360
Honestly, I forgot.

02:20:00.360 --> 02:20:01.720
Of which I completely forgot it.

02:20:01.720 --> 02:20:02.200
Exactly.

02:20:02.200 --> 02:20:02.600
Me, too.

02:20:02.600 --> 02:20:07.000
I hate to say it, but I kind of forgot that that was all a thing until this news about

02:20:07.000 --> 02:20:07.640
the layoffs came out.

02:20:07.640 --> 02:20:11.800
And then I'm like, oh, yeah, Amazon was working on that next big MMO.

02:20:11.800 --> 02:20:16.280
Speaking of one of the previous emails we just had, this next big MMO that they really

02:20:16.280 --> 02:20:17.000
want people to check out.

02:20:17.000 --> 02:20:21.080
And I remember we got a little bit of information on it, but here we are, E3, and Amazon hasn't

02:20:21.080 --> 02:20:21.720
said anything.

02:20:23.240 --> 02:20:25.400
They said that this layoff does not affect that game.

02:20:25.400 --> 02:20:26.920
They are working on these games still.

02:20:26.920 --> 02:20:29.320
It's not that these have been canceled by any means.

02:20:29.320 --> 02:20:31.320
It's other stuff that we hadn't heard about yet.

02:20:31.320 --> 02:20:31.880
Yeah.

02:20:31.880 --> 02:20:33.240
So interesting.

02:20:36.360 --> 02:20:38.040
New World is the name of that MMO.

02:20:38.040 --> 02:20:39.400
Thank you, Quest Buster.

02:20:39.400 --> 02:20:41.800
It had a closed beta earlier this year and then nothing.

02:20:41.800 --> 02:20:43.880
Oh, I didn't even realize it had a closed beta.

02:20:43.880 --> 02:20:45.320
So you would think it's getting close.

02:20:45.320 --> 02:20:48.280
I wonder if Amazon's going to say some more on that.

02:20:48.280 --> 02:20:51.400
Well, our thoughts to those that were affected by the layoff.

02:20:51.400 --> 02:20:55.160
It does sound like at least Amazon's being pretty decent about they gave them notice,

02:20:55.160 --> 02:20:59.640
so they have time to relocate within Amazon and start to look for other work.

02:20:59.640 --> 02:21:03.640
So it wasn't just like they brought them in and said, bye, your insurance is canceled

02:21:03.640 --> 02:21:04.040
tomorrow.

02:21:04.600 --> 02:21:10.360
It sounds like at least for all there's a lot worse ways this could have been handled

02:21:10.360 --> 02:21:13.640
telltale, but it sounds like this one went all right.

02:21:13.640 --> 02:21:14.140
Yeah.

02:21:14.600 --> 02:21:20.600
For as crappy of a situation as it is, it's at least a little bit more of a ramp down

02:21:20.600 --> 02:21:22.520
instead of just a drop off a cliff.

02:21:22.520 --> 02:21:23.560
Yeah, I mean, yeah.

02:21:23.560 --> 02:21:24.680
So all right.

02:21:26.200 --> 02:21:28.040
Anyhow, let's move on.

02:21:28.040 --> 02:21:32.200
Oh, this is kind of interesting about, you know, we love our games.

02:21:32.200 --> 02:21:32.840
At least I do.

02:21:32.840 --> 02:21:35.320
I play just a little bit of Ingress and Pokemon.

02:21:35.320 --> 02:21:41.400
I still I don't know if you saw the coverage of like Minecraft Earth in E3, but they know

02:21:41.400 --> 02:21:42.360
I didn't see any of it.

02:21:42.360 --> 02:21:45.320
They were shown like different outlets were showing some of the stuff.

02:21:45.320 --> 02:21:46.760
I really want to play the game.

02:21:46.760 --> 02:21:47.400
Yeah, let's cool.

02:21:47.400 --> 02:21:51.320
No, I'm I'm pretty much just like what people don't realize as much as people like to tease

02:21:51.320 --> 02:21:54.040
me for playing a lot of Ingress and playing a lot of Pokemon go.

02:21:54.040 --> 02:22:01.000
And rumor, rumor, big are you is that America is getting Harry Potter Wizards Unite this

02:22:01.000 --> 02:22:04.120
week that there's a big event on Tuesday and it's going to launch in America.

02:22:04.120 --> 02:22:09.080
And if that's the case, I apologize to all my Ingress friends, but I'm going to be taking

02:22:09.080 --> 02:22:11.000
that over and split it in the four now.

02:22:11.000 --> 02:22:11.880
Look, here's the thing.

02:22:11.880 --> 02:22:12.840
Here's the thing.

02:22:12.840 --> 02:22:15.080
I'm max level and then summon Ingress.

02:22:15.080 --> 02:22:16.760
So the whole recursion thing, right?

02:22:16.760 --> 02:22:19.080
I've looped through the game and I'm back on level 12.

02:22:19.080 --> 02:22:19.880
I've lapped.

02:22:19.960 --> 02:22:22.760
So which so which house are you going to be?

02:22:22.760 --> 02:22:24.440
You don't I don't think you don't pick out.

02:22:24.440 --> 02:22:25.800
No, it's not PvP.

02:22:25.800 --> 02:22:27.480
It's it's like a PvE game.

02:22:28.040 --> 02:22:30.680
So I think still though, I think you still do get to get Slytherin.

02:22:30.680 --> 02:22:31.640
Of course, I'm picking Slytherin.

02:22:31.640 --> 02:22:33.560
That's not even because of green, but in part.

02:22:33.560 --> 02:22:35.000
But yes, Slytherin for sure.

02:22:35.000 --> 02:22:36.600
Um, if that's an option.

02:22:36.600 --> 02:22:37.320
But here's the thing.

02:22:37.320 --> 02:22:39.240
I'm max level in Ingress.

02:22:39.240 --> 02:22:40.680
I'm max level in Pokemon go.

02:22:40.680 --> 02:22:44.200
I'm I'm just about to hit 30 million XP cumulative.

02:22:44.200 --> 02:22:46.840
So 20 million is when you hit level 40.

02:22:46.840 --> 02:22:47.880
So that'll tell you how much.

02:22:48.520 --> 02:22:51.080
And I don't even play as much Pokemon go as I was.

02:22:51.080 --> 02:22:52.360
I caught two shiny stars.

02:22:52.360 --> 02:22:55.640
I stopped carrying my gotcha with me because I just

02:22:56.360 --> 02:22:58.280
I have trouble setting it up in the car sometimes.

02:22:58.280 --> 02:22:59.640
It runs the battery down way too fast.

02:22:59.640 --> 02:23:03.720
It's just, um, I just don't care enough anymore.

02:23:03.720 --> 02:23:06.200
I'm like, eh, I miss my bonus.

02:23:06.200 --> 02:23:07.240
Yeah, whatever.

02:23:07.240 --> 02:23:08.600
I'll play it sometimes.

02:23:08.600 --> 02:23:10.680
But like I didn't really play this weekend either.

02:23:10.680 --> 02:23:11.000
Yeah.

02:23:11.000 --> 02:23:13.800
Again, and everybody's going like, oh shit in chat.

02:23:13.800 --> 02:23:15.000
Rumor, big rumor.

02:23:15.000 --> 02:23:18.520
But there was something about because tangent time

02:23:18.520 --> 02:23:20.920
before we get to the topic that's actually in the sidebar.

02:23:21.480 --> 02:23:27.080
So, um, apparently Niantic sued these guys that were making a game

02:23:27.080 --> 02:23:30.280
called like Ingress plus plus and Pokemon go plus plus

02:23:30.280 --> 02:23:35.000
that basically had extra utilities and spoofing abilities built into the apps.

02:23:35.000 --> 02:23:39.160
And they were saying, and I, these people that were making the apps

02:23:39.160 --> 02:23:41.800
were saying that they were building it for people who can't,

02:23:42.360 --> 02:23:46.680
who are due to a disability or whatever, can't go out in the real world and play.

02:23:46.680 --> 02:23:53.080
And I'm kind of like, in the real world, there are lots of disability accessible spots.

02:23:53.080 --> 02:23:56.600
And I kind of think that's like a misdirect to make people feel bad

02:23:56.600 --> 02:23:59.240
about what they're really doing, which is the spoofing.

02:23:59.240 --> 02:24:03.560
I, the spoofing is out of control in a lot of these AR games.

02:24:03.560 --> 02:24:04.440
And it needs to be dealt with.

02:24:04.440 --> 02:24:07.800
And so I applaud Niantic for suing this company and they had, they shut down.

02:24:07.800 --> 02:24:08.600
They're gone now.

02:24:08.600 --> 02:24:12.200
The next day they were basically like our legal team has told that, you know,

02:24:12.200 --> 02:24:13.800
they're like, we're going to get sued into oblivion.

02:24:13.800 --> 02:24:15.400
We have shut down basically.

02:24:15.400 --> 02:24:17.000
So that all happened.

02:24:17.000 --> 02:24:22.840
And the question about why now is apparently this company already had,

02:24:22.840 --> 02:24:26.440
because the Harry Potter game is already out in Australia, New Zealand.

02:24:26.440 --> 02:24:27.480
It's been testing there.

02:24:27.480 --> 02:24:31.960
Apparently this company already had its wizard unite plus plus ready to go.

02:24:31.960 --> 02:24:34.920
And so the reason why Niantic did this when they did this is because

02:24:34.920 --> 02:24:38.280
rumor they're doing wizard unite this week in the U S and they

02:24:38.280 --> 02:24:41.080
wanted to get out in front of the cheater train.

02:24:41.080 --> 02:24:42.440
So that way, when the game launches,

02:24:42.440 --> 02:24:44.360
it's not rampant with cheaters in the beginning of the game.

02:24:45.560 --> 02:24:46.360
Interesting, right?

02:24:46.360 --> 02:24:48.440
I'm just glad Niantic's doing something about it.

02:24:48.440 --> 02:24:51.640
So, um, where was I before I got into all that?

02:24:51.640 --> 02:24:52.360
I don't even know.

02:24:52.360 --> 02:24:54.440
So other AR games.

02:24:54.440 --> 02:24:54.680
Yeah.

02:24:54.680 --> 02:24:56.760
SSG, SSG 100 Matt in chat says,

02:24:56.760 --> 02:24:59.320
Ugh, I hate it when spoofers use that as an excuse.

02:24:59.320 --> 02:25:00.120
I do too.

02:25:00.120 --> 02:25:04.440
Like, you know what you're really doing, please, you know?

02:25:04.440 --> 02:25:05.160
And I, yeah.

02:25:05.160 --> 02:25:06.840
And SSG 100 Matt says, don't get me wrong.

02:25:06.840 --> 02:25:09.000
I believe there are people with disabilities that can't play.

02:25:09.000 --> 02:25:11.880
And it does suck that they can't play, but spoofers use this.

02:25:11.880 --> 02:25:14.600
And I would be all for something maybe to make, you know,

02:25:14.600 --> 02:25:17.800
maybe the ball throwing more accessible to somebody or, you know,

02:25:17.800 --> 02:25:19.720
making some tweaks doing, you know,

02:25:19.720 --> 02:25:21.640
different types of things that we can do within the game.

02:25:21.640 --> 02:25:26.360
But I, I think you still need to be able to go out in the real world and,

02:25:26.360 --> 02:25:27.160
you know, play.

02:25:27.160 --> 02:25:30.280
And, um, yeah, I think that's, that's what it is for me.

02:25:30.920 --> 02:25:31.240
All right.

02:25:31.960 --> 02:25:36.200
Anyhow, going on to other AR games that have nothing to do with Niantic's

02:25:36.200 --> 02:25:38.360
wheelhouse, but we got on that tangent anyway.

02:25:38.360 --> 02:25:40.760
So Netflix announced some other games as well.

02:25:40.760 --> 02:25:42.840
Some stranger things based games.

02:25:42.840 --> 02:25:45.640
Apparently there's like a Fortnite stranger things collaboration happening.

02:25:45.640 --> 02:25:48.280
I had no idea that was a thing, but of course it's a thing because Fortnite.

02:25:48.280 --> 02:25:49.640
They collaborated with everything.

02:25:49.640 --> 02:25:50.600
Yeah, why not?

02:25:50.600 --> 02:25:55.720
But, um, apparently there is a Pokemon go style, but see when the media calls

02:25:55.720 --> 02:25:58.760
it that I go, it doesn't mean that you're going to like throw a ball and

02:25:58.760 --> 02:26:01.240
catch, you know, Demi Gorgon.

02:26:01.240 --> 02:26:04.280
And yeah, I don't think it's going to be like Tessa Hydra,

02:26:04.280 --> 02:26:08.040
but it's a location based game called stranger things, mobile game

02:26:08.040 --> 02:26:09.720
for Android and iOS.

02:26:09.720 --> 02:26:12.200
And of course it revolves around the upside down.

02:26:12.200 --> 02:26:16.040
Now that part I get is that like, Oh, so like, depending on where you are

02:26:16.040 --> 02:26:19.160
on the phone, you're in the upside down, I would think is the logical,

02:26:19.160 --> 02:26:20.440
Oh, that's how it's going to work.

02:26:20.440 --> 02:26:23.000
So maybe you do battle the Demi Gorgons and all this stuff,

02:26:23.000 --> 02:26:25.240
but where they're at is kind of a real world.

02:26:25.240 --> 02:26:25.560
I don't know.

02:26:25.560 --> 02:26:25.960
We'll see.

02:26:25.960 --> 02:26:26.600
We'll see.

02:26:26.600 --> 02:26:30.040
Um, but anyway, the game revolves around the upside down and it's all hidden

02:26:30.040 --> 02:26:31.960
all around you and what you do day to day.

02:26:31.960 --> 02:26:35.400
And you have to work together with friends to overcome the evils that

02:26:35.400 --> 02:26:36.760
are escaping from the upside down.

02:26:36.760 --> 02:26:37.960
It's due next year.

02:26:37.960 --> 02:26:41.880
It's being made by next games who made our world, which is the walking

02:26:41.880 --> 02:26:45.640
dead location game, which is like one of the few that I haven't played.

02:26:45.640 --> 02:26:47.480
Cause I'm just not super into the walking dead.

02:26:47.480 --> 02:26:49.560
Cause I'm just not super into zombie stuff.

02:26:49.560 --> 02:26:52.440
Um, anymore like the old stuff's fine.

02:26:52.440 --> 02:26:55.240
But anyway, um, there's also another game that's coming out called

02:26:55.240 --> 02:26:58.600
stranger three things, three, the game, uh, that ties into the third

02:26:58.600 --> 02:27:01.800
season of the TV show, like retro looking game that comes out July

02:27:01.800 --> 02:27:02.200
2nd.

02:27:02.200 --> 02:27:05.400
But this is all well, and this is all a reminder that stranger things

02:27:05.400 --> 02:27:07.400
season three is about to debut on July 4th.

02:27:07.400 --> 02:27:09.320
Cause we're gonna get in July, not October.

02:27:09.320 --> 02:27:11.640
So, uh, cause they didn't do one last year.

02:27:11.640 --> 02:27:12.760
So it's, it's been a while.

02:27:13.400 --> 02:27:15.160
Yeah, I get, yeah, they didn't do one last year.

02:27:15.160 --> 02:27:19.560
So, uh, it's, we had to, we've had to wait since October of 2017 for this.

02:27:19.560 --> 02:27:21.800
Well, that's because the last one took place during Halloween.

02:27:21.800 --> 02:27:23.640
This one takes place, I think around 4th of July.

02:27:23.640 --> 02:27:24.360
So it makes sense.

02:27:24.360 --> 02:27:24.600
Yeah.

02:27:24.600 --> 02:27:27.320
Well, they also might, that might've been a convenient, you know, the way

02:27:27.320 --> 02:27:31.080
they wrote it, but I'm not, you know, the first I binged watched the first

02:27:31.080 --> 02:27:32.680
two seasons, I'll watch this one too.

02:27:32.680 --> 02:27:33.320
Who are we going to get at?

02:27:33.320 --> 02:27:34.440
There's very few TV shows.

02:27:34.440 --> 02:27:37.960
I have this attention span to sit down and watch, but I'll watch it for sure.

02:27:37.960 --> 02:27:38.840
So I'm excited.

02:27:38.840 --> 02:27:39.400
I didn't know.

02:27:39.400 --> 02:27:42.920
I didn't know Netflix put shows out on Blu-ray, but I was at target and they

02:27:42.920 --> 02:27:44.760
were selling the stranger things box set.

02:27:44.760 --> 02:27:47.160
And I was like, but Netflix, okay.

02:27:47.160 --> 02:27:50.360
Wouldn't it cost as much to buy just two months of Netflix?

02:27:50.360 --> 02:27:54.120
I just watched the new season of, um, black mirror too.

02:27:54.120 --> 02:27:58.440
Oh, did you, I have not watched it yet, but I can't escape Ashley.

02:27:58.440 --> 02:28:04.040
Oh, you know, though I'm on a roll achieving my goals.

02:28:04.040 --> 02:28:04.840
I just, I love that.

02:28:04.840 --> 02:28:05.400
It's great.

02:28:05.400 --> 02:28:06.360
How they did that.

02:28:06.360 --> 02:28:08.280
That, that one is an interesting episode.

02:28:08.280 --> 02:28:10.120
There's one that has to do with VR.

02:28:10.120 --> 02:28:13.880
That was, um, interesting to say the least.

02:28:15.240 --> 02:28:16.520
So, all right.

02:28:16.520 --> 02:28:20.360
Anyway, uh, let's move on from stranger things AR.

02:28:20.360 --> 02:28:21.720
Cause that won't be until next year.

02:28:21.720 --> 02:28:23.880
Anyway, Loki on a little more serious tone.

02:28:23.880 --> 02:28:24.120
Yeah.

02:28:24.120 --> 02:28:25.400
Let's talk about riot games.

02:28:25.400 --> 02:28:30.520
So riot games is being investigated apparently by the department of fair

02:28:30.520 --> 02:28:36.280
employment and housing, um, in regards to, I guess, on, they had an ongoing

02:28:36.280 --> 02:28:42.040
investigation to alleged gender discrimination and alleged unequal pay

02:28:42.040 --> 02:28:46.360
sexual harassment, sexual assault, retaliation, uh, gender discrimination,

02:28:46.360 --> 02:28:48.680
select a selection and promotion.

02:28:49.560 --> 02:28:53.240
And apparently the investigation began October, 2018.

02:28:54.040 --> 02:28:55.080
Uh, right.

02:28:55.080 --> 02:29:01.880
Says that they have, um, refused to provide the department with adequate

02:29:01.880 --> 02:29:02.920
information.

02:29:02.920 --> 02:29:06.920
Um, or I guess they're saying that, uh, the department is saying that riot

02:29:06.920 --> 02:29:10.360
games has refused to provide them with adequate information.

02:29:10.360 --> 02:29:10.680
Right.

02:29:10.680 --> 02:29:15.480
Of course is saying though that they have, you know, been supplying them with

02:29:15.480 --> 02:29:22.040
tons of information, including 2,500 or, uh, you know, 2,500 pages of documents

02:29:22.040 --> 02:29:24.680
and several thousand lines of pay data so far.

02:29:25.320 --> 02:29:27.960
And, uh, they're responding promptly.

02:29:27.960 --> 02:29:34.120
So we'll have to see how this all shakes up, but, um, yeah, not really a good

02:29:34.120 --> 02:29:34.920
place to be.

02:29:34.920 --> 02:29:35.160
Yeah.

02:29:35.160 --> 02:29:38.680
All I can say is it feels like the situation keeps escalating here for riot.

02:29:38.680 --> 02:29:42.520
I mean, between, you know, now this outside, I mean, you already had the

02:29:42.520 --> 02:29:46.840
problems from within with the employees, you know, doing their protests and

02:29:46.840 --> 02:29:47.480
things.

02:29:47.480 --> 02:29:47.960
I don't know.

02:29:47.960 --> 02:29:51.160
Like could, could this end up ruining the company?

02:29:51.160 --> 02:29:57.960
I mean, it's just, uh, it's not a good base for them, but, um, I mean, it's, I

02:29:57.960 --> 02:30:01.800
wonder if it's just more of kind of an indication of like kind of the whole,

02:30:02.760 --> 02:30:05.880
um, like that whole area.

02:30:05.880 --> 02:30:10.680
And as a whole, like a lot of these big AAA companies, you know, seem to have a

02:30:10.680 --> 02:30:11.960
lot of the same issues.

02:30:11.960 --> 02:30:16.120
I'm wondering if we'll see more fallout with, if it's, this is successful, you

02:30:16.120 --> 02:30:19.160
know, coming from those other companies and maybe a little bit more proactive

02:30:19.160 --> 02:30:24.680
measures on their part to try to like be more inclusive and just like, don't

02:30:24.680 --> 02:30:26.680
like treat everybody with respect.

02:30:26.680 --> 02:30:28.840
Most importantly, you know, don't be a Dick.

02:30:28.840 --> 02:30:29.000
Yeah.

02:30:29.000 --> 02:30:29.720
Don't be a Dick.

02:30:29.720 --> 02:30:31.240
That's very, very simple.

02:30:31.240 --> 02:30:33.240
So, um, all right.

02:30:33.240 --> 02:30:36.120
Uh, let's move on here and talk a little bit about something.

02:30:36.120 --> 02:30:39.800
This is from E3, but I thought this was, um, really cool for, uh, especially

02:30:39.800 --> 02:30:42.280
those collectors that like to get those little arcade cabinets.

02:30:42.280 --> 02:30:45.240
Uh, those little arcade one up cabinets are getting bigger.

02:30:45.240 --> 02:30:46.040
They're getting bigger.

02:30:46.040 --> 02:30:47.720
They got some bigger licenses.

02:30:47.720 --> 02:30:51.960
So they, they, you know, before we had kind of like a lot of the same Atari

02:30:51.960 --> 02:30:53.240
things we've been seeing for a while.

02:30:53.240 --> 02:30:56.120
Then we started to hear about mortal combat trilogy, you know, street

02:30:56.120 --> 02:30:56.920
fighters, pretty cool.

02:30:56.920 --> 02:30:57.160
Yeah.

02:30:57.160 --> 02:30:57.560
Yeah.

02:30:57.560 --> 02:30:59.960
And now, now they're getting some big ones.

02:30:59.960 --> 02:31:02.840
Teenage mutant Ninja turtles, arcade one up.

02:31:02.840 --> 02:31:03.320
That's right.

02:31:03.320 --> 02:31:05.880
With Ninja turtles and turtles in time.

02:31:05.880 --> 02:31:07.800
And it's four players full.

02:31:07.800 --> 02:31:08.120
Awesome.

02:31:08.120 --> 02:31:10.120
So these are those replica arcade cabinets.

02:31:10.120 --> 02:31:13.560
They're not quite as big as an actual arcade cabinet, but they're great for

02:31:13.560 --> 02:31:16.360
like a bar top or, you know, they're, they're pretty, they're pretty big.

02:31:16.360 --> 02:31:16.600
Yeah.

02:31:17.480 --> 02:31:20.680
It's very comparable to what you used to have in here, which by the way is the,

02:31:20.680 --> 02:31:21.960
the coding place.

02:31:21.960 --> 02:31:23.720
Uh, it's in the back room right now.

02:31:23.720 --> 02:31:27.400
Cause they have to filter out some of the games that were on there because

02:31:27.400 --> 02:31:31.320
apparently when I filtered it out, I only did it for the main category.

02:31:31.320 --> 02:31:34.840
But if you go into subcategories, it's all of the games on there.

02:31:34.840 --> 02:31:38.360
And so they need to just, they want to filter it down to it's like several

02:31:38.360 --> 02:31:39.480
thousand games right now.

02:31:39.480 --> 02:31:41.560
They want to just put like a few on there.

02:31:41.560 --> 02:31:42.840
So they are just working on that.

02:31:42.840 --> 02:31:45.320
My favorite thing though, about the Ninja turtles 90s cabinet that they're

02:31:45.320 --> 02:31:49.160
putting out is that they are retaining the 1990s Ninja turtles art complete

02:31:49.160 --> 02:31:54.120
with that April O'Neil, with that, just that wig that she's got that huge red

02:31:54.120 --> 02:31:55.320
wig that she has.

02:31:55.320 --> 02:31:57.640
And that yellow jumpsuit that she's wearing.

02:31:57.640 --> 02:32:02.280
Like it's like, it's some like Evangeline's costume mansion, Halloween

02:32:02.280 --> 02:32:03.320
realness.

02:32:03.320 --> 02:32:05.320
It's going to be, uh, it's, it's great.

02:32:05.320 --> 02:32:06.120
I love it.

02:32:06.120 --> 02:32:09.240
Um, but that's not all the, I keep focusing on Ninja turtles, but there's

02:32:09.240 --> 02:32:09.960
other ones too.

02:32:09.960 --> 02:32:15.160
There's a Marvel superheroes machine with Marvel superheroes, X-Men children

02:32:15.160 --> 02:32:15.960
of the Adam.

02:32:15.960 --> 02:32:16.840
Whoa, that game is huge.

02:32:16.840 --> 02:32:17.720
And the Punisher.

02:32:17.720 --> 02:32:19.560
That's going to be a hell of a cabinet.

02:32:19.560 --> 02:32:23.000
And then, so they announced those and then they announced one more during the

02:32:23.000 --> 02:32:23.240
show.

02:32:23.240 --> 02:32:26.200
And this one, like I had to text my friend melody right away.

02:32:26.200 --> 02:32:30.920
Cause she is a huge fan of star Wars and there's going to be another cabinet

02:32:30.920 --> 02:32:34.680
with star Wars, the empire strikes back and the return of the Jedi.

02:32:34.680 --> 02:32:39.160
All of those Atari vector games, complete with that yolk controller.

02:32:39.160 --> 02:32:40.600
That is bad-ass.

02:32:40.600 --> 02:32:44.520
So, um, it's almost like, I mean, I wish I had the room to just collect

02:32:44.520 --> 02:32:45.000
some of them.

02:32:45.000 --> 02:32:45.160
God.

02:32:45.160 --> 02:32:45.320
Right.

02:32:45.320 --> 02:32:48.440
But these, these are like hundreds of dollars each, but I'm like, Oh my God.

02:32:48.440 --> 02:32:54.520
I see my, my future basement getting nuttier and nuttier with these, uh,

02:32:54.520 --> 02:32:54.920
things.

02:32:54.920 --> 02:32:57.960
I'm surprised they haven't done like replica pinball machines yet.

02:32:57.960 --> 02:33:01.720
I'm curious, careful, careful, careful what you're thinking.

02:33:01.720 --> 02:33:03.800
Cause I bet that might be a future direction they go in.

02:33:03.800 --> 02:33:06.920
I want to know if Bobby Black Wolf has started eyeing these, if he's got a

02:33:06.920 --> 02:33:09.560
little eye on these going, I might have to do this.

02:33:09.560 --> 02:33:15.240
So it was, I I'm curious if any of these newer ones have tempted him.

02:33:15.240 --> 02:33:17.560
Cause I know he's thinking about building his basement arcade at some

02:33:17.560 --> 02:33:17.720
point.

02:33:17.720 --> 02:33:19.560
I think he wants to finish everything you wanted.

02:33:19.560 --> 02:33:21.080
I need to fix up my cabinet.

02:33:21.080 --> 02:33:23.320
They have, cause it, the monitors out on it.

02:33:23.320 --> 02:33:26.680
And the problem is with that is like, it's already blasphemous.

02:33:26.680 --> 02:33:33.640
I painted it black cause it's a SIG Astra city and, um, everyone paints it

02:33:33.640 --> 02:33:35.400
white because it's a white cabinet.

02:33:35.400 --> 02:33:37.320
I wanted to be different and painted black.

02:33:37.320 --> 02:33:39.240
So already it's an outcast.

02:33:39.240 --> 02:33:44.600
But, um, I wanted to get the monitor fixed and I don't know how to exactly

02:33:44.600 --> 02:33:45.240
to do that.

02:33:45.800 --> 02:33:50.760
Um, I may end up having to replace it with an LCD, but you know, they don't

02:33:50.760 --> 02:33:53.080
make four by three LCDs anymore.

02:33:53.080 --> 02:33:58.600
So I may have to do something not so nice and like get a, you know, 16 by

02:33:58.600 --> 02:34:02.760
nine TV and try to shove it in there, uh, which worked okay for my DDR

02:34:02.760 --> 02:34:03.240
machine.

02:34:03.240 --> 02:34:08.760
So, I mean, it would be fine, but, um, I would like to get that working again.

02:34:08.760 --> 02:34:11.960
And just to be clear, Bobby black Wolf does say in our chat room, I might

02:34:11.960 --> 02:34:12.920
get the star Wars one.

02:34:13.560 --> 02:34:15.080
So he's thinking about it.

02:34:15.080 --> 02:34:15.960
He's thinking about it.

02:34:15.960 --> 02:34:17.480
Anyway, just a couple more stories for you guys.

02:34:17.480 --> 02:34:20.120
Then we're going to invite your calls on our discord channel.

02:34:20.120 --> 02:34:23.880
If you want to join the green room, just head over to head over to vog

02:34:23.880 --> 02:34:25.640
network.com slash discord.

02:34:25.640 --> 02:34:29.560
That'll get you the invite generated into our discord server and you can join

02:34:29.560 --> 02:34:31.720
and hang head over to the green room.

02:34:31.720 --> 02:34:35.160
And it's also great if you could tell us what you'd like to call in about in

02:34:35.160 --> 02:34:37.480
our channel for orange lounge radio.

02:34:37.480 --> 02:34:40.840
We are running a little long tonight with this being, we got a late start and

02:34:40.840 --> 02:34:42.040
it is knee three episodes.

02:34:42.040 --> 02:34:45.400
So I I'm not like, if there's not people wanting to call in, I'm going to move

02:34:45.400 --> 02:34:48.360
right along, but I do want to give an opportunity for folks to call in.

02:34:48.360 --> 02:34:49.960
We will get to that in just a moment.

02:34:49.960 --> 02:34:52.280
We have a couple more stories for you first before we get there.

02:34:52.280 --> 02:34:52.520
Yeah.

02:34:52.520 --> 02:34:55.960
So there's this game called platigo super platform game maker.

02:34:55.960 --> 02:34:58.280
And it basically is what it sounds like.

02:34:58.280 --> 02:35:03.640
It's sort of like, um, I guess a little bit like Mario maker, a little bit like

02:35:03.640 --> 02:35:06.920
RPG maker in which you can make your own platform games.

02:35:06.920 --> 02:35:11.240
And so what's kind of cool about it is they have, um, it is available now on the

02:35:11.240 --> 02:35:13.160
switch and on steam.

02:35:13.160 --> 02:35:16.520
You can actually make, um, retro games similar.

02:35:16.520 --> 02:35:17.800
They have different like art styles.

02:35:17.800 --> 02:35:22.680
So they have like super Nintendo game boy, Commodore 64 styles, Amiga, you can

02:35:22.680 --> 02:35:24.760
design different traps platforms.

02:35:25.400 --> 02:35:30.520
You can even re you know, create your own custom sprites and everything for the

02:35:30.520 --> 02:35:31.640
games themselves.

02:35:31.640 --> 02:35:32.760
It looks pretty cool.

02:35:32.760 --> 02:35:35.640
Uh, it's like 20 bucks right now on steam.

02:35:35.720 --> 02:35:39.480
I don't know if I would pick this up because I probably wouldn't do anything

02:35:39.480 --> 02:35:41.320
with it or wouldn't finish anything with it.

02:35:41.320 --> 02:35:44.760
And we all know, you know, we all know how that is.

02:35:44.760 --> 02:35:47.000
So, um, but it looks neat.

02:35:47.000 --> 02:35:49.960
Um, I'd be curious to see how you can share out this type of stuff.

02:35:49.960 --> 02:35:53.320
I know they showed in the trailer that you can link your levels together so you

02:35:53.320 --> 02:35:56.840
can make like your whole, make a whole game out of it if you wanted to.

02:35:56.840 --> 02:36:00.840
Um, so I'd be curious to see like how this is shared on there.

02:36:00.840 --> 02:36:04.040
If they have like steam, uh, workshop support or something like that.

02:36:04.040 --> 02:36:04.920
That'd be cool.

02:36:04.920 --> 02:36:08.760
I was looking at, it looks a little Mario maker to me, so it looks pretty easy to

02:36:08.760 --> 02:36:09.080
do.

02:36:09.080 --> 02:36:09.240
Yeah.

02:36:09.240 --> 02:36:12.680
And they've got some sprites that comes with in different enemies already, but you

02:36:12.680 --> 02:36:16.520
can like customize gravity so you can kind of do like a little bit like a VVVV.

02:36:17.080 --> 02:36:19.720
Um, they had different hazards.

02:36:19.720 --> 02:36:22.200
I don't know what the limitations are on there.

02:36:22.200 --> 02:36:25.160
The reviews seem to be pretty positive from what I've seen.

02:36:25.160 --> 02:36:29.960
There were some that, you know, they wish that you can export the game to its own

02:36:29.960 --> 02:36:31.320
executable or something like that.

02:36:31.320 --> 02:36:34.680
So you can, I don't know, sell it or share it or whatever.

02:36:34.760 --> 02:36:37.960
But being that, like you can kind of steal sprites from other things.

02:36:37.960 --> 02:36:38.280
I don't know.

02:36:39.080 --> 02:36:40.600
Let's learn game maker at that point.

02:36:40.600 --> 02:36:44.440
But, um, how long is it going to take before you see a world one, one remake?

02:36:44.440 --> 02:36:44.680
Right.

02:36:44.680 --> 02:36:49.720
Oh, I probably already haven't, but, um, how long before we see a level full of

02:36:49.720 --> 02:36:52.280
dicks, but it's, it's cool to like it for 20 bucks.

02:36:52.280 --> 02:36:52.920
That's not bad.

02:36:52.920 --> 02:36:56.840
I mean, compared to like RPG maker, which is like $70 for that shit.

02:36:56.840 --> 02:36:58.360
You know, you should catch it on a sale, but yeah.

02:36:58.360 --> 02:36:59.000
Yeah, exactly.

02:36:59.000 --> 02:37:01.640
So, um, eh, maybe worth checking out.

02:37:02.200 --> 02:37:02.840
Yeah, for sure.

02:37:03.480 --> 02:37:03.880
All right.

02:37:03.960 --> 02:37:08.440
Well, moving on to one more topic here tonight that has to do with Square Enix.

02:37:08.440 --> 02:37:12.040
And you know, a lot of people very jazzed to hear about that Final Fantasy

02:37:12.040 --> 02:37:17.560
Eight remaster and are wondering, could, could maybe Square want to do a Chrono?

02:37:17.560 --> 02:37:20.440
You want to say the word Chrono in a remaster?

02:37:20.440 --> 02:37:21.400
Well, here's the thing.

02:37:21.400 --> 02:37:26.440
Square Enix does want to make their entire back catalog available digitally.

02:37:26.440 --> 02:37:32.280
That includes things like Rad Racer, 3D World Runner and some of those types of games.

02:37:32.280 --> 02:37:33.320
But here's the catch.

02:37:34.120 --> 02:37:38.760
So Square Enix president and CEO Yosuke Matsuda said in an interview, quote,

02:37:38.760 --> 02:37:40.600
we're working on that in a variety of ways.

02:37:40.600 --> 02:37:43.560
That is a request we hear often as far as our major titles go.

02:37:43.560 --> 02:37:46.600
Most of those, we still have variations out that you can play now.

02:37:46.600 --> 02:37:49.320
God, I would love them to bring back Rad Racer as a franchise.

02:37:49.320 --> 02:37:50.520
We'd be fucking awesome.

02:37:50.520 --> 02:37:53.240
The more classic titles that you might've played on NES,

02:37:53.240 --> 02:37:55.800
we're still working hard to make it so you can play those.

02:37:55.800 --> 02:37:59.400
We actually have launched a dedicated project internally to port those.

02:37:59.400 --> 02:38:02.360
So we're working to make them available on a variety of platforms.

02:38:02.360 --> 02:38:04.760
So at least the old Rad Racer, it sounds like you might be able to play.

02:38:04.760 --> 02:38:07.080
I hope they keep the support for the 3D.

02:38:07.080 --> 02:38:07.960
That would be great.

02:38:07.960 --> 02:38:11.000
If you could find an older retro eighties pair of glasses, that would be great.

02:38:12.680 --> 02:38:17.080
Certainly down the road, we would like to see that on a subscription or streaming service.

02:38:19.400 --> 02:38:22.840
So we're exploring the possibility of creating a dedicated channel for ourselves.

02:38:23.480 --> 02:38:25.560
I think everyone is going in that direction streaming.

02:38:25.560 --> 02:38:28.120
So we do want to be proactive in considering those options.

02:38:28.120 --> 02:38:29.960
We still don't know if it would take a subscription service

02:38:29.960 --> 02:38:32.360
or an exclusive downloading service or what form it might take,

02:38:32.360 --> 02:38:34.040
but we do want to leverage our catalog.

02:38:34.040 --> 02:38:39.400
I'm embarrassed to admit it, but in some cases, we don't know where the code is anymore.

02:38:39.400 --> 02:38:42.040
It's very hard to find them sometimes because back in the day,

02:38:42.040 --> 02:38:44.600
you just made them and put them out there and you were done.

02:38:44.600 --> 02:38:47.400
You didn't think of how you were going to sell them down the road.

02:38:47.400 --> 02:38:50.680
Sometimes customers ask, why haven't you released that game yet?

02:38:50.680 --> 02:38:53.480
And the truth of the matter is it's because we don't know where it's gone.

02:38:54.440 --> 02:38:57.880
And like I believe it, like he's absolutely right.

02:38:57.880 --> 02:38:59.960
Back in the day, it was just get the game out.

02:38:59.960 --> 02:39:01.960
You don't think about, oh yeah, I got to get the game out

02:39:01.960 --> 02:39:06.040
and then I want to release it again in 10 more years and it's remastered.

02:39:06.040 --> 02:39:08.040
People weren't thinking like that back then.

02:39:08.040 --> 02:39:09.960
So which is probably a good thing, right?

02:39:09.960 --> 02:39:12.920
But they weren't necessarily retaining the source code.

02:39:12.920 --> 02:39:18.680
So either they're having to go like reverse compile things or I don't know how they're doing it.

02:39:18.680 --> 02:39:22.360
Or like go find the guy who wrote it and make him remember how he did it

02:39:22.360 --> 02:39:23.880
and that whole type of thing.

02:39:23.880 --> 02:39:27.240
So anyway, by the way, a lot of people in our chat room,

02:39:27.240 --> 02:39:29.640
pipe it up at the whole rad racer thing.

02:39:29.640 --> 02:39:31.160
That would be an awesome, like I would,

02:39:31.160 --> 02:39:34.920
even if Square Enix kind of like gave the ability to do that to somebody else.

02:39:34.920 --> 02:39:38.920
Cause I think they could really do anything they want with rad racer.

02:39:40.920 --> 02:39:43.400
The original rad racer, the kick was 3d, right?

02:39:44.120 --> 02:39:47.080
How about rad racer as a VR Square Enix game?

02:39:49.560 --> 02:39:50.060
Yeah.

02:39:50.700 --> 02:39:53.500
Look, if I'm not going to get my, but yeah, it could be,

02:39:53.500 --> 02:39:55.340
it could be pretty rad racer VR.

02:39:55.340 --> 02:39:56.540
I'd be into that.

02:39:56.540 --> 02:39:57.040
Hell yeah.

02:39:58.460 --> 02:40:00.620
Anyway, um, yeah.

02:40:00.620 --> 02:40:01.980
Act deft and chat says, who knew?

02:40:01.980 --> 02:40:03.740
Retro video games would have been profitable.

02:40:03.740 --> 02:40:04.060
Yeah.

02:40:04.060 --> 02:40:05.340
SSG100 Matt says, yeah.

02:40:05.340 --> 02:40:07.580
Back in the day archiving wasn't a thing.

02:40:07.580 --> 02:40:11.660
Um, DJ Rama S says, I thought they were going to announce rad racer three,

02:40:11.660 --> 02:40:13.100
but that was another racing game.

02:40:13.100 --> 02:40:14.780
Square Enix is a backing.

02:40:14.780 --> 02:40:15.340
Well, yeah, that's right.

02:40:15.340 --> 02:40:16.460
There was a rad racer too.

02:40:16.460 --> 02:40:19.660
I always forget that they, they actually did have a rad racer too at one point,

02:40:19.740 --> 02:40:24.300
but it's, it's, uh, you know, pretty easy to forget that that existed.

02:40:24.300 --> 02:40:24.860
All right.

02:40:24.860 --> 02:40:27.420
Anyhow, uh, let's go to listener round table.

02:40:27.420 --> 02:40:30.380
If you want to give us a call, you can, uh, head on over to our discord server,

02:40:30.380 --> 02:40:31.820
but you want to get over there pretty quickly.

02:40:31.820 --> 02:40:33.340
I'm not going to leave it open long.

02:40:33.340 --> 02:40:36.620
Also, if you have questions in chat, if you're like, eh, it's not really worth calling in.

02:40:36.620 --> 02:40:38.060
I just want to ask this question.

02:40:38.060 --> 02:40:40.220
You can go ahead and put that out in our chat room.

02:40:40.220 --> 02:40:43.100
Uh, and, um, see, we'll, we'll get around to it.

02:40:43.660 --> 02:40:49.020
Bobby Black Wolf does point out the BBC destroyed old shows because they needed the shell space.

02:40:49.020 --> 02:40:52.220
Hence why many early doctor who episodes are lost.

02:40:52.220 --> 02:40:52.460
Yeah.

02:40:52.460 --> 02:40:57.340
They had to either like, like they had to find the one guy in the middle of nowhere who taped it

02:40:57.340 --> 02:41:00.380
or like they, I think there's one episode they stitched together.

02:41:00.380 --> 02:41:05.180
Like they had the audio only because somebody had taped the audio and they stitched it together

02:41:05.180 --> 02:41:06.700
with like production stills or something.

02:41:06.700 --> 02:41:10.140
I think there's an episode like that out there, but the BBC destroyed things.

02:41:10.140 --> 02:41:15.180
There was a big news article this week about how some music masters were lost in universal

02:41:15.180 --> 02:41:18.300
studios fire a few years ago, which is really sad.

02:41:18.300 --> 02:41:18.940
Yeah.

02:41:18.940 --> 02:41:21.900
So anyway, uh, before we get to calls, uh, quickly checking in to see if there's any

02:41:21.900 --> 02:41:27.900
last minute stories, I guess E3 and all that.

02:41:27.900 --> 02:41:28.300
Yeah.

02:41:28.300 --> 02:41:31.500
Kind of a lot of nerve there were, yeah, I hear you.

02:41:31.500 --> 02:41:33.740
Anyway, we do have a call coming in, so let's get to it.

02:41:33.740 --> 02:41:34.860
Hi, you're on orange launch radio.

02:41:34.860 --> 02:41:35.180
Who's this?

02:41:35.740 --> 02:41:36.700
Hey, what's up everyone?

02:41:36.700 --> 02:41:37.500
It's Rama.

02:41:37.500 --> 02:41:37.980
Hey Rama.

02:41:37.980 --> 02:41:38.780
Good to hear from you, buddy.

02:41:38.780 --> 02:41:39.420
What's up, buddy?

02:41:39.420 --> 02:41:39.740
What's up?

02:41:39.740 --> 02:41:40.780
It's good to hear from you too.

02:41:40.780 --> 02:41:45.580
But yeah, I was really hyped for that ride race of three, but it was different, uh, racing

02:41:45.580 --> 02:41:45.820
game.

02:41:46.620 --> 02:41:48.060
I, I would love it.

02:41:48.060 --> 02:41:51.740
If square Enix would revisit that property, they don't even have to call it rad racer

02:41:51.740 --> 02:41:51.980
three.

02:41:51.980 --> 02:41:52.300
Come on.

02:41:52.300 --> 02:41:53.100
It's been this long.

02:41:53.100 --> 02:41:54.380
They can just call it rad racer.

02:41:54.380 --> 02:41:55.660
I think people would lose their minds.

02:41:55.660 --> 02:41:56.220
It'd be awesome.

02:41:57.340 --> 02:41:58.060
Exactly.

02:41:58.060 --> 02:42:01.980
But I called it not to talk about themes or E3 at the moment.

02:42:03.500 --> 02:42:03.900
I'm sorry.

02:42:03.900 --> 02:42:04.460
Say that again.

02:42:05.340 --> 02:42:08.540
I said, I called it not to talk about E3, but something else.

02:42:08.540 --> 02:42:09.020
Oh, okay.

02:42:09.020 --> 02:42:09.340
Sure.

02:42:09.340 --> 02:42:09.840
What?

02:42:11.180 --> 02:42:15.260
Did you see the season premiere of pressure luck and card sharks?

02:42:16.620 --> 02:42:17.740
I haven't yet.

02:42:17.740 --> 02:42:22.140
I'm sorry to let you down, but they're an hour, I guess, and not 30 minutes.

02:42:22.140 --> 02:42:25.420
So I just, I haven't got around to it, but I think they're on, they're on Hulu or something,

02:42:25.420 --> 02:42:25.660
right?

02:42:25.660 --> 02:42:26.620
So I'll get around to it.

02:42:26.620 --> 02:42:32.220
I just, I didn't get to it this last week, but I heard, I heard, um, I heard pressure

02:42:32.220 --> 02:42:34.540
luck was good except for that weird bonus round.

02:42:34.540 --> 02:42:35.420
I guess they have at the end.

02:42:36.060 --> 02:42:37.500
Yeah, that was my main issue.

02:42:37.500 --> 02:42:40.300
That took up like the second half hour of the show.

02:42:41.900 --> 02:42:44.060
Oh God, that's a long bonus round.

02:42:44.940 --> 02:42:49.420
Yeah, basically you have a chance to go up against a big board and you get like six chances,

02:42:49.420 --> 02:42:54.060
but as you make it past six chances, you get four chances and so on and so forth.

02:42:54.060 --> 02:42:58.300
So amass as much money as you can, but if you get the whammy four times, that's it.

02:42:59.260 --> 02:42:59.760
Interesting.

02:43:00.940 --> 02:43:04.060
Well, I mean, I guess they had to think of a way to extend it to an hour, but I mean,

02:43:04.060 --> 02:43:06.300
if 30 minutes works, just keep it at 30 minutes.

02:43:06.300 --> 02:43:10.620
It is, it's, it's tough though, when you're a prime time show, I think there's a certain

02:43:11.260 --> 02:43:17.340
expectation that may have worked a little better in daytime, but, um, I, I, I hear Elizabeth

02:43:17.340 --> 02:43:20.940
Banks is doing a good job as a host since, you know, I think they wanted to go a very,

02:43:20.940 --> 02:43:22.460
very different direction.

02:43:22.460 --> 02:43:24.700
You know, obviously Peter Tamarkin is no longer with us.

02:43:24.700 --> 02:43:26.700
So I think they just wanted to go a really different direction.

02:43:26.700 --> 02:43:29.820
It sounds like they, they got a good result with, um, Elizabeth Banks.

02:43:30.540 --> 02:43:32.220
Yeah, she was pretty sassy.

02:43:32.220 --> 02:43:33.500
You'd be proud.

02:43:33.500 --> 02:43:34.460
Good, good.

02:43:34.460 --> 02:43:37.740
And then, uh, Card Sharks, uh, look, I heard it was a lot of fun.

02:43:38.540 --> 02:43:41.580
I was pleasantly surprised by Joel McHale hosting it.

02:43:42.780 --> 02:43:43.020
Yeah.

02:43:43.020 --> 02:43:46.620
Sometimes he can be really annoying, but when he's not like, he's really funny.

02:43:47.420 --> 02:43:47.660
Yeah.

02:43:48.220 --> 02:43:50.780
That was two episodes built into an hour.

02:43:50.780 --> 02:43:52.780
Like they did with Celebrity Family Feud.

02:43:52.780 --> 02:43:57.660
They did change the rounds where they said it's like two rounds of five cards.

02:43:57.660 --> 02:43:59.820
Each is one round of 10 cards.

02:44:00.940 --> 02:44:01.260
Okay.

02:44:01.820 --> 02:44:03.980
Well, that's, that's what they should do with Press Your Luck then.

02:44:03.980 --> 02:44:07.420
They shouldn't feel the need to make it an hour and they just make it two half hour episodes

02:44:07.420 --> 02:44:08.380
back to back or something.

02:44:08.380 --> 02:44:11.420
That's, uh, yeah.

02:44:11.420 --> 02:44:12.300
Now here's, okay.

02:44:12.300 --> 02:44:17.100
So since it is a video game podcast, you know, a lot of early video games and certainly things

02:44:17.100 --> 02:44:20.620
that I remember playing a lot of like good old Commodore 64 and stuff that I remember

02:44:20.620 --> 02:44:23.740
playing was conversions of game shows.

02:44:23.740 --> 02:44:28.220
So do you think that whole game show Renaissance we're seeing, especially on ABC is like their

02:44:28.220 --> 02:44:32.780
summer programming because God, what you have Press Your Luck, you have Card Sharks, you

02:44:32.780 --> 02:44:35.100
have the a hundred thousand dollar pyramid is still a thing, right?

02:44:35.100 --> 02:44:36.940
Or whatever they call it now, pyramid, whatever it is.

02:44:37.020 --> 02:44:37.980
That's still a thing, right?

02:44:37.980 --> 02:44:39.260
Match game is still a thing.

02:44:39.260 --> 02:44:40.940
Family Feud is still a thing.

02:44:40.940 --> 02:44:45.500
Yet, I don't think we have a video game conversion for any of these, not a modern one.

02:44:45.500 --> 02:44:48.140
Granted, you know, a lot, those games that have been around forever.

02:44:48.140 --> 02:44:49.340
Well, are they on mobile though?

02:44:49.980 --> 02:44:50.860
Oh God.

02:44:50.860 --> 02:44:52.380
Why did you have to go there?

02:44:52.380 --> 02:44:57.660
They are mobile, but I think there, I think it might've been Ubisoft or another company

02:44:57.660 --> 02:45:02.620
going back to me about five, six, seven years, they did have like those games.

02:45:02.620 --> 02:45:07.660
Like there was a Price is Right game.

02:45:07.660 --> 02:45:11.740
I've seen that like as a pack-in game on various laptops and desktops back in the day.

02:45:12.860 --> 02:45:13.580
Yeah, true.

02:45:13.580 --> 02:45:17.100
And some folks in chat are naming, there's other game shows still around as well.

02:45:17.100 --> 02:45:19.980
Of course, you know, your old standards, Wheel of Fortune and Jeopardy, those have been on

02:45:19.980 --> 02:45:20.700
forever.

02:45:20.700 --> 02:45:26.140
And I guess Alex Trebek is doing better, which is fantastic to hear.

02:45:26.140 --> 02:45:30.140
Jeopardy's kind of having a Renaissance right now when you got that guy that was so close

02:45:30.140 --> 02:45:33.340
to breaking the record and then just had a bad day or something.

02:45:33.340 --> 02:45:34.700
Didn't, didn't make it at the end there.

02:45:35.340 --> 02:45:38.620
But you know, Jeopardy's kind of having a Renaissance right now between all those things.

02:45:38.620 --> 02:45:40.540
And I feel like that game's going to be around forever.

02:45:40.540 --> 02:45:43.580
And you know, those make for some good game show conversions as well.

02:45:44.860 --> 02:45:46.300
Let's see, what else are they saying here?

02:45:46.940 --> 02:45:47.820
Oh yeah.

02:45:47.820 --> 02:45:51.020
The Are You Smarter Than a Fifth Grader just got rebooted as well.

02:45:51.020 --> 02:45:54.460
My kids totally want to see it now because they're huge fans of John Cena.

02:45:54.460 --> 02:45:57.580
We saw the trailer before they had like the previews before the

02:45:58.460 --> 02:45:59.660
Secret Life of Pets 2.

02:45:59.660 --> 02:46:02.860
So they're like, Oh my God, we've got to watch this show because John Cena is in it.

02:46:02.860 --> 02:46:04.700
So he's fun.

02:46:04.700 --> 02:46:06.700
Make sure you show your kids Double Dare as well.

02:46:07.900 --> 02:46:10.300
Oh yeah, the Double Dare reboot's apparently really good too.

02:46:10.300 --> 02:46:10.700
Yeah.

02:46:10.700 --> 02:46:11.420
It's so good.

02:46:12.460 --> 02:46:13.980
So yeah, game shows are-

02:46:13.980 --> 02:46:17.820
I just got to figure out which streaming service that's on because I don't have technically

02:46:17.820 --> 02:46:21.180
cable, but I have like Hulu and Amazon and Netflix.

02:46:22.060 --> 02:46:24.620
I just don't think any of those have those.

02:46:24.620 --> 02:46:26.860
It's like probably its own standalone Nickelodeon.

02:46:27.340 --> 02:46:30.140
Kaijuto in chat says game shows never went away.

02:46:30.140 --> 02:46:33.900
They just bring back old classics, but we've had primetime game shows for decades that

02:46:33.900 --> 02:46:34.700
hasn't changed.

02:46:34.700 --> 02:46:35.740
That's true.

02:46:35.740 --> 02:46:37.820
I mean, you know, game shows have kind of always been a thing.

02:46:37.820 --> 02:46:43.020
Well, especially in daytime, like The Price is Right hasn't stopped since the sixties

02:46:43.020 --> 02:46:44.780
when that's, I mean, that show has been on forever.

02:46:44.780 --> 02:46:47.500
Wheel of Fortune and Jeopardy, they've been on nonstop since the eighties.

02:46:48.220 --> 02:46:51.180
And Let's Make a Deal is on CBS.

02:46:51.180 --> 02:46:52.060
Oh yeah, that's back.

02:46:52.060 --> 02:46:55.100
Let's Make a Deal has been on for quite some time for sure.

02:46:55.500 --> 02:46:59.180
And then, you know, there's always Games for Network and also game shows kind of took a

02:46:59.180 --> 02:47:03.740
little turn and not everybody's going to be a fan of this, but in some ways, things like

02:47:03.740 --> 02:47:06.540
Survivor are a game show, right?

02:47:06.540 --> 02:47:08.780
Yeah, you do win a million dollars, right?

02:47:08.780 --> 02:47:10.460
And it is a game that they're playing.

02:47:10.460 --> 02:47:12.620
It's just a very different, very psychological game.

02:47:12.620 --> 02:47:15.980
That's not always glamorous, but Survivor in many ways is a game show.

02:47:15.980 --> 02:47:20.460
It's just a very different type that then kind of started its own genre where you still

02:47:20.460 --> 02:47:21.900
have Amazing Race on there.

02:47:21.900 --> 02:47:23.340
Amazing Race is still going.

02:47:24.140 --> 02:47:25.420
Don't get out of the kitchen.

02:47:25.420 --> 02:47:26.220
I mean, come on.

02:47:26.220 --> 02:47:31.900
It's Amazing Race is meta at this point because Amazing Race this current season is all, it's

02:47:31.900 --> 02:47:37.020
either people that prior played the Amazing Race versus Survivor contestants as teams

02:47:37.020 --> 02:47:39.500
versus Big Brother contestants as teams.

02:47:39.500 --> 02:47:40.700
So that's all getting meta.

02:47:40.700 --> 02:47:42.140
And Big Brother is another type.

02:47:42.140 --> 02:47:44.780
Then Big Brother is kind of like the Jerry Springer of game shows.

02:47:46.380 --> 02:47:49.100
But I live for it.

02:47:49.100 --> 02:47:50.380
I'll watch it for sure.

02:47:50.380 --> 02:47:55.660
So, yeah, Bobby Black Wolf in chat says the mole with Anderson Cooper is still the best.

02:47:55.660 --> 02:47:56.860
Co-signed.

02:47:56.860 --> 02:48:00.940
Man, I wish they'd bring back the mole, which I realized they've already done twice, but

02:48:00.940 --> 02:48:02.700
they haven't done it as good as the first time.

02:48:02.700 --> 02:48:05.420
They need to find a host as good as Anderson Cooper.

02:48:05.420 --> 02:48:06.060
I know.

02:48:06.620 --> 02:48:09.660
I mean, you might say nobody is going to be as good as Anderson Cooper and that may or

02:48:09.660 --> 02:48:09.900
may not.

02:48:09.900 --> 02:48:11.420
No, I would be as good as Anderson Cooper.

02:48:11.420 --> 02:48:12.860
I will host the fucking mole reboot.

02:48:13.580 --> 02:48:16.460
Somebody, but obviously they're not going to give me a call.

02:48:17.260 --> 02:48:19.020
Obviously they're not going to give me a call.

02:48:19.020 --> 02:48:21.820
Somebody out there has got to have that tongue in cheek.

02:48:22.460 --> 02:48:27.100
Who could, who would be a good person that's like kind of serious when they need to be,

02:48:27.100 --> 02:48:30.060
but very tongue in cheek when the time is appropriate.

02:48:30.060 --> 02:48:32.300
I think kind of Jeff Probst is very good at this too.

02:48:32.300 --> 02:48:37.100
Although I think Jeff Probst was, is kind of a better host than he is a producer.

02:48:37.100 --> 02:48:37.900
I'm not sure.

02:48:37.900 --> 02:48:40.780
Like this last season of Survivor was not good.

02:48:40.780 --> 02:48:44.860
And this new season of Survivor is looking a little, but

02:48:45.020 --> 02:48:47.660
as far as Survivor goes, there's an all winners edition.

02:48:47.660 --> 02:48:49.180
That's like the next one.

02:48:49.660 --> 02:48:52.940
And everybody, like everybody's hyped about that.

02:48:52.940 --> 02:48:57.020
Like, because it's going to be, because you believe it or not guys, Survivor is coming

02:48:57.020 --> 02:48:59.340
up on its 40th season.

02:48:59.340 --> 02:49:04.620
So this next one's 39 in the fall, 40 is going to be, so for their 40th edition, they found

02:49:04.620 --> 02:49:09.820
16 prior winners to make up the cast because they have so many people to choose from.

02:49:09.820 --> 02:49:11.660
So now the winners are going to do battle.

02:49:11.660 --> 02:49:13.340
So that's, that's pretty cool though.

02:49:13.580 --> 02:49:17.820
So somebody is going to go from winning the game to getting voted out first, but that

02:49:17.820 --> 02:49:19.180
already happened actually.

02:49:19.180 --> 02:49:23.820
Survivor geek, for back in the day, I don't watch the new ones as much, but the old ones

02:49:23.820 --> 02:49:27.340
that happened to Tina, she won Survivor, the Australian Outback, and then Survivor All-Stars,

02:49:27.340 --> 02:49:30.780
she got voted out first because she was a prior winner.

02:49:30.780 --> 02:49:32.220
So, whoops.

02:49:32.220 --> 02:49:34.540
Anyway, yes.

02:49:34.540 --> 02:49:39.820
Going to chat over at Twitch, Act F says one versus 100 in video game form again.

02:49:39.820 --> 02:49:40.620
That'd be great.

02:49:40.620 --> 02:49:42.940
DJ Rama S says Millionaire was canceled.

02:49:42.940 --> 02:49:46.700
Yeah, Millionaire was going for a long time and it went through many hosts.

02:49:46.700 --> 02:49:50.060
Like it had, obviously the Regis Philbin won in prime time, but the Meredith Vieira one

02:49:50.060 --> 02:49:51.500
went for a long time.

02:49:51.500 --> 02:49:53.180
And then who hosted after her?

02:49:53.180 --> 02:49:56.060
Cedric the Entertainer, I think, for a minute.

02:49:56.060 --> 02:50:03.020
And then they had one of the guys from Dancing with the Stars did it, and then now it's done.

02:50:03.020 --> 02:50:04.140
I don't think it's on anymore.

02:50:04.140 --> 02:50:08.380
So, oh, Shane says it's not 16 winners.

02:50:08.620 --> 02:50:10.540
Oh, Shane says it's not 16 winners.

02:50:10.540 --> 02:50:11.420
It's 20.

02:50:11.420 --> 02:50:12.140
Holy crap.

02:50:12.780 --> 02:50:16.140
And no, apparently Richard Hatch is not in it for whatever reason.

02:50:17.100 --> 02:50:22.140
People are speculating it could be because of the jail time that he served from not paying

02:50:22.140 --> 02:50:28.700
his taxes the first time, or the fact that there was something that really, really hasn't

02:50:28.700 --> 02:50:29.260
aged well.

02:50:29.260 --> 02:50:32.300
Well, it wasn't good when it happened, but in the original All-Stars...

02:50:32.300 --> 02:50:33.580
Didn't I just talk about this on OR?

02:50:33.580 --> 02:50:35.020
Yes, like last week.

02:50:35.020 --> 02:50:37.100
Go back to OR like three weeks ago, I talked about this earlier.

02:50:37.100 --> 02:50:39.420
It was a sexual harassment thing that happened, and it wasn't good.

02:50:39.420 --> 02:50:44.700
So anyway, okay, enough about the old game shows.

02:50:45.660 --> 02:50:49.740
What game show would you want to see them make a new video game out of most of all?

02:50:50.780 --> 02:50:51.740
Oh, man.

02:50:54.140 --> 02:50:59.420
I mean, with interactivity and so forth, I would have to say it would have to be a toss-up

02:50:59.420 --> 02:51:04.220
between Double Dare or Funhaus, because I love to live in daylight to hope those game shows.

02:51:05.020 --> 02:51:08.300
It'll be hard to translate those to video games, though, but they are fun shows.

02:51:08.300 --> 02:51:11.180
But it's just not the same if you don't have actual gak to go through.

02:51:11.180 --> 02:51:11.980
I got a good one.

02:51:11.980 --> 02:51:12.220
Okay.

02:51:12.860 --> 02:51:15.420
So I want to see a VR version of Nick Arcade.

02:51:16.620 --> 02:51:20.220
So like, you're actually standing up, you know, hitting the buzzer and everything like

02:51:20.220 --> 02:51:23.580
that, and we have to go into the actual arcade, like, arcade game.

02:51:23.580 --> 02:51:24.860
It'd be VR, and you can just...

02:51:25.820 --> 02:51:26.700
Okay, all right.

02:51:27.340 --> 02:51:28.380
Um, my answer...

02:51:28.380 --> 02:51:30.300
I just wanted to bring back 1 vs 100.

02:51:30.300 --> 02:51:32.940
I think that was a great concept that was ahead of its time.

02:51:32.940 --> 02:51:33.980
Or VR Guts.

02:51:33.980 --> 02:51:37.100
Let's just do VR, all of the Nick, all the Nick stuff.

02:51:37.100 --> 02:51:37.740
Yeah.

02:51:37.740 --> 02:51:38.240
All right.

02:51:38.700 --> 02:51:40.460
Rama, I'm going to let you go so we can wrap up the show.

02:51:40.460 --> 02:51:41.260
But thanks for the call.

02:51:41.260 --> 02:51:42.940
You know, I'll always talk about old game shows.

02:51:43.900 --> 02:51:46.380
Let me just say 1 vs 100 before I get out of here.

02:51:46.380 --> 02:51:46.700
Yeah.

02:51:46.700 --> 02:51:49.740
One night, a special all-anime edition.

02:51:49.740 --> 02:51:55.500
So all of my squad were on Xbox Live, trash-talking each other, going through the questions.

02:51:56.380 --> 02:52:01.420
At the end of the round, at the end of the game, I was up there at the number two slot.

02:52:01.420 --> 02:52:03.260
And I wish I still had a screenshot of that.

02:52:04.620 --> 02:52:05.900
Nice, nice.

02:52:05.900 --> 02:52:06.780
That's great.

02:52:06.780 --> 02:52:08.060
I wish I was around the night.

02:52:08.060 --> 02:52:10.940
They did like a video game trivia night, but I couldn't make it.

02:52:10.940 --> 02:52:12.380
But I know I would have kicked butt at it.

02:52:12.380 --> 02:52:18.620
But I need to get motivated and really assert myself to do more game show hosting panels at cons.

02:52:18.620 --> 02:52:21.020
I really should have bid to try to do one at Dragon Comet.

02:52:21.020 --> 02:52:23.100
It's one of those things I just didn't think of until after the fact.

02:52:23.100 --> 02:52:27.580
But I would love to host more game shows at conventions because I think it's a lot of fun.

02:52:27.580 --> 02:52:31.180
And some of the ones that I've been to needed some help.

02:52:31.180 --> 02:52:33.420
So that's my goal.

02:52:33.420 --> 02:52:35.020
I think I'm gonna make that a goal in the next year.

02:52:35.020 --> 02:52:38.060
I will host a game show at a convention and it will be awesome.

02:52:38.780 --> 02:52:42.460
Rob, you need to get connected to some various people because that's the big thing,

02:52:42.460 --> 02:52:43.820
especially anime con.

02:52:43.820 --> 02:52:50.060
There are game show departments and you got people who are writing horror point presentations

02:52:50.060 --> 02:52:53.500
and flash games templates just to run these game shows.

02:52:53.500 --> 02:52:59.180
And I'm actually trying to put something together like Family Feud set up for a con next year.

02:53:01.020 --> 02:53:01.660
That'll be fun.

02:53:02.620 --> 02:53:03.420
Yeah.

02:53:03.420 --> 02:53:04.220
All right.

02:53:04.220 --> 02:53:04.860
All right, my friend.

02:53:04.860 --> 02:53:05.740
I'm gonna let you go.

02:53:05.740 --> 02:53:06.380
So take care.

02:53:07.180 --> 02:53:07.660
You too.

02:53:07.660 --> 02:53:08.620
Stay fabulous, man.

02:53:08.620 --> 02:53:09.340
I will.

02:53:09.340 --> 02:53:09.740
Take care.

02:53:09.740 --> 02:53:09.900
Bye.

02:53:11.260 --> 02:53:11.820
All right.

02:53:11.820 --> 02:53:13.580
Always good to hear from Rama.

02:53:13.580 --> 02:53:14.460
But that is gonna do it.

02:53:14.460 --> 02:53:15.740
Nobody else is waiting on Discord.

02:53:15.740 --> 02:53:19.420
So we'll go ahead and close down Discord because I think it's about time we wrap up the show

02:53:20.460 --> 02:53:22.220
and get on out of here for the night.

02:53:22.220 --> 02:53:24.700
So I want to thank you all for listening though tonight.

02:53:24.700 --> 02:53:28.380
Whether you were watching along with us live on Twitch or you're listening to this on the podcast

02:53:28.380 --> 02:53:32.700
feed where of course the show is still always available in places like iTunes, Google Play

02:53:32.700 --> 02:53:33.500
Store and so on.

02:53:33.500 --> 02:53:36.620
Yes, I know we need to get into more places and I'm going to be working on that in the

02:53:36.620 --> 02:53:37.660
very new future.

02:53:37.660 --> 02:53:43.900
I'm also, since next week is a birthday show of sorts, I am working on some things for

02:53:43.900 --> 02:53:51.820
next week to try to, as has been said in one Food Network guy, kick it up a notch a little

02:53:51.820 --> 02:53:52.060
bit.

02:53:52.060 --> 02:53:56.540
So in other words, what he's trying to tell you is that he's going to be acquiring a buzzer.

02:53:57.500 --> 02:53:58.540
That too.

02:53:58.540 --> 02:53:59.660
I'll be working on that.

02:53:59.660 --> 02:54:02.060
That wasn't on my list until tonight, but there it is.

02:54:02.060 --> 02:54:06.940
Anyway, so if you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Laundry tonight, tell a friend or

02:54:06.940 --> 02:54:07.580
two about the show.

02:54:07.580 --> 02:54:10.380
Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice.

02:54:10.380 --> 02:54:15.020
But if the voices aren't here to put out on the air, then how can we possibly air them?

02:54:15.020 --> 02:54:19.580
So with that, Loki, thank you, of course, for being here as you always are.

02:54:19.580 --> 02:54:21.660
Do you have any last thoughts for listeners tonight?

02:54:22.300 --> 02:54:23.420
I may stream this week.

02:54:23.420 --> 02:54:23.820
I don't know.

02:54:23.820 --> 02:54:30.460
Depends whether I decide to do some streaming or be ridiculous and work extra long hours

02:54:30.460 --> 02:54:31.340
on work stuff.

02:54:32.460 --> 02:54:33.580
So, you know, I don't know.

02:54:33.580 --> 02:54:37.020
We'll see how it goes, but I've got several nights I can do it, so.

02:54:39.740 --> 02:54:40.300
We'll see.

02:54:40.300 --> 02:54:41.500
Or I could clean the house.

02:54:42.540 --> 02:54:44.940
None of those sound like fun ideas, except for streaming.

02:54:44.940 --> 02:54:45.820
That's why you have kids.

02:54:45.820 --> 02:54:46.860
Make them clean.

02:54:46.860 --> 02:54:49.260
Or they don't eat dinner.

02:54:49.260 --> 02:54:49.740
Or they don't.

02:54:49.740 --> 02:54:50.380
Yeah, right.

02:54:51.340 --> 02:54:58.300
Anyway, my final thought for the night is, hey, if you if you can get your butt to Dragon

02:54:58.300 --> 02:55:03.180
Con over Labor Day weekend in Atlanta, I can't say too much, but some of the early stuff

02:55:03.180 --> 02:55:06.620
is starting to take shape and it's going to it's going to be a heck of a year.

02:55:06.620 --> 02:55:08.220
It's going to be a really fun year.

02:55:08.220 --> 02:55:10.300
I'm finally getting extra for to go this year.

02:55:10.300 --> 02:55:11.900
Need I say more that alone?

02:55:11.900 --> 02:55:15.820
I really want to before there's any talk about any panels or any of that stuff.

02:55:15.820 --> 02:55:17.900
That alone should be the reason to go to Dragon Con.

02:55:17.900 --> 02:55:18.620
It's gonna be fun.

02:55:18.620 --> 02:55:19.740
How many days is Dragon Con?

02:55:20.780 --> 02:55:21.500
It runs.

02:55:21.500 --> 02:55:22.700
It's technically now.

02:55:22.700 --> 02:55:24.300
Thursday is technically a day now.

02:55:24.300 --> 02:55:28.460
It was Thursday through Sunday, Thursday through Monday, Monday weekend, Thursday,

02:55:28.460 --> 02:55:29.740
you don't have to go every day.

02:55:29.740 --> 02:55:30.780
A lot of locals don't.

02:55:30.780 --> 02:55:33.180
They just go to the parade and maybe go to a day on Saturday.

02:55:33.180 --> 02:55:38.780
But no, this year I'm going to be gone this year for nine days.

02:55:38.780 --> 02:55:41.900
I think it is because I'm going to visit extra for North Carolina.

02:55:41.900 --> 02:55:42.700
I'm actually going to miss.

02:55:42.700 --> 02:55:46.860
So at the end of August, just to warn you guys, we're going to miss two weeks of our.

02:55:46.860 --> 02:55:51.020
I'm really sorry, but hey, Dragon Con is just that big a deal this year

02:55:51.740 --> 02:55:53.340
where we're going to miss one week because Dragon Con,

02:55:53.340 --> 02:55:56.460
I'm actually flying out the Saturday before, so I'll miss that Sunday.

02:55:56.460 --> 02:56:00.300
So my hope is we can actually prior record so that we don't miss a time,

02:56:00.300 --> 02:56:02.140
but we'll have a prior recorded show the week before.

02:56:02.140 --> 02:56:07.660
Or we'll just do the Orange Lounge Pirate Radio Show where I will host in my dirty ass garage.

02:56:07.660 --> 02:56:09.740
You and Jamie have every right to take over for a night.

02:56:09.740 --> 02:56:12.220
It's just, you know, you got to get me the MP3 so we can get it posted.

02:56:12.220 --> 02:56:15.020
But yeah, the Pirate Radio version, that'd be a lot of fun.

02:56:15.020 --> 02:56:16.060
So, all right.

02:56:17.500 --> 02:56:19.500
Anyway, yeah.

02:56:19.500 --> 02:56:21.660
Bobby Blackwell says our Dragon Con starts Wednesday.

02:56:21.660 --> 02:56:25.660
We'll try to film something at Dragon Con and premiere it on our usual slot.

02:56:25.660 --> 02:56:30.620
That's also a good call is that we will probably film something.

02:56:30.620 --> 02:56:33.340
And because Twitch does let us do video on demand,

02:56:33.340 --> 02:56:36.460
we can probably actually film, edit and have it up

02:56:37.020 --> 02:56:41.660
on the Twitch TV for Sunday night at 8 Eastern, 5 Pacific.

02:56:41.660 --> 02:56:42.780
So that's very likely.

02:56:42.780 --> 02:56:45.420
It won't be like OLR and it won't be Bobby Blackwell,

02:56:45.420 --> 02:56:49.340
but it'll be some of the faces having fun at Dragon Con.

02:56:49.340 --> 02:56:50.380
I think it'll be a good time.

02:56:50.380 --> 02:56:51.820
So anyway, but stay tuned for that.

02:56:51.820 --> 02:56:53.020
That's still a few months away.

02:56:53.020 --> 02:56:56.300
I would just encourage you to be there in person in Atlanta if you can.

02:56:56.300 --> 02:56:57.580
But we're going to wrap up this week's show.

02:56:57.580 --> 02:57:02.540
We'll be back in seven days to celebrate 17 years of Orange Lounge Radio.

02:57:03.340 --> 02:57:04.540
17 years.

02:57:04.540 --> 02:57:06.780
Old enough, just about old enough to vote.

02:57:06.780 --> 02:57:08.140
Old enough to have a job.

02:57:08.140 --> 02:57:09.820
Old enough to be a senior in high school.

02:57:09.820 --> 02:57:14.860
We'll be back here to celebrate that next week with you all.

02:57:15.500 --> 02:57:17.420
Many opportunities to call in next week

02:57:17.420 --> 02:57:18.940
and hopefully some other special treats as well.

02:57:18.940 --> 02:57:22.220
So we really hope you'll join us here for our 17th birthday next week.

02:57:22.220 --> 02:57:24.140
In the meantime, happy gaming.

02:57:24.140 --> 02:57:25.340
Lots of games to play.

02:57:25.340 --> 02:57:27.020
Go play them and be nice.

02:57:27.020 --> 02:57:27.260
Bye.

02:57:28.220 --> 02:57:30.860
