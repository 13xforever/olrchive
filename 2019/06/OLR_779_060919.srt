00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
With your hosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
It's the annual Obvious Headline, E3 is upon us!

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Hopefully next year I won't have to intro how teased we still are about the forthcoming 9th console generation.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:28,000
This is the week's most obvious headline, stay tuned for the rest of the week's gaming news starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

Orange Lounge Radio

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Loki, it's happening! It's happening! Loki, I can't believe it, it's fucking happening!

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Phantasy Star Online 2 in the west, finally! Finally, Loki, finally!

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Do you know how many years? How many years have you been waiting for Phantasy Star Online 2?

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Several, yes.

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Hi! Welcome everybody! It's another week of Orange Lounge Radio, happy E3!

12
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:05,000
It's a show where every gamer has a voice and we talk, of course, for 3 hours every week about video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

13
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:14,000
My name is the very excited Rob Roberts to cover what would be, what, like our 16th year of E3 shenanigans and probably a game I've been waiting for 16 years to talk about.

14
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I am, of course, Rob Roberts and with me, as always, is Techmaster Loki.

15
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Hello.

16
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:29,000
And not joining us tonight, Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers. She has the night off, she has a conflict tonight with her sister's organization.

17
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
She's doing the Pride event in Sacramento with the sister group today.

18
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
But, of course, she sends her love and all that.

19
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
And, you know, for her, Animal Crossing is going to be covered on next week's show anyway.

20
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:47,000
So tonight is going to be about some of the things we've seen thus far from Microsoft and all that good stuff.

21
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:57,000
So, anyway. Alright. Let's get into it. I mean, it's E3. E3's back and we've covered a lot of stuff already.

22
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
You're actually kind of keeping an eye on Bethesda's stuff as we're going, right?

23
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Yeah.

24
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
There's a lot of fluff, I guess, going on.

25
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:12,000
It's been, like, you know, they just for the last 10 minutes or so have been showing off mobile games, which no one gives a shit about.

26
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
And then now they're showing off some stuff for Rage 2, which, yeah, that's cool.

27
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Yeah, that's cool. Alright. Well, we'll cover all the bullet points on Bethesda a little bit later, but let's get into.

28
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Did you have a chance to watch Microsoft's event?

29
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,000
And, you know, I kind of would imagine it's kind of the tentpole event for a lot of people today.

30
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Did you have a chance to look at it?

31
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I did watch it, yes. I watched the whole thing.

32
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Yeah?

33
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
And it was pretty good. They had lots of game announcements.

34
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Lots of other, like, they talked about their new console.

35
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:48,000
They talked about that Games Pass, you know, on PC now and, you know, the new Game Pass Ultimate stuff, which is pretty awesome.

36
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
So lots of games.

37
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Yeah, definitely the message overall for Microsoft was games, games, games, games.

38
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
And I think that's a very good thing.

39
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:06,000
You know, most people that I talk to that tend to be, like, anti-Microsoft or whatever, or I wouldn't say, like, anti-Microsoft, but maybe, like, just doesn't support Xbox or doesn't own an Xbox One.

40
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:12,000
A lot of people are like, eh, they just don't really have the games. Or, you know, the games I want are on PlayStation or Nintendo Switch is more for me.

41
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Yeah.

42
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:19,000
You know, I'm not sure. Well, I'm not sure. I find it also kind of matters what type of games you're into.

43
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:25,000
And I'm not sure that maybe we saw a lot at Microsoft's events today that was going to change anybody's mind on that.

44
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
That is a little bit of everything.

45
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,000
There was some peppering of stuff, like the Tales of games as far as RPGs go and things like that.

46
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Yeah.

47
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
You know, I think there were a few things.

48
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:41,000
But I don't know if anybody's mind, especially just judging off, like, Twitter reactions and so forth, I don't know if anybody's mind was changed on Microsoft.

49
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
But I don't think that means to say that Microsoft did a bad job. I don't think they did by any means.

50
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:53,000
And I don't really know what needs a change with Microsoft since most of their games, like, I think everybody has a PC, so most of those games are going to be playable on PC anyways.

51
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Right. Right.

52
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
So, yeah.

53
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I'm going to go down the list.

54
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I made a big old list of stuff.

55
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:04,000
So, obviously, I don't want to talk at length about necessarily everything, but certainly, I mean, there's a lot to talk about.

56
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
So, it all started off with a game called Outer Worlds that looked very Fallout-y to me.

57
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I know we've kind of heard of this game before.

58
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Yeah, that was last year, too, they talked about it.

59
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
But we'll see it in motion a little more.

60
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Yeah.

61
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Right? And so, it looks a little Fallout-y to me, which I think some of the developers...

62
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
It's the original developers of Fallout, like, New Vegas.

63
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
But, like, in space, which is cool.

64
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Yeah.

65
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Yeah. So, I was kind of into it.

66
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Yeah, it looks good.

67
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Yeah, I want to get it.

68
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Look kind of neat.

69
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,000
It's a 4v4 that looks kind of like Overwatch, like, especially like the...

70
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
A melee Overwatch, I guess?

71
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Yeah, like a melee Overwatch.

72
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Like, the character designs.

73
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Kind of what made me think of Overwatch is that it's trying to do these very strong kind of character designs, which I'm standing, Buttercup.

74
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Thank you very much.

75
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
But, otherwise, you know, I kind of...

76
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:49,000
As is the case with a lot of these game announcements and game previews and trailers and things like this,

77
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
it doesn't always necessarily, like, show the actual game in motion.

78
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
And that's what I really want to see.

79
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Like, what does it look like when you play it?

80
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
But it looked kind of neat.

81
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I'm, you know, kind of interested.

82
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
So, let's see.

83
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Ori and the Whisper Wards?

84
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Whispering Woods?

85
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Whispering Woods?

86
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Whispering Woods.

87
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
The new Ori game.

88
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
And that looked...

89
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I mean, the last Ori game is great.

90
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
It's kind of like a Metroidvania, if you're not sure where those games are.

91
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
But, like, the art style is really phenomenal.

92
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Like, obviously, it has that look to it.

93
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,000
And I like that they kind of showed a lot of different boss characters and these different types of varied environments that just...

94
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
They look like paintings in motion.

95
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
It's really, really nice.

96
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I'm sure that game is going to do very well for them.

97
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,000
And then, they started to show from the developers of Minecraft.

98
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:36,000
And I was like, is this finally the Minecraft 2 that I've been screaming about every year?

99
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,000
They had already shown this at, like, I think the Minecon thing.

100
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
They showed this off.

101
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
So, this wasn't necessarily a new thing.

102
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
But it's like, you know, it's your Minecraft Diablo game.

103
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Which, I'm here for it, TBH.

104
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Because when we get to our gaming weeks, I've been playing a lot of Diablo this week.

105
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
And that game is almost as old as Phantasy Star Online 2 in Japan.

106
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
And here I am still playing it.

107
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
But I like the idea of combining it in the Minecraft world.

108
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
By the way, speaking of, like, different platforms and things of that nature.

109
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I don't know if you noticed, but at the same time that Microsoft was showing off the Minecraft Dungeons trailer.

110
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Nintendo Switch posted it to their official Facebook page.

111
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
They posted that same trailer.

112
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
So, basically confirming that Minecraft Dungeons will also be on Nintendo Switch.

113
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Even though it's a Minecraft game.

114
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Even though it's a Microsoft game.

115
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
But, of course, Minecraft was on all those platforms anyway, right?

116
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Well, you know, Steve is totally going to be announced for Smash tomorrow.

117
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
So, it's fine.

118
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Or, when's Nintendo? Is that on Tuesday?

119
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
It might be Tuesday.

120
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
You know, Miyamoto was actually at Microsoft's press conference.

121
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,000
A lot of people were talking, oh my god, Miyamoto's sited there.

122
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
This Nintendo's in bed with Microsoft.

123
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Phantasy's about to come true.

124
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:57,000
And it turns out, no, it's just actually kind of customary that the competition gets invited to all the pressers.

125
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I want to say, when we went to the Sony event one year, we spotted the guys that were with Microsoft at the time in attendance.

126
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Like, it happens.

127
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
It's a nicety. It's a formality.

128
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
The gaming industry is not that big.

129
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
A lot of these people tend to go from one company to the other.

130
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Hell, look at Phil, not to get too ahead of myself, but look at Phil Harrison with the Google Stadia stuff.

131
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Where did that guy used to be?

132
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Microsoft, right?

133
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
So, you know, these guys will go around the industry.

134
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
So, they all still treat each other very nicely.

135
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
So, let's see.

136
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Interesting comment from Bobby Black Wolf as we do tape live.

137
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Of course, we tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern at our Twitch channel.

138
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
twitch.tv slash vog network.

139
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
And we are right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

140
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
And Bobby himself is in chat right now saying,

141
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
the gaming companies don't hate each other as much as their fans do.

142
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,000
That's a very, that's what we say, tea.

143
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Tea.

144
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
That's very much tea.

145
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
That's a hot piping cup of tea.

146
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Alright, anyway.

147
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Let's see.

148
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
The next bit they showed was Jedi Fallen Order, which was...

149
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Yeah, that looked pretty good.

150
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Had already been touched on at the EA Play event, but it looked really cool in motion.

151
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I don't necessarily always get into those Star Wars games, but that one looked like...

152
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Well, and the other thing is Respawn for a moment.

153
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
If we can talk about Respawn, they're really killing it for EA right now.

154
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Between like Apex and I know a lot of people slept on Titanfall,

155
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
but I think now people are thinking, oh, I should have maybe go back and appreciate Titanfall.

156
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Like Respawn's doing a lot of great stuff for EA right now.

157
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
And this appears to be another one that may do very well.

158
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:38,000
As long as this doesn't screw up the loot box thing like the last Star Wars game from another studio.

159
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
But I think EA's learned their lesson a little bit.

160
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
A little bit.

161
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I'm not going to say they've completely turned around.

162
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
They're certainly not going to make that same mistake again, that's for sure.

163
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Let's see.

164
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
We also, after that, had a game...

165
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Oh, this?

166
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Okay, so the next trailer comes up and it's a forest and the guy's got a flashlight and I'm like,

167
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,000
oh my fucking god, is this a new Alan Wake game because I'm about to lose my shit.

168
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:06,000
But then the trailer gets a little intense for what I think Alan Wake would usually be.

169
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
So I'm like, okay, I don't think this is actually Alan Wake.

170
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:13,000
And it turns out it's a setup for a Blair Witch game,

171
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:18,000
which looks like it's not like, you know, they're not going to make a video game based on a movie from 20...

172
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
It would literally be 20 years ago at this point, my god.

173
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Because actually I think that movie had a video game on like PS1 or PC or something.

174
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,000
But I think it's just the myth.

175
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,000
But then again, they have like, you know, Friday the 13th game.

176
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:42,000
And they also have other like, you know, serial killer games or, you know, movie horror mascot games.

177
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
No, super good point.

178
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Dead by Daylight.

179
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Yeah, Dead by Daylight brings back like all the greatest hits in that game.

180
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,000
So like, you know, horror movies tend to get revisited in gaming.

181
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
That's not a new concept.

182
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
But I think with Friday the 13th, you know, that was more like an arena type of game.

183
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
You know, it's...

184
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
This is more like atmospheric, more like slender type stuff.

185
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Plot thing going on.

186
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Yeah.

187
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
We were actually doing a live chat at a VoG network on Twitch.

188
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:10,000
So we like hosted the stream that had like our own chat room that you could actually read the comments as opposed to going like this.

189
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Like the official chats do with all the emotes and everything.

190
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
With all the emotes for clowns.

191
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Which I see you're watching Bethesda.

192
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
And all I can see in that chat over there is emotes.

193
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Clowns, it's clowns.

194
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Clowns everywhere.

195
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Clowns everywhere.

196
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:27,000
But we were watching it on our own channel and I saw people going, is it Silent Hill?

197
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Like what is this going on here?

198
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,000
And I was like, well, that would be a twist if there's a Silent Hill game on the Xbox.

199
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
But no, it's the Blair Witch thing.

200
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
But that's cool.

201
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Like I, you know, say what you want about where that franchise ended up.

202
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:48,000
When that movie first came out, if you're too young to remember, when that movie first came out, that movie mind fucked people in the biggest way.

203
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Because the internet wasn't like everywhere yet.

204
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
So not everybody knew that that movie was fake.

205
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
And they really tried to sell it off as real.

206
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Like that was the first like found footage horror movie.

207
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Not the, but the first that took off the way it did.

208
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
You know what I mean?

209
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
So it's interesting to see them revisit that I think.

210
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
So pretty cool.

211
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Anyway, after the Blair Witch was Cyberpunk 2077 and all the footage.

212
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Which looks amazing.

213
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Yeah, you know, I haven't been following the Cyberpunk stuff super closely.

214
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:21,000
But you know, you can definitely tell a lot of that cinematography from what you'd see with The Witcher.

215
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:27,000
You know, and a lot of the really amazing graphical style you can see comes into play with that.

216
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
And it looked really good.

217
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
It was announced for a release in 2020.

218
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
So it's not going to happen this year.

219
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:38,000
But hopefully with the 2020 release, we're not talking about crunch time or any of that stuff.

220
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:43,000
But what made me happy was the little footage of Keanu Reeves at the end.

221
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Which I think made a lot of people go, whoa.

222
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Because I don't think people knew that was coming, right?

223
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
So we got to see the Keanu Reeves.

224
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
And then out from backstage, Keanu Reeves.

225
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
He's there and he does his little spiel.

226
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
He's being very Keanu Reeves.

227
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
He's very endearing.

228
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
The audience loves him.

229
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
He gets heckled.

230
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,000
But in the most Sesame Street kind of way.

231
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Where somebody from the audience says, you're breathtaking.

232
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
And Keanu goes, no, you're breathtaking.

233
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,000
And it's just like the loveliest verbal pillow fight you've ever seen.

234
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
It was a very pure wholesome E3 moment.

235
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Which we don't usually get enough of.

236
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,000
So yeah, I was not expecting that with Cyberpunk 2077.

237
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,000
But it did look, it looks like a pretty compelling game.

238
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
So I'm sure a lot of people are going to be very into that.

239
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Let's see, moving on.

240
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Actually going to a question here.

241
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Black Mamba 1977 in chat says, do you think they'll ever make an Alan Wake game that's multi-platform?

242
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I miss that game but don't want to get a new Xbox.

243
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
No hate to the console.

244
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
The Xbox hasn't been kind to me console wise.

245
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Well also one thing to keep in mind.

246
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I don't know if it would go to PlayStation.

247
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
But it'll go to PC.

248
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
If you have a PC that's strong enough to play it.

249
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Is what I would say today.

250
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
But this whole xCloud thing of the future.

251
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
They didn't get into that too much.

252
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,000
No, it seems like it's more of just like kind of like remote play.

253
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Like how that was with.

254
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,000
But then they also said that it's either your console or it's the cloud.

255
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
I think, not to get too ahead of ourselves.

256
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:17,000
But I think the reason, my guess for that is that if you have a Project Scarlett console.

257
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,000
It's going to render everything and do all that stuff in real time and all that good stuff.

258
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
But if you don't have a Project Scarlett console, you have an Xbox One console.

259
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:29,000
You use the cloud thing to play the game on the Xbox One console.

260
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
And it's their processing power but it's on your Xbox One.

261
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
So what they're probably going to say is you can buy this new console.

262
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Or you can just keep your original console and play these new games.

263
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
But you'll have to be connected to the internet to play these new games.

264
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:45,000
And I would imagine that the Xbox One will be able to read those discs somehow.

265
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
So it will still know you have a copy of that game in there.

266
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Because that would be kind of interesting, wouldn't it?

267
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,000
That if you're paying for a game and it's a disc that will work on a Project Scarlett.

268
00:13:54,000 --> 00:14:01,000
But if you put it in an Xbox One, it unlocks the game on xCloud for you to play while the disc is in there.

269
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Which is how backwards compatibility kind of works today.

270
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,000
You're not playing it in the cloud, but you still have to have your 360 disc in the Xbox One.

271
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
That unlocks what you're playing a digital copy of the game.

272
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Kind of like that, I think.

273
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Any thoughts?

274
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
I don't know if that's how it's going to work, but we'll see.

275
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
There's still a lot to be explained there, that's for sure.

276
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Other games. Spiritfarer, which looked kind of cute and artsy.

277
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,000
It looked a little mobile to me, but I'd be curious about more.

278
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Because it looked kind of like a building game and so forth.

279
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
And then Battletoads showed up.

280
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
So finally we got to see what Battletoads actually looks like in motion.

281
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
They're going for a very cartoony style.

282
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Not like Cuphead cartoony, but very like, you know...

283
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Modern DuckTales or...

284
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,000
DuckTales or Castle Crashers. It looked a lot like Castle Crashers to me, but like Battletoads.

285
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,000
So that kind of made me go, is this a $60 game?

286
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Because this looks like Castle Crashers, which was like a $20 game.

287
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:00,000
So I'm not sure we saw enough of Battletoads if it's going to be a full game.

288
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,000
But at the same time, and this is something important we have to keep in the back of our heads.

289
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Microsoft doesn't necessarily always want us thinking about, it's a $20 game, it's a $60 game.

290
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Microsoft wants you thinking about, I get to play this with my Game Pass subscription.

291
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Exactly.

292
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:24,000
So maybe this whole, is it $20? Maybe that whole debate is going to be a thing of the past before too long.

293
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
I don't know. Anyway.

294
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Let's see, what else? After Battletoads was the...

295
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
They got into RPG Time, The Legend of Right.

296
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
That was like the notepad sketch looking game that looks like...

297
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Yeah, it looked pretty cool.

298
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Yeah, it looked complicated. There was a lot of stuff going on in that UI.

299
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,000
It was a messy UI, but I'm sure the game walks you through it a little bit.

300
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
So I would like to know more.

301
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
ID at Xbox, where they kind of rapid fire went through...

302
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,000
This is how they get 60 games at you. They rapid fire go through the indie games that are being developed.

303
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:00,000
I didn't catch them all. I only caught the one that was called Supermarket Shriek, because that made me laugh.

304
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Yeah, that's the one with the goat. I remember that.

305
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Yes, that one made me laugh.

306
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,000
And then they talked about Xbox Game Pass for a little bit.

307
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:16,000
They talked about Xbox Game Pass on PC, which I have to be honest, the games that they were spotlighting for Xbox games on PC didn't exactly make me go,

308
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:21,000
but I think they were trying to pick things that maybe don't exist on Xbox One.

309
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Does Football Manager 19, is that something you can play on your Xbox One? I don't think it is.

310
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
I don't know.

311
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:32,000
So I think they were trying to maybe pick things that were kind of PC specific, but then there's a lot of overlap with the Xbox One.

312
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:39,000
But then they showed that, they reiterated the Xbox One version, and then they came out and said,

313
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:45,000
we're going to offer you this Xbox Ultimate Pass for $14.99.

314
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:55,000
We're going to have an Xbox Pass that is the Xbox Game Pass for the system, for the PC, and Xbox Gold for $14.99 a month.

315
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
And even you asked this when you came in here tonight, and I think a lot of people have been asking,

316
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:05,000
well, we knew Microsoft was looking at doing this bundle, but isn't $14.99 the cost of just Game Pass today and Gold?

317
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Yes. So now what they did to sweeten the pot is that they're throwing in PC Game Pass, which as I understand is still separate,

318
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
is part of that $14.99.

319
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
I've got to admit, I think I'm going to do it.

320
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:23,000
And I heard something about that it's actually a dollar a month promotional pricing if you still have an active Xbox Gold.

321
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Because right now I'm paid through February on my Xbox plan.

322
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Because you buy that annually, right?

323
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
So I heard something about you get a dollar a month.

324
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Don't quote me on this. I haven't read all the terms and conditions, but at least you get a little bit of a dollar a month for a little bit of that.

325
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,000
And I've got to admit, I think I'm going to do it.

326
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Why not?

327
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:50,000
There's a lot of games that I'm spending $60 on when they come out, like Forza Horizon and stuff, that I think I just would sign up for the Game Pass.

328
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
I'm playing that way, to be honest.

329
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
So, anyway.

330
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Let's see, I'm looking in our chat here for some other comments.

331
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Tigerclaw does point out, as far as Battletoads goes, it did show new speeder bike levels.

332
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Sure, it did. And yeah, I remember how those levels were notorious.

333
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Sure, instead of like a third person, though, it was like a first person.

334
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:16,000
No, it was still third person, but it was just instead of being side scrolling, it was going into...

335
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Oh yeah, it was more like over the shoulder.

336
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah. For sure.

337
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
It can be less annoying.

338
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Let's see, and then they showed a new flight simulator.

339
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:31,000
They showed Microsoft Flight Simulator, which again, not a series you always associate with Xbox.

340
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:36,000
I think those flight simulator games were always very PC-centric, but it looked gorgeous.

341
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
It really looked good.

342
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,000
And I was just sitting there the whole time going, but I'm not good at the simulator part.

343
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Can I just press F to fly?

344
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,000
And apparently Bobby Blackwell says yes, there is a Bobby Blackwell mode in flight simulator.

345
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,000
So you can just fly the damn plane and enjoy the scenery, which I think will be lovely.

346
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:59,000
And again, if that's a part of Game Pass, for me, I'm like, okay, I wouldn't have thought of dropping $60 on flight simulator,

347
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
but like pay in the 15 a month.

348
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Does it have a VR mode? Because that would be awesome.

349
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Interesting enough, VR AR completely left out of Microsoft's conversation today.

350
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
It's just, you know, we talked a little bit about this at the end of Bobby's show.

351
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:15,000
It's just not something they're doing with Xbox right now, it seems.

352
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:20,000
But, you know, had Sony gone to E3 this year, I'm sure VR would have been a part of their conversation.

353
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:25,000
So it is just an interesting little unique difference between the two consoles right now is that, you know,

354
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Microsoft is really focusing on this games and PC and Xbox are their platforms,

355
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:35,000
whereas Sony is looking at games with PlayStation and VR enhanced is kind of their world right now.

356
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:39,000
So you're kind of starting to see a little more of a division between those two, for sure.

357
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:46,000
So after flight simulator was the new Age of Empires game, Age of Empires II, which I have to admit, I don't get it.

358
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,000
As into those games I do Civ, but I know those games have their fans, so I'm sure they were very happy.

359
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Wasteland 3 was shown as well, which, again, not a series I've gotten into yet,

360
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
but I thought they did a good job with the trailer.

361
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,000
I'm trying to pick up the pace a little bit here because I have a lot to get through.

362
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Big shoe dropping, Double Fine acquired by Xbox.

363
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,000
As if all of their acquisitions last year weren't enough, they came out and said,

364
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,000
not only did we acquire all of them, we got one more, Double Fine.

365
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Some pressed people on my Twitter feed about that, not happy about that one.

366
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:22,000
But I have to admit, I'm trying to come from that perspective of, to me,

367
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:29,000
it's because the reason why a lot of people are oppressed is because the Double Fine fans, some that I know, are like,

368
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:34,000
dang it, I like Psychonauts, I like those games, those are the types of games I want to play,

369
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:40,000
I don't want to have to go to freaking Xbox, I don't like Xbox because they don't have my kind of games.

370
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Well, y'all, that's why Microsoft did it.

371
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Microsoft's trying to win those people over because you don't like Microsoft

372
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
because they don't have those kind of games. Well, guess what?

373
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
They just bought to get those kind of games.

374
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
That's their strategy.

375
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Maybe on PC too, I'm sure.

376
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Yeah, and I'm sure a lot of folks will enjoy Psychonauts 2 on PC and so forth,

377
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:06,000
which is also interesting that Psychonauts 2 is now so closely related with Microsoft

378
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:11,000
when the first one didn't go so well, because the first one was supposed to be an Xbox exclusive.

379
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:19,000
But also, I think we know the folks that are running Xbox completely different from what it used to be.

380
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
I mean, props to Phil Spencer, am I right?

381
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Phil Spencer has turned the Xbox One ship around.

382
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
He should really be commended, so good job, Phil Spencer.

383
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Especially considering to who they used to have.

384
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
I mean, he's been miles and light years beyond.

385
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
I feel like Phil Spencer gets it.

386
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Phil Spencer is like a gamer, whereas the last guy was an executive, you know what I mean?

387
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
So, kudos to Phil Spencer, honestly.

388
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Let's see.

389
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Going on to more games.

390
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,000
The Lego Star Wars Skywalker Saga.

391
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
All nine games in one.

392
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,000
But it's not like a compilation. It's a brand new game.

393
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
No, it's a brand new game. It's all nine movies in one.

394
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Yeah, that'd be cool.

395
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
That seems a little cluster fucky to me, but

396
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Lego has their unique sense of humor and their unique way of doing things.

397
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
I'm sure it'll be fine.

398
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Yeah, it'll be fine.

399
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Yeah, it'll be fine.

400
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,000
And then they showed the Project Z, the Dragon Ball Z Kakarot.

401
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
I don't know if I said that right. Sorry, guys.

402
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,000
I don't really play a lot of the Dragon Ball Z stuff,

403
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,000
but I think it's cool that Microsoft is showcasing something like that

404
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,000
because that, again, is the type of game that you don't always associate with Microsoft,

405
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,000
but here they are giving a pretty decent chunk of time to it, so I thought that was very interesting.

406
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,000
So, from a strategical perspective, I was kind of into that.

407
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,000
And then after that, they showed, actually, the game that really...

408
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
This was one of the standouts for me.

409
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
12 Minutes was the game after that.

410
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
It's an Annapurna Studios game.

411
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
It was a time loop thriller game.

412
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,000
So, she was like, oh, I got you a present, and he goes,

413
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,000
I already know what's in the box, and you killed your dad,

414
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000
and a guy's coming through that door, and it was very scary.

415
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Which time loops are all the rage right now. Have you seen Russian Dolls?

416
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,000
There was another game during the Bethesda conference that's also based around a time loop.

417
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Oh, what did they...

418
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
It's called Deathloop.

419
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Oh, so another time... Time loops are in. Time loops are the new battle royale.

420
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Where's my time loop, Fallout 76?

421
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Be careful. Be careful what you wish for.

422
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Alright, and then they showed a game called Way to the Woods,

423
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:18,000
which, like, you played as this moose that was using their antlers to, like, smash windows and things,

424
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:23,000
and I was reminded of Tokyo Jungle randomly, but the art style was very different and very cool.

425
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:27,000
But I also won a sequel to Tokyo Jungle, so PlayStation 5 made that happen.

426
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,000
And then they got into the Gears Pop mobile game, right?

427
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Cute.

428
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:39,000
State of Decay 2, which I see another zombie game and my eyes kind of glaze over.

429
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Well, it's State of Decay 2, I think it's an expansion to that.

430
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Yeah, but I see another zombie, my eyes glaze over, but I thought it was a well-done trailer.

431
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,000
It looked interesting. I was like, okay, this looks like it might be interesting.

432
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:55,000
And then they show Phantasy Star Online 2, and I melted, I died, I was resurrected.

433
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:01,000
No, there's a part of me, like, don't get me wrong, I am really excited about Phantasy Star Online 2 happening,

434
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:10,000
but I've hit that it's been so long, I kind of go, well, what are they going to do to, like, A, catch up, B,

435
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:16,000
a lot of people have already visited Phantasy Star Online 2, how are they going to make this now a game for 2019?

436
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
That's kind of what I'm curious about, you know what I mean?

437
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Yeah.

438
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Or are they just going to kind of rest on their laurels and hope that we kind of eat up what they've delivered seven years ago in another country?

439
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:33,000
But I'm really excited to check it out for sure, so don't get me wrong, I'm just like, it's kind of like one of those sighs of relief,

440
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,000
like, finally, this is happening, I just hope it's done well.

441
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:41,000
I was kind of surprised it didn't, I would have thought if Phantasy Star Online 2 was going to happen,

442
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:47,000
I'm surprised it wasn't a Nintendo Switch thing, which, yes, I know the Switch does the whole cloud gaming thing,

443
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:53,000
but still, it's on the Switch overseas, it's on PlayStation overseas, I'm kind of surprised now it's Xbox over here,

444
00:24:53,000 --> 00:25:01,000
that alone is interesting in how it changes the conversation, but it should be noted, Phantasy Star Universe,

445
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:05,000
which a lot of y'all slept on, you didn't like it as much as Phantasy Star Online, I thought it was alright,

446
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Phantasy Star Universe was an Xbox 360 game, Phantasy Star Universe was not PlayStation, Phantasy Star Universe was not Nintendo's platform,

447
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:16,000
so Microsoft does have a precedent of supporting the series, there is that.

448
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:22,000
After that, they hyped this series that I guess tons of people around the world play,

449
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:26,000
and I have to note, I didn't, Crossfire X, I didn't...

450
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
It's in Korea, I think.

451
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Okay, that's, I'm like, it has to be a game overseas that's huge, and remember,

452
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Microsoft does business in many other places than just North America, so I'm sure they had...

453
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:43,000
I forget where it's from, it's either China or Korea, and it's basically of the size of Fortnite over there.

454
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Bobby says it's Korea's Counter-Strike.

455
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Counter-Strike, yeah.

456
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Yeah, basically.

457
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:54,000
So, let's see, and then after that was Tales of Arise, so Tales of Symphonia, Tales of...

458
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:59,000
So it's like Namco, Bandai's JRPG, looks really nice, actually, the art style looks really cool,

459
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:03,000
and I'm always glad to see RPGs on Xbox, that's a great thing.

460
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Then they show Borderlands 3, which I'm sure you have more opinions on.

461
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Yeah, it looks good, I mean, it's a kind of similar trailer, except I did laugh when, you know,

462
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Claptrap is trying to chase after the gun with legs and it runs up the stairs,

463
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,000
because that's, you know, his greatest weakness, his stairs.

464
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Yeah.

465
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
He's like, no!

466
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
And it's hilarious.

467
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Did you think it was interesting how they would bleep words, because they bleeped Claptrap in that,

468
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,000
and they bleeped a lot of stuff in the Cyberpunk 2077?

469
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:34,000
It's only in that broadcast, because I think it's family-friendly and it goes on the Xbox as well,

470
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:38,000
but if you actually watch the trailer outside of that, like, I would rewatch the Cyberpunk trailer,

471
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
and it's not.

472
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
It's just...

473
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,000
But what was, okay, but, like, family-friendly, did you see all that violence,

474
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
and did you catch the finger in the Cyberpunk thing?

475
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Like, I wouldn't say it was family-friendly, they just bleeped the language, which I thought was weird.

476
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Well, some people are more offended by language than blood.

477
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Okay, there's a whole commentary just waiting in there, but I'm gonna leave it at that,

478
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:02,000
because it's a three-hour show, we don't have enough time if I get on that tangent.

479
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:07,000
So, the next game that they showed was Elden Ring,

480
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:12,000
and this is the big Miyazaki and R.R. Martin, George R.R. Martin coming together.

481
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Lots of people will die.

482
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Yes, lots of people, your faves will be killed.

483
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:22,000
But the trailer was very cinematic, of course, no actual game to be seen there,

484
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,000
but I'm sure that's not gonna stop the hype machine for a lot of people.

485
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
It looks good, I don't know what it is.

486
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Yeah, I know, I'm curious to hear more, but it's very early on right now.

487
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:37,000
And then, after that, the rest of the time was spent on the new console.

488
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
So, not everybody was expecting this.

489
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Did we talk about the Forza Horizon Lego thing?

490
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Oh, I skipped over it, I'm sorry, you're right.

491
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Forza, how could I miss that, Bobby?

492
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Forza Horizon 4's Lego expansion, yeah, looks great.

493
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Which comes out this week.

494
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
Yeah, and it's like right now, too.

495
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
I was saying they could make a whole other game out of that.

496
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
They should.

497
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Honestly, I'm kind of surprised.

498
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,000
It's kind of interesting because where it's like Battletoads is one of those,

499
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,000
like, oh, they're gonna maybe charge full price for this game

500
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,000
that may be more like an online thing.

501
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:11,000
They could probably get away with doing a whole Lego spin-off Horizon game themselves

502
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:15,000
and get away with it, but no, it's DLC.

503
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Anything else I missed?

504
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,000
No, I think that was it.

505
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Yeah, Bobby Blackwolf pointing out, after all the how dare yous,

506
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,000
we also thought Hot Wheels could have been its own game.

507
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:34,000
And SSG100Matt over at twitch.tv slash vlog network says, Lego, all the things.

508
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Yes, there was a lot of Lego in that Crest Commons, wasn't there?

509
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:41,000
What I really liked in that trailer, obviously it looks great,

510
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,000
but I really like that remix of Everything is Awesome

511
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
that sounded like a song you would hear in Forza Horizon.

512
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:50,000
It was like a Eurotrance type of version of that song.

513
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
It was awesome.

514
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
Then we got into the new console,

515
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:57,000
which they did not give a further name to beyond Project Scarlet,

516
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
which obviously will not be the final name,

517
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
but they're still referring to it as Project Scarlet.

518
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:06,000
And we had a little talking head piece about people hyping up the console.

519
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Very interesting in that talking head piece that we ticked all the boxes

520
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
that Sony has ticked so far.

521
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,000
And they're tiny, tiny little, hey, we invited somebody into our office

522
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,000
before they did a leak story on this.

523
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:22,000
So the SSD drive, check, Microsoft's doing it too.

524
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
GDDR6 RAM.

525
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Ray tracing, all that stuff checked off.

526
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Zen 2 architecture.

527
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
So Microsoft level set.

528
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
What Sony's doing, we're doing.

529
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
So we're on the same page.

530
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Now Microsoft took it one step further by showing you

531
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
here's what ray tracing looks like.

532
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,000
And we got maybe 30 seconds of glimpse

533
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,000
at these random things that were running.

534
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:50,000
I remember a scenery shot of these wildlife in an environmental thing,

535
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
and it kind of showed the ray tracing in action.

536
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Looked really nice, right?

537
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
So we got those little glimpses.

538
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:59,000
And then, of course, a big glimpse at Halo Infinite,

539
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:02,000
which is going to be their big kickoff title,

540
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:06,000
taking a page from the original Xbox and launching with a Halo game.

541
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
Have a good strong title to launch the system with.

542
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:12,000
Or one might say taking a page from Nintendo,

543
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,000
who launched the Switch with Breath of the Wild.

544
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Because Halo Infinite, I mean, Microsoft has said before,

545
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,000
am I right?

546
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:25,000
You can play any game they announce from now on on your Xbox One, right?

547
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Because it's probably going to be this whole cloud thing.

548
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:30,000
So Halo Infinite will be for the past console,

549
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
but it's also going to be the kickoff for the new console.

550
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Yeah.

551
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
And it will...

552
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:40,000
I mean, it wasn't very Halo-y, what we saw, but it was well done.

553
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
Yeah.

554
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Especially that scene when the little princess Leia hologram type thing was coming in.

555
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Just look at the detail on that.

556
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
It looked really amazingly detailed on that whole thing.

557
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
Yeah.

558
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
So that was good.

559
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
And then, of course, you do see the Master Chief,

560
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,000
and you saw what I thought was going to be the tutorial.

561
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
I thought it was going to suddenly take over,

562
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,000
because it was a good setup for now that we've got you plugged in,

563
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
let's make sure you're working again.

564
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Look over here.

565
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Use RS to move.

566
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
Now look over here.

567
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Well, it could be in the game.

568
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,000
But maybe it jumped a few steps ahead.

569
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
I don't know.

570
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:17,000
But yeah, that was pretty hot, that Halo Infinite look.

571
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
So that was everything for Microsoft.

572
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
I know I talked a lot about that, but there was a lot to digest.

573
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:25,000
So overall, you thought it was pretty good.

574
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
I thought it was pretty good too.

575
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Yeah, I think they did a good job.

576
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,000
I think they did too.

577
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
I don't think they did anything that was like,

578
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:34,000
oh shit, Sony's going to regret not coming this year.

579
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:39,000
There wasn't a lot of, I think, unexpected titles from them.

580
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:43,000
It was kind of like showing you some more stuff that we've seen already.

581
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
I mean, we've already seen a lot of those.

582
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
It's not like brand new, like this is a...

583
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
Fantasy Star Online 2 was unexpected.

584
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:53,000
It was unexpected, but it wasn't something from what our studios are working on,

585
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
exclusive games for us type of thing.

586
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,000
It wasn't anything like that.

587
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
But it was fine.

588
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,000
It was all right.

589
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Yeah, I thought they did a very good message of games, games, games, games, games.

590
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
They really did show a lot,

591
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,000
and especially for what is essentially a lame duck year

592
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
for the current gen consoles, right?

593
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
That's what you call, you know,

594
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
well, we all know there's a new gen coming,

595
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
so this is the last year,

596
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
and this is why Sony's kind of taken it off,

597
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
because if Sony showed up to E3 this year,

598
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
what would they be showing?

599
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,000
Death Stranding, which they've shown a bunch of already.

600
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,000
Last of Us 2.

601
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Last of Us 2, which they showed a lot of last year.

602
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
And the year before that.

603
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
Yeah, they would show Final Fantasy 7 Remake,

604
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,000
which they've already shown on Square.

605
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,000
It's got their own thing anyway.

606
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Tomorrow, yeah.

607
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:35,000
So I just think Sony, maybe their bridge games,

608
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
they already milked the hype out of those.

609
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:40,000
I'm surprised we didn't see more Call of Duty Modern Warfare,

610
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
because you know how they kind of do those like,

611
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
you know, hey, let's show some of this person,

612
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,000
third party company's game, or something like that.

613
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:52,000
Or, well, I guess Assassin's Creed will see that in Ubisoft.

614
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:56,000
Well, yeah, what were you surprised was not there?

615
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:00,000
I don't really have any expectations,

616
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
so I guess not really anything.

617
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,000
That's true, lower them expectations, right?

618
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
I guess I would say the VR AR thing,

619
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:08,000
just the fact that they didn't address it at all,

620
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,000
is an interesting thing.

621
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
It does definitely show you here's Microsoft,

622
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:14,000
where they're at, versus here's where Sony's at.

623
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
I would have liked to have seen some download content

624
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,000
for Crackdown 3, because I really have no reason

625
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,000
to play that game again.

626
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,000
And I'm kind of sad that it's just like was so short

627
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
and kind of meh.

628
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Top three out of that whole event.

629
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,000
I'll do mine.

630
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Top three, PSO2, hello.

631
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:36,000
12 minutes, and the 1499 Ultimate Xbox Pass thing.

632
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:40,000
I think that's, and especially considering

633
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,000
what we're going to talk about next,

634
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:44,000
I think Xbox got me on that.

635
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
But what about your top three?

636
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:53,000
Cyberpunk 2077, Outer Worlds, and I'd say Borderlands 3.

637
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
Good picks, solid picks.

638
00:33:55,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Let's see, Bobby wants to, I guess, reiterate something

639
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
he said on Twitter.

640
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
Oh, wow, Scarlet News.

641
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
I made a tweet during the conference about wanting

642
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:08,000
to still play 4K Blu-rays and 4K Netflix on Scarlet

643
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
so it could just replace my Xbox One X.

644
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,000
A Microsoft dev lead that works on xCloud

645
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:17,000
and the display app replied to me during my show saying,

646
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:22,000
all good, so 4K UHD Blu-ray player for Scarlet confirmed?

647
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
Question, question.

648
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Hooray.

649
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,000
I would think that's the kind of thing

650
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
Microsoft doesn't want to confirm right now,

651
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:31,000
because Microsoft has set the precedent a little bit

652
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
that they're willing to go all digital.

653
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:38,000
So maybe they'll be different versions of Scarlet.

654
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
Maybe one of them will play Blu-rays

655
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
because that licensing fee and all that, right?

656
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
And maybe one of them won't.

657
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:48,000
You know, theorizing, fantasizing, we'll see, right?

658
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
We'll see.

659
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
I don't know.

660
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:54,000
Bobby Black Wolf also noting Forza Motorsport 8

661
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
as a noticeable thing that wasn't there

662
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,000
that was surprising.

663
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:00,000
Yeah, you know, you would expect a new Forza game

664
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
on the, what, odd number years

665
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,000
and a Horizon game on the even number years at this point.

666
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:08,000
But I think if we know that a new console is coming in 2020,

667
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,000
if those rumors are true that Turn 10,

668
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
which I know is Horizon's, folks,

669
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:19,000
but if they're working on a RPG type of thing and all this,

670
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:23,000
if all that's true, then maybe Forza's just taken the year off.

671
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,000
Probably.

672
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:28,000
What I would imagine is going to be, I mean, hello,

673
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,000
ray tracing and top-of-the-line graphics,

674
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:34,000
that's just begging for Scarlet, the new console.

675
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
So I think they're just sitting on Motorsport 8

676
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
for the new console, I think.

677
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,000
Oh, I'm sorry, playground games, not Turn 10.

678
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,000
My bad.

679
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,000
I got them backwards, as people often do.

680
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
All right, let's see.

681
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,000
So let's, I guess let's move on, shall we?

682
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:52,000
Let's get to what else happened during E3 week.

683
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
The EA Play event also happened.

684
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
So we had Microsoft's event, we had EA Play.

685
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
Did you watch EA Play?

686
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,000
I only caught the part with Star Wars in it

687
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
because I could care less,

688
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,000
I couldn't care less about the sports stuff,

689
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:11,000
and I don't play Apex Legends, so I think that was basically it.

690
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
I didn't catch it, it was just a bad time for me

691
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:16,000
because we had Sacramento Pride going on this weekend,

692
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
and I was hanging out with friends yesterday for that,

693
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
so I just missed the whole thing.

694
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
And kind of similar thought, I was like, eh,

695
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
I mean, if they announce a new Dragon Age or something,

696
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
I'll see a trailer about that later on.

697
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,000
They didn't, so we didn't miss any of that.

698
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:33,000
Here's what they did recap at EA Play for E3 2019.

699
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
They pretty much focused on six games,

700
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
including Star Wars Jedi Fallen Order.

701
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
They did the first 15 minutes of gameplay,

702
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:43,000
and that's all, of course, available on YouTube now in the archives,

703
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
if you want to check that out.

704
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,000
They did show more Apex Legends.

705
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,000
There's a new character that they unveiled, Watson.

706
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
And there's a new short to go with it,

707
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
kind of like when they announce a new Overwatch character.

708
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
Yeah, kind of cute the way they did that,

709
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,000
but I think people responding very positively to Watson,

710
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:02,000
the character, it's bringing a nice new kit for the game.

711
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:06,000
Also a new weapon from Titanfall 2 that crossed over in Apex Legends,

712
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
so you're seeing a little bit more of that universe starting to come together.

713
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
Unless that weapon is Titans, I don't really care.

714
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
I can't remember what you wish for.

715
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
And then a ranked mode coming to Apex as well,

716
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,000
which I'm sure surprises nobody, right? Yeah.

717
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
They showed Battlefield V.

718
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
They showed some new maps.

719
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:25,000
The Battle of Greece, North Africa map.

720
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
There's a classic Battlefield map.

721
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:30,000
Oh, the North Africa Al-Sudan is a classic map

722
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,000
that mixes up foot, vehicles, and air combat mode.

723
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
So, okay.

724
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
And then they showed more Star Wars Battlefront II,

725
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
just a little bit.

726
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Obviously, this game's been out for a while,

727
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
but they did want to point out that Naboo,

728
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,000
a capital supremacy map, is coming on June 26th,

729
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:49,000
and there's also the Droideka and the TX-30 tank.

730
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
Then they talked a little bit about FIFA 20,

731
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
because, of course, EA's got to cover sports,

732
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:56,000
and despite however you might feel about FIFA,

733
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
it's like the biggest game in the world.

734
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,000
So they had to talk about FIFA 20, and they did that a little bit.

735
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:05,000
And Volta is a new mode inside FIFA 20.

736
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
It's street-style soccer.

737
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
So street soccer, which I have never seen.

738
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
They've had FIFA Street, so it makes sense.

739
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
I've never seen played here in the States,

740
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:16,000
but obviously it's a little more worldwide

741
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,000
when we're talking about FIFA.

742
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:23,000
Madden 20, because, again, they have to show the sports games,

743
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:26,000
and Madden's one of them, so they showed a little bit of that.

744
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,000
And The Sims 4 is getting a new expansion.

745
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:33,000
Island Living is the new expansion for Sims 4,

746
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:37,000
which is still going as we come up on the 20th year of The Sims.

747
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
And I was pretty pleasantly surprised

748
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:42,000
that Sims 4 is still trucking along with all the content.

749
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
And I've got to admit, I haven't been following the series so closely,

750
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,000
but I know people that do that were excited to hear

751
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
that there is still more content coming for the game.

752
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
That's pretty cool.

753
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:54,000
So that, in a nutshell, was EA Play.

754
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
So I guess...

755
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
Favorites there? Star Wars, the only thing I saw.

756
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Yeah, and honestly, well, I like Apex enough.

757
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
I need to play it more. I need to give it a better shot.

758
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,000
So I like that Apex is still trucking along

759
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
and that they're doing animated shorts with it.

760
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
I think that's pretty cool.

761
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:16,000
Alright, let's move on and talk about the Pokemon Direct.

762
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
I'm sure you were excited about this, right?

763
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
I didn't watch it.

764
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
I watched kind of like the highlights.

765
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,000
It was on too fucking early to watch it live.

766
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:28,000
So of course you get all the highlights on Twitter, right?

767
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:32,000
So we got to see things like the new Pokemon they announced,

768
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:35,000
such as Wooloo, who is a sheep

769
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:39,000
and everybody on my Twitter feed seems to be standing Wooloo,

770
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
because Wooloo is an adorable little sheep Pokemon.

771
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:44,000
Mareep is crying that you've all forgotten Mareep already.

772
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:47,000
Wooloo shipping immediately. It was just ridiculous.

773
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:50,000
It's like a goddamn sheep, folks.

774
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
Gossifleur was another Pokemon.

775
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,000
Drednaw. Corviknight, which was kind of a cool little

776
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:58,000
badass raven knight looking thing.

777
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
Eldegoss was another one as well.

778
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
The Wild Area.

779
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,000
A Wild Area is an area that stretches between cities

780
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
and different Pokemon appear depending on where you are

781
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
and what the weather is like.

782
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:13,000
You have full 360 degree control over the cameras.

783
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:16,000
That's a little different than Pokemon games of the past.

784
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
So now it's a little more of a 3D environment.

785
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Breath of the Pokemon.

786
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
I don't know if I go that far, but certainly...

787
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:25,000
Can I light fire to the tall grass?

788
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
Yeah, it's going to be a big change.

789
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:32,000
Dynamaxing, which some people don't feel so hot about.

790
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:35,000
Make my monster grow!

791
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:38,000
You can make your Pokemon do maximum capabilities,

792
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
max moves.

793
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,000
You can use it once in a battle and it lasts for three turns.

794
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
So this is going to be, you know,

795
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:48,000
when do you do it and all this is going to be key.

796
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
They do not call this an evolution.

797
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:53,000
They don't want to confuse it with Z-moves and make evolutions.

798
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:56,000
Dynamax. It's the new thing.

799
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:59,000
Kind of sounds like a weight gain drug, so I guess it's all good.

800
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
Max raid battles. This sounded kind of cool

801
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
because it sounded like a Pokemon Go kind of thing

802
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:06,000
that they took and they're putting in the mainline games now

803
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:10,000
because it's a multiplayer event and what you do in the wild area,

804
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
different Dynamax Pokemon.

805
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
And again, I think that's kind of clever because if you think about it,

806
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
that's how it works in Pokemon Go, right?

807
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,000
You have these supercharged Pokemon that you battle at the raid gyms

808
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
and then they come down in size for you to catch.

809
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:25,000
So in some ways, maybe you can blame Pokemon Go for your Dynamax Pokemon.

810
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
I don't know. I don't know.

811
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:31,000
But anyway, you basically come together and you do a party of four

812
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:34,000
and the Pokemon stays in the Dynamax form

813
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:37,000
and so you all basically fight this Pokemon together.

814
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
I believe I heard things about NPCs

815
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
if you don't have the friends to play with or what have you.

816
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
So that sounds kind of neat, though.

817
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
It's a neat little different co-op angle

818
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:49,000
and I think it's really cool that you see how Pokemon Go's influence now.

819
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
And then also kind of like with Let's Go,

820
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:54,000
they also have it where you can see the Pokemon on the map

821
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
instead of just running into them randomly.

822
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
Yeah. And then let's see.

823
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,000
New characters, new gyms.

824
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
They showed a character named Leon,

825
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:07,000
a burly blue-haired man that is apparently a celebrity, of course,

826
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:10,000
and has Charizard following in a lot of places.

827
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:13,000
So they showed several characters and there's already,

828
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:16,000
like Milo was one of the characters, a grass-type gym leader,

829
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:20,000
and I've already seen fan art for Milo that I can't unsee.

830
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:23,000
You don't follow the same Twitter accounts I do.

831
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:26,000
Hi, Loki. I've seen things.

832
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
Then they, of course, announced the release date.

833
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:35,000
November 15th, 2019 is the global release day

834
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
and they showed the mythical Pokemon.

835
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
I'm probably going to mispronounce these, sorry.

836
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:43,000
Zacian and Zamazenta were shown there

837
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:46,000
and they were shown in a little fight, fighting each other.

838
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
I liked Zamazenta a little better

839
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
because it actually has the shield face

840
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
and I just thought the color scheme was a little...

841
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:55,000
Yeah, so I think I might be a little more Pokemon Shield,

842
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:58,000
but I want to hear a little closer to the date

843
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:01,000
all the Pokemon that are exclusive in one game versus the other

844
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
because I'm sure there will be a bit of a list,

845
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:06,000
but I'm sure lots of people are going to be picking up this game,

846
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
both types.

847
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:12,000
And knowing my buddy Shane, who I saw in chat already,

848
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:15,000
he's probably going to buy 17 copies of the game anyway,

849
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:18,000
so I won't have a problem trading for whatever Pokemon I need.

850
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:21,000
And he's already correcting me. Legendary, not mythical, my bad.

851
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
I thought I said legendary,

852
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:26,000
but there's just so many Pokemon to be excited about.

853
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
So, you're not showing...

854
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
More excitement about Pokemon, Loki.

855
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,000
Are you going to pick it up?

856
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,000
Maybe, I don't know.

857
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,000
I will, for sure.

858
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
I'm excited about a mainline game on the Switch.

859
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,000
I really am.

860
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
I haven't played any of the mainline games, so I don't know.

861
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
Really? You should fix that.

862
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
Alright.

863
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
S2100matt in chat says,

864
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
The dual pack with both games is a lame deal.

865
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
120 for both games.

866
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
You get better deals if you buy them individually from retailers.

867
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:53,000
Some are offering $10 credit for pre-ordering.

868
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:56,000
Shad Starzik or Shane in our chat is following that up,

869
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,000
saying they will probably add something to sweeten the deal,

870
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:02,000
like bonus items in game or something.

871
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,000
Maybe a Steelbook.

872
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,000
Yeah.

873
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,000
Or a shiny...

874
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,000
What do you want to bet?

875
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,000
Get shiny Pikachu...

876
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
I don't know, I'm pulling some dumb ass.

877
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,000
Get shiny XYZ...

878
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:14,000
Shiny Wooloo for buying the combo kit or something like that.

879
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
Maybe that'll be a thing.

880
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:19,000
Somebody's going to be mad I spoke that into existence, but sorry.

881
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
Mistake Theory says,

882
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:24,000
I always get the second game, so I'm in for shield.

883
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
That's an interesting way to do it.

884
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
Always get the second game listed.

885
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,000
So red and blue.

886
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,000
X and Y.

887
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
Kind of an interesting way to do it. I like that.

888
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,000
Alright.

889
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
Let's move on to Stadia.

890
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,000
Let's talk about Google Stadia.

891
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,000
You want to talk about Stadia, Loki?

892
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
I know you've been keeping an ear on the Bethesda thing,

893
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,000
but they just finished, right?

894
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,000
Yeah.

895
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
I didn't really watch the Stadia event.

896
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
I just read the press stuff.

897
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:48,000
So basically they talked a little bit about the service

898
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:51,000
and everything, what the requirements would be, and pricing, all that stuff.

899
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
So Stadia is going to launch in November,

900
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:56,000
and they have it in 14 different countries.

901
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:01,000
They said right now they're shooting for 31 games from 21 publishers.

902
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:05,000
They have this Founders Edition that's $130,

903
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:08,000
which includes the Stadia controller.

904
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:12,000
I think one of the Google...

905
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,000
I forget.

906
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
The Chromecast type thing.

907
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:19,000
And then they've also got three months of the Stadia Pro service.

908
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:25,000
And then I think there's also three months of Stadia Pro for a friend as well,

909
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
which is interesting.

910
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
That's a clever idea, John.

911
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:33,000
And then of course some of the games that they are mentioning

912
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,000
were beyond the service.

913
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:37,000
So from Bethesda, for example, they have Doom Eternal,

914
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:41,000
Doom 2016, Rage 2, The Elder Scrolls Online,

915
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
Wolfenstein Youngblood,

916
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
Bungie has Destiny 2,

917
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:48,000
they've got Thumper on there,

918
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
Metro Exodus, Grid,

919
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:53,000
Farming Simulator 19,

920
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:57,000
Square Enix's Final Fantasy XV,

921
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
Tomb Raider Definitive Edition,

922
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,000
Rise of the Tomb Raider,

923
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,000
Shadow of the Tomb Raider,

924
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:04,000
2K's got NBA 2K, Borderlands 3,

925
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
Mortal Kombat 11 is going to be in there,

926
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
lots of Ubisoft games.

927
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:11,000
So it's got a pretty good selection of titles.

928
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:14,000
But it's not Netflix.

929
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,000
It's not Netflix.

930
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
So that Google, that Stadia Pro,

931
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:18,000
so what that is,

932
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:21,000
that allows you to do the 4K streaming at 60 frames per second,

933
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:25,000
and then you also get the surround sound along with that.

934
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:28,000
There's going to be free games with it,

935
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
so I would think like...

936
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
PlayStation Plus is kind of nice.

937
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,000
Yeah, PlayStation Plus or something like that.

938
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
Destiny 2 is confirmed to be one of those.

939
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:38,000
But no, you do not get the whole library for free.

940
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:41,000
There is a mode if you don't want to do 4K streaming,

941
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
you can do 1080p streaming for free.

942
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:46,000
And it's only in stereo as well.

943
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
But apparently, you know,

944
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:52,000
the requirements that you need to actually stream that,

945
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
so it's I think 35 megabits down

946
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
if you want to do the 4K streaming,

947
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:01,000
and then anywhere from I think 10 to get the 720p.

948
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
And then of course, as Bobby's mentioned,

949
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:06,000
and as it's on of all our minds,

950
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:09,000
that's going to eat through your data cap so fast.

951
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:12,000
With the 4K streaming, you can get 60 hours out of it,

952
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
I believe some of the math has been said,

953
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
before you hit one terabyte.

954
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:19,000
Now, you know, this will be a question I think for cable companies to answer as well.

955
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:22,000
I don't want to necessarily like, you know,

956
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:25,000
shoot Google in the foot and say this thing is terrible

957
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:28,000
because, you know, bandwidth caps and so forth.

958
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,000
I see they're trying to get out in front of it.

959
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:33,000
I mean, it is inevitable, bandwidth caps will raise

960
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
because they've risen before.

961
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:38,000
As we rely more and more on the internet and so forth,

962
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:41,000
the market is going to force those bandwidth caps to raise.

963
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,000
It's just a question of when.

964
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
I don't know if it's going to be later this year.

965
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,000
In fact, I highly doubt it.

966
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:48,000
So people are going to have to budget that a little bit

967
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
if they plan to do 4K gaming.

968
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:53,000
But I don't know about you, Loki, I don't have a 4K TV.

969
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:56,000
So if I were to go get a Chromecast and put that and so forth,

970
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
I wouldn't be doing it anyway.

971
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:02,000
But I'm a little more, when it comes to Google Stadia,

972
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
like, I want to like it.

973
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
There's things about it I do like.

974
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
I think the controller is kind of neat.

975
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,000
I like this whole concept.

976
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,000
If you can pick it up everywhere.

977
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:16,000
I just don't like the idea of paying $60 for this game that,

978
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:20,000
that's kind of where I think where a lot of the on-live jokes come from, right?

979
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:23,000
Is that you bought this game full price online

980
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
and you don't really own it

981
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:28,000
because heaven forbid Google Stadia ever go away.

982
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:33,000
And Google has sunsetted many of their products.

983
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:40,000
Pour one out for Google Plus or Google Buzz or Google Wave or, right?

984
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:43,000
So there's, you know, a lot of Google stuff sometimes gets sunsetted.

985
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:47,000
But at the same time, I don't want to like shit on this and say it's terrible.

986
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,000
I don't think it's terrible.

987
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:52,000
I just feel like, oh, I just wish they'd opted for a different,

988
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:55,000
like I wish they would try to strengthen, you know,

989
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
especially now that Microsoft's kind of put out this,

990
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
this ultimate game pass.

991
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:02,000
I'm like, well, here's, here's, here's a perfect comparison.

992
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:06,000
OK, so we're talking Stadia versus Microsoft's offering.

993
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:11,000
So like I have a modern day PC and I'm willing to pay $10 a month.

994
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:15,000
I can either get Stadia Plus and I can stream games to that.

995
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:18,000
But I don't get any sort of game library with that.

996
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:22,000
Or I could pay $10 a month and go the Microsoft Games Pass route.

997
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
And I have a library of hundreds of games

998
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:27,000
that are constantly getting brand new games added in it.

999
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:31,000
Why would I want to pay for $10 a month to do 4K streaming for...

1000
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
I just don't, it doesn't make any sense.

1001
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:40,000
I feel like this, I know it's gonna be a weird thing to say

1002
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
because I know Google feels like they have to be competitive.

1003
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:45,000
I know they feel like they want to get in front, out in front of this

1004
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:46,000
because this is where the industry is going.

1005
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
And I think that is all correct.

1006
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:51,000
I think they are launching this one year too soon.

1007
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:56,000
Because I think if they'd waited to be able to maybe respond a little more

1008
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
to what now Microsoft is doing on this side

1009
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:01,000
and maybe wait to see if some of the 4K streaming

1010
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:04,000
is only going to get bigger and bigger on Netflix and Amazon Prime.

1011
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:07,000
Maybe that's going to start the conversation about bandwidth caps and so forth.

1012
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:10,000
I just kind of feel like this is almost one year too soon.

1013
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:13,000
But to be fair, I'm going to raise the counterpoint

1014
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
a lot of you are probably thinking about right now.

1015
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:19,000
Stadia kind of isn't really launching fully this year anyway.

1016
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
It's only on that Chromecast.

1017
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
It's a very limited thing.

1018
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:27,000
And to be fair, Stadia doesn't require a powerful PC to run.

1019
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
It's just streaming.

1020
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:33,000
Whereas the Microsoft stuff is running on your PC hardware.

1021
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:36,000
But they're also going to have their Microsoft cloud service saying that

1022
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:40,000
I don't know how that's going to play into it once that launches.

1023
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:43,000
But for me, I have what I have.

1024
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:47,000
And so I'm not really interested in Stadia in that sense

1025
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:50,000
because I don't need another system to play Destiny 2 on.

1026
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:55,000
I have Destiny 2 on several systems and I don't play it.

1027
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
Stadia might do really well.

1028
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:00,000
I'm going to be fair because, again, I don't want to shit on what Google's doing

1029
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:04,000
because there are little pieces in here that I really like

1030
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
and I want to see them succeed.

1031
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:10,000
So I hope at least maybe Google's opening to maybe shifting this around a little bit.

1032
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
Maybe if they learn some things from this launch and so forth.

1033
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:17,000
But where I do think Google stands to do very well

1034
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:22,000
is in countries that don't always get supported very well

1035
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:25,000
by Sony, Microsoft, Nintendo,

1036
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:28,000
which I know is ironic because Stadia is only launching in 14 countries.

1037
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:34,000
I know it's also ironic because other countries only have so much limited access to Internet.

1038
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:39,000
But I still think there might be enough places in the world where at least the 1080p streaming,

1039
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:42,000
which, let's be real, for most people is going to be good enough.

1040
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
And some of you are talking about this in chat as well,

1041
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:48,000
is that if you don't have a TV of a certain size, 4K isn't going to do much for you anyway.

1042
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:54,000
So for a lot of people, 1080p is going to be good enough for now.

1043
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:59,000
So there may be a lot of parts of the world where consoles aren't as easy to come by

1044
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:02,000
where maybe Stadia may be a more attractive alternative.

1045
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:07,000
But again, it just depends on, well, if the consoles aren't easy to come by, how's the Internet infrastructure?

1046
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:10,000
It just depends on what country we're talking about.

1047
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:13,000
Anyway, now mistake theory points out.

1048
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
I don't think it's too little too late.

1049
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:20,000
If it works really well and keeps getting games, all four go a next-gen system.

1050
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:23,000
And I was in the Assassin's Creed test and I loved it.

1051
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:28,000
And I will say, a lot of people that were in that test, I don't hear negative things about it.

1052
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:31,000
A lot of people that were in that saying, yeah, it was responsive, it played very well,

1053
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:34,000
it was a very impressive piece of technology.

1054
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
So I think we need to all keep that in mind.

1055
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:41,000
I think one thing Google really needs to do when they come out the gate in 2020

1056
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:49,000
is they need to have not just that free, but they need to sprinkle in a few free games just to get you hooked.

1057
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:55,000
And if I'm not mistaken, didn't Destiny 2, didn't they announce the base Destiny 2 package to be free for everybody anyway?

1058
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:56,000
They did.

1059
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:57,000
Okay.

1060
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:00,000
Destiny 2 in the first year of DLC that was for it.

1061
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
Okay. So there you go.

1062
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:07,000
Why doesn't Stadia just give the Destiny 2 thing for the free level people, that base thing you just mentioned,

1063
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:10,000
for the free level people so that people can get a taste of it, people can sample it.

1064
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
Because maybe it'll win me over.

1065
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:17,000
If I get my hands on it and I play it on my shitty old laptop and it runs really well, I might be like, oh, this is kind of cool.

1066
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
Well, and that's the other thing too.

1067
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:23,000
They showed off some games, I want to say, that may have multiplayer in them.

1068
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:26,000
Do I have to buy two of these controllers to do that?

1069
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:27,000
I mean...

1070
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:32,000
Probably, but you could also probably have one person on controller, one person on keyboard and mouse.

1071
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:35,000
It'll work with other controllers, won't it? Didn't they show the other one on?

1072
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:39,000
It does, but the best controller because it connects directly to the Wi-Fi or something.

1073
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:40,000
Right.

1074
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
Like there's going to be that much latency, I don't know.

1075
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
Alright, whatever.

1076
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
Alright, to be continued.

1077
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:50,000
And then we got to Bethesda, which was wrapping up as our show started tonight.

1078
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:56,000
So if Loki seemed a little distracted, he kind of had one ear on the Bethesda thing while that was going on.

1079
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
Because I don't even know everything they talked about.

1080
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:02,000
They didn't talk about much. In fact, I'm going to just try to see if I can pull up on her.

1081
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
Well, our expectations were kind of low, right?

1082
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
It was very low.

1083
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
No, they weren't going to show any of that.

1084
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:09,000
They said that.

1085
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:13,000
So yeah, basically it was the same type of stuff you would expect that they would show.

1086
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:22,000
So they talked a little bit about Fallout 76 and that there's going to be a brand new set of content coming out for that free.

1087
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
So they have, for example...

1088
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,000
Battle Royale!

1089
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:28,000
Yes, there's this nuclear winter mode called Battle Royale.

1090
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
It's a 52 player Battle Royale game.

1091
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
Didn't they also kind of apologize for Fallout 76?

1092
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:37,000
They did. They did apologize that they'd received lots of critique.

1093
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:46,000
There's a brand new free update called Wastelanders that's going to have human NPC characters as well with full dialogue trees.

1094
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:49,000
A new main quest that's coming out this fall.

1095
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:53,000
And then apparently if you want to try Fallout 76, you can do that.

1096
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:58,000
They have a free week or so that's from the 10th through the 17th or 16th?

1097
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:01,000
Yeah, the 17th. So you can try it out then.

1098
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:07,000
Elder Scrolls Blades is coming to Switch and no one gave a shit.

1099
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:13,000
They have the Elder Scrolls Legends, which is going to be the next expansion for that.

1100
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
It's called Moons of Elsewhere.

1101
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:22,000
They also have Elder Scrolls Online dungeon DLC called Scalebreaker.

1102
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:29,000
They showed off a little bit of Wolfenstein Cyberpilot, which is a VR game coming in July.

1103
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:36,000
A game that I was excited for when they originally were showing this trailer, Commander Keen.

1104
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
That's pretty cool. Commander Keen's back.

1105
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:41,000
It's pretty cool. It's a 2D side scrolling game.

1106
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:48,000
It is unfortunately a mobile title and it looks like it's just...

1107
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:52,000
I'll hope they had it for it just like right down the tube.

1108
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
Choices.

1109
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:58,000
Rage 2 is getting an expansion called Rise of the Ghosts.

1110
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:03,000
They also talked about this new software technology for game streaming called Orion.

1111
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:08,000
That's something that I guess is developing and they're implementing at the engine level

1112
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:12,000
that lets game streams with much lower latency.

1113
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:16,000
It's supposed to help stream games at max settings.

1114
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:19,000
This is something they're looking to implement in things like Starfield.

1115
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:25,000
I think maybe stuff that they're looking to implement with Stadia games and stuff like that.

1116
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,000
Because they do have stuff coming on there.

1117
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:32,000
Deathloop is another game that's coming out by...

1118
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:35,000
I think it's... was it Arcade Lion?

1119
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
What is it?

1120
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:42,000
It looks like an action game but it's a time loop type thing.

1121
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
I'm not really sure what it was based on the trailer.

1122
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:47,000
It just showed two people fighting each other.

1123
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:53,000
And then they had Ghostwire Tokyo which was another game that was teased.

1124
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,000
It looked kind of interesting.

1125
00:56:55,000 --> 00:57:02,000
And then of course they showed off Doom Eternal and it looks amazing.

1126
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
Did they date it?

1127
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:07,000
They did. It was November 22nd I think.

1128
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:08,000
It's in November.

1129
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
Cool.

1130
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:14,000
Yeah, the Doom reboot was so good so I'm happy to hear it.

1131
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:17,000
They also have a multiplayer mode called Battle Mode.

1132
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:18,000
It's two players...

1133
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:19,000
Battle Royale mode?

1134
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:24,000
Two players control a demon versus one player who's Doom guy.

1135
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:27,000
Okay. Oh, interesting.

1136
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:28,000
Yeah, so...

1137
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:31,000
So it's like Pac-Man versus but Doom.

1138
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,000
I kind of like that. That's cool.

1139
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,000
So yeah, neat.

1140
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
But yeah, nothing unexpected really.

1141
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,000
Nothing surprising.

1142
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:40,000
Just kind of standard fare.

1143
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:41,000
Okay.

1144
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:44,000
Well, I think we knew it was going to be more...

1145
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:47,000
And in general, it's a break.

1146
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:51,000
This is the last year of the current gen before we bring on the next gen.

1147
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:58,000
And I imagine things like Starfield, Elder Scrolls VI are almost assuredly the next gen systems at this point.

1148
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:59,000
Oh yeah.

1149
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:00,000
Very interesting to see.

1150
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:04,000
I think next year's E3 is going to be quite a show I bet.

1151
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:10,000
Anyway, usually we do this a little more towards the top of the show but with all the E3 hype tonight,

1152
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
we wanted to get all that news out of the way.

1153
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:15,000
A little bit of a different flow for E3.

1154
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:19,000
Next week's show will be the same thing because this time next week we're only part way through E3.

1155
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:23,000
So still to come, we have the PC Gaming Conference.

1156
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,000
Your favorite is going to be tomorrow.

1157
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,000
Devolver is going on right now.

1158
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:30,000
They're saying it's a Nintendo Direct parody apparently.

1159
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
I can't wait.

1160
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:33,000
Hoot and a holler.

1161
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:36,000
We'll try to get the bullet points on that before the show is out tonight.

1162
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:39,000
But I'm sure you'll watch the whole thing later if it's that funny.

1163
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:42,000
But we also know Nintendo is a huge deal.

1164
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:43,000
People are waiting for that.

1165
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:44,000
That's Tuesday.

1166
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:45,000
Intellivision.

1167
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,000
Amico is apparently showing...

1168
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:51,000
Bobby gave us the tea at the end of his show that they're doing something behind closed doors tomorrow.

1169
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:54,000
We don't know if it's going to be embargoed or not, but we may get some details on that.

1170
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:57,000
Maybe behind closed doors and not get the information out.

1171
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,000
Well, it may be embargoed until a certain date.

1172
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,000
They may not want it all.

1173
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:02,000
They may be showing people.

1174
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
They may be trying to get buyers.

1175
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
You know that from your world that you used to be in.

1176
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:09,000
Maybe they're trying to get the buyers and the shelf space basically.

1177
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:13,000
They want to show people to get the shelf space at Target and things like that.

1178
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,000
And maybe the press to some extent.

1179
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,000
But maybe they don't want their news being lost in E3 weeks.

1180
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:18,000
They might embargo it until later.

1181
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:19,000
Who knows?

1182
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:20,000
We don't know.

1183
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:21,000
We don't know.

1184
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:22,000
We might see everything tomorrow.

1185
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:23,000
We don't know.

1186
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:24,000
Square Enix is going to be tomorrow.

1187
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
And actually, here, I'll plug right now.

1188
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:30,000
Here at Twitch.tv slash VOG Network, you can actually check out.

1189
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:33,000
Bobby Blackwolf and I are bringing a special spinoff show tomorrow.

1190
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:36,000
We're going to live react to the Square Enix conference.

1191
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:40,000
The thing we always said we don't understand why people do these.

1192
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:44,000
We've heard from enough people that have said things akin to,

1193
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:49,000
God, I wish I could have seen Rob when they announced Phantasy Star on Line 2.

1194
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,000
So, all right.

1195
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:54,000
Square Enix, I know, is not maybe the one you want to see us react to.

1196
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:58,000
But the reality is we hold day jobs, the 9 to 5 type of thing.

1197
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:02,000
So, Square Enix is in the right time slot for us to do.

1198
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
So, we'll do a react tomorrow for Square Enix.

1199
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,000
Ubisoft and...

1200
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:07,000
Ubisoft is still coming up.

1201
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,000
And the PC show...

1202
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:10,000
Nintendo.

1203
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:11,000
Nintendo on Tuesday.

1204
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:12,000
Yeah.

1205
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
So, I feel like I'm missing somebody.

1206
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
There's probably more stuff during the week, too.

1207
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:19,000
Like, there's always the Treehouse Live stuff that they always show more things.

1208
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,000
They might give a little bit there, too.

1209
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,000
Is Sony doing any sort of, like, streaming stuff?

1210
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,000
Like, I don't know.

1211
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:28,000
No, we don't think Sony has any type of response.

1212
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
Or they're relying on third parties to carry them through.

1213
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
So, we don't know. We don't know.

1214
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
And Bobby is saying in chat about the Intellivision.

1215
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
It's not embargoed.

1216
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
They just don't have a booth.

1217
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
And they have a meeting room, which is cheaper.

1218
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:44,000
And they're only booking by appointment is basically what it is.

1219
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
So, very cool.

1220
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:47,000
All right.

1221
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,000
Let's get into our gaming weeks.

1222
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,000
So, the types of video games that we have been playing this week.

1223
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,000
Usually, we would have done this earlier in the show.

1224
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,000
But, you know, it's going crazy around here.

1225
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,000
Well, I've got unfortunate news.

1226
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,000
I haven't played anything this week.

1227
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,000
I played a little bit of Pokemon Go.

1228
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,000
So, I was just busy.

1229
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,000
It was a very stressful week.

1230
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,000
Yeah, didn't play anything.

1231
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,000
I played a little bit.

1232
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:12,000
I played, you know, Pokemon Go had Community Day yesterday.

1233
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
And I was really distracted.

1234
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
I wasn't able to play a ton

1235
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,000
because I was out, you know,

1236
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
Pride was going on here locally this weekend.

1237
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
Which, by the way, on a Pride tangent real quick,

1238
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:25,000
happy Pride to everybody that's celebrating.

1239
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:28,000
And also, I should point out a little shout-out

1240
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
because I've already seen this happen in our chat.

1241
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
And I do want to say thank you, thank you.

1242
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:35,000
Twitch is running a cute little Pride promotion right now

1243
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,000
where there are special emotes.

1244
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:40,000
And if you cheer at least 200 biddies with one of those emotes,

1245
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
and it's all there in the biddies thing,

1246
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:46,000
then you actually enable extra emotes for random chatters.

1247
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:49,000
For example, SheHulk10 just did one.

1248
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:50,000
Thank you, thank you.

1249
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:53,000
And I got a little Pride lion out of it in chat.

1250
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:54,000
So, it's kind of cool.

1251
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:57,000
Like, if you do cheers, you're actually giving our chatters

1252
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:58,000
emote icon gifts.

1253
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
So, that's really cool.

1254
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
So, thank you to everybody that's participating in that.

1255
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:05,000
I'll read off the names of the donators a little later on in the show.

1256
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,000
But I do want to say thank you.

1257
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,000
Oh, and what's also very important about that

1258
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,000
is that Twitch is actually making,

1259
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,000
I believe a percentage of that,

1260
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,000
it's a small percentage, but it is a percentage,

1261
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,000
is going to the Trevor Project,

1262
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:20,000
which is a great charity for LGBTQ+.

1263
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
So, great. Fantastic.

1264
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,000
And thank you, Twitch, for supporting that.

1265
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
Anyway, okay, so, sorry.

1266
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:29,000
MikeyMeweek was distracted with Pride, Pokemon Go,

1267
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:33,000
but I did catch four shinies of the pink slakoths.

1268
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,000
And for not really playing, that's pretty good.

1269
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:37,000
So, I'll take it.

1270
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:40,000
And I played a lot of Diablo III.

1271
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:43,000
That's really been my go-to clicky click party game.

1272
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:46,000
I'm up to Paragon 170.

1273
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,000
I've played a lot. I've done a lot of rifts.

1274
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:51,000
I've leveled gems up to 25, gotten the extra abilities.

1275
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,000
So, I'm enjoying that, playing my wizard.

1276
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,000
Also been playing a little bit of Heroes of the Storm,

1277
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:59,000
Final Fantasy XIV, because the expansion is only like three weeks away.

1278
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:02,000
And so, there's a lot of hype, or early access is only like three weeks away.

1279
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
So, there's a lot of hype going into Shadowbringers

1280
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:05,000
in the next expansion of Final Fantasy XIV.

1281
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,000
So, I'm really excited about that.

1282
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,000
And been watching some stuff on Twitch,

1283
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,000
but otherwise, as far as playing other stuff,

1284
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:15,000
I haven't really sat down with any other games in depth this week.

1285
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,000
And stream. I was playing a little more and stream.

1286
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,000
And some of the streamable stuff on there.

1287
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:22,000
But too many games I was sampling the list off.

1288
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:28,000
But they're not going to add any more games to and stream during early access.

1289
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:31,000
They've kind of said, you know, early access is just this list,

1290
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:34,000
and then we are going to add.

1291
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:37,000
They said they're going to add games on a regular basis,

1292
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:40,000
but they don't want to say, we're going to add five games every Thursday.

1293
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
They don't want to beholden themselves to a schedule.

1294
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:45,000
They say, we're going to release games when they're done,

1295
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,000
but there will be a fair amount, basically.

1296
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:49,000
But they did add new challenges.

1297
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,000
So, they added a few more challenges.

1298
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,000
That's kind of nice to see them still doing that.

1299
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,000
So, very, very cool.

1300
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,000
So, yeah.

1301
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,000
That was really it for my gaming week.

1302
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:03,000
So, I think with that, we've got plenty more news to come

1303
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,000
a little later on in the show here.

1304
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,000
So, let's get to the Classic Game of the Week.

1305
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:10,000
Dark Soccer is not here tonight, so you know what that means.

1306
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:11,000
I invited on a guest this week.

1307
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:12,000
So, you ready to get to it?

1308
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:15,000
Yes, let's get to it.

1309
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:18,000
And so, we're going to take a trip down memory lane

1310
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:21,000
to a segment that we call the Classic Game of the Week.

1311
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:24,000
And usually, Dark Soccer or Jamie Summers,

1312
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:27,000
she steps into the gaming vault and finds a game that she thinks,

1313
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:30,000
hey, you guys should be checking out this game this week.

1314
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
But, as I mentioned earlier in the program,

1315
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
Dark Soccer is not going to be able to make the show tonight.

1316
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:37,000
So, as we've been doing lately when Jamie's unavailable,

1317
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:40,000
we've been inviting some special guests on the show to help us fill in.

1318
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
So, helping us fill in on tonight's program,

1319
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:48,000
please welcome back to the show a podcaster and a regular streamer.

1320
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:51,000
Welcome back, Delvin, Video Game Realness.

1321
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:52,000
Hello.

1322
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:53,000
Hello, everybody.

1323
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:54,000
Hi, welcome back.

1324
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:57,000
It's been a few months since we had you here live.

1325
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:58,000
It's been a moment.

1326
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
It's been a hot minute.

1327
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
So, let's get to it.

1328
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,000
I have a lot I want to talk to you about,

1329
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
but specifically, this segment is the Classic Game of the Week.

1330
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
So, let's get into it.

1331
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:09,000
You know the drill.

1332
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:10,000
We're going to pick a game

1333
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
and we're going to spotlight that game this week.

1334
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:15,000
So, I said you can pick pretty much any game you want

1335
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:18,000
except this list of 500 games we've already done.

1336
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:23,000
So, what did you pick for the Classic Game of the Week this week?

1337
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:26,000
Well, I went through the list and I had two options

1338
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:29,000
and I was actually surprised that this one that I chose was not on the list.

1339
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:32,000
It's Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles for the NES.

1340
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
Oh, good pick. Good pick.

1341
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
Tiger Claw is screaming somewhere.

1342
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
He's a big Ninja Turtles fan.

1343
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:39,000
No, this is great.

1344
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:40,000
So, tell us about it.

1345
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:43,000
Well, so I'm a huge Ninja Turtles fan myself.

1346
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:46,000
I was obsessed with Ninja Turtles as a child.

1347
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:51,000
Like, if you could name any type of Ninja Turtles paraphernalia

1348
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,000
that existed back then,

1349
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:58,000
whether it be pencils, the figurines, the blimp,

1350
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:02,000
April O'Neil, the communicators, shoes, binders,

1351
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:05,000
everything Ninja Turtles related, I had it.

1352
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:06,000
So...

1353
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
Binders full of turtles?

1354
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
Yes.

1355
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:14,000
So, there was natural extension that when this game was available,

1356
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
my parents got it for me.

1357
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
Well, actually, technically, no, my parents didn't get it for me.

1358
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:22,000
So, I live in Canada and I have an aunt that lives in the US

1359
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:25,000
and games were significantly cheaper in the US.

1360
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:29,000
So, my aunt had bought, like, eight games for us

1361
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,000
and she sent them to us.

1362
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,000
And so, this was one of the games that she bought for us

1363
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,000
because, of course, she knew that I liked Ninja Turtles.

1364
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:41,000
So, this game was released in 1989

1365
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:48,000
and is a side-scrolling platform game with an overhead overworld.

1366
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
So, you kind of go over in the overworld

1367
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:53,000
and then there's, like, sewers that you go into for each level.

1368
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:56,000
And, of course, it stars the four Ninja Turtles, Leonardo,

1369
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
Raphael, Michelangelo, Donatello,

1370
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:01,000
and they all feature their special weapons

1371
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:04,000
with varying different power and speed.

1372
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:08,000
So, Leonardo is kind of your all-around average guy.

1373
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:11,000
Raphael is quick, but very weak,

1374
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:15,000
but good at eliminating small mobs.

1375
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:18,000
Michelangelo is kind of your, again, all-around,

1376
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:21,000
and Donatello is slow, but his is the most powerful weapon.

1377
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:27,000
So, the storyline of the game is very much what you can expect from a NES game.

1378
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,000
There is very little storyline,

1379
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:34,000
but the storyline follows very much the Ninja Turtles arc

1380
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:38,000
where you're trying to battle Shredder.

1381
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:43,000
He has a weapon that can turn Master Splinter back into a human.

1382
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:44,000
So, they're trying to get that back,

1383
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:48,000
and the game starts out with you having to rescue April O'Neil,

1384
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:51,000
and you go through and rescue April O'Neil,

1385
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:52,000
and then you find out,

1386
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
oh, you have to go do something else,

1387
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
and while you're going to do that,

1388
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
oh, Master Splinter gets kidnapped,

1389
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
and then you have to go save him,

1390
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
and then you go into the beach Shredder.

1391
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:08,000
So, it is an overworld game,

1392
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,000
and you go through different levels,

1393
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:13,000
just traversing, trying to find where the end level is,

1394
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:15,000
because it starts out pretty simple

1395
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:19,000
where there's only certain worlds that you can go into,

1396
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:22,000
but once you start to get into the later parts of the game,

1397
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:25,000
there's a whole bunch of levels that are pretty much optional.

1398
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,000
You don't even have to do them.

1399
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:30,000
So, it's kind of an adventure in that sense

1400
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
where you have to kind of figure out where it is that you need to go,

1401
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:35,000
but there are little things that you can pick up along the way

1402
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:37,000
to make the journey a bit easier for you.

1403
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:44,000
So, they do have special weapons that the Ninja Turtles can get.

1404
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:51,000
As on-use weapons, and they come in the quantity of 20 usually.

1405
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,000
So, they have the Ninja Stars,

1406
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:56,000
they have triple Ninja Stars, Boomerangs,

1407
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
and the almighty Scrolls.

1408
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:01,000
The Scrolls are the best item to get in the game.

1409
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:05,000
It's especially handy for beating bosses.

1410
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:11,000
So, there's some world levels that have those Scrolls,

1411
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:12,000
and generally when you're playing it,

1412
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:15,000
you want to stock up all your Turtles with it

1413
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:20,000
because each of the four can have one of the special weapons.

1414
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
So, you can kind of mix it up,

1415
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:27,000
but the thing is some levels have them predetermined as to where they are,

1416
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,000
and then sometimes you'll go through a level

1417
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:32,000
and then one of these special weapons will just show up,

1418
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:35,000
and if you walk right into the item, you end up losing it.

1419
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,000
So, that was one of the caveats of the game

1420
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:39,000
where you'd stock up on Scrolls

1421
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:42,000
so that you could make the bosses easier when you got to them,

1422
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:45,000
but you had to be very careful as you were going through levels

1423
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:51,000
to make sure not to accidentally pick up basic Boomerangs

1424
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:54,000
because they're not as powerful as the Scrolls.

1425
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:58,000
So, anyway, as you go throughout the game,

1426
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:01,000
this is a very, very hard game,

1427
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:04,000
and I was never able to beat it.

1428
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:08,000
Until back then, what happened was,

1429
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:13,000
so my parents bought me this videotape, VHS tape, that had...

1430
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:14,000
Oh, wow.

1431
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:18,000
Yeah, because Game Facts wasn't a thing.

1432
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,000
There was no internets.

1433
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,000
There was no internet.

1434
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:29,000
And the strategy guides existed,

1435
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:32,000
but it was really only for the really popular games,

1436
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:37,000
so like your Marios, your Zeldas, Ninja Gaiden, those type of games.

1437
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:41,000
The really popular ones were the ones that were getting strategy guides made

1438
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:43,000
in Nintendo Power and stuff like that.

1439
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:46,000
And a strategy guide is not going to get you the timing

1440
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,000
on that infuriating damn stage

1441
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:52,000
where you're trying to disarm the bombs and all that stuff.

1442
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000
The strategy guides aren't going to show you.

1443
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,000
I don't even want to talk about the damn stage, okay?

1444
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,000
No pun intended.

1445
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:01,000
I believe it's showing on the screen right now, but that's all right.

1446
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,000
Yeah, like...

1447
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,000
It's a notorious part of the game.

1448
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:10,000
This level is horrible, because it has seaweed in certain sections,

1449
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:14,000
and the seaweed kind of pulls you in as a current.

1450
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:18,000
So it's hard to swim in certain sections, and there's lightning,

1451
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:21,000
and it's just a very horrible, horrible level.

1452
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:24,000
I still have PTSD over it.

1453
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:29,000
So the tape was a complete playthrough,

1454
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,000
pretty much like what you would see on YouTube now,

1455
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:33,000
but on a VHS tape back then,

1456
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:37,000
and this guy narrated how to get through the game,

1457
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:40,000
what levels you should go into to kind of get the scrolls,

1458
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:43,000
the best ways to beat certain levels,

1459
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,000
because the later on you progress through the game,

1460
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:48,000
once you get into the tectodrome,

1461
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,000
the tectodrome is insane,

1462
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:55,000
and you start to also get limited amounts of pizza,

1463
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:58,000
which is what is used to regenerate your life.

1464
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:02,000
So you start getting less of that as you progress through the game,

1465
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,000
and then even if you want to get some,

1466
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:07,000
you have to kind of go to a far part of the stage

1467
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,000
to even get pizza to rejuvenate it.

1468
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:12,000
So the game just becomes increasingly harder that way,

1469
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:15,000
and then you technically don't have any lives.

1470
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:19,000
Your lives are the Ninja Turtles.

1471
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:22,000
So the Ninja Turtles can die,

1472
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:25,000
and then you can go to a certain level and rescue them,

1473
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:26,000
because they get captured.

1474
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,000
They don't necessarily die,

1475
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:32,000
but if all four of the turtles get captured, that's it.

1476
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,000
You have to basically continue.

1477
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,000
I think you get two continues

1478
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:39,000
before you have to start all over again from the beginning.

1479
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:42,000
So it is a very hard game.

1480
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:50,000
So one of the things I was actually looking up for this game

1481
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,000
to talk about this today

1482
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:55,000
was the regional differences of the game.

1483
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:59,000
So the game was released for the Famicom in Japan

1484
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:01,000
a few months earlier than the American NES version

1485
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:04,000
under the name Geki Kame Ninja Den,

1486
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:08,000
which loosely translates to Legend of the Radical Ninja Turtles.

1487
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:11,000
And this was the first Ninja Turtles product released in the country,

1488
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:16,000
predating the Japanese dub of both the first film and the animated series.

1489
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:19,000
And subsequent Ninja Turtles games released in Japan

1490
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:21,000
kept the franchise original title.

1491
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:24,000
And while graphics and gameplay are virtually identical,

1492
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:28,000
the Japanese localization changed the plot by turning April O'Neil

1493
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:31,000
from an acquaintance of the turtles to Splinter's daughter.

1494
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:36,000
So it's such a random change to make

1495
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:39,000
that they would make April Splinter's daughter,

1496
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:45,000
but especially because the game doesn't really have that much dialogue

1497
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:48,000
that would really be able to convey that.

1498
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,000
So it's interesting that they would have changed the dialogue

1499
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:54,000
to actually convey, oh, this is Splinter's daughter.

1500
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,000
So I just found that was...

1501
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,000
Exploring Splinter turning into a human,

1502
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,000
that was something I don't remember ever being addressed.

1503
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:03,000
I mean, it's been a long time, and I don't follow the series as closely

1504
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:05,000
as some of the rest of you, but I seem to remember

1505
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:08,000
that was kind of an angle unique to the game, right?

1506
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:11,000
Or did they explore that in one of the movies or something?

1507
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:14,000
Yeah, they did in the first or second movie?

1508
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,000
Oh, shit. Shows you how much I remember.

1509
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:17,000
I can't recall.

1510
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:21,000
Yeah, because they go into the history of how Splinter and Shredder

1511
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:25,000
know each other and all that stuff.

1512
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:26,000
I will have to...

1513
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:29,000
The movie I saw more than any of them was the third one

1514
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:31,000
when they went back to feudal Japan and all that stuff.

1515
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:32,000
But anyway, I digress.

1516
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:33,000
Oh, that's the worst movie.

1517
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:35,000
I know, right?

1518
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:37,000
You need to watch the first and the second one.

1519
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:40,000
Those are the ones you definitely have to watch.

1520
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:43,000
And then also, so the game was released

1521
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:47,000
as Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles in all the European territories.

1522
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:51,000
So that's another little side tidbit there.

1523
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:56,000
But yeah, this game, it does not like all the other Ninja Turtle games

1524
01:14:56,000 --> 01:15:00,000
that we've come to know for Ninja Turtles games

1525
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,000
as the side-scroll and beat-em-up games

1526
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,000
where you can play up to four players.

1527
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:08,000
The one that came after this was Ninja Turtles the arcade game

1528
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,000
and was completely different from this.

1529
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,000
It wasn't any of the overworld stuff.

1530
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:16,000
It was just your straightforward side-scrolling adventure.

1531
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:19,000
None of this driving in a turtle van all over the city

1532
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:22,000
to find where Master Splinter is in all these different levels.

1533
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,000
It was just straightforward.

1534
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,000
You went from point A to point B,

1535
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,000
but this one was a little bit different.

1536
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:33,000
Kind of almost, I want to say, open world, but not.

1537
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:35,000
For NES.

1538
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:39,000
Right, for NES, it was what you could probably consider open world

1539
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:42,000
and also one of the other things that it had was

1540
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:45,000
randomly generated levels.

1541
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:48,000
Well, not levels, but I would say the enemies that would show up

1542
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:52,000
whenever you entered the level were not always exact.

1543
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:57,000
So if you left a stage and re-entered, the enemies could change.

1544
01:15:57,000 --> 01:16:01,000
And sometimes the type of enemies that you got would change mid-level.

1545
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:06,000
So there's generally a grouping of enemies that would be paired together

1546
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,000
and sometimes they would just randomly change.

1547
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:12,000
Mid-level, and it would never be consistent.

1548
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:19,000
You know what game I'm kind of reminded of with the Konami and Ultra sort of games

1549
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:23,000
where you have the overworld but then you go into these side stages and so forth?

1550
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:25,000
Metal Gear was kind of like that, in a way.

1551
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:28,000
Absolutely, I was actually going to bring that up.

1552
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:32,000
So this game, yes, was developed by Konami and then, of course,

1553
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:36,000
published under the name Ultra Games

1554
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:41,000
because Nintendo had a whole rule back then where publishers were limited

1555
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:47,000
to how many games they could publish under their brand per year.

1556
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:51,000
So Konami jumped that or beat that by having all these different companies,

1557
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:53,000
Ultra Games being one of them.

1558
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:58,000
And so Metal Gear was also in this type of similar style with the overworld

1559
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,000
and then you going into certain levels.

1560
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:03,000
So probably was developed by the same team.

1561
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:08,000
I didn't look that up before doing this,

1562
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:14,000
but it's a good chance that it was developed by a similar team that did this game.

1563
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:19,000
So yeah, Ninja Turtles for the Nintendo Entertainment System.

1564
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:22,000
And what a catchy soundtrack the game had too, for sure.

1565
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:26,000
Oh yeah, I absolutely love the soundtrack in this game.

1566
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:31,000
Even though it's NES and you don't expect amazing soundtracks,

1567
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:36,000
but it was very, very catchy, the music that they did have in the game.

1568
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:40,000
Yeah, despite the fact that the game is notoriously difficult,

1569
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:43,000
I think elements like that, the fact that it was a mixture

1570
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:46,000
of these different genres all at once, a little bit,

1571
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,000
and then the great music and all that stuff.

1572
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:53,000
I know that's why I remember the game as opposed to the arcade game,

1573
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:56,000
which is this whole other thing.

1574
01:17:56,000 --> 01:18:03,000
Yeah, there's actually also a Ninja Turtles game,

1575
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:05,000
Fall of the Foot Clan for Game Boy,

1576
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:10,000
that is kind of similar in this style of level,

1577
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,000
but didn't have an overworld.

1578
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:16,000
So the levels were kind of similar to how it is in this Ninja Turtles

1579
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:20,000
versus the arcade games, but again, there was no overworld.

1580
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:23,000
So it was just straightforward going through different levels.

1581
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:27,000
And in doing research to try to grab footage for the classic games,

1582
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:29,000
and I never realized this before,

1583
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:33,000
but they had ported this NES game to Commodore 64,

1584
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:37,000
the ZX Spectrum, and there was a DOS version as well

1585
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:39,000
that apparently had a game-breaking bug in it.

1586
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:41,000
It was kind of crazy.

1587
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:44,000
Yeah, I was even unaware of that myself.

1588
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:48,000
But yeah, this game has been around for a while.

1589
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:53,000
It made its hops around the early generation of consoles

1590
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:55,000
that were around back then,

1591
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:58,000
but of course, most people remember it being on the NES.

1592
01:18:58,000 --> 01:18:59,000
Yeah.

1593
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:01,000
Okay, so we're going to head back to the studio live

1594
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:03,000
because we have a lot of E3 ground to cover still tonight.

1595
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:05,000
But before we do that,

1596
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:09,000
I want to quickly allow you a chance to plug your streaming on Twitch

1597
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:11,000
if people are not already following.

1598
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:12,000
Absolutely.

1599
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:16,000
You can catch me at twitch.tv slash vgrealness

1600
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:20,000
where I occasionally stream whatever games I'm currently playing at the time,

1601
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:25,000
and right now I'm currently replaying Final Fantasy X on the Switch.

1602
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:27,000
And I have to ask you about this before we get back

1603
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:31,000
because something that you and I were co-streaming a little bit.

1604
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:33,000
I know you took a little break from streaming for a couple months,

1605
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:36,000
and honestly, I've been really bad about it too on my personal channel.

1606
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,000
But you and I were doing a few streams

1607
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:41,000
where we were playing through Phantasy Star Online

1608
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:43,000
on a private server together.

1609
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:44,000
Correct.

1610
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:47,000
And I have to ask, I'm sure we've talked about this in the studio by now,

1611
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:52,000
but Delvin, Phantasy Star Online 2 for the Xbox,

1612
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:56,000
it's happening in the States and Canada, of course,

1613
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,000
and North American regions.

1614
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,000
What was your reaction?

1615
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:03,000
I'm not going to lie, I cried.

1616
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:07,000
So when the trailer came on,

1617
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:11,000
I immediately, because Phantasy Star Online

1618
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:14,000
is one of those games where the soundtrack

1619
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:19,000
is so memorable, so identifiable,

1620
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:23,000
I knew exactly what it was before they even finished.

1621
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:25,000
I knew it was Phantasy Star and I was like,

1622
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:27,000
oh my God, is it actually happening?

1623
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:30,000
I was like having a moment and like breaking down,

1624
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,000
but I was so happy.

1625
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,000
There was definitely a part of me that like,

1626
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:35,000
I think my overwhelming,

1627
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:37,000
and I probably already talked about this in the show,

1628
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:38,000
so I don't want to repeat myself too much,

1629
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,000
but I think my overwhelming reaction was fucking finally.

1630
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,000
But kind of like with that, there's also that part of me,

1631
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:44,000
it's like, no, I still don't believe it.

1632
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:46,000
I still don't believe that they're doing this.

1633
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:47,000
I know, right?

1634
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:49,000
There's still a little bit of me that it's like,

1635
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:50,000
is this actually happening?

1636
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,000
Like, is this a joke?

1637
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:53,000
Yeah, for sure, for sure.

1638
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:55,000
All right, I had to get your opinion on that.

1639
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:58,000
But thank you so much, Delvin, for joining us tonight

1640
01:20:58,000 --> 01:20:59,000
for the classic game of the week.

1641
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:02,000
Have a fantastic week and we'll catch you

1642
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,000
on your Twitch channel soon, okay?

1643
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,000
Thank you so much and thanks for having me.

1644
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:07,000
You are welcome.

1645
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:09,000
Now let's go back to the studio.

1646
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:11,000
All right, thanks so much to Delvin for joining us

1647
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:13,000
for the classic game of the week.

1648
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:14,000
I appreciate you having him on.

1649
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,000
And if you aren't already following VGRealness

1650
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,000
here on Twitter, you should do that.

1651
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:21,000
We're back here with episode number 779,

1652
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:22,000
already in progress for tonight.

1653
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:23,000
I don't think I ever said the episode number

1654
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:24,000
at the top of the show.

1655
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:25,000
I was too busy crying.

1656
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:27,000
Or as you start online, too.

1657
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:29,000
So welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio,

1658
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:34,000
episode number 779 for this June the 9th,

1659
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:40,000
or 6-9, nice, of 2019.

1660
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,000
And, of course, E3 week already underway.

1661
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,000
If you're just joining us, you unfortunately missed

1662
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:47,000
us already recapping the Microsoft event

1663
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:50,000
and the EA Play and Google Stadia,

1664
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,000
kind of all the stuff that we've addressed so far.

1665
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,000
And, of course, in seven days next Sunday

1666
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,000
we'll be back here live to talk about Nintendo

1667
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:59,000
and Square Enix and television and whatever else

1668
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:02,000
shows up on the floor at E3.

1669
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,000
Sadly, not attending the show in person this year.

1670
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,000
It's been a little while since we've been able

1671
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:07,000
to attend the show in person.

1672
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:09,000
But, I mean, now the way it is,

1673
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:10,000
I feel like you just kind of get everything

1674
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:13,000
on YouTube anyway, and then Twitch and all that stuff.

1675
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:18,000
So I really feel like we're best kept to having

1676
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,000
a forum to talk about those types of things

1677
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:23,000
and discuss the things that are getting us excited.

1678
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:25,000
Because, you know, for, again, what is a year

1679
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:27,000
that's kind of supposed to be all that lull

1680
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:29,000
before the next generation of games,

1681
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:31,000
there's still a lot of stuff to get excited about,

1682
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:34,000
even on Sony's end, you know, for not having gone

1683
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:35,000
to E3 this year.

1684
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:38,000
You know, we did talk about, well, if they showed up

1685
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:40,000
at E3, they'd probably be talking about a lot

1686
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:41,000
of the same stuff they have been.

1687
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:44,000
But that doesn't make The Last of Us 2

1688
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,000
or Death Stranding or any of the stuff they have

1689
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:47,000
in the pipeline any less exciting.

1690
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:48,000
Dreams.

1691
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:49,000
I'm still psyched about that game.

1692
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:50,000
Yeah, it should be really good.

1693
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:51,000
Yeah, it should be really good.

1694
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:53,000
Anyway, we're going to pick up and do some more

1695
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:54,000
rapid-fire news.

1696
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,000
And, of course, later on in the show we'll be taking

1697
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:59,000
your phone calls at our Discord.

1698
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:01,000
If you are not already on our Discord,

1699
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:03,000
you should get there over at vognetwork.com.

1700
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:07,000
That's vognetwork.com slash Discord.

1701
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:08,000
Let's get into some rapid-fire news.

1702
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:11,000
Well, if you're hoping to play Shenmue 3 this year,

1703
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:13,000
you'll still get a chance to do that.

1704
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:14,000
It'll still be later on in the year.

1705
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:17,000
So originally it was supposed to be slated for August 2019.

1706
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:19,000
It's now coming out in November.

1707
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:21,000
November 19th is the new date for it.

1708
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:25,000
And on their Kickstarter page,

1709
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:27,000
Yu Suzuki said,

1710
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:44,000
I'm fine with them taking more time on it.

1711
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:45,000
Take the time to get it right, right?

1712
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:46,000
Exactly.

1713
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,000
Now, this is kind of interesting.

1714
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,000
I'm unaware of this type of party game coming out,

1715
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:54,000
but apparently they're making a game called Burger Time Party.

1716
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:55,000
That's right.

1717
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:59,000
They're taking the classic Data East arcade classic game

1718
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:02,000
and turning it into a party game.

1719
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:05,000
So apparently you have to build, of course,

1720
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:07,000
the hamburgers much like the original game,

1721
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:10,000
but now it's a little bit more competitive.

1722
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:11,000
Oh, like Mario Party?

1723
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:14,000
Like can you steal the lettuce from other players?

1724
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:15,000
I don't know.

1725
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:16,000
I'm looking at this.

1726
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:17,000
Is it going to be that crazy like Mario Party?

1727
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:18,000
Screenshots.

1728
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:21,000
I mean, it just looks like Burger Time.

1729
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:23,000
It honestly does.

1730
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:24,000
We'll only need to see it in motion.

1731
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,000
Maybe we'll get some more information later on.

1732
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:27,000
Yeah.

1733
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:29,000
Are they going to have Impossible Burgers in there as well?

1734
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:30,000
Or like, you know, the...

1735
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:31,000
Perhaps.

1736
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:32,000
Perhaps it very well might be.

1737
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,000
Because, you know, we've got to be current and everything.

1738
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:35,000
Yeah.

1739
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:36,000
All right.

1740
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:39,000
Well, let's move on and talk about a game that

1741
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:41,000
I think a lot of you have played at this point,

1742
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:42,000
but it's one of those games where it's like,

1743
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,000
hey, it's finally getting a Switch port,

1744
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:47,000
and that game is Dream Daddy.

1745
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:48,000
Loki, I know you're a big fan.

1746
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:49,000
No, I'm just kidding.

1747
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:50,000
I don't think he's ever played it.

1748
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:51,000
I have not played this game.

1749
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:53,000
I actually haven't played it either,

1750
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:56,000
even though I dressed up as one of the characters.

1751
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:58,000
I did Brian, the one that has a little corgi,

1752
01:24:58,000 --> 01:24:59,000
because he also has like a beard thing.

1753
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:02,000
I dressed up at Dragon Con as him once,

1754
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:04,000
and like maybe three people.

1755
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:05,000
Three people.

1756
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:06,000
Thousands of people go to Dragon Con.

1757
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,000
Three people knew what the hell I was doing.

1758
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:09,000
But you know what?

1759
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:10,000
For those three people, shout out.

1760
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:13,000
Anyway, Dream Daddy is coming out for the Nintendo Switch.

1761
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:15,000
It's also coming out for iOS and Android.

1762
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:18,000
So Dream Daddy, all the things.

1763
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:20,000
No official release date yet,

1764
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,000
but just confirmation that it's coming.

1765
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,000
Happy Pride, I suppose.

1766
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:27,000
And also, not soon, but now,

1767
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:30,000
pretty cool news for Final Fantasy fans.

1768
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,000
All the Final Fantasy soundtracks.

1769
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,000
Well, I have heard a few are missing,

1770
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:35,000
but for the most part,

1771
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:38,000
a big chunk of those Final Fantasy soundtracks,

1772
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:40,000
I know like all the ones for XIV

1773
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:42,000
and like the Final Fantasy XIV music is great.

1774
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:45,000
Anyway, all those soundtracks on Spotify and Apple Music now.

1775
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:48,000
So if you are, you know, paying for those music services,

1776
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:51,000
you should think about getting on there and stream the music.

1777
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:52,000
Good times.

1778
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:54,000
Alright.

1779
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,000
That's it for rapid fire news.

1780
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:57,000
Let's travel around the world

1781
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:59,000
and check out what is coming out in stores this week.

1782
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:01,000
Not a whole lot of stuff coming out over here,

1783
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:05,000
but we've got Battle Worlds Kronos on Nintendo Switch.

1784
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:09,000
We have The House in Fata Morgana,

1785
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:12,000
Dream of the Revalence Edition,

1786
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,000
and that's on PlayStation 4.

1787
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:18,000
Doraemon, Nubita's Story of Seasons,

1788
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,000
that's on Nintendo Switch.

1789
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,000
And last but not least,

1790
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:25,000
Blaster Master Zero on PC.

1791
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:27,000
Oh, that's cool that that's coming to PC.

1792
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:29,000
I remember hearing that that is happening.

1793
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:31,000
So, of course, that was the Switch game.

1794
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:34,000
That's a really cool little, I guess, reinterpretation.

1795
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:36,000
I don't even know if you'd call it like a remaster

1796
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:37,000
because it's like different,

1797
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:39,000
but like a reinterpretation of the original Blaster Master game.

1798
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:40,000
Yeah.

1799
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:42,000
A little on the easy side compared to the original,

1800
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:45,000
but as I get older and worse at video games, that's okay.

1801
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:48,000
So, I'm there for it.

1802
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,000
Let's travel to Japan.

1803
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:52,000
Coming out in Japan this week,

1804
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:55,000
let's see, I think the release day over there is,

1805
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:57,000
I don't know if we actually have a lot.

1806
01:26:57,000 --> 01:27:00,000
I want to see one game on June 13th for the PlayStation 4.

1807
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:04,000
Yumi Utsutsu Remaster coming out in Japan this week

1808
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:06,000
on the PlayStation 4,

1809
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:09,000
and checking the Nintendo Switch to see if there's anything there.

1810
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:11,000
Doraemon, Story of Seasons,

1811
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:13,000
that seems to be the big release from Bandai Namco this week,

1812
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:16,000
a new Doraemon game on the Nintendo Switch over in Japan.

1813
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,000
Dark Sakura has the night off if you're just joining us.

1814
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:22,000
She had a conflict with the Pride events and some other stuff,

1815
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,000
some other personal obligations she had.

1816
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:26,000
So, Loki, do we have the UK dates available?

1817
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:28,000
Yeah, not a whole lot coming out there as well.

1818
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:31,000
We have Kingdom Come Deliverance Royal Edition.

1819
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:34,000
That's on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

1820
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:38,000
We have Leisure Suit Larry, Wet Dreams Don't Dry

1821
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,000
on PlayStation 4 and the Switch.

1822
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:45,000
Warhammer Vermitide 2 Deluxe Edition on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

1823
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:49,000
World End Syndrome on PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch.

1824
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:50,000
And that's it.

1825
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:52,000
All right.

1826
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:54,000
So, for our next segment, we're going to get into your emails.

1827
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:56,000
Every week we invite you to send us emails.

1828
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:58,000
Participate at orangelandtrader.com.

1829
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,000
It's the place where you can send us an email,

1830
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,000
and we read our favorite emails here on the show.

1831
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:05,000
We usually read them all unless it's like spam

1832
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:07,000
or something, I don't know, totally weird,

1833
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:08,000
or really long.

1834
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:10,000
We might have to abbreviate them a little bit

1835
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:12,000
if they're really long.

1836
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:14,000
But we are going to get to the mailbag this week.

1837
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:16,000
We got one email, so I'll read it,

1838
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:18,000
and I think this actually was meant for last week,

1839
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,000
but it got in after the cutoff,

1840
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,000
because, you know, we actually opened the mailbag

1841
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:24,000
a little bit before showtime.

1842
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:25,000
So, I think this got in a little late,

1843
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:26,000
but I'll read it now.

1844
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:29,000
It's a short one, the email this week from Elliot,

1845
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:31,000
one of our pals who's sent us emails before

1846
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:34,000
and used to do some stuff at vognetwork.com.

1847
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:36,000
And he has moved on to much bigger and better things.

1848
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:38,000
I'm very happy for him, congratulations.

1849
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:41,000
Not to shade ourselves, which I think I just did,

1850
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:43,000
but no, if I told you what he did now,

1851
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:45,000
you'd be like, oh, that was bigger and better things.

1852
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:48,000
Anyway, Elliot writes, hey, OLR, writing this fast

1853
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:51,000
so I make it in for the June 2nd show.

1854
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:54,000
After years of flirting with game dev,

1855
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:57,000
I'm finally getting into it, but it's bloody hard.

1856
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:59,000
I'm a web developer in my day job,

1857
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:01,000
and this is 10 times harder.

1858
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:04,000
Just makes you appreciate the technical wizardry

1859
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:07,000
of professionally released games even more.

1860
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:08,000
And that's from Elliot.

1861
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:10,000
You know, kind of also a good reminder tonight.

1862
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:13,000
Well, first off, Loki ought to know how hard it is

1863
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:15,000
to make a game, because he's never finished one.

1864
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:17,000
Yes, that's true.

1865
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:20,000
But, I mean, it also kind of goes to show,

1866
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:22,000
if somebody's like thinking about making a game,

1867
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:24,000
what are some good resources for them to start?

1868
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:26,000
Like, there's a lot of good YouTube tutorials out there.

1869
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:27,000
The internet.

1870
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:29,000
The internet, yeah, it's a wide, wonderful internet.

1871
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:32,000
A lot of these modern development platforms

1872
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:34,000
really good, have a lot of tutorials.

1873
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:35,000
Yeah, I mean, any of them.

1874
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:37,000
Like, if you pick Unity or Unreal,

1875
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:39,000
they've got a lot of different tutorials out there

1876
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:40,000
on how to do stuff.

1877
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:41,000
Yeah.

1878
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:43,000
I know Unity has a ton of stuff.

1879
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:45,000
I've gone through a little bit of the Unreal stuff.

1880
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:48,000
The Unreal tutorials, like the official ones that they have,

1881
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:50,000
not all that helpful.

1882
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:53,000
They're kind of, it's weird how they have them set up,

1883
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:55,000
but there's a lot of like independent stuff out there

1884
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:56,000
that you can find.

1885
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:58,000
There's tutorials and everything out there,

1886
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:01,000
so you just pick your subject and you can find something.

1887
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:04,000
Bobby Blackwolf in our chat at twitch.tv slash vog network says,

1888
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:07,000
what resources should they go to so they can finish a game?

1889
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:10,000
There's a lot about starting, but not about finishing.

1890
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:11,000
That is a problem.

1891
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:14,000
If Loki knew, maybe we wouldn't make fun of him so much.

1892
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:17,000
But, no, that's true.

1893
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:18,000
Finishing is a...

1894
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:19,000
Well, finishing a game,

1895
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:22,000
first thing that you want to do is make sure you don't have a family,

1896
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:24,000
and you're not going to have a family.

1897
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:26,000
What you want to do is make sure you don't have a family,

1898
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:29,000
and that you're not working a full-time job.

1899
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:30,000
Stop.

1900
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:31,000
No, I honestly...

1901
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:33,000
Well, here's the piece of advice I've always heard

1902
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:35,000
that you have flat-out rejected,

1903
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:38,000
and that is to start with a game that you already know.

1904
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:41,000
Make Pong, and then put your spin on it.

1905
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:43,000
Make, I don't know, make...

1906
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:44,000
What are other like...

1907
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:46,000
Breakout, make Breakout, put your spin on it.

1908
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:47,000
Make Kaboom.

1909
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:50,000
Pick an Atari 2600 game, remake it, put your spin on it.

1910
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:51,000
Type it in.

1911
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:53,000
You don't even have to necessarily do that,

1912
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:58,000
but it's like even just following along with some of these tutorials and stuff,

1913
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:01,000
it'll help you with coding,

1914
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:04,000
because a lot of them, especially some of the ones I do,

1915
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:05,000
they kind of give you like,

1916
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:07,000
okay, here, we're doing a bunch of stuff.

1917
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:09,000
Okay, now we're going to have you pause the video,

1918
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:12,000
and you figure out how to do this.

1919
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:14,000
And then when you're done, unpause it,

1920
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:16,000
and then if you can't figure it out, you just watch it,

1921
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:19,000
and it'll kind of help you try to figure out what to do

1922
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:20,000
based on what you've learned already.

1923
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:23,000
And doing some of those will help you kind of get back into the swing of things.

1924
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:26,000
Like, I hadn't been coding in Unity for a long time,

1925
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:29,000
so I went through one of those tutorials just to build a game.

1926
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:33,000
Yes, there is a finished game I have.

1927
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:36,000
No, it's not mine, because it's a Unity tutorial, so that doesn't count.

1928
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:41,000
But it got me back into kind of like,

1929
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:44,000
oh, okay, here's how all the syntax works again,

1930
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:46,000
and I kind of forgot how this was,

1931
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:48,000
and here's how I do these things.

1932
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:50,000
And then, of course, as you're going along,

1933
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:52,000
especially when you're starting out,

1934
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:54,000
you're just going to not know how to do something,

1935
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:55,000
or can't figure something out.

1936
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:58,000
You just search it, Google, stack social.

1937
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:01,000
And if you even want to take it a little bit easier

1938
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:05,000
to just be able to create something, to kind of have an outlet,

1939
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:08,000
like, you know, your oldest kid, eight years old, right,

1940
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:10,000
is doing coding or learning how to do games.

1941
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:12,000
Scratch, yeah. You can do Scratch. That's free.

1942
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:15,000
So there's also very elementary platforms.

1943
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:18,000
Or ZZT, my always favorite.

1944
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:22,000
But no, seriously, making a little big planet level

1945
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:26,000
and making a good one will be a lot about how to make a game.

1946
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:28,000
It's not everything, but it's a lot of, you know,

1947
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:31,000
if you have the patience to finish a really good little big planet level,

1948
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:33,000
it's a start.

1949
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:35,000
And there's a lot of stuff out there that is free.

1950
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:38,000
Unity is free. Unreal Engine is free.

1951
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:42,000
I'm not sure, but I think that there's even a

1952
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:45,000
game maker version that's free.

1953
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:47,000
There's a lot of free versions of things out there.

1954
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:50,000
You can try it out and see if that's going to be a good fit for you.

1955
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:53,000
And if that engine doesn't work for you, then try something else.

1956
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:58,000
Yeah, and some of those, like, Steam, you know, sold game creation platforms,

1957
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:01,000
like, there are really games that have been made on those, right?

1958
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:02,000
Like Five Nights at Freddy's was what?

1959
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:04,000
Click Studio? Was that a...

1960
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:05,000
I don't know.

1961
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:07,000
Sorry, guys, I don't remember which did which.

1962
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:10,000
But I know, like, Five Nights at Freddy's was made for one of those type of engines.

1963
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:13,000
So, and obviously that game has done very well for itself.

1964
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:15,000
Yeah, I mean, there's lots of things out there.

1965
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:18,000
Click Team Fusion. I knew Bobby would correct me.

1966
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:20,000
Love having a live chat.

1967
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:23,000
But yeah, I mean, and a lot of times, like, Humble Bundle will do, like,

1968
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:26,000
a thing of, you know, game maker packs and stuff like that,

1969
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:28,000
where you can get Game Maker Studio for, like, dirt cheap.

1970
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:30,000
Which Bobby points out Undertale was a game maker game.

1971
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:31,000
Yeah.

1972
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:35,000
And then AkumaJP, also giving advice.

1973
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:38,000
I know he's had his fair share of how to make games.

1974
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:41,000
AkumaJP says, just get a free project and play with it.

1975
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:42,000
That's the fastest.

1976
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:45,000
Yes, they always come with a free project.

1977
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:47,000
Just play with that. You'll learn a lot in no time.

1978
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:49,000
So that's a good suggestion as well.

1979
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:51,000
So lots of great suggestions about how to do it.

1980
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:54,000
Which I know is, like, totally not what Elliot was, like, really asking.

1981
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:57,000
But I think also just kind of encouraging people to see what kind of goes into it.

1982
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:59,000
I think it also...

1983
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:01,000
I always...

1984
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:04,000
You know, when people are super critical about games, right?

1985
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:06,000
Like, this game looks like garbage.

1986
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:13,000
Which is so easy to say in a tweet or on a forum post or in the comments section of YouTube.

1987
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:16,000
Being able to say a game is garbage is so easy to do.

1988
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:21,000
But, like, if you really know, like, what goes into making a game,

1989
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:25,000
I think you start to go away from that perspective of garbage game

1990
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:29,000
and more the perspective of, hmm, doesn't look like my cup of tea,

1991
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:31,000
but it's neat that they did this.

1992
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:33,000
Or at least, oh, somebody put together this game, looks cool.

1993
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:37,000
You know, maybe this is some constructive feedback I have on how to make it better.

1994
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:39,000
I think it really does kind of change your perspective a little bit.

1995
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:43,000
Because unfortunately, if you grew up watching, you know, G4TV or TechTV,

1996
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:45,000
you probably remember that commercial about,

1997
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:48,000
here, you should go to school and learn how to make games.

1998
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:51,000
And that dude's sitting there going, let's turn up the graphics on level three.

1999
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:55,000
He turns up and he's like, that is not fucking real at all.

2000
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:57,000
You all know that. Just to make sure you all know that.

2001
01:34:57,000 --> 01:34:59,000
That's not fucking real.

2002
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:00,000
The commercial's not fucking real.

2003
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:03,000
But they have a lot of, like, even community colleges and stuff.

2004
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:06,000
A lot of them have game-making tracks and stuff like that that you can do.

2005
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:10,000
Don't do any of the online colleges, or not the online colleges,

2006
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:14,000
but the game institute I wouldn't necessarily recommend.

2007
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:17,000
I've actually done that before just to see what that was like.

2008
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:20,000
And no, their stuff's pretty dated.

2009
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:22,000
Plus, you can find a lot of it separately.

2010
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:25,000
Udemy has a lot of decent ones you can find,

2011
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:28,000
especially when they go dirt cheap and everything.

2012
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:31,000
But a lot of that stuff's even on YouTube.

2013
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:33,000
YouTube has tons of tutorials out there.

2014
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:37,000
Unity, Unreal, they all do official tutorials for their stuff.

2015
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:39,000
Unity's pretty good about doing that,

2016
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:44,000
and they do them every year during their conferences that they do.

2017
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:47,000
And they always go over the new features that they have,

2018
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:49,000
so that's always good to stay on top of all that stuff.

2019
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:50,000
Because sometimes it's hard to figure out,

2020
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:52,000
especially when you haven't worked in it in a while,

2021
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:55,000
they've changed so much that how you used to do something

2022
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:57,000
isn't the way you do it anymore.

2023
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:00,000
Just a lot of different...

2024
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:01,000
You may want to learn,

2025
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:05,000
how do I make this type of thing happen?

2026
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:07,000
Like a driving game or something like that.

2027
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:09,000
It can get kind of complicated if you want to mimic

2028
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:11,000
some of the things that are out there.

2029
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:14,000
But yeah, just experiment.

2030
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:17,000
Don't try to overscope.

2031
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:20,000
It's hard to say not to do that, but you know.

2032
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:22,000
Take your own advice. I'm just kidding.

2033
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:23,000
I try.

2034
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:25,000
Props to those that are trying to get into it.

2035
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:26,000
So thank you so much for the email.

2036
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:28,000
Please send us more emails.

2037
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:30,000
Participate at orangelauntradio.com.

2038
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:33,000
Before we get to our next story, we have breaking news.

2039
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:35,000
And this is where I need a button for the breaking news,

2040
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:37,000
like the graphic.

2041
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:39,000
So that's something for me to work on during E3.

2042
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:40,000
Breaking news.

2043
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:41,000
Apparently there has been a leak.

2044
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:43,000
This one's pretty major.

2045
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:46,000
GameSpot accidentally posted an article early.

2046
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:48,000
Must have dated the day wrong.

2047
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:50,000
You know, one of those automated pusher things.

2048
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:52,000
Whoopsie doopsie.

2049
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:54,000
Apparently the article says,

2050
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:57,000
Final Fantasy VII Remake releasing this winter.

2051
01:36:57,000 --> 01:37:02,000
So it is a Quarter 4 2019 or Quarter 1 2020.

2052
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:05,000
Remember, winter doesn't necessarily mean before Christmas.

2053
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:07,000
It just means it could be a January, February game.

2054
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:09,000
Final Fantasy VII Remake releasing this winter.

2055
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:13,000
Apparently the little headline on the article said,

2056
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:15,000
Winter is coming.

2057
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:17,000
So you know what that means, right?

2058
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:19,000
And apparently the article also confirmed

2059
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:22,000
it is a PlayStation 4 exclusive.

2060
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:24,000
And apparently there is a release date reveal

2061
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:26,000
to happen at the concert.

2062
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:28,000
I guess this concert that they were doing,

2063
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:31,000
it was supposed to be the time of the big reveal for that.

2064
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:32,000
So there it is.

2065
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:34,000
That is just breaking.

2066
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:37,000
Apparently an article went up and then it was pulled.

2067
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:39,000
But of course once on the internet,

2068
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:41,000
somebody copy pasted it and put it on a reset era

2069
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:43,000
and then it's all over Twitter at this point.

2070
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:45,000
So there you go.

2071
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:46,000
There it is.

2072
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:47,000
Winter is spoiled.

2073
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:48,000
Bobby Blackwell says,

2074
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:50,000
So I guess our co-stream is canceled, Rob.

2075
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:52,000
No, because they're still going to show off footage and so forth.

2076
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:54,000
And we can act surprised at the news.

2077
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:56,000
We can go, what?

2078
01:37:56,000 --> 01:38:00,000
I mean, is it surprising that Final Fantasy VII Remake is this winter?

2079
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:02,000
No.

2080
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:04,000
I don't think so either.

2081
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:08,000
It's dangerous if they don't, if they go out much further

2082
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:12,000
because hello, next year's conversation is going to be about PlayStation 5

2083
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:14,000
and the next Xbox.

2084
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:17,000
So I think the longer they wait to do it,

2085
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:19,000
they're going to be in a little more danger.

2086
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:21,000
Take the time to get it right.

2087
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:23,000
I mean, don't get me wrong,

2088
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:28,000
but the unfortunate part of that is if they wait too long,

2089
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:30,000
then they're going to push it back to the next console,

2090
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:33,000
which I think will be a whole other thing going on there.

2091
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:34,000
So anyway.

2092
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:37,000
From what I hear, though, the concert sucked.

2093
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:39,000
Oh, that's too bad.

2094
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:41,000
You know what, though?

2095
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:45,000
I went to, so Jason and I, Jason, our voiceover guy,

2096
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:48,000
and I went to Dear Friends, the first E3 I ever went to.

2097
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:51,000
And it was like the first Final Fantasy concert in the States.

2098
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:54,000
That was, what, 2004, I think it was, in L.A., was the first E3.

2099
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:56,000
That concert was great.

2100
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:59,000
The next year, we went to More Friends,

2101
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:02,000
which was at a different venue, which, to put it in perspective,

2102
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:06,000
that venue has since been bulldozed and turned into Harry Potter World.

2103
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:09,000
Fact, that is true statement.

2104
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:11,000
Gibson, Gibson, whatever.

2105
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:13,000
They turned into Harry Potter World.

2106
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:15,000
That was the More Friends concert.

2107
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:17,000
That More Friends concert, not good.

2108
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:18,000
Well, this one, they said, it says,

2109
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:20,000
we're at the final, this is a tweet there,

2110
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:22,000
we're at the Final Fantasy VII concert, it's a legit scam,

2111
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:25,000
two-thirds of it has been them playing the MIDI from the game.

2112
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:28,000
They didn't say anywhere in the advertising that the orchestra

2113
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:31,000
would be sitting in pure silence, wasting everyone's time,

2114
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:34,000
as they're literally playing fucking MIDI.

2115
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:36,000
Oh, dear.

2116
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:38,000
Oh, dear.

2117
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:41,000
I hope, oh, gosh, that does not sound good.

2118
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:43,000
I'll be curious for more information on that.

2119
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:44,000
But anyway, we're gonna move on.

2120
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:47,000
We do have some more news that's outside of just the press conferences

2121
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:48,000
we've been talking about so far.

2122
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:51,000
There's more news showing up this week, so, Loki.

2123
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:54,000
So they've got a new Yooka-Laylee trailer that's out now

2124
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:58,000
for a brand new game, Yooka-Laylee and the Impossible Lair,

2125
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:00,000
and it looks pretty cool.

2126
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:03,000
It's kind of the same style as Donkey Kong Country.

2127
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:10,000
It's a pure side-scroller as opposed to a kind of 3D platform game.

2128
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:13,000
Awesome, because I think Donkey Kong Country is awesome,

2129
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:15,000
and I would love to see that sort of thing make a comeback.

2130
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:20,000
Yes, I know Tropical Freeze was a thing, but I'd be curious.

2131
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:24,000
It looks cool. I mean, I'd be willing to check this out, so neat.

2132
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:26,000
Yeah, very cool.

2133
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:28,000
Are they doing a Kickstarter for it, or is it just happening?

2134
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:29,000
I think it's just happening.

2135
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:31,000
That's cool.

2136
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:36,000
All right, well, moving on to some sources and things

2137
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:38,000
that are coming out of Blizzard.

2138
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:42,000
Blizzard has apparently cancelled a StarCraft first-person shooter.

2139
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:45,000
This first-person shooter was in development over the last two years.

2140
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:50,000
It has apparently been confirmed by Kotaku with three people

2141
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:53,000
in the studio familiar with what's going on.

2142
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:57,000
The reason for this, Blizzard is taking those resources

2143
01:40:57,000 --> 01:41:00,000
and putting them into Diablo and Overwatch.

2144
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:05,000
So the inevitable Diablo 4, which we know will be a thing eventually,

2145
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:09,000
not on mobile phones, and some sort of Overwatch 2,

2146
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:12,000
of which I know there's a lot of rumors that Overwatch 2

2147
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:18,000
is going to take a PvE element to it as well as the PvP,

2148
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:20,000
although obviously this is not a story about Overwatch 2,

2149
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:24,000
but we have heard a little bit of the rumble, rumble, rumble for that.

2150
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:27,000
The new StarCraft game was codenamed Ares.

2151
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:31,000
It was supposed to be a battlefield game in the StarCraft universe.

2152
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:35,000
It sounds like the Overwatch engine may have been leveraged

2153
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:38,000
in making this game, which is a pretty smart idea, right?

2154
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:40,000
Why not take this first-person shooter over here?

2155
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:42,000
Why not take the engine to make this own thing?

2156
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:45,000
So battlefield in the StarCraft universe, that would have been kind of rad, probably.

2157
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:47,000
But unfortunately, I guess it didn't happen.

2158
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:51,000
Apparently, folks were shocked within Blizzard that this game got canceled

2159
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:53,000
because apparently it was looking pretty good.

2160
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:55,000
Here's the interesting thing.

2161
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:58,000
Kotaku reached out to Blizzard for comment.

2162
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:02,000
99% of the time when you contact these companies for comment, what do you get?

2163
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:04,000
We don't comment on rumors and speculation, right?

2164
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:06,000
That's not what Kotaku got back.

2165
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:09,000
Blizzard said, we don't generally comment on unannounced projects,

2166
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:11,000
but we will say the following.

2167
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:14,000
We always have people on different ideas behind the scenes,

2168
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:17,000
including multiple projects right now, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

2169
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:20,000
We pour our heart and souls into this work, and as players ourselves,

2170
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:24,000
we know how exciting it can be to see and know with certainty

2171
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:26,000
that a new project is coming.

2172
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:28,000
Knowing that changes or disappointments can happen

2173
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:31,000
doesn't make it any less painful when we have to shelve a project

2174
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:33,000
or when an announcement doesn't go as planned.

2175
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:35,000
Why are they saying this if it ain't true?

2176
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:38,000
Yeah, it's a little bit more than we don't comment on rumors.

2177
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:39,000
Yeah, a little more than that, right?

2178
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:40,000
Et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

2179
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:43,000
With all that said, we're very much looking forward to revealing other things

2180
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:46,000
we're working on when the time is right,

2181
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:49,000
which brings me to why this cancellation is your fault.

2182
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:52,000
Not you specifically, but gamers.

2183
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:53,000
So here's the thing.

2184
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:57,000
Now, granted, the game may have actually been messy on the inside.

2185
01:42:57,000 --> 01:42:58,000
I don't know.

2186
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:01,000
But I think the important thing about this is that those resources

2187
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:04,000
were shifted to Diablo and Overwatch,

2188
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:08,000
and that is because after that negative reception

2189
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:10,000
that they got from the last BlizzCon,

2190
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:13,000
which is in big part Blizzard's own fault

2191
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:15,000
and Activision's fault, I'm sure, as well,

2192
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:20,000
but I think after the internet collectively dragged them through the mud

2193
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:23,000
for not having a new Diablo game and so on,

2194
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:26,000
it is imperative at Blizzard,

2195
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:28,000
and this is how they got to fix that BlizzCon.

2196
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:29,000
It is imperative.

2197
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:31,000
It is priority number one at Blizzard right now,

2198
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:36,000
I'm speculating, that Diablo 4 fucking happens at this BlizzCon,

2199
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:39,000
and it came at this cost,

2200
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:42,000
because they needed the resources in order to have Diablo 4

2201
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:45,000
something that you can see at this year's BlizzCon,

2202
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:48,000
and so that's why StarCraft getting cancelled, I believe,

2203
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:50,000
is in part the internet's fault.

2204
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:52,000
Now, granted, one could argue, well,

2205
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:54,000
Blizzard should have never brought a half-assed thing to BlizzCon in the first place,

2206
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:58,000
but did you have to drag them that bad?

2207
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:02,000
Did you have to get up on stage and actually ask to the guy's face,

2208
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:04,000
which was a little bit disrespectful,

2209
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:07,000
is this an April Fool's joke that's out of season?

2210
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:09,000
What do you think?

2211
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:11,000
So.

2212
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:15,000
Well, to be, well, to play devil's advocate,

2213
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:19,000
I'm sure that they felt a little bit entitled,

2214
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:23,000
because they paid money to be at that event,

2215
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:27,000
is why they felt entitled to see something that they wanted to see

2216
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:30,000
versus, like, this is what we have to show you,

2217
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:32,000
too bad that you don't like it.

2218
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:35,000
Some folks in chat making the joke,

2219
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:37,000
I think I must admit I've seen before,

2220
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:40,000
StarCraft Ghost cancelled for a second time, in a way.

2221
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:43,000
Wouldn't that have been ironic if this game had been StarCraft Ghost,

2222
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:45,000
because it didn't have a name?

2223
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:47,000
How about that? Can you imagine if,

2224
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:49,000
let's fan-wank for a minute,

2225
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:51,000
because we already know this isn't going to happen,

2226
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:53,000
but if they had done this BlizzCon, they do this unveil,

2227
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:56,000
and the title comes up, it's StarCraft Ghost.

2228
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:57,000
And people would have been like,

2229
01:44:57,000 --> 01:44:58,000
What?

2230
01:44:58,000 --> 01:44:59,000
That's exactly,

2231
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:00,000
What?

2232
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:05,000
They would have lost their mind that StarCraft Ghost was resurrected.

2233
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:06,000
Right?

2234
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:07,000
I don't know.

2235
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:09,000
I think people would have went crazy.

2236
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:11,000
And Slidekick is in our chat and wants to know,

2237
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:14,000
OMG Rob, are you drinking from a Gwen Stefani cup?

2238
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:15,000
Yes, I am.

2239
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:18,000
I got this when we saw the Vegas residency show.

2240
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:21,000
I'm surprised you can see that on Twitch,

2241
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:22,000
probably because we're zoomed in tonight.

2242
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:24,000
We're zoomed in a little bit on the Twitch picture,

2243
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:26,000
because Jamie's not here, so we don't have to be over the shoulder,

2244
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:29,000
so we have a little tighter shot on Loki and I,

2245
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:31,000
so I guess you can even see what's written on the cup,

2246
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:32,000
so there you go.

2247
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:33,000
Yes, you can.

2248
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:34,000
You can look right there.

2249
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:35,000
Oh yes, I can also just look at the TV,

2250
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:36,000
but I'm trying not to do that,

2251
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:38,000
because when I look over here, it looks weird,

2252
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:39,000
so I'm trying to look at you.

2253
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:40,000
All right, anyway.

2254
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:43,000
Mistake Theory in chat says,

2255
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:44,000
Well, maybe I'm just uninitiated,

2256
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:46,000
but I don't know what StarCraft Ghost is.

2257
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:49,000
Hey, good call, because that was a long time ago, right?

2258
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:52,000
So StarCraft Ghost was a StarCraft spin-off game

2259
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:54,000
that they were making, and it was like a shooty game.

2260
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:56,000
It was behind, you know, because StarCraft isn't like that.

2261
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:59,000
StarCraft is like Warcraft in space, right?

2262
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:00,000
It's a tactical game,

2263
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:02,000
but they were going to do another game in that universe

2264
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:04,000
that was like over the shoulder, right?

2265
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:05,000
It was Nova, right?

2266
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:06,000
It was starring her, I think,

2267
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:07,000
and it was like a shooty game,

2268
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:11,000
and it was being developed for Nintendo 64, PlayStation 1?

2269
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:12,000
It was old.

2270
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:13,000
PlayStation 2, I guess.

2271
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:14,000
It was old.

2272
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:15,000
It was being made for, you know,

2273
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:18,000
maybe it was PlayStation 2 in that era of games,

2274
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:20,000
because it would have been like the mid-late 90s,

2275
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:23,000
because Bobby saw it a long time ago in Atlanta.

2276
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:25,000
So it would have been like, what, 98 or something like that.

2277
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:27,000
So it was around that time.

2278
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:29,000
So, yeah, it was a while ago.

2279
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:30,000
Yeah, Quest Buster confirms there.

2280
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:32,000
Yeah, in the late 90s.

2281
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:34,000
Yeah, so, all right.

2282
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:35,000
So there you go.

2283
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:37,000
Unfortunate to hear about that cancellation at Blizzard,

2284
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:38,000
but who knows?

2285
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:40,000
Maybe the game will come back,

2286
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:42,000
and Diablo 4, I guess,

2287
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:44,000
is almost certain to be a BlizzCon announcement this year.

2288
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:46,000
Maybe Overwatch 2 as well,

2289
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:49,000
but don't get your hopes up.

2290
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:53,000
Don't do it, because it's a dangerous thing to do.

2291
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:55,000
Loki, what do you have for us?

2292
01:46:55,000 --> 01:47:00,000
So there's this Apple event that was going on.

2293
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:04,000
So they had talked a little bit about TVOS,

2294
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:09,000
and, of course, the new things that are going to be coming to that,

2295
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:12,000
which I think was one of those is the,

2296
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:14,000
was it they called the Apple Arcade or whatever that was?

2297
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:15,000
Yeah.

2298
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:16,000
So part of that, though,

2299
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:19,000
they were saying that there was going to be support with TVOS

2300
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:21,000
for third-party controllers.

2301
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:25,000
So Xbox One and PlayStation 4 controllers have support,

2302
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:28,000
so you can actually use those to play games on TVOS

2303
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:31,000
and the games that are on there.

2304
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:32,000
So, neat.

2305
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:34,000
I mean, that makes sense.

2306
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:36,000
Yeah, and assuming, you know,

2307
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:37,000
they're just assuming, I guess,

2308
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:39,000
that a lot of homes have those controllers already.

2309
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:40,000
Probably.

2310
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:41,000
So maybe, unlike Google Stadia,

2311
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:42,000
they're like,

2312
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:43,000
well, we don't really need to sell a separate one.

2313
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:44,000
Well, and to be fair,

2314
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:45,000
in Google Stadia's case,

2315
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:47,000
it also supports those controllers, too.

2316
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:49,000
It's just that they have an extra one that they're going to sell, too,

2317
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:52,000
that ties into the network and all that stuff, whatever.

2318
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:55,000
But Apple maybe doesn't see a need to reinvent the wheel.

2319
01:47:55,000 --> 01:47:57,000
They figure, oh, people have these devices in their home already.

2320
01:47:57,000 --> 01:47:59,000
Let's just make, you know, it's all Bluetooth anyway.

2321
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:02,000
Let's just make our device work with it, which seems pretty smart,

2322
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:05,000
especially if Apple Arcade is going to have, you know,

2323
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:07,000
more games that require a controller.

2324
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:10,000
So what I'm really curious to see is when we start seeing these games

2325
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:12,000
that are on Apple Arcade,

2326
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:15,000
maybe they're not going to be necessarily just touchscreen games.

2327
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:17,000
Yeah, I would hope so.

2328
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:24,000
Otherwise, it doesn't really seem like a very promising platform.

2329
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:25,000
Yeah.

2330
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:28,000
So very curious to see more on that

2331
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:32,000
and how that develops and what type of games are on Apple Arcade in the future.

2332
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:35,000
Moving on, I'm surprised I didn't give this story to you.

2333
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:37,000
I guess I ran out of spots.

2334
01:48:37,000 --> 01:48:38,000
I know you're the Borderlands fan,

2335
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:41,000
but feel free to comment on this further if you'd like.

2336
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:44,000
But it was announced that Borderlands 2 is officially,

2337
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:46,000
because I think it was leaked early on, but they confirmed it.

2338
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:49,000
Yeah, it leaked out onto the Steam store.

2339
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:52,000
That Borderlands 2 would get new DLC,

2340
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:55,000
and it's in anticipation of Borderlands 3's release.

2341
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:59,000
The Borderlands 2 DLC is Commander Lilith and the fight for Sanctuary.

2342
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:01,000
And yeah, leaked out to Steam,

2343
01:49:01,000 --> 01:49:04,000
but then it was confirmed during the Microsoft event today

2344
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:09,000
that, yeah, this DLC is upping the game's level cap to 80,

2345
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:12,000
and you can just start a new character at level 30 if you want

2346
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:13,000
to just jump right into it.

2347
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:15,000
So that's pretty cool.

2348
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:16,000
So yeah.

2349
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:17,000
Out the plate.

2350
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:18,000
Yeah.

2351
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:21,000
Now, they're saying that this...

2352
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:22,000
Did it just come out today?

2353
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:23,000
I think so, yeah.

2354
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:24,000
No, that's good, because I was going to say,

2355
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:26,000
if it doesn't release soon,

2356
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:29,000
then there's not going to be a lot of time to enjoy it before Borderlands 3 comes out.

2357
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:33,000
Yeah, because today was also when they put it on Games Pass as well.

2358
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:34,000
So it's available.

2359
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:38,000
Games Pass also has the DLC and everything's available,

2360
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:40,000
and then this is available as well for free.

2361
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:41,000
So you get that.

2362
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:42,000
Yeah.

2363
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:43,000
Pretty cool.

2364
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:47,000
So I'm still on Borderlands 1,

2365
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:49,000
making my way slowly to Borderlands 2,

2366
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:51,000
so I probably won't get to this anytime soon,

2367
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:53,000
but is this something you might check out?

2368
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:54,000
Yeah, I might.

2369
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:57,000
I probably should start Borderlands 2.

2370
01:49:57,000 --> 01:49:58,000
That's going to be the case.

2371
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:00,000
Metal Mayhem points out the DLC's free too.

2372
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:01,000
Yeah.

2373
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:03,000
Which, if it's a big advertisement for the third game,

2374
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:07,000
in a way, then it makes sense that you might put that out there for free

2375
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:11,000
to try to make sure you get those $60 pre-orders from Borderlands 3, right?

2376
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:12,000
Yeah.

2377
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:15,000
And maybe some limited edition sales and so forth as well.

2378
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:17,000
Loki, you got one more story for us, right?

2379
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:21,000
Yeah, so this is a little bit of a preview of what we might see tomorrow with Ubisoft,

2380
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:26,000
but apparently there is a leak that a game called Watchdog Legion

2381
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:29,000
is going to be announced tomorrow,

2382
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:33,000
and it's supposed to be the brand new Watchdogs game

2383
01:50:33,000 --> 01:50:35,000
where it's going to allow you to play as anyone,

2384
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:38,000
every individual you meet in the open world,

2385
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:41,000
has a full set of animations, voiceover, character traits,

2386
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:46,000
and visuals that are generated and guided by gameplay systems.

2387
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:52,000
So that's how they're describing it according to the Amazon UK listing for this.

2388
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:54,000
So neat that that would be a thing.

2389
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:56,000
I don't know how exactly that plays into it.

2390
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:59,000
The new game is supposed to take place in London,

2391
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:01,000
so I guess we'll find out tomorrow,

2392
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:04,000
which I'm sure this will be a big part of the announcement,

2393
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:09,000
or they're going to have, I would imagine, a big portion of the Ubisoft event dedicated to this.

2394
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:15,000
Of course, not before they have a really awkward fucking dance number for Just Dance,

2395
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:19,000
because they do that every fucking year, and it's goddamn annoying.

2396
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:22,000
And I'm sure this year will be no different.

2397
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:25,000
Yeah, I'm going to just, well, I have to work tomorrow anyway,

2398
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:28,000
and I'm not going to try to watch these things while I'm at work.

2399
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:31,000
I'll look at the bullet points, though, which you missed a little later on.

2400
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:33,000
There's some good YouTube trailers to see. I'll look at those.

2401
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:36,000
But the Square Enix one is probably the only one I'm going to watch live,

2402
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:40,000
because I wonder if they'll announce a release date for Final Fantasy VII Remake.

2403
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:41,000
I wonder.

2404
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:42,000
Maybe.

2405
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:44,000
That would make a lot of sense.

2406
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:46,000
They got Sony's slot.

2407
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:49,000
I wonder if they might be announcing anything from PlayStation 4 tomorrow

2408
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:51,000
that might be a big deal for this year.

2409
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:54,000
Or early next year, maybe.

2410
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:57,000
All right, anyway, we're about to get to our Discord calls,

2411
01:51:57,000 --> 01:52:01,000
so if you want to join our Discord over at voggenetwork.com slash Discord,

2412
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:03,000
that'll get you an invite to the server.

2413
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:05,000
We'll be taking those calls in just a little bit

2414
01:52:05,000 --> 01:52:07,000
if you want to join our Green Room channel

2415
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:09,000
and tell us what you want to call in about tonight

2416
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:11,000
in our channel, Orange Lounge Radio.

2417
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:16,000
But first, I'm sure you guys have seen this story floating around the Internet.

2418
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:20,000
There is going to be Xbox Body Wash coming out. That's right.

2419
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:23,000
Are they going to hand that out at E3?

2420
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:24,000
Let's hope.

2421
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:28,000
Some personal hygiene products called Xbox Links,

2422
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:30,000
which is funny because Atari had a system called the Links,

2423
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:32,000
and it's spelled L-Y-N-X. Yeah, right.

2424
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:35,000
So, the Xbox Links.

2425
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:39,000
Links is what they call Axe in Australia.

2426
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:41,000
So, like Axe Body Spray.

2427
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:43,000
That's what they call it in Australia.

2428
01:52:43,000 --> 01:52:47,000
So, assumably, if this product is coming stateside as well,

2429
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:50,000
it's going to be Microsoft Axe as well.

2430
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:53,000
However, a representative did say,

2431
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:56,000
there are no plans to offer this in the U.S. at this time.

2432
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:58,000
However, we would certainly love to.

2433
01:52:58,000 --> 01:53:02,000
So, this may only be a thing that's going to be Australia, New Zealand, China,

2434
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:04,000
or something like that.

2435
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:07,000
It is a nice, bright green color,

2436
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:10,000
because if you've ever seen Axe Body Wash sitting on the shelf,

2437
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:13,000
it's always these giant fluorescent colors.

2438
01:53:13,000 --> 01:53:16,000
There's crazy blue and screaming yellow,

2439
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:19,000
and just screaming Mr. Smoosh in the background over there.

2440
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:22,000
Screaming yellow and red and all these very bright colors.

2441
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:26,000
So, this bright green that they're looking at doing the Xbox Links in

2442
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:27,000
is no different.

2443
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:32,000
But how do you feel about game makers getting into body washes?

2444
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:37,000
It makes sense, and if it gets some people aware to bathe themselves,

2445
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:39,000
then I'm all for it.

2446
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:42,000
I just couldn't help but laugh my ass off

2447
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:45,000
when this was the first thing I saw after I read that article

2448
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:48,000
about how some dude wants to do a straight pride parade in Boston.

2449
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:55,000
I was like, oh, Xbox Axe, here's some official gear.

2450
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:58,000
Although, I don't know if you saw what Axe Body Spray said

2451
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:00,000
to somebody on Twitter,

2452
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:03,000
but I've got to say, props to Axe.

2453
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:08,000
Axe posted a happy pride like a lot of corporations do this month,

2454
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:10,000
and of course they got that response that was like,

2455
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:13,000
gay people shouldn't be celebrated, blah, blah, blah.

2456
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:16,000
And Axe responded something to the effect of,

2457
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:17,000
I don't have it right in front of me,

2458
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:18,000
Axe responded something to the effect of,

2459
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:21,000
gay rights are human rights, but go off, Jill.

2460
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:28,000
And as much as I'm not a big fan

2461
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:32,000
of the humanizing of brand accounts on Twitter

2462
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:35,000
because they're everywhere, that one was fucking funny.

2463
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:41,000
I always appreciate a good dragging

2464
01:54:41,000 --> 01:54:44,000
of somebody who is completely wrong on that issue.

2465
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:48,000
Anyway, SheHulk10 in chat says,

2466
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:51,000
I would like to smell like a new Xbox.

2467
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:59,000
Does it smell like burning components?

2468
01:54:59,000 --> 01:55:02,000
Does the red ring of death smell?

2469
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:04,000
They don't say what it smells like.

2470
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:07,000
It smells like green, I guess, I don't know.

2471
01:55:07,000 --> 01:55:08,000
Green.

2472
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:09,000
Yeah, it's that.

2473
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:12,000
Anyway, I will check in to see if there's any last minute stories,

2474
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:14,000
but some folks in chat are commenting on Mr. Smoosh.

2475
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:17,000
S2 and Hunter Matt saying, Mr. Smoosh has E3 breaking news.

2476
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:18,000
Feed me and give me attention.

2477
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:19,000
Can you guys hear?

2478
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:20,000
That is really loud.

2479
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:21,000
He's very, very big.

2480
01:55:21,000 --> 01:55:24,000
He knows it's about dinner time,

2481
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:27,000
and his other dad should be home right now to feed him,

2482
01:55:27,000 --> 01:55:30,000
but my understanding is that his other dad

2483
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:33,000
is in line at Target right now, so he's not home yet.

2484
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:37,000
So, I think Mr. Smoosh is just very anxious for some wet food,

2485
01:55:37,000 --> 01:55:41,000
even though the fat boy got dry food just a couple hours ago, didn't he?

2486
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:43,000
You want to come make a cameo?

2487
01:55:43,000 --> 01:55:44,000
Mr. Smoosh?

2488
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:45,000
Smoosh?

2489
01:55:45,000 --> 01:55:47,000
You want to come make a cameo?

2490
01:55:47,000 --> 01:55:48,000
I'm going to try.

2491
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:49,000
He's like, no.

2492
01:55:49,000 --> 01:55:50,000
No, he's just going to stay out of there and look.

2493
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:51,000
Sorry, guys.

2494
01:55:51,000 --> 01:55:52,000
All right.

2495
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:53,000
Anyway.

2496
01:55:53,000 --> 01:55:54,000
He'll come to me.

2497
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:55,000
Oh, is he coming over?

2498
01:55:55,000 --> 01:55:56,000
That doesn't mean he'll get picked up on cam, though.

2499
01:55:56,000 --> 01:55:59,000
He's got to get up on the couch in order to get up on cam.

2500
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:01,000
Well, maybe he can come up here.

2501
01:56:01,000 --> 01:56:02,000
Look, I got food.

2502
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:03,000
Food over here.

2503
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:04,000
How's that?

2504
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:05,000
He smells of food.

2505
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:07,000
All right, we're going to get to a call while Loki continues

2506
01:56:07,000 --> 01:56:09,000
to try to placate Mr. Smoosh here.

2507
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:13,000
Let's get to it, and then I'll ask for a last minute story.

2508
01:56:13,000 --> 01:56:14,000
But first, we have a call.

2509
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:15,000
Hi, you're on Orange Moms Radio.

2510
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:16,000
Who's this?

2511
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:17,000
Hey, what's going on, everyone?

2512
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:18,000
I hit you on the...

2513
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:19,000
Hey, Rama.

2514
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:20,000
Good to hear from you.

2515
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:21,000
Wow, you're coming through loud.

2516
01:56:21,000 --> 01:56:23,000
Sorry if it's echoing back to those of you that are listening live.

2517
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:25,000
I'll try to adjust the volume on the fly.

2518
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:27,000
What's on your mind tonight, buddy?

2519
01:56:27,000 --> 01:56:30,000
Not too much, and I'm also adjusting the volume on the fly on my end, too,

2520
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:32,000
just to be on the safe side.

2521
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:33,000
No worries.

2522
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:34,000
What's on your mind tonight?

2523
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:35,000
All right.

2524
01:56:35,000 --> 01:56:41,000
I saw the Microsoft compressor, and I was done at PSO2.

2525
01:56:41,000 --> 01:56:44,000
I was absolutely done.

2526
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:47,000
Did you see the opening to tonight's show?

2527
01:56:47,000 --> 01:56:51,000
I probably missed it because I was on my way back from another outing

2528
01:56:51,000 --> 01:56:55,000
because I had been out all week, and as soon as I came home...

2529
01:56:55,000 --> 01:56:56,000
It's all right.

2530
01:56:56,000 --> 01:56:57,000
It's all right.

2531
01:56:57,000 --> 01:56:58,000
Go back and watch it.

2532
01:56:58,000 --> 01:57:00,000
Hopefully, somebody clipped it, but if they didn't, then go back

2533
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:02,000
and watch it at some point.

2534
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:03,000
I will.

2535
01:57:03,000 --> 01:57:05,000
I will.

2536
01:57:05,000 --> 01:57:08,000
So you're excited about PSO2 as well?

2537
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:09,000
Yes.

2538
01:57:09,000 --> 01:57:11,000
I mean, they put it frankly.

2539
01:57:11,000 --> 01:57:12,000
I'm like...

2540
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:13,000
I'm watching here.

2541
01:57:13,000 --> 01:57:14,000
I'm like, no.

2542
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:15,000
No way.

2543
01:57:15,000 --> 01:57:16,000
No way.

2544
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:17,000
Then I go, wait.

2545
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:18,000
That's not a carrier.

2546
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:19,000
No, no, no, no.

2547
01:57:19,000 --> 01:57:20,000
That's got to be PSO2.

2548
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:21,000
Right in there.

2549
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:25,000
I looked at the screen, and I looked at my laundry.

2550
01:57:25,000 --> 01:57:26,000
The fresh laundry.

2551
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:27,000
Screen.

2552
01:57:27,000 --> 01:57:28,000
Yeah.

2553
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:30,000
I changed my underwear after seeing that.

2554
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:32,000
I was done.

2555
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:36,000
So you are also hype about PSO2.

2556
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:40,000
I expressed a reservation that this game's been out for years and years

2557
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:41,000
and years.

2558
01:57:41,000 --> 01:57:42,000
How are they going to keep it fresh and interesting?

2559
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:44,000
Do you have any reservations of that sort?

2560
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:47,000
Or are you just like, no, just put it in my veins?

2561
01:57:47,000 --> 01:57:48,000
Not really.

2562
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:50,000
I mean, the fact that it's going to be free to play

2563
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:52,000
and they're giving us all of the expansions,

2564
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:56,000
I think they're going to do right by us.

2565
01:57:56,000 --> 01:57:57,000
Yeah.

2566
01:57:57,000 --> 01:58:02,000
I'm just trying not to get my expectations up too high

2567
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:06,000
so that I'm pleasantly surprised when it exceeds my low expectations,

2568
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:11,000
which I think is a good thing to do in general, right?

2569
01:58:11,000 --> 01:58:15,000
Basically, go in expecting the best but preparing for the worst.

2570
01:58:15,000 --> 01:58:16,000
Yeah.

2571
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:19,000
So did anything else at the Microsoft Presser catch your eye,

2572
01:58:19,000 --> 01:58:23,000
or is it like everything else is a blur because of that?

2573
01:58:23,000 --> 01:58:26,000
Battletoads, I was like, oh, yeah?

2574
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:27,000
For real?

2575
01:58:27,000 --> 01:58:28,000
Okay.

2576
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:29,000
Game on.

2577
01:58:29,000 --> 01:58:33,000
What did you think about the Game Pass that they're offering?

2578
01:58:33,000 --> 01:58:38,000
The $14.99 a month gold plus Game Pass on Xbox plus Game Pass on PC?

2579
01:58:38,000 --> 01:58:43,000
Because I have to admit, the fact that now Game Pass is on PC

2580
01:58:43,000 --> 01:58:47,000
and it's bundled with like Xbox Live for the console and then the Xbox,

2581
01:58:47,000 --> 01:58:49,000
I'm kind of interested, I think.

2582
01:58:49,000 --> 01:58:50,000
What were your thoughts?

2583
01:58:50,000 --> 01:58:53,000
I kind of feel Microsoft is spreading themselves thin with that,

2584
01:58:53,000 --> 01:58:57,000
but on the same token, they're trying to incorporate everybody.

2585
01:58:57,000 --> 01:59:00,000
But I don't game enough to say that this is a worth value,

2586
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:03,000
so if anybody else is going to get it,

2587
01:59:03,000 --> 01:59:06,000
they'll probably enjoy it a lot better than I would.

2588
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:08,000
Fair enough. Fair enough.

2589
01:59:08,000 --> 01:59:11,000
Well, anything else you want to say about Microsoft's event tonight?

2590
01:59:11,000 --> 01:59:13,000
Cyberpunk 2077, bro.

2591
01:59:13,000 --> 01:59:15,000
Yeah, that game looks pretty hot.

2592
01:59:15,000 --> 01:59:18,000
What about Keanu?

2593
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:20,000
Now, y'all know me.

2594
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:23,000
I am the cheap gamer.

2595
01:59:23,000 --> 01:59:26,000
You have to have a really good reason for me to go out

2596
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:30,000
and buy a game day one and pay it a $60 price.

2597
01:59:30,000 --> 01:59:34,000
I was already looking into picking up 2077.

2598
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:37,000
I really enjoyed the trailer from last year

2599
01:59:37,000 --> 01:59:39,000
and the 45-minute game playthrough.

2600
01:59:39,000 --> 01:59:42,000
I'm like, okay, I'm going to enjoy this.

2601
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:45,000
This was just the icing on the cake for me.

2602
01:59:45,000 --> 01:59:46,000
Yeah, for sure.

2603
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:51,000
I think Keanu is a nice cherry on top of this dessert

2604
01:59:51,000 --> 01:59:54,000
many people were waiting for already, so it was very, very awesome.

2605
01:59:54,000 --> 02:00:01,000
The real question is, though, since this is a game where you can romance people,

2606
02:00:01,000 --> 02:00:03,000
are you going to be able to romance Keanu Reeves?

2607
02:00:03,000 --> 02:00:05,000
Oh, yeah. One of my friends wrote a tweet that said,

2608
02:00:05,000 --> 02:00:09,000
when do I get to fuck Keanu Reeves?

2609
02:00:09,000 --> 02:00:12,000
And I just retweeted it. I thought it was funny.

2610
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:15,000
I might have to find that tweet and retweet it my own self.

2611
02:00:15,000 --> 02:00:19,000
Yes. All right. Well, Rama, anything else on your mind tonight?

2612
02:00:19,000 --> 02:00:22,000
In response to the article about Xbox body wash,

2613
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:26,000
the irony is when that article first popped up,

2614
02:00:26,000 --> 02:00:31,000
I have been seeing this grassroots campaign

2615
02:00:31,000 --> 02:00:38,000
to telling people when you go to conventions, shower, wash yourself, shower, do that.

2616
02:00:38,000 --> 02:00:41,000
And it's like, this is popping up.

2617
02:00:41,000 --> 02:00:44,000
I'm like, you know, even Microsoft is telling you,

2618
02:00:44,000 --> 02:00:47,000
you need to leave the game room for five minutes,

2619
02:00:47,000 --> 02:00:53,000
go up to your room, shower, come back downstairs, and then game some more.

2620
02:00:53,000 --> 02:00:56,000
Rama, I wouldn't expect you to know of this YouTube celebrity,

2621
02:00:56,000 --> 02:00:59,000
but I'm going to share this YouTube celebrity for you.

2622
02:00:59,000 --> 02:01:01,000
This particular celebrity is very famous right now

2623
02:01:01,000 --> 02:01:04,000
because there's a little short clip circulating around the internet

2624
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:08,000
where she goes, and her name is Jasmine Masters,

2625
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:10,000
and she's an amazing queen from RuPaul's Drag Race.

2626
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:13,000
And she has this whole series, and you just need to find it on YouTube

2627
02:01:13,000 --> 02:01:16,000
where she talks about, you need to wash your ass,

2628
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:18,000
and you need to scrub your balls.

2629
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:20,000
And she goes this whole thing on it,

2630
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:22,000
and I think it's something that should be required viewing

2631
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:24,000
before going to a convention.

2632
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:28,000
She's not gone. I'm telling you, she's not gone.

2633
02:01:29,000 --> 02:01:32,000
I walked into the game room,

2634
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:36,000
and I felt like my mother slapped the living shit out of me

2635
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:39,000
because of how strong that funk was.

2636
02:01:39,000 --> 02:01:42,000
I'm like, I should have brought my console from home

2637
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:44,000
and stayed in my damn room.

2638
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:48,000
God, I can tell you stories of the fanboy funk.

2639
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:54,000
If I ever, if I ever get to the day where VOG Network has a convention,

2640
02:01:54,000 --> 02:01:57,000
I'm going to have that Jasmine Masters videos on loop

2641
02:01:57,000 --> 02:01:58,000
in the registration line.

2642
02:01:58,000 --> 02:02:00,000
Please do. I mean, there are already,

2643
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:03,000
there was this convention in the mid-Atlantic, Midwest,

2644
02:02:03,000 --> 02:02:08,000
Colossal Kong, they were giving out small things of deodorant.

2645
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:11,000
You didn't have, there wasn't, it was like, here, take it.

2646
02:02:11,000 --> 02:02:12,000
You know?

2647
02:02:12,000 --> 02:02:15,000
Nifty 805 in chat says,

2648
02:02:15,000 --> 02:02:19,000
I remember that gamer X attendees smell lovely.

2649
02:02:19,000 --> 02:02:21,000
We'll just do this.

2650
02:02:21,000 --> 02:02:26,000
Instead of bomb sniffing dogs, we'll get like B.O. sniffing dogs,

2651
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:29,000
and so they can sniff out the people that are really rank,

2652
02:02:29,000 --> 02:02:33,000
and we can like, yeah.

2653
02:02:33,000 --> 02:02:35,000
Dog is very disturbed by your smells, sir.

2654
02:02:35,000 --> 02:02:37,000
You can have eggs at the line.

2655
02:02:37,000 --> 02:02:38,000
Wow.

2656
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:42,000
Speaking of all this, did you see SacAnime this weekend downtown?

2657
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:43,000
I heard that it was going on.

2658
02:02:43,000 --> 02:02:44,000
I heard it was going on.

2659
02:02:44,000 --> 02:02:47,000
They had SacAnime the same freaking, okay,

2660
02:02:47,000 --> 02:02:49,000
so usually I can't go to SacAnime

2661
02:02:49,000 --> 02:02:51,000
because it's the same weekend as Dragon Con, right?

2662
02:02:51,000 --> 02:02:53,000
So they move it to a different date this year,

2663
02:02:53,000 --> 02:02:55,000
and they put it the same weekend as Pride.

2664
02:02:56,000 --> 02:02:59,000
Well, there's multiple Prides going on in New York.

2665
02:02:59,000 --> 02:03:01,000
Like, last Sunday was Queen's Pride.

2666
02:03:01,000 --> 02:03:06,000
I'm going to New York Pride at the end of the month as the token straight,

2667
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:08,000
so, you know.

2668
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:10,000
Allies are important.

2669
02:03:10,000 --> 02:03:12,000
It's good to have them close, yeah.

2670
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:13,000
True.

2671
02:03:13,000 --> 02:03:14,000
All right.

2672
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:16,000
Well, Rama, I'm going to let you go,

2673
02:03:16,000 --> 02:03:19,000
but before I do let you go, I just want to remind you, Rama,

2674
02:03:19,000 --> 02:03:21,000
you're breathtaking.

2675
02:03:21,000 --> 02:03:23,000
Aw, I get it from y'all.

2676
02:03:23,000 --> 02:03:25,000
I learn it from y'all, so, you know.

2677
02:03:25,000 --> 02:03:26,000
Excellent.

2678
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:27,000
Excellent response.

2679
02:03:27,000 --> 02:03:28,000
I approve.

2680
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:29,000
All right.

2681
02:03:29,000 --> 02:03:30,000
Take care, buddy.

2682
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:31,000
It's always good to hear from you.

2683
02:03:31,000 --> 02:03:32,000
Later, fam.

2684
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:33,000
Bye.

2685
02:03:33,000 --> 02:03:34,000
All right.

2686
02:03:34,000 --> 02:03:35,000
Do we have any?

2687
02:03:35,000 --> 02:03:37,000
I don't see anybody else in the green room right now,

2688
02:03:37,000 --> 02:03:39,000
but do we have any other stories to talk about?

2689
02:03:39,000 --> 02:03:40,000
Yes.

2690
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:42,000
Let's talk about some of the stuff from Devolver Digital.

2691
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:44,000
Yes, since they've been going on,

2692
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:46,000
and we kind of were doing a show about that.

2693
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:48,000
So this is an announcement I was not expecting.

2694
02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:50,000
So, you know, enter the Gungeon.

2695
02:03:50,000 --> 02:03:54,000
Well, they announced a brand-new game in the enter the Gungeon series

2696
02:03:54,000 --> 02:03:59,000
called Enter the Gungeon House of the Gun Dead.

2697
02:03:59,000 --> 02:04:00,000
Nice.

2698
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:03,000
It's an arcade shooter game.

2699
02:04:03,000 --> 02:04:04,000
Oh, that's kind of cool.

2700
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:05,000
It's an arcade gun game.

2701
02:04:05,000 --> 02:04:06,000
So it's separate.

2702
02:04:06,000 --> 02:04:07,000
It's not DLC or something.

2703
02:04:07,000 --> 02:04:09,000
It's going to be in arcades.

2704
02:04:09,000 --> 02:04:11,000
Oh, shit.

2705
02:04:11,000 --> 02:04:12,000
That's pretty cool.

2706
02:04:12,000 --> 02:04:13,000
Yes.

2707
02:04:13,000 --> 02:04:14,000
Oh, nice.

2708
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:16,000
So I am totally down for that.

2709
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:17,000
That's really cool.

2710
02:04:17,000 --> 02:04:18,000
And then, of course,

2711
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:21,000
they announced a Devolver bootleg collection.

2712
02:04:21,000 --> 02:04:25,000
It's all these bootleg games of their games.

2713
02:04:25,000 --> 02:04:26,000
It's hilarious.

2714
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:28,000
They did like Enter the Gun Dungeon,

2715
02:04:28,000 --> 02:04:32,000
or Hotline Milwaukee, Ape Out Junior.

2716
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:34,000
So they took a bunch of people that hacked their games?

2717
02:04:34,000 --> 02:04:37,000
No, I think they made their own bootleg games of their own games.

2718
02:04:37,000 --> 02:04:38,000
Oh, okay.

2719
02:04:38,000 --> 02:04:39,000
That's so weird.

2720
02:04:39,000 --> 02:04:40,000
Shooty Boots,

2721
02:04:41,000 --> 02:04:44,000
Super Absolver Mini Turbo Fighting Championship,

2722
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:45,000
Catsylvania.

2723
02:04:45,000 --> 02:04:46,000
It's a cat game.

2724
02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:47,000
Catsylvania?

2725
02:04:47,000 --> 02:04:49,000
It's a cat inside of a suit of armor.

2726
02:04:49,000 --> 02:04:51,000
It's a cat in full-played armor.

2727
02:04:51,000 --> 02:04:53,000
What else do you want?

2728
02:04:53,000 --> 02:04:55,000
Just that game, TBH.

2729
02:04:55,000 --> 02:04:56,000
I want that.

2730
02:04:56,000 --> 02:04:58,000
Luft Trousers,

2731
02:04:58,000 --> 02:04:59,000
Pee-book,

2732
02:04:59,000 --> 02:05:00,000
Pekoo,

2733
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:02,000
Pekoo Ball Stars.

2734
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:04,000
I have no idea what that is.

2735
02:05:04,000 --> 02:05:05,000
But it sounds hilarious.

2736
02:05:05,000 --> 02:05:08,000
And it's on Steam right now for $4.94

2737
02:05:08,000 --> 02:05:09,000
for eight games.

2738
02:05:09,000 --> 02:05:11,000
I heard it's 1% off right now.

2739
02:05:11,000 --> 02:05:12,000
1% off, yes.

2740
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:13,000
1% off.

2741
02:05:13,000 --> 02:05:14,000
That's a pretty good price.

2742
02:05:14,000 --> 02:05:16,000
Oh, there we go.

2743
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:18,000
More late-breaking news just coming in.

2744
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:20,000
So, you know how we're supposed to hear the date

2745
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:22,000
of the Final Fantasy VII Remake at that concert?

2746
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:23,000
Yeah.

2747
02:05:23,000 --> 02:05:24,000
It just came out.

2748
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:26,000
March 3rd, 2020 was announced as the date.

2749
02:05:26,000 --> 02:05:27,000
March 3rd, 2020.

2750
02:05:27,000 --> 02:05:29,000
So, it was this winter,

2751
02:05:29,000 --> 02:05:31,000
but it's like the last days of winter.

2752
02:05:31,000 --> 02:05:33,000
So, but there it is.

2753
02:05:33,000 --> 02:05:35,000
March 3rd, 2020 Final Fantasy VII Remake.

2754
02:05:35,000 --> 02:05:36,000
It's happening.

2755
02:05:37,000 --> 02:05:38,000
Cool.

2756
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:40,000
I'm not gonna lie.

2757
02:05:40,000 --> 02:05:41,000
I'm gonna be there day one.

2758
02:05:41,000 --> 02:05:42,000
I'm excited for it.

2759
02:05:42,000 --> 02:05:44,000
I know a lot of y'all love to hate on VII,

2760
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:45,000
and that's fine,

2761
02:05:45,000 --> 02:05:48,000
but I'm really excited to kind of check it out

2762
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:49,000
with these souped-up graphics

2763
02:05:49,000 --> 02:05:51,000
and sort of like for a new generation there.

2764
02:05:51,000 --> 02:05:52,000
So, it's really, really cool.

2765
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:54,000
I was gonna say other things that I saw this week

2766
02:05:54,000 --> 02:05:55,000
that were pretty cool.

2767
02:05:55,000 --> 02:05:58,000
They announced the remake for Destroy All Humans,

2768
02:05:58,000 --> 02:05:59,000
which is awesome.

2769
02:05:59,000 --> 02:06:01,000
And Romshine in the trailer, of course.

2770
02:06:01,000 --> 02:06:03,000
It's gonna be fantastic.

2771
02:06:05,000 --> 02:06:09,000
They have a remake of the SpongeBob,

2772
02:06:09,000 --> 02:06:13,000
Battle for Bikini Bottom or something that they're doing.

2773
02:06:13,000 --> 02:06:14,000
That's kind of random.

2774
02:06:14,000 --> 02:06:15,000
I'm surprised.

2775
02:06:15,000 --> 02:06:17,000
I know Activision has like...

2776
02:06:17,000 --> 02:06:19,000
They need to do a SpongeBob meme game.

2777
02:06:19,000 --> 02:06:21,000
There's so many SpongeBob memes now.

2778
02:06:21,000 --> 02:06:23,000
There's the whole like the all caps

2779
02:06:23,000 --> 02:06:26,000
when you say something sarcastically back to somebody,

2780
02:06:26,000 --> 02:06:27,000
that whole thing.

2781
02:06:27,000 --> 02:06:28,000
And then now I'm seeing one

2782
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:30,000
where they put SpongeBob in like all these weird,

2783
02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:31,000
I don't even know,

2784
02:06:31,000 --> 02:06:34,000
it's like these weird places and scenery and yeah.

2785
02:06:34,000 --> 02:06:37,000
And it's like me when I show up to the place alone,

2786
02:06:37,000 --> 02:06:38,000
or something like that.

2787
02:06:38,000 --> 02:06:39,000
SpongeBob memes are everywhere,

2788
02:06:39,000 --> 02:06:41,000
so you should make a game out of it.

2789
02:06:41,000 --> 02:06:42,000
Yeah.

2790
02:06:42,000 --> 02:06:44,000
Or Sonic the Hedgehog memes.

2791
02:06:44,000 --> 02:06:45,000
Yes.

2792
02:06:46,000 --> 02:06:47,000
Perfect.

2793
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:49,000
So, yeah.

2794
02:06:49,000 --> 02:06:51,000
I guess that's it.

2795
02:06:51,000 --> 02:06:53,000
That's all I got for now.

2796
02:06:53,000 --> 02:06:54,000
I mean, I'm sure there's stuff

2797
02:06:54,000 --> 02:06:55,000
that we're forgetting out there.

2798
02:06:55,000 --> 02:06:56,000
Yeah.

2799
02:06:56,000 --> 02:06:57,000
They talked about Carrion.

2800
02:06:57,000 --> 02:06:58,000
That was another announcement

2801
02:06:58,000 --> 02:06:59,000
that they have for Devolver Digital,

2802
02:06:59,000 --> 02:07:00,000
but that one's kind of cool.

2803
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:02,000
It's a reverse horror game.

2804
02:07:02,000 --> 02:07:04,000
You play like almost like The Thing,

2805
02:07:04,000 --> 02:07:06,000
and you're going around and infecting people

2806
02:07:06,000 --> 02:07:09,000
into this giant, amorphous, massive body parts,

2807
02:07:09,000 --> 02:07:11,000
and it's kind of horrific,

2808
02:07:11,000 --> 02:07:14,000
but fun because you're attacking people.

2809
02:07:14,000 --> 02:07:15,000
Yeah.

2810
02:07:15,000 --> 02:07:16,000
Okay.

2811
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:17,000
Yeah.

2812
02:07:17,000 --> 02:07:18,000
Good times.

2813
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:19,000
All right.

2814
02:07:19,000 --> 02:07:20,000
Well, I don't see any other calls waiting on the line,

2815
02:07:20,000 --> 02:07:21,000
so I guess we'll move to start

2816
02:07:21,000 --> 02:07:22,000
to wrap things up here a little bit,

2817
02:07:22,000 --> 02:07:24,000
even though for being E3 week,

2818
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:25,000
it was a little bit of a shorter show.

2819
02:07:25,000 --> 02:07:27,000
But we're only part way through E3.

2820
02:07:27,000 --> 02:07:29,000
There's still so much more news to come,

2821
02:07:29,000 --> 02:07:30,000
so it's a bummer we have to wait

2822
02:07:30,000 --> 02:07:31,000
all the way till next Sunday

2823
02:07:31,000 --> 02:07:32,000
to talk about it again.

2824
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:35,000
But of course, you can always follow the show on Twitter,

2825
02:07:35,000 --> 02:07:37,000
at OLR, or my personal Twitter,

2826
02:07:37,000 --> 02:07:38,000
at MrRobRoberts.

2827
02:07:38,000 --> 02:07:39,000
Loki's on Twitter,

2828
02:07:39,000 --> 02:07:40,000
at LokiOLR.

2829
02:07:40,000 --> 02:07:42,000
And then Dark Soccer is also on Twitter as well,

2830
02:07:42,000 --> 02:07:43,000
at Dark Soccer,

2831
02:07:43,000 --> 02:07:44,000
although she tends to be more

2832
02:07:44,000 --> 02:07:47,000
of a Facebook-y slash Tumblr person,

2833
02:07:47,000 --> 02:07:49,000
which we missed Dark Soccer tonight,

2834
02:07:49,000 --> 02:07:51,000
but she will be back to join us next week.

2835
02:07:51,000 --> 02:07:53,000
And of course, in seven days,

2836
02:07:53,000 --> 02:07:56,000
we'll know what Nintendo's got planned for the next year.

2837
02:07:56,000 --> 02:07:57,000
Animal Crossing.

2838
02:07:57,000 --> 02:07:58,000
Yeah, let's Animal Crossing.

2839
02:07:58,000 --> 02:08:01,000
You think we'll get any surprises out of Nintendo

2840
02:08:01,000 --> 02:08:03,000
and what they do?

2841
02:08:03,000 --> 02:08:04,000
The funny thing is,

2842
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:05,000
for those that listen on the podcast,

2843
02:08:05,000 --> 02:08:07,000
some people are gonna hear this,

2844
02:08:07,000 --> 02:08:09,000
possibly after Nintendo's already done their thing,

2845
02:08:09,000 --> 02:08:11,000
and how stupid these predictions might be.

2846
02:08:11,000 --> 02:08:12,000
But anything-

2847
02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:13,000
Okay, let's make predictions then.

2848
02:08:13,000 --> 02:08:14,000
Why not?

2849
02:08:14,000 --> 02:08:16,000
All right, what do you think Nintendo's gonna do?

2850
02:08:16,000 --> 02:08:18,000
They're gonna have Animal Crossing.

2851
02:08:18,000 --> 02:08:21,000
They're gonna talk about Pokemon again a little bit.

2852
02:08:21,000 --> 02:08:24,000
They may talk about Mario Maker 2 a little bit.

2853
02:08:24,000 --> 02:08:26,000
I think as far as I'm concerned,

2854
02:08:26,000 --> 02:08:30,000
we're gonna see maybe something for Bayonetta 3,

2855
02:08:30,000 --> 02:08:36,000
and I would be willing to bet Minecraft Steve for Smash.

2856
02:08:36,000 --> 02:08:38,000
Okay, Minecraft Steve for Smash.

2857
02:08:38,000 --> 02:08:39,000
That's an interesting one.

2858
02:08:39,000 --> 02:08:42,000
Let's see, for me, Animal Crossing's a given.

2859
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:46,000
Link's Awakening remake is on the lanyards at E3, apparently,

2860
02:08:46,000 --> 02:08:47,000
so that's definitely gonna be a focus.

2861
02:08:47,000 --> 02:08:48,000
Right, I would expect that would be...

2862
02:08:48,000 --> 02:08:50,000
They could be talking a little bit more of that.

2863
02:08:50,000 --> 02:08:52,000
I thought that would be more of a treehouse thing.

2864
02:08:52,000 --> 02:08:53,000
Yeah.

2865
02:08:53,000 --> 02:08:55,000
No, I think especially now that Metroid Prime 4

2866
02:08:55,000 --> 02:08:57,000
kind of fell off the calendar for them,

2867
02:08:57,000 --> 02:08:59,000
I think there are probably gonna be other games

2868
02:08:59,000 --> 02:09:00,000
that they're kind of boosting up

2869
02:09:00,000 --> 02:09:03,000
to kind of make sure that this holiday is okay for them.

2870
02:09:03,000 --> 02:09:06,000
Super Nintendo games, maybe for...

2871
02:09:06,000 --> 02:09:07,000
Here's hoping.

2872
02:09:07,000 --> 02:09:08,000
Nintendo Channel tipping.

2873
02:09:08,000 --> 02:09:10,000
Yeah, for the Famicom channel.

2874
02:09:10,000 --> 02:09:12,000
Or the Famicom channel.

2875
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:13,000
You know what I mean.

2876
02:09:13,000 --> 02:09:14,000
Switch online.

2877
02:09:14,000 --> 02:09:15,000
NES.

2878
02:09:15,000 --> 02:09:16,000
They should do Nintendo 64.

2879
02:09:16,000 --> 02:09:18,000
They should just do all these things.

2880
02:09:18,000 --> 02:09:20,000
Super Nintendo games would be great.

2881
02:09:20,000 --> 02:09:23,000
I'd really be excited for that.

2882
02:09:23,000 --> 02:09:25,000
Secret of Mana remake.

2883
02:09:25,000 --> 02:09:26,000
We are... Not the remake.

2884
02:09:26,000 --> 02:09:27,000
The collection.

2885
02:09:27,000 --> 02:09:28,000
Second Densetsu collection.

2886
02:09:28,000 --> 02:09:31,000
I'm gonna put stock that that's probably real.

2887
02:09:31,000 --> 02:09:33,000
Could that be a Square Enix thing?

2888
02:09:33,000 --> 02:09:35,000
Ooh, yeah, we may hear about that tomorrow

2889
02:09:35,000 --> 02:09:36,000
at Square Enix thing.

2890
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:37,000
That's true.

2891
02:09:37,000 --> 02:09:38,000
So I'm gonna hope that that's real

2892
02:09:38,000 --> 02:09:39,000
and coming out on the Switch,

2893
02:09:39,000 --> 02:09:40,000
and that's gonna be the first time

2894
02:09:40,000 --> 02:09:41,000
we get Second Densetsu 3,

2895
02:09:41,000 --> 02:09:43,000
and that's gonna be a big fucking deal.

2896
02:09:43,000 --> 02:09:45,000
You talk about Phantasy Star Online 2 being old

2897
02:09:45,000 --> 02:09:46,000
and us finally getting it,

2898
02:09:46,000 --> 02:09:48,000
and that's gonna be the first time

2899
02:09:48,000 --> 02:09:50,000
we get Second Densetsu 3 being old and us finally getting it.

2900
02:09:50,000 --> 02:09:52,000
Let's talk about Second Densetsu 3, okay?

2901
02:09:52,000 --> 02:09:54,000
That'll be a pretty big fucking deal.

2902
02:09:54,000 --> 02:09:55,000
So there's that.

2903
02:09:55,000 --> 02:09:57,000
And I'm trying to think.

2904
02:09:57,000 --> 02:10:00,000
I would say I think I'm gonna go with something,

2905
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:02,000
and Flacco had said this on Twitter,

2906
02:10:02,000 --> 02:10:03,000
and I think we're due for it.

2907
02:10:03,000 --> 02:10:05,000
I think a new Splatoon game could happen.

2908
02:10:05,000 --> 02:10:10,000
Because we know the final Splatoon 2 is happening.

2909
02:10:10,000 --> 02:10:13,000
The final Splatfest for Splatoon 2 is happening.

2910
02:10:13,000 --> 02:10:15,000
Thank you, Alan.

2911
02:10:15,000 --> 02:10:16,000
Product placement.

2912
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:17,000
My God, Alan brought me snackies.

2913
02:10:17,000 --> 02:10:19,000
Oh, the Caramel one? Yeah.

2914
02:10:19,000 --> 02:10:21,000
Yeah, the Caramel ones are hella good.

2915
02:10:21,000 --> 02:10:23,000
Anyway, but they didn't pay me to say that.

2916
02:10:25,000 --> 02:10:27,000
Oh, so I think it's Splatoon 3.

2917
02:10:27,000 --> 02:10:29,000
Why not? We're ready.

2918
02:10:29,000 --> 02:10:32,000
I was gonna say, as far as Square Enix goes,

2919
02:10:32,000 --> 02:10:35,000
Final Fantasy XI Mobile?

2920
02:10:35,000 --> 02:10:38,000
Eh? When the hell is that gonna be announced?

2921
02:10:38,000 --> 02:10:40,000
And let's just throw something way out there.

2922
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:42,000
Chugua Racing mobile game.

2923
02:10:42,000 --> 02:10:45,000
I don't want them to talk about Final Fantasy XIV.

2924
02:10:45,000 --> 02:10:48,000
Because we already know everything from Final Fantasy XIV expansion.

2925
02:10:48,000 --> 02:10:50,000
Don't retread that ground tomorrow.

2926
02:10:50,000 --> 02:10:54,000
Unless they're gonna announce Final Fantasy XIV for the Xbox One.

2927
02:10:54,000 --> 02:10:56,000
I think we're due for another Hitman game.

2928
02:10:56,000 --> 02:10:58,000
Could be that.

2929
02:10:58,000 --> 02:10:59,000
Yeah, that'd be good too.

2930
02:10:59,000 --> 02:11:02,000
Alright, well that's gonna do it for another episode of Orange Country.

2931
02:11:02,000 --> 02:11:05,000
We will be back in seven days to recap the second half of E3

2932
02:11:05,000 --> 02:11:07,000
and all these things that we're thinking about now.

2933
02:11:07,000 --> 02:11:11,000
And then of course you guys hopefully to chat along with us here in chat.

2934
02:11:11,000 --> 02:11:13,000
And Dark Soccer will be back as well.

2935
02:11:13,000 --> 02:11:14,000
And we'll have a good old time.

2936
02:11:14,000 --> 02:11:15,000
Enjoy E3.

2937
02:11:15,000 --> 02:11:17,000
Anybody that we know that happens to be there,

2938
02:11:17,000 --> 02:11:19,000
we hope that you're having a good time at the show.

2939
02:11:19,000 --> 02:11:23,000
And have a drink for us at one of the fun after parties in the area.

2940
02:11:23,000 --> 02:11:25,000
And it'll be a good time.

2941
02:11:25,000 --> 02:11:27,000
So, final thoughts time.

2942
02:11:27,000 --> 02:11:29,000
You have a final thought for us, Loki.

2943
02:11:29,000 --> 02:11:31,000
It's funny, in chat they say,

2944
02:11:31,000 --> 02:11:35,000
I predict Loki will delete the code to time the car live on stream

2945
02:11:35,000 --> 02:11:38,000
to stop people from mentioning it before Half-Life 3 comes out.

2946
02:11:38,000 --> 02:11:41,000
Funny enough, I would actually play that game on stream

2947
02:11:41,000 --> 02:11:44,000
I thought that the modern Unity can open it up

2948
02:11:44,000 --> 02:11:47,000
and actually I can render it as an executable.

2949
02:11:47,000 --> 02:11:49,000
But I don't know if I can.

2950
02:11:49,000 --> 02:11:50,000
I'll try it.

2951
02:11:50,000 --> 02:11:53,000
But I think you'll break it if I try to import it into...

2952
02:11:53,000 --> 02:11:55,000
Because I did that in Unity 5.

2953
02:11:55,000 --> 02:11:57,000
And we're like on 2019 now.

2954
02:11:57,000 --> 02:12:01,000
So I'd have to dig up a really old copy of Unity in order to open that up.

2955
02:12:01,000 --> 02:12:02,000
Fair enough.

2956
02:12:02,000 --> 02:12:03,000
Or actually it might have been Unity 4.

2957
02:12:03,000 --> 02:12:05,000
I don't know. It's really old.

2958
02:12:05,000 --> 02:12:08,000
As I always say, towards the end of every episode of Orange Country Radio,

2959
02:12:08,000 --> 02:12:09,000
help us spread the word.

2960
02:12:09,000 --> 02:12:10,000
Tell a friend or two about the show.

2961
02:12:10,000 --> 02:12:12,000
Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice

2962
02:12:12,000 --> 02:12:15,000
but only if the voices are here to be able to air out there.

2963
02:12:15,000 --> 02:12:18,000
I know we've been getting some new people coming in and watching

2964
02:12:18,000 --> 02:12:19,000
so we really appreciate that.

2965
02:12:19,000 --> 02:12:22,000
Hope you'll stick with us here at VoG Network.

2966
02:12:22,000 --> 02:12:23,000
Really appreciate that.

2967
02:12:23,000 --> 02:12:26,000
Auto hosts go a long way.

2968
02:12:26,000 --> 02:12:29,000
So if you're not already auto hosting our channel on Twitch at VoG Network,

2969
02:12:29,000 --> 02:12:30,000
please consider doing so.

2970
02:12:30,000 --> 02:12:31,000
It really helps us out a lot.

2971
02:12:31,000 --> 02:12:35,000
And Bobby, we're not just held up because of my entry into VoG Jam 1.

2972
02:12:35,000 --> 02:12:38,000
We're also held up because of Rob's entry into VoG Jam 1.

2973
02:12:38,000 --> 02:12:39,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2974
02:12:39,000 --> 02:12:41,000
At least I finally played him at some point.

2975
02:12:41,000 --> 02:12:42,000
So there is that.

2976
02:12:42,000 --> 02:12:44,000
You can't give me shit about that anymore.

2977
02:12:44,000 --> 02:12:47,000
We've come a long way, I suppose.

2978
02:12:47,000 --> 02:12:50,000
Alright, well that's going to do it for another episode of Orange Country Radio.

2979
02:12:50,000 --> 02:12:53,000
Oh, my official final thought is M&M's.

2980
02:12:53,000 --> 02:12:54,000
Yay, candy.

2981
02:12:54,000 --> 02:12:55,000
Just what I need.

2982
02:12:55,000 --> 02:12:56,000
The caramel ones are pretty good.

2983
02:12:56,000 --> 02:12:57,000
Sugar rush right before I go to bed.

2984
02:12:57,000 --> 02:12:58,000
You know what's not good though?

2985
02:12:58,000 --> 02:12:59,000
What?

2986
02:12:59,000 --> 02:13:01,000
The raw cookie dough place I went to the other day

2987
02:13:01,000 --> 02:13:03,000
where they serve cookie dough like ice cream.

2988
02:13:03,000 --> 02:13:05,000
You'd think that would be good.

2989
02:13:05,000 --> 02:13:07,000
It is too much.

2990
02:13:07,000 --> 02:13:08,000
Oh, I went to a place like that in Vegas.

2991
02:13:08,000 --> 02:13:09,000
It wasn't bad.

2992
02:13:09,000 --> 02:13:10,000
I liked it.

2993
02:13:10,000 --> 02:13:14,000
It was sickening how rich and sugary that is.

2994
02:13:14,000 --> 02:13:15,000
Alright.

2995
02:13:15,000 --> 02:13:18,000
Well, on that note, we hope to be back in seven days
