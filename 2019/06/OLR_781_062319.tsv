7000	14000	There's your hosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
14000	28000	This week, Battle Royale stretched back closer to console gaming's origins, more context given to some of the month's biggest announcements, and in happy coincidence of our 17th anniversary, Cadence of Hyrule can be played as a dancing game. Happy birthday, OLR, and thank you for all these years.
28000	32000	Orange Lounge Radio
58000	65000	Here in studio on the show, myself, Rob Roberts, joining you here, as well as DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.
65000	66000	Hey.
66000	67000	Hi, how are you?
67000	70000	I'm full of regret.
70000	74000	You looked surprised that I asked you that question, even though you would think, you know.
74000	77000	No, I had to think about it because, like, I still want that damn unagi.
77000	86000	Good, I'm glad that you, look, I'm glad that DarkSakura is the type of person that will actually think about her answer to the question, then just say fine, like, do that right, how are you, fine.
86000	87000	How are you, you know what?
87000	88000	This is not fine.
88000	89000	Everything is rotten.
89000	92000	Everything's not awesome.
92000	94000	I saw the second Logan movie.
94000	97000	Also joining us, of course, Tech Master, Loki.
97000	98000	Fine.
98000	103000	Hi, how are you?
103000	105000	You're a rat.
105000	121000	Yeah, so, as mentioned by Bobby before us, and you may have seen on Twitter, and maybe in our chat right now, because we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, at the Voice of the Geeks network, twitch.tv slash vog network, right after the Bobby Blackwell show.
121000	124000	And we have been taping this show various places.
124000	126000	The Twitch thing is a little bit newer.
126000	132000	It's been about six months on Twitch, but we've been taping this show various places, as you might have heard, for the past 17 years.
132000	137000	So, believe it or not, Orange and Orange Radio started on June 23, 2002.
137000	138000	That was our first episode.
138000	146000	I usually, I tell the history every few months or so in case we have new people that stumble into OLR, so I'll do that again tonight since it is a birthday show.
146000	161000	We all met in the gaming community for the game Dance Dance Revolution, which, you know, is a game where you stomp the arrows in time with the music, which was a derivative of Beatmania.
161000	162000	And Spider Stomp.
162000	168000	Yeah. And, you know, Konami's Bmoni or Beatmania Bmoni series had a whole slew of games.
168000	174000	So it was Guitar Freaks and Patapatapatadice and Poppin' Music, and there's plenty more.
174000	177000	There's newer ones, too, that you might see at arcades these days, especially if you ever go to round one.
177000	180000	Things like what, U-Beat is like kind of a newer one.
180000	182000	Sound Voltex, that's a relatively new one.
182000	184000	That was around in 2002.
185000	195000	But we originally started as a show dedicated to Dance Dance Revolution and all music games, because we were big fans of things like Parappa and Bust-A-Move Groove, depending on what country you're in.
195000	202000	And so, you know, we, so I was on a show for many years before OLR called Under Sedation.
202000	203000	Actually, not many years.
203000	204000	It was really only a couple of years.
204000	211000	I mean, it feels like many years because it was a while ago, and the show went on for many years after Travis moved, which is great.
211000	219000	But I was on, for a couple of years, a show called Under Sedation Live, which Travis had started as a Rocky Horror Picture Show pre-show.
219000	220000	Yeah, that lasted.
220000	221000	We were, it did last.
221000	224000	No, I meant like as just a Rocky show.
224000	227000	Oh, well, well, yeah, funny. It's funny because, yeah, you're right.
227000	236000	Like the Rocky Horror Picture Show and the shadow cast it was built for probably only went about another six months, a year and a half tops after he started that show.
236000	239000	But Travis went on for 10 years, you know, beyond that.
239000	242000	And so, you know, it was fun to be honest to Travis.
242000	250000	Oh, yeah. And part of how I knew Dark Sakura was that, you know, not only do we know each other for DDR, but Dark Sakura came and guessed it on USL a lot.
250000	251000	A lot.
251000	254000	Because, you know, it was kind of like Loki the first few weeks.
254000	256000	She just, you know, this is a little bit more toward the end.
256000	258000	And then I filled in for Jessica a couple of times.
258000	259000	Yeah, yeah.
259000	260000	So, yeah.
260000	265000	So anyway, but it got Jamie and I to talking about what if we had a thing like this?
265000	268000	So like how this is for Rocky Horror, but we do something for like DDR.
268000	269000	Yeah.
269000	272000	And we can talk about DDR tournaments and we can talk about, you know, all that type of stuff.
272000	275000	So that's where Orange Entrada was originally born.
275000	283000	And so for the first few years, and again, and those of you that have found the OLR archive that Dark Tetsuya has curated of the old episodes.
283000	289000	If you go back and listen, I'm not going to say don't listen to old OLR, but it was a very different show because.
289000	290000	Listen with a salt lick.
290000	296000	Yeah, it was well a we didn't know what we were doing because there weren't a lot of rules around live broadcasting at the time.
296000	302000	There really weren't because the big players like NPR and stuff weren't in it, you know, at all is a very underground type of thing.
302000	303000	And so there weren't a lot of rules.
303000	305000	And it was because it was more community.
305000	306000	It got off topic a lot.
306000	313000	Like we would talk a little bit about DDR, but then it was like, let's let's drink on air and see what happens when we have the microphones.
313000	315000	Like we did crazy stuff in the early years.
315000	316000	It was fun.
316000	317000	I don't regret any of it for sure.
317000	319000	And it brought us to where we are today.
320000	323000	But I think I did pay you back for your waffles.
323000	326000	I think over the years, our show just kind of refined a little bit.
326000	333000	And there did come a point when Konami kind of let the money kind of go away for a bit.
333000	334000	They tried to bring it back.
334000	335000	Here's the funny thing.
335000	338000	So like DDR Extreme had come out and what, like 2001.
338000	339000	Right. And our show.
339000	340000	No, no.
340000	341000	Two thousand two.
341000	343000	No, because our show started when Max 2 was out.
343000	344000	Yeah.
344000	346000	Stream came out like 2003, 2004.
346000	348000	So that probably powered our show for another year or two.
348000	350000	But then we kind of realized Konami is not putting anything out.
350000	352000	There's not a lot of music games coming out.
352000	353000	Music games are dying.
353000	355000	We are having a problem filling the show.
355000	359000	So we said and then this was right around the same time podcasting started.
359000	361000	So we were actually doing and people don't always realize this.
361000	363000	We were doing two shows for a bit.
363000	366000	We were doing our live orange on radio about music games.
366000	370000	And then we were doing our 20 minute to go edition.
370000	372000	Let's talk about all video.
372000	374000	We're talking about all the video game headlines.
374000	377000	And that's something people can download and it didn't last 20 minutes.
377000	379000	We were with the first episode did.
379000	382000	And then it was the next episode was 25 minutes than 30 minutes.
382000	384000	And before long, it was an hour.
384000	387000	So we were doing three hours and then another hour.
387000	390000	So there finally came a point finally when we said, you know what?
390000	394000	And I think this is after iTunes put podcasting in it.
394000	397000	And then like the to go edition skyrocketed.
397000	401000	We were never more popular than when iTunes put in podcasting because to go scar.
401000	407000	And we were sitting here with like, OK, we have 20 people that listen to all our live, which is great.
407000	409000	We love them. We love our all our family.
409000	414000	We have 2000 people that are downloading all our to go.
414000	422000	Yeah. Which of these shows has now taken over when we feel that creatively this show over here is kind of run its course.
422000	423000	And this is where the hot new shit's at.
423000	431000	So basically, I think at the beginning of 06 or so, we ended up fusing the shows into what you hear now, Orange Lounge Radio.
431000	441000	So but we still consider that we've been doing a weekly show since 2002, whether it's it's like a Pokemon that has evolved several times.
441000	444000	So this isn't even my final form. You know what?
444000	449000	You know what? It's more like Digimon where it can devolve to.
449000	462000	But then it will always re-evolve and then combine with another thing to form like, you know, another completely new fusion Digimon and then have like extra evolutions of those forms.
462000	465000	So, yeah, we're more Digimon.
465000	467000	But yeah, I mean, like so.
467000	470000	So the show's kind of evolved a few times over the 17 years.
470000	479000	So that's, you know, and then Dark Tetsuya says, and of course, in our chat, we do tape live every Sunday night at the Voicegeeks Network at twitch.tv slash vlog network.
479000	481000	And we have our live chat. We love hearing from the live listeners.
481000	488000	Dark Tetsuya says, for the record, I know there are a couple DDR themed podcasts out there, but I understand that's a niche audience, especially these days.
488000	493000	Oh, yeah. No, I've been well aware that things have come full circle and now there are DDR themed podcasts.
493000	496000	Yeah. And I know there's some there like even relatively new.
496000	501000	Well, and here's the funny thing. So we kind of said we're done with the music games specifically.
501000	508000	I mean, we'll always love music games. We still do, but we're going to focus on all games and then not not the network.
508000	513000	Although that became a thing later on, too, before vlog network, we're going to compass on all video games.
513000	521000	And then so what finally happened about probably two years after we fused the show, maybe even only one year.
521000	530000	It wasn't long after this little company, Red Octane, that we knew from putting out the peripherals here in the U.S. to play a lot of those import games.
530000	532000	They said, we're going to make this little game called Guitar Hero.
532000	539000	And before long, within probably another year of that, by the time Guitar Hero 2 and then Rock Band is like music games were coming back.
539000	543000	And then Konami was like, let's get back into this and DDR Super.
543000	548000	And it's like and then also it was like, we don't know what we're doing, even though we did know what we were doing.
549000	555000	And in the meantime, we've aged and we're not playing DDR in the arcades as much anymore.
555000	563000	And so now that I'm pushing 41 here, I don't exactly play nine foot DDR level songs like I used to.
563000	565000	I'd probably be thinner if I did.
565000	567000	I tried. I died.
567000	571000	Yeah, I just, you know, if I worked out, I can't do it like a lot.
571000	580000	But I, you know, it's now because of round one and because, you know, Konami, I think, kind of started to embrace their worldwide audience a little more and so on and so on.
580000	583000	I think it's like DDR is kind of back in some ways.
583000	589000	So if this is a passing of the torch of some folks to the new generation, then that is awesome.
589000	596000	And maybe someday they'll run out of news too, but they'll keep it going because they enjoy what they're doing and they'll find a new topic to talk about.
596000	599000	Not that I wish that upon DDR, but that's also the reality.
599000	605000	Nothing's going to last forever. Right. So except maybe this show.
605000	614000	I'm going to be 70 training some intern how to someday be a raging bitch.
614000	618000	Someday the other media will realize we're out here someday.
618000	622000	You know, that'll be terrible. I stopped caring about that a long time ago.
622000	627000	Someday my break will come. Is the reality of the situation. They're telling me I'm quiet.
627000	631000	Sorry, guys. I don't know what's going on. Maybe I have to turn up my volume a little bit.
631000	635000	But yeah, let me ask this question while I futz with my mic here live.
635000	639000	What keeps you guys motivated to do this show?
639000	641000	Boredom. This whole time. Boredom.
641000	644000	Boredom? Like you have nothing better to do? Not really.
644000	646000	Stubbornness?
646000	650000	Honestly, like I don't want to say boredom. Let me know how that sounds, guys.
650000	653000	I was joking about the boredom. Well, no, because I think there actually is something to that.
653000	658000	Because I think if we didn't have O.L.R., I'd be like, what do I do?
658000	661000	I know I do tonight. Like, what am I going to do on my Sunday night?
661000	665000	Like, it's just like after doing something for this long, it becomes kind of a hard habit.
665000	672000	I don't know. We can like go to Dave and Buster's and go play some DDR and then maybe go to Brookfield's afterwards.
672000	677000	We should do that anyway. The inevitable day this show ends because nothing lasts forever.
677000	683000	But even if it's in another 17 years or whatever, the inevitable day this show ends, I think that's how I'd like it to end.
683000	690000	I think I would just like us to all, like with the camera still running, we're just going to all put down our mics and just go to RVGL and play some DDR.
690000	697000	And that will be how the show ends. Well, it's not going to be RVGL because their DDR machine's broken and they were trying to sell it the last time I was there.
697000	701000	So it'll have to be something like round one at that point.
702000	708000	Oh, actually, at that point, we'll have a round one here. So maybe it'll be a little easier to find, you know, working DDR machines. So, yeah.
708000	715000	But anyway, yeah. So remind me, I'm forgetful sometimes, so remind me that that's how I wanted the show to end.
715000	716000	Okay.
717000	720000	When we get there. Loki, what about you? What's kept you motivated for 17 years?
720000	724000	I just wouldn't know what to do on my Sunday. And it's a good way to get away from the family.
725000	727000	It's like mini vacation.
727000	729000	I actually didn't give my answer.
729000	731000	I told you boredom was the joke.
731000	732000	Okay. So what's the real answer?
732000	741000	Stubbornness and being an outspoken woman in a still male patriarchal dominated industry.
742000	753000	No, I mean, legit. Like, you know, when we did go from 20 to 2000 listeners, legit came in some ugly shit and ignorant shit, really.
753000	759000	You know, and that's an unfortunate side effect of this industry that I feel like...
759000	762000	You just did something more original than get in the kitchen. I mean, fuck.
762000	768000	I could think of a lot more original patriarchal things to say like, go churn butter.
769000	775000	Or why are you not in the month house, you know, during your moon time or something?
775000	781000	Or like if you want ways to get at dark soccer and tell her how to be a better person, I've got a list, you guys.
781000	782000	Girl.
782000	783000	I'm just kidding. I adore you.
783000	784000	You're already perfect.
784000	786000	You know that. You know that. Anyway.
786000	787000	I will smack the bitch.
787000	797000	But if you can churn your own butter, I mean, that's a lot of butter. The potential for that is just like, that's like, that's elevating yourself to like, you know, I don't know.
798000	799000	Butter, butter nirvana.
799000	800000	I have churned butter before, by the way.
800000	807000	All right. Anyway, so happy 17 years to us and to all of you guys who've stuck by with us for 17 years.
807000	812000	So many of you guys have helped out, you know, just keeping the show going.
812000	819000	Your advice, your friendship, your, you know, participation really in our chat and when calling in at the show and all that.
819000	825000	Yeah, you just have been such an important part of the show and a huge part of the reason why we're still doing it.
825000	833000	And even if we've gone from 20 to 2000, back down to 34, it's fine.
833000	834000	You know what? It doesn't matter.
834000	838000	And actually, there's more that listen to. I honestly couldn't tell you how many people listen to this podcast.
839000	840000	I stopped, I stopped.
840000	842000	And on top of that internationally, I mean, geez.
842000	849000	And two things. One, I stopped looking at the numbers a long time ago and two, I forgot the password on how to look anyway.
852000	856000	But you know what? I don't, I don't care. I truly, truly don't care.
856000	858000	That's like my work, you know, with the voicemail there.
858000	862000	I got, I was out like for a while and they're like, you know, you really should change your voicemail.
862000	865000	I'm like, I don't remember how to do that. So I'm just gonna leave it.
865000	869000	It's your old hours, you know, like, eh, it's fine.
869000	873000	No one pays attention to that anyways. They just leave me a message.
873000	878000	They were really hyper about that when I still had to contend with voicemail at my job.
878000	879000	Oh, wow.
879000	883000	And then I took a different position where I don't have to deal with that crap.
883000	884000	All right.
884000	890000	So anyway, and yeah, I mean, Darth Socko is talking a little personal stuff there, but I think this show because of its length,
891000	894000	I have often been, I don't want to say criticized.
894000	899000	But when I go to these podcasting events where podcasters get together or anything and I talk about,
899000	902000	yeah, we do Orange On Radio. We run for about three hours every week.
902000	907000	People go, really? Really? People listen for three hours?
907000	908000	Yeah.
908000	912000	And I go, well, some do. Not everybody does. Not everybody's got time for that. Some do.
912000	915000	I was like, shouldn't podcasts be about an hour long?
915000	918000	And I'm just like, that's not the show we ever did.
918000	921000	Our show was kind of antiquated thinking.
921000	926000	Well, here's the thing. And I understand the whole like evolve or die and that whole thing.
926000	928000	And, you know, we've tried some things.
928000	930000	Oh, no, we'll make less money.
930000	935000	But here's the thing. One, our show didn't like start because of other podcasts.
935000	939000	We were more inspired by like traditional radio at the time.
939000	942000	And a lot of hosts on traditional radio go for three, four hours.
942000	943000	Yeah.
943000	945000	So that was not unheard of, really.
945000	948000	So that's where our roots really are, if you think about it.
948000	952000	And B, now that things have come full circle, we're back on Twitch.
952000	955000	I mean, think about some of your favorite Twitch streamers.
955000	959000	Are your Twitch streamers going for three or four hours at a time? Is that abnormal?
959000	961000	Not really. A lot. Go for it.
961000	963000	We got stamina for old folks.
963000	966000	Which is funny because when I do a Twitch stream at like an hour, I'm like, OK, I'm done.
966000	968000	I want to go do something else now.
968000	970000	I'm usually like that as well.
970000	974000	But then again, I'm playing DDR, so it's like it's like I want to die.
974000	979000	Yeah. So anyway, and look, hey, I'm glad you're here.
979000	983000	Whether you listen for an hour every week, whether you listen to the whole thing every week,
983000	986000	if you're here live, if you're here on the podcast, I don't care.
986000	989000	I'm just I'm grateful for your you being here and your support.
989000	992000	OK, one other question we're getting and then I swear we're going to get into our kickoff topic,
992000	994000	which is actually about video games.
994000	998000	So a lot of folks on Twitch are asking and I apologize to podcast listeners for this,
998000	1002000	but we have these things sitting on my desk and people are like, what the hell are those?
1002000	1004000	These are actually little cakes.
1004000	1005000	They're bunt cakes.
1005000	1007000	They're little bunt cakes in different flavors.
1007000	1011000	So Dark Soccer threatened last last week that she was going to get us little cakes to celebrate.
1011000	1013000	And they look like little spiders from a distance.
1013000	1016000	But it's the frosting. It's the way the frosting kind of sits on the cake.
1016000	1021000	I figured with three different cakes and with them being little, we don't have to marry one cake.
1021000	1023000	We can enjoy the flavors of all of the cake.
1023000	1025000	That's right. I'm very Polly with my cakes.
1025000	1029000	And I think that's the carrot cake because that's just that's carrot cake is the best.
1029000	1030000	Shut up.
1030000	1033000	But this one's red velvet, so, you know, that's my fave.
1033000	1035000	So you get boring old chocolate, Loki.
1035000	1036000	All right. Oh, darn.
1036000	1041000	It's basically the same thing that that one's dyed red and doesn't have cream cheese frosting on it.
1041000	1045000	All right. Anyway, let's get into some gaming news.
1045000	1050000	So the news cycle has slowed down a little bit because we are after E3 week.
1050000	1053000	So most of the big companies have put out all their big announcements at this point.
1053000	1057000	So we are going to be in a little bit of a lull for the next couple of weeks before things build up again.
1057000	1068000	However, we got a pretty big gaming bombshell dropped on us this past week with the release of Harry Potter Wizards Unite.
1068000	1075000	This is the new game from Niantic publishing it in collaboration with Portkey Games and I think Warner Brothers San Francisco.
1075000	1080000	This is it's Niantic's newest AR based game.
1080000	1083000	Niantic, of course, has been in AR gaming for several years.
1083000	1088000	They made a game called Ingress that many Android users kind of noticed was on their phones.
1088000	1095000	And they also made a game called Pokemon Go, which a couple of years ago in that first launch really like that was you.
1095000	1099000	I you know, again, I think you want to talk about 17 years worth of gaming.
1099000	1106000	I would say the launch of Pokemon Go is easily one of the top 10 things that has happened in gaming in the past 17 years.
1106000	1112000	Like the way people were out and about walking downtown and old town and stuff like that.
1112000	1115000	Like I had never seen anything like that in my life.
1115000	1121000	And probably won't again because the popularity of Pokemon Go, it kind of went down a little bit.
1121000	1125000	But it's certainly not dead. I'm going to beat Bobby Black Wolf to the comment in chat.
1125000	1127000	Pokemon Go is certainly not dead.
1127000	1131000	There's definitely people that still do the raids and do the collection and the events.
1131000	1134000	Community days still draw a lot of people out. I see a lot of that.
1134000	1137000	But every day was community day when the game first launched.
1138000	1145000	But now we have Harry Potter, Wizards Unite, which is kind of like, OK, well, let's take some of the things we've learned from these other games we've made.
1145000	1147000	And now let's put it into Harry Potter.
1147000	1153000	And so I'm curious how you guys have received Harry Potter, Wizards Unite.
1153000	1159000	And those of you that have played it, because I bet since so many of you tried Pokemon Go, a lot of you probably downloaded it and checked it out.
1159000	1162000	I'm guessing a lot of you did, but I'm curious what your thoughts are.
1162000	1165000	Dark Soccer, I'll start with you. Have you had a chance to play?
1165000	1169000	Yeah, I'm like level nine right now. I haven't been playing like a whole bunch because I've been busy.
1169000	1172000	Level nine's pretty good, though. That's no slouch.
1172000	1176000	Yeah, there's things that I like and don't like about it.
1176000	1186000	You know, I hate like the whole wigs and stuff that you can do because they don't quite fit right on like a real person.
1186000	1188000	Oh, those Snapchat filters?
1188000	1191000	I don't use Snapchat either because it's stupid.
1191000	1193000	Ooh, a spleen.
1193000	1203000	Yeah, so like, I like that it plays a lot differently than Pokemon Go.
1203000	1205000	Oh God, this is a high threat, too.
1205000	1213000	You know, but like I hate how arbitrary hitting your marks are on the one thing it can be.
1213000	1219000	Because, I mean, it's like you think that you're doing it perfectly and it's like, oh, you're fair.
1220000	1225000	Or, man, that one sucked. Marvelous! Perfect! What?
1225000	1231000	So, yeah, there's a few things that I don't like, but for the most part I'm having a lot of fun with it.
1231000	1232000	What about you, Loki?
1232000	1234000	I don't like it at all.
1234000	1236000	But you like Pokemon Go and you like Ingress, right?
1236000	1239000	I like Pokemon Go. Ingress is pretty good.
1239000	1247000	This just feels too, I know it's kind of stupid to call it a mobile game, but it feels too mobile game-ish, I guess.
1247000	1249000	It's very, like, cheap feeling.
1249000	1251000	Lots of opportunities to spend gold.
1251000	1255000	And like, I don't really know what I'm supposed to be doing in the game.
1255000	1259000	And I've tried playing it a few times. It's crashed a bunch of times on me.
1259000	1265000	And I just, I don't know, I'm just not really into it at all.
1265000	1273000	Like, I've tried several different times to play it and I just, I end up closing it out playing Pokemon Go a little bit.
1274000	1281000	I don't know, I thought I would like it, but it's just, I'm not huge into the Harry Potter universe either.
1281000	1284000	I wasn't huge into the Pokemon either, though, but I don't know.
1284000	1289000	Maybe I'll learn to like it, but nah, I don't see myself playing this very long.
1289000	1295000	It is a little weird to me how, like, you know, this game launches and then suddenly Niantic is like,
1295000	1300000	to celebrate the launch of Harry Potter Wizards Unite, we're going to do double AP in Ingress.
1300000	1308000	It's 1.975, 9 and 3 quarters, so it's 1.975 times XP, but virtually double AP, which is, that's huge.
1308000	1311000	Like, to be able to level faster in Ingress is a big deal.
1311000	1316000	So, they do that this weekend and then they're like, oh, in Pokemon Go, all the rewards from Go Fest,
1316000	1321000	like, what is it, like half egg watching, double candy, double XP, like, all these bonuses went into effect.
1321000	1326000	So, it's like, let's celebrate the launch of Harry Potter by making you want to play the other games.
1326000	1330000	Like, I don't know if I totally get that logic, but okay, whatever.
1330000	1332000	Yeah, they should have done that, like, next week.
1332000	1340000	Yeah. So, okay, I play, obviously, like, I love AR games. I've played a lot.
1340000	1347000	I've played a lot besides just the big ones that Niantic's done, like, Jurassic Park, the Walking Dead thing.
1347000	1349000	Like, I'll play the Minecraft game when that comes out.
1349000	1350000	What's that?
1350000	1351000	The Minecraft game when that comes out.
1351000	1353000	Yeah, I'll try the microphone too. You name it, I've probably tried it.
1353000	1357000	Draconius Go, Garfield Go, I had that installed on my phone for, like, three days.
1357000	1360000	Munzee, I've played a lot of them.
1360000	1364000	And I gotta say, Harry Potter, like, it's not perfect.
1364000	1368000	I'm definitely noticing the, like, way more opportunities to spend gold to do things, right?
1368000	1372000	Which is the real money, currency essentially, which you get a little bit, you get a little bit of gold,
1372000	1376000	but it's not a significant amount, for sure, to do everything you want to do.
1376000	1383000	But I think, as far as, like, where it's at day one, I think it's in a way better place than a lot of AR games are on day one.
1383000	1387000	To the point where, I gotta admit, when I first played it, I was like, okay, I'm, like, overwhelmed.
1387000	1389000	There's, like, too much ingredients.
1389000	1393000	Exactly. Like, I don't know what any of that stuff was, and that was very overwhelming.
1393000	1397000	That's kind of where, like, I don't really want to, like, I didn't have time to sit through it.
1397000	1398000	That's why you explore the world.
1398000	1405000	But I do think the tutorial, I agree with that in part, and I figured it out by just basically, like, trial and error.
1405000	1412000	And some internet sleuthing, because, you know, I didn't mention yet, but this game has already been out in Australia and New Zealand for about a month.
1412000	1418000	So, some folks down there have already written some guides and things that the rest of us, now that it's launching in more and more countries,
1418000	1422000	which I think they added, like, 22 more countries over the weekend.
1422000	1429000	Now that more and more are playing it, we can, like, you know, go to these different resources and look up, you know, what certain things mean.
1430000	1438000	But, I do think the tutorial could have been a little better in that regard, in walking you through some of these things, and the fact that it's just, like, wow, it's really overwhelming.
1438000	1440000	I skipped the tutorial.
1440000	1443000	Wow, I'm surprised you got through it.
1443000	1447000	Yeah, it, it, I don't know, I didn't think it was that hard at all to figure out.
1447000	1451000	I mean, and I'm not saying that, like, in any kind of, ooh, why did it take you so long?
1451000	1452000	Yeah.
1452000	1455000	But, like, I just kind of picked it up and could play right away.
1455000	1456000	Gotcha.
1456000	1477000	I figured out the battle thing on my own. I figured out, you know, the wand on my own. I figured out mixing, you know, because I read the descriptions of the, of the, uh, potions, and it, you manage your stuff the same way that the old sort of, uh, trades, not trades, but, um, transfers used to go before you could multi-tap on things for Pokemon Go.
1477000	1485000	So it's not, like, it, to me it was pretty intuitive, and on top of that, the, um, your profession system makes me think a lot of, like, Dragon Age.
1485000	1486000	Hmm.
1486000	1496000	So that made perfect sense to me, that you just have to get the right experience or right items to be able to level up your profession. You have to study, you know.
1496000	1505000	So, to me, it really, really seemed just very intuitive. It really seemed very intuitive to me.
1505000	1513000	I find, though, that I'm having a hard time understanding, like, uh, what should I throw away? What should I keep? You know what I mean?
1513000	1522000	I throw away the, what I do is I look at the ingredient list, and I see the ones that I have just, like, a bajillion ingredients on, and I've kind of gotten an idea for my rarities.
1522000	1529000	So, when I see, oh, I've got 50 things of pus, well, I'm gonna delete, you know, 40 of them.
1529000	1530000	That's fair.
1530000	1537000	When I see I have one, you know, wormwood or something, I think, oh, I can make a cup of absinthe. I'm kidding.
1537000	1541000	Um, I'm like, okay, I need to save more of these. I need to hold on to them.
1541000	1551000	And I look at my ingredient list for my potions, and I'm like, okay, well, this one thing I'm out of is probably the things I'm gonna need to hold on to. So.
1551000	1559000	Um, I've prepared some lists here before we get into the rest of the news we have this week, which, again, is a little light anyway.
1559000	1566000	Um, so for those people that kind of get burned out when we talk about mobile games, I will say, you know, this game has not been a slouch.
1566000	1572000	I believe I saw an article today that said the game made $300,000 its first day, which doesn't surprise me at all.
1572000	1575000	I wasn't seeing the crowds upon crowds of people.
1575000	1580000	But when I went to the park and was walking around, because, you know, you can get a lot of ins and stuff at the park.
1580000	1587000	There were definitely, like, I saw a family, and I saw a couple, and they were absolutely playing Harry Potter because I could kind of overhear them saying, you know, things like,
1587000	1592000	oh, you got to do that greenhouse and, you know, get that, do that with the plan.
1592000	1603000	And I also, yeah, I heard people near me when I was, like, waiting at my son's coding class playing Harry Potter as well, because I could hear their games playing, you know, the Harry Potter theme is very easy to spot.
1603000	1604000	That's true. It's very distinct.
1604000	1608000	I actually haven't played with any sound at all yet, so I can't critique voices or anything.
1608000	1609000	Gotcha.
1609000	1620000	But I wanted to go over here some things that I've noticed as a veteran AR gamer, because I've seen a lot of clicky journalist pieces out there that say,
1620000	1625000	Harry Potter, Wizards Unite is just a reskin of Pokemon Go with Harry Potter.
1625000	1631000	And when I read that, when I see that, I can tell right away, you haven't really played those games in depth.
1631000	1633000	They some lazy bitches.
1633000	1637000	Which is, you know, I understand not everybody goes, you know, so there's a lot of casual folks.
1637000	1643000	And certainly at first glance and you look at screenshots, you think, yeah, it does kind of look similar.
1643000	1645000	OK, instead of throwing balls, you're tracing things.
1645000	1647000	But I actually prepared a list.
1647000	1651000	Here's five ways that Harry Potter is different from Pokemon Go.
1651000	1653000	Number one, the battling.
1653000	1654000	Totally different.
1654000	1656000	And in my opinion, far better.
1656000	1657000	Yeah, it was fun.
1657000	1658000	Yeah.
1658000	1661000	Instead of like doing raids, basically, you do these towers.
1661000	1663000	You can go to a tower and it doesn't seem like-
1663000	1664000	Oh, I just meant the one on one battles.
1664000	1665000	Well, yeah.
1665000	1666000	Well, you have those two.
1666000	1667000	Sometimes they spawn in the wild.
1667000	1669000	Little purple icons will do battles, I find out.
1669000	1671000	So sometimes you get them in the wild.
1671000	1672000	Sometimes you go to the towers.
1672000	1674000	And I point here because there's one at the park over here.
1674000	1680000	You go there and I haven't quite figured out, like, it doesn't seem like the where the tower is is very important.
1680000	1684000	It's just what level you do in the tower and what stone you give it.
1684000	1690000	So the stone seems like a multiplier and the level you're doing seems like some type of reward.
1690000	1691000	I have not figured all that out yet.
1691000	1694000	I'm waiting for the min-maxer people to determine all that.
1694000	1698000	But when you actually do the fighting in Pokemon Go, it's this.
1698000	1700000	Tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap.
1700000	1701000	Yeah, which is annoying.
1701000	1702000	That's how you fight in Pokemon Go.
1702000	1707000	Which, you know, for where mobile AR games were at two years ago, that's what they did.
1707000	1709000	And it was- it's fine at the time.
1709000	1710000	But this one is definitely evolved.
1710000	1714000	Like, you know, you have the little reticle, which is for aiming your wand.
1714000	1716000	And it's not just where you tap on the screen.
1716000	1717000	And this took me a minute to figure out.
1717000	1721000	It's actually- you use like the bottom center part of your screen.
1721000	1725000	And that is actually representative of your entire screen because it's where you're aiming your wand.
1725000	1728000	So just play around in the bottom part and you'll notice how your reticle goes around.
1728000	1732000	So you have to aim your reticle and hold it over a certain point because sometimes the monster moves.
1732000	1734000	So you have to kind of move your finger to go to the monster.
1734000	1738000	And then once it's connected for enough time, you draw a pattern with it that will come up on the screen.
1738000	1739000	It's very interactive.
1739000	1741000	Yeah, then you have to defend and all this stuff.
1741000	1746000	So the battling, I think, is far more interesting than- and I bet in AR it's really cool.
1746000	1751000	But the very first thing I did was turn off AR mode because I know what a battery sync that is.
1751000	1753000	So I turn off the AR stuff.
1753000	1757000	Number two, I think there's more meta games at the beginning of the game.
1757000	1762000	Remember when Pokémon Go, I mean, well, and then Pokémon Go, especially when it started, day one,
1762000	1765000	there wasn't a lot to do but catch Pokémon, which was fine.
1765000	1767000	I mean, everybody loves Pokémon, right?
1767000	1772000	But now in this, you have ingredient collecting, you have potion brewing, you have the greenhouse stuff.
1772000	1778000	You have- there's like a lot of other things to do that aren't necessarily even there in Pokémon Go yet.
1778000	1783000	Number three, there are more points of interest in Harry Potter Wizards Unite
1783000	1788000	because every Ingress portal crossed over into Harry Potter Wizards Unite.
1788000	1791000	So you're probably seeing things you didn't see in Pokémon Go and the reason why-
1791000	1793000	But the Starbucks didn't.
1793000	1794000	Oh, yeah, that's a good point.
1794000	1799000	The sponsored stuff from Pokémon Go didn't directly come over.
1799000	1802000	So your sprints and your Starbucks are not in Pokémon Go.
1802000	1810000	But for example, in Pokémon Go, where those gyms are, where there's like Starbucks near me,
1810000	1812000	there's actually a portal that got suppressed from Ingress.
1812000	1814000	So it's in Harry Potter.
1814000	1816000	So you see the portal is in Harry Potter instead.
1816000	1818000	So there are more points of interest.
1818000	1820000	But actually, since we're talking about sponsored locations,
1820000	1825000	I don't know what they did in Harry Potter, but there are a ton of sponsored locations.
1825000	1828000	They're all at malls.
1828000	1830000	Really? I haven't been to any malls yet.
1830000	1832000	Yes. I went to the Vacaville outlets.
1832000	1835000	I was in Berkeley, ironically, for an Ingress thing over the weekend.
1835000	1840000	And I stopped at the Vacaville outlets on the way home because my fat ass wanted jelly beans.
1840000	1844000	So I went to the outlet that was there and I wanted to look at clothes too.
1844000	1847000	So I stopped there and I brought up Harry Potter and I was like,
1847000	1850000	because I know in Ingress, I'm like, there's three portals here.
1850000	1852000	There's like that signboard and like two other things.
1852000	1856000	I bring up Harry Potter Wizards Unite and I'm like, what the hell?
1856000	1857000	There's like a ton of stuff here.
1857000	1863000	And I click on it and like one of them says near Taco Bell and it's sponsored.
1863000	1868000	And the picture is a signboard that in fact is near Taco Bell.
1868000	1870000	And there was other stuff like that too.
1870000	1874000	It was like Far East Starbucks was there.
1874000	1877000	So it's like the malls submitted all these locations.
1877000	1879000	I hear Arden Fair has a ton of stuff like that too.
1879000	1881000	So that's another one of our local malls.
1881000	1885000	So, yeah, I don't know. It's weird.
1885000	1889000	Like a ton of sponsored stuff crossed over.
1889000	1890000	So, yeah.
1890000	1895000	Number four, Prestiging is already built into the game.
1895000	1899000	So as somebody who's hit maximum level in Pokémon GO,
1899000	1903000	there's not a lot to do after that point except try to build the Pokédex
1903000	1906000	and collect shinies and I guess work on friendship levels.
1906000	1907000	I mean, this needs to do.
1907000	1909000	But as far as experience goes, that's really it.
1910000	1913000	Ingress put in a Prestiging.
1913000	1914000	They call it Recursing.
1914000	1917000	But they put in something where you can kind of go back and start over,
1917000	1919000	which I don't think they did a great job of it
1919000	1923000	because they were supposed to give us a power that they haven't given us yet for Recursing.
1923000	1924000	Oops, we forgot.
1924000	1928000	Well, I think it's because they're having to run the Redacted and Prime still.
1928000	1930000	But that's a whole other game and a set of issues.
1930000	1934000	But Harry Potter actually already has Prestiging built in, sort of.
1934000	1938000	Now the max level in Harry Potter Wizards Unite is 60, is what I'm hearing.
1938000	1942000	But you know how you're filling up those pages with stickers and stuff?
1942000	1944000	And you might be wondering, what happens when I fill up a page?
1944000	1951000	You can Prestige the page and start over and you'll get the XP bonuses reset
1951000	1953000	so you can collect XP bonuses again from the pages.
1953000	1959000	And my understanding is that the pages will have a permanent bronze, silver, or gold frame around them
1959000	1961000	depending on how many times you Prestiged it.
1961000	1964000	So there's a little more to do there.
1965000	1966000	And then, yeah.
1966000	1968000	I'm going to have cake.
1968000	1969000	You're going to have some cake. Go for it.
1969000	1970000	You earned cake. Get a cake.
1970000	1974000	Number five, the classes and the skill trees.
1974000	1980000	That's kind of unheard of in the Pokemon Go, is that you actually get to pick what class you want to be.
1980000	1981000	There's three classes.
1981000	1985000	There's the Aurora, something like that.
1985000	1987000	Auror, which is the DPS.
1987000	1990000	There's the Magizoologist.
1990000	1991000	Magizoologist.
1991000	1992000	Magizoologist.
1992000	1994000	Why would you go away and get cake when I need you, Darcyra?
1994000	1999000	The Magizoologist, which is, I guess, part tanky, part heal-y.
1999000	2001000	And then Professor, that's the easy one.
2001000	2004000	That's the one that I'm playing, which I think is like a support class type of thing.
2004000	2008000	And so apparently it actually matters when you go into some of these fortress battles.
2008000	2014000	You can play with other people and as a professor, I can actually put heals on somebody while they're battling somebody else.
2014000	2019000	And then you actually have a skill tree that you build out using pages that you collect from doing battles and things like that.
2019000	2020000	So it's kind of neat.
2020000	2026000	It's a lot more in-depth than we've seen from your typical Niantic game so far.
2026000	2028000	So, yeah.
2028000	2029000	There you go.
2029000	2035000	So those are five ways that Harry Potter Wizards Unite is different from Pokémon Go.
2035000	2043000	And that I am really not seeing in a lot of those articles that are out there because I bet those people played it for an hour and then went to go write their articles.
2043000	2045000	So, just saying.
2045000	2046000	Anyway.
2046000	2048000	And you kind of perked up at some of that stuff I was saying.
2048000	2050000	Did some of that make you maybe want to go check it out again?
2050000	2052000	Or nah, you're already over it.
2052000	2053000	We'll see.
2053000	2059000	Now, I'm not going to be like the game's biggest stand or the game's biggest offender.
2059000	2061000	I also have a list of four so far.
2061000	2062000	I couldn't think of them all.
2062000	2067000	But I have a list of four ways that this game needs to improve ASAP.
2067000	2069000	My four items for how this game needs to improve.
2069000	2073000	Number one, right now there's really no point to the friends list.
2073000	2078000	I see all these posts on Facebook and Twitter that are like, add me, add me, add me.
2078000	2081000	And right now there's really no reason to do it.
2081000	2085000	The professor battling, I understand, or I'm sorry, professor battling.
2085000	2092000	The tower battling may have something there where like having the people on your friends list is kind of helpful and some of that stuff.
2092000	2095000	But there's no gift sending.
2095000	2098000	Somebody joked that maybe they'll have owls that you can send out or something.
2098000	2100000	Maybe that'll be a thing later on.
2100000	2103000	But right now there's no gift sending.
2103000	2104000	There's nothing like that.
2104000	2110000	So there's no reason to have friends and there's especially no reason to have friends long distance.
2110000	2116000	So sorry I haven't given out my friend code on Twitter or anything like that.
2116000	2121000	But right now there's no reason to have friends that are far away in the game right now.
2121000	2123000	There's no reason to unite with these wizards.
2123000	2124000	No.
2124000	2126000	But hopefully there will be.
2126000	2130000	Bobby Blackwell says there is no reason to have friends.
2130000	2133000	I said it. Print it. Put it on the back of the box.
2133000	2134000	Isn't that what I just said?
2134000	2136000	Yeah. It is.
2136000	2139000	All right. Number two. Thank you.
2139000	2141000	I like how she just knows to give me red velvet.
2141000	2144000	Number two in the airing of Grievances.
2144000	2148000	Adventure Sync needs to be in this game like right now.
2148000	2154000	Because it's a battery drain to walk those little port keys around.
2154000	2156000	Which I didn't even talk about.
2156000	2159000	That's a sixth way that this is very different than Pokemon Go.
2159000	2162000	Those port keys, yeah they're kind of like eggs superficially.
2162000	2165000	Is that you put the key and you know you walk a certain distance.
2165000	2173000	But I would bet you any article that says port keys are the equivalent to eggs in Pokemon Go didn't hatch one.
2173000	2175000	They didn't walk two kilometers yet.
2175000	2176000	Because guess what?
2176000	2179000	They don't just hatch and poof you have a new picture.
2179000	2183000	No. You have to go in there and you do it and then you kind of end up in like a forced AR thing.
2183000	2185000	But like not necessarily in your own room.
2185000	2186000	Or VR. Not AR.
2186000	2188000	Yeah. I don't even know if I call it. Maybe.
2188000	2190000	Dark Sakura says more VR than AR. I guess.
2190000	2192000	AR is an augmented reality.
2192000	2194000	Okay. You need to say this on a mic Dark Sakura.
2194000	2195000	Come back.
2195000	2197000	Like I'm not going to relay everything.
2197000	2200000	So AR is augmented reality.
2200000	2203000	Where it is your real life area with augmenting to it.
2203000	2205000	VR is virtual reality.
2205000	2209000	So these little houses that you go to with your port key are virtual spaces.
2209000	2211000	So it is VR.
2211000	2213000	Okay. Put the knife down when you're talking to me though.
2213000	2214000	Just kidding.
2214000	2217000	Honestly it's a little bit of both because it does start AR.
2217000	2219000	You do see your own world and you tap on it.
2219000	2220000	It's a little mix of both.
2220000	2222000	That's really where I got to leave it at.
2222000	2226000	But you kind of go in this thing and you like have to look around using your phone as a way to look.
2226000	2228000	And you want to tap all these little lights.
2228000	2230000	It's like a Where's Waldo thing.
2230000	2232000	It's not just like a hatching thing.
2232000	2234000	So it's something that's different.
2234000	2237000	But like it's really ridiculous that you have to have your game open while you walk ten kilometers.
2237000	2239000	Like that's not going to happen.
2240000	2242000	And the thing while you're driving.
2242000	2244000	You know the slow driving under 20 miles an hour.
2244000	2246000	That doesn't work anymore either.
2246000	2248000	I was going ten and it knew.
2248000	2250000	What if I was on my bike?
2250000	2252000	But your character does fly a broom which I think is really cute.
2252000	2255000	Bobby Blackwell says Microsoft's term is mixed reality.
2255000	2257000	I think that's a good way to put it.
2257000	2259000	Mixed reality.
2259000	2261000	All right.
2261000	2264000	Why No Record in chat says it takes some real restraint to actually slice those little cakes.
2264000	2266000	I just grab a fork.
2266000	2269000	Dark soccer wants to make sure everybody gets a piece of what they want.
2269000	2273000	I also wanted to make sure that if people wanted to try the other cakes.
2273000	2274000	Yeah.
2274000	2275000	That there's a little bit you can have a small piece of it.
2275000	2276000	That's good. I like that.
2276000	2277000	Carrot cake is my favorite.
2277000	2279000	All right.
2279000	2281000	Let's see. Number three.
2281000	2283000	My third grievance out of four.
2283000	2286000	The greenhouse mechanic is too weird and it's broken.
2286000	2290000	You go in there and you can plant a seed and water it.
2290000	2293000	And then other people can come by and improve it.
2293000	2297000	Like you go to a greenhouse, you plant something is like this is going to hatch in seven hours.
2297000	2300000	Great. I'm not going to hang out here for seven hours and wait for it to hatch.
2300000	2303000	So unless you like live by one.
2303000	2310000	Work has a greenhouse and it had my same plant from the one I planted by my house.
2310000	2311000	Interesting.
2311000	2313000	So I don't think it carries over like that. I think that's just luck.
2313000	2315000	I think that's a coincidence.
2315000	2318000	No, no, no, no. It was the plant had the same timer and everything.
2318000	2322000	So I think it remembers that you planted one at a greenhouse and it doesn't matter which one you go to.
2322000	2327000	Interesting. OK, if that's true, then I would like them to be able to explain that because I was not getting that impression at all.
2327000	2332000	But I've been walking around as I've been playing Ingress for the double AP, getting a lot of like stops and greenhouses.
2332000	2335000	So I probably didn't get that, I guess. Anyway.
2335000	2338000	So, yeah, I think they just need to refine it.
2338000	2345000	I think if it does really work the way Darksire is describing, I guess it's a little better that it would move to you wherever greenhouse you're at.
2345000	2348000	But like, I'm not going to not everybody lives on a greenhouse.
2348000	2351000	I see a lot of you like, oh, the closest thing you're me is on a greenhouse.
2351000	2355000	That's great. But you have to realize these games get a lot of shit in rural areas as it is.
2355000	2358000	So they need to do something a little better, I think, with that.
2358000	2365000	I actually the little park by my neighbor has has neighborhood has one of each seven in a greenhouse and a tower.
2365000	2371000	If you go I don't want to say where I live, but if you go down to the park, not the one right here, but the other one that's bigger, that's further down.
2371000	2376000	There's like five in two fortresses. There's like tons of stuff.
2376000	2382000	So anyway, lastly, number four, there is way not enough space to store stuff.
2382000	2385000	Yes, I need more indication what to keep in toss.
2385000	2388000	And they're using it as a way to sell extra space. And it's not there.
2388000	2391000	They're really gouging you for that. What is this? No man's sky.
2391000	2393000	It's silly. Early No Man's Sky.
2393000	2400000	Now, I suppose a fifth thing I could be critical about is the spell energy, but I will give Niantic and the team Portkey and all that.
2400000	2404000	I will give them props because they address the spell energy thing already.
2404000	2409000	They said, OK, we hear you guys on the spell energy thing. So you're going to start with more spell energy.
2409000	2412000	There's a gift right now in the store for 50 free spell energy.
2412000	2416000	If you haven't got that yet, go to the store and scroll down to the bottom.
2416000	2420000	It's there. You get 50 free spell energy right now. We're going to make ends give more energy.
2420000	2426000	All greenhouses will give energy. So like they've already like tried to address it. Is it perfect?
2426000	2430000	No. But am I really encouraged that it took 48 hours for them to address it?
2430000	2438000	Yes, because that's not the Niantic I know. So I don't know if Portkey's doing the management on that or what, but that's pretty outstanding.
2438000	2443000	So, yeah. So I know I talked a lot in depth about that, but I think there's a lot with this game.
2443000	2446000	And it is kind of the biggest thing in gaming this week since E3 is over.
2446000	2450000	So, yeah. Anything else you guys want to say on Harry Potter, Wizards Unite?
2450000	2453000	I'm just really enjoying the simplicity of it.
2453000	2461000	Yeah. I mean, I suppose it could motivate me to get back out and walk, but it's 100 degrees. So no.
2461000	2467000	Yeah. It's hard to juggle the different games because one of my Ingress pals is like, so you're going to play three games now?
2467000	2475000	And I'm like, honestly, Pokemon goes on the back burner until I have reason to play it like community days or things like that.
2475000	2481000	I was already, which I need to get shinies from you anyway, but I was already playing Pokemon Go.
2481000	2487000	I was playing idle pouring. I still play idle pouring. I'm playing Animal Crossing Pocket Camp.
2487000	2492000	And now I'm playing this. It was some Ingress thrown in for, you know, lulz.
2492000	2499000	Yeah. SG100Matt in our chat at Twitch TV slash VOG Network says the amount of data it uses is keeping me from playing it on Wi-Fi for now.
2499000	2503000	Niantic knows that it uses a bunch of data, but I'm sure it'll get better after updates.
2503000	2510000	Well, they have, there's like guides online on how to save the data. You can turn off downloading over wireless networks.
2510000	2516000	And then you can actually set an option to download all the content to save on some of that.
2516000	2520000	Yeah, I actually did that, even though that's going to eat up like three and a half gigs on your phone.
2520000	2527000	I downloaded all the content and, but I also, I am fortunate where I have unlimited internet on my cell phone.
2527000	2531000	And these AR games are a big reason why. So it's not a concern for me.
2531000	2535000	However, your concern is completely valid because I know there are a lot of people on metered plans.
2535000	2542000	And so Niantic kind of needs to be reasonable about that if they want people to play that game a lot.
2542000	2549000	So figure out how to fucking build your mobile game plans. Cause it's like, it's ridiculous that my phone should be set on fire and crash half the time.
2549000	2556000	Like, like this right here, this I'm sure is, oh, there it goes. It was like glitching the hell out. It already crashed once.
2556000	2557000	Yeah. Wow.
2558000	2563000	Mine got really hot. I was going to do a break segment tonight to talk about Wizards Unite.
2563000	2567000	But when I tried to go out in the sun and walk and record, my phone was like, nope, not doing it.
2567000	2575000	It was like getting so jittery slow, like the frame rate. And I have an iPhone 10. Like I don't, you know, it's not exactly an old phone.
2575000	2578000	So yeah, there you go.
2578000	2583000	YYR in chat says, wait, you have a bandwidth cap on your house internet, but none on your mobile phone?
2583000	2592000	Correct. I have a bandwidth cap from Comcast on my house internet, one terabyte, but not on my mobile phone from AT&T Unlimited, whatever.
2592000	2596000	Cause all the carriers got in an unlimited war not that long ago.
2596000	2599000	Cause they just throttle your service once you get so many.
2599000	2604000	The cable companies ought to just go into the unlimited space. I'm sure we'd all love that.
2604000	2611000	I, this gets off topic a lot, but I think a big reason the cable companies kind of did the data limits to begin with was piracy.
2611000	2614000	I think piracy was a huge reason they did this in the first place.
2614000	2621000	But now that we're getting in this, I think there's a lot less piracy than there used to be.
2621000	2623000	I'm not saying it's not there. I'm not naive.
2623000	2629000	But I think there's a lot less than there used to be because of things like Spotify, Apple Music, etc.
2629000	2634000	Less people use things like Napster or downloading MP3s and those types of archives.
2634000	2637000	And YouTube, you can listen to a lot of music on there.
2637000	2642000	And then when it comes to TV shows, now because of Netflix and Hulu and that stuff, less people download them.
2642000	2647000	Again, I'm not naive. Yes, people do download things like Game of Thrones and stuff because people get sick of the whole,
2647000	2650000	I'm not going to pay $10 for this, $10 for that, $10 for this.
2650000	2659000	So, but I would say that people are probably legitimizing some of it and maybe pirating the rest that isn't on their preferred service.
2659000	2663000	But anyway, I'm getting into a digression a little bit there.
2663000	2670000	But, yeah. So anyway, Act Def says, even then you may have unlimited, but you don't have unthrottled internet.
2670000	2675000	I got to admit, I've not really had a problem. If they throttle me, I don't really notice.
2675000	2680000	So, because I'm not doing anything that big on data. I'm just playing stupid games.
2680000	2682000	I'm not trying to download big things very often.
2682000	2685000	And I have the rollover data, so I never run out.
2685000	2687000	Yeah. Oh, that's nice. That's really nice.
2687000	2690000	All right. So anyway, that's plenty on Harry Potter Wizards Unite.
2690000	2694000	I know we talked at length about that, but again, it is kind of the big thing going on in gaming this week.
2694000	2699000	Let's talk about our gaming week outside of that. What other types of things have we been doing this week?
2699000	2702000	So, Dark Soccer, how was your gaming week outside of Harry Potter?
2702000	2704000	Bloodstained.
2704000	2709000	Oh, yeah. I haven't gotten to play it yet because my Kickstarter code is on the Switch.
2709000	2713000	So, I have to wait another week. So, please tell me all about it.
2713000	2718000	Oh, my God. It's great. It is beautiful. The music is beautiful.
2718000	2722000	The game is great. Even the voice acting, because Dan's playing it in English.
2722000	2726000	The voice acting is good. The scenery is amazing.
2726000	2730000	I'm really hoping that Boundary Break, one of the channels I watch on YouTube,
2730000	2733000	does a behind the scenes Boundary Break stuff.
2733000	2736000	You know, show what's behind those background scenes.
2736000	2741000	It feels like Symphony of the Night. It really does.
2741000	2744000	It seems a little bit harder, though.
2745000	2750000	But the controls are pretty responsive.
2750000	2755000	You get twists and turns in some of the characters.
2755000	2760000	The little universe that was built up for it is pretty damn good.
2760000	2765000	I mean, it's good when you can go into a game and it already has lore behind it.
2765000	2768000	And then voice actors.
2768000	2773000	Zangetsu is voiced by David Hayter.
2773000	2777000	So, we've been making solid snake jokes, of course.
2777000	2783000	And then there's a character by the name of O.D., who's a librarian.
2783000	2788000	It's Alucard's voice actor.
2788000	2792000	So, we've been calling him Alucard the whole time.
2792000	2796000	And then there's even some of the nods to Symphony.
2796000	2801000	Like, you can sit in the chairs and your fairy familiar will sit on you.
2801000	2806000	You can get Shovel Knight as a shard power.
2806000	2809000	You can get Shovel Knight's armor and turn into Shovel Knight.
2809000	2813000	And it is Shovel Knight licensed.
2813000	2816000	You can...
2816000	2819000	I'm just trying to think of some of the other little neat things.
2819000	2821000	You've got your bell tower you can jump through.
2821000	2824000	You've got clock towers. You've got train rides.
2824000	2827000	You've got just all kinds of amazing things.
2827000	2829000	And it really is perfect.
2829000	2831000	And there's a scene that I put up on my Facebook.
2831000	2834000	I was just about to ask this. What was that thing with the piano that you had on Facebook?
2834000	2839000	So, there's a garden that you can go into that just has a piano sitting under a canopy.
2839000	2845000	And if you do it without the fairy familiar, then you just play the song.
2845000	2848000	But if the fairy familiar is with you, she'll sing it.
2848000	2851000	And that's pretty cool.
2851000	2854000	I'm just trying to think of some other neat things in there too.
2854000	2856000	You can...
2856000	2862000	One thing that actually just me being an art nerd, they talk about photography.
2862000	2864000	And like, what's a photograph?
2864000	2868000	And so one of the characters explains how daguerreotypes work.
2868000	2872000	And it's absolutely, absolutely amazing.
2872000	2874000	Oh, and one other thing is like when you, you know,
2874000	2877000	eventually when you get a certain power,
2877000	2881000	you can do the thing where you can knock OD's chair into the air,
2881000	2883000	like you could with the shopkeeper.
2883000	2885000	And just keep bouncing it up and down and up and down.
2885000	2888000	And he gives you stuff just like the shopkeeper did.
2888000	2892000	So, some of the powers are really, really crazy.
2892000	2896000	And I don't want to spoil it because Dan and I were doing blind plays through it.
2896000	2899000	Yeah, don't ruin it for me because I want to experience it next week.
2899000	2906000	But eventually though, you need to think outside of your present box.
2906000	2911000	But it really just kind of takes you on some twists.
2911000	2913000	There's hidden stuff in places.
2913000	2916000	Just explore everything. Take the ferry with you.
2916000	2917000	Awesome.
2917000	2920000	So I'm excited to try it myself.
2920000	2923000	So you give it your seal of approval because I know a lot of people were worried about it.
2923000	2926000	Like some of the early versions that came out kind of didn't run good.
2926000	2930000	Oh, I didn't see any issues.
2930000	2933000	I mean, some of the bosses are fucking hard as balls.
2933000	2935000	I mean, and we're at the end of the game.
2935000	2936000	Oh, wow.
2936000	2938000	Lots of hidden stuff though.
2938000	2943000	Lots of hidden areas to find filling in your map.
2943000	2946000	You know, it's got all the great stuff that Symphony of the Night did.
2946000	2949000	And on top of that, it's charming in its own right.
2949000	2951000	Not just because of nostalgia.
2951000	2956000	If Symphony of the Night had never existed and this just came out, this would be what Symphony of the Night was.
2956000	2957000	Does that make sense?
2957000	2958000	Yeah, no, I do.
2958000	2960000	In terms of the love behind it and popularity.
2960000	2963000	It doesn't need a Castlevania name behind it.
2963000	2965000	It is standalone.
2965000	2966000	Great.
2966000	2969000	And then, of course, my usual other games on my phone.
2969000	2970000	All right.
2970000	2972000	Oh, and we just got a new pinball.
2972000	2973000	Oh, you got a new pinball?
2973000	2976000	You know what I've been wanting for a long fucking time?
2976000	2978000	There's a lot. Big Bang Bar.
2978000	2979000	Fuck.
2979000	2981000	We have a Black Rose.
2981000	2982000	Oh, okay.
2982000	2986000	So now we have like three done by the same guys.
2986000	2989000	So we're like, who are we gonna sell one?
2989000	2992000	And Dan's like, I'm not getting rid of my creature from the Black Lagoon.
2992000	2993000	I'm like, damn.
2993000	2996000	But he's like, do you want to lend out World Cup soccer to a friend of mine?
2996000	2997000	No.
2997000	2998000	Why not?
2998000	2999000	Because I said no.
2999000	3000000	It was literally that.
3000000	3002000	Well, that's not a reason.
3002000	3003000	Yeah, no is a reason.
3003000	3005000	No, because I don't want to is a reason.
3005000	3009000	So now we have to find a place to put Black Rose.
3009000	3010000	All right.
3010000	3014000	He can lend out Shadow or something else or Indiana Jones.
3014000	3016000	Yeah, we got an Indiana Jones as well.
3016000	3017000	Oh, my gosh.
3017000	3018000	It's ever changing at your place.
3018000	3020000	Your place is an arcade.
3020000	3021000	It's great.
3021000	3022000	So that's it.
3022000	3023000	All right.
3023000	3024000	Let's go to Loki.
3024000	3025000	How was your gaming week, Loki?
3025000	3026000	I didn't play very much this week.
3026000	3029000	It's been stressful, but I did play just mobile stuff.
3029000	3031000	So a little bit of Pokemon Go.
3031000	3036000	I did open up Ingress because I was checking to see if the portal that I submitted actually
3036000	3037000	got accepted.
3037000	3043000	Ironically enough, not the location I wanted submitted, but the yogurt place next door.
3043000	3048000	There's a mural on the wall of yogurt, frozen yogurt, and that got accepted as a portal.
3048000	3050000	So but it hasn't been rejected yet, so there's still a chance.
3050000	3053000	But it is awfully close to where that would be.
3053000	3056000	So I'm skeptical that they're going to accept it.
3056000	3061000	I just had my first submission in Prime go through because you can submit in Prime now.
3061000	3064000	And when you submit in Prime, you can do two pictures.
3064000	3067000	You can put justification, which you can't do in the original.
3067000	3069000	So it helps it in getting through OPR.
3069000	3071000	So I had my first one get accepted, but it only took a week.
3071000	3076000	But it was like a really obviously it was an amphitheater at a park that somehow was not a portal.
3076000	3078000	So it was a very obvious yes candidate.
3078000	3080000	I doubt anybody voted no.
3080000	3081000	It's fine.
3081000	3082000	It could take a while.
3082000	3084000	So there's that.
3084000	3086000	And then what else?
3086000	3088000	I just worked a little bit on programming.
3088000	3091000	And yeah, that's about it.
3091000	3093000	Not too much.
3093000	3094000	All right.
3094000	3095000	My gaming week.
3095000	3097000	A lot of the similar types of stuff.
3097000	3098000	Things like Diablo 3.
3098000	3099000	Still cutting away at that.
3099000	3102000	And then Final Fantasy XIV gearing up for the expansion.
3102000	3105000	I did play more of the Castlevania collection this week.
3105000	3108000	And I did something I have never done before.
3108000	3110000	And I'm very excited about it.
3110000	3113000	Well, I beat Castlevania 1, which I've never done before.
3113000	3115000	Well, before you give me those kudos, Dark Soccer.
3115000	3121000	The reason why is because they actually patched the Castlevania collection this week with the Japanese versions of the game.
3121000	3128000	So instead of the Famicom disk version replacing Castlevania 1, they took the cartridge from 1993.
3128000	3133000	Because they released on cartridge when they added easy mode.
3133000	3135000	And I beat it with easy mode.
3135000	3139000	So not quite maybe deserving of all those kudos.
3139000	3142000	But hey, I got to see that ending I've never seen.
3142000	3144000	Does it play with the disk music, though?
3144000	3145000	Unfortunately, no.
3145000	3146000	Because it's cartridge.
3146000	3147000	Because the disk music was good.
3147000	3152000	Yeah, but what is really cool about Castlevania, the fact that they added the Japanese stuff,
3152000	3156000	is that Castlevania 3 does use the disk version.
3156000	3158000	And you get the disk music.
3158000	3163000	And I got to tell you, if you have Castlevania collection, go play Castlevania 3.
3163000	3175000	And that is probably the best game that shows you how having an additional sound channel on the Famicom disk system really elevated the 8-bit songs.
3175000	3176000	So yeah, check that out.
3176000	3178000	That's really all I have to say with that.
3178000	3179000	So.
3179000	3182000	Tigerclaw on chat says, Rob beat Castlevania 1.
3182000	3185000	Did he use any of those speedrunning strats to beat the levels?
3185000	3187000	No, I didn't.
3187000	3189000	It felt like some of them I was going through pretty quick.
3189000	3191000	But again, I was on easy mode.
3191000	3195000	And actually, I remember in one part, I tried to do the thing I remember in the second level.
3195000	3201000	You can like jump and get hit by a Medusa head and it knocks you up on the platform.
3201000	3203000	So you can actually skip this whole section.
3203000	3205000	But like, it wouldn't work.
3205000	3210000	And I don't know if I think they might have eliminated the knockback in easy mode, I think is why.
3210000	3212000	So it didn't work.
3212000	3216000	Because I remember like, I was thinking, weren't these mobs supposed to do a knockback and none of them were doing it.
3216000	3220000	So you keep the doubles and triples that you get.
3220000	3222000	You don't lose them when you change your weapon.
3222000	3224000	And you lose way less health.
3224000	3227000	So it makes it like, it makes it so much easier to get through the game.
3227000	3229000	So, yeah.
3229000	3231000	Let's see.
3231000	3236000	Bob Coffee in chat says, Japanese Castlevania 3 also has a lot more reasonable difficulty.
3236000	3240000	American version is way, way harder, way harsher damage.
3240000	3241000	So.
3241000	3245000	And Orange Wright's confirming what I thought where Castlevania easy mode didn't seem to have the knockback.
3245000	3250000	So anyway, if you have the Castlevania collection, just a heads up, it got patched with that Japanese patch.
3250000	3253000	And I think I heard the Arcade Collection got it too.
3253000	3256000	And I would imagine Contra Collection must have it.
3256000	3258000	If not, it's getting it real soon, I'm sure.
3258000	3260000	So, there is that.
3260000	3261000	Okay.
3261000	3263000	And that was my gaming week.
3263000	3266000	So, let's move on. We're going to get into some gaming news.
3266000	3268000	There's been a little bit going on throughout the gaming world.
3268000	3274000	Even if E3 was last week and we got all the big headlines then, we have a few things to talk about tonight.
3274000	3282000	So, this is the week in history in which EA decided to try to redefine definitions of what a loot box is.
3282000	3284000	And it's just ridiculous.
3284000	3290000	So, there was this whole UK Parliament's Digital Culture, Media and Sports Committee.
3290000	3301000	Where Carrie Hopkins of EA had made some statements when they were asking them whether they considered loot boxes to be an ethical feature.
3301000	3305000	And she stated, we don't call them loot boxes.
3305000	3311000	Instead, EA refers to them as surprise mechanics.
3311000	3313000	It's like, you know, a blind...
3313000	3315000	Surprise! Got your wallet.
3315000	3324000	Well, they're saying it's like a blind bags toy thing that you would get in the store where you don't know which toy you're going to get.
3324000	3327000	Sorry, that doesn't really cut it.
3327000	3329000	There's a major difference between those.
3329000	3339000	One, loot boxes are digital purchases which the value of what's inside them can greatly differ from what you're getting.
3339000	3349000	And it's not like where, especially with a lot of the EA games, like sports games and stuff, where there's a new game every year that stuff doesn't carry over.
3349000	3351000	So, you're basically getting it for a year.
3351000	3357000	Whereas, like if I bought a blind bag toy, like say for example, we tend to buy some of these Lego minifigure blind bags.
3357000	3361000	Yeah, you don't know what you're going to get in there, but it's always a Lego minifigure.
3361000	3366000	So, you're always getting something and that minifigure is not going to disappear in a year.
3366000	3369000	Well, I can think of the biggest difference is that...
3369000	3374000	Okay, so what about when I used to buy Magic the Gathering cards, which I'm sure some of you still do.
3374000	3377000	You might get something of a very high, great value in there.
3377000	3381000	And you know generally you're going to get so many land cards, but you might get something really good in there, right?
3381000	3384000	But here's the big, big difference between Magic the Gathering cards and loot boxes.
3384000	3388000	If I get cards I don't necessarily want, I can trade them and give them to somebody else.
3388000	3393000	I can trade. I can, you know, it's kind of like a currency I can use and trade with other people.
3393000	3396000	And that was the whole point of a trading card game.
3396000	3399000	But you can't really, and it's just like your blind boxes.
3399000	3402000	If you don't get what you want, you trade with somebody else to get the one you want.
3402000	3403000	Exactly.
3403000	3404000	You can't do that in loot box games.
3404000	3408000	And you can't just call it something else and say,
3409000	3413000	See? We're not illegal. Like, you know, I didn't murder that person.
3413000	3417000	I just... ate it in his early death.
3417000	3421000	You know, it's like, you can't just call it something else and say,
3421000	3424000	See? Can't get us now. They're not loot boxes.
3424000	3428000	And ironically enough, you know, was it, not even a week or so ago,
3428000	3431000	when they have the whole Star Wars thing and they're talking about their brand new Star Wars.
3431000	3433000	It's not going to have loot boxes in it.
3433000	3435000	So does that mean there are going to be loot boxes in it?
3435000	3437000	Because you're not calling them loot boxes anymore.
3437000	3439000	It's going to have surprise. Surprise!
3439000	3440000	You're getting fucked again.
3440000	3444000	Surprise! It's a mechanic in which we're going to demand money from you.
3444000	3446000	I didn't murder them, Loki.
3446000	3449000	I put surprise poison in their drink.
3450000	3453000	But it wasn't murder. It was a surprise.
3453000	3454000	Right?
3456000	3460000	Their body got riddled with surprise projectiles.
3461000	3463000	It's stupid. It's stupid.
3463000	3468000	It's stupid and it's funny is, like, even the people at, you know, that hearing.
3469000	3470000	They fucking saw right through it.
3470000	3473000	And it's just like, I don't know what they thought that they were going to do.
3473000	3475000	Like, pull one over on them.
3475000	3477000	Like, all of a sudden they're going to be like,
3477000	3479000	You know, we never thought about it like that.
3479000	3482000	I guess this is completely legal. Bye bye.
3482000	3484000	I mean, like, what the fuck did you think was going to happen?
3485000	3488000	The other thing with those, I was going to say on those, like, Happy Meal toys and stuff,
3488000	3490000	where you don't know, like, which toy you're going to get.
3490000	3495000	Like, actually, if you're just really nice to the employees and say please and thank you
3495000	3499000	and act like a nice person and not like, you know, an asshole at customer service and all that,
3499000	3501000	like, usually you can just ask really nicely,
3501000	3505000	Is there any way you could get one with the, you know, bunny beanie baby or whatever?
3505000	3507000	Because that's the one my kid doesn't have.
3507000	3510000	And they'll do it, like, if they can.
3510000	3513000	I guess back in the day, maybe I'm thinking a long time ago
3513000	3515000	when I had a bunch of friends that worked at McDonald's.
3515000	3517000	Like, they would, like, if I wanted something, I would get it.
3517000	3519000	They would get it for me, you know?
3519000	3523000	But, like, I don't know, maybe today they're harder to do that stuff with.
3523000	3526000	To be fair, like, a lot of times they can pull strings, you know?
3526000	3530000	To be fair, in this case with EA's stuff, on some of the Ultimate Steam stuff,
3530000	3533000	you can actually trade those cards that you get in there,
3533000	3543000	but they do, like, I mean, there's, they have patents for, like, predatory, like, schemes
3543000	3549000	to basically try to lure you into, you know, making more purchases.
3549000	3553000	They've got, like, Activision has some of these stuff that they've patented.
3553000	3556000	They have whole, like, firms that are dedicated to this stuff.
3556000	3560000	You can't tell me, and the fact, also, there's people that have said, like,
3560000	3566000	listen, I've dropped, like, $20,000 because I just can't stop buying these things.
3566000	3570000	I'm addicted to it, like, you know, gambling, and they're just ignoring all that stuff.
3570000	3572000	And, like, I get it.
3572000	3573000	Yay, capitalism.
3573000	3577000	It's, but here's the thing, it's never gonna end until people stop buying them,
3577000	3583000	and that's the problem. You're never gonna have that happen if people keep, you know, putting money into it.
3583000	3585000	So, stop it, people.
3585000	3587000	Do you have another comment on this, StarSucker?
3587000	3588000	No, just yay capitalism.
3588000	3590000	Oh, yeah, well, that's part of it.
3590000	3592000	Let's see, YYR in chat says,
3592000	3597000	BRB gonna politely ask my Gotcha mobile game for that five-star legendary I've been trying to pull.
3598000	3602000	Questbuster says, they can be done right, but when the focus is on companies that make them pretty terrible,
3602000	3604000	they just paint everything with that brush.
3604000	3608000	And Act F says, I don't mind loot boxes if done correctly and not shoved down,
3608000	3612000	and especially if the loot boxes have accessories that have items that can help you win a game.
3612000	3617000	Well, you don't necessarily want something that's, like, you're gonna, like, you need it to beat the game.
3617000	3621000	Or I think another example of, like, how this went really wrong was when they put, like,
3621000	3626000	and correct me if I'm wrong, but, like, Darth Vader was in a loot box in Star Wars, right?
3626000	3628000	And they also had pay-to-win stuff that was in there.
3628000	3631000	Yeah, and that's kind of, especially when you're showing that shit in the trailer, that's shady, you know?
3631000	3633000	So, that's all I think.
3633000	3635000	But it's EA, and they knew the fuck they were doing.
3635000	3640000	But, and didn't we talk, I said, like, if you want to put a pink Darth Vader costume in a loot box,
3640000	3642000	that would be much different, and awesome, actually.
3642000	3644000	And they said no one wanted that.
3645000	3649000	But, yes, no, I understand that EA said that, because it would break canon.
3649000	3650000	Well...
3650000	3656000	But then, at the same time, you know, we have, like, all these different heroes from different timelines
3656000	3662000	in the Star Wars universe running around together, and, you know, that doesn't break canon.
3663000	3667000	Yeah, no, I don't, it's silly, it's ridiculous.
3667000	3672000	And we're still recording for our podcast, but for some reason our Twitch dropped live,
3672000	3675000	and I noticed our internet just went, like, boo, like, it just cut out.
3675000	3679000	But I think it's a hiccup. I think we're back up and running now, the joys of live internet.
3679000	3683000	But I saw, when people started complaining in chat, people was like,
3683000	3687000	EA's killed the stream for them talking too much, I can see people in chat,
3687000	3691000	and then I looked over in the little box on OBS, it's like, orange, red.
3691000	3693000	And so, yeah, we just had a little hiccup.
3693000	3697000	Little, little hiccup in the server, going to Twitch, that's weird.
3697000	3701000	But, like, I stayed in chat, and everything else was working, so I don't think it was our internet.
3701000	3703000	Oh well, things happen.
3703000	3707000	Sorry, guys, we do our very best, but there's gonna just be things that are out of our control.
3707000	3709000	You're right, EA might be trying to pull the plug.
3709000	3715000	That's right, Act F, it was not an internet outage, it was a surprise hiccup.
3715000	3718000	That was Act F's words.
3718000	3719000	Surprise break.
3719000	3721000	A surprise hiccup.
3721000	3725000	Okay, that was just a feature of our show, alright.
3725000	3727000	That's why you all show up live.
3727000	3729000	Alright, let's move on.
3729000	3733000	So we've talked a lot about Niantic already, but, you know,
3733000	3737000	they're stepping up to be a major, major game maker in this industry.
3737000	3741000	And they've made another big move this week, they bought another company.
3741000	3746000	They've bought a few, because they bought, like, a profile making company or something a while ago, I remember that.
3746000	3754000	But we haven't seen what they've done with that, really, yet, unless some of that technology went into those, like, very elaborate avatars in Harry Potter, maybe, I don't know.
3754000	3756000	What, elaborate avatars?
3756000	3761000	If you go into your little cart, those, like, Snapchat filters that she said she liked, you put, like, wigs on your character and stuff, but it's...
3761000	3762000	Not that elaborate.
3762000	3764000	It's about as, well, it's silly.
3764000	3767000	It's more elaborate than Pokemon Go, that's for sure.
3767000	3773000	But anyway, Niantic also has purchased a company called Sensible Object.
3773000	3781000	Sensible Object is based out of London, and they are probably best known for making combination digital and tabletop games.
3781000	3792000	Their first game was called Beasts of Balance, where you go into a fantasy world and you have physical stackable creations, but you, they translate into digital points scoring.
3792000	3796000	It kind of, I don't know why, but I'm reminded of, like, DropMix, right?
3796000	3800000	Which is, like, the card game by Harmonix, but you use a phone app to play all the music.
3800000	3802000	It's kind of like, and that game is really cool, if you've never played it.
3802000	3807000	Like, even if you don't really care for music games, just to kind of see that technology in motion is, like, really awesome.
3808000	3809000	So, yeah.
3809000	3813000	So, we don't know why Niantic has purchased this.
3813000	3818000	A lot of folks wondering, is it related to Harry Potter or Pokemon?
3818000	3821000	Maybe there'll be little physical Pokemon that do something.
3821000	3822000	Could it be related?
3822000	3830000	I've seen a thought that maybe Ingress, how Ingress has an anime, maybe there's going to be a board game at some point of Ingress that might tie in.
3830000	3833000	Who knows, but I think it's a given.
3833000	3839000	You know, if Harry Potter's made as much money as it did out the gate, Pokemon Go is still continuing to rake in the money.
3839000	3842000	Ingress is cute.
3842000	3844000	Ingress has a passionate community.
3844000	3846000	You know what? I'll say that from first hand.
3846000	3851000	Ingress has a, I didn't talk about it in my gaming week, but I went to Berkeley to do this thing called Mission Day in Ingress.
3851000	3855000	And it was still, like, it wasn't a huge crowd, but it was 150 people that turned out to do different missions.
3855000	3856000	So, quite a bit.
3856000	3857000	Yeah.
3857000	3858000	So, it has a passionate community.
3858000	3859000	We'll say that.
3859000	3862000	So, I'm sure Niantic's not stopping there.
3862000	3864000	And they know what their next game's going to be.
3864000	3866000	We just don't know what it is yet.
3866000	3869000	And will it be on an existing IP already?
3869000	3870000	Who knows?
3870000	3873000	That should be, we haven't done listless in a long time in this show.
3873000	3875000	That should be something we do in the future.
3875000	3879000	What IP should Niantic make an AR game out of next?
3879000	3881000	I think that would be a fun one.
3881000	3883000	That would be pretty fun.
3883000	3884000	Yeah.
3884000	3885000	But anyway, yeah.
3885000	3888000	What do you think about, like, board game meets mobile game type of thing?
3888000	3890000	Eye of Judgment?
3890000	3894000	Yeah, you can't help but think of the Eye of Judgment on PS3.
3894000	3895000	You're right, you're right.
3895000	3897000	But that's more AR gaming.
3897000	3899000	That's not necessarily a board game.
3899000	3901000	Well, their hybrids are AR games.
3901000	3903000	Yeah, that's what Niantic does is AR games, though.
3903000	3905000	So, yeah.
3905000	3912000	I think, though, if you did a collectible card game that had that AR component,
3912000	3914000	then that would be pretty fun.
3914000	3917000	Because then you could change your cards, you know, like you were talking about before with the loot box thing.
3918000	3921000	You know, have your cards that you can trade around and build your decks.
3921000	3923000	Well, they did magic that way.
3923000	3928000	That would be cool to have, like, the battle happen while you're playing the game
3928000	3933000	and not have to sit in front of your computer and, you know, play something that's, you know, 70 years old.
3933000	3939000	So maybe, I mean, honestly, you're not describing something that's that terribly different from Eye of Judgment.
3939000	3943000	But with Eye of Judgment, you had to have this PlayStation 3, you had to have your camera and all this setup.
3943000	3945000	Now maybe you just have to have your mobile phone.
3945000	3946000	See, that's how it should be.
3946000	3947000	Yeah.
3947000	3950000	And even better if you've got, like, one of the VR kits for it.
3952000	3953000	Something like that.
3953000	3958000	Is the gag of 17 years of this show going to be that Eye of Judgment was merely ahead of its time?
3959000	3962000	Kind of it was, though. I mean...
3962000	3965000	Oh my god. I'm gonna cry.
3966000	3967000	You're matching your shirt now.
3967000	3971000	I feel like we've just had this big, like, explosion here on the show.
3971000	3975000	Is that for our 17th birthday, we finally just come to this realization.
3975000	3977000	Eye of Judgment was just ahead of its time.
3978000	3981000	I kind of think that it was. I mean, we made a lot of fun of it.
3981000	3988000	But maybe it's just because, you know, VR and AR were not big things then?
3988000	3990000	Well, and the name was really bad.
3990000	3991000	Okay.
3991000	3992000	The Brown Eye of Judgment?
3992000	3994000	The Brown Eye of Judgment. I still remember that.
3994000	3995000	Hold up here, okay?
3995000	3999000	It was not ahead of its time. It was a fucking dumb idea, is why.
3999000	4001000	And I'll tell you why it was a dumb idea.
4001000	4004000	Because it added fucking nothing to the game.
4004000	4008000	All it did was animate the stupid cards that you put down on the board.
4008000	4011000	That's it. You were still playing a card game,
4011000	4013000	just like you would play, like, Magic the Gathering,
4013000	4015000	except it just animated some stupid shit.
4015000	4017000	But then you had to set up your stupid camera
4017000	4020000	and have it hooked up to a PlayStation and a TV to view...
4020000	4022000	Ooh, it's a battle happening.
4022000	4025000	Whereas if you did it with your phone, your phone would move around.
4025000	4030000	But it's... they already have it. It's not engaging enough, you know, as it...
4030000	4032000	It wasn't engaging enough as a standalone game.
4032000	4035000	It's not gonna be engaging with this stupid shit that you have to tie to it.
4035000	4041000	So, no, it was a crappy game. It's not ahead of its time. It was garbage.
4041000	4044000	Well, I just got told. I don't know.
4044000	4046000	I... I'm... I...
4046000	4049000	There are elements of it that were maybe...
4049000	4052000	They had two chances to bring that stupid game out.
4052000	4056000	And it couldn't sell a million copies combined. So, too bad.
4058000	4059000	Get over it. It'll never happen.
4059000	4061000	All I want is Sony out there listening.
4061000	4065000	Maybe all I want, put Eye of Judgment on mobile so we can get it a million downloads
4065000	4067000	because it'll count.
4068000	4070000	Alright, anyway, anything else you want to say on that, Darcira?
4070000	4071000	No.
4071000	4073000	Alright, then why don't we move on to our next story?
4073000	4074000	No, it's me anyway.
4074000	4075000	Yes, it is.
4075000	4079000	Steam! I haven't looked at my Steam account in an age.
4079000	4082000	But Steam is adding new tags for their games.
4082000	4084000	You know, like, right now they have, like,
4085000	4087000	Difficult or Action or Souls-like.
4087000	4090000	Like, talking about Sekiro, which is hard as fuck.
4091000	4094000	So, you know, when you click on the tag, it takes you to a page about the tag.
4094000	4095000	You can see what it is.
4095000	4098000	Well, they are doing LGBTQ Plus tags now.
4098000	4108000	So these are games that are either related to LGBTQ Plus issues or have interest.
4108000	4113000	Or I think also maybe including the developer, maybe?
4115000	4123000	But it's to help games that may be a little more niche or smaller be more discoverable.
4123000	4132000	You know, especially now that people will look for games that are going to represent the world they live in or the world they want to live in.
4132000	4133000	Sure.
4133000	4140000	You know, like, when Dream Daddy came out, what would the average person think if they just see a bunch of dudes and Dream Daddy?
4141000	4146000	They wouldn't know it's necessarily about, you know, man daddies.
4148000	4149000	No, I gotcha. I gotcha.
4149000	4151000	Excuse me. That cake's that bad.
4152000	4154000	They could be looking for a sugar daddy.
4156000	4157000	You know what they should do?
4157000	4158000	What?
4158000	4159000	They should do a sequel and call it Bear Hunt.
4162000	4164000	Bears and Cubs and Otters, oh my.
4164000	4166000	Oh my. There's animals for everything.
4166000	4168000	It's neat. I mean, happy pride.
4168000	4174000	It definitely does seem like, hey, it's nice to see a company actually doing something besides releasing a rainbow logo for pride.
4174000	4175000	That's pretty cool.
4176000	4181000	And I think, you know, there's a lot of, especially when it comes to, like, the stories that really go in depth.
4181000	4186000	There's a lot of great games out there that explore, you know, same sex relationships.
4187000	4197000	And maybe if you're somebody that wants to see yourself represented in there because you grew up in a world where it was always, you know, hero rescues princess.
4197000	4200000	And, you know, they live happily ever after and that sort of thing.
4201000	4206000	You know, if you want to find something that maybe is a little more representative for you, I think it's cool that Steam is allowing, like, a way to do that.
4207000	4213000	And this actually comes, though, after the non-approved tags lost their hub.
4214000	4221000	And it did leave a lot of developers just behind because they had made these games to tell queer stories.
4221000	4230000	And so by putting it back and keeping it, you know, as something now that's a true curated tag, it puts that visibility back on there.
4231000	4233000	And this isn't, you know, just rainbow capitalism.
4234000	4240000	They make no money off of putting that on there other than maybe whatever revenue might come.
4241000	4242000	I don't exactly know how that works.
4242000	4254000	But at any rate, this is really, really good for visibility and good for people, for representation.
4255000	4261000	And there's a quote in here from one of the people who actually contacted Valve directly about the lack of a tag.
4262000	4267000	He said, people are going to be shitty no matter what. The tag is important.
4268000	4269000	Yeah. Very cool.
4269000	4276000	PixelPaka's in chat says, interesting timing with how they recently blocked a non-explicit lesbian visual novel from releasing on Steam.
4277000	4279000	But they later allowed it after people spoke up about it.
4280000	4284000	So there may still be some problems with how things are being implemented consistently.
4285000	4293000	But, you know, it's nice to at least see them kind of take this step and make it a little easier because the Steam store kind of can be a mess.
4294000	4295000	I attributed that to the wrong person.
4295000	4303000	It's a developer named NOHUA, N-O-H-U-A, I guess is an acronym.
4304000	4309000	But it's someone on their Discord chat who said that. The people are going to be shitty no matter what.
4310000	4317000	But I'm going to be honest. I don't usually do the click tags on Steam. I realize other people do, so that's cool.
4318000	4325000	Twitter for me has been a huge, and Facebook to some extent, even though there's so much garbage on Facebook to sift through.
4326000	4331000	And there's a lot of garbage on Twitter too, quite honestly. But I try to curate different lists of people.
4332000	4340000	I have a list of basically gay gamer and LGBTQ plus gamers that I follow on Twitter.
4340000	4349000	And honestly, if people recommend a game because they're like, oh, this story was so good and I felt seen by it, I'm way more likely to check it out based on that.
4350000	4352000	Nothing is ever going to beat a personal recommendation in that regard.
4353000	4359000	So I kind of feel like the best way, if you want to find games like that, the internet is a great place.
4360000	4364000	Find a little club. Find your niche out there of people like you.
4365000	4366000	Find your tribe.
4366000	4367000	Find your tribe.
4368000	4374000	Yeah, find your tribe. That's a great way to put it. There's plenty of gay gaming, bear gaming groups or whatever on Facebook.
4375000	4383000	I'm sure Dark Sakura, I don't know if there's necessarily ace gaming groups, but there's certainly got to be ace groups on Facebook, and the topic of gaming surely comes up.
4384000	4392000	Well, you know, when I asked the first GamerX that I attended, for Borderlands, I was like, when are we going to see ace characters?
4392000	4394000	Like, actually, we have one. There you go.
4395000	4396000	There you go.
4397000	4400000	I was like, oh, that's right, because I didn't see any semblance of romantic anything.
4401000	4408000	And now we've got more ace characters, you know, on TV or in shows or in comics, and I'm really glad to see the representation.
4408000	4425000	You know, I would like for, you know, when you're browsing that tab, you know, then you have like maybe a sub thing, you know, has ace character, has pan romantic, intersex character, you know, something like that.
4426000	4430000	I don't, I mean, yes and no. Like, I just want to see descriptions to help me figure it out.
4430000	4439000	But at the same time, I don't, our community is already so fragmented and so segmented, I feel like that togetherness is something we have to work on a lot.
4440000	4442000	But like, I don't want to discount what you're saying either, because I do see the advantages of that.
4443000	4445000	But I just worry about having all those little buckets.
4446000	4447000	I'm going to say one thing.
4448000	4457000	That same argument has been used against trans women and queer women from organizing in their own spaces to discuss the issues within the LGBT community.
4457000	4462000	But I think a video game store and that are two like super different things.
4463000	4468000	But also, I just accept the fact trans women are women, period. Like, there's no debating that.
4469000	4470000	But their struggles are going to be different than...
4471000	4475000	And I understand. But shouldn't that, like that could be in a description or something. I just don't want it...
4476000	4483000	Well, no, I understand that, but I'm just meaning like the descriptions will say something, hey, has characters like this in it.
4483000	4497000	Here's my point. Here's my real point is that, and it actually kind of piggies back on what you said in response there, is that like gay dudes kind of need to see those trans stories and the people that are also in their family.
4498000	4499000	Totally.
4500000	4501000	And that's why I said what I said.
4501000	4514000	The biggest transphobia that I see second to straight white men is gay white men. I see a lot of misogyny in amongst, you know, gay men.
4515000	4521000	Oh, did you see that Tales from the City? There's a scene in it that'll knock your socks off. Oh my God.
4522000	4524000	I just knew the thing about the sisters in vodka.
4525000	4526000	Oh yeah, that's in the first episode.
4527000	4533000	Now I'm going to have to watch that show because I hear there's a lot. If it's a misogynist getting like, you know, punched in the face, I'm down for it.
4534000	4544000	The person does not get their comeuppance, if that's what you're hoping for. But it's definitely a scene where I think it makes the viewer kind of like...
4545000	4551000	It's a viewer thinking moment and like, who am I really rooting for in this moment? I think it's a teachable moment more than anything.
4551000	4558000	And I think that's why it's written really well because it doesn't necessarily, you know, and then he punched him in the face. Yay!
4559000	4561000	Some of my friends, though, are in that first episode.
4562000	4563000	That's really cool.
4564000	4565000	I'll have to go look.
4566000	4569000	Anyway, we digressed a little bit, but that happens here at OLR if you've never been here before. Let's move on.
4570000	4578000	And getting onto a topic that no matter where you are on the rainbow or anywhere else, I'm sure a lot of people are getting excited about this idea.
4578000	4595000	Yeah, well, especially with Mario Maker 2 coming out this week and then also the fact that we saw during E3, they kind of teased a little bit of this chamber dungeon mode that allows you to create your own dungeons and share them in Link's Awakening.
4595000	4610000	So that, of course, prompted the question to E.G. Onomura, I can't pronounce the names today, that, hey, so if this mode is successful, will you make Zelda Maker?
4611000	4617000	And he said, you know, I can't predict the future, but if people do love this idea of arranging dungeons, I'll keep that in mind going forward.
4618000	4622000	So it's not a no. So what they're saying is, there's a chance.
4622000	4624000	So you're saying there's a chance?
4625000	4626000	Yes.
4627000	4631000	So, but in order to make it happen, you have to buy tons of copies of the upcoming Zelda release.
4632000	4635000	I don't know about that. I would say just like, you know, making lots of dungeons and sharing them and utilizing that feature.
4636000	4637000	Yeah.
4638000	4639000	I mean, yeah, it would be cool.
4640000	4647000	You've got to think, I think honestly a lot of it also rides on how well this, you know, because next week Super Mario Maker 2 comes out and I think a lot of people are going to be really thrilled about that.
4648000	4659000	So, you know, if that continues to do well, I don't know if they're necessarily going to think about a Mario Maker 3 or if they might think about what other of our games will this formula kind of work on, you know?
4660000	4661000	I want to see an NES remix maker.
4662000	4667000	I would love that. But at the same time, I also realize that some ideas might be more complex in execution than we think.
4668000	4674000	But I love Nintendo getting into this creation and creativity space.
4675000	4676000	Yeah.
4677000	4683000	Namely like Mario Maker is basically, I mean, you know, hello, Mario Paint was a creative game to some extent.
4684000	4685000	So we can't say like Nintendo's never been here.
4686000	4693000	But not just the fact that it is like, you know, something creative, but it's using one of their big IPs to do it and with the shareableness that it has.
4694000	4696000	And I know the game's taken a lot of shit for not being able to play games all along with your friends.
4697000	4698000	Obviously they've heard that they're going to fix that and so forth.
4699000	4704000	But I just love seeing Nintendo kind of get into that in this internet age, you know, that it's basically their own version, a little big planet.
4705000	4706000	So I kind of want to see kind of where it goes from here.
4707000	4708000	I want to see their own version of a little big planet.
4709000	4718000	Yeah. Sia Tabiri in chat says, Game Theory released a video today on YouTube's effect on new gaming trends and the rise and fall of certain game franchises.
4719000	4724000	Oh, sure. I mean, not just YouTube, but Twitch and all the places where you can watch, you know, gameplay footage, I think definitely.
4725000	4734000	I mean, games like Minecraft, to some extent, probably wouldn't be as big as they are if it were not for YouTube and Twitch.
4734000	4735000	Yeah.
4736000	4739000	And Player Unknown Battlegrounds and therefore Fortnite, Battle Royale.
4740000	4741000	And even before that...
4742000	4743000	I don't think it could not really be as big of a deal as it was.
4744000	4749000	No, even before the H1Z1, there was... I'm trying to think what else.
4750000	4753000	Well, real quick, let me continue Sia Tabiri's thoughts.
4754000	4760000	I think YouTubers can help push a Zelda maker into reality if the LA dungeon maker ends up being successful there.
4760000	4766000	They blamed YouTube for the failure of Mortal Kombat 11. I heard Mortal Kombat 11 was like doing phenomenally well.
4767000	4768000	Yeah.
4769000	4773000	They've got more DLC coming out too. They just did the Shang Tsung release and all that. Yeah, it's great.
4774000	4779000	But Sia Tabiri does say, because of the monetization rules, cursing, violence, etc. lead to demonetization.
4780000	4789000	So maybe if you're hanging out on YouTube a lot, it feels like Mortal Kombat 11 is not as present because people don't want to make videos about it because they're going to get demonetized due to the extreme level of violence in the game.
4790000	4793000	Here's one channel I've been doing nothing but.
4794000	4796000	That's a YouTube thing in my opinion, but we won't go there.
4797000	4804000	Tiger Claw says, a Zelda maker would be interesting, but then people would design dungeons that are super hard and have very complex puzzles to pass them.
4805000	4811000	Sure, but there's always going to be the hell levels, but there's going to be people that just make cute stuff too and creative stuff.
4812000	4821000	Like, and I know I've said this on the show before and I'm going to say it again. The best thing I ever saw in LittleBigPlanet 1 was that level that was like my shrine to Parker Posey.
4822000	4828000	And you played through the level and you would unlock, because you could take pictures with the camera and like stickers you get along.
4829000	4836000	And so you just unlocked all these stickers of Parker Posey as you played the level. And there was like Parker Posey trivia that would come up as you played the level.
4836000	4843000	And I was like, this is so ridiculous that I love it because Parker Posey is pretty awesome, y'all.
4844000	4849000	I know y'all saw Scream 3, right? Hello? Party girl? Anybody? Waiting for Guffman?
4850000	4851000	I didn't see it.
4852000	4855000	Right, anyway. Alright, let's move on.
4856000	4861000	Obviously E3 just wrapped up and one thing that was missing from E3 was Metroid Prime 4.
4861000	4869000	It wasn't there and a lot of people noticed it was missing. And what's really strange about it, in an interview with Eurogamer, they asked,
4870000	4876000	I can't not ask you about a certain other project you're working on. Metroid Prime 4. We haven't seen anything of it at all, this E3.
4877000	4882000	Do you have an update for fans patiently waiting for it? And Kensuke Tanabe replied from Nintendo,
4883000	4889000	I shouldn't say. It's a little tricky. To be completely honest, at this E3, I just want people to pay attention to Luigi.
4889000	4895000	If I mention something about Metroid Prime 4, people will focus on that. But when the time comes, I'm so ready to talk about it.
4896000	4902000	Which led to this headline, Metroid Prime 4 was not mentioned at E3 because they wanted people to focus on Luigi's Mansion 3.
4903000	4911000	I think from that quote, we just find the reality of E3. Is that if they had brought Metroid Prime 4 to the show,
4912000	4915000	people wouldn't be asking nearly as many questions about Luigi's Mansion 3.
4915000	4921000	So I think you can read between the lines and the response there and say it was a very carefully chosen what we did,
4922000	4926000	and we didn't want to show because we wanted to control the narrative of what was being discussed.
4927000	4931000	That's what every gaming company does at E3. There's so much planning that goes into it.
4932000	4937000	But honestly, I just took it as they just said not that long ago that Metroid Prime 4 was basically rebooted.
4938000	4942000	They did that whole direction in February. So I just assumed it wasn't ready.
4942000	4949000	I was more surprised that they didn't announce like a, and here's a Metroid Prime trilogy on Switch to hold you over.
4950000	4955000	Or here's a remaster of Metroid Prime 1 where we just kind of turned up the graphics on level 3.
4956000	4957000	We did a little extra polish.
4958000	4959000	We just had AI go through and high res all the textures.
4960000	4964000	Yeah, we did a little bit, not a ton, but a little something to get you interested in it again.
4965000	4970000	Because obviously we don't want them taking too many hours from Metroid Prime 4, but I think we all know that.
4970000	4971000	Have another company do it.
4972000	4973000	Yeah, yeah, that'd be cool.
4974000	4980000	And as to 100 Matt does say, they made that announcement six months ago saying they were starting from scratch for Metroid Prime 4.
4981000	4984000	So it's kind of nuts to expect that they have something for E3 in six months.
4985000	4990000	And vidpower573 says, I assume Nintendo put all their focus on the big reveal of Breath of the Wild 2.
4991000	4997000	Sia Tabiri says, how about the big Animal Crossing thing? Wouldn't that have overshadowed MP4 or the opposite?
4997000	5000000	I kind of think there's room for both because they're such different games.
5001000	5005000	But I also think that about Luigi's Mansion 3, I mean that there's room for both games.
5006000	5011000	But perhaps the excitement of something like Metroid Prime 4 may have made people only ask about that.
5012000	5014000	And so I kind of get it in a way.
5015000	5018000	But I think that game is still going to be a little ways out. I don't think we're going to see it right away.
5019000	5022000	But you know, if they rebooted it, then they clearly had a reason for doing it.
5023000	5024000	So we'll see what happens.
5024000	5030000	Moving on. Let's get to our next story. Let's get a little political, I guess, in this next story.
5031000	5034000	Well, I found this actually kind of randomly.
5035000	5041000	And I will say this. I'm a Bernie babe. I like Bernie. He's got really good chances.
5042000	5043000	And that's all I'm going to say.
5044000	5053000	But Bernie, being the lovely socialist like he is, brought up video game developers.
5054000	5060000	And on top of that, he actually is encouraging them to unionize.
5061000	5063000	And I will read the quote from his tweet. Sorry.
5064000	5067000	The video game industry made $43 billion in revenue last year.
5068000	5073000	The workers responsible for that profit deserve to collectively bargain as a part of a union.
5074000	5080000	I'm glad to see unions like IATSC and the broader Game Workers Movement organizing such workers.
5081000	5087000	And he linked the Time article about the burnout going on rampant in the industry.
5091000	5102000	But the other thing, too, is just that he's always been talking for people to unionize, to stand up for their rights.
5103000	5109000	And I think that it was actually pretty, a bit surprising, but very good to see that he's including the video game industry with that same call.
5110000	5115000	Especially in light of the recent issues that developers have been working with.
5116000	5117000	That crunch time bullshit.
5118000	5133000	And it's also really good. Even just recently, AFL-CIO published a letter in Kotaku for calling for developers to join in with their union and everything.
5133000	5140000	So the Game Workers Unite, though, is a pretty good place to start looking if you are in the video game industry and want to unionize.
5141000	5147000	I think it's pretty neat that a politician has, and to be disclosed, I have not figured out, there's still so many candidates in it.
5148000	5154000	And I'm also focused on the fact, I just want to make sure whoever comes out of that battle royale thing is the one that feeds you-know-who.
5155000	5159000	Just remember, Biden called Anita Hill a liar.
5159000	5166000	You know I'm a very strong opinion that now is not the time to cut all the people down because we don't know who's going to come out of it.
5167000	5169000	So I'm going to support whoever comes out of it.
5170000	5185000	But as far as it goes, I think it is really neat to see that there is somebody who is willing to call out the game industry like that because of the fact that the game industry has always been something that is very underground.
5185000	5189000	We always think, we kind of forget it's as big as it really is, right?
5190000	5194000	Because a lot of us come from the 80s and 90s era of when games were things that nerds did.
5195000	5199000	But now the reality is, game is everything that Hollywood is and more.
5200000	5203000	And certainly politicians have had their piece to say on Hollywood, so all of them.
5204000	5206000	So why not be commenting on the games industry as well?
5207000	5211000	So I think that's really cool that somebody is talking about it, and I'm sure more will too.
5211000	5218000	Well on top of that, Bernie also did poke at Disney to pay their workers more after Avengers Endgame.
5219000	5221000	You know, with the big ass money that that makes.
5222000	5232000	I mean, I actually want to see the industries taxed more and see them be responsible for taking care of the people that they're making money off of.
5233000	5239000	So this is even more of a, I've cemented for me my decision.
5239000	5245000	I'll say this, and folks in chat are kind of asking questions and stuff.
5246000	5252000	If I had to vote tomorrow, and not to get into debate, but if I had to vote tomorrow, I'd vote for Elizabeth Warren, is who I'd vote for right now.
5253000	5256000	But I totally reserve the right to change my mind.
5257000	5263000	Right now, I'm in primary brain mode. I'm looking at who would best fit my ideals.
5264000	5266000	If Bernie wasn't there, it would be Warren for me.
5266000	5272000	Biden would be in the toilet, because he's nothing without Obama, to keep him in fucking control.
5273000	5278000	But at any rate, right now, I'm thinking in terms of primaries.
5279000	5283000	I'm thinking in terms of putting my support behind the one I think is going to do the best job.
5284000	5293000	And whoever comes out of it, I'm probably still going to vote for him, even if it's Biden, because he's a big, terrible, misogynist racist.
5294000	5295000	But...
5296000	5300000	I think he's old and foolish. I don't know if those other things are true.
5301000	5304000	Go back and watch the trial with Anita Hill.
5305000	5306000	I'm not going to get apologized. I'm just not.
5307000	5315000	But at any rate, that's why I'm focusing more on primary right now.
5316000	5318000	Putting my weight behind who I think is going to be the best job.
5318000	5323000	And this is just another thing that, and I didn't post it because, oh, I want everyone to vote for Bernie.
5324000	5329000	It's because he's really one of the first people who has said something about it in the political spectrum.
5330000	5336000	And one reason why I did say what I said about Elizabeth Warren is one thing that has constantly impressed me about her,
5337000	5341000	and I tie this into this, and why you bring up this Bernie thing, and it's not like a personal preference or whatever, I get that,
5341000	5347000	is because Warren has come out and said, this is my plan for this. This is my plan for that.
5348000	5349000	This is what I'm going to do. This is what I'm going to do.
5350000	5355000	And she's like laid it out. And that's one thing I really admire about her is that I feel like she's not blowing smoke up my ass,
5356000	5359000	which I can't say that about necessarily everybody I've ever seen run for that office.
5360000	5367000	So that's, you know, so if they feel the need to respond to this, and I'll kind of start to wrap up with this comment,
5367000	5371000	if they feel the need to respond to this, I'm encouraged that maybe Warren might come out and say,
5372000	5375000	yes, the game developers need to unionize, and this is what I'm going to do to Google, and this is what I'm going to do,
5376000	5379000	and this is what I think they should do, and so forth. I hope, you know, because she's kind of done that for me so far.
5380000	5381000	I want them on a ticket together.
5382000	5386000	I don't want to get too, I don't think they ultimately will. They're both great. Don't get me wrong.
5387000	5388000	But I would kill to see it.
5389000	5392000	Everybody would, but the point of a ticket is you have to have a little column A, a little column B.
5392000	5393000	You know what I mean? So, anyway.
5394000	5398000	All right, moving on. Who are you voting for, Loki? No, I'm just kidding. Don't answer. Go to the next question.
5399000	5402000	I mean, I've got to back my man Trump, because he's going to be off.
5403000	5404000	No one's going to vote for him.
5405000	5407000	No one in intelligence is going to vote for him.
5408000	5411000	People probably watching this, there are some that might, but I just...
5412000	5413000	Didn't stop. Just stop.
5414000	5418000	I'm going to say, like, really listen to the complaints of the people complaining,
5418000	5426000	and, like, for me, here's the thing. This administration has put the T in LGBTQ under attack consistently,
5427000	5431000	and I'm going to stick up for my brothers and sisters, because it's fucked up what is happening.
5432000	5433000	It is beyond belief.
5434000	5437000	How many trans people of color have been murdered just in the last month and a half?
5438000	5441000	Yeah. So, anyway, without, sorry, I know we've probably gone too far in the deep end so far.
5442000	5443000	You know what? It needs to be said.
5443000	5444000	It needs to be said.
5445000	5447000	Like, yeah, but I'm just like, you know, if you are somebody that's, you know, on that train or whatever,
5448000	5453000	like, all I can say to try to meet you halfway is, like, just try to listen to why people are as bothered as they are.
5454000	5459000	So, anyway, moving on. Loki. Non-political.
5460000	5461000	Oh, wait, no.
5462000	5463000	It's semi-political.
5464000	5470000	We'll try to make it not as political, but basically, so there was an interview with Phil Spencer talking a little bit about the Xbox platform,
5470000	5477000	because you remember during the Xbox press conference, they had mentioned a few things talking about, you know,
5478000	5482000	how they want to build a safe and inclusive gaming environment for everyone.
5483000	5491000	So, you know, along with that, you know, he's kind of said that basically, hey, listen, you know, to be upfront,
5492000	5494000	everyone says, oh, free speech, we should be allowed to do whatever.
5495000	5496000	Xbox Live is not a free speech platform.
5496000	5503000	It's not a place where anybody can come and say anything, and we're working to ensure it's safe and inclusive environment for everybody.
5504000	5511000	I don't want to be opaque about it. I want to be out there in front and center so that you understand our motivation.
5512000	5521000	So, of course, what they're going to be doing along with that is looking to identify potentials for abuse and misuse on our platform,
5522000	5523000	and they're going to fix problems quickly.
5523000	5527000	They said hate and harassment have no place in gaming, and I think that's a good start,
5528000	5534000	considering that the Xbox Live community for the longest time had kind of this big,
5535000	5542000	you kind of put hate speech in like asshole children along with, you know, kind of, it's synonymous with that platform,
5543000	5548000	and it's kind of good to see them trying to move away from that, because really it shouldn't.
5548000	5556000	It doesn't belong in any platform, really, but people, when they hide behind anonymity, they act like complete assholes,
5557000	5563000	so you can't fix the problem completely, but you can sure as hell make it hard for them.
5564000	5568000	I think it's great. Say what you will about whether this will work or not and change either image,
5569000	5574000	but I do love, Microsoft is in such a better direction now under Phil Spencer than it has been probably ever,
5574000	5578000	so I'm going to give Phil Spencer major, major kudos. I'm such a fan.
5579000	5586000	That being said, I think it's great when a company says they will do something and that they're going to,
5587000	5593000	I mean, even if they're not going to eventually be successful because you can't police every conversation out there and so forth,
5594000	5601000	I think that has to start by kind of setting the stage of this is gaming and everybody can game,
5601000	5605000	and to hear that kind of at the corporate level, that that's what they support,
5606000	5610000	and that gaming is not some exclusive click in somebody's basement anymore,
5611000	5618000	that we believe that everybody should be able to play games, I think that is a huge start in setting the right tone,
5619000	5624000	but you add anonymity and people are always going to get ugly and things like that,
5625000	5629000	so I'm not sure, again, how successful it's going to be. I'm kind of on the same page with SSG100Matt,
5629000	5634000	where he says, on this XBL topic, I'll believe it when I see it.
5635000	5639000	So, yeah, I kind of don't think Xbox Live is going to change overnight, that's for sure,
5640000	5643000	but it is very nice for Microsoft to kind of say like, you know, this is what we believe,
5644000	5647000	and these are the actions we're going to take to try to demonstrate it. It's something.
5648000	5652000	You're not going to, because the way it's going ain't working, so there's that.
5653000	5657000	All right, Questbuster in chat says, everyone not on my friends list is muted,
5657000	5660000	and honestly, that's how I tend to play online these days as well,
5661000	5664000	but I do play MMOs and stuff where I get exposed to people with text chat,
5665000	5672000	but honestly, the number of dirtbags I run into on something like Final Fantasy XIV or even WoW is like,
5673000	5676000	especially if I don't join general chat, I'll see a lot if I join general chat,
5677000	5682000	but if I play Final Fantasy XIV in a party or something, I very rarely, very rarely see shitty behavior.
5682000	5686000	Sure, I do see shitty behavior, but it's the vast minority of what I run into,
5687000	5690000	and it's very easy to just drop the party, block the person, and re-cue,
5691000	5694000	or you may take a 30-minute penalty, but you know what, it's worth it,
5695000	5698000	than having to go back in the dungeon with that particular individual,
5699000	5702000	because most people just want to play the fucking game.
5703000	5706000	Unfortunately, some people get on there and are really loud and ruin it for everybody else.
5706000	5712000	Alright, anyway, let's move on though, we've got a few more stories to cover here.
5713000	5716000	We're going to get to a story about Twitch, actually, very meta.
5717000	5718000	We're going to talk about Twitch on Twitch.
5719000	5721000	Twitch also bought a something something this week,
5722000	5723000	so Niantic made a purchase, but so did Twitch.
5724000	5727000	Twitch bought a company called Bebo, I think is how you pronounce it.
5728000	5731000	I have never heard of Bebo, but apparently Bebo, like back in the day,
5732000	5735000	was Facebook, Myspace in the UK.
5736000	5737000	I've never heard of that.
5738000	5739000	Yeah, but it was never really something that caught on here.
5740000	5744000	Because I think that's where, like, one of the Asian chat sites derived from.
5745000	5747000	Oh yeah, I think so, I think you're right.
5748000	5751000	Because, you know, Friendster, it was like kind of the first,
5752000	5754000	a lot of people thought Friendster had a very Asian audience
5755000	5756000	after most people kind of left it for Myspace.
5757000	5762000	And Google had a network, what the hell, it was not Plus,
5763000	5764000	they had one before it.
5764000	5765000	And I can't remember the name of it,
5766000	5767000	but it was another one of those ones that everybody got on,
5768000	5769000	and then it was huge in, like, Brazil.
5770000	5772000	It was like a huge, God, what, Orkut?
5773000	5774000	Was that the name of it? Was that a Google thing at one point?
5775000	5776000	I think it was. It was called Orkut, something like that.
5777000	5779000	So, I should bring up chat because I bet somebody knows.
5780000	5783000	It's one alternative to Facebook that is shitty.
5784000	5786000	So, anyway, Twitch bought Bebo.
5787000	5788000	Well, why would Twitch want to buy a social network?
5789000	5792000	Because, even though that's what Bebo used to do,
5792000	5795000	what happened in July 2013, the original founders of Bebo
5796000	5799000	bought it back from AOL for just a million dollars,
5800000	5803000	and Bebo started focusing on game streaming and esports.
5804000	5806000	They even offered their own version of the OBS tool,
5807000	5808000	kind of like Streamlabs does,
5809000	5811000	that some Twitch streamers still actually use right now.
5812000	5814000	So, they found that streamer tournaments
5815000	5816000	started becoming a big thing.
5817000	5818000	So, they actually ended up closing
5819000	5820000	the general streaming stuff on Twitch,
5820000	5823000	and they actually worked on their gaming events side of the business.
5824000	5827000	So, their focus basically is streaming gaming events,
5828000	5830000	and that is what Twitch now wants to buy because,
5831000	5834000	and the thought is, Twitch does a lot of esports streaming,
5835000	5837000	like I think Overwatch League is probably on right now,
5838000	5839000	but that's not a Twitch thing.
5840000	5841000	They just air it, right?
5842000	5843000	I used to watch the Heroes of the Storm stuff,
5844000	5846000	until Blizzard cancelled it, but that was all on Twitch.
5847000	5849000	Twitch would like to have their own.
5850000	5851000	It does have their own esports stuff,
5852000	5853000	but I don't think it's very, very large,
5854000	5855000	and maybe as big as they want it to be.
5856000	5859000	So, this might be something that kind of ups their esports games,
5860000	5862000	which, whether that's a thing you're into or not,
5863000	5865000	is a big part of, I think, the future of Twitch and so forth,
5866000	5867000	and just streaming online in general.
5868000	5870000	There's probably 100,000 people watching Overwatch League right now.
5871000	5873000	It's no small audience to laugh at.
5876000	5877000	There you go. I just think it's interesting
5878000	5879000	that Bebo has that history
5880000	5881000	of like, oh, it was a social network,
5882000	5883000	then it was like a Twitch streaming thing,
5884000	5885000	now it's going to be something that Twitch owns.
5886000	5889000	So, anyway, TigerClaw in chat says, Google Buzz.
5890000	5892000	No, it was even before that, believe it or not.
5893000	5894000	I know Buzz. No, it was before that.
5895000	5896000	I think it was Orkut. I really do think that was the name of it.
5897000	5898000	Like O-R-K-U-T or something like that.
5899000	5900000	Let's see. Nifty805 in chat,
5901000	5904000	who I notice has a TwitchCon 2019 thing on their profile.
5905000	5906000	I'm still sitting on the fence with that.
5907000	5908000	I'd like to go to TwitchCon.
5908000	5911000	I just found out one of my closest friends is moving to San Diego,
5912000	5914000	which I'm really sad about because he's one of my closest friends.
5915000	5918000	But, hey, I have a place to stay in San Diego.
5919000	5921000	So, it might happen anyway.
5922000	5924000	But Nifty805 says, Alaska 5000, come to Brazil.
5925000	5928000	Well, there's a lot of people in Brazil, believe it or not.
5929000	5932000	It's funny because when we talk about games,
5933000	5935000	we really end up sometimes in this bubble
5935000	5942000	where the U.S., Canada, Japan, the U.K., that blob,
5943000	5946000	the U.K., which everybody kind of sometimes assumes is just Britain,
5947000	5949000	unless you live over there. But no, the U.K. is several countries, right?
5950000	5951000	And that's it. Gaming doesn't exist everywhere else.
5952000	5955000	And that's why I love that we have callers to this show,
5956000	5957000	like Act Deaf, certainly most notably,
5958000	5960000	who's like, hey, this is what it's really like in Mexico, right?
5961000	5962000	And then it sometimes humbles us and reminds us,
5962000	5966000	oh, yeah, there's gamers in all these different countries
5967000	5970000	we don't always hear about. There's lots of gamers in Brazil.
5971000	5973000	How often do we talk about video games in Brazil?
5974000	5975000	Almost never.
5976000	5979000	Yeah, exactly. So, you know, just kind of ties into that whole thing.
5980000	5981000	All right. Anyway.
5982000	5987000	Oh, and YYR points out, Overwatch League has only 62,000 viewers right now.
5988000	5989000	Okay, well, I guess because it's getting later.
5989000	5992000	Or they have to compete against Summer Games done quick right now.
5993000	5995000	That's probably more people watching that.
5996000	5997000	All right. Anyway.
5998000	6000000	Okay, thank you, VidPower. VidPower went to Wikipedia
6001000	6005000	and confirmed that Google did operate Orca as their first social media thing.
6006000	6008000	Thank you. All right. I remembered. I don't always remember.
6009000	6010000	Well, now we're going to remember together,
6011000	6013000	because every week Dark Soccer likes to take us down memory lane
6014000	6017000	with a segment she calls the Classic Game of the Week.
6017000	6019000	And she's going to step into the gaming vault and find a game that she thinks,
6020000	6023000	hey, you brats, check this game out.
6024000	6027000	It's 10 years older or more and is worthy of your attention.
6028000	6029000	And I'm going to warn you before I get the footage up here,
6030000	6033000	it's going to go blank for a minute because I screwed up some of the preload tonight.
6034000	6035000	So we're going to go blank for just a minute,
6036000	6038000	but Dark Soccer is going to tell us about this week's selection.
6039000	6043000	Well, I have to say why I picked it first is, number one, I love kind of obscure.
6043000	6052000	Number two, it came out in June of 2002, which what else happened in June of 2002?
6053000	6056000	Oh, I get it. OK.
6057000	6059000	This, you know, rabid, rabid ferret of a show.
6060000	6063000	Yes, I love it. All right. So what is it? What is the classic game of the week?
6064000	6065000	Shante. Shante, we stay.
6066000	6069000	Shante, we stay. Absolutely. Which still isn't loading.
6070000	6072000	Well, at any rate, go ahead and talk about it. I'll fix the video.
6073000	6079000	Shante is a platforming game that was developed by WayForward and published by Capcom.
6080000	6085000	It came out for the Game Boy Color in 2002, and it was the first game in the series.
6086000	6092000	It did have sequels. So Shante, Risky's Revenge, Shante and the Pirate's Curse, and Shante, Half Genie Hero.
6093000	6100000	So basically you play as a half genie named Shante who has to travel across sequin land,
6100000	6103000	which, I don't know, take me to sequin land.
6104000	6110000	And she has to foil the domination plans of a pirate named Risky Boots.
6111000	6112000	Rob, I think I found my new drag name.
6113000	6114000	Risky Boots? I like that.
6115000	6122000	So she learns dances as you go along and gets items that make her get stronger and unlock new abilities in different places,
6123000	6125000	and then she can go kick Risky's ass.
6125000	6134000	It was pretty obscure, this first one was, because it came out a year after the Game Boy Advance was already out.
6135000	6139000	Oh. Yeah, because I was like, I don't know this first game nearly as well as I know the sequels.
6140000	6150000	Well, at any rate, it did get very great reviews, and it's been included as one of the best games for the Game Boy Color, and even called a cult classic.
6151000	6158000	So, as I said, it's a platform adventure game. You have to go across different areas,
6159000	6163000	and your default attack has you using your hair like a whip,
6164000	6170000	and you can also get gems from defeated enemies to purchase items like potions to restore your life and damaging things,
6171000	6177000	and combat upgrades, and then you have five towns with different areas with enemies and obstacles and whatnot.
6177000	6184000	And so you just go around, you have all kinds of different dances that you can do that transform you into different animals,
6185000	6192000	including a monkey that can climb on walls, a smashing elephant, a spider that climbs on webbing in the background,
6193000	6197000	and a harpy that can fly in mid-air. And so you use those abilities to unlock other items.
6198000	6203000	You have a day and night cycle with enemies becoming stronger at night, because what a terrible night for the curse.
6203000	6207000	You can also collect fireflies that give you a reward for getting them off.
6208000	6218000	You also have warp squids, which basically they let you give them to a mother squid, and then you can warp to a dungeon. So weird.
6219000	6229000	But anyway, it's a land that was protected by genies, and then the genies had children with humans and stuff happened,
6229000	6232000	and the genies went away, and then we have to save the world.
6233000	6245000	So anyway, it started development in 1997. There's even an archived version of Wayforward's page that had a different way they were planning on taking the game,
6246000	6254000	and it was in development for PC or Playstation at the time, with 3D characters over 3D backgrounds.
6254000	6264000	It was really going to be a different game, but then they were going then back to the idea of doing it for the SNES,
6265000	6276000	and the developers pitched the game to Wayforward, and they basically greenlit a Game Boy Color of it, shopped around for a publisher,
6276000	6283000	and Capcom was the one who took the chance on them, but they had them hold back the release of the game.
6284000	6288000	And finally, though this did give them time, but when the Game Boy Advance was already out,
6289000	6294000	they worked on making the game, even though it's a Game Boy Color game, look good on the Game Boy Advance.
6294000	6306000	There are no public sales figures, but hearsay is about 25,000 copies of the game were produced and sold out,
6307000	6310000	but there was no second run, so the game is a little bit hard to find.
6311000	6318000	They basically said that creatively they made the game a little bit too mature in brand,
6318000	6324000	because the character was sexy or something, I don't know, she's pixels, you know, with boobs.
6325000	6333000	But basically, you know, and also their market data was saying that female lead character won't sell, blah blah blah,
6334000	6340000	but they were just trying to reach an audience, and the game really was received very well, IGN gave them great ratings.
6341000	6347000	I just have to say really quick, yeah, this game, I would never have believed that this was a Game Boy Color game.
6348000	6353000	I don't know if we're seeing, I don't know if World of the Long Plays did a video here where it's on in advance,
6354000	6357000	so maybe we're seeing the enhancements or whatever, I would have never guessed this was a Game Boy game.
6358000	6361000	I would have thought this was something that was on the, something that had more advanced tech,
6362000	6366000	like that came out after Game Boy, like maybe the Lynx or the, you know, the Sega's thing or whatever.
6367000	6369000	It looks great for Game Boy.
6370000	6375000	And basically, the only company that gave them a bad score was Game Informer,
6376000	6382000	because this one male reviewer said the game isn't compelling enough to keep you playing it.
6383000	6384000	What, because it's a woman?
6385000	6391000	I've seen that rating a lot though from Game Informer people, when a game has a female protagonist.
6392000	6394000	I'd like to know more about that, but anyway, later.
6394000	6399000	But it's gone on to be considered a cult classic, it's been considered,
6400000	6406000	and although funny enough, Game Informer, another Game Informer guy, Ben Reeves, called it the 15th best Game Boy game,
6407000	6410000	and felt that it was overlooked, so okay, maybe they're better now.
6411000	6421000	There were sequels, there was supposed to be a Shantae Risky Revolution for Game Boy Advance,
6421000	6424000	or Shantae Risky Waters for the Nintendo DS.
6425000	6431000	We had Shantae's Risky Revenge in 2009, and it was available for DSiWare.
6433000	6439000	And they were gonna do it as an episodic, and so instead, though, they did it as a standalone sequel.
6440000	6442000	It was ported to iOS, Windows, and PlayStation 4.
6443000	6447000	The third one was Shantae and the Pirate's Curse that came out on the 3DS eShop,
6447000	6452000	and then it also came out on Wii U, Windows, PS4, Xbox One, and Amazon Fire.
6453000	6463000	And then the last one that was out was Shantae Half Genie Hero, that came out for, on Windows, PlayStation 4, Vita, Wii U,
6464000	6471000	which I have the Wii U one, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch, and it is also the first HD game in the series.
6472000	6483000	It was done via crowdfunding on Kickstarter and PayPal, which doubled its original goal and went to about $950,000.
6484000	6492000	And a fifth game is in the works, supposed to be released this year, I don't know anymore about it, it doesn't have a name,
6493000	6497000	but it's for PC, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and Apple Arcade.
6497000	6509000	Also, Shantae was re-released for Nintendo 3DS Virtual Console, and it apparently is still available on eShop, so you have a chance to play it.
6512000	6514000	Is that it? Shantae, we stay.
6515000	6520000	Alright, Shantae, you stay. It's the classic game of the week, a game as old as this show. I can't believe it. Shantae.
6521000	6522000	Slightly older, but yeah.
6522000	6528000	Slightly older. Oh, did the video actually finish? Alright. Good pick, good pick.
6529000	6534000	Because again, I only know the subsequent sequels, I don't know a lot about the original, so very cool.
6535000	6536000	Yeah, it's a good little game.
6537000	6543000	I have the Wii U and the 3DS versions from that Humble Bundle that they did a while back.
6544000	6551000	YYR in chat says, I just checked and the current going price for authentic copies of this game on eBay averaged around $400.
6552000	6556000	You can get reproductions for cheap though. Wow, that's a crazy expensive game, that's for sure.
6557000	6559000	I think we might have one.
6560000	6561000	Wow.
6562000	6570000	I'll have to look, I mean, I've been trying, I'm considering actually selling some of our pricier games if someone wants to make an offer.
6571000	6572000	Well, they gotta know what there is.
6573000	6574000	There's the final fight guy.
6575000	6576000	You've been trying to get rid of this for a while.
6577000	6579000	Well, we didn't try to, I just had them sort of on the think about it list.
6580000	6584000	Ninja Gaiden trilogy, Secret of Evermore.
6585000	6588000	Is that considered rare? I think I have a card of that somewhere.
6589000	6590000	Maybe.
6591000	6593000	We have a few things, so just ask.
6594000	6595000	Alright.
6596000	6597000	But Dracula X isn't for sale.
6597000	6606000	Alright, well a little different tonight, but we don't have an in-studio break with a prior rendered video or anything like that because the project I wanted to do I wasn't able to get done.
6607000	6611000	So we're just gonna go right into the next segment of our show and tackle some rapid fire news. Loki.
6612000	6613000	Yeah, so there's some pretty cool stuff.
6614000	6624000	So there's a brand new mod for Starcraft Remastered that transforms the game's look to look a little bit more like something you would see.
6624000	6629000	I don't know, kind of like Castle Crashers or something like that.
6630000	6635000	So it's Carbot Animations. They had a Starcraft series that he did.
6636000	6645000	And it's basically the animations from that with all the graphics redone in the game to look like his animated series.
6646000	6650000	And it's awesome. It's actually kind of officially blessed by Blizzard as well.
6650000	6655000	They even unveiled it during this Korean event, but you can check it out.
6658000	6660000	It looks pretty cool. It looks like a completely different game.
6661000	6666000	That's very cool. I like the idea of reskinning the game. I wish Blizzard would open it up to more stuff like that.
6667000	6670000	I guess you could do a lot with the Starcraft 2 arcade mode, but I know this is the original.
6671000	6675000	Well, I mean, it's still the remastered, so they probably added some more of those features in there as well.
6675000	6683000	True. All right. So this is something I think Jamie would be interested in, but apparently now they have a mod in Mass Effect 2.
6684000	6685000	They can play in first person.
6686000	6687000	No, thank you.
6688000	6691000	So yes, it's a brand new PC mod that you can play in first person.
6692000	6696000	You can't play the whole game, apparently, like that. It says the combat isn't working properly due to clipping issues.
6697000	6701000	But everything else from walking around talking to people is in first person.
6702000	6706000	I think the only thing that I would want is, are the cinematic scenes in that mode?
6707000	6710000	It says most of the, yeah, everything else is in it.
6711000	6715000	Okay, well then I have to seduce Scaris in first person, but other than that I would get so motion sick.
6716000	6719000	Apparently he's working on mods right now for Mass Effect 1 and 3 as well.
6720000	6721000	Nice.
6722000	6723000	So that's it.
6724000	6735000	All right, well let's move on to a topic I've already kind of brought up earlier in the show, but just so we all are clear, Summer Games Done Quick 2019 is underway.
6736000	6737000	I'm very excited about this, yes.
6738000	6742000	And I'm sure there's people that are not watching our show tonight to go watch that, which, you know, it's hard to be mad at a charity-thon.
6743000	6747000	What game are they on right now? The schedule says they would be on Devil...
6748000	6752000	The schedule says they'd be on Devil May Cry, but I'm not sure if that's on East Coast time.
6753000	6755000	It should be in my local time. So they should be on about Devil May Cry right now.
6756000	6759000	Maybe just wrapping that up and getting ready to start Streets of Rage here in a couple minutes.
6760000	6761000	So that's pretty cool.
6762000	6766000	So yeah, Summer Games Done Quick is going on, and I'm sure many of you guys will be watching.
6767000	6771000	Tonight I will throw the host after OLR to Summer Games Done Quick.
6772000	6777000	Although I'm sure, you know, I love to support the indie streamers as well, and that tends to be where we throw the host after OLR.
6777000	6782000	But tonight, you know, I know a lot of you guys are into that, so we'll throw it over there.
6783000	6789000	And I always love, you know, Taskbot, or, you know, the Taskbot block and Bad Block, of course, bad game block.
6790000	6793000	So I have to see when those are, because those are usually what I want to watch.
6794000	6798000	Oh, and Bobby says he's auditioning to do the hosting next year, do some of the voiceovers.
6799000	6800000	I know he was looking into doing that.
6800000	6805000	And actually, Jason, our voiceover guy, is there right now.
6806000	6812000	He's not doing hosting there, but he's volunteering, I guess, to learn more about the whole thing, and he's actually there at Summer Games Done Quick.
6813000	6816000	I doubt you'll see him on the camera, because, you know, there's a lot going on at that hotel.
6817000	6821000	But I was like, Jason, get some footage of all the other stuff at Summer Games Done Quick so we can kind of show some of that on OLR.
6822000	6828000	So hopefully he has the time to put that together, but I know volunteering is his first focus, and we appreciate that he even had time to do an intro tonight, really.
6828000	6834000	So, all right. And Bobby says silly games are what they call them now.
6835000	6837000	Silly games? Silly games. Oh, silly games.
6838000	6847000	All right. And one other quick story here from me, and that has to do with everybody was losing their bananas last week when they heard that Ubisoft was putting a new game out on the Wii.
6848000	6855000	Just Dance 2020 is coming out of the Wii, that's not changing, but in an interview with The Telegraph over in the UK,
6855000	6861000	Alan Core, I hope I said his name right, said, I think we're the last soldier standing when it came to the Wii.
6862000	6866000	We are the last game on the Wii, and we are happy about that, as there are still a lot of fans wanting to play on it.
6867000	6872000	Now we see they are going to the Switch, and at the end of the year, Just Dance 2020 will be one of the best games on the Switch,
6873000	6876000	because there are more and more families playing on it as it was in the Wii times.
6877000	6884000	But it was apparently also brought up at some point that this will be the last, that's it, this is the last game on the Wii.
6885000	6886000	No more after this.
6887000	6893000	I mean, they wouldn't put it on the Wii if it wasn't selling, because it costs money to produce those,
6894000	6900000	they have to make a version of the game for the Wii, and they have to publish it, and they have to make copies of it.
6901000	6904000	So if it wasn't selling, they wouldn't be putting it on that system.
6905000	6911000	So obviously it's selling, it's just they may see the drop in sales this year because there are more people converting to the Switch,
6912000	6914000	and that's just going to be where their focus is going to be for the Nintendo platforms.
6915000	6920000	And, you know, to be fair, there will always be indie stuff continuing to come out on the Wii,
6921000	6927000	because there's always going to be a cult, if you will, I'm using that term loosely, that will develop games for consoles that have been sunsetted a long time.
6928000	6932000	Hello, like Halo 2600. People still develop for the Atari 2600, you know what I mean?
6933000	6938000	So there's going to be people that still develop for the Wii, but this will be the last commercial release, certainly probably for the Wii.
6939000	6943000	Unless, I say probably because I guess you never know what will happen, but most likely.
6943000	6949000	Alright, anyhow, VidPower says shoutouts to the Wii U, the best way to play Wii games.
6950000	6955000	And I said that last week is that I don't know if it's a Wii release as much as it is, oh it's a Wii U release as well.
6956000	6962000	But yeah, I think the executive is right in the comment there that most people at this point are converting to the Switch if they haven't already.
6963000	6966000	You might have some people that are holding off on those rumors about a souped up Switch or a Switch Mini.
6966000	6977000	We don't have that on our show tonight, but I realize there's a lot of rumors from like, not hardware makers, peripheral accessories, makers of accessories.
6978000	6983000	Apparently there is a Switch Mini thing that's leaking, but we'll wait and see what comes of that.
6984000	6985000	We'll wait and see what Nintendo has to say about that.
6986000	6987000	Alright, Dark Sakura, I know you have a couple quick things for us.
6988000	6992000	I do. It's actually having to do with the Breath of the Wild sequel.
6992000	7010000	Aonuma Eiji basically had said in an interview that they wanted to do more DLC for Breath of the Wild and had so many different ideas and so many changes that they were like, nope, DLC ain't gonna cut it, we need to make this a sequel.
7011000	7017000	And so, because they had so many ideas for DLC, they just thought this would work good as its own game.
7017000	7023000	And so I'm pretty excited about that, and I still very much would hope we get to play as Zelda.
7024000	7026000	I mean, there's hints there.
7027000	7039000	But anyway, moving on from that, of course, and Bobby already talked about this, but Tesla Arcade is a thing where you can play video games in your Tesla.
7039000	7044000	You can also use the steering wheel, which is moving your tires.
7045000	7047000	And Bobby said they're expensive.
7048000	7053000	Aspessa tires, which we know about from Dan's Mustang as well, because they're special tires.
7054000	7058000	But you can play with the wheel in your car to play the game.
7059000	7066000	And you know, you can brake with the brake pedal in your car. You can't accelerate because it's already accelerating.
7066000	7069000	It's on this one game, Beach Buggy Racing 2.
7070000	7072000	But yeah, you can use your car.
7073000	7077000	We've all seen those videos of cars crashing into stores or whatever.
7078000	7082000	We've all seen those videos, and nobody wants that to be them in their Teslas.
7083000	7085000	That's why they don't let you use the gas pedal.
7086000	7091000	But there you go. Drive virtual car with real car.
7091000	7096000	I will say Bobby went in a little in depth on his show on this topic if you want to hear more.
7097000	7104000	Because I thought he made a very good point about how you with the turning of the wheel and the tires, you probably don't want to do a lot of that while you're parked.
7105000	7107000	So this is really a novelty like show off thing.
7108000	7110000	But this is not the way you're going to game long term.
7111000	7113000	Put your car on the lift first and then do it.
7114000	7116000	Yeah, put a car up on a lift first and then do it.
7117000	7122000	But you know what, so is that. Now I remember Bobby showed me this when I was visiting last.
7123000	7125000	The way that they do like Rainbow Road and so forth in there.
7126000	7128000	And it's one of those things, oh it's cute. You show it off to your friends.
7129000	7131000	Haha, that's funny. And then you don't really ever do it again.
7132000	7136000	Anyway, Bobby says I can play other games in my Tesla but not the new high end stuff.
7137000	7140000	I have some of the Atari games on mine like Asteroids and Centipede.
7141000	7142000	Yeah, that's pretty cool that they have the.
7143000	7145000	But it's interesting how Tesla wants to do all this gaming stuff.
7146000	7149000	Okay, for something that's supposed to be an aw that's cute moment.
7150000	7152000	It's like alright, this is, how long is this going to go?
7153000	7156000	But maybe, I don't know, maybe they, it is, I don't know about the turning the wheel in place.
7157000	7159000	But like you know if you can play with the touch pad, play classics and stuff.
7160000	7162000	It is something to do while the car is charging.
7163000	7166000	Because you know that may be something that you're not used to is waiting for the car to charge.
7167000	7168000	Which might take a little longer than fueling up.
7169000	7171000	But that's why they put those car chargers at shopping malls.
7171000	7176000	And you know, elaborate travel stops in places where it's very easy to kill a lot of time.
7177000	7179000	So, anyway. Alright, we'll move on.
7180000	7182000	Let's talk about world release dates.
7183000	7186000	Travel around the world and check out what is coming out in a store near you. Loki.
7187000	7191000	Alright, so this week we've got, looks like Heavy Rain coming out on PC.
7192000	7196000	Bloodstained Ritual of the Night, the Switch version is going to be coming up as well.
7196000	7201000	Devil May Cry on Nintendo Switch. Judgment on PlayStation 4.
7202000	7205000	Samurai Showdown on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
7206000	7210000	Super Netunia RPG on Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4.
7211000	7213000	MotoGP 19 on Nintendo Switch.
7214000	7217000	The Sinking City on PC, PlayStation 4, Xbox One.
7218000	7221000	F1 2019 on PC, PlayStation 4, Xbox One.
7222000	7225000	And last but not least, Super Mario Maker 2.
7226000	7228000	On the Switch. Awesome. Yep.
7229000	7231000	Excited about that, that's for sure. I can't wait to get that.
7232000	7235000	Alright, moving on and talking about what's coming out in Japan.
7236000	7240000	On Japan we have Samurai Showdown, is released on June 27th on the PlayStation 4.
7241000	7245000	A game called Kono Subarashi Sekai ni Suyukufuku.
7246000	7247000	This wonderful world something.
7248000	7253000	Is coming out. And then, Dark Tetsuya, La Mulana 2 gets its Japanese release this week.
7253000	7255000	I think that's already out here.
7256000	7258000	Or on the Switch or something.
7259000	7264000	And then that same Kono Subarashi game is coming out in a regular and limited edition.
7265000	7267000	Also a game called To All of Mankind.
7268000	7272000	I don't know if that sounds like a letter somebody writes before they do something terrible.
7273000	7275000	But it actually looks like it's based on anime.
7276000	7281000	The game called To All of Mankind is a bunch of anime girls walking across a crosswalk like they're the Beatles.
7281000	7285000	So I don't... Alright. That's that game.
7286000	7291000	Then looking at the Nintendo Switch this week. What do we have? Puyo Puyo Esports.
7292000	7296000	That's a thing? Competitive Puyo Puyo? Yeah, Puyo Puyo Esports.
7297000	7298000	Only 20 bucks.
7299000	7300000	Wow.
7301000	7303000	It looks like it might be a sports themed Puyo Puyo game.
7304000	7306000	That's what I'm getting from the screenshots. That's kinda cool.
7307000	7310000	Alright, other games coming out on the Switch in Japan this week.
7311000	7314000	No, that's it. Sorry. Oh no, I looked the wrong way.
7315000	7317000	La Mulana 2 is on the Switch this week as well.
7318000	7325000	And To All of Mankind also gets its release in Japan as well as Bloodstained on the Switch in Japan this week.
7326000	7328000	How about the UK, DarkSakura?
7329000	7330000	There's some stuff.
7331000	7334000	So we have Samurai Showdown on the 24th.
7335000	7339000	Also on the 24th, Car Mechanic Simulator, Monster Jam Steel Titans.
7339000	7348000	We have Kingdom Come Deliverance Royal Collectors Edition, Judgment, F1 2019 Legends Edition.
7349000	7354000	On the 26th, we have The Sinking City, MotoGP 19.
7355000	7368000	On the 27th, Death Gambit, Super Mario Maker 2, QUI VR, Hollow Knight, F1 2019 Anniversary Edition.
7369000	7372000	That's it. Awesome. Alright.
7373000	7376000	Should I go up through July because we won't be here, will we?
7377000	7384000	No, you won't be here next week. I think we are having a show next week. It'll probably be a short show.
7385000	7387000	Because I'll be coming back from Reno that morning.
7387000	7398000	So my birthday is next week. And as a present to myself, I bought some time ago VIP tickets, meaning I get to meet and greet.
7399000	7409000	And I'm so excited I could cry. Carly Rae Jepsen, or as we call her, as my people call her, Carly Slay Jeezipsen is playing at the Grand Sierra in Reno.
7410000	7414000	And so we have meet and greet tickets and I'm so excited. I'm like, I'm gonna cry. It's gonna be so much fun.
7414000	7418000	So, Loki, you look like you're about to make fun of me in a massive way. I don't even care.
7419000	7423000	I can't make fun of you because I have no idea what any of that you just said was.
7424000	7426000	Do you remember that song, Call Me Baby? That was her.
7427000	7434000	But if you all were to stream Emotion, which you absolutely should do, as well as her new album, you should stream all of Carly Rae Jepsen.
7435000	7439000	She's got a lot of great bops. That's what the kids say. A lot of bops.
7440000	7443000	Don't use anything that the kids would say anymore.
7444000	7445000	No one says that, Rob.
7446000	7449000	I will be coming back from seeing Carly Slay the night before.
7450000	7451000	I'm judging you so hard right now.
7452000	7453000	I don't give a fuck.
7454000	7455000	If you were going to see Britney, I would be...
7456000	7458000	What is wrong with Carly Rae Jepsen?
7459000	7461000	Nothing's wrong with her, but she's not Britney.
7464000	7465000	Anyway.
7466000	7467000	She is not Britney.
7468000	7472000	Thank you, Vid Power, who says, I attended a Carly Rae Jepsen concert once. She's great.
7472000	7475000	Thank you. Thank you. Alright.
7476000	7477000	She's not Britney.
7478000	7484000	Let's move on. Our mailbag. Every week you guys send us emails to participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
7485000	7486000	Is she iCarly?
7487000	7488000	Bobby Black Wolf. She is not iCarly.
7489000	7490000	I found iCarly toys at the thrift store and I cried.
7491000	7493000	Bobby Black Wolf says, she's Carly, bitch.
7496000	7499000	I did not expect Bobby Black Wolf of all people to make that joke.
7500000	7501000	Well played. Well played.
7502000	7504000	Thank you, DPO. Alright, moving on. Let's get to the mailbag.
7505000	7507000	Every week you guys send us emails. Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
7508000	7509000	And we read them.
7510000	7515000	Except sometimes your host in his advancing age and DarkSakura not being here misses one.
7516000	7517000	And I think that's what happened with this email.
7518000	7519000	Advanced age my ass.
7520000	7521000	DarkSakura is about to read.
7522000	7523000	I've done been there.
7524000	7527000	And this is from YYR. So yes, we did get the email.
7527000	7532000	It's just someone wasn't here and someone farted and someone...
7533000	7535000	I literally don't have a reason.
7536000	7538000	Rob is a shrug emoji.
7539000	7542000	Obviously I would not ignore or overlook his email.
7543000	7546000	Rob is shrug emoji right now. Shrug emoji.
7547000	7551000	So hello LR. Just a couple of thoughts on last week's pre-E3 and E3 coverage.
7552000	7555000	On the subject of Forza Horizon's four second expansion announcement,
7555000	7560000	Rob remarked that the Lego Speed expansion very well could have been made into its own game.
7561000	7564000	And that he felt the same about Forza Horizon's three Hot Wheels expansion.
7565000	7568000	There's an important distinction to be made here for a full game and a DLC expansion.
7569000	7575000	If these had been full games and you're a Game Pass subscriber, you'd be able to play them for no additional cost.
7576000	7580000	But because these are DLC expansions, they cost money to play and you don't get them for quote free.
7580000	7589000	And on top of this, if you decide to buy the DLC and let your Game Pass subscription expire, you may wind up owning DLC you can't use unless you turn around and buy the game.
7590000	7597000	So I think these are deliberate thought out moves and that they know exactly what they're doing by making these DLC and not full games.
7598000	7604000	It's a truly modern business model that seems extremely user friendly but under the surface is just a wee bit devious.
7605000	7606000	I still want a full game. I don't care.
7607000	7619000	Yeah, no. I definitely think there's some truth to what YYR is saying, especially in regards to they like to give you these games with the Game Passes because then they can still make a buck off DLC.
7620000	7622000	Sometimes they include the DLC in the past, most of the time they don't.
7623000	7628000	They still sell the games because with that argument, Xbox is just not publishing anymore games because they're just going to include them all in Game Pass.
7629000	7632000	They still sell the games because the Game Pass hasn't taken over yet.
7632000	7635000	So I mean, full game please.
7636000	7642000	Okay, but it's just like, we just want to see this idea as a full game.
7643000	7650000	But to be fair, Bobby played the DLC. I haven't yet. And when I was listening to his show, he said, I kind of get why it's not its own game.
7651000	7656000	But that doesn't mean we don't want to see the idea of a Lego Forza thing thought as realized.
7656000	7664000	Yeah, bigger. Obviously, yes, it's not going to be a full-fledged game in the DLC, but I would like a full-fledged game in the DLC.
7665000	7670000	Bobby says it is definitely a DLC, not a full-fledged game. It's just Forza Horizon 4 with the Lego skin.
7671000	7677000	I'm fine with that. I'm completely fine with that. I'm fine with also the Hot Wheels expansion as its own game.
7678000	7679000	Anyway, I'll get to it at this point, but moving on.
7680000	7684000	So now as far as Google Stadia, my question is, who is it for? What is their intended audience?
7684000	7690000	If you look at the launch lineup, it contains very few exclusives. Good use of a semi-colon there.
7691000	7694000	No, I love reading YYRs letters. They're beautiful.
7695000	7702000	Most of the announced games are either previously released AAA titles spanning the last few years or new AAA titles that are also releasing on established platforms.
7703000	7707000	In this way, the Stadia launch lineup looks suspiciously familiar to that of Wii U.
7707000	7713000	The timing of Stadia is questionable also. Completely ignoring the technology, let's get this fact straight.
7714000	7718000	Stadia is launching with games that can be played on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
7719000	7725000	If you want to play a AAA console game, you probably own one or both of these by now.
7726000	7731000	After all, you've had almost six years to buy them. So who exactly is rushing to throw money at Stadia?
7732000	7735000	The timing seems even more questionable when you consider this.
7736000	7746000	Microsoft and Sony are launching their new consoles next year to audiences that have built up financial investments and brand loyalty over many years with exclusive games that will never launch on Stadia.
7747000	7756000	So yeah, without even considering potential technical issues or Google's track record regarding the life of their services, I'm really confused as to who the intended audience of Stadia is.
7756000	7767000	I just know that I'm not a part of it. Thanks again for the show and have a great week. Warm, moist hugs, Aaron Yyr. Moist.
7768000	7769000	How do you feel about that word?
7770000	7771000	I don't care, but we have a friend who hates it.
7772000	7775000	I know some people are not fans of that, but anyway. Alright, well...
7776000	7777000	I have other words that I don't like.
7778000	7779000	Such as?
7780000	7785000	I hate being called hun. Hate it. Like, with an unholy passion. I'm like, just finish the word.
7786000	7787000	Oh, honey.
7788000	7789000	Oh, honey.
7790000	7796000	Alright. But anyway, Bobby in chat responds to that saying, the intended audience are people who don't want to buy a high-end PC.
7797000	7801000	People who don't want to buy a console since this runs on phones and Chromebooks.
7802000	7804000	And then Bobby, excuse me, Yyr kind of follows that up saying, at Bobby.
7805000	7808000	But if you don't want to buy a console, it's probably because you don't want to buy console games.
7809000	7814000	Bobby replies saying, I know many people who would love to play console games who don't want to spend money on a console and plug it into their TV.
7814000	7821000	I think you're kind of both right. Here's why. Bobby says it's for people who don't want to buy that stuff.
7822000	7824000	And yes, that's what Stadia is trying to do. It's consoles as a service.
7825000	7827000	It's trying to take the console, and I'm including high-end PC as a console here.
7828000	7830000	And it's trying to like basically instead sell that essentially as a service.
7831000	7835000	Although we know the low end of it will be free, but it is still a service, right?
7836000	7839000	But then Yyr said flat out in his email, I just know it's not for me.
7840000	7841000	And I think that can also be true.
7841000	7849000	And so, yeah, I'm still of the mindset that, and certainly I also recognize, well, Google Stadia definitely isn't for me.
7850000	7852000	Because I do buy the high-end PCs and the consoles and stuff like that.
7853000	7859000	But maybe there are people who would buy them on being able to stream something like Assassin's Creed to their phone.
7860000	7862000	I just don't think a phone is a fun way to play Assassin's Creed.
7863000	7869000	But we know that Apple just made a big to-do, and you probably already do this on Android about using Bluetooth controllers on their devices.
7869000	7876000	Yeah, I was thinking, you know, maybe like, you know, the draw is like smart TV owners.
7877000	7885000	Because I know with our TV that we got last year, you know, there's a lot of different apps that are built in and stuff.
7886000	7888000	So you could do like, you know, Hulu and Netflix and that kind of stuff.
7889000	7891000	And this is like another, oh hey, I can play games on this too.
7892000	7897000	The only thing with that though is with Stadia, you've got to have either a Bluetooth game controller,
7897000	7901000	or their preferred, you know, Stadia controller, which is like 100 bucks.
7902000	7905000	Or, I think, no, it's less than 100 bucks, but it's still expensive.
7906000	7908000	You know, it's not just like, I can play it out of the box type of thing.
7909000	7912000	So, I don't know. I don't know who it's for.
7913000	7917000	And I think really with the bandwidth caps that are in place now with most internet services,
7918000	7920000	it is going to be a hard sell for that.
7921000	7922000	Because it's like, well, why do I need to do this?
7922000	7930000	Maybe later on when like technology gets even better and, you know, they're able to stream games with better quality graphics and stuff like that,
7931000	7933000	there might be more of a value proposition there.
7934000	7936000	But right now, yeah, I don't know who it's for.
7937000	7943000	I think there might be something to say about people in other countries that may not have the easy access to consoles.
7944000	7945000	I know we talked about Brazil earlier randomly.
7946000	7951000	But of course, of course, now before you say it, Brazil is going to have to have the internet infrastructure to support it.
7952000	7953000	But I imagine some of their larger cities do.
7954000	7959000	But I'm just saying there might be places where it's not so easy to just get these consoles and higher parts because of import taxes and all this other stuff.
7960000	7962000	So, Stadia might actually be a more cost effective option.
7963000	7964000	If they have the internet.
7965000	7966000	But they're not even launching in those countries.
7967000	7969000	So, that's the other thing is it's not being launched there.
7970000	7971000	Yet.
7972000	7974000	Yet. I understand that. But, I don't know.
7975000	7978000	I just, I think there's just other ways that would be better.
7979000	7980000	Like PC gaming or...
7980000	7985000	I just, I just think, although, yes, it's certainly for a casual audience.
7986000	7996000	I think the reality is the bandwidth issues and concerns that come with that are going to really, like, once a casual kind of hears about how much of their internet is going to get eaten with it.
7997000	7998000	And that if they just play Stadia a lot, they can't really use Netflix or anything.
7999000	8000000	I think they'll kind of be turned off to it.
8001000	8006000	Yeah. I think once we see, we're going to have to see like what the actual numbers are as far as like how much data it's using in a given month.
8006000	8016000	You know, and I'm sure those articles are going to come out like once the services launch or like, you know, issues with running that while you're doing, you know, streaming on another thing.
8017000	8022000	Or what if, what if I want to play Stadia and someone else in my family wants to play Stadia at the same time?
8023000	8024000	And it's like, oh, can't do that.
8025000	8030000	Here's, and YYR is saying in chat, like I'm trying to follow the logic where someone might say this product is for me and I'm just not seeing it.
8031000	8033000	Let me give you one other example I could think of because I know I would have used it in this circumstance.
8033000	8043000	If I was a college kid who couldn't afford to get my own console because I'm trying to put myself through school, but I still want to be able to play video games on a Saturday night and I'm going to use my school internet.
8044000	8050000	And I would too, to play maybe the free version of Stadia and maybe have a couple of games on it or, you know, some of the free to play stuff.
8051000	8052000	Maybe I know I'm reaching a little.
8053000	8054000	But I think the audience will show itself.
8055000	8056000	Let's go with that. Okay. So I'm an average college kid.
8057000	8059000	I'm probably going to have a computer because I'm going to college.
8060000	8061000	Granted, it's not going to be the most powerful computer out there.
8061000	8065000	But it's something that should be able to play, you would say, most of the esports style.
8066000	8072000	So there's your Fortnite. There's your, you know, I don't know if that would play PUBG or whatever, but at least Fortnite, probably Overwatch.
8073000	8074000	You throw some Minecraft in there and stuff.
8075000	8080000	So you're still able to play some games and some basic games, maybe even on lower settings or whatever.
8081000	8090000	If you really want a console game, I mean, you probably have a console or if you don't have a console, you could get like a last gen console for very cheap and get the games for even cheaper.
8091000	8094000	There's lots of options out there.
8095000	8098000	And also if you're in college, you probably don't have a lot of time to be doing gaming and stuff.
8099000	8105000	But I just don't know where like college internet would not handle that crap at all.
8106000	8108000	I'm sorry. That's just not going to be a viable option.
8109000	8111000	But there's still lots of things out there.
8112000	8117000	And I get it that I think Google's thinking, well, hey, we can sell our Chromebooks.
8117000	8124000	And even though the specs on them kind of suck for everything other than just basic internet browsing, you can kind of game on them with this.
8125000	8133000	But it's kind of solving a problem that doesn't really need to be solved with a Chromebook because people that buy Chromebooks aren't buying them to game on anyways.
8134000	8138000	And no one's going to look at that and go, oh, now I can game on. I'm totally, but no, that's not going to happen.
8139000	8144000	So I don't know. I don't know who it's for and that's not really my problem to solve and it doesn't affect me in any way. So who cares?
8144000	8152000	All right. I will see. I still think some of this, like the bandwidth and stuff is just going to really be the killer issue.
8153000	8156000	But we'll see as this develops. Was there anything else to the email?
8157000	8158000	No, that was it.
8159000	8161000	All right. Well, thank you YYR and sorry it took us a week to get there.
8162000	8169000	All right. So let's invite more emails next time. Participate at orangeonshreddy.com. I promise I'll do better and not try to overlook them next time.
8169000	8174000	All right. Meanwhile, we have just a few more stories before we open up the Skype line for some calls.
8175000	8181000	We're running longer than I would have thought, especially not taking a break tonight. So it'll be short the time for calls tonight if you want to get in.
8182000	8183000	So be sure to be there in the green room. Loki.
8184000	8198000	So there was this game that was made out there, a fan game called Mario Royale, which was basically a 75 person death race through Mario's first few levels.
8199000	8203000	So you start off and everybody's kind of racing towards the finish and the first three that gets their wins.
8204000	8211000	It's kind of neat the way you can actually see all the different Mario's jumping around kind of reminded me a little bit of some of the other games that they have there.
8212000	8217000	There was like, God, I can't remember the racing game now, but there's several games out there that have like that kind of feature.
8218000	8221000	Of course, it got taken down or cease and desist by Nintendo.
8221000	8233000	Now it's under a different moniker now and they've made it very generic as far as the graphics and stuff go, but same type of gameplay.
8234000	8240000	It's a neat idea. This is something I could see them doing almost with like, you know, the whole Nintendo online stuff.
8241000	8247000	You know, kind of a race type game or something like that. I could see them definitely adapting something like that.
8247000	8255000	But right now, I mean, come on, you knew this shit was going to get taken down, but I guess we'll just have to...
8256000	8257000	Well, it's already on the internet though, so...
8258000	8262000	Well, no, it's already on the internet, but it had to be taken down. So now it's something else.
8263000	8267000	Somebody else will have it up in moments, I'm sure. Anyway.
8268000	8273000	But neat. I mean, I just, I don't know. I didn't get to play it when it was Mario.
8273000	8278000	But people are watching it on YouTube and stuff, or people have it on YouTube and stuff, right? So you can kind of see it in action?
8279000	8285000	Yeah. So at least you can watch it and you can dream of what might have been, I suppose.
8286000	8292000	Yeah. I mean, it looks like a neat idea and I still wish they would do something like that with Nintendo online.
8293000	8296000	Because they've got, you know, one game that they put out on it and they're...
8297000	8299000	Maybe that's why they shut it down, is that Mario...
8300000	8302000	No, I think it's because it was just infringing on their IP.
8303000	8309000	Not because it's like, oh, you took our idea, dammit! No, I think it's their IP.
8310000	8316000	Yeah, so they've got the version now without the Nintendo sprites in there.
8317000	8322000	And I want to say that, I don't know if the levels are still the same, but it looks very generic now.
8323000	8325000	But, I mean, I don't know. It's neat.
8325000	8334000	It's almost like that other game. I don't remember what it was called now, but it was the other Mario game where you could play as the non-Mario characters as well.
8335000	8342000	Like they had Metroid characters, they had Legends, all this stuff. There was Blaster Master in there.
8343000	8345000	I don't remember the hell that game was called, but it was...
8346000	8349000	And it was done here by a guy in SAC, too, because they went to Kickstarter with it, didn't they?
8350000	8353000	Yes, he went to Kickstarter for a generic version of it.
8353000	8355000	Like Super Mario crossover. Thank you, chatters.
8356000	8358000	Yeah, never got finished, unfortunately.
8359000	8365000	But yeah, then on the Kickstarter, it was like all the Marios and that were gone and replaced with just analogies.
8366000	8367000	Lookalikes.
8368000	8369000	B-movie knockoffs.
8370000	8372000	Oh, as Joe and her master, the Kickstarter failed. That's too bad.
8373000	8379000	It's hard on Kickstarter now, you guys, because there's been so many horror stories about people not getting their goods and stuff.
8380000	8382000	People really choose what they are and aren't going to back very carefully.
8383000	8389000	Yeah, I mean, I did that Amstream thing recently, but that's because they were already showing, basically, a finished product.
8390000	8397000	And they already said, we have these licenses, and this money is to kind of get us that push to get out the door or run in, basically.
8398000	8400000	And probably to sell some early subscriptions and stuff.
8401000	8404000	But that was why I backed it, was because they were pretty much already showing something that was finished.
8405000	8407000	That's the only way I would ever do a Kickstarter like that.
8408000	8410000	Yeah, and I think I have a finished product in mind.
8410000	8417000	Exactly. I think things that do things like that have a better chance of succeeding than, like, I have an idea.
8418000	8425000	Well, I mean, it's great that Bloodstained is doing so well, and especially, you know, Darkstalker is receiving it as well as she is, and hopefully I do too.
8426000	8428000	Because, like, I kickstarted that thing, like, four years ago, you know?
8429000	8430000	Yeah, that's the other thing.
8431000	8435000	But I am, no, at the end of the day, I'm happy that we get a game like it and that it seems to have been worth the wait.
8435000	8439000	Alright, anyway, let me get to this story, which is about Anthem.
8440000	8450000	That's right, EA, you know, some people would wonder why they haven't pulled the servers by now on Anthem, because usually that, I'm not saying that to, like, knock on Anthem, but that's just the EA thing to do, it seems, usually.
8451000	8461000	But EA did a big interview with Game Daily, Andrew Wilson, the CEO of EA, basically said that bringing two subsets of players to the game was an issue.
8461000	8467000	We brought together these two groups of players who were making this emotional value calculation on two different vectors.
8468000	8472000	One was traditional BioWare story-driven content, and the other was this action-adventure type content.
8473000	8477000	About the 30 or 40 hour mark, they really had to come together and start working in on the elder game.
8478000	8482000	At that point, everyone kind of went, oh, hang a minute, now the calculation is off.
8483000	8488000	It's off because I've got a friend who sits in this other category of player, they want to play the game a certain way, I want to play the game a certain way.
8488000	8491000	The promise was we can play together, and that's not working very well.
8492000	8500000	So he just kind of goes on to say that these two didn't mix or whatever, but he says, the world is compelling enough to continue investing in the game, basically.
8501000	8507000	Quote, the teams at BioWare will continue to come to work every day and listen to the players, old and new, and seek to deliver on the promises they've made to those players.
8508000	8509000	That's what you're seeing with Anthem today.
8509000	8520000	Here's the thing. A game can turn around. Diablo 3, excellent example. Final Fantasy XIV, wonderful example. No Man's Sky, fantastic recent example.
8521000	8526000	Anthem can be those things, and I would hope, I would love it if Anthem ends up one of those things.
8527000	8532000	Like, prove me fucking wrong, make this game great, right? I just don't fucking trust EA to do it.
8532000	8541000	But if there has been some epiphany at a higher level in a boardroom at EA somewhere, where somebody has decided to champion, Anthem is going to be our Diablo 3.
8542000	8550000	There's a little problem, though, so far with the way that they've approached that, because they have this roadmap of like, here's how we're going to fix the game, here's how we're going to put out more content for it,
8551000	8563000	and they have missed that roadmap completely so far, and I think even now they've removed the roadmap, or portions of the roadmap are missing now because of that.
8564000	8577000	So, it's not off to a good start, and trust in EA, of course, is at an all-time low, so I'm hesitant to believe just because this game and this game and this game could do it, that this game's going to do it.
8577000	8587000	I don't disagree, I'm trying to give a shred of the benefit of the doubt, but the realist of me, I think you're right.
8588000	8594000	And it's a bummer, but at the same time, EA's just made a lot of bad decisions.
8595000	8597000	And I just hope that Bioware doesn't have to pay for that.
8597000	8607000	I really hope that's true, too, but I think Dragon Age 4 is going to be the make or break thing for Bioware, and so I do hope it's great.
8608000	8616000	And I want to see Bioware, I love Bioware, they fucking made Mass Effect, it's a great game, and I wish they could have had another year on Mass Effect Andromeda, I really do.
8617000	8620000	In a perfect world, they would go back and actually finish Mass Effect Andromeda.
8621000	8623000	And that's where a lot of these problems come from.
8623000	8627000	That is why Anthem was never going to get any attention from me.
8628000	8639000	Yep, same. Alright, EA, I think, in my opinion, needs to show a little bit more of the, you know, we're viewing these things differently and we're going to make these changes, but I'm not holding my breath.
8640000	8648000	We'll see, though. In the meantime, how about something a little bit more of a developer who was with the big time and then ended up doing something a little more indie?
8648000	8653000	Well, Igarashi-san, who, I loved meeting him, he's such a rock star.
8654000	8663000	But anyway, he was asked about, you know, if there was going to be more bloodstained.
8664000	8669000	And so I'm going to read this quote, and this was before the game actually came out,
8669000	8678000	Since we're still kind of in development, I haven't thought about it that much, but if bloodstained does well, I'd be very happy, very willing to make a franchise and build upon it.
8679000	8681000	Right now, it's about getting the game out, though.
8682000	8686000	So, yeah, he said he would be happy and willing to give us more bloodstained.
8687000	8690000	To make it a thing. To make it its new Castlevania.
8691000	8694000	I can't believe you're already waiting for a sequel and some of us haven't played it yet.
8695000	8698000	Hopefully they're able to take some of the things they've done.
8699000	8704000	And really put that into a new game. That would be great. Don't you think?
8705000	8706000	I think so.
8707000	8708000	Yeah, I agree.
8709000	8713000	Alright, Loki, just a few more stories and then we're going to look to our Discord for some calls.
8714000	8717000	vognetwork.com slash Discord will get you into the Discord and you can go into the green room.
8718000	8722000	And it's great to have a little description of what you want to talk about in Channel Orange Lounge Radio. Loki.
8723000	8727000	So it's been a while since Grand Theft Auto 5 came out, but they're still making updates to Grand Theft Auto Online.
8727000	8731000	So the newest update is going to be this casino that they're adding.
8732000	8735000	So the casino has actually been there for a long time. It's been in the game since the beginning.
8736000	8739000	And it's just been kind of under construction the entire time.
8740000	8750000	The thought was that it was going to be this single player DLC that never ended up coming out because they kind of shifted away from the single player stuff into online.
8750000	8757000	In fact, I know that for a while they were actually seeing stuff about the casino even in development as all these different updates came.
8758000	8764000	People data mining stuff. But now they're finally going to release the full casino. It's going to be coming out later this summer.
8765000	8772000	As they've teased a little bit on Rockstar Games Twitter talking about this brand new casino.
8773000	8777000	It says luxury casino at the heart of Vinewood. Opening soon.
8777000	8785000	So yes, this is another game that's getting actual gambling mechanics now. It's not beating around the bush anymore.
8786000	8788000	It's actual slot machines and gambling.
8789000	8791000	I haven't played Grand Theft Auto Online in so long.
8792000	8799000	Which is weird because I love Grand Theft Auto and I have it on multiple platforms, but I have not played it in ages.
8800000	8802000	It's just such a grind fest.
8803000	8809000	Isn't it nice though to see the game get this support?
8810000	8815000	I just wish it was a single player DLC. I couldn't care less about the stupid online stuff.
8816000	8817000	You caught that one very well.
8818000	8819000	I know. I try not to.
8820000	8822000	One more story for you guys before we check out our Discord.
8823000	8825000	And that has to do with Cadence of Hyrule.
8826000	8831000	And I thought this was an appropriate note to end on tonight officially with our plug stories.
8832000	8837000	Cadence of Hyrule of course came out on the Switch recently. I still need to play it. It's on my list of things to play.
8838000	8839000	But this is really cool.
8840000	8845000	If you have a GameCube controller adapter for the Switch and you have your DDR Mario Mix dance mat.
8846000	8848000	Yep, you can play Cadence of Hyrule on a dance mat.
8849000	8851000	The menus are not going to be the best, but you can do it.
8851000	8858000	And it should be noted that Crypt of the Necrodancer, which obviously was kind of the predecessor for Cadence of Hyrule and where it came from,
8859000	8861000	has a dance pad mode on Steam, which is really cool.
8862000	8869000	So yeah, those of you that want to play DDR cross Cadence of Hyrule, you can do that now.
8870000	8872000	If you have all the right equipment, which is a pretty big if.
8873000	8877000	I mean, I don't know how many people still have those DDR Mario Mix dance pads, but that's still pretty cool.
8877000	8883000	Alright, well that's it for the stories that we had slated to talk about tonight.
8884000	8888000	Just have to throw it in my arcade cabinet at home and wire it up to my...
8889000	8890000	Yeah, right? You need to do that.
8891000	8892000	Dark Sakura, if you need to head out, let me know.
8893000	8895000	Yeah, because food.
8896000	8900000	The place closes at 9, so I'm going to go ahead and say goodnight to everybody.
8901000	8903000	So long and thanks for all the fish.
8904000	8905000	Thank you for 17 years, Dark Sakura.
8905000	8910000	Well, there'll be 17 more. I'll be decrepit and broken.
8911000	8912000	I'll be doing this in the old folks' home.
8913000	8915000	I know there's a part of me that wants to ask the question,
8916000	8918000	how much longer do you think we'll be doing this? But I think that's kind of a morbid thing to ask.
8919000	8923000	And honestly, I think if you'd asked us in, and I think I joked about this when we hit 777,
8924000	8926000	I'm almost positive I said early on in the first 100 episodes,
8927000	8929000	we're not going to still be doing this episode 777. Give me a break.
8930000	8934000	I actually want to contact the Guinness office.
8935000	8938000	And see if we can actually get a Guinness World Record.
8939000	8940000	You get on that.
8941000	8942000	I'm serious. Do it.
8943000	8944000	Why not?
8945000	8946000	Sure, they'll give Guinness World Records for everything.
8947000	8948000	If it's not us, at least we'll know, right?
8949000	8953000	But for longest running video game live broadcast.
8954000	8958000	Yeah, 17. I can't imagine somebody's got that. Who could?
8959000	8960000	So we'll see.
8961000	8962000	We outlasted GameProTV.
8962000	8965000	We've been here longer than Nick Arcade.
8966000	8968000	Alright, we're going to get to some calls, alright?
8969000	8970000	Thank you, Dark Saga, for being here.
8971000	8973000	We'll see you in two weeks, because you're not here next week, right?
8974000	8975000	Yeah, next week is San Francisco Pride, but hey!
8976000	8977000	Happy Pride.
8978000	8979000	If you're in San Francisco for Pride, come find the sisters and come find me.
8980000	8982000	That'll be fun. That's going to be a lot of people, but that'll be fun.
8983000	8985000	Don't overheat. Hopefully the weather's nice.
8986000	8988000	Alright, moving on. Let's get to some calls.
8989000	8991000	We're going to get right to it. Hi, you're on Orange Large Radio. Who's this?
8992000	8993000	It's Brad.
8994000	8998000	Hello, you're on Orange Large Radio. If you can hear me, say hello.
8999000	9000000	Hello?
9001000	9002000	He's very quiet.
9003000	9005000	Hello, you're there, but you're very quiet on my end, but that might just be on my end.
9006000	9007000	Go ahead, sir. Who is this?
9008000	9009000	It's Brad from Pod Culture.
9010000	9012000	Hello, Brad from Pod Culture. What's on your mind tonight?
9013000	9018000	Oh, not a whole lot other than I picked up a toy.
9018000	9028000	I'm sorry, could you say that again? Because it was cutting out a little bit while Jamie was packing up stuff, and my TV volume was taking a minute to turn up.
9029000	9033000	I picked up a cheap toy at Best Buy.
9034000	9038000	You know what, buddy? It's cutting in and out, so I might have to go ahead and...
9039000	9041000	I can't hear you guys. I don't know if you can, but I'm going to...
9042000	9043000	I'm picking up a squeaky toy.
9043000	9050000	Yeah, I'm going to try somebody else and see if it works or if it's on our end, but type it in chat, and I'll try to relay it.
9051000	9052000	Okay, sorry, buddy.
9053000	9054000	All right, let's try to go to the next call.
9055000	9056000	Hi, you're on Orange Large Radio. Who's this?
9057000	9060000	Hello, this is SSJ Linger Matt. Can you guys hear me?
9061000	9065000	Yes, you're coming through great. In fact, you're probably echoing back through because I have you so loud now.
9066000	9068000	Okay, sorry, buddy. What's on your mind?
9069000	9076000	I wanted to call in and talk about this whole EA loot box thing that they talked about.
9077000	9078000	Go for it, sir.
9079000	9093000	I'm a big sports gamer. I play a lot of the NHL games, and I think EA is just really...
9094000	9098000	They really just want to die on this hill with the loot box stuff.
9099000	9105000	They want to die on the loot box hill. Elaborate on that, please. Why did they want to die on the loot box hill?
9106000	9117000	Because these loot boxes that they use, and I would say in the sports games that they have, FIFA primarily brings in so much revenue.
9117000	9131000	They bring in far more revenue than the game itself ever brings in with the Ultimate Team aspect of the game.
9132000	9143000	For those not familiar with Ultimate Team, you basically draw cards to build your own team.
9144000	9152000	Obviously, the better the cards are, the better the players that you have. There's the gold and diamond levels of cards.
9153000	9159000	The more likely you'll be able to win games, so it's very much pay-to-win.
9159000	9171000	You can incur points to buy packs, but in reality, it's a very slow build.
9172000	9179000	You really just have to spend money to get these really good players in order to win more consistently.
9180000	9183000	It's so frustrating when you have to spend $60 for the game in the first place.
9184000	9188000	At least if the game is free, you are able to chalk it up to, well, that's how they make their money, through this system.
9189000	9194000	I think what really infuriates people is when they pay $60 for the game up front and then get this added on top of it.
9195000	9200000	There's a similar kind of, like, it's not really loot boxes per se, but there was a similar thing that comes to mind.
9201000	9206000	It didn't make tonight's show roll, but there's a lot of gamers that are upset about the NBA 2K 18-19.
9207000	9210000	One of those just really went on a deep sale for like three bucks.
9211000	9212000	Oh, it was 19.
9213000	9217000	What the game's doing now is that there's advertisements you have to sit through and watch.
9217000	9221000	Which, if you only paid $3 for a game, okay, maybe that's a little bit understandable.
9222000	9224000	But that's happening to the people that paid $60 to support it when it first came out, too.
9225000	9230000	But on top of that, though, so what? You don't have to charge $3 for the game.
9231000	9235000	Make it a different, like, this is an advertised supported game or something.
9236000	9237000	Within the resources.
9238000	9245000	So anyway, not to deviate too much from the point you're trying to make, but I feel like the industry as a whole is very much like, how can we double dip this?
9245000	9253000	And I think that's what happened in the case of NBA 2K 19 was, okay, it's not loot boxes, but it was, okay, this game isn't selling anymore.
9254000	9257000	We know we have a few more months until NBA 2K 10 comes out.
9258000	9262000	How are we gonna, how do we make money off people still in these few months that are left?
9263000	9265000	Oh, let's sell them and then get them on the ads.
9266000	9268000	You know, there's a way to kind of make money there.
9268000	9275000	And I think, you know, in some ways the loot boxes was, you know, how can we, you know, make more than $60 off a game?
9276000	9285000	Yep. And, and I fear like, recently, they just announced the new, the new version of NHL 20.
9286000	9290000	And they kind of just, they've revealed some of like the new features in it.
9290000	9300000	A lot of fans are not happy with the game, but a lot of the stuff that they're kind of doing is kind of still gearing a lot more towards the loot box stuff.
9301000	9312000	I'll post an article in the Discord after my call, but Game Informer went, wrote up this really big article about all the new features in it.
9312000	9319000	And one of the features is that they've changed how the drawing of the Ultimate Team packs are.
9320000	9328000	They made a more elaborate, more dazzling, more like visually appealing for when you get like a really good player.
9329000	9339000	So, cause they said that they really want to target the streamers and the people posting their videos of them opening packs on YouTube.
9339000	9347000	Hmm. So to me, that kind of just like reminds me, and Rob, you kind of know this a little bit more cause I know you've gone to Reno and all that,
9348000	9355000	but it's like going to one of those fancy slot machines with the nice lights and the, and you know, the game characters on it.
9356000	9368000	It's just like really, they're really just really pushing this really hard and just like trying to like make it as visually appealing so someone could like get addicted to just like the, the gratification portion.
9369000	9374000	It's, it's so funny cause I thought you were about to make the example, film the slot machine and then put that on YouTube.
9375000	9386000	And I'm like, I, I've, I've heard of people that do that and they make, I know somebody that went to like a convention in Vegas for one of those YouTubers that, that does like slot machine YouTubes and does very, very well at it and has like a great community and stuff.
9387000	9389000	It's just, it's so interesting to me. But anyway.
9389000	9414000	Yeah, no, there's like, there's YouTubers that just, they open up like a hundred dollars worth of card packs and post it on YouTube and they get so many views and it's like, it's just like people are, people, you know, they say this in, you know, like the NHL Red and all that, that, you know, they want that kind of moment where they can get like that Mario Lemieux, like legendary players.
9414000	9425000	Right. And it's like people spend so much money. I got what I wanted. Yeah. All right. Well, my friend, I'm going to let you go so we can squeeze in another call, but thank you so much for calling in tonight. I really appreciate it.
9426000	9435000	Nope. It's, it's always good to have you like give that perspective from the sports games. Cause you kind of know that's like our weak area here in studio. We don't always play the yearly, you know, NHLs and MBAs and so forth.
9436000	9445000	We try to follow it and kind of like keep an eye on what's going on there, but I love to hear from the people who are like really in there playing them and kind of affected by, you know, some of these crappy loot box things. So thank you.
9446000	9461000	Yeah. And this like quick little anecdote about sports games, you know, like sports games are just like anything, like any other game, you know, sports games are just like, you know, an RPG, there's strategy and everything involved. So we're all game. We're all gamers. We all, it's all games.
9461000	9472000	So that's right. Then there would have been a time in a day when I would have said like, ah, fuck sports games. Fuck those, you know, but now I'm like, nope, they exist for a very distinct reason. There's people that are very into them and play them. I respect them.
9473000	9481000	I just don't go in that space very often, but I think it's, you know, I'm glad it exists cause it brings more gamers into the picture. So, all right, cool. All right.
9482000	9488000	All right. Bye. Let's try to squeeze in one more call here before we call it a night higher on orange launch radio. Who's this?
9489000	9492000	Hey, this is act deaf. Hey, act deaf. What's on your mind, buddy?
9493000	9498000	Well, I can talk about so many things right now, but I want to focus on Google Stadia.
9499000	9500000	Yeah, please.
9501000	9510000	Well, as you have may said already, and it has been said already, uh, there are so many things with Stadia that won't work at all.
9511000	9528000	Uh, I'm not, I kind of try not being so negative about it, but it looks so good on paper, but the execution, it will probably be so really, really bad in so many aspects, especially in the infrastructure thing.
9528000	9542000	Because even in the U S that probably has way better speeds than many other places in the world, it's still going to be so it's such a hassle, especially with the bandwidth caps.
9543000	9550000	But like, for example, in Mexico, we don't have the bandwidth caps, uh, at least for, uh, like comb internet.
9550000	9557000	But even then we don't have, at least not many people have the speed to handle something like Stadia.
9558000	9567000	To be, to be fair. I mean, you're right. There's a lot of big cities in the U S who do have that speed, but there are places in remote Alaska, Montana, Wyoming, Colorado.
9568000	9575000	There are places where people live in those places that even in California, there's rural parts to say, everybody always thinks about, you know, the beach and Hollywood and all that stuff.
9575000	9581000	But out in the redlands, out on the coast, you can't get cell signal for shit out there. And the internet's not great either.
9582000	9595000	So, um, you know, there's a lot of places in the U S that, uh, that face a lot of the same issues too. Not to, not to poopoo the points you're bringing up, but you know, uh, I think Google has to realize that they're launching something that's really only going to be usable in big cities.
9596000	9611000	So the big internet infrastructure, at least for now, I really wish Google wouldn't have given up on the problem of trying to get internet in more places around the country and, and so on the worldwide, um, because it feels like they've given up on everything else, which is just irritating. It's a whole nother issue.
9612000	9634000	Yeah. It's kind of frustrating that they give, they gave up on Google fiber. I would have loved to seen that like in many other places, especially outside of the U S because again, the internet here is not necessarily like really, really bad, but, uh, not many people have access to a good internet connection.
9634000	9654000	And it's, and it's kinda something that if Google wants to, a stadium to work, uh, they need to work on that and not necessarily to bring, uh, a complete experience if, if we can say that because yeah, gaming 4k 60 frames per second and all that stuff.
9655000	9674000	None of the 30 old people want that, but they just want to play. So they need to focus more on delivering the game service in a stable way, rather than making it like sound, Oh, we, you need all this. We need to, to push forward the graphics and how their game probably runs.
9674000	9702000	If it's, if it's stable, if it runs even like a 30 FPS, it's going to be great, but it's still the thing with the bandwidth, the thing with the connections, uh, the, the velocity you need to have. It's like, not necessarily anyone, uh, is has access to that. It's like, probably kind of unnecessary. It's good that there's an option, but not necessarily something that many people want. So yeah.
9704000	9717000	Uh, absolutely. Um, what else was I wanting to say with this, with the whole, Oh, I was going to ask your opinion on, because I kind of feel like at the same time we, and we sometimes forget Microsoft is kind of doing the same thing.
9717000	9728000	Google is not, not note for note, because obviously Microsoft isn't planning this launch of a separate thing. We know it's something they're going to build into probably windows and, and, uh, and Xbox consoles and so forth.
9728000	9742000	But I can't help, but feel like Microsoft is kind of waiting a little bit and maybe they're implementing things a little slower to see how it's received. And then they might go for something full throttle that kind of goes with Stadia.
9742000	9751000	I don't know. Have you been like paying attention to what Microsoft's doing? Do you have any opinion on their approach to, uh, uh, games delivering with the X cloud?
9752000	9779000	Uh, I haven't seen that much, but from the looks of it, it looks like it's going to be, uh, a better service in terms of infrastructure. Although I, I, I'm still like on the fence about it because if, if like you need a, uh, an Xbox console, or if you need, uh, something in particular to run X cloud, it's not going to be that great either.
9779000	9801000	But I'm kind of looking forward to it because at least, I don't know, with Microsoft and what they're doing with game pass, it seems like a good option at least, but I need to like really, really to, uh, for Microsoft to show more and explain more about X cloud before, uh, making a decision or making a judgment on it.
9801000	9811000	I kind of think though, like what they're doing and the reason why they have it, I think that's kind of what they're doing. I think they are purposely being a little bit more of a Ninja about this and Bobby points out X cloud already runs on Android phones.
9811000	9822000	I think they are, but into, and they're, they're trying to kind of stealth test this and do this a little bit without shouting it from the hilltops. You know, we've got this stream and come on board, do this.
9822000	9831000	I think they're just kind of like slowly putting it out there to kind of see how it takes and who's using it to kind of like better, like educate themselves to know then. Okay.
9831000	9840000	When we do want to take this to the next level and launch X cloud akin to what Google's doing with Stadia, they'll kind of know a little bit more and they'll have the proof behind it.
9840000	9850000	Like we've already been doing this for years and this is what our people say. That's just kind of the impression I'm getting from Microsoft, you know, and I don't, I don't want to come off like a Microsoft fan boy, but again, the reality is, you know,
9850000	9857000	I know so many people that have kind of cut Microsoft out B and they made that decision when, you know, the Xbox one launch was a disaster.
9857000	9869000	And so they went with, you know, the switch and the PlayStation four and that's fine, but I just think, especially where Microsoft's head is at now and how they're functioning as an organization and how Phil Spencer, you know, I'm just like, Ooh, I'm so like,
9869000	9880000	Microsoft is more fascinating to me in some ways than almost anybody else right now, because I'm like, how are they stacking the deck? What are they doing? What, you know, it's like trying to read somebody's poker hand.
9880000	9885000	It'll be interesting next year to see what's unveiled. So we'll have to see.
9885000	9891000	Yeah, we'll see. Anyway, act up. I got to let you go. So we wrap up the show, but thank you so much as always for your call. I appreciate it.
9891000	9893000	Hey, thanks for having me.
9893000	9899000	No problem. Take care, buddy. All right. And I think that is going to do it tonight. I'm sorry to anybody that didn't get through.
9899000	9908000	But, you know, you can always send us an email, participate at orangelaunchradio.com or however else you'd like to contact the show. Twitter is a great place too.
9908000	9918000	We'll read Facebook posts. We don't always interact there very well. I always get harassed from Facebook. People would like to hear from Orange Launch Radio and I'm like, all right, tune in Sunday night.
9918000	9925000	We're not the best social media managers. I wish I wish we had somebody that would like take on an internship.
9925000	9932000	But at the same time, I want to pay people for their talents, but we don't have a lot of money either. So, yeah, I don't know what to do with that anyway.
9932000	9936000	But that's that's a different issue. Last minute stories, Loki.
9936000	9943000	Yes. So there's an interesting rumor. We've been hearing stuff about how there's possibly going to be a switch mini or something like that.
9943000	9946000	And there hasn't really been much information from that.
9946000	9956000	Well, apparently there is this Chinese company, Hino-san or something like that, that has a clear protective case for a Nintendo Switch Mini.
9956000	9962000	And it also includes a, you know, looks like a visualization of what it would look like.
9962000	9968000	And they have this developed and they're selling it. So is it a thing that's going to be coming out?
9968000	9971000	Maybe. It looks like it's based. I reference this a little bit earlier.
9971000	9977000	Yeah. So who knows? That's interesting, I guess. I guess we'll find out probably pretty soon.
9977000	9985000	And then what else? I was going to say that, you know, we were talking about Stadia earlier.
9985000	9993000	So one of the things about Stadia is we found out that Destiny 2, since that's going to be a title that's on Stadia, not cross platform or PC.
9993000	9997000	So you're not going to play with PC players on that. It's going to be separate.
9997000	10002000	It's odd. Yeah. All right.
10002000	10013000	So that's it. And then real quick, then there was a streamer who's raised one million dollars for charity in four hours.
10013000	10015000	So that's pretty awesome.
10016000	10030000	I guess it was they're saying that this Ben, Dr. Lupo, who is playing Fortnite and nine hundred twenty thousand dollars was donated during that time.
10030000	10036000	For what? Doing a charity? Yeah. During Fortnite stream. No. What do we know? The charity. Oh, the charity St. Jude's.
10036000	10045000	Oh, OK. Very worthy. That's great. Pretty cool. Yeah. I've seen St. Jude's do like reach out to gamers to do streaming things.
10045000	10052000	This is not uncommon for nonprofits to put themselves out there to entice people to do charity thons because, you know, hey, there they need to raise money.
10052000	10056000	And so gaming marathons are one way to do it. Apparently your life does this, too.
10056000	10062000	Apparently, during the whole Guardian Con charity stream, they had raised their hope of the race three million dollars and the raising three point seven million.
10062000	10070000	So, wow. That's very cool. All right. Well, that's going to about wrap it up for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
10070000	10076000	Hey, thank you so much for tuning into this show and supporting us over the past 17 years and beyond.
10076000	10082000	And I don't think we're running out of fuel yet. So we're going to keep this show going a good long time.
10082000	10086000	And thank you guys, of course, for tuning in and your support. We really appreciate you guys being here.
10086000	10089000	If you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Lounge Radio, help us spread the word.
10089000	10095000	A nice word of mouth spreading, telling a friend or two. That goes a long way.
10095000	10098000	A nice five star review on iTunes also goes a very long way.
10098000	10106000	The auto hosts on Twitch are like super great and really help out, especially with the word of mouth.
10106000	10111000	Yeah. Yeah. Word of mouth and all that. Bobby in chat says RIP. Hangouts on air.
10111000	10115000	Oh, yeah. We didn't get to that. Google. Speaking of things, Google's killing hangouts on air. They're going to kill.
10115000	10119000	I can't believe that. So many. I mean, they're probably just not making money off it and that's why it's got to go.
10119000	10124000	But I just so many people I know use that. That's that's going to be detrimental.
10124000	10129000	I'm sure alternatives will pop up, though. But anyway, thank you guys for being here on Twitch and supporting us.
10129000	10134000	Really appreciate it. Let's go around and get everybody's final thought. Loki, your final thought.
10134000	10139000	My final thought is I'm hoping to work more on my game this week and maybe I'll play something.
10139000	10145000	Who knows? I don't know what the way my schedule has been. Maybe not, but we'll see.
10145000	10151000	And my final thought is I have to go to the restroom because I've drank this thing full of water.
10151000	10156000	So we are ending the show right now. Have a great night, everybody.
10156000	10159000	We'll see you next time here at Orange Lounge Radio. Good night.
