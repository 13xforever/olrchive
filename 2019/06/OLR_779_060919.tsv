7000	14000	With your hosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
14000	17000	It's the annual Obvious Headline, E3 is upon us!
17000	21000	Hopefully next year I won't have to intro how teased we still are about the forthcoming 9th console generation.
21000	28000	This is the week's most obvious headline, stay tuned for the rest of the week's gaming news starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.
28000	33000	Orange Lounge Radio
33000	40000	Loki, it's happening! It's happening! Loki, I can't believe it, it's fucking happening!
40000	46000	Phantasy Star Online 2 in the west, finally! Finally, Loki, finally!
46000	52000	Do you know how many years? How many years have you been waiting for Phantasy Star Online 2?
52000	53000	Several, yes.
53000	58000	Hi! Welcome everybody! It's another week of Orange Lounge Radio, happy E3!
58000	65000	It's a show where every gamer has a voice and we talk, of course, for 3 hours every week about video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
65000	74000	My name is the very excited Rob Roberts to cover what would be, what, like our 16th year of E3 shenanigans and probably a game I've been waiting for 16 years to talk about.
74000	79000	I am, of course, Rob Roberts and with me, as always, is Techmaster Loki.
79000	80000	Hello.
80000	89000	And not joining us tonight, Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers. She has the night off, she has a conflict tonight with her sister's organization.
89000	93000	She's doing the Pride event in Sacramento with the sister group today.
93000	96000	But, of course, she sends her love and all that.
96000	101000	And, you know, for her, Animal Crossing is going to be covered on next week's show anyway.
101000	107000	So tonight is going to be about some of the things we've seen thus far from Microsoft and all that good stuff.
107000	117000	So, anyway. Alright. Let's get into it. I mean, it's E3. E3's back and we've covered a lot of stuff already.
117000	120000	You're actually kind of keeping an eye on Bethesda's stuff as we're going, right?
120000	121000	Yeah.
121000	123000	There's a lot of fluff, I guess, going on.
123000	132000	It's been, like, you know, they just for the last 10 minutes or so have been showing off mobile games, which no one gives a shit about.
132000	136000	And then now they're showing off some stuff for Rage 2, which, yeah, that's cool.
136000	141000	Yeah, that's cool. Alright. Well, we'll cover all the bullet points on Bethesda a little bit later, but let's get into.
141000	144000	Did you have a chance to watch Microsoft's event?
144000	149000	And, you know, I kind of would imagine it's kind of the tentpole event for a lot of people today.
149000	150000	Did you have a chance to look at it?
150000	152000	I did watch it, yes. I watched the whole thing.
152000	153000	Yeah?
153000	156000	And it was pretty good. They had lots of game announcements.
156000	159000	Lots of other, like, they talked about their new console.
159000	168000	They talked about that Games Pass, you know, on PC now and, you know, the new Game Pass Ultimate stuff, which is pretty awesome.
168000	170000	So lots of games.
170000	174000	Yeah, definitely the message overall for Microsoft was games, games, games, games.
174000	176000	And I think that's a very good thing.
176000	186000	You know, most people that I talk to that tend to be, like, anti-Microsoft or whatever, or I wouldn't say, like, anti-Microsoft, but maybe, like, just doesn't support Xbox or doesn't own an Xbox One.
186000	192000	A lot of people are like, eh, they just don't really have the games. Or, you know, the games I want are on PlayStation or Nintendo Switch is more for me.
192000	193000	Yeah.
193000	199000	You know, I'm not sure. Well, I'm not sure. I find it also kind of matters what type of games you're into.
199000	205000	And I'm not sure that maybe we saw a lot at Microsoft's events today that was going to change anybody's mind on that.
205000	207000	That is a little bit of everything.
207000	212000	There was some peppering of stuff, like the Tales of games as far as RPGs go and things like that.
212000	213000	Yeah.
213000	215000	You know, I think there were a few things.
215000	221000	But I don't know if anybody's mind, especially just judging off, like, Twitter reactions and so forth, I don't know if anybody's mind was changed on Microsoft.
221000	225000	But I don't think that means to say that Microsoft did a bad job. I don't think they did by any means.
225000	233000	And I don't really know what needs a change with Microsoft since most of their games, like, I think everybody has a PC, so most of those games are going to be playable on PC anyways.
233000	234000	Right. Right.
234000	235000	So, yeah.
235000	237000	I'm going to go down the list.
237000	238000	I made a big old list of stuff.
239000	244000	So, obviously, I don't want to talk at length about necessarily everything, but certainly, I mean, there's a lot to talk about.
244000	248000	So, it all started off with a game called Outer Worlds that looked very Fallout-y to me.
248000	249000	I know we've kind of heard of this game before.
249000	251000	Yeah, that was last year, too, they talked about it.
251000	252000	But we'll see it in motion a little more.
252000	253000	Yeah.
253000	256000	Right? And so, it looks a little Fallout-y to me, which I think some of the developers...
256000	258000	It's the original developers of Fallout, like, New Vegas.
258000	260000	But, like, in space, which is cool.
260000	261000	Yeah.
261000	262000	Yeah. So, I was kind of into it.
262000	263000	Yeah, it looks good.
263000	264000	Yeah, I want to get it.
264000	265000	Look kind of neat.
266000	271000	It's a 4v4 that looks kind of like Overwatch, like, especially like the...
271000	272000	A melee Overwatch, I guess?
272000	273000	Yeah, like a melee Overwatch.
273000	274000	Like, the character designs.
274000	280000	Kind of what made me think of Overwatch is that it's trying to do these very strong kind of character designs, which I'm standing, Buttercup.
280000	281000	Thank you very much.
281000	283000	But, otherwise, you know, I kind of...
283000	289000	As is the case with a lot of these game announcements and game previews and trailers and things like this,
289000	293000	it doesn't always necessarily, like, show the actual game in motion.
293000	295000	And that's what I really want to see.
295000	297000	Like, what does it look like when you play it?
297000	298000	But it looked kind of neat.
298000	300000	I'm, you know, kind of interested.
300000	302000	So, let's see.
302000	304000	Ori and the Whisper Wards?
304000	305000	Whispering Woods?
305000	306000	Whispering Woods?
306000	307000	Whispering Woods.
307000	308000	The new Ori game.
308000	309000	And that looked...
309000	311000	I mean, the last Ori game is great.
311000	314000	It's kind of like a Metroidvania, if you're not sure where those games are.
314000	316000	But, like, the art style is really phenomenal.
316000	318000	Like, obviously, it has that look to it.
318000	322000	And I like that they kind of showed a lot of different boss characters and these different types of varied environments that just...
322000	324000	They look like paintings in motion.
324000	325000	It's really, really nice.
325000	327000	I'm sure that game is going to do very well for them.
327000	331000	And then, they started to show from the developers of Minecraft.
331000	336000	And I was like, is this finally the Minecraft 2 that I've been screaming about every year?
336000	341000	They had already shown this at, like, I think the Minecon thing.
341000	343000	They showed this off.
343000	345000	So, this wasn't necessarily a new thing.
345000	347000	But it's like, you know, it's your Minecraft Diablo game.
347000	349000	Which, I'm here for it, TBH.
349000	354000	Because when we get to our gaming weeks, I've been playing a lot of Diablo this week.
354000	358000	And that game is almost as old as Phantasy Star Online 2 in Japan.
358000	360000	And here I am still playing it.
360000	364000	But I like the idea of combining it in the Minecraft world.
364000	368000	By the way, speaking of, like, different platforms and things of that nature.
368000	375000	I don't know if you noticed, but at the same time that Microsoft was showing off the Minecraft Dungeons trailer.
375000	379000	Nintendo Switch posted it to their official Facebook page.
379000	381000	They posted that same trailer.
381000	384000	So, basically confirming that Minecraft Dungeons will also be on Nintendo Switch.
384000	386000	Even though it's a Minecraft game.
386000	389000	Even though it's a Microsoft game.
389000	392000	But, of course, Minecraft was on all those platforms anyway, right?
392000	395000	Well, you know, Steve is totally going to be announced for Smash tomorrow.
395000	396000	So, it's fine.
396000	399000	Or, when's Nintendo? Is that on Tuesday?
399000	400000	It might be Tuesday.
400000	403000	You know, Miyamoto was actually at Microsoft's press conference.
403000	407000	A lot of people were talking, oh my god, Miyamoto's sited there.
407000	409000	This Nintendo's in bed with Microsoft.
409000	411000	Phantasy's about to come true.
411000	417000	And it turns out, no, it's just actually kind of customary that the competition gets invited to all the pressers.
417000	423000	I want to say, when we went to the Sony event one year, we spotted the guys that were with Microsoft at the time in attendance.
423000	425000	Like, it happens.
425000	428000	It's a nicety. It's a formality.
428000	431000	The gaming industry is not that big.
431000	434000	A lot of these people tend to go from one company to the other.
434000	438000	Hell, look at Phil, not to get too ahead of myself, but look at Phil Harrison with the Google Stadia stuff.
438000	440000	Where did that guy used to be?
440000	441000	Microsoft, right?
441000	443000	So, you know, these guys will go around the industry.
443000	446000	So, they all still treat each other very nicely.
446000	449000	So, let's see.
449000	453000	Interesting comment from Bobby Black Wolf as we do tape live.
453000	457000	Of course, we tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern at our Twitch channel.
458000	460000	twitch.tv slash vog network.
460000	462000	And we are right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.
462000	464000	And Bobby himself is in chat right now saying,
464000	467000	the gaming companies don't hate each other as much as their fans do.
467000	471000	That's a very, that's what we say, tea.
471000	472000	Tea.
472000	473000	That's very much tea.
473000	475000	That's a hot piping cup of tea.
475000	476000	Alright, anyway.
476000	477000	Let's see.
477000	480000	The next bit they showed was Jedi Fallen Order, which was...
480000	481000	Yeah, that looked pretty good.
481000	486000	Had already been touched on at the EA Play event, but it looked really cool in motion.
486000	490000	I don't necessarily always get into those Star Wars games, but that one looked like...
490000	494000	Well, and the other thing is Respawn for a moment.
494000	497000	If we can talk about Respawn, they're really killing it for EA right now.
497000	501000	Between like Apex and I know a lot of people slept on Titanfall,
501000	505000	but I think now people are thinking, oh, I should have maybe go back and appreciate Titanfall.
505000	508000	Like Respawn's doing a lot of great stuff for EA right now.
508000	511000	And this appears to be another one that may do very well.
511000	518000	As long as this doesn't screw up the loot box thing like the last Star Wars game from another studio.
518000	521000	But I think EA's learned their lesson a little bit.
521000	522000	A little bit.
522000	524000	I'm not going to say they've completely turned around.
524000	527000	They're certainly not going to make that same mistake again, that's for sure.
527000	529000	Let's see.
529000	531000	We also, after that, had a game...
531000	532000	Oh, this?
532000	537000	Okay, so the next trailer comes up and it's a forest and the guy's got a flashlight and I'm like,
537000	541000	oh my fucking god, is this a new Alan Wake game because I'm about to lose my shit.
541000	546000	But then the trailer gets a little intense for what I think Alan Wake would usually be.
546000	548000	So I'm like, okay, I don't think this is actually Alan Wake.
548000	553000	And it turns out it's a setup for a Blair Witch game,
553000	558000	which looks like it's not like, you know, they're not going to make a video game based on a movie from 20...
558000	561000	It would literally be 20 years ago at this point, my god.
561000	566000	Because actually I think that movie had a video game on like PS1 or PC or something.
566000	570000	But I think it's just the myth.
570000	575000	But then again, they have like, you know, Friday the 13th game.
575000	582000	And they also have other like, you know, serial killer games or, you know, movie horror mascot games.
582000	583000	No, super good point.
583000	584000	Dead by Daylight.
584000	586000	Yeah, Dead by Daylight brings back like all the greatest hits in that game.
586000	590000	So like, you know, horror movies tend to get revisited in gaming.
590000	592000	That's not a new concept.
592000	596000	But I think with Friday the 13th, you know, that was more like an arena type of game.
596000	597000	You know, it's...
597000	600000	This is more like atmospheric, more like slender type stuff.
600000	601000	Plot thing going on.
601000	602000	Yeah.
602000	605000	We were actually doing a live chat at a VoG network on Twitch.
605000	610000	So we like hosted the stream that had like our own chat room that you could actually read the comments as opposed to going like this.
610000	612000	Like the official chats do with all the emotes and everything.
612000	614000	With all the emotes for clowns.
614000	616000	Which I see you're watching Bethesda.
616000	618000	And all I can see in that chat over there is emotes.
618000	620000	Clowns, it's clowns.
620000	621000	Clowns everywhere.
621000	622000	Clowns everywhere.
622000	627000	But we were watching it on our own channel and I saw people going, is it Silent Hill?
627000	629000	Like what is this going on here?
629000	633000	And I was like, well, that would be a twist if there's a Silent Hill game on the Xbox.
633000	634000	But no, it's the Blair Witch thing.
634000	635000	But that's cool.
635000	639000	Like I, you know, say what you want about where that franchise ended up.
639000	648000	When that movie first came out, if you're too young to remember, when that movie first came out, that movie mind fucked people in the biggest way.
648000	651000	Because the internet wasn't like everywhere yet.
651000	654000	So not everybody knew that that movie was fake.
654000	656000	And they really tried to sell it off as real.
656000	659000	Like that was the first like found footage horror movie.
659000	661000	Not the, but the first that took off the way it did.
661000	662000	You know what I mean?
662000	664000	So it's interesting to see them revisit that I think.
664000	666000	So pretty cool.
666000	671000	Anyway, after the Blair Witch was Cyberpunk 2077 and all the footage.
671000	672000	Which looks amazing.
672000	676000	Yeah, you know, I haven't been following the Cyberpunk stuff super closely.
676000	681000	But you know, you can definitely tell a lot of that cinematography from what you'd see with The Witcher.
681000	687000	You know, and a lot of the really amazing graphical style you can see comes into play with that.
687000	689000	And it looked really good.
689000	691000	It was announced for a release in 2020.
691000	693000	So it's not going to happen this year.
693000	698000	But hopefully with the 2020 release, we're not talking about crunch time or any of that stuff.
698000	703000	But what made me happy was the little footage of Keanu Reeves at the end.
703000	705000	Which I think made a lot of people go, whoa.
705000	707000	Because I don't think people knew that was coming, right?
707000	709000	So we got to see the Keanu Reeves.
709000	712000	And then out from backstage, Keanu Reeves.
712000	714000	He's there and he does his little spiel.
714000	716000	He's being very Keanu Reeves.
716000	717000	He's very endearing.
717000	718000	The audience loves him.
718000	719000	He gets heckled.
719000	723000	But in the most Sesame Street kind of way.
723000	727000	Where somebody from the audience says, you're breathtaking.
727000	729000	And Keanu goes, no, you're breathtaking.
729000	733000	And it's just like the loveliest verbal pillow fight you've ever seen.
733000	735000	It was a very pure wholesome E3 moment.
735000	737000	Which we don't usually get enough of.
737000	741000	So yeah, I was not expecting that with Cyberpunk 2077.
741000	745000	But it did look, it looks like a pretty compelling game.
745000	747000	So I'm sure a lot of people are going to be very into that.
747000	749000	Let's see, moving on.
749000	751000	Actually going to a question here.
751000	756000	Black Mamba 1977 in chat says, do you think they'll ever make an Alan Wake game that's multi-platform?
756000	759000	I miss that game but don't want to get a new Xbox.
759000	760000	No hate to the console.
760000	763000	The Xbox hasn't been kind to me console wise.
763000	765000	Well also one thing to keep in mind.
765000	768000	I don't know if it would go to PlayStation.
768000	770000	But it'll go to PC.
770000	773000	If you have a PC that's strong enough to play it.
773000	775000	Is what I would say today.
775000	778000	But this whole xCloud thing of the future.
778000	780000	They didn't get into that too much.
780000	784000	No, it seems like it's more of just like kind of like remote play.
784000	785000	Like how that was with.
785000	789000	But then they also said that it's either your console or it's the cloud.
789000	791000	I think, not to get too ahead of ourselves.
791000	797000	But I think the reason, my guess for that is that if you have a Project Scarlett console.
797000	801000	It's going to render everything and do all that stuff in real time and all that good stuff.
801000	804000	But if you don't have a Project Scarlett console, you have an Xbox One console.
804000	809000	You use the cloud thing to play the game on the Xbox One console.
809000	812000	And it's their processing power but it's on your Xbox One.
812000	815000	So what they're probably going to say is you can buy this new console.
815000	817000	Or you can just keep your original console and play these new games.
817000	820000	But you'll have to be connected to the internet to play these new games.
820000	825000	And I would imagine that the Xbox One will be able to read those discs somehow.
825000	828000	So it will still know you have a copy of that game in there.
828000	830000	Because that would be kind of interesting, wouldn't it?
830000	834000	That if you're paying for a game and it's a disc that will work on a Project Scarlett.
834000	841000	But if you put it in an Xbox One, it unlocks the game on xCloud for you to play while the disc is in there.
841000	844000	Which is how backwards compatibility kind of works today.
844000	848000	You're not playing it in the cloud, but you still have to have your 360 disc in the Xbox One.
848000	851000	That unlocks what you're playing a digital copy of the game.
851000	853000	Kind of like that, I think.
855000	856000	Any thoughts?
856000	858000	I don't know if that's how it's going to work, but we'll see.
858000	860000	There's still a lot to be explained there, that's for sure.
860000	865000	Other games. Spiritfarer, which looked kind of cute and artsy.
865000	869000	It looked a little mobile to me, but I'd be curious about more.
869000	872000	Because it looked kind of like a building game and so forth.
872000	874000	And then Battletoads showed up.
874000	877000	So finally we got to see what Battletoads actually looks like in motion.
877000	879000	They're going for a very cartoony style.
879000	882000	Not like Cuphead cartoony, but very like, you know...
882000	884000	Modern DuckTales or...
884000	888000	DuckTales or Castle Crashers. It looked a lot like Castle Crashers to me, but like Battletoads.
888000	892000	So that kind of made me go, is this a $60 game?
892000	895000	Because this looks like Castle Crashers, which was like a $20 game.
895000	900000	So I'm not sure we saw enough of Battletoads if it's going to be a full game.
900000	904000	But at the same time, and this is something important we have to keep in the back of our heads.
904000	911000	Microsoft doesn't necessarily always want us thinking about, it's a $20 game, it's a $60 game.
911000	915000	Microsoft wants you thinking about, I get to play this with my Game Pass subscription.
915000	916000	Exactly.
916000	924000	So maybe this whole, is it $20? Maybe that whole debate is going to be a thing of the past before too long.
924000	926000	I don't know. Anyway.
927000	931000	Let's see, what else? After Battletoads was the...
931000	934000	They got into RPG Time, The Legend of Right.
934000	937000	That was like the notepad sketch looking game that looks like...
937000	938000	Yeah, it looked pretty cool.
938000	942000	Yeah, it looked complicated. There was a lot of stuff going on in that UI.
942000	946000	It was a messy UI, but I'm sure the game walks you through it a little bit.
946000	948000	So I would like to know more.
948000	951000	ID at Xbox, where they kind of rapid fire went through...
951000	955000	This is how they get 60 games at you. They rapid fire go through the indie games that are being developed.
955000	960000	I didn't catch them all. I only caught the one that was called Supermarket Shriek, because that made me laugh.
960000	962000	Yeah, that's the one with the goat. I remember that.
962000	964000	Yes, that one made me laugh.
964000	968000	And then they talked about Xbox Game Pass for a little bit.
968000	976000	They talked about Xbox Game Pass on PC, which I have to be honest, the games that they were spotlighting for Xbox games on PC didn't exactly make me go,
977000	981000	but I think they were trying to pick things that maybe don't exist on Xbox One.
981000	985000	Does Football Manager 19, is that something you can play on your Xbox One? I don't think it is.
985000	986000	I don't know.
986000	992000	So I think they were trying to maybe pick things that were kind of PC specific, but then there's a lot of overlap with the Xbox One.
992000	999000	But then they showed that, they reiterated the Xbox One version, and then they came out and said,
999000	1005000	we're going to offer you this Xbox Ultimate Pass for $14.99.
1005000	1015000	We're going to have an Xbox Pass that is the Xbox Game Pass for the system, for the PC, and Xbox Gold for $14.99 a month.
1015000	1018000	And even you asked this when you came in here tonight, and I think a lot of people have been asking,
1018000	1025000	well, we knew Microsoft was looking at doing this bundle, but isn't $14.99 the cost of just Game Pass today and Gold?
1025000	1031000	Yes. So now what they did to sweeten the pot is that they're throwing in PC Game Pass, which as I understand is still separate,
1031000	1033000	is part of that $14.99.
1033000	1036000	I've got to admit, I think I'm going to do it.
1036000	1043000	And I heard something about that it's actually a dollar a month promotional pricing if you still have an active Xbox Gold.
1043000	1047000	Because right now I'm paid through February on my Xbox plan.
1047000	1049000	Because you buy that annually, right?
1049000	1051000	So I heard something about you get a dollar a month.
1051000	1056000	Don't quote me on this. I haven't read all the terms and conditions, but at least you get a little bit of a dollar a month for a little bit of that.
1056000	1060000	And I've got to admit, I think I'm going to do it.
1060000	1062000	Why not?
1062000	1070000	There's a lot of games that I'm spending $60 on when they come out, like Forza Horizon and stuff, that I think I just would sign up for the Game Pass.
1070000	1072000	I'm playing that way, to be honest.
1072000	1075000	So, anyway.
1075000	1079000	Let's see, I'm looking in our chat here for some other comments.
1079000	1083000	Tigerclaw does point out, as far as Battletoads goes, it did show new speeder bike levels.
1083000	1086000	Sure, it did. And yeah, I remember how those levels were notorious.
1086000	1091000	Sure, instead of like a third person, though, it was like a first person.
1091000	1096000	No, it was still third person, but it was just instead of being side scrolling, it was going into...
1096000	1098000	Oh yeah, it was more like over the shoulder.
1098000	1100000	Yeah, yeah, yeah. For sure.
1100000	1102000	It can be less annoying.
1102000	1106000	Let's see, and then they showed a new flight simulator.
1106000	1111000	They showed Microsoft Flight Simulator, which again, not a series you always associate with Xbox.
1111000	1116000	I think those flight simulator games were always very PC-centric, but it looked gorgeous.
1116000	1118000	It really looked good.
1118000	1122000	And I was just sitting there the whole time going, but I'm not good at the simulator part.
1122000	1124000	Can I just press F to fly?
1124000	1128000	And apparently Bobby Blackwell says yes, there is a Bobby Blackwell mode in flight simulator.
1128000	1132000	So you can just fly the damn plane and enjoy the scenery, which I think will be lovely.
1132000	1139000	And again, if that's a part of Game Pass, for me, I'm like, okay, I wouldn't have thought of dropping $60 on flight simulator,
1139000	1141000	but like pay in the 15 a month.
1141000	1144000	Does it have a VR mode? Because that would be awesome.
1144000	1148000	Interesting enough, VR AR completely left out of Microsoft's conversation today.
1148000	1151000	It's just, you know, we talked a little bit about this at the end of Bobby's show.
1151000	1155000	It's just not something they're doing with Xbox right now, it seems.
1155000	1160000	But, you know, had Sony gone to E3 this year, I'm sure VR would have been a part of their conversation.
1160000	1165000	So it is just an interesting little unique difference between the two consoles right now is that, you know,
1165000	1170000	Microsoft is really focusing on this games and PC and Xbox are their platforms,
1170000	1175000	whereas Sony is looking at games with PlayStation and VR enhanced is kind of their world right now.
1175000	1179000	So you're kind of starting to see a little more of a division between those two, for sure.
1179000	1186000	So after flight simulator was the new Age of Empires game, Age of Empires II, which I have to admit, I don't get it.
1186000	1190000	As into those games I do Civ, but I know those games have their fans, so I'm sure they were very happy.
1190000	1196000	Wasteland 3 was shown as well, which, again, not a series I've gotten into yet,
1196000	1199000	but I thought they did a good job with the trailer.
1199000	1202000	I'm trying to pick up the pace a little bit here because I have a lot to get through.
1202000	1206000	Big shoe dropping, Double Fine acquired by Xbox.
1206000	1210000	As if all of their acquisitions last year weren't enough, they came out and said,
1210000	1213000	not only did we acquire all of them, we got one more, Double Fine.
1213000	1217000	Some pressed people on my Twitter feed about that, not happy about that one.
1217000	1222000	But I have to admit, I'm trying to come from that perspective of, to me,
1222000	1229000	it's because the reason why a lot of people are oppressed is because the Double Fine fans, some that I know, are like,
1229000	1234000	dang it, I like Psychonauts, I like those games, those are the types of games I want to play,
1234000	1240000	I don't want to have to go to freaking Xbox, I don't like Xbox because they don't have my kind of games.
1240000	1244000	Well, y'all, that's why Microsoft did it.
1244000	1249000	Microsoft's trying to win those people over because you don't like Microsoft
1249000	1251000	because they don't have those kind of games. Well, guess what?
1251000	1254000	They just bought to get those kind of games.
1254000	1256000	That's their strategy.
1256000	1258000	Maybe on PC too, I'm sure.
1258000	1261000	Yeah, and I'm sure a lot of folks will enjoy Psychonauts 2 on PC and so forth,
1261000	1266000	which is also interesting that Psychonauts 2 is now so closely related with Microsoft
1266000	1271000	when the first one didn't go so well, because the first one was supposed to be an Xbox exclusive.
1271000	1279000	But also, I think we know the folks that are running Xbox completely different from what it used to be.
1279000	1281000	I mean, props to Phil Spencer, am I right?
1281000	1284000	Phil Spencer has turned the Xbox One ship around.
1284000	1287000	He should really be commended, so good job, Phil Spencer.
1287000	1290000	Especially considering to who they used to have.
1290000	1292000	I mean, he's been miles and light years beyond.
1292000	1294000	I feel like Phil Spencer gets it.
1294000	1298000	Phil Spencer is like a gamer, whereas the last guy was an executive, you know what I mean?
1298000	1301000	So, kudos to Phil Spencer, honestly.
1301000	1303000	Let's see.
1303000	1306000	Going on to more games.
1306000	1309000	The Lego Star Wars Skywalker Saga.
1309000	1311000	All nine games in one.
1311000	1314000	But it's not like a compilation. It's a brand new game.
1314000	1316000	No, it's a brand new game. It's all nine movies in one.
1316000	1318000	Yeah, that'd be cool.
1318000	1320000	That seems a little cluster fucky to me, but
1320000	1323000	Lego has their unique sense of humor and their unique way of doing things.
1323000	1324000	I'm sure it'll be fine.
1324000	1325000	Yeah, it'll be fine.
1325000	1326000	Yeah, it'll be fine.
1326000	1329000	And then they showed the Project Z, the Dragon Ball Z Kakarot.
1329000	1331000	I don't know if I said that right. Sorry, guys.
1331000	1334000	I don't really play a lot of the Dragon Ball Z stuff,
1334000	1338000	but I think it's cool that Microsoft is showcasing something like that
1338000	1342000	because that, again, is the type of game that you don't always associate with Microsoft,
1342000	1346000	but here they are giving a pretty decent chunk of time to it, so I thought that was very interesting.
1346000	1349000	So, from a strategical perspective, I was kind of into that.
1349000	1352000	And then after that, they showed, actually, the game that really...
1352000	1354000	This was one of the standouts for me.
1354000	1356000	12 Minutes was the game after that.
1356000	1358000	It's an Annapurna Studios game.
1358000	1360000	It was a time loop thriller game.
1360000	1363000	So, she was like, oh, I got you a present, and he goes,
1363000	1366000	I already know what's in the box, and you killed your dad,
1366000	1369000	and a guy's coming through that door, and it was very scary.
1369000	1372000	Which time loops are all the rage right now. Have you seen Russian Dolls?
1372000	1376000	There was another game during the Bethesda conference that's also based around a time loop.
1376000	1377000	Oh, what did they...
1377000	1378000	It's called Deathloop.
1378000	1383000	Oh, so another time... Time loops are in. Time loops are the new battle royale.
1383000	1385000	Where's my time loop, Fallout 76?
1388000	1390000	Be careful. Be careful what you wish for.
1390000	1393000	Alright, and then they showed a game called Way to the Woods,
1393000	1398000	which, like, you played as this moose that was using their antlers to, like, smash windows and things,
1398000	1403000	and I was reminded of Tokyo Jungle randomly, but the art style was very different and very cool.
1403000	1407000	But I also won a sequel to Tokyo Jungle, so PlayStation 5 made that happen.
1408000	1412000	And then they got into the Gears Pop mobile game, right?
1413000	1414000	Cute.
1414000	1419000	State of Decay 2, which I see another zombie game and my eyes kind of glaze over.
1419000	1422000	Well, it's State of Decay 2, I think it's an expansion to that.
1422000	1427000	Yeah, but I see another zombie, my eyes glaze over, but I thought it was a well-done trailer.
1427000	1430000	It looked interesting. I was like, okay, this looks like it might be interesting.
1431000	1435000	And then they show Phantasy Star Online 2, and I melted, I died, I was resurrected.
1435000	1441000	No, there's a part of me, like, don't get me wrong, I am really excited about Phantasy Star Online 2 happening,
1441000	1450000	but I've hit that it's been so long, I kind of go, well, what are they going to do to, like, A, catch up, B,
1450000	1456000	a lot of people have already visited Phantasy Star Online 2, how are they going to make this now a game for 2019?
1456000	1458000	That's kind of what I'm curious about, you know what I mean?
1458000	1459000	Yeah.
1459000	1464000	Or are they just going to kind of rest on their laurels and hope that we kind of eat up what they've delivered seven years ago in another country?
1464000	1473000	But I'm really excited to check it out for sure, so don't get me wrong, I'm just like, it's kind of like one of those sighs of relief,
1473000	1476000	like, finally, this is happening, I just hope it's done well.
1476000	1481000	I was kind of surprised it didn't, I would have thought if Phantasy Star Online 2 was going to happen,
1481000	1487000	I'm surprised it wasn't a Nintendo Switch thing, which, yes, I know the Switch does the whole cloud gaming thing,
1487000	1493000	but still, it's on the Switch overseas, it's on PlayStation overseas, I'm kind of surprised now it's Xbox over here,
1493000	1501000	that alone is interesting in how it changes the conversation, but it should be noted, Phantasy Star Universe,
1501000	1505000	which a lot of y'all slept on, you didn't like it as much as Phantasy Star Online, I thought it was alright,
1505000	1510000	Phantasy Star Universe was an Xbox 360 game, Phantasy Star Universe was not PlayStation, Phantasy Star Universe was not Nintendo's platform,
1510000	1516000	so Microsoft does have a precedent of supporting the series, there is that.
1516000	1522000	After that, they hyped this series that I guess tons of people around the world play,
1522000	1526000	and I have to note, I didn't, Crossfire X, I didn't...
1526000	1527000	It's in Korea, I think.
1527000	1532000	Okay, that's, I'm like, it has to be a game overseas that's huge, and remember,
1532000	1537000	Microsoft does business in many other places than just North America, so I'm sure they had...
1537000	1543000	I forget where it's from, it's either China or Korea, and it's basically of the size of Fortnite over there.
1543000	1545000	Bobby says it's Korea's Counter-Strike.
1545000	1546000	Counter-Strike, yeah.
1546000	1547000	Yeah, basically.
1547000	1554000	So, let's see, and then after that was Tales of Arise, so Tales of Symphonia, Tales of...
1554000	1559000	So it's like Namco, Bandai's JRPG, looks really nice, actually, the art style looks really cool,
1559000	1563000	and I'm always glad to see RPGs on Xbox, that's a great thing.
1563000	1567000	Then they show Borderlands 3, which I'm sure you have more opinions on.
1567000	1571000	Yeah, it looks good, I mean, it's a kind of similar trailer, except I did laugh when, you know,
1571000	1575000	Claptrap is trying to chase after the gun with legs and it runs up the stairs,
1575000	1578000	because that's, you know, his greatest weakness, his stairs.
1578000	1579000	Yeah.
1579000	1580000	He's like, no!
1580000	1581000	And it's hilarious.
1581000	1587000	Did you think it was interesting how they would bleep words, because they bleeped Claptrap in that,
1587000	1590000	and they bleeped a lot of stuff in the Cyberpunk 2077?
1590000	1594000	It's only in that broadcast, because I think it's family-friendly and it goes on the Xbox as well,
1594000	1598000	but if you actually watch the trailer outside of that, like, I would rewatch the Cyberpunk trailer,
1598000	1599000	and it's not.
1599000	1600000	It's just...
1600000	1604000	But what was, okay, but, like, family-friendly, did you see all that violence,
1604000	1606000	and did you catch the finger in the Cyberpunk thing?
1606000	1611000	Like, I wouldn't say it was family-friendly, they just bleeped the language, which I thought was weird.
1611000	1614000	Well, some people are more offended by language than blood.
1614000	1618000	Okay, there's a whole commentary just waiting in there, but I'm gonna leave it at that,
1618000	1622000	because it's a three-hour show, we don't have enough time if I get on that tangent.
1622000	1627000	So, the next game that they showed was Elden Ring,
1627000	1632000	and this is the big Miyazaki and R.R. Martin, George R.R. Martin coming together.
1632000	1633000	Lots of people will die.
1633000	1636000	Yes, lots of people, your faves will be killed.
1636000	1642000	But the trailer was very cinematic, of course, no actual game to be seen there,
1642000	1645000	but I'm sure that's not gonna stop the hype machine for a lot of people.
1645000	1647000	It looks good, I don't know what it is.
1647000	1651000	Yeah, I know, I'm curious to hear more, but it's very early on right now.
1651000	1657000	And then, after that, the rest of the time was spent on the new console.
1657000	1659000	So, not everybody was expecting this.
1659000	1662000	Did we talk about the Forza Horizon Lego thing?
1662000	1665000	Oh, I skipped over it, I'm sorry, you're right.
1665000	1667000	Forza, how could I miss that, Bobby?
1667000	1670000	Forza Horizon 4's Lego expansion, yeah, looks great.
1670000	1671000	Which comes out this week.
1671000	1673000	Yeah, and it's like right now, too.
1673000	1675000	I was saying they could make a whole other game out of that.
1675000	1676000	They should.
1676000	1677000	Honestly, I'm kind of surprised.
1677000	1680000	It's kind of interesting because where it's like Battletoads is one of those,
1680000	1684000	like, oh, they're gonna maybe charge full price for this game
1684000	1687000	that may be more like an online thing.
1687000	1691000	They could probably get away with doing a whole Lego spin-off Horizon game themselves
1691000	1695000	and get away with it, but no, it's DLC.
1695000	1697000	Anything else I missed?
1700000	1703000	No, I think that was it.
1703000	1706000	Yeah, Bobby Blackwolf pointing out, after all the how dare yous,
1706000	1709000	we also thought Hot Wheels could have been its own game.
1709000	1714000	And SSG100Matt over at twitch.tv slash vlog network says, Lego, all the things.
1714000	1717000	Yes, there was a lot of Lego in that Crest Commons, wasn't there?
1717000	1721000	What I really liked in that trailer, obviously it looks great,
1721000	1724000	but I really like that remix of Everything is Awesome
1724000	1726000	that sounded like a song you would hear in Forza Horizon.
1726000	1730000	It was like a Eurotrance type of version of that song.
1730000	1731000	It was awesome.
1731000	1733000	Then we got into the new console,
1733000	1737000	which they did not give a further name to beyond Project Scarlet,
1737000	1739000	which obviously will not be the final name,
1739000	1741000	but they're still referring to it as Project Scarlet.
1741000	1746000	And we had a little talking head piece about people hyping up the console.
1746000	1750000	Very interesting in that talking head piece that we ticked all the boxes
1750000	1752000	that Sony has ticked so far.
1752000	1755000	And they're tiny, tiny little, hey, we invited somebody into our office
1755000	1758000	before they did a leak story on this.
1758000	1762000	So the SSD drive, check, Microsoft's doing it too.
1762000	1764000	GDDR6 RAM.
1764000	1766000	Ray tracing, all that stuff checked off.
1766000	1768000	Zen 2 architecture.
1768000	1770000	So Microsoft level set.
1770000	1772000	What Sony's doing, we're doing.
1772000	1773000	So we're on the same page.
1773000	1777000	Now Microsoft took it one step further by showing you
1777000	1779000	here's what ray tracing looks like.
1779000	1782000	And we got maybe 30 seconds of glimpse
1782000	1785000	at these random things that were running.
1785000	1790000	I remember a scenery shot of these wildlife in an environmental thing,
1790000	1792000	and it kind of showed the ray tracing in action.
1792000	1794000	Looked really nice, right?
1794000	1795000	So we got those little glimpses.
1795000	1799000	And then, of course, a big glimpse at Halo Infinite,
1799000	1802000	which is going to be their big kickoff title,
1802000	1806000	taking a page from the original Xbox and launching with a Halo game.
1806000	1808000	Have a good strong title to launch the system with.
1808000	1812000	Or one might say taking a page from Nintendo,
1812000	1815000	who launched the Switch with Breath of the Wild.
1815000	1819000	Because Halo Infinite, I mean, Microsoft has said before,
1819000	1820000	am I right?
1820000	1825000	You can play any game they announce from now on on your Xbox One, right?
1825000	1827000	Because it's probably going to be this whole cloud thing.
1827000	1830000	So Halo Infinite will be for the past console,
1830000	1832000	but it's also going to be the kickoff for the new console.
1832000	1833000	Yeah.
1833000	1835000	And it will...
1835000	1840000	I mean, it wasn't very Halo-y, what we saw, but it was well done.
1840000	1841000	Yeah.
1841000	1846000	Especially that scene when the little princess Leia hologram type thing was coming in.
1846000	1848000	Just look at the detail on that.
1848000	1850000	It looked really amazingly detailed on that whole thing.
1850000	1851000	Yeah.
1851000	1852000	So that was good.
1852000	1853000	And then, of course, you do see the Master Chief,
1853000	1856000	and you saw what I thought was going to be the tutorial.
1856000	1858000	I thought it was going to suddenly take over,
1858000	1861000	because it was a good setup for now that we've got you plugged in,
1861000	1863000	let's make sure you're working again.
1863000	1864000	Look over here.
1864000	1866000	Use RS to move.
1866000	1867000	Now look over here.
1867000	1868000	Well, it could be in the game.
1868000	1871000	But maybe it jumped a few steps ahead.
1871000	1872000	I don't know.
1872000	1877000	But yeah, that was pretty hot, that Halo Infinite look.
1877000	1879000	So that was everything for Microsoft.
1879000	1881000	I know I talked a lot about that, but there was a lot to digest.
1881000	1885000	So overall, you thought it was pretty good.
1885000	1886000	I thought it was pretty good too.
1886000	1887000	Yeah, I think they did a good job.
1887000	1888000	I think they did too.
1888000	1890000	I don't think they did anything that was like,
1890000	1894000	oh shit, Sony's going to regret not coming this year.
1894000	1899000	There wasn't a lot of, I think, unexpected titles from them.
1899000	1903000	It was kind of like showing you some more stuff that we've seen already.
1903000	1905000	I mean, we've already seen a lot of those.
1905000	1907000	It's not like brand new, like this is a...
1907000	1909000	Fantasy Star Online 2 was unexpected.
1909000	1913000	It was unexpected, but it wasn't something from what our studios are working on,
1913000	1915000	exclusive games for us type of thing.
1915000	1916000	It wasn't anything like that.
1916000	1917000	But it was fine.
1917000	1918000	It was all right.
1918000	1922000	Yeah, I thought they did a very good message of games, games, games, games, games.
1922000	1924000	They really did show a lot,
1924000	1927000	and especially for what is essentially a lame duck year
1927000	1929000	for the current gen consoles, right?
1929000	1930000	That's what you call, you know,
1930000	1932000	well, we all know there's a new gen coming,
1932000	1933000	so this is the last year,
1933000	1935000	and this is why Sony's kind of taken it off,
1935000	1937000	because if Sony showed up to E3 this year,
1937000	1938000	what would they be showing?
1938000	1941000	Death Stranding, which they've shown a bunch of already.
1941000	1942000	Last of Us 2.
1942000	1944000	Last of Us 2, which they showed a lot of last year.
1944000	1946000	And the year before that.
1946000	1948000	Yeah, they would show Final Fantasy 7 Remake,
1948000	1949000	which they've already shown on Square.
1949000	1950000	It's got their own thing anyway.
1950000	1951000	Tomorrow, yeah.
1951000	1955000	So I just think Sony, maybe their bridge games,
1955000	1957000	they already milked the hype out of those.
1957000	1960000	I'm surprised we didn't see more Call of Duty Modern Warfare,
1960000	1962000	because you know how they kind of do those like,
1962000	1964000	you know, hey, let's show some of this person,
1964000	1967000	third party company's game, or something like that.
1967000	1972000	Or, well, I guess Assassin's Creed will see that in Ubisoft.
1972000	1976000	Well, yeah, what were you surprised was not there?
1976000	1980000	I don't really have any expectations,
1980000	1982000	so I guess not really anything.
1982000	1983000	That's true, lower them expectations, right?
1983000	1985000	I guess I would say the VR AR thing,
1985000	1988000	just the fact that they didn't address it at all,
1988000	1989000	is an interesting thing.
1989000	1991000	It does definitely show you here's Microsoft,
1991000	1994000	where they're at, versus here's where Sony's at.
1994000	1996000	I would have liked to have seen some download content
1996000	1999000	for Crackdown 3, because I really have no reason
1999000	2000000	to play that game again.
2000000	2003000	And I'm kind of sad that it's just like was so short
2003000	2005000	and kind of meh.
2005000	2008000	Top three out of that whole event.
2008000	2009000	I'll do mine.
2009000	2011000	Top three, PSO2, hello.
2011000	2016000	12 minutes, and the 1499 Ultimate Xbox Pass thing.
2016000	2020000	I think that's, and especially considering
2020000	2021000	what we're going to talk about next,
2021000	2024000	I think Xbox got me on that.
2024000	2026000	But what about your top three?
2026000	2033000	Cyberpunk 2077, Outer Worlds, and I'd say Borderlands 3.
2033000	2035000	Good picks, solid picks.
2035000	2040000	Let's see, Bobby wants to, I guess, reiterate something
2040000	2041000	he said on Twitter.
2041000	2043000	Oh, wow, Scarlet News.
2043000	2045000	I made a tweet during the conference about wanting
2045000	2048000	to still play 4K Blu-rays and 4K Netflix on Scarlet
2048000	2050000	so it could just replace my Xbox One X.
2050000	2053000	A Microsoft dev lead that works on xCloud
2053000	2057000	and the display app replied to me during my show saying,
2057000	2062000	all good, so 4K UHD Blu-ray player for Scarlet confirmed?
2062000	2063000	Question, question.
2063000	2064000	Hooray.
2064000	2065000	I would think that's the kind of thing
2065000	2067000	Microsoft doesn't want to confirm right now,
2067000	2071000	because Microsoft has set the precedent a little bit
2071000	2073000	that they're willing to go all digital.
2073000	2078000	So maybe they'll be different versions of Scarlet.
2078000	2080000	Maybe one of them will play Blu-rays
2080000	2082000	because that licensing fee and all that, right?
2082000	2084000	And maybe one of them won't.
2084000	2088000	You know, theorizing, fantasizing, we'll see, right?
2088000	2089000	We'll see.
2089000	2090000	I don't know.
2090000	2094000	Bobby Black Wolf also noting Forza Motorsport 8
2094000	2096000	as a noticeable thing that wasn't there
2096000	2097000	that was surprising.
2097000	2100000	Yeah, you know, you would expect a new Forza game
2100000	2102000	on the, what, odd number years
2102000	2105000	and a Horizon game on the even number years at this point.
2105000	2108000	But I think if we know that a new console is coming in 2020,
2108000	2111000	if those rumors are true that Turn 10,
2111000	2113000	which I know is Horizon's, folks,
2113000	2119000	but if they're working on a RPG type of thing and all this,
2119000	2123000	if all that's true, then maybe Forza's just taken the year off.
2123000	2124000	Probably.
2124000	2128000	What I would imagine is going to be, I mean, hello,
2128000	2131000	ray tracing and top-of-the-line graphics,
2131000	2134000	that's just begging for Scarlet, the new console.
2134000	2136000	So I think they're just sitting on Motorsport 8
2136000	2138000	for the new console, I think.
2138000	2141000	Oh, I'm sorry, playground games, not Turn 10.
2141000	2142000	My bad.
2142000	2145000	I got them backwards, as people often do.
2145000	2146000	All right, let's see.
2146000	2149000	So let's, I guess let's move on, shall we?
2149000	2152000	Let's get to what else happened during E3 week.
2152000	2154000	The EA Play event also happened.
2154000	2156000	So we had Microsoft's event, we had EA Play.
2156000	2158000	Did you watch EA Play?
2158000	2161000	I only caught the part with Star Wars in it
2161000	2163000	because I could care less,
2163000	2166000	I couldn't care less about the sports stuff,
2166000	2171000	and I don't play Apex Legends, so I think that was basically it.
2171000	2173000	I didn't catch it, it was just a bad time for me
2173000	2176000	because we had Sacramento Pride going on this weekend,
2176000	2178000	and I was hanging out with friends yesterday for that,
2178000	2180000	so I just missed the whole thing.
2180000	2182000	And kind of similar thought, I was like, eh,
2182000	2184000	I mean, if they announce a new Dragon Age or something,
2184000	2186000	I'll see a trailer about that later on.
2186000	2189000	They didn't, so we didn't miss any of that.
2189000	2193000	Here's what they did recap at EA Play for E3 2019.
2193000	2195000	They pretty much focused on six games,
2195000	2197000	including Star Wars Jedi Fallen Order.
2197000	2199000	They did the first 15 minutes of gameplay,
2199000	2203000	and that's all, of course, available on YouTube now in the archives,
2203000	2205000	if you want to check that out.
2205000	2206000	They did show more Apex Legends.
2206000	2209000	There's a new character that they unveiled, Watson.
2209000	2211000	And there's a new short to go with it,
2211000	2213000	kind of like when they announce a new Overwatch character.
2213000	2215000	Yeah, kind of cute the way they did that,
2215000	2218000	but I think people responding very positively to Watson,
2218000	2222000	the character, it's bringing a nice new kit for the game.
2222000	2226000	Also a new weapon from Titanfall 2 that crossed over in Apex Legends,
2226000	2228000	so you're seeing a little bit more of that universe starting to come together.
2228000	2230000	Unless that weapon is Titans, I don't really care.
2230000	2232000	I can't remember what you wish for.
2232000	2234000	And then a ranked mode coming to Apex as well,
2234000	2237000	which I'm sure surprises nobody, right? Yeah.
2237000	2239000	They showed Battlefield V.
2239000	2241000	They showed some new maps.
2241000	2245000	The Battle of Greece, North Africa map.
2245000	2247000	There's a classic Battlefield map.
2247000	2250000	Oh, the North Africa Al-Sudan is a classic map
2250000	2253000	that mixes up foot, vehicles, and air combat mode.
2253000	2255000	So, okay.
2255000	2257000	And then they showed more Star Wars Battlefront II,
2257000	2258000	just a little bit.
2258000	2260000	Obviously, this game's been out for a while,
2260000	2262000	but they did want to point out that Naboo,
2262000	2265000	a capital supremacy map, is coming on June 26th,
2265000	2269000	and there's also the Droideka and the TX-30 tank.
2269000	2271000	Then they talked a little bit about FIFA 20,
2271000	2273000	because, of course, EA's got to cover sports,
2273000	2276000	and despite however you might feel about FIFA,
2276000	2278000	it's like the biggest game in the world.
2278000	2281000	So they had to talk about FIFA 20, and they did that a little bit.
2281000	2285000	And Volta is a new mode inside FIFA 20.
2285000	2287000	It's street-style soccer.
2287000	2289000	So street soccer, which I have never seen.
2289000	2291000	They've had FIFA Street, so it makes sense.
2291000	2293000	I've never seen played here in the States,
2293000	2296000	but obviously it's a little more worldwide
2296000	2299000	when we're talking about FIFA.
2299000	2303000	Madden 20, because, again, they have to show the sports games,
2303000	2306000	and Madden's one of them, so they showed a little bit of that.
2306000	2309000	And The Sims 4 is getting a new expansion.
2309000	2313000	Island Living is the new expansion for Sims 4,
2313000	2317000	which is still going as we come up on the 20th year of The Sims.
2317000	2319000	And I was pretty pleasantly surprised
2319000	2322000	that Sims 4 is still trucking along with all the content.
2322000	2324000	And I've got to admit, I haven't been following the series so closely,
2324000	2327000	but I know people that do that were excited to hear
2327000	2329000	that there is still more content coming for the game.
2329000	2331000	That's pretty cool.
2331000	2334000	So that, in a nutshell, was EA Play.
2334000	2336000	So I guess...
2336000	2338000	Favorites there? Star Wars, the only thing I saw.
2338000	2342000	Yeah, and honestly, well, I like Apex enough.
2342000	2344000	I need to play it more. I need to give it a better shot.
2344000	2347000	So I like that Apex is still trucking along
2347000	2349000	and that they're doing animated shorts with it.
2349000	2351000	I think that's pretty cool.
2351000	2356000	Alright, let's move on and talk about the Pokemon Direct.
2356000	2358000	I'm sure you were excited about this, right?
2358000	2360000	I didn't watch it.
2360000	2362000	I watched kind of like the highlights.
2362000	2365000	It was on too fucking early to watch it live.
2365000	2368000	So of course you get all the highlights on Twitter, right?
2368000	2372000	So we got to see things like the new Pokemon they announced,
2372000	2375000	such as Wooloo, who is a sheep
2375000	2379000	and everybody on my Twitter feed seems to be standing Wooloo,
2379000	2381000	because Wooloo is an adorable little sheep Pokemon.
2381000	2384000	Mareep is crying that you've all forgotten Mareep already.
2384000	2387000	Wooloo shipping immediately. It was just ridiculous.
2387000	2390000	It's like a goddamn sheep, folks.
2390000	2392000	Gossifleur was another Pokemon.
2392000	2395000	Drednaw. Corviknight, which was kind of a cool little
2395000	2398000	badass raven knight looking thing.
2398000	2400000	Eldegoss was another one as well.
2400000	2402000	The Wild Area.
2402000	2405000	A Wild Area is an area that stretches between cities
2405000	2407000	and different Pokemon appear depending on where you are
2407000	2409000	and what the weather is like.
2409000	2413000	You have full 360 degree control over the cameras.
2413000	2416000	That's a little different than Pokemon games of the past.
2416000	2418000	So now it's a little more of a 3D environment.
2418000	2420000	Breath of the Pokemon.
2420000	2422000	I don't know if I go that far, but certainly...
2422000	2425000	Can I light fire to the tall grass?
2425000	2427000	Yeah, it's going to be a big change.
2427000	2432000	Dynamaxing, which some people don't feel so hot about.
2432000	2435000	Make my monster grow!
2435000	2438000	You can make your Pokemon do maximum capabilities,
2438000	2440000	max moves.
2440000	2443000	You can use it once in a battle and it lasts for three turns.
2443000	2445000	So this is going to be, you know,
2445000	2448000	when do you do it and all this is going to be key.
2448000	2450000	They do not call this an evolution.
2450000	2453000	They don't want to confuse it with Z-moves and make evolutions.
2453000	2456000	Dynamax. It's the new thing.
2456000	2459000	Kind of sounds like a weight gain drug, so I guess it's all good.
2459000	2461000	Max raid battles. This sounded kind of cool
2461000	2463000	because it sounded like a Pokemon Go kind of thing
2463000	2466000	that they took and they're putting in the mainline games now
2466000	2470000	because it's a multiplayer event and what you do in the wild area,
2470000	2472000	different Dynamax Pokemon.
2472000	2474000	And again, I think that's kind of clever because if you think about it,
2474000	2476000	that's how it works in Pokemon Go, right?
2476000	2479000	You have these supercharged Pokemon that you battle at the raid gyms
2479000	2481000	and then they come down in size for you to catch.
2481000	2485000	So in some ways, maybe you can blame Pokemon Go for your Dynamax Pokemon.
2485000	2487000	I don't know. I don't know.
2487000	2491000	But anyway, you basically come together and you do a party of four
2491000	2494000	and the Pokemon stays in the Dynamax form
2494000	2497000	and so you all basically fight this Pokemon together.
2497000	2499000	I believe I heard things about NPCs
2499000	2501000	if you don't have the friends to play with or what have you.
2501000	2503000	So that sounds kind of neat, though.
2503000	2505000	It's a neat little different co-op angle
2505000	2509000	and I think it's really cool that you see how Pokemon Go's influence now.
2509000	2511000	And then also kind of like with Let's Go,
2511000	2514000	they also have it where you can see the Pokemon on the map
2514000	2516000	instead of just running into them randomly.
2516000	2518000	Yeah. And then let's see.
2518000	2521000	New characters, new gyms.
2521000	2523000	They showed a character named Leon,
2523000	2527000	a burly blue-haired man that is apparently a celebrity, of course,
2527000	2530000	and has Charizard following in a lot of places.
2530000	2533000	So they showed several characters and there's already,
2533000	2536000	like Milo was one of the characters, a grass-type gym leader,
2536000	2540000	and I've already seen fan art for Milo that I can't unsee.
2540000	2543000	You don't follow the same Twitter accounts I do.
2543000	2546000	Hi, Loki. I've seen things.
2549000	2551000	Then they, of course, announced the release date.
2551000	2555000	November 15th, 2019 is the global release day
2555000	2557000	and they showed the mythical Pokemon.
2557000	2559000	I'm probably going to mispronounce these, sorry.
2559000	2563000	Zacian and Zamazenta were shown there
2563000	2566000	and they were shown in a little fight, fighting each other.
2566000	2568000	I liked Zamazenta a little better
2568000	2570000	because it actually has the shield face
2570000	2572000	and I just thought the color scheme was a little...
2572000	2575000	Yeah, so I think I might be a little more Pokemon Shield,
2575000	2578000	but I want to hear a little closer to the date
2578000	2581000	all the Pokemon that are exclusive in one game versus the other
2581000	2583000	because I'm sure there will be a bit of a list,
2583000	2586000	but I'm sure lots of people are going to be picking up this game,
2586000	2588000	both types.
2588000	2592000	And knowing my buddy Shane, who I saw in chat already,
2592000	2595000	he's probably going to buy 17 copies of the game anyway,
2595000	2598000	so I won't have a problem trading for whatever Pokemon I need.
2598000	2601000	And he's already correcting me. Legendary, not mythical, my bad.
2601000	2603000	I thought I said legendary,
2603000	2606000	but there's just so many Pokemon to be excited about.
2606000	2608000	So, you're not showing...
2608000	2610000	More excitement about Pokemon, Loki.
2610000	2611000	Are you going to pick it up?
2611000	2612000	Maybe, I don't know.
2612000	2613000	I will, for sure.
2613000	2615000	I'm excited about a mainline game on the Switch.
2615000	2616000	I really am.
2616000	2618000	I haven't played any of the mainline games, so I don't know.
2618000	2620000	Really? You should fix that.
2620000	2622000	Alright.
2622000	2624000	S2100matt in chat says,
2624000	2626000	The dual pack with both games is a lame deal.
2626000	2628000	120 for both games.
2628000	2630000	You get better deals if you buy them individually from retailers.
2630000	2633000	Some are offering $10 credit for pre-ordering.
2633000	2636000	Shad Starzik or Shane in our chat is following that up,
2636000	2639000	saying they will probably add something to sweeten the deal,
2639000	2642000	like bonus items in game or something.
2642000	2643000	Maybe a Steelbook.
2643000	2644000	Yeah.
2644000	2645000	Or a shiny...
2645000	2646000	What do you want to bet?
2646000	2647000	Get shiny Pikachu...
2647000	2649000	I don't know, I'm pulling some dumb ass.
2649000	2650000	Get shiny XYZ...
2650000	2654000	Shiny Wooloo for buying the combo kit or something like that.
2654000	2656000	Maybe that'll be a thing.
2656000	2659000	Somebody's going to be mad I spoke that into existence, but sorry.
2659000	2661000	Mistake Theory says,
2661000	2664000	I always get the second game, so I'm in for shield.
2664000	2666000	That's an interesting way to do it.
2666000	2668000	Always get the second game listed.
2668000	2669000	So red and blue.
2669000	2670000	X and Y.
2670000	2672000	Kind of an interesting way to do it. I like that.
2672000	2673000	Alright.
2673000	2675000	Let's move on to Stadia.
2675000	2676000	Let's talk about Google Stadia.
2676000	2677000	You want to talk about Stadia, Loki?
2677000	2679000	I know you've been keeping an ear on the Bethesda thing,
2679000	2680000	but they just finished, right?
2680000	2681000	Yeah.
2681000	2683000	I didn't really watch the Stadia event.
2683000	2685000	I just read the press stuff.
2685000	2688000	So basically they talked a little bit about the service
2688000	2691000	and everything, what the requirements would be, and pricing, all that stuff.
2691000	2693000	So Stadia is going to launch in November,
2693000	2696000	and they have it in 14 different countries.
2696000	2701000	They said right now they're shooting for 31 games from 21 publishers.
2701000	2705000	They have this Founders Edition that's $130,
2705000	2708000	which includes the Stadia controller.
2708000	2712000	I think one of the Google...
2712000	2713000	I forget.
2713000	2715000	The Chromecast type thing.
2715000	2719000	And then they've also got three months of the Stadia Pro service.
2719000	2725000	And then I think there's also three months of Stadia Pro for a friend as well,
2725000	2727000	which is interesting.
2727000	2729000	That's a clever idea, John.
2729000	2733000	And then of course some of the games that they are mentioning
2733000	2734000	were beyond the service.
2734000	2737000	So from Bethesda, for example, they have Doom Eternal,
2737000	2741000	Doom 2016, Rage 2, The Elder Scrolls Online,
2741000	2743000	Wolfenstein Youngblood,
2743000	2745000	Bungie has Destiny 2,
2745000	2748000	they've got Thumper on there,
2748000	2750000	Metro Exodus, Grid,
2750000	2753000	Farming Simulator 19,
2753000	2757000	Square Enix's Final Fantasy XV,
2757000	2759000	Tomb Raider Definitive Edition,
2759000	2760000	Rise of the Tomb Raider,
2760000	2761000	Shadow of the Tomb Raider,
2761000	2764000	2K's got NBA 2K, Borderlands 3,
2764000	2766000	Mortal Kombat 11 is going to be in there,
2766000	2768000	lots of Ubisoft games.
2768000	2771000	So it's got a pretty good selection of titles.
2771000	2774000	But it's not Netflix.
2774000	2775000	It's not Netflix.
2775000	2777000	So that Google, that Stadia Pro,
2777000	2778000	so what that is,
2778000	2781000	that allows you to do the 4K streaming at 60 frames per second,
2781000	2785000	and then you also get the surround sound along with that.
2785000	2788000	There's going to be free games with it,
2788000	2790000	so I would think like...
2790000	2792000	PlayStation Plus is kind of nice.
2792000	2793000	Yeah, PlayStation Plus or something like that.
2793000	2795000	Destiny 2 is confirmed to be one of those.
2795000	2798000	But no, you do not get the whole library for free.
2798000	2801000	There is a mode if you don't want to do 4K streaming,
2801000	2803000	you can do 1080p streaming for free.
2803000	2806000	And it's only in stereo as well.
2806000	2808000	But apparently, you know,
2808000	2812000	the requirements that you need to actually stream that,
2812000	2814000	so it's I think 35 megabits down
2814000	2816000	if you want to do the 4K streaming,
2816000	2821000	and then anywhere from I think 10 to get the 720p.
2821000	2823000	And then of course, as Bobby's mentioned,
2823000	2826000	and as it's on of all our minds,
2826000	2829000	that's going to eat through your data cap so fast.
2829000	2832000	With the 4K streaming, you can get 60 hours out of it,
2832000	2834000	I believe some of the math has been said,
2834000	2836000	before you hit one terabyte.
2836000	2839000	Now, you know, this will be a question I think for cable companies to answer as well.
2839000	2842000	I don't want to necessarily like, you know,
2842000	2845000	shoot Google in the foot and say this thing is terrible
2845000	2848000	because, you know, bandwidth caps and so forth.
2848000	2849000	I see they're trying to get out in front of it.
2849000	2853000	I mean, it is inevitable, bandwidth caps will raise
2853000	2855000	because they've risen before.
2855000	2858000	As we rely more and more on the internet and so forth,
2858000	2861000	the market is going to force those bandwidth caps to raise.
2861000	2862000	It's just a question of when.
2862000	2864000	I don't know if it's going to be later this year.
2864000	2865000	In fact, I highly doubt it.
2865000	2868000	So people are going to have to budget that a little bit
2868000	2870000	if they plan to do 4K gaming.
2870000	2873000	But I don't know about you, Loki, I don't have a 4K TV.
2873000	2876000	So if I were to go get a Chromecast and put that and so forth,
2876000	2878000	I wouldn't be doing it anyway.
2878000	2882000	But I'm a little more, when it comes to Google Stadia,
2882000	2884000	like, I want to like it.
2884000	2886000	There's things about it I do like.
2886000	2888000	I think the controller is kind of neat.
2888000	2889000	I like this whole concept.
2889000	2890000	If you can pick it up everywhere.
2890000	2896000	I just don't like the idea of paying $60 for this game that,
2896000	2900000	that's kind of where I think where a lot of the on-live jokes come from, right?
2900000	2903000	Is that you bought this game full price online
2903000	2905000	and you don't really own it
2905000	2908000	because heaven forbid Google Stadia ever go away.
2908000	2913000	And Google has sunsetted many of their products.
2913000	2920000	Pour one out for Google Plus or Google Buzz or Google Wave or, right?
2920000	2923000	So there's, you know, a lot of Google stuff sometimes gets sunsetted.
2923000	2927000	But at the same time, I don't want to like shit on this and say it's terrible.
2927000	2928000	I don't think it's terrible.
2928000	2932000	I just feel like, oh, I just wish they'd opted for a different,
2932000	2935000	like I wish they would try to strengthen, you know,
2935000	2937000	especially now that Microsoft's kind of put out this,
2937000	2939000	this ultimate game pass.
2939000	2942000	I'm like, well, here's, here's, here's a perfect comparison.
2942000	2946000	OK, so we're talking Stadia versus Microsoft's offering.
2946000	2951000	So like I have a modern day PC and I'm willing to pay $10 a month.
2951000	2955000	I can either get Stadia Plus and I can stream games to that.
2955000	2958000	But I don't get any sort of game library with that.
2958000	2962000	Or I could pay $10 a month and go the Microsoft Games Pass route.
2962000	2964000	And I have a library of hundreds of games
2964000	2967000	that are constantly getting brand new games added in it.
2967000	2971000	Why would I want to pay for $10 a month to do 4K streaming for...
2973000	2975000	I just don't, it doesn't make any sense.
2976000	2980000	I feel like this, I know it's gonna be a weird thing to say
2980000	2982000	because I know Google feels like they have to be competitive.
2982000	2985000	I know they feel like they want to get in front, out in front of this
2985000	2986000	because this is where the industry is going.
2986000	2988000	And I think that is all correct.
2988000	2991000	I think they are launching this one year too soon.
2992000	2996000	Because I think if they'd waited to be able to maybe respond a little more
2996000	2998000	to what now Microsoft is doing on this side
2998000	3001000	and maybe wait to see if some of the 4K streaming
3001000	3004000	is only going to get bigger and bigger on Netflix and Amazon Prime.
3004000	3007000	Maybe that's going to start the conversation about bandwidth caps and so forth.
3007000	3010000	I just kind of feel like this is almost one year too soon.
3010000	3013000	But to be fair, I'm going to raise the counterpoint
3013000	3015000	a lot of you are probably thinking about right now.
3015000	3019000	Stadia kind of isn't really launching fully this year anyway.
3020000	3022000	It's only on that Chromecast.
3022000	3024000	It's a very limited thing.
3024000	3027000	And to be fair, Stadia doesn't require a powerful PC to run.
3027000	3029000	It's just streaming.
3029000	3033000	Whereas the Microsoft stuff is running on your PC hardware.
3033000	3036000	But they're also going to have their Microsoft cloud service saying that
3036000	3040000	I don't know how that's going to play into it once that launches.
3040000	3043000	But for me, I have what I have.
3043000	3047000	And so I'm not really interested in Stadia in that sense
3047000	3050000	because I don't need another system to play Destiny 2 on.
3050000	3055000	I have Destiny 2 on several systems and I don't play it.
3055000	3057000	Stadia might do really well.
3057000	3060000	I'm going to be fair because, again, I don't want to shit on what Google's doing
3060000	3064000	because there are little pieces in here that I really like
3064000	3066000	and I want to see them succeed.
3066000	3070000	So I hope at least maybe Google's opening to maybe shifting this around a little bit.
3070000	3072000	Maybe if they learn some things from this launch and so forth.
3072000	3077000	But where I do think Google stands to do very well
3077000	3082000	is in countries that don't always get supported very well
3082000	3085000	by Sony, Microsoft, Nintendo,
3085000	3088000	which I know is ironic because Stadia is only launching in 14 countries.
3088000	3094000	I know it's also ironic because other countries only have so much limited access to Internet.
3094000	3099000	But I still think there might be enough places in the world where at least the 1080p streaming,
3099000	3102000	which, let's be real, for most people is going to be good enough.
3102000	3104000	And some of you are talking about this in chat as well,
3104000	3108000	is that if you don't have a TV of a certain size, 4K isn't going to do much for you anyway.
3108000	3114000	So for a lot of people, 1080p is going to be good enough for now.
3114000	3119000	So there may be a lot of parts of the world where consoles aren't as easy to come by
3119000	3122000	where maybe Stadia may be a more attractive alternative.
3122000	3127000	But again, it just depends on, well, if the consoles aren't easy to come by, how's the Internet infrastructure?
3127000	3130000	It just depends on what country we're talking about.
3130000	3133000	Anyway, now mistake theory points out.
3133000	3135000	I don't think it's too little too late.
3135000	3140000	If it works really well and keeps getting games, all four go a next-gen system.
3140000	3143000	And I was in the Assassin's Creed test and I loved it.
3143000	3148000	And I will say, a lot of people that were in that test, I don't hear negative things about it.
3148000	3151000	A lot of people that were in that saying, yeah, it was responsive, it played very well,
3151000	3154000	it was a very impressive piece of technology.
3154000	3156000	So I think we need to all keep that in mind.
3156000	3161000	I think one thing Google really needs to do when they come out the gate in 2020
3161000	3169000	is they need to have not just that free, but they need to sprinkle in a few free games just to get you hooked.
3169000	3175000	And if I'm not mistaken, didn't Destiny 2, didn't they announce the base Destiny 2 package to be free for everybody anyway?
3175000	3176000	They did.
3176000	3177000	Okay.
3177000	3180000	Destiny 2 in the first year of DLC that was for it.
3180000	3182000	Okay. So there you go.
3182000	3187000	Why doesn't Stadia just give the Destiny 2 thing for the free level people, that base thing you just mentioned,
3187000	3190000	for the free level people so that people can get a taste of it, people can sample it.
3190000	3192000	Because maybe it'll win me over.
3192000	3197000	If I get my hands on it and I play it on my shitty old laptop and it runs really well, I might be like, oh, this is kind of cool.
3197000	3199000	Well, and that's the other thing too.
3199000	3203000	They showed off some games, I want to say, that may have multiplayer in them.
3203000	3206000	Do I have to buy two of these controllers to do that?
3206000	3207000	I mean...
3208000	3212000	Probably, but you could also probably have one person on controller, one person on keyboard and mouse.
3212000	3215000	It'll work with other controllers, won't it? Didn't they show the other one on?
3215000	3219000	It does, but the best controller because it connects directly to the Wi-Fi or something.
3219000	3220000	Right.
3220000	3222000	Like there's going to be that much latency, I don't know.
3222000	3224000	Alright, whatever.
3224000	3226000	Alright, to be continued.
3226000	3230000	And then we got to Bethesda, which was wrapping up as our show started tonight.
3230000	3236000	So if Loki seemed a little distracted, he kind of had one ear on the Bethesda thing while that was going on.
3237000	3239000	Because I don't even know everything they talked about.
3239000	3242000	They didn't talk about much. In fact, I'm going to just try to see if I can pull up on her.
3242000	3244000	Well, our expectations were kind of low, right?
3244000	3246000	It was very low.
3246000	3248000	No, they weren't going to show any of that.
3248000	3249000	They said that.
3249000	3253000	So yeah, basically it was the same type of stuff you would expect that they would show.
3253000	3262000	So they talked a little bit about Fallout 76 and that there's going to be a brand new set of content coming out for that free.
3262000	3264000	So they have, for example...
3264000	3265000	Battle Royale!
3265000	3268000	Yes, there's this nuclear winter mode called Battle Royale.
3268000	3270000	It's a 52 player Battle Royale game.
3270000	3272000	Didn't they also kind of apologize for Fallout 76?
3272000	3277000	They did. They did apologize that they'd received lots of critique.
3277000	3286000	There's a brand new free update called Wastelanders that's going to have human NPC characters as well with full dialogue trees.
3286000	3289000	A new main quest that's coming out this fall.
3289000	3293000	And then apparently if you want to try Fallout 76, you can do that.
3293000	3298000	They have a free week or so that's from the 10th through the 17th or 16th?
3298000	3301000	Yeah, the 17th. So you can try it out then.
3301000	3307000	Elder Scrolls Blades is coming to Switch and no one gave a shit.
3307000	3313000	They have the Elder Scrolls Legends, which is going to be the next expansion for that.
3313000	3315000	It's called Moons of Elsewhere.
3315000	3322000	They also have Elder Scrolls Online dungeon DLC called Scalebreaker.
3322000	3329000	They showed off a little bit of Wolfenstein Cyberpilot, which is a VR game coming in July.
3329000	3336000	A game that I was excited for when they originally were showing this trailer, Commander Keen.
3336000	3338000	That's pretty cool. Commander Keen's back.
3338000	3341000	It's pretty cool. It's a 2D side scrolling game.
3341000	3348000	It is unfortunately a mobile title and it looks like it's just...
3348000	3352000	I'll hope they had it for it just like right down the tube.
3352000	3354000	Choices.
3354000	3358000	Rage 2 is getting an expansion called Rise of the Ghosts.
3358000	3363000	They also talked about this new software technology for game streaming called Orion.
3363000	3368000	That's something that I guess is developing and they're implementing at the engine level
3368000	3372000	that lets game streams with much lower latency.
3372000	3376000	It's supposed to help stream games at max settings.
3376000	3379000	This is something they're looking to implement in things like Starfield.
3379000	3385000	I think maybe stuff that they're looking to implement with Stadia games and stuff like that.
3385000	3387000	Because they do have stuff coming on there.
3387000	3392000	Deathloop is another game that's coming out by...
3392000	3395000	I think it's... was it Arcade Lion?
3395000	3397000	What is it?
3397000	3402000	It looks like an action game but it's a time loop type thing.
3402000	3404000	I'm not really sure what it was based on the trailer.
3404000	3407000	It just showed two people fighting each other.
3407000	3413000	And then they had Ghostwire Tokyo which was another game that was teased.
3413000	3415000	It looked kind of interesting.
3415000	3422000	And then of course they showed off Doom Eternal and it looks amazing.
3422000	3424000	Did they date it?
3424000	3427000	They did. It was November 22nd I think.
3427000	3428000	It's in November.
3428000	3430000	Cool.
3430000	3434000	Yeah, the Doom reboot was so good so I'm happy to hear it.
3434000	3437000	They also have a multiplayer mode called Battle Mode.
3437000	3438000	It's two players...
3438000	3439000	Battle Royale mode?
3439000	3444000	Two players control a demon versus one player who's Doom guy.
3444000	3447000	Okay. Oh, interesting.
3447000	3448000	Yeah, so...
3448000	3451000	So it's like Pac-Man versus but Doom.
3451000	3453000	I kind of like that. That's cool.
3453000	3455000	So yeah, neat.
3455000	3457000	But yeah, nothing unexpected really.
3457000	3459000	Nothing surprising.
3459000	3460000	Just kind of standard fare.
3460000	3461000	Okay.
3461000	3464000	Well, I think we knew it was going to be more...
3464000	3467000	And in general, it's a break.
3467000	3471000	This is the last year of the current gen before we bring on the next gen.
3471000	3478000	And I imagine things like Starfield, Elder Scrolls VI are almost assuredly the next gen systems at this point.
3478000	3479000	Oh yeah.
3479000	3480000	Very interesting to see.
3480000	3484000	I think next year's E3 is going to be quite a show I bet.
3484000	3490000	Anyway, usually we do this a little more towards the top of the show but with all the E3 hype tonight,
3490000	3492000	we wanted to get all that news out of the way.
3492000	3495000	A little bit of a different flow for E3.
3495000	3499000	Next week's show will be the same thing because this time next week we're only part way through E3.
3499000	3503000	So still to come, we have the PC Gaming Conference.
3503000	3505000	Your favorite is going to be tomorrow.
3505000	3507000	Devolver is going on right now.
3507000	3510000	They're saying it's a Nintendo Direct parody apparently.
3510000	3512000	I can't wait.
3512000	3513000	Hoot and a holler.
3513000	3516000	We'll try to get the bullet points on that before the show is out tonight.
3516000	3519000	But I'm sure you'll watch the whole thing later if it's that funny.
3519000	3522000	But we also know Nintendo is a huge deal.
3522000	3523000	People are waiting for that.
3523000	3524000	That's Tuesday.
3524000	3525000	Intellivision.
3525000	3527000	Amico is apparently showing...
3527000	3531000	Bobby gave us the tea at the end of his show that they're doing something behind closed doors tomorrow.
3531000	3534000	We don't know if it's going to be embargoed or not, but we may get some details on that.
3534000	3537000	Maybe behind closed doors and not get the information out.
3537000	3539000	Well, it may be embargoed until a certain date.
3539000	3541000	They may not want it all.
3541000	3542000	They may be showing people.
3542000	3544000	They may be trying to get buyers.
3544000	3546000	You know that from your world that you used to be in.
3546000	3549000	Maybe they're trying to get the buyers and the shelf space basically.
3549000	3553000	They want to show people to get the shelf space at Target and things like that.
3553000	3555000	And maybe the press to some extent.
3555000	3557000	But maybe they don't want their news being lost in E3 weeks.
3557000	3558000	They might embargo it until later.
3558000	3559000	Who knows?
3559000	3560000	We don't know.
3560000	3561000	We don't know.
3561000	3562000	We might see everything tomorrow.
3562000	3563000	We don't know.
3563000	3564000	Square Enix is going to be tomorrow.
3564000	3566000	And actually, here, I'll plug right now.
3566000	3570000	Here at Twitch.tv slash VOG Network, you can actually check out.
3570000	3573000	Bobby Blackwolf and I are bringing a special spinoff show tomorrow.
3573000	3576000	We're going to live react to the Square Enix conference.
3576000	3580000	The thing we always said we don't understand why people do these.
3580000	3584000	We've heard from enough people that have said things akin to,
3584000	3589000	God, I wish I could have seen Rob when they announced Phantasy Star on Line 2.
3589000	3591000	So, all right.
3591000	3594000	Square Enix, I know, is not maybe the one you want to see us react to.
3594000	3598000	But the reality is we hold day jobs, the 9 to 5 type of thing.
3598000	3602000	So, Square Enix is in the right time slot for us to do.
3602000	3604000	So, we'll do a react tomorrow for Square Enix.
3604000	3606000	Ubisoft and...
3606000	3607000	Ubisoft is still coming up.
3607000	3609000	And the PC show...
3609000	3610000	Nintendo.
3610000	3611000	Nintendo on Tuesday.
3611000	3612000	Yeah.
3612000	3614000	So, I feel like I'm missing somebody.
3614000	3616000	There's probably more stuff during the week, too.
3616000	3619000	Like, there's always the Treehouse Live stuff that they always show more things.
3619000	3621000	They might give a little bit there, too.
3621000	3623000	Is Sony doing any sort of, like, streaming stuff?
3623000	3625000	Like, I don't know.
3625000	3628000	No, we don't think Sony has any type of response.
3628000	3630000	Or they're relying on third parties to carry them through.
3630000	3632000	So, we don't know. We don't know.
3632000	3634000	And Bobby is saying in chat about the Intellivision.
3634000	3636000	It's not embargoed.
3636000	3638000	They just don't have a booth.
3638000	3640000	And they have a meeting room, which is cheaper.
3640000	3644000	And they're only booking by appointment is basically what it is.
3644000	3646000	So, very cool.
3646000	3647000	All right.
3647000	3649000	Let's get into our gaming weeks.
3649000	3651000	So, the types of video games that we have been playing this week.
3651000	3653000	Usually, we would have done this earlier in the show.
3653000	3655000	But, you know, it's going crazy around here.
3655000	3657000	Well, I've got unfortunate news.
3657000	3659000	I haven't played anything this week.
3659000	3661000	I played a little bit of Pokemon Go.
3661000	3663000	So, I was just busy.
3663000	3665000	It was a very stressful week.
3665000	3667000	Yeah, didn't play anything.
3667000	3669000	I played a little bit.
3669000	3672000	I played, you know, Pokemon Go had Community Day yesterday.
3672000	3674000	And I was really distracted.
3674000	3676000	I wasn't able to play a ton
3676000	3678000	because I was out, you know,
3678000	3680000	Pride was going on here locally this weekend.
3680000	3682000	Which, by the way, on a Pride tangent real quick,
3682000	3685000	happy Pride to everybody that's celebrating.
3685000	3688000	And also, I should point out a little shout-out
3688000	3690000	because I've already seen this happen in our chat.
3690000	3692000	And I do want to say thank you, thank you.
3692000	3695000	Twitch is running a cute little Pride promotion right now
3695000	3697000	where there are special emotes.
3697000	3700000	And if you cheer at least 200 biddies with one of those emotes,
3700000	3702000	and it's all there in the biddies thing,
3702000	3706000	then you actually enable extra emotes for random chatters.
3706000	3709000	For example, SheHulk10 just did one.
3709000	3710000	Thank you, thank you.
3710000	3713000	And I got a little Pride lion out of it in chat.
3713000	3714000	So, it's kind of cool.
3714000	3717000	Like, if you do cheers, you're actually giving our chatters
3717000	3718000	emote icon gifts.
3718000	3720000	So, that's really cool.
3720000	3722000	So, thank you to everybody that's participating in that.
3722000	3725000	I'll read off the names of the donators a little later on in the show.
3725000	3727000	But I do want to say thank you.
3727000	3729000	Oh, and what's also very important about that
3729000	3731000	is that Twitch is actually making,
3731000	3733000	I believe a percentage of that,
3733000	3735000	it's a small percentage, but it is a percentage,
3735000	3737000	is going to the Trevor Project,
3737000	3740000	which is a great charity for LGBTQ+.
3740000	3742000	So, great. Fantastic.
3742000	3744000	And thank you, Twitch, for supporting that.
3744000	3746000	Anyway, okay, so, sorry.
3746000	3749000	MikeyMeweek was distracted with Pride, Pokemon Go,
3749000	3753000	but I did catch four shinies of the pink slakoths.
3753000	3755000	And for not really playing, that's pretty good.
3755000	3757000	So, I'll take it.
3757000	3760000	And I played a lot of Diablo III.
3760000	3763000	That's really been my go-to clicky click party game.
3763000	3766000	I'm up to Paragon 170.
3766000	3768000	I've played a lot. I've done a lot of rifts.
3768000	3771000	I've leveled gems up to 25, gotten the extra abilities.
3771000	3773000	So, I'm enjoying that, playing my wizard.
3773000	3775000	Also been playing a little bit of Heroes of the Storm,
3775000	3779000	Final Fantasy XIV, because the expansion is only like three weeks away.
3779000	3782000	And so, there's a lot of hype, or early access is only like three weeks away.
3782000	3784000	So, there's a lot of hype going into Shadowbringers
3784000	3785000	in the next expansion of Final Fantasy XIV.
3785000	3787000	So, I'm really excited about that.
3787000	3789000	And been watching some stuff on Twitch,
3789000	3791000	but otherwise, as far as playing other stuff,
3791000	3795000	I haven't really sat down with any other games in depth this week.
3795000	3797000	And stream. I was playing a little more and stream.
3797000	3799000	And some of the streamable stuff on there.
3799000	3802000	But too many games I was sampling the list off.
3802000	3808000	But they're not going to add any more games to and stream during early access.
3808000	3811000	They've kind of said, you know, early access is just this list,
3811000	3814000	and then we are going to add.
3814000	3817000	They said they're going to add games on a regular basis,
3817000	3820000	but they don't want to say, we're going to add five games every Thursday.
3820000	3822000	They don't want to beholden themselves to a schedule.
3822000	3825000	They say, we're going to release games when they're done,
3825000	3827000	but there will be a fair amount, basically.
3827000	3829000	But they did add new challenges.
3829000	3831000	So, they added a few more challenges.
3831000	3833000	That's kind of nice to see them still doing that.
3833000	3835000	So, very, very cool.
3835000	3837000	So, yeah.
3837000	3839000	That was really it for my gaming week.
3839000	3843000	So, I think with that, we've got plenty more news to come
3843000	3845000	a little later on in the show here.
3845000	3847000	So, let's get to the Classic Game of the Week.
3847000	3850000	Dark Soccer is not here tonight, so you know what that means.
3850000	3851000	I invited on a guest this week.
3851000	3852000	So, you ready to get to it?
3852000	3855000	Yes, let's get to it.
3855000	3858000	And so, we're going to take a trip down memory lane
3858000	3861000	to a segment that we call the Classic Game of the Week.
3861000	3864000	And usually, Dark Soccer or Jamie Summers,
3864000	3867000	she steps into the gaming vault and finds a game that she thinks,
3867000	3870000	hey, you guys should be checking out this game this week.
3870000	3872000	But, as I mentioned earlier in the program,
3872000	3874000	Dark Soccer is not going to be able to make the show tonight.
3874000	3877000	So, as we've been doing lately when Jamie's unavailable,
3877000	3880000	we've been inviting some special guests on the show to help us fill in.
3880000	3882000	So, helping us fill in on tonight's program,
3882000	3888000	please welcome back to the show a podcaster and a regular streamer.
3888000	3891000	Welcome back, Delvin, Video Game Realness.
3891000	3892000	Hello.
3892000	3893000	Hello, everybody.
3893000	3894000	Hi, welcome back.
3894000	3897000	It's been a few months since we had you here live.
3897000	3898000	It's been a moment.
3898000	3900000	It's been a hot minute.
3900000	3902000	So, let's get to it.
3902000	3904000	I have a lot I want to talk to you about,
3904000	3906000	but specifically, this segment is the Classic Game of the Week.
3906000	3908000	So, let's get into it.
3908000	3909000	You know the drill.
3909000	3910000	We're going to pick a game
3910000	3912000	and we're going to spotlight that game this week.
3912000	3915000	So, I said you can pick pretty much any game you want
3915000	3918000	except this list of 500 games we've already done.
3918000	3923000	So, what did you pick for the Classic Game of the Week this week?
3923000	3926000	Well, I went through the list and I had two options
3926000	3929000	and I was actually surprised that this one that I chose was not on the list.
3929000	3932000	It's Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles for the NES.
3932000	3934000	Oh, good pick. Good pick.
3934000	3936000	Tiger Claw is screaming somewhere.
3936000	3938000	He's a big Ninja Turtles fan.
3938000	3939000	No, this is great.
3939000	3940000	So, tell us about it.
3940000	3943000	Well, so I'm a huge Ninja Turtles fan myself.
3943000	3946000	I was obsessed with Ninja Turtles as a child.
3946000	3951000	Like, if you could name any type of Ninja Turtles paraphernalia
3951000	3953000	that existed back then,
3953000	3958000	whether it be pencils, the figurines, the blimp,
3958000	3962000	April O'Neil, the communicators, shoes, binders,
3962000	3965000	everything Ninja Turtles related, I had it.
3965000	3966000	So...
3966000	3968000	Binders full of turtles?
3968000	3970000	Yes.
3970000	3974000	So, there was natural extension that when this game was available,
3974000	3976000	my parents got it for me.
3976000	3978000	Well, actually, technically, no, my parents didn't get it for me.
3978000	3982000	So, I live in Canada and I have an aunt that lives in the US
3982000	3985000	and games were significantly cheaper in the US.
3985000	3989000	So, my aunt had bought, like, eight games for us
3989000	3991000	and she sent them to us.
3991000	3993000	And so, this was one of the games that she bought for us
3993000	3995000	because, of course, she knew that I liked Ninja Turtles.
3995000	4001000	So, this game was released in 1989
4001000	4008000	and is a side-scrolling platform game with an overhead overworld.
4008000	4010000	So, you kind of go over in the overworld
4010000	4013000	and then there's, like, sewers that you go into for each level.
4013000	4016000	And, of course, it stars the four Ninja Turtles, Leonardo,
4016000	4018000	Raphael, Michelangelo, Donatello,
4018000	4021000	and they all feature their special weapons
4021000	4024000	with varying different power and speed.
4024000	4028000	So, Leonardo is kind of your all-around average guy.
4028000	4031000	Raphael is quick, but very weak,
4031000	4035000	but good at eliminating small mobs.
4035000	4038000	Michelangelo is kind of your, again, all-around,
4038000	4041000	and Donatello is slow, but his is the most powerful weapon.
4041000	4047000	So, the storyline of the game is very much what you can expect from a NES game.
4047000	4049000	There is very little storyline,
4049000	4054000	but the storyline follows very much the Ninja Turtles arc
4054000	4058000	where you're trying to battle Shredder.
4058000	4063000	He has a weapon that can turn Master Splinter back into a human.
4063000	4064000	So, they're trying to get that back,
4064000	4068000	and the game starts out with you having to rescue April O'Neil,
4068000	4071000	and you go through and rescue April O'Neil,
4071000	4072000	and then you find out,
4072000	4074000	oh, you have to go do something else,
4074000	4076000	and while you're going to do that,
4076000	4078000	oh, Master Splinter gets kidnapped,
4078000	4080000	and then you have to go save him,
4080000	4082000	and then you go into the beach Shredder.
4082000	4088000	So, it is an overworld game,
4088000	4090000	and you go through different levels,
4090000	4093000	just traversing, trying to find where the end level is,
4093000	4095000	because it starts out pretty simple
4096000	4099000	where there's only certain worlds that you can go into,
4099000	4102000	but once you start to get into the later parts of the game,
4102000	4105000	there's a whole bunch of levels that are pretty much optional.
4105000	4107000	You don't even have to do them.
4107000	4110000	So, it's kind of an adventure in that sense
4110000	4112000	where you have to kind of figure out where it is that you need to go,
4112000	4115000	but there are little things that you can pick up along the way
4115000	4117000	to make the journey a bit easier for you.
4117000	4124000	So, they do have special weapons that the Ninja Turtles can get.
4125000	4131000	As on-use weapons, and they come in the quantity of 20 usually.
4131000	4133000	So, they have the Ninja Stars,
4133000	4136000	they have triple Ninja Stars, Boomerangs,
4136000	4138000	and the almighty Scrolls.
4138000	4141000	The Scrolls are the best item to get in the game.
4141000	4145000	It's especially handy for beating bosses.
4145000	4151000	So, there's some world levels that have those Scrolls,
4151000	4152000	and generally when you're playing it,
4152000	4155000	you want to stock up all your Turtles with it
4155000	4160000	because each of the four can have one of the special weapons.
4160000	4162000	So, you can kind of mix it up,
4162000	4167000	but the thing is some levels have them predetermined as to where they are,
4167000	4169000	and then sometimes you'll go through a level
4169000	4172000	and then one of these special weapons will just show up,
4172000	4175000	and if you walk right into the item, you end up losing it.
4175000	4177000	So, that was one of the caveats of the game
4177000	4179000	where you'd stock up on Scrolls
4179000	4182000	so that you could make the bosses easier when you got to them,
4182000	4185000	but you had to be very careful as you were going through levels
4185000	4191000	to make sure not to accidentally pick up basic Boomerangs
4191000	4194000	because they're not as powerful as the Scrolls.
4194000	4198000	So, anyway, as you go throughout the game,
4198000	4201000	this is a very, very hard game,
4201000	4204000	and I was never able to beat it.
4204000	4208000	Until back then, what happened was,
4208000	4213000	so my parents bought me this videotape, VHS tape, that had...
4213000	4214000	Oh, wow.
4214000	4218000	Yeah, because Game Facts wasn't a thing.
4218000	4220000	There was no internets.
4220000	4222000	There was no internet.
4222000	4229000	And the strategy guides existed,
4229000	4232000	but it was really only for the really popular games,
4232000	4237000	so like your Marios, your Zeldas, Ninja Gaiden, those type of games.
4237000	4241000	The really popular ones were the ones that were getting strategy guides made
4241000	4243000	in Nintendo Power and stuff like that.
4243000	4246000	And a strategy guide is not going to get you the timing
4246000	4248000	on that infuriating damn stage
4248000	4252000	where you're trying to disarm the bombs and all that stuff.
4252000	4254000	The strategy guides aren't going to show you.
4254000	4256000	I don't even want to talk about the damn stage, okay?
4256000	4258000	No pun intended.
4258000	4261000	I believe it's showing on the screen right now, but that's all right.
4261000	4263000	Yeah, like...
4263000	4265000	It's a notorious part of the game.
4265000	4270000	This level is horrible, because it has seaweed in certain sections,
4270000	4274000	and the seaweed kind of pulls you in as a current.
4274000	4278000	So it's hard to swim in certain sections, and there's lightning,
4278000	4281000	and it's just a very horrible, horrible level.
4281000	4284000	I still have PTSD over it.
4284000	4289000	So the tape was a complete playthrough,
4289000	4291000	pretty much like what you would see on YouTube now,
4291000	4293000	but on a VHS tape back then,
4293000	4297000	and this guy narrated how to get through the game,
4297000	4300000	what levels you should go into to kind of get the scrolls,
4300000	4303000	the best ways to beat certain levels,
4303000	4305000	because the later on you progress through the game,
4305000	4308000	once you get into the tectodrome,
4308000	4310000	the tectodrome is insane,
4310000	4315000	and you start to also get limited amounts of pizza,
4315000	4318000	which is what is used to regenerate your life.
4318000	4322000	So you start getting less of that as you progress through the game,
4322000	4324000	and then even if you want to get some,
4324000	4327000	you have to kind of go to a far part of the stage
4327000	4329000	to even get pizza to rejuvenate it.
4329000	4332000	So the game just becomes increasingly harder that way,
4332000	4335000	and then you technically don't have any lives.
4335000	4339000	Your lives are the Ninja Turtles.
4339000	4342000	So the Ninja Turtles can die,
4342000	4345000	and then you can go to a certain level and rescue them,
4345000	4346000	because they get captured.
4346000	4348000	They don't necessarily die,
4348000	4352000	but if all four of the turtles get captured, that's it.
4352000	4354000	You have to basically continue.
4354000	4356000	I think you get two continues
4356000	4359000	before you have to start all over again from the beginning.
4359000	4362000	So it is a very hard game.
4362000	4370000	So one of the things I was actually looking up for this game
4370000	4372000	to talk about this today
4372000	4375000	was the regional differences of the game.
4375000	4379000	So the game was released for the Famicom in Japan
4379000	4381000	a few months earlier than the American NES version
4381000	4384000	under the name Geki Kame Ninja Den,
4384000	4388000	which loosely translates to Legend of the Radical Ninja Turtles.
4388000	4391000	And this was the first Ninja Turtles product released in the country,
4391000	4396000	predating the Japanese dub of both the first film and the animated series.
4396000	4399000	And subsequent Ninja Turtles games released in Japan
4399000	4401000	kept the franchise original title.
4401000	4404000	And while graphics and gameplay are virtually identical,
4404000	4408000	the Japanese localization changed the plot by turning April O'Neil
4408000	4411000	from an acquaintance of the turtles to Splinter's daughter.
4411000	4416000	So it's such a random change to make
4416000	4419000	that they would make April Splinter's daughter,
4419000	4425000	but especially because the game doesn't really have that much dialogue
4425000	4428000	that would really be able to convey that.
4428000	4430000	So it's interesting that they would have changed the dialogue
4430000	4434000	to actually convey, oh, this is Splinter's daughter.
4434000	4436000	So I just found that was...
4436000	4438000	Exploring Splinter turning into a human,
4438000	4440000	that was something I don't remember ever being addressed.
4440000	4443000	I mean, it's been a long time, and I don't follow the series as closely
4443000	4445000	as some of the rest of you, but I seem to remember
4445000	4448000	that was kind of an angle unique to the game, right?
4448000	4451000	Or did they explore that in one of the movies or something?
4451000	4454000	Yeah, they did in the first or second movie?
4454000	4456000	Oh, shit. Shows you how much I remember.
4456000	4457000	I can't recall.
4457000	4461000	Yeah, because they go into the history of how Splinter and Shredder
4461000	4465000	know each other and all that stuff.
4465000	4466000	I will have to...
4466000	4469000	The movie I saw more than any of them was the third one
4469000	4471000	when they went back to feudal Japan and all that stuff.
4471000	4472000	But anyway, I digress.
4472000	4473000	Oh, that's the worst movie.
4473000	4475000	I know, right?
4475000	4477000	You need to watch the first and the second one.
4477000	4480000	Those are the ones you definitely have to watch.
4480000	4483000	And then also, so the game was released
4483000	4487000	as Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles in all the European territories.
4487000	4491000	So that's another little side tidbit there.
4491000	4496000	But yeah, this game, it does not like all the other Ninja Turtle games
4496000	4500000	that we've come to know for Ninja Turtles games
4500000	4502000	as the side-scroll and beat-em-up games
4502000	4504000	where you can play up to four players.
4504000	4508000	The one that came after this was Ninja Turtles the arcade game
4508000	4510000	and was completely different from this.
4510000	4512000	It wasn't any of the overworld stuff.
4512000	4516000	It was just your straightforward side-scrolling adventure.
4516000	4519000	None of this driving in a turtle van all over the city
4519000	4522000	to find where Master Splinter is in all these different levels.
4522000	4524000	It was just straightforward.
4524000	4526000	You went from point A to point B,
4526000	4528000	but this one was a little bit different.
4528000	4533000	Kind of almost, I want to say, open world, but not.
4533000	4535000	For NES.
4535000	4539000	Right, for NES, it was what you could probably consider open world
4539000	4542000	and also one of the other things that it had was
4542000	4545000	randomly generated levels.
4545000	4548000	Well, not levels, but I would say the enemies that would show up
4548000	4552000	whenever you entered the level were not always exact.
4552000	4557000	So if you left a stage and re-entered, the enemies could change.
4557000	4561000	And sometimes the type of enemies that you got would change mid-level.
4561000	4566000	So there's generally a grouping of enemies that would be paired together
4566000	4568000	and sometimes they would just randomly change.
4568000	4572000	Mid-level, and it would never be consistent.
4572000	4579000	You know what game I'm kind of reminded of with the Konami and Ultra sort of games
4579000	4583000	where you have the overworld but then you go into these side stages and so forth?
4583000	4585000	Metal Gear was kind of like that, in a way.
4585000	4588000	Absolutely, I was actually going to bring that up.
4588000	4592000	So this game, yes, was developed by Konami and then, of course,
4592000	4596000	published under the name Ultra Games
4596000	4601000	because Nintendo had a whole rule back then where publishers were limited
4601000	4607000	to how many games they could publish under their brand per year.
4607000	4611000	So Konami jumped that or beat that by having all these different companies,
4611000	4613000	Ultra Games being one of them.
4613000	4618000	And so Metal Gear was also in this type of similar style with the overworld
4618000	4620000	and then you going into certain levels.
4620000	4623000	So probably was developed by the same team.
4623000	4628000	I didn't look that up before doing this,
4628000	4634000	but it's a good chance that it was developed by a similar team that did this game.
4634000	4639000	So yeah, Ninja Turtles for the Nintendo Entertainment System.
4639000	4642000	And what a catchy soundtrack the game had too, for sure.
4642000	4646000	Oh yeah, I absolutely love the soundtrack in this game.
4646000	4651000	Even though it's NES and you don't expect amazing soundtracks,
4651000	4656000	but it was very, very catchy, the music that they did have in the game.
4656000	4660000	Yeah, despite the fact that the game is notoriously difficult,
4660000	4663000	I think elements like that, the fact that it was a mixture
4663000	4666000	of these different genres all at once, a little bit,
4666000	4668000	and then the great music and all that stuff.
4668000	4673000	I know that's why I remember the game as opposed to the arcade game,
4673000	4676000	which is this whole other thing.
4676000	4683000	Yeah, there's actually also a Ninja Turtles game,
4683000	4685000	Fall of the Foot Clan for Game Boy,
4685000	4690000	that is kind of similar in this style of level,
4690000	4692000	but didn't have an overworld.
4692000	4696000	So the levels were kind of similar to how it is in this Ninja Turtles
4696000	4700000	versus the arcade games, but again, there was no overworld.
4700000	4703000	So it was just straightforward going through different levels.
4703000	4707000	And in doing research to try to grab footage for the classic games,
4707000	4709000	and I never realized this before,
4709000	4713000	but they had ported this NES game to Commodore 64,
4713000	4717000	the ZX Spectrum, and there was a DOS version as well
4717000	4719000	that apparently had a game-breaking bug in it.
4719000	4721000	It was kind of crazy.
4721000	4724000	Yeah, I was even unaware of that myself.
4724000	4728000	But yeah, this game has been around for a while.
4728000	4733000	It made its hops around the early generation of consoles
4733000	4735000	that were around back then,
4735000	4738000	but of course, most people remember it being on the NES.
4738000	4739000	Yeah.
4739000	4741000	Okay, so we're going to head back to the studio live
4741000	4743000	because we have a lot of E3 ground to cover still tonight.
4743000	4745000	But before we do that,
4745000	4749000	I want to quickly allow you a chance to plug your streaming on Twitch
4749000	4751000	if people are not already following.
4751000	4752000	Absolutely.
4752000	4756000	You can catch me at twitch.tv slash vgrealness
4756000	4760000	where I occasionally stream whatever games I'm currently playing at the time,
4760000	4765000	and right now I'm currently replaying Final Fantasy X on the Switch.
4765000	4767000	And I have to ask you about this before we get back
4767000	4771000	because something that you and I were co-streaming a little bit.
4771000	4773000	I know you took a little break from streaming for a couple months,
4773000	4776000	and honestly, I've been really bad about it too on my personal channel.
4776000	4778000	But you and I were doing a few streams
4778000	4781000	where we were playing through Phantasy Star Online
4781000	4783000	on a private server together.
4783000	4784000	Correct.
4784000	4787000	And I have to ask, I'm sure we've talked about this in the studio by now,
4787000	4792000	but Delvin, Phantasy Star Online 2 for the Xbox,
4792000	4796000	it's happening in the States and Canada, of course,
4796000	4798000	and North American regions.
4798000	4800000	What was your reaction?
4800000	4803000	I'm not going to lie, I cried.
4805000	4807000	So when the trailer came on,
4807000	4811000	I immediately, because Phantasy Star Online
4811000	4814000	is one of those games where the soundtrack
4814000	4819000	is so memorable, so identifiable,
4819000	4823000	I knew exactly what it was before they even finished.
4823000	4825000	I knew it was Phantasy Star and I was like,
4825000	4827000	oh my God, is it actually happening?
4827000	4830000	I was like having a moment and like breaking down,
4830000	4832000	but I was so happy.
4832000	4834000	There was definitely a part of me that like,
4834000	4835000	I think my overwhelming,
4835000	4837000	and I probably already talked about this in the show,
4837000	4838000	so I don't want to repeat myself too much,
4838000	4840000	but I think my overwhelming reaction was fucking finally.
4840000	4842000	But kind of like with that, there's also that part of me,
4842000	4844000	it's like, no, I still don't believe it.
4844000	4846000	I still don't believe that they're doing this.
4846000	4847000	I know, right?
4847000	4849000	There's still a little bit of me that it's like,
4849000	4850000	is this actually happening?
4850000	4852000	Like, is this a joke?
4852000	4853000	Yeah, for sure, for sure.
4853000	4855000	All right, I had to get your opinion on that.
4855000	4858000	But thank you so much, Delvin, for joining us tonight
4858000	4859000	for the classic game of the week.
4859000	4862000	Have a fantastic week and we'll catch you
4862000	4864000	on your Twitch channel soon, okay?
4864000	4866000	Thank you so much and thanks for having me.
4866000	4867000	You are welcome.
4867000	4869000	Now let's go back to the studio.
4869000	4871000	All right, thanks so much to Delvin for joining us
4871000	4873000	for the classic game of the week.
4873000	4874000	I appreciate you having him on.
4874000	4876000	And if you aren't already following VGRealness
4876000	4878000	here on Twitter, you should do that.
4878000	4881000	We're back here with episode number 779,
4881000	4882000	already in progress for tonight.
4882000	4883000	I don't think I ever said the episode number
4883000	4884000	at the top of the show.
4884000	4885000	I was too busy crying.
4885000	4887000	Or as you start online, too.
4887000	4889000	So welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio,
4889000	4894000	episode number 779 for this June the 9th,
4895000	4900000	or 6-9, nice, of 2019.
4900000	4902000	And, of course, E3 week already underway.
4902000	4904000	If you're just joining us, you unfortunately missed
4904000	4907000	us already recapping the Microsoft event
4907000	4910000	and the EA Play and Google Stadia,
4910000	4912000	kind of all the stuff that we've addressed so far.
4912000	4914000	And, of course, in seven days next Sunday
4914000	4916000	we'll be back here live to talk about Nintendo
4916000	4919000	and Square Enix and television and whatever else
4919000	4922000	shows up on the floor at E3.
4922000	4924000	Sadly, not attending the show in person this year.
4924000	4926000	It's been a little while since we've been able
4926000	4927000	to attend the show in person.
4927000	4929000	But, I mean, now the way it is,
4929000	4930000	I feel like you just kind of get everything
4930000	4933000	on YouTube anyway, and then Twitch and all that stuff.
4933000	4938000	So I really feel like we're best kept to having
4938000	4940000	a forum to talk about those types of things
4940000	4943000	and discuss the things that are getting us excited.
4943000	4945000	Because, you know, for, again, what is a year
4945000	4947000	that's kind of supposed to be all that lull
4947000	4949000	before the next generation of games,
4949000	4951000	there's still a lot of stuff to get excited about,
4951000	4954000	even on Sony's end, you know, for not having gone
4954000	4955000	to E3 this year.
4955000	4958000	You know, we did talk about, well, if they showed up
4958000	4960000	at E3, they'd probably be talking about a lot
4960000	4961000	of the same stuff they have been.
4961000	4964000	But that doesn't make The Last of Us 2
4964000	4966000	or Death Stranding or any of the stuff they have
4966000	4967000	in the pipeline any less exciting.
4967000	4968000	Dreams.
4968000	4969000	I'm still psyched about that game.
4969000	4970000	Yeah, it should be really good.
4970000	4971000	Yeah, it should be really good.
4971000	4973000	Anyway, we're going to pick up and do some more
4973000	4974000	rapid-fire news.
4974000	4976000	And, of course, later on in the show we'll be taking
4976000	4979000	your phone calls at our Discord.
4979000	4981000	If you are not already on our Discord,
4981000	4983000	you should get there over at vognetwork.com.
4983000	4987000	That's vognetwork.com slash Discord.
4987000	4988000	Let's get into some rapid-fire news.
4988000	4991000	Well, if you're hoping to play Shenmue 3 this year,
4991000	4993000	you'll still get a chance to do that.
4993000	4994000	It'll still be later on in the year.
4994000	4997000	So originally it was supposed to be slated for August 2019.
4997000	4999000	It's now coming out in November.
4999000	5001000	November 19th is the new date for it.
5001000	5005000	And on their Kickstarter page,
5005000	5007000	Yu Suzuki said,
5021000	5024000	I'm fine with them taking more time on it.
5024000	5025000	Take the time to get it right, right?
5025000	5026000	Exactly.
5026000	5028000	Now, this is kind of interesting.
5028000	5030000	I'm unaware of this type of party game coming out,
5030000	5034000	but apparently they're making a game called Burger Time Party.
5034000	5035000	That's right.
5035000	5039000	They're taking the classic Data East arcade classic game
5039000	5042000	and turning it into a party game.
5042000	5045000	So apparently you have to build, of course,
5045000	5047000	the hamburgers much like the original game,
5047000	5050000	but now it's a little bit more competitive.
5050000	5051000	Oh, like Mario Party?
5051000	5054000	Like can you steal the lettuce from other players?
5054000	5055000	I don't know.
5055000	5056000	I'm looking at this.
5056000	5057000	Is it going to be that crazy like Mario Party?
5057000	5058000	Screenshots.
5058000	5061000	I mean, it just looks like Burger Time.
5061000	5063000	It honestly does.
5063000	5064000	We'll only need to see it in motion.
5064000	5066000	Maybe we'll get some more information later on.
5066000	5067000	Yeah.
5067000	5069000	Are they going to have Impossible Burgers in there as well?
5069000	5070000	Or like, you know, the...
5070000	5071000	Perhaps.
5071000	5072000	Perhaps it very well might be.
5072000	5074000	Because, you know, we've got to be current and everything.
5074000	5075000	Yeah.
5075000	5076000	All right.
5076000	5079000	Well, let's move on and talk about a game that
5079000	5081000	I think a lot of you have played at this point,
5081000	5082000	but it's one of those games where it's like,
5082000	5084000	hey, it's finally getting a Switch port,
5084000	5087000	and that game is Dream Daddy.
5087000	5088000	Loki, I know you're a big fan.
5088000	5089000	No, I'm just kidding.
5089000	5090000	I don't think he's ever played it.
5090000	5091000	I have not played this game.
5091000	5093000	I actually haven't played it either,
5093000	5096000	even though I dressed up as one of the characters.
5096000	5098000	I did Brian, the one that has a little corgi,
5098000	5099000	because he also has like a beard thing.
5099000	5102000	I dressed up at Dragon Con as him once,
5102000	5104000	and like maybe three people.
5104000	5105000	Three people.
5105000	5106000	Thousands of people go to Dragon Con.
5106000	5108000	Three people knew what the hell I was doing.
5108000	5109000	But you know what?
5109000	5110000	For those three people, shout out.
5110000	5113000	Anyway, Dream Daddy is coming out for the Nintendo Switch.
5113000	5115000	It's also coming out for iOS and Android.
5115000	5118000	So Dream Daddy, all the things.
5118000	5120000	No official release date yet,
5120000	5122000	but just confirmation that it's coming.
5122000	5124000	Happy Pride, I suppose.
5124000	5127000	And also, not soon, but now,
5127000	5130000	pretty cool news for Final Fantasy fans.
5130000	5132000	All the Final Fantasy soundtracks.
5132000	5134000	Well, I have heard a few are missing,
5134000	5135000	but for the most part,
5135000	5138000	a big chunk of those Final Fantasy soundtracks,
5138000	5140000	I know like all the ones for XIV
5140000	5142000	and like the Final Fantasy XIV music is great.
5142000	5145000	Anyway, all those soundtracks on Spotify and Apple Music now.
5145000	5148000	So if you are, you know, paying for those music services,
5148000	5151000	you should think about getting on there and stream the music.
5151000	5152000	Good times.
5153000	5154000	Alright.
5154000	5156000	That's it for rapid fire news.
5156000	5157000	Let's travel around the world
5157000	5159000	and check out what is coming out in stores this week.
5159000	5161000	Not a whole lot of stuff coming out over here,
5161000	5165000	but we've got Battle Worlds Kronos on Nintendo Switch.
5165000	5169000	We have The House in Fata Morgana,
5169000	5172000	Dream of the Revalence Edition,
5172000	5174000	and that's on PlayStation 4.
5174000	5178000	Doraemon, Nubita's Story of Seasons,
5178000	5180000	that's on Nintendo Switch.
5180000	5182000	And last but not least,
5182000	5185000	Blaster Master Zero on PC.
5185000	5187000	Oh, that's cool that that's coming to PC.
5187000	5189000	I remember hearing that that is happening.
5189000	5191000	So, of course, that was the Switch game.
5191000	5194000	That's a really cool little, I guess, reinterpretation.
5194000	5196000	I don't even know if you'd call it like a remaster
5196000	5197000	because it's like different,
5197000	5199000	but like a reinterpretation of the original Blaster Master game.
5199000	5200000	Yeah.
5200000	5202000	A little on the easy side compared to the original,
5202000	5205000	but as I get older and worse at video games, that's okay.
5205000	5208000	So, I'm there for it.
5208000	5210000	Let's travel to Japan.
5210000	5212000	Coming out in Japan this week,
5212000	5215000	let's see, I think the release day over there is,
5215000	5217000	I don't know if we actually have a lot.
5217000	5220000	I want to see one game on June 13th for the PlayStation 4.
5220000	5224000	Yumi Utsutsu Remaster coming out in Japan this week
5224000	5226000	on the PlayStation 4,
5226000	5229000	and checking the Nintendo Switch to see if there's anything there.
5229000	5231000	Doraemon, Story of Seasons,
5231000	5233000	that seems to be the big release from Bandai Namco this week,
5233000	5236000	a new Doraemon game on the Nintendo Switch over in Japan.
5236000	5238000	Dark Sakura has the night off if you're just joining us.
5238000	5242000	She had a conflict with the Pride events and some other stuff,
5242000	5244000	some other personal obligations she had.
5244000	5246000	So, Loki, do we have the UK dates available?
5246000	5248000	Yeah, not a whole lot coming out there as well.
5248000	5251000	We have Kingdom Come Deliverance Royal Edition.
5251000	5254000	That's on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
5254000	5258000	We have Leisure Suit Larry, Wet Dreams Don't Dry
5258000	5260000	on PlayStation 4 and the Switch.
5260000	5265000	Warhammer Vermitide 2 Deluxe Edition on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
5265000	5269000	World End Syndrome on PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch.
5269000	5270000	And that's it.
5270000	5272000	All right.
5272000	5274000	So, for our next segment, we're going to get into your emails.
5274000	5276000	Every week we invite you to send us emails.
5276000	5278000	Participate at orangelandtrader.com.
5278000	5280000	It's the place where you can send us an email,
5280000	5282000	and we read our favorite emails here on the show.
5282000	5285000	We usually read them all unless it's like spam
5285000	5287000	or something, I don't know, totally weird,
5287000	5288000	or really long.
5288000	5290000	We might have to abbreviate them a little bit
5290000	5292000	if they're really long.
5292000	5294000	But we are going to get to the mailbag this week.
5294000	5296000	We got one email, so I'll read it,
5296000	5298000	and I think this actually was meant for last week,
5298000	5300000	but it got in after the cutoff,
5300000	5302000	because, you know, we actually opened the mailbag
5302000	5304000	a little bit before showtime.
5304000	5305000	So, I think this got in a little late,
5305000	5306000	but I'll read it now.
5306000	5309000	It's a short one, the email this week from Elliot,
5309000	5311000	one of our pals who's sent us emails before
5311000	5314000	and used to do some stuff at vognetwork.com.
5314000	5316000	And he has moved on to much bigger and better things.
5316000	5318000	I'm very happy for him, congratulations.
5318000	5321000	Not to shade ourselves, which I think I just did,
5321000	5323000	but no, if I told you what he did now,
5323000	5325000	you'd be like, oh, that was bigger and better things.
5325000	5328000	Anyway, Elliot writes, hey, OLR, writing this fast
5328000	5331000	so I make it in for the June 2nd show.
5331000	5334000	After years of flirting with game dev,
5334000	5337000	I'm finally getting into it, but it's bloody hard.
5337000	5339000	I'm a web developer in my day job,
5339000	5341000	and this is 10 times harder.
5341000	5344000	Just makes you appreciate the technical wizardry
5344000	5347000	of professionally released games even more.
5347000	5348000	And that's from Elliot.
5348000	5350000	You know, kind of also a good reminder tonight.
5350000	5353000	Well, first off, Loki ought to know how hard it is
5353000	5355000	to make a game, because he's never finished one.
5355000	5357000	Yes, that's true.
5357000	5360000	But, I mean, it also kind of goes to show,
5360000	5362000	if somebody's like thinking about making a game,
5362000	5364000	what are some good resources for them to start?
5364000	5366000	Like, there's a lot of good YouTube tutorials out there.
5366000	5367000	The internet.
5367000	5369000	The internet, yeah, it's a wide, wonderful internet.
5369000	5372000	A lot of these modern development platforms
5372000	5374000	really good, have a lot of tutorials.
5374000	5375000	Yeah, I mean, any of them.
5375000	5377000	Like, if you pick Unity or Unreal,
5377000	5379000	they've got a lot of different tutorials out there
5379000	5380000	on how to do stuff.
5380000	5381000	Yeah.
5381000	5383000	I know Unity has a ton of stuff.
5383000	5385000	I've gone through a little bit of the Unreal stuff.
5385000	5388000	The Unreal tutorials, like the official ones that they have,
5388000	5390000	not all that helpful.
5390000	5393000	They're kind of, it's weird how they have them set up,
5393000	5395000	but there's a lot of like independent stuff out there
5395000	5396000	that you can find.
5396000	5398000	There's tutorials and everything out there,
5398000	5401000	so you just pick your subject and you can find something.
5401000	5404000	Bobby Blackwolf in our chat at twitch.tv slash vog network says,
5404000	5407000	what resources should they go to so they can finish a game?
5407000	5410000	There's a lot about starting, but not about finishing.
5410000	5411000	That is a problem.
5411000	5414000	If Loki knew, maybe we wouldn't make fun of him so much.
5416000	5417000	But, no, that's true.
5417000	5418000	Finishing is a...
5418000	5419000	Well, finishing a game,
5419000	5422000	first thing that you want to do is make sure you don't have a family,
5422000	5424000	and you're not going to have a family.
5424000	5426000	What you want to do is make sure you don't have a family,
5426000	5429000	and that you're not working a full-time job.
5429000	5430000	Stop.
5430000	5431000	No, I honestly...
5431000	5433000	Well, here's the piece of advice I've always heard
5433000	5435000	that you have flat-out rejected,
5435000	5438000	and that is to start with a game that you already know.
5438000	5441000	Make Pong, and then put your spin on it.
5441000	5443000	Make, I don't know, make...
5443000	5444000	What are other like...
5444000	5446000	Breakout, make Breakout, put your spin on it.
5446000	5447000	Make Kaboom.
5447000	5450000	Pick an Atari 2600 game, remake it, put your spin on it.
5450000	5451000	Type it in.
5451000	5453000	You don't even have to necessarily do that,
5453000	5458000	but it's like even just following along with some of these tutorials and stuff,
5458000	5461000	it'll help you with coding,
5461000	5464000	because a lot of them, especially some of the ones I do,
5464000	5465000	they kind of give you like,
5465000	5467000	okay, here, we're doing a bunch of stuff.
5467000	5469000	Okay, now we're going to have you pause the video,
5469000	5472000	and you figure out how to do this.
5472000	5474000	And then when you're done, unpause it,
5474000	5476000	and then if you can't figure it out, you just watch it,
5476000	5479000	and it'll kind of help you try to figure out what to do
5479000	5480000	based on what you've learned already.
5480000	5483000	And doing some of those will help you kind of get back into the swing of things.
5483000	5486000	Like, I hadn't been coding in Unity for a long time,
5486000	5489000	so I went through one of those tutorials just to build a game.
5491000	5493000	Yes, there is a finished game I have.
5493000	5496000	No, it's not mine, because it's a Unity tutorial, so that doesn't count.
5499000	5501000	But it got me back into kind of like,
5501000	5504000	oh, okay, here's how all the syntax works again,
5504000	5506000	and I kind of forgot how this was,
5506000	5508000	and here's how I do these things.
5508000	5510000	And then, of course, as you're going along,
5510000	5512000	especially when you're starting out,
5512000	5514000	you're just going to not know how to do something,
5514000	5515000	or can't figure something out.
5515000	5518000	You just search it, Google, stack social.
5519000	5521000	And if you even want to take it a little bit easier
5521000	5525000	to just be able to create something, to kind of have an outlet,
5525000	5528000	like, you know, your oldest kid, eight years old, right,
5528000	5530000	is doing coding or learning how to do games.
5530000	5532000	Scratch, yeah. You can do Scratch. That's free.
5532000	5535000	So there's also very elementary platforms.
5536000	5538000	Or ZZT, my always favorite.
5538000	5542000	But no, seriously, making a little big planet level
5542000	5546000	and making a good one will be a lot about how to make a game.
5546000	5548000	It's not everything, but it's a lot of, you know,
5548000	5551000	if you have the patience to finish a really good little big planet level,
5551000	5553000	it's a start.
5553000	5555000	And there's a lot of stuff out there that is free.
5555000	5558000	Unity is free. Unreal Engine is free.
5559000	5562000	I'm not sure, but I think that there's even a
5563000	5565000	game maker version that's free.
5565000	5567000	There's a lot of free versions of things out there.
5567000	5570000	You can try it out and see if that's going to be a good fit for you.
5570000	5573000	And if that engine doesn't work for you, then try something else.
5573000	5578000	Yeah, and some of those, like, Steam, you know, sold game creation platforms,
5578000	5581000	like, there are really games that have been made on those, right?
5581000	5582000	Like Five Nights at Freddy's was what?
5582000	5584000	Click Studio? Was that a...
5584000	5585000	I don't know.
5585000	5587000	Sorry, guys, I don't remember which did which.
5587000	5590000	But I know, like, Five Nights at Freddy's was made for one of those type of engines.
5590000	5593000	So, and obviously that game has done very well for itself.
5593000	5595000	Yeah, I mean, there's lots of things out there.
5595000	5598000	Click Team Fusion. I knew Bobby would correct me.
5598000	5600000	Love having a live chat.
5600000	5603000	But yeah, I mean, and a lot of times, like, Humble Bundle will do, like,
5603000	5606000	a thing of, you know, game maker packs and stuff like that,
5606000	5608000	where you can get Game Maker Studio for, like, dirt cheap.
5608000	5610000	Which Bobby points out Undertale was a game maker game.
5610000	5611000	Yeah.
5612000	5615000	And then AkumaJP, also giving advice.
5615000	5618000	I know he's had his fair share of how to make games.
5618000	5621000	AkumaJP says, just get a free project and play with it.
5621000	5622000	That's the fastest.
5622000	5625000	Yes, they always come with a free project.
5625000	5627000	Just play with that. You'll learn a lot in no time.
5627000	5629000	So that's a good suggestion as well.
5629000	5631000	So lots of great suggestions about how to do it.
5631000	5634000	Which I know is, like, totally not what Elliot was, like, really asking.
5634000	5637000	But I think also just kind of encouraging people to see what kind of goes into it.
5637000	5639000	I think it also...
5639000	5641000	I always...
5641000	5644000	You know, when people are super critical about games, right?
5644000	5646000	Like, this game looks like garbage.
5646000	5653000	Which is so easy to say in a tweet or on a forum post or in the comments section of YouTube.
5653000	5656000	Being able to say a game is garbage is so easy to do.
5656000	5661000	But, like, if you really know, like, what goes into making a game,
5661000	5665000	I think you start to go away from that perspective of garbage game
5665000	5669000	and more the perspective of, hmm, doesn't look like my cup of tea,
5669000	5671000	but it's neat that they did this.
5671000	5673000	Or at least, oh, somebody put together this game, looks cool.
5673000	5677000	You know, maybe this is some constructive feedback I have on how to make it better.
5677000	5679000	I think it really does kind of change your perspective a little bit.
5679000	5683000	Because unfortunately, if you grew up watching, you know, G4TV or TechTV,
5683000	5685000	you probably remember that commercial about,
5685000	5688000	here, you should go to school and learn how to make games.
5688000	5691000	And that dude's sitting there going, let's turn up the graphics on level three.
5691000	5695000	He turns up and he's like, that is not fucking real at all.
5695000	5697000	You all know that. Just to make sure you all know that.
5697000	5699000	That's not fucking real.
5699000	5700000	The commercial's not fucking real.
5700000	5703000	But they have a lot of, like, even community colleges and stuff.
5703000	5706000	A lot of them have game-making tracks and stuff like that that you can do.
5706000	5710000	Don't do any of the online colleges, or not the online colleges,
5710000	5714000	but the game institute I wouldn't necessarily recommend.
5714000	5717000	I've actually done that before just to see what that was like.
5717000	5720000	And no, their stuff's pretty dated.
5720000	5722000	Plus, you can find a lot of it separately.
5722000	5725000	Udemy has a lot of decent ones you can find,
5725000	5728000	especially when they go dirt cheap and everything.
5729000	5731000	But a lot of that stuff's even on YouTube.
5731000	5733000	YouTube has tons of tutorials out there.
5733000	5737000	Unity, Unreal, they all do official tutorials for their stuff.
5737000	5739000	Unity's pretty good about doing that,
5739000	5744000	and they do them every year during their conferences that they do.
5744000	5747000	And they always go over the new features that they have,
5747000	5749000	so that's always good to stay on top of all that stuff.
5749000	5750000	Because sometimes it's hard to figure out,
5750000	5752000	especially when you haven't worked in it in a while,
5752000	5755000	they've changed so much that how you used to do something
5755000	5757000	isn't the way you do it anymore.
5758000	5760000	Just a lot of different...
5760000	5761000	You may want to learn,
5761000	5765000	how do I make this type of thing happen?
5765000	5767000	Like a driving game or something like that.
5767000	5769000	It can get kind of complicated if you want to mimic
5769000	5771000	some of the things that are out there.
5771000	5774000	But yeah, just experiment.
5774000	5777000	Don't try to overscope.
5777000	5780000	It's hard to say not to do that, but you know.
5780000	5782000	Take your own advice. I'm just kidding.
5782000	5783000	I try.
5783000	5785000	Props to those that are trying to get into it.
5785000	5786000	So thank you so much for the email.
5786000	5788000	Please send us more emails.
5788000	5790000	Participate at orangelauntradio.com.
5790000	5793000	Before we get to our next story, we have breaking news.
5793000	5795000	And this is where I need a button for the breaking news,
5795000	5797000	like the graphic.
5797000	5799000	So that's something for me to work on during E3.
5799000	5800000	Breaking news.
5800000	5801000	Apparently there has been a leak.
5801000	5803000	This one's pretty major.
5803000	5806000	GameSpot accidentally posted an article early.
5806000	5808000	Must have dated the day wrong.
5808000	5810000	You know, one of those automated pusher things.
5810000	5812000	Whoopsie doopsie.
5812000	5814000	Apparently the article says,
5814000	5817000	Final Fantasy VII Remake releasing this winter.
5817000	5822000	So it is a Quarter 4 2019 or Quarter 1 2020.
5822000	5825000	Remember, winter doesn't necessarily mean before Christmas.
5825000	5827000	It just means it could be a January, February game.
5827000	5829000	Final Fantasy VII Remake releasing this winter.
5829000	5833000	Apparently the little headline on the article said,
5833000	5835000	Winter is coming.
5835000	5837000	So you know what that means, right?
5837000	5839000	And apparently the article also confirmed
5839000	5842000	it is a PlayStation 4 exclusive.
5842000	5844000	And apparently there is a release date reveal
5844000	5846000	to happen at the concert.
5846000	5848000	I guess this concert that they were doing,
5848000	5851000	it was supposed to be the time of the big reveal for that.
5851000	5852000	So there it is.
5852000	5854000	That is just breaking.
5854000	5857000	Apparently an article went up and then it was pulled.
5857000	5859000	But of course once on the internet,
5859000	5861000	somebody copy pasted it and put it on a reset era
5861000	5863000	and then it's all over Twitter at this point.
5863000	5865000	So there you go.
5865000	5866000	There it is.
5866000	5867000	Winter is spoiled.
5867000	5868000	Bobby Blackwell says,
5868000	5870000	So I guess our co-stream is canceled, Rob.
5870000	5872000	No, because they're still going to show off footage and so forth.
5872000	5874000	And we can act surprised at the news.
5874000	5876000	We can go, what?
5876000	5880000	I mean, is it surprising that Final Fantasy VII Remake is this winter?
5880000	5882000	No.
5882000	5884000	I don't think so either.
5884000	5888000	It's dangerous if they don't, if they go out much further
5888000	5892000	because hello, next year's conversation is going to be about PlayStation 5
5892000	5894000	and the next Xbox.
5894000	5897000	So I think the longer they wait to do it,
5897000	5899000	they're going to be in a little more danger.
5899000	5901000	Take the time to get it right.
5901000	5903000	I mean, don't get me wrong,
5903000	5908000	but the unfortunate part of that is if they wait too long,
5908000	5910000	then they're going to push it back to the next console,
5910000	5913000	which I think will be a whole other thing going on there.
5913000	5914000	So anyway.
5914000	5917000	From what I hear, though, the concert sucked.
5917000	5919000	Oh, that's too bad.
5919000	5921000	You know what, though?
5921000	5925000	I went to, so Jason and I, Jason, our voiceover guy,
5925000	5928000	and I went to Dear Friends, the first E3 I ever went to.
5928000	5931000	And it was like the first Final Fantasy concert in the States.
5931000	5934000	That was, what, 2004, I think it was, in L.A., was the first E3.
5934000	5936000	That concert was great.
5936000	5939000	The next year, we went to More Friends,
5939000	5942000	which was at a different venue, which, to put it in perspective,
5942000	5946000	that venue has since been bulldozed and turned into Harry Potter World.
5946000	5949000	Fact, that is true statement.
5949000	5951000	Gibson, Gibson, whatever.
5951000	5953000	They turned into Harry Potter World.
5953000	5955000	That was the More Friends concert.
5955000	5957000	That More Friends concert, not good.
5957000	5958000	Well, this one, they said, it says,
5958000	5960000	we're at the final, this is a tweet there,
5960000	5962000	we're at the Final Fantasy VII concert, it's a legit scam,
5962000	5965000	two-thirds of it has been them playing the MIDI from the game.
5965000	5968000	They didn't say anywhere in the advertising that the orchestra
5968000	5971000	would be sitting in pure silence, wasting everyone's time,
5971000	5974000	as they're literally playing fucking MIDI.
5974000	5976000	Oh, dear.
5976000	5978000	Oh, dear.
5978000	5981000	I hope, oh, gosh, that does not sound good.
5981000	5983000	I'll be curious for more information on that.
5983000	5984000	But anyway, we're gonna move on.
5984000	5987000	We do have some more news that's outside of just the press conferences
5987000	5988000	we've been talking about so far.
5988000	5991000	There's more news showing up this week, so, Loki.
5991000	5994000	So they've got a new Yooka-Laylee trailer that's out now
5994000	5998000	for a brand new game, Yooka-Laylee and the Impossible Lair,
5998000	6000000	and it looks pretty cool.
6000000	6003000	It's kind of the same style as Donkey Kong Country.
6003000	6010000	It's a pure side-scroller as opposed to a kind of 3D platform game.
6010000	6013000	Awesome, because I think Donkey Kong Country is awesome,
6013000	6015000	and I would love to see that sort of thing make a comeback.
6015000	6020000	Yes, I know Tropical Freeze was a thing, but I'd be curious.
6020000	6024000	It looks cool. I mean, I'd be willing to check this out, so neat.
6024000	6026000	Yeah, very cool.
6026000	6028000	Are they doing a Kickstarter for it, or is it just happening?
6028000	6029000	I think it's just happening.
6029000	6031000	That's cool.
6031000	6036000	All right, well, moving on to some sources and things
6036000	6038000	that are coming out of Blizzard.
6038000	6042000	Blizzard has apparently cancelled a StarCraft first-person shooter.
6042000	6045000	This first-person shooter was in development over the last two years.
6045000	6050000	It has apparently been confirmed by Kotaku with three people
6050000	6053000	in the studio familiar with what's going on.
6053000	6057000	The reason for this, Blizzard is taking those resources
6057000	6060000	and putting them into Diablo and Overwatch.
6060000	6065000	So the inevitable Diablo 4, which we know will be a thing eventually,
6065000	6069000	not on mobile phones, and some sort of Overwatch 2,
6069000	6072000	of which I know there's a lot of rumors that Overwatch 2
6072000	6078000	is going to take a PvE element to it as well as the PvP,
6078000	6080000	although obviously this is not a story about Overwatch 2,
6080000	6084000	but we have heard a little bit of the rumble, rumble, rumble for that.
6084000	6087000	The new StarCraft game was codenamed Ares.
6087000	6091000	It was supposed to be a battlefield game in the StarCraft universe.
6091000	6095000	It sounds like the Overwatch engine may have been leveraged
6095000	6098000	in making this game, which is a pretty smart idea, right?
6098000	6100000	Why not take this first-person shooter over here?
6100000	6102000	Why not take the engine to make this own thing?
6102000	6105000	So battlefield in the StarCraft universe, that would have been kind of rad, probably.
6105000	6107000	But unfortunately, I guess it didn't happen.
6107000	6111000	Apparently, folks were shocked within Blizzard that this game got canceled
6111000	6113000	because apparently it was looking pretty good.
6113000	6115000	Here's the interesting thing.
6115000	6118000	Kotaku reached out to Blizzard for comment.
6118000	6122000	99% of the time when you contact these companies for comment, what do you get?
6122000	6124000	We don't comment on rumors and speculation, right?
6124000	6126000	That's not what Kotaku got back.
6126000	6129000	Blizzard said, we don't generally comment on unannounced projects,
6129000	6131000	but we will say the following.
6131000	6134000	We always have people on different ideas behind the scenes,
6134000	6137000	including multiple projects right now, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
6137000	6140000	We pour our heart and souls into this work, and as players ourselves,
6140000	6144000	we know how exciting it can be to see and know with certainty
6144000	6146000	that a new project is coming.
6146000	6148000	Knowing that changes or disappointments can happen
6148000	6151000	doesn't make it any less painful when we have to shelve a project
6151000	6153000	or when an announcement doesn't go as planned.
6153000	6155000	Why are they saying this if it ain't true?
6155000	6158000	Yeah, it's a little bit more than we don't comment on rumors.
6158000	6159000	Yeah, a little more than that, right?
6159000	6160000	Et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
6160000	6163000	With all that said, we're very much looking forward to revealing other things
6163000	6166000	we're working on when the time is right,
6166000	6169000	which brings me to why this cancellation is your fault.
6169000	6172000	Not you specifically, but gamers.
6172000	6173000	So here's the thing.
6173000	6177000	Now, granted, the game may have actually been messy on the inside.
6177000	6178000	I don't know.
6178000	6181000	But I think the important thing about this is that those resources
6181000	6184000	were shifted to Diablo and Overwatch,
6184000	6188000	and that is because after that negative reception
6188000	6190000	that they got from the last BlizzCon,
6190000	6193000	which is in big part Blizzard's own fault
6193000	6195000	and Activision's fault, I'm sure, as well,
6195000	6200000	but I think after the internet collectively dragged them through the mud
6200000	6203000	for not having a new Diablo game and so on,
6203000	6206000	it is imperative at Blizzard,
6206000	6208000	and this is how they got to fix that BlizzCon.
6208000	6209000	It is imperative.
6209000	6211000	It is priority number one at Blizzard right now,
6211000	6216000	I'm speculating, that Diablo 4 fucking happens at this BlizzCon,
6216000	6219000	and it came at this cost,
6219000	6222000	because they needed the resources in order to have Diablo 4
6222000	6225000	something that you can see at this year's BlizzCon,
6225000	6228000	and so that's why StarCraft getting cancelled, I believe,
6228000	6230000	is in part the internet's fault.
6230000	6232000	Now, granted, one could argue, well,
6232000	6234000	Blizzard should have never brought a half-assed thing to BlizzCon in the first place,
6234000	6238000	but did you have to drag them that bad?
6238000	6242000	Did you have to get up on stage and actually ask to the guy's face,
6242000	6244000	which was a little bit disrespectful,
6244000	6247000	is this an April Fool's joke that's out of season?
6247000	6249000	What do you think?
6250000	6251000	So.
6251000	6255000	Well, to be, well, to play devil's advocate,
6255000	6259000	I'm sure that they felt a little bit entitled,
6259000	6263000	because they paid money to be at that event,
6263000	6267000	is why they felt entitled to see something that they wanted to see
6267000	6270000	versus, like, this is what we have to show you,
6270000	6272000	too bad that you don't like it.
6272000	6275000	Some folks in chat making the joke,
6275000	6277000	I think I must admit I've seen before,
6277000	6280000	StarCraft Ghost cancelled for a second time, in a way.
6280000	6283000	Wouldn't that have been ironic if this game had been StarCraft Ghost,
6283000	6285000	because it didn't have a name?
6285000	6287000	How about that? Can you imagine if,
6287000	6289000	let's fan-wank for a minute,
6289000	6291000	because we already know this isn't going to happen,
6291000	6293000	but if they had done this BlizzCon, they do this unveil,
6293000	6296000	and the title comes up, it's StarCraft Ghost.
6296000	6297000	And people would have been like,
6297000	6298000	What?
6298000	6299000	That's exactly,
6299000	6300000	What?
6300000	6305000	They would have lost their mind that StarCraft Ghost was resurrected.
6305000	6306000	Right?
6306000	6307000	I don't know.
6307000	6309000	I think people would have went crazy.
6309000	6311000	And Slidekick is in our chat and wants to know,
6311000	6314000	OMG Rob, are you drinking from a Gwen Stefani cup?
6314000	6315000	Yes, I am.
6315000	6318000	I got this when we saw the Vegas residency show.
6319000	6321000	I'm surprised you can see that on Twitch,
6321000	6322000	probably because we're zoomed in tonight.
6322000	6324000	We're zoomed in a little bit on the Twitch picture,
6324000	6326000	because Jamie's not here, so we don't have to be over the shoulder,
6326000	6329000	so we have a little tighter shot on Loki and I,
6329000	6331000	so I guess you can even see what's written on the cup,
6331000	6332000	so there you go.
6332000	6333000	Yes, you can.
6333000	6334000	You can look right there.
6334000	6335000	Oh yes, I can also just look at the TV,
6335000	6336000	but I'm trying not to do that,
6336000	6338000	because when I look over here, it looks weird,
6338000	6339000	so I'm trying to look at you.
6339000	6340000	All right, anyway.
6341000	6343000	Mistake Theory in chat says,
6343000	6344000	Well, maybe I'm just uninitiated,
6344000	6346000	but I don't know what StarCraft Ghost is.
6346000	6349000	Hey, good call, because that was a long time ago, right?
6349000	6352000	So StarCraft Ghost was a StarCraft spin-off game
6352000	6354000	that they were making, and it was like a shooty game.
6354000	6356000	It was behind, you know, because StarCraft isn't like that.
6356000	6359000	StarCraft is like Warcraft in space, right?
6359000	6360000	It's a tactical game,
6360000	6362000	but they were going to do another game in that universe
6362000	6364000	that was like over the shoulder, right?
6364000	6365000	It was Nova, right?
6365000	6366000	It was starring her, I think,
6366000	6367000	and it was like a shooty game,
6367000	6371000	and it was being developed for Nintendo 64, PlayStation 1?
6371000	6372000	It was old.
6372000	6373000	PlayStation 2, I guess.
6373000	6374000	It was old.
6374000	6375000	It was being made for, you know,
6375000	6378000	maybe it was PlayStation 2 in that era of games,
6378000	6380000	because it would have been like the mid-late 90s,
6380000	6383000	because Bobby saw it a long time ago in Atlanta.
6383000	6385000	So it would have been like, what, 98 or something like that.
6385000	6387000	So it was around that time.
6387000	6389000	So, yeah, it was a while ago.
6389000	6390000	Yeah, Quest Buster confirms there.
6390000	6392000	Yeah, in the late 90s.
6392000	6394000	Yeah, so, all right.
6394000	6395000	So there you go.
6395000	6397000	Unfortunate to hear about that cancellation at Blizzard,
6397000	6398000	but who knows?
6398000	6400000	Maybe the game will come back,
6400000	6402000	and Diablo 4, I guess,
6402000	6404000	is almost certain to be a BlizzCon announcement this year.
6404000	6406000	Maybe Overwatch 2 as well,
6406000	6409000	but don't get your hopes up.
6410000	6413000	Don't do it, because it's a dangerous thing to do.
6413000	6415000	Loki, what do you have for us?
6415000	6420000	So there's this Apple event that was going on.
6420000	6424000	So they had talked a little bit about TVOS,
6424000	6429000	and, of course, the new things that are going to be coming to that,
6429000	6432000	which I think was one of those is the,
6432000	6434000	was it they called the Apple Arcade or whatever that was?
6434000	6435000	Yeah.
6435000	6436000	So part of that, though,
6436000	6439000	they were saying that there was going to be support with TVOS
6439000	6441000	for third-party controllers.
6441000	6445000	So Xbox One and PlayStation 4 controllers have support,
6445000	6448000	so you can actually use those to play games on TVOS
6448000	6451000	and the games that are on there.
6451000	6452000	So, neat.
6452000	6454000	I mean, that makes sense.
6454000	6456000	Yeah, and assuming, you know,
6456000	6457000	they're just assuming, I guess,
6457000	6459000	that a lot of homes have those controllers already.
6459000	6460000	Probably.
6460000	6461000	So maybe, unlike Google Stadia,
6461000	6462000	they're like,
6462000	6463000	well, we don't really need to sell a separate one.
6463000	6464000	Well, and to be fair,
6464000	6465000	in Google Stadia's case,
6465000	6467000	it also supports those controllers, too.
6467000	6469000	It's just that they have an extra one that they're going to sell, too,
6469000	6472000	that ties into the network and all that stuff, whatever.
6472000	6475000	But Apple maybe doesn't see a need to reinvent the wheel.
6475000	6477000	They figure, oh, people have these devices in their home already.
6477000	6479000	Let's just make, you know, it's all Bluetooth anyway.
6479000	6482000	Let's just make our device work with it, which seems pretty smart,
6482000	6485000	especially if Apple Arcade is going to have, you know,
6485000	6487000	more games that require a controller.
6487000	6490000	So what I'm really curious to see is when we start seeing these games
6490000	6492000	that are on Apple Arcade,
6492000	6495000	maybe they're not going to be necessarily just touchscreen games.
6495000	6497000	Yeah, I would hope so.
6497000	6504000	Otherwise, it doesn't really seem like a very promising platform.
6504000	6505000	Yeah.
6505000	6508000	So very curious to see more on that
6508000	6512000	and how that develops and what type of games are on Apple Arcade in the future.
6512000	6515000	Moving on, I'm surprised I didn't give this story to you.
6515000	6517000	I guess I ran out of spots.
6517000	6518000	I know you're the Borderlands fan,
6518000	6521000	but feel free to comment on this further if you'd like.
6521000	6524000	But it was announced that Borderlands 2 is officially,
6524000	6526000	because I think it was leaked early on, but they confirmed it.
6526000	6529000	Yeah, it leaked out onto the Steam store.
6529000	6532000	That Borderlands 2 would get new DLC,
6532000	6535000	and it's in anticipation of Borderlands 3's release.
6535000	6539000	The Borderlands 2 DLC is Commander Lilith and the fight for Sanctuary.
6539000	6541000	And yeah, leaked out to Steam,
6541000	6544000	but then it was confirmed during the Microsoft event today
6544000	6549000	that, yeah, this DLC is upping the game's level cap to 80,
6549000	6552000	and you can just start a new character at level 30 if you want
6552000	6553000	to just jump right into it.
6553000	6555000	So that's pretty cool.
6555000	6556000	So yeah.
6556000	6557000	Out the plate.
6557000	6558000	Yeah.
6558000	6561000	Now, they're saying that this...
6561000	6562000	Did it just come out today?
6562000	6563000	I think so, yeah.
6563000	6564000	No, that's good, because I was going to say,
6564000	6566000	if it doesn't release soon,
6566000	6569000	then there's not going to be a lot of time to enjoy it before Borderlands 3 comes out.
6569000	6573000	Yeah, because today was also when they put it on Games Pass as well.
6573000	6574000	So it's available.
6574000	6578000	Games Pass also has the DLC and everything's available,
6578000	6580000	and then this is available as well for free.
6580000	6581000	So you get that.
6581000	6582000	Yeah.
6582000	6583000	Pretty cool.
6583000	6587000	So I'm still on Borderlands 1,
6587000	6589000	making my way slowly to Borderlands 2,
6589000	6591000	so I probably won't get to this anytime soon,
6591000	6593000	but is this something you might check out?
6593000	6594000	Yeah, I might.
6594000	6597000	I probably should start Borderlands 2.
6597000	6598000	That's going to be the case.
6598000	6600000	Metal Mayhem points out the DLC's free too.
6600000	6601000	Yeah.
6601000	6603000	Which, if it's a big advertisement for the third game,
6603000	6607000	in a way, then it makes sense that you might put that out there for free
6607000	6611000	to try to make sure you get those $60 pre-orders from Borderlands 3, right?
6611000	6612000	Yeah.
6612000	6615000	And maybe some limited edition sales and so forth as well.
6615000	6617000	Loki, you got one more story for us, right?
6617000	6621000	Yeah, so this is a little bit of a preview of what we might see tomorrow with Ubisoft,
6621000	6626000	but apparently there is a leak that a game called Watchdog Legion
6626000	6629000	is going to be announced tomorrow,
6629000	6633000	and it's supposed to be the brand new Watchdogs game
6633000	6635000	where it's going to allow you to play as anyone,
6635000	6638000	every individual you meet in the open world,
6638000	6641000	has a full set of animations, voiceover, character traits,
6641000	6646000	and visuals that are generated and guided by gameplay systems.
6646000	6652000	So that's how they're describing it according to the Amazon UK listing for this.
6652000	6654000	So neat that that would be a thing.
6654000	6656000	I don't know how exactly that plays into it.
6656000	6659000	The new game is supposed to take place in London,
6659000	6661000	so I guess we'll find out tomorrow,
6661000	6664000	which I'm sure this will be a big part of the announcement,
6664000	6669000	or they're going to have, I would imagine, a big portion of the Ubisoft event dedicated to this.
6669000	6675000	Of course, not before they have a really awkward fucking dance number for Just Dance,
6675000	6679000	because they do that every fucking year, and it's goddamn annoying.
6679000	6682000	And I'm sure this year will be no different.
6682000	6685000	Yeah, I'm going to just, well, I have to work tomorrow anyway,
6685000	6688000	and I'm not going to try to watch these things while I'm at work.
6688000	6691000	I'll look at the bullet points, though, which you missed a little later on.
6691000	6693000	There's some good YouTube trailers to see. I'll look at those.
6693000	6696000	But the Square Enix one is probably the only one I'm going to watch live,
6696000	6700000	because I wonder if they'll announce a release date for Final Fantasy VII Remake.
6700000	6701000	I wonder.
6701000	6702000	Maybe.
6702000	6704000	That would make a lot of sense.
6704000	6706000	They got Sony's slot.
6706000	6709000	I wonder if they might be announcing anything from PlayStation 4 tomorrow
6709000	6711000	that might be a big deal for this year.
6711000	6714000	Or early next year, maybe.
6714000	6717000	All right, anyway, we're about to get to our Discord calls,
6717000	6721000	so if you want to join our Discord over at voggenetwork.com slash Discord,
6721000	6723000	that'll get you an invite to the server.
6723000	6725000	We'll be taking those calls in just a little bit
6725000	6727000	if you want to join our Green Room channel
6727000	6729000	and tell us what you want to call in about tonight
6729000	6731000	in our channel, Orange Lounge Radio.
6731000	6736000	But first, I'm sure you guys have seen this story floating around the Internet.
6736000	6740000	There is going to be Xbox Body Wash coming out. That's right.
6740000	6743000	Are they going to hand that out at E3?
6743000	6744000	Let's hope.
6744000	6748000	Some personal hygiene products called Xbox Links,
6748000	6750000	which is funny because Atari had a system called the Links,
6750000	6752000	and it's spelled L-Y-N-X. Yeah, right.
6752000	6755000	So, the Xbox Links.
6755000	6759000	Links is what they call Axe in Australia.
6759000	6761000	So, like Axe Body Spray.
6761000	6763000	That's what they call it in Australia.
6763000	6767000	So, assumably, if this product is coming stateside as well,
6767000	6770000	it's going to be Microsoft Axe as well.
6770000	6773000	However, a representative did say,
6773000	6776000	there are no plans to offer this in the U.S. at this time.
6776000	6778000	However, we would certainly love to.
6778000	6782000	So, this may only be a thing that's going to be Australia, New Zealand, China,
6782000	6784000	or something like that.
6784000	6787000	It is a nice, bright green color,
6787000	6790000	because if you've ever seen Axe Body Wash sitting on the shelf,
6790000	6793000	it's always these giant fluorescent colors.
6793000	6796000	There's crazy blue and screaming yellow,
6796000	6799000	and just screaming Mr. Smoosh in the background over there.
6799000	6802000	Screaming yellow and red and all these very bright colors.
6802000	6806000	So, this bright green that they're looking at doing the Xbox Links in
6806000	6807000	is no different.
6807000	6812000	But how do you feel about game makers getting into body washes?
6812000	6817000	It makes sense, and if it gets some people aware to bathe themselves,
6817000	6819000	then I'm all for it.
6819000	6822000	I just couldn't help but laugh my ass off
6822000	6825000	when this was the first thing I saw after I read that article
6825000	6828000	about how some dude wants to do a straight pride parade in Boston.
6831000	6835000	I was like, oh, Xbox Axe, here's some official gear.
6835000	6838000	Although, I don't know if you saw what Axe Body Spray said
6838000	6840000	to somebody on Twitter,
6840000	6843000	but I've got to say, props to Axe.
6843000	6848000	Axe posted a happy pride like a lot of corporations do this month,
6848000	6850000	and of course they got that response that was like,
6850000	6853000	gay people shouldn't be celebrated, blah, blah, blah.
6853000	6856000	And Axe responded something to the effect of,
6856000	6857000	I don't have it right in front of me,
6857000	6858000	Axe responded something to the effect of,
6858000	6861000	gay rights are human rights, but go off, Jill.
6866000	6868000	And as much as I'm not a big fan
6868000	6872000	of the humanizing of brand accounts on Twitter
6872000	6875000	because they're everywhere, that one was fucking funny.
6875000	6881000	I always appreciate a good dragging
6881000	6884000	of somebody who is completely wrong on that issue.
6884000	6888000	Anyway, SheHulk10 in chat says,
6888000	6891000	I would like to smell like a new Xbox.
6891000	6899000	Does it smell like burning components?
6899000	6902000	Does the red ring of death smell?
6902000	6904000	They don't say what it smells like.
6904000	6907000	It smells like green, I guess, I don't know.
6907000	6908000	Green.
6908000	6909000	Yeah, it's that.
6909000	6912000	Anyway, I will check in to see if there's any last minute stories,
6912000	6914000	but some folks in chat are commenting on Mr. Smoosh.
6914000	6917000	S2 and Hunter Matt saying, Mr. Smoosh has E3 breaking news.
6917000	6918000	Feed me and give me attention.
6918000	6919000	Can you guys hear?
6919000	6920000	That is really loud.
6920000	6921000	He's very, very big.
6921000	6924000	He knows it's about dinner time,
6924000	6927000	and his other dad should be home right now to feed him,
6927000	6930000	but my understanding is that his other dad
6930000	6933000	is in line at Target right now, so he's not home yet.
6933000	6937000	So, I think Mr. Smoosh is just very anxious for some wet food,
6937000	6941000	even though the fat boy got dry food just a couple hours ago, didn't he?
6941000	6943000	You want to come make a cameo?
6943000	6944000	Mr. Smoosh?
6944000	6945000	Smoosh?
6945000	6947000	You want to come make a cameo?
6947000	6948000	I'm going to try.
6948000	6949000	He's like, no.
6949000	6950000	No, he's just going to stay out of there and look.
6950000	6951000	Sorry, guys.
6951000	6952000	All right.
6952000	6953000	Anyway.
6953000	6954000	He'll come to me.
6954000	6955000	Oh, is he coming over?
6955000	6956000	That doesn't mean he'll get picked up on cam, though.
6956000	6959000	He's got to get up on the couch in order to get up on cam.
6959000	6961000	Well, maybe he can come up here.
6961000	6962000	Look, I got food.
6962000	6963000	Food over here.
6963000	6964000	How's that?
6964000	6965000	He smells of food.
6965000	6967000	All right, we're going to get to a call while Loki continues
6967000	6969000	to try to placate Mr. Smoosh here.
6969000	6973000	Let's get to it, and then I'll ask for a last minute story.
6973000	6974000	But first, we have a call.
6974000	6975000	Hi, you're on Orange Moms Radio.
6975000	6976000	Who's this?
6976000	6977000	Hey, what's going on, everyone?
6977000	6978000	I hit you on the...
6978000	6979000	Hey, Rama.
6979000	6980000	Good to hear from you.
6980000	6981000	Wow, you're coming through loud.
6981000	6983000	Sorry if it's echoing back to those of you that are listening live.
6983000	6985000	I'll try to adjust the volume on the fly.
6985000	6987000	What's on your mind tonight, buddy?
6987000	6990000	Not too much, and I'm also adjusting the volume on the fly on my end, too,
6990000	6992000	just to be on the safe side.
6992000	6993000	No worries.
6993000	6994000	What's on your mind tonight?
6994000	6995000	All right.
6995000	7001000	I saw the Microsoft compressor, and I was done at PSO2.
7001000	7004000	I was absolutely done.
7004000	7007000	Did you see the opening to tonight's show?
7007000	7011000	I probably missed it because I was on my way back from another outing
7011000	7015000	because I had been out all week, and as soon as I came home...
7015000	7016000	It's all right.
7016000	7017000	It's all right.
7017000	7018000	Go back and watch it.
7018000	7020000	Hopefully, somebody clipped it, but if they didn't, then go back
7020000	7022000	and watch it at some point.
7022000	7023000	I will.
7023000	7025000	I will.
7025000	7028000	So you're excited about PSO2 as well?
7028000	7029000	Yes.
7029000	7031000	I mean, they put it frankly.
7031000	7032000	I'm like...
7032000	7033000	I'm watching here.
7033000	7034000	I'm like, no.
7034000	7035000	No way.
7035000	7036000	No way.
7036000	7037000	Then I go, wait.
7037000	7038000	That's not a carrier.
7038000	7039000	No, no, no, no.
7039000	7040000	That's got to be PSO2.
7040000	7041000	Right in there.
7041000	7045000	I looked at the screen, and I looked at my laundry.
7045000	7046000	The fresh laundry.
7046000	7047000	Screen.
7047000	7048000	Yeah.
7048000	7050000	I changed my underwear after seeing that.
7050000	7052000	I was done.
7052000	7056000	So you are also hype about PSO2.
7056000	7060000	I expressed a reservation that this game's been out for years and years
7060000	7061000	and years.
7061000	7062000	How are they going to keep it fresh and interesting?
7062000	7064000	Do you have any reservations of that sort?
7064000	7067000	Or are you just like, no, just put it in my veins?
7067000	7068000	Not really.
7068000	7070000	I mean, the fact that it's going to be free to play
7070000	7072000	and they're giving us all of the expansions,
7072000	7076000	I think they're going to do right by us.
7076000	7077000	Yeah.
7077000	7082000	I'm just trying not to get my expectations up too high
7082000	7086000	so that I'm pleasantly surprised when it exceeds my low expectations,
7086000	7091000	which I think is a good thing to do in general, right?
7091000	7095000	Basically, go in expecting the best but preparing for the worst.
7095000	7096000	Yeah.
7096000	7099000	So did anything else at the Microsoft Presser catch your eye,
7099000	7103000	or is it like everything else is a blur because of that?
7103000	7106000	Battletoads, I was like, oh, yeah?
7106000	7107000	For real?
7107000	7108000	Okay.
7108000	7109000	Game on.
7109000	7113000	What did you think about the Game Pass that they're offering?
7113000	7118000	The $14.99 a month gold plus Game Pass on Xbox plus Game Pass on PC?
7118000	7123000	Because I have to admit, the fact that now Game Pass is on PC
7123000	7127000	and it's bundled with like Xbox Live for the console and then the Xbox,
7127000	7129000	I'm kind of interested, I think.
7129000	7130000	What were your thoughts?
7130000	7133000	I kind of feel Microsoft is spreading themselves thin with that,
7133000	7137000	but on the same token, they're trying to incorporate everybody.
7137000	7140000	But I don't game enough to say that this is a worth value,
7140000	7143000	so if anybody else is going to get it,
7143000	7146000	they'll probably enjoy it a lot better than I would.
7146000	7148000	Fair enough. Fair enough.
7148000	7151000	Well, anything else you want to say about Microsoft's event tonight?
7151000	7153000	Cyberpunk 2077, bro.
7153000	7155000	Yeah, that game looks pretty hot.
7155000	7158000	What about Keanu?
7158000	7160000	Now, y'all know me.
7160000	7163000	I am the cheap gamer.
7163000	7166000	You have to have a really good reason for me to go out
7166000	7170000	and buy a game day one and pay it a $60 price.
7170000	7174000	I was already looking into picking up 2077.
7174000	7177000	I really enjoyed the trailer from last year
7177000	7179000	and the 45-minute game playthrough.
7179000	7182000	I'm like, okay, I'm going to enjoy this.
7182000	7185000	This was just the icing on the cake for me.
7185000	7186000	Yeah, for sure.
7186000	7191000	I think Keanu is a nice cherry on top of this dessert
7191000	7194000	many people were waiting for already, so it was very, very awesome.
7194000	7201000	The real question is, though, since this is a game where you can romance people,
7201000	7203000	are you going to be able to romance Keanu Reeves?
7203000	7205000	Oh, yeah. One of my friends wrote a tweet that said,
7205000	7209000	when do I get to fuck Keanu Reeves?
7209000	7212000	And I just retweeted it. I thought it was funny.
7212000	7215000	I might have to find that tweet and retweet it my own self.
7215000	7219000	Yes. All right. Well, Rama, anything else on your mind tonight?
7219000	7222000	In response to the article about Xbox body wash,
7222000	7226000	the irony is when that article first popped up,
7226000	7231000	I have been seeing this grassroots campaign
7231000	7238000	to telling people when you go to conventions, shower, wash yourself, shower, do that.
7238000	7241000	And it's like, this is popping up.
7241000	7244000	I'm like, you know, even Microsoft is telling you,
7244000	7247000	you need to leave the game room for five minutes,
7247000	7253000	go up to your room, shower, come back downstairs, and then game some more.
7253000	7256000	Rama, I wouldn't expect you to know of this YouTube celebrity,
7256000	7259000	but I'm going to share this YouTube celebrity for you.
7259000	7261000	This particular celebrity is very famous right now
7261000	7264000	because there's a little short clip circulating around the internet
7264000	7268000	where she goes, and her name is Jasmine Masters,
7268000	7270000	and she's an amazing queen from RuPaul's Drag Race.
7270000	7273000	And she has this whole series, and you just need to find it on YouTube
7273000	7276000	where she talks about, you need to wash your ass,
7276000	7278000	and you need to scrub your balls.
7278000	7280000	And she goes this whole thing on it,
7280000	7282000	and I think it's something that should be required viewing
7282000	7284000	before going to a convention.
7284000	7288000	She's not gone. I'm telling you, she's not gone.
7289000	7292000	I walked into the game room,
7292000	7296000	and I felt like my mother slapped the living shit out of me
7296000	7299000	because of how strong that funk was.
7299000	7302000	I'm like, I should have brought my console from home
7302000	7304000	and stayed in my damn room.
7304000	7308000	God, I can tell you stories of the fanboy funk.
7308000	7314000	If I ever, if I ever get to the day where VOG Network has a convention,
7314000	7317000	I'm going to have that Jasmine Masters videos on loop
7317000	7318000	in the registration line.
7318000	7320000	Please do. I mean, there are already,
7320000	7323000	there was this convention in the mid-Atlantic, Midwest,
7323000	7328000	Colossal Kong, they were giving out small things of deodorant.
7328000	7331000	You didn't have, there wasn't, it was like, here, take it.
7331000	7332000	You know?
7332000	7335000	Nifty 805 in chat says,
7335000	7339000	I remember that gamer X attendees smell lovely.
7339000	7341000	We'll just do this.
7341000	7346000	Instead of bomb sniffing dogs, we'll get like B.O. sniffing dogs,
7346000	7349000	and so they can sniff out the people that are really rank,
7349000	7353000	and we can like, yeah.
7353000	7355000	Dog is very disturbed by your smells, sir.
7355000	7357000	You can have eggs at the line.
7357000	7358000	Wow.
7358000	7362000	Speaking of all this, did you see SacAnime this weekend downtown?
7362000	7363000	I heard that it was going on.
7363000	7364000	I heard it was going on.
7364000	7367000	They had SacAnime the same freaking, okay,
7367000	7369000	so usually I can't go to SacAnime
7369000	7371000	because it's the same weekend as Dragon Con, right?
7371000	7373000	So they move it to a different date this year,
7373000	7375000	and they put it the same weekend as Pride.
7376000	7379000	Well, there's multiple Prides going on in New York.
7379000	7381000	Like, last Sunday was Queen's Pride.
7381000	7386000	I'm going to New York Pride at the end of the month as the token straight,
7386000	7388000	so, you know.
7388000	7390000	Allies are important.
7390000	7392000	It's good to have them close, yeah.
7392000	7393000	True.
7393000	7394000	All right.
7394000	7396000	Well, Rama, I'm going to let you go,
7396000	7399000	but before I do let you go, I just want to remind you, Rama,
7399000	7401000	you're breathtaking.
7401000	7403000	Aw, I get it from y'all.
7403000	7405000	I learn it from y'all, so, you know.
7405000	7406000	Excellent.
7406000	7407000	Excellent response.
7407000	7408000	I approve.
7408000	7409000	All right.
7409000	7410000	Take care, buddy.
7410000	7411000	It's always good to hear from you.
7411000	7412000	Later, fam.
7412000	7413000	Bye.
7413000	7414000	All right.
7414000	7415000	Do we have any?
7415000	7417000	I don't see anybody else in the green room right now,
7417000	7419000	but do we have any other stories to talk about?
7419000	7420000	Yes.
7420000	7422000	Let's talk about some of the stuff from Devolver Digital.
7422000	7424000	Yes, since they've been going on,
7424000	7426000	and we kind of were doing a show about that.
7426000	7428000	So this is an announcement I was not expecting.
7428000	7430000	So, you know, enter the Gungeon.
7430000	7434000	Well, they announced a brand-new game in the enter the Gungeon series
7434000	7439000	called Enter the Gungeon House of the Gun Dead.
7439000	7440000	Nice.
7440000	7443000	It's an arcade shooter game.
7443000	7444000	Oh, that's kind of cool.
7444000	7445000	It's an arcade gun game.
7445000	7446000	So it's separate.
7446000	7447000	It's not DLC or something.
7447000	7449000	It's going to be in arcades.
7449000	7451000	Oh, shit.
7451000	7452000	That's pretty cool.
7452000	7453000	Yes.
7453000	7454000	Oh, nice.
7454000	7456000	So I am totally down for that.
7456000	7457000	That's really cool.
7457000	7458000	And then, of course,
7458000	7461000	they announced a Devolver bootleg collection.
7461000	7465000	It's all these bootleg games of their games.
7465000	7466000	It's hilarious.
7466000	7468000	They did like Enter the Gun Dungeon,
7468000	7472000	or Hotline Milwaukee, Ape Out Junior.
7472000	7474000	So they took a bunch of people that hacked their games?
7474000	7477000	No, I think they made their own bootleg games of their own games.
7477000	7478000	Oh, okay.
7478000	7479000	That's so weird.
7479000	7480000	Shooty Boots,
7481000	7484000	Super Absolver Mini Turbo Fighting Championship,
7484000	7485000	Catsylvania.
7485000	7486000	It's a cat game.
7486000	7487000	Catsylvania?
7487000	7489000	It's a cat inside of a suit of armor.
7489000	7491000	It's a cat in full-played armor.
7491000	7493000	What else do you want?
7493000	7495000	Just that game, TBH.
7495000	7496000	I want that.
7496000	7498000	Luft Trousers,
7498000	7499000	Pee-book,
7499000	7500000	Pekoo,
7500000	7502000	Pekoo Ball Stars.
7502000	7504000	I have no idea what that is.
7504000	7505000	But it sounds hilarious.
7505000	7508000	And it's on Steam right now for $4.94
7508000	7509000	for eight games.
7509000	7511000	I heard it's 1% off right now.
7511000	7512000	1% off, yes.
7512000	7513000	1% off.
7513000	7514000	That's a pretty good price.
7514000	7516000	Oh, there we go.
7516000	7518000	More late-breaking news just coming in.
7518000	7520000	So, you know how we're supposed to hear the date
7520000	7522000	of the Final Fantasy VII Remake at that concert?
7522000	7523000	Yeah.
7523000	7524000	It just came out.
7524000	7526000	March 3rd, 2020 was announced as the date.
7526000	7527000	March 3rd, 2020.
7527000	7529000	So, it was this winter,
7529000	7531000	but it's like the last days of winter.
7531000	7533000	So, but there it is.
7533000	7535000	March 3rd, 2020 Final Fantasy VII Remake.
7535000	7536000	It's happening.
7537000	7538000	Cool.
7538000	7540000	I'm not gonna lie.
7540000	7541000	I'm gonna be there day one.
7541000	7542000	I'm excited for it.
7542000	7544000	I know a lot of y'all love to hate on VII,
7544000	7545000	and that's fine,
7545000	7548000	but I'm really excited to kind of check it out
7548000	7549000	with these souped-up graphics
7549000	7551000	and sort of like for a new generation there.
7551000	7552000	So, it's really, really cool.
7552000	7554000	I was gonna say other things that I saw this week
7554000	7555000	that were pretty cool.
7555000	7558000	They announced the remake for Destroy All Humans,
7558000	7559000	which is awesome.
7559000	7561000	And Romshine in the trailer, of course.
7561000	7563000	It's gonna be fantastic.
7565000	7569000	They have a remake of the SpongeBob,
7569000	7573000	Battle for Bikini Bottom or something that they're doing.
7573000	7574000	That's kind of random.
7574000	7575000	I'm surprised.
7575000	7577000	I know Activision has like...
7577000	7579000	They need to do a SpongeBob meme game.
7579000	7581000	There's so many SpongeBob memes now.
7581000	7583000	There's the whole like the all caps
7583000	7586000	when you say something sarcastically back to somebody,
7586000	7587000	that whole thing.
7587000	7588000	And then now I'm seeing one
7588000	7590000	where they put SpongeBob in like all these weird,
7590000	7591000	I don't even know,
7591000	7594000	it's like these weird places and scenery and yeah.
7594000	7597000	And it's like me when I show up to the place alone,
7597000	7598000	or something like that.
7598000	7599000	SpongeBob memes are everywhere,
7599000	7601000	so you should make a game out of it.
7601000	7602000	Yeah.
7602000	7604000	Or Sonic the Hedgehog memes.
7604000	7605000	Yes.
7606000	7607000	Perfect.
7608000	7609000	So, yeah.
7609000	7611000	I guess that's it.
7611000	7613000	That's all I got for now.
7613000	7614000	I mean, I'm sure there's stuff
7614000	7615000	that we're forgetting out there.
7615000	7616000	Yeah.
7616000	7617000	They talked about Carrion.
7617000	7618000	That was another announcement
7618000	7619000	that they have for Devolver Digital,
7619000	7620000	but that one's kind of cool.
7620000	7622000	It's a reverse horror game.
7622000	7624000	You play like almost like The Thing,
7624000	7626000	and you're going around and infecting people
7626000	7629000	into this giant, amorphous, massive body parts,
7629000	7631000	and it's kind of horrific,
7631000	7634000	but fun because you're attacking people.
7634000	7635000	Yeah.
7635000	7636000	Okay.
7636000	7637000	Yeah.
7637000	7638000	Good times.
7638000	7639000	All right.
7639000	7640000	Well, I don't see any other calls waiting on the line,
7640000	7641000	so I guess we'll move to start
7641000	7642000	to wrap things up here a little bit,
7642000	7644000	even though for being E3 week,
7644000	7645000	it was a little bit of a shorter show.
7645000	7647000	But we're only part way through E3.
7647000	7649000	There's still so much more news to come,
7649000	7650000	so it's a bummer we have to wait
7650000	7651000	all the way till next Sunday
7651000	7652000	to talk about it again.
7652000	7655000	But of course, you can always follow the show on Twitter,
7655000	7657000	at OLR, or my personal Twitter,
7657000	7658000	at MrRobRoberts.
7658000	7659000	Loki's on Twitter,
7659000	7660000	at LokiOLR.
7660000	7662000	And then Dark Soccer is also on Twitter as well,
7662000	7663000	at Dark Soccer,
7663000	7664000	although she tends to be more
7664000	7667000	of a Facebook-y slash Tumblr person,
7667000	7669000	which we missed Dark Soccer tonight,
7669000	7671000	but she will be back to join us next week.
7671000	7673000	And of course, in seven days,
7673000	7676000	we'll know what Nintendo's got planned for the next year.
7676000	7677000	Animal Crossing.
7677000	7678000	Yeah, let's Animal Crossing.
7678000	7681000	You think we'll get any surprises out of Nintendo
7681000	7683000	and what they do?
7683000	7684000	The funny thing is,
7684000	7685000	for those that listen on the podcast,
7685000	7687000	some people are gonna hear this,
7687000	7689000	possibly after Nintendo's already done their thing,
7689000	7691000	and how stupid these predictions might be.
7691000	7692000	But anything-
7692000	7693000	Okay, let's make predictions then.
7693000	7694000	Why not?
7694000	7696000	All right, what do you think Nintendo's gonna do?
7696000	7698000	They're gonna have Animal Crossing.
7698000	7701000	They're gonna talk about Pokemon again a little bit.
7701000	7704000	They may talk about Mario Maker 2 a little bit.
7704000	7706000	I think as far as I'm concerned,
7706000	7710000	we're gonna see maybe something for Bayonetta 3,
7710000	7716000	and I would be willing to bet Minecraft Steve for Smash.
7716000	7718000	Okay, Minecraft Steve for Smash.
7718000	7719000	That's an interesting one.
7719000	7722000	Let's see, for me, Animal Crossing's a given.
7722000	7726000	Link's Awakening remake is on the lanyards at E3, apparently,
7726000	7727000	so that's definitely gonna be a focus.
7727000	7728000	Right, I would expect that would be...
7728000	7730000	They could be talking a little bit more of that.
7730000	7732000	I thought that would be more of a treehouse thing.
7732000	7733000	Yeah.
7733000	7735000	No, I think especially now that Metroid Prime 4
7735000	7737000	kind of fell off the calendar for them,
7737000	7739000	I think there are probably gonna be other games
7739000	7740000	that they're kind of boosting up
7740000	7743000	to kind of make sure that this holiday is okay for them.
7743000	7746000	Super Nintendo games, maybe for...
7746000	7747000	Here's hoping.
7747000	7748000	Nintendo Channel tipping.
7748000	7750000	Yeah, for the Famicom channel.
7750000	7752000	Or the Famicom channel.
7752000	7753000	You know what I mean.
7753000	7754000	Switch online.
7754000	7755000	NES.
7755000	7756000	They should do Nintendo 64.
7756000	7758000	They should just do all these things.
7758000	7760000	Super Nintendo games would be great.
7760000	7763000	I'd really be excited for that.
7763000	7765000	Secret of Mana remake.
7765000	7766000	We are... Not the remake.
7766000	7767000	The collection.
7767000	7768000	Second Densetsu collection.
7768000	7771000	I'm gonna put stock that that's probably real.
7771000	7773000	Could that be a Square Enix thing?
7773000	7775000	Ooh, yeah, we may hear about that tomorrow
7775000	7776000	at Square Enix thing.
7776000	7777000	That's true.
7777000	7778000	So I'm gonna hope that that's real
7778000	7779000	and coming out on the Switch,
7779000	7780000	and that's gonna be the first time
7780000	7781000	we get Second Densetsu 3,
7781000	7783000	and that's gonna be a big fucking deal.
7783000	7785000	You talk about Phantasy Star Online 2 being old
7785000	7786000	and us finally getting it,
7786000	7788000	and that's gonna be the first time
7788000	7790000	we get Second Densetsu 3 being old and us finally getting it.
7790000	7792000	Let's talk about Second Densetsu 3, okay?
7792000	7794000	That'll be a pretty big fucking deal.
7794000	7795000	So there's that.
7795000	7797000	And I'm trying to think.
7797000	7800000	I would say I think I'm gonna go with something,
7800000	7802000	and Flacco had said this on Twitter,
7802000	7803000	and I think we're due for it.
7803000	7805000	I think a new Splatoon game could happen.
7805000	7810000	Because we know the final Splatoon 2 is happening.
7810000	7813000	The final Splatfest for Splatoon 2 is happening.
7813000	7815000	Thank you, Alan.
7815000	7816000	Product placement.
7816000	7817000	My God, Alan brought me snackies.
7817000	7819000	Oh, the Caramel one? Yeah.
7819000	7821000	Yeah, the Caramel ones are hella good.
7821000	7823000	Anyway, but they didn't pay me to say that.
7825000	7827000	Oh, so I think it's Splatoon 3.
7827000	7829000	Why not? We're ready.
7829000	7832000	I was gonna say, as far as Square Enix goes,
7832000	7835000	Final Fantasy XI Mobile?
7835000	7838000	Eh? When the hell is that gonna be announced?
7838000	7840000	And let's just throw something way out there.
7840000	7842000	Chugua Racing mobile game.
7842000	7845000	I don't want them to talk about Final Fantasy XIV.
7845000	7848000	Because we already know everything from Final Fantasy XIV expansion.
7848000	7850000	Don't retread that ground tomorrow.
7850000	7854000	Unless they're gonna announce Final Fantasy XIV for the Xbox One.
7854000	7856000	I think we're due for another Hitman game.
7856000	7858000	Could be that.
7858000	7859000	Yeah, that'd be good too.
7859000	7862000	Alright, well that's gonna do it for another episode of Orange Country.
7862000	7865000	We will be back in seven days to recap the second half of E3
7865000	7867000	and all these things that we're thinking about now.
7867000	7871000	And then of course you guys hopefully to chat along with us here in chat.
7871000	7873000	And Dark Soccer will be back as well.
7873000	7874000	And we'll have a good old time.
7874000	7875000	Enjoy E3.
7875000	7877000	Anybody that we know that happens to be there,
7877000	7879000	we hope that you're having a good time at the show.
7879000	7883000	And have a drink for us at one of the fun after parties in the area.
7883000	7885000	And it'll be a good time.
7885000	7887000	So, final thoughts time.
7887000	7889000	You have a final thought for us, Loki.
7889000	7891000	It's funny, in chat they say,
7891000	7895000	I predict Loki will delete the code to time the car live on stream
7895000	7898000	to stop people from mentioning it before Half-Life 3 comes out.
7898000	7901000	Funny enough, I would actually play that game on stream
7901000	7904000	I thought that the modern Unity can open it up
7904000	7907000	and actually I can render it as an executable.
7907000	7909000	But I don't know if I can.
7909000	7910000	I'll try it.
7910000	7913000	But I think you'll break it if I try to import it into...
7913000	7915000	Because I did that in Unity 5.
7915000	7917000	And we're like on 2019 now.
7917000	7921000	So I'd have to dig up a really old copy of Unity in order to open that up.
7921000	7922000	Fair enough.
7922000	7923000	Or actually it might have been Unity 4.
7923000	7925000	I don't know. It's really old.
7925000	7928000	As I always say, towards the end of every episode of Orange Country Radio,
7928000	7929000	help us spread the word.
7929000	7930000	Tell a friend or two about the show.
7930000	7932000	Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice
7932000	7935000	but only if the voices are here to be able to air out there.
7935000	7938000	I know we've been getting some new people coming in and watching
7938000	7939000	so we really appreciate that.
7939000	7942000	Hope you'll stick with us here at VoG Network.
7942000	7943000	Really appreciate that.
7943000	7946000	Auto hosts go a long way.
7946000	7949000	So if you're not already auto hosting our channel on Twitch at VoG Network,
7949000	7950000	please consider doing so.
7950000	7951000	It really helps us out a lot.
7951000	7955000	And Bobby, we're not just held up because of my entry into VoG Jam 1.
7955000	7958000	We're also held up because of Rob's entry into VoG Jam 1.
7958000	7959000	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
7959000	7961000	At least I finally played him at some point.
7961000	7962000	So there is that.
7962000	7964000	You can't give me shit about that anymore.
7964000	7967000	We've come a long way, I suppose.
7967000	7970000	Alright, well that's going to do it for another episode of Orange Country Radio.
7970000	7973000	Oh, my official final thought is M&M's.
7973000	7974000	Yay, candy.
7974000	7975000	Just what I need.
7975000	7976000	The caramel ones are pretty good.
7976000	7977000	Sugar rush right before I go to bed.
7977000	7978000	You know what's not good though?
7978000	7979000	What?
7979000	7981000	The raw cookie dough place I went to the other day
7981000	7983000	where they serve cookie dough like ice cream.
7983000	7985000	You'd think that would be good.
7985000	7987000	It is too much.
7987000	7988000	Oh, I went to a place like that in Vegas.
7988000	7989000	It wasn't bad.
7989000	7990000	I liked it.
7990000	7994000	It was sickening how rich and sugary that is.
7994000	7995000	Alright.
7995000	7998000	Well, on that note, we hope to be back in seven days
7998000	8001000	with another rich and sugary episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
8001000	8004000	And if anyone hasn't told you yet already, you're breathtaking.
