00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
With your hosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

00:14.000 --> 00:17.000
It's the annual Obvious Headline, E3 is upon us!

00:17.000 --> 00:21.000
Hopefully next year I won't have to intro how teased we still are about the forthcoming 9th console generation.

00:21.000 --> 00:28.000
This is the week's most obvious headline, stay tuned for the rest of the week's gaming news starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:28.000 --> 00:33.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:33.000 --> 00:40.000
Loki, it's happening! It's happening! Loki, I can't believe it, it's fucking happening!

00:40.000 --> 00:46.000
Phantasy Star Online 2 in the west, finally! Finally, Loki, finally!

00:46.000 --> 00:52.000
Do you know how many years? How many years have you been waiting for Phantasy Star Online 2?

00:52.000 --> 00:53.000
Several, yes.

00:53.000 --> 00:58.000
Hi! Welcome everybody! It's another week of Orange Lounge Radio, happy E3!

00:58.000 --> 01:05.000
It's a show where every gamer has a voice and we talk, of course, for 3 hours every week about video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

01:05.000 --> 01:14.000
My name is the very excited Rob Roberts to cover what would be, what, like our 16th year of E3 shenanigans and probably a game I've been waiting for 16 years to talk about.

01:14.000 --> 01:19.000
I am, of course, Rob Roberts and with me, as always, is Techmaster Loki.

01:19.000 --> 01:20.000
Hello.

01:20.000 --> 01:29.000
And not joining us tonight, Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers. She has the night off, she has a conflict tonight with her sister's organization.

01:29.000 --> 01:33.000
She's doing the Pride event in Sacramento with the sister group today.

01:33.000 --> 01:36.000
But, of course, she sends her love and all that.

01:36.000 --> 01:41.000
And, you know, for her, Animal Crossing is going to be covered on next week's show anyway.

01:41.000 --> 01:47.000
So tonight is going to be about some of the things we've seen thus far from Microsoft and all that good stuff.

01:47.000 --> 01:57.000
So, anyway. Alright. Let's get into it. I mean, it's E3. E3's back and we've covered a lot of stuff already.

01:57.000 --> 02:00.000
You're actually kind of keeping an eye on Bethesda's stuff as we're going, right?

02:00.000 --> 02:01.000
Yeah.

02:01.000 --> 02:03.000
There's a lot of fluff, I guess, going on.

02:03.000 --> 02:12.000
It's been, like, you know, they just for the last 10 minutes or so have been showing off mobile games, which no one gives a shit about.

02:12.000 --> 02:16.000
And then now they're showing off some stuff for Rage 2, which, yeah, that's cool.

02:16.000 --> 02:21.000
Yeah, that's cool. Alright. Well, we'll cover all the bullet points on Bethesda a little bit later, but let's get into.

02:21.000 --> 02:24.000
Did you have a chance to watch Microsoft's event?

02:24.000 --> 02:29.000
And, you know, I kind of would imagine it's kind of the tentpole event for a lot of people today.

02:29.000 --> 02:30.000
Did you have a chance to look at it?

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
I did watch it, yes. I watched the whole thing.

02:32.000 --> 02:33.000
Yeah?

02:33.000 --> 02:36.000
And it was pretty good. They had lots of game announcements.

02:36.000 --> 02:39.000
Lots of other, like, they talked about their new console.

02:39.000 --> 02:48.000
They talked about that Games Pass, you know, on PC now and, you know, the new Game Pass Ultimate stuff, which is pretty awesome.

02:48.000 --> 02:50.000
So lots of games.

02:50.000 --> 02:54.000
Yeah, definitely the message overall for Microsoft was games, games, games, games.

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
And I think that's a very good thing.

02:56.000 --> 03:06.000
You know, most people that I talk to that tend to be, like, anti-Microsoft or whatever, or I wouldn't say, like, anti-Microsoft, but maybe, like, just doesn't support Xbox or doesn't own an Xbox One.

03:06.000 --> 03:12.000
A lot of people are like, eh, they just don't really have the games. Or, you know, the games I want are on PlayStation or Nintendo Switch is more for me.

03:12.000 --> 03:13.000
Yeah.

03:13.000 --> 03:19.000
You know, I'm not sure. Well, I'm not sure. I find it also kind of matters what type of games you're into.

03:19.000 --> 03:25.000
And I'm not sure that maybe we saw a lot at Microsoft's events today that was going to change anybody's mind on that.

03:25.000 --> 03:27.000
That is a little bit of everything.

03:27.000 --> 03:32.000
There was some peppering of stuff, like the Tales of games as far as RPGs go and things like that.

03:32.000 --> 03:33.000
Yeah.

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
You know, I think there were a few things.

03:35.000 --> 03:41.000
But I don't know if anybody's mind, especially just judging off, like, Twitter reactions and so forth, I don't know if anybody's mind was changed on Microsoft.

03:41.000 --> 03:45.000
But I don't think that means to say that Microsoft did a bad job. I don't think they did by any means.

03:45.000 --> 03:53.000
And I don't really know what needs a change with Microsoft since most of their games, like, I think everybody has a PC, so most of those games are going to be playable on PC anyways.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.000
Right. Right.

03:54.000 --> 03:55.000
So, yeah.

03:55.000 --> 03:57.000
I'm going to go down the list.

03:57.000 --> 03:58.000
I made a big old list of stuff.

03:59.000 --> 04:04.000
So, obviously, I don't want to talk at length about necessarily everything, but certainly, I mean, there's a lot to talk about.

04:04.000 --> 04:08.000
So, it all started off with a game called Outer Worlds that looked very Fallout-y to me.

04:08.000 --> 04:09.000
I know we've kind of heard of this game before.

04:09.000 --> 04:11.000
Yeah, that was last year, too, they talked about it.

04:11.000 --> 04:12.000
But we'll see it in motion a little more.

04:12.000 --> 04:13.000
Yeah.

04:13.000 --> 04:16.000
Right? And so, it looks a little Fallout-y to me, which I think some of the developers...

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
It's the original developers of Fallout, like, New Vegas.

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
But, like, in space, which is cool.

04:20.000 --> 04:21.000
Yeah.

04:21.000 --> 04:22.000
Yeah. So, I was kind of into it.

04:22.000 --> 04:23.000
Yeah, it looks good.

04:23.000 --> 04:24.000
Yeah, I want to get it.

04:24.000 --> 04:25.000
Look kind of neat.

04:26.000 --> 04:31.000
It's a 4v4 that looks kind of like Overwatch, like, especially like the...

04:31.000 --> 04:32.000
A melee Overwatch, I guess?

04:32.000 --> 04:33.000
Yeah, like a melee Overwatch.

04:33.000 --> 04:34.000
Like, the character designs.

04:34.000 --> 04:40.000
Kind of what made me think of Overwatch is that it's trying to do these very strong kind of character designs, which I'm standing, Buttercup.

04:40.000 --> 04:41.000
Thank you very much.

04:41.000 --> 04:43.000
But, otherwise, you know, I kind of...

04:43.000 --> 04:49.000
As is the case with a lot of these game announcements and game previews and trailers and things like this,

04:49.000 --> 04:53.000
it doesn't always necessarily, like, show the actual game in motion.

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
And that's what I really want to see.

04:55.000 --> 04:57.000
Like, what does it look like when you play it?

04:57.000 --> 04:58.000
But it looked kind of neat.

04:58.000 --> 05:00.000
I'm, you know, kind of interested.

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
So, let's see.

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
Ori and the Whisper Wards?

05:04.000 --> 05:05.000
Whispering Woods?

05:05.000 --> 05:06.000
Whispering Woods?

05:06.000 --> 05:07.000
Whispering Woods.

05:07.000 --> 05:08.000
The new Ori game.

05:08.000 --> 05:09.000
And that looked...

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
I mean, the last Ori game is great.

05:11.000 --> 05:14.000
It's kind of like a Metroidvania, if you're not sure where those games are.

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
But, like, the art style is really phenomenal.

05:16.000 --> 05:18.000
Like, obviously, it has that look to it.

05:18.000 --> 05:22.000
And I like that they kind of showed a lot of different boss characters and these different types of varied environments that just...

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
They look like paintings in motion.

05:24.000 --> 05:25.000
It's really, really nice.

05:25.000 --> 05:27.000
I'm sure that game is going to do very well for them.

05:27.000 --> 05:31.000
And then, they started to show from the developers of Minecraft.

05:31.000 --> 05:36.000
And I was like, is this finally the Minecraft 2 that I've been screaming about every year?

05:36.000 --> 05:41.000
They had already shown this at, like, I think the Minecon thing.

05:41.000 --> 05:43.000
They showed this off.

05:43.000 --> 05:45.000
So, this wasn't necessarily a new thing.

05:45.000 --> 05:47.000
But it's like, you know, it's your Minecraft Diablo game.

05:47.000 --> 05:49.000
Which, I'm here for it, TBH.

05:49.000 --> 05:54.000
Because when we get to our gaming weeks, I've been playing a lot of Diablo this week.

05:54.000 --> 05:58.000
And that game is almost as old as Phantasy Star Online 2 in Japan.

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
And here I am still playing it.

06:00.000 --> 06:04.000
But I like the idea of combining it in the Minecraft world.

06:04.000 --> 06:08.000
By the way, speaking of, like, different platforms and things of that nature.

06:08.000 --> 06:15.000
I don't know if you noticed, but at the same time that Microsoft was showing off the Minecraft Dungeons trailer.

06:15.000 --> 06:19.000
Nintendo Switch posted it to their official Facebook page.

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
They posted that same trailer.

06:21.000 --> 06:24.000
So, basically confirming that Minecraft Dungeons will also be on Nintendo Switch.

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
Even though it's a Minecraft game.

06:26.000 --> 06:29.000
Even though it's a Microsoft game.

06:29.000 --> 06:32.000
But, of course, Minecraft was on all those platforms anyway, right?

06:32.000 --> 06:35.000
Well, you know, Steve is totally going to be announced for Smash tomorrow.

06:35.000 --> 06:36.000
So, it's fine.

06:36.000 --> 06:39.000
Or, when's Nintendo? Is that on Tuesday?

06:39.000 --> 06:40.000
It might be Tuesday.

06:40.000 --> 06:43.000
You know, Miyamoto was actually at Microsoft's press conference.

06:43.000 --> 06:47.000
A lot of people were talking, oh my god, Miyamoto's sited there.

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
This Nintendo's in bed with Microsoft.

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
Phantasy's about to come true.

06:51.000 --> 06:57.000
And it turns out, no, it's just actually kind of customary that the competition gets invited to all the pressers.

06:57.000 --> 07:03.000
I want to say, when we went to the Sony event one year, we spotted the guys that were with Microsoft at the time in attendance.

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
Like, it happens.

07:05.000 --> 07:08.000
It's a nicety. It's a formality.

07:08.000 --> 07:11.000
The gaming industry is not that big.

07:11.000 --> 07:14.000
A lot of these people tend to go from one company to the other.

07:14.000 --> 07:18.000
Hell, look at Phil, not to get too ahead of myself, but look at Phil Harrison with the Google Stadia stuff.

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
Where did that guy used to be?

07:20.000 --> 07:21.000
Microsoft, right?

07:21.000 --> 07:23.000
So, you know, these guys will go around the industry.

07:23.000 --> 07:26.000
So, they all still treat each other very nicely.

07:26.000 --> 07:29.000
So, let's see.

07:29.000 --> 07:33.000
Interesting comment from Bobby Black Wolf as we do tape live.

07:33.000 --> 07:37.000
Of course, we tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern at our Twitch channel.

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
twitch.tv slash vog network.

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
And we are right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
And Bobby himself is in chat right now saying,

07:44.000 --> 07:47.000
the gaming companies don't hate each other as much as their fans do.

07:47.000 --> 07:51.000
That's a very, that's what we say, tea.

07:51.000 --> 07:52.000
Tea.

07:52.000 --> 07:53.000
That's very much tea.

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
That's a hot piping cup of tea.

07:55.000 --> 07:56.000
Alright, anyway.

07:56.000 --> 07:57.000
Let's see.

07:57.000 --> 08:00.000
The next bit they showed was Jedi Fallen Order, which was...

08:00.000 --> 08:01.000
Yeah, that looked pretty good.

08:01.000 --> 08:06.000
Had already been touched on at the EA Play event, but it looked really cool in motion.

08:06.000 --> 08:10.000
I don't necessarily always get into those Star Wars games, but that one looked like...

08:10.000 --> 08:14.000
Well, and the other thing is Respawn for a moment.

08:14.000 --> 08:17.000
If we can talk about Respawn, they're really killing it for EA right now.

08:17.000 --> 08:21.000
Between like Apex and I know a lot of people slept on Titanfall,

08:21.000 --> 08:25.000
but I think now people are thinking, oh, I should have maybe go back and appreciate Titanfall.

08:25.000 --> 08:28.000
Like Respawn's doing a lot of great stuff for EA right now.

08:28.000 --> 08:31.000
And this appears to be another one that may do very well.

08:31.000 --> 08:38.000
As long as this doesn't screw up the loot box thing like the last Star Wars game from another studio.

08:38.000 --> 08:41.000
But I think EA's learned their lesson a little bit.

08:41.000 --> 08:42.000
A little bit.

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
I'm not going to say they've completely turned around.

08:44.000 --> 08:47.000
They're certainly not going to make that same mistake again, that's for sure.

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
Let's see.

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
We also, after that, had a game...

08:51.000 --> 08:52.000
Oh, this?

08:52.000 --> 08:57.000
Okay, so the next trailer comes up and it's a forest and the guy's got a flashlight and I'm like,

08:57.000 --> 09:01.000
oh my fucking god, is this a new Alan Wake game because I'm about to lose my shit.

09:01.000 --> 09:06.000
But then the trailer gets a little intense for what I think Alan Wake would usually be.

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
So I'm like, okay, I don't think this is actually Alan Wake.

09:08.000 --> 09:13.000
And it turns out it's a setup for a Blair Witch game,

09:13.000 --> 09:18.000
which looks like it's not like, you know, they're not going to make a video game based on a movie from 20...

09:18.000 --> 09:21.000
It would literally be 20 years ago at this point, my god.

09:21.000 --> 09:26.000
Because actually I think that movie had a video game on like PS1 or PC or something.

09:26.000 --> 09:30.000
But I think it's just the myth.

09:30.000 --> 09:35.000
But then again, they have like, you know, Friday the 13th game.

09:35.000 --> 09:42.000
And they also have other like, you know, serial killer games or, you know, movie horror mascot games.

09:42.000 --> 09:43.000
No, super good point.

09:43.000 --> 09:44.000
Dead by Daylight.

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
Yeah, Dead by Daylight brings back like all the greatest hits in that game.

09:46.000 --> 09:50.000
So like, you know, horror movies tend to get revisited in gaming.

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
That's not a new concept.

09:52.000 --> 09:56.000
But I think with Friday the 13th, you know, that was more like an arena type of game.

09:56.000 --> 09:57.000
You know, it's...

09:57.000 --> 10:00.000
This is more like atmospheric, more like slender type stuff.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.000
Plot thing going on.

10:01.000 --> 10:02.000
Yeah.

10:02.000 --> 10:05.000
We were actually doing a live chat at a VoG network on Twitch.

10:05.000 --> 10:10.000
So we like hosted the stream that had like our own chat room that you could actually read the comments as opposed to going like this.

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
Like the official chats do with all the emotes and everything.

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
With all the emotes for clowns.

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
Which I see you're watching Bethesda.

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
And all I can see in that chat over there is emotes.

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
Clowns, it's clowns.

10:20.000 --> 10:21.000
Clowns everywhere.

10:21.000 --> 10:22.000
Clowns everywhere.

10:22.000 --> 10:27.000
But we were watching it on our own channel and I saw people going, is it Silent Hill?

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
Like what is this going on here?

10:29.000 --> 10:33.000
And I was like, well, that would be a twist if there's a Silent Hill game on the Xbox.

10:33.000 --> 10:34.000
But no, it's the Blair Witch thing.

10:34.000 --> 10:35.000
But that's cool.

10:35.000 --> 10:39.000
Like I, you know, say what you want about where that franchise ended up.

10:39.000 --> 10:48.000
When that movie first came out, if you're too young to remember, when that movie first came out, that movie mind fucked people in the biggest way.

10:48.000 --> 10:51.000
Because the internet wasn't like everywhere yet.

10:51.000 --> 10:54.000
So not everybody knew that that movie was fake.

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
And they really tried to sell it off as real.

10:56.000 --> 10:59.000
Like that was the first like found footage horror movie.

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
Not the, but the first that took off the way it did.

11:01.000 --> 11:02.000
You know what I mean?

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
So it's interesting to see them revisit that I think.

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
So pretty cool.

11:06.000 --> 11:11.000
Anyway, after the Blair Witch was Cyberpunk 2077 and all the footage.

11:11.000 --> 11:12.000
Which looks amazing.

11:12.000 --> 11:16.000
Yeah, you know, I haven't been following the Cyberpunk stuff super closely.

11:16.000 --> 11:21.000
But you know, you can definitely tell a lot of that cinematography from what you'd see with The Witcher.

11:21.000 --> 11:27.000
You know, and a lot of the really amazing graphical style you can see comes into play with that.

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
And it looked really good.

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
It was announced for a release in 2020.

11:31.000 --> 11:33.000
So it's not going to happen this year.

11:33.000 --> 11:38.000
But hopefully with the 2020 release, we're not talking about crunch time or any of that stuff.

11:38.000 --> 11:43.000
But what made me happy was the little footage of Keanu Reeves at the end.

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
Which I think made a lot of people go, whoa.

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
Because I don't think people knew that was coming, right?

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
So we got to see the Keanu Reeves.

11:49.000 --> 11:52.000
And then out from backstage, Keanu Reeves.

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
He's there and he does his little spiel.

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
He's being very Keanu Reeves.

11:56.000 --> 11:57.000
He's very endearing.

11:57.000 --> 11:58.000
The audience loves him.

11:58.000 --> 11:59.000
He gets heckled.

11:59.000 --> 12:03.000
But in the most Sesame Street kind of way.

12:03.000 --> 12:07.000
Where somebody from the audience says, you're breathtaking.

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
And Keanu goes, no, you're breathtaking.

12:09.000 --> 12:13.000
And it's just like the loveliest verbal pillow fight you've ever seen.

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
It was a very pure wholesome E3 moment.

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
Which we don't usually get enough of.

12:17.000 --> 12:21.000
So yeah, I was not expecting that with Cyberpunk 2077.

12:21.000 --> 12:25.000
But it did look, it looks like a pretty compelling game.

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
So I'm sure a lot of people are going to be very into that.

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
Let's see, moving on.

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
Actually going to a question here.

12:31.000 --> 12:36.000
Black Mamba 1977 in chat says, do you think they'll ever make an Alan Wake game that's multi-platform?

12:36.000 --> 12:39.000
I miss that game but don't want to get a new Xbox.

12:39.000 --> 12:40.000
No hate to the console.

12:40.000 --> 12:43.000
The Xbox hasn't been kind to me console wise.

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
Well also one thing to keep in mind.

12:45.000 --> 12:48.000
I don't know if it would go to PlayStation.

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
But it'll go to PC.

12:50.000 --> 12:53.000
If you have a PC that's strong enough to play it.

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
Is what I would say today.

12:55.000 --> 12:58.000
But this whole xCloud thing of the future.

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
They didn't get into that too much.

13:00.000 --> 13:04.000
No, it seems like it's more of just like kind of like remote play.

13:04.000 --> 13:05.000
Like how that was with.

13:05.000 --> 13:09.000
But then they also said that it's either your console or it's the cloud.

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
I think, not to get too ahead of ourselves.

13:11.000 --> 13:17.000
But I think the reason, my guess for that is that if you have a Project Scarlett console.

13:17.000 --> 13:21.000
It's going to render everything and do all that stuff in real time and all that good stuff.

13:21.000 --> 13:24.000
But if you don't have a Project Scarlett console, you have an Xbox One console.

13:24.000 --> 13:29.000
You use the cloud thing to play the game on the Xbox One console.

13:29.000 --> 13:32.000
And it's their processing power but it's on your Xbox One.

13:32.000 --> 13:35.000
So what they're probably going to say is you can buy this new console.

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
Or you can just keep your original console and play these new games.

13:37.000 --> 13:40.000
But you'll have to be connected to the internet to play these new games.

13:40.000 --> 13:45.000
And I would imagine that the Xbox One will be able to read those discs somehow.

13:45.000 --> 13:48.000
So it will still know you have a copy of that game in there.

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
Because that would be kind of interesting, wouldn't it?

13:50.000 --> 13:54.000
That if you're paying for a game and it's a disc that will work on a Project Scarlett.

13:54.000 --> 14:01.000
But if you put it in an Xbox One, it unlocks the game on xCloud for you to play while the disc is in there.

14:01.000 --> 14:04.000
Which is how backwards compatibility kind of works today.

14:04.000 --> 14:08.000
You're not playing it in the cloud, but you still have to have your 360 disc in the Xbox One.

14:08.000 --> 14:11.000
That unlocks what you're playing a digital copy of the game.

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
Kind of like that, I think.

14:15.000 --> 14:16.000
Any thoughts?

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
I don't know if that's how it's going to work, but we'll see.

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
There's still a lot to be explained there, that's for sure.

14:20.000 --> 14:25.000
Other games. Spiritfarer, which looked kind of cute and artsy.

14:25.000 --> 14:29.000
It looked a little mobile to me, but I'd be curious about more.

14:29.000 --> 14:32.000
Because it looked kind of like a building game and so forth.

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
And then Battletoads showed up.

14:34.000 --> 14:37.000
So finally we got to see what Battletoads actually looks like in motion.

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
They're going for a very cartoony style.

14:39.000 --> 14:42.000
Not like Cuphead cartoony, but very like, you know...

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
Modern DuckTales or...

14:44.000 --> 14:48.000
DuckTales or Castle Crashers. It looked a lot like Castle Crashers to me, but like Battletoads.

14:48.000 --> 14:52.000
So that kind of made me go, is this a $60 game?

14:52.000 --> 14:55.000
Because this looks like Castle Crashers, which was like a $20 game.

14:55.000 --> 15:00.000
So I'm not sure we saw enough of Battletoads if it's going to be a full game.

15:00.000 --> 15:04.000
But at the same time, and this is something important we have to keep in the back of our heads.

15:04.000 --> 15:11.000
Microsoft doesn't necessarily always want us thinking about, it's a $20 game, it's a $60 game.

15:11.000 --> 15:15.000
Microsoft wants you thinking about, I get to play this with my Game Pass subscription.

15:15.000 --> 15:16.000
Exactly.

15:16.000 --> 15:24.000
So maybe this whole, is it $20? Maybe that whole debate is going to be a thing of the past before too long.

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
I don't know. Anyway.

15:27.000 --> 15:31.000
Let's see, what else? After Battletoads was the...

15:31.000 --> 15:34.000
They got into RPG Time, The Legend of Right.

15:34.000 --> 15:37.000
That was like the notepad sketch looking game that looks like...

15:37.000 --> 15:38.000
Yeah, it looked pretty cool.

15:38.000 --> 15:42.000
Yeah, it looked complicated. There was a lot of stuff going on in that UI.

15:42.000 --> 15:46.000
It was a messy UI, but I'm sure the game walks you through it a little bit.

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
So I would like to know more.

15:48.000 --> 15:51.000
ID at Xbox, where they kind of rapid fire went through...

15:51.000 --> 15:55.000
This is how they get 60 games at you. They rapid fire go through the indie games that are being developed.

15:55.000 --> 16:00.000
I didn't catch them all. I only caught the one that was called Supermarket Shriek, because that made me laugh.

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
Yeah, that's the one with the goat. I remember that.

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
Yes, that one made me laugh.

16:04.000 --> 16:08.000
And then they talked about Xbox Game Pass for a little bit.

16:08.000 --> 16:16.000
They talked about Xbox Game Pass on PC, which I have to be honest, the games that they were spotlighting for Xbox games on PC didn't exactly make me go,

16:17.000 --> 16:21.000
but I think they were trying to pick things that maybe don't exist on Xbox One.

16:21.000 --> 16:25.000
Does Football Manager 19, is that something you can play on your Xbox One? I don't think it is.

16:25.000 --> 16:26.000
I don't know.

16:26.000 --> 16:32.000
So I think they were trying to maybe pick things that were kind of PC specific, but then there's a lot of overlap with the Xbox One.

16:32.000 --> 16:39.000
But then they showed that, they reiterated the Xbox One version, and then they came out and said,

16:39.000 --> 16:45.000
we're going to offer you this Xbox Ultimate Pass for $14.99.

16:45.000 --> 16:55.000
We're going to have an Xbox Pass that is the Xbox Game Pass for the system, for the PC, and Xbox Gold for $14.99 a month.

16:55.000 --> 16:58.000
And even you asked this when you came in here tonight, and I think a lot of people have been asking,

16:58.000 --> 17:05.000
well, we knew Microsoft was looking at doing this bundle, but isn't $14.99 the cost of just Game Pass today and Gold?

17:05.000 --> 17:11.000
Yes. So now what they did to sweeten the pot is that they're throwing in PC Game Pass, which as I understand is still separate,

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
is part of that $14.99.

17:13.000 --> 17:16.000
I've got to admit, I think I'm going to do it.

17:16.000 --> 17:23.000
And I heard something about that it's actually a dollar a month promotional pricing if you still have an active Xbox Gold.

17:23.000 --> 17:27.000
Because right now I'm paid through February on my Xbox plan.

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
Because you buy that annually, right?

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
So I heard something about you get a dollar a month.

17:31.000 --> 17:36.000
Don't quote me on this. I haven't read all the terms and conditions, but at least you get a little bit of a dollar a month for a little bit of that.

17:36.000 --> 17:40.000
And I've got to admit, I think I'm going to do it.

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
Why not?

17:42.000 --> 17:50.000
There's a lot of games that I'm spending $60 on when they come out, like Forza Horizon and stuff, that I think I just would sign up for the Game Pass.

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
I'm playing that way, to be honest.

17:52.000 --> 17:55.000
So, anyway.

17:55.000 --> 17:59.000
Let's see, I'm looking in our chat here for some other comments.

17:59.000 --> 18:03.000
Tigerclaw does point out, as far as Battletoads goes, it did show new speeder bike levels.

18:03.000 --> 18:06.000
Sure, it did. And yeah, I remember how those levels were notorious.

18:06.000 --> 18:11.000
Sure, instead of like a third person, though, it was like a first person.

18:11.000 --> 18:16.000
No, it was still third person, but it was just instead of being side scrolling, it was going into...

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
Oh yeah, it was more like over the shoulder.

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah. For sure.

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
It can be less annoying.

18:22.000 --> 18:26.000
Let's see, and then they showed a new flight simulator.

18:26.000 --> 18:31.000
They showed Microsoft Flight Simulator, which again, not a series you always associate with Xbox.

18:31.000 --> 18:36.000
I think those flight simulator games were always very PC-centric, but it looked gorgeous.

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
It really looked good.

18:38.000 --> 18:42.000
And I was just sitting there the whole time going, but I'm not good at the simulator part.

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
Can I just press F to fly?

18:44.000 --> 18:48.000
And apparently Bobby Blackwell says yes, there is a Bobby Blackwell mode in flight simulator.

18:48.000 --> 18:52.000
So you can just fly the damn plane and enjoy the scenery, which I think will be lovely.

18:52.000 --> 18:59.000
And again, if that's a part of Game Pass, for me, I'm like, okay, I wouldn't have thought of dropping $60 on flight simulator,

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
but like pay in the 15 a month.

19:01.000 --> 19:04.000
Does it have a VR mode? Because that would be awesome.

19:04.000 --> 19:08.000
Interesting enough, VR AR completely left out of Microsoft's conversation today.

19:08.000 --> 19:11.000
It's just, you know, we talked a little bit about this at the end of Bobby's show.

19:11.000 --> 19:15.000
It's just not something they're doing with Xbox right now, it seems.

19:15.000 --> 19:20.000
But, you know, had Sony gone to E3 this year, I'm sure VR would have been a part of their conversation.

19:20.000 --> 19:25.000
So it is just an interesting little unique difference between the two consoles right now is that, you know,

19:25.000 --> 19:30.000
Microsoft is really focusing on this games and PC and Xbox are their platforms,

19:30.000 --> 19:35.000
whereas Sony is looking at games with PlayStation and VR enhanced is kind of their world right now.

19:35.000 --> 19:39.000
So you're kind of starting to see a little more of a division between those two, for sure.

19:39.000 --> 19:46.000
So after flight simulator was the new Age of Empires game, Age of Empires II, which I have to admit, I don't get it.

19:46.000 --> 19:50.000
As into those games I do Civ, but I know those games have their fans, so I'm sure they were very happy.

19:50.000 --> 19:56.000
Wasteland 3 was shown as well, which, again, not a series I've gotten into yet,

19:56.000 --> 19:59.000
but I thought they did a good job with the trailer.

19:59.000 --> 20:02.000
I'm trying to pick up the pace a little bit here because I have a lot to get through.

20:02.000 --> 20:06.000
Big shoe dropping, Double Fine acquired by Xbox.

20:06.000 --> 20:10.000
As if all of their acquisitions last year weren't enough, they came out and said,

20:10.000 --> 20:13.000
not only did we acquire all of them, we got one more, Double Fine.

20:13.000 --> 20:17.000
Some pressed people on my Twitter feed about that, not happy about that one.

20:17.000 --> 20:22.000
But I have to admit, I'm trying to come from that perspective of, to me,

20:22.000 --> 20:29.000
it's because the reason why a lot of people are oppressed is because the Double Fine fans, some that I know, are like,

20:29.000 --> 20:34.000
dang it, I like Psychonauts, I like those games, those are the types of games I want to play,

20:34.000 --> 20:40.000
I don't want to have to go to freaking Xbox, I don't like Xbox because they don't have my kind of games.

20:40.000 --> 20:44.000
Well, y'all, that's why Microsoft did it.

20:44.000 --> 20:49.000
Microsoft's trying to win those people over because you don't like Microsoft

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
because they don't have those kind of games. Well, guess what?

20:51.000 --> 20:54.000
They just bought to get those kind of games.

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
That's their strategy.

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
Maybe on PC too, I'm sure.

20:58.000 --> 21:01.000
Yeah, and I'm sure a lot of folks will enjoy Psychonauts 2 on PC and so forth,

21:01.000 --> 21:06.000
which is also interesting that Psychonauts 2 is now so closely related with Microsoft

21:06.000 --> 21:11.000
when the first one didn't go so well, because the first one was supposed to be an Xbox exclusive.

21:11.000 --> 21:19.000
But also, I think we know the folks that are running Xbox completely different from what it used to be.

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
I mean, props to Phil Spencer, am I right?

21:21.000 --> 21:24.000
Phil Spencer has turned the Xbox One ship around.

21:24.000 --> 21:27.000
He should really be commended, so good job, Phil Spencer.

21:27.000 --> 21:30.000
Especially considering to who they used to have.

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
I mean, he's been miles and light years beyond.

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
I feel like Phil Spencer gets it.

21:34.000 --> 21:38.000
Phil Spencer is like a gamer, whereas the last guy was an executive, you know what I mean?

21:38.000 --> 21:41.000
So, kudos to Phil Spencer, honestly.

21:41.000 --> 21:43.000
Let's see.

21:43.000 --> 21:46.000
Going on to more games.

21:46.000 --> 21:49.000
The Lego Star Wars Skywalker Saga.

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
All nine games in one.

21:51.000 --> 21:54.000
But it's not like a compilation. It's a brand new game.

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
No, it's a brand new game. It's all nine movies in one.

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
Yeah, that'd be cool.

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
That seems a little cluster fucky to me, but

22:00.000 --> 22:03.000
Lego has their unique sense of humor and their unique way of doing things.

22:03.000 --> 22:04.000
I'm sure it'll be fine.

22:04.000 --> 22:05.000
Yeah, it'll be fine.

22:05.000 --> 22:06.000
Yeah, it'll be fine.

22:06.000 --> 22:09.000
And then they showed the Project Z, the Dragon Ball Z Kakarot.

22:09.000 --> 22:11.000
I don't know if I said that right. Sorry, guys.

22:11.000 --> 22:14.000
I don't really play a lot of the Dragon Ball Z stuff,

22:14.000 --> 22:18.000
but I think it's cool that Microsoft is showcasing something like that

22:18.000 --> 22:22.000
because that, again, is the type of game that you don't always associate with Microsoft,

22:22.000 --> 22:26.000
but here they are giving a pretty decent chunk of time to it, so I thought that was very interesting.

22:26.000 --> 22:29.000
So, from a strategical perspective, I was kind of into that.

22:29.000 --> 22:32.000
And then after that, they showed, actually, the game that really...

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
This was one of the standouts for me.

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
12 Minutes was the game after that.

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
It's an Annapurna Studios game.

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
It was a time loop thriller game.

22:40.000 --> 22:43.000
So, she was like, oh, I got you a present, and he goes,

22:43.000 --> 22:46.000
I already know what's in the box, and you killed your dad,

22:46.000 --> 22:49.000
and a guy's coming through that door, and it was very scary.

22:49.000 --> 22:52.000
Which time loops are all the rage right now. Have you seen Russian Dolls?

22:52.000 --> 22:56.000
There was another game during the Bethesda conference that's also based around a time loop.

22:56.000 --> 22:57.000
Oh, what did they...

22:57.000 --> 22:58.000
It's called Deathloop.

22:58.000 --> 23:03.000
Oh, so another time... Time loops are in. Time loops are the new battle royale.

23:03.000 --> 23:05.000
Where's my time loop, Fallout 76?

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
Be careful. Be careful what you wish for.

23:10.000 --> 23:13.000
Alright, and then they showed a game called Way to the Woods,

23:13.000 --> 23:18.000
which, like, you played as this moose that was using their antlers to, like, smash windows and things,

23:18.000 --> 23:23.000
and I was reminded of Tokyo Jungle randomly, but the art style was very different and very cool.

23:23.000 --> 23:27.000
But I also won a sequel to Tokyo Jungle, so PlayStation 5 made that happen.

23:28.000 --> 23:32.000
And then they got into the Gears Pop mobile game, right?

23:33.000 --> 23:34.000
Cute.

23:34.000 --> 23:39.000
State of Decay 2, which I see another zombie game and my eyes kind of glaze over.

23:39.000 --> 23:42.000
Well, it's State of Decay 2, I think it's an expansion to that.

23:42.000 --> 23:47.000
Yeah, but I see another zombie, my eyes glaze over, but I thought it was a well-done trailer.

23:47.000 --> 23:50.000
It looked interesting. I was like, okay, this looks like it might be interesting.

23:51.000 --> 23:55.000
And then they show Phantasy Star Online 2, and I melted, I died, I was resurrected.

23:55.000 --> 24:01.000
No, there's a part of me, like, don't get me wrong, I am really excited about Phantasy Star Online 2 happening,

24:01.000 --> 24:10.000
but I've hit that it's been so long, I kind of go, well, what are they going to do to, like, A, catch up, B,

24:10.000 --> 24:16.000
a lot of people have already visited Phantasy Star Online 2, how are they going to make this now a game for 2019?

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
That's kind of what I'm curious about, you know what I mean?

24:18.000 --> 24:19.000
Yeah.

24:19.000 --> 24:24.000
Or are they just going to kind of rest on their laurels and hope that we kind of eat up what they've delivered seven years ago in another country?

24:24.000 --> 24:33.000
But I'm really excited to check it out for sure, so don't get me wrong, I'm just like, it's kind of like one of those sighs of relief,

24:33.000 --> 24:36.000
like, finally, this is happening, I just hope it's done well.

24:36.000 --> 24:41.000
I was kind of surprised it didn't, I would have thought if Phantasy Star Online 2 was going to happen,

24:41.000 --> 24:47.000
I'm surprised it wasn't a Nintendo Switch thing, which, yes, I know the Switch does the whole cloud gaming thing,

24:47.000 --> 24:53.000
but still, it's on the Switch overseas, it's on PlayStation overseas, I'm kind of surprised now it's Xbox over here,

24:53.000 --> 25:01.000
that alone is interesting in how it changes the conversation, but it should be noted, Phantasy Star Universe,

25:01.000 --> 25:05.000
which a lot of y'all slept on, you didn't like it as much as Phantasy Star Online, I thought it was alright,

25:05.000 --> 25:10.000
Phantasy Star Universe was an Xbox 360 game, Phantasy Star Universe was not PlayStation, Phantasy Star Universe was not Nintendo's platform,

25:10.000 --> 25:16.000
so Microsoft does have a precedent of supporting the series, there is that.

25:16.000 --> 25:22.000
After that, they hyped this series that I guess tons of people around the world play,

25:22.000 --> 25:26.000
and I have to note, I didn't, Crossfire X, I didn't...

25:26.000 --> 25:27.000
It's in Korea, I think.

25:27.000 --> 25:32.000
Okay, that's, I'm like, it has to be a game overseas that's huge, and remember,

25:32.000 --> 25:37.000
Microsoft does business in many other places than just North America, so I'm sure they had...

25:37.000 --> 25:43.000
I forget where it's from, it's either China or Korea, and it's basically of the size of Fortnite over there.

25:43.000 --> 25:45.000
Bobby says it's Korea's Counter-Strike.

25:45.000 --> 25:46.000
Counter-Strike, yeah.

25:46.000 --> 25:47.000
Yeah, basically.

25:47.000 --> 25:54.000
So, let's see, and then after that was Tales of Arise, so Tales of Symphonia, Tales of...

25:54.000 --> 25:59.000
So it's like Namco, Bandai's JRPG, looks really nice, actually, the art style looks really cool,

25:59.000 --> 26:03.000
and I'm always glad to see RPGs on Xbox, that's a great thing.

26:03.000 --> 26:07.000
Then they show Borderlands 3, which I'm sure you have more opinions on.

26:07.000 --> 26:11.000
Yeah, it looks good, I mean, it's a kind of similar trailer, except I did laugh when, you know,

26:11.000 --> 26:15.000
Claptrap is trying to chase after the gun with legs and it runs up the stairs,

26:15.000 --> 26:18.000
because that's, you know, his greatest weakness, his stairs.

26:18.000 --> 26:19.000
Yeah.

26:19.000 --> 26:20.000
He's like, no!

26:20.000 --> 26:21.000
And it's hilarious.

26:21.000 --> 26:27.000
Did you think it was interesting how they would bleep words, because they bleeped Claptrap in that,

26:27.000 --> 26:30.000
and they bleeped a lot of stuff in the Cyberpunk 2077?

26:30.000 --> 26:34.000
It's only in that broadcast, because I think it's family-friendly and it goes on the Xbox as well,

26:34.000 --> 26:38.000
but if you actually watch the trailer outside of that, like, I would rewatch the Cyberpunk trailer,

26:38.000 --> 26:39.000
and it's not.

26:39.000 --> 26:40.000
It's just...

26:40.000 --> 26:44.000
But what was, okay, but, like, family-friendly, did you see all that violence,

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
and did you catch the finger in the Cyberpunk thing?

26:46.000 --> 26:51.000
Like, I wouldn't say it was family-friendly, they just bleeped the language, which I thought was weird.

26:51.000 --> 26:54.000
Well, some people are more offended by language than blood.

26:54.000 --> 26:58.000
Okay, there's a whole commentary just waiting in there, but I'm gonna leave it at that,

26:58.000 --> 27:02.000
because it's a three-hour show, we don't have enough time if I get on that tangent.

27:02.000 --> 27:07.000
So, the next game that they showed was Elden Ring,

27:07.000 --> 27:12.000
and this is the big Miyazaki and R.R. Martin, George R.R. Martin coming together.

27:12.000 --> 27:13.000
Lots of people will die.

27:13.000 --> 27:16.000
Yes, lots of people, your faves will be killed.

27:16.000 --> 27:22.000
But the trailer was very cinematic, of course, no actual game to be seen there,

27:22.000 --> 27:25.000
but I'm sure that's not gonna stop the hype machine for a lot of people.

27:25.000 --> 27:27.000
It looks good, I don't know what it is.

27:27.000 --> 27:31.000
Yeah, I know, I'm curious to hear more, but it's very early on right now.

27:31.000 --> 27:37.000
And then, after that, the rest of the time was spent on the new console.

27:37.000 --> 27:39.000
So, not everybody was expecting this.

27:39.000 --> 27:42.000
Did we talk about the Forza Horizon Lego thing?

27:42.000 --> 27:45.000
Oh, I skipped over it, I'm sorry, you're right.

27:45.000 --> 27:47.000
Forza, how could I miss that, Bobby?

27:47.000 --> 27:50.000
Forza Horizon 4's Lego expansion, yeah, looks great.

27:50.000 --> 27:51.000
Which comes out this week.

27:51.000 --> 27:53.000
Yeah, and it's like right now, too.

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
I was saying they could make a whole other game out of that.

27:55.000 --> 27:56.000
They should.

27:56.000 --> 27:57.000
Honestly, I'm kind of surprised.

27:57.000 --> 28:00.000
It's kind of interesting because where it's like Battletoads is one of those,

28:00.000 --> 28:04.000
like, oh, they're gonna maybe charge full price for this game

28:04.000 --> 28:07.000
that may be more like an online thing.

28:07.000 --> 28:11.000
They could probably get away with doing a whole Lego spin-off Horizon game themselves

28:11.000 --> 28:15.000
and get away with it, but no, it's DLC.

28:15.000 --> 28:17.000
Anything else I missed?

28:20.000 --> 28:23.000
No, I think that was it.

28:23.000 --> 28:26.000
Yeah, Bobby Blackwolf pointing out, after all the how dare yous,

28:26.000 --> 28:29.000
we also thought Hot Wheels could have been its own game.

28:29.000 --> 28:34.000
And SSG100Matt over at twitch.tv slash vlog network says, Lego, all the things.

28:34.000 --> 28:37.000
Yes, there was a lot of Lego in that Crest Commons, wasn't there?

28:37.000 --> 28:41.000
What I really liked in that trailer, obviously it looks great,

28:41.000 --> 28:44.000
but I really like that remix of Everything is Awesome

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
that sounded like a song you would hear in Forza Horizon.

28:46.000 --> 28:50.000
It was like a Eurotrance type of version of that song.

28:50.000 --> 28:51.000
It was awesome.

28:51.000 --> 28:53.000
Then we got into the new console,

28:53.000 --> 28:57.000
which they did not give a further name to beyond Project Scarlet,

28:57.000 --> 28:59.000
which obviously will not be the final name,

28:59.000 --> 29:01.000
but they're still referring to it as Project Scarlet.

29:01.000 --> 29:06.000
And we had a little talking head piece about people hyping up the console.

29:06.000 --> 29:10.000
Very interesting in that talking head piece that we ticked all the boxes

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
that Sony has ticked so far.

29:12.000 --> 29:15.000
And they're tiny, tiny little, hey, we invited somebody into our office

29:15.000 --> 29:18.000
before they did a leak story on this.

29:18.000 --> 29:22.000
So the SSD drive, check, Microsoft's doing it too.

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
GDDR6 RAM.

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
Ray tracing, all that stuff checked off.

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
Zen 2 architecture.

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
So Microsoft level set.

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
What Sony's doing, we're doing.

29:32.000 --> 29:33.000
So we're on the same page.

29:33.000 --> 29:37.000
Now Microsoft took it one step further by showing you

29:37.000 --> 29:39.000
here's what ray tracing looks like.

29:39.000 --> 29:42.000
And we got maybe 30 seconds of glimpse

29:42.000 --> 29:45.000
at these random things that were running.

29:45.000 --> 29:50.000
I remember a scenery shot of these wildlife in an environmental thing,

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
and it kind of showed the ray tracing in action.

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
Looked really nice, right?

29:54.000 --> 29:55.000
So we got those little glimpses.

29:55.000 --> 29:59.000
And then, of course, a big glimpse at Halo Infinite,

29:59.000 --> 30:02.000
which is going to be their big kickoff title,

30:02.000 --> 30:06.000
taking a page from the original Xbox and launching with a Halo game.

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
Have a good strong title to launch the system with.

30:08.000 --> 30:12.000
Or one might say taking a page from Nintendo,

30:12.000 --> 30:15.000
who launched the Switch with Breath of the Wild.

30:15.000 --> 30:19.000
Because Halo Infinite, I mean, Microsoft has said before,

30:19.000 --> 30:20.000
am I right?

30:20.000 --> 30:25.000
You can play any game they announce from now on on your Xbox One, right?

30:25.000 --> 30:27.000
Because it's probably going to be this whole cloud thing.

30:27.000 --> 30:30.000
So Halo Infinite will be for the past console,

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
but it's also going to be the kickoff for the new console.

30:32.000 --> 30:33.000
Yeah.

30:33.000 --> 30:35.000
And it will...

30:35.000 --> 30:40.000
I mean, it wasn't very Halo-y, what we saw, but it was well done.

30:40.000 --> 30:41.000
Yeah.

30:41.000 --> 30:46.000
Especially that scene when the little princess Leia hologram type thing was coming in.

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
Just look at the detail on that.

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
It looked really amazingly detailed on that whole thing.

30:50.000 --> 30:51.000
Yeah.

30:51.000 --> 30:52.000
So that was good.

30:52.000 --> 30:53.000
And then, of course, you do see the Master Chief,

30:53.000 --> 30:56.000
and you saw what I thought was going to be the tutorial.

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
I thought it was going to suddenly take over,

30:58.000 --> 31:01.000
because it was a good setup for now that we've got you plugged in,

31:01.000 --> 31:03.000
let's make sure you're working again.

31:03.000 --> 31:04.000
Look over here.

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
Use RS to move.

31:06.000 --> 31:07.000
Now look over here.

31:07.000 --> 31:08.000
Well, it could be in the game.

31:08.000 --> 31:11.000
But maybe it jumped a few steps ahead.

31:11.000 --> 31:12.000
I don't know.

31:12.000 --> 31:17.000
But yeah, that was pretty hot, that Halo Infinite look.

31:17.000 --> 31:19.000
So that was everything for Microsoft.

31:19.000 --> 31:21.000
I know I talked a lot about that, but there was a lot to digest.

31:21.000 --> 31:25.000
So overall, you thought it was pretty good.

31:25.000 --> 31:26.000
I thought it was pretty good too.

31:26.000 --> 31:27.000
Yeah, I think they did a good job.

31:27.000 --> 31:28.000
I think they did too.

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
I don't think they did anything that was like,

31:30.000 --> 31:34.000
oh shit, Sony's going to regret not coming this year.

31:34.000 --> 31:39.000
There wasn't a lot of, I think, unexpected titles from them.

31:39.000 --> 31:43.000
It was kind of like showing you some more stuff that we've seen already.

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
I mean, we've already seen a lot of those.

31:45.000 --> 31:47.000
It's not like brand new, like this is a...

31:47.000 --> 31:49.000
Fantasy Star Online 2 was unexpected.

31:49.000 --> 31:53.000
It was unexpected, but it wasn't something from what our studios are working on,

31:53.000 --> 31:55.000
exclusive games for us type of thing.

31:55.000 --> 31:56.000
It wasn't anything like that.

31:56.000 --> 31:57.000
But it was fine.

31:57.000 --> 31:58.000
It was all right.

31:58.000 --> 32:02.000
Yeah, I thought they did a very good message of games, games, games, games, games.

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
They really did show a lot,

32:04.000 --> 32:07.000
and especially for what is essentially a lame duck year

32:07.000 --> 32:09.000
for the current gen consoles, right?

32:09.000 --> 32:10.000
That's what you call, you know,

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
well, we all know there's a new gen coming,

32:12.000 --> 32:13.000
so this is the last year,

32:13.000 --> 32:15.000
and this is why Sony's kind of taken it off,

32:15.000 --> 32:17.000
because if Sony showed up to E3 this year,

32:17.000 --> 32:18.000
what would they be showing?

32:18.000 --> 32:21.000
Death Stranding, which they've shown a bunch of already.

32:21.000 --> 32:22.000
Last of Us 2.

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
Last of Us 2, which they showed a lot of last year.

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
And the year before that.

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
Yeah, they would show Final Fantasy 7 Remake,

32:28.000 --> 32:29.000
which they've already shown on Square.

32:29.000 --> 32:30.000
It's got their own thing anyway.

32:30.000 --> 32:31.000
Tomorrow, yeah.

32:31.000 --> 32:35.000
So I just think Sony, maybe their bridge games,

32:35.000 --> 32:37.000
they already milked the hype out of those.

32:37.000 --> 32:40.000
I'm surprised we didn't see more Call of Duty Modern Warfare,

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
because you know how they kind of do those like,

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
you know, hey, let's show some of this person,

32:44.000 --> 32:47.000
third party company's game, or something like that.

32:47.000 --> 32:52.000
Or, well, I guess Assassin's Creed will see that in Ubisoft.

32:52.000 --> 32:56.000
Well, yeah, what were you surprised was not there?

32:56.000 --> 33:00.000
I don't really have any expectations,

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
so I guess not really anything.

33:02.000 --> 33:03.000
That's true, lower them expectations, right?

33:03.000 --> 33:05.000
I guess I would say the VR AR thing,

33:05.000 --> 33:08.000
just the fact that they didn't address it at all,

33:08.000 --> 33:09.000
is an interesting thing.

33:09.000 --> 33:11.000
It does definitely show you here's Microsoft,

33:11.000 --> 33:14.000
where they're at, versus here's where Sony's at.

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
I would have liked to have seen some download content

33:16.000 --> 33:19.000
for Crackdown 3, because I really have no reason

33:19.000 --> 33:20.000
to play that game again.

33:20.000 --> 33:23.000
And I'm kind of sad that it's just like was so short

33:23.000 --> 33:25.000
and kind of meh.

33:25.000 --> 33:28.000
Top three out of that whole event.

33:28.000 --> 33:29.000
I'll do mine.

33:29.000 --> 33:31.000
Top three, PSO2, hello.

33:31.000 --> 33:36.000
12 minutes, and the 1499 Ultimate Xbox Pass thing.

33:36.000 --> 33:40.000
I think that's, and especially considering

33:40.000 --> 33:41.000
what we're going to talk about next,

33:41.000 --> 33:44.000
I think Xbox got me on that.

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
But what about your top three?

33:46.000 --> 33:53.000
Cyberpunk 2077, Outer Worlds, and I'd say Borderlands 3.

33:53.000 --> 33:55.000
Good picks, solid picks.

33:55.000 --> 34:00.000
Let's see, Bobby wants to, I guess, reiterate something

34:00.000 --> 34:01.000
he said on Twitter.

34:01.000 --> 34:03.000
Oh, wow, Scarlet News.

34:03.000 --> 34:05.000
I made a tweet during the conference about wanting

34:05.000 --> 34:08.000
to still play 4K Blu-rays and 4K Netflix on Scarlet

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
so it could just replace my Xbox One X.

34:10.000 --> 34:13.000
A Microsoft dev lead that works on xCloud

34:13.000 --> 34:17.000
and the display app replied to me during my show saying,

34:17.000 --> 34:22.000
all good, so 4K UHD Blu-ray player for Scarlet confirmed?

34:22.000 --> 34:23.000
Question, question.

34:23.000 --> 34:24.000
Hooray.

34:24.000 --> 34:25.000
I would think that's the kind of thing

34:25.000 --> 34:27.000
Microsoft doesn't want to confirm right now,

34:27.000 --> 34:31.000
because Microsoft has set the precedent a little bit

34:31.000 --> 34:33.000
that they're willing to go all digital.

34:33.000 --> 34:38.000
So maybe they'll be different versions of Scarlet.

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
Maybe one of them will play Blu-rays

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
because that licensing fee and all that, right?

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
And maybe one of them won't.

34:44.000 --> 34:48.000
You know, theorizing, fantasizing, we'll see, right?

34:48.000 --> 34:49.000
We'll see.

34:49.000 --> 34:50.000
I don't know.

34:50.000 --> 34:54.000
Bobby Black Wolf also noting Forza Motorsport 8

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
as a noticeable thing that wasn't there

34:56.000 --> 34:57.000
that was surprising.

34:57.000 --> 35:00.000
Yeah, you know, you would expect a new Forza game

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
on the, what, odd number years

35:02.000 --> 35:05.000
and a Horizon game on the even number years at this point.

35:05.000 --> 35:08.000
But I think if we know that a new console is coming in 2020,

35:08.000 --> 35:11.000
if those rumors are true that Turn 10,

35:11.000 --> 35:13.000
which I know is Horizon's, folks,

35:13.000 --> 35:19.000
but if they're working on a RPG type of thing and all this,

35:19.000 --> 35:23.000
if all that's true, then maybe Forza's just taken the year off.

35:23.000 --> 35:24.000
Probably.

35:24.000 --> 35:28.000
What I would imagine is going to be, I mean, hello,

35:28.000 --> 35:31.000
ray tracing and top-of-the-line graphics,

35:31.000 --> 35:34.000
that's just begging for Scarlet, the new console.

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
So I think they're just sitting on Motorsport 8

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
for the new console, I think.

35:38.000 --> 35:41.000
Oh, I'm sorry, playground games, not Turn 10.

35:41.000 --> 35:42.000
My bad.

35:42.000 --> 35:45.000
I got them backwards, as people often do.

35:45.000 --> 35:46.000
All right, let's see.

35:46.000 --> 35:49.000
So let's, I guess let's move on, shall we?

35:49.000 --> 35:52.000
Let's get to what else happened during E3 week.

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
The EA Play event also happened.

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
So we had Microsoft's event, we had EA Play.

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
Did you watch EA Play?

35:58.000 --> 36:01.000
I only caught the part with Star Wars in it

36:01.000 --> 36:03.000
because I could care less,

36:03.000 --> 36:06.000
I couldn't care less about the sports stuff,

36:06.000 --> 36:11.000
and I don't play Apex Legends, so I think that was basically it.

36:11.000 --> 36:13.000
I didn't catch it, it was just a bad time for me

36:13.000 --> 36:16.000
because we had Sacramento Pride going on this weekend,

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
and I was hanging out with friends yesterday for that,

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
so I just missed the whole thing.

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
And kind of similar thought, I was like, eh,

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
I mean, if they announce a new Dragon Age or something,

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
I'll see a trailer about that later on.

36:26.000 --> 36:29.000
They didn't, so we didn't miss any of that.

36:29.000 --> 36:33.000
Here's what they did recap at EA Play for E3 2019.

36:33.000 --> 36:35.000
They pretty much focused on six games,

36:35.000 --> 36:37.000
including Star Wars Jedi Fallen Order.

36:37.000 --> 36:39.000
They did the first 15 minutes of gameplay,

36:39.000 --> 36:43.000
and that's all, of course, available on YouTube now in the archives,

36:43.000 --> 36:45.000
if you want to check that out.

36:45.000 --> 36:46.000
They did show more Apex Legends.

36:46.000 --> 36:49.000
There's a new character that they unveiled, Watson.

36:49.000 --> 36:51.000
And there's a new short to go with it,

36:51.000 --> 36:53.000
kind of like when they announce a new Overwatch character.

36:53.000 --> 36:55.000
Yeah, kind of cute the way they did that,

36:55.000 --> 36:58.000
but I think people responding very positively to Watson,

36:58.000 --> 37:02.000
the character, it's bringing a nice new kit for the game.

37:02.000 --> 37:06.000
Also a new weapon from Titanfall 2 that crossed over in Apex Legends,

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
so you're seeing a little bit more of that universe starting to come together.

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
Unless that weapon is Titans, I don't really care.

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
I can't remember what you wish for.

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
And then a ranked mode coming to Apex as well,

37:14.000 --> 37:17.000
which I'm sure surprises nobody, right? Yeah.

37:17.000 --> 37:19.000
They showed Battlefield V.

37:19.000 --> 37:21.000
They showed some new maps.

37:21.000 --> 37:25.000
The Battle of Greece, North Africa map.

37:25.000 --> 37:27.000
There's a classic Battlefield map.

37:27.000 --> 37:30.000
Oh, the North Africa Al-Sudan is a classic map

37:30.000 --> 37:33.000
that mixes up foot, vehicles, and air combat mode.

37:33.000 --> 37:35.000
So, okay.

37:35.000 --> 37:37.000
And then they showed more Star Wars Battlefront II,

37:37.000 --> 37:38.000
just a little bit.

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
Obviously, this game's been out for a while,

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
but they did want to point out that Naboo,

37:42.000 --> 37:45.000
a capital supremacy map, is coming on June 26th,

37:45.000 --> 37:49.000
and there's also the Droideka and the TX-30 tank.

37:49.000 --> 37:51.000
Then they talked a little bit about FIFA 20,

37:51.000 --> 37:53.000
because, of course, EA's got to cover sports,

37:53.000 --> 37:56.000
and despite however you might feel about FIFA,

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
it's like the biggest game in the world.

37:58.000 --> 38:01.000
So they had to talk about FIFA 20, and they did that a little bit.

38:01.000 --> 38:05.000
And Volta is a new mode inside FIFA 20.

38:05.000 --> 38:07.000
It's street-style soccer.

38:07.000 --> 38:09.000
So street soccer, which I have never seen.

38:09.000 --> 38:11.000
They've had FIFA Street, so it makes sense.

38:11.000 --> 38:13.000
I've never seen played here in the States,

38:13.000 --> 38:16.000
but obviously it's a little more worldwide

38:16.000 --> 38:19.000
when we're talking about FIFA.

38:19.000 --> 38:23.000
Madden 20, because, again, they have to show the sports games,

38:23.000 --> 38:26.000
and Madden's one of them, so they showed a little bit of that.

38:26.000 --> 38:29.000
And The Sims 4 is getting a new expansion.

38:29.000 --> 38:33.000
Island Living is the new expansion for Sims 4,

38:33.000 --> 38:37.000
which is still going as we come up on the 20th year of The Sims.

38:37.000 --> 38:39.000
And I was pretty pleasantly surprised

38:39.000 --> 38:42.000
that Sims 4 is still trucking along with all the content.

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
And I've got to admit, I haven't been following the series so closely,

38:44.000 --> 38:47.000
but I know people that do that were excited to hear

38:47.000 --> 38:49.000
that there is still more content coming for the game.

38:49.000 --> 38:51.000
That's pretty cool.

38:51.000 --> 38:54.000
So that, in a nutshell, was EA Play.

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
So I guess...

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
Favorites there? Star Wars, the only thing I saw.

38:58.000 --> 39:02.000
Yeah, and honestly, well, I like Apex enough.

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
I need to play it more. I need to give it a better shot.

39:04.000 --> 39:07.000
So I like that Apex is still trucking along

39:07.000 --> 39:09.000
and that they're doing animated shorts with it.

39:09.000 --> 39:11.000
I think that's pretty cool.

39:11.000 --> 39:16.000
Alright, let's move on and talk about the Pokemon Direct.

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
I'm sure you were excited about this, right?

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
I didn't watch it.

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
I watched kind of like the highlights.

39:22.000 --> 39:25.000
It was on too fucking early to watch it live.

39:25.000 --> 39:28.000
So of course you get all the highlights on Twitter, right?

39:28.000 --> 39:32.000
So we got to see things like the new Pokemon they announced,

39:32.000 --> 39:35.000
such as Wooloo, who is a sheep

39:35.000 --> 39:39.000
and everybody on my Twitter feed seems to be standing Wooloo,

39:39.000 --> 39:41.000
because Wooloo is an adorable little sheep Pokemon.

39:41.000 --> 39:44.000
Mareep is crying that you've all forgotten Mareep already.

39:44.000 --> 39:47.000
Wooloo shipping immediately. It was just ridiculous.

39:47.000 --> 39:50.000
It's like a goddamn sheep, folks.

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
Gossifleur was another Pokemon.

39:52.000 --> 39:55.000
Drednaw. Corviknight, which was kind of a cool little

39:55.000 --> 39:58.000
badass raven knight looking thing.

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
Eldegoss was another one as well.

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
The Wild Area.

40:02.000 --> 40:05.000
A Wild Area is an area that stretches between cities

40:05.000 --> 40:07.000
and different Pokemon appear depending on where you are

40:07.000 --> 40:09.000
and what the weather is like.

40:09.000 --> 40:13.000
You have full 360 degree control over the cameras.

40:13.000 --> 40:16.000
That's a little different than Pokemon games of the past.

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
So now it's a little more of a 3D environment.

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
Breath of the Pokemon.

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
I don't know if I go that far, but certainly...

40:22.000 --> 40:25.000
Can I light fire to the tall grass?

40:25.000 --> 40:27.000
Yeah, it's going to be a big change.

40:27.000 --> 40:32.000
Dynamaxing, which some people don't feel so hot about.

40:32.000 --> 40:35.000
Make my monster grow!

40:35.000 --> 40:38.000
You can make your Pokemon do maximum capabilities,

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
max moves.

40:40.000 --> 40:43.000
You can use it once in a battle and it lasts for three turns.

40:43.000 --> 40:45.000
So this is going to be, you know,

40:45.000 --> 40:48.000
when do you do it and all this is going to be key.

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
They do not call this an evolution.

40:50.000 --> 40:53.000
They don't want to confuse it with Z-moves and make evolutions.

40:53.000 --> 40:56.000
Dynamax. It's the new thing.

40:56.000 --> 40:59.000
Kind of sounds like a weight gain drug, so I guess it's all good.

40:59.000 --> 41:01.000
Max raid battles. This sounded kind of cool

41:01.000 --> 41:03.000
because it sounded like a Pokemon Go kind of thing

41:03.000 --> 41:06.000
that they took and they're putting in the mainline games now

41:06.000 --> 41:10.000
because it's a multiplayer event and what you do in the wild area,

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
different Dynamax Pokemon.

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
And again, I think that's kind of clever because if you think about it,

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
that's how it works in Pokemon Go, right?

41:16.000 --> 41:19.000
You have these supercharged Pokemon that you battle at the raid gyms

41:19.000 --> 41:21.000
and then they come down in size for you to catch.

41:21.000 --> 41:25.000
So in some ways, maybe you can blame Pokemon Go for your Dynamax Pokemon.

41:25.000 --> 41:27.000
I don't know. I don't know.

41:27.000 --> 41:31.000
But anyway, you basically come together and you do a party of four

41:31.000 --> 41:34.000
and the Pokemon stays in the Dynamax form

41:34.000 --> 41:37.000
and so you all basically fight this Pokemon together.

41:37.000 --> 41:39.000
I believe I heard things about NPCs

41:39.000 --> 41:41.000
if you don't have the friends to play with or what have you.

41:41.000 --> 41:43.000
So that sounds kind of neat, though.

41:43.000 --> 41:45.000
It's a neat little different co-op angle

41:45.000 --> 41:49.000
and I think it's really cool that you see how Pokemon Go's influence now.

41:49.000 --> 41:51.000
And then also kind of like with Let's Go,

41:51.000 --> 41:54.000
they also have it where you can see the Pokemon on the map

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
instead of just running into them randomly.

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
Yeah. And then let's see.

41:58.000 --> 42:01.000
New characters, new gyms.

42:01.000 --> 42:03.000
They showed a character named Leon,

42:03.000 --> 42:07.000
a burly blue-haired man that is apparently a celebrity, of course,

42:07.000 --> 42:10.000
and has Charizard following in a lot of places.

42:10.000 --> 42:13.000
So they showed several characters and there's already,

42:13.000 --> 42:16.000
like Milo was one of the characters, a grass-type gym leader,

42:16.000 --> 42:20.000
and I've already seen fan art for Milo that I can't unsee.

42:20.000 --> 42:23.000
You don't follow the same Twitter accounts I do.

42:23.000 --> 42:26.000
Hi, Loki. I've seen things.

42:29.000 --> 42:31.000
Then they, of course, announced the release date.

42:31.000 --> 42:35.000
November 15th, 2019 is the global release day

42:35.000 --> 42:37.000
and they showed the mythical Pokemon.

42:37.000 --> 42:39.000
I'm probably going to mispronounce these, sorry.

42:39.000 --> 42:43.000
Zacian and Zamazenta were shown there

42:43.000 --> 42:46.000
and they were shown in a little fight, fighting each other.

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
I liked Zamazenta a little better

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
because it actually has the shield face

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
and I just thought the color scheme was a little...

42:52.000 --> 42:55.000
Yeah, so I think I might be a little more Pokemon Shield,

42:55.000 --> 42:58.000
but I want to hear a little closer to the date

42:58.000 --> 43:01.000
all the Pokemon that are exclusive in one game versus the other

43:01.000 --> 43:03.000
because I'm sure there will be a bit of a list,

43:03.000 --> 43:06.000
but I'm sure lots of people are going to be picking up this game,

43:06.000 --> 43:08.000
both types.

43:08.000 --> 43:12.000
And knowing my buddy Shane, who I saw in chat already,

43:12.000 --> 43:15.000
he's probably going to buy 17 copies of the game anyway,

43:15.000 --> 43:18.000
so I won't have a problem trading for whatever Pokemon I need.

43:18.000 --> 43:21.000
And he's already correcting me. Legendary, not mythical, my bad.

43:21.000 --> 43:23.000
I thought I said legendary,

43:23.000 --> 43:26.000
but there's just so many Pokemon to be excited about.

43:26.000 --> 43:28.000
So, you're not showing...

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
More excitement about Pokemon, Loki.

43:30.000 --> 43:31.000
Are you going to pick it up?

43:31.000 --> 43:32.000
Maybe, I don't know.

43:32.000 --> 43:33.000
I will, for sure.

43:33.000 --> 43:35.000
I'm excited about a mainline game on the Switch.

43:35.000 --> 43:36.000
I really am.

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
I haven't played any of the mainline games, so I don't know.

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
Really? You should fix that.

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
Alright.

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
S2100matt in chat says,

43:44.000 --> 43:46.000
The dual pack with both games is a lame deal.

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
120 for both games.

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
You get better deals if you buy them individually from retailers.

43:50.000 --> 43:53.000
Some are offering $10 credit for pre-ordering.

43:53.000 --> 43:56.000
Shad Starzik or Shane in our chat is following that up,

43:56.000 --> 43:59.000
saying they will probably add something to sweeten the deal,

43:59.000 --> 44:02.000
like bonus items in game or something.

44:02.000 --> 44:03.000
Maybe a Steelbook.

44:03.000 --> 44:04.000
Yeah.

44:04.000 --> 44:05.000
Or a shiny...

44:05.000 --> 44:06.000
What do you want to bet?

44:06.000 --> 44:07.000
Get shiny Pikachu...

44:07.000 --> 44:09.000
I don't know, I'm pulling some dumb ass.

44:09.000 --> 44:10.000
Get shiny XYZ...

44:10.000 --> 44:14.000
Shiny Wooloo for buying the combo kit or something like that.

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
Maybe that'll be a thing.

44:16.000 --> 44:19.000
Somebody's going to be mad I spoke that into existence, but sorry.

44:19.000 --> 44:21.000
Mistake Theory says,

44:21.000 --> 44:24.000
I always get the second game, so I'm in for shield.

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
That's an interesting way to do it.

44:26.000 --> 44:28.000
Always get the second game listed.

44:28.000 --> 44:29.000
So red and blue.

44:29.000 --> 44:30.000
X and Y.

44:30.000 --> 44:32.000
Kind of an interesting way to do it. I like that.

44:32.000 --> 44:33.000
Alright.

44:33.000 --> 44:35.000
Let's move on to Stadia.

44:35.000 --> 44:36.000
Let's talk about Google Stadia.

44:36.000 --> 44:37.000
You want to talk about Stadia, Loki?

44:37.000 --> 44:39.000
I know you've been keeping an ear on the Bethesda thing,

44:39.000 --> 44:40.000
but they just finished, right?

44:40.000 --> 44:41.000
Yeah.

44:41.000 --> 44:43.000
I didn't really watch the Stadia event.

44:43.000 --> 44:45.000
I just read the press stuff.

44:45.000 --> 44:48.000
So basically they talked a little bit about the service

44:48.000 --> 44:51.000
and everything, what the requirements would be, and pricing, all that stuff.

44:51.000 --> 44:53.000
So Stadia is going to launch in November,

44:53.000 --> 44:56.000
and they have it in 14 different countries.

44:56.000 --> 45:01.000
They said right now they're shooting for 31 games from 21 publishers.

45:01.000 --> 45:05.000
They have this Founders Edition that's $130,

45:05.000 --> 45:08.000
which includes the Stadia controller.

45:08.000 --> 45:12.000
I think one of the Google...

45:12.000 --> 45:13.000
I forget.

45:13.000 --> 45:15.000
The Chromecast type thing.

45:15.000 --> 45:19.000
And then they've also got three months of the Stadia Pro service.

45:19.000 --> 45:25.000
And then I think there's also three months of Stadia Pro for a friend as well,

45:25.000 --> 45:27.000
which is interesting.

45:27.000 --> 45:29.000
That's a clever idea, John.

45:29.000 --> 45:33.000
And then of course some of the games that they are mentioning

45:33.000 --> 45:34.000
were beyond the service.

45:34.000 --> 45:37.000
So from Bethesda, for example, they have Doom Eternal,

45:37.000 --> 45:41.000
Doom 2016, Rage 2, The Elder Scrolls Online,

45:41.000 --> 45:43.000
Wolfenstein Youngblood,

45:43.000 --> 45:45.000
Bungie has Destiny 2,

45:45.000 --> 45:48.000
they've got Thumper on there,

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
Metro Exodus, Grid,

45:50.000 --> 45:53.000
Farming Simulator 19,

45:53.000 --> 45:57.000
Square Enix's Final Fantasy XV,

45:57.000 --> 45:59.000
Tomb Raider Definitive Edition,

45:59.000 --> 46:00.000
Rise of the Tomb Raider,

46:00.000 --> 46:01.000
Shadow of the Tomb Raider,

46:01.000 --> 46:04.000
2K's got NBA 2K, Borderlands 3,

46:04.000 --> 46:06.000
Mortal Kombat 11 is going to be in there,

46:06.000 --> 46:08.000
lots of Ubisoft games.

46:08.000 --> 46:11.000
So it's got a pretty good selection of titles.

46:11.000 --> 46:14.000
But it's not Netflix.

46:14.000 --> 46:15.000
It's not Netflix.

46:15.000 --> 46:17.000
So that Google, that Stadia Pro,

46:17.000 --> 46:18.000
so what that is,

46:18.000 --> 46:21.000
that allows you to do the 4K streaming at 60 frames per second,

46:21.000 --> 46:25.000
and then you also get the surround sound along with that.

46:25.000 --> 46:28.000
There's going to be free games with it,

46:28.000 --> 46:30.000
so I would think like...

46:30.000 --> 46:32.000
PlayStation Plus is kind of nice.

46:32.000 --> 46:33.000
Yeah, PlayStation Plus or something like that.

46:33.000 --> 46:35.000
Destiny 2 is confirmed to be one of those.

46:35.000 --> 46:38.000
But no, you do not get the whole library for free.

46:38.000 --> 46:41.000
There is a mode if you don't want to do 4K streaming,

46:41.000 --> 46:43.000
you can do 1080p streaming for free.

46:43.000 --> 46:46.000
And it's only in stereo as well.

46:46.000 --> 46:48.000
But apparently, you know,

46:48.000 --> 46:52.000
the requirements that you need to actually stream that,

46:52.000 --> 46:54.000
so it's I think 35 megabits down

46:54.000 --> 46:56.000
if you want to do the 4K streaming,

46:56.000 --> 47:01.000
and then anywhere from I think 10 to get the 720p.

47:01.000 --> 47:03.000
And then of course, as Bobby's mentioned,

47:03.000 --> 47:06.000
and as it's on of all our minds,

47:06.000 --> 47:09.000
that's going to eat through your data cap so fast.

47:09.000 --> 47:12.000
With the 4K streaming, you can get 60 hours out of it,

47:12.000 --> 47:14.000
I believe some of the math has been said,

47:14.000 --> 47:16.000
before you hit one terabyte.

47:16.000 --> 47:19.000
Now, you know, this will be a question I think for cable companies to answer as well.

47:19.000 --> 47:22.000
I don't want to necessarily like, you know,

47:22.000 --> 47:25.000
shoot Google in the foot and say this thing is terrible

47:25.000 --> 47:28.000
because, you know, bandwidth caps and so forth.

47:28.000 --> 47:29.000
I see they're trying to get out in front of it.

47:29.000 --> 47:33.000
I mean, it is inevitable, bandwidth caps will raise

47:33.000 --> 47:35.000
because they've risen before.

47:35.000 --> 47:38.000
As we rely more and more on the internet and so forth,

47:38.000 --> 47:41.000
the market is going to force those bandwidth caps to raise.

47:41.000 --> 47:42.000
It's just a question of when.

47:42.000 --> 47:44.000
I don't know if it's going to be later this year.

47:44.000 --> 47:45.000
In fact, I highly doubt it.

47:45.000 --> 47:48.000
So people are going to have to budget that a little bit

47:48.000 --> 47:50.000
if they plan to do 4K gaming.

47:50.000 --> 47:53.000
But I don't know about you, Loki, I don't have a 4K TV.

47:53.000 --> 47:56.000
So if I were to go get a Chromecast and put that and so forth,

47:56.000 --> 47:58.000
I wouldn't be doing it anyway.

47:58.000 --> 48:02.000
But I'm a little more, when it comes to Google Stadia,

48:02.000 --> 48:04.000
like, I want to like it.

48:04.000 --> 48:06.000
There's things about it I do like.

48:06.000 --> 48:08.000
I think the controller is kind of neat.

48:08.000 --> 48:09.000
I like this whole concept.

48:09.000 --> 48:10.000
If you can pick it up everywhere.

48:10.000 --> 48:16.000
I just don't like the idea of paying $60 for this game that,

48:16.000 --> 48:20.000
that's kind of where I think where a lot of the on-live jokes come from, right?

48:20.000 --> 48:23.000
Is that you bought this game full price online

48:23.000 --> 48:25.000
and you don't really own it

48:25.000 --> 48:28.000
because heaven forbid Google Stadia ever go away.

48:28.000 --> 48:33.000
And Google has sunsetted many of their products.

48:33.000 --> 48:40.000
Pour one out for Google Plus or Google Buzz or Google Wave or, right?

48:40.000 --> 48:43.000
So there's, you know, a lot of Google stuff sometimes gets sunsetted.

48:43.000 --> 48:47.000
But at the same time, I don't want to like shit on this and say it's terrible.

48:47.000 --> 48:48.000
I don't think it's terrible.

48:48.000 --> 48:52.000
I just feel like, oh, I just wish they'd opted for a different,

48:52.000 --> 48:55.000
like I wish they would try to strengthen, you know,

48:55.000 --> 48:57.000
especially now that Microsoft's kind of put out this,

48:57.000 --> 48:59.000
this ultimate game pass.

48:59.000 --> 49:02.000
I'm like, well, here's, here's, here's a perfect comparison.

49:02.000 --> 49:06.000
OK, so we're talking Stadia versus Microsoft's offering.

49:06.000 --> 49:11.000
So like I have a modern day PC and I'm willing to pay $10 a month.

49:11.000 --> 49:15.000
I can either get Stadia Plus and I can stream games to that.

49:15.000 --> 49:18.000
But I don't get any sort of game library with that.

49:18.000 --> 49:22.000
Or I could pay $10 a month and go the Microsoft Games Pass route.

49:22.000 --> 49:24.000
And I have a library of hundreds of games

49:24.000 --> 49:27.000
that are constantly getting brand new games added in it.

49:27.000 --> 49:31.000
Why would I want to pay for $10 a month to do 4K streaming for...

49:33.000 --> 49:35.000
I just don't, it doesn't make any sense.

49:36.000 --> 49:40.000
I feel like this, I know it's gonna be a weird thing to say

49:40.000 --> 49:42.000
because I know Google feels like they have to be competitive.

49:42.000 --> 49:45.000
I know they feel like they want to get in front, out in front of this

49:45.000 --> 49:46.000
because this is where the industry is going.

49:46.000 --> 49:48.000
And I think that is all correct.

49:48.000 --> 49:51.000
I think they are launching this one year too soon.

49:52.000 --> 49:56.000
Because I think if they'd waited to be able to maybe respond a little more

49:56.000 --> 49:58.000
to what now Microsoft is doing on this side

49:58.000 --> 50:01.000
and maybe wait to see if some of the 4K streaming

50:01.000 --> 50:04.000
is only going to get bigger and bigger on Netflix and Amazon Prime.

50:04.000 --> 50:07.000
Maybe that's going to start the conversation about bandwidth caps and so forth.

50:07.000 --> 50:10.000
I just kind of feel like this is almost one year too soon.

50:10.000 --> 50:13.000
But to be fair, I'm going to raise the counterpoint

50:13.000 --> 50:15.000
a lot of you are probably thinking about right now.

50:15.000 --> 50:19.000
Stadia kind of isn't really launching fully this year anyway.

50:20.000 --> 50:22.000
It's only on that Chromecast.

50:22.000 --> 50:24.000
It's a very limited thing.

50:24.000 --> 50:27.000
And to be fair, Stadia doesn't require a powerful PC to run.

50:27.000 --> 50:29.000
It's just streaming.

50:29.000 --> 50:33.000
Whereas the Microsoft stuff is running on your PC hardware.

50:33.000 --> 50:36.000
But they're also going to have their Microsoft cloud service saying that

50:36.000 --> 50:40.000
I don't know how that's going to play into it once that launches.

50:40.000 --> 50:43.000
But for me, I have what I have.

50:43.000 --> 50:47.000
And so I'm not really interested in Stadia in that sense

50:47.000 --> 50:50.000
because I don't need another system to play Destiny 2 on.

50:50.000 --> 50:55.000
I have Destiny 2 on several systems and I don't play it.

50:55.000 --> 50:57.000
Stadia might do really well.

50:57.000 --> 51:00.000
I'm going to be fair because, again, I don't want to shit on what Google's doing

51:00.000 --> 51:04.000
because there are little pieces in here that I really like

51:04.000 --> 51:06.000
and I want to see them succeed.

51:06.000 --> 51:10.000
So I hope at least maybe Google's opening to maybe shifting this around a little bit.

51:10.000 --> 51:12.000
Maybe if they learn some things from this launch and so forth.

51:12.000 --> 51:17.000
But where I do think Google stands to do very well

51:17.000 --> 51:22.000
is in countries that don't always get supported very well

51:22.000 --> 51:25.000
by Sony, Microsoft, Nintendo,

51:25.000 --> 51:28.000
which I know is ironic because Stadia is only launching in 14 countries.

51:28.000 --> 51:34.000
I know it's also ironic because other countries only have so much limited access to Internet.

51:34.000 --> 51:39.000
But I still think there might be enough places in the world where at least the 1080p streaming,

51:39.000 --> 51:42.000
which, let's be real, for most people is going to be good enough.

51:42.000 --> 51:44.000
And some of you are talking about this in chat as well,

51:44.000 --> 51:48.000
is that if you don't have a TV of a certain size, 4K isn't going to do much for you anyway.

51:48.000 --> 51:54.000
So for a lot of people, 1080p is going to be good enough for now.

51:54.000 --> 51:59.000
So there may be a lot of parts of the world where consoles aren't as easy to come by

51:59.000 --> 52:02.000
where maybe Stadia may be a more attractive alternative.

52:02.000 --> 52:07.000
But again, it just depends on, well, if the consoles aren't easy to come by, how's the Internet infrastructure?

52:07.000 --> 52:10.000
It just depends on what country we're talking about.

52:10.000 --> 52:13.000
Anyway, now mistake theory points out.

52:13.000 --> 52:15.000
I don't think it's too little too late.

52:15.000 --> 52:20.000
If it works really well and keeps getting games, all four go a next-gen system.

52:20.000 --> 52:23.000
And I was in the Assassin's Creed test and I loved it.

52:23.000 --> 52:28.000
And I will say, a lot of people that were in that test, I don't hear negative things about it.

52:28.000 --> 52:31.000
A lot of people that were in that saying, yeah, it was responsive, it played very well,

52:31.000 --> 52:34.000
it was a very impressive piece of technology.

52:34.000 --> 52:36.000
So I think we need to all keep that in mind.

52:36.000 --> 52:41.000
I think one thing Google really needs to do when they come out the gate in 2020

52:41.000 --> 52:49.000
is they need to have not just that free, but they need to sprinkle in a few free games just to get you hooked.

52:49.000 --> 52:55.000
And if I'm not mistaken, didn't Destiny 2, didn't they announce the base Destiny 2 package to be free for everybody anyway?

52:55.000 --> 52:56.000
They did.

52:56.000 --> 52:57.000
Okay.

52:57.000 --> 53:00.000
Destiny 2 in the first year of DLC that was for it.

53:00.000 --> 53:02.000
Okay. So there you go.

53:02.000 --> 53:07.000
Why doesn't Stadia just give the Destiny 2 thing for the free level people, that base thing you just mentioned,

53:07.000 --> 53:10.000
for the free level people so that people can get a taste of it, people can sample it.

53:10.000 --> 53:12.000
Because maybe it'll win me over.

53:12.000 --> 53:17.000
If I get my hands on it and I play it on my shitty old laptop and it runs really well, I might be like, oh, this is kind of cool.

53:17.000 --> 53:19.000
Well, and that's the other thing too.

53:19.000 --> 53:23.000
They showed off some games, I want to say, that may have multiplayer in them.

53:23.000 --> 53:26.000
Do I have to buy two of these controllers to do that?

53:26.000 --> 53:27.000
I mean...

53:28.000 --> 53:32.000
Probably, but you could also probably have one person on controller, one person on keyboard and mouse.

53:32.000 --> 53:35.000
It'll work with other controllers, won't it? Didn't they show the other one on?

53:35.000 --> 53:39.000
It does, but the best controller because it connects directly to the Wi-Fi or something.

53:39.000 --> 53:40.000
Right.

53:40.000 --> 53:42.000
Like there's going to be that much latency, I don't know.

53:42.000 --> 53:44.000
Alright, whatever.

53:44.000 --> 53:46.000
Alright, to be continued.

53:46.000 --> 53:50.000
And then we got to Bethesda, which was wrapping up as our show started tonight.

53:50.000 --> 53:56.000
So if Loki seemed a little distracted, he kind of had one ear on the Bethesda thing while that was going on.

53:57.000 --> 53:59.000
Because I don't even know everything they talked about.

53:59.000 --> 54:02.000
They didn't talk about much. In fact, I'm going to just try to see if I can pull up on her.

54:02.000 --> 54:04.000
Well, our expectations were kind of low, right?

54:04.000 --> 54:06.000
It was very low.

54:06.000 --> 54:08.000
No, they weren't going to show any of that.

54:08.000 --> 54:09.000
They said that.

54:09.000 --> 54:13.000
So yeah, basically it was the same type of stuff you would expect that they would show.

54:13.000 --> 54:22.000
So they talked a little bit about Fallout 76 and that there's going to be a brand new set of content coming out for that free.

54:22.000 --> 54:24.000
So they have, for example...

54:24.000 --> 54:25.000
Battle Royale!

54:25.000 --> 54:28.000
Yes, there's this nuclear winter mode called Battle Royale.

54:28.000 --> 54:30.000
It's a 52 player Battle Royale game.

54:30.000 --> 54:32.000
Didn't they also kind of apologize for Fallout 76?

54:32.000 --> 54:37.000
They did. They did apologize that they'd received lots of critique.

54:37.000 --> 54:46.000
There's a brand new free update called Wastelanders that's going to have human NPC characters as well with full dialogue trees.

54:46.000 --> 54:49.000
A new main quest that's coming out this fall.

54:49.000 --> 54:53.000
And then apparently if you want to try Fallout 76, you can do that.

54:53.000 --> 54:58.000
They have a free week or so that's from the 10th through the 17th or 16th?

54:58.000 --> 55:01.000
Yeah, the 17th. So you can try it out then.

55:01.000 --> 55:07.000
Elder Scrolls Blades is coming to Switch and no one gave a shit.

55:07.000 --> 55:13.000
They have the Elder Scrolls Legends, which is going to be the next expansion for that.

55:13.000 --> 55:15.000
It's called Moons of Elsewhere.

55:15.000 --> 55:22.000
They also have Elder Scrolls Online dungeon DLC called Scalebreaker.

55:22.000 --> 55:29.000
They showed off a little bit of Wolfenstein Cyberpilot, which is a VR game coming in July.

55:29.000 --> 55:36.000
A game that I was excited for when they originally were showing this trailer, Commander Keen.

55:36.000 --> 55:38.000
That's pretty cool. Commander Keen's back.

55:38.000 --> 55:41.000
It's pretty cool. It's a 2D side scrolling game.

55:41.000 --> 55:48.000
It is unfortunately a mobile title and it looks like it's just...

55:48.000 --> 55:52.000
I'll hope they had it for it just like right down the tube.

55:52.000 --> 55:54.000
Choices.

55:54.000 --> 55:58.000
Rage 2 is getting an expansion called Rise of the Ghosts.

55:58.000 --> 56:03.000
They also talked about this new software technology for game streaming called Orion.

56:03.000 --> 56:08.000
That's something that I guess is developing and they're implementing at the engine level

56:08.000 --> 56:12.000
that lets game streams with much lower latency.

56:12.000 --> 56:16.000
It's supposed to help stream games at max settings.

56:16.000 --> 56:19.000
This is something they're looking to implement in things like Starfield.

56:19.000 --> 56:25.000
I think maybe stuff that they're looking to implement with Stadia games and stuff like that.

56:25.000 --> 56:27.000
Because they do have stuff coming on there.

56:27.000 --> 56:32.000
Deathloop is another game that's coming out by...

56:32.000 --> 56:35.000
I think it's... was it Arcade Lion?

56:35.000 --> 56:37.000
What is it?

56:37.000 --> 56:42.000
It looks like an action game but it's a time loop type thing.

56:42.000 --> 56:44.000
I'm not really sure what it was based on the trailer.

56:44.000 --> 56:47.000
It just showed two people fighting each other.

56:47.000 --> 56:53.000
And then they had Ghostwire Tokyo which was another game that was teased.

56:53.000 --> 56:55.000
It looked kind of interesting.

56:55.000 --> 57:02.000
And then of course they showed off Doom Eternal and it looks amazing.

57:02.000 --> 57:04.000
Did they date it?

57:04.000 --> 57:07.000
They did. It was November 22nd I think.

57:07.000 --> 57:08.000
It's in November.

57:08.000 --> 57:10.000
Cool.

57:10.000 --> 57:14.000
Yeah, the Doom reboot was so good so I'm happy to hear it.

57:14.000 --> 57:17.000
They also have a multiplayer mode called Battle Mode.

57:17.000 --> 57:18.000
It's two players...

57:18.000 --> 57:19.000
Battle Royale mode?

57:19.000 --> 57:24.000
Two players control a demon versus one player who's Doom guy.

57:24.000 --> 57:27.000
Okay. Oh, interesting.

57:27.000 --> 57:28.000
Yeah, so...

57:28.000 --> 57:31.000
So it's like Pac-Man versus but Doom.

57:31.000 --> 57:33.000
I kind of like that. That's cool.

57:33.000 --> 57:35.000
So yeah, neat.

57:35.000 --> 57:37.000
But yeah, nothing unexpected really.

57:37.000 --> 57:39.000
Nothing surprising.

57:39.000 --> 57:40.000
Just kind of standard fare.

57:40.000 --> 57:41.000
Okay.

57:41.000 --> 57:44.000
Well, I think we knew it was going to be more...

57:44.000 --> 57:47.000
And in general, it's a break.

57:47.000 --> 57:51.000
This is the last year of the current gen before we bring on the next gen.

57:51.000 --> 57:58.000
And I imagine things like Starfield, Elder Scrolls VI are almost assuredly the next gen systems at this point.

57:58.000 --> 57:59.000
Oh yeah.

57:59.000 --> 58:00.000
Very interesting to see.

58:00.000 --> 58:04.000
I think next year's E3 is going to be quite a show I bet.

58:04.000 --> 58:10.000
Anyway, usually we do this a little more towards the top of the show but with all the E3 hype tonight,

58:10.000 --> 58:12.000
we wanted to get all that news out of the way.

58:12.000 --> 58:15.000
A little bit of a different flow for E3.

58:15.000 --> 58:19.000
Next week's show will be the same thing because this time next week we're only part way through E3.

58:19.000 --> 58:23.000
So still to come, we have the PC Gaming Conference.

58:23.000 --> 58:25.000
Your favorite is going to be tomorrow.

58:25.000 --> 58:27.000
Devolver is going on right now.

58:27.000 --> 58:30.000
They're saying it's a Nintendo Direct parody apparently.

58:30.000 --> 58:32.000
I can't wait.

58:32.000 --> 58:33.000
Hoot and a holler.

58:33.000 --> 58:36.000
We'll try to get the bullet points on that before the show is out tonight.

58:36.000 --> 58:39.000
But I'm sure you'll watch the whole thing later if it's that funny.

58:39.000 --> 58:42.000
But we also know Nintendo is a huge deal.

58:42.000 --> 58:43.000
People are waiting for that.

58:43.000 --> 58:44.000
That's Tuesday.

58:44.000 --> 58:45.000
Intellivision.

58:45.000 --> 58:47.000
Amico is apparently showing...

58:47.000 --> 58:51.000
Bobby gave us the tea at the end of his show that they're doing something behind closed doors tomorrow.

58:51.000 --> 58:54.000
We don't know if it's going to be embargoed or not, but we may get some details on that.

58:54.000 --> 58:57.000
Maybe behind closed doors and not get the information out.

58:57.000 --> 58:59.000
Well, it may be embargoed until a certain date.

58:59.000 --> 59:01.000
They may not want it all.

59:01.000 --> 59:02.000
They may be showing people.

59:02.000 --> 59:04.000
They may be trying to get buyers.

59:04.000 --> 59:06.000
You know that from your world that you used to be in.

59:06.000 --> 59:09.000
Maybe they're trying to get the buyers and the shelf space basically.

59:09.000 --> 59:13.000
They want to show people to get the shelf space at Target and things like that.

59:13.000 --> 59:15.000
And maybe the press to some extent.

59:15.000 --> 59:17.000
But maybe they don't want their news being lost in E3 weeks.

59:17.000 --> 59:18.000
They might embargo it until later.

59:18.000 --> 59:19.000
Who knows?

59:19.000 --> 59:20.000
We don't know.

59:20.000 --> 59:21.000
We don't know.

59:21.000 --> 59:22.000
We might see everything tomorrow.

59:22.000 --> 59:23.000
We don't know.

59:23.000 --> 59:24.000
Square Enix is going to be tomorrow.

59:24.000 --> 59:26.000
And actually, here, I'll plug right now.

59:26.000 --> 59:30.000
Here at Twitch.tv slash VOG Network, you can actually check out.

59:30.000 --> 59:33.000
Bobby Blackwolf and I are bringing a special spinoff show tomorrow.

59:33.000 --> 59:36.000
We're going to live react to the Square Enix conference.

59:36.000 --> 59:40.000
The thing we always said we don't understand why people do these.

59:40.000 --> 59:44.000
We've heard from enough people that have said things akin to,

59:44.000 --> 59:49.000
God, I wish I could have seen Rob when they announced Phantasy Star on Line 2.

59:49.000 --> 59:51.000
So, all right.

59:51.000 --> 59:54.000
Square Enix, I know, is not maybe the one you want to see us react to.

59:54.000 --> 59:58.000
But the reality is we hold day jobs, the 9 to 5 type of thing.

59:58.000 --> 01:00:02.000
So, Square Enix is in the right time slot for us to do.

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000
So, we'll do a react tomorrow for Square Enix.

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000
Ubisoft and...

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:07.000
Ubisoft is still coming up.

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.000
And the PC show...

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:10.000
Nintendo.

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:11.000
Nintendo on Tuesday.

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:12.000
Yeah.

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000
So, I feel like I'm missing somebody.

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.000
There's probably more stuff during the week, too.

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:19.000
Like, there's always the Treehouse Live stuff that they always show more things.

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.000
They might give a little bit there, too.

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.000
Is Sony doing any sort of, like, streaming stuff?

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.000
Like, I don't know.

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:28.000
No, we don't think Sony has any type of response.

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000
Or they're relying on third parties to carry them through.

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000
So, we don't know. We don't know.

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000
And Bobby is saying in chat about the Intellivision.

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000
It's not embargoed.

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000
They just don't have a booth.

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000
And they have a meeting room, which is cheaper.

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:44.000
And they're only booking by appointment is basically what it is.

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000
So, very cool.

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:47.000
All right.

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000
Let's get into our gaming weeks.

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000
So, the types of video games that we have been playing this week.

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000
Usually, we would have done this earlier in the show.

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000
But, you know, it's going crazy around here.

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000
Well, I've got unfortunate news.

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000
I haven't played anything this week.

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000
I played a little bit of Pokemon Go.

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000
So, I was just busy.

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000
It was a very stressful week.

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000
Yeah, didn't play anything.

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.000
I played a little bit.

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:12.000
I played, you know, Pokemon Go had Community Day yesterday.

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000
And I was really distracted.

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000
I wasn't able to play a ton

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000
because I was out, you know,

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000
Pride was going on here locally this weekend.

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000
Which, by the way, on a Pride tangent real quick,

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:25.000
happy Pride to everybody that's celebrating.

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:28.000
And also, I should point out a little shout-out

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000
because I've already seen this happen in our chat.

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000
And I do want to say thank you, thank you.

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:35.000
Twitch is running a cute little Pride promotion right now

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.000
where there are special emotes.

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:40.000
And if you cheer at least 200 biddies with one of those emotes,

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000
and it's all there in the biddies thing,

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:46.000
then you actually enable extra emotes for random chatters.

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:49.000
For example, SheHulk10 just did one.

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:50.000
Thank you, thank you.

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:53.000
And I got a little Pride lion out of it in chat.

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:54.000
So, it's kind of cool.

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:57.000
Like, if you do cheers, you're actually giving our chatters

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:58.000
emote icon gifts.

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.000
So, that's really cool.

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.000
So, thank you to everybody that's participating in that.

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:05.000
I'll read off the names of the donators a little later on in the show.

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000
But I do want to say thank you.

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000
Oh, and what's also very important about that

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.000
is that Twitch is actually making,

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.000
I believe a percentage of that,

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000
it's a small percentage, but it is a percentage,

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000
is going to the Trevor Project,

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:20.000
which is a great charity for LGBTQ+.

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.000
So, great. Fantastic.

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000
And thank you, Twitch, for supporting that.

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000
Anyway, okay, so, sorry.

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:29.000
MikeyMeweek was distracted with Pride, Pokemon Go,

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:33.000
but I did catch four shinies of the pink slakoths.

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.000
And for not really playing, that's pretty good.

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.000
So, I'll take it.

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:40.000
And I played a lot of Diablo III.

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:43.000
That's really been my go-to clicky click party game.

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:46.000
I'm up to Paragon 170.

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000
I've played a lot. I've done a lot of rifts.

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:51.000
I've leveled gems up to 25, gotten the extra abilities.

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.000
So, I'm enjoying that, playing my wizard.

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.000
Also been playing a little bit of Heroes of the Storm,

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:59.000
Final Fantasy XIV, because the expansion is only like three weeks away.

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:02.000
And so, there's a lot of hype, or early access is only like three weeks away.

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.000
So, there's a lot of hype going into Shadowbringers

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:05.000
in the next expansion of Final Fantasy XIV.

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.000
So, I'm really excited about that.

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000
And been watching some stuff on Twitch,

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000
but otherwise, as far as playing other stuff,

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:15.000
I haven't really sat down with any other games in depth this week.

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.000
And stream. I was playing a little more and stream.

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.000
And some of the streamable stuff on there.

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:22.000
But too many games I was sampling the list off.

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:28.000
But they're not going to add any more games to and stream during early access.

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:31.000
They've kind of said, you know, early access is just this list,

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:34.000
and then we are going to add.

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:37.000
They said they're going to add games on a regular basis,

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:40.000
but they don't want to say, we're going to add five games every Thursday.

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000
They don't want to beholden themselves to a schedule.

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:45.000
They say, we're going to release games when they're done,

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000
but there will be a fair amount, basically.

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000
But they did add new challenges.

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000
So, they added a few more challenges.

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000
That's kind of nice to see them still doing that.

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000
So, very, very cool.

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000
So, yeah.

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000
That was really it for my gaming week.

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:03.000
So, I think with that, we've got plenty more news to come

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.000
a little later on in the show here.

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.000
So, let's get to the Classic Game of the Week.

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:10.000
Dark Soccer is not here tonight, so you know what that means.

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:11.000
I invited on a guest this week.

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:12.000
So, you ready to get to it?

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:15.000
Yes, let's get to it.

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:18.000
And so, we're going to take a trip down memory lane

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:21.000
to a segment that we call the Classic Game of the Week.

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:24.000
And usually, Dark Soccer or Jamie Summers,

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:27.000
she steps into the gaming vault and finds a game that she thinks,

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:30.000
hey, you guys should be checking out this game this week.

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000
But, as I mentioned earlier in the program,

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000
Dark Soccer is not going to be able to make the show tonight.

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:37.000
So, as we've been doing lately when Jamie's unavailable,

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:40.000
we've been inviting some special guests on the show to help us fill in.

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.000
So, helping us fill in on tonight's program,

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:48.000
please welcome back to the show a podcaster and a regular streamer.

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:51.000
Welcome back, Delvin, Video Game Realness.

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:52.000
Hello.

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:53.000
Hello, everybody.

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:54.000
Hi, welcome back.

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:57.000
It's been a few months since we had you here live.

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:58.000
It's been a moment.

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000
It's been a hot minute.

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.000
So, let's get to it.

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.000
I have a lot I want to talk to you about,

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.000
but specifically, this segment is the Classic Game of the Week.

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000
So, let's get into it.

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:09.000
You know the drill.

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:10.000
We're going to pick a game

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000
and we're going to spotlight that game this week.

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:15.000
So, I said you can pick pretty much any game you want

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:18.000
except this list of 500 games we've already done.

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:23.000
So, what did you pick for the Classic Game of the Week this week?

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:26.000
Well, I went through the list and I had two options

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:29.000
and I was actually surprised that this one that I chose was not on the list.

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:32.000
It's Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles for the NES.

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000
Oh, good pick. Good pick.

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.000
Tiger Claw is screaming somewhere.

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000
He's a big Ninja Turtles fan.

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:39.000
No, this is great.

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:40.000
So, tell us about it.

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:43.000
Well, so I'm a huge Ninja Turtles fan myself.

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:46.000
I was obsessed with Ninja Turtles as a child.

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:51.000
Like, if you could name any type of Ninja Turtles paraphernalia

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000
that existed back then,

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:58.000
whether it be pencils, the figurines, the blimp,

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:02.000
April O'Neil, the communicators, shoes, binders,

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:05.000
everything Ninja Turtles related, I had it.

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:06.000
So...

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.000
Binders full of turtles?

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000
Yes.

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:14.000
So, there was natural extension that when this game was available,

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.000
my parents got it for me.

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.000
Well, actually, technically, no, my parents didn't get it for me.

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:22.000
So, I live in Canada and I have an aunt that lives in the US

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:25.000
and games were significantly cheaper in the US.

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:29.000
So, my aunt had bought, like, eight games for us

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000
and she sent them to us.

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.000
And so, this was one of the games that she bought for us

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.000
because, of course, she knew that I liked Ninja Turtles.

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:41.000
So, this game was released in 1989

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:48.000
and is a side-scrolling platform game with an overhead overworld.

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.000
So, you kind of go over in the overworld

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:53.000
and then there's, like, sewers that you go into for each level.

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:56.000
And, of course, it stars the four Ninja Turtles, Leonardo,

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.000
Raphael, Michelangelo, Donatello,

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:01.000
and they all feature their special weapons

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:04.000
with varying different power and speed.

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:08.000
So, Leonardo is kind of your all-around average guy.

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:11.000
Raphael is quick, but very weak,

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:15.000
but good at eliminating small mobs.

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:18.000
Michelangelo is kind of your, again, all-around,

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:21.000
and Donatello is slow, but his is the most powerful weapon.

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:27.000
So, the storyline of the game is very much what you can expect from a NES game.

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.000
There is very little storyline,

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:34.000
but the storyline follows very much the Ninja Turtles arc

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:38.000
where you're trying to battle Shredder.

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:43.000
He has a weapon that can turn Master Splinter back into a human.

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:44.000
So, they're trying to get that back,

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:48.000
and the game starts out with you having to rescue April O'Neil,

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:51.000
and you go through and rescue April O'Neil,

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:52.000
and then you find out,

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:54.000
oh, you have to go do something else,

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000
and while you're going to do that,

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.000
oh, Master Splinter gets kidnapped,

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.000
and then you have to go save him,

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:02.000
and then you go into the beach Shredder.

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:08.000
So, it is an overworld game,

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.000
and you go through different levels,

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:13.000
just traversing, trying to find where the end level is,

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.000
because it starts out pretty simple

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:19.000
where there's only certain worlds that you can go into,

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:22.000
but once you start to get into the later parts of the game,

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:25.000
there's a whole bunch of levels that are pretty much optional.

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.000
You don't even have to do them.

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:30.000
So, it's kind of an adventure in that sense

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.000
where you have to kind of figure out where it is that you need to go,

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:35.000
but there are little things that you can pick up along the way

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.000
to make the journey a bit easier for you.

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:44.000
So, they do have special weapons that the Ninja Turtles can get.

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:51.000
As on-use weapons, and they come in the quantity of 20 usually.

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000
So, they have the Ninja Stars,

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:56.000
they have triple Ninja Stars, Boomerangs,

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.000
and the almighty Scrolls.

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:01.000
The Scrolls are the best item to get in the game.

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:05.000
It's especially handy for beating bosses.

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:11.000
So, there's some world levels that have those Scrolls,

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:12.000
and generally when you're playing it,

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:15.000
you want to stock up all your Turtles with it

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:20.000
because each of the four can have one of the special weapons.

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000
So, you can kind of mix it up,

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:27.000
but the thing is some levels have them predetermined as to where they are,

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000
and then sometimes you'll go through a level

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:32.000
and then one of these special weapons will just show up,

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:35.000
and if you walk right into the item, you end up losing it.

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.000
So, that was one of the caveats of the game

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:39.000
where you'd stock up on Scrolls

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:42.000
so that you could make the bosses easier when you got to them,

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:45.000
but you had to be very careful as you were going through levels

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:51.000
to make sure not to accidentally pick up basic Boomerangs

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:54.000
because they're not as powerful as the Scrolls.

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:58.000
So, anyway, as you go throughout the game,

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:01.000
this is a very, very hard game,

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:04.000
and I was never able to beat it.

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:08.000
Until back then, what happened was,

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:13.000
so my parents bought me this videotape, VHS tape, that had...

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:14.000
Oh, wow.

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:18.000
Yeah, because Game Facts wasn't a thing.

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:20.000
There was no internets.

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:22.000
There was no internet.

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:29.000
And the strategy guides existed,

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:32.000
but it was really only for the really popular games,

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:37.000
so like your Marios, your Zeldas, Ninja Gaiden, those type of games.

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:41.000
The really popular ones were the ones that were getting strategy guides made

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.000
in Nintendo Power and stuff like that.

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:46.000
And a strategy guide is not going to get you the timing

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.000
on that infuriating damn stage

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:52.000
where you're trying to disarm the bombs and all that stuff.

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.000
The strategy guides aren't going to show you.

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.000
I don't even want to talk about the damn stage, okay?

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.000
No pun intended.

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:01.000
I believe it's showing on the screen right now, but that's all right.

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.000
Yeah, like...

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.000
It's a notorious part of the game.

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:10.000
This level is horrible, because it has seaweed in certain sections,

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:14.000
and the seaweed kind of pulls you in as a current.

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:18.000
So it's hard to swim in certain sections, and there's lightning,

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:21.000
and it's just a very horrible, horrible level.

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:24.000
I still have PTSD over it.

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:29.000
So the tape was a complete playthrough,

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000
pretty much like what you would see on YouTube now,

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.000
but on a VHS tape back then,

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:37.000
and this guy narrated how to get through the game,

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:40.000
what levels you should go into to kind of get the scrolls,

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:43.000
the best ways to beat certain levels,

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.000
because the later on you progress through the game,

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:48.000
once you get into the tectodrome,

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.000
the tectodrome is insane,

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:55.000
and you start to also get limited amounts of pizza,

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:58.000
which is what is used to regenerate your life.

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:02.000
So you start getting less of that as you progress through the game,

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:04.000
and then even if you want to get some,

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:07.000
you have to kind of go to a far part of the stage

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.000
to even get pizza to rejuvenate it.

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:12.000
So the game just becomes increasingly harder that way,

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:15.000
and then you technically don't have any lives.

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:19.000
Your lives are the Ninja Turtles.

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:22.000
So the Ninja Turtles can die,

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:25.000
and then you can go to a certain level and rescue them,

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:26.000
because they get captured.

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:28.000
They don't necessarily die,

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:32.000
but if all four of the turtles get captured, that's it.

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:34.000
You have to basically continue.

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:36.000
I think you get two continues

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:39.000
before you have to start all over again from the beginning.

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:42.000
So it is a very hard game.

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:50.000
So one of the things I was actually looking up for this game

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.000
to talk about this today

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:55.000
was the regional differences of the game.

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:59.000
So the game was released for the Famicom in Japan

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.000
a few months earlier than the American NES version

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:04.000
under the name Geki Kame Ninja Den,

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:08.000
which loosely translates to Legend of the Radical Ninja Turtles.

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:11.000
And this was the first Ninja Turtles product released in the country,

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:16.000
predating the Japanese dub of both the first film and the animated series.

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:19.000
And subsequent Ninja Turtles games released in Japan

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:21.000
kept the franchise original title.

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:24.000
And while graphics and gameplay are virtually identical,

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:28.000
the Japanese localization changed the plot by turning April O'Neil

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:31.000
from an acquaintance of the turtles to Splinter's daughter.

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:36.000
So it's such a random change to make

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:39.000
that they would make April Splinter's daughter,

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:45.000
but especially because the game doesn't really have that much dialogue

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:48.000
that would really be able to convey that.

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:50.000
So it's interesting that they would have changed the dialogue

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:54.000
to actually convey, oh, this is Splinter's daughter.

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:56.000
So I just found that was...

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:58.000
Exploring Splinter turning into a human,

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:00.000
that was something I don't remember ever being addressed.

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:03.000
I mean, it's been a long time, and I don't follow the series as closely

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.000
as some of the rest of you, but I seem to remember

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:08.000
that was kind of an angle unique to the game, right?

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:11.000
Or did they explore that in one of the movies or something?

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:14.000
Yeah, they did in the first or second movie?

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:16.000
Oh, shit. Shows you how much I remember.

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:17.000
I can't recall.

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:21.000
Yeah, because they go into the history of how Splinter and Shredder

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:25.000
know each other and all that stuff.

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:26.000
I will have to...

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:29.000
The movie I saw more than any of them was the third one

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:31.000
when they went back to feudal Japan and all that stuff.

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:32.000
But anyway, I digress.

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:33.000
Oh, that's the worst movie.

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:35.000
I know, right?

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:37.000
You need to watch the first and the second one.

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:40.000
Those are the ones you definitely have to watch.

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:43.000
And then also, so the game was released

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:47.000
as Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles in all the European territories.

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:51.000
So that's another little side tidbit there.

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:56.000
But yeah, this game, it does not like all the other Ninja Turtle games

01:14:56.000 --> 01:15:00.000
that we've come to know for Ninja Turtles games

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:02.000
as the side-scroll and beat-em-up games

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.000
where you can play up to four players.

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:08.000
The one that came after this was Ninja Turtles the arcade game

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:10.000
and was completely different from this.

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:12.000
It wasn't any of the overworld stuff.

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:16.000
It was just your straightforward side-scrolling adventure.

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:19.000
None of this driving in a turtle van all over the city

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:22.000
to find where Master Splinter is in all these different levels.

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:24.000
It was just straightforward.

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:26.000
You went from point A to point B,

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:28.000
but this one was a little bit different.

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:33.000
Kind of almost, I want to say, open world, but not.

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.000
For NES.

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:39.000
Right, for NES, it was what you could probably consider open world

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:42.000
and also one of the other things that it had was

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:45.000
randomly generated levels.

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:48.000
Well, not levels, but I would say the enemies that would show up

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:52.000
whenever you entered the level were not always exact.

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:57.000
So if you left a stage and re-entered, the enemies could change.

01:15:57.000 --> 01:16:01.000
And sometimes the type of enemies that you got would change mid-level.

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:06.000
So there's generally a grouping of enemies that would be paired together

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:08.000
and sometimes they would just randomly change.

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:12.000
Mid-level, and it would never be consistent.

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:19.000
You know what game I'm kind of reminded of with the Konami and Ultra sort of games

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:23.000
where you have the overworld but then you go into these side stages and so forth?

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.000
Metal Gear was kind of like that, in a way.

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:28.000
Absolutely, I was actually going to bring that up.

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:32.000
So this game, yes, was developed by Konami and then, of course,

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:36.000
published under the name Ultra Games

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:41.000
because Nintendo had a whole rule back then where publishers were limited

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:47.000
to how many games they could publish under their brand per year.

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:51.000
So Konami jumped that or beat that by having all these different companies,

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:53.000
Ultra Games being one of them.

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:58.000
And so Metal Gear was also in this type of similar style with the overworld

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:00.000
and then you going into certain levels.

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:03.000
So probably was developed by the same team.

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:08.000
I didn't look that up before doing this,

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:14.000
but it's a good chance that it was developed by a similar team that did this game.

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:19.000
So yeah, Ninja Turtles for the Nintendo Entertainment System.

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:22.000
And what a catchy soundtrack the game had too, for sure.

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:26.000
Oh yeah, I absolutely love the soundtrack in this game.

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:31.000
Even though it's NES and you don't expect amazing soundtracks,

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:36.000
but it was very, very catchy, the music that they did have in the game.

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:40.000
Yeah, despite the fact that the game is notoriously difficult,

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:43.000
I think elements like that, the fact that it was a mixture

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:46.000
of these different genres all at once, a little bit,

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:48.000
and then the great music and all that stuff.

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:53.000
I know that's why I remember the game as opposed to the arcade game,

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:56.000
which is this whole other thing.

01:17:56.000 --> 01:18:03.000
Yeah, there's actually also a Ninja Turtles game,

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:05.000
Fall of the Foot Clan for Game Boy,

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:10.000
that is kind of similar in this style of level,

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:12.000
but didn't have an overworld.

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:16.000
So the levels were kind of similar to how it is in this Ninja Turtles

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:20.000
versus the arcade games, but again, there was no overworld.

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:23.000
So it was just straightforward going through different levels.

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:27.000
And in doing research to try to grab footage for the classic games,

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:29.000
and I never realized this before,

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:33.000
but they had ported this NES game to Commodore 64,

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:37.000
the ZX Spectrum, and there was a DOS version as well

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:39.000
that apparently had a game-breaking bug in it.

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:41.000
It was kind of crazy.

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:44.000
Yeah, I was even unaware of that myself.

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:48.000
But yeah, this game has been around for a while.

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:53.000
It made its hops around the early generation of consoles

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:55.000
that were around back then,

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:58.000
but of course, most people remember it being on the NES.

01:18:58.000 --> 01:18:59.000
Yeah.

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.000
Okay, so we're going to head back to the studio live

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:03.000
because we have a lot of E3 ground to cover still tonight.

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:05.000
But before we do that,

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:09.000
I want to quickly allow you a chance to plug your streaming on Twitch

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:11.000
if people are not already following.

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:12.000
Absolutely.

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:16.000
You can catch me at twitch.tv slash vgrealness

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:20.000
where I occasionally stream whatever games I'm currently playing at the time,

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:25.000
and right now I'm currently replaying Final Fantasy X on the Switch.

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:27.000
And I have to ask you about this before we get back

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:31.000
because something that you and I were co-streaming a little bit.

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:33.000
I know you took a little break from streaming for a couple months,

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:36.000
and honestly, I've been really bad about it too on my personal channel.

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:38.000
But you and I were doing a few streams

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:41.000
where we were playing through Phantasy Star Online

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:43.000
on a private server together.

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:44.000
Correct.

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:47.000
And I have to ask, I'm sure we've talked about this in the studio by now,

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:52.000
but Delvin, Phantasy Star Online 2 for the Xbox,

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:56.000
it's happening in the States and Canada, of course,

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:58.000
and North American regions.

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:00.000
What was your reaction?

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:03.000
I'm not going to lie, I cried.

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:07.000
So when the trailer came on,

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:11.000
I immediately, because Phantasy Star Online

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:14.000
is one of those games where the soundtrack

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:19.000
is so memorable, so identifiable,

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:23.000
I knew exactly what it was before they even finished.

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:25.000
I knew it was Phantasy Star and I was like,

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:27.000
oh my God, is it actually happening?

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:30.000
I was like having a moment and like breaking down,

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:32.000
but I was so happy.

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:34.000
There was definitely a part of me that like,

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:35.000
I think my overwhelming,

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:37.000
and I probably already talked about this in the show,

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:38.000
so I don't want to repeat myself too much,

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:40.000
but I think my overwhelming reaction was fucking finally.

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:42.000
But kind of like with that, there's also that part of me,

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:44.000
it's like, no, I still don't believe it.

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:46.000
I still don't believe that they're doing this.

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:47.000
I know, right?

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:49.000
There's still a little bit of me that it's like,

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:50.000
is this actually happening?

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:52.000
Like, is this a joke?

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:53.000
Yeah, for sure, for sure.

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:55.000
All right, I had to get your opinion on that.

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:58.000
But thank you so much, Delvin, for joining us tonight

01:20:58.000 --> 01:20:59.000
for the classic game of the week.

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:02.000
Have a fantastic week and we'll catch you

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:04.000
on your Twitch channel soon, okay?

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:06.000
Thank you so much and thanks for having me.

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:07.000
You are welcome.

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:09.000
Now let's go back to the studio.

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:11.000
All right, thanks so much to Delvin for joining us

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:13.000
for the classic game of the week.

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:14.000
I appreciate you having him on.

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:16.000
And if you aren't already following VGRealness

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:18.000
here on Twitter, you should do that.

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:21.000
We're back here with episode number 779,

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:22.000
already in progress for tonight.

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:23.000
I don't think I ever said the episode number

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:24.000
at the top of the show.

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:25.000
I was too busy crying.

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:27.000
Or as you start online, too.

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:29.000
So welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio,

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:34.000
episode number 779 for this June the 9th,

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:40.000
or 6-9, nice, of 2019.

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:42.000
And, of course, E3 week already underway.

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:44.000
If you're just joining us, you unfortunately missed

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:47.000
us already recapping the Microsoft event

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:50.000
and the EA Play and Google Stadia,

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:52.000
kind of all the stuff that we've addressed so far.

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:54.000
And, of course, in seven days next Sunday

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:56.000
we'll be back here live to talk about Nintendo

01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:59.000
and Square Enix and television and whatever else

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:02.000
shows up on the floor at E3.

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:04.000
Sadly, not attending the show in person this year.

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:06.000
It's been a little while since we've been able

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:07.000
to attend the show in person.

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:09.000
But, I mean, now the way it is,

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:10.000
I feel like you just kind of get everything

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:13.000
on YouTube anyway, and then Twitch and all that stuff.

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:18.000
So I really feel like we're best kept to having

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:20.000
a forum to talk about those types of things

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:23.000
and discuss the things that are getting us excited.

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:25.000
Because, you know, for, again, what is a year

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:27.000
that's kind of supposed to be all that lull

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:29.000
before the next generation of games,

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:31.000
there's still a lot of stuff to get excited about,

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:34.000
even on Sony's end, you know, for not having gone

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:35.000
to E3 this year.

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:38.000
You know, we did talk about, well, if they showed up

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:40.000
at E3, they'd probably be talking about a lot

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:41.000
of the same stuff they have been.

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:44.000
But that doesn't make The Last of Us 2

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:46.000
or Death Stranding or any of the stuff they have

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:47.000
in the pipeline any less exciting.

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:48.000
Dreams.

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:49.000
I'm still psyched about that game.

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:50.000
Yeah, it should be really good.

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:51.000
Yeah, it should be really good.

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.000
Anyway, we're going to pick up and do some more

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:54.000
rapid-fire news.

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:56.000
And, of course, later on in the show we'll be taking

01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:59.000
your phone calls at our Discord.

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:01.000
If you are not already on our Discord,

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:03.000
you should get there over at vognetwork.com.

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:07.000
That's vognetwork.com slash Discord.

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:08.000
Let's get into some rapid-fire news.

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:11.000
Well, if you're hoping to play Shenmue 3 this year,

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:13.000
you'll still get a chance to do that.

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:14.000
It'll still be later on in the year.

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:17.000
So originally it was supposed to be slated for August 2019.

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:19.000
It's now coming out in November.

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:21.000
November 19th is the new date for it.

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:25.000
And on their Kickstarter page,

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:27.000
Yu Suzuki said,

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:44.000
I'm fine with them taking more time on it.

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:45.000
Take the time to get it right, right?

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:46.000
Exactly.

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:48.000
Now, this is kind of interesting.

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:50.000
I'm unaware of this type of party game coming out,

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:54.000
but apparently they're making a game called Burger Time Party.

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:55.000
That's right.

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:59.000
They're taking the classic Data East arcade classic game

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:02.000
and turning it into a party game.

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:05.000
So apparently you have to build, of course,

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:07.000
the hamburgers much like the original game,

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:10.000
but now it's a little bit more competitive.

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:11.000
Oh, like Mario Party?

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:14.000
Like can you steal the lettuce from other players?

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:15.000
I don't know.

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:16.000
I'm looking at this.

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:17.000
Is it going to be that crazy like Mario Party?

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:18.000
Screenshots.

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:21.000
I mean, it just looks like Burger Time.

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:23.000
It honestly does.

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:24.000
We'll only need to see it in motion.

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:26.000
Maybe we'll get some more information later on.

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:27.000
Yeah.

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:29.000
Are they going to have Impossible Burgers in there as well?

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:30.000
Or like, you know, the...

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:31.000
Perhaps.

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:32.000
Perhaps it very well might be.

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:34.000
Because, you know, we've got to be current and everything.

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:35.000
Yeah.

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:36.000
All right.

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:39.000
Well, let's move on and talk about a game that

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:41.000
I think a lot of you have played at this point,

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:42.000
but it's one of those games where it's like,

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:44.000
hey, it's finally getting a Switch port,

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:47.000
and that game is Dream Daddy.

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:48.000
Loki, I know you're a big fan.

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:49.000
No, I'm just kidding.

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:50.000
I don't think he's ever played it.

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:51.000
I have not played this game.

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:53.000
I actually haven't played it either,

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:56.000
even though I dressed up as one of the characters.

01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:58.000
I did Brian, the one that has a little corgi,

01:24:58.000 --> 01:24:59.000
because he also has like a beard thing.

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:02.000
I dressed up at Dragon Con as him once,

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:04.000
and like maybe three people.

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:05.000
Three people.

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:06.000
Thousands of people go to Dragon Con.

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:08.000
Three people knew what the hell I was doing.

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:09.000
But you know what?

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:10.000
For those three people, shout out.

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:13.000
Anyway, Dream Daddy is coming out for the Nintendo Switch.

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:15.000
It's also coming out for iOS and Android.

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:18.000
So Dream Daddy, all the things.

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:20.000
No official release date yet,

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:22.000
but just confirmation that it's coming.

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:24.000
Happy Pride, I suppose.

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:27.000
And also, not soon, but now,

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:30.000
pretty cool news for Final Fantasy fans.

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:32.000
All the Final Fantasy soundtracks.

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:34.000
Well, I have heard a few are missing,

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:35.000
but for the most part,

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:38.000
a big chunk of those Final Fantasy soundtracks,

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:40.000
I know like all the ones for XIV

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:42.000
and like the Final Fantasy XIV music is great.

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:45.000
Anyway, all those soundtracks on Spotify and Apple Music now.

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:48.000
So if you are, you know, paying for those music services,

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:51.000
you should think about getting on there and stream the music.

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:52.000
Good times.

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:54.000
Alright.

01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:56.000
That's it for rapid fire news.

01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:57.000
Let's travel around the world

01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:59.000
and check out what is coming out in stores this week.

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:01.000
Not a whole lot of stuff coming out over here,

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:05.000
but we've got Battle Worlds Kronos on Nintendo Switch.

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:09.000
We have The House in Fata Morgana,

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:12.000
Dream of the Revalence Edition,

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:14.000
and that's on PlayStation 4.

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:18.000
Doraemon, Nubita's Story of Seasons,

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:20.000
that's on Nintendo Switch.

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:22.000
And last but not least,

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:25.000
Blaster Master Zero on PC.

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:27.000
Oh, that's cool that that's coming to PC.

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:29.000
I remember hearing that that is happening.

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:31.000
So, of course, that was the Switch game.

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:34.000
That's a really cool little, I guess, reinterpretation.

01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:36.000
I don't even know if you'd call it like a remaster

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:37.000
because it's like different,

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:39.000
but like a reinterpretation of the original Blaster Master game.

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:40.000
Yeah.

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:42.000
A little on the easy side compared to the original,

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:45.000
but as I get older and worse at video games, that's okay.

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:48.000
So, I'm there for it.

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:50.000
Let's travel to Japan.

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:52.000
Coming out in Japan this week,

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:55.000
let's see, I think the release day over there is,

01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:57.000
I don't know if we actually have a lot.

01:26:57.000 --> 01:27:00.000
I want to see one game on June 13th for the PlayStation 4.

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:04.000
Yumi Utsutsu Remaster coming out in Japan this week

01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:06.000
on the PlayStation 4,

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:09.000
and checking the Nintendo Switch to see if there's anything there.

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:11.000
Doraemon, Story of Seasons,

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:13.000
that seems to be the big release from Bandai Namco this week,

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:16.000
a new Doraemon game on the Nintendo Switch over in Japan.

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:18.000
Dark Sakura has the night off if you're just joining us.

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:22.000
She had a conflict with the Pride events and some other stuff,

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:24.000
some other personal obligations she had.

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:26.000
So, Loki, do we have the UK dates available?

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:28.000
Yeah, not a whole lot coming out there as well.

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:31.000
We have Kingdom Come Deliverance Royal Edition.

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:34.000
That's on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:38.000
We have Leisure Suit Larry, Wet Dreams Don't Dry

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:40.000
on PlayStation 4 and the Switch.

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:45.000
Warhammer Vermitide 2 Deluxe Edition on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:49.000
World End Syndrome on PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch.

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:50.000
And that's it.

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:52.000
All right.

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:54.000
So, for our next segment, we're going to get into your emails.

01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:56.000
Every week we invite you to send us emails.

01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:58.000
Participate at orangelandtrader.com.

01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:00.000
It's the place where you can send us an email,

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:02.000
and we read our favorite emails here on the show.

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:05.000
We usually read them all unless it's like spam

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:07.000
or something, I don't know, totally weird,

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:08.000
or really long.

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:10.000
We might have to abbreviate them a little bit

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:12.000
if they're really long.

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:14.000
But we are going to get to the mailbag this week.

01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:16.000
We got one email, so I'll read it,

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:18.000
and I think this actually was meant for last week,

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:20.000
but it got in after the cutoff,

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:22.000
because, you know, we actually opened the mailbag

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:24.000
a little bit before showtime.

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:25.000
So, I think this got in a little late,

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:26.000
but I'll read it now.

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:29.000
It's a short one, the email this week from Elliot,

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:31.000
one of our pals who's sent us emails before

01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:34.000
and used to do some stuff at vognetwork.com.

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:36.000
And he has moved on to much bigger and better things.

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:38.000
I'm very happy for him, congratulations.

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:41.000
Not to shade ourselves, which I think I just did,

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:43.000
but no, if I told you what he did now,

01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:45.000
you'd be like, oh, that was bigger and better things.

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:48.000
Anyway, Elliot writes, hey, OLR, writing this fast

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:51.000
so I make it in for the June 2nd show.

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:54.000
After years of flirting with game dev,

01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:57.000
I'm finally getting into it, but it's bloody hard.

01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:59.000
I'm a web developer in my day job,

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:01.000
and this is 10 times harder.

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:04.000
Just makes you appreciate the technical wizardry

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:07.000
of professionally released games even more.

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:08.000
And that's from Elliot.

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:10.000
You know, kind of also a good reminder tonight.

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:13.000
Well, first off, Loki ought to know how hard it is

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:15.000
to make a game, because he's never finished one.

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:17.000
Yes, that's true.

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:20.000
But, I mean, it also kind of goes to show,

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:22.000
if somebody's like thinking about making a game,

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:24.000
what are some good resources for them to start?

01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:26.000
Like, there's a lot of good YouTube tutorials out there.

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:27.000
The internet.

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:29.000
The internet, yeah, it's a wide, wonderful internet.

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:32.000
A lot of these modern development platforms

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:34.000
really good, have a lot of tutorials.

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:35.000
Yeah, I mean, any of them.

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:37.000
Like, if you pick Unity or Unreal,

01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:39.000
they've got a lot of different tutorials out there

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:40.000
on how to do stuff.

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:41.000
Yeah.

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:43.000
I know Unity has a ton of stuff.

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:45.000
I've gone through a little bit of the Unreal stuff.

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:48.000
The Unreal tutorials, like the official ones that they have,

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:50.000
not all that helpful.

01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:53.000
They're kind of, it's weird how they have them set up,

01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:55.000
but there's a lot of like independent stuff out there

01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:56.000
that you can find.

01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:58.000
There's tutorials and everything out there,

01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:01.000
so you just pick your subject and you can find something.

01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:04.000
Bobby Blackwolf in our chat at twitch.tv slash vog network says,

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:07.000
what resources should they go to so they can finish a game?

01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:10.000
There's a lot about starting, but not about finishing.

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:11.000
That is a problem.

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:14.000
If Loki knew, maybe we wouldn't make fun of him so much.

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:17.000
But, no, that's true.

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:18.000
Finishing is a...

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:19.000
Well, finishing a game,

01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:22.000
first thing that you want to do is make sure you don't have a family,

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:24.000
and you're not going to have a family.

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:26.000
What you want to do is make sure you don't have a family,

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:29.000
and that you're not working a full-time job.

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:30.000
Stop.

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:31.000
No, I honestly...

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:33.000
Well, here's the piece of advice I've always heard

01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:35.000
that you have flat-out rejected,

01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:38.000
and that is to start with a game that you already know.

01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:41.000
Make Pong, and then put your spin on it.

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:43.000
Make, I don't know, make...

01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:44.000
What are other like...

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:46.000
Breakout, make Breakout, put your spin on it.

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:47.000
Make Kaboom.

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:50.000
Pick an Atari 2600 game, remake it, put your spin on it.

01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:51.000
Type it in.

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:53.000
You don't even have to necessarily do that,

01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:58.000
but it's like even just following along with some of these tutorials and stuff,

01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:01.000
it'll help you with coding,

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:04.000
because a lot of them, especially some of the ones I do,

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:05.000
they kind of give you like,

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:07.000
okay, here, we're doing a bunch of stuff.

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:09.000
Okay, now we're going to have you pause the video,

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:12.000
and you figure out how to do this.

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:14.000
And then when you're done, unpause it,

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:16.000
and then if you can't figure it out, you just watch it,

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:19.000
and it'll kind of help you try to figure out what to do

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:20.000
based on what you've learned already.

01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:23.000
And doing some of those will help you kind of get back into the swing of things.

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:26.000
Like, I hadn't been coding in Unity for a long time,

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:29.000
so I went through one of those tutorials just to build a game.

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:33.000
Yes, there is a finished game I have.

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:36.000
No, it's not mine, because it's a Unity tutorial, so that doesn't count.

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:41.000
But it got me back into kind of like,

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:44.000
oh, okay, here's how all the syntax works again,

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:46.000
and I kind of forgot how this was,

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:48.000
and here's how I do these things.

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:50.000
And then, of course, as you're going along,

01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:52.000
especially when you're starting out,

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:54.000
you're just going to not know how to do something,

01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:55.000
or can't figure something out.

01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:58.000
You just search it, Google, stack social.

01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:01.000
And if you even want to take it a little bit easier

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:05.000
to just be able to create something, to kind of have an outlet,

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:08.000
like, you know, your oldest kid, eight years old, right,

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:10.000
is doing coding or learning how to do games.

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:12.000
Scratch, yeah. You can do Scratch. That's free.

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:15.000
So there's also very elementary platforms.

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:18.000
Or ZZT, my always favorite.

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:22.000
But no, seriously, making a little big planet level

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:26.000
and making a good one will be a lot about how to make a game.

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:28.000
It's not everything, but it's a lot of, you know,

01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:31.000
if you have the patience to finish a really good little big planet level,

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:33.000
it's a start.

01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:35.000
And there's a lot of stuff out there that is free.

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:38.000
Unity is free. Unreal Engine is free.

01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:42.000
I'm not sure, but I think that there's even a

01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:45.000
game maker version that's free.

01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:47.000
There's a lot of free versions of things out there.

01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:50.000
You can try it out and see if that's going to be a good fit for you.

01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:53.000
And if that engine doesn't work for you, then try something else.

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:58.000
Yeah, and some of those, like, Steam, you know, sold game creation platforms,

01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:01.000
like, there are really games that have been made on those, right?

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:02.000
Like Five Nights at Freddy's was what?

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:04.000
Click Studio? Was that a...

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:05.000
I don't know.

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:07.000
Sorry, guys, I don't remember which did which.

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:10.000
But I know, like, Five Nights at Freddy's was made for one of those type of engines.

01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:13.000
So, and obviously that game has done very well for itself.

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:15.000
Yeah, I mean, there's lots of things out there.

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:18.000
Click Team Fusion. I knew Bobby would correct me.

01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:20.000
Love having a live chat.

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:23.000
But yeah, I mean, and a lot of times, like, Humble Bundle will do, like,

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:26.000
a thing of, you know, game maker packs and stuff like that,

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:28.000
where you can get Game Maker Studio for, like, dirt cheap.

01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:30.000
Which Bobby points out Undertale was a game maker game.

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:31.000
Yeah.

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:35.000
And then AkumaJP, also giving advice.

01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:38.000
I know he's had his fair share of how to make games.

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:41.000
AkumaJP says, just get a free project and play with it.

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:42.000
That's the fastest.

01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:45.000
Yes, they always come with a free project.

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:47.000
Just play with that. You'll learn a lot in no time.

01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:49.000
So that's a good suggestion as well.

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:51.000
So lots of great suggestions about how to do it.

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:54.000
Which I know is, like, totally not what Elliot was, like, really asking.

01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:57.000
But I think also just kind of encouraging people to see what kind of goes into it.

01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:59.000
I think it also...

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:01.000
I always...

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:04.000
You know, when people are super critical about games, right?

01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:06.000
Like, this game looks like garbage.

01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:13.000
Which is so easy to say in a tweet or on a forum post or in the comments section of YouTube.

01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:16.000
Being able to say a game is garbage is so easy to do.

01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:21.000
But, like, if you really know, like, what goes into making a game,

01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:25.000
I think you start to go away from that perspective of garbage game

01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:29.000
and more the perspective of, hmm, doesn't look like my cup of tea,

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:31.000
but it's neat that they did this.

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:33.000
Or at least, oh, somebody put together this game, looks cool.

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:37.000
You know, maybe this is some constructive feedback I have on how to make it better.

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:39.000
I think it really does kind of change your perspective a little bit.

01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:43.000
Because unfortunately, if you grew up watching, you know, G4TV or TechTV,

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:45.000
you probably remember that commercial about,

01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:48.000
here, you should go to school and learn how to make games.

01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:51.000
And that dude's sitting there going, let's turn up the graphics on level three.

01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:55.000
He turns up and he's like, that is not fucking real at all.

01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:57.000
You all know that. Just to make sure you all know that.

01:34:57.000 --> 01:34:59.000
That's not fucking real.

01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:00.000
The commercial's not fucking real.

01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:03.000
But they have a lot of, like, even community colleges and stuff.

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:06.000
A lot of them have game-making tracks and stuff like that that you can do.

01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:10.000
Don't do any of the online colleges, or not the online colleges,

01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:14.000
but the game institute I wouldn't necessarily recommend.

01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:17.000
I've actually done that before just to see what that was like.

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:20.000
And no, their stuff's pretty dated.

01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:22.000
Plus, you can find a lot of it separately.

01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:25.000
Udemy has a lot of decent ones you can find,

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:28.000
especially when they go dirt cheap and everything.

01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:31.000
But a lot of that stuff's even on YouTube.

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:33.000
YouTube has tons of tutorials out there.

01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:37.000
Unity, Unreal, they all do official tutorials for their stuff.

01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:39.000
Unity's pretty good about doing that,

01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:44.000
and they do them every year during their conferences that they do.

01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:47.000
And they always go over the new features that they have,

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:49.000
so that's always good to stay on top of all that stuff.

01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:50.000
Because sometimes it's hard to figure out,

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:52.000
especially when you haven't worked in it in a while,

01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:55.000
they've changed so much that how you used to do something

01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:57.000
isn't the way you do it anymore.

01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:00.000
Just a lot of different...

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:01.000
You may want to learn,

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:05.000
how do I make this type of thing happen?

01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:07.000
Like a driving game or something like that.

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:09.000
It can get kind of complicated if you want to mimic

01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:11.000
some of the things that are out there.

01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:14.000
But yeah, just experiment.

01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:17.000
Don't try to overscope.

01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:20.000
It's hard to say not to do that, but you know.

01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:22.000
Take your own advice. I'm just kidding.

01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:23.000
I try.

01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:25.000
Props to those that are trying to get into it.

01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:26.000
So thank you so much for the email.

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:28.000
Please send us more emails.

01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:30.000
Participate at orangelauntradio.com.

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:33.000
Before we get to our next story, we have breaking news.

01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:35.000
And this is where I need a button for the breaking news,

01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:37.000
like the graphic.

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:39.000
So that's something for me to work on during E3.

01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:40.000
Breaking news.

01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:41.000
Apparently there has been a leak.

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:43.000
This one's pretty major.

01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:46.000
GameSpot accidentally posted an article early.

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:48.000
Must have dated the day wrong.

01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:50.000
You know, one of those automated pusher things.

01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:52.000
Whoopsie doopsie.

01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:54.000
Apparently the article says,

01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:57.000
Final Fantasy VII Remake releasing this winter.

01:36:57.000 --> 01:37:02.000
So it is a Quarter 4 2019 or Quarter 1 2020.

01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:05.000
Remember, winter doesn't necessarily mean before Christmas.

01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:07.000
It just means it could be a January, February game.

01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:09.000
Final Fantasy VII Remake releasing this winter.

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:13.000
Apparently the little headline on the article said,

01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:15.000
Winter is coming.

01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:17.000
So you know what that means, right?

01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:19.000
And apparently the article also confirmed

01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:22.000
it is a PlayStation 4 exclusive.

01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:24.000
And apparently there is a release date reveal

01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:26.000
to happen at the concert.

01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:28.000
I guess this concert that they were doing,

01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:31.000
it was supposed to be the time of the big reveal for that.

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:32.000
So there it is.

01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:34.000
That is just breaking.

01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:37.000
Apparently an article went up and then it was pulled.

01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:39.000
But of course once on the internet,

01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:41.000
somebody copy pasted it and put it on a reset era

01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:43.000
and then it's all over Twitter at this point.

01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:45.000
So there you go.

01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:46.000
There it is.

01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:47.000
Winter is spoiled.

01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:48.000
Bobby Blackwell says,

01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:50.000
So I guess our co-stream is canceled, Rob.

01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:52.000
No, because they're still going to show off footage and so forth.

01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:54.000
And we can act surprised at the news.

01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:56.000
We can go, what?

01:37:56.000 --> 01:38:00.000
I mean, is it surprising that Final Fantasy VII Remake is this winter?

01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:02.000
No.

01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:04.000
I don't think so either.

01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:08.000
It's dangerous if they don't, if they go out much further

01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:12.000
because hello, next year's conversation is going to be about PlayStation 5

01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:14.000
and the next Xbox.

01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:17.000
So I think the longer they wait to do it,

01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:19.000
they're going to be in a little more danger.

01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:21.000
Take the time to get it right.

01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:23.000
I mean, don't get me wrong,

01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:28.000
but the unfortunate part of that is if they wait too long,

01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:30.000
then they're going to push it back to the next console,

01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:33.000
which I think will be a whole other thing going on there.

01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:34.000
So anyway.

01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:37.000
From what I hear, though, the concert sucked.

01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:39.000
Oh, that's too bad.

01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:41.000
You know what, though?

01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:45.000
I went to, so Jason and I, Jason, our voiceover guy,

01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:48.000
and I went to Dear Friends, the first E3 I ever went to.

01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:51.000
And it was like the first Final Fantasy concert in the States.

01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:54.000
That was, what, 2004, I think it was, in L.A., was the first E3.

01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:56.000
That concert was great.

01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:59.000
The next year, we went to More Friends,

01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:02.000
which was at a different venue, which, to put it in perspective,

01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:06.000
that venue has since been bulldozed and turned into Harry Potter World.

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:09.000
Fact, that is true statement.

01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:11.000
Gibson, Gibson, whatever.

01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:13.000
They turned into Harry Potter World.

01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:15.000
That was the More Friends concert.

01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:17.000
That More Friends concert, not good.

01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:18.000
Well, this one, they said, it says,

01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:20.000
we're at the final, this is a tweet there,

01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:22.000
we're at the Final Fantasy VII concert, it's a legit scam,

01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:25.000
two-thirds of it has been them playing the MIDI from the game.

01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:28.000
They didn't say anywhere in the advertising that the orchestra

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:31.000
would be sitting in pure silence, wasting everyone's time,

01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:34.000
as they're literally playing fucking MIDI.

01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:36.000
Oh, dear.

01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:38.000
Oh, dear.

01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:41.000
I hope, oh, gosh, that does not sound good.

01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:43.000
I'll be curious for more information on that.

01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:44.000
But anyway, we're gonna move on.

01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:47.000
We do have some more news that's outside of just the press conferences

01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:48.000
we've been talking about so far.

01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:51.000
There's more news showing up this week, so, Loki.

01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:54.000
So they've got a new Yooka-Laylee trailer that's out now

01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:58.000
for a brand new game, Yooka-Laylee and the Impossible Lair,

01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:00.000
and it looks pretty cool.

01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:03.000
It's kind of the same style as Donkey Kong Country.

01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:10.000
It's a pure side-scroller as opposed to a kind of 3D platform game.

01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:13.000
Awesome, because I think Donkey Kong Country is awesome,

01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:15.000
and I would love to see that sort of thing make a comeback.

01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:20.000
Yes, I know Tropical Freeze was a thing, but I'd be curious.

01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:24.000
It looks cool. I mean, I'd be willing to check this out, so neat.

01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:26.000
Yeah, very cool.

01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:28.000
Are they doing a Kickstarter for it, or is it just happening?

01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:29.000
I think it's just happening.

01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:31.000
That's cool.

01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:36.000
All right, well, moving on to some sources and things

01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:38.000
that are coming out of Blizzard.

01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:42.000
Blizzard has apparently cancelled a StarCraft first-person shooter.

01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:45.000
This first-person shooter was in development over the last two years.

01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:50.000
It has apparently been confirmed by Kotaku with three people

01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:53.000
in the studio familiar with what's going on.

01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:57.000
The reason for this, Blizzard is taking those resources

01:40:57.000 --> 01:41:00.000
and putting them into Diablo and Overwatch.

01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:05.000
So the inevitable Diablo 4, which we know will be a thing eventually,

01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:09.000
not on mobile phones, and some sort of Overwatch 2,

01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:12.000
of which I know there's a lot of rumors that Overwatch 2

01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:18.000
is going to take a PvE element to it as well as the PvP,

01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:20.000
although obviously this is not a story about Overwatch 2,

01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:24.000
but we have heard a little bit of the rumble, rumble, rumble for that.

01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:27.000
The new StarCraft game was codenamed Ares.

01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:31.000
It was supposed to be a battlefield game in the StarCraft universe.

01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:35.000
It sounds like the Overwatch engine may have been leveraged

01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:38.000
in making this game, which is a pretty smart idea, right?

01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:40.000
Why not take this first-person shooter over here?

01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:42.000
Why not take the engine to make this own thing?

01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:45.000
So battlefield in the StarCraft universe, that would have been kind of rad, probably.

01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:47.000
But unfortunately, I guess it didn't happen.

01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:51.000
Apparently, folks were shocked within Blizzard that this game got canceled

01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:53.000
because apparently it was looking pretty good.

01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:55.000
Here's the interesting thing.

01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:58.000
Kotaku reached out to Blizzard for comment.

01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:02.000
99% of the time when you contact these companies for comment, what do you get?

01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:04.000
We don't comment on rumors and speculation, right?

01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:06.000
That's not what Kotaku got back.

01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:09.000
Blizzard said, we don't generally comment on unannounced projects,

01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:11.000
but we will say the following.

01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:14.000
We always have people on different ideas behind the scenes,

01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:17.000
including multiple projects right now, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:20.000
We pour our heart and souls into this work, and as players ourselves,

01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:24.000
we know how exciting it can be to see and know with certainty

01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:26.000
that a new project is coming.

01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:28.000
Knowing that changes or disappointments can happen

01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:31.000
doesn't make it any less painful when we have to shelve a project

01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:33.000
or when an announcement doesn't go as planned.

01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:35.000
Why are they saying this if it ain't true?

01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:38.000
Yeah, it's a little bit more than we don't comment on rumors.

01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:39.000
Yeah, a little more than that, right?

01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:40.000
Et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:43.000
With all that said, we're very much looking forward to revealing other things

01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:46.000
we're working on when the time is right,

01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:49.000
which brings me to why this cancellation is your fault.

01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:52.000
Not you specifically, but gamers.

01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:53.000
So here's the thing.

01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:57.000
Now, granted, the game may have actually been messy on the inside.

01:42:57.000 --> 01:42:58.000
I don't know.

01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:01.000
But I think the important thing about this is that those resources

01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:04.000
were shifted to Diablo and Overwatch,

01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:08.000
and that is because after that negative reception

01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:10.000
that they got from the last BlizzCon,

01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:13.000
which is in big part Blizzard's own fault

01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:15.000
and Activision's fault, I'm sure, as well,

01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:20.000
but I think after the internet collectively dragged them through the mud

01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:23.000
for not having a new Diablo game and so on,

01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:26.000
it is imperative at Blizzard,

01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:28.000
and this is how they got to fix that BlizzCon.

01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:29.000
It is imperative.

01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:31.000
It is priority number one at Blizzard right now,

01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:36.000
I'm speculating, that Diablo 4 fucking happens at this BlizzCon,

01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:39.000
and it came at this cost,

01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:42.000
because they needed the resources in order to have Diablo 4

01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:45.000
something that you can see at this year's BlizzCon,

01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:48.000
and so that's why StarCraft getting cancelled, I believe,

01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:50.000
is in part the internet's fault.

01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:52.000
Now, granted, one could argue, well,

01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:54.000
Blizzard should have never brought a half-assed thing to BlizzCon in the first place,

01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:58.000
but did you have to drag them that bad?

01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:02.000
Did you have to get up on stage and actually ask to the guy's face,

01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:04.000
which was a little bit disrespectful,

01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:07.000
is this an April Fool's joke that's out of season?

01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:09.000
What do you think?

01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:11.000
So.

01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:15.000
Well, to be, well, to play devil's advocate,

01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:19.000
I'm sure that they felt a little bit entitled,

01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:23.000
because they paid money to be at that event,

01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:27.000
is why they felt entitled to see something that they wanted to see

01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:30.000
versus, like, this is what we have to show you,

01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:32.000
too bad that you don't like it.

01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:35.000
Some folks in chat making the joke,

01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:37.000
I think I must admit I've seen before,

01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:40.000
StarCraft Ghost cancelled for a second time, in a way.

01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:43.000
Wouldn't that have been ironic if this game had been StarCraft Ghost,

01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:45.000
because it didn't have a name?

01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:47.000
How about that? Can you imagine if,

01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:49.000
let's fan-wank for a minute,

01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:51.000
because we already know this isn't going to happen,

01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:53.000
but if they had done this BlizzCon, they do this unveil,

01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:56.000
and the title comes up, it's StarCraft Ghost.

01:44:56.000 --> 01:44:57.000
And people would have been like,

01:44:57.000 --> 01:44:58.000
What?

01:44:58.000 --> 01:44:59.000
That's exactly,

01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:00.000
What?

01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:05.000
They would have lost their mind that StarCraft Ghost was resurrected.

01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:06.000
Right?

01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:07.000
I don't know.

01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:09.000
I think people would have went crazy.

01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:11.000
And Slidekick is in our chat and wants to know,

01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:14.000
OMG Rob, are you drinking from a Gwen Stefani cup?

01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:15.000
Yes, I am.

01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:18.000
I got this when we saw the Vegas residency show.

01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:21.000
I'm surprised you can see that on Twitch,

01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:22.000
probably because we're zoomed in tonight.

01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:24.000
We're zoomed in a little bit on the Twitch picture,

01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:26.000
because Jamie's not here, so we don't have to be over the shoulder,

01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:29.000
so we have a little tighter shot on Loki and I,

01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:31.000
so I guess you can even see what's written on the cup,

01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:32.000
so there you go.

01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:33.000
Yes, you can.

01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:34.000
You can look right there.

01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:35.000
Oh yes, I can also just look at the TV,

01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:36.000
but I'm trying not to do that,

01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:38.000
because when I look over here, it looks weird,

01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:39.000
so I'm trying to look at you.

01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:40.000
All right, anyway.

01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:43.000
Mistake Theory in chat says,

01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:44.000
Well, maybe I'm just uninitiated,

01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:46.000
but I don't know what StarCraft Ghost is.

01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:49.000
Hey, good call, because that was a long time ago, right?

01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:52.000
So StarCraft Ghost was a StarCraft spin-off game

01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:54.000
that they were making, and it was like a shooty game.

01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:56.000
It was behind, you know, because StarCraft isn't like that.

01:45:56.000 --> 01:45:59.000
StarCraft is like Warcraft in space, right?

01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:00.000
It's a tactical game,

01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:02.000
but they were going to do another game in that universe

01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:04.000
that was like over the shoulder, right?

01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:05.000
It was Nova, right?

01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:06.000
It was starring her, I think,

01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:07.000
and it was like a shooty game,

01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:11.000
and it was being developed for Nintendo 64, PlayStation 1?

01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:12.000
It was old.

01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:13.000
PlayStation 2, I guess.

01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:14.000
It was old.

01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:15.000
It was being made for, you know,

01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:18.000
maybe it was PlayStation 2 in that era of games,

01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:20.000
because it would have been like the mid-late 90s,

01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:23.000
because Bobby saw it a long time ago in Atlanta.

01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:25.000
So it would have been like, what, 98 or something like that.

01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:27.000
So it was around that time.

01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:29.000
So, yeah, it was a while ago.

01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:30.000
Yeah, Quest Buster confirms there.

01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:32.000
Yeah, in the late 90s.

01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:34.000
Yeah, so, all right.

01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:35.000
So there you go.

01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:37.000
Unfortunate to hear about that cancellation at Blizzard,

01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:38.000
but who knows?

01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:40.000
Maybe the game will come back,

01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:42.000
and Diablo 4, I guess,

01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:44.000
is almost certain to be a BlizzCon announcement this year.

01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:46.000
Maybe Overwatch 2 as well,

01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:49.000
but don't get your hopes up.

01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:53.000
Don't do it, because it's a dangerous thing to do.

01:46:53.000 --> 01:46:55.000
Loki, what do you have for us?

01:46:55.000 --> 01:47:00.000
So there's this Apple event that was going on.

01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:04.000
So they had talked a little bit about TVOS,

01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:09.000
and, of course, the new things that are going to be coming to that,

01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:12.000
which I think was one of those is the,

01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:14.000
was it they called the Apple Arcade or whatever that was?

01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:15.000
Yeah.

01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:16.000
So part of that, though,

01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:19.000
they were saying that there was going to be support with TVOS

01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:21.000
for third-party controllers.

01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:25.000
So Xbox One and PlayStation 4 controllers have support,

01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:28.000
so you can actually use those to play games on TVOS

01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:31.000
and the games that are on there.

01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:32.000
So, neat.

01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:34.000
I mean, that makes sense.

01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:36.000
Yeah, and assuming, you know,

01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:37.000
they're just assuming, I guess,

01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:39.000
that a lot of homes have those controllers already.

01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:40.000
Probably.

01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:41.000
So maybe, unlike Google Stadia,

01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:42.000
they're like,

01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:43.000
well, we don't really need to sell a separate one.

01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:44.000
Well, and to be fair,

01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:45.000
in Google Stadia's case,

01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:47.000
it also supports those controllers, too.

01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:49.000
It's just that they have an extra one that they're going to sell, too,

01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:52.000
that ties into the network and all that stuff, whatever.

01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:55.000
But Apple maybe doesn't see a need to reinvent the wheel.

01:47:55.000 --> 01:47:57.000
They figure, oh, people have these devices in their home already.

01:47:57.000 --> 01:47:59.000
Let's just make, you know, it's all Bluetooth anyway.

01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:02.000
Let's just make our device work with it, which seems pretty smart,

01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:05.000
especially if Apple Arcade is going to have, you know,

01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:07.000
more games that require a controller.

01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:10.000
So what I'm really curious to see is when we start seeing these games

01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:12.000
that are on Apple Arcade,

01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:15.000
maybe they're not going to be necessarily just touchscreen games.

01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:17.000
Yeah, I would hope so.

01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:24.000
Otherwise, it doesn't really seem like a very promising platform.

01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:25.000
Yeah.

01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:28.000
So very curious to see more on that

01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:32.000
and how that develops and what type of games are on Apple Arcade in the future.

01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:35.000
Moving on, I'm surprised I didn't give this story to you.

01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:37.000
I guess I ran out of spots.

01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:38.000
I know you're the Borderlands fan,

01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:41.000
but feel free to comment on this further if you'd like.

01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:44.000
But it was announced that Borderlands 2 is officially,

01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:46.000
because I think it was leaked early on, but they confirmed it.

01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:49.000
Yeah, it leaked out onto the Steam store.

01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:52.000
That Borderlands 2 would get new DLC,

01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:55.000
and it's in anticipation of Borderlands 3's release.

01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:59.000
The Borderlands 2 DLC is Commander Lilith and the fight for Sanctuary.

01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:01.000
And yeah, leaked out to Steam,

01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:04.000
but then it was confirmed during the Microsoft event today

01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:09.000
that, yeah, this DLC is upping the game's level cap to 80,

01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:12.000
and you can just start a new character at level 30 if you want

01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:13.000
to just jump right into it.

01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:15.000
So that's pretty cool.

01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:16.000
So yeah.

01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:17.000
Out the plate.

01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:18.000
Yeah.

01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:21.000
Now, they're saying that this...

01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:22.000
Did it just come out today?

01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:23.000
I think so, yeah.

01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:24.000
No, that's good, because I was going to say,

01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:26.000
if it doesn't release soon,

01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:29.000
then there's not going to be a lot of time to enjoy it before Borderlands 3 comes out.

01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:33.000
Yeah, because today was also when they put it on Games Pass as well.

01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:34.000
So it's available.

01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:38.000
Games Pass also has the DLC and everything's available,

01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:40.000
and then this is available as well for free.

01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:41.000
So you get that.

01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:42.000
Yeah.

01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:43.000
Pretty cool.

01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:47.000
So I'm still on Borderlands 1,

01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:49.000
making my way slowly to Borderlands 2,

01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:51.000
so I probably won't get to this anytime soon,

01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:53.000
but is this something you might check out?

01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:54.000
Yeah, I might.

01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:57.000
I probably should start Borderlands 2.

01:49:57.000 --> 01:49:58.000
That's going to be the case.

01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:00.000
Metal Mayhem points out the DLC's free too.

01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:01.000
Yeah.

01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:03.000
Which, if it's a big advertisement for the third game,

01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:07.000
in a way, then it makes sense that you might put that out there for free

01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:11.000
to try to make sure you get those $60 pre-orders from Borderlands 3, right?

01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:12.000
Yeah.

01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:15.000
And maybe some limited edition sales and so forth as well.

01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:17.000
Loki, you got one more story for us, right?

01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:21.000
Yeah, so this is a little bit of a preview of what we might see tomorrow with Ubisoft,

01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:26.000
but apparently there is a leak that a game called Watchdog Legion

01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:29.000
is going to be announced tomorrow,

01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:33.000
and it's supposed to be the brand new Watchdogs game

01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:35.000
where it's going to allow you to play as anyone,

01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:38.000
every individual you meet in the open world,

01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:41.000
has a full set of animations, voiceover, character traits,

01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:46.000
and visuals that are generated and guided by gameplay systems.

01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:52.000
So that's how they're describing it according to the Amazon UK listing for this.

01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:54.000
So neat that that would be a thing.

01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:56.000
I don't know how exactly that plays into it.

01:50:56.000 --> 01:50:59.000
The new game is supposed to take place in London,

01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:01.000
so I guess we'll find out tomorrow,

01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:04.000
which I'm sure this will be a big part of the announcement,

01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:09.000
or they're going to have, I would imagine, a big portion of the Ubisoft event dedicated to this.

01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:15.000
Of course, not before they have a really awkward fucking dance number for Just Dance,

01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:19.000
because they do that every fucking year, and it's goddamn annoying.

01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:22.000
And I'm sure this year will be no different.

01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:25.000
Yeah, I'm going to just, well, I have to work tomorrow anyway,

01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:28.000
and I'm not going to try to watch these things while I'm at work.

01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:31.000
I'll look at the bullet points, though, which you missed a little later on.

01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:33.000
There's some good YouTube trailers to see. I'll look at those.

01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:36.000
But the Square Enix one is probably the only one I'm going to watch live,

01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:40.000
because I wonder if they'll announce a release date for Final Fantasy VII Remake.

01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:41.000
I wonder.

01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:42.000
Maybe.

01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:44.000
That would make a lot of sense.

01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:46.000
They got Sony's slot.

01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:49.000
I wonder if they might be announcing anything from PlayStation 4 tomorrow

01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:51.000
that might be a big deal for this year.

01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:54.000
Or early next year, maybe.

01:51:54.000 --> 01:51:57.000
All right, anyway, we're about to get to our Discord calls,

01:51:57.000 --> 01:52:01.000
so if you want to join our Discord over at voggenetwork.com slash Discord,

01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:03.000
that'll get you an invite to the server.

01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:05.000
We'll be taking those calls in just a little bit

01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:07.000
if you want to join our Green Room channel

01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:09.000
and tell us what you want to call in about tonight

01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:11.000
in our channel, Orange Lounge Radio.

01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:16.000
But first, I'm sure you guys have seen this story floating around the Internet.

01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:20.000
There is going to be Xbox Body Wash coming out. That's right.

01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:23.000
Are they going to hand that out at E3?

01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:24.000
Let's hope.

01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:28.000
Some personal hygiene products called Xbox Links,

01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:30.000
which is funny because Atari had a system called the Links,

01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:32.000
and it's spelled L-Y-N-X. Yeah, right.

01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:35.000
So, the Xbox Links.

01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:39.000
Links is what they call Axe in Australia.

01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:41.000
So, like Axe Body Spray.

01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:43.000
That's what they call it in Australia.

01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:47.000
So, assumably, if this product is coming stateside as well,

01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:50.000
it's going to be Microsoft Axe as well.

01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:53.000
However, a representative did say,

01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:56.000
there are no plans to offer this in the U.S. at this time.

01:52:56.000 --> 01:52:58.000
However, we would certainly love to.

01:52:58.000 --> 01:53:02.000
So, this may only be a thing that's going to be Australia, New Zealand, China,

01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:04.000
or something like that.

01:53:04.000 --> 01:53:07.000
It is a nice, bright green color,

01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:10.000
because if you've ever seen Axe Body Wash sitting on the shelf,

01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:13.000
it's always these giant fluorescent colors.

01:53:13.000 --> 01:53:16.000
There's crazy blue and screaming yellow,

01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:19.000
and just screaming Mr. Smoosh in the background over there.

01:53:19.000 --> 01:53:22.000
Screaming yellow and red and all these very bright colors.

01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:26.000
So, this bright green that they're looking at doing the Xbox Links in

01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:27.000
is no different.

01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:32.000
But how do you feel about game makers getting into body washes?

01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:37.000
It makes sense, and if it gets some people aware to bathe themselves,

01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:39.000
then I'm all for it.

01:53:39.000 --> 01:53:42.000
I just couldn't help but laugh my ass off

01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:45.000
when this was the first thing I saw after I read that article

01:53:45.000 --> 01:53:48.000
about how some dude wants to do a straight pride parade in Boston.

01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:55.000
I was like, oh, Xbox Axe, here's some official gear.

01:53:55.000 --> 01:53:58.000
Although, I don't know if you saw what Axe Body Spray said

01:53:58.000 --> 01:54:00.000
to somebody on Twitter,

01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:03.000
but I've got to say, props to Axe.

01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:08.000
Axe posted a happy pride like a lot of corporations do this month,

01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:10.000
and of course they got that response that was like,

01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:13.000
gay people shouldn't be celebrated, blah, blah, blah.

01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:16.000
And Axe responded something to the effect of,

01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:17.000
I don't have it right in front of me,

01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:18.000
Axe responded something to the effect of,

01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:21.000
gay rights are human rights, but go off, Jill.

01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:28.000
And as much as I'm not a big fan

01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:32.000
of the humanizing of brand accounts on Twitter

01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:35.000
because they're everywhere, that one was fucking funny.

01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:41.000
I always appreciate a good dragging

01:54:41.000 --> 01:54:44.000
of somebody who is completely wrong on that issue.

01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:48.000
Anyway, SheHulk10 in chat says,

01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:51.000
I would like to smell like a new Xbox.

01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:59.000
Does it smell like burning components?

01:54:59.000 --> 01:55:02.000
Does the red ring of death smell?

01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:04.000
They don't say what it smells like.

01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:07.000
It smells like green, I guess, I don't know.

01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:08.000
Green.

01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:09.000
Yeah, it's that.

01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:12.000
Anyway, I will check in to see if there's any last minute stories,

01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:14.000
but some folks in chat are commenting on Mr. Smoosh.

01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:17.000
S2 and Hunter Matt saying, Mr. Smoosh has E3 breaking news.

01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:18.000
Feed me and give me attention.

01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:19.000
Can you guys hear?

01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:20.000
That is really loud.

01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:21.000
He's very, very big.

01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:24.000
He knows it's about dinner time,

01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:27.000
and his other dad should be home right now to feed him,

01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:30.000
but my understanding is that his other dad

01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:33.000
is in line at Target right now, so he's not home yet.

01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:37.000
So, I think Mr. Smoosh is just very anxious for some wet food,

01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:41.000
even though the fat boy got dry food just a couple hours ago, didn't he?

01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:43.000
You want to come make a cameo?

01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:44.000
Mr. Smoosh?

01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:45.000
Smoosh?

01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:47.000
You want to come make a cameo?

01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:48.000
I'm going to try.

01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:49.000
He's like, no.

01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:50.000
No, he's just going to stay out of there and look.

01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:51.000
Sorry, guys.

01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:52.000
All right.

01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:53.000
Anyway.

01:55:53.000 --> 01:55:54.000
He'll come to me.

01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:55.000
Oh, is he coming over?

01:55:55.000 --> 01:55:56.000
That doesn't mean he'll get picked up on cam, though.

01:55:56.000 --> 01:55:59.000
He's got to get up on the couch in order to get up on cam.

01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:01.000
Well, maybe he can come up here.

01:56:01.000 --> 01:56:02.000
Look, I got food.

01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:03.000
Food over here.

01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:04.000
How's that?

01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:05.000
He smells of food.

01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:07.000
All right, we're going to get to a call while Loki continues

01:56:07.000 --> 01:56:09.000
to try to placate Mr. Smoosh here.

01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:13.000
Let's get to it, and then I'll ask for a last minute story.

01:56:13.000 --> 01:56:14.000
But first, we have a call.

01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:15.000
Hi, you're on Orange Moms Radio.

01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:16.000
Who's this?

01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:17.000
Hey, what's going on, everyone?

01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:18.000
I hit you on the...

01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:19.000
Hey, Rama.

01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:20.000
Good to hear from you.

01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:21.000
Wow, you're coming through loud.

01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:23.000
Sorry if it's echoing back to those of you that are listening live.

01:56:23.000 --> 01:56:25.000
I'll try to adjust the volume on the fly.

01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:27.000
What's on your mind tonight, buddy?

01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:30.000
Not too much, and I'm also adjusting the volume on the fly on my end, too,

01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:32.000
just to be on the safe side.

01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:33.000
No worries.

01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:34.000
What's on your mind tonight?

01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:35.000
All right.

01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:41.000
I saw the Microsoft compressor, and I was done at PSO2.

01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:44.000
I was absolutely done.

01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:47.000
Did you see the opening to tonight's show?

01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:51.000
I probably missed it because I was on my way back from another outing

01:56:51.000 --> 01:56:55.000
because I had been out all week, and as soon as I came home...

01:56:55.000 --> 01:56:56.000
It's all right.

01:56:56.000 --> 01:56:57.000
It's all right.

01:56:57.000 --> 01:56:58.000
Go back and watch it.

01:56:58.000 --> 01:57:00.000
Hopefully, somebody clipped it, but if they didn't, then go back

01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:02.000
and watch it at some point.

01:57:02.000 --> 01:57:03.000
I will.

01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:05.000
I will.

01:57:05.000 --> 01:57:08.000
So you're excited about PSO2 as well?

01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:09.000
Yes.

01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:11.000
I mean, they put it frankly.

01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:12.000
I'm like...

01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:13.000
I'm watching here.

01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:14.000
I'm like, no.

01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:15.000
No way.

01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:16.000
No way.

01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:17.000
Then I go, wait.

01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:18.000
That's not a carrier.

01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:19.000
No, no, no, no.

01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:20.000
That's got to be PSO2.

01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:21.000
Right in there.

01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:25.000
I looked at the screen, and I looked at my laundry.

01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:26.000
The fresh laundry.

01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:27.000
Screen.

01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:28.000
Yeah.

01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:30.000
I changed my underwear after seeing that.

01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:32.000
I was done.

01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:36.000
So you are also hype about PSO2.

01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:40.000
I expressed a reservation that this game's been out for years and years

01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:41.000
and years.

01:57:41.000 --> 01:57:42.000
How are they going to keep it fresh and interesting?

01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:44.000
Do you have any reservations of that sort?

01:57:44.000 --> 01:57:47.000
Or are you just like, no, just put it in my veins?

01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:48.000
Not really.

01:57:48.000 --> 01:57:50.000
I mean, the fact that it's going to be free to play

01:57:50.000 --> 01:57:52.000
and they're giving us all of the expansions,

01:57:52.000 --> 01:57:56.000
I think they're going to do right by us.

01:57:56.000 --> 01:57:57.000
Yeah.

01:57:57.000 --> 01:58:02.000
I'm just trying not to get my expectations up too high

01:58:02.000 --> 01:58:06.000
so that I'm pleasantly surprised when it exceeds my low expectations,

01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:11.000
which I think is a good thing to do in general, right?

01:58:11.000 --> 01:58:15.000
Basically, go in expecting the best but preparing for the worst.

01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:16.000
Yeah.

01:58:16.000 --> 01:58:19.000
So did anything else at the Microsoft Presser catch your eye,

01:58:19.000 --> 01:58:23.000
or is it like everything else is a blur because of that?

01:58:23.000 --> 01:58:26.000
Battletoads, I was like, oh, yeah?

01:58:26.000 --> 01:58:27.000
For real?

01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:28.000
Okay.

01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:29.000
Game on.

01:58:29.000 --> 01:58:33.000
What did you think about the Game Pass that they're offering?

01:58:33.000 --> 01:58:38.000
The $14.99 a month gold plus Game Pass on Xbox plus Game Pass on PC?

01:58:38.000 --> 01:58:43.000
Because I have to admit, the fact that now Game Pass is on PC

01:58:43.000 --> 01:58:47.000
and it's bundled with like Xbox Live for the console and then the Xbox,

01:58:47.000 --> 01:58:49.000
I'm kind of interested, I think.

01:58:49.000 --> 01:58:50.000
What were your thoughts?

01:58:50.000 --> 01:58:53.000
I kind of feel Microsoft is spreading themselves thin with that,

01:58:53.000 --> 01:58:57.000
but on the same token, they're trying to incorporate everybody.

01:58:57.000 --> 01:59:00.000
But I don't game enough to say that this is a worth value,

01:59:00.000 --> 01:59:03.000
so if anybody else is going to get it,

01:59:03.000 --> 01:59:06.000
they'll probably enjoy it a lot better than I would.

01:59:06.000 --> 01:59:08.000
Fair enough. Fair enough.

01:59:08.000 --> 01:59:11.000
Well, anything else you want to say about Microsoft's event tonight?

01:59:11.000 --> 01:59:13.000
Cyberpunk 2077, bro.

01:59:13.000 --> 01:59:15.000
Yeah, that game looks pretty hot.

01:59:15.000 --> 01:59:18.000
What about Keanu?

01:59:18.000 --> 01:59:20.000
Now, y'all know me.

01:59:20.000 --> 01:59:23.000
I am the cheap gamer.

01:59:23.000 --> 01:59:26.000
You have to have a really good reason for me to go out

01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:30.000
and buy a game day one and pay it a $60 price.

01:59:30.000 --> 01:59:34.000
I was already looking into picking up 2077.

01:59:34.000 --> 01:59:37.000
I really enjoyed the trailer from last year

01:59:37.000 --> 01:59:39.000
and the 45-minute game playthrough.

01:59:39.000 --> 01:59:42.000
I'm like, okay, I'm going to enjoy this.

01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:45.000
This was just the icing on the cake for me.

01:59:45.000 --> 01:59:46.000
Yeah, for sure.

01:59:46.000 --> 01:59:51.000
I think Keanu is a nice cherry on top of this dessert

01:59:51.000 --> 01:59:54.000
many people were waiting for already, so it was very, very awesome.

01:59:54.000 --> 02:00:01.000
The real question is, though, since this is a game where you can romance people,

02:00:01.000 --> 02:00:03.000
are you going to be able to romance Keanu Reeves?

02:00:03.000 --> 02:00:05.000
Oh, yeah. One of my friends wrote a tweet that said,

02:00:05.000 --> 02:00:09.000
when do I get to fuck Keanu Reeves?

02:00:09.000 --> 02:00:12.000
And I just retweeted it. I thought it was funny.

02:00:12.000 --> 02:00:15.000
I might have to find that tweet and retweet it my own self.

02:00:15.000 --> 02:00:19.000
Yes. All right. Well, Rama, anything else on your mind tonight?

02:00:19.000 --> 02:00:22.000
In response to the article about Xbox body wash,

02:00:22.000 --> 02:00:26.000
the irony is when that article first popped up,

02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:31.000
I have been seeing this grassroots campaign

02:00:31.000 --> 02:00:38.000
to telling people when you go to conventions, shower, wash yourself, shower, do that.

02:00:38.000 --> 02:00:41.000
And it's like, this is popping up.

02:00:41.000 --> 02:00:44.000
I'm like, you know, even Microsoft is telling you,

02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:47.000
you need to leave the game room for five minutes,

02:00:47.000 --> 02:00:53.000
go up to your room, shower, come back downstairs, and then game some more.

02:00:53.000 --> 02:00:56.000
Rama, I wouldn't expect you to know of this YouTube celebrity,

02:00:56.000 --> 02:00:59.000
but I'm going to share this YouTube celebrity for you.

02:00:59.000 --> 02:01:01.000
This particular celebrity is very famous right now

02:01:01.000 --> 02:01:04.000
because there's a little short clip circulating around the internet

02:01:04.000 --> 02:01:08.000
where she goes, and her name is Jasmine Masters,

02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:10.000
and she's an amazing queen from RuPaul's Drag Race.

02:01:10.000 --> 02:01:13.000
And she has this whole series, and you just need to find it on YouTube

02:01:13.000 --> 02:01:16.000
where she talks about, you need to wash your ass,

02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:18.000
and you need to scrub your balls.

02:01:18.000 --> 02:01:20.000
And she goes this whole thing on it,

02:01:20.000 --> 02:01:22.000
and I think it's something that should be required viewing

02:01:22.000 --> 02:01:24.000
before going to a convention.

02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:28.000
She's not gone. I'm telling you, she's not gone.

02:01:29.000 --> 02:01:32.000
I walked into the game room,

02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:36.000
and I felt like my mother slapped the living shit out of me

02:01:36.000 --> 02:01:39.000
because of how strong that funk was.

02:01:39.000 --> 02:01:42.000
I'm like, I should have brought my console from home

02:01:42.000 --> 02:01:44.000
and stayed in my damn room.

02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:48.000
God, I can tell you stories of the fanboy funk.

02:01:48.000 --> 02:01:54.000
If I ever, if I ever get to the day where VOG Network has a convention,

02:01:54.000 --> 02:01:57.000
I'm going to have that Jasmine Masters videos on loop

02:01:57.000 --> 02:01:58.000
in the registration line.

02:01:58.000 --> 02:02:00.000
Please do. I mean, there are already,

02:02:00.000 --> 02:02:03.000
there was this convention in the mid-Atlantic, Midwest,

02:02:03.000 --> 02:02:08.000
Colossal Kong, they were giving out small things of deodorant.

02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:11.000
You didn't have, there wasn't, it was like, here, take it.

02:02:11.000 --> 02:02:12.000
You know?

02:02:12.000 --> 02:02:15.000
Nifty 805 in chat says,

02:02:15.000 --> 02:02:19.000
I remember that gamer X attendees smell lovely.

02:02:19.000 --> 02:02:21.000
We'll just do this.

02:02:21.000 --> 02:02:26.000
Instead of bomb sniffing dogs, we'll get like B.O. sniffing dogs,

02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:29.000
and so they can sniff out the people that are really rank,

02:02:29.000 --> 02:02:33.000
and we can like, yeah.

02:02:33.000 --> 02:02:35.000
Dog is very disturbed by your smells, sir.

02:02:35.000 --> 02:02:37.000
You can have eggs at the line.

02:02:37.000 --> 02:02:38.000
Wow.

02:02:38.000 --> 02:02:42.000
Speaking of all this, did you see SacAnime this weekend downtown?

02:02:42.000 --> 02:02:43.000
I heard that it was going on.

02:02:43.000 --> 02:02:44.000
I heard it was going on.

02:02:44.000 --> 02:02:47.000
They had SacAnime the same freaking, okay,

02:02:47.000 --> 02:02:49.000
so usually I can't go to SacAnime

02:02:49.000 --> 02:02:51.000
because it's the same weekend as Dragon Con, right?

02:02:51.000 --> 02:02:53.000
So they move it to a different date this year,

02:02:53.000 --> 02:02:55.000
and they put it the same weekend as Pride.

02:02:56.000 --> 02:02:59.000
Well, there's multiple Prides going on in New York.

02:02:59.000 --> 02:03:01.000
Like, last Sunday was Queen's Pride.

02:03:01.000 --> 02:03:06.000
I'm going to New York Pride at the end of the month as the token straight,

02:03:06.000 --> 02:03:08.000
so, you know.

02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:10.000
Allies are important.

02:03:10.000 --> 02:03:12.000
It's good to have them close, yeah.

02:03:12.000 --> 02:03:13.000
True.

02:03:13.000 --> 02:03:14.000
All right.

02:03:14.000 --> 02:03:16.000
Well, Rama, I'm going to let you go,

02:03:16.000 --> 02:03:19.000
but before I do let you go, I just want to remind you, Rama,

02:03:19.000 --> 02:03:21.000
you're breathtaking.

02:03:21.000 --> 02:03:23.000
Aw, I get it from y'all.

02:03:23.000 --> 02:03:25.000
I learn it from y'all, so, you know.

02:03:25.000 --> 02:03:26.000
Excellent.

02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:27.000
Excellent response.

02:03:27.000 --> 02:03:28.000
I approve.

02:03:28.000 --> 02:03:29.000
All right.

02:03:29.000 --> 02:03:30.000
Take care, buddy.

02:03:30.000 --> 02:03:31.000
It's always good to hear from you.

02:03:31.000 --> 02:03:32.000
Later, fam.

02:03:32.000 --> 02:03:33.000
Bye.

02:03:33.000 --> 02:03:34.000
All right.

02:03:34.000 --> 02:03:35.000
Do we have any?

02:03:35.000 --> 02:03:37.000
I don't see anybody else in the green room right now,

02:03:37.000 --> 02:03:39.000
but do we have any other stories to talk about?

02:03:39.000 --> 02:03:40.000
Yes.

02:03:40.000 --> 02:03:42.000
Let's talk about some of the stuff from Devolver Digital.

02:03:42.000 --> 02:03:44.000
Yes, since they've been going on,

02:03:44.000 --> 02:03:46.000
and we kind of were doing a show about that.

02:03:46.000 --> 02:03:48.000
So this is an announcement I was not expecting.

02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:50.000
So, you know, enter the Gungeon.

02:03:50.000 --> 02:03:54.000
Well, they announced a brand-new game in the enter the Gungeon series

02:03:54.000 --> 02:03:59.000
called Enter the Gungeon House of the Gun Dead.

02:03:59.000 --> 02:04:00.000
Nice.

02:04:00.000 --> 02:04:03.000
It's an arcade shooter game.

02:04:03.000 --> 02:04:04.000
Oh, that's kind of cool.

02:04:04.000 --> 02:04:05.000
It's an arcade gun game.

02:04:05.000 --> 02:04:06.000
So it's separate.

02:04:06.000 --> 02:04:07.000
It's not DLC or something.

02:04:07.000 --> 02:04:09.000
It's going to be in arcades.

02:04:09.000 --> 02:04:11.000
Oh, shit.

02:04:11.000 --> 02:04:12.000
That's pretty cool.

02:04:12.000 --> 02:04:13.000
Yes.

02:04:13.000 --> 02:04:14.000
Oh, nice.

02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:16.000
So I am totally down for that.

02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:17.000
That's really cool.

02:04:17.000 --> 02:04:18.000
And then, of course,

02:04:18.000 --> 02:04:21.000
they announced a Devolver bootleg collection.

02:04:21.000 --> 02:04:25.000
It's all these bootleg games of their games.

02:04:25.000 --> 02:04:26.000
It's hilarious.

02:04:26.000 --> 02:04:28.000
They did like Enter the Gun Dungeon,

02:04:28.000 --> 02:04:32.000
or Hotline Milwaukee, Ape Out Junior.

02:04:32.000 --> 02:04:34.000
So they took a bunch of people that hacked their games?

02:04:34.000 --> 02:04:37.000
No, I think they made their own bootleg games of their own games.

02:04:37.000 --> 02:04:38.000
Oh, okay.

02:04:38.000 --> 02:04:39.000
That's so weird.

02:04:39.000 --> 02:04:40.000
Shooty Boots,

02:04:41.000 --> 02:04:44.000
Super Absolver Mini Turbo Fighting Championship,

02:04:44.000 --> 02:04:45.000
Catsylvania.

02:04:45.000 --> 02:04:46.000
It's a cat game.

02:04:46.000 --> 02:04:47.000
Catsylvania?

02:04:47.000 --> 02:04:49.000
It's a cat inside of a suit of armor.

02:04:49.000 --> 02:04:51.000
It's a cat in full-played armor.

02:04:51.000 --> 02:04:53.000
What else do you want?

02:04:53.000 --> 02:04:55.000
Just that game, TBH.

02:04:55.000 --> 02:04:56.000
I want that.

02:04:56.000 --> 02:04:58.000
Luft Trousers,

02:04:58.000 --> 02:04:59.000
Pee-book,

02:04:59.000 --> 02:05:00.000
Pekoo,

02:05:00.000 --> 02:05:02.000
Pekoo Ball Stars.

02:05:02.000 --> 02:05:04.000
I have no idea what that is.

02:05:04.000 --> 02:05:05.000
But it sounds hilarious.

02:05:05.000 --> 02:05:08.000
And it's on Steam right now for $4.94

02:05:08.000 --> 02:05:09.000
for eight games.

02:05:09.000 --> 02:05:11.000
I heard it's 1% off right now.

02:05:11.000 --> 02:05:12.000
1% off, yes.

02:05:12.000 --> 02:05:13.000
1% off.

02:05:13.000 --> 02:05:14.000
That's a pretty good price.

02:05:14.000 --> 02:05:16.000
Oh, there we go.

02:05:16.000 --> 02:05:18.000
More late-breaking news just coming in.

02:05:18.000 --> 02:05:20.000
So, you know how we're supposed to hear the date

02:05:20.000 --> 02:05:22.000
of the Final Fantasy VII Remake at that concert?

02:05:22.000 --> 02:05:23.000
Yeah.

02:05:23.000 --> 02:05:24.000
It just came out.

02:05:24.000 --> 02:05:26.000
March 3rd, 2020 was announced as the date.

02:05:26.000 --> 02:05:27.000
March 3rd, 2020.

02:05:27.000 --> 02:05:29.000
So, it was this winter,

02:05:29.000 --> 02:05:31.000
but it's like the last days of winter.

02:05:31.000 --> 02:05:33.000
So, but there it is.

02:05:33.000 --> 02:05:35.000
March 3rd, 2020 Final Fantasy VII Remake.

02:05:35.000 --> 02:05:36.000
It's happening.

02:05:37.000 --> 02:05:38.000
Cool.

02:05:38.000 --> 02:05:40.000
I'm not gonna lie.

02:05:40.000 --> 02:05:41.000
I'm gonna be there day one.

02:05:41.000 --> 02:05:42.000
I'm excited for it.

02:05:42.000 --> 02:05:44.000
I know a lot of y'all love to hate on VII,

02:05:44.000 --> 02:05:45.000
and that's fine,

02:05:45.000 --> 02:05:48.000
but I'm really excited to kind of check it out

02:05:48.000 --> 02:05:49.000
with these souped-up graphics

02:05:49.000 --> 02:05:51.000
and sort of like for a new generation there.

02:05:51.000 --> 02:05:52.000
So, it's really, really cool.

02:05:52.000 --> 02:05:54.000
I was gonna say other things that I saw this week

02:05:54.000 --> 02:05:55.000
that were pretty cool.

02:05:55.000 --> 02:05:58.000
They announced the remake for Destroy All Humans,

02:05:58.000 --> 02:05:59.000
which is awesome.

02:05:59.000 --> 02:06:01.000
And Romshine in the trailer, of course.

02:06:01.000 --> 02:06:03.000
It's gonna be fantastic.

02:06:05.000 --> 02:06:09.000
They have a remake of the SpongeBob,

02:06:09.000 --> 02:06:13.000
Battle for Bikini Bottom or something that they're doing.

02:06:13.000 --> 02:06:14.000
That's kind of random.

02:06:14.000 --> 02:06:15.000
I'm surprised.

02:06:15.000 --> 02:06:17.000
I know Activision has like...

02:06:17.000 --> 02:06:19.000
They need to do a SpongeBob meme game.

02:06:19.000 --> 02:06:21.000
There's so many SpongeBob memes now.

02:06:21.000 --> 02:06:23.000
There's the whole like the all caps

02:06:23.000 --> 02:06:26.000
when you say something sarcastically back to somebody,

02:06:26.000 --> 02:06:27.000
that whole thing.

02:06:27.000 --> 02:06:28.000
And then now I'm seeing one

02:06:28.000 --> 02:06:30.000
where they put SpongeBob in like all these weird,

02:06:30.000 --> 02:06:31.000
I don't even know,

02:06:31.000 --> 02:06:34.000
it's like these weird places and scenery and yeah.

02:06:34.000 --> 02:06:37.000
And it's like me when I show up to the place alone,

02:06:37.000 --> 02:06:38.000
or something like that.

02:06:38.000 --> 02:06:39.000
SpongeBob memes are everywhere,

02:06:39.000 --> 02:06:41.000
so you should make a game out of it.

02:06:41.000 --> 02:06:42.000
Yeah.

02:06:42.000 --> 02:06:44.000
Or Sonic the Hedgehog memes.

02:06:44.000 --> 02:06:45.000
Yes.

02:06:46.000 --> 02:06:47.000
Perfect.

02:06:48.000 --> 02:06:49.000
So, yeah.

02:06:49.000 --> 02:06:51.000
I guess that's it.

02:06:51.000 --> 02:06:53.000
That's all I got for now.

02:06:53.000 --> 02:06:54.000
I mean, I'm sure there's stuff

02:06:54.000 --> 02:06:55.000
that we're forgetting out there.

02:06:55.000 --> 02:06:56.000
Yeah.

02:06:56.000 --> 02:06:57.000
They talked about Carrion.

02:06:57.000 --> 02:06:58.000
That was another announcement

02:06:58.000 --> 02:06:59.000
that they have for Devolver Digital,

02:06:59.000 --> 02:07:00.000
but that one's kind of cool.

02:07:00.000 --> 02:07:02.000
It's a reverse horror game.

02:07:02.000 --> 02:07:04.000
You play like almost like The Thing,

02:07:04.000 --> 02:07:06.000
and you're going around and infecting people

02:07:06.000 --> 02:07:09.000
into this giant, amorphous, massive body parts,

02:07:09.000 --> 02:07:11.000
and it's kind of horrific,

02:07:11.000 --> 02:07:14.000
but fun because you're attacking people.

02:07:14.000 --> 02:07:15.000
Yeah.

02:07:15.000 --> 02:07:16.000
Okay.

02:07:16.000 --> 02:07:17.000
Yeah.

02:07:17.000 --> 02:07:18.000
Good times.

02:07:18.000 --> 02:07:19.000
All right.

02:07:19.000 --> 02:07:20.000
Well, I don't see any other calls waiting on the line,

02:07:20.000 --> 02:07:21.000
so I guess we'll move to start

02:07:21.000 --> 02:07:22.000
to wrap things up here a little bit,

02:07:22.000 --> 02:07:24.000
even though for being E3 week,

02:07:24.000 --> 02:07:25.000
it was a little bit of a shorter show.

02:07:25.000 --> 02:07:27.000
But we're only part way through E3.

02:07:27.000 --> 02:07:29.000
There's still so much more news to come,

02:07:29.000 --> 02:07:30.000
so it's a bummer we have to wait

02:07:30.000 --> 02:07:31.000
all the way till next Sunday

02:07:31.000 --> 02:07:32.000
to talk about it again.

02:07:32.000 --> 02:07:35.000
But of course, you can always follow the show on Twitter,

02:07:35.000 --> 02:07:37.000
at OLR, or my personal Twitter,

02:07:37.000 --> 02:07:38.000
at MrRobRoberts.

02:07:38.000 --> 02:07:39.000
Loki's on Twitter,

02:07:39.000 --> 02:07:40.000
at LokiOLR.

02:07:40.000 --> 02:07:42.000
And then Dark Soccer is also on Twitter as well,

02:07:42.000 --> 02:07:43.000
at Dark Soccer,

02:07:43.000 --> 02:07:44.000
although she tends to be more

02:07:44.000 --> 02:07:47.000
of a Facebook-y slash Tumblr person,

02:07:47.000 --> 02:07:49.000
which we missed Dark Soccer tonight,

02:07:49.000 --> 02:07:51.000
but she will be back to join us next week.

02:07:51.000 --> 02:07:53.000
And of course, in seven days,

02:07:53.000 --> 02:07:56.000
we'll know what Nintendo's got planned for the next year.

02:07:56.000 --> 02:07:57.000
Animal Crossing.

02:07:57.000 --> 02:07:58.000
Yeah, let's Animal Crossing.

02:07:58.000 --> 02:08:01.000
You think we'll get any surprises out of Nintendo

02:08:01.000 --> 02:08:03.000
and what they do?

02:08:03.000 --> 02:08:04.000
The funny thing is,

02:08:04.000 --> 02:08:05.000
for those that listen on the podcast,

02:08:05.000 --> 02:08:07.000
some people are gonna hear this,

02:08:07.000 --> 02:08:09.000
possibly after Nintendo's already done their thing,

02:08:09.000 --> 02:08:11.000
and how stupid these predictions might be.

02:08:11.000 --> 02:08:12.000
But anything-

02:08:12.000 --> 02:08:13.000
Okay, let's make predictions then.

02:08:13.000 --> 02:08:14.000
Why not?

02:08:14.000 --> 02:08:16.000
All right, what do you think Nintendo's gonna do?

02:08:16.000 --> 02:08:18.000
They're gonna have Animal Crossing.

02:08:18.000 --> 02:08:21.000
They're gonna talk about Pokemon again a little bit.

02:08:21.000 --> 02:08:24.000
They may talk about Mario Maker 2 a little bit.

02:08:24.000 --> 02:08:26.000
I think as far as I'm concerned,

02:08:26.000 --> 02:08:30.000
we're gonna see maybe something for Bayonetta 3,

02:08:30.000 --> 02:08:36.000
and I would be willing to bet Minecraft Steve for Smash.

02:08:36.000 --> 02:08:38.000
Okay, Minecraft Steve for Smash.

02:08:38.000 --> 02:08:39.000
That's an interesting one.

02:08:39.000 --> 02:08:42.000
Let's see, for me, Animal Crossing's a given.

02:08:42.000 --> 02:08:46.000
Link's Awakening remake is on the lanyards at E3, apparently,

02:08:46.000 --> 02:08:47.000
so that's definitely gonna be a focus.

02:08:47.000 --> 02:08:48.000
Right, I would expect that would be...

02:08:48.000 --> 02:08:50.000
They could be talking a little bit more of that.

02:08:50.000 --> 02:08:52.000
I thought that would be more of a treehouse thing.

02:08:52.000 --> 02:08:53.000
Yeah.

02:08:53.000 --> 02:08:55.000
No, I think especially now that Metroid Prime 4

02:08:55.000 --> 02:08:57.000
kind of fell off the calendar for them,

02:08:57.000 --> 02:08:59.000
I think there are probably gonna be other games

02:08:59.000 --> 02:09:00.000
that they're kind of boosting up

02:09:00.000 --> 02:09:03.000
to kind of make sure that this holiday is okay for them.

02:09:03.000 --> 02:09:06.000
Super Nintendo games, maybe for...

02:09:06.000 --> 02:09:07.000
Here's hoping.

02:09:07.000 --> 02:09:08.000
Nintendo Channel tipping.

02:09:08.000 --> 02:09:10.000
Yeah, for the Famicom channel.

02:09:10.000 --> 02:09:12.000
Or the Famicom channel.

02:09:12.000 --> 02:09:13.000
You know what I mean.

02:09:13.000 --> 02:09:14.000
Switch online.

02:09:14.000 --> 02:09:15.000
NES.

02:09:15.000 --> 02:09:16.000
They should do Nintendo 64.

02:09:16.000 --> 02:09:18.000
They should just do all these things.

02:09:18.000 --> 02:09:20.000
Super Nintendo games would be great.

02:09:20.000 --> 02:09:23.000
I'd really be excited for that.

02:09:23.000 --> 02:09:25.000
Secret of Mana remake.

02:09:25.000 --> 02:09:26.000
We are... Not the remake.

02:09:26.000 --> 02:09:27.000
The collection.

02:09:27.000 --> 02:09:28.000
Second Densetsu collection.

02:09:28.000 --> 02:09:31.000
I'm gonna put stock that that's probably real.

02:09:31.000 --> 02:09:33.000
Could that be a Square Enix thing?

02:09:33.000 --> 02:09:35.000
Ooh, yeah, we may hear about that tomorrow

02:09:35.000 --> 02:09:36.000
at Square Enix thing.

02:09:36.000 --> 02:09:37.000
That's true.

02:09:37.000 --> 02:09:38.000
So I'm gonna hope that that's real

02:09:38.000 --> 02:09:39.000
and coming out on the Switch,

02:09:39.000 --> 02:09:40.000
and that's gonna be the first time

02:09:40.000 --> 02:09:41.000
we get Second Densetsu 3,

02:09:41.000 --> 02:09:43.000
and that's gonna be a big fucking deal.

02:09:43.000 --> 02:09:45.000
You talk about Phantasy Star Online 2 being old

02:09:45.000 --> 02:09:46.000
and us finally getting it,

02:09:46.000 --> 02:09:48.000
and that's gonna be the first time

02:09:48.000 --> 02:09:50.000
we get Second Densetsu 3 being old and us finally getting it.

02:09:50.000 --> 02:09:52.000
Let's talk about Second Densetsu 3, okay?

02:09:52.000 --> 02:09:54.000
That'll be a pretty big fucking deal.

02:09:54.000 --> 02:09:55.000
So there's that.

02:09:55.000 --> 02:09:57.000
And I'm trying to think.

02:09:57.000 --> 02:10:00.000
I would say I think I'm gonna go with something,

02:10:00.000 --> 02:10:02.000
and Flacco had said this on Twitter,

02:10:02.000 --> 02:10:03.000
and I think we're due for it.

02:10:03.000 --> 02:10:05.000
I think a new Splatoon game could happen.

02:10:05.000 --> 02:10:10.000
Because we know the final Splatoon 2 is happening.

02:10:10.000 --> 02:10:13.000
The final Splatfest for Splatoon 2 is happening.

02:10:13.000 --> 02:10:15.000
Thank you, Alan.

02:10:15.000 --> 02:10:16.000
Product placement.

02:10:16.000 --> 02:10:17.000
My God, Alan brought me snackies.

02:10:17.000 --> 02:10:19.000
Oh, the Caramel one? Yeah.

02:10:19.000 --> 02:10:21.000
Yeah, the Caramel ones are hella good.

02:10:21.000 --> 02:10:23.000
Anyway, but they didn't pay me to say that.

02:10:25.000 --> 02:10:27.000
Oh, so I think it's Splatoon 3.

02:10:27.000 --> 02:10:29.000
Why not? We're ready.

02:10:29.000 --> 02:10:32.000
I was gonna say, as far as Square Enix goes,

02:10:32.000 --> 02:10:35.000
Final Fantasy XI Mobile?

02:10:35.000 --> 02:10:38.000
Eh? When the hell is that gonna be announced?

02:10:38.000 --> 02:10:40.000
And let's just throw something way out there.

02:10:40.000 --> 02:10:42.000
Chugua Racing mobile game.

02:10:42.000 --> 02:10:45.000
I don't want them to talk about Final Fantasy XIV.

02:10:45.000 --> 02:10:48.000
Because we already know everything from Final Fantasy XIV expansion.

02:10:48.000 --> 02:10:50.000
Don't retread that ground tomorrow.

02:10:50.000 --> 02:10:54.000
Unless they're gonna announce Final Fantasy XIV for the Xbox One.

02:10:54.000 --> 02:10:56.000
I think we're due for another Hitman game.

02:10:56.000 --> 02:10:58.000
Could be that.

02:10:58.000 --> 02:10:59.000
Yeah, that'd be good too.

02:10:59.000 --> 02:11:02.000
Alright, well that's gonna do it for another episode of Orange Country.

02:11:02.000 --> 02:11:05.000
We will be back in seven days to recap the second half of E3

02:11:05.000 --> 02:11:07.000
and all these things that we're thinking about now.

02:11:07.000 --> 02:11:11.000
And then of course you guys hopefully to chat along with us here in chat.

02:11:11.000 --> 02:11:13.000
And Dark Soccer will be back as well.

02:11:13.000 --> 02:11:14.000
And we'll have a good old time.

02:11:14.000 --> 02:11:15.000
Enjoy E3.

02:11:15.000 --> 02:11:17.000
Anybody that we know that happens to be there,

02:11:17.000 --> 02:11:19.000
we hope that you're having a good time at the show.

02:11:19.000 --> 02:11:23.000
And have a drink for us at one of the fun after parties in the area.

02:11:23.000 --> 02:11:25.000
And it'll be a good time.

02:11:25.000 --> 02:11:27.000
So, final thoughts time.

02:11:27.000 --> 02:11:29.000
You have a final thought for us, Loki.

02:11:29.000 --> 02:11:31.000
It's funny, in chat they say,

02:11:31.000 --> 02:11:35.000
I predict Loki will delete the code to time the car live on stream

02:11:35.000 --> 02:11:38.000
to stop people from mentioning it before Half-Life 3 comes out.

02:11:38.000 --> 02:11:41.000
Funny enough, I would actually play that game on stream

02:11:41.000 --> 02:11:44.000
I thought that the modern Unity can open it up

02:11:44.000 --> 02:11:47.000
and actually I can render it as an executable.

02:11:47.000 --> 02:11:49.000
But I don't know if I can.

02:11:49.000 --> 02:11:50.000
I'll try it.

02:11:50.000 --> 02:11:53.000
But I think you'll break it if I try to import it into...

02:11:53.000 --> 02:11:55.000
Because I did that in Unity 5.

02:11:55.000 --> 02:11:57.000
And we're like on 2019 now.

02:11:57.000 --> 02:12:01.000
So I'd have to dig up a really old copy of Unity in order to open that up.

02:12:01.000 --> 02:12:02.000
Fair enough.

02:12:02.000 --> 02:12:03.000
Or actually it might have been Unity 4.

02:12:03.000 --> 02:12:05.000
I don't know. It's really old.

02:12:05.000 --> 02:12:08.000
As I always say, towards the end of every episode of Orange Country Radio,

02:12:08.000 --> 02:12:09.000
help us spread the word.

02:12:09.000 --> 02:12:10.000
Tell a friend or two about the show.

02:12:10.000 --> 02:12:12.000
Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice

02:12:12.000 --> 02:12:15.000
but only if the voices are here to be able to air out there.

02:12:15.000 --> 02:12:18.000
I know we've been getting some new people coming in and watching

02:12:18.000 --> 02:12:19.000
so we really appreciate that.

02:12:19.000 --> 02:12:22.000
Hope you'll stick with us here at VoG Network.

02:12:22.000 --> 02:12:23.000
Really appreciate that.

02:12:23.000 --> 02:12:26.000
Auto hosts go a long way.

02:12:26.000 --> 02:12:29.000
So if you're not already auto hosting our channel on Twitch at VoG Network,

02:12:29.000 --> 02:12:30.000
please consider doing so.

02:12:30.000 --> 02:12:31.000
It really helps us out a lot.

02:12:31.000 --> 02:12:35.000
And Bobby, we're not just held up because of my entry into VoG Jam 1.

02:12:35.000 --> 02:12:38.000
We're also held up because of Rob's entry into VoG Jam 1.

02:12:38.000 --> 02:12:39.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:12:39.000 --> 02:12:41.000
At least I finally played him at some point.

02:12:41.000 --> 02:12:42.000
So there is that.

02:12:42.000 --> 02:12:44.000
You can't give me shit about that anymore.

02:12:44.000 --> 02:12:47.000
We've come a long way, I suppose.

02:12:47.000 --> 02:12:50.000
Alright, well that's going to do it for another episode of Orange Country Radio.

02:12:50.000 --> 02:12:53.000
Oh, my official final thought is M&M's.

02:12:53.000 --> 02:12:54.000
Yay, candy.

02:12:54.000 --> 02:12:55.000
Just what I need.

02:12:55.000 --> 02:12:56.000
The caramel ones are pretty good.

02:12:56.000 --> 02:12:57.000
Sugar rush right before I go to bed.

02:12:57.000 --> 02:12:58.000
You know what's not good though?

02:12:58.000 --> 02:12:59.000
What?

02:12:59.000 --> 02:13:01.000
The raw cookie dough place I went to the other day

02:13:01.000 --> 02:13:03.000
where they serve cookie dough like ice cream.

02:13:03.000 --> 02:13:05.000
You'd think that would be good.

02:13:05.000 --> 02:13:07.000
It is too much.

02:13:07.000 --> 02:13:08.000
Oh, I went to a place like that in Vegas.

02:13:08.000 --> 02:13:09.000
It wasn't bad.

02:13:09.000 --> 02:13:10.000
I liked it.

02:13:10.000 --> 02:13:14.000
It was sickening how rich and sugary that is.

02:13:14.000 --> 02:13:15.000
Alright.

02:13:15.000 --> 02:13:18.000
Well, on that note, we hope to be back in seven days

02:13:18.000 --> 02:13:21.000
with another rich and sugary episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

02:13:21.000 --> 02:13:24.000
And if anyone hasn't told you yet already, you're breathtaking.

02:13:24.000 --> 02:13:25.000
Good night.

02:13:25.000 --> 02:13:29.000
