00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
There's your hosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:28,000
This week, Battle Royale stretched back closer to console gaming's origins, more context given to some of the month's biggest announcements, and in happy coincidence of our 17th anniversary, Cadence of Hyrule can be played as a dancing game. Happy birthday, OLR, and thank you for all these years.

00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Orange Lounge Radio

5
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Here in studio on the show, myself, Rob Roberts, joining you here, as well as DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.

6
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Hey.

7
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Hi, how are you?

8
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm full of regret.

9
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
You looked surprised that I asked you that question, even though you would think, you know.

10
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
No, I had to think about it because, like, I still want that damn unagi.

11
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Good, I'm glad that you, look, I'm glad that DarkSakura is the type of person that will actually think about her answer to the question, then just say fine, like, do that right, how are you, fine.

12
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
How are you, you know what?

13
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
This is not fine.

14
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Everything is rotten.

15
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Everything's not awesome.

16
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I saw the second Logan movie.

17
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Also joining us, of course, Tech Master, Loki.

18
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Fine.

19
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Hi, how are you?

20
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
You're a rat.

21
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Yeah, so, as mentioned by Bobby before us, and you may have seen on Twitter, and maybe in our chat right now, because we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, at the Voice of the Geeks network, twitch.tv slash vog network, right after the Bobby Blackwell show.

22
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
And we have been taping this show various places.

23
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
The Twitch thing is a little bit newer.

24
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:12,000
It's been about six months on Twitch, but we've been taping this show various places, as you might have heard, for the past 17 years.

25
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,000
So, believe it or not, Orange and Orange Radio started on June 23, 2002.

26
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
That was our first episode.

27
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I usually, I tell the history every few months or so in case we have new people that stumble into OLR, so I'll do that again tonight since it is a birthday show.

28
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:41,000
We all met in the gaming community for the game Dance Dance Revolution, which, you know, is a game where you stomp the arrows in time with the music, which was a derivative of Beatmania.

29
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
And Spider Stomp.

30
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Yeah. And, you know, Konami's Bmoni or Beatmania Bmoni series had a whole slew of games.

31
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:54,000
So it was Guitar Freaks and Patapatapatadice and Poppin' Music, and there's plenty more.

32
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
There's newer ones, too, that you might see at arcades these days, especially if you ever go to round one.

33
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Things like what, U-Beat is like kind of a newer one.

34
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Sound Voltex, that's a relatively new one.

35
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
That was around in 2002.

36
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:15,000
But we originally started as a show dedicated to Dance Dance Revolution and all music games, because we were big fans of things like Parappa and Bust-A-Move Groove, depending on what country you're in.

37
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:22,000
And so, you know, we, so I was on a show for many years before OLR called Under Sedation.

38
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Actually, not many years.

39
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
It was really only a couple of years.

40
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I mean, it feels like many years because it was a while ago, and the show went on for many years after Travis moved, which is great.

41
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:39,000
But I was on, for a couple of years, a show called Under Sedation Live, which Travis had started as a Rocky Horror Picture Show pre-show.

42
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Yeah, that lasted.

43
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
We were, it did last.

44
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
No, I meant like as just a Rocky show.

45
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Oh, well, well, yeah, funny. It's funny because, yeah, you're right.

46
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Like the Rocky Horror Picture Show and the shadow cast it was built for probably only went about another six months, a year and a half tops after he started that show.

47
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
But Travis went on for 10 years, you know, beyond that.

48
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
And so, you know, it was fun to be honest to Travis.

49
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Oh, yeah. And part of how I knew Dark Sakura was that, you know, not only do we know each other for DDR, but Dark Sakura came and guessed it on USL a lot.

50
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
A lot.

51
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Because, you know, it was kind of like Loki the first few weeks.

52
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
She just, you know, this is a little bit more toward the end.

53
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
And then I filled in for Jessica a couple of times.

54
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Yeah, yeah.

55
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
So, yeah.

56
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,000
So anyway, but it got Jamie and I to talking about what if we had a thing like this?

57
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
So like how this is for Rocky Horror, but we do something for like DDR.

58
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Yeah.

59
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
And we can talk about DDR tournaments and we can talk about, you know, all that type of stuff.

60
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
So that's where Orange Entrada was originally born.

61
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:43,000
And so for the first few years, and again, and those of you that have found the OLR archive that Dark Tetsuya has curated of the old episodes.

62
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:49,000
If you go back and listen, I'm not going to say don't listen to old OLR, but it was a very different show because.

63
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Listen with a salt lick.

64
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Yeah, it was well a we didn't know what we were doing because there weren't a lot of rules around live broadcasting at the time.

65
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:02,000
There really weren't because the big players like NPR and stuff weren't in it, you know, at all is a very underground type of thing.

66
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
And so there weren't a lot of rules.

67
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
And it was because it was more community.

68
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
It got off topic a lot.

69
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Like we would talk a little bit about DDR, but then it was like, let's let's drink on air and see what happens when we have the microphones.

70
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Like we did crazy stuff in the early years.

71
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
It was fun.

72
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I don't regret any of it for sure.

73
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
And it brought us to where we are today.

74
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
But I think I did pay you back for your waffles.

75
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I think over the years, our show just kind of refined a little bit.

76
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:33,000
And there did come a point when Konami kind of let the money kind of go away for a bit.

77
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
They tried to bring it back.

78
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Here's the funny thing.

79
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
So like DDR Extreme had come out and what, like 2001.

80
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Right. And our show.

81
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
No, no.

82
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Two thousand two.

83
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
No, because our show started when Max 2 was out.

84
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Yeah.

85
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Stream came out like 2003, 2004.

86
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
So that probably powered our show for another year or two.

87
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
But then we kind of realized Konami is not putting anything out.

88
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
There's not a lot of music games coming out.

89
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Music games are dying.

90
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
We are having a problem filling the show.

91
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
So we said and then this was right around the same time podcasting started.

92
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
So we were actually doing and people don't always realize this.

93
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
We were doing two shows for a bit.

94
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
We were doing our live orange on radio about music games.

95
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
And then we were doing our 20 minute to go edition.

96
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Let's talk about all video.

97
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
We're talking about all the video game headlines.

98
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
And that's something people can download and it didn't last 20 minutes.

99
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
We were with the first episode did.

100
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
And then it was the next episode was 25 minutes than 30 minutes.

101
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
And before long, it was an hour.

102
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
So we were doing three hours and then another hour.

103
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
So there finally came a point finally when we said, you know what?

104
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
And I think this is after iTunes put podcasting in it.

105
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
And then like the to go edition skyrocketed.

106
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,000
We were never more popular than when iTunes put in podcasting because to go scar.

107
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:47,000
And we were sitting here with like, OK, we have 20 people that listen to all our live, which is great.

108
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
We love them. We love our all our family.

109
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:54,000
We have 2000 people that are downloading all our to go.

110
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Yeah. Which of these shows has now taken over when we feel that creatively this show over here is kind of run its course.

111
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
And this is where the hot new shit's at.

112
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:11,000
So basically, I think at the beginning of 06 or so, we ended up fusing the shows into what you hear now, Orange Lounge Radio.

113
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:21,000
So but we still consider that we've been doing a weekly show since 2002, whether it's it's like a Pokemon that has evolved several times.

114
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
So this isn't even my final form. You know what?

115
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:29,000
You know what? It's more like Digimon where it can devolve to.

116
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:42,000
But then it will always re-evolve and then combine with another thing to form like, you know, another completely new fusion Digimon and then have like extra evolutions of those forms.

117
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
So, yeah, we're more Digimon.

118
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
But yeah, I mean, like so.

119
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
So the show's kind of evolved a few times over the 17 years.

120
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:59,000
So that's, you know, and then Dark Tetsuya says, and of course, in our chat, we do tape live every Sunday night at the Voicegeeks Network at twitch.tv slash vlog network.

121
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
And we have our live chat. We love hearing from the live listeners.

122
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Dark Tetsuya says, for the record, I know there are a couple DDR themed podcasts out there, but I understand that's a niche audience, especially these days.

123
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Oh, yeah. No, I've been well aware that things have come full circle and now there are DDR themed podcasts.

124
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Yeah. And I know there's some there like even relatively new.

125
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Well, and here's the funny thing. So we kind of said we're done with the music games specifically.

126
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I mean, we'll always love music games. We still do, but we're going to focus on all games and then not not the network.

127
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Although that became a thing later on, too, before vlog network, we're going to compass on all video games.

128
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:41,000
And then so what finally happened about probably two years after we fused the show, maybe even only one year.

129
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:50,000
It wasn't long after this little company, Red Octane, that we knew from putting out the peripherals here in the U.S. to play a lot of those import games.

130
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
They said, we're going to make this little game called Guitar Hero.

131
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:59,000
And before long, within probably another year of that, by the time Guitar Hero 2 and then Rock Band is like music games were coming back.

132
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,000
And then Konami was like, let's get back into this and DDR Super.

133
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:08,000
And it's like and then also it was like, we don't know what we're doing, even though we did know what we were doing.

134
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:15,000
And in the meantime, we've aged and we're not playing DDR in the arcades as much anymore.

135
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:23,000
And so now that I'm pushing 41 here, I don't exactly play nine foot DDR level songs like I used to.

136
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I'd probably be thinner if I did.

137
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I tried. I died.

138
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Yeah, I just, you know, if I worked out, I can't do it like a lot.

139
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:40,000
But I, you know, it's now because of round one and because, you know, Konami, I think, kind of started to embrace their worldwide audience a little more and so on and so on.

140
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I think it's like DDR is kind of back in some ways.

141
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:49,000
So if this is a passing of the torch of some folks to the new generation, then that is awesome.

142
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:56,000
And maybe someday they'll run out of news too, but they'll keep it going because they enjoy what they're doing and they'll find a new topic to talk about.

143
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Not that I wish that upon DDR, but that's also the reality.

144
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Nothing's going to last forever. Right. So except maybe this show.

145
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I'm going to be 70 training some intern how to someday be a raging bitch.

146
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Someday the other media will realize we're out here someday.

147
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
You know, that'll be terrible. I stopped caring about that a long time ago.

148
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Someday my break will come. Is the reality of the situation. They're telling me I'm quiet.

149
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Sorry, guys. I don't know what's going on. Maybe I have to turn up my volume a little bit.

150
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,000
But yeah, let me ask this question while I futz with my mic here live.

151
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,000
What keeps you guys motivated to do this show?

152
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Boredom. This whole time. Boredom.

153
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Boredom? Like you have nothing better to do? Not really.

154
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Stubbornness?

155
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Honestly, like I don't want to say boredom. Let me know how that sounds, guys.

156
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I was joking about the boredom. Well, no, because I think there actually is something to that.

157
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Because I think if we didn't have O.L.R., I'd be like, what do I do?

158
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I know I do tonight. Like, what am I going to do on my Sunday night?

159
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Like, it's just like after doing something for this long, it becomes kind of a hard habit.

160
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I don't know. We can like go to Dave and Buster's and go play some DDR and then maybe go to Brookfield's afterwards.

161
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:17,000
We should do that anyway. The inevitable day this show ends because nothing lasts forever.

162
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:23,000
But even if it's in another 17 years or whatever, the inevitable day this show ends, I think that's how I'd like it to end.

163
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I think I would just like us to all, like with the camera still running, we're just going to all put down our mics and just go to RVGL and play some DDR.

164
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:37,000
And that will be how the show ends. Well, it's not going to be RVGL because their DDR machine's broken and they were trying to sell it the last time I was there.

165
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,000
So it'll have to be something like round one at that point.

166
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Oh, actually, at that point, we'll have a round one here. So maybe it'll be a little easier to find, you know, working DDR machines. So, yeah.

167
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:55,000
But anyway, yeah. So remind me, I'm forgetful sometimes, so remind me that that's how I wanted the show to end.

168
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Okay.

169
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
When we get there. Loki, what about you? What's kept you motivated for 17 years?

170
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I just wouldn't know what to do on my Sunday. And it's a good way to get away from the family.

171
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
It's like mini vacation.

172
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I actually didn't give my answer.

173
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I told you boredom was the joke.

174
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Okay. So what's the real answer?

175
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Stubbornness and being an outspoken woman in a still male patriarchal dominated industry.

176
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:33,000
No, I mean, legit. Like, you know, when we did go from 20 to 2000 listeners, legit came in some ugly shit and ignorant shit, really.

177
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:39,000
You know, and that's an unfortunate side effect of this industry that I feel like...

178
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
You just did something more original than get in the kitchen. I mean, fuck.

179
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I could think of a lot more original patriarchal things to say like, go churn butter.

180
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Or why are you not in the month house, you know, during your moon time or something?

181
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Or like if you want ways to get at dark soccer and tell her how to be a better person, I've got a list, you guys.

182
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Girl.

183
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
I'm just kidding. I adore you.

184
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
You're already perfect.

185
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
You know that. You know that. Anyway.

186
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I will smack the bitch.

187
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:17,000
But if you can churn your own butter, I mean, that's a lot of butter. The potential for that is just like, that's like, that's elevating yourself to like, you know, I don't know.

188
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Butter, butter nirvana.

189
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
I have churned butter before, by the way.

190
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:27,000
All right. Anyway, so happy 17 years to us and to all of you guys who've stuck by with us for 17 years.

191
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:32,000
So many of you guys have helped out, you know, just keeping the show going.

192
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Your advice, your friendship, your, you know, participation really in our chat and when calling in at the show and all that.

193
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Yeah, you just have been such an important part of the show and a huge part of the reason why we're still doing it.

194
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:53,000
And even if we've gone from 20 to 2000, back down to 34, it's fine.

195
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
You know what? It doesn't matter.

196
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,000
And actually, there's more that listen to. I honestly couldn't tell you how many people listen to this podcast.

197
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I stopped, I stopped.

198
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
And on top of that internationally, I mean, geez.

199
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:09,000
And two things. One, I stopped looking at the numbers a long time ago and two, I forgot the password on how to look anyway.

200
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,000
But you know what? I don't, I don't care. I truly, truly don't care.

201
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
That's like my work, you know, with the voicemail there.

202
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,000
I got, I was out like for a while and they're like, you know, you really should change your voicemail.

203
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I'm like, I don't remember how to do that. So I'm just gonna leave it.

204
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,000
It's your old hours, you know, like, eh, it's fine.

205
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:33,000
No one pays attention to that anyways. They just leave me a message.

206
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:38,000
They were really hyper about that when I still had to contend with voicemail at my job.

207
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Oh, wow.

208
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,000
And then I took a different position where I don't have to deal with that crap.

209
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
All right.

210
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:50,000
So anyway, and yeah, I mean, Darth Socko is talking a little personal stuff there, but I think this show because of its length,

211
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
I have often been, I don't want to say criticized.

212
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:59,000
But when I go to these podcasting events where podcasters get together or anything and I talk about,

213
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
yeah, we do Orange On Radio. We run for about three hours every week.

214
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:07,000
People go, really? Really? People listen for three hours?

215
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Yeah.

216
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,000
And I go, well, some do. Not everybody does. Not everybody's got time for that. Some do.

217
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
I was like, shouldn't podcasts be about an hour long?

218
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
And I'm just like, that's not the show we ever did.

219
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Our show was kind of antiquated thinking.

220
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Well, here's the thing. And I understand the whole like evolve or die and that whole thing.

221
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
And, you know, we've tried some things.

222
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Oh, no, we'll make less money.

223
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:35,000
But here's the thing. One, our show didn't like start because of other podcasts.

224
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,000
We were more inspired by like traditional radio at the time.

225
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
And a lot of hosts on traditional radio go for three, four hours.

226
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Yeah.

227
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
So that was not unheard of, really.

228
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
So that's where our roots really are, if you think about it.

229
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,000
And B, now that things have come full circle, we're back on Twitch.

230
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
I mean, think about some of your favorite Twitch streamers.

231
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Are your Twitch streamers going for three or four hours at a time? Is that abnormal?

232
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Not really. A lot. Go for it.

233
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
We got stamina for old folks.

234
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Which is funny because when I do a Twitch stream at like an hour, I'm like, OK, I'm done.

235
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
I want to go do something else now.

236
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
I'm usually like that as well.

237
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,000
But then again, I'm playing DDR, so it's like it's like I want to die.

238
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Yeah. So anyway, and look, hey, I'm glad you're here.

239
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Whether you listen for an hour every week, whether you listen to the whole thing every week,

240
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
if you're here live, if you're here on the podcast, I don't care.

241
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
I'm just I'm grateful for your you being here and your support.

242
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
OK, one other question we're getting and then I swear we're going to get into our kickoff topic,

243
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
which is actually about video games.

244
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,000
So a lot of folks on Twitch are asking and I apologize to podcast listeners for this,

245
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,000
but we have these things sitting on my desk and people are like, what the hell are those?

246
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
These are actually little cakes.

247
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
They're bunt cakes.

248
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
They're little bunt cakes in different flavors.

249
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:51,000
So Dark Soccer threatened last last week that she was going to get us little cakes to celebrate.

250
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
And they look like little spiders from a distance.

251
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
But it's the frosting. It's the way the frosting kind of sits on the cake.

252
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:01,000
I figured with three different cakes and with them being little, we don't have to marry one cake.

253
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
We can enjoy the flavors of all of the cake.

254
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
That's right. I'm very Polly with my cakes.

255
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,000
And I think that's the carrot cake because that's just that's carrot cake is the best.

256
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Shut up.

257
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
But this one's red velvet, so, you know, that's my fave.

258
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
So you get boring old chocolate, Loki.

259
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
All right. Oh, darn.

260
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:21,000
It's basically the same thing that that one's dyed red and doesn't have cream cheese frosting on it.

261
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,000
All right. Anyway, let's get into some gaming news.

262
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:30,000
So the news cycle has slowed down a little bit because we are after E3 week.

263
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
So most of the big companies have put out all their big announcements at this point.

264
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:37,000
So we are going to be in a little bit of a lull for the next couple of weeks before things build up again.

265
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:48,000
However, we got a pretty big gaming bombshell dropped on us this past week with the release of Harry Potter Wizards Unite.

266
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:55,000
This is the new game from Niantic publishing it in collaboration with Portkey Games and I think Warner Brothers San Francisco.

267
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:00,000
This is it's Niantic's newest AR based game.

268
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Niantic, of course, has been in AR gaming for several years.

269
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:08,000
They made a game called Ingress that many Android users kind of noticed was on their phones.

270
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:15,000
And they also made a game called Pokemon Go, which a couple of years ago in that first launch really like that was you.

271
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,000
I you know, again, I think you want to talk about 17 years worth of gaming.

272
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:26,000
I would say the launch of Pokemon Go is easily one of the top 10 things that has happened in gaming in the past 17 years.

273
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Like the way people were out and about walking downtown and old town and stuff like that.

274
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Like I had never seen anything like that in my life.

275
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:41,000
And probably won't again because the popularity of Pokemon Go, it kind of went down a little bit.

276
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:45,000
But it's certainly not dead. I'm going to beat Bobby Black Wolf to the comment in chat.

277
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Pokemon Go is certainly not dead.

278
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:51,000
There's definitely people that still do the raids and do the collection and the events.

279
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Community days still draw a lot of people out. I see a lot of that.

280
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,000
But every day was community day when the game first launched.

281
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:05,000
But now we have Harry Potter, Wizards Unite, which is kind of like, OK, well, let's take some of the things we've learned from these other games we've made.

282
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
And now let's put it into Harry Potter.

283
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:13,000
And so I'm curious how you guys have received Harry Potter, Wizards Unite.

284
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:19,000
And those of you that have played it, because I bet since so many of you tried Pokemon Go, a lot of you probably downloaded it and checked it out.

285
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,000
I'm guessing a lot of you did, but I'm curious what your thoughts are.

286
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Dark Soccer, I'll start with you. Have you had a chance to play?

287
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Yeah, I'm like level nine right now. I haven't been playing like a whole bunch because I've been busy.

288
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Level nine's pretty good, though. That's no slouch.

289
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Yeah, there's things that I like and don't like about it.

290
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:46,000
You know, I hate like the whole wigs and stuff that you can do because they don't quite fit right on like a real person.

291
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Oh, those Snapchat filters?

292
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,000
I don't use Snapchat either because it's stupid.

293
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Ooh, a spleen.

294
00:19:53,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Yeah, so like, I like that it plays a lot differently than Pokemon Go.

295
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Oh God, this is a high threat, too.

296
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:13,000
You know, but like I hate how arbitrary hitting your marks are on the one thing it can be.

297
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Because, I mean, it's like you think that you're doing it perfectly and it's like, oh, you're fair.

298
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Or, man, that one sucked. Marvelous! Perfect! What?

299
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:31,000
So, yeah, there's a few things that I don't like, but for the most part I'm having a lot of fun with it.

300
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
What about you, Loki?

301
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
I don't like it at all.

302
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
But you like Pokemon Go and you like Ingress, right?

303
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
I like Pokemon Go. Ingress is pretty good.

304
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:47,000
This just feels too, I know it's kind of stupid to call it a mobile game, but it feels too mobile game-ish, I guess.

305
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
It's very, like, cheap feeling.

306
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Lots of opportunities to spend gold.

307
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:55,000
And like, I don't really know what I'm supposed to be doing in the game.

308
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:59,000
And I've tried playing it a few times. It's crashed a bunch of times on me.

309
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:05,000
And I just, I don't know, I'm just not really into it at all.

310
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Like, I've tried several different times to play it and I just, I end up closing it out playing Pokemon Go a little bit.

311
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:21,000
I don't know, I thought I would like it, but it's just, I'm not huge into the Harry Potter universe either.

312
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,000
I wasn't huge into the Pokemon either, though, but I don't know.

313
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Maybe I'll learn to like it, but nah, I don't see myself playing this very long.

314
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:35,000
It is a little weird to me how, like, you know, this game launches and then suddenly Niantic is like,

315
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:40,000
to celebrate the launch of Harry Potter Wizards Unite, we're going to do double AP in Ingress.

316
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:48,000
It's 1.975, 9 and 3 quarters, so it's 1.975 times XP, but virtually double AP, which is, that's huge.

317
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Like, to be able to level faster in Ingress is a big deal.

318
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:56,000
So, they do that this weekend and then they're like, oh, in Pokemon Go, all the rewards from Go Fest,

319
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:01,000
like, what is it, like half egg watching, double candy, double XP, like, all these bonuses went into effect.

320
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:06,000
So, it's like, let's celebrate the launch of Harry Potter by making you want to play the other games.

321
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Like, I don't know if I totally get that logic, but okay, whatever.

322
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Yeah, they should have done that, like, next week.

323
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Yeah. So, okay, I play, obviously, like, I love AR games. I've played a lot.

324
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:27,000
I've played a lot besides just the big ones that Niantic's done, like, Jurassic Park, the Walking Dead thing.

325
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Like, I'll play the Minecraft game when that comes out.

326
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
What's that?

327
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
The Minecraft game when that comes out.

328
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Yeah, I'll try the microphone too. You name it, I've probably tried it.

329
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Draconius Go, Garfield Go, I had that installed on my phone for, like, three days.

330
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Munzee, I've played a lot of them.

331
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,000
And I gotta say, Harry Potter, like, it's not perfect.

332
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,000
I'm definitely noticing the, like, way more opportunities to spend gold to do things, right?

333
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Which is the real money, currency essentially, which you get a little bit, you get a little bit of gold,

334
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,000
but it's not a significant amount, for sure, to do everything you want to do.

335
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:03,000
But I think, as far as, like, where it's at day one, I think it's in a way better place than a lot of AR games are on day one.

336
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:07,000
To the point where, I gotta admit, when I first played it, I was like, okay, I'm, like, overwhelmed.

337
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
There's, like, too much ingredients.

338
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Exactly. Like, I don't know what any of that stuff was, and that was very overwhelming.

339
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:17,000
That's kind of where, like, I don't really want to, like, I didn't have time to sit through it.

340
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
That's why you explore the world.

341
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:25,000
But I do think the tutorial, I agree with that in part, and I figured it out by just basically, like, trial and error.

342
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:32,000
And some internet sleuthing, because, you know, I didn't mention yet, but this game has already been out in Australia and New Zealand for about a month.

343
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:38,000
So, some folks down there have already written some guides and things that the rest of us, now that it's launching in more and more countries,

344
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,000
which I think they added, like, 22 more countries over the weekend.

345
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Now that more and more are playing it, we can, like, you know, go to these different resources and look up, you know, what certain things mean.

346
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:58,000
But, I do think the tutorial could have been a little better in that regard, in walking you through some of these things, and the fact that it's just, like, wow, it's really overwhelming.

347
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
I skipped the tutorial.

348
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Wow, I'm surprised you got through it.

349
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Yeah, it, it, I don't know, I didn't think it was that hard at all to figure out.

350
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:11,000
I mean, and I'm not saying that, like, in any kind of, ooh, why did it take you so long?

351
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Yeah.

352
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,000
But, like, I just kind of picked it up and could play right away.

353
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Gotcha.

354
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:37,000
I figured out the battle thing on my own. I figured out, you know, the wand on my own. I figured out mixing, you know, because I read the descriptions of the, of the, uh, potions, and it, you manage your stuff the same way that the old sort of, uh, trades, not trades, but, um, transfers used to go before you could multi-tap on things for Pokemon Go.

355
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:45,000
So it's not, like, it, to me it was pretty intuitive, and on top of that, the, um, your profession system makes me think a lot of, like, Dragon Age.

356
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Hmm.

357
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:56,000
So that made perfect sense to me, that you just have to get the right experience or right items to be able to level up your profession. You have to study, you know.

358
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:05,000
So, to me, it really, really seemed just very intuitive. It really seemed very intuitive to me.

359
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:13,000
I find, though, that I'm having a hard time understanding, like, uh, what should I throw away? What should I keep? You know what I mean?

360
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:22,000
I throw away the, what I do is I look at the ingredient list, and I see the ones that I have just, like, a bajillion ingredients on, and I've kind of gotten an idea for my rarities.

361
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:29,000
So, when I see, oh, I've got 50 things of pus, well, I'm gonna delete, you know, 40 of them.

362
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
That's fair.

363
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:37,000
When I see I have one, you know, wormwood or something, I think, oh, I can make a cup of absinthe. I'm kidding.

364
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Um, I'm like, okay, I need to save more of these. I need to hold on to them.

365
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:51,000
And I look at my ingredient list for my potions, and I'm like, okay, well, this one thing I'm out of is probably the things I'm gonna need to hold on to. So.

366
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Um, I've prepared some lists here before we get into the rest of the news we have this week, which, again, is a little light anyway.

367
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Um, so for those people that kind of get burned out when we talk about mobile games, I will say, you know, this game has not been a slouch.

368
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:12,000
I believe I saw an article today that said the game made $300,000 its first day, which doesn't surprise me at all.

369
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,000
I wasn't seeing the crowds upon crowds of people.

370
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:20,000
But when I went to the park and was walking around, because, you know, you can get a lot of ins and stuff at the park.

371
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:27,000
There were definitely, like, I saw a family, and I saw a couple, and they were absolutely playing Harry Potter because I could kind of overhear them saying, you know, things like,

372
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:32,000
oh, you got to do that greenhouse and, you know, get that, do that with the plan.

373
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:43,000
And I also, yeah, I heard people near me when I was, like, waiting at my son's coding class playing Harry Potter as well, because I could hear their games playing, you know, the Harry Potter theme is very easy to spot.

374
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
That's true. It's very distinct.

375
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,000
I actually haven't played with any sound at all yet, so I can't critique voices or anything.

376
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Gotcha.

377
00:26:49,000 --> 00:27:00,000
But I wanted to go over here some things that I've noticed as a veteran AR gamer, because I've seen a lot of clicky journalist pieces out there that say,

378
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:05,000
Harry Potter, Wizards Unite is just a reskin of Pokemon Go with Harry Potter.

379
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:11,000
And when I read that, when I see that, I can tell right away, you haven't really played those games in depth.

380
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
They some lazy bitches.

381
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Which is, you know, I understand not everybody goes, you know, so there's a lot of casual folks.

382
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:23,000
And certainly at first glance and you look at screenshots, you think, yeah, it does kind of look similar.

383
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
OK, instead of throwing balls, you're tracing things.

384
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
But I actually prepared a list.

385
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Here's five ways that Harry Potter is different from Pokemon Go.

386
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Number one, the battling.

387
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Totally different.

388
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
And in my opinion, far better.

389
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Yeah, it was fun.

390
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Yeah.

391
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,000
Instead of like doing raids, basically, you do these towers.

392
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
You can go to a tower and it doesn't seem like-

393
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Oh, I just meant the one on one battles.

394
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Well, yeah.

395
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Well, you have those two.

396
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Sometimes they spawn in the wild.

397
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Little purple icons will do battles, I find out.

398
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
So sometimes you get them in the wild.

399
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Sometimes you go to the towers.

400
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
And I point here because there's one at the park over here.

401
00:27:54,000 --> 00:28:00,000
You go there and I haven't quite figured out, like, it doesn't seem like the where the tower is is very important.

402
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,000
It's just what level you do in the tower and what stone you give it.

403
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:10,000
So the stone seems like a multiplier and the level you're doing seems like some type of reward.

404
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
I have not figured all that out yet.

405
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,000
I'm waiting for the min-maxer people to determine all that.

406
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:18,000
But when you actually do the fighting in Pokemon Go, it's this.

407
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap.

408
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Yeah, which is annoying.

409
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
That's how you fight in Pokemon Go.

410
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Which, you know, for where mobile AR games were at two years ago, that's what they did.

411
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
And it was- it's fine at the time.

412
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,000
But this one is definitely evolved.

413
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Like, you know, you have the little reticle, which is for aiming your wand.

414
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
And it's not just where you tap on the screen.

415
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
And this took me a minute to figure out.

416
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:41,000
It's actually- you use like the bottom center part of your screen.

417
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:45,000
And that is actually representative of your entire screen because it's where you're aiming your wand.

418
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:48,000
So just play around in the bottom part and you'll notice how your reticle goes around.

419
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:52,000
So you have to aim your reticle and hold it over a certain point because sometimes the monster moves.

420
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
So you have to kind of move your finger to go to the monster.

421
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:58,000
And then once it's connected for enough time, you draw a pattern with it that will come up on the screen.

422
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
It's very interactive.

423
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Yeah, then you have to defend and all this stuff.

424
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:06,000
So the battling, I think, is far more interesting than- and I bet in AR it's really cool.

425
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:11,000
But the very first thing I did was turn off AR mode because I know what a battery sync that is.

426
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
So I turn off the AR stuff.

427
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Number two, I think there's more meta games at the beginning of the game.

428
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Remember when Pokémon Go, I mean, well, and then Pokémon Go, especially when it started, day one,

429
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,000
there wasn't a lot to do but catch Pokémon, which was fine.

430
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
I mean, everybody loves Pokémon, right?

431
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:32,000
But now in this, you have ingredient collecting, you have potion brewing, you have the greenhouse stuff.

432
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:38,000
You have- there's like a lot of other things to do that aren't necessarily even there in Pokémon Go yet.

433
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Number three, there are more points of interest in Harry Potter Wizards Unite

434
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:48,000
because every Ingress portal crossed over into Harry Potter Wizards Unite.

435
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,000
So you're probably seeing things you didn't see in Pokémon Go and the reason why-

436
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
But the Starbucks didn't.

437
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Oh, yeah, that's a good point.

438
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:59,000
The sponsored stuff from Pokémon Go didn't directly come over.

439
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:02,000
So your sprints and your Starbucks are not in Pokémon Go.

440
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:10,000
But for example, in Pokémon Go, where those gyms are, where there's like Starbucks near me,

441
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
there's actually a portal that got suppressed from Ingress.

442
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
So it's in Harry Potter.

443
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
So you see the portal is in Harry Potter instead.

444
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
So there are more points of interest.

445
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
But actually, since we're talking about sponsored locations,

446
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:25,000
I don't know what they did in Harry Potter, but there are a ton of sponsored locations.

447
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,000
They're all at malls.

448
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Really? I haven't been to any malls yet.

449
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Yes. I went to the Vacaville outlets.

450
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,000
I was in Berkeley, ironically, for an Ingress thing over the weekend.

451
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:40,000
And I stopped at the Vacaville outlets on the way home because my fat ass wanted jelly beans.

452
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:44,000
So I went to the outlet that was there and I wanted to look at clothes too.

453
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,000
So I stopped there and I brought up Harry Potter and I was like,

454
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,000
because I know in Ingress, I'm like, there's three portals here.

455
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
There's like that signboard and like two other things.

456
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:56,000
I bring up Harry Potter Wizards Unite and I'm like, what the hell?

457
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
There's like a ton of stuff here.

458
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:03,000
And I click on it and like one of them says near Taco Bell and it's sponsored.

459
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:08,000
And the picture is a signboard that in fact is near Taco Bell.

460
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
And there was other stuff like that too.

461
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:14,000
It was like Far East Starbucks was there.

462
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,000
So it's like the malls submitted all these locations.

463
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
I hear Arden Fair has a ton of stuff like that too.

464
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
So that's another one of our local malls.

465
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:25,000
So, yeah, I don't know. It's weird.

466
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:29,000
Like a ton of sponsored stuff crossed over.

467
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
So, yeah.

468
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:35,000
Number four, Prestiging is already built into the game.

469
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:39,000
So as somebody who's hit maximum level in Pokémon GO,

470
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:43,000
there's not a lot to do after that point except try to build the Pokédex

471
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:46,000
and collect shinies and I guess work on friendship levels.

472
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,000
I mean, this needs to do.

473
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
But as far as experience goes, that's really it.

474
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,000
Ingress put in a Prestiging.

475
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
They call it Recursing.

476
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,000
But they put in something where you can kind of go back and start over,

477
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
which I don't think they did a great job of it

478
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:03,000
because they were supposed to give us a power that they haven't given us yet for Recursing.

479
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Oops, we forgot.

480
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Well, I think it's because they're having to run the Redacted and Prime still.

481
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
But that's a whole other game and a set of issues.

482
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:14,000
But Harry Potter actually already has Prestiging built in, sort of.

483
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Now the max level in Harry Potter Wizards Unite is 60, is what I'm hearing.

484
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:22,000
But you know how you're filling up those pages with stickers and stuff?

485
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
And you might be wondering, what happens when I fill up a page?

486
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:31,000
You can Prestige the page and start over and you'll get the XP bonuses reset

487
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
so you can collect XP bonuses again from the pages.

488
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:39,000
And my understanding is that the pages will have a permanent bronze, silver, or gold frame around them

489
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
depending on how many times you Prestiged it.

490
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,000
So there's a little more to do there.

491
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,000
And then, yeah.

492
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
I'm going to have cake.

493
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,000
You're going to have some cake. Go for it.

494
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,000
You earned cake. Get a cake.

495
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Number five, the classes and the skill trees.

496
00:32:54,000 --> 00:33:00,000
That's kind of unheard of in the Pokemon Go, is that you actually get to pick what class you want to be.

497
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
There's three classes.

498
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:05,000
There's the Aurora, something like that.

499
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
Auror, which is the DPS.

500
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:10,000
There's the Magizoologist.

501
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,000
Magizoologist.

502
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,000
Magizoologist.

503
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
Why would you go away and get cake when I need you, Darcyra?

504
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:19,000
The Magizoologist, which is, I guess, part tanky, part heal-y.

505
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
And then Professor, that's the easy one.

506
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:24,000
That's the one that I'm playing, which I think is like a support class type of thing.

507
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:28,000
And so apparently it actually matters when you go into some of these fortress battles.

508
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:34,000
You can play with other people and as a professor, I can actually put heals on somebody while they're battling somebody else.

509
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:39,000
And then you actually have a skill tree that you build out using pages that you collect from doing battles and things like that.

510
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
So it's kind of neat.

511
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:46,000
It's a lot more in-depth than we've seen from your typical Niantic game so far.

512
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
So, yeah.

513
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
There you go.

514
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:55,000
So those are five ways that Harry Potter Wizards Unite is different from Pokémon Go.

515
00:33:55,000 --> 00:34:03,000
And that I am really not seeing in a lot of those articles that are out there because I bet those people played it for an hour and then went to go write their articles.

516
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
So, just saying.

517
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,000
Anyway.

518
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
And you kind of perked up at some of that stuff I was saying.

519
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Did some of that make you maybe want to go check it out again?

520
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Or nah, you're already over it.

521
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,000
We'll see.

522
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:19,000
Now, I'm not going to be like the game's biggest stand or the game's biggest offender.

523
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
I also have a list of four so far.

524
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,000
I couldn't think of them all.

525
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:27,000
But I have a list of four ways that this game needs to improve ASAP.

526
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
My four items for how this game needs to improve.

527
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:33,000
Number one, right now there's really no point to the friends list.

528
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:38,000
I see all these posts on Facebook and Twitter that are like, add me, add me, add me.

529
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,000
And right now there's really no reason to do it.

530
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:45,000
The professor battling, I understand, or I'm sorry, professor battling.

531
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:52,000
The tower battling may have something there where like having the people on your friends list is kind of helpful and some of that stuff.

532
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,000
But there's no gift sending.

533
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Somebody joked that maybe they'll have owls that you can send out or something.

534
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
Maybe that'll be a thing later on.

535
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,000
But right now there's no gift sending.

536
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
There's nothing like that.

537
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:10,000
So there's no reason to have friends and there's especially no reason to have friends long distance.

538
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:16,000
So sorry I haven't given out my friend code on Twitter or anything like that.

539
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:21,000
But right now there's no reason to have friends that are far away in the game right now.

540
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
There's no reason to unite with these wizards.

541
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,000
No.

542
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
But hopefully there will be.

543
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:30,000
Bobby Blackwell says there is no reason to have friends.

544
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,000
I said it. Print it. Put it on the back of the box.

545
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Isn't that what I just said?

546
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
Yeah. It is.

547
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,000
All right. Number two. Thank you.

548
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
I like how she just knows to give me red velvet.

549
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Number two in the airing of Grievances.

550
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:48,000
Adventure Sync needs to be in this game like right now.

551
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:54,000
Because it's a battery drain to walk those little port keys around.

552
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
Which I didn't even talk about.

553
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,000
That's a sixth way that this is very different than Pokemon Go.

554
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:02,000
Those port keys, yeah they're kind of like eggs superficially.

555
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,000
Is that you put the key and you know you walk a certain distance.

556
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:13,000
But I would bet you any article that says port keys are the equivalent to eggs in Pokemon Go didn't hatch one.

557
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
They didn't walk two kilometers yet.

558
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Because guess what?

559
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,000
They don't just hatch and poof you have a new picture.

560
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:23,000
No. You have to go in there and you do it and then you kind of end up in like a forced AR thing.

561
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
But like not necessarily in your own room.

562
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Or VR. Not AR.

563
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
Yeah. I don't even know if I call it. Maybe.

564
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
Dark Sakura says more VR than AR. I guess.

565
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
AR is an augmented reality.

566
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
Okay. You need to say this on a mic Dark Sakura.

567
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,000
Come back.

568
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
Like I'm not going to relay everything.

569
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:40,000
So AR is augmented reality.

570
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,000
Where it is your real life area with augmenting to it.

571
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
VR is virtual reality.

572
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:49,000
So these little houses that you go to with your port key are virtual spaces.

573
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
So it is VR.

574
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
Okay. Put the knife down when you're talking to me though.

575
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,000
Just kidding.

576
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Honestly it's a little bit of both because it does start AR.

577
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
You do see your own world and you tap on it.

578
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,000
It's a little mix of both.

579
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
That's really where I got to leave it at.

580
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:06,000
But you kind of go in this thing and you like have to look around using your phone as a way to look.

581
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
And you want to tap all these little lights.

582
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
It's like a Where's Waldo thing.

583
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
It's not just like a hatching thing.

584
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
So it's something that's different.

585
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,000
But like it's really ridiculous that you have to have your game open while you walk ten kilometers.

586
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
Like that's not going to happen.

587
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
And the thing while you're driving.

588
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
You know the slow driving under 20 miles an hour.

589
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
That doesn't work anymore either.

590
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
I was going ten and it knew.

591
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
What if I was on my bike?

592
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
But your character does fly a broom which I think is really cute.

593
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Bobby Blackwell says Microsoft's term is mixed reality.

594
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
I think that's a good way to put it.

595
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
Mixed reality.

596
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
All right.

597
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:44,000
Why No Record in chat says it takes some real restraint to actually slice those little cakes.

598
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
I just grab a fork.

599
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,000
Dark soccer wants to make sure everybody gets a piece of what they want.

600
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:53,000
I also wanted to make sure that if people wanted to try the other cakes.

601
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
Yeah.

602
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,000
That there's a little bit you can have a small piece of it.

603
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,000
That's good. I like that.

604
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
Carrot cake is my favorite.

605
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
All right.

606
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
Let's see. Number three.

607
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
My third grievance out of four.

608
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:06,000
The greenhouse mechanic is too weird and it's broken.

609
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:10,000
You go in there and you can plant a seed and water it.

610
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,000
And then other people can come by and improve it.

611
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:17,000
Like you go to a greenhouse, you plant something is like this is going to hatch in seven hours.

612
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:20,000
Great. I'm not going to hang out here for seven hours and wait for it to hatch.

613
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,000
So unless you like live by one.

614
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Work has a greenhouse and it had my same plant from the one I planted by my house.

615
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,000
Interesting.

616
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
So I don't think it carries over like that. I think that's just luck.

617
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
I think that's a coincidence.

618
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:38,000
No, no, no, no. It was the plant had the same timer and everything.

619
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:42,000
So I think it remembers that you planted one at a greenhouse and it doesn't matter which one you go to.

620
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:47,000
Interesting. OK, if that's true, then I would like them to be able to explain that because I was not getting that impression at all.

621
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:52,000
But I've been walking around as I've been playing Ingress for the double AP, getting a lot of like stops and greenhouses.

622
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,000
So I probably didn't get that, I guess. Anyway.

623
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:58,000
So, yeah, I think they just need to refine it.

624
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:05,000
I think if it does really work the way Darksire is describing, I guess it's a little better that it would move to you wherever greenhouse you're at.

625
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:08,000
But like, I'm not going to not everybody lives on a greenhouse.

626
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,000
I see a lot of you like, oh, the closest thing you're me is on a greenhouse.

627
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:15,000
That's great. But you have to realize these games get a lot of shit in rural areas as it is.

628
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:18,000
So they need to do something a little better, I think, with that.

629
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:25,000
I actually the little park by my neighbor has has neighborhood has one of each seven in a greenhouse and a tower.

630
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:31,000
If you go I don't want to say where I live, but if you go down to the park, not the one right here, but the other one that's bigger, that's further down.

631
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:36,000
There's like five in two fortresses. There's like tons of stuff.

632
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:42,000
So anyway, lastly, number four, there is way not enough space to store stuff.

633
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,000
Yes, I need more indication what to keep in toss.

634
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:48,000
And they're using it as a way to sell extra space. And it's not there.

635
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,000
They're really gouging you for that. What is this? No man's sky.

636
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
It's silly. Early No Man's Sky.

637
00:39:53,000 --> 00:40:00,000
Now, I suppose a fifth thing I could be critical about is the spell energy, but I will give Niantic and the team Portkey and all that.

638
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:04,000
I will give them props because they address the spell energy thing already.

639
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:09,000
They said, OK, we hear you guys on the spell energy thing. So you're going to start with more spell energy.

640
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:12,000
There's a gift right now in the store for 50 free spell energy.

641
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:16,000
If you haven't got that yet, go to the store and scroll down to the bottom.

642
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:20,000
It's there. You get 50 free spell energy right now. We're going to make ends give more energy.

643
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:26,000
All greenhouses will give energy. So like they've already like tried to address it. Is it perfect?

644
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:30,000
No. But am I really encouraged that it took 48 hours for them to address it?

645
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:38,000
Yes, because that's not the Niantic I know. So I don't know if Portkey's doing the management on that or what, but that's pretty outstanding.

646
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:43,000
So, yeah. So I know I talked a lot in depth about that, but I think there's a lot with this game.

647
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:46,000
And it is kind of the biggest thing in gaming this week since E3 is over.

648
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:50,000
So, yeah. Anything else you guys want to say on Harry Potter, Wizards Unite?

649
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:53,000
I'm just really enjoying the simplicity of it.

650
00:40:53,000 --> 00:41:01,000
Yeah. I mean, I suppose it could motivate me to get back out and walk, but it's 100 degrees. So no.

651
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:07,000
Yeah. It's hard to juggle the different games because one of my Ingress pals is like, so you're going to play three games now?

652
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:15,000
And I'm like, honestly, Pokemon goes on the back burner until I have reason to play it like community days or things like that.

653
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:21,000
I was already, which I need to get shinies from you anyway, but I was already playing Pokemon Go.

654
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:27,000
I was playing idle pouring. I still play idle pouring. I'm playing Animal Crossing Pocket Camp.

655
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:32,000
And now I'm playing this. It was some Ingress thrown in for, you know, lulz.

656
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:39,000
Yeah. SG100Matt in our chat at Twitch TV slash VOG Network says the amount of data it uses is keeping me from playing it on Wi-Fi for now.

657
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:43,000
Niantic knows that it uses a bunch of data, but I'm sure it'll get better after updates.

658
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:50,000
Well, they have, there's like guides online on how to save the data. You can turn off downloading over wireless networks.

659
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:56,000
And then you can actually set an option to download all the content to save on some of that.

660
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:00,000
Yeah, I actually did that, even though that's going to eat up like three and a half gigs on your phone.

661
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:07,000
I downloaded all the content and, but I also, I am fortunate where I have unlimited internet on my cell phone.

662
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:11,000
And these AR games are a big reason why. So it's not a concern for me.

663
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:15,000
However, your concern is completely valid because I know there are a lot of people on metered plans.

664
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:22,000
And so Niantic kind of needs to be reasonable about that if they want people to play that game a lot.

665
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:29,000
So figure out how to fucking build your mobile game plans. Cause it's like, it's ridiculous that my phone should be set on fire and crash half the time.

666
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:36,000
Like, like this right here, this I'm sure is, oh, there it goes. It was like glitching the hell out. It already crashed once.

667
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,000
Yeah. Wow.

668
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:43,000
Mine got really hot. I was going to do a break segment tonight to talk about Wizards Unite.

669
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:47,000
But when I tried to go out in the sun and walk and record, my phone was like, nope, not doing it.

670
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:55,000
It was like getting so jittery slow, like the frame rate. And I have an iPhone 10. Like I don't, you know, it's not exactly an old phone.

671
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:58,000
So yeah, there you go.

672
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:03,000
YYR in chat says, wait, you have a bandwidth cap on your house internet, but none on your mobile phone?

673
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:12,000
Correct. I have a bandwidth cap from Comcast on my house internet, one terabyte, but not on my mobile phone from AT&T Unlimited, whatever.

674
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:16,000
Cause all the carriers got in an unlimited war not that long ago.

675
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:19,000
Cause they just throttle your service once you get so many.

676
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:24,000
The cable companies ought to just go into the unlimited space. I'm sure we'd all love that.

677
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:31,000
I, this gets off topic a lot, but I think a big reason the cable companies kind of did the data limits to begin with was piracy.

678
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:34,000
I think piracy was a huge reason they did this in the first place.

679
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:41,000
But now that we're getting in this, I think there's a lot less piracy than there used to be.

680
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
I'm not saying it's not there. I'm not naive.

681
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:49,000
But I think there's a lot less than there used to be because of things like Spotify, Apple Music, etc.

682
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:54,000
Less people use things like Napster or downloading MP3s and those types of archives.

683
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:57,000
And YouTube, you can listen to a lot of music on there.

684
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:02,000
And then when it comes to TV shows, now because of Netflix and Hulu and that stuff, less people download them.

685
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:07,000
Again, I'm not naive. Yes, people do download things like Game of Thrones and stuff because people get sick of the whole,

686
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:10,000
I'm not going to pay $10 for this, $10 for that, $10 for this.

687
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:19,000
So, but I would say that people are probably legitimizing some of it and maybe pirating the rest that isn't on their preferred service.

688
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:23,000
But anyway, I'm getting into a digression a little bit there.

689
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:30,000
But, yeah. So anyway, Act Def says, even then you may have unlimited, but you don't have unthrottled internet.

690
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:35,000
I got to admit, I've not really had a problem. If they throttle me, I don't really notice.

691
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:40,000
So, because I'm not doing anything that big on data. I'm just playing stupid games.

692
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
I'm not trying to download big things very often.

693
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:45,000
And I have the rollover data, so I never run out.

694
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
Yeah. Oh, that's nice. That's really nice.

695
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:50,000
All right. So anyway, that's plenty on Harry Potter Wizards Unite.

696
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:54,000
I know we talked at length about that, but again, it is kind of the big thing going on in gaming this week.

697
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:59,000
Let's talk about our gaming week outside of that. What other types of things have we been doing this week?

698
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:02,000
So, Dark Soccer, how was your gaming week outside of Harry Potter?

699
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
Bloodstained.

700
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:09,000
Oh, yeah. I haven't gotten to play it yet because my Kickstarter code is on the Switch.

701
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:13,000
So, I have to wait another week. So, please tell me all about it.

702
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:18,000
Oh, my God. It's great. It is beautiful. The music is beautiful.

703
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:22,000
The game is great. Even the voice acting, because Dan's playing it in English.

704
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:26,000
The voice acting is good. The scenery is amazing.

705
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:30,000
I'm really hoping that Boundary Break, one of the channels I watch on YouTube,

706
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:33,000
does a behind the scenes Boundary Break stuff.

707
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:36,000
You know, show what's behind those background scenes.

708
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:41,000
It feels like Symphony of the Night. It really does.

709
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:44,000
It seems a little bit harder, though.

710
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:50,000
But the controls are pretty responsive.

711
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:55,000
You get twists and turns in some of the characters.

712
00:45:55,000 --> 00:46:00,000
The little universe that was built up for it is pretty damn good.

713
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:05,000
I mean, it's good when you can go into a game and it already has lore behind it.

714
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:08,000
And then voice actors.

715
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:13,000
Zangetsu is voiced by David Hayter.

716
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:17,000
So, we've been making solid snake jokes, of course.

717
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:23,000
And then there's a character by the name of O.D., who's a librarian.

718
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:28,000
It's Alucard's voice actor.

719
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:32,000
So, we've been calling him Alucard the whole time.

720
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:36,000
And then there's even some of the nods to Symphony.

721
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:41,000
Like, you can sit in the chairs and your fairy familiar will sit on you.

722
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:46,000
You can get Shovel Knight as a shard power.

723
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:49,000
You can get Shovel Knight's armor and turn into Shovel Knight.

724
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:53,000
And it is Shovel Knight licensed.

725
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:56,000
You can...

726
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:59,000
I'm just trying to think of some of the other little neat things.

727
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
You've got your bell tower you can jump through.

728
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:04,000
You've got clock towers. You've got train rides.

729
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:07,000
You've got just all kinds of amazing things.

730
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
And it really is perfect.

731
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
And there's a scene that I put up on my Facebook.

732
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:14,000
I was just about to ask this. What was that thing with the piano that you had on Facebook?

733
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:19,000
So, there's a garden that you can go into that just has a piano sitting under a canopy.

734
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:25,000
And if you do it without the fairy familiar, then you just play the song.

735
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:28,000
But if the fairy familiar is with you, she'll sing it.

736
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:31,000
And that's pretty cool.

737
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:34,000
I'm just trying to think of some other neat things in there too.

738
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
You can...

739
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:42,000
One thing that actually just me being an art nerd, they talk about photography.

740
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
And like, what's a photograph?

741
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:48,000
And so one of the characters explains how daguerreotypes work.

742
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:52,000
And it's absolutely, absolutely amazing.

743
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
Oh, and one other thing is like when you, you know,

744
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:57,000
eventually when you get a certain power,

745
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:01,000
you can do the thing where you can knock OD's chair into the air,

746
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
like you could with the shopkeeper.

747
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
And just keep bouncing it up and down and up and down.

748
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:08,000
And he gives you stuff just like the shopkeeper did.

749
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:12,000
So, some of the powers are really, really crazy.

750
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:16,000
And I don't want to spoil it because Dan and I were doing blind plays through it.

751
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:19,000
Yeah, don't ruin it for me because I want to experience it next week.

752
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:26,000
But eventually though, you need to think outside of your present box.

753
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:31,000
But it really just kind of takes you on some twists.

754
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
There's hidden stuff in places.

755
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:36,000
Just explore everything. Take the ferry with you.

756
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,000
Awesome.

757
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:40,000
So I'm excited to try it myself.

758
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:43,000
So you give it your seal of approval because I know a lot of people were worried about it.

759
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:46,000
Like some of the early versions that came out kind of didn't run good.

760
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:50,000
Oh, I didn't see any issues.

761
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:53,000
I mean, some of the bosses are fucking hard as balls.

762
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
I mean, and we're at the end of the game.

763
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,000
Oh, wow.

764
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
Lots of hidden stuff though.

765
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:03,000
Lots of hidden areas to find filling in your map.

766
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:06,000
You know, it's got all the great stuff that Symphony of the Night did.

767
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:09,000
And on top of that, it's charming in its own right.

768
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
Not just because of nostalgia.

769
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:16,000
If Symphony of the Night had never existed and this just came out, this would be what Symphony of the Night was.

770
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,000
Does that make sense?

771
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:18,000
Yeah, no, I do.

772
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
In terms of the love behind it and popularity.

773
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:23,000
It doesn't need a Castlevania name behind it.

774
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
It is standalone.

775
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:26,000
Great.

776
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:29,000
And then, of course, my usual other games on my phone.

777
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:30,000
All right.

778
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
Oh, and we just got a new pinball.

779
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,000
Oh, you got a new pinball?

780
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:36,000
You know what I've been wanting for a long fucking time?

781
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
There's a lot. Big Bang Bar.

782
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,000
Fuck.

783
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
We have a Black Rose.

784
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:42,000
Oh, okay.

785
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:46,000
So now we have like three done by the same guys.

786
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:49,000
So we're like, who are we gonna sell one?

787
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:52,000
And Dan's like, I'm not getting rid of my creature from the Black Lagoon.

788
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,000
I'm like, damn.

789
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:56,000
But he's like, do you want to lend out World Cup soccer to a friend of mine?

790
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,000
No.

791
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:58,000
Why not?

792
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,000
Because I said no.

793
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:00,000
It was literally that.

794
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
Well, that's not a reason.

795
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,000
Yeah, no is a reason.

796
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
No, because I don't want to is a reason.

797
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:09,000
So now we have to find a place to put Black Rose.

798
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,000
All right.

799
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:14,000
He can lend out Shadow or something else or Indiana Jones.

800
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
Yeah, we got an Indiana Jones as well.

801
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,000
Oh, my gosh.

802
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:18,000
It's ever changing at your place.

803
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
Your place is an arcade.

804
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,000
It's great.

805
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:22,000
So that's it.

806
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,000
All right.

807
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:24,000
Let's go to Loki.

808
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,000
How was your gaming week, Loki?

809
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:26,000
I didn't play very much this week.

810
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:29,000
It's been stressful, but I did play just mobile stuff.

811
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
So a little bit of Pokemon Go.

812
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:36,000
I did open up Ingress because I was checking to see if the portal that I submitted actually

813
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,000
got accepted.

814
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:43,000
Ironically enough, not the location I wanted submitted, but the yogurt place next door.

815
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:48,000
There's a mural on the wall of yogurt, frozen yogurt, and that got accepted as a portal.

816
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
So but it hasn't been rejected yet, so there's still a chance.

817
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:53,000
But it is awfully close to where that would be.

818
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:56,000
So I'm skeptical that they're going to accept it.

819
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:01,000
I just had my first submission in Prime go through because you can submit in Prime now.

820
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:04,000
And when you submit in Prime, you can do two pictures.

821
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:07,000
You can put justification, which you can't do in the original.

822
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
So it helps it in getting through OPR.

823
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
So I had my first one get accepted, but it only took a week.

824
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:16,000
But it was like a really obviously it was an amphitheater at a park that somehow was not a portal.

825
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
So it was a very obvious yes candidate.

826
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
I doubt anybody voted no.

827
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:21,000
It's fine.

828
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:22,000
It could take a while.

829
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
So there's that.

830
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
And then what else?

831
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
I just worked a little bit on programming.

832
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:31,000
And yeah, that's about it.

833
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
Not too much.

834
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:34,000
All right.

835
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,000
My gaming week.

836
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
A lot of the similar types of stuff.

837
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,000
Things like Diablo 3.

838
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,000
Still cutting away at that.

839
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:42,000
And then Final Fantasy XIV gearing up for the expansion.

840
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:45,000
I did play more of the Castlevania collection this week.

841
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:48,000
And I did something I have never done before.

842
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
And I'm very excited about it.

843
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:53,000
Well, I beat Castlevania 1, which I've never done before.

844
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
Well, before you give me those kudos, Dark Soccer.

845
00:51:55,000 --> 00:52:01,000
The reason why is because they actually patched the Castlevania collection this week with the Japanese versions of the game.

846
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:08,000
So instead of the Famicom disk version replacing Castlevania 1, they took the cartridge from 1993.

847
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:13,000
Because they released on cartridge when they added easy mode.

848
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
And I beat it with easy mode.

849
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:19,000
So not quite maybe deserving of all those kudos.

850
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:22,000
But hey, I got to see that ending I've never seen.

851
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
Does it play with the disk music, though?

852
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,000
Unfortunately, no.

853
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:26,000
Because it's cartridge.

854
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:27,000
Because the disk music was good.

855
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:32,000
Yeah, but what is really cool about Castlevania, the fact that they added the Japanese stuff,

856
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:36,000
is that Castlevania 3 does use the disk version.

857
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
And you get the disk music.

858
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:43,000
And I got to tell you, if you have Castlevania collection, go play Castlevania 3.

859
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:55,000
And that is probably the best game that shows you how having an additional sound channel on the Famicom disk system really elevated the 8-bit songs.

860
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:56,000
So yeah, check that out.

861
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
That's really all I have to say with that.

862
00:52:58,000 --> 00:52:59,000
So.

863
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:02,000
Tigerclaw on chat says, Rob beat Castlevania 1.

864
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:05,000
Did he use any of those speedrunning strats to beat the levels?

865
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
No, I didn't.

866
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
It felt like some of them I was going through pretty quick.

867
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
But again, I was on easy mode.

868
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:15,000
And actually, I remember in one part, I tried to do the thing I remember in the second level.

869
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:21,000
You can like jump and get hit by a Medusa head and it knocks you up on the platform.

870
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
So you can actually skip this whole section.

871
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
But like, it wouldn't work.

872
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:30,000
And I don't know if I think they might have eliminated the knockback in easy mode, I think is why.

873
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
So it didn't work.

874
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:36,000
Because I remember like, I was thinking, weren't these mobs supposed to do a knockback and none of them were doing it.

875
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:40,000
So you keep the doubles and triples that you get.

876
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
You don't lose them when you change your weapon.

877
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
And you lose way less health.

878
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:47,000
So it makes it like, it makes it so much easier to get through the game.

879
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
So, yeah.

880
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
Let's see.

881
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:56,000
Bob Coffee in chat says, Japanese Castlevania 3 also has a lot more reasonable difficulty.

882
00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:00,000
American version is way, way harder, way harsher damage.

883
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,000
So.

884
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:05,000
And Orange Wright's confirming what I thought where Castlevania easy mode didn't seem to have the knockback.

885
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:10,000
So anyway, if you have the Castlevania collection, just a heads up, it got patched with that Japanese patch.

886
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:13,000
And I think I heard the Arcade Collection got it too.

887
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:16,000
And I would imagine Contra Collection must have it.

888
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
If not, it's getting it real soon, I'm sure.

889
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
So, there is that.

890
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,000
Okay.

891
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
And that was my gaming week.

892
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:26,000
So, let's move on. We're going to get into some gaming news.

893
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
There's been a little bit going on throughout the gaming world.

894
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:34,000
Even if E3 was last week and we got all the big headlines then, we have a few things to talk about tonight.

895
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:42,000
So, this is the week in history in which EA decided to try to redefine definitions of what a loot box is.

896
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
And it's just ridiculous.

897
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:50,000
So, there was this whole UK Parliament's Digital Culture, Media and Sports Committee.

898
00:54:50,000 --> 00:55:01,000
Where Carrie Hopkins of EA had made some statements when they were asking them whether they considered loot boxes to be an ethical feature.

899
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:05,000
And she stated, we don't call them loot boxes.

900
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:11,000
Instead, EA refers to them as surprise mechanics.

901
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
It's like, you know, a blind...

902
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
Surprise! Got your wallet.

903
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:24,000
Well, they're saying it's like a blind bags toy thing that you would get in the store where you don't know which toy you're going to get.

904
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:27,000
Sorry, that doesn't really cut it.

905
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
There's a major difference between those.

906
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:39,000
One, loot boxes are digital purchases which the value of what's inside them can greatly differ from what you're getting.

907
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:49,000
And it's not like where, especially with a lot of the EA games, like sports games and stuff, where there's a new game every year that stuff doesn't carry over.

908
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
So, you're basically getting it for a year.

909
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:57,000
Whereas, like if I bought a blind bag toy, like say for example, we tend to buy some of these Lego minifigure blind bags.

910
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:01,000
Yeah, you don't know what you're going to get in there, but it's always a Lego minifigure.

911
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:06,000
So, you're always getting something and that minifigure is not going to disappear in a year.

912
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:09,000
Well, I can think of the biggest difference is that...

913
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:14,000
Okay, so what about when I used to buy Magic the Gathering cards, which I'm sure some of you still do.

914
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:17,000
You might get something of a very high, great value in there.

915
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:21,000
And you know generally you're going to get so many land cards, but you might get something really good in there, right?

916
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:24,000
But here's the big, big difference between Magic the Gathering cards and loot boxes.

917
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:28,000
If I get cards I don't necessarily want, I can trade them and give them to somebody else.

918
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:33,000
I can trade. I can, you know, it's kind of like a currency I can use and trade with other people.

919
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:36,000
And that was the whole point of a trading card game.

920
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:39,000
But you can't really, and it's just like your blind boxes.

921
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:42,000
If you don't get what you want, you trade with somebody else to get the one you want.

922
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:43,000
Exactly.

923
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:44,000
You can't do that in loot box games.

924
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:48,000
And you can't just call it something else and say,

925
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:53,000
See? We're not illegal. Like, you know, I didn't murder that person.

926
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:57,000
I just... ate it in his early death.

927
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:01,000
You know, it's like, you can't just call it something else and say,

928
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:04,000
See? Can't get us now. They're not loot boxes.

929
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:08,000
And ironically enough, you know, was it, not even a week or so ago,

930
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:11,000
when they have the whole Star Wars thing and they're talking about their brand new Star Wars.

931
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,000
It's not going to have loot boxes in it.

932
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
So does that mean there are going to be loot boxes in it?

933
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,000
Because you're not calling them loot boxes anymore.

934
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
It's going to have surprise. Surprise!

935
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:20,000
You're getting fucked again.

936
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:24,000
Surprise! It's a mechanic in which we're going to demand money from you.

937
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
I didn't murder them, Loki.

938
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:29,000
I put surprise poison in their drink.

939
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:33,000
But it wasn't murder. It was a surprise.

940
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:34,000
Right?

941
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:40,000
Their body got riddled with surprise projectiles.

942
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,000
It's stupid. It's stupid.

943
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:48,000
It's stupid and it's funny is, like, even the people at, you know, that hearing.

944
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:50,000
They fucking saw right through it.

945
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:53,000
And it's just like, I don't know what they thought that they were going to do.

946
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
Like, pull one over on them.

947
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,000
Like, all of a sudden they're going to be like,

948
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,000
You know, we never thought about it like that.

949
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:02,000
I guess this is completely legal. Bye bye.

950
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
I mean, like, what the fuck did you think was going to happen?

951
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:08,000
The other thing with those, I was going to say on those, like, Happy Meal toys and stuff,

952
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
where you don't know, like, which toy you're going to get.

953
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:15,000
Like, actually, if you're just really nice to the employees and say please and thank you

954
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:19,000
and act like a nice person and not like, you know, an asshole at customer service and all that,

955
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
like, usually you can just ask really nicely,

956
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:25,000
Is there any way you could get one with the, you know, bunny beanie baby or whatever?

957
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,000
Because that's the one my kid doesn't have.

958
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:30,000
And they'll do it, like, if they can.

959
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:33,000
I guess back in the day, maybe I'm thinking a long time ago

960
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,000
when I had a bunch of friends that worked at McDonald's.

961
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,000
Like, they would, like, if I wanted something, I would get it.

962
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,000
They would get it for me, you know?

963
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:43,000
But, like, I don't know, maybe today they're harder to do that stuff with.

964
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:46,000
To be fair, like, a lot of times they can pull strings, you know?

965
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:50,000
To be fair, in this case with EA's stuff, on some of the Ultimate Steam stuff,

966
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:53,000
you can actually trade those cards that you get in there,

967
00:58:53,000 --> 00:59:03,000
but they do, like, I mean, there's, they have patents for, like, predatory, like, schemes

968
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:09,000
to basically try to lure you into, you know, making more purchases.

969
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:13,000
They've got, like, Activision has some of these stuff that they've patented.

970
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:16,000
They have whole, like, firms that are dedicated to this stuff.

971
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:20,000
You can't tell me, and the fact, also, there's people that have said, like,

972
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:26,000
listen, I've dropped, like, $20,000 because I just can't stop buying these things.

973
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:30,000
I'm addicted to it, like, you know, gambling, and they're just ignoring all that stuff.

974
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
And, like, I get it.

975
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:33,000
Yay, capitalism.

976
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:37,000
It's, but here's the thing, it's never gonna end until people stop buying them,

977
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:43,000
and that's the problem. You're never gonna have that happen if people keep, you know, putting money into it.

978
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,000
So, stop it, people.

979
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,000
Do you have another comment on this, StarSucker?

980
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:48,000
No, just yay capitalism.

981
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
Oh, yeah, well, that's part of it.

982
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
Let's see, YYR in chat says,

983
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:57,000
BRB gonna politely ask my Gotcha mobile game for that five-star legendary I've been trying to pull.

984
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:02,000
Questbuster says, they can be done right, but when the focus is on companies that make them pretty terrible,

985
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
they just paint everything with that brush.

986
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:08,000
And Act F says, I don't mind loot boxes if done correctly and not shoved down,

987
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:12,000
and especially if the loot boxes have accessories that have items that can help you win a game.

988
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:17,000
Well, you don't necessarily want something that's, like, you're gonna, like, you need it to beat the game.

989
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:21,000
Or I think another example of, like, how this went really wrong was when they put, like,

990
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:26,000
and correct me if I'm wrong, but, like, Darth Vader was in a loot box in Star Wars, right?

991
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
And they also had pay-to-win stuff that was in there.

992
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:31,000
Yeah, and that's kind of, especially when you're showing that shit in the trailer, that's shady, you know?

993
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,000
So, that's all I think.

994
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,000
But it's EA, and they knew the fuck they were doing.

995
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:40,000
But, and didn't we talk, I said, like, if you want to put a pink Darth Vader costume in a loot box,

996
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
that would be much different, and awesome, actually.

997
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
And they said no one wanted that.

998
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:49,000
But, yes, no, I understand that EA said that, because it would break canon.

999
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:50,000
Well...

1000
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:56,000
But then, at the same time, you know, we have, like, all these different heroes from different timelines

1001
01:00:56,000 --> 01:01:02,000
in the Star Wars universe running around together, and, you know, that doesn't break canon.

1002
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:07,000
Yeah, no, I don't, it's silly, it's ridiculous.

1003
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:12,000
And we're still recording for our podcast, but for some reason our Twitch dropped live,

1004
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:15,000
and I noticed our internet just went, like, boo, like, it just cut out.

1005
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:19,000
But I think it's a hiccup. I think we're back up and running now, the joys of live internet.

1006
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:23,000
But I saw, when people started complaining in chat, people was like,

1007
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:27,000
EA's killed the stream for them talking too much, I can see people in chat,

1008
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:31,000
and then I looked over in the little box on OBS, it's like, orange, red.

1009
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,000
And so, yeah, we just had a little hiccup.

1010
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:37,000
Little, little hiccup in the server, going to Twitch, that's weird.

1011
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:41,000
But, like, I stayed in chat, and everything else was working, so I don't think it was our internet.

1012
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,000
Oh well, things happen.

1013
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:47,000
Sorry, guys, we do our very best, but there's gonna just be things that are out of our control.

1014
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,000
You're right, EA might be trying to pull the plug.

1015
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:55,000
That's right, Act F, it was not an internet outage, it was a surprise hiccup.

1016
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:58,000
That was Act F's words.

1017
01:01:58,000 --> 01:01:59,000
Surprise break.

1018
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,000
A surprise hiccup.

1019
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:05,000
Okay, that was just a feature of our show, alright.

1020
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,000
That's why you all show up live.

1021
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,000
Alright, let's move on.

1022
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:13,000
So we've talked a lot about Niantic already, but, you know,

1023
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:17,000
they're stepping up to be a major, major game maker in this industry.

1024
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:21,000
And they've made another big move this week, they bought another company.

1025
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:26,000
They've bought a few, because they bought, like, a profile making company or something a while ago, I remember that.

1026
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:34,000
But we haven't seen what they've done with that, really, yet, unless some of that technology went into those, like, very elaborate avatars in Harry Potter, maybe, I don't know.

1027
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
What, elaborate avatars?

1028
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:41,000
If you go into your little cart, those, like, Snapchat filters that she said she liked, you put, like, wigs on your character and stuff, but it's...

1029
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:42,000
Not that elaborate.

1030
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
It's about as, well, it's silly.

1031
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:47,000
It's more elaborate than Pokemon Go, that's for sure.

1032
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:53,000
But anyway, Niantic also has purchased a company called Sensible Object.

1033
01:02:53,000 --> 01:03:01,000
Sensible Object is based out of London, and they are probably best known for making combination digital and tabletop games.

1034
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:12,000
Their first game was called Beasts of Balance, where you go into a fantasy world and you have physical stackable creations, but you, they translate into digital points scoring.

1035
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:16,000
It kind of, I don't know why, but I'm reminded of, like, DropMix, right?

1036
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:20,000
Which is, like, the card game by Harmonix, but you use a phone app to play all the music.

1037
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
It's kind of like, and that game is really cool, if you've never played it.

1038
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:27,000
Like, even if you don't really care for music games, just to kind of see that technology in motion is, like, really awesome.

1039
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:29,000
So, yeah.

1040
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:33,000
So, we don't know why Niantic has purchased this.

1041
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:38,000
A lot of folks wondering, is it related to Harry Potter or Pokemon?

1042
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:41,000
Maybe there'll be little physical Pokemon that do something.

1043
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:42,000
Could it be related?

1044
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:50,000
I've seen a thought that maybe Ingress, how Ingress has an anime, maybe there's going to be a board game at some point of Ingress that might tie in.

1045
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:53,000
Who knows, but I think it's a given.

1046
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:59,000
You know, if Harry Potter's made as much money as it did out the gate, Pokemon Go is still continuing to rake in the money.

1047
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:02,000
Ingress is cute.

1048
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
Ingress has a passionate community.

1049
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,000
You know what? I'll say that from first hand.

1050
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:11,000
Ingress has a, I didn't talk about it in my gaming week, but I went to Berkeley to do this thing called Mission Day in Ingress.

1051
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:15,000
And it was still, like, it wasn't a huge crowd, but it was 150 people that turned out to do different missions.

1052
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:16,000
So, quite a bit.

1053
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:17,000
Yeah.

1054
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:18,000
So, it has a passionate community.

1055
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:19,000
We'll say that.

1056
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:22,000
So, I'm sure Niantic's not stopping there.

1057
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
And they know what their next game's going to be.

1058
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
We just don't know what it is yet.

1059
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:29,000
And will it be on an existing IP already?

1060
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:30,000
Who knows?

1061
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:33,000
That should be, we haven't done listless in a long time in this show.

1062
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,000
That should be something we do in the future.

1063
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:39,000
What IP should Niantic make an AR game out of next?

1064
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,000
I think that would be a fun one.

1065
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:43,000
That would be pretty fun.

1066
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:44,000
Yeah.

1067
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:45,000
But anyway, yeah.

1068
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:48,000
What do you think about, like, board game meets mobile game type of thing?

1069
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,000
Eye of Judgment?

1070
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:54,000
Yeah, you can't help but think of the Eye of Judgment on PS3.

1071
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:55,000
You're right, you're right.

1072
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:57,000
But that's more AR gaming.

1073
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,000
That's not necessarily a board game.

1074
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,000
Well, their hybrids are AR games.

1075
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,000
Yeah, that's what Niantic does is AR games, though.

1076
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,000
So, yeah.

1077
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:12,000
I think, though, if you did a collectible card game that had that AR component,

1078
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
then that would be pretty fun.

1079
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:17,000
Because then you could change your cards, you know, like you were talking about before with the loot box thing.

1080
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:21,000
You know, have your cards that you can trade around and build your decks.

1081
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,000
Well, they did magic that way.

1082
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:28,000
That would be cool to have, like, the battle happen while you're playing the game

1083
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:33,000
and not have to sit in front of your computer and, you know, play something that's, you know, 70 years old.

1084
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:39,000
So maybe, I mean, honestly, you're not describing something that's that terribly different from Eye of Judgment.

1085
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:43,000
But with Eye of Judgment, you had to have this PlayStation 3, you had to have your camera and all this setup.

1086
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,000
Now maybe you just have to have your mobile phone.

1087
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:46,000
See, that's how it should be.

1088
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:47,000
Yeah.

1089
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:50,000
And even better if you've got, like, one of the VR kits for it.

1090
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:53,000
Something like that.

1091
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:58,000
Is the gag of 17 years of this show going to be that Eye of Judgment was merely ahead of its time?

1092
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:02,000
Kind of it was, though. I mean...

1093
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:05,000
Oh my god. I'm gonna cry.

1094
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:07,000
You're matching your shirt now.

1095
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:11,000
I feel like we've just had this big, like, explosion here on the show.

1096
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:15,000
Is that for our 17th birthday, we finally just come to this realization.

1097
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,000
Eye of Judgment was just ahead of its time.

1098
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:21,000
I kind of think that it was. I mean, we made a lot of fun of it.

1099
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:28,000
But maybe it's just because, you know, VR and AR were not big things then?

1100
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
Well, and the name was really bad.

1101
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:31,000
Okay.

1102
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:32,000
The Brown Eye of Judgment?

1103
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,000
The Brown Eye of Judgment. I still remember that.

1104
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:35,000
Hold up here, okay?

1105
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:39,000
It was not ahead of its time. It was a fucking dumb idea, is why.

1106
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,000
And I'll tell you why it was a dumb idea.

1107
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:44,000
Because it added fucking nothing to the game.

1108
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:48,000
All it did was animate the stupid cards that you put down on the board.

1109
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:51,000
That's it. You were still playing a card game,

1110
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:53,000
just like you would play, like, Magic the Gathering,

1111
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:55,000
except it just animated some stupid shit.

1112
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,000
But then you had to set up your stupid camera

1113
01:06:57,000 --> 01:07:00,000
and have it hooked up to a PlayStation and a TV to view...

1114
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
Ooh, it's a battle happening.

1115
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:05,000
Whereas if you did it with your phone, your phone would move around.

1116
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:10,000
But it's... they already have it. It's not engaging enough, you know, as it...

1117
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
It wasn't engaging enough as a standalone game.

1118
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:15,000
It's not gonna be engaging with this stupid shit that you have to tie to it.

1119
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:21,000
So, no, it was a crappy game. It's not ahead of its time. It was garbage.

1120
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:24,000
Well, I just got told. I don't know.

1121
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
I... I'm... I...

1122
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:29,000
There are elements of it that were maybe...

1123
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:32,000
They had two chances to bring that stupid game out.

1124
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:36,000
And it couldn't sell a million copies combined. So, too bad.

1125
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:39,000
Get over it. It'll never happen.

1126
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:41,000
All I want is Sony out there listening.

1127
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:45,000
Maybe all I want, put Eye of Judgment on mobile so we can get it a million downloads

1128
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:47,000
because it'll count.

1129
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
Alright, anyway, anything else you want to say on that, Darcira?

1130
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:51,000
No.

1131
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,000
Alright, then why don't we move on to our next story?

1132
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:54,000
No, it's me anyway.

1133
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:55,000
Yes, it is.

1134
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:59,000
Steam! I haven't looked at my Steam account in an age.

1135
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:02,000
But Steam is adding new tags for their games.

1136
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,000
You know, like, right now they have, like,

1137
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:07,000
Difficult or Action or Souls-like.

1138
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:10,000
Like, talking about Sekiro, which is hard as fuck.

1139
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:14,000
So, you know, when you click on the tag, it takes you to a page about the tag.

1140
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:15,000
You can see what it is.

1141
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:18,000
Well, they are doing LGBTQ Plus tags now.

1142
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:28,000
So these are games that are either related to LGBTQ Plus issues or have interest.

1143
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:33,000
Or I think also maybe including the developer, maybe?

1144
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:43,000
But it's to help games that may be a little more niche or smaller be more discoverable.

1145
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:52,000
You know, especially now that people will look for games that are going to represent the world they live in or the world they want to live in.

1146
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:53,000
Sure.

1147
01:08:53,000 --> 01:09:00,000
You know, like, when Dream Daddy came out, what would the average person think if they just see a bunch of dudes and Dream Daddy?

1148
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:06,000
They wouldn't know it's necessarily about, you know, man daddies.

1149
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:09,000
No, I gotcha. I gotcha.

1150
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:11,000
Excuse me. That cake's that bad.

1151
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
They could be looking for a sugar daddy.

1152
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:17,000
You know what they should do?

1153
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:18,000
What?

1154
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:19,000
They should do a sequel and call it Bear Hunt.

1155
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
Bears and Cubs and Otters, oh my.

1156
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
Oh my. There's animals for everything.

1157
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,000
It's neat. I mean, happy pride.

1158
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:34,000
It definitely does seem like, hey, it's nice to see a company actually doing something besides releasing a rainbow logo for pride.

1159
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:35,000
That's pretty cool.

1160
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:41,000
And I think, you know, there's a lot of, especially when it comes to, like, the stories that really go in depth.

1161
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:46,000
There's a lot of great games out there that explore, you know, same sex relationships.

1162
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:57,000
And maybe if you're somebody that wants to see yourself represented in there because you grew up in a world where it was always, you know, hero rescues princess.

1163
01:09:57,000 --> 01:10:00,000
And, you know, they live happily ever after and that sort of thing.

1164
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:06,000
You know, if you want to find something that maybe is a little more representative for you, I think it's cool that Steam is allowing, like, a way to do that.

1165
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:13,000
And this actually comes, though, after the non-approved tags lost their hub.

1166
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:21,000
And it did leave a lot of developers just behind because they had made these games to tell queer stories.

1167
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:30,000
And so by putting it back and keeping it, you know, as something now that's a true curated tag, it puts that visibility back on there.

1168
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:33,000
And this isn't, you know, just rainbow capitalism.

1169
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:40,000
They make no money off of putting that on there other than maybe whatever revenue might come.

1170
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:42,000
I don't exactly know how that works.

1171
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:54,000
But at any rate, this is really, really good for visibility and good for people, for representation.

1172
01:10:55,000 --> 01:11:01,000
And there's a quote in here from one of the people who actually contacted Valve directly about the lack of a tag.

1173
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:07,000
He said, people are going to be shitty no matter what. The tag is important.

1174
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:09,000
Yeah. Very cool.

1175
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:16,000
PixelPaka's in chat says, interesting timing with how they recently blocked a non-explicit lesbian visual novel from releasing on Steam.

1176
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:19,000
But they later allowed it after people spoke up about it.

1177
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:24,000
So there may still be some problems with how things are being implemented consistently.

1178
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:33,000
But, you know, it's nice to at least see them kind of take this step and make it a little easier because the Steam store kind of can be a mess.

1179
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:35,000
I attributed that to the wrong person.

1180
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:43,000
It's a developer named NOHUA, N-O-H-U-A, I guess is an acronym.

1181
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:49,000
But it's someone on their Discord chat who said that. The people are going to be shitty no matter what.

1182
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:57,000
But I'm going to be honest. I don't usually do the click tags on Steam. I realize other people do, so that's cool.

1183
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:05,000
Twitter for me has been a huge, and Facebook to some extent, even though there's so much garbage on Facebook to sift through.

1184
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:11,000
And there's a lot of garbage on Twitter too, quite honestly. But I try to curate different lists of people.

1185
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:20,000
I have a list of basically gay gamer and LGBTQ plus gamers that I follow on Twitter.

1186
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:29,000
And honestly, if people recommend a game because they're like, oh, this story was so good and I felt seen by it, I'm way more likely to check it out based on that.

1187
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,000
Nothing is ever going to beat a personal recommendation in that regard.

1188
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:39,000
So I kind of feel like the best way, if you want to find games like that, the internet is a great place.

1189
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:44,000
Find a little club. Find your niche out there of people like you.

1190
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:46,000
Find your tribe.

1191
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:47,000
Find your tribe.

1192
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:54,000
Yeah, find your tribe. That's a great way to put it. There's plenty of gay gaming, bear gaming groups or whatever on Facebook.

1193
01:12:55,000 --> 01:13:03,000
I'm sure Dark Sakura, I don't know if there's necessarily ace gaming groups, but there's certainly got to be ace groups on Facebook, and the topic of gaming surely comes up.

1194
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:12,000
Well, you know, when I asked the first GamerX that I attended, for Borderlands, I was like, when are we going to see ace characters?

1195
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,000
Like, actually, we have one. There you go.

1196
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:16,000
There you go.

1197
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:20,000
I was like, oh, that's right, because I didn't see any semblance of romantic anything.

1198
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:28,000
And now we've got more ace characters, you know, on TV or in shows or in comics, and I'm really glad to see the representation.

1199
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:45,000
You know, I would like for, you know, when you're browsing that tab, you know, then you have like maybe a sub thing, you know, has ace character, has pan romantic, intersex character, you know, something like that.

1200
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:50,000
I don't, I mean, yes and no. Like, I just want to see descriptions to help me figure it out.

1201
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:59,000
But at the same time, I don't, our community is already so fragmented and so segmented, I feel like that togetherness is something we have to work on a lot.

1202
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,000
But like, I don't want to discount what you're saying either, because I do see the advantages of that.

1203
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:05,000
But I just worry about having all those little buckets.

1204
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:07,000
I'm going to say one thing.

1205
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:17,000
That same argument has been used against trans women and queer women from organizing in their own spaces to discuss the issues within the LGBT community.

1206
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:22,000
But I think a video game store and that are two like super different things.

1207
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:28,000
But also, I just accept the fact trans women are women, period. Like, there's no debating that.

1208
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:30,000
But their struggles are going to be different than...

1209
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:35,000
And I understand. But shouldn't that, like that could be in a description or something. I just don't want it...

1210
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:43,000
Well, no, I understand that, but I'm just meaning like the descriptions will say something, hey, has characters like this in it.

1211
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:57,000
Here's my point. Here's my real point is that, and it actually kind of piggies back on what you said in response there, is that like gay dudes kind of need to see those trans stories and the people that are also in their family.

1212
01:14:58,000 --> 01:14:59,000
Totally.

1213
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:01,000
And that's why I said what I said.

1214
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:14,000
The biggest transphobia that I see second to straight white men is gay white men. I see a lot of misogyny in amongst, you know, gay men.

1215
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:21,000
Oh, did you see that Tales from the City? There's a scene in it that'll knock your socks off. Oh my God.

1216
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,000
I just knew the thing about the sisters in vodka.

1217
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:26,000
Oh yeah, that's in the first episode.

1218
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:33,000
Now I'm going to have to watch that show because I hear there's a lot. If it's a misogynist getting like, you know, punched in the face, I'm down for it.

1219
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:44,000
The person does not get their comeuppance, if that's what you're hoping for. But it's definitely a scene where I think it makes the viewer kind of like...

1220
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:51,000
It's a viewer thinking moment and like, who am I really rooting for in this moment? I think it's a teachable moment more than anything.

1221
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:58,000
And I think that's why it's written really well because it doesn't necessarily, you know, and then he punched him in the face. Yay!

1222
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:01,000
Some of my friends, though, are in that first episode.

1223
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:03,000
That's really cool.

1224
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:05,000
I'll have to go look.

1225
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:09,000
Anyway, we digressed a little bit, but that happens here at OLR if you've never been here before. Let's move on.

1226
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:18,000
And getting onto a topic that no matter where you are on the rainbow or anywhere else, I'm sure a lot of people are getting excited about this idea.

1227
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:35,000
Yeah, well, especially with Mario Maker 2 coming out this week and then also the fact that we saw during E3, they kind of teased a little bit of this chamber dungeon mode that allows you to create your own dungeons and share them in Link's Awakening.

1228
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:50,000
So that, of course, prompted the question to E.G. Onomura, I can't pronounce the names today, that, hey, so if this mode is successful, will you make Zelda Maker?

1229
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:57,000
And he said, you know, I can't predict the future, but if people do love this idea of arranging dungeons, I'll keep that in mind going forward.

1230
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:02,000
So it's not a no. So what they're saying is, there's a chance.

1231
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,000
So you're saying there's a chance?

1232
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:06,000
Yes.

1233
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:11,000
So, but in order to make it happen, you have to buy tons of copies of the upcoming Zelda release.

1234
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:15,000
I don't know about that. I would say just like, you know, making lots of dungeons and sharing them and utilizing that feature.

1235
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:17,000
Yeah.

1236
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:19,000
I mean, yeah, it would be cool.

1237
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:27,000
You've got to think, I think honestly a lot of it also rides on how well this, you know, because next week Super Mario Maker 2 comes out and I think a lot of people are going to be really thrilled about that.

1238
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:39,000
So, you know, if that continues to do well, I don't know if they're necessarily going to think about a Mario Maker 3 or if they might think about what other of our games will this formula kind of work on, you know?

1239
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:41,000
I want to see an NES remix maker.

1240
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:47,000
I would love that. But at the same time, I also realize that some ideas might be more complex in execution than we think.

1241
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:54,000
But I love Nintendo getting into this creation and creativity space.

1242
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:56,000
Yeah.

1243
01:17:57,000 --> 01:18:03,000
Namely like Mario Maker is basically, I mean, you know, hello, Mario Paint was a creative game to some extent.

1244
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:05,000
So we can't say like Nintendo's never been here.

1245
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:13,000
But not just the fact that it is like, you know, something creative, but it's using one of their big IPs to do it and with the shareableness that it has.

1246
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,000
And I know the game's taken a lot of shit for not being able to play games all along with your friends.

1247
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:18,000
Obviously they've heard that they're going to fix that and so forth.

1248
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:24,000
But I just love seeing Nintendo kind of get into that in this internet age, you know, that it's basically their own version, a little big planet.

1249
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:26,000
So I kind of want to see kind of where it goes from here.

1250
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:28,000
I want to see their own version of a little big planet.

1251
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:38,000
Yeah. Sia Tabiri in chat says, Game Theory released a video today on YouTube's effect on new gaming trends and the rise and fall of certain game franchises.

1252
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:44,000
Oh, sure. I mean, not just YouTube, but Twitch and all the places where you can watch, you know, gameplay footage, I think definitely.

1253
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:54,000
I mean, games like Minecraft, to some extent, probably wouldn't be as big as they are if it were not for YouTube and Twitch.

1254
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:55,000
Yeah.

1255
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:59,000
And Player Unknown Battlegrounds and therefore Fortnite, Battle Royale.

1256
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:01,000
And even before that...

1257
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:03,000
I don't think it could not really be as big of a deal as it was.

1258
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:09,000
No, even before the H1Z1, there was... I'm trying to think what else.

1259
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:13,000
Well, real quick, let me continue Sia Tabiri's thoughts.

1260
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:20,000
I think YouTubers can help push a Zelda maker into reality if the LA dungeon maker ends up being successful there.

1261
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:26,000
They blamed YouTube for the failure of Mortal Kombat 11. I heard Mortal Kombat 11 was like doing phenomenally well.

1262
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:28,000
Yeah.

1263
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:33,000
They've got more DLC coming out too. They just did the Shang Tsung release and all that. Yeah, it's great.

1264
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:39,000
But Sia Tabiri does say, because of the monetization rules, cursing, violence, etc. lead to demonetization.

1265
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:49,000
So maybe if you're hanging out on YouTube a lot, it feels like Mortal Kombat 11 is not as present because people don't want to make videos about it because they're going to get demonetized due to the extreme level of violence in the game.

1266
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:53,000
Here's one channel I've been doing nothing but.

1267
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,000
That's a YouTube thing in my opinion, but we won't go there.

1268
01:19:57,000 --> 01:20:04,000
Tiger Claw says, a Zelda maker would be interesting, but then people would design dungeons that are super hard and have very complex puzzles to pass them.

1269
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:11,000
Sure, but there's always going to be the hell levels, but there's going to be people that just make cute stuff too and creative stuff.

1270
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:21,000
Like, and I know I've said this on the show before and I'm going to say it again. The best thing I ever saw in LittleBigPlanet 1 was that level that was like my shrine to Parker Posey.

1271
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:28,000
And you played through the level and you would unlock, because you could take pictures with the camera and like stickers you get along.

1272
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:36,000
And so you just unlocked all these stickers of Parker Posey as you played the level. And there was like Parker Posey trivia that would come up as you played the level.

1273
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:43,000
And I was like, this is so ridiculous that I love it because Parker Posey is pretty awesome, y'all.

1274
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:49,000
I know y'all saw Scream 3, right? Hello? Party girl? Anybody? Waiting for Guffman?

1275
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:51,000
I didn't see it.

1276
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:55,000
Right, anyway. Alright, let's move on.

1277
01:20:56,000 --> 01:21:01,000
Obviously E3 just wrapped up and one thing that was missing from E3 was Metroid Prime 4.

1278
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:09,000
It wasn't there and a lot of people noticed it was missing. And what's really strange about it, in an interview with Eurogamer, they asked,

1279
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:16,000
I can't not ask you about a certain other project you're working on. Metroid Prime 4. We haven't seen anything of it at all, this E3.

1280
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:22,000
Do you have an update for fans patiently waiting for it? And Kensuke Tanabe replied from Nintendo,

1281
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:29,000
I shouldn't say. It's a little tricky. To be completely honest, at this E3, I just want people to pay attention to Luigi.

1282
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:35,000
If I mention something about Metroid Prime 4, people will focus on that. But when the time comes, I'm so ready to talk about it.

1283
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:42,000
Which led to this headline, Metroid Prime 4 was not mentioned at E3 because they wanted people to focus on Luigi's Mansion 3.

1284
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:51,000
I think from that quote, we just find the reality of E3. Is that if they had brought Metroid Prime 4 to the show,

1285
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:55,000
people wouldn't be asking nearly as many questions about Luigi's Mansion 3.

1286
01:21:55,000 --> 01:22:01,000
So I think you can read between the lines and the response there and say it was a very carefully chosen what we did,

1287
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:06,000
and we didn't want to show because we wanted to control the narrative of what was being discussed.

1288
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:11,000
That's what every gaming company does at E3. There's so much planning that goes into it.

1289
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:17,000
But honestly, I just took it as they just said not that long ago that Metroid Prime 4 was basically rebooted.

1290
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:22,000
They did that whole direction in February. So I just assumed it wasn't ready.

1291
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:29,000
I was more surprised that they didn't announce like a, and here's a Metroid Prime trilogy on Switch to hold you over.

1292
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:35,000
Or here's a remaster of Metroid Prime 1 where we just kind of turned up the graphics on level 3.

1293
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:37,000
We did a little extra polish.

1294
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:39,000
We just had AI go through and high res all the textures.

1295
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:44,000
Yeah, we did a little bit, not a ton, but a little something to get you interested in it again.

1296
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:50,000
Because obviously we don't want them taking too many hours from Metroid Prime 4, but I think we all know that.

1297
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:51,000
Have another company do it.

1298
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:53,000
Yeah, yeah, that'd be cool.

1299
01:22:54,000 --> 01:23:00,000
And as to 100 Matt does say, they made that announcement six months ago saying they were starting from scratch for Metroid Prime 4.

1300
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:04,000
So it's kind of nuts to expect that they have something for E3 in six months.

1301
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:10,000
And vidpower573 says, I assume Nintendo put all their focus on the big reveal of Breath of the Wild 2.

1302
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:17,000
Sia Tabiri says, how about the big Animal Crossing thing? Wouldn't that have overshadowed MP4 or the opposite?

1303
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:20,000
I kind of think there's room for both because they're such different games.

1304
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:25,000
But I also think that about Luigi's Mansion 3, I mean that there's room for both games.

1305
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:31,000
But perhaps the excitement of something like Metroid Prime 4 may have made people only ask about that.

1306
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,000
And so I kind of get it in a way.

1307
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:38,000
But I think that game is still going to be a little ways out. I don't think we're going to see it right away.

1308
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:42,000
But you know, if they rebooted it, then they clearly had a reason for doing it.

1309
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:44,000
So we'll see what happens.

1310
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:50,000
Moving on. Let's get to our next story. Let's get a little political, I guess, in this next story.

1311
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:54,000
Well, I found this actually kind of randomly.

1312
01:23:55,000 --> 01:24:01,000
And I will say this. I'm a Bernie babe. I like Bernie. He's got really good chances.

1313
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:03,000
And that's all I'm going to say.

1314
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:13,000
But Bernie, being the lovely socialist like he is, brought up video game developers.

1315
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:20,000
And on top of that, he actually is encouraging them to unionize.

1316
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:23,000
And I will read the quote from his tweet. Sorry.

1317
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:27,000
The video game industry made $43 billion in revenue last year.

1318
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:33,000
The workers responsible for that profit deserve to collectively bargain as a part of a union.

1319
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:40,000
I'm glad to see unions like IATSC and the broader Game Workers Movement organizing such workers.

1320
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:47,000
And he linked the Time article about the burnout going on rampant in the industry.

1321
01:24:51,000 --> 01:25:02,000
But the other thing, too, is just that he's always been talking for people to unionize, to stand up for their rights.

1322
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:09,000
And I think that it was actually pretty, a bit surprising, but very good to see that he's including the video game industry with that same call.

1323
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:15,000
Especially in light of the recent issues that developers have been working with.

1324
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:17,000
That crunch time bullshit.

1325
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:33,000
And it's also really good. Even just recently, AFL-CIO published a letter in Kotaku for calling for developers to join in with their union and everything.

1326
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:40,000
So the Game Workers Unite, though, is a pretty good place to start looking if you are in the video game industry and want to unionize.

1327
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:47,000
I think it's pretty neat that a politician has, and to be disclosed, I have not figured out, there's still so many candidates in it.

1328
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:54,000
And I'm also focused on the fact, I just want to make sure whoever comes out of that battle royale thing is the one that feeds you-know-who.

1329
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:59,000
Just remember, Biden called Anita Hill a liar.

1330
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:06,000
You know I'm a very strong opinion that now is not the time to cut all the people down because we don't know who's going to come out of it.

1331
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:09,000
So I'm going to support whoever comes out of it.

1332
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:25,000
But as far as it goes, I think it is really neat to see that there is somebody who is willing to call out the game industry like that because of the fact that the game industry has always been something that is very underground.

1333
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:29,000
We always think, we kind of forget it's as big as it really is, right?

1334
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:34,000
Because a lot of us come from the 80s and 90s era of when games were things that nerds did.

1335
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:39,000
But now the reality is, game is everything that Hollywood is and more.

1336
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:43,000
And certainly politicians have had their piece to say on Hollywood, so all of them.

1337
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:46,000
So why not be commenting on the games industry as well?

1338
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:51,000
So I think that's really cool that somebody is talking about it, and I'm sure more will too.

1339
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:58,000
Well on top of that, Bernie also did poke at Disney to pay their workers more after Avengers Endgame.

1340
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:01,000
You know, with the big ass money that that makes.

1341
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:12,000
I mean, I actually want to see the industries taxed more and see them be responsible for taking care of the people that they're making money off of.

1342
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:19,000
So this is even more of a, I've cemented for me my decision.

1343
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:25,000
I'll say this, and folks in chat are kind of asking questions and stuff.

1344
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:32,000
If I had to vote tomorrow, and not to get into debate, but if I had to vote tomorrow, I'd vote for Elizabeth Warren, is who I'd vote for right now.

1345
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:36,000
But I totally reserve the right to change my mind.

1346
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:43,000
Right now, I'm in primary brain mode. I'm looking at who would best fit my ideals.

1347
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:46,000
If Bernie wasn't there, it would be Warren for me.

1348
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:52,000
Biden would be in the toilet, because he's nothing without Obama, to keep him in fucking control.

1349
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:58,000
But at any rate, right now, I'm thinking in terms of primaries.

1350
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:03,000
I'm thinking in terms of putting my support behind the one I think is going to do the best job.

1351
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:13,000
And whoever comes out of it, I'm probably still going to vote for him, even if it's Biden, because he's a big, terrible, misogynist racist.

1352
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:15,000
But...

1353
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:20,000
I think he's old and foolish. I don't know if those other things are true.

1354
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:24,000
Go back and watch the trial with Anita Hill.

1355
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:26,000
I'm not going to get apologized. I'm just not.

1356
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:35,000
But at any rate, that's why I'm focusing more on primary right now.

1357
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:38,000
Putting my weight behind who I think is going to be the best job.

1358
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:43,000
And this is just another thing that, and I didn't post it because, oh, I want everyone to vote for Bernie.

1359
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:49,000
It's because he's really one of the first people who has said something about it in the political spectrum.

1360
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:56,000
And one reason why I did say what I said about Elizabeth Warren is one thing that has constantly impressed me about her,

1361
01:28:57,000 --> 01:29:01,000
and I tie this into this, and why you bring up this Bernie thing, and it's not like a personal preference or whatever, I get that,

1362
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:07,000
is because Warren has come out and said, this is my plan for this. This is my plan for that.

1363
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:09,000
This is what I'm going to do. This is what I'm going to do.

1364
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:15,000
And she's like laid it out. And that's one thing I really admire about her is that I feel like she's not blowing smoke up my ass,

1365
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:19,000
which I can't say that about necessarily everybody I've ever seen run for that office.

1366
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:27,000
So that's, you know, so if they feel the need to respond to this, and I'll kind of start to wrap up with this comment,

1367
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:31,000
if they feel the need to respond to this, I'm encouraged that maybe Warren might come out and say,

1368
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:35,000
yes, the game developers need to unionize, and this is what I'm going to do to Google, and this is what I'm going to do,

1369
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:39,000
and this is what I think they should do, and so forth. I hope, you know, because she's kind of done that for me so far.

1370
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:41,000
I want them on a ticket together.

1371
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:46,000
I don't want to get too, I don't think they ultimately will. They're both great. Don't get me wrong.

1372
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:48,000
But I would kill to see it.

1373
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:52,000
Everybody would, but the point of a ticket is you have to have a little column A, a little column B.

1374
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:53,000
You know what I mean? So, anyway.

1375
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:58,000
All right, moving on. Who are you voting for, Loki? No, I'm just kidding. Don't answer. Go to the next question.

1376
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:02,000
I mean, I've got to back my man Trump, because he's going to be off.

1377
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:04,000
No one's going to vote for him.

1378
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:07,000
No one in intelligence is going to vote for him.

1379
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:11,000
People probably watching this, there are some that might, but I just...

1380
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:13,000
Didn't stop. Just stop.

1381
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:18,000
I'm going to say, like, really listen to the complaints of the people complaining,

1382
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:26,000
and, like, for me, here's the thing. This administration has put the T in LGBTQ under attack consistently,

1383
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:31,000
and I'm going to stick up for my brothers and sisters, because it's fucked up what is happening.

1384
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:33,000
It is beyond belief.

1385
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:37,000
How many trans people of color have been murdered just in the last month and a half?

1386
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:41,000
Yeah. So, anyway, without, sorry, I know we've probably gone too far in the deep end so far.

1387
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:43,000
You know what? It needs to be said.

1388
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:44,000
It needs to be said.

1389
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:47,000
Like, yeah, but I'm just like, you know, if you are somebody that's, you know, on that train or whatever,

1390
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:53,000
like, all I can say to try to meet you halfway is, like, just try to listen to why people are as bothered as they are.

1391
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:59,000
So, anyway, moving on. Loki. Non-political.

1392
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:01,000
Oh, wait, no.

1393
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:03,000
It's semi-political.

1394
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:10,000
We'll try to make it not as political, but basically, so there was an interview with Phil Spencer talking a little bit about the Xbox platform,

1395
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:17,000
because you remember during the Xbox press conference, they had mentioned a few things talking about, you know,

1396
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:22,000
how they want to build a safe and inclusive gaming environment for everyone.

1397
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:31,000
So, you know, along with that, you know, he's kind of said that basically, hey, listen, you know, to be upfront,

1398
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:34,000
everyone says, oh, free speech, we should be allowed to do whatever.

1399
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:36,000
Xbox Live is not a free speech platform.

1400
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:43,000
It's not a place where anybody can come and say anything, and we're working to ensure it's safe and inclusive environment for everybody.

1401
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:51,000
I don't want to be opaque about it. I want to be out there in front and center so that you understand our motivation.

1402
01:31:52,000 --> 01:32:01,000
So, of course, what they're going to be doing along with that is looking to identify potentials for abuse and misuse on our platform,

1403
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:03,000
and they're going to fix problems quickly.

1404
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:07,000
They said hate and harassment have no place in gaming, and I think that's a good start,

1405
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:14,000
considering that the Xbox Live community for the longest time had kind of this big,

1406
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:22,000
you kind of put hate speech in like asshole children along with, you know, kind of, it's synonymous with that platform,

1407
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:28,000
and it's kind of good to see them trying to move away from that, because really it shouldn't.

1408
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:36,000
It doesn't belong in any platform, really, but people, when they hide behind anonymity, they act like complete assholes,

1409
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:43,000
so you can't fix the problem completely, but you can sure as hell make it hard for them.

1410
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:48,000
I think it's great. Say what you will about whether this will work or not and change either image,

1411
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:54,000
but I do love, Microsoft is in such a better direction now under Phil Spencer than it has been probably ever,

1412
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:58,000
so I'm going to give Phil Spencer major, major kudos. I'm such a fan.

1413
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:06,000
That being said, I think it's great when a company says they will do something and that they're going to,

1414
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:13,000
I mean, even if they're not going to eventually be successful because you can't police every conversation out there and so forth,

1415
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:21,000
I think that has to start by kind of setting the stage of this is gaming and everybody can game,

1416
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:25,000
and to hear that kind of at the corporate level, that that's what they support,

1417
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:30,000
and that gaming is not some exclusive click in somebody's basement anymore,

1418
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:38,000
that we believe that everybody should be able to play games, I think that is a huge start in setting the right tone,

1419
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:44,000
but you add anonymity and people are always going to get ugly and things like that,

1420
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:49,000
so I'm not sure, again, how successful it's going to be. I'm kind of on the same page with SSG100Matt,

1421
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:54,000
where he says, on this XBL topic, I'll believe it when I see it.

1422
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:59,000
So, yeah, I kind of don't think Xbox Live is going to change overnight, that's for sure,

1423
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:03,000
but it is very nice for Microsoft to kind of say like, you know, this is what we believe,

1424
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:07,000
and these are the actions we're going to take to try to demonstrate it. It's something.

1425
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:12,000
You're not going to, because the way it's going ain't working, so there's that.

1426
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:17,000
All right, Questbuster in chat says, everyone not on my friends list is muted,

1427
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:20,000
and honestly, that's how I tend to play online these days as well,

1428
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:24,000
but I do play MMOs and stuff where I get exposed to people with text chat,

1429
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:32,000
but honestly, the number of dirtbags I run into on something like Final Fantasy XIV or even WoW is like,

1430
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:36,000
especially if I don't join general chat, I'll see a lot if I join general chat,

1431
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:42,000
but if I play Final Fantasy XIV in a party or something, I very rarely, very rarely see shitty behavior.

1432
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:46,000
Sure, I do see shitty behavior, but it's the vast minority of what I run into,

1433
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:50,000
and it's very easy to just drop the party, block the person, and re-cue,

1434
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:54,000
or you may take a 30-minute penalty, but you know what, it's worth it,

1435
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:58,000
than having to go back in the dungeon with that particular individual,

1436
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:02,000
because most people just want to play the fucking game.

1437
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:06,000
Unfortunately, some people get on there and are really loud and ruin it for everybody else.

1438
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:12,000
Alright, anyway, let's move on though, we've got a few more stories to cover here.

1439
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:16,000
We're going to get to a story about Twitch, actually, very meta.

1440
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:18,000
We're going to talk about Twitch on Twitch.

1441
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:21,000
Twitch also bought a something something this week,

1442
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:23,000
so Niantic made a purchase, but so did Twitch.

1443
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:27,000
Twitch bought a company called Bebo, I think is how you pronounce it.

1444
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:31,000
I have never heard of Bebo, but apparently Bebo, like back in the day,

1445
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:35,000
was Facebook, Myspace in the UK.

1446
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:37,000
I've never heard of that.

1447
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:39,000
Yeah, but it was never really something that caught on here.

1448
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:44,000
Because I think that's where, like, one of the Asian chat sites derived from.

1449
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:47,000
Oh yeah, I think so, I think you're right.

1450
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:51,000
Because, you know, Friendster, it was like kind of the first,

1451
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:54,000
a lot of people thought Friendster had a very Asian audience

1452
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:56,000
after most people kind of left it for Myspace.

1453
01:35:57,000 --> 01:36:02,000
And Google had a network, what the hell, it was not Plus,

1454
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:04,000
they had one before it.

1455
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:05,000
And I can't remember the name of it,

1456
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:07,000
but it was another one of those ones that everybody got on,

1457
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:09,000
and then it was huge in, like, Brazil.

1458
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:12,000
It was like a huge, God, what, Orkut?

1459
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:14,000
Was that the name of it? Was that a Google thing at one point?

1460
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:16,000
I think it was. It was called Orkut, something like that.

1461
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:19,000
So, I should bring up chat because I bet somebody knows.

1462
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:23,000
It's one alternative to Facebook that is shitty.

1463
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:26,000
So, anyway, Twitch bought Bebo.

1464
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:28,000
Well, why would Twitch want to buy a social network?

1465
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:32,000
Because, even though that's what Bebo used to do,

1466
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:35,000
what happened in July 2013, the original founders of Bebo

1467
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:39,000
bought it back from AOL for just a million dollars,

1468
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:43,000
and Bebo started focusing on game streaming and esports.

1469
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:46,000
They even offered their own version of the OBS tool,

1470
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:48,000
kind of like Streamlabs does,

1471
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:51,000
that some Twitch streamers still actually use right now.

1472
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:54,000
So, they found that streamer tournaments

1473
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:56,000
started becoming a big thing.

1474
01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:58,000
So, they actually ended up closing

1475
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:00,000
the general streaming stuff on Twitch,

1476
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:03,000
and they actually worked on their gaming events side of the business.

1477
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:07,000
So, their focus basically is streaming gaming events,

1478
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:10,000
and that is what Twitch now wants to buy because,

1479
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:14,000
and the thought is, Twitch does a lot of esports streaming,

1480
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:17,000
like I think Overwatch League is probably on right now,

1481
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:19,000
but that's not a Twitch thing.

1482
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:21,000
They just air it, right?

1483
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:23,000
I used to watch the Heroes of the Storm stuff,

1484
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:26,000
until Blizzard cancelled it, but that was all on Twitch.

1485
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:29,000
Twitch would like to have their own.

1486
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:31,000
It does have their own esports stuff,

1487
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:33,000
but I don't think it's very, very large,

1488
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:35,000
and maybe as big as they want it to be.

1489
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:39,000
So, this might be something that kind of ups their esports games,

1490
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:42,000
which, whether that's a thing you're into or not,

1491
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:45,000
is a big part of, I think, the future of Twitch and so forth,

1492
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:47,000
and just streaming online in general.

1493
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:50,000
There's probably 100,000 people watching Overwatch League right now.

1494
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:53,000
It's no small audience to laugh at.

1495
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:57,000
There you go. I just think it's interesting

1496
01:37:58,000 --> 01:37:59,000
that Bebo has that history

1497
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:01,000
of like, oh, it was a social network,

1498
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:03,000
then it was like a Twitch streaming thing,

1499
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:05,000
now it's going to be something that Twitch owns.

1500
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:09,000
So, anyway, TigerClaw in chat says, Google Buzz.

1501
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:12,000
No, it was even before that, believe it or not.

1502
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:14,000
I know Buzz. No, it was before that.

1503
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:16,000
I think it was Orkut. I really do think that was the name of it.

1504
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:18,000
Like O-R-K-U-T or something like that.

1505
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:20,000
Let's see. Nifty805 in chat,

1506
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:24,000
who I notice has a TwitchCon 2019 thing on their profile.

1507
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:26,000
I'm still sitting on the fence with that.

1508
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:28,000
I'd like to go to TwitchCon.

1509
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:31,000
I just found out one of my closest friends is moving to San Diego,

1510
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:34,000
which I'm really sad about because he's one of my closest friends.

1511
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:38,000
But, hey, I have a place to stay in San Diego.

1512
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:41,000
So, it might happen anyway.

1513
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:44,000
But Nifty805 says, Alaska 5000, come to Brazil.

1514
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:48,000
Well, there's a lot of people in Brazil, believe it or not.

1515
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:52,000
It's funny because when we talk about games,

1516
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:55,000
we really end up sometimes in this bubble

1517
01:38:55,000 --> 01:39:02,000
where the U.S., Canada, Japan, the U.K., that blob,

1518
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:06,000
the U.K., which everybody kind of sometimes assumes is just Britain,

1519
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:09,000
unless you live over there. But no, the U.K. is several countries, right?

1520
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:11,000
And that's it. Gaming doesn't exist everywhere else.

1521
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:15,000
And that's why I love that we have callers to this show,

1522
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:17,000
like Act Deaf, certainly most notably,

1523
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:20,000
who's like, hey, this is what it's really like in Mexico, right?

1524
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:22,000
And then it sometimes humbles us and reminds us,

1525
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:26,000
oh, yeah, there's gamers in all these different countries

1526
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:30,000
we don't always hear about. There's lots of gamers in Brazil.

1527
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:33,000
How often do we talk about video games in Brazil?

1528
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:35,000
Almost never.

1529
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:39,000
Yeah, exactly. So, you know, just kind of ties into that whole thing.

1530
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:41,000
All right. Anyway.

1531
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:47,000
Oh, and YYR points out, Overwatch League has only 62,000 viewers right now.

1532
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:49,000
Okay, well, I guess because it's getting later.

1533
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:52,000
Or they have to compete against Summer Games done quick right now.

1534
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:55,000
That's probably more people watching that.

1535
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:57,000
All right. Anyway.

1536
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:00,000
Okay, thank you, VidPower. VidPower went to Wikipedia

1537
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:05,000
and confirmed that Google did operate Orca as their first social media thing.

1538
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:08,000
Thank you. All right. I remembered. I don't always remember.

1539
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:10,000
Well, now we're going to remember together,

1540
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:13,000
because every week Dark Soccer likes to take us down memory lane

1541
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:17,000
with a segment she calls the Classic Game of the Week.

1542
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:19,000
And she's going to step into the gaming vault and find a game that she thinks,

1543
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:23,000
hey, you brats, check this game out.

1544
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:27,000
It's 10 years older or more and is worthy of your attention.

1545
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:29,000
And I'm going to warn you before I get the footage up here,

1546
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:33,000
it's going to go blank for a minute because I screwed up some of the preload tonight.

1547
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:35,000
So we're going to go blank for just a minute,

1548
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:38,000
but Dark Soccer is going to tell us about this week's selection.

1549
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:43,000
Well, I have to say why I picked it first is, number one, I love kind of obscure.

1550
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:52,000
Number two, it came out in June of 2002, which what else happened in June of 2002?

1551
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:56,000
Oh, I get it. OK.

1552
01:40:57,000 --> 01:40:59,000
This, you know, rabid, rabid ferret of a show.

1553
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:03,000
Yes, I love it. All right. So what is it? What is the classic game of the week?

1554
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:05,000
Shante. Shante, we stay.

1555
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:09,000
Shante, we stay. Absolutely. Which still isn't loading.

1556
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:12,000
Well, at any rate, go ahead and talk about it. I'll fix the video.

1557
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:19,000
Shante is a platforming game that was developed by WayForward and published by Capcom.

1558
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:25,000
It came out for the Game Boy Color in 2002, and it was the first game in the series.

1559
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:32,000
It did have sequels. So Shante, Risky's Revenge, Shante and the Pirate's Curse, and Shante, Half Genie Hero.

1560
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:40,000
So basically you play as a half genie named Shante who has to travel across sequin land,

1561
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:43,000
which, I don't know, take me to sequin land.

1562
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:50,000
And she has to foil the domination plans of a pirate named Risky Boots.

1563
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:52,000
Rob, I think I found my new drag name.

1564
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:54,000
Risky Boots? I like that.

1565
01:41:55,000 --> 01:42:02,000
So she learns dances as you go along and gets items that make her get stronger and unlock new abilities in different places,

1566
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:05,000
and then she can go kick Risky's ass.

1567
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:14,000
It was pretty obscure, this first one was, because it came out a year after the Game Boy Advance was already out.

1568
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:19,000
Oh. Yeah, because I was like, I don't know this first game nearly as well as I know the sequels.

1569
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:30,000
Well, at any rate, it did get very great reviews, and it's been included as one of the best games for the Game Boy Color, and even called a cult classic.

1570
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:38,000
So, as I said, it's a platform adventure game. You have to go across different areas,

1571
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:43,000
and your default attack has you using your hair like a whip,

1572
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:50,000
and you can also get gems from defeated enemies to purchase items like potions to restore your life and damaging things,

1573
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:57,000
and combat upgrades, and then you have five towns with different areas with enemies and obstacles and whatnot.

1574
01:42:57,000 --> 01:43:04,000
And so you just go around, you have all kinds of different dances that you can do that transform you into different animals,

1575
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:12,000
including a monkey that can climb on walls, a smashing elephant, a spider that climbs on webbing in the background,

1576
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:17,000
and a harpy that can fly in mid-air. And so you use those abilities to unlock other items.

1577
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:23,000
You have a day and night cycle with enemies becoming stronger at night, because what a terrible night for the curse.

1578
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:27,000
You can also collect fireflies that give you a reward for getting them off.

1579
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:38,000
You also have warp squids, which basically they let you give them to a mother squid, and then you can warp to a dungeon. So weird.

1580
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:49,000
But anyway, it's a land that was protected by genies, and then the genies had children with humans and stuff happened,

1581
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:52,000
and the genies went away, and then we have to save the world.

1582
01:43:53,000 --> 01:44:05,000
So anyway, it started development in 1997. There's even an archived version of Wayforward's page that had a different way they were planning on taking the game,

1583
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:14,000
and it was in development for PC or Playstation at the time, with 3D characters over 3D backgrounds.

1584
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:24,000
It was really going to be a different game, but then they were going then back to the idea of doing it for the SNES,

1585
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:36,000
and the developers pitched the game to Wayforward, and they basically greenlit a Game Boy Color of it, shopped around for a publisher,

1586
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:43,000
and Capcom was the one who took the chance on them, but they had them hold back the release of the game.

1587
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:48,000
And finally, though this did give them time, but when the Game Boy Advance was already out,

1588
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:54,000
they worked on making the game, even though it's a Game Boy Color game, look good on the Game Boy Advance.

1589
01:44:54,000 --> 01:45:06,000
There are no public sales figures, but hearsay is about 25,000 copies of the game were produced and sold out,

1590
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:10,000
but there was no second run, so the game is a little bit hard to find.

1591
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:18,000
They basically said that creatively they made the game a little bit too mature in brand,

1592
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:24,000
because the character was sexy or something, I don't know, she's pixels, you know, with boobs.

1593
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:33,000
But basically, you know, and also their market data was saying that female lead character won't sell, blah blah blah,

1594
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:40,000
but they were just trying to reach an audience, and the game really was received very well, IGN gave them great ratings.

1595
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:47,000
I just have to say really quick, yeah, this game, I would never have believed that this was a Game Boy Color game.

1596
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:53,000
I don't know if we're seeing, I don't know if World of the Long Plays did a video here where it's on in advance,

1597
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:57,000
so maybe we're seeing the enhancements or whatever, I would have never guessed this was a Game Boy game.

1598
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:01,000
I would have thought this was something that was on the, something that had more advanced tech,

1599
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:06,000
like that came out after Game Boy, like maybe the Lynx or the, you know, the Sega's thing or whatever.

1600
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:09,000
It looks great for Game Boy.

1601
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:15,000
And basically, the only company that gave them a bad score was Game Informer,

1602
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:22,000
because this one male reviewer said the game isn't compelling enough to keep you playing it.

1603
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:24,000
What, because it's a woman?

1604
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:31,000
I've seen that rating a lot though from Game Informer people, when a game has a female protagonist.

1605
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:34,000
I'd like to know more about that, but anyway, later.

1606
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:39,000
But it's gone on to be considered a cult classic, it's been considered,

1607
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:46,000
and although funny enough, Game Informer, another Game Informer guy, Ben Reeves, called it the 15th best Game Boy game,

1608
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:50,000
and felt that it was overlooked, so okay, maybe they're better now.

1609
01:46:51,000 --> 01:47:01,000
There were sequels, there was supposed to be a Shantae Risky Revolution for Game Boy Advance,

1610
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:04,000
or Shantae Risky Waters for the Nintendo DS.

1611
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:11,000
We had Shantae's Risky Revenge in 2009, and it was available for DSiWare.

1612
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:19,000
And they were gonna do it as an episodic, and so instead, though, they did it as a standalone sequel.

1613
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:22,000
It was ported to iOS, Windows, and PlayStation 4.

1614
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:27,000
The third one was Shantae and the Pirate's Curse that came out on the 3DS eShop,

1615
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:32,000
and then it also came out on Wii U, Windows, PS4, Xbox One, and Amazon Fire.

1616
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:43,000
And then the last one that was out was Shantae Half Genie Hero, that came out for, on Windows, PlayStation 4, Vita, Wii U,

1617
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:51,000
which I have the Wii U one, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch, and it is also the first HD game in the series.

1618
01:47:52,000 --> 01:48:03,000
It was done via crowdfunding on Kickstarter and PayPal, which doubled its original goal and went to about $950,000.

1619
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:12,000
And a fifth game is in the works, supposed to be released this year, I don't know anymore about it, it doesn't have a name,

1620
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:17,000
but it's for PC, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and Apple Arcade.

1621
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:29,000
Also, Shantae was re-released for Nintendo 3DS Virtual Console, and it apparently is still available on eShop, so you have a chance to play it.

1622
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:34,000
Is that it? Shantae, we stay.

1623
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:40,000
Alright, Shantae, you stay. It's the classic game of the week, a game as old as this show. I can't believe it. Shantae.

1624
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:42,000
Slightly older, but yeah.

1625
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:48,000
Slightly older. Oh, did the video actually finish? Alright. Good pick, good pick.

1626
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:54,000
Because again, I only know the subsequent sequels, I don't know a lot about the original, so very cool.

1627
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:56,000
Yeah, it's a good little game.

1628
01:48:57,000 --> 01:49:03,000
I have the Wii U and the 3DS versions from that Humble Bundle that they did a while back.

1629
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:11,000
YYR in chat says, I just checked and the current going price for authentic copies of this game on eBay averaged around $400.

1630
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:16,000
You can get reproductions for cheap though. Wow, that's a crazy expensive game, that's for sure.

1631
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:19,000
I think we might have one.

1632
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:21,000
Wow.

1633
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:30,000
I'll have to look, I mean, I've been trying, I'm considering actually selling some of our pricier games if someone wants to make an offer.

1634
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:32,000
Well, they gotta know what there is.

1635
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:34,000
There's the final fight guy.

1636
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:36,000
You've been trying to get rid of this for a while.

1637
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:39,000
Well, we didn't try to, I just had them sort of on the think about it list.

1638
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:44,000
Ninja Gaiden trilogy, Secret of Evermore.

1639
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:48,000
Is that considered rare? I think I have a card of that somewhere.

1640
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:50,000
Maybe.

1641
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:53,000
We have a few things, so just ask.

1642
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:55,000
Alright.

1643
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:57,000
But Dracula X isn't for sale.

1644
01:49:57,000 --> 01:50:06,000
Alright, well a little different tonight, but we don't have an in-studio break with a prior rendered video or anything like that because the project I wanted to do I wasn't able to get done.

1645
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:11,000
So we're just gonna go right into the next segment of our show and tackle some rapid fire news. Loki.

1646
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:13,000
Yeah, so there's some pretty cool stuff.

1647
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:24,000
So there's a brand new mod for Starcraft Remastered that transforms the game's look to look a little bit more like something you would see.

1648
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:29,000
I don't know, kind of like Castle Crashers or something like that.

1649
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:35,000
So it's Carbot Animations. They had a Starcraft series that he did.

1650
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:45,000
And it's basically the animations from that with all the graphics redone in the game to look like his animated series.

1651
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:50,000
And it's awesome. It's actually kind of officially blessed by Blizzard as well.

1652
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:55,000
They even unveiled it during this Korean event, but you can check it out.

1653
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:00,000
It looks pretty cool. It looks like a completely different game.

1654
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:06,000
That's very cool. I like the idea of reskinning the game. I wish Blizzard would open it up to more stuff like that.

1655
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:10,000
I guess you could do a lot with the Starcraft 2 arcade mode, but I know this is the original.

1656
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:15,000
Well, I mean, it's still the remastered, so they probably added some more of those features in there as well.

1657
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:23,000
True. All right. So this is something I think Jamie would be interested in, but apparently now they have a mod in Mass Effect 2.

1658
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:25,000
They can play in first person.

1659
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:27,000
No, thank you.

1660
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:31,000
So yes, it's a brand new PC mod that you can play in first person.

1661
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:36,000
You can't play the whole game, apparently, like that. It says the combat isn't working properly due to clipping issues.

1662
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:41,000
But everything else from walking around talking to people is in first person.

1663
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:46,000
I think the only thing that I would want is, are the cinematic scenes in that mode?

1664
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:50,000
It says most of the, yeah, everything else is in it.

1665
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:55,000
Okay, well then I have to seduce Scaris in first person, but other than that I would get so motion sick.

1666
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:59,000
Apparently he's working on mods right now for Mass Effect 1 and 3 as well.

1667
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:01,000
Nice.

1668
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:03,000
So that's it.

1669
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:15,000
All right, well let's move on to a topic I've already kind of brought up earlier in the show, but just so we all are clear, Summer Games Done Quick 2019 is underway.

1670
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:17,000
I'm very excited about this, yes.

1671
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:22,000
And I'm sure there's people that are not watching our show tonight to go watch that, which, you know, it's hard to be mad at a charity-thon.

1672
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:27,000
What game are they on right now? The schedule says they would be on Devil...

1673
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:32,000
The schedule says they'd be on Devil May Cry, but I'm not sure if that's on East Coast time.

1674
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:35,000
It should be in my local time. So they should be on about Devil May Cry right now.

1675
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:39,000
Maybe just wrapping that up and getting ready to start Streets of Rage here in a couple minutes.

1676
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:41,000
So that's pretty cool.

1677
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:46,000
So yeah, Summer Games Done Quick is going on, and I'm sure many of you guys will be watching.

1678
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:51,000
Tonight I will throw the host after OLR to Summer Games Done Quick.

1679
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:57,000
Although I'm sure, you know, I love to support the indie streamers as well, and that tends to be where we throw the host after OLR.

1680
01:52:57,000 --> 01:53:02,000
But tonight, you know, I know a lot of you guys are into that, so we'll throw it over there.

1681
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:09,000
And I always love, you know, Taskbot, or, you know, the Taskbot block and Bad Block, of course, bad game block.

1682
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:13,000
So I have to see when those are, because those are usually what I want to watch.

1683
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:18,000
Oh, and Bobby says he's auditioning to do the hosting next year, do some of the voiceovers.

1684
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:20,000
I know he was looking into doing that.

1685
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:25,000
And actually, Jason, our voiceover guy, is there right now.

1686
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:32,000
He's not doing hosting there, but he's volunteering, I guess, to learn more about the whole thing, and he's actually there at Summer Games Done Quick.

1687
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:36,000
I doubt you'll see him on the camera, because, you know, there's a lot going on at that hotel.

1688
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:41,000
But I was like, Jason, get some footage of all the other stuff at Summer Games Done Quick so we can kind of show some of that on OLR.

1689
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:48,000
So hopefully he has the time to put that together, but I know volunteering is his first focus, and we appreciate that he even had time to do an intro tonight, really.

1690
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:54,000
So, all right. And Bobby says silly games are what they call them now.

1691
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:57,000
Silly games? Silly games. Oh, silly games.

1692
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:07,000
All right. And one other quick story here from me, and that has to do with everybody was losing their bananas last week when they heard that Ubisoft was putting a new game out on the Wii.

1693
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:15,000
Just Dance 2020 is coming out of the Wii, that's not changing, but in an interview with The Telegraph over in the UK,

1694
01:54:15,000 --> 01:54:21,000
Alan Core, I hope I said his name right, said, I think we're the last soldier standing when it came to the Wii.

1695
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:26,000
We are the last game on the Wii, and we are happy about that, as there are still a lot of fans wanting to play on it.

1696
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:32,000
Now we see they are going to the Switch, and at the end of the year, Just Dance 2020 will be one of the best games on the Switch,

1697
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:36,000
because there are more and more families playing on it as it was in the Wii times.

1698
01:54:37,000 --> 01:54:44,000
But it was apparently also brought up at some point that this will be the last, that's it, this is the last game on the Wii.

1699
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:46,000
No more after this.

1700
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:53,000
I mean, they wouldn't put it on the Wii if it wasn't selling, because it costs money to produce those,

1701
01:54:54,000 --> 01:55:00,000
they have to make a version of the game for the Wii, and they have to publish it, and they have to make copies of it.

1702
01:55:01,000 --> 01:55:04,000
So if it wasn't selling, they wouldn't be putting it on that system.

1703
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:11,000
So obviously it's selling, it's just they may see the drop in sales this year because there are more people converting to the Switch,

1704
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:14,000
and that's just going to be where their focus is going to be for the Nintendo platforms.

1705
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:20,000
And, you know, to be fair, there will always be indie stuff continuing to come out on the Wii,

1706
01:55:21,000 --> 01:55:27,000
because there's always going to be a cult, if you will, I'm using that term loosely, that will develop games for consoles that have been sunsetted a long time.

1707
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:32,000
Hello, like Halo 2600. People still develop for the Atari 2600, you know what I mean?

1708
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:38,000
So there's going to be people that still develop for the Wii, but this will be the last commercial release, certainly probably for the Wii.

1709
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:43,000
Unless, I say probably because I guess you never know what will happen, but most likely.

1710
01:55:43,000 --> 01:55:49,000
Alright, anyhow, VidPower says shoutouts to the Wii U, the best way to play Wii games.

1711
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:55,000
And I said that last week is that I don't know if it's a Wii release as much as it is, oh it's a Wii U release as well.

1712
01:55:56,000 --> 01:56:02,000
But yeah, I think the executive is right in the comment there that most people at this point are converting to the Switch if they haven't already.

1713
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:06,000
You might have some people that are holding off on those rumors about a souped up Switch or a Switch Mini.

1714
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:17,000
We don't have that on our show tonight, but I realize there's a lot of rumors from like, not hardware makers, peripheral accessories, makers of accessories.

1715
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:23,000
Apparently there is a Switch Mini thing that's leaking, but we'll wait and see what comes of that.

1716
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:25,000
We'll wait and see what Nintendo has to say about that.

1717
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:27,000
Alright, Dark Sakura, I know you have a couple quick things for us.

1718
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:32,000
I do. It's actually having to do with the Breath of the Wild sequel.

1719
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:50,000
Aonuma Eiji basically had said in an interview that they wanted to do more DLC for Breath of the Wild and had so many different ideas and so many changes that they were like, nope, DLC ain't gonna cut it, we need to make this a sequel.

1720
01:56:51,000 --> 01:56:57,000
And so, because they had so many ideas for DLC, they just thought this would work good as its own game.

1721
01:56:57,000 --> 01:57:03,000
And so I'm pretty excited about that, and I still very much would hope we get to play as Zelda.

1722
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:06,000
I mean, there's hints there.

1723
01:57:07,000 --> 01:57:19,000
But anyway, moving on from that, of course, and Bobby already talked about this, but Tesla Arcade is a thing where you can play video games in your Tesla.

1724
01:57:19,000 --> 01:57:24,000
You can also use the steering wheel, which is moving your tires.

1725
01:57:25,000 --> 01:57:27,000
And Bobby said they're expensive.

1726
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:33,000
Aspessa tires, which we know about from Dan's Mustang as well, because they're special tires.

1727
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:38,000
But you can play with the wheel in your car to play the game.

1728
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:46,000
And you know, you can brake with the brake pedal in your car. You can't accelerate because it's already accelerating.

1729
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:49,000
It's on this one game, Beach Buggy Racing 2.

1730
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:52,000
But yeah, you can use your car.

1731
01:57:53,000 --> 01:57:57,000
We've all seen those videos of cars crashing into stores or whatever.

1732
01:57:58,000 --> 01:58:02,000
We've all seen those videos, and nobody wants that to be them in their Teslas.

1733
01:58:03,000 --> 01:58:05,000
That's why they don't let you use the gas pedal.

1734
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:11,000
But there you go. Drive virtual car with real car.

1735
01:58:11,000 --> 01:58:16,000
I will say Bobby went in a little in depth on his show on this topic if you want to hear more.

1736
01:58:17,000 --> 01:58:24,000
Because I thought he made a very good point about how you with the turning of the wheel and the tires, you probably don't want to do a lot of that while you're parked.

1737
01:58:25,000 --> 01:58:27,000
So this is really a novelty like show off thing.

1738
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:30,000
But this is not the way you're going to game long term.

1739
01:58:31,000 --> 01:58:33,000
Put your car on the lift first and then do it.

1740
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:36,000
Yeah, put a car up on a lift first and then do it.

1741
01:58:37,000 --> 01:58:42,000
But you know what, so is that. Now I remember Bobby showed me this when I was visiting last.

1742
01:58:43,000 --> 01:58:45,000
The way that they do like Rainbow Road and so forth in there.

1743
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:48,000
And it's one of those things, oh it's cute. You show it off to your friends.

1744
01:58:49,000 --> 01:58:51,000
Haha, that's funny. And then you don't really ever do it again.

1745
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:56,000
Anyway, Bobby says I can play other games in my Tesla but not the new high end stuff.

1746
01:58:57,000 --> 01:59:00,000
I have some of the Atari games on mine like Asteroids and Centipede.

1747
01:59:01,000 --> 01:59:02,000
Yeah, that's pretty cool that they have the.

1748
01:59:03,000 --> 01:59:05,000
But it's interesting how Tesla wants to do all this gaming stuff.

1749
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:09,000
Okay, for something that's supposed to be an aw that's cute moment.

1750
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:12,000
It's like alright, this is, how long is this going to go?

1751
01:59:13,000 --> 01:59:16,000
But maybe, I don't know, maybe they, it is, I don't know about the turning the wheel in place.

1752
01:59:17,000 --> 01:59:19,000
But like you know if you can play with the touch pad, play classics and stuff.

1753
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:22,000
It is something to do while the car is charging.

1754
01:59:23,000 --> 01:59:26,000
Because you know that may be something that you're not used to is waiting for the car to charge.

1755
01:59:27,000 --> 01:59:28,000
Which might take a little longer than fueling up.

1756
01:59:29,000 --> 01:59:31,000
But that's why they put those car chargers at shopping malls.

1757
01:59:31,000 --> 01:59:36,000
And you know, elaborate travel stops in places where it's very easy to kill a lot of time.

1758
01:59:37,000 --> 01:59:39,000
So, anyway. Alright, we'll move on.

1759
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:42,000
Let's talk about world release dates.

1760
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:46,000
Travel around the world and check out what is coming out in a store near you. Loki.

1761
01:59:47,000 --> 01:59:51,000
Alright, so this week we've got, looks like Heavy Rain coming out on PC.

1762
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:56,000
Bloodstained Ritual of the Night, the Switch version is going to be coming up as well.

1763
01:59:56,000 --> 02:00:01,000
Devil May Cry on Nintendo Switch. Judgment on PlayStation 4.

1764
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:05,000
Samurai Showdown on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

1765
02:00:06,000 --> 02:00:10,000
Super Netunia RPG on Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4.

1766
02:00:11,000 --> 02:00:13,000
MotoGP 19 on Nintendo Switch.

1767
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:17,000
The Sinking City on PC, PlayStation 4, Xbox One.

1768
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:21,000
F1 2019 on PC, PlayStation 4, Xbox One.

1769
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:25,000
And last but not least, Super Mario Maker 2.

1770
02:00:26,000 --> 02:00:28,000
On the Switch. Awesome. Yep.

1771
02:00:29,000 --> 02:00:31,000
Excited about that, that's for sure. I can't wait to get that.

1772
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:35,000
Alright, moving on and talking about what's coming out in Japan.

1773
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:40,000
On Japan we have Samurai Showdown, is released on June 27th on the PlayStation 4.

1774
02:00:41,000 --> 02:00:45,000
A game called Kono Subarashi Sekai ni Suyukufuku.

1775
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:47,000
This wonderful world something.

1776
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:53,000
Is coming out. And then, Dark Tetsuya, La Mulana 2 gets its Japanese release this week.

1777
02:00:53,000 --> 02:00:55,000
I think that's already out here.

1778
02:00:56,000 --> 02:00:58,000
Or on the Switch or something.

1779
02:00:59,000 --> 02:01:04,000
And then that same Kono Subarashi game is coming out in a regular and limited edition.

1780
02:01:05,000 --> 02:01:07,000
Also a game called To All of Mankind.

1781
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:12,000
I don't know if that sounds like a letter somebody writes before they do something terrible.

1782
02:01:13,000 --> 02:01:15,000
But it actually looks like it's based on anime.

1783
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:21,000
The game called To All of Mankind is a bunch of anime girls walking across a crosswalk like they're the Beatles.

1784
02:01:21,000 --> 02:01:25,000
So I don't... Alright. That's that game.

1785
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:31,000
Then looking at the Nintendo Switch this week. What do we have? Puyo Puyo Esports.

1786
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:36,000
That's a thing? Competitive Puyo Puyo? Yeah, Puyo Puyo Esports.

1787
02:01:37,000 --> 02:01:38,000
Only 20 bucks.

1788
02:01:39,000 --> 02:01:40,000
Wow.

1789
02:01:41,000 --> 02:01:43,000
It looks like it might be a sports themed Puyo Puyo game.

1790
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:46,000
That's what I'm getting from the screenshots. That's kinda cool.

1791
02:01:47,000 --> 02:01:50,000
Alright, other games coming out on the Switch in Japan this week.

1792
02:01:51,000 --> 02:01:54,000
No, that's it. Sorry. Oh no, I looked the wrong way.

1793
02:01:55,000 --> 02:01:57,000
La Mulana 2 is on the Switch this week as well.

1794
02:01:58,000 --> 02:02:05,000
And To All of Mankind also gets its release in Japan as well as Bloodstained on the Switch in Japan this week.

1795
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:08,000
How about the UK, DarkSakura?

1796
02:02:09,000 --> 02:02:10,000
There's some stuff.

1797
02:02:11,000 --> 02:02:14,000
So we have Samurai Showdown on the 24th.

1798
02:02:15,000 --> 02:02:19,000
Also on the 24th, Car Mechanic Simulator, Monster Jam Steel Titans.

1799
02:02:19,000 --> 02:02:28,000
We have Kingdom Come Deliverance Royal Collectors Edition, Judgment, F1 2019 Legends Edition.

1800
02:02:29,000 --> 02:02:34,000
On the 26th, we have The Sinking City, MotoGP 19.

1801
02:02:35,000 --> 02:02:48,000
On the 27th, Death Gambit, Super Mario Maker 2, QUI VR, Hollow Knight, F1 2019 Anniversary Edition.

1802
02:02:49,000 --> 02:02:52,000
That's it. Awesome. Alright.

1803
02:02:53,000 --> 02:02:56,000
Should I go up through July because we won't be here, will we?

1804
02:02:57,000 --> 02:03:04,000
No, you won't be here next week. I think we are having a show next week. It'll probably be a short show.

1805
02:03:05,000 --> 02:03:07,000
Because I'll be coming back from Reno that morning.

1806
02:03:07,000 --> 02:03:18,000
So my birthday is next week. And as a present to myself, I bought some time ago VIP tickets, meaning I get to meet and greet.

1807
02:03:19,000 --> 02:03:29,000
And I'm so excited I could cry. Carly Rae Jepsen, or as we call her, as my people call her, Carly Slay Jeezipsen is playing at the Grand Sierra in Reno.

1808
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:34,000
And so we have meet and greet tickets and I'm so excited. I'm like, I'm gonna cry. It's gonna be so much fun.

1809
02:03:34,000 --> 02:03:38,000
So, Loki, you look like you're about to make fun of me in a massive way. I don't even care.

1810
02:03:39,000 --> 02:03:43,000
I can't make fun of you because I have no idea what any of that you just said was.

1811
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:46,000
Do you remember that song, Call Me Baby? That was her.

1812
02:03:47,000 --> 02:03:54,000
But if you all were to stream Emotion, which you absolutely should do, as well as her new album, you should stream all of Carly Rae Jepsen.

1813
02:03:55,000 --> 02:03:59,000
She's got a lot of great bops. That's what the kids say. A lot of bops.

1814
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:03,000
Don't use anything that the kids would say anymore.

1815
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:05,000
No one says that, Rob.

1816
02:04:06,000 --> 02:04:09,000
I will be coming back from seeing Carly Slay the night before.

1817
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:11,000
I'm judging you so hard right now.

1818
02:04:12,000 --> 02:04:13,000
I don't give a fuck.

1819
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:15,000
If you were going to see Britney, I would be...

1820
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:18,000
What is wrong with Carly Rae Jepsen?

1821
02:04:19,000 --> 02:04:21,000
Nothing's wrong with her, but she's not Britney.

1822
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:25,000
Anyway.

1823
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:27,000
She is not Britney.

1824
02:04:28,000 --> 02:04:32,000
Thank you, Vid Power, who says, I attended a Carly Rae Jepsen concert once. She's great.

1825
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:35,000
Thank you. Thank you. Alright.

1826
02:04:36,000 --> 02:04:37,000
She's not Britney.

1827
02:04:38,000 --> 02:04:44,000
Let's move on. Our mailbag. Every week you guys send us emails to participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

1828
02:04:45,000 --> 02:04:46,000
Is she iCarly?

1829
02:04:47,000 --> 02:04:48,000
Bobby Black Wolf. She is not iCarly.

1830
02:04:49,000 --> 02:04:50,000
I found iCarly toys at the thrift store and I cried.

1831
02:04:51,000 --> 02:04:53,000
Bobby Black Wolf says, she's Carly, bitch.

1832
02:04:56,000 --> 02:04:59,000
I did not expect Bobby Black Wolf of all people to make that joke.

1833
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:01,000
Well played. Well played.

1834
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:04,000
Thank you, DPO. Alright, moving on. Let's get to the mailbag.

1835
02:05:05,000 --> 02:05:07,000
Every week you guys send us emails. Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

1836
02:05:08,000 --> 02:05:09,000
And we read them.

1837
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:15,000
Except sometimes your host in his advancing age and DarkSakura not being here misses one.

1838
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:17,000
And I think that's what happened with this email.

1839
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:19,000
Advanced age my ass.

1840
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:21,000
DarkSakura is about to read.

1841
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:23,000
I've done been there.

1842
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:27,000
And this is from YYR. So yes, we did get the email.

1843
02:05:27,000 --> 02:05:32,000
It's just someone wasn't here and someone farted and someone...

1844
02:05:33,000 --> 02:05:35,000
I literally don't have a reason.

1845
02:05:36,000 --> 02:05:38,000
Rob is a shrug emoji.

1846
02:05:39,000 --> 02:05:42,000
Obviously I would not ignore or overlook his email.

1847
02:05:43,000 --> 02:05:46,000
Rob is shrug emoji right now. Shrug emoji.

1848
02:05:47,000 --> 02:05:51,000
So hello LR. Just a couple of thoughts on last week's pre-E3 and E3 coverage.

1849
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:55,000
On the subject of Forza Horizon's four second expansion announcement,

1850
02:05:55,000 --> 02:06:00,000
Rob remarked that the Lego Speed expansion very well could have been made into its own game.

1851
02:06:01,000 --> 02:06:04,000
And that he felt the same about Forza Horizon's three Hot Wheels expansion.

1852
02:06:05,000 --> 02:06:08,000
There's an important distinction to be made here for a full game and a DLC expansion.

1853
02:06:09,000 --> 02:06:15,000
If these had been full games and you're a Game Pass subscriber, you'd be able to play them for no additional cost.

1854
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:20,000
But because these are DLC expansions, they cost money to play and you don't get them for quote free.

1855
02:06:20,000 --> 02:06:29,000
And on top of this, if you decide to buy the DLC and let your Game Pass subscription expire, you may wind up owning DLC you can't use unless you turn around and buy the game.

1856
02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:37,000
So I think these are deliberate thought out moves and that they know exactly what they're doing by making these DLC and not full games.

1857
02:06:38,000 --> 02:06:44,000
It's a truly modern business model that seems extremely user friendly but under the surface is just a wee bit devious.

1858
02:06:45,000 --> 02:06:46,000
I still want a full game. I don't care.

1859
02:06:47,000 --> 02:06:59,000
Yeah, no. I definitely think there's some truth to what YYR is saying, especially in regards to they like to give you these games with the Game Passes because then they can still make a buck off DLC.

1860
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:02,000
Sometimes they include the DLC in the past, most of the time they don't.

1861
02:07:03,000 --> 02:07:08,000
They still sell the games because with that argument, Xbox is just not publishing anymore games because they're just going to include them all in Game Pass.

1862
02:07:09,000 --> 02:07:12,000
They still sell the games because the Game Pass hasn't taken over yet.

1863
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:15,000
So I mean, full game please.

1864
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:22,000
Okay, but it's just like, we just want to see this idea as a full game.

1865
02:07:23,000 --> 02:07:30,000
But to be fair, Bobby played the DLC. I haven't yet. And when I was listening to his show, he said, I kind of get why it's not its own game.

1866
02:07:31,000 --> 02:07:36,000
But that doesn't mean we don't want to see the idea of a Lego Forza thing thought as realized.

1867
02:07:36,000 --> 02:07:44,000
Yeah, bigger. Obviously, yes, it's not going to be a full-fledged game in the DLC, but I would like a full-fledged game in the DLC.

1868
02:07:45,000 --> 02:07:50,000
Bobby says it is definitely a DLC, not a full-fledged game. It's just Forza Horizon 4 with the Lego skin.

1869
02:07:51,000 --> 02:07:57,000
I'm fine with that. I'm completely fine with that. I'm fine with also the Hot Wheels expansion as its own game.

1870
02:07:58,000 --> 02:07:59,000
Anyway, I'll get to it at this point, but moving on.

1871
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:04,000
So now as far as Google Stadia, my question is, who is it for? What is their intended audience?

1872
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:10,000
If you look at the launch lineup, it contains very few exclusives. Good use of a semi-colon there.

1873
02:08:11,000 --> 02:08:14,000
No, I love reading YYRs letters. They're beautiful.

1874
02:08:15,000 --> 02:08:22,000
Most of the announced games are either previously released AAA titles spanning the last few years or new AAA titles that are also releasing on established platforms.

1875
02:08:23,000 --> 02:08:27,000
In this way, the Stadia launch lineup looks suspiciously familiar to that of Wii U.

1876
02:08:27,000 --> 02:08:33,000
The timing of Stadia is questionable also. Completely ignoring the technology, let's get this fact straight.

1877
02:08:34,000 --> 02:08:38,000
Stadia is launching with games that can be played on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

1878
02:08:39,000 --> 02:08:45,000
If you want to play a AAA console game, you probably own one or both of these by now.

1879
02:08:46,000 --> 02:08:51,000
After all, you've had almost six years to buy them. So who exactly is rushing to throw money at Stadia?

1880
02:08:52,000 --> 02:08:55,000
The timing seems even more questionable when you consider this.

1881
02:08:56,000 --> 02:09:06,000
Microsoft and Sony are launching their new consoles next year to audiences that have built up financial investments and brand loyalty over many years with exclusive games that will never launch on Stadia.

1882
02:09:07,000 --> 02:09:16,000
So yeah, without even considering potential technical issues or Google's track record regarding the life of their services, I'm really confused as to who the intended audience of Stadia is.

1883
02:09:16,000 --> 02:09:27,000
I just know that I'm not a part of it. Thanks again for the show and have a great week. Warm, moist hugs, Aaron Yyr. Moist.

1884
02:09:28,000 --> 02:09:29,000
How do you feel about that word?

1885
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:31,000
I don't care, but we have a friend who hates it.

1886
02:09:32,000 --> 02:09:35,000
I know some people are not fans of that, but anyway. Alright, well...

1887
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:37,000
I have other words that I don't like.

1888
02:09:38,000 --> 02:09:39,000
Such as?

1889
02:09:40,000 --> 02:09:45,000
I hate being called hun. Hate it. Like, with an unholy passion. I'm like, just finish the word.

1890
02:09:46,000 --> 02:09:47,000
Oh, honey.

1891
02:09:48,000 --> 02:09:49,000
Oh, honey.

1892
02:09:50,000 --> 02:09:56,000
Alright. But anyway, Bobby in chat responds to that saying, the intended audience are people who don't want to buy a high-end PC.

1893
02:09:57,000 --> 02:10:01,000
People who don't want to buy a console since this runs on phones and Chromebooks.

1894
02:10:02,000 --> 02:10:04,000
And then Bobby, excuse me, Yyr kind of follows that up saying, at Bobby.

1895
02:10:05,000 --> 02:10:08,000
But if you don't want to buy a console, it's probably because you don't want to buy console games.

1896
02:10:09,000 --> 02:10:14,000
Bobby replies saying, I know many people who would love to play console games who don't want to spend money on a console and plug it into their TV.

1897
02:10:14,000 --> 02:10:21,000
I think you're kind of both right. Here's why. Bobby says it's for people who don't want to buy that stuff.

1898
02:10:22,000 --> 02:10:24,000
And yes, that's what Stadia is trying to do. It's consoles as a service.

1899
02:10:25,000 --> 02:10:27,000
It's trying to take the console, and I'm including high-end PC as a console here.

1900
02:10:28,000 --> 02:10:30,000
And it's trying to like basically instead sell that essentially as a service.

1901
02:10:31,000 --> 02:10:35,000
Although we know the low end of it will be free, but it is still a service, right?

1902
02:10:36,000 --> 02:10:39,000
But then Yyr said flat out in his email, I just know it's not for me.

1903
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:41,000
And I think that can also be true.

1904
02:10:41,000 --> 02:10:49,000
And so, yeah, I'm still of the mindset that, and certainly I also recognize, well, Google Stadia definitely isn't for me.

1905
02:10:50,000 --> 02:10:52,000
Because I do buy the high-end PCs and the consoles and stuff like that.

1906
02:10:53,000 --> 02:10:59,000
But maybe there are people who would buy them on being able to stream something like Assassin's Creed to their phone.

1907
02:11:00,000 --> 02:11:02,000
I just don't think a phone is a fun way to play Assassin's Creed.

1908
02:11:03,000 --> 02:11:09,000
But we know that Apple just made a big to-do, and you probably already do this on Android about using Bluetooth controllers on their devices.

1909
02:11:09,000 --> 02:11:16,000
Yeah, I was thinking, you know, maybe like, you know, the draw is like smart TV owners.

1910
02:11:17,000 --> 02:11:25,000
Because I know with our TV that we got last year, you know, there's a lot of different apps that are built in and stuff.

1911
02:11:26,000 --> 02:11:28,000
So you could do like, you know, Hulu and Netflix and that kind of stuff.

1912
02:11:29,000 --> 02:11:31,000
And this is like another, oh hey, I can play games on this too.

1913
02:11:32,000 --> 02:11:37,000
The only thing with that though is with Stadia, you've got to have either a Bluetooth game controller,

1914
02:11:37,000 --> 02:11:41,000
or their preferred, you know, Stadia controller, which is like 100 bucks.

1915
02:11:42,000 --> 02:11:45,000
Or, I think, no, it's less than 100 bucks, but it's still expensive.

1916
02:11:46,000 --> 02:11:48,000
You know, it's not just like, I can play it out of the box type of thing.

1917
02:11:49,000 --> 02:11:52,000
So, I don't know. I don't know who it's for.

1918
02:11:53,000 --> 02:11:57,000
And I think really with the bandwidth caps that are in place now with most internet services,

1919
02:11:58,000 --> 02:12:00,000
it is going to be a hard sell for that.

1920
02:12:01,000 --> 02:12:02,000
Because it's like, well, why do I need to do this?

1921
02:12:02,000 --> 02:12:10,000
Maybe later on when like technology gets even better and, you know, they're able to stream games with better quality graphics and stuff like that,

1922
02:12:11,000 --> 02:12:13,000
there might be more of a value proposition there.

1923
02:12:14,000 --> 02:12:16,000
But right now, yeah, I don't know who it's for.

1924
02:12:17,000 --> 02:12:23,000
I think there might be something to say about people in other countries that may not have the easy access to consoles.

1925
02:12:24,000 --> 02:12:25,000
I know we talked about Brazil earlier randomly.

1926
02:12:26,000 --> 02:12:31,000
But of course, of course, now before you say it, Brazil is going to have to have the internet infrastructure to support it.

1927
02:12:32,000 --> 02:12:33,000
But I imagine some of their larger cities do.

1928
02:12:34,000 --> 02:12:39,000
But I'm just saying there might be places where it's not so easy to just get these consoles and higher parts because of import taxes and all this other stuff.

1929
02:12:40,000 --> 02:12:42,000
So, Stadia might actually be a more cost effective option.

1930
02:12:43,000 --> 02:12:44,000
If they have the internet.

1931
02:12:45,000 --> 02:12:46,000
But they're not even launching in those countries.

1932
02:12:47,000 --> 02:12:49,000
So, that's the other thing is it's not being launched there.

1933
02:12:50,000 --> 02:12:51,000
Yet.

1934
02:12:52,000 --> 02:12:54,000
Yet. I understand that. But, I don't know.

1935
02:12:55,000 --> 02:12:58,000
I just, I think there's just other ways that would be better.

1936
02:12:59,000 --> 02:13:00,000
Like PC gaming or...

1937
02:13:00,000 --> 02:13:05,000
I just, I just think, although, yes, it's certainly for a casual audience.

1938
02:13:06,000 --> 02:13:16,000
I think the reality is the bandwidth issues and concerns that come with that are going to really, like, once a casual kind of hears about how much of their internet is going to get eaten with it.

1939
02:13:17,000 --> 02:13:18,000
And that if they just play Stadia a lot, they can't really use Netflix or anything.

1940
02:13:19,000 --> 02:13:20,000
I think they'll kind of be turned off to it.

1941
02:13:21,000 --> 02:13:26,000
Yeah. I think once we see, we're going to have to see like what the actual numbers are as far as like how much data it's using in a given month.

1942
02:13:26,000 --> 02:13:36,000
You know, and I'm sure those articles are going to come out like once the services launch or like, you know, issues with running that while you're doing, you know, streaming on another thing.

1943
02:13:37,000 --> 02:13:42,000
Or what if, what if I want to play Stadia and someone else in my family wants to play Stadia at the same time?

1944
02:13:43,000 --> 02:13:44,000
And it's like, oh, can't do that.

1945
02:13:45,000 --> 02:13:50,000
Here's, and YYR is saying in chat, like I'm trying to follow the logic where someone might say this product is for me and I'm just not seeing it.

1946
02:13:51,000 --> 02:13:53,000
Let me give you one other example I could think of because I know I would have used it in this circumstance.

1947
02:13:53,000 --> 02:14:03,000
If I was a college kid who couldn't afford to get my own console because I'm trying to put myself through school, but I still want to be able to play video games on a Saturday night and I'm going to use my school internet.

1948
02:14:04,000 --> 02:14:10,000
And I would too, to play maybe the free version of Stadia and maybe have a couple of games on it or, you know, some of the free to play stuff.

1949
02:14:11,000 --> 02:14:12,000
Maybe I know I'm reaching a little.

1950
02:14:13,000 --> 02:14:14,000
But I think the audience will show itself.

1951
02:14:15,000 --> 02:14:16,000
Let's go with that. Okay. So I'm an average college kid.

1952
02:14:17,000 --> 02:14:19,000
I'm probably going to have a computer because I'm going to college.

1953
02:14:20,000 --> 02:14:21,000
Granted, it's not going to be the most powerful computer out there.

1954
02:14:21,000 --> 02:14:25,000
But it's something that should be able to play, you would say, most of the esports style.

1955
02:14:26,000 --> 02:14:32,000
So there's your Fortnite. There's your, you know, I don't know if that would play PUBG or whatever, but at least Fortnite, probably Overwatch.

1956
02:14:33,000 --> 02:14:34,000
You throw some Minecraft in there and stuff.

1957
02:14:35,000 --> 02:14:40,000
So you're still able to play some games and some basic games, maybe even on lower settings or whatever.

1958
02:14:41,000 --> 02:14:50,000
If you really want a console game, I mean, you probably have a console or if you don't have a console, you could get like a last gen console for very cheap and get the games for even cheaper.

1959
02:14:51,000 --> 02:14:54,000
There's lots of options out there.

1960
02:14:55,000 --> 02:14:58,000
And also if you're in college, you probably don't have a lot of time to be doing gaming and stuff.

1961
02:14:59,000 --> 02:15:05,000
But I just don't know where like college internet would not handle that crap at all.

1962
02:15:06,000 --> 02:15:08,000
I'm sorry. That's just not going to be a viable option.

1963
02:15:09,000 --> 02:15:11,000
But there's still lots of things out there.

1964
02:15:12,000 --> 02:15:17,000
And I get it that I think Google's thinking, well, hey, we can sell our Chromebooks.

1965
02:15:17,000 --> 02:15:24,000
And even though the specs on them kind of suck for everything other than just basic internet browsing, you can kind of game on them with this.

1966
02:15:25,000 --> 02:15:33,000
But it's kind of solving a problem that doesn't really need to be solved with a Chromebook because people that buy Chromebooks aren't buying them to game on anyways.

1967
02:15:34,000 --> 02:15:38,000
And no one's going to look at that and go, oh, now I can game on. I'm totally, but no, that's not going to happen.

1968
02:15:39,000 --> 02:15:44,000
So I don't know. I don't know who it's for and that's not really my problem to solve and it doesn't affect me in any way. So who cares?

1969
02:15:44,000 --> 02:15:52,000
All right. I will see. I still think some of this, like the bandwidth and stuff is just going to really be the killer issue.

1970
02:15:53,000 --> 02:15:56,000
But we'll see as this develops. Was there anything else to the email?

1971
02:15:57,000 --> 02:15:58,000
No, that was it.

1972
02:15:59,000 --> 02:16:01,000
All right. Well, thank you YYR and sorry it took us a week to get there.

1973
02:16:02,000 --> 02:16:09,000
All right. So let's invite more emails next time. Participate at orangeonshreddy.com. I promise I'll do better and not try to overlook them next time.

1974
02:16:09,000 --> 02:16:14,000
All right. Meanwhile, we have just a few more stories before we open up the Skype line for some calls.

1975
02:16:15,000 --> 02:16:21,000
We're running longer than I would have thought, especially not taking a break tonight. So it'll be short the time for calls tonight if you want to get in.

1976
02:16:22,000 --> 02:16:23,000
So be sure to be there in the green room. Loki.

1977
02:16:24,000 --> 02:16:38,000
So there was this game that was made out there, a fan game called Mario Royale, which was basically a 75 person death race through Mario's first few levels.

1978
02:16:39,000 --> 02:16:43,000
So you start off and everybody's kind of racing towards the finish and the first three that gets their wins.

1979
02:16:44,000 --> 02:16:51,000
It's kind of neat the way you can actually see all the different Mario's jumping around kind of reminded me a little bit of some of the other games that they have there.

1980
02:16:52,000 --> 02:16:57,000
There was like, God, I can't remember the racing game now, but there's several games out there that have like that kind of feature.

1981
02:16:58,000 --> 02:17:01,000
Of course, it got taken down or cease and desist by Nintendo.

1982
02:17:01,000 --> 02:17:13,000
Now it's under a different moniker now and they've made it very generic as far as the graphics and stuff go, but same type of gameplay.

1983
02:17:14,000 --> 02:17:20,000
It's a neat idea. This is something I could see them doing almost with like, you know, the whole Nintendo online stuff.

1984
02:17:21,000 --> 02:17:27,000
You know, kind of a race type game or something like that. I could see them definitely adapting something like that.

1985
02:17:27,000 --> 02:17:35,000
But right now, I mean, come on, you knew this shit was going to get taken down, but I guess we'll just have to...

1986
02:17:36,000 --> 02:17:37,000
Well, it's already on the internet though, so...

1987
02:17:38,000 --> 02:17:42,000
Well, no, it's already on the internet, but it had to be taken down. So now it's something else.

1988
02:17:43,000 --> 02:17:47,000
Somebody else will have it up in moments, I'm sure. Anyway.

1989
02:17:48,000 --> 02:17:53,000
But neat. I mean, I just, I don't know. I didn't get to play it when it was Mario.

1990
02:17:53,000 --> 02:17:58,000
But people are watching it on YouTube and stuff, or people have it on YouTube and stuff, right? So you can kind of see it in action?

1991
02:17:59,000 --> 02:18:05,000
Yeah. So at least you can watch it and you can dream of what might have been, I suppose.

1992
02:18:06,000 --> 02:18:12,000
Yeah. I mean, it looks like a neat idea and I still wish they would do something like that with Nintendo online.

1993
02:18:13,000 --> 02:18:16,000
Because they've got, you know, one game that they put out on it and they're...

1994
02:18:17,000 --> 02:18:19,000
Maybe that's why they shut it down, is that Mario...

1995
02:18:20,000 --> 02:18:22,000
No, I think it's because it was just infringing on their IP.

1996
02:18:23,000 --> 02:18:29,000
Not because it's like, oh, you took our idea, dammit! No, I think it's their IP.

1997
02:18:30,000 --> 02:18:36,000
Yeah, so they've got the version now without the Nintendo sprites in there.

1998
02:18:37,000 --> 02:18:42,000
And I want to say that, I don't know if the levels are still the same, but it looks very generic now.

1999
02:18:43,000 --> 02:18:45,000
But, I mean, I don't know. It's neat.

2000
02:18:45,000 --> 02:18:54,000
It's almost like that other game. I don't remember what it was called now, but it was the other Mario game where you could play as the non-Mario characters as well.

2001
02:18:55,000 --> 02:19:02,000
Like they had Metroid characters, they had Legends, all this stuff. There was Blaster Master in there.

2002
02:19:03,000 --> 02:19:05,000
I don't remember the hell that game was called, but it was...

2003
02:19:06,000 --> 02:19:09,000
And it was done here by a guy in SAC, too, because they went to Kickstarter with it, didn't they?

2004
02:19:10,000 --> 02:19:13,000
Yes, he went to Kickstarter for a generic version of it.

2005
02:19:13,000 --> 02:19:15,000
Like Super Mario crossover. Thank you, chatters.

2006
02:19:16,000 --> 02:19:18,000
Yeah, never got finished, unfortunately.

2007
02:19:19,000 --> 02:19:25,000
But yeah, then on the Kickstarter, it was like all the Marios and that were gone and replaced with just analogies.

2008
02:19:26,000 --> 02:19:27,000
Lookalikes.

2009
02:19:28,000 --> 02:19:29,000
B-movie knockoffs.

2010
02:19:30,000 --> 02:19:32,000
Oh, as Joe and her master, the Kickstarter failed. That's too bad.

2011
02:19:33,000 --> 02:19:39,000
It's hard on Kickstarter now, you guys, because there's been so many horror stories about people not getting their goods and stuff.

2012
02:19:40,000 --> 02:19:42,000
People really choose what they are and aren't going to back very carefully.

2013
02:19:43,000 --> 02:19:49,000
Yeah, I mean, I did that Amstream thing recently, but that's because they were already showing, basically, a finished product.

2014
02:19:50,000 --> 02:19:57,000
And they already said, we have these licenses, and this money is to kind of get us that push to get out the door or run in, basically.

2015
02:19:58,000 --> 02:20:00,000
And probably to sell some early subscriptions and stuff.

2016
02:20:01,000 --> 02:20:04,000
But that was why I backed it, was because they were pretty much already showing something that was finished.

2017
02:20:05,000 --> 02:20:07,000
That's the only way I would ever do a Kickstarter like that.

2018
02:20:08,000 --> 02:20:10,000
Yeah, and I think I have a finished product in mind.

2019
02:20:10,000 --> 02:20:17,000
Exactly. I think things that do things like that have a better chance of succeeding than, like, I have an idea.

2020
02:20:18,000 --> 02:20:25,000
Well, I mean, it's great that Bloodstained is doing so well, and especially, you know, Darkstalker is receiving it as well as she is, and hopefully I do too.

2021
02:20:26,000 --> 02:20:28,000
Because, like, I kickstarted that thing, like, four years ago, you know?

2022
02:20:29,000 --> 02:20:30,000
Yeah, that's the other thing.

2023
02:20:31,000 --> 02:20:35,000
But I am, no, at the end of the day, I'm happy that we get a game like it and that it seems to have been worth the wait.

2024
02:20:35,000 --> 02:20:39,000
Alright, anyway, let me get to this story, which is about Anthem.

2025
02:20:40,000 --> 02:20:50,000
That's right, EA, you know, some people would wonder why they haven't pulled the servers by now on Anthem, because usually that, I'm not saying that to, like, knock on Anthem, but that's just the EA thing to do, it seems, usually.

2026
02:20:51,000 --> 02:21:01,000
But EA did a big interview with Game Daily, Andrew Wilson, the CEO of EA, basically said that bringing two subsets of players to the game was an issue.

2027
02:21:01,000 --> 02:21:07,000
We brought together these two groups of players who were making this emotional value calculation on two different vectors.

2028
02:21:08,000 --> 02:21:12,000
One was traditional BioWare story-driven content, and the other was this action-adventure type content.

2029
02:21:13,000 --> 02:21:17,000
About the 30 or 40 hour mark, they really had to come together and start working in on the elder game.

2030
02:21:18,000 --> 02:21:22,000
At that point, everyone kind of went, oh, hang a minute, now the calculation is off.

2031
02:21:23,000 --> 02:21:28,000
It's off because I've got a friend who sits in this other category of player, they want to play the game a certain way, I want to play the game a certain way.

2032
02:21:28,000 --> 02:21:31,000
The promise was we can play together, and that's not working very well.

2033
02:21:32,000 --> 02:21:40,000
So he just kind of goes on to say that these two didn't mix or whatever, but he says, the world is compelling enough to continue investing in the game, basically.

2034
02:21:41,000 --> 02:21:47,000
Quote, the teams at BioWare will continue to come to work every day and listen to the players, old and new, and seek to deliver on the promises they've made to those players.

2035
02:21:48,000 --> 02:21:49,000
That's what you're seeing with Anthem today.

2036
02:21:49,000 --> 02:22:00,000
Here's the thing. A game can turn around. Diablo 3, excellent example. Final Fantasy XIV, wonderful example. No Man's Sky, fantastic recent example.

2037
02:22:01,000 --> 02:22:06,000
Anthem can be those things, and I would hope, I would love it if Anthem ends up one of those things.

2038
02:22:07,000 --> 02:22:12,000
Like, prove me fucking wrong, make this game great, right? I just don't fucking trust EA to do it.

2039
02:22:12,000 --> 02:22:21,000
But if there has been some epiphany at a higher level in a boardroom at EA somewhere, where somebody has decided to champion, Anthem is going to be our Diablo 3.

2040
02:22:22,000 --> 02:22:30,000
There's a little problem, though, so far with the way that they've approached that, because they have this roadmap of like, here's how we're going to fix the game, here's how we're going to put out more content for it,

2041
02:22:31,000 --> 02:22:43,000
and they have missed that roadmap completely so far, and I think even now they've removed the roadmap, or portions of the roadmap are missing now because of that.

2042
02:22:44,000 --> 02:22:57,000
So, it's not off to a good start, and trust in EA, of course, is at an all-time low, so I'm hesitant to believe just because this game and this game and this game could do it, that this game's going to do it.

2043
02:22:57,000 --> 02:23:07,000
I don't disagree, I'm trying to give a shred of the benefit of the doubt, but the realist of me, I think you're right.

2044
02:23:08,000 --> 02:23:14,000
And it's a bummer, but at the same time, EA's just made a lot of bad decisions.

2045
02:23:15,000 --> 02:23:17,000
And I just hope that Bioware doesn't have to pay for that.

2046
02:23:17,000 --> 02:23:27,000
I really hope that's true, too, but I think Dragon Age 4 is going to be the make or break thing for Bioware, and so I do hope it's great.

2047
02:23:28,000 --> 02:23:36,000
And I want to see Bioware, I love Bioware, they fucking made Mass Effect, it's a great game, and I wish they could have had another year on Mass Effect Andromeda, I really do.

2048
02:23:37,000 --> 02:23:40,000
In a perfect world, they would go back and actually finish Mass Effect Andromeda.

2049
02:23:41,000 --> 02:23:43,000
And that's where a lot of these problems come from.

2050
02:23:43,000 --> 02:23:47,000
That is why Anthem was never going to get any attention from me.

2051
02:23:48,000 --> 02:23:59,000
Yep, same. Alright, EA, I think, in my opinion, needs to show a little bit more of the, you know, we're viewing these things differently and we're going to make these changes, but I'm not holding my breath.

2052
02:24:00,000 --> 02:24:08,000
We'll see, though. In the meantime, how about something a little bit more of a developer who was with the big time and then ended up doing something a little more indie?

2053
02:24:08,000 --> 02:24:13,000
Well, Igarashi-san, who, I loved meeting him, he's such a rock star.

2054
02:24:14,000 --> 02:24:23,000
But anyway, he was asked about, you know, if there was going to be more bloodstained.

2055
02:24:24,000 --> 02:24:29,000
And so I'm going to read this quote, and this was before the game actually came out,

2056
02:24:29,000 --> 02:24:38,000
Since we're still kind of in development, I haven't thought about it that much, but if bloodstained does well, I'd be very happy, very willing to make a franchise and build upon it.

2057
02:24:39,000 --> 02:24:41,000
Right now, it's about getting the game out, though.

2058
02:24:42,000 --> 02:24:46,000
So, yeah, he said he would be happy and willing to give us more bloodstained.

2059
02:24:47,000 --> 02:24:50,000
To make it a thing. To make it its new Castlevania.

2060
02:24:51,000 --> 02:24:54,000
I can't believe you're already waiting for a sequel and some of us haven't played it yet.

2061
02:24:55,000 --> 02:24:58,000
Hopefully they're able to take some of the things they've done.

2062
02:24:59,000 --> 02:25:04,000
And really put that into a new game. That would be great. Don't you think?

2063
02:25:05,000 --> 02:25:06,000
I think so.

2064
02:25:07,000 --> 02:25:08,000
Yeah, I agree.

2065
02:25:09,000 --> 02:25:13,000
Alright, Loki, just a few more stories and then we're going to look to our Discord for some calls.

2066
02:25:14,000 --> 02:25:17,000
vognetwork.com slash Discord will get you into the Discord and you can go into the green room.

2067
02:25:18,000 --> 02:25:22,000
And it's great to have a little description of what you want to talk about in Channel Orange Lounge Radio. Loki.

2068
02:25:23,000 --> 02:25:27,000
So it's been a while since Grand Theft Auto 5 came out, but they're still making updates to Grand Theft Auto Online.

2069
02:25:27,000 --> 02:25:31,000
So the newest update is going to be this casino that they're adding.

2070
02:25:32,000 --> 02:25:35,000
So the casino has actually been there for a long time. It's been in the game since the beginning.

2071
02:25:36,000 --> 02:25:39,000
And it's just been kind of under construction the entire time.

2072
02:25:40,000 --> 02:25:50,000
The thought was that it was going to be this single player DLC that never ended up coming out because they kind of shifted away from the single player stuff into online.

2073
02:25:50,000 --> 02:25:57,000
In fact, I know that for a while they were actually seeing stuff about the casino even in development as all these different updates came.

2074
02:25:58,000 --> 02:26:04,000
People data mining stuff. But now they're finally going to release the full casino. It's going to be coming out later this summer.

2075
02:26:05,000 --> 02:26:12,000
As they've teased a little bit on Rockstar Games Twitter talking about this brand new casino.

2076
02:26:13,000 --> 02:26:17,000
It says luxury casino at the heart of Vinewood. Opening soon.

2077
02:26:17,000 --> 02:26:25,000
So yes, this is another game that's getting actual gambling mechanics now. It's not beating around the bush anymore.

2078
02:26:26,000 --> 02:26:28,000
It's actual slot machines and gambling.

2079
02:26:29,000 --> 02:26:31,000
I haven't played Grand Theft Auto Online in so long.

2080
02:26:32,000 --> 02:26:39,000
Which is weird because I love Grand Theft Auto and I have it on multiple platforms, but I have not played it in ages.

2081
02:26:40,000 --> 02:26:42,000
It's just such a grind fest.

2082
02:26:43,000 --> 02:26:49,000
Isn't it nice though to see the game get this support?

2083
02:26:50,000 --> 02:26:55,000
I just wish it was a single player DLC. I couldn't care less about the stupid online stuff.

2084
02:26:56,000 --> 02:26:57,000
You caught that one very well.

2085
02:26:58,000 --> 02:26:59,000
I know. I try not to.

2086
02:27:00,000 --> 02:27:02,000
One more story for you guys before we check out our Discord.

2087
02:27:03,000 --> 02:27:05,000
And that has to do with Cadence of Hyrule.

2088
02:27:06,000 --> 02:27:11,000
And I thought this was an appropriate note to end on tonight officially with our plug stories.

2089
02:27:12,000 --> 02:27:17,000
Cadence of Hyrule of course came out on the Switch recently. I still need to play it. It's on my list of things to play.

2090
02:27:18,000 --> 02:27:19,000
But this is really cool.

2091
02:27:20,000 --> 02:27:25,000
If you have a GameCube controller adapter for the Switch and you have your DDR Mario Mix dance mat.

2092
02:27:26,000 --> 02:27:28,000
Yep, you can play Cadence of Hyrule on a dance mat.

2093
02:27:29,000 --> 02:27:31,000
The menus are not going to be the best, but you can do it.

2094
02:27:31,000 --> 02:27:38,000
And it should be noted that Crypt of the Necrodancer, which obviously was kind of the predecessor for Cadence of Hyrule and where it came from,

2095
02:27:39,000 --> 02:27:41,000
has a dance pad mode on Steam, which is really cool.

2096
02:27:42,000 --> 02:27:49,000
So yeah, those of you that want to play DDR cross Cadence of Hyrule, you can do that now.

2097
02:27:50,000 --> 02:27:52,000
If you have all the right equipment, which is a pretty big if.

2098
02:27:53,000 --> 02:27:57,000
I mean, I don't know how many people still have those DDR Mario Mix dance pads, but that's still pretty cool.

2099
02:27:57,000 --> 02:28:03,000
Alright, well that's it for the stories that we had slated to talk about tonight.

2100
02:28:04,000 --> 02:28:08,000
Just have to throw it in my arcade cabinet at home and wire it up to my...

2101
02:28:09,000 --> 02:28:10,000
Yeah, right? You need to do that.

2102
02:28:11,000 --> 02:28:12,000
Dark Sakura, if you need to head out, let me know.

2103
02:28:13,000 --> 02:28:15,000
Yeah, because food.

2104
02:28:16,000 --> 02:28:20,000
The place closes at 9, so I'm going to go ahead and say goodnight to everybody.

2105
02:28:21,000 --> 02:28:23,000
So long and thanks for all the fish.

2106
02:28:24,000 --> 02:28:25,000
Thank you for 17 years, Dark Sakura.

2107
02:28:25,000 --> 02:28:30,000
Well, there'll be 17 more. I'll be decrepit and broken.

2108
02:28:31,000 --> 02:28:32,000
I'll be doing this in the old folks' home.

2109
02:28:33,000 --> 02:28:35,000
I know there's a part of me that wants to ask the question,

2110
02:28:36,000 --> 02:28:38,000
how much longer do you think we'll be doing this? But I think that's kind of a morbid thing to ask.

2111
02:28:39,000 --> 02:28:43,000
And honestly, I think if you'd asked us in, and I think I joked about this when we hit 777,

2112
02:28:44,000 --> 02:28:46,000
I'm almost positive I said early on in the first 100 episodes,

2113
02:28:47,000 --> 02:28:49,000
we're not going to still be doing this episode 777. Give me a break.

2114
02:28:50,000 --> 02:28:54,000
I actually want to contact the Guinness office.

2115
02:28:55,000 --> 02:28:58,000
And see if we can actually get a Guinness World Record.

2116
02:28:59,000 --> 02:29:00,000
You get on that.

2117
02:29:01,000 --> 02:29:02,000
I'm serious. Do it.

2118
02:29:03,000 --> 02:29:04,000
Why not?

2119
02:29:05,000 --> 02:29:06,000
Sure, they'll give Guinness World Records for everything.

2120
02:29:07,000 --> 02:29:08,000
If it's not us, at least we'll know, right?

2121
02:29:09,000 --> 02:29:13,000
But for longest running video game live broadcast.

2122
02:29:14,000 --> 02:29:18,000
Yeah, 17. I can't imagine somebody's got that. Who could?

2123
02:29:19,000 --> 02:29:20,000
So we'll see.

2124
02:29:21,000 --> 02:29:22,000
We outlasted GameProTV.

2125
02:29:22,000 --> 02:29:25,000
We've been here longer than Nick Arcade.

2126
02:29:26,000 --> 02:29:28,000
Alright, we're going to get to some calls, alright?

2127
02:29:29,000 --> 02:29:30,000
Thank you, Dark Saga, for being here.

2128
02:29:31,000 --> 02:29:33,000
We'll see you in two weeks, because you're not here next week, right?

2129
02:29:34,000 --> 02:29:35,000
Yeah, next week is San Francisco Pride, but hey!

2130
02:29:36,000 --> 02:29:37,000
Happy Pride.

2131
02:29:38,000 --> 02:29:39,000
If you're in San Francisco for Pride, come find the sisters and come find me.

2132
02:29:40,000 --> 02:29:42,000
That'll be fun. That's going to be a lot of people, but that'll be fun.

2133
02:29:43,000 --> 02:29:45,000
Don't overheat. Hopefully the weather's nice.

2134
02:29:46,000 --> 02:29:48,000
Alright, moving on. Let's get to some calls.

2135
02:29:49,000 --> 02:29:51,000
We're going to get right to it. Hi, you're on Orange Large Radio. Who's this?

2136
02:29:52,000 --> 02:29:53,000
It's Brad.

2137
02:29:54,000 --> 02:29:58,000
Hello, you're on Orange Large Radio. If you can hear me, say hello.

2138
02:29:59,000 --> 02:30:00,000
Hello?

2139
02:30:01,000 --> 02:30:02,000
He's very quiet.

2140
02:30:03,000 --> 02:30:05,000
Hello, you're there, but you're very quiet on my end, but that might just be on my end.

2141
02:30:06,000 --> 02:30:07,000
Go ahead, sir. Who is this?

2142
02:30:08,000 --> 02:30:09,000
It's Brad from Pod Culture.

2143
02:30:10,000 --> 02:30:12,000
Hello, Brad from Pod Culture. What's on your mind tonight?

2144
02:30:13,000 --> 02:30:18,000
Oh, not a whole lot other than I picked up a toy.

2145
02:30:18,000 --> 02:30:28,000
I'm sorry, could you say that again? Because it was cutting out a little bit while Jamie was packing up stuff, and my TV volume was taking a minute to turn up.

2146
02:30:29,000 --> 02:30:33,000
I picked up a cheap toy at Best Buy.

2147
02:30:34,000 --> 02:30:38,000
You know what, buddy? It's cutting in and out, so I might have to go ahead and...

2148
02:30:39,000 --> 02:30:41,000
I can't hear you guys. I don't know if you can, but I'm going to...

2149
02:30:42,000 --> 02:30:43,000
I'm picking up a squeaky toy.

2150
02:30:43,000 --> 02:30:50,000
Yeah, I'm going to try somebody else and see if it works or if it's on our end, but type it in chat, and I'll try to relay it.

2151
02:30:51,000 --> 02:30:52,000
Okay, sorry, buddy.

2152
02:30:53,000 --> 02:30:54,000
All right, let's try to go to the next call.

2153
02:30:55,000 --> 02:30:56,000
Hi, you're on Orange Large Radio. Who's this?

2154
02:30:57,000 --> 02:31:00,000
Hello, this is SSJ Linger Matt. Can you guys hear me?

2155
02:31:01,000 --> 02:31:05,000
Yes, you're coming through great. In fact, you're probably echoing back through because I have you so loud now.

2156
02:31:06,000 --> 02:31:08,000
Okay, sorry, buddy. What's on your mind?

2157
02:31:09,000 --> 02:31:16,000
I wanted to call in and talk about this whole EA loot box thing that they talked about.

2158
02:31:17,000 --> 02:31:18,000
Go for it, sir.

2159
02:31:19,000 --> 02:31:33,000
I'm a big sports gamer. I play a lot of the NHL games, and I think EA is just really...

2160
02:31:34,000 --> 02:31:38,000
They really just want to die on this hill with the loot box stuff.

2161
02:31:39,000 --> 02:31:45,000
They want to die on the loot box hill. Elaborate on that, please. Why did they want to die on the loot box hill?

2162
02:31:46,000 --> 02:31:57,000
Because these loot boxes that they use, and I would say in the sports games that they have, FIFA primarily brings in so much revenue.

2163
02:31:57,000 --> 02:32:11,000
They bring in far more revenue than the game itself ever brings in with the Ultimate Team aspect of the game.

2164
02:32:12,000 --> 02:32:23,000
For those not familiar with Ultimate Team, you basically draw cards to build your own team.

2165
02:32:24,000 --> 02:32:32,000
Obviously, the better the cards are, the better the players that you have. There's the gold and diamond levels of cards.

2166
02:32:33,000 --> 02:32:39,000
The more likely you'll be able to win games, so it's very much pay-to-win.

2167
02:32:39,000 --> 02:32:51,000
You can incur points to buy packs, but in reality, it's a very slow build.

2168
02:32:52,000 --> 02:32:59,000
You really just have to spend money to get these really good players in order to win more consistently.

2169
02:33:00,000 --> 02:33:03,000
It's so frustrating when you have to spend $60 for the game in the first place.

2170
02:33:04,000 --> 02:33:08,000
At least if the game is free, you are able to chalk it up to, well, that's how they make their money, through this system.

2171
02:33:09,000 --> 02:33:14,000
I think what really infuriates people is when they pay $60 for the game up front and then get this added on top of it.

2172
02:33:15,000 --> 02:33:20,000
There's a similar kind of, like, it's not really loot boxes per se, but there was a similar thing that comes to mind.

2173
02:33:21,000 --> 02:33:26,000
It didn't make tonight's show roll, but there's a lot of gamers that are upset about the NBA 2K 18-19.

2174
02:33:27,000 --> 02:33:30,000
One of those just really went on a deep sale for like three bucks.

2175
02:33:31,000 --> 02:33:32,000
Oh, it was 19.

2176
02:33:33,000 --> 02:33:37,000
What the game's doing now is that there's advertisements you have to sit through and watch.

2177
02:33:37,000 --> 02:33:41,000
Which, if you only paid $3 for a game, okay, maybe that's a little bit understandable.

2178
02:33:42,000 --> 02:33:44,000
But that's happening to the people that paid $60 to support it when it first came out, too.

2179
02:33:45,000 --> 02:33:50,000
But on top of that, though, so what? You don't have to charge $3 for the game.

2180
02:33:51,000 --> 02:33:55,000
Make it a different, like, this is an advertised supported game or something.

2181
02:33:56,000 --> 02:33:57,000
Within the resources.

2182
02:33:58,000 --> 02:34:05,000
So anyway, not to deviate too much from the point you're trying to make, but I feel like the industry as a whole is very much like, how can we double dip this?

2183
02:34:05,000 --> 02:34:13,000
And I think that's what happened in the case of NBA 2K 19 was, okay, it's not loot boxes, but it was, okay, this game isn't selling anymore.

2184
02:34:14,000 --> 02:34:17,000
We know we have a few more months until NBA 2K 10 comes out.

2185
02:34:18,000 --> 02:34:22,000
How are we gonna, how do we make money off people still in these few months that are left?

2186
02:34:23,000 --> 02:34:25,000
Oh, let's sell them and then get them on the ads.

2187
02:34:26,000 --> 02:34:28,000
You know, there's a way to kind of make money there.

2188
02:34:28,000 --> 02:34:35,000
And I think, you know, in some ways the loot boxes was, you know, how can we, you know, make more than $60 off a game?

2189
02:34:36,000 --> 02:34:45,000
Yep. And, and I fear like, recently, they just announced the new, the new version of NHL 20.

2190
02:34:46,000 --> 02:34:50,000
And they kind of just, they've revealed some of like the new features in it.

2191
02:34:50,000 --> 02:35:00,000
A lot of fans are not happy with the game, but a lot of the stuff that they're kind of doing is kind of still gearing a lot more towards the loot box stuff.

2192
02:35:01,000 --> 02:35:12,000
I'll post an article in the Discord after my call, but Game Informer went, wrote up this really big article about all the new features in it.

2193
02:35:12,000 --> 02:35:19,000
And one of the features is that they've changed how the drawing of the Ultimate Team packs are.

2194
02:35:20,000 --> 02:35:28,000
They made a more elaborate, more dazzling, more like visually appealing for when you get like a really good player.

2195
02:35:29,000 --> 02:35:39,000
So, cause they said that they really want to target the streamers and the people posting their videos of them opening packs on YouTube.

2196
02:35:39,000 --> 02:35:47,000
Hmm. So to me, that kind of just like reminds me, and Rob, you kind of know this a little bit more cause I know you've gone to Reno and all that,

2197
02:35:48,000 --> 02:35:55,000
but it's like going to one of those fancy slot machines with the nice lights and the, and you know, the game characters on it.

2198
02:35:56,000 --> 02:36:08,000
It's just like really, they're really just really pushing this really hard and just like trying to like make it as visually appealing so someone could like get addicted to just like the, the gratification portion.

2199
02:36:09,000 --> 02:36:14,000
It's, it's so funny cause I thought you were about to make the example, film the slot machine and then put that on YouTube.

2200
02:36:15,000 --> 02:36:26,000
And I'm like, I, I've, I've heard of people that do that and they make, I know somebody that went to like a convention in Vegas for one of those YouTubers that, that does like slot machine YouTubes and does very, very well at it and has like a great community and stuff.

2201
02:36:27,000 --> 02:36:29,000
It's just, it's so interesting to me. But anyway.

2202
02:36:29,000 --> 02:36:54,000
Yeah, no, there's like, there's YouTubers that just, they open up like a hundred dollars worth of card packs and post it on YouTube and they get so many views and it's like, it's just like people are, people, you know, they say this in, you know, like the NHL Red and all that, that, you know, they want that kind of moment where they can get like that Mario Lemieux, like legendary players.

2203
02:36:54,000 --> 02:37:05,000
Right. And it's like people spend so much money. I got what I wanted. Yeah. All right. Well, my friend, I'm going to let you go so we can squeeze in another call, but thank you so much for calling in tonight. I really appreciate it.

2204
02:37:06,000 --> 02:37:15,000
Nope. It's, it's always good to have you like give that perspective from the sports games. Cause you kind of know that's like our weak area here in studio. We don't always play the yearly, you know, NHLs and MBAs and so forth.

2205
02:37:16,000 --> 02:37:25,000
We try to follow it and kind of like keep an eye on what's going on there, but I love to hear from the people who are like really in there playing them and kind of affected by, you know, some of these crappy loot box things. So thank you.

2206
02:37:26,000 --> 02:37:41,000
Yeah. And this like quick little anecdote about sports games, you know, like sports games are just like anything, like any other game, you know, sports games are just like, you know, an RPG, there's strategy and everything involved. So we're all game. We're all gamers. We all, it's all games.

2207
02:37:41,000 --> 02:37:52,000
So that's right. Then there would have been a time in a day when I would have said like, ah, fuck sports games. Fuck those, you know, but now I'm like, nope, they exist for a very distinct reason. There's people that are very into them and play them. I respect them.

2208
02:37:53,000 --> 02:38:01,000
I just don't go in that space very often, but I think it's, you know, I'm glad it exists cause it brings more gamers into the picture. So, all right, cool. All right.

2209
02:38:02,000 --> 02:38:08,000
All right. Bye. Let's try to squeeze in one more call here before we call it a night higher on orange launch radio. Who's this?

2210
02:38:09,000 --> 02:38:12,000
Hey, this is act deaf. Hey, act deaf. What's on your mind, buddy?

2211
02:38:13,000 --> 02:38:18,000
Well, I can talk about so many things right now, but I want to focus on Google Stadia.

2212
02:38:19,000 --> 02:38:20,000
Yeah, please.

2213
02:38:21,000 --> 02:38:30,000
Well, as you have may said already, and it has been said already, uh, there are so many things with Stadia that won't work at all.

2214
02:38:31,000 --> 02:38:48,000
Uh, I'm not, I kind of try not being so negative about it, but it looks so good on paper, but the execution, it will probably be so really, really bad in so many aspects, especially in the infrastructure thing.

2215
02:38:48,000 --> 02:39:02,000
Because even in the U S that probably has way better speeds than many other places in the world, it's still going to be so it's such a hassle, especially with the bandwidth caps.

2216
02:39:03,000 --> 02:39:10,000
But like, for example, in Mexico, we don't have the bandwidth caps, uh, at least for, uh, like comb internet.

2217
02:39:10,000 --> 02:39:17,000
But even then we don't have, at least not many people have the speed to handle something like Stadia.

2218
02:39:18,000 --> 02:39:27,000
To be, to be fair. I mean, you're right. There's a lot of big cities in the U S who do have that speed, but there are places in remote Alaska, Montana, Wyoming, Colorado.

2219
02:39:28,000 --> 02:39:35,000
There are places where people live in those places that even in California, there's rural parts to say, everybody always thinks about, you know, the beach and Hollywood and all that stuff.

2220
02:39:35,000 --> 02:39:41,000
But out in the redlands, out on the coast, you can't get cell signal for shit out there. And the internet's not great either.

2221
02:39:42,000 --> 02:39:55,000
So, um, you know, there's a lot of places in the U S that, uh, that face a lot of the same issues too. Not to, not to poopoo the points you're bringing up, but you know, uh, I think Google has to realize that they're launching something that's really only going to be usable in big cities.

2222
02:39:56,000 --> 02:40:11,000
So the big internet infrastructure, at least for now, I really wish Google wouldn't have given up on the problem of trying to get internet in more places around the country and, and so on the worldwide, um, because it feels like they've given up on everything else, which is just irritating. It's a whole nother issue.

2223
02:40:12,000 --> 02:40:34,000
Yeah. It's kind of frustrating that they give, they gave up on Google fiber. I would have loved to seen that like in many other places, especially outside of the U S because again, the internet here is not necessarily like really, really bad, but, uh, not many people have access to a good internet connection.

2224
02:40:34,000 --> 02:40:54,000
And it's, and it's kinda something that if Google wants to, a stadium to work, uh, they need to work on that and not necessarily to bring, uh, a complete experience if, if we can say that because yeah, gaming 4k 60 frames per second and all that stuff.

2225
02:40:55,000 --> 02:41:14,000
None of the 30 old people want that, but they just want to play. So they need to focus more on delivering the game service in a stable way, rather than making it like sound, Oh, we, you need all this. We need to, to push forward the graphics and how their game probably runs.

2226
02:41:14,000 --> 02:41:42,000
If it's, if it's stable, if it runs even like a 30 FPS, it's going to be great, but it's still the thing with the bandwidth, the thing with the connections, uh, the, the velocity you need to have. It's like, not necessarily anyone, uh, is has access to that. It's like, probably kind of unnecessary. It's good that there's an option, but not necessarily something that many people want. So yeah.

2227
02:41:44,000 --> 02:41:57,000
Uh, absolutely. Um, what else was I wanting to say with this, with the whole, Oh, I was going to ask your opinion on, because I kind of feel like at the same time we, and we sometimes forget Microsoft is kind of doing the same thing.

2228
02:41:57,000 --> 02:42:08,000
Google is not, not note for note, because obviously Microsoft isn't planning this launch of a separate thing. We know it's something they're going to build into probably windows and, and, uh, and Xbox consoles and so forth.

2229
02:42:08,000 --> 02:42:22,000
But I can't help, but feel like Microsoft is kind of waiting a little bit and maybe they're implementing things a little slower to see how it's received. And then they might go for something full throttle that kind of goes with Stadia.

2230
02:42:22,000 --> 02:42:31,000
I don't know. Have you been like paying attention to what Microsoft's doing? Do you have any opinion on their approach to, uh, uh, games delivering with the X cloud?

2231
02:42:32,000 --> 02:42:59,000
Uh, I haven't seen that much, but from the looks of it, it looks like it's going to be, uh, a better service in terms of infrastructure. Although I, I, I'm still like on the fence about it because if, if like you need a, uh, an Xbox console, or if you need, uh, something in particular to run X cloud, it's not going to be that great either.

2232
02:42:59,000 --> 02:43:21,000
But I'm kind of looking forward to it because at least, I don't know, with Microsoft and what they're doing with game pass, it seems like a good option at least, but I need to like really, really to, uh, for Microsoft to show more and explain more about X cloud before, uh, making a decision or making a judgment on it.

2233
02:43:21,000 --> 02:43:31,000
I kind of think though, like what they're doing and the reason why they have it, I think that's kind of what they're doing. I think they are purposely being a little bit more of a Ninja about this and Bobby points out X cloud already runs on Android phones.

2234
02:43:31,000 --> 02:43:42,000
I think they are, but into, and they're, they're trying to kind of stealth test this and do this a little bit without shouting it from the hilltops. You know, we've got this stream and come on board, do this.

2235
02:43:42,000 --> 02:43:51,000
I think they're just kind of like slowly putting it out there to kind of see how it takes and who's using it to kind of like better, like educate themselves to know then. Okay.

2236
02:43:51,000 --> 02:44:00,000
When we do want to take this to the next level and launch X cloud akin to what Google's doing with Stadia, they'll kind of know a little bit more and they'll have the proof behind it.

2237
02:44:00,000 --> 02:44:10,000
Like we've already been doing this for years and this is what our people say. That's just kind of the impression I'm getting from Microsoft, you know, and I don't, I don't want to come off like a Microsoft fan boy, but again, the reality is, you know,

2238
02:44:10,000 --> 02:44:17,000
I know so many people that have kind of cut Microsoft out B and they made that decision when, you know, the Xbox one launch was a disaster.

2239
02:44:17,000 --> 02:44:29,000
And so they went with, you know, the switch and the PlayStation four and that's fine, but I just think, especially where Microsoft's head is at now and how they're functioning as an organization and how Phil Spencer, you know, I'm just like, Ooh, I'm so like,

2240
02:44:29,000 --> 02:44:40,000
Microsoft is more fascinating to me in some ways than almost anybody else right now, because I'm like, how are they stacking the deck? What are they doing? What, you know, it's like trying to read somebody's poker hand.

2241
02:44:40,000 --> 02:44:45,000
It'll be interesting next year to see what's unveiled. So we'll have to see.

2242
02:44:45,000 --> 02:44:51,000
Yeah, we'll see. Anyway, act up. I got to let you go. So we wrap up the show, but thank you so much as always for your call. I appreciate it.

2243
02:44:51,000 --> 02:44:53,000
Hey, thanks for having me.

2244
02:44:53,000 --> 02:44:59,000
No problem. Take care, buddy. All right. And I think that is going to do it tonight. I'm sorry to anybody that didn't get through.

2245
02:44:59,000 --> 02:45:08,000
But, you know, you can always send us an email, participate at orangelaunchradio.com or however else you'd like to contact the show. Twitter is a great place too.

2246
02:45:08,000 --> 02:45:18,000
We'll read Facebook posts. We don't always interact there very well. I always get harassed from Facebook. People would like to hear from Orange Launch Radio and I'm like, all right, tune in Sunday night.

2247
02:45:18,000 --> 02:45:25,000
We're not the best social media managers. I wish I wish we had somebody that would like take on an internship.

2248
02:45:25,000 --> 02:45:32,000
But at the same time, I want to pay people for their talents, but we don't have a lot of money either. So, yeah, I don't know what to do with that anyway.

2249
02:45:32,000 --> 02:45:36,000
But that's that's a different issue. Last minute stories, Loki.

2250
02:45:36,000 --> 02:45:43,000
Yes. So there's an interesting rumor. We've been hearing stuff about how there's possibly going to be a switch mini or something like that.

2251
02:45:43,000 --> 02:45:46,000
And there hasn't really been much information from that.

2252
02:45:46,000 --> 02:45:56,000
Well, apparently there is this Chinese company, Hino-san or something like that, that has a clear protective case for a Nintendo Switch Mini.

2253
02:45:56,000 --> 02:46:02,000
And it also includes a, you know, looks like a visualization of what it would look like.

2254
02:46:02,000 --> 02:46:08,000
And they have this developed and they're selling it. So is it a thing that's going to be coming out?

2255
02:46:08,000 --> 02:46:11,000
Maybe. It looks like it's based. I reference this a little bit earlier.

2256
02:46:11,000 --> 02:46:17,000
Yeah. So who knows? That's interesting, I guess. I guess we'll find out probably pretty soon.

2257
02:46:17,000 --> 02:46:25,000
And then what else? I was going to say that, you know, we were talking about Stadia earlier.

2258
02:46:25,000 --> 02:46:33,000
So one of the things about Stadia is we found out that Destiny 2, since that's going to be a title that's on Stadia, not cross platform or PC.

2259
02:46:33,000 --> 02:46:37,000
So you're not going to play with PC players on that. It's going to be separate.

2260
02:46:37,000 --> 02:46:42,000
It's odd. Yeah. All right.

2261
02:46:42,000 --> 02:46:53,000
So that's it. And then real quick, then there was a streamer who's raised one million dollars for charity in four hours.

2262
02:46:53,000 --> 02:46:55,000
So that's pretty awesome.

2263
02:46:56,000 --> 02:47:10,000
I guess it was they're saying that this Ben, Dr. Lupo, who is playing Fortnite and nine hundred twenty thousand dollars was donated during that time.

2264
02:47:10,000 --> 02:47:16,000
For what? Doing a charity? Yeah. During Fortnite stream. No. What do we know? The charity. Oh, the charity St. Jude's.

2265
02:47:16,000 --> 02:47:25,000
Oh, OK. Very worthy. That's great. Pretty cool. Yeah. I've seen St. Jude's do like reach out to gamers to do streaming things.

2266
02:47:25,000 --> 02:47:32,000
This is not uncommon for nonprofits to put themselves out there to entice people to do charity thons because, you know, hey, there they need to raise money.

2267
02:47:32,000 --> 02:47:36,000
And so gaming marathons are one way to do it. Apparently your life does this, too.

2268
02:47:36,000 --> 02:47:42,000
Apparently, during the whole Guardian Con charity stream, they had raised their hope of the race three million dollars and the raising three point seven million.

2269
02:47:42,000 --> 02:47:50,000
So, wow. That's very cool. All right. Well, that's going to about wrap it up for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

2270
02:47:50,000 --> 02:47:56,000
Hey, thank you so much for tuning into this show and supporting us over the past 17 years and beyond.

2271
02:47:56,000 --> 02:48:02,000
And I don't think we're running out of fuel yet. So we're going to keep this show going a good long time.

2272
02:48:02,000 --> 02:48:06,000
And thank you guys, of course, for tuning in and your support. We really appreciate you guys being here.

2273
02:48:06,000 --> 02:48:09,000
If you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Lounge Radio, help us spread the word.

2274
02:48:09,000 --> 02:48:15,000
A nice word of mouth spreading, telling a friend or two. That goes a long way.

2275
02:48:15,000 --> 02:48:18,000
A nice five star review on iTunes also goes a very long way.

2276
02:48:18,000 --> 02:48:26,000
The auto hosts on Twitch are like super great and really help out, especially with the word of mouth.

2277
02:48:26,000 --> 02:48:31,000
Yeah. Yeah. Word of mouth and all that. Bobby in chat says RIP. Hangouts on air.

2278
02:48:31,000 --> 02:48:35,000
Oh, yeah. We didn't get to that. Google. Speaking of things, Google's killing hangouts on air. They're going to kill.

2279
02:48:35,000 --> 02:48:39,000
I can't believe that. So many. I mean, they're probably just not making money off it and that's why it's got to go.

2280
02:48:39,000 --> 02:48:44,000
But I just so many people I know use that. That's that's going to be detrimental.

2281
02:48:44,000 --> 02:48:49,000
I'm sure alternatives will pop up, though. But anyway, thank you guys for being here on Twitch and supporting us.

2282
02:48:49,000 --> 02:48:54,000
Really appreciate it. Let's go around and get everybody's final thought. Loki, your final thought.

2283
02:48:54,000 --> 02:48:59,000
My final thought is I'm hoping to work more on my game this week and maybe I'll play something.

2284
02:48:59,000 --> 02:49:05,000
Who knows? I don't know what the way my schedule has been. Maybe not, but we'll see.

2285
02:49:05,000 --> 02:49:11,000
And my final thought is I have to go to the restroom because I've drank this thing full of water.

2286
02:49:11,000 --> 02:49:16,000
So we are ending the show right now. Have a great night, everybody.

2287
02:49:16,000 --> 02:49:19,000
We'll see you next time here at Orange Lounge Radio. Good night.
