27380	32780	Orange Lounge Radio
32780	36100	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show
36100	37980	where every gamer has a voice.
37980	42620	It is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight with episode number 780.
42620	44620	Uh oh, I got a problem in the title.
44620	48900	For this June the 16th of 2019.
48900	54620	My name is Rob Roberts and joining me, welcome back tonight, DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
54620	55620	Oh hi.
55620	56620	Hi, how are you?
56620	57620	Okay.
57620	58620	Yeah, well we missed you last week.
58620	60780	What did you throw?
60780	64980	Our aim is always going to be improving though, but I hope you had a good weekend.
64980	65980	I know you had a very busy weekend.
65980	67620	No, last week was a clusterfuck.
67620	68620	Last weekend was a clusterfuck.
68620	70380	Sorry to hear it.
70380	72700	But hey, I lived.
72700	73700	That's right.
73700	74700	You lived to tell the tale.
74700	76300	I'll just put it this way.
76300	77300	Sack pride was drama.
77300	79980	Yeah, it was a lot of drama.
79980	84820	All right, anyway, Drama Free joining me to my right, your guys' left on TV.
84820	86180	Say hello to Techmaster Loki.
86180	87900	I wish I was drama free.
87900	92300	But you don't have a lot of drama to bring, well not that Jamie brings drama to the show,
92300	93300	but it is.
93300	94820	No, I didn't bring any of it to the show.
94820	97780	But what you did bring, and I'm so excited about this y'all, I'm so excited to show this
97780	102460	and I'll talk about this with our podcast listeners, but you actually picked me up an
102460	104780	early birthday gift and I'm so excited about it.
104780	106180	It's a mini Commodore 64.
106180	107180	Yes.
107180	108900	Look Bobby, finally got one of these.
108900	111340	Tell me a little bit about what made you decide to pick one of these up.
111340	114020	The Evil G has it $50 off retail.
114020	115020	Yeah.
115540	116780	So that's why.
116780	121340	And I think it's because they're clearing the shelves for the new one that will probably
121340	122340	come out this year.
122340	126180	Because I heard there's supposed to be like a C64 fat this year, full size.
126180	127180	I don't know, maybe.
127180	128180	Oh yeah, I already got you your present.
128180	130580	Oh, well y'all don't have to give me presents.
130580	134340	Well no, the pre-order thing.
134340	135740	Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
135740	136780	So here's the thing.
136780	142100	So Orange House Radio actually next week is going to be, I almost said 23 years old, but
142500	144940	on the 23rd will be 17 years old.
144940	149220	Our first broadcast was actually, and it's the right date too, our first broadcast was
149220	151620	June 23rd, 2002.
151620	155380	So next week is going to mark our 17th birthday, but the just kind of ironic thing is that
155380	158740	my personal birthday is three days after that, June 26th.
158740	161180	So it just kind of, it kind of works out well.
161180	163380	And I mean it, I don't really need presents.
163380	168380	I appreciate them, but having you guys here every week to do this show with is a present
168380	169380	in and of itself.
169380	170380	I just couldn't pass it up.
170380	175500	It was like either a PlayStation classic mini or that I was like, well, I'm not buying that.
175500	177300	So I think you made the right decision.
177300	179300	I did make the right decision.
179300	180300	All right.
180300	186620	Uh, so Hey, we've got a lot of gaming news to get into because this week is E3 part two
186620	189780	and there's just a lot going on in the gaming world.
189780	193500	Last week when we were doing our show, we were right in the midst of everything, you
193500	196580	know, with the Microsoft event having gone earlier that day.
196580	199980	This time, you know, it's, it's been done for a couple of days now.
199980	202580	It's interesting because E3, actually, even though it's like a three day show, it feels
202580	206900	like it's a week because you have like your three days of press conferences and then that
206900	209940	overlaps a little bit with three days of show.
209940	211180	So it's kind of like a full week.
211180	212700	It's kind of interesting how all that works.
212700	216340	But uh, in this week we had some more press conferences.
216340	219860	So let's start off with what I kind of think is the big one for a lot of people.
219860	222640	Let's start off with Nintendo.
222640	226140	Now Dark Sakura, you're back after being gone for a week.
226140	229740	So I want to let you start with it because I know there's at least one thing that got
229740	230740	your attention.
230740	231740	There are two things that got my attention.
231740	232740	Okay, go for it.
232740	238140	So number one of course, Animal Crossing and I have sat and not only did I watch the trailer,
238140	243100	but I watched the sponsored gameplay, you know, where they have the translators and
243100	244780	everything and showing all the neat stuff.
244780	248820	I've already decided that when the game comes out, I'm making a web comic out of it and
248820	252780	it's going to be called Fuck You Nook.
252780	255260	I might name it Worst Vacation Ever.
255260	258020	I haven't decided, but I'm really excited about it.
258060	261260	It looks like how I wanted it to, and it's got some neat stuff in there.
261260	265140	I kind of dig the DIY stuff, so I'm really, really pleased.
265140	266140	I'm looking forward to March.
266140	267140	It'll be right before my birthday.
267140	270160	It'll be a perfect present.
270160	273260	What do you think about the whole setup where it's like, it's kind of funny the way it was
273260	276540	set up because they're like, oh, we're going to kick you off on a desert island.
276540	279400	You win a prize, all expenses paid.
279400	280660	You're stuck with no shit.
280660	282540	But people are moving there, right?
282540	283880	So are they moving to your desert island?
283880	284880	Is that the trick?
284880	285880	I guess so.
285920	288640	You could see very plainly in the gameplay that some of your favorites-
288640	289640	There's Hammy.
289640	290640	Yeah, are back.
290640	291640	His name isn't Hammy.
291640	292640	It's like Hamlet.
292640	293640	Hamlet.
293640	294640	Hamlet was in the playthrough.
294640	295640	I'm like, oh.
295640	298880	And I've got so many names now memorized because they're all in pocket camp.
298880	299880	Mm-hmm.
299880	300880	Sorry.
300880	303880	I've been eating cinnamon rolls because I went to IKEA.
303880	304880	That's fine.
304880	305880	They're delicious too.
305880	306880	Look at this.
306880	309240	I'm trying very hard not to eat on stream.
309240	310240	Cinnamon roll.
310240	311240	Half eaten cinnamon roll.
311240	312240	How appetizing.
312240	313240	Because IKEA.
313240	314240	So.
314240	315240	Anyway.
315600	316600	Animal Crossing.
316600	317600	Animal Crossing.
317600	321040	So but I'm really pleased with the updates to the graphical style because it really lends
321040	325720	itself very well to the Switch's capabilities.
325720	330280	I think the biggest thing that was in that trailer that really like sold me on this is
330280	331280	like an upgrade.
331280	335160	And you're all gonna laugh because it's not that big a deal, but I'm like, this changes
335160	336160	everything.
336160	337160	Multiply?
337160	340560	The fact that you can decorate outside your house as well.
340560	341560	Yes.
341560	342560	That changes everything.
342560	344160	I'm gonna make a trailer.
344160	346400	Because now I'm like, oh, this game's got like a Stardew Valley.
346400	349920	With a broken car and some tires.
349920	354840	But there was definitely like, I don't know, I felt it like a Stardew Valley influence
354840	355840	on that trailer.
355840	356840	I might.
356840	357840	Now we can really trap them in fences.
357840	363000	It's a lot of the crafting and DIY-ness that people seem to really like a lot more lately.
363000	364000	Yeah.
364000	366300	So I think the fact that now you can decorate the outdoors and now you're gonna be able
366300	368800	to really make that island your own.
368800	371960	I think that's a game changer because, you know, in the earliest Animal Crossings, it
371960	378600	was, was it put in a number between one and a thousand and it's a seed for a random map.
378600	382600	But it's like, you know, you're so constrained and it's like you keep re-rolling until you
382600	383600	get the one you want.
383600	386780	But if you really, and maybe some of that will be true too, still with like where the
386780	387920	animals move to.
387920	393360	But if you really have the freedom to redecorate and like, you know, you can put like really
393360	396400	hateful things in front of the animals' homes who you don't like.
396400	397840	I can't wait to make signs.
397840	401720	I just want Deanna to live in my village on my island.
401720	406280	And I want, um, I want to kick Ed into orbit.
406280	411800	By the way, I have a new, I have a character that I hadn't seen before named Julian who
411800	414720	lives in Pocket Camp.
414720	420240	And he's a unicorn that wears an outfit with, with stars and stuff on it.
420240	421880	And that guy was in my town at one point.
421880	425160	Well, you know, you know, in the game that you have to, you know, you can sometimes like
425160	428060	help me pick out a present for this person.
428060	431440	And I picked out a handbag for Julian and he's like, I love it.
431440	437320	So Julian is now my, um, drag queen in my game.
437320	439280	So animal crossing, you're very, very happy about that.
439280	440280	Yeah.
440280	441280	Very, very happy.
441280	442680	How do you feel about the delay till March?
442680	443680	I'm glad.
443680	444680	Yeah.
444680	448640	I'd rather it be complete than deal with, you know, Apache piece of shit.
448640	452200	And did you hear that, um, they actually commented about the whole, like, cause Nintendo was
452200	456120	asked about this crunch time thing in this industry and they actually said, you know,
456120	460120	well, you know, they didn't kind of say like animal crossing was delayed due to that, but
460120	464320	they did kind of come out and say, well, we're not afraid to do things that encourage
464320	465320	a work life balance.
465320	469240	In fact, you may have heard us say that we're delaying animal crossing.
469240	471360	We're looking at you Sakurai.
471360	475800	So they did, they bumped it back, assumably to avoid crunch time and all that stuff.
475800	478020	So I I'm, I'm okay with it.
478020	479740	We are looking at you Sakurai.
479740	482280	We're not crunching on our net code at all.
482280	485280	In fact, we're probably just not going to even put it in at all either.
485280	486280	All right.
486280	489320	And anyway, and the other thing I'm super happy about though, I'm sure a lot of us are
489320	494300	as a sequel to breath of the wild and I've already got some theories about it, but the
494300	497800	one of them actually has to do with Zelda's hair.
497800	498800	Okay.
498800	500280	Tell, tell us a little bit about this theory.
500280	501280	Okay.
501280	505040	So you noticed in the trailer that Zelda's hair is cut short.
505040	512040	Usually it's easier to do a female character with short hair if they're going to be playable.
512040	516840	So you think that Zelda is going to be a playable character or maybe chic type of thing.
516840	517840	We'll see.
517840	522180	But my other, my other thing too, is that the Ganon, the thing that they find under
522180	527260	there is the original Ganon from Twilight princess because of where the hand was holding
527260	528260	it down.
528260	533300	I'm, I have a very firm feeling that breath of the wild is going to start bringing in
533300	536320	that continuity that they've really been trying to bring back together.
536320	537840	I do it like, don't get me wrong.
537840	541760	I was, I was happy to hear them acknowledge breath of the wild too, but it's one of those
541760	544020	things where I'm like, we've been new, like this game.
544020	546000	Of course they're making another Zelda.
546000	550920	Of course, after the rave reviews, breath of the wild guy and the, the 10 out of tens
550920	552280	and the sales that that game had.
552280	557000	And the fact that that game probably was a huge part of elevating the switch to the level
557000	558000	it's at now.
558000	559000	Duh.
559000	561240	Of course you're going to make another game in its engine, but it's, it's still, I didn't
561240	563760	think it was going to be a direct sequel though.
563760	564760	That's that's fair.
564760	567560	Like I was expecting it to go like a Majora's mass type of direction where it's like a new
567560	569080	experience just in the same engine.
569080	571840	So the fact, well, to be fair, we don't have a title.
571840	574080	No, but it is a direct sequel.
574080	575080	Okay.
575160	579960	So in this case, number one, they said sequel number two outfits are the same.
579960	580960	Yeah.
580960	584840	Uh, from what I can tell voice acting is the same, even though we just heard gasps, the
584840	587000	layout of the land was the same, the castle was the same.
587000	588000	Okay.
588000	592160	And yeah, we don't see that happen a lot where there's like a direct sequel like that.
592160	595200	Like obviously all the Zelda games have played in the same universe, but you're right.
595200	600320	That's kind of, and in breath of the wild, they said over and over that the evil came
600320	602560	underneath Hyrule castle.
602760	606320	When they did their discovery, it was clearly under Hyrule castle because you see the castle
606320	607320	rise.
607320	608320	Right.
608320	614040	So, um, the other, you know, with the frame by frame analysis, I'd watched it a few times
614040	618040	because I love breath of the wild and I love the lore that it set up a nifty eight Oh five
618040	619040	in our chat room.
619040	622720	We do have a live chat room because of course we do tape live every Sunday night at the
622720	626140	voice of geeks network, twitch.tv slash vog network.
626140	628600	That's V O G or voice of geeks network vog network.
628600	631920	If you want to follow along and then you can get more information at vog network.com.
631920	635440	Cause we have a lot of audio only shows that you should be checking out as well.
635440	639120	Um, but uh, we do tape live and we have our chat room at twitch.tv slash vog network and
639120	641920	nifty eight Oh five says dark Sakura with the receipts.
641920	642920	Yes.
642920	643920	The other thing too.
643920	646640	Oh, she's got a CVS receipt.
646640	650960	I got one question and she's got a receipt a mile long.
650960	653280	Well just other, other things too that led into it.
653280	658320	I had always wanted them to do, I was really wanting more DLC where it was Lincoln, Zelda
658320	660120	going around fixing shit.
660120	665440	Like I've had this whole thing in my head about her trying to, you know, that the treasury
665440	670040	is intact and hiring people and rebuilding the castle town and Lon Lon ranch and all
670040	671040	that crap.
671040	673960	Cause you know, the ruins of Lon Lon ranch or what's supposed to be and the castle town
673960	674960	are all there.
674960	675960	You know?
675960	676960	So I was looking at all of that.
676960	681680	But the other thing that makes me think that this is the true Gannon that's under the castle
681680	685620	is cause everything was something Gannon like a description.
685620	693120	And I truly believe that all of those were a, uh, a projection of the original Gannon.
693120	695000	And I like that theory.
695000	701460	I really liked the idea of it, that there's just so much evil wrapped up in this creature
701460	705620	that by them destroying all of the projections, cause they said that, you know, in the game
705620	708100	it was said that this is the final form.
708100	711660	It's ready to sacrifice itself fully for its mission.
711660	716720	And then that's when the real Gannon wakes up because it has no other forms to project.
716720	720400	So anyway, I've, I've got, I've got thoughts, thoughts.
720400	724860	And from a non lore perspective, I'm dark to see from a, from how to build the game
724860	729000	perspective says it would be easier to reuse a lot of the same code and engine instead
729000	730740	of building a new game from the ground up.
730740	731740	Oh, absolutely.
731740	733540	I kind of always expected, but you're right.
733540	736340	It's more like a direct sequel as opposed to it's a new Zelda story.
736340	737340	It's just in the same engine.
737340	742540	Well, and now the other thing, the other thing too is that, um, have you ever watched, there's,
742540	748940	there's a YouTube channel I love called Boundary Break and, um, well, and I had already known
748940	752700	some of this cause I like to see like, well, you know how I was in world of Warcraft when
752700	755500	I got my demon Hunter.
755500	761020	Like we all did like end of time and two hours later I'm like, I'm still an end of time outside
761020	762120	the boundaries.
762120	766860	You know, I'm in Dalaran now, an instance Dalaran, um, you know, I do stuff like that.
766860	770620	So I love Boundary Break and you know, just looking into the complexity of how they built
770620	776500	the game and that you've actually got rendered land outside of the borders.
776500	780740	It makes me think they could do so much more with the engine that they probably had the
780740	784160	capacity to and just did not.
784160	785400	This is our developed area.
785400	787660	The rest of it is no man's land.
787660	793300	Mistake theory with a perspective in our chat saying, I love when Nintendo does direct sequels,
793300	794500	silver and white too.
794500	798420	I think you mean black and white too for Pokemon are probably my two favorite Pokemon games
798420	799420	for that reason.
799420	800420	Yeah.
800420	803260	So, um, anything else on the Zelda sequel?
803260	804260	Cause I want to talk.
804260	808340	So, so dark Sakura's mentioned, those are the two things that got her going excited.
808340	810500	And those, those, yeah.
810500	815460	And nifty 805 says Lincoln, Zelda are the new sunny and share and Sia Tabiri says, so
815460	818100	link should avoid skiing and Zelda is basically immortal.
818100	819100	Oh geez.
819100	820100	All right.
820100	821100	And does she believe in life after love?
821100	822100	All right.
822100	823100	Anyway.
823100	824940	So those are the two things that got you excited.
824940	825940	Also shipping.
825940	829700	I'm very excited about those games as well, but let me talk about the things that got
829700	833940	me going like, okay, so here's the big thing.
833940	837340	And Jamie, you have to appreciate this as well.
837340	844180	Um, so we heard the rumors that the collection of mana was going to come out in the U S right.
844180	847860	Although I full expected that they were going to do the lazy and they were just going to
847860	852220	take final fantasy adventure, secret of mana, and they were either going to cut second and
852260	855900	two, three, or they were going to give a secret of evermore instead, which I actually would
855900	856900	have been okay with that.
856900	857900	You know, I have that cartridge.
857900	858900	Yeah, I do.
858900	859900	I do too.
859900	860900	Plot twist.
860900	862500	Um, I don't have a lot of games, but that's one of them.
862500	865260	And I always think that game got a lot more crap than it really deserved.
865260	866260	I thought it was fine.
866260	871860	Um, but then they came out and said, Oh yeah, the collection of mana is coming out.
871860	877300	And by the way, second, it's at two, three is now trials of mana and it's out today.
877300	878940	And I was like, bye.
878940	879940	Yeah.
879980	883300	Collection of mana is out on what girl I've played it on the switch.
883300	884900	Holy crap.
884900	885900	You didn't catch that.
885900	886900	No.
886900	890180	Cause I keep in mind, I've also been at work and had the drama.
890180	891180	No, I got you.
891180	892180	I got you.
892180	893180	So I'm going to miss it.
893180	894180	Yes, girl.
894180	895180	You can play on the East door.
895180	896180	Yeah.
896180	897180	Okay.
897180	898180	I'm going to go get my switch in the other room right now.
898180	899180	I'm messaging Dan right now.
899180	900180	You can play second.
900180	902780	It's at two, three, the official English version right now.
902780	908100	In fact, actually on my personal Twitch stream at Rob Roberts, cheap plug, uh, like on Wednesday
908100	909100	and Friday this week.
909260	911940	I've played through about two hours on stream, maybe a little longer, two and a half hours
911940	913580	on stream and played some of the game.
913580	918080	It's really like I did play the translated ROM a little bit, a long time ago, but I was
918080	919080	kind of like lost.
919080	922580	I didn't really know what I was doing and not to say that's necessarily changed, but
922580	927020	I do feel like with the official English translation, I'm, I'm kind of like, I dunno, I'm a little
927020	930420	bit like able to figure stuff out and go in the right directions.
930420	932020	That's uh, that's really cool.
932020	933560	Now here's the other thing.
933560	937340	So not only did they announce that trials of mana or second, it says your three is out
937340	941380	today in the English version of the collection of mana, but they announced we are working
941380	942740	on a remake.
942740	948300	So trials of mana is already being remade, just like they did secretive mana like earlier,
948300	950780	like it was about last year, they did secretive mana.
950780	952840	Now not everybody loved that remake.
952840	957060	It had its issues, but Square Enix is saying, and they're talking about, we have learned
957060	960620	from some of the issues of this and this is what we're going to do different with trials
960620	961620	of mana.
961620	964860	So it is nice to hear the company say we're doing some things differently.
964880	969060	Um, so yeah, I'm like already excited for that remake as well.
969060	973020	So, um, and you know what I've, I've been playing, it's, it's different.
973020	976820	Trials of mana is different because like the beginning of the story is different depending
976820	978780	on who you start with and how you build your party.
978780	979780	Well, right.
979780	985460	And because you, you're basically taking, uh, three different storylines out of seven
985460	989820	players, six, six, and building it from there.
989820	990820	Yeah.
990820	993480	So, but yeah, anyway, so if you want to check out trials of mana, it's out now.
993480	996440	So that was, that was definitely one of the big ones that got me going, what?
996440	1001200	Um, and then I would say as far as like games coming out today, uh, then they released that
1001200	1002200	cadence of Hyrule.
1002200	1006920	I mean, it wasn't today, but it was still like what by the end of E3 cadence of Hyrule
1006920	1011120	came out, uh, which, you know, I haven't been able to play yet, sadly, because here's the
1011120	1012120	thing.
1012120	1015120	And y'all have even called me out on this on Twitch.
1015120	1018000	If I buy cadence of Hyrule, what's going to happen?
1018000	1022080	I will suddenly stop playing trials of mana and not get any further.
1022120	1023120	So I have not bought.
1023120	1028360	Well, then I will be playing through it because I don't really care about cadence of Hyrule.
1028360	1030240	I didn't like Crypt of the Necrodancer.
1030240	1031240	It just wasn't fun to me.
1031240	1032240	Yeah.
1032240	1035240	Well, you know, apparently they've made some changes to make it a little, I don't want
1035240	1039960	to say to make it easier, but to make it feel a little less grindy, like, I guess you don't
1039960	1043320	necessarily lose everything like you would in a lot of roguelikes.
1043320	1046060	You don't necessarily lose everything when you die and go back to start.
1046060	1049240	So they have tried to make some, I guess, quality of life improvements probably to appeal
1049240	1051440	a little more to Zelda fans in that regard.
1051800	1055320	If there was something else I was a little excited about was the Panzer Dragoon remake.
1055320	1056320	Yes.
1056320	1057320	How could I forget?
1057320	1058320	Oh, my God.
1058320	1059320	You know, what's funny?
1059320	1062440	The news about the remake was already out there because I was like, I feel like did
1062440	1066560	we and it what we did mention on a previous episode that but it was kind of like almost
1066560	1067560	an aside.
1067560	1069840	All it was was that we know these companies are working on it.
1069840	1074240	We don't know where we don't know when we don't know how, but it turns out Nintendo,
1074240	1075480	it's a switch game.
1075480	1080040	So somebody brought up during Bobby's show, though, a Panzer Dragoon VR.
1080040	1084200	I know you ain't all about VR, but I got to say, when I heard that was like, oh, things
1084200	1088240	I didn't know I needed until you said it, there's a couple other things I was really
1088240	1089240	excited about.
1089240	1090240	Yeah, please.
1090240	1094440	I mean, I'm actually disappointed about the Dark Crystal RPG.
1094440	1095640	That was like a surprise, wasn't it?
1095640	1098600	I hate tactics games, but you're going to try it anyway.
1098600	1099600	No, I won't.
1099600	1100600	No.
1100600	1101600	OK.
1101600	1102600	I know I don't like tactics games.
1102600	1103600	I've tried to like tactics games.
1103600	1105480	I'm like, I'm going to love this game.
1105480	1106480	I love this.
1106480	1107480	No, I hate it.
1107480	1108480	I can't play Fire Emblem.
1108480	1109480	I can't play.
1109920	1113720	I tried to love the Macross one back in the day, and I hate them.
1113720	1114720	See, here's the weird thing.
1114720	1115720	Like, I'm with you.
1115720	1117400	Like most tactic games I can't get into.
1117400	1119200	I have tried to get into Sky Eye.
1119200	1122880	I've tried to get into Fire Emblem.
1122880	1124120	I just don't get into it.
1124120	1127520	But Final Fantasy Tactics, give me more.
1127520	1131760	Like I would give me another Final Fantasy Tactics like seriously.
1131760	1136120	The other thing I was really happy about and I saw it and then forgot about it, but I was
1136120	1144600	still happy, was John Romero doing a game, but I didn't see anything about zombies.
1144600	1146160	And then Contra Rogue Corps.
1146160	1147160	Contra.
1147160	1148160	Yeah.
1148160	1151880	It looks like hot garbage, but I'll probably play it anyways.
1151880	1153080	And I don't give a shit about Witcher.
1153080	1158280	Well, it's done by the same guy that did Contra 3 and one of the other Contra games.
1158280	1160420	So it's one of the original creators.
1160420	1163720	So I'm down for that, but it just looks like hot garbage.
1163720	1167780	But it should be noted that the other big it's out today announcement, because we love
1167780	1169640	it when Nintendo does those, right?
1169640	1172320	The other big it's out today is the Contra collection.
1172320	1175520	So Jamie, if you missed the memo, I mean, you're probably like, I already own all those
1175520	1176520	games.
1176520	1179160	But if there's something you're missing in that Contra collection, that all came out
1179160	1180160	as well.
1180160	1181160	Just dropped.
1181160	1182240	It's nice to have it in one place.
1182240	1183240	I think possibly.
1183240	1189080	I mean, also I'm a little bit weirded about Luigi's Mansion 3, although I'm looking forward
1189080	1190760	to co-op because I would play that with Dan.
1190800	1193120	Do you know how many memes I've seen already about Gooigi?
1193120	1199200	Anyway, SSG100Matt kind of sums up the new Contra game saying, yeah, that Contra game
1199200	1203880	looks like it knows what it is and could be totally fun, can't be trash.
1203880	1204880	That's what Contra 3 was.
1204880	1205880	I'm actually.
1205880	1206880	That sounds like me.
1206880	1207880	Actually, I'm.
1207880	1208880	I'm totally fun, can't be trash.
1208880	1214240	You know, if Contra is self-aware like that, and to be fair, there's a playable panda bear
1214240	1215400	I spotted in that.
1215400	1221580	So that on the self-aware meter makes me think if Contra is self-aware that it can't be trash,
1221580	1223240	that actually could be a great thing.
1223240	1224240	That's Contra 3.
1224240	1228080	You were jumping from missiles, I mean, from missile to missile.
1228080	1229080	It was can't be trash.
1229080	1231240	It's a very kind of Bayonetta thing.
1231240	1232240	Loki, let me ask you.
1232240	1234800	I mean, we've we've talked about our faves from Nintendo.
1234800	1235800	What what caught your eye?
1235800	1236800	The Contra thing?
1236800	1237800	When I saw.
1237800	1240000	OK, I know there was one other thing that had to catch your eye on that.
1240000	1241000	The No More Heroes.
1241000	1242000	Yeah, No More Heroes 3.
1242000	1243000	I don't.
1243000	1244000	I don't remember two, though.
1244600	1245600	I played through one.
1245600	1246600	Yeah.
1246600	1247600	I think maybe.
1247600	1248600	No More Heroes 2 did come out.
1248600	1252440	We need like a collection to come back because I haven't I don't remember them very well.
1252440	1256160	But yeah, No More Heroes 3 looks crazy.
1256160	1258160	So that'll be neat.
1258160	1261400	I was kind of underwhelmed by all of it.
1261400	1264920	And I know that's a horrible thing to say, but I was underwhelmed by all of it.
1264920	1265920	It was just kind of.
1265920	1266920	Did you?
1266920	1267920	OK.
1267920	1271420	Did you maybe like I have to admit at the end of it, I was kind of like, oh, you know,
1271420	1272980	because I want.
1272980	1276940	It's so weird because, OK, I'm going to get so much shit for this deservedly, but I don't
1276940	1277940	care.
1277940	1279820	I'm I'm living my truth.
1279820	1285020	When they announced the Breath of the Wild sequel, I was kind of like, oh, OK, yeah,
1285020	1286020	great.
1286020	1287020	Like, we knew that was going to happen.
1287020	1290340	Yet another game that we can add to the list that's in development, like Metroid Prime
1290340	1291340	4, you know?
1291340	1292340	Yeah.
1292340	1297540	There was that part of me that was like, I kind of wanted to see more on Bayonetta 3.
1297540	1298540	I would have loved enough.
1298540	1303060	Where I hope they put out that Metroid Prime trilogy.
1303060	1307180	But I like, you know, that was my like initial gut reaction.
1307180	1310500	But then, like a couple hours later, I really looked back and I said, wait a minute, Rob,
1310500	1312620	you're doing that thing that you tell people not to do.
1312620	1315740	Don't set these expectations for things you want to see.
1315740	1317900	And then when they don't appear, you're just going to get disappointed because I took a
1317900	1318900	step back and really looked at it.
1318900	1321300	I was like, you know, Nintendo really did have a fun year.
1321300	1322300	They had a lot of stuff.
1322300	1324740	So did what I'm asking you, look, did you maybe make that same mistake?
1324740	1327180	Did you know I had no expectations?
1327180	1330940	I had no expectations, but like some of these games, like a Panzer Dragoon remake is like,
1330940	1333260	it wasn't something I was looking for.
1333260	1337420	So I didn't really care that they're making it, you know, same with the new Contra game
1337420	1342780	looked OK, but it was like, oh, my God, I got to play that, you know, it's and I don't
1342780	1344360	really play Smash too much.
1344360	1347420	So, of course, they had, you know, the big announcement is Badger Kazooie is in Smash
1347420	1352460	now as a character, as well as Dragon Quest Hero.
1352460	1353660	I think you want to add to this, Jamie.
1353660	1357480	I was just saying if they were going to do Panzer Dragoon, why don't they go and get
1357480	1362300	what people really want and do Panzer Dragoon Saga or RPG?
1362300	1366840	Well, maybe, you know, if one does well, it leads to the next kind of like I would say,
1366840	1369780	because that Secret of Mana remake did well enough, it convinced them, you know, even
1369780	1372940	if it maybe wasn't here, maybe did better in Japan, I don't know, but I think it did
1372940	1373940	fine enough here.
1373940	1377500	I think it did well enough where now they went and they did trials of Mana and we're
1377500	1379220	getting an English version because of it.
1379220	1380220	They're taking that effort.
1380220	1384580	So, I mean, if a game does well, they might be encouraged to do more.
1384580	1388300	Now I will say this before y'all like drag me about and cancel me about what I just said
1388300	1389580	about Nintendo.
1389580	1390740	Here's the thing, though.
1390740	1395060	Here's what Nintendo does very well with their direct.
1395060	1399620	And like I give them an A plus on this, honestly, where I don't think Microsoft really does
1399620	1400620	this.
1400620	1402700	I don't think Square Enix or any of the other ones we're going to talk about really did
1402700	1403920	this.
1403920	1409060	Nintendo did a great job in that I would say maybe like 90% of those trailers save for
1409060	1412740	maybe like the No More Heroes and a couple others, 90% of those trailers.
1412740	1417820	And I made up that statistic, but I feel like most of what we saw, you saw gameplay.
1417820	1421340	You didn't just see a pre-rendered CG announcement thing.
1421340	1423200	You saw gameplay.
1423200	1426220	You saw what those games really look like.
1426220	1431560	And that gets me more excited about the games when I can see, oh, that's the game I'm going
1431560	1432740	to be playing.
1432740	1435820	What have I been sitting here bellyaching about Death Stranding for years and years
1435820	1437040	on this show?
1437040	1442680	As rad as it is, as great as this cast looks, as much as I love Hideo Kojima, where's the
1442680	1443680	fucking game?
1443680	1448320	And they did, they did finally show it to us, but still I have this sense of, I'm not
1448320	1453520	sure what it really looks like, you know, I'll probably buy it anyway because Kojima,
1453520	1455560	but what is the game?
1455560	1456560	You know?
1456560	1462080	So anyway, I love that Nintendo shows the game and I give them major props for that.
1462080	1463080	I do.
1463080	1464080	So.
1464080	1465880	I'm not saying it was bad.
1465880	1470240	I'm just saying that like, I'm not entirely excited about all the stuff that they have.
1470240	1474840	Animal Crossing looks okay, but like I, my expectations for Animal Crossing aren't very
1474840	1475840	high either.
1475840	1480200	It's just, I'll play it when it comes out, but like, I don't know, there wasn't really
1480200	1485480	anything that had me jumping up and down like, oh my God, I need to buy this, you know, whatever.
1485480	1486640	It's fine.
1486640	1489400	That's how I kind of buy things on the Switch anyways.
1489400	1492480	Now SSGL 100 Matt says something that I kind of agree with too.
1492480	1496000	I was really disappointed that there wasn't any Nintendo online news.
1496000	1499920	I really hope they were going to be saying, yeah, yeah, that is kind of disappointing,
1499920	1503800	but Bobby has a really good point and I was disappointed at first too, but then I kind
1503800	1508560	of took a step back and realized they could kind of do a direct about that whenever they
1508560	1510940	want and people will still receive it.
1510940	1513400	And I think Bobby kind of hits the nail on the head here.
1513400	1516800	Bobby says, I think September is when we'll get that.
1516800	1520680	So people resubscribe because people bought their Nintendo online for a year.
1520680	1524080	Now in September, Nintendo is going to be tasked with, now we need you to renew for
1524080	1525080	another year.
1525080	1529400	So I think any big announcements and things along the line of other freebies like Tetris
1529400	1535320	99, and there's the, I think, which I would bet with the success of Tetris 99, Nintendo's
1535320	1538360	got to be looking at and going, what else can we put?
1538360	1542960	What if I says 100 and that, okay, here's here, you ready?
1542960	1546640	You're ready for my pie in the sky dreamboat thing that Nintendo, I really want them to
1546640	1552840	do an NES remix, super multiplayer about it.
1552840	1553840	I like a new one.
1553840	1554920	Think about it.
1554920	1555920	Super NES remix.
1555920	1556920	Yeah.
1556920	1558920	Maybe, maybe to go with it anyway.
1558920	1562040	Um, let's see, uh, what else did I want to mention?
1562040	1565400	There was, I thought there was one other thing from the, Oh yes, the one other huge game
1565400	1566760	none of us talked about.
1566760	1569460	We talked about the link, uh, breath of the wild sequel.
1569460	1573320	We did not talk about all that they showed with the links awakening remake.
1573320	1574320	That's coming out.
1574320	1575320	It's pretty interesting.
1575320	1576320	I love the art style.
1577320	1581640	And I love that they added that little, I don't want to call it a Mario maker mode,
1581640	1585840	but they definitely added like the customizable dungeon, which, you know, doesn't seem like
1585840	1590600	it's Oh my God, like all this customizability, but it's enough to kind of make you go, Oh,
1590600	1591600	that's neat.
1591600	1593560	You know, like, Oh, that's an additional, that's something new, you know, something
1593560	1595200	to add to the table to remake.
1595200	1596720	And I thought that was really cool.
1596720	1598240	I mean, I'm going to pick this game up.
1598240	1599240	Hello.
1599240	1604820	I like these, like 2.5 Z Zelda's are like, or 2.5 D Zelda's are like my favorite.
1604820	1606380	So I'm going to definitely pick it up.
1606380	1607740	I mean, no question.
1607740	1608740	And Mario maker too.
1608740	1609740	Hello.
1609740	1610740	I'm buying it.
1610740	1611740	Of course.
1611740	1612740	Yeah, of course.
1612740	1613740	But I'm glad they didn't spend a lot of time on that.
1613740	1617700	The one I thought they spent maybe a little too much time on was, um, the dragon quest
1617700	1618700	builders too.
1618700	1622700	Cause we kind of knew that was coming and you know, we already kind of know and we just
1622700	1624460	saw it previously at screening.
1624460	1628080	The one good thing though, that did come out of that whole, uh, tree house thing is they
1628080	1631020	did walk back their decision on multiplayer.
1631020	1633040	Oh, good call.
1633040	1634040	They did.
1634040	1638360	They're going to allow, you know, you'd be able to play with friends online as well in
1638360	1639600	unranked matches.
1639600	1643320	So that's going to be coming after launch, but it is something that's coming.
1643320	1644320	Yeah.
1644320	1645320	All right.
1645320	1649200	And then we had a little more information on Pokemon sword and shield as well, but a
1649200	1652840	lot of that during the direct, when they were showing them a lot of that, uh, I'm sorry,
1652840	1657600	the tree house, when they were showing some of that, like the, um, I can't poke ball plus
1657600	1658600	none.
1658600	1660560	Well, yeah, there's that, but I'm thinking what the, Oh my God.
1660560	1663880	Now I can't remember the name and I already hear Shane screaming at me somewhere at the
1663920	1665360	little Corgi with a heart on its butt.
1665360	1666360	Yeah.
1666360	1667360	What was the name?
1667360	1668360	The cute thing.
1668360	1669360	Yeah.
1669360	1670360	Oh my God.
1670360	1671360	That thing was so adorable.
1671360	1672360	Yipper.
1672360	1673360	Yapper.
1673360	1674360	Something like that.
1674360	1675360	Adorable.
1675360	1676360	So that was cool.
1676360	1678080	But I know there's a little controversy going on with Pokemon as well, but stay tuned.
1678080	1680120	We're going to address that a little bit later in the show.
1680120	1681120	So yeah.
1681120	1682120	All right.
1682120	1683120	Um, so Yamper, thank you.
1683120	1684120	Act.
1684120	1685120	I knew somebody in chat.
1685120	1686120	We know Yamper.
1686120	1687120	I was clear.
1687120	1688120	Yelper.
1688120	1689120	Old Yeller.
1689120	1690120	Old Yelper.
1690120	1691120	All right.
1691360	1692360	Uh, yeah.
1692360	1694480	And SSG100 Matt points out the sheep Pokemon.
1694480	1695480	Yeah.
1695480	1696480	The Wooloo.
1696480	1697480	That looked really cute too.
1697480	1702280	Although, you know, we've already had sheep Pokemon, so we had a Mareep, poor Mareep rest
1702280	1703280	in peace.
1703280	1704280	All right.
1704280	1705280	Anyway.
1705280	1706280	Uh, let's move on.
1706280	1707280	There were other conferences as well.
1707280	1708280	Right.
1708280	1710720	Uh, the night before we had Square Enix's event.
1710720	1711720	Yeah.
1711720	1716360	So just quickly, I want to say, um, Bobby and I did that thing we mentioned last week.
1716360	1717600	We did our, Oh, you were watching.
1717600	1718600	I was watching.
1718600	1719600	What'd you think?
1719600	1720600	I thought it was good.
1721080	1725240	So that's, it doesn't just have to be me and Bobby to someday me and you can do it someday.
1725240	1726560	You and her can do it.
1726560	1730720	You know, we can, we, we have the technology to be able to do those impromptu shows.
1730720	1731720	I was surprised.
1731720	1737840	Our chatters seem to be really into it because what I tried to do is I tried to not be cynical
1737840	1739120	about it.
1739120	1743140	And I think that goes a long way with people because too many times we look at live streams
1743140	1747800	and there's, there's people going like, Oh, this sucks or this is trash or this is garbage
1747960	1752200	or let's take the camera into the bathroom and like all these like trashy things.
1752200	1753200	Right.
1753200	1759920	So I, well, we did, sorry if I join in, you know, something positive.
1759920	1760920	It's not going to be positive.
1760920	1764080	I'm going to have, you know what, I'm only going to allow you on a stream like that.
1764080	1768380	If I get a little, what the buzzer that comes with the board game taboo.
1768380	1774360	And every time you negative, I get to go, that poor battery is going to be burnt to
1774360	1775360	Chris.
1775360	1776360	What do you guys think?
1776360	1786200	We're going to hit the buzzer and the batteries are drained by the end of the night.
1786200	1791040	Oh yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
1791040	1793040	And Oh, and no from Bobby.
1793040	1796320	Well, so far yeses are in the lead.
1796320	1800400	Bobby's going to need that for anytime Rob calls into a show because you never know.
1800400	1804200	You know, I dropped the F bomb on the Bobby Blackwell show tonight when he tries to keep
1804200	1806040	his show very clean.
1806040	1807040	And I made a booboo.
1807040	1810680	I slipped up because it was after six o'clock and like the gremlins, you don't feed them
1810680	1812960	after midnight or they might drop an F bomb.
1812960	1813960	All right.
1813960	1815960	Anyway, let's, let's talk about the Square Enix thing.
1815960	1816960	Actually, let me ask dark Sakura.
1816960	1819520	I don't know if you saw, I know you were busy with work and stuff.
1819520	1822400	Did you see any of the stuff out of the Square Enix event?
1822400	1824280	The Avengers thing is pretty interesting.
1824280	1830520	It looks nothing like them, but I was really into final fantasy seven really into it.
1830520	1831520	Yeah.
1831520	1832520	Doesn't the remake look good?
1832840	1836040	Honestly though, I don't like Barrett's voice.
1836040	1841960	I mean, it just, it sounds like it's trying to be a tough voice, but it sounds like it's
1841960	1843240	trying to be a tough voice.
1843240	1844240	You know what I mean?
1844240	1845680	But Tifa and Cloud sound great.
1845680	1846680	Okay.
1846680	1850840	But if, if we're talking about seven and the remake and getting to see things in HD, how
1850840	1854040	are your feelings about Aerith?
1854040	1862480	I still hate her, but did you notice how much it seemed to focus on Cloud and Tifa?
1863440	1865360	Why did they change?
1865360	1866360	What happens?
1866360	1869600	Oh, no, she has to die.
1869600	1871280	Oh, no, no, no.
1871280	1872280	You forget.
1872280	1874080	She actually has to die for the plot.
1874080	1875560	You need to take that thought out of the universe.
1875560	1878560	I want you to pick up that thought and take it out of the universe.
1878560	1881360	You throw that thought away in the garbage disposal.
1881360	1882360	The Resurrector.
1882360	1886360	It's just J-100 Matt says, buzz him now.
1886360	1887360	Too late.
1887360	1888360	All right.
1888360	1889360	Anyway, sorry, dark Sakura.
1889640	1892640	One other thing I did notice dark Sakura was that they did, for what it's worth, they did
1892640	1898440	call her Aerith in the English language version, so they must not be changing your name this
1898440	1899440	time.
1899440	1900440	Well, honestly, that's how it should be.
1900440	1901440	Right.
1901440	1903560	But Sephiroth sounded a little weird.
1903560	1905320	I didn't like Sephiroth either.
1905320	1908840	That was probably my biggest criticism too, but the gameplay like, seriously, it's like
1908840	1913080	they took Final Fantasy 15's engine, which we all knew that's what was happening, right?
1913080	1914080	And they made it better.
1914080	1917840	Like, they really like, oh man, I, that's the one thing I really wish I could have gone
1917840	1921640	to LA and played was that, but you know, my friends that are down, that were down there
1921640	1924720	and got their hands on it say, this is, this is great.
1924720	1930960	It's just, it's weird to me that this is basically Final Fantasy 16.
1930960	1933880	And if, and if Delvin was here right now, he'd be telling me, I've been telling you
1933880	1934920	that.
1934920	1938840	And I don't think they're, they're not going to call it like 16, 17 and 18 because call
1938840	1940320	it Final Fantasy 16.
1940320	1945580	But basically the reason why we haven't seen a Final Fantasy 16 is because this is it.
1945580	1947580	They're putting everything into this.
1947580	1952460	That would have been going into a Final Fantasy 16, including, yeah, multiple, like a Final
1952460	1958580	Fantasy 16, 16, two and 16, three clearly, because as we heard, the first episode is
1958580	1962600	nothing but Midgar and it's two Blu-rays.
1962600	1966460	So clearly they are going to expand on the story crazy.
1966460	1967960	They have to be.
1967960	1973180	And so my poor bandwidth cap and I, I can't, oh man, fuck you for putting that thought
1973180	1977540	out there because now I'm like, what if they do change major plot points?
1977540	1978540	Like what if they do too?
1978540	1979540	I don't think they changed that one.
1979540	1984520	I think that one is like, oh my God, there would be protests outside of Square Enix headquarters
1984520	1990780	led by her, but I'd be out there with my sign.
1990780	1991780	Yeah.
1991780	1993780	Let me put more evil into the universe.
1993780	1996220	What if there's multiple endings?
1996220	2002740	One you get the killer and one she's stays around and lives the, actually I don't hate
2002780	2003860	you as much for that.
2003860	2005920	It's not the whole killer and lives thing.
2005920	2011020	The multiple ending thing though, we have to address Final Fantasy seven's kind of crappy
2011020	2012020	ending.
2012020	2013520	That is going to have to be addressed in the remake.
2013520	2017200	And I do fully expect, you know, it's, we're about 10 years from finding out what it's
2017200	2018980	going to be by the time we get there.
2018980	2024840	But I expect them to address the ending of Final Fantasy and multiple endings.
2024840	2025840	Why not?
2025840	2030580	Why not a good ending where you see the red 13, who by the way was very much absent from
2030580	2031580	that preview.
2032500	2036360	What if we see the red 30, you know, you guys, I'm, I'm talking about a game from the nineties,
2036360	2040480	so I hope it's not spoilers at this point, but if you watch during the credits, you see
2040480	2046200	red 13 run out into, and see a Midgar where the life is back and the plants I've grown
2046200	2047200	around it.
2047200	2049160	And that is like, kind of like the true ending in many ways.
2049160	2052800	And that was the best part of the ending in my opinion, um, cause the rest of it didn't
2052800	2056480	make a lot of God damn sense, but, um, maybe there may be something like that would be
2056480	2057480	expanded on.
2057480	2059360	You see more if you get the good ending.
2059380	2064140	I just hope that they incorporate, um, some of the, uh, Advent children's stuff because
2064140	2065580	that movie is bad-ass.
2065580	2069380	I just hope they let you skip the fucking summon animations finally.
2069380	2070380	Knights of the round.
2070380	2071380	No, no, no, no.
2071380	2077740	I want to be able to pick and choose to skip like, because if I need to go to the bathroom
2077740	2082020	during the end of the game, I want to be able to do some Knights of the round, Quadra magic
2082020	2083820	and mimic or whatever.
2083820	2088700	So I can go have a decent pee break and come back and have it still finishing.
2088720	2092880	I have made a sandwich during the process of that entire thing.
2092880	2097020	Akuma JP putting his thoughts on the ending out in our chat room at twitch.tv slash vog
2097020	2100640	network saying, no, no, that was to show red is not extinct.
2100640	2101720	He got kids.
2101720	2102720	That is true.
2102720	2106680	You could see his child in that little sequence to children has been a long time in that sequence
2106680	2107680	too.
2107680	2110680	So, I mean, there's many, many conclusions and many things you can draw out of the ending.
2110680	2111680	That's for sure.
2111680	2116320	As children under Matt says one Blu-ray disc is just the data for the summons.
2116320	2117400	Here's hoping.
2117400	2123100	Here's hoping I that Shiva animation better scream gay pride.
2123100	2124100	Yes.
2124100	2127060	I wish you could see the face Jamie just made.
2127060	2128060	That's uh huh.
2128060	2129060	Yeah.
2129060	2132100	Cause like when Shiva comes out and snaps her fingers, I want to be left shooketh.
2132100	2133100	Hold on.
2133100	2136100	Can you see me?
2136100	2137100	Yes.
2137100	2140260	That that's the face she made.
2140260	2141940	Even even Loki is kind of smart.
2141940	2142940	Yep.
2142940	2147220	When she, when she comes out and does her thing, I want it to be like, I just like,
2147220	2155240	I, and, and lady Gaga appears on a giant Mac and every, like, it's just, and there's
2155240	2156240	a parade.
2156240	2157240	Yes.
2157240	2158240	That's what I want.
2158240	2159240	And there's a parade.
2159240	2165820	I can just picture that actually see like, you know, look, look, you can have all the
2165820	2166820	other summons.
2166820	2167820	Okay.
2167820	2168820	Okay.
2168820	2172720	Straight people can have Knights of the round and E free and whatever black, but we get
2172720	2173880	the diva.
2173880	2174880	Let me have Shiva.
2175300	2177300	Let my people have Shiva.
2177300	2178300	Okay.
2178300	2179300	Anyway.
2179300	2185460	And Shiva, by the way, drag queen, wasn't 13 that Shiva was on a motor or was Shiva
2185460	2187460	sisters on the motorbikes.
2187460	2188460	Yes.
2188460	2189460	Yeah.
2189460	2190460	Yeah.
2190460	2191460	All right.
2191460	2201300	Anyway, tell us about some other things we saw at the square enix event, Loki, uh, final
2201300	2204440	fancy crystal Chronicles remastered edition.
2204440	2205440	Yeah.
2205440	2209840	I it's, it's kind of interesting to see that like, um, without the game boy advance and
2209840	2212240	the, the complicated setup that that required.
2212240	2214000	Um, but I'm, I'm kinda into it.
2214000	2215720	I'd like to check out that game again.
2215720	2219560	Last remnants being remastered as well, which is okay.
2219560	2222480	And we kind of knew that was happening cause the other one got delisted.
2222480	2223480	Yeah.
2223480	2226360	Uh, dragon quest builders two looked okay.
2226360	2230880	The first game is a lot of fun and it looks like they really amped up what you could do
2230880	2233020	creatively in the second one.
2233020	2235060	I'm definitely interested in the second one.
2235060	2237300	I just feel like there's so many other games to play.
2237300	2240980	I feel like it's one of those games that's going to get lost in the shuffle, but I, I
2240980	2242940	feel like I owe it to myself to check it out at least.
2242940	2244380	Cause the first game is a lot of fun.
2244380	2247260	I, I didn't beat it, but I played a lot of it.
2247260	2249900	Is it part of the Xbox game passing?
2249900	2252900	So maybe we should talk about that real quick.
2252900	2253900	Actually a little tan.
2253900	2254900	You ready for a tangent?
2254900	2258460	I do not believe it's part of the Xbox game pass, but we did talk about Microsoft last
2258460	2259460	week.
2259460	2260460	Right?
2261040	2263960	Um, you know, cause I wouldn't have, because I didn't do it till my new Tuesday.
2263960	2267040	I bought the Xbox Xbox game pass ultimate.
2267040	2273600	Um, I, they, they had a great deal where just for a dollar, you can upgrade your existing
2273600	2278640	go for, I don't know how long it goes for, but see, Bobby did the smarter thing.
2278640	2282240	I didn't, I didn't realize, I thought it was just a dollar for the first month and that's
2282240	2283240	all I was getting.
2283240	2284240	And I was okay with that.
2284240	2286000	I was prepared to pay the 15 a month or whatever.
2286000	2290360	And I, I saw some chart that talked about converting gold time to, so I didn't think
2290360	2293460	it was going to be one for one, but I paid the dollar and it's like, okay.
2293460	2296480	So is that dollar per month or is it a dollar a dollar?
2296480	2300500	And then it said your next billing date, March, 2020, because that's when my current Xbox
2300500	2301500	live was set to expire.
2301500	2305060	And I was like, Oh my God, I could have padded that out like with a cart.
2305060	2306980	And that's exactly what Bobby Black Wolf did.
2306980	2310620	He went and he pad, I guess it won't let you pad it out more than three years.
2310620	2315060	So don't buy too much Xbox live, but you go buy like, just buy like a two year card, pad
2315060	2318540	out your Xbox live, then pay the dollar to upgrade and you're going to be happy.
2318600	2323480	But you know your results may vary, read the fine print, make sure that promotion is still
2323480	2327440	going because I'm sure as Microsoft realizes more and more people are figuring this out,
2327440	2329640	they're going to pull the plug on that.
2329640	2333700	But I just, yeah, but anyway, I mean, I was fully prepared to pay the 15 a month after
2333700	2336760	this month and I would have done it.
2336760	2340360	And yeah, I, so, so when I get to my gaming week, I'll talk about some of the games I've
2340360	2342240	been able to play as a result of that.
2342240	2347560	But yeah, I think that's worth noting is that Microsoft did convince me to get on this game
2347560	2351820	pass ultimate thing because it's kind of what I was hoping for from Stadia that I didn't
2351820	2352820	get.
2352820	2354820	So I'm going to put my stock in the Microsoft thing.
2354820	2358780	Yeah, I think Microsoft's getting a lot right for the future, so we'll see.
2358780	2362660	I'm so curious to see how Sony responds to it next year.
2362660	2363660	We'll see.
2363660	2364660	Anyway, sorry.
2364660	2365660	Back to Squeenix.
2365660	2374500	They showed off a Dragon Quest 11 Echoes or S Echoes of an Elusive Age.
2374500	2378560	Yes, the Definitive Edition where now I'm kind of pissed off I bought the first version
2378560	2381300	because this other one seems like it has so much more.
2381300	2388400	You can flip between the classic Dragon Quest and it has the redone music, which the original
2388400	2391000	game badly needed, let me tell you, and so on.
2391000	2395240	So I'm kind of mad that I'm probably going to buy this again.
2395240	2396240	Let's see.
2396240	2401520	They showed off the expansion for Final Fantasy 14 a little bit, Shadowbringers.
2401520	2402520	That was cool.
2402520	2403520	Don't get me wrong.
2403540	2409380	Final Fantasy 14, but I feel like they spent a lot of time on that when it's like literally
2409380	2413540	out in like less than three weeks.
2413540	2419260	Romancing Saga 3 and Scarlet Grace.
2419260	2422660	Also they showed off a little bit of gameplay for Dying Light 2, which has been a while
2422660	2425740	since they've shown that.
2425740	2428460	War of Visions, Final Fantasy Brave Exvius.
2428460	2432180	Oh yeah, that was the tactical spinoff of the mobile game.
2432180	2433180	Yeah.
2434160	2440240	It is not the same as Final Fantasy Tactics, so I'm not interested in playing it on mobile
2440240	2441240	at the end of the day.
2441240	2444920	There's a game called Outriders by the people that did Bulletstorm.
2444920	2450160	Oh yeah, that looked like an Eidos type of thing when Square purchased that.
2450160	2453920	So yeah, that looked alright for people that are into that.
2453920	2456040	Final Fantasy VIII remaster.
2456040	2460300	I think a lot of people excited about the VIII remaster, so you're probably wondering
2460320	2467720	because I'm somewhat known and disliked sometimes for saying that Final Fantasy VIII is my least
2467720	2470960	favorite in the entire franchise.
2470960	2475560	However I'm very happy for the fans of Final Fantasy VIII that they get this remaster.
2475560	2478800	As long as it's not as fucking grindy.
2478800	2480760	Well that's the thing is that, here's the thing.
2480760	2484320	My problem with Final Fantasy VIII was never the story or the characters.
2484320	2488100	I actually think all of that is great and would have made for an amazing movie if Final
2488100	2490000	Fantasy had gone that direction.
2490000	2494660	It's the drawing magic, the junctioning magic, and that whole system is just broken.
2494660	2500820	And having that system in a game where you can't outlevel the monsters as well, it doesn't
2500820	2502640	work for me at all.
2502640	2507180	And so I'm kind of like, I don't see how a remaster is going to fix that for me.
2507180	2511920	But granted the PC version had that change where you could just instantly draw a 99 to
2511920	2515300	1 spell, you know, so you kind of cheat a little bit through the game.
2515300	2516300	So I don't know, I'm undecided.
2516600	2522660	It kind of depends what price they put it out for, but for the sake of the fans that
2522660	2526620	always tell me I'm being unfair when it comes to Final Fantasy VIII, I'm willing to give
2526620	2528240	this a shot.
2528240	2530240	So to be continued.
2530240	2534740	And the one I was looking forward to was Marvel's Avengers, which they showed off some gameplay
2534740	2537640	for that, but I don't know.
2537640	2542400	The gameplay didn't look all that exciting and I'm a little put off by the way the characters
2542400	2543400	look.
2543500	2544660	I know I get it.
2544660	2546600	It's not supposed to be the cinematic universe.
2546600	2551000	I'm fine with that because we've had, you know, other designs in other games that have
2551000	2552000	been fine.
2552000	2556080	But something's just really kind of weird looking at it, but they have like a really
2556080	2557400	good voice cast for it.
2557400	2559160	So I'll be willing to give it a shot.
2559160	2564200	Just like if I have to look at Marvel's Avengers versus like Marvel Ultimate Alliance, I'm
2564200	2567720	kind of leaning a little bit more towards Marvel Ultimate Alliance 3.
2567720	2569120	The Ultimate Alliance games have always been good.
2569120	2571600	Yeah, we didn't even bring that up in Nintendo's event.
2571600	2573320	They showed Marvel Ultimate Alliance 3.
2573320	2574320	Hello.
2574320	2576320	Well, I guess we talked about that before.
2576320	2580080	But still to see it in action, hear about the DLC, see just how many characters are
2580080	2581080	in it.
2581080	2582080	That was pretty cool.
2582080	2583080	Yeah.
2583080	2584080	So I don't know.
2584080	2587560	I mean, I'll check it out, but it's just the premise doesn't have me like, Oh my God, I
2587560	2589240	really need to play this.
2589240	2590240	Here's the thing.
2590240	2591240	It's I didn't dislike it.
2591240	2593480	In fact, as it was going, I was like, OK, this is pretty neat.
2593480	2594480	Like I'm into it.
2594480	2602560	But I fully realize they can't have the the characters in the Avengers look like the movie
2602560	2603560	side.
2603560	2604560	Yeah, I'm fine with that.
2604560	2609720	And they spent a lot of time trying to justify that it was a different universe and it's
2609720	2611080	not the characters you're used to.
2611080	2615400	In fact, I kind of feel like they spent too much time trying to justify it because there
2615400	2618560	was that whole sequence where they had like Troy Baker and Nolan North and the other voice
2618560	2622840	actors sit down and they're like, yeah, Bruce Banner, he's kind of like this character that
2622840	2623840	da da da.
2623840	2628440	And it's like, OK, as much as I love these voice actors, as talented as they are, I don't
2628440	2632840	need to hear them recite characters we already know to me, because I think the reason why
2632840	2638040	they did that is they were really trying to show it's these versions of the characters.
2638040	2640440	We have a separate version of these characters.
2640440	2644280	What I would have preferred to see is just let the game do the talking.
2644280	2647580	Yeah, let the game do the talking, because then when they came out on stage and they
2647580	2650880	started to talk more about, oh, it's going to be like there's going to be co-op and it's
2650880	2654000	going to be a persistent experience and you're going to have these generated quests that
2654000	2655000	you can do.
2655000	2657120	I was like, I would like to know more.
2657120	2658120	Are you going to show me?
2658120	2659120	No.
2659120	2660120	Oh, OK.
2660120	2661120	And you're not.
2661120	2662120	OK, fine.
2662120	2666080	So I'll just have to wait and see when they it comes closer to coming out, which is next
2666080	2667080	May.
2667080	2671240	So, I don't know, just right now, it's just I'm not that excited about it.
2671240	2676300	I was really looking forward to it when it was coming out, but I don't know.
2676300	2677300	It's fine.
2677300	2678300	Yeah.
2678300	2679300	So the movie has some comments.
2679300	2681300	There's some really good comments in chat.
2681300	2684220	Kaijuto in chat just flat out says Avengers looks like trash.
2684220	2688180	I just want a sandbox superhero or Marvel game.
2688180	2692220	Mistake Theory says the six Tomb Raider games they made were just so good.
2692220	2696360	I can't help but think they had to have brought some of that greatness over to the Avengers.
2696360	2697760	And I'm kind of with you there, too.
2697760	2701200	Like I'm I'm not going to write this game off yet.
2701200	2705460	I'm just kind of like my reaction to this whole thing was cool story.
2705460	2708060	Can't wait to see the game.
2709060	2710060	And then I'll make some decisions.
2710060	2711060	Yeah.
2711060	2712060	I mean, it's we've got lots of time.
2712060	2713060	You didn't see enough.
2713060	2716100	S.J.A. 100 Matt in chat says I don't hate the designs at all.
2716100	2719940	And I understood from the get go that this was not going to be MCU related.
2719940	2723860	But I think when you combine gamers and comic fans both hate everything.
2723860	2728660	And the fact that Endgame is so fresh in everyone's mind that folks are upset.
2728660	2731940	People will get over the designs when the game comes out and it's good.
2731940	2732940	And that's yeah.
2732940	2733940	Let the game do the talking.
2733940	2737140	If the game is really good, let the game do the talking because I feel like a lot of that
2737220	2741380	was just justifying this isn't the Avengers you're used to.
2741380	2743680	It's going to be our version and our version.
2743680	2749820	Super cool because we got Nolan North and and OK, I'm sure it's let the game do the
2749820	2750820	talking.
2750820	2755460	You know, you could you could have you could have who I'm trying to think of like really
2755460	2759460	terrible voice actors that you could have Lance Bass, Gilbert Gottfried, Mandy Moore.
2759460	2766700	You could have Gilbert Gottfried voicing Black Widow and if the game is really good, it won't
2767260	2768260	matter.
2768260	2769260	You know what I mean?
2769260	2771700	So that's that's all I'm saying.
2771700	2775140	And no, just no disrespect to those fine, talented voice actors.
2775140	2778060	They were doing a good job at doing what they were asked to do.
2778060	2782260	I just wish that Square had taken a different approach to how they announced and unveiled
2782260	2783260	that.
2783260	2786380	SSG 100 Matt suggests Danny DeVito as Hulk.
2786380	2787380	Danny DeVito is everything.
2787380	2788380	Come on.
2788380	2789380	Come on.
2789380	2790380	Yes.
2790380	2791380	All right.
2791380	2792380	What else is Square Enix?
2792380	2793380	That was it.
2793380	2794380	That was it.
2794380	2795380	All right.
2795380	2796380	Well, then let's move on.
2797060	2798060	What did Ubisoft talk about?
2798060	2801180	I didn't watch this whole thing because there's a lot of the games I just really don't care
2801180	2802180	about.
2802180	2803900	But I didn't see any of it because I was working.
2803900	2806980	So I did check out a bit of it.
2806980	2810100	So I watched the Watchdog Legion stuff, which looks pretty neat.
2810100	2814220	So that the kind of the hook with Watchdog Legion, it's going to take place in London
2814220	2819660	and you can recruit a bunch of different characters, pretty much anybody in the world.
2819660	2824660	So you'll be able to, you know, they were showing this grandma who is like an assassin
2824700	2829740	type person and a bunch of other, you know, hacker types that you could get.
2829740	2833700	And, you know, one guy might be, you know, an expert at drones or something.
2833700	2838420	And so you you do research on them and then you can recruit them in or they can get killed.
2838420	2843620	And it's it's really neat that you have like this big crew that you kind of work together
2843620	2847100	on taking back London.
2847100	2848540	So that's coming out March.
2848540	2853940	I did like that they're kind of like evolving the series as opposed to like the same old
2854020	2856660	type of formula in a new city or something like that.
2856660	2859660	Yeah, I like that. They're like, well, how can we make this a little different?
2859660	2863500	Oh, hack the planet. Literally, you know, that would be something different.
2863500	2865740	Yeah, it looks like it does look interesting.
2865740	2867940	So I do want to play it.
2867940	2869980	Hopefully I will finish this one.
2869980	2871340	I haven't played the first one.
2871340	2876700	I have it and I haven't finished the second one.
2876700	2879460	Ubisoft will honestly probably give the first one away.
2879460	2883380	Maybe even the second one when this one's about to come out just to try to build.
2883380	2886020	Yeah, probably PlayStation Plus is that a lot.
2886020	2887860	But I've yeah, I've still got this somewhere.
2887860	2889300	I've like not played it at all.
2889300	2891300	But the second one's a great game.
2891300	2893140	So I will have to get around to it.
2893140	2897060	Nifty 805 says, can I take back London as Kylie Minow?
2897060	2902260	Hey, maybe, maybe, you know, they can't use the Spice Girls, but I bet you they could
2902260	2908300	have a pop superstar group that you could possess and take over with your dance moves.
2908300	2910300	Let's put another girl through her paces.
2910300	2915940	Yeah, that sounds pretty wrong when you say it like that.
2915940	2918260	That's quoting something like Spice World.
2918260	2924100	It's like that's like something a pimp would say, you know, anyway.
2924100	2930020	So because everybody has to have their own service subscription service, Ubisoft has
2930020	2938520	you play plus, which you can subscribe to for about 15 dollars a month.
2938520	2940800	And it's going to be a PC only service.
2940800	2946480	And they're going to have, I guess, early access that's going to free access before
2946480	2951280	if you sign up before August 15th, you'll get free access from the 3rd of September
2951280	2953820	to the end of September.
2953820	2961120	And then they have access to over 100 PC games early and beta access to new launch titles.
2961120	2965840	And also with DLC and expansions being included with that, too.
2965840	2967640	Well, there's room for everybody.
2967640	2973400	How about we just say that that was kind of how I felt and I'm worried because when
2973400	2980280	it comes to the the game subscription service thing, everybody wants to do their version
2980280	2984580	of it now because they saw what happened with movies, how Netflix and somewhat Hulu really
2984580	2986700	got to dominate the conversation early on.
2986700	2991760	And now everybody likes CBS, like even Disney Plus, to an extent, has to catch up, although
2991760	2994320	we all know Disney Plus is not going to have a problem catching up.
2994320	2998160	But, you know, we have to see all these other now didn't see an answer going to do their
2998160	2999160	own thing now, too.
2999160	3000160	I don't know.
3000160	3001160	But but this is only PC.
3001160	3006120	So I'm kind of fine with that because Ubisoft games are part of like the Xbox Game Pass
3006120	3007120	stuff.
3007120	3009580	So it's kind of OK.
3009580	3015080	Then they've got Rainbow Six Quarantine, which is going to be a new co-op game with zombies.
3015080	3016080	Hooray.
3016080	3019740	That's coming out in 2020.
3019740	3024560	They showed off some stuff for Assassin's Creed Odyssey, this new mode called Story
3024560	3031340	Creator Mode, which allow you to create your own quests and share them with other players.
3031340	3032340	So neat.
3032340	3035620	That's a way to kind of get more life out of the game when they're not doing another
3035620	3036700	Assassin's Creed this year.
3036700	3039960	They're taking the year off, which is OK, honestly.
3039960	3042740	It's OK to not do one every single year.
3042740	3045920	They showed off a Ghost Recon Breakpoint.
3045920	3050480	So that's going to have a new beta that's going to be along with the game win pre-orders
3050480	3053520	and they're going to kick off in those games or money.
3053520	3054520	Yep.
3054520	3056520	September 5th.
3056520	3064820	And then apparently there's going to be Tom Clancy's elite squad, which is a mobile game.
3064820	3068760	They're doing a Division movie on Netflix.
3068760	3072660	And then this is something that's kind of interesting, Roller Champions, which is a
3072660	3077660	brand new free to play multiplayer game.
3077660	3083100	It's a kind of roller derby or like a cross between rugby and roller derby.
3083100	3084540	Yeah, it looked pretty cool.
3084540	3089360	I'll give a quick shout out actually to one of our listeners, Dark Tetsuya, who actually
3089360	3093340	had submitted a YouTube of him playing this for a potential midpoint break for tonight's
3093340	3094340	show.
3094340	3098240	One of the reasons I couldn't use it was because it has a lot of copyright music in it.
3098240	3101420	And I was worried it was a little loud in his video and I was like, we might get Twitch
3101420	3105940	muted if I use this, but I think he put it up on YouTube and Dark Tetsuya, you can feel
3105940	3109420	free to link it here now, but you should check out his gameplay video if you're curious for
3109420	3110420	more on that.
3110420	3111980	Cause I'm kind of curious to check this out.
3111980	3114660	I like the roller blade type of games.
3114660	3120020	And then other gaming stuff, they also had Gods and Monsters, which kind of looks like
3120020	3124540	it's like a Zelda type game, but with Greek mythology.
3124540	3126540	And so that's kind of neat.
3126540	3128780	Yeah, that looked cool.
3128780	3133100	They also had a new mode and customization for For Honor.
3133100	3137340	So it's this mode called Soul Rush.
3137340	3145820	And they also shot off yet another TV series, Mythic Quest Ravens Banquet, which is being
3145820	3150060	done by the folks behind It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia.
3150060	3158740	So it's about, I don't know if he's going to be in it, but, how was it, Rob McElney
3158780	3164900	He basically, him, Charlie Day, and they say Megan Ganz.
3164900	3167960	So I know him and Charlie Day are in It's Always Sunny.
3167960	3173780	It's supposed to be about a game development studio and just kind of the stuff that goes
3173780	3174780	on there.
3174780	3178700	And so basically he plays this guy named Grim.
3178700	3182500	Can you imagine, and it's always, oh my God, this actually, now I'm like more hyped about
3182500	3183500	this than when I first heard it.
3183500	3188020	So here's the thing though, it's only on Apple's TV plus service or whatever they've got.
3188020	3190260	They're like stupid subscription service.
3190260	3192740	Just well, just like I'm going to probably get it.
3192740	3196140	Just like I said, everybody's got their own subscription service now and it's making it
3196140	3197860	difficult as a consumer.
3197860	3200120	Well, that isn't just an Apple problem.
3200120	3201260	It's an NBC problem.
3201260	3203460	It's a CBS all access problem.
3203460	3207780	It's everybody wants a piece of the pie and of course, doing it because it is another
3207780	3208780	year.
3208780	3214100	So you have another year of Just Dance, Just Dance 2020 also coming to the Wii.
3214100	3217180	I think people made way too big of a deal out of the fact that it's still coming out
3217180	3218180	to the Wii.
3218180	3219180	Who cares?
3219180	3220180	Let's be real.
3220180	3221180	It's not that complicated.
3221180	3224140	And everybody, by the way, did you notice how people were saying, oh, I guess none for
3224140	3225820	the Wii U, huh?
3225820	3229180	The Wii U plays Wii games by releasing it for the Wii.
3229180	3233800	They are in fact releasing it for the Wii U, food for thought, but it doesn't matter.
3233800	3237100	You guys said, you guys that are going to the extent to listen to a podcast about video
3237100	3239380	games, we're never going to buy this game on the Wii anyway.
3239380	3240380	You're buying it on whatever.
3240380	3244900	Well, I shouldn't say that maybe, but you're going to buy it on whatever other current
3244900	3247260	platform you're gaming on or PC probably.
3247260	3248340	Or Stadia.
3248340	3254060	The Wii is for those multitude of retirement homes and community centers that still use
3254060	3256700	these games a lot to get people up and moving.
3256700	3261340	Like don't underestimate the casuals when it comes to Just Dance.
3261340	3264340	Don't underestimate the power of the casuals.
3264340	3265340	That's right.
3265340	3266700	Don't underestimate the power of the casual.
3266700	3268820	So that's it.
3268820	3272500	You didn't mention, somebody in chat mentioned it, but when you talked about like shows,
3272500	3274180	you didn't mention the Division movie.
3274180	3275180	I did mention it.
3275180	3276180	That was, I mentioned that first.
3276180	3277180	Oh, I guess I just blacked out.
3277180	3278180	Yes.
3278180	3279180	They're getting a movie.
3279180	3280180	My bad.
3280180	3281180	Yeah.
3281180	3282180	Coming to Netflix.
3282180	3283180	Okay.
3283180	3284180	All right.
3284180	3285180	So yes, there's, and what?
3285180	3286180	Jake Gyllenhaal and who was in it?
3286180	3288620	The redhead, Jessica Chastain, right?
3288620	3294500	I don't know, but that sounds interesting more so than the TV show, but I do want to
3294500	3297220	see the TV show because I like It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia.
3297220	3299220	Ooh, great.
3299220	3303580	Comment on Just Dance by Questbuster in our chat room saying the Wii is also used in a
3303580	3307460	hospitals as a rehab option for some patients like kids.
3307460	3311740	Well, that, that'll make you feel like garbage for making fun of the fact that game's coming
3311740	3312740	out for the Wii.
3312740	3313740	Yeah.
3313740	3314740	You're making fun of sick kids now.
3314740	3315740	Yeah.
3315740	3316740	Piece of trash.
3316740	3317740	Think twice before you tweet.
3317740	3318740	Anyway.
3318740	3319740	No, but in all seriousness.
3319740	3323980	I mean, aren't the kids sick enough and you're now you're making them played like a decade
3323980	3324980	old console.
3324980	3325980	I mean, come on.
3325980	3330440	In all seriousness, it is very cool that, you know, if they're able to put the game
3330440	3335040	on the Wii, hey, they're still supporting it because there is situations like that.
3335040	3340320	And maybe they're not the majority of cases, but you know, it's, they wouldn't put it on
3340320	3342160	that console if it wasn't selling.
3342160	3343160	Exactly.
3343160	3344160	Exactly that.
3344160	3348800	So, and mistake theory also points out it's also still carried in libraries.
3348800	3352560	A lot of libraries still only have Wii games and no other consoles.
3352560	3357040	I don't know if this joke is wrong or not, but I, I, I love a good pun.
3357040	3359280	So Sia Tabiri says, we have.
3359280	3360280	Why not?
3360280	3361280	Why not?
3361280	3362280	That's what works for me.
3362280	3363280	That works for me.
3363280	3364280	I love a good pun.
3364280	3365280	Why not?
3365280	3369280	I love a good pun when I was saying them the other week.
3369280	3371280	Well, cause yours aren't good.
3371280	3372280	All right.
3372280	3373280	Moving on.
3373280	3375200	Uh, your favorite event, every E3, right?
3375200	3376600	Loki, the PC gaming show.
3376600	3377600	Oh yes.
3377600	3378920	It's so, so amazing.
3378920	3384360	I don't really give a shit, but, um, we can just really quickly go over some of the stuff
3384360	3385360	that they did talk about.
3385800	3390160	Uh, some of the titles that they showed off, age of wonders, planet fall.
3390160	3393400	Uh, I don't know what the hell that's about.
3393400	3397000	Auto chess has nothing to do with cars.
3397000	3400240	Maybe instead they, they, they announced a lot of games.
3400240	3402760	Maybe we just want to touch on some of the highlights.
3402760	3403760	I am.
3403760	3404760	Chivalry 2.
3404760	3405760	That's pretty cool.
3405760	3406760	Yeah.
3406760	3407760	Chivalry is a pretty good game.
3407760	3414520	Uh, Chris Tails looks interesting.
3414520	3419600	This is supposed to kind of go along like a big time travel aspect.
3419600	3420600	So that looks interesting.
3420600	3421600	Yeah.
3421600	3424280	These, these time travel and time loop types of games are all the rage.
3424280	3429080	I know you weren't here last week and I doubt you watched the Microsoft thing very carefully,
3429080	3433920	but there was a really cool looking narrative game by Annapurna, um, that I was a big fan
3433920	3435780	of called 12 minutes.
3435780	3439400	That's about like a time loop type of situation and it looked, I would, I would really urge
3439400	3442640	you to look at the trailer for that game cause it looked really cool and I think you'd be
3442640	3443640	into it.
3443760	3447160	I, it's probably a multi-platform, probably not just Microsoft.
3447160	3448160	Yeah.
3448160	3450440	Um, they showed off more footage for Last Oasis.
3450440	3456920	That's the one about, um, I remember it's something that has to do with like a plan
3456920	3462220	of being un, um, you can't inhabit it because it's just basically too hot.
3462220	3467680	And so there's only this strip down the middle that basically they can survive on and they've
3467680	3469400	got these rolling wood machines and stuff.
3469400	3470400	It looks pretty awesome.
3470400	3472760	So that's, that's something they showed off.
3472920	3475560	Um, Midnight Ghost Hunt.
3475560	3476920	That one looks pretty cool.
3476920	3479520	And so basically you have to hunt ghosts.
3479520	3480520	You don't say?
3480520	3481520	Yes.
3481520	3485360	Um, but I remember correctly, there was one I saw, I don't know if it's the same, maybe
3485360	3488480	it was a different, uh, indie game that was ghost hunting, but there was one I saw that
3488480	3492400	was like four against one and you get the, as the ghost, you actually get the possess
3492400	3495440	object and throw them at other players and knock them down and stuff.
3495440	3497880	It's kind of like prop hunt, but a little different.
3497880	3501640	Um, Hey, real quick question from Frodo Swagons in our chat and maybe, maybe you have the
3501640	3502640	answer to this Loki.
3502680	3505760	So, but can someone explain to me what that auto chess game is?
3505760	3508680	I keep seeing advertisements for it everywhere, but I don't see any good feedback and I must
3508680	3511680	admit I'm not up and up on the auto chess myself.
3511680	3514280	Did you, did you catch a little more on what that's all about?
3514280	3515880	No, no idea.
3515880	3520480	It's a, they said it's a part of one of the Epic store games that they're going to have.
3520480	3528560	And it's, um, I mean, honestly it looks like just this really fancy chess game.
3528560	3533280	I guess it looks like it's, I don't know, like battle chess.
3533280	3534280	Okay.
3534280	3537280	So I'm looking up some more info online just so we can get familiar with it.
3537280	3540440	And, and where, where sometimes the hosts fail, the listeners are there to save the
3540440	3541440	day as well.
3541440	3544640	And I'll get some, you have to understand that, you know, your question is outweighing
3544640	3546080	my interest in the games.
3546080	3547360	Well, here's what it's all about.
3547360	3552680	So there's a mod for Dota called Dota auto chess, and you can do eight players that play
3552680	3558240	a modified version of chess, but it uses characters and gameplay elements from Dota two.
3558240	3561600	And apparently this is really popular in Dota, which is probably why I missed it.
3561600	3565840	Cause I've played probably like 95% heroes of the storm, 5% league of legends.
3565840	3568560	I just don't really play any Dota anymore.
3568560	3570280	But maybe I should be, I don't know.
3570280	3575360	But apparently now this is so, so, and this is really funny because Dota exists, Dota
3575360	3578880	two exists because it was Warcraft three mod spun off.
3578880	3579880	Now we have Dota.
3579880	3582360	So now this auto chess mod is so popular.
3582360	3584680	It's spinning off into its own game, auto chess.
3584680	3586020	That's what's happening here.
3586020	3591100	So, uh, and then, uh, our listeners here, quest buster says, uh, one note on auto chess.
3591100	3594780	Apparently it's also responsible for pushing valve to make Dota underlords and riot games
3594780	3596620	do the same auto chess light game.
3596620	3598380	I had no idea what it was either.
3598380	3599580	It sounds like a MOBA.
3599580	3602960	You create teams from a pool of characters, then set them to auto battle.
3602960	3605800	But unlike a MOBA, you don't control everything during a fight.
3605800	3610340	You pretty much just let the teams go at it and hope your strategic picks win the day.
3610340	3611940	Interesting.
3611940	3615980	So it's like tabs, but with Dota characters.
3616020	3619900	Well, here's the thing, if you want to know more about it, Dota two is a free game.
3619900	3623140	You know, they make their money off selling the heroes and that other stuff.
3623140	3625180	So, um, go check it out.
3625180	3629800	You have the ability to check out this mod and, uh, it'll, it'll help planet zoo.
3629800	3633540	It's a new game from the folks that did planet coaster, except now you're creating a zoo.
3633540	3634540	Oh yeah.
3634540	3635540	That look cute.
3635540	3640980	Why can't you just create both in one, you know, like a Marine world or animal kingdom
3640980	3645180	hippopotamus on a roller coaster, it's like have animals over here and your roller coasters
3645180	3646180	have it both.
3646180	3650980	You know, I guess we can't mix games, you know, I did see the zoo game that looked pretty
3650980	3651980	awesome.
3651980	3658940	Uh, Shenmue three, this game, I telling Liza looks kind of back it up, back it up.
3658940	3662780	You what you, you zip past the Shenmue three thing, like the biggest thing that everybody's
3662780	3664780	talking about from this conference was the Shenmue three thing.
3664780	3667340	Do you know what she said about Shenmue three?
3667340	3671660	What they say about it is going to be exclusive to the Epic game store for 12 months.
3671660	3672660	That's right.
3672660	3677440	So even if you did a Kickstarter backing for the game, well, that'll teach you with the
3677440	3681360	understanding that you would be getting a steam copy as they were advertising on Kickstarter
3681360	3685620	at the time, you're going to be getting it for the Epic store instead.
3685620	3686620	Lucky you.
3686620	3687620	Yeah.
3687620	3688820	So this has a lot of people not happy.
3688820	3692860	I wonder if it's going to escalate to a point, uh, with Kickstarter.
3692860	3693860	I don't know.
3693860	3695300	It's it's see, here's the thing.
3695300	3701420	I don't have as much of a like resistance against the Epic store.
3701420	3703780	I use Epic and I use steam.
3703780	3705540	I use a few others too.
3705540	3710440	Um, so for me, I'm not so bothered, but I also understand that if a person doesn't want
3710440	3712740	to have an Epic account, they have every right not to have one.
3712740	3713920	Actually, I should say this.
3713920	3714920	You know what?
3714920	3715920	I will say this.
3715920	3717660	I believe my Epic account was hacked.
3717660	3721860	Um, I'm getting all these friend requests from people I don't fricking know.
3721860	3726460	And they connected my PlayStation or they connected the account to a PlayStation account.
3726460	3727900	I'd never heard of.
3727900	3729180	And so I had to unconnect it.
3729180	3732580	And now the fricking Epic store won't let me reconnect it with my right account.
3732580	3736140	In fact, I should check on my ticket because I sent a help ticket to try to get that fixed.
3736140	3739500	But I was like, did somebody get into my Epic account?
3739500	3743820	Because I may have used the same password I use somewhere else and the other, you know
3743820	3747500	how that happens when one of those sites gets hacked and all the, the, they try to use those
3747500	3751260	username passwords other places, and it probably works for somebody on my Epic store thing.
3751260	3755100	I have since changed the password on Epic store and I believe if they have to factor
3755100	3756940	off, I turned it on as well, which I think they do.
3756940	3757940	So I turned that on.
3758180	3761460	Really, like I've just been trying to turn on two factor off, like everywhere I can.
3762260	3766660	Because I get emails all the time, all the time on my Microsoft account.
3767380	3770340	Someone keeps trying to get into my fricking Microsoft account.
3770340	3772180	Thank God I have two factor off.
3772180	3772820	Anyway.
3772820	3774660	So anyway, uh, sorry tangent.
3774660	3777860	But, um, it just goes to show that like, you know, if somebody doesn't want to have an
3777860	3780820	Epic store account, I can't say I blame them at this juncture.
3782340	3784500	Uh, Terraria's Journey's End.
3784500	3785700	It's a brand new expansion.
3785700	3787780	They said that has a ton of content in it.
3787780	3790580	So that looks, I'm, I was unaware.
3790580	3792900	They're still at, you know, adding expansions to that.
3792900	3793700	So that's pretty cool.
3794740	3800340	Um, Valfaris looks pretty cool.
3800340	3802660	It's a run and gun game similar to Contra.
3803460	3806420	And then of course, uh, Vampire the Masquerade Bloodlines 2.
3806420	3807700	They showed another trailer for that.
3807700	3808900	It looked interesting.
3808900	3811620	It looks pretty good actually, but I didn't like first person.
3812500	3815220	If they give you like a character view, I would be down for it.
3816100	3818580	Uh, they have an expansion for Warframe coming out.
3818580	3825860	Uh, I think it's Emprene and let's see what else.
3825860	3827780	Zombie Army for Dead War.
3828660	3831860	That sounds very generic and has zombies.
3832900	3834260	It looks like they have Zombie Hitler.
3835140	3835780	Of course they do.
3836900	3840340	Just a quick, I was, I was looking at my phone cause I wanted to see if Epic had responded
3840340	3843220	to the ticket I sent them and no response yet, but to be fair, it's the weekend.
3843220	3844980	So we'll give them, we'll see what happens tomorrow.
3845940	3847060	So that's all.
3847060	3847620	All right.
3847620	3848900	So the PC gaming show.
3848900	3854820	No, probably the only big like thud was the whole Shenmue 3 thing, but I don't know if
3854820	3856260	there was a lot of like what had people...
3856260	3861460	There was another game just recently that was a Kickstarter that, that was also an issue too.
3862180	3864820	I don't remember which game, what it was now, but there was another one.
3864820	3866260	It was also a Kickstarter game.
3866260	3867220	It wasn't Bloodstained.
3867220	3868180	It wasn't Bloodstained.
3868180	3871860	It was, um, it may have been a smaller title.
3871860	3875540	I don't remember, but I know we just talked about something very similar.
3876500	3881620	And it's just it, I understand it's the allure of getting more money, you know, for, you
3881620	3887140	have a larger margin there, but, um, the same time, you know, maybe you pick that for your
3887140	3888580	next game and not this one.
3888580	3893620	I don't know, but maybe it shouldn't back.
3894820	3901140	You know, it's it, no, it is making the desire to back Kickstarters harder and harder.
3901140	3906820	And I don't know if some of these companies realize how much they're like shitting in
3906820	3909780	the tank to screw it up for everybody else.
3909780	3910420	You know what I mean?
3910980	3912820	Like just, it's unfortunate.
3912820	3913700	It's really unfortunate.
3914900	3915380	All right.
3915380	3915940	All right.
3915940	3917380	So that's it for the PC gaming event.
3917380	3923140	So, um, now I did not realize Konami was doing a thing this year because I remember the year
3923140	3926100	that Konami had that clusterfuck of a press conference.
3926100	3926900	Oh yes.
3926900	3928580	That just all the lols.
3928580	3931540	That was the year they announced 99 nights too.
3931540	3934180	And the guy was like, applause, applause.
3934820	3936260	Nobody was applauding.
3936260	3936820	It's great.
3936820	3938180	Go look it up on YouTube.
3938180	3939620	What year was that?
3939620	3940900	We were at E3 that year.
3940900	3943140	We just, that was a rock revolution year too.
3943780	3947940	Uh, I thought that was the year they showed off, uh, dance, the dance connect.
3947940	3948180	Yeah.
3948180	3952180	Dance evolution and, uh, rock revolution were coming out the same year.
3952180	3952500	God.
3952500	3953300	What year was that?
3953860	3955540	2010 says orange, right?
3955540	3955940	Seriously.
3955940	3958500	Y'all go look up the YouTube Konami press conference 2010.
3960100	3960740	Oh my God.
3960740	3962100	The lols anyway.
3962100	3964500	Uh, but Konami did something a lot different this year.
3964500	3965300	It wasn't funny.
3965300	3966900	It was just one big announcement, right?
3967700	3968020	Yeah.
3968020	3976100	So they talked, um, since they, they own, um, you know, Hudson soft, um, they basically
3976100	3982500	announced that a turbo graphics 16 mini, uh, PC engine core graphics mini and PC engine
3982500	3984580	mini were going to be coming out.
3984580	3985460	I'm getting them both.
3986260	3988980	And so of course those are the three different consoles.
3988980	3990340	We're in a different region.
3990340	3990820	Hold up.
3990820	3994260	I'm surprised to hear this from you dark soccer, because usually you're the type that
3994260	3996260	says, ah, I already own it.
3997060	3998340	Well, I do.
3998340	4004820	However, um, each of them come with different games and they're, I don't think I have
4004820	4011940	superstar soldier and I would like to play a version of, uh, uh, Jacula X, um, where
4011940	4013620	I don't have to use my desk.
4014500	4015620	You know, keep it preserved.
4015620	4017220	And I've been like, ah, it's not worth it.
4017220	4017780	It's not worth it.
4017780	4018740	It's not worth it.
4018740	4022500	But the additional superstar soldier is kind of a big one for me.
4022500	4027300	And we are going to get the, um, the turbo graphics mini because it's got some good
4027300	4027700	stuff on it.
4027700	4030500	I mean, East book one and two, we've got the CDs for those.
4030500	4038340	I mean, we're talking about, um, uh, uh, we've talked about CD games on these two.
4038900	4043860	Um, and also I'd like to play our type without, cause our type for a PC engine is really
4043860	4044180	good.
4044180	4047460	I was tired of switching out hue cards cause they were too hue cards.
4047460	4049380	So it'd be nice to have it all as one game.
4049380	4054100	Like, and I think it's going to be like the, the, uh, CD version because the CD version
4054100	4054740	was one.
4054740	4059540	So, so they've got basically your usual features that we go to the mini console.
4059540	4063620	So quick saving, they've got the different display modes, emulates CRT TVs and stuff
4063620	4064340	like that.
4064580	4067460	What's kind of neat is they're going to have a multi-tap, um, support.
4067460	4070260	So you can, it will support up to five players.
4070260	4074820	Um, but you have to buy a multi-tap separately.
4074820	4080020	So, um, for the North American European regions, you're gonna be getting an alien crush,
4080020	4085780	dungeon explorer, new adventure Island, ninja spirit, our type ease book one and two, and
4085780	4087300	more titles to be announced later.
4087300	4093300	And then of course in Japan, Bonk, Castlevania, Rondo of blood, China warrior, dungeon explorer,
4093300	4097700	superstar soldier, ease book one and two, and more to be announced later on.
4097700	4098740	Why do they call it Castlevania?
4098740	4099620	It was Dracula X.
4100980	4103780	I mean, yeah, it's in the Castlevania series, but it was called Dracula X.
4103780	4109940	It could also be a Liberty on the part of the reporter who's trying to get people to
4109940	4110580	connect it.
4110580	4118500	But I guess, uh, well to that, um, it's, I think, well, let me see.
4118500	4119460	I'm just sure.
4119460	4123380	Well, even the, the SNES version they released in the U S was Dracula X.
4125380	4126020	That's right.
4126020	4126340	You're right.
4126340	4128180	There was a, I keep thinking of Castlevania five.
4128180	4129460	That was a different thing.
4129460	4130020	Yeah.
4130020	4133700	But, uh, and honestly enough though, I mean, I'm a little disappointed to see that they're
4133700	4138100	not bothering to translate it for the U S one since there's already a translation.
4139300	4144100	But, and now we know that old games will be translated when the time's right.
4144100	4147620	Like again, the trials of manna thing, go back to it's pretty amazing.
4147620	4151780	There was the Castlevania Chronicles, so it's already translated, but there is a rondo
4151780	4154500	of blood fan translation out too.
4154500	4160500	So with voice acting, well, I tried to get into their website, but it sucks ass because,
4160500	4165140	you know, they want you to enter your birth date and then it goes back to the same goddamn
4165140	4165620	page again.
4166500	4167060	Well, forget it.
4168420	4168820	All right.
4169380	4174820	So, um, I, it sounds like yet another mini console, but, uh, I, it sounds like there,
4174820	4179220	you know, especially with the games being a little more obscure for some hard to get
4179220	4181620	collectibles, we didn't get bonk over here though.
4182260	4182980	This is a little weird.
4183620	4186900	I mean, the, the game, I mean, I have, I have a feeling bunk because they said there's more
4186900	4187460	to be announced.
4187460	4188980	I think bonk is going to be among them.
4188980	4189140	Yeah.
4189140	4194180	They probably just haven't announced everything yet, but, um, but I mean the games that are
4194180	4198260	on there, like I would expect for either one of these to eventually get like Lords of thunder
4199140	4200740	because that was a big one.
4200740	4204420	I don't see any, uh, Keith courage in the alpha zones, you know?
4204420	4207140	Cause that was, that was the pack-in wasn't it?
4207140	4207640	Yeah.
4208020	4210260	Um, I don't see anything.
4210260	4211620	What were some of the other big ones?
4211620	4215940	I would imagine though the Japanese one to be really shooter heavy cause the PC engine
4215940	4222260	was really shooter heavy, but like if it's, if it's Konami, why don't we get Gradius 2?
4223060	4227300	I expect to at least see that one on the Japanese, uh, version.
4227300	4230020	Cause you know, we didn't get Gradius 2 until it came out in a pack.
4231700	4232180	All right.
4232180	4236580	Well with that, that's pretty much the end of E3 the end.
4236580	4239700	Uh, but what'd you guys think overall this year of E3?
4239700	4244420	I mean, it was a kind of a weird year with Sony not being there and you know, us knowing
4244420	4246580	that we have new consoles next year.
4246580	4249620	I've kind of been saying it's a lame duck year, you know, when you know, it's kind of
4249620	4251620	like the last year of the current iteration.
4251620	4253540	I think it's still, I think it was still good.
4253540	4258580	We still have, you know, remember we still have more announcements coming with a games
4258580	4261300	com in like a month or so.
4261300	4265300	So I mean, I'm kind of okay that Sony wasn't there.
4265300	4267140	I still think there's good games that they announced.
4267140	4269700	There's stuff to look forward to towards the end of the year.
4269700	4273220	I'm glad it's not a million games coming out like in the fourth quarter.
4273220	4275380	So now it's a million games in March.
4275380	4276900	Well, it's, it's all over the place.
4276900	4279060	So I mean, I'm fine with that.
4279060	4283300	And March is right around, we get, you know, that's payday and tax return time.
4283300	4284740	So smart.
4285540	4286980	But I don't know.
4286980	4289940	I just, I, I'm fine with the way it is.
4289940	4294180	There wasn't anything like really shocking that came out of it.
4294180	4296980	I think it's just kind of run the course.
4296980	4297700	Yeah.
4297700	4299860	Um, act depth and chat says it was an average year.
4299860	4300580	It wasn't bad.
4300580	4302420	It was quite good, but not necessarily great.
4302420	4302660	Yeah.
4302660	4304100	I'm kind of on the same page with that.
4304100	4307300	I think there were a lot of like good games, like obviously March of next year is going
4307300	4309460	to be a very, very strong month for games.
4309460	4311940	Um, March is the new November, but that's okay.
4311940	4314580	I mean, there's still a lot of games to get excited about.
4314580	4317300	And that is really what it's all about at the end of the day.
4317300	4321540	So it'd be interesting once you get to March of next year to see how well Stadia is doing.
4321540	4322020	Yeah.
4322020	4322500	Yeah.
4322500	4327860	Uh, also March of next year, uh, excuse me, not March, but next E3, uh, in television
4327860	4330740	is anticipated to give a full stage conference.
4330740	4332660	Now, what did you think of the colors that they had?
4334020	4335060	Kind of bad-ass.
4335060	4337540	Like I, the one that looks like Tron is really cool.
4337540	4340740	The woodgrain one, like they're, they're very different, unique.
4340740	4344420	Like if that's what they really look like, like there's that part of me that just has
4344420	4347780	that reservation of, is it really going to be that good?
4347780	4350820	Like, or is it a lot of talk, you know?
4350820	4353060	So I just let's see the games.
4353620	4355220	Let's see it IRL.
4355220	4357060	I, but I'm cautiously optimistic.
4357060	4358100	I think is a good way to put it.
4358100	4358420	Yeah.
4358420	4361620	But let's see what some of these games look like because, uh, in television never did
4361620	4362660	put out publicly.
4363220	4366500	Uh, I mean, I guess it was there at E3 and people were getting their hands on it, but
4366500	4369460	for whatever reason, they're not putting out footage of the games yet.
4369460	4373620	Although I did check their Twitter earlier and I guess that is coming in July.
4373620	4377460	So they do plan to put out like another teaser that will have some of the early gameplay
4377460	4378020	footage.
4378020	4381540	And then next year at E3, they're going to have a full E3 press event.
4381540	4382660	So that'll be interesting.
4382660	4388100	I'm just kind of curious how that is going to change the dynamic potentially with the
4388100	4390180	family console coming into mix.
4390180	4395060	And then I hear that VCS console, the Atari one's still being redesigned again.
4396260	4398660	That it's kind of going back to the drawing board.
4398660	4401060	Atari needs to do something to grab my attention at this point.
4401060	4403060	Cause I done forgot that that was even a thing.
4403060	4406820	So it's, it's basically like a computer now, a computer box type thing.
4406820	4407380	Cool.
4407380	4410820	But I'm not really seeing why I need to pay attention to it right now.
4410820	4410980	Yeah.
4410980	4412740	That's my honest feedback for Atari.
4412740	4414420	So, all right.
4414420	4417780	Well, um, usually at the top of the show, it was a little bit of a special week cause
4417780	4421300	we were talking about E3 and everything that happened with E3 this week, but usually at
4421300	4424340	the top of the show, we like to talk about the types of video games that we've been playing
4424340	4424900	this week.
4424900	4428500	So let's talk about our gaming weeks and how was your gaming week and what types of
4428500	4430180	video games have you been playing this week?
4430180	4431860	Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?
4431860	4438020	Um, it was really just, you know, the usual for me, it was, uh, um, Animal Crossing
4438020	4438660	Pocket Camp.
4439380	4447540	And, um, I guess trying to clean up and get everything that I can in it before, you know,
4447540	4448900	I move on to something else.
4449780	4454500	Um, Dan and I have been watching this Zelda marathon that's trying to raise some money
4454500	4455300	for something.
4455380	4459780	They have a guy with a melodica and a guy with a accordion playing during some of those
4459780	4461860	and a couple of people singing is actually pretty cute.
4462420	4466500	Um, but, uh, when we, when we, when I left the, actually, when I left the house this
4466500	4467940	morning, they were on spirit tracks.
4467940	4469940	So it gave me a chance to check out a game I hadn't played.
4470580	4473700	Um, um, I'm still doing idle pouring.
4473700	4475220	I know I don't mention it anymore.
4475220	4477220	I'm still debating quitting it.
4477220	4483540	Um, Dan and I have been working on trying to get the setup done, but we're redoing our
4483540	4483860	office.
4484740	4488900	So, um, there hasn't really been a whole lot going on because we've been in the middle
4488900	4492900	of just reorganizing the house and then with all the pride events and everything, it's
4492900	4496420	been kind of taken precedence over any other type of gaming.
4496420	4503220	But I did, I did dig, uh, dig out, not ding out the, um, uh, steam link.
4503780	4504820	See if we can get that hooked up.
4506180	4506420	Cool.
4507060	4507540	Anything else?
4508340	4508820	Uh-uh.
4508820	4509380	All right.
4509380	4510100	We'll move on.
4510100	4511140	Yeah, we'll Pokemon go.
4511940	4515620	I guess a lot of people have been doing, I guess there are, uh, the shiny amount went
4515620	4520340	way up over this past couple of days because of Pokemon go Fest, which sadly I wasn't,
4520340	4521380	obviously none of us were there.
4521380	4525700	We would probably talked about it already, but, um, I heard it was a lot of fun for those
4525700	4529220	that went except, uh, Saturday, the day that got canceled.
4529220	4533700	Um, because weather, but I guess, uh, the, the trade-off is that if you had a ticket
4533700	4539540	for Saturday, then you next week, we'll see all of the Pokemon go Fest Pokemon on your
4539540	4540980	phone, wherever you're at.
4540980	4545060	So it's interesting that Niantic has that technology within the game.
4545060	4548260	It's almost like they could just not even do an event in Chicago.
4548260	4552340	They could just say, pay 10 bucks to attend the worldwide festival and you'll see the
4552340	4554180	Pokemon wherever you're at in the world.
4554180	4555540	Be kind of, I'm fine with that.
4555540	4555780	Yeah.
4555780	4559220	I don't know how I feel about the whole pay to win element of it, but it would be an
4559220	4562580	interesting, I sit here and talk, give the money to a charity.
4562580	4566580	Then it makes it, you know, actually, yes, it lessens it a lot if you do that.
4566580	4567860	But anyway, I digress.
4567860	4568900	Loki, how was your gaming week?
4568900	4569940	I didn't play anything.
4570500	4571140	Sorry.
4571140	4571780	No, I did.
4571780	4574100	Um, I played a little bit of Pokemon go.
4574100	4579780	I found that, um, cause I had submitted a portal for a location, but it hasn't been
4579780	4581540	denied or, um, accepted yet.
4581540	4587540	Cause I guess it takes several months limbo, but the right down from where I had requested
4587540	4591300	a portal, which I think is more of a landmark than what they picked.
4591300	4595060	They picked this stupid information kiosk and put that as a portal.
4595060	4598100	Now what are you going to do?
4598100	4599060	Stop new.
4599060	4599300	Yeah.
4599300	4603540	It's, it's right across, like literally within distance of the Starbucks is there.
4603540	4608420	But if they put that as one, then I think what I submitted should be good, but yeah,
4608420	4609300	no way it takes time.
4609300	4609700	It's fine.
4610580	4616420	Starbucks is, is that in the shopping center with the, um, uh, Vietnam Memorial?
4617460	4624180	Uh, no, it's the shopping center by my work where I take my kid.
4624180	4624660	Yes.
4624660	4624900	Okay.
4625700	4631940	We don't want to give away everything, but the one that I was mentioning is like an enemy
4631940	4632500	players.
4632500	4637700	They're, they're very clearly won it for some reason and they bump it a lot.
4637700	4639780	So anyway, that's why I was like, can I get a new portal there?
4639780	4640900	Cause that's a problem.
4640900	4642980	No, but there's new, there's new stores going in over there.
4642980	4647540	So they're, they may try to choose bargain anyway.
4647540	4647940	Yes.
4647940	4652420	Um, so I, but I did work on, uh, programming a little bit for a couple hours.
4652420	4657620	So I did that and I posted a, a funny little video on, on, uh, Twitter.
4658260	4659780	Um, I met the place stuff this week.
4659780	4662260	Actually, I met the place up earlier this afternoon.
4662260	4668180	I downloaded our purchase and downloaded the Lego expansion for, um, Forza Horizon 4.
4668740	4673940	And it looks amazing, but I had a killer migraine earlier this afternoon.
4673940	4680340	So instead of playing the game because my kids were being very loud and obnoxious, I
4680340	4684740	decided to lay in a dark room with my head on a pillow waiting for the pain to go away.
4685940	4687460	So that's what I did instead.
4687460	4692180	But I intend to play that and I've got, um, you know, my wife's going to be out of town
4692180	4695460	this week, so that means I can stream possibly later at night.
4695460	4700980	So I may end up streaming some Forza Horizon 4, uh, with the Lego DLC stuff because it
4700980	4701620	looks amazing.
4702260	4702980	Like, absolutely.
4702980	4705540	Like that needs to be a full, they just need to make a full game of that.
4705540	4708820	Well, you know, Bobby was just talking about it on his show cause I guess he played it
4708820	4710420	and he says, I see why they didn't make it a full game.
4710420	4714180	I guess there's, there are parts that aren't quite as filled out as others, but, um, they
4714180	4715460	should fill it out.
4715460	4716100	Okay.
4716100	4718420	Anyway, um, let me talk about my gaming week.
4718420	4722660	So I, I did, uh, make an effort to try to play some games, uh, that I haven't played
4722660	4722980	yet.
4722980	4726740	Uh, now not to say I didn't play my normal stuff cause I've still played Diablo three.
4726740	4732580	I just got my silver season badge unlocked cause I, I, uh, beat a set dungeon was the
4732580	4733300	last thing I needed.
4733300	4734980	So now I'm working on my gold badge.
4734980	4737780	So there's that, uh, I'm up to Paragon 180.
4737780	4738740	So I'm doing pretty good.
4738740	4742100	Um, usually you have to be a little bit further before you get silver, but I'm doing pretty
4742100	4742500	good.
4742500	4745700	And then of course, continuing to play Final Fantasy 14 gearing up for the expansion.
4745700	4750500	I'm trying to get my machinist to level 70 because those abilities with the new machinist
4750500	4755620	and, um, uh, I keep wanting to say storm blood, but that's the current expansion shadow bringers.
4755620	4760340	I'm really excited about being able to, uh, use some of those newer abilities.
4760340	4762660	So, um, yeah, I want to get my machinist to 70.
4762660	4764260	So that's the stuff I've been playing.
4764260	4768580	Now, some new stuff, uh, I went, well, I went back to Beat Saber, but the reason why is
4768580	4772420	because they released a pack for Beat Saber.
4772420	4775700	That is 10 Imagine Dragons songs.
4775700	4776100	That's right.
4776100	4779780	The band, Imagine Dragons, they put their songs in Beat Saber, which I have to admit
4779780	4784420	at first, I was a little bit like, this is weird because that's not the usual type of
4784420	4786580	song that you have in Beat Saber.
4786580	4787940	But I think that's the point.
4787940	4790180	They want to put different types of songs into Beat Saber.
4790180	4794020	Keep in mind, I don't play on the PC where I understand the game has been modded to hell
4794020	4795620	and every song you can think of is in it.
4795620	4800740	But, um, I kind of agree with Bobby on this, the modding community, most of the time, not
4800740	4806100	all the time, wants to just flex their pain on how difficult can we make these songs.
4806100	4808660	And that's not fun for me.
4808660	4813540	Fun for some of you Beat Saber experts, but those of us that can't move that fast, it's
4813540	4814500	just not as fun.
4814500	4815940	Like I watch other people do it.
4815940	4816260	Neat.
4816260	4816740	I agree.
4816740	4818420	It's like the DDR community.
4818420	4823460	It's basically, this is why it is the DDR thing all over again.
4823460	4825700	It's why In the Groove was so hard.
4825700	4832100	It's why the new songs that seem to come out from Konami on the new DDR games are so
4832100	4836580	goddamn hard is because that's where a lot of players want to play.
4837220	4840420	But sometimes, you know, it's just fun just to play a song.
4840420	4844500	It's sometimes fun when the hand waves go with the drum beat and you can almost like
4844500	4845140	freestyle a little bit.
4845140	4845780	Oh yes, that's right.
4845780	4850980	I did play DDR this week in a 111 degree garage and I regretted it immediately.
4851940	4852900	And I streamed it though.
4852980	4853940	So yeah.
4854820	4859700	Anyway, so yeah, Metal Mayhem in chat says Imagine Dragons has nine songs above and beyond
4859700	4860660	Radioactive.
4860660	4861940	That was kind of my first thing too.
4861940	4866900	And that song in particular Radioactive is just, it's been played to death on the radio.
4866900	4869380	And let me tell you what really bugs me about that song.
4870100	4874260	Not to shit on Imagine Dragons because actually they've done a lot of like wonderful, awesome
4874260	4875620	things for the LGBTQ community.
4875620	4876740	So I give them a big thumbs up.
4876740	4881140	They are very actively involved with that because I guess the guy is a Mormon, was a
4881140	4885220	Mormon, and has worked a lot with Mormons and the coming out thing.
4885220	4886820	So thumbs up to you, dude.
4886820	4888340	I'm not going to talk a lot of shit.
4888340	4892580	But that song Radioactive, the part that bugs me is that there's some line in it that says
4893380	4900580	I inhale the chemicals and there's like a clip of him taking a big breath.
4900580	4904340	And I'm like, oh God, that's like listening to somebody chew their food very loudly.
4905140	4906340	Why is that in a song?
4906340	4909300	And I always want to change the channel when I hear that on the radio.
4909940	4913780	But that song aside, some of their other songs are actually pretty good.
4913780	4914420	I like that.
4914420	4917380	Like there's a song, it's the very first one, Bad Liar, I think it's called.
4917380	4921860	That's like a slow song and it's got a nice little, it's got a good hook to it.
4921860	4923300	And it's like a slow jam.
4923300	4926900	So it's weird to play it in Beat Saber, but I'm kind of like, I'm kind of into this.
4926900	4933220	Like it does what DDR did to some of those slower songs.
4933220	4937220	And it's like, it invented its own beat to go with the song.
4937300	4944900	And the way you kind of like make your own beat is kind of enhances the song a little bit.
4944900	4947780	So I thought the note chart to that was a lot of fun.
4947780	4949380	So that's probably my favorite song to play right now.
4950020	4950420	All right.
4950420	4950820	Yeah.
4950820	4951540	So I enjoyed that.
4953060	4953460	Let's see.
4954020	4958100	Going to our chat over Twitch TV slash vog network.
4958820	4961860	Dark Tetsuya says Radioactive just reminds me of USL.
4961860	4964660	Travis used to play that song all the time on his Twitch days.
4964660	4966100	Oh, he did, didn't he?
4966100	4966820	That's right.
4966820	4968580	I think there might've been like a parody or something too.
4969540	4969940	Let's see.
4970580	4974100	SJ100Matt talks about music game elitist across all platforms.
4974100	4974340	Yep.
4974340	4974660	Yep.
4974660	4975460	It happens.
4975460	4978420	Bobby Blackwolf reminds us Imagine Dragons are all drummers too.
4978420	4982820	So it worked a lot better, but I doubt they designed the beat charts, but sure.
4982820	4986900	Some of their songs probably lent themselves pretty well to the game because of that.
4986900	4990660	Anyway, if you sample the songs, they're obviously all over YouTube.
4990660	4992660	It's all of the like Imagine Dragons singles.
4993620	4998100	Go look it up on YouTube and you'll probably make a decision if it's for you.
4998100	4999620	Cause I think it's kind of nice.
4999620	5001780	Anyway, other games I played.
5001780	5004180	Trials of Mana I played quite a bit of this week.
5004180	5006980	I already talked about that a little bit earlier in the show, so I won't recap too much.
5006980	5009780	But I streamed probably about two and a half hours of me playing it.
5009780	5012740	And yeah, I'm having fun enjoying that game.
5012740	5016580	It's kind of interesting to revisit like Secret of Mana, but it's not Secret of Mana.
5017380	5021780	And I'm having to adjust to the Super Nintendo way of playing things where
5021780	5024340	sometimes things are a little bit clunkier and a little bit slower.
5024340	5027460	Cause it battles we're not 60 frames a second like they are today.
5027460	5028980	So, you know, it's taking a little bit of getting used to.
5028980	5033940	But otherwise I'm really enjoying, otherwise I'm really enjoying like again,
5033940	5037460	I am able to look at this game and go, wow, for considering the age of this game,
5037460	5039940	the fact that it has like the branching storylines
5039940	5043060	and the multiple beginnings of the game is kind of neat.
5043060	5045140	Like, you know, you didn't see that in a lot of games back then.
5045140	5046020	So that was pretty cool.
5047700	5050100	And then the last game I played a bit of this week,
5050100	5054020	because I bought that Xbox ultimate game pass, I should probably try something with it.
5054020	5057300	So I played a game called Riverbond, which is like, it's like,
5057300	5059220	it's like got like a voxel art style.
5059220	5063780	So kind of like Minecraft VR style, but it's kind of like a platformer slash.
5063780	5068500	You have like a sword and you have like a gun that you can shoot the other voxels with.
5068500	5071060	So it's kind of like, that's a little bit of a platformer slash shooter
5071060	5072340	adventure type of game.
5072340	5074100	And it's, it's fine.
5074100	5076980	I haven't played a lot of it, but so far it's, you know, it's,
5077060	5081700	I like that you can change your main character to all these really different random things.
5081700	5083860	So I've been playing as the eggplant emoji,
5084820	5086820	because that's something you can play the game as.
5086820	5087540	So why not?
5087540	5089060	Don't shake your head at me, dark soccer.
5089060	5089700	You know, it's funny.
5089700	5089940	All right.
5090820	5091780	It is pretty funny.
5091780	5094340	It's a, an amused head shake.
5094340	5097460	Now I will point out, because somebody tweeted me or emailed about this.
5097460	5100980	I don't remember, but the next game I downloaded, I just haven't played it yet.
5100980	5104980	I did download Supermarket Shriek, and I'm really excited to play that because that is.
5104980	5106420	Oh, I do want to play that.
5107300	5111140	And I didn't realize, apparently that is a game that you can partially control with your voice.
5111700	5113060	I didn't know that was the thing.
5113060	5114020	That's even better.
5114020	5115780	That's why it's called Supermarket Shriek.
5115780	5117860	So I'm, I'm, I'm gonna figure this out.
5117860	5119220	Maybe I'll, maybe I'll do a live stream.
5119220	5119700	We'll see.
5119700	5123140	And I'll check that out this coming week, but that's the next game on a game pass ultimate.
5123140	5124100	I'm going to take a look at it.
5124100	5127780	I wanted, yeah, I do want to play like some more of these games.
5127780	5132180	I wish I almost had the Xbox to like play that stuff, but I don't want to get an Xbox at this
5132180	5135140	point, you know, not with the next console being right around the corner.
5135140	5135940	Yeah, that's true.
5135940	5136500	I understand.
5136500	5137620	Do you kind of wait for that?
5137620	5141300	Plus I have a PC, but like, you know, I understand.
5141300	5141800	All right.
5142260	5146420	Moving on, let's, let's go, let's go back to a time, you know, every week on this show,
5146420	5150740	we take a look back and as much as we've discussed all the new stuff up to March,
5150740	5155620	2020 through this year's E3, sometimes it's nice to revisit the classics and a segment
5155620	5157220	we call the classic game of the week.
5157220	5160260	And the way the classic game of the week works is that dark soccer is going to step into
5160260	5165540	the gaming vault and find a game that she thinks, Hey, this game is 10 years old or more.
5166260	5167540	This one's the or more.
5167540	5170500	This one's are more, this one's about 20 in it.
5170500	5171300	Close to it.
5171300	5171800	Yeah.
5172020	5174020	Cause it came out in November, 2000.
5174020	5174580	Okay.
5174580	5175620	So yeah, close to it.
5175620	5178260	So, uh, this is one that you kids need to be revisiting.
5178260	5180340	And I got to say it's, it's, it's so funny.
5180340	5183220	Cause dark soccer wasn't at her computer when she was picking the game this week.
5183220	5184660	So she's like, I want to do this game.
5184660	5185780	I'm like, you already did that one.
5185780	5187140	And I was going obscure too.
5187140	5187640	Yeah.
5187860	5188900	You already did that one.
5188900	5192020	And then she picked this one and I was like, okay, she had to have done this game.
5192020	5194820	And I was like, Oh my God, how has dark soccer not done this game?
5194820	5197060	This game is legendary.
5197060	5198020	So let's get to it.
5198020	5200740	What is the classic game of the week this week?
5200740	5201940	I picked sin and punishment.
5202980	5207700	So basically it is a rail shooter slash shooting gallery game.
5207700	5210820	It was a code developed by treasure and Nintendo.
5210820	5211860	You know, it's treasure.
5211860	5214980	It's gotta be freaking amaze balls.
5214980	5221220	So it was published for the Nintendo 64 in 2000 and it takes place in the dystopian
5221220	5224340	2007 because famine.
5224900	5231780	And shit, but at any rate, um, uh, basically scientists have created a new species to raise
5231780	5234900	this food, but of course there's things science shouldn't do.
5234900	5239300	The species all, you know, mutate and go back and everything.
5239860	5245540	So it has, um, the game is actually a unique one.
5246180	5251060	Basically it, it is, um, you have two players, sake and IDON.
5251700	5257460	But it uses a different layout for the Nintendo 64 controller.
5257460	5264340	So it uses both the D pad and the control stick and it lets you strafe, jump and dodge
5264340	5268180	on the screen while aiming your target.
5269060	5273620	So you have to shoot at enemies and projectiles while dodging the attacks to progress through
5273620	5274120	the game.
5274680	5281480	So at any rate, um, this particular game had some of the longest development time for a
5281480	5282600	game of its time.
5283320	5293480	Um, it, uh, it started in 1997 with only four people on staff and, uh, basically it concluded
5293480	5300680	in 2000 with more people that were involved in any of other treasures, um, previous projects.
5301320	5307720	And it wanted to develop Sin and Punishment, um, with the design of the Nintendo 64 controller
5307720	5313240	in mind, but they wanted to make a game where you hold the left side of the controller instead
5313240	5316520	of the right side of the controller, which was average for most games.
5317400	5323960	So they had some difficulty programming the game, the 3D rendering of the machine and
5323960	5328520	trying to adapt 2D gameplay into the 3D environment was kind of weird.
5328520	5332520	And the game was originally called Glass Soldier, but Nintendo renamed it to Sin and
5332520	5335960	Punishment because they wanted to have a name that would stand out.
5337000	5339640	It was released to pretty positive reviews.
5340280	5347400	Um, it was, uh, definitely lauded for its high intensity and flashy graphics for its
5347400	5347900	time.
5348360	5352760	And then, um, a few even pointed out that Treasure has this amazing ability to reduce
5352840	5359720	their polygon count to maintain smooth gameplay, but keeping the graphics stylish, quote, quote,
5359720	5360220	quote.
5361320	5365880	Anyway, um, it was never released in the West, um, and it did get a pretty big following
5365880	5366920	among import gamers.
5366920	5369800	This is one that I never actually imported, but we had talked about.
5370520	5375720	Um, and eventually people really started demanding it for the Virtual Console.
5375720	5382040	So finally we had a Western release in 2007 for the Virtual Console and it is considered
5382040	5385560	one of the best Nintendo 64 games ever.
5385560	5388680	And it also was, uh, ported to the IQ player in China.
5388680	5389800	You know the IQ is, right?
5391240	5392520	Not the intelligent cube.
5392520	5393000	Okay.
5393000	5394680	It's I Q U E.
5395400	5400120	So in China, they had passed a law that made video game consoles illegal.
5400120	5404120	So the IQ was released as sort of, uh, a handheld unit.
5404120	5409000	It wasn't a console and it came with different Nintendo 64 games that you could download
5409000	5413800	through a service or, you know, a few of them came pre-installed.
5413800	5416360	So it's basically a handheld Nintendo 64.
5417160	5423240	So anyway, um, it did have a sequel for the Wii in 2009 called Sin and Punishment Star
5423800	5424440	Successor.
5425480	5432680	Um, at any rate, um, it got great reviews all over the world and it was even reviewed,
5432680	5435400	um, by Western, uh, gaming magazines.
5435720	5442440	Like IGN just said it was, you know, a, and I'm going to use a quote, a tour de force
5442440	5444280	of arcade style shooting action.
5445160	5450280	And of course treasure has always been lauded for their, their, you know, just massively
5450280	5451640	wonderful games.
5451640	5458440	Um, uh, Eurogamer gave it a, um, a score of nine out of 10.
5458440	5462280	Hamitsu said 35 out of 40, which is pretty good for Hamitsu.
5462920	5467320	Um, but yeah, it got just really high ratings all over the place.
5467320	5472040	A retro gamer, which is, uh, a magazine that I was collecting for a little while.
5472520	5476760	Um, I like that when you had on the cover it have, you know, where it always says new
5476760	5480760	there said old, we have a bunch of retro gamers.
5480760	5485800	Um, but it listed Sin and Punishment on, uh, toward the top of their list in the top 10
5485800	5493720	Nintendo 64 games with its intensity and, uh, the, uh, level of sophistication in their
5493720	5494920	graphics.
5494920	5502040	Um, and, um, it's one of the, this is one of the best games among shooting gallery games
5502040	5503960	along with wild guns from 1984.
5504600	5510520	Um, there was a novelization of the game that was released in Japan and, um, a comic that
5510520	5520520	was, uh, printed in Dengeki Daioh magazine where Saki, um, was, uh, sorry, I was skipping
5520520	5520840	on a bit.
5520840	5525160	The character Saki appeared as an assist trophy in Super Smash Brothers Brawl.
5526360	5532840	And, um, and then of course there was the sequel for Wii in 2009, Sin and Punishment
5532840	5533560	Star Successor.
5534440	5542440	Um, so the, uh, the Japanese name is, hold on, I miss reading that.
5542440	5544760	This is, they, they mispronounced this.
5544760	5546520	Hoshito Keishousha.
5547480	5549560	Um, so Sin and Punishment.
5549560	5550200	So there you go.
5552040	5552440	That's it.
5554200	5554760	All right.
5554760	5557640	The classic game of the week and punishment.
5557640	5558840	I'm sorry, I had the name wrong.
5558840	5560040	Sumitobatsu.
5560040	5562600	And it was Hoshino Keishousha.
5562600	5569080	So the thing about this is that they changed, um, Chikyu to Hoshi because it's a different
5569080	5571000	reading for the same Kanji.
5571000	5578200	Um, so it was a big thing because it was called Earth Successor, but they changed the pronunciation
5578200	5578680	of it.
5578680	5581880	So anyway, I was misreading it because I knew that that wasn't the words.
5581880	5585720	No worries, but what a great, you know, again, what we're looking at here, I think what we
5585720	5588760	actually pulled the video from here for Twitch, for those of you that are watching along tonight,
5588760	5593800	I think this is actually, uh, like on the Wii playing the N64 version of it.
5593800	5598520	So I don't know if they enhanced it at all, but for an N64 game, this looks great.
5598520	5600600	You know, you have to remember this is like a 20 year old game.
5600600	5603880	And this was, I actually do believe it looks this good on Nintendo 64.
5603880	5605320	I remember it being a good looking game.
5605320	5606840	It has been a long time.
5606840	5611000	Star Successor was even better, which is funny because let me go back to the studio shot
5611000	5615400	here, but I remember when, um, Sin and Punishment Star Successor was announced and you like,
5615400	5616840	were really excited about that.
5616840	5617720	Obviously.
5617720	5619480	Um, I kind of hope they do another one.
5619480	5623560	I mean, if we're going to go revisit Panzer Dragoon, why not a Sin and Punishment 3?
5623560	5624520	I think that'd be pretty awesome.
5624520	5628120	It just might be hard to get the band back together to do it, but the switch is doing
5628120	5628600	well enough.
5628600	5629560	It might necessitate it.
5629560	5630120	Right.
5630120	5631320	Yeah, possibly.
5631320	5635800	Maybe it'll be included with the Nintendo 64 classic edition whenever they do that.
5635800	5637240	We never lose hope.
5637240	5639800	We need more joy from a treasure anyway.
5639800	5641400	Yeah, this treasure is happiness.
5642040	5642520	All right.
5642520	5646280	Well, um, we're going to get to our next segment here in a moment, but since we are, um, coming
5646280	5649960	to a studio break here while we do this, uh, prior recorded segment, um, Dark Soccer,
5649960	5652840	I know you have to leave us a little early tonight cause you have a work obligation really
5652840	5653640	early in the morning.
5653640	5654360	Fucking A.
5654360	5654600	Yeah.
5654600	5654920	Sorry to hear it.
5654920	5658440	Basically, I've got training at work on Monday and Tuesday, which requires me to be up at
5658440	5659560	five fucking 30 in the morning.
5659560	5662280	Which is funny because I'm a trainer and I'm like, there's no way in hell I'd have class
5662280	5663240	that early, but you're coming.
5663240	5664520	Class starts at seven.
5664520	5665800	Oh, yeah, but you gotta get up.
5665800	5666760	I have to get up.
5666760	5667560	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
5667560	5669080	Cause it takes me about an hour to get ready.
5669080	5673240	I mean, I can push it and get up at six, but I will look like, you know, the swamp monster.
5673240	5675960	You got to put your face on, beat your face.
5675960	5677240	Yeah, I understand.
5677800	5679800	There's some days it's war paint.
5681240	5681720	All right.
5681720	5685640	Well, uh, before we let you go and say good night, Dark Soccer, um, first off, um, anything
5685640	5688440	you want to say about E3 this year or something like you're really looking forward to, and
5688440	5696040	then just any last thoughts for animal crossing bitches, aminal, animals crossing zoos makes
5696040	5697000	me happy.
5697000	5699880	Also eating cinnamon buns during the show made me happy too.
5700520	5700680	Yeah.
5700680	5701880	The cinnamon rolls are great.
5701880	5702920	It's fucking IKEA.
5702920	5704760	IKEA has the best.
5704760	5706040	I know you, you had sent me that text.
5706040	5707480	Like you want me to bring you any food from IKEA?
5707480	5709000	And I was like, don't bring like meatballs.
5709000	5710280	They're not going to hold the whole trip here.
5710280	5711800	I'm like, bitch, I'm talking cinnamon rolls.
5711800	5712040	Yeah, I know.
5712040	5713160	But then you were like cinnamon rolls.
5713160	5715960	I was like, Ooh, things I didn't know I need until she said it.
5715960	5716680	I bought two trays.
5716680	5717720	So I have a tray at home.
5717720	5718040	All right.
5718040	5719720	Well, um, have a great rest of your night, Dark Soccer.
5719720	5724200	And we'll see you back here in seven days to celebrate 17 years of orange launch radio.
5724200	5726280	If you can believe it next week.
5726280	5731080	But you know, I'm glad that it's that weekend cause I'm going to be gone for San Francisco
5731080	5731560	pride.
5732280	5733720	Oh, the next weekend, right?
5733720	5734120	Yeah.
5734120	5735720	Cause I'm marching.
5735720	5737800	We, I'm going to kind of decide.
5737800	5741720	I just found out, I think Bobby's going to be gone that week and we're going to be up
5741720	5748360	in Reno cause I don't want to brag, but I have VIP tickets to see Carly Rae Jepsen that
5748360	5748920	Saturday.
5750360	5752840	So, uh, up in Reno.
5752840	5757560	So instead of going to SF pride, I'm going to Reno girl, but I'm going to a Carly Rae
5757560	5759320	Jepsen concert, which is basically gay pride.
5759320	5760040	Come on.
5760120	5761560	So, uh, I'm going to that.
5761560	5764920	And then, so there's a part of me, it's like, eh, why rush home from Reno to do the show?
5764920	5767560	Maybe, maybe we'll, uh, so if you're not going to be here, I don't know.
5767560	5767960	We'll see.
5767960	5768280	We'll see.
5768280	5770440	I feel more time to yourself.
5772440	5772920	We'll see.
5772920	5773160	I don't know.
5773160	5773720	We'll talk about it.
5773720	5775480	We'll talk about it in this coming week and see what we do.
5775480	5778120	We can also record something in advance, like quickly or something.
5778120	5779640	And who does that anymore?
5779640	5781960	Um, well, I don't know what you can do on Twitch.
5781960	5782200	All right.
5782200	5786520	Anyway, I'll do this show myself or we experience that.
5786520	5792600	I want everyone to pray for me and this has nothing to do with my training, but I have
5792600	5802440	finally sat down and I'm learning logic pro so that I can do a podcast using the, um,
5802440	5804040	the soundboard in logic pro.
5805080	5807560	So pray for me, I'm, I'm learning it so far.
5807560	5809640	I have made a really weird loop track.
5809640	5809800	Good.
5809800	5812360	And then what you learn, you can come over to this show and use.
5812360	5815720	Well, I'm still planning on working on a theme song for us.
5816280	5819080	Instead of, you know, something that doesn't sound like it's a dungeon crawler theme.
5819080	5821400	I, Hey, now I sent you that track though.
5821400	5822040	It sounded good.
5822040	5823880	Oh, I thought you're, you're teasing the midi head thing.
5823880	5824360	And I'm like that.
5824360	5824920	No, no, no.
5824920	5826040	I'm talking about mine.
5826040	5826440	Oh no.
5826440	5828920	You remember the first one that I made learning garage.
5828920	5831000	Maybe you were like, here, what do you think about this for an OLR intro?
5831000	5835800	And I was like, no, no, no, not that I did another one for an OLR intro, but I did one
5835800	5838840	that I sent you that sounds like it's a cave video game theme.
5838840	5842120	And I was like, I love that you're expressing your art.
5843000	5845720	I'm not sure it's the right fit for a show intro.
5845720	5846680	It's not peppy enough.
5846680	5851240	I need, no, I need to send, I, I, I, I kind of want to play it at some point for people
5851240	5855800	just to get some feedback, but yeah, it's, I'm, I'm learning my way through that and
5855800	5859160	there's better loops, uh, available in logic.
5859160	5860040	All right, cool.
5860600	5861000	All right.
5861000	5862280	Well, we'll see you next week.
5862280	5866600	Uh, in the meantime, we're going to go to a prior recorded segment earlier where I sat
5866600	5870600	down with some of the, uh, Pokemon biggest Pokemon fans here at the voice geeks network
5871000	5875560	to talk a little bit about some of this news when it comes to Pokemon generation eight.
5875560	5878760	But, um, just a quick FYI guys, and I'm going to apologize in advance.
5878760	5883720	I, the audio for this kind of got screwed up a little bit and my voice is much louder
5883720	5885240	than the other people's voices.
5885240	5886280	So I'm really sorry about that.
5886280	5888520	That was a fail on my part, not on their part.
5888520	5891160	Because I was using the same setup I use for game streaming.
5891160	5894280	And usually I have the audio down on the game so I can talk over that.
5894280	5899240	And oops, it meant, so I'm going to try to fix it for the podcast, but just so you guys
5899240	5903240	know, um, just, it may sound a little off here as we air it live.
5903240	5906920	And I apologize for that, but please listen to what our guests tonight have to say here
5906920	5909240	about the Pokemon gen eight controversy.
5910760	5911160	Okay.
5911160	5915160	So I thought for our studio break this week, we could do something a little different.
5915160	5919480	Usually I'm like playing a game or something here and no, I'm not playing Pokemon sword
5919480	5921480	and shield, which is what's showing behind me.
5921480	5925080	But I thought, uh, this is actually just the Nintendo direct, uh, from a few days ago,
5925080	5926440	a couple of weeks, I guess at this point.
5926600	5930440	But I thought what we could do is actually talk about kind of a little bit of controversy
5930440	5934440	that came up about Pokemon generation eight, uh, from this year's E3 announcements.
5934440	5938920	And I thought, you know, to talk about this, why don't we invite on some Pokemon fans from
5938920	5940120	around the voice of geeks network?
5940120	5944360	So I'm joined tonight by of course, of course, if Pokemon comes up on orange launch radio,
5944360	5945480	of course, Shane's going to be here.
5945480	5945960	Hi, Shane.
5946760	5947480	Hello.
5947480	5948200	Hey, how are you doing?
5949160	5950120	I'm fine.
5950120	5950760	Good.
5950760	5954840	And also joining Shane and I tonight, uh, you also know from the voice geeks network
5954840	5958360	from the show game buoy, but you might've also heard, uh, another show that this guy
5958360	5961560	was on called stab cast for same type attack bonus.
5961560	5962680	Say hello to first mate.
5962680	5963240	Slide kick.
5964200	5965880	Hi, how are you?
5967160	5967960	I'm all right.
5967960	5968360	Just good.
5968360	5971000	I'm ready to talk about some Pokemans.
5971000	5971240	Yeah.
5971240	5972120	Let's talk about it.
5972120	5977160	So, um, so I guess let me try to like summarize this in a nutshell and Shane, as usual, you
5977160	5978600	can correct everything that I got wrong.
5978600	5979000	Okay.
5979000	5980200	Um, so okay.
5980200	5982440	I'm ready to do so.
5983560	5983960	Okay.
5984040	5988680	So here's the deal is that my understanding, at least, you know, I, I like Pokemon, but
5988680	5991880	I don't buy 17 copies of the game like you do, Shane.
5991880	5994120	Um, but my understand, okay, here's my understanding.
5994120	5998040	So there's a lot of like cool stuff about Pokemon sword and shield and Jenny.
5998040	6001960	And that is that, you know, um, you're going to have like, what is it like random encounters
6001960	6003800	mixed with encounters that you see in the wild.
6003800	6004040	Right.
6004040	6008520	So you can like actually encounters plus your random encounters still.
6008520	6011800	And there's yeah, there's what they want there.
6011800	6014760	And there's, um, like a 3d world, which looks really cool to me.
6014760	6018760	I liked the way the space looked like, instead of like just a 2d map, it looked a little
6018760	6021880	bit more like, I don't know, yeah, it looked pretty cool.
6021880	6024520	So anyway, but here's the controversial part.
6024520	6025960	If y'all haven't heard yet.
6025960	6030680	So what's happening is that of course, Pokemon kind of brands itself as the game as got to
6030680	6031400	catch them all.
6031400	6031640	Right.
6031640	6037240	And at this point, now that we're eight generations in, we're looking at over 800 Pokemon are
6037240	6040760	going to exist in the universe by the time this game comes out.
6040760	6045640	So one thing that was announced is that, uh, in this game, you're only going to be able
6045640	6050440	to catch Pokemon that are part of the Galar regional decks.
6050440	6054200	And that doesn't necessarily mean it's just the new Pokemon.
6054200	6058280	There are some old Pokemon mixed in there, and we even see it, uh, in this direct, we
6058280	6062520	see some, you know, notable, like I saw Raichu go by a minute ago, obviously Charizard's
6062520	6063480	back there right now.
6063480	6068360	So we know some of the old Pokemon will be back, but not all of the old Pokemon will
6068360	6068840	be back.
6068840	6072120	And this is causing quite a bit of controversy.
6072120	6074040	So let me start with Shane.
6074040	6075080	What's your angle?
6075080	6076200	Well, first, did I get it right?
6076200	6077720	And B, what's your angle on all this?
6077720	6081320	So yeah, you, you basically got it right.
6081320	6089160	What they're saying is that what they have basically curated to be the Pokemon in the
6089160	6095480	Galar region, um, that's it, nothing else can come in no matter what.
6096360	6100360	In old games like Sun and Moon, um, which we briefly talked about, uh, before the call
6100360	6106520	started, uh, you had your regional decks, which is everything you can catch in Sun and
6106520	6107240	Moon.
6107240	6109640	And then in most games you had a national decks.
6109640	6114520	You didn't in this one, which was fine, but because you could still bring your old Pokemon
6114520	6120280	from black and white, from Ruby Sapphire, from X and Y, all those, you could still bring
6120280	6122360	in at a certain point in the game.
6122360	6127800	Basically, uh, I couldn't, I don't remember if it was after you were done or just whenever
6127800	6129000	you had access to bank.
6129000	6132600	It's, it's been a while since I played Sun and Moon cause it's not that great.
6132600	6136360	Um, but in this one, you can't do that at all.
6136360	6139720	So my feelings, I was torn at first.
6139720	6141400	Oh no, I wasn't torn at first.
6141400	6143000	I didn't care at first.
6143000	6149640	Um, I have a living decks in Pokemon bank, uh, that I don't want to say I worked hard
6149640	6150120	to make.
6150120	6151880	It wasn't that bad really.
6151880	6157800	Um, and I've been working on shinies for years and not being able to bring them all over
6159080	6164680	to me personally, I don't mind it for how I play the game.
6165560	6169240	But wait quickly, how do, how quickly, how do you play the game?
6169800	6170440	Summarize that.
6171240	6176760	So I just, I, I play the game from start to finish, like just by catching what's there.
6176760	6183080	I don't import anything over unless I'm specifically trying to do something like I made a team
6183080	6188920	of smear goal for ultra Sun and ultra Moon so I could catch shinies easier.
6188920	6193560	Um, but beyond that, it's not like I have some Pokemon that I've had for forever.
6193560	6199560	I have, uh, I have a Pokemon from my original copy of diamond.
6199560	6203880	I think it was that I've carried over since then.
6203880	6209960	Um, so that's years and years at this point, but I don't use them in any post game things.
6209960	6211720	I use them basically for breeding.
6211720	6216600	If I need to, even my beloved Oshawa, I don't bring them over.
6216600	6220600	It's not unless I'm hatching or something like that.
6220600	6222360	It's not that big of a deal to me.
6222360	6224760	So you're, so you're, you're at peace with this.
6224760	6227880	You're, you did not participate in the rabble rabble or, or.
6228840	6237560	So no, I did not participate in all the angry people mob thing, but like after a little
6237560	6244520	bit of reflection and reading some stories, I, well, I'm not personally affected by this.
6244520	6250200	I am upset for the people that are, and I do want them to change their stance.
6250760	6257320	Um, I read a story about some guy who traded Pokemon with his friend when they were younger
6257320	6260600	and his friend got terminally ill and gave him all his Pokemon.
6260600	6261800	That friend died.
6261800	6268120	And now those Pokemon technically have outlived how old that person's friend was.
6268120	6273320	Uh, by the time that they had passed away, I'm like, okay, well, some, a story like that
6273320	6277720	makes me realize, Hey, some of these mean more to people than they do to me.
6277720	6281880	And so they shouldn't like be upset about this.
6281880	6284280	They should, they should get what they want out of it.
6284280	6287320	Well, let me, let me ask John a question too, because I definitely want to hear your take
6287320	6288200	on this too, John.
6288200	6293560	Um, I know there's been a lot of, there's been a lot of rabble rabble as I described
6293560	6299320	it on Twitter so far as, you know, we saw a good old change.org petition, uh, asking
6299320	6303000	for Nintendo to reverse their decision on this and change this.
6303000	6304520	What's your take on all this, John?
6304520	6307960	How did you feel when you were like seeing this petition and hearing all this news?
6308200	6313560	I mean, honestly, it's, it's, you know, it made me think of, uh, you know, you and I
6313560	6318760	do a show reading is fundamental about RuPaul's Drag Race, which, you know, for quite a few
6318760	6323240	years now has had a lot of fans behaving badly.
6323800	6329800	And I mean, I haven't really followed like the, I mean, I, I can't say I haven't followed
6329800	6330600	the Pokemon fandom.
6330600	6336920	I've been, you know, on Pokemon, like web forums since I was in high school and everything.
6337880	6342280	But like, you know, in terms of like, you know, especially these days with like social
6342280	6347880	media and everything and Reddit, like I don't really, um, typically have a pulse on what
6347880	6355000	the Pokemon fandom is like these days, but it, I mean, I kind of thought that, you know,
6355000	6363400	it seemed like a decent community, but, uh, I just think people are, um, like I heard
6363400	6369560	that people on the Nintendo tree house streams for completely non Pokemon games were like,
6369560	6373720	um, just complaining about no national Pokedex.
6374840	6380600	And so I think like, I mean, I personally feel like, um, there are so many Pokemon and
6380600	6385800	I definitely understand what other people, um, you know, I understand the other side
6385800	6388120	of the argument, but for me, there's so many Pokemon.
6388760	6395160	And what I always find is that like, you know, like I'm the type of person who typically
6396120	6402280	tries to build like one team that I, you know, maybe, maybe not like consistent from the
6402280	6406120	beginning because you know, that you catch them, you might maybe catch some later in
6406120	6411240	the game or whatever, but like, I kind of like try to look at, you know, like types
6411240	6416360	and like, you know, trying to aim for one team that I like, you know, bring up to the
6416360	6418440	elite four and the Pokemon league or whatever.
6419000	6425640	Um, so I mean, I already feel like there are so many Pokemon that I don't really get a
6425640	6433160	chance to, um, you know, uh, have a, have a chance to play with or, you know, really,
6434920	6435960	um, experience.
6435960	6441960	So, I mean, adding a bunch of old Pokemon in there is only going to, you know, kind
6441960	6447880	of increase the temptation like, Oh, well I want a, you know, such and such, um,
6447880	6451800	I want a Pikachu and a Jigglypuff because those are the things I'm familiar with.
6451800	6452300	Right.
6453720	6453880	Right.
6453880	6458520	Or like you said, you might have a favorite and, you know, you want your favorite or you're
6458520	6461880	like, Oh, you know, this one has a really unique type and, you know, I want to build
6461880	6462600	my team around that.
6462600	6463400	So, I mean, I don't know.
6463400	6469240	I think it's going to, I hope that it's going to encourage people to, you know, give the
6469240	6470360	new Pokemon a chance.
6471000	6476600	What I will say though, is I really feel like, and I mean, I don't know if this is like,
6476600	6483160	you know, pointless or, you know, worthless at this point, but, um, you know, I think
6483160	6487160	back to the Pokemon stadium games and I guess the reason, you know, the reason why they
6487160	6491960	originally existed was because, you know, the original games were on Game Boy and they
6491960	6495960	were, you know, pixels and it was like your way to see your Pokemon in 3d and everything,
6496040	6501960	but this might not be a bad time to start looking at bringing back if this is going
6501960	6505640	to be kind of their method moving forward, which they said it is.
6506760	6506920	Yeah.
6506920	6513400	So if that's really remains true, it might not be a bad idea to have some sort of like
6513400	6515800	cross-platform mobile.
6515800	6521560	And cause then that way the people on Pokemon go could still participate, have like a mobile
6522280	6526360	and, um, switch cross-platform thing.
6526360	6528120	That's kind of like a Pokemon stadium.
6528120	6533080	And it could have like a little Pokemon farm or whatever that, um, one game was like a
6533080	6537480	Pokemon show off space, like a Pokemon show off Pokemon ranch or something that you could
6537480	6538200	show everything off.
6538200	6544200	So you can like play with your Pokemon and you can, um, battle with them like in a separate,
6545000	6546680	you know, situation.
6546680	6549320	And then that way they could, you know, just continually update it.
6550280	6553080	Shane, Shane, did you want to follow up on that before I go to another question?
6553800	6557160	Well, yeah, that's kind of what Pokemon home is supposed to be for.
6557160	6559480	They've stated it's where they're supposed to live.
6559480	6565800	Now, the problem with that is people I'm saying people being a little general here, a lot
6565800	6571160	of players from what I've read and I take the same stance.
6571160	6577720	It feels like it's more just like a holding area at this point, no matter what they do
6577720	6584440	for Pokemon home, it's they're charging you to keep your Pokemon there until you can bring
6584440	6587560	them in, which who knows what generation at this point you'll get to do that.
6587560	6592360	And that seems like a really, really bad decision.
6592360	6592680	Okay.
6592680	6597080	So my personal take on this whole thing, like, you know, I'm more of a casual Pokemon fan,
6597080	6597720	obviously.
6597720	6602840	And, um, there's a part of me that's kind of like, you know, it does, when you do say
6602840	6606680	gotta catch them all, it is a little weird to be saying we're going to release this game
6606680	6608680	and you really can't catch them all.
6608680	6612520	You know, and I got to admit, there's, there's, I mean, I think at the end of the day, let's
6612520	6613800	not, I'm not going to kid myself.
6613800	6615160	I'm still going to buy the game.
6615160	6619320	And I honestly think a lot of people out there that are upset will probably end up buying
6619320	6619800	the game anyway.
6619800	6622840	Not that I'm trying to invalidate the way anybody feels or anything like that, especially
6622840	6626440	with like some of the compelling stories you told Shane, like that completely makes sense.
6626440	6631720	But I do feel like when it comes down to the money, like it's not really going to change.
6631720	6635800	But I do have to admit, I get a little side eye with Game Freak because I even feel like
6635800	6640040	when they introduce Pokemon bank, they kind of set the stage as, oh, well, this is the
6640040	6644040	way you're going to store all your Pokemon in the future and be able to take your Pokemon
6644040	6649240	into future games and kind of gave that impression that like, you know, well, and then they put
6649240	6651000	Pokemon home out on top of Pokemon bank.
6651720	6651960	Yeah.
6651960	6657080	Well, and just to quickly interject, literally two weeks before this information happened,
6657080	6661880	they had that big presentation where they were saying how important or how they know
6661880	6667320	how important these Pokemon that we've raised since their first games they like they appeared
6667320	6668440	in are to us.
6668440	6674280	And that's what Pokemon home was supposed to to accomplish was being the new Pokemon
6674280	6679560	bank so we can bring our friends over into the new games.
6679560	6683400	And it seems to fly right in the face of that what they have chosen.
6684200	6687400	Let me ask one more question and then for time, I got to go ahead and wrap up here.
6687400	6689560	But and I'll start with John on this question.
6689640	6694600	But I think there's probably like a cynical part of me, especially looking at a lot of
6694600	6699320	E3 releases this year that kind of goes, for example, the Final Fantasy 7 remake.
6699320	6701640	Okay, Episode One is coming out on PlayStation 4.
6701640	6704680	But then what comes out the very next year, the PlayStation 5.
6704680	6708360	So they're going to get you to buy the Final Fantasy remake Episode One all over again
6708360	6711480	in preparation for Episode Two, which will probably be on the PlayStation 5.
6711480	6715960	How I'm tying that to Pokemon is that this is the way that they say that Pokemon Sword
6715960	6717240	and Shield is going to be.
6717240	6720760	But I think inevitably there will be a Pokemon gun, right?
6720760	6723320	Or we're all joking, calling it a Pokemon gun.
6723320	6728600	But there will be some sort of the equivalent of yellow, the equivalent of the best of or
6728600	6729240	whatever.
6729240	6734760	And perhaps that will be the game that you can bring all your Pokemon into.
6734760	6738840	Is that how you kind of forecast this going, John?
6738840	6742280	Or do you think that nope, this is going to just stay this way?
6742280	6744440	Yeah, it's definitely possible.
6746520	6751240	Like, I mean, I feel like they've got some thing in the works, like, whether it's that
6751240	6759800	or, you know, some sort of, like I said, a colosseum sort of thing that can really connect
6759800	6761720	with Pokemon home.
6762280	6768040	Like, I feel like there's going to be some sort of experience that like, I mean, I don't
6768040	6773000	know, maybe it's just maybe you can bring all your Pokemon into Pokemon sleep and sleep
6773000	6774920	with sleep with all your favorite Pokemon.
6774920	6778360	No, I do think that's an interesting idea that's kind of come up from this discussion
6778360	6783160	that I didn't think of before is that perhaps there will be some other type of Pokemon game
6783160	6787000	where the main point of that game is to showcase your existing Pokemon.
6787880	6790440	Quickly, and then we'll wrap up, Shane, the same question.
6790440	6793960	Do you think this gets resolved in a Pokemon gun type of situation?
6795000	6797480	I think they're too stubborn to do that.
6797480	6802600	Another quick thing to point out is this game is also removing Megas and Z crystals.
6803160	6809000	So that all those mechanics where you get new versions of Pokemon too, or awesome moves
6809000	6810680	kind of those are gone too.
6810680	6817640	And I feel like they, especially because the Japanese players via social media at least
6817640	6823480	have now accepted the fact that they're not getting the old Pokemon because of what in
6823480	6825000	interviews Game Freak has said.
6825640	6828040	I think there, I think this is it.
6828040	6831160	I think this is how it's going to be from now on, and they're not going to come back
6831160	6831720	from it.
6831800	6835400	I would hope for it differently, but I think they're done.
6835400	6838120	This is their new direction and they're sticking to it.
6838680	6839320	Okay.
6839320	6840040	Well, fair enough.
6840040	6842920	Well, they're waving goodbye in the direct, which means I'm running out of footage and
6842920	6844520	I got to start it over here pretty soon.
6844520	6849800	But while I do that, I want to wrap up here and head back to the studio live.
6849800	6852040	I want to thank you both for joining me tonight for this side discussion.
6852040	6856680	It was really cool and nice to talk about Pokemon with some Pokemon fans, but quickly
6856680	6858680	before we head out, do you guys have anything you want to plug?
6859240	6861720	Shane, I know you're not really hosting any shows right now.
6861720	6863640	Is there anything you want to plug before we head out?
6864600	6866280	Um, no.
6866840	6867080	Okay.
6867080	6868440	Well, thanks for being here nonetheless.
6869160	6873400	Jon, I know you have a show because I've been listening to like the, what, like three episodes
6873400	6874360	you just put out this week.
6874360	6875720	So tell us a little bit about that, Jon.
6876360	6876600	Yeah.
6876600	6881080	We're gamebuoy.org, your port of call for gaming news and videos that maybe you don't
6881080	6882760	turn your radar, but most definitely should be.
6882760	6886680	We just did almost daily episodes about E3.
6886680	6890520	So, you know, definitely, um, lots of news out there to digest.
6890520	6895160	And we actually haven't even talked about Pokemon just because there's been so much
6895880	6897240	in the gaming world.
6897240	6899640	You guys are going to need a whole episode.
6899640	6901960	You're going to need a whole episode for it anyway.
6901960	6902440	All right.
6902440	6904680	Thank you guys both for joining me tonight.
6904680	6909720	Let's go back to the studio live for the continuation of Orange Lounge Radio tonight.
6911640	6911960	All right.
6911960	6915080	That was a fun little, uh, different type of break segment there.
6915080	6917880	And Shane told me kind of like after we, we stopped recording and he's like, I could
6917880	6921320	have gone on for another 30 minutes about, and I'm like, I bet I wouldn't stop there.
6921320	6922440	It's too long of a break.
6922440	6926520	If only we hadn't had a podcast at one point that was all about Pokemon.
6926520	6929000	But anyway, did you also catch what I did in that video?
6929000	6931320	By the way, I did like the number one thing you're not supposed to do.
6931320	6933960	I wore my green shirt with my green screen today.
6935400	6942360	Um, I didn't notice it then, but I did notice that the sheen from your light during your
6942360	6946040	Square Enix thing was causing parts of your face to like come out.
6946040	6949880	Well, part of the, I'm going to, I'm not going to throw Bobby under the bus for that completely,
6949880	6952040	but actually he was controlling the green screen on his end.
6952040	6956920	It wasn't my process against his, but, um, I think because the quality dips a little
6956920	6959240	bit because he's pulling a Skype image.
6959240	6963720	I think it just causes, yeah, it makes, it makes it, uh, wreak a little more havoc on
6963720	6965880	it, but we're learning, we're playing fine.
6965880	6966600	It was fine.
6966600	6967320	It's fine.
6967320	6968280	Mistakes are going to happen.
6968280	6969240	It's, it's all good.
6969240	6972360	So anyway, um, yeah.
6972360	6973880	So what do you, what do you think on all that?
6973880	6975960	You're just not, you're just not as big into Pokemon, right?
6975960	6978920	I just don't really care too much that not all the Pokemon are in there.
6978920	6981560	Cause I mean, you weren't going to catch them all anyway.
6982200	6982840	No.
6982840	6983160	All right.
6985000	6987160	No, I mean, I, I haven't even finished.
6987160	6987800	Let's go.
6987800	6991800	Like, especially when they want you to do all the like challenges now where you have
6991800	6993880	to become the master of all the different Pokemon.
6993880	6995720	I'm like, no, no, I don't.
6995720	6996600	I'm done.
6996600	6997880	I need to check on the cat.
6997880	6999800	Why don't we start some rapid fire news here?
7001080	7006120	He's, he's trying to tear a hole through space and time or at least a box.
7006120	7006620	Who knows?
7007160	7010040	Anyways, let's talk a little bit about star control.
7010040	7013000	So star control and star control origins.
7013560	7016280	There was a lawsuit between those developers.
7016280	7021480	And of course now they have decided that they are settling that lawsuit.
7021480	7022040	Okay.
7022040	7023160	This mush update is more important.
7023160	7024280	Do you know what it is?
7024280	7024680	No.
7024680	7027000	Do you know how he moved the litter box to a covered litter box?
7027000	7028600	He's using the litter box right now.
7028600	7030600	We don't usually have that during OLR.
7030600	7032120	So what we had to do, so Mr.
7032120	7037240	Smoosh really loves to dig in the litter box a lot.
7037240	7042280	And so he had a litter box that was in the bathroom, but he would kick the litter outside
7042280	7042760	the box.
7043320	7045640	So his dad's got sick of that.
7045640	7049000	So they got him a covered litter box, but it won't fit in the bathroom.
7049000	7050600	So we had to move it out here into it.
7050600	7053000	So it's right on the, I guess you guys can't see it on Twitch.
7053000	7054440	It's right on the other side of the wall.
7054440	7057480	So when I heard the scratching, I was like, oh, he's, he's using the scratch post out
7057480	7057560	there.
7057560	7060920	And I'm like, what kind of ungodly noise is that?
7060920	7061960	It's litter box.
7061960	7063160	It does sound a little bit.
7063160	7063320	Yeah.
7063320	7066840	Cause my cat does the same thing, you know, it makes a lot more sense for she's in the
7066840	7067240	garage.
7067240	7067880	It's not a surprise.
7067880	7070680	It's not getting picked up by the mics, but yeah, I started walking over there and looked
7070680	7074520	over here and it's one of those litter boxes that he actually has to go inside.
7074520	7076360	Cause like the, the roof has like a little cut out.
7076360	7078440	And so I looked at, he's like peeking at me from up there.
7078440	7080280	I'm like, oh, oh, sorry about that.
7080280	7081320	Sorry about that.
7081320	7082600	Didn't mean to walk in on you, Mr.
7082600	7082920	Smoosh.
7083720	7090200	Anyway, so yes, they've settled, they have settled and apparently are going to be supporting
7090200	7092360	each other's endeavors as well.
7092360	7094360	So, um, very cool.
7094920	7097000	I'm looking forward to more star control games.
7097000	7098840	I used to love a star control too.
7100360	7105880	And then, um, we've got some news regarding, uh, moral combat 11.
7105880	7114200	So they have a brand new update that is going to be, um, introducing new brutalities into
7114200	7115560	the game as well.
7115560	7125880	And also kind of, um, leading the way for some of the DLC, but yeah, so interesting
7125880	7132680	that they had, like, apparently there's, um, a brutality for, uh, Cabal in the game where
7132680	7134520	he scares the soul of the player.
7135160	7138360	Um, that's a throwback to the classic from three.
7138360	7139000	Yeah.
7139000	7142840	Uh, they have a ton of different patch notes in here, but if you want to check it out,
7142840	7149240	I'm sure they've got it on moral comments site, but yes, uh, lots of updates and, you
7149240	7150920	know, balancing and stuff like that.
7152040	7152920	So cool.
7152920	7157400	Not really a big moral combat fan, but I am a fan of spawn, so I'll have to check that
7157400	7159720	out when they have been playable and see what that's all about.
7160520	7162120	Don't think it'll get me to buy the game though.
7165240	7165720	All right.
7165720	7165960	Yeah.
7165960	7170120	I Alan's been playing a lot of mortal combat 11, but y'all know, I don't know.
7170120	7173320	I like sometimes I'll kind of watch over, but you know, he does some weird thing.
7173320	7177320	Maybe you guys know more about this than I do, but like he leaves it running.
7177320	7180280	Like, like let's say we go out for food or something.
7180280	7184120	He'll bring up moral combat 11 and he goes into the AI mode and he has the AI battle
7184120	7187320	each other and he leaves that running while we go out for food, because I guess it's generating
7187320	7189720	coins for the craft or something doing that.
7189720	7193560	I didn't know that was the thing you could do, but that's, I guess, I don't know if it's
7193560	7197240	an exploit or what you'd call that, but you think if it was unintended, they would have
7197240	7198760	patched it out of the game by now, I think.
7198760	7200360	But I thought that was kind of an interesting thing.
7200360	7202440	So, all right.
7204840	7207720	Let's move on and talk about some other quick stories.
7207720	7212520	So last week we had the Microsoft press conference and y'all know, I was very excited about fantasy
7212520	7214200	star online too.
7214200	7218440	And some people were a little bit like, I don't want to get an X-Box and my PC isn't
7218440	7220920	good enough to play fantasy star online too.
7220920	7221880	Am I just screwed?
7222040	7224920	And at the time it seemed like the answer was yes.
7224920	7231640	However, apparently X-Box boss Phil Spencer confirmed to giant bomb in an interview that
7231640	7236120	fantasy star online too, will end up on all platforms.
7237160	7241000	Doesn't say necessarily it'd be the exact same time, but that they do plan to put PSO
7241000	7242200	2 on all platforms.
7242200	7245480	Yeah, at least they, I don't know, at least he brought that up.
7245480	7246920	He didn't have to do that.
7246920	7247880	Yeah, no, he didn't have to.
7247880	7250920	And again, that's kind of one of those things where like Phil Spencer's a cool dad, you
7250920	7251240	know what I mean?
7251240	7252680	Which by the way, happy father's day, Loki.
7252680	7255480	I should, I forgot to say that at the top of the show, it was up here and then I totally
7255480	7256200	forgot to say anything.
7256200	7256840	We got derailed.
7256840	7258360	So happy father's day.
7258360	7260280	Thank you to you and Phil Spencer.
7260280	7261080	All right.
7261080	7265320	It was just like any other day full of screaming, whining children and then migraines.
7265320	7266760	They didn't do anything nice for you today?
7267800	7269960	If by giving me a migraine was nice, then no.
7269960	7270440	Okay.
7270440	7270760	I'm sorry.
7270760	7271480	That was fine.
7272120	7272520	Whatever.
7272520	7277400	I mean, my one son, he made me a little like dish thing.
7277400	7278600	I don't really know what it is, but.
7279000	7283880	Um, and then my other son, he made something for me, but he left it on the ground.
7283880	7288440	And so I assume that that's my gift because it said happy father's day on it, but that's
7288440	7288840	fine.
7288840	7289720	I don't care.
7289720	7292040	I mean, whatever.
7292040	7298840	I, I just wish we had one day where they would just behave for like even a little bit, just,
7298840	7304520	just for like, not until they're not like 10 minutes, you know, that would be just nice.
7304520	7306920	But no, not this week.
7306920	7307800	Not until they're 18.
7308360	7308840	Anyway.
7308840	7311480	Um, so why did they end up doing this?
7311480	7315000	Uh, apparently Phil Spencer said simply, I wanted to do something with Sega.
7315000	7320200	And, uh, this kind of helped, but they are indicating it could be a timed exclusive.
7320200	7323400	So even though probably online too, we'll be coming to the other systems.
7323400	7324840	It probably won't be right away.
7324840	7327560	So it does seem like there is at least a timed exclusive agreement with that.
7327560	7332200	So something to keep in mind, but, and as DJ Rama S is reminding me in chat, and I thought
7332200	7333640	I mentioned it, but I'll mention it again.
7333640	7336280	Uh, windows PC will also be an option to you.
7336280	7338440	So if you do have a PC, that's good enough to play it.
7338440	7342200	You don't necessarily have to run out and buy an X-Box just to just part of games pass.
7342920	7344520	Um, well, it's going to be free to play.
7344520	7345560	So, yeah.
7345560	7349640	So it's just depends on how much of the, you know, in game stuff you want to pick up.
7350200	7355080	Um, so one thing that was absent from E3, at least in the official press conference
7355080	7358120	capacity and the direct was the Nintendo 3DS.
7358760	7361720	It was, yeah, I have to admit, I kind of had a similar reaction.
7361720	7363960	Look, don't misinterpret me.
7363960	7365240	I love the 3DS.
7365240	7366440	It's a great system.
7366440	7367560	It's just time to move on.
7367560	7371000	It's just time to move on to the Nintendo switch, which is a great portable system.
7371000	7373400	But Nintendo does want to emphasize.
7373400	7375160	The 3DS is not dead.
7375160	7378920	Doug Bowser, the new president, which we, I think very clearly saw in that direct.
7378920	7381640	We didn't talk about a little joke at the beginning, but it was silly.
7381640	7384280	It was, where would you, Doug Bowser did a good job, right?
7384280	7384680	I think he did fine.
7384680	7385880	He's got some big shoes to fill.
7385880	7386920	I think he did a fine job.
7386920	7388520	It's hard to fill Reggie's shoes.
7388520	7388840	It is.
7388840	7392200	It's a very hard job, but I love, I like that they use the humor a little bit to kind of,
7392200	7393880	you know, show that he's got a sense of humor.
7393960	7396520	It's not just going to be some dry CEO taking over.
7396520	7398760	I think it's a good thing, or excuse me, president taking over.
7399480	7404840	Anyway, Doug Bowser did mention that the 3DS still has plenty of support from consumers
7404840	7405640	in retail.
7405640	7410200	So even though he said at this point, we have no games to announce on the 3DS at E3.
7410200	7414680	In fact, we're not really showing 3DS content here because it's all about the Nintendo switch,
7414680	7417880	but our 3DS business continues to do quite well.
7417880	7420760	Retailers continue to support both the hardware and the software.
7420760	7425240	And as long as there's consumer demand for 3DS, we'll continue to support it.
7425240	7429720	In fact, we belay believe it's a great entry point for young gamers.
7430360	7434760	So I imagine the 3DS will continue to be a third party supported.
7434760	7435960	Like, I don't know.
7435960	7439880	What's the modern equivalent of Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen go shopping and those types
7439880	7440380	of games.
7440920	7445320	Barbie, let's ride horse creator, pretty, you know, those types of things that are more
7445320	7446120	geared to kids.
7446120	7447480	What are like the modern equivalent of that?
7447480	7449960	The modern equivalent of that, just like movie tie-in games.
7450040	7453960	They've got one for like weird dolls or some odd dolls, or I don't know what the movie
7453960	7455000	is adventure time.
7455000	7456680	I would say adventure time games.
7456680	7459320	But I'm like, I know of a lot of adults who get high adventure times.
7459320	7461960	Not bad, but yeah.
7461960	7465160	So things that, you know, are a little more aimed at kids, Nickelodeon games, I guess
7465160	7468680	we'll leave it at that Nickelodeon games, you know, and that type of thing.
7468680	7472760	So it seems like there might still be, but Nintendo themselves doesn't seem like they're
7472760	7474760	looking to do anything official on the 3DS right now.
7474760	7478440	So you will just have to play one of the hundreds of games that already exist for the 3DS.
7478440	7480360	If you're looking for something like that.
7480360	7482040	So, all right.
7482040	7486760	Anyhow, a mistake theory in our chat at twitch.tv slash vog network says, Barbie, let's ride
7486760	7489800	horse creator 3D remastered this fall on the PS4.
7491000	7495400	Man, that was the one Xbox game I was hoping to see on Xbox one.
7496280	7496680	Anyway.
7499800	7502760	Dark Tetsuya says apparently one of the SpongeBob games is getting a remaster.
7502760	7503480	Who would have thought?
7503480	7503800	Yeah.
7503800	7504200	Who would have?
7504200	7505400	Battle for Bikini Bottom.
7505400	7506120	Yeah.
7506120	7506920	Okay.
7506920	7507560	All right.
7507560	7508200	Let's move on.
7508200	7511000	Let's travel around the world and check out some games that are going to be releasing
7511000	7512760	a little sooner than a SpongeBob remaster.
7512760	7517240	As we check out world release date starting in the U S blaster master zero on PC this
7517240	7517800	week.
7517800	7518200	Cool.
7518200	7520920	And I can't believe it, but we're at this point.
7520920	7526840	Finally, bloodstain ritual of the night coming out on PC PlayStation for Xbox one.
7528200	7530920	Not the switch because that's next week or the week after.
7530920	7535640	Supposedly I'm getting a copy of that, but like I filled out that backer survey like
7535720	7536920	three years ago.
7536920	7539160	And I guess I'm still getting it.
7539160	7541640	Like I don't, I don't think I get a physical copy.
7541640	7542920	I think I get a digital copy.
7542920	7545960	I feel like it was on PS4, but I moved it to the switch.
7545960	7547000	I feel like that was the thing I did.
7547000	7551640	Like, I don't even know you guys, this game I gave money to like six years ago.
7551640	7555720	I finally get my, my, uh, my payback on that, I guess.
7555720	7558360	But I might have to wait one more week if I did ask for the switch version.
7558360	7558840	Yeah.
7558840	7564920	There's a game called, uh, 19, eight X that's on PC and PlayStation four.
7564920	7572120	My friend Pedro on the PC and switch, uh, super niche, Neptunia RPG on PC and Yakuza
7572120	7574760	five on PlayStation four.
7574760	7576680	And then actually I'm just checking real quick.
7576680	7577880	See, this is part of the week.
7577880	7578040	Yep.
7578040	7579400	Apparently this is still part of the week.
7579400	7585080	So we've got crash team racing nitro field on Nintendo switch PlayStation four and Xbox
7585080	7585640	one.
7585640	7586600	That's it.
7586600	7587320	All right.
7587320	7591480	Traveling over to Japan and checking out some of the releases on the PlayStation four to
7591480	7591880	start.
7591880	7599560	We have on June 20th from Sega Ryu Ga Gotoku five Yume Kanaishi mono remaster is coming
7599560	7600200	out this week.
7600200	7601400	That is a Sega game.
7601400	7602360	Yakuza five.
7602360	7604040	Is that, Oh, that's what is Yakuza five.
7604040	7606040	Uh, yeah, of course, of course you just five.
7606040	7610280	Uh, and then ease eight, uh, Lacrimosa of Dana is getting a price reduction.
7610280	7612120	I was like, I thought that ease game was already out.
7612120	7612280	Yeah.
7612280	7614360	So that's just a price reduction that we get in Japan.
7614360	7618120	Dead by daylight survivor edition, uh, gets a release in Japan.
7618120	7619720	I think they probably already had dead by daylight.
7619720	7621560	This is probably like a DLC type thing.
7621560	7626040	And then, um, some new peripherals, like a new headset and things of that sort.
7626040	7630120	So that's what you get on the PlayStation four on the Nintendo switch this week, a game
7630120	7631640	called summer pockets.
7631640	7633560	Oh, and this must be the big release this week.
7633560	7635320	Yo-kai watch four.
7635320	7637800	We're looking up at the same sky.
7637800	7639960	I should point out that as a switch release.
7639960	7643720	So speaking of the three DS kind of moving on from that, those Yo-kai watch games were
7643720	7645320	all in the three DS previously.
7645320	7647640	So this will be the first one that's on the switch.
7647640	7652120	And I imagine, um, some people very much looking forward to that one kind of surprised
7652120	7654920	that didn't make its way to a Nintendo direct here.
7654920	7656760	Did those games just kind of flop here?
7656760	7658760	I thought the first one at least did pretty well.
7658760	7659320	I don't know.
7659320	7659800	Huh?
7659800	7661720	I wonder if they're still going to translate that here.
7661720	7662520	I would think so.
7662520	7666360	Especially, especially with the fact that the switch is doing pretty well, you would
7666360	7668360	think so, but, uh, I guess we'll see.
7668920	7669320	All right.
7669960	7675000	Anyway, um, mistake theory and chat says the Yo-kai watch switch game looks beautiful.
7675000	7677960	It puts the new Pokemon to shame visually at least.
7677960	7681160	And Akuma JP is letting out a yes in the chat room.
7681160	7683640	I know those, those games are much bigger in Japan than they are here.
7683640	7685240	They tried to make it a thing here.
7685240	7688840	Um, and I think that you would actually see the physical toys at Toys R Us.
7688840	7693800	And they, you know, giving you an indication of how far back we got to go and Toys R Us
7693800	7697080	was still around, but, um, you know, and that's more than I can say to most video games.
7697080	7700600	So I think, you know, I think they hit a pretty good kid market with that, with that stuff.
7700600	7704680	So anyway, um, how about Europe with dark Sakura having left the building?
7704920	7706200	Loki, can you cover Europe?
7706200	7706520	Yeah.
7706520	7710200	So I mentioned this last week, but I guess it's been delayed a couple of days, but Leisure
7710200	7711800	Suit Larry wet dreams don't dry.
7711800	7716200	That's coming out on PlayStation four and Nintendo switch, uh, the Sims four Island
7716200	7718120	living out on PC.
7718120	7721720	That expansion there, uh, ever space stellar edition.
7721720	7724680	That's coming out on PlayStation four.
7724680	7730040	We've got a double pack of far cry five and far cry four that's on PlayStation four and
7730040	7734040	Xbox one bloodstain ritual of the night coming out over there as well.
7734040	7740360	PlayStation four, Xbox one and the switch, uh, Nippon marathon on PlayStation four and
7740360	7749160	the switch, uh, Valfyria arc hero school story on Nintendo switch Rico on PlayStation four
7749160	7754600	and Nintendo switch, uh, and crash team racing nitro fueled out on PlayStation four, Xbox
7754600	7755640	one and Nintendo switch.
7756440	7760600	Uh, pixel pockets in our chat says I hate the name of the newest Leisure Suit Larry
7760600	7761240	so much.
7762120	7764920	Well, yeah, they're, they're all pretty gross to be fair.
7764920	7770760	It's, I guess kind of the point, but I, I kind of hear that name and I go, uh, okay.
7770760	7773240	I make that same universal sound of disgust.
7773240	7775240	Uh, anyway.
7776120	7776840	All right.
7776840	7778760	Uh, let's get to the mailbag, shall we?
7778760	7783400	Uh, every week we invite you guys to email us, participate at orange lounge radio.com.
7783400	7785560	And we read some of these emails here on the show.
7786120	7788520	Uh, first email tonight from Garth Wolf.
7788520	7789720	Hello, O L R.
7789720	7794120	So I have to know has Julian, uh, which you guys don't know.
7794120	7797000	Um, that is, uh, dark soccer is BFF Becky.
7797000	7801480	Her kid is Julian and not the, not the animal crossing care we referenced earlier.
7801480	7801980	Yes.
7802040	7803240	Uh, different one.
7803240	7806840	Um, but he's gotta be like 12 now, 13 almost.
7806840	7807160	I don't know.
7807160	7808120	He's, he's getting older.
7808120	7812360	So anyway, uh, the question is, has Julian heard Carly Rae Jepsen's new album?
7812360	7814760	Is he absolutely living for track one?
7815480	7817320	Let me translate to heterosexual.
7817320	7817820	Okay.
7819240	7823160	Track one on Carly Rae Jepsen's new album is called Julian.
7823160	7825160	And it's a bop as the kids would say.
7825160	7826920	So it's a, it's a fun little song.
7826920	7829560	So the question is, has Julian heard the song Julian?
7829560	7830440	We don't know.
7830440	7833800	Um, but we will pass that question along to Becky and get back to you.
7833800	7838120	But now I want to know, since we brought up earlier in the show that there is an animal
7838120	7840040	crossing character named Julian.
7840040	7843240	What I want to know is, does Julian know about Julian and animal crossing?
7843240	7847320	And do they listen to Julian by Carly Rae Jepsen while they play animal crossing?
7847320	7849480	We'll ask these hard hitting questions and get back to you.
7850120	7851640	All right, moving on.
7853000	7856120	One more email here from Frodo Swagons.
7857000	7861480	Again, and if you want to email us for a future week, participate at orangeloungeradio.com.
7861480	7863560	Hey, OLR Frodo Swagons here.
7863560	7867000	So I've really been having an itch to play at MMO lately.
7867000	7869720	I was thinking about getting into Elder Scrolls online.
7869720	7872440	I was doing some research and I guess with all the expansions,
7872440	7874440	some are saying that the game is in its prime.
7874440	7876040	I played the heck out of Skyrim.
7876040	7877720	So I think this might be up my alley.
7877720	7879880	Do any of you have any experience with ESO?
7880520	7884920	Also beyond ESO, are there any MMOs you could recommend me trying out?
7884920	7887480	And that is again from Frodo Swagons.
7887480	7889240	I have played a little bit of ESO.
7889240	7892280	I will admit my experience when I played it was not great,
7892280	7895160	but I think it's because I played it the week that it went.
7895160	7899240	It's not free to play, but it lost the subscription fee on PlayStation four.
7899240	7901000	It went for like the Guild Wars model.
7901000	7901240	Yeah.
7901240	7903800	Once you buy the game, then you pretty much like own it.
7903800	7907000	I only played it in beta and I just, I was expecting Skyrim.
7907000	7907800	I didn't get Skyrim.
7907800	7908760	So I was like, meh.
7908760	7909960	So I think that's important to know.
7909960	7911480	ESO is not Skyrim.
7911480	7917720	But that being said, the people that are into it that I know really seem to be into it.
7917720	7921480	So it's worth checking out if you like Skyrim.
7921480	7926120	There is no monthly fee, which, you know, obviously the big MMO players right now,
7926120	7929720	World of Warcraft and Final Fantasy 14, they do have monthly fees.
7929720	7933400	But otherwise there's a lot out there that's either buy once
7933400	7935000	or just straight up free to play.
7935000	7935480	Right.
7935480	7936520	Guild Wars 2.
7936520	7938040	Guild Wars 2 is a buy once.
7938040	7940520	Star Trek Online is free to play.
7940520	7943400	I don't know if you're, I don't know, like what your tastes are completely.
7943400	7945880	I mean, you like Skyrim, but if sci-fi is up your alley,
7945880	7948520	I played Star Trek Online for a hot minute and I thought it was pretty fun.
7948520	7949640	And that was way back in the beginning.
7949640	7952760	I kind of want to, you know, so many games, so little time, right?
7952760	7953320	Yeah.
7953320	7953640	Yeah.
7953640	7956360	Same DC Universe was another one like that.
7956360	7957480	That played like going.
7957480	7959240	I think so that played like a beat them up.
7959240	7960920	And that, uh, that was, that was fun.
7961480	7966520	Um, I, you know, my answer, I'm going to encourage you to check out Final Fantasy 14.
7966520	7968200	I think it's great, but it does have a month.
7968200	7970760	World of Warcraft has like the starter thing, doesn't it?
7970760	7971000	Yeah.
7971000	7974120	You know, and, uh, both those games do have a starter edition.
7974120	7975880	So I think that's worth checking out.
7975880	7978520	Uh, if you want to, you can just roll free to play.
7978520	7981000	You can level a character up to like 35.
7981000	7986280	You're limited on like how much gold you can have and who you can send tells to and stuff
7986280	7991560	because they don't want gold spammers, just roll, rolling unlimited free accounts.
7991560	7993080	That's why there's so many restrictions.
7993080	7997240	It's not just to like convince you to buy the game, but they, they have to be careful
7997240	8000760	about some of those gold spammers and things like that being, uh, have easy access to make
8000760	8001320	a new account.
8001320	8004920	So, but I would definitely say download the trial edition of Final Fantasy 14.
8004920	8008760	It's available on PlayStation 4 as well as PC or World of Warcraft.
8008760	8011720	If you want, if you want to try the behemoth granddaddy of them all.
8012360	8014120	World of Warcraft does have a starter edition.
8014120	8015080	You can check out as well.
8015720	8018040	And right here at the boys geeks network, you know, girls gone.
8018040	8018360	Wow.
8018360	8022440	Is still going strong and they're still into the game and they talk about it still every
8022440	8023080	week rating.
8023080	8026760	I know they're still rating and doing progression because I know they've been jumping into that
8026760	8028440	classic edition or whatever it is.
8028440	8029080	Vanilla.
8029080	8032760	I don't know if they've done, I feel like they did do like an episode on it, but until
8032760	8035880	that's here, I don't know if it's not out yet.
8036680	8039720	Um, but that's also not something I'm anticipating is going to be free to play.
8039720	8042120	So it's a little bit outside with this question about, yeah.
8042120	8044760	But, um, that will be a thing at some point as well.
8044760	8047640	So, um, other comments in chat.
8047640	8050840	So quest buster, our chatters want to have their say as well.
8050840	8053800	Um, actually, let me start with this comment because you just says, if you want to play
8053800	8055400	an MMO, just play Minecraft.
8055400	8058440	MMOs are a waste of money, but some of my memos are free to play.
8058440	8060040	So you can't really say they're a waste of money.
8060040	8064840	Like some, you know, just go into, um, something like steam and just look up free to play.
8064840	8069160	And there's a lot of MMOs in there, uh, especially a lot of the stuff that comes over from Korea.
8069240	8075320	Um, what's the one, sorry, Apple watch.
8075320	8076040	Can't answer that.
8076040	8076360	Wow.
8076360	8080120	My Apple watch is like suddenly turned on Skynet has possessed my watch.
8080120	8081160	Um, anyway, what's that?
8081160	8086520	What's that one in Korea that, um, the guys, it has an affiliation with DJ max and has
8086520	8088120	that song, but I don't know.
8088120	8088840	Sword art.
8088840	8089400	Is that it?
8089400	8089720	I don't know.
8089720	8090600	Anyway.
8090600	8092440	Um, Oh, path of exile.
8092440	8093560	Pixel pockets calls out.
8093560	8094600	That's not really an MMO.
8094600	8097240	It's more like a Diablo game, but it's free and it's on all the consoles.
8097240	8098280	That's for sure.
8098280	8101400	Um, let's see Questbuster does warn careful with the Korean stuff.
8101400	8104040	A lot of the big Korean MMOs are massive grind fests.
8104040	8104920	Uh, bless.
8104920	8105800	That was the name of it.
8105800	8106920	Thank you, Shane.
8106920	8112680	Um, Questbuster also says ESO just released a new expansion to called elsewhere.
8112680	8113720	I hope I said that right.
8113720	8116920	Homeland of the Khajiit and introduces a new necromancer class.
8116920	8118360	I've also heard the same as Rob.
8118360	8119800	People that are playing it seem to like it.
8119800	8124920	And if it's come a long way since this rough beta days, uh, and then also brings up the
8124920	8125880	Diablo light games.
8125880	8128120	Questbuster says there's also warframe.
8128120	8133000	If you want something more sci-fi, uh, dark Tetsuya says I should bring up the final fantasy
8133000	8135240	14 vanilla thing that was on Twitter.
8135240	8139160	I wish I had the video ready to go, but I retweeted it on my personal account at Rob
8139160	8139880	Roberts.
8139880	8145080	So somebody in an E3 interview or something asked the question of Yoshi P that it didn't
8145080	8150040	say because of world of Warcraft of vanilla, but basically was saying since it's been so
8150040	8154840	many years, since 1.0, have you ever thought about releasing 1.0 and a version of that
8154840	8159240	that people can experience and Yoshi P, he understands enough English where he just starts
8159240	8161800	busting up laughing as the question is being asked.
8161800	8165640	And then, um, so the translator starts to go and say the thing.
8165640	8170280	And then the translator hands the mic over and he just looks at it and he goes nightmare.
8174840	8177800	And then everybody laughs because it's true nightmare.
8177800	8182360	And, uh, one thing that's also born world of Warcraft vanilla was kind of good for its
8182360	8183080	time.
8183080	8191720	Final fantasy 4T 1.0, although I guess towards the end of its run, it had some, it had some,
8191720	8193880	some inklings of the game that was to come.
8193880	8197960	And I think people remember it a little more fondly in its final form, but honestly, guys,
8197960	8201320	let them use the resources to keep reinventing the game.
8201320	8203240	I think shadowbringers is going to be a lot of fun.
8203240	8206200	I'm really looking forward to still holding out for my 11 remaster.
8206200	8206700	Yeah.
8207640	8208140	Right.
8208520	8209480	Someday.
8209480	8210120	All right.
8210120	8214760	Um, Frodo swaggins says, I noticed you just met some Skynet.
8214760	8218200	I don't know much about it besides they just launched a bunch of satellites and it's supposed
8218200	8219960	to give people internet worldwide.
8219960	8222280	Do you think that will have an impact on the gaming industry?
8222280	8225640	Well, the reason why I say Skynet is watch a movie called Terminator 2.
8225640	8229000	And it looks like, I'll explain why I said that right kids today.
8230760	8233560	Think of, do you know what year Terminator 2 came out?
8233560	8235160	It was a long time ago, Loki.
8235160	8235800	It's very possible.
8235800	8238600	There's been several Terminator movies that have come out since then.
8238600	8240840	They have covered Skynet within the last like 10 years.
8240840	8242280	Are they worth watching Loki?
8243560	8244520	That's what I thought.
8244520	8245020	All right.
8245960	8248760	The new one is, I mean, I don't know.
8251240	8254840	But to take the other part of the question seriously, do you think that'll have an impact
8254840	8255800	on the gaming industry?
8255800	8256120	Sure.
8256120	8260920	If people have internet worldwide, then things like Stadia, you can take a lot more seriously
8260920	8262840	as really being able to impact the industry.
8262840	8265960	And I think the more accessible the internet becomes, I think that's just going to be a
8265960	8270680	better thing just in general for being able to communicate and learn from cultures and
8270680	8271400	learn from other people.
8271400	8272840	I think that's just going to be a good thing.
8272840	8276040	And gaming is just one part of that.
8276040	8279160	And Bobby does say, you're thinking of Starlink and not Skynet.
8279160	8280840	Skynet is a movie reference.
8280840	8281340	You know what?
8282120	8284520	I get stuff mixed up all the time.
8284520	8286520	And Starlink, we're just having fun.
8286520	8290920	And Starlink is a failed toys to life game that had Starfox in it.
8290920	8291420	All right.
8291960	8293800	Anyway, that was it for our emails tonight.
8293800	8298600	Participate at OrangeLoungeTrady.com is the place to send us emails if you have something
8298600	8300520	you'd like to ask about in the future.
8301080	8304760	We do have a few more stories, things that happened this week that don't necessarily
8304760	8306520	relate to the press conferences.
8306520	8312200	In fact, one story that they would probably rather that wasn't reported on this week,
8312200	8313000	right, Loki?
8313000	8313500	Yes.
8314120	8318760	So there's been layoffs or potential layoffs with Amazon Game Studios.
8318760	8324920	So apparently they are going to be shifting some of the employees or trying to shift some
8324920	8326920	of the employees to other positions.
8326920	8331240	But if those employees don't find other positions, they're just going to be let go.
8331800	8336520	So Amazon Game Studios, they're reorganizing some of the teams to allow us to prioritize
8336520	8342040	development of New World and Crucible and new unannounced projects we're excited to
8342040	8343160	reveal in the future.
8343880	8349160	These moves are a result of regular business planning cycles where we align resources to
8349160	8351560	match evolving long range priorities.
8351560	8355640	We are working closely with the employees affected by these changes to assist in finding
8355640	8357160	new roles within Amazon.
8357160	8363640	Amazon is deeply committed to the games and continues to invest heavily in Amazon Game
8363640	8370680	Studios, Twitch, Twitch Prime, AWS, and our retail businesses, as well as other areas
8370680	8371720	within Amazon.
8372680	8379400	So it sounds like kind of like what we had with Blizzard, where they're just kind of
8379400	8383480	looking at what's going to be coming in the pipeline and adjusting staff accordingly.
8383480	8386600	And then we also heard about that they canceled a project, too, although I guess most of the
8386600	8388200	programmers moved to other stuff.
8388200	8390680	But maybe, well, we don't know what the project was.
8390680	8394200	It could be, well, the start of the whole Starcraft Ghost, quote unquote thing.
8394200	8395560	Oh, you mean in this case with Amazon?
8395560	8396200	Yeah, yeah.
8396200	8398680	Well, I mean, we know Amazon's got that big MMO.
8399640	8400360	Honestly, I forgot.
8400360	8401720	Of which I completely forgot it.
8401720	8402200	Exactly.
8402200	8402600	Me, too.
8402600	8407000	I hate to say it, but I kind of forgot that that was all a thing until this news about
8407000	8407640	the layoffs came out.
8407640	8411800	And then I'm like, oh, yeah, Amazon was working on that next big MMO.
8411800	8416280	Speaking of one of the previous emails we just had, this next big MMO that they really
8416280	8417000	want people to check out.
8417000	8421080	And I remember we got a little bit of information on it, but here we are, E3, and Amazon hasn't
8421080	8421720	said anything.
8423240	8425400	They said that this layoff does not affect that game.
8425400	8426920	They are working on these games still.
8426920	8429320	It's not that these have been canceled by any means.
8429320	8431320	It's other stuff that we hadn't heard about yet.
8431320	8431880	Yeah.
8431880	8433240	So interesting.
8436360	8438040	New World is the name of that MMO.
8438040	8439400	Thank you, Quest Buster.
8439400	8441800	It had a closed beta earlier this year and then nothing.
8441800	8443880	Oh, I didn't even realize it had a closed beta.
8443880	8445320	So you would think it's getting close.
8445320	8448280	I wonder if Amazon's going to say some more on that.
8448280	8451400	Well, our thoughts to those that were affected by the layoff.
8451400	8455160	It does sound like at least Amazon's being pretty decent about they gave them notice,
8455160	8459640	so they have time to relocate within Amazon and start to look for other work.
8459640	8463640	So it wasn't just like they brought them in and said, bye, your insurance is canceled
8463640	8464040	tomorrow.
8464600	8470360	It sounds like at least for all there's a lot worse ways this could have been handled
8470360	8473640	telltale, but it sounds like this one went all right.
8473640	8474140	Yeah.
8474600	8480600	For as crappy of a situation as it is, it's at least a little bit more of a ramp down
8480600	8482520	instead of just a drop off a cliff.
8482520	8483560	Yeah, I mean, yeah.
8483560	8484680	So all right.
8486200	8488040	Anyhow, let's move on.
8488040	8492200	Oh, this is kind of interesting about, you know, we love our games.
8492200	8492840	At least I do.
8492840	8495320	I play just a little bit of Ingress and Pokemon.
8495320	8501400	I still I don't know if you saw the coverage of like Minecraft Earth in E3, but they know
8501400	8502360	I didn't see any of it.
8502360	8505320	They were shown like different outlets were showing some of the stuff.
8505320	8506760	I really want to play the game.
8506760	8507400	Yeah, let's cool.
8507400	8511320	No, I'm I'm pretty much just like what people don't realize as much as people like to tease
8511320	8514040	me for playing a lot of Ingress and playing a lot of Pokemon go.
8514040	8521000	And rumor, rumor, big are you is that America is getting Harry Potter Wizards Unite this
8521000	8524120	week that there's a big event on Tuesday and it's going to launch in America.
8524120	8529080	And if that's the case, I apologize to all my Ingress friends, but I'm going to be taking
8529080	8531000	that over and split it in the four now.
8531000	8531880	Look, here's the thing.
8531880	8532840	Here's the thing.
8532840	8535080	I'm max level and then summon Ingress.
8535080	8536760	So the whole recursion thing, right?
8536760	8539080	I've looped through the game and I'm back on level 12.
8539080	8539880	I've lapped.
8539960	8542760	So which so which house are you going to be?
8542760	8544440	You don't I don't think you don't pick out.
8544440	8545800	No, it's not PvP.
8545800	8547480	It's it's like a PvE game.
8548040	8550680	So I think still though, I think you still do get to get Slytherin.
8550680	8551640	Of course, I'm picking Slytherin.
8551640	8553560	That's not even because of green, but in part.
8553560	8555000	But yes, Slytherin for sure.
8555000	8556600	Um, if that's an option.
8556600	8557320	But here's the thing.
8557320	8559240	I'm max level in Ingress.
8559240	8560680	I'm max level in Pokemon go.
8560680	8564200	I'm I'm just about to hit 30 million XP cumulative.
8564200	8566840	So 20 million is when you hit level 40.
8566840	8567880	So that'll tell you how much.
8568520	8571080	And I don't even play as much Pokemon go as I was.
8571080	8572360	I caught two shiny stars.
8572360	8575640	I stopped carrying my gotcha with me because I just
8576360	8578280	I have trouble setting it up in the car sometimes.
8578280	8579640	It runs the battery down way too fast.
8579640	8583720	It's just, um, I just don't care enough anymore.
8583720	8586200	I'm like, eh, I miss my bonus.
8586200	8587240	Yeah, whatever.
8587240	8588600	I'll play it sometimes.
8588600	8590680	But like I didn't really play this weekend either.
8590680	8591000	Yeah.
8591000	8593800	Again, and everybody's going like, oh shit in chat.
8593800	8595000	Rumor, big rumor.
8595000	8598520	But there was something about because tangent time
8598520	8600920	before we get to the topic that's actually in the sidebar.
8601480	8607080	So, um, apparently Niantic sued these guys that were making a game
8607080	8610280	called like Ingress plus plus and Pokemon go plus plus
8610280	8615000	that basically had extra utilities and spoofing abilities built into the apps.
8615000	8619160	And they were saying, and I, these people that were making the apps
8619160	8621800	were saying that they were building it for people who can't,
8622360	8626680	who are due to a disability or whatever, can't go out in the real world and play.
8626680	8633080	And I'm kind of like, in the real world, there are lots of disability accessible spots.
8633080	8636600	And I kind of think that's like a misdirect to make people feel bad
8636600	8639240	about what they're really doing, which is the spoofing.
8639240	8643560	I, the spoofing is out of control in a lot of these AR games.
8643560	8644440	And it needs to be dealt with.
8644440	8647800	And so I applaud Niantic for suing this company and they had, they shut down.
8647800	8648600	They're gone now.
8648600	8652200	The next day they were basically like our legal team has told that, you know,
8652200	8653800	they're like, we're going to get sued into oblivion.
8653800	8655400	We have shut down basically.
8655400	8657000	So that all happened.
8657000	8662840	And the question about why now is apparently this company already had,
8662840	8666440	because the Harry Potter game is already out in Australia, New Zealand.
8666440	8667480	It's been testing there.
8667480	8671960	Apparently this company already had its wizard unite plus plus ready to go.
8671960	8674920	And so the reason why Niantic did this when they did this is because
8674920	8678280	rumor they're doing wizard unite this week in the U S and they
8678280	8681080	wanted to get out in front of the cheater train.
8681080	8682440	So that way, when the game launches,
8682440	8684360	it's not rampant with cheaters in the beginning of the game.
8685560	8686360	Interesting, right?
8686360	8688440	I'm just glad Niantic's doing something about it.
8688440	8691640	So, um, where was I before I got into all that?
8691640	8692360	I don't even know.
8692360	8694440	So other AR games.
8694440	8694680	Yeah.
8694680	8696760	SSG, SSG 100 Matt in chat says,
8696760	8699320	Ugh, I hate it when spoofers use that as an excuse.
8699320	8700120	I do too.
8700120	8704440	Like, you know what you're really doing, please, you know?
8704440	8705160	And I, yeah.
8705160	8706840	And SSG 100 Matt says, don't get me wrong.
8706840	8709000	I believe there are people with disabilities that can't play.
8709000	8711880	And it does suck that they can't play, but spoofers use this.
8711880	8714600	And I would be all for something maybe to make, you know,
8714600	8717800	maybe the ball throwing more accessible to somebody or, you know,
8717800	8719720	making some tweaks doing, you know,
8719720	8721640	different types of things that we can do within the game.
8721640	8726360	But I, I think you still need to be able to go out in the real world and,
8726360	8727160	you know, play.
8727160	8730280	And, um, yeah, I think that's, that's what it is for me.
8730920	8731240	All right.
8731960	8736200	Anyhow, going on to other AR games that have nothing to do with Niantic's
8736200	8738360	wheelhouse, but we got on that tangent anyway.
8738360	8740760	So Netflix announced some other games as well.
8740760	8742840	Some stranger things based games.
8742840	8745640	Apparently there's like a Fortnite stranger things collaboration happening.
8745640	8748280	I had no idea that was a thing, but of course it's a thing because Fortnite.
8748280	8749640	They collaborated with everything.
8749640	8750600	Yeah, why not?
8750600	8755720	But, um, apparently there is a Pokemon go style, but see when the media calls
8755720	8758760	it that I go, it doesn't mean that you're going to like throw a ball and
8758760	8761240	catch, you know, Demi Gorgon.
8761240	8764280	And yeah, I don't think it's going to be like Tessa Hydra,
8764280	8768040	but it's a location based game called stranger things, mobile game
8768040	8769720	for Android and iOS.
8769720	8772200	And of course it revolves around the upside down.
8772200	8776040	Now that part I get is that like, Oh, so like, depending on where you are
8776040	8779160	on the phone, you're in the upside down, I would think is the logical,
8779160	8780440	Oh, that's how it's going to work.
8780440	8783000	So maybe you do battle the Demi Gorgons and all this stuff,
8783000	8785240	but where they're at is kind of a real world.
8785240	8785560	I don't know.
8785560	8785960	We'll see.
8785960	8786600	We'll see.
8786600	8790040	Um, but anyway, the game revolves around the upside down and it's all hidden
8790040	8791960	all around you and what you do day to day.
8791960	8795400	And you have to work together with friends to overcome the evils that
8795400	8796760	are escaping from the upside down.
8796760	8797960	It's due next year.
8797960	8801880	It's being made by next games who made our world, which is the walking
8801880	8805640	dead location game, which is like one of the few that I haven't played.
8805640	8807480	Cause I'm just not super into the walking dead.
8807480	8809560	Cause I'm just not super into zombie stuff.
8809560	8812440	Um, anymore like the old stuff's fine.
8812440	8815240	But anyway, um, there's also another game that's coming out called
8815240	8818600	stranger three things, three, the game, uh, that ties into the third
8818600	8821800	season of the TV show, like retro looking game that comes out July
8821800	8822200	2nd.
8822200	8825400	But this is all well, and this is all a reminder that stranger things
8825400	8827400	season three is about to debut on July 4th.
8827400	8829320	Cause we're gonna get in July, not October.
8829320	8831640	So, uh, cause they didn't do one last year.
8831640	8832760	So it's, it's been a while.
8833400	8835160	Yeah, I get, yeah, they didn't do one last year.
8835160	8839560	So, uh, it's, we had to, we've had to wait since October of 2017 for this.
8839560	8841800	Well, that's because the last one took place during Halloween.
8841800	8843640	This one takes place, I think around 4th of July.
8843640	8844360	So it makes sense.
8844360	8844600	Yeah.
8844600	8847320	Well, they also might, that might've been a convenient, you know, the way
8847320	8851080	they wrote it, but I'm not, you know, the first I binged watched the first
8851080	8852680	two seasons, I'll watch this one too.
8852680	8853320	Who are we going to get at?
8853320	8854440	There's very few TV shows.
8854440	8857960	I have this attention span to sit down and watch, but I'll watch it for sure.
8857960	8858840	So I'm excited.
8858840	8859400	I didn't know.
8859400	8862920	I didn't know Netflix put shows out on Blu-ray, but I was at target and they
8862920	8864760	were selling the stranger things box set.
8864760	8867160	And I was like, but Netflix, okay.
8867160	8870360	Wouldn't it cost as much to buy just two months of Netflix?
8870360	8874120	I just watched the new season of, um, black mirror too.
8874120	8878440	Oh, did you, I have not watched it yet, but I can't escape Ashley.
8878440	8884040	Oh, you know, though I'm on a roll achieving my goals.
8884040	8884840	I just, I love that.
8884840	8885400	It's great.
8885400	8886360	How they did that.
8886360	8888280	That, that one is an interesting episode.
8888280	8890120	There's one that has to do with VR.
8890120	8893880	That was, um, interesting to say the least.
8895240	8896520	So, all right.
8896520	8900360	Anyway, uh, let's move on from stranger things AR.
8900360	8901720	Cause that won't be until next year.
8901720	8903880	Anyway, Loki on a little more serious tone.
8903880	8904120	Yeah.
8904120	8905400	Let's talk about riot games.
8905400	8910520	So riot games is being investigated apparently by the department of fair
8910520	8916280	employment and housing, um, in regards to, I guess, on, they had an ongoing
8916280	8922040	investigation to alleged gender discrimination and alleged unequal pay
8922040	8926360	sexual harassment, sexual assault, retaliation, uh, gender discrimination,
8926360	8928680	select a selection and promotion.
8929560	8933240	And apparently the investigation began October, 2018.
8934040	8935080	Uh, right.
8935080	8941880	Says that they have, um, refused to provide the department with adequate
8941880	8942920	information.
8942920	8946920	Um, or I guess they're saying that, uh, the department is saying that riot
8946920	8950360	games has refused to provide them with adequate information.
8950360	8950680	Right.
8950680	8955480	Of course is saying though that they have, you know, been supplying them with
8955480	8962040	tons of information, including 2,500 or, uh, you know, 2,500 pages of documents
8962040	8964680	and several thousand lines of pay data so far.
8965320	8967960	And, uh, they're responding promptly.
8967960	8974120	So we'll have to see how this all shakes up, but, um, yeah, not really a good
8974120	8974920	place to be.
8974920	8975160	Yeah.
8975160	8978680	All I can say is it feels like the situation keeps escalating here for riot.
8978680	8982520	I mean, between, you know, now this outside, I mean, you already had the
8982520	8986840	problems from within with the employees, you know, doing their protests and
8986840	8987480	things.
8987480	8987960	I don't know.
8987960	8991160	Like could, could this end up ruining the company?
8991160	8997960	I mean, it's just, uh, it's not a good base for them, but, um, I mean, it's, I
8997960	9001800	wonder if it's just more of kind of an indication of like kind of the whole,
9002760	9005880	um, like that whole area.
9005880	9010680	And as a whole, like a lot of these big AAA companies, you know, seem to have a
9010680	9011960	lot of the same issues.
9011960	9016120	I'm wondering if we'll see more fallout with, if it's, this is successful, you
9016120	9019160	know, coming from those other companies and maybe a little bit more proactive
9019160	9024680	measures on their part to try to like be more inclusive and just like, don't
9024680	9026680	like treat everybody with respect.
9026680	9028840	Most importantly, you know, don't be a Dick.
9028840	9029000	Yeah.
9029000	9029720	Don't be a Dick.
9029720	9031240	That's very, very simple.
9031240	9033240	So, um, all right.
9033240	9036120	Uh, let's move on here and talk a little bit about something.
9036120	9039800	This is from E3, but I thought this was, um, really cool for, uh, especially
9039800	9042280	those collectors that like to get those little arcade cabinets.
9042280	9045240	Uh, those little arcade one up cabinets are getting bigger.
9045240	9046040	They're getting bigger.
9046040	9047720	They got some bigger licenses.
9047720	9051960	So they, they, you know, before we had kind of like a lot of the same Atari
9051960	9053240	things we've been seeing for a while.
9053240	9056120	Then we started to hear about mortal combat trilogy, you know, street
9056120	9056920	fighters, pretty cool.
9056920	9057160	Yeah.
9057160	9057560	Yeah.
9057560	9059960	And now, now they're getting some big ones.
9059960	9062840	Teenage mutant Ninja turtles, arcade one up.
9062840	9063320	That's right.
9063320	9065880	With Ninja turtles and turtles in time.
9065880	9067800	And it's four players full.
9067800	9068120	Awesome.
9068120	9070120	So these are those replica arcade cabinets.
9070120	9073560	They're not quite as big as an actual arcade cabinet, but they're great for
9073560	9076360	like a bar top or, you know, they're, they're pretty, they're pretty big.
9076360	9076600	Yeah.
9077480	9080680	It's very comparable to what you used to have in here, which by the way is the,
9080680	9081960	the coding place.
9081960	9083720	Uh, it's in the back room right now.
9083720	9087400	Cause they have to filter out some of the games that were on there because
9087400	9091320	apparently when I filtered it out, I only did it for the main category.
9091320	9094840	But if you go into subcategories, it's all of the games on there.
9094840	9098360	And so they need to just, they want to filter it down to it's like several
9098360	9099480	thousand games right now.
9099480	9101560	They want to just put like a few on there.
9101560	9102840	So they are just working on that.
9102840	9105320	My favorite thing though, about the Ninja turtles 90s cabinet that they're
9105320	9109160	putting out is that they are retaining the 1990s Ninja turtles art complete
9109160	9114120	with that April O'Neil, with that, just that wig that she's got that huge red
9114120	9115320	wig that she has.
9115320	9117640	And that yellow jumpsuit that she's wearing.
9117640	9122280	Like it's like, it's some like Evangeline's costume mansion, Halloween
9122280	9123320	realness.
9123320	9125320	It's going to be, uh, it's, it's great.
9125320	9126120	I love it.
9126120	9129240	Um, but that's not all the, I keep focusing on Ninja turtles, but there's
9129240	9129960	other ones too.
9129960	9135160	There's a Marvel superheroes machine with Marvel superheroes, X-Men children
9135160	9135960	of the Adam.
9135960	9136840	Whoa, that game is huge.
9136840	9137720	And the Punisher.
9137720	9139560	That's going to be a hell of a cabinet.
9139560	9143000	And then, so they announced those and then they announced one more during the
9143000	9143240	show.
9143240	9146200	And this one, like I had to text my friend melody right away.
9146200	9150920	Cause she is a huge fan of star Wars and there's going to be another cabinet
9150920	9154680	with star Wars, the empire strikes back and the return of the Jedi.
9154680	9159160	All of those Atari vector games, complete with that yolk controller.
9159160	9160600	That is bad-ass.
9160600	9164520	So, um, it's almost like, I mean, I wish I had the room to just collect
9164520	9165000	some of them.
9165000	9165160	God.
9165160	9165320	Right.
9165320	9168440	But these, these are like hundreds of dollars each, but I'm like, Oh my God.
9168440	9174520	I see my, my future basement getting nuttier and nuttier with these, uh,
9174520	9174920	things.
9174920	9177960	I'm surprised they haven't done like replica pinball machines yet.
9177960	9181720	I'm curious, careful, careful, careful what you're thinking.
9181720	9183800	Cause I bet that might be a future direction they go in.
9183800	9186920	I want to know if Bobby Black Wolf has started eyeing these, if he's got a
9186920	9189560	little eye on these going, I might have to do this.
9189560	9195240	So it was, I I'm curious if any of these newer ones have tempted him.
9195240	9197560	Cause I know he's thinking about building his basement arcade at some
9197560	9197720	point.
9197720	9199560	I think he wants to finish everything you wanted.
9199560	9201080	I need to fix up my cabinet.
9201080	9203320	They have, cause it, the monitors out on it.
9203320	9206680	And the problem is with that is like, it's already blasphemous.
9206680	9213640	I painted it black cause it's a SIG Astra city and, um, everyone paints it
9213640	9215400	white because it's a white cabinet.
9215400	9217320	I wanted to be different and painted black.
9217320	9219240	So already it's an outcast.
9219240	9224600	But, um, I wanted to get the monitor fixed and I don't know how to exactly
9224600	9225240	to do that.
9225800	9230760	Um, I may end up having to replace it with an LCD, but you know, they don't
9230760	9233080	make four by three LCDs anymore.
9233080	9238600	So I may have to do something not so nice and like get a, you know, 16 by
9238600	9242760	nine TV and try to shove it in there, uh, which worked okay for my DDR
9242760	9243240	machine.
9243240	9248760	So, I mean, it would be fine, but, um, I would like to get that working again.
9248760	9251960	And just to be clear, Bobby black Wolf does say in our chat room, I might
9251960	9252920	get the star Wars one.
9253560	9255080	So he's thinking about it.
9255080	9255960	He's thinking about it.
9255960	9257480	Anyway, just a couple more stories for you guys.
9257480	9260120	Then we're going to invite your calls on our discord channel.
9260120	9263880	If you want to join the green room, just head over to head over to vog
9263880	9265640	network.com slash discord.
9265640	9269560	That'll get you the invite generated into our discord server and you can join
9269560	9271720	and hang head over to the green room.
9271720	9275160	And it's also great if you could tell us what you'd like to call in about in
9275160	9277480	our channel for orange lounge radio.
9277480	9280840	We are running a little long tonight with this being, we got a late start and
9280840	9282040	it is knee three episodes.
9282040	9285400	So I I'm not like, if there's not people wanting to call in, I'm going to move
9285400	9288360	right along, but I do want to give an opportunity for folks to call in.
9288360	9289960	We will get to that in just a moment.
9289960	9292280	We have a couple more stories for you first before we get there.
9292280	9292520	Yeah.
9292520	9295960	So there's this game called platigo super platform game maker.
9295960	9298280	And it basically is what it sounds like.
9298280	9303640	It's sort of like, um, I guess a little bit like Mario maker, a little bit like
9303640	9306920	RPG maker in which you can make your own platform games.
9306920	9311240	And so what's kind of cool about it is they have, um, it is available now on the
9311240	9313160	switch and on steam.
9313160	9316520	You can actually make, um, retro games similar.
9316520	9317800	They have different like art styles.
9317800	9322680	So they have like super Nintendo game boy, Commodore 64 styles, Amiga, you can
9322680	9324760	design different traps platforms.
9325400	9330520	You can even re you know, create your own custom sprites and everything for the
9330520	9331640	games themselves.
9331640	9332760	It looks pretty cool.
9332760	9335640	Uh, it's like 20 bucks right now on steam.
9335720	9339480	I don't know if I would pick this up because I probably wouldn't do anything
9339480	9341320	with it or wouldn't finish anything with it.
9341320	9344760	And we all know, you know, we all know how that is.
9344760	9347000	So, um, but it looks neat.
9347000	9349960	Um, I'd be curious to see how you can share out this type of stuff.
9349960	9353320	I know they showed in the trailer that you can link your levels together so you
9353320	9356840	can make like your whole, make a whole game out of it if you wanted to.
9356840	9360840	Um, so I'd be curious to see like how this is shared on there.
9360840	9364040	If they have like steam, uh, workshop support or something like that.
9364040	9364920	That'd be cool.
9364920	9368760	I was looking at, it looks a little Mario maker to me, so it looks pretty easy to
9368760	9369080	do.
9369080	9369240	Yeah.
9369240	9372680	And they've got some sprites that comes with in different enemies already, but you
9372680	9376520	can like customize gravity so you can kind of do like a little bit like a VVVV.
9377080	9379720	Um, they had different hazards.
9379720	9382200	I don't know what the limitations are on there.
9382200	9385160	The reviews seem to be pretty positive from what I've seen.
9385160	9389960	There were some that, you know, they wish that you can export the game to its own
9389960	9391320	executable or something like that.
9391320	9394680	So you can, I don't know, sell it or share it or whatever.
9394760	9397960	But being that, like you can kind of steal sprites from other things.
9397960	9398280	I don't know.
9399080	9400600	Let's learn game maker at that point.
9400600	9404440	But, um, how long is it going to take before you see a world one, one remake?
9404440	9404680	Right.
9404680	9409720	Oh, I probably already haven't, but, um, how long before we see a level full of
9409720	9412280	dicks, but it's, it's cool to like it for 20 bucks.
9412280	9412920	That's not bad.
9412920	9416840	I mean, compared to like RPG maker, which is like $70 for that shit.
9416840	9418360	You know, you should catch it on a sale, but yeah.
9418360	9419000	Yeah, exactly.
9419000	9421640	So, um, eh, maybe worth checking out.
9422200	9422840	Yeah, for sure.
9423480	9423880	All right.
9423960	9428440	Well, moving on to one more topic here tonight that has to do with Square Enix.
9428440	9432040	And you know, a lot of people very jazzed to hear about that Final Fantasy
9432040	9437560	Eight remaster and are wondering, could, could maybe Square want to do a Chrono?
9437560	9440440	You want to say the word Chrono in a remaster?
9440440	9441400	Well, here's the thing.
9441400	9446440	Square Enix does want to make their entire back catalog available digitally.
9446440	9452280	That includes things like Rad Racer, 3D World Runner and some of those types of games.
9452280	9453320	But here's the catch.
9454120	9458760	So Square Enix president and CEO Yosuke Matsuda said in an interview, quote,
9458760	9460600	we're working on that in a variety of ways.
9460600	9463560	That is a request we hear often as far as our major titles go.
9463560	9466600	Most of those, we still have variations out that you can play now.
9466600	9469320	God, I would love them to bring back Rad Racer as a franchise.
9469320	9470520	We'd be fucking awesome.
9470520	9473240	The more classic titles that you might've played on NES,
9473240	9475800	we're still working hard to make it so you can play those.
9475800	9479400	We actually have launched a dedicated project internally to port those.
9479400	9482360	So we're working to make them available on a variety of platforms.
9482360	9484760	So at least the old Rad Racer, it sounds like you might be able to play.
9484760	9487080	I hope they keep the support for the 3D.
9487080	9487960	That would be great.
9487960	9491000	If you could find an older retro eighties pair of glasses, that would be great.
9492680	9497080	Certainly down the road, we would like to see that on a subscription or streaming service.
9499400	9502840	So we're exploring the possibility of creating a dedicated channel for ourselves.
9503480	9505560	I think everyone is going in that direction streaming.
9505560	9508120	So we do want to be proactive in considering those options.
9508120	9509960	We still don't know if it would take a subscription service
9509960	9512360	or an exclusive downloading service or what form it might take,
9512360	9514040	but we do want to leverage our catalog.
9514040	9519400	I'm embarrassed to admit it, but in some cases, we don't know where the code is anymore.
9519400	9522040	It's very hard to find them sometimes because back in the day,
9522040	9524600	you just made them and put them out there and you were done.
9524600	9527400	You didn't think of how you were going to sell them down the road.
9527400	9530680	Sometimes customers ask, why haven't you released that game yet?
9530680	9533480	And the truth of the matter is it's because we don't know where it's gone.
9534440	9537880	And like I believe it, like he's absolutely right.
9537880	9539960	Back in the day, it was just get the game out.
9539960	9541960	You don't think about, oh yeah, I got to get the game out
9541960	9546040	and then I want to release it again in 10 more years and it's remastered.
9546040	9548040	People weren't thinking like that back then.
9548040	9549960	So which is probably a good thing, right?
9549960	9552920	But they weren't necessarily retaining the source code.
9552920	9558680	So either they're having to go like reverse compile things or I don't know how they're doing it.
9558680	9562360	Or like go find the guy who wrote it and make him remember how he did it
9562360	9563880	and that whole type of thing.
9563880	9567240	So anyway, by the way, a lot of people in our chat room,
9567240	9569640	pipe it up at the whole rad racer thing.
9569640	9571160	That would be an awesome, like I would,
9571160	9574920	even if Square Enix kind of like gave the ability to do that to somebody else.
9574920	9578920	Cause I think they could really do anything they want with rad racer.
9580920	9583400	The original rad racer, the kick was 3d, right?
9584120	9587080	How about rad racer as a VR Square Enix game?
9589560	9590060	Yeah.
9590700	9593500	Look, if I'm not going to get my, but yeah, it could be,
9593500	9595340	it could be pretty rad racer VR.
9595340	9596540	I'd be into that.
9596540	9597040	Hell yeah.
9598460	9600620	Anyway, um, yeah.
9600620	9601980	Act deft and chat says, who knew?
9601980	9603740	Retro video games would have been profitable.
9603740	9604060	Yeah.
9604060	9605340	SSG100 Matt says, yeah.
9605340	9607580	Back in the day archiving wasn't a thing.
9607580	9611660	Um, DJ Rama S says, I thought they were going to announce rad racer three,
9611660	9613100	but that was another racing game.
9613100	9614780	Square Enix is a backing.
9614780	9615340	Well, yeah, that's right.
9615340	9616460	There was a rad racer too.
9616460	9619660	I always forget that they, they actually did have a rad racer too at one point,
9619740	9624300	but it's, it's, uh, you know, pretty easy to forget that that existed.
9624300	9624860	All right.
9624860	9627420	Anyhow, uh, let's go to listener round table.
9627420	9630380	If you want to give us a call, you can, uh, head on over to our discord server,
9630380	9631820	but you want to get over there pretty quickly.
9631820	9633340	I'm not going to leave it open long.
9633340	9636620	Also, if you have questions in chat, if you're like, eh, it's not really worth calling in.
9636620	9638060	I just want to ask this question.
9638060	9640220	You can go ahead and put that out in our chat room.
9640220	9643100	Uh, and, um, see, we'll, we'll get around to it.
9643660	9649020	Bobby Black Wolf does point out the BBC destroyed old shows because they needed the shell space.
9649020	9652220	Hence why many early doctor who episodes are lost.
9652220	9652460	Yeah.
9652460	9657340	They had to either like, like they had to find the one guy in the middle of nowhere who taped it
9657340	9660380	or like they, I think there's one episode they stitched together.
9660380	9665180	Like they had the audio only because somebody had taped the audio and they stitched it together
9665180	9666700	with like production stills or something.
9666700	9670140	I think there's an episode like that out there, but the BBC destroyed things.
9670140	9675180	There was a big news article this week about how some music masters were lost in universal
9675180	9678300	studios fire a few years ago, which is really sad.
9678300	9678940	Yeah.
9678940	9681900	So anyway, uh, before we get to calls, uh, quickly checking in to see if there's any
9681900	9687900	last minute stories, I guess E3 and all that.
9687900	9688300	Yeah.
9688300	9691500	Kind of a lot of nerve there were, yeah, I hear you.
9691500	9693740	Anyway, we do have a call coming in, so let's get to it.
9693740	9694860	Hi, you're on orange launch radio.
9694860	9695180	Who's this?
9695740	9696700	Hey, what's up everyone?
9696700	9697500	It's Rama.
9697500	9697980	Hey Rama.
9697980	9698780	Good to hear from you, buddy.
9698780	9699420	What's up, buddy?
9699420	9699740	What's up?
9699740	9700780	It's good to hear from you too.
9700780	9705580	But yeah, I was really hyped for that ride race of three, but it was different, uh, racing
9705580	9705820	game.
9706620	9708060	I, I would love it.
9708060	9711740	If square Enix would revisit that property, they don't even have to call it rad racer
9711740	9711980	three.
9711980	9712300	Come on.
9712300	9713100	It's been this long.
9713100	9714380	They can just call it rad racer.
9714380	9715660	I think people would lose their minds.
9715660	9716220	It'd be awesome.
9717340	9718060	Exactly.
9718060	9721980	But I called it not to talk about themes or E3 at the moment.
9723500	9723900	I'm sorry.
9723900	9724460	Say that again.
9725340	9728540	I said, I called it not to talk about E3, but something else.
9728540	9729020	Oh, okay.
9729020	9729340	Sure.
9729340	9729840	What?
9731180	9735260	Did you see the season premiere of pressure luck and card sharks?
9736620	9737740	I haven't yet.
9737740	9742140	I'm sorry to let you down, but they're an hour, I guess, and not 30 minutes.
9742140	9745420	So I just, I haven't got around to it, but I think they're on, they're on Hulu or something,
9745420	9745660	right?
9745660	9746620	So I'll get around to it.
9746620	9752220	I just, I didn't get to it this last week, but I heard, I heard, um, I heard pressure
9752220	9754540	luck was good except for that weird bonus round.
9754540	9755420	I guess they have at the end.
9756060	9757500	Yeah, that was my main issue.
9757500	9760300	That took up like the second half hour of the show.
9761900	9764060	Oh God, that's a long bonus round.
9764940	9769420	Yeah, basically you have a chance to go up against a big board and you get like six chances,
9769420	9774060	but as you make it past six chances, you get four chances and so on and so forth.
9774060	9778300	So amass as much money as you can, but if you get the whammy four times, that's it.
9779260	9779760	Interesting.
9780940	9784060	Well, I mean, I guess they had to think of a way to extend it to an hour, but I mean,
9784060	9786300	if 30 minutes works, just keep it at 30 minutes.
9786300	9790620	It is, it's, it's tough though, when you're a prime time show, I think there's a certain
9791260	9797340	expectation that may have worked a little better in daytime, but, um, I, I, I hear Elizabeth
9797340	9800940	Banks is doing a good job as a host since, you know, I think they wanted to go a very,
9800940	9802460	very different direction.
9802460	9804700	You know, obviously Peter Tamarkin is no longer with us.
9804700	9806700	So I think they just wanted to go a really different direction.
9806700	9809820	It sounds like they, they got a good result with, um, Elizabeth Banks.
9810540	9812220	Yeah, she was pretty sassy.
9812220	9813500	You'd be proud.
9813500	9814460	Good, good.
9814460	9817740	And then, uh, Card Sharks, uh, look, I heard it was a lot of fun.
9818540	9821580	I was pleasantly surprised by Joel McHale hosting it.
9822780	9823020	Yeah.
9823020	9826620	Sometimes he can be really annoying, but when he's not like, he's really funny.
9827420	9827660	Yeah.
9828220	9830780	That was two episodes built into an hour.
9830780	9832780	Like they did with Celebrity Family Feud.
9832780	9837660	They did change the rounds where they said it's like two rounds of five cards.
9837660	9839820	Each is one round of 10 cards.
9840940	9841260	Okay.
9841820	9843980	Well, that's, that's what they should do with Press Your Luck then.
9843980	9847420	They shouldn't feel the need to make it an hour and they just make it two half hour episodes
9847420	9848380	back to back or something.
9848380	9851420	That's, uh, yeah.
9851420	9852300	Now here's, okay.
9852300	9857100	So since it is a video game podcast, you know, a lot of early video games and certainly things
9857100	9860620	that I remember playing a lot of like good old Commodore 64 and stuff that I remember
9860620	9863740	playing was conversions of game shows.
9863740	9868220	So do you think that whole game show Renaissance we're seeing, especially on ABC is like their
9868220	9872780	summer programming because God, what you have Press Your Luck, you have Card Sharks, you
9872780	9875100	have the a hundred thousand dollar pyramid is still a thing, right?
9875100	9876940	Or whatever they call it now, pyramid, whatever it is.
9877020	9877980	That's still a thing, right?
9877980	9879260	Match game is still a thing.
9879260	9880940	Family Feud is still a thing.
9880940	9885500	Yet, I don't think we have a video game conversion for any of these, not a modern one.
9885500	9888140	Granted, you know, a lot, those games that have been around forever.
9888140	9889340	Well, are they on mobile though?
9889980	9890860	Oh God.
9890860	9892380	Why did you have to go there?
9892380	9897660	They are mobile, but I think there, I think it might've been Ubisoft or another company
9897660	9902620	going back to me about five, six, seven years, they did have like those games.
9902620	9907660	Like there was a Price is Right game.
9907660	9911740	I've seen that like as a pack-in game on various laptops and desktops back in the day.
9912860	9913580	Yeah, true.
9913580	9917100	And some folks in chat are naming, there's other game shows still around as well.
9917100	9919980	Of course, you know, your old standards, Wheel of Fortune and Jeopardy, those have been on
9919980	9920700	forever.
9920700	9926140	And I guess Alex Trebek is doing better, which is fantastic to hear.
9926140	9930140	Jeopardy's kind of having a Renaissance right now when you got that guy that was so close
9930140	9933340	to breaking the record and then just had a bad day or something.
9933340	9934700	Didn't, didn't make it at the end there.
9935340	9938620	But you know, Jeopardy's kind of having a Renaissance right now between all those things.
9938620	9940540	And I feel like that game's going to be around forever.
9940540	9943580	And you know, those make for some good game show conversions as well.
9944860	9946300	Let's see, what else are they saying here?
9946940	9947820	Oh yeah.
9947820	9951020	The Are You Smarter Than a Fifth Grader just got rebooted as well.
9951020	9954460	My kids totally want to see it now because they're huge fans of John Cena.
9954460	9957580	We saw the trailer before they had like the previews before the
9958460	9959660	Secret Life of Pets 2.
9959660	9962860	So they're like, Oh my God, we've got to watch this show because John Cena is in it.
9962860	9964700	So he's fun.
9964700	9966700	Make sure you show your kids Double Dare as well.
9967900	9970300	Oh yeah, the Double Dare reboot's apparently really good too.
9970300	9970700	Yeah.
9970700	9971420	It's so good.
9972460	9973980	So yeah, game shows are-
9973980	9977820	I just got to figure out which streaming service that's on because I don't have technically
9977820	9981180	cable, but I have like Hulu and Amazon and Netflix.
9982060	9984620	I just don't think any of those have those.
9984620	9986860	It's like probably its own standalone Nickelodeon.
9987340	9990140	Kaijuto in chat says game shows never went away.
9990140	9993900	They just bring back old classics, but we've had primetime game shows for decades that
9993900	9994700	hasn't changed.
9994700	9995740	That's true.
9995740	9997820	I mean, you know, game shows have kind of always been a thing.
9997820	10003020	Well, especially in daytime, like The Price is Right hasn't stopped since the sixties
10003020	10004780	when that's, I mean, that show has been on forever.
10004780	10007500	Wheel of Fortune and Jeopardy, they've been on nonstop since the eighties.
10008220	10011180	And Let's Make a Deal is on CBS.
10011180	10012060	Oh yeah, that's back.
10012060	10015100	Let's Make a Deal has been on for quite some time for sure.
10015500	10019180	And then, you know, there's always Games for Network and also game shows kind of took a
10019180	10023740	little turn and not everybody's going to be a fan of this, but in some ways, things like
10023740	10026540	Survivor are a game show, right?
10026540	10028780	Yeah, you do win a million dollars, right?
10028780	10030460	And it is a game that they're playing.
10030460	10032620	It's just a very different, very psychological game.
10032620	10035980	That's not always glamorous, but Survivor in many ways is a game show.
10035980	10040460	It's just a very different type that then kind of started its own genre where you still
10040460	10041900	have Amazing Race on there.
10041900	10043340	Amazing Race is still going.
10044140	10045420	Don't get out of the kitchen.
10045420	10046220	I mean, come on.
10046220	10051900	It's Amazing Race is meta at this point because Amazing Race this current season is all, it's
10051900	10057020	either people that prior played the Amazing Race versus Survivor contestants as teams
10057020	10059500	versus Big Brother contestants as teams.
10059500	10060700	So that's all getting meta.
10060700	10062140	And Big Brother is another type.
10062140	10064780	Then Big Brother is kind of like the Jerry Springer of game shows.
10066380	10069100	But I live for it.
10069100	10070380	I'll watch it for sure.
10070380	10075660	So, yeah, Bobby Black Wolf in chat says the mole with Anderson Cooper is still the best.
10075660	10076860	Co-signed.
10076860	10080940	Man, I wish they'd bring back the mole, which I realized they've already done twice, but
10080940	10082700	they haven't done it as good as the first time.
10082700	10085420	They need to find a host as good as Anderson Cooper.
10085420	10086060	I know.
10086620	10089660	I mean, you might say nobody is going to be as good as Anderson Cooper and that may or
10089660	10089900	may not.
10089900	10091420	No, I would be as good as Anderson Cooper.
10091420	10092860	I will host the fucking mole reboot.
10093580	10096460	Somebody, but obviously they're not going to give me a call.
10097260	10099020	Obviously they're not going to give me a call.
10099020	10101820	Somebody out there has got to have that tongue in cheek.
10102460	10107100	Who could, who would be a good person that's like kind of serious when they need to be,
10107100	10110060	but very tongue in cheek when the time is appropriate.
10110060	10112300	I think kind of Jeff Probst is very good at this too.
10112300	10117100	Although I think Jeff Probst was, is kind of a better host than he is a producer.
10117100	10117900	I'm not sure.
10117900	10120780	Like this last season of Survivor was not good.
10120780	10124860	And this new season of Survivor is looking a little, but
10125020	10127660	as far as Survivor goes, there's an all winners edition.
10127660	10129180	That's like the next one.
10129660	10132940	And everybody, like everybody's hyped about that.
10132940	10137020	Like, because it's going to be, because you believe it or not guys, Survivor is coming
10137020	10139340	up on its 40th season.
10139340	10144620	So this next one's 39 in the fall, 40 is going to be, so for their 40th edition, they found
10144620	10149820	16 prior winners to make up the cast because they have so many people to choose from.
10149820	10151660	So now the winners are going to do battle.
10151660	10153340	So that's, that's pretty cool though.
10153580	10157820	So somebody is going to go from winning the game to getting voted out first, but that
10157820	10159180	already happened actually.
10159180	10163820	Survivor geek, for back in the day, I don't watch the new ones as much, but the old ones
10163820	10167340	that happened to Tina, she won Survivor, the Australian Outback, and then Survivor All-Stars,
10167340	10170780	she got voted out first because she was a prior winner.
10170780	10172220	So, whoops.
10172220	10174540	Anyway, yes.
10174540	10179820	Going to chat over at Twitch, Act F says one versus 100 in video game form again.
10179820	10180620	That'd be great.
10180620	10182940	DJ Rama S says Millionaire was canceled.
10182940	10186700	Yeah, Millionaire was going for a long time and it went through many hosts.
10186700	10190060	Like it had, obviously the Regis Philbin won in prime time, but the Meredith Vieira one
10190060	10191500	went for a long time.
10191500	10193180	And then who hosted after her?
10193180	10196060	Cedric the Entertainer, I think, for a minute.
10196060	10203020	And then they had one of the guys from Dancing with the Stars did it, and then now it's done.
10203020	10204140	I don't think it's on anymore.
10204140	10208380	So, oh, Shane says it's not 16 winners.
10208620	10210540	Oh, Shane says it's not 16 winners.
10210540	10211420	It's 20.
10211420	10212140	Holy crap.
10212780	10216140	And no, apparently Richard Hatch is not in it for whatever reason.
10217100	10222140	People are speculating it could be because of the jail time that he served from not paying
10222140	10228700	his taxes the first time, or the fact that there was something that really, really hasn't
10228700	10229260	aged well.
10229260	10232300	Well, it wasn't good when it happened, but in the original All-Stars...
10232300	10233580	Didn't I just talk about this on OR?
10233580	10235020	Yes, like last week.
10235020	10237100	Go back to OR like three weeks ago, I talked about this earlier.
10237100	10239420	It was a sexual harassment thing that happened, and it wasn't good.
10239420	10244700	So anyway, okay, enough about the old game shows.
10245660	10249740	What game show would you want to see them make a new video game out of most of all?
10250780	10251740	Oh, man.
10254140	10259420	I mean, with interactivity and so forth, I would have to say it would have to be a toss-up
10259420	10264220	between Double Dare or Funhaus, because I love to live in daylight to hope those game shows.
10265020	10268300	It'll be hard to translate those to video games, though, but they are fun shows.
10268300	10271180	But it's just not the same if you don't have actual gak to go through.
10271180	10271980	I got a good one.
10271980	10272220	Okay.
10272860	10275420	So I want to see a VR version of Nick Arcade.
10276620	10280220	So like, you're actually standing up, you know, hitting the buzzer and everything like
10280220	10283580	that, and we have to go into the actual arcade, like, arcade game.
10283580	10284860	It'd be VR, and you can just...
10285820	10286700	Okay, all right.
10287340	10288380	Um, my answer...
10288380	10290300	I just wanted to bring back 1 vs 100.
10290300	10292940	I think that was a great concept that was ahead of its time.
10292940	10293980	Or VR Guts.
10293980	10297100	Let's just do VR, all of the Nick, all the Nick stuff.
10297100	10297740	Yeah.
10297740	10298240	All right.
10298700	10300460	Rama, I'm going to let you go so we can wrap up the show.
10300460	10301260	But thanks for the call.
10301260	10302940	You know, I'll always talk about old game shows.
10303900	10306380	Let me just say 1 vs 100 before I get out of here.
10306380	10306700	Yeah.
10306700	10309740	One night, a special all-anime edition.
10309740	10315500	So all of my squad were on Xbox Live, trash-talking each other, going through the questions.
10316380	10321420	At the end of the round, at the end of the game, I was up there at the number two slot.
10321420	10323260	And I wish I still had a screenshot of that.
10324620	10325900	Nice, nice.
10325900	10326780	That's great.
10326780	10328060	I wish I was around the night.
10328060	10330940	They did like a video game trivia night, but I couldn't make it.
10330940	10332380	But I know I would have kicked butt at it.
10332380	10338620	But I need to get motivated and really assert myself to do more game show hosting panels at cons.
10338620	10341020	I really should have bid to try to do one at Dragon Comet.
10341020	10343100	It's one of those things I just didn't think of until after the fact.
10343100	10347580	But I would love to host more game shows at conventions because I think it's a lot of fun.
10347580	10351180	And some of the ones that I've been to needed some help.
10351180	10353420	So that's my goal.
10353420	10355020	I think I'm gonna make that a goal in the next year.
10355020	10358060	I will host a game show at a convention and it will be awesome.
10358780	10362460	Rob, you need to get connected to some various people because that's the big thing,
10362460	10363820	especially anime con.
10363820	10370060	There are game show departments and you got people who are writing horror point presentations
10370060	10373500	and flash games templates just to run these game shows.
10373500	10379180	And I'm actually trying to put something together like Family Feud set up for a con next year.
10381020	10381660	That'll be fun.
10382620	10383420	Yeah.
10383420	10384220	All right.
10384220	10384860	All right, my friend.
10384860	10385740	I'm gonna let you go.
10385740	10386380	So take care.
10387180	10387660	You too.
10387660	10388620	Stay fabulous, man.
10388620	10389340	I will.
10389340	10389740	Take care.
10389740	10389900	Bye.
10391260	10391820	All right.
10391820	10393580	Always good to hear from Rama.
10393580	10394460	But that is gonna do it.
10394460	10395740	Nobody else is waiting on Discord.
10395740	10399420	So we'll go ahead and close down Discord because I think it's about time we wrap up the show
10400460	10402220	and get on out of here for the night.
10402220	10404700	So I want to thank you all for listening though tonight.
10404700	10408380	Whether you were watching along with us live on Twitch or you're listening to this on the podcast
10408380	10412700	feed where of course the show is still always available in places like iTunes, Google Play
10412700	10413500	Store and so on.
10413500	10416620	Yes, I know we need to get into more places and I'm going to be working on that in the
10416620	10417660	very new future.
10417660	10423900	I'm also, since next week is a birthday show of sorts, I am working on some things for
10423900	10431820	next week to try to, as has been said in one Food Network guy, kick it up a notch a little
10431820	10432060	bit.
10432060	10436540	So in other words, what he's trying to tell you is that he's going to be acquiring a buzzer.
10437500	10438540	That too.
10438540	10439660	I'll be working on that.
10439660	10442060	That wasn't on my list until tonight, but there it is.
10442060	10446940	Anyway, so if you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Laundry tonight, tell a friend or
10446940	10447580	two about the show.
10447580	10450380	Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice.
10450380	10455020	But if the voices aren't here to put out on the air, then how can we possibly air them?
10455020	10459580	So with that, Loki, thank you, of course, for being here as you always are.
10459580	10461660	Do you have any last thoughts for listeners tonight?
10462300	10463420	I may stream this week.
10463420	10463820	I don't know.
10463820	10470460	Depends whether I decide to do some streaming or be ridiculous and work extra long hours
10470460	10471340	on work stuff.
10472460	10473580	So, you know, I don't know.
10473580	10477020	We'll see how it goes, but I've got several nights I can do it, so.
10479740	10480300	We'll see.
10480300	10481500	Or I could clean the house.
10482540	10484940	None of those sound like fun ideas, except for streaming.
10484940	10485820	That's why you have kids.
10485820	10486860	Make them clean.
10486860	10489260	Or they don't eat dinner.
10489260	10489740	Or they don't.
10489740	10490380	Yeah, right.
10491340	10498300	Anyway, my final thought for the night is, hey, if you if you can get your butt to Dragon
10498300	10503180	Con over Labor Day weekend in Atlanta, I can't say too much, but some of the early stuff
10503180	10506620	is starting to take shape and it's going to it's going to be a heck of a year.
10506620	10508220	It's going to be a really fun year.
10508220	10510300	I'm finally getting extra for to go this year.
10510300	10511900	Need I say more that alone?
10511900	10515820	I really want to before there's any talk about any panels or any of that stuff.
10515820	10517900	That alone should be the reason to go to Dragon Con.
10517900	10518620	It's gonna be fun.
10518620	10519740	How many days is Dragon Con?
10520780	10521500	It runs.
10521500	10522700	It's technically now.
10522700	10524300	Thursday is technically a day now.
10524300	10528460	It was Thursday through Sunday, Thursday through Monday, Monday weekend, Thursday,
10528460	10529740	you don't have to go every day.
10529740	10530780	A lot of locals don't.
10530780	10533180	They just go to the parade and maybe go to a day on Saturday.
10533180	10538780	But no, this year I'm going to be gone this year for nine days.
10538780	10541900	I think it is because I'm going to visit extra for North Carolina.
10541900	10542700	I'm actually going to miss.
10542700	10546860	So at the end of August, just to warn you guys, we're going to miss two weeks of our.
10546860	10551020	I'm really sorry, but hey, Dragon Con is just that big a deal this year
10551740	10553340	where we're going to miss one week because Dragon Con,
10553340	10556460	I'm actually flying out the Saturday before, so I'll miss that Sunday.
10556460	10560300	So my hope is we can actually prior record so that we don't miss a time,
10560300	10562140	but we'll have a prior recorded show the week before.
10562140	10567660	Or we'll just do the Orange Lounge Pirate Radio Show where I will host in my dirty ass garage.
10567660	10569740	You and Jamie have every right to take over for a night.
10569740	10572220	It's just, you know, you got to get me the MP3 so we can get it posted.
10572220	10575020	But yeah, the Pirate Radio version, that'd be a lot of fun.
10575020	10576060	So, all right.
10577500	10579500	Anyway, yeah.
10579500	10581660	Bobby Blackwell says our Dragon Con starts Wednesday.
10581660	10585660	We'll try to film something at Dragon Con and premiere it on our usual slot.
10585660	10590620	That's also a good call is that we will probably film something.
10590620	10593340	And because Twitch does let us do video on demand,
10593340	10596460	we can probably actually film, edit and have it up
10597020	10601660	on the Twitch TV for Sunday night at 8 Eastern, 5 Pacific.
10601660	10602780	So that's very likely.
10602780	10605420	It won't be like OLR and it won't be Bobby Blackwell,
10605420	10609340	but it'll be some of the faces having fun at Dragon Con.
10609340	10610380	I think it'll be a good time.
10610380	10611820	So anyway, but stay tuned for that.
10611820	10613020	That's still a few months away.
10613020	10616300	I would just encourage you to be there in person in Atlanta if you can.
10616300	10617580	But we're going to wrap up this week's show.
10617580	10622540	We'll be back in seven days to celebrate 17 years of Orange Lounge Radio.
10623340	10624540	17 years.
10624540	10626780	Old enough, just about old enough to vote.
10626780	10628140	Old enough to have a job.
10628140	10629820	Old enough to be a senior in high school.
10629820	10634860	We'll be back here to celebrate that next week with you all.
10635500	10637420	Many opportunities to call in next week
10637420	10638940	and hopefully some other special treats as well.
10638940	10642220	So we really hope you'll join us here for our 17th birthday next week.
10642220	10644140	In the meantime, happy gaming.
10644140	10645340	Lots of games to play.
10645340	10647020	Go play them and be nice.
10647020	10647260	Bye.
10648220	10650860	You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
