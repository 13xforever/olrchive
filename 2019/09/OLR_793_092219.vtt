00:00.000 --> 00:16.960
This week it's been enough generations that everything old is new again.

00:16.960 --> 00:20.360
Katamari Damacy Encore was just the first of Bandai Namco's offerings with many more

00:20.360 --> 00:22.120
to come, at least in Japan.

00:22.120 --> 00:24.900
This is just one revival in tonight's news, stay tuned for the rest, starting right now

00:24.900 --> 00:28.000
on the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:28.000 --> 00:35.880
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show

00:35.880 --> 00:37.600
where every gamer has a voice.

00:37.600 --> 00:44.600
It is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight with episode number 793, whoops at that title,

00:44.600 --> 00:48.560
for September the 22nd of 2019.

00:48.560 --> 00:52.900
My name is Rob Roberts and I'm going to fix away at this title here that's incorrect on

00:52.900 --> 00:58.260
our Twitch TV stream, because we do tape live, errors and all, every Sunday night at

00:58.260 --> 01:02.380
the Voice of Geeks Network, Twitch TV slash VOG Network.

01:02.380 --> 01:06.020
And while I'm fixing away that title, say hello to Techmaster Loki.

01:06.020 --> 01:07.020
Hello.

01:07.020 --> 01:08.020
How are you, Loki?

01:08.020 --> 01:09.020
I'm fine.

01:09.020 --> 01:10.020
Good.

01:10.020 --> 01:14.040
Me too, except for the little broken chat there, or sorry, the broken title and then

01:14.040 --> 01:17.040
my broken chat over here as well.

01:17.040 --> 01:20.920
So Twitch started doing this thing where you can do community gifting, which is really

01:20.920 --> 01:21.920
cool.

01:21.940 --> 01:25.300
It's like, if you're a Twitch Prime person, you can throw items into this chest and people

01:25.300 --> 01:30.180
are doing that right now in our chat room and at some point later during the show, around

01:30.180 --> 01:33.380
the time we take a break, what we'll do is we're going to open the chest and all the

01:33.380 --> 01:36.840
non Twitch Prime people, it'll give it away at random.

01:36.840 --> 01:39.660
So because Twitch Prime people already have it, so it's like you're putting your extra

01:39.660 --> 01:40.660
copies or whatever.

01:40.660 --> 01:41.660
I don't know.

01:41.660 --> 01:42.660
It gives you three codes to get away.

01:42.660 --> 01:45.580
You put it in this treasure chest and then we get to dole out all that loot to all the

01:45.580 --> 01:47.820
non Twitch Prime subscribers in chat.

01:47.820 --> 01:48.820
So it's fun.

01:48.840 --> 01:52.960
The problem is it kind of breaks the chat room on my side because it keeps hounding

01:52.960 --> 01:55.680
me like, donate more, put more in the chest.

01:55.680 --> 01:56.680
I'm like, okay.

01:56.680 --> 01:57.680
Do it.

01:57.680 --> 02:00.280
And it's, I'm happy to do that, but it's just like, Oh my God.

02:00.280 --> 02:02.920
Then it like breaks the little chat sidebar.

02:02.920 --> 02:06.300
So now I have to reopen it, but whatever.

02:06.300 --> 02:07.300
I'll deal with it.

02:07.300 --> 02:09.360
I will get around to your chat comments here very soon.

02:09.360 --> 02:11.760
As soon as I can actually read it.

02:11.760 --> 02:13.400
In the meantime, how was your week, Loki?

02:13.400 --> 02:14.760
How have you been?

02:14.760 --> 02:15.760
It's been okay.

02:15.780 --> 02:19.580
I didn't do a whole lot this week.

02:19.580 --> 02:21.820
I did play some more laser tag though.

02:21.820 --> 02:27.420
We went yesterday and I'm just kind of like, I was going to take the kids out cause my

02:27.420 --> 02:30.340
wife is going out with some friends to eat.

02:30.340 --> 02:34.580
And so I took the kids out to go eat and then we had like, it was around seven o'clock.

02:34.580 --> 02:39.560
We can squeeze in a game of laser tag before they have to go to bed, I guess.

02:39.560 --> 02:43.500
So we squeezed in a game of laser tag and it was just the three of us.

02:43.500 --> 02:49.500
And then like, as we were leaving, then there's like, Oh, all these other people want to play

02:49.500 --> 02:52.360
and it's like, okay, let's play with them.

02:52.360 --> 02:58.980
And then it was just like a ton of people and we just just destroyed them.

02:58.980 --> 03:02.400
Like it was just, well, there's actually people going there now.

03:02.400 --> 03:03.400
You said a ton of people.

03:03.400 --> 03:05.600
Well, yeah, it ended up working out.

03:05.600 --> 03:10.120
I think it was just a fluke, but like, yeah, there's like at least like 15, 20 people in

03:10.120 --> 03:13.220
the game and I, we just destroyed them.

03:13.220 --> 03:17.880
And when I say we, I mean myself and my kids, cause my kids are actually doing all right.

03:17.880 --> 03:20.560
Like they know how to like tag people and stuff.

03:20.560 --> 03:23.720
And my one youngest son likes flanking people.

03:23.720 --> 03:26.440
Some dads will go out there and throw the baseball with their kids.

03:26.440 --> 03:29.480
You teach people, you teach your kids how to annihilate others at laser tag.

03:29.480 --> 03:30.480
Yes.

03:30.480 --> 03:31.480
Fun.

03:31.480 --> 03:32.480
Yes.

03:32.480 --> 03:33.480
I like that.

03:33.480 --> 03:36.200
Anyhow, since I was, I was distracted by broken title and distracted by broken chat room,

03:36.200 --> 03:40.400
I forgot to address, hello, where's dark Sakura or Jamie Summers.

03:40.400 --> 03:42.160
She's not here tonight.

03:42.160 --> 03:43.200
She's a little under the weather.

03:43.200 --> 03:45.100
She's she's got a voice thing going on.

03:45.100 --> 03:49.780
So because she has to talk for her job, she felt it would be best to take the night off

03:49.780 --> 03:50.780
and rest her voice.

03:50.780 --> 03:53.940
And we can certainly understand that work is very important.

03:53.940 --> 03:56.080
So work is work is the most important thing.

03:56.080 --> 03:59.300
In fact, I just found out, well, I mean, it's a good thing.

03:59.300 --> 04:02.740
I'm going to be traveling for work and I love to do the travel thing, but we're not going

04:02.740 --> 04:05.420
to have a show towards the end of October because of it.

04:05.420 --> 04:10.020
So work comes first sometimes y'all and that's where a dark soccer is taken care of herself.

04:10.020 --> 04:11.020
So she can be ready for work.

04:11.020 --> 04:12.160
So she's not here tonight.

04:12.160 --> 04:14.020
She may pop into chat though.

04:14.020 --> 04:15.020
I see slag kick.

04:15.020 --> 04:16.020
Hello.

04:16.020 --> 04:17.640
Isn't our chat room saying heart for dark soccer.

04:17.640 --> 04:21.300
If she's here in chat, she has been known to pop into the chat room sometimes when she's

04:21.300 --> 04:24.660
not here, but she also may be using this time to catch up on errands.

04:24.660 --> 04:26.780
I don't know, but for whatever reason, she's not, or I'm sorry.

04:26.780 --> 04:32.300
We know the reason, but whether she's here in chat or I'm not, God, now I've got, look

04:32.300 --> 04:33.300
at this, look at this.

04:33.300 --> 04:37.100
Now my phone's popping up telemarketer or you can't see that on the thing.

04:37.100 --> 04:39.640
Telemarketer is calling me my God.

04:39.640 --> 04:41.100
Can anything.

04:41.120 --> 04:42.840
That's the worst name for a company.

04:42.840 --> 04:43.840
I know, right?

04:43.840 --> 04:47.120
No, it actually, did you know that the phones show that to you now it'll say like telemarketer

04:47.120 --> 04:52.520
or potential spam or yeah, it'll actually show you when, uh, it's, it's suspects.

04:52.520 --> 04:55.280
It's kind of a bullshit call or something going on.

04:55.280 --> 04:58.800
So yeah, anyway, let's talk about video games.

04:58.800 --> 05:00.840
My God, get this show on track people.

05:00.840 --> 05:02.760
It's been a great week for games.

05:02.760 --> 05:06.520
We've had a lot of big games that came out this week, namely, uh, links awakening on

05:06.520 --> 05:07.520
the switch.

05:07.520 --> 05:10.740
A lot of people are playing that game and having a blast with that game.

05:10.740 --> 05:13.100
Um, I, I actually was playing that game quite a bit.

05:13.100 --> 05:14.860
I'll talk a little more about it in my gaming week.

05:14.860 --> 05:16.300
Have you, have you checked out links awakening?

05:16.300 --> 05:19.220
I just picked it up, but I haven't played it yet.

05:19.220 --> 05:22.940
My kids had played it or my son's played it, but he doesn't understand what to do in that.

05:22.940 --> 05:26.700
So his game right now is I'm collecting rupees.

05:26.700 --> 05:27.980
That's all I'm doing is collecting rupees.

05:27.980 --> 05:28.980
Not a bad thing.

05:28.980 --> 05:29.980
Having money is good.

05:29.980 --> 05:30.980
It'll lie to buy.

05:30.980 --> 05:31.980
That's all he's doing.

05:31.980 --> 05:34.060
He's like, I'm like, well, you can have your brother help you with reading and stuff.

05:34.060 --> 05:35.700
He's like, well, I don't do the readings.

05:35.700 --> 05:39.920
So I'm just going to cut the, that's me playing games too.

05:39.920 --> 05:41.560
I don't read.

05:41.560 --> 05:43.120
So I'm like, okay, well that's cool.

05:43.120 --> 05:44.800
You know, you can do whatever you want in the game.

05:44.800 --> 05:45.800
That's fine.

05:45.800 --> 05:47.960
I'm like, why don't you play the untitled goose game instead?

05:47.960 --> 05:50.600
So um, another big game that came out this week.

05:50.600 --> 05:53.960
So I picked that up and I think they were playing that too.

05:53.960 --> 05:54.960
And he had fun.

05:54.960 --> 05:58.920
I'm trying to create a picnic cause I know that's one of the, uh, goals you have to do

05:58.920 --> 05:59.920
in the game.

05:59.920 --> 06:00.920
All right.

06:00.920 --> 06:02.480
Well, I won't get too ahead of ourselves and get into our gaming weeks.

06:02.480 --> 06:06.340
Let's get into our kickoff topic though, uh, which is a pretty big, uh, international

06:06.340 --> 06:07.340
story, I suppose.

06:07.340 --> 06:10.780
But this is one of those things that you kind of wonder how could this trickle down and

06:10.780 --> 06:12.720
affect other places.

06:12.720 --> 06:13.720
So Loki.

06:13.720 --> 06:14.720
Yeah.

06:14.720 --> 06:22.060
So apparently valve in 2015 was sued by an organization in France called, uh, UFC, Q,

06:22.060 --> 06:27.180
uh, I can't even pronounce what it was, but, uh, French legal words.

06:27.180 --> 06:28.180
Yes.

06:28.180 --> 06:30.700
So it's, um, some organization there.

06:30.720 --> 06:38.640
And basically, uh, they were saying that, uh, out of this, the ruling stated that, well,

06:38.640 --> 06:39.640
basically this backup.

06:39.640 --> 06:45.720
So valve was saying that they were basically selling like a service for these games.

06:45.720 --> 06:52.320
It was like a subscription to them versus, um, you know, actually owning copies of the

06:52.320 --> 06:53.320
games.

06:53.320 --> 06:59.800
Well, apparently the court decided that, no, they're not selling a subscription service.

06:59.800 --> 07:05.380
That's not compelling argument and users should be allowed to resell games.

07:05.380 --> 07:08.740
Um, so that is what's happening there.

07:08.740 --> 07:15.180
So apparently now in France, valve has to allow users to resell their games.

07:15.180 --> 07:19.620
Now this, you know, the, the resale of digital games, I think is something that, you know,

07:19.620 --> 07:23.020
a lot of us now, obviously, again, this is happening in France.

07:23.020 --> 07:27.020
This is a French court decision and you know, just because it happened there doesn't mean

07:27.020 --> 07:32.280
it's something that's going to happen in the US or Canada or Mexico or Japan or wherever

07:32.280 --> 07:34.660
our listeners are that happened to be listening to this show.

07:34.660 --> 07:39.920
But sometimes where one place goes, other places tend to follow.

07:39.920 --> 07:43.080
And I think, you know, many of us that have been playing digital games, I mean, how many

07:43.080 --> 07:45.120
of y'all out there buy digital games?

07:45.120 --> 07:47.800
And I'm sure many hands in the room just went up, right?

07:47.800 --> 07:53.100
And many of you are buying digital games probably for that convenience, digital games, uh, sometimes

07:53.100 --> 07:57.000
because these games go on like deep discount sales and they're pretty hard to resist, right?

07:57.000 --> 07:58.880
Like the, uh, humble bundles, right?

07:58.880 --> 07:59.880
That's all digital sales.

07:59.880 --> 08:00.880
Right.

08:00.880 --> 08:05.120
So, um, you know, y'all have probably bought a digital game or two in your day or hell

08:05.120 --> 08:11.720
if you've ever gotten one of the free games on Epic store, Epic game store, right, then

08:11.720 --> 08:15.160
that is a digital transaction, even though it's like free or whatever, uh, PlayStation

08:15.160 --> 08:21.020
plus X-Box games of gold and all this you're getting, you're participating in the digital

08:21.020 --> 08:24.920
distribution of games, which as we know is getting bigger and bigger in our industry.

08:24.920 --> 08:27.060
It's getting so big in this industry.

08:27.060 --> 08:31.360
We just had a story on last week's show about the GameStop struggling because the industry

08:31.360 --> 08:32.360
has changed.

08:32.360 --> 08:37.120
GameStop's having to compete with the local GameStop here and they've actually remodeled

08:37.120 --> 08:38.120
quite a bit.

08:38.120 --> 08:41.480
Um, you see a lot of that pot, they have a whole section that, well, they've always had

08:41.480 --> 08:45.000
a section for pop figs, but now it's more prominent by the door.

08:45.000 --> 08:49.160
Um, and this doesn't necessarily mean that things are going to change because they still

08:49.160 --> 08:50.520
have an appeal.

08:50.520 --> 08:56.640
Um, also the judge ruled that, um, they have to comply within a month's time.

08:56.640 --> 09:02.160
If they don't, then they'll have to pay a fine of 3000 euros per day, up to six months.

09:02.160 --> 09:03.480
They may just take the fine.

09:03.480 --> 09:06.260
If you think about it, wow.

09:06.260 --> 09:10.320
So they could probably, if they feel that they're going to lose more money after all,

09:10.320 --> 09:13.800
they could just, there's going to be a meeting at valve headquarters up there in Washington

09:13.800 --> 09:14.800
on Monday.

09:14.800 --> 09:19.160
There's going to be a big meet and Gabe Newell's going to be in that meeting because something's

09:19.160 --> 09:20.440
going to have to happen here.

09:20.440 --> 09:21.440
You're right.

09:21.440 --> 09:22.440
Either.

09:22.440 --> 09:23.440
They're just going to suck it up and take the fine.

09:23.440 --> 09:27.320
Uh, do you, do you think there's a possibility steam pulls out of France?

09:27.320 --> 09:29.120
Steam says, you know what, fuck it.

09:29.120 --> 09:30.120
I'm out.

09:30.120 --> 09:31.120
They could.

09:31.120 --> 09:35.400
I mean, if the, if the amount of money that they're making from that territory isn't worth

09:35.400 --> 09:41.800
it, then they could just easily block people in France from using the service.

09:41.800 --> 09:42.800
Wow.

09:42.800 --> 09:47.960
So, and, and so we may see that's interesting because if steam does pull out of France and

09:47.960 --> 09:51.720
I know this is a very like pie in the sky type of thing, I imagine there will be appeals

09:51.720 --> 09:55.360
and all that stuff, but I don't, I don't know if the French courts work like the courts

09:55.360 --> 09:58.760
here because I think, Oh, when a judgment comes out in America, it'll be tied up in

09:58.760 --> 10:00.720
appeals courts for years to come.

10:00.720 --> 10:05.200
But this is a very like defined, you start this in 30 days or you're getting paid, you're

10:05.200 --> 10:06.360
going to be paying a fine.

10:06.360 --> 10:09.840
That seems pretty definitive as opposed to what I might hear if this were coming out

10:09.840 --> 10:11.920
at an, uh, out of an American court.

10:11.920 --> 10:12.920
Right?

10:12.920 --> 10:13.920
Yeah.

10:13.920 --> 10:14.920
Yeah.

10:14.920 --> 10:15.920
Our court system is notorious for being slow as hell.

10:15.920 --> 10:16.920
Right.

10:17.880 --> 10:18.880
Anyway.

10:18.880 --> 10:19.880
Yeah.

10:19.880 --> 10:22.880
I mean, it's, it's possible that they just pull out of France altogether or, you know,

10:22.880 --> 10:24.240
maybe they'll move forward with it.

10:24.240 --> 10:25.240
Who knows?

10:25.240 --> 10:27.520
But it was, Oh, I was going to say, we might get to see you.

10:27.520 --> 10:30.720
You remember how Gabe has this big red button on his desk.

10:30.720 --> 10:31.720
Okay.

10:31.720 --> 10:35.240
I'm kind of making this up, but in theory, he has a big red button on his desk.

10:35.240 --> 10:40.960
And if steam ever goes down or is like closed and shuts down, that button gets pushed and

10:40.960 --> 10:42.120
what happens?

10:42.120 --> 10:48.420
That means the DRM it's gone and you will get access to your games without needing steam.

10:48.420 --> 10:54.120
We may, we may be 30 days from seeing that button get pushed in France.

10:54.120 --> 10:59.700
I doubt that, but it's interesting to see them argue the game licenses because you know,

10:59.700 --> 11:02.840
with most software nowadays, you don't own the software.

11:02.840 --> 11:07.360
You're just licensing, licensing, licensing it from the company.

11:07.360 --> 11:12.040
And so that's why they're saying, Oh, resale's not really allowed there because it's a digital

11:12.040 --> 11:13.040
license.

11:13.040 --> 11:18.400
But the argument that they made there with the court was that word, just digital subscription

11:18.400 --> 11:25.120
service, meaning that think of it like Netflix, where I pay $10 a month and I get access to

11:25.120 --> 11:26.120
all these titles.

11:26.120 --> 11:30.760
Whereas this is more like paying money and getting access to the title.

11:30.760 --> 11:32.160
That's why I didn't end up flying.

11:32.160 --> 11:36.720
You might be able to say that if your PlayStation network or Xbox games with gold or even game

11:36.720 --> 11:39.040
pass, I think something like that might be fine.

11:39.040 --> 11:44.320
I think if it was one of them on trial, they could probably get away with that, but valve,

11:44.320 --> 11:48.320
not so much, which by the way, would be the exact same setup as Google stadia.

11:48.320 --> 11:49.320
Right?

11:49.320 --> 11:52.680
I mean, I realized there's a difference here because steam is a store.

11:52.680 --> 11:53.680
Google is going to be streaming.

11:53.680 --> 11:57.040
It's, it's like a way to play the game, but Google will be selling you.

11:57.040 --> 12:03.300
It's not, and Google has even said on the record, this is not the Netflix model, right?

12:03.300 --> 12:05.760
So what happens here could affect Google stadia.

12:05.760 --> 12:07.680
Google's probably watching what's happening in France.

12:07.680 --> 12:11.360
Google's I still don't know how Google stadia is going to work.

12:11.360 --> 12:15.640
Hey, you pay us $10 a month for like 4k or whatever it is.

12:15.640 --> 12:16.640
And you get nothing with that.

12:16.640 --> 12:17.640
All right.

12:17.640 --> 12:20.760
I'm going to turn this car around before it turns into a Google thing.

12:20.760 --> 12:24.880
Cause this really is about the valve and this, this whole thing going on.

12:24.880 --> 12:30.080
So you know what, okay, let me, let me say this too, because I bet a lot of the listeners

12:30.080 --> 12:34.720
and a lot of, you know, and even there's that part of me that goes, well, Hey, it's about

12:34.720 --> 12:35.720
time.

12:35.720 --> 12:39.080
The other thing that's been a limitation to me buying games digitally is that they have

12:39.080 --> 12:40.400
no equity, right?

12:40.400 --> 12:45.400
They have no, no value once you have them in your library, because you cannot turn around

12:45.400 --> 12:46.640
and resell them.

12:46.640 --> 12:51.000
Whereas I'm sure many of you grew up in an era where when you were done with your Nintendo

12:51.000 --> 12:55.880
game or your super Nintendo game or your PlayStation PS two game, depending on how old you are,

12:55.880 --> 12:59.240
you could take that game, sell it to somebody else.

12:59.240 --> 13:04.800
I remember going onto a BBS and selling my NES cartridges to another person.

13:04.800 --> 13:07.320
And obviously this is the whole thing behind GameStop, right?

13:07.320 --> 13:08.800
The sale of used games.

13:08.800 --> 13:14.800
Well, now if what happens in France, you know, is goes through and really happens, then you're

13:14.800 --> 13:17.440
going to have all these digital games that have equity.

13:17.440 --> 13:22.220
And I think most people are probably cheering or celebrating that because it's yay, my games

13:22.220 --> 13:23.220
have value.

13:23.220 --> 13:28.880
Well, the problem is, so it doesn't really hurt the platform holder too much because

13:28.880 --> 13:32.680
yeah, I'm sure that they would be totally fine with selling used games.

13:33.200 --> 13:40.240
Let's just say we go the model with the Steam items that they have, whether it be Counter

13:40.240 --> 13:45.320
Strike stuff or it could be, you know, card packs or whatever.

13:45.320 --> 13:49.360
They take a portion of that profit every time there's a sale.

13:49.360 --> 13:52.520
And you could say, oh, well, we could give some of that to the developer as well.

13:52.520 --> 13:57.160
But in the end, it ends up hurting the developer because, you know, I could buy this indie

13:57.160 --> 14:02.200
game for $14.99 or I could pay whatever the use price is for it.

14:02.720 --> 14:07.320
Well, Counterpoint, haven't we gone down this road before when the used game market first

14:07.320 --> 14:10.600
started to show itself or held the video game rental market?

14:10.600 --> 14:12.540
Didn't Nintendo hate that shit?

14:12.540 --> 14:15.640
Like isn't that why there was a code with StarTropics?

14:15.640 --> 14:20.160
Like Nintendo actually designed a game where you could not get past the halfway point or

14:20.160 --> 14:21.720
wherever it was, two thirds point.

14:21.720 --> 14:24.880
You could not get past that point without a secret letter that you dip in water.

14:24.880 --> 14:27.400
Now, look, we all know that code is everywhere now.

14:27.400 --> 14:29.080
It's 747, right?

14:29.080 --> 14:31.340
You should know that code by now.

14:31.340 --> 14:36.140
But the reality is Nintendo did that to try to fight the rental market and some of that

14:36.140 --> 14:37.140
stuff.

14:37.140 --> 14:40.380
I mean, it wasn't the most brilliant plan in the world, but they did take a page out

14:40.380 --> 14:43.100
of Computer Gaming's book, right?

14:43.100 --> 14:49.020
Remember when this software is copy protected, turn to page 34 in the manual and match the

14:49.020 --> 14:51.540
design with, right?

14:51.540 --> 14:55.860
That was all the combat used gaming and rental gaming and all that shit, right?

14:55.860 --> 15:01.700
So one could argue we've been down this road before, the industry sided with the gamer

15:01.700 --> 15:04.780
and having equity in the game, we weren't ruined.

15:04.780 --> 15:06.260
So what makes this different now?

15:06.260 --> 15:12.060
Well, it's because indie game, I think it's because the indie game development, you have

15:12.060 --> 15:17.180
a lot of, there's like hundreds of developers out there just putting out these products,

15:17.180 --> 15:20.260
making barely any money off of the software.

15:20.260 --> 15:23.740
And now you're saying, oh boy, you're gonna make even less off of it now.

15:23.740 --> 15:27.120
So it's kind of about like the indie game specifically, because now we live in an era,

15:27.120 --> 15:31.840
you know, when we were talking to Star Tropics, NES cartridge era, every game was 50 bucks.

15:31.840 --> 15:35.980
You know, maybe 40, maybe if you found a sale, it would be a little cheaper.

15:35.980 --> 15:36.980
Every game was expensive.

15:36.980 --> 15:39.920
And I get it, like there's the same amount of copies out there still.

15:39.920 --> 15:45.420
So like, if you're, I remember the use game argument was, well, you know, back when they

15:45.420 --> 15:49.340
were selling the online pass, you know, oh, well, if you buy a used copy of the buy an

15:49.340 --> 15:53.660
online pass because we have to keep our servers running and shit like that, which didn't make

15:53.660 --> 15:58.340
any sense because they already made that money the first time when they sold it originally.

15:58.340 --> 16:00.800
But now this is a digital copy.

16:00.800 --> 16:02.700
And I guess you could make the same argument for that.

16:02.700 --> 16:06.580
But a lot of these indie studios, I don't think are necessarily charging like they don't

16:06.580 --> 16:11.220
have that same model where they're charging you for an online pass or something like that.

16:11.220 --> 16:15.500
So it would end up hurting these studios a lot more because they're making less money

16:15.500 --> 16:16.500
off of it.

16:16.500 --> 16:20.500
And plus, you know, that's a problem already with like keys getting leaked out there and

16:20.500 --> 16:23.100
being sold by like G2A and stuff like that.

16:23.540 --> 16:24.540
What's this going to happen?

16:24.540 --> 16:28.180
You know, we get like key farmers coming in, buying shit like really cheap and then selling

16:28.180 --> 16:32.680
stuff really cheap, you know, tanking the market on something.

16:32.680 --> 16:37.060
Or you could even like, you know, play it like, I don't know if you'd be able to purchase

16:37.060 --> 16:41.900
multiple copies of stuff, but like, you know, you take the market with one thing and you

16:41.900 --> 16:44.700
purchase all those copies up and then wait for the value to go back out.

16:44.700 --> 16:49.040
And I don't know, it's just, I want to open this up to chat and your guys's thoughts.

16:49.040 --> 16:54.320
Do you guys think that digital resale of games, which we're about 30 days away from likely

16:54.320 --> 16:59.000
seeing in France, do you think this is a good thing for the industry or a bad thing from

16:59.000 --> 17:00.000
the industry?

17:00.000 --> 17:02.920
And, you know, let's respect all the voices out there because I know this is probably

17:02.920 --> 17:05.560
a contentious topic because we're talking about money.

17:05.560 --> 17:08.320
But I think in many ways, this is uncharted territory.

17:08.320 --> 17:10.720
So we don't know if it's a good thing or a bad thing yet.

17:10.720 --> 17:11.720
I mean, yeah.

17:11.720 --> 17:15.960
I mean, there's that part of me that instinctively goes, oh, yay, that's free money for me.

17:15.960 --> 17:17.560
So I think, oh, it's a good thing.

17:17.560 --> 17:21.560
But then I definitely kind of pull back and I think, ah, shit, like things like Humble

17:21.560 --> 17:27.360
Bundle probably wouldn't exist if those games held some sort of value in them.

17:27.360 --> 17:32.380
But of course, you know, I don't know, like how much value do certain games really have?

17:32.380 --> 17:36.680
I know that sounds like a really shitty thing to say, but I think the reality is too, is

17:36.680 --> 17:41.360
that, okay, like, look, like here, the local chain Dimple Records just finally went under,

17:41.360 --> 17:42.360
right?

17:42.360 --> 17:45.460
I think they had like their last sale last week and Dimple Records was this local place

17:45.460 --> 17:51.340
here in Sacramento where our show is based, where you could buy like DVDs and CDs and

17:51.340 --> 17:52.340
things like that.

17:52.340 --> 17:53.340
Vinyl, yeah.

17:53.340 --> 17:58.400
Well, if you went in this last week to go look at the Slim Pickens, you got to go see

17:58.400 --> 18:05.380
like those 25 cent DVDs where it's like Jillian from The Biggest Loser's Workout Tape number

18:05.380 --> 18:09.940
12 on, you know, like it's the, it's that, right?

18:09.940 --> 18:14.140
You know, and I think the reality is there are some games out there and I know this sounds

18:14.140 --> 18:17.900
terrible, but there are some games out there that are the Jillian Michaels Workout Tape

18:17.900 --> 18:24.420
number 12 of the gaming industry because, and I think some of them have done it to themselves.

18:24.420 --> 18:28.220
Like I would say one of those games, ooh, now I'm going to get real nasty already.

18:28.220 --> 18:29.220
I'm going to name names.

18:29.220 --> 18:31.260
I'm gonna say one of those games is Fez.

18:31.260 --> 18:34.340
Why do I, why do I say Fez is one of those games?

18:34.340 --> 18:37.520
Because it's, I have like eight copies of it from all the Humble Bundles.

18:37.520 --> 18:45.260
Because every time there's some giveaway on some platform, Fez has been there, right?

18:45.260 --> 18:51.740
So I kind of think in that regard, like, well, how much is a copy of Fez really worth?

18:51.740 --> 18:55.960
And I know that is a shitty thing to say, because Fez, your opinions on indie game,

18:55.960 --> 19:01.540
the movie aside, Fez is a good game, you know, it should be, but like, it's so saturated

19:01.540 --> 19:02.540
at this point.

19:02.540 --> 19:05.640
It's like, who fucking doesn't have Fez at this point?

19:05.640 --> 19:08.980
Like you've made a conscious decision, you don't want to play that game if you haven't

19:08.980 --> 19:10.120
played it at this point.

19:10.120 --> 19:12.300
I haven't played it yet.

19:12.300 --> 19:16.420
It's not that I don't want to, it's just, it's, it's in the backlog of all the other

19:16.420 --> 19:17.420
games.

19:17.420 --> 19:18.420
All right.

19:18.420 --> 19:19.880
Let's get into some of the comments in chat.

19:19.880 --> 19:23.620
So Bobby talking about the online pass thing, saying a system administrators don't work

19:23.620 --> 19:24.620
for free.

19:24.620 --> 19:28.260
The idea was that the $60 price paid for the game developers who made the game and the

19:28.260 --> 19:32.240
online pass paid for the separate people who were the system administrators who maintain

19:32.240 --> 19:33.240
the game.

19:33.240 --> 19:36.760
It made perfect sense.

19:36.760 --> 19:38.880
It just wasn't a popular model.

19:38.880 --> 19:42.160
Well, one could, I already know what Bobby's comment to that is going to be because it

19:42.160 --> 19:44.240
would depend on who is hosting those servers.

19:44.240 --> 19:47.360
Whereas on PC, there isn't exactly a front end to that.

19:47.360 --> 19:49.720
I'm going to just, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

19:49.720 --> 19:50.720
Let's not do that.

19:50.720 --> 19:54.240
What about all the billions of dollars they're making for microtransactions?

19:54.240 --> 19:58.120
Can't that pay for servers, but they need the extra $5 on top of all of that.

19:58.120 --> 19:59.120
To be fair.

19:59.120 --> 20:00.120
That is the point I was going to make.

20:00.120 --> 20:01.840
I was just going to say it a little differently.

20:01.840 --> 20:03.560
It wasn't snarky enough.

20:03.560 --> 20:04.840
All right.

20:04.840 --> 20:06.400
Uh, let's see.

20:06.400 --> 20:11.080
Bobby does also say AAA games should actually cost way more than $60 because of inflation

20:11.080 --> 20:13.920
of both the worth and the size of development teams.

20:13.920 --> 20:16.620
Well, honestly, I'm actually going to say, I agree.

20:16.620 --> 20:19.700
And I've been saying that for a while here on this show is that instead of doing these

20:19.700 --> 20:24.160
online pass, nickel diming, loot boxes, just fucking suck it up and charge 70 bucks for

20:24.160 --> 20:25.160
the game already.

20:25.160 --> 20:27.840
Just, you know, I know that's not going to be popular.

20:27.840 --> 20:28.840
Yes.

20:28.840 --> 20:30.320
People are going to bellyache about it, but you know what?

20:30.320 --> 20:31.320
Just fucking charge it.

20:31.320 --> 20:32.320
They already do.

20:32.320 --> 20:33.880
They plan out the DLC.

20:33.880 --> 20:38.220
That's why they have this whole, you know, season pass crap that you're buying.

20:38.220 --> 20:43.400
They split it off purposefully so that they do charge you more money because splitting

20:43.400 --> 20:48.760
it up saying, Oh, well you're paying $60 here and then you pay for an online pass.

20:48.760 --> 20:52.520
People can say, Oh, well it feels like it's an option, you know, but a lot of that content

20:52.520 --> 20:57.280
that was in there originally in a lot of these games, they're purposely taking out and putting

20:57.280 --> 21:01.960
in like online pass stuff or not online pass in the season passes.

21:01.960 --> 21:06.040
They're at, they're taking the content out of the original game and piece mailing it

21:06.040 --> 21:07.040
to you.

21:07.040 --> 21:08.040
All right.

21:08.040 --> 21:11.560
Getting into some of the comments about what do you think about this change or, you know,

21:11.560 --> 21:15.600
I keep saying it's a change, but I guess still it's a potential change because you still

21:15.600 --> 21:17.320
don't know how the chess pieces are going to move.

21:17.320 --> 21:21.460
We don't know if steam's going to react that, but, uh, your reactions in chat fifth dream

21:21.460 --> 21:26.080
today says, I think I can't wrap my head around it because a copy of a digital code is just

21:26.080 --> 21:27.080
that.

21:27.080 --> 21:29.480
Which costs a fraction of a set to transmit.

21:29.480 --> 21:30.480
I agree.

21:30.480 --> 21:34.800
The original sale has value to pay for labor to create it, but after that, I don't know.

21:34.800 --> 21:38.480
She hold 10 says physical should cost more than digital.

21:38.480 --> 21:42.040
Other than that, anything goes as far as reselling what you own.

21:42.040 --> 21:43.400
Is that interesting though?

21:43.400 --> 21:47.960
Like things are coming full circle in a way and that we have this whole limited run games

21:47.960 --> 21:48.960
thing, right?

21:48.960 --> 21:49.960
Yeah.

21:49.960 --> 21:54.400
Limited run games is taking a lot of these digital games and creating these light collectibles,

21:54.400 --> 21:59.200
collector's editions, and like really enhanced, cool things that sell out within seconds.

21:59.200 --> 22:03.340
And they do cost a little bit of money, but I think some people like, that's really cool.

22:03.340 --> 22:06.380
That's all the GameStop is nowadays is collectible things.

22:06.380 --> 22:08.060
That's what they have in their story.

22:08.060 --> 22:09.520
It's it's collectibles.

22:09.520 --> 22:15.480
I mean, they have their games, they sell the used games, but it's mostly collectibles is

22:15.480 --> 22:21.600
like a third, if not half of the store Questbuster in chat with another comment here saying everything's

22:21.600 --> 22:23.520
going to games as a service now.

22:23.520 --> 22:27.360
And one of the reasons is to keep devs employed instead of losing heads at the end of every

22:27.360 --> 22:30.580
project, but also to keep players engaged.

22:30.580 --> 22:32.840
Not everyone does games as a service well though.

22:32.840 --> 22:36.960
Oh, what a good point because look at what's happening with Anthem right now.

22:36.960 --> 22:37.960
Yikes.

22:37.960 --> 22:42.120
Versus what's happening with Blizzard and Overwatch still going strong years after the

22:42.120 --> 22:43.480
release of the game, right?

22:43.480 --> 22:46.360
Now they've got the Switch version coming out, which, you know, people are going crazy

22:46.360 --> 22:47.360
about as well.

22:47.360 --> 22:51.640
So it just kind of depends on, I think the company in a big way and the game that they're

22:51.640 --> 22:53.500
doing for sure.

22:53.500 --> 22:56.800
Also I want to point out, cause I thought this was really funny, Slag Kick actually

22:56.800 --> 23:02.820
linked us to a copy of, from the year 2009, Jillian Michaels Fitness Ultimatum, which

23:02.820 --> 23:07.740
was a game on the Nintendo Wii, and saying Jillian Michaels Fitness Ultimatum is the

23:07.740 --> 23:12.380
Jillian Michaels volume 12 of video games.

23:12.380 --> 23:17.140
If we did name episodes of OLR, I feel like the title of tonight's show would be in there

23:17.140 --> 23:18.140
somewhere.

23:18.140 --> 23:20.140
It would be Fitness Ultimatum.

23:20.140 --> 23:25.140
Michael Pacas in chat says, I forgot Anthem existed.

23:25.140 --> 23:31.220
The power that that has, the influence that that has, the international implications that

23:31.220 --> 23:32.220
has.

23:32.220 --> 23:33.660
No, it's like, it's what a true statement.

23:33.660 --> 23:36.260
Like y'all remember Anthem?

23:36.260 --> 23:42.900
Let's do a retro throw, but the classic game of the week this week is Anthem.

23:42.900 --> 23:45.260
Remember when people were really excited about Anthem?

23:45.260 --> 23:48.540
Yeah, that's gonna be fun because in 10 years time you're not gonna be able to play that

23:48.540 --> 23:49.540
game.

23:49.940 --> 23:50.940
At all.

23:50.940 --> 23:54.380
It'll be just completely dead.

23:54.380 --> 23:57.020
Bobby does want to say a little more on what's going on.

23:57.020 --> 23:59.460
I am kind of cherry picking some comments here for time.

23:59.460 --> 24:03.540
But Bobby does say realize with, if you want to see all the comments, you got to go to

24:03.540 --> 24:08.540
our Twitch page over twitch.tv slash vog network, where we do tape live every Sunday night right

24:08.540 --> 24:12.660
after the Bobby Black Wolf show at six o'clock, seven, nine o'clock Eastern and chats do save

24:12.660 --> 24:13.660
for two weeks.

24:13.660 --> 24:17.780
They don't say forever, sadly, but they do save for two weeks.

24:17.820 --> 24:21.660
And you can, what does save forever is episodes of Orange Launch Radio.

24:21.660 --> 24:26.740
If you are a subscriber at vog network, you can watch endless episodes of Orange Launch

24:26.740 --> 24:31.340
Radio and the Bobby Black Wolf show and other vog network specials as they occur, hopefully

24:31.340 --> 24:33.700
more to happen in the future, but you get access to all that.

24:33.700 --> 24:39.100
And I plug all of that because it's September and this is actually the last night that you

24:39.100 --> 24:42.740
can actually get a half off subscription.

24:42.740 --> 24:46.180
So if you want, at least last Sunday night, I think the actual September promotion has

24:46.180 --> 24:50.980
a couple more days in it, however much longer September is, but September is tonight.

24:50.980 --> 24:54.140
So if you do want to subscribe, you want to do a half off, tonight's a great time to do

24:54.140 --> 24:55.140
that.

24:55.140 --> 24:58.580
Don't forget if you are Twitch, excuse me, an Amazon prime person, you get one free prime

24:58.580 --> 25:02.580
subscription and you can use that and then you're basically getting it for free, although

25:02.580 --> 25:05.000
you already paid through it for it through Amazon prime.

25:05.000 --> 25:07.380
So anyway, sorry, I had to make sure I get the little pitch.

25:07.380 --> 25:08.380
I would do it once.

25:08.380 --> 25:11.540
I don't like to sit here and beg all night long, but I had to make sure I get it out

25:11.540 --> 25:12.540
at some point.

25:12.540 --> 25:17.860
I'd be a bad broadcaster if I didn't at least try to try to course you to subscribe at least

25:17.860 --> 25:20.100
once throughout this three hour stream.

25:20.100 --> 25:21.100
Okay.

25:21.100 --> 25:24.940
Bobby does say, realize that with the digital code, there's also server space and bandwidth

25:24.940 --> 25:30.180
costs to transmit the game to you a little more than a fraction of a cent.

25:30.180 --> 25:34.440
And a lot of people do kind of write that off, but it is, for example, Steam has to

25:34.440 --> 25:40.500
run those servers to redeem keys and things like that, it ain't free.

25:40.500 --> 25:46.460
But yeah, we can also remember that most games that are $60 out there, the actual price

25:46.460 --> 25:51.380
that like, say your GameStop or whatever is paying is closer to $50.

25:51.380 --> 25:57.280
So there's that markup there, which they just pocket that when they are selling it digitally.

25:57.280 --> 26:01.280
Bobby Blackwell says, but nowadays, the vast majority of DLC doesn't get started until

26:01.280 --> 26:02.280
the game is out.

26:02.280 --> 26:07.360
Do you consider the extra Smash Brothers fighter fighters to have been ripped out of the game?

26:07.360 --> 26:09.020
I'm not saying every company does it.

26:09.420 --> 26:11.260
And I think that's an important point.

26:11.260 --> 26:15.580
This is company by company and which companies do we trust and which do we not?

26:15.580 --> 26:16.580
Let's put it this way.

26:16.580 --> 26:17.580
It's not necessarily...

26:17.580 --> 26:21.900
Okay, I'm trying to think of a good example of stuff that's been ripped out of games.

26:21.900 --> 26:23.460
A lot of it seems to be...

26:23.460 --> 26:26.060
Street Fighter 5 characters were on the disc.

26:26.060 --> 26:28.280
Well, yeah, there's that.

26:28.280 --> 26:31.660
The Oblivion horse armor, for God's sake.

26:31.660 --> 26:35.740
Go throw back to the classic DLC that was on the disc.

26:35.740 --> 26:37.840
The horse armor was just kind of stupid.

26:37.840 --> 26:42.300
It was just kind of a dumb example of like, hey, here's something we're selling for $5.

26:42.300 --> 26:44.360
You're an idiot if you buy it type of thing.

26:44.360 --> 26:47.880
Whereas then the rest of the DLC that they had for like the other Oblivion stuff was

26:47.880 --> 26:50.880
actually all right.

26:50.880 --> 26:56.000
But there is stuff though that is, especially when you're talking about games in a franchise

26:56.000 --> 27:00.500
where it's sequel to sequel, where there's features that they had before and they're

27:00.500 --> 27:05.000
taking them out and then selling them back to you later.

27:05.000 --> 27:07.120
There's stuff that's just been kind of like...

27:07.120 --> 27:17.640
Oh, for example, so in Madden NFL, okay, Madden NFL 19, I believe, they had like X number

27:17.640 --> 27:21.320
of faces that you could choose from for your characters.

27:21.320 --> 27:26.080
This year, they have those same faces, like literally the faces are exactly the same.

27:26.080 --> 27:28.120
They didn't remodel anything, they didn't do anything.

27:28.120 --> 27:32.280
This is for your player characters, but they actually have less of them and the additional

27:32.280 --> 27:37.680
faces that are offered that were in the last game, they're selling to you as DLC.

27:37.680 --> 27:40.380
You have to buy it to those faces.

27:40.380 --> 27:41.380
They're already made.

27:41.380 --> 27:44.600
It is the same fucking model, the same...

27:44.600 --> 27:45.600
They didn't change anything.

27:45.600 --> 27:51.480
It is exactly the same and they're selling you those pieces because EA is fucking shit.

27:51.480 --> 27:52.480
That's why.

27:52.480 --> 27:55.920
And actually it's funny because Bobby in chat says we're giving examples from many years

27:55.920 --> 27:56.920
ago.

27:56.920 --> 27:57.920
Do you have games that were released in the last two years?

27:57.920 --> 27:58.920
So funny enough there.

27:58.920 --> 27:59.920
Yes.

27:59.920 --> 28:00.920
And he just...

28:00.920 --> 28:01.920
Madden NFL.

28:02.560 --> 28:05.680
Actually, I was going to say, I would have said Star Wars Battlefront 2.

28:05.680 --> 28:10.120
I mean, it wasn't so much DLC, but it was that loot box shit, right?

28:10.120 --> 28:13.480
Like we all know that was like loot boxes, the new DLC, right?

28:13.480 --> 28:19.440
But regardless, what are these two games we just gave you have in common?

28:19.440 --> 28:20.440
It's EA.

28:20.440 --> 28:21.440
Yeah.

28:21.440 --> 28:22.440
Wow.

28:22.440 --> 28:27.080
And Anthem isn't doing too well because people all kind of knew that the game was...

28:27.080 --> 28:29.560
What does Anthem have in common with these games that we mentioned?

28:29.560 --> 28:30.560
EA.

28:30.700 --> 28:31.700
Let's not forget though.

28:31.700 --> 28:37.880
Let's not say it's just EA, 2K games also take two, Interactive also very bad about

28:37.880 --> 28:38.880
this stuff.

28:38.880 --> 28:41.040
And I say that as a fan of Grand Theft Auto.

28:41.040 --> 28:42.040
That's Rockstar Games.

28:42.040 --> 28:49.400
Rockstar Games is awesome, but holy shit is like the monetization really just like ridiculous.

28:49.400 --> 28:55.160
I don't play Grand Theft Auto online anymore, but it's gotten ridiculous is the amount of

28:55.160 --> 28:56.960
money because they smell the money.

28:56.960 --> 28:58.400
They know it's there.

28:58.400 --> 29:04.120
They're just going to try to monetize the show and same with like NBA 2K 20.

29:04.120 --> 29:09.440
That's all you hear about now is all of the monetization of loot boxes and actual gambling

29:09.440 --> 29:10.440
in the game.

29:10.440 --> 29:12.920
Like that's all that people are talking about.

29:12.920 --> 29:15.480
I am going to reign it back a bit because we've got to distance ourselves a little bit

29:15.480 --> 29:16.920
from the original topic.

29:16.920 --> 29:20.120
So let me kind of like to try to wrap this up, put a bow on it.

29:20.120 --> 29:22.560
Like what, where do we go from here?

29:22.560 --> 29:25.920
Do we think that, you know, there's an appeal that's going to happen?

29:25.920 --> 29:28.480
What's your prediction for what happens in the next 30 days?

29:28.480 --> 29:33.840
I think they're going to appeal and then we'll see another court case, another argument regarding

29:33.840 --> 29:34.840
it.

29:34.840 --> 29:37.260
And I think if they actually are forced to do it, then they'll probably just pay the

29:37.260 --> 29:42.260
fine and see, I don't know if the court will force them to do it after that six months,

29:42.260 --> 29:47.720
but I think the fine would be less than what they would have to pay with.

29:47.720 --> 29:50.240
I don't know if they would do that to the developers.

29:50.240 --> 29:53.860
And also with, with that, it's kind of weird.

29:53.860 --> 29:55.540
Why would it only be valve?

29:55.540 --> 30:04.780
It should be not only games, but movies, music, like anything that you're buying digital books,

30:04.780 --> 30:10.720
anything digitally that you're purchasing that all should fall under the same thing.

30:10.720 --> 30:16.140
So I would be, I would, whereas valve might not make a big stink about it.

30:16.140 --> 30:19.940
The RIAA will make a big fucking stink about it.

30:19.940 --> 30:23.020
And the movie industry will make a huge fucking stink about it.

30:23.020 --> 30:24.020
Interesting.

30:24.020 --> 30:27.980
Why would there be some type of alliance between steam and Hollywood based on what you're saying?

30:27.980 --> 30:33.220
Because it's, it's just a slippery slope because it, why would it only pertain to games?

30:33.220 --> 30:34.760
You know, it's the same model.

30:34.760 --> 30:38.720
You're purchasing a digital license for this product.

30:38.720 --> 30:42.640
So I would see that it's very much in a line.

30:42.640 --> 30:46.860
And so if they're probably closely watching what's going to happen here, because if it,

30:46.860 --> 30:51.660
if the court says, yeah, they have to be able to resell that stuff, then that would go the

30:51.660 --> 30:56.260
same for music and all this other stuff, which they're not going to want.

30:56.260 --> 30:57.260
All right.

30:57.260 --> 31:01.340
And, and who influences YouTube the most?

31:01.340 --> 31:03.540
It's the music industry and the movie industry.

31:03.540 --> 31:07.620
So obviously they have some pole when it comes to that kind of stuff.

31:07.620 --> 31:08.620
Okay.

31:08.620 --> 31:10.900
Um, interesting because I would have said, I actually think it's a really interesting

31:10.900 --> 31:14.220
point because I would have said, I bet steam just pulls out of France.

31:14.220 --> 31:16.660
I bet steam cuts their losses and just pulls out of France.

31:16.660 --> 31:20.820
But um, you know, sorry France, but I think you believe it or not.

31:20.820 --> 31:25.040
I think you bring up a great point because it doesn't end with seem like they can decide

31:25.040 --> 31:27.500
to do that, but there's going to be more.

31:27.500 --> 31:32.700
If Hollywood isn't watching what's happening here, they damn well ought to be because it

31:32.700 --> 31:36.800
could have, you know, especially because what Hollywood is making a shit ton of money off

31:36.800 --> 31:37.800
digital now too.

31:37.800 --> 31:42.060
I'm not just talking about things like Netflix and Hulu, but they release movies digital

31:42.060 --> 31:44.180
before they're out on Blu-ray, right?

31:44.180 --> 31:49.300
That's like a common trend now is to sell digital and why, why if I'm Hollywood, if

31:49.300 --> 31:53.520
I'm Paramount pictures, if I'm Sony pictures, classics, if I'm, if I'm any of these movie

31:53.520 --> 31:59.740
companies, why do I want to allow you to buy it digitally a week or two before it's out

31:59.740 --> 32:00.740
on Blu-ray?

32:00.740 --> 32:02.900
Why do I want you to do that?

32:02.900 --> 32:05.100
So you don't rent it from red box.

32:05.100 --> 32:06.940
And so I don't sell it back.

32:06.940 --> 32:08.580
And so I don't take it.

32:08.580 --> 32:10.260
I can't, I can't give it to a friend.

32:10.260 --> 32:11.260
I can't do anything.

32:11.260 --> 32:15.340
But like, honestly, like what is the used market for DVDs nowaday?

32:15.340 --> 32:20.140
I mean, like, aside from, I guess, selling on like eBay or Amazon or something like that,

32:20.140 --> 32:25.940
I mean, locally, like places that do like buy, sell, trade, I think those are very like,

32:25.940 --> 32:27.860
they're almost all gone nowadays.

32:27.860 --> 32:31.460
Like I don't think that there's a large market of aside from, I guess, you know what, there

32:31.460 --> 32:36.660
is more of a market out there because there's, you know, the Facebook marketplace type stuff.

32:36.660 --> 32:41.100
It is more accessible, like kind of the online marketplaces, but definitely like physical

32:41.100 --> 32:42.100
marketplaces.

32:42.100 --> 32:46.220
And, you know, we just had one of those businesses go out and because the buy, sell, trade model

32:46.220 --> 32:47.620
isn't working out for them.

32:47.620 --> 32:49.900
Well, physical media isn't working out for them either.

32:49.900 --> 32:52.180
But yeah, I don't know.

32:52.180 --> 32:55.580
Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, usually it's France who retweet retreats.

32:55.580 --> 32:58.540
Sorry, I screwed up your punchline.

32:58.540 --> 32:59.540
Zing.

32:59.540 --> 33:00.540
All right.

33:00.540 --> 33:02.140
Anyway, let's move on.

33:02.140 --> 33:03.140
Good discussion, though.

33:03.140 --> 33:06.300
I'm very curious to see what the next 30, I think we'll be revisiting this topic very

33:06.300 --> 33:10.340
soon in the next 30 days as that deadline gets closer.

33:10.340 --> 33:14.020
But in the meantime, let's take a trip around what we've been playing this week.

33:14.020 --> 33:16.900
I mentioned earlier in the show, it's been a very big week for video games.

33:16.900 --> 33:19.220
I think a lot of big releases this week.

33:19.220 --> 33:21.820
Let's talk about what we've gotten our hands on.

33:21.820 --> 33:24.900
But speaking of things that you have your hands on folks in our chat room now, this

33:24.900 --> 33:25.900
is an audio podcast.

33:25.900 --> 33:28.100
Of course, it has been for forever.

33:28.100 --> 33:30.740
So you guys can't see what the Twitch people are saying.

33:30.740 --> 33:33.580
But the Twitch people are noticing like, what the hell is Loki eating?

33:33.580 --> 33:35.180
Is he having like breadsticks for dinner?

33:35.180 --> 33:36.180
Yes, I am.

33:36.180 --> 33:37.300
Okay, so what is this?

33:37.300 --> 33:41.580
It's Italian cheese bread from Little Caesars.

33:41.580 --> 33:43.180
Okay, so there it is.

33:43.180 --> 33:44.300
And it does.

33:44.300 --> 33:46.300
It's it looks like a carbolicious meal.

33:46.300 --> 33:47.300
It sure does.

33:47.300 --> 33:48.300
It is.

33:48.300 --> 33:51.940
You've mentioned this before that one reason you prefer to do breadsticks to pizza is that

33:51.940 --> 33:54.700
it's like way cheaper to just not have sauce.

33:54.700 --> 33:55.700
Yeah.

33:55.700 --> 33:56.820
And also their pizza is not that great.

33:56.820 --> 34:01.340
And I was short on time today and my and as I mentioned on Twitter, I don't know if anyone

34:01.340 --> 34:02.340
actually follows.

34:02.340 --> 34:08.860
The chicken place I was really loving this Korean chicken, you know, oven chicken place.

34:08.860 --> 34:11.680
It went out of business.

34:11.680 --> 34:12.980
That was a recorded episode.

34:12.980 --> 34:14.580
That was the week I was out of town.

34:14.580 --> 34:16.180
It was super good.

34:16.180 --> 34:19.900
But like, and I got all my co-workers hooked on it.

34:19.900 --> 34:24.460
And then they went out of business and they're like, no, this is horrible.

34:24.460 --> 34:25.980
Why did you do that?

34:25.980 --> 34:30.780
You know, they don't pay their rent, I guess, you know, they get evicted.

34:30.780 --> 34:31.780
Yeah.

34:31.780 --> 34:33.020
Pod culture says smooshes favorite chicken.

34:33.020 --> 34:34.020
Yeah.

34:34.020 --> 34:36.540
I will say this, even though Smoosh was going a little crazy earlier, I thought I saw him

34:36.540 --> 34:37.540
lying down over here earlier.

34:37.540 --> 34:38.540
He left.

34:38.540 --> 34:39.540
He must have left.

34:39.540 --> 34:43.140
He when Loki brings something like this, the cat doesn't give a shit about cheesy bread.

34:43.140 --> 34:44.140
Yeah.

34:44.140 --> 34:45.140
It's the chicken that he wants.

34:45.140 --> 34:46.140
He doesn't care about.

34:46.140 --> 34:48.380
And I wanted to get chicken, but like, sorry, this isn't crazy.

34:48.380 --> 34:50.260
You very distinctly said this is not not crazy, right?

34:50.260 --> 34:52.100
Because this stuff's way better than crazy bread.

34:52.100 --> 34:56.660
It's more like a kind of a thick crust pizza without sauce and with cheese on it.

34:56.660 --> 34:57.660
All right.

34:57.660 --> 34:58.660
Let's get into video games.

34:58.660 --> 34:59.660
Can't talk about food all night.

34:59.660 --> 35:00.660
How was your gaming week?

35:01.540 --> 35:04.540
Um, I did not play any of the new games that came out this week and said I played Borderlands

35:04.540 --> 35:05.540
three.

35:05.540 --> 35:06.540
So I've been playing more of that.

35:06.540 --> 35:11.660
I'm on the second planet, probably leaving the second or leave, yeah, leaving the second

35:11.660 --> 35:12.660
planet.

35:12.660 --> 35:17.420
Um, I've been doing a lot of the side missions, so I don't have to go back.

35:17.420 --> 35:18.420
It's pretty fun.

35:18.420 --> 35:20.420
I like the game a lot.

35:20.420 --> 35:24.820
Um, yeah, I mean, there's not much really I can say about it.

35:24.820 --> 35:28.460
I've been wanting to do the Twitch streaming thing, but I haven't figured out how to download

35:28.460 --> 35:34.380
the plug in or whatever that you need to do that, because that would be pretty cool to,

35:34.380 --> 35:39.140
I guess, people that watch you can actually get loot and stuff in their games and they

35:39.140 --> 35:43.580
can give you loot or something somehow.

35:43.580 --> 35:46.100
So I do want to try that out at some point.

35:46.100 --> 35:50.420
But I've been doing that and then I've been working a little bit on my game, not so much

35:50.420 --> 35:54.940
this weekend, because like yesterday I was really tired.

35:54.940 --> 35:58.940
I did work on it yesterday, but this morning I wanted to work on it and I was up early

35:58.940 --> 36:02.400
because I couldn't sleep, but I couldn't sleep because I had a migraine.

36:02.400 --> 36:05.560
And so I couldn't really work on it because my brain hurt.

36:05.560 --> 36:08.820
And so, um, I'm getting there.

36:08.820 --> 36:14.280
I'm just trying to, I had the, I shifted everything to a different, so Unity has like their standard

36:14.280 --> 36:17.180
lighting engine and then they also have these new ones now.

36:17.180 --> 36:22.840
It's um, the lightweight render engine or render pipeline is what they call it.

36:22.840 --> 36:27.980
And so I switched all my assets over to that because you can do a thing called a shader

36:27.980 --> 36:33.700
graph that allows you to build shaders visually using like a graph and it's pretty cool.

36:33.700 --> 36:35.800
You can do all sorts of cool effects with it.

36:35.800 --> 36:40.420
So I switched everything over that and that took a long time to get everything to be where

36:40.420 --> 36:46.600
I wanted it to be and to actually show up like I wanted to and get the lighting correct.

36:46.600 --> 36:49.840
And then after I got done with that, I'm like, man, I'm wasting a lot of time on stuff that

36:49.840 --> 36:52.860
really should be part of polish and not actually part of the game.

36:52.860 --> 36:57.180
But I was doing that because I was trying to get respawning of stuff in and what I was

36:57.180 --> 36:58.420
doing was taking too long.

36:58.420 --> 37:01.620
And so I was like, well, just have stuff, just teleport in and like, I don't have a

37:01.620 --> 37:02.780
teleport effect.

37:02.780 --> 37:04.060
Let me build one of those.

37:04.060 --> 37:09.900
And so I did, but it was just kind of, it was a side mission on the, on the game development

37:09.900 --> 37:10.900
thing.

37:10.900 --> 37:14.860
So, um, but yeah, we're back, back on track of that and I'll be working through more of

37:14.860 --> 37:17.720
that game and play more Borderlands 3.

37:17.720 --> 37:23.540
I do want to play the untitled goose game and go through legends all as well, but not

37:23.540 --> 37:24.540
yet.

37:24.540 --> 37:25.540
Oh, and then Pokemon go.

37:25.540 --> 37:26.540
I've been playing a little bit of that.

37:26.540 --> 37:28.700
We'll talk a little more about that since it's coming up.

37:28.700 --> 37:30.620
They put a new poke stop at my park.

37:30.620 --> 37:35.740
I can't, I can't get my son's programming place to be a focus up, but they'll make the

37:35.740 --> 37:40.740
slide at my park, a pokey site structures are acceptable portals.

37:40.740 --> 37:43.220
So yeah, it makes sense.

37:43.220 --> 37:47.020
Whatever it works out for me because the next time we go to the park, I don't have to like

37:47.020 --> 37:50.040
walk over to where the, the pokey stop is or whatever.

37:50.040 --> 37:54.840
I can just sit and watch them play and just, aren't you level 10 and ingress, can you submit

37:54.840 --> 37:55.840
your own stuff?

37:55.840 --> 37:56.840
I do.

37:56.840 --> 37:57.840
Yeah, you should.

37:57.840 --> 37:58.840
I did.

37:58.840 --> 37:59.840
Cause you tried to get you.

37:59.840 --> 38:00.840
Okay.

38:00.840 --> 38:01.840
Yeah.

38:01.840 --> 38:02.840
And I submitted several times.

38:02.840 --> 38:03.840
I haven't gotten a rejection, but I haven't gotten an acceptance either.

38:03.840 --> 38:04.840
And that was back in may.

38:04.840 --> 38:05.840
Hmm.

38:05.840 --> 38:06.840
Interesting.

38:06.840 --> 38:09.120
I use using Ingers prime to submit is so much easier because you get to take the two photos

38:09.120 --> 38:11.400
and write a justification on why it should be accepted.

38:11.400 --> 38:12.400
Yeah.

38:12.400 --> 38:16.680
I think when I was doing it and probably wasn't letting me, I think I did it in, um, redacted,

38:16.680 --> 38:18.700
which I obviously won't be able to do very soon.

38:18.700 --> 38:19.700
So yeah.

38:19.700 --> 38:20.700
Yeah.

38:20.700 --> 38:21.700
Interesting.

38:21.700 --> 38:22.700
All right.

38:22.700 --> 38:23.700
Oh, I did.

38:23.700 --> 38:24.700
I did play ingress a little bit today too.

38:24.700 --> 38:28.260
Oh, cause we went to a new park that I, we know we've hit all the parks in the area,

38:28.260 --> 38:30.000
but apparently there was one that I missed.

38:30.000 --> 38:36.040
And so I went there and you know, I was like, well, I'm done with poke stop rate or I've

38:36.040 --> 38:39.320
hit all this, the Pokemon, the area, I'll leave a little bit over the ingress real quick.

38:39.320 --> 38:41.860
And then I captured the two portals there and get some uniques.

38:41.860 --> 38:42.860
Yeah.

38:42.860 --> 38:43.860
Yeah.

38:43.860 --> 38:44.860
That works.

38:44.860 --> 38:45.860
All right.

38:46.040 --> 38:50.560
Um, my gaming week, uh, Oh, real quickly, I want to mention before we get into my gaming

38:50.560 --> 38:54.880
week, cause I was talking about the subscription and all that stuff and how, uh, it's September

38:54.880 --> 38:55.880
and all that.

38:55.880 --> 39:00.840
I forgot to mention, uh, Bobby Blackwell found this cool little plugin for our discord server,

39:00.840 --> 39:04.840
where if you have your Twitch and your discord accounts, like connected, like you tell discord,

39:04.840 --> 39:06.480
like this is your Twitch and whatever.

39:06.480 --> 39:11.720
If you're actually a subscriber of our channel, you get access to a brand new chat room.

39:11.720 --> 39:13.120
That's only for subscribers.

39:13.120 --> 39:15.000
Um, I don't know.

39:15.140 --> 39:18.940
I mean, obviously we kind of want to limit the use of that because you know, we want

39:18.940 --> 39:23.140
everybody to have, you know, we don't want people to be limited by it like a money thing,

39:23.140 --> 39:26.300
but I've been like, okay, what are some, what are some things I can put in the subscriber

39:26.300 --> 39:29.780
chat to make people feel like, Ooh, I'm getting extra value.

39:29.780 --> 39:32.460
So I've been posting a cat picture.

39:32.460 --> 39:35.140
I posted some behind the scenes pictures today too.

39:35.140 --> 39:36.300
I did that during Bobby's show.

39:36.300 --> 39:39.460
I was like, Oh, maybe people would want to see like a little extra, like, what does it

39:39.460 --> 39:42.320
look like here in the studio from some other angles and things like that.

39:42.320 --> 39:43.700
So maybe, maybe I'll try to keep doing that.

39:43.700 --> 39:44.700
I don't know.

39:45.400 --> 39:47.600
I'll do what you want and I'll do my best to, uh, try to add that.

39:47.600 --> 39:50.800
But if you are a subscriber, make sure you got your Twitch and your discord kind of linked

39:50.800 --> 39:52.760
and then take out, take, cause it's all automated.

39:52.760 --> 39:56.440
We're not like manually adding people, uh, take a look at our discord server over at

39:56.440 --> 40:01.500
vog at network.com slash discord, and you can see that bonus little chat room that's

40:01.500 --> 40:02.500
right there.

40:02.500 --> 40:03.500
All right.

40:03.500 --> 40:04.500
Let's talk about my gaming week.

40:04.500 --> 40:07.560
So I have played, um, it's been a really good week for games.

40:07.560 --> 40:11.800
And of course, one of the big releases that came out this week was the remake of the legend

40:11.800 --> 40:13.480
of Zelda links awakening, right?

40:13.480 --> 40:17.840
So, um, this is actually video that we're showing on the Twitch feed.

40:17.840 --> 40:20.880
This is me playing, you can tell cause it's a Mr. Smoosh.

40:20.880 --> 40:24.660
So I did a little bit of a stream earlier in the week and, uh, I continue doing some

40:24.660 --> 40:28.380
playthrough and I did a little recording of like the first little bit of that.

40:28.380 --> 40:31.300
Um, and you can see just how cute this game is.

40:31.300 --> 40:35.860
I love the graphic style, um, that they went with, with the game.

40:35.860 --> 40:40.380
Uh, it kind of reminds me of, let's say a link to the past, which is ironic because

40:40.380 --> 40:45.520
I believe the game boy version started as a portable version of a link to the past that

40:45.520 --> 40:48.360
they kind of kind of turned into its own thing.

40:48.360 --> 40:51.960
Um, but you just saw on the Twitch feed, I access the map.

40:51.960 --> 40:55.960
I love how detailed this map is that they've added in the game because you can actually

40:55.960 --> 40:58.960
use map markers to help you find stuff.

40:58.960 --> 41:01.440
And um, I love the sense of humor this game has.

41:01.440 --> 41:05.240
Of course that was there a little bit in the original game as well, but man, it's just

41:05.240 --> 41:08.040
such, I mean, remember this game was on the fricking brick game boy.

41:08.040 --> 41:09.560
It was in black and white.

41:09.560 --> 41:13.260
The resolution on those things was what, like 144 pixels wide.

41:13.260 --> 41:16.400
Like it wasn't a lot that you could really fit on those things, but then they have like

41:16.400 --> 41:20.660
gameplay color version practically like a new, yes, it was one of those games that would

41:20.660 --> 41:23.500
play on the black and white and it would play on the color.

41:23.500 --> 41:28.660
Um, so, uh, yeah, uh, it, it would have some enhanced color, but come on, it looks nothing

41:28.660 --> 41:29.660
like this, right?

41:29.660 --> 41:34.080
Still, you're really limited by that, um, resolution, but, um, some of the re-imagining

41:34.080 --> 41:37.760
is some of the songs is done really well.

41:37.760 --> 41:41.180
Even the little doo, doo, doo, doo tone sounds like really cool.

41:41.180 --> 41:45.220
Um, Oh, which I think I just kind of hit in the video there.

41:45.220 --> 41:46.220
How ironic.

41:46.220 --> 41:52.880
Um, but yeah, so, um, it just looks so good and it's, it's like kind of like that classic

41:52.880 --> 41:53.880
Zelda.

41:53.880 --> 41:57.060
I mean, obviously Zelda's kind of gone like two different directions, right?

41:57.060 --> 42:01.620
Like this is the more Nintendo super Nintendo style, which we, which we got to revisit a

42:01.620 --> 42:05.220
little bit when they did a link between two worlds on the 3DS, right?

42:05.220 --> 42:10.480
So it's like we haven't had like a 2D or a 2.5 D Zelda in a long time.

42:10.480 --> 42:15.600
So this fills a void that I think a lot of us like people that really like their old

42:15.600 --> 42:16.600
school games.

42:16.600 --> 42:21.100
I think this game really fills a void that many of us have been like craving, even if

42:21.100 --> 42:22.960
it is a re-imagining of an older game.

42:22.960 --> 42:23.960
You know what?

42:23.960 --> 42:26.000
I barely fricking remember that old game.

42:26.000 --> 42:27.000
I never played the old game.

42:27.000 --> 42:30.160
Oh, well then it's practically like playing a new game for you.

42:30.160 --> 42:35.580
But I think even for me, like I kind of remembered the beginning-ish of the game a little bit,

42:35.580 --> 42:40.320
but then from there, I don't, I didn't even remember that you were trying to collect instruments.

42:40.320 --> 42:43.860
Like I didn't even remember that that was a thing in the game at all.

42:43.860 --> 42:47.500
So, um, it's almost like playing a brand new Zelda game to me, honestly.

42:47.500 --> 42:49.400
So I'm a big fan.

42:49.400 --> 42:53.180
I have not, however, sadly gotten to the dungeon maker mode yet.

42:53.180 --> 42:55.980
Um, that's something I think that I get a little later.

42:55.980 --> 42:59.180
Um, I, it does not seem to be in the game by default.

42:59.200 --> 43:04.100
Somebody was saying that it replaces like an older mode in the, um, old, uh, Link's Awakening

43:04.100 --> 43:05.340
game on the Game Boy.

43:05.340 --> 43:09.220
So it's something that I'll come across probably a little later in the game.

43:09.220 --> 43:13.900
So, uh, Slidekick in chat says it looks like a toy village and I want toys out of it.

43:13.900 --> 43:14.900
Yeah.

43:14.900 --> 43:17.900
I mean, it's just, well, you can get an amiibo, which I have resisted.

43:17.900 --> 43:20.260
I haven't really bought a lot of amiibo in a long time.

43:20.260 --> 43:24.100
It doesn't seem like it did, did very much other than like, it said it put a dark version

43:24.100 --> 43:26.820
of Link in your dungeon when you do the dungeon maker.

43:26.820 --> 43:27.820
Interesting.

43:27.820 --> 43:28.820
Yeah.

43:28.960 --> 43:34.180
The amiibo in these games shouldn't do a lot, you know, it shouldn't, it shouldn't like

43:34.180 --> 43:36.340
radically affect the game, right?

43:36.340 --> 43:39.460
So a little something, something is, is okay.

43:39.460 --> 43:42.340
So anyway, I am enjoying Link's Awakening.

43:42.340 --> 43:45.260
I just, I, I love the 2D Zelda.

43:45.260 --> 43:46.260
Don't get me wrong.

43:46.260 --> 43:51.600
Like Breath of the Wild really kind of really won me over on 3D Zelda games the way I'm

43:51.600 --> 43:54.260
not sure any other Zelda game has in a long time.

43:54.260 --> 43:57.460
I don't know when I first played Twilight Princess on the Wii, like I fricking loved

43:57.460 --> 43:58.460
that game too.

43:58.700 --> 44:02.620
You know, the 3D Zeldas have always been kind of just like a different direction to me.

44:02.620 --> 44:05.620
It's really great to revisit the old school Zelda games as well.

44:05.620 --> 44:09.180
So I am a big fan of that.

44:09.180 --> 44:14.060
I've also been playing a little bit of classic World of Warcraft, still leveling my priest.

44:14.060 --> 44:15.340
I see slykicks in chat.

44:15.340 --> 44:17.340
We've been actually teaming up on some things a little bit.

44:17.340 --> 44:22.400
I hit level 17 on my priest today, which for classic wow, that's like hitting end game

44:22.400 --> 44:23.400
and current wow.

44:23.400 --> 44:26.580
So I would say I'm doing pretty well so far.

44:26.580 --> 44:29.860
I'm at a high enough level where I could go to the dead mines pretty soon.

44:29.860 --> 44:32.660
I've still been playing Final Fantasy 14 as well.

44:32.660 --> 44:33.660
I don't know if Shane's in chat.

44:33.660 --> 44:37.700
I thought I saw him earlier, but we've still been teaming up a little bit.

44:37.700 --> 44:42.940
My gun blade, I always mess up the name of the, I was, I almost said gunslinger because

44:42.940 --> 44:47.260
I can never remember the right name of the class, but my gun blade I've, who have actually

44:47.260 --> 44:51.500
really been enjoying playing as a tank class.

44:51.500 --> 44:56.500
I love playing that class, um, is now level 72.

44:56.500 --> 44:58.500
I think I'm going to hit 72 yesterday.

44:58.500 --> 44:59.500
So that's, that's it.

44:59.500 --> 45:00.500
Oh, good.

45:00.500 --> 45:02.500
I still can't get the name right.

45:02.500 --> 45:04.500
It's gunbreaker.

45:04.500 --> 45:07.900
Shane, you know what ruined me?

45:07.900 --> 45:11.700
It's that one night when we were sitting there and we were calling it all these random wrong

45:11.700 --> 45:12.700
names.

45:12.700 --> 45:14.700
Now I can't remember the right names anymore.

45:14.700 --> 45:16.940
Uh, I'm dying.

45:16.940 --> 45:20.520
See my gunbreaker, whatever it's called is like level 72, which getting pretty close

45:20.560 --> 45:22.360
to max level, max levels 80.

45:22.360 --> 45:24.760
So I'm, I'm doing good.

45:24.760 --> 45:25.760
Just so you know.

45:25.760 --> 45:26.760
All right.

45:26.760 --> 45:30.040
That cat, what can you do?

45:30.040 --> 45:31.040
All right.

45:31.040 --> 45:35.040
Is his other dad should be home maybe in about 30 minutes and hopefully we'll shut him up.

45:35.040 --> 45:36.040
All right.

45:36.040 --> 45:39.800
Anyhow, I got to talk about one other game that I played this week because I love this

45:39.800 --> 45:40.800
game.

45:40.800 --> 45:42.920
So, you know, a lot of people are saying that this is like a new music game that you really

45:42.920 --> 45:44.480
have to check out, right?

45:44.480 --> 45:48.720
I don't know if I would say that this is a music game, but it's a game you really should

45:48.720 --> 45:49.720
check out.

45:49.920 --> 45:55.360
Sayonara Wild Hearts and uh, Willie has some gameplay on Twitch, uh, that again, I recorded

45:55.360 --> 45:57.600
this myself, so there's flaws and everything.

45:57.600 --> 46:02.240
You're going to see me hit a wall at some point and it just kind of, it just drops you

46:02.240 --> 46:04.740
back a little bit and you have to kind of keep going.

46:04.740 --> 46:09.320
So folks are calling this a music game and I felt like it was something I kind of had

46:09.320 --> 46:12.840
to check out because I am a fan of music games and things like that.

46:12.840 --> 46:17.200
Um, I actually, I'm not sure this is a music game.

46:17.200 --> 46:21.440
Are there parts of the game where you have to like hit a button in a certain rhythm?

46:21.440 --> 46:23.840
Yes, that does exist.

46:23.840 --> 46:25.840
Is the soundtrack incredible?

46:25.840 --> 46:26.840
Fuck yes it is.

46:26.840 --> 46:27.840
This is an incredible soundtrack.

46:27.840 --> 46:31.660
I know it's really hard for you to hear in the studio because we have to lower the audio

46:31.660 --> 46:35.440
or they can't hear over our voices and we have to echo, um, but hopefully over the stream

46:35.440 --> 46:38.640
and on the podcast you can hear a little bit of music in the background.

46:38.640 --> 46:40.640
It is a great soundtrack.

46:40.640 --> 46:44.640
I mean, it's just like, I actually looked up the soundtrack on Spotify and I've been

46:44.640 --> 46:45.640
listening to it in my car.

46:45.640 --> 46:46.640
It's so good.

46:47.080 --> 46:49.560
Um, so what is the game if it's not really a music game?

46:49.560 --> 46:50.960
You know what it is to me?

46:50.960 --> 46:51.960
Okay.

46:51.960 --> 46:53.680
It kind of, see, here's the rhythm part.

46:53.680 --> 46:57.400
That's where like, I'm actually like hitting the button with it, but this game is so fucking

46:57.400 --> 46:58.400
stylish.

46:58.400 --> 46:59.400
I mean, look at it.

46:59.400 --> 47:04.920
Like they're freaking jumping and doing twirls and going down this road and now she's flying

47:04.920 --> 47:09.500
through the air and it's like this pilot wings type of sequence or something and it just,

47:09.500 --> 47:10.500
it looks beautiful.

47:10.500 --> 47:15.040
This is one of those games where it's like, you're going to sit there and tell me video

47:15.040 --> 47:16.040
games aren't art.

47:16.040 --> 47:20.800
Fucking play Sayonara Wild Hearts because this is like art in motion.

47:20.800 --> 47:21.800
It's beautiful.

47:21.800 --> 47:24.960
Um, but I would say this game, you know what it reminds me of?

47:24.960 --> 47:25.960
Okay.

47:25.960 --> 47:28.600
Do you guys remember the bonus stage in Sonic the Hedgehog 2?

47:28.600 --> 47:29.600
No.

47:29.600 --> 47:30.600
No.

47:30.600 --> 47:33.400
You remember you had that big tail pipe and you would run up and down and collect the

47:33.400 --> 47:37.560
rings and like you would try to avoid the little spikes and things.

47:37.560 --> 47:38.560
Okay.

47:38.560 --> 47:41.480
That, but make it 2019.

47:41.480 --> 47:47.200
I kind of feel like that's the best way I can describe Sayonara Wild Hearts.

47:47.200 --> 47:54.880
Imagine Sonic the Hedgehog 2's bonus stage, but like 2019 and a beautiful as hell.

47:54.880 --> 47:58.820
Oh, this is another stage that, cause I wanted to make sure I included more than one song.

47:58.820 --> 48:01.860
So there's another stage that's a little more of a first person view.

48:01.860 --> 48:06.440
So it almost feels like you're playing like a racing game at some points until you know,

48:06.440 --> 48:08.160
again, it gets very stylish.

48:08.160 --> 48:09.580
Now it's a shooter.

48:09.580 --> 48:12.660
You're like auto shooting these obstacles that are ahead of you.

48:12.660 --> 48:16.940
And at some point if I talk long, long enough, you get to see like the big three headed dog

48:16.940 --> 48:18.940
that comes out and all this stuff.

48:18.940 --> 48:23.980
Um, S200 Matt in chat says Annapurna Interactive does such amazing games like this.

48:23.980 --> 48:24.980
Yeah.

48:24.980 --> 48:25.980
They're a great publishing company.

48:25.980 --> 48:30.860
Uh, the developer was another company out of Sweden whose name I forget in the moment,

48:30.860 --> 48:35.660
but they are very big on like iPhone games has been their bread and butter.

48:35.660 --> 48:40.660
Um, and so this is their first game that was kind of beyond just the iPhone.

48:40.660 --> 48:42.140
Now this game is available on iPhone.

48:42.140 --> 48:46.340
It's actually a Apple arcade because that was the whole big thing last week.

48:46.340 --> 48:47.340
Right?

48:47.340 --> 48:48.340
Yeah.

48:48.340 --> 48:51.340
So some people are experienced because all it is, it's just, uh, even if you are playing

48:51.340 --> 48:55.340
on the Nintendo switch where I captured this game, it's just using the controller and then

48:55.340 --> 48:56.340
using the button.

48:56.340 --> 48:57.340
That's it.

48:57.340 --> 48:58.340
It's controller slash one button.

48:58.340 --> 49:02.340
So I imagine on a mobile, it's just probably like dragging around the screen, probably

49:02.340 --> 49:03.340
very simple.

49:03.340 --> 49:11.020
Uh, it is also available on PlayStation four, not available on Android and also not available

49:11.020 --> 49:12.020
on PC.

49:12.020 --> 49:16.620
So you would have to do PS4, no Xbox, no Xbox right now.

49:16.620 --> 49:20.460
No, it's, it's an interesting kind of lineup, but I think I'm a fat out of B roll there.

49:20.460 --> 49:25.180
It's an interesting lineup though of, uh, you know, the, uh, the iPhone and then two

49:25.180 --> 49:29.100
more traditional consoles with the switch and the PlayStation four, but I highly recommend

49:29.100 --> 49:30.100
it.

49:30.100 --> 49:32.500
I think if you are a fan of music games, you're going to like this enough.

49:32.500 --> 49:35.500
I just, you know, when I first heard it was a music game, I was like, Oh, it's going to

49:35.500 --> 49:40.100
be like elite beat agents, or it's going to be like, you know, guitar, Roman or something.

49:40.100 --> 49:44.260
I don't know if I really see that, but I just think the soundtrack is so good and kind of

49:44.260 --> 49:45.460
adjacent to the music.

49:45.460 --> 49:46.460
I really enjoyed it.

49:46.460 --> 49:49.940
A lot of those games, I think most music game fans are going to get a kick enough out of

49:49.940 --> 49:50.940
this.

49:50.940 --> 49:53.100
I, I, I think this will be one of my top games of the year.

49:53.100 --> 49:54.100
I really do.

49:54.100 --> 49:56.860
Uh, the one complaint it's really short, it's a short game.

49:56.860 --> 50:00.780
So there's a lot of people that are probably going to be like, Oh, I beat it in two hours.

50:00.780 --> 50:01.780
That's it.

50:01.780 --> 50:05.460
Um, you know, like most music games, there's only what, like 20 songs in it or something

50:05.460 --> 50:06.460
like that.

50:06.460 --> 50:09.460
So once you kind of get there, it does tell a story it's, uh, you know, kind of from start

50:09.460 --> 50:12.220
to finish, I'll, I'll let you all kind of experience that on your own if you want to

50:12.220 --> 50:13.220
play it.

50:13.220 --> 50:14.440
Um, but it is a short game.

50:14.440 --> 50:18.300
I would say though, it's one of those games where there's a lot of room for improvement.

50:18.300 --> 50:24.100
Um, and, uh, if you, uh, you might, I have yet to get a gold rank on a stage.

50:24.100 --> 50:25.100
Let me put it that way.

50:25.100 --> 50:28.260
I've gotten some bronze ranks, some silver ranks, but it's really hard.

50:28.260 --> 50:31.500
You really have to memorize the patterns and what's coming up in order to get a gold

50:31.500 --> 50:32.500
rank.

50:32.500 --> 50:34.500
So there is some replay value in that regard.

50:34.500 --> 50:36.540
And here's some other interesting news.

50:36.540 --> 50:39.980
The game kind of has a Bobby Black Wolf mode sort of built in.

50:39.980 --> 50:44.780
So what'll happen, um, if you keep slamming into the same tree over and over, let's say

50:44.780 --> 50:50.220
once you screw up like three or four times, what'll happen is one of the like spirits,

50:50.220 --> 50:53.900
it's kind of part of the game's mythology will show up and say, it seems that you're

50:53.900 --> 50:55.780
having difficulty passing this part.

50:55.780 --> 50:57.540
Would you like to skip this part?

50:57.540 --> 50:59.660
And you can just skip right past it and go to the next part.

50:59.660 --> 51:05.360
Um, or you can say no, or you can say no and never offer this again.

51:05.360 --> 51:09.060
So depending on the type of gamer you are, you know, if you're Bobby Black Wolf, you

51:09.060 --> 51:11.020
might say, yeah, I'm going to skip this one part.

51:11.020 --> 51:12.020
It's kind of hard.

51:12.020 --> 51:15.020
But if you're like, you know, that hardcore gamer, you can say no and never bother me

51:15.020 --> 51:16.060
ever again.

51:16.060 --> 51:17.340
So there is that.

51:17.340 --> 51:21.940
So, uh, uh, Shad is in chat saying, have you tackled the hidden riddles yet?

51:21.940 --> 51:22.940
No, I have not.

51:22.940 --> 51:26.640
I've, I've, I feel like I've barely scratched the surface on what this game has to offer.

51:26.640 --> 51:30.720
So, um, I've got plenty more to explore, but, uh, it's just, what can I say?

51:30.720 --> 51:33.040
It's been a crazy week for games, lots of stuff.

51:33.040 --> 51:35.660
There's other games that came out that I haven't gotten around to yet.

51:35.660 --> 51:40.080
I know a lot of people are really excited about the, um, I keep wanting to say asshole

51:40.080 --> 51:44.480
goose game, but I guess they really did officially change the title, untitled goose game.

51:44.480 --> 51:48.460
I guess it's probably easier to convince more families to play it, uh, when it's untitled

51:48.460 --> 51:51.320
goose game, but y'all know wink, wink, nudge, nudge.

51:51.320 --> 51:52.320
That's why it's untitled.

51:52.320 --> 51:53.320
Right?

51:53.320 --> 51:55.520
Cause it wasn't the development name, asshole goose game.

51:55.520 --> 51:56.520
I don't know.

51:56.520 --> 51:57.520
All right.

51:57.520 --> 51:58.520
Anyway, I swear.

51:58.520 --> 52:00.280
I think that's what they just, people are calling it.

52:00.280 --> 52:01.280
Yeah.

52:01.280 --> 52:05.120
So, uh, I still need to get on that, but it's been, and, and Shane is in chat saying, yeah,

52:05.120 --> 52:07.120
you haven't played the best game of the year that came out this week.

52:07.120 --> 52:08.400
I know he's a big fan of it.

52:08.400 --> 52:11.600
Uh, hopefully we'll hear from the, uh, hear from him later in the show to tell us more

52:11.600 --> 52:12.600
about the game.

52:12.600 --> 52:16.120
Um, but, uh, yeah, it's just, there's, this has been a really good week for games.

52:16.120 --> 52:18.480
The fall season is here, right?

52:18.480 --> 52:24.360
Like the first leaf falls from the tree, pumpkin spice lattes are in full swing and here come

52:24.360 --> 52:27.360
the fall video game releases like big time.

52:27.360 --> 52:31.160
This week was huge and it's just, what are some other big, I mean, borderlands as well

52:31.160 --> 52:32.560
was just within the past two weeks.

52:32.560 --> 52:33.560
Yeah.

52:33.560 --> 52:34.560
I mean that was a huge kickoff too.

52:34.560 --> 52:35.920
What do we have coming up in the next couple weeks?

52:35.920 --> 52:36.920
Control was another one.

52:36.920 --> 52:37.920
Oh yeah.

52:37.920 --> 52:38.920
Control.

52:38.920 --> 52:39.920
Oh my God.

52:39.920 --> 52:40.920
I want to play that one too.

52:40.920 --> 52:42.720
And in the next couple of weeks, what, we have a big one coming out this week too.

52:42.720 --> 52:43.720
Right.

52:43.720 --> 52:46.280
Um, I feel like there was something this weekend that's a big deal.

52:46.280 --> 52:47.280
That's coming out too.

52:47.280 --> 52:48.760
There's a lot of stuff going on.

52:48.760 --> 52:53.400
So there's probably, I mean, there's always big stuff coming out in the fourth quarter.

52:53.400 --> 52:54.400
Yeah.

52:54.400 --> 52:59.200
Don't say leading up to the, uh, it was a big release this weekend.

52:59.200 --> 53:05.400
Maybe I'm, yeah, there's, um, a few things coming out.

53:05.400 --> 53:12.320
Um, you know, anything really huge that jumps out at me, there was something, I don't know.

53:12.320 --> 53:13.320
It's fine.

53:13.320 --> 53:14.320
You know, CUNY was last week.

53:14.320 --> 53:17.040
So you know, well, yeah, there's another one I got to pick up, although that one's just

53:17.040 --> 53:20.920
kind of like a redo on the switch, so I feel a little okay skipping that one cause I did

53:20.920 --> 53:21.920
play that.

53:21.920 --> 53:26.000
Um, also I guess I could say this one other little FIFA, that's another one.

53:26.000 --> 53:32.040
One other little thing that I picked up was I found, um, at Walmart, another for my little

53:32.040 --> 53:36.800
mini arcade machine collection, they have mortal combat now in the collection.

53:36.800 --> 53:38.520
That's actually, um, on Twitch.

53:38.520 --> 53:41.400
For those that are looking towards the right side of the screen, there's a Pac-Man that's

53:41.400 --> 53:44.960
brand new as well in color, but you know, Pac-Man y'all seen Pac-Man, but now there's

53:44.960 --> 53:46.000
a mortal combat.

53:46.000 --> 53:49.200
And what's funny about the mortal combat, um, I'm actually going to show this on screen

53:49.200 --> 53:50.200
here.

53:50.200 --> 53:51.200
I'll walk up.

53:51.680 --> 53:56.440
But there's actually six buttons on the mortal combat machine and look, he was like, what's

53:56.440 --> 53:57.440
that for?

53:57.440 --> 53:58.600
It has two block buttons for whatever reason.

53:58.600 --> 54:00.040
I don't know why they set it up.

54:00.040 --> 54:03.240
Like you said that it was emulated off of the Genesis version.

54:03.240 --> 54:06.460
So when you look at it, it really looks like the Genesis version.

54:06.460 --> 54:07.460
So here's the funny thing.

54:07.460 --> 54:11.480
I bought two because the other was for dark Sakura.

54:11.480 --> 54:15.680
So I want to show you, uh, what it looks like real quick on the Twitch stream, but you're

54:15.680 --> 54:18.040
going to have to talk through this here while I do this.

54:18.040 --> 54:19.040
Yeah.

54:19.080 --> 54:20.080
Um, yeah.

54:20.080 --> 54:22.960
Cause I noticed something like, well, doesn't that normally have five buttons?

54:22.960 --> 54:25.760
That's kind of weird, but yeah, there it is.

54:25.760 --> 54:30.840
And it's, it's glory.

54:30.840 --> 54:36.800
It's very, uh, lifelike and you can tell it kind of looks like the Genesis version to

54:36.800 --> 54:37.800
me.

54:37.800 --> 54:43.200
I mean, but I mean, I mean, it's still like, you know, can you imagine back when you're

54:43.200 --> 54:48.160
playing moral combat when it first came out that, Hey, you know, someday they're going

54:48.160 --> 54:49.980
to have a tabletop version of that.

54:49.980 --> 54:53.840
That's really, you know, I know a few bucks.

54:53.840 --> 54:57.000
I'm trying to think of how to like tell people how big that is.

54:57.000 --> 55:01.280
It's about like, it's not that much bigger than like maybe my stream tech.

55:01.280 --> 55:02.280
I don't know.

55:02.280 --> 55:05.320
I don't know how to like relate the size of that thing, but it's really not that big.

55:05.320 --> 55:09.960
So, uh, dark Tetsuya does point out moral combat is the Genesis one, but there's no

55:09.960 --> 55:10.960
blood code.

55:10.960 --> 55:11.960
See, I knew it.

55:11.960 --> 55:15.400
I knew there was going to be something with those that they wouldn't, that I was like,

55:15.400 --> 55:17.800
they sell these in the kid's aisle.

55:17.800 --> 55:20.840
They've got to do something because I was even talking to the checkout lady about it.

55:20.840 --> 55:23.120
Uh, she was saying something like, Oh, mortal combat.

55:23.120 --> 55:26.880
They have this in one of these little machines and I was like, yeah, uh, I'm like, it's,

55:26.880 --> 55:27.880
it's back there.

55:27.880 --> 55:31.280
I said, I bet though I wouldn't buy it for kids, but they have Pac-Man as well.

55:31.280 --> 55:34.920
I don't remember the topic kind of came up, but, um, yeah, I kind of figured if it was

55:34.920 --> 55:37.280
the Genesis version, it may not, a lot of people forget.

55:37.280 --> 55:38.280
Yes.

55:38.280 --> 55:41.480
The Genesis version had blood, but you had to put in a code.

55:41.480 --> 55:42.480
What was it?

55:42.480 --> 55:44.480
A B B A C A Abiaka or something.

55:44.480 --> 55:45.480
I don't remember.

55:45.480 --> 55:46.480
Do you guys remember the code?

55:46.560 --> 55:51.160
Who remembers the blood code, but I don't think you can just put it in, in that machine.

55:51.160 --> 55:54.960
Sadly, um, uh, sort of adjacent to this one, Abba cab.

55:54.960 --> 55:59.080
Oh, I was really close Abba cab, uh, ABB, AC ABB.

55:59.080 --> 56:03.280
Um, tiger class says, speaking of mortal combat, I posted a video that had the actors who played

56:03.280 --> 56:06.440
Lou Kang and Johnny cage playing on the mortal combat arcade.

56:06.440 --> 56:09.200
One up cabinet, the actors from the original mortal combat movie.

56:09.200 --> 56:10.520
That is not the new one.

56:10.520 --> 56:14.920
Um, Oh, from the movie, like, see, when I originally saw actors from moral combat, I

56:14.920 --> 56:19.360
thought it was the people that they performance captured for the moral combat was the original.

56:19.360 --> 56:20.360
That's weird.

56:20.360 --> 56:21.360
It was the original mortal combat movie.

56:21.360 --> 56:22.360
Oh yeah.

56:22.360 --> 56:23.360
Tiger club.

56:23.360 --> 56:27.800
Put that in our discord over, uh, vog network.com VOG network.com slash discord, um, actually

56:27.800 --> 56:28.800
put that video.

56:28.800 --> 56:33.280
I imagine the whole thing was probably a sales pitch for the arcade one up because, uh, actually

56:33.280 --> 56:36.420
not only do you see the baby machine, but then when I went over to the software area,

56:36.420 --> 56:40.840
they had those big arcade one up cabinets for like 299 bucks or however they went.

56:40.840 --> 56:43.680
And I saw the mortal combat one sitting there, Lord.

56:43.680 --> 56:45.160
I was tempted.

56:45.160 --> 56:52.320
I was tempted, but since I'm like new at my job still, and I'm in that awkward, I got

56:52.320 --> 56:55.320
paid from the last job, but I haven't gotten paid at the new job yet.

56:55.320 --> 56:59.040
You know, y'all know, if you ever change, y'all know that you end up in that weird kind

56:59.040 --> 57:03.720
of like times where you don't have a paycheck for a little bit.

57:03.720 --> 57:06.600
Um, so that's in that weird gap that I'm at right now.

57:06.600 --> 57:11.120
So, um, I have to wait until I spoil myself with things like that.

57:11.280 --> 57:15.680
Uh, Tochen says, go get the mortal combat to arcade one up bundle from Costco.

57:15.680 --> 57:16.680
It's upgrading.

57:16.680 --> 57:17.680
You get more for your dollar.

57:17.680 --> 57:18.760
You know, it's like $300.

57:18.760 --> 57:19.760
That one was 20 bucks.

57:19.760 --> 57:22.000
Not even that was like 1980, something like that.

57:22.000 --> 57:24.880
So I do want those arcade one up machines though.

57:24.880 --> 57:25.880
Don't get me wrong.

57:25.880 --> 57:28.120
But then I'm also like, where the fuck am I going to fit that in this house?

57:28.120 --> 57:31.420
I have, I need less crap in this house, not more crap.

57:31.420 --> 57:32.420
That's the other big problem.

57:32.420 --> 57:33.420
All right.

57:33.420 --> 57:35.200
Anyway, that's enough for our gaming weeks.

57:35.200 --> 57:38.200
I think we should get into some of the news stories from this week.

57:38.280 --> 57:42.560
We're going to start off with, we were just talking about this during our gaming weeks.

57:42.560 --> 57:44.280
So let's get into, uh, Pokemon.

57:44.280 --> 57:45.280
Yeah.

57:45.280 --> 57:50.200
So Pokemon go has expanded into the Unova region, which I thought it was just a few

57:50.200 --> 57:51.200
of them that came out.

57:51.200 --> 57:54.840
I didn't realize that it was the whole thing, but, um, apparently, yeah, they've got quite

57:54.840 --> 57:56.760
a few new Pokemon.

57:56.760 --> 58:05.360
So um, right now it's, it looks like about like maybe like eight to 10 new Pokemon that

58:05.360 --> 58:06.360
are popping up.

58:06.400 --> 58:10.200
I've gotten a few of the angry chipmunk one and also the pigeon.

58:10.200 --> 58:11.640
I love the pigeon one.

58:11.640 --> 58:13.480
It's my new favorite.

58:13.480 --> 58:17.400
Um, and Shane's bringing up a very important point in our chat room is that it's not all

58:17.400 --> 58:18.400
a gen five.

58:18.400 --> 58:20.080
It's like the first part.

58:20.080 --> 58:21.800
They're doing this like they did gen four.

58:21.800 --> 58:25.840
They're giving you the starters and some of the trashy Mon, you know, a little taste.

58:25.840 --> 58:30.520
Um, but it's not the whole thing, but Shane, I'm surprised your reaction wasn't more like,

58:30.520 --> 58:33.680
we got Oshawa and that's all that we need.

58:33.680 --> 58:35.520
You want to hear what I did this week?

58:35.520 --> 58:39.320
You want to hear, I'm going to expose Shane as the cheater he is, but I enabled it a little

58:39.320 --> 58:40.320
bit.

58:40.320 --> 58:44.240
So Shane's favorite Pokemon is Oshawa, which is one of the starters in gen five, right?

58:44.240 --> 58:48.600
The, the cute little like otter thing with the shell on its chest, which I never realized

58:48.600 --> 58:51.200
he actually like rips off the chest and like attacks with.

58:51.200 --> 58:52.600
It's like super cute.

58:52.600 --> 58:58.120
Um, so, uh, that's his favorite, but that one's, it's really hard to find.

58:58.120 --> 58:59.920
They don't have those everywhere.

58:59.920 --> 59:05.360
So I think Shane was able to catch like one, uh, in his adventures well in looking at the

59:05.400 --> 59:09.520
local discord down in Elk Grove here locally at the sports park there.

59:09.520 --> 59:10.520
Guess what?

59:10.520 --> 59:12.180
It's an Oshawa nest.

59:12.180 --> 59:16.920
So Shane logged out of his account, stayed out of his account for five hours and then

59:16.920 --> 59:24.680
had me log into his account at this nest and just catch Oshawa at the park so that then

59:24.680 --> 59:28.300
we stayed out of it for another five hours or whatever the travel time would feasibly

59:28.300 --> 59:31.000
be at a Boise to hop on a plane or whatever.

59:31.000 --> 59:34.880
And uh, he logged into back into the account and he had a ton of Oshawa because actually

59:34.920 --> 59:35.920
it wasn't just that.

59:35.920 --> 59:40.520
So it wasn't just me catching them, but then Alan, and this was Alan's idea, Alan caught

59:40.520 --> 59:45.400
a bunch as well and was like, well, why don't I just trade Shane?

59:45.400 --> 59:48.760
Like like I'm going to have 20 of these, only two or three of them are going to be decently

59:48.760 --> 59:49.760
appraised.

59:49.760 --> 59:54.760
I'll just trade all these one star zero star Oshawa and he can have more.

59:54.760 --> 59:57.240
And I was like, Shane would probably really like that.

59:57.240 --> 59:59.780
So we filled up his account with Oshawa.

59:59.780 --> 01:00:04.400
So I know, and, and one of those Oshawa when we traded one of them went lucky.

01:00:04.440 --> 01:00:07.040
So he got like a lucky on his account.

01:00:07.040 --> 01:00:09.200
So I know he's got to be happy with all that thing.

01:00:09.200 --> 01:00:13.460
So, uh, so yeah, the gen five starters, they do nest.

01:00:13.460 --> 01:00:17.040
It's just that since they're competing with all the other nests out there, they can be

01:00:17.040 --> 01:00:18.040
hard to find.

01:00:18.040 --> 01:00:23.680
Um, but I imagine the other, uh, uh, starters, the little fire piggy, uh, and the grass thing

01:00:23.680 --> 01:00:25.600
that looks like all the other grass things.

01:00:25.600 --> 01:00:30.400
Um, they also nest, uh, as well, which I haven't caught either of those other starters.

01:00:30.400 --> 01:00:33.360
Oshawa's the only starter I've caught so far, but I did.

01:00:33.360 --> 01:00:37.440
I went out there and caught, you know, P dove and there was one, one little cat things

01:00:37.440 --> 01:00:40.080
per something was on the house earlier.

01:00:40.080 --> 01:00:46.160
Um, I got the, like I said, it looked like an angry chipmunk or something.

01:00:46.160 --> 01:00:47.360
I don't know what that is.

01:00:47.360 --> 01:00:49.320
Oh, the, uh, Pat rat.

01:00:49.320 --> 01:00:52.160
Uh, maybe I know they get my decks here.

01:00:52.160 --> 01:00:53.160
Let's see.

01:00:53.160 --> 01:00:54.160
Yeah.

01:00:54.160 --> 01:01:01.620
So it was, I got the, um, yeah, Pat rat and then, um, the little pup and I swear the pigeon

01:01:01.620 --> 01:01:02.960
one was one as well.

01:01:02.960 --> 01:01:05.520
But maybe is that last gen still?

01:01:05.520 --> 01:01:07.320
No P dove is gen five.

01:01:07.320 --> 01:01:08.320
Really?

01:01:08.320 --> 01:01:09.320
Yeah.

01:01:09.320 --> 01:01:10.320
Where is it then?

01:01:10.320 --> 01:01:11.320
Did I not catch it?

01:01:11.320 --> 01:01:12.320
Maybe you haven't caught it yet.

01:01:12.320 --> 01:01:13.960
I started to get this from gen five.

01:01:13.960 --> 01:01:17.200
I actually, I just caught, there was an evolved because I had a silhouette.

01:01:17.200 --> 01:01:18.200
Oh no, here it is.

01:01:18.200 --> 01:01:19.200
Here it is.

01:01:19.200 --> 01:01:20.200
I didn't know it.

01:01:20.200 --> 01:01:21.240
See, it was stuck at the bottom there.

01:01:21.240 --> 01:01:23.600
One of the evolved, one of those I caught in the wild randomly.

01:01:23.600 --> 01:01:27.240
I didn't think I'd find one of those, but it was at the park and I was walking around

01:01:27.240 --> 01:01:28.240
there earlier today.

01:01:28.240 --> 01:01:32.920
So, um, but yeah, uh, I got to say gen five kind of has me interested in Pokemon again.

01:01:32.960 --> 01:01:36.600
Cause I was, I was really burned out on it, um, honestly.

01:01:36.600 --> 01:01:39.480
And then when Harry Potter came out, I was like, Oh, something else to play.

01:01:39.480 --> 01:01:45.040
But now it's like, I'm kind of burned out on Ingress at this point, which is bad because

01:01:45.040 --> 01:01:51.200
Ingress, uh, we have that anomaly coming up here locally, but I think it's all the, and

01:01:51.200 --> 01:01:52.440
I don't know how much I can really talk about it.

01:01:52.440 --> 01:01:54.540
It's all the planning that goes into an anomaly.

01:01:54.540 --> 01:01:59.680
I'm like already like, can this anomaly be done please?

01:01:59.680 --> 01:02:01.480
So I'm kind of like burned out on Ingress at this point.

01:02:01.480 --> 01:02:04.660
So Pokemon goes kind of like the thing where I'm like, okay, Ooh, there's something new

01:02:04.660 --> 01:02:06.480
and shiny going on over here.

01:02:06.480 --> 01:02:08.520
So I want to go play this game for a little bit.

01:02:08.520 --> 01:02:10.760
So it's fun kind of catching the new stuff.

01:02:10.760 --> 01:02:14.240
So people are like finally getting presents from me again when people were like, why haven't

01:02:14.240 --> 01:02:15.720
you sent me a present in two months?

01:02:15.720 --> 01:02:20.120
Cause I haven't been playing, I got distracted by like Harry Potter and stuff.

01:02:20.120 --> 01:02:21.480
What can I, what can I say?

01:02:21.480 --> 01:02:22.480
All right.

01:02:22.480 --> 01:02:27.000
Um, uh, Totion says, Rob, don't forget about those hot Mr. Mime eggs.

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:32.760
I didn't get a shiny Mr. Mime, but I did get a shiny, um, Tauros hatched from an egg.

01:02:32.760 --> 01:02:37.560
And I caught shiny, two of them, shiny Yanma are going on this weekend.

01:02:37.560 --> 01:02:41.880
Those really gross looking bug things, but they're green and blue and the shiny one,

01:02:41.880 --> 01:02:44.120
they're kind of a cute little, uh, color combination.

01:02:44.120 --> 01:02:48.560
I caught two randomly at work, so I guess I shouldn't complain cause I bet some people

01:02:48.560 --> 01:02:51.620
are having a hard time even, uh, capturing one.

01:02:51.620 --> 01:02:55.120
So now act deaf to screaming at me to open my damn gifts.

01:02:55.160 --> 01:02:56.320
I'm sorry.

01:02:56.320 --> 01:02:58.760
It's because we're already four star friends act deaf.

01:02:58.760 --> 01:03:02.420
So I tend to prioritize the people that are lower on the list.

01:03:02.420 --> 01:03:03.420
So sorry.

01:03:03.420 --> 01:03:09.480
Um, I will do my best, but yeah, if we weren't limited to 20 a day, I'd open more gifts,

01:03:09.480 --> 01:03:14.320
but yeah, it's, I am really bad at opening gifts, but like when I'm out there for community

01:03:14.320 --> 01:03:19.420
day, I think on community day, I sent a gift to every single person on my list.

01:03:19.420 --> 01:03:23.280
If I could, unless you like had one in the backlog, I don't know.

01:03:23.280 --> 01:03:24.280
Anyway.

01:03:24.320 --> 01:03:24.820
All right.

01:03:24.820 --> 01:03:27.200
So Pokemon go, we'll see how long the gen five thing lasts for.

01:03:27.200 --> 01:03:31.840
And hopefully, um, people will be, um, continue to be interested in the game.

01:03:31.840 --> 01:03:35.160
Uh, but what long, what long legs this game has had?

01:03:35.160 --> 01:03:35.660
Yes.

01:03:35.660 --> 01:03:36.160
Right.

01:03:36.920 --> 01:03:40.720
When most people thought it was, yeah, most people said it was a dead game a long time

01:03:40.720 --> 01:03:41.720
ago.

01:03:41.720 --> 01:03:44.480
Um, this game has a very long life.

01:03:44.480 --> 01:03:49.880
This series anyway, dragon quest is the next series to talk about dragon quest one, two,

01:03:49.880 --> 01:03:55.960
and three, those new little remakes, uh, the little, uh, reimagining of the game.

01:03:55.960 --> 01:04:00.800
They are coming out in the U S that's very exciting because these were available in Japan

01:04:00.800 --> 01:04:01.800
previously.

01:04:01.800 --> 01:04:05.420
Uh, it's kind of like a reimagined version of dragon quest one, two, and three, which

01:04:05.420 --> 01:04:08.760
of course with the NES games in the series back in the day.

01:04:08.760 --> 01:04:13.580
Um, so they, the, the reimagining or it's just kind of like HD textures and things like

01:04:13.580 --> 01:04:20.220
that are coming out, uh, on the Nintendo switch eShop on September 27th, just in time

01:04:20.220 --> 01:04:26.480
for dragon quest 11 S echoes of an elusive age that is also launching the same day.

01:04:26.480 --> 01:04:28.620
And I'm sure many people are looking forward to that.

01:04:28.620 --> 01:04:33.860
Um, I don't, I want to get dragon quest 11, but it's like, I already bought it on PlayStation

01:04:33.860 --> 01:04:34.860
four.

01:04:34.860 --> 01:04:38.820
So I'm kind of waiting to see if maybe there will be a price reduction or something like

01:04:38.820 --> 01:04:39.820
that.

01:04:39.820 --> 01:04:40.820
Couple of things.

01:04:40.820 --> 01:04:42.700
We'll see what one, we became lucky friends.

01:04:42.700 --> 01:04:45.620
Did we really to your cat's eating plastic?

01:04:45.620 --> 01:04:46.620
So I'm not really sure.

01:04:46.620 --> 01:04:47.620
All right.

01:04:47.620 --> 01:04:48.820
I need to take care of the smush thing.

01:04:48.820 --> 01:04:53.700
Can you, uh, talk about, uh, dragon quest memories or something on topic?

01:04:53.700 --> 01:04:58.460
So yeah, I remember playing dragon warrior because that's how I remember it.

01:04:58.460 --> 01:05:02.180
And um, it was like one of the first games that I borrowed from a friend actually.

01:05:02.180 --> 01:05:06.020
Um, cause I, I don't know, it was just different.

01:05:06.020 --> 01:05:09.340
I think I remember seeing in like a Nintendo power or something, I was like, Oh, I got

01:05:09.340 --> 01:05:10.340
to try that.

01:05:10.340 --> 01:05:16.020
Um, I don't think I ever finished it unless I cheated with the game genie, but I don't

01:05:16.020 --> 01:05:17.980
think I ever finished the dragon warrior game.

01:05:17.980 --> 01:05:19.180
I think I gave up on them.

01:05:19.180 --> 01:05:20.740
I mean, you follow fancy though.

01:05:20.740 --> 01:05:22.020
I went through some of those.

01:05:22.020 --> 01:05:24.920
I did beat the original dragon warrior actually.

01:05:24.920 --> 01:05:27.380
And it was thanks to, uh, the, uh, guide.

01:05:27.380 --> 01:05:28.380
Oh yeah.

01:05:28.380 --> 01:05:29.380
Yeah.

01:05:29.380 --> 01:05:32.740
You got, remember Nintendo power, put out that guy to try to really get that, uh, series

01:05:32.740 --> 01:05:34.100
hyped out here.

01:05:34.100 --> 01:05:36.820
So now what are we going to trade?

01:05:36.820 --> 01:05:37.820
I don't know.

01:05:37.820 --> 01:05:38.820
I don't know.

01:05:38.820 --> 01:05:39.820
I think shinies.

01:05:39.820 --> 01:05:43.540
I want a shiny to go lucky and then I can, cause that'll guarantee that it'll be a high

01:05:43.540 --> 01:05:46.820
appraisal and then we can really, uh, amp it up.

01:05:46.820 --> 01:05:49.140
So I think that's, do you have shinies that are worth a damn?

01:05:49.140 --> 01:05:52.180
Uh, I mean, I don't really care about my shiny, so that's fine.

01:05:52.180 --> 01:05:53.180
All right.

01:05:53.180 --> 01:05:56.260
We'll have to look, we'll have to decide later, maybe during the break, uh, uh, later tonight

01:05:56.260 --> 01:05:57.260
we'll figure that out.

01:05:57.260 --> 01:05:59.140
But I'm excited for the dragon quest reimagines.

01:05:59.140 --> 01:06:01.100
I definitely want to pick up at least part one.

01:06:01.100 --> 01:06:05.660
I never really played part two or part three as much, but maybe I will.

01:06:05.660 --> 01:06:06.740
I'm not sure yet.

01:06:06.740 --> 01:06:11.660
The original dragon quest, $5, four 99, five bucks, excuse me.

01:06:11.660 --> 01:06:17.580
Dragon quest two will be six 49 drag quest three, 12 49, but a dragon quest three was

01:06:17.580 --> 01:06:19.960
a pretty beefy game if I remember right.

01:06:19.960 --> 01:06:22.020
So yeah, not too surprised.

01:06:22.020 --> 01:06:26.180
Uh, active says trade either a legendary or a shiny or a shiny legendary.

01:06:26.180 --> 01:06:27.180
Yeah.

01:06:27.180 --> 01:06:28.180
I don't know what Loki has available.

01:06:28.180 --> 01:06:36.620
Got a cast form, boo, uh, uh, Charmeleon shinies, gold duck, uh, magnum megalith.

01:06:36.620 --> 01:06:37.860
I don't know how to pronounce that thing.

01:06:37.860 --> 01:06:39.340
The weird like thing.

01:06:39.340 --> 01:06:40.340
And then a Venusaur.

01:06:40.340 --> 01:06:41.340
Okay.

01:06:41.340 --> 01:06:44.260
He's, he's looking pretty skimpy on the shiny, so we're gonna have to see if we can trade

01:06:44.260 --> 01:06:45.260
a legendary or something.

01:06:45.260 --> 01:06:46.260
We'll see.

01:06:46.260 --> 01:06:47.260
All right.

01:06:47.260 --> 01:06:48.260
Anyway, we'll figure that out later.

01:06:48.260 --> 01:06:49.500
That's fun that we went lucky though.

01:06:49.500 --> 01:06:51.500
Uh, let's move on.

01:06:51.500 --> 01:06:52.500
Next story.

01:06:52.500 --> 01:06:53.500
All right.

01:06:53.500 --> 01:07:03.340
Um, so Sony had purchased, uh, is insomniac games and you may remember insomniac games,

01:07:03.340 --> 01:07:08.340
um, also happened to put out a game aside from, you know, Spiderman and ratchet and

01:07:08.340 --> 01:07:13.980
clank a game on the Xbox, uh, one called sunset overdrive.

01:07:13.980 --> 01:07:20.060
And well now because of that purchase, you know, apparently Sony interactive entertainment

01:07:20.060 --> 01:07:25.980
does now hold the rights to, um, their past work, including sunset overdrive.

01:07:25.980 --> 01:07:33.100
So, but right now though, they don't have any sort of interest in working out an agreement

01:07:33.100 --> 01:07:38.420
to port sunset or sunset overdrive to the PlayStation four, but they are looking forward

01:07:38.420 --> 01:07:46.980
to future titles according to, um, Sony interactive entertainment president, uh, Shahey Yoshida.

01:07:46.980 --> 01:07:51.300
So that's unfortunate cause sunset overdrive, I thought was pretty cool.

01:07:51.300 --> 01:07:54.840
Um, I still haven't played it though, but it looked cool.

01:07:54.840 --> 01:08:01.180
Maybe we'll see a sequel to sunset overdrive come to, uh, the PlayStation four, much like

01:08:01.180 --> 01:08:04.980
we did with Titanfall where Titanfall one never made it to the PlayStation four, but

01:08:04.980 --> 01:08:06.180
Titanfall two did.

01:08:06.180 --> 01:08:10.980
So maybe there's hope in that sense if they decide to, um, do a new game.

01:08:10.980 --> 01:08:16.060
But I don't believe that the first game sold all that well, but that's never stopped people

01:08:16.140 --> 01:08:17.140
in the past.

01:08:17.140 --> 01:08:20.900
So we'll have to wait and see, I guess.

01:08:20.900 --> 01:08:21.900
Yeah.

01:08:21.900 --> 01:08:25.900
Um, I would be curious, uh, what Sony's going to do with this.

01:08:25.900 --> 01:08:28.820
I feel like a sequel might be a thing on PlayStation five.

01:08:28.820 --> 01:08:34.580
Like, you know, this game was kind of like cults hit enough that maybe they're gonna,

01:08:34.580 --> 01:08:40.340
you know, use this new acquisition to make it happen on PlayStation five to make some

01:08:40.340 --> 01:08:43.500
of those Xbox folks a little bit jealous.

01:08:43.500 --> 01:08:45.540
I mean, that's, that's what happens sometimes.

01:08:46.020 --> 01:08:47.780
I'm sure Microsoft's done the same thing to them.

01:08:47.780 --> 01:08:49.940
So yeah, it happens.

01:08:49.940 --> 01:08:52.060
So Dr. Sia says, yeah, I agree with Rob.

01:08:52.060 --> 01:08:54.020
I'm sure we'll see the next one on PlayStation five.

01:08:54.020 --> 01:08:55.020
Yeah.

01:08:55.020 --> 01:08:56.700
I kind of think that's the direction this stuff is headed into.

01:08:56.700 --> 01:08:58.380
So we'll see.

01:08:58.380 --> 01:09:02.460
Uh, going a little bit to retro game news.

01:09:02.460 --> 01:09:06.020
There's this new video that folks have been reporting on.

01:09:06.020 --> 01:09:11.380
Then I saw this, uh, over on Eurogamer ran a story on this whole thing that apparently

01:09:11.380 --> 01:09:16.500
they have done an analysis on the old video game street fighter two in the arcades.

01:09:16.500 --> 01:09:20.740
And as it turns out, if you felt that the computer was a dirty cheater when playing

01:09:20.740 --> 01:09:23.700
street fighter two, it turns out you were right.

01:09:23.700 --> 01:09:27.540
The computer does do some things that make it a dirty cheater.

01:09:27.540 --> 01:09:32.500
Uh, it was actually desk was the name of the, uh, street fighter player that put out the

01:09:32.500 --> 01:09:33.500
video.

01:09:33.500 --> 01:09:38.500
Uh, and it actually does like a frame by frame analysis to see how the computer can actually

01:09:38.500 --> 01:09:44.300
turn invisible or invisible, invincible that for a short moment to actually dodge some

01:09:44.300 --> 01:09:45.300
attacks basically.

01:09:45.300 --> 01:09:51.780
Uh, so the AI of the game will just turn invincible at some points, uh, to help block your tax.

01:09:51.780 --> 01:09:55.420
Uh, also the CPU can break out of dizziness.

01:09:55.420 --> 01:09:57.740
You remember when your character would get dizzy and street fire, you have to like mash

01:09:57.740 --> 01:09:59.140
all the buttons to snap out of it.

01:09:59.140 --> 01:10:00.140
Yeah.

01:10:00.140 --> 01:10:03.760
The computer just snaps out of it instantly, way faster than you would possibly be able

01:10:03.760 --> 01:10:04.760
to do.

01:10:04.760 --> 01:10:07.860
Uh, and then let's see, like, uh, the charge moves.

01:10:07.860 --> 01:10:10.100
Like let's say you want to do guile's flash kick, right?

01:10:10.100 --> 01:10:13.680
And where we had to have charged down and then hit up and kick in order to do the flash

01:10:13.680 --> 01:10:14.680
kick.

01:10:14.680 --> 01:10:15.680
Well, guess what?

01:10:15.680 --> 01:10:16.680
The computer doesn't have to charge.

01:10:16.680 --> 01:10:18.380
You can just do those moves whenever they want.

01:10:18.380 --> 01:10:25.060
So confirmed street fighter two is a dirty cheater, but here's, here's my kind of counterpoint

01:10:25.060 --> 01:10:27.360
to this whole thing.

01:10:27.360 --> 01:10:32.220
When you are, well for one counterpoint get good counterpoint one, get good bitch.

01:10:32.220 --> 01:10:37.620
No, uh, is that, uh, one arcade owners can kind of set the difficulty level of these

01:10:37.620 --> 01:10:41.460
machines so they can make, cause you know, some machines were harder than others and

01:10:41.460 --> 01:10:42.460
that's why.

01:10:42.460 --> 01:10:47.860
But also, um, this is, you know, when you do play on harder modes and video games, street

01:10:47.860 --> 01:10:51.140
fighter isn't the only one that cheats.

01:10:51.140 --> 01:10:54.300
It's some games will be more transparent about it than others.

01:10:54.300 --> 01:10:59.180
For example, let's take a game that's near and dear to my heart civilization, right?

01:10:59.180 --> 01:11:00.700
Or civ six, whatever.

01:11:00.700 --> 01:11:02.220
Pick, pick any game in the series.

01:11:02.220 --> 01:11:04.120
They all work the same way.

01:11:04.120 --> 01:11:08.000
When you play on the easiest level, something like Chieftain, and this is very transparent

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:13.500
in the game, but when you play on something like Chieftain, you basically are normal and

01:11:13.500 --> 01:11:17.780
the computer players get weakened by like 60% or maybe even half.

01:11:17.780 --> 01:11:21.000
I don't remember the exact percentage, but the computer players actually get weakened.

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:25.780
They get multipliers that work against them and actually, uh, being able to like conquer

01:11:25.780 --> 01:11:27.380
you and take over your territory.

01:11:27.380 --> 01:11:30.320
So it makes it a lot easier for you to win the game.

01:11:30.320 --> 01:11:34.880
Whereas if you play in the hardest mode of the game, guess what?

01:11:34.880 --> 01:11:36.160
It's reversed.

01:11:36.160 --> 01:11:39.340
Now you get multipliers that work against you.

01:11:39.340 --> 01:11:43.780
Whereas the computer is in kind of a, a more standard type of mode.

01:11:43.780 --> 01:11:47.300
So in a way, like even though I know we're kind of talking about like, Oh, street fighter

01:11:47.300 --> 01:11:50.300
two is a dirty cheater and there's videos and stories all about it.

01:11:50.300 --> 01:11:54.580
It's kind of like, I kind of feel in some way, this is just how difficulty works in

01:11:54.580 --> 01:11:55.580
video games.

01:11:55.580 --> 01:11:59.700
Sometimes it is some ways that they can do difficulties.

01:11:59.700 --> 01:12:04.820
It's hard to program difficulty in, you mean it's usually, you know, one of the easiest

01:12:04.820 --> 01:12:09.020
ways to do it is, you know, some sort of multiplier that you can adjust on the fly.

01:12:09.020 --> 01:12:13.260
Um, you know, you also have like stuff like Mario Kart where they will try to balance

01:12:13.260 --> 01:12:16.580
the game by, you know, the rubber band AI.

01:12:16.580 --> 01:12:22.000
So you know, whereas when they're further back, they go faster or they'll get stronger

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:23.580
power ups in the back.

01:12:24.300 --> 01:12:28.540
Great call out on super Mario Kart that especially, especially the original, I mean all the games

01:12:28.540 --> 01:12:32.500
have it, but you know, with the super Nintendo library now being on the switch, if you're

01:12:32.500 --> 01:12:37.220
a Nintendo online person, go back and play the original Mario Kart because it is very

01:12:37.220 --> 01:12:40.100
obvious in that game, very obvious in that game.

01:12:40.100 --> 01:12:44.940
And it's not even that they rubber band, it's that the characters will always finish in

01:12:44.940 --> 01:12:49.780
a certain order, like always, unless something really extreme happens.

01:12:49.820 --> 01:12:50.320
Yeah.

01:12:50.320 --> 01:12:53.660
Like there could be like, Oh, Hey, I just hit Donkey Kong, three different red shells

01:12:53.660 --> 01:12:56.660
and yet somehow he's up my ass with yet another red shell.

01:12:56.660 --> 01:12:57.660
Yeah.

01:12:57.660 --> 01:12:58.660
Uh, it's, it's crazy.

01:12:58.660 --> 01:12:59.660
Yeah.

01:12:59.660 --> 01:13:02.060
I would say Mario Kart's the dirtiest cheater game I've ever seen.

01:13:02.060 --> 01:13:05.700
It puts, it puts what we're talking about in street fighter to shame, uh, dark to see

01:13:05.700 --> 01:13:09.180
you says, I mean, I think we all kind of suspected, but it's nice.

01:13:09.180 --> 01:13:11.380
Someone went to the trouble to try and confirm that.

01:13:11.380 --> 01:13:14.640
And I think there's a lot of that kind of playing into the nostalgia of this story going

01:13:14.640 --> 01:13:19.420
around the game blogs and Twitter feeds and stuff this week is because it confirms what

01:13:19.460 --> 01:13:22.740
we all knew when we were 12 and now we're in our thirties, right?

01:13:22.740 --> 01:13:26.780
When we were 12, we're like, this game's a fucking cheater that computer, they fucking

01:13:26.780 --> 01:13:27.780
cheated.

01:13:27.780 --> 01:13:28.780
No, this stuff.

01:13:28.780 --> 01:13:29.780
Right.

01:13:29.780 --> 01:13:33.500
And now it's like, well, yes, they, they did in fact cheat and somebody brought the receipts

01:13:33.500 --> 01:13:34.500
to prove it.

01:13:34.500 --> 01:13:38.620
But, uh, I guess my point is, is that if you amp up the difficulty in video games, they

01:13:38.620 --> 01:13:39.900
all kind of cheat.

01:13:39.900 --> 01:13:40.900
And especially, yeah.

01:13:40.900 --> 01:13:42.500
In arcades, this is notorious.

01:13:42.500 --> 01:13:47.220
Um, let's see, act depth and chat says, isn't the arcade being tougher than they actually

01:13:47.220 --> 01:13:50.820
are common knowledge now, uh, especially with ticket spitters.

01:13:50.820 --> 01:13:51.820
Yeah.

01:13:51.820 --> 01:13:52.820
Especially depending on the arcade.

01:13:52.820 --> 01:13:57.820
Again, there are dip switches, what they're called, but they're basically switches inside

01:13:57.820 --> 01:13:58.820
the game.

01:13:58.820 --> 01:14:02.540
They, cause I think back in the day they really were physical switches, but obviously a lot

01:14:02.540 --> 01:14:06.220
of that went electronic over the years so that when you boot up the game, when you first

01:14:06.220 --> 01:14:09.900
plug it in for the first time, the arcade operator can set what difficulty they want

01:14:09.900 --> 01:14:11.100
the game to play on.

01:14:11.100 --> 01:14:15.060
So there were some arcades when you would go play something like street fighter and

01:14:15.060 --> 01:14:18.100
it, yes, it would be harder than it would be at other arcades.

01:14:18.100 --> 01:14:22.980
Um, especially depending on if the arcade operator knew how to set that or not.

01:14:22.980 --> 01:14:23.980
Right.

01:14:23.980 --> 01:14:28.140
Cause I'm sure you have some stories from Roosevelt golf land about messing with those

01:14:28.140 --> 01:14:29.380
switches in certain games.

01:14:29.380 --> 01:14:34.100
I don't mess with any of that stuff, but like, yeah, I know just from, you know, Mame and

01:14:34.100 --> 01:14:41.300
also accessing the operation like menu and stuff in like just my dance house revolution,

01:14:41.300 --> 01:14:47.400
you can set the difficulty on that if you want it or like you can, um, I mean, yeah,

01:14:47.400 --> 01:14:49.420
you can do it all, all sorts of stuff with that.

01:14:49.420 --> 01:14:53.620
Not even just Mame, but like if you were to play like an arcade collection, like let's

01:14:53.620 --> 01:14:56.900
say you're playing that and this is going to be random, but maybe that collection that

01:14:56.900 --> 01:14:59.820
had like magic sword and was it final fight?

01:14:59.820 --> 01:15:00.820
Yeah.

01:15:00.820 --> 01:15:01.820
Yeah.

01:15:01.820 --> 01:15:02.820
It was like, it was an awesome collection.

01:15:02.820 --> 01:15:05.940
It was on Xbox 360 cause I love magic sword, but you can go to the options menu and you

01:15:05.940 --> 01:15:08.380
can set how many points for an extra life.

01:15:08.380 --> 01:15:09.940
How many lives do you start with?

01:15:09.940 --> 01:15:13.900
Those were all dip switches that the arcade operator could set.

01:15:13.900 --> 01:15:18.140
Like at some arcades you would spend a lot more money to beat Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

01:15:18.140 --> 01:15:22.280
from start to finish than you would in others because of the switches.

01:15:22.280 --> 01:15:26.660
So anyway, uh, questmaster kind of confirming this in chat saying, yep, arcade operators

01:15:26.660 --> 01:15:27.980
can set difficulty.

01:15:27.980 --> 01:15:32.140
How many tokens are needed to continue or even if players are allowed to continue all

01:15:32.140 --> 01:15:37.180
the more help to squeeze just a few more quarters from players and dark to see it says that

01:15:37.180 --> 01:15:42.180
beat em up bundle that Capcom did has a lot of those options you can tweak to SSG100 Matt

01:15:42.180 --> 01:15:43.300
talking about pinball.

01:15:43.300 --> 01:15:49.460
Uh, there were places that raised pinball tables to make the ball fall faster.

01:15:49.460 --> 01:15:50.460
That's right.

01:15:50.460 --> 01:15:51.460
Pinball tables.

01:15:51.460 --> 01:15:52.960
Some people kind of mess with those as well.

01:15:52.960 --> 01:15:56.660
So interesting how those arcades worked at least back in the day.

01:15:56.660 --> 01:16:00.380
You probably see less of it now because no, you see it totally now cause you know what

01:16:00.380 --> 01:16:01.760
those tickets, you're right.

01:16:01.760 --> 01:16:04.880
Tickets, spitter, ticket, spitters, all those more traditional games because the ticket

01:16:04.880 --> 01:16:09.000
spitter games that you think are skill based where you have to time like, you know, hitting

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:10.600
a button or something like that.

01:16:10.600 --> 01:16:14.320
It's nice how there's artificial random lag in there sometimes.

01:16:14.320 --> 01:16:17.440
Funny how that works because it's on purpose.

01:16:17.440 --> 01:16:22.960
It's ensure to make sure they don't give the big prize away, but once every like 500 plays

01:16:22.960 --> 01:16:27.720
or something like that, whatever it's set to and those crazy, crazy sneaky, sneaky.

01:16:27.720 --> 01:16:28.720
All right.

01:16:28.720 --> 01:16:29.720
Anyway, let's move on.

01:16:29.720 --> 01:16:32.840
Um, some people would say this is sneaky, sneaky, another steam story tonight.

01:16:32.840 --> 01:16:33.840
Yeah.

01:16:33.840 --> 01:16:37.560
As we were talking about how the previous steam story, whereas if they were going to

01:16:37.560 --> 01:16:41.520
allow use game sales that could possibly hurt developers.

01:16:41.520 --> 01:16:46.920
Well, here's the real thing that already is hurting developers and that's the redesign

01:16:46.920 --> 01:16:50.080
to their discovery system that they have.

01:16:50.080 --> 01:16:54.560
So they have that big update where they've changed how, um, stuff is going to come into

01:16:54.560 --> 01:16:57.000
your feed, uh, different discovery stuff.

01:16:57.000 --> 01:17:02.800
And they found based on like, you know, sales and wishlist ads or whatever and deletions

01:17:03.240 --> 01:17:08.480
that the wishlist ads have gone down dramatically since they've implemented that.

01:17:08.480 --> 01:17:16.040
So there's a game for a game unbound worlds apart that was showing, you know, the trend

01:17:16.040 --> 01:17:24.040
in their steam wishlist ads and how once that, you know, once they September 10th hit, it's

01:17:24.040 --> 01:17:26.840
just straight down.

01:17:26.840 --> 01:17:28.320
So that is kind of blame.

01:17:28.320 --> 01:17:32.560
Um, there's another game, bright red skies, similar type of thing where September 11th

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:37.760
straight down, um, people stopped seeing their game says it was actually performing.

01:17:37.760 --> 01:17:45.040
Um, it dropped 66% and all time low yikes months, months of effort ruined in an instant.

01:17:45.040 --> 01:17:46.040
I forgot.

01:17:46.040 --> 01:17:50.240
I did notice that the steam store like redid stuff or is that because I'm in the beta?

01:17:50.240 --> 01:17:54.280
Like I got that new games library push that shows your games library all differently.

01:17:54.280 --> 01:17:55.280
Yeah.

01:17:55.280 --> 01:17:58.680
It might be to the beta cause I don't have it yet cause I have the beta version.

01:17:58.680 --> 01:17:59.680
Yeah.

01:17:59.680 --> 01:18:02.000
If you're, if you opt into the beta, you can see what it looks like now.

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:03.000
So that's interesting.

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:05.600
I, I honestly didn't spend a lot of time with it.

01:18:05.600 --> 01:18:06.600
You know, it's funny.

01:18:06.600 --> 01:18:10.160
I was only in there to uninstall games because I was running out of space in my primary drive

01:18:10.160 --> 01:18:12.880
and I've been trying to do some more video stuff, wink, wink.

01:18:12.880 --> 01:18:17.760
Um, so I need to clear up some space and I was like, why do I have some of these games

01:18:17.760 --> 01:18:18.760
installed?

01:18:18.760 --> 01:18:19.760
I'm literally never going to play.

01:18:19.760 --> 01:18:23.000
So I just had to go through and do uninstall and I was like, Oh, I got the new steam library

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:24.000
at some point.

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:25.000
Yeah.

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:29.280
So there's a lot of, a lot of different developers reaching out saying that they've kind of seen

01:18:29.280 --> 01:18:30.280
similar things.

01:18:30.280 --> 01:18:36.720
Um, their wish list has dropped 80%, um, another developer of the platform, a room fencer,

01:18:36.720 --> 01:18:43.360
um, Ilia and you know, what's unfortunate cause you know, you want those wish lists

01:18:43.360 --> 01:18:48.800
to be on there, especially pre-release of a game because then they're going to get notified

01:18:48.800 --> 01:18:52.760
when the game gets released or notified when the game goes on sales and you're trying to

01:18:52.760 --> 01:18:56.000
convert those wish lists into actual purchases.

01:18:56.880 --> 01:19:01.720
Um, it's kind of like a way to just, you know, help promote your discovery of your game.

01:19:01.720 --> 01:19:06.040
But being that they've redesigned how it works, it's fine.

01:19:06.040 --> 01:19:12.040
People are having trouble actually discovering those games as if that wasn't a problem before

01:19:12.040 --> 01:19:16.520
with so many games out in that platform.

01:19:16.520 --> 01:19:18.120
So I don't know what they're going to do.

01:19:18.120 --> 01:19:19.760
I guess continue to tweak it.

01:19:19.760 --> 01:19:25.800
Um, because it's basically their algorithm, but, um, you know, pays basically, I don't

01:19:25.800 --> 01:19:31.040
know, it's maybe over time it'll get better, but I don't know.

01:19:31.040 --> 01:19:34.240
It's hard to say steam's running into a lot of problems this week.

01:19:34.240 --> 01:19:39.120
I mean, between the, you know, thing going on in France and now this like, you know,

01:19:39.120 --> 01:19:43.080
and we were picking on steam a little bit, but, um, you know, maybe this story, not so

01:19:43.080 --> 01:19:46.440
much the Epic store, but you know, the, the, yeah, there's not enough on the Epic store

01:19:46.440 --> 01:19:47.920
to be able to not find it.

01:19:47.920 --> 01:19:48.920
Yeah.

01:19:48.920 --> 01:19:51.620
The first thing we were talking about with the France decision, you know, that could

01:19:51.620 --> 01:19:53.680
trickle down and affect other stores too.

01:19:53.680 --> 01:19:59.280
So a lot of the digital storefronts are having issues this week and you know, and it is interesting

01:19:59.280 --> 01:20:03.320
how big changes when it comes to discoverability can really trickle down.

01:20:03.320 --> 01:20:06.160
I know YouTube has kind of had a lot with this too, right?

01:20:06.160 --> 01:20:11.600
They need some changes, their discoverability algorithm to try to push back on some of the

01:20:11.600 --> 01:20:14.060
extremism we'll say that goes on on YouTube.

01:20:14.060 --> 01:20:17.000
And it's had this like ripple effect that's affected normal people.

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:18.000
They have that.

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:23.920
And they also had the thing where they were retooling how that you would, how you would

01:20:23.920 --> 01:20:27.920
get the, uh, verified tags on your account.

01:20:27.920 --> 01:20:34.860
So they said that that was supposed to combat channels that are impersonating other channels,

01:20:34.860 --> 01:20:37.960
but some of those channels that they were impersonating were verified.

01:20:37.960 --> 01:20:39.800
Now they're removing their verification tag.

01:20:39.800 --> 01:20:42.280
So how does that help again?

01:20:42.280 --> 01:20:44.520
It's just, it's stupid.

01:20:44.520 --> 01:20:48.640
Bobby Black Wolf in chat says devil's advocate steam is prioritizing games consumers can

01:20:48.640 --> 01:20:53.200
buy today because they can spend their money today.

01:20:53.200 --> 01:20:59.760
So steam is doing these today because you're, you're on the store ready to spend money,

01:20:59.760 --> 01:21:02.920
but you're not necessarily on the store spending money.

01:21:02.920 --> 01:21:06.120
Like I'm signing into steam and I go kind of browse and see what's there.

01:21:06.120 --> 01:21:08.160
I'm not like, Oh, I'm going to spend money today.

01:21:08.160 --> 01:21:10.160
It's just to see what's out there.

01:21:10.160 --> 01:21:14.920
Whereas you know, if this is going to be something that developers are aware of, it's going to

01:21:14.920 --> 01:21:19.720
make them less likely wanting to put their game on steam because they're like, Hey, Hmm,

01:21:19.720 --> 01:21:23.800
I could put it on Epic, which, you know, granted people are kind of, it has a stigma right

01:21:23.800 --> 01:21:30.000
now because it has less features, but there's less games on there and it's easier to discover

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:31.000
my game.

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:33.460
And I get a larger cut than I would with steam.

01:21:33.460 --> 01:21:38.720
So it's just another box ticked, I guess in Epic's favor in that sense.

01:21:38.720 --> 01:21:44.860
But I just think that there needs to be some ways to be able to discover that stuff.

01:21:44.860 --> 01:21:48.240
Like having some of those pre-release games or something like that, and then maybe their

01:21:48.240 --> 01:21:54.800
own section or maybe that, I don't know, you can say, Hey, I'm interested in finding out

01:21:54.800 --> 01:22:00.600
about these types of games and having to show that stuff, maybe cater to what you actually

01:22:00.600 --> 01:22:01.600
play.

01:22:01.600 --> 01:22:03.280
I don't know.

01:22:03.280 --> 01:22:07.840
Well, let's move on, uh, for time so we can get to the classic game of the week here.

01:22:07.840 --> 01:22:12.600
But first we have one more story for this half of the show talking about Xbox game pass

01:22:12.600 --> 01:22:16.240
and kind of how it ties into some additional rewards, because I think a lot of you guys

01:22:16.240 --> 01:22:19.640
out there probably heard about the whole, like you can kind of upgrade your regular

01:22:19.640 --> 01:22:22.760
Xbox live to the Xbox game passing for like a dollar, right?

01:22:22.760 --> 01:22:26.920
So I think a lot of you probably took advantage of that well, because you took advantage of

01:22:26.920 --> 01:22:27.920
that.

01:22:27.920 --> 01:22:29.160
You have access to this as well.

01:22:29.160 --> 01:22:32.080
There is a Microsoft reward point promotion going on right now.

01:22:32.080 --> 01:22:37.260
You can earn up to 10,000 reward points for every gamer score point that you get.

01:22:37.260 --> 01:22:39.040
You get one Microsoft for world point.

01:22:39.040 --> 01:22:42.260
So yeah, unlocking achievements right now you get reward points.

01:22:42.260 --> 01:22:43.260
So that's kind of interesting.

01:22:43.260 --> 01:22:44.260
Yeah.

01:22:44.260 --> 01:22:45.260
And there's other weird things.

01:22:45.260 --> 01:22:47.900
Well, I should, I shouldn't say weird, but there's other interesting kind of tie-ins

01:22:47.900 --> 01:22:48.900
with this too.

01:22:48.900 --> 01:22:53.900
Um, let's say like, I guess some of the points depends on what game you play.

01:22:53.900 --> 01:22:57.660
So like devil may cry five, you might get like a hundred points, but achievements in

01:22:57.660 --> 01:23:01.860
middle earth, shadow of war, middle earth, shadow of Mordor, you get 300 points.

01:23:01.860 --> 01:23:06.660
But I thought this was interesting too, is that if you play the Blair witch game, cause

01:23:06.660 --> 01:23:08.620
you know, that just came out on game pass, right?

01:23:08.620 --> 01:23:09.620
Yeah.

01:23:09.620 --> 01:23:13.020
If you play that, you get the Blair witch film.

01:23:13.020 --> 01:23:18.620
So you can relieve all that or re relieve, relive all that 1999 realness all over again.

01:23:18.620 --> 01:23:20.620
I, it probably doesn't hold up very well.

01:23:20.620 --> 01:23:24.060
And a lot of people probably watch that movie and think it's lame, but like, you have to

01:23:24.060 --> 01:23:28.540
remember when that movie first came out, it was, there was nothing like it like ever.

01:23:28.540 --> 01:23:31.500
And that movie literally scared the shit out of so many people.

01:23:31.500 --> 01:23:33.740
So, um, interesting.

01:23:33.740 --> 01:23:37.420
But I think that's kind of interesting that Microsoft's, you know, continuing to really

01:23:37.420 --> 01:23:42.140
push this game pass thing, you know, 10,000 Microsoft points, I think is the equivalent

01:23:42.140 --> 01:23:43.520
of like 10 bucks.

01:23:43.520 --> 01:23:47.700
So it's not like they're giving away the whole farm, but it's something, Hey, it's something

01:23:47.700 --> 01:23:48.700
for nothing.

01:23:48.700 --> 01:23:51.880
I mean, are you really doing nothing for game pass?

01:23:51.880 --> 01:23:57.420
Probably not, but it's still something a little bit of an added value, so, all right.

01:23:57.420 --> 01:24:00.860
So we are going to go to the classic game of the week.

01:24:00.860 --> 01:24:04.740
And before we jump right into the classic game of the week, I will say that during this

01:24:04.740 --> 01:24:08.980
segment, we're actually going to do the whole little Twitch giveaway for those of you that

01:24:08.980 --> 01:24:11.000
are watching live tonight.

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:16.920
If you contributed to the Twitch prime loot chest, we are about to give those away.

01:24:16.920 --> 01:24:21.740
There are 16 gifts in the chest of the Dauntless gunslinger.

01:24:21.740 --> 01:24:26.140
I don't even know what that is, but it's probably for some, Hey, it's for a game called Dauntless,

01:24:26.140 --> 01:24:27.900
apparently something for nothing.

01:24:27.900 --> 01:24:28.900
Remember that?

01:24:29.320 --> 01:24:34.260
I'm just going to theorize with that many gifts in the pot, probably all of you that

01:24:34.260 --> 01:24:36.860
are not on Twitch prime are about to get one.

01:24:36.860 --> 01:24:40.620
I mean, don't call me on that, but I can see how many people are watching and how many

01:24:40.620 --> 01:24:41.620
people are on prime.

01:24:41.620 --> 01:24:44.880
I'm thinking all of you are about to get a free something, something here.

01:24:44.880 --> 01:24:47.180
So please enjoy it.

01:24:47.180 --> 01:24:51.520
And thank you to everybody who put something into the gift basket.

01:24:51.520 --> 01:24:52.820
We really appreciate it.

01:24:52.820 --> 01:24:53.820
Oh, thank you, Shane.

01:24:53.820 --> 01:24:57.580
Dauntless is like a monster hunter clone, it seems, but I hear it's pretty decent.

01:24:57.580 --> 01:25:01.100
Well, maybe this code will be some incentive to go check it out, which is probably exactly

01:25:01.100 --> 01:25:03.300
what they want in giving this away.

01:25:03.300 --> 01:25:06.320
But we're going to check that out while we go to the classic game of the week.

01:25:06.320 --> 01:25:11.180
So for the classic game of the week tonight, Dark Sakura, she would usually do the classic

01:25:11.180 --> 01:25:15.120
game of the week, take a step down memory lane and pick a game out of the vault.

01:25:15.120 --> 01:25:18.480
But as you guys know, she has the night off while she's resting her voice.

01:25:18.480 --> 01:25:22.980
So we've been trying to invite some friends to come on the show and do this segment.

01:25:22.980 --> 01:25:25.980
Like we had what a VG realness was here a few months ago.

01:25:25.980 --> 01:25:30.900
The guys from Game Buoy have both been on, uh, what like Shane did one, of course, eating

01:25:30.900 --> 01:25:31.900
Pokemon, right?

01:25:31.900 --> 01:25:34.820
But you know, out of all the people like we've had on the show doing the guest segment, you

01:25:34.820 --> 01:25:41.380
know, we like haven't had on who the guy that has us on every single week at the end of

01:25:41.380 --> 01:25:42.640
his show.

01:25:42.640 --> 01:25:49.280
So it was probably about fucking time that we asked our pal Bobby Black Wolf to contribute

01:25:49.280 --> 01:25:51.220
to this week's classic game of the week.

01:25:51.220 --> 01:25:55.480
So after all of these years, Bobby Black Wolf, we're going to throw it over to you.

01:25:55.480 --> 01:26:00.440
Please tell us your selection for this week's classic game of the week.

01:26:00.440 --> 01:26:02.720
Hello all our, my name is Bobby Black Wolf.

01:26:02.720 --> 01:26:06.200
I have been doing podcasting for 14 years.

01:26:06.200 --> 01:26:11.060
Most of that leading up to all our, and they have never, ever asked me to do the classic

01:26:11.060 --> 01:26:12.060
game of the week.

01:26:12.060 --> 01:26:15.040
Probably because they were scared I was going to do halo, which has already been done as

01:26:15.040 --> 01:26:16.040
a class game of the week.

01:26:16.040 --> 01:26:21.000
So I think now I actually, it's safe for me to do a classic game of the week.

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:22.000
I can't do halo.

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:23.040
It's already been done.

01:26:23.040 --> 01:26:28.520
I can't do my little prank to, you know, subvert the rules and put halo in because halo's already

01:26:28.520 --> 01:26:29.520
in.

01:26:29.520 --> 01:26:30.520
So I'm not going to do that.

01:26:30.520 --> 01:26:31.520
So I'm actually going to do something that's more on brand.

01:26:31.520 --> 01:26:37.040
I've got my DOS machine from the nineties here running MS-DOS 622.

01:26:37.040 --> 01:26:43.640
I've got my Roland MT-32 turned on and hooked up so we can actually see some of these, see

01:26:43.640 --> 01:26:48.040
this game and hear the game the way it was supposed to be played and heard.

01:26:48.040 --> 01:26:56.120
And I'm looking forward to sharing this game with all of you and giving it the respect

01:26:56.120 --> 01:26:59.980
that I believe it deserves here on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:26:59.980 --> 01:27:03.340
So thank you very much for allowing me to do the classic game of the week.

01:27:03.340 --> 01:27:04.340
And that's right.

01:27:04.340 --> 01:27:11.200
It is Jones in the Fast Lane, a 1990 PC title for DOS.

01:27:11.200 --> 01:27:14.480
Also came out on CD-ROM in 1992 by Sierra On-Line.

01:27:14.480 --> 01:27:15.480
It's a board game.

01:27:15.480 --> 01:27:16.960
It's about keeping up with the Joneses.

01:27:16.960 --> 01:27:25.120
You want to get your life better in career, education, wealth, or happiness, or one of

01:27:25.120 --> 01:27:30.120
them, or all of them, and you're racing against Jones, a little cartoon Jones.

01:27:30.120 --> 01:27:31.120
It's a board game.

01:27:31.120 --> 01:27:35.920
You play as a little marble that goes and gets a job and has a life and does some boring

01:27:35.920 --> 01:27:45.440
stuff on the weekend and, hang on a second, hang on, I'm getting a text message.

01:27:45.440 --> 01:27:50.560
Dear Bobby, Jones in the Fast Lane has already been done as an O.L.R. classic game of the

01:27:50.560 --> 01:27:52.680
week.

01:27:52.680 --> 01:27:54.680
You cannot repeat.

01:27:54.680 --> 01:27:56.680
Oh.

01:27:56.680 --> 01:27:58.680
Okay.

01:27:58.680 --> 01:28:00.680
Um.

01:28:00.680 --> 01:28:08.680
I guess we'll have to do something different.

01:28:08.680 --> 01:28:11.640
Okay, okay, okay.

01:28:11.640 --> 01:28:12.640
So I got it now.

01:28:12.640 --> 01:28:14.800
I checked the wiki.

01:28:15.160 --> 01:28:20.760
I am not doing a game that has already been done, so I think we're good, so we're going

01:28:20.760 --> 01:28:23.800
to try game number two.

01:28:23.800 --> 01:28:25.520
I'm going to load it up right here.

01:28:25.520 --> 01:28:33.320
This was also a game that made a mark on me, and I thought this game, this was the future,

01:28:33.320 --> 01:28:37.160
like this was the best graphics was ever going to get.

01:28:37.160 --> 01:28:46.680
I thought this was going to be just the pinnacle of graphics and storytelling, and I was wrong

01:28:46.680 --> 01:28:50.040
a little bit, but it's by Dynamics.

01:28:50.040 --> 01:28:51.040
A subsidiary.

01:28:51.040 --> 01:28:52.040
It was part of the Sierra family.

01:28:52.040 --> 01:28:53.760
It really was.

01:28:53.760 --> 01:29:01.040
But this game came out on DOS, later on Sega CD actually, and it's one that I really enjoyed.

01:29:01.040 --> 01:29:04.520
It's called The Adventures of Willie Beamish.

01:29:04.520 --> 01:29:10.840
So it's a point-and-click adventure game about this kid who's going to be an esports superstar.

01:29:10.840 --> 01:29:20.440
Now esports wasn't a term back then, but he wanted to be an esports superstar winner.

01:29:20.440 --> 01:29:24.920
This was around the same time as the Super Mario Brothers 3 Nintendo Direct, which they

01:29:24.920 --> 01:29:27.080
released in theaters, called it The Wizard.

01:29:27.080 --> 01:29:28.760
So it's kind of like that.

01:29:28.760 --> 01:29:35.160
And so Willie Beamish is this kid who wants to be the Nintari champion.

01:29:35.160 --> 01:29:38.920
Yes, Nintari is what he plays.

01:29:38.920 --> 01:29:45.480
And it was all done with animators, like actual former Disney animators worked on all the

01:29:45.480 --> 01:29:51.720
graphics for this game, which is why when this came out in the early 90s, we were like,

01:29:51.720 --> 01:29:54.080
wow, this looks like a cartoon.

01:29:54.080 --> 01:29:59.880
Now obviously we look at it nowadays, and it doesn't look that much like a cartoon.

01:29:59.880 --> 01:30:02.480
It's very pixelated, and we're like, oh, that's nothing.

01:30:02.480 --> 01:30:07.240
That's like, you know, we have plug-and-play games that look better than this.

01:30:07.240 --> 01:30:15.440
But it really did have, it broke through a lot of stuff on this.

01:30:15.440 --> 01:30:24.080
So as we kind of go, as on the video here, we're going through the intro here.

01:30:24.080 --> 01:30:25.920
There were a couple of different aspects to this game.

01:30:25.920 --> 01:30:30.920
It was a traditional Sierra game, and there were many, many ways to fail.

01:30:30.920 --> 01:30:34.240
You could die in so many hilarious ways.

01:30:34.240 --> 01:30:38.920
But the game starts out that it's the last day of school at Carbunkle Elementary.

01:30:38.920 --> 01:30:42.080
And Principal Frick, these are all stereotypes, by the way.

01:30:42.080 --> 01:30:43.960
Everything's stereotypical.

01:30:43.960 --> 01:30:47.480
He's addressing the students at a farewell assembly, and he's going, blah, blah, blah,

01:30:47.480 --> 01:30:48.480
blah, blah, blah, blah.

01:30:48.480 --> 01:30:54.360
And of course, of course, Willy Beamish has a pet frog, because of course every kid in

01:30:54.360 --> 01:30:57.680
the 80s, late 80s, had a pet frog.

01:30:57.680 --> 01:31:04.880
And he's asleep in there, and the frog comes out, and he steals the toupee of the principal

01:31:04.880 --> 01:31:07.680
and embarrasses him in front of the entire class.

01:31:07.680 --> 01:31:08.680
Ha, ha, ha.

01:31:08.680 --> 01:31:09.920
Isn't that funny, ladies and gentlemen?

01:31:09.920 --> 01:31:12.240
Well, he goes to detention.

01:31:12.240 --> 01:31:14.900
He's after school detention, the last session.

01:31:14.900 --> 01:31:16.800
Of course, he's in there.

01:31:16.800 --> 01:31:20.420
And he's dreaming of eSports.

01:31:20.420 --> 01:31:24.200
He's dreaming of being an Evo, except it's called the Nintari Championship.

01:31:24.200 --> 01:31:27.420
They're sitting at a computer, but using a joystick.

01:31:27.420 --> 01:31:33.120
And I don't know if he's doing WASD or not, but he's going up against this other kid.

01:31:33.120 --> 01:31:35.560
And then he wakes up.

01:31:35.560 --> 01:31:41.920
He wakes up from the dream, and his teacher starts asking him questions.

01:31:41.920 --> 01:31:47.600
And of course, the teacher is this really old lady, note called Ms. Glass.

01:31:47.600 --> 01:31:49.760
No stereotypes whatsoever.

01:31:49.760 --> 01:31:55.760
Now, what I'm not showing you right here is the actual voice acting, because in the CD-ROM

01:31:55.760 --> 01:31:59.440
version and in the Sega CD version of this game, there is voice acting.

01:31:59.440 --> 01:32:04.560
I am playing on the floppy disk version, because it allows Roland MT-32 stuff.

01:32:04.560 --> 01:32:08.200
If you have the CD-ROM version, it does not allow you to use the Roland MT-32, so you

01:32:08.200 --> 01:32:09.840
don't get the better music.

01:32:09.880 --> 01:32:12.680
So this is really the best music, the game here.

01:32:24.680 --> 01:32:31.680
And so you're basically trying to get through and solve puzzles without continually dying.

01:32:31.680 --> 01:32:36.940
And you have a frog, like I said, named Horny, which, by the way, is a banned word on Twitch.

01:32:36.940 --> 01:32:39.480
You need to get moderator approval to say the name of the frog.

01:32:39.480 --> 01:32:42.840
That was fun, because I streamed this entire game on Twitch.

01:32:42.840 --> 01:32:47.840
Now one of the other things I do want to point out is that since this was a game of the 90s,

01:32:47.840 --> 01:32:49.880
it actually came with stuff in the box.

01:32:49.880 --> 01:32:56.080
So I actually got, and I still have my stickers here, of Willy Horny Leona, who was one of

01:32:56.080 --> 01:33:01.560
the bad guys, and then Monster Squad, which was the game in the bottom right-hand corner.

01:33:01.560 --> 01:33:04.660
That was technically the game they were playing.

01:33:04.660 --> 01:33:10.540
And I got a menu from the Pizzeria, which also doubles as the installation instructors

01:33:10.540 --> 01:33:12.380
on the back side of the menu.

01:33:12.380 --> 01:33:19.260
And then also, there was a little notebook, spiral notebook, that it would give you.

01:33:19.260 --> 01:33:24.600
That actually, it was top secret notebook, you were supposed to keep out or die, stop

01:33:24.600 --> 01:33:26.640
before it's too late, and you go through there.

01:33:26.640 --> 01:33:31.080
And it's basically, it's got little doodles, but it also has newspaper clippings of things

01:33:31.080 --> 01:33:32.200
going on in the town.

01:33:32.200 --> 01:33:36.800
And one of the things that they would do back in this time, and it was kind of copy protection,

01:33:36.800 --> 01:33:42.240
kind of not, but they would actually have things, so like in here, there's like an ad

01:33:42.240 --> 01:33:49.400
for a hypnosis course, where you actually need the contents of this ad to actually get

01:33:49.400 --> 01:33:50.440
past something.

01:33:50.440 --> 01:33:54.300
You actually need to put someone under hypnosis, and you need to select three words, and the

01:33:54.300 --> 01:33:56.660
three words are in this book.

01:33:56.660 --> 01:34:01.120
So that was, that's kind of some of the stuff they did a lot in the late 80s, early 90s,

01:34:01.120 --> 01:34:03.120
especially the early Sierra games.

01:34:03.120 --> 01:34:08.040
So I'm going to real quick go through and just show what the gameplay looks like once

01:34:08.040 --> 01:34:14.640
I get to the, I'm going to load a game from my Twitch feed.

01:34:14.640 --> 01:34:18.920
So I actually played this on Twitch, but this is kind of like, this was in Willy Beamish's

01:34:18.920 --> 01:34:24.480
home, so as you click and walk on things, he actually goes through hand-drawn animations,

01:34:24.480 --> 01:34:26.800
which was kind of a big deal in the 90s.

01:34:26.800 --> 01:34:33.260
And then, you know, you could talk to your dog and stuff.

01:34:33.260 --> 01:34:39.560
But it really looked like a cartoon, and that was what really made us all excited for it

01:34:39.560 --> 01:34:40.560
when it came out.

01:34:40.560 --> 01:34:42.720
And the game was okay.

01:34:42.720 --> 01:34:45.720
And I mean, it didn't win too many awards, but it was a lot better than a lot of the

01:34:45.720 --> 01:34:47.460
other ones.

01:34:47.460 --> 01:34:53.120
And there are some action elements in it as well.

01:34:53.120 --> 01:34:57.200
But there is a timer, so if you spend too long going around, you're actually going to

01:34:57.200 --> 01:35:03.220
get in trouble, because this game I loaded, I'm not in bed.

01:35:03.220 --> 01:35:07.600
So if I go all the way to cadet school on that trouble meter, which is a temperature

01:35:07.600 --> 01:35:14.240
gauge that basically rises, your mom's temperature rises, then the game ends, and you get sent

01:35:14.240 --> 01:35:15.240
to military school.

01:35:15.240 --> 01:35:17.900
So I'm going to go into Willy Beamish's room on this.

01:35:17.900 --> 01:35:23.040
So I'm upstairs in the house, and in his room, there's like, there's the Enterprise, I hang

01:35:23.040 --> 01:35:24.720
it on, he's got a lot of planes.

01:35:24.720 --> 01:35:27.280
It's a typical kid's room in the late 80s.

01:35:27.280 --> 01:35:32.040
Big pirate ship and stuff like that, but he's got a Nintari system, so we're going to play

01:35:32.040 --> 01:35:33.700
Nintari instead of going to bed.

01:35:33.700 --> 01:35:34.700
Why not?

01:35:34.700 --> 01:35:38.240
Because this shows the esports of 1989.

01:35:38.240 --> 01:35:41.700
So this is the game, they look like Battletoads.

01:35:41.700 --> 01:35:47.320
Like this is Battletoads coming in on the Nintari system, so this is the game that he's

01:35:47.320 --> 01:35:48.760
actually playing.

01:35:48.760 --> 01:35:52.000
The actual main characters, it's Monster Squad, they look like Battletoads, and then they

01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:53.540
play Mario Brothers.

01:35:53.540 --> 01:35:55.460
This was supposed to be esports.

01:35:55.460 --> 01:35:58.400
This was esports in 1989.

01:35:58.400 --> 01:36:01.360
I'm not actually playing it because this is not an action game.

01:36:01.360 --> 01:36:07.060
And he's, I'm playing, there's a cupcake, I don't know, I don't get it.

01:36:07.060 --> 01:36:13.440
So now I've practiced, and because I'm supposed to be in bed, well, you know, unfortunately,

01:36:13.440 --> 01:36:18.640
mom is now really upset, the temperature gauge has gone all the way up, and so I have just

01:36:18.640 --> 01:36:24.600
lost the game here live on OLR, because I'm now being sent to military school, getting

01:36:24.600 --> 01:36:32.380
a buzz cut, and they're all, that was it.

01:36:32.380 --> 01:36:38.440
And that's the end of the game, and that is the end of this classic Game of the Week segment.

01:36:38.440 --> 01:36:44.560
Like I said, it was out on PC, it came out for Sega CD as well, with diminished graphics,

01:36:44.560 --> 01:36:47.800
but it was an old CD-ROM game from 1993.

01:36:47.800 --> 01:36:51.480
The Adventures of Willie Beamish.

01:36:51.480 --> 01:36:52.480
Thanks OLR.

01:36:52.480 --> 01:36:59.800
Now let's go back to Studio N7 in Sacramento for the rest of the show.

01:36:59.800 --> 01:37:03.540
Thank you, Bobby Blackwell, for sharing that with us, that was a great video.

01:37:03.540 --> 01:37:08.380
If you are watching live here at Twitch TV, for the podcast folks, you didn't notice anything

01:37:08.380 --> 01:37:10.920
was wrong at all, because you could hear the segment wonderfully.

01:37:10.920 --> 01:37:16.000
Unfortunately for us live here on Sunday night, the video froze at one part, so I had to make

01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:21.760
a judgment call on the fly, because I can't actually have a video, I can't play right

01:37:21.760 --> 01:37:25.400
from the middle of a video when I'm using OBS and playing a video back.

01:37:25.400 --> 01:37:27.920
So I would have had to do the whole thing over again, which just would have been kind

01:37:27.920 --> 01:37:28.920
of weird.

01:37:28.920 --> 01:37:31.640
So I did just let it play through for the sake of the podcast.

01:37:31.640 --> 01:37:34.740
So what I'm gonna do for those of you that are watching here at Twitch TV, because Bobby

01:37:34.740 --> 01:37:38.240
did do a great job with that video, so I'm actually like, I'm a little pissed, like why

01:37:38.240 --> 01:37:40.720
can't it, why couldn't it do that with one of the B-roll things, where it's like not

01:37:40.720 --> 01:37:41.720
a big deal, right?

01:37:41.720 --> 01:37:44.160
But it does it on that video for whatever reason.

01:37:44.200 --> 01:37:47.440
I wonder if it was the audio, because it was when the audio kind of spiked, when I, so

01:37:47.440 --> 01:37:51.000
I don't know, like now I'm kind of like running through scenarios, why did this happen?

01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:55.000
So anyway, for those of you that are watching live, I'll replay that at the end of the show

01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:56.920
tonight, so hopefully you can kind of see that.

01:37:56.920 --> 01:38:00.280
And I think Bobby and I are talking behind the scenes, and it sounds like we might put

01:38:00.280 --> 01:38:03.400
it up on your YouTube so you guys can see that, because he did do a really good job

01:38:03.400 --> 01:38:07.080
with the segment, and Willy Beamish is, it's a fun game.

01:38:07.080 --> 01:38:10.500
That's a game I remember playing too, and I also played the floppy disk version, although

01:38:10.500 --> 01:38:15.740
I didn't have one of them fancy rolling cards, I had an AdLib card, which was still pretty

01:38:15.740 --> 01:38:16.740
awesome of the day.

01:38:16.740 --> 01:38:17.740
Did you ever play Willy Beamish?

01:38:17.740 --> 01:38:18.740
No.

01:38:18.740 --> 01:38:19.740
Really?

01:38:19.740 --> 01:38:20.740
I did not.

01:38:20.740 --> 01:38:23.420
It was such a, like, it was a great game, because it felt like-

01:38:23.420 --> 01:38:25.860
I am aware of it, I just don't know.

01:38:25.860 --> 01:38:29.500
The story about, you know, playing the video, it's like you, it's like you're playing

01:38:29.500 --> 01:38:30.500
a game about yourself.

01:38:30.500 --> 01:38:31.500
Yeah.

01:38:31.500 --> 01:38:34.940
And I'm sure that is exactly the way it was designed, was, you know, kind of like what

01:38:34.940 --> 01:38:37.620
they would be like as kids and so forth, so.

01:38:37.620 --> 01:38:42.620
Very good pick from Bobby Blackwell, I'm glad he didn't use his valuable segment to, like,

01:38:42.620 --> 01:38:46.220
pull a Halo joke or something, I'm just kidding.

01:38:46.220 --> 01:38:50.380
He did a great job, it took us way too long to work him into that segment, so I'm glad

01:38:50.380 --> 01:38:51.380
it all worked out.

01:38:51.380 --> 01:38:55.100
I just feel really bad that, like, now that he got on the show, his fucking video that

01:38:55.100 --> 01:38:58.300
he worked so hard on froze, but what can you do?

01:38:58.300 --> 01:39:01.500
Live radio, boys and girls, as I always say.

01:39:01.500 --> 01:39:07.020
Some other comments in chat, Dr. Sees says, the Jones and the Fast Lane bit had me going.

01:39:07.060 --> 01:39:08.060
Yeah, me too.

01:39:08.060 --> 01:39:12.260
I told him he could, I said, if you want to redo it, you can redo it, but I also said,

01:39:12.260 --> 01:39:15.580
you could also use this opportunity to pick a game that we're probably never going to

01:39:15.580 --> 01:39:18.820
pick otherwise, and so I think he did do the smart thing there.

01:39:18.820 --> 01:39:23.020
At least, at least Jones and the Fast Game is, Jones and the Fast Lane is in the list.

01:39:23.020 --> 01:39:25.500
Willie Beamish now is too, thanks to Bobby.

01:39:25.500 --> 01:39:29.980
As Joe and Hunter Matt says, I played it on Sega CD, I rented it because I couldn't rent

01:39:29.980 --> 01:39:32.500
the Jurassic Park Sega CD game.

01:39:32.500 --> 01:39:36.860
I totally forgot there was a Jurassic Park Sega CD game, that's awesome.

01:39:37.180 --> 01:39:39.660
All right, well, let's get back into some news.

01:39:39.660 --> 01:39:43.900
We're going to travel around and check out some news real quickly here in this rapid

01:39:43.900 --> 01:39:44.900
fire news segment.

01:39:44.900 --> 01:39:49.660
This is going to be like the third week we're talking about the Neo Geo arcade stick, and

01:39:49.660 --> 01:39:53.820
ironically enough, the joke that was made last week when we talked about, oh, what games

01:39:53.820 --> 01:39:54.820
are going to be?

01:39:54.820 --> 01:39:59.820
Was it all the King of Fighters and all the samurai showdowns and world hero games?

01:39:59.820 --> 01:40:01.540
Yeah, that's exactly what it is.

01:40:01.540 --> 01:40:03.700
So they announced the 20 games that are in there.

01:40:03.700 --> 01:40:08.420
So the King of Fighters, 95, 97, 98, 99, 2000, 2002.

01:40:08.420 --> 01:40:15.500
Fatal Fury Special, Fatal Fury 3, Garo, Mark of Wolves, Samurai Shodown 2, 3, 4, 5, The

01:40:15.500 --> 01:40:21.940
Art of Fighting, World Heroes 2, World Heroes 2 Jet, World Heroes Perfect, Ninja Masters,

01:40:21.940 --> 01:40:25.820
The Last Blade 2, and Kizuna Encounter.

01:40:25.820 --> 01:40:31.020
And those are your games that are going to be a part of that fighting stick that is not

01:40:31.020 --> 01:40:34.140
only a fighting stick for PC, but it also plugs into your TV.

01:40:34.140 --> 01:40:38.940
The fact that it also works on PC is pretty rad, actually.

01:40:38.940 --> 01:40:41.420
So like, I don't know, I'm on the fence.

01:40:41.420 --> 01:40:43.420
It's probably too much money.

01:40:43.420 --> 01:40:48.540
Yeah, I don't remember how much it costs, but I don't need a fighting stick.

01:40:48.540 --> 01:40:49.780
I don't need one that bad.

01:40:49.780 --> 01:40:50.780
So, alright.

01:40:50.780 --> 01:40:56.900
And then, well this is kind of funny, there is a patch to Borderlands 3 that apparently

01:40:56.900 --> 01:41:06.860
there was a problem where I guess one of the bosses in the game had some incessant screaming

01:41:06.860 --> 01:41:11.260
that was patched out now because apparently there was too much.

01:41:11.260 --> 01:41:17.060
And apparently, I don't know, so they had actually gone through the game.

01:41:17.060 --> 01:41:24.780
I don't want to actually spoil too much here, but apparently towards the end of the game

01:41:24.780 --> 01:41:32.500
one of the bosses, I guess, takes some damage and starts screaming and it's just, you know,

01:41:32.500 --> 01:41:37.300
apparently it just keeps on going and so they wanted to fix some other stuff that was in

01:41:37.300 --> 01:41:42.780
the game and with that they removed the pain sounds from Troy for his last boss fight because

01:41:42.780 --> 01:41:45.100
apparently it was very unpleasant.

01:41:45.100 --> 01:41:51.300
Well, I mean, if it was to the point where it was annoying, I can see, I mean I haven't

01:41:51.300 --> 01:41:56.620
played this game yet, so, although I've been making my way through the first Borderlands

01:41:56.620 --> 01:42:01.740
game, but it's just, of course, I put that down when all this other stuff came up, right?

01:42:01.740 --> 01:42:04.340
But I'm sure a lot of people were very annoyed by that.

01:42:04.340 --> 01:42:06.540
Anybody in chat, did you get this far in Borderlands 3?

01:42:06.540 --> 01:42:09.060
At the very end, so it's like the last boss fight.

01:42:09.060 --> 01:42:11.660
Probably nobody in our chat even was that far.

01:42:11.660 --> 01:42:17.020
Apparently, I guess, if you do any sort of stats effect on him, he just screams constantly,

01:42:17.020 --> 01:42:19.180
so that's actually kind of funny.

01:42:19.180 --> 01:42:24.340
I kind of wish they didn't patch it out, but what are you going to do?

01:42:24.340 --> 01:42:25.340
Yeah.

01:42:25.340 --> 01:42:26.340
All right.

01:42:26.340 --> 01:42:28.620
Well, moving on to some other stories.

01:42:28.620 --> 01:42:33.340
This one is about some trademarks by Bandai Namco, which Jason referenced at the top of

01:42:33.340 --> 01:42:35.220
the show tonight in the intro.

01:42:35.220 --> 01:42:36.780
I think this is really cool.

01:42:36.780 --> 01:42:37.780
So here's the thing.

01:42:37.780 --> 01:42:44.260
Some new trademarks were filed with some games in the Encore series for Bandai Namco.

01:42:44.260 --> 01:42:48.980
This is important because Bandai Namco already did this for a game in Japan.

01:42:48.980 --> 01:42:51.500
It was called Katamari Damacy Encore.

01:42:51.500 --> 01:42:55.460
It doesn't sound as familiar here to us because when they released it here, it was Katamari

01:42:55.460 --> 01:42:57.660
Damacy Reroll.

01:42:57.660 --> 01:43:01.740
There was also a puzzle game on the Nintendo Switch that was based on a Wii release.

01:43:01.740 --> 01:43:07.180
I don't think we had it here called Kotoba No Puzzle Moji Pitan Encore.

01:43:07.180 --> 01:43:10.940
So this Encore thing is something Bandai Namco has been doing.

01:43:10.940 --> 01:43:11.940
Guess what?

01:43:11.940 --> 01:43:15.100
There's more games apparently coming, thanks to these trademark filings.

01:43:15.100 --> 01:43:22.580
Mr. Driller, Klonoa, which I know will have people very excited, Splatterhouse.

01:43:22.580 --> 01:43:25.900
So that is all in a report that ran in Gamatsu.

01:43:25.900 --> 01:43:30.220
Apparently Mr. Driller W was specifically the game there in the Encore line.

01:43:30.220 --> 01:43:32.700
That was originally a WiiWare exclusive.

01:43:32.700 --> 01:43:42.760
And apparently Klonoa's 2009 remake, Door to Phantomile is going to be the other game

01:43:42.760 --> 01:43:46.280
potentially there in the Encore series.

01:43:46.280 --> 01:43:48.440
So that's kind of neat.

01:43:48.440 --> 01:43:49.820
We don't know about Splatterhouse.

01:43:49.820 --> 01:43:54.680
It could be the 2010 reboot that was on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360.

01:43:54.680 --> 01:43:56.380
Could be maybe the arcade version.

01:43:56.380 --> 01:43:57.380
Don't know.

01:43:57.380 --> 01:43:59.520
Hard to say at this point.

01:43:59.520 --> 01:44:05.080
I think it should just be a blend of both Splatterhouse and Katamari where you're just

01:44:05.080 --> 01:44:08.000
crushing things in violent gore.

01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:14.000
All right, let's talk about that game Control that came out that I really want to play.

01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:17.880
But Epic Games paid to have the exclusive rights on their store.

01:44:17.880 --> 01:44:20.820
I just saw this one in Discord as well.

01:44:20.820 --> 01:44:27.160
They paid about 9.49 million euros, which I think in Discord they had the American number

01:44:27.160 --> 01:44:34.000
of about 10.5 US dollars, I think, to actually get the PC exclusive rights to Control.

01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:38.640
This was paid out to Digital Brothers, which is the parent company, to 505 Games.

01:44:38.640 --> 01:44:43.680
According to a recent financial report, that's how they were able to find out that number

01:44:43.680 --> 01:44:46.960
because when you're a traded company, you have to publish reports to talk about your

01:44:46.960 --> 01:44:47.960
income.

01:44:47.960 --> 01:44:51.000
It just happened to be the timing of everything because the game hadn't released yet, but

01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:53.320
they had the report earnings from it.

01:44:53.320 --> 01:44:56.160
And so they're like, where did those earnings come from?

01:44:56.160 --> 01:44:59.920
Oh, it was from the exclusivity deal.

01:44:59.920 --> 01:45:01.360
Clever.

01:45:01.360 --> 01:45:02.360
Very clever.

01:45:02.440 --> 01:45:05.920
Now we know about how much Epic is willing to pony up for exclusive games.

01:45:05.920 --> 01:45:07.440
That's a nice chunk of change.

01:45:07.440 --> 01:45:11.440
Hey, Epic, I'm working on a game willing to make it exclusive.

01:45:11.440 --> 01:45:15.680
You have to throw me some people really waiting to play this, too.

01:45:15.680 --> 01:45:19.200
I'll take like a tenth of that.

01:45:19.200 --> 01:45:20.200
You can lowball me.

01:45:20.200 --> 01:45:21.200
It's fine.

01:45:21.200 --> 01:45:22.200
Reach for the sky.

01:45:22.200 --> 01:45:23.200
All right.

01:45:23.200 --> 01:45:27.000
Let's travel around and check out what's coming out in stores this week as we check out world

01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:28.000
release dates.

01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:29.000
All right.

01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:33.480
Baldur's Gate enhanced edition on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

01:45:33.480 --> 01:45:38.640
Baldur's Gate Siege of Dragonspear on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

01:45:38.640 --> 01:45:42.880
Baldur's Gate 2 enhanced edition also coming out on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and

01:45:42.880 --> 01:45:43.880
Xbox One.

01:45:43.880 --> 01:45:45.440
And I swear that's the last Baldur's Gate.

01:45:45.440 --> 01:45:51.320
Oh, well, maybe not actually, because then we get down to Icewind Dale enhanced edition.

01:45:51.320 --> 01:45:53.920
That's the Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

01:45:53.920 --> 01:45:58.640
Landscape Torment enhanced edition on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

01:45:58.640 --> 01:45:59.640
All right.

01:45:59.640 --> 01:46:01.600
I think we're good there.

01:46:01.600 --> 01:46:07.960
Contra Rogue Corps on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

01:46:07.960 --> 01:46:12.680
The Surge 2 on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

01:46:12.680 --> 01:46:17.520
Mario Kart Tour coming out of beta on iOS and Android this week.

01:46:17.520 --> 01:46:21.920
Darksiders 2 definitive edition on Nintendo Switch.

01:46:21.920 --> 01:46:25.360
I'm wearing a Mario Kart shirt, so I'll show that off.

01:46:25.360 --> 01:46:33.720
Gunvolt Chronicles Luminous Avenger that's coming out on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation

01:46:33.720 --> 01:46:35.680
4 and Xbox One.

01:46:35.680 --> 01:46:40.880
Ys IX on Monstrum Nox on PlayStation 4.

01:46:40.880 --> 01:46:44.560
Code Vein on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

01:46:44.560 --> 01:46:50.560
Dragon Quest, Dragon Quest II, Dragon Quest III and Dragon Quest XI S on Nintendo Switch

01:46:50.560 --> 01:46:51.560
this week.

01:46:51.560 --> 01:46:56.600
FIFA 20 on PC, Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

01:46:56.600 --> 01:47:02.080
Memoria on PC, Mac, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, Xbox One.

01:47:02.080 --> 01:47:04.800
Ori and the Blind Forest on Nintendo Switch.

01:47:04.800 --> 01:47:08.400
And last but not least, Tropico 6 on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

01:47:08.400 --> 01:47:09.400
That's it.

01:47:09.400 --> 01:47:10.400
Nice.

01:47:10.400 --> 01:47:11.400
All right.

01:47:11.400 --> 01:47:13.680
Traveling over to Japan and looking at the releases there.

01:47:13.680 --> 01:47:17.880
They're also getting Ys IX this week, which is probably the biggest deal in the list.

01:47:17.880 --> 01:47:18.880
But Ys IX.

01:47:18.880 --> 01:47:22.960
Some of you think it might be Ys, because it's Y-S, but it's Ys.

01:47:22.960 --> 01:47:27.280
So Ys IX, Monstrum Nox is out in Japan this week on the 26th.

01:47:27.280 --> 01:47:30.700
There's an Atelier game out this week too, Atelier Ryza, Ever Darkness and the Secret

01:47:30.700 --> 01:47:31.700
Hideout.

01:47:31.700 --> 01:47:35.680
That's an irregular premium and special collector's box, because they love the collectibles over

01:47:35.680 --> 01:47:37.040
there in Japan.

01:47:37.040 --> 01:47:41.920
Gunvolt Chronicles Luminous Avenger IX also out in Japan this week.

01:47:41.920 --> 01:47:45.640
MotoGP 19 gets a Japanese release this week as well.

01:47:45.640 --> 01:47:48.080
And oh, there's a limited edition for Ys IX as well.

01:47:48.080 --> 01:47:49.960
I didn't notice that at first.

01:47:49.960 --> 01:47:53.280
There's also Contra Rogue Core is out in Japan this week.

01:47:53.280 --> 01:47:56.840
MelKiss and I'm sorry, I love the name of this game.

01:47:56.840 --> 01:47:57.840
You ready?

01:47:57.840 --> 01:47:59.300
AmazingGrace.

01:47:59.300 --> 01:48:02.400
What color is your attribute?

01:48:02.400 --> 01:48:04.040
That's the name of the game, Loki.

01:48:04.040 --> 01:48:05.120
AmazingGrace.

01:48:05.120 --> 01:48:07.160
What color is your attribute?

01:48:07.160 --> 01:48:08.160
What would you say?

01:48:08.160 --> 01:48:10.520
What would you say is what color is your attribute, Loki?

01:48:10.520 --> 01:48:11.520
I don't know.

01:48:11.520 --> 01:48:12.520
What is that?

01:48:12.520 --> 01:48:13.520
Some sort of slang?

01:48:13.520 --> 01:48:14.520
Is that like...

01:48:14.520 --> 01:48:15.520
I don't know.

01:48:15.520 --> 01:48:23.920
Does your attribute match the drapes?

01:48:23.920 --> 01:48:27.120
Loki's jokes have officially killed me.

01:48:27.120 --> 01:48:30.480
All right, anyway.

01:48:30.480 --> 01:48:33.920
Judging from the box art for this game, I would think maybe it's pink, because they're

01:48:33.920 --> 01:48:35.960
all wearing little like...

01:48:35.960 --> 01:48:40.980
It's for anime girls, of course, all wearing these like pink suits on the cover of the

01:48:40.980 --> 01:48:41.980
game.

01:48:41.980 --> 01:48:42.980
And I don't know.

01:48:43.220 --> 01:48:45.340
Do you want to hear the description of AmazingGrace?

01:48:45.340 --> 01:48:46.660
What color is your attribute?

01:48:46.660 --> 01:48:47.660
Yes.

01:48:47.660 --> 01:48:51.840
Shu woke up in a snowy town with no recollection of his past.

01:48:51.840 --> 01:48:55.900
He thought it was a strange place with an antique feel of Europe in the Middle Ages

01:48:55.900 --> 01:48:58.220
and a deep appreciation of the arts.

01:48:58.220 --> 01:49:02.960
There was also a towering wall known as Aurora, which surrounded by the town and sealed it

01:49:02.960 --> 01:49:04.100
off from the outside.

01:49:04.100 --> 01:49:09.540
However, he was taken in by the townspeople and eventually attended St. Alia Academy and

01:49:09.540 --> 01:49:12.060
enjoyed his time with the other students there.

01:49:12.060 --> 01:49:17.740
However, this newfound happiness was snatched in an instant when a mysterious fire destroyed

01:49:17.740 --> 01:49:19.260
the town on Christmas Day.

01:49:19.260 --> 01:49:22.340
Well, that's a fucking bummer, isn't it?

01:49:22.340 --> 01:49:26.420
Yune loved the town more than anyone and vowed from the bottom of her heart to change the

01:49:26.420 --> 01:49:31.340
town's fate, turning back time to December the 2nd, the first day of Advent.

01:49:31.340 --> 01:49:33.420
Why did the disaster occur?

01:49:33.420 --> 01:49:37.620
Why did the town's fate remain unchanged no matter how many times they turned back time?

01:49:37.620 --> 01:49:41.980
Why were they able to turn back time in the first place?

01:49:41.980 --> 01:49:45.860
That description literally has nothing to do with the fucking title.

01:49:45.860 --> 01:49:47.060
What color is your attribute?

01:49:47.060 --> 01:49:48.600
The color of fire.

01:49:48.600 --> 01:49:53.180
And we have to stop it, I guess, is what's going on there.

01:49:53.180 --> 01:49:57.140
If I could turn back time.

01:49:57.140 --> 01:50:02.340
I'm sorry I asked.

01:50:02.340 --> 01:50:05.780
Going to the Nintendo Switch and checking out the releases there.

01:50:05.780 --> 01:50:12.980
Ninja Box is out this week, as well as Hakuyoki Shinkai is out this week, as well as Atley

01:50:12.980 --> 01:50:17.880
Arisa is also released there, and Gunvolt Chronicles Luminous Avenger.

01:50:17.880 --> 01:50:24.260
There's also a game called Disaster Report 4 Plus Summer Memories for the Nintendo Switch

01:50:24.260 --> 01:50:26.700
is also out this week.

01:50:26.700 --> 01:50:29.580
I want to say, I think that was on the Wii at one point.

01:50:29.580 --> 01:50:31.940
I had like the Disaster Report series.

01:50:31.940 --> 01:50:36.120
It does, because it is a plus game, so it wouldn't surprise me if it's like a reimagining

01:50:36.120 --> 01:50:37.120
of that series.

01:50:37.120 --> 01:50:38.260
I don't know.

01:50:38.260 --> 01:50:43.180
But anyhow, let's go over to Europe and see what the release dates are out there.

01:50:43.180 --> 01:50:52.480
Alright, so in Europe we've got a few things, starting off with Songbird Symphony.

01:50:52.480 --> 01:50:54.820
Let's see here.

01:50:54.820 --> 01:50:57.380
Why did they not seem to know what the date is?

01:50:57.380 --> 01:50:58.860
Oh, here we go.

01:50:58.860 --> 01:51:04.220
Contra Rogue Corps, that's coming out on PlayStation 4 and the Nintendo Switch.

01:51:04.220 --> 01:51:08.340
The Surge 2 on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

01:51:08.340 --> 01:51:13.740
We have FIFA 20, that's coming out on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

01:51:13.740 --> 01:51:17.900
Dead by Daylight on the Nintendo Switch.

01:51:17.900 --> 01:51:22.300
Darksiders II Definitive Edition, that's on the Switch.

01:51:22.300 --> 01:51:25.660
Telsiligrad, that's on the Switch.

01:51:25.660 --> 01:51:30.700
Dragon Quest XI Echoes of an Elusive Age on Nintendo Switch.

01:51:30.700 --> 01:51:35.820
FIFA 20, oh I said that again, but I guess they have a collector's edition coming out

01:51:35.820 --> 01:51:36.820
as well.

01:51:36.820 --> 01:51:42.740
Yes, the, what was it, the Definitive Edition or Champion's Edition.

01:51:42.740 --> 01:51:48.180
You know, more of the, what was it, Ultimate Team Card Packs Edition is what they really

01:51:48.180 --> 01:51:49.180
should call it.

01:51:50.060 --> 01:51:55.420
And then Tropico 6, we've got that coming out on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

01:51:55.420 --> 01:51:59.420
Code Vein on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

01:51:59.420 --> 01:52:01.700
And that is it.

01:52:01.700 --> 01:52:04.060
All right.

01:52:04.060 --> 01:52:05.500
Let's go to the mailbag.

01:52:05.500 --> 01:52:07.860
Every week we invite your emails.

01:52:07.860 --> 01:52:12.020
Participate at Orangeloungeradio.com is the place to send your emails.

01:52:12.020 --> 01:52:15.900
And we dive into the mailbag and read your emails here on the program.

01:52:15.900 --> 01:52:19.460
DarkSakura usually reads these emails, but since she isn't here specifically for the

01:52:19.460 --> 01:52:23.700
purpose of saving her voice, I suppose I will have to read them instead.

01:52:23.700 --> 01:52:28.700
So we have two emails in the mailbag this week, but this first one, Loki, uh oh, I think

01:52:28.700 --> 01:52:33.900
this is from the, uh, Wasterbaiting account again, because the first one is from The Virus

01:52:33.900 --> 01:52:34.900
Developer.

01:52:34.900 --> 01:52:35.900
Oh my gosh.

01:52:35.900 --> 01:52:40.220
And the subject is, my virus recorded you masturbating.

01:52:40.220 --> 01:52:41.580
No.

01:52:41.580 --> 01:52:43.620
I feel- Again?

01:52:43.620 --> 01:52:48.860
I feel sorry for your virus because nobody should have to be subjected to that.

01:52:48.860 --> 01:52:49.860
I'm trying to see what's actually-

01:52:49.860 --> 01:52:53.500
Like I'm seeking damages for you and harming my virus.

01:52:53.500 --> 01:52:57.180
Recently you visited one of the porn websites I attacked with my ex-plate.

01:52:57.180 --> 01:52:58.180
Oh my God.

01:52:58.180 --> 01:53:01.060
This, okay, this gets really serious.

01:53:01.060 --> 01:53:05.460
Like I, I wouldn't usually give spam emails the time of day.

01:53:05.460 --> 01:53:06.460
It's Worldcraft.

01:53:06.460 --> 01:53:09.340
There's, there's a tone in this email.

01:53:09.340 --> 01:53:10.340
World building is-

01:53:10.340 --> 01:53:11.700
No, wait, wait, here we go.

01:53:11.700 --> 01:53:15.020
So when you started watching videos, it executed payload on your device.

01:53:15.020 --> 01:53:17.480
So that's what you get for not sticking with the payload.

01:53:17.480 --> 01:53:19.820
Now it's on your device.

01:53:19.820 --> 01:53:23.740
As soon as I infected your device, it started to act like a remote desktop with full read-write

01:53:23.740 --> 01:53:24.740
access.

01:53:24.740 --> 01:53:29.340
Uh, your camera, my virus started recording your web browser and your camera every time

01:53:29.340 --> 01:53:31.980
you masturbated during the last two weeks.

01:53:31.980 --> 01:53:37.060
While my virus is not perfect.

01:53:37.060 --> 01:53:38.320
How humble they are.

01:53:38.320 --> 01:53:40.740
What a humble, what a humble virus.

01:53:40.740 --> 01:53:48.340
While my virus is not perfect, it managed to record six videos clearly showing you masturbating.

01:53:48.340 --> 01:53:54.700
Call me whatever you want, a criminal or a dick, but this is just my job.

01:53:54.700 --> 01:53:55.860
It's it's-

01:53:55.860 --> 01:53:59.580
I'm employed to make viruses that watch you masturbate.

01:53:59.580 --> 01:54:00.580
That's-

01:54:00.580 --> 01:54:06.180
Oh God, we got Rob masturbating on video again.

01:54:06.180 --> 01:54:07.660
Well, it's a living.

01:54:07.660 --> 01:54:10.420
Yours is waster baiting in and out.

01:54:10.420 --> 01:54:11.420
Okay.

01:54:11.420 --> 01:54:12.420
Yeah.

01:54:12.420 --> 01:54:15.900
SSG100 Matt says this storyline sounds better than what colors your attribute.

01:54:15.900 --> 01:54:17.860
Wait folks, it gets better.

01:54:17.860 --> 01:54:21.100
I'm just, I'm just reading an email in the box cause this shit gets crazy.

01:54:21.100 --> 01:54:22.100
You ready?

01:54:22.100 --> 01:54:24.700
Uh, call me what you want, a criminal or a dick, but this is just my job.

01:54:24.700 --> 01:54:31.380
I do this on a regular basis and I recorded hundreds of people, but you are special in

01:54:31.380 --> 01:54:33.740
all caps.

01:54:33.740 --> 01:54:35.420
You're special.

01:54:35.420 --> 01:54:36.620
Why?

01:54:36.620 --> 01:54:41.660
Because of the apparent and perverse videos you were watching while masturbating.

01:54:41.660 --> 01:54:43.060
You know what I mean?

01:54:43.060 --> 01:54:47.620
Now I am your master and you are my slave.

01:54:47.620 --> 01:54:49.420
This is just taking over.

01:54:49.420 --> 01:54:54.060
I did not consent to this role play virus, master Jesus.

01:54:54.060 --> 01:54:55.060
All right.

01:54:55.060 --> 01:54:56.060
Thank you.

01:54:56.060 --> 01:54:57.060
Oh yeah.

01:54:57.060 --> 01:55:03.740
I'm so happy we get raided by another esteemed podcast network while I'm in the middle of

01:55:03.740 --> 01:55:10.660
reading the spam email we got to our box that is threatening to spread our masturbating

01:55:10.660 --> 01:55:12.060
videos all over the internet.

01:55:12.060 --> 01:55:21.660
So come on, come on in, pull up a chair or as our emailer said, now I am your master.

01:55:21.660 --> 01:55:22.740
Let's see where were we at?

01:55:22.740 --> 01:55:24.300
Oh, let me ask you a question.

01:55:24.300 --> 01:55:25.900
The email continues.

01:55:25.900 --> 01:55:30.860
How would you feel if I uploaded a porn hub, all the videos with you masturbating and send

01:55:30.860 --> 01:55:36.300
the links to everyone on your contact list, including your family and business partners?

01:55:36.300 --> 01:55:37.860
You don't want me to do this, right?

01:55:37.860 --> 01:55:41.900
There is only one way you can stop me from exposing your fantasies.

01:55:41.900 --> 01:55:45.700
I talk about my fantasies very openly.

01:55:45.700 --> 01:55:46.700
You're on this program.

01:55:46.700 --> 01:55:47.700
Subscribe to PewDiePie.

01:55:47.700 --> 01:55:48.700
Ryan Reynolds.

01:55:48.700 --> 01:55:51.140
And actually we were not going to talk about that.

01:55:51.140 --> 01:55:52.740
Anyway, moving on.

01:55:52.740 --> 01:55:53.960
You have to pay.

01:55:53.960 --> 01:55:55.840
Let me be straightforward with you.

01:55:55.840 --> 01:55:57.580
You know what Bitcoin is, right?

01:55:57.580 --> 01:56:03.820
Buy $2,000 worth of Bitcoin and send to me immediately.

01:56:03.820 --> 01:56:07.120
You can buy Bitcoin in many places like blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, I'm not going to read

01:56:07.120 --> 01:56:08.120
these websites.

01:56:08.120 --> 01:56:12.900
I'm giving you three days to complete this payment after which I will start uploading

01:56:12.900 --> 01:56:15.140
and sending your masturbation videos.

01:56:15.140 --> 01:56:18.580
Just imagine your family and colleagues reaction to these videos.

01:56:18.580 --> 01:56:25.620
Save your life now.

01:56:25.620 --> 01:56:26.940
I have three days, huh?

01:56:27.300 --> 01:56:28.300
Well, guess what, y'all?

01:56:28.300 --> 01:56:31.420
That email was sent on Monday.

01:56:31.420 --> 01:56:33.340
Have fun on Pornhub.

01:56:33.340 --> 01:56:34.340
Sick bucks.

01:56:34.340 --> 01:56:35.340
All right.

01:56:35.340 --> 01:56:36.340
Let's get to the real email.

01:56:36.340 --> 01:56:40.020
By the way, welcome to all the new viewers here at Orange Town Studio.

01:56:40.020 --> 01:56:41.460
We're a video game podcast.

01:56:41.460 --> 01:56:42.460
Did you know that?

01:56:42.460 --> 01:56:44.880
We talk about video games once in a while.

01:56:44.880 --> 01:56:50.020
But then once in this blue moon, we get like the crazy masturbating email spammer thing

01:56:50.020 --> 01:56:51.020
here.

01:56:51.020 --> 01:56:52.020
All right.

01:56:52.020 --> 01:56:55.780
Anyway, moving on.

01:56:55.780 --> 01:56:58.540
I'm loving all the comments we're getting.

01:56:58.540 --> 01:57:03.660
Havoc978 says, this is literally more detailed than any versions of the email I've gotten.

01:57:03.660 --> 01:57:05.180
That's why I had to read it.

01:57:05.180 --> 01:57:09.020
It was much more like the urgency and the tone in that email.

01:57:09.020 --> 01:57:12.780
I was like, I have to like, this person has a message.

01:57:12.780 --> 01:57:14.820
It's their job, Loki.

01:57:14.820 --> 01:57:15.820
It's my job.

01:57:15.820 --> 01:57:17.180
It's a living.

01:57:17.180 --> 01:57:23.100
I've recorded hundreds of people, but you, you're special.

01:57:23.100 --> 01:57:26.100
WBin26 in chat says, spam them back.

01:57:26.100 --> 01:57:30.200
I just, I feel like you don't want to let them know that somebody's actually reading

01:57:30.200 --> 01:57:34.820
the emails live on the internet to a captive audience of dozens of people, because then

01:57:34.820 --> 01:57:36.400
they'll just invite to send me more.

01:57:36.400 --> 01:57:38.780
So I don't really want to do that.

01:57:38.780 --> 01:57:40.780
Pesalpaca says, that was beautiful.

01:57:40.780 --> 01:57:41.780
Thank you.

01:57:41.780 --> 01:57:48.140
Nicole0991 says, as a girl, I'm amused by the amount of these kinds of emails I've received.

01:57:48.140 --> 01:57:51.100
Will you notice the tone in that email had no gender?

01:57:51.100 --> 01:57:54.700
You know, gender is merely a suggestion in the year 2019.

01:57:54.700 --> 01:58:01.020
So the virus developer whose virus will record you masturbating cares not of what parts you're

01:58:01.020 --> 01:58:02.720
using to masturbate.

01:58:02.720 --> 01:58:05.580
They just want you to know it's their job.

01:58:05.580 --> 01:58:06.580
And that you're special.

01:58:06.580 --> 01:58:07.580
And that you're special.

01:58:07.580 --> 01:58:08.580
All right.

01:58:08.580 --> 01:58:11.740
Anyway, can we get to the real email?

01:58:11.740 --> 01:58:17.580
I guess now everybody in chat is like, all right, we have to talk about games.

01:58:17.580 --> 01:58:19.060
Pretty high bar you have to live up to.

01:58:19.060 --> 01:58:20.060
All right.

01:58:20.060 --> 01:58:21.060
Well, luckily it's Flaco Jones.

01:58:21.060 --> 01:58:22.060
Okay.

01:58:22.060 --> 01:58:27.140
And if anybody can follow up the virus master or whatever his name was, the Flaco Jones,

01:58:27.140 --> 01:58:28.140
I'm sure, sure can.

01:58:28.140 --> 01:58:29.140
So here we go.

01:58:29.140 --> 01:58:34.460
Hey, OLR, a couple of weeks ago, you mentioned a story about Konami bringing back globally

01:58:34.460 --> 01:58:39.020
known IPs and went on to discuss whether that could mean a new Metal Gear game or something

01:58:39.020 --> 01:58:40.780
big along those lines.

01:58:40.780 --> 01:58:44.480
Well fast forward to the Apple keynote from last week when they brought a rep from Konami

01:58:44.480 --> 01:58:49.100
on stage and what did they announce but a new Frogger game exclusive to the Apple Arcade

01:58:49.100 --> 01:58:53.140
service joy.

01:58:53.140 --> 01:58:57.380
I about died laughing in part because I thought of your discussion on the show the previous

01:58:57.380 --> 01:59:03.700
week where we were sitting here, you know, that's, that's what the virus guy got is he

01:59:03.700 --> 01:59:08.860
saw us here with our wank about, Ooh, it's going to be Castlevania or it could be something

01:59:08.860 --> 01:59:13.180
like the Winx Club coming back, but no, it's gotta be fucking Frogger.

01:59:13.180 --> 01:59:14.180
That's what that guy recorded.

01:59:14.180 --> 01:59:17.220
And you know how much I love when they have new Frogger announcements.

01:59:17.220 --> 01:59:18.220
I know.

01:59:18.220 --> 01:59:19.220
Weren't you excited about Frogger?

01:59:19.220 --> 01:59:20.220
Oh yeah.

01:59:20.220 --> 01:59:21.220
All right.

01:59:21.220 --> 01:59:26.500
Anyway, uh, let's see where was I did it, but also the last time Konami tried to bring

01:59:26.500 --> 01:59:30.920
back Frogger was when I worked there as a tester and the Frogger games they were making

01:59:30.920 --> 01:59:33.500
were complete garbage.

01:59:33.500 --> 01:59:34.500
Spoiler alert.

01:59:34.500 --> 01:59:38.660
Now, I haven't been on Apple Arcade myself, but if I'm to believe what my friends are

01:59:38.660 --> 01:59:42.140
saying about the new Frogger game, guess what?

01:59:42.140 --> 01:59:44.500
There's still garbage.

01:59:44.500 --> 01:59:46.900
How do you make, how do you make Frogger garbage?

01:59:46.900 --> 01:59:51.340
I mean, you, you have a game that like knocked it off, you know, in Crossy Roads.

01:59:51.340 --> 01:59:52.940
Do your kids play the Frogger games?

01:59:52.940 --> 01:59:54.260
Cause I bet they don't care.

01:59:54.260 --> 01:59:55.740
I think that's what it boils down to.

01:59:55.740 --> 01:59:58.220
They don't play Frogger at all, but they play Crossy Roads.

01:59:58.220 --> 01:59:59.220
Interesting.

01:59:59.220 --> 02:00:00.220
They love Crossy Roads.

02:00:00.220 --> 02:00:05.300
Well, I remember when they, when they redid Frogger on the PlayStation one, it was kind

02:00:05.300 --> 02:00:07.180
of like, Whoa, this is different.

02:00:07.180 --> 02:00:08.180
Right?

02:00:08.180 --> 02:00:10.180
Cause like Frogger in the arcade was kind of basic as hell.

02:00:10.180 --> 02:00:11.180
Right.

02:00:11.180 --> 02:00:12.180
It was just like, you know, don't get me wrong.

02:00:12.180 --> 02:00:13.180
It was a great game for what?

02:00:13.180 --> 02:00:14.420
1983 or whenever that came out.

02:00:14.420 --> 02:00:15.420
But you know, you're going to bloop, bloop, bloop.

02:00:15.940 --> 02:00:16.940
You're just going up to the top of the screen.

02:00:16.940 --> 02:00:17.940
It's kind of basic.

02:00:17.940 --> 02:00:18.940
Right.

02:00:18.940 --> 02:00:22.260
But like, then it was like, Holy shit on the PlayStation.

02:00:22.260 --> 02:00:27.500
Now Frogger can go four different directions and like the levels are like mazes and stuff.

02:00:27.500 --> 02:00:30.020
They're not like, it was kind of like a whole new thing.

02:00:30.020 --> 02:00:34.540
And when they sold oodles and oodles of that game, now Konami was like, Oh shit, we just

02:00:34.540 --> 02:00:35.960
found the formula for success.

02:00:35.960 --> 02:00:38.780
We have to repeat that formula every single time.

02:00:38.780 --> 02:00:43.060
And now here we are in the year 2019 and they're still making Frogger on the PlayStation one

02:00:43.060 --> 02:00:44.060
for Apple arcade.

02:00:45.060 --> 02:00:46.060
Better graphics.

02:00:46.060 --> 02:00:47.060
Yeah.

02:00:47.060 --> 02:00:48.060
Yeah.

02:00:48.060 --> 02:00:49.060
But apparently it doesn't run very well.

02:00:49.060 --> 02:00:50.060
It seems like it's very poorly.

02:00:50.060 --> 02:00:53.820
Apparently it was a highlight because they have the showed off during the keynote.

02:00:53.820 --> 02:00:57.700
Kaijuto in chat says, I want to combine Frogger with Grand Theft Auto.

02:00:57.700 --> 02:00:59.180
Well, you know what?

02:00:59.180 --> 02:01:05.980
Konami just, I don't think they understand this concept of like, you know, make it 2019

02:01:05.980 --> 02:01:08.540
Sonic two bonus level, but make it 2019.

02:01:08.540 --> 02:01:11.100
Like I just, I just don't see Konami able to do that.

02:01:11.100 --> 02:01:13.500
Frogger, but battle royale is pretty good.

02:01:13.940 --> 02:01:14.940
What?

02:01:14.940 --> 02:01:18.500
Frogger, but battle royale.

02:01:18.500 --> 02:01:19.940
How would you make Frogger royale?

02:01:19.940 --> 02:01:21.140
I don't know.

02:01:21.140 --> 02:01:24.220
One frog and 99 people driving a car.

02:01:24.220 --> 02:01:25.220
There.

02:01:25.220 --> 02:01:26.220
Okay.

02:01:26.220 --> 02:01:28.220
Maybe not battle royale.

02:01:28.220 --> 02:01:29.220
Okay.

02:01:29.220 --> 02:01:30.980
I like, I like where we're going with this.

02:01:30.980 --> 02:01:32.360
Let's game design.

02:01:32.360 --> 02:01:36.820
How about instead of the battle royale formula, how about the evolve formula?

02:01:36.820 --> 02:01:38.220
The four versus one, right?

02:01:38.220 --> 02:01:39.740
Cause those games are super in right now.

02:01:39.740 --> 02:01:40.740
Right?

02:01:40.740 --> 02:01:41.740
Dead by daylight.

02:01:41.740 --> 02:01:42.740
All that, all that shit's huge.

02:01:42.980 --> 02:01:48.900
So how about one person is the frog and the others are the cars and the other methods

02:01:48.900 --> 02:01:51.020
to try to kill Frogger.

02:01:51.020 --> 02:01:52.600
Would y'all play that game?

02:01:52.600 --> 02:01:53.860
Quick poll in chat.

02:01:53.860 --> 02:01:55.940
Would you play, what do we call the game?

02:01:55.940 --> 02:01:58.340
I don't know.

02:01:58.340 --> 02:02:01.360
Frogger survivor, Frogger survive.

02:02:01.360 --> 02:02:02.740
One word titles are in right now.

02:02:02.740 --> 02:02:03.740
Right?

02:02:03.740 --> 02:02:04.740
Frog, Frogger survive.

02:02:04.740 --> 02:02:05.940
Would you play frog survive?

02:02:05.940 --> 02:02:07.020
Let's see.

02:02:07.020 --> 02:02:08.020
Looking in chat.

02:02:08.020 --> 02:02:09.820
Havok978 says, ship it.

02:02:09.820 --> 02:02:11.320
Dr. Sia says, sure.

02:02:11.320 --> 02:02:13.280
Bobby Blackwool says, somebody should be an alligator.

02:02:13.280 --> 02:02:14.920
Well, you should get to pick.

02:02:14.920 --> 02:02:16.520
You should get, do you want to be the car?

02:02:16.520 --> 02:02:20.220
Do you want to be, uh, do you want to be one of those logs that sinks into the water every

02:02:20.220 --> 02:02:21.220
now and then?

02:02:21.220 --> 02:02:22.220
Uh, do you want to be an alligator?

02:02:22.220 --> 02:02:23.720
Like what do you want to do?

02:02:23.720 --> 02:02:29.520
Uh, Dr. Sia says, Frogger survive, but use the same survive from that metal gear solid

02:02:29.520 --> 02:02:30.520
spinoff.

02:02:30.520 --> 02:02:33.960
Oh, uh, quiet could be in it for no particular reason.

02:02:33.960 --> 02:02:39.520
Or frog dressed up like quiet.

02:02:39.520 --> 02:02:41.400
Let's reskin the whole thing.

02:02:41.400 --> 02:02:44.240
Yeah, well I got it.

02:02:44.240 --> 02:02:46.800
Like cause we can't really come up with a unique idea.

02:02:46.800 --> 02:02:52.800
Let's just take Melgasol five, we'll reskin it as Frogger and just rerelease that.

02:02:52.800 --> 02:02:56.240
Bobby Blackwool says, Norman Reedus is the frog.

02:02:56.240 --> 02:02:58.440
I like it.

02:02:58.440 --> 02:02:59.440
Okay.

02:02:59.440 --> 02:03:00.440
Uh, where were we?

02:03:00.440 --> 02:03:03.440
I was, this, this was a Flaco Jones email at one point.

02:03:03.440 --> 02:03:04.960
Um, Oh yes.

02:03:04.960 --> 02:03:07.360
Surprised you didn't bring this up on last week's show.

02:03:07.360 --> 02:03:10.400
There was a pretty packed news week, so it makes sense.

02:03:10.400 --> 02:03:14.120
Flaco, let me tell you a little bit about my thought process when I'm constructing the

02:03:14.120 --> 02:03:15.960
show role for orange launch radio.

02:03:15.960 --> 02:03:20.160
I see a story about Frogger and I think, Hmm, I really don't give a shit.

02:03:20.160 --> 02:03:22.920
And I move on to the next thing on the list.

02:03:22.920 --> 02:03:27.440
Now this week was a little bit of a slower news week, so it might've made the cut this

02:03:27.440 --> 02:03:30.520
week, but obviously, but you know what?

02:03:30.520 --> 02:03:33.160
We, we work for our listeners.

02:03:33.160 --> 02:03:37.240
So when you guys are saying, this is what you want to talk about Flaco is like, Hey,

02:03:37.240 --> 02:03:41.480
well then talk about Frogger and Anita, you would have never had Frogger survive.

02:03:41.480 --> 02:03:45.920
And this concept we're going to make millions off of if, which by the way, Konami, we own

02:03:45.920 --> 02:03:46.920
that idea.

02:03:46.920 --> 02:03:50.040
Now Frogger survive is ours and, uh, you patent pending, right?

02:03:50.040 --> 02:03:52.480
That's how you ensure patent pending.

02:03:52.480 --> 02:03:53.480
So there it is.

02:03:53.480 --> 02:03:54.480
All right.

02:03:54.480 --> 02:03:59.840
Uh, pod culture is says playing Frogger now it sucks.

02:03:59.840 --> 02:04:02.920
Bobby Blackwool says, Jeff Keeley is the girlfriend.

02:04:02.920 --> 02:04:03.920
Wasn't there?

02:04:03.920 --> 02:04:09.040
Was a lady frog that would sometimes be on the, the, or there was a lady frog on the

02:04:09.040 --> 02:04:10.940
log that you would pick up on your way.

02:04:10.940 --> 02:04:12.520
So yes, Jeff Keeley can be the lady frog.

02:04:12.520 --> 02:04:13.520
Uh, and that's true.

02:04:13.520 --> 02:04:17.040
And her mat says Nolan North as the voice of frog number one, you guys are doing really

02:04:17.040 --> 02:04:19.840
man Questbuster says Troy Baker is the red car.

02:04:19.840 --> 02:04:20.960
We're going to start a game company.

02:04:20.960 --> 02:04:21.960
You guys.

02:04:21.960 --> 02:04:22.960
All right.

02:04:22.960 --> 02:04:23.960
Where were we?

02:04:23.960 --> 02:04:24.960
Oh yes.

02:04:24.960 --> 02:04:25.960
Flaco's email.

02:04:25.960 --> 02:04:30.080
Um, that just really got me laughing and thinking about old times at Konami QA.

02:04:30.080 --> 02:04:32.160
Well, I hope we give you a laugh here too.

02:04:32.160 --> 02:04:33.680
Have a great rest of your stream.

02:04:33.680 --> 02:04:34.680
We'll try.

02:04:34.680 --> 02:04:35.680
Uh, thanks.

02:04:35.680 --> 02:04:36.680
Flaco Jones.

02:04:36.680 --> 02:04:37.680
PS.

02:04:37.680 --> 02:04:40.420
Here's the link to the keynote where the Konami brand manager comes on stage.

02:04:40.420 --> 02:04:43.760
It's just a short two minute clip and the game does not look great.

02:04:43.760 --> 02:04:44.760
Uh, yeah.

02:04:44.760 --> 02:04:47.880
One of my friends was talking about it online and I was like, yeah, I'm looking at it right

02:04:47.880 --> 02:04:52.980
now and it's like, it's sorry if I don't rip the video beforehand, I can't just put it

02:04:52.980 --> 02:04:53.980
on stream.

02:04:53.980 --> 02:04:57.960
So, um, for those of you guys that were joining us from the giant size team up rate, hello

02:04:57.960 --> 02:05:01.440
by the way, and welcome to orange launch radio here at the voice of geeks network.

02:05:02.160 --> 02:05:05.120
We're totally a show about video games and we take ourselves very seriously.

02:05:05.120 --> 02:05:08.160
This is a very fine craft that we do here, just so you know.

02:05:08.160 --> 02:05:12.760
Um, but also since we're very low budget operation, if I didn't grab the video before we started,

02:05:12.760 --> 02:05:13.760
then I can't put it on air.

02:05:13.760 --> 02:05:16.360
So, uh, and I forgot to grab this one tonight.

02:05:16.360 --> 02:05:17.360
So yeah.

02:05:17.360 --> 02:05:18.360
It looks really lame.

02:05:18.360 --> 02:05:19.360
Yeah.

02:05:19.360 --> 02:05:20.360
It does kind of look lame.

02:05:20.360 --> 02:05:21.360
That's all you need to know.

02:05:21.360 --> 02:05:22.360
It looks lame.

02:05:22.360 --> 02:05:23.360
All right.

02:05:23.360 --> 02:05:24.360
Uh, that's it for the emails.

02:05:24.360 --> 02:05:27.560
If you want to send us an email in a future week, participate at orange launch radio.com

02:05:27.560 --> 02:05:32.640
is the place to send your emails for consideration for reading here on air.

02:05:32.640 --> 02:05:34.320
Let's get to our next story.

02:05:34.320 --> 02:05:35.320
Loki.

02:05:35.320 --> 02:05:36.320
All right.

02:05:36.320 --> 02:05:39.200
I got to close my Frogger video here, which why is he eating jelly beans?

02:05:39.200 --> 02:05:41.980
It doesn't make any sense, whatever.

02:05:41.980 --> 02:05:45.300
So red dead online, apparently red dead online.

02:05:45.300 --> 02:05:50.140
There may be some teasing going on, um, regarding a possible update soon.

02:05:50.140 --> 02:05:56.320
So apparently people have been spotting whether it's part of a glitch or not, uh, NPCs that

02:05:56.320 --> 02:06:01.300
sort of look zombie like, um, they have like a screenshot.

02:06:01.300 --> 02:06:07.240
For example, this old woman who has clearly a zombie face and kind of dead eyes.

02:06:07.240 --> 02:06:14.600
Could this possibly be a hint at an undead nightmare type DLC or red dead online type

02:06:14.600 --> 02:06:17.160
of event that's going to go on?

02:06:17.160 --> 02:06:23.240
I'm guessing yes, because this is too obvious and too easy of an way for them to get money.

02:06:23.240 --> 02:06:27.600
So it makes sense that this is going to be a thing that they'll probably do, especially

02:06:27.600 --> 02:06:29.320
since Halloween is right around the corner.

02:06:29.320 --> 02:06:33.080
Now earlier in the show, we kind of talked about how some companies like EA are really,

02:06:33.080 --> 02:06:35.240
you know, nickel and timing the crap out of things.

02:06:35.240 --> 02:06:39.340
And you know, why aren't people just charging the real cost for games and so forth?

02:06:39.340 --> 02:06:43.280
But I feel like when it comes to like rock star in some ways, are you, where do you,

02:06:43.280 --> 02:06:44.600
how do you feel about this?

02:06:44.600 --> 02:06:52.480
Well, red dead, like I feel that they do kind of, they take the whole like online portion

02:06:52.520 --> 02:06:53.520
of it.

02:06:53.520 --> 02:06:57.120
So there are games as a service model for like the online, Grand Theft Auto online.

02:06:57.120 --> 02:07:02.880
There's tons of updates for it, but they do like nickel and dime stuff on there a ton.

02:07:02.880 --> 02:07:08.880
Like they're really trying to push those shark cards in red dead redemption to the red dead

02:07:08.880 --> 02:07:13.960
online, which I never actually played, but I heard enough of it where it's kind of even

02:07:13.960 --> 02:07:18.340
worse where they nickel and dime stuff in there, but they do a lot of content as well.

02:07:18.340 --> 02:07:25.060
So it's kind of, it's hard to say whether or not that's, you know, something that people

02:07:25.060 --> 02:07:29.700
are interested in, but I don't feel so cheated necessarily by Grand Theft Auto five and rather

02:07:29.700 --> 02:07:33.280
redemption too, because the single player campaigns for those are fucking amazing.

02:07:33.280 --> 02:07:37.100
Like they're just great games by themselves and you're getting that for $60.

02:07:37.100 --> 02:07:40.260
This online portion is above and beyond that.

02:07:40.260 --> 02:07:45.000
So that's kind of like, I could see them treating it like their DLC because they don't do single

02:07:45.000 --> 02:07:49.040
player DLC anymore for the Grand Theft Auto games or red dead redemption.

02:07:49.040 --> 02:07:52.040
It's all in online, which that's fine.

02:07:52.040 --> 02:07:55.400
That makes sense because you're, you know, hosting this whole other game.

02:07:55.400 --> 02:07:59.680
So you're like, okay with it because there's the single player, which is fully featured,

02:07:59.680 --> 02:08:00.680
fully functional for $60.

02:08:00.680 --> 02:08:05.160
But then like this multiplayer is like something extra, you know, to be fair to EA, that used

02:08:05.160 --> 02:08:08.000
to be the way it was when they first dipped their toe in all this stuff with like Mass

02:08:08.000 --> 02:08:11.840
Effect multiplayer, which I loved like, and even though Mass Effect multiplayer, when

02:08:11.840 --> 02:08:16.280
they put that in Mass Effect 3 got a lot of pushback and, and, um, you know, shit for

02:08:16.280 --> 02:08:19.720
just being a money grab or whatever they're calling it at the time, I actually kind of

02:08:19.720 --> 02:08:23.480
loved it because Mass Effect 3 as a standalone game was great.

02:08:23.480 --> 02:08:28.280
You know, I even liked it before they did all the patches, whatever fight me.

02:08:28.280 --> 02:08:32.560
But when they did the multiplayer stuff on top of that, like I really enjoyed that.

02:08:32.560 --> 02:08:35.840
And the loot box stuff didn't feel so mandatory.

02:08:35.840 --> 02:08:40.720
You really could grind your way to free loot boxes at a non obscene pace.

02:08:40.720 --> 02:08:43.120
Yeah. Like for example, like we want to go back to that server.

02:08:43.120 --> 02:08:46.200
We're talking about how like companies abuse stuff like that.

02:08:46.200 --> 02:08:54.560
Um, look at Activision where they pay walled a call of duty, um, modern warfare remastered

02:08:54.560 --> 02:08:59.480
behind having the purchase call of duty, infinite warfare.

02:08:59.480 --> 02:09:04.960
And on top of that, that it's a remaster you would think, oh, it's going to be remastered

02:09:04.960 --> 02:09:05.960
all the content in there.

02:09:05.960 --> 02:09:06.960
Additional things.

02:09:06.960 --> 02:09:07.960
No, no.

02:09:07.960 --> 02:09:12.040
The DLC pack that they had in call of duty four, they're going to resell that to you.

02:09:12.040 --> 02:09:15.880
Oh, and they're selling it to you for more than what it was originally in the original

02:09:15.880 --> 02:09:16.880
game.

02:09:16.880 --> 02:09:20.960
Oh, and we're adding loot boxes that no one ever wanted into the game as well.

02:09:20.960 --> 02:09:22.120
That is what I'm talking about.

02:09:22.120 --> 02:09:26.080
Like taking it to an extreme because they know they can get money and so they're going

02:09:26.080 --> 02:09:27.640
to get all of the money is what they want.

02:09:27.640 --> 02:09:28.640
All right.

02:09:28.640 --> 02:09:29.920
Just wanted to mention the other rockstar related.

02:09:29.920 --> 02:09:30.920
Yes.

02:09:30.920 --> 02:09:34.640
So I was going to say that they're also, cause this is also something that people really

02:09:34.640 --> 02:09:39.600
want is they're rolling out their own PC games launcher.

02:09:39.600 --> 02:09:42.240
Why, why do we need to do this?

02:09:42.240 --> 02:09:46.000
But apparently they have their own games launcher on PC.

02:09:46.000 --> 02:09:50.160
If you own any rockstar titles, you can launch them all in one place.

02:09:50.160 --> 02:09:54.680
I think these are more of the ones that you purchase actually through like their game.

02:09:54.680 --> 02:09:59.040
Like they have like my grand theft auto five copy for example, is not through steam.

02:09:59.040 --> 02:10:02.840
It's actually just through like, I don't even remember where it's through.

02:10:02.840 --> 02:10:04.640
I think it was a box copy in it.

02:10:04.640 --> 02:10:08.480
You redeem it through the rockstar social club, I want to say at one time.

02:10:08.480 --> 02:10:11.320
So I guess this is just a launcher that ties in with that.

02:10:11.320 --> 02:10:15.240
And apparently if you install the launcher, you can also claim a free copy of grand theft

02:10:15.240 --> 02:10:16.240
auto San Andreas.

02:10:16.240 --> 02:10:17.240
Oh wow.

02:10:17.240 --> 02:10:22.580
Um, so that's a good way to get me to install it on my computer, offer me a pretty solid

02:10:22.580 --> 02:10:23.580
free game.

02:10:23.580 --> 02:10:24.580
Yeah.

02:10:24.580 --> 02:10:30.000
I don't know if they're suggesting that, um, maybe that red dead redemption twos come into

02:10:30.000 --> 02:10:32.800
PC as well or what, but it's about that time.

02:10:32.800 --> 02:10:33.760
Right?

02:10:33.760 --> 02:10:36.760
Doesn't red dead, or I'm sorry, don't like rockstar games usually show up about a year

02:10:36.760 --> 02:10:37.760
later on PC.

02:10:37.760 --> 02:10:40.760
Um, sometimes I don't, they're less worried about the piracy.

02:10:40.760 --> 02:10:41.760
Yeah.

02:10:41.760 --> 02:10:46.680
I don't know if, I don't know if it was going to get that pirated, I guess it would, but

02:10:46.680 --> 02:10:49.720
I think times have changed with that kind of times have changed with that kind of stuff

02:10:49.720 --> 02:10:50.720
too.

02:10:50.720 --> 02:10:53.240
But for whatever reason, rockstar is still kind of on that pattern, but yeah, you can

02:10:53.240 --> 02:10:57.120
get this launcher, I guess if you want, I'm not gonna pick it up because I already have

02:10:57.120 --> 02:11:02.180
grand theft auto San Andreas on steam and I don't need another copy of it.

02:11:02.180 --> 02:11:07.900
And also because I have grand theft five standalone launcher and I honestly haven't played that

02:11:07.900 --> 02:11:08.900
in months.

02:11:08.900 --> 02:11:11.740
Is this a case of too many launchers out there available?

02:11:11.740 --> 02:11:14.980
It is, but I don't really get bent out of shape about that stuff so much.

02:11:14.980 --> 02:11:18.620
I mean, I just take them out of my like auto startup thing.

02:11:18.620 --> 02:11:22.260
Like I say, no, you can't start up unless I, so I just take them all out of my store.

02:11:22.260 --> 02:11:24.940
Like with Epic, like for example, like they've been offering free games.

02:11:24.940 --> 02:11:28.700
So like they have had like this week they have the Batman games free because of the

02:11:28.700 --> 02:11:31.280
whole tie in with the Fortnite stuff.

02:11:31.280 --> 02:11:36.760
So you can get the Lego Batman one, two and three and then Batman Arkham, the Arkham city

02:11:36.760 --> 02:11:41.380
night and asylum, I think all free as well.

02:11:41.380 --> 02:11:45.920
So I added those to my queue even though I have them already on other platforms and then

02:11:45.920 --> 02:11:50.920
my kid, I was like, Hey, I'm like, let's add Lego Batman because you may want to play that

02:11:50.920 --> 02:11:55.200
Sunday even if you don't, I didn't even think I put the Batman Arkham stuff in there too.

02:11:55.200 --> 02:11:56.200
Ah, you'll play it Sunday.

02:11:56.200 --> 02:11:57.200
It's fine.

02:11:57.200 --> 02:11:58.200
It's free.

02:11:58.200 --> 02:11:59.200
Put it in your library.

02:11:59.200 --> 02:12:00.560
Who cares if you don't want it, it doesn't matter.

02:12:00.840 --> 02:12:01.840
Let's put it in there.

02:12:01.840 --> 02:12:02.840
Well, funny you bring that up.

02:12:02.840 --> 02:12:03.840
Cause I think we're going to come back to that.

02:12:03.840 --> 02:12:04.840
Oh, sorry.

02:12:04.840 --> 02:12:05.840
I real stories.

02:12:05.840 --> 02:12:06.840
Oh, you're fine.

02:12:06.840 --> 02:12:07.840
It's spoiler alert.

02:12:07.840 --> 02:12:08.840
Oh my God.

02:12:08.840 --> 02:12:11.200
Anyway, I do want to read some comments in our chat over Twitch TV slash vog network,

02:12:11.200 --> 02:12:12.200
VOG network.

02:12:12.200 --> 02:12:16.520
Cause you just says I got a free copy of grand theft auto, San Andreas, San Andreas is worth

02:12:16.520 --> 02:12:17.520
it.

02:12:17.520 --> 02:12:20.680
If you want to see how they got the idea for grand theft auto five online grand theft auto

02:12:20.680 --> 02:12:25.320
San Andreas has an online mod that works a lot like GTA five online, but you can be a

02:12:25.320 --> 02:12:26.320
cop in it.

02:12:26.320 --> 02:12:27.320
It's dope.

02:12:27.320 --> 02:12:28.320
So yeah.

02:12:28.320 --> 02:12:29.320
Yeah.

02:12:29.320 --> 02:12:32.880
You see a lot of the roots of where the games is now in the early.

02:12:32.880 --> 02:12:33.880
Yeah.

02:12:33.880 --> 02:12:34.880
Don't get me wrong.

02:12:34.880 --> 02:12:37.320
I don't like what they've done necessarily with grand theft auto online and how like

02:12:37.320 --> 02:12:42.000
it's just such a money grab and same with red dead online.

02:12:42.000 --> 02:12:45.000
But with that said, I am there day one when grand theft auto six comes out.

02:12:45.000 --> 02:12:47.000
So I don't give a shit about any of that.

02:12:47.000 --> 02:12:48.000
All right.

02:12:48.000 --> 02:12:51.240
Well, speaking of going back to your roots, uh, this next story we're going to talk about

02:12:51.240 --> 02:12:56.320
is a music game story and our voiceover guy, Jason brought this to my attention cause I'm

02:12:56.320 --> 02:13:00.560
a little bit out of the loop on music game news these days, but this one does look pretty

02:13:00.560 --> 02:13:01.560
cool.

02:13:01.560 --> 02:13:02.560
I actually have video of it.

02:13:02.560 --> 02:13:03.560
You ready?

02:13:03.560 --> 02:13:05.600
I don't know if I, I don't know if I am pronouncing the name of this game, right?

02:13:05.600 --> 02:13:06.600
I'm sorry.

02:13:06.600 --> 02:13:07.600
I'm going to call it Waka.

02:13:07.600 --> 02:13:13.640
It's w a C. Well, I'm thinking Waka, Waka, you know, the old DDR, like Fossey bear Waka,

02:13:13.640 --> 02:13:14.640
Waka, Waka.

02:13:14.640 --> 02:13:18.240
I, I, yeah, I'm thinking it's Waka, but that's what, that's what I'm sticking to it, but

02:13:18.240 --> 02:13:19.240
here's what it looks like.

02:13:19.240 --> 02:13:22.000
Uh, for those of you that are watching on Twitch, for those of you that are on the podcast

02:13:22.000 --> 02:13:25.240
feed, uh, at least you can kind of hear what the game sounds like a little bit, but it's

02:13:25.240 --> 02:13:28.120
got a really neat little kind of neon look to it, huh?

02:13:28.120 --> 02:13:36.000
Uh, this is from red Alice's hardcore label, hardcore Tano C. This is the new arcade game.

02:13:36.000 --> 02:13:38.840
It is showing up at round ones around the world.

02:13:38.840 --> 02:13:42.560
Um, you might be able to find it at Sega arcades in Japan as well.

02:13:42.560 --> 02:13:48.240
Um, but, um, I don't think we really have to say I saw, um, someone had posted that

02:13:48.240 --> 02:13:52.760
there's, okay, there's a game very similar also has an old look like this because they

02:13:52.760 --> 02:13:55.560
had it at dragon con and I've seen it in arcades.

02:13:55.560 --> 02:13:58.960
So this is actually like the second, what they call, I love this washing machine looking

02:13:58.960 --> 02:13:59.960
game.

02:13:59.960 --> 02:14:03.120
Well, there was one that like they showed it was like a Dave and busters, I think in

02:14:03.120 --> 02:14:05.160
a run at park or something like that.

02:14:05.160 --> 02:14:06.160
Yeah.

02:14:06.160 --> 02:14:10.280
But look at this guy is wearing gloves when he plays, which actually considering how many

02:14:10.280 --> 02:14:13.880
people touch that machine and kids that pick their nose and probably put their hands all

02:14:13.880 --> 02:14:14.880
over the pretty lights.

02:14:14.880 --> 02:14:16.400
Um, I don't blame them at all.

02:14:16.400 --> 02:14:19.160
Um, but yeah, this, it looks fun, doesn't it?

02:14:19.160 --> 02:14:22.680
So for those watching on the, excuse me, listening on the podcast feed, basically these notes

02:14:22.680 --> 02:14:25.720
kind of go around the circle and the guy, it's like tempest the music game.

02:14:25.720 --> 02:14:26.720
Yeah.

02:14:26.720 --> 02:14:27.720
Oh my God.

02:14:27.720 --> 02:14:28.720
That's a great way to describe it.

02:14:28.720 --> 02:14:29.720
It's tempest the music game.

02:14:29.720 --> 02:14:30.720
That is exactly what it is.

02:14:30.720 --> 02:14:31.720
That's great.

02:14:31.720 --> 02:14:38.600
Um, man, I remember when red Alice was just like, we'd see just a BMS files back in, you

02:14:38.600 --> 02:14:46.400
know, the PC beat mania SIM days and now it's like spun off into like actual music games

02:14:46.400 --> 02:14:47.800
and crazy.

02:14:47.800 --> 02:14:52.400
As Jason describes this, uh, you tap and hold or swipe or draw.

02:14:52.400 --> 02:14:58.560
Um, and when you do that, you can swipe clockwise or counterclockwise, you swipe in, swipe out,

02:14:58.560 --> 02:15:04.880
uh, and all with a degree of accuracy from which, uh, you can go like not so great to

02:15:04.880 --> 02:15:05.880
really, really tight.

02:15:05.880 --> 02:15:08.440
Um, the entire ring is touch sensitive.

02:15:08.440 --> 02:15:12.420
So the top, the bottom everywhere, it's a very expressive game with lots of vocal Lloyd

02:15:12.420 --> 02:15:16.840
and Tano C songs as seen in other music games, some new to music game ones.

02:15:16.880 --> 02:15:21.720
And of course, Tano C artists exclusives, uh, Jason says it's a super fun game.

02:15:21.720 --> 02:15:28.480
And my, my is the name of the other game that's kind of like a, uh, a washing machine or dryer

02:15:28.480 --> 02:15:29.480
shape sort of thing.

02:15:29.480 --> 02:15:31.480
So yeah, it looks really fun.

02:15:31.480 --> 02:15:33.120
Like I just want to check that out.

02:15:33.120 --> 02:15:38.800
Uh, they opened like another round one, uh, the one in Hayward, I think I'm anticipating

02:15:38.800 --> 02:15:41.800
I'm like there, you know, on the windows or they don't have a window.

02:15:41.800 --> 02:15:43.800
There is the door.

02:15:44.760 --> 02:15:50.060
Um, some comments in our chat, uh, Shane says gloves are necessary for these types of games.

02:15:50.060 --> 02:15:51.680
Learn that the hard and painful way.

02:15:51.680 --> 02:15:53.400
When I was in Japan, good point.

02:15:53.400 --> 02:15:58.320
A lot more people probably go prepared to these types of arcades to like, you know,

02:15:58.320 --> 02:16:01.400
really like play and do well at these songs.

02:16:01.400 --> 02:16:05.120
And some people around one, when I've been to those arcades are, you know, they get into

02:16:05.120 --> 02:16:06.120
it, they're prepared.

02:16:06.120 --> 02:16:08.900
If they're playing DDR, they've got their, like, like they're going to the gym, they've

02:16:08.900 --> 02:16:13.200
got their water bottle and their little, you know, cloth to pat down all the sweat, which

02:16:13.200 --> 02:16:14.320
is a nice thing to do.

02:16:14.320 --> 02:16:15.800
That's just, it's a necessity.

02:16:15.800 --> 02:16:17.320
Yeah, it really is.

02:16:17.320 --> 02:16:21.320
So a dark to see it says, Oh yeah, a lot of the, my, my vids, uh, I've seen they wear

02:16:21.320 --> 02:16:22.320
gloves.

02:16:22.320 --> 02:16:23.960
Um, I hope I'm saying this name right.

02:16:23.960 --> 02:16:24.960
Sorry if I'm not.

02:16:24.960 --> 02:16:29.000
Thour six, six says, this guy makes it look easy, but maybe it's not.

02:16:29.000 --> 02:16:32.760
It's probably like a lot of music games where it's a learning curve, right?

02:16:32.760 --> 02:16:34.840
You get used to reading it more and more.

02:16:34.840 --> 02:16:38.680
The more you play, like imagine the first time you played dance, dance revolution, if

02:16:38.680 --> 02:16:41.760
you ever did play dance, dance revolution, you know, it's really like you would not

02:16:41.760 --> 02:16:44.260
be able to do the hardest songs in that game right off the bat.

02:16:44.260 --> 02:16:46.500
You've got to learn like, Oh, the arrow hit the top.

02:16:46.500 --> 02:16:49.080
You kind of are learning to read the note chart.

02:16:49.080 --> 02:16:53.800
And that game is similar to, it takes a lot of practice is basically what it boils down

02:16:53.800 --> 02:16:54.800
to.

02:16:54.800 --> 02:16:58.480
And I used to be good at games like we'd be in a two DX, but since I haven't played

02:16:58.480 --> 02:17:03.520
in so long, if I had to play them now, yikes, uh, that were also, we'll follow set up with

02:17:03.520 --> 02:17:04.520
another question.

02:17:04.520 --> 02:17:05.640
What happens when you goof?

02:17:05.640 --> 02:17:07.640
Usually you probably saw the combo ticking up there.

02:17:07.640 --> 02:17:10.080
Let me run the B roll again real quick here.

02:17:10.080 --> 02:17:15.280
You'll notice as the person plays, um, there's a combo that kind of ticks up as they are

02:17:15.280 --> 02:17:16.280
doing the notes.

02:17:16.280 --> 02:17:18.000
You can see it's like 10, 11, 12, 16, 19.

02:17:18.000 --> 02:17:19.920
So as they're hitting all the notes, this combo goes up.

02:17:19.920 --> 02:17:24.880
If this player were to screw up, that combo would break, which I mean, big deal, right?

02:17:24.880 --> 02:17:30.360
But if you mess up too many notes, usually the song will fail and you will, you know,

02:17:30.360 --> 02:17:31.360
you basically you lose.

02:17:31.360 --> 02:17:34.800
But I also like the little things that comes over the top bonus get and that whole type

02:17:34.800 --> 02:17:35.800
of thing.

02:17:35.800 --> 02:17:37.360
So a really cute how they have that whole thing.

02:17:37.640 --> 02:17:40.960
But of course if you want a high score, which is what this is all about, then you want to

02:17:40.960 --> 02:17:43.560
try to make sure you get the highest combo if possible.

02:17:43.560 --> 02:17:46.480
People really like to brag when they get full combos and things like that.

02:17:46.480 --> 02:17:47.480
Yeah.

02:17:47.480 --> 02:17:48.760
So that's what that's all about.

02:17:48.760 --> 02:17:50.560
So a Waka looks pretty cool.

02:17:50.560 --> 02:17:54.680
I can't wait to go to a round one and check this out for myself.

02:17:54.680 --> 02:17:57.680
Meanwhile, Loki, um, you alluded to this a little bit ago.

02:17:57.680 --> 02:17:58.680
Yeah.

02:17:58.680 --> 02:18:02.600
So as I mentioned, there's free stuff on Epic game store right now for Batman.

02:18:02.840 --> 02:18:08.520
Um, and of course all that stuff is tying in with a, um, I don't know if it's the new

02:18:08.520 --> 02:18:09.520
season.

02:18:09.520 --> 02:18:14.520
I assume it's a new season for Batman or a Fortnite that they're doing a crossover Batman

02:18:14.520 --> 02:18:21.440
right now, uh, through and from now through October 6th and you basically can buy different

02:18:21.440 --> 02:18:27.380
things including a cosmetics there from the comic book and movies.

02:18:27.380 --> 02:18:32.980
So they have, you can get a Cape, um, you can buy a Cape Crusader pack and also they've

02:18:32.980 --> 02:18:35.820
got different weapons, new gliders.

02:18:35.820 --> 02:18:41.700
Um, so some of the gear that they're going to offer, a grapple gun that allows you to

02:18:41.700 --> 02:18:50.200
be able to, uh, kind of, you know, fly through the air, the explosive batarangs and yeah.

02:18:50.200 --> 02:18:55.880
So they'll have those, uh, you can earn like a cat wing glider as well, Batman themed imagery

02:18:55.880 --> 02:18:57.220
and other fun stuff.

02:18:57.220 --> 02:19:02.180
So that's going on between now and this, uh, the six admittedly, I don't play a lot of

02:19:02.180 --> 02:19:04.340
Fortnite, but I really do like Batman stuff.

02:19:04.340 --> 02:19:05.860
So I almost kind of want to check it out.

02:19:05.860 --> 02:19:06.860
Is that weird?

02:19:06.860 --> 02:19:07.860
It's free.

02:19:07.860 --> 02:19:11.180
I picked it and I, you know, I picked up that Arkham trilogy on, uh, the Epic store too.

02:19:11.180 --> 02:19:14.060
I was like, dang, I was like, cause they, they were showing the little teaser and I

02:19:14.060 --> 02:19:16.300
was like, what are they going to, are they going to give away the whole trilogy?

02:19:16.300 --> 02:19:17.300
What are they giving away?

02:19:17.300 --> 02:19:20.820
And sure enough, they're giving away like a ton of Batman games, but to make hype for

02:19:20.820 --> 02:19:21.820
their Fortnite thing.

02:19:21.820 --> 02:19:22.820
Yeah.

02:19:22.820 --> 02:19:24.220
Trilogy and uh, the Lego stuff too.

02:19:24.220 --> 02:19:27.220
Wait, Fortnite's making oodles of cash for Epic.

02:19:27.220 --> 02:19:31.760
They can pay $10 million to have control, be exclusive, they can give away these Batman

02:19:31.760 --> 02:19:32.760
games.

02:19:32.760 --> 02:19:33.760
It's pretty crazy.

02:19:33.760 --> 02:19:34.760
Yeah.

02:19:34.760 --> 02:19:35.760
Oh no.

02:19:35.760 --> 02:19:36.760
Does it have all the DLC?

02:19:36.760 --> 02:19:38.220
Maybe that's another thing too.

02:19:38.220 --> 02:19:41.180
Sometimes they'll give away games, but you still have to buy the DLC or buy the extra

02:19:41.180 --> 02:19:42.180
stuff.

02:19:42.180 --> 02:19:43.180
I don't know.

02:19:43.180 --> 02:19:44.820
I don't know either, but it was, I think it was like the Arkham collection.

02:19:44.820 --> 02:19:46.600
So maybe it does have all the DLC in it.

02:19:46.600 --> 02:19:48.580
Maybe somebody in chat can clarify that for us over at TwitchTV.

02:19:48.580 --> 02:19:49.580
I mean I could look, I guess.

02:19:49.580 --> 02:19:51.940
FlashVog network if you've played, I don't know.

02:19:51.940 --> 02:19:56.500
Um, so, uh, but you mentioned the kids were checking out the Lego Batman stuff.

02:19:56.500 --> 02:20:00.980
Well, I just downloaded it for them cause they liked Lego Batman 2 at one point cause

02:20:00.980 --> 02:20:04.260
that was the one that was more open, like more open world.

02:20:04.260 --> 02:20:10.180
Um, so the, yeah, the Batman Arkham Asylum and Arkham City are the game of the year editions.

02:20:10.180 --> 02:20:14.180
Arkham Knight doesn't state that it's the game of the year edition, so I assume, I don't

02:20:14.180 --> 02:20:16.260
know if all the DLC is in that one.

02:20:16.260 --> 02:20:18.740
Um, same with the Lego Batman stuff.

02:20:18.740 --> 02:20:24.420
I don't know if DLC is in there, but I don't think, um, no, I don't want to install that.

02:20:24.420 --> 02:20:31.060
I don't, I do they, I mean, I assume they sell DLC on here, but like, I don't know.

02:20:31.060 --> 02:20:32.060
I'm sure they do too.

02:20:32.060 --> 02:20:34.060
Cause I, I, let me, let me find out.

02:20:34.060 --> 02:20:35.060
Let's see.

02:20:35.060 --> 02:20:38.140
Well actually, if you could do me a favor, can you pull up the next story for me?

02:20:38.140 --> 02:20:41.120
Cause it's on one of the sites that's not working on this browser over here.

02:20:41.120 --> 02:20:45.100
So I'm going to need you to help me out here in talking about it.

02:20:45.260 --> 02:20:49.220
The next story is about Contra Rogue Corps and I know one part of it is that they're

02:20:49.220 --> 02:20:53.980
going to be giving away, uh, basically DLC type stuff after launch, which is kind of

02:20:53.980 --> 02:20:54.980
similar.

02:20:54.980 --> 02:20:57.700
If I remember right, how like the bomber man reimagining did is that they had like, then

02:20:57.700 --> 02:21:01.420
you had like pyramid head bomber man and you had other characters that were available in

02:21:01.420 --> 02:21:04.780
the game after launch and you didn't have to like pay extra money for them.

02:21:04.780 --> 02:21:08.280
So that's always kind of nice, you know, especially amongst the ranting or raving we've been doing

02:21:08.280 --> 02:21:10.660
earlier in this show, it is really cool.

02:21:10.660 --> 02:21:14.540
And I think, you know, it goes a long way when we see a company really support a game

02:21:14.540 --> 02:21:16.660
after launch with extra additions.

02:21:16.660 --> 02:21:19.660
I think it's also part of the reason why Overwatch, you know, again, we talked about how Overwatch

02:21:19.660 --> 02:21:21.100
is a winning formula.

02:21:21.100 --> 02:21:26.260
What two years later, it's because they keep adding characters like Sigma, Batista or newer

02:21:26.260 --> 02:21:28.820
characters, you know, they're still adding this replay value.

02:21:28.820 --> 02:21:31.260
You don't have to buy these characters if you want the skins and you want the pretty

02:21:31.260 --> 02:21:35.660
characters, you know, or them looking their best, I suppose, uh, then yeah, you either

02:21:35.660 --> 02:21:41.060
have to play the lottery or, you know, essentially or, or buy more packs, but, uh, yeah.

02:21:41.060 --> 02:21:42.060
So anyway.

02:21:42.060 --> 02:21:45.900
For Contra there, the question was, well, why is it taking so long to come back?

02:21:45.900 --> 02:21:51.520
And so basically the answer to that was it was very hard to kick off the project just

02:21:51.520 --> 02:21:54.820
because we needed to find the right kind of momentum and timing.

02:21:54.820 --> 02:21:57.540
Obviously I really wanted to make another Contra game.

02:21:57.540 --> 02:21:59.020
I've been really pushing.

02:21:59.020 --> 02:22:02.660
I just couldn't find the right push and couldn't get the approval for such a project.

02:22:02.660 --> 02:22:04.980
Doesn't that, doesn't that, oh, couldn't get the approval.

02:22:04.980 --> 02:22:09.620
I was gonna say a lot of that just sounds like a really nice way of saying like, I wanted

02:22:09.620 --> 02:22:12.980
to do this 10 years ago, but Konami wouldn't let me cause they're bitches.

02:22:12.980 --> 02:22:18.260
Yeah, that's, I'm sorry, but I, this person's very nice and it's saying it in a very polite

02:22:18.260 --> 02:22:22.180
way, but that's kind of what I'm really reading into this is that you really want to do this

02:22:22.180 --> 02:22:25.400
a long time ago is that the timing didn't work out.

02:22:25.400 --> 02:22:28.700
Like that's what you're saying when you're gonna break up with somebody and they said,

02:22:28.700 --> 02:22:30.140
it's just not the right time.

02:22:30.140 --> 02:22:31.300
It's not a you thing.

02:22:31.300 --> 02:22:32.300
It's a me thing.

02:22:32.300 --> 02:22:33.300
Yeah.

02:22:33.300 --> 02:22:36.020
And then they said also one thing, one of the difficult things is finding the right

02:22:36.020 --> 02:22:40.860
team to work on such a game and even just the staff and resources we have at the time,

02:22:40.860 --> 02:22:46.060
but what really pushed forward with the project was one of the things that was very memorable

02:22:46.060 --> 02:22:50.500
to me was working on Contra games and I know the series well, so I figured who else would

02:22:50.500 --> 02:22:53.940
be worthy to create a new, the next Contra game and that's why I wanted to contribute

02:22:53.940 --> 02:22:58.380
all of my talent and history on the series to make it come to life.

02:22:58.380 --> 02:23:00.020
So that's pretty awesome.

02:23:00.020 --> 02:23:05.260
Um, and then of course they're saying that Rogue Corps is going to be getting free content

02:23:05.260 --> 02:23:06.940
after launch as well.

02:23:06.940 --> 02:23:11.580
So they talked about post launch stuff, including more missions and weapons and indicated that

02:23:11.580 --> 02:23:15.060
players will have the ability to go beyond the current level cap.

02:23:15.060 --> 02:23:16.260
There's levels in the game.

02:23:16.260 --> 02:23:17.260
That's weird.

02:23:17.260 --> 02:23:18.260
Um, yeah.

02:23:18.260 --> 02:23:23.740
And they said there's also going to be a season pass and it will feature four DLCs that are

02:23:23.740 --> 02:23:27.460
going to prize up skins and in game items.

02:23:27.460 --> 02:23:30.620
So there'll be a little mix of stuff that's free and stuff that's not free.

02:23:30.620 --> 02:23:33.060
I did not play the demo for this.

02:23:33.100 --> 02:23:36.340
Let me check out that demo cause apparently like I know Dr. C played it and some other

02:23:36.340 --> 02:23:38.580
people on my Twitter feed have said it's fun.

02:23:38.580 --> 02:23:42.920
Because like I don't think I want to get more Switch games right now cause my kids are fighting

02:23:42.920 --> 02:23:47.980
over it and also because I've still have to replace those analog sticks, which by the

02:23:47.980 --> 02:23:50.380
way, yes, I heard about this too.

02:23:50.380 --> 02:23:54.820
Um, I was going to mention because now that, you know, that Switch Lite came out, they're

02:23:54.820 --> 02:23:58.060
using the same fucking analog sticks on the Switch Lite and guess what?

02:23:58.060 --> 02:23:59.540
You can't replace on those.

02:23:59.540 --> 02:24:01.640
Yeah, that's smart Nintendo.

02:24:01.640 --> 02:24:04.120
That's going to be a problem that's going to bite you in the ass six months from now.

02:24:04.120 --> 02:24:05.120
Yeah.

02:24:05.120 --> 02:24:07.880
I have a feeling Nintendo is not going to think the best of that decision later on down

02:24:07.880 --> 02:24:08.880
the line, but we'll see.

02:24:08.880 --> 02:24:12.380
I mean, it's, it's all about what's going to happen a year from now and those things

02:24:12.380 --> 02:24:13.380
start breaking.

02:24:13.380 --> 02:24:16.600
Are they going to have another, you know, suit on their hands or whatever?

02:24:16.600 --> 02:24:19.240
That one's going to be even harder because you can't just send the controllers in.

02:24:19.240 --> 02:24:20.960
Whereas you may have spares for that.

02:24:20.960 --> 02:24:22.520
You got to send the whole damn system back.

02:24:22.520 --> 02:24:23.520
Yeah.

02:24:23.520 --> 02:24:24.520
Yeah.

02:24:24.520 --> 02:24:25.520
That'd be interesting.

02:24:25.520 --> 02:24:26.860
Anyway, uh, we're going to do just a couple of quick stories and then we're going to get

02:24:26.860 --> 02:24:31.120
to the listener round table, uh, via discord and chat.

02:24:31.120 --> 02:24:34.600
So if you want to actually call into our show live, you can use, have to be on our

02:24:34.600 --> 02:24:38.580
discord server over at vog network.com slash discord.

02:24:38.580 --> 02:24:39.580
We'll get you the invite.

02:24:39.580 --> 02:24:40.580
You need to get in there.

02:24:40.580 --> 02:24:44.800
And uh, if you go to the green room, you can hang out and uh, we'll pull some of you guys

02:24:44.800 --> 02:24:47.760
in to actually be on the show a little later on.

02:24:47.760 --> 02:24:50.620
All the information about that is right below on Twitch TV.

02:24:50.620 --> 02:24:53.920
If you're watching on your computer, all that is recap down below because I know we have

02:24:53.920 --> 02:24:55.920
some new viewers tonight.

02:24:55.920 --> 02:24:56.920
So thanks for that.

02:24:56.920 --> 02:25:00.040
Uh, if you wanted to call in and have your say you can, but if you want to just sit back

02:25:00.040 --> 02:25:01.440
and watch, you can do that too.

02:25:01.440 --> 02:25:04.200
We'll also take questions and other comments from our chat room.

02:25:04.200 --> 02:25:09.280
But first we have a few more stories for you guys, including, I think, uh, we were talking

02:25:09.280 --> 02:25:10.280
about blue rays earlier.

02:25:10.280 --> 02:25:13.800
This is one that some of y'all might want to get because I have to ask you a question

02:25:13.800 --> 02:25:14.800
though.

02:25:14.800 --> 02:25:19.560
Did you touch her breast?

02:25:19.560 --> 02:25:24.480
In case you don't pick out the reference, please provide 30 years ago before this clip

02:25:24.480 --> 02:25:25.480
ends up on Tumblr.

02:25:25.480 --> 02:25:31.680
30 years ago, a brilliant movie came out called the wizard, um, which, you know, how many

02:25:31.680 --> 02:25:33.680
of y'all saw it in theaters?

02:25:33.680 --> 02:25:34.920
That's on the drive in.

02:25:34.920 --> 02:25:39.400
Yeah, I didn't see a drive in, but my dad bless his heart, took me to go see it in the

02:25:39.400 --> 02:25:42.060
theater at the, at the, at the boobies is what they were.

02:25:42.060 --> 02:25:43.060
They were the domes.

02:25:43.060 --> 02:25:44.060
So we all call them the boobies.

02:25:44.060 --> 02:25:47.560
So he took me to the boobies to go see, uh, the wizard.

02:25:47.560 --> 02:25:48.560
Yes.

02:25:48.560 --> 02:25:50.040
So the wizard came out 30 years ago.

02:25:50.040 --> 02:25:51.040
They're having their anniversary.

02:25:51.040 --> 02:25:56.360
Um, coming, they have a 30th anniversary edition is coming out in blue Ray, uh, set the launch

02:25:56.360 --> 02:25:58.720
February, 2020.

02:25:58.720 --> 02:26:05.440
And don't know what special features are going to be on there, but it'll be so rad.

02:26:05.440 --> 02:26:07.400
You think we'd get something like deleted scenes?

02:26:07.400 --> 02:26:09.280
Maybe the power glove edition.

02:26:09.280 --> 02:26:10.280
Hmm.

02:26:10.280 --> 02:26:11.280
I don't know.

02:26:11.280 --> 02:26:15.560
Oh, wouldn't that be cool if the case was like a power glove type of thing?

02:26:15.560 --> 02:26:16.560
I don't know.

02:26:16.560 --> 02:26:17.560
Maybe there's some, probably not.

02:26:17.560 --> 02:26:19.000
There's still be trademarks and copyrights.

02:26:19.000 --> 02:26:20.000
Yeah.

02:26:20.000 --> 02:26:21.000
Maybe.

02:26:21.960 --> 02:26:24.640
But yeah, it, it was, it was such a big commercial for Nintendo products.

02:26:24.640 --> 02:26:29.120
It was, or as a saying in their chat room, uh, Bobby Blackwell says the super Mario brothers

02:26:29.120 --> 02:26:33.400
three and Nintendo direct orange right says the first Nintendo direct ever.

02:26:33.400 --> 02:26:34.400
Yeah.

02:26:34.400 --> 02:26:35.400
Pretty much pretty much.

02:26:35.400 --> 02:26:39.440
Uh, and Bobby is also saying, I saw it in theaters twice just to watch the super Mario

02:26:39.440 --> 02:26:40.440
brothers three portion.

02:26:40.440 --> 02:26:47.000
Again, I, I sat there, I brought a notepad to write down things to take notes about super

02:26:47.000 --> 02:26:48.000
Mario brothers three.

02:26:48.000 --> 02:26:49.000
Oh no.

02:26:49.000 --> 02:26:50.640
And a downer message from Bobby.

02:26:50.680 --> 02:26:54.800
I forgot about this sad that the guy who played Lucas became a registered sex offender.

02:26:54.800 --> 02:26:55.800
Oh yeah.

02:26:55.800 --> 02:26:56.800
I heard about that too.

02:26:56.800 --> 02:26:57.800
Thanks.

02:26:57.800 --> 02:27:04.000
I guess we solved that problem then of who it was that touched her breasts.

02:27:04.000 --> 02:27:06.720
I'm just, I don't want anything to do with that joke.

02:27:06.720 --> 02:27:09.320
I'm just gonna move right into the next story.

02:27:09.320 --> 02:27:11.040
Well, great, great.

02:27:11.040 --> 02:27:15.120
And then here's, here's the story I saved for last boil boy.

02:27:15.120 --> 02:27:18.120
This is a show that's going to generate some emails.

02:27:18.120 --> 02:27:25.400
Um, the, uh, headline here on VG 24 seven is over 1 million people have wanked off to

02:27:25.400 --> 02:27:28.620
border lands on porn hub during launch week.

02:27:28.620 --> 02:27:29.620
That's right.

02:27:29.620 --> 02:27:32.560
People are watching border lands porn on porn hub.

02:27:32.560 --> 02:27:37.440
A 1 million people search for border lands porn in five days.

02:27:37.440 --> 02:27:43.720
That's an increase of 12,905% of who is looking for border lands porn the day before.

02:27:43.720 --> 02:27:49.320
See that porn hub being the social savvy company that they are actually went out and

02:27:49.320 --> 02:27:53.520
made a graphic for what people are searching for.

02:27:53.520 --> 02:27:58.320
By the way, border lands five times more popular than Fortnite and three times more popular

02:27:58.320 --> 02:28:00.200
than overwatch.

02:28:00.200 --> 02:28:03.680
Would you like to hear some of the searches people have been doing on porn hub?

02:28:03.680 --> 02:28:04.680
Yes.

02:28:04.680 --> 02:28:10.520
Border lands three border lands, moxie, border lands, two border lands, hentai, border lands,

02:28:10.520 --> 02:28:15.760
Lilith, border lands, cosplay, border lands, and pretty much every character in the game,

02:28:15.760 --> 02:28:19.520
tales from the border lands and so on and so on.

02:28:19.520 --> 02:28:23.120
Porn hub actually wrote a blog post about it saying the most popular border land search

02:28:23.120 --> 02:28:28.640
is border lands three followed by border lands, moxie, a search demographic show that men

02:28:28.640 --> 02:28:36.720
are 84% more likely to search border lands than women and visitors age 18 to 24 are 119%

02:28:36.720 --> 02:28:41.240
more likely to search when compared to all other age groups.

02:28:41.240 --> 02:28:42.640
Fascinating.

02:28:42.640 --> 02:28:52.000
The people most likely to search for porn on Pandora are also likely to search for hentai.

02:28:52.000 --> 02:28:53.000
That's it.

02:28:53.000 --> 02:28:54.000
That's the tweet.

02:28:54.000 --> 02:28:56.720
People are searching for border lands porn on porn hub.

02:28:56.720 --> 02:28:57.720
Thanks, Valve.

02:28:57.720 --> 02:28:59.760
Why are you saying thanks, Valve?

02:28:59.760 --> 02:29:02.440
Because most of that shit was made with Valve's source filmmaker.

02:29:02.440 --> 02:29:03.440
Source filmmaker.

02:29:03.440 --> 02:29:06.080
You can't even buy the fucking game on Steam.

02:29:06.440 --> 02:29:10.560
No, but they use that for all sorts of like naughty videos.

02:29:10.560 --> 02:29:16.240
All your Overwatch shit, all your, you know, border lands stuff.

02:29:16.240 --> 02:29:17.240
Source filmmaker.

02:29:17.240 --> 02:29:21.800
Anyhow, I'm so glad we could end on that note.

02:29:21.800 --> 02:29:24.640
Maybe we'll see if there's last minute stories later on in the show.

02:29:24.640 --> 02:29:27.960
But it's that time of the show where we're going to take your calls and some of your

02:29:27.960 --> 02:29:28.960
questions from Discord.

02:29:28.960 --> 02:29:33.040
If you have any questions for us, you can put those in our Twitch channel right now.

02:29:33.040 --> 02:29:34.400
Twitch.tv slash vog network.

02:29:34.400 --> 02:29:38.040
But we actually do have a call waiting to come be on the show tonight.

02:29:38.040 --> 02:29:40.720
So let's go to the Discord server and say hello.

02:29:40.720 --> 02:29:41.720
You're on Orange Launch Radio.

02:29:41.720 --> 02:29:42.720
Who's this?

02:29:42.720 --> 02:29:43.720
It's Shane.

02:29:43.720 --> 02:29:44.720
Hey, Shane.

02:29:44.720 --> 02:29:45.720
It's good to hear from you.

02:29:45.720 --> 02:29:46.720
What's up?

02:29:46.720 --> 02:29:49.800
I wanted to talk about the best game of the year.

02:29:49.800 --> 02:29:50.800
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

02:29:50.800 --> 02:29:55.240
Before you do that, you have to tell the story about how you crossed state lines to capture

02:29:55.240 --> 02:29:56.240
Pokemon.

02:29:56.240 --> 02:29:57.560
Oh, okay.

02:29:57.560 --> 02:30:03.760
So we already heard the story of how Oshawa is my favorite Pokemon and is the best Pokemon

02:30:03.760 --> 02:30:08.640
how I wanted it and go like, I wanted as many as I could possibly get.

02:30:08.640 --> 02:30:14.920
So there weren't any easy ways around where I live to get one.

02:30:14.920 --> 02:30:21.000
But according to our local area group, there was one at a nest at a park about an hour

02:30:21.000 --> 02:30:24.160
away for like, cool, let's go get it.

02:30:24.160 --> 02:30:29.760
So we just typed the name of the park into GPS.

02:30:29.760 --> 02:30:36.720
And we just drove and when we got there, so, like, it was just this little town with a

02:30:36.720 --> 02:30:40.240
park and we're driving through this little town.

02:30:40.240 --> 02:30:47.560
And I saw, like a pot dispensary, I'm like, wait, Idaho doesn't have that.

02:30:47.560 --> 02:30:51.880
And then I started looking at the buildings and one of them said, like, the name of the

02:30:51.880 --> 02:30:52.880
city, Oregon.

02:30:52.880 --> 02:30:57.160
And I'm like, Oh, we went to a different state.

02:30:57.160 --> 02:31:01.240
So only you would kidnap oshawats and take them across state lines after

02:31:01.240 --> 02:31:04.240
Yeah, I only got five.

02:31:04.240 --> 02:31:06.480
So I didn't take I didn't kidnap a whole bunch.

02:31:06.480 --> 02:31:12.080
Yeah, that that nest that I basically helped you cheat to get in Elk Grove was kind of

02:31:12.080 --> 02:31:14.000
better even though it's kind of slow like that.

02:31:14.000 --> 02:31:18.920
Well, you know that park right for the I guess yeah, because for the listeners, yeah, I used

02:31:18.920 --> 02:31:20.240
to hunt there.

02:31:20.240 --> 02:31:24.800
This park is like four, but was some like there was like two stops there that were new

02:31:24.800 --> 02:31:25.800
to you.

02:31:25.800 --> 02:31:27.240
So there's clearly added things.

02:31:27.240 --> 02:31:32.320
But anyway, this is one of those like sports parks is like four baseball diamonds big.

02:31:32.320 --> 02:31:35.240
And you have to like walk around the mall to get all the stops.

02:31:35.240 --> 02:31:36.240
It's crazy big.

02:31:36.240 --> 02:31:37.240
So yeah.

02:31:37.240 --> 02:31:38.240
All right.

02:31:38.240 --> 02:31:41.600
What do you really want to call in about tonight?

02:31:41.600 --> 02:31:47.760
The best game of the year untitled goose game.

02:31:47.760 --> 02:31:48.760
Untitled goose game.

02:31:48.760 --> 02:31:50.160
Just waiting for you to pull it up.

02:31:50.160 --> 02:31:51.160
There it is.

02:31:51.160 --> 02:31:52.160
Okay.

02:31:52.160 --> 02:31:53.160
There.

02:31:53.160 --> 02:31:54.160
There's a shame trust that I'm on it.

02:31:54.160 --> 02:31:55.160
Yes.

02:31:55.160 --> 02:31:56.160
Uh huh.

02:31:56.160 --> 02:32:01.040
Um, so I bought this game, not knowing anything about it, except that you were a goose.

02:32:01.040 --> 02:32:03.200
And I was like, well, that's really enough for me.

02:32:03.200 --> 02:32:06.720
I don't really need much more information than that.

02:32:06.720 --> 02:32:15.640
And what I got was a hilarious puzzle stealth game that I laughed so hard playing it.

02:32:15.640 --> 02:32:21.520
I don't remember playing a game where I laughed this hard in a long, long time.

02:32:21.520 --> 02:32:22.520
Random ass segment.

02:32:22.520 --> 02:32:25.360
We're watching on the Twitch feed right now.

02:32:25.360 --> 02:32:29.240
The goose like honked at this guy until he fell over and his glasses fell off.

02:32:29.240 --> 02:32:32.440
The goose went over, picked up the glasses and ran away like a little bitch.

02:32:32.440 --> 02:32:33.440
Yeah.

02:32:33.440 --> 02:32:34.440
No.

02:32:34.440 --> 02:32:35.440
Well you do that.

02:32:35.440 --> 02:32:37.040
So you're the little bitch.

02:32:37.040 --> 02:32:38.040
It's not the goose.

02:32:38.040 --> 02:32:40.040
What'd you call me?

02:32:40.040 --> 02:32:41.560
Well, whatever.

02:32:41.560 --> 02:32:42.560
It's fine.

02:32:43.560 --> 02:32:53.000
But no, it gave me the same amount of happiness that I got when I first played Katamari Damacy.

02:32:53.000 --> 02:32:55.000
It was just amazing.

02:32:55.000 --> 02:33:04.800
And there's nothing really fancy or spectacular about this game, but it's fun.

02:33:04.800 --> 02:33:10.600
I feel like I know what it's like to be a goose now because they're just jerks and that's

02:33:10.600 --> 02:33:12.480
all you do in this game is be a jerk.

02:33:12.480 --> 02:33:13.480
And I love it.

02:33:13.480 --> 02:33:16.200
I'm glad you said it so I didn't have to.

02:33:16.200 --> 02:33:22.560
Yeah, but it's not very long and it's on sale right now for 15 instead of 20, which was

02:33:22.560 --> 02:33:25.720
also a nice little bonus.

02:33:25.720 --> 02:33:30.640
But you're given like a set of tasks for each area.

02:33:30.640 --> 02:33:36.280
And once you complete a certain amount of tasks, which is almost always the whole list

02:33:36.280 --> 02:33:40.600
or close to it rather, you get to go on to another area.

02:33:40.600 --> 02:33:46.880
And there's only four areas, I believe, four main areas at least.

02:33:46.880 --> 02:33:52.640
And I beat the game in as hard of quote marks as I can use with my fingers.

02:33:52.640 --> 02:33:57.440
But after you beat it and you go through the credits, you're given a whole other list of

02:33:57.440 --> 02:33:58.440
tasks.

02:33:58.440 --> 02:34:02.400
And I don't know if it opens up more areas because I stopped playing that and we were

02:34:02.400 --> 02:34:07.680
showing Dustin's coworker, Sayonara Wild Hearts.

02:34:07.680 --> 02:34:14.080
So Sayonara Wild Hearts.

02:34:14.080 --> 02:34:16.860
So I don't know, maybe there's like a lot of replayability.

02:34:16.860 --> 02:34:18.140
I want a second game.

02:34:18.140 --> 02:34:19.920
I want DLC.

02:34:19.920 --> 02:34:24.160
I don't want to be a different goose, though, because this goose is the best one.

02:34:24.160 --> 02:34:27.120
Sorry, I'm laughing at the video.

02:34:27.120 --> 02:34:30.160
He just he just snatched those paper towels right back from her.

02:34:30.160 --> 02:34:34.120
Yeah, you have to do this sort of stuff like you have to get creative.

02:34:34.120 --> 02:34:39.720
I had to get this guy's hat and I couldn't reach his head.

02:34:39.720 --> 02:34:49.240
So I had to like, put something that he would pick up that I had moved over by like a mound

02:34:49.240 --> 02:34:50.240
of dirt.

02:34:50.240 --> 02:34:53.800
And I just stood there waiting for him to go pick it up and I snatched his hat and ran

02:34:53.800 --> 02:34:54.920
away with it.

02:34:54.920 --> 02:34:55.920
It was great.

02:34:55.920 --> 02:34:58.880
Okay, I'm running out of b rolls, I gotta go back to the studio.

02:34:58.880 --> 02:34:59.880
But that's fine.

02:34:59.880 --> 02:35:02.000
I mean, the game does look hilarious.

02:35:02.000 --> 02:35:05.200
Again, there were a lot of good games that came out this week.

02:35:05.200 --> 02:35:08.600
And I think most people are fixated on Link's Awakening, which I get it.

02:35:08.600 --> 02:35:09.600
It's fine.

02:35:09.600 --> 02:35:10.600
It's a great game.

02:35:10.600 --> 02:35:11.600
That should be one of the games you're playing.

02:35:11.600 --> 02:35:15.400
But like, you know, there's these other great releases that came out and I know Shane is

02:35:15.400 --> 02:35:17.040
all about the Untitled Goose Game.

02:35:17.040 --> 02:35:21.920
I'm all about Sayonara Wild Hearts and honestly, I'll probably like the goose game too.

02:35:21.920 --> 02:35:24.360
And Shane, you like Sayonara Wild Hearts, right?

02:35:24.360 --> 02:35:26.080
Yeah, I haven't played it a lot.

02:35:26.080 --> 02:35:27.080
I watched it mostly.

02:35:27.080 --> 02:35:32.360
But when I did play, I was trying to do those riddles.

02:35:32.360 --> 02:35:34.320
And it was fun.

02:35:34.320 --> 02:35:36.240
It's just 80s nonsense.

02:35:36.240 --> 02:35:43.040
And 80s nonsense is a great way to describe this game, quite honestly.

02:35:43.040 --> 02:35:44.120
Yeah.

02:35:44.120 --> 02:35:47.720
But it's not better than Untitled Goose Game and we picked up Zelda.

02:35:47.720 --> 02:35:51.840
I haven't even opened it yet because I'm like, these games are way too fun.

02:35:51.840 --> 02:35:55.320
I don't even care about Zelda right now.

02:35:55.800 --> 02:35:58.080
Yeah, it's a busy week.

02:35:58.080 --> 02:36:01.800
And then on top of all that, it's like, oh, and I've got to play Final Fantasy 14 as well

02:36:01.800 --> 02:36:04.280
and all my MMOs and all that stuff too.

02:36:04.280 --> 02:36:06.760
So it's been a week.

02:36:06.760 --> 02:36:07.760
Yeah.

02:36:07.760 --> 02:36:14.080
But I suggest anybody that even liked that footage, the littlest bit, it's so much better

02:36:14.080 --> 02:36:15.080
than that.

02:36:15.080 --> 02:36:17.280
I locked a lady in a garage.

02:36:17.280 --> 02:36:19.640
Like that's how great this game is.

02:36:19.640 --> 02:36:21.120
That's awesome.

02:36:21.120 --> 02:36:23.440
So it's on sale right now.

02:36:23.440 --> 02:36:25.020
Go get it.

02:36:25.020 --> 02:36:26.020
You won't be disappointed.

02:36:26.020 --> 02:36:32.180
All right, quickly, before I let you go, the last Pokemon Community Day that we had was

02:36:32.180 --> 02:36:33.740
Turtwig, right?

02:36:33.740 --> 02:36:34.740
Yeah.

02:36:34.740 --> 02:36:37.440
How many shiny Turtwigs did you pick up?

02:36:37.440 --> 02:36:38.440
Not that many.

02:36:38.440 --> 02:36:42.340
It was not a great time yet again.

02:36:42.340 --> 02:36:45.240
I think it was under 10.

02:36:45.240 --> 02:36:47.260
So I just didn't care either.

02:36:47.260 --> 02:36:48.260
It was Turtwig.

02:36:48.260 --> 02:36:52.620
This might have been the first Community Day ever I got more than you.

02:36:52.620 --> 02:36:57.900
Well, I'm literally looking right now just to make sure and I didn't trade any so I should

02:36:57.900 --> 02:37:00.680
see one.

02:37:00.680 --> 02:37:02.460
I got 10 exactly.

02:37:02.460 --> 02:37:03.780
All right.

02:37:03.780 --> 02:37:04.780
Yeah.

02:37:04.780 --> 02:37:05.780
All right.

02:37:05.780 --> 02:37:09.740
I'll just wait till next June when Oshawott should have his Community Day.

02:37:09.740 --> 02:37:12.060
So Oh, and it's on.

02:37:12.060 --> 02:37:18.040
I see in chat what systems it's on switch, Mac and Windows.

02:37:18.040 --> 02:37:19.500
And I think that's it.

02:37:19.500 --> 02:37:22.060
Is it an Epic Store exclusive because I see their feature?

02:37:22.060 --> 02:37:23.060
It is.

02:37:23.060 --> 02:37:24.060
Yeah.

02:37:24.060 --> 02:37:25.060
Boy.

02:37:25.060 --> 02:37:26.060
There they go again.

02:37:26.060 --> 02:37:27.060
All right.

02:37:27.060 --> 02:37:28.060
All right.

02:37:28.060 --> 02:37:29.060
Well, Shane, thanks for the call.

02:37:29.060 --> 02:37:32.240
I'm glad you know, since we missed it, you know, Loki and I weren't able to play the

02:37:32.240 --> 02:37:33.240
game this week.

02:37:33.240 --> 02:37:34.900
I'm glad somebody did and talk to us about it.

02:37:34.900 --> 02:37:36.460
So I will definitely check it out.

02:37:36.460 --> 02:37:38.700
I guess I'll have to pick it up while it's still on sale.

02:37:38.700 --> 02:37:40.580
There is also another game I was going to mention.

02:37:40.580 --> 02:37:44.560
I haven't got a chance to play it yet, but I know it also came out this week as well

02:37:44.560 --> 02:37:50.380
as what the golf and that one looked funny to what's that one about briefly.

02:37:50.600 --> 02:37:53.660
It's like a it's like a golf game, but it's it's strange.

02:37:53.660 --> 02:37:58.380
Each level is not necessarily like how you normally play golf.

02:37:58.380 --> 02:38:00.620
And it's just like the Kirby golf game.

02:38:00.620 --> 02:38:02.200
No, it's very different.

02:38:02.200 --> 02:38:04.380
Like I seriously, you know, definitely go check it out.

02:38:04.380 --> 02:38:08.060
Like there's one level that there's a bunch of people where you're a soccer ball and a

02:38:08.060 --> 02:38:10.860
bunch of people are trying to kick you off a cliff or something like that.

02:38:10.860 --> 02:38:12.300
And you're trying to get to the goal.

02:38:12.300 --> 02:38:14.260
It is just a really weird game.

02:38:14.260 --> 02:38:15.260
All right.

02:38:15.260 --> 02:38:17.740
That's also coming out on switch and PC.

02:38:17.740 --> 02:38:18.740
OK.

02:38:18.820 --> 02:38:23.420
Before I go, I do want to say one more thing about that amazing game of the year that I

02:38:23.420 --> 02:38:24.420
play.

02:38:24.420 --> 02:38:27.820
OK, so because there's no spoilers in this game because you're given your tasks.

02:38:27.820 --> 02:38:30.840
So one of them is you have to get a ribbon on you.

02:38:30.840 --> 02:38:36.700
And the only way to get a ribbon is to steal a ceramic duck, go hide it somewhere and then

02:38:36.700 --> 02:38:41.220
go pose as the duck until the lady comes and puts a ribbon on you.

02:38:41.220 --> 02:38:43.680
I thought that was hilarious.

02:38:43.680 --> 02:38:44.680
That's pretty good.

02:38:44.680 --> 02:38:47.860
It sounds like the type of game that you did you like because you mentioned like you've

02:38:47.860 --> 02:38:51.060
been hanging out with your hubby and coworker and stuff like that.

02:38:51.060 --> 02:38:52.060
Were you all playing it together?

02:38:52.060 --> 02:38:53.060
Just laughing.

02:38:53.060 --> 02:38:54.620
It's probably that game that's like funnier in groups.

02:38:54.620 --> 02:38:58.300
Yeah, it was just me and Dustin for most of it.

02:38:58.300 --> 02:39:04.820
And then his coworker came over and we just all kind of played through the last stage

02:39:04.820 --> 02:39:06.660
and it was hilarious.

02:39:06.660 --> 02:39:08.020
All right.

02:39:08.020 --> 02:39:09.820
All right, Shane.

02:39:09.820 --> 02:39:13.300
If you don't have anything else, I'm gonna let you go for now and we'll talk to you later.

02:39:13.300 --> 02:39:14.300
OK.

02:39:14.300 --> 02:39:15.300
Bye bye.

02:39:15.300 --> 02:39:16.300
All right.

02:39:17.020 --> 02:39:19.100
I don't know if we have to have any last minute story.

02:39:19.100 --> 02:39:20.100
There's nobody else in the green room.

02:39:20.100 --> 02:39:21.420
So I don't know if we have any last minute stories.

02:39:21.420 --> 02:39:24.740
It did seem like it was kind of a slower Newsweek this week, didn't it?

02:39:24.740 --> 02:39:25.940
Yeah, it was pretty slow.

02:39:25.940 --> 02:39:28.220
Like I was looking for stuff and just me.

02:39:28.220 --> 02:39:32.560
Yeah, I know it's almost everybody's playing games with all the stuff that's out there

02:39:32.560 --> 02:39:33.560
to play this week.

02:39:33.560 --> 02:39:34.560
So.

02:39:34.560 --> 02:39:35.560
All right.

02:39:35.560 --> 02:39:36.560
Well, I guess we're going to get everybody's final thoughts and then we're going to wrap

02:39:36.560 --> 02:39:37.560
up.

02:39:37.560 --> 02:39:40.100
By the way, if you are watching live on Twitch, we're going to do the giveaway from the community

02:39:40.100 --> 02:39:42.260
chest one more time during the credits.

02:39:42.260 --> 02:39:47.680
So stay tuned because you might win something and chances are pretty good to actually just

02:39:47.680 --> 02:39:52.940
like because literally everybody who didn't already have it got one and there were still

02:39:52.940 --> 02:39:54.400
like 13 left.

02:39:54.400 --> 02:39:55.400
So yeah.

02:39:55.400 --> 02:39:56.400
Sit tight.

02:39:56.400 --> 02:39:58.620
If you don't have a Twitch Prime thing, you're going to get this Dauntless thing.

02:39:58.620 --> 02:40:02.900
I could see how many viewers we have and it's not as so many that will probably still have

02:40:02.900 --> 02:40:06.140
some gifts left over that we'll have to use in the middle of the week or something.

02:40:06.140 --> 02:40:07.180
I don't know.

02:40:07.180 --> 02:40:09.900
But anyway, I do want to start to wrap up here.

02:40:09.900 --> 02:40:14.220
Thank you, of course, for tuning into Orange Andrado tonight and for participating with

02:40:14.220 --> 02:40:15.220
the show.

02:40:15.220 --> 02:40:16.220
Really appreciate it.

02:40:16.220 --> 02:40:19.260
If you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Andrado, please tell a friend or two about

02:40:19.260 --> 02:40:20.260
the show.

02:40:20.260 --> 02:40:22.700
Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice.

02:40:22.700 --> 02:40:26.680
But if the voices aren't here in our green room waiting to call, how can we get those

02:40:26.680 --> 02:40:27.980
voices out there?

02:40:27.980 --> 02:40:29.780
We need more in our chat and so forth.

02:40:29.780 --> 02:40:32.020
So really appreciate the raids and all that stuff.

02:40:32.020 --> 02:40:33.020
That's really awesome.

02:40:33.020 --> 02:40:35.060
Thank you so much for that.

02:40:35.060 --> 02:40:39.380
And I also want to say a big thanks for that.

02:40:39.380 --> 02:40:43.100
And those of you that do the auto hosting as well on Twitch, all that hosting and stuff

02:40:43.100 --> 02:40:44.380
goes a very long way.

02:40:44.380 --> 02:40:49.100
I will acknowledge some more specifics after the credits as I usually do.

02:40:49.100 --> 02:40:51.780
In the meantime, it's about that time to get everybody's final thoughts.

02:40:51.780 --> 02:40:53.980
We'll be back in seven days to do this all over again.

02:40:53.980 --> 02:40:55.660
Dark Soccer should be back with us.

02:40:55.660 --> 02:41:00.420
I know she's been playing an awful lot of Link's Awakening and her and Dan are further

02:41:00.420 --> 02:41:01.420
in the game than I am.

02:41:01.420 --> 02:41:02.740
So they probably have a lot to say about it.

02:41:02.740 --> 02:41:04.480
I know they're going to want to talk about it as well.

02:41:04.480 --> 02:41:06.980
So we'll get into that in the next week.

02:41:07.580 --> 02:41:09.700
Meanwhile, we're about here to close up shop.

02:41:09.700 --> 02:41:12.220
So Loki, any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?

02:41:12.220 --> 02:41:16.340
I have to play Untitled Goose Game this week and then just work on my game.

02:41:16.340 --> 02:41:17.340
Yeah.

02:41:17.340 --> 02:41:18.340
I want to see.

02:41:18.340 --> 02:41:19.340
I saw like I peeked over your shoulder.

02:41:19.340 --> 02:41:20.500
I saw a little bit of your game.

02:41:20.500 --> 02:41:24.180
It looked like the yeah, you've got like walls and it looks pretty legit.

02:41:24.180 --> 02:41:25.180
Yeah.

02:41:25.180 --> 02:41:26.180
The walls and stuff.

02:41:26.180 --> 02:41:30.260
I just I updated because I deleted my arena that I was in.

02:41:30.260 --> 02:41:34.380
So I re updated everything because it's built out of tiles now.

02:41:34.380 --> 02:41:38.780
And so I had to rebuild everything.

02:41:38.780 --> 02:41:41.620
I have an error, though, so I can't actually play it at the moment.

02:41:41.620 --> 02:41:43.860
I have to fix whatever it is.

02:41:43.860 --> 02:41:44.860
It's something that was working.

02:41:44.860 --> 02:41:47.660
I think when I was taking stuff out, I did a bug fixing.

02:41:47.660 --> 02:41:48.660
Yes.

02:41:48.660 --> 02:41:49.660
That's part of making a game, right?

02:41:49.660 --> 02:41:50.660
Yeah.

02:41:50.660 --> 02:41:52.660
Well, I look forward to being able to play your game at some point.

02:41:52.660 --> 02:41:53.820
All right.

02:41:53.820 --> 02:41:58.100
And my final thought tonight is, oh, busy.

02:41:58.100 --> 02:42:02.260
It's going to be a very busy week and weekend and very busy for the next couple weeks.

02:42:02.260 --> 02:42:05.180
But I hope I get to squeeze in some great game playing myself.

02:42:05.180 --> 02:42:10.300
I still want to get further in Link's Awakening and I got to play this goose game as well

02:42:10.300 --> 02:42:13.380
for myself and whatever else is going to come out in the next couple of weeks.

02:42:13.380 --> 02:42:15.020
It's a great time to be a gamer.

02:42:15.020 --> 02:42:18.140
So that's going to do it for another night here at Orange Lounge Radio.

02:42:18.140 --> 02:42:21.180

Have a great night, everybody.

02:42:28.100 --> 02:42:29.100
Bye bye.
